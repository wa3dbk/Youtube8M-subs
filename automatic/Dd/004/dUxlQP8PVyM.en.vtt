have been riding last year sure well I
mean<00:00:59.340> that<00:00:59.460> there's<00:00:59.670> some<00:00:59.789> quite<00:01:00.000> big

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.520 
experts and very specific things

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.340 
experts and very specific things
including<00:01:53.520> composite<00:01:54.360> layup<00:01:54.600> and<00:01:54.810> analysis

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
including composite layup and analysis

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.830 
including composite layup and analysis
so<00:01:55.979> we<00:01:56.159> took<00:01:56.280> this<00:01:56.430> venge<00:01:56.700> we<00:01:57.390> had<00:01:57.540> the<00:01:57.659> Venge

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
so we took this venge we had the Venge

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.139 
so we took this venge we had the Venge
already<00:01:58.380> essentially<00:01:59.219> designed<00:01:59.670> it<00:02:00.000> was

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
already essentially designed it was

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.660 
already essentially designed it was
being<00:02:00.869> tested<00:02:01.110> at<00:02:01.350> that<00:02:01.500> point<00:02:01.740> with<00:02:02.579> the

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
being tested at that point with the

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.780 
being tested at that point with the
s-works<00:02:02.969> layup<00:02:03.360> and<00:02:03.950> they<00:02:04.950> saw<00:02:05.159> this<00:02:05.310> platform

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
s-works layup and they saw this platform

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.089 
s-works layup and they saw this platform
and<00:02:05.909> said<00:02:06.000> wow<00:02:06.180> this<00:02:06.390> is<00:02:06.540> a<00:02:06.570> perfect<00:02:07.099> launching

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
and said wow this is a perfect launching

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.190 
and said wow this is a perfect launching
pad<00:02:08.310> for<00:02:08.610> what<00:02:08.819> we<00:02:09.090> can<00:02:09.270> help<00:02:09.390> you<00:02:09.539> with<00:02:09.690> so

pad for what we can help you with so

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.440 
pad for what we can help you with so
really<00:02:10.500> what<00:02:10.979> ended<00:02:11.220> up<00:02:11.310> happening<00:02:11.370> is<00:02:11.970> they

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
really what ended up happening is they

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.760 
really what ended up happening is they
design<00:02:12.840> a<00:02:12.870> totally<00:02:13.290> bespoke

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
design a totally bespoke

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.430 
design a totally bespoke
lay<00:02:13.920> off<00:02:14.070> lay<00:02:14.910> up<00:02:15.030> being<00:02:15.300> the<00:02:15.600> the<00:02:15.840> orientation

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
lay off lay up being the the orientation

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.680 
lay off lay up being the the orientation

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
hundred grams lighter quite a bit

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:22.970 
hundred grams lighter quite a bit
stiffer<00:02:21.120> and<00:02:21.450> really<00:02:21.930> retains<00:02:22.410> all<00:02:22.590> the<00:02:22.650> same

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
stiffer and really retains all the same

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.980 
stiffer and really retains all the same
aerodynamic<00:02:23.970> attributes<00:02:24.630> that<00:02:24.720> this<00:02:24.840> bike

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
aerodynamic attributes that this bike

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:27.200 
aerodynamic attributes that this bike
does<00:02:25.170> well<00:02:25.650> the<00:02:25.770> stiffness<00:02:26.250> really<00:02:26.610> counts<00:02:27.060> if

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:27.210 
does well the stiffness really counts if

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:29.120 
does well the stiffness really counts if
you<00:02:27.300> were<00:02:27.420> to<00:02:27.540> watch<00:02:27.690> a<00:02:27.840> slow-motion<00:02:28.290> video<00:02:28.770> of

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
you were to watch a slow-motion video of

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:32.360 
you were to watch a slow-motion video of
a<00:02:29.340> very<00:02:30.150> powerful<00:02:30.450> sprinter<00:02:31.350> getting<00:02:32.280> the

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
a very powerful sprinter getting the

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.460 
a very powerful sprinter getting the
bike<00:02:32.550> up<00:02:32.730> to<00:02:32.760> 45<00:02:33.330> miles<00:02:33.600> an<00:02:33.870> hour<00:02:34.020> you<00:02:34.350> would

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
bike up to 45 miles an hour you would

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.170 
bike up to 45 miles an hour you would
see<00:02:34.680> this<00:02:34.860> part<00:02:35.160> of<00:02:35.280> the<00:02:35.340> bike<00:02:35.520> is<00:02:35.730> actually

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
see this part of the bike is actually

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:37.790 
see this part of the bike is actually
flexing<00:02:36.720> that's<00:02:36.900> right<00:02:37.200> that's<00:02:37.500> right<00:02:37.650> so

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
flexing that's right that's right so

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.180 
flexing that's right that's right so
it's<00:02:38.190> some<00:02:38.400> flex<00:02:38.730> but<00:02:39.060> you<00:02:39.240> but<00:02:39.870> this<00:02:40.020> but<00:02:40.380> that

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
it's some flex but you but this but that

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.280 
it's some flex but you but this but that
drains<00:02:41.550> energy<00:02:41.820> too<00:02:42.330> well<00:02:42.750> you<00:02:42.900> always<00:02:43.020> want

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
drains energy too well you always want

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.380 
drains energy too well you always want
some<00:02:43.560> flex<00:02:43.860> where<00:02:44.100> you<00:02:44.220> need<00:02:44.430> it<00:02:44.580> you<00:02:45.300> know

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
some flex where you need it you know

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:46.670 
some flex where you need it you know
want<00:02:45.600> you<00:02:45.780> know<00:02:45.900> what<00:02:46.020> all<00:02:46.230> that<00:02:46.260> stiffness

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
want you know what all that stiffness

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.060 
want you know what all that stiffness
going<00:02:47.190> you<00:02:47.430> know<00:02:47.520> going<00:02:47.550> into<00:02:48.000> the<00:02:48.150> rider

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:49.070 
going you know going into the rider

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:50.900 
going you know going into the rider
because<00:02:50.070> I<00:02:50.190> that's<00:02:50.400> not<00:02:50.610> a<00:02:50.640> very<00:02:50.820> pleasant

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
because I that's not a very pleasant

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:53.570 
because I that's not a very pleasant
experience<00:02:51.150> so<00:02:52.250> generally<00:02:53.250> we<00:02:53.400> want

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
experience so generally we want

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.550 
experience so generally we want
stiffness<00:02:54.240> where<00:02:54.480> you<00:02:54.960> know<00:02:55.050> where<00:02:55.230> we<00:02:55.380> need

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
stiffness where you know where we need

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.490 
stiffness where you know where we need
it<00:02:55.590> in<00:02:56.370> the<00:02:56.520> example<00:02:57.030> of<00:02:57.240> a<00:02:57.540> rider<00:02:58.020> pedaling

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
it in the example of a rider pedaling

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.560 
it in the example of a rider pedaling
really<00:02:58.680> hard<00:02:58.890> or<00:02:59.070> sprinting<00:02:59.490> of<00:02:59.640> course<00:03:00.390> we

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570 
really hard or sprinting of course we

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:04.280 
really hard or sprinting of course we
want<00:03:00.750> to<00:03:00.810> have<00:03:00.960> a<00:03:00.990> very<00:03:01.440> stiff<00:03:01.740> chassis<00:03:03.290> having

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
want to have a very stiff chassis having

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.320 
want to have a very stiff chassis having
the<00:03:04.380> whip<00:03:04.590> here<00:03:04.890> in<00:03:04.980> the<00:03:05.070> head<00:03:05.250> tube<00:03:05.490> really

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
the whip here in the head tube really

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.330 
the whip here in the head tube really
matters<00:03:06.660> and<00:03:06.930> carrying<00:03:07.800> that<00:03:07.920> width<00:03:08.160> down

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
matters and carrying that width down

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.730 
matters and carrying that width down
into<00:03:08.670> the<00:03:08.790> down<00:03:09.000> tube<00:03:09.290> really<00:03:10.290> allows<00:03:10.500> this

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:10.740 
into the down tube really allows this

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:13.340 
into the down tube really allows this
area<00:03:11.100> to<00:03:11.220> flex<00:03:11.460> less<00:03:11.760> under<00:03:12.060> load<00:03:12.350> another

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350 
area to flex less under load another

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:15.560 
area to flex less under load another
area<00:03:13.740> rich<00:03:13.920> is<00:03:14.130> the<00:03:14.450> essentially<00:03:15.450> their

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:15.570 
area rich is the essentially their

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:18.320 
area rich is the essentially their
drivetrain<00:03:16.020> stiffness<00:03:16.470> so<00:03:17.340> if<00:03:17.790> we<00:03:18.150> have<00:03:18.300> a

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:18.330 
drivetrain stiffness so if we have a

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:20.210 
drivetrain stiffness so if we have a
drivetrain<00:03:18.959> you<00:03:19.410> know<00:03:19.500> chain<00:03:19.770> stays<00:03:19.980> that<00:03:20.130> are

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
drivetrain you know chain stays that are

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.730 
drivetrain you know chain stays that are
very<00:03:20.430> narrow<00:03:20.700> and<00:03:21.000> very<00:03:21.090> flexible<00:03:21.900> when<00:03:22.620> you

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:22.740 
very narrow and very flexible when you

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:24.470 
very narrow and very flexible when you
pedal<00:03:22.920> that<00:03:23.160> hard<00:03:23.430> the<00:03:23.880> bikes<00:03:24.090> going<00:03:24.270> to<00:03:24.330> be

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
pedal that hard the bikes going to be

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.350 
pedal that hard the bikes going to be
going<00:03:24.810> side<00:03:24.990> to<00:03:25.020> side<00:03:25.260> right<00:03:25.520> so<00:03:26.520> we

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:27.360 
going side to side right so we

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.090 
going side to side right so we
manufacture<00:03:27.870> in<00:03:27.990> such<00:03:28.140> a<00:03:28.170> way<00:03:28.410> that<00:03:28.440> the

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.100 
manufacture in such a way that the

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:30.650 
manufacture in such a way that the
bottom<00:03:29.400> bracket<00:03:29.490> area<00:03:29.940> and<00:03:30.060> chain<00:03:30.209> stays<00:03:30.450> are

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
bottom bracket area and chain stays are

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:33.140 
bottom bracket area and chain stays are
all<00:03:31.050> molded<00:03:31.620> in<00:03:31.680> one<00:03:31.800> piece<00:03:32.010> and<00:03:32.250> the<00:03:32.970> cross

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
all molded in one piece and the cross

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.990 
all molded in one piece and the cross
section<00:03:33.540> is<00:03:33.720> you<00:03:34.230> know<00:03:34.290> significantly<00:03:35.000> beefed

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
section is you know significantly beefed

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.780 
section is you know significantly beefed
up<00:03:36.410> for<00:03:37.410> stiffness<00:03:37.650> anybody<00:03:38.430> who's<00:03:38.550> watched

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
up for stiffness anybody who's watched

Olympic cycling or great races like the

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:44.510 
Olympic cycling or great races like the
Tour<00:03:41.760> de<00:03:41.910> France<00:03:42.500> there's<00:03:43.500> usually<00:03:43.709> a<00:03:44.100> part<00:03:44.430> of

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:44.520 
Tour de France there's usually a part of

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:46.490 
Tour de France there's usually a part of
the<00:03:44.610> race<00:03:44.790> called<00:03:45.209> the<00:03:45.450> individual<00:03:46.110> time

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
the race called the individual time

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.860 
the race called the individual time
trial<00:03:47.010> and<00:03:47.310> that's<00:03:48.030> where<00:03:48.270> you<00:03:48.390> make<00:03:48.570> bikes

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
trial and that's where you make bikes

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:51.740 
trial and that's where you make bikes
like<00:03:49.200> this<00:03:49.410> this<00:03:49.800> is<00:03:50.010> the<00:03:50.250> special<00:03:51.060> live<00:03:51.209> Shiv

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:54.650 
like this this is the special live Shiv
Mike<00:03:52.740> talk<00:03:53.100> about<00:03:53.400> all<00:03:53.670> the<00:03:53.820> technology<00:03:54.180> that

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660 
Mike talk about all the technology that

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:56.630 
Mike talk about all the technology that
goes<00:03:54.780> into<00:03:54.840> a<00:03:55.200> great<00:03:55.470> time<00:03:55.740> trial<00:03:56.130> bike

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:56.640 
goes into a great time trial bike

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:00.080 
goes into a great time trial bike
well<00:03:57.480> the<00:03:57.600> Shiv<00:03:57.840> the<00:03:58.140> time<00:03:58.410> trial<00:03:58.709> is<00:03:58.920> is<00:03:59.160> one

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
well the Shiv the time trial is is one

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:02.240 
well the Shiv the time trial is is one
of<00:04:00.120> the<00:04:00.270> most<00:04:00.390> critical<00:04:00.870> parts<00:04:01.830> of<00:04:01.980> the<00:04:02.070> race

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 
of the most critical parts of the race

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:05.000 
of the most critical parts of the race
of<00:04:02.520> the<00:04:02.700> Tour<00:04:03.000> de<00:04:03.120> France<00:04:03.390> and<00:04:03.860> designing<00:04:04.860> that

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.010 
of the Tour de France and designing that

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:08.030 
of the Tour de France and designing that
bike<00:04:05.360> to<00:04:06.360> be<00:04:06.510> the<00:04:06.690> most<00:04:06.890> aerodynamic<00:04:07.890> is

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
bike to be the most aerodynamic is

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.430 
bike to be the most aerodynamic is
really<00:04:08.850> a<00:04:08.880> big<00:04:09.120> feat<00:04:09.390> in<00:04:09.600> fact<00:04:09.870> when<00:04:10.410> we

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.440 
really a big feat in fact when we

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:13.790 
really a big feat in fact when we
designed<00:04:11.040> this<00:04:11.280> we<00:04:12.209> had<00:04:12.420> to<00:04:12.600> redesign<00:04:12.959> it<00:04:13.350> two

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:13.800 
designed this we had to redesign it two

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:15.830 
designed this we had to redesign it two
different<00:04:14.160> times<00:04:14.400> because<00:04:14.880> it<00:04:15.060> was<00:04:15.239> it<00:04:15.660> was

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 
different times because it was it was

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:18.500 
different times because it was it was
too<00:04:16.049> fast<00:04:16.260> it<00:04:16.950> was<00:04:17.100> too<00:04:17.310> aerodynamic<00:04:18.150> so<00:04:18.359> the

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:18.510 
too fast it was too aerodynamic so the

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:21.680 
too fast it was too aerodynamic so the
UCI<00:04:18.870> made<00:04:19.739> us<00:04:19.919> change<00:04:20.160> it<00:04:20.400> but<00:04:20.970> but<00:04:21.359> really

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:21.690 
UCI made us change it but but really

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:25.610 
UCI made us change it but but really
having<00:04:22.020> this<00:04:22.140> very<00:04:22.470> sleek<00:04:22.919> bike<00:04:23.550> like<00:04:23.820> this<00:04:24.620> it

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 
having this very sleek bike like this it

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.170 
having this very sleek bike like this it
makes<00:04:25.919> a<00:04:26.130> big<00:04:26.400> difference

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 
makes a big difference

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:30.020 
makes a big difference
the<00:04:27.620> aerodynamic<00:04:28.620> profile<00:04:29.130> just<00:04:29.430> like<00:04:29.669> a<00:04:29.699> wing

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:30.030 
the aerodynamic profile just like a wing

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:31.730 
the aerodynamic profile just like a wing
of<00:04:30.180> an<00:04:30.330> airplane<00:04:30.509> I<00:04:30.930> know<00:04:31.080> you've<00:04:31.320> been<00:04:31.440> asked

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:31.740 
of an airplane I know you've been asked

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:33.529 
of an airplane I know you've been asked
this<00:04:31.770> question<00:04:31.889> throughout<00:04:32.729> your<00:04:32.880> 40<00:04:33.330> years

00:04:33.529 --> 00:04:33.539 
this question throughout your 40 years

00:04:33.539 --> 00:04:35.900 
this question throughout your 40 years
but<00:04:33.810> you<00:04:33.960> look<00:04:34.139> at<00:04:34.259> a<00:04:34.289> bike<00:04:34.500> like<00:04:34.740> this<00:04:34.910> with

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:35.910 
but you look at a bike like this with

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:37.760 
but you look at a bike like this with
all<00:04:36.030> the<00:04:36.150> computer-aided<00:04:36.600> design<00:04:37.110> and<00:04:37.710> the

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:37.770 
all the computer-aided design and the

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:39.320 
all the computer-aided design and the
Windtunnel<00:04:38.250> testing<00:04:38.759> and<00:04:38.970> the<00:04:39.030> exotic

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:39.330 
Windtunnel testing and the exotic

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:41.360 
Windtunnel testing and the exotic
materials<00:04:40.080> and<00:04:40.380> you<00:04:40.440> say<00:04:40.650> how<00:04:41.070> can<00:04:41.250> they

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:41.370 
materials and you say how can they

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:43.730 
materials and you say how can they
possibly<00:04:41.520> get<00:04:42.090> any<00:04:42.240> better<00:04:42.509> can<00:04:43.380> they<00:04:43.530> get<00:04:43.710> any

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:43.740 
possibly get any better can they get any

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:47.689 
possibly get any better can they get any
better<00:04:44.070> they<00:04:44.880> can<00:04:44.940> and<00:04:45.680> every<00:04:46.680> year<00:04:46.949> we<00:04:47.520> always

00:04:47.689 --> 00:04:47.699 
better they can and every year we always

00:04:47.699 --> 00:04:49.040 
better they can and every year we always
say<00:04:48.000> innovate<00:04:48.479> or<00:04:48.600> die

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:49.050 
say innovate or die

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:50.960 
say innovate or die
and<00:04:49.139> every<00:04:49.860> year<00:04:49.889> the<00:04:50.160> bikes<00:04:50.370> do<00:04:50.550> get<00:04:50.759> better

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:50.970 
and every year the bikes do get better

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:53.480 
and every year the bikes do get better
in<00:04:51.380> seven<00:04:52.380> to<00:04:52.470> ten<00:04:52.680> years<00:04:52.710> from<00:04:53.039> now<00:04:53.130> you'll<00:04:53.460> be

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:53.490 
in seven to ten years from now you'll be

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:55.460 
in seven to ten years from now you'll be
looking<00:04:53.880> at<00:04:53.970> a<00:04:54.060> bike<00:04:54.240> like<00:04:54.479> this<00:04:54.509> and<00:04:55.380> you'll

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:55.470 
looking at a bike like this and you'll

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:57.110 
looking at a bike like this and you'll
think<00:04:55.680> this<00:04:55.889> looks<00:04:56.160> really<00:04:56.220> old<00:04:56.520> and<00:04:57.000> this

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:57.120 
think this looks really old and this

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:00.650 
think this looks really old and this
weighs<00:04:57.360> Jeep<00:04:58.139> 16<00:04:58.889> pounds<00:04:59.370> that's<00:04:59.490> heavy<00:04:59.759> the

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:00.660 
weighs Jeep 16 pounds that's heavy the

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:03.980 
weighs Jeep 16 pounds that's heavy the
new<00:05:00.840> bikes<00:05:01.080> weigh<00:05:01.880> 12<00:05:02.880> pounds<00:05:03.360> and<00:05:03.479> they're

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:03.990 
new bikes weigh 12 pounds and they're

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:07.699 
new bikes weigh 12 pounds and they're
more<00:05:04.199> aerodynamic<00:05:05.070> and<00:05:05.220> stiffer
