hexagon<00:00:21.650> designed<00:00:22.970> TPU<00:00:23.970> cases<00:00:24.269> now<00:00:24.839> as<00:00:25.199> I've

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
hexagon designed TPU cases now as I've

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.390 
hexagon designed TPU cases now as I've
said<00:00:25.679> before<00:00:25.740> in<00:00:27.320> various<00:00:28.320> other<00:00:28.589> tutorials

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
said before in various other tutorials

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.319 
said before in various other tutorials
and<00:00:30.029> reviews<00:00:30.179> what<00:00:30.810> TPU<00:00:31.320> stands<00:00:31.650> for<00:00:32.070> is<00:00:33.060> it's

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
and reviews what TPU stands for is it's

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.650 
and reviews what TPU stands for is it's
a<00:00:33.420> mixture<00:00:33.840> of<00:00:33.989> silicone<00:00:34.829> and<00:00:35.130> rubber<00:00:35.660> fused

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
a mixture of silicone and rubber fused

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.450 
a mixture of silicone and rubber fused
together<00:00:36.900> so<00:00:37.470> before<00:00:37.830> you<00:00:37.920> have<00:00:38.100> the<00:00:38.220> rubber

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
together so before you have the rubber

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.100 
together so before you have the rubber
and<00:00:38.910> then<00:00:39.090> you<00:00:39.270> before<00:00:39.750> you<00:00:39.840> have<00:00:39.990> the

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
and then you before you have the

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.140 
and then you before you have the
silicone<00:00:40.620> separate<00:00:41.130> cases<00:00:41.370> while<00:00:41.760> they<00:00:41.910> mix

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:42.150 
silicone separate cases while they mix

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:44.540 
silicone separate cases while they mix
them<00:00:42.360> together<00:00:42.560> to<00:00:43.560> get<00:00:43.740> a<00:00:43.770> really<00:00:44.340> cool

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
them together to get a really cool

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.290 
them together to get a really cool
looking<00:00:44.880> case<00:00:45.150> and<00:00:45.600> it's<00:00:46.470> it's<00:00:46.970> flexible<00:00:47.970> just

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
looking case and it's it's flexible just

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.860 
looking case and it's it's flexible just
like<00:00:48.540> silicone<00:00:49.260> is<00:00:49.970> but<00:00:50.970> with<00:00:51.270> the<00:00:51.480> rubber

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
like silicone is but with the rubber

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.530 
like silicone is but with the rubber
aspect<00:00:52.440> that<00:00:52.650> it<00:00:52.920> doesn't<00:00:53.400> collect<00:00:53.700> dust<00:00:54.180> at

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:54.540 
aspect that it doesn't collect dust at

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:56.270 
aspect that it doesn't collect dust at
all<00:00:54.840> on<00:00:55.200> here<00:00:55.500> and<00:00:55.590> if<00:00:55.650> it<00:00:55.770> does<00:00:55.950> you<00:00:56.100> just

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
all on here and if it does you just

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.790 
all on here and if it does you just
brush<00:00:56.520> it<00:00:56.550> off<00:00:56.850> where<00:00:57.180> silicon<00:00:57.720> it<00:00:58.260> stayed<00:00:58.620> on

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
brush it off where silicon it stayed on

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.830 
brush it off where silicon it stayed on
and<00:00:58.980> you'd<00:00:59.100> have<00:00:59.250> to<00:00:59.370> rinse<00:00:59.580> it<00:00:59.850> off<00:00:59.970> and<00:01:00.390> and

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
and you'd have to rinse it off and and

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.840 
and you'd have to rinse it off and and
whatnot<00:01:01.290> these<00:01:01.770> are<00:01:01.920> super<00:01:02.220> tight<00:01:02.400> fitting

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
whatnot these are super tight fitting

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.609 
whatnot these are super tight fitting
cases<00:01:03.330> so<00:01:03.570> they<00:01:03.690> fit<00:01:03.930> great<00:01:04.110> there's<00:01:04.470> no

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
cases so they fit great there's no

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.429 
cases so they fit great there's no
flimsy<00:01:05.810> corners<00:01:06.810> or<00:01:06.990> anything<00:01:07.259> like<00:01:07.290> that
