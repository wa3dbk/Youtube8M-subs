00:00:11.565 --> 00:00:17.508
 The Invincible Soldier Maeda Jun Ã— Yanagi Nagi Translation by HakuDouga (YouTube) 

00:00:20.712 --> 00:00:25.117
 A soldier who was known to be invincible fell before me. 

00:00:25.167 --> 00:00:28.003
 The audience was excited immediately. 

00:00:28.003 --> 00:00:31.486
 Then I realized that was my victory. 

00:00:31.486 --> 00:00:38.592
 I never expected such a farewell! 

00:00:38.731 --> 00:00:41.332
 I lived as a rogue. Chan! Chan! 

00:00:41.332 --> 00:00:43.500
 Blood spurted over his throat. Ba! Ba! 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.500
 If you want to live, then ... 

00:00:45.836 --> 00:00:48.019
 ... you have no choice but to do so much. 

00:00:48.205 --> 00:00:50.337
 The sound of this gold bag. Cha! Cha! 

00:00:50.434 --> 00:00:52.670
 Big brother said I should give it to him. Ka! Ka! 

00:00:52.667 --> 00:00:54.800
 Or I am mercilessly beaten. Ga! Ga! 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:01:05.805
 That was the worst place. I had no choice but to live there. 

00:01:05.805 --> 00:01:15.305
 But then you came before me. 

00:01:24.706 --> 00:01:28.932
 Here you are known as an invincible soldier. 

00:01:28.932 --> 00:01:32.648
 You kill all the villains. 

00:01:32.648 --> 00:01:42.650
 Big Brother always yelled at the gang and told them not to waver. 

00:01:43.143 --> 00:01:45.330
 Before my eyes inject a lot of blood. Ba! Ba! 

00:01:45.326 --> 00:01:47.510
 With ease and without consideration. Sha! Sha! 

00:01:47.508 --> 00:01:52.060
 Big brother panicked and tried to escape, but ... 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.610
 From his back, no. From his dead body you grab the treasure. 

00:01:56.611 --> 00:01:58.890
 And you say to me 

00:01:58.886 --> 00:02:11.740
 "Are you hurt? Everything is okay, even when you are alone. " 

00:02:12.122 --> 00:02:19.320
 "Would you like to come home with me?" 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:28.420
 Since that day, I've been hiking with you as your apprentice. 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:42.350
 I intended to steal all your techniques and then start all over again. 

00:03:00.514 --> 00:03:09.520
 We saw the same things and spent a lot of time together. 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.320
 The reason I was captured as a rogue back then was ... 

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:38.400
 ... because this bad habit has been engraved on me for a long time. 

00:03:38.732 --> 00:03:48.300
 I tried to steal the sword that the shopkeeper showed me with great interest. 

00:03:48.809 --> 00:03:51.080
 That's bad, he noticed! 

00:03:51.085 --> 00:03:53.230
 I pulled the sword and remembered the feeling 

00:03:53.233 --> 00:03:57.840
 ... how it was to slash and kill. 

00:03:57.935 --> 00:04:00.070
 Unfortunately you have seen me. 

00:04:00.071 --> 00:04:02.580
 I was prepared for it like my big brother back then. 

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:04.200
 I am most certainly killed. 

00:04:04.204 --> 00:04:09.130
 You said to me 

00:04:09.313 --> 00:04:27.610
 "Have a duel with me to cut your way!" 

00:04:46.272 --> 00:04:50.430
 Within the crowd, I saw your defeated self. 

00:04:50.467 --> 00:04:56.640
 You did not fight with your dominating hand. 

00:04:57.006 --> 00:05:07.130
 Maybe it would be better if we had met in a different way ...
