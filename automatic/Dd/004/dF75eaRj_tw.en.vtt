so today we're gonna go to a place when
I<00:01:02.030> click<00:01:02.329> here<00:01:02.510> on<00:01:02.570> place<00:01:02.960> and<00:01:03.829> let's<00:01:04.129> say<00:01:04.339> we

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:04.489 
I click here on place and let's say we

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:10.210 
I click here on place and let's say we
want<00:01:04.729> to<00:01:04.790> find<00:01:05.140> the<00:01:06.140> nearest<00:01:06.409> ATM<00:01:09.040> so<00:01:10.040> it's

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:10.220 
want to find the nearest ATM so it's

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:13.060 
want to find the nearest ATM so it's
listing<00:01:10.640> them<00:01:10.820> in<00:01:10.850> order<00:01:11.210> of<00:01:11.770> what's<00:01:12.770> most

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:13.070 
listing them in order of what's most

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:14.820 
listing them in order of what's most
close<00:01:13.520> to<00:01:13.550> where<00:01:13.970> we're<00:01:14.150> currently<00:01:14.420> located

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:14.830 
close to where we're currently located

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:18.969 
close to where we're currently located
so<00:01:15.830> let's<00:01:16.070> say<00:01:16.930> the<00:01:17.930> closest<00:01:18.380> one<00:01:18.560> is<00:01:18.590> Bank<00:01:18.860> of

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:18.979

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:21.219 
so let's say the closest one is Bank of
America<00:01:19.460> but<00:01:19.670> you<00:01:19.820> bank<00:01:20.090> with<00:01:20.180> Key<00:01:20.510> Bank<00:01:20.690> let's

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:21.229 
America but you bank with Key Bank let's

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:25.719 
America but you bank with Key Bank let's
click<00:01:21.530> on<00:01:21.680> Key<00:01:21.950> Bank<00:01:23.830> and<00:01:24.830> it's<00:01:25.010> calculating<00:01:25.670> a

route<00:01:25.940> and<00:01:26.270> showing<00:01:26.570> us<00:01:26.720> where<00:01:26.960> we<00:01:27.140> are<00:01:27.290> in

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:27.470 
route and showing us where we are in

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:30.550 
route and showing us where we are in
relationship<00:01:27.979> to<00:01:28.190> that<00:01:28.450> so<00:01:29.450> we're<00:01:29.780> here<00:01:30.260> and

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560
