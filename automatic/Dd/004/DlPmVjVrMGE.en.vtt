00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:20.920 
around turn off the bun and as you guys
see<00:01:18.590> it<00:01:18.710> is<00:01:18.830> a<00:01:18.860> very<00:01:19.250> very<00:01:19.610> slim<00:01:20.060> adds<00:01:20.300> no<00:01:20.660> bulk

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:20.930 
see it is a very very slim adds no bulk

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.860 
see it is a very very slim adds no bulk
whatsoever<00:01:21.830> and<00:01:22.150> you<00:01:23.150> guys<00:01:23.270> see<00:01:23.390> it<00:01:23.510> does<00:01:23.690> have

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:23.870 
whatsoever and you guys see it does have

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:26.230 
whatsoever and you guys see it does have
a<00:01:23.900> marshmallow<00:01:24.500> texture<00:01:25.159> to<00:01:25.340> it<00:01:25.370> and<00:01:25.610> the<00:01:26.030> same

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:26.240 
a marshmallow texture to it and the same

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:27.880 
a marshmallow texture to it and the same
on<00:01:26.270> all<00:01:26.420> of<00:01:26.690> them<00:01:26.780> so<00:01:27.380> that<00:01:27.409> marshmallow

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:27.890 
on all of them so that marshmallow

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:29.170 
on all of them so that marshmallow
texture<00:01:28.340> I<00:01:28.370> guess<00:01:28.520> that's<00:01:28.700> the<00:01:28.760> best<00:01:29.000> way<00:01:29.120> to

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:29.180 
texture I guess that's the best way to

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:31.690 
texture I guess that's the best way to
describe<00:01:29.390> it<00:01:29.570> very<00:01:29.840> smooth<00:01:30.170> very<00:01:30.409> soft<00:01:30.950> esther

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
describe it very smooth very soft esther

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.310 
describe it very smooth very soft esther
button<00:01:31.970> has<00:01:32.090> a<00:01:32.120> completely<00:01:32.570> exposed<00:01:32.990> bottom

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:33.320 
button has a completely exposed bottom

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:34.780 
button has a completely exposed bottom
so<00:01:33.440> you<00:01:33.470> go<00:01:33.680> ahead<00:01:33.710> and<00:01:33.830> dock<00:01:34.100> this<00:01:34.310> in<00:01:34.490> most<00:01:34.640> of

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:34.790 
so you go ahead and dock this in most of

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:36.460 
so you go ahead and dock this in most of
your<00:01:34.880> docs<00:01:35.090> and<00:01:35.360> it<00:01:35.810> does<00:01:35.960> have<00:01:36.140> a<00:01:36.170> little

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:36.470 
your docs and it does have a little

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:39.609 
your docs and it does have a little
cover<00:01:37.270> see<00:01:38.270> if<00:01:38.330> we<00:01:38.390> can<00:01:38.540> focus<00:01:38.659> that<00:01:38.930> up<00:01:39.080> above

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:39.619 
cover see if we can focus that up above

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:41.410 
cover see if we can focus that up above
the<00:01:39.890> volume<00:01:40.159> rocker<00:01:40.369> and<00:01:40.700> the<00:01:40.850> vibrate<00:01:41.299> switch

the volume rocker and the vibrate switch
to<00:01:41.780> protect<00:01:42.110> them<00:01:42.290> but<00:01:42.710> you<00:01:42.830> can<00:01:42.950> still<00:01:43.130> access

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:43.340 
to protect them but you can still access

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:45.640 
to protect them but you can still access
them<00:01:43.670> just<00:01:43.940> fine<00:01:44.150> along<00:01:44.930> with<00:01:44.960> your<00:01:45.320> vibrate

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
see that design on the back now one

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:06.999 
see that design on the back now one
thing<00:02:05.450> that<00:02:05.600> confuses<00:02:06.170> me<00:02:06.590> is<00:02:06.619> these<00:02:06.799> two

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:07.009 
thing that confuses me is these two

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:08.440 
thing that confuses me is these two
little<00:02:07.159> tabs<00:02:07.430> at<00:02:07.700> the<00:02:07.729> bottom<00:02:07.820> I<00:02:08.119> used<00:02:08.330> to

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
little tabs at the bottom I used to

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:09.759 
little tabs at the bottom I used to
think<00:02:08.600> that<00:02:08.720> there<00:02:08.899> for<00:02:09.140> the<00:02:09.200> speakers<00:02:09.590> but

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:09.769 
think that there for the speakers but

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:11.590 
think that there for the speakers but
when<00:02:09.890> I<00:02:09.920> put<00:02:10.160> them<00:02:10.250> on<00:02:10.369> I<00:02:10.480> noticed<00:02:11.480> the

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:11.600 
when I put them on I noticed the

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.180 
when I put them on I noticed the
speakers<00:02:11.930> aren't<00:02:12.110> right<00:02:12.260> there<00:02:12.470> so<00:02:12.920> I<00:02:12.950> don't

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
speakers aren't right there so I don't

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.310 
speakers aren't right there so I don't
know<00:02:13.370> what<00:02:13.519> those<00:02:13.610> are<00:02:13.670> for<00:02:13.850> as<00:02:14.810> for<00:02:15.110> in<00:02:15.230> the

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:15.320 
know what those are for as for in the

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:16.840 
know what those are for as for in the
hand<00:02:15.470> feel<00:02:15.680> it<00:02:15.799> does<00:02:15.950> provide<00:02:16.220> a<00:02:16.280> nice<00:02:16.549> in<00:02:16.760> the

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:16.850 
hand feel it does provide a nice in the

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:18.400 
hand feel it does provide a nice in the
hand<00:02:16.880> feel<00:02:17.209> a<00:02:17.390> little<00:02:17.690> bit<00:02:17.840> smooth<00:02:18.200> and

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
hand feel a little bit smooth and

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:20.289 
hand feel a little bit smooth and
slippery<00:02:18.739> but<00:02:19.250> it<00:02:19.370> does<00:02:19.519> have<00:02:19.670> that<00:02:19.790> circle

00:02:20.289 --> 00:02:20.299 
slippery but it does have that circle

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:21.819 
slippery but it does have that circle
cut<00:02:20.540> out<00:02:20.660> in<00:02:20.810> the<00:02:20.900> middle<00:02:21.170> so<00:02:21.380> you<00:02:21.470> can<00:02:21.680> get<00:02:21.799> a

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:21.829 
cut out in the middle so you can get a

00:02:21.829 --> 00:02:23.890 
cut out in the middle so you can get a
little<00:02:22.010> grip<00:02:22.280> on<00:02:22.430> that<00:02:22.610> now<00:02:23.510> here<00:02:23.690> you<00:02:23.720> guys

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
little grip on that now here you guys

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.570 
little grip on that now here you guys
can<00:02:24.140> see<00:02:24.170> the<00:02:24.470> design<00:02:24.769> and<00:02:24.920> you<00:02:25.010> can<00:02:25.130> tell<00:02:25.370> why

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
can see the design and you can tell why

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.160 
can see the design and you can tell why
it's<00:02:25.790> called<00:02:26.000> numbers<00:02:26.420> and<00:02:26.599> in<00:02:26.690> between<00:02:26.810> each

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
it's called numbers and in between each

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:28.360 
it's called numbers and in between each
number<00:02:27.560> has<00:02:27.590> an<00:02:27.860> another

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
number has an another

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.160 
number has an another
I slow<00:02:28.610> design<00:02:28.940> in<00:02:29.060> there<00:02:29.180> now<00:02:29.629> the<00:02:29.690> apple

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
I slow design in there now the apple

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:31.809 
I slow design in there now the apple
logo<00:02:30.200> is<00:02:30.620> showing<00:02:31.129> and<00:02:31.250> if<00:02:31.310> you<00:02:31.400> guys<00:02:31.580> have<00:02:31.790> a

00:02:31.809 --> 00:02:31.819 
logo is showing and if you guys have a

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:33.670 
logo is showing and if you guys have a
problem<00:02:32.090> with<00:02:32.450> that<00:02:32.480> what<00:02:32.840> you<00:02:32.959> can<00:02:33.140> do<00:02:33.290> is<00:02:33.530> you

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
problem with that what you can do is you

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.289 
problem with that what you can do is you
can<00:02:33.709> get<00:02:34.040> a<00:02:34.069> normal<00:02:34.459> screen<00:02:34.640> shield<00:02:34.909> and<00:02:35.120> cut

00:02:35.289 --> 00:02:35.299 
can get a normal screen shield and cut

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:37.270 
can get a normal screen shield and cut
out<00:02:35.420> a<00:02:35.450> little<00:02:35.750> square<00:02:36.260> or<00:02:36.470> a<00:02:36.500> circle<00:02:36.950> to<00:02:37.069> cut

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
out a little square or a circle to cut

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.309 
out a little square or a circle to cut
around<00:02:37.400> it<00:02:37.670> paste<00:02:38.269> that<00:02:38.480> on<00:02:38.690> and<00:02:38.930> then<00:02:39.049> put<00:02:39.080> on

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:39.319 
around it paste that on and then put on

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:40.869 
around it paste that on and then put on
the<00:02:39.470> case<00:02:39.650> let's<00:02:40.280> go<00:02:40.370> ahead<00:02:40.430> and<00:02:40.519> take<00:02:40.610> this

00:02:40.869 --> 00:02:40.879 
the case let's go ahead and take this

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:43.030 
the case let's go ahead and take this
case<00:02:41.120> off<00:02:41.330> and<00:02:41.599> jump<00:02:42.290> into<00:02:42.409> our<00:02:42.530> next<00:02:42.680> case<00:02:42.890> so

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
case off and jump into our next case so

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:44.170 
case off and jump into our next case so
you<00:02:43.099> can<00:02:43.220> go<00:02:43.280> ahead<00:02:43.370> and<00:02:43.459> grab<00:02:43.700> the<00:02:43.849> sides<00:02:44.030> and

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 
you can go ahead and grab the sides and

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.360 
you can go ahead and grab the sides and
pop<00:02:44.420> it<00:02:44.540> off<00:02:44.629> really<00:02:45.049> easy<00:02:45.319> they<00:02:46.069> come<00:02:46.250> off

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:06.580 
same as the numbers case all the way
around<00:03:04.849> aside<00:03:05.480> from<00:03:05.599> the<00:03:05.780> different<00:03:06.349> design

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
around aside from the different design

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:08.830 
around aside from the different design
really<00:03:07.010> nice<00:03:07.160> design<00:03:07.489> and<00:03:07.730> on<00:03:07.910> the<00:03:08.450> sword<00:03:08.720> it

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
really nice design and on the sword it

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.599 
really nice design and on the sword it
has<00:03:08.989> more<00:03:09.319> little<00:03:09.650> patterns<00:03:10.040> going<00:03:10.280> all<00:03:10.489> the

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:10.609 
has more little patterns going all the

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:13.180 
has more little patterns going all the

way through so that's real nice as the

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:15.280 
way through so that's real nice as the
pattern<00:03:13.609> within<00:03:13.819> the<00:03:14.030> pattern<00:03:14.390> and<00:03:14.569> I<00:03:14.989> guess<00:03:15.170> a

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
pattern within the pattern and I guess a

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:16.630 
pattern within the pattern and I guess a
I<00:03:15.319> totally<00:03:15.739> dig<00:03:15.950> this<00:03:15.980> one<00:03:16.129> this<00:03:16.340> is<00:03:16.400> probably

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:16.640 
I totally dig this one this is probably

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:18.399 
I totally dig this one this is probably
my<00:03:16.790> favorite<00:03:16.819> of<00:03:17.239> the<00:03:17.299> three<00:03:17.450> let's<00:03:18.170> pop<00:03:18.379> it

00:03:18.399 --> 00:03:18.409 
my favorite of the three let's pop it

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:20.229 
my favorite of the three let's pop it
off<00:03:18.590> for<00:03:18.799> now<00:03:18.890> and<00:03:19.099> test<00:03:19.400> out<00:03:19.609> our<00:03:19.640> next<00:03:20.030> case

00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:20.239 
off for now and test out our next case

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:22.479 
off for now and test out our next case
here<00:03:20.930> we<00:03:21.079> have<00:03:21.170> the<00:03:21.319> cross<00:03:21.680> let's<00:03:22.040> pop<00:03:22.250> that<00:03:22.459> on

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:22.489 
here we have the cross let's pop that on

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:24.580 
here we have the cross let's pop that on
and<00:03:22.819> the<00:03:23.209> cross<00:03:23.450> I<00:03:23.690> got<00:03:23.810> to<00:03:23.900> say<00:03:24.019> I<00:03:24.049> like<00:03:24.440> this

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:24.590 
and the cross I got to say I like this

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:26.259 
and the cross I got to say I like this
one<00:03:24.650> it<00:03:24.890> has<00:03:25.010> sort<00:03:25.250> of<00:03:25.310> a<00:03:25.400> gun<00:03:25.640> metal<00:03:25.940> type<00:03:26.120> of

00:03:26.259 --> 00:03:26.269 
one it has sort of a gun metal type of

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:27.940 
one it has sort of a gun metal type of
finish<00:03:26.450> around<00:03:26.810> it<00:03:27.079> its<00:03:27.440> toes<00:03:27.650> the<00:03:27.769> same

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:27.950 
finish around it its toes the same

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:29.170 
finish around it its toes the same
materials<00:03:28.430> it's<00:03:28.640> made<00:03:28.700> from<00:03:28.879> the<00:03:29.030> same

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:29.180 
materials it's made from the same

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:31.059 
materials it's made from the same
material<00:03:29.569> has<00:03:29.690> the<00:03:29.810> soft<00:03:30.049> matte<00:03:30.290> finish<00:03:30.680> but

00:03:31.059 --> 00:03:31.069 
material has the soft matte finish but

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:33.039 
material has the soft matte finish but
it<00:03:31.190> has<00:03:31.310> that<00:03:31.519> gunmetal<00:03:31.940> look<00:03:32.269> and<00:03:32.480> check<00:03:32.510> out

00:03:33.039 --> 00:03:33.049 
it has that gunmetal look and check out

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:35.440 
it has that gunmetal look and check out
that<00:03:33.230> design<00:03:33.590> all<00:03:34.220> the<00:03:34.519> way<00:03:34.639> up<00:03:34.760> really<00:03:35.299> really

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:35.450 
that design all the way up really really

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:37.960 
that design all the way up really really
nice<00:03:35.660> as<00:03:35.900> pattern<00:03:36.410> within<00:03:36.590> pattern<00:03:37.190> I<00:03:37.370> got<00:03:37.880> to

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:37.970 
nice as pattern within pattern I got to

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:39.309 
nice as pattern within pattern I got to
say<00:03:38.060> they<00:03:38.209> did<00:03:38.359> a<00:03:38.389> great<00:03:38.660> job<00:03:38.690> with<00:03:38.989> these

00:03:39.309 --> 00:03:39.319 
say they did a great job with these

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:41.860 
say they did a great job with these
cases<00:03:39.799> now<00:03:40.669> let's<00:03:40.819> go<00:03:40.940> ahead<00:03:41.030> and<00:03:41.120> set<00:03:41.660> down

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:41.870 
cases now let's go ahead and set down

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:44.500 
cases now let's go ahead and set down
the<00:03:41.930> cases<00:03:42.859> nice<00:03:43.099> and<00:03:43.310> organized<00:03:43.639> now<00:03:44.209> one

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:44.510 
the cases nice and organized now one

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:46.300 
the cases nice and organized now one
thing<00:03:44.540> about<00:03:44.989> these<00:03:45.260> since<00:03:45.590> they<00:03:45.709> are<00:03:45.799> snap<00:03:46.129> on

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:46.310 
thing about these since they are snap on

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:47.949 
thing about these since they are snap on
cases<00:03:46.579> is<00:03:46.879> that<00:03:47.120> they<00:03:47.239> don't<00:03:47.419> offer<00:03:47.629> much

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:47.959 
cases is that they don't offer much

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:49.809 
cases is that they don't offer much
protection<00:03:48.069> seeing<00:03:49.069> as<00:03:49.190> they're<00:03:49.519> lightweight

00:03:49.809 --> 00:03:49.819 
protection seeing as they're lightweight

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:51.699 
protection seeing as they're lightweight
and<00:03:50.299> they're<00:03:50.450> very<00:03:50.480> slim<00:03:50.989> if<00:03:51.200> you<00:03:51.319> drop<00:03:51.560> them

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:51.709 
and they're very slim if you drop them

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:52.900 
and they're very slim if you drop them
you're<00:03:52.190> probably<00:03:52.340> going<00:03:52.519> to<00:03:52.579> get<00:03:52.669> a<00:03:52.730> little

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:52.910 
you're probably going to get a little

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:54.430 
you're probably going to get a little
bit<00:03:53.090> of<00:03:53.120> damage<00:03:53.389> to<00:03:53.750> your<00:03:53.840> phone<00:03:54.019> or<00:03:54.200> probably

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:54.440 
bit of damage to your phone or probably

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:55.659 
bit of damage to your phone or probably
a<00:03:54.470> lot<00:03:54.650> of<00:03:54.739> damage<00:03:54.919> depending<00:03:55.190> on<00:03:55.370> how<00:03:55.459> high

00:03:55.659 --> 00:03:55.669 
a lot of damage depending on how high

00:03:55.669 --> 00:03:57.490 
a lot of damage depending on how high
the<00:03:55.730> drop<00:03:56.060> is<00:03:56.239> so<00:03:56.720> you're<00:03:56.989> not<00:03:57.109> going<00:03:57.319> to<00:03:57.410> want

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:57.500 
the drop is so you're not going to want

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:58.629 
the drop is so you're not going to want
to<00:03:57.650> drop<00:03:57.799> these<00:03:57.980> but<00:03:58.160> that's<00:03:58.310> not<00:03:58.459> what

00:03:58.629 --> 00:03:58.639 
to drop these but that's not what

00:03:58.639 --> 00:04:00.159 
to drop these but that's not what
they're<00:03:58.760> made<00:03:58.910> for<00:03:58.940> now<00:03:59.599> another<00:03:59.810> thing<00:03:59.930> they

00:04:00.159 --> 00:04:00.169 
they're made for now another thing they

00:04:00.169 --> 00:04:01.479 
they're made for now another thing they
usually<00:04:00.440> don't<00:04:00.560> have<00:04:00.769> is<00:04:00.980> lay<00:04:01.250> on<00:04:01.310> the<00:04:01.459> table

00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:01.489 
usually don't have is lay on the table

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:03.640 
usually don't have is lay on the table
design<00:04:01.910> you<00:04:02.090> see<00:04:02.239> that<00:04:02.419> these<00:04:02.629> hardly<00:04:03.440> cover

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:03.650 
design you see that these hardly cover

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:05.470 
design you see that these hardly cover
the<00:04:03.799> chrome<00:04:04.010> they<00:04:04.160> don't<00:04:04.310> cover<00:04:04.519> it<00:04:04.639> much<00:04:04.879> so

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:05.480 
the chrome they don't cover it much so

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:06.550 
the chrome they don't cover it much so
you're<00:04:05.750> not<00:04:05.810> going<00:04:05.930> to<00:04:06.019> have<00:04:06.109> that<00:04:06.169> lay<00:04:06.379> on<00:04:06.500> the

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:06.560 
you're not going to have that lay on the

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:08.619 
you're not going to have that lay on the
table<00:04:06.590> design<00:04:07.160> so<00:04:08.000> you<00:04:08.090> won't<00:04:08.239> be<00:04:08.299> able<00:04:08.359> to<00:04:08.480> lay

00:04:08.619 --> 00:04:08.629 
table design so you won't be able to lay

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:10.539 
table design so you won't be able to lay
your<00:04:08.780> phone<00:04:09.019> on<00:04:09.230> the<00:04:09.349> table<00:04:09.379> but<00:04:10.250> really

your phone on the table but really

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:11.890 
your phone on the table but really
that's<00:04:10.669> not<00:04:10.940> what<00:04:11.090> they're<00:04:11.209> meant<00:04:11.329> for<00:04:11.449> these

that's not what they're meant for these

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:13.990 
that's not what they're meant for these
cases<00:04:12.440> are<00:04:12.590> meant<00:04:12.799> for<00:04:12.980> style<00:04:13.250> these<00:04:13.549> cases

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:15.620 
are meant for that design that they have

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:18.129 
are meant for that design that they have
on<00:04:15.769> the<00:04:15.859> back<00:04:16.039> and<00:04:16.419> also<00:04:17.419> for<00:04:17.750> people<00:04:17.810> who

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:20.750 
don't like big bulky cases slim fitting

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:23.350 
don't like big bulky cases slim fitting
cases<00:04:21.169> are<00:04:21.380> nice<00:04:21.620> way<00:04:21.829> to<00:04:21.919> go<00:04:22.099> so<00:04:22.729> overall<00:04:23.180> guys

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:23.360 
cases are nice way to go so overall guys

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.360 
cases are nice way to go so overall guys
I<00:04:23.599> definitely<00:04:23.960> would<00:04:24.500> recommend<00:04:24.530> these<00:04:24.979> cases

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:25.370 
I definitely would recommend these cases

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:27.430 
I definitely would recommend these cases
I'm<00:04:25.550> not<00:04:25.789> too<00:04:26.000> big<00:04:26.210> of<00:04:26.240> a<00:04:26.449> you<00:04:26.900> know<00:04:26.990> snap<00:04:27.260> on
