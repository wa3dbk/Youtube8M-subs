00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:07.990
 the history 

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:14.500
 on this occasion 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.240
 so we present has pierced in the 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.650
 site of the level that we have here as 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.410
 rommedhal 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:28.279
 it's about three devices the family 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:32.460
 it is formed by three devices 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:34.170
 of 4 5 and 6 inches all three 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.690
 devices come with a processor 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.480
 intel atom dual core that what 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:42.059
 incorporates the intel processor that is 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:46.800
 the technology that is perfect is to say that 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:51.000
 each core of these devices the 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:53.820
 three come with different colors 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.190
 that also allows the housings to be 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.930
 interchangeable 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.969
 other of the features that 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:03.329
 we present as a novelty is that it is the 

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:06.720
 Interface 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:08.130
 we also present in the last month is 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.770
 our 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.899
 cool it's an interface that we've 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.420
 intended to be very visually very 

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:17.310
 nice with flat icons and that does not 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.830
 affects the navigation and that it is to follow 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:23.010
 being built 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:26.820
 another remarkable point are the different 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:29.200
 modes that incorporate the camera in this 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.570
 case we are talking about 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:34.180
 on a camera in the case of 5 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:36.640
 8-megapixel inches and in the case 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:39.670
 of the 6 inches that is a 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:41.920
 13 negative camera as one of 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:45.090
 the modes with which you can work 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:48.340
 the camera is the low illumination mode 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:50.950
 that what he wants is to be able to do 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:53.590
 photographs in scenes where the 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.360
 lighting is very critical this 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:59.490
 technology is called we have called it 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.490
 master let's try 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:08.940
 inside this box we have a butterfly 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:11.430
 with that there is virtually no light in the 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:14.580
 interior and what we are going to do is with 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:17.270
 the way we have said let's do 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.270
 a photograph 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.620
 this is the result 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:37.540
 for me 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:41.800
 this is the result we get 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:43.870
 also a photograph with technology 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:45.610
 pixel master that if we compare it with 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.500
 another device 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:49.830
 We see that the quality is completely 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.830
 different 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.840
 in fact I want 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:05.940
 another of the functionalities that consumes 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:10.830
 the new decade- year interface is by 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:13.290
 example what's next is a manager of 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:16.080
 tasks is to say what allows you is a 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:18.569
 wit in the same space manage 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:20.849
 both your email accounts and 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:23.849
 calls synchronize it with the calendar 

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:27.000
 so that at a single glance you can see 

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:31.340
 what is it that you can see all the 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.340
 tasks that you have for this day moment
