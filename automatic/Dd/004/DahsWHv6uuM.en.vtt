chicken<00:01:04.980> in<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.190> bowl<00:01:05.370> so<00:01:06.020> the<00:01:07.020> marinade<00:01:07.290> will

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
chicken in the bowl so the marinade will

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.010 
chicken in the bowl so the marinade will
just<00:01:07.920> discard<00:01:08.250> it<00:01:08.430> set<00:01:08.790> this<00:01:08.880> aside<00:01:09.030> then

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
just discard it set this aside then

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.540 
just discard it set this aside then
we'll<00:01:10.170> make<00:01:10.350> the<00:01:10.380> batter<00:01:10.680> okay<00:01:11.190> for<00:01:11.400> the

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:11.550 
we'll make the batter okay for the

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:14.360 
we'll make the batter okay for the
batter<00:01:11.730> simply<00:01:12.450> add<00:01:12.600> the<00:01:12.810> eggs<00:01:13.100> that<00:01:14.100> has<00:01:14.220> been

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:14.370 
batter simply add the eggs that has been

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:19.750 
batter simply add the eggs that has been
beat<00:01:14.520> in<00:01:14.930> the<00:01:15.930> oil<00:01:16.580> some<00:01:17.580> fresh<00:01:17.610> milk<00:01:18.060> and

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:19.760 
beat in the oil some fresh milk and

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:23.330 
beat in the oil some fresh milk and
using<00:01:20.760> a<00:01:20.850> whisk<00:01:21.060> slowly<00:01:21.960> add<00:01:22.230> the<00:01:22.650> all-purpose

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
using a whisk slowly add the all-purpose

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.820 
using a whisk slowly add the all-purpose
flour<00:01:26.270> so<00:01:27.270> the<00:01:27.300> reason<00:01:27.720> why<00:01:27.870> we<00:01:28.440> slowly<00:01:28.710> add

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:28.830 
flour so the reason why we slowly add

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:31.070 
flour so the reason why we slowly add
the<00:01:29.190> all-purpose<00:01:29.730> flour<00:01:30.030> in<00:01:30.270> the<00:01:30.390> bowl<00:01:30.420> is<00:01:30.810> to

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:31.080 
the all-purpose flour in the bowl is to

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:32.960 
the all-purpose flour in the bowl is to
prevent<00:01:31.410> the<00:01:31.740> mixture<00:01:32.160> from<00:01:32.310> having<00:01:32.640> lumps

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
prevent the mixture from having lumps

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.250 
prevent the mixture from having lumps
okay<00:01:35.330> so<00:01:36.330> the<00:01:36.450> batter<00:01:36.630> should<00:01:36.870> be<00:01:36.960> really

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:37.260 
okay so the batter should be really

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.100 
okay so the batter should be really
really<00:01:37.620> smooth<00:01:38.310> and<00:01:38.580> that's<00:01:39.420> it<00:01:39.540> our<00:01:39.690> batter

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
really smooth and that's it our batter

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.710 
really smooth and that's it our batter
is<00:01:40.320> set<00:01:40.530> so<00:01:41.130> we'll<00:01:41.250> set<00:01:41.370> this<00:01:41.460> aside<00:01:41.720> then

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
is set so we'll set this aside then

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.420 
is set so we'll set this aside then
we'll<00:01:42.900> go<00:01:43.020> for<00:01:43.170> the<00:01:43.230> coating<00:01:43.440> now<00:01:43.920> the<00:01:43.980> code<00:01:44.250> is

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
we'll go for the coating now the code is

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.910 
we'll go for the coating now the code is
basically<00:01:45.000> easy<00:01:45.200> all<00:01:46.200> you<00:01:46.260> have<00:01:46.500> to<00:01:46.710> do<00:01:46.800> is

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
basically easy all you have to do is

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.770 
basically easy all you have to do is
simply<00:01:47.190> mix<00:01:47.460> the<00:01:47.670> all-purpose<00:01:48.120> flour<00:01:48.270> and<00:01:48.600> the

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
simply mix the all-purpose flour and the

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.140 
simply mix the all-purpose flour and the
ground<00:01:48.990> black<00:01:49.170> pepper<00:01:49.700> so<00:01:50.700> mix<00:01:50.910> it<00:01:51.000> all

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:51.150 
ground black pepper so mix it all

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:53.180 
ground black pepper so mix it all
together<00:01:51.270> with<00:01:51.510> a<00:01:51.630> fork<00:01:51.690> and<00:01:52.110> we're<00:01:52.710> done<00:01:52.860> so

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:53.190 
together with a fork and we're done so

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:54.530 
together with a fork and we're done so
here's<00:01:53.820> the<00:01:53.970> tricky<00:01:54.270> part

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
here's the tricky part

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.110 
here's the tricky part
so<00:01:55.260> for<00:01:55.470> breading<00:01:55.860> we<00:01:56.370> need<00:01:56.520> to<00:01:56.640> coat<00:01:56.820> first

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:57.120 
so for breading we need to coat first

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:00.110 
so for breading we need to coat first
the<00:01:57.360> chicken<00:01:57.660> pieces<00:01:57.810> into<00:01:58.740> the<00:01:58.980> coating<00:01:59.400> then

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:00.120 
the chicken pieces into the coating then

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:01.970 
the chicken pieces into the coating then
after<00:02:00.450> that<00:02:00.600> we<00:02:00.750> dip<00:02:00.900> it<00:02:01.020> in<00:02:01.170> batter<00:02:01.320> then<00:02:01.830> we

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:01.980 
after that we dip it in batter then we

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:03.980 
after that we dip it in batter then we
deep-fry<00:02:02.160> them<00:02:02.490> so<00:02:03.090> we'll<00:02:03.210> coat<00:02:03.420> one<00:02:03.690> piece<00:02:03.870> of

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
deep-fry them so we'll coat one piece of

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.700 
deep-fry them so we'll coat one piece of
the<00:02:04.050> chicken<00:02:04.310> make<00:02:05.310> sure<00:02:05.460> you<00:02:05.610> coat<00:02:05.790> all<00:02:06.060> sides
