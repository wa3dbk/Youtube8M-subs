00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 Hello Dear Friends, I'm with you I 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.589
 and I want to show how to install the game 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:10.530
 android lego star wars gamaz with cache 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:13.590
 now April 29 is shorter than update 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:16.740
 the fact that lego star wars voices came out already 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:19.050
 officially hurry and before that in winter when 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.480
 for the first time a current tone came out just 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.930
 on android she was without cache while weighed 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:27.570
 dick and 5 megabits as I remember and it was 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.699
 install the game damn problematic and all 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.850
 wrote something that fix this problem and 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:35.790
 after all this corrected notes and what is it 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.969
 all lead and now i'm sitting on y tube like 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:42.239
 usually look seen not here writes one of 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:45.809
 Subscribers to what I installed the game 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:48.450
 for now how did you show well after 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:51.899
 how do i let her play with me black 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:55.079
 the screen and everything I thought for five minutes and decided 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:58.020
 go here to this site where we just 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:01.230
 downloaded before and went in and saw here 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:04.470
 then of course I added now I caught up 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.299
 right away because like i'm a professional i 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.549
 This has long been doing this 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:12.210
 the fact that the game without the cache will not work 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:15.360
 here it is clear the stump and I decided right now 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.390
 already officially shoot everything specifically 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.200
 yes by the way in the old video reference 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:23.460
 leave on this video 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:26.850
 we download and for now as usual ours with you 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:29.189
 here is dead yet for now to choose files 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:33.020
 I have chosen the very first to my taste and 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:35.280
 choose this one of course here it is 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:38.549
 also download it I will not risk 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.140
 torrent because how can I not 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.810
 then not all 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:45.570
 and wait until we have everything with you and now we have 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:48.270
 you downloaded quickly enough so 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:51.500
 what let's turn back now 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:55.259
 we go to our computer with you 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:58.290
 devices so here so then we 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:00.270
 we go again my computer and where we 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.909
 all with you downloaded that I have standard 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:05.700

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.150
 read and if im down my up 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.110
 more precisely 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:19.840
 look for the folder android folder shoe and after 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:21.930
 this we develop archiver and just 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:25.060
 there this daddy is like this 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:29.080
 dragging starts here 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:33.190
 copy crash weighs a lot 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:36.489
 barely a plus more just weighed there 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:38.110

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:49.120
 developers hope everything will work 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:52.420
 now on such phones which 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:57.340
 RAM somewhere somewhere probably 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:03:00.099
 decade or two giga because this game 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:02.769
 very much populated the memory as I have 

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:07.000
 he said well and we can only 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:08.680
 wait until we have everything with you and now we have 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.530
 all with you perry copied let's 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:14.079
 repeat the way my computer is with you 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:16.209
 devices while android folder and woman and 

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:18.700

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:21.340
 it must be a file 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:23.139
 be both used but now we start ours with you 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:25.389
 installations we switched to ours with you 

00:03:23.139 --> 00:03:30.040
 devices let's go to the dispatcher 

00:03:25.389 --> 00:03:33.970
 files that you have walk after 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:40.569
 computer now we go where we threw 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:43.440

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:54.670
 Minute can not hands 2 maximum I do not know 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:57.040
 depending on the power of your 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:04:01.810
 devices push ready to run 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:04.319
 I won't play now because you play 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:07.030
 the camera will take off because she 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:09.340
 designed for games I have it 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:11.829
 intended only for the screen itself 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:15.569
