 I believe there is need 

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:28.690
 you need to unpack file office 2011 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:32.890

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:36.610
 file 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:40.000
 you must open the folder and copy or 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:42.940
 better to drag this file 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:46.810
 minecraft rochus punto ai c.le sizing 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:51.520
 point playlist we occupy it inside 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:55.960
 of the folder we do authentic e 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:57.730
 let's replace here put the 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:00.340
 password 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:05.290
 and once we have the password we can 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:07.180
 close the folder and return to the top 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:08.110
 file here that we opened earlier 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:11.350
 precisely of mg 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:15.280
 after which we open to file office 2011 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:19.510
 than the one with below and we click on 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:21.880

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:25.570

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:34.480

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:46.300
 now it was n't because if I already have it

 I show it will not ask you to my parents 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:49.390
 in the serials nothing of the kind 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:54.550
 because we have already entered the license 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:57.100
 first when you open it for the first 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:57.940
 time will ask you as usual with i 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:00.910
 office programs 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:04.150
 if you want to participate in the usual 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:05.530
 help program in the case of problems 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:07.780
 send emails so on 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:10.900
 Okay I do not I do not even see 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:13.750
 because however there is nothing to know 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:19.270
 because he does it, he can just insert them 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:22.239
 data up until you do it practically then 

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:25.030
 will create the microsoft file 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:26.920
 the microsoft messenger application is 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:28.800
 this is this folder that microsoft 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:31.510
 office 2011 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:34.330
 inside there will be Excel powerpoint 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:36.250
 word and outlook 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:39.970
 in addition this that microsoft document 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:42.130
 connection that I wouldn't know well what it is 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:46.720
 but I mention the use for that 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:50.920
 so I can't tell you what it is anyway 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:54.520
 no programs are working I don't know 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:57.520
 for example we will know excel we go a 

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:59.800
 moment of time to load up like 

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:03.070
 you can see microsoft excel here 

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:05.470
 mac 2011 which it will update 

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:07.750
 of the menu for the first time per kilo 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:09.760
 for the first time it updates the 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:17.230
 bio xl the first time I open it then 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:19.239
 he scans me and nothing doesn't 

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:21.370
 will absolutely ask for any serial 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:23.110
 well more than anywhere else it will show 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:25.720
 because entering the license is as if 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:27.490
 you have already entered the serial number and will make you 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:30.070
 see the serial you entered then 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:34.690
 you don't have to do anything else but one 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:37.510
 once you have entered it will be enough to do on a new file 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:41.560
 so on otherwise click on these 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:43.150
 to create a new one as it could like 

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:45.760
 you can see the various models here 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:48.690
 which you can insert there are those already 

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:52.210
 facts or in any case an empty one 

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:54.220
 here is for when the network will ask pri 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:57.730
 also to update it in case there is 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:05:00.360
 are nothing just do automatic e 

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:03.040
 every every week whenever 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:04.600
 set here he will make you 

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:06.550
 update automatically e 

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:08.500
 obviously you won't have to enter another one 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:13.630
 serial is because it's like prestige 

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:14.280
 bought so it's all and everything already a 

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:18.280
 place 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:21.220
 oh well let's create a swimming model and how 

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:23.560
 you can see here are and how swindon 

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:25.560
 only that we have it on mac 

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:30.070
 after the tools are the same 

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:31.630
 I change the graphics for a moment, however 

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:34.330
 tools are always the ones that capture them 

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:38.280
 they will then be used for 

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:38.280
 this video is all hi everyone
