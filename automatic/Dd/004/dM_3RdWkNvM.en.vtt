Grizzles out there that can use the

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.240

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:20.320 
I think if you pull off a lot of head

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:22.380 
I think if you pull off a lot of head
shots<00:02:20.620> like<00:02:21.250> you<00:02:21.400> can<00:02:21.520> do<00:02:21.640> one<00:02:21.850> shot<00:02:22.120> kills

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
shots like you can do one shot kills

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.900 
shots like you can do one shot kills
with<00:02:22.600> headshots<00:02:23.020> but<00:02:23.400> it's<00:02:24.400> just<00:02:24.610> I<00:02:24.850> don't

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:49.110 
and knifing them that would be a lot
easier<00:03:47.410> than<00:03:47.800> trying<00:03:48.310> to<00:03:48.490> kill<00:03:48.670> someone<00:03:48.880> with

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:49.120 
easier than trying to kill someone with

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:51.990 
easier than trying to kill someone with
us<00:03:49.270> in<00:03:49.540> 1911<00:03:49.900> because<00:03:50.800> you'll<00:03:51.310> start<00:03:51.550> shooting

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:52.000 
us in 1911 because you'll start shooting

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.400 
us in 1911 because you'll start shooting
at<00:03:52.120> them<00:03:52.270> and<00:03:52.450> they're<00:03:52.780> just<00:03:52.810> getting<00:03:53.140> hit

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:53.410

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:55.860 
at them and they're just getting hit
markers<00:03:53.800> so<00:03:53.980> they're<00:03:54.100> like<00:03:54.250> hey<00:03:54.870> somebody's

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:55.870 
markers so they're like hey somebody's

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:10.390 
from Oz and yeah I did not have fun

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:12.060 
from Oz and yeah I did not have fun
playing<00:04:10.840> with<00:04:10.930> this<00:04:11.080> weapon<00:04:11.320> I<00:04:11.620> probably

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:12.070 
playing with this weapon I probably

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:16.080 
playing with this weapon I probably
played<00:04:12.310> I<00:04:13.110> don't<00:04:14.110> know<00:04:14.230> an<00:04:14.860> hour<00:04:15.220> or<00:04:15.850> two

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:16.090 
played I don't know an hour or two

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:19.199 
played I don't know an hour or two
trying<00:04:16.690> to<00:04:16.750> win<00:04:16.870> a<00:04:16.900> free-for-all<00:04:17.410> and<00:04:18.209> second

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:19.209 
trying to win a free-for-all and second

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:21.150 
trying to win a free-for-all and second
place<00:04:19.480> was<00:04:19.960> the<00:04:20.080> best<00:04:20.260> that<00:04:20.470> I<00:04:20.530> could<00:04:20.710> get<00:04:20.859> and

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:21.160 
place was the best that I could get and

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:22.710 
place was the best that I could get and
that<00:04:21.370> was<00:04:21.520> this<00:04:21.669> game<00:04:21.910> right<00:04:22.120> here<00:04:22.419> and<00:04:22.660> I

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:22.720 
that was this game right here and I

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.240 
that was this game right here and I
think<00:04:22.960> one<00:04:23.169> of<00:04:23.260> the<00:04:23.320> only<00:04:23.500> reasons<00:04:23.740> that<00:04:24.040> I<00:04:24.160> was

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:24.250 
think one of the only reasons that I was

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:25.030 
think one of the only reasons that I was
even<00:04:24.490> able<00:04:24.580> to<00:04:24.729> get

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:25.040 
even able to get

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:27.820 
even able to get
second<00:04:25.280> place<00:04:25.490> is<00:04:25.820> because<00:04:26.780> I'm<00:04:27.140> playing<00:04:27.620> with

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:27.830 
second place is because I'm playing with

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:29.880 
second place is because I'm playing with
a<00:04:27.860> lot<00:04:28.070> of<00:04:28.450> soft-headed

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:29.890 
a lot of soft-headed

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:34.150 
a lot of soft-headed
short<00:04:30.890> bus<00:04:31.100> riders<00:04:31.550> like<00:04:32.030> these<00:04:32.510> guys<00:04:33.160> so

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:34.160 
short bus riders like these guys so

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:37.150 
short bus riders like these guys so
we're<00:04:34.280> sitting<00:04:34.520> back<00:04:34.850> at<00:04:35.060> the<00:04:35.150> corner<00:04:35.540> and<00:04:36.350> I

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:37.160 
we're sitting back at the corner and I

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:38.380 
we're sitting back at the corner and I
don't<00:04:37.220> know<00:04:37.430> what<00:04:37.670> they're<00:04:37.850> doing<00:04:38.240> I<00:04:38.360> think

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:38.390 
don't know what they're doing I think

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:40.870 
don't know what they're doing I think
they're<00:04:38.720> like<00:04:38.900> trying<00:04:39.140> to<00:04:39.260> practice<00:04:39.950> sniping

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:40.880 
they're like trying to practice sniping

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:44.920

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:44.930 
or something and they were bad so that's

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:46.870
