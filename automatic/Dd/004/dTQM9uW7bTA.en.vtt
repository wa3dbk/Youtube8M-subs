00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:37.180 
things that are sort of more conceptual

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:39.450 
things that are sort of more conceptual
you<00:01:37.600> know<00:01:37.720> taking<00:01:38.230> a<00:01:38.410> flower<00:01:38.680> inspiration<00:01:39.310> and

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:39.460 
you know taking a flower inspiration and

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:42.330 
you know taking a flower inspiration and
really<00:01:39.700> sort<00:01:39.940> of<00:01:40.000> developing<00:01:40.450> it<00:01:40.570> in<00:01:40.660> a<00:01:40.720> 3d<00:01:41.340> way

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:42.340 
really sort of developing it in a 3d way

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:44.760 
really sort of developing it in a 3d way
but<00:01:42.760> this<00:01:42.880> one<00:01:43.150> I<00:01:43.180> think<00:01:43.360> that<00:01:43.750> I<00:01:43.990> was<00:01:44.470> sort<00:01:44.710> of

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:44.770 
but this one I think that I was sort of
