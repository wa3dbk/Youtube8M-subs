sure<00:00:39.750> my<00:00:39.899> third<00:00:40.079> Burke<00:00:40.290> is<00:00:40.500> most<00:00:41.219> likely

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
sure my third Burke is most likely

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.779 
sure my third Burke is most likely
either<00:00:41.730> study<00:00:42.180> a<00:00:42.329> more<00:00:42.570> ninja<00:00:43.520> not<00:00:44.520> really<00:00:44.700> why

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
either study a more ninja not really why

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.420 
either study a more ninja not really why
sure<00:00:45.000> but<00:00:45.719> I've<00:00:45.899> got<00:00:46.079> a<00:00:46.110> single<00:00:46.530> USP<00:00:47.219> is<00:00:47.280> my

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
sure but I've got a single USP is my

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.130 
sure but I've got a single USP is my
secondary<00:00:47.850> and<00:00:48.090> I<00:00:48.120> think<00:00:48.270> it<00:00:48.329> is<00:00:48.450> FMJ<00:00:48.989> or

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
secondary and I think it is FMJ or

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.779 
secondary and I think it is FMJ or
something<00:00:49.530> i<00:00:49.710> don't<00:00:49.770> think<00:00:50.039> it's<00:00:50.219> silence<00:00:50.640> if

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
something i don't think it's silence if

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.510 
something i don't think it's silence if
i<00:00:50.879> remember<00:00:51.090> correctly<00:00:51.739> and<00:00:52.739> I'm<00:00:53.100> running<00:00:53.309> the
