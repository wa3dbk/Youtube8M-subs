00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
have you guys do is called reverse blast

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:31.730 
have you guys do is called reverse blast
you<00:01:30.630> guys<00:01:30.810> have<00:01:30.930> probably<00:01:31.049> seen<00:01:31.380> this<00:01:31.530> before

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
you guys have probably seen this before

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.649 
you guys have probably seen this before
and<00:01:32.250> you<00:01:32.610> can<00:01:32.759> do<00:01:32.850> this<00:01:33.000> with<00:01:33.060> lighter<00:01:33.450> weights

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
and you can do this with lighter weights

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.630 
and you can do this with lighter weights
or<00:01:34.020> heavier<00:01:34.350> weights<00:01:34.650> really<00:01:34.829> depends<00:01:35.310> on<00:01:35.430> you

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
or heavier weights really depends on you

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.700 
or heavier weights really depends on you
when<00:01:36.630> you<00:01:36.720> do<00:01:36.869> this<00:01:37.020> one<00:01:37.229> make<00:01:37.380> sure<00:01:37.409> you<00:01:37.590> keep

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
when you do this one make sure you keep

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950 
when you get to the bottom make sure you

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.309 
when you get to the bottom make sure you
pause<00:01:58.250> don't<00:01:58.700> use<00:01:58.880> momentum<00:01:59.149> to<00:02:00.049> get<00:02:00.140> the

00:02:00.309 --> 00:02:00.319 
pause don't use momentum to get the

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:02.289 
pause don't use momentum to get the
weights<00:02:00.530> up<00:02:00.740> use<00:02:01.280> all<00:02:01.549> those<00:02:01.670> muscles<00:02:02.119> back

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:02.299 
weights up use all those muscles back

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:04.389 
weights up use all those muscles back
there<00:02:02.569> to<00:02:03.049> swing<00:02:03.319> the<00:02:03.439> weights<00:02:03.619> or<00:02:03.920> pull<00:02:04.310> the

00:02:04.389 --> 00:02:04.399 
there to swing the weights or pull the

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:07.499 
there to swing the weights or pull the
weights<00:02:04.579> up<00:02:04.759> okay<00:02:05.149> so<00:02:05.750> relax<00:02:06.459> pull<00:02:07.459> back

alright next workout right the next one
is<00:02:12.739> going<00:02:13.099> to<00:02:13.220> be<00:02:13.370> for<00:02:13.579> your<00:02:13.640> triceps<00:02:14.239> now<00:02:14.510> with

00:02:14.979 --> 00:02:14.989 
is going to be for your triceps now with

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:17.199 
is going to be for your triceps now with
a<00:02:15.019> lot<00:02:15.260> of<00:02:15.290> these<00:02:15.530> movements<00:02:16.099> there's<00:02:16.610> a<00:02:16.819> good

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:17.209 
a lot of these movements there's a good

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:19.930 
a lot of these movements there's a good
chance<00:02:17.510> of<00:02:17.720> using<00:02:17.900> momentum<00:02:18.200> to<00:02:19.099> get<00:02:19.819> the

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
chance of using momentum to get the

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:21.759 
chance of using momentum to get the
weights<00:02:20.150> up<00:02:20.360> so<00:02:20.660> what<00:02:21.170> you<00:02:21.260> want<00:02:21.440> to<00:02:21.530> do<00:02:21.620> is

00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:21.769 
weights up so what you want to do is

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:23.440 
weights up so what you want to do is
kind<00:02:21.980> of<00:02:22.130> to<00:02:22.280> limit<00:02:22.610> that<00:02:22.760> possibility<00:02:23.239> of

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
kind of to limit that possibility of

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.180 
kind of to limit that possibility of
using<00:02:23.569> momentum<00:02:23.840> and<00:02:24.440> getting<00:02:24.799> the<00:02:24.890> most<00:02:25.040> out

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
using momentum and getting the most out

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:26.920 
using momentum and getting the most out
of<00:02:25.250> your<00:02:25.430> workout<00:02:25.489> you<00:02:26.420> may<00:02:26.540> want<00:02:26.750> to<00:02:26.780> make

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
of your workout you may want to make

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.740 
of your workout you may want to make
sure<00:02:26.959> you<00:02:27.230> pause<00:02:27.620> between<00:02:28.579> each<00:02:28.970> positions

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
sure you pause between each positions

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.330 
sure you pause between each positions
that<00:02:30.019> way<00:02:30.260> you're<00:02:30.530> actually<00:02:30.739> using<00:02:30.950> the

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
that way you're actually using the

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.160 
that way you're actually using the
muscles<00:02:31.579> to<00:02:31.880> move<00:02:32.060> the<00:02:32.360> weights<00:02:32.540> rather<00:02:32.900> than

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
muscles to move the weights rather than

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:35.740 
muscles to move the weights rather than
momentum<00:02:33.739> or<00:02:34.099> gravity<00:02:34.549> okay<00:02:35.060> so<00:02:35.480> let's<00:02:35.660> get

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
momentum or gravity okay so let's get

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:40.059 
momentum or gravity okay so let's get
started<00:02:35.870> first<00:02:37.930> what<00:02:38.930> we're<00:02:39.769> going<00:02:39.860> to<00:02:39.950> put

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:03.400 
reps of these once you get to 10 here's
a<00:03:01.670> fun<00:03:01.880> part<00:03:02.209> you're<00:03:02.720> going<00:03:02.900> to<00:03:02.989> do<00:03:03.079> ten<00:03:03.260> of

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:03.410 
a fun part you're going to do ten of

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:08.770 
a fun part you're going to do ten of
these<00:03:05.920> notice<00:03:06.920> their<00:03:07.100> own<00:03:07.220> lot<00:03:07.430> smaller<00:03:07.849> and<00:03:08.239> I

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:08.780 
these notice their own lot smaller and I

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:10.539 
these notice their own lot smaller and I
tend<00:03:09.019> to<00:03:09.139> hold<00:03:09.410> it<00:03:09.620> back<00:03:09.769> there<00:03:10.069> a<00:03:10.099> little<00:03:10.190> bit

00:03:10.539 --> 00:03:10.549 
tend to hold it back there a little bit

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:13.390
