00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 hi this is the video site team 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:06.420
 test.com today I present to you the 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:09.210
 aig test two proteins in nutri 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.610
 muscles so obviously we see here the 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.650
 version 2 1 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:15.150
 these are egg whites then at 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.710
 level of commercial arguments put into 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.350
 before by the brand that does not really 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.210
 strictly speaking let's say it is 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.800
 noted no chemical manipulation that 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.019
 can be used in cooking and 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:29.810
 presence of probiotics and prebiotics 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.810
 and so we wanted to avoid that 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:42.730
 so high level so ingredients 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.950
 well, it's pretty simple inside 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:46.930
 so you have eggs that come 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:48.940
 a breeding of hens raised in full 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:51.730
 air so we could say that's the 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:54.600
 category u are not organic eggs 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:57.699
 which are a bit more expensive 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:00.190
 so here are obviously pasteurized 

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:02.019
 and not instant read so that wants 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:05.050
 say without soy lecithin so that 

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:08.020
 without risk of having gmc water 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:09.340
 intolerance it pretty much reduced and the 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:12.009
 presence of aromas because you can 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:14.080
 obviously find so chocolate aromas 

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:17.020
 or vanilla and the presence of 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:18.610
 prebiotics and probiotics that 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.820
 hoped explained it's a little bit 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:22.780
 thereafter 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.450
 you also have the presence and the 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:27.759
 Quran is actually sucralose duration 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.149
 sucralose that we have already tested on our 

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:30.250
 site 

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:31.780
 at the level of cons- 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:35.009
 note that per 100 grams of powder 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:37.840
 you go about 80 g of protein 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.729
 daf grams of carbohydrates and almost no 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:42.280
 So the EPIDe there that's interesting 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:43.869
 so we have a protein dosed at 80% and 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.300
 again here I am in the chocolate scent 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:47.890
 so it's a protein that's a 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:48.720
 solution for those who are intolerant 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:52.300
 lactose 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:54.670
 so that's it it's interesting you 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:58.539
 so also have little carbohydrate 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:02:00.580
 so that's the same it's not bad and 0 

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:02.200
 lippi so we could advise this 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:04.060
 product for those who are in front in 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.440
 diet face but maybe not 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:10.330
 necessarily dry because obviously 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:12.190
 even if there how would I say the 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:13.630
 salt content reduced and when to go 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:14.650
 even so it does not get along well with 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:15.310
 those who wish to have a dry 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:16.900
 perfect 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:18.370
 and for those who jump in here for 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.580
 those who wish to control a minimum 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:24.340
 obviously carbohydrates and lipids so 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:26.650
 it's interesting so here the speed 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:29.440
 assimilation of this protein atr se 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.910
 is between cazine and whey so 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:34.030
 it's a speed of the six nations is going 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:36.940
 to say rather moderate slow still that 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.980
 takes into account so we do not have 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.849
 legally prebiotics and the 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.069
 probiotics 

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:43.989
 so basically fast biotic 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:45.430
 definition actually the prebiotics this 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:46.300
 are fibers that promotes the 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:49.210
 beautiful development 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:51.150
 strains of intestinal bacteria and 

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:54.640
 same time added to probiotics 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:56.080
 are bacteria destined to colonize 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.080
 intestines and which therefore allow 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:00.040
 to increase the sum of amino acids 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.790
 and fight against the troubles 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.130
 digestive 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.540
 so obviously the two associated with these 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:07.300
 much more efficient and that's 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:09.090
 interesting on the health level at the 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:11.200
 tips for use 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:13.390
 that's simple they tell you to 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:15.970
 dilute 40 g so that represents little 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:18.580
 near 3 2 is in 25 centilitres of lÃ©o 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:19.900
 of tempered mineral water three times by 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:21.460
 day well bah there three times a day we 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:22.690
 is going to say it's an example it takes 

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:24.310
 use it when it's more convenient 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:26.320
 for you and when you need it 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:27.910
 so what is interesting to note 

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:29.950
 also it is obviously the tribes 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:31.750
 until strongly discourages the use 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:33.820
 of chlorinated water so tap water to 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:35.230
 avoid why because you risk 

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:37.240
 to kill some of the bacteria 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:38.920
 so that would be a bit of a shame 

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:41.470
 argued general I rather advise 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:43.510
 to use bottles water which is 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:45.130
 usually at room temperature and 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:46.540
 this in order to avoid just a few 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:48.850
 small disorders due to the difference of 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:51.550
 temperature you guessed pods that 

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:53.459
 provides graduated dock so that's not it 

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:56.530
 bad it may be not bad too 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:58.420
 and so finally the thesis of mi6 bility 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:09.310
 I put about 250 milliliters 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:11.320
 of water so bottles for to provins 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:13.989
 little idea that's what we mus 

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:16.480
 compared to water but hey it's not 

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:18.459
 not embarrassing and then obviously not rica 

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:20.650
 chemicals within which 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:21.970
 so avoid this phenomenon 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:23.500
 so it's perfectly normal but after 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:25.750
 you have to have a product either wanted a 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:27.669
 pure product or with products 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:30.820
 chemicals and the risks of 

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:32.169
 niger where do I know what inside that 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:33.760
 when you let it rest at that 

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:36.880
 decreases a little bit anyway three 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:39.250
 so I obviously drank the purse 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:41.620
 continues to decrease to but hey the 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:43.750
 cagnois miscibility there is no 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:45.970
 lumps inside I was talking to you at 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:47.470
 my personal opinion now actually 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:49.330
 on two protein proteins 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:52.090
 Egg is famous 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:54.550
 to be very salty that was the versions 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:56.110
 ten years ago that so there 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:59.680
 actually so it's pretty good 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:00.819
 chocolate perfume for me I like to 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:02.949
 both a little aftertaste 

00:05:00.819 --> 00:05:05.830
 possibly a little salty but 

00:05:02.949 --> 00:05:08.409
 it's really very light so it's not 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:09.759
 embarrassment not any digestive trouble no 

00:05:08.409 --> 00:05:12.009
 to take flatulence one counts it either 

00:05:09.759 --> 00:05:13.150
 in any case for me in addition to know 

00:05:12.009 --> 00:05:14.770
 that just inside is from 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:17.949
 present biotic it can not do that 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:20.889
 good to a digestive system that has 

00:05:17.949 --> 00:05:22.569
 not badly needed with everything I test 

00:05:20.889 --> 00:05:24.310
 so what is interesting also 

00:05:22.569 --> 00:05:26.289
 for this protein knows that we can 

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:27.940
 do titles this murderer not 

00:05:26.289 --> 00:05:29.889
 including a small chocolate and has 

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:31.569
 so played will put a very test 

00:05:29.889 --> 00:05:33.370
 soon in the recipes section of 

00:05:31.569 --> 00:05:34.030
 site but you can already find on 

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:36.310
 sites in particular 

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:38.409
 so then the highlights of this 

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:39.490
 product first of all we have a 

00:05:38.409 --> 00:05:41.590
 protein concentration that is 

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:43.120
 correct despite the presence of Roman 

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:44.789
 so that's interesting because we have 

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:46.960
 exceeded 80% 

00:05:44.789 --> 00:05:47.439
 we have sandstone ingredients of 

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:49.389
 quality 

00:05:47.439 --> 00:05:51.789
 you also have no modifications 

00:05:49.389 --> 00:05:54.370
 chemical inside so and finally the 

00:05:51.789 --> 00:05:57.190
 presence of biotic inside that 

00:05:54.370 --> 00:06:00.370
 plays a role in that interesting 60 and of 

00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:02.710
 your digestive system at the level of 

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:05.589
 weak points one could note everything from 

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:07.930
 even the presence of moss so little my 

00:06:05.589 --> 00:06:09.879
 skiing is completely normal when it is 

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:12.339
 explained in the test well it's not 

00:06:09.879 --> 00:06:14.440
 embarrassing to drink but hey that's still 

00:06:12.339 --> 00:06:15.430
 stay still long enough so if 

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:16.599
 you have tips from elsewhere at this 

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:17.229
 so we can I should I 

00:06:16.599 --> 00:06:18.460
 repeat year 

00:06:17.229 --> 00:06:20.620
 do not hesitate to contact us 

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:22.180
 if he could explain to our 

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:24.370
 visitors how to avoid him having this 

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:25.779
 foam one is taker and so I find 

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:27.250
 that it's a good compromise for those who 

00:06:25.779 --> 00:06:28.990
 just want to change type of 

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:30.490
 proteins that want to avoid the 

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:32.620
 milk proteins because they are 

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:35.589
 intolerant to lactose or the 

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:37.750
 beef protein for example that's it 

00:06:35.589 --> 00:06:39.909
 can not value So here bah 

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:41.110
 listen that's all for me I say to 

00:06:39.909 --> 00:06:43.500
 very teen on video test to point like 

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:43.500
 Hi
