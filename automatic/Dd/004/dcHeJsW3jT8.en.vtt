00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:17.340
 all good dear tankman is a film about 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.480
 how I want to tell you today how 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:21.599
 allow your team 

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:24.400
 grab the first second minute 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:25.509
 the base 

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:28.509
 On the map of Prokhorov as a battle 

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:30.809
 for this we need someone 

00:00:30.809 --> 00:00:33.250
 graded quotes 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:34.420
 either something 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:36.489
 such that can sink someone basis 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:38.580
 Hurona Ufa short 

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:41.480
 in time 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:43.510
 I have a great attention 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:45.810
 and we have someone fifth in the middle of the list 

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:47.240
 so we can afford 

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.080
 risky maneuvers 

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:51.230
 because we have little hope 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.180
 for this you need to go to the spa center 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.000
 cards 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.710
 and watch the right flank closely 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.989
 too we could watch get 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:03.910
 our team is on the grip base 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:06.010
 neutral in the center 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:08.850
 or not and if we become then how much 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.330
 and how quickly will not be able to capture 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.010
 our task is to call a set of points in the center 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.310
 closer to the right flank 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.970
 because there fireflies usually come out 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:22.970
 you need to gather them about yourself as 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:25.420
 dog kukava medvedev not to 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:27.690
 We know, we ran, jumped 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:30.060
 and frolicked and in no case 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.360
 distracted by the center 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.670
 there will be a base capture 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:37.820
 this is the first second we need to divert those 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.520
 percent who have not had time to call for 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.580
 piece of iron move for piece of metal that's there 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:45.930
 frills will be just on the rise to 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.980
 they didn't go there 

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:50.350
 again come down but shoot us differently 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:52.460
 according to us 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:54.640
 and third 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.560
 but not the last marigold right bill 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.510
 flank so they are not that armenia our base 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:02.070
 sat in the bushes and shot at us well 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.670
 let the last percentage know 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.940
 map of the enemy that here we are here we are 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:10.789
 such good easy targets to shoot 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:12.930
 Panama is also by no means 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.279
 invaders base 

00:02:16.279 --> 00:02:18.729
 I'm showing I'm waiting for the stankin act somebody on 

00:02:18.729 --> 00:02:20.859
 capture and see that capture principle already 

00:02:20.859 --> 00:02:23.739
 I went to see that there is still stretching 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:27.339
 some who decide to make their maneuver 

00:02:27.339 --> 00:02:30.319
 he is called red rag 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:32.119
 i.e 

00:02:32.119 --> 00:02:34.549

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:40.519
 to myself 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:43.809
 just not to touch the invaders 

00:02:43.809 --> 00:02:45.659
 each 

00:02:45.659 --> 00:02:52.419
