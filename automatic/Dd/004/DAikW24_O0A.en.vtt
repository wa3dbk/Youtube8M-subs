00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:05.070
 78% will be 15% of any number? 

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:10.060
 We have an anonymous number here, and if we take 15% 

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:13.000
 Of this number, we will get 78 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.079
 To mark the unknown number with the symbol x 

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:24.510
 We know that if we take 15% of X, that is x x 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.990
 15% = 78 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:34.330
 Now we find the value of x 

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:37.880
 15% means you are dealing 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:39.600
 With the ratio, the issue will be easier if it is 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.240
 In hexadecimal format 

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:48.350
 As you know, 15% is 15% of 100 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:50.040
 This literal interpretation of the word percentage 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:54.560
 A hundred means 100, so our denominator equals 0.15 

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:58.060
 Or 15 percent 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:03.600
 If the issue can be written as x 0.15x 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:11.510
 = 78 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:15.570
 We can now divide the two ends of the equation at 0.15 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.460
 In order to find the value o 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.130
 If we start with the left side and divide it to 0.15, you have 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:24.140
 Select 0.15 because this number is 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.030
 What do I have vs Q. 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:28.580
 Now let me multiply x x 15.15 and then 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:31.700
 I swear to 0.15, I will get the value of x 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.110
 This step is complete 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:35.680
 If you do it on the left side, I have to do it 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:36.930
 On the right side 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.420
 0.15 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.460
 This is canceled, and became o = 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:47.600
 78 divided by 0.15 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.000
 Now we find the value of x 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.900
 If we have a calculator, the process will be straightforward, however 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:53.860
 Let us do it ourselves 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:58.460
 We have 78 divided by 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.840
 Decimal number 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.870
 And larger than 78 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:05.790
 Let us now find the value of the number, so I will put 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.050
 Some zeros here 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:08.490
 The result will not be an integer 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:12.860
 It will be divided by 0.15 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:16.030
 To simplify this, let's hit each of the rugs 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.330
 The denominator is 100, thus 0.15 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:20.720
 Become 15 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.530
 0.15x100 = 15 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.220
 I just moved the decimal point to the right 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.500
 I will write this in a different color 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.470
 Here, the decimal place will be decimal 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:34.600
 Let me erase this, so as not to disturb you 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.480
 We also performed the process for 15, if we did the same thing 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:37.520
 With 78 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:42.810
 If we move the decimal places to the right, one, two 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:48.350
 The number will be 7.800 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:52.530
 That is 78 / 0.15 equal 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.880
 7.800 / 15, now we hit the rugs 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.240
 Which is 100 

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:01.890
 Let's do it now 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:06.140
 7 can not be divided by 15, so the result is 0 and 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:07.920
 We can say 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:08.960
 This will not give us a product 

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:12.210
 Now how much is 78/15 output? 

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:13.040
 Let's think about it 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:18.640
 60/15 = 4 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:20.770
 15x5 = 75 

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:23.470
 Output will be 5 if 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:24.550
 5x15 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:27.810
 5x5 = 25 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:29.150
 We put 2 in hand 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:31.920
 5x1 = 5, + 2 = 7 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.040
 75, now we ask 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:36.890
 78-75 = 3 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:38.260
 Download 0 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.220
 Download 0 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:44.220
 30-15 = 2 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.430
 2x15 = 30 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:47.310
 We ask 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:48.480
 There is no rest for us 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.040
 Take down the next zero 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:52.750
 We are still to the left of the decimal point 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:54.470
 Here is the decimal point 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:57.170
 We have to put it here 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:58.670
 If we have one status 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:00.730
 We will now drop the next zero 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:03.330
 0/15 = 0 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:05.520
 0x15 = 0 

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:06.640
 We ask 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:08.030
 There is no rest 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:13.670
 If 78 / 0.15 = 520 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:16.510
 If the value of x is 520 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:21.170
 Thus 78 equals 15% of 520 

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:23.500
 If we use the term maybe 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:26.945
 Used frequently in math lessons, is that 15% is the ratio 

00:04:26.945 --> 00:04:31.990
 It's the percentage 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:36.420
 520, which number we have found its value 

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:38.220
 Who took the percentage of it 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:40.410
 That is the basis 

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:43.520
 It's the foundation 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:46.370
 If we take a percentage of the basis 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:48.850
 This is called the equivalent quantity 

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:53.350
 In this case, the 78 was the equivalent quantity 

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:56.160
 And you can count it as a ratio 

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:58.540
 basically 

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:01.040
 It's good to know all these terms 

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:01.570
 For use in lots 

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:02.790
 But the important thing is to be able 

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:03.960
 To answer the question 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:09.750
 This is logical, because 15% 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:10.350
 Very small percentage 

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:13.230
 If 78 percent of a certain number, it means 

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:18.020
 The number will be very large, and the output we obtained proves this 

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:19.530
 It's a true output 

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:25.030
 Where 78 is exactly equivalent to 15% of 520
