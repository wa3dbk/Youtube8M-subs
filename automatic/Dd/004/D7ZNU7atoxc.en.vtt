00:00:05.639 --> 00:00:05.649 
I'd like to show you the installation of

00:00:05.649 --> 00:00:08.630 
I'd like to show you the installation of
my<00:00:05.890> mocks<00:00:06.850> on<00:00:07.060> vice<00:00:07.330> by<00:00:07.720> benchcrafted

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:08.640 
my mocks on vice by benchcrafted

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:10.620 
my mocks on vice by benchcrafted
normally<00:00:09.640> these<00:00:09.730> are<00:00:09.880> recommended<00:00:10.210> to<00:00:10.420> be

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:10.630 
normally these are recommended to be

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:12.840 
normally these are recommended to be
installed<00:00:11.080> in<00:00:11.620> a<00:00:11.740> detachable<00:00:12.100> arrangement

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:12.850 
installed in a detachable arrangement

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:14.160 
installed in a detachable arrangement
where<00:00:12.970> they<00:00:13.060> clamp<00:00:13.330> to<00:00:13.480> the<00:00:13.570> bench<00:00:13.750> top<00:00:13.990> and

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:14.170 
where they clamp to the bench top and

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:16.140 
where they clamp to the bench top and
then<00:00:14.260> taken<00:00:14.620> off<00:00:14.770> but<00:00:15.340> I<00:00:15.460> find<00:00:15.730> it<00:00:15.820> much<00:00:15.940> more

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:16.150 
then taken off but I find it much more

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:17.669 
then taken off but I find it much more
convenient<00:00:16.509> to<00:00:16.720> have<00:00:16.900> mine<00:00:17.140> permanently

00:00:17.669 --> 00:00:17.679 
convenient to have mine permanently

00:00:17.679 --> 00:00:19.829 
convenient to have mine permanently
installed<00:00:18.130> I<00:00:18.429> have<00:00:18.880> the<00:00:19.029> benefit<00:00:19.359> of<00:00:19.419> having

00:00:19.829 --> 00:00:19.839 
installed I have the benefit of having

00:00:19.839 --> 00:00:22.650 
installed I have the benefit of having
to<00:00:20.080> work<00:00:20.320> benches<00:00:20.830> so<00:00:21.189> I<00:00:21.220> have<00:00:21.640> a<00:00:21.669> leg<00:00:22.179> vise<00:00:22.359> in

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:22.660 
to work benches so I have a leg vise in

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:24.659 
to work benches so I have a leg vise in
one<00:00:22.869> and<00:00:23.169> I've<00:00:23.499> got<00:00:23.679> this<00:00:23.800> mocks<00:00:24.099> on<00:00:24.279> vise<00:00:24.490> in

00:00:24.659 --> 00:00:24.669 
one and I've got this mocks on vise in

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:29.759 
one and I've got this mocks on vise in
the<00:00:24.820> other<00:00:25.619> it's<00:00:26.619> installed<00:00:27.369> with<00:00:28.470> bolts<00:00:29.470> one

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:29.769 
the other it's installed with bolts one

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:31.950 
the other it's installed with bolts one
one<00:00:30.009> side<00:00:30.249> one<00:00:30.669> the<00:00:30.699> other<00:00:30.970> and<00:00:31.269> then<00:00:31.779> these

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:31.960 
one side one the other and then these

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:36.630 
one side one the other and then these
lovely<00:00:32.350> wheels<00:00:32.590> just<00:00:33.160> spin<00:00:33.600> freely<00:00:35.640> allowing

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:36.640 
lovely wheels just spin freely allowing

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:41.070 
lovely wheels just spin freely allowing
the<00:00:36.760> jaws<00:00:37.000> to<00:00:37.300> go<00:00:37.680> back<00:00:38.680> and<00:00:38.860> forwards<00:00:40.080> it's

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:41.080 
the jaws to go back and forwards it's

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:43.620 
the jaws to go back and forwards it's
great<00:00:41.320> for<00:00:41.500> dovetailing<00:00:41.980> you<00:00:42.820> can<00:00:42.970> clamp<00:00:43.360> long

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:43.630 
great for dovetailing you can clamp long

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:45.570 
great for dovetailing you can clamp long
boards<00:00:44.140> I've<00:00:44.320> got<00:00:44.530> two<00:00:44.740> feet<00:00:45.010> between<00:00:45.280> the

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:45.580 
boards I've got two feet between the

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:47.460 
boards I've got two feet between the
screws<00:00:45.910> here<00:00:46.180> so<00:00:46.540> that's<00:00:46.780> long<00:00:47.080> enough<00:00:47.110> for

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:47.470 
screws here so that's long enough for

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:48.930 
screws here so that's long enough for
anything<00:00:47.710> I'm<00:00:47.980> likely<00:00:48.250> to<00:00:48.370> ever<00:00:48.610> want<00:00:48.850> to

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:48.940 
anything I'm likely to ever want to

00:00:48.940 --> 00:01:06.330 
anything I'm likely to ever want to
dovetail<00:00:49.450> and<00:00:49.630> it<00:00:50.620> works<00:00:50.860> really<00:00:51.130> nicely<00:01:05.340> I'll

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:06.340 
dovetail and it works really nicely I'll

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:12.630 
dovetail and it works really nicely I'll
spin<00:01:06.789> it<00:01:06.909> out<00:01:09.539> and<00:01:10.539> that's<00:01:10.780> it<00:01:11.219> so<00:01:12.219> the<00:01:12.340> actual

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:12.640 
spin it out and that's it so the actual

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:19.620 
spin it out and that's it so the actual
vice<00:01:12.850> itself<00:01:14.819> can<00:01:15.819> open<00:01:16.149> up<00:01:16.270> a<00:01:18.299> fair<00:01:19.299> amount

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:19.630 
vice itself can open up a fair amount

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:21.779 
vice itself can open up a fair amount
and<00:01:19.840> get<00:01:20.229> two<00:01:20.679> and<00:01:20.799> a<00:01:20.829> half<00:01:21.009> inches<00:01:21.399> in<00:01:21.460> there

00:01:21.779 --> 00:01:21.789 
and get two and a half inches in there

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:24.149 
and get two and a half inches in there
with<00:01:21.909> the<00:01:21.999> way<00:01:22.119> it's<00:01:22.329> set<00:01:22.710> I'll<00:01:23.710> just<00:01:23.920> take

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:24.159 
with the way it's set I'll just take

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:39.120 
with the way it's set I'll just take
these<00:01:24.310> off<00:01:35.460> and<00:01:36.460> you<00:01:36.579> can<00:01:36.729> see<00:01:36.759> the<00:01:37.319> the<00:01:38.319> jaws

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.130 
these off and you can see the the jaws

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:40.980 
these off and you can see the the jaws
they're<00:01:39.520> aligned<00:01:40.030> with<00:01:40.329> this<00:01:40.539> double-sided

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:40.990 
they're aligned with this double-sided

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:43.980 
they're aligned with this double-sided
suede<00:01:41.880> and<00:01:42.880> one<00:01:43.149> of<00:01:43.240> the<00:01:43.329> other<00:01:43.450> things<00:01:43.749> that's

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:43.990 
suede and one of the other things that's

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:47.429 
suede and one of the other things that's
cut<00:01:44.319> on<00:01:44.530> these<00:01:44.770> are<00:01:45.240> elongated<00:01:46.240> holes<00:01:46.509> so<00:01:47.259> it's

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:47.439 
cut on these are elongated holes so it's

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:49.559 
cut on these are elongated holes so it's
a<00:01:47.530> circle<00:01:47.979> which<00:01:48.159> has<00:01:48.189> just<00:01:48.490> been<00:01:48.609> elongated<00:01:48.969> a

00:01:49.559 --> 00:01:49.569 
a circle which has just been elongated a

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:52.739 
a circle which has just been elongated a
bit<00:01:49.780> and<00:01:50.439> that<00:01:50.530> allows<00:01:50.859> that<00:01:51.249> to<00:01:51.310> go<00:01:52.149> on<00:01:52.329> here

00:01:52.739 --> 00:01:52.749 
bit and that allows that to go on here

00:01:52.749 --> 00:01:55.109 
bit and that allows that to go on here
and<00:01:53.139> it<00:01:53.469> allows<00:01:53.770> it<00:01:53.799> to<00:01:54.009> pivot<00:01:54.310> from<00:01:54.819> side<00:01:55.090> to

00:01:55.109 --> 00:01:55.119 
and it allows it to pivot from side to

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:58.709 
and it allows it to pivot from side to
side<00:01:55.649> so<00:01:56.649> it's<00:01:57.039> really<00:01:57.490> good<00:01:57.729> at<00:01:57.819> gun<00:01:58.060> clamping

00:01:58.709 --> 00:01:58.719 
side so it's really good at gun clamping

00:01:58.719 --> 00:01:59.850 
side so it's really good at gun clamping
them

00:01:59.850 --> 00:01:59.860 
them

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.680 
them
golde<00:02:00.070> work<00:02:00.280> as<00:02:00.550> well<00:02:01.650> so<00:02:02.650> you<00:02:02.740> can<00:02:02.890> see<00:02:03.100> the

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:03.690 
golde work as well so you can see the

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:08.370 
golde work as well so you can see the
way<00:02:04.690> that<00:02:04.930> the<00:02:05.110> nut<00:02:05.320> has<00:02:05.650> been<00:02:06.060> recessed<00:02:07.380> into

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:08.380 
way that the nut has been recessed into

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:10.710 
way that the nut has been recessed into
the<00:02:08.679> bench<00:02:08.890> top<00:02:09.160> here<00:02:09.460> and<00:02:09.700> there's<00:02:10.660> a

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
the bench top here and there's a

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.270 
the bench top here and there's a
matching<00:02:10.929> nut<00:02:11.290> on<00:02:11.500> the<00:02:11.590> other<00:02:11.740> side<00:02:12.040> which

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
matching nut on the other side which

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.480 
matching nut on the other side which
I'll<00:02:12.490> show<00:02:12.670> you<00:02:12.700> later<00:02:13.830> very<00:02:14.830> often<00:02:15.190> with<00:02:15.340> this

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:15.490 
I'll show you later very often with this

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:17.490 
I'll show you later very often with this
style<00:02:15.850> of<00:02:15.970> vise<00:02:16.240> this<00:02:16.570> dubbed<00:02:16.840> twin<00:02:17.140> screw

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
style of vise this dubbed twin screw

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.620 
style of vise this dubbed twin screw
vise<00:02:17.740> you<00:02:18.010> see<00:02:18.250> them<00:02:18.490> particularly<00:02:19.270> with

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630 
vise you see them particularly with

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:22.020 
vise you see them particularly with
wooden<00:02:19.990> threads<00:02:20.410> mounted<00:02:21.280> quite<00:02:21.520> low<00:02:21.730> down<00:02:22.000> on

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
wooden threads mounted quite low down on

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:23.640 
wooden threads mounted quite low down on
the<00:02:22.240> bench<00:02:22.540> and<00:02:22.780> one<00:02:22.930> of<00:02:23.020> the<00:02:23.080> problems<00:02:23.260> with

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
the bench and one of the problems with

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:25.620 
the bench and one of the problems with
this<00:02:23.920> is<00:02:24.100> that<00:02:24.670> you<00:02:24.730> can<00:02:25.000> get<00:02:25.180> vertical

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
this is that you can get vertical

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:29.010 
this is that you can get vertical
racking<00:02:26.200> so<00:02:26.890> that<00:02:27.040> if<00:02:27.160> you've<00:02:27.310> got<00:02:27.630> the<00:02:28.630> screws

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:29.020 
racking so that if you've got the screws

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:30.780 
racking so that if you've got the screws
fairly<00:02:29.560> low<00:02:29.740> down<00:02:30.070> here<00:02:30.459> and<00:02:30.580> then<00:02:30.670> you're

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
fairly low down here and then you're

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:32.280 
fairly low down here and then you're
putting<00:02:31.090> something<00:02:31.330> in<00:02:31.570> the<00:02:31.690> vise<00:02:31.870> which<00:02:32.110> is

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
putting something in the vise which is

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.680 
putting something in the vise which is
not<00:02:32.440> very<00:02:32.709> high<00:02:32.920> then<00:02:33.459> the<00:02:33.820> little<00:02:34.150> rack<00:02:34.390> the

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
not very high then the little rack the

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:37.860 
not very high then the little rack the
same<00:02:34.900> way<00:02:35.110> as<00:02:35.260> conventional<00:02:35.950> jaws<00:02:36.600> vices<00:02:37.600> rack

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
same way as conventional jaws vices rack

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:39.990 
same way as conventional jaws vices rack
that<00:02:37.900> way<00:02:38.380> so<00:02:39.130> it's<00:02:39.280> quite<00:02:39.430> nice<00:02:39.640> with<00:02:39.880> this

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
that way so it's quite nice with this

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.350 
that way so it's quite nice with this
because<00:02:40.360> the<00:02:40.480> bars<00:02:40.690> are<00:02:40.989> quite<00:02:41.430> thin<00:02:42.430> and<00:02:42.670> I've

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
because the bars are quite thin and I've

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.030 
because the bars are quite thin and I've
got<00:02:43.540> a<00:02:43.570> one<00:02:43.780> and<00:02:43.900> three-quarter<00:02:44.500> inch<00:02:44.709> bench

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
got a one and three-quarter inch bench

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.020 
got a one and three-quarter inch bench
top<00:02:45.370> here<00:02:45.670> and<00:02:46.630> the<00:02:46.870> four-inch<00:02:47.350> skirt<00:02:47.739> here<00:02:48.190> so

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
top here and the four-inch skirt here so

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.270 
top here and the four-inch skirt here so
I'm<00:02:49.390> able<00:02:49.780> to<00:02:49.810> get<00:02:50.080> the<00:02:50.260> nut<00:02:50.440> in<00:02:50.650> from<00:02:51.130> the

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
I'm able to get the nut in from the

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.090 
I'm able to get the nut in from the
other<00:02:51.400> side<00:02:51.730> on<00:02:52.060> there<00:02:52.690> and<00:02:52.930> keep<00:02:53.709> it<00:02:53.860> quite

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:54.100 
other side on there and keep it quite

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:56.100 
other side on there and keep it quite
close<00:02:54.400> to<00:02:54.580> the<00:02:54.700> top<00:02:54.910> and<00:02:55.480> the<00:02:55.600> other<00:02:55.750> thing<00:02:55.989> I

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
close to the top and the other thing I

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:57.690 
close to the top and the other thing I
did<00:02:56.170> it<00:02:56.470> wasn't<00:02:56.739> in<00:02:56.860> the<00:02:56.980> instructions<00:02:57.550> from

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
did it wasn't in the instructions from

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:59.370 
did it wasn't in the instructions from
benchcrafted<00:02:58.060> but<00:02:58.660> the<00:02:58.750> other<00:02:58.930> thing<00:02:59.200> that<00:02:59.230> I

00:02:59.370 --> 00:02:59.380 
benchcrafted but the other thing that I

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.199 
benchcrafted but the other thing that I
did<00:02:59.500> do<00:02:59.860> with<00:03:00.040> this<00:03:00.190> in<00:03:00.400> order<00:03:00.550> to<00:03:00.790> counteract

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:01.209 
did do with this in order to counteract

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:04.800 
did do with this in order to counteract
any<00:03:02.370> potential<00:03:03.370> racking<00:03:03.820> was<00:03:04.480> that<00:03:04.660> when<00:03:04.780> I

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
any potential racking was that when I

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.410 
any potential racking was that when I
cut<00:03:05.110> the<00:03:05.260> vise<00:03:05.470> I<00:03:05.799> actually<00:03:06.190> cut<00:03:06.700> it<00:03:06.880> would<00:03:07.180> at

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 
cut the vise I actually cut it would at

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:09.509 
cut the vise I actually cut it would at
a<00:03:07.510> 2<00:03:07.720> degree<00:03:07.900> angle<00:03:08.470> so<00:03:08.620> that<00:03:08.950> when<00:03:09.190> the<00:03:09.340> vise

00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:09.519 
a 2 degree angle so that when the vise

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:11.880 
a 2 degree angle so that when the vise
closes<00:03:10.150> the<00:03:10.480> top<00:03:10.720> of<00:03:10.900> the<00:03:11.019> vise<00:03:11.200> actually

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:11.890 
closes the top of the vise actually

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:14.070 
closes the top of the vise actually
closes<00:03:12.370> first<00:03:12.730> and<00:03:13.060> then<00:03:13.540> the<00:03:13.630> bottom<00:03:13.900> of<00:03:13.959> the

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:14.080 
closes first and then the bottom of the

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:15.870 
closes first and then the bottom of the
vise<00:03:14.260> catches<00:03:14.769> up<00:03:14.950> and<00:03:15.160> that's<00:03:15.790> just

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:15.880 
vise catches up and that's just

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:18.870 
vise catches up and that's just
something<00:03:16.390> else<00:03:16.510> I<00:03:16.690> did<00:03:16.930> to<00:03:17.140> stop<00:03:17.830> stop<00:03:18.730> the

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:18.880 
something else I did to stop stop the

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.289 
something else I did to stop stop the
racking<00:03:19.739> so<00:03:20.739> let's<00:03:21.730> have<00:03:21.850> a<00:03:21.940> look<00:03:22.060> at<00:03:22.209> the

00:03:22.289 --> 00:03:22.299 
racking so let's have a look at the

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:27.530 
racking so let's have a look at the
underside<00:03:25.380> so<00:03:26.380> with<00:03:26.530> the<00:03:26.620> bench<00:03:26.830> flipped<00:03:27.190> over

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
underside so with the bench flipped over

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.150 
underside so with the bench flipped over
you<00:03:28.540> can<00:03:28.720> see<00:03:28.900> the<00:03:29.049> position<00:03:29.230> of<00:03:29.590> the<00:03:29.709> nuts<00:03:29.920> on

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:30.160 
you can see the position of the nuts on

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.090 
you can see the position of the nuts on
here<00:03:30.489> and<00:03:30.780> how<00:03:31.780> easy<00:03:32.049> the<00:03:32.380> thing<00:03:32.560> to<00:03:32.739> is<00:03:32.890> to

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:33.100 
here and how easy the thing to is to

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:34.949 
here and how easy the thing to is to
install<00:03:33.549> and<00:03:33.820> you<00:03:34.390> could<00:03:34.540> the<00:03:34.630> other<00:03:34.750> thing

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:34.959 
install and you could the other thing

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:36.390 
install and you could the other thing
you<00:03:35.080> can<00:03:35.230> do<00:03:35.410> as<00:03:35.530> well<00:03:35.560> is<00:03:35.920> with<00:03:36.070> the<00:03:36.190> locking

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.400 
you can do as well is with the locking

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.610 
you can do as well is with the locking
nut<00:03:36.730> on<00:03:36.970> the<00:03:37.120> other<00:03:37.269> side<00:03:37.600> and<00:03:37.780> this<00:03:37.959> nut<00:03:38.230> here

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:38.620 
nut on the other side and this nut here

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:41.580 
nut on the other side and this nut here
you<00:03:39.130> can<00:03:39.340> actually<00:03:39.730> alter<00:03:40.030> the<00:03:40.780> projection<00:03:41.440> of

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.590 
you can actually alter the projection of

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:43.620 
you can actually alter the projection of
this<00:03:41.890> so<00:03:42.489> if<00:03:42.549> you<00:03:42.670> only<00:03:42.820> need<00:03:42.940> it<00:03:43.239> for<00:03:43.390> really

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:43.630 
this so if you only need it for really

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:45.810 
this so if you only need it for really
small<00:03:43.690> stuff<00:03:44.230> you<00:03:44.290> can<00:03:44.650> even<00:03:45.220> move<00:03:45.400> the<00:03:45.640> rod

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:45.820 
small stuff you can even move the rod

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:48.360 
small stuff you can even move the rod
even<00:03:46.180> further<00:03:46.420> in<00:03:46.720> here<00:03:47.049> leaving<00:03:47.590> a<00:03:47.799> less<00:03:48.130> of<00:03:48.160> a

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:48.370 
even further in here leaving a less of a

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:51.270 
even further in here leaving a less of a
projection<00:03:48.760> out<00:03:49.060> there<00:03:49.440> so<00:03:50.440> I've<00:03:50.590> had<00:03:51.130> this

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:51.280 
projection out there so I've had this

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:54.390 
projection out there so I've had this
vise<00:03:51.519> now<00:03:51.790> for<00:03:52.090> 6<00:03:52.540> 8<00:03:52.750> months<00:03:52.959> and<00:03:53.380> I<00:03:53.410> found<00:03:54.250> it

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:54.400 
vise now for 6 8 months and I found it

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.000 
vise now for 6 8 months and I found it
to<00:03:54.430> be<00:03:54.580> absolutely<00:03:55.360> invaluable<00:03:55.630> it<00:03:56.560> really<00:03:56.890> is

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:57.010 
to be absolutely invaluable it really is

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:59.970 
to be absolutely invaluable it really is
a<00:03:57.040> great<00:03:57.280> vise<00:03:57.610> and<00:03:57.910> I<00:03:58.690> would<00:03:59.500> recommend

00:03:59.970 --> 00:03:59.980 
a great vise and I would recommend

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:02.400 
a great vise and I would recommend
anyone<00:04:00.250> if<00:04:00.549> they<00:04:00.730> have<00:04:00.940> the<00:04:01.150> space<00:04:01.450> to<00:04:01.750> install

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:02.410 
anyone if they have the space to install

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:03.660 
anyone if they have the space to install
one<00:04:02.650> permanently<00:04:03.280> and

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:03.670 
one permanently and

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:06.150 
one permanently and
they're<00:04:03.880> bench
