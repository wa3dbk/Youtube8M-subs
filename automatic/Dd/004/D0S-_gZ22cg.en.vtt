00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:11.809
 hello and welcome to this new 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:13.400
 mac skill tutorial today 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:15.260
 we will see how to create 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:17.930
 quickly a slideshow of 

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:20.150
 lightroom 4 to do this appointment 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:21.919
 in your collections and choose the 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:23.180
 collection that you want to use 

00:00:21.919 --> 00:00:26.960
 I created a small collection 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:28.399
 slideshow that contains images these 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.110
 images I can change their offer 

00:00:28.399 --> 00:00:32.870
 simply sliding them next to each other 

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:35.239
 others like that once this 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:39.739
 order I agree I'll go in 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:41.929
 the slideshow tab and here I will lé 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:45.010
 choose a model in the explorer of 

00:00:41.929 --> 00:00:47.769
 modem I take for example big screen 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:51.710
 but there are several others 

00:00:47.769 --> 00:00:53.120
 this model there I am going to modify it for 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.309
 that they correspond a little better the 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.379
 tastes i'll start already by going 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:58.370
 in the background section because I 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:02.569
 would like to change the color of back 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:04.909
 plan so I'm going to pick shot 

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:07.540
 the background and then choose this 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:09.800
 color I take a dry not too dark 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:12.440
 because I would like my photos 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:15.650
 gets a name from a drop shadow 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:18.860
 so I'm going up a little bit higher and 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:21.380
 then in the part sion up there I will 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:24.350
 coach reporter then choose my 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:27.200
 angle I could also change the pace 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.640
 quoted his terms and then I'm just going to 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.200
 content to make a king's angle that 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.380
 suits me if the light came from 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.790
 right then would like that my 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.480
 slide show begin and end with a 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:40.720
 little text 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:44.530
 so I go to the title section and 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:46.770
 I validate the screen check introduction I 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:49.560
 will edit the text 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.550
 here I am typing internal introduction 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.020
 welcome obviously we find some 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:55.750
 something more interesting to tell 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:57.790
 I did not see ok to increase his 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:01.780
 size I change the cursor position 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:04.000
 of scale and then for the end I activate 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:07.330
 Then there was added a nameplate 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.840
 what is a finesse of the interface of 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:09.700
 lightroom 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.830
 sometimes the titles are a little bit 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:14.600
 questionable 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:16.040
 ok i'm showing the scale you saw 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:19.100
 still we're going fast enough 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:23.360
 and then now a little bit of 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:25.730
 music in the background for that I activate the 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:28.340
 coach soundtrack and i'm going to look for my 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:34.360
 music I navigate to her 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:37.550
 I will not choose just that and 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:41.330
 I'm going to modify a little bit the 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:47.020
 hard exposure of the slides and then the 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:47.020
 term also fade transitions 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:55.879
 go preview 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.879
 6 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:05.690
 have a little idea by calculating this 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:07.700
 that it gives you here you can 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:09.230
 possibly start a full reading 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:12.550
 screen to have a very good idea of 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:12.550
 what about a new hand start 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:17.780
 it will then remain only 

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.780
 export 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:24.770
 once the slide show matches 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:27.020
 your expectations you just have to 

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:31.730
 go back under lightroom and click on 

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:37.040
 the button export the video named your 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:42.350
 file the export and before exporting 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:47.380
 she's in the video settings and 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:51.110
 choose your definition if 1080p 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:53.870
 click exported is here a few 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:59.390
 minutes you will have your documents 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:04:02.450
 usable videos at dub and rhône 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:04.760
 that's it for today thanks and to 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:07.390
 very soon for a new tutorial of 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:07.390
