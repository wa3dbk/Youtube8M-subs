00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:07.379
 so we test our generator 

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:10.670
 valve type tractor which 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:15.240
 modified by rewinding and 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:20.779
 refined by installing no smoke magnets 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:25.490
 load two 40 watt light bulbs we measure 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:29.480
 voltage load we have 80 watts 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:29.480
 action right now will speed up 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:41.430
 it was 200 turns now what will be 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:41.430
 we have turnover 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:56.750
 so it was 350 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:18.820
 so it was 455 now how much will 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.820
 high these creatures 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:53.670
 it was 500 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:02:11.580
 vessels now how many will be right now will be 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:02:33.420
 seven hundred it was 700 and now there will be 1000 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:36.530
 before it was 1000 and so we test our 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:41.370
 tractor generator valve type 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:46.610
 refined and not magnets without 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:46.610
 rewinding the world of tension 

00:02:54.240 --> 00:03:03.230
 it was two two hundred turns up 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:06.230
 Now what will be often written 650 300 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:06.230
 350 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:19.879
 it was there 100 350 now what will be 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:24.019
 now about 400 

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:24.019
 400 450 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:04:02.540
 as it was 400 450 now what will 

00:03:54.820 --> 00:04:08.290
 now about 700 700 rpm 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:08.290
 get us. this 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:26.270
 it was it was 700 rpm and even 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:26.270
 heart 

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:45.030
 so it was 1000 to 1000 than you can
