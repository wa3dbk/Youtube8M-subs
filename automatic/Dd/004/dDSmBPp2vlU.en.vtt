00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:10.940 

obviously<00:02:10.140> this<00:02:10.229> point<00:02:10.470> I'm<00:02:10.619> looking<00:02:10.860> to

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
obviously this point I'm looking to

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.740 
obviously this point I'm looking to
drawn<00:02:11.130> to<00:02:11.250> a<00:02:11.340> LAN<00:02:11.640> um<00:02:12.560> so<00:02:13.560> I<00:02:14.570> should<00:02:15.570> brainstorm

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
drawn to a LAN um so I should brainstorm

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.020 
drawn to a LAN um so I should brainstorm
at<00:02:16.170> the<00:02:16.290> end<00:02:16.440> of<00:02:16.560> his<00:02:16.710> turn<00:02:16.980> and<00:02:17.160> then<00:02:17.460> the

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
at the end of his turn and then the

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.380 
at the end of his turn and then the
reason<00:02:18.390> for<00:02:18.570> that<00:02:18.600> is<00:02:19.640> it'll<00:02:20.640> laminated<00:02:21.150> cast

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
reason for that is it'll laminated cast

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.240 
reason for that is it'll laminated cast
manager<00:02:21.840> immediately<00:02:21.930> especially<00:02:22.830> now<00:02:23.220> that

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
manager immediately especially now that

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.150 
manager immediately especially now that
he<00:02:23.490> tapped<00:02:23.700> out<00:02:23.820> for<00:02:23.850> the<00:02:24.000> Elspeth<00:02:24.420> so<00:02:25.160> yeah

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
he tapped out for the Elspeth so yeah

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:27.230 
he tapped out for the Elspeth so yeah
especially<00:02:26.460> now<00:02:26.760> that<00:02:26.790> you<00:02:26.940> have<00:02:26.970> done<00:02:27.210> for

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240 
especially now that you have done for

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:28.790 
especially now that you have done for
the<00:02:27.420> Elspeth<00:02:27.720> so<00:02:27.840> you<00:02:27.930> can't<00:02:28.140> possibly<00:02:28.560> have

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
the Elspeth so you can't possibly have

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:33.860 
the Elspeth so you can't possibly have
free<00:02:29.520> counter<00:02:29.790> magica<00:02:32.390> so<00:02:33.390> that<00:02:33.540> was<00:02:33.660> a<00:02:33.690> bit<00:02:33.840> of

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
free counter magica so that was a bit of

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.370 
free counter magica so that was a bit of
a<00:02:33.990> mistake<00:02:34.080> I<00:02:35.270> think<00:02:36.270> drawing<00:02:36.570> the<00:02:36.900> drawing

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
a mistake I think drawing the drawing

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:38.780 
a mistake I think drawing the drawing
the<00:02:37.500> creature<00:02:37.800> i<00:02:37.830> think<00:02:38.100> i<00:02:38.160> should<00:02:38.220> at<00:02:38.640> that

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
the creature i think i should at that

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.100 
the creature i think i should at that
point<00:02:39.000> just<00:02:39.060> gone<00:02:39.270> for<00:02:39.420> the<00:02:39.510> gamble<00:02:39.870> I've

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
point just gone for the gamble I've

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:44.210 
point just gone for the gamble I've
tried<00:02:40.440> to<00:02:40.530> draw<00:02:40.680> into<00:02:40.860> another<00:02:41.070> land<00:02:43.190> but<00:02:44.190> I

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
tried to draw into another land but I

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.090 
tried to draw into another land but I
think<00:02:44.640> I<00:02:44.730> was<00:02:44.940> I<00:02:45.600> think<00:02:46.110> I<00:02:46.200> thought<00:02:46.440> that<00:02:46.650> I'd

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
think I was I think I thought that I'd

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:55.850 
think I was I think I thought that I'd
have<00:02:47.280> the<00:02:47.400> game<00:02:47.550> wrapped<00:02:47.820> up<00:02:48.030> if<00:02:54.380> ok<00:02:55.380> so<00:02:55.440> I'm

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
have the game wrapped up if ok so I'm

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:57.950 
have the game wrapped up if ok so I'm
anyway<00:02:56.580> I<00:02:56.730> thought<00:02:57.060> I<00:02:57.120> had<00:02:57.330> the<00:02:57.450> I<00:02:57.630> think<00:02:57.930> I

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:57.960 
anyway I thought I had the I think I

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:59.540 
anyway I thought I had the I think I
thought<00:02:58.170> I<00:02:58.200> had<00:02:58.410> the<00:02:58.530> game<00:02:58.710> wrap<00:02:58.890> up<00:02:59.040> wrapped

00:02:59.540 --> 00:02:59.550 
thought I had the game wrap up wrapped

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:01.520 
thought I had the game wrap up wrapped
up<00:02:59.730> if<00:02:59.910> I<00:03:00.000> drew<00:03:00.210> an<00:03:00.510> extra<00:03:00.780> land<00:03:00.960> to<00:03:01.200> cast<00:03:01.440> the

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
up if I drew an extra land to cast the

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.870 
up if I drew an extra land to cast the
famines<00:03:01.860> here<00:03:02.120> so<00:03:03.120> I<00:03:03.150> was<00:03:03.540> hoping<00:03:03.870> uh<00:03:04.110> that<00:03:04.880> I'd

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
famines here so I was hoping uh that I'd

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:07.970 
famines here so I was hoping uh that I'd
have<00:03:06.060> a<00:03:06.090> land<00:03:06.330> at<00:03:06.420> the<00:03:06.480> top<00:03:06.660> for<00:03:06.990> a<00:03:07.260> brainstorm

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
have a land at the top for a brainstorm

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:09.320 
have a land at the top for a brainstorm
and<00:03:08.100> of<00:03:08.220> trend<00:03:08.430> would<00:03:08.520> only<00:03:08.670> have<00:03:08.880> given<00:03:09.180> me

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 
and of trend would only have given me

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:11.120 
and of trend would only have given me
three<00:03:09.870> lance<00:03:10.170> it<00:03:10.470> would<00:03:10.590> have<00:03:10.680> been<00:03:10.740> more<00:03:10.950> of<00:03:11.040> a

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
three lance it would have been more of a

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:14.979 
three lance it would have been more of a
gamble<00:03:11.459> um<00:03:12.620> but<00:03:13.620> you<00:03:14.190> know<00:03:14.220> would<00:03:14.550> have<00:03:14.640> work

00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:14.989 
gamble um but you know would have work

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:17.479 
gamble um but you know would have work
or<00:03:15.989> we<00:03:16.380> would've<00:03:16.680> worked<00:03:16.830> out<00:03:16.980> either<00:03:17.370> way

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
or we would've worked out either way

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:19.130 
or we would've worked out either way
either<00:03:17.880> way<00:03:18.000> didn't<00:03:18.300> work<00:03:18.330> out<00:03:18.540> so<00:03:18.780> I<00:03:18.810> kind<00:03:19.110> of

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
either way didn't work out so I kind of

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:21.080 
either way didn't work out so I kind of
got<00:03:19.260> the<00:03:19.290> worst<00:03:19.590> deal<00:03:19.950> because<00:03:20.610> I<00:03:20.790> didn't<00:03:20.970> even

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
got the worst deal because I didn't even

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:36.350 
got the worst deal because I didn't even
have<00:03:21.209> to<00:03:21.480> land<00:03:21.630> open

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.360 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:40.070 

so<00:03:36.990> unfortunately<00:03:37.650> um<00:03:38.120> so<00:03:39.120> anyway<00:03:39.480> that<00:03:39.750> play

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:40.080 
so unfortunately um so anyway that play

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:42.740 
so unfortunately um so anyway that play
I<00:03:40.110> was<00:03:40.320> trying<00:03:40.560> to<00:03:40.620> count<00:03:40.830> on<00:03:40.950> at<00:03:41.130> having<00:03:41.750> the

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
I was trying to count on at having the

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:45.050 
I was trying to count on at having the
two<00:03:43.080> whether<00:03:43.740> Wayfarers<00:03:44.340> and<00:03:44.580> the<00:03:44.850> fourth

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
two whether Wayfarers and the fourth

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:46.730 
two whether Wayfarers and the fourth
will<00:03:45.270> get<00:03:45.420> in<00:03:45.570> so<00:03:45.780> basically<00:03:46.140> if<00:03:46.290> I<00:03:46.380> resolve

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:46.740 
will get in so basically if I resolve

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:48.680 
will get in so basically if I resolve
one<00:03:47.010> of<00:03:47.100> the<00:03:47.190> weather<00:03:47.940> Wayfarers<00:03:48.480> I'm<00:03:48.600> in

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
one of the weather Wayfarers I'm in

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:54.020 
one of the weather Wayfarers I'm in
really<00:03:48.840> good<00:03:49.020> shape<00:03:52.400> keep<00:03:53.400> in<00:03:53.520> mind<00:03:53.550> i<00:03:53.850> still

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
really good shape keep in mind i still

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:55.580 
really good shape keep in mind i still
have<00:03:54.150> a<00:03:54.180> file<00:03:54.450> on<00:03:54.480> top<00:03:54.780> of<00:03:54.930> my<00:03:55.020> library<00:03:55.410> so

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
have a file on top of my library so

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:57.560 
have a file on top of my library so
saving<00:03:55.950> the<00:03:56.190> the<00:03:56.790> weather<00:03:56.970> wafer<00:03:57.300> at<00:03:57.420> this

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:57.570 
saving the the weather wafer at this

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:59.660 
saving the the weather wafer at this
point<00:03:57.840> is<00:03:57.990> worth<00:03:58.170> another<00:03:58.500> is<00:03:58.860> worth

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
point is worth another is worth

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:01.250 
point is worth another is worth
basically<00:04:00.030> two<00:04:00.210> cards<00:04:00.480> because<00:04:00.630> there's<00:04:01.110> no

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
basically two cards because there's no

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.190 
basically two cards because there's no
way<00:04:01.380> I<00:04:01.440> want<00:04:01.650> to<00:04:01.710> see<00:04:01.830> a<00:04:01.860> third<00:04:02.070> file<00:04:02.280> so<00:04:02.700> um<00:04:03.200> I'm

trying to get the other one down Woods
kind<00:04:09.540> of<00:04:09.630> funny<00:04:09.840> is<00:04:10.020> um<00:04:10.230> if<00:04:10.410> I'd<00:04:10.560> actually

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:10.709 
kind of funny is um if I'd actually

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:12.290 
kind of funny is um if I'd actually
played<00:04:11.010> out<00:04:11.130> the<00:04:11.220> file<00:04:11.459> instead<00:04:11.880> of<00:04:11.940> the

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:12.300 
played out the file instead of the

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:14.510 
played out the file instead of the
weather<00:04:13.080> Wayfarer<00:04:13.470> on<00:04:13.590> beat<00:04:13.830> I've<00:04:14.040> been<00:04:14.250> a<00:04:14.280> lot

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:14.520 
weather Wayfarer on beat I've been a lot

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:17.240 
weather Wayfarer on beat I've been a lot
better<00:04:14.550> shape<00:04:14.910> because<00:04:15.650> I<00:04:16.650> could<00:04:17.040> have<00:04:17.130> been

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250 
better shape because I could have been

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:35.990 
better shape because I could have been
filing<00:04:17.519> in<00:04:17.790> the<00:04:17.910> weather<00:04:18.150> wicker

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.000 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.700

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:37.710 
anyway so he brings some sand he's got

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:40.430 
anyway so he brings some sand he's got
another<00:04:37.950> counter<00:04:38.280> pill<00:04:38.460> so<00:04:38.640> um<00:04:39.170> that<00:04:40.170> means

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:40.440 
another counter pill so um that means

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:43.640 
another counter pill so um that means
that<00:04:40.680> I<00:04:40.710> lose<00:04:41.160> basically<00:04:41.820> all<00:04:42.060> my<00:04:42.410> attack<00:04:43.410> plan

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:43.650 
that I lose basically all my attack plan

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:45.020 
that I lose basically all my attack plan
and<00:04:43.890> he's<00:04:43.980> got<00:04:44.130> him<00:04:44.220> at<00:04:44.310> his<00:04:44.430> factory<00:04:44.850> so<00:04:45.000> I

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:45.030 
and he's got him at his factory so I

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:48.530 
and he's got him at his factory so I
can't<00:04:45.300> swing<00:04:45.540> him<00:04:45.720> um<00:04:46.760> so<00:04:47.760> I<00:04:47.790> just<00:04:48.210> play<00:04:48.390> out<00:04:48.510> a

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:48.540 
can't swing him um so I just play out a

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:53.540 
can't swing him um so I just play out a
mother<00:04:51.710> so<00:04:52.710> anyway<00:04:52.980> that<00:04:53.010> really<00:04:53.340> didn't<00:04:53.490> work

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:53.550 
mother so anyway that really didn't work

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:55.250 
mother so anyway that really didn't work
out<00:04:53.730> for<00:04:53.790> me<00:04:53.970> I<00:04:54.060> had<00:04:54.270> I<00:04:54.510> had<00:04:54.570> really<00:04:55.020> four

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:55.260 
out for me I had I had really four

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.530 
out for me I had I had really four
chances<00:04:55.620> to<00:04:55.740> resolve<00:04:56.160> on<00:04:56.460> the<00:04:57.390> weather

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:57.540 
chances to resolve on the weather

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:00.830 
chances to resolve on the weather
wayfarer<00:04:58.190> plan<00:04:59.190> um<00:04:59.550> basically<00:05:00.420> if<00:05:00.630> you<00:05:00.690> get<00:05:00.810> a

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:00.840 
wayfarer plan um basically if you get a

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:03.250 
wayfarer plan um basically if you get a
weather<00:05:01.020> Wayfarer<00:05:01.410> down<00:05:01.590> then<00:05:01.830> you<00:05:01.920> win<00:05:02.130> um

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:03.260 
weather Wayfarer down then you win um

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:07.490 
weather Wayfarer down then you win um
but<00:05:04.260> then<00:05:04.530> I<00:05:04.890> didn't<00:05:05.730> so<00:05:06.300> I<00:05:06.330> resign<00:05:07.230> at<00:05:07.350> this

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:07.500 
but then I didn't so I resign at this

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:09.740 
but then I didn't so I resign at this
point<00:05:07.770> obviously<00:05:08.370> I<00:05:08.610> why<00:05:09.270> should<00:05:09.540> have<00:05:09.630> waited

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:09.750 
point obviously I why should have waited

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:11.030 
point obviously I why should have waited
for<00:05:09.870> him<00:05:10.020> to<00:05:10.050> Philippians<00:05:10.470> factor<00:05:10.770> pics<00:05:10.950> I

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:11.040 
for him to Philippians factor pics I

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:14.450 
for him to Philippians factor pics I
mean<00:05:11.220> theoretically<00:05:12.290> well<00:05:13.290> actually<00:05:13.800> I<00:05:14.040> don't

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:14.460 
mean theoretically well actually I don't

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:15.500 
mean theoretically well actually I don't
think<00:05:14.610> there's<00:05:14.760> I<00:05:14.940> don't<00:05:15.030> think<00:05:15.360> it's<00:05:15.450> even

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:15.510 
think there's I don't think it's even

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:17.900 
think there's I don't think it's even
mathematically<00:05:15.900> possible<00:05:16.320> for<00:05:16.770> him<00:05:16.830> to<00:05:16.950> flip

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:17.910 
mathematically possible for him to flip

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:19.040 
mathematically possible for him to flip
stuff<00:05:18.180> it<00:05:18.330> won't<00:05:18.570> win<00:05:18.750> in<00:05:18.870> this<00:05:18.930> situation

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:19.050 
stuff it won't win in this situation

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:21.580 
stuff it won't win in this situation
he's<00:05:19.560> already<00:05:19.740> got<00:05:19.919> two<00:05:20.370> factories<00:05:20.820> down<00:05:21.000> um

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:21.590 
he's already got two factories down um

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:24.260 
he's already got two factories down um
so<00:05:22.590> he's<00:05:22.890> pretty<00:05:23.100> golden<00:05:23.580> to<00:05:23.790> win<00:05:24.030> this<00:05:24.150> game

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:24.270 
so he's pretty golden to win this game

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:28.250 
so he's pretty golden to win this game
almost<00:05:24.720> no<00:05:25.169> matter<00:05:25.320> what<00:05:25.500> happens<00:05:25.640> but<00:05:26.640> um<00:05:27.480> you

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:28.260 
almost no matter what happens but um you

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.380 
almost no matter what happens but um you
know<00:05:28.350> this<00:05:28.590> point<00:05:28.860> it's<00:05:29.100> so<00:05:29.310> low<00:05:29.610> probability

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:30.390 
know this point it's so low probability

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:31.280 
know this point it's so low probability
that<00:05:30.480> I'm<00:05:30.600> actually<00:05:30.750> going<00:05:31.020> to<00:05:31.110> pull<00:05:31.260> this

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:31.290 
that I'm actually going to pull this

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:33.380 
that I'm actually going to pull this
game<00:05:31.590> out<00:05:31.770> that<00:05:32.280> it's<00:05:32.550> actually<00:05:33.210> a<00:05:33.240> better

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:33.390 
game out that it's actually a better

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:34.850 
game out that it's actually a better
decision<00:05:33.750> to<00:05:33.960> resign<00:05:34.080> right<00:05:34.320> now<00:05:34.470> to<00:05:34.530> give

we have a disconnection problem after
the<00:06:02.250> sideboard<00:06:02.910> and<00:06:03.060> then<00:06:03.930> um<00:06:04.320> so<00:06:05.130> I<00:06:05.160> turn<00:06:05.610> off

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:05.640 
the sideboard and then um so I turn off

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:07.940 
the sideboard and then um so I turn off

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:07.950 
I turn off cam studio and I forget to

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:09.560 
I turn off cam studio and I forget to
turn<00:06:08.100> it<00:06:08.220> back<00:06:08.250> on<00:06:08.370> so<00:06:08.729> we<00:06:08.910> actually<00:06:09.090> miss<00:06:09.390> game

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:09.570 
turn it back on so we actually miss game

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:11.840 
turn it back on so we actually miss game
too
