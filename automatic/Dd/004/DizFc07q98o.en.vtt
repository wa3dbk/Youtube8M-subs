 hello today we are with you 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:10.880
 braid fishtail or as it is called 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.880
 spikelet 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:20.779
 divide hair into two equal strands you 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:22.119
 turned out big left and big 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:25.119
 right strand 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:28.660
 separate part of the hair from the left strand and 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:31.460
 attach it to the big right strand 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:35.030
 now separate and part of the hair from the right 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:38.540
 strand and attach it to the big left 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:41.870
 strands again separate part of the hair from 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:44.110
 left strand and shift it to the right 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:47.140
 arm to the right strand 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:50.210
 separate the part of the hair from the right strand and 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:52.270
 we shift it in the left hand to the left 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:52.270
 strands 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:59.530
 separate the order 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:01.990
 and shift it to the right strand 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:05.290
 separate the next order and 

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:08.150
 we shift it to the left strand 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:11.690
 separating part of the hair from the left again 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:13.060
 strands and shift it in the right hand to 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:16.300
 right strand 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:19.430
 separate the part of the hair from the right strand and 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:25.370
 shift it to the left strand in the left 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:28.790
 arm so we continue to weave 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:31.070
 farther as you see we separate 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:34.660
 alternately part of the hair from each strand 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:38.570
 side and just attach it to 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:42.740
 the opposite of the big period 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:50.000
 principle of weaving spit spit or like me 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:52.910
 Looking for calls fishtail if understood 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:02:01.990
 the principle of weaving that braid weaves very 

00:01:52.910 --> 00:02:01.990
 just and so we weave to the very end 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:34.769
 fix weaving rezinochki 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:43.230
 hair our braid fish tail 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:44.910
 ready for this all thanks for watching and 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.660
