Hello everyone, my name is Qi Zhang.

00:00:11.239 --> 00:00:13.239
I come from Zhejiang Province, China.

00:00:13.278 --> 00:00:19.278
I have studied in UBIC for over 1 year and successfully progressed to

00:00:19.718 --> 00:00:21.718
a master's degree course at the University of Brighton.

00:00:34.634 --> 00:00:36.634
This is the entrance of our study area,

00:00:36.637 --> 00:00:39.637
students can use the lift here,

00:00:40.305 --> 00:00:45.305
There's a lift to all floors of the College.

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.800
Here is a staircase.

00:00:47.957 --> 00:00:54.836
If you want to exercise, you can take the stairs.

00:00:54.837 --> 00:00:59.837
This is the bathroom

00:01:02.837 --> 00:01:09.837
There is a big mirror in the ladies' room, 

00:01:09.838 --> 00:01:12.000
where you can make sure you dress properly!

00:01:23.704 --> 00:01:25.704
This is the teaching area,

00:01:25.705 --> 00:01:31.314
This is our classroom and we have most of our classes here.

00:01:31.597 --> 00:01:37.597
Some students are studying and discussing in the classroom right now. 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.580
There is a big lecture room.

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:43.670
We have a weekly student meeting, where we discuss social activities and travel destinations,

00:01:49.837 --> 00:01:52.840
like London, Paris and so on.

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:08.360
All teaching activities are carried out in this area.

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:14.680
Normally we have a 5 minute break time between classes. Students come out of their classrooms and will chat in the corridors.

00:02:17.881 --> 00:02:24.080
You will meet lots of new friends from different countries and cultures, 

00:02:24.634 --> 00:02:29.630
This corridor has many beautiful memories for me!

00:02:31.711 --> 00:02:36.710
I met many new friends here.

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:51.680
Hi, this is our IT room. Normally we use the IT room to search for the newest study resources and exchange ideas with tutors.

00:03:00.387 --> 00:03:04.590
For example, we had a course called 'Marketing Research'.

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:10.080
We collected the newest resources about the selected company,

00:03:10.905 --> 00:03:13.900
then discussed new ideas with the tutor

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:19.320
in order to improve the performance of this company.

00:03:20.501 --> 00:03:28.500
The tutor will stand here to hear all 
the research collected by the students.

00:03:31.074 --> 00:03:40.070
Students will discuss the problem they faced and their new proposal here.

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:44.180
If students have a new idea they want to present to their classmates

00:03:44.544 --> 00:03:49.140
they can stand here and use the projector

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:52.800
to showcase their amazing thoughts!
