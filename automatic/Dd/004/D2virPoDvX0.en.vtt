00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:05.510
 because the dog has a wet nose 

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:13.740
 so long ago not long after 

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:17.800
 world creation begins to rain 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:20.310
 it was a pouring rain with showers that 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:24.869
 they fell from the sky like steel bars 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.869
 and they never seemed to stop 

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:31.990
 it was then that a man named noah who 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:36.129
 he was very wise he started building one 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:38.829
 big rescue boat was made of 

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:42.070
 a huge amount of logs and fu 

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:46.239
 called ark 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:49.530
 noe seeks everywhere and collects all 

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:53.710
 creatures that came to mind 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:56.710
 Rome, who even invited ark trani 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:58.180
 and to the 13 of being creeping that the 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:00.610
 most people 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:05.530
 kills by trampling them or with them 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:09.610
 insecticides last on board the ark 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:12.490
 noah salts the dog was such 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:16.149
 mixture of things that was impossible 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:20.140
 say what kind it was but one thing was 

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:26.170
 sure he had a big black nose and 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:28.990
 suddenly the ark emitted a soft 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:30.640
 loud creak and leaned over one 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:33.250
 side 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:35.860
 he held his breath and thought with 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:39.000
 fear that the ark was too heavy 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:42.820
 heavy to stay afloat 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:46.200
 then a powerful wave arrives and the boat does 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:49.299
 he bent the other way but in spite of everything 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:52.530
 floated and began his journey 

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:52.530
 towards the unknown 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:02:00.070
 They took off the earth gradually 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:03.280
 disappeared and all around were alone 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:05.799
 sea ​​and sky continued to rain more 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:09.099
 strong than ever and from black clouds 

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:12.790
 anti-similar zig zag flashes descended 

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:15.099
 snake tongues but except noise 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:19.599
 Rain and thunder was 

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:22.560
 an absolute quiet no sound in the 

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:22.560
 whole world 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:29.110
 except in the ark naturally not 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:31.030
 there was a difference between day and night a 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:34.480
 the cries of the people were heard every hour 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:37.599
 parrots, or the howls of hyenas noah 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:40.720
 he had no peace or a moment to sleep 

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:44.170
 he was too busy looking for honey for 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:49.690
 bears or hazelnuts for squirrels o 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:52.420
 untold things for and the last pythons 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:54.760
 animal had just finished dinner and 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:58.000
 it was already time to think about breakfast 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:00.970
 for the first 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:04.030
 but one early morning after 20 days 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:04.890
 night sailing events at sea 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:08.610
 open 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:12.880
 a really terrible thing happened 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:16.090
 the hole in the ark opened between the holes 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:18.220
 asti was not bigger than a nut not 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:19.750
 much for a boat as big as a field 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:23.250
 of football 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:26.770
 but before noah could cry out for help 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:28.870
 water was everywhere and a rabbit 

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:32.440
 he had already been rescued 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:36.100
 and now what we can do 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:39.600
 he said no and the dog had to study a 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:39.600
 slowly and quickly 

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:50.980
 eureka we put it here nothing 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:53.230
 panic the donkeys cut the monkeys 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:56.890
 they shouted, the rats applauded with theirs 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:59.470
 Noah's paws and his wife for joy 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:04.330
 they started dancing on the bridge 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:06.340
 at the end the hole was plugged the 

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:09.340
 rain falls for forty days e 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:12.340
 forty nights and the ocean was extinguished 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:15.160
 how far the dog's gaze came 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:18.160
 noah could do nothing but stay 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:21.180
 always there he felt that his master was 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:23.740
 he wanted where he was with his nose in the hole 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:27.160
 the water beat on the ship night e 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:30.100
 day but not a single goal center 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:35.130
 finally a nice morning the dog 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:35.130
 you smell something different 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:42.870
 out through the fog yes 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:45.570
 he could see a big mountain and behind it 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:48.810
 a little peeped out of it 

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:51.240
 blue wedge finally stopped 

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:53.910
 to rain and a magnificent one appeared 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:59.430
 rainbow that crossed the sky from 

00:04:53.910 --> 00:05:02.520
 east to west arrived and who magnificent 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:06.920
 show on earth once again 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:06.920
 all sorts of things had grown 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:15.419
 my dog ​​is waiting for my dear friend 

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:18.060
 my mingo dog died good 

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:21.350
 boy think and stroking 

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:25.080
 gently wars the dog's belly 

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:27.300
 answered the dog is a leap for worse 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:31.590
 kiss his master with his 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:34.620
 wet nose he no longer went by sea but 

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:38.360
 since then the dogs' nose has become 

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:38.360
 cold and wet
