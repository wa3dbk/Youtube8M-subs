and dagger so one may hint that there

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.549 
and dagger so one may hint that there
could<00:01:00.510> be<00:01:00.539> a<00:01:00.690> possible<00:01:01.140> cloak<00:01:01.379> and<00:01:01.500> dagger

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
could be a possible cloak and dagger

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.630 
could be a possible cloak and dagger
movie<00:01:02.329> coming<00:01:03.329> shortly<00:01:03.780> and<00:01:04.129> we<00:01:05.129> all<00:01:05.280> heard

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
movie coming shortly and we all heard

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.359 
movie coming shortly and we all heard
things<00:01:06.390> about<00:01:06.780> Doctor<00:01:07.380> Strange<00:01:07.439> movie<00:01:07.799> as

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
things about Doctor Strange movie as

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.730 
things about Doctor Strange movie as
well<00:01:08.760> so<00:01:09.240> there's<00:01:10.170> a<00:01:10.229> reason<00:01:10.560> why<00:01:10.680> these

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
well so there's a reason why these

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.770 
well so there's a reason why these
characters<00:01:11.460> are<00:01:11.610> being<00:01:11.820> thrown<00:01:12.090> into<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:12.600> mix

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
characters are being thrown into the mix

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.630 
characters are being thrown into the mix
here<00:01:13.110> and<00:01:13.140> it<00:01:13.439> seems<00:01:13.680> like<00:01:14.010> by<00:01:14.220> the<00:01:14.340> time<00:01:14.369> you

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
here and it seems like by the time you

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.249 
here and it seems like by the time you
get<00:01:14.790> to<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:15.030> end<00:01:15.210> in<00:01:15.360> this<00:01:15.450> episode<00:01:15.960> that

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
get to the end in this episode that

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.350 
get to the end in this episode that
possibly<00:01:16.950> cloak<00:01:17.220> and<00:01:17.369> dagger<00:01:17.430> may<00:01:18.090> have<00:01:18.330> a

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
possibly cloak and dagger may have a

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.840 
possibly cloak and dagger may have a
bigger<00:01:18.600> picture<00:01:18.869> down<00:01:19.860> the<00:01:20.100> line<00:01:20.310> in<00:01:20.640> this

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:11.610 
episode that I'm looking forward to

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:14.569 
episode that I'm looking forward to
that's<00:04:11.940> supposedly<00:04:12.269> 2<00:04:13.140> hours<00:04:13.560> or<00:04:13.799> why<00:04:13.950> not

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:14.579 
that's supposedly 2 hours or why not

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:17.180 
that's supposedly 2 hours or why not
so<00:04:14.989> overall<00:04:15.989> though<00:04:16.350> I'm<00:04:16.620> going<00:04:16.769> to<00:04:16.859> give<00:04:16.979> this

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
so overall though I'm going to give this

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:20.900 
so overall though I'm going to give this
episode<00:04:17.760> probably<00:04:18.060> about<00:04:18.540> three<00:04:19.760> three<00:04:20.760> and<00:04:20.790> a

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:20.910 
episode probably about three three and a

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:23.420 
episode probably about three three and a
half<00:04:21.090> out<00:04:21.269> of<00:04:21.390> five<00:04:21.510> stars<00:04:22.140> I've<00:04:22.740> seen<00:04:23.130> better

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 
half out of five stars I've seen better

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:26.790 
half out of five stars I've seen better
I<00:04:23.550> like<00:04:23.849> the<00:04:23.970> venom<00:04:24.270> episode<00:04:24.720> better<00:04:25.220> and

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:26.800 
I like the venom episode better and

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:28.860 
I like the venom episode better and
I<00:04:26.860> think<00:04:27.190> so<00:04:27.370> far<00:04:27.610> I<00:04:27.639> probably<00:04:27.970> know<00:04:28.210> the<00:04:28.629> worst

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:28.870 
I think so far I probably know the worst

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:30.450 
I think so far I probably know the worst
episode<00:04:29.199> of<00:04:29.470> the<00:04:29.530> season<00:04:29.740> so<00:04:30.009> far<00:04:30.069> was

00:04:33.119 --> 00:04:33.129 
actually those first two episodes with

00:04:33.129 --> 00:04:35.550
