00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:17.910 
I think what it really is is you really

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:20.090 
I think what it really is is you really
plan<00:01:18.300> an<00:01:18.930> evening<00:01:19.080> of<00:01:19.500> entertainment<00:01:19.590> you

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.340 
really think about the running order and

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.910 
really think about the running order and
which<00:01:23.340> songs<00:01:23.880> really<00:01:24.300> allow<00:01:24.720> you<00:01:24.780> to<00:01:24.960> break

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
which songs really allow you to break

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.740 
which songs really allow you to break
away<00:01:26.160> from<00:01:26.340> the<00:01:26.730> traditional<00:01:27.180> way<00:01:27.330> of<00:01:27.480> doing

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
away from the traditional way of doing

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.660 
away from the traditional way of doing
things<00:01:27.990> whether<00:01:28.680> there's<00:01:28.980> room<00:01:29.190> in<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.430> set

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
things whether there's room in the set

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.550 
things whether there's room in the set
for<00:01:29.850> improvising<00:01:30.450> which<00:01:30.930> is<00:01:31.080> why<00:01:31.230> I<00:01:31.260> really

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
for improvising which is why I really
