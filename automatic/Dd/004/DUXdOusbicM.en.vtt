00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:30.230 
map that I made and I'm using a mod that

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:32.409 
map that I made and I'm using a mod that

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:36.890 
it's like zai mocks I probably

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:39.520 
it's like zai mocks I probably
definitely<00:00:37.390> pronounced<00:00:38.390> that<00:00:38.450> wrong<00:00:38.780> but

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:39.530 
definitely pronounced that wrong but

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:40.840 
definitely pronounced that wrong but
we're<00:00:39.770> just<00:00:39.800> gonna<00:00:40.010> go<00:00:40.219> through<00:00:40.250> this<00:00:40.520> small

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:40.850

we're just gonna go through this small
map<00:00:41.149> I<00:00:41.300> made<00:00:41.329> so<00:00:41.629> you<00:00:41.690> can<00:00:41.750> kind<00:00:41.989> of<00:00:42.079> see<00:00:42.289> how

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:42.890 
map I made so you can kind of see how

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.069 
map I made so you can kind of see how
night<00:00:43.430> lighting<00:00:43.820> works<00:00:44.030> in<00:00:44.360> the<00:00:44.510> game<00:00:44.690> so<00:00:44.960> we

00:00:45.069 --> 00:00:45.079 
night lighting works in the game so we

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:47.229 
night lighting works in the game so we
have<00:00:45.199> a<00:00:45.230> small<00:00:45.590> strip<00:00:45.920> of<00:00:46.070> town<00:00:46.340> I<00:00:46.610> added<00:00:47.120> some

out there today there's Daisy and then

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:15.130 
out there today there's Daisy and then
unturned<00:01:13.130> a<00:01:13.430> lot<00:01:13.909> of<00:01:14.000> them<00:01:14.119> don't<00:01:14.570> have<00:01:14.780> lights

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.140 
unturned a lot of them don't have lights

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:16.929 
unturned a lot of them don't have lights
in<00:01:15.290> them<00:01:15.439> they<00:01:15.680> just<00:01:15.710> it's<00:01:16.219> complete<00:01:16.579> darkness

00:01:16.929 --> 00:01:16.939 
in them they just it's complete darkness

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:18.399 
in them they just it's complete darkness
at<00:01:17.210> night<00:01:17.360> no<00:01:17.630> matter<00:01:17.750> if<00:01:17.930> you're<00:01:18.020> in<00:01:18.110> a<00:01:18.200> town

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:18.409 
at night no matter if you're in a town

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:21.039 
at night no matter if you're in a town
or<00:01:18.740> in<00:01:18.890> the<00:01:19.310> woods<00:01:19.520> no<00:01:19.700> matter<00:01:19.850> what<00:01:20.060> it<00:01:20.179> is<00:01:20.299> so

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:21.049 
or in the woods no matter what it is so

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:23.469 
or in the woods no matter what it is so
I<00:01:21.380> think<00:01:22.130> that's<00:01:22.399> kind<00:01:22.609> of<00:01:22.700> a<00:01:22.789> cool<00:01:22.939> idea<00:01:23.270> but

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:23.479 
I think that's kind of a cool idea but

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:25.449 
I think that's kind of a cool idea but
at<00:01:23.600> the<00:01:23.689> same<00:01:23.869> time<00:01:24.109> lights<00:01:24.889> actually<00:01:25.159> add

00:01:25.449 --> 00:01:25.459 
at the same time lights actually add

00:01:25.459 --> 00:01:27.340 
at the same time lights actually add
like<00:01:25.639> a<00:01:25.729> whole<00:01:25.969> entire<00:01:26.389> new<00:01:26.659> aspect<00:01:27.170> because

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:27.350 
like a whole entire new aspect because

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:29.169 
like a whole entire new aspect because
you<00:01:27.439> have<00:01:27.619> to<00:01:27.740> have<00:01:27.829> a<00:01:27.889> lot<00:01:28.069> more<00:01:28.100> strategy<00:01:29.060> if

00:01:29.169 --> 00:01:29.179 
you have to have a lot more strategy if

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:30.399 
you have to have a lot more strategy if
you<00:01:29.209> think<00:01:29.420> about<00:01:29.600> it<00:01:29.749> you<00:01:29.810> can't<00:01:30.020> just<00:01:30.200> walk

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:30.409 
you think about it you can't just walk

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:32.769 
you think about it you can't just walk
into<00:01:30.590> a<00:01:30.679> town<00:01:30.979> anymore<00:01:31.219> so<00:01:31.639> if<00:01:31.969> I<00:01:32.270> was<00:01:32.450> to<00:01:32.600> walk

00:01:32.769 --> 00:01:32.779 
into a town anymore so if I was to walk

00:01:32.779 --> 00:01:35.169 
into a town anymore so if I was to walk
up<00:01:33.020> onto<00:01:33.229> this<00:01:33.529> hill<00:01:33.709> you<00:01:34.670> can<00:01:34.789> see<00:01:34.939> here's<00:01:35.119> the

00:01:35.169 --> 00:01:35.179 
up onto this hill you can see here's the

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:37.179 
up onto this hill you can see here's the
residential<00:01:35.779> area<00:01:36.020> just<00:01:36.229> a<00:01:36.319> few<00:01:36.499> houses<00:01:36.709> I

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:39.619 
didn't add furniture in those but if you

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:44.689 
first time you have to think about how

snipers<00:01:49.700> around<00:01:49.729> they<00:01:50.209> can<00:01:50.359> see<00:01:50.569> you<00:01:50.749> a<00:01:50.779> lot

00:01:51.309 --> 00:01:51.319 
snipers around they can see you a lot

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:52.959 
snipers around they can see you a lot
easier<00:01:51.920> at<00:01:52.069> night<00:01:52.099> so<00:01:52.340> you're<00:01:52.429> gonna<00:01:52.549> have<00:01:52.849> to

00:01:52.959 --> 00:01:52.969 
easier at night so you're gonna have to

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:55.929 
easier at night so you're gonna have to
say<00:01:53.149> hmm<00:01:53.810> I'm<00:01:53.959> gonna<00:01:54.139> go<00:01:54.770> from<00:01:55.130> that<00:01:55.579> wall

00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:55.939 
say hmm I'm gonna go from that wall

00:01:55.939 --> 00:01:57.760 
say hmm I'm gonna go from that wall
where<00:01:56.149> it's<00:01:56.270> dark<00:01:56.599> maybe<00:01:57.170> go<00:01:57.380> all<00:01:57.560> the<00:01:57.649> way

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
where it's dark maybe go all the way

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.039 
where it's dark maybe go all the way
around<00:01:58.069> and<00:01:58.189> stay<00:01:58.429> like<00:01:59.389> out<00:01:59.659> of<00:01:59.840> the<00:01:59.899> way<00:02:00.020> of

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:00.049 
around and stay like out of the way of

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:01.629 
around and stay like out of the way of
the<00:02:00.259> lights<00:02:00.469> and<00:02:00.740> then<00:02:00.859> go<00:02:01.099> to<00:02:01.159> the<00:02:01.369> back<00:02:01.609> of

00:02:01.629 --> 00:02:01.639 
the lights and then go to the back of

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:03.489 
the lights and then go to the back of
the<00:02:01.880> clothing<00:02:02.240> store<00:02:02.359> you<00:02:02.929> have<00:02:02.959> to<00:02:03.109> think<00:02:03.380> a

00:02:03.489 --> 00:02:03.499 
the clothing store you have to think a

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:05.739 
the clothing store you have to think a
lot<00:02:03.649> differently<00:02:04.189> a<00:02:04.219> lot<00:02:04.490> harder<00:02:04.759> and<00:02:05.149> overall

00:02:05.739 --> 00:02:05.749 
lot differently a lot harder and overall

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:07.809 
lot differently a lot harder and overall
adding<00:02:06.079> lights<00:02:06.349> even<00:02:07.039> though<00:02:07.340> it's<00:02:07.639> scary

00:02:07.809 --> 00:02:07.819 
adding lights even though it's scary

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:10.180 
adding lights even though it's scary
when<00:02:08.209> it's<00:02:08.330> dark<00:02:08.599> actually<00:02:09.590> adds<00:02:09.770> a<00:02:09.920> whole<00:02:10.039> new

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
when it's dark actually adds a whole new

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:12.040 
when it's dark actually adds a whole new
level<00:02:10.220> of<00:02:10.670> strategy<00:02:11.060> and<00:02:11.599> here's<00:02:11.900> this

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
level of strategy and here's this

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:14.470 
level of strategy and here's this
mansion<00:02:12.319> up<00:02:12.560> here<00:02:12.770> I<00:02:12.950> didn't<00:02:13.610> get<00:02:13.700> time<00:02:13.940> to<00:02:14.000> add

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
mansion up here I didn't get time to add

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.600 
mansion up here I didn't get time to add
any<00:02:15.380> furniture<00:02:15.860> in<00:02:15.950> here<00:02:16.040> so<00:02:16.190> it's<00:02:16.310> not<00:02:16.400> that

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
a link to it in the description but

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.300 
a link to it in the description but
there's<00:02:41.660> also<00:02:41.870> a<00:02:42.080> new<00:02:42.590> version<00:02:42.830> that<00:02:43.070> was<00:02:43.130> just

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
there's also a new version that was just

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:44.890 
there's also a new version that was just
added<00:02:43.490> like<00:02:43.730> 30<00:02:44.090> minutes<00:02:44.360> ago<00:02:44.540> while<00:02:44.840> I<00:02:44.870> was

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
added like 30 minutes ago while I was

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.170 
added like 30 minutes ago while I was
making<00:02:45.080> this<00:02:45.320> video<00:02:45.590> so<00:02:45.680> kind<00:02:46.520> of<00:02:46.610> bad<00:02:46.820> timing

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
making this video so kind of bad timing

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.210 
making this video so kind of bad timing
but<00:02:47.450> I've<00:02:47.570> added<00:02:47.780> basically<00:02:48.530> flickering

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
but I've added basically flickering

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:50.680 
but I've added basically flickering
lights<00:02:49.490> which<00:02:49.700> i<00:02:49.790> think<00:02:49.850> is<00:02:50.090> a<00:02:50.120> really<00:02:50.510> cool

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:50.690 
lights which i think is a really cool

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:52.720 
lights which i think is a really cool
idea<00:02:50.810> and<00:02:51.470> it'd<00:02:51.800> be<00:02:51.830> even<00:02:52.130> more<00:02:52.280> interesting

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
idea and it'd be even more interesting

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:55.150 
idea and it'd be even more interesting
if<00:02:52.820> they<00:02:52.940> added<00:02:53.270> oh<00:02:53.960> shit<00:02:54.650> this<00:02:54.740> is<00:02:54.890> a<00:02:54.920> really

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:55.160 
if they added oh shit this is a really

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.300 
if they added oh shit this is a really
thick<00:02:55.400> stuff<00:02:55.670> right<00:02:55.940> here<00:02:56.290> hmm<00:02:57.290> it'd<00:02:58.160> be

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 
thick stuff right here hmm it'd be

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:00.310 
thick stuff right here hmm it'd be
interesting<00:02:58.490> if<00:02:58.820> they<00:02:58.970> added<00:02:59.300> like<00:02:59.510> a<00:02:59.660> 70%

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:00.320 
interesting if they added like a 70%

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:01.840 
interesting if they added like a 70%
chance<00:03:00.710> of<00:03:00.920> the<00:03:01.040> light<00:03:01.190> working<00:03:01.550> that<00:03:01.700> way

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:01.850 
chance of the light working that way

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:03.310 
chance of the light working that way
you'd<00:03:02.000> have<00:03:02.120> areas<00:03:02.570> where<00:03:02.600> it's<00:03:02.900> dark<00:03:03.140> and

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:03.320 
you'd have areas where it's dark and

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:05.410 
you'd have areas where it's dark and
light<00:03:03.530> but<00:03:04.010> here's<00:03:04.220> the<00:03:04.400> barn<00:03:04.970> and<00:03:05.240> you<00:03:05.300> can

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420 
light but here's the barn and you can

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:06.820 
light but here's the barn and you can
see<00:03:05.540> just<00:03:05.630> how<00:03:05.720> interesting<00:03:06.320> it<00:03:06.410> is<00:03:06.500> to<00:03:06.710> be

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:06.830 
see just how interesting it is to be

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:08.560 
see just how interesting it is to be
looting<00:03:07.520> at<00:03:07.640> night<00:03:07.820> if<00:03:07.940> you<00:03:08.030> were<00:03:08.120> in<00:03:08.240> a<00:03:08.330> full

server game with zombies and all that

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:12.190 
server game with zombies and all that
stuff<00:03:10.670> it<00:03:11.270> would<00:03:11.330> be<00:03:11.480> a<00:03:11.510> lot<00:03:11.720> more<00:03:11.870> interesting

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
stuff it would be a lot more interesting
