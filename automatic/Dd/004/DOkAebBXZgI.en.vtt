but make sure you use dry rag because it
easier<00:01:09.420> to<00:01:09.510> work<00:01:09.689> with<00:01:09.750> than<00:01:10.500> a<00:01:10.560> webknight<00:01:10.890> so

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
easier to work with than a webknight so

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.899 
easier to work with than a webknight so
you<00:01:12.270> just<00:01:12.450> bend<00:01:12.810> bend<00:01:13.260> your<00:01:13.500> um<00:01:13.710> your<00:01:14.430> hanger

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
you just bend bend your um your hanger

carnival I have this waterless coolant

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:06.920 
carnival I have this waterless coolant
I'm<00:03:05.130> gonna<00:03:05.310> be<00:03:05.459> putting<00:03:05.760> the<00:03:05.970> I'm<00:03:06.570> gonna<00:03:06.750> be

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.759 
I'm gonna be putting the I'm gonna be
using<00:03:07.110> now<00:03:07.380> from<00:03:07.739> now<00:03:07.890> so<00:03:08.549> I<00:03:08.820> just<00:03:09.750> saw<00:03:09.959> drain

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:10.769 
using now from now so I just saw drain

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:17.509 
using now from now so I just saw drain
the<00:03:11.720> my<00:03:13.459> radiator<00:03:14.459> and<00:03:15.030> all<00:03:15.920> you<00:03:16.920> know<00:03:17.040> float

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519 
the my radiator and all you know float

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:19.160 
the my radiator and all you know float
that<00:03:17.790> was<00:03:18.000> enough<00:03:18.299> believe<00:03:18.540> that<00:03:18.720> was<00:03:18.840> a<00:03:18.870> flu

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
that was enough believe that was a flu

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.140 
that was enough believe that was a flu
that<00:03:19.320> wasn't<00:03:19.680> it<00:03:19.799> from<00:03:20.190> you<00:03:20.700> know<00:03:20.820> when<00:03:21.030> the

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
that wasn't it from you know when the

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.410 
that wasn't it from you know when the
car<00:03:22.160> from<00:03:23.160> the<00:03:23.340> original<00:03:23.790> owner<00:03:23.970> and<00:03:24.120> I<00:03:24.239> don't

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
car from the original owner and I don't

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.780 
car from the original owner and I don't
think<00:03:24.630> they<00:03:24.750> ever<00:03:24.840> did<00:03:25.110> a<00:03:25.310> you<00:03:26.310> know<00:03:26.430> change

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
think they ever did a you know change

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:29.990 
think they ever did a you know change
the<00:03:26.880> coolant<00:03:27.330> so<00:03:28.370> and<00:03:29.370> I<00:03:29.489> should<00:03:29.730> have<00:03:29.820> done

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
the coolant so and I should have done

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.940 
the coolant so and I should have done
this<00:03:30.120> a<00:03:30.299> while<00:03:30.330> ago<00:03:30.540> so

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950
