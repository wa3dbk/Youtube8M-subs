away and you come back and dig all these
out<00:01:34.470> dig<00:01:35.070> around<00:01:35.220> the<00:01:35.460> base<00:01:35.640> of<00:01:35.850> each<00:01:35.909> one<00:01:36.180> and

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.130 
out dig around the base of each one and

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:40.399 
out dig around the base of each one and
until<00:01:38.130> you<00:01:38.220> hear<00:01:38.520> all<00:01:38.640> the<00:01:38.820> roots<00:01:39.060> break<00:01:39.409> and

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
until you hear all the roots break and

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.170 
until you hear all the roots break and
you<00:01:40.560> pull<00:01:40.740> those<00:01:40.920> out<00:01:41.070> easily<00:01:41.310> so<00:01:41.880> it'll<00:01:42.119> be

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
you pull those out easily so it'll be

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.910 
you pull those out easily so it'll be
much<00:01:42.360> easier<00:01:42.390> now<00:01:42.840> with<00:01:42.990> my<00:01:43.170> shovel<00:01:43.380> down<00:01:43.649> here

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
much easier now with my shovel down here

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.969 
much easier now with my shovel down here
to<00:01:44.490> do<00:01:44.610> that<00:01:44.759> next<00:01:44.909> step<00:01:45.409> next<00:01:46.409> go<00:01:46.619> out<00:01:46.740> your

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
to do that next step next go out your

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.760 
to do that next step next go out your
box<00:01:47.100> with<00:01:47.399> all<00:01:47.430> the<00:01:47.759> way<00:01:47.909> around<00:01:48.590> digging<00:01:49.590> up

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
box with all the way around digging up

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.770 
box with all the way around digging up
the<00:01:49.920> roots<00:01:50.149> get<00:01:51.149> them<00:01:51.299> to<00:01:51.450> pop

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:52.780 
the roots get them to pop

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.550 
the roots get them to pop
breaking<00:01:53.770> them<00:01:53.890> and<00:01:54.070> then<00:01:54.580> now<00:01:55.290> things<00:01:56.290> popped

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560 
breaking them and then now things popped

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.740 
breaking them and then now things popped
out<00:01:56.710> of<00:01:56.740> ground<00:01:57.010> easily<00:01:57.400> and<00:01:57.910> just<00:01:58.090> all<00:01:58.690> that

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:58.750 
out of ground easily and just all that

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:03.000 
out of ground easily and just all that
off<00:01:59.050> with<00:01:59.320> my<00:01:59.670> branches<00:02:01.440> Sal<00:02:02.440> there<00:02:02.590> is<00:02:02.680> to<00:02:02.830> it

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:03.010 
off with my branches Sal there is to it
