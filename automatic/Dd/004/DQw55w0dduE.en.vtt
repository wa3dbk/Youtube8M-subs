00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:11.370
 There, there, people, you think this is for 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.469
 but a commented video gameplay and 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.350
 Today's video is about call of duty 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.310
 black ops 11 we will not go there 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.560
 talk about 2 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.170
 today the subject is good to background gameplay 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.750
 you are also seeing p1 and I want 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.970
 tell you about the game because I 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.580
 I'm coming back to play ball glasses one 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:32.579
 Well, I told you that. 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.110
 in a recent stf video was the last 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.940
 episode that owns rpg 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.800
 I had commented that I was with 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.690
 willingness to perform the server I 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.340
 had on the block pc album for guys 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.200
 return to play there myself again 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.969
 play because I have a lot of desire to 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.340
 play the South Cup and there is no more server 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.559
 dr nuno lopes onu because I think that as 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.840
 it you know the botox one of perception 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.520
 servers and is different from 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.829
 how does it work in black ops two blocks 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.360
 as exists in server listing ie 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.129
 you against the servers themselves 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.739
 players can buy the servers in the 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:04.260
 case and then the servers will appear in 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.760
 a list of several servers ok you can 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.930
 choose any you want to get into 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.520
 any time you want 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.830
 sure and had no other server 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.150
 Brazilian is the game also abandoned and 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.920
 Turn around and I feel like playing 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.930
 ball and glasses 1 and I remember that in the year 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.909
 I did not like it either. 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.110
 will at the end of its useful life 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.110
 of the game more or less at that time 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:24.180
 even July so more or less and then I 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.619
 I rented a server there right I bought 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.450
 a server to the galera can play 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.130
 put the hashi server name and was a 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.450
 success the guys like hell in 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.280
 time comes the place of the servers 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.750
 because I was fighting a server a lot 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.549
 and there were lots of people wanting to play 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.600
 We could then spoke place notes 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:40.320
 why not 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:42.210
 and then they went to the site server and this year 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.890
 I feel like coming back 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.540
 black ops a game that I like to 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.310
 Hell, I think multiplayer 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.649
 Dude I get so divided I do not know if 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.600
 I like code 4 more than black sun 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:53.280
 in multiplayer mode more honestly 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.659
 I'm back to playing the Serbian today. 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.950
 rented again will explain everything 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.630
 Right for you 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.670
 and then I went back to play and I do not know, boy. 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.079
 lopes one is still the game that moves more 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.329
 with me I think that's the best I get 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:04.079
 in the multiplayer better even than in the code 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.759
 4 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:07.770
 but anyway what is the purpose of this video 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:10.080
 just to let you know that yes 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.790
 x-ray server is back what today 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.950
 even I asked there on twitter more 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.270
 early to guys if they'd play your co 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.160
 term of new servers to galera 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:19.440
 would support would download the game would buy 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.239
 maybe even and most answered 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.950
 that yes in response nor positive then 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:25.080
 I was going to the server, it's not very expensive, I guess. 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.420
 That I paid 25 dollars for him to stay. 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.769
 rented for a month is not so cheap but 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.120
 also that it is not so expensive is a 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:31.890
 cool fun that I came back not only 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.120
 for me but also with you not the 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:36.000
 then I think it's worth it 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.380
 if the server is doing fine and I 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.980
 I still want to play you 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.480
 also 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.400
 I rent for longer also 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.650
 Suddenly until the release of the code t's 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:46.080
 last year in community three craft 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.790
 alonguei I rented it for about four 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:51.569
 months I think four or five months of 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:53.370
 June until the launch of dops 2 right and 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:54.930
 maybe I will not do the same thing but 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.329
 this video but just to invite 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.760
 you to go back to playing black ops 1 and 

00:02:57.329 --> 00:03:02.790
 You who do not play on the pc will play too. 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:04.349
 on playstation 3 and xbox 360 is I do not know 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:05.940
 How are you guys playing these two? 

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:07.560
 platform but I believe it is not 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.280
 Well, the consoles always have more 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.660
 players 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.849
 Actually, on Playstation 3 I have one 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:13.110
 Notion that you have a player, yes, because you will 

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:14.670
 and move I 'm talking to you 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:16.019
 with for example from skype the people 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:19.079
 speak we will throw a cup we will 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:20.760
 play the south cup on ps3 right and it always has 

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:22.709
 Dear people, there are always people there to 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.510
 to play we always find room not so 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:26.609
 easily and more think health br 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:28.049
 quiet has efe met so it's quite good 

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:29.880
 You can find out even dominate chan. 

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:31.440
 Ok it's obvious that in live, it's not 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:33.329
 different must have people playing too 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.769
 so if you have block 1 enjoy 

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:36.239
 because it 's a really cool game, I think it's worth it 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:38.489
 It's really worth your while to remember again. 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:39.900
 a little old pictures whenever 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:41.609
 always play the same game every time 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:43.290
 it is neither a matter of the game to be 

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:44.910
 good or bad in the current game in case 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:47.160
 I banked after the matter really sick 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:48.959
 the face of the last 3 years was thus in the 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.639
 block was so I also remember that in the 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:53.010
 backoffice I went straight back to 

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:55.049
 play 4 you know so I 'm 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:56.639
 inviting you to play there do not you think 

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:58.980
 Okay, it's just you opening the game is the way 

00:03:56.639 --> 00:04:00.750
 multiplayer stay there on play server 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:03.000
 browser and and will have the list 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:04.410
 if you have not find my server is 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.130
 only you have the list organized by 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:07.440
 ping 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:08.880
 ok who will appear at the top the 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:10.769
 servers with better pim in the case of 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:12.090
 Brazil servers and I only have mine 

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:14.010
 I think there's another side to be 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:16.950
 Minister or else you will find 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:18.870
 right on the server is running only 40 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:21.329
 that software only has no game 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:23.099
 hardcore and are running multiple 

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:23.580
 game modes is running end df net 

00:04:23.099 --> 00:04:25.770
 demolish 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:28.680
 Your name did not even flag free-for-all. 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:30.120
 giving several modes fit up to 18 players 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:32.849
 which then it is like degree donating 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:35.340
 always ok ways 83 give enough people 

00:04:32.849 --> 00:04:37.050
 play and tetÃ©u has even some 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:39.539
 nice features you can do 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:40.770
 some ok commands treat some 

00:04:39.539 --> 00:04:42.689
 features within the 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:44.729
 server is pretty cool and is as follows 

00:04:42.689 --> 00:04:46.979
 way do you know that there is a 

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:48.840
 chat is you can push have there and you 

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:50.669
 You can type in the chat for everyone to read 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:53.370
 what are you typing if you type 

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:56.129
 the exclamation command top steps by 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:57.810
 example will appear the ranking of the two 

00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:59.819
 Guys who have more film than 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:02.699
 they killed a ray x server 

00:04:59.819 --> 00:05:04.289
 sure looks like the top and a top 2.3.4 top 5 

00:05:02.699 --> 00:05:05.580
 and the number that the ones they have 

00:05:04.289 --> 00:05:07.229
 if you press for example if you 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:10.349
 typing for example is inflammation 

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:12.750
 sketches will only appear just for you 

00:05:10.349 --> 00:05:14.310
 there is already information on how many 15 

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:16.919
 those you have had in your car 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:18.150
 front or on the server you know there is a 

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:20.159
 command or if I'm not mistaken it's called 

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:22.229
 information next mep you can do 

00:05:20.159 --> 00:05:23.759
 see which is next to come then 

00:05:22.229 --> 00:05:25.409
 has several nice commands that you 

00:05:23.759 --> 00:05:27.180
 may be using this to happen 

00:05:25.409 --> 00:05:29.250
 through one of a r with which what 

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:30.990
 uses that is a is basically a 

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:33.060
 here you can configure 

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:34.289
 a server and whenever it is open 

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:35.699
 here on my pc 

00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:37.620
 these commands are working then 

00:05:35.699 --> 00:05:39.389
 it is not working 100% in the brain 

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:41.819
 because when you turn off your computer 

00:05:39.389 --> 00:05:42.839
 ok is this command to go back to the fla then 

00:05:41.819 --> 00:05:44.699
 I think if you're doing 

00:05:42.839 --> 00:05:46.050
 while my computer off does not 

00:05:44.699 --> 00:05:47.729
 I will tell the ranking for example and 

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:49.710
 but you do not have to stay connected almost 

00:05:47.729 --> 00:05:51.120
 full day several times in the morning 

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:53.310
 also leaves it connected to the pavilion 

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:55.020
 render video then anyway 

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:56.550
 in the vast majority of the time, and errs 

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:58.800
 how it is working and the commands do not 

00:05:56.550 --> 00:06:01.319
 is running then go there run 

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:03.389
 kills pretty much participates in the top rank there 

00:06:01.319 --> 00:06:04.800
 that you will be seen all over the world 

00:06:03.389 --> 00:06:06.839
 as the guy who did the most that the 

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:09.000
 server is another thing there are two 

00:06:06.839 --> 00:06:11.909
 restrictions what is this also comes is from 

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.440
 r with if you use the second chance 

00:06:11.909 --> 00:06:16.560
 goalkeeper lauro you'll take it here 

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:17.969
 automatic or in colatine two 

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:20.219
 chances you use it once it will 

00:06:17.969 --> 00:06:21.629
 give a warning you can not use this and if 

00:06:20.219 --> 00:06:23.610
 you use it again you will take what is 

00:06:21.629 --> 00:06:26.129
 sure that you are subject to the 

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:27.960
 banishment to continue using what 

00:06:26.129 --> 00:06:29.550
 So I 'll let you know 

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:31.469
 and that's it, but then you 

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:32.789
 go there plays these companies are seeing 

00:06:31.469 --> 00:06:34.620
 have already been paid 

00:06:32.789 --> 00:06:37.090
 today side but serving is already
