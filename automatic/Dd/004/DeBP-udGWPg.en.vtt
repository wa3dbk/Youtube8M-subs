00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:13.480
 video on the canadian apple today 

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:17.070
 I introduce you to an extreme murder and 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:19.750
 Although you can with the motto, so to speak 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:22.000
 also took a look through the walls 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:26.140
 or look through the blocks and that 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.539
 activated the necessary then see 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:30.210
 you already here that that that 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:32.230
 clickstream disappears 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.879
 and thinks here is a bit 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:38.670
 stupid best here 

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:41.589
 since the credit and dark is from 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:46.479
 Blind still sees the raw materials there 

00:00:41.589 --> 00:00:50.319
 iron there is coal data is gold and yes 

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:51.489
 the diamond that is the first part away 

00:00:50.319 --> 00:00:53.889
 and if you still have the flyer 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:56.129
 installed you can press it and 

00:00:53.889 --> 00:00:59.409
 then as deep as in Korea 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:03.540
 although he was not in the value of about so 

00:00:59.409 --> 00:01:07.350
 Now I'm going to concrete or 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:09.610
 Let's go in search of diamonds 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.570
 I just look briefly now I would have 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:16.360
 come straight to coal 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:18.550
 right here is a small 11 8 lay 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:23.860
 have to because in new version is 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:26.760
 actually stupid but well to the 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:32.360
 Diamonds, now it's almost iron 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:39.860
 that's the iron here and that 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:44.150
 do you think that man is behind there are some there 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:48.560
 Now a bit far away I go 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:50.660
 just after the okay he is still 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:53.630
 is when it is dark just presses el 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:58.280
 janabi here light without them not 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:02:16.190
 do I need want diamonds 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:18.500
 back there now with the ratios 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:21.170
 on always at even accesses cancer but 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:23.300
 you have to somehow behind it 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:27.280
 everything to come back or because 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:31.280
 otherwise you will be banned paths nothing 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:36.650
 Now comes the coal gold is coming 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:43.190
 they are the same as redstone kreml and that 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:44.660
 diamonds, that's how she hears diamonds 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:46.540
 could now break down normally and 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:50.269
 then go up again 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:53.680
 Well that was it from the motto still celebrating 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:53.680
 the installation for the next time 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:00.500
 I'll show you quickly now 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.960
 he needs the mod installed 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:04.610
 with the flyer murder and in extremo sms 

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:06.890
 Everything is on the side 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:09.140
 that's far is a murder I say now 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:13.220
 times and two like your minecraft 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:15.500
 folder on the bin on the 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:22.460
 human rights click on it opens with 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:23.930
 winrar it's wrong that way and there you can 

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:26.780
 close this here then you have here 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:28.640
 the file so the limit in the whole 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:32.930
 charts and pale part 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:35.230
 then your friend opens folder pulls it 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:35.230
 here one 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:45.040
 opens in extreme murder and looks so too 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:45.040
 again the files purely 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:49.280
 so and now you have the place 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:52.640
 installed that was actually already in the 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:54.849
 installation no hard thing and max 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:54.849
 malsch
