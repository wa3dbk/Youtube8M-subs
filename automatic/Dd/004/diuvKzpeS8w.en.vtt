00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.239
 he is the psychologist today 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.589
 it's your nothing said and I'm sorry 

00:00:03.239 --> 00:00:05.970
 advance anne for example own video 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:07.319
 last week I simply 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:08.370
 leave my place to Catherine who 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:09.840
 do you mean a last goodbye 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.430
 but it's just a goodbye 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.780
 fortunately the theme of the week 

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:14.130
 it's to present you a hairstyle 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.049
 that we do relatively often for 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.730
 go to class personally I do not 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.169
 headdress almost not to go to class 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.060
 so I leave my hair loose 

00:00:19.169 --> 00:00:22.499
 so I will not really be able to 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.210
 introduce you to something innovative 

00:00:22.499 --> 00:00:25.740
 to go to class although I did 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.259
 a lot of hairstyle tutorial on my 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.759
 chain or perso even if I needed 

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:31.050
 of that I can see very well my channel here 

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:33.030
 it's true that I really did not 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.620
 pretty much a lot of water hairstyle if 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.570
 never would you like to have more ideas 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.620
 I invite you to go see that otherwise 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.670
 honestly what I'm going 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.750
 when I have hair that fall in 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.270
 the eyes is that I believe a whole 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.310
 small clip cracks like that and I 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.690
 just join but get away from here 

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:47.910
 because she is the one who falls the most 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.580
 often in the back of my head is managed 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.330
 tie them up with my little clip 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:52.560
 honestly I'm not trying to do 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:54.030
 something static but rather 

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:56.430
 something practical 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.540
 So this is the same town hall 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.520
 especially what pushed me too 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:02.130
 little but well here I want to jatta just 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.540
 3.2 hair behind like that and you 

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:04.969
 know life that it falls in the eyes 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:07.020
 when I try to write something 

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:08.189
 that's it and then the question of 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.499
 his is to tell you what you 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.149
 prefers we're happy sma who so 

00:01:10.499 --> 00:01:14.080
 is what we prefer to do what 

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:16.090
 we love most 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.260
 no i love wearing makeup from my eyes to the 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:18.430
 limit you could very well go out without 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.530
 skin of a good sense I have absolutely 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:23.170
 not go out without fear of a vote either 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:24.490
 I do not care about going out without 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:25.720
 black on the eyes it would be a little 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:28.000
 weird for me 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:30.970
 So no I not feel for not 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.350
 faked my eyes to go out and that's 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:33.880
 really what I prefer to do because 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.500
 that I think it's there we can do 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.210
 the most cool stuff with nuances 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.490
 of colors is all French enough fun 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:41.500
 So here me what I prefer but 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:42.940
 which is it these are the eyes here are the 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.350
 cities so I hope this video 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:45.580
 for despite the fact that it is rather 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:46.810
 short you will have liked 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:47.770
 do not hesitate to tell us in the 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.600
 comments what you would like 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:51.580
 see as theme of the week as 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.780
 question and his teeth are listed 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:54.880
 a lot and it's helping us to make 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:55.810
 lists for the coming weeks so 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.760
 it's much simpler for us 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:58.900
 to organize for girls I am 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:00.610

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:04.060
