where someone passes away in a hot car

00:04:30.789 --> 00:04:39.070 
where someone passes away in a hot car
it's<00:04:31.789> it's<00:04:32.210> tragic<00:04:32.779> when<00:04:32.930> it's<00:04:33.110> so<00:04:33.289> avoidable

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:39.080 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:42.170 

I'm<00:04:40.080> being<00:04:40.530> told<00:04:40.740> that<00:04:41.190> we've<00:04:41.490> we've<00:04:41.819> proved

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:42.180 
I'm being told that we've we've proved

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:43.790 
I'm being told that we've we've proved
the<00:04:42.419> point<00:04:42.629> and<00:04:42.960> I<00:04:43.020> should<00:04:43.199> probably<00:04:43.319> get<00:04:43.650> out

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:43.800 
the point and I should probably get out

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.969 
the point and I should probably get out
of<00:04:43.949> the<00:04:44.009> car<00:04:44.250> so<00:04:44.639> I<00:04:44.909> think<00:04:45.539> we're<00:04:45.930> 20<00:04:46.590> something

00:04:46.969 --> 00:04:46.979 
of the car so I think we're 20 something

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:49.719 
of the car so I think we're 20 something
minutes<00:04:47.009> into<00:04:47.520> this<00:04:47.669> I'm<00:04:48.000> okay

00:04:49.719 --> 00:04:49.729 
minutes into this I'm okay

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:54.350 
minutes into this I'm okay
it's<00:04:50.729> one<00:04:50.819> hundred<00:04:50.940> and<00:04:51.240> one<00:04:53.300> hundred<00:04:54.300> and

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:54.360 
it's one hundred and one hundred and

00:04:54.360 --> 00:05:00.680 
it's one hundred and one hundred and
twenty<00:04:54.690> four<00:04:54.900> point<00:04:55.229> one<00:04:56.300> on<00:04:57.300> the<00:04:59.300> on<00:05:00.300> the<00:05:00.509> side

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:00.690 
twenty four point one on the on the side

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:03.770 
twenty four point one on the on the side
of<00:05:00.750> the<00:05:00.930> door<00:05:01.139> there<00:05:02.419> probably<00:05:03.419> don't<00:05:03.599> want<00:05:03.750> to

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:03.780 
of the door there probably don't want to

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:05.270 
of the door there probably don't want to
touch<00:05:03.960> that<00:05:03.990> while<00:05:04.349> I'm<00:05:04.470> getting<00:05:04.620> out<00:05:04.949> let<00:05:05.190> me

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:05.280 
touch that while I'm getting out let me

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:14.480 
touch that while I'm getting out let me
check<00:05:05.940> the<00:05:06.150> dash<00:05:06.360> here<00:05:06.780> I<00:05:13.190> don't<00:05:14.190> know<00:05:14.370> if

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:14.490 
check the dash here I don't know if

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:16.219 
check the dash here I don't know if
that's<00:05:14.699> right<00:05:15.000> but<00:05:15.330> it<00:05:15.449> says<00:05:15.690> one<00:05:15.870> hundred<00:05:16.139> and

00:05:16.219 --> 00:05:16.229 
that's right but it says one hundred and

00:05:16.229 --> 00:05:18.890 
that's right but it says one hundred and
seventy<00:05:16.590> seven<00:05:16.919> point<00:05:17.129> eight<00:05:17.340> on<00:05:17.550> the<00:05:17.789> dash

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:18.900 
seventy seven point eight on the dash

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:20.839 
seventy seven point eight on the dash
definitely<00:05:19.560> definitely<00:05:19.919> time<00:05:20.280> for<00:05:20.310> me<00:05:20.580> to<00:05:20.699> get

00:05:20.839 --> 00:05:20.849 
definitely definitely time for me to get

00:05:20.849 --> 00:05:22.010 
definitely definitely time for me to get
out<00:05:20.879> of<00:05:21.120> the<00:05:21.180> car

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:22.020 
out of the car

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:25.430 
out of the car
so<00:05:22.500> again<00:05:23.000> 177<00:05:24.000> on<00:05:24.120> the<00:05:24.210> dash<00:05:24.419> I<00:05:24.780> just<00:05:25.259> bought

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:25.440 
so again 177 on the dash I just bought

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:28.129 
so again 177 on the dash I just bought
this<00:05:25.620> today<00:05:25.979> seems<00:05:26.969> like<00:05:27.150> a<00:05:27.180> decent<00:05:27.389> enough

00:05:28.129 --> 00:05:28.139 
this today seems like a decent enough

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:29.869 
this today seems like a decent enough
tool<00:05:28.379> so<00:05:28.680> I'm<00:05:29.099> thinking<00:05:29.460> it<00:05:29.580> should<00:05:29.759> be

00:05:29.869 --> 00:05:29.879 
tool so I'm thinking it should be

00:05:29.879 --> 00:05:32.390 
tool so I'm thinking it should be
accurate<00:05:30.409> so<00:05:31.409> again<00:05:31.740> I'm<00:05:31.949> going<00:05:32.039> to<00:05:32.099> go<00:05:32.280> ahead

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:32.400 
accurate so again I'm going to go ahead

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:34.730 
accurate so again I'm going to go ahead
