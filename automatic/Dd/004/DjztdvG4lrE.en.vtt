00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.540 
another simple little tip it's a
progression<00:02:58.750> of<00:02:59.080> the<00:02:59.170> simple<00:02:59.590> lunge<00:02:59.830> so<00:03:00.400> let's

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:00.550 
progression of the simple lunge so let's

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:02.130 
progression of the simple lunge so let's
get<00:03:00.640> the<00:03:00.760> groundwork<00:03:01.150> set<00:03:01.540> so<00:03:01.780> it's<00:03:01.930> a<00:03:01.990> nice

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140 
get the groundwork set so it's a nice

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.140 
get the groundwork set so it's a nice
long<00:03:02.530> stride<00:03:02.890> back<00:03:03.160> your<00:03:03.490> back<00:03:03.730> heel<00:03:03.970> is<00:03:04.000> up

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150 
long stride back your back heel is up

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.360 
long stride back your back heel is up
both<00:03:04.810> knees<00:03:05.080> are<00:03:05.110> soft<00:03:05.470> and<00:03:05.620> your<00:03:05.740> body<00:03:06.130> weight

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
both knees are soft and your body weight

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:08.880 
both knees are soft and your body weight
is<00:03:06.520> level<00:03:06.940> with<00:03:07.060> straight<00:03:07.630> square<00:03:08.080> hips<00:03:08.410> ready

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:08.890 
is level with straight square hips ready

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:11.400 
is level with straight square hips ready
to<00:03:09.070> lunge<00:03:09.270> so<00:03:10.270> now<00:03:10.420> you<00:03:10.480> have<00:03:10.600> set<00:03:10.810> your<00:03:10.990> abs<00:03:11.230> or

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.410 
to lunge so now you have set your abs or

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:13.350 
to lunge so now you have set your abs or
brace<00:03:11.620> your<00:03:12.010> chest<00:03:12.310> is<00:03:12.489> proud<00:03:12.760> and<00:03:13.000> you're

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.360 
brace your chest is proud and you're

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.420 
brace your chest is proud and you're
dropping<00:03:13.780> down<00:03:13.810> and<00:03:14.290> the<00:03:14.350> little<00:03:14.530> tip<00:03:14.860> is<00:03:15.100> your

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
dropping down and the little tip is your

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:17.250 
dropping down and the little tip is your
front<00:03:15.790> leg<00:03:16.000> you<00:03:16.450> put<00:03:16.630> all<00:03:16.840> the<00:03:17.050> pressure

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
front leg you put all the pressure

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:18.870 
front leg you put all the pressure
through<00:03:17.590> that<00:03:17.739> front<00:03:18.040> here<00:03:18.250> on<00:03:18.430> the<00:03:18.519> upwards

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:18.880 
through that front here on the upwards

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:20.490 
through that front here on the upwards
phase<00:03:19.090> of<00:03:19.269> the<00:03:19.390> lunge<00:03:19.600> and<00:03:19.870> that's<00:03:20.230> really

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
phase of the lunge and that's really

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.979 
phase of the lunge and that's really
going<00:03:20.739> to<00:03:20.800> work<00:03:20.860> that<00:03:21.670> left<00:03:22.000> glute<00:03:22.300> really

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:22.989 
going to work that left glute really

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:23.430 
going to work that left glute really
hard

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:23.440 
hard

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:25.800 
hard
slow<00:03:24.010> it<00:03:24.130> down<00:03:24.190> as<00:03:24.519> much<00:03:24.700> as<00:03:24.760> you<00:03:24.940> can<00:03:25.239> this<00:03:25.630> is

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
slow it down as much as you can this is

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:28.170 
slow it down as much as you can this is
another<00:03:26.110> simple<00:03:26.620> progression<00:03:26.830> if<00:03:27.370> you<00:03:27.970> want

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:28.180 
another simple progression if you want

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:31.199 
another simple progression if you want
to<00:03:28.239> make<00:03:28.360> it<00:03:28.540> even<00:03:28.780> harder<00:03:28.989> take<00:03:29.980> it<00:03:30.130> down<00:03:30.370> even

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:31.209 
to make it even harder take it down even

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:32.460 
to make it even harder take it down even
slower<00:03:31.450> to<00:03:31.720> a<00:03:31.750> right<00:03:32.019> angle

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:32.470 
slower to a right angle

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:34.080 
slower to a right angle
pushing<00:03:33.010> up<00:03:33.130> all<00:03:33.310> the<00:03:33.580> time<00:03:33.790> through<00:03:34.030> that

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.090 
pushing up all the time through that

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:36.750 
pushing up all the time through that
heel<00:03:34.390> and<00:03:34.690> just<00:03:35.070> remember<00:03:36.070> whatever<00:03:36.280> you<00:03:36.580> do

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760

heel and just remember whatever you do
on<00:03:36.790> one<00:03:37.030> side<00:03:37.330> you<00:03:37.870> step<00:03:38.170> through<00:03:38.380> and<00:03:38.709> do

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010 
on one side you step through and do

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:41.040 
on one side you step through and do
exactly<00:03:39.370> the<00:03:39.640> same<00:03:39.850> on<00:03:40.000> the<00:03:40.090> other<00:03:40.120> side<00:03:40.480> so

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:41.050 
exactly the same on the other side so

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:42.780 
exactly the same on the other side so
