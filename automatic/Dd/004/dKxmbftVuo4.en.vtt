00:03:11.259 --> 00:03:11.269 
sticking is perfect but if it's really

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:13.089 
sticking is perfect but if it's really
sticky<00:03:11.510> you<00:03:11.750> can't<00:03:12.049> get<00:03:12.500> your<00:03:12.590> hands<00:03:12.799> off<00:03:12.950> the

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:14.359 
dough then you just add a little bit

00:03:14.359 --> 00:03:17.020 
dough then you just add a little bit
more<00:03:14.480> flour<00:03:14.810> about<00:03:15.319> two<00:03:15.500> more<00:03:15.709> tablespoons<00:03:16.040> so

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 
more flour about two more tablespoons so

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:18.490 
more flour about two more tablespoons so
this<00:03:17.180> dough<00:03:17.420> is<00:03:17.450> perfect<00:03:17.810> because<00:03:18.230> all

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500 
this dough is perfect because all

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.440 
this dough is perfect because all
degrees<00:03:18.980> were<00:03:19.160> at<00:03:19.250> room<00:03:19.430> temperature<00:03:19.940> which

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:20.450 
degrees were at room temperature which

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:23.680 
degrees were at room temperature which
is<00:03:20.569> a<00:03:20.599> key<00:03:20.840> for<00:03:21.019> baking<00:03:22.329> okay<00:03:23.329> so<00:03:23.389> now<00:03:23.599> we're

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:23.690 
is a key for baking okay so now we're

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:25.240 
is a key for baking okay so now we're
going<00:03:23.780> to<00:03:23.840> take<00:03:23.959> an<00:03:24.079> ungreased<00:03:24.500> baking<00:03:24.680> sheet

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250

with a teaspoon I'm gonna just gonna

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:31.330 
with a teaspoon I'm gonna just gonna
take<00:03:28.280> a<00:03:28.310> click<00:03:29.590> pop<00:03:30.590> it<00:03:30.709> down<00:03:30.859> it<00:03:31.040> doesn't<00:03:31.190> have

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 
take a click pop it down it doesn't have

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:33.550 
take a click pop it down it doesn't have
to<00:03:31.430> be<00:03:31.489> perfect<00:03:31.970> this<00:03:32.750> recipe<00:03:32.989> yields<00:03:33.319> about

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.560 
to be perfect this recipe yields about

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:35.319 
to be perfect this recipe yields about
48<00:03:34.250> so<00:03:34.430> you<00:03:34.489> can<00:03:34.579> get<00:03:34.669> a<00:03:34.700> lot<00:03:34.970> in<00:03:35.150> there

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:35.329 
48 so you can get a lot in there

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:37.569 
48 so you can get a lot in there
it's<00:03:35.540> megabyte<00:03:35.840> size<00:03:36.049> it's<00:03:36.950> better<00:03:37.130> bite<00:03:37.340> size

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:37.579 
it's megabyte size it's better bite size

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:44.740 
it's megabyte size it's better bite size
it<00:03:37.790> makes<00:03:37.910> a<00:03:38.000> lot<00:03:38.180> more<00:03:38.209> and<00:03:38.720> then<00:03:43.269> any<00:03:44.269> second

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:44.750 
it makes a lot more and then any second

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:47.050 
it makes a lot more and then any second
you<00:03:44.930> have<00:03:45.139> round<00:03:45.980> or<00:03:46.250> square<00:03:46.400> it's<00:03:46.700> fine<00:03:46.880> to

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.060 
you have round or square it's fine to

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:53.020 
you have round or square it's fine to
use<00:03:51.069> they're<00:03:52.069> not<00:03:52.190> gonna<00:03:52.310> expand<00:03:52.639> too<00:03:52.880> much

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:53.030 
use they're not gonna expand too much

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:54.789 
use they're not gonna expand too much
you<00:03:53.239> can<00:03:53.480> keep<00:03:53.660> them<00:03:53.840> pretty<00:03:54.410> close<00:03:54.590> together

00:03:54.789 --> 00:03:54.799 
you can keep them pretty close together

00:03:54.799 --> 00:03:58.930 
you can keep them pretty close together
but<00:03:55.040> an<00:03:55.160> inch<00:03:55.310> apart<00:03:57.190> so<00:03:58.190> that<00:03:58.220> does<00:03:58.459> it<00:03:58.579> look

00:03:58.930 --> 00:03:58.940 
but an inch apart so that does it look

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:00.099 
but an inch apart so that does it look
like<00:03:59.120> when<00:03:59.269> the<00:03:59.359> cookies<00:03:59.599> are<00:03:59.660> out<00:03:59.840> on<00:03:59.989> the

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:01.400 
front on the baking sheet and I'm just

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.670 
front on the baking sheet and I'm just
gonna<00:04:01.579> take<00:04:01.790> them<00:04:01.910> over<00:04:02.030> to<00:04:02.180> the<00:04:02.269> oven<00:04:02.510> so<00:04:03.379> make

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:07.150 
350 degrees before you put cookies in

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:09.809 
350 degrees before you put cookies in
there<00:04:08.150> you<00:04:08.329> going<00:04:08.510> for

00:04:09.809 --> 00:04:09.819 
there you going for

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:11.849 
there you going for
now<00:04:10.180> chop<00:04:10.450> at<00:04:10.870> around<00:04:11.200> seven<00:04:11.709> or<00:04:11.739> eight

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:11.859 
now chop at around seven or eight

00:04:11.859 --> 00:04:13.380 
now chop at around seven or eight
minutes<00:04:12.159> depending<00:04:12.489> on<00:04:12.579> how<00:04:12.730> strong<00:04:12.790> your<00:04:13.239> of

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:13.390 
minutes depending on how strong your of

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:16.080 
minutes depending on how strong your of
it<00:04:13.420> is<00:04:14.040> so<00:04:15.040> now<00:04:15.159> that<00:04:15.219> gives<00:04:15.519> me<00:04:15.639> cooking<00:04:15.969> for

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:16.090 
it is so now that gives me cooking for

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:18.029 
it is so now that gives me cooking for
about<00:04:16.239> nine<00:04:16.419> minutes<00:04:16.690> or<00:04:17.470> so<00:04:17.620> you<00:04:17.680> take<00:04:17.889> them

00:04:18.029 --> 00:04:18.039 
about nine minutes or so you take them

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:20.189 
about nine minutes or so you take them
out<00:04:18.160> of<00:04:18.190> the<00:04:18.310> oven<00:04:18.630> so<00:04:19.630> they<00:04:19.750> still<00:04:20.049> look

00:04:20.189 --> 00:04:20.199 
out of the oven so they still look

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:23.310 
out of the oven so they still look
really<00:04:20.229> soft<00:04:20.709> on<00:04:20.949> the<00:04:21.070> top<00:04:21.539> but<00:04:22.539> they<00:04:22.810> are

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:23.320 
really soft on the top but they are

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:24.810 
really soft on the top but they are
cooked<00:04:23.650> or<00:04:23.860> you<00:04:23.919> leave<00:04:24.070> them<00:04:24.220> on<00:04:24.310> here

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:24.820 
cooked or you leave them on here

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:27.210 
cooked or you leave them on here
just<00:04:25.090> keep<00:04:25.960> warming<00:04:26.349> up<00:04:26.500> with<00:04:26.680> the<00:04:26.860> hotness<00:04:27.070> of

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:27.220 
just keep warming up with the hotness of

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:29.279 
just keep warming up with the hotness of
the<00:04:27.759> actual<00:04:28.240> pan<00:04:28.449> so<00:04:28.690> they're<00:04:28.810> gonna<00:04:28.930> cook<00:04:29.110> for

00:04:29.279 --> 00:04:29.289 
the actual pan so they're gonna cook for

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:30.629 
the actual pan so they're gonna cook for
