when<00:02:11.420> it<00:02:11.540> opens<00:02:11.840> up<00:02:12.020> I<00:02:12.230> just<00:02:12.440> slid<00:02:12.860> this<00:02:13.010> slider

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
when it opens up I just slid this slider

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.180 
when it opens up I just slid this slider
over<00:02:13.670> this<00:02:14.000> is<00:02:14.180> going<00:02:14.330> to<00:02:14.390> show<00:02:14.450> me<00:02:14.840> the<00:02:15.380> while

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:18.190 
over this is going to show me the while
i'm<00:02:16.340> working<00:02:16.520> on<00:02:16.820> its<00:02:17.000> side<00:02:17.150> and<00:02:17.510> the<00:02:18.050> left

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.840 
i'm working on its side and the left
side<00:02:18.470> is<00:02:18.650> going<00:02:18.800> to<00:02:18.860> be<00:02:18.980> what<00:02:19.370> it's<00:02:19.520> already

done<00:02:20.030> by<00:02:20.240> merging<00:02:20.510> all<00:02:20.810> those<00:02:20.960> photos

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:21.350 
done by merging all those photos

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:24.130 
done by merging all those photos
together<00:02:21.530> so<00:02:22.540> slide<00:02:23.540> this<00:02:23.660> bar<00:02:23.840> all<00:02:23.990> the<00:02:24.020> way

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:25.810 
together so slide this bar all the way
over<00:02:24.500> so<00:02:24.830> I<00:02:24.890> can<00:02:24.980> see<00:02:25.160> what<00:02:25.310> I'm<00:02:25.400> working<00:02:25.430> on

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:25.820 
over so I can see what I'm working on

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:29.380 
over so I can see what I'm working on
and<00:02:26.290> just<00:02:27.290> like<00:02:27.440> the<00:02:28.040> layout<00:02:28.610> is<00:02:28.760> exactly<00:02:29.270> the

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
and just like the layout is exactly the

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:31.210 
and just like the layout is exactly the
same<00:02:29.540> as<00:02:29.600> it<00:02:29.750> was<00:02:30.020> when<00:02:30.500> we<00:02:30.680> were<00:02:30.890> looking<00:02:31.160> at

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
same as it was when we were looking at

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:32.320 
same as it was when we were looking at
it<00:02:31.340> through<00:02:31.430> Lightroom<00:02:31.880> you<00:02:32.030> have<00:02:32.180> your

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:33.830 
presets over here that you could just

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:39.030 
presets over here that you could just
click<00:02:34.070> on<00:02:34.130> and<00:02:34.670> make<00:02:35.210> it<00:02:35.330> look<00:02:35.510> a<00:02:35.600> certain<00:02:35.750> way

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.830 

which<00:02:40.040> that<00:02:40.250> one<00:02:40.370> looks<00:02:40.520> really<00:02:40.760> cool<00:02:40.970> or<00:02:41.330> we

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
which that one looks really cool or we

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.830 
which that one looks really cool or we

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
can go back up to the default one and

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.170 
can go back up to the default one and
play<00:02:45.530> with<00:02:45.680> our<00:02:45.710> sliders<00:02:46.310> over<00:02:46.580> here<00:02:46.820> and<00:02:47.000> mess

with<00:02:47.300> it<00:02:47.360> and<00:02:47.540> do<00:02:47.600> it<00:02:47.690> ourselves<00:02:47.780> I<00:02:48.290> always

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130 
with it and do it ourselves I always

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:50.800 
with it and do it ourselves I always
start<00:02:49.430> right<00:02:49.580> here<00:02:49.610> at<00:02:49.820> method<00:02:50.240> strength<00:02:50.600> and

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
start right here at method strength and

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:52.300 
start right here at method strength and
I'm<00:02:50.870> going<00:02:51.020> to<00:02:51.050> slide<00:02:51.290> this<00:02:51.440> bar<00:02:51.650> way<00:02:51.920> over<00:02:52.160> the

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
I'm going to slide this bar way over the

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:55.390 
I'm going to slide this bar way over the
right<00:02:53.140> the<00:02:54.140> farther<00:02:54.410> over<00:02:54.560> to<00:02:54.920> the<00:02:55.010> right<00:02:55.190> the

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
right the farther over to the right the

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.010 
right the farther over to the right the
more<00:02:55.610> extreme<00:02:56.000> it's<00:02:56.210> going<00:02:56.390> to<00:02:56.510> be<00:02:56.720> and

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:57.020 
more extreme it's going to be and

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:00.100 
more extreme it's going to be and
somewhere<00:02:57.860> around<00:02:58.180> 75<00:02:59.180> to<00:02:59.330> 80<00:02:59.540> is<00:02:59.840> normally

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.110 
somewhere around 75 to 80 is normally

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:02.920 
somewhere around 75 to 80 is normally
where<00:03:00.230> I<00:03:00.290> find<00:03:00.470> myself<00:03:00.650> hanging<00:03:01.010> out<00:03:01.870> now<00:03:02.870> we

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 
where I find myself hanging out now we

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:04.150 
where I find myself hanging out now we
could<00:03:03.170> just<00:03:03.290> come<00:03:03.470> and<00:03:03.620> start<00:03:03.830> playing<00:03:04.070> with

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.160 
could just come and start playing with

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:05.290 
could just come and start playing with
these<00:03:04.250> sliders<00:03:04.550> like<00:03:04.850> right<00:03:05.030> now<00:03:05.180> I<00:03:05.210> think

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:05.300 
these sliders like right now I think

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:08.020 
these sliders like right now I think
it's<00:03:05.480> a<00:03:05.600> little<00:03:05.780> bit<00:03:05.930> overexposed<00:03:06.470> so<00:03:07.030> darken

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
it's a little bit overexposed so darken

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:10.420 
it's a little bit overexposed so darken
it<00:03:08.150> just<00:03:08.390> a<00:03:08.480> little<00:03:08.510> bit<00:03:08.950> and<00:03:09.950> let's<00:03:10.160> go<00:03:10.280> ahead

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.430 
it just a little bit and let's go ahead

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:11.890 
it just a little bit and let's go ahead
and<00:03:10.550> lighten<00:03:10.940> this<00:03:11.060> door<00:03:11.360> right<00:03:11.570> here<00:03:11.630> I'm

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
and lighten this door right here I'm

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:15.730 
and lighten this door right here I'm
going<00:03:12.020> to<00:03:12.110> add<00:03:12.200> a<00:03:12.230> control<00:03:12.560> point<00:03:14.590> affect<00:03:15.590> a

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:15.740 
going to add a control point affect a

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:18.940 
going to add a control point affect a
whole<00:03:16.010> area<00:03:16.220> of<00:03:16.370> the<00:03:16.459> door<00:03:16.670> and<00:03:17.860> lighten<00:03:18.860> that

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:18.950 
whole area of the door and lighten that

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:21.940 
whole area of the door and lighten that
whole<00:03:19.160> area<00:03:20.290> maybe<00:03:21.290> that's<00:03:21.530> a<00:03:21.620> little<00:03:21.650> bit

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 
whole area maybe that's a little bit

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:25.600 
whole area maybe that's a little bit
much<00:03:23.560> you<00:03:24.560> can<00:03:24.650> see<00:03:24.770> as<00:03:24.980> I'm<00:03:25.190> working<00:03:25.310> through

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:25.610 
much you can see as I'm working through

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:27.310 
much you can see as I'm working through
this<00:03:25.700> a<00:03:25.760> lot<00:03:26.120> of<00:03:26.239> trial<00:03:26.600> and<00:03:26.750> error<00:03:26.870> see<00:03:27.170> what

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:27.320 
this a lot of trial and error see what

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:29.979 
this a lot of trial and error see what
you<00:03:27.440> like<00:03:27.590> and<00:03:27.770> what<00:03:27.830> you<00:03:27.920> don't<00:03:28.010> like<00:03:28.780> so<00:03:29.780> from

00:03:29.979 --> 00:03:29.989 
you like and what you don't like so from

you like and what you don't like so from
here<00:03:30.170> you're<00:03:30.320> going<00:03:30.380> to<00:03:30.500> come<00:03:30.770> maybe<00:03:31.400> slide

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:31.580 
here you're going to come maybe slide

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:34.300 
here you're going to come maybe slide
the<00:03:31.700> contrast<00:03:32.239> up<00:03:32.450> up<00:03:32.660> the<00:03:32.810> saturation<00:03:33.650> we're

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:34.310 
the contrast up up the saturation we're

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:36.370 
the contrast up up the saturation we're
not<00:03:34.430> going<00:03:34.670> for<00:03:34.850> a<00:03:34.880> super<00:03:35.270> realistic<00:03:35.750> look<00:03:36.170> as

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:36.380 
not going for a super realistic look as

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:39.280 
not going for a super realistic look as
much<00:03:36.680> as<00:03:36.920> we<00:03:37.130> are<00:03:37.310> an<00:03:37.550> art<00:03:37.850> kind<00:03:38.209> of<00:03:38.300> look<00:03:38.480> the

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:39.290 
much as we are an art kind of look the

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:40.990 
much as we are an art kind of look the
structure<00:03:40.010> again<00:03:40.310> it's<00:03:40.520> going<00:03:40.640> to<00:03:40.700> be<00:03:40.820> more

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:41.000 
structure again it's going to be more

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.610 
structure again it's going to be more
like<00:03:41.060> the<00:03:41.330> high<00:03:41.480> pass<00:03:41.780> kind<00:03:42.110> of<00:03:42.200> thing<00:03:42.380> you<00:03:42.590> see

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620 
like the high pass kind of thing you see

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:45.340 
like the high pass kind of thing you see
if<00:03:42.830> I<00:03:42.920> take<00:03:43.070> it<00:03:43.220> down<00:03:43.870> it's<00:03:44.870> not<00:03:44.989> going<00:03:45.140> to<00:03:45.230> be<00:03:45.320> a

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:45.350 
if I take it down it's not going to be a

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:47.890 
if I take it down it's not going to be a
sharp-looking<00:03:45.890> if<00:03:46.550> I<00:03:47.030> pull<00:03:47.270> it<00:03:47.420> up<00:03:47.600> it's<00:03:47.810> going

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:47.900 
sharp-looking if I pull it up it's going

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:50.890 
sharp-looking if I pull it up it's going
to<00:03:48.020> be<00:03:48.140> a<00:03:48.170> lot<00:03:48.380> more<00:03:48.410> sharp<00:03:48.890> and<00:03:49.100> defined<00:03:49.900> and

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:50.900

somewhere right around there is going to

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:53.770 
somewhere right around there is going to
be<00:03:52.010> about<00:03:52.160> where<00:03:52.550> we're<00:03:52.700> going<00:03:52.850> to<00:03:52.910> be<00:03:53.090> so<00:03:53.630> if<00:03:53.720> i

those<00:03:55.970> settings<00:03:56.390> and<00:03:56.690> open<00:03:57.140> it<00:03:57.230> into

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:57.470 
those settings and open it into

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:01.780 
those settings and open it into
Photoshop<00:03:57.950> and<00:03:59.650> here<00:04:00.650> we<00:04:00.770> are<00:04:00.920> and<00:04:01.220> just<00:04:01.640> so<00:04:01.700> we

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:01.790 
Photoshop and here we are and just so we

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:03.610 
Photoshop and here we are and just so we
can<00:04:01.910> have<00:04:02.150> a<00:04:02.180> before<00:04:02.690> and<00:04:02.810> after<00:04:02.930> kind<00:04:03.290> of<00:04:03.410> shot

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:03.620 
can have a before and after kind of shot

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:06.100 
can have a before and after kind of shot
I'm<00:04:04.070> going<00:04:04.430> to<00:04:04.580> open<00:04:04.790> up<00:04:05.090> the<00:04:05.330> one<00:04:05.540> that<00:04:05.930> my

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:06.110 
I'm going to open up the one that my

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:09.220 
I'm going to open up the one that my
camera<00:04:06.470> said<00:04:06.680> was<00:04:06.860> the<00:04:07.010> correct<00:04:07.340> exposure<00:04:08.230> so

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:09.230 
camera said was the correct exposure so

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:11.840 
camera said was the correct exposure so
we<00:04:09.350> can<00:04:09.530> have<00:04:09.650> something<00:04:09.950> to<00:04:10.370> compare<00:04:10.790> to

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:11.850 
we can have something to compare to

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:13.730 
we can have something to compare to
so<00:04:12.480> this<00:04:12.630> is<00:04:12.720> what<00:04:12.840> my<00:04:12.930> camera<00:04:13.230> said<00:04:13.470> was

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:13.740 
so this is what my camera said was

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:15.230 
so this is what my camera said was
correct<00:04:13.920> and<00:04:14.280> it<00:04:14.340> looks<00:04:14.460> a<00:04:14.550> little<00:04:14.730> bit<00:04:14.910> bright

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:15.240 
correct and it looks a little bit bright

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:16.970 
correct and it looks a little bit bright
if<00:04:15.510> you<00:04:15.660> ask<00:04:15.810> me<00:04:16.020> but<00:04:16.050> I'm<00:04:16.320> sure<00:04:16.470> I'm<00:04:16.590> metering

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:16.980 
if you ask me but I'm sure I'm metering

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:18.440 
if you ask me but I'm sure I'm metering
somewhere<00:04:17.340> over<00:04:17.520> here<00:04:17.550> on<00:04:17.790> the<00:04:17.880> building<00:04:18.240> and

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:18.450 
somewhere over here on the building and

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:21.050 
somewhere over here on the building and
then<00:04:19.200> this<00:04:19.410> is<00:04:19.590> what<00:04:19.770> it<00:04:19.890> looked<00:04:20.040> like<00:04:20.130> after

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 
then this is what it looked like after

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:23.330 
then this is what it looked like after
we<00:04:21.180> HDR<00:04:21.720> did<00:04:21.900> so<00:04:22.350> again<00:04:22.590> that's<00:04:22.710> there<00:04:22.950> before
