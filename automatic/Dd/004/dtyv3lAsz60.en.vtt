three tiddlers will open all three of
those<00:01:59.530> conditions<00:01:59.950> for<00:02:00.430> us<00:02:01.170> so<00:02:02.170> let's<00:02:02.350> go

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:02.620 
those conditions for us so let's go

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:12.460 
those conditions for us so let's go
ahead<00:02:02.650> and<00:02:02.830> do<00:02:03.040> that

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470
