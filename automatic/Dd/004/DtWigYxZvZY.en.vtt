early<00:01:11.790> May<00:01:11.970> Day<00:01:12.210> we<00:01:12.479> were<00:01:12.600> on<00:01:12.750> the<00:01:12.899> river<00:01:13.110> the

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
early May Day we were on the river the

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.830 
early May Day we were on the river the
high<00:01:13.710> for<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.070> day<00:01:14.100> was<00:01:14.460> 94<00:01:15.090> degrees<00:01:15.240> and<00:01:15.750> the

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
high for the day was 94 degrees and the

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.980 
high for the day was 94 degrees and the
water<00:01:16.080> temperature<00:01:16.649> was<00:01:16.680> 58<00:01:17.509> the<00:01:18.509> discharge

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
water temperature was 58 the discharge

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.719 
water temperature was 58 the discharge
from<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.290> Lake<00:01:19.470> Murray<00:01:19.680> Dam<00:01:19.979> was<00:01:20.190> quite<00:01:20.460> low

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
from the Lake Murray Dam was quite low

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.870 
from the Lake Murray Dam was quite low
so<00:01:21.000> the<00:01:21.119> river<00:01:21.300> was<00:01:21.570> primarily<00:01:22.140> very<00:01:22.440> calm

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:22.880 
so the river was primarily very calm

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.490 
so the river was primarily very calm
except<00:01:23.880> for<00:01:24.060> a<00:01:24.090> few<00:01:24.330> Rapids<00:01:24.840> both<00:01:25.080> upstream

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
except for a few Rapids both upstream

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.160 
except for a few Rapids both upstream
and<00:01:25.619> downstream<00:01:26.509> we<00:01:27.509> started<00:01:27.869> by<00:01:27.990> going

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
and downstream we started by going

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.080 
and downstream we started by going
upstream<00:01:28.679> which<00:01:29.039> was<00:01:29.220> not<00:01:29.399> difficult<00:01:29.700> in<00:01:30.000> the

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
upstream which was not difficult in the

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.810 
upstream which was not difficult in the
calm<00:01:30.330> water<00:01:31.100> eventually<00:01:32.100> we<00:01:32.399> worked<00:01:32.640> our<00:01:32.789> way

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
calm water eventually we worked our way

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.210 
calm water eventually we worked our way

I<00:05:10.410> was<00:05:11.040> surprised<00:05:11.460> after<00:05:11.820> a<00:05:11.880> couple<00:05:12.150> of

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:12.210 
I was surprised after a couple of

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:13.700 
I was surprised after a couple of
minutes<00:05:12.540> when<00:05:12.660> Tommy<00:05:12.900> came<00:05:13.230> back<00:05:13.440> from<00:05:13.560> the

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:43.800 
the rapids that jumped out of the water

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:46.580
