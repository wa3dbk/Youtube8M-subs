00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
to utilities and disutilities and make a

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.619 
to utilities and disutilities and make a
new<00:00:44.600> dmg<00:00:45.600> file<00:00:46.489> like<00:00:47.489> their<00:00:47.730> original<00:00:48.090> mafia<00:00:48.480> 2

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
new dmg file like their original mafia 2

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:59.599 
new dmg file like their original mafia 2
data<00:00:49.730> DMV<00:00:50.730> so<00:00:51.239> you<00:00:51.480> name<00:00:51.690> it<00:00:51.840> mafia<00:00:57.920> go<00:00:58.920> make<00:00:59.579> a

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
data DMV so you name it mafia go make a

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:04.460 
data DMV so you name it mafia go make a
guard<00:01:00.079> partition<00:01:01.079> map<00:01:01.430> and<00:01:03.170> then<00:01:04.170> you<00:01:04.379> would

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
guard partition map and then you would

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:10.270 
guard partition map and then you would
have<00:01:04.619> to<00:01:04.769> pick<00:01:05.150> is<00:01:06.150> to<00:01:06.360> do<00:01:06.510> 13<00:01:07.640> gigabytes<00:01:08.640> ok

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:10.280 
have to pick is to do 13 gigabytes ok

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.940 
have to pick is to do 13 gigabytes ok
and<00:01:11.280> create<00:01:11.610> it

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:12.950 
and create it

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.890 
and create it
make<00:01:13.950> sure<00:01:14.100> to<00:01:14.310> gigabytes<00:01:14.610> so<00:01:15.509> you<00:01:15.600> could<00:01:15.689> fit

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
make sure to gigabytes so you could fit

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.130 
make sure to gigabytes so you could fit
the<00:01:16.049> file<00:01:16.290> and<00:01:16.640> then<00:01:17.640> that<00:01:18.390> will<00:01:18.509> pop<00:01:18.689> up<00:01:18.720> this

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
the file and then that will pop up this

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.749 
the file and then that will pop up this
is<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.320> original<00:01:19.470> right<00:01:19.860> here<00:01:20.100> this<00:01:20.310> is<00:01:20.400> the

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
is the original right here this is the

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:25.810 
is the original right here this is the
new<00:01:21.170> empty<00:01:22.170> one<00:01:22.380> so<00:01:22.770> you<00:01:23.640> open<00:01:23.820> it<00:01:24.259> it<00:01:25.259> will<00:01:25.290> be

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:25.820 
new empty one so you open it it will be

applications show package contents and
go<00:02:06.460> to<00:02:06.520> resources<00:02:07.080> and<00:02:08.080> you<00:02:08.619> would<00:02:08.740> need<00:02:08.890> to

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:09.009 
go to resources and you would need to

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:12.990 
go to resources and you would need to
delete<00:02:09.460> this<00:02:09.869> dmg<00:02:10.869> this<00:02:11.560> the<00:02:12.430> original<00:02:12.820> one

and when you replace the file you when
you<00:02:23.220> open<00:02:24.220> it<00:02:24.280> up<00:02:24.400> again<00:02:24.700> you'll<00:02:25.090> be<00:02:25.270> able<00:02:25.450> to

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
you open it up again you'll be able to

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:32.580 
you open it up again you'll be able to
drag<00:02:26.290> and<00:02:26.530> drop<00:02:26.740> things<00:02:27.010> into<00:02:27.780> it<00:02:31.200> and<00:02:32.200> you<00:02:32.440> do

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
drag and drop things into it and you do

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:38.340 
drag and drop things into it and you do
that<00:02:33.510> make<00:02:34.510> sure<00:02:34.540> you<00:02:34.870> go<00:02:34.990> to<00:02:35.020> data<00:02:35.290> SDS<00:02:37.350> where

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:38.350 
that make sure you go to data SDS where

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:41.840 
that make sure you go to data SDS where
is<00:02:38.470> it<00:02:38.709> and<00:02:39.520> then<00:02:39.760> you<00:02:39.880> have<00:02:40.030> to<00:02:40.150> go<00:02:40.270> to<00:02:40.380> tables

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
is it and then you have to go to tables

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:45.060 
is it and then you have to go to tables
either<00:02:42.850> drag<00:02:43.150> and<00:02:43.180> drop<00:02:43.630> that<00:02:44.350> file<00:02:44.650> in<00:02:44.890> there

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:45.070 
either drag and drop that file in there

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:49.470 
either drag and drop that file in there
and<00:02:45.430> you'll<00:02:45.550> have<00:02:45.730> it<00:02:47.100> and<00:02:48.100> so<00:02:48.459> when<00:02:49.330> that

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
and you'll have it and so when that

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.300 
and you'll have it and so when that
happens<00:02:49.930> you<00:02:50.110> open<00:02:50.770> it<00:02:50.890> up<00:02:51.010> and<00:02:51.130> you'll<00:02:51.250> have

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
happens you open it up and you'll have

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:56.460 
happens you open it up and you'll have
mod<00:02:53.100> right<00:02:54.100> now<00:02:54.250> it's<00:02:54.430> running<00:02:55.290> might<00:02:56.290> be<00:02:56.440> a

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
mod right now it's running might be a

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:11.790 
mod right now it's running might be a
little<00:02:56.680> bit<00:02:56.770> uglier<00:03:02.910> and<00:03:03.910> change<00:03:04.209> it<00:03:10.800> let's

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:11.800 
little bit uglier and change it let's

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:18.509 
little bit uglier and change it let's
see<00:03:12.100> if<00:03:12.220> it<00:03:12.310> make<00:03:12.430> this<00:03:12.580> faster<00:03:17.310> it<00:03:18.310> looks

00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:18.519 
see if it make this faster it looks

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:31.370 
see if it make this faster it looks
pretty

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:06:37.840 

wait<00:03:32.010> now

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:37.850 

00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:40.850 

nothing
