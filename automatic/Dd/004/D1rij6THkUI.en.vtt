00:00:01.099 --> 00:00:05.320
 granite is one of the most resistant stones on the planet and is the 

00:00:05.319 --> 00:00:08.359
 favorite of today's interior decorators 

00:00:08.359 --> 00:00:11.019
 as construction material is eternal 

00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:13.189
 Elegant 

00:00:13.189 --> 00:00:16.189
 well its activity 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.330
 min the granite factory of nature you will find many 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:24.710
 kilometers of the track surface 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:26.460
 pachuca 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.939
 Magma accumulates pressure due to intense heat 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.939
 and makes its way through the cracks of the earth's crust 

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:38.530
 as it rises it is cooling and solidifying forming create landmark 

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:46.510
 most of the granite is buried under sedimentary rocks 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:49.510
 majority on the surface of the earth 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:00.090
 6 the first step is to delimit a section of rock wall of 30 meters 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.210
 long by 7 wide 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:08.020
 Using gas cut long and narrow channels to free the sides 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.189
 then holes of seven meters are made along the part 

00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:14.020
 back and the bottom 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.020
 this gets explosive wire in the holes 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:30.630
 the explosion separates the section 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.210
 then a combination of steel plate and steel hook holes is used 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:39.240
 wedges to cut it over and over again until it gets in blocks of three 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.640
 meters long by one and a half meters wide and high 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.450
 the size that most granite factories can handle 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:54.600
 he argued that the blocks may be small but each weighs more than 20 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.600
 thousand kilos 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:04.510
 Once in the factory the granite is cut into slabs 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:09.400
 with this saw slabs of more than 5 centimeters thick are achieved 

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:13.230
 the metal segments of the blade contain diamond particles 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.310
 synthetics that create the friction needed for cutting 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:20.780
 uu the water prevents the saw from overheating is a slow process 

00:02:21.639 --> 00:02:25.219
 the saw cuts less than two square meters of granite per hour 

00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:31.079
 likins to cut slabs of less than five centimeters a saw is used 

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:35.649
 multiple this saw has steel blades with enough tension to not 

00:02:35.649 --> 00:02:39.739
 bend under the pressure of the ica cut to cut as straight as possible 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:40.599
 possible 

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:44.480
 the vertical saw cuts a rhythm of 8 square meters per hour 

00:02:45.889 --> 00:02:49.389
 it takes three whole days to cut the blockade 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:01.799
 mons once cut the last slab polished 

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:04.939
 this is where all the beauty of the stone will be revealed 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:12.649
 The polishing chain has 19 heads and each of which contains six 

00:03:12.649 --> 00:03:15.649
 Bricks that polish by abrasion 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:20.919
 the polishing chain processes one square meter of granite per minute 

00:03:21.859 --> 00:03:26.049
 to achieve a brilliant finish the slab goes through the 19 heads 

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:29.889
 for a semi pri finish from before it goes only for the first ten 

00:03:36.889 --> 00:03:41.859
 flow for a rustic finish the slabs if they do not go through the polishing chain but 

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:46.419
 that undergo directly a glider process a jet of water prevents 

00:03:46.419 --> 00:03:50.719
 the slab cracks with the heat while a propane flame goes through its 

00:03:50.719 --> 00:03:53.719
 surface 

00:03:55.939 --> 00:04:00.029
 this intense heat causes the quartz inside the granite to explode 

00:04:00.029 --> 00:04:04.559
 creating a rough surface this technique is used to prevent a soil 

00:04:04.559 --> 00:04:07.559
 what are you doing? 

00:04:09.699 --> 00:04:13.629
 after the finishing, it is only necessary to cut the slabs according to the 

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:16.629
 Specifications 

00:04:31.599 --> 00:04:35.310
 yes the interlaced minerals that give the stone its characteristic 

00:04:35.309 --> 00:04:40.129
 mottled and its extraordinary resistance will always be an example of style 

00:04:40.909 --> 00:04:41.669
 and longevity
