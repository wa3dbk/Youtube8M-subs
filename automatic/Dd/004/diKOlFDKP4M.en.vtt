00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:18.350
 protein shakes are not harmful 

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:19.869
 for the human body a person can 

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:23.480
 be consuming protein shakes 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:26.450
 throughout his life without having any 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:28.790
 kind of side effect then 

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:31.730
 because there is a myth that shakes 

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:35.150
 of proteins are bad not so much 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:37.340
 simple basically this happens by the 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:39.829
 ignorance because we are fooled 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:42.590
 by the sellers and so he puts 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:44.540
 behind the protein jars in 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:47.930
 the jars of proteins in the cans of 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:50.540
 23 kilos automatically in the part 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:53.060
 Back in virtually all 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:56.240
 marks the goods that we have to 

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:58.750
 consume about 50 grams of protein per 

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:58.750
 taking 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:05.210
 it is known that the body is not capable of 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:07.280
 adequately synthesize more than 30 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:10.070
 grams of protein per take so 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:12.680
 take those 20 grams of extra protein 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:15.560
 that is 50 grams of protein hit 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:18.470
 the only thing that will cause is a 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:21.500
 deterioration of our liver from our 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:24.409
 kidneys of our digestive system in 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:27.020
 general the body does not come prepared 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:29.060
 to absorb that large amount of 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.100
 proteins but if we know how to administer 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:34.790
 well the shots of the shakes of 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:37.850
 proteins there will be no problem 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:39.170
 the right amount to take in the case 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:43.610
 of a protein it would be 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:47.150
 approximately between 24 and 30 from 24 to 30 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:49.970
 grams per take no more than two shots at 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:51.430
 day and they are well spaced by 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:54.100
 example 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:55.960
 one after training and one in the 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.910
 breakfast that would be an example of two 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:02.380
 you take but I already say that with one after 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:05.229
 of training is enough from 24 to 30 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:07.150
 grams of protein is recommended not 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:10.330
 It will cause you no problem if you 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:13.240
 you do like this and you are also very 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:15.310
 attentive of the components that the 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:18.490
 protein jar that you have bought 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:22.150
 do not take them with all kinds of vitamins 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:24.580
 non-essential amino acids or against 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:27.820
 less things carry against purer be the 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:30.820
 protein and less sugars and less things 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:34.800
 they throw them better is an advice that I give you 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:34.800
 as a nutritionist and I hope it is
