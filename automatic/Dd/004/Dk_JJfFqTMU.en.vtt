00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.760
 hi everyone knows and dar k 

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:14.410
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:16.180
 new video to tell you about black 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:19.630
 ops 3 that could maybe or 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:21.189
 maybe not go out on old gen and in 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:23.230
 the video you can glimpse a 

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:24.550
 gameplay of black ops 2 where I was in 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:26.350
 going out of the map because actually 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:28.390
 and ben I now own that 

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:29.680
 glitch gameplay that I had found or 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:31.510
 blow I counted m a few years ago 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:33.370
 on my channel and I 'm sorry but I 

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:34.809
 no longer has real gameplay in 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:36.879
 multiplayer there it will be only gameplay 

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:38.019
 of glitch and so as I wanted to said 

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:39.640
 in this video I told you about 

00:00:38.019 --> 00:00:42.580
 black ops three quarters in fact and ben 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:44.440
 after the unveiling of the game by acti 

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:46.570
 vision and many luggage 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:49.150
 people who went to ask them if 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:51.909
 to this new treyarch title will be 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:54.220
 available on xbox 360 as well as on 

00:00:51.909 --> 00:00:56.320
 playstation 3 and active vision at the yard 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:58.360
 have not answered these questions there they 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.769
 have remained so silent and so is going 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:01.299
 the many fans who did not have any 

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:03.280
 answers went to see afterwards 

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:04.930
 shinobi if they are two so that's 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.740
 the insider that I had spoken to you about 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:07.240
 my old video 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.950
 it's a person who knows a lot of 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.210
 things on black ops 3 and this person 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:11.680
 not go running nearly all 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:13.090
 are the new games coming out 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.550
 at the same time it's pretty much his 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:17.740
 work and said that 27 people 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:21.280
 black ops 3 will be available on 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:23.440
 xbox 360 as well as on playstation 3 and 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.630
 he even says that the game will be so 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:28.390
 developed by another studio 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:30.790
 a bit like advance warfare or cng 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:33.820
 mores games developed the game on 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:35.800
 next gen and there have been moon studios 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:38.050
 who developed it on old gen and 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:39.430
 apparently shinobi claimed that this 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:41.200
 will be a little like that catherine evening lighthouse 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:43.630
 that is, treyarch want to do 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.040
 the game on next gen and another studio 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:46.810
 are going to do it on old gen 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.670
 So not necessarily the game will be 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:50.320
 disgusting on old gen because the 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:52.420
 studio that realizes it is not so 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:54.550
 competent than real studios like 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.110
 treyarch is another proof that is going 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:59.110
 even more sowing doubt is that we 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:00.850
 did and ben sony had claude the teaser 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:03.729
 of black ops 3 on their youtube channel 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:05.680
 is in the title of this teaser they have 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:07.990
 put so bah black ops 3 back in black 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:09.580
 is right next they put ps4 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:11.650
 while otherwise we just look at his 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:14.110
 right and banias a video of the island aux 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:16.750
 dimensions that owns him in the title 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:18.080
 ps3 and ps4 and so if the game will be 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.730
 only developed on ps3 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.160
 well that's for old players 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.840
 gen down understand that their console is 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.040
 dead and so they have to buy the 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.730
 next-gen so it's a little action 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.950
 marketing 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:29.840
 I even think that limit sony microsoft 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.460
 in active down they have not to 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.500
 that they release the game on old gen and 

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:34.820
 for them to sell more their 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.260
 next gen consoles 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:38.690
 so that happened at that moment 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:41.060
 banks it's really not so game 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:42.620
 will be developed on old gen or not in 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.880
 anyway what is certain is what is 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.850
 also logical is that it will be developed 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:48.380
 on next-gen and as well as on pc and 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:49.640
 maybe even on wiiu 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:52.640
 because as you will be able 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:54.560
 to see it on a screen that comes from 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.720
 call of duty point com website 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:59.750
 as you know we can associate our 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:01.220
 live xbox accounts of steam or 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:03.230
 playstation network and now we 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:05.570
 can also be associated with the Nintendo account 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:07.640
 which can also mean that the game 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:08.600
 normally will also be developed on 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:10.580
 Wii U 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:12.170
 a bit like black ops 2 so here we are 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:14.209
 not sure if the game will release this role 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:15.830
 jane and on wii but in any case eh ben 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:19.130
 you just have to wait for a 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:20.420
 activision response or treyarch and 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:21.560
 so that's the case anyway 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:23.450
 expect that I have for this video 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.830
 information about cold black ops like 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:26.390
 usually do not forget to tell me 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:28.130
 they want you more on my channel 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:30.560
 youtube see it does not bother at all 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:33.440
 to inform you about what's new 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:35.120
 I learn about this famous new album of 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:36.320
 treyarch and so that's it if you would have 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.670
 liked this video is well forgotten 

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:39.830

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:41.420
