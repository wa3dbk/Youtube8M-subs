00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.040
 Tala body movement is almost normal life and due to lack of exercise 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.040
 A lot of basic physical strength 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:21.240
 Manjiman amount jeongjak eating packed meals are well-packed Some have irregular eating habits 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:23.270
 Do you see if your mother is alright? 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.270
 Ah 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:31.189
 4. As soon as this came out at all the screen yet again so far back tears dripping again 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:36.020
 Do you know to red 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:38.989
 It's a bit cloudy when you suck it, so maybe you hit # 5 4. 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:44.920
 But seeing this now entrusts my parents with a bankbook 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:49.719
 Do not give me no mind nwaya lead future mothers t know enough ah jaengyeo 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:54.550
 I am not picked dwaetgo sleep on a few favorite spicy food 

00:00:49.719 --> 00:01:00.940
 But again rattling the Zamora mean anything Oh I want this parable about a lot 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:01:01.420
 Neulsang so real that even if the food is perfect wooden tablets ratio this also buy nonfood 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:07.570
 Please eat 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:10.100
 Oh yeah o Once the food you brush your mother is half the apple 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:14.420
 Oh, it's all a little bit like this. Ah. 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:16.100
 Oh, and the protein intake is very short, 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:20.299
 Anemia is very severe. 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:24.110
 However, most of the foods rich in iron are animal proteins 

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:27.590
 You keep this kind of meal pattern because the protein is in many foods. 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:31.369
 Then you 'll definitely improve your soap and make it harder. 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:36.740
 Mom, I always go outside to eat when I come to my house. 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:40.780
 It's always meat. Pork. Google likes pork. I've got bacon. 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.780
 Just because of the reason of the pork belly. 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:51.070
 Anyway, the first thing is the food. 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:51.640
 Well, then, why do not you think about problems related to lack of motivation? 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:55.690
 There is not 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:59.680
 4 Once my mother is almost at home and I do not go outside well . 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:02.260
 This would be the lack of menopausal women doing exercises that eopjyo bodeon fat 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:05.830
 I can see the metabolic disorder that does not break down. 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:10.020
 However, the risk can also be very high. 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:14.500
 It's the lack of exercise itself, and if you do not go outside, the synthesis of vitamin d does not work well . 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:20.170
 The risk of osteoporosis can also rise and there is a direct link between menopause and depression 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:22.209
 Now that I see that she's going to have that kind of athletic ability 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:26.770
 You did a simple evaluation of your possessions. 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:32.680
 For the results gonna give you my word on the book in the first reverse movement 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:34.100
 Pearl's book The God Armor stand looking only for the best upper body muscle Republic of Korea shut down 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:38.480
 What is it? 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:44.930
 Now, this is another one kind of inde Aaa most was the sense of balance test 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:47.180
 That is because ura mother - in - law had about 14 seconds, and the fact that a great sense of balance 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:50.870
 I'm on the low side. 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:55.250
 The reason why this sense of balance has fallen is because of the anemia 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:58.870
 But usually when we are alone, the exercise is only one kind of fun 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:04.390
 And a lot of you left, your mother should get some expert advice 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:09.800
 The'm thinking that there is equally no need to get a workout heard ah ah ah Well 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:13.760
 I thought subside and even friends that look to improve Were not 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:18.320
 So one more thing I've seen is cardiopulmonary endurance now . 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:20.390
 Ma is the 23 minutes as can be seen, the others in earlier screens 

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:24.590
 You did not exercise. 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:25.280
 Oh, and after a while, it's hard and you almost give up. 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:28.910
 It's the same. 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:34.200
 Cardiopulmonary endurance is very far away , so I will continue to exercise a little 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:36.200
 I think I need to take care of my mother all the more I need. 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.200
 U
