still a bit premium and still is built
very<00:00:54.059> well<00:00:54.149> and<00:00:54.710> Volkswagen<00:00:55.710> explains<00:00:56.070> it<00:00:56.280> as

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
very well and Volkswagen explains it as

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.459 
very well and Volkswagen explains it as
something<00:00:57.360> like<00:00:57.449> an<00:00:57.600> iPod

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
something like an iPod

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.139 
something like an iPod
although<00:00:58.949> it's<00:00:59.070> small<00:00:59.250> it's<00:00:59.850> still<00:01:00.030> very

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
although it's small it's still very

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.450 
although it's small it's still very
functional<00:01:00.690> it<00:01:00.840> still<00:01:01.320> it<00:01:01.829> feels<00:01:02.070> fits<00:01:02.280> your

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
functional it still it feels fits your

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.609

pocket<00:01:02.820> and<00:01:02.940> it's<00:01:03.090> still<00:01:03.300> kind<00:01:04.290> of<00:01:04.409> not<00:01:04.559> very

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
pocket and it's still kind of not very

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.469 
pocket and it's still kind of not very
expensive<00:01:05.280> so<00:01:05.670> I<00:01:05.880> don't<00:01:06.119> think<00:01:06.240> we<00:01:06.299> should

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
expensive so I don't think we should

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.750 
expensive so I don't think we should
read<00:01:06.930> too<00:01:07.110> much<00:01:07.260> into<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.680> into<00:01:08.490> how<00:01:08.610> they

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
read too much into the into how they

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.929 
read too much into the into how they
market<00:01:09.119> it<00:01:09.270> but<00:01:09.750> what<00:01:10.710> works<00:01:10.950> wagon<00:01:11.369> will<00:01:11.729> do

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
market it but what works wagon will do

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.270 
market it but what works wagon will do
is<00:01:12.180> that<00:01:12.600> it's<00:01:12.750> a<00:01:12.840> family<00:01:13.320> so<00:01:13.710> the<00:01:13.860> app<00:01:13.979> will

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
is that it's a family so the app will

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.630 
is that it's a family so the app will
spawn<00:01:14.760> a<00:01:14.790> sedan<00:01:15.180> and<00:01:15.530> it<00:01:16.530> will<00:01:16.680> also<00:01:17.040> spawn<00:01:17.430> an

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
spawn a sedan and it will also spawn an

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.660 
spawn a sedan and it will also spawn an
SUV<00:01:18.180> now<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:18.930> sedan<00:01:19.439> version<00:01:19.770> we<00:01:20.460> have<00:01:20.549> not

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
SUV now the sedan version we have not
