carving<00:00:55.739> is<00:00:55.980> a<00:00:56.489> decent<00:00:57.480> on<00:00:57.840> this<00:00:58.460> this<00:00:59.460> for<00:00:59.969> me

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
carving is a decent on this this for me

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.670 
carving is a decent on this this for me
it<00:01:00.420> doesn't<00:01:00.780> flex<00:01:01.469> because<00:01:02.250> I'm<00:01:02.460> 80<00:01:03.210> pounds<00:01:03.840> so

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
it doesn't flex because I'm 80 pounds so

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:10.340 
it doesn't flex because I'm 80 pounds so
it's<00:01:05.600> not<00:01:06.600> really<00:01:07.070> like<00:01:08.330> any<00:01:09.330> loading<00:01:09.720> boards

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
it's not really like any loading boards

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.920 
it's not really like any loading boards
um<00:01:10.850> this<00:01:11.850> board<00:01:12.210> is<00:01:12.270> pretty<00:01:12.659> good<00:01:12.869> for

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
um this board is pretty good for

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.010 
um this board is pretty good for
downhill<00:01:13.909> considering<00:01:14.909> I<00:01:15.060> don't<00:01:15.119> have<00:01:15.570> any

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
downhill considering I don't have any

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:22.940 
downhill considering I don't have any
flex<00:01:17.689> like<00:01:18.689> it's<00:01:19.350> pretty<00:01:20.009> stable<00:01:21.799> sliding<00:01:22.799> on

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
flex like it's pretty stable sliding on

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.410 
flex like it's pretty stable sliding on
