00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:33.260
 Direct link only going to give here and 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:35.660
 they will automatically be downloaded 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:37.879
 this little file that surely 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:44.410
 you already have to know the file 

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:46.850
 weighs 1.70 megabytes mb with 70 finish 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:48.280
 kilobytes forgiveness 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:50.650
 6 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.450
 let's go to the link 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:54.040
 for that I 'm going to be leaving the 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:56.020
 link here in the description you 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:58.210
 they're just going to click on paste and 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:59.830
 ready as you can see this is being 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:02.220
 downloading quite fast and I'm going 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:04.210
 to cancel since I do not want it duplicated 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:06.250
 well once if it has already 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:08.830
 downloaded you the only thing that are going to 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:11.260
 to do is give him the right over him and 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:14.600
 let's run it as administrator 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:17.240
 let's click on and 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:20.270
 once you tell us that you have to have 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:22.670
 permissions to make changes in the 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:26.270
 minecraft is not going to appear in your and we're going 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:29.600
 to wait for me to analyze the minecraft of 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:32.090
 minecraft file point sheet and once 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:35.080
 that I have already analyzed it, we are going to 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.080
 appear these 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:42.070
 the truth I do not understand it much here 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:44.260
 but I'm going to mark you 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:46.979
 nothing else I'm going to leave the pure ones that say 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.979
 textures 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.730
 ok I must leave these three the truth 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.280
 I do not know what these babies are for 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:59.160
 although they should know how much tutorial 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.740
 but as I tell you its with those three that 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:04.250
 have marked textures has them 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:07.900
 perfectly work the textures 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:10.630
 well let's click on patch 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:13.900
 and there would be ready good how can they 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:18.260
 see is already patched we are going to close 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:22.310
 over here and let's go 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:26.680
 let's go to our minecraft once 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.680
 that has opened let's give the launch 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:31.810
 once you have already opened our 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:33.930
 minecraft this how can you see I have 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:37.680
 the texture 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:39.629
 what would be the 1.5 have made a small 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.480
 modification at least here I think 

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:44.879
 that have made a small modification 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:47.879
 As you can see, the button no longer appears 

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:50.790
 of textures for that let's go to go 

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:53.910
 to go to button options and let's go to 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:55.950
 where it says texture pack 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:59.910
 here you download the texture of 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:03.510
 your preference, I will leave you 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:06.540
 a page where you can download 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:08.490
 textures for and to add textures 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:11.190
 we're just going to give where it says 

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:12.810
 open texture folder and 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:14.790
 will automatically open them 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:16.250
 folder is the texture that I have 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:19.370
 installed 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:21.230
 and how can you see from 1.5 if 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:25.120
 they want this texture I can 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:28.880
 upload to mediafire if you like 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:31.890
 this water we are going to close here and 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:34.500
 we are going to select this 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:37.700
 in my case I will give in ready and I will 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:40.080
 give it ready let's go to options 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:43.220
 multiplayer to see if it is already online 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:43.220
 to be because I in 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:49.160
 not our online yet so is that 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:49.160
 I'm going to start a new world 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:58.629
 I could not play that world that says 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:58.629
 with a weird name 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:07.610
 good good as you can see is that here 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:11.819
 I have the textures forgive if degrees 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:16.590
 with a little bit of the lake but 

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:18.030
 is half past good is how can 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:21.810
 see the textures work correctly 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:25.940
 I'm going to select a piece of 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:25.940
 wash to see if we find each track 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:33.599
 with silver 

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:36.479
 as you can see it is completely 

00:04:33.599 --> 00:04:40.369
 patched does not leave the error that comes out 

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:40.369
 sometimes he says that the 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:46.290
 we need more patch to be able 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:48.600
 visualize and install good if you 

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:52.170
 they like this texture and if they have a 

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:54.680
 more or less powerful computer this one does not 

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:57.080
 he needs so many 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:59.870
 I could leave this link in the 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:02.639
 description of the video once it has been uploaded 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:05.069
 by me this 

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:06.689
 this package of textures as you can see 

00:05:05.069 --> 00:05:08.819
 work properly does not have 

00:05:06.689 --> 00:05:10.409
 amendment does not have a failure as they can 

00:05:08.819 --> 00:05:13.340

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:16.490

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:18.650
