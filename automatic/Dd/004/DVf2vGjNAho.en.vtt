00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
alright so let's begin why the first

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.279 
alright so let's begin why the first
let's<00:00:19.920> do<00:00:20.039> the<00:00:20.100> drag<00:00:20.460> shot<00:00:21.020> basically<00:00:22.020> you

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
let's do the drag shot basically you

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.279 
let's do the drag shot basically you
pain<00:00:22.590> and<00:00:23.039> move<00:00:23.970> to<00:00:24.480> the<00:00:24.600> left<00:00:24.810> or<00:00:25.140> the<00:00:25.170> right

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
pain and move to the left or the right

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.210 
pain and move to the left or the right
just<00:00:25.920> like<00:00:26.070> that<00:00:26.330> so<00:00:27.330> you<00:00:27.390> ain't<00:00:28.080> move<00:00:28.650> left<00:00:29.010> or

just like that so you ain't move left or
move<00:00:29.369> right<00:00:29.990> alright<00:00:30.990> so<00:00:31.230> here<00:00:31.650> you<00:00:31.769> go<00:00:31.800> that

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790

move right alright so here you go that
was<00:00:32.910> a<00:00:32.940> fail<00:00:33.329> I<00:00:33.719> tried<00:00:34.200> getting<00:00:34.500> gotten<00:00:34.920> so

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
was a fail I tried getting gotten so

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.220 
was a fail I tried getting gotten so
let's<00:00:36.000> try<00:00:36.149> that<00:00:36.300> one<00:00:36.450> more<00:00:36.570> time<00:00:36.750> with<00:00:37.110> this

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
let's try that one more time with this

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.280 
let's try that one more time with this
guy<00:00:37.489> aim<00:00:38.489> and<00:00:38.910> move<00:00:39.180> to<00:00:39.329> the<00:00:39.360> left<00:00:39.600> or<00:00:39.870> right<00:00:39.899> as

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
guy aim and move to the left or right as

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.459 
guy aim and move to the left or right as
quick<00:00:40.649> as<00:00:40.860> possible<00:00:41.660> so<00:00:42.660> and<00:00:42.840> you<00:00:42.960> kill<00:00:43.260> them<00:00:43.350> a

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
quick as possible so and you kill them a

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.639 
quick as possible so and you kill them a
lot<00:00:43.620> faster<00:00:43.860> and<00:00:44.399> so<00:00:45.329> they<00:00:45.450> won't<00:00:45.660> have<00:00:45.989> a<00:00:46.200> time

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
lot faster and so they won't have a time

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.819 
lot faster and so they won't have a time
to<00:00:46.860> shoot<00:00:47.010> you<00:00:47.450> so<00:00:48.450> you<00:00:48.510> aim<00:00:48.809> and<00:00:49.140> move<00:00:49.590> to<00:00:49.770> the

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
to shoot you so you aim and move to the

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.650 
to shoot you so you aim and move to the
left<00:00:50.039> in<00:00:50.399> this<00:00:50.640> case<00:00:50.940> yeah<00:00:51.239> because<00:00:51.390> he's<00:00:51.570> in

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
left in this case yeah because he's in

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.140 
left in this case yeah because he's in
the<00:00:51.750> left

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:53.150 
the left

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:55.570 
the left
alright<00:00:54.150> so<00:00:54.270> now<00:00:54.390> let's<00:00:54.570> do<00:00:54.690> a<00:00:54.720> blind<00:00:54.960> fire

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:55.580
