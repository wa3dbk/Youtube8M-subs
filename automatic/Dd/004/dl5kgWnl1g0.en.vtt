00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:33.590 
going to cut a short here so it starts
to<00:03:30.390> create<00:03:31.640> and<00:03:32.640> once<00:03:32.820> it<00:03:32.940> does<00:03:33.090> that<00:03:33.120> it<00:03:33.330> then

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:33.600 
to create and once it does that it then

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:35.270 
to create and once it does that it then
starts<00:03:33.990> thinking<00:03:34.320> about<00:03:34.410> adding<00:03:34.890> the<00:03:35.010> the

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
starts thinking about adding the the

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.610 
starts thinking about adding the the
menu<00:03:35.610> that's<00:03:36.540> what<00:03:36.750> it's<00:03:36.900> doing<00:03:37.020> here<00:03:37.140> this

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
menu that's what it's doing here this

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:41.960 
menu that's what it's doing here this
takes<00:03:37.800> a<00:03:37.860> bit<00:03:38.010> of<00:03:38.070> time<00:03:38.160> as<00:03:38.400> well<00:03:40.790> I've<00:03:41.790> just

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
takes a bit of time as well I've just

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.110 
takes a bit of time as well I've just
cut<00:03:42.150> it<00:03:42.270> short<00:03:42.300> to<00:03:42.780> remove<00:03:43.170> the<00:03:43.260> video<00:03:43.350> on<00:03:43.620> and

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:44.120 
cut it short to remove the video on and

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.190 
cut it short to remove the video on and
and<00:03:45.120> then<00:03:45.240> done<00:03:45.420> and<00:03:45.570> then<00:03:45.660> it's<00:03:45.780> just<00:03:45.840> burn<00:03:46.080> to

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
and then done and then it's just burn to

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:47.660 
and then done and then it's just burn to
disc<00:03:46.350> so<00:03:46.830> make<00:03:46.980> sure<00:03:47.010> you've<00:03:47.280> got<00:03:47.310> a<00:03:47.400> clear

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670 
disc so make sure you've got a clear

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:49.850 
disc so make sure you've got a clear
disc<00:03:47.910> and<00:03:48.720> you<00:03:48.810> drive<00:03:49.080> and<00:03:49.380> then<00:03:49.470> just<00:03:49.650> burn<00:03:49.830> it

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:49.860 
disc and you drive and then just burn it

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:54.420 
disc and you drive and then just burn it
and<00:03:50.340> away<00:03:50.520> we<00:03:50.640> go

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:54.430 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:57.339 

so<00:03:55.430> you'll<00:03:56.270> see<00:03:56.569> as<00:03:56.780> it<00:03:56.930> goes<00:03:57.080> through<00:03:57.110> the

00:03:57.339 --> 00:03:57.349 
so you'll see as it goes through the

00:03:57.349 --> 00:03:59.050 
so you'll see as it goes through the
burning<00:03:57.739> process<00:03:57.860> and<00:03:58.459> here<00:03:58.610> we<00:03:58.730> are<00:03:58.879> just

00:03:59.050 --> 00:03:59.060 
burning process and here we are just

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:05.790 
burning process and here we are just
about<00:03:59.209> there<00:03:59.750> against<00:04:00.530> takes<00:04:00.830> a<00:04:00.920> bit<00:04:01.040> of<00:04:01.069> time

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:05.800 

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:09.670 

right<00:04:06.800> and<00:04:07.160> then<00:04:08.030> you're<00:04:08.239> done<00:04:08.360> so<00:04:09.349> what<00:04:09.590> does

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:09.680 
right and then you're done so what does

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:10.900 
right and then you're done so what does
it<00:04:09.739> look<00:04:09.800> like<00:04:09.860> on<00:04:10.069> the<00:04:10.190> computer<00:04:10.250> what<00:04:10.730> here

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:10.910 
it look like on the computer what here

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:11.140 
it look like on the computer what here
we<00:04:10.940> are

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:11.150 
we are

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:13.420 
we are
I'm<00:04:11.959> just<00:04:12.230> recorded<00:04:12.920> one<00:04:13.040> o'clock<00:04:13.220> of<00:04:13.370> the
