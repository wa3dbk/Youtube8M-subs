00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.679 
awesome like absolute limit peak of
human<00:01:57.479> ability<00:01:57.960> but<00:01:58.649> logically<00:01:59.130> I<00:01:59.280> think<00:01:59.850> what

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
human ability but logically I think what

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.530 
human ability but logically I think what
they're<00:02:00.810> doing<00:02:00.869> is<00:02:01.259> cloning<00:02:01.649> people

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:02.540 
they're doing is cloning people

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:05.359 
they're doing is cloning people
surrogate<00:02:03.540> they're<00:02:03.719> gonna<00:02:03.840> replace<00:02:04.369> people

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
surrogate they're gonna replace people

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.789 
surrogate they're gonna replace people
say<00:02:05.579> if<00:02:05.640> you<00:02:05.820> die<00:02:06.060> you<00:02:06.390> can<00:02:06.899> be<00:02:07.020> replaced<00:02:07.439> you

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
say if you die you can be replaced you

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.040 
say if you die you can be replaced you
know<00:02:07.920> you're<00:02:08.369> basically<00:02:09.030> like<00:02:09.270> creating<00:02:09.810> a

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
know you're basically like creating a

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.589 
know you're basically like creating a
checkpoint<00:02:10.530> for<00:02:10.800> your<00:02:10.920> life<00:02:11.160> it's<00:02:11.550> what<00:02:12.420> I'm

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
checkpoint for your life it's what I'm

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.720 
checkpoint for your life it's what I'm
thinking

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
thinking

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:15.940 
thinking
and<00:02:13.819> this<00:02:14.540> kind<00:02:14.989> of<00:02:15.140> gets<00:02:15.349> a<00:02:15.530> little<00:02:15.769> bit

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
and this kind of gets a little bit

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:17.440 
and this kind of gets a little bit
reinforced<00:02:16.550> when<00:02:16.670> you<00:02:16.790> see<00:02:16.940> the<00:02:17.030> next<00:02:17.209> frame

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
reinforced when you see the next frame

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.570 
reinforced when you see the next frame
of<00:02:17.720> the<00:02:17.870> next<00:02:18.140> area<00:02:18.500> as<00:02:18.590> a<00:02:18.620> title<00:02:18.950> about<00:02:19.459> the

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
of the next area as a title about the

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.280 
of the next area as a title about the
door<00:02:19.730> like<00:02:19.879> the<00:02:19.970> last<00:02:20.120> one<00:02:20.209> what's<00:02:20.780> surrogate

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
door like the last one what's surrogate

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.490 
door like the last one what's surrogate
regen<00:02:21.890> obviously<00:02:22.489> regeneration<00:02:23.390> so<00:02:24.110> this

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
regen obviously regeneration so this

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.320 
regen obviously regeneration so this
could<00:02:24.680> mean<00:02:24.799> they<00:02:25.040> waking<00:02:25.640> up<00:02:25.790> these<00:02:25.940> clones

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
could mean they waking up these clones

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.690 
could mean they waking up these clones
all<00:02:26.569> these<00:02:26.720> bodies<00:02:27.110> but<00:02:27.920> that<00:02:28.159> does<00:02:28.459> kind<00:02:28.670> of

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
all these bodies but that does kind of

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.430 
all these bodies but that does kind of
beg<00:02:28.879> the<00:02:29.000> question<00:02:29.120> at<00:02:29.540> what<00:02:29.780> point<00:02:30.170> are<00:02:30.290> these

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
beg the question at what point are these

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.699 
beg the question at what point are these
bodies<00:02:30.799> from<00:02:31.099> and<00:02:31.900> honestly<00:02:32.900> guys<00:02:33.140> we<00:02:33.560> are

really shooting in the dark on this

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:37.360 
really shooting in the dark on this
topic<00:02:35.569> but<00:02:35.989> I<00:02:36.200> just<00:02:36.739> fought<00:02:36.920> it<00:02:36.950> will<00:02:37.160> be<00:02:37.280> an

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
topic but I just fought it will be an

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.070 
topic but I just fought it will be an
incredibly<00:02:38.030> interesting<00:02:38.599> thing<00:02:38.810> for<00:02:39.019> you

incredibly interesting thing for you

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:41.380 
incredibly interesting thing for you
guys<00:02:39.230> to<00:02:39.410> think<00:02:39.440> about<00:02:39.890> and<00:02:40.190> how<00:02:41.030> it<00:02:41.209> could

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 
guys to think about and how it could

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:42.970 
guys to think about and how it could
relate<00:02:41.750> to<00:02:42.079> the<00:02:42.230> rest<00:02:42.440> of<00:02:42.680> the<00:02:42.769> game

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
relate to the rest of the game

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.250 
relate to the rest of the game
canonically<00:02:43.579> now<00:02:43.909> in<00:02:44.090> terms<00:02:44.659> of<00:02:44.930> the<00:02:45.140> actual

canon of the story there's not really

canon of the story there's not really
much<00:02:48.950> going<00:02:49.010> on<00:02:49.430> in<00:02:49.730> terms<00:02:50.030> of<00:02:50.269> kind<00:02:51.079> of

supernatural kind of things it looks to

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.349 
supernatural kind of things it looks to
be<00:02:53.989> the<00:02:54.109> like<00:02:54.230> the<00:02:54.349> general<00:02:54.970> cliche<00:02:55.970> kind<00:02:56.269> of

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:56.359 
be the like the general cliche kind of

00:02:56.359 --> 00:02:58.720 
be the like the general cliche kind of
war<00:02:56.569> nuclear<00:02:57.410> we<00:02:57.859> are<00:02:58.010> like<00:02:58.190> you<00:02:58.430> so<00:02:58.609> we're

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
war nuclear we are like you so we're

00:02:58.730 --> 00:02:59.949 
war nuclear we are like you so we're
going<00:02:58.819> to<00:02:58.910> invade<00:02:59.120> that<00:02:59.420> kind<00:02:59.660> of<00:02:59.750> job

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959 
going to invade that kind of job

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:01.960 
going to invade that kind of job
obviously<00:03:00.379> most<00:03:01.129> of<00:03:01.280> the<00:03:01.370> multiplayer<00:03:01.730> maps

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 
obviously most of the multiplayer maps

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:04.780 
obviously most of the multiplayer maps
are<00:03:02.209> always<00:03:02.510> based<00:03:02.720> on<00:03:03.079> the<00:03:03.590> campaign<00:03:04.190> so

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
are always based on the campaign so

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.390 
are always based on the campaign so
there<00:03:05.090> could<00:03:05.329> be<00:03:05.359> a<00:03:05.920> element<00:03:06.920> within<00:03:07.129> the

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 
there could be a element within the

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.400 
there could be a element within the
campaign<00:03:07.760> that<00:03:07.940> gets<00:03:08.120> more<00:03:08.359> sinister<00:03:08.989> and

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:09.410 
campaign that gets more sinister and

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:11.550 
campaign that gets more sinister and
kind<00:03:09.650> of<00:03:09.709> more<00:03:09.829> creepy<00:03:10.400> in<00:03:10.549> terms<00:03:10.819> of<00:03:11.090> how

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
kind of more creepy in terms of how

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.559 
kind of more creepy in terms of how
humans<00:03:12.560> have<00:03:12.799> developed<00:03:13.569> technologically

00:03:14.559 --> 00:03:14.569 
humans have developed technologically

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:16.750 
humans have developed technologically
and<00:03:14.599> physically<00:03:15.379> and<00:03:15.590> how<00:03:16.549> they're

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.760 
and physically and how they're

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.020 
and physically and how they're
incorporating<00:03:17.599> those<00:03:17.780> two<00:03:18.139> factors<00:03:18.919> and<00:03:19.400> that

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030 
incorporating those two factors and that

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:23.199 
incorporating those two factors and that
could<00:03:20.299> be<00:03:20.540> you<00:03:21.230> know<00:03:21.380> a<00:03:21.530> major<00:03:22.069> or<00:03:22.430> a<00:03:22.459> minor<00:03:22.609> key

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:23.209 
could be you know a major or a minor key

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:26.440 
could be you know a major or a minor key
points<00:03:23.569> but<00:03:23.690> I'm<00:03:23.870> thinking<00:03:24.459> because<00:03:25.459> some

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:26.450 
points but I'm thinking because some

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:28.839 
points but I'm thinking because some
maps<00:03:27.079> in<00:03:27.470> Call<00:03:27.859> of<00:03:27.889> Duty<00:03:28.190> history<00:03:28.549> know<00:03:28.730> the

00:03:28.839 --> 00:03:28.849 
maps in Call of Duty history know the

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:31.000 
maps in Call of Duty history know the
DLC<00:03:29.239> maps<00:03:29.510> orders<00:03:29.930> the<00:03:30.079> general<00:03:30.380> modular<00:03:30.799> maps

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.010 
DLC maps orders the general modular maps

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:34.180 
DLC maps orders the general modular maps
have<00:03:31.340> been<00:03:31.669> based<00:03:31.940> on<00:03:32.180> the<00:03:32.329> co-op<00:03:32.690> modes<00:03:33.190> so

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:34.190 
have been based on the co-op modes so

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:36.839 
have been based on the co-op modes so
this<00:03:34.459> could<00:03:34.669> be<00:03:34.940> a<00:03:35.120> setup<00:03:35.389> a<00:03:35.810> very<00:03:36.109> kind<00:03:36.440> of

00:03:36.839 --> 00:03:36.849 
this could be a setup a very kind of

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:40.479 
this could be a setup a very kind of
hint<00:03:37.849> of<00:03:37.940> that<00:03:38.090> set<00:03:38.359> up<00:03:38.599> for<00:03:38.930> a<00:03:39.139> new<00:03:39.500> co-op<00:03:40.069> mode

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:40.489 
hint of that set up for a new co-op mode

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:42.940 
hint of that set up for a new co-op mode
now<00:03:41.090> one<00:03:41.750> Warfare's<00:03:42.230> co-op<00:03:42.590> modes<00:03:42.799> were

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:42.950 
now one Warfare's co-op modes were

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:45.129 
now one Warfare's co-op modes were
really<00:03:43.459> poor<00:03:43.880> like<00:03:44.209> the<00:03:44.480> whole<00:03:44.660> kind<00:03:44.989> of

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:45.139 
really poor like the whole kind of

00:03:45.139 --> 00:03:47.920 
really poor like the whole kind of

of<00:03:50.239> lost<00:03:50.450> its<00:03:50.660> fuzz<00:03:50.900> and<00:03:51.049> extinction<00:03:52.010> I

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.280

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:53.500 
of lost its fuzz and extinction I
think's<00:03:52.579> really<00:03:52.819> good<00:03:53.090> that<00:03:53.209> was<00:03:53.299> a<00:03:53.329> really

fresh idea and that as far as i know
that's<00:03:56.359> finished<00:03:56.840> for<00:03:57.019> now<00:03:57.049> unless<00:03:57.260> they<00:03:57.560> make

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:57.680 
that's finished for now unless they make

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:59.860 
that's finished for now unless they make
a<00:03:57.739> ghost<00:03:58.010> too<00:03:58.310> or<00:03:58.489> carry<00:03:59.060> on<00:03:59.209> the<00:03:59.329> extinction

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:15.290 
official titles called but it was along

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:17.949 
official titles called but it was along
the<00:04:15.440> lines<00:04:15.470> of<00:04:15.739> that<00:04:15.949> so<00:04:16.579> this<00:04:17.150> could<00:04:17.449> be<00:04:17.750> you

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:17.959 
the lines of that so this could be you

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:22.070 
put them in robotic bodies and they went

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:24.730 
put them in robotic bodies and they went
a<00:04:22.159> bit<00:04:22.280> wrong<00:04:22.640> the<00:04:22.880> whole<00:04:23.440> gone<00:04:24.440> wrong

I'm<00:04:28.410> kind<00:04:28.740> of<00:04:28.800> thinking<00:04:28.979> a<00:04:29.490> killing<00:04:29.910> floor

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:30.120

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:33.180 
esque set up for example you know you've

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:34.790 
esque set up for example you know you've
got<00:04:33.389> that<00:04:33.660> they've<00:04:33.840> been<00:04:33.960> doing<00:04:34.169> tests<00:04:34.710> on

got that they've been doing tests on

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:36.920 
got that they've been doing tests on
humans<00:04:35.039> to<00:04:35.430> try<00:04:35.639> make<00:04:35.819> them<00:04:35.940> better<00:04:36.120> you<00:04:36.810> know

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:36.930 
humans to try make them better you know

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:39.680 
humans to try make them better you know
maybe<00:04:37.199> make<00:04:37.590> them<00:04:37.620> more<00:04:38.180> military<00:04:39.180> you

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:39.690 
maybe make them more military you

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:41.629 
maybe make them more military you
putting<00:04:40.050> giant<00:04:40.560> guns<00:04:40.800> inside<00:04:41.160> their<00:04:41.370> arms

00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:41.639 
putting giant guns inside their arms

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:44.719 
putting giant guns inside their arms
like<00:04:41.880> have<00:04:42.449> you<00:04:42.599> seen<00:04:42.919> deus<00:04:43.919> ex<00:04:44.250> I<00:04:44.520> think

00:04:44.719 --> 00:04:44.729 
like have you seen deus ex I think

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:46.760 
like have you seen deus ex I think
that's<00:04:44.880> how<00:04:45.060> you<00:04:45.090> pronounce<00:04:45.210> it<00:04:45.660> but<00:04:45.770> they're

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:46.770 
that's how you pronounce it but they're

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:49.219 
that's how you pronounce it but they're
creating<00:04:47.729> robotic<00:04:48.150> body<00:04:48.360> part<00:04:48.630> of<00:04:48.780> guns<00:04:49.050> and

00:04:49.219 --> 00:04:49.229 
creating robotic body part of guns and

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:50.930 
creating robotic body part of guns and
there<00:04:49.410> are<00:04:49.560> other<00:04:49.710> stuff<00:04:49.919> maybe<00:04:50.699> they're

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:50.940 
there are other stuff maybe they're

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:53.150 
there are other stuff maybe they're
doing<00:04:51.180> that<00:04:51.419> I<00:04:51.660> mean<00:04:52.199> it's<00:04:52.349> a<00:04:52.380> bit<00:04:52.500> extreme<00:04:52.650> and

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:53.160 
doing that I mean it's a bit extreme and

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:56.629 
doing that I mean it's a bit extreme and
very<00:04:53.400> kind<00:04:53.759> of<00:04:54.319> very<00:04:55.319> imaginative<00:04:55.919> but<00:04:56.160> it's

00:04:56.629 --> 00:04:56.639 
very kind of very imaginative but it's

00:04:56.639 --> 00:04:58.460 
very kind of very imaginative but it's
that<00:04:57.330> there's<00:04:57.599> so<00:04:57.780> many<00:04:57.930> things<00:04:58.080> you<00:04:58.349> can

00:04:58.460 --> 00:04:58.470 
that there's so many things you can

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:00.529 
that there's so many things you can
branch<00:04:58.740> off<00:04:58.889> from<00:04:58.949> these<00:04:59.310> little<00:04:59.639> little

00:05:00.529 --> 00:05:00.539 
branch off from these little little

00:05:00.539 --> 00:05:01.999 
branch off from these little little
factors<00:05:01.020> that<00:05:01.169> you're<00:05:01.320> seeing<00:05:01.620> on<00:05:01.740> the<00:05:01.889> screen

00:05:01.999 --> 00:05:02.009 
factors that you're seeing on the screen

00:05:02.009 --> 00:05:03.560 
factors that you're seeing on the screen
