which<00:00:30.999> I<00:00:31.300> know<00:00:31.449> looks<00:00:32.079> a<00:00:32.230> little<00:00:32.320> weird<00:00:32.590> but

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:33.460 
which I know looks a little weird but

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:35.100 
which I know looks a little weird but
there's<00:00:33.880> a<00:00:34.000> really<00:00:34.150> good<00:00:34.420> reason<00:00:34.660> that<00:00:34.960> I'm

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:35.110 
there's a really good reason that I'm

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:38.150 
there's a really good reason that I'm
doing<00:00:35.350> it<00:00:35.880> so<00:00:36.880> this<00:00:37.030> goes<00:00:37.270> pretty<00:00:37.540> quickly

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
doing it so this goes pretty quickly

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.130 
doing it so this goes pretty quickly
some<00:00:39.160> of<00:00:39.190> it<00:00:39.460> might<00:00:39.640> go<00:00:39.910> all<00:00:40.450> over<00:00:40.510> the<00:00:40.900> place

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:41.140 
some of it might go all over the place

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:44.340 
some of it might go all over the place
but<00:00:41.500> that's<00:00:41.620> part<00:00:41.980> of<00:00:42.040> the<00:00:42.250> fun<00:00:42.990> and<00:00:43.990> I'm<00:00:44.320> just

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:44.350 
but that's part of the fun and I'm just

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:46.440 
but that's part of the fun and I'm just
going<00:00:44.710> to<00:00:44.740> grate<00:00:44.920> this<00:00:45.190> and<00:00:45.520> then<00:00:45.820> squeeze<00:00:46.270> the

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:46.450 
going to grate this and then squeeze the

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:48.180 
going to grate this and then squeeze the
