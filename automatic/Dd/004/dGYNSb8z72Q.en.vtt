remember this is a paint sealer we had

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.259 
remember this is a paint sealer we had
to<00:00:10.320> let<00:00:10.500> it<00:00:10.530> cure<00:00:11.130> dry<00:00:11.610> for<00:00:11.880> a<00:00:11.940> little<00:00:12.120> while

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
to let it cure dry for a little while

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:13.850 
to let it cure dry for a little while
before<00:00:12.450> we<00:00:12.630> can<00:00:12.690> go<00:00:12.840> ahead<00:00:12.929> and<00:00:13.080> remove<00:00:13.320> it<00:00:13.469> now

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
before we can go ahead and remove it now

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.499 
before we can go ahead and remove it now
it<00:00:14.099> says<00:00:14.280> about<00:00:14.429> 45<00:00:14.910> minutes<00:00:15.150> and<00:00:15.360> that's

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
it says about 45 minutes and that's

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.000 
it says about 45 minutes and that's
going<00:00:15.690> to<00:00:15.780> depend<00:00:15.870> on<00:00:16.260> the<00:00:16.410> conditions<00:00:16.859> you're

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
going to depend on the conditions you're

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.130 
going to depend on the conditions you're
in<00:00:17.160> but<00:00:17.820> there's<00:00:18.029> one<00:00:18.270> good<00:00:18.449> way<00:00:18.630> you<00:00:18.690> can<00:00:18.930> you

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
in but there's one good way you can you

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:20.480 
in but there's one good way you can you
check<00:00:19.470> to<00:00:19.619> make<00:00:19.740> sure<00:00:19.800> it's<00:00:20.039> ready<00:00:20.220> and<00:00:20.279> that's

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
check to make sure it's ready and that's

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.160 
check to make sure it's ready and that's
a<00:00:20.609> swipe<00:00:20.850> test<00:00:21.150> that's<00:00:21.390> right
