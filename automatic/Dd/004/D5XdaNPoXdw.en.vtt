 tasty snack 

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:17.690

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:19.060
 little salted herring or this recipe 

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:23.210
 i will need 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:26.960

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:45.079
 on the very smallest grater natra female 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:47.090
 on the color I rubbed on the smallest grater 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:50.270
 It turned out so it seems 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:53.000
 but the beet always gives a lot of juice 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:55.790
 so I'll put all the beets in such 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.460
 strainer and put in a deep plate 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:00.950

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:06.740
 juice it is drained so that then muse us not 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:09.770

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:41.740
 if the juice does not drain the appetizer in the end 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:45.070
