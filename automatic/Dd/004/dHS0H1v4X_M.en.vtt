00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:11.780
 take it when a person loses weight 

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:13.219
 then there is a burning process 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:16.200
 fat 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:22.519
 losing weight and there are consequences of this 

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:28.529
 process reduces the weight of the human body 

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:32.940
 exactly what is burning fat and if the mass 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.750
 human body is big not only due to 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.820
 fat 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:42.480
 but also due to muscle mass even in 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:46.910
 In this case, the weight of the human body 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:51.500
 reduced by burning fat 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:54.620
 but there is too much muscle mass 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:58.770
 weight loss goes much slower 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:01:01.739
 because losing weight comes after 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:05.990
 by reducing the amount of fat in 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:11.630
 human body in order to 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:14.550
 decreased muscle mass and many 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:17.490
 women doing physical education 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:21.480
 pumped up huge muscles because of this 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:25.950
 krupnovaty and hips krupnovaty and shoulders and 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:29.150
 I want to reduce them so that they 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:33.300
 decreased by given some time 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:35.610
 give up exercise from 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:37.560
 strength exercise from 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.590
 physical exercises that give 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:46.020
 large load must be abandoned 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:49.020
 some time it's about week 2 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:52.590
 and only after that the muscles will begin 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.600
 go and how do the muscles go and very 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.650
 simply 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:02:00.780
 muscle tissue which consists of protein 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:02.930
 gradually begins to be reborn in 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.310
 fatty tissue 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:08.250
 visually this is already noticeable 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:11.780
 the way that where the fabrics were before 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:15.100
 too dense they become soft 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:18.470
 what does it mean start to happen already 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:21.980
 degeneration of adipose tissue 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:25.959
 tissue and fat only 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:29.600
 burns and you father lose weight 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:32.410
 if during the weight loss man 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:34.940
 begins to study intensively 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:35.989
 exercise and with 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:40.060
 load 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:43.910
 then the fat burning process stops 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:46.850
 the fat starts to move into the giraffe in 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:48.620
 muscle tissue yes they are into full 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:54.400
 moreover , muscle tissue 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:57.890
 and how would be embedded between the layers 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:03:00.410
 muscle tissue gets fat 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:05.660
 fabric afterwards which is quite difficult 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:08.900
 from there pull out when the fat burns your 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:14.829
 the body then it turns into 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:18.950
 carbon dioxide and water fat burning it 

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:20.540
 the chemical process is the same that goes with 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:25.420
 plain gorenje 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:29.269
 oxidation due to oxygen 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:33.370
 oxidized fat is converted to carbon dioxide 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:37.160
 gas and turns into water 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:44.049
 consequently that fat well burned to you 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:47.540
 need more oxygen for that 

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:52.209
 it's not enough just to breathe air 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:52.209
 oxygenated for that
