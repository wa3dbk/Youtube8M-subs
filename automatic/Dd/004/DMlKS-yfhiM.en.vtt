00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:17.489 
it in half so I have them left with two

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:19.610 
it in half so I have them left with two
pieces<00:04:17.970> and<00:04:18.299> as<00:04:18.840> you<00:04:19.019> can<00:04:19.169> see<00:04:19.229> they<00:04:19.500> don't

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620 
pieces and as you can see they don't

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:22.460 
pieces and as you can see they don't
have<00:04:19.829> any<00:04:20.070> holes<00:04:20.400> in<00:04:20.609> them<00:04:20.850> you<00:04:21.780> can<00:04:21.810> buy<00:04:22.260> them

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:22.470 
have any holes in them you can buy them

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:24.170 
have any holes in them you can buy them
with<00:04:22.590> the<00:04:22.620> holes<00:04:22.919> already<00:04:23.220> put<00:04:23.550> in<00:04:23.729> them<00:04:23.940> I

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180 
with the holes already put in them I

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:27.260 
with the holes already put in them I
just<00:04:24.720> have<00:04:25.110> these<00:04:25.290> on<00:04:25.500> hand<00:04:25.770> already<00:04:26.190> and<00:04:26.520> you

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
just have these on hand already and you

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:29.150 
just have these on hand already and you
will<00:04:27.390> need<00:04:27.570> eight<00:04:27.840> of<00:04:28.020> the<00:04:28.229> jump<00:04:28.470> rings<00:04:28.770> total

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:29.160 
will need eight of the jump rings total

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.490 
will need eight of the jump rings total
to<00:04:30.090> open<00:04:30.300> the<00:04:30.390> Rings<00:04:30.600> you<00:04:30.720> just<00:04:30.990> put<00:04:31.200> it<00:04:31.289> on<00:04:31.350> the

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:31.500 
to open the Rings you just put it on the

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:34.670 
to open the Rings you just put it on the
pliers<00:04:31.830> and<00:04:32.010> then<00:04:32.370> open<00:04:32.880> the<00:04:33.090> pliers<00:04:33.500> I'll<00:04:34.500> be

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:34.680 
pliers and then open the pliers I'll be

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:39.469 
pliers and then open the pliers I'll be
looping<00:04:35.070> it<00:04:35.220> into<00:04:35.580> that<00:04:35.820> first<00:04:36.180> hole<00:04:38.270> I'll<00:04:39.270> be

00:04:39.469 --> 00:04:39.479 
looping it into that first hole I'll be

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:41.060 
looping it into that first hole I'll be
taking<00:04:39.780> the<00:04:39.870> shortest<00:04:40.229> piece<00:04:40.530> of<00:04:40.740> chain<00:04:41.039> and

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:41.070 
taking the shortest piece of chain and

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:43.400 
taking the shortest piece of chain and
loop<00:04:41.460> that<00:04:41.490> also<00:04:41.910> onto<00:04:42.539> the<00:04:42.660> ring<00:04:42.900> and<00:04:43.229> then

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:43.410 
loop that also onto the ring and then

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:50.860 
loop that also onto the ring and then
I'll<00:04:43.590> just<00:04:43.830> be<00:04:43.919> closing<00:04:44.490> that<00:04:44.640> with<00:04:44.940> my<00:04:45.210> pliers

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:50.870 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:53.360 

proceeding<00:04:51.870> on<00:04:52.020> to<00:04:52.139> the<00:04:52.350> next<00:04:52.530> hole<00:04:52.800> I'm<00:04:53.190> going

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:53.370 
proceeding on to the next hole I'm going

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:56.570 
proceeding on to the next hole I'm going
to<00:04:53.430> be<00:04:53.550> taking<00:04:53.940> the<00:04:54.169> next<00:04:55.169> shortest<00:04:55.860> piece<00:04:56.250> of

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:56.580 
to be taking the next shortest piece of

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:59.140 
to be taking the next shortest piece of
chain<00:04:57.150> and<00:04:57.180> doing<00:04:57.690> the<00:04:57.780> same<00:04:58.020> exact<00:04:58.410> thing<00:04:58.710> and

00:04:59.140 --> 00:04:59.150 
chain and doing the same exact thing and

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:02.420 
chain and doing the same exact thing and
then<00:05:00.150> just<00:05:00.479> working<00:05:00.750> my<00:05:01.050> way<00:05:01.080> up<00:05:01.289> to<00:05:02.010> the

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:02.430 
then just working my way up to the

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:04.520 
then just working my way up to the
fourteen<00:05:02.880> inch<00:05:03.150> chain<00:05:03.510> and<00:05:03.780> then<00:05:03.870> also<00:05:04.050> to<00:05:04.260> the

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:04.530 
fourteen inch chain and then also to the

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:11.029 
fourteen inch chain and then also to the
seventeen<00:05:05.010> inch<00:05:05.220> chain<00:05:09.590> when<00:05:10.590> all<00:05:10.770> four

00:05:11.029 --> 00:05:11.039 
seventeen inch chain when all four

00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:12.350 
seventeen inch chain when all four
chains<00:05:11.310> are<00:05:11.520> connected<00:05:11.940> they<00:05:12.090> should<00:05:12.270> look

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:12.360 
chains are connected they should look

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:14.540 
chains are connected they should look
something<00:05:12.630> like<00:05:12.780> this<00:05:13.169> with<00:05:14.160> the<00:05:14.280> clips

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:14.550 
something like this with the clips

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:15.890 
something like this with the clips
facing<00:05:15.000> inwards<00:05:15.419> I'm<00:05:15.630> going<00:05:15.780> to<00:05:15.840> be

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:15.900 
facing inwards I'm going to be

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:17.960 
facing inwards I'm going to be
connecting<00:05:16.380> the<00:05:16.560> chain<00:05:16.860> to<00:05:17.430> the<00:05:17.669> hole

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:17.970 
connecting the chain to the hole

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:20.930 
connecting the chain to the hole
directly<00:05:18.570> across<00:05:19.280> so<00:05:20.280> when<00:05:20.400> you're<00:05:20.520> done<00:05:20.669> each

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:20.940 
directly across so when you're done each

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:22.760 
directly across so when you're done each
chain<00:05:21.360> should<00:05:21.690> be<00:05:21.840> connected<00:05:22.380> directly

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:22.770 
chain should be connected directly

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:25.909 
chain should be connected directly
across<00:05:23.490> from<00:05:23.610> each<00:05:23.910> other<00:05:24.210> and<00:05:24.740> there<00:05:25.740> should

00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:25.919 
across from each other and there should

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:28.520 
across from each other and there should
be<00:05:25.950> no<00:05:26.039> tangles<00:05:26.880> this<00:05:27.840> is<00:05:27.990> what<00:05:28.139> your<00:05:28.260> chain

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:28.530 
be no tangles this is what your chain

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:30.020 
be no tangles this is what your chain
should<00:05:28.830> look<00:05:28.979> like<00:05:29.010> so<00:05:29.550> I'm<00:05:29.639> going<00:05:29.789> to<00:05:29.880> show

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:30.030 
should look like so I'm going to show

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:33.529 
should look like so I'm going to show
you<00:05:30.060> how<00:05:30.389> I<00:05:30.419> clip<00:05:30.930> it<00:05:30.960> in<00:05:31.880> to<00:05:32.880> apply<00:05:33.150> the<00:05:33.210> chain

00:05:33.529 --> 00:05:33.539 
you how I clip it in to apply the chain

00:05:33.539 --> 00:05:34.850 
you how I clip it in to apply the chain
I'm<00:05:33.720> going<00:05:33.840> to<00:05:33.900> put<00:05:34.050> it<00:05:34.169> right<00:05:34.409> over<00:05:34.470> the

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:43.370 
right underneath the hair tie and it's

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:44.710 
right underneath the hair tie and it's
going<00:05:43.550> to<00:05:43.610> stay<00:05:43.820> there<00:05:44.000> and<00:05:44.270> it<00:05:44.360> won't<00:05:44.510> go

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:44.720 
going to stay there and it won't go

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:50.500 
going to stay there and it won't go
anywhere<00:05:48.130> this<00:05:49.130> is<00:05:49.340> a<00:05:49.370> completed<00:05:49.790> look<00:05:50.090> I<00:05:50.300> hope
