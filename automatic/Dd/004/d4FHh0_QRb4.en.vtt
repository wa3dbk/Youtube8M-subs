00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
they're definitely like a transition

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.810

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.429 
do have threats they do leave like a lot
of<00:01:32.340> numbers<00:01:32.460> up<00:01:32.790> forward<00:01:33.270> so<00:01:33.420> just<00:01:33.630> locking

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
of numbers up forward so just locking

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.350 
of numbers up forward so just locking
out<00:01:34.740> their<00:01:35.009> transition<00:01:35.610> play<00:01:35.820> and<00:01:36.060> just<00:01:36.119> like

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
out their transition play and just like

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.940 
out their transition play and just like
being<00:01:36.630> ready<00:01:36.869> even<00:01:37.140> though<00:01:37.320> we<00:01:37.500> have<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:37.770> ball

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
being ready even though we have the ball

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.100 
being ready even though we have the ball
just<00:01:38.159> being<00:01:38.400> ready<00:01:38.610> of<00:01:38.759> our<00:01:38.970> position<00:01:39.450> so<00:01:39.930> when

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
just being ready of our position so when

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.380 
just being ready of our position so when
we<00:01:40.229> do<00:01:40.380> lose<00:01:40.890> about<00:01:41.159> we're<00:01:41.340> already<00:01:41.640> in<00:01:41.880> taffa

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
we do lose about we're already in taffa

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.330 
we do lose about we're already in taffa
and<00:01:42.509> I<00:01:42.840> think<00:01:43.380> that's<00:01:43.560> one<00:01:43.710> of<00:01:43.740> the<00:01:43.860> key

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
and I think that's one of the key

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.039 
and I think that's one of the key
strengths<00:01:44.640> is<00:01:44.820> and<00:01:45.149> set<00:01:45.450> pieces<00:01:45.659> they're

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
strengths is and set pieces they're

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.149 
strengths is and set pieces they're
really<00:01:46.290> if<00:01:46.380> they're<00:01:46.590> really<00:01:46.770> good<00:01:46.920> at<00:01:47.009> that

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
really if they're really good at that

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.520 
really if they're really good at that
too<00:01:47.399> upset<00:01:48.030> how<00:01:48.600> important<00:01:49.110> a<00:01:49.170> win<00:01:49.350> is
