because<00:01:48.720> you<00:01:48.930> can<00:01:49.200> see<00:01:49.380> mines<00:01:49.650> and<00:01:50.010> stuff<00:01:50.250> you

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
because you can see mines and stuff you

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.399 
because you can see mines and stuff you
can't<00:01:50.640> see<00:01:50.700> ores<00:01:51.030> but<00:01:51.270> it<00:01:51.570> is<00:01:51.690> really<00:01:52.049> useful

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
can't see ores but it is really useful

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
friend or something and he adds like a

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.320 
friend or something and he adds like a
hidden<00:01:55.979> base<00:01:56.369> or<00:01:56.700> something<00:01:56.909> that<00:01:57.119> you<00:01:57.180> want

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
to find you can see his chest or its

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.649 
to find you can see his chest or its
crafting<00:01:59.280> table<00:01:59.640> so<00:02:00.090> it's<00:02:00.240> pretty<00:02:00.390> useful

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
crafting table so it's pretty useful

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.140

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:03.150 
it's better than nothing so that's

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:04.940 
it's better than nothing so that's
pretty<00:02:03.420> much<00:02:03.600> how<00:02:03.869> you<00:02:03.930> do<00:02:04.260> it<00:02:04.409> guys<00:02:04.560> just<00:02:04.590> go
