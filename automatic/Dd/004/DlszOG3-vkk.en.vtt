00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
devices so let's have a look at just how

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.610 
devices so let's have a look at just how
easy<00:02:31.620> that<00:02:31.890> is<00:02:31.920> to<00:02:32.010> do<00:02:32.990> it's<00:02:33.990> perhaps<00:02:34.140> the<00:02:34.380> best

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
easy that is to do it's perhaps the best

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.080 
easy that is to do it's perhaps the best
thing<00:02:34.920> about<00:02:34.950> playing<00:02:35.250> memories<00:02:35.700> and<00:02:35.970> what<00:02:36.060> i

thing about playing memories and what i
call<00:02:36.390> its<00:02:36.540> demos<00:02:36.870> that<00:02:36.900> you<00:02:37.080> can<00:02:37.230> do<00:02:37.350> this

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
call its demos that you can do this

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.770 
call its demos that you can do this
store<00:02:37.710> is<00:02:38.190> to<00:02:38.370> demonstrate<00:02:38.550> just<00:02:39.180> how<00:02:39.330> good<00:02:39.630> it

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
store is to demonstrate just how good it

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.750 
store is to demonstrate just how good it
is<00:02:39.810> it<00:02:39.990> convergence<00:02:40.470> so<00:02:41.220> the<00:02:41.310> photo<00:02:41.490> that<00:02:41.670> the
