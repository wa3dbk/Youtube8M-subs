00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.240 
can adjust the depth of your cut you can
go<00:01:12.460> deeper<00:01:12.880> you<00:01:13.060> make<00:01:13.390> lighter<00:01:13.659> cuts<00:01:14.159> one<00:01:15.159> of

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:15.250 
go deeper you make lighter cuts one of

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:16.560 
go deeper you make lighter cuts one of
the<00:01:15.340> other<00:01:15.460> things<00:01:15.670> you<00:01:15.790> can<00:01:15.939> do<00:01:16.090> is<00:01:16.299> basically

the other things you can do is basically
sway<00:01:17.110> the<00:01:17.320> gouge<00:01:17.469> back<00:01:17.890> and<00:01:18.130> forth<00:01:18.460> and<00:01:18.939> kind

00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:19.119 
sway the gouge back and forth and kind

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:22.109

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:26.560 
cut that there's going to be deeper in

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.410 
cut that there's going to be deeper in
the<00:01:26.619> middle<00:01:26.860> and<00:01:27.040> lighter<00:01:27.610> on<00:01:27.729> the<00:01:27.850> edges<00:01:28.240> is

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:28.420 
the middle and lighter on the edges is

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.010 
the middle and lighter on the edges is
to<00:01:29.110> work<00:01:29.320> your<00:01:29.500> way<00:01:29.590> in<00:01:29.860> from<00:01:30.159> both<00:01:30.340> sides
