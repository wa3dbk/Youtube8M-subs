00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:20.000
 developed in the 1970s by the 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.960
 US and German customs 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.940
 the use of detector dogs 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.650
 narcotics responds today 

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:28.040
 still needs the services of 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.000
 police and customs around the world 

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:33.540
 dogs is a method 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.730
 effective and practical strengths 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.860
 indispensable their ability to detect 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.960
 is impressive but especially to 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.040
 accurately determine where 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.040
 are the illicit products 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:50.150
 thanks to its olfactory abilities 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:52.460
 exceptional the dog can not only 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:53.510
 detect narcotics but 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:55.310
 also odorous molecules 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:57.830
 specific as all kinds 

00:00:55.310 --> 00:01:00.290
 industrial explosives or 

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:03.190
 military and whatever their form 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:03.190
 or their presentation 

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:08.660
 the sense of smell and the most developed sense 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.700
 in the dog its olfactory system 

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:12.440
 contains about 800 million 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:15.710
 nerve endings capable of 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:17.930
 differentiate more than 500 thousand smells the 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:20.240
 area of ​​these receivers overlaps 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:22.280
 between 150 and 200 square centimeters 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.970
 according to the races whereas it is only 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:27.410
 5 to 10 square centimeters for the man 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:29.930
 finally the number of brain cells 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:31.910
 which differentiates odors and 40 times 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:33.920
 superior to the man which allows the 

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:35.180
 dog to detect for example a 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.920
 ammonia emanation 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:39.020
 even when diluting three 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.619
 cubic centimeters in a billion 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.619
 cubic meters of water 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:48.410
 unlike electronic systems 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:50.300
 or chemical explosive detection 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:52.280
 who are manipulated by the humans the 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:54.230
 alyzia safety dogs are trained to 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.510
 apprehend odors overall 

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:59.110
 of the area has secured and so sniff 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:59.110
 in all places 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.310
 same for systems of 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:06.630
 traditional x-ray detection 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:10.560
 the goods to be controlled must 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.610
 be routed to the scanner more 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.530
 convenient to use 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.930
 the cynical team moves 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.970
 to the place of security by 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.130
 elsewhere it is recognized that the level of 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.310
 detection of the dog is greater than that 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:24.690
 last generation machines 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.850
 dogs responsible for detecting 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:29.160
 explosives must not only have a 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:31.470
 good flair but still a temperament 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.620
 calm close to the master is extremely 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:36.510
 sociable 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.800
 for that after a rigorous selection 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:41.640
 they are trained in the center 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:43.350
 of learning the Bias are trained 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.850
 by qualified instructors and 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:46.770
 learn to recognize the many 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:50.730
 smells they will have to detect during 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:52.680
 future missions the drivers 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:55.050
 they receive training 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:58.200
 theoretical and practical particular to this 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:03:00.390
 occupation for a minimum of 22 weeks 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:02.250
 the dog driver couples get 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:04.760
 familiarize with each other and 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:06.720
 develops a true complicity 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.550
 together they make up a team 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:11.600
 solidarity willing to work in the 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:11.600

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:24.520
 in a package all conditions are 

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:30.310
 respected to leave the least 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:32.500
