00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:05.679
 How do you like my phallus man 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:26.930
 novel 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:28.790
 greet one and all swami friends 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:30.680
 skype and today we have another review 

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:32.480
 addon-items on garry's mod 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:35.450
 if you ever thought about 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:38.900
 deficiencies and lack of anything on 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:40.430
 weapons then this adam is perfect 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:42.710
 for you and for everyone 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:45.080
 after all given under the name of the loan amount from 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:47.390
 japan by the way link in description 

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:49.190
 adds the ability to hit 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:52.580
 anything on weapons but also a bunch 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:55.489
 other weapons besides standard let's 

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:58.550
 let's start go to the tab here the Japanese 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:01:01.280
 add new tab extensible whip 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:05.570
 angry here means a bunch of weapons of any 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:08.060
 weapons to your taste I choose Kalashik 47 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:10.009
 and then a little bit slept though and 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.830
 it was supposed to be like this 

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:16.220
 model Kalash as windows ktt right and so 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:18.440
 what happens if we run like this 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.600
 here we are realistic run with the breeze and 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:24.050
 generally very physically and cool 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:26.720
 unlike this some kind of physics we 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:27.799
 you can still kill anyone with 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.439
 this Kalash 

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:32.950
 and yes even on this weapon you can 

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:36.140
 aim at the right mouse button 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:39.049
 also changed the course moves as it were, 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.700
 rate of life cartridges so on 

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:43.759
 here in the left corner we have shown 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:46.490
 health and armor in right ammo and 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:49.189
 grenades and so on as well as 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:52.250
 conventional weapons such as Kalash and other things that 

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:54.079
 can drink so on there is still like 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:57.009
 we throw a and weapons if correct 

00:01:54.079 --> 00:02:00.350
 translate then there is armor and 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:03.590
 proper first aid kit as possible 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:05.450
 guess we throw the first-aid kit treat us if 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:08.060
 of course we will kill ourselves very much 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:08.960
 as you can see we are treated, moreover, she falls 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.450
 lies in the winter 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:13.640
 exactly if we throw armor then 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:17.000
 replenished armor which we can 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:20.450
 see clicking on the collage in the marvelous 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:23.930
 in tight ass clutches 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:25.730
 grenades are different and about web an attachment i 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:29.720
 I will not even press it now 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:31.850
 let's talk about it 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.150
 everyone has been waiting for what was created 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:35.240
 this 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:37.850
 Adam is an opportunity to press the c button 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:40.970
 or Russian and that's what we got 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:43.430
 it's just awesome we can now 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:45.020
 hang on arms all that we 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:47.120
 please but as you see 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:48.380
 now at the moment all these 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.010
 squares are surrounded 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:53.450
 red incomprehensible lines 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:55.790
 accordingly, we can do nothing 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:58.730
 hang on them so I did not try 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:00.500
 click to fix this 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:03.950
 problems we need to go in on tight ass 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:06.590
 ulykpan attachment and here let's 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:08.870
 do not suffer for a long time we will choose everything immediately 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:10.070
 I donâ€™t really know how they are 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:12.860
 call supplies 

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:15.080
 In general, something like this is now pushing the letter q 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:17.750
 and everything is available to us even though there is no top I 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:22.010
 somehow didn't pick up ok let's fill 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:24.590
 first the third is a laser sight like 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:25.220
 we see now on our little balls there 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:27.920
 here is such 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:28.700
 laser sight it's damn cool so 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:31.970
 activation 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:34.790
 It has become much more convenient but this is not all 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:37.760
 there is also a handle here 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:40.430
 which will reduce our home or 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:41.510
 scatter further let's fill two 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:44.840
 top pieces 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:47.930
 lamb by the way yes to fasten them all 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:51.430
 as you can see from above he says 1 2 3 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:53.660
 n we generally push 1 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:56.030
 get out it again press 1 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:59.540
 something is chosen from this one 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:00.830
 or if these are two different departments, then you can 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:02.720
 select several at once 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:05.239
 it is with this we now face well 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:07.310
 let's choose this scope and choose 

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:07.849
 is it our holographic sight if not 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:09.920
 am wrong 

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:11.720
 or here it will be well and graphic 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:13.880
 sight but in general it does not matter 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:16.489
 they are both holographic like this 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:18.380
 magnifying glass we by i now 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:19.700
 actually you ask me what 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:21.799
 this is the lowest 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:24.919
 erm she and lace but red 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:27.139
 squares well let's see it in 

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:30.229
 us called ammo cartridges 

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:32.540
 are also on tight ass and types 

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:35.840
 and here we choose everything we want, let's 

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:37.550
 choose cartridges magnum ul and so to speak 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:39.230
 our we picked them up 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:42.470
 that's written 

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:45.290
 taken to leave and so here already 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:49.640
 we have one tablet available now 

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:51.800
 will we recharge and noticeably 

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:54.380
 Damage increases and in general itself 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:57.200
 shooting that is now we kill him 

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:58.980
 just the first time we bring them in as 

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:01.840
 dogs 

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:05.470
 so okay I disgraced myself 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:07.120
 discharged all what's the difference better than them 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:09.250
 can finish off with our beloved 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:12.040
 arnova pistol well that's all 

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:14.410
 represented herself so what if 

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:17.350
 you liked it then like and
