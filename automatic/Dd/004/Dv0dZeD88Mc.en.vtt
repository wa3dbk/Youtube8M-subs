00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:13.049
 gameplay welcome to the first video of the 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:17.760
 Channel and I'll bring you guys today. 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:20.910
 an online gta kta-mata way too much 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:23.519
 fun to play now by choosing 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:26.910
 Anime, but there, I only have a gun. 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:29.039
 to change putting vest everything else 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:32.460
 although for the killing 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:36.239
 Let's kill everybody, then let's go there. 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:40.320
 People give you a tip. 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.969
 Just for you to watch l2, I do not think so. 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.090
 that everyone already knows 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:47.219
 No kills, it's no different 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:49.309
 It's just that you just get it. 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.239
 You have not seen any enemies. 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:53.370
 tightening r 2 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:57.600
 because sometimes the guy also hidden 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:01:00.059
 and even then the sight pulls at the guy then 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:03.000
 This is very good. 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:05.970
 many many of the people who play gt 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.350
 sometimes they do not know, and you can do it 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.350
 take advantage of this 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:17.430
 I do not know where it's right and if 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:22.610
 This killer must be what I'm playing. 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.610
 here but it seems to be a factory right. 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:33.689
 Daddy's watching right behind the wall. 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:36.450
 he pulled out the guy understood that it was a 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:38.970
 enemy is gone someone killed him right now 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.100
 You saw that it's quite easy, right? 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:48.960
 but if you have behind the wall he 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:52.380
 Also, there is someone there, or take it 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:55.439
 Shooting takes takes on the head then the tavinho 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:59.070
 people are very easy, very easy to 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:01.350
 you do not know is now I know 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:04.469
 I'm miranda if there was anyone here. 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:08.190
 He would have already pulled the sights. 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:09.160
 it would be very easy to find the players 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.520
 Anyone there? 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.520

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:44.780
 I was never on the subway. 

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:49.189

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:50.450

00:02:49.189 --> 00:02:54.859
