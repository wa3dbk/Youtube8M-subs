cool feature that and I'm not it's in

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:32.330 
cool feature that and I'm not it's in
mostly<00:03:29.170> like<00:03:29.470> all<00:03:29.709> the<00:03:29.920> new<00:03:30.120> nike<00:03:31.120> shoes<00:03:31.359> and

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
mostly like all the new nike shoes and

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:37.020 
mostly like all the new nike shoes and
um<00:03:33.340> that's<00:03:34.120> just<00:03:34.630> a<00:03:34.690> really<00:03:34.989> good<00:03:35.139> nike<00:03:36.030> idea

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:37.030 
um that's just a really good nike idea

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:40.770 
um that's just a really good nike idea
but<00:03:37.930> um<00:03:39.030> pretty<00:03:40.030> soon<00:03:40.209> they'll<00:03:40.450> probably<00:03:40.660> have

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:40.780 
but um pretty soon they'll probably have

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:42.500 
but um pretty soon they'll probably have
it<00:03:40.930> in<00:03:41.019> all<00:03:41.139> of<00:03:41.290> them<00:03:41.440> you<00:03:41.650> know<00:03:41.769> it's<00:03:42.040> just<00:03:42.220> uh

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
it in all of them you know it's just uh

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:45.270 
it in all of them you know it's just uh
that's<00:03:43.510> a<00:03:43.630> newer<00:03:43.810> thing<00:03:44.079> by<00:03:44.200> nike<00:03:44.560> and<00:03:44.769> so

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280 
that's a newer thing by nike and so

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:46.620 
that's a newer thing by nike and so
they're<00:03:45.459> just<00:03:45.670> starting<00:03:45.850> to<00:03:46.030> put<00:03:46.180> that<00:03:46.329> most

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:46.630 
they're just starting to put that most

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:49.590 
they're just starting to put that most
of<00:03:46.750> their<00:03:46.870> shoes<00:03:47.109> so<00:03:47.549> um<00:03:48.549> eventually<00:03:49.389> they'll

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:49.600 
of their shoes so um eventually they'll

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.720 
of their shoes so um eventually they'll
probably<00:03:50.230> have<00:03:50.349> it<00:03:50.530> in<00:03:50.620> all<00:03:50.709> of<00:03:50.859> them<00:03:50.980> but<00:03:51.519> also

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:51.730 
probably have it in all of them but also

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:54.780
