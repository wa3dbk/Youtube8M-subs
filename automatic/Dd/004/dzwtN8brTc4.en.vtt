00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
not exactly telling pretty right now but

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.330 
not exactly telling pretty right now but
it<00:01:47.579> wasn't<00:01:47.939> before<00:01:48.210> so<00:01:49.170> yeah<00:01:49.380> we<00:01:49.890> kept<00:01:50.100> like

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
it wasn't before so yeah we kept like

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.679 
it wasn't before so yeah we kept like
that<00:01:50.549> what<00:01:51.000> prettier<00:01:51.470> when<00:01:52.470> it<00:01:52.619> dries<00:01:53.689> okay

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
that what prettier when it dries okay

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.679 
that what prettier when it dries okay
and<00:01:54.930> yeah<00:01:55.710> so<00:01:56.219> that<00:01:56.549> I<00:01:56.820> just<00:01:57.210> shook<00:01:57.390> her<00:01:57.479> hair

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
and yeah so that I just shook her hair

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:00.170 
and yeah so that I just shook her hair
so<00:01:57.899> didn't<00:01:58.140> exactly<00:01:58.380> work<00:01:58.649> out<00:01:58.829> but<00:01:59.460> anyway

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
so didn't exactly work out but anyway

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.569 
so didn't exactly work out but anyway
you<00:02:00.240> get<00:02:00.509> my<00:02:00.630> drift<00:02:00.659> it<00:02:01.290> gets<00:02:01.590> curlier<00:02:02.250> and

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
you get my drift it gets curlier and

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:05.330 
you get my drift it gets curlier and
prettier<00:02:02.939> when<00:02:03.630> you<00:02:03.689> do<00:02:04.320> it<00:02:04.469> with<00:02:04.680> a<00:02:04.890> little

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
prettier when you do it with a little

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:06.470 
prettier when you do it with a little
bit<00:02:05.490> dry<00:02:05.700> hair

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:06.480 
bit dry hair

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:08.150 
bit dry hair
I<00:02:06.510> just<00:02:06.720> missed<00:02:06.930> it<00:02:07.080> a<00:02:07.230> little<00:02:07.710> more<00:02:07.950> than

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
I just missed it a little more than

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.580 
I just missed it a little more than
needed<00:02:08.580> to<00:02:08.760> so<00:02:09.120> it<00:02:09.360> definitely<00:02:09.900> turn<00:02:10.260> out<00:02:10.440> well

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
needed to so it definitely turn out well

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.790 
needed to so it definitely turn out well
but<00:02:11.060> one<00:02:12.060> that<00:02:12.240> once<00:02:12.570> that<00:02:12.870> drivable<00:02:13.500> and<00:02:13.620> say

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800
