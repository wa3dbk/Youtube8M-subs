half died because of errors and it's

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:39.460

precautions and so on no doctor in the
world<00:00:48.530> knows<00:00:49.340> about<00:00:49.370> all<00:00:49.880> this

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:50.680 
world knows about all this

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:54.550 
world knows about all this
so<00:00:51.680> they<00:00:52.460> give<00:00:52.790> patients<00:00:53.239> drugs<00:00:54.020> that<00:00:54.380> they

so they give patients drugs that they

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:56.530 
so they give patients drugs that they
should<00:00:54.800> not<00:00:54.950> have<00:00:55.160> given<00:00:55.370> them<00:00:55.700> that<00:00:55.880> interact

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:56.540 
should not have given them that interact

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:58.540 
should not have given them that interact
dangerously<00:00:57.230> with<00:00:57.410> other<00:00:57.680> drugs<00:00:58.040> or<00:00:58.309> food

dangerously with other drugs or food
items<00:00:59.000> or<00:00:59.210> so<00:00:59.420> on<00:00:59.570> and<00:00:59.860> then<00:01:00.860> the<00:01:01.010> patients<00:01:01.489> die

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:01.670 
items or so on and then the patients die

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.439 
items or so on and then the patients die
that's<00:01:02.090> the<00:01:02.329> other<00:01:02.450> half<00:01:03.100> so<00:01:04.100> the<00:01:05.089> other<00:01:05.210> thing

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:05.449 
that's the other half so the other thing

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:09.039 
that's the other half so the other thing

huge amount of corruption in in my
country<00:01:32.929> for<00:01:33.350> example<00:01:33.469> Denmark<00:01:34.219> we<00:01:35.029> are

00:01:35.139 --> 00:01:35.149 
country for example Denmark we are

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:37.120 
country for example Denmark we are
regarded<00:01:35.659> as<00:01:35.810> having<00:01:36.560> very<00:01:36.920> little

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.130 
regarded as having very little

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:40.870 
regarded as having very little
corruption<00:01:38.259> but<00:01:39.259> yet<00:01:39.560> we<00:01:39.770> have<00:01:39.799> thousands<00:01:40.759> of

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 
corruption but yet we have thousands of

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.419 
corruption but yet we have thousands of
doctors<00:01:41.119> on<00:01:41.539> industry<00:01:42.049> payroll<00:01:42.499> although<00:01:43.219> we

00:01:43.419 --> 00:01:43.429 
doctors on industry payroll although we

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:46.389 
doctors on industry payroll although we
are<00:01:43.579> just<00:01:43.880> twenty<00:01:44.240> thousand<00:01:44.689> doctors<00:01:45.189> so<00:01:46.189> this

00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:46.399 
are just twenty thousand doctors so this

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:49.359 
are just twenty thousand doctors so this
is<00:01:46.639> an<00:01:46.909> effective<00:01:47.420> kind<00:01:48.200> of<00:01:48.380> corruption<00:01:48.979> the

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:49.369 
is an effective kind of corruption the

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:51.429 
is an effective kind of corruption the
drug<00:01:49.579> industry<00:01:49.759> buys<00:01:50.240> the<00:01:50.479> professor's<00:01:51.049> first

so<00:02:15.980> many<00:02:16.100> drugs<00:02:16.490> because<00:02:16.910> so<00:02:17.150> many<00:02:17.300> died<00:02:17.960> from

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
so many drugs because so many died from

so many drugs because so many died from
the<00:02:19.010> drugs<00:02:19.250> they<00:02:19.490> take<00:02:19.520> in<00:02:19.970> my<00:02:20.900> country<00:02:21.310> people

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
the drugs they take in my country people

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.500 
the drugs they take in my country people
take<00:02:23.270> so<00:02:23.570> many<00:02:23.780> drugs<00:02:24.110> that<00:02:25.030> every<00:02:26.030> single

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
take so many drugs that every single

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:30.040 
take so many drugs that every single
citizen<00:02:27.190> can<00:02:28.190> be<00:02:28.370> in<00:02:28.430> treatment<00:02:28.790> with<00:02:29.330> one<00:02:29.870> and

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.050 
citizen can be in treatment with one and

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:33.160 
citizen can be in treatment with one and
a<00:02:30.110> half<00:02:30.440> drugs<00:02:30.860> from<00:02:31.850> they<00:02:32.060> are<00:02:32.180> born<00:02:32.480> till

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
a half drugs from they are born till

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:37.240 
a half drugs from they are born till
they<00:02:33.380> die<00:02:34.000> this<00:02:35.000> is<00:02:35.240> incredible<00:02:35.930> and<00:02:36.250> drugs

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
they die this is incredible and drugs

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.650 
they die this is incredible and drugs
are<00:02:37.550> not<00:02:37.760> that<00:02:38.030> helpful<00:02:38.330> and<00:02:40.060> they<00:02:41.060> kill<00:02:41.360> very

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:41.660 
are not that helpful and they kill very

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:45.490 
are not that helpful and they kill very
many<00:02:41.960> of<00:02:42.110> us<00:02:42.550> we<00:02:43.550> know<00:02:43.730> that<00:02:43.760> that's<00:02:44.480> why<00:02:44.720> drugs

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
many of us we know that that's why drugs

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.680 
many of us we know that that's why drugs
are<00:02:45.800> the<00:02:45.980> third<00:02:46.190> major<00:02:46.550> killer<00:02:46.970> after<00:02:47.210> heart

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 
are the third major killer after heart

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:50.980 
are the third major killer after heart
disease<00:02:48.020> and<00:02:48.230> cancer<00:02:48.700> so<00:02:49.700> what<00:02:50.060> we<00:02:50.270> need<00:02:50.630> in

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:50.990 
disease and cancer so what we need in

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:54.310 
disease and cancer so what we need in
the<00:02:51.200> coming<00:02:51.530> years<00:02:51.830> is<00:02:52.370> to<00:02:53.000> take<00:02:53.300> far<00:02:53.780> fewer

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:54.320 
the coming years is to take far fewer

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:58.150 
the coming years is to take far fewer
drugs<00:02:54.770> than<00:02:55.280> what<00:02:55.610> we<00:02:55.790> do<00:02:55.970> currently<00:02:56.920> if<00:02:57.920> we

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.160 
drugs than what we do currently if we

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:02.530 
drugs than what we do currently if we
did<00:02:58.340> that<00:02:58.550> and<00:02:58.820> we<00:02:59.200> were<00:03:00.200> careful<00:03:00.940> then<00:03:01.940> we

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 
did that and we were careful then we

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:05.700 
did that and we were careful then we
could<00:03:02.780> live<00:03:02.990> longer<00:03:03.260> and<00:03:03.620> live<00:03:04.460> better<00:03:04.760> lives

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:05.710 
could live longer and live better lives

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:09.090 
could live longer and live better lives
because<00:03:06.710> drugs<00:03:07.100> have<00:03:07.430> many<00:03:07.700> side<00:03:08.030> effects<00:03:08.480> and

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:09.100 
because drugs have many side effects and

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:12.850 
because drugs have many side effects and
patients<00:03:10.100> often<00:03:10.640> don't<00:03:10.850> realize<00:03:11.210> that<00:03:11.900> when

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:12.860 
patients often don't realize that when

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:14.860 
patients often don't realize that when
they<00:03:12.920> become<00:03:13.160> worse<00:03:13.790> that<00:03:14.300> it<00:03:14.450> could<00:03:14.660> be<00:03:14.840> a

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 
they become worse that it could be a

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:17.410 
they become worse that it could be a
side<00:03:15.200> effect<00:03:15.230> of<00:03:15.800> the<00:03:15.980> drug<00:03:16.280> which<00:03:17.180> they

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420 
side effect of the drug which they

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.060 
side effect of the drug which they
continue<00:03:17.959> taking<00:03:18.410> because<00:03:18.560> that's<00:03:18.890> what

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:19.070 
continue taking because that's what

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:22.150 
continue taking because that's what
their<00:03:19.250> doctors<00:03:19.670> tell<00:03:19.970> them<00:03:20.560> so<00:03:21.560> when<00:03:21.800> I<00:03:21.830> was<00:03:22.130> a

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:22.160 
their doctors tell them so when I was a

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:25.390 
their doctors tell them so when I was a
specialist<00:03:22.790> in<00:03:22.820> internal<00:03:23.090> medicine<00:03:24.370> what<00:03:25.370> I

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.400 
specialist in internal medicine what I

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.910 
specialist in internal medicine what I
very<00:03:25.700> often<00:03:25.940> did<00:03:26.360> was<00:03:26.690> that<00:03:27.020> I<00:03:27.080> stopped<00:03:27.590> a<00:03:27.770> lot

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:27.920 
very often did was that I stopped a lot

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.160 
very often did was that I stopped a lot
of<00:03:28.070> drugs<00:03:28.400> particularly<00:03:29.030> in<00:03:29.360> elderly<00:03:29.690> people

of drugs particularly in elderly people

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:33.520 
of drugs particularly in elderly people
and<00:03:30.520> it<00:03:31.520> is<00:03:31.880> quite<00:03:32.300> revealing<00:03:32.990> to<00:03:33.230> see<00:03:33.500> a

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:33.530 
and it is quite revealing to see a

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:46.250 
they take more than five drugs a day and

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:49.780 
they take more than five drugs a day and
we<00:04:47.150> actually<00:04:47.480> don't<00:04:48.260> know<00:04:48.530> how<00:04:49.190> these<00:04:49.490> drugs

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:49.790 
we actually don't know how these drugs

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:52.460 
interact with each other what we do know

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:54.610 
interact with each other what we do know
is<00:04:52.490> that<00:04:53.060> all<00:04:53.090> drugs<00:04:53.510> have<00:04:53.720> many<00:04:54.020> effects<00:04:54.440> in

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:54.620 
is that all drugs have many effects in

is that all drugs have many effects in
the<00:04:54.710> body<00:04:54.830> and<00:04:55.390> some<00:04:56.390> of<00:04:56.540> them<00:04:56.690> interact<00:04:57.200> also

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:57.710 
the body and some of them interact also

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:00.820 
the body and some of them interact also
in<00:04:58.040> their<00:04:58.400> metabolism<00:04:59.180> so<00:05:00.050> that<00:05:00.260> you<00:05:00.380> can<00:05:00.590> get

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:00.830 
in their metabolism so that you can get

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:03.130 
in their metabolism so that you can get
a<00:05:01.040> to<00:05:01.310> high<00:05:01.490> concentration<00:05:02.360> of<00:05:02.450> a<00:05:02.540> drug<00:05:02.780> if<00:05:02.990> you

a to high concentration of a drug if you

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:07.390 
a to high concentration of a drug if you
take<00:05:03.380> other<00:05:04.100> drugs<00:05:04.990> simultaneously<00:05:06.100> so<00:05:07.100> we

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:07.400 
take other drugs simultaneously so we

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:09.400 
take other drugs simultaneously so we
make<00:05:07.610> a<00:05:07.640> lot<00:05:07.970> of<00:05:08.030> harms<00:05:08.570> that<00:05:08.690> we<00:05:08.990> don't<00:05:09.230> even

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:09.410 
make a lot of harms that we don't even
