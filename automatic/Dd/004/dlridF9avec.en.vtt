00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:05.520
 after the killer and shadow full and nec 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.589
 the two big launch titles of the 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.599
 Playstation 4 last week already rather 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.490
 disappointed judges all world 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:15.150
 Of course, now look at the first 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.740
 play the xbox one of Rome should one 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.350
 the most important reasons for buying 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.119
 microsoft's new console will be the 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.039
 Roman legionaries of this heavy 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.660
 task can actually do justice or 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.269
 on the whole in a tragic 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:31.279
 Blood bath ends the experience in now 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.279
 my first next gen test 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.730
 be honest most of you have 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:51.440
 rise of rome but already long ago 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:53.390
 brutal graphic blender without 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.220
 stamped playful depression and 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.080
 although developer crytek is now 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:58.940
 really honestly endeavored after the 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:59.870
 measure this impression again 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.280
 dispel 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:04.490
 Now I have a little surprise 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:06.410
 for you skeptical because rise of Rome is 

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:08.240
 a brutal graphic blender without 

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:09.590
 playful depression but one 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.630
 bad history tells one must 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:13.100
 you tear son of rome while leaving it 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:15.080
 actually takes a while to get there 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.540
 sees through this great charade has since 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.860
 Alleluia looks good on this part of me 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.840
 I am usually nobody 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:22.670
 really of graphic details very much 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.190
 It was impressive in this case 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:27.530
 unlike the facial animations the 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:30.350
 textures of the shadow throw lives everywhere 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:32.150
 Stop this fat in gold shiny label 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.160
 nexgen that is really visual 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:36.380
 impressive when traveling microsoft 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:38.600
 actually only as an exhibit 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.550
 for the efficiency of the console 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.320
 When should serve xbox then this is 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:44.270
 mission in any case and indeed 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.830
 with bravour also playful white rice 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.840
 in the first moments really too 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:50.450
 convince her, mario plays his son 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:53.090
 a known or popular senator 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:55.040
 in rome and get into a real one right away 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.659
 epic big battle thrown in 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.790
 this battle should be the basics 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:00.620
 learn the combat system that goes like 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:01.940
 follows relatively simple you have one 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:02.750
 attack you can block you can 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:05.300
 dodge 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:07.610
 you can counter you have the opponent 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:09.290
 then sliced ​​down that far 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:10.489
 above him a small symbol appears 

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:12.650
 Are you ready for a so-called 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:14.810
 Execution, by the way, are bloody ones 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:17.060
 fischer with which you either then 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:19.400
 either your experience points yours 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:23.049
 focus makes your attack strength or 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.049
 replenish your health 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:29.500
 this brings you to your safety 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:32.380
 rooms no no 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:34.180
 the air here these first fights 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:35.980
 Really dynamic and extreme in times of crisis 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:37.930
 staged powerfully so I could do it 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:40.540
 hardly expect my kombo system on 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:42.310
 expand and with the help of new ones 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:43.750
 skills then ultimately always 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:46.450
 new adversary challenges too 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:48.070
 Sadly unfortunately this is unfortunately mastering 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.200
 these first moments are already 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:52.750
 Everything white has to offer playfully 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:54.220
 in the following three to four chapters 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:55.840
 I had to always the same opponents 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:57.430
 group with the same attacks 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.480
 in the same way 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:59.980
 defeat 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:02.560
 but not only that a bit sluggish 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.300
 fighting system and the big adversary poverty 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.100
 in rice provides with me over time 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:07.870
 for increasing boredom also otherwise 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:09.370
 There is not much in the game there is little 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:11.770
 change in this game 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:13.120
 that means the mission design is conceivable 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:15.970
 simple and the game world is one 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:18.310
 there are only linear level hose available 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:20.290
 only two new game elements the 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:22.360
 the printers will be in the course of 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:24.490
 time growing fighting something 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:26.260
 to loosen for one animal will 

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:28.300
 from the game at very specific places 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:30.850
 challenge you together with yours 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:32.140
 to put legionaries in such a line 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:34.090
 and you go into the so-called 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:35.800
 turtles formation you know that 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:38.709
 it must as the bombardment of 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:40.390
 bowmen meet you then moves 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:42.520
 together with the legionaries before or 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:44.800
 but you throw with spells that they are 

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:45.820
 both so cover or spear throw that 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:47.800
 we have the two options the these 

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:49.239
 Passages is not exactly what you are offering 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:51.760
 a lot but at least my little one 

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:55.600
 or you have to change one of 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:57.880
 many protected man and one not 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:59.260
 ending number of opponents 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:01.390
 take grain that's already in call of 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:03.489
 honestly, duty pretty lame though 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:05.530
 because at least it is spectacular here 

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:07.600
 just the expression of big ones 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:10.120
 ideas of the great ideas poverty the 

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:13.800
 this game prevails when nexgen 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:13.800
 Please be without me 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:27.690
 madl bavaria 

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:29.160
 who still hopes that the exciting 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:30.360
 boss fight the cart out of the dirt 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:32.970
 Unfortunately, it will also take a bit 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:34.590
 disappointed because there are three of them and 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:36.480
 they all leave something like boss 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:38.700
 design miss that usually means 

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:40.500
 even the simplest tactics are enough 

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:42.480
 to bring these bosses to the track 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:45.330
 they are exciting but staged 

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:46.800
 playfully again very very weak 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:48.570
 but not only the boss fights are 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:51.540
 in my opinion a bit too 

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:53.490
 lightly or too weak, designed generally 

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:55.260
 I had the feeling that when rice on 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:57.060
 the normal level of difficulty is one 

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.500
 there was not much of an imbalance 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:00.810
 is too easy because you have on the 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:02.760
 one side the possibility by so 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:04.560
 the points of experience you gain in 

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:05.880
 your skills so health or 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:06.960
 more focus and the like too 

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:08.700
 invest that means you will 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:10.920
 more powerful by the game but the 

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:12.990
 are always served the same opponent 

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:14.730
 you at some point overpowered then what about it 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:17.340
 leads me to feel under-challenged 

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:19.740
 have and here you notice again that 

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:21.840
 play more to it 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:23.960
 was interested in what it looks like and what 

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:25.650
 It celebrates visual brilliance in matters 

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:27.270
 rather than really looking at that 

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:29.160
 playful to concentrate on kicking 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:31.080
 because here rice is weakening all over 

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:33.120
 track remains the gossamer 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:35.580
 story the rice has to tell and 

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:36.900
 who is there gladiator or the like 

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:38.940
 he has already seen white 

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:41.880
 exactly what is expected for him here 

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:43.980
 times to pay for revenge operated that 

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:45.750
 means one gets here really 

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:47.580
 exchangeable revenge story itself 

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:49.560
 through the through the historical context 

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:50.640
 of course it does not meander 

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:52.170
 took care that somehow now 

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:54.210
 historically accurate who or so 

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:56.580
 I do not expect nonetheless 

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:58.080
 In spite of that I would have wished that me 

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:59.760
 the game packs more that me 

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:01.950
 history packs more marius stays with us 

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:04.530
 it is actually totally foreign to them 

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:06.480
 story of the good soldier of the am 

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:09.270
 the end does the right thing but as I said 

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:11.490
 just a revenge story and that has me so 

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:13.470
 bored as me the story of 

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:14.640
 The military shooter is often bored 

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:16.050
 there would also be this story 

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:18.330
 The proximity is there 

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:21.120
 really unmistakable so interchangeable 

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:22.500
 and staged a little grippingly solid 

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:24.840
 you say that really looks partial 

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:26.700
 the sequences look great and 

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:28.710
 the new setting is good the 

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:30.810
 German synchro is also good that is 

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:32.550
 there are always moments where the 

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:34.620
 Atmosphere is right where the game is 

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:36.180
 but reinzieht enthralling is not the 

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:39.350
 because it just has too little to tell 

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:39.350
 it stays that way too 

00:06:47.569 --> 00:06:51.990
 I think I have this game 

00:06:49.319 --> 00:06:54.120
 really celebrated this incredible 

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:56.340
 nice game if something a little more 

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:59.189
 but it would have offered playful 

00:06:56.340 --> 00:07:01.740
 unfortunately not and so were these five 

00:06:59.189 --> 00:07:04.050
 hours of play the sun of rome for 

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:06.060
 his truly exchangeable revenge is 

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:09.150
 At some point Tori will need a patience test 

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:10.620
 with me there is the fighting system of rise 

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:12.270
 of Rome in the course of the game as well as 

00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:14.370
 not developed at all and me 

00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:16.289
 crytek on otherwise just barely new 

00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:19.080
 to offer opponents or alternation 

00:07:16.289 --> 00:07:20.729
 has these great fights the 

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:22.409
 The game has this incredible dynamic 

00:07:20.729 --> 00:07:24.030
 and this enthralling staging that 

00:07:22.409 --> 00:07:25.650
 is slowly taking off that is it 

00:07:24.030 --> 00:07:27.150
 somehow burns out this fascination 

00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:28.099
 the fight at the beginning on me 

00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:30.900
 have exercised 

00:07:28.099 --> 00:07:32.879
 In addition, in the last third of the 

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:35.190
 then play a bit more 

00:07:32.879 --> 00:07:37.020
 backtracking and so on cooked arena 

00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:38.190
 Fighters have been waiting for me and there 

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:40.080
 then it was really for me a feeling 

00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:42.719
 the disappointment that I set 

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:44.550
 who last played like the mci or a 

00:07:42.719 --> 00:07:46.710
 has just played his must
