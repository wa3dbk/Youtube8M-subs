00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:46.829 
using iPhone apps well it's true Grover

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:48.619 
using iPhone apps well it's true Grover
in<00:02:46.920> fact<00:02:47.159> there<00:02:47.310> are<00:02:47.400> some<00:02:47.639> apps<00:02:47.849> and<00:02:48.209> you<00:02:48.510> know

00:02:48.619 --> 00:02:48.629 
in fact there are some apps and you know

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:53.420 
in fact there are some apps and you know
everybody<00:02:49.230> uses<00:02:49.760> not<00:02:50.760> apps<00:02:52.280> everyone<00:02:53.280> is

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
everybody uses not apps everyone is

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.050 
everybody uses not apps everyone is
doing<00:02:53.609> the<00:02:53.849> apps<00:02:54.090> no<00:02:54.840> I<00:02:55.019> am<00:02:55.290> talking<00:02:55.799> about
