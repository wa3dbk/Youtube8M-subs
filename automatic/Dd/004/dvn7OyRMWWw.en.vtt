00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:09.910
 hello my name is sylvie I am 

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:14.710
 accountant and I'm 50 years old at 

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:16.750
 March 2014 I'm doing two internships in 

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:19.240
 animal communication with the tile 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:22.350
 half but I will now open in 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:24.939
 share my experience 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.380
 so what were my fears or but 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:31.449
 barrier to communication 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:33.489
 animal before coming internship book the 

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:34.979
 animal communication for me it was 

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:37.829
 in fact a heart call 

00:00:34.979 --> 00:00:42.370
 after seeing a video on a leopard 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:45.100
 but it really touched me deeply 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:47.219
 and I 'm not questioned actually 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:51.069
 five minutes after watching this video 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:53.469
 I looked for who could teach me 

00:00:51.069 --> 00:00:55.899
 and that's where I actually found 

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:58.119
 karoubi so I was filled 

00:00:55.899 --> 00:01:00.249
 of enthusiasm and his few days 

00:00:58.119 --> 00:01:03.459
 only later than the first 

00:01:00.249 --> 00:01:04.960
 barriers actually to the mind on 

00:01:03.459 --> 00:01:07.829
 began to appear 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:10.619
 while it was things like 

00:01:07.829 --> 00:01:14.500
 but if I could not do it 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:17.789
 and if I get there in fact my game will be 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.789
 able to help the rings 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:26.820
 if he tell me about their suffering and 

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:29.469
 if it does not stop here here here 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:35.070
 continually there was always in 

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:38.289
 did something tell me here 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.899
 so what I thought I could 

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:42.909
 communicate easily but actually no 

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:44.469
 I was very afraid actually of not there 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:46.780
 happen but I believe the worst that 

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:48.819
 I was very scared of being the only one 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:50.649
 in chief of the group a failure to get there I 

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:52.590
 think I was not the only one to have 

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:55.259
 this fear 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:59.539
 and it brings us back it's like that 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:04.049
 always brought back this picture 

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:06.560
 tomorrow to the hosts and this scared back of 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.560
 to devalue 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:10.259
 while what about the experience that I have 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:12.090
 lived during the internship 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:14.459
 well it was a magical experience 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.319
 in fact because everything is simple and 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:19.230
 everything was easily really very 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:20.640
 easily the case of apprehensions she 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.250
 turns in the first practice of 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.380
 communicate that and it really gets 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:28.500
 a pleasure one day from the first 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:32.040
 practice everyone would be performing in 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:34.610
 done that is not able to get there and that 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.989
 it's magic 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:39.390
 so is it easy? 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:40.680
 yes it's really easy and I think 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.200
 sincerely that it's a sense with 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.840
 which we should actually operate 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:48.329
 from birth if he simply 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.920
 had settled and everything is there because 

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:52.260
 Caroline I think we bring nothing 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.239
 every year already she is content 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.720
 simply to reveal the modes 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:57.780
 job 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:59.690
 so it's kind of like I 'd say 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:03.180
 we were sitting in a super car 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:05.700
 with a key around the neck without knowing 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.430
 that if you use called me and 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:10.139
 well the car she reveals would submit 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:12.959
 lionel tiles ena for us 

00:03:10.139 --> 00:03:14.609
 explain the usefulness of calling it them 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:16.650
 uses that we can make of the 

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:19.680
 car is together we start the 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:22.760
 car then after well settles the 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:25.109
 drive or leave at the garage 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:27.000
 what did it bring me in the 

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:29.400
 life is good for me 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.410
 brought me not because I love 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.790
 communicate with animals and juice 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:35.250
 practice for me the most 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:37.590
 regularly possible when we 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:39.720
 communicate for me it's a bit like 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:41.700
 if we were in a cocoon ladies it's 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:43.980
 really a heart story that you 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:47.790
 makes more animal lovers startling 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:49.769
 incredible mourier that too completely 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:50.269
 changed in fact not vision half words me 

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:53.099
 missing 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:55.110
 each of them to a real 

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:58.050
 personality 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:59.640
 we have recent and they are really very 

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:02.040
 enthusiastic to communicate it's 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:04.530
 really something was happening 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:09.210
 really amazing and it's really in 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:10.620
 do something you feel then 

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:14.100
 today I perceive them a little bit 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:16.829
 like as a member actually to 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:18.390
 full share of a family I know for 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:19.230
 have already done it too I'm 

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:21.090
 able to help them 

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:22.800
 so sometimes it just takes 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:24.600
 explain things to them and problem 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:27.810
 disappears and it's the same with 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:31.140
 humans do I continue to 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:32.550
 communicate I am personally 

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:35.520
 continuously looking for animals 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:36.930
 to be able to practice I communicated 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:39.000
 with most animals from my 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:40.470
 colleagues and acquaintances and recently 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.450
 I also tried to help in the 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:44.669
 problem solving between the animal 

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:46.890
 and then there seems to be 

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:49.500
 exciting it's magical to see the 

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:50.970
 results we get this internship I 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:53.310
 thought of one of the most beautiful gifts I 

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:54.419
 I've never been and I'm very careful 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:56.370
 for my part to continue the 

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:58.470
 communication I really wish it 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:59.610
 become a meaning to parenty something 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:02.250
 of natural 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:03.840
 the two leaks of the month if we could 

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:05.430
 all communicate with the animals that 

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:07.790
 surround us I think our world 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:10.410
 is really good 

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:11.990
 Is it focused on 

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:15.780
 knowledge or my entourage 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:17.220
 so I did not see myself responding to 

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:18.120
 this question in fact that by extrapolating 

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:20.430
 the answer 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:22.650
 so I asked all those 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:26.160
 who accepted that I'm training in 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:29.010
 party with their animals and all that 

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:32.490
 for two months that I'm going from the 

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:34.790
 communication and lille in return I 

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:38.580
 would say is really very rewarding 

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:42.450
 so we are a fact is that the look 

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:45.810
 about their animal has changed and about 

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:48.960
 animals in general actually but some 

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:49.550
 also look at our way of 

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:51.630
 live 

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:53.550
 those for whom I did a job 

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:55.380
 problem solving feels 

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:57.710
 much closer to paradise 

00:05:55.380 --> 00:06:01.050
 it seems like they have a 

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:04.230
 complicity that has developed whatever 

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:07.050
 respondent thing of them there they 

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:11.070
 animal and that too towards their vision of 

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:13.260
 world and so they are much more 

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:16.620
 attentive g1 I noticed to their own 

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:18.030
 intuition also some french I 

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:21.240
 you can give one and those 

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:22.590
 who want to get started then I 

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:26.070
 would you say if you want to do then 

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:27.330
 well done I do not know if it's the most 

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:29.430
 nice gift you can make yourself 

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:32.190
 because it's nothing more than a story 

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:34.140
 of heart but if you feel that the 

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:36.480
 yours he feels like it then there is no 

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:38.760
 obstacle that will prevent you from going 

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:42.690
 your condition neither your age nor whatever 

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:44.250
 it's a beautiful adventure and 

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:46.470
 I really hope from the bottom of my heart that 

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:48.300
 day maybe not so far that it pays 

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:50.340
 children will learn from their parents 

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:52.710
 from a very young age but in fact I 

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:54.540
 think moussavi jorf then I would say 

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:55.860
 rather they will learn to develop 

00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:58.050
 this sense of communication 

00:06:55.860 --> 00:07:01.730
 but that day I think how I 

00:06:58.050 --> 00:07:01.730
 really believe in a better world 

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:09.390
 that's when I would like to say to all those 

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:11.460
 who want to do it go there be 

00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:13.200
 open and every but you'll see 

00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:15.840
 it's more beautiful gift than you can 

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:17.550
 do you do and I would like to say a big 

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:19.920
 thank you to me because she tile 

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:24.540
 really enriched my life in a way 

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:26.760
 incredible in excess there is 

00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:28.140
 really very very very happy then 

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:31.910
 thank you very much clermont for his 

00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:31.910
 wonderful gifts here 

00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:39.210
