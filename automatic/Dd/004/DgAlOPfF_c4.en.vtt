get a little bit more information on it
recently<00:01:37.520> I<00:01:37.579> figured<00:01:37.909> why<00:01:38.179> not<00:01:38.209> let's<00:01:38.719> do<00:01:38.899> all

00:01:39.099 --> 00:01:39.109 
recently I figured why not let's do all

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:41.319 
recently I figured why not let's do all
of<00:01:39.139> this<00:01:39.529> in<00:01:39.770> one<00:01:39.829> giant<00:01:40.490> video<00:01:40.759> for<00:01:41.179> you<00:01:41.299> guys

00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:41.329 
of this in one giant video for you guys

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:43.449 
of this in one giant video for you guys
so<00:01:42.170> let's<00:01:42.469> just<00:01:42.560> start<00:01:42.859> from<00:01:42.979> the<00:01:43.069> beginning<00:01:43.159> I

00:01:43.449 --> 00:01:43.459 
so let's just start from the beginning I

00:01:43.459 --> 00:01:45.489 
so let's just start from the beginning I
guess<00:01:43.639> what<00:01:43.939> is<00:01:44.119> day<00:01:44.389> zero<00:01:44.719> it's<00:01:44.990> a<00:01:45.349> promotion

00:01:45.489 --> 00:01:45.499 
guess what is day zero it's a promotion

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:47.230 
guess what is day zero it's a promotion
announced<00:01:46.310> from<00:01:46.429> the<00:01:46.549> multiplayer<00:01:47.090> reveal

which<00:01:47.599> is<00:01:47.749> what<00:01:48.170> is<00:01:48.289> now<00:01:48.469> almost<00:01:48.709> a<00:01:48.979> month<00:01:49.189> ago

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:49.369 
which is what is now almost a month ago

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:51.459 
which is what is now almost a month ago
crazy<00:01:49.729> to<00:01:49.939> think<00:01:49.969> about<00:01:50.359> but<00:01:50.959> anyone<00:01:51.319> who

00:01:51.459 --> 00:01:51.469 
crazy to think about but anyone who

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:53.139 
crazy to think about but anyone who
pre-ordered<00:01:52.009> advanced<00:01:52.369> warfare<00:01:52.789> would<00:01:53.029> be

00:01:53.139 --> 00:01:53.149 
pre-ordered advanced warfare would be

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:55.120 
pre-ordered advanced warfare would be
eligible<00:01:53.630> to<00:01:53.659> pick<00:01:54.079> up<00:01:54.229> and<00:01:54.439> play<00:01:54.679> their<00:01:54.889> copy

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.130 
eligible to pick up and play their copy

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:57.639 
eligible to pick up and play their copy
of<00:01:55.340> the<00:01:55.459> game<00:01:55.609> a<00:01:55.789> whole<00:01:56.119> day<00:01:56.419> early<00:01:56.959> than<00:01:57.439> those

00:01:57.639 --> 00:01:57.649 
of the game a whole day early than those

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:59.289 
of the game a whole day early than those
who<00:01:57.829> just<00:01:57.979> buy<00:01:58.189> it<00:01:58.249> on<00:01:58.459> launch<00:01:58.759> day<00:01:58.849> so<00:01:59.119> that's

00:01:59.289 --> 00:01:59.299 
who just buy it on launch day so that's

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:01.809 
who just buy it on launch day so that's
a<00:01:59.479> massive<00:01:59.869> pre-order<00:02:00.590> incentive<00:02:01.069> that<00:02:01.249> in<00:02:01.669> my

00:02:01.809 --> 00:02:01.819 
a massive pre-order incentive that in my

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:03.339 
a massive pre-order incentive that in my
mind<00:02:01.999> is<00:02:02.149> absolutely<00:02:02.659> brilliant<00:02:02.840> and<00:02:03.139> I<00:02:03.169> don't

00:02:03.339 --> 00:02:03.349 
mind is absolutely brilliant and I don't

00:02:03.349 --> 00:02:05.919 
mind is absolutely brilliant and I don't
see<00:02:03.590> why<00:02:03.829> a<00:02:03.859> decade-old<00:02:04.639> series<00:02:05.299> is<00:02:05.419> just

00:02:05.919 --> 00:02:05.929 
see why a decade-old series is just

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:08.230 
see why a decade-old series is just
doing<00:02:06.139> that<00:02:06.229> now<00:02:06.439> honestly<00:02:06.679> so<00:02:07.099> day<00:02:07.639> 0<00:02:07.969> is

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:08.240 
doing that now honestly so day 0 is

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:10.330 
doing that now honestly so day 0 is
specific<00:02:08.899> only<00:02:09.080> to<00:02:09.229> retailers<00:02:09.860> wherever<00:02:10.220> you

continued the bullet brass vibe and if
this<00:02:41.769> is<00:02:41.920> anything<00:02:42.159> what<00:02:42.640> our<00:02:42.760> gold<00:02:43.030> camo<00:02:43.269> will

00:02:43.589 --> 00:02:43.599

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:45.300 
this is anything what our gold camo will
look<00:02:43.840> like<00:02:44.019> assuming<00:02:44.799> the<00:02:44.889> bullet<00:02:45.129> brass

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
look like assuming the bullet brass

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.580 
look like assuming the bullet brass
isn't<00:02:45.579> the<00:02:45.819> replacement<00:02:46.420> for<00:02:46.569> gold<00:02:46.780> this<00:02:47.409> just

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
isn't the replacement for gold this just

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:49.110 
isn't the replacement for gold this just
looks<00:02:47.680> absolutely<00:02:48.129> awesome<00:02:48.370> and<00:02:48.879> I<00:02:48.909> can't

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
looks absolutely awesome and I can't

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.670 
looks absolutely awesome and I can't
wait<00:02:49.209> to<00:02:49.299> get<00:02:49.389> my<00:02:49.450> hands<00:02:49.750> on<00:02:49.930> them<00:02:50.049> now<00:02:50.200> the

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
wait to get my hands on them now the

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.349 
wait to get my hands on them now the
other<00:02:50.889> thing<00:02:51.250> that<00:02:51.430> will<00:02:51.819> be<00:02:51.939> visually

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:52.359 
other thing that will be visually

00:02:52.359 --> 00:02:54.240 
other thing that will be visually
different<00:02:52.569> is<00:02:52.870> the<00:02:53.170> game<00:02:53.469> casing<00:02:54.040> for

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
different is the game casing for

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:55.589 
different is the game casing for
advanced<00:02:54.519> warfare<00:02:54.909> the<00:02:55.030> game<00:02:55.180> case<00:02:55.359> will<00:02:55.569> be

00:02:55.589 --> 00:02:55.599 
advanced warfare the game case will be

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:57.780 
advanced warfare the game case will be
darker<00:02:56.079> and<00:02:56.230> more<00:02:56.260> epic<00:02:57.069> looking<00:02:57.370> version<00:02:57.519> in

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
darker and more epic looking version in

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:59.699 
darker and more epic looking version in
my<00:02:57.879> opinion<00:02:58.120> of<00:02:58.329> the<00:02:58.480> box<00:02:58.720> with<00:02:59.200> the<00:02:59.230> warding

00:02:59.699 --> 00:02:59.709 
my opinion of the box with the warding

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:02.129 
my opinion of the box with the warding
day<00:03:00.040> 0<00:03:00.400> on<00:03:00.639> it<00:03:00.909> so<00:03:01.090> personally<00:03:01.569> I<00:03:01.599> love<00:03:01.989> this

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:02.139 
day 0 on it so personally I love this

00:03:02.139 --> 00:03:03.839 
day 0 on it so personally I love this
one<00:03:02.379> and<00:03:02.530> I<00:03:02.560> think<00:03:02.799> the<00:03:02.889> standard<00:03:03.280> box<00:03:03.519> art

00:03:03.839 --> 00:03:03.849 
one and I think the standard box art

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:05.610 
one and I think the standard box art
just<00:03:04.299> gets<00:03:04.419> blown<00:03:04.659> out<00:03:04.810> of<00:03:04.840> the<00:03:04.930> water<00:03:04.989> by<00:03:05.409> this

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
just gets blown out of the water by this

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:06.960 
just gets blown out of the water by this
