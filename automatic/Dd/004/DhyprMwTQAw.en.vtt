this<00:00:05.790> is<00:00:06.029> from<00:00:06.270> mr.<00:00:06.720> beams.this<00:00:07.610> is<00:00:08.610> one<00:00:08.849> of

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
this is from mr. beams.this is one of

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.999 
this is from mr. beams.this is one of
their<00:00:09.240> lights<00:00:09.900> it's<00:00:10.790> 140<00:00:11.790> lumens<00:00:12.660> all<00:00:13.530> right

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
their lights it's 140 lumens all right

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.670 
their lights it's 140 lumens all right
not<00:00:14.610> only<00:00:14.759> that<00:00:14.940> is<00:00:15.240> a<00:00:15.660> motion<00:00:16.170> sensor<00:00:16.650> that

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
not only that is a motion sensor that

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.429 
not only that is a motion sensor that
works<00:00:17.010> for<00:00:17.400> 15<00:00:17.789> to<00:00:17.940> 30<00:00:17.970> feet<00:00:18.420> I<00:00:18.630> have<00:00:18.930> these<00:00:19.140> all

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
works for 15 to 30 feet I have these all

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.650 
works for 15 to 30 feet I have these all
around<00:00:19.770> my<00:00:19.980> house<00:00:20.250> if<00:00:20.609> you<00:00:20.850> want<00:00:21.060> perimeter

you<00:00:26.070> something<00:00:26.609> this<00:00:27.090> one<00:00:27.330> comes<00:00:27.570> with<00:00:27.660> a

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
you something this one comes with a

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.990 
you something this one comes with a
remote<00:00:28.199> control<00:00:28.230> it<00:00:28.890> works<00:00:29.130> from<00:00:29.340> a<00:00:29.519> range<00:00:29.789> of

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
remote control it works from a range of

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.659 
remote control it works from a range of
70<00:00:30.539> feet<00:00:30.810> I'm<00:00:31.439> here<00:00:31.619> to<00:00:31.740> tell<00:00:31.980> you<00:00:32.070> that<00:00:32.130> 70

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
70 feet I'm here to tell you that 70

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.240 
70 feet I'm here to tell you that 70
feet<00:00:32.940> is<00:00:33.540> it's<00:00:34.260> probably<00:00:34.500> more<00:00:34.950> than<00:00:35.190> that

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
feet is it's probably more than that

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.700 
feet is it's probably more than that
because<00:00:36.059> I<00:00:36.329> can<00:00:36.630> have<00:00:36.780> this<00:00:36.930> up<00:00:37.140> in<00:00:37.260> my<00:00:37.410> bedroom

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
and I can walk out front and it goes

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.280 
and I can walk out front and it goes
through<00:00:41.129> walls<00:00:41.399> and<00:00:42.120> press<00:00:42.360> the<00:00:42.570> on<00:00:42.690> button<00:00:42.719> it

through walls and press the on button it

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.979 
through walls and press the on button it
turns<00:00:43.530> on<00:00:43.829> you<00:00:44.789> can<00:00:44.969> also<00:00:45.120> set<00:00:45.600> the<00:00:45.780> brightness

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
turns on you can also set the brightness

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:52.069 
turns on you can also set the brightness
levels<00:00:47.510> like<00:00:48.510> that<00:00:49.309> and<00:00:50.309> not<00:00:51.239> only<00:00:51.360> that<00:00:51.510> you

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
levels like that and not only that you

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.880 
levels like that and not only that you
can<00:00:52.440> do<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:53.760> motion<00:00:54.149> sensing<00:00:54.629> and<00:00:54.930> set<00:00:55.710> that

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
can do the motion sensing and set that

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.740 
can do the motion sensing and set that
also<00:00:56.539> so<00:00:57.559> this<00:00:58.559> is<00:00:58.859> really<00:00:59.640> awesome<00:00:59.850> where<00:01:00.600> I'm

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
gonna do a review on all of my mr. beams

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.010 
gonna do a review on all of my mr. beams
products<00:01:05.640> because<00:01:06.000> all<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.479> mr.<00:01:06.810> beams

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
products because all the mr. beams

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.050 
products because all the mr. beams
products<00:01:07.560> I've<00:01:07.740> had<00:01:08.040> I<00:01:08.400> think<00:01:08.729> I've<00:01:09.030> changed

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
products I've had I think I've changed

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.330 
products I've had I think I've changed
the<00:01:09.510> batteries<00:01:10.080> and<00:01:10.439> a<00:01:10.560> few<00:01:10.830> of<00:01:10.950> them<00:01:11.130> but

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
the batteries and a few of them but

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.870 
the batteries and a few of them but
because<00:01:11.670> of<00:01:11.700> the<00:01:11.880> LED<00:01:12.330> technology<00:01:12.950> you<00:01:13.950> put<00:01:14.189> 3d

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
because of the LED technology you put 3d

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.210 
because of the LED technology you put 3d
cells<00:01:15.210> in<00:01:15.509> here<00:01:15.869> and<00:01:16.049> this<00:01:16.470> thing<00:01:16.710> you're<00:01:17.100> not

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
cells in here and this thing you're not

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.249 
cells in here and this thing you're not
have<00:01:17.369> to<00:01:17.520> worry<00:01:17.700> about<00:01:17.880> changing<00:01:18.720> out<00:01:19.080> the

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
have to worry about changing out the

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.260 
have to worry about changing out the
batteries<00:01:19.740> for<00:01:19.950> probably<00:01:20.310> two<00:01:20.580> years<00:01:20.610> and

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
batteries for probably two years and

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.359 
batteries for probably two years and
it's<00:01:21.869> gonna<00:01:22.020> work<00:01:22.320> every<00:01:22.619> time<00:01:22.770> someone<00:01:23.189> walks

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
it's gonna work every time someone walks

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.130 
it's gonna work every time someone walks
by<00:01:23.580> it<00:01:23.790> it's<00:01:24.210> gonna<00:01:24.299> work<00:01:24.540> every<00:01:24.810> time<00:01:24.960> you

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140
