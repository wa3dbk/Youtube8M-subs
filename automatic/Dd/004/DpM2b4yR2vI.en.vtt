00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.860
 I'm afraid of height, it's just one of mine 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:22.470
 phobias and I shell today and overcome it 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.920
 phobia fear of heights if honestly 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:29.100
 honestly if itâ€™s straightforwardly honest 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:33.689
 a little bit a little patch patch count 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:37.500
 let's say so that this bridge is tall 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:39.659
 somewhere probably 25-30 meters somewhere with 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.490
 seven eight storey house but eterna strongly 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:44.880
 to the fact that the sign is more than 8 floors I 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:48.049
 I think you understand it as it should 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:50.520
 be a little bit a little bit 

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:51.899
 a little bit of a fuck a little bit but 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.180
 principle, given that we are on Lazimov 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:56.009
 caves and other extreme places 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.899
