00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.469
 also very important in dogs that 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.740
 they have hip dysplasia is the 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:15.870
 passive movement of the joints 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:17.790
 as they make the step much smaller 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.610
 although it is very typical in dogs that 

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:23.580
 they have dysplasia in hour of coria that 

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:25.950
 they use the two hind legs at the same time 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.810
 that passive movement to improve the 

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:30.630
 mobility of the joints so that 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.070
 they do not lose mobility 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.250
 work articulation by the 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.250
 joint 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.680
 always supporting the knee the hand 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:43.400
 near the joint that we want 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:45.350
 work and we move it little by little 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:47.540
 Passive means that the dog 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:49.960
 it does not make any effort we do it all 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:49.960
 we 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.880
 we work the thyme 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:56.880
 knee 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:03.020
 always without stretching the leg 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:06.309
 only with the luck of the hands 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:06.309
 we got the extension 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.740
 and the passive movement of the hip here 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:17.290
 we have to be careful because it can 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:19.690
 be quite painful in some dogs 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:21.520
 especially the extension we do it very 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:23.259
 slowly 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.650
 and with time we are already winning 

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:28.500
 mobility in this joint 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.900
 you can also do traction is in the 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.610
 hip joint to improve 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.160
 a little the projection of the liquid 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.020
 synovial but it is not recommended that 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:38.730
 Do the owners in classes always 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.390
 better or what a specialist does 

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:44.780
 because you can do more harm than good 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.780
 in these 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:55.860
 and try to wait a little longer 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:55.860
 the bones in front and with the chalk 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:13.160
 all this is part of the exercises 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:15.410
 liabilities and asset exercises that 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:18.400
 they are also very important is 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:20.680
 to improve muscle mass 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.230
 stability and coordination of 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.599
 legs 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:27.989
 you can also use a table of 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:30.450
 bohler a trampoline hydrotherapy 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:32.700
 it also works quite well and improve 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:36.030
 muscle mass without harming the 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:38.220
 joints and another passive way of 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:41.340
 improve and increase muscle mass is 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:45.290
 electrotherapy to stimulate all the 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.290
 musculature and increase it
