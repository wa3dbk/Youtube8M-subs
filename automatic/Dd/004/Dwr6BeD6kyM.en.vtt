00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:12.070 
our amigos Pape here and welcome to the

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:14.879 
our amigos Pape here and welcome to the
second<00:00:12.490> episode<00:00:12.580> of<00:00:12.969> my<00:00:13.240> sniping<00:00:14.199> tutorial

00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:14.889 
second episode of my sniping tutorial

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:16.710 
second episode of my sniping tutorial
series<00:00:15.160> and<00:00:15.760> I<00:00:15.940> felt<00:00:16.150> I<00:00:16.209> couldn't<00:00:16.510> go<00:00:16.570> any

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:16.720 
series and I felt I couldn't go any

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:19.140 
series and I felt I couldn't go any
further<00:00:16.779> without<00:00:17.260> talking<00:00:17.920> about<00:00:18.220> Xero<00:00:18.550> so

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:19.150 
further without talking about Xero so

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
further without talking about Xero so
I'm<00:00:19.210> going<00:00:19.359> to<00:00:19.390> try<00:00:19.600> and<00:00:19.720> keep<00:00:19.810> this<00:00:19.960> video

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:20.170 
I'm going to try and keep this video

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:21.930 
I'm going to try and keep this video
short<00:00:20.410> and<00:00:21.160> to<00:00:21.340> the<00:00:21.370> point

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:21.940 
short and to the point

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:26.010 
short and to the point
what<00:00:22.600> is<00:00:22.900> zeroing<00:00:23.970> so<00:00:24.970> zeroing<00:00:25.510> means<00:00:25.780> that

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:26.020 
what is zeroing so zeroing means that

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:28.170 
what is zeroing so zeroing means that
you<00:00:26.230> are<00:00:26.530> setting<00:00:27.280> or<00:00:27.430> calibrating<00:00:28.150> your

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:28.180 
you are setting or calibrating your

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:31.170 
you are setting or calibrating your
weapon<00:00:28.810> to<00:00:29.380> hit<00:00:29.650> a<00:00:29.680> target<00:00:29.980> at<00:00:30.400> an<00:00:30.789> expected

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:31.180 
weapon to hit a target at an expected

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:33.299 
weapon to hit a target at an expected
point<00:00:31.660> so<00:00:32.110> you<00:00:32.169> do<00:00:32.349> not<00:00:32.529> have<00:00:32.739> to<00:00:32.860> take<00:00:33.039> into

00:00:33.299 --> 00:00:33.309 
point so you do not have to take into

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:35.220 
point so you do not have to take into
account<00:00:33.640> all<00:00:33.910> the<00:00:34.059> different<00:00:34.629> elements<00:00:34.780> of

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:35.230 
account all the different elements of

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:37.680 
account all the different elements of
physics<00:00:35.680> so<00:00:36.219> when<00:00:36.399> you<00:00:36.550> zero<00:00:36.879> a<00:00:36.969> weapon<00:00:37.510> if

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:37.690 
physics so when you zero a weapon if

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:40.439 
physics so when you zero a weapon if
it's<00:00:38.109> zeroed<00:00:38.710> correctly<00:00:39.339> your<00:00:39.819> projectile

00:00:40.439 --> 00:00:40.449 
it's zeroed correctly your projectile

00:00:40.449 --> 00:00:43.349 
it's zeroed correctly your projectile
will<00:00:40.749> go<00:00:40.960> exactly<00:00:41.379> where<00:00:42.309> you<00:00:42.489> are<00:00:42.519> aiming<00:00:42.760> as

00:00:43.349 --> 00:00:43.359 
will go exactly where you are aiming as

00:00:43.359 --> 00:00:45.630 
will go exactly where you are aiming as
you<00:00:43.600> know<00:00:43.780> in<00:00:43.929> battlefield<00:00:44.440> 4<00:00:44.530> and<00:00:45.010> in<00:00:45.399> other

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:45.640 
you know in battlefield 4 and in other

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.540 
you know in battlefield 4 and in other
iterations<00:00:46.479> of<00:00:46.600> the<00:00:46.749> Battlefield<00:00:47.319> series

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
iterations of the Battlefield series

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.879 
iterations of the Battlefield series
over<00:00:48.550> a<00:00:48.609> greater<00:00:49.030> distance<00:00:49.289> you<00:00:50.289> have<00:00:50.530> to<00:00:50.710> aim

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:50.889 
over a greater distance you have to aim

00:00:50.889 --> 00:00:53.160 
over a greater distance you have to aim
above<00:00:51.370> and<00:00:51.670> in<00:00:51.879> front<00:00:51.909> of<00:00:52.449> your<00:00:52.600> target<00:00:53.079> if

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:53.170 
above and in front of your target if

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:55.529 
above and in front of your target if
they're<00:00:53.379> moving<00:00:53.620> to<00:00:54.219> take<00:00:54.489> into<00:00:54.879> account<00:00:55.210> for

00:00:55.529 --> 00:00:55.539 
they're moving to take into account for

00:00:55.539 --> 00:00:57.329 
they're moving to take into account for
all<00:00:55.780> of<00:00:55.960> the<00:00:56.079> different<00:00:56.409> elements<00:00:56.530> of<00:00:56.949> physics

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:57.339 
all of the different elements of physics

00:00:57.339 --> 00:01:00.149 
all of the different elements of physics
so<00:00:58.179> basically<00:00:58.629> to<00:00:58.929> summarize<00:00:59.440> this<00:00:59.769> with

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:00.159 
so basically to summarize this with

00:01:00.159 --> 00:01:02.459 
so basically to summarize this with
zeroing<00:01:00.789> you<00:01:01.120> don't<00:01:01.389> need<00:01:01.569> to<00:01:01.690> aim<00:01:01.870> above<00:01:02.260> your

00:01:02.459 --> 00:01:02.469 
zeroing you don't need to aim above your

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:04.950 
zeroing you don't need to aim above your
target<00:01:02.739> zeroing<00:01:03.519> takes<00:01:03.940> into<00:01:04.390> account<00:01:04.420> the

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:04.960 
target zeroing takes into account the

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:06.930 
target zeroing takes into account the
bullet<00:01:05.260> drop<00:01:05.500> over<00:01:06.010> the<00:01:06.040> distance<00:01:06.580> in<00:01:06.790> which

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:06.940 
bullet drop over the distance in which

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:09.029 
bullet drop over the distance in which
you're<00:01:07.180> aiming<00:01:07.659> so<00:01:08.110> that<00:01:08.229> your<00:01:08.380> projectile

00:01:09.029 --> 00:01:09.039 
you're aiming so that your projectile

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:10.789 
you're aiming so that your projectile
knows<00:01:09.460> where<00:01:10.030> you're<00:01:10.149> aiming

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
knows where you're aiming

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.410 
knows where you're aiming
before<00:01:11.799> you<00:01:11.890> can<00:01:12.039> accurately<00:01:12.219> zero<00:01:13.149> your

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:13.420 
before you can accurately zero your

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:15.209 
before you can accurately zero your
weapon<00:01:13.750> onto<00:01:13.990> an<00:01:14.259> enemy<00:01:14.380> you<00:01:14.770> need<00:01:14.950> to<00:01:15.100> know

00:01:15.209 --> 00:01:15.219 
weapon onto an enemy you need to know

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:17.850 
weapon onto an enemy you need to know
how<00:01:15.460> far<00:01:15.789> away<00:01:16.119> from<00:01:16.149> you<00:01:16.509> they<00:01:16.659> are<00:01:16.840> there<00:01:17.619> are

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:17.860 
how far away from you they are there are

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:19.859 
how far away from you they are there are
a<00:01:17.890> number<00:01:18.009> of<00:01:18.340> ways<00:01:18.520> of<00:01:18.789> doing<00:01:18.939> this<00:01:19.299> for

00:01:19.859 --> 00:01:19.869 
a number of ways of doing this for

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:22.380 
a number of ways of doing this for
example<00:01:20.350> if<00:01:20.619> they<00:01:20.890> are<00:01:21.039> on<00:01:21.189> a<00:01:21.399> capture<00:01:21.969> flag<00:01:22.090> on

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:22.390 
example if they are on a capture flag on

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:25.469 
example if they are on a capture flag on
conquest<00:01:22.869> you<00:01:23.649> can<00:01:23.859> look<00:01:24.070> at<00:01:24.340> that<00:01:24.850> flag<00:01:25.210> and

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:25.479 
conquest you can look at that flag and

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:26.969 
conquest you can look at that flag and
on<00:01:25.689> your<00:01:25.869> HUD<00:01:26.079> it<00:01:26.350> will<00:01:26.469> tell<00:01:26.740> you<00:01:26.859> the

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:26.979 
on your HUD it will tell you the

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:29.240 
on your HUD it will tell you the
distance<00:01:27.310> between<00:01:27.549> you<00:01:28.090> and<00:01:28.119> that<00:01:28.750> flag

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
distance between you and that flag

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.249 
distance between you and that flag
however<00:01:30.250> there<00:01:30.789> are<00:01:30.909> two<00:01:31.180> more<00:01:31.630> accurate<00:01:32.109> ways

00:01:32.249 --> 00:01:32.259 
however there are two more accurate ways

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:34.679 
however there are two more accurate ways
of<00:01:32.500> doing<00:01:32.619> this<00:01:32.950> the<00:01:33.490> first<00:01:33.850> is<00:01:34.149> using<00:01:34.420> the

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:34.689 
of doing this the first is using the

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:37.499 
of doing this the first is using the
rangefinder<00:01:35.109> accessory<00:01:36.070> when<00:01:37.000> you<00:01:37.119> use<00:01:37.329> the

00:01:37.499 --> 00:01:37.509 
rangefinder accessory when you use the

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:39.330 
rangefinder accessory when you use the
rangefinder<00:01:37.899> accessory<00:01:38.649> it<00:01:38.829> will<00:01:38.920> tell<00:01:39.189> you

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:39.340 
rangefinder accessory it will tell you

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:41.310 
rangefinder accessory it will tell you
how<00:01:39.549> far<00:01:39.759> away<00:01:39.820> from<00:01:40.119> you<00:01:40.479> the<00:01:40.869> point<00:01:41.170> you<00:01:41.289> are

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:41.320 
how far away from you the point you are

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.469 
how far away from you the point you are
looking<00:01:41.679> at<00:01:41.829> is<00:01:42.070> so<00:01:42.640> therefore<00:01:43.060> you<00:01:43.210> will<00:01:43.299> know

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:43.479 
looking at is so therefore you will know

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:46.200 
looking at is so therefore you will know
the<00:01:43.630> distance<00:01:44.079> the<00:01:44.259> enemy<00:01:44.530> is<00:01:44.649> from<00:01:44.859> you<00:01:45.210> the

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.210 
the distance the enemy is from you the

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:48.149 
the distance the enemy is from you the
second<00:01:46.630> way<00:01:46.749> and<00:01:46.990> my<00:01:47.140> favorite<00:01:47.649> way<00:01:47.770> of<00:01:47.890> doing

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:48.159 
second way and my favorite way of doing

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:51.120 
second way and my favorite way of doing
so<00:01:48.369> is<00:01:48.399> using<00:01:48.820> the<00:01:49.030> PLD<00:01:49.630> binoculars<00:01:50.439> which<00:01:50.920> are

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.130 
so is using the PLD binoculars which are

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:53.399 
so is using the PLD binoculars which are
a<00:01:51.159> gadget<00:01:51.429> for<00:01:51.789> the<00:01:51.880> Recon<00:01:52.270> class<00:01:52.570> their

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:53.409 
a gadget for the Recon class their

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:55.319 
a gadget for the Recon class their
primary<00:01:53.829> use<00:01:54.009> is<00:01:54.039> to<00:01:54.310> lock<00:01:54.460> onto<00:01:54.670> and<00:01:54.939> target

00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:55.329 
primary use is to lock onto and target

00:01:55.329 --> 00:01:57.209 
primary use is to lock onto and target
vehicles<00:01:55.749> to<00:01:55.899> help<00:01:56.079> your<00:01:56.320> team<00:01:56.530> take<00:01:56.859> them<00:01:57.070> out

00:01:57.209 --> 00:01:57.219 
vehicles to help your team take them out

objects<00:02:00.729> are<00:02:00.909> from<00:02:01.149> you<00:02:01.299> and<00:02:01.600> it's<00:02:01.749> a<00:02:01.869> great

00:02:02.099 --> 00:02:02.109 
objects are from you and it's a great

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:04.410 
objects are from you and it's a great
way<00:02:02.319> of<00:02:02.469> telling<00:02:02.770> how<00:02:03.009> far<00:02:03.039> an<00:02:03.549> enemy<00:02:04.090> is<00:02:04.210> from

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:04.420 
way of telling how far an enemy is from

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.989 
way of telling how far an enemy is from
you<00:02:04.569> my<00:02:05.259> advice<00:02:05.590> would<00:02:05.799> be<00:02:05.859> to<00:02:06.009> always<00:02:06.280> point

00:02:06.989 --> 00:02:06.999 
you my advice would be to always point

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:08.700 
you my advice would be to always point
at<00:02:07.179> their<00:02:07.390> feet<00:02:07.659> to<00:02:07.899> judge<00:02:08.110> their<00:02:08.350> distance

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:08.710 
at their feet to judge their distance

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:10.499 
at their feet to judge their distance
because<00:02:09.250> if<00:02:09.369> you<00:02:09.460> point<00:02:09.700> at<00:02:09.910> their<00:02:10.060> head<00:02:10.270> you

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:10.509 
because if you point at their head you

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:12.780 
because if you point at their head you
may<00:02:10.929> end<00:02:11.110> up<00:02:11.290> pointing<00:02:11.500> at<00:02:11.800> the<00:02:11.920> ground<00:02:12.250> behind

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
may end up pointing at the ground behind

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:14.550 
may end up pointing at the ground behind
them<00:02:13.270> rather<00:02:13.840> than<00:02:14.080> getting<00:02:14.230> an<00:02:14.380> accurate

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
them rather than getting an accurate

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.020 
them rather than getting an accurate
point<00:02:15.010> of<00:02:15.250> where<00:02:15.850> they<00:02:16.030> are<00:02:16.060> distance

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
point of where they are distance

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:20.020 
point of where they are distance
from<00:02:17.690> you<00:02:17.930> so<00:02:18.710> in<00:02:18.860> this<00:02:18.980> example<00:02:19.160> here<00:02:19.820> I'm

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
from you so in this example here I'm

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:22.780 
from you so in this example here I'm
showing<00:02:20.450> you<00:02:20.630> me<00:02:21.470> aiming<00:02:22.040> at<00:02:22.220> the<00:02:22.400> enemy's

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
showing you me aiming at the enemy's

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:25.780 
showing you me aiming at the enemy's
head<00:02:23.090> but<00:02:23.420> I<00:02:23.570> do<00:02:23.720> not<00:02:24.110> zero<00:02:24.500> the<00:02:24.800> rifle<00:02:25.340> to<00:02:25.550> hit

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
head but I do not zero the rifle to hit

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:27.910 
head but I do not zero the rifle to hit
him<00:02:26.000> in<00:02:26.120> the<00:02:26.150> head<00:02:26.420> you<00:02:27.020> will<00:02:27.140> notice<00:02:27.590> that<00:02:27.620> the

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
him in the head you will notice that the

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.940 
him in the head you will notice that the
enemy<00:02:28.370> is<00:02:28.400> somewhere<00:02:28.970> around<00:02:29.560> 260<00:02:30.560> meters

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
enemy is somewhere around 260 meters

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.490 
enemy is somewhere around 260 meters
away<00:02:31.160> yet<00:02:31.790> that<00:02:31.970> bullet<00:02:32.420> hit<00:02:33.020> him<00:02:33.260> in<00:02:33.290> the

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
away yet that bullet hit him in the

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:34.240 
away yet that bullet hit him in the
belly

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
belly

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.930 
belly
now<00:02:35.150> with<00:02:35.780> the<00:02:35.930> rifle<00:02:36.320> zeroed<00:02:36.770> in<00:02:37.010> to<00:02:37.400> almost

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 
now with the rifle zeroed in to almost

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:40.480 
now with the rifle zeroed in to almost
the<00:02:38.240> correct<00:02:38.570> number<00:02:39.020> I<00:02:39.170> hit<00:02:39.830> the<00:02:39.980> enemy<00:02:40.310> in

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:40.490 
the correct number I hit the enemy in

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:48.070 
the correct number I hit the enemy in
the<00:02:40.670> head<00:02:40.910> killing<00:02:41.300> him<00:02:46.360> so<00:02:47.360> now<00:02:47.510> we<00:02:47.570> know<00:02:47.900> what

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:48.080 
the head killing him so now we know what

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:50.229 
the head killing him so now we know what
zeroing<00:02:48.740> is<00:02:48.920> and<00:02:49.160> I've<00:02:49.370> also<00:02:49.670> explained<00:02:50.090> how

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:50.239 
zeroing is and I've also explained how

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:52.390 
zeroing is and I've also explained how
to<00:02:50.450> judge<00:02:50.840> distance<00:02:51.440> in<00:02:51.709> three<00:02:51.980> different

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
to judge distance in three different

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.720 
to judge distance in three different
simple<00:02:52.820> ways<00:02:53.090> so<00:02:53.959> exactly<00:02:54.560> how<00:02:54.890> do<00:02:55.280> we<00:02:55.459> zero

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
simple ways so exactly how do we zero

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:58.150 
simple ways so exactly how do we zero
well<00:02:56.600> if<00:02:56.690> you<00:02:56.840> look<00:02:56.989> at<00:02:57.110> the<00:02:57.230> screen<00:02:57.530> now<00:02:57.860> I'll

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.160 
well if you look at the screen now I'll

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.790 
well if you look at the screen now I'll
put<00:02:58.520> a<00:02:58.550> red<00:02:58.820> circle<00:02:59.360> around<00:02:59.510> a<00:03:00.080> button<00:03:00.620> that

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:00.800 
put a red circle around a button that

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:03.460 
put a red circle around a button that
will<00:03:01.070> tell<00:03:01.340> you<00:03:01.580> exactly<00:03:02.090> how<00:03:02.330> are<00:03:02.510> you<00:03:02.570> zero

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470 
will tell you exactly how are you zero

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:05.830 
will tell you exactly how are you zero
now<00:03:04.040> my<00:03:04.340> key<00:03:04.670> binds<00:03:04.970> are<00:03:05.270> bound<00:03:05.510> to<00:03:05.720> be

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 
now my key binds are bound to be

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.840 
now my key binds are bound to be
different<00:03:06.200> to<00:03:06.320> yours<00:03:06.560> and<00:03:06.800> you<00:03:07.190> may<00:03:07.370> even<00:03:07.700> play

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:07.850 
different to yours and you may even play

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:09.880 
different to yours and you may even play
on<00:03:08.060> console<00:03:08.630> so<00:03:09.020> your<00:03:09.200> buttons<00:03:09.620> will<00:03:09.860> be

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:09.890 
on console so your buttons will be

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:12.150 
on console so your buttons will be
different<00:03:10.400> if<00:03:10.820> you<00:03:11.600> press<00:03:11.900> the<00:03:12.110> button

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.160 
different if you press the button

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.110

only<00:03:19.850> real<00:03:20.060> question<00:03:20.300> left<00:03:20.780> to<00:03:20.900> answer<00:03:21.080> is

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.530 
only real question left to answer is

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:24.610 
only real question left to answer is
what<00:03:21.830> to<00:03:22.070> do<00:03:22.280> if<00:03:22.610> the<00:03:23.150> enemy<00:03:23.600> is<00:03:23.780> a<00:03:24.019> distance

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:24.620 
what to do if the enemy is a distance

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:26.710 
what to do if the enemy is a distance
away<00:03:24.950> that<00:03:25.160> you<00:03:25.220> can't<00:03:25.580> exactly<00:03:26.030> zero<00:03:26.540> to

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 
away that you can't exactly zero to

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:31.210 
away that you can't exactly zero to
let's<00:03:27.380> say<00:03:27.590> for<00:03:27.769> example<00:03:28.209> 250<00:03:29.209> meters<00:03:29.630> or<00:03:30.220> 350

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:31.220 
let's say for example 250 meters or 350

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:34.720 
let's say for example 250 meters or 350
meters<00:03:31.580> or<00:03:32.380> 800<00:03:33.380> meters<00:03:33.739> it's<00:03:33.950> between<00:03:34.430> two

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:34.730 
meters or 800 meters it's between two

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:37.360 
meters or 800 meters it's between two
points<00:03:35.269> in<00:03:35.420> which<00:03:35.570> the<00:03:35.630> rifle<00:03:36.260> went<00:03:36.500> 0-2<00:03:36.980> in

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:37.370 
points in which the rifle went 0-2 in

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:40.750 
points in which the rifle went 0-2 in
those<00:03:38.030> cases<00:03:38.420> you<00:03:38.930> obviously<00:03:39.590> go<00:03:39.830> between<00:03:40.549> the

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 
those cases you obviously go between the

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.509 
those cases you obviously go between the
two<00:03:40.970> points<00:03:41.480> and<00:03:41.630> Eve<00:03:41.959> aim<00:03:42.380> above<00:03:42.890> your<00:03:43.280> target

00:03:43.509 --> 00:03:43.519 
two points and Eve aim above your target

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:46.420 
two points and Eve aim above your target
or<00:03:43.910> below<00:03:44.269> so<00:03:45.080> for<00:03:45.260> example<00:03:45.739> if<00:03:45.890> your<00:03:46.130> target

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430 
or below so for example if your target

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:51.190 
or below so for example if your target
is<00:03:47.079> 900<00:03:48.079> meters<00:03:48.470> away<00:03:48.799> you<00:03:49.190> could<00:03:49.370> 0<00:03:49.700> to<00:03:50.200> 1000

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:51.200 
is 900 meters away you could 0 to 1000

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.860 
is 900 meters away you could 0 to 1000
meters<00:03:51.680> but<00:03:52.100> instead<00:03:52.489> of<00:03:52.579> aiming<00:03:53.000> exactly<00:03:53.660> at

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:53.870 
meters but instead of aiming exactly at

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:56.430 
meters but instead of aiming exactly at
his<00:03:54.079> head<00:03:54.320> perhaps<00:03:54.769> you'll<00:03:55.010> aim<00:03:55.370> at<00:03:55.670> his<00:03:55.910> torso

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:56.440 
his head perhaps you'll aim at his torso

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:58.900 
his head perhaps you'll aim at his torso
this<00:03:57.440> takes<00:03:57.980> a<00:03:58.160> little<00:03:58.310> bit<00:03:58.519> of<00:03:58.579> getting<00:03:58.820> used
