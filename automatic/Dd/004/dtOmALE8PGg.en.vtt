00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
game against sunderland and what a

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.340 
game against sunderland and what a
free-kick<00:02:28.830> that<00:02:29.250> was<00:02:29.750> over<00:02:30.750> the<00:02:30.870> wall<00:02:31.050> into

free-kick that was over the wall into
the<00:02:31.680> top<00:02:31.950> corner<00:02:31.980> perfectly<00:02:32.819> placed<00:02:33.569> no

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.020

chance<00:02:34.410> from<00:02:34.650> the<00:02:34.770> keeper<00:02:35.010> and<00:02:35.340> it's<00:02:36.060> just

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:36.569 
chance from the keeper and it's just

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:39.470 
chance from the keeper and it's just
under<00:02:36.930> the<00:02:37.200> crossbar<00:02:37.370> next<00:02:38.370> to<00:02:38.459> the<00:02:38.580> post<00:02:38.880> it

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
under the crossbar next to the post it

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.240 
under the crossbar next to the post it
doesn't<00:02:39.840> get<00:02:39.959> placed<00:02:40.230> much<00:02:40.560> better<00:02:40.890> than<00:02:41.069> that

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
doesn't get placed much better than that

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.479 
doesn't get placed much better than that
what<00:02:41.850> a<00:02:41.880> beauty<00:02:42.540> of<00:02:42.660> a<00:02:42.750> free-kick<00:02:43.560> and<00:02:44.099> he<00:02:44.220> did

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
what a beauty of a free-kick and he did

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:46.100 
what a beauty of a free-kick and he did
actually<00:02:44.670> also<00:02:44.910> score<00:02:45.269> one<00:02:45.450> in<00:02:45.569> real<00:02:45.750> life<00:02:45.959> in

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
actually also score one in real life in

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:47.809 
actually also score one in real life in
the<00:02:46.200> Premier<00:02:46.470> League<00:02:46.709> so<00:02:47.190> I<00:02:47.220> guess<00:02:47.550> it<00:02:47.670> makes

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:47.819 
the Premier League so I guess it makes

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:49.550 
the Premier League so I guess it makes
sense<00:02:47.940> he's<00:02:48.269> also<00:02:48.480> capable<00:02:49.019> of<00:02:49.140> pulling<00:02:49.380> it

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
sense he's also capable of pulling it

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.470 
sense he's also capable of pulling it
off<00:02:49.709> in<00:02:49.950> the<00:02:50.160> game<00:02:50.400> cranch<00:02:50.790> out<00:02:51.060> there<00:02:51.239> and

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
off in the game cranch out there and

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.930 
off in the game cranch out there and
apart<00:02:52.380> from<00:02:52.440> that<00:02:52.560> here<00:02:53.010> was<00:02:53.160> the<00:02:53.310> only<00:02:53.549> shot

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
apart from that here was the only shot

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.940 
apart from that here was the only shot
Sunderland<00:02:54.569> had<00:02:54.810> an<00:02:54.989> entire<00:02:55.410> game<00:02:55.739> they<00:02:55.890> were

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
Sunderland had an entire game they were

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.460 
Sunderland had an entire game they were
one<00:02:56.190> man<00:02:56.400> down<00:02:56.640> didn't<00:02:57.090> create<00:02:57.269> much<00:02:57.480> and<00:02:57.780> I

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
one man down didn't create much and I

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.800 
one man down didn't create much and I
was<00:02:58.680> able<00:02:58.920> to<00:02:59.160> win<00:02:59.459> the<00:02:59.489> game<00:02:59.790> in<00:03:00.000> the<00:03:00.299> end<00:03:00.510> on

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
was able to win the game in the end on

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.320 
was able to win the game in the end on
that<00:03:01.319> on<00:03:01.860> that<00:03:01.890> free-kick<00:03:02.610> so<00:03:02.850> we<00:03:03.000> move<00:03:03.180> on

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
that on that free-kick so we move on

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:04.520 
that on that free-kick so we move on
through<00:03:03.480> into<00:03:03.660> the<00:03:03.840> next<00:03:04.080> round<00:03:04.230> off<00:03:04.470> the

through into the next round off the
capital<00:03:05.130> one<00:03:05.340> cup<00:03:05.580> and<00:03:06.049> apart<00:03:07.049> from<00:03:07.110> now<00:03:07.380> we

pretty<00:07:06.540> good<00:07:07.020> we<00:07:07.230> undefeated<00:07:07.950> in<00:07:08.070> the<00:07:08.100> Premier

00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:08.550 
pretty good we undefeated in the Premier

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:11.180 
pretty good we undefeated in the Premier
League<00:07:08.580> but<00:07:08.970> once<00:07:09.210> we<00:07:09.840> face<00:07:10.080> the<00:07:10.290> likes<00:07:10.530> of<00:07:10.830> as

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:11.190

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:14.490 
a set City Chelsea Arsenal I think

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:16.520

00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:18.080 
you'll probably started dropping some
more<00:07:16.710> points<00:07:16.950> and<00:07:17.280> maybe<00:07:17.430> I<00:07:17.550> should<00:07:17.760> pump<00:07:17.940> it

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:18.090
