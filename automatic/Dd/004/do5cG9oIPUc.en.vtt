00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
high black I honestly thought that we

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.440 
high black I honestly thought that we
were<00:01:30.450> going<00:01:30.630> to<00:01:30.720> lose<00:01:30.840> but<00:01:31.939> we<00:01:32.939> didn't<00:01:33.270> give<00:01:33.420> up

and<00:01:33.840> we<00:01:34.049> won<00:01:34.290> which<00:01:34.829> is<00:01:35.009> basically<00:01:35.369> what<00:01:36.049> I've

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
and we won which is basically what I've

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.649 
and we won which is basically what I've
learned<00:01:37.380> just<00:01:37.770> make<00:01:37.979> sure<00:01:38.220> that<00:01:38.970> ID<00:01:39.180> don't

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
learned just make sure that ID don't

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.880
