point is I'm going to from the PC just
start<00:02:28.190> my<00:02:29.190> camera<00:02:29.610> using<00:02:30.510> the<00:02:30.570> same<00:02:30.810> workflow

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
start my camera using the same workflow

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:32.240 
start my camera using the same workflow
that<00:02:31.350> I<00:02:31.440> would<00:02:31.590> do<00:02:31.650> if<00:02:31.770> I<00:02:31.830> was<00:02:31.950> sitting<00:02:32.070> at<00:02:32.220> my

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
that I would do if I was sitting at my

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.190 
that I would do if I was sitting at my
desk<00:02:32.490> and<00:02:32.760> again<00:02:32.940> the<00:02:33.060> benefit<00:02:33.810> of<00:02:34.020> this

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
desk and again the benefit of this

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.260 
desk and again the benefit of this
scenario<00:02:34.530> is<00:02:34.920> you<00:02:35.400> know<00:02:35.490> I<00:02:35.550> am<00:02:35.850> doing<00:02:36.150> nothing
