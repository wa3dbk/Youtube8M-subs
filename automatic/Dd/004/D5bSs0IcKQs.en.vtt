and so when you hit the buzz button your

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:06.300 
and so when you hit the buzz button your
actual<00:02:05.020> your<00:02:05.140> dog<00:02:05.290> will<00:02:05.560> hear<00:02:05.799> like<00:02:05.950> a<00:02:05.979> buzzing

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
got this exact same collar on everything

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:42.399 
got this exact same collar on everything
from<00:02:40.340> six<00:02:40.730> and<00:02:40.879> a<00:02:40.909> half<00:02:40.939> pound<00:02:41.329> dogs<00:02:41.599> all<00:02:41.900> the

00:02:42.399 --> 00:02:42.409 
from six and a half pound dogs all the

00:02:42.409 --> 00:02:44.349 
from six and a half pound dogs all the
way<00:02:42.560> up<00:02:42.680> to<00:02:42.709> massive<00:02:43.370> okay<00:02:43.790> and<00:02:43.909> everything<00:02:44.239> in

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:44.359 
way up to massive okay and everything in

00:02:44.359 --> 00:02:46.210 
way up to massive okay and everything in
between<00:02:44.420> so<00:02:45.200> it<00:02:45.319> works<00:02:45.500> out<00:02:45.680> really<00:02:45.890> well<00:02:46.010> for

of these units are rechargeable so the

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:54.429 
of these units are rechargeable so the
collar<00:02:53.090> and<00:02:53.269> the<00:02:53.569> remote<00:02:53.900> are<00:02:54.079> actually

collar and the remote are actually
rechargeable<00:02:55.069> so<00:02:55.220> that's<00:02:55.370> kind<00:02:55.579> of<00:02:55.640> nice<00:02:56.440> some

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 
rechargeable so that's kind of nice some

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.229 
rechargeable so that's kind of nice some
of<00:02:57.560> the<00:02:57.620> features<00:02:57.829> that<00:02:58.129> you<00:02:58.280> have<00:02:58.489> on<00:02:58.760> the

00:02:59.229 --> 00:02:59.239 
of the features that you have on the

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:01.300 
of the features that you have on the
remotes<00:02:59.720> there's<00:03:00.530> a<00:03:00.590> hundred<00:03:00.920> and<00:03:00.980> twenty

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
at zero and go all the way up to 127 the

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.210 
at zero and go all the way up to 127 the
nice<00:03:11.329> thing<00:03:11.359> about<00:03:11.599> that<00:03:11.989> is<00:03:12.049> is<00:03:12.500> the<00:03:12.859> level<00:03:13.129> of

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
nice thing about that is is the level of

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.429 
nice thing about that is is the level of
intensity<00:03:13.519> change<00:03:13.970> between<00:03:14.299> a1<00:03:14.510> and<00:03:14.750> a2<00:03:14.930> is

00:03:15.429 --> 00:03:15.439 
intensity change between a1 and a2 is

00:03:15.439 --> 00:03:17.199 
intensity change between a1 and a2 is
the<00:03:15.859> same<00:03:16.069> level<00:03:16.459> of<00:03:16.549> intensity<00:03:16.819> change

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:17.209 
the same level of intensity change

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:20.259 
the same level of intensity change
between<00:03:17.450> 126<00:03:18.290> 127<00:03:19.220> so<00:03:19.639> it's<00:03:19.790> just<00:03:19.849> a<00:03:20.030> steady

00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:20.269 
between 126 127 so it's just a steady

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:22.809 
between 126 127 so it's just a steady
progressive<00:03:20.870> incline<00:03:21.379> all<00:03:22.189> the<00:03:22.400> way<00:03:22.519> up<00:03:22.639> from

00:03:22.809 --> 00:03:22.819 
progressive incline all the way up from

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:25.330 
progressive incline all the way up from
zero<00:03:23.090> all<00:03:23.299> the<00:03:23.420> way<00:03:23.510> up<00:03:23.599> to<00:03:23.629> 127<00:03:24.260> so<00:03:25.010> you<00:03:25.099> can

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
zero all the way up to 127 so you can

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:26.879 
zero all the way up to 127 so you can
kind<00:03:25.519> of<00:03:25.579> find<00:03:25.760> you<00:03:25.970> can<00:03:26.120> kind<00:03:26.299> of<00:03:26.329> fine<00:03:26.629> tune

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:26.889 
kind of find you can kind of fine tune

00:03:26.889 --> 00:03:29.530 
kind of find you can kind of fine tune

there's a few different buttons on the
collar<00:03:38.180> it's<00:03:38.449> are<00:03:38.750> on<00:03:38.870> the<00:03:38.959> remote<00:03:39.230> itself<00:03:39.650> one

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:39.889 
collar it's are on the remote itself one

00:03:39.889 --> 00:03:41.949 
collar it's are on the remote itself one
as<00:03:40.010> a<00:03:40.040> pager<00:03:40.370> that's<00:03:40.730> a<00:03:41.120> little<00:03:41.329> bit<00:03:41.449> different

00:04:12.369 --> 00:04:12.379 
feeling at first so I will make the

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:15.849 
feeling at first so I will make the
client<00:04:12.620> hold<00:04:12.979> the<00:04:13.099> collar<00:04:13.310> and<00:04:14.199> and<00:04:15.199> start<00:04:15.709> to

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:15.859 
client hold the collar and and start to

00:04:15.859 --> 00:04:17.409 
client hold the collar and and start to
start<00:04:16.099> to<00:04:16.250> turn<00:04:16.400> up<00:04:16.639> the<00:04:16.880> the<00:04:17.120> level<00:04:17.359> of

00:04:17.409 --> 00:04:17.419 
start to turn up the the level of

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:18.969 
start to turn up the the level of
intensity<00:04:17.780> until<00:04:18.109> I<00:04:18.199> know<00:04:18.349> that<00:04:18.530> they<00:04:18.799> can

00:04:18.969 --> 00:04:18.979 
intensity until I know that they can

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:20.800 
intensity until I know that they can
feel<00:04:19.190> it<00:04:19.400> or<00:04:19.489> if<00:04:19.549> it's<00:04:19.669> until<00:04:20.120> they<00:04:20.269> tell<00:04:20.750> me

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:20.810 
feel it or if it's until they tell me

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:22.870 
feel it or if it's until they tell me
that<00:04:20.989> they<00:04:21.139> can<00:04:21.320> feel<00:04:21.530> it<00:04:21.680> and<00:04:21.859> so<00:04:22.310> we<00:04:22.520> use<00:04:22.699> try

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:22.880 
that they can feel it and so we use try

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:26.890 
that they can feel it and so we use try
Tronics<00:04:23.360> for<00:04:23.539> years<00:04:23.930> and<00:04:24.909> usually<00:04:25.909> with<00:04:26.750> the
