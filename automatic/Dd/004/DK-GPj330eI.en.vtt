00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:12.980
 to ensure a long life for the 

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:14.690
 longer battery life 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:16.790
 before first use after long time 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:18.740
 without using a little bit you should leave the 

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:20.779
 charged for 12 hours straight 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:22.849
 for this you will only need in the unit 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:23.689
 source and the source that is pilot 

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:25.340
 automatic 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:26.960
 so you do not have to worry about 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:29.000
 the assembly 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.960
 the source on the side of the 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.020
 theft 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.280
 the connector is just above the switch off 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:38.180
 The key is to stay in position 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:45.980
 eyes off because we connected our 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:48.950
 Direct source on the wall after connecting 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:51.110
 let's upload a video and a central light 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:53.480
 flashing indicating that your face 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:55.210
 is charging when the house is 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.650
 complete this store will remain on 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:59.930
 even with the light on, stay with it 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:02.140
 at least 12 hours connected to the 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:02.140
 electrical 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:10.040
 another important detail before 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:11.689
 to start is that the floor must be free of 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.000
 obstacles for the public with more 

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:16.250
 avoiding efficiencies also give the 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.860
 objects and in choosing theft 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:20.979
 remove wires clothing toys or 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:24.020
 any loose object off the floor 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:25.970
 if you use loose small rugs 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:28.159
 on the floor you should also remove them 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:30.170
 during cleaning to prevent them from being 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:34.100
 drawn with curls in schools 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:35.510
 your robot to avoid damage to theft and 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.840
 ensure that it works efficiently 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:40.940
 you must clean frequently watch 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.010
 simple and complete cleaning and 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:45.440
 see how to keep your other ever new 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:47.720
 we would like you to watch all the 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:51.320
 benefits of this session to take advantage of 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:54.530
 the maximum potential for theft 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:57.229
 When you remove your theft from the box, you 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:02:00.369
 you can see an attention tag that 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:00.369
 is easily removed 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:06.280
 many clients but does not realize that 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:08.440
 there is a protective film on the 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.390
 cover of theft and I believe that your 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.010
 surface is accompanied by a factory 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:14.080
 actually the risks you see in the 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:16.480
 surface of theft are risks in 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.519
 protective film this danger she comes 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.860
 company actually rent a whole 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:23.200
 surface and if you pull by the corner 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:26.620
 Can you see her take it off? 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:28.030
 both the black model and the 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.250
 on the white model 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:32.530
 this well-protected surface with this 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:34.350
 the film and you should remove the 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:38.019
 you can see the acrylic surface 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:39.580
 new that exists in theft 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:41.830
 if you want to keep it for protection 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:43.569
 greater to have any problem of us is 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:44.680
 It is important to note that the 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:47.890
 he does not have stairs 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:49.620
 the risks really are the movie 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:52.299
 protective 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.400
 Another important information is that the 

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:57.819
 theft should not work on flat quotes 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:03:00.160
 such as cement floor or equivalent 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:01.840
 the episode can damage beyond your 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.390
 brushes the rubbers in the area of 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.890
 inspiration 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:08.380
 another important feature to 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:10.000
 highlight is that the optical sensors of the 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:11.590
 theft as any product that 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.630
 works with this type of sensor not 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:16.000
 identify dark furniture and obstacles 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:18.459
 do work from the election of 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.870
 beams of light and to light it is absorbed 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:21.790
 by the dark surface 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:24.519
 for this the robbery against the blacks 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:27.910
 silicone coated sensors 

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:31.180
 silicone that find it a dark way 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:32.739
 in your coalition could stay there and do 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:34.870
 with which he changes direction 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:37.840
 if the property is very fine wire machine 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:39.670
 a minor obstacle theft also has 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:41.670
 a third identification system that 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:44.079
 through the resistance on their wheels 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:45.819
 to find an obstacle other than to 

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:47.889
 identified by the optical sensor 

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:49.930
 mechanical sensor it feels resistance 

00:03:47.889 --> 00:03:52.620
 on its wheels that causes it to change 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:52.620
 position also
