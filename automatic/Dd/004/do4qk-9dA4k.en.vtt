00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:06.810
 there are some things that we learned 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.990
 at school and that we would do well to 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:12.630
 not forget about the role 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.950
 essential insects and more 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.969
 especially insects 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.759
 pollinators 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:20.369
 those same pollinators that carries 

00:00:17.759 --> 00:00:23.579
 pollen from one flower to another flower 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:25.860
 and which thus ensures the reproduction of 

00:00:23.579 --> 00:00:28.770
 plants and somewhere contribute 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:30.599
 directly to our diet 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:32.669
 but it turns out that these pollinators 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.630
 suffer the full force of the use 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.059
 insecticides 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.550
 to the point that in some areas of 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.710
 France these are three colonies of bees 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.350
 out of 4 3 that honeycomb out of four 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:46.410
 that are disappearing and two 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.480
 recent studies show us that the 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.359
 family of the most toxic insecticides 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:54.179
 it's the neonicotinoids that affect 

00:00:51.359 --> 00:00:57.960
 directly the nervous system of 

00:00:54.179 --> 00:01:00.300
 bees and in 2014 a new study 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.179
 scientist show us that the 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:06.090
 most animals are affected by 

00:01:03.179 --> 00:01:09.450
 this insecticide foremost among which 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:12.450
 the human being is most certainly puts 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.780
 endangered brain development 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.990
 children 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:18.590
 you understand the health hazard the 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.640
 environmental danger the nonsense of 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.470
 the use of this family 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.910
 insecticides is the reason for 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:29.070
 which the foundation launches a petition 

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:31.590
 to request a moratorium on 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.870
 the use of neonicotinoids on 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.000
 ask you to support this petition 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:39.210
 we have to carry three ministers 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.600
 concerned the ecology agriculture and the 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.130
 health 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:47.070
 it will allow the French authorities to 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:50.940
 defend a moratorium at European level 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:54.690
 to support this petition 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:57.780
 you go on stop pesticides you fnh 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:02:00.180
 point org a little clip that can be 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.840
 we will avoid taking a big 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.840
 slap thanks
