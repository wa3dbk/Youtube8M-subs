00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
your 32-bit or 64-bit you open it once

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.270 
your 32-bit or 64-bit you open it once
you<00:01:53.610> open<00:01:53.790> it<00:01:53.880> you<00:01:54.420> will<00:01:54.570> get<00:01:54.979> this<00:01:55.979> little

thing in here that says pick your poison

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.350 
thing in here that says pick your poison
so<00:01:57.719> you<00:01:57.810> can<00:01:57.960> make<00:01:58.170> basically<00:01:59.070> this<00:01:59.310> will<00:01:59.549> show

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
so you can make basically this will show

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:01.609 
so you can make basically this will show
you<00:02:00.420> the<00:02:00.659> areas<00:02:00.899> that<00:02:00.990> you<00:02:01.079> can<00:02:01.200> make<00:02:01.380> you<00:02:01.500> can

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
you the areas that you can make you can

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.520 
you the areas that you can make you can
make<00:02:01.649> a<00:02:01.799> hang<00:02:02.399> EIRP<00:02:03.149> like<00:02:03.659> this<00:02:03.810> interrupt<00:02:04.320> in

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
make a hang EIRP like this interrupt in

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.319 
make a hang EIRP like this interrupt in
an<00:02:04.680> interrupt<00:02:05.369> request<00:02:05.520> I<00:02:05.969> believe<00:02:06.149> that's

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
an interrupt request I believe that's

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:10.070 
an interrupt request I believe that's
what<00:02:06.450> IR<00:02:06.719> P<00:02:06.840> stands<00:02:07.049> for<00:02:07.610> and<00:02:08.690> are<00:02:09.690> that<00:02:09.929> maybe

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
what IR P stands for and are that maybe

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.630 
what IR P stands for and are that maybe
it's<00:02:10.229> req<00:02:10.590> LM<00:02:10.800> not<00:02:10.920> sure

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
it's req LM not sure

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.220 
it's req LM not sure
code<00:02:12.090> overwrite<00:02:12.599> stack<00:02:12.989> track

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
code overwrite stack track

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:17.310 
code overwrite stack track
buffer<00:02:14.650> overflow<00:02:15.160> hierarchy<00:02:15.850> orq<00:02:16.390> oh<00:02:16.630> well

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:17.320 
buffer overflow hierarchy orq oh well

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:18.630 
buffer overflow hierarchy orq oh well
these<00:02:17.410> are<00:02:17.560> basically<00:02:17.830> they're<00:02:18.040> just<00:02:18.070> ways<00:02:18.370> to

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
these are basically they're just ways to

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.230 
these are basically they're just ways to
these<00:02:19.480> little<00:02:19.750> bugs<00:02:20.020> and<00:02:20.200> demonstrations<00:02:20.830> to

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
these little bugs and demonstrations to

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.670 
these little bugs and demonstrations to
make<00:02:22.240> the<00:02:22.360> Windows<00:02:22.660> system<00:02:22.960> kind<00:02:23.140> of<00:02:23.200> overflow

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
make the Windows system kind of overflow

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.710 
make the Windows system kind of overflow
and<00:02:24.130> not<00:02:24.340> in<00:02:24.460> bet<00:02:24.640> you<00:02:24.760> know<00:02:24.850> it's<00:02:25.060> a<00:02:25.150> just<00:02:25.630> a

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
and not in bet you know it's a just a

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.810 
and not in bet you know it's a just a
bug<00:02:26.110> tool<00:02:26.470> and<00:02:26.800> it<00:02:27.130> will<00:02:27.280> make<00:02:27.430> your<00:02:27.550> computer

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:27.820 
bug tool and it will make your computer

because<00:03:01.450> you<00:03:01.630> know<00:03:01.750> just<00:03:01.900> one<00:03:01.990> of<00:03:02.080> those

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140 
because you know just one of those

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:03.330 
because you know just one of those
things<00:03:02.350> if<00:03:02.500> your<00:03:02.680> windows<00:03:02.920> here<00:03:03.040> you<00:03:03.160> probably

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
things if your windows here you probably

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:04.920 
things if your windows here you probably
see<00:03:03.550> its<00:03:03.670> long<00:03:03.880> people<00:03:04.180> get<00:03:04.360> tired<00:03:04.570> of<00:03:04.720> it<00:03:04.840> and

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
see its long people get tired of it and

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:06.570 
see its long people get tired of it and
you<00:03:05.440> know<00:03:05.530> now<00:03:05.650> people<00:03:05.709> are<00:03:06.010> making<00:03:06.310> out<00:03:06.430> or

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:06.580 
you know now people are making out or

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:09.300 
you know now people are making out or
you<00:03:06.730> should<00:03:07.000> change<00:03:07.209> the<00:03:07.390> color<00:03:07.750> of<00:03:08.140> the<00:03:08.709> B<00:03:09.130> saw

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
you should change the color of the B saw

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:11.790 
you should change the color of the B saw
so<00:03:09.520> this<00:03:09.640> F<00:03:09.850> G<00:03:10.120> stands<00:03:10.360> for<00:03:10.420> foreground<00:03:10.959> B<00:03:11.590> G

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:11.800 
so this F G stands for foreground B G

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.440 
so this F G stands for foreground B G
stands<00:03:12.040> for<00:03:12.160> background<00:03:12.280> so<00:03:12.940> you<00:03:12.970> can<00:03:13.209> change

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.450 
stands for background so you can change

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:15.600 
stands for background so you can change
both<00:03:14.140> colors<00:03:14.560> you<00:03:14.680> know<00:03:14.770> like<00:03:14.920> the<00:03:15.010> text<00:03:15.430> and

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:15.610 
both colors you know like the text and

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:18.300 
both colors you know like the text and
the<00:03:16.030> actual<00:03:16.690> blue<00:03:17.020> you<00:03:17.440> get<00:03:17.620> usually<00:03:17.980> two<00:03:18.100> blue

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
the actual blue you get usually two blue

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:21.120 
the actual blue you get usually two blue
on<00:03:18.489> white<00:03:18.810> white<00:03:19.810> on<00:03:19.840> yeah<00:03:20.260> blue<00:03:20.830> on<00:03:20.950> white

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.130 
on white white on yeah blue on white

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:23.490 
on white white on yeah blue on white
blue<00:03:21.489> back<00:03:21.670> on<00:03:21.850> on<00:03:22.000> white<00:03:22.150> text<00:03:22.510> and<00:03:23.290> you<00:03:23.380> can

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
blue back on on white text and you can

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:25.170 
blue back on on white text and you can
change<00:03:23.709> out<00:03:23.860> to<00:03:24.070> whatever<00:03:24.280> you<00:03:24.550> you<00:03:24.910> know<00:03:25.030> your

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180 
change out to whatever you you know your

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:28.590 
change out to whatever you you know your
heart's<00:03:25.390> content<00:03:25.510> and<00:03:26.940> leak<00:03:27.940> pool<00:03:28.239> leaked

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:28.600 
heart's content and leak pool leaked

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:30.570 
heart's content and leak pool leaked
freed<00:03:29.140> on<00:03:29.320> exits<00:03:29.709> I'm<00:03:29.830> not<00:03:30.010> sure<00:03:30.130> this<00:03:30.310> is<00:03:30.459> I'm

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:30.580 
freed on exits I'm not sure this is I'm

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:33.060 
freed on exits I'm not sure this is I'm
guessing<00:03:30.910> this<00:03:31.180> is<00:03:31.360> just<00:03:31.769> something<00:03:32.769> to<00:03:32.950> do

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:33.070 
guessing this is just something to do

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:35.100 
guessing this is just something to do
with<00:03:33.190> the<00:03:33.340> arena's<00:03:33.850> article<00:03:34.269> but<00:03:34.810> basically

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:35.110 
with the arena's article but basically

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
with the arena's article but basically
these<00:03:35.230> are<00:03:35.290> the<00:03:35.380> main<00:03:35.530> things<00:03:35.769> you<00:03:35.860> can<00:03:36.010> do<00:03:36.100> a

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:36.130 
these are the main things you can do a

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:37.830 
these are the main things you can do a
hang<00:03:36.430> a<00:03:36.700> deadlock<00:03:37.030> so<00:03:37.209> I<00:03:37.239> hang<00:03:37.450> I'm<00:03:37.570> guessing

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
hang a deadlock so I hang I'm guessing

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.600 
hang a deadlock so I hang I'm guessing
would<00:03:37.930> just<00:03:38.050> be<00:03:38.110> like<00:03:38.230> a<00:03:38.290> but<00:03:39.220> you<00:03:39.340> know<00:03:39.430> one<00:03:39.580> of

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:39.610 
would just be like a but you know one of

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:40.920 
would just be like a but you know one of
those<00:03:39.760> freeze<00:03:40.030> ups<00:03:40.269> and<00:03:40.540> then<00:03:40.660> you<00:03:40.750> look<00:03:40.840> at

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:40.930 
those freeze ups and then you look at

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:42.690 
those freeze ups and then you look at
the<00:03:41.019> air<00:03:41.140> and<00:03:41.410> then<00:03:41.560> you'll<00:03:42.070> probably<00:03:42.340> have<00:03:42.610> to

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:42.700 
the air and then you'll probably have to

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.390 
the air and then you'll probably have to
do<00:03:42.850> a<00:03:42.880> restart<00:03:43.180> but<00:03:43.870> I'm<00:03:44.019> opening<00:03:44.739> back<00:03:45.190> the

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:45.400 
do a restart but I'm opening back the

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.490 
do a restart but I'm opening back the
article<00:03:45.790> here<00:03:45.940> you<00:03:46.060> can<00:03:46.180> see<00:03:46.420> what<00:03:47.200> some<00:03:47.230> of

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.500 
article here you can see what some of

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:48.750 
article here you can see what some of
the<00:03:47.560> things<00:03:47.769> look<00:03:47.980> like<00:03:48.010> here<00:03:48.340> him<00:03:48.489> look<00:03:48.640> they

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
the things look like here him look they

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.520 
the things look like here him look they
look<00:03:48.880> pretty<00:03:49.060> funny<00:03:49.239> here<00:03:49.450> so<00:03:49.570> for<00:03:50.200> example

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:50.530 
look pretty funny here so for example

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:52.110 
look pretty funny here so for example
here's<00:03:50.680> a<00:03:50.739> blue<00:03:50.920> screen<00:03:51.130> from<00:03:51.700> the<00:03:51.730> above

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120 
here's a blue screen from the above

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.630 
here's a blue screen from the above
color<00:03:52.420> choice<00:03:52.660> that<00:03:52.840> he<00:03:52.930> said<00:03:53.170> in<00:03:53.350> here<00:03:53.709> and<00:03:53.890> as

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:54.640 
color choice that he said in here and as

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:56.880 
color choice that he said in here and as
you<00:03:54.730> can<00:03:54.850> see<00:03:55.030> it<00:03:55.360> is<00:03:55.600> there's<00:03:56.350> a<00:03:56.410> problem<00:03:56.709> has

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:56.890 
you can see it is there's a problem has

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:58.020 
you can see it is there's a problem has
been<00:03:57.010> tected<00:03:57.370> and<00:03:57.489> when<00:03:57.610> there<00:03:57.700> was<00:03:57.790> a<00:03:57.820> shut

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.030 
been tected and when there was a shut

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:59.570 
been tected and when there was a shut
down<00:03:58.150> to<00:03:58.299> prevent<00:03:58.450> damage<00:03:58.630> to<00:03:58.959> your<00:03:59.049> computer

00:03:59.570 --> 00:03:59.580 
down to prevent damage to your computer

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:02.039 
down to prevent damage to your computer
so<00:04:00.580> you<00:04:00.610> know<00:04:00.760> nothing's<00:04:01.060> really<00:04:01.239> gonna<00:04:01.570> screw

so you know nothing's really gonna screw
up<00:04:02.140> on<00:04:02.260> your<00:04:02.290> machine<00:04:02.830> obviously<00:04:02.980> you<00:04:03.220> want<00:04:03.340> to

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:03.400

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:04.680 
up on your machine obviously you want to
save<00:04:03.549> all<00:04:03.730> your<00:04:03.850> data<00:04:04.060> and<00:04:04.269> it's<00:04:04.360> really<00:04:04.600> as

easy as that you don't need to tweak

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.490 
easy as that you don't need to tweak
anything<00:04:06.730> you<00:04:07.630> know<00:04:07.750> other<00:04:07.989> than<00:04:08.140> that<00:04:08.200> that

is<00:04:26.199> an<00:04:26.320> interesting<00:04:26.500> thing<00:04:26.889> here<00:04:27.100> if<00:04:27.190> you
