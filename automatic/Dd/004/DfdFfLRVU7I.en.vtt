take care when you fold your Chemex

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:18.370 
take care when you fold your Chemex
paper<00:01:16.030> some<00:01:17.030> papers<00:01:17.450> can<00:01:17.630> be<00:01:17.780> folded<00:01:17.990> but<00:01:18.259> if

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:18.380 
paper some papers can be folded but if

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.099 
paper some papers can be folded but if
yours<00:01:18.590> isn't<00:01:18.829> fold<00:01:19.759> in<00:01:19.939> half<00:01:20.119> and<00:01:20.420> then<00:01:20.929> half

yours isn't fold in half and then half

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:26.520 
yours isn't fold in half and then half
again<00:01:21.289> so<00:01:21.740> it<00:01:22.100> forms<00:01:22.310> a<00:01:22.429> cone<00:01:22.609> shape

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.100 
spout of the Chemex then add hot water
this<00:01:36.040> will<00:01:36.250> heat<00:01:36.400> up<00:01:36.580> the<00:01:36.790> Chemex<00:01:37.090> and<00:01:37.450> also

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:38.110 
this will heat up the Chemex and also

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:40.620 
this will heat up the Chemex and also
remove<00:01:38.440> any<00:01:38.680> paper<00:01:39.009> e-text<00:01:39.790> we<00:01:40.150> want<00:01:40.330> to<00:01:40.479> make
