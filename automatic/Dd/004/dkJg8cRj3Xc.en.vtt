these<00:01:08.729> is<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:09.330> fact<00:01:09.570> that<00:01:09.659> it's<00:01:09.840> actually<00:01:10.229> two

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
these is the fact that it's actually two

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.590 
these is the fact that it's actually two
layers<00:01:10.890> and<00:01:11.189> they<00:01:11.610> have<00:01:11.760> a<00:01:11.790> laser<00:01:12.119> etch<00:01:12.360> design

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
layers and they have a laser etch design

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.649 
layers and they have a laser etch design
on<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.170> top<00:01:13.430> the<00:01:14.430> first<00:01:14.670> layer<00:01:14.909> is<00:01:14.939> this<00:01:15.270> clear

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
on the top the first layer is this clear

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.230 
on the top the first layer is this clear
red<00:01:15.930> interior<00:01:16.759> then<00:01:17.759> they<00:01:17.880> put<00:01:18.060> on<00:01:18.150> the

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
red interior then they put on the

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.660 
red interior then they put on the
metallic<00:01:18.750> finish<00:01:19.049> back<00:01:19.350> then<00:01:19.950> finally<00:01:20.430> the

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
metallic finish back then finally the

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.760 
metallic finish back then finally the
laser<00:01:20.970> etch<00:01:21.270> through<00:01:21.689> the<00:01:21.810> metallic<00:01:22.290> overlay

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
laser etch through the metallic overlay

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.830 
laser etch through the metallic overlay
so<00:01:23.310> the<00:01:23.400> design<00:01:23.549> you<00:01:23.850> can<00:01:24.000> see<00:01:24.210> is<00:01:24.420> actually

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
so the design you can see is actually

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.749 
so the design you can see is actually
just<00:01:24.960> a<00:01:25.140> clear<00:01:25.409> red<00:01:25.680> interior<00:01:26.280> showing

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
just a clear red interior showing

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.550 
just a clear red interior showing
through<00:01:27.030> and<00:01:27.270> it<00:01:27.630> just<00:01:27.659> looks<00:01:27.990> amazing<00:01:28.110> when

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
through and it just looks amazing when

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.010 
through and it just looks amazing when
it's<00:01:28.680> actually<00:01:28.860> put<00:01:29.189> on<00:01:29.369> the<00:01:29.520> phone<00:01:29.810> the<00:01:30.810> back

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
it's actually put on the phone the back

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.840 
it's actually put on the phone the back
is<00:01:31.170> a<00:01:31.200> nice<00:01:31.439> glossy<00:01:31.680> reflective<00:01:32.369> plastic

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
is a nice glossy reflective plastic

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.429 
is a nice glossy reflective plastic
which<00:01:33.119> is<00:01:33.150> why<00:01:33.270> these<00:01:33.450> cases<00:01:33.960> belong<00:01:34.259> to

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
which is why these cases belong to

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.340 
which is why these cases belong to
metallic<00:01:35.220> series<00:01:35.549> and<00:01:36.150> the<00:01:36.479> interior<00:01:36.840> like<00:01:37.229> I

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
metallic series and the interior like I

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459 
like most snap on back cover cases but

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:22.430 
like most snap on back cover cases but
the<00:02:20.550> sides<00:02:20.849> are<00:02:21.060> actually<00:02:21.480> fully<00:02:21.810> covered<00:02:22.260> and

but for more most back cover cases

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.410 
but for more most back cover cases
they're<00:03:20.010> mainly<00:03:20.220> useful<00:03:20.670> for<00:03:20.880> scratch<00:03:21.150> and

they're mainly useful for scratch and

they're mainly useful for scratch and

minor drops or nothing more however for
these<00:03:26.430> particular<00:03:26.670> cases<00:03:27.000> I'd<00:03:27.840> say<00:03:28.109> they'd<00:03:28.260> be

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380 
these particular cases I'd say they'd be

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:30.319 
these particular cases I'd say they'd be
great<00:03:28.650> for<00:03:28.920> more<00:03:29.070> special<00:03:29.579> occasions<00:03:30.060> such<00:03:30.209> as

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:30.329 
great for more special occasions such as

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:32.539 
great for more special occasions such as
weddings<00:03:30.450> or<00:03:31.049> fancy<00:03:31.470> dinners<00:03:31.829> and<00:03:32.070> banquets

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:32.549 
weddings or fancy dinners and banquets

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:34.490 
weddings or fancy dinners and banquets
and<00:03:32.760> all<00:03:32.850> that<00:03:33.060> just<00:03:33.660> because<00:03:33.930> of<00:03:34.049> the<00:03:34.079> elegant

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
and all that just because of the elegant

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.530 
and all that just because of the elegant
look<00:03:34.890> of<00:03:35.010> them<00:03:35.130> not<00:03:35.700> saying<00:03:36.000> you<00:03:36.090> can't<00:03:36.120> use

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
look of them not saying you can't use

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.479 
look of them not saying you can't use
these<00:03:36.720> on<00:03:36.870> a<00:03:36.900> regular<00:03:37.140> basis<00:03:37.739> but<00:03:38.220> for<00:03:38.400> the

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:38.489 
these on a regular basis but for the

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:40.310 
these on a regular basis but for the
looks<00:03:38.730> I<00:03:38.940> think<00:03:39.390> they'd<00:03:39.480> be<00:03:39.630> more<00:03:39.660> appropriate

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:40.320 
looks I think they'd be more appropriate

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.770 
looks I think they'd be more appropriate
for<00:03:40.350> those<00:03:40.620> types<00:03:40.890> of<00:03:40.980> situations<00:03:41.570> to<00:03:42.570> take

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
for those types of situations to take

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:44.810 
for those types of situations to take
off<00:03:42.930> the<00:03:43.079> case<00:03:43.290> very<00:03:43.769> simply<00:03:44.160> pull<00:03:44.670> off<00:03:44.790> a

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:44.820 
off the case very simply pull off a

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:48.430 
off the case very simply pull off a
corner<00:03:45.890> like<00:03:46.890> that<00:03:47.160> and<00:03:47.400> you're<00:03:48.000> good<00:03:48.180> to<00:03:48.209> go

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:48.440

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:56.579 
like put that one aside same process to

00:03:56.579 --> 00:03:59.750 
like put that one aside same process to
install<00:03:57.030> the<00:03:57.150> case<00:03:57.620> on<00:03:58.620> the<00:03:59.220> back<00:03:59.430> you<00:03:59.609> can<00:03:59.670> see
