00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:13.679
 versatile and affordable lg monitor 

00:00:10.499 --> 00:00:15.329
 23rd p60 sunflower seeds u belongs to the new 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.520
 line of company sales devices 

00:00:15.329 --> 00:00:19.590
 which began in 2015 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.110
 like most of them this monitor 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.550
 built on the basis of ips matrix outwardly he 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:25.500
 completely corresponds to the price 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.630
 categories in our case it is simple 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.160
 stand and already known frameless 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.870
 design that we have seen before 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.879
 the whole body is glossy its thickness 

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:34.920
 small but back downwards 

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:36.300
 because of the interface of the new block stand 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.079
 allows you to only change the angle of inclination 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.420
 panels 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.070
 the frame on the sides of the matrix of course there is 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.350
 but a little more interest 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.600
 causes a plastic border around between 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.249
 there is a small gap in the matrix 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.699
 will be able to carefully collect all the dust 

00:00:47.249 --> 00:00:52.409
 which you try to erase monitors 

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:54.690
 according to a clever notation and 

00:00:52.409 --> 00:00:56.670
 points and means a modification in which 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.170
 besides the standard for the series de garden 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.420
 there is also hdmi 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.190
 they are special niches there 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.290
 there is also a headphone output for output 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.299
 sound coming through hdmi 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.729
 dynamics on the monitor do not have that on her 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.530
 to a large extent and do not need it is time 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.479
 say goodbye to a bunch of buttons in the lodge 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.490
 switched to management using convenient 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.530
 joystick reworked menu 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.960
 she became intuitive one click 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.090
 quick navigation shift is activated 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.070
 left opens the full menu among 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.770
 unexpected color setting function with 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.689
 using a weak green or red 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:29.759
 for lovers of classic solutions there is 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:32.159
 and the usual adjustment is three or six 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.539
 colors are also familiar modes for 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.799
 read only two of them 

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:36.479
 they decrease the contrast 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:39.479
 stop the warmer color 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:41.670
 gamma factory settings were not 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.590
 as accurate as I would like to picture 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.500
 looks like cold measurements showed 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.719
 more than 8,000 kelvin gamma exactly and in 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.030
 area 18 so I had to rummage in 

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:52.560
 parameters after changing the gamma mode to 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.329
 zero and low switching 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.939
 black managed to get decent 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:58.979
 gamma performance does not go beyond 2 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:01.670
 1 2 and 3 and the temperature remained 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.409
 cold 7 208 thousand kelins 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.240
 principle can be brought to the ideal with 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:07.009
 using fine color adjustment 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.780
 increasing the level of red but it can 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:11.030
 do only with measuring 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:13.130
 devices from the nice features of this 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.840
 monitor lines no flicker 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:17.270
 highlighting as evidenced by the inscription 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.340
 flicker safe also owner 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:21.290
 gets some more interesting utilities 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.750
 for additional functions division 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.850
 screen into four pieces bringing to 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.739
 identical color rendition of two monitors 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:30.769
 using the color cloning program and 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:33.110
 There are no smartphones 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:35.569
 claims as speed measured 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:35.989
 panel contrast was 580 k 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:39.350
 to one 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:41.840
 and the brightness is at least forty-three at most 162 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:44.390
 kandava per square meter range not 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.650
 very big yes and for dark and 43 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:48.380
 the shackles are a bit too much 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:50.420
 23 inches quite suitable diagonal 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:52.850
 home monitor and with limited 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:55.130
 budget generally ideally add here 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:55.790
 fast matrix and ps excellent angles 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:59.860
 review 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:59.860
 good design and easy control
