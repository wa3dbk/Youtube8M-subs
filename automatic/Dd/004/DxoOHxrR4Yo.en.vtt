00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:11.880
 system load 

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:14.990
 after having emptied in the 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:17.119
 system we are able to charge 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:19.220
 how are we going to work with refrigerants 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:20.320
 and pressure elements we must remember 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:23.270
 use security elements 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:25.130
 Suitable as goggles and gloves in 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:26.840
 reference to the refrigerant charge in 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:28.490
 the refrigerator system must be read 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.140
 carefully the label of the 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:32.300
 systems to know what is the 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:33.880
 indicated refrigerant and the amount of 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:36.220
 Load required 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:38.500
 as the r12 increasingly difficult to 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:40.780
 find and its price starts to be more 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.460
 elevated that other options we attach 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.470
 here a table of refrigerants 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:47.200
 alternative that can be useful 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:49.600
 to perform retrofit in different 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:52.090
 products should be taken into account 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.890
 that insufficient loads cause loss 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:55.860
 of performance and waste of energy 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:58.320
 electric 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.600
 the excess load causes pressure 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.790
 high discharge with the increase in 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.830
 pressures increases the effort of the motor 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:07.230
 that gets hotter and increases the 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.460
 temperature of the compressed fluid with the 

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:10.530
 elevation of the temperatures of 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.030
 compressor the lubricating oil can 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.640
 carbonize in the hottest spots 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:17.370
 which are the suction valves and let 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.140
 the deposit of this carbonization does not 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:20.970
 allows the correct operation of 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.250
 the valves causing loss of 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.950
 compression and therefore efficiency 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.020
 of the compressor after reviewing all 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.090
 these calamities caused by charges 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.190
 wrong of the system we should be 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.380
 aware of the enormous importance that 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:36.380
 has the loading in the most accurate way 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.270
 possible 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.610
 It is also important not to 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.079
 partial refills without first detecting 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:44.450
 the leaks and repair them 

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:46.430
 the partial recharge does not solve the 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.909
 basic problem that is the leak of the 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:50.069
 refrigerant 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:52.530
 the flight makes the short time the 

00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:53.749
 system fails again and we are also 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.560
 allowing him to keep escaping 

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:59.689
 refrigerant to the environment 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:02.119
 and various metering instruments and 

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:04.009
 load cylinders can be used 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:06.470
 graduates and load balances 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:08.570
 automatic or manual 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:10.310
 in the services area it is usual 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:12.920
 perform the load controlling the pressure 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:15.200
 of the circuit with the mali fold playing the 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.480
 return pipe or measuring consumption 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.940
 of the compressor using an amper clamp 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.280
 or metric 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:23.320
 Be careful when loading by return or 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.120
 by pressure the letters can be 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:27.760
 imprecise because they vary with the 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.500
 room temperature small errors in 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.930
 the loads in refrigeration circuits 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:34.660
 small ones cause great problems of 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:36.520
 therefore operating in the area 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:38.560
 service load cylinders 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:40.390
 graduates and the scales are the 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:43.640
 most known elements because they are 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:46.790
 portable and very simple operation 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:48.890
 we will now see a graduated cylinder this 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:50.990
 equipment has a glass column a 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:53.209
 graduated cylinder and a pressure gauge 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:54.770
 pressure is an element that is being 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:58.130
 ceasing to use for the following 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:03:00.020
 causes is a volumetric method with what 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:02.320
 which always must be compensated 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:05.300
 Coolant pressure before charging 

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:07.370
 in small loads we can produce a 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:10.010
 important parallax error in the 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:11.930
 reading the letter you need a 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:13.819
 graduated cylinder for each type of 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:15.739
 refrigerant to charge not to leave 

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:18.530
 remains within the cylinder 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:20.570
 different types of refrigerants is by 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:23.120
 that the most recommended method for its 

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:25.700
 accuracy and ease of operation without 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:27.739
 errors is the load by scale the 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:29.870
 Most are programmable and easy to 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:32.209
 operate you just have to take into account the 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:34.310
 degree of accuracy the same as 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:36.739
 there are scales in the market with 10 grams 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:39.060
 of accuracy that are used to load air 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:41.340
 conditioning but not refrigerators 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:42.690
 a valid accuracy to perform 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:44.640
 any loading operation in 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:46.220
 refrigerators should be in the order of 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:48.710
 the two grams 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:50.420
 the scale in addition to carrying more 

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:52.580
 precision allows you to load any 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:55.130
 refrigerant because you only have to 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:57.410
 change tank and hose there 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:59.270
 manual and automatic scales 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:01.400
 The latter have a solenoid valve 

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:04.790
 which closes automatically once 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:07.189
 reached the programmed charge value 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:08.569
 Finally remember that whenever 

00:04:07.189 --> 00:04:10.969
 load a product in liquid phase 

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:12.790
 must load on the high side of the 

00:04:10.969 --> 00:04:15.260
 equipment and with the equipment turned off 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:17.419
 -never charge in liquid phase by the 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:19.100
 low side because it could destroy the 

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:21.769
 compressor if it is found 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:24.320
 connected whenever you have to charge 

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:26.570
 gas phase refrigerant do it for 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:29.539
 the low side can help the load 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:31.310
 keep the compressor connected remember 

00:04:29.539 --> 00:04:33.530
 than in the disposable bottles with the 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:35.690
 claw was inverted down loaded 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:38.169
 the liquid and with the carafe stopped 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:38.169
 gas charge
