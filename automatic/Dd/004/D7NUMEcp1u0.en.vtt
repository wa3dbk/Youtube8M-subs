 in the channel regarding this game I know that 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.199
 most of you expect that 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.539
 continue with the series we had 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.850
 active until two weeks ago in fact 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.470
 very quickly, I recommend you to see 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.240
 the last video for those people 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.279
 that they did not see it for those people 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.500
 they still do not know what happened 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.690
 with the channel the last two weeks the 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.190

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.899
 good guys from yesterday take back 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.870

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.730
 blog explaining what happened 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.230
 problems that I had with youtube and others and 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.510

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.800

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:16.680
 happened guys the liquid for 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:18.329
 barbecue is for the centurion wow al 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:20.579
 impregnate each of the pieces of 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:22.380
 coal in the liquid for barbecues and 

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:24.210
 they get hotter shots and more 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:26.610
 damage guys I think it's the last 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:28.290
 skill that I needed for what 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:30.030
 was the centurion so you have to bring 

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:33.030
 a like with this character yes that what 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:35.850
 fancy the consumable what is a 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:37.980
 man a zombie dancer we have here 

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:40.440
 stronger bars for the carnival thing 

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:42.510
 move faster with bars 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:45.240
 stronger retry by team 

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:47.190
 old set of customization 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:49.440
 Facial hair, part number 2 and 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:51.330
 we finished with the day set of 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:52.530
 beach is a tattoo for carnivores 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:54.810
 so guys 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:56.310
 remember for those people ojito 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:59.100
 this will only serve the 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:00.720
 people who maybe did not play on the flat 

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:03.530
 against zombies while these were 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:06.090
 envelopes and obviously I want it 

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:07.950
 blame him here I already have the 

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:09.960
 most of the halloween pieces the 

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:11.580
 Most pieces of Christmas I want 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:13.500
 think that because of it, it is that 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:15.889
 there are pieces that come out to me and that's why 

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:17.810
 that the game only gave me cigars with 

00:05:15.889 --> 00:05:19.520
 but ojito if you do not have any of these 

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:21.499
 pieces you did not buy envelopes when 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:22.939
 were you or did you have the game? 

00:05:21.499 --> 00:05:24.740
 I recommend that you buy them because to you 

00:05:22.939 --> 00:05:27.830
 you will get good things not to the 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:29.870
 contrary to me that maybe I already have the 

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:32.419
 most of these pieces because the 

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:34.759
 obviously there's no need to hiccup 

00:05:32.419 --> 00:05:36.349
 I estimate that they are repeated so that nothing 

00:05:34.759 --> 00:05:38.900
 guys what is said is plants against 

00:05:36.349 --> 00:05:40.370
 zombies is back I will take the biggest 

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:42.590
 part of the series that we have in the 

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:44.060
 channel if they have new ideas if they want 

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:46.009
 some character if they want some 

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:48.349
 departure if they want me to please any 

00:05:46.009 --> 00:05:49.699
 idea something they would like to see not 

00:05:48.349 --> 00:05:51.590
 forget they left the comments and 

00:05:49.699 --> 00:05:53.150
 At that moment I say goodbye to many more 

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:54.860
