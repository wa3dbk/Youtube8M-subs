hello<00:00:12.130> everybody<00:00:12.610> and<00:00:12.940> welcome<00:00:13.090> back<00:00:13.389> to

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:13.570 
hello everybody and welcome back to

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:15.810 
hello everybody and welcome back to
minecraft<00:00:13.990> will<00:00:14.590> where<00:00:14.920> we<00:00:15.100> will<00:00:15.250> be<00:00:15.309> taking<00:00:15.580> a

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:15.820 
minecraft will where we will be taking a

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:18.660 
minecraft will where we will be taking a
look<00:00:16.000> at<00:00:16.180> nuclear<00:00:16.600> power<00:00:17.039> so<00:00:18.039> this<00:00:18.520> is<00:00:18.640> a

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:18.670 
look at nuclear power so this is a

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:20.850 
look at nuclear power so this is a
teleporter<00:00:19.300> and<00:00:19.330> you<00:00:19.480> can<00:00:19.630> power<00:00:20.290> things<00:00:20.650> like

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:20.860 
teleporter and you can power things like

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:23.970 
teleporter and you can power things like
this<00:00:21.009> with<00:00:21.250> nuclear<00:00:21.670> power<00:00:21.880> as<00:00:22.680> you<00:00:23.680> can<00:00:23.800> see<00:00:23.950> i

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:23.980 
this with nuclear power as you can see i

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:25.859 
this with nuclear power as you can see i
also<00:00:24.220> have<00:00:24.400> my<00:00:24.460> solar<00:00:24.759> panel<00:00:25.180> over<00:00:25.419> there<00:00:25.450> but

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:25.869 
also have my solar panel over there but

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:30.089 
also have my solar panel over there but
here<00:00:26.710> is<00:00:26.890> my<00:00:27.130> facility<00:00:27.939> where<00:00:28.269> I<00:00:28.300> have<00:00:28.600> in<00:00:29.410> this

00:00:30.089 --> 00:00:30.099 
here is my facility where I have in this

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:34.380 
here is my facility where I have in this
room<00:00:30.460> for<00:00:30.970> nuclear<00:00:31.720> chambers<00:00:32.349> and<00:00:33.390> they're

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:34.390 
room for nuclear chambers and they're

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:40.110 
room for nuclear chambers and they're
quite<00:00:34.800> quite<00:00:35.800> powerful<00:00:36.449> I<00:00:37.449> have<00:00:37.900> I<00:00:38.320> believe<00:00:39.309> 16

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:40.120 
quite quite powerful I have I believe 16

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:44.000 
quite quite powerful I have I believe 16
uranium<00:00:40.750> in<00:00:40.900> each<00:00:41.489> reactor<00:00:42.489> this<00:00:43.180> is<00:00:43.329> a<00:00:43.360> very

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
uranium in each reactor this is a very

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.040 
uranium in each reactor this is a very
efficient<00:00:45.010> setup<00:00:45.219> but<00:00:45.670> I'll<00:00:45.790> stand<00:00:46.149> it<00:00:46.420> has<00:00:47.020> a

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:47.050 
efficient setup but I'll stand it has a

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:49.080 
efficient setup but I'll stand it has a
lot<00:00:47.290> of<00:00:47.320> electricity<00:00:48.129> but<00:00:48.550> also<00:00:48.670> a<00:00:48.820> lot<00:00:48.940> of

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:49.090 
lot of electricity but also a lot of

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:52.650 
lot of electricity but also a lot of
heat<00:00:49.270> and<00:00:49.450> whatnot<00:00:50.700> so<00:00:51.700> there's<00:00:51.910> that<00:00:52.000> one<00:00:52.360> too

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:52.660 
heat and whatnot so there's that one too

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:55.290 
heat and whatnot so there's that one too
now<00:00:53.620> you<00:00:53.680> might<00:00:54.190> be<00:00:54.340> asking<00:00:54.370> how<00:00:55.000> am<00:00:55.149> I<00:00:55.180> going

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:55.300 
now you might be asking how am I going

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.299 
now you might be asking how am I going
to<00:00:55.360> wire<00:00:55.539> this<00:00:55.809> well<00:00:56.199> I<00:00:56.230> have<00:00:56.770> all<00:00:56.980> the<00:00:57.100> wiring

00:00:57.299 --> 00:00:57.309 
to wire this well I have all the wiring

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:00.180 
to wire this well I have all the wiring
leading<00:00:57.940> into<00:00:58.210> a<00:00:58.239> high-voltage<00:00:58.539> I<00:00:59.320> believe

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:00.190 
leading into a high-voltage I believe

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:05.279 
leading into a high-voltage I believe
MSF<00:01:01.180> you<00:01:02.280> MF<00:01:03.280> s<00:01:03.460> you<00:01:03.640> and<00:01:03.989> you<00:01:04.989> can<00:01:05.110> see<00:01:05.259> the

00:01:05.279 --> 00:01:05.289 
MSF you MF s you and you can see the

00:01:05.289 --> 00:01:07.290 
MSF you MF s you and you can see the
power<00:01:05.500> is<00:01:05.649> going<00:01:05.770> up<00:01:05.979> a<00:01:06.070> lot<00:01:06.280> but<00:01:06.580> also<00:01:06.759> powers

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:07.300 
power is going up a lot but also powers

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.300 
power is going up a lot but also powers
coming<00:01:07.690> out<00:01:07.899> of<00:01:07.930> it<00:01:08.170> so<00:01:08.440> but<00:01:08.710> this<00:01:08.860> one<00:01:09.070> hasn't

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:09.310 
coming out of it so but this one hasn't

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:12.600 
coming out of it so but this one hasn't
hasn't<00:01:10.090> quite<00:01:10.450> heated<00:01:10.720> up<00:01:10.960> yet<00:01:11.170> so<00:01:11.979> we'll<00:01:12.490> go

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:12.610 
hasn't quite heated up yet so we'll go

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:14.669 
hasn't quite heated up yet so we'll go
see<00:01:12.789> what<00:01:12.970> we<00:01:13.060> can<00:01:13.180> do<00:01:13.300> with<00:01:13.420> this<00:01:13.479> well<00:01:13.840> over

00:01:14.669 --> 00:01:14.679 
see what we can do with this well over

00:01:14.679 --> 00:01:17.100 
see what we can do with this well over
here<00:01:14.860> we<00:01:15.039> have<00:01:15.220> a<00:01:15.250> mass<00:01:15.610> fabricator<00:01:16.030> where<00:01:16.959> you

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:17.110 
here we have a mass fabricator where you

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:20.040 
here we have a mass fabricator where you
can<00:01:17.289> create<00:01:17.590> matter<00:01:18.039> and<00:01:18.369> make<00:01:18.819> cool<00:01:19.780> suits

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:20.050 
can create matter and make cool suits

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:23.430 
can create matter and make cool suits
and<00:01:20.289> whatnot<00:01:20.670> but<00:01:21.670> over<00:01:22.300> here<00:01:22.539> i<00:01:22.569> put<00:01:23.080> the

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:23.440 
and whatnot but over here i put the

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.710 
and whatnot but over here i put the
current<00:01:23.800> into<00:01:24.130> a<00:01:24.160> couple<00:01:24.700> of<00:01:24.759> transformers<00:01:25.479> to

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:25.720 
current into a couple of transformers to

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.770 
current into a couple of transformers to
make<00:01:25.869> them<00:01:26.050> low<00:01:26.440> current<00:01:27.030> low<00:01:28.030> voltage<00:01:28.450> I'm

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:28.780 
make them low current low voltage I'm

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:31.740 
make them low current low voltage I'm
bad<00:01:29.110> and<00:01:29.319> you<00:01:29.429> can<00:01:30.429> power<00:01:30.640> a<00:01:30.729> bunch<00:01:31.030> of<00:01:31.209> little

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:31.750 
bad and you can power a bunch of little

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:34.260 
bad and you can power a bunch of little
machines<00:01:32.200> although<00:01:32.649> that's<00:01:32.830> in<00:01:33.130> my<00:01:33.759> opinion<00:01:34.060> a

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:34.270 
machines although that's in my opinion a

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:37.080 
machines although that's in my opinion a
waste<00:01:34.450> of<00:01:34.630> nuclear<00:01:34.959> power<00:01:35.520> so<00:01:36.520> you<00:01:36.550> can<00:01:36.759> tell<00:01:37.060> I

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:37.090 
waste of nuclear power so you can tell I

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.010 
waste of nuclear power so you can tell I
have<00:01:37.330> like<00:01:37.569> 10<00:01:38.110> machines<00:01:39.569> you<00:01:40.569> can<00:01:40.720> hear<00:01:40.869> the

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:41.020 
have like 10 machines you can hear the

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:42.719 
have like 10 machines you can hear the
nuclear<00:01:41.349> power<00:01:41.560> is<00:01:41.800> going<00:01:41.979> and<00:01:42.369> if<00:01:42.489> you<00:01:42.580> don't

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:42.729 
nuclear power is going and if you don't

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:45.059 
nuclear power is going and if you don't
tend<00:01:43.179> to<00:01:43.239> them<00:01:43.450> and<00:01:43.690> keep<00:01:44.470> the<00:01:44.590> coolant<00:01:44.890> cells

00:01:45.059 --> 00:01:45.069 
tend to them and keep the coolant cells

00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:47.820 
tend to them and keep the coolant cells
up<00:01:45.280> they'll<00:01:45.840> they'll<00:01:46.840> have<00:01:46.959> a<00:01:46.989> meltdown<00:01:47.349> so

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:47.830 
up they'll they'll have a meltdown so

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:51.150 
up they'll they'll have a meltdown so
let's<00:01:48.149> look<00:01:49.149> at<00:01:49.300> one<00:01:49.450> of<00:01:49.479> those<00:01:49.709> do<00:01:50.709> that<00:01:50.920> shall

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:51.160 
let's look at one of those do that shall

00:01:51.160 --> 00:02:07.010 
let's look at one of those do that shall
we

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.540 

do-do-do-do<00:02:08.020> which<00:02:08.259> is<00:02:08.410> waiting<00:02:08.649> around<00:02:09.009> with

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:09.550 
do-do-do-do which is waiting around with

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:16.420 
do-do-do-do which is waiting around with
letting<00:02:10.479> it<00:02:10.570> blow<00:02:10.780> up

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:24.809 

any<00:02:17.090> second<00:02:17.810> now

00:02:24.809 --> 00:02:24.819 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:31.140 

no<00:02:25.819> no<00:02:26.360> no<00:02:27.879> blew<00:02:28.879> up<00:02:29.110> so<00:02:30.110> let's<00:02:30.680> see<00:02:30.830> if<00:02:30.950> that

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
no no no blew up so let's see if that

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.520 
no no no blew up so let's see if that
reinforced<00:02:32.150> stone<00:02:32.390> really<00:02:32.720> did<00:02:33.019> what<00:02:33.379> it<00:02:33.470> was

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 
reinforced stone really did what it was

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:41.800 
reinforced stone really did what it was
supposed<00:02:33.590> to<00:02:34.010> do<00:02:34.160> and<00:02:34.370> and<00:02:35.530> protect<00:02:38.019> oh<00:02:40.420> no<00:02:41.420> as

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
supposed to do and and protect oh no as

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:45.640 
supposed to do and and protect oh no as
you<00:02:42.260> can<00:02:42.380> tell<00:02:43.450> Artie<00:02:44.450> some<00:02:44.630> damage<00:02:45.019> and<00:02:45.290> it

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
you can tell Artie some damage and it

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.580 
you can tell Artie some damage and it
looks<00:02:45.830> like<00:02:46.099> it<00:02:46.640> blew<00:02:47.120> the<00:02:47.959> out<00:02:48.260> of<00:02:48.290> my

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
looks like it blew the out of my

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:54.970 
looks like it blew the out of my
reactor<00:02:49.519> but<00:02:50.260> it's<00:02:51.260> all<00:02:51.470> good<00:02:51.680> I<00:02:53.709> see<00:02:54.709> a<00:02:54.739> lot<00:02:54.920> of

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
reactor but it's all good I see a lot of
