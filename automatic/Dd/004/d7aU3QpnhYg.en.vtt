00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
started with the fpv field okay so when

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:39.889 
started with the fpv field okay so when
you're<00:00:38.850> getting<00:00:38.940> ready<00:00:39.120> to<00:00:39.270> take<00:00:39.480> off<00:00:39.660> it's

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899

always<00:00:40.110> a<00:00:40.140> good<00:00:40.260> idea<00:00:40.320> to<00:00:40.649> do<00:00:41.579> your<00:00:41.730> initial

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
always a good idea to do your initial

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.369 
always a good idea to do your initial
takeoff<00:00:42.300> line<00:00:42.600> of<00:00:42.750> sight<00:00:42.930> meaning<00:00:43.260> without

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
takeoff line of sight meaning without

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.290 
takeoff line of sight meaning without
the<00:00:43.649> goggles<00:00:44.040> or<00:00:44.129> a<00:00:44.190> monitor<00:00:44.610> so<00:00:44.969> home<00:00:45.210> is

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
the goggles or a monitor so home is

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.360 
the goggles or a monitor so home is
going<00:00:45.420> to<00:00:45.510> go<00:00:45.570> ahead<00:00:45.690> and<00:00:45.809> ishy<00:00:46.020> eight<00:00:46.140> the

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:46.370 
going to go ahead and ishy eight the

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:47.990 
going to go ahead and ishy eight the
quadcopter<00:00:47.370> and<00:00:47.520> he's<00:00:47.640> going<00:00:47.760> to<00:00:47.820> go<00:00:47.940> ahead

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
quadcopter and he's going to go ahead

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.069 
quadcopter and he's going to go ahead
and<00:00:48.090> take<00:00:48.300> off<00:00:48.450> get<00:00:48.690> to<00:00:48.809> a<00:00:48.840> comfortable

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
and take off get to a comfortable

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.319 
and take off get to a comfortable
altitude<00:00:49.800> and<00:00:50.010> since<00:00:50.550> we're<00:00:50.730> using<00:00:50.760> the<00:00:51.000> DJI

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
altitude and since we're using the DJI

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.389 
altitude and since we're using the DJI
phantom<00:00:51.420> here<00:00:51.930> has<00:00:52.079> a<00:00:52.110> GPS<00:00:52.590> hold<00:00:52.860> mode<00:00:53.039> so

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
phantom here has a GPS hold mode so

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:54.709 
phantom here has a GPS hold mode so
we're<00:00:53.489> going<00:00:53.579> to<00:00:53.670> leave<00:00:53.820> it<00:00:53.940> in<00:00:54.000> that<00:00:54.180> mode<00:00:54.449> and

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
we're going to leave it in that mode and

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.060 
we're going to leave it in that mode and
we're<00:00:54.899> going<00:00:55.050> to<00:00:55.110> let<00:00:55.199> the<00:00:55.350> aircraft<00:00:55.710> take<00:00:55.920> off

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
we're going to let the aircraft take off

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.040 
we're going to let the aircraft take off
let<00:00:56.670> him<00:00:56.789> get<00:00:56.940> comfortable<00:00:57.300> let<00:00:57.780> him<00:00:57.870> put<00:00:58.020> the

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
let him get comfortable let him put the

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.869 
let him get comfortable let him put the
goggles<00:00:58.260> over<00:00:58.680> his<00:00:58.859> eyes<00:00:59.039> and<00:00:59.280> then<00:00:59.430> that<00:00:59.640> way

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
goggles over his eyes and then that way

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.010 
goggles over his eyes and then that way
it'll<00:01:00.059> give<00:01:00.210> him<00:01:00.329> a<00:01:00.359> few<00:01:00.510> seconds<00:01:00.780> for<00:01:00.870> his

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
it'll give him a few seconds for his

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.270 
it'll give him a few seconds for his
eyes<00:01:01.170> to<00:01:01.379> adjust<00:01:01.500> because<00:01:01.800> when<00:01:02.039> you're<00:01:02.160> going

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
eyes to adjust because when you're going

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.250 
eyes to adjust because when you're going
from<00:01:02.460> really<00:01:02.760> bright<00:01:03.090> to<00:01:03.270> dark<00:01:03.420> takes<00:01:04.019> a<00:01:04.110> few

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
from really bright to dark takes a few

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.420 
from really bright to dark takes a few
seconds<00:01:04.650> and<00:01:04.710> a<00:01:04.799> lot<00:01:04.949> of<00:01:04.979> things<00:01:05.220> can<00:01:05.369> happen

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
seconds and a lot of things can happen

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.039 
seconds and a lot of things can happen
in<00:01:05.760> those<00:01:05.850> few<00:01:06.060> seconds<00:01:06.390> so<00:01:06.780> let's<00:01:06.930> go<00:01:07.020> ahead

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
in those few seconds so let's go ahead

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:13.880 
in those few seconds so let's go ahead
and<00:01:07.170> take<00:01:07.260> off<00:01:11.840> whew<00:01:12.840> a<00:01:13.320> little<00:01:13.350> windy<00:01:13.530> take

facing<00:01:39.650> away<00:01:39.740> from<00:01:39.860> you<00:01:40.190> get<00:01:40.729> yourself

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 
facing away from you get yourself

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.789 
facing away from you get yourself
situated<00:01:41.420> and<00:01:41.900> then<00:01:42.140> go<00:01:42.290> ahead<00:01:42.380> and<00:01:42.500> throw<00:01:42.710> the

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:42.799 
situated and then go ahead and throw the

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:51.760 
situated and then go ahead and throw the
goggles<00:01:43.159> on<00:01:50.110> then<00:01:51.110> go<00:01:51.200> ahead<00:01:51.259> and<00:01:51.440> park<00:01:51.619> it

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770 
goggles on then go ahead and park it

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.359 
goggles on then go ahead and park it
it'll<00:01:51.950> hold<00:01:52.130> there<00:01:52.340> with<00:01:52.369> the<00:01:52.640> GPS<00:01:53.299> hold<00:01:54.369> now

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:55.369 
it'll hold there with the GPS hold now

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:57.820 
it'll hold there with the GPS hold now
you've<00:01:55.520> got<00:01:55.670> the<00:01:55.790> goggles<00:01:56.149> on<00:01:56.299> when<00:01:57.200> you<00:01:57.290> go<00:01:57.770> to

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:57.830 
you've got the goggles on when you go to

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:01.200 
you've got the goggles on when you go to
fly<00:01:58.100> quads<00:01:58.490> with<00:01:58.750> fpv<00:01:59.750> gear<00:02:00.050> quads<00:02:00.560> have<00:02:00.770> that

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:01.210 
fly quads with fpv gear quads have that

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:03.669 
fly quads with fpv gear quads have that
ability<00:02:02.210> to<00:02:02.509> stop<00:02:02.810> in<00:02:03.020> one<00:02:03.170> place<00:02:03.440> when<00:02:03.619> you're

00:02:03.669 --> 00:02:03.679 
ability to stop in one place when you're

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:05.350 
ability to stop in one place when you're
flying<00:02:03.860> a<00:02:04.039> fixed<00:02:04.190> wing<00:02:04.429> aircraft<00:02:04.610> it's<00:02:05.090> always

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:05.360 
flying a fixed wing aircraft it's always

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.050 
flying a fixed wing aircraft it's always
moving<00:02:05.690> in<00:02:05.990> the<00:02:06.289> same<00:02:06.590> fluid<00:02:07.399> motion<00:02:07.880> you<00:02:07.940> know

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060 
moving in the same fluid motion you know

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:09.940 
moving in the same fluid motion you know
given<00:02:08.450> your<00:02:08.479> changes<00:02:08.989> and<00:02:09.019> whatnot<00:02:09.410> but<00:02:09.800> when

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
given your changes and whatnot but when

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:11.410 
given your changes and whatnot but when
you're<00:02:10.070> flying<00:02:10.220> a<00:02:10.399> quad<00:02:10.670> it<00:02:10.910> has<00:02:11.120> that<00:02:11.330> ability

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
you're flying a quad it has that ability

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.720 
you're flying a quad it has that ability
stop<00:02:11.989> so<00:02:12.440> you<00:02:12.470> kind<00:02:12.739> of<00:02:12.800> have<00:02:12.920> the<00:02:13.040> sense<00:02:13.310> of<00:02:13.459> am

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
stop so you kind of have the sense of am

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.949 
stop so you kind of have the sense of am
i<00:02:13.940> moving<00:02:14.120> am<00:02:14.390> I<00:02:14.480> not<00:02:14.600> moving<00:02:15.050> so<00:02:15.530> my<00:02:16.040> best

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:16.959 
i moving am I not moving so my best

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:19.300 
i moving am I not moving so my best
suggestion<00:02:17.959> for<00:02:18.170> you<00:02:18.260> is<00:02:18.380> on<00:02:18.500> a<00:02:18.530> quad<00:02:18.800> say<00:02:19.100> like

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
suggestion for you is on a quad say like

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.250 
suggestion for you is on a quad say like
the<00:02:19.430> DJI<00:02:19.730> phantom<00:02:19.880> you<00:02:20.510> hold<00:02:20.690> forward<00:02:21.080> on<00:02:21.170> the

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
the DJI phantom you hold forward on the

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:22.990 
the DJI phantom you hold forward on the
sticks<00:02:21.560> just<00:02:21.920> a<00:02:22.010> little<00:02:22.280> bit<00:02:22.400> to<00:02:22.760> give<00:02:22.910> you

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
sticks just a little bit to give you

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.460 
sticks just a little bit to give you
that<00:02:23.150> forward<00:02:23.480> momentum<00:02:23.630> and<00:02:23.989> then<00:02:24.260> you<00:02:24.350> could

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 
that forward momentum and then you could

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:26.199 
that forward momentum and then you could
use<00:02:24.620> the<00:02:24.739> rudder<00:02:24.950> to<00:02:25.130> turn<00:02:25.340> around<00:02:25.640> just<00:02:25.910> as<00:02:26.060> if

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:26.209 
use the rudder to turn around just as if

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:28.509 
use the rudder to turn around just as if
you<00:02:26.330> would<00:02:26.480> on<00:02:26.630> an<00:02:26.750> aircraft<00:02:26.930> so<00:02:27.430> we're<00:02:28.430> at<00:02:28.489> a

00:02:28.509 --> 00:02:28.519 
you would on an aircraft so we're at a

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:29.860 
you would on an aircraft so we're at a
comfortable<00:02:28.880> altitude<00:02:29.420> here<00:02:29.630> and<00:02:29.750> he's

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
comfortable altitude here and he's

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.120 
comfortable altitude here and he's
holding<00:02:30.080> forward<00:02:30.350> on<00:02:30.530> the<00:02:30.620> sticks<00:02:30.890> and<00:02:30.980> he's

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
holding forward on the sticks and he's

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:33.009 
holding forward on the sticks and he's
going<00:02:31.310> to<00:02:31.370> use<00:02:31.459> the<00:02:31.610> rudder<00:02:31.820> to<00:02:32.090> turn<00:02:32.329> and<00:02:32.570> do

00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:33.019 
going to use the rudder to turn and do

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:37.660 
going to use the rudder to turn and do
his<00:02:33.140> maneuvers<00:02:36.100> and<00:02:37.100> remember<00:02:37.370> if<00:02:37.549> you're

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
his maneuvers and remember if you're

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:39.069 
his maneuvers and remember if you're
doing<00:02:37.940> fpv<00:02:38.360> you<00:02:38.450> want<00:02:38.630> to<00:02:38.690> start<00:02:38.810> off<00:02:38.900> with

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:39.079 
doing fpv you want to start off with

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:40.420 
doing fpv you want to start off with
baby<00:02:39.260> steps<00:02:39.410> you<00:02:39.650> don't<00:02:39.829> want<00:02:40.010> to<00:02:40.100> just<00:02:40.190> jump

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
baby steps you don't want to just jump

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:42.340 
baby steps you don't want to just jump
in<00:02:40.610> there<00:02:40.790> and<00:02:40.910> just<00:02:41.209> push<00:02:41.810> the<00:02:42.049> limits

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:42.350 
in there and just push the limits

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:44.199 
in there and just push the limits
because<00:02:42.500> a<00:02:42.890> lot<00:02:43.190> of<00:02:43.220> things<00:02:43.459> can<00:02:43.610> happen<00:02:43.790> and

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:44.209 
because a lot of things can happen and

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:45.580 
because a lot of things can happen and
you<00:02:44.420> could<00:02:44.570> lose<00:02:44.600> video<00:02:45.049> you<00:02:45.110> could<00:02:45.410> lose

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
you could lose video you could lose

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:47.590 
you could lose video you could lose
radio<00:02:46.220> control<00:02:46.760> you<00:02:47.120> want<00:02:47.299> to<00:02:47.360> be<00:02:47.420> prepared

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:47.600 
radio control you want to be prepared

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.509 
radio control you want to be prepared
for<00:02:47.870> that<00:02:47.989> stuff<00:02:48.320> so<00:02:48.620> fly<00:02:48.860> within<00:02:49.100> your<00:02:49.310> range

00:02:49.509 --> 00:02:49.519 
for that stuff so fly within your range

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:51.190 
for that stuff so fly within your range
fly<00:02:49.820> within<00:02:50.030> your<00:02:50.239> means<00:02:50.390> understand<00:02:51.049> your

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
fly within your means understand your

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.080 
fly within your means understand your
equipment<00:02:51.620> as<00:02:51.709> well<00:02:51.829> too<00:02:52.070> at<00:02:52.760> this<00:02:52.910> point

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
equipment as well too at this point

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:56.050 
equipment as well too at this point
we're<00:02:53.299> just<00:02:53.480> flying<00:02:53.570> to<00:02:54.410> a<00:02:54.769> very<00:02:55.489> short<00:02:55.760> space

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
we're just flying to a very short space

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:57.699 
we're just flying to a very short space
and<00:02:56.329> you've<00:02:56.750> got<00:02:56.870> a<00:02:56.930> spotter<00:02:57.230> there<00:02:57.440> that<00:02:57.590> can

00:02:57.699 --> 00:02:57.709 
and you've got a spotter there that can

00:02:57.709 --> 00:02:59.110 
and you've got a spotter there that can
take<00:02:57.859> the<00:02:58.010> radio<00:02:58.280> from<00:02:58.489> him<00:02:58.640> at<00:02:58.790> any<00:02:58.850> point

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
take the radio from him at any point

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.120 
take the radio from him at any point
that<00:02:59.299> he<00:02:59.420> has<00:02:59.540> either<00:02:59.690> a<00:02:59.780> video<00:03:00.079> glitch<00:03:00.290> or<00:03:00.440> a

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.130 
that he has either a video glitch or a

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:03.520 
that he has either a video glitch or a
radio<00:03:01.760> glitch<00:03:02.180> you<00:03:02.810> got<00:03:02.930> somebody<00:03:03.170> there<00:03:03.440> with

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.530 
radio glitch you got somebody there with

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:08.600 
radio glitch you got somebody there with
an<00:03:03.680> eye<00:03:03.769> on<00:03:03.799> the<00:03:04.040> aircraft

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:10.650 

another<00:03:09.610> thing<00:03:09.850> to<00:03:10.000> remember<00:03:10.030> is<00:03:10.420> when<00:03:10.510> you're

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660 
another thing to remember is when you're

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:13.830 
another thing to remember is when you're
flying<00:03:10.840> fpv<00:03:11.820> you're<00:03:12.820> so<00:03:13.030> immersed<00:03:13.360> into<00:03:13.600> what

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 
flying fpv you're so immersed into what

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.870 
flying fpv you're so immersed into what
you're<00:03:13.960> doing<00:03:14.230> you're<00:03:14.610> basically<00:03:15.610> you<00:03:15.700> feel

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:15.880 
you're doing you're basically you feel

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:16.980 
you're doing you're basically you feel
like<00:03:16.030> you're<00:03:16.150> the<00:03:16.270> pilot<00:03:16.450> of<00:03:16.660> that<00:03:16.810> aircraft

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:16.990 
like you're the pilot of that aircraft

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:19.310 
like you're the pilot of that aircraft
you<00:03:17.290> forget<00:03:17.620> about<00:03:17.710> things<00:03:18.040> you<00:03:18.130> forget<00:03:18.400> about

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:19.320 
you forget about things you forget about

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:21.270 
you forget about things you forget about
structures<00:03:20.320> you<00:03:20.500> forget<00:03:20.770> about<00:03:20.860> different

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
structures you forget about different

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:22.800 
structures you forget about different
obstacles<00:03:21.490> that<00:03:21.760> you<00:03:21.820> may<00:03:21.970> hit<00:03:22.180> another<00:03:22.600> thing
