00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.720
 and hundreds of media not yet forget 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:19.750
 for minecraft in its version 1.7 points 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:22.390
 2 today I bring you a mod that the only thing 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:23.800
 we do is add the items to the part 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:25.630
 decorative to our game to the part of 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:27.009
 what to decoration 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:28.960
 and as you can see I have everything 

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:31.179
 prepared so let's go to them for 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.760
 start the mod and what it brings us 

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:37.079
 as you can see this will allow us to create 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:37.079
 statues of the different 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:42.940
 enemy animals of the game this is 

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:44.920
 there is a giant zombie that does 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.090
 there's after we'll have to enter another 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.379
 mode also if you want to show a zombie 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:50.920
 Ghent 

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:55.329
 here a ghost is growing that is 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:58.210
 a crit but a skeleton a spider a 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:01:00.760
 zombie a in derman another hairline of that 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:04.540
 generous cave here is the famous 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:06.130
 dragon of the game as you can see what 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:08.860
 I have in stone but we can 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:13.220
 breathe in wood stone and I think that 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:16.670
 now there is another one of the game modes 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:19.910
 although there was a bat a witch a 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:22.730
 piglet a chicken this is what is this 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:23.970
 a sheep and extras that attacked a 

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:27.540
 little cow 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:30.330
 besides this he also adds us 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.250
 these little flags that we can 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:33.930
 use for decoration as well as all 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.440
 item those who are there already the 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.710
 engines 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:40.710
 this attack adds a ticket or 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:44.050
 we can destroy the then by these 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:46.690
 It also adds a watch as they can 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:48.880
 see that this clock counting and ringing every 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:51.250
 Once you equally well 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.710
 add as a kind of mini world 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:54.790
 how can you see this action of the clock 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.920
 I do not think that this species adds us 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:02:00.220
 from my world this one adds us the 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:02.440
 little door all the details 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.910
 now that he's pretty cool too 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:06.610
 it adds what is saying this that 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:09.610
 is here that is to put the weapon that 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:11.710
 later I have it there but 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:13.490
 right now in him I have what saying 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:15.800
 he also adds us 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:18.320
 March from drum as you can see 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:20.300
 they are like that but if you selected the deck with 

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:21.890
 Right click may sound quite hard 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.500
 and it is in that it lowered a little 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:27.850
 volume at 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:33.120
 to the east so that they remain deaf 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:36.530
 and then as you can see there it sounds 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.530
 and well let's go there 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:41.910
 I will turn up the volume because 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:44.080
 until now I have nothing so there 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:45.790
 a lot of noise 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.810
 good also adds what is being 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:51.810
 these pedestals are 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:54.360
 6p see stable five cards in in 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:57.450
 concrete and in each of them we can 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:59.670
 put at least I have here 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:01.230
 the transport wand that adds me the 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:03.209
 mold creatures that is already the 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:05.010
 channel right click on it and then I 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:07.080
 put the wand there to take it from 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:09.120
 same way right click and in the shot 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:11.050
 is the one to put that way is the place 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:16.770
 A) Yes 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:19.170
 this puts her floating path adds those 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:20.790
 species of little flags 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:23.190
 as you can see they were exploding and 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:25.470
 Well, there are some readings from there 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:27.210
 all weird 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:29.670
 to take it you can right click and the 

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:31.920
 we simply take the transport is 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:36.569
 amazing and this is another 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:38.310
 but with a sword and then we're going to 

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:40.620
 to see these two that are the most 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:43.110
 I like those that look pretty 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:44.610
 good accent make the game and how 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:48.060
 you can see this we put our 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:50.180
 sword and a kind of lights between a 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:51.950
 glow around her 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:55.100
 equally we can also put in 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:56.720
 this I put my 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:59.400
 pamper and treat transportation as 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:01.019
 can see this answer is bigger 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.530
 and the truth is that that looks pretty 

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:05.680
 pretty good 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:07.069
 as well as let me remove so that 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:10.000
 the claw 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:13.810
 take it to see 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:18.660
 Wait for a moment, I already have the one 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:18.660
 I'll make it good for this 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:24.050
 also as I told you between where I have 

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:27.030
 already the deck because this one is doing here 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:30.540
 here is the store as here I have my 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:31.890
 sword and how was I telling you that 

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:33.090
 we can put our weapons that I have 

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:35.800
 a sword then right click on it and 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:39.840
 we take the sword 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:39.840
 to see here we have the ax 

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:45.400
 we'll see the little stick and here we have what 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:47.440
 it's still the peak 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:51.270
 good to place the same way click 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:51.270
 right in it and we place it 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:58.330
 he does not believe he practices movement 

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:58.330
 the truth is pretty good 

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:02.270
 also add this table where where 

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:05.090
 we will be able to place what we exert 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:07.220
 our our meals as you can see 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:08.790
 here below I have the food click 

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:10.620
 right in there there 

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:12.270
 we have the food or also if we want 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:14.180
 place our weapons we also hope 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:18.620
 place there 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:21.300
 and the truth that is pretty good is 

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:23.849
 what are we going to do next 

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:26.400
 adds a closet and then why 

00:05:23.849 --> 00:05:30.599
 serve this we click on it as they can 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:33.680
 see leather diamond mesh or 

00:05:30.599 --> 00:05:33.680
 golden gold 

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:40.660
 there I have my gold chest 

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:42.460
 the goal for gold and also adds 

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:45.250
 in this part here two artists can not 

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:48.570
 see I have pants pants 

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:48.570
 and wap here 

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:54.199
 and do not add the kittens 

00:05:58.039 --> 00:06:02.900
 we go as you can see I have my 

00:06:00.389 --> 00:06:06.220
 shoes and all the wood issue 

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:09.220
 also do not add this mini 

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:12.130
 as well as to place buy 

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:15.400
 this way girl buy and I have 

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:17.470
 making the sword the peak and 

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:19.780
 sees it 

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:22.360
 now the field and to win equal 

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:25.660
 Right click way and to put the same 

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:27.430
 right click and placed those of 

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:30.100
 connery in these networks that is here that 

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:32.400
 the truth that since it came down a bit 

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:32.400
 of volume 

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:40.360
 and this one has pretty animation 

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:49.380
 of average back 

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:55.009
 and good as you can see this has a 

00:06:52.909 --> 00:06:56.360
 pretty strange investment with the sword 

00:06:55.009 --> 00:06:58.069
 I do not know if it serves to molar the truth that 

00:06:56.360 --> 00:07:00.160
 I have tried and I do not know what this 

00:06:58.069 --> 00:07:04.140
