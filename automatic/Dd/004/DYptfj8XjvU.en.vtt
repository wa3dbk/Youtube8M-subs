00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.610 
i have two Malaysian buzzers and an axe
of<00:00:44.160> despair<00:00:44.629> any<00:00:45.629> other<00:00:46.170> thing<00:00:46.440> would<00:00:46.559> work

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
of despair any other thing would work

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.310 
of despair any other thing would work
too<00:00:47.010> like<00:00:47.309> black<00:00:47.730> pendant<00:00:48.000> or<00:00:48.239> anything<00:00:48.629> but

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
too like black pendant or anything but

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.380 
too like black pendant or anything but
cards<00:00:49.590> like<00:00:49.710> that<00:00:49.860> are<00:00:49.980> pretty<00:00:50.100> good<00:00:50.340> I<00:00:50.579> think

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
cards like that are pretty good I think

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.680 
cards like that are pretty good I think
a<00:00:51.829> second<00:00:52.829> turn<00:00:52.980> that<00:00:53.160> I<00:00:53.219> uses<00:00:53.730> effect<00:00:54.059> I<00:00:54.300> would

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
a second turn that I uses effect I would

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.229 
a second turn that I uses effect I would
equipped<00:00:54.930> him<00:00:55.050> with<00:00:55.079> any<00:00:55.800> one<00:00:56.550> of<00:00:56.610> these<00:00:56.789> cards

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
equipped him with any one of these cards

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.439 
equipped him with any one of these cards
because<00:00:57.960> double<00:00:58.530> tool<00:00:58.680> C&amp;D<00:00:58.890> is<00:00:59.280> an<00:00:59.640> amazing

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
because double tool C&amp;D is an amazing

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.810 
because double tool C&amp;D is an amazing
card<00:01:00.660> it's<00:01:00.870> just<00:01:01.140> one<00:01:01.590> of<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:02.039> greatest<00:01:02.399> cards

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
card it's just one of the greatest cards

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.609 
card it's just one of the greatest cards
I've<00:01:02.940> been<00:01:02.969> so<00:01:03.390> broken<00:01:03.840> like<00:01:04.019> they<00:01:04.199> have<00:01:04.409> to

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
I've been so broken like they have to

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.520 
I've been so broken like they have to
attack<00:01:04.949> him<00:01:05.189> and<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:06.600> Maserati<00:01:07.290> gets

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
attack him and the Maserati gets

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.890 
attack him and the Maserati gets
destroyed<00:01:07.860> it's<00:01:08.100> just<00:01:08.340> so<00:01:09.180> good<00:01:09.479> why<00:01:09.750> do<00:01:09.810> you

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
destroyed it's just so good why do you

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.450 
destroyed it's just so good why do you
do<00:01:10.080> it<00:01:10.110> second<00:01:10.530> turn<00:01:10.680> instead<00:01:11.010> of<00:01:11.220> first

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
do it second turn instead of first

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.700 
do it second turn instead of first
because<00:01:12.030> it<00:01:12.330> doesn't<00:01:12.720> increase<00:01:13.229> his<00:01:13.409> attack

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
because it doesn't increase his attack

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.179 
because it doesn't increase his attack
the<00:01:13.920> first<00:01:14.159> turn<00:01:14.780> because<00:01:16.070> when<00:01:17.070> you're

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
the first turn because when you're

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.520 
the first turn because when you're
appointed<00:01:17.430> it's<00:01:18.150> your<00:01:18.420> opponent's<00:01:19.200> turn<00:01:19.320> they

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
appointed it's your opponent's turn they

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.249 
appointed it's your opponent's turn they
like<00:01:19.939> it<00:01:20.939> doesn't<00:01:21.119> gain<00:01:21.390> a<00:01:21.420> thousand<00:01:21.810> Texas

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
like it doesn't gain a thousand Texas

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.649 
like it doesn't gain a thousand Texas
still<00:01:22.500> 23<00:01:22.860> and<00:01:23.189> easier<00:01:23.430> to<00:01:23.610> destroy<00:01:24.030> ok

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
still 23 and easier to destroy ok

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.539 
still 23 and easier to destroy ok
alright<00:01:25.140> the<00:01:25.350> third<00:01:25.560> turn<00:01:25.799> I<00:01:25.979> would<00:01:26.189> take<00:01:26.369> out

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
alright the third turn I would take out

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.030

use Big Bang shock but I I don't think

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.170 
use Big Bang shock but I I don't think
Big<00:01:36.540> Bang<00:01:36.720> chatah's<00:01:37.110> that's<00:01:37.259> good<00:01:37.470> because<00:01:38.180> if

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
Big Bang chatah's that's good because if

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.480 
Big Bang chatah's that's good because if

basically I just use him for a synchro
summoning<00:03:30.090> but<00:03:30.390> sometimes<00:03:31.230> he's<00:03:31.410> pretty<00:03:31.620> good

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:31.830 
summoning but sometimes he's pretty good

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:33.830 
summoning but sometimes he's pretty good
in<00:03:32.670> order<00:03:32.910> to<00:03:32.970> destroy<00:03:33.330> your<00:03:33.480> opponent's

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
in order to destroy your opponent's

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.140 
in order to destroy your opponent's
cards<00:03:34.019> because<00:03:34.410> that's<00:03:34.620> really<00:03:34.769> necessary<00:03:35.550> in

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
cards because that's really necessary in

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.630 
cards because that's really necessary in
a<00:03:36.239> deck<00:03:36.420> these<00:03:36.630> days<00:03:36.920> especially<00:03:37.920> if<00:03:38.370> I<00:03:38.459> have<00:03:38.610> a

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.640 
a deck these days especially if I have a

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:41.000 
a deck these days especially if I have a
morphtronic<00:03:38.940> celfon<00:03:39.540> on<00:03:39.630> the<00:03:39.750> field<00:03:39.989> and<00:03:40.230> it's

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
morphtronic celfon on the field and it's

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.009 
morphtronic celfon on the field and it's
unprotected<00:03:41.670> I<00:03:41.790> can<00:03:41.940> usually<00:03:42.030> just<00:03:42.390> get<00:03:42.870> this

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:43.019 
unprotected I can usually just get this

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:45.199 
unprotected I can usually just get this
out<00:03:43.200> with<00:03:43.380> self<00:03:43.590> on<00:03:43.799> should<00:03:44.459> be<00:03:44.489> self<00:03:45.000> on

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 
out with self on should be self on

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:46.820 
out with self on should be self on
destroy<00:03:45.690> card<00:03:45.959> and<00:03:46.110> then<00:03:46.230> I<00:03:46.380> won't<00:03:46.620> have<00:03:46.650> to

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:46.830 
destroy card and then I won't have to

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:49.039 
destroy card and then I won't have to
worry<00:03:46.980> about<00:03:47.040> them<00:03:47.400> attacking<00:03:48.239> a<00:03:48.540> really<00:03:48.900> weak

00:03:49.039 --> 00:03:49.049 
worry about them attacking a really weak

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:52.550 
worry about them attacking a really weak
monster<00:03:49.500> like<00:03:49.650> that<00:03:50.299> so<00:03:51.299> three<00:03:51.750> cellphones<00:03:52.019> I

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
monster like that so three cellphones I

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.259 
monster like that so three cellphones I
think<00:03:53.070> this<00:03:53.160> is<00:03:53.310> an<00:03:53.400> important<00:03:53.760> card<00:03:53.910> to<00:03:54.000> deck

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:54.269 
think this is an important card to deck

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:56.180 
think this is an important card to deck
because<00:03:54.480> it<00:03:54.630> allows<00:03:54.810> you<00:03:54.989> to<00:03:55.140> special<00:03:56.040> summon

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 
because it allows you to special summon

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:57.949 
because it allows you to special summon
cards<00:03:56.640> like<00:03:56.790> this<00:03:57.030> which<00:03:57.540> can<00:03:57.720> help<00:03:57.810> you

00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:57.959 
cards like this which can help you

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:01.130 
cards like this which can help you
synchro<00:03:58.290> summon<00:03:58.590> later<00:03:58.799> on<00:03:59.040> and<00:03:59.959> it's<00:04:00.959> just

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:01.140 
synchro summon later on and it's just

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:02.600

amazing<00:04:01.290> special<00:04:01.890> summoning<00:04:02.250> is<00:04:02.340> really

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:02.610 
amazing special summoning is really

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:05.900 
amazing special summoning is really
important<00:04:03.030> in<00:04:03.660> the<00:04:03.810> stick<00:04:04.049> because<00:04:04.910> special

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:05.910 
important in the stick because special

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:07.910 
important in the stick because special
summoning<00:04:06.330> is<00:04:06.450> where<00:04:06.750> it's<00:04:06.900> at<00:04:07.049> which<00:04:07.620> is<00:04:07.769> why

instead<00:04:47.640> of<00:04:47.850> three<00:04:47.940> just<00:04:48.450> because<00:04:48.780> I<00:04:49.190> since

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:50.190 
instead of three just because I since

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:51.800 
instead of three just because I since
you're<00:04:50.310> usually<00:04:50.490> playing<00:04:50.970> power<00:04:51.210> tool<00:04:51.480> dragon

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:51.810 
you're usually playing power tool dragon

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:54.050 
you're usually playing power tool dragon
more<00:04:51.930> of<00:04:52.020> the<00:04:52.140> time<00:04:52.350> um<00:04:52.590> you<00:04:53.580> wouldn't<00:04:53.700> use

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:54.060 
more of the time um you wouldn't use

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:57.200 
more of the time um you wouldn't use
this<00:04:54.240> all<00:04:54.480> the<00:04:54.510> time<00:04:54.690> so<00:04:55.520> it<00:04:56.520> just<00:04:56.790> could<00:04:57.030> be<00:04:57.060> a

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:57.210 
this all the time so it just could be a

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:59.510 
this all the time so it just could be a
dead<00:04:57.420> draw<00:04:57.660> at<00:04:57.750> some<00:04:57.930> points<00:04:58.290> but<00:04:58.470> that's<00:04:59.370> why

00:04:59.510 --> 00:04:59.520 
dead draw at some points but that's why

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:01.730 
dead draw at some points but that's why
I<00:04:59.550> play<00:04:59.760> it<00:04:59.850> at<00:04:59.940> to<00:05:00.120> house<00:05:01.050> a<00:05:01.170> good<00:05:01.320> morph<00:05:01.500> track

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:01.740 
I play it at to house a good morph track

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:03.680 
I play it at to house a good morph track
monsters<00:05:02.190> our<00:05:02.400> morphtronic<00:05:03.060> Cameron<00:05:03.480> and

monsters our morphtronic Cameron and
more<00:05:04.230> track<00:05:04.440> Borden<00:05:05.130> because<00:05:05.640> he<00:05:05.790> can<00:05:05.940> make

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:06.090 
more track Borden because he can make

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:08.390 
more track Borden because he can make
them<00:05:06.240> attack<00:05:06.510> directly<00:05:06.900> and<00:05:07.230> he's<00:05:07.950> just<00:05:08.130> good

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:08.400 
them attack directly and he's just good

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:09.890 
them attack directly and he's just good
for<00:05:08.520> special<00:05:08.910> summoning<00:05:09.270> and<00:05:09.390> stuff<00:05:09.630> and

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:09.900 
for special summoning and stuff and

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:11.990 
for special summoning and stuff and
their<00:05:10.860> defense<00:05:11.160> position<00:05:11.550> effects<00:05:11.850> are

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:12.000 
their defense position effects are

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.030 
their defense position effects are
really<00:05:12.210> good<00:05:12.360> too<00:05:12.510> because<00:05:12.750> these<00:05:13.350> stops<00:05:13.620> were

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:14.040 
really good too because these stops were

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:15.740 
really good too because these stops were
trying<00:05:14.280> some<00:05:14.430> being<00:05:14.640> targeted<00:05:15.060> and<00:05:15.210> then<00:05:15.630> he

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:15.750 
trying some being targeted and then he

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:17.090 
trying some being targeted and then he
stopped<00:05:15.990> some<00:05:16.140> tracks<00:05:16.440> from<00:05:16.560> being<00:05:16.830> attacked

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:17.100 
stopped some tracks from being attacked

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:19.400 
stopped some tracks from being attacked
so<00:05:17.220> together<00:05:17.430> they<00:05:17.790> work<00:05:17.940> really<00:05:18.180> well<00:05:18.410> but

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:19.410 
so together they work really well but

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:21.050 
so together they work really well but
their<00:05:19.890> best<00:05:20.070> in<00:05:20.220> defense<00:05:20.520> position<00:05:20.640> and

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:21.060 
their best in defense position and

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:23.450 
their best in defense position and
that's<00:05:21.210> kind<00:05:21.450> of<00:05:21.540> hard<00:05:21.750> so<00:05:22.560> that's<00:05:23.280> why<00:05:23.400> I

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:23.460 
that's kind of hard so that's why I

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:25.130 
that's kind of hard so that's why I
don't<00:05:23.550> usually<00:05:23.880> use<00:05:24.180> them<00:05:24.480> and<00:05:24.690> they're<00:05:25.110> only

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:25.140 
don't usually use them and they're only

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:27.260 
don't usually use them and they're only
played<00:05:25.500> at<00:05:25.650> one<00:05:25.830> they<00:05:26.460> also<00:05:26.640> play<00:05:26.850> gadget

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:27.270 
played at one they also play gadget

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:29.810 
played at one they also play gadget
driver<00:05:27.480> at<00:05:27.660> one<00:05:27.870> because<00:05:28.370> although<00:05:29.370> some<00:05:29.700> of

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:29.820 
driver at one because although some of

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:32.540 
driver at one because although some of
the<00:05:30.030> morph<00:05:30.540> track<00:05:30.920> defense<00:05:31.920> position<00:05:32.280> effects

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:32.550 
the morph track defense position effects

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:34.730 
the morph track defense position effects
are<00:05:32.670> pretty<00:05:32.790> good<00:05:33.090> I<00:05:33.330> don't<00:05:33.720> think<00:05:33.930> it's<00:05:34.590> the

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:34.740 
are pretty good I don't think it's the

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:36.350 
are pretty good I don't think it's the
most<00:05:34.860> necessary<00:05:35.100> part<00:05:35.610> of<00:05:35.640> the<00:05:35.760> deck<00:05:35.940> so<00:05:36.150> I

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:36.360 
most necessary part of the deck so I

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:37.880 
most necessary part of the deck so I
have<00:05:36.570> him<00:05:36.690> that<00:05:36.810> one<00:05:36.990> just<00:05:37.230> to<00:05:37.350> switch<00:05:37.590> cards

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:37.890 
have him that one just to switch cards

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:39.920 
have him that one just to switch cards
like<00:05:38.070> this<00:05:38.250> into<00:05:38.610> defense<00:05:38.910> mode<00:05:39.000> pretty

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:39.930 
like this into defense mode pretty

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:43.820 
like this into defense mode pretty
easily<00:05:40.140> and<00:05:40.940> it's<00:05:41.940> good<00:05:42.260> all<00:05:43.260> right<00:05:43.350> these<00:05:43.620> are
