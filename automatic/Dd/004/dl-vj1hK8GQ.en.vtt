00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:05.560
 and 

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:09.150
 ah 

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:12.389
 ah 

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:20.040
 it's like welcome another moment that 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.650
 they saw it in the future title of lcd 

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:24.779
 big pets auto 5 online then 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.119
 let's start is a little mystery 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.860
 a small mishap of what I see that 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.990
 maybe to the later they can all be 

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:32.519
 let's start teaching them everything 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.980
 that I believe and let me collect this that I 

00:00:32.519 --> 00:00:36.750
 there's a gang attack and then you're done 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.910
 having said that we are going to start and 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.010
 look when knowing here is what is going 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.600
 doing a pet store but the 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.610
 true this pet store looks very 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.500
 well done in my opinion the truth that is 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.820
 he sees very well and as you see they are pets of 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.469
 what they are selling today apart from that 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.390
 I've seen quite a few things in what 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.070
 making great pictures 5 online then 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.399
 it can be everything I'm here as it says 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.590
 come says in pet limited edition 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.629
 Rotella limit that limited edition 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.309
 then with this we can realize 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.080
 that probably goes to 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.850
 have some dlc that allow us to have 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.380
 in what are being pets and right now 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.119
 I'm going to show you another little thing that I saw 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.560
 here I do not think it's on 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.690
 free but also I think that you 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.220
 they put on something and as you see here in 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:14.880
 this part of what he does is not 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.560
 entry 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.709
 they come to see people to take my 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.120
 weapon but then the insurance the cell phone and 

00:01:19.709 --> 00:01:23.400
 see how they put 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:25.110
 dogs then here we can see that there 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.730
 a little bit more than doing everything 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.710
 this apart from that there are quite a few things 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:30.570
 now let's go to a part of the map 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.890
 that they would be left would wish to be 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.720
 to explain the pet store that there 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.030
 one here and there is another one for another location 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.460
 Well the location is right here 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.230
 This is where you can see what a 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.730
 pet latina ok we're all going to 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:43.710
 mark the other location that I wanted them 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:44.970
 teach because there is another mystery 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.980
 of a pet that the truth is made to me 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.810
 quite weird ok then let's go 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:51.870
 just for now I can not have the 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:54.060
 helicopter practically because we 

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:56.700
 landed one but the asshole crashed and 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.140
 he died then they do not let me ask him 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.490
 another merriweather helicopter but 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.350
 right now we arrived as they see it 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.270
 it's not that far away and there are a few 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.160
 miles the truth that is not much and 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.260
 if we cut the road much less 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:09.000
 we are going to travel then we are going 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.740
 going a little bit here you know 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.050
 that I take my shortcuts in a big way 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:15.030
 I do not pay much attention to radar 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.500
 that I take my own shortcuts and the 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.750
 truth that is not so far come as 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.760
 come and we cut a lot of crash road 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:23.040
 then they stop us from marking the road to verÃ³n 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.630
 be more here and the bad of this car 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.920
 is that it does not have as good traction is 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:28.020
 very good the car has very good 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.170
 acceleration but what I do feel that 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.000
 yes 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.620
 missing a lot is what is doing that is 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.510
 attach more to the floor that is not so 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.400
 good fixation as what you are doing 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.860
 one of then we are going to go here or 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.780
 which father passes between those two trees and 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.489
 if anything else I wanted to tell you how 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.800
 well they will remember me to leave what they do 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:45.420
 to the timeshare in big missed 5 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:47.640
 online but one thing that I wanted them 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:49.560
 to say with all that the timeshare is 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.300
 how are other departments going to be put 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.430
 bigger and bigger things like 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:56.010
 houses then maybe we already here 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.720
 allow to have what are being pets 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:59.700
 and the now would be something that remains pretty 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.440
 well then right now we're going to get 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.180
 fast done no longer down we are three short 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:05.400
 kilometers so it's nothing when 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.480
 we call as in a straight line and if I 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.700
 I think these things of what is going 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.890
 doing the pet store not so 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:12.720
 they are set up for free because of 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:15.209
 because I would practically be very stupid 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:17.260
 put something in big football to impose it 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:20.610
 it's like putting I do not know 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:22.450
 and careful attention to the 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:24.129
 extraterrestrials when on earth in 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:25.989
 the anonymous extraterrestrial that you put 

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:28.360
 on the road not careful 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:30.730
 extraterrestrials to ten meters and then not 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:32.590
 there's no extraterrestrials there are not 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:34.569
 is a crude example that I wanted to bring 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:36.879
 but then if it's something rather dumb 

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:38.650
 it does not make any sense to put in 

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:40.720
 a pet tub and nobody is going to sell 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:43.239
 pets I do not know is like they put a 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:45.190
 toy store and I do not know do not sell 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:46.720
 toys is pretty weird not then 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:49.870
 having said that what we are going to do 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:51.250
 it's practically getting to them 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:53.650
 teach another mystery that pleases me 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:55.120
 it seemed quite curious I do not know if 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:56.590
 is in what you do big with your 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:58.150
 history but yes that is in big 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:59.829
 car there is not anything else that they have as 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:01.209
 that this free bet is what goes 

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:03.040
 doing the casino because tell me to 

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:05.079
 that never but also if you never 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:07.239
 is going to use then it's kind of silly that's not 

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:09.280
 I know if they put it on purpose or for what purpose 

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:11.500
 they put it but if order would be another 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:13.480
 mystery and quite apart because of the 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:15.069
 pets not apart from that they would be 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:17.320
 pretty good imagine you could 

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:19.359
 bring your top and even if I kill it 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:20.829
 then simply that when you the 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:22.780
 kill when you go to your house I appear 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:23.950
 again like when they destroy you a 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:26.710
 car and gives parents 

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:28.090
 in your car and massmutual and you appear 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:30.310
 in your garage again then I do not think 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:31.870
 that has nothing of conflict is the one that 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:34.000
 can you put your name that you can 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:36.040
 have a horse because there are also 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.380
 stables in the game I say for what 

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:39.460
 stables and they're going to practically never 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:41.290
 They will be putting the see this 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:43.360
 prostitute right now I do not care about 

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:44.890
 I care about right now while you not then 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:46.600
 look at the here practically what they 

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:47.980
 I wanted to teach, let's take our 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:49.690
 phone so that they can appreciate 

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:52.540
 here on the board ok 

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:54.610
 look how they see it here will take us out this 

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:57.130
 ad to see if I notice more because I do not 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:59.830
 I noticed pretty well let's look at 

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:02.250
 the character ok ones that we have 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:05.140
 fixed well as in here it says rain 

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:07.090
 lost dog reward a friends 

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:09.400
 here he says that he lost a friend and 

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:12.460
 There he says you can call him and he says 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:14.320
 last seen in the garden and with 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:16.960
 you will see a puppy and as you see offer 

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:19.120
 of what goes reward thousand 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:20.500
 dollars and there I'll take out the number and how 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:22.840
 come I do not think this is 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:24.520
 practically foolish but 

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:26.980
 it makes sense to put something like that myself 

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:29.200
 I think they would not put something like that we give the 

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:30.260
 light of the end then I put it and then 

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:32.270
 there is left no 

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:34.070
 I believe that if some future may be 

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:35.900
 in what doing some dlc with 

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:37.550
 pets that you can have even your 

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:39.860
 horse your dog and take to do something 

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:42.380
 that looks pretty good and that says rooster 

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:44.390
 lost good only matters then only 

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:45.590
 do you like the video today you tell me in 

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:47.990
 the comments that you think you can 

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:49.690
 pass believe that something like this can happen or 

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:52.130
 this is a simple theory and nothing else 

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:54.080
 I tell you what I think of why 

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:55.400
 all these things are here and so 

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:56.900
 I hope you would not forget to 

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:58.790
 give you like favorites subscribe to 

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:03.070
 channel if they are not subscribed without more than 

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:03.070
 say goodbye goodbye
