00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:18.109
 I hooked the sides but he leads the bracelet 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:20.180
 we are now in a circle right 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:24.500

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:30.190

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:33.370

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:36.970
 from the finger and here of course there will be a bunch 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:36.970
 I enter 5 

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:49.120

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:54.279

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:59.249
 call it a fork quest and take off on 

00:04:54.279 --> 00:05:01.889
 her neat hook takes out a 

00:04:59.249 --> 00:05:05.969
 then weaving usually begins 

00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:14.129
 green rezinochkoy inside red 

00:05:05.969 --> 00:05:19.469
 two things you can take by hand 

00:05:14.129 --> 00:05:19.469
 crochet then 2 greenbacks 

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:29.010
 as you can see very simple weaving and 

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:33.930
 pretty cute bracelet turns out 

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:36.000
 very simple i'm showing slowly can 

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:38.550
 do pretty quickly over 

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:43.040
 five to seven minutes so small 

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:43.040
 bracelet on the child's handle 

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:08.630
 so how much of 1 2 3 4 4 is enough for now 

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:11.070

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:13.680

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:26.010
 done quickly and easily and simply 

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:29.400
 the result is a nice bracelet 

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:33.270
