get asked a fair bit

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.770 
get asked a fair bit
I<00:00:09.990> also<00:00:10.650> answered<00:00:11.340> this<00:00:11.460> question<00:00:11.700> in<00:00:12.269> my

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
I also answered this question in my

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.600 
I also answered this question in my
which<00:00:13.110> bowel<00:00:13.349> song<00:00:13.620> should<00:00:13.830> you<00:00:13.920> buy<00:00:14.070> video<00:00:14.309> so

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
which bowel song should you buy video so

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:15.939 
which bowel song should you buy video so
you<00:00:14.700> can<00:00:14.790> check<00:00:14.849> that<00:00:15.089> one<00:00:15.299> out<00:00:15.630> as<00:00:15.780> well

00:00:15.939 --> 00:00:15.949 
you can check that one out as well

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:18.230 
you can check that one out as well
because<00:00:16.949> this<00:00:17.310> will<00:00:17.460> be<00:00:17.580> a<00:00:17.609> little<00:00:17.789> bit<00:00:18.000> more

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
because this will be a little bit more

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.410 
because this will be a little bit more
quick<00:00:18.779> to<00:00:19.590> the<00:00:19.619> point<00:00:19.980> than<00:00:20.250> that<00:00:20.460> one<00:00:20.670> I'm

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
quick to the point than that one I'm

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:22.849 
quick to the point than that one I'm
going<00:00:21.570> to<00:00:21.630> be<00:00:21.689> talking<00:00:21.869> about<00:00:22.050> the<00:00:22.289> small<00:00:22.529> fly

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
going to be talking about the small fly

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.640 
going to be talking about the small fly
versus<00:00:23.279> the<00:00:23.400> bee<00:00:23.580> m32<00:00:24.510> which<00:00:25.109> one<00:00:25.320> I<00:00:25.470> like

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
versus the bee m32 which one I like

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.170 
versus the bee m32 which one I like
better<00:00:25.830> and<00:00:26.130> which<00:00:26.220> one<00:00:26.430> you<00:00:26.550> should<00:00:26.580> get<00:00:26.939> if

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
better and which one you should get if

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.380 
better and which one you should get if
you're<00:00:27.359> looking<00:00:27.689> at<00:00:27.810> a<00:00:27.840> small<00:00:28.199> sized<00:00:28.470> Valley

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:29.390 
you're looking at a small sized Valley

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:33.380 
you're looking at a small sized Valley
my<00:00:31.160> personal<00:00:32.160> preference<00:00:32.520> is<00:00:32.700> the<00:00:32.880> small<00:00:33.120> fly

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
my personal preference is the small fly

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.430 
my personal preference is the small fly
I<00:00:33.660> think<00:00:34.110> for<00:00:34.770> a<00:00:34.800> few<00:00:35.010> reasons<00:00:35.130> one<00:00:36.079> it's<00:00:37.079> a<00:00:37.230> way

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
I think for a few reasons one it's a way

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.250 
I think for a few reasons one it's a way
more<00:00:37.770> unique-looking<00:00:38.280> flipper<00:00:39.120> it's<00:00:39.870> its<00:00:40.079> own

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
more unique-looking flipper it's its own

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.049 
more unique-looking flipper it's its own
kind<00:00:40.620> of<00:00:40.680> little<00:00:40.920> design<00:00:41.250> actually<00:00:41.579> I<00:00:41.820> guess

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
kind of little design actually I guess

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.810 
kind of little design actually I guess
32<00:00:43.050> is<00:00:43.170> just<00:00:43.379> a<00:00:43.440> smaller<00:00:43.710> 51<00:00:44.250> and<00:00:44.489> the<00:00:44.579> small

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
32 is just a smaller 51 and the small

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.020 
32 is just a smaller 51 and the small
fly<00:00:45.059> is<00:00:45.120> kind<00:00:45.600> of<00:00:45.750> a<00:00:45.870> smaller<00:00:46.489> spider<00:00:47.489> fly<00:00:47.789> but

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
fly is kind of a smaller spider fly but

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.959 
fly is kind of a smaller spider fly but
I<00:00:48.059> think<00:00:48.329> it<00:00:48.450> is<00:00:48.600> very<00:00:48.870> unique<00:00:49.969> there's

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
I think it is very unique there's

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.819 
I think it is very unique there's
nothing<00:00:51.390> like<00:00:51.539> it<00:00:51.600> really<00:00:51.960> out<00:00:52.199> there<00:00:52.440> I<00:00:52.500> think

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
nothing like it really out there I think

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:53.959 
nothing like it really out there I think
it's<00:00:52.920> a<00:00:53.010> better<00:00:53.160> flipper

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
it's a better flipper

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.720 
it's a better flipper
I<00:00:54.000> like<00:00:54.870> the<00:00:54.989> pocket<00:00:55.379> clip<00:00:55.530> better<00:00:55.829> it's<00:00:56.489> got<00:00:56.699> a

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
I like the pocket clip better it's got a

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.939 
I like the pocket clip better it's got a
spring<00:00:57.000> latch<00:00:57.270> that<00:00:57.300> I<00:00:58.050> think<00:00:58.590> is<00:00:58.739> a<00:00:58.770> little

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
spring latch that I think is a little

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.130 
spring latch that I think is a little
bit<00:00:59.160> cooler<00:00:59.579> just<00:01:00.149> because<00:01:00.480> it's<00:01:00.660> way<00:01:00.870> more

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
bit cooler just because it's way more

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.020 
bit cooler just because it's way more
out<00:01:01.170> of<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.440> way<00:01:01.469> than<00:01:01.800> the<00:01:01.920> 32<00:01:02.370> and<00:01:02.640> since<00:01:02.910> the

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
out of the way than the 32 and since the

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.740 
out of the way than the 32 and since the
32<00:01:03.420> is<00:01:03.539> such<00:01:03.719> a<00:01:03.750> small<00:01:04.049> Bali<00:01:05.180> the<00:01:06.180> latch<00:01:06.360> that

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
32 is such a small Bali the latch that

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.120 
32 is such a small Bali the latch that
yet<00:01:07.080> it<00:01:07.229> is<00:01:07.409> a<00:01:07.439> spring

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
yet it is a spring

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.960 
yet it is a spring
it<00:01:08.460> also<00:01:08.670> has<00:01:08.970> T<00:01:09.420> latch<00:01:09.960> like<00:01:10.490> features<00:01:11.490> so<00:01:11.760> it

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
it also has T latch like features so it

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.580 
it also has T latch like features so it
does<00:01:12.180> get<00:01:12.390> stuck<00:01:12.600> in<00:01:12.780> your<00:01:12.810> hand<00:01:13.049> a<00:01:13.200> little<00:01:13.229> bit

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
does get stuck in your hand a little bit

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.160 
does get stuck in your hand a little bit
well<00:01:13.770> flipping<00:01:14.299> so<00:01:15.299> I<00:01:15.330> do<00:01:15.450> like<00:01:15.780> the<00:01:15.960> small

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
well flipping so I do like the small

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.929 
well flipping so I do like the small
flies<00:01:16.439> latch<00:01:16.710> a<00:01:16.890> little<00:01:17.100> bit<00:01:17.220> more<00:01:17.430> I<00:01:17.640> think

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
flies latch a little bit more I think

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.740 
flies latch a little bit more I think
the<00:01:18.299> 32s<00:01:18.810> latch<00:01:19.049> is<00:01:19.439> far<00:01:20.130> more<00:01:20.340> innovative

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:20.750 
the 32s latch is far more innovative

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.990 
the 32s latch is far more innovative
obviously<00:01:21.750> it<00:01:21.869> is<00:01:22.130> but<00:01:23.130> I<00:01:23.159> do<00:01:23.280> like<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:23.850> way

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
obviously it is but I do like the way

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.270 
obviously it is but I do like the way
this<00:01:24.210> functions<00:01:24.689> a<00:01:24.780> little<00:01:24.900> bit<00:01:25.140> better<00:01:25.320> love

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
this functions a little bit better love

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.969 
this functions a little bit better love
the<00:01:26.430> blade<00:01:26.610> shape<00:01:26.909> I<00:01:27.210> like<00:01:27.600> 154cm<00:01:28.259> better<00:01:28.799> than

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
the blade shape I like 154cm better than

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.030 
the blade shape I like 154cm better than
d2<00:01:29.329> I<00:01:30.329> think<00:01:30.930> it's<00:01:31.079> just<00:01:31.259> a<00:01:31.350> really<00:01:31.380> really

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
d2 I think it's just a really really

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.740 
d2 I think it's just a really really
sick<00:01:32.310> knife<00:01:32.549> I<00:01:32.759> like<00:01:32.939> the<00:01:33.060> finish<00:01:33.390> on<00:01:33.600> it

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
sick knife I like the finish on it

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.800 
sick knife I like the finish on it
better<00:01:33.930> at<00:01:34.860> least<00:01:35.100> for<00:01:35.250> the<00:01:35.310> blade<00:01:35.549> the<00:01:36.119> 32<00:01:36.600> is

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
better at least for the blade the 32 is

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.260 
better at least for the blade the 32 is
totally<00:01:37.229> respectable<00:01:37.770> it's<00:01:38.130> a<00:01:38.400> very<00:01:38.880> close

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
totally respectable it's a very close

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.749 
totally respectable it's a very close
second<00:01:39.810> even<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:40.860> home<00:01:41.040> and<00:01:41.220> they<00:01:41.340> have<00:01:41.490> two

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
second even the home and they have two

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.810 
second even the home and they have two
different<00:01:41.939> types<00:01:42.360> of<00:01:42.540> small<00:01:42.750> valleys<00:01:43.200> I<00:01:44.100> guess

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
different types of small valleys I guess

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.080 
different types of small valleys I guess
you<00:01:44.939> can<00:01:45.119> kind<00:01:45.329> of<00:01:45.479> you<00:01:46.439> kind<00:01:46.829> of<00:01:46.920> fit<00:01:47.130> the<00:01:47.159> 53

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
you can kind of you kind of fit the 53

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.730 
you can kind of you kind of fit the 53
in<00:01:48.180> there<00:01:48.390> as<00:01:48.509> well<00:01:48.659> but<00:01:49.110> that<00:01:49.229> one's<00:01:49.409> just<00:01:49.470> in

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
in there as well but that one's just in

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.889 
in there as well but that one's just in
its<00:01:49.860> own<00:01:50.040> class<00:01:50.329> there's<00:01:51.329> some<00:01:51.479> one<00:01:51.600> kind<00:01:51.810> of

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
its own class there's some one kind of

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:55.880 
its own class there's some one kind of
name<00:01:52.110> class<00:01:53.780> but<00:01:54.780> yeah<00:01:54.930> the<00:01:55.170> small<00:01:55.619> fly<00:01:55.860> I

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
name class but yeah the small fly I

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.560 
name class but yeah the small fly I
think<00:01:56.310> is<00:01:56.399> definitely<00:01:56.579> the<00:01:56.969> better<00:01:57.149> way<00:01:57.360> to<00:01:57.390> go

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
think is definitely the better way to go

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.399 
think is definitely the better way to go
but<00:01:58.820> you<00:01:59.820> know<00:01:59.939> if<00:02:00.090> it's<00:02:00.630> really<00:02:00.960> coming<00:02:01.229> down

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
but you know if it's really coming down

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:05.090 
but you know if it's really coming down
to<00:02:02.390> which<00:02:03.390> one<00:02:03.600> flips<00:02:03.899> better<00:02:04.140> then<00:02:04.409> I<00:02:04.680> would

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
to which one flips better then I would

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.560 
to which one flips better then I would
have<00:02:05.219> to<00:02:05.369> go<00:02:05.490> for<00:02:05.670> the<00:02:05.729> small<00:02:06.000> fly<00:02:06.270> but<00:02:06.509> if

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
have to go for the small fly but if

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.419 
have to go for the small fly but if
you're<00:02:06.719> looking<00:02:06.990> for<00:02:07.170> just<00:02:07.350> a<00:02:07.500> unique<00:02:07.890> or

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
you're looking for just a unique or

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.400 
you're looking for just a unique or
sorry<00:02:09.000> just<00:02:09.179> a<00:02:09.270> cool<00:02:09.479> valley<00:02:09.750> one<00:02:10.080> that<00:02:10.289> you

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
sorry just a cool valley one that you

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.110 
sorry just a cool valley one that you
like<00:02:10.619> the<00:02:10.770> looks<00:02:11.009> of<00:02:11.220> which<00:02:11.489> also<00:02:11.700> flips<00:02:12.090> good

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
like the looks of which also flips good

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.449 
like the looks of which also flips good
since<00:02:13.480> these<00:02:13.660> do<00:02:13.870> flip<00:02:14.200> pretty<00:02:14.680> close<00:02:15.099> to<00:02:15.340> each

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:15.459 
since these do flip pretty close to each

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:17.550 
since these do flip pretty close to each
other<00:02:15.610> some<00:02:16.090> may<00:02:16.239> argue<00:02:16.390> the<00:02:16.750> 32<00:02:17.170> actually

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
other some may argue the 32 actually

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.320 
other some may argue the 32 actually
does<00:02:17.739> flip<00:02:17.950> better<00:02:18.190> I've<00:02:18.790> heard<00:02:19.090> a<00:02:19.120> lot<00:02:19.300> of

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
does flip better I've heard a lot of

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:20.820 
does flip better I've heard a lot of
people<00:02:19.480> say<00:02:19.780> the<00:02:19.840> small<00:02:20.110> fly<00:02:20.319> flips<00:02:20.590> better

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
people say the small fly flips better

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:23.910 
people say the small fly flips better
but<00:02:21.519> if<00:02:22.360> you're<00:02:22.660> really<00:02:22.930> not<00:02:23.050> an<00:02:23.230> experienced

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
but if you're really not an experienced

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.280 
but if you're really not an experienced
flipper<00:02:24.430> and<00:02:24.640> you're<00:02:24.760> not<00:02:24.910> looking<00:02:25.330> for<00:02:25.599> the

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
flipper and you're not looking for the

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:29.190 
flipper and you're not looking for the
best<00:02:26.650> small<00:02:27.220> flipper<00:02:27.849> out<00:02:28.090> there<00:02:28.390> that's

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
best small flipper out there that's

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.830 
best small flipper out there that's
readily<00:02:29.920> available<00:02:30.330> then<00:02:31.330> just<00:02:31.510> go<00:02:31.599> with<00:02:31.720> the

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
readily available then just go with the

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.080 
readily available then just go with the
one<00:02:31.989> that<00:02:32.019> looks<00:02:32.470> the<00:02:32.650> best<00:02:32.680> to<00:02:33.129> you<00:02:33.280> I<00:02:33.519> mean

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
one that looks the best to you I mean

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.030 
one that looks the best to you I mean
I'm<00:02:34.330> sure<00:02:34.390> a<00:02:34.599> lot<00:02:34.870> of<00:02:34.900> people<00:02:35.080> love<00:02:35.440> the<00:02:35.590> 32

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
I'm sure a lot of people love the 32

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.750 
I'm sure a lot of people love the 32
over<00:02:36.430> the<00:02:37.110> small<00:02:38.110> fly<00:02:38.349> anyway<00:02:38.739> so<00:02:38.799> I<00:02:39.250> say<00:02:39.489> go

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
over the small fly anyway so I say go

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.509 
over the small fly anyway so I say go
for<00:02:39.790> the<00:02:40.120> one<00:02:40.299> that<00:02:40.330> looks<00:02:40.720> better<00:02:40.989> for<00:02:41.290> you

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:41.519 
for the one that looks better for you

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:43.949 
for the one that looks better for you
maybe<00:02:42.519> the<00:02:42.610> one<00:02:42.819> that's<00:02:43.000> cheaper<00:02:43.209> as<00:02:43.450> well

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:43.959 
maybe the one that's cheaper as well

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:46.770 
maybe the one that's cheaper as well
if<00:02:44.470> you're<00:02:44.920> on<00:02:45.069> a<00:02:45.099> budget<00:02:45.310> and<00:02:45.760> I'm<00:02:46.569> not

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
if you're on a budget and I'm not

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.839 
if you're on a budget and I'm not
actually<00:02:46.959> sure<00:02:47.140> the<00:02:47.680> prices<00:02:48.099> of<00:02:48.220> both<00:02:48.400> I<00:02:48.700> got

00:02:48.839 --> 00:02:48.849 
actually sure the prices of both I got

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:52.830 
actually sure the prices of both I got
this<00:02:49.000> one<00:02:49.239> for<00:02:49.420> 129<00:02:49.959> at<00:02:50.319> blade<00:02:50.560> HQ<00:02:51.069> and<00:02:51.840> I

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
this one for 129 at blade HQ and I

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.160 
this one for 129 at blade HQ and I
believe<00:02:53.739> that<00:02:53.769> is<00:02:54.160> cheaper<00:02:54.760> than<00:02:54.790> than<00:02:55.569> the<00:02:55.720> 32

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
believe that is cheaper than than the 32

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.789 
believe that is cheaper than than the 32
in<00:02:56.530> most<00:02:56.829> places<00:02:57.010> I<00:02:57.459> know<00:02:58.299> the<00:02:58.540> 32<00:02:58.959> and<00:02:58.989> 51<00:02:59.560> have

00:02:59.789 --> 00:02:59.799 
in most places I know the 32 and 51 have

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:01.619 
in most places I know the 32 and 51 have
dropped<00:03:00.099> in<00:03:00.280> price<00:03:00.310> significantly<00:03:00.700> since

00:03:01.619 --> 00:03:01.629 
dropped in price significantly since

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:03.930 
dropped in price significantly since
they<00:03:01.840> came<00:03:02.049> out<00:03:02.260> I<00:03:02.560> hate<00:03:03.129> to<00:03:03.310> say<00:03:03.489> it<00:03:03.670> but<00:03:03.910> I

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
they came out I hate to say it but I

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.869 
they came out I hate to say it but I
spent<00:03:04.390> over<00:03:05.290> 200<00:03:05.860> bucks<00:03:06.040> for<00:03:06.250> this<00:03:06.370> guy<00:03:06.579> since

00:03:06.869 --> 00:03:06.879 
spent over 200 bucks for this guy since

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:08.699 
spent over 200 bucks for this guy since
I<00:03:07.120> am<00:03:07.329> Canadian<00:03:07.870> I<00:03:07.959> had<00:03:08.079> to<00:03:08.170> buy<00:03:08.319> it<00:03:08.349> at<00:03:08.560> retail

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:08.709 
I am Canadian I had to buy it at retail

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:11.670 
I am Canadian I had to buy it at retail
and<00:03:09.190> I<00:03:09.879> did<00:03:10.090> buy<00:03:10.239> this<00:03:10.299> one<00:03:10.660> for<00:03:10.690> just<00:03:11.349> about

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
and I did buy this one for just about

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.470 
and I did buy this one for just about
200<00:03:12.190> bucks<00:03:12.340> I<00:03:12.640> believe<00:03:12.940> you<00:03:13.090> could<00:03:13.209> probably

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
200 bucks I believe you could probably

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.250 
200 bucks I believe you could probably
get<00:03:13.810> this<00:03:13.989> for<00:03:14.730> 130<00:03:15.730> 140<00:03:16.239> this<00:03:16.629> one<00:03:16.840> as<00:03:17.019> well<00:03:17.230> I

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
get this for 130 140 this one as well I

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.740 
get this for 130 140 this one as well I
believe<00:03:17.560> one<00:03:17.889> 30<00:03:18.160> or<00:03:18.310> 40<00:03:18.609> so<00:03:18.850> they're<00:03:19.540> both

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 
believe one 30 or 40 so they're both

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:22.410 
believe one 30 or 40 so they're both
very<00:03:20.049> similar<00:03:20.560> in<00:03:20.680> price<00:03:20.950> they<00:03:21.819> flip<00:03:22.150> both

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420 
very similar in price they flip both

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:25.140 
very similar in price they flip both
pretty<00:03:22.840> similarly<00:03:23.440> I<00:03:23.799> would<00:03:24.489> have<00:03:24.670> to<00:03:24.940> give

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.150 
pretty similarly I would have to give

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:27.210 
pretty similarly I would have to give
the<00:03:25.720> better<00:03:25.900> flipper<00:03:26.290> definitely<00:03:27.010> to<00:03:27.130> the

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:27.220 
the better flipper definitely to the

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:29.879 
the better flipper definitely to the
small<00:03:27.519> fly<00:03:27.760> in<00:03:27.940> my<00:03:28.090> opinion<00:03:28.599> I'd<00:03:29.319> have<00:03:29.560> to<00:03:29.709> give

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:29.889 
small fly in my opinion I'd have to give

00:03:29.889 --> 00:03:32.309 
small fly in my opinion I'd have to give
it<00:03:30.220> a<00:03:30.459> small<00:03:30.760> fly<00:03:31.060> the<00:03:31.120> uniqueness<00:03:31.959> and

00:03:32.309 --> 00:03:32.319 
it a small fly the uniqueness and

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:34.830 
it a small fly the uniqueness and
coolness<00:03:32.590> factor<00:03:33.010> it's<00:03:33.970> just<00:03:34.239> in<00:03:34.359> a<00:03:34.420> class<00:03:34.630> of

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 
coolness factor it's just in a class of

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.150 
coolness factor it's just in a class of
its<00:03:34.959> own<00:03:35.139> and<00:03:35.349> I<00:03:35.440> think<00:03:35.470> it's<00:03:35.829> it's<00:03:36.069> really

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:36.160 
its own and I think it's it's really

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:39.479 
its own and I think it's it's really
cool<00:03:36.609> so<00:03:36.970> I<00:03:37.180> say<00:03:37.959> go<00:03:38.590> for<00:03:38.799> the<00:03:38.829> small<00:03:39.160> fly

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:39.489 
cool so I say go for the small fly

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:41.729 
cool so I say go for the small fly
because<00:03:40.060> it's<00:03:40.299> also<00:03:40.510> quite<00:03:41.139> a<00:03:41.170> bit<00:03:41.349> more<00:03:41.500> rare

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:41.739 
because it's also quite a bit more rare

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:43.080 
because it's also quite a bit more rare
and<00:03:41.950> they<00:03:42.040> would<00:03:42.190> just<00:03:42.370> continue<00:03:42.790> for<00:03:43.000> a<00:03:43.030> while

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:43.090 
and they would just continue for a while

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:44.610 
and they would just continue for a while
and<00:03:43.419> I<00:03:43.540> don't<00:03:43.599> know<00:03:43.780> how<00:03:43.930> long<00:03:44.139> they'll<00:03:44.349> still

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:44.620 
and I don't know how long they'll still

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:46.080 
and I don't know how long they'll still
be<00:03:44.650> around<00:03:44.799> I<00:03:45.190> don't<00:03:45.250> even<00:03:45.459> know<00:03:45.730> if<00:03:45.880> they're

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.090 
be around I don't even know if they're

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:48.030 
be around I don't even know if they're
producing<00:03:47.049> anymore<00:03:47.470> they<00:03:47.620> might<00:03:47.769> just<00:03:47.950> be

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.040 
producing anymore they might just be

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:49.379 
producing anymore they might just be
getting<00:03:48.370> rid<00:03:48.489> of<00:03:48.549> the<00:03:48.730> ones<00:03:48.910> that<00:03:49.120> they<00:03:49.209> have

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:49.389 
getting rid of the ones that they have

00:03:49.389 --> 00:03:54.479 
getting rid of the ones that they have
left<00:03:51.030> but<00:03:52.030> yeah<00:03:52.919> small<00:03:53.919> fly

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:54.489 
left but yeah small fly

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:58.860 
left but yeah small fly
