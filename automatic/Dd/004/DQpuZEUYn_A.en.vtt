00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:13.560
 [music] 

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:24.550
 hello dear friends with you nekit 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.290
 hangar and in this issue I will answer all 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:28.689
 the questions you asked me in the group 

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:30.699
 used to and of course the first of these was 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:32.920
 the question is when on android or rather 

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:35.019
 when already forgotten and according to the latest data and 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:37.269
 I can say that, on android promised 

00:00:35.019 --> 00:00:39.489
 immediately after the release on ios i.e. it is 

00:00:37.269 --> 00:00:41.530
 will be somewhere in the middle of September that 

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:43.780
 As for the release of the game, then by mine 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:46.089
 assumption and calculations she will see 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:47.640
 November-December of this year but not in 

00:00:46.089 --> 00:00:50.350
 the fifteenth year that's for sure 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.120
 the next question saw that all of ours 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:54.400
 Soviet tanks high really yard 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:56.890
 the sapps festival so awful it 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:59.049
 it is this i answer no no i think so 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:00.430
 scoops better nation in this game is something 

00:00:59.049 --> 00:01:02.589
 so from so what pt 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:04.540
 all branches are great so only then 

00:01:02.589 --> 00:01:06.580
 achieve Soviet tanks or just them 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:08.830
 hate either just can't again on 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:10.420
 this nation why are you all the time cottage 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:12.850
 divorced from the same tanks on which 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:14.950
 weighing first balance second I want 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:17.500
 show how people play on the fact that someone 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:19.960
 will you do the same sneakers ? 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.590
 reviews on other nations of course I will where 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.470
 I go 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:26.290
 what server do you play in russian 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:28.750
 how about crashes the game crashed with me 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:31.090
 by 11 every 30 50 battles 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:33.370
 they are very often so i'm not complaining 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:34.150
 what do you think about increasing fights 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:36.010
 in 10 minutes 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:38.020
 how much do I know the tasks for 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:39.550
 increase the time of battle 5 developers 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.710
 not standing yet since zbt 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:43.000
 as cards are small games about one thing 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:44.920
 the battle is also not so much 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.830
 by the way if anyone noticed something for everyone 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:49.930
 the card has a different battle time set 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:52.000
 you think about art here my opinion 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:54.220
 divided into two parts on one side 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.590
 reviews new tanks the other side i 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:59.110
 always hate and hated the enemy 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:00.880
 artillery plus everything still even 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:03.220
 in large tanks and and can not normally 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.810
 balance what do you think about 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:07.340
 card extensions recently released 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:09.590
 update 12 in which you can 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.989
 play on the most fresh and sandy 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.430
 map hot sands which are more on 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:17.209
 compared to other cards approximately 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:18.800
 one and a half times and this is good as thinking 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:21.349
 how does a mouse yes it can I say 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:23.180
 confidently up the developers and said that 

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:26.630

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:29.269
 just such as from 4 mouse 140 object 2 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:31.130
 3 and so on and only then they 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:33.680
 will begin to think about timba naguchu them 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:36.920
 183 wafer type machines 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:39.380

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:45.080

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:49.220
 but planned when the tank is in the bushes 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:51.410
 who is harder to notice 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:54.680
 yes bushes noticeably increases disguise 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:56.510

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.310

 whether we will enter your close beer sport 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:09.440
 I'm 80 percent sure that it will come in 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:11.090
 as a battle mode, it's too much like 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:13.790
