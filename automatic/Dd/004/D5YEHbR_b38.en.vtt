 has the advantage that a very low 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:46.360
 weight has a tremendous heat performance 

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:48.070
 and a very small pack size one 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:50.470
 ideal example for a thumb 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:52.960
 Sleeping bag is here our sundowner us 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:56.070

 even when wet was isolated 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:10.659
 the one in tune is very sturdy and 

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:12.280
 especially easily satisfied here by jack

 modeled on the human body 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:24.130
 and thus optimally stores the heat 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.700
 Sleeping bags are available in different 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:29.530

 the most important question you ask yourself 

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:38.259
 user should ask if you in the 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:40.450
 Holiday drives is what temperatures 

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:42.420

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:45.159
 temperature ranges our sleeping bags 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.670
 be on the heat scale right on the 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:50.399
 Product explains the comfort area 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.990

00:01:56.259 --> 00:02:00.219
 minus zero degrees of orientation value 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.869
 for the men lies between the 

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:03.869
 comfort area and in the area 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:08.880
 all jack wolfskin sleeping bags are after 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.500
 The thermal sound technology is designed 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.720
 that means they have one 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.570
 People who are sensitive to cold are the ones on the head 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.060
 and torso and all feet especially good 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:19.290
 are fed 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.240
 In conclusion, one can say that 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.580
 the user should be aware of it 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:25.740
 so should use for the sleeping bag 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:28.050
 would like in what temperature ranges 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:29.400
 is at night then has close 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:31.050
 to make the decision 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:34.700
 I choose a thumbsleeve or sleeping bag 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:34.700
 a synthetic fiber sleeping bag
