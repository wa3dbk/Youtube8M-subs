00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:09.300
 hello welcome to the mini creations in 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.190
 the series built minecraft small 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.500
 objects that serve as decoration 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.269
 to bring small details in buildings or 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.609
 just give you new ideas 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:21.270
 This is about this little one 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:23.070
 sailboats in this box you see the 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.600
 the building materials he needs for it now 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:29.519
 I'll show you how to sail the sailboat 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:31.590
 builds best in the same water as 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:37.590
 First we build up to 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:41.070
 water surface high and five farmers 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:44.730
 blocks in the meadow below the 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:47.969
 water surface then we do one 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.219
 then stairs towards a staircase 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.820
 up 

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:52.820
 and 26 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:01:07.979
 here is a sap facing up even 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:14.450
 stairs once around then then still behind 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:17.810
 a slip on it that the basic construction 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.810
 then here 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.710
 Build 15 higher 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:27.060
 have broken through 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.590
 so 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:33.770
 here a fence there a bit 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.770
 stand out 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:41.880
 moment backward hits 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:51.100
 so maybe that is better so is better 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.320
 exactly 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:57.420
 here you can go and make fans in 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:57.420
 open up for decor 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.280
 here then 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.360
 so once 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.090
 Where 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:12.320
 so that's the goal too 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:23.240
 looks good 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.240
 a little wind 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.220
 use annually 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:43.120
 make like robs when I get one out 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:46.209
 so and that is the sailboat thanks for 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:49.660
 I'm watching semi until the next one 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:51.209
 I think it would be better for mine 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:54.510
 would make away 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:54.510
 the collar 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:03.310
 huge boat 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:03.310
 O
