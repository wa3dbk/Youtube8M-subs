00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:06.600
 3 princess 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:09.410
 today friends are the creators of the new film 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:13.469
 fnaf posted on facebook 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:16.100
 new shot from his movie and now we 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:19.170
 we will carefully consider this frame 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:21.300
 sure friends put likes if 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.130
 want to see more videos on this game 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.560
 and let's get started 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.619
 just yesterday told you about 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.949
 multiple shots from a new movie like 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.820
 iron horse company today 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:36.329
 published on its official 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:39.390
 Facebook page is new and very 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:42.960
 An interesting shot of the past video told 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:46.289
 that the film will be foxy however 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:49.170
 iron horse company and sew all surprise 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:52.170
 and we will see films also 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:55.620
 a sprint park which judging by the image 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:58.710
 going to the forest I want to note that on 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:01.710
 In this screenshot, you also see smoke and 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.969
 fire therefore there is an option that burned 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.330
 not a pizzeria 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:09.479
 and horror attraction is therefore possible that 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:12.330
 in the film we will see events that 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:16.020
 occurred after the third part of the fnaf and 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:18.570
 if so it will be very cool in 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:21.509
 General, let's see what awaits in this 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.409
 great movie for now it's mine 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.920
 assumption 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.640
 besides, as far as we know throughout 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.189
 fnaf series 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:33.630
 there was only one fire that happened 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:36.900
 exactly the horror attraction like in the game so 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:40.860
 and in the new film the sprintrap survived like this 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:43.400
 he goes to c1 then it seems that the other 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.940
 animatronics remained inside 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:49.190
 and perhaps to the mouth managed to get out 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:51.800
 In general, for all these frames you can 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:52.430
 suggest a rough story new 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:55.070
 the movie 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:57.740
 at first you will see how horror is tanned 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.850
 the attraction runs out of it sprint and 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.400
 goes to the forest 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:05.300
 now in the forest itself and will occur 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:06.140
 main action of the new film ask 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:08.810
 why 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:11.600
 and the thing is that if you need to do 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:14.390
 scenery for pizzeria or attraction 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:17.209
 to make it look like a game it is very and 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.020
 a very long time and since the new film will be released 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:21.020
 soon 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:23.720
 then people from the iron horse company decided 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:25.880
 make everything easier and if the main 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.490
 the action of the film will really 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:30.830
 happen forest and sprints for example 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:31.640
 will hunt the forest campers 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:34.730
 of tourists 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.990
 then it will be really interesting and 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:38.959
 original 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:40.790
 because as we know animatronics never 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:44.270
 not outside 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:47.150
 if airforce really 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:50.600
 came up with so it promises to be 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:54.260
 interesting but maybe they came up 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:57.500
 something more original and better 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:59.900
 for now it's just speculation to that 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:02.480
 how do you remember the first part of the movie 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:04.910
 they filmed in their warehouse 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:07.280
 so no decorations and no beats 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:09.920
 had to and this means that it is quite 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:13.220
 it is possible that they will continue the film 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:15.980
 I will shoot the wheel I hope you release 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:18.590
 like and be sure to write what you 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:22.010
