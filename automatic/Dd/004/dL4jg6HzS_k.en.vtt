 master personally walter rogg 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:16.039

 on the inner values ​​it depends 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:35.600
 both the long and the s 1 the 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:38.960
 question is of course how it is more content 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:40.550
 from the car so you always have yourself 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.379
 the feeling that you do not get older than

 just 25 years old but if you want the 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:56.089
 possibility would be my hinges 

00:00:54.799 --> 00:01:00.290
 to watch then they would also be 

00:00:56.089 --> 00:01:02.420
 that she is very well located

 bulky beauty of the s1 and its 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:11.540
 ingenious for that time 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.430
