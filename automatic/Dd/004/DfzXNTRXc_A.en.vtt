hi this is a review of the frying
stainless<00:00:15.059> steel<00:00:15.330> French<00:00:15.719> press<00:00:16.020> now<00:00:16.680> you<00:00:16.740> may

stainless steel French press now you may

00:00:17.009 --> 00:00:18.950 
stainless steel French press now you may
be<00:00:17.039> asking<00:00:17.759> yourself<00:00:17.820> why<00:00:18.390> do<00:00:18.449> I<00:00:18.599> need<00:00:18.689> to<00:00:18.810> go

be asking yourself why do I need to go

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.900 
be asking yourself why do I need to go
out<00:00:19.080> and<00:00:19.200> buy<00:00:19.380> a<00:00:19.710> French<00:00:20.099> press<00:00:20.400> when<00:00:20.700> I<00:00:20.730> have<00:00:20.880> a

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
out and buy a French press when I have a

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.150 
out and buy a French press when I have a
perfectly<00:00:21.329> good<00:00:21.450> drip<00:00:22.349> coffee<00:00:22.619> system<00:00:23.039> at

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
perfectly good drip coffee system at

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.850 
perfectly good drip coffee system at
home<00:00:23.310> well<00:00:23.820> tell<00:00:24.090> you<00:00:24.210> this<00:00:24.390> the<00:00:25.289> French<00:00:25.560> press

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:25.860 
home well tell you this the French press

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:28.429 
home well tell you this the French press
will<00:00:26.099> make<00:00:26.279> a<00:00:26.520> much<00:00:26.849> more<00:00:27.150> flavorful<00:00:27.750> cup<00:00:28.290> of

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
will make a much more flavorful cup of

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.019 
will make a much more flavorful cup of
coffee<00:00:28.680> than<00:00:29.009> your<00:00:29.130> traditional<00:00:29.279> drip<00:00:29.790> and

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
coffee than your traditional drip and

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.909 
coffee than your traditional drip and
that's<00:00:30.509> because<00:00:30.899> of<00:00:31.020> the<00:00:31.169> process<00:00:31.680> is

00:00:31.909 --> 00:00:31.919 
that's because of the process is

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:33.889 
that's because of the process is
uniquely<00:00:32.489> different<00:00:32.759> from<00:00:33.000> a<00:00:33.239> drip<00:00:33.480> system

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
uniquely different from a drip system

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.590 
uniquely different from a drip system
the<00:00:34.590> way<00:00:34.770> that<00:00:34.800> a<00:00:35.010> French<00:00:35.280> press<00:00:35.489> works<00:00:35.879> is

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
the way that a French press works is

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.990 
the way that a French press works is
that<00:00:36.870> you<00:00:37.110> put<00:00:37.410> your<00:00:37.620> coffee<00:00:37.950> grounds<00:00:38.640> and

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
that you put your coffee grounds and

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.709 
that you put your coffee grounds and
your<00:00:39.420> hot<00:00:39.629> water<00:00:39.899> inside<00:00:40.800> the<00:00:41.280> press<00:00:41.550> you<00:00:42.420> let

about four to five minutes then after

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:49.970 
about four to five minutes then after
four<00:00:49.230> to<00:00:49.289> five<00:00:49.409> minutes<00:00:49.559> you're<00:00:49.739> going<00:00:49.829> to<00:00:49.890> be

four to five minutes allows the coffee

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.490 
four to five minutes allows the coffee
flavor<00:01:13.680> and<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:14.010> essential<00:01:14.400> oils<00:01:14.909> to<00:01:15.720> blend

flavor and the essential oils to blend

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.320 
flavor and the essential oils to blend
with<00:01:16.800> the<00:01:16.920> water<00:01:17.160> more<00:01:17.490> so<00:01:17.790> than<00:01:18.000> with<00:01:18.150> your

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
with the water more so than with your

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:19.970 
with the water more so than with your
traditional<00:01:18.780> paper<00:01:19.050> filter<00:01:19.470> which<00:01:19.650> is<00:01:19.770> much

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:19.980 
traditional paper filter which is much

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:20.960 
traditional paper filter which is much
finer<00:01:20.250> entraps

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
finer entraps

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.230 
finer entraps
some<00:01:21.330> of<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.570> oils<00:01:21.990> and<00:01:22.230> the<00:01:22.410> coffee<00:01:22.620> flavor

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:23.240 
some of the oils and the coffee flavor

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.430 
some of the oils and the coffee flavor
so<00:01:24.240> we're<00:01:24.360> going<00:01:24.450> to<00:01:24.540> move<00:01:24.660> on<00:01:24.840> to<00:01:25.170> the

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:25.440 
so we're going to move on to the

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:27.590 
so we're going to move on to the
benefits<00:01:26.160> of<00:01:26.370> this<00:01:26.610> particular<00:01:27.090> model<00:01:27.300> made

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
benefits of this particular model made

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.930 
benefits of this particular model made
by<00:01:27.630> frying<00:01:28.220> it's<00:01:29.220> made<00:01:29.490> out<00:01:29.640> of<00:01:29.670> stainless

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:29.940 
by frying it's made out of stainless

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:32.150 
by frying it's made out of stainless
steel<00:01:30.450> when<00:01:30.930> you<00:01:31.020> traditionally<00:01:31.800> think<00:01:31.920> of<00:01:32.040> a

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:32.160 
steel when you traditionally think of a

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:34.280 
steel when you traditionally think of a
French<00:01:32.370> press<00:01:32.580> you<00:01:32.760> think<00:01:32.970> of<00:01:33.150> the<00:01:33.690> French

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
French press you think of the French

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.790 
French press you think of the French
press<00:01:34.560> with<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:34.890> glass<00:01:35.160> container<00:01:36.200> I<00:01:37.200> seem<00:01:37.770> to

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:37.800 
press with the glass container I seem to

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.680 
press with the glass container I seem to
think<00:01:37.920> that<00:01:38.190> the<00:01:38.430> stainless<00:01:38.940> steel<00:01:38.970> model<00:01:39.420> is

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:39.690 
think that the stainless steel model is

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:42.920 
think that the stainless steel model is
superior<00:01:40.110> and<00:01:40.470> I'll<00:01:40.560> tell<00:01:40.800> you<00:01:40.920> why<00:01:41.630> it<00:01:42.630> has<00:01:42.900> a

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
superior and I'll tell you why it has a

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.390 
superior and I'll tell you why it has a
double<00:01:43.740> walled<00:01:43.980> stainless<00:01:44.700> steel<00:01:45.000> exterior

it's polished on the outside nice polish

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:50.870 
it's polished on the outside nice polish
Sheen<00:01:50.040> which<00:01:50.250> makes<00:01:50.490> it<00:01:50.610> very<00:01:50.730> attractive

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880

I<00:02:19.290> think<00:02:20.290> this<00:02:20.500> is<00:02:20.680> probably<00:02:21.070> the<00:02:21.310> best<00:02:21.720> French

the manufacturer directions and they

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:27.600 
the manufacturer directions and they
said<00:03:26.019> that<00:03:26.170> you<00:03:26.380> could<00:03:26.620> not<00:03:26.800> place<00:03:27.130> this<00:03:27.400> on

said that you could not place this on
the<00:03:27.760> stove<00:03:28.060> so<00:03:28.660> we<00:03:28.870> have<00:03:29.019> to<00:03:29.140> heat<00:03:29.350> our<00:03:29.500> water

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:03.340 
not good down the sink so you somehow

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:05.100 
not good down the sink so you somehow

most<00:04:08.890> efficient<00:04:09.430> way<00:04:09.519> to<00:04:09.549> do<00:04:09.880> this<00:04:10.120> is<00:04:10.810> to<00:04:11.019> use

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:11.170 
most efficient way to do this is to use

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:14.400 
most efficient way to do this is to use
a<00:04:11.200> strainer<00:04:11.680> it's<00:04:12.670> cheap<00:04:12.970> most

a strainer it's cheap most
