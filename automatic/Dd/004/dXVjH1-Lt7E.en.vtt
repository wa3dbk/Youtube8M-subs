place to go and that happened k sparta
racing<00:06:58.140> but<00:06:58.650> that's<00:06:58.680> I<00:06:59.010> think<00:06:59.070> if<00:06:59.850> we<00:07:00.060> start

00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:00.360 
racing but that's I think if we start

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:02.750 
racing but that's I think if we start
racing<00:07:00.870> like<00:07:01.200> that<00:07:01.380> you're<00:07:02.250> going<00:07:02.370> to<00:07:02.460> end<00:07:02.640> up

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:02.760 
racing like that you're going to end up

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:06.920 
racing like that you're going to end up
very<00:07:03.150> badly

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:06.930 

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:09.270 

this<00:07:07.930> is<00:07:08.080> how<00:07:08.200> it<00:07:08.320> looks<00:07:08.350> on<00:07:08.740> the<00:07:08.920> overall

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:09.280 
this is how it looks on the overall

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:11.730 
this is how it looks on the overall
leader<00:07:09.580> board<00:07:09.880> now<00:07:10.120> victory<00:07:11.020> one<00:07:11.200> building<00:07:11.680> a

the rest to stem the tide before it's
