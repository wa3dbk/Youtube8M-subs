00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:06.120
 heracles plays the first half in one 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.760
 352 type system with kangaskolkka and 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.590
 weghorst in the attack for what it's worth 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.090
 is because during training there is a 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.900
 class especially worked on the fit 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.540
 to become 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.279
 tactics will be discussed later is heart 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.660
 perhaps a nice experiment in the 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.160
 preparation for the new season this 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.680
 is paul each he finds 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.289
 weghorst for the goal in the rush hour 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.970
 came across from fc emmen scores immediately 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.990
 his fourth hit of these 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.429
 preparation is that 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.429
 club top scorer from heracles 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.300
 Gessi sent away on the left flank 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.450
 weghorst is completely back for the goal 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.760
 free and that neatly cut within 20 a 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.260
 couple van weghorst 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.090
 The statistics showed that Heracles 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.879
 last year scored very poorly on it 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.160
 part headers to improve them 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.030
 even purchased a special cup of gallows 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.050
 this week 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.770
 but who did wish it was apparently gone 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:58.260
 not necessary and this is also a headline goal 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:01.260
 now scored by aleksei kangaskolkka on 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.820
 indicate mike te wierik 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.049
 it is now after more than half an hour 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.049
 already 3 0 for heracles 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.729
 on new mike te wierik stitch purple 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.320
 to navratil that hang a bit 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.140
 dordrecht plays for the goal 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.930
 wout weghorst and he scores his second 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.030
 hat trick of this preparation 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.600
 point number 6 for the forward 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.600
 borne 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.850
 this appears to be a violation of the police 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.080
 good advantage given by maurice 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.240
 pair house 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.009
 Referees talent from bringing him under 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.220
 Heracles' attack continues and leads 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.810
 to meet menno heerkes son 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.810
 from former trainer gert heerkes 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.430
 he came over from heerenveen 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.970
 so put it on a 5 0 lead 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:47.939
 still in the first half again 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.890
 Workers wide around Jessey gets some 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:52.770
 space advances does that very nicely 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:55.220
 it finds jessie on the stroke of peace with the 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.220
 6 0 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:01.590
 and in the second half Jan brings the young 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.470
 a number of new players within the 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.860
 lines such as Thomas Bruns 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:06.860
 bas sibum 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.780
 wout weghorst has stopped laying the 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:14.819
 Get your pan ready for Daan Rienstra 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.500
 Ben Rienstra's young brother who is this one 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:19.230
 went to pec zwolle in the summer 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.950
 Daan has remained in Almelo scores 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.950
 here the 0 7 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:25.709
 then wout weghorst is still thanked 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:27.720
 for his proven services this afternoon 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:30.350
 he is relieved by osama bananas 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.350
 the point of the attack 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.140
 schiedam hit the ball not quite right 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:38.730
 that a possibility for sharma youtube 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.200
 but he does not score the point of honor 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.180
 the glider 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.430
 team that became champion in the 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:46.799
 Sunday 2nd class and year comes the atmosphere 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.299
 comes in first class but 

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:50.160
 heracles is clearly a buddy too 

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:51.930
 big certainly in the second half 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:56.040
 you eight zero Simon Cziommer on 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:57.480
 indicate osama bananas and allah too 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.190
 getting in is still the necessary opportunity 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.019
 in the second half in particular had to leave 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:04.500
 A few times bell Hassani got a tot 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:07.519
 of the possibility this despite state 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.519
 the counter is already at 8 

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:16.329
 pelupessy is going to be good 

00:03:13.719 --> 00:03:21.090
 opponent dana 

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:21.090
 how samana after 9 0 

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:26.200
 use this year at heracles all 

00:03:24.189 --> 00:03:27.969
 to the figure 10, said chairman Jan 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.459
 smit this week on the press day 

00:03:27.969 --> 00:03:33.219
 tenth year in a row in the Premier League and 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:34.750
 tenth place is the goal 

00:03:33.219 --> 00:03:36.819
 so viewers from there in 10 can 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:37.959
 against the float 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:39.129
 it is a possibility that exploited 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:41.379
 should not be linssen 

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:43.689
 selfish favors hit nutritious 

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:46.659
 channels and so heracles indeed wins 

00:03:43.689 --> 00:03:48.069
 with tino from the hover year 

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:49.659
 that finally very enjoyable a good 

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:51.939
 course and they train very hard 

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:53.859
 well that of course is always true 

00:03:51.939 --> 00:03:56.019
 in the preparation but it pleases very well 

00:03:53.859 --> 00:03:57.639
 well i think have a mix of van 

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:59.439
 it experienced players and also a lot 

00:03:57.639 --> 00:04:01.030
 young talents and 

00:03:59.439 --> 00:04:03.629
 yes i hope that's a nice one 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:03.629
 season
