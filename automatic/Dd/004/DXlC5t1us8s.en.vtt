 spotted this incident can hardly be explained as natural phenomena 

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:24.550

 What can the economy learn about the search for extraterrestrial life? 

00:07:04.269 --> 00:07:08.789
 Innovation and competitiveness regardless of how and where this search

 why did the Saudis have his interest in Opel

 the world art main supplier makes a decision 

00:07:50.719 --> 00:07:53.999
