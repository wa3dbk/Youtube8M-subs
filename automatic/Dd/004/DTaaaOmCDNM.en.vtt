00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.109
 and see a horror tape for many is 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:09.150
 a catharsis the power to redeem the casualties 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:12.599
 passions to see those projected in a 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:15.420
 tape without suffering a punishment others do not 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.640
 they scare but they get excited and there is the 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.369
 idea that viewers are happy to 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.680
 be unhappy , terror sells from Peru 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:26.300
 so we wonder why we 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:29.390
 they like these tapes so much 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:31.669
 the scenes of emotion the adrenaline what 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:33.949
 that feels half relaxed I 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:36.470
 I distract in the night as I feel 

00:00:33.949 --> 00:00:38.750
 is not what you've seen every time 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:41.300
 there appears an escrow of terror I come to see 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:45.040
 If one of them accomplishes his task, they alter me 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.040
 because they make me nervous 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:54.130
 so if we check the local card 

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:56.080
 we will see that every week there is a 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:58.420
 premiere of this genre covering from 

00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:00.550
 Hollywood blockbuster tapes with high 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.950
 budget until unknown 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:06.750
 productions that attract like flies to 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:06.750
 the avid fans of scares 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:12.010
 Peru is a special country in the world 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:13.960
 where more dogs are consumed than 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:15.310
 we believe that cinema consumption 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:17.650
 of terror of horror stories in 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:20.440
 reality is universal is transversal to 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:22.570
 all cultures from small since 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:23.680
 children we were subjugated trapped 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:25.150
 for these stories that nine 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:28.180
 discovered that there is no single 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:31.060
 Peruvian who has not had or properly 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:32.800
 is a close relative person a 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:34.810
 paranormal type experience 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.370
 just go to the movies to see one of these 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:38.680
 stories that can plug me in that 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:41.920
 it may look like the one I lived is very 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:43.600
 attractive and ppd and more attracts us the 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.970
 look before the presence of the devil in the 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:48.760
 land the souls that torment us of 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:51.250
 thousand endless sagas of 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:53.520
 paranormal phenomena cruel 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:56.560
 demonic possessions revenge 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:59.260
 from the beyond the vile and 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:02.229
 ruthless murderers in series and by 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:07.800
 supposed the fierce classic monsters 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:10.320
 and voracious and in all enjoying like crazy 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:12.270
 that is going to feel alive in the most 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:14.220
 primitive suddenly of feeling that you're 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:16.500
 I live maybe that's why there's so much 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.900
 renewal and there is so much fascination for 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:22.530
 that kind of cinema not something surprising 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.640
 spent this 2013 with almost 800 thousand 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.140
 spectators 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.540
 cemetery general of history mnh 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:29.400
 Fernández Monís showed that this cinema 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.470
 has a lot to offer in our 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:34.200
 industry becoming the movie 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:36.480
 of this genre most seen in the country in 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.580
 the last 10 years beating him 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:41.750
 blockbusters tapes like the saga of 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.750
 paranormal activity 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:47.730
 a genre that moved me a lot and 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:48.930
 this and has identified that 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.490
 commercially it had not worked 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:52.530
 still in movie theaters cinema 

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:54.630
 genre of horror genre in the country 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:57.180
 however the terror figures were 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:59.700
 amazing but this is not the only 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:02.460
 Peruvian horror film because film 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:04.110
 regional is the great pioneer and promoter 

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:07.020
 from gender terrifying the 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:09.690
 spectators of these zones tapes the 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:11.880
 south of the country whose directors project 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:14.760
 own beliefs and worldview 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:17.430
 of their culture unfortunately very few 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:19.530
 come to Lima because of its low demand and 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:21.880
 low budget with which the 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:23.320
 filmmakers 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.600
 normally one goes to the movies to be 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:28.150
 moved to be removed and we are a 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:29.630
 society that wants to feel more than 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:32.360
 reflect 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:34.610
 and the horror movies that make you feel 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:36.890
 it does not seem sane that so many people 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:40.430
 submerge voluntarily in almost two 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:42.980
 hours of disgust and scares but the 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:45.560
 adrenaline that causes the distraction of 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:48.290
 the mundane life and the voyeuristic enjoyment of 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:51.470
 see how horrible they safely lead to 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:53.210
 the Peruvians to see them and to you what is it 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:55.360
 what do you like most about movies 

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:55.360
 terror
