00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.449
 continuing the project we saw in the 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:05.279
 previous video 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:08.460
 in this video here we will learn to 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:10.410
 insert in a lift as you insert a 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.440
 in the project that we have up to 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:16.199
 now this I have some levels here 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.390
 in which I copied the contents of a level 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:21.570
 for all the others and now they want to be 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:24.810
 An elevator for this I come here to 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:27.449
 Level 1 and let's say the elevator goes 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.830
 located in any position 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.740
 This is not going to make a difference to me. 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:34.020
 I will not I will not draw the walls I will 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.070
 let it loose here let's say I 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.180
 I'm going to have a lift 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:41.040
 There is here so the elevator will stay pro 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.710
 I'm going to make it here for the 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.850
 outside just to exemplify 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.700
 so how do I insert 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:50.070
 lift the lift it is actually a 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.510
 component here comes a component 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.610
 insert a component 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.969
 Only the elevator is not in my room. 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:59.699
 standard list of components 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.420
 I have to carry the family of the 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.409
 elevator 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:06.000
 so come here to carry family 

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:09.450
 I have family equipment 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.430
 special lifts and cranes 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.520
 I am from Brazil and I have one 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:17.690
 lift a complete lift model 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:20.270
 I come here to open 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:22.070
 and then the elevator will appear here like this 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:24.680
 that finish loading appears here 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:26.030
 my elevator good good how is that 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.700
 positions elevator 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:31.660
 see it is the following I have the measures 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:34.460
 Look at the dimensions of the elevator I can 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:37.970
 fill in after you take a slow look 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:39.170
 no problem on cd - I go then 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:41.630
 position the elevator 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:43.610
 his side and everything I'm going to leave 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:45.860
 here is a position that we know 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:47.600
 It does not make sense but it's just for 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:49.880
 you understand how the 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:53.040
 position him here 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:55.500
 and the elevator is inserted and the 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.210
 wall has already been interrupted here in 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.860
 his door position 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.020
 let's look at this here in three dimensions 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.420
 to understand well how it works 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.580
 Look, he just stood outside and 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.200
 The door is right there inside. 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:09.330
 if I had another wall here 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.250
 could have another entry for the 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:14.070
 down the elevator that has 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.600
 two inputs could not then have a 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:16.890
 another door here with an entrance too 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.450
 to that side 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.670
 this will vary from the component that 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:25.620
 You'll use it, I'll put it. 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:27.270
 here in a view the cut for example he 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.640
 this cut-off view is not appearing 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:31.530
 I'm going to change then cut opposition 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.490
 for that value appear to bring to 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.430
 here 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:38.280
 We returned to the sectional view and now 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:41.580
 Yes, elevator appears to be there. 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:45.150
 this part of the component that I can 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:46.230
 change its position which is the part of the 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.690
 motor right 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:52.020
 so I'll put it up here 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:57.300
 of the upper level 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:03:00.750
 so it is as if the engine is 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:03.330
 outside the building he's there for us 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:05.400
 we can understand the operation in the 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:10.290
 then take a look at this elevator and have a 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:12.150
 cable and an engine that will move this 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:15.780
 cable it stays here at the end then 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:18.720
 you can increase the scope of my 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:20.850
 preview cut look i made this 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.800
 way I'm showing the elevator and 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:23.700
 his motor as if it were floating 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:25.320
 there it's good 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:28.110
 It is evident that in a case of this 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:30.209
 would happen if the engine had to be 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:33.209
 supported something lift inside of 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:35.610
 a confined one in some walls 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:38.070
 I did it like this but for you to understand it 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:40.410
 for you to see how it is 

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:42.030
 what is this component and in 3d 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:43.470
 this component shows only the 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:45.239
 lift ok 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:47.250
 logical that you do a blog inside 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:49.590
 make walls around and this will be a 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:51.900
 passed from end to end in your project 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:53.640
 if you want to move the elevator it 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:55.410
 is a component like any other 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:57.269
 so let's say I want to change now 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:59.700
 his position I can reverse 

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:03.000
 this elevator and put it to the side of 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:04.470
 inside, just click here on this 7 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.610
 I think he's going to reverse the 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:10.770
 And that's where you can reverse 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:11.940
 in both directions and so on not 

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:14.190
 There is no problem 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:16.859
 it is enough that you have a component that 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:18.870
 do what you want, you can do it 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:21.269
 change it with no problem let's go 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:22.710
 look now in 3d and see how it is 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:24.330
 at the elevator entrance if he was 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:27.210
 external as well 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:29.280
 I would stay that way and cut the 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:30.150
 lift will appear from this other 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:32.790
 way 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:35.070
 on the inside ok and this issue of 

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:37.800
 positioning of the motor etc. 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:39.750
 well all this will vary according to the 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:41.310
 component that you use therefore 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:43.140
 let's not go into details of the 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:45.200
 component but rather the idea of â€‹â€‹insertion 

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:48.350
 of the elevator that is basically you 

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:51.390
 and positioning a component to adjust and 

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:54.150
 location of engine and other measures 

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:55.860
 of him that you may want to change rock 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:57.870
 in the next video I'll show you 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:02.450
 how do you make a cut of the 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:02.450
 where a lift slab is passing
