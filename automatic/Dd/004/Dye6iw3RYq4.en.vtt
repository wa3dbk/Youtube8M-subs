the seasonality and I was I think one of

so many years ago and you know there's

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:35.890 
so many years ago and you know there's
several<00:00:34.580> adages<00:00:35.150> the<00:00:35.360> best<00:00:35.570> known<00:00:35.780> is

several adages the best known is

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:37.360

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:44.600 
seasonality is very very clear the

and a low usually occurs in August and
it<00:00:49.880> looks<00:00:50.210> as<00:00:50.390> if<00:00:50.450> that's<00:00:50.870> going<00:00:50.990> to<00:00:51.140> be<00:00:51.320> the

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:51.500

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:57.500 
the summer I was concerned with all that

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.770 
the summer I was concerned with all that
was<00:00:57.590> going<00:00:57.680> on<00:00:58.070> in<00:00:58.430> the<00:00:58.550> fundamental<00:00:59.150> analysis

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:02.270 
meaning with the euro crisis what was

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:03.999 
meaning with the euro crisis what was
going<00:01:02.600> on<00:01:02.720> with<00:01:02.899> noise<00:01:03.110> between<00:01:03.380> Iraq<00:01:03.980> and

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:06.860 
Iran and several other what I call wild

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.430

cards<00:01:07.340> and<00:01:07.550> it<00:01:08.150> looked<00:01:08.450> like<00:01:08.840> in<00:01:09.110> fact<00:01:09.320> the

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:09.440 
cards and it looked like in fact the

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:12.040 
cards and it looked like in fact the
market<00:01:09.860> was<00:01:10.010> signaling<00:01:10.550> a<00:01:10.729> chance<00:01:11.600> of<00:01:11.900> a

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:14.330 
breakaway move to the upside and this

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.149 
breakaway move to the upside and this

just the fundamentals myself

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:37.870 
just the fundamentals myself
particularly<00:01:34.880> is<00:01:35.330> it<00:01:35.930> just<00:01:36.409> didn't<00:01:36.880> catch

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 
particularly is it just didn't catch

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:39.850 
particularly is it just didn't catch
much<00:01:38.330> momentum<00:01:38.630> in<00:01:39.020> other<00:01:39.140> words<00:01:39.350> it<00:01:39.619> broke

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:39.860 
much momentum in other words it broke

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:43.660 
much momentum in other words it broke
through<00:01:40.190> the<00:01:40.220> 1250<00:01:40.940> level<00:01:41.330> in<00:01:41.630> gold<00:01:42.350> and<00:01:43.040> it

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670 
through the 1250 level in gold and it

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.910 
through the 1250 level in gold and it
held<00:01:44.119> up<00:01:44.270> very<00:01:44.330> strong<00:01:44.990> during<00:01:45.350> the<00:01:45.439> options

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 
held up very strong during the options

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.429 
held up very strong during the options
expiration<00:01:46.340> and<00:01:46.850> yet<00:01:47.479> there<00:01:47.869> was<00:01:47.960> no<00:01:48.140> follow

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:48.439 
expiration and yet there was no follow

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:50.109 
expiration and yet there was no follow
through<00:01:48.530> so<00:01:48.710> I<00:01:48.920> exited<00:01:49.520> the<00:01:49.670> trade<00:01:49.880> very

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:50.119

outpace gold until the panic buying
euphoric<00:04:35.920> phase<00:04:36.250> of<00:04:36.550> the<00:04:36.640> market<00:04:37.060> and<00:04:37.210> at<00:04:37.360> that

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:37.570 
euphoric phase of the market and at that

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:40.110 
euphoric phase of the market and at that
time<00:04:37.630> silver<00:04:38.440> really<00:04:38.800> overtook<00:04:39.400> gold<00:04:39.760> on<00:04:40.060> a

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:40.120 
time silver really overtook gold on a

time silver really overtook gold on a
percentage<00:04:40.990> basis<00:04:41.650> and<00:04:41.890> that's<00:04:42.040> pretty<00:04:42.280> much

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:42.400 
percentage basis and that's pretty much

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:45.210 
percentage basis and that's pretty much
what<00:04:42.730> to<00:04:42.820> expect<00:04:43.210> this<00:04:43.330> time<00:04:43.600> around<00:04:43.780> and<00:04:44.440> I

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:45.220 
what to expect this time around and I

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:46.350 
what to expect this time around and I
want<00:04:45.400> to<00:04:45.430> be<00:04:45.550> cautious<00:04:45.760> here<00:04:46.000> when<00:04:46.270> I<00:04:46.300> say

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:46.360 
want to be cautious here when I say

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:49.050 
want to be cautious here when I say
pretty<00:04:46.750> much<00:04:46.930> expect<00:04:47.470> because<00:04:48.060> the

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:49.060 
pretty much expect because the

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:51.240 
pretty much expect because the
fundamentals<00:04:49.780> for<00:04:49.990> silver<00:04:50.320> are<00:04:50.530> superior<00:04:51.130> to

gold<00:05:42.280> but<00:05:42.580> I<00:05:42.610> doubt<00:05:42.730> that<00:05:43.360> I<00:05:43.570> doubt<00:05:43.900> that<00:05:44.140> very

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:44.170 
gold but I doubt that I doubt that very

gold but I doubt that I doubt that very
much<00:05:44.500> I<00:05:44.920> mean<00:05:45.070> how<00:05:45.190> much<00:05:45.340> of<00:05:45.520> a<00:05:45.610> chance<00:05:46.060> do<00:05:46.270> we

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:46.330 
much I mean how much of a chance do we

much I mean how much of a chance do we
have<00:05:46.390> in<00:05:46.690> my<00:05:46.840> view<00:05:47.290> in<00:05:47.860> my<00:05:48.040> opinion<00:05:48.430> probably

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:49.390 
have in my view in my opinion probably

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:51.990 
have in my view in my opinion probably
less<00:05:49.900> than<00:05:50.050> a<00:05:50.110> one-percent<00:05:50.650> chance<00:05:50.790> silver<00:05:51.790> I

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:52.000

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.360 
less than a one-percent chance silver I
just<00:05:52.690> don't<00:05:53.020> see<00:05:53.230> it<00:05:53.320> being<00:05:53.530> confiscated<00:05:53.920> and

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:54.370 
just don't see it being confiscated and

just don't see it being confiscated and
all<00:05:54.490> I<00:05:54.520> give<00:05:54.940> it<00:05:55.060> almost<00:05:55.330> a<00:05:55.570> 0%<00:05:56.080> chance<00:05:56.380> to<00:05:56.710> be

if you're worried about confiscation is
probably<00:06:18.760> silver<00:06:19.180> or<00:06:19.300> gold<00:06:19.630> and<00:06:19.930> gold<00:06:20.050> is<00:06:20.260> not

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:23.110 
a worry to me so you know if it's a

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:25.230 
a worry to me so you know if it's a
concern<00:06:23.410> to<00:06:23.590> you<00:06:23.710> then<00:06:24.370> you<00:06:24.670> should<00:06:24.940> you<00:06:25.120> know

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:25.240 
concern to you then you should you know

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:27.270 
concern to you then you should you know
consider<00:06:25.690> that<00:06:25.960> in<00:06:26.230> your<00:06:26.440> analysis<00:06:26.650> on<00:06:27.220> what

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:27.280 
consider that in your analysis on what

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:29.880 
consider that in your analysis on what
you<00:06:27.670> should<00:06:27.850> buy<00:06:28.060> I<00:06:28.360> consider<00:06:29.260> the<00:06:29.500> fact<00:06:29.740> that

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:29.890 
you should buy I consider the fact that

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:32.460 
you should buy I consider the fact that
gold<00:06:30.670> is<00:06:30.880> probably<00:06:31.240> a<00:06:31.720> lot<00:06:31.960> more<00:06:31.990> stable

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:32.470 
gold is probably a lot more stable

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:34.410 
gold is probably a lot more stable
long-term<00:06:32.860> than<00:06:33.370> silver<00:06:33.640> I<00:06:33.880> don't<00:06:34.360> think

00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:34.420 
long-term than silver I don't think

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:35.760 
long-term than silver I don't think
you'll<00:06:34.630> get<00:06:34.750> the<00:06:34.930> gains<00:06:35.170> over<00:06:35.500> the<00:06:35.590> long<00:06:35.740> term

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:35.770 
you'll get the gains over the long term

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:37.530 
you'll get the gains over the long term
that<00:06:36.220> you<00:06:36.340> will<00:06:36.520> but<00:06:36.760> I<00:06:36.850> think<00:06:37.090> everyone

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:37.540 
that you will but I think everyone

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:38.910 
that you will but I think everyone
should<00:06:37.570> own<00:06:37.810> both<00:06:38.110> metals<00:06:38.530> they<00:06:38.770> have

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:38.920 
should own both metals they have

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:41.220 
should own both metals they have
different<00:06:39.160> purposes<00:06:39.760> really<00:06:40.090> silver<00:06:40.900> sort<00:06:41.140> of

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:41.980
