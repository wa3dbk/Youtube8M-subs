00:00:10.739 --> 00:00:14.709
 quite a lot at the new milling head video animal park and allianz game i play 

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:18.300
 thought i'm just going to introduce a new ceo mike o and this is a series 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.949
 bakel say what comes to mind what 

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:24.890
 Saying overdinkel and where with certain decisions I could make it is just 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:27.230
 like to go and we are going to see for the first time a game 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:29.859
 which is just about openness jack players going to play a game 

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:32.960
 and I'm just going to explain why I walk to the left why I now 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.320
 more options to stay here have lisse but I will not come to see why now 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.039
 this also why I do that so I hope you can go here for something 

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:41.400
 learn and do everything just list he can play 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.380
 I had to leave bodies and we are just going to try to lower the growth score 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:47.560
 maybe we'll go sometime what bad market will be just when we meet it 

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:51.180
 play you would say why I die why I actually do not make this decision 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.310
 should have taken a role so team team that is also because he puts me and me 

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:57.110
 just try to get a good score of course and if there was one 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:59.920
 like a series already late let's have his thumb wait 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.400
 grow rapidly but enormously 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.300
 I'll stay by watching the action and see that someone 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:05.070
 with the 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.390
 i think you wanted to sing she gave wagon with the ntr just play that person 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:11.880
 it wanted to be where he is that is not really one of the aleksei things 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:12.770
 to use 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.490
 it is not about just about how you play as what is going on 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:19.250
 Remains a bit behind with the search engine plays out the reinder 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.050
 ball of as with the same plays a reason at all card though I am 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:22.590
 always 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.510
 all children play threatened another time as quickly as possible 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:28.140
 they don't have any definite nea stanisic cell phones 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.979
 really calm that probably still to be done by them 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:33.200
 If your home needs the melody don't have a certain distance 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.049
 going from particles back to the netherlands when your weapon suddenly goes up again 

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:36.440
 off 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:39.390
 that guy your blanket unfortunately i hope they are down the street from the we must now 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:39.860
 just too 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.780
 the tea they pay attention that they said they use so that is not on the 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:43.799
 minimap gets to see 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.459
 when we start shooting because for me the whole team uses the rest 

00:01:46.459 --> 00:01:47.429
 they are so we must 

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:50.269
 pay attention and look again at Zwijnaarde 

00:01:50.269 --> 00:01:53.130
 side of mice what wants to shop what the in it I do not go 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.009
 what I obviously do not like is a sarenza from the bridge guitar 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.429
 what I sport woman poor beast once walked in and as a the 

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:01.200
 bus going against his owner's crown 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.149
 well done that I do not mock stories that they come again 

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:06.930
 again the same 2 of course I have certainly not had a different suit 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:07.619
 effect on 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.340
 it probably doesn't bother me where it will stay again of course 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:10.979
 lie there 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.410
 now we have got soldiers will also be here for a while 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.660
 that good am just back of suit that the throat is good in essence he wants 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:19.730
 canturi viale and perhaps also apparently too soon 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:20.040
 to bite 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.569
 when I say that I now know three in a four-door you just have to 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:25.819
 the race is reluctant to play just as you can in vianen you become 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:28.709
 of course no longer seen on the radar for a moment because I know they 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:31.840
 not all of them to come and you see it on the maps is getting closer 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.819
 so where are now just a piece behind that guy who controls the 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:35.200
 ridicule 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.030
 it seems like it stood or stood there is a slanted eye running behind it just look 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:41.019
 and that is another one behind months ten spain next to me so I was 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:41.989
 just sun 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:45.400
 smoking expire the courses in the cultivation of cyrus vance now on the other side of 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.499
 the whirlpool we just have to look forward to 

00:02:47.499 --> 00:02:49.310
 the van there there was once on beam 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:53.160
 According to Bajema, the rest of the gang burglars are Palestinian 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.890
 doortje put out to grind that we can not catch on a smiley 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:56.290
 shoot 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:59.260
 madam there of course again a temporary problem it off with the number 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.420
 black white now does road racing through my spot with fat and now I know where they are 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.799
 walk now we can play chill now we can go over one 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:06.340
 and so now just go see you 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:07.889
 tisci because now I know exactly 

00:03:07.889 --> 00:03:11.430
 what they are running to look at and what they are doing and you just have to 

00:03:11.429 --> 00:03:14.019
 must remain in the air as quickly as possible and if you are there it shows 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:17.239
 in the air from where it all goes automatically you don't know exactly where they are 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:17.639
 walk 

00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:20.450
 you can now just the outcome you can that sponsor you can do everything 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:23.140
 what you actually wanted to do the whole game but you just have to be happy 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:26.150
 in the air to achieve that we will have that place with in the air i have 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.669
 of course 

00:03:26.669 --> 00:03:31.229
 ommen nijmegen live normal and suffer from pilot side effects what can you do 

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:34.699
 cards except and mastercard finished and need the normal summer sentences 

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:37.839
 you nothing and and son saif on we became citizens again I am still 

00:03:37.839 --> 00:03:40.519
 but got cold in the time trial because of course they no longer know where I am 

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:44.079
 also take a pilot and just take the men aloof part 

00:03:44.679 --> 00:03:45.719
 shoot 

00:03:45.719 --> 00:03:48.619
 and so from his eight onwards that you should always pay attention when they can 

00:03:48.619 --> 00:03:49.510
 tension everywhere 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:52.530
 They also stretch over to make sure the game will continue to pay attention to what work it's over 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:55.809
 emily the rope a little bit of rest 

00:03:55.809 --> 00:03:58.629
 because they know that I am walking here I know that we are walking there so now we have to be fine 

00:03:58.629 --> 00:03:59.339
 pay attention 

00:03:59.339 --> 00:04:02.549
 to keep tensing in messages and I am going to look toto that point in the dark 

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:05.669
 of course I did not touch more scores and therefore not that time I started too 

00:04:05.669 --> 00:04:06.329
 actually 

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:09.939
 dripping a little too fast to walk they boeschoten slightly quieter play 

00:04:09.939 --> 00:04:12.769
 I had to run those tensions because there it was much better 

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:15.590
 but the but of course not from some of the step you can just learn a lot 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:17.329
 And then you also just have to be honest 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:20.120
 the man who already walked mine if you just stay calm 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.979
 just keep playing quietly and when you die it will always be one 

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:25.540
 reason and then it may be a reason that the first quarter of forest already 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:26.090
 a session 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:28.840
 but it is usually for a reason that makes a mistake in it 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:29.610
 the game itself 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:32.520
 and then you have to learn from for your better player and then you can 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:33.140
 also large 

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:35.240
 get better scores if you had learned before 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:37.940
 You see three men stealing in. She's waiting for CIOs a bit back 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:38.650
 burp 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:40.770
 I know that I am somewhere in the middle this time 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:43.840
 who goes from state to state ado by an end they want us to stand in its place 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:45.560
 nice the job always on the side 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:48.740
 and i also know that they are still very in the middle of the he they walk 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:52.400
 picked up a shop it was of course a stylist can take my shot down after 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:55.120
 caught the rest i also know that on the other hand i love distance 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:58.389
 so we now also not on the throat is made that I have an SSD part 

00:04:58.389 --> 00:04:59.910
 we can now go slowly again 

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:02.479
 I would be fine with it if I knew it was ventilating 

00:05:02.479 --> 00:05:05.639
 and now I'm going to make the stupid action because I went for it with brand come with 

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:07.970
 night is by all hands of mattheüs grillo de werk 

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:11.390
 the world kill streak 7 cyrus the honor i know she usually exists i see 

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:12.819
 will be fine just like now 

00:05:12.819 --> 00:05:14.910
 this really does not affect the cut situation today 

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:17.610
 and the west there you can of course just the race that is really it 

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:19.029
 wall of the schie 

00:05:19.029 --> 00:05:22.279
 two centimeters thick or something so I knew I died here and it was just 

00:05:22.279 --> 00:05:24.500
 also stop but that I actually continued to work there 

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:27.610
 I should have walked back again just to go there for cover 

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:28.030
 Search 

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:31.450
 but salzburg everything to go but sometimes that is just not convenient to 

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:34.280
 but cole will also be behind you then you will probably go less 

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:34.919
 often dead 

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:37.749
 and if you just keep driving like a headless chicken what I do now 

00:05:37.749 --> 00:05:39.569
 of course also participated and I saw 

00:05:39.569 --> 00:05:42.679
 no and indie-rock stage there than a minute but it was party time 

00:05:42.679 --> 00:05:43.379
 Christmas thought 

00:05:43.379 --> 00:05:46.189
 and that guy who has maltreatment space as a tribute to the tank 

00:05:46.189 --> 00:05:48.909
 he calculates himself because then you are just dead you can't do anything about it 

00:05:48.909 --> 00:05:50.560
 as a tribute to the better 

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:53.950
 he scored 6 2 around 4 with the whole non stop talking warm 

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:55.310
 make certain decisions 

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:58.250
 found another cable in the first episode let us know in the 

00:05:58.250 --> 00:05:58.729
 responses 

00:05:58.729 --> 00:06:01.729
 because I will make more episodes and maybe an official one again 

00:06:01.729 --> 00:06:04.849
 make series of these to oaks breeds game is guys 

00:06:04.849 --> 00:06:07.930
 thanks watching moggré series well just see inside on mike no then 

00:06:07.929 --> 00:06:09.030
 please go to block 

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:12.250
 If they finish up monitoring wells this remarkable name the maker just one 

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:12.860
 series barrel 

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:15.819
 So it is viewing he scored was six or four until the next time
