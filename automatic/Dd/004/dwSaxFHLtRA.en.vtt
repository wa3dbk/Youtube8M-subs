00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
if you're gonna do your nails you should

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.870 
if you're gonna do your nails you should
do<00:01:31.229> them<00:01:31.380> in<00:01:31.590> a<00:01:31.680> well-ventilated<00:01:31.890> area

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
do them in a well-ventilated area

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.480 
do them in a well-ventilated area
because<00:01:33.840> or<00:01:34.619> somewhere<00:01:34.979> you<00:01:35.189> don't<00:01:35.250> want<00:01:35.340> to

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
because or somewhere you don't want to

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.270 
because or somewhere you don't want to
make<00:01:36.170> the<00:01:37.170> whole<00:01:37.350> house<00:01:37.560> smell<00:01:37.920> like<00:01:37.950> the

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
make the whole house smell like the

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.190 
make the whole house smell like the
liquid<00:01:38.579> because<00:01:38.850> it's<00:01:39.030> really<00:01:39.180> strong<00:01:39.570> and<00:01:39.780> it

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
liquid because it's really strong and it

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.760 
liquid because it's really strong and it
has<00:01:40.350> that<00:01:40.590> funky<00:01:41.189> smell<00:01:41.369> so<00:01:42.180> I<00:01:42.740> recommend<00:01:43.740> that

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
has that funky smell so I recommend that

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.039 
has that funky smell so I recommend that
you<00:01:43.860> do<00:01:44.009> it<00:01:44.100> in<00:01:44.189> the<00:01:44.280> well-ventilated<00:01:44.640> area<00:01:45.420> or

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
you do it in the well-ventilated area or

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.230 
you do it in the well-ventilated area or
you<00:01:46.290> can<00:01:46.470> do<00:01:46.590> it<00:01:46.740> outside<00:01:47.040> if<00:01:47.549> you<00:01:47.670> want<00:01:47.850> to<00:01:48.030> I

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
you can do it outside if you want to I

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.660 
you can do it outside if you want to I
