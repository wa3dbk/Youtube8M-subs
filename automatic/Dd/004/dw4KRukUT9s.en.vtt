00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:08.520
 hello let's see today the laser swords 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.780
 lie the fluorescent tubes is a 

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:12.210
 fluorescent tube with which you can 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.710
 find in a kitchen in a room 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:18.940
 bathroom in a 

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:21.130
 of school in a hospital I do not know are 

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:23.260
 good bulbs light bulbs are a kind of 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:26.290
 light they have as an advantage with respect 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:29.349
 to the traditional bulbs that emit 

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:31.029
 light all along the tube is not 

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:33.400
 only a single point of light like 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:36.579
 light bulbs that are emitted from 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:38.440
 that point and not behind him or this is 

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:43.300
 type of light is going to emit a lot of light 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:46.270
 another advantage is a good cheap light if 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:49.420
 does not consume not as much energy as a 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:53.230
 conventional bulb but it illuminates a lot 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:55.420
 rather up to here the good things of 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:57.699
 that kind of light that happens from time to time 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:00.489
 when these bulbs or good this guy 

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:02.940
 of light or it does not turn on or it gives 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:07.340
 blink in plan I have an attack 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:10.759
 psychedelic epileptic 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:13.159
 in that case these bulbs or this one 

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:16.130
 this kind of light is not that they have broken 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:17.869
 it is simply that the piece that is 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.270
 turn on is wrong 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:22.130
 many times we buy a new tube 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:24.200
 thinking that it is the tube what is wrong 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:27.409
 when what really fails is the 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:31.609
 primer the primer is what makes 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:33.289
 this light inside turn on there is 

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:37.340
 a process that is not exactly what is 

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:40.039
 but what controls is this piece that 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.299
 the tube is illuminated and as what 

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:43.520
 we want is light when we give the 

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:47.030
 switch is very important to know that 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:49.130
 let's see how to change this element 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:51.200
 key that is the primer that by the way 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:53.979
 it's very cheap I think it's worth a euro 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.979
 there in any hardware store 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.950
 Well, this is the basis of 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.620
 fluorescent and this is the gap in the 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.450
 that the primer is installed to be able 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:05.190
 access the hole and the primer first 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.130
 you have to remove the tube here the tube is 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:10.009
 dismantled and here is the gap here 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.630
 is the primer then just 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:14.610
 there is only one position we put and 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:17.870
 we turn until it stays embedded not 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.870
 has greater difficulty than that 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.750
 let's see him then in his position 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:25.550
 we press that it has fit and now 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:28.080
 we place the present 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:29.880
 which has two rails 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:33.210
 has two contacts there on each side 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:37.390
 we are simply and so that he stays 

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:40.270
 fixed we turn inward beyond 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:41.410
 this way I will not turn on because 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:43.990
 will dazzle the camera and you will see 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:46.090
 wrong but in this way we will end up with 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:49.350
 the problems of ignition of the tube and already 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:49.350
 there will be no more blinks
