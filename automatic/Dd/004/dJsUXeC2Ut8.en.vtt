the<00:02:53.460> ingredient<00:02:54.030> list<00:02:54.210> and<00:02:54.450> knew<00:02:54.840> that<00:02:55.100> this

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
the ingredient list and knew that this

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.310 
the ingredient list and knew that this
is<00:02:56.310> just<00:02:56.490> a<00:02:56.580> product<00:02:56.820> that<00:02:57.120> everybody<00:02:57.540> can<00:02:58.080> use

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:16.910 
it's pretty much the same depending on

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:19.610

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:50.519 
well technically anyone can use it so if

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:52.370 
well technically anyone can use it so if
you<00:03:50.700> want<00:03:50.880> to<00:03:50.970> try<00:03:51.180> now<00:03:51.360> anything<00:03:51.930> that<00:03:52.110> you

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:52.380 
you want to try now anything that you

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:54.770 
you want to try now anything that you
may<00:03:52.560> have<00:03:52.709> never<00:03:53.010> heard<00:03:53.190> of<00:03:53.700> you<00:03:54.360> can<00:03:54.540> go<00:03:54.660> ahead

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:57.080 
may have never heard of you can go ahead
and<00:03:55.019> try<00:03:55.230> it<00:03:55.260> out<00:03:55.470> because<00:03:56.040> most<00:03:56.550> likely<00:03:56.760> it's

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
and try it out because most likely it's

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:00.380 
and try it out because most likely it's
gonna<00:03:57.239> work<00:03:57.510> you<00:03:58.440> know<00:03:58.560> great<00:03:59.250> or<00:03:59.550> it<00:04:00.090> may<00:04:00.239> not

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:00.390 
gonna work you know great or it may not

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:02.900 
gonna work you know great or it may not
work<00:04:00.450> so<00:04:00.660> great<00:04:00.930> because<00:04:01.170> thinking<00:04:01.980> all<00:04:02.489> hair

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:02.910 
work so great because thinking all hair

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:05.210 
work so great because thinking all hair
textures<00:04:03.360> are<00:04:03.570> different<00:04:03.630> in<00:04:04.530> all<00:04:04.680> products

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
textures are different in all products

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:08.360 
textures are different in all products
don't<00:04:05.430> work<00:04:05.610> the<00:04:06.000> same<00:04:06.030> for<00:04:06.450> everybody<00:04:06.980> but<00:04:07.980> I

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
don't work the same for everybody but I

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:11.420 
don't work the same for everybody but I
feel<00:04:09.000> like<00:04:09.180> majority<00:04:10.140> of<00:04:10.260> products<00:04:10.769> do

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430 
feel like majority of products do

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:14.350 
feel like majority of products do
because<00:04:12.410> they<00:04:13.410> increase

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:14.360 
because they increase

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:16.210 
because they increase
less<00:04:14.570> things<00:04:14.930> don't<00:04:15.350> have<00:04:15.560> anything<00:04:15.800> to<00:04:16.070> do

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:16.220 
less things don't have anything to do

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:20.289 
less things don't have anything to do
with<00:04:16.480> this<00:04:17.480> is<00:04:17.690> for<00:04:17.900> black<00:04:18.140> people<00:04:19.120> it's<00:04:20.120> just

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:20.299 
with this is for black people it's just

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:21.370 
with this is for black people it's just
like<00:04:20.480> just<00:04:20.750> can't<00:04:20.930> teach<00:04:21.079> it<00:04:21.200> to<00:04:21.290> them

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:21.380 
like just can't teach it to them

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:23.560
