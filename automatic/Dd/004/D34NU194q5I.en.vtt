showing off the new combat system so

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.009 
showing off the new combat system so
there<00:00:09.320> was<00:00:09.410> a<00:00:09.440> big<00:00:09.769> update<00:00:10.099> for<00:00:10.789> how<00:00:11.599> the<00:00:11.660> game

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:12.019 
there was a big update for how the game

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:14.560 
there was a big update for how the game
worked<00:00:12.320> basically<00:00:12.650> and<00:00:13.280> they<00:00:14.209> still<00:00:14.419> have

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:14.570 
worked basically and they still have

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:16.750 
worked basically and they still have
some<00:00:14.780> big<00:00:14.929> updates<00:00:15.259> coming<00:00:15.559> but<00:00:15.769> mainly<00:00:16.190> they

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:16.760 
some big updates coming but mainly they

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:19.000 
some big updates coming but mainly they
just<00:00:17.060> released<00:00:17.360> a<00:00:17.480> new<00:00:17.660> combat<00:00:18.110> system<00:00:18.590> it

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:19.010 
just released a new combat system it

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:21.730 
just released a new combat system it
kind<00:00:19.430> of<00:00:19.640> works<00:00:20.020> similarly<00:00:21.020> to<00:00:21.170> how<00:00:21.440> it<00:00:21.680> was

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:21.740 
kind of works similarly to how it was

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:26.170 
kind of works similarly to how it was
before<00:00:22.120> but<00:00:23.120> it's<00:00:24.220> still<00:00:25.220> quite<00:00:25.610> different

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:26.180 
before but it's still quite different

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:29.920 
before but it's still quite different
and<00:00:26.380> to<00:00:27.380> do<00:00:27.650> it<00:00:27.800> effectively<00:00:28.160> you<00:00:28.610> do<00:00:28.820> need<00:00:29.150> a

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:29.930 
and to do it effectively you do need a

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:32.440 
and to do it effectively you do need a
hot<00:00:30.410> bar<00:00:30.650> well<00:00:30.920> there<00:00:31.490> is<00:00:31.580> a<00:00:31.610> default<00:00:32.029> hapa

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:32.450 
hot bar well there is a default hapa

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:34.720 
hot bar well there is a default hapa
which<00:00:32.750> is<00:00:32.930> typically<00:00:33.829> over<00:00:34.130> here<00:00:34.400> which<00:00:34.579> has

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:34.730 
which is typically over here which has

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:36.520 
which is typically over here which has
10<00:00:35.030> slot<00:00:35.360> so<00:00:35.510> you<00:00:35.540> can<00:00:35.720> use<00:00:35.840> that<00:00:36.020> as<00:00:36.170> well<00:00:36.320> just

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:36.530 
10 slot so you can use that as well just

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:38.680 
10 slot so you can use that as well just
drag<00:00:36.860> the<00:00:37.370> icons<00:00:37.790> of<00:00:37.970> the<00:00:38.000> combat<00:00:38.510> mechanics

these the first thing you have to learn
is<00:00:47.860> self-defense<00:00:48.860> this<00:00:49.340> will<00:00:49.489> unlock<00:00:49.820> basic

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:50.660 
is self-defense this will unlock basic

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:53.799 
is self-defense this will unlock basic
combat<00:00:51.620> options<00:00:52.100> and<00:00:52.340> what<00:00:53.030> I<00:00:53.210> have<00:00:53.480> right<00:00:53.750> now

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:53.809 
combat options and what I have right now

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:58.990 
combat options and what I have right now
is<00:00:54.670> also<00:00:55.670> back<00:00:56.600> alley<00:00:56.899> pugilism<00:00:57.710> and<00:00:58.100> this

00:00:58.990 --> 00:00:59.000 
is also back alley pugilism and this

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.330 
is also back alley pugilism and this
unlocks<00:00:59.899> even<00:01:00.200> more<00:01:00.440> moves<00:01:00.710> things<00:01:01.040> like

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:01.340 
unlocks even more moves things like

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.329 
unlocks even more moves things like
stomping<00:01:02.030> uppercut<00:01:02.780> and<00:01:02.809> stuff<00:01:03.200> like<00:01:03.350> that<00:01:03.410> so

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:04.339 
stomping uppercut and stuff like that so

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:06.910 
stomping uppercut and stuff like that so
there<00:01:04.549> are<00:01:04.729> further<00:01:05.440> combat<00:01:06.440> moves<00:01:06.590> but<00:01:06.799> I'm

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:06.920 
there are further combat moves but I'm

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:08.260 
there are further combat moves but I'm
going<00:01:07.040> to<00:01:07.100> be<00:01:07.190> working<00:01:07.340> with<00:01:07.580> these<00:01:07.760> so<00:01:08.060> if<00:01:08.120> you

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:08.270 
going to be working with these so if you

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:10.780 
going to be working with these so if you
can<00:01:08.390> see<00:01:08.600> here<00:01:08.900> it's<00:01:09.380> now<00:01:09.710> separated<00:01:10.580> into

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:10.790 
can see here it's now separated into

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:13.870 
can see here it's now separated into
three<00:01:11.470> categories<00:01:12.470> here<00:01:12.979> we<00:01:13.070> got<00:01:13.190> the<00:01:13.310> tech<00:01:13.610> so

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:13.880 
three categories here we got the tech so

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.330 
three categories here we got the tech so
you<00:01:13.940> can<00:01:14.090> see<00:01:14.240> punch<00:01:14.659> roundhouse<00:01:15.619> kick<00:01:16.070> that's

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:16.340 
you can see punch roundhouse kick that's

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.990 
you can see punch roundhouse kick that's
new<00:01:16.610> by<00:01:16.820> the<00:01:16.880> way<00:01:17.060> stomp<00:01:17.810> an<00:01:18.020> uppercut<00:01:19.000> under

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:22.040 
maneuvers there's a god this is the

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:28.100 
as you can see that significantly

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:31.510 
as you can see that significantly
reduces<00:01:28.670> the<00:01:29.060> damage<00:01:29.360> you<00:01:29.689> take<00:01:29.990> and<00:01:30.590> then

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
this one says regain composure there's a

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.039 
this one says regain composure there's a
few<00:01:37.159> things<00:01:37.340> that<00:01:37.549> can<00:01:37.760> affect<00:01:37.909> you<00:01:38.450> such<00:01:38.810> as

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:39.049 
few things that can affect you such as

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:41.109 
few things that can affect you such as
if<00:01:39.380> you<00:01:39.500> do<00:01:39.680> things<00:01:39.920> like<00:01:40.010> stomp<00:01:40.430> or<00:01:40.640> uppercuts

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:41.119 
if you do things like stomp or uppercuts

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:44.320 
if you do things like stomp or uppercuts
you<00:01:41.510> can<00:01:41.659> actually<00:01:41.920> lose<00:01:42.920> your<00:01:42.979> balance<00:01:43.400> which

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:44.330 
you can actually lose your balance which

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:46.600 
you can actually lose your balance which
means<00:01:44.720> your<00:01:45.290> attacks<00:01:45.590> might<00:01:45.799> miss<00:01:46.100> more<00:01:46.400> or

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:46.610

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:49.159 
you when you get hit you can also be

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:51.160

see<00:02:01.790> how<00:02:01.820> it<00:02:02.000> was<00:02:02.210> before<00:02:02.450> but<00:02:02.930> I'm<00:02:03.200> going<00:02:03.380> to

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:03.470 
see how it was before but I'm going to

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:05.500 
see how it was before but I'm going to
show<00:02:03.590> you<00:02:03.650> how<00:02:03.800> it<00:02:03.920> works<00:02:03.950> now<00:02:04.340> so<00:02:05.120> basically

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:05.510 
show you how it works now so basically

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:08.410 
show you how it works now so basically
it<00:02:06.380> works<00:02:06.710> similarly<00:02:07.580> where<00:02:07.850> you<00:02:07.940> walk<00:02:08.149> up<00:02:08.300> to

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 
it works similarly where you walk up to

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:10.090 
it works similarly where you walk up to
the<00:02:08.510> critic<00:02:08.840> it<00:02:09.020> and<00:02:09.200> you<00:02:09.350> want<00:02:09.470> to<00:02:09.649> activate

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:10.100 
the critic it and you want to activate

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:13.450 
the critic it and you want to activate
your<00:02:10.160> guard<00:02:10.640> stance<00:02:11.120> but<00:02:11.900> now<00:02:12.250> when<00:02:13.250> you

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:13.460 
your guard stance but now when you

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:15.790 
your guard stance but now when you
select<00:02:14.300> an<00:02:14.660> attack<00:02:14.960> it<00:02:15.140> automatically

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
select an attack it automatically

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.830 
select an attack it automatically
changes<00:02:16.280> the<00:02:16.580> cursor<00:02:16.820> to<00:02:17.030> the<00:02:17.060> attack<00:02:17.420> icon

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
changes the cursor to the attack icon

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.690 
changes the cursor to the attack icon
and<00:02:18.020> you<00:02:18.080> want<00:02:18.560> to<00:02:18.650> click<00:02:18.860> in<00:02:19.070> the<00:02:19.400> direction

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
and you want to click in the direction

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.330 
and you want to click in the direction
of<00:02:20.150> the<00:02:20.720> cricket<00:02:21.140> so<00:02:21.860> you<00:02:21.950> can<00:02:22.070> see<00:02:22.160> that<00:02:22.190> I

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:22.489 
it now involves black bile now black

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:25.420 
it now involves black bile now black
bile<00:03:22.700> tends<00:03:23.060> to<00:03:23.209> be<00:03:23.390> for<00:03:23.840> your<00:03:24.040> mental<00:03:25.040> stuff

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:25.430

usually<00:03:25.670> for<00:03:26.000> studying<00:03:26.390> or<00:03:26.750> placing<00:03:27.320> down

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
usually for studying or placing down

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.610 
usually for studying or placing down
construction<00:03:27.860> signs<00:03:28.400> but<00:03:29.060> now<00:03:29.440> when<00:03:30.440> you're

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:30.620 
construction signs but now when you're

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:33.790 
construction signs but now when you're
in<00:03:30.890> combat<00:03:31.250> you<00:03:31.910> can<00:03:32.239> have<00:03:32.510> fear<00:03:32.989> induced<00:03:33.620> on

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:33.800 
in combat you can have fear induced on

to<00:03:33.950> you<00:03:34.040> and<00:03:34.070> that<00:03:34.459> will<00:03:34.580> slowly<00:03:34.970> drain<00:03:35.510> your

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:35.720 
to you and that will slowly drain your

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:38.500 
to you and that will slowly drain your
black<00:03:35.959> bile<00:03:36.260> so<00:03:37.100> that<00:03:37.340> adds<00:03:37.580> another<00:03:38.360> element

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:38.510 
black bile so that adds another element

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:41.350 
black bile so that adds another element
to<00:03:38.900> combat<00:03:39.410> to<00:03:39.560> consider<00:03:39.980> overall<00:03:40.910> the<00:03:41.030> combat

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:41.360 
to combat to consider overall the combat

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:46.270 
to combat to consider overall the combat
system<00:03:41.540> is<00:03:42.019> a<00:03:42.530> lot<00:03:42.830> more<00:03:42.860> complicated<00:03:43.600> but<00:03:45.280> it

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280 
system is a lot more complicated but it

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:49.240 
system is a lot more complicated but it
actually<00:03:46.610> is<00:03:47.060> a<00:03:47.120> lot<00:03:47.510> more<00:03:47.660> fun<00:03:47.930> and<00:03:48.230> in<00:03:48.680> some

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:49.250 
actually is a lot more fun and in some

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:51.910 
actually is a lot more fun and in some
ways<00:03:49.459> it's<00:03:49.760> more<00:03:49.940> newbie<00:03:50.360> friendly<00:03:50.920> because

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:51.920 
ways it's more newbie friendly because

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:53.770 
ways it's more newbie friendly because
the<00:03:52.250> crickets<00:03:52.610> do<00:03:52.730> back<00:03:52.970> away<00:03:53.269> and<00:03:53.420> give<00:03:53.630> you<00:03:53.720> a

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780 
the crickets do back away and give you a

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:55.090 
the crickets do back away and give you a
bit<00:03:53.930> of<00:03:53.959> time<00:03:54.230> to<00:03:54.380> breathe<00:03:54.620> which<00:03:54.860> kind<00:03:55.070> of

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:55.100 
bit of time to breathe which kind of

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:56.920 
bit of time to breathe which kind of
gives<00:03:55.220> you<00:03:55.340> a<00:03:55.370> chance<00:03:55.580> to<00:03:55.850> walk<00:03:56.060> away<00:03:56.090> so<00:03:56.750> let's

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:58.250 
try kill this one as well it's always

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:59.949 
try kill this one as well it's always
good<00:03:58.519> to<00:03:58.550> start<00:03:58.700> with<00:03:58.910> a<00:03:59.000> stun<00:03:59.360> so<00:03:59.600> let's<00:03:59.780> start

00:03:59.949 --> 00:03:59.959 
good to start with a stun so let's start

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:03.360 
good to start with a stun so let's start
with<00:04:00.080> that<00:04:00.290> and<00:04:00.530> let's<00:04:01.070> try<00:04:01.670> an<00:04:01.970> uppercut

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:03.370 
with that and let's try an uppercut

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:06.270 
with that and let's try an uppercut
and<00:04:03.840> that's<00:04:04.840> a<00:04:04.989> lot<00:04:05.170> more<00:04:05.349> powerful<00:04:06.040> of<00:04:06.190> an

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:06.280 
and that's a lot more powerful of an

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:08.430 
and that's a lot more powerful of an
attack<00:04:06.580> so<00:04:06.700> I<00:04:06.730> took<00:04:06.790> it<00:04:06.970> right<00:04:07.239> out<00:04:07.299> but<00:04:08.140> it

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:08.440 
attack so I took it right out but it

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:10.110 
attack so I took it right out but it
does<00:04:08.650> drain<00:04:09.010> more<00:04:09.310> of<00:04:09.370> my<00:04:09.489> energies<00:04:09.909> as<00:04:10.030> you

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.120 
does drain more of my energies as you

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:11.550 
does drain more of my energies as you
can<00:04:10.269> see<00:04:10.540> so<00:04:10.780> I'll<00:04:10.900> just<00:04:10.930> pick<00:04:11.260> up<00:04:11.379> this

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:11.560 
can see so I'll just pick up this

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:14.610 
can see so I'll just pick up this
cricket<00:04:12.090> so<00:04:13.090> that<00:04:13.239> basically<00:04:13.540> concludes<00:04:14.319> how

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:14.620 
cricket so that basically concludes how

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:17.219 
cricket so that basically concludes how
the<00:04:14.680> new<00:04:15.159> combat<00:04:15.610> system<00:04:16.030> works<00:04:16.449> a<00:04:16.780> word<00:04:17.199> of

00:04:17.219 --> 00:04:17.229 
the new combat system works a word of

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:20.219 
the new combat system works a word of
warning<00:04:17.880> crickets<00:04:18.880> can't<00:04:19.389> kill<00:04:19.750> you<00:04:19.900> they<00:04:20.109> can
