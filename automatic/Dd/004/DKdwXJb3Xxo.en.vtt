00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.330
 Hello, I'm someone at 92 now that I have nothing to do here 

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:08.349
 of every stupidity that I could think of before I'm going to talk about a 

00:00:08.349 --> 00:00:12.140
 theme that fascinates us all and others the abhorrent I am talking about the 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:17.369
 strange video games obviously most are from 1999 down 

00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:21.659
 as I am a collector of pixelated video games there gives them 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.259
 well this is the first many already know polybius the arcade of terror 

00:00:27.989 --> 00:00:31.389
 it says so not because it's like 'the silence' does not reside evil 

00:00:31.389 --> 00:00:34.640
 in fact it is a classic game of little heads but in this one you have to 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.800
 will shoot some things that come out of a platform and instead of handling the ship 

00:00:38.799 --> 00:00:42.930
 you must spin the platform in the end this game causes insomnia and if 

00:00:42.929 --> 00:00:46.100
 you got to sleep you get nightmares at midnight 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:50.420
 they also provoked the desire to commit suicide and addiction to the game see faces in the 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:52.510
 darkness and epilepsies 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:56.570
 they say that this game was an experiment of the American government the 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.550
 company that did it was called sines the 100 but some assure that it was 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:02.440
 atari with another name 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:06.540
 Finally this game can be downloaded from your website but have 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:07.710
 watch out 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.330
 I have this game in my memory vsb but I'm afraid to play it 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:16.490
 this is the hardest game in the world is a fucking little box that you must take it 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:20.460
 from one green area to another and sometimes take the little yellow dots along the way 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:25.820
 it sounds easy but it's not like that because of some fucking blue dots that move 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.140
 too fast and they kill you with so much that you touch them 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:33.670
 this game is somewhat addictive but it is not exasperating, in fact it is very funny 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:36.230
 I have only reached the third level 

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:39.050
 to see to which one and you arrive 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:43.570
 this is mega don t is another ship if you drink kill some Martians but not 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:44.790
 it's like polybius 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.930
 but this is considered the most epileptic game in history because when 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.620
 advancing this level you took a life ended the game or they killed you they left 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:57.280
 a lot of very bright colors that made you throw them to the ground that 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.090
 twist if you vomit abás 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.070
 this game is in mulá dormán and if you want to download it you can 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:06.520
 do it but I recommend that you play it in broad daylight with the 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.310
 windows and doors open for the sun to enter success and lower the 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:12.039
 lighting to the monitor 

00:02:12.039 --> 00:02:13.489
 jejejeje 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:16.549
 this is manjunatha the most violent game in the world 

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:20.289
 I believe that because I saw others but they did not seem so violent 

00:02:20.289 --> 00:02:24.059
 the game is about an ox that is executed but then it turns out that it is not 

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:27.979
 died and you must escape from a prison killing those who will cross you 

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:32.079
 even this game led to jail a young man who was very fan of the game and 

00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:33.379
 he killed someone 

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:35.759
 and guess who created the game 

00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:39.529
 nothing more and nothing less than rockstar games if you're an ignoramus that only 

00:02:39.529 --> 00:02:43.319
 play for playing and you do not know what is rockstar games is the same as did the 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:46.319
 grand theft auto or as more the san andrés know him 

00:02:46.899 --> 00:02:50.219
 there's going to be another very violent game for the nintendo wii 

00:02:50.219 --> 00:02:53.359
 but I do not have much information about him 

00:02:53.359 --> 00:02:57.109
 I think they are all maybe talk to them about video games but it will be in another 

00:02:57.109 --> 00:02:58.919
 chance 

00:02:58.919 --> 00:03:01.400
 There goes a joke doctor doctor 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:02.669
 tell me the truth 

00:03:02.669 --> 00:03:06.039
 after the operation I could play the guitar 

00:03:06.039 --> 00:03:09.039
 yes man perfectly 

00:03:09.939 --> 00:03:12.059
 because before I did not know 

00:03:12.059 --> 00:03:15.059
 aha hahahahahahahahahahah jua jua jua 

00:03:16.469 --> 00:03:19.299
 what a condom and bowler resembles 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:24.120
 in that if they burst and you took the fuck jajajajajajajajaja butt ass 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.069

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:31.069
 I leave them to God 

00:03:33.059 --> 00:03:36.059
 one moment I noticed something during the video 

00:03:36.869 --> 00:03:40.879
 in the image of politicians I put an effect on him to bring the image closer and 

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:42.719
 in that you see this 

00:03:42.719 --> 00:03:45.719
 you can see how some paintings are fast approaching 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:50.149

00:03:51.869 --> 00:03:52.849
