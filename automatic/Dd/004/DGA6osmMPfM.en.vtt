pretty unlucky that hand and he's
running<00:00:08.069> the<00:00:08.160> scenarios<00:00:08.760> and<00:00:09.000> if<00:00:09.090> he<00:00:09.240> would

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
pot could potentially be an all in I

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.890 
pot could potentially be an all in I
mean<00:01:16.920> you<00:01:17.250> know<00:01:17.640> I<00:01:17.670> mean<00:01:17.850> I<00:01:18.240> really<00:01:18.750> didn't

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
mean you know I mean I really didn't

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.570 
mean you know I mean I really didn't
think<00:01:18.960> that<00:01:19.080> being<00:01:19.380> off<00:01:19.530> any<00:01:19.799> all<00:01:20.070> ends<00:01:20.430> for

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
think that being off any all ends for

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.530 
think that being off any all ends for
the<00:01:20.640> first<00:01:20.909> hour<00:01:21.180> of<00:01:21.450> real<00:01:21.780> play<00:01:22.110> here<00:01:23.540> and

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
the first hour of real play here and

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:25.969 
the first hour of real play here and
just<00:01:24.840> those<00:01:24.960> percentages<00:01:25.380> showing<00:01:25.860> that

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
just those percentages showing that

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.210 
just those percentages showing that
Dhawan<00:01:26.759> is<00:01:27.060> a<00:01:27.600> little<00:01:27.990> bit<00:01:28.140> ahead<00:01:28.439> here<00:01:28.740> but

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
Dhawan is a little bit ahead here but

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.399 
Dhawan is a little bit ahead here but
he's<00:01:29.340> got<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:29.820> kind<00:01:30.030> of<00:01:30.180> hand<00:01:30.390> where<00:01:30.930> there's

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
he's got the kind of hand where there's

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.950 
he's got the kind of hand where there's
really<00:01:31.560> nothing<00:01:32.100> that<00:01:32.130> he's<00:01:32.540> behind<00:01:33.540> if<00:01:33.869> you

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
really nothing that he's behind if you

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.749 
really nothing that he's behind if you
know<00:01:34.049> what<00:01:34.200> I<00:01:34.229> mean<00:01:34.470> yeah<00:01:34.860> unless<00:01:35.070> tell<00:01:35.520> me<00:01:35.579> she

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
has a set yeah you know and it's

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.289 
has a set yeah you know and it's

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299
