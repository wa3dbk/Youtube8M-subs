00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:09.840
 in November of the year 2000 these days ago 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.519
 It was released by a modification 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.889
 half-life knew 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.139
 the game that was very successful at the time 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.510
 I could not imagine the success 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:21.570
 expansion years later with the name 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.580
 the counter strike is famous cs the game 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.640
 which was not even a game 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.650
 earning a franchise only his and one more 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:32.550
 decade later we hit counter-strike 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:34.829
 global offensive is the cs go a game 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.290
 identical to all the franchise more with 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.600
 best graphics of all redone 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.540
 but you, you're a fan of the series and 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.649
 did not play seven go will see that the game will not 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.739
 changed almost nothing 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.059
 using the same engine the game is very 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:49.800
 similar to the ancients because they did not 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.199
 have no great news 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.850
 the maps are the same a bit more 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.190
 detailed as well as 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.649
 characters are also cuter and 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.480
 with more polygons and weapons are almost 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.640
 all of them also have some 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.040
 small changes with some weapons 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.510
 new ones also outside the classical and 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.689
 a weapon that catches everyone's attention 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.670
 what is the call seuss is higher 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.799
 futuristic shooting in the foot for those who kill 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.330
 fax and can download a few thousand 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.220
 volts 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.140
 the next Sunday was also 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.150
 added the two game modes well 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.009
 similar to arles because it is a question of 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.020
 race that the first player wins 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.150
 to score the opponent with each 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.130
 game has also demolition which is another 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.840
 the way players start 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.579
 with the best she in the game and each 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:36.030
 success to kill the opponent and will 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:39.000
 receiving the weapons progressively more 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:41.460
 weak until the final challenge with the knife 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.259
 although the offensive global context already 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.240
 be a solid title will not be 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:48.360
 difficult to notice the presence of some 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.610
 borges that decrease the immersion a little 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:54.149
 experience, for example, the fact that 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:57.360
 while reloading the animation 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:59.729
 created there are simply not 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.500
 happens as a result the ditches are 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.270
 recovered automatically without any 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.399
 a sign that this occurred 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.259
 sad, if you are a big fan of 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:09.420
 csa series, it is quite possible that you 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:12.180
 fall in love with global offensive now 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.090
 You've never been a fan of this series that you're after 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.370
 a different game 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:18.000
 in version 1.6 it is better to wait for the 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.000
 next version
