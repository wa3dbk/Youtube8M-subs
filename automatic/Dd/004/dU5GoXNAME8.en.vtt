00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:17.910
 hello all welcome to this second 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.150
 Advice is expensive but to save us 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:23.430
 money today we're going to talk about the 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.650
 rounded corners many times 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:29.430
 we want to turn our corners 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:31.020
 rounded then for cards or pages 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:33.600
 interiors or covers of our 

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:36.360
 albums are mini albums exists in the 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:40.140
 market a machine called corner 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:43.560
 samper and that's fantastic because it's going 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.870
 to do in the corner in the size that 

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:49.230
 we want to cut more materials 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:52.170
 thick but of course she goes over the 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.720
 thirty euros or more then I think 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.540
 I have two tricks that to me 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:01:00.570
 they work very well and in principle 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:02.910
 I have not done in missing this machine the 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.640
 first and the most economical of all are 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.590
 these scissors you see are scissors in 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.680
 wavy shape that you can buy them in 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.600
 bazaars in bookstores that yes the only thing that 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.729
 you have to buy it with the sheet 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.020
 metal because there are plastics and 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:19.000
 those are not worth anything 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:22.689
 well all we have to do is 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.100
 introduce the paper in this part that is 

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:25.810
 sink in does not stand out 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:29.070
 it was outside and so we will have 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:29.070
 our rounded corner 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:35.310
 introduced 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:39.370
 and we cut and we have our corner 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:43.330
 rounded we have to be careful of 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:45.790
 when we cut that we do not get caught 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:48.990
 piece of the part that stands out because 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:48.990
 if this would not happen 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:56.850
 you see we are not rounded yet another 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:02:00.630
 which I usually do with these 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:04.170
 scissors that you can also take advantage of is 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:07.200
 the following I will leave here a link 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:09.750
 so you can see in a project in a 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:13.050
 explosive box that I made as you use 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:18.260
 this trick and it is very cool 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:18.260
 and is the following for example to do 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:24.940
 a title we can write or print 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:28.480
 here and to give it a touch like a little 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:30.190
 more sophisticated because what we do is 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:34.180
 unlike before instead of 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:37.460
 use the area one day we use the 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:41.530
 protruding area and 

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:43.790
 we cut then we have this area 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:46.490
 inward that gives a very 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:49.360
 cool to our little sign I do it to 

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:49.360
 the four corners 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:57.670
 you see and it is then with another air here 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:03:00.010
 a title can then go with a tape 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:04.720
 double-sided sticking on and in the 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:08.739
 second the utensil that I usually 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:12.370
 use a lot I also use them 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:14.230
 DOS vera is the die cutter 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:16.659
 rounded corners that works very 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:19.209
 well it makes a little corner bigger and 

00:03:16.659 --> 00:03:21.400
 it's not very expensive, it's worth it, I think 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:25.090
 between five and six euros you have to 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:28.780
 introduce the good that matches well 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:33.250
 with the right angle that makes the 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:37.659
 machine nothing we press see you make a 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:39.900
 corner also very perfect and that is if 

00:03:37.659 --> 00:03:43.970
 you can compare 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:48.030
 if you see it well it's bigger than it is 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:50.819
 but with both things we would follow very 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:53.239
 well and what would happen if we wanted to cut 

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:53.239
 paperboard 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:00.240
 imagine that you want to make a paste or 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:02.250
 be a cap for your mini or something 

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:07.260
 well and you want to use a cardboard more 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:09.480
 Here, it does not fit, so it's not worth 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:11.530
 can be used but we have our 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:17.450
 saving scissors 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:20.420
 you will see the thing is the following we do 

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:23.390
 the same cut as before and as 

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:26.330
 You see we have burrs here because 

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:30.550
 the cut is not totally clean well 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:30.550
 Well, nothing happens, we take 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:38.229
 a normal and current nail file and what 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:38.229
 The only thing we have to do is polish the 

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:52.740
 as you see problem solved well then 

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:54.750
 I hope you liked this second 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:56.810
 extra tip but if you have 

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:58.980

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:10.710
