able to take a little bit more damage

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.440 
able to take a little bit more damage
this<00:00:54.100> short<00:00:54.940> period<00:00:55.120> of<00:00:55.329> time<00:00:55.390> which<00:00:56.110> he's<00:00:56.440> in

this short period of time which he's in
chicken<00:00:58.450> form<00:00:59.550> so<00:01:00.550> overall<00:01:01.540> this<00:01:02.170> is<00:01:02.230> a<00:01:02.380> good

00:01:02.819 --> 00:01:02.829 
chicken form so overall this is a good

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:04.319 
chicken form so overall this is a good
defensive<00:01:03.340> skill<00:01:03.610> but<00:01:03.790> it's<00:01:03.940> also<00:01:04.089> an

00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:04.329 
defensive skill but it's also an

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:07.410 
defensive skill but it's also an
offensive<00:01:04.899> skill<00:01:05.369> from<00:01:06.369> the<00:01:06.759> additional<00:01:07.240> ten

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:07.420 
offensive skill from the additional ten

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:13.260 
offensive skill from the additional ten
percent<00:01:07.750> damage<00:01:08.909> so<00:01:11.250> strong<00:01:12.250> not<00:01:12.970> the

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:13.270 
percent damage so strong not the

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:15.630 
percent damage so strong not the
strongest<00:01:13.600> skill<00:01:14.110> I<00:01:14.350> prefer<00:01:14.950> other<00:01:15.280> things

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:15.640 
strongest skill I prefer other things

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.670 
strongest skill I prefer other things
but<00:01:16.000> it<00:01:16.330> definitely<00:01:16.659> is<00:01:16.960> this<00:01:17.110> place<00:01:17.320> and<00:01:17.590> can

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:17.680 
but it definitely is this place and can

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.130 
but it definitely is this place and can
be<00:01:17.800> an<00:01:17.860> extremely<00:01:18.040> beneficial<00:01:18.670> skill<00:01:19.270> when

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:20.140

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.130 
popular one by far for the skill as it

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:18.640 
popular one by far for the skill as it
turns<00:03:16.340> into<00:03:16.520> a<00:03:16.670> purely<00:03:17.020> offensive<00:03:18.020> skill<00:03:18.260> as

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
turns into a purely offensive skill as

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:20.470 
turns into a purely offensive skill as
they're<00:03:19.160> able<00:03:19.280> to<00:03:19.490> now<00:03:19.610> take<00:03:19.670> twenty<00:03:20.180> percent

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:20.480 
they're able to now take twenty percent

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.020 
they're able to now take twenty percent
damage<00:03:20.690> rather<00:03:21.170> than<00:03:21.500> just<00:03:22.310> the<00:03:22.430> regular<00:03:22.820> ten

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 
damage rather than just the regular ten

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:28.570 
damage rather than just the regular ten
percent<00:03:23.450> so<00:03:26.650> you<00:03:27.650> can<00:03:27.830> see<00:03:28.040> that<00:03:28.070> they're

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:28.580 
percent so you can see that they're

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:31.270 
percent so you can see that they're
turned<00:03:28.820> into<00:03:29.060> pigs<00:03:29.270> now<00:03:29.600> instead<00:03:30.280> but

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
literally it's the same effectiveness

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:40.270 
literally it's the same effectiveness
it's<00:03:36.650> just<00:03:37.010> now<00:03:37.430> like<00:03:37.790> I<00:03:37.940> said<00:03:38.180> all<00:03:39.280> enemies

my chicken
luckily<00:04:40.100> I<00:04:40.190> was<00:04:40.370> able<00:04:40.490> to<00:04:40.700> dodge<00:04:40.850> the<00:04:41.120> attacks

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:41.420 
luckily I was able to dodge the attacks

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:44.260 
luckily I was able to dodge the attacks
and<00:04:41.690> it<00:04:42.080> does<00:04:42.260> some<00:04:42.500> damage<00:04:42.680> but<00:04:43.270> definitely

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:44.270 
and it does some damage but definitely

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:45.880 
and it does some damage but definitely
not<00:04:44.450> enough<00:04:44.570> damage<00:04:45.080> to<00:04:45.260> warrant<00:04:45.290> the<00:04:45.770> use<00:04:45.860> of

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:45.890 
not enough damage to warrant the use of

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:49.870 
not enough damage to warrant the use of
the<00:04:46.130> skill<00:04:46.400> so<00:04:47.290> one<00:04:48.290> of<00:04:48.320> those<00:04:48.880> corpse

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:49.880 
the skill so one of those corpse

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:52.780 
the skill so one of those corpse
explosions<00:04:50.450> will<00:04:51.380> do<00:04:51.560> more<00:04:51.860> damage<00:04:52.040> than<00:04:52.520> the

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:52.790 
explosions will do more damage than the

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:57.640 
explosions will do more damage than the
chicken<00:04:53.180> does<00:04:53.420> and<00:04:55.870> you're<00:04:56.870> unable<00:04:57.110> to<00:04:57.380> attack

00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:57.650 
chicken does and you're unable to attack

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:02.290 
chicken does and you're unable to attack
or<00:04:58.040> do<00:04:58.220> anything<00:04:58.460> else<00:04:58.930> then<00:05:00.610> so<00:05:01.610> yeah<00:05:01.850> I<00:05:02.060> have

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:02.300 
or do anything else then so yeah I have

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:05.430 
or do anything else then so yeah I have
no<00:05:02.510> idea<00:05:02.780> why<00:05:03.050> this<00:05:03.680> skill<00:05:04.010> is<00:05:04.040> even<00:05:04.460> available

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:05.440 
no idea why this skill is even available

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:10.540 
no idea why this skill is even available
but<00:05:06.440> definitely<00:05:07.070> not<00:05:07.280> a<00:05:09.190> recommended<00:05:10.190> room

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:10.550 
but definitely not a recommended room

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:13.060 
but definitely not a recommended room
choice<00:05:11.410> so<00:05:12.410> the<00:05:12.530> next<00:05:12.650> one<00:05:12.770> is<00:05:12.860> another

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:13.070 
choice so the next one is another

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:15.670 
choice so the next one is another
offensive<00:05:13.550> earned<00:05:13.760> in<00:05:13.970> this<00:05:14.600> case<00:05:14.840> the<00:05:15.440> head

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:15.680 
offensive earned in this case the head

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:17.680 
offensive earned in this case the head
target<00:05:16.130> will<00:05:16.310> bleed<00:05:16.670> for<00:05:17.210> twelve<00:05:17.420> percent

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:17.690 
target will bleed for twelve percent

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:19.930 
target will bleed for twelve percent
weapon<00:05:17.990> damage<00:05:18.140> so<00:05:18.890> this<00:05:19.160> will<00:05:19.340> do<00:05:19.520> a<00:05:19.550> little

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:19.940 
weapon damage so this will do a little

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:26.290 
weapon damage so this will do a little
bit<00:05:20.150> more<00:05:21.220> potential<00:05:22.220> damage<00:05:24.670> so<00:05:25.670> now<00:05:25.880> you<00:05:25.940> see

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:26.300 
bit more potential damage so now you see

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:30.040 
bit more potential damage so now you see
that<00:05:26.830> he's<00:05:27.830> actually<00:05:28.130> going<00:05:28.580> well<00:05:28.930> he<00:05:29.930> was

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:30.050 
that he's actually going well he was

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:31.660 
that he's actually going well he was
going<00:05:30.260> down<00:05:30.410> because<00:05:30.710> of<00:05:30.830> my<00:05:30.920> gargantuan<00:05:31.340> as

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:31.670 
going down because of my gargantuan as

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:37.020 
going down because of my gargantuan as
well<00:05:31.820> but<00:05:32.200> he<00:05:33.200> did<00:05:33.410> take<00:05:33.620> some<00:05:33.680> damage<00:05:34.190> and

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:37.030 

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:39.460 

again<00:05:38.030> another<00:05:38.360> offensive<00:05:39.020> earned<00:05:39.230> choice

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:39.470 
again another offensive earned choice

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:43.510 
again another offensive earned choice
but<00:05:40.360> compared<00:05:41.360> to<00:05:41.450> jinx<00:05:42.080> not<00:05:42.770> as<00:05:42.920> effective<00:05:43.400> in

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:43.520 
but compared to jinx not as effective in

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:53.519 
but compared to jinx not as effective in
my<00:05:43.670> opinion

00:05:53.519 --> 00:05:53.529 

00:05:53.529 --> 00:05:58.989 

unstable<00:05:54.529> form<00:05:55.360> this<00:05:56.360> is<00:05:57.279> does<00:05:58.279> significant

00:05:58.989 --> 00:05:58.999 
unstable form this is does significant

00:05:58.999 --> 00:06:00.969 
unstable form this is does significant
amount<00:05:59.240> of<00:05:59.330> damage<00:05:59.809> if<00:06:00.199> you're<00:06:00.589> killing

00:06:00.969 --> 00:06:00.979 
amount of damage if you're killing

00:06:00.979 --> 00:06:02.320 
amount of damage if you're killing
enemies<00:06:01.279> while<00:06:01.430> they're<00:06:01.610> actually<00:06:02.059> the<00:06:02.180> odds

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:02.330 
enemies while they're actually the odds

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:06.540 
enemies while they're actually the odds
of<00:06:02.629> this<00:06:03.050> triggering<00:06:03.710> significantly<00:06:04.460> is<00:06:04.839> not

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:06.550 
of this triggering significantly is not

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:10.719 
of this triggering significantly is not
going<00:06:07.550> to<00:06:07.639> happen<00:06:07.729> all<00:06:07.999> that<00:06:08.029> often<00:06:08.300> so<00:06:09.729> let's

00:06:10.719 --> 00:06:10.729 
going to happen all that often so let's

00:06:10.729 --> 00:06:16.629 
going to happen all that often so let's
take<00:06:10.939> a<00:06:10.999> look<00:06:11.270> at<00:06:11.419> this<00:06:11.839> so<00:06:12.710> I<00:06:15.430> didn't<00:06:16.430> even<00:06:16.490> see

00:06:16.629 --> 00:06:16.639 
take a look at this so I didn't even see

00:06:16.639 --> 00:06:18.429 
take a look at this so I didn't even see
anybody<00:06:17.120> hexed<00:06:17.419> on<00:06:17.539> that<00:06:17.689> standpoint<00:06:17.990> so

00:06:18.429 --> 00:06:18.439 
anybody hexed on that standpoint so

00:06:18.439 --> 00:06:27.610 
anybody hexed on that standpoint so
let's<00:06:19.279> take<00:06:19.490> a<00:06:19.550> look<00:06:19.759> at<00:06:19.849> one<00:06:19.999> more<00:06:20.059> time<00:06:26.620> all

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:27.620 
let's take a look at one more time all

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:31.019 
let's take a look at one more time all
right<00:06:27.800> so<00:06:28.129> he's<00:06:28.550> turned<00:06:28.819> into<00:06:29.089> a<00:06:29.120> chicken<00:06:29.389> and

00:06:31.019 --> 00:06:31.029 
right so he's turned into a chicken and

00:06:31.029 --> 00:06:34.420 
right so he's turned into a chicken and
I<00:06:32.409> didn't<00:06:33.409> see<00:06:33.529> an<00:06:33.620> explosion<00:06:34.039> or<00:06:34.159> anything

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:34.430 
I didn't see an explosion or anything

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:37.779 
I didn't see an explosion or anything
but<00:06:34.580> he<00:06:34.789> was<00:06:34.909> the<00:06:34.999> only<00:06:35.149> guy<00:06:35.240> left<00:06:35.509> so<00:06:36.789> there's

00:06:37.779 --> 00:06:37.789 
but he was the only guy left so there's

00:06:37.789 --> 00:06:40.869 
but he was the only guy left so there's
not<00:06:38.120> a<00:06:38.449> significant<00:06:39.259> area<00:06:39.589> of<00:06:39.649> effect<00:06:39.879> with

00:06:40.869 --> 00:06:40.879 
not a significant area of effect with

00:06:40.879 --> 00:06:47.310 
not a significant area of effect with
this<00:06:41.120> skill

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:47.320 

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:50.440 

and<00:06:48.320> my<00:06:49.070> chicken<00:06:49.430> was<00:06:49.580> the<00:06:49.820> last<00:06:50.240> guy<00:06:50.420> to

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:50.450 
and my chicken was the last guy to

00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:54.910 
and my chicken was the last guy to
survive<00:06:50.960> so<00:06:53.080> this<00:06:54.080> was<00:06:54.290> not<00:06:54.500> a<00:06:54.530> very<00:06:54.800> good

00:06:54.910 --> 00:06:54.920 
survive so this was not a very good

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:58.270 
survive so this was not a very good
example<00:06:55.880> of<00:06:56.570> showing<00:06:56.960> but<00:06:57.260> it<00:06:57.530> does<00:06:57.800> take<00:06:58.010> some

00:06:58.270 --> 00:06:58.280 
example of showing but it does take some

00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:01.600 
example of showing but it does take some
additional<00:06:58.490> weapon<00:06:58.970> damage<00:06:59.170> so<00:07:00.170> if<00:07:00.380> it's<00:07:00.620> if

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:01.610 
additional weapon damage so if it's if

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:04.600 
additional weapon damage so if it's if
you're<00:07:01.820> dealing<00:07:01.910> with<00:07:02.140> smallpox<00:07:03.460> then<00:07:04.460> it's

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:04.610 
you're dealing with smallpox then it's

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:06.910 
you're dealing with smallpox then it's
beneficial<00:07:05.060> but<00:07:05.480> this<00:07:05.900> skill<00:07:06.350> really<00:07:06.680> shines

00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:06.920 
beneficial but this skill really shines

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:08.440 
beneficial but this skill really shines
when<00:07:07.100> you're<00:07:07.310> dealing<00:07:07.460> with<00:07:07.610> larger<00:07:08.120> enemies

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:08.450 
when you're dealing with larger enemies

00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:11.200 
when you're dealing with larger enemies
and<00:07:09.050> larger<00:07:09.470> packs<00:07:09.710> which<00:07:10.640> is<00:07:10.850> the<00:07:11.030> reason

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:11.210 
and larger packs which is the reason

00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:14.650 
and larger packs which is the reason
that<00:07:11.420> I<00:07:11.870> do<00:07:12.500> not<00:07:12.890> recommend<00:07:13.310> any<00:07:14.000> ruin<00:07:14.480> Joy's
