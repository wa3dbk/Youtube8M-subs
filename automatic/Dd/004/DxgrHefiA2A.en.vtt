was worth enough to justify the
dangerous<00:05:31.479> trade<00:05:31.780> only<00:05:32.229> him<00:05:32.710> sometimes<00:05:33.430> some

00:05:33.809 --> 00:05:33.819 
dangerous trade only him sometimes some

00:05:33.819 --> 00:05:35.580 
dangerous trade only him sometimes some
of<00:05:33.849> the<00:05:33.970> trades<00:05:34.569> you<00:05:34.690> don't<00:05:34.930> make<00:05:35.110> her<00:05:35.319> better

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:35.590 
of the trades you don't make her better

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:37.860 
of the trades you don't make her better
for<00:05:35.860> you<00:05:35.949> than<00:05:36.099> the<00:05:36.160> ones<00:05:36.370> you<00:05:37.180> did<00:05:37.389> make<00:05:37.599> and

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:37.870 
for you than the ones you did make and

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:39.900 
for you than the ones you did make and
even<00:05:37.990> though<00:05:38.229> I<00:05:38.259> like<00:05:38.919> Erik<00:05:39.220> personally<00:05:39.759> and

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:39.910 
even though I like Erik personally and

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:42.110 
even though I like Erik personally and
and<00:05:40.060> thought<00:05:40.660> he<00:05:40.750> was<00:05:40.780> a<00:05:40.930> phenomenal<00:05:41.500> player

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:42.120 
and thought he was a phenomenal player

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:44.730 
and thought he was a phenomenal player
when<00:05:43.120> I<00:05:43.150> look<00:05:43.419> back<00:05:43.449> on<00:05:43.660> it<00:05:43.870> we<00:05:44.440> were<00:05:44.530> much

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:44.740 
when I look back on it we were much

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:48.270 
when I look back on it we were much
better<00:05:45.310> off<00:05:45.490> I<00:05:46.030> think<00:05:46.360> now<00:05:46.990> having<00:05:47.470> not<00:05:48.070> made

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:48.280 
better off I think now having not made

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:48.770 
better off I think now having not made
that

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:48.780 
that

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:51.089 
that
trade<00:05:49.780> or<00:05:49.960> us<00:05:50.080> I<00:05:50.320> don't<00:05:50.380> think<00:05:50.590> we<00:05:50.919> would<00:05:51.070> have

00:05:51.089 --> 00:05:51.099 
trade or us I don't think we would have

00:05:51.099 --> 00:05:55.320 
trade or us I don't think we would have
had<00:05:51.340> the<00:05:52.470> firepower<00:05:53.470> to<00:05:53.800> win<00:05:54.039> in<00:05:54.190> 94<00:05:54.699> I<00:05:54.970> guess

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:55.330 
had the firepower to win in 94 I guess

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:59.700 
had the firepower to win in 94 I guess
both<00:05:55.810> sides<00:05:56.199> won<00:05:56.680> and<00:05:57.070> lost<00:05:57.099> in<00:05:57.699> a<00:05:57.789> way<00:05:58.710> it

00:05:59.700 --> 00:05:59.710 
both sides won and lost in a way it

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:02.730 
both sides won and lost in a way it
didn't<00:06:00.099> help<00:06:00.280> the<00:06:00.880> Nordik<00:06:01.360> that<00:06:01.810> they

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:02.740 
didn't help the Nordik that they

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:05.520 
didn't help the Nordik that they
couldn't<00:06:03.160> land<00:06:03.520> a<00:06:03.729> player<00:06:03.970> like<00:06:04.300> that<00:06:04.330> as<00:06:05.259> I

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:05.530 
couldn't land a player like that as I

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:07.200 
couldn't land a player like that as I
said<00:06:05.740> hard<00:06:05.979> enough<00:06:06.220> to<00:06:06.370> be<00:06:06.490> in<00:06:06.580> a<00:06:06.639> small<00:06:06.970> market

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:07.210 
said hard enough to be in a small market

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:10.680 
said hard enough to be in a small market
and<00:06:07.570> as<00:06:08.380> a<00:06:08.409> fellow<00:06:09.039> owner<00:06:09.340> we<00:06:09.849> want<00:06:10.120> wanted

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:10.690 
and as a fellow owner we want wanted

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:13.680 
and as a fellow owner we want wanted
them<00:06:10.840> to<00:06:10.960> succeed<00:06:11.349> I<00:06:11.560> believe<00:06:11.620> that<00:06:12.449> not<00:06:13.449> being

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:13.690 
them to succeed I believe that not being

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:17.249 
them to succeed I believe that not being
able<00:06:13.900> to<00:06:14.520> attract<00:06:15.520> Erik<00:06:15.970> there<00:06:16.210> had<00:06:16.690> some

00:06:17.249 --> 00:06:17.259 
able to attract Erik there had some

00:06:17.259 --> 00:06:21.089 
able to attract Erik there had some
impact<00:06:17.620> it<00:06:18.250> said<00:06:18.759> I<00:06:19.000> don't<00:06:19.750> blame<00:06:20.050> the<00:06:20.650> move<00:06:20.919> on

00:06:21.089 --> 00:06:21.099 
impact it said I don't blame the move on

00:06:21.099 --> 00:06:23.040 
impact it said I don't blame the move on
Erik<00:06:21.490> in<00:06:21.610> any<00:06:21.759> way<00:06:22.000> to<00:06:22.060> say<00:06:22.389> that<00:06:22.570> was<00:06:22.780> the

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:23.050 
Erik in any way to say that was the

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:24.689 
Erik in any way to say that was the
factor<00:06:23.560> but<00:06:23.800> when<00:06:24.250> something<00:06:24.550> like<00:06:24.580> that

00:06:24.689 --> 00:06:24.699 
factor but when something like that

00:06:24.699 --> 00:06:26.580 
factor but when something like that
happens<00:06:24.880> it<00:06:25.419> just<00:06:25.449> isn't<00:06:25.960> good<00:06:26.110> so<00:06:26.320> ultimately

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:26.590 
happens it just isn't good so ultimately

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:29.399 
happens it just isn't good so ultimately
they<00:06:27.580> had<00:06:27.789> to<00:06:27.940> move<00:06:28.120> but<00:06:28.539> the<00:06:28.690> deal<00:06:28.900> they<00:06:29.169> made

00:06:29.399 --> 00:06:29.409 
they had to move but the deal they made

00:06:29.409 --> 00:06:33.469 
they had to move but the deal they made
with<00:06:30.370> us<00:06:30.610> enable<00:06:31.539> Colorado<00:06:32.080> to<00:06:33.009> win

00:06:33.469 --> 00:06:33.479 
with us enable Colorado to win

00:06:33.479 --> 00:06:37.140 
with us enable Colorado to win
unfortunately<00:06:34.479> for<00:06:35.639> various<00:06:36.639> reasons

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:37.150 
unfortunately for various reasons

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:40.620 
unfortunately for various reasons
including<00:06:37.860> concussions<00:06:38.860> Erik<00:06:39.310> was<00:06:40.090> not<00:06:40.270> able

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:40.630 
including concussions Erik was not able

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:43.560 
including concussions Erik was not able
to<00:06:40.810> fulfill<00:06:41.800> the<00:06:42.340> total<00:06:42.699> promise<00:06:43.120> that<00:06:43.300> he<00:06:43.360> had

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:43.570 
to fulfill the total promise that he had

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:47.370 
to fulfill the total promise that he had
so<00:06:44.560> I<00:06:44.590> don't<00:06:44.949> regret<00:06:45.130> the<00:06:45.460> deal<00:06:45.699> but<00:06:46.690> in<00:06:47.050> the

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:47.380 
so I don't regret the deal but in the

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:52.529 
so I don't regret the deal but in the
end<00:06:47.560> he<00:06:48.389> he<00:06:49.389> just<00:06:49.719> didn't<00:06:50.409> quite<00:06:51.300> maintain<00:06:52.300> the

00:06:52.529 --> 00:06:52.539 
end he he just didn't quite maintain the

00:06:52.539 --> 00:06:54.060 
end he he just didn't quite maintain the
standard<00:06:52.990> he<00:06:53.080> set<00:06:53.320> when<00:06:53.530> he<00:06:53.590> won<00:06:53.740> the<00:06:53.889> Hart

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:54.070 
standard he set when he won the Hart

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:55.920 
standard he set when he won the Hart
Trophy<00:06:54.130> and<00:06:54.580> it<00:06:54.669> looked<00:06:54.880> like<00:06:54.940> we<00:06:55.539> had<00:06:55.690> made

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:55.930 
Trophy and it looked like we had made

00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:57.600 
Trophy and it looked like we had made
the<00:06:56.080> right<00:06:56.259> deal<00:06:56.530> and<00:06:56.949> I<00:06:56.979> just<00:06:57.190> like<00:06:57.310> to<00:06:57.430> say

00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:57.610 
the right deal and I just like to say

00:06:57.610 --> 00:06:59.730 
the right deal and I just like to say
thank<00:06:58.570> you<00:06:58.659> to<00:06:58.750> the<00:06:58.840> fans<00:06:59.020> in<00:06:59.169> Philadelphia

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:20.560 
it was exciting with the Legion of Doom
line<00:07:18.140> but<00:07:18.890> then<00:07:19.130> in<00:07:19.400> a<00:07:19.520> sense<00:07:19.760> we<00:07:20.000> lost<00:07:20.270> because

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:20.570 
line but then in a sense we lost because

00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:22.450
