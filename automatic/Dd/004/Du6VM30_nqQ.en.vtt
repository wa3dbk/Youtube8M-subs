00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
separated so I have copper on this brush

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.740 
separated so I have copper on this brush
and<00:00:33.750> copper<00:00:34.289> in<00:00:34.440> this<00:00:34.620> can<00:00:35.480> just<00:00:36.480> going<00:00:36.690> to

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
and copper in this can just going to

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.870 
and copper in this can just going to
paint<00:00:37.020> it<00:00:37.260> on<00:00:37.520> this<00:00:38.520> little<00:00:38.850> piece<00:00:39.090> here

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:40.880 
paint it on this little piece here

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:46.220 
paint it on this little piece here
let<00:00:41.880> that<00:00:42.090> dry<00:00:43.430> here's<00:00:44.430> my<00:00:44.670> iron<00:00:44.910> brush<00:00:45.480> so

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
let that dry here's my iron brush so

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.229 
let that dry here's my iron brush so
again<00:00:46.620> I'm<00:00:46.980> just<00:00:47.040> going<00:00:47.520> to<00:00:47.550> paint<00:00:47.880> the<00:00:48.030> iron

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
again I'm just going to paint the iron

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:53.459 
again I'm just going to paint the iron
all<00:00:49.140> over<00:00:50.100> this<00:00:50.309> piece

00:00:53.459 --> 00:00:53.469 

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:55.650 

and<00:00:53.739> I<00:00:54.070> wanted<00:00:54.399> to<00:00:54.460> do<00:00:54.760> this<00:00:54.969> first<00:00:55.300> because

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:55.660 
and I wanted to do this first because

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:58.650 
and I wanted to do this first because
the<00:00:56.079> patina<00:00:56.469> takes<00:00:56.859> a<00:00:57.039> little<00:00:57.309> time<00:00:57.699> to<00:00:58.269> react

00:00:58.650 --> 00:00:58.660 
the patina takes a little time to react

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
the patina takes a little time to react
so<00:00:59.079> now<00:00:59.769> here's<00:01:00.160> the<00:01:00.399> patina<00:01:00.989> this<00:01:01.989> works<00:01:02.379> on

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:02.680 
so now here's the patina this works on

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:05.369 
so now here's the patina this works on
both<00:01:02.920> the<00:01:03.159> copper<00:01:03.699> and<00:01:04.330> just<00:01:04.540> spraying<00:01:05.019> it<00:01:05.199> on

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:05.379 
both the copper and just spraying it on

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:08.340 
both the copper and just spraying it on
and<00:01:05.830> the<00:01:06.040> iron<00:01:06.450> so<00:01:07.450> I'm<00:01:07.540> going<00:01:07.690> to<00:01:07.750> have<00:01:07.930> to<00:01:08.080> let

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:08.350 
and the iron so I'm going to have to let

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:10.560 
and the iron so I'm going to have to let
that<00:01:08.560> dry<00:01:08.979> and<00:01:09.400> then<00:01:09.460> we'll<00:01:09.880> come<00:01:10.119> back<00:01:10.149> to

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:10.570 
that dry and then we'll come back to

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:12.810 
that dry and then we'll come back to
those<00:01:10.780> and<00:01:11.049> you'll<00:01:11.170> see<00:01:11.440> how<00:01:11.649> it<00:01:11.830> miraculously

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:12.820 
those and you'll see how it miraculously

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:14.670 
those and you'll see how it miraculously
changes<00:01:13.509> color<00:01:13.810> because<00:01:14.259> it's<00:01:14.440> actually

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:14.680 
changes color because it's actually

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:18.149 
changes color because it's actually
rusting<00:01:15.580> the<00:01:15.940> metal<00:01:16.600> so<00:01:17.409> here's<00:01:17.799> a<00:01:17.860> necklace

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:18.159 
rusting the metal so here's a necklace

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:21.810 
rusting the metal so here's a necklace
made<00:01:18.729> out<00:01:18.940> of<00:01:19.270> a<00:01:19.450> similar<00:01:20.020> piece<00:01:20.380> and<00:01:20.799> in<00:01:21.670> the

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:21.820 
made out of a similar piece and in the

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:23.820 
made out of a similar piece and in the
class<00:01:22.119> we're<00:01:22.600> going<00:01:22.720> to<00:01:22.780> actually<00:01:22.990> mold<00:01:23.500> our

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:23.830 
class we're going to actually mold our

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:26.790 
class we're going to actually mold our
own<00:01:24.039> faces<00:01:24.490> out<00:01:25.060> of<00:01:25.180> the<00:01:25.330> epoxy<00:01:25.780> clay<00:01:26.320> which<00:01:26.649> is

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:26.800 
own faces out of the epoxy clay which is

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.219 
own faces out of the epoxy clay which is
the<00:01:26.950> best<00:01:27.190> for<00:01:27.490> this<00:01:27.610> process<00:01:28.330> then<00:01:29.020> we're

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:29.229 
the best for this process then we're

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:31.550 
the best for this process then we're
going<00:01:29.350> to<00:01:29.380> paint<00:01:29.770> all<00:01:30.039> of<00:01:30.220> our<00:01:30.399> pieces<00:01:30.729> and

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
going to paint all of our pieces and

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.649 
going to paint all of our pieces and
pretend<00:01:32.560> them<00:01:32.920> to<00:01:33.100> watch<00:01:33.310> them<00:01:33.610> dry<00:01:33.880> now<00:01:34.479> let

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:34.659

00:01:42.779 --> 00:01:42.789 
can see I did him with iron and I did

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:45.450 
can see I did him with iron and I did
the<00:01:42.940> actually<00:01:43.509> gourd<00:01:43.810> actual<00:01:44.649> gourd<00:01:45.069> bowl

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:45.460 
the actually gourd actual gourd bowl

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.300 
the actually gourd actual gourd bowl
with<00:01:46.000> the<00:01:46.030> copper<00:01:46.810> so<00:01:47.560> they<00:01:47.740> turn<00:01:48.009> different

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:48.310 
with the copper so they turn different

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:51.389 
with the copper so they turn different
colors<00:01:49.020> here's<00:01:50.020> a<00:01:50.140> little<00:01:50.470> journal<00:01:51.009> cover

00:01:51.389 --> 00:01:51.399

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
one I did the opposite on this one I did

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.530 
one I did the opposite on this one I did
iron<00:02:10.599> on<00:02:11.050> the<00:02:11.170> background<00:02:11.800> and<00:02:12.190> I<00:02:12.730> did<00:02:13.000> copper

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
iron on the background and I did copper

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.809 
iron on the background and I did copper
on<00:02:13.780> the<00:02:13.959> little<00:02:14.260> face<00:02:14.560> so<00:02:14.980> those<00:02:15.220> colors<00:02:15.640> are

00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:15.819
