00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
guess and then would say i think i got

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.410 
guess and then would say i think i got
like<00:00:34.290> not<00:00:34.890> even<00:00:35.040> any<00:00:35.250> room<00:00:35.550> chains<00:00:35.910> the<00:00:36.180> stands

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
like not even any room chains the stands
