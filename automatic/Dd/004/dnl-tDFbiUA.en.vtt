00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:28.029
 every combustion generates the formation of residues that always have effects 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:32.009
 negative on the working methods and on the degree of effectiveness of an engine 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:40.280
 especially the residues in the area of ​​the ring retention rings 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.600
 scraper and their grooves 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.600
 cause a decrease in compression 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.720
 it has worsened the combustion of the fuel air mixture 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:51.610
 it is 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:54.390
 causes a decrease in performance 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.740
 consequently it increases oil and fuel consumption 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.840
 this causes too much of the residues of the 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:03.890
 combustion 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.450
 on the other side of the too high values ​​of unloaded castri 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:10.479
 in addition to the acceleration and wear of the engines 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.520
 some parts of the mixture and vega star combustion evaporate in the 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.660
 engine crankcase accelerating oil aging and can 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.359
 cause damage to the operation of the vent in the basement itself 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.580
 you would like more consistent impurities like traces of hardened resin in the 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:40.900
 oil lines 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:44.229
 I can build the lubrication of important elements 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:46.230
 such as the camshaft 

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:49.880
 but sirignano these impurities with a normal oil change 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:53.920
 for a better clarification let's take another look inside the 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:55.470
 engine stand 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.380
 at a normal oil change the old olive tree is discharged 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.950
 however, by discharging the old oil we do not get rid of all the impurities 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:07.990
 linked to the service a part remains in the form of a deposit in the circuit 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:11.409
 oil and lubrication 

00:02:11.409 --> 00:02:15.029
 to the new filling of the engine with the fresh and clean and to the restart 

00:02:15.029 --> 00:02:19.849
 the new oil I take in the remaining residues they harris laps in the turn of 

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:22.569
 very short time 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:27.069
 its naturally negative effects on the performance of the new black 

00:02:27.649 --> 00:02:31.409
 to keep both the performance and economy of combustion engines high 

00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:35.879
 inside we advise you to carry out the cleaning before every oil change 

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:38.879
 of all the oil the lubrication circuit 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:44.489
 after adding the old oil our purifier the motor must be operated 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:46.060
 with an empty run 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:47.979
 10 15 minutes 

00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:52.179
 in this time dreams and all the molecules of dirt accumulated during 

00:02:52.179 --> 00:02:55.879
 the operation as here we can see in some areas particularly 

00:02:55.879 --> 00:02:57.999
 delicate 

00:02:57.999 --> 00:03:00.859
 these are for example 

00:03:00.859 --> 00:03:03.859
 the area of ​​the retaining rings 

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:08.379
 the area of ​​the Salento Elba vent 

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:16.599
 and the camshaft lubrication zone 

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:20.730
 at the same time, highly lubricated components protect the motor 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:23.239
 during the entire cleaning process 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:27.709
 elastomeric and washers of sealing joints come 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:30.309
 kept pasty 

00:03:30.309 --> 00:03:33.449
 all the impurities are removed from the old olive tree 

00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:39.239
 in this way we get a new lions of a very clean lubrication circuit 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:42.239
 yarin I love you with fresh new lyon 

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:48.959
 only now in the clean environment the new wolf offer in an optimal way 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:52.949
 its features and meet lubrication needs 

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:54.349
 waterproof 

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:57.349
 cool off by retaining the particles 

00:04:00.119 --> 00:04:03.650
 I want to do now discovering new important deliveries 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:07.329
 and the old residues are no longer limited in its performance 

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:12.369
 therefore our result 

00:04:12.369 --> 00:04:15.369
 fresh oil the new in a clean engine 

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:19.259
 optimal fuel oil consumption 

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:22.129
 an improved engine performance 

00:04:22.129 --> 00:04:24.650
 - engine wear 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:26.680
 - gaseous emissions 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:29.050
 he longer life of the catalyst
