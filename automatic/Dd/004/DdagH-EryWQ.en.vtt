00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.609 
much but on this new account I'm going
through<00:01:05.909> the<00:01:06.180> 12th<00:01:06.540> actually<00:01:07.080> relative<00:01:07.530> to

through the 12th actually relative to

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.080 
through the 12th actually relative to
12,000<00:01:08.220> fifa<00:01:08.430> points<00:01:08.549> i'm<00:01:08.729> not<00:01:08.850> quite<00:01:09.030> sure

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
12,000 fifa points i'm not quite sure

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.300 
12,000 fifa points i'm not quite sure
where<00:01:09.630> it<00:01:09.810> exactly<00:01:10.260> stacks<00:01:10.619> up<00:01:10.860> but<00:01:11.040> more<00:01:11.189> or

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
where it exactly stacks up but more or

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.000 
where it exactly stacks up but more or
less<00:01:11.490> that<00:01:11.850> is<00:01:12.030> my<00:01:12.210> theory<00:01:12.540> that<00:01:12.869> you<00:01:13.260> if<00:01:13.770> you

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
less that is my theory that you if you

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.950 
less that is my theory that you if you
have<00:01:14.189> loads<00:01:14.640> of<00:01:14.909> cliff<00:01:15.180> you<00:01:15.270> have<00:01:15.390> a<00:01:15.420> huge<00:01:15.659> Club

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
have loads of cliff you have a huge Club

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.249 
have loads of cliff you have a huge Club
value<00:01:16.350> and<00:01:16.759> loads<00:01:17.759> of<00:01:17.909> wins<00:01:18.150> on<00:01:18.450> your<00:01:19.110> main

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
value and loads of wins on your main

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.820 
value and loads of wins on your main
account<00:01:19.670> maybe<00:01:20.670> go<00:01:21.030> ahead<00:01:21.180> and<00:01:21.390> give<00:01:21.720> the<00:01:21.990> give

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
account maybe go ahead and give the give

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.219 
account maybe go ahead and give the give
the<00:01:22.860> second<00:01:23.490> account<00:01:24.000> a<00:01:24.180> try<00:01:24.479> we<00:01:24.990> pulled

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
the second account a try we pulled

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.710 
the second account a try we pulled
khushi<00:01:25.799> yelling<00:01:26.250> me<00:01:26.369> up<00:01:26.580> that<00:01:27.060> first<00:01:27.299> pack<00:01:27.570> we

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
khushi yelling me up that first pack we

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.499 
khushi yelling me up that first pack we
pulled<00:01:27.960> mod<00:01:28.259> rich<00:01:28.579> this<00:01:29.579> second<00:01:30.060> pack<00:01:30.210> which

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
pulled mod rich this second pack which

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.319 
pulled mod rich this second pack which
on<00:01:30.900> a<00:01:30.930> normal<00:01:31.350> day<00:01:31.560> you'd<00:01:32.159> probably<00:01:32.700> be<00:01:33.119> pretty

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
on a normal day you'd probably be pretty

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.140 
on a normal day you'd probably be pretty
happy<00:01:33.630> with<00:01:33.930> well<00:01:34.619> maybe<00:01:35.430> not<00:01:35.640> a<00:01:35.700> normal<00:01:35.880> day

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
happy with well maybe not a normal day

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.749 
happy with well maybe not a normal day
let's<00:01:36.720> let's<00:01:36.990> look<00:01:37.079> at<00:01:37.229> it<00:01:37.320> this<00:01:37.409> way<00:01:37.470> two

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:37.759 
let's let's look at it this way two

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:40.929 
let's let's look at it this way two
packs<00:01:38.759> get<00:01:39.090> gradually<00:01:39.720> worse<00:01:39.960> and<00:01:40.229> worse<00:01:40.380> as

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:40.939 
packs get gradually worse and worse as

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:43.670 
packs get gradually worse and worse as
ultimate<00:01:41.939> team<00:01:42.150> goes<00:01:42.479> on<00:01:42.750> now<00:01:43.140> this<00:01:43.619> is

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
ultimate team goes on now this is
