it's called a quad speed as Todd Pagal

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.750 
it's called a quad speed as Todd Pagal
explains<00:00:21.620> basically<00:00:22.620> it's<00:00:22.740> a<00:00:22.830> high<00:00:23.490> speed

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
explains basically it's a high speed

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.880 
explains basically it's a high speed
sports<00:00:24.090> and<00:00:24.270> fibia<00:00:24.450> what<00:00:25.170> it<00:00:25.290> does<00:00:25.470> is<00:00:25.650> it<00:00:25.740> goes

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
sports and fibia what it does is it goes

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.210 
sports and fibia what it does is it goes
on<00:00:26.340> water<00:00:26.640> and<00:00:26.880> on<00:00:27.360> land<00:00:27.500> and<00:00:28.500> it<00:00:28.620> transitions

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
on water and on land and it transitions

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.670 
on water and on land and it transitions
in<00:00:29.490> four<00:00:29.730> seconds<00:00:30.120> between<00:00:30.480> the<00:00:30.600> two<00:00:30.780> it<00:00:31.530> goes

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:31.680 
in four seconds between the two it goes

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:34.849 
in four seconds between the two it goes
45<00:00:32.009> miles<00:00:32.369> per<00:00:32.640> hour<00:00:32.759> on<00:00:33.000> each<00:00:33.360> water<00:00:34.230> and<00:00:34.530> land

00:00:34.849 --> 00:00:34.859 
45 miles per hour on each water and land

00:00:34.859 --> 00:00:38.060 
45 miles per hour on each water and land
so<00:00:35.609> basically<00:00:35.940> it's<00:00:36.210> a<00:00:36.420> watercraft<00:00:37.260> an<00:00:37.530> ATV

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
so basically it's a watercraft an ATV

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.450 
so basically it's a watercraft an ATV
combined<00:00:38.929> but<00:00:39.929> it's<00:00:40.079> a<00:00:40.440> lot<00:00:40.829> more<00:00:41.190> than<00:00:41.249> just

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
combined but it's a lot more than just

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.209 
combined but it's a lot more than just
an<00:00:42.329> even<00:00:42.809> a<00:00:42.870> lot<00:00:42.989> of<00:00:43.019> death

because of the little heavier a little

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:29.040 
because of the little heavier a little
wider<00:01:27.369> it's<00:01:27.670> a<00:01:27.759> lot<00:01:27.909> more<00:01:28.090> stable<00:01:28.330> it's

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:29.050 
wider it's a lot more stable it's
