00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:10.150
 zona valverde verona nicolò è barbara manage restaurant between risotto is in 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:13.760
 via poland a cross of wave have maybe a little hard to find 

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:15.910
 restaurants in the small but well cared for 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:20.480
 and he prepared us some very interesting recipes yes first rionero ramp 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:23.279
 with clams and marinated tomatoes 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.810
 here then from the skin - neo is produced here at home because the pasta is the source. to 

00:00:27.809 --> 00:00:28.749
 you here 

00:00:28.749 --> 00:00:33.359
 and they came because to the sepia that is a pigment therefore it doesn't have 

00:00:33.359 --> 00:00:36.610
 absolutely no calories than from this typical color 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:39.740
 or. a vast one that saves the cuttlefish to hide 

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:41.600
 together there are clams 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:42.970
 of the clams that 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:44.030
 I'm 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:48.920
 buy fresh biciweb then they must be well closed 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.159
 let it strip for a while in the water so that the Nola sand 

00:00:53.159 --> 00:00:53.970
 and then 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:56.070
 he thrown on the web 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.770
 steel table on the house table to check that they are not dead 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:04.270
 therefore they are not full of sand that could give bad taste to the 

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:08.780
 recipe the other very interesting thing that makes nicolò is marinare cherry tomatoes 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.450
 forin save the are very rich in many nutrients 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.880
 and also substances that do our body especially well 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.480
 cardiovascular arena like lycopene 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:22.570
 in the case of tomatoes, they are substances that are just under the skin then 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:26.600
 borini contain more just because they are small and are left 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.110
 marinate a couple of days in one 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:34.830
 films in a compote of oil toast salt and pepper, here the cherry tomatoes injuries 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:36.780
 they are slaughtered and then 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.430
 Tooltip from the blanched oil slightly go to compose the dish 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:42.870
 therefore they give a very particular taste 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:44.530
 it is very rich in tomato 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:48.010
 to this dish of our women 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:50.880
 exclu we distinguish clearly from 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.190
 you copied that could be a second 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:58.470
 the fucking dog is made up of we insert l9 farne 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:00.330
 with baked potatoes and apples 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.090
 and flake the truffle 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.690
 also this year an interesting recipe because the suckling pig is treated in a 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:07.630
 some way 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:11.740
 the infinite is completely degreased completely deprived of tendons 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:15.800
 and then wrapped in a film so that it perfectly retains its shape 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:20.530
 see how it almost makes a salami in this way leaving the refrigerator for a two 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:25.290
 three hours perfectly keeps the washer the shape and therefore it can 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.350
 cook without then the meat takes shapes 

00:02:29.579 --> 00:02:32.859
 - palatable - nice to see on the plate 

00:02:32.859 --> 00:02:35.169
 it is accompanied 

00:02:35.169 --> 00:02:38.950
 the ant license gives a great deal of years later they have though 

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:43.229
 many nutrients emilia lamela goes very well with the meat of 

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:45.389
 pig because of that 

00:02:45.389 --> 00:02:49.169
 that taste the sweetish hexameter and at the same time a stamp that it marries 

00:02:49.169 --> 00:02:49.960
 very well 

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:51.469
 converter 

00:02:51.469 --> 00:02:53.629
 virgilio pork tenderloin 

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:54.860
 to this dish 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:03:00.039
 we have the possibility to combine a large quantity of vegetables but also futa 

00:03:00.039 --> 00:03:01.919
 which we must remember must be 

00:03:01.919 --> 00:03:05.609
 in our diet for at least 5 portions a day 

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:09.620
 we have seasonal fruit is in you we have thought i still have some 

00:03:09.619 --> 00:03:11.999
 fungus even though we are low 

00:03:11.999 --> 00:03:14.899
 the end of autumn alone 

00:03:14.899 --> 00:03:19.109
 this baby and I'm flat can perfectly go and cover ours 

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:22.889
 daily calorie requirement is all the nutrients we need 

00:03:23.429 --> 00:03:27.729
 at the carnaby we will have a red wine in mind because that's what it is 

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:32.309
 accompanies a dish of this type but we must remember that every day 

00:03:32.309 --> 00:03:35.959
 on our table and even between meals a large must be consumed 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:36.659
 amount of milk
