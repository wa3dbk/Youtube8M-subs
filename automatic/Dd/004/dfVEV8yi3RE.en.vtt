00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
see this here this is the point where it

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.240 
see this here this is the point where it
pops<00:00:40.890> up<00:00:41.070> right<00:00:41.129> there<00:00:42.860> and<00:00:43.860> then<00:00:44.040> that's

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
pops up right there and then that's

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.760 
pops up right there and then that's
where<00:00:44.399> it<00:00:44.489> pops<00:00:44.670> up<00:00:45.110> so<00:00:46.110> you're<00:00:46.379> going<00:00:46.500> to<00:00:46.559> hold

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
where it pops up so you're going to hold

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.450 
where it pops up so you're going to hold
here<00:00:48.020> turn<00:00:49.020> it<00:00:49.170> up<00:00:49.289> just<00:00:49.800> say<00:00:50.070> the<00:00:50.100> flaps

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
here turn it up just say the flaps

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:56.479 
here turn it up just say the flaps
facing<00:00:51.449> output<00:00:51.750> push<00:00:52.680> this<00:00:53.750> new<00:00:54.750> spot<00:00:55.050> up<00:00:55.489> hope

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
facing output push this new spot up hope

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:02.240 
facing output push this new spot up hope
your<00:00:56.640> thumb<00:00:59.510> and<00:01:00.510> then<00:01:01.260> you<00:01:01.710> can<00:01:01.890> see<00:01:02.070> this

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
your thumb and then you can see this

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.750 
your thumb and then you can see this
line<00:01:02.550> forming<00:01:03.030> in<00:01:03.210> this<00:01:03.420> line<00:01:03.629> here<00:01:04.760> parts

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
line forming in this line here parts

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:14.510 
line forming in this line here parts
gonna<00:01:05.939> do<00:01:06.450> that<00:01:07.729> sir<00:01:09.140> strain<00:01:10.140> it<00:01:10.290> up

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.389 

and<00:01:15.520> this<00:01:15.700> up<00:01:16.649> and<00:01:17.649> then<00:01:17.710> straighten<00:01:18.250> this

00:01:18.389 --> 00:01:18.399 
and this up and then straighten this

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:25.050 
and this up and then straighten this
line<00:01:18.640> out<00:01:18.820> here<00:01:22.500> well<00:01:23.500> I'm<00:01:23.530> kind<00:01:23.860> of<00:01:23.920> a<00:01:24.130> square

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:25.060 
line out here well I'm kind of a square

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:37.740 
line out here well I'm kind of a square
solid<00:01:25.570> 3d<00:01:26.049> shape<00:01:26.289> here<00:01:29.490> you<00:01:30.490> get<00:01:30.610> that<00:01:36.600> ok<00:01:37.600> now

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:37.750 
solid 3d shape here you get that ok now

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:38.910 
solid 3d shape here you get that ok now
I'm<00:01:37.869> going<00:01:37.899> to<00:01:38.079> give<00:01:38.170> you<00:01:38.259> a<00:01:38.289> closer<00:01:38.530> view<00:01:38.649> in

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:49.420 
can lift it up and there's a see the

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.429 
can lift it up and there's a see the
early<00:01:49.810> line<00:01:50.110> point<00:01:50.380> here<00:01:50.560> turn<00:01:51.159> it<00:01:51.310> up<00:01:51.459> just

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
early line point here turn it up just

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:58.020 
early line point here turn it up just
pitch<00:01:53.439> this<00:01:53.679> hold<00:01:53.979> on<00:01:54.069> to<00:01:54.220> it<00:01:54.659> so<00:01:55.659> ya<00:01:55.810> see<00:01:57.030> and

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.030 
pitch this hold on to it so ya see and

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:00.270 
pitch this hold on to it so ya see and
just<00:01:58.630> ran<00:01:58.840> out<00:01:58.989> this<00:01:59.170> one<00:01:59.349> screen<00:01:59.979> out<00:02:00.130> this

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280 
just ran out this one screen out this

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:05.809 
just ran out this one screen out this
line<00:02:00.489> here<00:02:01.470> you<00:02:02.470> can<00:02:02.590> do<00:02:02.709> that<00:02:02.920> on<00:02:03.099> the<00:02:03.189> bottom

00:02:05.809 --> 00:02:05.819 

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:12.470 

and<00:02:07.259> fold<00:02:08.259> that<00:02:08.500> down<00:02:09.030> strain<00:02:10.030> the<00:02:10.060> lines<00:02:10.360> out

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
and fold that down strain the lines out

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.170 
and fold that down strain the lines out
and<00:02:13.480> still<00:02:13.780> get<00:02:13.900> that<00:02:14.079> shape<00:02:14.290> you<00:02:15.280> from<00:02:16.090> the

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
and still get that shape you from the

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:17.370 
and still get that shape you from the
beginning<00:02:16.269> if<00:02:16.630> you<00:02:16.720> did<00:02:16.900> all<00:02:17.049> your<00:02:17.139> fault

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:17.380 
beginning if you did all your fault

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:19.440 
beginning if you did all your fault
straight<00:02:17.739> it<00:02:17.980> should<00:02:18.190> be<00:02:18.220> very<00:02:18.310> easy<00:02:18.639> to<00:02:19.299> do

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
straight it should be very easy to do

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:32.030 
straight it should be very easy to do
that

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:43.140 

okay<00:02:33.040> just<00:02:33.640> end<00:02:33.910> up<00:02:34.060> with<00:02:34.270> that<00:02:34.450> to<00:02:34.720> the<00:02:34.840> end<00:02:42.150> so

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
okay just end up with that to the end so

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.960 
okay just end up with that to the end so
the<00:02:43.300> next<00:02:43.480> step<00:02:43.660> is<00:02:43.930> due<00:02:44.380> for<00:02:44.650> this<00:02:45.400> triangle

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
the next step is due for this triangle

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:50.510 
the next step is due for this triangle
in<00:02:46.270> here<00:02:46.540> which<00:02:47.050> we<00:02:47.260> made<00:02:47.440> earlier<00:02:47.730> hold<00:02:48.730> it<00:02:48.910> in

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.520 
in here which we made earlier hold it in

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:54.600 
in here which we made earlier hold it in
Hong<00:02:51.520> increases<00:02:52.030> and<00:02:52.860> as<00:02:53.860> you<00:02:54.130> pour<00:02:54.310> that<00:02:54.340> in

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
Hong increases and as you pour that in

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:57.300 
Hong increases and as you pour that in
either<00:02:55.180> bring<00:02:55.480> this<00:02:55.750> half<00:02:56.020> to<00:02:56.860> this<00:02:57.010> point

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
either bring this half to this point

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:03.750 
either bring this half to this point
right<00:02:57.550> here<00:02:59.610> like<00:03:00.610> so<00:03:01.680> then<00:03:02.680> you<00:03:03.010> hold<00:03:03.670> that

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
right here like so then you hold that

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:09.540 
right here like so then you hold that
down<00:03:06.330> and<00:03:07.330> do<00:03:07.540> that<00:03:07.690> all<00:03:07.840> the<00:03:07.900> way<00:03:08.050> around<00:03:08.550> this

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:09.550 
down and do that all the way around this

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:17.820 
down and do that all the way around this
triangle<00:03:09.940> here<00:03:11.970> to<00:03:12.970> this<00:03:13.090> point<00:03:13.360> here<00:03:16.830> I'm

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:17.830 
triangle here to this point here I'm

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:20.850 
triangle here to this point here I'm
going<00:03:17.950> to<00:03:18.040> hold<00:03:18.340> that<00:03:18.400> down<00:03:18.670> I<00:03:19.530> throw<00:03:20.530> down<00:03:20.709> if

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:20.860 
going to hold that down I throw down if

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:49.309 
going to hold that down I throw down if
I<00:03:20.950> after<00:03:21.250> last<00:03:21.459> week<00:03:21.670> oh<00:03:21.850> that<00:03:28.530> one<00:03:29.530> yeah
