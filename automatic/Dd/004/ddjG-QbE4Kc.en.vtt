unfortunately the condition will grow

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.920 
unfortunately the condition will grow
back<00:01:16.830> very<00:01:17.580> aggressive<00:01:18.330> as<00:01:18.450> a<00:01:18.479> matter<00:01:18.720> of<00:01:18.810> fact

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930

and believe it or not during those two
surgeries<00:01:23.909> she<00:01:24.420> was<00:01:24.570> almost<00:01:24.750> killed<00:01:25.229> from<00:01:25.530> it

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
surgeries she was almost killed from it

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.460 
surgeries she was almost killed from it
twice<00:01:26.369> now<00:01:27.030> currently<00:01:27.420> she<00:01:27.659> wants<00:01:27.960> to<00:01:28.049> go<00:01:28.200> for
