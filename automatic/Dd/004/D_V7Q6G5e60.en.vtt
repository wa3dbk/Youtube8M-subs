00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:27.410
 and so hello to all friends you fight you 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:30.430
 watch my channel on youtube and before 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:33.410
 you motorcycle zongshen zs 200 2008 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:36.050
 don't be scared by the look of the bike 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:40.910
 absolutely on the go and moreover its 110 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:44.000
 120 he goes clear a little bit 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:44.540
 tricks with butter with this we his 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.129
 disassembled 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:51.589
 now this problem is fixed simply 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:54.020
 I want to show you can be someone 

00:00:51.589 --> 00:00:55.160
 it will be useful to mean something like this 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:59.690
 Firstly 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:02.899
 changed salenblok oh gland excuse me 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:05.570
 gland of this gearbox shaft 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:06.289
 the second gland is exactly the same little 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:08.600
 other size 

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:11.270
 is under this star we are with a star 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.340
 removed also changed perry extruded 2 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.320
 omentum 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:18.020
 the third question I will probably show like this 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:19.550
 will see it done in the plan 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.020
 prevention here she did not flow on 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:23.750
 just in terms of prevention already 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:27.409
 complex nicks we decided to change here 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:29.270
 there is a gasket head gasket 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:31.700
 completely dry that is like a valve 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:36.740
 cover or sorry but the gasket 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:40.369
 heads just a little slobbering say 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:43.329
 so a little drooling over here 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:52.009
 this gasket which is around 

00:01:43.329 --> 00:01:52.460
 around the generator now I'll show in 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:59.119
 separate 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:02:03.140
 and so here you see the rotor it comes 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:05.619
 about this gasket which is under 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:08.899
 here is this rebar generator cover 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:11.450
 she was worn out in one place in my opinion 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:14.209
 somewhere here I don't remember exactly and we 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:17.019
 Of course, and she ordered as soon 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:21.860
 will come we will gather back and 

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:24.280
 actually all things here so that 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:27.640
 So it goes 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:30.949
 waiting for this gasket 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:33.590
 head off put a few 

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:35.300
 gaskets ordered immediately leave everything 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:38.769
 laying we put the second laying under 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:42.340
 generator this whole thing back collect 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:45.170
 the seals we have already changed and therefore 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:47.660
 the problem with the leak should no longer be 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:49.220
 although it flowed not so much she 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:51.080
 just slightly there for baiting the shaft 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:54.319
 drop by drop that is not 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.920
 critical but at the same time it is not 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:58.129
 right 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:00.310
 and we of course have this problem fast 

00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:00.310
 eliminate 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:49.830
 such an enzyme stopped here 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:51.670
 there we and random missed flew away she 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:56.230
 deep deep 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:04:08.760
 will again have to disassemble the cylinder 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:08.760
 in a new way, but here the small one flew away 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:24.460
 when installing it is advisable not to let it go 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:29.889
 until you make sure that she has become her 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:35.910
 place like i will disassemble by new 

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:35.910
 motor but not all motor chop up well 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:47.580
 here everything is collected back here are these strains 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:54.040
 2 received which flew from me 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:05:01.870
 rather, one flew away now I will play 

00:04:54.040 --> 00:05:08.260
 to set the rocker seat and cover 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:13.320
 cover it all almost all collected 

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:17.889
 left to congratulate the valve cover 

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:20.220
 pour oil well, and you can put tanks 

00:05:17.889 --> 00:05:20.220
 little by little 

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:26.169
 start up 

00:05:22.669 --> 00:05:26.169
 see what happened 

00:05:43.969 --> 00:05:48.930
 there you have it friends 

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:52.230
 subscribe to the channel put likes 

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:55.760
 There will be many useful vidyashek all 

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:55.760
 all successful season 2015
