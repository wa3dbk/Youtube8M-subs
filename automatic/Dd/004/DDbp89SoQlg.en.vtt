00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 hello let's try with 10 take 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.980
 write down my conclusions regarding 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:10.620
 use of this knife here can be 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.389
 You recognized him. This is a bedroom for Windows 4; 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.530
 a little bit unusual because in his 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.980
 some designs have been made 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.960
 changes they touched the handle i am now 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.699
 we have here 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.240
 magically missing steel 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.300
 liners 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.070
 and the overlays are made of g10 on the other 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.619
 there is such a texture 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.300
 decorative inserts of selenite which 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.780
 above, I understand that flooded 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:38.219
 epoxy and spacer is also very similar 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:40.290
 sincerely there, well, then the conclusions will be 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.940
 touch really more exactly 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.710
 constructive changes and 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.059
 design features that 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.840
 acquired this m2 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:50.280
 due to these changes since 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.949
 operating plan 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.140
 I did not feel any differences 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.870
 wore this knife on the pocket and in view of 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.820
 that its dimensions in some way 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.420
 defines it let's say so area 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.340
 of application 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.460
 I am talking about these dimensions 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:08.729
 there is a thin handle that will not 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.470
 very convenient to do hard work in 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.960
 overall she makes this knife very 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.240
 good in terms of wearing comfort 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:19.380
 application of 10 auger long blade 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:22.080
 lightweight super I dragged that spoon 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:26.430
 weeks performed exclusively office 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.869
 work and in principle there is logical 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.619
 suggest that they are no different 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.390
 have felt 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.729
 let's look at what 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:36.210
 changed will compare with spider to 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:40.710
 endura 4 variations descents from the middle 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:44.090
 blade and Emerson wave ovsky and such here 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:47.850
 spider who treat you in one of mine 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:51.360
 most like to say it 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:53.700
 natural our probably so in the first 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.720
 all that we feel immediately when 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.579
 take this knife in your hand 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:00.810
 this is what the blade stroke here is not the same 

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:02.729
 due to the fact that this time the blade 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.460
 have to touch directly 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:07.619
 with dice from g10 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.660
 as I understand it, and I assume that friction 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.420
 in these dies somewhat higher than 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.610
 friction 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:15.220
 have steel liners well god bless him 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:17.349
 the blade is essentially the same 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:20.730
 elevators yes because they are here 

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:23.530
 Precisely measure postpone nasty an axial node 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:26.590
 with the same elevators blade can 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:29.040
 throw away quickly not so much 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:31.270
 ways to do it on 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.780
 ordinary dope yes so we can do 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:34.270
 this 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:36.819
 third finger some wild ones 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:38.530
 shaking yes and so on don't mind on 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:40.900
 do it depending on how much here 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:45.250
 mechanics she is already shabby and here everything 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:46.959
 just fine here but move 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:48.790
 somewhat tighter though again 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:51.340
 if you loosen slightly and axial then i 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:55.299
 I think that something similar can be obtained 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:57.299
 on the other hand, the backlash is vertical 

00:02:55.299 --> 00:03:00.100
 present as far as i can 

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:03.040
 try your injured hands 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:06.340
 my hands are injured at once both 1 i dont 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:08.230
 content here but enduro again 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:11.530
 with such dimensions, I believe that this 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:15.160
 backlash especially given the purpose 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:16.840
 knife he is quite admissible here and here 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.500
 no critical moments again 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:20.640
 I do not see 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:22.810
 plus the whole thing is a backlog from spider to and 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:23.280
 he has the same feature 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:25.900
 to play 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.340
 By the way I will tell you about my impressions of 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:30.190
 last endure which is basically 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:32.920
 I held in my hands all the play 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:35.260
 unfortunately i have tried 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:37.480
 let's say the old party about shreds 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:42.250
 at least 100 rents there is no such 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:43.390
 It was about the horizontal backlash 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:46.030
 again 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:48.760
 You can shake it all, especially with 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:51.579
 addiction with which I do here 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:54.310
 but here again no problem i'm not 

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:58.390
 I think this is a critical indicator in 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:04:01.480
 plan how the lock hold the knife and blade 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:03.370
 open again i'm not 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:03.850
 supporter of the need for this knife 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:06.940
 knock 

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:09.700
 butt because it's stupid this knife for 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:12.370
 other tasks not for hard work he 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:14.500
 declared as tactical go further 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:15.790
 to deal with the following 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.320
 features we need 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:21.730
 measuring tools 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:26.740
 Yes, such scales are what we will now 

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:28.060
 we will actually do now 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:32.380
 weigh first 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:34.840
 ordinary well, we have it with a heavy blade 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:37.300
 it weighs 100 33 grams hope you 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:38.710
 it is clear that in general is not bad 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:40.450
 the results I can say that here 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:42.280
 exactly in this enduro version already 

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:43.870
 horseradish feel on the pocket that is you 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:46.110
 periodically fly there hand to 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:51.639
 check if you have lost your knife and 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:53.650
 try matriarch 100 grams exactly 

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:55.360
 there is a situation a little better by the way here 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:57.610
 ironically but when you take these two 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:59.680
 clicking a hand for some reason maybe this is on 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:02.620
 effect on let's say at the level 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:05.380
 This installation is necessary to sid about with 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:09.250
 heavier than 3 grams difference and now 

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:12.580
 enduro drum roll without steel 

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:14.910
 liners weighs 82 and a half grams here 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:20.050
 this is a good result I think yes 

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:25.240
 in fact in essence here let's say this 

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:28.510
 a situation which is not the best enemy of the good 

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:30.460
 that's for sure since you can have 

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:33.039
 light knife can have a very light knife 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:35.020
 the lighter the knife and without loss 

00:05:33.039 --> 00:05:38.160
 some kind of constructive 

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:40.389
 strength properties so much the better that 

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:42.970
 let's talk about this 

00:05:40.389 --> 00:05:44.889
 talk about the elasticity of the material for 

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:48.580
 of this we take enduro and again 

00:05:44.889 --> 00:05:50.080
 we can try to press it a little 

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:51.669
 see if try very hard and 

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:54.010
 right now I can not do it due to the fact that 

00:05:51.669 --> 00:05:57.280
 me both thigh joints knocked out 

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:58.950
 here but as far as I can in fact 

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:02.979
 things almost get in touch with these 

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:05.970
 Flags house with a friend however I 

00:06:02.979 --> 00:06:08.919
 I think that here on this kind on this same 

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:10.599
 excess strength well believe me not 

00:06:08.919 --> 00:06:13.050
 know what to do to break 

00:06:10.599 --> 00:06:16.090
 this knife is exactly in that direction 

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:17.680
 further looking actually the situation 

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:20.350
 absolutely the same i mean i 

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:23.530
 put effort and voila 

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:27.910
 beach liners let's see what we 

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:29.470
 can offer g10 and g10 we have horseradish 

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:31.660
 get to push because he 

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:35.650
 much more let's say it's easier to bend 

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:38.980
 material and were the same thickness at 

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:40.680
 much smaller weight this knife saves 

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:43.540
 absolutely the same strength properties 

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:45.750
 so I think that this is an absolute wine. 

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:48.190
 All the more so given the fact that 

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:51.040
 such a production knife will cost more 

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:54.040
 cheaper if earlier we had say so 

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:56.440
 the knife is allowed with this classic knife 

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:59.350
 see all that we can have this 

00:06:56.440 --> 00:07:01.140
 knife them for the same let's say the same with the same 

00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:02.680
 properties but for much less money 

00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:07.830
 here is my opinion 

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:10.530
 so cheer advise everyone and so on 

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:12.900
 further this knife will go on its way 

00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:15.780
 almost the golden ring 

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:18.250
 Probably the next one is going through the ground 

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:20.410
 let's see what the next owners say 

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:25.290
 Well, thank you for watching. I hope 

00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:25.290
 It was interesting to everyone good luck for now
