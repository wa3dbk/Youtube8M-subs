00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:08.820
 hi all guys in this new one 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.280
 video in collaboration with the site 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.469
 bamboo I'll tell you about the red pulleys that 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.900
 see in the video itself 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:19.320
 this article is available on the site 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:21.449
 ban gould and find it by clicking on 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.650
 link that you find in the description of 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.080
 video itself 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.210
 in practice if you click on that link 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.269
 you will discover that an app reads of these 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.460
 it costs 2 euros 85 then sent with 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.469
 shipping included from the warehouse in China 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.350
 while at the warehouse of the united kingdom 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:39.270
 they cost 4 euros and 60 moon so anyway 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.430
 if you are not in a hurry to advise 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.110
 clearly to take it from stock 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.899
 in china because they cost less 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.450
 so this article is an article that 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:51.449
 probably already buying for a long time 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.579
 in italy then these colored pulleys 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.350
 but I always let go for the 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.899
 simple fact that I never found them 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.090
 for less than 15 20 euros the couple 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.399
 so I think the price is a little high 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.470
 for the object in question however 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.990
 clearly on the bone good site at two 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.970
 euro 85 moon I would say it is a job that 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.310
 it can be done 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.290
 clearly don't take it for maybe 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.890
 save weight because you consider that 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.630
 a pulley xdr with respect to this of 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.210
 bamboo of the difference is 2 grams 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.500
 then save 4 grams clearly 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.990
 not 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.850
 it doesn't make sense but I recommend it if 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:27.230
 you want to give a touch of style to the 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:30.650
 your mountain bike so if you want 

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:32.530
 do a little let's say a job of vi 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:34.910
 aesthetic appearance of your bike 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.470
 clearly consider these laws 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:38.840
 they are available in various colors 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:41.090
 here they are available in blue color 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.430
 red you see yellow but also black 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:45.770
 and gray and therefore definitely a choice 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:49.010
 of colors to associate them with the type of 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:51.820
 your bike then the frame and so on 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:53.930
 regarding these bearings 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:55.310
 inside they own these 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.420
 pulleys are of bearings a little 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.310
 details 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.899
 mica estense in the sense that it removed the 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:02.649
 side parts and something that has me 

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:04.910
 hit is the fact that the bearing 

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:07.039
 inside it can be removed easily 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:10.369
 and this is clearly a plus point 

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:12.410
 because if the pole is still in time 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:14.690
 already hard but your choice maybe yes 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.610
 ruin just go to the hardware store a 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.709
 buy a new air bearing e 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:21.020
 insert it inside clearly now 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:23.300
 I don't think I don't know how much it costs enzo a 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:25.400
 new bearing of this size 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:27.950
 I hope maybe the costs less than 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.350
 buy back the people was if you have 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:32.750
 hurry anyway you want to rearrange the 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:34.940
 your pulley is a bearing maybe 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:36.610
 has ruined definitely is very 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:39.110
 convenient to have the possibility of 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:41.390
 remove the old one was insert 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:43.280
 the new one in a few seconds and then 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:43.820
 reassemble everything is to resume at 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.220
 ride 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:48.019
 clearly the thing is at a point a 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:50.239
 please repeat because if you consider 

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:52.310
 this one here instead of an xtr the 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:54.370
 bearing cannot be removed 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:57.230
 easily so you simply need to 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:59.000
 we say remove it with more effort and 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:02.120
 this is therefore a plus point for 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.950
 regarding the pulleys on a bong 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.690
 woo and therefore with regards to the 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:07.340
 assembly is really very simple 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:09.500
 consider that various shows 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:11.720
 simply the screw that reads the 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:15.079
 old paul is already inserting the new one 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:17.120
 it is re-inhabit the whole in my opinion a 

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:18.920
 article that is worth maybe 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:22.310
 buy again if you want to give a 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:25.610
 touch of style to your bike if you have 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:27.920
 maybe a frame that has a red color 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:30.080
 or maybe any other kind of color 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:32.690
 but you want to associate some of the gods 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:34.760
 colored pulleys definitely is a 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:36.530
 article that is right for you 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:39.230
 just because anyway if you see a 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:41.750
 change becomes we have a little nicer 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:44.390
 to see also with the association 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:48.470
 just a different color than 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:50.690
 the black one of series for which nothing from 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:53.239
 tell you regarding assembly 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:55.489
 personally I did not find we say not 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:57.440
 there is a sense of rotation therefore reads or 

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:59.440
 on one side or the other 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:01.300
 so they are okay too not 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:03.910
 there is no problem regarding it 

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:06.790
 the glass top itself is 6 mm and then 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:09.430
 I don't think it's universal therefore different 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:11.260
 changes that I have mount let's call them monterano 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:13.900
 so I don't think so 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:16.630
 are the changes that have difficulty 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:18.160
 fit this type of pulleys 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:20.049
 clearly a little check those 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:23.050
 old consider that the other's here 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:25.660
 is 6 mm then check before 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:27.790
 buy for security that you can 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:30.700
 fit this kind of more law so 

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:32.950
 I guess all said if you remember that 

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:34.990
 you want to buy this item you find 

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:37.810
 the link in the description then use 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:41.160
 the one for the purchase for which I greet you 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:41.160
 and I refer you to the next videos
