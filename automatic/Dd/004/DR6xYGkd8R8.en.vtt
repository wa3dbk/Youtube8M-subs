00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.009
 Hello everyone, today I will show 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:07.770
 super simple technique that fits 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.599
 all as beginners so continue 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.980
 ritu width photographer for 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.620
 face contouring 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.990
 the technique came about by chance but when 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.510
 began to show it to the students it 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.960
 caused a violent reaction so I decided 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.369
 share with her on youtube too 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:25.949
 its main charm is 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:28.050
 that it is very simple and you just will 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:31.470
 very difficult to do with her 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.960
 stains or that you are not neat she 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.270
 will allow to draw your models cheekbones 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.600
 slightly rework face volumes 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.940
 raise the ages all you love to do 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.530
 gender is not only about ten times 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.120
 simpler 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:48.210
 photo with which we work today 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.789
 It has already been slightly processed by 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.430
 frequency decomposition techniques like this 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:56.699
 she looked like I softened my skin and 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.590
 few unwanted shadows snapshot 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.480
 I did not do a wonderful photographer 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.600
 Eugene link to it you can 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:06.330
 see in the description well and let's 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.610
 let's get down to applying the technique to us 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:12.600
 first you need to create an empty 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:15.060
 new layer and on this layer we will 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.740
 ordinary brush with the usual settings 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.990
 make sure just to brush 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.530
 bulat to a rather thin not very 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:24.450
 bold we will draw the markup 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:27.450
 lighten and darken begin 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.310
 blackout in our model a little bit 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.840
 big angular forehead want him 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:36.900
 slightly reduce 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:38.700
 and make it more rounded for this 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.070
 technique you don't need to draw much 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.869
 mark yourself where you would like 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:47.390
 to darken 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:47.390
 slightly darken the brow it is lighter than 2 and 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.890
 raise the outer corner of the eye 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:07.860
 everyone loves high model cheekbones 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:10.649
 Now let's take their stress 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.810
 white color and we will draw on 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:15.540
 places where we want to lighten up a little 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:21.450
 I always like to lighten our picture 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:23.820
 nose bridge lightening inner corner 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:26.490
 eyes will make your eyes visually a little more 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:29.610
 widely set now this 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:33.150
 considered fashionable can lighten 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:42.209
 under the eyes and at the outer edge of the nose this 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:44.610
 make the nose smarter and if under 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:49.640
 eyes have any darkening there 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:49.640
 also need to feel free to add color 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:58.200
 normal brighten near the outer bottom 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:03:01.470
 edges of the mouth there is dark skin to that 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:04.430
 such a move makes the jaw more clearly 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.430
 it's always beautiful 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:10.410
 still often lighten a tick above the top 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:12.840
 lip here we do not allow 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:15.830
 I only emphasize making photos 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.830
 thin black 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:29.340
 if your tea merges with your jaw it 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:31.200
 always doesn't look good then 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:33.810
 could you even darken 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:36.870
 here in this case we do not need it 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:39.079
 we have almost everything left only 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:42.109
 do a little trick 

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:43.230
 apply to our condition with markup 

00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:49.530
 usual 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:55.650
 blair on gauss until blur becomes 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:04:03.299
 very smooth after which we apply the mode 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:05.400
 softlight overlays if you have 

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:07.079
 it turned out too hard or too hard 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:12.409
 gently you can always reduce 

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:12.409
 transparency layer or duplicate it 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:22.060
 so here you can just do 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:24.610
 small up a ginger on your 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:28.750
 photos look he must 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:31.599
 naturally and delicately of course 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:35.050
 the professional you spend on must return 

00:04:31.599 --> 00:04:36.910
 hours and hours of time and this way is very 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:39.160
 easy available to everyone 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:41.860
 Thanks for watching this video I hope 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:44.410

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:47.500

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:52.569
 to grow and I am very motivated to 

00:04:49.509 --> 00:04:55.169
 creating new lessons successful weeks and 

00:04:52.569 --> 00:04:55.169
