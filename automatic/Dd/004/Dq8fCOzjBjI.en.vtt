00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:09.370 
let me test it you're a whole bunch of

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:11.670 
let me test it you're a whole bunch of
screenshots<00:05:09.930> let<00:05:10.930> you<00:05:11.080> know<00:05:11.200> how<00:05:11.350> it<00:05:11.470> works

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:11.680 
screenshots let you know how it works

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:14.430 
screenshots let you know how it works
and<00:05:11.980> I'll<00:05:12.760> run<00:05:12.970> some<00:05:13.150> files<00:05:13.450> through<00:05:13.690> it<00:05:13.810> and

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:14.440 
and I'll run some files through it and

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:16.440 
and I'll run some files through it and
we'll<00:05:14.980> see<00:05:15.130> how<00:05:15.280> I<00:05:15.310> performs<00:05:15.820> as<00:05:15.970> well<00:05:16.000> I'm

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:16.450 
we'll see how I performs as well I'm

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:19.080 
we'll see how I performs as well I'm
putting<00:05:16.630> up<00:05:16.780> against<00:05:17.110> one<00:05:17.200> of<00:05:17.230> my<00:05:17.380> other<00:05:18.090> nice

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:22.860 
boxes I have probably the focus or

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:26.820 
boxes I have probably the focus or
phonology<00:05:24.000> but<00:05:25.000> now<00:05:25.150> this<00:05:25.300> is<00:05:25.360> the<00:05:25.540> TS<00:05:25.840> four

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:26.830
