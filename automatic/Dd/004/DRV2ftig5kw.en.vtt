00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:32.680
 cristina hello to all the crisis the 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:35.079
 we have a guest because there is a lack 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:38.890
 race so that the end of the 

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:40.150
 speed citi and we have very good 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:42.280
 revisions of millions of 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:44.710
 good things at least we have a 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:47.140
 power is true in itself that we are 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:49.150
 that was looking for the fall is not going to 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:52.180
 delay anything and we will look for the podium 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:54.309
 but for that we have to do the 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:56.620
 deliver something very special I'm going to clicks 

00:00:54.309 --> 00:01:00.760
 so that it closes with a gold clasp and for 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:02.739
 that 2014 is the most special year with 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:05.050
 the most special helmet we are going to create the 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:07.090
 Corsica that you all chose with 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:08.740
 the designs that each one put and everything 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:10.950
 this in which christina most liked 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:13.979
 this is a corsa 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:16.350
 is one of the newest helmets but the 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.640
 newest helmet you have and a quantity 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.710
 of characteristics that are going to be 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.710
 very good matrix and I will tell you 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:29.250
 ok you have everything we have seen 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.289
 soon in one of the videos and it is that 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.270
 you will find motorcycling first 

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:35.429
 that you developed is special because 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.719
 you have 15% more field of view that 

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:38.340
 it means that when you bend 

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:40.560
 inside the motorcycle and you get into the 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.420
 dome on the straight you will be looking 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.909
 you will not have to lift the unit to 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.890
 that visual field is going to be here and what 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.979
 second that is very important not 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.659
 important you're going to see how awesome of 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.729
 the ventilation of this case and in Bogota 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.649
 work counts much more and it is the 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.360
 amount of air that comes in here 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:00.510
 reach the helmet to act 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:02.250
 this got into a lot of things 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:04.950
 what are we going to start doing but now 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:07.050
