00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.089
 this here is an eccentric low temperature 70 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.730
 degrees will not stop you on the arm 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:11.190
 next to the canister of gasoline what 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.799
 here gasoline is the lowest price word . now 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:17.220
 working on coal 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:20.550
 inside a circle of about 18 degrees 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:23.699
 20 but the windows are open a little bit 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.170
 ajar outdoor temperature 15 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:28.460
 degrees of frost 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.660
 here you will see the room is busy 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:33.750
 he is sad for everyone yet 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:36.190
 ignite help tires shade miles this 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:39.329
 trailer works with 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:42.820
 yourself master already in for finishing 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:45.670
 prey here the third day the third day on 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:47.620
 a load that is enough oven 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:51.789
 absolutely silent I don't feel 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:53.589
 no smell here no sound like 

00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:55.600
 it works no edge on the edge understandable 

00:00:53.589 --> 00:00:59.079
 the knee itself from food 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:01.500
 her knee on ice stretch goes about it 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:04.869
 it means about 5 meters 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.729
 us with many tribes and so not to change aha 

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:10.179
 which we will see later on exit 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:13.750
 there is a stove running that is everything 

00:01:10.179 --> 00:01:16.509
 absolutely clean i mean no they don't 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:19.569
 pouring nowhere no azov here 

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:20.670
 there is no smoke 

00:01:19.569 --> 00:01:23.860
 couple 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.670
 it is enough room for closer for 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:28.810
 came at once 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:30.220
 people sleep here therefore no 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:31.140
 carbon monoxide or some other 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:34.979
 down below 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:38.550
 times can not but now try 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:41.610
 watch it all outside out here 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:44.210
 here it does do knee through 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.860
 which is such an easy parok 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:50.850
 this all five meters that go 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:53.000
 out I myself went up means 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.000
 temperature 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:59.230
 although she is probably no close to the outside 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:03.640
 temperature I do not lead the surrounding 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:05.520
 surrounding environment here and sit 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:08.350
 In my opinion the informational moment 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.240
 The author claims that a white sheet of paper 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:12.820
 handkerchief anything if 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:14.560
 put on the output will be absolutely 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:17.730
 net myself all this video well now we 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.730
 demonstrate it 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.420
 residence 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:29.610
 cottage close- leaf or 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:45.880
 what smell should be weak weak 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:45.880
 smell 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:03:17.810
 slightly raise the wheels accumulated 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:20.270
 condensate hold combustion here 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:31.420
 practically no one got and so did 

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:34.989
 could not be the definition of the premises can 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:34.989
 use lead 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:46.830
 tricycles toning here please 

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:49.400
 a closer sheet is absolutely cleaning that i don't 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:49.400
 can fly 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:00.980
 let the weak still experience that 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:08.540
 bulk plus 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:21.540
 yes look . on it warmed 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:28.560
 what load did I have to sit down before 

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:32.130
 There have been types of uploaded ie about 20 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:36.310
 kilogram of 20 kilograms of coal to loaded 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:37.720
 can it on the third day and apparently 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:40.270
 on the occasion of frost running 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:43.780
 maximum mode seriously enough 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:46.390
 yes that is to say, before you get the rhythm 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:49.720
 will work further if there were 

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:53.470
 ambient temperature viz 

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:55.140
 let's say at level 0 when this here 

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:57.630
 lets say that it would 

00:04:55.140 --> 00:05:03.340
 load would be enough for a week 

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:07.540
 for she is this angle to grade 8 

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:10.840
 ask to show the special coal that 

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:11.830
 is it going to leave enough 

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:15.010
 of it is implicit 

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:18.550
 chunks of high quality coal 

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:21.240
 This is a common mixture that is sold. 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:24.640
 everywhere and everywhere 

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:26.160
 handle this case . We spoke 

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:29.430
 now 

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:31.890
 for plaids get an important moment stove 

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:32.970
 it works perfectly calmly 

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:35.130
 download 

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:38.400
 work and so it continues 

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:39.540
 work together nothing you there 

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:42.990
 will see opened 

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:45.420
 open depend on the anchor did not go not 

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:58.010
 there was no dust or any other 

00:05:45.420 --> 00:06:01.110
 accompanying this is some kind of trick 

00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:13.800
 some kind of trick somewhere day you are not like 

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:15.530
 we add up the factors 

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:18.600
 which gave cumulative 

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:22.310
 one invention invention new 

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:25.860
 boil I uploaded a little bit to activate 

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:40.760
 Today the designation is here 

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:47.940
 so he continues to work no 

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:50.390
 example of the movement and the stove is ready it's all 

00:06:47.940 --> 00:07:14.180
 burns and continues to burn do not tolerate 

00:06:50.390 --> 00:07:17.440
 open there some kind of coal is already burning 

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:17.440
 but very much 

00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:24.520
 should form it is burning theater 

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:24.520
 will treat
