this<00:02:24.780> means<00:02:24.990> if<00:02:25.260> I<00:02:25.320> don't<00:02:25.530> have<00:02:25.650> a<00:02:25.709> good

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
this means if I don't have a good

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.210 
this means if I don't have a good
feeling<00:02:26.100> then<00:02:26.370> I<00:02:26.459> won't<00:02:26.640> ride<00:02:26.850> it

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.589 

the<00:02:36.680> rider<00:02:36.950> can<00:02:37.280> gain<00:02:37.489> even<00:02:37.700> more<00:02:37.849> time<00:02:38.300> when

00:02:38.589 --> 00:02:38.599 
the rider can gain even more time when

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:40.930 
the rider can gain even more time when
exiting<00:02:38.959> bends<00:02:39.349> by<00:02:39.709> accelerating<00:02:40.430> early<00:02:40.790> and

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
exiting bends by accelerating early and

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:42.729 
exiting bends by accelerating early and
hard<00:02:41.209> providing<00:02:41.959> it<00:02:42.050> has<00:02:42.200> the<00:02:42.349> right<00:02:42.500> shock

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:42.739 
hard providing it has the right shock

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:47.199 
hard providing it has the right shock
absorber<00:02:45.069> yeah<00:02:46.069> we<00:02:46.250> have<00:02:46.400> a<00:02:46.430> spring<00:02:46.790> struck

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:47.209 
absorber yeah we have a spring struck

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:50.470 
absorber yeah we have a spring struck
this<00:02:47.720> is<00:02:47.900> a<00:02:47.930> DHX<00:02:48.709> bring<00:02:49.099> strut<00:02:49.459> as<00:02:49.940> I<00:02:50.090> see<00:02:50.300> now

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
this is a DHX bring strut as I see now

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.570 
this is a DHX bring strut as I see now
it<00:02:50.900> can<00:02:51.140> be<00:02:51.260> adjusted<00:02:51.349> quite<00:02:51.860> well<00:02:52.129> compared

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:52.580 
it can be adjusted quite well compared

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:54.729 
it can be adjusted quite well compared
to<00:02:52.700> the<00:02:52.790> previous<00:02:53.150> model<00:02:53.330> you<00:02:54.140> can<00:02:54.260> adjust<00:02:54.590> the

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:54.739 
to the previous model you can adjust the

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:56.229 
to the previous model you can adjust the
clicks<00:02:55.010> manually<00:02:55.580> without<00:02:55.849> using<00:02:56.180> a

00:02:56.229 --> 00:02:56.239 
clicks manually without using a

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:58.300 
clicks manually without using a
screwdriver<00:02:56.569> then<00:02:57.530> it's<00:02:57.709> even<00:02:57.950> easier<00:02:58.280> for

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 
screwdriver then it's even easier for

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:59.830 
screwdriver then it's even easier for
the<00:02:58.489> customer<00:02:58.640> to<00:02:58.910> adjust<00:02:59.300> the<00:02:59.420> motorbike

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
the customer to adjust the motorbike

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:05.940 
the customer to adjust the motorbike
really<00:03:00.140> quickly

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:08.370 

the<00:03:06.550> slight<00:03:06.790> slipping<00:03:07.270> means<00:03:07.599> that<00:03:07.840> Roland<00:03:08.230> is

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:08.380 
the slight slipping means that Roland is

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:10.170 
the slight slipping means that Roland is
accelerating<00:03:09.099> at<00:03:09.190> the<00:03:09.310> tires<00:03:09.520> limits<00:03:10.030> of

accelerating at the tires limits of

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.000 
accelerating at the tires limits of
adherence<00:03:10.690> he<00:03:11.080> explodes<00:03:11.500> the<00:03:11.680> engine

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
adherence he explodes the engine

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:14.130 
adherence he explodes the engine

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.140 
performance and grip completely this is

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:15.839 
performance and grip completely this is
only<00:03:14.290> possible<00:03:14.860> if<00:03:14.950> the<00:03:15.069> driver<00:03:15.310> has<00:03:15.580> clear
