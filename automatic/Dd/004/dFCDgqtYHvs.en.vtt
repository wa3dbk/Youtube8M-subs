00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:57.909 
particular match could be a little bit

00:01:57.909 --> 00:01:59.880 
particular match could be a little bit
like<00:01:58.119> the<00:01:58.630> other<00:01:58.750> matches<00:01:59.229> we've<00:01:59.470> seen<00:01:59.679> so<00:01:59.860> far

00:01:59.880 --> 00:01:59.890 
like the other matches we've seen so far

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:03.240 
like the other matches we've seen so far
into<00:02:00.580> these<00:02:00.759> so<00:02:01.479> what<00:02:02.259> we<00:02:02.349> might<00:02:02.560> city<00:02:03.130> is<00:02:03.220> a

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:03.250 
into these so what we might city is a

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:05.279 
into these so what we might city is a
couple<00:02:03.580> of<00:02:03.670> Falls<00:02:03.970> how<00:02:04.330> are<00:02:04.539> you<00:02:04.689> here<00:02:04.869> well<00:02:05.259> I

00:02:05.279 --> 00:02:05.289 
couple of Falls how are you here well I

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:06.510 
couple of Falls how are you here well I
think<00:02:05.530> you're<00:02:05.649> right<00:02:05.740> kid<00:02:05.950> I<00:02:05.979> think<00:02:06.099> the<00:02:06.340> fact

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:06.520 
think you're right kid I think the fact

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.130 
think you're right kid I think the fact
that<00:02:06.640> they're<00:02:06.849> moving<00:02:07.119> so<00:02:07.390> quickly<00:02:07.720> in<00:02:07.959> these

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.140 
that they're moving so quickly in these

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:09.839 
that they're moving so quickly in these
particular<00:02:08.319> races<00:02:08.950> because<00:02:09.099> these<00:02:09.549> weights

00:02:09.839 --> 00:02:09.849 
particular races because these weights

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:12.000 
particular races because these weights
are<00:02:10.000> lighter<00:02:10.060> you<00:02:10.569> may<00:02:10.840> see<00:02:10.899> them<00:02:11.380> Russian

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 
are lighter you may see them Russian

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:14.070 
are lighter you may see them Russian
just<00:02:12.280> a<00:02:12.370> little<00:02:12.640> bit<00:02:12.760> which<00:02:13.239> might<00:02:13.540> result<00:02:13.750> in

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
just a little bit which might result in

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.199 
just a little bit which might result in
a<00:02:14.200> fault<00:02:14.470> here<00:02:14.709> and<00:02:14.860> there<00:02:15.010> and<00:02:15.220> again<00:02:15.700> the

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:16.209 
a fault here and there and again the

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:18.030 
a fault here and there and again the
fault<00:02:16.540> is<00:02:16.780> something<00:02:17.200> that's<00:02:17.290> if<00:02:17.530> that<00:02:17.709> slows

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
fault is something that's if that slows

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.650 
fault is something that's if that slows
you<00:02:18.220> down<00:02:18.250> and<00:02:18.730> that<00:02:18.819> causes<00:02:19.060> you<00:02:19.330> to<00:02:19.450> fall

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
you down and that causes you to fall

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:21.449 
you down and that causes you to fall
behind<00:02:19.690> then<00:02:20.500> it's<00:02:20.680> over<00:02:20.859> for<00:02:21.160> you<00:02:21.250> so<00:02:21.400> you

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:21.459 
behind then it's over for you so you

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:23.370 
behind then it's over for you so you
need<00:02:21.670> to<00:02:21.760> be<00:02:21.880> very<00:02:22.120> pristine<00:02:22.690> and<00:02:22.870> very<00:02:23.049> clean

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
need to be very pristine and very clean

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.160 
need to be very pristine and very clean
in<00:02:23.530> these<00:02:23.650> races<00:02:23.890> you<00:02:24.609> can<00:02:24.760> see<00:02:24.940> here<00:02:25.239> that<00:02:25.269> DC

that point very important as you can see

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:18.679 
that point very important as you can see
the<00:03:17.159> distinction<00:03:17.669> between<00:03:17.790> first<00:03:18.239> and<00:03:18.359> second

the distinction between first and second
is<00:03:18.750> not<00:03:18.959> much<00:03:19.230> that<00:03:19.260> was<00:03:19.590> about<00:03:19.769> 10<00:03:20.040> seconds

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
is not much that was about 10 seconds
