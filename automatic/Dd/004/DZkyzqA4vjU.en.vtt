 tangerine to take advantage of what 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:42.720
 is the fruit of this action is for me 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.660
 attention pen and paper and write down the 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:52.510
 ingredients seems scrumptious mobbing 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:55.090
 mandarin we need 150 grams of 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:57.820
 perfect butter 150 grams of 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:01:01.719

 grams of sugar 2 eggs 2 180 grams 

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:06.160
 of flour 180 grams of flour 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:07.990
 teaspoon of half a teaspoon salt 

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:10.119
 salt a quarter of a teaspoon of cinnamon 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:12.430
 powder a quarter teaspoon of 

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:14.530
 cinnamon powder and a half tablespoon of 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:15.010
 scoop and half baking powder 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:19.300
 powder 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:21.100
 4 tangerines 4 mandarins perfect 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:24.030
 then we have all the 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:27.430
 ready ingredients 2 perfect 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:29.140
 taking advantage of that the tangerine is 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:31.540
 station and it 's economic part not 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:33.580
 we can take advantage of it in fact and 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:35.980
 prepare our children and their 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:38.560
 lotteries for the cole not to give them something 

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:41.230
 nutritious also and rich thanks and of 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:43.120
 get something out of you or something good and something 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:45.190
 meaty for that not always 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:48.040
 we use what gloves is for 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:50.050
 have more hygiene time to work the 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:52.300
 work you have to do is simply 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:54.570
 what everyone does not appeal an 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:54.570
 tangerine 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:58.780
 what I want them to buy if they can not 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:02.010
 buy mandarins when without faith 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:05.350
 so they start peeling their mandarin 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:07.360
 the most traditional way without the 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:09.070
 tangerine you use everything as it is 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.620
 as you can see they will 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:13.990
 enter the blender because this does not 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:15.670
 has pepa has to do without pepa in 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:17.190
 case you have paypal to take out the pepa 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.470
 moving marga 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.540
 that please we are we are warning 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.850
 how is the procedure like we saw 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.710
 how it is done by follow-up we follow 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:27.990
 with the following steps and the already 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:31.610
 we liquefy the magic in the cloth more than the 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:31.610
 we liquefy it and it will be like this 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:45.050
 but it 's a bit liquid and just 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:47.180
 they are going to have to the fourth and the 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:49.160
 speed or decide to implement as 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:51.470
 be muzzles we make texture there 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:54.590
 as a preliminary the no need either 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:59.030
 of straining the only one was cute so that's how 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:03:00.860
 how is it so perfect then 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:03.200
 then I'm going to have to put what 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:05.210
 what is butter at temperature 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.390
 environment if you want to say this that the 

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:11.200
 Butter 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:14.200
 It's easier at the time of baking 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.200
 weather 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.410
 so that to soften a little more 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:22.770
 and in this way I can use the 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:25.820
 mixer and be able to mix what is 

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:25.820
 the sugar 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:32.670
 carlitos with the recipe how many servings 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:38.940
 or more open points like the ones I've 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:42.470
 fact and sugar 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:44.960
 we already place 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:48.470
 with the help of the blender always 

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:50.930
 we started from lower to higher speed 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:54.190
 the circular or circular movement 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:54.190
 enveloping moments 

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:59.349
 and having to incorporate little by little 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:03.370
 so that it stays that way because they give you each 

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:06.040
 pasty that is the point that we are 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:10.959
 looking for that is going to loosen up with that the 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:13.900
 liquid of now the way can be 

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:16.180
 replaced by light orange orange 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:18.850
 any fruit then it will be reviewed by the 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:22.210
 fruits but depending on the quantity 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:25.150
 of juice you have has to be well quoted 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:26.860
 which can be replaced as 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:30.460
 we talked before we started too 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:32.169
 you can use this in clear to 10 in 6 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:33.689
 and moved for example from a present of 

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:36.089
 topical 

00:04:33.689 --> 00:04:38.419
 the defense of olate we add the 

00:04:36.089 --> 00:04:38.419
 egg 

00:04:41.839 --> 00:04:47.159
 missing eggs was 22 already one by one 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:49.049
 it is one by one 

00:04:47.159 --> 00:04:50.820
 exactly then we have added the 

00:04:49.049 --> 00:04:54.480
 Butter 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:56.400
 the sugar in the game is an egg one 

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:59.180
 for one we are talking now what is 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:59.180
 the flour 

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:03.610
 there's always one for because we're going to 

00:05:01.349 --> 00:05:06.300
 use what comes to be 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:06.300
 good 

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:16.240
 and we have added what comes to be 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:20.860
 they have to rather treat others 

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:23.759
 you're cinnamon in the cinnamon and you've asked 

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:23.759
 A little bit of 

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:32.980
 and it's already quite a secret like them 

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:35.320
 they're watching guys are staying 

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:38.790
 the recipe will add little to the 

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:38.790
 tangerine juice 

00:05:45.139 --> 00:05:50.830
 others emit colors on television 

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:50.830
 we were on TV 

00:05:51.759 --> 00:05:59.740
 we are increasing the speed 

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:59.740
 with it the consistency that remains 

00:06:05.249 --> 00:06:12.210
 and how time on television is tyrant 

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:13.620
 with the pathologist all that but as 

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:15.689
 they have television studying we carry 

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:19.139
 ending later 

00:06:15.689 --> 00:06:22.199
 debate this baked the step of 15 

00:06:19.139 --> 00:06:25.379
 minutes 185 degrees centigrade for that 

00:06:22.199 --> 00:06:28.160
 you need to place with a kilo 

00:06:25.379 --> 00:06:30.850
 kings that will be butter paper 

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:33.580
 this is not going to come out like this is going to come out 

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:37.659
 A) Yes 

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:39.520
 15 minutes from 15 to 20 minutes 

00:06:37.659 --> 00:06:41.199
 depending on how thick shifts 

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:42.669
 please let it be preheated then 

00:06:41.199 --> 00:06:47.469
 you can see what I have done is 

00:06:42.669 --> 00:06:49.210
 discarded real class of all the fence 

00:06:47.469 --> 00:06:50.980
 that does not come to be anything other than a 

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:52.960
 impalpable 

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:58.300
 it's an egg white on the verge of snow 

00:06:52.960 --> 00:07:02.050
 it rises a little different color 

00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:04.060
 chocolate either different colors 

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:06.000
 of conflict as you know we 

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:08.890
 can find in the street san esteban 

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:11.770
 284 san andrÃ©s between the eyes for 

00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:14.950
 Long can not call the 32 84 36 

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:16.810
 when 24 96 25 said they do not count in 

00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:19.980
 facebook or modernize or can not 

00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:22.990
 find also the front as the case 

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:24.130
 this is exquisite you have to do it 

00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:25.990
 in your house 

00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:31.060

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:35.590
 then you already know that was a mobile 

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:37.000
 of tangerine you can prepare it in 

00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:38.740
 Any inquiry is made later to 

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.510
 our friend carlitos we go one 

00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:43.800
 commercial break but we come with parade
