00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.060
 and 

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:10.370
 hello today we have a wedding with you 

00:00:07.729 --> 00:00:11.570
 I will show the design how to do it and further 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:15.080
 it will all depend on your imagination 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:17.740
 maybe you change the color you can do 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:20.420
 for example white and make pale pink 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:22.400
 roses can be changed color on 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:25.250
 light blue whether gentle lilac 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:27.920
 it all depends on your imagination let's 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:29.960
 let's start as my base gently 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:33.230
 pink lacquer firm 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:36.260
 oh sprinkles let's start with the ring finger 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:38.300
 so as you remember my heart so 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.199
 for this we need a cotton swab 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:43.219
 and acetone 

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:44.229
 I prefer to wash out the heart of acetone 

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:46.670
 than 

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:49.389
 draw shape and then paint over 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:49.389
 around varnish 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:59.160
 try to have a heart inside 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:01.140
 net on index fingers and 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.100
 pinky little roses are arranged in 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.100
 side jacket 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:11.829
 I use a round brush sable and in 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:11.829
 second size 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:14.159
 but 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:24.710
 we add leaves also making out 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.710
 semicircle 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.100
 on the ring finger we will have roses 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.540
 be in the form of such 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.540
 stylized french 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:45.030
 It will also be 3, and they will go on Tipsy 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:49.110
 sort of like a semicircle starting from the center and 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:51.450
 we draw letters from which go to each 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.720
 friend mentoring among themselves small 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.720
 space 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:06.920
 and now our manicure left to cover the 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:10.460
 remember to decorate for gonna be 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:12.920
 use these pearls right away 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:15.380
 make a reservation they keep very well I them 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.360
 for that I even hate it because then 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:19.160
 just do not tear off because I 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:22.190
 the eternal problem with the delivery of these 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:25.120
 pearls I glue them right on the minimum 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:25.120
 number of tops 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:34.250
 I have roses on my thumb 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:36.170

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.930

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:40.610
