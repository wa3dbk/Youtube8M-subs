00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
and that is getting incredibly close to

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.950

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
the final episode of this series I

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.960 
the final episode of this series I
reckon<00:01:10.439> this<00:01:10.979> might<00:01:11.250> actually<00:01:11.430> be<00:01:11.670> the

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
reckon this might actually be the

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.850 
reckon this might actually be the
penultimate<00:01:12.299> world<00:01:12.659> but<00:01:12.780> in<00:01:12.930> this<00:01:13.049> game<00:01:13.140> come

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
penultimate world but in this game come

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.620 
penultimate world but in this game come
get<00:01:14.040> us<00:01:14.220> go<00:01:14.369> try<00:01:14.640> and<00:01:14.670> cut<00:01:14.880> back<00:01:15.060> inside<00:01:15.390> the

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
get us go try and cut back inside the

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.350 
get us go try and cut back inside the
box<00:01:15.900> get<00:01:16.500> taken<00:01:16.890> down<00:01:16.920> and<00:01:17.310> the<00:01:17.670> ref<00:01:17.909> gives<00:01:18.180> us

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
box get taken down and the ref gives us

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.770 
box get taken down and the ref gives us
a<00:01:18.509> penalty<00:01:19.259> straight<00:01:20.159> away<00:01:20.790> and<00:01:21.119> we<00:01:21.270> are<00:01:21.420> going

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
a penalty straight away and we are going

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.020 
a penalty straight away and we are going
to<00:01:22.200> take<00:01:22.380> this<00:01:22.560> penalty<00:01:22.860> with<00:01:23.430> Erik<00:01:23.820> Lamela

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
to take this penalty with Erik Lamela

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.300 
to take this penalty with Erik Lamela
now<00:01:24.479> on<00:01:24.659> the<00:01:24.780> checklist<00:01:25.080> this<00:01:26.070> wasn't

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
now on the checklist this wasn't

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.160 
now on the checklist this wasn't
actually<00:01:26.850> an<00:01:26.939> objective<00:01:27.509> to<00:01:27.659> score<00:01:27.960> a<00:01:27.990> penalty

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
actually an objective to score a penalty

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.920 
actually an objective to score a penalty
it<00:01:28.799> probably<00:01:29.310> should<00:01:29.369> have<00:01:29.640> been<00:01:29.880> and<00:01:30.119> if<00:01:30.810> you

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
it probably should have been and if you

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.569 
it probably should have been and if you
think<00:01:30.960> I<00:01:31.290> should<00:01:31.500> get<00:01:31.590> some<00:01:31.770> bonus<00:01:31.920> money<00:01:32.100> for

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
think I should get some bonus money for

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.030 
think I should get some bonus money for
that<00:01:32.759> maybe<00:01:33.420> I<00:01:33.630> might<00:01:33.840> put<00:01:34.799> it<00:01:34.890> on<00:01:34.920> the

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
that maybe I might put it on the

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.950 
that maybe I might put it on the
checklist<00:01:35.310> but<00:01:35.579> I<00:01:35.670> think<00:01:35.880> we're<00:01:36.479> very<00:01:36.750> close

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
checklist but I think we're very close

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:37.969 
checklist but I think we're very close
to<00:01:37.140> the<00:01:37.200> end<00:01:37.320> now<00:01:37.380> so<00:01:37.560> it<00:01:37.650> doesn't<00:01:37.890> really

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
to the end now so it doesn't really

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.530 
to the end now so it doesn't really
matter<00:01:38.159> but<00:01:38.369> that<00:01:38.490> go<00:01:38.670> does<00:01:38.909> end<00:01:39.150> up<00:01:39.299> brave

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540

seventy three coins which is nowhere
near<00:01:46.530> enough<00:01:46.560> what<00:01:47.280> I<00:01:47.310> really<00:01:47.700> wanted<00:01:48.000> cuz<00:01:48.149> it

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
near enough what I really wanted cuz it

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.539
