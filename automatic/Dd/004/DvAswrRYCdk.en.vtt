00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.330 
the subtitle it's been transformed into
the<00:02:33.480> binding<00:02:33.840> and<00:02:33.990> now<00:02:34.680> you<00:02:34.740> just<00:02:35.010> keep<00:02:35.190> doing

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
the binding and now you just keep doing

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.070 
the binding and now you just keep doing
that<00:02:35.520> for<00:02:35.880> each<00:02:36.030> to<00:02:36.180> the<00:02:36.270> other<00:02:36.300> bindings<00:02:36.900> I

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
that for each to the other bindings I

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:38.990 
that for each to the other bindings I
actually<00:02:37.230> did<00:02:37.560> this<00:02:37.650> before<00:02:37.890> so<00:02:38.460> I<00:02:38.490> added<00:02:38.880> them

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
actually did this before so I added them

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.390 
actually did this before so I added them
in<00:02:39.060> each<00:02:39.570> one<00:02:39.750> individually<00:02:40.020> and<00:02:40.560> then<00:02:41.220> you

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
in each one individually and then you

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.760 
in each one individually and then you
can<00:02:41.580> see<00:02:41.820> that<00:02:42.120> you<00:02:42.240> have<00:02:42.270> a<00:02:42.840> box<00:02:43.080> template

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770 
can see that you have a box template

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:45.860 
can see that you have a box template
with<00:02:44.430> your<00:02:44.700> cover<00:02:44.940> and<00:02:45.209> then<00:02:45.360> each<00:02:45.600> of<00:02:45.630> the

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
with your cover and then each of the

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:49.070 
with your cover and then each of the
bindings<00:02:46.320> in<00:02:46.709> the<00:02:47.520> book<00:02:47.700> so<00:02:48.690> I<00:02:48.750> hope<00:02:48.930> this

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
bindings in the book so I hope this

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.550
