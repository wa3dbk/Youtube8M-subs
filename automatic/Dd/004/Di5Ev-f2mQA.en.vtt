nowadays<00:01:49.100> everything<00:01:49.550> gets<00:01:49.880> patched<00:01:50.120> so<00:01:50.600> if

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:50.690 
nowadays everything gets patched so if

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:52.240 
nowadays everything gets patched so if
there<00:01:50.870> are<00:01:50.990> some<00:01:51.200> glaring<00:01:51.500> problems<00:01:52.040> where

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:52.250 
there are some glaring problems where

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:56.600 
probably tweak them because I do think

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.480 
probably tweak them because I do think

fast<00:01:58.730> as<00:01:58.880> it<00:01:59.000> does<00:01:59.240> is<00:01:59.450> a<00:02:00.080> little<00:02:00.410> bit<00:02:00.560> too

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:00.740 
fast as it does is a little bit too

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.370 
fast as it does is a little bit too
extreme<00:02:00.920> in<00:02:01.550> you<00:02:02.330> know<00:02:02.450> comparison<00:02:03.080> to<00:02:03.200> just

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 
extreme in you know comparison to just

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.640 
extreme in you know comparison to just
juggling<00:02:03.680> and<00:02:04.040> comboing<00:02:04.460> and<00:02:04.730> things<00:02:05.650> it

juggling and comboing and things it

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:08.180 
juggling and comboing and things it
seems<00:02:06.800> really<00:02:07.160> strange<00:02:07.370> book

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
seems really strange book

seems really strange book
I've<00:02:08.670> not<00:02:08.940> played<00:02:09.060> the<00:02:09.240> full<00:02:09.390> game<00:02:09.600> who<00:02:09.900> knows

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
I've not played the full game who knows

I've not played the full game who knows
the<00:02:11.040> differences<00:02:11.520> between<00:02:11.550> this<00:02:12.090> and<00:02:12.300> the

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:12.570 
the differences between this and the

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:14.720 
the differences between this and the
version<00:02:12.990> i<00:02:13.170> played<00:02:13.470> of<00:02:13.710> this<00:02:13.860> exact<00:02:14.220> same<00:02:14.430> demo

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
version i played of this exact same demo

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.750 
version i played of this exact same demo
that<00:02:15.170> convention<00:02:16.170> was<00:02:16.530> so<00:02:16.710> different<00:02:16.980> it's

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
that convention was so different it's

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.300 
that convention was so different it's
it's<00:02:18.210> astounding<00:02:18.690> so<00:02:19.170> I<00:02:19.200> have<00:02:19.440> full<00:02:19.650> faith<00:02:19.710> the

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
it's astounding so I have full faith the

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.250 
it's astounding so I have full faith the
final<00:02:20.760> game<00:02:21.090> is<00:02:21.360> probably<00:02:21.600> going<00:02:22.020> to<00:02:22.110> be

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
final game is probably going to be

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.010 
final game is probably going to be
tweaked<00:02:22.950> as<00:02:23.190> well<00:02:23.630> there's<00:02:24.630> one<00:02:24.780> thing<00:02:24.900> I

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
tweaked as well there's one thing I

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.680 
tweaked as well there's one thing I
noticed<00:02:25.170> which<00:02:26.070> my<00:02:26.430> body<00:02:26.820> Lumia<00:02:27.150> can<00:02:27.300> back<00:02:27.450> up

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
noticed which my body Lumia can back up

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.660 
noticed which my body Lumia can back up
when<00:02:28.380> I<00:02:28.410> was<00:02:28.560> fighting<00:02:28.860> this<00:02:29.160> boss<00:02:29.370> at<00:02:29.550> that

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
when I was fighting this boss at that

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.670 
when I was fighting this boss at that
convention<00:02:30.240> every<00:02:30.870> time<00:02:31.020> she<00:02:31.080> swung<00:02:31.500> at<00:02:31.650> me

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
convention every time she swung at me

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.040 
convention every time she swung at me
when<00:02:31.920> I<00:02:31.950> pressed<00:02:32.280> evade<00:02:32.700> to<00:02:33.060> roll<00:02:33.330> and<00:02:33.780> my

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
when I pressed evade to roll and my

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.260 
when I pressed evade to roll and my
timings<00:02:34.440> pretty<00:02:34.620> good<00:02:34.950> she<00:02:35.640> hit<00:02:35.790> me<00:02:35.820> every

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 
timings pretty good she hit me every

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:38.420 
timings pretty good she hit me every
time<00:02:36.420> I<00:02:36.720> did<00:02:37.110> not<00:02:37.290> successfully<00:02:37.950> dodge<00:02:38.160> her

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
time I did not successfully dodge her

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.760 
time I did not successfully dodge her
attacks<00:02:38.460> with<00:02:39.030> a<00:02:39.060> roll<00:02:39.330> I<00:02:39.600> don't<00:02:40.500> know<00:02:40.590> if<00:02:40.650> they

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:40.770 
attacks with a roll I don't know if they

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:42.230 
attacks with a roll I don't know if they
tweaked<00:02:41.040> the<00:02:41.190> iframes<00:02:41.670> I<00:02:41.850> don't<00:02:42.030> know<00:02:42.090> if<00:02:42.150> the

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:42.240 
tweaked the iframes I don't know if the

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:43.730 
tweaked the iframes I don't know if the
tweaks<00:02:42.480> you<00:02:42.630> know<00:02:42.750> the<00:02:42.870> hit<00:02:43.050> radius<00:02:43.470> of<00:02:43.620> the

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:43.740 
tweaks you know the hit radius of the

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:46.790 
tweaks you know the hit radius of the
swing<00:02:44.010> but<00:02:44.610> this<00:02:45.090> boss<00:02:45.330> was<00:02:45.600> was<00:02:46.320> easier<00:02:46.740> to

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
swing but this boss was was easier to

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.430 
swing but this boss was was easier to
evade<00:02:47.250> by<00:02:47.490> double<00:02:47.850> jumping<00:02:48.240> than<00:02:48.720> it<00:02:48.840> was<00:02:49.080> by

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
evade by double jumping than it was by

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.500 
evade by double jumping than it was by
rolling<00:02:49.980> so<00:02:50.280> I<00:02:50.310> just<00:02:50.520> did<00:02:50.730> not<00:02:50.910> do<00:02:51.120> the<00:02:51.300> roll

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
rolling so I just did not do the roll

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:54.800 
rolling so I just did not do the roll
and<00:02:51.950> that<00:02:52.950> has<00:02:53.100> changed<00:02:53.400> massively<00:02:53.940> on<00:02:54.540> this

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
and that has changed massively on this

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:57.080 
and that has changed massively on this
version<00:02:55.320> because<00:02:56.010> it's<00:02:56.640> one<00:02:56.880> of<00:02:56.940> those<00:02:57.030> things

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
version because it's one of those things

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.660 
version because it's one of those things
where<00:02:57.380> whenever<00:02:58.380> your<00:02:58.620> role<00:02:58.830> seems<00:02:59.130> to<00:02:59.340> be<00:02:59.460> you

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
where whenever your role seems to be you

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.940 
where whenever your role seems to be you
know<00:02:59.790> enough<00:03:00.420> to<00:03:00.690> dodge<00:03:00.870> her<00:03:01.170> as<00:03:01.380> opposed<00:03:01.800> to

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
know enough to dodge her as opposed to

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.010 
know enough to dodge her as opposed to
having<00:03:02.130> to<00:03:02.400> time<00:03:02.610> in<00:03:02.880> which<00:03:03.090> is<00:03:03.330> a<00:03:03.540> little<00:03:03.810> bit

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:04.020 
having to time in which is a little bit

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:07.400 
having to time in which is a little bit
too<00:03:04.230> far<00:03:04.530> the<00:03:04.710> other<00:03:04.740> way<00:03:05.150> so<00:03:06.150> who<00:03:06.870> knows<00:03:06.900> guys

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
too far the other way so who knows guys

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:11.300 
too far the other way so who knows guys
but<00:03:08.010> that<00:03:08.850> is<00:03:09.030> the<00:03:09.270> the<00:03:09.600> boss<00:03:09.810> down<00:03:10.160> the<00:03:11.160> only

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
but that is the the boss down the only

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:12.770 
but that is the the boss down the only
thing<00:03:11.430> left<00:03:11.580> to<00:03:11.700> do<00:03:11.820> is<00:03:11.850> jump<00:03:12.120> across<00:03:12.360> and<00:03:12.690> then

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
thing left to do is jump across and then
