00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.580
 radio pl first youth media in 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:17.910
 France hi it's laure courtellemont 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:20.640
 this radio vl choreographer and I teach the 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:23.550
 dance is what I do it's I'm 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.800
 passionate passionate lover of the 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.330
 dancehall and I actually created my 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.189
 expression to me about the culture 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.890
 Jamaican dancehall called ragga 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:34.950
 jam for a very long time 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.020
 for over 15 years and so that's it 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.390
 I'm trying to choreograph dancehall 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.790
 respecting its origin its roots 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:45.510
 its history its meaning and its and its 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:47.610
 power and its depth but with the 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.620
 chance that europe is given to live 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:53.090
 and grow in the mix and in is 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.090
 in the opening to the other 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.130
 never happened to the dance actually and I 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:04.520
 I never said it would be my 

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:05.110
 profession when we breathe we do not go 

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:07.220
 account 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:09.740
 in-game tray that I do not realize 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:12.740
 I usually say that dance is 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:15.229
 my first language before French and 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:17.840
 I think we do not choose the dance 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:21.010
 it is she who chooses us and it is a 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:23.030
 it's a fox and it's mostly a 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:25.130
 conviction is something we have 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.960
 in his dance dance on his dna 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:28.160
 it's something that is part of 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.530
 of us it's a language it's a 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:32.149
 expression and I never decided to be 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.500
 in that sense I have always been 

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:36.350
 dancer and I have always danced since 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:43.490
 you're gorging 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:47.930
 parked xiaobo two camps game like I 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:51.490
 journey a lot gg the opportunity to see the 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:54.500
 how countries welcome and 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:56.570
 embrace dance and it's obvious that 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.640
 it's not in countries always the same 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:00.710
 thing 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:03.520
 it is clear that the place of art and 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:06.049
 especially dance in the united states is 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:09.320
 something other than europe 

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:11.630
 we are still in europe in dance 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:13.519
 as a hobby while it's a 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:15.980
 true art a real discipline is 

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:18.470
 a sport so a discipline enough 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.360
 crazy and it's true that I would say I 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:22.040
 would say that France for me has the 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.049
 best the largest pond is the 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.790
 best the best talents in the 

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:28.310
 dance but the problem is that the head 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.630
 she does not follow and so we never go to 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:32.670
 end of things unfortunately and 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:35.190
 here and so it's great it's sad 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.000
 because it's sad because because 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.830
 I think we have the best 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
 dancers of the world and that we could 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:40.470
 to go much further if we took 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:46.280
 the dance as a real profession a 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:49.560
 true art and conviction and that's it 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:51.120
 chicago coming out to score and 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.860
 catherine delhoume it was someone 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.480
 in my career the most beautiful meeting 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.310
 of my career the most beautiful meeting 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.360
 artistic it's impossible to answer 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.160
 to these questions because we have several 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.300
 there were plenty of them because in fact we 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.490
 is built by different things 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:04.200
 but there was a gentleman brian greene 

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:05.880
 who was one of the great encounters of 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:09.230
 my career of my dance which has me a lot 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:12.870
 built there was and song liu there was 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:18.010
 stéphanie el basri there was 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:20.739
 babson is in the lead there was the crazy af 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:23.020
 of jamaica who had there was a lot 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:24.550
 of people who made that I could 

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:33.040
 direct there was cameron one shot in 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:34.450
 my dream is to choreograph 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.040
 artists today that's for sure and 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:37.360
 to bring the dancehall where they 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:42.209
 deserve to go that is to say very very 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:42.209
 very very very far but an artist 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:46.360
 my dream 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:48.250
 I'm full I have so many dreams that 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:51.610
 that's just a part of one of 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:53.200
 my dreams but I would like to run to actually 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:54.880
 to the researchers I would like choreographed 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:56.890
 Beyoncé I would like to choreograph 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:04:00.130
 artists who really give madonna 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:02.140
 which really gives value to 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:03.400
 dancers and who have always respected 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:04.510
 their dancers and they always 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:08.519
 understood that the dancers was the 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:08.519
 strength of a visual 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:17.859
 when you pick up my phone and you 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:21.070
 look inside you'll find some 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:26.200
 dancehall is here and there and reynerie 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:28.300
 and house music too 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:30.940
 here you are going to find deep sounds 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:32.500
 is true and real music because 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:34.620
 I love, I'm in love with 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:34.620
 music
