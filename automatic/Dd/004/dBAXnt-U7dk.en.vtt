00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:11.269
 I will show you today how it 's done 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:15.030
 to polish the head 

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:16.859
 brownish to leave chrome can give a 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:20.220
 look here the underside of the engine already 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:22.199
 This chrome head was made has now been 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.570
 exchanged poetry now 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:27.510
 he still has some paint that 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:30.720
 I started doing the work on it. 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:34.290
 show the other side here where you 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:37.079
 can see that he is totally 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:42.329
 that thick layer with coating 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:45.750
 the bottom of the layer is the 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:48.120
 following procedures to 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.820
 anyone who wants to use paint remover to 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.370
 take away the thicker layer you can use 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:58.710
 also remembering to leave the engine of the 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:01:00.210
 hot bike is easier to move and 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.340
 who does not want to do the same is the 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:09.000
 cool driver now 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:11.040
 there you get a normal 400 and 600 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.830
 who do not have to sit is thinner 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.430
 the first 400 to remove the 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.810
 thick 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:21.360
 after you have passed the sandpaper that 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:25.170
 removed the part plus dropa reminding that 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:28.829
 always the soap any soap 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:32.520
 normal are the mother serves anyone 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:36.750
 You pick up the sandpaper, there's already a piece. 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:42.600
 here the pick up sandpaper goes in the soap 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:44.520
 take a peek and trash can leave until 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:48.869
 The time you see the most part left 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:51.030
 thick sandpaper can leave quite a bit 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:56.369
 here is a time-consuming procedure 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:58.259
 have to have patience screwed up 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:03.960
 aguinha and so it goes 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:08.220
 in the end when you passed the list with 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:10.540
 the ashes and saw that is already part 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:13.480
 easier 

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:16.640
 Where I went to get fine sandpaper can be the 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:18.320
 1,200 can be a friend that one to two 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.990
 thousand and five hundred if you find it 

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:23.300
 call 52 500 passes and is the more 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:27.350
 yes on the list more brightness of the remembering 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:33.590
 that without doing bad in the soap or passes 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:36.740
 right in the soap wet sandpaper passing 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:39.830
 where you want to chrome the 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:46.250
 cane on the rim 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:51.740
 on the table and can preach without 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:54.710
 The more 16 nails but chrome she goes 

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:59.660
 keep in mind that the older 

00:02:54.710 --> 00:03:02.360
 sandpaper gets better it gives more luster 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:04.880
 You always leave that part here. 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:06.190
 now my black one who does gives 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:14.530
 brightness 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:14.530
 Here you go, you get the ball back a lot. 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:31.540
 Can you see that you stayed there, or not? 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:34.420
 promoter increase 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:37.930
 There you make it like the engine passed. 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:39.549
 there was an engine for not having 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:42.670
 that staying with you calls every time you get a 

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:45.760
 normal pump passes in the soap is for 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:48.129
 keep it clean every time you dirty 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:55.329
 that the driver fled wants to wash love 

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:57.819
 You get a pump from a soap scrub. 

00:03:55.329 --> 00:04:00.250
 that even here on my bottom 

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:02.730
 cent makes a talent calmed down 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:02.730
 best 

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:14.430
 Look, you can see that he's already a 

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:14.430
 a little more proven 

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:24.789
 The more trash you can stop 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:25.720
 new one on top of where it is also 

00:04:24.789 --> 00:04:28.930
 when he stays 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:36.750
 When he has lost a little the brightness has 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:41.380
 nothing to see garbage or make a bombril zin 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:44.500
 wet the jael 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:45.970
 This is the procedure that takes time but 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:48.550
 It's worth it for anyone who wants to have a 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:52.349
 more caprice leave the hubby motor 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:54.700
 leave a stick to the air king 

00:04:52.349 --> 00:04:56.860
 I hope I have help everyone 

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:58.930
 then whoever has doubts bets below the 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:59.919
 video the question that if I know how to fight 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:01.990
 responding 

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:03.460
 I made the video more to help everyone 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:06.250
 here was a group that was with 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:08.500
 doubt about how to do and that engine 

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:10.510
 chrome would send to the evil had as 

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:12.760
 Chroma at home has like staying at home 

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:15.039
 so those more chrome engines give 

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:17.680
 It's just the guy sending me but what I 

00:05:15.039 --> 00:05:22.650
 I could learn, I'll move on. 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:22.650
 and part of the galley thank you all
