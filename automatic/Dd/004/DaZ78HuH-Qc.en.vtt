I<00:00:28.500> think<00:00:28.920> that's<00:00:29.869> know<00:00:30.869> that<00:00:31.679> you<00:00:32.279> can<00:00:32.430> monitor

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
I think that's know that you can monitor

I think that's know that you can monitor
cable<00:00:33.180> open<00:00:33.450> I<00:00:33.690> think<00:00:33.960> they<00:00:34.079> both<00:00:34.260> have<00:00:34.320> screws

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
cable open I think they both have screws

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:44.690 
cable open I think they both have screws
right<00:00:41.750> the<00:00:42.750> matrix<00:00:43.290> used<00:00:43.710> to<00:00:43.860> run<00:00:44.070> pretty<00:00:44.399> well

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
right the matrix used to run pretty well

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.869 
right the matrix used to run pretty well
but<00:00:45.329> it<00:00:45.480> slowed<00:00:45.719> down<00:00:45.750> all<00:00:46.379> the<00:00:46.500> time<00:00:46.879> cipher

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
but it slowed down all the time cipher

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:54.819 
but it slowed down all the time cipher
they<00:00:48.450> torrents<00:00:48.989> a<00:00:49.079> lot<00:00:49.350> of<00:00:49.500> movies
