 width has been pulled and wide after 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.650
 slipped up 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:27.810
 it comes again to a cpu material 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:31.320
 use what the shoes in the front 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.969

 material that the shoes in this 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:51.690
 much better fixated about it 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.579
 also comes in the front area like the 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:57.059
 ipod touch for use that means stop 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:59.070

 the half touch maker the slightly softer 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:21.390
 is and has something more dampening in it 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.460
 lateral area on both sides 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.930
 comes again the well-known often action 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.020
 mesh material for use 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:30.600

 for a high level of comfort, too 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.310
 that the shoes are not abrasion resistant or 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.680
 are resistant to abrasion and just against third 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.110
 better protected in this area 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.299
 everything in the back and side 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.880
 area here come down the run 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:46.680
 protection pack for use the 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:50.009
 protection packs are here again 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:53.189
 Extra steaming stories the area 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:55.380
 Eclipse thought comes in the lower range 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:57.990
 the energy pulse or to use the 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.659
 energy pulse zone ensures the spring 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:03.390
 effect that is to press on the occurrence 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:05.549
 the shoes have something against it and so on 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.680
 you consume less energy and that 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:08.970
 occurs at each 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:12.490
 this is one of the key features of the 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:14.050
 adidas micoach 1.02 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:18.490
 and of course it's here too 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:21.100
 again the sole is complete with micros 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:23.410
 equipped that means low weight 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:25.420
 through in sprint frame plus micoach it 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:27.460
 ie the chip to use and can 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:29.800
 especially when it comes to energy footwear 

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:33.490
 your distances from your walks and everything 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:35.500
 record are a cam trialog 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:36.520
 and design as we already have from many 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.860
 know other schools 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:40.870
 it is a slightly longer note system 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:43.930
 which makes you feel good in that 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:46.210
 Curfew while it comes in but that too 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:48.100
 on soft, almost soft pitches 

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:50.110
 still offers a very good stand 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:53.350
 And so the shoes are mostly on 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:55.210
 Among other things it means the shoes 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:58.060
 if everything stays that way manuel new 

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:59.080
 wear so far on the yes 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.690
