Drakkar<00:00:02.610> somnom<00:00:03.149> it<00:00:03.899> is<00:00:04.259> a<00:00:04.290> full<00:00:05.160> carbon<00:00:05.520> fiber

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:05.910 
Drakkar somnom it is a full carbon fiber

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:07.970 
Drakkar somnom it is a full carbon fiber
frame<00:00:06.299> for<00:00:06.509> this<00:00:06.600> year<00:00:06.930> it's<00:00:07.379> quite<00:00:07.620> cool<00:00:07.859> as

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
frame for this year it's quite cool as

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:09.770 
frame for this year it's quite cool as
one<00:00:08.130> of<00:00:08.160> the<00:00:08.280> only<00:00:08.460> frames<00:00:09.179> in<00:00:09.360> the<00:00:09.450> pits<00:00:09.690> that

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
one of the only frames in the pits that

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.900 
one of the only frames in the pits that
actually<00:00:10.200> has<00:00:10.349> a<00:00:10.380> full<00:00:10.710> carbon<00:00:11.130> frame<00:00:11.400> so

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
actually has a full carbon frame so

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.140 
actually has a full carbon frame so
obviously<00:00:12.389> again<00:00:13.190> not<00:00:14.190> only<00:00:14.429> a<00:00:14.460> weight<00:00:14.730> that

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
obviously again not only a weight that

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:16.880 
obviously again not only a weight that
they're<00:00:15.299> trying<00:00:15.509> to<00:00:15.540> get<00:00:15.719> down<00:00:16.080> but<00:00:16.710> also

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
they're trying to get down but also

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.710 
they're trying to get down but also
eliminate<00:00:17.490> some<00:00:17.760> of<00:00:17.789> the<00:00:17.910> vibration<00:00:18.510> from<00:00:18.660> the

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
eliminate some of the vibration from the

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.720 
eliminate some of the vibration from the
rough<00:00:18.960> tracks<00:00:19.260> that<00:00:19.500> these<00:00:20.130> things<00:00:20.369> are<00:00:20.550> put

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730

from<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.650> fork<00:01:04.920> and<00:01:05.630> also<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:07.049> rear<00:01:07.260> shock

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
from the fork and also the rear shock

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.920 
from the fork and also the rear shock
he's<00:01:07.830> got<00:01:08.010> the<00:01:08.100> Moto<00:01:08.400> c2<00:01:09.060> our<00:01:09.210> shock

he's got the Moto c2 our shock
it<00:01:10.170> looks<00:01:10.320> really<00:01:10.619> trick<00:01:11.040> rental<00:01:11.670> grips<00:01:11.970> but

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
it looks really trick rental grips but

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.600 
it looks really trick rental grips but
they're<00:01:12.689> actually<00:01:12.810> wired<00:01:13.290> on<00:01:13.650> so<00:01:14.040> like<00:01:14.490> you

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
they're actually wired on so like you

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.609 
they're actually wired on so like you
