 I think it makes you work hard. 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:24.119
 You like a lot of bugs examples 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:28.380
 I still have five programs . 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:30.740
 My parents are going to have a game, but three of five 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.740
 I will not 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:39.600
 Because you have to organize your own production program , 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:43.890
 Nowadays , after being pumped, there are only two of them together. 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:50.059
 I came here for a while, but you do receive a direct example is the fact that today I am learning 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:50.059

00:00:54.440 --> 00:01:05.800
 If you know that geolro go to Paris, for example, seats Hey I think the knee 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:05.800
 This is the kind of thing that can be done in terms of broadcasting. 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:17.290
 Surely it's hard to see. 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:22.510
 That's not the case . 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:28.300
 Once you 've eaten it, you 've been brilliant and have done well with your firepower. 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:32.560
 You just have to prepare him for a fallout. 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:34.090
 I started out as an entertainment program without a law to think of myself 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.610
 I 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:42.100
 There is a possibility that it will fall behind because it can not adapt . 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:46.690
 Once the drama unravel a little body, because other chapters ought now to the next stage name 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:51.820
 And inde some good doeteumyeon into this thing again of that time, another partner community 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:52.900
 What a very tall studded pushed by the high ratings that soap operas For so just one day 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:58.180
 Once terminated 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:58.660
 Well I carried out for errors on their part and now, unfortunately, some I 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:03.070
 I think 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:07.210
 Yeah, but my first color TV was early mc. 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:12.220
 And then , 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:16.690
 I just got a commemorative note from mbc 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:20.230
 When MiYoung did or when the book was told, when I was discharged 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:23.830

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:40.810
 1 1 2 Dual is a little damaging to talk 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:47.110
 For mbc had done so, I do not know the sajangsil adopted 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:49.690
 I met such a situation the parents were all ready now, Mistress bad eh eh 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:55.690
 But now the reason I fold my mind 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:58.960
 In fact, when I go to the army, 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:03.460
 I do not take over the program that goes up. 

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:04.090
 Do a good break even if only for the vain yokmeokneun though, even though such a situation 0 

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:07.540
 2 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:11.620
 Because indeed I take it graciously gave it everything and then keep a rather good 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:13.120
 It is better to develop and because of the problem, 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:16.180

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:42.340
