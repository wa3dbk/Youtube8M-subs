 Good day dear subscribers and viewers 

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:05.009
 channel my name is Andrei and let's 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:05.790
 look at the toy called block 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.490
 story 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.740
 in general this is a crafting 3d game 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.469
 like minecraft to article 1 honors 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.540
 once on the fact that here although the principle 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.850
 my contract if the same level up grows 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.189
 level here too we are in a card reader that 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.650
 do we extract ore from us pumped 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.750
 level and you see the top pit extremely 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.240
 us hearts of our lives then she 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.609
 who use fall songs started 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.550
 here is a pancake mono which gives us 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:34.610
 the ability to fly let's say f 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.530
 and can fly into the air and fly 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:41.180
 when we give it to me as an apparatus 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:46.230
 simple and dying yes yes by the way yes that's it 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:49.020
 appear somewhere here too grand for a long time 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:52.199
 were tested in different places okay in 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.699
 Generally and experience there and three icons 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.699
 there are such greens on the sly 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.899
 when we mine ore say masters 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:02.820
 we pump over 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:05.159
 and we can open another such 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:08.280
 talent icon that is and systematically 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:10.409
 arrow damage shot bag breath 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.780
 the speed of the company baba blood and everything is possible 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.549
 pump even weapons have ampoule 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.750
 different well such between gunshot 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:20.270
 weapons amano let's say speed 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:23.360
 cool tatis going to increase to 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:26.240
 Example 4g strainer did not appear here we are 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:29.030
 We start with the fact that we put the craft bench 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:31.190
 workbench open it only valid 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.140
 what I passed the caste on here here with a workbench 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:36.229
 be carried on like minecraft with activity 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:39.190
 from the position in our very workbench 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:42.229
 items of us in the map, and another thing 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:44.390
 we produce different material 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:46.640
 mission brought material and here from us 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:48.759
 China pain on it seems clean 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.680
 coal and let's say it's a whale's pipe 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:53.240
 now let's say I recently need a way here 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:57.290
 another quest to do everything for a little bit 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:59.090
 I'll tell you later until I allow 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:03.380
 hunter's dagger I can craft because 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:05.450
 what's available to me now and became the recipe 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.340
 recipe articles some closed twitch 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:08.890
 nobody open nobody else locked and 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.390
 need to understand the quest 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:13.310
 different easy to understand and to open 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.560
 get up and talking recipe lights is divided 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:18.200
 also very moon on different under the menu 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:21.590
 items let's say a bucket there is a fence 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:24.290
 ladder blah blah blah tools out 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:25.160
 close different thirty hoes just yet 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:28.760
 blah blah blah 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:30.980
 weapon arrows there bows transport boat 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.900
 engine i.e. this is cool kotian armor 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.910
 to teach the dragon monster in short 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:39.049
 network of jokes seedlings that us 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:41.030
 even animals can eat 

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:42.799
 can paint imagine i don't know not 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:46.010
 I know if mappers are an opportunity but 

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:48.709
 it's cool tyrannosaurus rex crafted 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:50.959
 super but first let's get the weapon 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:53.690
 hunter's dagger we need a stick and for 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:56.299
 coal is not two iron 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:59.090
 let's perhaps first affliction 

00:02:56.299 --> 00:03:02.930
 to go and so need from 1 t co2 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:06.140
 do on 4 shelves now two iron and 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:08.480
 one stick and great 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:09.860
 we have a dagger by the way when here 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:12.319
 dozens of letters it does not mean that 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:14.840
 subjects here are such a dagger and so 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:16.819
 did by no means we did the opportunity 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:19.459
 quickly court to go with a dagger to 

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:21.440
 increase the opportunity need to say more 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:24.709
 times the same thing twenty times 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:27.770
 you can give time to click on it 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:30.890
 our dagger appears but so easy we 

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:32.709
 we were him we can not fight that is 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:35.180
 we don't even have to go kill someone 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:38.150
 let's say to this guy but not very much 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:42.080
 although he is not just a man and explain for 1 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:44.440
 7 to 10 take off yes did not kill it 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:47.780
 impossible just at this stage 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:51.650
 Here in these here the Vikings this principle 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:53.810
 value our let's say so in guys who 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:56.600
 help to do something honest 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:59.060
 of him will not attack then hell 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:59.540
 In short, you did not give the quest there I completed 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:01.610
 quest 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:03.920
 received but also drawings and a new task 

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:06.830
 again this was pumping it up to 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:10.549
 infinity do you understand on the bayonet again 

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:12.459
 same if we somewhere was here a different bunch 

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:16.070
 the caves of the flying islands are very beautiful 

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:18.169
 ores will decrease different types of ore today 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:20.570
 with different colors that's what's interesting 

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:22.190
 there is a little red there 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:25.490
 to heal you know that pink to me 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:27.979
 titus emeralds this is also cool cool 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:30.440

 NRA he certainly has all sorts of 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:44.050
 the creatures live with the bad ones that and 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:46.610
 strive to chew on time I don't want 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:49.880
 who strive to bite you 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:51.470

 In short, take a word is not easy 

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:10.400

 we go down the farther we go down 

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:44.900
 the more terrible stories that awaits us 

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:48.410

 such a play she liked playing 

00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:25.719
 In principle, it makes sense not to play like 

00:07:23.349 --> 00:07:30.279
 block micro with sides of pixel 

00:07:25.719 --> 00:07:31.749
