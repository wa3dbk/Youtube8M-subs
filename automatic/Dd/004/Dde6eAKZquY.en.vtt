00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:32.440 
issue right now he's a man without a

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:34.260 
issue right now he's a man without a
position<00:04:32.980> he<00:04:33.310> has<00:04:33.430> a<00:04:33.460> lot<00:04:33.670> of<00:04:33.700> point<00:04:33.940> guard

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:34.270 
position he has a lot of point guard

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:36.150 
position he has a lot of point guard
tendencies<00:04:34.930> but<00:04:34.960> he<00:04:35.260> can't<00:04:35.500> really<00:04:35.740> guard<00:04:35.980> the

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:36.160 
tendencies but he can't really guard the

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.130 
tendencies but he can't really guard the
point<00:04:36.430> he's<00:04:36.790> the<00:04:36.970> size<00:04:37.240> of<00:04:37.510> a<00:04:37.570> shooting<00:04:37.990> guard
