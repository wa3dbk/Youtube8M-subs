you can't kick up anti-aliasing you can

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.190 
you can't kick up anti-aliasing you can
play<00:02:25.790> it<00:02:25.850> at<00:02:26.000> slightly<00:02:26.570> higher<00:02:26.720> resolution

you're going to be played on a 30
because<00:02:28.430> the<00:02:28.640> computer<00:02:28.970> would<00:02:29.090> incinerate

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
because the computer would incinerate
