00:00:10.079 --> 00:00:14.409
 hi everyone guys today is a nice thing 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:16.660
 day for all the fans of the saga of 

00:00:14.409 --> 00:00:18.360
 pokémon was finally released the 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:20.410
 pokémon ancient times demo 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:22.630
 rightly many of you right now 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:25.360
 they will have wondered but few what the hell 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:27.100
 is pokemon ancient times it is a 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:29.680
 completely Italian indie game that 

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:31.330
 assumes the task of explaining that 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:34.059
 what happened when emu 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:35.649
 began to run low on the planet 

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:37.420
 in a few words the origin of all the 

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:39.339
 pokémon that preceded all 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:41.260
 current generations 

00:00:39.339 --> 00:00:43.539
 the project was born about a year ago with 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:45.670
 the ambitious task of creating from scratch a 

00:00:43.539 --> 00:00:47.469
 new universe and many new creatures 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:49.359
 that would populate it 

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:51.489
 but after some problems after the 

00:00:49.359 --> 00:00:53.710
 training the development team the bars 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:55.569
 askoll have finally succeeded in 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:57.699
 release a little taste of that 

00:00:55.569 --> 00:00:59.229
 which will be the full version 

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:00.370
 I would like to congratulate you immediately and 

00:00:59.229 --> 00:01:02.199
 designers as you will have 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:03.819
 definitely noticed from the trailer on 

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:05.710
 level of detail in entering and 

00:01:03.819 --> 00:01:07.420
 animate every little aspect of these 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:09.880
 new creatures is really very high 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:12.160
 fully reflects the original style 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.020
 of the game freaks I must say that also the 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:15.850
 coesa ctim music, however, are worthy 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.280
 of note even if the old man's voice 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:19.540
 it made me smile a little 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.220
 the intro is absolutely fantastic 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:23.350
 succeeds perfectly in the task of 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:25.480
 entice a new player into the 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:27.370
 enter this universe 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:29.170
 the game menu is rightly simple 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:31.150
 however an option menu is missing but 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:33.670
 I don't think that in this case it is much 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:34.600
 necessary since it is precisely one 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:36.070
 demo 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.110
 let's start immediately with the arcade mode 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:40.510
 as well as the only one that confronts us 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:42.370
 the ability to choose like everyone 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:44.680
 previous games the sex of ours 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:46.450
 character again me 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:48.670
 like designs that are very reminiscent 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.170
 the original style of the characters that 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:50.950
 characterized the old series of 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:52.930
 pokemon 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:54.610
 after choosing sex we would have immediately 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:56.170
 the selection screen of ours 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:58.270
 adventure companion 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.880
 once again as in all others 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:03.430
 games will be put before the choice 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.040
 of three different pokémon by chance one 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:07.360
 water a grass is a fire 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.250
 the choice we will make will go 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.140
 obviously affect the decision of the 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:13.060
 our rival who is willing to do anything 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:13.720
 to make us lose obviously choose 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.780
 the guy 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:18.130
 more effective against ours for me is 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.410
 It was love at first sight 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:22.090
 with the new type of soap water the 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:24.280
 which is a little bit reminds you of the name of 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:27.160
 a soap for the hands but seriously 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.600
 it is so well made centering in 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.340
 full style of the Japanese house that 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:32.350
 I would love a pillow with its shape 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.570
 in 1 1 scale you can keep beautiful 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:35.200
 view on my bed after doing the 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:37.360
 first choice 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:40.000
 we suddenly find ourselves without many 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:41.380
 explanations before the possibility of 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.510
 having to choose other pokémon 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:45.790
 making a quick reasoning the choice 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:48.040
 of the other two it becomes almost immediate 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:50.530
 having chosen a water pokémon mine 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.510
 rival will have taken the grass one and then 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:54.220
 to be able to defeat him without too many 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:56.770
 problems choosing an effective type 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:59.740
 against that kind of pokemon it won't be for 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:01.630
 so difficult to humiliate this rival 

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:03.850
 and here we are in front of the 38 new ones 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:05.170
 creatures and how much is taken care of 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:07.480
 details and with different others 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:09.850
 The characteristics that make them unique 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:12.340
 from each other but quoting ours 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:15.400
 linen banishment to the talk we enter immediately 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:18.340
 in the heart of the action throwing ourselves into it 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:21.010
 our first battle against office la 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:24.010
 our rival will start already at the level 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:25.870
 30 with some moves unlock the system 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:26.890
 combat is identical to each 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.019
 other version of this game 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:31.090
 absolutely nothing to say 

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:33.310
 fully functional and as great 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:35.110
 surprise also the various effects caused by 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:37.090
 some moves like hypnosis or paralyzing 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:39.489
 are already working in the same demo 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:41.320
 but also still the possibility of 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:42.910
 being able to use the objects but they are 

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:45.730
 sure they will be implemented in 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:48.790
 following is always difficult to succeed 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:50.830
 realize one and that manages to put in 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:52.180
 difficulty a player in this game 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:54.840
 I must say that artificial intelligence 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:57.850
 behaves very well some of it 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:04:00.040
 small defect often present also to 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:02.110
 several previous games of the series of 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:04.299
 pokémon as present two try to re 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:05.290
 put a creature to sleep already underneath 

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:07.360
 the effect of hypnosis 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:09.610
 unfortunately the demo does not allow us to 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:11.080
 try a lot even if short I have to say 

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:12.880
 which impressed me positively 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:14.410
 I'm glad to see you continue 

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:15.670
 Italian development is trying to give 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:17.470
 life to a new game of this 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:18.489
 famous saga and I'm looking forward to 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:20.560
 see finished product 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:22.810
 what a little bit made me turn away 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:24.610
 the nose is that he got the impression that 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:26.310
 the development of this demo is me 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:28.590
 it seemed a bit hasty 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:31.050
 I know perfectly the difficulties of 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:33.240
 create games especially if work 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:34.580
 to play must include many 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:37.590
 aspects like artificial intelligence 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:39.510
 arthur dialogues is an entire system of 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:40.950
 game to build what i am 

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:42.600
 trying to say is that in whose eyes 

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:44.580
 does not know what all of them are 

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:46.080
 difficulties of such work this 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:49.470
 demo may be a little bit 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:50.910
 strips my last concern but 

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:52.260
 also reason for great esteem in the 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:54.930
 against those who have made this choice 

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:56.400
 difficult certainly moved by 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:58.860
 great passion for this universe 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:01.530
 derives from having chosen to create a 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:03.570
 so famous game without the rights to 

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:05.070
 be able to use the pokémon brand that 

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:05.729
 like everybody we know a brand 

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:07.950
 registered 

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:09.510
 I hope they are not forced to 

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:10.950
 having to stop development for 

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:12.810
 legal reasons why personally 

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:14.490
 speaking I am very attracted by 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:16.620
 product they are creating and me 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:18.510
 would be very sorry if such a project 

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:20.360
 ambitious to which I look forward to 

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:23.040
 play never see the light 

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:25.380
 for this little review or better 

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:27.630
 preview is everything and see you at a 

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:31.190
 next video I don't know how to say goodbye 

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:31.190
 the other then hello to all the Hon
