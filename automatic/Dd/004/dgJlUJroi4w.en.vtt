 infection by all the rules 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:09.580
 world medicine start with the question and what 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:13.140
 is a fungal infection fungal 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:15.370
 infection this infection is caused by i 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:19.750
 representatives of the kingdom of mushrooms 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:26.260
 eat these ken mushrooms on what they grow 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:32.010
 here they commit growing disease 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:34.780
 expressed in redness bude pain 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.670
 disgusting odors and appearance 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:38.709
 also 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:41.340
 disgusting is all fungal symptom 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:41.340
 infections 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:50.730
 such as these here 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:55.960
 disfigured nails world standard 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:58.080
 eagle congress the cause of the disease fungus 

00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:02.130
 it means you need to kill 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:05.790
 antifungal drugs used 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:10.530
 internal reception ie tablets 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:14.530
 treatment is a fairly long way 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:15.400
 infection in the legs is treated by the reception 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:19.750
 pills 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:22.000
 inside it is a world standard kill 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:22.480
 the fungus that makes the tablet taken 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.450
 inside 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:29.290
 it accumulates in game scales 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:33.250
 mushrooms and the idea as they eat she 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:35.560
 than live and die natural 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:44.940
 poisoned by antifungal death 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:48.730
 drugs and everything begs the question what 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:53.910
 do with this nail and do I need something with 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:59.500
 do it and whether to remove the nail 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:04:03.760
 fundamentally there are two different approaches we 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:05.860
 not against local treatment not against not 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:09.610
 against absolutely we are due to local 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:12.280
 use of ointment and for that you could 

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:15.580
 this bad ugly nail take off and 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:18.390
 give the opportunity to grow new for this 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:21.670
 there is a certain group 

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:23.500
 drugs what is this medicine and how 

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:25.480
 this group calls have a group 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:28.750
 drugs called kirata 

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:31.030
 lithic only taras cipher this is from 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:34.050
 the words keratin is the substance from 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:36.460
 which is formed by a nail flies 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:39.370
 dissolving, that is, some certain 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:42.000
 substances that help you soften 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:43.960
 affected nail so that the first 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.570
 facilitate the action of medicinal 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:48.200
 drugs on the other hand are faster 

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:50.990
 accelerate new growth 

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:54.350
 How do these drugs work? 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:57.560
 In its composition are two substances of faith and there 

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:59.510
 obviously urea acts on the elbow 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:01.640
 so here you are watching i will show 

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:05.350
 specially we took a sponge which if 

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:05.350
 immerse the water it will fill with water 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:11.270
 either you all know well if you had long 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:13.490
 keep your hands in the water your nails will 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:15.800
 softer and thicker 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:18.800
 urea acts exactly the same way 

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:21.980
 ie it loosens the nail imbues 

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:23.720
 moisture and 2 and the second active substance 

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:26.210
 kirata fly to 

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:30.680
 this salicylic acid salicylic acid 

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:32.270
 acid breaks chemical bonds in 

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:38.240
 nail plate 

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:40.940
 look and we changed this nail 

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:43.930
 we can take it off easily he acquires 

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:46.220
 such a plasticine shaped such 

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:49.040
 the consistency we can easily remove it from 

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:52.100
 using conventional manicure devices and 

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:55.580
 so today we have the drug legs telitsyn 

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:58.300
 which composition has urea for 

00:05:55.580 --> 00:06:01.700
 loosening nails and salicylic acid 

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:03.410
 for the final dissolution ie 

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:04.160
 what we call called the sofa there 

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:06.680
 action that is 

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:10.310
 and the obligatory reception of antifungal 

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:12.980
 drugs is the main second 

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:16.730
 appointment kirata fly to facilitates 

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:19.590
 treatment of fungal nail infection 

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:21.450
 today we have the preparation of the mice micelles but 

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:25.530
 consist of urine salicylic 

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:27.720
 acid urea softens the nail when 

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:29.570
 the drug he applied salicylic 

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:34.670
 acid breaks bonds 

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:34.670
 but how easily removed from the fingers 

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:42.670
 scarabey
