00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:26.019
 practicing with us you the main thing 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:29.170
 is to give us or we go with the mouse to the 

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:31.810
 action of this tool that is called 

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:36.820
 configuration and they just click 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:40.690
 and we're going to go say topics on topics we're going 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:42.640
 to be able to see different themes or textures 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:44.620
 and the first ones we continue we are 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:48.310
 colorful themes that we can see there 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:52.090

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:59.910
 and high contrast 

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:03.180
 and if I want to know how I look with 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:07.140
 a color forgiveness to my channel simply 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:09.260
 I give the color tone example I'm going to 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.600
 give you clear English 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:14.840
 but simply as it would look in my 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:20.630
 channel we go to twilight and we would see 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:23.899
 how it looks or increases as it should be 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:26.560
 if you like this topic you just have to go 

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:26.560
 there bad 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:35.970
 and twin ok but if we go down a little bit 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:38.579
 we see high definition that are 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:41.939
 textures found the wood in 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:45.950
 desk the beach the mountains and today 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:50.220
 jugs ocean hard oil planets 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:53.509
 lawn and treetops from these 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:56.250
 here mayor if we see here the wood 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:58.289
 it is simply configuring our 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:01.880
 let's wait and be sure in the 

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:05.580
 wood what a nice desk like 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:08.399
 desktop texture and it was set 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:10.940
 but if we give it in mountains it 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:14.510
 configure the climate 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:17.700
 that you're an example they ride it 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:19.950
 the beach being the same 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:22.890
 if we give on the beach this afternoon 100 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:25.590
 90 but if we give graffiti we will 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:29.599
 same because it 's a texture like what 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.599
 we do in lawn occupies trees 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:38.459
 and ready you can also if you like it 

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:41.640
 this any background this is enough of mail 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:44.340
 and gmail and you just leave now 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:47.310
 let's see the next class of topics 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:50.069
 what is custom you can 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:52.799
 customize your topics as you like 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:55.530
 then we can find clear and 

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:58.109
 dark but as well clear dark this 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:00.329
 simple if I do not here in clear can 

00:02:58.109 --> 00:03:03.450
 set up a fund that I have as 

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:06.709
 that I have and I like as of course not 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:06.709
 then I give here 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:12.420
 this fund and gave you select elevates to 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:15.330
 customize and it's going to become the 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:17.130
 background that they obviously select and 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:20.300
 you can personalize it with a photo 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:21.420
 that you have in your mail or on your phone 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:22.980
 mobile 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:26.370
 so what I say here changes the 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:30.290
 background image and he simply had a 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:30.290
 strong then for me font 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:37.530
 or I just go took a picture that you 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:41.580
 negotiation in photos of my team 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:47.240
 select a photo then example 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:49.610
 selected a photo of me whatever 

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:52.970
 and has to select what I do is 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:56.000
 that I think of as a profile background and 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:59.610
 we can see where profiles in depth in 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.550
 yemen and we can see here our fotico 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:04.080
 we can only do them with dark tones 

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:06.630
 that we also simply see it from 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:09.120
 change the image and I'm going to upload 

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:13.590
 image and section or any image 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:16.980
 also and then simply to upload it 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:19.709
 is to convert my background like this but in a way 

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:22.980
 dark you can use it clear or 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:26.280
 drain 7 is already a picture of you to the 

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:30.660
