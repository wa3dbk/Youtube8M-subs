it's<00:01:15.250> like<00:01:15.310> a<00:01:15.430> I<00:01:16.979> don't<00:01:17.979> know<00:01:18.189> what<00:01:18.340> kind<00:01:18.520> of

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:18.549 
it's like a I don't know what kind of

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:21.389 
it's like a I don't know what kind of
what<00:01:19.360> to<00:01:19.390> call<00:01:19.659> it<00:01:19.689> but<00:01:19.890> it's<00:01:20.890> a<00:01:20.950> little<00:01:21.100> rough

00:01:21.389 --> 00:01:21.399 
what to call it but it's a little rough

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:28.170 
what to call it but it's a little rough
I<00:01:24.360> thought<00:01:25.360> it<00:01:25.479> was<00:01:25.539> like<00:01:26.220> shiny<00:01:27.220> or<00:01:27.759> something

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:28.180 
I thought it was like shiny or something

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:30.539 
I thought it was like shiny or something
like<00:01:28.810> tape<00:01:29.170> or<00:01:29.380> something<00:01:29.439> like<00:01:29.619> that<00:01:29.680> because

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:30.549 
like tape or something like that because

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:31.999 
like tape or something like that because
it's<00:01:30.820> supposed<00:01:31.000> to<00:01:31.060> represent<00:01:31.210> duct<00:01:31.750> tape

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
it's supposed to represent duct tape

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.800 
it's supposed to represent duct tape
from<00:01:33.009> what<00:01:33.189> I<00:01:33.220> hear<00:01:33.490> but<00:01:34.710> now<00:01:35.710> it<00:01:35.860> just<00:01:35.890> feels<00:01:36.189> a

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
from what I hear but now it just feels a

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:42.389 
from what I hear but now it just feels a
little<00:01:37.810> rough<00:01:38.369> got<00:01:39.369> like<00:01:39.520> a<00:01:40.649> like<00:01:41.649> a<00:01:41.679> textile
