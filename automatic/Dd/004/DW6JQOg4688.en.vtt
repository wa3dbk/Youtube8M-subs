00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
but I let's a friend of mine my camera

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.090 
but I let's a friend of mine my camera
and<00:00:14.450> he<00:00:15.450> said<00:00:16.260> it<00:00:16.320> was<00:00:16.410> probably<00:00:16.500> good<00:00:16.770> idea

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
and he said it was probably good idea

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.130 
and he said it was probably good idea
maybe<00:00:17.910> to<00:00:18.119> throw<00:00:18.270> something<00:00:18.630> up<00:00:18.690> on<00:00:18.869> the<00:00:18.960> web

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
maybe to throw something up on the web

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.410 
maybe to throw something up on the web
because<00:00:19.619> there's<00:00:20.310> not<00:00:20.460> a<00:00:20.520> lot<00:00:20.730> out<00:00:20.760> there<00:00:21.150> on

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
because there's not a lot out there on

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.230 
because there's not a lot out there on
how<00:00:21.720> to<00:00:21.750> load<00:00:22.050> this<00:00:22.800> particular<00:00:23.130> camera<00:00:23.640> it

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
how to load this particular camera it

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.960 
how to load this particular camera it
even<00:00:24.660> could<00:00:24.779> be<00:00:24.840> a<00:00:24.930> little<00:00:25.080> tricky<00:00:25.170> so<00:00:25.939> but<00:00:26.939> I

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
even could be a little tricky so but I

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.490 
even could be a little tricky so but I
do<00:00:27.119> a<00:00:27.150> little<00:00:27.240> tutorial<00:00:27.480> load<00:00:28.019> it<00:00:28.140> up<00:00:28.230> on<00:00:28.380> the

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
do a little tutorial load it up on the

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.429 
do a little tutorial load it up on the
internet<00:00:29.000> this<00:00:30.000> is<00:00:30.060> a<00:00:30.210> wide<00:00:30.449> Lux<00:00:30.779> camera<00:00:31.230> and

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
internet this is a wide Lux camera and

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.610 
internet this is a wide Lux camera and
it's<00:00:32.250> pretty<00:00:33.030> awesome

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
it's pretty awesome

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.479 
it's pretty awesome
it's<00:00:34.860> panoramic<00:00:35.760> film<00:00:36.329> camera<00:00:37.280> operates<00:00:38.280> on<00:00:38.460> a

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
it's panoramic film camera operates on a

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.020 
it's panoramic film camera operates on a
fixed<00:00:39.059> 35<00:00:39.510> millimeter<00:00:39.989> iron-oxide<00:00:40.500> fix<00:00:41.309> 26

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
fixed 35 millimeter iron-oxide fix 26

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.040 
fixed 35 millimeter iron-oxide fix 26
millimeter<00:00:42.480> lens<00:00:42.860> 35<00:00:43.860> millimeter<00:00:44.309> format<00:00:45.050> and

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
millimeter lens 35 millimeter format and

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.630 
millimeter lens 35 millimeter format and
the<00:00:46.170> way<00:00:46.320> it<00:00:46.440> gets<00:00:46.590> its<00:00:47.450> width<00:00:48.450> is<00:00:48.809> by<00:00:49.640> rotating

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
the way it gets its width is by rotating

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.660 
the way it gets its width is by rotating
turret<00:00:51.140> sort<00:00:52.140> of<00:00:52.199> like<00:00:52.320> that<00:00:52.590> so<00:00:53.219> it's<00:00:53.340> fixed

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
turret sort of like that so it's fixed

00:00:53.670 --> 00:01:00.709 
turret sort of like that so it's fixed
26<00:00:54.210> that<00:00:54.680> rotates<00:00:56.210> across<00:00:59.329> and<00:01:00.329> just<00:01:00.510> to<00:01:00.600> give

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
26 that rotates across and just to give

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.860 
26 that rotates across and just to give
you<00:01:00.809> a<00:01:00.870> little<00:01:01.050> bit<00:01:01.170> of<00:01:01.199> an<00:01:01.320> overview<00:01:02.629> it<00:01:03.629> has

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
you a little bit of an overview it has

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.750 
you a little bit of an overview it has
full<00:01:05.450> aperture<00:01:06.450> range<00:01:07.280> and<00:01:08.280> it<00:01:08.400> has<00:01:08.520> three

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
full aperture range and it has three

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.800 
full aperture range and it has three
shutter<00:01:09.000> speeds<00:01:09.330> so<00:01:11.240> basically<00:01:12.240> this<00:01:12.510> is<00:01:12.570> the

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
shutter speeds so basically this is the

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.350 
shutter speeds so basically this is the
top<00:01:13.020> of<00:01:13.229> it<00:01:13.350> it's<00:01:13.799> a<00:01:13.860> wide<00:01:14.040> Lux<00:01:14.310> f7<00:01:14.909> as<00:01:15.090> you<00:01:15.240> can

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
top of it it's a wide Lux f7 as you can

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.760 
top of it it's a wide Lux f7 as you can
see<00:01:16.340> and<00:01:17.340> your<00:01:18.090> aperture<00:01:18.420> dial<00:01:18.810> is<00:01:19.080> right<00:01:19.290> here

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
see and your aperture dial is right here

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.649 
see and your aperture dial is right here
as<00:01:19.920> opposed<00:01:20.369> to<00:01:20.460> being<00:01:20.670> like<00:01:20.880> on<00:01:21.150> a<00:01:21.180> barrel<00:01:21.570> of

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
as opposed to being like on a barrel of

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:26.030 
as opposed to being like on a barrel of
the<00:01:21.780> lens<00:01:21.950> it's<00:01:22.950> right<00:01:23.220> here<00:01:23.549> and<00:01:24.619> you<00:01:25.619> can<00:01:25.799> see

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
the lens it's right here and you can see

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.630 
the lens it's right here and you can see
there's<00:01:26.280> a<00:01:26.340> little<00:01:27.080> dot<00:01:28.080> it's<00:01:28.950> currently<00:01:29.280> on<00:01:29.369> F

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
there's a little dot it's currently on F

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.170 
there's a little dot it's currently on F
11<00:01:30.090> let's<00:01:30.329> see<00:01:30.509> if<00:01:30.600> you<00:01:30.659> can<00:01:30.810> see<00:01:30.990> them<00:01:32.180> maybe

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
11 let's see if you can see them maybe

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:33.710 
11 let's see if you can see them maybe
not

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
not

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.560 
not
it's<00:01:34.200> currently<00:01:34.439> on<00:01:34.650> F<00:01:34.920> 11<00:01:35.340> there<00:01:35.520> but<00:01:36.329> it<00:01:36.450> can

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
it's currently on F 11 there but it can

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.690 
it's currently on F 11 there but it can
go<00:01:36.689> to<00:01:36.780> f/8<00:01:37.700> five<00:01:38.700> six<00:01:39.150> four<00:01:40.110> and<00:01:40.470> down<00:01:41.310> two<00:01:41.369> to

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
go to f/8 five six four and down two to

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.950 
go to f/8 five six four and down two to
eight<00:01:43.490> generally<00:01:44.490> I<00:01:44.520> try<00:01:44.640> to<00:01:44.909> keep<00:01:45.149> it<00:01:45.299> at<00:01:45.390> f11

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
eight generally I try to keep it at f11

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.690 
eight generally I try to keep it at f11
because<00:01:46.229> the<00:01:46.350> thing<00:01:46.530> about<00:01:46.619> this<00:01:47.399> particular

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
because the thing about this particular

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.690 
because the thing about this particular
lens<00:01:48.240> is<00:01:48.600> it's<00:01:49.409> fixed<00:01:49.860> foot<00:01:50.070> it's<00:01:50.399> a<00:01:50.460> fixed

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
lens is it's fixed foot it's a fixed

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.460 
lens is it's fixed foot it's a fixed
focus<00:01:51.090> and<00:01:51.329> I<00:01:51.450> think<00:01:51.479> it<00:01:51.780> focuses<00:01:52.290> it's

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
focus and I think it focuses it's

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.330 
focus and I think it focuses it's
something<00:01:52.740> like<00:01:52.860> 11<00:01:53.250> feet<00:01:54.920> so<00:01:55.920> you<00:01:55.979> can't

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
something like 11 feet so you can't

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.670 
something like 11 feet so you can't
actually<00:01:56.610> focus<00:01:57.390> the<00:01:57.600> lens<00:01:57.780> the<00:01:58.200> only<00:01:58.500> way<00:01:58.619> you

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
actually focus the lens the only way you

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.420 
actually focus the lens the only way you
can<00:01:58.979> insure<00:01:59.340> focus<00:01:59.909> is<00:02:00.149> to<00:02:00.990> shoot<00:02:01.259> as<00:02:01.530> deep<00:02:02.250> a

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
can insure focus is to shoot as deep a

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.280 
can insure focus is to shoot as deep a
depth<00:02:02.640> of<00:02:02.790> field<00:02:03.000> as<00:02:03.149> you<00:02:03.240> can

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
depth of field as you can

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:09.200 
depth of field as you can
and<00:02:04.610> let<00:02:05.610> that<00:02:05.820> get<00:02:06.570> your<00:02:06.720> focus<00:02:07.050> in<00:02:07.260> um<00:02:08.210> so

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:09.210 
and let that get your focus in um so

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:11.360 
and let that get your focus in um so
that's<00:02:09.360> basically<00:02:10.140> gonna<00:02:10.350> give<00:02:10.590> you<00:02:10.800> a<00:02:11.010> kitty

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
that's basically gonna give you a kitty

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.330 
that's basically gonna give you a kitty
that's<00:02:12.000> basically<00:02:12.390> gonna<00:02:12.600> give<00:02:12.870> you<00:02:13.110> f<00:02:13.680> 11<00:02:14.160> and

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
that's basically gonna give you f 11 and

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.150 
that's basically gonna give you f 11 and
I<00:02:14.460> try<00:02:14.640> to<00:02:14.700> keep<00:02:14.910> it<00:02:15.120> at<00:02:15.210> f/11<00:02:15.810> and<00:02:16.160> your

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
I try to keep it at f/11 and your

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.820 
I try to keep it at f/11 and your
shutter<00:02:17.370> speeds<00:02:17.780> are<00:02:18.780> basically<00:02:19.650> right<00:02:19.890> here

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:21.830 
shutter speeds are basically right here

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:24.650 
shutter speeds are basically right here
and<00:02:22.830> you<00:02:23.130> have<00:02:23.160> I'm<00:02:24.060> not<00:02:24.180> great<00:02:24.420> with<00:02:24.450> this

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
and you have I'm not great with this

125th of a second you know I'm 125th of

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.980 
125th of a second you know I'm 125th of
a<00:02:37.680> second<00:02:38.100> that's<00:02:38.220> uh<00:02:38.550> that's<00:02:39.390> good<00:02:39.660> Street

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:39.990 
a second that's uh that's good Street

a second that's uh that's good Street
shooters<00:02:40.340> two<00:02:41.340> fifty-two<00:02:41.700> these<00:02:42.300> are<00:02:42.450> these

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
shooters two fifty-two these are these

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.410 
shooters two fifty-two these are these

speeds<00:02:45.420> and<00:02:45.660> then<00:02:46.320> you<00:02:46.410> have<00:02:46.530> 15th<00:02:47.000> and<00:02:48.000> the

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
speeds and then you have 15th and the

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.550 
speeds and then you have 15th and the
15th<00:02:48.660> is<00:02:49.070> remarkably<00:02:50.840> handhold<00:02:51.840> Abul<00:02:52.170> because

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
15th is remarkably handhold Abul because

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.230 
15th is remarkably handhold Abul because
it<00:02:52.770> takes<00:02:53.070> on<00:02:53.340> a<00:02:53.370> 15th

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:54.240 
it takes on a 15th

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:58.400 
it takes on a 15th
it<00:02:54.810> takes<00:02:55.200> its<00:02:55.440> is<00:02:55.620> exposure<00:02:57.020> it<00:02:58.020> would<00:02:58.200> seem

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
it takes its is exposure it would seem

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:00.350 
it takes its is exposure it would seem
pretty<00:02:58.650> slow<00:02:59.040> but<00:02:59.340> because<00:03:00.000> it's<00:03:00.180> only

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
pretty slow but because it's only

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.280 
pretty slow but because it's only
exposing<00:03:01.260> a<00:03:01.410> sliver<00:03:02.370> at<00:03:02.760> any<00:03:03.360> given<00:03:03.690> time<00:03:03.990> on

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
exposing a sliver at any given time on

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:07.250 
exposing a sliver at any given time on
the<00:03:04.620> film<00:03:05.270> that<00:03:06.270> means<00:03:06.450> you<00:03:06.570> could<00:03:06.720> really<00:03:06.959> get

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
the film that means you could really get

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.100 
the film that means you could really get
not<00:03:08.010> only<00:03:08.040> the<00:03:08.730> ability<00:03:09.239> to<00:03:09.330> handhold

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
not only the ability to handhold

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:12.880 
not only the ability to handhold
without<00:03:10.739> too<00:03:10.890> much<00:03:11.010> camera<00:03:11.430> shake<00:03:11.640> at<00:03:11.880> 15th

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:12.890 
without too much camera shake at 15th

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:15.380 
without too much camera shake at 15th
but<00:03:13.890> you<00:03:13.950> can<00:03:14.070> also<00:03:14.220> get<00:03:14.400> really<00:03:14.880> interesting

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
but you can also get really interesting

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:17.330 
but you can also get really interesting
effects<00:03:15.690> if<00:03:15.840> somebody<00:03:16.200> drags<00:03:16.830> their<00:03:17.070> hand

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
effects if somebody drags their hand

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.850 
effects if somebody drags their hand
across<00:03:17.610> either<00:03:18.120> while<00:03:19.080> the<00:03:19.380> target<00:03:19.739> is

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:19.860 
across either while the target is

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:21.979 
across either while the target is
rotating<00:03:20.489> it'll<00:03:20.700> stretch<00:03:21.180> things<00:03:21.480> out<00:03:21.720> so<00:03:21.900> you

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
rotating it'll stretch things out so you

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:23.360 
rotating it'll stretch things out so you
might<00:03:22.140> have<00:03:22.260> a<00:03:22.320> perfectly<00:03:22.800> clear<00:03:23.100> background

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
might have a perfectly clear background

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:26.300 
might have a perfectly clear background
very<00:03:24.360> crisp<00:03:24.690> very<00:03:24.810> sharp<00:03:25.290> and<00:03:25.500> then<00:03:25.950> this<00:03:26.100> sort

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
very crisp very sharp and then this sort

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:30.050 
very crisp very sharp and then this sort
of<00:03:26.459> a<00:03:26.790> morphic<00:03:27.769> stretched<00:03:28.850> surrealist<00:03:29.850> that

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
of a morphic stretched surrealist that

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.630 
of a morphic stretched surrealist that
kind<00:03:30.269> of<00:03:30.330> vibe<00:03:31.070> it's<00:03:32.070> just<00:03:32.280> an<00:03:32.400> interesting

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:32.640 
kind of vibe it's just an interesting

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.820 
kind of vibe it's just an interesting
camera<00:03:33.239> and<00:03:33.930> you<00:03:34.050> can<00:03:34.170> do<00:03:34.260> a<00:03:34.290> lot<00:03:34.500> of<00:03:34.530> different

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:34.830 
camera and you can do a lot of different

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:36.710 
camera and you can do a lot of different
things<00:03:34.920> with<00:03:35.160> it<00:03:35.190> but<00:03:35.489> so<00:03:36.120> basically<00:03:36.300> if

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
things with it but so basically if

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.000 
things with it but so basically if
you're<00:03:36.840> three<00:03:37.050> shutter<00:03:37.260> speeds<00:03:37.590> there<00:03:37.830> you

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
you're three shutter speeds there you

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:41.360 
you're three shutter speeds there you
have<00:03:38.130> 15<00:03:38.660> 125<00:03:39.660> 250<00:03:40.110> and<00:03:40.620> you<00:03:40.950> get<00:03:41.100> your<00:03:41.220> full

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
have 15 125 250 and you get your full

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:44.600 
have 15 125 250 and you get your full
range<00:03:41.580> of<00:03:41.930> aperture<00:03:42.930> right<00:03:43.140> there<00:03:43.610> shutter

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:44.610

release<00:03:45.380> wine<00:03:46.700> which<00:03:47.700> is<00:03:47.730> my<00:03:48.000> biggest

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:48.239 
release wine which is my biggest

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:50.690 
release wine which is my biggest
complaint<00:03:48.720> it's<00:03:48.840> very<00:03:49.110> noisy<00:03:49.350> so<00:03:49.709> while<00:03:50.550> the

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 
complaint it's very noisy so while the

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:57.140 
complaint it's very noisy so while the
exposure<00:03:51.590> is<00:03:52.590> very<00:03:53.220> quiet<00:03:54.800> relatively<00:03:56.150> that's

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
exposure is very quiet relatively that's

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:00.410 
exposure is very quiet relatively that's
what<00:03:57.390> gives<00:03:57.570> you<00:03:57.720> away<00:03:57.959> yeah<00:03:58.890> so<00:03:59.820> you've<00:04:00.209> got

what gives you away yeah so you've got
