good day this is musketeer here I'm

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:04.519 
good day this is musketeer here I'm
going<00:00:02.970> to<00:00:03.060> explain<00:00:03.570> why<00:00:03.959> electric<00:00:04.290> powered

00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:04.529 
going to explain why electric powered

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:06.650 
going to explain why electric powered
cars<00:00:04.859> or<00:00:05.100> a<00:00:05.130> bad<00:00:05.370> idea<00:00:05.609> you<00:00:06.210> might<00:00:06.359> be<00:00:06.509> thinking

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:06.660

cars or a bad idea you might be thinking
did<00:00:07.440> he<00:00:07.560> just<00:00:07.770> say<00:00:07.980> a<00:00:08.010> bad<00:00:08.280> idea<00:00:08.490> yes<00:00:09.300> I<00:00:09.570> did

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
did he just say a bad idea yes I did
