00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
as far as this games concerned they've

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
still averaged 464 yards per game even

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:47.690 
still averaged 464 yards per game even
though<00:01:46.409> you<00:01:46.470> throw<00:01:46.740> in<00:01:46.920> that<00:01:46.950> tough<00:01:47.250> schedule

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
though you throw in that tough schedule

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.520 
though you throw in that tough schedule
talking<00:01:48.060> about<00:01:48.240> the<00:01:48.329> Q<00:01:48.540> solvents<00:01:49.020> they<00:01:49.380> own

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
talking about the Q solvents they own

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.770 
talking about the Q solvents they own
the<00:01:49.680> nation's<00:01:50.040> 20th<00:01:50.700> ranked<00:01:50.939> passing<00:01:51.420> offense

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
the nation's 20th ranked passing offense

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.600 
the nation's 20th ranked passing offense
so<00:01:52.320> if<00:01:52.439> they're<00:01:52.560> able<00:01:52.680> to<00:01:52.829> get<00:01:52.979> that<00:01:53.070> efficient

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
so if they're able to get that efficient

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.100 
so if they're able to get that efficient
4<00:01:53.790> yards<00:01:54.149> per<00:01:54.329> pop<00:01:54.509> when<00:01:54.689> they<00:01:54.780> carry<00:01:54.990> the

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
4 yards per pop when they carry the

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.810 
4 yards per pop when they carry the
football<00:01:55.470> I<00:01:55.649> think<00:01:56.100> it<00:01:56.189> just<00:01:56.219> makes<00:01:56.520> an<00:01:56.670> ass

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
football I think it just makes an ass

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.130 
football I think it just makes an ass
even<00:01:57.030> this<00:01:57.299> passing<00:01:57.689> game<00:01:57.840> even<00:01:58.110> more

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
even this passing game even more

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.020 
even this passing game even more
dangerous<00:01:58.680> against<00:01:59.280> this<00:01:59.369> Louisville<00:01:59.790> squad

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030
