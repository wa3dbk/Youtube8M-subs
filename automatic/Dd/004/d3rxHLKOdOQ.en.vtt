00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
audio codes that you get during the

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.630 
audio codes that you get during the
Easter<00:00:16.379> egg<00:00:16.560> I'm<00:00:16.980> opening<00:00:17.279> this<00:00:17.430> as<00:00:17.609> a

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
Easter egg I'm opening this as a

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.130 
Easter egg I'm opening this as a
separate<00:00:17.970> video<00:00:18.210> so<00:00:18.270> people<00:00:18.690> don't<00:00:18.960> get

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
separate video so people don't get

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.019 
separate video so people don't get
spoiled<00:00:19.470> if<00:00:19.710> they<00:00:19.890> don't<00:00:20.100> want<00:00:20.250> to<00:00:20.310> in<00:00:20.670> the

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
come from the Easter egg video I'll have

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.529 
come from the Easter egg video I'll have
that<00:00:25.320> linked<00:00:25.710> when<00:00:25.920> I<00:00:25.949> upload<00:00:26.400> it<00:00:26.430> but<00:00:27.000> this<00:00:27.390> is

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
that linked when I upload it but this is

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.179 
that linked when I upload it but this is
pretty<00:00:27.689> much<00:00:27.779> the<00:00:28.050> process<00:00:28.170> you<00:00:28.560> go<00:00:28.740> to<00:00:28.800> these

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
pretty much the process you go to these

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.939 
pretty much the process you go to these
codes<00:00:29.460> after<00:00:29.730> you<00:00:30.060> do<00:00:30.210> certain<00:00:30.480> steps<00:00:30.840> to<00:00:31.830> the

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
codes after you do certain steps to the

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.620 
codes after you do certain steps to the
Easter<00:00:32.250> egg<00:00:32.460> the<00:00:32.730> Easter<00:00:32.969> egg<00:00:33.090> again<00:00:33.329> will<00:00:33.510> be

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
Easter egg the Easter egg again will be

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.470 
Easter egg the Easter egg again will be
linked<00:00:34.200> very<00:00:34.350> soon<00:00:34.680> and<00:00:34.890> you<00:00:35.610> put<00:00:35.820> in<00:00:35.969> 3<00:00:36.270> codes

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
linked very soon and you put in 3 codes

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.020 
linked very soon and you put in 3 codes
101<00:00:37.170> is<00:00:37.410> the<00:00:37.530> first<00:00:37.890> code<00:00:38.100> I<00:00:38.340> will<00:00:38.760> have<00:00:38.879> these

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
101 is the first code I will have these

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.990 
101 is the first code I will have these
all<00:00:39.480> these<00:00:39.829> numbers<00:00:40.829> in<00:00:41.070> the<00:00:41.460> description

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
all these numbers in the description

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.350 
all these numbers in the description
the<00:00:42.360> second<00:00:42.719> code<00:00:42.870> is<00:00:43.110> 872<00:00:43.829> and<00:00:44.190> after<00:00:45.059> you<00:00:45.180> do

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
the second code is 872 and after you do

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.500 
the second code is 872 and after you do
that<00:00:45.539> the<00:00:45.870> next<00:00:46.050> one<00:00:46.260> is<00:00:46.430> 386<00:00:47.430> and<00:00:47.610> the<00:00:48.300> one

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
that the next one is 386 and the one

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.840 
that the next one is 386 and the one
after<00:00:48.660> that<00:00:48.840> is<00:00:48.960> 481<00:00:49.860> I'll<00:00:50.129> have<00:00:50.280> that<00:00:50.489> on<00:00:50.640> the

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
after that is 481 I'll have that on the

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.729 
after that is 481 I'll have that on the
screen<00:00:51.180> and<00:00:51.480> in<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:51.719> description<00:00:51.840> now<00:00:52.379> I

where<00:00:54.809> your<00:00:54.930> body<00:00:55.170> is<00:00:55.379> I<00:00:55.410> actually<00:00:55.739> managed<00:00:56.309> to

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
where your body is I actually managed to

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.700 
where your body is I actually managed to
die<00:00:56.610> because<00:00:56.940> I<00:00:57.360> couldn't<00:00:57.840> reach<00:00:58.050> my<00:00:58.079> body<00:00:58.440> but

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
die because I couldn't reach my body but

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.709 
die because I couldn't reach my body but
it<00:00:59.190> doesn't<00:00:59.460> really<00:00:59.550> matter<00:00:59.760> after<00:01:00.239> this<00:01:00.539> step

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719
