 open it comes out like a bouquet of flowers and 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.520

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.200

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:42.320

 i 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:56.060
 The first thing we will do is double 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.060
 half a thick sheet, charcoal size 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:10.150
 then we will mark the double 2 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:13.110
 points 1 to 9.5 centimeters and another to the 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:13.110
 19 centimeters 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:21.770
 now horizontally we will mark in 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:24.679
 base to those two points 15 centimeters and 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:26.929
 the one down to 2.5 centimeters 

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:29.530
 next is to cut these lines the 

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:29.530
 dotted 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:42.930
 and then we will mark a fold with the 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:46.610
 dull part of the scissors or a 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.610
 punch and a ruler 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:01.840
 we mark well we unfold we mark another 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:05.130
 cutting line to cut and again 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.130
 we mark that fold 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:12.270
 now we push forward and 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.270
 we mark the folds in this way 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:33.400
 there must be something like that 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:39.460
 to decorate what is the bouquet we fold 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:42.040
 a piece of decorative paper and 

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:44.400
 we place aligned the folds of this 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.400
 way 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.300

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:09.940
 we mark these trimmed lines and 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:14.370
 something like that 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:14.370
 we turn to the other side and stick 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:27.390
 the next thing is to make the flowers for 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:29.640

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:32.940

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:35.400
 green we will also cut circles of 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:37.950
 different sizes of different shades 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:40.140
 of pink ccoo paper and different 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:42.690
 sizes the circles will simulate 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:45.530
 Flowers sticks on each other combines 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:45.530
