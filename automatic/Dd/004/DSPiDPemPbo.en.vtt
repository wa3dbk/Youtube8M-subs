chopped up frozen banana which are
prepared<00:00:09.480> 24<00:00:10.110> hours<00:00:10.380> ahead

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:12.310 
prepared 24 hours ahead

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:15.460 
prepared 24 hours ahead
the<00:00:13.310> first<00:00:13.580> step<00:00:13.730> is<00:00:13.940> to<00:00:14.120> add<00:00:14.270> half<00:00:15.170> a<00:00:15.290> cup<00:00:15.440> of

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:15.470 
the first step is to add half a cup of

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:17.050 
the first step is to add half a cup of
cottage<00:00:15.710> cheese<00:00:15.830> into<00:00:16.280> the<00:00:16.400> blender

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:17.060 
cottage cheese into the blender

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:18.610 
cottage cheese into the blender
like<00:00:17.570> I<00:00:17.660> said<00:00:17.780> cottage<00:00:18.050> cheese<00:00:18.230> is<00:00:18.380> really

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:18.620 
like I said cottage cheese is really

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:20.620 
like I said cottage cheese is really
high<00:00:18.800> in<00:00:18.830> protein<00:00:19.310> it's<00:00:19.520> got<00:00:19.700> all<00:00:20.270> your

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:20.630 
high in protein it's got all your

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:22.150 
high in protein it's got all your
essential<00:00:20.960> amino<00:00:21.110> acids<00:00:21.619> needed<00:00:21.920> to<00:00:22.010> qualify

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:22.160 
essential amino acids needed to qualify

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.310 
essential amino acids needed to qualify
as<00:00:22.670> a<00:00:22.700> whole<00:00:23.000> protein<00:00:23.420> and<00:00:23.630> it's<00:00:23.930> also<00:00:24.080> really

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:24.320 
as a whole protein and it's also really

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:25.960 
as a whole protein and it's also really
high<00:00:24.560> in<00:00:24.650> calcium<00:00:24.920> as<00:00:25.190> well<00:00:25.369> which<00:00:25.580> means<00:00:25.820> it's

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:25.970 
high in calcium as well which means it's

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:30.670 
high in calcium as well which means it's
really<00:00:26.000> good<00:00:26.300> for<00:00:26.420> your<00:00:26.510> bones<00:00:26.660> the<00:00:29.530> next<00:00:30.530> step

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:30.680 
really good for your bones the next step

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:32.140 
really good for your bones the next step
is<00:00:30.830> to<00:00:30.950> add<00:00:31.039> two<00:00:31.340> whole<00:00:31.520> cups<00:00:31.789> of<00:00:31.970> frozen

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:32.150 
is to add two whole cups of frozen

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:34.900 
is to add two whole cups of frozen
banana<00:00:32.629> banana<00:00:33.590> has<00:00:33.830> really<00:00:34.309> high<00:00:34.430> levels<00:00:34.790> of

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:34.910 
banana banana has really high levels of

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:37.330 
banana banana has really high levels of
vitamin<00:00:35.420> b6<00:00:35.600> which<00:00:36.230> actually<00:00:36.500> helps<00:00:36.770> to<00:00:37.190> aid

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:37.340 
vitamin b6 which actually helps to aid

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:40.210 
vitamin b6 which actually helps to aid
in<00:00:37.520> weight<00:00:37.550> loss<00:00:38.260> now<00:00:39.260> I'm<00:00:39.410> adding<00:00:39.559> one<00:00:40.040> whole

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:40.220 
in weight loss now I'm adding one whole

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:43.210 
in weight loss now I'm adding one whole
cup<00:00:40.370> of<00:00:40.610> frozen<00:00:40.850> strawberries<00:00:41.300> and<00:00:42.190> 1/3<00:00:43.190> cup

cup of frozen strawberries and 1/3 cup
of<00:00:43.699> frozen<00:00:43.970> blueberries<00:00:44.330> really<00:00:44.989> high<00:00:45.140> in

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:45.260 
of frozen blueberries really high in

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:46.990 
of frozen blueberries really high in
antioxidants<00:00:45.980> so<00:00:46.100> again<00:00:46.400> really<00:00:46.610> good<00:00:46.850> for

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:47.000 
antioxidants so again really good for

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.049 
antioxidants so again really good for
you<00:00:47.120> so<00:00:48.460> that's<00:00:49.460> what<00:00:49.580> it's<00:00:49.699> gonna<00:00:49.790> look<00:00:49.879> like

00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:50.059

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:54.850 
you so that's what it's gonna look like
blended<00:00:50.900> it<00:00:51.019> all<00:00:51.170> up<00:00:53.320> now<00:00:54.320> you<00:00:54.379> want<00:00:54.650> to<00:00:54.710> blend

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:54.860 
blended it all up now you want to blend

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:56.950 
blended it all up now you want to blend
for<00:00:55.010> at<00:00:55.250> least<00:00:55.460> two<00:00:55.909> minutes<00:00:56.030> it's<00:00:56.540> gonna<00:00:56.780> look

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:56.960 
for at least two minutes it's gonna look

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.640 
for at least two minutes it's gonna look
really<00:00:57.199> lumpy<00:00:57.650> and<00:00:58.600> thick<00:00:59.600> at<00:00:59.809> first<00:01:00.110> but<00:01:00.379> just

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:00.650 
really lumpy and thick at first but just

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:01.930 
really lumpy and thick at first but just
give<00:01:00.830> it<00:01:00.920> some<00:01:00.949> time<00:01:01.100> and<00:01:01.519> let<00:01:01.670> it<00:01:01.760> blend

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:01.940

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:21.460 
give it some time and let it blend
through

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:21.470 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:23.740 

cool<00:01:22.190> and<00:01:22.460> that's<00:01:22.700> it<00:01:23.000> I'll<00:01:23.300> just<00:01:23.540> show<00:01:23.720> you

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:25.780 
cool and that's it I'll just show you
what<00:01:24.470> it<00:01:24.590> will<00:01:24.710> look<00:01:24.890> like<00:01:24.950> so<00:01:25.460> that's<00:01:25.640> the

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:25.790 
what it will look like so that's the

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:28.540 
what it will look like so that's the
consistency<00:01:26.510> we're<00:01:26.720> after<00:01:27.170> it<00:01:27.530> is<00:01:28.040> really

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:28.550 
consistency we're after it is really

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:30.610 
consistency we're after it is really
thick<00:01:28.790> nice<00:01:29.090> and<00:01:29.300> smooth<00:01:29.660> and<00:01:30.020> I'll<00:01:30.470> just

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:30.620 
thick nice and smooth and I'll just

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:32.650 
thick nice and smooth and I'll just
scoop<00:01:30.920> into<00:01:31.100> a<00:01:31.190> bolster<00:01:31.610> so<00:01:31.790> you<00:01:31.850> can<00:01:32.030> see<00:01:32.330> how

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:32.660 
scoop into a bolster so you can see how

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:34.480 
scoop into a bolster so you can see how
hard<00:01:32.930> it<00:01:33.080> is<00:01:33.170> it's<00:01:33.410> it's<00:01:33.620> pretty<00:01:33.920> soft<00:01:34.160> as<00:01:34.370> you

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490 
hard it is it's it's pretty soft as you

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:36.130 
hard it is it's it's pretty soft as you
can<00:01:34.610> see<00:01:34.820> it's<00:01:34.970> sort<00:01:35.180> of<00:01:35.240> like<00:01:35.390> a<00:01:35.570> soft-serve

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:36.140 
can see it's sort of like a soft-serve

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.880 
can see it's sort of like a soft-serve
sorbet<00:01:37.060> consistency<00:01:38.230> and<00:01:39.230> it<00:01:39.440> makes<00:01:39.620> about

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:39.890 
sorbet consistency and it makes about

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:42.640 
sorbet consistency and it makes about
four<00:01:40.340> to<00:01:40.460> five<00:01:40.490> scoops<00:01:41.120> or<00:01:41.750> at<00:01:42.080> least<00:01:42.350> at<00:01:42.590> least

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:42.650 
four to five scoops or at least at least

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:48.940 
four to five scoops or at least at least
five<00:01:43.010> scoops<00:01:43.310> I'd<00:01:43.490> say<00:01:46.000> and<00:01:47.530> that's<00:01:48.530> the<00:01:48.770> final

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950 
five scoops I'd say and that's the final

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:50.650 
five scoops I'd say and that's the final
result<00:01:49.370> now<00:01:49.460> I<00:01:49.550> don't<00:01:49.640> have<00:01:49.940> that<00:01:50.240> much<00:01:50.450> in<00:01:50.630> one

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:50.660 
result now I don't have that much in one

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:52.630 
result now I don't have that much in one
sitting<00:01:51.080> I'll<00:01:51.260> show<00:01:51.470> you<00:01:51.530> my<00:01:51.950> serving<00:01:52.400> size

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:52.640 
sitting I'll show you my serving size

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.240 
sitting I'll show you my serving size
which<00:01:52.880> is<00:01:53.030> about<00:01:53.060> a<00:01:53.479> scoop<00:01:53.869> and<00:01:54.110> a<00:01:54.170> half<00:01:54.380> and<00:01:54.710> I

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:55.250 
which is about a scoop and a half and I

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:57.820 
which is about a scoop and a half and I
have<00:01:55.400> in<00:01:55.580> this<00:01:55.700> little<00:01:55.880> glass<00:01:56.150> here<00:01:56.479> so<00:01:57.260> the

have in this little glass here so the
recipe<00:01:58.010> it<00:01:58.670> makes<00:01:59.000> about<00:01:59.150> four<00:01:59.600> servings<00:01:59.840> each

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590
