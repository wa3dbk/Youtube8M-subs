valve and then it goes up and then this

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.719 
valve and then it goes up and then this
is<00:01:08.010> where<00:01:08.189> I'll<00:01:08.280> be<00:01:08.310> installing<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:10.400> tank<00:01:11.400> on

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
is where I'll be installing the tank on

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.870 
is where I'll be installing the tank on
the<00:01:11.939> cold<00:01:12.630> water<00:01:12.840> inlet<00:01:13.460> it's<00:01:14.460> important<00:01:14.820> to

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
the cold water inlet it's important to

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.950 
the cold water inlet it's important to
install<00:01:15.119> after<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:15.780> shut-off<00:01:16.290> valve<00:01:16.619> but

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:17.960 
install after the shut-off valve but

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:24.100 
install after the shut-off valve but
before<00:01:18.960> you<00:01:19.320> get<00:01:19.439> to<00:01:19.619> the<00:01:19.680> water<00:01:19.860> heater

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.110 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:27.550 

my<00:01:24.620> guess<00:01:24.860> looks<00:01:25.250> good<00:01:25.520> I<00:01:25.550> do<00:01:25.820> this<00:01:26.240> open<00:01:26.560> water

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.560 
my guess looks good I do this open water

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.050 
my guess looks good I do this open water
test<00:01:28.250> and<00:01:28.820> it<00:01:29.180> passed<00:01:29.510> and<00:01:30.290> then<00:01:30.860> the<00:01:31.130> plumbing

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.060 
test and it passed and then the plumbing

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:37.120 
test and it passed and then the plumbing
is<00:01:32.320> good<00:01:33.320> no<00:01:33.500> leaks<00:01:33.530> or<00:01:33.920> anything<00:01:34.870> now<00:01:35.870> I<00:01:36.260> test

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.130 
is good no leaks or anything now I test

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.410 
is good no leaks or anything now I test
the<00:01:37.370> water<00:01:37.730> pressure<00:01:38.300> I<00:01:38.750> get<00:01:39.320> this<00:01:40.420> water

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:41.420 
the water pressure I get this water

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.420 
the water pressure I get this water
pressure<00:01:41.810> tester<00:01:42.530> at<00:01:42.650> the<00:01:42.830> hardware<00:01:43.190> store

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:43.430 
pressure tester at the hardware store

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:47.110 
pressure tester at the hardware store
and<00:01:43.810> I<00:01:44.810> can<00:01:45.080> turn<00:01:45.440> you<00:01:45.800> can<00:01:46.100> use<00:01:46.250> like<00:01:46.490> if<00:01:47.000> you

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:47.120 
and I can turn you can use like if you

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.990 
and I can turn you can use like if you
have<00:01:47.240> a<00:01:47.320> laundry<00:01:48.320> hose<00:01:48.890> and<00:01:49.460> disconnect<00:01:49.940> that

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.000 
have a laundry hose and disconnect that

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.050 
have a laundry hose and disconnect that
and<00:01:50.300> put<00:01:50.540> it<00:01:50.740> put<00:01:51.740> on<00:01:51.890> that<00:01:52.100> or<00:01:52.730> you<00:01:52.790> could<00:01:52.940> put

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.060 
and put it put on that or you could put

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:56.890 
and put it put on that or you could put
it<00:01:53.180> out<00:01:53.330> on<00:01:53.780> a<00:01:53.890> garden<00:01:54.890> hose<00:01:55.040> outside<00:01:55.900> your

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:56.900 
it out on a garden hose outside your

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:00.640 
it out on a garden hose outside your
house<00:01:57.020> but<00:01:57.560> anyway<00:01:58.370> you<00:01:58.700> know<00:01:59.320> to<00:02:00.320> find<00:02:00.500> the

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:00.650 
house but anyway you know to find the

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:03.340 
house but anyway you know to find the
water<00:02:00.800> pressure<00:02:01.130> of<00:02:02.120> the<00:02:02.480> house<00:02:02.660> my<00:02:03.140> water

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 
water pressure of the house my water

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:08.320 
water pressure of the house my water
pressure<00:02:03.620> is<00:02:03.830> 70<00:02:04.280> so<00:02:05.180> I<00:02:05.660> am<00:02:06.200> okay<00:02:06.680> now<00:02:07.330> this

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
pressure is 70 so I am okay now this

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.460 
pressure is 70 so I am okay now this
safety<00:02:08.690> tank<00:02:08.929> comes<00:02:09.320> pre<00:02:09.710> pre<00:02:10.520> pre<00:02:10.730> pressure

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
safety tank comes pre pre pre pressure

charged<00:02:12.470> at<00:02:12.710> 40<00:02:13.400> psi<00:02:14.590> so<00:02:15.590> inside<00:02:15.950> this<00:02:16.130> has<00:02:16.430> a

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:16.460 
charged at 40 psi so inside this has a

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:23.260 
charged at 40 psi so inside this has a

rubber material that is inflated kind

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:25.780 
rubber material that is inflated kind
like<00:02:23.360> a<00:02:23.390> glue<00:02:23.630> and<00:02:23.900> then<00:02:24.520> when<00:02:25.520> your<00:02:25.640> water

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
like a glue and then when your water

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:28.840 
like a glue and then when your water
heater<00:02:26.000> heats<00:02:26.510> up<00:02:26.690> water<00:02:27.310> that<00:02:28.310> water<00:02:28.489> has<00:02:28.700> to

heater heats up water that water has to

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:32.199 
heater heats up water that water has to
go<00:02:28.880> somewhere<00:02:29.000> so<00:02:30.820> without<00:02:31.820> one<00:02:32.000> of<00:02:32.090> these

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:32.209 
go somewhere so without one of these

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:35.979 
go somewhere so without one of these
tanks<00:02:32.590> it<00:02:33.590> puts<00:02:34.520> a<00:02:34.580> lot<00:02:34.700> of<00:02:34.730> stress<00:02:35.360> on<00:02:35.660> your

00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:35.989 
tanks it puts a lot of stress on your

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:39.720

when<00:02:46.100> you<00:02:46.220> saw<00:02:46.400> one<00:02:46.580> these<00:02:47.260> when<00:02:48.260> water<00:02:48.680> gets

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:48.830 
when you saw one these when water gets

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:51.400 
when you saw one these when water gets
heated<00:02:49.040> up<00:02:49.310> it<00:02:49.760> allows<00:02:50.060> that<00:02:50.330> pressure<00:02:50.630> extra

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:51.410 
heated up it allows that pressure extra

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:53.860 
heated up it allows that pressure extra
pressure<00:02:51.590> to<00:02:51.709> go<00:02:51.950> inside<00:02:52.489> inside<00:02:53.209> to<00:02:53.390> here<00:02:53.630> and

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
pressure to go inside inside to here and

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:58.060 
pressure to go inside inside to here and
can<00:02:55.270> they<00:02:56.270> push<00:02:56.510> it<00:02:56.660> down<00:02:56.870> the<00:02:57.380> water<00:02:57.560> pushes

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:58.070 
can they push it down the water pushes

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:01.510 
can they push it down the water pushes
down<00:02:58.220> the<00:02:58.280> rubber<00:02:58.910> material<00:02:59.450> I<00:03:00.370> turned<00:03:01.370> off<00:03:01.489> my

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:01.520 
down the rubber material I turned off my

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:05.740 
down the rubber material I turned off my
water<00:03:01.850> and<00:03:02.090> drain<00:03:02.360> it<00:03:02.540> and<00:03:02.890> I<00:03:04.510> remove<00:03:05.510> the

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750 
water and drain it and I remove the

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:10.390 
water and drain it and I remove the
stuff<00:03:06.560> on<00:03:06.739> the<00:03:06.890> cold<00:03:07.520> water<00:03:09.100> now<00:03:10.100> what<00:03:10.280> I'm

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 
stuff on the cold water now what I'm

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.110 
stuff on the cold water now what I'm
going<00:03:10.520> to<00:03:10.610> do<00:03:10.730> take<00:03:11.480> the<00:03:11.660> safety<00:03:12.080> tank<00:03:12.520> and<00:03:13.520> I

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120 
going to do take the safety tank and I

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:19.980 
going to do take the safety tank and I
put<00:03:15.020> teflon<00:03:15.350> tape<00:03:15.680> and<00:03:16.270> piped<00:03:17.270> up<00:03:17.450> on<00:03:17.600> it

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:19.990 

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:26.880 

I'm<00:03:20.990> just<00:03:21.410> going<00:03:21.770> to<00:03:24.490> install<00:03:25.490> it<00:03:25.670> on<00:03:25.850> this

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:26.890 
I'm just going to install it on this

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:30.550 
I'm just going to install it on this
stub<00:03:27.890> like<00:03:28.340> so<00:03:28.550> and<00:03:29.390> you<00:03:29.630> want<00:03:29.780> to<00:03:29.900> always<00:03:30.260> make

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:30.560 
stub like so and you want to always make

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:32.440 
stub like so and you want to always make
sure<00:03:30.590> that<00:03:31.040> when<00:03:31.700> you<00:03:31.790> install<00:03:32.120> it<00:03:32.240> you

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:32.450 
sure that when you install it you

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:35.560 
sure that when you install it you
install<00:03:33.320> it<00:03:33.440> on<00:03:33.650> a<00:03:33.760> horizontal<00:03:34.760> runoff<00:03:35.360> pipe

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:35.570 
install it on a horizontal runoff pipe

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:40.510 
install it on a horizontal runoff pipe
not<00:03:36.020> a<00:03:36.080> not<00:03:36.650> a<00:03:36.680> vertical<00:03:38.590> it<00:03:39.590> takes<00:03:39.800> installing

not a not a vertical it takes installing

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:43.030 
not a not a vertical it takes installing
the<00:03:40.640> water<00:03:40.790> back<00:03:41.090> on<00:03:41.530> looks<00:03:42.530> good<00:03:42.800> in<00:03:42.950> the

the water back on looks good in the
leaks<00:03:43.250> one<00:03:44.180> last<00:03:44.360> thing<00:03:44.480> we're<00:03:44.600> going<00:03:44.690> to<00:03:44.780> do

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:44.840 
leaks one last thing we're going to do

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:48.160 
leaks one last thing we're going to do
we're<00:03:45.080> going<00:03:45.170> to<00:03:45.230> take<00:03:45.290> this<00:03:45.890> a<00:03:46.870> tire<00:03:47.870> pressure

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:48.170 
we're going to take this a tire pressure

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:52.330 
we're going to take this a tire pressure
gauge<00:03:48.709> and<00:03:49.010> we're<00:03:50.000> going<00:03:50.120> to<00:03:50.920> pop<00:03:51.920> it<00:03:52.070> on<00:03:52.190> this

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:52.340 
gauge and we're going to pop it on this

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:54.820 
gauge and we're going to pop it on this
little<00:03:52.580> battle<00:03:53.270> here<00:03:53.450> to<00:03:53.959> make<00:03:54.320> sure<00:03:54.530> that

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:54.830 
little battle here to make sure that

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:58.900 
little battle here to make sure that
we're<00:03:55.190> not<00:03:55.870> too<00:03:56.870> high<00:03:57.470> water<00:03:57.800> pressure<00:03:58.040> over<00:03:58.880> a

00:03:58.900 --> 00:03:58.910 
we're not too high water pressure over a

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:01.630 
we're not too high water pressure over a
reading<00:03:59.390> over<00:03:59.450> 70<00:03:59.930> that<00:04:00.170> means<00:04:00.530> you're<00:04:00.680> too

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:01.640 
reading over 70 that means you're too

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:03.460 
reading over 70 that means you're too
high<00:04:01.850> water<00:04:02.120> pressure<00:04:02.360> and<00:04:03.050> you're<00:04:03.290> going<00:04:03.410> to

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:03.470 
high water pressure and you're going to

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:07.270 
high water pressure and you're going to
where<00:04:03.590> I<00:04:03.620> can't<00:04:04.040> go<00:04:04.220> out<00:04:04.280> soon<00:04:05.050> in<00:04:06.050> that<00:04:07.010> case

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280 
where I can't go out soon in that case

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:10.720 
where I can't go out soon in that case
if<00:04:07.580> it<00:04:07.970> if<00:04:08.150> it<00:04:08.300> is<00:04:08.330> higher<00:04:08.600> than<00:04:08.870> that<00:04:09.489> 70<00:04:10.489> and

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:10.730 
if it if it is higher than that 70 and

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:13.690 
if it if it is higher than that 70 and
we'll<00:04:10.880> have<00:04:11.000> to<00:04:11.180> install<00:04:11.660> a<00:04:12.010> water<00:04:13.010> pressure

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:13.700 
we'll have to install a water pressure

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:19.569 
we'll have to install a water pressure
reducing<00:04:14.330> valve<00:04:14.510> and<00:04:15.400> so<00:04:16.480> we'll<00:04:18.370> check<00:04:19.370> and

00:04:19.569 --> 00:04:19.579 
reducing valve and so we'll check and

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:27.130 
reducing valve and so we'll check and
see<00:04:19.730> what<00:04:20.150> it<00:04:20.239> reads<00:04:24.790> read<00:04:25.790> 70<00:04:26.540> so<00:04:26.900> we're<00:04:27.020> going

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:27.140 
see what it reads read 70 so we're going

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:29.969 
see what it reads read 70 so we're going
to<00:04:27.200> need<00:04:27.380> a<00:04:27.440> water<00:04:28.160> pressure<00:04:28.460> reducing<00:04:29.090> though

00:04:29.969 --> 00:04:29.979 
to need a water pressure reducing though

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:33.850 
to need a water pressure reducing though
take<00:04:30.979> our<00:04:31.190> tire<00:04:32.090> gauge<00:04:32.330> and<00:04:33.080> we'll<00:04:33.440> test<00:04:33.710> the

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:33.860 
take our tire gauge and we'll test the

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:36.670 
take our tire gauge and we'll test the
pressure<00:04:34.010> of<00:04:34.280> the<00:04:34.460> safety<00:04:35.390> tank<00:04:35.720> one<00:04:36.410> last

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:36.680 
pressure of the safety tank one last

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:39.940 
pressure of the safety tank one last
time<00:04:36.979> and<00:04:37.940> then<00:04:38.000> well<00:04:38.650> then<00:04:39.650> you<00:04:39.770> should<00:04:39.919> be

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:39.950 
time and then well then you should be

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:42.010 
time and then well then you should be
good<00:04:40.130> to<00:04:40.280> go<00:04:40.310> now<00:04:41.180> I'll<00:04:41.270> just<00:04:41.360> show<00:04:41.600> you<00:04:41.720> a<00:04:41.840> few

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:42.020 
good to go now I'll just show you a few

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:45.040 
good to go now I'll just show you a few
trouble<00:04:42.590> shooting<00:04:43.340> tips<00:04:43.640> in<00:04:44.000> case<00:04:44.180> to<00:04:44.690> tell<00:04:44.900> us

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:45.050 
trouble shooting tips in case to tell us

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:48.190 
trouble shooting tips in case to tell us
your<00:04:45.260> safety<00:04:45.860> tank<00:04:46.550> goes<00:04:46.760> bad<00:04:46.940> or<00:04:46.970> not<00:04:47.780> but

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:48.200 
your safety tank goes bad or not but

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:55.360 
your safety tank goes bad or not but
here<00:04:48.530> we<00:04:48.620> go<00:04:51.610> and<00:04:52.610> look<00:04:53.270> at<00:04:53.419> that<00:04:53.540> about<00:04:53.960> 50<00:04:54.620> psi

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:55.370 
here we go and look at that about 50 psi

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:57.780 
here we go and look at that about 50 psi
so<00:04:56.210> everything<00:04:56.750> checks<00:04:56.990> out<00:04:57.110> pretty<00:04:57.320> good

00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:57.790 
so everything checks out pretty good

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:01.750 
so everything checks out pretty good
that's<00:04:58.790> good<00:04:59.120> news<00:04:59.330> and<00:05:00.250> one<00:05:01.250> last<00:05:01.370> thing<00:05:01.520> to

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:01.760 
that's good news and one last thing to

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:04.300 
that's good news and one last thing to
check<00:05:02.030> if<00:05:02.479> your<00:05:02.660> safety<00:05:03.620> tank<00:05:03.800> ever<00:05:03.950> goes<00:05:04.130> bad

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:04.310 
check if your safety tank ever goes bad

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:08.280 
check if your safety tank ever goes bad
it<00:05:05.090> should<00:05:05.150> sound<00:05:05.650> hard<00:05:06.650> on<00:05:06.800> the<00:05:06.890> clop<00:05:07.100> and

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:08.290 
it should sound hard on the clop and

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:10.690 
it should sound hard on the clop and
hollow<00:05:09.290> on<00:05:09.500> the<00:05:09.620> bottle<00:05:09.890> if<00:05:10.190> you<00:05:10.250> tap<00:05:10.520> on<00:05:10.640> it

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:10.700 
hollow on the bottle if you tap on it

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:13.440 
hollow on the bottle if you tap on it
now<00:05:11.540> if<00:05:11.660> your<00:05:11.810> safety<00:05:12.110> tank<00:05:12.290> goes<00:05:12.440> bad<00:05:12.710> ever

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:13.450 
now if your safety tank goes bad ever

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:20.200 
now if your safety tank goes bad ever
then<00:05:16.150> it'll<00:05:17.150> sound<00:05:17.330> hard<00:05:18.290> on<00:05:18.910> both<00:05:19.910> the<00:05:20.030> top

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:20.210 
then it'll sound hard on both the top

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:25.659 
then it'll sound hard on both the top
and<00:05:20.240> the<00:05:20.450> bottom<00:05:20.600> and<00:05:23.050> every<00:05:24.050> year<00:05:24.430> maybe<00:05:25.430> when
