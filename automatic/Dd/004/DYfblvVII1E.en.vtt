00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400
 hello to all of you guys how's it going and pepper 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.490
 and today in this video I will try to 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:11.820
 explain how you could earn 

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:14.280
 some sps simply runs 24 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.890
 adding a command line in the 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:20.039
 your configuration folder 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:22.350
 battlefield 4 before starting i would 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:25.500
 specify that it does not work for everyone 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:28.320
 depends on your PCs from the processors if 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:31.349
 they are recent or not and if they have four 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:34.620
 six and eight cores yet how they are managed 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:37.440
 so everyone has to do their own 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:40.020
 see how it reacts 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.570
 battlefield with this command line 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.539
 some after reaching this line 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.200
 of the commands have a net increase of s 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.320
 ps 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:52.739
 I'm talking I'm talking sorry about the 10 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:55.649
 at 20 fps is not a small thing 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:58.140
 so all you have to do is enter 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:01.170
 this line of commands to do the 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:04.199
 try if you have more or less fps 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:08.780
 I repeat that I personally tested it 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:10.640
 and also a loss of fps but some 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.920
 because I saw this on an oven 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.630
 some really have really net 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:19.369
 improvement are all happy 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:21.560
 ultra play everyone thanks the 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:23.540
 person who introduced this 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:26.600
 the indie commands saved me now I can 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:30.140
 play 64 players in ultra not 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:32.869
 milanka center on 20 and ps fixed 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:35.229
 thanks thanks thanks then guys do 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:39.229
 this test I risked nothing 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:40.850
 I hope for you if you need it but 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:43.759
 also admitted and asked the plays already 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:45.909
 with 120 fps you have it for sale 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:48.020
 however oh well you do this test 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:50.840
 then first of all 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:55.069
 we look for our fise prosafe profile 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:57.500
 we open it I use edit next to questions 

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:58.940
 the more you can use an alt 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.229
 program that allows me to avoid 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:02.840
 this type of file 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:05.090
 if you have not downloaded them because it is a 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.830
 program that you use times is 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.240
 free 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:13.300
 we open 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:13.300
 we go down to line 51 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:21.010
 so if we go up to line 51 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.080
 arrived here 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:26.800
 make a space in a vineyard 52 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:31.150
 you will stick the line of commands that that 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:34.360
 in the description you make glue and 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:37.810
 save the game did you no longer have 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:41.319
 which test this configuration in 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:43.180
 game will serve more or less then kids 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:46.209
 not see that try this 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:49.090
 manipulation if they work and itself 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:51.700
 just in case it worked and left or 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:54.160
 don't work leave a comment with 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:57.150
 your PC components like this 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:03:01.750
 at least people will see them get an idea 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:03.760

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:04.709
