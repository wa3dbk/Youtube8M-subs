00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:15.640
 Correct Viktor hello good morning here 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:17.779
 We are with this new 4x4 panda and it makes 

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:20.900
 30 years that will be only the first 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:24.410
 generation of panda 4x4 panda 4x4 today 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:27.230
 in day it is the only 4x4 of its segment of 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:32.050
 the little cars the only 4x4 and 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:32.050
 made the cheapest 4x4 on the market 

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:45.950
 our 4x4 panda obviously carries a 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:48.829
 Attraction with a low pair concept 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:50.420
 demand are two differentials with a 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:52.280
 coupling managed by a 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.380
 electronic switchboard that 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:57.170
 automatically without the driver 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:01:01.010
 have to do anything handles according to the 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:04.549
 driving and the type of ground on which 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:07.969
 is the car with a height of more 5 

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:11.180
 centimeters now comes the 4x4 claiming 

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:14.900
 to 15 centimeters thanks to this height 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:17.210
 the angle of attack already at 21 degrees 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:19.310
 which is very good as the angle of 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:22.070
 exit the ventral angle also very 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:25.010
 good since it's a 20 degrees too 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:27.800
 thanks to the design of these bumpers 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:30.710
 you see here also details up to 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:32.600
 aluminum for protection see here 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:34.640
 that the car has a tire as standard 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:37.340
 of alloy but above all tires 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.240
 mixed that for a 4x4 that's very 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.090
 important 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:46.130
 skirts details of these moldings with 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:48.770
 the 4x4 century and also behind some 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:52.970
 protections and sensors 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:54.770
 panda parking is the leader in 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:56.320
 Spanish second best-selling car in 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.490
 Spain now with this new version 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:01.430
 it really opens up a potential because 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:03.860
 not only is it a very comfortable car 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:08.380
 for the road but also for the 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:08.380
 everything I invite you now to try 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:13.519
 in this league 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:22.800
 and let's go for a ride with this panda 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:26.220
 4x4 please do not give the inserts in 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:30.420
 the interior is totally different from the 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:33.840
 saloon let's say with front wheel drive 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:36.630
 there are ecological skin applications the 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:39.870
 car carries the radio as standard 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:41.970
 conditioning also a small button eleÃ© 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.920
 Obviously the car is standard 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.960
 the s &amp; p that when you do everything in control 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:49.770
 of stability but here also for 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:52.290
 this 4x4 car carries a one lock 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:54.210
 Electronic differential for 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:57.270
 block let's say the wheel you have 

00:02:54.210 --> 00:03:00.420
 less motor change to the other 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:02.970
 besides the let's say differential between 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:06.690
 the front axle and the axle reserved this 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:08.400
 button that is used up to 50 kilometers 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:11.970
 per hour also notice that two engines 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:14.130
 are available with this 4x4 panda 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:16.860
 famous twinair motor of the year when he 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:19.950
 launched in 2011 with axles an engine 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:21.959
 turbocharged 85 horsepower and that 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:23.380
 has six speeds and also the 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:28.990
 first short 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:31.200
 really off-road type and a 10 0 75 

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:33.610
 horses are both standard 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:36.930
 start / stop in addition to the equipment 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:36.930
 that I just commented 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:42.870
 novelty of a brake system 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:44.700
 automatic in the 'city break' control 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:48.360
 that it automatically controls is a 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:50.819
 sensor that is placed here and that detects 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:52.739
 to any car that is in front and that 

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:54.270
 Automatically brakes the car in a 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:57.680
 clogging condition to prevent the 

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:57.680
 cars stick 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:06.769
 It is not better 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:10.700
 finally the campaign of this new panda 

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:13.550
 4x4 climbing for ten thousand five hundred 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:16.000
 euros with exceptional financing 

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:18.199
 which also carries four years of warranty 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.410
 four years of my training for 

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:24.380
 play with the concept of 4x4 ten thousand 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:27.530
 500 euros with a swap condition 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:30.830
 in with the engine you binner in with the 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:33.050
 diesel engine for 12 thousand 150 there are also 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:34.850
 another version called trekking that 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:38.000
 it basically carries everything that I just 

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:40.520
 count at the aesthetic level of changes 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.470
 except at the level of traction that obviously 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:45.800
 it's not a 4x4 it 's a front wheel drive 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:48.710
 but with a control system 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:50.330
 transfer the park on the front axle 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:54.110
 this car the trekking also 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:58.100
 available for 8 thousand 700 euros in 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:59.780
 gasoline and by 10 thousand 150 in diesel already 

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:03.100
 I have finished the correct verse I leave you 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:03.100
 thank you and see you next time
