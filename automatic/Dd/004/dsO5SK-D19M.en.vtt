 and I hope you are well 

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:13.490
 today we find ourselves in a 

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:14.360
 new lannin hair tutorial video 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:15.950
 I made you 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:17.480
 it dates from about three weeks ago 

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:19.070
 besides, I will recover justice here 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.539
 you never care what you do 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:22.640
 two hairstyles super simple to achieve 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:24.110
 to go to class at the end of the month for 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:26.150
 every day it's a bit like you 

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:27.619
 want and as a result of this video you 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:29.390
 have many supers and many to 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:31.369
 ask me to redo you 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:33.020
 hairdressing tutorials so that's what I 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:34.640
 do in his video today as 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:36.550
 you could see in the title we get 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.559
 found for four new hairstyles 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:41.930
 based on the dorsal is a technique 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:43.309
 I have used for years and 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:45.860
 are one of my first videos 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:48.649
 it was a video on how to use it 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:50.300
 the backbone in his hairstyles and I'm 

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:52.399
 I'm told it was a very good idea 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:54.320
 finally start doing you again 

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:55.820
 hairstyles with the twist in the 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:58.129
 as far as it's a hyper technique 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.420
 easy to do and that we use in 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:00.829
 several hairstyling techniques 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.079
 different today we are going to especially 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:05.180
 basing on the braids it gives 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:07.220
 madness results and that's really 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.930
 super long but it gives this little trick 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.610
 more at your ease every day 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:12.470
 who is really super told and who does 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:12.770
 the difference and the techniques that I 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:14.869
 you 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:16.880
 facts are really hyper super easy to 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:18.320
 realize then to make these tutorials 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.750
 hairstyle you only need 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.310
 two things of a brush today that 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.479
 a sacred brush seen because it's this 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.569
 who still animates mans but I do in 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:27.530
 this moment and small elastics 

00:01:25.569 --> 00:01:28.969
 transparency I'll have you it's 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.009
 always prettier than using 

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:32.360
 normal elastics and that's it 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:33.829
 you just need then the 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.060
 technique that I approve you in 

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:36.140
 this video then what I you 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.119
 recommend it's still to have the 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.560
 hair a little bit to do 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:41.840
 his hairstyles to the extent that your 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.130
 hair better hang because if 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.719
 you want to wash your hair 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.890
 will really slide too much to the contact 

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:47.149
 other hair and suddenly 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.250
 cars do not lie been many others 

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:51.319
 days like what even to have already 22 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.970
 days of washing to make his hairstyles 

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:54.590
 well listen I think I have you all 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:56.869
 says his hairstyles are to be made for 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.700
 every day of college courses for 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:00.979
 them the jc when you can all the time 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.720
 I hope it's hop here we build with the 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:04.250
 first hairstyle we start everything 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.899
 first with the first hairstyle that 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.549
 is the 4-strand braid so you go 

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:09.799
 to see it is very very simple to realize 

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:11.840
 first of all we start by doing the 

00:02:09.799 --> 00:02:13.069
 twist for that I select the part 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.810
 of my hair which is the longest 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:16.459
 for me it's the middle part in 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.440
 the extent that I have a damn degrade 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:21.019
 so then this part I divide it 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.670
 in two and I turn it into one 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:24.170
 sense so the two strands froze turn 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.480
 in the same sense that here I 'm going to turn 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.100
 to the right and as 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.139
 I rolled them to the right as I 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:31.280
 turn between them from the left like 

00:02:30.139 --> 00:02:31.730
 so you can see it in the sense 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.590
 opposite 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.600
 If I turn to the right and 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:37.280
 I then take them to each other by 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.290
 right it's not going to work and it's going 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.730
 to slip which do not forget to always 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:42.380
 intermingle with each other in the sense 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:47.600
 opposite in which you 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:48.890
 and turn your little locks once 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.750
 that it's over I tie with a 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:52.460
 little transparent elastic and we pass 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.620
 the sad so I say my way 

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:56.360
 hair in three parts and the little 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.400
 twists will play the role of fourth 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:00.230
 part then it's not very complicated 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.250
 take the part of the outside on it 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:05.420
 go underneath 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:06.950
 the second and then the third 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:08.510
 age passes it over then the 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:12.140
 outer part of the right I 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:15.350
 pass over the third then into 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:17.060
 below the little tornado and then 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:18.890
 we start again so I take the 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:22.130
 outer part left I'm going 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:26.770
 pass under the second wick 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:29.120
 and then above the braid me no 

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:33.350
 then the outer part on the right I 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:35.870
 the pass above and then below the 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:36.440
 braid and it's always the same so there 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:38.150
 we start again 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:40.070
 as you can see I start again 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:42.530
 so I'm doing his well above 

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:44.510
 and above below below 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:46.640
 or above over under and I 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:48.380
 do this all the way along and for my 13 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:50.420
 are a bit bigger like you 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:52.340
 can see I'm pulling on the sides and 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:54.170
 Here the braid strands 4 is completed 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:55.880
 it's super hyper pretty and if you 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:57.860
 want more info i made a video 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:00.710
 complete on the a13 to 4 strands to have 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:02.630
 the technique the second hairstyle is 

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:04.250
 the simplest since it is the 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:05.540
 basic 3-core braid 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:07.280
 except that this time have a hard time 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:08.720
 twists so we always have everything to 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:10.100
 time and this time not everything 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:12.040
 simply we have our hair that is in 

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:14.709
 three parties and we will make a truce 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:16.389
 simple alone except that the twist goes 

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:18.009
 play the part of the third part 

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:19.479
 so it's really hyper joly is this 

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:21.130
 that I like in this kind of braiding that 

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:22.750
 instead of a twist you can 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:24.100
 very well put a very targeted or a 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:26.050
 normal braid and it really gives you 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:27.039
 an original hairstyle i have leaves 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:29.050
 I redid as you can see 

00:04:27.039 --> 00:04:30.669
 because it did not satisfy me try 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:31.570
 to highlight the twist and then 

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:33.729
 I attach to it with a rubber band 

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:42.250
 transparent I give a little volume and 

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:44.080
 my hairstyle and finish the third 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:45.639
 hairstyle is just as simple it is 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:47.830
 of a brave chain so in fact it's 

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:49.120
 simply a braid in the form of 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:50.680
 chains as you can see then 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:52.449
 it's even healthier to take 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:55.389
 all our hair we use in two 

00:04:52.449 --> 00:04:57.460
 parts made 2 twists one down 

00:04:55.389 --> 00:04:59.139
 and one on the other side that is attached 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:00.669
 with small elastics transparency 

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:02.199
 how do you have a gradient and you 

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:03.699
 have little hair you can 

00:05:02.199 --> 00:05:05.560
 come and put some hairspray 

00:05:03.699 --> 00:05:06.880
 prevent this effect but unfortunately 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:09.130
 which is degraded is a little bit the 

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:11.259
 risk and once we have our two 

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:13.570
 twist we'll come and weave them between 

00:05:11.259 --> 00:05:15.940
 they then check well do it in 

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:17.440
 common sense always opposed to that 

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:19.599
 you would like to do this usually 

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:20.020
 that will really give that effect to 

00:05:19.599 --> 00:05:21.580
 chain 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:23.860
 as you can see who is hyper 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:26.050
 hyper joly had three dimensions 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:27.639
 super nice then we go to the 

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:29.710
 last hairstyle that is not the most 

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:31.599
 simple but one of the most beautiful 

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:33.280
 find then for that it is very simple 

00:05:31.599 --> 00:05:35.740
 we have our twists and another part 

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:37.270
 hair we pass over it and we 

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:39.220
 selects an outside party to 

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:41.710
 hair that is added to the twist 

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:43.720
 then I pass it underneath and I 

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:45.849
 recommend him the iron over 

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:48.280
 adding a small part of hair 

00:05:45.849 --> 00:05:50.409
 this part is going to actually hold 

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:51.550
 your twists to the rest of your hair 

00:05:50.409 --> 00:05:53.139
 so there as you can see I guard 

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:54.310
 only twist the other part that 

00:05:53.139 --> 00:05:55.690
 I had taken before I the vo but 

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:57.159
 in the interior of the hair and I 

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:58.419
 continues unfortunately I do not have 

00:05:57.159 --> 00:06:00.729
 enough hair length to do 

00:05:58.419 --> 00:06:01.690
 more turns but if you have more than 

00:06:00.729 --> 00:06:04.810
 hair length it may be 

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:06.490
 really really beautiful 

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:07.990
 this video is over I hope 

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:10.210
 that she will not be so anymore 

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:12.580
