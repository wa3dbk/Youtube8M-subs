 fashion designers break into the team 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:03.649
 the change in this breaks the rule now 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.649
 repeat with us every bit 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.700
 then those pages 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:15.369
 roque defendant 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.369
 the woman who no

 tunnel that would be so good afternoon 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:39.340
 but if at other times of the day then 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.720
 who would use the day can actually be 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:47.310
 divided let's say in English in 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:49.690
 four morning option and night periods 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:53.560
 monem night refers to the period that goes 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:54.490
 from midnight to 1159 in the morning and 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.860
 half day 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:02:00.430
 the Aquino 1 would then of course the 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:04.330
 our afternoon from noon to here 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:06.580
 at night six hours 56 hours 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:09.820
 after that we will ban anyone 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:12.459
 that period our someting something 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:15.160
 so and after that in Haiti that the 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:17.319
 Night is already dark, even if it happens 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:19.360
 what for the compliments to say something 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:22.209
 good and graphite there is no difference 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:25.750
 that in fact in the issue of the yen 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:28.269
 with live night is used when you are 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.610
 arriving somewhere does not matter if 

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:32.260
 already dark it is already ten o'clock at night 11 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:34.350
 hours of the night when you arrive at 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.880
 any place you greet with green 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:39.209
 day night you use when you 're going 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.620
 although saying goodbye while sleeping 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:51.810
 have this difference alone 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:51.810
 Let's repeat it now. 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:58.870
 game 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:01.180
 beyond the lengths we have seen 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:03.100
 now that some morning the graffiter did not 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:06.250
 I won none the night 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:08.440
 if you work somewhere that is 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:10.120
 more informal an inn even 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:11.109
 hotel that works with the environment more 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.820
 informal 

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:17.230
 you can simply use the 

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:20.049
 basic greetings ray and hello to 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:22.480
 mean in the very sense of giving 

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:24.370
 A hello to your client then 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:27.010
 something much more informal that you can 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:29.410
 use either at reception or even during 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:31.959
 customer stay you've already won 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:34.190
 a certain trust with him already knows 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:35.990
 so you can use a thunderbolt or reveal 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:39.140
 during his stay to greet 

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:45.610
 the customer now repeat with us the 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:45.610
 greetings ray hello 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:49.730
 something else important to know are also 

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:52.130
 the pronouns of treatment sir lady 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:53.720
 that we would do it in the dialogue that the 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:56.690
 people saw the suspect presented himself as 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:58.240
 Minister break nick mister plans 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:01.670
 in English are as follows 

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:05.510
 mister is used for men alike 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:07.820
 married or single masses is used to 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:10.700
 married women 

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:13.790
 we also have the month that is used for 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:16.040
 single women and the month the 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:17.660
 pronunciation is almost equal to the month of 

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:20.450
 single but he has a little bit of 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:23.120
 sound at the end and is used both 

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:24.320
 for married or single women one 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:26.210
 very important thing in relation to 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:28.280
 treatment programs is that you do not 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:30.890
 can use the pronoun of treatment and the 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:33.170
 person's first name or you use the 

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:36.500
 pronoun for treatment mister and the name 

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:38.690
 the complete treatment plan or 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:41.120
 and the last name because it gives one thing 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:42.669
 formal and it does not make sense to use 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:44.780
 pronoun reported at the beginning and after 

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:46.580
 call the person for the first man 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:48.020
 which is a thing of people that you already 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:49.460
 knows the better start 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:50.870
 So how's the use of this going? 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:53.660
 imagine for example about the name that 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:55.850
 was used in the dialogue either the nic in the case 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:58.430
 the double lord wants to punish man 

00:04:55.850 --> 00:05:02.150
 this workshop nick repeat that mister 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:04.490
 learn here if you want to lose it in 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:12.470
 It was true that I was a married woman. 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:13.580
 I would dare to say hawks and lenny if she 

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:16.430
 I was a woman who I know is 

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:22.460
 single and use helmes breaks the nec 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:24.830
 repeat misskelley and if I did not know 

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:30.250
 Are you a married couple? I'm going to use the month. 

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:30.250
 either because you repeat the month or by neneca 

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:36.319
 when you call a person who 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:38.330
 you do not know her name to you 

00:05:36.319 --> 00:05:40.310
 you need to take care in the use and 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:41.780
 lady because I can not use the month 

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:44.030
 have months 

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:46.580
 the month and a month that we just saw 

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:48.349
 So when will I call a man who 

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:55.430
 I do not know, I want to draw attention. 

00:05:48.349 --> 00:05:59.389
 him I'll call him from being repeat as 

00:05:55.430 --> 00:06:10.159
 It's a woman, I'm going to use it, right? 

00:05:59.389 --> 00:06:12.590
 repeat honey following dialogue and speak 

00:06:10.159 --> 00:06:15.050
 verb harry is a verb that we will 

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:18.139
 see much during the course that he 

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:21.050
 It means having uai 

00:06:18.139 --> 00:06:22.819
 means I do not worry about the 

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:25.819
 other names now that we see in 

00:06:22.819 --> 00:06:27.889
 other videos from our series and the pleasure 

00:06:25.819 --> 00:06:29.210
 seeing box is a very important word 

00:06:27.889 --> 00:06:30.979
 for you working at the hotel because 

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:33.530
 may be the first word that 

00:06:30.979 --> 00:06:34.729
 Guest will tell you what it means 

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:38.300

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:46.550
 receptionist speaks the dialogue reaches 

00:06:43.909 --> 00:06:48.409
 michel brunet the reach would then be 

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:50.300
 equivalent to our welcome a way 

00:06:48.409 --> 00:06:52.460
 of welcome to person and 

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:54.340
 then rally that applies what is the name 

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:56.930
 of the guest 

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:59.150
 now that we have learned how to make 

00:06:56.930 --> 00:07:01.250
 initial reception to our customers 

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:02.409
 we will simulate the dialogue to strengthen the 

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:05.539
 learning 

00:07:02.409 --> 00:07:08.000
 accompanying the text on the screen we will do 

00:07:05.539 --> 00:07:12.169
