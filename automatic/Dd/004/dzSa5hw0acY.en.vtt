 legendary triangle races lured 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:15.599
 numerous motorcycling fans after 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:20.279
 Dieburg's enthusiasm was something you could do 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:21.900
 see and hear she was 15 years old was 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.630

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.590
 become bad but confirm with 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.780
 no matter how cad mark is turned over 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.600
 It was just very interesting one 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.160

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.600
 fascinating the smell the people it 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.250
 is just something completely different 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.690
 it has nothing to do with video and otherwise 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.090
 what to do in nature as 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.489
 smell is strong motorcycle is 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.789

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:57.210

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:05.549
 darmstadt gustav august petermann 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:08.790
 the 97-year-old is thrilled 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:12.950
 Citizens are called up 60 years later 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:16.410
 the legs are so fantastic 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:18.960
 I'm really full of praise 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:22.920
 So I can not say more to that 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:26.160
 admire the people is that at all 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:30.570
 have implemented the idea as I have 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:33.690
 back then only course that was now 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:37.130
 sign other is clearly the 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:39.360
 huge traffic to organize something 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:42.360
 or to get approved 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:45.060
 already art piece that was then 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.490
 Even the police have a simpler way 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.840
 hurray screamed as the first 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:53.640
 motorcycles populate the streets 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:56.850
 by the way, the name dreiecks race comes 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:59.550
 because of course triangles in the 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:03.210

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:04.800
