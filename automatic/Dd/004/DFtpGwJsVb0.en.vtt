whole new line of routers and these are
their<00:00:23.640> new<00:00:23.820> linksys<00:00:24.300> routers<00:00:24.720> this<00:00:24.869> is<00:00:24.990> the

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:25.110 
their new linksys routers this is the

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:29.620 
their new linksys routers this is the
linksys<00:00:26.180> e2000<00:00:27.180> and<00:00:27.329> it<00:00:27.899> is<00:00:28.259> a<00:00:28.500> wireless<00:00:29.040> n

extended<00:00:30.630> range<00:00:31.050> router<00:00:31.710> okay<00:00:32.250> there<00:00:33.030> are<00:00:33.059> a

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
extended range router okay there are a

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.080 
extended range router okay there are a
few<00:00:33.960> in<00:00:34.290> the<00:00:34.530> e<00:00:34.559> series<00:00:35.160> for<00:00:35.520> the<00:00:35.579> new<00:00:35.700> linksys

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
few in the e series for the new linksys

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.540 
few in the e series for the new linksys
this<00:00:36.300> one<00:00:36.450> actually<00:00:36.600> is<00:00:37.050> going<00:00:37.500> to<00:00:37.590> expand<00:00:38.219> the

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
this one actually is going to expand the

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.130 
this one actually is going to expand the
coverage<00:00:38.760> so<00:00:39.059> if<00:00:39.149> you<00:00:39.239> have<00:00:39.329> a<00:00:39.360> larger<00:00:39.809> home<00:00:39.960> or

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
coverage so if you have a larger home or

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.620 
coverage so if you have a larger home or
you<00:00:40.200> want<00:00:40.350> to<00:00:40.410> cover<00:00:40.590> a<00:00:40.710> larger<00:00:41.399> area<00:00:41.430> this<00:00:42.390> is

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:42.630 
you want to cover a larger area this is

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:45.530 
you want to cover a larger area this is
the<00:00:43.200> router<00:00:43.440> for<00:00:44.160> you<00:00:44.460> it<00:00:44.670> also<00:00:44.910> has<00:00:45.510> a

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:45.540 
the router for you it also has a

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:48.920 
the router for you it also has a
built-in<00:00:46.200> gigabit<00:00:47.010> switch<00:00:47.340> so<00:00:47.670> any<00:00:48.000> wired

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
built-in gigabit switch so any wired

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.660 
built-in gigabit switch so any wired
devices<00:00:49.380> you<00:00:49.740> will<00:00:49.770> hook<00:00:50.010> up<00:00:50.190> to<00:00:50.340> this<00:00:50.430> router

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
devices you will hook up to this router

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.050 
devices you will hook up to this router
will<00:00:51.240> work<00:00:51.540> as<00:00:51.690> a<00:00:52.400> gigabit<00:00:53.400> connection<00:00:53.430> so

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:54.060 
will work as a gigabit connection so

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:56.270 
will work as a gigabit connection so
you're<00:00:54.150> gonna<00:00:54.239> get<00:00:54.360> extremely<00:00:55.079> blazing<00:00:55.980> fast

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
you're gonna get extremely blazing fast

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.150 
you're gonna get extremely blazing fast
speeds<00:00:56.610> and<00:00:56.820> it<00:00:57.750> works<00:00:57.960> on<00:00:58.140> two<00:00:58.440> bands<00:00:58.800> what

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
speeds and it works on two bands what

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.530 
speeds and it works on two bands what
that<00:00:59.310> means<00:00:59.489> you<00:01:00.000> got<00:01:00.180> to<00:01:00.210> think<00:01:00.300> of<00:01:00.390> it<00:01:00.450> as

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:00.540 
that means you got to think of it as

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:02.810 
that means you got to think of it as
like<00:01:00.660> a<00:01:00.720> wireless<00:01:01.140> phone<00:01:01.380> it<00:01:01.860> has<00:01:02.160> 2.4

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
like a wireless phone it has 2.4

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.819 
like a wireless phone it has 2.4
gigahertz<00:01:02.880> and<00:01:03.420> 5<00:01:04.019> gigahertz<00:01:04.409> bands

00:01:04.819 --> 00:01:04.829 
gigahertz and 5 gigahertz bands

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:06.800 
gigahertz and 5 gigahertz bands
available<00:01:05.189> to<00:01:05.729> it<00:01:05.850> it<00:01:06.060> will<00:01:06.270> be<00:01:06.360> able<00:01:06.450> to<00:01:06.630> use

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
available to it it will be able to use

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.960 
available to it it will be able to use
either<00:01:07.140> one<00:01:07.500> of<00:01:07.560> those<00:01:07.770> bands<00:01:08.070> depending<00:01:08.970> on

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
either one of those bands depending on

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.060 
either one of those bands depending on
which<00:01:09.360> one<00:01:09.570> has<00:01:09.750> the<00:01:09.780> least<00:01:10.140> interference<00:01:10.920> in

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
which one has the least interference in

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.190 
which one has the least interference in
your<00:01:11.399> home<00:01:11.790> all<00:01:12.060> right<00:01:12.180> and<00:01:12.420> there<00:01:13.049> are<00:01:13.170> a

00:01:17.569 --> 00:01:17.579 
with the 2.4 gigahertz band this one

00:01:17.579 --> 00:01:19.849 
with the 2.4 gigahertz band this one
increases<00:01:17.969> to<00:01:18.210> a<00:01:18.240> higher<00:01:18.539> frequency<00:01:18.859> allowing

increases to a higher frequency allowing

00:01:19.859 --> 00:01:22.370 
increases to a higher frequency allowing
you<00:01:19.979> to<00:01:20.100> have<00:01:20.280> less<00:01:20.999> interference<00:01:21.329> should<00:01:22.049> the
