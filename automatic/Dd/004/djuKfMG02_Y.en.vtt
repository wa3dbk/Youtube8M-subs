so very cool that way we can also

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.780 
so very cool that way we can also
control<00:02:20.840> each<00:02:21.079> one<00:02:21.290> individually<00:02:21.560> so<00:02:22.340> you<00:02:22.370> the

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
control each one individually so you the

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:25.270 
control each one individually so you the
joint<00:02:23.120> or<00:02:23.390> how<00:02:23.599> many<00:02:23.680> pulses<00:02:24.680> you<00:02:24.829> have<00:02:25.069> on

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
there you can take and create them and

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.429 
there you can take and create them and
you<00:02:29.030> know<00:02:29.120> set<00:02:29.450> the<00:02:29.540> mood<00:02:29.689> the<00:02:29.840> way<00:02:29.959> you<00:02:30.019> want

00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:33.019 
maybe you might have one in one part of

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:34.929 
maybe you might have one in one part of
the<00:02:33.109> home<00:02:33.230> and<00:02:33.590> one<00:02:33.950> in<00:02:34.220> different<00:02:34.640> parts<00:02:34.879> of
