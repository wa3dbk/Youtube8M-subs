00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:06.530
 group of a group of people 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:27.489

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:29.680
 because I'm presenting t yes yes to 

00:00:27.489 --> 00:00:32.250
 gallery night tv endure by minutito 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:37.480
 what's up yes yes 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:39.610
 welcome to gallery night tv in this 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:41.500
 moment I have the pride and joy of 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:43.960
 present ricardo if I will tell you who 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:46.150
 is slim jbs artist and cartoonist 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:48.880
 He made a daily circulation every day 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:51.610
 in the nation and also presents with 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:53.850
 kevin johansen the guacamole knows 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:58.470
 let's eat 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.470
 guacamole let's go lynch 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.580
 good what it means to be an artist for me 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:16.100
 s 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:18.250
 that is infinite of most of the 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.250
 players 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:24.710
 I think it's still anchored in a 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:26.630
 chiquitito costadito no childhood 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:29.210
 it seems to me that all the artists in 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:32.240
 some sense they keep playing just like 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:34.610
 how you played when I was a boy then 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.790
 why so much immaturity in the world of 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:36.790
 art 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.219
 so I think it goes that way and 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.659
 on the side of freedom we are going to do 

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:45.170
 fun to play is to play what one 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:47.360
 wants so 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:50.330
 there must be freedom then 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:52.100
 immaturity freedom 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:54.409
 and lie 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:57.140
 because the truth that works of art 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:02:00.500
 they are lies are a novel is a 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:02.240
 lie a movie is a lie and a 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:05.720
 picture is a lie is a place that does not 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:08.720
 it exists generally but within those 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:11.020
 lies in the secret is like putting a 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.210
 true in the middle hidden 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:17.790
 and that is a work of art 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:17.790
 and maturity lie and play 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:29.579
 my first approach to art was good 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:33.400
 like all when young children 

00:02:29.579 --> 00:02:35.319
 first the first thing that d 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.670
 the first moment in a pencils hold 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:38.500
 when he's two or three years old and there 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:41.110
 start I do not know I have a daughter now that 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:45.849
 is at a moment like that the expressionism 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:47.530
 very cute abstract yes and there and then 

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:49.270
 never leave it 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:51.970
 then the first approach very 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:55.030
 natural of that picasso phrase that says 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:03:00.720
 that all children are artists and that 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:00.720
 it's like one starts to see this 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:08.370
 well I think the way I paint 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:12.180
 especially changed the last ones a lot 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:13.980
 times because mostly because I do 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:16.950
 a lot of work with kevin johansen that is 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:19.860
 a young Alaskan musician while 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:21.300
 I love I paint and that made me like 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:22.790
 paint very quickly because in the 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:26.180
 recitals one can not be doubting 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:28.340
 He lost a lot of fear of 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:30.439
 that doubt that one goes with the average brush 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:31.579
 scared to the canvas especially at 

00:03:30.439 --> 00:03:34.120
 principle when they were expensive 

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:35.950
 dressed materials 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:37.810
 and now she lost a little fear and is 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:39.530
 an issue as more playful more than 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:41.810
 game 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:44.780
 and it seems to me that it kind of freed 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:46.490
 a lot the way I paint now 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:49.250
 I think I found that way 

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:51.440
 free it just by putting me 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:53.150
 in a situation like on the edge of a 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:55.819
 precipice that is doing these shows with 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:04:00.180
 kevin and if one does not paint you stay like a 

00:03:55.819 --> 00:04:04.310
 idiot in front of 1000 1200 1500 people 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:04.310
 then you have to paint or paint 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.560
 ah 

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:15.080
 well thank you very much for the visit 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:17.360
 send greetings to friend fernando 

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:20.019
 and pass again when they want we talk 

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:20.019
 more art 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:30.940
 thank you very much line for the note and to 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:36.300

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:36.300
 more you win forever 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:54.770
 obvious group 

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:54.770
 a group of people
