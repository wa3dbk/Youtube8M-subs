definition<00:01:54.329> was<00:01:54.630> like<00:01:54.810> on<00:01:55.020> point<00:01:55.409> like<00:01:56.219> I<00:01:56.310> said

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
definition was like on point like I said

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.130 
definition was like on point like I said
my<00:01:56.610> hair<00:01:56.790> is<00:01:56.909> prone<00:01:57.149> to<00:01:57.180> phrase<00:01:57.509> so<00:01:57.719> that<00:01:57.750> top

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
my hair is prone to phrase so that top

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.719 
my hair is prone to phrase so that top
layer<00:01:58.350> always<00:01:58.890> gets<00:01:59.189> a<00:01:59.280> little<00:01:59.430> crazy

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
layer always gets a little crazy

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.520 
layer always gets a little crazy
probably<00:02:00.329> could<00:02:00.719> have<00:02:00.810> been<00:02:01.110> a<00:02:01.140> little<00:02:01.320> bit

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
probably could have been a little bit

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.190 
probably could have been a little bit
more<00:02:01.560> heavy-handed<00:02:02.130> on<00:02:02.430> the<00:02:02.549> top<00:02:02.990> but<00:02:03.990> next

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
more heavy-handed on the top but next

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.190 
more heavy-handed on the top but next
time<00:02:04.530> I<00:02:04.770> know
