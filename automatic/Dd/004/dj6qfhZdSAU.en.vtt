00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.440 
today you will first operate with Jack
pain<00:00:04.680> is<00:00:04.830> that<00:00:04.920> a<00:00:04.980> son<00:00:05.250> depends<00:00:05.520> upon<00:00:05.670> law<00:00:06.000> yeah

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:06.450 
pain is that a son depends upon law yeah

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:08.270 
pain is that a son depends upon law yeah
no<00:00:06.720> Jack<00:00:07.080> will<00:00:07.230> be<00:00:07.319> the<00:00:07.410> captain<00:00:07.770> I've<00:00:08.040> made<00:00:08.250> a

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
no Jack will be the captain I've made a

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.640 
no Jack will be the captain I've made a
decision<00:00:08.580> on<00:00:08.820> that<00:00:08.880> he'll<00:00:09.719> be<00:00:09.870> captain<00:00:10.260> of<00:00:10.500> the

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
decision on that he'll be captain of the

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.870 
decision on that he'll be captain of the
club<00:00:11.030> I<00:00:12.030> think<00:00:12.690> he's<00:00:13.019> right<00:00:13.200> to<00:00:13.259> do<00:00:13.860> it<00:00:13.980> now<00:00:14.130> it

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
club I think he's right to do it now it

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.840 
club I think he's right to do it now it
was<00:00:15.000> one<00:00:15.150> or<00:00:15.179> two<00:00:15.299> obvious<00:00:16.670> alternatives<00:00:17.670> to

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
was one or two obvious alternatives to

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.760 
was one or two obvious alternatives to
that<00:00:17.880> it's<00:00:18.630> north<00:00:18.840> but<00:00:19.050> that<00:00:19.199> dilemma<00:00:19.439> isn't

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
that it's north but that dilemma isn't

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.380 
that it's north but that dilemma isn't
it<00:00:19.830> yeah<00:00:20.070> it<00:00:20.189> is<00:00:20.310> but<00:00:20.699> I<00:00:20.789> think<00:00:20.820> Jack's<00:00:21.210> been

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
it yeah it is but I think Jack's been

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.630 
it yeah it is but I think Jack's been
captain<00:00:21.689> before<00:00:21.930> he<00:00:22.050> was<00:00:22.199> only<00:00:22.380> until<00:00:22.640> he's

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
captain before he was only until he's

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:24.920 
captain before he was only until he's
gonna<00:00:23.760> be<00:00:23.880> a<00:00:23.910> key<00:00:24.060> member<00:00:24.210> of<00:00:24.359> our<00:00:24.480> team<00:00:24.720> next

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
gonna be a key member of our team next

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.929 
gonna be a key member of our team next
year<00:00:25.080> and<00:00:25.320> I<00:00:25.350> think<00:00:25.560> the<00:00:26.279> way<00:00:26.430> he's<00:00:26.550> come<00:00:26.730> back

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
year and I think the way he's come back

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.880 
year and I think the way he's come back
and<00:00:27.810> the<00:00:27.900> way<00:00:28.019> he's<00:00:28.170> been<00:00:28.410> around<00:00:28.769> the

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
and the way he's been around the

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:29.990 
and the way he's been around the
training<00:00:29.160> ground<00:00:29.429> in<00:00:29.550> terms<00:00:29.699> of<00:00:29.910> the

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
training ground in terms of the

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.220 
training ground in terms of the
encouragement<00:00:30.420> and<00:00:30.599> things<00:00:30.810> he's<00:00:30.960> given<00:00:31.080> the

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
encouragement and things he's given the

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.229 
encouragement and things he's given the
young<00:00:31.439> players<00:00:31.740> I<00:00:31.830> think<00:00:32.090> it's<00:00:33.090> really

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
young players I think it's really

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:34.430 
young players I think it's really
important<00:00:33.660> it's<00:00:33.780> an<00:00:33.840> important<00:00:34.230> role<00:00:34.350> of

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
important it's an important role of

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.549 
important it's an important role of
captains<00:00:34.829> are<00:00:34.950> all<00:00:35.010> you<00:00:35.160> know<00:00:35.250> and<00:00:36.469> being<00:00:37.469> a

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
captains are all you know and being a

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.110

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
captain brings all different things but

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.729 
captain brings all different things but
the<00:00:39.239> first<00:00:39.600> and<00:00:39.780> foremost<00:00:40.200> this<00:00:40.350> is<00:00:40.469> going<00:00:40.680> to

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
the first and foremost this is going to

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.580 
the first and foremost this is going to
make<00:00:40.829> sure<00:00:41.010> he<00:00:41.129> maintains<00:00:41.520> his<00:00:41.700> form<00:00:42.260> and<00:00:43.260> make

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
sure he stays on the team and then he's

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.380 
sure he stays on the team and then he's
already<00:00:47.129> got<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:47.460> respect<00:00:47.730> of<00:00:47.910> his<00:00:47.969> teammates

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
because some people don't like the

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.109
