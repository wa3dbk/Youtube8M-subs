00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.609 
risky but I'm going to show you how to
do<00:00:18.449> it<00:00:18.570> and<00:00:18.690> I'm<00:00:18.840> first<00:00:19.080> going<00:00:19.140> to<00:00:19.289> show<00:00:19.350> off

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
do it and I'm first going to show off

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.250 
do it and I'm first going to show off
what<00:00:20.250> it<00:00:20.430> is<00:00:20.609> it's<00:00:20.880> basically<00:00:21.260> multitasking

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
what it is it's basically multitasking

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.740 
what it is it's basically multitasking
for<00:00:22.529> the<00:00:22.619> ad<00:00:22.740> pad<00:00:23.039> a<00:00:23.070> lot<00:00:23.369> like<00:00:23.519> circuit<00:00:23.970> is<00:00:24.090> but

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
for the ad pad a lot like circuit is but

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.560 
for the ad pad a lot like circuit is but
with<00:00:25.019> a<00:00:25.050> different<00:00:25.500> spin<00:00:25.710> to<00:00:25.949> it<00:00:25.980> it's<00:00:26.340> so<00:00:27.300> far

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
with a different spin to it it's so far

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:28.730 
with a different spin to it it's so far
I've<00:00:27.689> only<00:00:27.810> tried<00:00:28.080> it<00:00:28.170> for<00:00:28.349> a<00:00:28.410> few<00:00:28.529> minutes

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
I've only tried it for a few minutes

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.040 
I've only tried it for a few minutes
looks<00:00:29.580> great<00:00:29.820> it's<00:00:30.240> a<00:00:30.390> lot<00:00:30.539> like<00:00:30.689> the<00:00:30.810> other

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
looks great it's a lot like the other

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.490 
looks great it's a lot like the other
pro<00:00:31.320> switcher<00:00:31.759> fluent<00:00:32.759> and<00:00:33.170> but<00:00:34.170> it's<00:00:34.290> still

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
pro switcher fluent and but it's still

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.350 
pro switcher fluent and but it's still
an<00:00:34.739> alpha<00:00:35.070> so<00:00:35.250> it<00:00:35.340> could<00:00:35.489> crash<00:00:35.790> a<00:00:35.820> lot<00:00:36.239> of

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
an alpha so it could crash a lot of

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.889 
an alpha so it could crash a lot of
things<00:00:36.540> so<00:00:37.410> if<00:00:37.800> you're<00:00:38.010> really<00:00:38.489> hesitant<00:00:39.300> you

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
things so if you're really hesitant you

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.380 
things so if you're really hesitant you
could<00:00:40.110> wait<00:00:40.290> for<00:00:40.620> the<00:00:40.770> for<00:00:41.579> the<00:00:41.610> legit<00:00:42.239> version

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
could wait for the for the legit version

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.779 
could wait for the for the legit version
to<00:00:42.600> come<00:00:42.750> off<00:00:42.899> so<00:00:43.230> you<00:00:43.710> can<00:00:43.860> see<00:00:44.100> my<00:00:44.190> iPad<00:00:44.610> and

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
to come off so you can see my iPad and

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.360 
to come off so you can see my iPad and
this<00:00:45.450> works<00:00:45.750> with<00:00:45.899> back<00:00:46.110> rounded<00:00:46.500> apps<00:00:46.710> so

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
this works with back rounded apps so

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.610 
this works with back rounded apps so
what<00:00:47.489> I'm<00:00:47.579> going<00:00:47.670> to<00:00:47.730> do<00:00:47.879> is<00:00:48.090> say<00:00:48.660> just<00:00:49.260> go<00:00:49.410> into

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
what I'm going to do is say just go into

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.110 
what I'm going to do is say just go into
a<00:00:49.680> pit<00:00:49.950> vice<00:00:50.129> app<00:00:51.710> when<00:00:52.710> you<00:00:52.920> go<00:00:53.250> out<00:00:53.430> it<00:00:53.760> when

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
a pit vice app when you go out it when

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.790 
a pit vice app when you go out it when
you<00:00:54.210> background<00:00:54.629> it<00:00:54.780> it<00:00:54.899> stays<00:00:55.140> here<00:00:55.500> and<00:00:55.680> you

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
you background it it stays here and you

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.660 
you background it it stays here and you
can<00:00:55.890> see<00:00:56.070> it<00:00:56.129> in<00:00:56.420> here<00:00:57.420> you<00:00:57.570> can<00:00:57.750> flick<00:00:58.440> up<00:00:58.670> to

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
can see it in here you can flick up to

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.170 
can see it in here you can flick up to
get<00:00:59.850> rid<00:01:00.059> of<00:01:00.180> the<00:01:00.480> task<00:01:00.780> it's<00:01:01.550> basically<00:01:02.550> it

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
get rid of the task it's basically it

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.329 
get rid of the task it's basically it
works<00:01:03.420> with<00:01:03.750> background<00:01:04.320> ER<00:01:04.500> if<00:01:05.040> you<00:01:05.159> have

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
works with background ER if you have

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.130 
works with background ER if you have
that<00:01:05.580> you<00:01:05.790> need<00:01:05.939> you<00:01:06.210> need<00:01:06.360> that<00:01:06.570> just<00:01:06.840> look<00:01:06.990> up

app advice are you hit home and then
let's<00:01:19.380> say<00:01:19.710> I<00:01:20.070> go<00:01:20.430> into<00:01:23.030> foosball<00:01:24.320> background

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
let's say I go into foosball background

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:31.149 
let's say I go into foosball background
that<00:01:26.750> and<00:01:28.310> you<00:01:29.310> can<00:01:29.490> see<00:01:29.670> you<00:01:29.820> can<00:01:29.850> hear<00:01:30.270> it<00:01:30.360> and
