00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.180
 i am aaron from the micro hearty 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.430
 welcome the computex 2014 and me 

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:13.490
 may you housing the very first today 

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:15.380
 from be quiet imagine 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:17.330
 the motto of the development of the 

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:19.910
 housing was basically the the form 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:21.289
 the function follows standard from everything 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:22.580
 on a power point presentation 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:23.750
 that was what it was in every workshop 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:25.040
 basically only at the beginning 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:26.650
 that was really the discussion 

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:28.789
 function stands in the foreground 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:30.470
 I would also like this shortly 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:31.580
 show and explain on the basis of 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:33.320
 features and features we 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:36.320
 actually installed around the housing 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:39.140
 we'll catch the frontpanel best 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:42.589
 I can open it here and behind it 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:44.930
 are already two piercings in 140 mm 

00:00:42.589 --> 00:00:45.920
 pre-installed suck the air in the 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:47.420
 housing in 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.280
 but the front is applied to the material 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.750
 that means I have no sound waves 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.269
 getting outside to the customer 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:54.890
 Now you can see these air intakes 

00:00:53.269 --> 00:00:56.570
 Here, for example, will only be in design 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:58.100
 But they are not 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:01.129
 the air is inveigled here side 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:03.199
 and before the dust guard and then 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:04.670
 in the housing pure feeling here in the 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:06.560
 pages are through these holes that is 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.720
 it comes in here is set before and 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.490
 then one is something like that 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.409
 We on the back of the case 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:14.570
 I made the housing for it 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:16.430
 in short, we also want to get into that 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:18.469
 Housing purely from below from the 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:20.179
 Caseback has the mouth for it was 

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:22.159
 attached to the back that is if 

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:24.049
 Fans are in there or from power supplies 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:25.399
 fan works brilliantly when we go to 

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:26.810
 front to the user but if after 

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:29.119
 led back and do not come by 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.960
 Nearby or can the noise 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:32.929
 bring it outside 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.549
 Of course, that's about it, too 

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:36.679
 Dust cover installed contactor 

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:38.240
 hardware with all the hardware too 

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:40.999
 nice clean if you stay with us 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:43.729
 should we have the above installed 

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:45.619
 possibility of two 120 mm fans too 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:48.770
 install or for a water cooling 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:50.539
 and 240 mm radiator for it's up too 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.979
 Once again, this air opening is not 

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:54.200
 just in the housing purely confessed but 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:55.460
 later you will see that again 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.139
 down around again with one 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:58.549
 Transom provided so that sound waves 

00:01:57.139 --> 00:02:04.009
 be broken again and not up 

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:06.020
 directly out of the case can 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:07.789
 So the page go away yet 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:11.030
 Of course we have insulated as well 

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:12.620
 Another use of air if you have that 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.940
 Case reordered closed 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:16.130
 basically if you say over now 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.200
 okay i have two other graphic artists or 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:19.970
 a very high performance graphics card i 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.310
 need more air you can do this 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.750
 understand and open short ones of them 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.860
 then air can be drawn in normally 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.420
 but I can also do one 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:26.970
 Install the fan behind the fan 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.590
 dust protection 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:31.080
 You can actively air in the housing 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.460
 the housing cover carries the pages 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.980
 blanket look the same on both sides 

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:35.910
 why I come to shows later 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.190
 inside of the housing 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:40.020
 Today we have two hard disk cages 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:41.550
 not surprised here 1 degree taken out 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:42.120
 so that the graphics card mounted 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:44.160
 can be 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.960
 Here you can already see how the hard drive 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.430
 the hard drive is mounted with 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:48.900
 a complete gumming mounted around 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.970
 this and couple and no vibrations 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:53.100
 whether to transfer the housing we 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:55.380
 but basically recommend ssds if 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:57.840
 it will be a complete its system 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:59.550
 We also have gumming 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:02.570
 I said yes to our fans in the front 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:06.630
 There are two 140 mm fans installed 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:08.459
 back 120 mm fan and these as 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:10.170
 already decoupled you can see in this 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:11.610
 Space black rubber sheath 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.920
 between the vss would be no 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:15.090
 vibrations transmitted from the housing 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.010
 power supply exactly the same 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:18.690
 users who are not in dark power 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:21.720
 pro of us take where this decoupling 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:23.880
 already on the power supply are on the size 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:25.200
 bottom and front to rear also 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:27.230
 my head on it means everyone 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:30.390
 other websites on the tops 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:31.590
 we just had the cage 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:32.400
 addressed disk cage the 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.930
 have removed 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.400
 you can remove the cage so you can 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:37.590
 The graphics card scenes can be the special 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:40.170
 have a total length after that are long 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:43.470
 of 400 millimeters are available 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:43.920
 since we ourselves very large cpu-cooler be 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:45.269
 quiet 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.860
 but, of course, made sure that the 

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:48.570
 fit in here as well and larger ones 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:50.430
 that means with the size you have the 

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:53.239
 possibility to install cooler in 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:57.480
 installation depth of up to 17 cm 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:59.910
 I said earlier that both 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:01.200
 side blankets are designed with the same 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:02.790
 the possibilities to stage fans 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.700
 and wanted to show why on the 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:08.430
 On the other hand, that's the way you can treat me 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:09.900
 on the back, install ssds two 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:11.730
 piece so you can second 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:13.590
 install hard drive cage 2 on the 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:15.600
 back so up to four pieces and can 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:16.890
 They also actively cool what you do 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:19.290
 Here we see very well that we everywhere 

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:20.700
 You can have these cable glands 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:22.350
 the whole cable material to the rear 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:24.770
 create a good air circulation 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:27.750
 to provide nice tidy system 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:29.220
 otherwise typical standard things front 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:32.250
 panels accessible directly above 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:33.810
 the front lay the door can be changed 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:34.979
 that is, if you want to say that 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:35.729
 You can issue that on the other side 

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:38.099
 turn whole 

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:39.090
 we have implementation 

00:04:38.099 --> 00:04:39.930
 Cable glands on the back 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:42.180
 from the housing 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:44.280
 for external water cooling et cetera but 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:46.889
 otherwise it is important as I said that 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:48.060
 the form of the function follows and i 

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:50.850
 I think we have to do that very well 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:53.729
 Air flow explains the housing will be 

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:56.639
 be available from october in three 

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:57.930
 color variations this orange once with 

00:04:56.639 --> 00:05:00.479
 silver applications once a 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:03.169
 completely black and for the price of 119 

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:03.169
 99
