if any people have done it but like um I
go<00:01:24.640> like<00:01:24.790> that<00:01:26.070> because<00:01:27.070> sometimes<00:01:27.640> the<00:01:27.850> track

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:28.090 
go like that because sometimes the track

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:30.060 
go like that because sometimes the track
won't<00:01:28.360> go<00:01:28.630> if<00:01:29.080> you're<00:01:29.260> just<00:01:29.410> going<00:01:29.650> like<00:01:29.770> that

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:30.070 
won't go if you're just going like that

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:36.630 
won't go if you're just going like that
plus<00:01:30.850> you<00:01:31.000> have<00:01:31.150> it<00:01:31.240> really<00:01:31.480> loose<00:01:35.430> and<00:01:36.430> then

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:36.640 
plus you have it really loose and then

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.690 
plus you have it really loose and then
so<00:01:37.090> it<00:01:37.900> comes<00:01:38.110> with<00:01:38.350> to<00:01:38.530> flick<00:01:38.800> fire<00:01:39.040> on<00:01:39.370> each

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:39.700 
so it comes with to flick fire on each

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:45.540 
so it comes with to flick fire on each
side<00:01:41.580> go<00:01:42.580> pretty<00:01:42.970> far<00:01:43.290> but<00:01:44.290> follow<00:01:45.220> that<00:01:45.370> one

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:45.550 
side go pretty far but follow that one

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:55.609
