 olives that last three to four months 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:02.309
 we are the children of the olive tree 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.309
 all there 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:13.030
 must she repeat I had galgos 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:14.740
 since this little child I saw 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:15.550
 the galgos this on farms canton 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.340
 pick up the olives 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:21.210
 indeed after the war people 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:21.210
 were poor poor 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.120
 at the time the only meat that the 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:30.910
 workers and the peasants we are 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:32.710
 had come from the purchase for the survival of 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:34.130
 hare is intimately linked to existence 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:36.829
 of the olive tree 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:38.990
 chased by hunting dogs the 

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:40.210
 hare are safe in the 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.500
 hollow of the three centenarians 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:44.030
 this is how an Andalusian hare goes

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:49.270
 near the end of his race he will find
