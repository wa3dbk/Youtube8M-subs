biggest<00:02:46.239> you<00:02:46.510> can<00:02:46.630> find<00:02:47.400> 18<00:02:48.400> volts<00:02:48.760> as<00:02:48.880> the<00:02:49.000> big

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
biggest you can find 18 volts as the big

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:50.910 
biggest you can find 18 volts as the big
as<00:02:49.299> they<00:02:49.450> have<00:02:49.660> because<00:02:50.380> if<00:02:50.530> you<00:02:50.650> get<00:02:50.769> a<00:02:50.799> small

you know a few things can happen to it
so<00:03:01.000> just<00:03:01.420> get<00:03:01.569> a<00:03:01.599> big<00:03:01.810> one<00:03:02.400> the<00:03:03.400> button<00:03:03.760> that<00:03:03.940> I

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
so just get a big one the button that I

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.819 
so just get a big one the button that I
put<00:03:04.209> over<00:03:04.390> here<00:03:04.660> sometimes<00:03:05.110> it<00:03:05.380> doesn't<00:03:05.680> stay

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:05.829 
put over here sometimes it doesn't stay

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:08.099 
put over here sometimes it doesn't stay
in<00:03:05.860> place<00:03:06.220> you<00:03:06.730> know<00:03:06.880> sometimes<00:03:07.600> it<00:03:07.930> doesn't

in place you know sometimes it doesn't

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:10.699 
in place you know sometimes it doesn't
spin<00:03:08.500> so<00:03:09.160> what<00:03:09.310> you<00:03:09.400> can<00:03:09.609> do<00:03:09.790> is<00:03:09.940> put<00:03:10.180> a<00:03:10.209> drop<00:03:10.540> of

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
spin so what you can do is put a drop of

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:15.750 
spin so what you can do is put a drop of
crazy<00:03:12.209> superglue<00:03:13.209> I<00:03:13.359> mean<00:03:14.400> over<00:03:15.400> here<00:03:15.579> so
