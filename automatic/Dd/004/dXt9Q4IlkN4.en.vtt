00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:04.370
 josé manuel good evening we are in 

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:07.250
 vigo for the last word of fox 

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:09.889
 Sports Rubén Rodríguez reprobable or I 

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:11.839
 how would you take back like as you 

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:14.059
 dismissed the Mexican fans and the 

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:16.730
 second that happens to the selection 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:18.830
 Mexican who does not find his football and his 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:21.320
 good operation thanks 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:24.619
 good the things that adjectives that they 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:26.720
 I put these , you leave them 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:30.140
 of course it is what is observed what 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:35.110
 we see and analyze we have made a 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:35.110
 good football despite having some 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.899
 in ball position to have some 

00:00:37.949 --> 00:00:42.539
 options but it's not football that 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.550
 we are used to seeing in our 

00:00:42.539 --> 00:00:48.930
 selection 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:51.239
 and well very imprecise fifth is two 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.879
 in the rhythm of that intensity in that 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.440
 speed to be able to have more 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.739
 depth of having more and better 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.739
 Arrivals 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:03.640
 what reflection do you draw from this debut of the 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:05.860
 Mexican selection mostly because 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:09.460
 hardens the position of the people the day 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:11.070
 today unfortunately against you 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.830
 well that 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.460
 we know that he does it so alone 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:19.200
 we need of course to improve a lot 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:21.330
 be much more intense be much more 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:25.140
 precise so that the results are 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:28.170
 can give then in this are they look 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.090
 we are aware and good what is 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.710
 mention and what you mention in two 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.720
 tweeters sometimes is the feeling of 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.640
 people 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.920
 you want to see well represented with 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:39.050
 selection and that with the successes have 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.750
 added partners 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:43.130
 this week 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:46.520
 and especially the parts 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:50.000
 rus well that is something we have to be 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.780
 very attentive and be working on top of 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.909
 they 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:55.310
 we know the circumstances are like this 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:57.439
 the breaks for a short time but 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.909
 good is part of what the challenges that 

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:01.250
 we have taken and that the same player 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:03.150
 is conscious and that is forcing by 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.130
 be the best possible 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:07.470
 in this aspect in the result we do not 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:11.250
 has accompanied in fact we take the 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:12.750
 dressing goals then that talks about 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.180
 that it enters the same 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.580
 concentration we are out still 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.319
 so in that we have to be very 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:22.230
 clear and mobile 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:24.659
 and analytical and take the job the best 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:27.470
 possible because they are looking for two matches to 

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:31.040
 can do it to be able to 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:32.780
 and arrive in a better way to look for 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:37.030
 the next round and look for the best 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:37.030
 possible level for the objective 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.180
 in view of the circumstances the 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:43.520
 question is very direct waiting for a 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:45.560
 very direct answer is staying 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:48.040
 big in the coach position of the 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.040
 Mexican team 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:58.830
 a very rich director asks me 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:00.720
 because the main objective is 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:02.910
 qualify the world of course 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.340
 we have this objective also to search 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:07.950
 achieve 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.760
 endorsed the title of the cup or that 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.650
 we also have it 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.350
 montse other goals that some do not 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:14.330
 they have taken two more 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:15.760
 what I principal rating and if 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:18.170
 I finish now we are qualified 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:20.810
 then they are circumstances that we 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:22.160
 they pass not all can be good any 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:25.580
 team in the world has them all 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:27.470
 good real madrid-barcelona of all 

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:29.390
 teams go through ups and downs 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:31.580
 we are in a low and we have to 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:33.320
 endure having working and forcing 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:35.770
 machine to reverse the circumstances 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:35.770
 and it's over
