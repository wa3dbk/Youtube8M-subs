00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
throw a grenade here because it doesn't

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.349 
throw a grenade here because it doesn't
matter<00:00:28.529> if<00:00:28.650> it<00:00:28.800> kills<00:00:29.010> anyone<00:00:29.189> or<00:00:29.369> not<00:00:29.519> it'll

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
matter if it kills anyone or not it'll

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:31.640 
matter if it kills anyone or not it'll
still<00:00:30.539> discourage<00:00:30.900> anyone<00:00:31.109> from<00:00:31.230> running<00:00:31.590> in

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
still discourage anyone from running in

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:32.930 
still discourage anyone from running in
that<00:00:31.800> room<00:00:31.980> and<00:00:32.099> they<00:00:32.160> see<00:00:32.219> the<00:00:32.369> explosion

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
that room and they see the explosion

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.959 
that room and they see the explosion
lots<00:00:33.239> of<00:00:33.360> times<00:00:33.540> we'll<00:00:33.690> just<00:00:33.840> stop<00:00:34.050> and<00:00:34.230> wait

00:00:34.959 --> 00:00:34.969 
lots of times we'll just stop and wait

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:36.950 
lots of times we'll just stop and wait
so<00:00:35.969> I<00:00:36.000> don't<00:00:36.239> need<00:00:36.329> to<00:00:36.390> just<00:00:36.630> dump<00:00:36.780> all<00:00:36.899> my

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
so I don't need to just dump all my

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.840 
so I don't need to just dump all my
group<00:00:37.230> all<00:00:37.410> my<00:00:37.530> grenades<00:00:37.829> back<00:00:38.010> there<00:00:38.219> it'll

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
group all my grenades back there it'll

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.880 
group all my grenades back there it'll
just<00:00:38.879> waste<00:00:39.149> my<00:00:39.270> time<00:00:39.450> and<00:00:39.600> saw<00:00:39.690> me<00:00:39.809> down<00:00:39.960> so

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
just waste my time and saw me down so

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.040 
just waste my time and saw me down so
since<00:00:41.160> I<00:00:41.250> threw<00:00:41.430> one<00:00:42.149> back<00:00:42.450> there<00:00:42.660> I<00:00:42.719> know<00:00:42.840> it's

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
since I threw one back there I know it's

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.560 
since I threw one back there I know it's
impossible<00:00:43.379> for<00:00:43.739> anyone<00:00:44.040> to<00:00:44.129> be<00:00:44.239> back<00:00:45.239> waiting

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
impossible for anyone to be back waiting

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.440 
impossible for anyone to be back waiting
for<00:00:45.690> me<00:00:45.930> so<00:00:46.559> it's<00:00:46.980> safe<00:00:47.250> to<00:00:47.460> then<00:00:47.879> just<00:00:48.120> sprint

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
for me so it's safe to then just sprint

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.529 
for me so it's safe to then just sprint
through<00:00:48.660> here<00:00:48.899> and<00:00:49.890> almost<00:00:50.579> every<00:00:50.910> time<00:00:51.120> I'll

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
through here and almost every time I'll

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.080 
through here and almost every time I'll
find<00:00:52.170> people<00:00:52.500> back<00:00:52.739> in<00:00:52.890> this<00:00:52.949> area<00:00:53.129> especially

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
find people back in this area especially

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.350 
find people back in this area especially
the<00:00:54.420> small<00:00:54.629> room<00:00:54.719> in<00:00:54.809> the<00:00:54.899> back<00:00:55.640> so<00:00:56.640> then<00:00:57.329> i

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
the small room in the back so then i

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.939 
the small room in the back so then i
watch<00:00:57.600> for<00:00:57.809> claymores<00:00:58.320> and<00:00:58.620> head<00:00:58.800> to<00:00:58.920> the

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
watch for claymores and head to the

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.330 
watch for claymores and head to the
spawn<00:00:59.250> point

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:01.340 
spawn point

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:05.570 
spawn point
you<00:01:02.340> a<00:01:02.370> here<00:01:02.760> we<00:01:02.880> go<00:01:03.090> and<00:01:03.510> pause<00:01:03.840> again<00:01:04.580> watch

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
you a here we go and pause again watch

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.640 
you a here we go and pause again watch
this<00:01:05.790> last<00:01:05.940> guy<00:01:06.210> notice<00:01:06.720> how<00:01:06.870> after<00:01:07.170> I<00:01:07.350> hit<00:01:07.560> him

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
this last guy notice how after I hit him

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.340 
this last guy notice how after I hit him
once<00:01:07.860> he<00:01:08.070> kind<00:01:08.250> of<00:01:08.310> disappears<00:01:08.840> but<00:01:09.840> I<00:01:10.080> can

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
once he kind of disappears but I can

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:11.930 
once he kind of disappears but I can
still<00:01:10.680> see<00:01:11.100> his<00:01:11.220> name<00:01:11.340> floating<00:01:11.670> above<00:01:11.820> his

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:11.940 
still see his name floating above his

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:13.880 
still see his name floating above his
head<00:01:12.060> and<00:01:12.330> I<00:01:12.450> know<00:01:12.510> exactly<00:01:12.750> where<00:01:13.170> he<00:01:13.290> is<00:01:13.320> you

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
head and I know exactly where he is you

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.280 
head and I know exactly where he is you
can<00:01:14.010> shoot<00:01:14.220> through<00:01:14.460> almost<00:01:15.210> any<00:01:15.540> wall<00:01:15.780> so

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
can shoot through almost any wall so

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.540 
can shoot through almost any wall so
that's<00:01:16.860> a<00:01:16.920> good<00:01:17.070> trick<00:01:18.560> and<00:01:19.560> you<00:01:20.370> might<00:01:20.520> be

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:20.550 
that's a good trick and you might be

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:22.070 
that's a good trick and you might be
wondering<00:01:20.790> why<00:01:21.060> I'm<00:01:21.150> using<00:01:21.300> a<00:01:21.479> silencer<00:01:21.660> in<00:01:21.990> a

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
wondering why I'm using a silencer in a

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.690 
wondering why I'm using a silencer in a
hardcore<00:01:22.260> mode<00:01:22.560> because<00:01:22.830> there's<00:01:23.370> no<00:01:23.490> radar

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
hardcore mode because there's no radar

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.270 
hardcore mode because there's no radar
anyways<00:01:24.150> well<00:01:25.050> iron<00:01:25.410> sights<00:01:25.770> really<00:01:26.010> don't

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
anyways well iron sights really don't

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.760 
anyways well iron sights really don't
bother<00:01:26.400> me<00:01:26.670> and<00:01:27.020> I'll<00:01:28.020> pause<00:01:28.290> it<00:01:28.440> here<00:01:28.560> again

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
bother me and I'll pause it here again

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.450 
bother me and I'll pause it here again
the<00:01:29.400> way<00:01:29.580> I<00:01:29.910> see<00:01:30.420> it<00:01:30.660> is<00:01:30.930> a<00:01:31.229> red<00:01:32.070> dot<00:01:32.220> sight

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
the way I see it is a red dot sight

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.700 
the way I see it is a red dot sight
doesn't<00:01:32.820> affect<00:01:33.330> anything<00:01:33.600> sat<00:01:33.990> why's<00:01:34.140> it

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
doesn't affect anything sat why's it

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.109 
doesn't affect anything sat why's it
only<00:01:34.860> helps<00:01:35.040> you<00:01:35.250> if<00:01:35.490> you<00:01:35.610> have<00:01:35.729> trouble<00:01:35.940> with

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
only helps you if you have trouble with

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.810 
only helps you if you have trouble with
iron<00:01:36.360> sights<00:01:36.530> so<00:01:37.530> the<00:01:37.619> silencers<00:01:38.100> actually

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
iron sights so the silencers actually

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.719 
iron sights so the silencers actually
reduce<00:01:39.090> the<00:01:39.240> recoil<00:01:39.500> muzzle<00:01:40.500> flash<00:01:40.710> and<00:01:41.070> of

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
reduce the recoil muzzle flash and of

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.130 
reduce the recoil muzzle flash and of
course<00:01:42.030> silence<00:01:42.390> a<00:01:42.450> gun<00:01:42.600> so<00:01:42.750> people<00:01:42.990> can't

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
course silence a gun so people can't

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.740 
course silence a gun so people can't
hear<00:01:43.290> you<00:01:43.440> and<00:01:43.910> they<00:01:44.910> do<00:01:44.970> decrease<00:01:45.420> the<00:01:45.570> guns

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
hear you and they do decrease the guns

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:46.910 
hear you and they do decrease the guns
power<00:01:45.960> but<00:01:46.320> it's<00:01:46.440> fine<00:01:46.590> if<00:01:46.710> you're<00:01:46.830> playing

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
power but it's fine if you're playing

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.070 
power but it's fine if you're playing
hardcore<00:01:47.220> mode<00:01:47.550> I<00:01:47.759> mean<00:01:48.450> it's<00:01:48.750> already<00:01:48.900> like

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:49.080 
hardcore mode I mean it's already like

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.140 
hardcore mode I mean it's already like
one<00:01:49.320> or<00:01:49.440> two<00:01:49.470> it's<00:01:49.680> skill<00:01:50.009> and<00:01:50.250> I've<00:01:50.850> stopping

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:51.150 
one or two it's skill and I've stopping

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:55.100 
one or two it's skill and I've stopping
power<00:01:51.270> anyways<00:01:52.700> and<00:01:53.700> watch<00:01:54.060> here<00:01:54.360> I<00:01:54.540> jump<00:01:54.930> and

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
power anyways and watch here I jump and

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.290 
power anyways and watch here I jump and
then<00:01:55.259> I<00:01:55.320> call<00:01:55.560> me<00:01:55.710> UAV<00:01:56.070> in<00:01:56.160> midair<00:01:56.340> I<00:01:56.729> do<00:01:57.119> this

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:57.300 
then I call me UAV in midair I do this

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:58.700 
then I call me UAV in midair I do this
because<00:01:57.360> otherwise<00:01:57.899> it<00:01:58.229> would<00:01:58.320> slow<00:01:58.470> me<00:01:58.680> down

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
because otherwise it would slow me down

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.790 
because otherwise it would slow me down
and<00:01:59.180> it's<00:02:00.180> not<00:02:00.330> a<00:02:00.360> big<00:02:00.509> deal<00:02:00.570> but<00:02:00.750> still<00:02:01.560> saves

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:01.800 
and it's not a big deal but still saves

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:02.870 
and it's not a big deal but still saves
a<00:02:01.860> little<00:02:02.040> bit<00:02:02.130> of<00:02:02.160> time<00:02:02.340> if<00:02:02.520> you're<00:02:02.610> trying<00:02:02.790> to

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
a little bit of time if you're trying to

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.169 
a little bit of time if you're trying to
rush<00:02:03.060> like<00:02:03.240> this<00:02:03.390> and<00:02:04.789> I'm<00:02:05.789> just<00:02:05.910> running<00:02:06.060> the

00:02:06.169 --> 00:02:06.179 
rush like this and I'm just running the

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:07.850 
rush like this and I'm just running the
same<00:02:06.330> route<00:02:06.509> as<00:02:06.539> last<00:02:06.690> time<00:02:07.020> you<00:02:07.619> don't<00:02:07.770> need

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
same route as last time you don't need

to<00:02:07.950> change<00:02:08.160> your<00:02:08.520> route<00:02:08.819> unless<00:02:09.090> you

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
to change your route unless you

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:12.240 
encounter someone to previous route so I

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.720 
encounter someone to previous route so I
start<00:02:12.720> shooting<00:02:12.870> and<00:02:13.080> this<00:02:13.200> guy<00:02:13.380> but<00:02:14.190> when<00:02:14.670> he

drops<00:02:14.970> behind<00:02:15.180> the<00:02:15.390> boxes<00:02:15.750> he's<00:02:15.959> not<00:02:16.110> afraid

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
drops behind the boxes he's not afraid

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:17.870

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.030 
anymore at least for the next second or
two<00:02:18.030> so<00:02:18.810> I<00:02:18.840> switched<00:02:19.170> my<00:02:19.290> focus<00:02:19.650> to<00:02:19.740> the<00:02:19.800> guy<00:02:19.950> in

chance to reload and as I reload I see

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.220 
chance to reload and as I reload I see
new<00:02:29.459> tube<00:02:29.700> fly<00:02:30.000> out<00:02:30.060> the<00:02:30.240> window<00:02:30.270> on<00:02:30.900> my<00:02:31.020> right

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
killed since i reloaded so I know I must

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.390 
killed since i reloaded so I know I must
be<00:02:42.090> running<00:02:42.330> low<00:02:42.450> on<00:02:42.480> ammo<00:02:42.980> and<00:02:43.980> I<00:02:44.190> hit<00:02:44.310> the

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
be running low on ammo and I hit the

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.430 
be running low on ammo and I hit the
last<00:02:44.550> guy<00:02:44.700> once<00:02:44.940> run<00:02:45.630> out<00:02:45.750> of<00:02:45.780> hand

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
last guy once run out of hand

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.710 
last guy once run out of hand
but<00:02:47.190> instead<00:02:47.490> of<00:02:47.610> reloading<00:02:47.850> it's<00:02:48.210> past<00:02:48.510> her

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
but instead of reloading it's past her

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.420 
but instead of reloading it's past her
to<00:02:48.840> switch<00:02:49.020> to<00:02:49.170> a<00:02:49.200> secondary<00:02:49.590> weapon<00:02:49.950> you

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
to switch to a secondary weapon you

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.400 
to switch to a secondary weapon you
learn<00:02:50.580> that<00:02:50.730> in<00:02:50.790> the<00:02:50.970> campaign<00:02:51.330> mode<00:02:51.540> and<00:02:51.960> it

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
learn that in the campaign mode and it

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:55.460 
learn that in the campaign mode and it
is<00:02:52.530> true<00:02:52.770> it<00:02:52.980> works<00:02:53.750> so<00:02:54.750> i<00:02:54.780> got<00:02:54.960> my<00:02:55.020> air<00:02:55.230> strike

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
is true it works so i got my air strike

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:58.130 
is true it works so i got my air strike
I<00:02:55.730> know<00:02:56.730> that<00:02:56.880> they're<00:02:57.120> spawning<00:02:57.360> back<00:02:57.840> inside

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
I know that they're spawning back inside

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:59.570 
I know that they're spawning back inside
this<00:02:58.290> building<00:02:58.470> so<00:02:58.830> i<00:02:58.860> might<00:02:59.130> be<00:02:59.220> better<00:02:59.400> off

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
this building so i might be better off

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:00.860 
this building so i might be better off
saving<00:02:59.880> the<00:03:00.060> air<00:03:00.180> strike<00:03:00.360> until<00:03:00.660> we<00:03:00.780> switch

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
saving the air strike until we switch

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.440 
saving the air strike until we switch
sides<00:03:01.230> but<00:03:02.070> if<00:03:02.340> i<00:03:02.430> were<00:03:02.550> to<00:03:02.640> get<00:03:02.760> a<00:03:02.790> UAV<00:03:03.060> next

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
sides but if i were to get a UAV next

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.390 
sides but if i were to get a UAV next
round<00:03:03.660> it<00:03:03.990> would<00:03:04.230> erase<00:03:04.590> the<00:03:04.740> air<00:03:04.860> strike<00:03:05.160> and

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
round it would erase the air strike and

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.400 
round it would erase the air strike and
I<00:03:05.460> just<00:03:06.000> lose<00:03:06.120> air<00:03:06.360> strike<00:03:06.660> without<00:03:07.170> even

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
I just lose air strike without even

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:08.840 
I just lose air strike without even
getting<00:03:07.500> to<00:03:07.620> use<00:03:07.800> it<00:03:07.980> because<00:03:08.460> you<00:03:08.670> can<00:03:08.820> only

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
getting to use it because you can only

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:11.510 
getting to use it because you can only
hold<00:03:09.180> one<00:03:09.390> killstreak<00:03:09.990> reward<00:03:10.230> at<00:03:10.290> a<00:03:10.380> time<00:03:10.590> so

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:11.520 
hold one killstreak reward at a time so

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:13.220 
hold one killstreak reward at a time so
I<00:03:11.550> just<00:03:11.850> drop<00:03:12.060> it<00:03:12.180> on<00:03:12.270> this<00:03:12.330> roof<00:03:12.570> over<00:03:13.050> here

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
I just drop it on this roof over here

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.350 
I just drop it on this roof over here
and<00:03:13.380> hope<00:03:13.500> for<00:03:13.530> the<00:03:13.680> best<00:03:13.740> and<00:03:14.460> since<00:03:15.240> there
