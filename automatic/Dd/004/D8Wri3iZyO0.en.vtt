there we go as you see the health bar is
going<00:01:01.329> up<00:01:01.510> and<00:01:01.809> if<00:01:02.530> it<00:01:02.710> goes<00:01:02.829> all<00:01:02.980> the<00:01:03.010> way<00:01:03.069> down

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:03.159 
going up and if it goes all the way down

00:01:03.159 --> 00:01:06.180 
going up and if it goes all the way down
and<00:01:04.470> yeah<00:01:05.470> if<00:01:05.530> it<00:01:05.710> just<00:01:05.800> goes<00:01:05.950> all<00:01:06.100> the<00:01:06.130> way

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:06.190 
and yeah if it just goes all the way

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:08.490 
and yeah if it just goes all the way
down<00:01:06.250> you<00:01:06.580> just<00:01:06.730> basically<00:01:07.000> die<00:01:07.509> so<00:01:08.140> that<00:01:08.170> kind

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:08.500 
down you just basically die so that kind

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.590 
down you just basically die so that kind
of<00:01:08.560> sucks<00:01:08.860> but<00:01:09.189> I<00:01:09.250> guess<00:01:09.880> it's<00:01:10.119> just<00:01:10.210> like<00:01:10.420> the

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:10.600 
of sucks but I guess it's just like the

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.899 
of sucks but I guess it's just like the
Minecraft<00:01:10.960> PC<00:01:11.140> but<00:01:11.649> some<00:01:11.920> when<00:01:12.490> it<00:01:12.610> does<00:01:12.759> go

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:12.909 
Minecraft PC but some when it does go

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:14.819 
Minecraft PC but some when it does go
down<00:01:12.939> and<00:01:13.420> you<00:01:13.479> die<00:01:13.659> when<00:01:13.930> you<00:01:14.020> respawn<00:01:14.530> it

00:01:14.819 --> 00:01:14.829 
down and you die when you respawn it

00:01:14.829 --> 00:01:17.069 
down and you die when you respawn it
just<00:01:15.369> stays<00:01:15.759> like<00:01:16.240> that<00:01:16.270> and<00:01:16.689> then<00:01:16.810> you<00:01:16.869> just

00:01:17.069 --> 00:01:17.079 
just stays like that and then you just

00:01:17.079 --> 00:01:18.660 
just stays like that and then you just
keep<00:01:17.200> dying<00:01:17.500> I'm<00:01:17.740> not<00:01:17.920> sure<00:01:18.100> if<00:01:18.159> that's<00:01:18.310> a<00:01:18.430> bug

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:18.670 
keep dying I'm not sure if that's a bug

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:20.700 
keep dying I'm not sure if that's a bug
or<00:01:18.850> anything<00:01:19.180> like<00:01:19.390> that<00:01:19.450> but<00:01:20.200> it<00:01:20.439> kind<00:01:20.619> of

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:20.710 
or anything like that but it kind of

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:22.620 
or anything like that but it kind of
annoys<00:01:20.950> me<00:01:21.009> but<00:01:21.520> just<00:01:22.060> make<00:01:22.299> sure<00:01:22.329> you

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:22.630 
annoys me but just make sure you

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:24.660 
annoys me but just make sure you
definitely<00:01:23.020> do<00:01:23.140> eat<00:01:23.409> it<00:01:23.680> this<00:01:24.189> is<00:01:24.399> still<00:01:24.579> in

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:24.670 
definitely do eat it this is still in

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:26.850 
definitely do eat it this is still in
beta<00:01:24.820> so<00:01:25.329> I'm<00:01:25.630> guessing<00:01:26.170> it's<00:01:26.350> definitely<00:01:26.799> a

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:26.860 
beta so I'm guessing it's definitely a

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.550 
beta so I'm guessing it's definitely a
bug<00:01:27.070> but<00:01:28.000> as<00:01:28.090> you<00:01:28.210> can<00:01:28.299> see<00:01:28.570> when<00:01:29.200> we<00:01:29.229> try<00:01:29.500> to

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:29.560 
bug but as you can see when we try to

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.450 
bug but as you can see when we try to
eat<00:01:30.119> our<00:01:31.119> hearts<00:01:31.719> don't<00:01:32.170> go<00:01:32.409> up<00:01:32.590> at<00:01:32.799> all<00:01:32.860> so<00:01:33.430> I

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:33.460 
eat our hearts don't go up at all so I

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.639 
eat our hearts don't go up at all so I
think<00:01:33.759> that's<00:01:34.149> a<00:01:34.210> bug<00:01:34.390> as<00:01:34.539> well<00:01:34.750> but<00:01:35.259> I<00:01:35.320> think

00:01:35.639 --> 00:01:35.649 
think that's a bug as well but I think

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:36.899 
think that's a bug as well but I think
it's<00:01:35.740> still<00:01:35.860> pretty<00:01:36.039> cool<00:01:36.369> that<00:01:36.640> there's<00:01:36.850> a

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:36.909 
it's still pretty cool that there's a

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:39.149 
it's still pretty cool that there's a
hunger<00:01:37.210> bar<00:01:37.390> right<00:01:38.079> there<00:01:38.380> in<00:01:38.619> the<00:01:38.710> top<00:01:38.920> left

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:39.159 
hunger bar right there in the top left

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:41.340 
hunger bar right there in the top left
corner<00:01:39.219> so<00:01:39.789> it's<00:01:40.060> still<00:01:40.390> very<00:01:40.420> awesome<00:01:41.200> I'll

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:41.350 
corner so it's still very awesome I'll

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:42.929

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:40.100 
you can see we're sprinting so it does

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:41.559 
you can see we're sprinting so it does
come<00:02:40.250> with<00:02:40.280> sprinting<00:02:40.790> as<00:02:40.910> well<00:02:41.150> I<00:02:41.360> don't

00:02:41.559 --> 00:02:41.569
