00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:11.429
 My name is Fabius, I'm a surgeon. 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:15.420
 dentist I took the course 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:18.150
 private preparation theoretical course 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.699
 I prepared myself to take the test of the anac and 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.090
 I will now start classes classes 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.090
 practices 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:31.169
 first I always go, we have a 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.270
 expectation that it is the best 

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:36.629
 possible but we come with the intention 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:39.300
 to learn and see what the minister 

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:41.820
 pass on to people not worried about 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:45.690
 Yes, I will no longer know the 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:47.519
 machine and adapt it to the way back 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.680
 The time to pass on to us one 

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:52.949
 preparation is not simple is a course 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:56.460
 are five tests that can be 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:58.890
 provided is the well- pulled chuchu 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.329
 you do not have persistence there are people at 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.480
 times that they can not go beyond 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:06.050
 first but can not give up is 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.050
 quiet 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:14.600
 It took me six months to take the course. 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:18.010
 I did the tests and now I'm 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.010
 to make the new paths 

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:14.370
 the fable student made the initial flight today in 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:16.380
 that we take this student with an area 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.570
 of training a little further away 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:21.380
 that carlos prates airport 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:24.300
 this training we look for 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:26.640
 proceed gradually with the student 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.810
 until they get used to becoming accustomed to 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.390
 aircraft commands 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:34.320
 that way we left did the 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:37.020
 take-off together is me and the student 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:40.260
 we proceeded to undo that this area 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:42.630
 environment provides the initial training 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:45.800
 with the first goals of the student and there 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:48.060
 in this area we made the apasc 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:50.610
 operation of controls 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:54.209
 the student initially commands or becomes 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:56.070
 would be the main command that controls 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:56.670
 the main flight attitudes of the 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:58.830
 aircraft 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:02.130
 in this way we made variations of 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:06.090
 speed and curves 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:08.489
 synchronized 360 degrees and 180 degrees 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:10.530
 the performance of the fable was excellent as 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:13.500
 the first flight with the first contact 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:15.900
 with the machine kept calm kept the 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:18.570
 tranquility mainly the softness 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:24.140
 commands which is a predominant factor 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:24.140
 for a controlled flight on a safe flight
