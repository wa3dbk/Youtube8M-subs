and the airfield operations we do it by
being<00:01:09.030> very<00:01:09.299> very<00:01:09.510> flexible<00:01:10.080> as<00:01:10.290> we<00:01:10.470> have<00:01:10.650> to

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
being very very flexible as we have to

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.950 
being very very flexible as we have to
quite<00:01:11.790> a<00:01:11.820> few<00:01:12.090> of<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.270> aircraft<00:01:12.630> that<00:01:12.750> are

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
quite a few of the aircraft that are

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.660 
quite a few of the aircraft that are
validating<00:01:13.560> especially<00:01:13.920> today<00:01:14.189> such<00:01:14.460> as<00:01:14.490> the

Vulcan<00:01:17.580> I<00:01:17.670> believe<00:01:17.850> had<00:01:18.030> a<00:01:18.060> radial<00:01:18.479> problem<00:01:18.810> in

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
Vulcan I believe had a radial problem in

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.440 
Vulcan I believe had a radial problem in
Bound<00:01:19.140> which<00:01:19.320> meant<00:01:19.619> that<00:01:19.740> a<00:01:20.100> departures<00:01:20.970> had

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
Bound which meant that a departures had

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.539 
Bound which meant that a departures had
to<00:01:21.600> be<00:01:21.780> moved<00:01:22.409> slightly<00:01:23.040> in<00:01:23.189> order<00:01:23.280> to
