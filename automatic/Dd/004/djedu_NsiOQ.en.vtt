00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.350
 hello everyone with you video edition upper.ru 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:09.000
 today we will tell you about the future about 

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:10.980
 fantastic but quite feasible 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.630
 you know what happens after the release 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.240
 new iphone literally through 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.250
 a week or two everybody starts thinking about 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.770
 what will be the next iphone 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.260
 and sometimes these thoughts cause 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.720
 the emergence of so cool concepts that 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.640
 any science fiction writer today we 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.830
 made your own hit parade of 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.779
 concepts that are quite possible 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.890
 be carried out is his family or not 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.410
 will come true 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.320
 time will tell it will be possible 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.780
 iphone all the same learn to open beer 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.030
 will replace the razor and the hair dryer will help to catch 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:45.360
 We do not know the mice, but look 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.700
 farther so 6 best best 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.370
 interesting and crazy concepts 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:53.039
 iPhone 6 is the last place of our 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.170
 hit parade takes the idea that apple 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.719
 finally admits to being jealous 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.270
 some pretty good ideas of their own 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:02.969
 competitors and even themselves want to make 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.460
 Apple is the real iphone shovel 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.500
 here it seems colored and in very 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.710
 wide perhaps this idea is really 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.810
 good because many are already 5 smartphones 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.810
 represented so wide and remained 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:18.119
 very disappointed with the modifications of this 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.369
 concept can be called another idea 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.830
 which wanders from year to year but not 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:25.290
 realized coming on apparently 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:28.290
 sloths who love to scroll 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.920
 pages and so very long iphone 6 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.229
 as you will not fit in the bag but 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.509
 it's normal to think apple is fast 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:37.759
 will arrange the supply of special ousik for 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:40.820
 long iphone which will soon become 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:43.070
 A little hint of fashion, but let's continue the next place. 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:45.590
 our hit parade takes up something 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:47.810
 crazier than long-long smartphones 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.789
 we have long suspected that the newest 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:52.460
 scientific breakthroughs will not be made 

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:55.130
 ordinary laboratories in apple 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:57.110
 corporations and so iphone 6 are capable 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:59.570
 move its owner in time 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.729
 cool truth you only need 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:04.460
 set up the required time and a little 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:06.530
 wait this feature is available for both 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:09.019
 traveling forward and backward in 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:11.360
 time was quite possibly invented 

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:13.940
 Jobs still in life but kept on 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.980
 several generations of smartphones forward with 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.500
 using her you can remind yourself of 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.780
 past you need not forget the key or 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:23.540
 see in advance how favorite played 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:26.180
 team samsung owners will just die 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.780
 from envy although most likely to buy yourself 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:29.510
 iphone 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:32.209
 go back in time and warn yourself about 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:34.610
 not spending money on an apple better 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:36.650
 not worth our fourth place 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:38.590
 concept hit chart takes no longer 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:41.600
 so amazing but more 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:43.609
 realistic idea it concerns design and 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:46.790
 it's really important truth after all 

00:02:43.609 --> 00:02:49.459
 look at the screen 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:52.000
 just crossed all the boundaries and completely 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:54.859
 got rid of the framework looks great 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.200
 third place charts again 

00:02:54.859 --> 00:02:59.420
 same design decision they say that 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.970
 it is she who is closest to the truth 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:04.100
 let's look at this concept view 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:06.799
 on fallen american desire for 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:10.310
 the slimness of the iphone 6 became just 

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:13.370
 very, very thin it would seem much more 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:15.980
 and more elegant but look it is possible 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:18.530
 some still waiting for the gadget to become 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:20.650
 generally transparent but we believe that this 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:23.480
 only a subtype of a thin concept 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:25.519
 Holographic second place 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:28.250
 iphone it will be so of course not 

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:28.830
 only partially but completely 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:30.990
 everything 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:33.720
 but great you only see how 

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:35.850
 the screen is very beautiful 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:38.040
 after all , unlike a long device 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:40.440
 saves a huge amount of space 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:43.860
 honorable first place of our hit parade 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:46.050
 iphone 6 concept takes aimak then 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:48.330
 There is not himself aimak of course but only 

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:51.150
 fantastic opportunity to make from 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:53.640
 smartphones full computer yes what 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:56.130
 using a special iphone projector 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:59.180
 turns into such a technological 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:01.920
 miracle what can we say see for yourself 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:04.740
 we would love to use ourselves 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:07.590
 such and believe that this is the future and 

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:10.050
 what did you like what features design 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:12.180
 would you like to see in the new iphone 6 

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:14.970
 be sure to share your opinion in 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:19.190
 comments and likes were with you
