00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:20.420 
paper we should be better than them

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:22.510

we're<00:03:20.870> at<00:03:20.989> league<00:03:21.230> above<00:03:21.530> them<00:03:21.830> what<00:03:22.370> you

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:22.520 
we're at league above them what you

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:24.400 
we're at league above them what you

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:24.410 
think was the difference today and well

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:26.680

it's<00:03:24.709> always<00:03:25.160> like<00:03:25.489> there<00:03:26.239> and<00:03:26.450> there<00:03:26.569> about

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:26.690 
it's always like there and there about

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:28.510 
it's always like there and there about
like<00:03:27.050> they<00:03:27.350> went<00:03:27.620> down<00:03:27.860> and<00:03:28.040> league<00:03:28.130> last<00:03:28.400> year

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:28.520
