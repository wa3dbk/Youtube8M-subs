00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:08.630 
you're breathing in and out and that way
you<00:03:06.750> can<00:03:06.930> kind<00:03:07.110> of<00:03:07.170> form<00:03:07.470> like<00:03:07.710> a<00:03:07.800> nice<00:03:07.980> snarly

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
you can kind of form like a nice snarly

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:43.300 
you can kind of form like a nice snarly
grow

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:43.310 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:46.850 

that's<00:03:44.310> pretty<00:03:44.610> much<00:03:44.760> it<00:03:45.170> and<00:03:46.170> you<00:03:46.590> know<00:03:46.680> as

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:46.860 
that's pretty much it and you know as

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:49.040 
that's pretty much it and you know as
you<00:03:46.970> get<00:03:47.970> more<00:03:48.210> and<00:03:48.270> more<00:03:48.390> into<00:03:48.720> the<00:03:48.810> ground

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:49.050 
you get more and more into the ground

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:52.100 
you get more and more into the ground
you<00:03:49.290> can<00:03:49.350> do<00:03:50.100> a<00:03:50.130> little<00:03:50.370> bit<00:03:50.520> better<00:03:50.610> right<00:03:51.110> now

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:52.110 
you can do a little bit better right now

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:55.370 
you can do a little bit better right now
by<00:03:53.060> paddling<00:03:54.060> more<00:03:54.360> water<00:03:54.600> my<00:03:54.810> mouth<00:03:54.990> wasn't

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:55.380 
by paddling more water my mouth wasn't

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:57.740 
by paddling more water my mouth wasn't
so<00:03:55.620> dry<00:03:56.250> for<00:03:56.550> my<00:03:56.670> soda<00:03:56.940> that<00:03:57.150> I<00:03:57.210> just<00:03:57.420> drank<00:03:57.570> I'd

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
so dry for my soda that I just drank I'd

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:59.960 
so dry for my soda that I just drank I'd
probably<00:03:57.930> do<00:03:58.260> it<00:03:58.290> better<00:03:58.500> but<00:03:58.680> I'm<00:03:59.670> out<00:03:59.820> it's

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
probably do it better but I'm out it's

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:02.930 
probably do it better but I'm out it's
kind<00:04:00.150> of<00:04:00.240> sticky<00:04:01.110> from<00:04:01.500> I<00:04:02.010> guess<00:04:02.760> although

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
kind of sticky from I guess although

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:07.420 
kind of sticky from I guess although
still<00:04:03.450> this<00:04:03.570> again<00:04:04.430> sort<00:04:05.430> of<00:04:05.520> stuff<00:04:05.850> so

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:07.430 
still this again sort of stuff so

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:09.560 
still this again sort of stuff so
probably<00:04:08.430> have<00:04:08.580> to<00:04:08.670> see<00:04:08.790> if<00:04:08.910> I<00:04:08.970> can<00:04:09.120> redo<00:04:09.420> this

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:09.570 
probably have to see if I can redo this

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:11.240 
probably have to see if I can redo this
I<00:04:09.750> haven't<00:04:10.230> just<00:04:10.350> down<00:04:10.500> to<00:04:10.650> the<00:04:10.710> entire<00:04:10.890> set<00:04:11.220> of

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250 
I haven't just down to the entire set of

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:14.810 
I haven't just down to the entire set of
thing<00:04:11.430> but<00:04:12.410> hopefully<00:04:13.410> this<00:04:13.710> helped<00:04:14.250> some<00:04:14.790> of

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:14.820 
thing but hopefully this helped some of

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:16.400 
thing but hopefully this helped some of
