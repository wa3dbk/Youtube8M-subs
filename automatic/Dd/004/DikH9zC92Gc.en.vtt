to<00:03:24.590> make<00:03:24.620> his<00:03:25.250> fine<00:03:25.579> self<00:03:25.609> just<00:03:26.299> just<00:03:27.609> yet<00:03:28.609> just

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:28.639 
to make his fine self just just yet just

00:03:28.639 --> 00:03:32.020 
to make his fine self just just yet just
use<00:03:29.209> a<00:03:29.449> silencer<00:03:29.829> because<00:03:30.829> if<00:03:31.099> you<00:03:31.310> want<00:03:31.819> to

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030

mean rush you don't want them to know
where<00:03:35.870> they<00:03:35.959> are<00:03:35.989> because<00:03:36.349> you<00:03:36.560> can't<00:03:36.949> flank

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:37.220 
where they are because you can't flank

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:39.189 
where they are because you can't flank
on<00:03:37.340> it<00:03:37.519> and<00:03:38.090> that's<00:03:38.299> basically<00:03:38.540> been<00:03:38.900> a<00:03:38.930> part

00:03:39.189 --> 00:03:39.199 
on it and that's basically been a part

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:42.189 
on it and that's basically been a part
of<00:03:39.319> ninja<00:03:39.799> which<00:03:40.009> is<00:03:40.189> also<00:03:40.639> thought<00:03:41.090> of<00:03:41.199> learn

a swarm and like a lone star they like
they<00:03:58.219> can't<00:03:58.609> belittle<00:03:58.939> because<00:04:00.219> it's<00:04:01.219> just

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:01.900 
they can't belittle because it's just

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:04.209 
they can't belittle because it's just
they<00:04:02.900> want<00:04:03.169> to<00:04:03.349> get<00:04:03.469> their<00:04:03.530> kill<00:04:03.769> streaks<00:04:04.069> but
