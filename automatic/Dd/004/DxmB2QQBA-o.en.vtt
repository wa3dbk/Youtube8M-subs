00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:13.619
 Hello dear friends, please 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.869
 forgiveness that I squint the rock of that 

00:00:13.619 --> 00:00:17.630
 me gram sun shines many groups in 

00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:19.560
 contact and comments on youtube 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:22.439
 advised and asked to draw such 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:26.759
 function as anti puddles that she is 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:28.320
 poses down the door and stick 

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:30.119
 any student lighting fixture then 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:34.050
 diode tape or you just partially 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:35.460
 that is, the individual diodes and it shifts 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.890
 This function was opened when 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.370
 the door she highlights you area in 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.500
 zone 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.660
 where do you insert your leg when leaving 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.850
 car but from this option same to 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:49.800
 refused and argued that 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:52.079
 I have the ceiling salon which in principle 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.269
 his light combines both these 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.370
 sin functions bright as in the salon in the evening 

00:00:54.269 --> 00:00:57.000
 so when you open the door and sunbathe 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:02.089
 light not 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:05.790
 and illuminates the exit area of ​​the car 

00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:08.130
 in view of which many questions have arisen with 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.040
 request to show how I have this ceiling 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.840
 implemented or damn it I myself 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.290
 My friend sold me his grant 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.110
 and 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.570
 my grants actually gave me this 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.370
 the very ceiling today we will talk 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.130
 how to make exactly the same ceiling 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:25.680
 so that it combines two functions as 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:28.410
 minimum interior lighting in the dark 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.150
 days and anti puddle option 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:34.980
 let's go about the dental and see how it is 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:37.110
 the very same ceiling us to do to 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:39.720
 remove the cover sony we need any 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:43.220
 a sharp object well in my case it is a knife 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:47.640
 from the glove compartment to hook on the right side 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:51.480
 he just throws out our hands 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:54.660
 disconnect pressing petal wiring and 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:56.790
 we take the cover hands and legs limit 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:59.310
 replacing the standard incandescent lamp in 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.620
 the ceiling on the diode 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.540
 as a good option because the lamp 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:06.270
 diode costs 100 150 rubles on average 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:09.869
 us this world is not very much frankly 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.349
 moms same case applies fees of 6 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.750
 diodes 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:15.720
 can develop another third then but 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:18.150
 then sony light was very bright and 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:21.720
 it would be unpleasant for the eyes so here 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:23.910
 namely 6 diodes they are practically not 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:27.030
 bask so that the ceiling as you can see 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:30.240
 use it for over 200 years probably 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:32.460
 he is as good as new to montage 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:33.090
 required thermo-glue that is the site 

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:35.970
 diode 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:38.550
 were fixed on hot melt glue sit very 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:42.600
 firmly not dangle on the go and 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:44.220
 from the pros and cons of the sites themselves to 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:47.150
 pluses and minuses on the contact group 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:50.209
 the luminaire were wired and 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:54.030
 soldered by ordinary solder 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:56.400
 ordinary soldering iron and principle on 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:59.640
 this here after the Mardan case modernization 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:01.500
 ceiling capable eyes completed then 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:05.010
 I don't know how much it costs 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:07.640
 site but also thought on the car market and in 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:11.700
 radio engineering will be able to find it and 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:13.980
 put a plus this cover is 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:17.340
 what he looks like a factory that is 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:20.370
 Naturally on the drive and there on the Internet 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:23.459
 There are many ways to make the ceiling 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:25.170
 diode fully but it does not look 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:28.019
 very beautiful in this case which bridge 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:30.920
 see all we see is 6 yellow 

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:33.810
 maize ok these same diodes and 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:35.550
 Basically everything that is, when working, he 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:38.120
 It seems absolutely factory as if 

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:40.590
 it was originally intended 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:43.350
 rugged design has proved about 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:44.850
 myself for several years now 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:47.940
 that's how I use it 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:49.980
 the ceiling and how I would not know troubles think us 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:52.410
 mail take the night shots you will see how 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:55.709
 this lamp shines at night in the cabin and how 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:59.549
 his suite is enough to cover the zone 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:04:02.850
 getting out of the car well, on this principle 

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:05.040
 all back 

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:09.180
 bad is also very easy to mount 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:14.100
 there are connect the wiring and snap 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:15.780
 the ceiling in your frame on it all forget 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:18.440
 like subscribe to the channel 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:18.440
 see you
