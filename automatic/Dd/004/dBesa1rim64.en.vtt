00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.069
 all right 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.980
 This is a practical and easy machine 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.469
 use applicable to a wide variety of 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:16.230
 fabrics straight seam comfortable and light for 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:19.640
 travel that contains a foot pedal that 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.640
 is connected to the back 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.369
 and a power adapter makes for 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.759
 operate the engine that is two 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:35.120
 speeds goes connected down the pedal 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.120
 O well 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:40.420
 or they can also place four 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:42.640
 double batteries in the compartment 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:44.760
 down that does its right 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.760
 functioning 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.829
 it also contains four coils one 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:55.030
 needle 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:55.030
 and a threading 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:02.230
 today we will show you how we should 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:03.820
 Insert the thread into the holes for 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:05.379
 have a correct functioning to 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:07.390
 moment of things the mini machine has 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:10.630
 a thread axis where you can place the 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:13.360
 reel or a support where the 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:15.670
 coil you can work with both them 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.430
 I will show how to place the coil 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:21.009
 to have a correct operation 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:23.770
 first is the post later the 

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:25.840
 coil that has to turn from right to 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.900
 left and the thread has to go through 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.380
 down 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:32.469
 after both 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:34.750
 the spring and that's how you put the 

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:36.759
 mini machine with the reel us 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:38.930
 we will work today with the first reel 

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:41.610
 step is of this building 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:44.220
 subsequently in tensing the tensioner is 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.320
 very important since you are given the 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.960
 adequate care so that the thread does not 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.990
 Breaking the thread has to happen in 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.820
 middle of the post above and the post quoted 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.909
 down 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:57.920
 the tensioner is placed 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:59.619
 and it is screwed according to the attention 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:04.030
 that we want to give 

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:04.030
 later it goes in second hole 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:13.460
 and the lifting lever 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:21.450
 we continue with the fourth building 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:28.959
 the needle clamp 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:38.980
 the last point is the needle the needle is 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.980
 you have to place from left to right 

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:46.060
 the next point is the compartment 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:48.990
 from the coil we open the compartment and 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.990
 we take out the coil 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:54.069
 It is placed between the fingers and the reel 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.069
 it has to turn counter to the 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:03:00.150
 clock hands like this and this 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:02.430
 way it is placed on the crab 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:05.110
 this thread has to go through the channel 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:07.270
 from our mini machine 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:09.670
 now the compartment is closed on 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:11.740
 review we have our thread in the first 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:14.230
 hole subsequently in the tensioner 

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:17.530
 third hole for the elevator pnc 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:20.319
 fourth hole 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:22.569
 Needle clamp and needle 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:24.459
 left to right we also have 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:28.200
 our coil compartment 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:28.200
 below and our thread in the channel 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:33.799
 let's start spinning the pulley towards 

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:36.080
 here we are going to see how the needle 

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:39.650
 will go down 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:42.920
 when the needle is up we'll see 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:45.800
 how the mini imagine 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:48.730
 javier and what we have in the crab 

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:48.730
 upwards 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:58.659
 so up our two children 

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:06.300
 we talk both 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:09.210
 and we put them down from prince to fabric 

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:10.980
 with last point we will place in the 

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:12.960
 cloth 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:14.730
 and go down in cloth press 

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:16.590
 I'm going to show you the buttons that 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:17.970
 we have in our mini machine this 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:20.700
 button is to regulate the speed 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:24.210
 when it's tight it means that 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:26.250
 we have low speed and when it 's 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:28.590
 raised we can use it in high 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:30.180
 speed this button is to operate the 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:34.940
 mini machine in case they do not want 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:34.940
 use the pedal the pedal is already this 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:43.070
 first we will talk manually 

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:46.070
 with the button that is in the mini machine 

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:46.070
 A) Yes 

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:51.200
 or with the brake pedal that entered 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:59.810
 and so you can start sewing with your 

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:59.810
 mini sewing machine with 

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:07.210
 this mini machine has a practical 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:08.680
 winding operation which are the 

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:11.200
 coils that are required for the 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:13.990
 Crab if you want to put new thread 

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:15.910
 in the coils what you have to do is 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:18.760
 press the post that is on the pulley 

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:20.410
 and take it from the left side like this 

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:23.290
 get out our plus now we place 

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:24.970
 our coil in the post making sure 

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:27.610
 that remains until the end so that it does not 

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:30.820
 go create our coil we should 

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:33.640
 ensure that the thread is not found 

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:36.030
 placed in the holes to have a 

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:39.160
 correct winding operation 

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:42.340
 later we put the reel in 

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:45.000
 our hands and we press the button 

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:45.000
 functioning 

00:05:48.529 --> 00:05:54.229
 when we finish in a cart all 

00:05:50.629 --> 00:05:57.319
 our coil we cut off our 

00:05:54.229 --> 00:05:59.509
 coil and the post quoted we go back to 

00:05:57.319 --> 00:06:02.049
 put now from the opposite side towards the 

00:05:59.509 --> 00:06:02.049
 right side
