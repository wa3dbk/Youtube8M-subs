00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.020
 Dimka what 

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:17.720
 I asked you to clean the potatoes from 

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:20.390
 what now I will cook dinner ali forgot 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:22.000
 Well, you started playing, you know, if 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:26.420
 anyone would have reminded me i would 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:29.090
 polish listen leg and you can't 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:31.550
 a reminder on whom to put in order not to 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:34.520
 only reminded but also of my conscience 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:35.300
 I called out like this fought against 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:38.180
 zombie 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:42.230
 and the program turns off the game and politely to me 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:45.440
 says to him well are you shorter to yourself 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:48.980
 problems you create let's do lessons already 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:50.480
 by the way and not a bad idea come on tomorrow 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:53.950
 let's go programmer 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.950
 state them the essence of the matter 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.620
 you know lech your brother betrayed good 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:59.930
 the idea 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:00.739
 This program can be a reminder 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:02.930
 go to the masses 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:04.570
 so I'll do it now we are doing mega 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:05.689
 order for a network of German supermarkets 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:08.810
 write 

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:10.490
 itch on the program of wounds will give ist fiction 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:12.890
 as soon as we finish you 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:15.649
 a reminder and why the Germans are not themselves 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:16.580
 can write about drummer n why not 

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:18.229
 can can 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.570
 but we will make it cheaper and better 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:22.430
 so our order is weak for 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.229
 programmer no boundaries and customs 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:26.720
 work even for germany even for 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:28.039
 america wait like you are in america 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.860
 will work 

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:33.440
 from there you will drive to set 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.750
 programs and brother don't you confuse 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:37.610
 install programs to network 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:40.360
 fight viruses this task 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:42.619
 system administrator or sysadmin 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:45.470
 programmers have now even sites not 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:47.240
 write sense don't create them all possible 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:49.700
 variants of sites have long been written by them 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:52.700
 layout makers fill color fonts 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:55.340
 updates and stuff and part then you 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:57.470
 do the programmer is a person who 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.599
 makes the computer perform all new 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:01.399
 and new features such as well, that you 

00:01:59.599 --> 00:02:02.840
 it took a program that wouldn't 

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:06.410
 only reminded of their duties 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:08.270
 but also appealed to your conscience by the way if 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:10.729
 In this program include more analysis 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:12.920
 video and audio she can also follow 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:17.239
 check for you how are you doing your lessons 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:19.160
 and everything else I do not like that yes I 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:21.140
 and I will not be a very expensive program 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:24.319
 It turns out and programmers in general 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:26.569
 normally earn about zuckerberg 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:30.080
 heard who came up with facebook but 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:33.140
 heard something but so here is a man rude 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:35.360
 speaking wrote one program and on this 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:39.280
 built my business it was more 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:42.709
 ten years ago now he is a billionaire 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:44.900
 ok but you donâ€™t roll your lip 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:46.879
 to become at least a millionaire need 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.800
 be not only programmers need to be 

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:51.379
 also the manager of your project 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.459
 but even if you are a pure programmer 

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:54.739
 you can still live 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:57.590
 First of all, our work is well paid. 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:59.629
 secondly, you can live in Bobruisk 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:02.150
 and work figuratively speaking in new york on 

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:04.340
 wall street in third demand for programs 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:06.340
 growing steadily now because everyone in 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:12.220
 not knowing your pocket 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:15.340
 they i'm a computer smartphone but it always 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:17.410
 with me here is the first smartphones too 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:19.870
 turn the computer and then the phone and 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:22.540
 every day there is a new application 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:24.330
 games weather readings ki looked instagram 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:27.250
 and so on listened about 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:29.620
 great job and where do they teach on 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:31.299
 programmers up to any university where there is 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:32.080
 specialty computer science and applied 

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:34.780
 maths 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:37.360
 but it doesn't matter if there is talent 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:38.950
 you and without a diploma will take a job or 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:41.110
 generally you can not go to work 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:43.630
 the programmer may well work at home 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:46.030
 if without education then how will I become 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:47.079
 a programmer to start learning languages 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:51.549
 programming 

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:53.980
 and there are a lot of them in general then several thousand 

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:55.450
 popular with a dozen learn at least one 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:57.879
 as native and then you can 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:04:00.819
 talk to the computer in his language 

00:03:57.879 --> 00:04:03.579
 how do you tell him like an expensive computer 

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:06.819
 I need here and here and he will answer you 

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:09.310
 yes no problem just put me 16 

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:12.250
 nuclear processor with a clock frequency of 7 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:13.350
 gigahertz and RAM 86 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:17.019
 gigabyte 

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:19.090
 Well, in general, yes the program is 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:21.400
 essentially having a computer run 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:23.289
 you will learn certain work correctly 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:25.950
 write such orders you consider 

00:04:23.289 --> 00:04:25.950
 programmer 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:33.180
 Dmitriy how are you not ashamed of how much 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:35.389
 you can surf the internet have you forgotten what 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:39.120
 tomorrow you have a control on geometry 

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:39.659
 read ask nose coffee nose well how 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:42.330
 program 

00:04:39.659 --> 00:04:44.729
 it works steadily for me now for sure 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:46.530
 will have to learn from the programmer to 

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:49.340
 at least with your computer in a good way 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:52.189
 agree on that well built here 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:56.120
 totalitarian regime ha ha 

00:04:52.189 --> 00:04:59.120
 the result is unpredictable and but I would say 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:59.120
 positive
