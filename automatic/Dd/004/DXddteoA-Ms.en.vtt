00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:14.440 
I'll be looking at both the front-facing

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:16.499 
I'll be looking at both the front-facing
and<00:00:14.769> rear-facing<00:00:14.890> cameras<00:00:15.580> as<00:00:15.730> well<00:00:16.390> as

00:00:16.499 --> 00:00:16.509 
and rear-facing cameras as well as

00:00:16.509 --> 00:00:20.189 
and rear-facing cameras as well as
images<00:00:17.050> and<00:00:17.259> videos<00:00:17.800> to<00:00:18.099> now<00:00:19.060> do<00:00:19.419> look<00:00:19.869> out<00:00:19.990> for

the audio icon in the corner of the

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:22.950 
the audio icon in the corner of the
screen<00:00:21.669> that<00:00:22.179> will<00:00:22.240> indicate<00:00:22.480> to<00:00:22.630> you<00:00:22.779> which

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:22.960 
screen that will indicate to you which

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.109 
screen that will indicate to you which
device<00:00:23.289> the<00:00:23.470> audio<00:00:23.769> is<00:00:23.890> coming<00:00:24.130> from<00:00:24.249> to<00:00:24.519> I'll

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:25.119 
device the audio is coming from to I'll

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:26.489 
device the audio is coming from to I'll
be<00:00:25.210> switching<00:00:25.539> between<00:00:25.659> these<00:00:26.019> two<00:00:26.230> to<00:00:26.380> give

00:00:26.489 --> 00:00:26.499 
be switching between these two to give

00:00:26.499 --> 00:00:27.479 
be switching between these two to give
you<00:00:26.560> guys<00:00:26.739> a<00:00:26.769> better<00:00:27.069> idea<00:00:27.189> of<00:00:27.429> the

00:00:27.479 --> 00:00:27.489 
you guys a better idea of the

00:00:27.489 --> 00:00:29.609 
you guys a better idea of the
differences<00:00:27.999> in<00:00:28.239> audio<00:00:28.599> as<00:00:28.749> well<00:00:28.779> so

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:29.619 
differences in audio as well so

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:31.109 
differences in audio as well so
initially<00:00:29.800> we<00:00:30.130> are<00:00:30.159> using<00:00:30.519> different<00:00:30.730> facing

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:31.119 
initially we are using different facing

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:33.150 
initially we are using different facing
cameras<00:00:31.390> on<00:00:31.539> both<00:00:31.779> of<00:00:31.929> these<00:00:31.989> devices<00:00:32.320> wherein

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:33.160 
cameras on both of these devices wherein

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.340 
cameras on both of these devices wherein
those<00:00:33.310> with<00:00:33.550> some<00:00:33.790> decent<00:00:34.150> lighting<00:00:34.360> now<00:00:35.170> one

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:35.350 
those with some decent lighting now one

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:37.530 
those with some decent lighting now one
thing<00:00:35.470> to<00:00:35.530> know<00:00:35.830> already<00:00:36.220> is<00:00:36.550> that<00:00:36.580> the<00:00:36.880> s4<00:00:37.240> has

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:37.540 
thing to know already is that the s4 has

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:39.780 
thing to know already is that the s4 has
a<00:00:37.750> 1080p<00:00:38.230> front<00:00:38.560> facing<00:00:38.830> camera<00:00:39.130> whereas<00:00:39.700> the

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:39.790 
a 1080p front facing camera whereas the

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:42.630 
a 1080p front facing camera whereas the
iPhone<00:00:40.090> 5s<00:00:40.660> only<00:00:41.080> has<00:00:41.260> a<00:00:41.470> 720p<00:00:42.040> front<00:00:42.400> facing

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:42.640 
iPhone 5s only has a 720p front facing

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.700 
iPhone 5s only has a 720p front facing
camera<00:00:42.910> so<00:00:43.060> you<00:00:43.420> may<00:00:43.690> notice<00:00:44.050> a<00:00:44.230> difference<00:00:44.590> a

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:44.710 
camera so you may notice a difference a

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:46.140 
camera so you may notice a difference a
straightaway<00:00:45.010> in<00:00:45.190> terms<00:00:45.340> of<00:00:45.460> resolution<00:00:45.730> so

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:46.150 
straightaway in terms of resolution so

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:48.810 
straightaway in terms of resolution so
now<00:00:46.930> let's<00:00:47.170> head<00:00:47.320> outside<00:00:47.470> and<00:00:47.920> test<00:00:48.550> out<00:00:48.670> the

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:48.820 
now let's head outside and test out the

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:50.490 
now let's head outside and test out the
rear<00:00:49.000> facing<00:00:49.180> cameras<00:00:49.600> do<00:00:50.020> hit<00:00:50.170> that<00:00:50.290> thumbs

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:50.500 
rear facing cameras do hit that thumbs

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:51.780 
rear facing cameras do hit that thumbs
up<00:00:50.620> button<00:00:50.680> and<00:00:51.010> let's<00:00:51.160> get<00:00:51.310> straight<00:00:51.430> to<00:00:51.640> it

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:51.790 
up button and let's get straight to it

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:53.820 
up button and let's get straight to it
okay<00:00:52.450> so<00:00:52.510> we're<00:00:52.780> currently<00:00:52.900> outdoors<00:00:53.530> and

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:53.830 
okay so we're currently outdoors and

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:55.320 
okay so we're currently outdoors and
we're<00:00:54.040> using<00:00:54.190> the<00:00:54.460> rear<00:00:54.640> facing<00:00:54.820> cameras<00:00:55.180> on

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:55.330 
we're using the rear facing cameras on

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:58.020 
we're using the rear facing cameras on
both<00:00:55.510> of<00:00:55.690> these<00:00:55.780> devices<00:00:56.520> fortunately<00:00:57.520> it's<00:00:57.760> a

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:58.030 
both of these devices fortunately it's a

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:01.200 
both of these devices fortunately it's a
very<00:00:58.450> very<00:00:58.750> dull<00:00:59.020> day<00:00:59.260> so<00:00:59.920> this<00:01:00.730> is<00:01:00.910> the<00:01:01.030> sole

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:01.210 
very very dull day so this is the sole

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:03.420 
very very dull day so this is the sole
whether<00:01:01.570> you<00:01:01.870> expect<00:01:02.440> in<00:01:02.710> this<00:01:02.860> month<00:01:03.250> where

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:03.430 
whether you expect in this month where

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:05.250 
whether you expect in this month where
I'm<00:01:03.550> from<00:01:03.700> anyway<00:01:04.059> so<00:01:04.629> unfortunately<00:01:05.199> we

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:05.260 
I'm from anyway so unfortunately we

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.740 
I'm from anyway so unfortunately we
can't<00:01:05.500> do<00:01:05.650> too<00:01:05.890> much<00:01:06.070> about<00:01:06.280> that<00:01:06.940> but<00:01:07.570> we're

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:07.750 
can't do too much about that but we're

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:10.800 
can't do too much about that but we're
recording<00:01:08.080> with<00:01:08.230> 1080p<00:01:08.860> on<00:01:09.070> both<00:01:09.909> of<00:01:10.180> the<00:01:10.540> rear

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:10.810 
recording with 1080p on both of the rear

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:12.840 
recording with 1080p on both of the rear
facing<00:01:11.050> cameras<00:01:11.620> and<00:01:11.860> this<00:01:12.250> is<00:01:12.430> the<00:01:12.550> sort<00:01:12.820> of

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:12.850 
facing cameras and this is the sort of

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:14.700 
facing cameras and this is the sort of
quality<00:01:13.270> that<00:01:13.300> you<00:01:13.480> can<00:01:13.720> expect<00:01:14.110> from<00:01:14.200> both<00:01:14.680> of

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:14.710 
quality that you can expect from both of

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:17.010 
quality that you can expect from both of
these<00:01:14.950> here<00:01:15.220> needs<00:01:15.909> some<00:01:16.000> close-up<00:01:16.479> of<00:01:16.630> some

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:17.020 
these here needs some close-up of some

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:18.780 
these here needs some close-up of some
flowers<00:01:17.350> we've<00:01:17.770> got<00:01:17.979> some<00:01:18.190> different<00:01:18.400> colors

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:18.790 
flowers we've got some different colors

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:21.120 
flowers we've got some different colors
you've<00:01:18.970> got<00:01:19.090> some<00:01:19.300> yellows<00:01:20.140> here<00:01:20.440> with<00:01:20.710> some

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:21.130 
you've got some yellows here with some

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:24.450 
you've got some yellows here with some
reds<00:01:22.090> down<00:01:22.750> below<00:01:23.140> so<00:01:23.440> hopefully<00:01:24.250> that<00:01:24.430> gives

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:24.460 
reds down below so hopefully that gives

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.630 
reds down below so hopefully that gives
you<00:01:24.940> a<00:01:25.180> bit<00:01:25.750> of<00:01:25.810> an<00:01:25.960> idea<00:01:26.320> of<00:01:26.380> the<00:01:26.950> differences

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:27.640 
you a bit of an idea of the differences

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.350 
you a bit of an idea of the differences
in<00:01:28.390> quality<00:01:28.630> between<00:01:29.110> these<00:01:29.530> two<00:01:29.740> devices<00:01:30.360> so

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:31.360 
in quality between these two devices so

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.060 
in quality between these two devices so
now<00:01:31.450> we're<00:01:31.630> indoors<00:01:31.960> with<00:01:32.380> the<00:01:32.590> Samsung

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:33.070 
now we're indoors with the Samsung

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:51.880 
point and this is the sort of quality

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.300 
point and this is the sort of quality
that<00:01:52.150> you<00:01:52.240> can<00:01:52.360> expect<00:01:52.720> indoors<00:01:53.560> on<00:01:53.799> the

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:54.310 
that you can expect indoors on the

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:56.940 
that you can expect indoors on the
Samsung<00:01:54.760> Galaxy<00:01:54.790> s4<00:01:55.299> with<00:01:56.170> relatively<00:01:56.770> low

Samsung Galaxy s4 with relatively low

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:00.679 
Samsung Galaxy s4 with relatively low
lighting<00:01:57.189> now<00:01:58.180> we've<00:01:58.360> got<00:01:58.630> the<00:01:58.840> iPhone<00:01:59.460> 5s

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
lighting now we've got the iPhone 5s

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:04.410 
lighting now we've got the iPhone 5s
again<00:02:01.689> same<00:02:02.320> lighting<00:02:02.619> as<00:02:02.950> we<00:02:03.220> had<00:02:03.430> with<00:02:03.939> the

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:04.420 
again same lighting as we had with the

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:07.580 
again same lighting as we had with the
s4<00:02:05.170> and<00:02:05.610> just<00:02:06.610> looking<00:02:06.820> at<00:02:06.909> the<00:02:07.030> autofocus

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
s4 and just looking at the autofocus

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.830 
s4 and just looking at the autofocus
seems<00:02:08.590> to<00:02:08.740> do<00:02:08.860> a<00:02:09.069> pretty<00:02:09.459> decent<00:02:09.550> job<00:02:09.970> and<00:02:10.720> we

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
seems to do a pretty decent job and we

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.920 
seems to do a pretty decent job and we
can<00:02:10.990> also<00:02:11.230> touch<00:02:12.160> to<00:02:12.370> focus<00:02:12.849> if<00:02:13.060> needed

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
can also touch to focus if needed

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.289 
can also touch to focus if needed
and<00:02:14.019> the<00:02:14.769> touch<00:02:14.980> to<00:02:15.129> focus<00:02:15.519> actually<00:02:15.700> works<00:02:16.120> a

00:02:16.289 --> 00:02:16.299 
and the touch to focus actually works a

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:18.839 
and the touch to focus actually works a
lot<00:02:16.659> better<00:02:16.959> than<00:02:17.469> the<00:02:17.620> iPhone<00:02:17.980> 5<00:02:18.250> which<00:02:18.519> is<00:02:18.549> to

00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:18.849 
lot better than the iPhone 5 which is to

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:21.000 
lot better than the iPhone 5 which is to
have<00:02:19.030> that<00:02:19.269> search<00:02:19.659> back<00:02:19.959> and<00:02:20.170> forth<00:02:20.379> but<00:02:20.859> this

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
have that search back and forth but this

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:22.949 
have that search back and forth but this
is<00:02:21.159> the<00:02:21.310> sort<00:02:21.519> of<00:02:21.549> quality<00:02:21.790> that<00:02:22.659> you<00:02:22.810> can

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959 
is the sort of quality that you can

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:26.369 
is the sort of quality that you can
expect<00:02:23.409> with<00:02:23.709> the<00:02:23.920> iPhone<00:02:24.400> 5s<00:02:25.090> so<00:02:26.049> that<00:02:26.200> was

00:02:26.369 --> 00:02:26.379 
expect with the iPhone 5s so that was

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:28.289 
expect with the iPhone 5s so that was
the<00:02:26.530> video<00:02:26.829> now<00:02:27.040> let's<00:02:27.250> have<00:02:27.489> a<00:02:27.549> look<00:02:27.939> at<00:02:28.090> some

00:02:28.289 --> 00:02:28.299 
the video now let's have a look at some

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:29.849 
the video now let's have a look at some
images<00:02:28.420> we'll<00:02:28.840> begin<00:02:29.019> with<00:02:29.379> the<00:02:29.560> front-facing

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:29.859 
images we'll begin with the front-facing

00:02:29.859 --> 00:02:33.209 
images we'll begin with the front-facing
cameras<00:02:30.489> so<00:02:30.969> here<00:02:31.209> are<00:02:31.510> some<00:02:31.780> selfies<00:02:32.620> that

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:33.219 
cameras so here are some selfies that

00:02:33.219 --> 00:02:35.819 
cameras so here are some selfies that
everybody<00:02:33.609> uses<00:02:34.000> on<00:02:34.150> Instagram<00:02:34.689> and<00:02:34.900> you<00:02:35.680> can

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:35.829 
everybody uses on Instagram and you can

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:36.990 
everybody uses on Instagram and you can
see<00:02:35.950> the<00:02:36.069> differences<00:02:36.549> here

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
see the differences here

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.599 
see the differences here
I'd<00:02:37.180> say<00:02:37.510> the<00:02:37.689> iPhone<00:02:38.079> 5s<00:02:38.500> has<00:02:38.829> more<00:02:39.189> warmer

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:39.609 
I'd say the iPhone 5s has more warmer

00:02:39.609 --> 00:02:41.580 
I'd say the iPhone 5s has more warmer
tones<00:02:39.819> whereas<00:02:40.239> the<00:02:40.389> s4<00:02:40.930> has<00:02:41.139> the<00:02:41.319> cooler

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
tones whereas the s4 has the cooler

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:43.830 
tones whereas the s4 has the cooler
tones<00:02:41.859> now<00:02:42.609> if<00:02:42.849> you<00:02:42.939> look<00:02:43.090> at<00:02:43.209> my<00:02:43.329> jacket<00:02:43.599> the

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
tones now if you look at my jacket the

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.860 
tones now if you look at my jacket the
leather<00:02:44.049> jacket<00:02:44.500> I<00:02:44.650> do<00:02:44.980> think<00:02:45.459> that<00:02:45.519> the<00:02:46.090> s4<00:02:46.569> is

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
leather jacket I do think that the s4 is

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:48.599 
leather jacket I do think that the s4 is
doing<00:02:47.230> a<00:02:47.290> better<00:02:47.409> job<00:02:47.620> with<00:02:47.889> the<00:02:47.950> detail<00:02:48.189> on

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:48.609 
doing a better job with the detail on

00:02:48.609 --> 00:02:50.099 
doing a better job with the detail on
here<00:02:48.849> as<00:02:49.000> well<00:02:49.030> as<00:02:49.269> the<00:02:49.389> colors<00:02:49.720> a<00:02:49.750> little<00:02:49.870> bit

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:50.109 
here as well as the colors a little bit

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:53.520 
here as well as the colors a little bit
more<00:02:50.230> accurate<00:02:50.650> on<00:02:50.859> the<00:02:51.489> s4<00:02:51.970> moving<00:02:52.870> on<00:02:53.049> to<00:02:53.319> an

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
more accurate on the s4 moving on to an

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:55.319 
more accurate on the s4 moving on to an
outdoor<00:02:53.769> shot<00:02:54.340> we've<00:02:54.519> got<00:02:54.549> some<00:02:54.849> flowers<00:02:55.090> here

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:55.329 
outdoor shot we've got some flowers here

00:02:55.329 --> 00:02:57.569 
outdoor shot we've got some flowers here
lots<00:02:55.599> of<00:02:55.750> color<00:02:56.079> both<00:02:56.739> are<00:02:56.950> doing<00:02:57.129> a<00:02:57.250> very<00:02:57.459> very

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:57.579 
lots of color both are doing a very very

00:02:57.579 --> 00:03:00.300 
lots of color both are doing a very very
good<00:02:58.120> job<00:02:58.299> here<00:02:59.019> I'd<00:02:59.379> say<00:02:59.560> the<00:02:59.680> iPhone<00:02:59.950> 5s

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
good job here I'd say the iPhone 5s

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:02.849 
good job here I'd say the iPhone 5s
again<00:03:00.549> a<00:03:00.579> little<00:03:00.819> bit<00:03:00.939> warmer<00:03:01.389> but<00:03:01.620> both<00:03:02.620> are

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:02.859 
again a little bit warmer but both are

00:03:02.859 --> 00:03:04.800 
again a little bit warmer but both are
doing<00:03:03.040> a<00:03:03.129> very<00:03:03.310> good<00:03:03.400> job<00:03:03.549> and<00:03:04.000> lots<00:03:04.450> of<00:03:04.569> color

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
doing a very good job and lots of color

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:06.809 
doing a very good job and lots of color
and<00:03:04.870> detail<00:03:05.319> on<00:03:05.500> both<00:03:05.680> of<00:03:05.859> these<00:03:05.950> images<00:03:06.219> now

00:03:06.809 --> 00:03:06.819 
and detail on both of these images now

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:08.009 
and detail on both of these images now
one<00:03:06.969> of<00:03:07.000> the<00:03:07.150> things<00:03:07.299> that<00:03:07.419> you<00:03:07.540> do<00:03:07.719> have<00:03:07.989> to

00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:08.019 
one of the things that you do have to

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:10.649 
one of the things that you do have to
bear<00:03:08.469> in<00:03:08.590> mind<00:03:08.620> is<00:03:08.980> that<00:03:09.340> the<00:03:09.579> s4<00:03:09.909> has<00:03:09.939> a<00:03:10.239> 13

00:03:10.649 --> 00:03:10.659 
bear in mind is that the s4 has a 13

00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:12.899 
bear in mind is that the s4 has a 13
megapixel<00:03:11.230> camera<00:03:11.260> whereas<00:03:11.799> the<00:03:11.919> iPhone<00:03:12.310> 5s

00:03:12.899 --> 00:03:12.909 
megapixel camera whereas the iPhone 5s

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:15.869 
megapixel camera whereas the iPhone 5s
has<00:03:13.329> an<00:03:13.689> 8<00:03:13.900> megapixel<00:03:14.139> camera<00:03:14.439> so<00:03:15.250> if<00:03:15.370> we<00:03:15.519> do<00:03:15.669> go

00:03:15.869 --> 00:03:15.879 
has an 8 megapixel camera so if we do go

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:18.509 
has an 8 megapixel camera so if we do go
into<00:03:16.060> 100%<00:03:16.989> you<00:03:17.439> can<00:03:17.590> clearly<00:03:17.799> see<00:03:17.919> here<00:03:18.340> that

00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:18.519 
into 100% you can clearly see here that

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:21.089 
into 100% you can clearly see here that
the<00:03:18.699> s4<00:03:19.299> has<00:03:19.750> a<00:03:19.810> lot<00:03:20.199> more<00:03:20.229> detail<00:03:20.500> and<00:03:20.889> it's<00:03:20.979> a

00:03:21.089 --> 00:03:21.099 
the s4 has a lot more detail and it's a

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:22.830 
the s4 has a lot more detail and it's a
larger<00:03:21.430> image<00:03:21.579> as<00:03:21.819> well<00:03:22.000> so<00:03:22.150> you<00:03:22.239> can<00:03:22.389> crop<00:03:22.629> in

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
larger image as well so you can crop in

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.710 
larger image as well so you can crop in
further<00:03:23.109> on<00:03:23.409> the<00:03:23.680> s4<00:03:24.220> and<00:03:24.430> on<00:03:24.909> the<00:03:25.000> iPhone<00:03:25.120> 5s

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720 
further on the s4 and on the iPhone 5s

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.330 
further on the s4 and on the iPhone 5s
it's<00:03:26.079> still<00:03:26.260> a<00:03:26.290> decent<00:03:26.560> image<00:03:26.949> but<00:03:27.250> I'll

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.340 
it's still a decent image but I'll

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:29.099 
it's still a decent image but I'll
definitely<00:03:27.729> give<00:03:27.879> at<00:03:28.090> the<00:03:28.269> edge<00:03:28.449> here<00:03:28.780> to<00:03:28.959> the

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:29.109 
definitely give at the edge here to the

00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:31.050 
definitely give at the edge here to the
s4<00:03:29.470> because<00:03:29.769> of<00:03:29.979> that<00:03:30.220> high<00:03:30.430> resolution

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:35.139 
image this time and there was an

00:03:35.139 --> 00:03:37.469 
image this time and there was an
overcast<00:03:35.379> and<00:03:36.040> just<00:03:36.549> a<00:03:36.699> plain<00:03:36.939> white<00:03:36.970> in<00:03:37.359> the

00:03:37.479 --> 00:03:40.409 
overcast and just a plain white in the
sky<00:03:37.720> as<00:03:37.780> you<00:03:37.900> can<00:03:38.139> see<00:03:38.319> here<00:03:38.680> now<00:03:38.829> both<00:03:39.790> seem<00:03:40.299> to

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:40.419 
sky as you can see here now both seem to

00:03:40.419 --> 00:03:42.119 
sky as you can see here now both seem to
be<00:03:40.510> doing<00:03:40.750> quite<00:03:40.870> similarly<00:03:41.409> here<00:03:41.709> I<00:03:41.889> would

00:03:42.119 --> 00:03:42.129 
be doing quite similarly here I would

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:44.339 
be doing quite similarly here I would
say<00:03:42.310> that<00:03:42.489> the<00:03:42.609> s4<00:03:42.970> has<00:03:43.150> a<00:03:43.209> tad<00:03:43.629> more<00:03:43.659> contrast

00:03:44.339 --> 00:03:44.349 
say that the s4 has a tad more contrast

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:47.069 
say that the s4 has a tad more contrast
than<00:03:44.560> the<00:03:45.009> iPhone<00:03:45.340> 5s<00:03:45.970> but<00:03:46.000> not<00:03:46.389> huge<00:03:46.599> deal<00:03:46.840> of

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:47.079 
than the iPhone 5s but not huge deal of

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:49.559 
than the iPhone 5s but not huge deal of
difference<00:03:47.319> here<00:03:47.739> now<00:03:48.189> looking<00:03:48.519> at<00:03:48.729> an<00:03:49.000> indoor

00:03:49.559 --> 00:03:49.569 
difference here now looking at an indoor

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:52.559 
difference here now looking at an indoor
image<00:03:50.019> in<00:03:50.259> a<00:03:50.829> good<00:03:51.069> lighting<00:03:51.579> now<00:03:52.030> both<00:03:52.299> are

00:03:52.559 --> 00:03:52.569 
image in a good lighting now both are

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:55.170 
image in a good lighting now both are
quite<00:03:52.900> similar<00:03:53.259> again<00:03:53.680> I'd<00:03:53.859> say<00:03:54.159> the<00:03:54.729> iPhone

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:55.180 
quite similar again I'd say the iPhone

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:57.449 
quite similar again I'd say the iPhone
5s<00:03:55.900> this<00:03:56.319> time<00:03:56.560> has<00:03:56.859> a<00:03:56.889> little<00:03:57.250> bit<00:03:57.310> more

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:57.459 
5s this time has a little bit more

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:00.869 
5s this time has a little bit more
contrast<00:03:57.819> then<00:03:58.509> at<00:03:58.780> the<00:03:58.959> s4<00:03:59.739> but<00:04:00.370> a<00:04:00.430> very

00:04:00.869 --> 00:04:00.879 
contrast then at the s4 but a very

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:02.729 
contrast then at the s4 but a very
similar<00:04:01.150> overall<00:04:01.569> now<00:04:02.079> moving<00:04:02.259> on<00:04:02.500> to<00:04:02.650> an

00:04:02.729 --> 00:04:02.739 
similar overall now moving on to an

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:04.229 
similar overall now moving on to an
indoor<00:04:03.040> image<00:04:03.340> in<00:04:03.549> low-light<00:04:03.970> you<00:04:04.090> can

00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:04.239 
indoor image in low-light you can

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:06.869 
indoor image in low-light you can
clearly<00:04:04.449> see<00:04:04.540> the<00:04:04.840> iPhone<00:04:05.139> 5s<00:04:05.680> is<00:04:05.949> doing<00:04:06.639> a<00:04:06.729> bad

00:04:06.869 --> 00:04:06.879 
clearly see the iPhone 5s is doing a bad

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:08.640 
clearly see the iPhone 5s is doing a bad
job<00:04:06.909> here<00:04:07.329> you've<00:04:07.449> got<00:04:07.659> a<00:04:07.810> much<00:04:08.319> brighter

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:08.650

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:13.870 
s4 now an image using the LED flashes on

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:15.809 
s4 now an image using the LED flashes on
both<00:04:14.139> of<00:04:14.290> these<00:04:14.379> devices<00:04:14.620> the<00:04:15.099> iPhone<00:04:15.400> 5s

00:04:15.809 --> 00:04:15.819 
both of these devices the iPhone 5s

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:17.610 
both of these devices the iPhone 5s
seems<00:04:16.419> to<00:04:16.539> be<00:04:16.659> a<00:04:16.690> little<00:04:17.049> more<00:04:17.139> neutral<00:04:17.320> the

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:17.620 
seems to be a little more neutral the

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:18.899 
seems to be a little more neutral the
colors<00:04:17.919> that<00:04:18.039> do<00:04:18.190> look<00:04:18.340> better<00:04:18.549> I<00:04:18.729> think

00:04:18.899 --> 00:04:18.909 
colors that do look better I think

00:04:18.909 --> 00:04:21.719 
colors that do look better I think
that's<00:04:19.090> time<00:04:19.239> 2d<00:04:19.570> dual<00:04:19.810> LED<00:04:20.229> flash<00:04:20.259> the<00:04:21.039> s4<00:04:21.549> is

00:04:21.719 --> 00:04:21.729 
that's time 2d dual LED flash the s4 is

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:23.969 
that's time 2d dual LED flash the s4 is
doing<00:04:22.330> a<00:04:22.360> pretty<00:04:22.479> standard<00:04:22.870> job<00:04:23.110> here<00:04:23.440> but<00:04:23.860> it

00:04:23.969 --> 00:04:23.979 
doing a pretty standard job here but it

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:25.620 
doing a pretty standard job here but it
is<00:04:24.099> a<00:04:24.130> little<00:04:24.430> bit<00:04:24.580> too<00:04:24.729> warm<00:04:25.029> I<00:04:25.180> think<00:04:25.419> it's<00:04:25.570> I

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:25.630 
is a little bit too warm I think it's I

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:27.840 
is a little bit too warm I think it's I
would<00:04:25.750> give<00:04:25.930> the<00:04:26.110> edge<00:04:26.289> of<00:04:26.620> the<00:04:27.010> flash<00:04:27.310> a<00:04:27.550> 2

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:27.850 
would give the edge of the flash a 2

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:29.310 
would give the edge of the flash a 2
the<00:04:27.940> iPhone<00:04:28.240> 5s<00:04:28.420> here<00:04:28.750> so<00:04:28.930> that<00:04:29.080> was<00:04:29.200> my

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:29.320 
the iPhone 5s here so that was my

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:31.230 
the iPhone 5s here so that was my
comparison<00:04:29.710> of<00:04:29.890> the<00:04:30.010> iPhone<00:04:30.340> 5s<00:04:30.640> cameras

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:31.240 
comparison of the iPhone 5s cameras

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:33.270 
comparison of the iPhone 5s cameras
versus<00:04:31.600> at<00:04:31.720> the<00:04:31.930> Samsung<00:04:32.260> Galaxy<00:04:32.350> s4<00:04:32.740> cameras

versus at the Samsung Galaxy s4 cameras

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:35.730 
versus at the Samsung Galaxy s4 cameras
overall<00:04:34.090> I<00:04:34.120> would<00:04:34.330> say<00:04:34.480> in<00:04:34.630> good<00:04:34.840> light<00:04:35.050> the<00:04:35.350> s4

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:35.740 
overall I would say in good light the s4

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:37.980 
overall I would say in good light the s4
does<00:04:36.100> perform<00:04:36.550> better<00:04:36.700> it<00:04:37.180> has<00:04:37.570> much<00:04:37.780> more

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:37.990 
does perform better it has much more

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:40.260 
does perform better it has much more
detail<00:04:38.320> on<00:04:38.500> a<00:04:38.680> much<00:04:38.950> higher<00:04:39.220> resolution<00:04:39.430> 13

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:41.970 
detail on a much higher resolution 13
megapixels<00:04:40.930> which<00:04:41.320> is<00:04:41.530> a<00:04:41.560> big<00:04:41.890> advantage

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:41.980 
megapixels which is a big advantage

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:44.400 
megapixels which is a big advantage
low-light<00:04:42.970> however<00:04:43.330> the<00:04:43.480> iPhone<00:04:43.780> 5s<00:04:44.200> does

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:44.410 
low-light however the iPhone 5s does

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:45.870 
low-light however the iPhone 5s does
seem<00:04:44.590> to<00:04:44.710> perform<00:04:44.920> better<00:04:45.220> you've<00:04:45.430> got<00:04:45.670> much

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:45.880 
seem to perform better you've got much

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:48.270 
seem to perform better you've got much
brighter<00:04:46.270> images<00:04:46.840> because<00:04:47.500> of<00:04:47.710> the<00:04:47.920> larger

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:48.280 
brighter images because of the larger

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:50.820 
brighter images because of the larger

pixels on the sensor of the iPhone 5s
front-facing<00:04:51.460> camera<00:04:51.880> I<00:04:52.060> would<00:04:52.240> give<00:04:52.420> the

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:52.570 
front-facing camera I would give the

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:54.630 
front-facing camera I would give the
edge<00:04:52.720> again<00:04:52.900> to<00:04:53.410> the<00:04:53.530> s4<00:04:53.950> because<00:04:54.220> of<00:04:54.430> that

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:54.640 
edge again to the s4 because of that

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:56.460 
edge again to the s4 because of that
high<00:04:54.850> resolution<00:04:55.090> you've<00:04:55.720> got<00:04:55.930> 1080p

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:56.470 
high resolution you've got 1080p

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:58.800 
high resolution you've got 1080p
compared<00:04:56.890> to<00:04:56.950> 720p<00:04:57.490> so<00:04:58.270> you've<00:04:58.360> got<00:04:58.540> some<00:04:58.720> more

00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:58.810 
compared to 720p so you've got some more

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:01.620 
compared to 720p so you've got some more
detail<00:04:59.230> on<00:04:59.500> the<00:04:59.860> s4<00:05:00.310> and<00:05:00.580> I<00:05:00.850> also<00:05:01.060> prefer<00:05:01.450> the

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:01.630 
detail on the s4 and I also prefer the

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:03.300 
detail on the s4 and I also prefer the
tones<00:05:01.960> on<00:05:02.290> the<00:05:02.500> s4<00:05:02.830> I<00:05:02.920> thought<00:05:03.100> they<00:05:03.220> were<00:05:03.280> a

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:03.310

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:23.800 
the s4 was much louder than at the 5s

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:25.890 
the s4 was much louder than at the 5s
and<00:05:24.190> the<00:05:24.640> sound<00:05:24.880> was<00:05:25.000> a<00:05:25.060> lot<00:05:25.300> more<00:05:25.450> rich<00:05:25.660> so<00:05:25.870> I

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:25.900 
and the sound was a lot more rich so I

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:28.350 
and the sound was a lot more rich so I
did<00:05:26.110> prefer<00:05:26.440> the<00:05:26.860> sound<00:05:27.040> on<00:05:27.340> the<00:05:27.460> s4<00:05:27.940> because

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:28.360 
did prefer the sound on the s4 because

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:30.270 
did prefer the sound on the s4 because
of<00:05:28.570> the<00:05:28.720> stereo<00:05:29.080> sound<00:05:29.260> that's<00:05:29.830> what<00:05:29.980> I<00:05:30.010> think

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:30.280 
of the stereo sound that's what I think

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:32.070 
of the stereo sound that's what I think
