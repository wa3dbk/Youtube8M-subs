00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:09.130
 here 

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:15.700
 now everyone talks to 1991 and today I 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:17.020
 I bring this mv bomb on the down map 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:19.210
 tour and as you can see I'm playing 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:20.770
 evolution that I know is a game mode 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:22.450
 that you asked me a lot because I was 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:23.560
 time that a gameplay did not come up here and 

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:25.720
 without passion a good game very 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:28.000
 representative on my channel 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:30.009
 and I charge to the first with which 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.869
 started this streak that will be 24 

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:34.110
 followed without dying and the funny thing is that 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:37.420
 I bring you we are on a map that I hate 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.920
 deeply maybe maybe you eagle maybe 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:41.290
 already directly is the map that less me 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:43.120
 like in the game but well I know this 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:44.829
 it's not a thing of mine either because 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:48.550
 general likes it almost always loses the 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:51.339
 votes and you see that quickly I 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:53.110
 I get all three of the advantages of 

00:00:51.339 --> 00:00:55.899
 specialist that I have marked already you see 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:57.820
 scavenger killer and conditioning 

00:00:55.899 --> 00:00:59.680
 very fast end 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.360
 and good thing is that what happens with 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:04.120
 This map must be recognized as a 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:06.370
 map very currado but then at the time of 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:08.229
 play things is that they do not work by 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:09.670
 at least I like nothing how to 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:11.650
 develop the games here no 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:13.300
 game mode look there are maps that in 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:14.530
 some game mode you like in another 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:16.540
 new but I do not like this one 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:19.060
 none of you tell me what is 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:20.200
 your experience playing here but 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.150
 good in my opinion it costs me 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.130
 move is a map where I see very little 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:26.110
 mobility by come by account teams 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:27.790
 a lot of people roaming the areas 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:29.650
 from the center at least from the other side is 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:31.350
 impossible to move around because you 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:34.090
 they change from all sides 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.530
 frankly I do not like but above all 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.660
 what I'm going to talk about in this gameplay is 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:40.270
 of the demolition game mode because 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:41.890
 I do not climb as much as before because I do not climb 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:44.229
 as much as the black ops which is the black 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:46.990
 ops practically every two weeks there 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:49.300
 a demolition gameplay 60% of the 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:50.590
 time I was playing demolition and at 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:52.119
 start modern warfare 3 also 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:53.350
 It plays quite demolition but not 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:55.180
 both with the black ops but also in 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:57.250
 the us was always playing mode 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:59.860
 game that I liked but the case is 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:01.210
 that there was a day that came a 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.130
 update in which they were loaded 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:04.450
 totally the modified responsos 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:06.520
 absolutely 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.560
 the reason for doing this was that there 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:11.500
 teams you already know that from good people very 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:14.379
 organized that are going to look for the responds 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.970
 I take the 6 and reach the point of taking 

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:17.920
 all the respawn points that will 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:19.750
 they know by heart and then you can not 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.650
 play because it's going out and they kill you but you 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.780
 kill 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.459
 within half a second of leaving it is clear that 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.959
 until that point you do not have to get there 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:27.760
 to do something but what can not be 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:29.470
 is what they have done that have been charged 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.750
 totally payments have been said that 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.610
 you are going to do spawn trap because nothing 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:35.769
 we change totally and when a team 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:37.989
 encloses the enclosed team to the other 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:39.280
 the other end of the map comes out and looks like a 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:42.010
 good solution but is that it is loaded 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:44.590
 Fully game mode because no 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:47.170
 can be is that the idea of ​​demolition 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:49.930
 it has always been to lock them up to be able 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:51.670
 of advancing lines the team enclosing them 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:53.530
 at its base to keep them away from the bombs 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:54.610
 if I had it is able to close or if you 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:56.349
 goes to the other end is that it has 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:58.150
 totally the meaning and more thought 

00:02:56.349 --> 00:03:00.640
 there are usually two pumps one more 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:02.980
 near and another more distant 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:05.140
 is that you imagine I had earth survived 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:06.850
 and earth suffers the next to the pump 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:09.850
 further away we go is that he loses all the 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:12.130
 sense I've seen sometimes respawn in 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:13.569
 those that I have left in the pump that 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:15.040
 have to place two meters from the 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:17.950
 pump that I had to place and equally 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:20.410
 the enemies so that is what 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:22.750
 I say they lose quite the sense because 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:24.220
 it has always been that idea then if 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:25.690
 is the problem that of paul trap 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:27.220
 will have to correct or otherwise 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:28.900
 will have to do something in the responsos 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:30.580
 but it can not be it seems very little 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.319
 professional 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:33.820
 that is to put on sale a finished game 

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:35.230
 for the good ending we have that 

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:36.760
 problem because nothing changes minor payments 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:38.050
 and period but not because the maps are 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:39.820
 made in a way the pumps are 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:41.260
 placed in one place and changes 

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:43.180
 totally the game mode and for me it 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.550
 they have loaded and for me it loses the sense 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:47.080
 this because necessary in the back I 

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:48.700
 went beyond learning values ​​we're going 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:50.830
 demolitions I almost took it you changed 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:52.720
 I'm all in one more game already 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:54.910
 step to learn these risks because 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:56.470
 fuck no, no, I see that they come out 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:58.810
 behind one day he started playing remember in 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:01.090
 vision and I left behind all the time the 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:02.680
 middle zone that of the masters of 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:08.080
 intricate software of the broadcast medium 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:09.610
 we were shrinking and freeing space 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:10.660
 I say but what is happening have become 

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:12.010
 crazy here and then I saw what the 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:13.540
 update and I did not understand a bit 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:16.180
 I understood it better I understood it 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:17.950
 understand it I share the opinion of what 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:19.690
 what he did and good since then is the 

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:22.450
 reason that the game and the truth that 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:24.660
 I do not plan to play more terrible 

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:26.580
 when from events to play 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:28.710
 in demolition and see here some games 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:30.810
 but here I have not been welcome to 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:33.120
 take the flag to search and destroy 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:36.510
 many modes in modern warfare 3 but 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:38.310
 demolition more is not comfortable or is it 

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:40.530
 as something already ethical I can not play that 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:42.060
 good game for what you have done hopefully 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:44.400
 that in the next game are capable 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:46.170
 to find the balance find the 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:48.600
 balance between maintaining the idea of 

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:50.220
 game mode but and that you can not 

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:51.360
 do the damn spawn trap they put 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:52.830
 of your response 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:55.560
 well whatever the maps do that 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:56.940
 build them well and you can play 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:59.400
 really this game mode that the 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:01.800
 I truly believe that it is very entertaining and 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:03.540
 well there is the emv kill me after 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:05.400
 less badly imagined in getting to arrive 

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:07.920
 is enemy a little earlier and I the 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:10.110
 we removed and we were miraculously the 

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:11.700
 I got and nothing, I say here, Latin, no, 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:13.590
 native I do not know if I could throw 

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:16.110
 the light with the pp I remember but I garcía the 

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:18.900
 throw and point and nothing while placing the 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:21.270
 insertion and 54 are left I say goodbye 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:24.050
 I just run out of time until other kids 

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:24.050
 boom
