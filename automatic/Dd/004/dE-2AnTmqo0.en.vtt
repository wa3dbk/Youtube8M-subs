I'll<00:00:57.469> be<00:00:57.829> doing<00:00:57.979> a<00:00:58.159> couple<00:00:59.120> of<00:00:59.269> test<00:00:59.690> shots<00:00:59.780> on

I'll be doing a couple of test shots on

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:02.979 
I'll be doing a couple of test shots on
this<00:01:00.620> tree<00:01:01.100> it's<00:01:01.399> got<00:01:01.609> lovely<00:01:02.149> good<00:01:02.420> texture

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:02.989 
this tree it's got lovely good texture

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:04.689 
this tree it's got lovely good texture
in<00:01:03.079> there<00:01:03.289> and<00:01:03.499> a<00:01:03.949> lot<00:01:04.129> of<00:01:04.250> the<00:01:04.339> tests<00:01:04.610> I've

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:04.699 
in there and a lot of the tests I've

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:08.590 
in there and a lot of the tests I've
done<00:01:04.879> so<00:01:05.059> far<00:01:05.089> at<00:01:05.630> F<00:01:05.990> 2.8<00:01:06.860> and<00:01:07.219> f/4<00:01:07.759> so<00:01:08.240> here<00:01:08.509> I'm

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:08.600 
done so far at F 2.8 and f/4 so here I'm

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.030 
done so far at F 2.8 and f/4 so here I'm
actually<00:01:08.750> going<00:01:08.960> to<00:01:09.049> test<00:01:09.229> it<00:01:09.409> at<00:01:09.500> five<00:01:09.710> point

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:10.040 
actually going to test it at five point

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:11.499 
actually going to test it at five point
six<00:01:10.310> and<00:01:10.460> eight<00:01:10.670> on<00:01:10.909> each<00:01:11.060> of<00:01:11.240> the<00:01:11.360> lenses

00:01:11.499 --> 00:01:11.509 
six and eight on each of the lenses

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:13.510 
six and eight on each of the lenses
which<00:01:12.170> should<00:01:12.439> be<00:01:12.590> around<00:01:12.710> the<00:01:13.009> optimal

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520 
which should be around the optimal

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.130 
which should be around the optimal
sharpness<00:01:14.030> now<00:01:14.450> something<00:01:14.750> you<00:01:14.780> really<00:01:15.110> need

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.140 
sharpness now something you really need

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.010 
sharpness now something you really need
to<00:01:15.350> keep<00:01:15.500> in<00:01:15.649> mind<00:01:15.890> of<00:01:16.040> course<00:01:16.100> of<00:01:16.850> course<00:01:17.020> of

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.020 
to keep in mind of course of course of

to keep in mind of course of course of
course<00:01:18.079> before<00:01:18.770> people<00:01:19.250> start<00:01:19.490> flaming<00:01:19.789> me

00:01:20.139 --> 00:01:20.149 
course before people start flaming me

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:23.139 
course before people start flaming me
the<00:01:20.689> image<00:01:21.049> quality<00:01:21.259> and<00:01:21.680> arguably<00:01:22.640> even<00:01:23.060> the

00:01:23.139 --> 00:01:23.149 
the image quality and arguably even the

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:24.789 
the image quality and arguably even the
sharpness<00:01:23.479> that's<00:01:23.840> apparent<00:01:24.289> in<00:01:24.380> an<00:01:24.469> image

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:24.799 
sharpness that's apparent in an image

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:27.310 
sharpness that's apparent in an image
has<00:01:25.369> a<00:01:25.430> lot<00:01:25.700> to<00:01:25.729> do<00:01:25.939> with<00:01:26.030> the<00:01:26.180> camera<00:01:26.570> so<00:01:26.990> here

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:27.320 
has a lot to do with the camera so here

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.469 
has a lot to do with the camera so here
I'm<00:01:27.439> using<00:01:27.469> the<00:01:27.829> 5d<00:01:28.189> mark<00:01:28.460> ii<00:01:28.610> from<00:01:28.909> Canon<00:01:29.299> and

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:29.479 
I'm using the 5d mark ii from Canon and

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:31.899 
I'm using the 5d mark ii from Canon and
the<00:01:29.659> d700<00:01:30.409> from<00:01:30.590> Nikon<00:01:30.920> both<00:01:31.430> fantastic

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:31.909 
the d700 from Nikon both fantastic

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:34.719 
the d700 from Nikon both fantastic
cameras<00:01:32.570> but<00:01:32.869> very<00:01:33.469> different<00:01:33.710> cameras<00:01:34.250> of

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:34.729 
cameras but very different cameras of

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:36.910 
cameras but very different cameras of
course<00:01:34.789> the<00:01:35.149> 5d<00:01:35.479> mark<00:01:35.719> ii<00:01:35.810> is<00:01:36.200> much<00:01:36.680> higher

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:36.920 
course the 5d mark ii is much higher

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.620 
course the 5d mark ii is much higher
resolution<00:01:37.100> so<00:01:37.759> the<00:01:37.880> hundred-percent<00:01:38.359> crops

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630 
resolution so the hundred-percent crops

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:40.029 
resolution so the hundred-percent crops
aren't<00:01:38.930> going<00:01:39.049> to<00:01:39.140> match<00:01:39.289> up<00:01:39.500> with<00:01:39.619> each<00:01:39.680> other

00:01:40.029 --> 00:01:40.039 
aren't going to match up with each other

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:42.639 
aren't going to match up with each other
but<00:01:40.729> again<00:01:41.060> it's<00:01:41.570> horses<00:01:41.960> for<00:01:42.109> courses<00:01:42.140> so

00:01:42.639 --> 00:01:42.649 
but again it's horses for courses so

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:44.440 
but again it's horses for courses so
compare<00:01:43.100> the<00:01:43.549> Tamron

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
compare the Tamron

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.090 
compare the Tamron
to<00:01:44.539> the<00:01:44.659> Canon<00:01:44.990> because<00:01:45.109> they<00:01:45.409> were<00:01:45.530> all<00:01:45.710> taken

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:46.100 
to the Canon because they were all taken

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.160 
to the Canon because they were all taken
on<00:01:46.189> the<00:01:46.310> same<00:01:46.490> body<00:01:46.700> and<00:01:46.969> compare<00:01:47.630> the<00:01:47.780> Sigma

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.170 
on the same body and compare the Sigma

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.200 
on the same body and compare the Sigma
to<00:01:48.320> the<00:01:48.350> Nikon<00:01:48.740> they<00:01:49.219> were<00:01:49.280> both<00:01:49.520> taken<00:01:49.969> on<00:01:50.090> the

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.210 
to the Nikon they were both taken on the

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:51.880 
to the Nikon they were both taken on the
same<00:01:50.390> body<00:01:50.600> as<00:01:50.810> well<00:01:51.020> so<00:01:51.439> now<00:01:51.560> I'm<00:01:51.679> going<00:01:51.799> to

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:51.890 
same body as well so now I'm going to

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.700 
same body as well so now I'm going to
take<00:01:52.070> some<00:01:52.369> test<00:01:52.670> shots<00:01:52.909> of<00:01:53.119> this<00:01:53.270> one<00:01:53.509> at<00:01:53.750> 50

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.710 
take some test shots of this one at 50

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:58.959 
take some test shots of this one at 50
mil<00:01:54.920> and<00:01:55.159> 70<00:01:55.670> mil<00:01:55.880> at<00:01:56.380> 5.6<00:01:57.380> and<00:01:57.799> f/8<00:01:58.340> on<00:01:58.579> each

mil and 70 mil at 5.6 and f/8 on each

00:01:58.969 --> 00:02:00.669 
mil and 70 mil at 5.6 and f/8 on each
lens<00:01:59.299> I'll<00:01:59.539> show<00:01:59.689> you<00:01:59.749> those<00:01:59.960> ones<00:02:00.170> first<00:02:00.439> then

00:02:00.669 --> 00:02:00.679 
lens I'll show you those ones first then

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:01.989 
lens I'll show you those ones first then
we'll<00:02:00.799> jump<00:02:00.979> into<00:02:01.249> a<00:02:01.280> selection<00:02:01.609> of<00:02:01.880> other

we'll jump into a selection of other

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:03.620 
we'll jump into a selection of other
ones

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
ones

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.960 
ones
all<00:02:04.320> right<00:02:04.560> settle<00:02:04.890> in<00:02:05.100> guys<00:02:05.310> we<00:02:05.490> got<00:02:05.640> a<00:02:05.670> bunch

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:05.970 
all right settle in guys we got a bunch

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:08.300 
all right settle in guys we got a bunch
of<00:02:06.210> full<00:02:06.540> images<00:02:06.990> here<00:02:07.409> including<00:02:07.860> crops<00:02:08.130> in

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
of full images here including crops in

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.490 
of full images here including crops in
side<00:02:08.550> by<00:02:08.580> side<00:02:08.789> so<00:02:09.390> there's<00:02:09.630> the<00:02:09.810> cannon<00:02:10.229> at

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
side by side so there's the cannon at

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.100 
side by side so there's the cannon at
5.6<00:02:11.280> and<00:02:11.760> there's<00:02:12.000> a<00:02:12.120> hundred<00:02:12.510> percent<00:02:12.600> crop

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
5.6 and there's a hundred percent crop

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.630 
5.6 and there's a hundred percent crop
on<00:02:13.290> that<00:02:13.500> there<00:02:14.400> it<00:02:14.489> is<00:02:14.610> at<00:02:14.790> f/8<00:02:15.300> and<00:02:16.100> 100%<00:02:17.100> crop

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
on that there it is at f/8 and 100% crop

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.059 
on that there it is at f/8 and 100% crop
now<00:02:18.120> I'm<00:02:18.300> flying<00:02:18.959> through<00:02:19.110> these<00:02:19.530> so<00:02:19.830> if<00:02:19.920> you

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:20.069 
now I'm flying through these so if you

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:22.880 
now I'm flying through these so if you
need<00:02:20.280> to<00:02:20.520> then<00:02:20.819> pause<00:02:21.150> there's<00:02:21.600> a<00:02:21.720> Tamron<00:02:22.230> 5/6

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
need to then pause there's a Tamron 5/6

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.040 
need to then pause there's a Tamron 5/6
and<00:02:23.190> full<00:02:24.090> crop<00:02:24.390> looking<00:02:24.810> great<00:02:25.170> the<00:02:25.860> f8

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.050 
and full crop looking great the f8

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:30.110 
and full crop looking great the f8
looking<00:02:28.050> really<00:02:28.590> crisp<00:02:28.890> and<00:02:29.100> contrasty<00:02:29.910> and

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
looking really crisp and contrasty and

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.380 
looking really crisp and contrasty and
up<00:02:30.300> close<00:02:30.540> the<00:02:30.840> quality<00:02:31.230> is<00:02:31.290> good<00:02:31.620> and<00:02:32.390> here's

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
up close the quality is good and here's

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.930 
up close the quality is good and here's
the<00:02:33.540> Nikon<00:02:33.900> at<00:02:34.110> 5.6<00:02:34.680> now<00:02:35.069> this<00:02:35.400> is<00:02:35.640> not

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
the Nikon at 5.6 now this is not

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:37.910 
the Nikon at 5.6 now this is not
directly<00:02:36.150> comparable<00:02:36.959> of<00:02:37.170> course<00:02:37.440> because

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
directly comparable of course because

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.309 
directly comparable of course because
it's<00:02:38.190> on<00:02:38.340> a<00:02:38.580> different<00:02:38.819> body<00:02:39.209> now<00:02:39.510> but<00:02:40.110> there

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:40.319 
it's on a different body now but there

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:43.430 
it's on a different body now but there
it<00:02:40.410> is<00:02:40.500> the<00:02:40.680> full<00:02:40.890> crop<00:02:41.450> there<00:02:42.450> it<00:02:42.600> is<00:02:42.720> at<00:02:42.900> f/8

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
it is the full crop there it is at f/8

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:50.960 
it is the full crop there it is at f/8
and<00:02:43.680> the<00:02:44.670> full<00:02:44.850> crop<00:02:46.850> the<00:02:47.850> Sigma<00:02:48.360> now<00:02:49.970> looking

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
and the full crop the Sigma now looking

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.300 
and the full crop the Sigma now looking
good<00:02:51.239> not<00:02:51.540> quite<00:02:51.569> as<00:02:52.019> sharp<00:02:52.290> just<00:02:53.010> let<00:02:53.190> you

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
good not quite as sharp just let you

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:54.740 
good not quite as sharp just let you
know<00:02:53.340> these<00:02:53.610> are<00:02:53.670> all<00:02:53.819> taken<00:02:54.000> in<00:02:54.269> really

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
know these are all taken in really

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.720 
know these are all taken in really
contrasting<00:02:55.470> time<00:02:55.709> of<00:02:55.890> day<00:02:56.069> there<00:02:56.400> it<00:02:56.489> is<00:02:56.580> at

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
contrasting time of day there it is at

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.900 
contrasting time of day there it is at
f/8<00:02:57.230> so<00:02:58.230> that's<00:02:58.500> why<00:02:58.769> you've<00:02:59.100> got<00:02:59.340> such<00:02:59.370> harsh

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
f/8 so that's why you've got such harsh

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:01.880 
f/8 so that's why you've got such harsh
lighting<00:03:00.420> you<00:03:00.660> can<00:03:00.720> see<00:03:00.959> the<00:03:01.110> shadows<00:03:01.500> now

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
lighting you can see the shadows now

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:05.420 
lighting you can see the shadows now
let's<00:03:02.190> see<00:03:02.400> those<00:03:02.580> Center<00:03:03.120> crops<00:03:03.480> at<00:03:03.840> 100%<00:03:04.830> one

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
let's see those Center crops at 100% one

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:12.170 
let's see those Center crops at 100% one
after<00:03:05.880> the<00:03:06.000> other<00:03:09.799> okay<00:03:10.799> and<00:03:11.070> now<00:03:11.640> let's<00:03:11.670> throw

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
after the other okay and now let's throw

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.509 
after the other okay and now let's throw
them<00:03:12.329> all<00:03:12.510> up<00:03:12.780> on<00:03:13.049> the<00:03:13.260> one<00:03:13.500> grid<00:03:13.890> this<00:03:14.130> is<00:03:14.190> the

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:14.519 
them all up on the one grid this is the

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:16.880 
them all up on the one grid this is the
very<00:03:14.790> central<00:03:15.329> strip<00:03:15.870> from<00:03:16.290> each<00:03:16.530> of<00:03:16.799> the

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
very central strip from each of the

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:19.190 
very central strip from each of the
images<00:03:17.400> now<00:03:18.060> of<00:03:18.180> course<00:03:18.390> the<00:03:18.630> ones<00:03:18.780> we<00:03:18.900> shot<00:03:19.079> on

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
images now of course the ones we shot on

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.990 
images now of course the ones we shot on
the<00:03:19.350> cannon<00:03:19.739> the<00:03:19.829> cannon<00:03:19.859> and<00:03:20.340> the<00:03:20.430> Sigma<00:03:20.790> arm

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
the cannon the cannon and the Sigma arm

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.240 
the cannon the cannon and the Sigma arm
or<00:03:21.239> a<00:03:21.510> bigger<00:03:22.170> because<00:03:22.470> it<00:03:22.799> has<00:03:22.950> more

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
or a bigger because it has more

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:24.949 
or a bigger because it has more
resolution<00:03:23.760> to<00:03:24.000> play<00:03:24.209> with<00:03:24.390> and<00:03:24.540> you<00:03:24.570> can<00:03:24.750> see

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
resolution to play with and you can see

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:27.110 
resolution to play with and you can see
more<00:03:25.200> fine<00:03:25.500> detail<00:03:25.980> due<00:03:26.430> to<00:03:26.459> that<00:03:26.760> resolution

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
more fine detail due to that resolution

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.539 
more fine detail due to that resolution
now<00:03:28.019> these<00:03:28.230> are<00:03:28.500> the<00:03:28.530> top<00:03:28.829> left-hand<00:03:29.430> corner

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:29.549 
now these are the top left-hand corner

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:32.030 
now these are the top left-hand corner
crops<00:03:30.329> which<00:03:30.900> is<00:03:31.049> quite<00:03:31.320> a<00:03:31.350> different<00:03:31.470> test

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
crops which is quite a different test

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.740 
crops which is quite a different test
and<00:03:32.280> I'm<00:03:32.370> really<00:03:32.640> surprised<00:03:33.030> to<00:03:33.269> see<00:03:33.299> there

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
and I'm really surprised to see there

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:36.410 
and I'm really surprised to see there
the<00:03:34.290> tamarin<00:03:34.799> is<00:03:34.950> actually<00:03:35.430> sharper<00:03:36.030> than<00:03:36.269> the

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
the tamarin is actually sharper than the

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:39.710 
the tamarin is actually sharper than the
Canon<00:03:36.810> that's<00:03:36.930> for<00:03:37.170> sure<00:03:37.440> and<00:03:38.030> the<00:03:39.030> Sigma<00:03:39.690> is

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
Canon that's for sure and the Sigma is

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:41.690 
Canon that's for sure and the Sigma is
also<00:03:40.200> looking<00:03:40.350> pretty<00:03:40.739> great<00:03:40.980> in<00:03:41.130> the<00:03:41.280> corners

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700 
also looking pretty great in the corners

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:45.229 
also looking pretty great in the corners
really<00:03:42.540> good<00:03:42.840> result<00:03:43.579> now<00:03:44.579> let's<00:03:44.880> take<00:03:45.060> a<00:03:45.090> look

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:45.239 
really good result now let's take a look

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:46.789 
really good result now let's take a look
at<00:03:45.359> some<00:03:45.480> of<00:03:45.570> the<00:03:45.630> earlier<00:03:46.019> shots<00:03:46.260> there's<00:03:46.560> the

00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:46.799 
at some of the earlier shots there's the

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:49.910 
at some of the earlier shots there's the
cannon<00:03:47.340> at<00:03:47.549> 2.8<00:03:48.450> and<00:03:48.690> the<00:03:48.780> full<00:03:49.019> crop<00:03:49.320> centre

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 
cannon at 2.8 and the full crop centre

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:53.990 
cannon at 2.8 and the full crop centre
the<00:03:50.910> Tamron<00:03:51.480> at<00:03:51.720> 2<00:03:52.049> 8<00:03:52.230> and<00:03:52.560> the<00:03:53.430> center<00:03:53.760> full

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
the Tamron at 2 8 and the center full

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.050 
the Tamron at 2 8 and the center full
crop

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:56.060 
crop

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:59.780 
crop
next<00:03:57.060> up<00:03:57.180> is<00:03:57.450> the<00:03:57.720> Nikon<00:03:58.349> and<00:03:58.680> again<00:03:59.250> full<00:03:59.550> crop

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
next up is the Nikon and again full crop

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:01.400 
next up is the Nikon and again full crop
and<00:04:00.060> when<00:04:00.300> you<00:04:00.390> see<00:04:00.569> these<00:04:00.720> one<00:04:00.989> after<00:04:01.290> the

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.410 
and when you see these one after the

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:03.170 
and when you see these one after the
other<00:04:01.440> it's<00:04:02.129> really<00:04:02.550> interesting<00:04:03.030> to<00:04:03.150> see

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
other it's really interesting to see

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.390 
other it's really interesting to see
there's<00:04:03.690> a<00:04:03.780> Sigma<00:04:04.260> how<00:04:04.739> they<00:04:04.950> render<00:04:05.310> the

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
there's a Sigma how they render the

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.880 
there's a Sigma how they render the
bokeh<00:04:05.640> differently<00:04:06.420> at<00:04:06.690> the<00:04:07.050> full<00:04:07.260> crop<00:04:07.560> so

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:07.890 
bokeh differently at the full crop so

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:09.770 
bokeh differently at the full crop so
let's<00:04:08.069> look<00:04:08.190> at<00:04:08.340> the<00:04:08.430> one<00:04:08.640> by<00:04:08.819> one<00:04:09.120> so<00:04:09.629> the

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
let's look at the one by one so the

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:12.920 
let's look at the one by one so the
canons<00:04:10.200> just<00:04:10.410> all<00:04:10.620> creamy<00:04:11.250> the<00:04:12.120> Tamron<00:04:12.660> can

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930 
canons just all creamy the Tamron can

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:14.900 
canons just all creamy the Tamron can
you<00:04:13.019> see<00:04:13.200> the<00:04:13.380> little<00:04:13.590> concentric<00:04:14.400> circles

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:14.910 
you see the little concentric circles

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:15.320 
you see the little concentric circles
there

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:15.330 
there

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:17.990 
there
the<00:04:15.810> Nikon<00:04:16.290> is<00:04:16.530> quite<00:04:16.919> creamy<00:04:17.250> as<00:04:17.459> well<00:04:17.669> and

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
the Nikon is quite creamy as well and

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.060 
the Nikon is quite creamy as well and
the<00:04:18.450> Sigma<00:04:18.870> has<00:04:19.200> a<00:04:19.229> little<00:04:19.620> bit<00:04:19.769> of<00:04:19.859> ring

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
the Sigma has a little bit of ring

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:22.730 
the Sigma has a little bit of ring
action<00:04:20.459> on<00:04:20.549> the<00:04:20.700> inside<00:04:21.090> now<00:04:21.660> again<00:04:22.109> at<00:04:22.380> to

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 
action on the inside now again at to

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:25.850 
action on the inside now again at to
eight<00:04:22.919> there's<00:04:23.220> the<00:04:23.460> Canon<00:04:23.880> and<00:04:24.620> crisp

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
eight there's the Canon and crisp

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:30.640 
eight there's the Canon and crisp
that's<00:04:26.160> a<00:04:26.370> center<00:04:26.669> crop<00:04:26.940> Tamron<00:04:28.850> let's<00:04:29.850> also

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:30.650 
that's a center crop Tamron let's also

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:33.680 
that's a center crop Tamron let's also
fantastically<00:04:31.650> sharp<00:04:31.979> for<00:04:32.250> F<00:04:32.400> 2.8<00:04:33.120> I'm<00:04:33.300> really

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:33.690 
fantastically sharp for F 2.8 I'm really

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:36.770 
fantastically sharp for F 2.8 I'm really
impressed<00:04:33.930> the<00:04:34.290> Nick<00:04:34.830> on<00:04:35.479> again<00:04:36.479> very<00:04:36.750> good

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:36.780 
impressed the Nick on again very good

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:38.659 
impressed the Nick on again very good
but<00:04:37.200> not<00:04:37.470> as<00:04:37.620> close<00:04:37.860> up<00:04:38.040> to<00:04:38.190> see<00:04:38.340> the<00:04:38.460> fine

00:04:38.659 --> 00:04:38.669 
but not as close up to see the fine

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:39.950 
but not as close up to see the fine
detail<00:04:38.700> because<00:04:39.240> it's<00:04:39.450> a<00:04:39.540> much<00:04:39.720> lower

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:39.960 
detail because it's a much lower

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.490 
detail because it's a much lower
resolution<00:04:40.169> and<00:04:40.860> there<00:04:41.550> we<00:04:41.669> go<00:04:41.790> the<00:04:42.000> Sigma

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:42.500 
resolution and there we go the Sigma

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:45.469 
resolution and there we go the Sigma
again<00:04:43.500> looking<00:04:44.160> reasonably<00:04:44.940> good<00:04:45.180> but<00:04:45.389> you

00:04:45.469 --> 00:04:45.479 
again looking reasonably good but you

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:46.879 
again looking reasonably good but you
need<00:04:45.600> to<00:04:45.720> see<00:04:45.870> them<00:04:46.020> one<00:04:46.200> after<00:04:46.380> the<00:04:46.650> other<00:04:46.680> so

00:04:46.879 --> 00:04:46.889 
need to see them one after the other so

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:47.480 
need to see them one after the other so
here<00:04:47.220> we<00:04:47.310> are

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:47.490 
here we are

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:55.440 
here we are
Canon<00:04:47.970> Tamron<00:04:48.950> next<00:04:49.950> up<00:04:50.130> the<00:04:50.430> Nikon<00:04:52.700> Sigma

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:55.450 
Canon Tamron next up the Nikon Sigma

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:57.690 
Canon Tamron next up the Nikon Sigma
okay<00:04:56.260> and<00:04:56.530> again<00:04:56.740> let's<00:04:57.130> just<00:04:57.340> run<00:04:57.490> through

00:04:57.690 --> 00:04:57.700 
okay and again let's just run through

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:59.910 
okay and again let's just run through
the<00:04:57.790> one<00:04:57.970> more<00:04:58.120> time<00:04:58.180> so<00:04:59.020> all<00:04:59.290> of<00:04:59.740> these<00:04:59.860> are

00:04:59.910 --> 00:04:59.920 
the one more time so all of these are

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:02.070 
the one more time so all of these are
performing<00:05:00.520> really<00:05:00.820> well<00:05:01.060> and<00:05:01.390> I<00:05:01.810> think<00:05:01.840> it's

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:02.080 
performing really well and I think it's

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:04.260 
performing really well and I think it's
fair<00:05:02.260> to<00:05:02.440> say<00:05:02.470> different<00:05:03.370> ones<00:05:03.550> do<00:05:03.850> perform

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:04.270 
fair to say different ones do perform

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:07.460 
fair to say different ones do perform
differently<00:05:04.750> at<00:05:05.080> the<00:05:05.440> different<00:05:05.800> apertures

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:07.470 
differently at the different apertures

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:09.510 
differently at the different apertures
well<00:05:08.470> I'm<00:05:08.770> going<00:05:08.980> to<00:05:09.010> throw<00:05:09.220> up<00:05:09.250> a<00:05:09.400> little

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:09.520 
well I'm going to throw up a little

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:11.760 
well I'm going to throw up a little
side-by-side<00:05:10.360> in<00:05:10.600> a<00:05:10.690> second<00:05:11.110> here<00:05:11.350> that<00:05:11.530> shows

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:11.770 
side-by-side in a second here that shows

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:13.440 
side-by-side in a second here that shows
you<00:05:11.800> all<00:05:12.250> of<00:05:12.310> them<00:05:12.760> there<00:05:12.940> we<00:05:13.060> go

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:13.450 
you all of them there we go

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:17.250 
you all of them there we go
now<00:05:14.520> obviously<00:05:15.520> the<00:05:16.210> cannon<00:05:16.570> and<00:05:16.690> Tamron<00:05:17.110> are

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:17.260 
now obviously the cannon and Tamron are

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.020 
now obviously the cannon and Tamron are
the<00:05:17.320> ones<00:05:17.530> that<00:05:17.740> are<00:05:17.860> directly<00:05:18.220> comparable<00:05:18.760> to

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:19.030 
the ones that are directly comparable to

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:21.330 
the ones that are directly comparable to
each<00:05:19.060> other<00:05:19.450> and<00:05:19.750> I<00:05:20.230> have<00:05:20.410> to<00:05:20.590> say<00:05:20.800> looking<00:05:21.280> at

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:21.340 
each other and I have to say looking at

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:23.160 
each other and I have to say looking at
the<00:05:21.460> words<00:05:21.670> Nick<00:05:22.060> or<00:05:22.240> around<00:05:22.540> the<00:05:22.690> lens<00:05:22.870> I

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:23.170 
the words Nick or around the lens I

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:25.500 
the words Nick or around the lens I
think<00:05:23.410> the<00:05:23.530> Tamron<00:05:24.010> is<00:05:24.130> sharp<00:05:24.460> at<00:05:24.760> 2:08<00:05:25.270> than

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:25.510 
think the Tamron is sharp at 2:08 than

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:28.470 
think the Tamron is sharp at 2:08 than
the<00:05:25.600> Canon<00:05:26.080> but<00:05:26.740> when<00:05:26.950> you<00:05:27.070> stop<00:05:27.370> it<00:05:27.520> down<00:05:27.760> the

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:28.480 
the Canon but when you stop it down the

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:31.230 
the Canon but when you stop it down the
Canon<00:05:28.900> is<00:05:29.020> sharper<00:05:29.590> and<00:05:29.770> likewise<00:05:30.580> the<00:05:30.820> Nikon

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:31.240 
Canon is sharper and likewise the Nikon

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:33.870 
Canon is sharper and likewise the Nikon
is<00:05:31.270> a<00:05:31.510> bit<00:05:31.780> softer<00:05:32.350> 2.8<00:05:33.040> I<00:05:33.070> have<00:05:33.310> to<00:05:33.490> admit<00:05:33.700> it

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:33.880 
is a bit softer 2.8 I have to admit it

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:37.320 
is a bit softer 2.8 I have to admit it
at<00:05:34.000> f56<00:05:34.540> and<00:05:35.080> f/8<00:05:35.410> it's<00:05:35.710> great<00:05:36.550> and<00:05:36.820> clearly
