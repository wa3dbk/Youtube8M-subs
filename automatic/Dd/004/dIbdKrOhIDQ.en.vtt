somebody<00:03:36.350> who's<00:03:36.560> under<00:03:36.890> attack<00:03:37.220> buck<00:03:37.550> it<00:03:37.700> also

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:37.880 
somebody who's under attack buck it also

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:39.640 
somebody who's under attack buck it also
protects<00:03:38.420> his<00:03:38.600> team<00:03:38.810> but<00:03:39.050> he<00:03:39.110> does<00:03:39.290> it<00:03:39.440> in<00:03:39.530> an

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:39.650 
protects his team but he does it in an

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:41.470 
protects his team but he does it in an
offensive<00:03:40.190> way<00:03:40.400> so<00:03:40.850> it's<00:03:41.030> kind<00:03:41.210> of<00:03:41.300> cool

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:41.480 
offensive way so it's kind of cool

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:43.450 
offensive way so it's kind of cool
because<00:03:41.510> that's<00:03:42.440> what<00:03:42.650> supports<00:03:43.040> supposed<00:03:43.310> to

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:43.460 
because that's what supports supposed to

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:45.280 
because that's what supports supposed to
do<00:03:43.610> find<00:03:43.880> ways<00:03:44.060> to<00:03:44.090> protect<00:03:44.360> the<00:03:44.660> team<00:03:44.810> but

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:45.290 
do find ways to protect the team but

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:46.390 
do find ways to protect the team but
they're<00:03:45.410> doing<00:03:45.530> it<00:03:45.770> in<00:03:45.860> completely<00:03:46.250> different

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.400 
they're doing it in completely different

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.840 
they're doing it in completely different
ways

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:48.850 

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:58.220 

apparently<00:03:49.850> I'm<00:03:50.210> pretty<00:03:50.510> good<00:03:50.720> at<00:03:50.780> this

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.230 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:01.699 

the<00:03:59.129> dam<00:03:59.370> is<00:03:59.730> a<00:04:00.030> new<00:04:00.300> map<00:04:00.780> that<00:04:01.140> we're<00:04:01.379> showing

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:01.709 
the dam is a new map that we're showing

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:04.250 
the dam is a new map that we're showing
people<00:04:01.920> the<00:04:02.879> dam<00:04:03.120> is<00:04:03.360> a<00:04:03.720> desert<00:04:04.050> environment

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
people the dam is a desert environment

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.290 
people the dam is a desert environment
so<00:04:04.830> there<00:04:05.250> are<00:04:05.340> a<00:04:05.400> lot<00:04:05.519> of<00:04:05.550> caves<00:04:05.879> a<00:04:06.120> lot<00:04:06.209> of

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:06.300 
so there are a lot of caves a lot of

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:07.790 
so there are a lot of caves a lot of
twisting<00:04:06.660> caves<00:04:06.930> it's<00:04:07.440> a<00:04:07.470> little<00:04:07.680> more

twisting caves it's a little more

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:09.229 
twisting caves it's a little more
vertical<00:04:08.250> and<00:04:08.430> the<00:04:08.489> other<00:04:08.519> maps<00:04:08.849> we've<00:04:09.030> shown

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:09.239 
vertical and the other maps we've shown

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:11.089 
vertical and the other maps we've shown
and<00:04:09.450> there's<00:04:09.690> also<00:04:09.780> a<00:04:09.900> lot<00:04:10.110> of<00:04:10.140> very<00:04:10.440> tight<00:04:10.830> and
