00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:04.090 

let's<00:00:02.010> take<00:00:02.370> a<00:00:02.399> look<00:00:02.760> at<00:00:02.939> something<00:00:03.540> called

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:04.100 
let's take a look at something called

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:07.730 
let's take a look at something called
allosteric<00:00:05.100> enzyme<00:00:05.850> inhibition<00:00:06.450> or<00:00:06.990> Alistar

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740 
allosteric enzyme inhibition or Alistar

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.290 
allosteric enzyme inhibition or Alistar
but<00:00:08.099> I'm<00:00:08.189> going<00:00:08.309> to<00:00:08.340> start<00:00:08.490> with<00:00:08.639> a<00:00:08.670> silly

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
but I'm going to start with a silly

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.299 
but I'm going to start with a silly
analogy<00:00:09.570> here<00:00:10.080> I'm<00:00:10.860> gonna<00:00:10.980> pretend<00:00:11.250> like

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
analogy here I'm gonna pretend like

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.209 
analogy here I'm gonna pretend like
we're<00:00:11.550> in<00:00:11.580> an<00:00:11.790> M&amp;M<00:00:12.269> factory<00:00:12.300> here<00:00:13.139> and<00:00:13.290> these

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
we're in an M&amp;M factory here and these

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.140 
we're in an M&amp;M factory here and these
are<00:00:14.280> the<00:00:14.730> various<00:00:15.059> workers<00:00:15.690> and<00:00:16.430> they<00:00:17.430> work<00:00:17.940> in

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
are the various workers and they work in

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.540 
are the various workers and they work in
a<00:00:18.330> chain<00:00:19.230> basically<00:00:19.800> so<00:00:19.949> the<00:00:20.039> chocolate<00:00:20.189> bar

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
a chain basically so the chocolate bar

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.370 
a chain basically so the chocolate bar
has<00:00:20.789> to<00:00:20.820> be<00:00:20.970> shaped<00:00:21.330> into<00:00:21.570> little<00:00:21.869> ovals<00:00:22.199> the

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
has to be shaped into little ovals the

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.019 
has to be shaped into little ovals the
ovals<00:00:22.650> have<00:00:22.800> to<00:00:22.890> have<00:00:23.010> a<00:00:23.039> nut<00:00:23.279> added<00:00:23.670> inside

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
ovals have to have a nut added inside

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.570 
ovals have to have a nut added inside
and<00:00:24.359> then<00:00:24.510> this<00:00:24.810> guy<00:00:25.109> is<00:00:25.170> going<00:00:25.619> to<00:00:25.890> put<00:00:26.550> a

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
and then this guy is going to put a

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.759 
and then this guy is going to put a
candy<00:00:26.939> shell<00:00:27.090> on<00:00:27.240> the<00:00:27.330> outside<00:00:27.359> and<00:00:27.960> then<00:00:28.500> this

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
candy shell on the outside and then this

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.950 
candy shell on the outside and then this
one<00:00:29.039> does<00:00:29.310> all<00:00:29.519> the<00:00:29.730> you<00:00:30.090> know<00:00:30.119> stacking

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
one does all the you know stacking

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.410 
one does all the you know stacking
piling<00:00:31.529> up<00:00:31.679> or<00:00:31.830> something<00:00:32.099> like<00:00:32.219> that<00:00:32.279> so<00:00:33.059> this

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
piling up or something like that so this

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.819 
piling up or something like that so this
is<00:00:33.570> an<00:00:33.690> example<00:00:33.989> of<00:00:34.290> a<00:00:35.059> chain<00:00:36.059> a<00:00:36.829> production

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
is an example of a chain a production

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.440 
is an example of a chain a production
chain<00:00:38.129> and<00:00:38.340> each<00:00:38.790> one<00:00:39.030> of<00:00:39.059> these<00:00:39.239> guys

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
chain and each one of these guys

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.490 
chain and each one of these guys
represents<00:00:40.640> one<00:00:41.640> particular<00:00:42.480> tool<00:00:42.780> in<00:00:43.079> the

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
represents one particular tool in the

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.470 
represents one particular tool in the
process<00:00:43.920> here<00:00:44.129> now<00:00:44.640> in<00:00:44.850> the<00:00:44.969> production<00:00:45.300> of

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
process here now in the production of

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.170 
process here now in the production of
M&amp;Ms<00:00:46.440> let's<00:00:46.829> see<00:00:47.100> let's<00:00:47.399> say<00:00:47.579> everything<00:00:48.030> is

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
M&amp;Ms let's see let's say everything is

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.970 
M&amp;Ms let's see let's say everything is
going<00:00:48.420> really<00:00:48.600> well<00:00:48.750> and<00:00:49.200> we've<00:00:49.440> get<00:00:49.680> we're

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
going really well and we've get we're

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.279 
going really well and we've get we're
getting<00:00:50.280> like<00:00:50.460> tons<00:00:51.120> of<00:00:51.239> these<00:00:51.300> M&amp;Ms<00:00:51.840> here<00:00:52.050> let

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
getting like tons of these M&amp;Ms here let

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.220 
getting like tons of these M&amp;Ms here let
me<00:00:52.440> add<00:00:53.070> a<00:00:53.610> few<00:00:53.789> more<00:00:54.000> and<00:00:54.390> we've<00:00:54.960> gotten<00:00:55.170> to

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
me add a few more and we've gotten to

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.779 
me add a few more and we've gotten to
the<00:00:55.320> point<00:00:55.350> where<00:00:55.680> there's<00:00:56.370> just<00:00:56.430> too<00:00:56.670> many

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
the point where there's just too many

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.450 
the point where there's just too many
M&amp;Ms<00:00:57.239> piling<00:00:57.690> up<00:00:57.840> we<00:00:58.140> don't<00:00:58.289> need<00:00:58.649> we<00:00:58.980> can't

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
M&amp;Ms piling up we don't need we can't

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:00.889 
M&amp;Ms piling up we don't need we can't
ship<00:00:59.670> them<00:00:59.850> off<00:00:59.969> fast<00:01:00.239> enough<00:01:00.329> people<00:01:00.570> are<00:01:00.780> not

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
ship them off fast enough people are not

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.229 
ship them off fast enough people are not
buying<00:01:01.199> M&amp;Ms<00:01:01.710> as<00:01:01.890> fast<00:01:02.489> as<00:01:02.670> we<00:01:02.789> want<00:01:02.969> them<00:01:03.180> to

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
buying M&amp;Ms as fast as we want them to

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.149 
buying M&amp;Ms as fast as we want them to
and<00:01:03.660> we<00:01:03.930> just<00:01:04.110> have<00:01:04.229> a<00:01:04.260> ridiculous<00:01:04.739> number<00:01:04.890> of

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
and we just have a ridiculous number of

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.340 
and we just have a ridiculous number of
mm<00:01:05.519> so<00:01:05.640> we<00:01:05.729> have<00:01:05.850> to<00:01:05.939> stop<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.360> whole<00:01:06.510> thing<00:01:06.540> so

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
mm so we have to stop the whole thing so

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.350 
mm so we have to stop the whole thing so
if<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.590> stupid<00:01:07.950> example<00:01:08.220> here<00:01:08.580> is<00:01:08.729> that<00:01:09.180> in

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
if the stupid example here is that in

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.649 
if the stupid example here is that in
the<00:01:09.450> end<00:01:10.220> these<00:01:11.220> m'aimes<00:01:11.670> pas<00:01:11.909> up<00:01:12.210> so<00:01:12.450> much

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
where's my infinite one I can't find her

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.359 
where's my infinite one I can't find her
anymore<00:01:14.970> anyways<00:01:15.420> these<00:01:15.869> N<00:01:16.080> M&amp;Ms<00:01:16.650> pile<00:01:16.950> up<00:01:17.159> so

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
anymore anyways these N M&amp;Ms pile up so

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:18.859 
anymore anyways these N M&amp;Ms pile up so
much<00:01:17.549> that<00:01:17.610> somebody<00:01:18.299> in<00:01:18.420> the<00:01:18.509> end<00:01:18.659> here<00:01:18.840> just

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.260 
that's a good thing because we have too
many<00:01:42.869> of<00:01:43.110> these<00:01:43.200> M&amp;Ms<00:01:43.710> and<00:01:43.950> then<00:01:44.460> as<00:01:44.670> these<00:01:44.909> get

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
many of these M&amp;Ms and then as these get

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.899 
many of these M&amp;Ms and then as these get
shipped<00:01:45.990> off<00:01:46.170> as<00:01:46.770> these<00:01:47.070> things<00:01:47.340> get<00:01:47.579> shipped

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
shipped off as these things get shipped

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:51.039 
shipped off as these things get shipped
off<00:01:48.060> and<00:01:48.360> we<00:01:48.869> have<00:01:49.049> less<00:01:49.320> and<00:01:49.560> less<00:01:49.619> of<00:01:50.399> them

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:51.049 
off and we have less and less of them

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:53.810 
off and we have less and less of them
then<00:01:52.049> you<00:01:52.799> know<00:01:53.159> we<00:01:53.340> eventually<00:01:53.670> have<00:01:53.790> to

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
then you know we eventually have to

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.940 
then you know we eventually have to
shift<00:01:54.119> these<00:01:54.329> ones<00:01:54.600> off<00:01:54.810> as<00:01:55.049> well<00:01:55.259> to<00:01:55.500> or<00:01:55.799> maybe

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
shift these ones off as well to or maybe

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:56.990 
shift these ones off as well to or maybe
he<00:01:56.040> doesn't<00:01:56.100> get<00:01:56.310> knocked<00:01:56.399> out<00:01:56.610> he<00:01:56.700> just<00:01:56.729> eats

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
he doesn't get knocked out he just eats

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.609 
he doesn't get knocked out he just eats
too<00:01:57.210> many<00:01:57.390> and<00:01:57.540> falls<00:01:57.750> asleep<00:01:57.869> or<00:01:58.320> something

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
too many and falls asleep or something

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.139 
too many and falls asleep or something
like<00:01:58.740> that<00:01:58.799> but<00:01:59.369> eventually<00:01:59.520> those<00:01:59.969> get

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
like that but eventually those get

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.149 
like that but eventually those get
shipped<00:02:00.390> off<00:02:00.540> as<00:02:00.750> well<00:02:00.960> and<00:02:01.200> then<00:02:01.890> there's

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
shipped off as well and then there's

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:03.499 
shipped off as well and then there's
nothing<00:02:02.340> kind<00:02:02.670> of<00:02:02.850> stopping<00:02:03.180> him<00:02:03.270> anymore

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
nothing kind of stopping him anymore

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.420 
nothing kind of stopping him anymore
because<00:02:03.810> there's<00:02:04.079> no<00:02:04.200> more<00:02:04.439> constant

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
because there's no more constant

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.069 
because there's no more constant
bombardment<00:02:05.640> of<00:02:06.119> M&amp;Ms<00:02:06.479> trying<00:02:06.719> to<00:02:06.780> knock<00:02:06.899> him

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
bombardment of M&amp;Ms trying to knock him

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:08.869 
bombardment of M&amp;Ms trying to knock him
out<00:02:07.200> and<00:02:07.409> he<00:02:07.500> comes<00:02:07.740> back<00:02:07.860> and<00:02:08.160> it<00:02:08.550> makes<00:02:08.729> sense

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
out and he comes back and it makes sense

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:10.820 
out and he comes back and it makes sense
now<00:02:09.119> because<00:02:09.780> now<00:02:10.050> he<00:02:10.110> can<00:02:10.259> shape<00:02:10.619> these

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
now because now he can shape these

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.380 
now because now he can shape these
chocolate<00:02:11.190> bars<00:02:11.220> and<00:02:11.459> the<00:02:11.610> ovals<00:02:11.970> add<00:02:12.150> some

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
chocolate bars and the ovals add some

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.900 
chocolate bars and the ovals add some
nuts

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
nuts

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:14.940 
nuts
at<00:02:13.360> the<00:02:13.480> candy<00:02:13.750> show<00:02:13.960> and<00:02:14.200> then<00:02:14.620> we<00:02:14.710> start

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
at the candy show and then we start

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.080 
at the candy show and then we start
producing<00:02:15.630> more<00:02:16.630> and<00:02:16.900> more<00:02:17.500> of<00:02:17.740> these<00:02:18.130> as<00:02:18.430> we

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
producing more and more of these as we

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:22.230 
producing more and more of these as we
are<00:02:19.150> supposed<00:02:19.570> to<00:02:19.660> have<00:02:20.790> so<00:02:21.790> that's<00:02:21.970> a<00:02:22.090> good

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:22.240 
are supposed to have so that's a good

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:24.240 
are supposed to have so that's a good
thing<00:02:22.300> what<00:02:23.290> have<00:02:23.380> I<00:02:23.470> just<00:02:23.500> done<00:02:23.770> here<00:02:24.100> I'm

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
thing what have I just done here I'm

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:25.800 
thing what have I just done here I'm
using<00:02:24.490> this<00:02:24.670> as<00:02:24.850> an<00:02:24.940> analogy<00:02:25.330> to<00:02:25.450> show<00:02:25.750> you

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
using this as an analogy to show you

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.720 
using this as an analogy to show you
that<00:02:26.370> these<00:02:27.370> could<00:02:27.940> be<00:02:27.970> enzymes<00:02:28.660> in<00:02:28.990> a<00:02:29.110> pathway

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
that these could be enzymes in a pathway

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.480 
that these could be enzymes in a pathway
this<00:02:30.730> is<00:02:30.940> the<00:02:31.090> initial<00:02:31.770> substrate<00:02:32.770> that<00:02:33.280> gets

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:33.490 
this is the initial substrate that gets

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:35.370 
this is the initial substrate that gets
worked<00:02:33.940> on<00:02:34.150> by<00:02:34.330> this<00:02:34.390> enzyme<00:02:34.690> it's<00:02:35.080> turning

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 
worked on by this enzyme it's turning

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:36.990 
worked on by this enzyme it's turning
this<00:02:35.620> thing<00:02:35.680> this<00:02:36.160> thing<00:02:36.220> gets<00:02:36.580> worked<00:02:36.760> on<00:02:36.880> by

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
this thing this thing gets worked on by

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.790 
this thing this thing gets worked on by
this<00:02:37.060> enzyme<00:02:37.390> and<00:02:37.810> so<00:02:38.020> on<00:02:38.140> and<00:02:38.290> so<00:02:38.410> forth<00:02:38.650> and

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:38.800 
this enzyme and so on and so forth and

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.880 
this enzyme and so on and so forth and
we<00:02:38.860> end<00:02:39.010> up<00:02:39.070> with<00:02:39.220> a<00:02:39.250> final<00:02:39.640> product<00:02:40.060> here<00:02:40.510> and

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
we end up with a final product here and

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.500 
we end up with a final product here and
the<00:02:41.890> final<00:02:42.280> product<00:02:42.730> if<00:02:42.880> there's<00:02:43.030> too<00:02:43.270> much<00:02:43.450> of

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
the final product if there's too much of

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:46.350 
the final product if there's too much of
it<00:02:43.830> the<00:02:44.830> final<00:02:45.220> product<00:02:45.580> can<00:02:45.760> come<00:02:45.940> back<00:02:46.090> in

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
it the final product can come back in

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.380 
it the final product can come back in
inhibit<00:02:47.260> this<00:02:47.800> first<00:02:48.220> enzyme<00:02:48.730> and<00:02:49.000> if<00:02:49.300> it

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.390 
inhibit this first enzyme and if it

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:51.870 
inhibit this first enzyme and if it
inhibits<00:02:49.840> this<00:02:49.990> first<00:02:50.260> enzyme<00:02:50.740> then<00:02:51.370> the

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:51.880 
inhibits this first enzyme then the

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.510 
inhibits this first enzyme then the
whole<00:02:52.150> production<00:02:52.810> line<00:02:53.290> shuts<00:02:53.590> down<00:02:53.830> and<00:02:54.130> it

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:54.520 
whole production line shuts down and it

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:56.250 
whole production line shuts down and it
works<00:02:54.760> as<00:02:55.060> a<00:02:55.090> kind<00:02:55.420> of<00:02:55.570> negative<00:02:55.990> feedback

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
works as a kind of negative feedback

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.140 
works as a kind of negative feedback
mechanism<00:02:57.130> when<00:02:57.280> there's<00:02:57.430> too<00:02:57.640> much<00:02:57.670> of<00:02:57.880> the

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
mechanism when there's too much of the

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.510 
mechanism when there's too much of the
product<00:02:58.390> the<00:02:59.200> product<00:02:59.500> itself<00:02:59.980> can<00:03:00.310> actually

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:00.520 
product the product itself can actually

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:02.520 
product the product itself can actually
inhibit<00:03:01.330> this<00:03:01.540> enzyme<00:03:01.600> and<00:03:02.140> slow<00:03:02.320> down

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
inhibit this enzyme and slow down

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:04.650 
inhibit this enzyme and slow down
everything<00:03:03.010> when<00:03:03.820> we<00:03:03.910> don't<00:03:04.120> need<00:03:04.300> too<00:03:04.510> much

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:04.660 
everything when we don't need too much

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:06.300 
everything when we don't need too much
of<00:03:04.840> this<00:03:04.930> and<00:03:05.140> then<00:03:05.590> when<00:03:05.740> there's<00:03:05.890> not<00:03:06.010> enough

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
of this and then when there's not enough

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:07.110 
of this and then when there's not enough
of<00:03:06.490> the<00:03:06.610> product

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
of the product

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.060 
of the product
well<00:03:07.270> this<00:03:07.720> stops<00:03:08.020> inhibiting<00:03:08.680> this<00:03:08.830> first

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:09.070 
well this stops inhibiting this first

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:12.120 
well this stops inhibiting this first
enzyme<00:03:09.490> and<00:03:09.780> everything<00:03:10.780> can<00:03:10.990> go<00:03:11.140> back<00:03:11.170> to

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:12.130 
enzyme and everything can go back to

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:15.450 
enzyme and everything can go back to
working<00:03:12.520> normally<00:03:13.090> so<00:03:14.020> we<00:03:14.140> only<00:03:14.350> have<00:03:14.710> to<00:03:14.860> mess

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:15.460 
working normally so we only have to mess

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:18.420 
working normally so we only have to mess
with<00:03:15.730> this<00:03:16.270> first<00:03:16.660> guy<00:03:16.900> mess<00:03:17.770> with<00:03:17.950> this<00:03:18.070> first

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:18.430 
with this first guy mess with this first

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:22.410 
with this first guy mess with this first
actual<00:03:19.120> enzyme<00:03:19.570> here<00:03:19.840> so<00:03:20.080> in<00:03:20.380> reality<00:03:21.420> many

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420 
actual enzyme here so in reality many

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:24.930 
actual enzyme here so in reality many
metabolic<00:03:23.230> pathways<00:03:23.709> can<00:03:23.980> be<00:03:24.100> chains<00:03:24.459> that

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 
metabolic pathways can be chains that

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:27.030 
metabolic pathways can be chains that
can<00:03:25.090> be<00:03:25.209> cycles<00:03:25.810> like<00:03:25.990> glycolysis<00:03:26.650> or<00:03:26.920> the

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.040 
can be cycles like glycolysis or the

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.000 
can be cycles like glycolysis or the
krebs<00:03:27.310> cycle<00:03:27.900> this<00:03:28.900> is<00:03:29.080> normal<00:03:29.530> in<00:03:29.680> biology

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010 
krebs cycle this is normal in biology

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:32.910 
krebs cycle this is normal in biology
and<00:03:30.580> each<00:03:30.940> of<00:03:31.300> these<00:03:31.480> steps<00:03:31.870> in<00:03:32.140> the<00:03:32.320> chain<00:03:32.620> is

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:32.920 
and each of these steps in the chain is

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.820 
and each of these steps in the chain is
worked<00:03:33.190> on<00:03:33.430> by<00:03:33.670> one<00:03:33.970> enzyme<00:03:34.900> starting<00:03:35.709> with

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:35.830 
worked on by one enzyme starting with

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:39.000 
worked on by one enzyme starting with
one<00:03:36.040> step<00:03:36.340> substrate<00:03:36.970> which<00:03:37.500> turns<00:03:38.500> it<00:03:38.709> into<00:03:38.830> a

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010 
one step substrate which turns it into a

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:40.710 
one step substrate which turns it into a
product<00:03:39.370> and<00:03:39.700> the<00:03:39.790> product<00:03:40.209> becomes<00:03:40.630> a

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:40.720 
product and the product becomes a

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.540 
product and the product becomes a
substrate<00:03:41.200> of<00:03:41.320> the<00:03:41.350> next<00:03:41.770> reaction<00:03:42.070> bla<00:03:42.430> bla

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:42.550 
substrate of the next reaction bla bla

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:43.740 
substrate of the next reaction bla bla
bla<00:03:42.670> until<00:03:43.090> you<00:03:43.180> end<00:03:43.360> up<00:03:43.480> with<00:03:43.630> the<00:03:43.720> end

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 
product and this end product can be very

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:49.979 
product and this end product can be very
useful<00:03:46.709> sometimes<00:03:48.150> so<00:03:49.150> let's<00:03:49.510> go<00:03:49.750> look<00:03:49.870> at

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:49.989 
useful sometimes so let's go look at

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:53.760 
useful sometimes so let's go look at
this<00:03:50.110> in<00:03:50.350> more<00:03:50.640> detail<00:03:51.640> here<00:03:52.090> so<00:03:52.840> here<00:03:53.320> we're

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:53.770 
this in more detail here so here we're

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:55.290 
this in more detail here so here we're
going<00:03:53.800> to<00:03:53.950> take<00:03:54.100> a<00:03:54.130> look<00:03:54.310> here's<00:03:54.640> a<00:03:54.790> particular

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:55.300 
going to take a look here's a particular

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:57.780 
going to take a look here's a particular
pathway<00:03:55.570> this<00:03:56.140> is<00:03:56.290> an<00:03:56.410> enzyme<00:03:56.950> over<00:03:57.340> here<00:03:57.610> and

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:57.790 
pathway this is an enzyme over here and

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:59.520 
pathway this is an enzyme over here and
this<00:03:58.030> is<00:03:58.090> the<00:03:58.480> substrate<00:03:58.900> that's<00:03:59.020> was<00:03:59.200> to<00:03:59.320> bind

00:03:59.520 --> 00:03:59.530 
this is the substrate that's was to bind

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:01.800 
this is the substrate that's was to bind
so<00:04:00.070> bind<00:04:00.340> so<00:04:00.580> this<00:04:00.730> gets<00:04:00.970> converted<00:04:01.330> to<00:04:01.600> this

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:01.810 
so bind so this gets converted to this

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:04.800 
so bind so this gets converted to this
whoops<00:04:02.260> to<00:04:02.800> this<00:04:02.950> guy<00:04:03.190> this<00:04:03.700> guy<00:04:03.910> binds<00:04:04.510> to<00:04:04.720> the

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:04.810 
whoops to this guy this guy binds to the

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:06.870 
whoops to this guy this guy binds to the
next<00:04:05.080> enzyme<00:04:05.260> gets<00:04:05.770> changed<00:04:06.160> slightly<00:04:06.459> binds

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:06.880 
next enzyme gets changed slightly binds

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:08.910 
next enzyme gets changed slightly binds
the<00:04:07.060> next<00:04:07.300> enzyme<00:04:07.540> gets<00:04:07.989> changed<00:04:08.260> slightly<00:04:08.709> so

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:08.920 
the next enzyme gets changed slightly so

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:11.460 
the next enzyme gets changed slightly so
on<00:04:09.070> so<00:04:09.250> forth<00:04:09.520> till<00:04:10.000> you<00:04:10.150> end<00:04:10.360> up<00:04:10.570> with<00:04:11.050> an<00:04:11.260> end

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:11.470 
on so forth till you end up with an end

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:14.220 
on so forth till you end up with an end
product<00:04:11.950> here<00:04:12.370> and<00:04:12.550> if<00:04:13.180> there's<00:04:13.450> too<00:04:13.720> much<00:04:13.750> end

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:14.230 
product here and if there's too much end

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:16.710 
product here and if there's too much end
product<00:04:14.800> this<00:04:15.310> end<00:04:15.580> product<00:04:16.120> can<00:04:16.270> actually

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:16.720 
product this end product can actually

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:20.280 
product this end product can actually
come<00:04:16.959> back<00:04:16.989> and<00:04:17.970> inhibit<00:04:18.970> this<00:04:19.510> first<00:04:19.840> enzyme

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:20.290 
come back and inhibit this first enzyme

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:21.960 
come back and inhibit this first enzyme
so<00:04:20.500> what<00:04:20.650> happens<00:04:20.979> when<00:04:21.130> that<00:04:21.250> first<00:04:21.460> enzyme

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:21.970 
so what happens when that first enzyme

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:23.820 
so what happens when that first enzyme
gets<00:04:22.510> inhibited<00:04:23.080> well<00:04:23.229> let's<00:04:23.380> take<00:04:23.560> a<00:04:23.590> look

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:23.830 
gets inhibited well let's take a look

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:25.770 
gets inhibited well let's take a look
this<00:04:24.280> is<00:04:24.460> just<00:04:24.490> like<00:04:24.940> non-competitive

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:25.780 
this is just like non-competitive

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:26.280 
this is just like non-competitive
inhibitor

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:26.290 
inhibitor

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:29.640 
inhibitor
where<00:04:27.300> there's<00:04:28.300> another<00:04:28.840> site<00:04:29.230> and<00:04:29.260> we're

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:29.650 
where there's another site and we're

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:32.010 
where there's another site and we're
going<00:04:29.800> to<00:04:29.860> call<00:04:30.010> it<00:04:30.160> the<00:04:30.280> allosteric<00:04:31.000> site<00:04:31.420> and

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:32.020 
going to call it the allosteric site and

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:33.990 
going to call it the allosteric site and
this<00:04:32.620> end<00:04:32.860> product<00:04:33.310> can<00:04:33.460> actually<00:04:33.790> end<00:04:33.940> up

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:34.000 
this end product can actually end up

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.140 
this end product can actually end up
binding<00:04:34.660> to<00:04:35.490> another<00:04:36.490> site<00:04:36.820> called<00:04:37.120> the

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:37.150 
binding to another site called the

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:38.760 
binding to another site called the
allosteric<00:04:37.660> site<00:04:37.930> it<00:04:38.380> causes<00:04:38.740> a

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:38.770 
allosteric site it causes a

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:40.920 
allosteric site it causes a
conformational<00:04:39.010> change<00:04:39.940> in<00:04:40.180> the<00:04:40.270> actual

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:40.930 
conformational change in the actual

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:42.630 
conformational change in the actual
structure<00:04:41.260> of<00:04:41.350> the<00:04:41.470> enzyme<00:04:41.590> and<00:04:42.010> then<00:04:42.460> the

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:42.640 
structure of the enzyme and then the

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:44.340 
structure of the enzyme and then the
substrate<00:04:43.090> can<00:04:43.210> no<00:04:43.420> longer<00:04:43.660> bind<00:04:44.080> and

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:44.350 
substrate can no longer bind and

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:47.400 
substrate can no longer bind and
therefore<00:04:44.740> stops<00:04:45.070> the<00:04:45.610> entire<00:04:45.970> pathway<00:04:46.330> so<00:04:47.170> if

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:47.410 
therefore stops the entire pathway so if

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:50.600 
therefore stops the entire pathway so if
this<00:04:47.590> actually<00:04:48.040> comes<00:04:48.250> back<00:04:48.550> and<00:04:48.880> binds<00:04:49.630> here

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:50.610 
this actually comes back and binds here

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:53.700 
this actually comes back and binds here
changes<00:04:51.610> the<00:04:51.640> shape<00:04:52.150> of<00:04:52.420> this<00:04:53.050> particular

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:53.710 
changes the shape of this particular

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:56.310 
changes the shape of this particular
enzyme<00:04:54.030> I'm<00:04:55.030> just<00:04:55.450> going<00:04:55.720> to<00:04:55.750> match<00:04:55.900> it<00:04:55.930> over

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:56.320 
enzyme I'm just going to match it over

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:58.740 
enzyme I'm just going to match it over
here<00:04:56.500> now<00:04:56.680> this<00:04:57.520> substrate<00:04:57.940> can<00:04:58.210> bind<00:04:58.390> and<00:04:58.690> it

00:04:58.740 --> 00:04:58.750 
here now this substrate can bind and it

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:00.510 
here now this substrate can bind and it
ends<00:04:58.990> up<00:04:59.020> stopping<00:04:59.320> the<00:04:59.680> entire<00:04:59.980> thing<00:05:00.250> so

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:00.520 
ends up stopping the entire thing so

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:02.400 
ends up stopping the entire thing so
it's<00:05:00.700> just<00:05:00.940> an<00:05:01.120> example<00:05:01.270> of<00:05:01.750> negative

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:02.410 
it's just an example of negative

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:04.770 
it's just an example of negative
feedback<00:05:02.910> so<00:05:03.910> let's<00:05:04.090> look<00:05:04.240> at<00:05:04.390> some<00:05:04.570> of<00:05:04.690> the

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:04.780 
feedback so let's look at some of the

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:06.660 
feedback so let's look at some of the
words<00:05:05.020> that<00:05:05.200> are<00:05:05.410> important<00:05:05.770> here<00:05:05.800> mm-hmm

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:06.670 
words that are important here mm-hmm

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:08.880 
words that are important here mm-hmm
it's<00:05:07.330> called<00:05:07.570> a<00:05:07.750> Listeria<00:05:08.320> it's<00:05:08.470> an<00:05:08.590> example

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:08.890 
it's called a Listeria it's an example

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:11.220 
it's called a Listeria it's an example
of<00:05:09.190> negative<00:05:09.730> feedback<00:05:10.150> and<00:05:10.570> it's<00:05:10.960> end

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:11.230 
of negative feedback and it's end

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:14.220 
of negative feedback and it's end
product<00:05:11.740> inhibition<00:05:12.370> so<00:05:13.360> in<00:05:13.690> metabolic

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:14.230 
product inhibition so in metabolic

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:15.960 
product inhibition so in metabolic
pathways<00:05:14.710> the<00:05:15.070> product<00:05:15.520> of<00:05:15.700> the<00:05:15.790> last

pathways the product of the last

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:18.540 
pathways the product of the last
reaction<00:05:16.540> in<00:05:16.630> the<00:05:16.720> pathway<00:05:16.870> can<00:05:17.620> inhibit<00:05:17.980> the

enzyme only the first enzyme the enzyme
that<00:05:21.880> catalyzes<00:05:22.300> the<00:05:22.540> very<00:05:22.720> first<00:05:22.990> reaction

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:23.440 
that catalyzes the very first reaction

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:25.080 
that catalyzes the very first reaction
that's<00:05:23.590> all<00:05:23.770> we<00:05:23.920> need<00:05:24.100> to<00:05:24.130> do<00:05:24.400> actually<00:05:24.940> and

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:25.090 
that's all we need to do actually and

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:27.480 
that's all we need to do actually and
this<00:05:25.690> enzyme<00:05:26.200> that's<00:05:26.440> inhibited<00:05:27.040> is<00:05:27.190> called

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:27.490 
this enzyme that's inhibited is called

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:29.280 
this enzyme that's inhibited is called
the<00:05:27.640> allosteric<00:05:27.970> enzyme<00:05:28.660> because<00:05:28.930> this<00:05:29.110> one

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:29.290 
the allosteric enzyme because this one

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:31.980 
the allosteric enzyme because this one
kind<00:05:29.500> of<00:05:29.560> controls<00:05:30.040> the<00:05:30.580> fate<00:05:30.910> of<00:05:31.120> the<00:05:31.630> rest<00:05:31.810> of

kind of controls the fate of the rest of
the<00:05:32.110> pathway<00:05:33.060> so<00:05:34.060> the<00:05:34.180> substrate<00:05:34.600> actually<00:05:35.230> oh

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:35.260 
the pathway so the substrate actually oh

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:36.600 
the pathway so the substrate actually oh
this<00:05:35.590> is<00:05:35.710> just<00:05:35.890> talking<00:05:36.010> about<00:05:36.160> the<00:05:36.280> beginning

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:36.610 
this is just talking about the beginning

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:37.740 
this is just talking about the beginning
this<00:05:36.730> is<00:05:36.790> what<00:05:37.000> supposed<00:05:37.180> to<00:05:37.270> happen<00:05:37.390> here<00:05:37.630> the

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:37.750 
this is what supposed to happen here the

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:39.330 
this is what supposed to happen here the
substrate<00:05:38.140> binds<00:05:38.320> to<00:05:38.500> the<00:05:38.590> active<00:05:38.710> site<00:05:38.920> and

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:39.340 
substrate binds to the active site and

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:43.500 
substrate binds to the active site and
gets<00:05:39.520> converted<00:05:39.850> to<00:05:40.000> the<00:05:40.150> product<00:05:40.540> and<00:05:42.510> the

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:43.510 
gets converted to the product and the

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:44.880 
gets converted to the product and the
substrate<00:05:43.870> of<00:05:43.960> the<00:05:44.110> first<00:05:44.350> enzyme<00:05:44.740> is

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:44.890 
substrate of the first enzyme is

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:46.410 
substrate of the first enzyme is
eventually<00:05:45.190> converted<00:05:45.910> to<00:05:45.970> the<00:05:46.090> final

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:46.420 
eventually converted to the final

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:48.450 
eventually converted to the final
product<00:05:46.750> of<00:05:46.840> the<00:05:46.960> pathway<00:05:47.140> which<00:05:47.860> also<00:05:48.070> acts

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:48.460 
product of the pathway which also acts

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:50.580 
product of the pathway which also acts
as<00:05:48.670> an<00:05:48.910> inhibitor<00:05:49.150> to<00:05:49.630> the<00:05:49.660> original<00:05:50.140> enzyme

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:50.590 
as an inhibitor to the original enzyme

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:54.390 
as an inhibitor to the original enzyme
and<00:05:50.970> here<00:05:51.970> if<00:05:52.120> the<00:05:52.450> if<00:05:52.870> the<00:05:53.770> inhibitor<00:05:54.340> is

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:54.400 
and here if the if the inhibitor is

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:55.350 
and here if the if the inhibitor is
actually<00:05:54.820> bound

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:55.360 
actually bound

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:57.300 
actually bound
well<00:05:55.510> the<00:05:55.720> substrate<00:05:56.200> is<00:05:56.350> unlikely<00:05:56.920> to<00:05:57.190> be

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:57.310 
well the substrate is unlikely to be

00:05:57.310 --> 00:05:59.160 
well the substrate is unlikely to be
able<00:05:57.370> to<00:05:57.580> bind<00:05:57.790> after<00:05:58.270> the<00:05:58.420> whole<00:05:58.570> shape<00:05:58.900> has

00:05:59.160 --> 00:05:59.170 
able to bind after the whole shape has

00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:01.920 
able to bind after the whole shape has
actually<00:05:59.590> changed<00:05:59.620> right<00:06:00.280> here<00:06:00.580> and<00:06:00.730> this<00:06:01.720> end

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:01.930 
actually changed right here and this end

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:03.860 
actually changed right here and this end
product<00:06:02.350> is<00:06:02.440> also<00:06:02.650> called<00:06:03.040> the<00:06:03.160> allosteric

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:03.870 
product is also called the allosteric

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:07.140 
product is also called the allosteric
inhibitor<00:06:04.870> so<00:06:05.470> this<00:06:05.740> is<00:06:05.980> true<00:06:06.490> for<00:06:06.760> a<00:06:06.820> lot<00:06:07.120> of

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:07.150 
inhibitor so this is true for a lot of

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:09.480 
inhibitor so this is true for a lot of
pathways<00:06:07.750> you<00:06:08.380> don't<00:06:08.620> want<00:06:08.860> to<00:06:08.950> waste<00:06:09.160> a<00:06:09.370> lot

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:09.490 
pathways you don't want to waste a lot

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:11.340 
pathways you don't want to waste a lot
of<00:06:09.640> energy<00:06:10.030> in<00:06:10.270> these<00:06:10.420> metabolic<00:06:10.960> pathways

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:11.350 
of energy in these metabolic pathways

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:14.730 
of energy in these metabolic pathways
making<00:06:11.860> a<00:06:11.950> product<00:06:12.510> unless<00:06:13.510> you<00:06:13.690> need<00:06:14.020> it<00:06:14.080> so

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:14.740 
making a product unless you need it so

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:16.140 
making a product unless you need it so
this<00:06:14.890> is<00:06:15.010> a<00:06:15.040> way<00:06:15.280> to<00:06:15.340> make<00:06:15.640> sure<00:06:15.850> that<00:06:16.030> that

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:16.150 
this is a way to make sure that that

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:18.120 
this is a way to make sure that that
actually<00:06:16.660> happens<00:06:17.020> if<00:06:17.170> there's<00:06:17.350> too<00:06:17.590> much<00:06:17.620> of

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:18.130 
actually happens if there's too much of

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:21.510 
actually happens if there's too much of
the<00:06:18.580> product<00:06:18.850> or<00:06:19.290> too<00:06:20.290> much<00:06:20.440> for<00:06:20.680> example<00:06:20.800> ATP

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:21.520 
the product or too much for example ATP

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:23.670 
the product or too much for example ATP
being<00:06:21.790> produced<00:06:22.150> then<00:06:22.720> that<00:06:22.870> ATP<00:06:23.500> can

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:23.680 
being produced then that ATP can

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:25.440 
being produced then that ATP can
actually<00:06:24.010> bind<00:06:24.250> to<00:06:24.460> the<00:06:24.580> first<00:06:24.790> enzyme<00:06:25.000> and

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:25.450 
actually bind to the first enzyme and

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:29.010 
actually bind to the first enzyme and
halt<00:06:26.050> the<00:06:26.620> production<00:06:27.130> of<00:06:27.250> itself<00:06:27.580> and<00:06:28.020> then

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:29.020 
halt the production of itself and then

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:31.200 
halt the production of itself and then
if<00:06:29.140> there's<00:06:29.290> not<00:06:29.380> enough<00:06:29.440> ATP<00:06:30.250> well<00:06:30.490> this<00:06:30.700> ATP

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:31.210 
if there's not enough ATP well this ATP

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:33.000 
if there's not enough ATP well this ATP
ends<00:06:31.450> up<00:06:31.570> getting<00:06:31.660> use<00:06:31.930> as<00:06:32.110> well<00:06:32.260> the<00:06:32.680> enzymes

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:33.010 
ends up getting use as well the enzymes

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:35.490 
ends up getting use as well the enzymes
are<00:06:33.160> no<00:06:33.280> longer<00:06:33.490> inhibited<00:06:34.120> and<00:06:34.240> the<00:06:35.110> pathway

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:35.500 
are no longer inhibited and the pathway

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:37.029 
are no longer inhibited and the pathway
can<00:06:35.680> continue<00:06:36.100> again<00:06:36.340> to<00:06:36.490> produce

00:06:37.029 --> 00:06:37.039 
can continue again to produce

00:06:37.039 --> 00:06:40.209 
can continue again to produce
the<00:06:37.279> actual<00:06:37.610> product<00:06:38.089> so<00:06:38.659> at<00:06:39.020> the<00:06:39.439> end<00:06:39.619> of<00:06:40.009> this

00:06:40.209 --> 00:06:40.219 
the actual product so at the end of this

00:06:40.219 --> 00:06:41.890 
the actual product so at the end of this
entire<00:06:40.430> thing<00:06:40.879> this<00:06:41.059> make<00:06:41.240> sure<00:06:41.270> using<00:06:41.779> the

00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:41.900 
entire thing this make sure using the

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:44.529 
entire thing this make sure using the
vocabulary<00:06:42.460> correctly<00:06:43.460> the<00:06:43.909> advantage<00:06:44.300> is

00:06:44.529 --> 00:06:44.539 
vocabulary correctly the advantage is

00:06:44.539 --> 00:06:47.350 
vocabulary correctly the advantage is
that<00:06:44.569> xx<00:06:45.289> excess<00:06:46.039> buildup<00:06:46.550> of<00:06:46.909> the<00:06:47.149> end

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:47.360 
that xx excess buildup of the end

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:49.329 
that xx excess buildup of the end
product<00:06:47.839> ends<00:06:48.020> up<00:06:48.439> shutting<00:06:48.649> off<00:06:48.919> the<00:06:49.099> entire

00:06:49.329 --> 00:06:49.339 
product ends up shutting off the entire

00:06:49.339 --> 00:06:52.570 
product ends up shutting off the entire
pathway<00:06:50.439> so<00:06:51.439> we<00:06:51.589> call<00:06:51.770> this<00:06:51.979> an<00:06:52.189> allosteric

00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:52.580 
pathway so we call this an allosteric

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:55.450 
pathway so we call this an allosteric
enzyme<00:06:53.330> this<00:06:53.930> is<00:06:54.110> an<00:06:54.229> end<00:06:54.469> product<00:06:54.800> that<00:06:55.039> acts

enzyme this is an end product that acts

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:57.399 
enzyme this is an end product that acts
like<00:06:55.729> an<00:06:56.119> inhibitor<00:06:56.599> so<00:06:56.779> we<00:06:56.869> call<00:06:57.110> it<00:06:57.259> the

00:06:57.399 --> 00:06:57.409 
like an inhibitor so we call it the

00:06:57.409 --> 00:07:00.549 
like an inhibitor so we call it the
allosteric<00:06:58.270> inhibitor<00:06:59.270> overall<00:07:00.050> you<00:07:00.229> can<00:07:00.349> say

00:07:00.549 --> 00:07:00.559 
allosteric inhibitor overall you can say

00:07:00.559 --> 00:07:02.439 
allosteric inhibitor overall you can say
this<00:07:00.740> is<00:07:00.889> called<00:07:01.129> Alice<00:07:01.520> Terry<00:07:01.789> but<00:07:02.149> it's<00:07:02.330> an

00:07:05.499 --> 00:07:05.509 
example of non-competitive inhibition

00:07:05.509 --> 00:07:07.269 
example of non-competitive inhibition
it's<00:07:06.050> a<00:07:06.169> specific<00:07:06.439> example<00:07:06.979> of

non-competitive competitive inhibition
and<00:07:09.800> I<00:07:10.580> think<00:07:10.909> that's<00:07:11.120> all<00:07:11.300> really<00:07:11.990> that<00:07:12.259> you

00:07:12.399 --> 00:07:12.409 
and I think that's all really that you

00:07:12.409 --> 00:07:14.379 
and I think that's all really that you
need<00:07:12.589> to<00:07:12.710> know<00:07:12.949> here's<00:07:13.370> a<00:07:13.460> specific<00:07:14.059> example

00:07:14.379 --> 00:07:14.389 
need to know here's a specific example

00:07:14.389 --> 00:07:16.629 
need to know here's a specific example
you<00:07:14.749> can<00:07:14.930> pause<00:07:15.139> and<00:07:15.379> take<00:07:15.889> a<00:07:15.919> look<00:07:16.159> at<00:07:16.339> but

00:07:16.629 --> 00:07:16.639 
you can pause and take a look at but

00:07:16.639 --> 00:07:19.679 
you can pause and take a look at but
that's<00:07:17.389> a<00:07:17.599> lot<00:07:17.839> to<00:07:18.080> stomach<00:07:18.649> but<00:07:19.009> anyways

00:07:19.679 --> 00:07:19.689 
that's a lot to stomach but anyways

00:07:19.689 --> 00:07:22.029 
that's a lot to stomach but anyways
pause<00:07:20.689> the<00:07:20.809> video<00:07:21.080> and<00:07:21.289> then<00:07:21.529> take<00:07:21.710> a<00:07:21.740> look<00:07:21.919> at

00:07:22.029 --> 00:07:22.039 
pause the video and then take a look at

00:07:22.039 --> 00:07:24.010 
pause the video and then take a look at
that<00:07:22.219> that<00:07:22.460> is<00:07:22.610> what<00:07:22.759> we<00:07:22.879> call<00:07:23.089> allosteric

00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:24.020 
that that is what we call allosteric

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:27.369 
that that is what we call allosteric
enzyme<00:07:24.949> inhibition<00:07:25.960> now<00:07:26.960> I'm<00:07:27.020> gonna<00:07:27.139> go<00:07:27.259> get

00:07:27.369 --> 00:07:27.379 
enzyme inhibition now I'm gonna go get

00:07:27.379 --> 00:07:30.069 
enzyme inhibition now I'm gonna go get
me<00:07:27.499> some<00:07:27.680> M&amp;Ms
