holding a piece of sandpaper

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.090 
holding a piece of sandpaper
I've<00:00:21.510> been<00:00:21.779> holding<00:00:21.900> sandpaper<00:00:22.560> since<00:00:22.830> I<00:00:22.949> was

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
matter how hard I can trying to compress

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.719 
matter how hard I can trying to compress
it<00:01:07.020> with<00:01:07.290> my<00:01:07.470> between<00:01:08.369> my<00:01:08.490> thumb<00:01:08.670> and

forefinger it's slipping now the

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.760 
forefinger it's slipping now the
beautiful<00:01:12.479> thing<00:01:12.720> about<00:01:12.750> sandpaper<00:01:13.320> is<00:01:13.560> it<00:01:13.680> is

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
beautiful thing about sandpaper is it is

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.289 
beautiful thing about sandpaper is it is
abrasive<00:01:14.210> so<00:01:15.210> what<00:01:15.390> you<00:01:15.540> do<00:01:16.520> method<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:18.060> first

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
abrasive so what you do method the first

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:26.270 
abrasive so what you do method the first
is<00:01:19.009> fold<00:01:20.009> it<00:01:20.100> over<00:01:20.280> itself<00:01:21.890> in<00:01:22.890> three<00:01:23.400> and<00:01:25.280> this

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
is fold it over itself in three and this

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.149 
is fold it over itself in three and this
is<00:01:26.430> my<00:01:26.580> favorite<00:01:26.909> bit<00:01:27.229> the<00:01:28.229> sandpaper<00:01:28.650> grips

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
is my favorite bit the sandpaper grips

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:34.340 
is my favorite bit the sandpaper grips
on<00:01:29.520> the<00:01:31.040> slippery<00:01:32.040> paper<00:01:32.340> on<00:01:32.610> the<00:01:32.729> back<00:01:32.909> or<00:01:33.720> the

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
on the slippery paper on the back or the

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.609 
on the slippery paper on the back or the
grit<00:01:34.650> grips<00:01:35.310> on<00:01:36.090> the<00:01:36.240> paper<00:01:36.450> and<00:01:36.810> you<00:01:37.409> suddenly

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
grit grips on the paper and you suddenly

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.100 
grit grips on the paper and you suddenly
have<00:01:37.799> a<00:01:37.950> tool<00:01:38.310> that<00:01:38.610> is<00:01:38.880> a<00:01:38.909> tool<00:01:39.270> rather<00:01:39.930> than

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
have a tool that is a tool rather than

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.740 
have a tool that is a tool rather than
something<00:01:40.470> that<00:01:40.619> slips<00:01:40.979> and<00:01:41.360> skitters<00:01:42.360> under

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
something that slips and skitters under

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.090 
something that slips and skitters under
your<00:01:42.899> fingers<00:01:43.290> while<00:01:43.439> you're<00:01:43.590> trying<00:01:43.799> to<00:01:43.920> use

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
your fingers while you're trying to use

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.240 
your fingers while you're trying to use
it<00:01:44.280> okay<00:01:45.000> so<00:01:45.509> this<00:01:45.600> is<00:01:45.780> the<00:01:45.869> one<00:01:46.020> method<00:01:46.409> the

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
it okay so this is the one method the

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:53.289 
it okay so this is the one method the
second<00:01:48.380> is<00:01:49.380> to<00:01:49.619> get<00:01:49.920> a<00:01:49.950> square<00:01:50.399> of<00:01:50.549> paper<00:01:50.759> and

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:53.299 
second is to get a square of paper and

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:59.840 
second is to get a square of paper and
cut<00:01:54.299> a<00:01:54.360> single<00:01:55.939> line<00:01:56.939> in<00:01:57.119> it<00:01:57.270> and<00:01:58.850> essentially

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
cut a single line in it and essentially

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.200 
cut a single line in it and essentially
I'm<00:02:00.630> going<00:02:00.840> to<00:02:00.899> try<00:02:01.079> and<00:02:01.200> do<00:02:01.290> this<00:02:02.060> fold<00:02:03.060> it

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
I'm going to try and do this fold it

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.310 
I'm going to try and do this fold it
over

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
over

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:10.280 
over
into<00:02:05.190> four<00:02:05.460> and<00:02:07.340> what<00:02:08.340> you<00:02:08.520> have<00:02:08.760> is<00:02:09.290> slightly

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:10.290 
into four and what you have is slightly

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:14.510 
into four and what you have is slightly
less<00:02:10.910> grippy<00:02:11.910> but<00:02:12.810> nonetheless<00:02:13.020> still<00:02:13.710> this

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
less grippy but nonetheless still this

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.280 
less grippy but nonetheless still this
is<00:02:14.670> a<00:02:14.700> much<00:02:14.970> more<00:02:15.150> substantial<00:02:15.360> pad<00:02:16.140> of

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
is a much more substantial pad of

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.140 
is a much more substantial pad of
sandpaper<00:02:16.500> and<00:02:17.010> this<00:02:17.400> means<00:02:17.610> that<00:02:17.700> that<00:02:17.910> edge

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
sandpaper and this means that that edge

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.650 
sandpaper and this means that that edge
is<00:02:19.070> really<00:02:20.070> when<00:02:20.640> you<00:02:20.760> do<00:02:20.880> find<00:02:21.210> stuff<00:02:21.450> when

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
is really when you do find stuff when

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.830 
is really when you do find stuff when
you're<00:02:21.840> going<00:02:22.500> up<00:02:22.740> to<00:02:22.770> the<00:02:23.010> corner<00:02:23.400> of<00:02:23.430> the<00:02:23.840> of

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
you're going up to the corner of the of

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.710 
you're going up to the corner of the of
a<00:02:25.440> neck<00:02:25.650> in<00:02:25.980> a<00:02:26.130> body<00:02:26.370> or<00:02:26.670> you're<00:02:27.330> trying<00:02:27.570> to

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
a neck in a body or you're trying to

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.270 
a neck in a body or you're trying to
