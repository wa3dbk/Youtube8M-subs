around<00:00:22.830> and<00:00:23.220> I've<00:00:23.519> regained<00:00:24.390> it<00:00:25.160> 450<00:00:26.160> watt<00:00:26.480> so

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:27.619 
around and I've regained it 450 watt so

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:30.310 
around and I've regained it 450 watt so
let's<00:00:28.619> have<00:00:28.740> a<00:00:28.800> closer<00:00:29.070> look<00:00:29.220> shall<00:00:29.609> we

in<00:00:43.320> it<00:00:43.440> but<00:00:43.680> obviously<00:00:44.160> nothing<00:00:44.489> too<00:00:44.670> much<00:00:45.539> to

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
in it but obviously nothing too much to

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.420 
in it but obviously nothing too much to
worry<00:00:45.809> about<00:00:46.050> and<00:00:46.800> you<00:00:46.920> can<00:00:46.950> see<00:00:47.250> the

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
middle it can be repositioned so that

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.139 
middle it can be repositioned so that
the<00:00:55.170> beam<00:00:55.500> can<00:00:55.829> be<00:00:55.949> changed<00:00:56.399> for<00:00:56.640> example<00:00:57.059> if

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
the beam can be changed for example if

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:58.880 
the beam can be changed for example if

minute the whole frame is made out of

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.030 
minute the whole frame is made out of
cast<00:01:16.979> away<00:01:18.110> just<00:01:19.110> a<00:01:19.170> quick<00:01:19.350> look<00:01:19.530> at<00:01:19.650> the<00:01:19.740> main

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
cast away just a quick look at the main

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.789 
cast away just a quick look at the main
mount<00:01:20.369> it<00:01:20.820> slid<00:01:21.750> onto<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:22.140> end<00:01:22.259> of<00:01:22.380> the<00:01:22.439> spigot

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
mount it slid onto the end of the spigot

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.190 
mount it slid onto the end of the spigot
and<00:01:23.130> then<00:01:23.820> secured<00:01:24.270> why<00:01:24.600> there<00:01:24.840> was<00:01:24.960> two<00:01:25.170> very

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
and then secured why there was two very

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.310 
and then secured why there was two very
large<00:01:25.680> grub<00:01:26.250> screws<00:01:26.580> now<00:01:27.330> the<00:01:27.390> whole<00:01:27.689> assembly

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
large grub screws now the whole assembly

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.440
