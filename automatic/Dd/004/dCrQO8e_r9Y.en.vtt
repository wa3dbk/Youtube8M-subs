00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
through point O so it looks like to me a

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.660 
through point O so it looks like to me a
lot<00:02:03.030> be<00:02:03.240> running<00:02:03.540> on<00:02:04.080> both<00:02:04.890> or<00:02:05.190> am<00:02:05.250> I<00:02:05.340> just<00:02:05.369> be

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
lot be running on both or am I just be

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.460 
lot be running on both or am I just be
running<00:02:05.759> on<00:02:06.030> sense<00:02:06.360> through<00:02:06.690> point<00:02:06.899> O<00:02:07.050> I<00:02:07.080> don't

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:07.470 
running on sense through point O I don't

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:11.900 
running on sense through point O I don't
really<00:02:07.680> know<00:02:07.920> but<00:02:09.979> it's<00:02:10.979> probably<00:02:11.520> think

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
really know but it's probably think

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.910 
really know but it's probably think
that's<00:02:12.030> basically<00:02:12.600> like<00:02:12.690> the<00:02:13.110> other<00:02:13.560> phones

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
that's basically like the other phones

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.060 
that's basically like the other phones
it's<00:02:14.250> just<00:02:14.550> that<00:02:14.850> it's<00:02:15.840> got<00:02:16.020> an<00:02:16.110> LCD<00:02:16.560> screen

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.070 
it's just that it's got an LCD screen

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:23.300 
it's just that it's got an LCD screen
and<00:02:17.430> it's<00:02:17.730> set<00:02:18.270> up<00:02:18.300> different<00:02:18.840> I<00:02:22.190> think<00:02:23.190> it's

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
and it's set up different I think it's

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.740 
and it's set up different I think it's
got<00:02:23.459> a<00:02:23.489> better<00:02:23.760> video<00:02:24.090> camera<00:02:24.750> in<00:02:24.840> it<00:02:24.959> too<00:02:26.750> so

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
got a better video camera in it too so

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.900 
got a better video camera in it too so
this<00:02:28.470> phone<00:02:28.709> would<00:02:28.860> be<00:02:28.920> good<00:02:29.250> for<00:02:29.489> you<00:02:29.520> if<00:02:29.610> you

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
this phone would be good for you if you

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:34.180

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
think they came out with some new apps

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:44.690 
think they came out with some new apps
for<00:02:36.630> two<00:02:38.750> so<00:02:40.820> good<00:02:41.820> phone<00:02:42.470> a<00:02:43.470> good<00:02:44.190> quality

for two so good phone a good quality
phone<00:02:45.120> I<00:02:48.890> think<00:02:49.890> our<00:02:50.220> I<00:02:50.610> heard<00:02:51.410> from<00:02:52.410> this

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
phone I think our I heard from this

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:58.220 
phone I think our I heard from this
website<00:02:52.920> to<00:02:53.190> that<00:02:54.950> the<00:02:55.950> internet<00:02:56.549> are<00:02:56.900> I<00:02:57.900> heard

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
website to that the internet are I heard

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.470 
website to that the internet are I heard
from<00:02:58.410> somewhere<00:02:58.799> that<00:02:58.920> the<00:02:59.040> internet<00:02:59.459> on<00:02:59.670> this

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
from somewhere that the internet on this

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.069 
from somewhere that the internet on this
is<00:03:00.690> going<00:03:00.870> to<00:03:00.930> run<00:03:01.110> faster<00:03:02.209> so<00:03:03.209> the<00:03:03.600> faster

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:04.079 
is going to run faster so the faster

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:06.710 
is going to run faster so the faster
networking<00:03:04.769> and<00:03:04.980> I<00:03:05.790> think<00:03:06.000> it<00:03:06.120> might<00:03:06.269> be<00:03:06.299> 4g

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
networking and I think it might be 4g

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.569 
networking and I think it might be 4g
