right like I've been I hopefully you
guys<00:00:46.770> waiting<00:00:47.129> it<00:00:47.219> for<00:00:47.340> this<00:00:47.430> to<00:00:47.579> like<00:00:47.700> we've

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
guys waiting it for this to like we've

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.279 
guys waiting it for this to like we've
been<00:00:47.940> speculating<00:00:48.629> that<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:48.870> quiver<00:00:49.110> is

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
been speculating that the quiver is

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.110 
been speculating that the quiver is
actually<00:00:49.680> going<00:00:49.829> to<00:00:49.920> be<00:00:50.010> a<00:00:50.100> thing<00:00:50.399> for<00:00:50.640> a<00:00:50.700> long

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
actually going to be a thing for a long

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.990 
actually going to be a thing for a long
long<00:00:51.539> time<00:00:51.600> now<00:00:52.260> but<00:00:52.500> real<00:00:53.280> quick<00:00:53.430> though<00:00:53.820> too

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
long time now but real quick though too

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.910 
long time now but real quick though too
is<00:00:54.030> I<00:00:54.180> won't<00:00:54.329> say<00:00:54.480> the<00:00:54.809> shield<00:00:55.199> I'm<00:00:55.469> not<00:00:55.649> sure

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
is I won't say the shield I'm not sure

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.350 
is I won't say the shield I'm not sure
how<00:00:56.100> it's<00:00:56.219> gonna<00:00:56.309> work<00:00:56.430> like<00:00:56.789> I'm<00:00:56.969> assuming

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
how it's gonna work like I'm assuming

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.729 
how it's gonna work like I'm assuming
it's<00:00:57.449> your<00:00:57.570> shields<00:00:57.870> cuz<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.199> way<00:00:58.440> it<00:00:58.530> looks

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
it's your shields cuz the way it looks

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.720 
it's your shields cuz the way it looks
and<00:00:58.949> I'm<00:00:59.520> hoping<00:00:59.940> how<00:01:00.600> it<00:01:00.719> works<00:01:00.870> is<00:01:01.109> it<00:01:01.410> like

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:01.730 
and I'm hoping how it works is it like

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:04.250 
and I'm hoping how it works is it like
whenever<00:01:02.730> you<00:01:02.910> block<00:01:03.210> it<00:01:03.510> would<00:01:03.780> bring<00:01:03.989> up<00:01:04.140> the

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
whenever you block it would bring up the

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.320 
whenever you block it would bring up the
other<00:01:04.439> arm<00:01:04.830> so<00:01:05.400> hopefully<00:01:05.670> like<00:01:05.700> you<00:01:06.030> know<00:01:06.150> now

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
other arm so hopefully like you know now

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:07.429 
other arm so hopefully like you know now
whenever<00:01:06.510> you<00:01:06.659> block<00:01:06.869> with<00:01:07.020> a<00:01:07.049> sword<00:01:07.350> or

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
whenever you block with a sword or

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:08.630 
whenever you block with a sword or
something<00:01:07.680> you<00:01:07.740> just<00:01:07.830> blocks<00:01:08.130> with<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.400> sword

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
something you just blocks with the sword

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.100 
something you just blocks with the sword
hopefully<00:01:09.420> they<00:01:09.510> don't<00:01:09.630> make<00:01:09.780> it<00:01:09.960> they'll

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
hopefully they don't make it they'll

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.840 
hopefully they don't make it they'll
change<00:01:10.409> it<00:01:10.650> I<00:01:10.860> don't<00:01:11.520> know<00:01:11.580> how<00:01:11.670> this<00:01:11.790> is

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
actually gonna work I don't know if I

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.289

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
at the sword it'll bring up the shield

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.520 
at the sword it'll bring up the shield
like<00:01:21.090> kind<00:01:21.420> of<00:01:21.450> underneath<00:01:21.869> you<00:01:22.170> like<00:01:22.350> where

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
like kind of underneath you like where

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.740 
like kind of underneath you like where
your<00:01:22.680> hotbar<00:01:22.920> is<00:01:23.280> I<00:01:23.520> mean<00:01:23.939> we<00:01:24.030> cover<00:01:24.270> up<00:01:24.479> some

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750

of that or I just wouldn't cover it up
in<00:01:26.369> behind<00:01:26.820> it<00:01:26.970> but<00:01:27.420> it<00:01:27.570> helped<00:01:27.750> calm<00:01:27.990> behind

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
in behind it but it helped calm behind

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:29.960 
in behind it but it helped calm behind
that<00:01:28.560> you<00:01:29.159> guys<00:01:29.310> like<00:01:29.430> this<00:01:29.549> it'd<00:01:29.820> be<00:01:29.880> like

you're poking out from underneath it or
like<00:01:31.979> over<00:01:32.340> it<00:01:32.400> i<00:01:32.460> think<00:01:32.610> that<00:01:32.700> would<00:01:32.759> be<00:01:32.880> super

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
like over it i think that would be super

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.940 
like over it i think that would be super
awesome<00:01:33.180> but<00:01:33.750> ok<00:01:33.930> so<00:01:34.320> it's<00:01:34.590> just<00:01:34.740> speculation

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
awesome but ok so it's just speculation

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.310 
awesome but ok so it's just speculation
I<00:01:35.520> don't<00:01:35.850> know<00:01:35.939> about<00:01:36.060> that<00:01:36.180> okay<00:01:36.900> so<00:01:36.990> onto<00:01:37.229> the

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
I don't know about that okay so onto the

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.140 
I don't know about that okay so onto the
quiver<00:01:37.560> so<00:01:38.189> you<00:01:38.250> can<00:01:38.400> see<00:01:38.549> along<00:01:38.729> with<00:01:39.000> the

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
quiver so you can see along with the

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.249 
quiver so you can see along with the
quiver<00:01:39.360> we're<00:01:39.509> going<00:01:39.630> to<00:01:39.689> be<00:01:39.750> getting<00:01:39.840> a<00:01:40.020> bunch

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
quiver we're going to be getting a bunch

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.710 
quiver we're going to be getting a bunch
of<00:01:40.409> new<00:01:40.680> types<00:01:40.920> of<00:01:41.220> arrows<00:01:41.460> so<00:01:42.360> we<00:01:42.479> don't

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
of new types of arrows so we don't

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:43.999 
of new types of arrows so we don't
actually<00:01:42.810> know<00:01:43.110> what<00:01:43.409> the<00:01:43.560> arrows<00:01:43.770> are<00:01:43.829> going

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
actually know what the arrows are going

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.200 
actually know what the arrows are going
to<00:01:44.070> do<00:01:44.130> like<00:01:44.430> I<00:01:44.549> said<00:01:44.700> we<00:01:44.790> just<00:01:44.970> got<00:01:45.090> the

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
to do like I said we just got the

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.330 
to do like I said we just got the
picture<00:01:45.600> but<00:01:46.020> I<00:01:46.079> can<00:01:46.350> speculate<00:01:46.829> so<00:01:47.100> I<00:01:47.130> have

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
picture but I can speculate so I have

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.399 
picture but I can speculate so I have
some<00:01:47.520> ideas<00:01:47.610> of<00:01:47.909> what<00:01:48.149> the<00:01:48.750> arrows<00:01:49.079> actually

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
some ideas of what the arrows actually

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.069 
some ideas of what the arrows actually
might<00:01:49.590> do<00:01:49.920> ok<00:01:50.850> so<00:01:50.909> because<00:01:51.299> they're<00:01:51.509> colored<00:01:51.869> i

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
might do ok so because they're colored i

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:53.780 
might do ok so because they're colored i
was<00:01:52.409> thinking<00:01:52.770> like<00:01:52.799> okay<00:01:53.189> let's<00:01:53.369> go<00:01:53.549> with<00:01:53.640> the

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
was thinking like okay let's go with the

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.789 
was thinking like okay let's go with the
green<00:01:54.030> it's<00:01:54.210> going<00:01:54.390> from<00:01:54.600> a<00:01:54.720> right<00:01:55.140> to<00:01:55.320> left<00:01:55.530> so

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
green it's going from a right to left so

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.219 
green it's going from a right to left so
the<00:01:56.399> bottom<00:01:56.579> the<00:01:57.180> greet<00:01:57.509> there's<00:01:57.719> a<00:01:57.780> green<00:01:58.049> one

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
the bottom the greet there's a green one

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.139 
the bottom the greet there's a green one
i'm<00:01:58.619> actually<00:01:59.009> thinking<00:01:59.219> that<00:01:59.549> like<00:01:59.790> it<00:01:59.939> takes

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
i'm actually thinking that like it takes

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.749 
i'm actually thinking that like it takes
a<00:02:00.270> slime<00:02:00.689> or<00:02:00.930> something<00:02:01.320> to<00:02:01.500> make<00:02:01.530> it<00:02:01.770> like<00:02:02.610> you

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
a slime or something to make it like you

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.730 
a slime or something to make it like you
mix<00:02:02.969> a<00:02:03.060> slime<00:02:03.450> with<00:02:03.750> an<00:02:03.869> arrow<00:02:04.049> and<00:02:04.439> then

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
mix a slime with an arrow and then

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.620 
mix a slime with an arrow and then
that's<00:02:04.920> how<00:02:05.070> you<00:02:05.130> make<00:02:05.340> it<00:02:05.579> i<00:02:05.759> guess<00:02:06.299> a<00:02:06.329> slime

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
that's how you make it i guess a slime

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.419 
that's how you make it i guess a slime
ball<00:02:06.840> then<00:02:07.649> i<00:02:07.680> was<00:02:07.829> thinking<00:02:08.099> that<00:02:08.160> maybe<00:02:08.220> that

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
ball then i was thinking that maybe that

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.729 
ball then i was thinking that maybe that
the<00:02:08.580> slime<00:02:08.970> like<00:02:09.599> the<00:02:09.810> slime<00:02:10.110> arrow<00:02:10.440> maybe

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
the slime like the slime arrow maybe

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.309 
the slime like the slime arrow maybe
it's<00:02:10.920> what<00:02:11.009> it'll<00:02:11.129> be<00:02:11.250> and

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:12.319 
it's what it'll be and

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:13.599 
it's what it'll be and
actually<00:02:12.560> whenever<00:02:12.709> you<00:02:12.890> get<00:02:13.010> hit<00:02:13.280> with<00:02:13.430> it

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:13.609 
actually whenever you get hit with it

00:02:13.609 --> 00:02:15.699 
actually whenever you get hit with it
it's<00:02:14.090> like<00:02:14.239> having<00:02:14.540> slowness<00:02:15.200> on<00:02:15.379> it's<00:02:15.590> what<00:02:15.680> i

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:15.709 
it's like having slowness on it's what i

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:17.500 
it's like having slowness on it's what i
was<00:02:15.890> thinking<00:02:16.219> like<00:02:16.249> it's<00:02:16.579> some<00:02:17.090> sort<00:02:17.239> of<00:02:17.359> like

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
was thinking like it's some sort of like

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.449 
was thinking like it's some sort of like
effect<00:02:18.049> like<00:02:18.560> because<00:02:18.769> I<00:02:18.859> why<00:02:19.159> else<00:02:19.310> would

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:19.459 
effect like because I why else would

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:20.770 
effect like because I why else would
they<00:02:19.579> have<00:02:19.849> arrows<00:02:20.269> unless<00:02:20.480> they<00:02:20.659> do

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
they have arrows unless they do

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:22.569 
they have arrows unless they do
something<00:02:20.810> different<00:02:21.469> now<00:02:22.159> I<00:02:22.189> was<00:02:22.340> thinking

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:22.579 
something different now I was thinking

00:02:22.579 --> 00:02:24.520 
something different now I was thinking
it<00:02:22.670> the<00:02:22.700> next<00:02:23.060> one<00:02:23.180> over<00:02:23.540> from<00:02:23.900> it<00:02:24.019> it's<00:02:24.139> a<00:02:24.260> dart

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
it the next one over from it it's a dart

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.250 
it the next one over from it it's a dart
like<00:02:24.739> the<00:02:24.889> dark<00:02:25.219> you<00:02:25.280> know<00:02:25.489> black<00:02:25.790> arrow<00:02:26.260> so

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
like the dark you know black arrow so

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:28.839 
like the dark you know black arrow so
I'm<00:02:27.349> assuming<00:02:27.469> probably<00:02:27.769> like<00:02:28.069> another<00:02:28.340> flint

00:02:28.839 --> 00:02:28.849 
I'm assuming probably like another flint

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:30.309 
I'm assuming probably like another flint
maybe<00:02:29.180> it<00:02:29.299> takes<00:02:29.569> to<00:02:29.780> make<00:02:29.930> it<00:02:29.959> or<00:02:30.170> like<00:02:30.290> a

00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:30.319 
maybe it takes to make it or like a

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:32.379 
maybe it takes to make it or like a
stone<00:02:30.709> or<00:02:31.040> something<00:02:31.069> when<00:02:31.939> I<00:02:31.969> was<00:02:32.120> thinking

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:32.389 
stone or something when I was thinking

00:02:32.389 --> 00:02:34.270 
stone or something when I was thinking
for<00:02:32.510> that<00:02:32.599> one<00:02:32.810> is<00:02:33.019> just<00:02:33.769> I<00:02:33.859> don't<00:02:33.980> know<00:02:34.069> just

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
for that one is just I don't know just

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:35.679 
for that one is just I don't know just
the<00:02:34.370> way<00:02:34.579> they<00:02:34.790> normally<00:02:34.939> have<00:02:35.150> these<00:02:35.510> in

00:02:35.679 --> 00:02:35.689 
the way they normally have these in

00:02:35.689 --> 00:02:38.140 
the way they normally have these in
games<00:02:35.930> i<00:02:36.170> feel<00:02:36.379> like<00:02:36.530> this<00:02:37.099> arrow<00:02:37.459> would

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
games i feel like this arrow would

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:41.069 
games i feel like this arrow would
either<00:02:38.239> just<00:02:38.840> do<00:02:39.019> more<00:02:39.200> damage<00:02:39.409> outright<00:02:40.099> or

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:41.079 
either just do more damage outright or

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:43.449 
either just do more damage outright or
maybe<00:02:42.079> like<00:02:42.379> if<00:02:42.650> the<00:02:42.980> person<00:02:43.310> is<00:02:43.370> wearing

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:43.459 
maybe like if the person is wearing

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:46.149 
maybe like if the person is wearing
armor<00:02:44.090> it<00:02:44.269> does<00:02:44.719> more<00:02:45.019> it<00:02:45.260> is<00:02:45.530> more<00:02:45.769> damage

00:02:46.149 --> 00:02:46.159 
armor it does more it is more damage

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:47.170 
armor it does more it is more damage
when<00:02:46.370> they're<00:02:46.489> doing<00:02:46.639> art<00:02:46.909> when<00:02:47.090> they're

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
when they're doing art when they're

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:48.670 
when they're doing art when they're
wearing<00:02:47.389> armor<00:02:47.719> and<00:02:48.109> give<00:02:48.230> me<00:02:48.349> it<00:02:48.439> cuts

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
wearing armor and give me it cuts

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.080 
wearing armor and give me it cuts
through<00:02:48.799> the<00:02:49.040> armor<00:02:49.459> as<00:02:49.609> if<00:02:49.760> it<00:02:49.879> like<00:02:49.969> it

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
through the armor as if it like it

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:52.179 
through the armor as if it like it
wasn't<00:02:50.389> there<00:02:50.629> may<00:02:51.319> be<00:02:51.349> like<00:02:51.560> when<00:02:51.739> you<00:02:51.769> hit

00:02:52.179 --> 00:02:52.189 
wasn't there may be like when you hit

00:02:52.189 --> 00:02:54.009 
wasn't there may be like when you hit
the<00:02:52.310> orange<00:02:52.609> one<00:02:52.790> it<00:02:53.299> makes<00:02:53.480> you<00:02:53.599> like<00:02:53.810> less

00:02:54.009 --> 00:02:54.019 
the orange one it makes you like less

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:56.110 
the orange one it makes you like less
damage<00:02:54.560> or<00:02:54.980> maybe<00:02:55.250> it's<00:02:55.430> the<00:02:55.549> opposite<00:02:56.060> of

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
damage or maybe it's the opposite of

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.240 
damage or maybe it's the opposite of
that<00:02:56.239> one<00:02:56.540> where<00:02:56.780> like<00:02:57.409> when<00:02:57.650> you<00:02:57.769> have<00:02:57.889> armor

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 
that one where like when you have armor

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:00.069 
that one where like when you have armor
on<00:02:58.400> it<00:02:58.549> does<00:02:58.669> weigh<00:02:58.969> less<00:02:59.299> damage<00:02:59.780> or<00:02:59.900> when<00:02:59.989> you

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:00.079 
on it does weigh less damage or when you

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:02.679 
on it does weigh less damage or when you
don't<00:03:00.379> have<00:03:00.590> armor<00:03:00.949> on<00:03:01.069> it<00:03:01.189> does<00:03:01.370> you<00:03:01.909> no<00:03:02.060> more

00:03:02.679 --> 00:03:02.689 
don't have armor on it does you no more

00:03:02.689 --> 00:03:03.819 
don't have armor on it does you no more
it<00:03:02.959> does<00:03:03.079> a<00:03:03.109> little<00:03:03.230> bit<00:03:03.439> more<00:03:03.590> than<00:03:03.650> normal

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:03.829 
it does a little bit more than normal

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:05.830 
it does a little bit more than normal
arrow<00:03:04.310> then<00:03:05.060> last<00:03:05.239> but<00:03:05.329> not<00:03:05.510> least<00:03:05.569> we<00:03:05.810> have

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 
arrow then last but not least we have

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.929 
arrow then last but not least we have
the<00:03:05.930> gold<00:03:06.290> arrow<00:03:06.560> and<00:03:06.980> I'm<00:03:07.370> assuming<00:03:07.849> this

00:03:07.929 --> 00:03:07.939 
the gold arrow and I'm assuming this

00:03:07.939 --> 00:03:09.339 
the gold arrow and I'm assuming this
takes<00:03:08.209> gold<00:03:08.480> to<00:03:08.689> make<00:03:08.810> so<00:03:08.989> I<00:03:09.019> feel<00:03:09.169> like<00:03:09.199> this

00:03:09.339 --> 00:03:09.349 
takes gold to make so I feel like this

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:10.390 
takes gold to make so I feel like this
would<00:03:09.439> be<00:03:09.530> like<00:03:09.560> one<00:03:09.829> of<00:03:09.859> the<00:03:09.980> more<00:03:10.099> expensive

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 
would be like one of the more expensive

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.449 
would be like one of the more expensive
ones<00:03:11.000> so<00:03:11.810> but<00:03:12.049> like<00:03:12.169> I<00:03:12.349> would<00:03:12.769> rack<00:03:13.010> in<00:03:13.159> my<00:03:13.250> mind

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:13.459 
ones so but like I would rack in my mind

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:15.849 
ones so but like I would rack in my mind
I<00:03:13.669> don't<00:03:13.879> know<00:03:14.000> what<00:03:14.299> it<00:03:14.419> would<00:03:14.540> do<00:03:14.870> like<00:03:15.620> all<00:03:15.829> I

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:15.859 
I don't know what it would do like all I

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:18.580 
I don't know what it would do like all I
know<00:03:16.010> about<00:03:16.189> gold<00:03:16.579> is<00:03:16.819> it's<00:03:17.060> heavy<00:03:17.329> but<00:03:17.750> I<00:03:18.169> feel

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
know about gold is it's heavy but I feel

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:19.839 
know about gold is it's heavy but I feel
like<00:03:18.620> we<00:03:18.799> already<00:03:18.859> have<00:03:19.159> the<00:03:19.310> green<00:03:19.549> oak<00:03:19.729> I

00:03:19.839 --> 00:03:19.849 
like we already have the green oak I

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:21.610 
like we already have the green oak I
think<00:03:20.060> the<00:03:20.150> green<00:03:20.329> one<00:03:20.509> does<00:03:20.689> slow<00:03:20.989> you<00:03:21.049> down<00:03:21.319> I

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 
think the green one does slow you down I

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:23.439 
think the green one does slow you down I
don't<00:03:22.220> know<00:03:22.310> why<00:03:22.519> I<00:03:22.549> get<00:03:22.790> this<00:03:22.909> feeling<00:03:22.970> but<00:03:23.389> I

00:03:23.439 --> 00:03:23.449 
don't know why I get this feeling but I

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:25.509 
don't know why I get this feeling but I
have<00:03:23.629> this<00:03:23.780> feeling<00:03:23.959> but<00:03:24.709> yeah<00:03:24.859> i<00:03:24.889> just<00:03:25.040> cannot

00:03:25.509 --> 00:03:25.519 
have this feeling but yeah i just cannot

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:27.999 
have this feeling but yeah i just cannot
figure<00:03:25.879> out<00:03:26.150> what<00:03:26.629> i<00:03:26.659> like<00:03:27.139> I<00:03:27.379> had<00:03:27.799> no

00:03:27.999 --> 00:03:28.009 
figure out what i like I had no

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:29.319 
figure out what i like I had no
speculation<00:03:28.519> for<00:03:28.790> this<00:03:28.909> so<00:03:29.030> this<00:03:29.120> is<00:03:29.209> where<00:03:29.299> I

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:29.329 
speculation for this so this is where I

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:31.330 
speculation for this so this is where I
need<00:03:29.479> your<00:03:29.599> guys's<00:03:29.870> help<00:03:30.079> speculate<00:03:31.069> for<00:03:31.250> me

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 
need your guys's help speculate for me

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:32.740 
need your guys's help speculate for me
down<00:03:31.579> the<00:03:31.729> comments<00:03:32.090> what<00:03:32.299> you<00:03:32.389> think<00:03:32.599> the

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:32.750 
down the comments what you think the

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:34.960 
down the comments what you think the
arrows<00:03:33.109> do<00:03:33.439> I'd<00:03:33.889> to<00:03:34.129> each<00:03:34.250> individual<00:03:34.699> thing

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970 
arrows do I'd to each individual thing

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:36.879 
arrows do I'd to each individual thing
and<00:03:35.239> also<00:03:35.720> how<00:03:36.019> I'm<00:03:36.139> assuming<00:03:36.650> that<00:03:36.769> the

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:36.889 
and also how I'm assuming that the

00:03:36.889 --> 00:03:39.399 
and also how I'm assuming that the
quiver<00:03:37.129> works<00:03:37.459> back<00:03:38.030> to<00:03:38.180> the<00:03:38.269> quiver<00:03:38.509> away

00:03:39.399 --> 00:03:39.409 
quiver works back to the quiver away

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:41.229 
quiver works back to the quiver away
from<00:03:39.590> the<00:03:39.680> arrows<00:03:39.889> but<00:03:40.310> yeah<00:03:40.669> but<00:03:40.970> happening

00:03:41.229 --> 00:03:41.239 
from the arrows but yeah but happening

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:42.369 
from the arrows but yeah but happening
in<00:03:41.299> the<00:03:41.359> quiver<00:03:41.509> works<00:03:41.780> is<00:03:41.900> it<00:03:42.019> since<00:03:42.199> it<00:03:42.290> has

00:03:42.369 --> 00:03:42.379 
in the quiver works is it since it has

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:43.659 
in the quiver works is it since it has
the<00:03:42.530> arrows<00:03:42.799> like<00:03:42.949> right<00:03:43.129> next<00:03:43.280> to<00:03:43.489> it<00:03:43.519> i'm

00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:43.669 
the arrows like right next to it i'm

00:03:43.669 --> 00:03:44.770 
the arrows like right next to it i'm
assuming<00:03:43.849> that<00:03:44.060> those<00:03:44.180> are<00:03:44.359> the<00:03:44.419> arrows<00:03:44.569> you

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:44.780 
assuming that those are the arrows you

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:46.659 
assuming that those are the arrows you
actually<00:03:45.109> shoot<00:03:45.500> and<00:03:45.769> I'm<00:03:46.129> assuming<00:03:46.340> that<00:03:46.549> you

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:46.669 
actually shoot and I'm assuming that you

00:03:46.669 --> 00:03:48.429 
actually shoot and I'm assuming that you
can't<00:03:46.970> even<00:03:47.000> shoot<00:03:47.449> arrows<00:03:47.750> and<00:03:48.109> less<00:03:48.259> there

00:03:48.429 --> 00:03:48.439 
can't even shoot arrows and less there

00:03:48.439 --> 00:03:50.110 
can't even shoot arrows and less there
in<00:03:48.590> the<00:03:48.769> quiver<00:03:48.979> but<00:03:49.579> like<00:03:49.699> I<00:03:49.819> said<00:03:49.849> in<00:03:50.060> the

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:50.120 
in the quiver but like I said in the

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:51.189 
in the quiver but like I said in the
very<00:03:50.180> beginning<00:03:50.329> this<00:03:50.540> is<00:03:50.689> just<00:03:50.989> my

00:03:51.189 --> 00:03:51.199 
very beginning this is just my

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:53.740 
very beginning this is just my
speculation<00:03:52.000> you<00:03:53.000> know<00:03:53.090> that's<00:03:53.269> just<00:03:53.449> what<00:03:53.720> I

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:53.750 
speculation you know that's just what I

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:56.170 
speculation you know that's just what I
think<00:03:54.079> maybe<00:03:54.439> could<00:03:54.739> come<00:03:54.949> so<00:03:55.579> don't<00:03:55.819> quote<00:03:56.000> me

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:56.180 
think maybe could come so don't quote me

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:58.390 
think maybe could come so don't quote me
so<00:03:56.719> it's<00:03:56.930> all<00:03:57.019> over<00:03:57.139> you<00:03:57.290> in<00:03:57.319> this<00:03:57.409> video<00:03:57.590> hope

00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:58.400 
so it's all over you in this video hope

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:00.339 
so it's all over you in this video hope
