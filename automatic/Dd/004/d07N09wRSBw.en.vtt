i've gotten quick replies on my
questions<00:01:54.659> and<00:01:55.430> as<00:01:56.430> you<00:01:56.670> can<00:01:56.790> see<00:01:56.820> it<00:01:57.240> provides

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
questions and as you can see it provides

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.170 
questions and as you can see it provides
options<00:01:58.549> automatic<00:01:59.549> profiles<00:01:59.909> for<00:02:00.030> your

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
options automatic profiles for your

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.660 
options automatic profiles for your
devices<00:02:00.630> and<00:02:00.930> i<00:02:01.770> think<00:02:02.040> that<00:02:02.189> if<00:02:02.280> you<00:02:02.340> try<00:02:02.610> it

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
devices and i think that if you try it

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.789 
devices and i think that if you try it
since<00:02:03.450> there<00:02:03.630> is<00:02:03.719> a<00:02:03.750> nice<00:02:03.990> trial<00:02:04.350> period

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
since there is a nice trial period

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.490 
since there is a nice trial period
you'll<00:02:05.399> find<00:02:05.670> that<00:02:05.939> it<00:02:06.210> could<00:02:06.960> work<00:02:07.110> well<00:02:07.290> for

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
you'll find that it could work well for

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.380 
you'll find that it could work well for
you<00:02:07.649> too<00:02:07.860> so<00:02:08.580> thanks<00:02:08.879> to<00:02:08.940> the<00:02:09.090> folks<00:02:09.209> at
