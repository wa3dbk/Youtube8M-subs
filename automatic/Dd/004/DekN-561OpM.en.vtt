00:00:08.989 --> 00:00:13.489
 then we must have these three colors geography school so you can 

00:00:13.489 --> 00:00:18.250
 get easily melee in our red julian heart cope with in yellow 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:19.579
 we leave immediately 

00:00:19.579 --> 00:00:22.800
 first we have to make each ball 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.180
 on the punisher long and after that we bring each worm closer to that 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:31.180
 next in this way we start with the next 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:35.150
 and let's make the worm 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.760
 father paint then we make stops white salo 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.620
 the white worm should have a thick and compact size of chicken 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:45.530
 roast 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:49.270
 now let me put a yellow sky on it, but here it must be in that 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:52.300
 hello style everyone 3 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:55.330
 pay close 

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:58.270
 this way 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:00.550
 we have to cut them 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:03.220
 it's the same length 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:06.160
 so, my cutter 

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:07.720
 Easter 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.720
 and kay k 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.320
 react so you see 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.300
 set a worm made almost in which part 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.300
 now what we have to do we have to crush him well 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:26.360
 the voice of the aunts 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.920
 we are not kidding well 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.920
 will have to become very thin 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:36.660
 so that they stick well anyway 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:39.660
 the three colors 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:42.610
 after that 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:45.610
 essenia joke 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.710
 obviously the white part that was the highest will widen a lot 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:56.430
 more than the pink part and also the yellow part now we need to do 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:57.720
 one thing 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:59.800
 uncomplicated karaoke 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.190
 it takes a lot of time 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:06.280
 then you can help me those nails do the movement in this way 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:12.059
 or with a toothpick I prefer to do it with the waves stalking and rose bazzi 

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:14.459
 to finish in contact with 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:16.119
 white chess 

00:02:16.119 --> 00:02:19.199
 so we simply have to fade it 

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:22.549
 see what's happening 

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:25.619
 the staff fades with white 

00:02:25.619 --> 00:02:31.129
 and we have to do it until we say the non-dominant color g20 almost yahoo a 

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:35.219
 nuance pump and therefore we have to do all this procedure 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:40.519
 then he cut a piece of it because anyway it was too long what 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:41.819
 I had done 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:47.789
 and I hope you see the hut the one you tried to do in a few minutes 

00:02:48.469 --> 00:02:52.749
 you see tried to add of course you will have to do also with the yellow part e 

00:02:52.749 --> 00:02:54.059
 also on the back 

00:02:54.059 --> 00:02:57.999
 we will soon see the use of this very useful nail tool 

00:02:57.999 --> 00:03:02.559
 which I honestly don't know how to call it but they have made it a lot easier for us to say 

00:03:02.559 --> 00:03:03.619
 you see 

00:03:03.619 --> 00:03:05.079
 I faded 

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:07.349
 especially the yellow part 

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:11.200
 much more nuanced hedge than spectacular was to this why 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:16.920
 the yellow to you film or the pink one and the white one are now sorted for 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.109
 make this part fade more 

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:23.489
 added a small piece of white fimo so that they are more than samo 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:26.979
 malleable of the German cern it schumacher maio 

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:30.419
 then keep adding it came 

00:03:30.419 --> 00:03:32.419
 so in this way 

00:03:32.419 --> 00:03:34.369
 he doesn't know if he can see 

00:03:34.369 --> 00:03:39.019
 however it is no longer clear then the respect behind that just mentioned 

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:40.299
 on mature sees 

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:41.899
 here we see much more 

00:03:41.899 --> 00:03:45.569
 now what we have to do is spread it out on the table 

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:48.739
 and given we divide into so many mint rectangles 

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:50.490
 now I take 5 

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:53.490
 rectangles 

00:03:57.659 --> 00:04:00.659
 here he gets back to make another flower 

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:05.330
 and what we have to do with each of these rectangles we have to do is a 

00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:08.409
 oval and how we do then we bend 

00:04:08.409 --> 00:04:10.869
 xprotect but you don't see with fireflies 

00:04:10.869 --> 00:04:12.559
 would you confess see 

00:04:12.559 --> 00:04:15.559
 then we think of the corners with our fingers 

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:24.629
 and when it comes out we squeeze it we ask 

00:04:24.629 --> 00:04:26.490
 then click to open the corners 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:29.490
 e4 let's see 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:34.189
 baskettiamo 

00:04:34.189 --> 00:04:36.360
 here we yield 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:39.360
 and here we do this movement instead 

00:04:40.249 --> 00:04:42.050
 click crush 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:44.139
 the corners 

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:46.249
 in this way he came 

00:04:46.249 --> 00:04:49.779
 a petal and now that you complain about making lots of petals 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:54.529
 colony of these rectangles and soon we take each petal 

00:04:57.969 --> 00:05:03.090
 lory we define well and then we must stick it to the next one then 

00:05:03.089 --> 00:05:06.309
 simply 

00:05:06.309 --> 00:05:10.109
 in this way we make it closer to committing to form a heart and you will see 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:15.870
 and we are 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:20.680
 paini we put another 

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:23.680
 we can also do this work on the table 

00:05:26.009 --> 00:05:27.999
 then the other 

00:05:27.999 --> 00:05:30.389
 and this thriving hey 

00:05:30.389 --> 00:05:33.389
 just to make it even more 

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:37.330
 123 

00:05:38.559 --> 00:05:40.479
 I put the center 

00:05:40.479 --> 00:05:44.029
 I press it of course I type a hole which in the end is not a hole 

00:05:44.029 --> 00:05:45.539
 practically recreate 

00:05:45.539 --> 00:05:48.539
 the space for all the petals you see 

00:05:49.779 --> 00:05:53.039
 and then I try 

00:05:53.039 --> 00:05:56.339
 embrace the toothpick for all the petals 

00:05:57.119 --> 00:06:00.959
 then simply squeeze them around the toothpick 

00:06:03.059 --> 00:06:04.879
 expect 

00:06:04.879 --> 00:06:07.879
 glued all over 

00:06:09.509 --> 00:06:12.509
 you see 

00:06:15.409 --> 00:06:17.539
 so I try to do type 

00:06:17.539 --> 00:06:19.229
 a tip 

00:06:19.229 --> 00:06:23.609
 down here. maybe it's a real flower you have present when detached from embroidery 

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:28.820
 it's not over yet because if we want we can add the petals to the inside 

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:31.219
 so always with a toothpick 

00:06:31.219 --> 00:06:33.999
 we kind of like a furrow on the chest and lot 

00:06:33.999 --> 00:06:38.679
 and we pass the teeth style in this way making the petal crow 

00:06:40.789 --> 00:06:44.169
 then turned on the light because it is getting dark we can make one last 

00:06:44.169 --> 00:06:45.289
 what i love 

00:06:45.289 --> 00:06:48.650
 with a pair of scissors we can shoot the petal in what way 

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:53.580
 making a furrow in the center 

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:01.759
 we practically cut only the rosta part 

00:07:01.759 --> 00:07:04.759
 we pass the toothpick in the middle 

00:07:06.529 --> 00:07:09.529
 pere enlarge this page 

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:15.430
 not even for I'm going the intimissimi charge at home to take I take a 

00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:17.879
 snippet 

00:07:17.879 --> 00:07:20.580
 yellow 

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:22.020
 I put 

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:25.020
 in the center of the flower 

00:07:26.319 --> 00:07:29.319
 mashed 

00:07:30.899 --> 00:07:33.879
 eeepc face 

00:07:33.879 --> 00:07:36.879
 of the flying dots teases teeth 

00:07:37.469 --> 00:07:40.190
 it is a slow to give the finished onversion 

00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:43.190
 Hello 

00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:46.790

00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:50.050
 she loves you below 

00:07:50.050 --> 00:07:52.250
 hey gazette you can insert it
