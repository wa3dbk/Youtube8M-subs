00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
into the eight gates we'll just let this

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.240 
into the eight gates we'll just let this
whole<00:02:24.930> flame<00:02:25.260> thing<00:02:25.590> going<00:02:25.860> on<00:02:25.980> which<00:02:26.190> is

time like a mid-afternoon tiger so a lot
of<00:02:55.230> people<00:02:55.530> thought<00:02:55.620> next<00:02:55.950> one<00:02:56.070> would<00:02:56.160> be

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
of people thought next one would be

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.160 
of people thought next one would be
nighttime<00:02:56.610> dragon<00:02:57.300> because<00:02:57.570> that<00:02:57.900> will<00:02:57.959> fall

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
nighttime dragon because that will fall

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.220 
nighttime dragon because that will fall
in<00:02:58.230> line<00:02:58.380> with<00:02:58.410> the<00:02:58.680> animals<00:02:59.100> and<00:02:59.310> the<00:03:00.080> time<00:03:01.080> of

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
in line with the animals and the time of

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.620 
in line with the animals and the time of
day<00:03:01.410> but<00:03:02.040> no<00:03:02.190> we<00:03:02.340> got<00:03:02.520> a<00:03:02.550> nighttime<00:03:03.180> elephant

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
day but no we got a nighttime elephant

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:05.750 
day but no we got a nighttime elephant

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
so perhaps there'll be a dragon later Oh

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.210 
so perhaps there'll be a dragon later Oh
get<00:03:06.240> an<00:03:06.330> elephant<00:03:06.660> now<00:03:06.750> who<00:03:07.410> knows<00:03:07.590> we<00:03:08.040> don't

that's<00:03:08.580> basically<00:03:08.820> my<00:03:09.150> review<00:03:09.780> because<00:03:10.170> this

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
that's basically my review because this

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.860 
that's basically my review because this
that's<00:03:11.190> literally<00:03:11.760> all<00:03:11.970> there<00:03:12.360> is<00:03:12.510> to<00:03:12.690> say

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870

that's literally all there is to say
about<00:03:12.900> this<00:03:13.290> chapter<00:03:13.830> and<00:03:14.340> it's<00:03:14.940> actually

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
about this chapter and it's actually

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:16.850 
about this chapter and it's actually
very<00:03:15.240> disappointing<00:03:15.959> because<00:03:16.170> I<00:03:16.320> was<00:03:16.470> waiting

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 
very disappointing because I was waiting

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:18.949 
very disappointing because I was waiting
and<00:03:17.190> it's<00:03:17.670> late<00:03:17.940> to<00:03:17.970> like<00:03:18.510> it's<00:03:18.660> almost<00:03:18.810> like

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
and it's late to like it's almost like

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:20.780 
and it's late to like it's almost like
five<00:03:19.170> in<00:03:19.260> the<00:03:19.350> morning<00:03:19.680> and<00:03:19.890> I<00:03:20.310> was<00:03:20.430> waiting<00:03:20.580> a

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
five in the morning and I was waiting a

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:22.280 
five in the morning and I was waiting a
long<00:03:21.000> time<00:03:21.030> you<00:03:21.570> know<00:03:21.600> thinking<00:03:22.019> that<00:03:22.170> we're

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
long time you know thinking that we're

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:23.870 
long time you know thinking that we're
gonna<00:03:22.380> get<00:03:22.560> something<00:03:22.800> pretty<00:03:22.980> cool<00:03:23.010> and<00:03:23.370> we

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
gonna get something pretty cool and we

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.570 
gonna get something pretty cool and we
really<00:03:24.300> didn't<00:03:24.510> and<00:03:24.690> so<00:03:25.530> it<00:03:26.040> was<00:03:26.160> like<00:03:26.280> oh

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:26.580 
really didn't and so it was like oh

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:28.520

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
i would say that Rockley facial

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.650 
i would say that Rockley facial
expressions<00:03:28.920> were<00:03:29.040> pretty<00:03:29.250> cool<00:03:29.489> but<00:03:30.150> in

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
expressions were pretty cool but in

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:32.360 
expressions were pretty cool but in
beginning<00:03:31.230> the<00:03:31.320> chapter<00:03:31.620> when<00:03:31.769> nato<00:03:32.010> was<00:03:32.250> all

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
up how you know is dead in the butt

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:41.690 
up how you know is dead in the butt
kishimoto<00:03:39.480> did<00:03:39.959> you<00:03:40.890> know<00:03:40.950> what<00:03:41.459> he<00:03:41.519> usually

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700 
kishimoto did you know what he usually

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.880 
kishimoto did you know what he usually
does<00:03:42.090> so<00:03:42.450> it's<00:03:42.660> not<00:03:42.720> like<00:03:43.019> I'm<00:03:43.320> not<00:03:43.709> you<00:03:43.860> know

bashing<00:03:44.400> kishimoto<00:03:44.790> for<00:03:44.970> putting<00:03:45.150> a

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 
bashing kishimoto for putting a

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:46.850 
bashing kishimoto for putting a
flashback<00:03:45.720> in<00:03:45.750> there<00:03:46.050> because<00:03:46.200> that<00:03:46.530> is<00:03:46.709> his

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:46.860 
flashback in there because that is his

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:48.979 
flashback in there because that is his
writing<00:03:47.220> style<00:03:47.250> that's<00:03:47.700> what<00:03:47.820> he<00:03:47.910> does<00:03:48.120> he

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:48.989 
writing style that's what he does he

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:51.110 
writing style that's what he does he
always<00:03:49.500> reveals<00:03:49.980> more<00:03:50.430> things<00:03:50.760> about<00:03:50.970> a

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:53.160 
character than we knew or reveals the

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:54.890 
character than we knew or reveals the
characters<00:03:53.519> whole<00:03:53.790> backstory<00:03:54.180> once<00:03:54.600> there<00:03:54.780> by

do<00:03:55.080> something<00:03:55.350> pivotal<00:03:55.680> so<00:03:55.800> that's<00:03:55.920> not<00:03:56.070> even

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
do something pivotal so that's not even
