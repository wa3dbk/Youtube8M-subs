00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.330
 you have to pass kids and we have here a 

00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:07.900
 new video and this time has shown a 

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:10.809
 tutorial on how to use the capturer the 

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:13.419
 cat wine capture to record the 

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:16.360
 computer that this is one thing that very 

00:00:13.419 --> 00:00:18.730
 few people know how to use it and what 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:20.980
 first thing we have to do is have 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:25.090
 the obvious catcher 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:30.130
 of your program and we have to go here 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:33.219
 to this key this tool that puts 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:35.199
 now show fit and we select another 

00:00:33.219 --> 00:00:38.499
 well I had x and you do not know why 

00:00:35.199 --> 00:00:40.629
 but still works good after 

00:00:38.499 --> 00:00:44.460
 here in profile as use of what it was 

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:47.300
 arrange I'm going to put in 7 mind that 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.740
 record enough 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:53.220
 if I'm going to leave 

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:56.240
 and you give him to accept and you will stay 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:01:00.040
 detecting yes 

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:03.920
 says check that you have with state the 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:06.830
 hdmi I felt files of the capture 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:10.220
 you turn it on and it comes out 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:13.060
 but probably in what comes out in the 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:15.780
 screen here in this 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:15.780
 be 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:22.820
 what happens to you that the screen is the 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:26.150
 desktop background that you have but without 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:30.910
 no window or anything and to fix 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:30.910
 that all you have to do is 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:39.290
 well you go to the control panel that 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:42.020
 could have done from outside but I 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:46.630
 I made a mistake, sorry, you take the hardware 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:46.630
 screen sound 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:55.850
 with your screen prayer 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:58.600
 and you have to go here in the options 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:02.290
 put 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:04.300
 you will leave one or two separated in two 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:07.420
 different options 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:10.420
 you catch in 2 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:13.060
 and then duplicate on these screens in 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:16.239
 this option because otherwise I will not leave like this 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:19.810
 As I say, you have to duplicate 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:24.220
 these screens and everything is attached in a 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:25.780
 We would give him to accept if he would give that 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:29.500
 again accept that you previous another 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:32.200
 window and here is when 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:35.819
 the capturer would work but it has 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:38.640
 the program has been caught 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:41.010
 and here, as you can see, the 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.860
 capturing 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:47.470
 and it is a pass of this capturing already 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:51.720
 that if you put it to 1080 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:51.720
 I can explain the quality that it has 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.420
 and if it is changing 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:03.250
 Please look at that quality 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:05.990
 there are few captures that allow you 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:09.350
 record at this quality 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:12.200
 and programs there are also very few and 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:16.250
 Well I hope you are liking the 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:19.180
 channel if you want me to do some series 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:24.380
 of another game or anything to tell me 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:26.420
 and well, a favorite like and 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:30.380
 I think that if I'm not the first to go up 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:34.760
 this tutorial on how to capture with the 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:37.100
 cat of incatur hd the pc 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:40.150
 I must be one of the very few who 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:44.580
 have I gone crazy to be able 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:46.980
 put it to capture because I did not know how 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:50.970
 and did not find the tutorial is because 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:53.820
 internet so nothing now getting 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:57.840
 so the program what you have to do is 

00:03:53.820 --> 00:04:01.230
 give it to start recording and it is and good 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:05.130
 you are already a like a favorite one 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:08.060
 comment suggesting things and we 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:08.060
 we see the next
