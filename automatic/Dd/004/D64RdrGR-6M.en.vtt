00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
way too long for forearm so I have to

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:58.050 
way too long for forearm so I have to
cut<00:02:55.690> it<00:02:55.720> all<00:02:55.900> out<00:02:56.110> I<00:02:56.409> trim<00:02:57.099> the<00:02:57.280> smallest<00:02:57.730> piece

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
cut it all out I trim the smallest piece

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:59.610 
cut it all out I trim the smallest piece
first<00:02:58.360> just<00:02:58.840> to<00:02:58.930> make<00:02:59.079> sure<00:02:59.200> it<00:02:59.319> would<00:02:59.409> still

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 
first just to make sure it would still

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.770 
first just to make sure it would still
slide<00:02:59.890> and<00:03:00.190> then<00:03:00.519> I<00:03:00.549> trim<00:03:00.849> the<00:03:01.209> second<00:03:01.599> tier

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 
slide and then I trim the second tier

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:03.569 
slide and then I trim the second tier
piece<00:03:02.019> so<00:03:02.500> it<00:03:02.590> wasn't<00:03:02.890> really<00:03:03.069> long<00:03:03.280> for<00:03:03.459> my

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:03.579 
piece so it wasn't really long for my

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:05.610 
piece so it wasn't really long for my
forearm<00:03:03.970> I<00:03:04.150> made<00:03:04.750> sure<00:03:04.900> to<00:03:04.930> make<00:03:05.019> a<00:03:05.140> little<00:03:05.319> tab

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
forearm I made sure to make a little tab

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.500 
forearm I made sure to make a little tab
so<00:03:06.310> the<00:03:06.430> pieces<00:03:06.640> wouldn't<00:03:07.000> slide<00:03:07.180> out<00:03:07.390> the

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 
so the pieces wouldn't slide out the

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:09.720 
so the pieces wouldn't slide out the
bottom<00:03:07.810> just<00:03:08.470> keep<00:03:08.739> messing<00:03:09.010> around<00:03:09.280> with<00:03:09.609> it

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730 
bottom just keep messing around with it

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:11.729 
bottom just keep messing around with it
to<00:03:09.849> make<00:03:10.030> sure<00:03:10.299> your<00:03:10.569> drawer<00:03:10.840> slide<00:03:11.109> piece<00:03:11.349> be

you<00:03:15.220> kind<00:03:15.430> of<00:03:15.489> have<00:03:15.640> to<00:03:15.670> toy<00:03:15.879> around<00:03:15.909> with<00:03:16.269> it<00:03:16.480> a

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540 
you kind of have to toy around with it a

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:18.569 
you kind of have to toy around with it a
little<00:03:16.720> bit<00:03:16.930> at<00:03:17.170> this<00:03:17.349> point<00:03:17.440> I<00:03:17.799> need<00:03:18.280> to<00:03:18.340> draw

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:18.579 
little bit at this point I need to draw

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:21.449 
little bit at this point I need to draw
a<00:03:18.609> small<00:03:19.120> hole<00:03:19.599> in<00:03:19.900> the<00:03:19.989> top<00:03:20.560> piece<00:03:20.829> for<00:03:21.370> the

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:21.459 
a small hole in the top piece for the

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:23.550 
a small hole in the top piece for the
spring<00:03:21.790> so<00:03:22.420> it<00:03:22.540> can<00:03:22.659> be<00:03:22.810> spring-loaded

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560 
spring so it can be spring-loaded

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.440 
spring so it can be spring-loaded
drill<00:03:24.069> a<00:03:24.099> small<00:03:24.250> hole<00:03:24.430> in<00:03:24.670> the<00:03:24.700> top<00:03:24.970> piece<00:03:25.239> and

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450 
drill a small hole in the top piece and

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:28.289 
drill a small hole in the top piece and
then<00:03:26.139> two<00:03:26.409> small<00:03:26.590> holes<00:03:26.980> on<00:03:27.609> the<00:03:27.730> bottom<00:03:28.090> piece

00:03:28.289 --> 00:03:28.299 
then two small holes on the bottom piece

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:31.080 
then two small holes on the bottom piece
but<00:03:28.810> make<00:03:29.200> sure<00:03:29.230> the<00:03:29.620> spring<00:03:29.950> doesn't<00:03:30.670> stop<00:03:30.879> it

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090 
but make sure the spring doesn't stop it

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:33.569 
but make sure the spring doesn't stop it
from<00:03:31.120> sliding<00:03:31.510> back<00:03:31.930> and<00:03:31.959> forth<00:03:32.139> and<00:03:32.590> then<00:03:33.519> the

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:33.579 
from sliding back and forth and then the

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:36.330 
from sliding back and forth and then the
spring<00:03:33.940> will<00:03:34.120> run<00:03:34.299> underneath<00:03:34.950> turns<00:03:35.950> out<00:03:36.159> the

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.340 
spring will run underneath turns out the

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:37.800 
spring will run underneath turns out the
little<00:03:36.579> sliding<00:03:36.849> piece<00:03:37.180> has<00:03:37.480> a<00:03:37.510> lock

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:37.810 
little sliding piece has a lock

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:39.300 
little sliding piece has a lock
underneath<00:03:38.079> that<00:03:38.379> that<00:03:38.530> stop<00:03:38.829> the<00:03:39.010> spring

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:39.310 
underneath that that stop the spring

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:41.610 
underneath that that stop the spring
from<00:03:39.579> letting<00:03:39.849> it<00:03:39.940> slide<00:03:40.180> so<00:03:40.959> all<00:03:41.260> I<00:03:41.319> did<00:03:41.530> was

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:41.620 
from letting it slide so all I did was

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:43.439 
from letting it slide so all I did was
take<00:03:41.769> a<00:03:41.829> ball-bearing<00:03:42.250> piece<00:03:42.609> flip<00:03:43.030> it<00:03:43.120> upside

00:03:43.439 --> 00:03:43.449 
take a ball-bearing piece flip it upside

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:45.000 
take a ball-bearing piece flip it upside
down<00:03:43.480> and<00:03:43.720> that<00:03:44.139> worked<00:03:44.410> just<00:03:44.560> fine

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010 
down and that worked just fine

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:47.430 
down and that worked just fine
next<00:03:45.579> take<00:03:45.940> a<00:03:45.970> metal<00:03:46.299> tent<00:03:46.629> stake<00:03:46.900> start

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:47.440 
next take a metal tent stake start

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.680 
next take a metal tent stake start
cutting<00:03:47.680> it<00:03:47.769> down<00:03:47.949> and<00:03:48.250> hammering<00:03:48.790> it<00:03:48.910> flat<00:03:49.209> it

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:49.690 
cutting it down and hammering it flat it

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:51.689 
cutting it down and hammering it flat it
already<00:03:49.959> has<00:03:50.139> the<00:03:50.319> general<00:03:50.829> shape<00:03:51.280> of<00:03:51.310> a<00:03:51.459> blade

00:03:51.689 --> 00:03:51.699 
already has the general shape of a blade

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:53.729 
already has the general shape of a blade
but<00:03:52.090> I<00:03:52.120> want<00:03:52.449> to<00:03:52.540> make<00:03:52.690> it<00:03:52.810> a<00:03:52.870> little<00:03:53.260> more

00:03:53.729 --> 00:03:53.739 
but I want to make it a little more

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:55.920 
but I want to make it a little more
authentic<00:03:54.579> to<00:03:54.819> an<00:03:55.060> assassin's<00:03:55.510> creed<00:03:55.720> blade

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:55.930 
authentic to an assassin's creed blade

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:58.110 
authentic to an assassin's creed blade
so<00:03:56.889> I've<00:03:56.980> shaved<00:03:57.190> the<00:03:57.370> edges<00:03:57.669> a<00:03:57.699> little<00:03:57.790> bit

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:58.120 
so I've shaved the edges a little bit

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.539 
so I've shaved the edges a little bit
with<00:03:58.810> my<00:03:58.930> dremel<00:03:59.230> keep<00:03:59.859> in<00:03:59.980> mind<00:04:00.190> I'm<00:04:00.489> not

00:04:00.539 --> 00:04:00.549 
with my dremel keep in mind I'm not

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:03.390 
with my dremel keep in mind I'm not
making<00:04:01.150> this<00:04:01.239> into<00:04:01.419> an<00:04:01.569> actual<00:04:01.930> blade<00:04:02.400> I'm

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:03.400 
making this into an actual blade I'm

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.280 
making this into an actual blade I'm
just<00:04:03.639> making<00:04:04.000> it<00:04:04.030> more<00:04:04.239> into<00:04:04.419> the<00:04:04.540> shape<00:04:04.780> it's

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.290 
just making it more into the shape it's

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:08.699 
just making it more into the shape it's
still<00:04:05.590> really<00:04:05.829> dull<00:04:06.989> next<00:04:07.989> I<00:04:08.139> need<00:04:08.440> to<00:04:08.530> make<00:04:08.680> a

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:08.709 
still really dull next I need to make a

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:11.580 
still really dull next I need to make a
hair-trigger<00:04:09.430> I<00:04:10.030> bent<00:04:10.629> a<00:04:10.750> piece<00:04:10.930> of<00:04:11.079> wire<00:04:11.230> into

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:11.590 
hair-trigger I bent a piece of wire into

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:14.099 
hair-trigger I bent a piece of wire into
this<00:04:11.769> general<00:04:12.069> shape<00:04:12.449> drilled<00:04:13.449> a<00:04:13.540> hole<00:04:13.569> into

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:14.109 
this general shape drilled a hole into

00:04:14.109 --> 00:04:16.500 
this general shape drilled a hole into
the<00:04:14.260> bottom<00:04:14.590> piece<00:04:14.799> and<00:04:15.099> put<00:04:15.940> a<00:04:15.970> screw<00:04:16.239> and<00:04:16.449> a

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:16.510 
the bottom piece and put a screw and a

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:19.409 
the bottom piece and put a screw and a
nut<00:04:16.690> fur<00:04:16.900> as<00:04:17.500> you<00:04:17.709> can<00:04:17.829> see<00:04:18.039> just<00:04:19.000> a<00:04:19.150> little

00:04:19.409 --> 00:04:19.419 
nut fur as you can see just a little

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:22.350 
nut fur as you can see just a little
trigger<00:04:19.870> here<00:04:20.169> then<00:04:21.159> I<00:04:21.459> have<00:04:21.519> the<00:04:21.880> spring<00:04:22.180> to

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:22.360 
trigger here then I have the spring to

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.810 
trigger here then I have the spring to
it<00:04:22.479> but<00:04:23.110> stayed<00:04:23.349> open<00:04:23.500> after<00:04:24.190> drilling<00:04:24.580> small

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:24.820 
it but stayed open after drilling small

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:26.520 
it but stayed open after drilling small
holes<00:04:25.000> and<00:04:25.479> making<00:04:25.870> sure<00:04:25.990> the<00:04:26.110> blade<00:04:26.289> fits

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:26.530 
holes and making sure the blade fits

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:28.649 
holes and making sure the blade fits
into<00:04:26.770> the<00:04:26.889> rail<00:04:27.039> I<00:04:27.280> needed<00:04:28.060> to<00:04:28.150> make<00:04:28.270> sure<00:04:28.330> that

00:04:28.649 --> 00:04:28.659 
into the rail I needed to make sure that

00:04:28.659 --> 00:04:30.629 
into the rail I needed to make sure that
the<00:04:28.750> blade<00:04:28.990> is<00:04:29.020> also<00:04:29.560> going<00:04:29.740> to<00:04:29.830> act<00:04:30.190> as<00:04:30.490> the

00:04:30.629 --> 00:04:30.639 
the blade is also going to act as the

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:34.100 
the blade is also going to act as the
trigger<00:04:30.970> mechanism<00:04:32.010> so

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:34.110 
trigger mechanism so

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:36.590 
trigger mechanism so
you<00:04:34.140> have<00:04:34.230> to<00:04:34.320> cut<00:04:34.500> a<00:04:34.530> little<00:04:35.030> groove<00:04:36.030> into<00:04:36.390> the

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:36.600 
you have to cut a little groove into the

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:39.260 
you have to cut a little groove into the
end<00:04:36.810> of<00:04:37.110> the<00:04:37.260> tent<00:04:37.470> stake<00:04:37.820> so<00:04:38.820> when<00:04:38.970> you<00:04:39.030> push

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:39.270 
end of the tent stake so when you push

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:41.750 
end of the tent stake so when you push
that<00:04:39.300> stake<00:04:39.750> back<00:04:39.960> and<00:04:40.680> get<00:04:40.800> stuck<00:04:41.160> right

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:41.760 
that stake back and get stuck right

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:44.870 
that stake back and get stuck right
there<00:04:41.790> on<00:04:42.240> the<00:04:42.420> hair<00:04:42.570> trigger<00:04:43.550> when<00:04:44.550> the<00:04:44.580> last

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:44.880 
there on the hair trigger when the last

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:48.020 
there on the hair trigger when the last
thing<00:04:45.120> you<00:04:45.240> do<00:04:45.420> is<00:04:45.690> glue<00:04:46.500> on<00:04:46.710> the<00:04:47.670> eye<00:04:47.700> hole

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:48.030 
thing you do is glue on the eye hole

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:50.000 
thing you do is glue on the eye hole
screws<00:04:48.360> to<00:04:48.840> the<00:04:48.930> back<00:04:49.110> of<00:04:49.290> it<00:04:49.410> so<00:04:49.800> you<00:04:49.890> can
