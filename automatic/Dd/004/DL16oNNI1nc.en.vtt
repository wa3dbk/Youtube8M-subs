00:04:18.649 --> 00:04:18.659 
he did have one but in my opinion I

00:04:18.659 --> 00:04:20.779 
he did have one but in my opinion I
don't<00:04:18.780> believe<00:04:19.049> trunks<00:04:19.799> ever<00:04:19.979> had<00:04:20.370> a<00:04:20.400> tail

don't believe trunks ever had a tail
because<00:04:21.329> in
