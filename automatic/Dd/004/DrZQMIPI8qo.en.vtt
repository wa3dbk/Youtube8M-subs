do<00:01:56.430> you<00:01:56.549> think<00:01:56.729> it's<00:01:56.880> typical<00:01:57.329> female<00:01:57.750> problem

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
do you think it's typical female problem

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.859 
do you think it's typical female problem
that<00:01:58.680> fear<00:01:59.009> stops<00:01:59.399> list<00:01:59.640> no<00:02:00.329> I<00:02:00.360> think<00:02:00.570> it's<00:02:00.810> a

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
that fear stops list no I think it's a

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.109 
that fear stops list no I think it's a
pretty<00:02:01.020> universal<00:02:01.770> human<00:02:01.950> problem<00:02:02.729> i<00:02:02.850> think

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
pretty universal human problem i think

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:04.789 
pretty universal human problem i think
probably<00:02:03.360> in<00:02:03.659> some<00:02:03.869> cultures<00:02:04.140> and<00:02:04.649> there<00:02:04.740> were

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
probably in some cultures and there were

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.920 
probably in some cultures and there were
some<00:02:05.009> families<00:02:05.579> women<00:02:05.850> may<00:02:06.540> not<00:02:06.750> be

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
some families women may not be

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.910 
some families women may not be
encouraged<00:02:07.530> to<00:02:07.680> live<00:02:07.920> their<00:02:08.069> lives<00:02:08.250> and<00:02:08.670> in

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
encouraged to live their lives and in

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.500 
encouraged to live their lives and in
non-traditional<00:02:10.920> ways<00:02:11.580> and<00:02:12.090> what<00:02:12.239> I<00:02:12.270> mean<00:02:12.450> by

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
non-traditional ways and what I mean by

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.790 
non-traditional ways and what I mean by
non-traditional<00:02:12.959> is

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
non-traditional is

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.170 
non-traditional is
without<00:02:14.160> however<00:02:14.460> you<00:02:14.610> want<00:02:14.790> to<00:02:14.880> express

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
without however you want to express

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:16.940 
without however you want to express
yourself<00:02:15.510> through<00:02:15.870> the<00:02:16.200> choices<00:02:16.470> you<00:02:16.740> make

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
yourself through the choices you make

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.430 
yourself through the choices you make
that's<00:02:17.610> often<00:02:18.330> not<00:02:18.360> the<00:02:18.810> path<00:02:19.110> that<00:02:19.140> we're

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
that's often not the path that we're

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:20.810 
that's often not the path that we're
told<00:02:19.620> we<00:02:19.800> should<00:02:20.010> go<00:02:20.160> on<00:02:20.310> and<00:02:20.460> I<00:02:20.520> think<00:02:20.700> women

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:20.820 
told we should go on and I think women

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:22.700 
told we should go on and I think women
are<00:02:21.030> probably<00:02:21.210> told<00:02:21.600> more<00:02:21.960> you're<00:02:22.440> supposed

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:22.710 
are probably told more you're supposed

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:23.900 
are probably told more you're supposed
to<00:02:22.800> do<00:02:22.890> this<00:02:23.070> you're<00:02:23.400> supposed<00:02:23.580> to<00:02:23.670> do<00:02:23.760> that

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
to do this you're supposed to do that

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.060 
to do this you're supposed to do that
you're<00:02:24.270> supposed<00:02:24.480> to<00:02:24.570> do<00:02:24.690> this<00:02:24.870> and<00:02:25.290> if<00:02:25.530> they

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070 
you're supposed to do this and if they

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:27.830 
you're supposed to do this and if they
have<00:02:26.340> that<00:02:26.520> instinct<00:02:27.210> or<00:02:27.330> that<00:02:27.480> inclination

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
have that instinct or that inclination

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.020 
have that instinct or that inclination
to<00:02:28.380> do<00:02:28.530> something<00:02:28.920> that<00:02:29.040> veers<00:02:29.310> off<00:02:29.520> that<00:02:29.760> path

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
to do something that veers off that path

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.420 
to do something that veers off that path
they're<00:02:30.720> told<00:02:31.020> no<00:02:31.380> so<00:02:31.620> there<00:02:31.860> may<00:02:32.040> be<00:02:32.070> some

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
they're told no so there may be some

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.390 
they're told no so there may be some
gender<00:02:32.790> specific<00:02:33.410> you<00:02:34.410> know<00:02:34.560> stuff<00:02:34.980> but<00:02:35.370> I

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
gender specific you know stuff but I

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.480 
gender specific you know stuff but I
think<00:02:35.790> fear<00:02:36.030> is<00:02:36.060> just<00:02:36.510> across<00:02:36.900> the<00:02:37.020> board

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:37.490 
think fear is just across the board

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:39.860 
think fear is just across the board
everybody<00:02:38.490> deals<00:02:38.880> yeah<00:02:39.390> well<00:02:39.570> maybe<00:02:39.690> you
