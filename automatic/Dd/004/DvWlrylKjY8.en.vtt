how<00:00:24.930> it<00:00:24.960> works<00:00:25.170> I<00:00:25.439> shadow<00:00:25.710> on<00:00:25.859> top<00:00:26.130> of<00:00:26.279> it<00:00:26.430> and

how it works I shadow on top of it and

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.990 
how it works I shadow on top of it and
using<00:00:27.269> this<00:00:27.359> as<00:00:27.510> a<00:00:27.539> base<00:00:27.920> now<00:00:28.920> this<00:00:29.250> is<00:00:29.640> really

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
using this as a base now this is really

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.510 
using this as a base now this is really
disappointing<00:00:30.269> to<00:00:30.840> me<00:00:31.230> I<00:00:31.740> only<00:00:32.009> got<00:00:32.189> this<00:00:32.340> for

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
disappointing to me I only got this for

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.330 
disappointing to me I only got this for
78<00:00:33.059> cents<00:00:33.450> so<00:00:33.719> it<00:00:33.899> you<00:00:34.530> know<00:00:34.680> I'm<00:00:34.800> not<00:00:35.100> really<00:00:35.219> a

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
78 cents so it you know I'm not really a

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.910 
78 cents so it you know I'm not really a
regret<00:00:35.820> for<00:00:36.059> me<00:00:36.180> I<00:00:36.390> just<00:00:37.020> it<00:00:37.290> isn't<00:00:37.590> one<00:00:37.739> of<00:00:37.800> the

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
regret for me I just it isn't one of the

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.220 
regret for me I just it isn't one of the
best<00:00:38.100> products<00:00:38.489> I've<00:00:38.670> tried<00:00:39.090> the<00:00:39.690> only<00:00:39.899> reason

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
best products I've tried the only reason

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.780 
best products I've tried the only reason
that<00:00:40.260> I<00:00:40.410> actually<00:00:40.739> kind<00:00:41.160> of<00:00:41.250> like<00:00:41.460> it<00:00:41.640> is

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
that I actually kind of like it is

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.850 
that I actually kind of like it is
because<00:00:42.030> I<00:00:42.570> don't<00:00:43.110> have<00:00:43.350> any<00:00:43.559> glitter

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
because I don't have any glitter

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.459 
because I don't have any glitter
adhesive<00:00:44.070> or<00:00:44.910> anything<00:00:45.059> like<00:00:45.270> that<00:00:45.469> for

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
adhesive or anything like that for

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.000 
adhesive or anything like that for
holding<00:00:47.430> like<00:00:47.760> loose<00:00:48.090> glitter<00:00:48.450> shadows<00:00:49.079> to<00:00:49.860> my

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
holding like loose glitter shadows to my

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.549 
holding like loose glitter shadows to my
eyelids<00:00:50.460> and<00:00:50.730> this<00:00:50.910> works<00:00:51.239> for<00:00:51.420> that<00:00:51.750> but<00:00:52.350> it

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
eyelids and this works for that but it

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.700 
eyelids and this works for that but it
just<00:00:52.590> creases<00:00:53.309> really<00:00:54.210> terribly<00:00:55.079> and<00:00:55.320> if

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
just creases really terribly and if

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.500 
just creases really terribly and if
you're<00:00:55.860> also<00:00:56.010> really<00:00:56.309> sparse<00:00:56.879> like<00:00:57.360> you

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
you're also really sparse like you

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.240 
you're also really sparse like you
cannot<00:00:57.780> just<00:00:58.020> use<00:00:58.079> this<00:00:58.289> on<00:00:58.500> its<00:00:58.680> own<00:00:58.800> it

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
cannot just use this on its own it

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.160 
cannot just use this on its own it
really<00:00:59.820> won't<00:00:59.969> do<00:01:00.149> anything<00:01:00.390> it'll<00:01:00.960> just

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
really won't do anything it'll just

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.490 
really won't do anything it'll just
crease<00:01:01.530> your<00:01:01.859> eye<00:01:01.920> makeup<00:01:02.690> it's<00:01:03.690> just<00:01:04.110> really

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
crease your eye makeup it's just really

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.140 
crease your eye makeup it's just really
terrible<00:01:04.979> I<00:01:05.100> don't<00:01:05.129> recommend<00:01:05.519> using<00:01:05.790> this<00:01:05.970> on

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
terrible I don't recommend using this on

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.000 
terrible I don't recommend using this on
top<00:01:06.510> of<00:01:06.630> any<00:01:06.810> eyeshadows<00:01:07.200> they'll<00:01:07.409> just<00:01:07.590> ruin

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
top of any eyeshadows they'll just ruin

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:08.539 
top of any eyeshadows they'll just ruin
your<00:01:08.130> makeup

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
your makeup

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.179 
your makeup
and<00:01:08.820> basically<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.450> claims<00:01:09.840> say<00:01:10.409> intensely

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
and basically the claims say intensely

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.000 
and basically the claims say intensely
sparkly<00:01:11.970> glitter<00:01:12.360> illustrious<00:01:13.260> smooth

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
sparkly glitter illustrious smooth

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.609 
sparkly glitter illustrious smooth
formula<00:01:14.880> so<00:01:15.509> I<00:01:15.540> really<00:01:15.900> don't<00:01:16.049> agree<00:01:16.170> with<00:01:16.409> any

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
formula so I really don't agree with any

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.410 
formula so I really don't agree with any
of<00:01:16.740> these<00:01:16.799> claims<00:01:17.250> it's<00:01:17.610> not<00:01:17.700> intensely

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
of these claims it's not intensely

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.320 
of these claims it's not intensely
sparkly<00:01:19.110> so<00:01:20.009> this<00:01:20.369> is<00:01:20.490> what<00:01:20.610> it<00:01:20.700> looks<00:01:20.909> like<00:01:21.119> it

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
sparkly so this is what it looks like it

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.210 
sparkly so this is what it looks like it
looks<00:01:21.509> exactly<00:01:21.689> like<00:01:22.080> all<00:01:22.530> of<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:22.950> wet<00:01:23.100> and

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
looks exactly like all of the wet and

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:23.570 
looks exactly like all of the wet and
wild

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
wild

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.320 
wild
single<00:01:24.060> eyeshadows<00:01:24.659> same<00:01:25.470> size<00:01:25.799> and<00:01:26.460> died

opens<00:01:27.780> in<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:27.990> same<00:01:28.229> way<00:01:28.500> and<00:01:29.040> you<00:01:29.579> can<00:01:29.700> just

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
opens in the same way and you can just

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.060 
opens in the same way and you can just
hit<00:01:29.909> the<00:01:30.030> glitter<00:01:30.299> in<00:01:30.479> there<00:01:30.740> so<00:01:31.740> I'm<00:01:31.890> just

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
hit the glitter in there so I'm just

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.859 
hit the glitter in there so I'm just
going<00:01:32.220> to<00:01:32.280> be<00:01:32.400> applying<00:01:32.790> this<00:01:33.150> to<00:01:33.329> my<00:01:33.450> eyelids

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
going to be applying this to my eyelids

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.859 
going to be applying this to my eyelids
and<00:01:34.380> you<00:01:35.280> can<00:01:35.400> see<00:01:35.579> how<00:01:35.700> sparse<00:01:36.210> that<00:01:36.299> is<00:01:36.689> I'll

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
and you can see how sparse that is I'll

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:37.910 
and you can see how sparse that is I'll
swatch<00:01:37.140> it<00:01:37.320> for<00:01:37.350> you<00:01:37.470> guys

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
swatch it for you guys

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.429 
swatch it for you guys
it<00:01:38.040> is<00:01:38.430> extremely<00:01:39.390> sparse<00:01:40.020> I<00:01:40.200> don't<00:01:40.320> know<00:01:40.380> if

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
it is extremely sparse I don't know if

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.889 
it is extremely sparse I don't know if
you<00:01:40.500> can<00:01:40.650> see<00:01:40.920> that<00:01:41.130> I<00:01:41.460> mean<00:01:41.909> not<00:01:42.450> much<00:01:42.570> glitter

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
you can see that I mean not much glitter

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:52.960 
you can see that I mean not much glitter
actually<00:01:43.320> comes<00:01:43.590> off<00:01:43.860> when<00:01:44.220> you<00:01:44.340> swatch<00:01:44.610> it

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:52.970 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:02:04.630 

you

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.090 

so<00:02:05.390> one<00:02:05.570> thing<00:02:05.720> I<00:02:05.840> noticed<00:02:06.230> about<00:02:06.320> the<00:02:06.560> formula

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.100 
so one thing I noticed about the formula

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.160 
so one thing I noticed about the formula
was<00:02:07.310> it's<00:02:07.610> very<00:02:07.850> sticky<00:02:08.450> when<00:02:08.690> it<00:02:08.810> goes<00:02:08.960> in<00:02:09.080> the

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170

lids it's extremely sticky and I don't

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.580 
lids it's extremely sticky and I don't
really<00:02:12.830> like<00:02:13.040> that<00:02:13.220> so<00:02:14.150> basically<00:02:14.900> I'm<00:02:15.380> going

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
really like that so basically I'm going

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.680 
really like that so basically I'm going
to<00:02:15.680> show<00:02:15.770> you<00:02:15.950> how<00:02:16.370> it<00:02:16.490> works<00:02:16.760> using<00:02:17.270> eyeshadow

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690

on<00:02:18.140> top<00:02:18.440> of<00:02:18.590> it<00:02:18.740> because<00:02:19.340> that's<00:02:19.430> what<00:02:19.640> I<00:02:19.670> think

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
on top of it because that's what I think

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:21.670 
on top of it because that's what I think
it'd<00:02:20.150> be<00:02:20.180> the<00:02:20.540> best<00:02:20.810> for<00:02:21.140> if<00:02:21.230> I<00:02:21.320> was<00:02:21.440> going<00:02:21.620> to

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
it'd be the best for if I was going to

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.830 
it'd be the best for if I was going to
pick<00:02:21.830> one<00:02:22.070> thing<00:02:22.400> would<00:02:22.910> be<00:02:23.150> an<00:02:23.360> eyeshadow

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
pick one thing would be an eyeshadow

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:32.290 
pick one thing would be an eyeshadow

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:01.740 
so that's how it works with eyeshadow

so that's how it works with eyeshadow
top<00:03:01.950> of<00:03:02.100> it<00:03:02.400> I<00:03:02.430> used<00:03:03.120> the<00:03:03.420> Revlon<00:03:03.900> a<00:03:03.930> diamond

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
top of it I used the Revlon a diamond

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.730 
top of it I used the Revlon a diamond
Alice<00:03:05.040> glitter<00:03:05.790> loose<00:03:06.600> glitter<00:03:06.870> shadow<00:03:07.350> and

Alice glitter loose glitter shadow and

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:09.710 
Alice glitter loose glitter shadow and
they<00:03:08.160> basically<00:03:08.310> just<00:03:08.670> put<00:03:08.850> that<00:03:08.970> on<00:03:09.210> top<00:03:09.660> of

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
they basically just put that on top of

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.080 
they basically just put that on top of
this<00:03:10.440> and<00:03:10.680> it<00:03:10.800> works<00:03:11.040> nicely<00:03:11.520> as<00:03:11.790> a<00:03:11.850> base

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
this and it works nicely as a base

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:15.620 
this and it works nicely as a base
except<00:03:12.990> it<00:03:13.140> creases<00:03:13.770> really<00:03:14.430> quickly<00:03:15.180> so<00:03:15.450> as

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
except it creases really quickly so as

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.630 
except it creases really quickly so as
soon<00:03:15.720> as<00:03:15.810> you<00:03:15.900> put<00:03:16.050> it<00:03:16.080> on<00:03:16.290> like<00:03:16.920> but<00:03:17.370> five

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
minutes after that or maybe even less

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:21.860 
minutes after that or maybe even less
you're<00:03:20.430> gonna<00:03:20.520> notice<00:03:20.730> creasing<00:03:21.420> and<00:03:21.630> that's

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:36.240

different one I guess this would be a
product<00:03:36.660> you<00:03:36.720> could<00:03:36.810> get<00:03:37.050> but<00:03:37.500> I<00:03:37.530> don't<00:03:38.010> really
