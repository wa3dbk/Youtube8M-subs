00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 and the million dollar question is that we 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.060
 we want to pry we do not want 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:10.019
 no transan and drugs or weapons 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:13.500
 nor of sexuality 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:15.059
 good because simply so 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.369
 next direct as I told them 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.810
 I was voting my computer the 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.539
 trash for anything I did not know 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.220
 what to do but I want to be very raw and 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.380
 neither scandalize people because 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.880
 I repeat that the internet is not that but yes 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.710
 It is true that it is very easy to buy 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.869
 a gun for a thousand euros for example 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.550
 between 1600 euros there are forums not you 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.500
 contacts by a seller and you the 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.390
 shopping there is all the drug you want 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.579
 also also directly to your home is 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.980
 a little the service like the one that buys 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.750
 on ebay and unfortunately there is a lot 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.360
 child pornography there are forums 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.160
 child pornography which pedophiles 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.690
 promote their experience as if it were a 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.120
 car forum that is truly is 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.460
 they scandalize you the concept of seeing them 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.170
 talk about their experiences counting 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.760
 if you go to this country be careful with this 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.199
 with a naturalness that really 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.180
 it impresses I think that somehow 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.990
 enjoy impunity we are content 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.290
 from the correct general network 

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:06.490
 ok right there was what you 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:09.370
 you can find but what I had 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:11.860
 pending that can happen to you if you 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:13.150
 you get there starting from something of how 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.670
 offer credit cards these 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:18.610
 people is why getting in there can 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:20.830
 being a product of fraud can also be 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:22.840
 product that they take material let's say 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:24.640
