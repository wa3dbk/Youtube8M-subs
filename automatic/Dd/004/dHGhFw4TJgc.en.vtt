00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.330
 welcome to follow 24 me 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.790
 show you today condemned criminal room 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.859
 is seaworthy origins shit done well the 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.260
 Beyond simulator condemned was 2003 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.190
 from sega for the gamecube and that 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.719
 macbook pro developed 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.190
 because the advanced graphics and the 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:15.960
 particularly visually innovative experiences 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.580
 realistic only on these devices 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.990
 could be implemented despite the partly 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.850
 violent sexual acts was the 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.170
 play released from 12 years 

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:24.750
 probably because the best ten censored 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.220
 have been the frostbite 4 engine 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.510
 based death simulator was created by 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.250
 segas boss personal order 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.570
 given that Hunter 2003 massive 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.520
 money problems had been in the game 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.390
 Advertising placed around the 90210 if you can 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.950
 the hits dollar expensive project 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.329
 to be able to finance in germany 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.890
 The game was due to this massive 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.020
 Advertising confiscated nationwide 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.879
 act a man is playing them 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.290
 Siegesmund an Italian postman 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.120
 who has his job and carry it out 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.500
 an oversized package shot 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.329
 will sweden between life and death 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.770
 he gets a call from the top and 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.300
 gets the order for order in 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.920
 spirited and the real world too 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:57.329
 Worrying as a half-breed, it is just 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.829
 it is possible to influence both worlds 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.719
 There is chaos in the city the people 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.699
 on the ubiquitous advertising for one 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:06.019
 New product fell into the sun 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.019
 unfortunately triggers diarrhea 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:09.560
 it's all over 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.120
 block advertising board 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.410
 this can be done by dying 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:14.180
 and collect metal objects and 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:15.500
 so that energy is earned for advertising blocks 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.090
 as you can see here copied 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.710
 the game clearly elements from the film 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.480
 ghost message from sam as well as the 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:22.160
 video game silent hill origins was there 

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:23.810
 already deserves the title 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:25.040
 selena gomez himself says he is waiting 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:30.590
 now I met her and 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:32.090
 interview game courage there is one 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.070
 singleplayer campaign and the dlc 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.510
 fire angel in which a real fire 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:36.680
 and the fire between the legs of 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:38.330
 people can control 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.280
 Unfortunately that is neither sexy nor special 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:42.230
 fun and the singleplayer campaign has 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.460
 me an incredible blemish you can 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:45.560
 Don `t save 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:47.420
 the main mission about 220 hours and 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.800
 You can never save this review 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.720
 I had to do my gang two 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:54.070
 go through for months who comes 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:56.270
 on so what peter minus point ck 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:56.870
 Leveldesign the level brimming over 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.550
 advertising 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:59.810
 You can clearly feel the financial crisis of Sister 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:01.280
 and unfortunately , did not get very creative 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.990
 it even deals with it 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.830
 advertising breaks between each level 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:07.780
 sections where not many 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:08.450
 the darkest places explore each 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.069
 corner 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.840
 was great what did you think 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:13.310
 a few easter eggs play another 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.050
 But there is nothing relevant 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:16.010
 except maybe nikulin fire extinguishers 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:19.160
 control 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:21.140
 the controls are weird and running 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.190
 go works perfectly but before 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.569
 you investigate something or 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:25.430
 You have to be able to attack on the 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:26.900
 wait for action and then the a 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:28.610
 press the button that delays the 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:30.140
 Of course, game flow is extreme and in the channel 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:36.049
 level is driving the game on the 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:37.849
 tip of this balancing 

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:39.709
 Here was just the action buttons as 

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:41.599
 special feature announced the 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:43.220
 Action buttons alone was my ideas and 

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:44.510
 is one of the best features in the game 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.709
 Add to that the control 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:47.120
 over the character loses against 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:49.250
 it is no longer anywhere 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.630
 controllable considers and beats up 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:54.440
 the packages once his job as 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:56.209
 Postman hated counting gas graphics 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.860
 and sound graphics and sound are the 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:59.810
 single pluses throughout the game 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:01.760
 the frostbite engine are just smith 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:03.230
 especially in the cutscenes of the sound 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:05.239
 The game is in series and can be 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:07.540
 loose with current 521 patient play 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:10.010
 measure games 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.989
 is not that the hammer and the music 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:14.650
 they just have some spirits for the game 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:14.650
 Committed 

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:20.740
 everything done right here 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:22.720
 Compatibility The first part was one 

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:23.920
 explosive gamecube title and became first 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.420
 after a year on the mac book 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.740
 made available there are now 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:28.090
 Two stable running pocket watch 

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:29.440
 versions but they are also in the beta 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:31.240
 by the way, the train has to be on this train 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.650
 new packaging mentions the macbook pro 

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:34.840
 versions come in second sight 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:36.400
 packs no idea that pro games are there 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:41.110
 but has ridden that is another 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:42.700
 minus vertical insane that 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:44.500
 game gets from me two and a half of 69 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.970
 points a point rather to the graphic and 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:48.040
 sound and a half point for this 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:50.220
 making easter egg with two minuses 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:52.600
 it's half a point for content kreml 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:54.220
 and I met shigeru miyamoto 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:56.560
 and he has as proof this photo of 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:58.540
 market behind the camera us government 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.190
 and gives my opinion to all 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:01.480
 play 100 percent 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:02.890
 i think i need more backup 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:04.420
 first do not go next 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:05.590
 I probably have help mario kart 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:07.240
 heard that with one of the best shooter 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:09.070
 stay tuned this year with expensive 

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:10.540
 friends nothing of these values then 

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:12.760
 Do you always have an advantage when buying 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:14.740
 the newest games make it better for you 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:15.490
 I can criticize the game of changement 

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:17.530
 do not understand 

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:19.420
 So I think it's pretty big 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:20.860
 We already have almost 16 pieces 

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:22.690
 sold we are still looking for 

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:24.430
