00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:03.220
 good side let's talk about going combined operations 

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:05.640
 where 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.119
 will be incorporated 

00:00:08.119 --> 00:00:10.279
 per hundred non-mixed numbers 

00:00:10.279 --> 00:00:12.079
 in this case 

00:00:12.079 --> 00:00:15.079
 let's keep in mind the following 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.680
 let's think about what we need to add 3 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:22.880
 plus a quarter 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:24.140
 plus 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:25.780
 2 whole 

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:28.649
 A doctor 

00:00:28.649 --> 00:00:31.009
 in this particular case 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:34.090
 we have to take them all these years 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:35.090
 values 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:37.410
 to a single form 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.410
 the formula with the ideal form in this case would be that of a fraction 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:46.890
 in this case we are going to convert into 3 in the fraction for it you can 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.310
 add mosul 

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:53.310
 the barracks a quarter is still fourth 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.020
 and in this case as in a previous session between what we do 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:03.470
 imply two by 8 and add a 3 2 by 8 16 +1 17 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:06.020
 17 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:08.750
 eighth 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:13.680
 Once this is done, what we do is leave, I do not see how to get the minimum 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.320
 common multiple to the denominators in this case 1 4 and 8 but not only 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.430
 four and eight then 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.590
 are the ones to work 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.310
 but we already know what 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:27.070
 Half stands out 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.070
 half again 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.840
 half 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.840
 2 for 2 4 4 for 2 8 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.940
 8s the least common multiple 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:41.870
 8 of vigo 1 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:45.130
 8 of course the 24 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:47.580
 8 of vigo 4 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.990
 I say to the two peoples 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:53.980
 8 d much 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:56.980
 one for 17 17 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:04.560
 then we add the values ​​we have in the denominator 24 +2 26 Mar 17 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.160
 43 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.860
 three we will have that this is 43 eighths 

00:02:10.909 --> 00:02:13.279
 let's make a second example 

00:02:13.279 --> 00:02:16.299
 of this situation 

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:19.299
 we honor here 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:24.429
 and let's think 

00:02:24.429 --> 00:02:26.309
 we have a census 

00:02:26.309 --> 00:02:29.569
 we need are marlene 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:31.259
 three fifths 

00:02:31.259 --> 00:02:34.749
 multiplied by was made 

00:02:34.749 --> 00:02:37.749
 plus 

00:02:38.279 --> 00:02:40.089
 an eighth 

00:02:40.089 --> 00:02:43.089
 divided 

00:02:44.119 --> 00:02:46.519
 so 

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:49.639
 we do not think we're going to realize 

00:02:49.639 --> 00:02:52.440
 in this case, to convert everything 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.969
 abounds 

00:02:54.969 --> 00:02:58.930
 same way in this case a basket is still a sixth 

00:02:59.699 --> 00:03:00.699
 plus 

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:02.689
 three fifths 

00:03:02.689 --> 00:03:05.519
 this service as to convert into fraction 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:08.379
 for that, it adds not only no 

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:10.389
 when each one 

00:03:10.389 --> 00:03:12.069
 it's still the eighth 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:15.539
 of or four we connect the infraction for that 

00:03:15.539 --> 00:03:17.499
 four on 1 sept 

00:03:17.499 --> 00:03:20.119
 after that you can 

00:03:20.119 --> 00:03:25.459
 we made multiplications and divisions as we had been developing it on 3 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:27.639
 3 for 6 18 

00:03:27.639 --> 00:03:30.829
 5 for 1 to 5 

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:34.659
 in the case of division b and in which it was a cross product in this case 

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:37.999
 let's multiply one by one 

00:03:37.999 --> 00:03:39.339
 eight for four 

00:03:39.339 --> 00:03:41.949
 the interface 

00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:46.669
 once done that as the denominators 6 synco and 32 

00:03:46.669 --> 00:03:49.669
 and it is broken down into prime factors 

00:03:51.029 --> 00:03:52.529
 pita of 6 3 

00:03:52.529 --> 00:03:55.790
 half of 32 16 5 is going 

00:03:57.409 --> 00:03:58.459
 half 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:01.459
 of 16 8 

00:04:03.859 --> 00:04:05.389
 among them five 

00:04:05.389 --> 00:04:06.769
 with descents 

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:09.939
 half of 8 4 

00:04:09.939 --> 00:04:12.529
 like 5 and 3 

00:04:12.529 --> 00:04:15.529
 4 2 

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:19.199
 5 and 3 we follow it down involved 

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:22.430
 as the 5 we go down the 3 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:24.639
 you third of three 

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:25.900
 until 5 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:28.779
 fifth in 5 obama 

00:04:28.779 --> 00:04:32.509
 all all the values ​​that are found aer made this bar in that 

00:04:32.509 --> 00:04:40.699
 case without cuts 15 by 2 30 by 2 60 by 2 120 by two 2 40 by all table 80 

00:04:40.699 --> 00:04:43.279
 we want again if with 3 15 

00:04:43.279 --> 00:04:44.919
 2 30 

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:50.899
 porto 60 by 2 120 by two 2 40 by 2 400 so that the procedure escobar 

00:04:53.289 --> 00:04:55.139
 4 80 

00:04:55.139 --> 00:04:57.509
 proceed to go between 6 

00:04:57.509 --> 00:05:00.509
 is doubt 80 80 for 1 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:05.199
 there was no 

00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:08.300
 it is necessary sometimes has given them operations between them 

00:05:08.819 --> 00:05:11.039
 how can you sometimes pay them 

00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:13.559
 operations well 

00:05:13.559 --> 00:05:15.610
 4 80 injured five 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:18.610
 ps our common vision is updated 

00:05:19.279 --> 00:05:22.499
 percent and 9 for 5 45 to 48 3 

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:24.939
 for one hundrerd 

00:05:24.939 --> 00:05:27.889
 is between these times 

00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:29.389
 and there will be no more than 

00:05:29.389 --> 00:05:34.340
 is 96 we proceed to multiply it by 18 8 by 6 48 a.m. 4 

00:05:35.789 --> 00:05:37.680
 eight for 9 72 

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:39.889
 and 4 76 

00:05:39.889 --> 00:05:42.889
 one for 6 6 one way for 9 

00:05:44.499 --> 00:05:47.680
 we are 8 6 and 6 12 

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:48.520
 madonna 

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:50.699
 9 and 7 16 I was 

00:05:50.699 --> 00:05:51.590
 17 

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:54.919
 1722 

00:05:54.919 --> 00:05:56.779
 finally in 

00:05:56.779 --> 00:05:59.439
 we made the division 

00:05:59.439 --> 00:06:02.439
 let's delete here 6 we have the result 

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:06.099
 4 80 

00:06:06.099 --> 00:06:08.689
 He directed 32 

00:06:08.689 --> 00:06:11.619
 the free inventors 

00:06:11.619 --> 00:06:12.969
 one for 2 2 

00:06:12.969 --> 00:06:15.569
 to eight 6 one by 3 3 

00:06:15.569 --> 00:06:16.900
 to four 

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:18.379
 let's go from 0 

00:06:18.379 --> 00:06:21.379
 39 160 so they are five times 

00:06:21.979 --> 00:06:25.339
 5 for 2 days there is 0 5 for 3 15 

00:06:25.339 --> 00:06:28.279
 It has 16 countries 

00:06:28.279 --> 00:06:31.110
 psc and 15 in lund we avoid by 

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:34.110
 1 trained 

00:06:35.409 --> 00:06:37.669
 let's go up 

00:06:37.669 --> 00:06:40.770
 in this case 80 +15 95 

00:06:42.279 --> 00:06:45.189
 then it is 

00:06:45.189 --> 00:06:50.269
 the 95 plus 1728 in this case 

00:06:50.819 --> 00:06:54.059
 would give me a total of me 

00:06:54.059 --> 00:06:56.629
 800 

00:06:56.629 --> 00:06:59.629
 efe 

00:07:00.479 --> 00:07:03.099
 2. 3 

00:07:03.099 --> 00:07:06.099
 chis 5 13 

00:07:06.689 --> 00:07:09.210
 of that evil we are going to review it 

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:12.270
 then 80 + 15 95 

00:07:13.009 --> 00:07:16.039
 it's like adding 1070 28 more percent 

00:07:16.039 --> 00:07:21.039
 and we took away 5 3 thousand 828 and we removed 5 1823 

00:07:22.409 --> 00:07:23.860
 4 8 

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:25.699
 damaged piece answer 

00:07:25.699 --> 00:07:27.770
 and with this we conclude 

00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:30.339
 combined operations 

00:07:30.339 --> 00:07:33.389
 with mixed numbers infractions 

00:07:33.389 --> 00:07:34.400
 that are well boys
