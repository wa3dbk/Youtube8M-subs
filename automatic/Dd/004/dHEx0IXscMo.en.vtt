from an order I made a few weeks ago by
now<00:00:11.639> probably<00:00:11.940> and<00:00:12.420> it<00:00:12.780> was<00:00:12.869> the<00:00:13.020> one<00:00:13.200> where<00:00:14.010> i

00:00:14.029 --> 00:00:14.039 
now probably and it was the one where i

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:17.779 
now probably and it was the one where i
unbox<00:00:14.760> the<00:00:14.910> pyraminx<00:00:15.299> and<00:00:15.830> the<00:00:16.830> wit<00:00:17.279> to<00:00:17.310> and

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
unbox the pyraminx and the wit to and

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.870 
unbox the pyraminx and the wit to and
the<00:00:18.300> mf8<00:00:18.720> megaminx<00:00:19.260> they<00:00:20.100> didn't<00:00:20.400> have<00:00:20.609> the

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
the mf8 megaminx they didn't have the

the mf8 megaminx they didn't have the
disc<00:00:21.539> you<00:00:21.750> at<00:00:21.990> the<00:00:22.199> time<00:00:22.380> and<00:00:22.589> so<00:00:23.220> it<00:00:23.519> is<00:00:23.640> now

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789

but I did win and I'm very very grateful
for<00:00:32.160> that<00:00:32.610> originally<00:00:33.450> I<00:00:33.510> was<00:00:33.600> going<00:00:33.660> to<00:00:33.870> get<00:00:33.960> a

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:33.990 
for that originally I was going to get a

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:36.590 
for that originally I was going to get a
v-cube<00:00:34.290> seven<00:00:34.770> but<00:00:35.190> I<00:00:35.400> thought<00:00:35.640> I<00:00:36.000> already<00:00:36.449> had

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
v-cube seven but I thought I already had

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.110 
v-cube seven but I thought I already had
one<00:00:36.989> and<00:00:37.250> she<00:00:38.250> can<00:00:38.399> use<00:00:38.520> that<00:00:38.640> for<00:00:38.699> a<00:00:38.850> different

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
one and she can use that for a different

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.990 
one and she can use that for a different
giveaway<00:00:39.539> so<00:00:39.600> instead<00:00:40.399> she<00:00:41.399> offered<00:00:41.670> me<00:00:41.699> a

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
giveaway so instead she offered me a

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
website and I picked two cubes also from

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.930 
website and I picked two cubes also from
the<00:00:48.960> cubicle<00:00:49.440> so<00:00:49.949> let's<00:00:50.430> get<00:00:50.609> to<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:50.820> unboxing

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
the cubicle so let's get to the unboxing

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.400 
the cubicle so let's get to the unboxing
first<00:00:51.930> let's<00:00:52.289> do<00:00:52.590> this<00:00:52.710> one<00:00:52.980> since<00:00:54.199> this<00:00:55.199> is

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
first let's do this one since this is

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:13.340 
first let's do this one since this is
way<00:00:55.800> overdue<00:01:11.270> so<00:01:12.270> we<00:01:12.390> have<00:01:12.480> a<00:01:12.540> cube<00:01:12.840> here<00:01:13.110> and

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
way overdue so we have a cube here and

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:14.420 
way overdue so we have a cube here and
it<00:01:13.440> looks<00:01:13.590> like<00:01:13.650> we<00:01:13.830> have<00:01:13.890> nothing<00:01:14.010> else<00:01:14.280> in

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
it looks like we have nothing else in

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.780 
it looks like we have nothing else in
the<00:01:14.520> bag<00:01:14.960> not<00:01:15.960> even<00:01:16.110> a<00:01:16.440> business<00:01:17.190> card<00:01:17.430> which

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
the bag not even a business card which

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.070 
the bag not even a business card which
seems<00:01:18.090> unusual<00:01:18.690> and<00:01:19.760> it<00:01:20.760> looks<00:01:20.970> like<00:01:21.030> it<00:01:21.450> is<00:01:21.510> a

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
seems unusual and it looks like it is a

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.030 
seems unusual and it looks like it is a
China<00:01:22.710> cue<00:01:23.160> club<00:01:23.430> mf8<00:01:24.270> super<00:01:24.630> square<00:01:24.870> one<00:01:25.260> box

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
China cue club mf8 super square one box

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.700 
China cue club mf8 super square one box
what<00:01:26.850> it<00:01:27.180> shouldn't<00:01:27.600> be<00:01:27.750> a<00:01:27.780> super<00:01:28.260> square<00:01:28.500> one

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
what it shouldn't be a super square one

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.000 
what it shouldn't be a super square one
it<00:01:29.340> should<00:01:29.550> just<00:01:29.640> be<00:01:29.760> a<00:01:30.090> regular<00:01:30.330> square<00:01:30.780> one

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:31.010 
it should just be a regular square one

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:33.560 
it should just be a regular square one
you<00:01:32.010> don't<00:01:32.220> care<00:01:32.340> about<00:01:32.400> the<00:01:32.580> box<00:01:32.880> so<00:01:33.420> let's

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
you don't care about the box so let's

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:39.940 
you don't care about the box so let's
open<00:01:33.810> this<00:01:34.110> up<00:01:34.400> and<00:01:36.050> we<00:01:37.050> have<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:37.620> q<00:01:37.880> and

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 
open this up and we have the q and

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.610 
open this up and we have the q and
that's<00:01:40.950> it<00:01:41.160> so<00:01:41.820> nothing<00:01:42.360> else<00:01:42.510> this<00:01:43.230> is<00:01:43.410> just

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:43.620 
that's it so nothing else this is just

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:46.430 
that's it so nothing else this is just
the<00:01:43.830> cutout<00:01:44.190> presumably<00:01:45.030> from<00:01:45.510> this<00:01:46.020> right

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:46.440 
the cutout presumably from this right

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.610 
the cutout presumably from this right
here<00:01:46.910> so<00:01:47.910> let's<00:01:48.150> set<00:01:48.660> this<00:01:48.810> aside<00:01:48.990> and<00:01:49.470> let's

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:49.620 
here so let's set this aside and let's

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:59.970 
here so let's set this aside and let's
open<00:01:49.860> the<00:01:49.980> second<00:01:50.280> package

00:01:59.970 --> 00:01:59.980 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:06.400 

so<00:02:00.980> here<00:02:01.430> we<00:02:02.360> have<00:02:03.400> another<00:02:04.400> puzzle<00:02:05.390> this<00:02:06.020> is<00:02:06.200> a

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:06.410 
so here we have another puzzle this is a

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:08.230 
so here we have another puzzle this is a
different<00:02:06.800> box<00:02:07.010> which<00:02:07.280> is<00:02:07.430> interesting<00:02:08.030> since

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:08.240 
different box which is interesting since

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:15.730 
different box which is interesting since
it's<00:02:08.720> the<00:02:08.810> same<00:02:09.020> puzzle<00:02:13.240> this<00:02:14.240> is<00:02:14.420> also<00:02:14.630> an<00:02:15.140> MF

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:15.740 
it's the same puzzle this is also an MF

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:19.720 
it's the same puzzle this is also an MF
eight<00:02:15.920> square<00:02:16.310> one<00:02:17.500> this<00:02:18.500> one<00:02:18.680> is<00:02:18.800> in<00:02:18.920> white<00:02:19.160> so

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
eight square one this one is in white so

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:20.710 
eight square one this one is in white so
you're<00:02:19.850> probably<00:02:19.940> wondering<00:02:20.150> why<00:02:20.360> I<00:02:20.390> got<00:02:20.570> two

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
you're probably wondering why I got two

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.110 
you're probably wondering why I got two
of<00:02:20.870> them<00:02:20.990> I<00:02:21.200> wanted<00:02:22.130> to<00:02:22.190> learn<00:02:22.430> square<00:02:22.730> one<00:02:22.910> for

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
of them I wanted to learn square one for

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.250 
of them I wanted to learn square one for
Minnesota<00:02:23.690> open<00:02:24.340> 2012<00:02:26.080> unfortunately<00:02:27.080> they

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
Minnesota open 2012 unfortunately they

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:28.570 
Minnesota open 2012 unfortunately they
didn't<00:02:27.500> have<00:02:27.650> the<00:02:27.800> black<00:02:27.980> one<00:02:28.100> in<00:02:28.220> stock<00:02:28.400> when

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
didn't have the black one in stock when

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.040 
didn't have the black one in stock when
I<00:02:28.640> ordered<00:02:29.000> it<00:02:29.150> and<00:02:29.270> I<00:02:29.420> didn't<00:02:29.660> know<00:02:29.720> how<00:02:29.900> long

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.050 
I ordered it and I didn't know how long

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:32.170 
I ordered it and I didn't know how long
it<00:02:30.110> would<00:02:30.260> take<00:02:30.320> so<00:02:30.770> I<00:02:31.010> decided<00:02:31.820> to<00:02:32.030> get<00:02:32.120> a

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
it would take so I decided to get a

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.000 
it would take so I decided to get a
white<00:02:32.390> one<00:02:32.600> and<00:02:32.870> it<00:02:33.260> just<00:02:33.440> so<00:02:33.530> happens<00:02:33.920> that

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
white one and it just so happens that

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:35.410 
white one and it just so happens that
both<00:02:34.220> of<00:02:34.280> them<00:02:34.430> got<00:02:34.640> shipped<00:02:34.850> out<00:02:34.940> on<00:02:35.000> the<00:02:35.180> same

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
both of them got shipped out on the same

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.290 
both of them got shipped out on the same
day<00:02:35.450> so<00:02:36.040> now<00:02:37.040> i<00:02:37.070> have<00:02:37.190> two<00:02:37.400> square<00:02:37.640> ones<00:02:37.850> which

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:38.300 
day so now i have two square ones which

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:39.730 
day so now i have two square ones which
is<00:02:38.450> fine<00:02:38.660> because<00:02:38.870> now<00:02:39.110> i<00:02:39.140> can<00:02:39.350> just<00:02:39.470> choose

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:39.740 
is fine because now i can just choose

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:41.830 
is fine because now i can just choose
whichever<00:02:40.280> one<00:02:40.520> I<00:02:40.550> like<00:02:40.790> more<00:02:41.030> for<00:02:41.510> the

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
whichever one I like more for the

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.600 
whichever one I like more for the
competition<00:02:42.140> and<00:02:43.540> lastly<00:02:44.540> we<00:02:45.350> have<00:02:45.380> this<00:02:46.250> and

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610 
competition and lastly we have this and

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:48.460 
competition and lastly we have this and
it<00:02:47.450> looks<00:02:47.600> like<00:02:47.660> there's<00:02:47.870> no<00:02:47.959> business<00:02:48.350> card

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470 
it looks like there's no business card

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:50.170 
it looks like there's no business card
in<00:02:48.590> this<00:02:48.770> either<00:02:49.010> so<00:02:49.280> maybe<00:02:49.400> they<00:02:49.610> ran<00:02:49.790> out<00:02:49.850> or

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
in this either so maybe they ran out or

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.449 
in this either so maybe they ran out or
they're<00:02:50.840> just<00:02:50.870> not<00:02:51.470> using<00:02:51.830> it<00:02:51.920> anymore<00:02:51.980> I

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:52.459 
they're just not using it anymore I

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:54.670 
they're just not using it anymore I
don't<00:02:52.970> really<00:02:53.090> know<00:02:53.330> but<00:02:53.959> let's<00:02:54.140> unbox<00:02:54.350> this

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
don't really know but let's unbox this

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.900 
don't really know but let's unbox this
this<00:02:54.950> is<00:02:55.130> a<00:02:55.480> type<00:02:56.480> C<00:02:56.780> for<00:02:57.350> I<00:02:57.790> refrain<00:02:58.790> from

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 
this is a type C for I refrain from

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:00.430 
this is a type C for I refrain from
saying<00:02:59.120> c4<00:02:59.630> since<00:02:59.870> that<00:03:00.020> sounds<00:03:00.230> like<00:03:00.350> an

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 
saying c4 since that sounds like an

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:03.280 
saying c4 since that sounds like an
explosive<00:03:01.010> this<00:03:01.430> is<00:03:01.550> a<00:03:01.580> whit<00:03:01.880> long<00:03:02.239> and<00:03:02.750> while

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.290 
explosive this is a whit long and while

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:05.680 
explosive this is a whit long and while
these<00:03:03.470> stickers<00:03:03.910> look<00:03:04.910> very<00:03:05.209> different<00:03:05.390> than

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:05.690 
these stickers look very different than

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:10.540 
these stickers look very different than
what<00:03:05.900> they<00:03:06.050> do<00:03:06.110> in<00:03:06.470> videos<00:03:08.709> this<00:03:09.709> is<00:03:09.890> very<00:03:10.400> very

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:10.550 
what they do in videos this is very very

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:12.370 
what they do in videos this is very very
exciting<00:03:11.090> I'll<00:03:11.390> put<00:03:11.570> this<00:03:11.660> aside<00:03:11.810> since<00:03:12.170> I'm

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:12.380 
exciting I'll put this aside since I'm

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:14.710 
exciting I'll put this aside since I'm
most<00:03:12.590> excited<00:03:12.739> for<00:03:13.040> this<00:03:13.299> let's<00:03:14.299> just<00:03:14.330> do<00:03:14.540> some

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 
most excited for this let's just do some

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.420 
most excited for this let's just do some
first<00:03:14.900> turning<00:03:15.260> of<00:03:15.410> the<00:03:15.709> three<00:03:15.920> puzzles<00:03:16.250> I

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 
first turning of the three puzzles I

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:18.190 
first turning of the three puzzles I
forgot<00:03:16.700> to<00:03:16.820> mention<00:03:16.850> that<00:03:17.269> the<00:03:17.540> white<00:03:17.870> and<00:03:18.140> the

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 
forgot to mention that the white and the

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:19.900 
forgot to mention that the white and the
Fate<00:03:18.590> square<00:03:18.799> one<00:03:18.950> comes<00:03:19.160> with<00:03:19.280> a<00:03:19.310> pink<00:03:19.610> stand

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910 
Fate square one comes with a pink stand

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:22.780 
Fate square one comes with a pink stand
and<00:03:20.180> the<00:03:20.900> black<00:03:21.080> one<00:03:21.230> doesn't<00:03:21.680> so<00:03:22.430> let's<00:03:22.640> look

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:22.790 
and the black one doesn't so let's look

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:25.720 
and the black one doesn't so let's look
at<00:03:22.910> these<00:03:23.030> two<00:03:23.709> mf8<00:03:24.709> square<00:03:25.040> ones<00:03:25.250> first<00:03:25.549> I

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
at these two mf8 square ones first I

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:27.310 
at these two mf8 square ones first I
don't<00:03:25.910> know<00:03:26.209> if<00:03:26.450> it's<00:03:26.600> a<00:03:26.660> version<00:03:26.930> 10<00:03:27.080> version

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:27.320 
don't know if it's a version 10 version

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:29.860 
don't know if it's a version 10 version
2<00:03:27.560> although<00:03:27.830> I<00:03:27.980> can<00:03:28.250> check<00:03:28.459> and<00:03:28.519> I<00:03:28.760> will<00:03:28.970> but

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:29.870 
2 although I can check and I will but

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:32.289 
2 although I can check and I will but
let's<00:03:30.110> just<00:03:30.320> turn<00:03:30.530> this<00:03:30.680> first<00:03:30.980> and<00:03:31.310> it's

00:03:32.289 --> 00:03:32.299 
let's just turn this first and it's

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:36.910 
let's just turn this first and it's
absolutely<00:03:33.290> terrible<00:03:33.940> I<00:03:34.940> can<00:03:35.900> barely<00:03:36.470> move

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:36.920 
absolutely terrible I can barely move

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:41.170 
absolutely terrible I can barely move
this<00:03:38.260> yeah<00:03:39.260> that's<00:03:39.500> really<00:03:39.739> really<00:03:40.010> stiff<00:03:40.340> the

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:41.180 
this yeah that's really really stiff the

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:45.070 
this yeah that's really really stiff the
slices<00:03:42.130> actually<00:03:43.130> the<00:03:43.220> slice<00:03:43.459> is<00:03:43.610> okay<00:03:44.080> that's

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:45.080 
slices actually the slice is okay that's

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:47.650 
slices actually the slice is okay that's
not<00:03:45.230> too<00:03:45.290> bad<00:03:45.410> but<00:03:46.180> yeah<00:03:47.180> these<00:03:47.360> are<00:03:47.420> just

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:47.660 
not too bad but yeah these are just

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:49.630 
not too bad but yeah these are just
awful<00:03:48.049> let's<00:03:48.769> see<00:03:48.860> if<00:03:48.950> I<00:03:49.010> can<00:03:49.040> pop<00:03:49.280> the<00:03:49.400> piece

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:49.640 
awful let's see if I can pop the piece

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:54.280 
awful let's see if I can pop the piece
oh<00:03:51.700> yeah<00:03:52.700> this<00:03:52.850> is<00:03:52.910> the<00:03:53.090> fall<00:03:53.299> core<00:03:53.570> 1<00:03:53.780> so<00:03:54.019> this

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:54.290 
oh yeah this is the fall core 1 so this

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:56.170 
oh yeah this is the fall core 1 so this
is<00:03:54.500> apparently<00:03:55.250> the<00:03:55.430> bad<00:03:55.640> one<00:03:55.880> this<00:03:56.000> is<00:03:56.060> the

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:56.180 
is apparently the bad one this is the

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:59.110 
is apparently the bad one this is the
version<00:03:56.360> 2<00:03:56.750> so<00:03:57.709> that's<00:03:58.489> okay<00:03:58.760> i<00:03:58.790> probably

00:03:59.110 --> 00:03:59.120 
version 2 so that's okay i probably

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:02.229 
version 2 so that's okay i probably
won't<00:03:59.360> be<00:03:59.450> a<00:03:59.480> huge<00:03:59.870> square<00:04:00.290> one<00:04:00.470> solver<00:04:00.860> I<00:04:01.700> just

00:04:02.229 --> 00:04:02.239 
won't be a huge square one solver I just

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:04.390 
won't be a huge square one solver I just
wanted<00:04:02.570> to<00:04:02.720> at<00:04:03.410> least<00:04:03.530> learn<00:04:03.799> how<00:04:03.980> to<00:04:04.040> solve<00:04:04.280> it

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:04.400 
wanted to at least learn how to solve it

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.819 
wanted to at least learn how to solve it
and<00:04:04.549> be<00:04:04.820> able<00:04:04.880> to<00:04:05.000> compete<00:04:05.299> in<00:04:05.450> it<00:04:05.570> so<00:04:06.109> that's

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:06.829 
and be able to compete in it so that's

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:09.039 
and be able to compete in it so that's
totally<00:04:07.370> fine<00:04:07.549> here's<00:04:08.209> the<00:04:08.299> white<00:04:08.540> one<00:04:08.750> this

00:04:09.039 --> 00:04:09.049 
totally fine here's the white one this

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:09.970 
totally fine here's the white one this
seems<00:04:09.260> quite<00:04:09.739> a<00:04:09.769> bit

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:09.980 
seems quite a bit

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:13.740 
seems quite a bit
loser<00:04:10.280> the<00:04:11.030> slice<00:04:11.390> is<00:04:11.690> a<00:04:12.170> lot<00:04:12.500> faster<00:04:12.739> and

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:13.750 
loser the slice is a lot faster and

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:17.289 
loser the slice is a lot faster and
these<00:04:14.750> can<00:04:15.530> actually<00:04:15.890> turn<00:04:16.130> so<00:04:16.579> right<00:04:17.090> now<00:04:17.120> the

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:17.299 
these can actually turn so right now the

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:19.210 
these can actually turn so right now the
white<00:04:17.540> one<00:04:17.690> is<00:04:17.780> a<00:04:17.810> lot<00:04:17.930> better<00:04:18.109> of<00:04:18.590> course<00:04:19.040> with

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:19.220 
white one is a lot better of course with

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:23.080 
white one is a lot better of course with
lube<00:04:19.519> it's<00:04:19.940> hard<00:04:20.870> to<00:04:21.019> say<00:04:21.580> this<00:04:22.580> is<00:04:22.729> also<00:04:22.880> just

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.090 
lube it's hard to say this is also just

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:31.090 
lube it's hard to say this is also just
so<00:04:23.270> much<00:04:23.389> looser<00:04:27.880> yeah<00:04:29.320> it's<00:04:30.320> going<00:04:30.530> to<00:04:30.620> take<00:04:31.070> a

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:31.100 
so much looser yeah it's going to take a

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:33.120 
so much looser yeah it's going to take a
lot<00:04:31.250> of<00:04:31.310> getting<00:04:31.520> used<00:04:31.610> to<00:04:31.850> to<00:04:32.690> actually

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:33.130 
lot of getting used to to actually

excited I have a pretty good idea of how

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:40.719 
excited I have a pretty good idea of how
to<00:04:37.910> solve<00:04:38.180> one<00:04:38.410> but<00:04:39.410> right<00:04:39.979> now<00:04:40.040> still<00:04:40.610> don't

00:04:40.719 --> 00:04:40.729 
to solve one but right now still don't

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:43.029 
to solve one but right now still don't
know<00:04:40.940> yeah<00:04:41.750> these<00:04:41.930> are<00:04:41.990> very<00:04:42.530> very<00:04:42.680> thin

00:04:43.029 --> 00:04:43.039 
know yeah these are very very thin

00:04:43.039 --> 00:04:45.219 
know yeah these are very very thin
stickers<00:04:43.490> you<00:04:43.669> can<00:04:43.789> see<00:04:43.970> that<00:04:44.000> the<00:04:44.900> one<00:04:45.050> on<00:04:45.139> the

00:04:45.219 --> 00:04:45.229 
stickers you can see that the one on the

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:47.529 
stickers you can see that the one on the
white<00:04:45.410> plastic<00:04:45.949> for<00:04:46.190> green<00:04:46.400> and<00:04:46.550> yellow<00:04:46.850> this

00:04:47.529 --> 00:04:47.539 
white plastic for green and yellow this

00:04:47.539 --> 00:04:49.480 
white plastic for green and yellow this
looks<00:04:47.810> a<00:04:47.900> lot<00:04:47.990> brighter<00:04:48.260> on<00:04:48.620> both<00:04:49.250> of<00:04:49.280> these

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:49.490 
looks a lot brighter on both of these

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:51.939 
looks a lot brighter on both of these
for<00:04:49.970> the<00:04:50.060> others<00:04:50.240> yeah<00:04:51.199> blue<00:04:51.500> looks<00:04:51.770> a<00:04:51.860> lot

00:04:51.939 --> 00:04:51.949 
for the others yeah blue looks a lot

00:04:51.949 --> 00:04:56.830 
for the others yeah blue looks a lot
brighter<00:04:52.160> as<00:04:52.370> well<00:04:54.910> red<00:04:55.910> doesn't<00:04:56.120> seem<00:04:56.539> to<00:04:56.720> be

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:56.840 
brighter as well red doesn't seem to be

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:01.060 
brighter as well red doesn't seem to be
too<00:04:56.870> different<00:04:57.229> and<00:04:59.410> obviously<00:05:00.410> white<00:05:00.770> isn't

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:01.070 
too different and obviously white isn't

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:02.830 
too different and obviously white isn't
too<00:05:01.370> different<00:05:01.550> either<00:05:01.820> but<00:05:02.210> some<00:05:02.720> of<00:05:02.780> these

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:02.840 
too different either but some of these

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:05.800 
too different either but some of these
colors<00:05:03.050> are<00:05:03.320> very<00:05:03.650> very<00:05:03.919> different<00:05:04.039> and<00:05:04.810> I

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:05.810 
colors are very very different and I

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:08.409 
colors are very very different and I
might<00:05:06.680> actually<00:05:06.860> be<00:05:07.070> using<00:05:07.430> a<00:05:07.490> white<00:05:07.639> one<00:05:07.789> kind

00:05:08.409 --> 00:05:08.419 
might actually be using a white one kind

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:10.750 
might actually be using a white one kind
of<00:05:08.479> like<00:05:08.630> this<00:05:08.780> butter<00:05:08.990> we'll<00:05:09.830> see<00:05:10.010> let's<00:05:10.610> move
