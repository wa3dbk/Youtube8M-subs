00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:28.179
 so serves month for a presentation of the 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:28.679
 chassis of my friend averell so team 

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:31.330
 rockstar 

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:32.970
 so here we have the most fearful example of a 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:35.200
 yoko ono that can be tampered with 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:38.680
 to the point of being able to put more 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:42.320
 so we will find internship internship 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:46.370
 of internship iiia yoko words with 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:48.140
 stage iiia so type it is before we go 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:52.550
 see also rear triangle team suzuki 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:54.559
 so of course it's s-21 on it slows down 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:57.440
 also from the front we will have a small 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:01:00.470
 iv ball name not found detour vertex 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.239
 with came out last year at 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:03.860
 Japan 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:05.660
 all we can put two 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:08.630
 overdoses on so direction on 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:11.570
 slides especially also a small hold 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:13.750
 of vac ua dressings that was 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:15.710
 made for the occasion 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.060
 because my friend he wanted absolutely 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.820
 have this hold 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:21.369
 he was crazy when he saw so that's it 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:24.410
 get on it and that's good 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:27.110
 the same for the shock absorbers so crowd 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:29.840
 overdose conversion with black caps 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:32.750
 and the little aluminum 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.429
 of spring tension and even the 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:37.579
 cup from underneath and if we can see 

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:39.619
 also there are titanium accents for 

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:42.289
 have really better suspension 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:45.590
 possible so we will also find the 

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:47.869
 changing the tray to qu in shorts ipo 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:51.409
 transversal to have really 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:53.209
 weight on the back because this chassis 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:55.729
 has the particularity of having a lot of 

00:01:53.209 --> 00:01:59.119
 weights are in front and the rear drift 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:01.490
 many find a whole combo 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:04.670
 electronic without noah so brain 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:06.380
 Brushless Saônois the compet 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.989
 with also 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:11.680
 the small limited edition dimmer 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:14.450
 his name is going to see blue textile so 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.860
 150 copies in the world as we have 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:19.130
 at least already two in France for 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:22.459
 blind so here are small rockets 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:23.810
 kazama also with adjustable kpéhi and 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:25.670
 anchor points in all directions for 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.769
 really be on top of the setting as we 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.120
 wants to do it 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:31.220
 and then of course to small 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.160
 white platinum in white carbon and its 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:38.599
 throws of all beauty 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:41.200
