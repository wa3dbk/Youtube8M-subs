and<00:00:47.640> put<00:00:48.000> my<00:00:48.120> cursor<00:00:48.420> anywhere<00:00:48.870> in<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.140> sky

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
and put my cursor anywhere in the sky

with this blue hold down and drag to the

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.959 
with this blue hold down and drag to the
right<00:00:52.170> that<00:00:52.949> will<00:00:53.100> increase<00:00:53.520> the<00:00:53.820> saturation

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
right that will increase the saturation

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.630 
right that will increase the saturation
of<00:00:54.449> the<00:00:54.570> Blues<00:00:54.930> in<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.590> skies<00:00:55.890> we<00:00:56.250> can<00:00:56.399> see

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
of the Blues in the skies we can see

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.970 
of the Blues in the skies we can see
there<00:00:56.910> obviously<00:00:57.660> if<00:00:57.719> I<00:00:57.780> go<00:00:57.930> far<00:00:58.410> to<00:00:58.680> the<00:00:58.770> right

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
there obviously if I go far to the right

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.830 
there obviously if I go far to the right
or<00:00:59.039> increases<00:00:59.760> it<00:00:59.879> just<00:01:00.090> a<00:01:00.210> little<00:01:00.420> bit<00:01:00.629> too

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
or increases it just a little bit too

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.049 
or increases it just a little bit too
much<00:01:01.050> so<00:01:01.770> I'm<00:01:01.859> going<00:01:01.980> to<00:01:02.039> bring<00:01:02.250> it<00:01:02.399> down<00:01:02.730> to

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
much so I'm going to bring it down to

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.740 
much so I'm going to bring it down to
around<00:01:03.210> about<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:04.199> 65%<00:01:04.949> mark<00:01:05.670> and<00:01:06.030> we<00:01:06.299> can<00:01:06.450> see

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
around about the 65% mark and we can see

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:07.940 
around about the 65% mark and we can see
what<00:01:06.930> we're<00:01:07.049> doing<00:01:07.170> by<00:01:07.500> over<00:01:07.650> the<00:01:07.740> right<00:01:07.920> hand

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
what we're doing by over the right hand

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.240 
what we're doing by over the right hand
side<00:01:08.460> here<00:01:08.700> we<00:01:09.299> can<00:01:09.479> see<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:09.689> saturation

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:10.250 
side here we can see the saturation

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:12.679 
side here we can see the saturation
we're<00:01:11.250> going<00:01:11.490> left<00:01:11.790> we<00:01:12.000> can<00:01:12.150> see<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:12.420> sky<00:01:12.630> on

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
we're going left we can see the sky on

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.780 
we're going left we can see the sky on
the<00:01:12.720> Left<00:01:12.960> going<00:01:13.170> down<00:01:13.439> bring<00:01:14.189> it<00:01:14.310> up<00:01:14.430> we<00:01:14.640> can

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
the Left going down bring it up we can

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.070 
the Left going down bring it up we can
see<00:01:14.970> it's<00:01:15.119> increased<00:01:15.479> and<00:01:15.750> we're<00:01:15.840> gonna<00:01:15.930> go

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
see it's increased and we're gonna go

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.820 
see it's increased and we're gonna go
into<00:01:16.200> around<00:01:16.799> about<00:01:17.040> the<00:01:17.250> 65%<00:01:17.939> mark<00:01:18.540> whoops

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:18.830 
into around about the 65% mark whoops

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:24.859 
into around about the 65% mark whoops
sixty-five<00:01:19.830> something<00:01:20.729> like<00:01:22.280> that<00:01:23.280> okay<00:01:24.060> so

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
sixty-five something like that okay so

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.260 
sixty-five something like that okay so
now<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:25.619> sky<00:01:25.890> has<00:01:26.100> been<00:01:26.280> saturated<00:01:26.520> the<00:01:27.060> Blues

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
now the sky has been saturated the Blues

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.940 
now the sky has been saturated the Blues
are<00:01:27.420> lit<00:01:27.570> with<00:01:27.600> more<00:01:27.869> prominence<00:01:28.350> but<00:01:28.799> also

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
are lit with more prominence but also

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.770 
are lit with more prominence but also
the<00:01:29.250> genes<00:01:29.700> that<00:01:29.970> the<00:01:30.090> guys<00:01:30.240> are<00:01:30.420> wearing<00:01:30.509> has

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
the genes that the guys are wearing has

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.140 
the genes that the guys are wearing has
also<00:01:30.900> been<00:01:31.170> increased<00:01:31.500> so<00:01:32.310> whenever<00:01:32.610> we<00:01:32.850> add

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
also been increased so whenever we add

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.700 
also been increased so whenever we add
an<00:01:33.329> adjustment<00:01:33.450> layer<00:01:33.900> we<00:01:34.170> notice<00:01:34.530> that<00:01:34.650> we

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
an adjustment layer we notice that we

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.039 
an adjustment layer we notice that we
have<00:01:34.920> a<00:01:34.950> white<00:01:35.340> layer<00:01:35.670> mask<00:01:35.700> so<00:01:36.570> if<00:01:36.689> I<00:01:36.780> want<00:01:36.960> to

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
have a white layer mask so if I want to

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.499 
have a white layer mask so if I want to
reveal<00:01:37.409> the<00:01:37.650> Cullis<00:01:37.950> beneath<00:01:38.430> that<00:01:38.729> I<00:01:39.060> either

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
reveal the Cullis beneath that I either

pitcher<00:02:11.550> just<00:02:11.670> a<00:02:11.819> little<00:02:12.060> bit

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
pitcher just a little bit

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.670 
pitcher just a little bit
now<00:02:12.780> there<00:02:12.900> are<00:02:12.990> a<00:02:13.020> number<00:02:13.050> of<00:02:13.290> ways<00:02:13.380> we<00:02:13.410> could

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
now there are a number of ways we could

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.230 
now there are a number of ways we could
do<00:02:13.890> that<00:02:14.130> we<00:02:14.340> could<00:02:14.520> come<00:02:14.700> to<00:02:14.790> the<00:02:14.880> top<00:02:15.060> of<00:02:15.180> the

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
do that we could come to the top of the

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.990 
do that we could come to the top of the
screen<00:02:15.480> and<00:02:15.690> press<00:02:15.750> image<00:02:16.940> adjustments<00:02:17.940> and

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
screen and press image adjustments and

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.300 
screen and press image adjustments and
then<00:02:18.120> use<00:02:18.330> desaturate<00:02:19.230> but<00:02:19.740> what<00:02:19.860> I<00:02:19.890> like<00:02:20.130> to

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
then use desaturate but what I like to

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:21.800 
then use desaturate but what I like to
do<00:02:20.400> is<00:02:20.520> convert<00:02:20.940> the<00:02:21.090> image<00:02:21.270> to<00:02:21.390> black<00:02:21.540> and

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
do is convert the image to black and

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.440 
do is convert the image to black and
white<00:02:21.900> first<00:02:22.350> and<00:02:22.620> then<00:02:22.980> control<00:02:23.820> how<00:02:24.180> much<00:02:24.390> of

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
white first and then control how much of

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.900 
white first and then control how much of
that<00:02:24.720> black<00:02:24.960> and<00:02:24.990> white<00:02:25.200> shows<00:02:25.620> through<00:02:26.010> now

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
that black and white shows through now

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:28.430 
that black and white shows through now
again<00:02:27.330> we<00:02:27.450> could<00:02:27.600> use<00:02:27.810> black<00:02:28.140> and<00:02:28.380> white

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
again we could use black and white

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.590 
again we could use black and white
conversions<00:02:28.980> in<00:02:29.130> Photoshop<00:02:29.670> one<00:02:30.300> thing<00:02:30.450> I've

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
conversions in Photoshop one thing I've

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.570 
conversions in Photoshop one thing I've
done<00:02:30.900> a<00:02:31.140> lot<00:02:31.440> more<00:02:31.620> nowadays<00:02:32.070> is<00:02:32.250> using<00:02:32.520> a

we get a default black and white

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.950 
we get a default black and white
conversion<00:02:47.220> which<00:02:47.670> is<00:02:47.700> itself<00:02:48.210> is<00:02:48.360> quite<00:02:48.660> good

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:48.960 
conversion which is itself is quite good

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.660

I'm going to take this one down to
around<00:03:23.459> about<00:03:23.610> say<00:03:24.180> 30%<00:03:24.690> is<00:03:25.170> about<00:03:25.410> right<00:03:25.620> for

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:25.800 
around about say 30% is about right for

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.520 
around about say 30% is about right for
this<00:03:25.860> picture<00:03:26.209> and<00:03:27.209> I'll<00:03:27.300> zoom<00:03:27.330> out<00:03:27.750> and<00:03:28.230> by

00:04:43.349 --> 00:04:45.980 
down this bottom left-hand corner here
and<00:04:43.560> the<00:04:44.400> bottom<00:04:44.669> right-hand<00:04:45.060> corner<00:04:45.690> there

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:45.990 
and the bottom right-hand corner there

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:49.129 
and the bottom right-hand corner there
so<00:04:46.639> just<00:04:47.639> quickly<00:04:48.000> paint<00:04:48.419> over<00:04:48.720> there<00:04:48.870> just

00:04:49.129 --> 00:04:49.139 
so just quickly paint over there just

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:52.610 
so just quickly paint over there just
say<00:04:49.259> it<00:04:49.410> adds<00:04:49.590> a<00:04:49.830> little<00:04:49.979> bit<00:04:50.250> more<00:04:51.080> drama<00:04:52.080> draw

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:52.620 
say it adds a little bit more drama draw

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:54.409 
say it adds a little bit more drama draw
draws<00:04:52.979> the<00:04:53.160> eyes<00:04:53.280> more<00:04:53.759> into<00:04:54.000> where<00:04:54.150> the<00:04:54.240> guys

00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:54.419 
draws the eyes more into where the guys

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:55.939 
draws the eyes more into where the guys
are<00:04:54.449> sitting<00:04:54.780> we<00:04:55.020> can<00:04:55.169> turn<00:04:55.349> that<00:04:55.440> layer<00:04:55.680> on

00:04:55.939 --> 00:04:55.949 
are sitting we can turn that layer on

00:04:55.949 --> 00:04:58.610 
are sitting we can turn that layer on
and<00:04:56.130> off<00:04:56.190> like<00:04:56.819> so<00:04:57.270> now<00:04:57.840> if<00:04:57.930> that's<00:04:58.050> too<00:04:58.349> dark

00:04:58.610 --> 00:04:58.620 
and off like so now if that's too dark

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:00.290 
and off like so now if that's too dark
all<00:04:58.889> we<00:04:58.979> need<00:04:59.130> to<00:04:59.159> do<00:04:59.460> because<00:04:59.849> it's<00:05:00.030> on<00:05:00.150> its

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:00.300 
all we need to do because it's on its

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:02.659 
all we need to do because it's on its
own<00:05:00.449> layer<00:05:00.720> we<00:05:01.289> can<00:05:01.440> use<00:05:01.650> the<00:05:01.800> a<00:05:01.830> pasty<00:05:02.340> slider

00:05:02.659 --> 00:05:02.669 
own layer we can use the a pasty slider

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:04.999 
own layer we can use the a pasty slider
to<00:05:02.909> increase<00:05:03.300> or<00:05:03.569> decrease<00:05:03.599> it<00:05:04.319> to<00:05:04.349> however<00:05:04.830> we

00:05:04.999 --> 00:05:05.009 
to increase or decrease it to however we

00:05:05.009 --> 00:05:05.689 
to increase or decrease it to however we
feel<00:05:05.220> it

00:05:05.689 --> 00:05:05.699 
feel it

00:05:05.699 --> 00:05:07.640 
feel it
it's<00:05:06.090> suited<00:05:06.539> and<00:05:06.930> I'll<00:05:07.050> probably<00:05:07.229> just<00:05:07.500> keep

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:07.650 
it's suited and I'll probably just keep

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:09.409 
it's suited and I'll probably just keep
it<00:05:07.860> nice<00:05:08.039> and<00:05:08.099> simple<00:05:08.400> around<00:05:08.729> about<00:05:08.880> the<00:05:08.970> 85

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:09.419 
it nice and simple around about the 85

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:11.570 
it nice and simple around about the 85
percent<00:05:09.449> mark<00:05:10.080> so<00:05:10.860> there<00:05:10.979> we<00:05:11.069> go<00:05:11.099> that's<00:05:11.460> the

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:11.580 
percent mark so there we go that's the

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:14.240 
percent mark so there we go that's the
vignette<00:05:12.090> on<00:05:12.270> and<00:05:12.659> the<00:05:12.750> vignette<00:05:13.169> off<00:05:13.259> okay

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:14.250 
vignette on and the vignette off okay

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:16.129 
vignette on and the vignette off okay
the<00:05:14.639> final<00:05:14.940> stage<00:05:15.330> just<00:05:15.630> a<00:05:15.750> little<00:05:15.960> bit<00:05:16.050> of

00:05:16.129 --> 00:05:16.139 
the final stage just a little bit of

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:18.409 
the final stage just a little bit of
sharpening<00:05:16.759> so<00:05:17.759> we'll<00:05:17.909> flatten<00:05:18.210> the<00:05:18.270> image

00:05:18.409 --> 00:05:18.419 
sharpening so we'll flatten the image

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:20.600 
sharpening so we'll flatten the image
again<00:05:18.539> and<00:05:18.990> we'll<00:05:19.740> drag<00:05:20.009> that<00:05:20.220> background

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:20.610 
again and we'll drag that background

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:22.339 
again and we'll drag that background
layer<00:05:20.789> to<00:05:20.849> the<00:05:21.030> new<00:05:21.150> layer<00:05:21.360> icon<00:05:21.539> so<00:05:22.080> we<00:05:22.199> get

00:05:22.339 --> 00:05:22.349 
layer to the new layer icon so we get

00:05:22.349 --> 00:05:24.890 
layer to the new layer icon so we get
the<00:05:22.470> background<00:05:22.949> copy<00:05:23.190> and<00:05:23.550> to<00:05:24.270> sharpen<00:05:24.810> it

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:24.900 
the background copy and to sharpen it

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:25.999 
the background copy and to sharpen it
what<00:05:25.080> I<00:05:25.110> want<00:05:25.259> to<00:05:25.349> do<00:05:25.470> to<00:05:25.620> add<00:05:25.680> a<00:05:25.710> little<00:05:25.860> bit

00:05:25.999 --> 00:05:26.009 
what I want to do to add a little bit

00:05:26.009 --> 00:05:27.890 
what I want to do to add a little bit
more<00:05:26.159> punch<00:05:26.460> to<00:05:26.610> it<00:05:26.789> is<00:05:27.030> use<00:05:27.240> the<00:05:27.389> high-pass

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:27.900 
more punch to it is use the high-pass

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:30.020 
more punch to it is use the high-pass
filter<00:05:28.349> so<00:05:29.099> we're<00:05:29.280> going<00:05:29.400> to<00:05:29.490> go<00:05:29.639> to<00:05:29.699> the<00:05:29.849> top

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:30.030 
filter so we're going to go to the top

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:32.330 
filter so we're going to go to the top
of<00:05:30.060> the<00:05:30.180> screen<00:05:30.449> choose<00:05:30.509> filter<00:05:31.320> over<00:05:32.159> and

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:32.340 
of the screen choose filter over and

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:35.689 
of the screen choose filter over and
high-pass<00:05:33.120> and<00:05:33.680> we're<00:05:34.680> gonna<00:05:34.770> use<00:05:35.070> a<00:05:35.099> radius

00:05:35.689 --> 00:05:35.699 
high-pass and we're gonna use a radius

00:05:35.699 --> 00:05:38.240 
high-pass and we're gonna use a radius
of<00:05:35.849> around<00:05:35.969> about<00:05:36.599> two<00:05:37.080> pixels<00:05:37.650> just<00:05:37.919> so<00:05:38.130> we

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:38.250 
of around about two pixels just so we

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:40.310 
of around about two pixels just so we
can<00:05:38.400> see<00:05:38.729> the<00:05:39.030> image<00:05:39.300> coming<00:05:39.630> through<00:05:40.050> the

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:40.320 
can see the image coming through the

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:42.830 
can see the image coming through the
gray<00:05:40.650> here<00:05:41.009> that's<00:05:41.849> about<00:05:42.090> that's<00:05:42.360> about<00:05:42.630> raw

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:42.840 
gray here that's about that's about raw

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:44.029 
gray here that's about that's about raw
actually<00:05:43.199> yeah<00:05:43.259> we'll<00:05:43.409> keep<00:05:43.500> it<00:05:43.680> it<00:05:43.770> to

00:05:44.029 --> 00:05:44.039 
actually yeah we'll keep it it to

00:05:44.039 --> 00:05:46.580 
actually yeah we'll keep it it to
something<00:05:44.280> like<00:05:44.430> so<00:05:44.820> 2.1<00:05:45.449> yeah<00:05:45.780> these<00:05:46.320> blues

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:46.590

that will come up the layers panel to

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.029 
that will come up the layers panel to
change<00:05:51.479> the<00:05:51.630> blend<00:05:51.990> mode<00:05:52.110> of<00:05:52.259> that<00:05:52.500> to<00:05:52.710> soft

it<00:05:59.490> just<00:05:59.669> adds<00:05:59.849> a<00:05:59.969> nice<00:06:00.090> bit<00:06:00.300> of<00:06:00.330> sharland<00:06:00.900> a

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:01.020 
it just adds a nice bit of sharland a

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:03.709 
it just adds a nice bit of sharland a
bit<00:06:01.169> more<00:06:01.380> of<00:06:01.440> a<00:06:01.530> kick<00:06:01.979> to<00:06:02.039> the<00:06:02.219> picture<00:06:02.719> so

00:06:03.709 --> 00:06:03.719 
bit more of a kick to the picture so

00:06:03.719 --> 00:06:05.779 
bit more of a kick to the picture so
there<00:06:03.870> we<00:06:03.930> go<00:06:03.960> that's<00:06:04.319> the<00:06:04.530> final<00:06:05.099> image<00:06:05.460> so

00:06:05.779 --> 00:06:05.789 
there we go that's the final image so

00:06:05.789 --> 00:06:08.749 
there we go that's the final image so
three<00:06:06.770> editing<00:06:07.770> sessions<00:06:08.159> we've<00:06:08.310> gone<00:06:08.490> from

00:06:08.749 --> 00:06:08.759 
three editing sessions we've gone from

00:06:08.759 --> 00:06:11.420 
three editing sessions we've gone from
literally<00:06:09.389> a<00:06:09.569> picture<00:06:10.380> we've<00:06:10.860> ended<00:06:11.159> up<00:06:11.250> like

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:11.430 
literally a picture we've ended up like

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:12.020 
literally a picture we've ended up like
this

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:12.030 
this

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:14.360 
this
and<00:06:12.120> we<00:06:12.330> started<00:06:12.750> off<00:06:12.900> like<00:06:13.139> that<00:06:13.560> so<00:06:13.889> in<00:06:14.069> three

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:14.370 
and we started off like that so in three

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:15.649 
and we started off like that so in three
episodes<00:06:14.520> we've<00:06:15.030> managed<00:06:15.210> to<00:06:15.270> get<00:06:15.360> rid<00:06:15.509> of<00:06:15.539> all

00:06:15.649 --> 00:06:15.659 
episodes we've managed to get rid of all

00:06:15.659 --> 00:06:18.709 
episodes we've managed to get rid of all
this<00:06:15.719> junk<00:06:15.800> we've<00:06:16.800> increased<00:06:17.310> the<00:06:18.180> D<00:06:18.360> turn<00:06:18.569> the

00:06:18.709 --> 00:06:18.719 
this junk we've increased the D turn the
