 we download in my team case 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:42.670
 documents the canon 74 we will do the 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:45.250
 folder that is and will leave us an iso 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:48.100
 I recommend using to be able to mount the 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:50.470
 picture was needed we tried call 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:53.560

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:56.500
 I will leave ultraism in the 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:59.940
 good description once downloaded I 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:02.920
 I have having the isola wet right 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:05.860
 extracted and assembled in unit 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:08.140
 and another behind that you can be 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:10.750
 now and once this is done we are going to 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:13.990
 my team good a very important thing 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:15.730
 before starting the installation but 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:17.530
 have to see if they meet the 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:20.200
 requirements for that we're going to 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:22.040
 Start of interest in the team and 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.680
 properties 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:27.560
 and who will be in my case my 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:30.230
 computer is very good 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:33.319
 and to be able to know the memory of their 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.940
 graphics for processing in the massacre 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:37.550
 It is made on the desk of 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:39.349
 screen resolution and configuration 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:43.740
 advanced memory may be 

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:47.970
 graphics and in mine is very good 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:50.590
 but once mounted images 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:53.170
 the leagues 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:56.379
 Once it has already bid, it mounts the image 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:59.080
 has marked him right and in opening here 

00:02:56.379 --> 00:03:02.170
 brings the crack in extras will leave 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:05.050
 adobe reader not feeling well and the 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:09.130
 direct x good we make a situation 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:13.200
 let's open the file is tube 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:13.200
 he 's going to kill him only as administrator 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:18.920
 ok lower the volume in case it sounds a lot 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:25.140
 although you should get this out by getting ready 

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:28.010
 for the installation 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:28.010
 what do we expect 

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:34.870
 We hope this installation should take 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:38.120
 much 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:41.480
 since the mature file 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:43.920
 like two days since my intern 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:47.370
 it's still slow 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:49.050
 I'm not sure about that lens 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:52.830
 the installation because I'm recording with 

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:57.170
 sing with you since I put the video 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:57.170
 so it makes me so long 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:04.170
 good friends once opened this as 

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:06.810
 sure since leaving this welcome 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:10.080
 extraction program when you 49 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:11.720
 please we leave now next in 

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:14.430
 our part will tell you that 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:17.430
 they need a key to a loved product 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:20.580
 first the start button is the side of 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:24.300
 control a corner in the corner of 

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:26.340
 keyboard and we will follow where 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:29.040
 I was in a team and the units 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:33.560
 and we will not go to crack as we attract or 

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:36.540
 read me of this is to bring well one is the 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:39.480
 the institutions install a new 

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:42.300
 case a woman this serial or so that 

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:45.630
 it becomes so difficult for us to close this and 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:48.630
 we are going here not to generate 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:49.770
 serial of everything in cereals good 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:51.600
 I can do the plan I can not 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:53.350
 place the serial in the weekly the 

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:56.140
 video 

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:58.630
 good friends a beautiful cup of cereal what 

00:04:56.140 --> 00:05:00.580
 competed that is what fashion denotes 

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:02.860
 following 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:06.430
 everything with him if he comes out this we ignore 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:10.840
 to upset as we are the terms of the 

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:12.600
 license agreement and here they read this what 

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:15.450
 I will moor next 

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:18.120
 to approach it I do not think the salt and 

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:20.889
 here will come the triquis landmarks of 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:22.719
 software if they want to know 

00:05:20.889 --> 00:05:24.910
 in my case I fulfill the same 

00:05:22.719 --> 00:05:26.680
 Requirements 

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:30.940
 as you can see 

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:33.220
 in your memory everything is a state of your own 

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:35.949
 let's go to the next one we talk about 

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:38.980
 it the most recommended you should do the 

00:05:35.949 --> 00:05:41.530
 typical installation of what is typical 

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:43.870
 next and if not start installing 

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:46.950
 pause the video but do not be wrong 

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:46.950
 lengthen so much 

00:05:47.969 --> 00:05:53.699
 and good friends here is supposed to 

00:05:50.999 --> 00:05:56.039
 will say this completes the installation and that 

00:05:53.699 --> 00:05:57.689
 and you get to ask what you want 

00:05:56.039 --> 00:06:01.030
 create a desktop shortcut 

00:05:57.689 --> 00:06:03.640
 of windows join yes 

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:05.620
 and will push to finalize star that is 

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:09.980
 the establishment of the dt here if not the 

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:12.760
 they have they are not really not 

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:16.380
 but say no 

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:20.420
 forgiveness or yes 

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:20.420
 and from the terminal will be with yours 

00:06:21.139 --> 00:06:27.350
 from that portfolio carlos de amigos now 

00:06:24.259 --> 00:06:30.620
 well the next step that would be create it 

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:32.830
 as they see it is there are two ways 

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:32.830
 multiplayer 

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:42.090
 then the individual player and motive 

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:45.270
 for a multiplayer room you should 

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:48.450
 have an original key since nothing 

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:51.720
 can with shoulder to market right to 

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:56.340
 individual player and open location 

00:06:51.720 --> 00:07:00.390
 graciÃ³ celebrates direct and we are not going to 

00:06:56.340 --> 00:07:01.350
 the cd unit and a la carte to new 

00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:04.740
 team 

00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:09.000
 units and the reader made open to 

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:11.810
 crack and they will have that crazy file what 

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.810
 we occupy 

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:18.530
 copy and that nothing location the fashion to 

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:21.310
 paste we go to the cope to replace 

00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:22.740
 continue 

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:24.930
 t 

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:27.720
 once this will have a game 

00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:30.990
 cracker ready to play as you see 

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:32.789
 here the instructions says that for 

00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:35.789
 play online you need though 

00:07:32.789 --> 00:07:38.580
 original so it does not taste well 

00:07:35.789 --> 00:07:41.130
 because the first is that you installed a 

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:44.759
 but then this friends up another video 

00:07:41.130 --> 00:07:48.470
 first tutorial all your luck like 

00:07:44.759 --> 00:07:48.470
 for more video programs
