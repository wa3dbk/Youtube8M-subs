00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:11.180 
learned about foundation into action
step<00:00:09.389> one<00:00:09.599> is<00:00:09.840> to<00:00:10.019> cleanse<00:00:10.290> the<00:00:10.590> skin<00:00:10.860> so<00:00:11.099> I'm

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
step one is to cleanse the skin so I'm

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.190 
step one is to cleanse the skin so I'm
using<00:00:11.429> my<00:00:11.670> cleanser<00:00:12.150> here<00:00:12.540> and<00:00:12.719> this<00:00:13.080> will

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
using my cleanser here and this will

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.720 
using my cleanser here and this will
make<00:00:13.380> sure<00:00:13.410> that<00:00:13.679> our<00:00:13.799> foundation<00:00:14.099> goes<00:00:14.519> on

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
make sure that our foundation goes on

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.910 
make sure that our foundation goes on
better<00:00:14.969> last<00:00:15.599> longer<00:00:16.020> because<00:00:16.379> the<00:00:16.650> skin<00:00:16.890> is

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
better last longer because the skin is

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.620 
better last longer because the skin is
smooth<00:00:17.430> and<00:00:17.699> fresh<00:00:19.250> step<00:00:20.250> two<00:00:20.520> is<00:00:20.760> to<00:00:20.820> tone<00:00:21.330> so

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
smooth and fresh step two is to tone so

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.750 
smooth and fresh step two is to tone so
I'm<00:00:21.689> taking<00:00:21.869> my<00:00:22.170> cotton<00:00:22.500> pads<00:00:22.740> on<00:00:23.160> a<00:00:23.220> soaking

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
I'm taking my cotton pads on a soaking

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.400 
I'm taking my cotton pads on a soaking
and<00:00:23.910> some<00:00:24.060> of<00:00:24.150> my<00:00:24.269> toner<00:00:24.539> and<00:00:24.779> wipe<00:00:25.109> it<00:00:25.320> over

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
and some of my toner and wipe it over

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.700 
and some of my toner and wipe it over
the<00:00:25.650> skin<00:00:25.920> a<00:00:26.779> toner<00:00:27.779> is<00:00:27.990> basically<00:00:28.320> just<00:00:28.439> a

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
the skin a toner is basically just a

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.410 
the skin a toner is basically just a
liquid<00:00:29.130> that<00:00:29.160> you<00:00:29.279> don't<00:00:29.580> have<00:00:29.820> to<00:00:30.000> rinse<00:00:30.179> off

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
liquid that you don't have to rinse off

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.089 
liquid that you don't have to rinse off
that's<00:00:30.869> like<00:00:31.050> a<00:00:31.080> secondary<00:00:31.619> step<00:00:31.890> to

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
that's like a secondary step to

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:40.700 
that's like a secondary step to
cleansing<00:00:38.300> step<00:00:39.300> three<00:00:39.600> is<00:00:39.750> so<00:00:40.020> important<00:00:40.590> and

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
cleansing step three is so important and

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.310 
cleansing step three is so important and
it's<00:00:41.010> to<00:00:41.250> moisturize<00:00:41.910> this<00:00:42.629> is<00:00:42.840> actually

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
it's to moisturize this is actually

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.600 
it's to moisturize this is actually
going<00:00:43.469> to<00:00:43.559> give<00:00:43.680> our<00:00:43.800> foundation<00:00:44.280> something

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
going to give our foundation something

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.970 
going to give our foundation something
to<00:00:44.700> hold<00:00:44.940> on<00:00:45.180> to<00:00:45.420> so<00:00:45.840> it<00:00:45.960> will<00:00:46.140> last<00:00:46.379> longer<00:00:46.739> on

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
to hold on to so it will last longer on

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.369 
to hold on to so it will last longer on
the<00:00:47.070> skin<00:00:48.079> and<00:00:50.360> the<00:00:51.360> biggest<00:00:51.750> step<00:00:51.960> is<00:00:52.140> to

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
the skin and the biggest step is to

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.290 
the skin and the biggest step is to
leave<00:00:52.620> it<00:00:52.770> for<00:00:52.800> at<00:00:53.160> least<00:00:53.190> five<00:00:53.760> minutes

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
leave it for at least five minutes

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.450 
leave it for at least five minutes
so<00:00:54.629> once<00:00:54.899> you've<00:00:55.050> moisturize<00:00:55.530> give<00:00:56.100> yourself

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
so once you've moisturize give yourself

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.819 
so once you've moisturize give yourself
a<00:00:56.520> little<00:00:56.640> bit<00:00:56.850> of<00:00:56.940> time<00:00:57.469> this<00:00:58.469> will<00:00:58.620> make<00:00:58.800> sure

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
a little bit of time this will make sure

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.470 
a little bit of time this will make sure
that<00:00:59.039> the<00:00:59.250> skin<00:00:59.489> is<00:00:59.609> settled<00:01:00.030> and<00:01:00.210> the

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
that the skin is settled and the

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.359 
that the skin is settled and the
moisturizer<00:01:00.989> has<00:01:01.260> sunk<00:01:01.559> in<00:01:04.040> next<00:01:05.040> step<00:01:05.189> is

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369
