00:05:34.379 --> 00:05:34.389 
was fair but actually it actually wasn't

00:05:34.389 --> 00:05:36.809 
was fair but actually it actually wasn't
because<00:05:34.839> yes<00:05:35.469> everyone<00:05:36.069> could<00:05:36.279> get<00:05:36.430> kills

00:05:36.809 --> 00:05:36.819 
because yes everyone could get kills

00:05:36.819 --> 00:05:39.480 
because yes everyone could get kills
with<00:05:37.060> the<00:05:37.150> noob<00:05:37.330> tubes<00:05:37.659> multi<00:05:38.229> kills<00:05:38.469> but<00:05:38.889> you

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:39.490 
with the noob tubes multi kills but you

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:41.189 
with the noob tubes multi kills but you
had<00:05:39.669> no<00:05:39.849> way<00:05:40.029> to<00:05:40.060> defend<00:05:40.210> yourself<00:05:40.629> so

00:05:41.189 --> 00:05:41.199 
had no way to defend yourself so

00:05:41.199 --> 00:05:43.649 
had no way to defend yourself so
everyone<00:05:41.740> also<00:05:41.919> had<00:05:42.190> a<00:05:42.370> shit<00:05:43.000> ton<00:05:43.180> of<00:05:43.240> deaths

00:05:43.649 --> 00:05:43.659 
everyone also had a shit ton of deaths

00:05:43.659 --> 00:05:46.079 
everyone also had a shit ton of deaths
and<00:05:43.930> it<00:05:44.379> was<00:05:44.560> kind<00:05:44.800> of<00:05:44.889> hard<00:05:45.159> to<00:05:45.310> go<00:05:45.610> on<00:05:45.639> a<00:05:45.729> kill

00:05:46.079 --> 00:05:46.089 
and it was kind of hard to go on a kill

00:05:46.089 --> 00:05:47.490 
and it was kind of hard to go on a kill
streak<00:05:46.240> because<00:05:46.659> I<00:05:46.810> mean<00:05:47.110> you<00:05:47.229> would<00:05:47.349> get<00:05:47.469> a

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:47.500 
streak because I mean you would get a

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:49.379 
streak because I mean you would get a
kill<00:05:47.830> and<00:05:47.979> then<00:05:48.310> you<00:05:48.430> would<00:05:48.580> die<00:05:48.819> because<00:05:49.060> of<00:05:49.210> a

00:05:49.379 --> 00:05:49.389 
kill and then you would die because of a

00:05:49.389 --> 00:05:51.149 
kill and then you would die because of a
random<00:05:49.569> noob<00:05:49.930> tube<00:05:50.229> because<00:05:50.740> someone<00:05:51.009> was

00:05:51.149 --> 00:05:51.159 
random noob tube because someone was

00:05:51.159 --> 00:05:53.579 
random noob tube because someone was
using<00:05:51.310> danger-close<00:05:51.819> because<00:05:52.690> someone<00:05:53.020> fired

00:05:53.579 --> 00:05:53.589 
using danger-close because someone fired

00:05:53.589 --> 00:05:55.350 
using danger-close because someone fired
its<00:05:53.830> noob<00:05:54.069> tube<00:05:54.279> and<00:05:54.460> it<00:05:54.520> landed<00:05:54.849> a<00:05:55.000> mile<00:05:55.180> away

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:55.360 
its noob tube and it landed a mile away

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:56.670 
its noob tube and it landed a mile away
from<00:05:55.479> you<00:05:55.810> but<00:05:56.020> because<00:05:56.139> they<00:05:56.409> were<00:05:56.500> using

00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:56.680 
from you but because they were using

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:59.550 
from you but because they were using
danger-close<00:05:57.189> you<00:05:57.849> died<00:05:58.180> so<00:05:58.509> it<00:05:58.839> was<00:05:58.990> actually

00:05:59.550 --> 00:05:59.560 
danger-close you died so it was actually

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:01.589 
danger-close you died so it was actually
hard<00:05:59.770> to<00:05:59.830> go<00:06:00.039> on<00:06:00.159> a<00:06:00.189> kill<00:06:00.550> streak<00:06:00.669> unless<00:06:01.060> you

00:06:01.589 --> 00:06:01.599 
hard to go on a kill streak unless you

00:06:01.599 --> 00:06:05.100 
hard to go on a kill streak unless you
could<00:06:01.810> get<00:06:01.960> like<00:06:02.139> two<00:06:02.710> multi<00:06:03.550> kills<00:06:03.819> so<00:06:04.449> I<00:06:04.479> mean
