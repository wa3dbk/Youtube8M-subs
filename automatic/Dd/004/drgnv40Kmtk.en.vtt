the James Hunt storyline and Bruhl was a
stronger<00:02:39.310> actor<00:02:39.670> or<00:02:39.910> because<00:02:40.480> I<00:02:40.510> just<00:02:40.900> related

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260

incredibly different but either way

though<00:02:58.540> I<00:02:58.570> think<00:02:58.720> this<00:02:58.930> is<00:02:59.080> a<00:02:59.110> little<00:02:59.350> bit<00:02:59.470> of<00:02:59.560> a

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 
though I think this is a little bit of a

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.620 
though I think this is a little bit of a
concern<00:02:59.950> for<00:03:00.220> Chris<00:03:00.460> Hemsworth<00:03:00.880> because<00:03:01.510> this

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:01.630 
concern for Chris Hemsworth because this

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:03.030 
concern for Chris Hemsworth because this
is<00:03:01.780> the<00:03:01.870> second<00:03:02.320> time<00:03:02.530> he's<00:03:02.800> being

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
is the second time he's being

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:04.830 
is the second time he's being
overshadowed<00:03:03.430> in<00:03:03.940> a<00:03:04.000> film<00:03:04.270> where<00:03:04.660> he's

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
overshadowed in a film where he's

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.090 
overshadowed in a film where he's
supposed<00:03:04.960> to<00:03:05.230> be<00:03:05.380> the<00:03:05.470> star<00:03:05.710> the<00:03:05.860> first

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:40.870 
actually became a little bit concerned I

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:43.110 
actually became a little bit concerned I
was<00:03:40.990> like<00:03:41.170> another<00:03:41.500> biography<00:03:42.340> where<00:03:42.850> they

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
was like another biography where they

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:44.730 
was like another biography where they
stretched<00:03:43.450> themselves<00:03:43.930> too<00:03:44.110> thin<00:03:44.140> with<00:03:44.530> too

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:44.740 
stretched themselves too thin with too

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:46.020 
stretched themselves too thin with too
much<00:03:44.860> to<00:03:45.040> cover<00:03:45.220> I<00:03:45.490> was<00:03:45.640> thinking<00:03:45.910> they<00:03:46.000> should

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 
much to cover I was thinking they should

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:47.760 
much to cover I was thinking they should
have<00:03:46.270> focused<00:03:46.420> on<00:03:46.780> either<00:03:46.900> hunt<00:03:47.230> or<00:03:47.440> Lauda

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:47.770 
have focused on either hunt or Lauda

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:49.380 
have focused on either hunt or Lauda
because<00:03:48.490> they<00:03:48.640> just<00:03:48.790> weren't<00:03:48.940> going<00:03:49.210> into

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:49.390 
because they just weren't going into

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:51.660 
because they just weren't going into
enough<00:03:49.630> enough<00:03:50.110> depth<00:03:50.380> with<00:03:50.530> any<00:03:50.740> of<00:03:50.890> them<00:03:51.040> but

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:51.670 
enough enough depth with any of them but

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:53.130 
enough enough depth with any of them but
then<00:03:51.850> as<00:03:51.970> the<00:03:52.090> movie<00:03:52.330> came<00:03:52.510> along<00:03:52.810> and<00:03:52.990> it

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:53.140 
then as the movie came along and it

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:54.510 
then as the movie came along and it
found<00:03:53.320> its<00:03:53.530> groove<00:03:53.590> which<00:03:54.040> is<00:03:54.190> really<00:03:54.400> to

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:54.520 
found its groove which is really to

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:56.130 
found its groove which is really to
depict<00:03:54.820> this<00:03:54.970> rivalry<00:03:55.240> between<00:03:55.720> the<00:03:55.990> two

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:56.140 
depict this rivalry between the two

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:58.400 
depict this rivalry between the two
drivers<00:03:56.410> which<00:03:56.740> was<00:03:56.920> pretty<00:03:57.400> phenomenal<00:03:57.580> uh

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:58.410 
drivers which was pretty phenomenal uh

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:00.510 
drivers which was pretty phenomenal uh
then<00:03:59.410> it<00:03:59.590> really<00:03:59.800> started<00:04:00.070> to<00:04:00.160> pick<00:04:00.370> up<00:04:00.460> speed

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:00.520 
then it really started to pick up speed

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:03.030 
then it really started to pick up speed
and<00:04:01.000> to<00:04:01.210> just<00:04:01.510> do<00:04:01.690> a<00:04:01.720> wonderful<00:04:02.050> job<00:04:02.350> and<00:04:02.830> I

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:03.040 
and to just do a wonderful job and I

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:04.950 
and to just do a wonderful job and I
would<00:04:03.190> say<00:04:03.310> the<00:04:03.430> last<00:04:03.550> two<00:04:03.940> thirds<00:04:04.330> to<00:04:04.600> half<00:04:04.780> of

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:04.960 
would say the last two thirds to half of

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:07.260 
would say the last two thirds to half of
the<00:04:05.110> film<00:04:05.290> are<00:04:05.530> really<00:04:06.340> incredible<00:04:06.850> and<00:04:07.060> it<00:04:07.150> by

was a newcomer behind the camera with

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:26.100 
was a newcomer behind the camera with
something<00:04:24.310> to<00:04:24.430> prove<00:04:24.670> he<00:04:25.240> makes<00:04:25.450> really<00:04:25.720> bold

creative<00:04:26.500> choices<00:04:27.000> and<00:04:28.000> in<00:04:28.120> indie<00:04:28.480> film

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:28.870 
creative choices and in indie film

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:30.900 
creative choices and in indie film
stylings<00:04:29.530> which<00:04:30.010> were<00:04:30.130> really<00:04:30.310> refreshing<00:04:30.880> to

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:30.910 
stylings which were really refreshing to

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:32.820 
stylings which were really refreshing to
see<00:04:31.030> with<00:04:31.300> a<00:04:31.330> race<00:04:31.540> car<00:04:31.840> film<00:04:32.080> because<00:04:32.380> I<00:04:32.590> think

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:32.830 
see with a race car film because I think

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:34.230 
see with a race car film because I think
at<00:04:33.130> this<00:04:33.220> point<00:04:33.430> it's<00:04:33.640> interesting<00:04:33.880> I<00:04:34.120> was

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:34.240 
at this point it's interesting I was

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:35.310 
at this point it's interesting I was
thinking<00:04:34.540> that<00:04:34.570> also<00:04:34.780> during<00:04:35.110> the<00:04:35.200> beginning

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:35.320 
thinking that also during the beginning

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:36.810 
thinking that also during the beginning
of<00:04:35.590> the<00:04:35.650> film<00:04:35.890> when<00:04:36.070> it<00:04:36.130> was<00:04:36.250> a<00:04:36.310> little<00:04:36.430> slow

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:36.820 
of the film when it was a little slow

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:39.000 
of the film when it was a little slow
that<00:04:37.420> I<00:04:37.720> was<00:04:38.080> like<00:04:38.230> I'm<00:04:38.380> pretty<00:04:38.560> familiar<00:04:38.740> with

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:39.010 
that I was like I'm pretty familiar with

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:40.800 
that I was like I'm pretty familiar with
the<00:04:39.160> world<00:04:39.340> of<00:04:39.430> racing<00:04:39.610> thanks<00:04:40.120> to<00:04:40.240> animation

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:40.810 
the world of racing thanks to animation

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:43.380 
the world of racing thanks to animation
with<00:04:40.990> the<00:04:41.110> world<00:04:41.260> of<00:04:41.410> cars<00:04:41.680> and<00:04:42.070> turbo<00:04:42.490> then<00:04:43.330> I

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:43.390 
with the world of cars and turbo then I

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:44.970 
with the world of cars and turbo then I
and<00:04:43.570> I<00:04:43.690> know<00:04:43.750> I<00:04:44.140> know<00:04:44.260> a<00:04:44.380> lot<00:04:44.590> about<00:04:44.800> how<00:04:44.950> it

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:44.980 
and I know I know a lot about how it

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:47.580 
and I know I know a lot about how it
works<00:04:45.310> and<00:04:45.610> you<00:04:45.670> know<00:04:45.730> kind<00:04:46.300> of<00:04:46.390> the<00:04:46.590> different

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:47.590 
works and you know kind of the different

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:50.310 
works and you know kind of the different
dynamics<00:04:48.100> off<00:04:48.280> off<00:04:48.730> on<00:04:49.060> and<00:04:49.240> off<00:04:49.270> the<00:04:49.510> track<00:04:49.720> so

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:50.320 
dynamics off off on and off the track so

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:53.340 
dynamics off off on and off the track so
this<00:04:50.500> film<00:04:50.770> really<00:04:51.280> needed<00:04:51.700> to<00:04:51.730> elevate<00:04:52.630> just

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:53.350 
this film really needed to elevate just

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:54.840 
this film really needed to elevate just
being<00:04:53.620> above<00:04:53.890> that<00:04:54.070> kind<00:04:54.280> of<00:04:54.370> procedural

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:54.850 
being above that kind of procedural

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:57.090 
being above that kind of procedural
because<00:04:55.180> I<00:04:55.210> think<00:04:55.390> movie<00:04:56.350> audiences<00:04:56.770> even<00:04:56.920> if

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:57.100 
because I think movie audiences even if

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:58.830 
because I think movie audiences even if
they<00:04:57.190> aren't<00:04:57.340> Formula<00:04:57.820> one<00:04:58.000> fans<00:04:58.330> or<00:04:58.630> NASCAR

00:04:58.830 --> 00:04:58.840 
they aren't Formula one fans or NASCAR

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:01.860 
they aren't Formula one fans or NASCAR
fans<00:04:59.320> know<00:04:59.919> how<00:05:00.160> this<00:05:00.370> kind<00:05:00.550> of<00:05:00.700> works<00:05:00.760> but<00:05:01.690> the

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:01.870 
fans know how this kind of works but the

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:02.879 
fans know how this kind of works but the
movie<00:05:02.140> the<00:05:02.350> movie<00:05:02.470> dies

00:05:02.879 --> 00:05:02.889 
movie the movie dies

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:04.050 
movie the movie dies
get<00:05:03.039> there<00:05:03.249> and<00:05:03.430> those<00:05:03.550> settings<00:05:03.939> are

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:04.060 
get there and those settings are

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:05.429 
get there and those settings are
wonderful<00:05:04.509> I<00:05:04.689> think<00:05:04.900> because<00:05:05.229> it's<00:05:05.379> a

00:05:05.429 --> 00:05:05.439 
wonderful I think because it's a

00:05:05.439 --> 00:05:06.839 
wonderful I think because it's a
low-budget<00:05:05.740> film<00:05:05.949> they<00:05:06.280> can't<00:05:06.460> show<00:05:06.610> you<00:05:06.669> too

00:05:06.839 --> 00:05:06.849 
low-budget film they can't show you too

00:05:06.849 --> 00:05:08.399 
low-budget film they can't show you too

kind of different vibe like I thought

00:05:12.819 --> 00:05:15.119

films Oscar chances and I feel while it

00:05:22.629 --> 00:05:25.230 
films Oscar chances and I feel while it
is<00:05:22.779> a<00:05:22.810> contender<00:05:23.409> it's<00:05:23.979> a<00:05:24.159> long<00:05:24.370> shot<00:05:24.699> but<00:05:24.969> I

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:25.240 
is a contender it's a long shot but I

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:26.399 
is a contender it's a long shot but I
feel<00:05:25.509> if<00:05:25.659> it's<00:05:25.779> going<00:05:25.960> to<00:05:26.139> get<00:05:26.229> any

00:05:26.399 --> 00:05:26.409

feel if it's going to get any
nominations<00:05:27.069> I<00:05:27.279> think<00:05:27.490> Daniel<00:05:27.759> Bruhl<00:05:28.029> is<00:05:28.180> a

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:28.210

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:29.070 
nominations I think Daniel Bruhl is a
strong<00:05:28.539> contender

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:29.080 
strong contender

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:30.600 
strong contender
I<00:05:29.229> think<00:05:29.409> cinematography<00:05:30.159> is<00:05:30.219> a<00:05:30.340> strong

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:30.610 
I think cinematography is a strong

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:32.670 
I think cinematography is a strong
contender<00:05:30.819> and<00:05:31.240> score<00:05:31.870> we've<00:05:32.319> just<00:05:32.560> been
