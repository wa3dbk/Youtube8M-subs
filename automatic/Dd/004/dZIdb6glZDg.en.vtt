00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:25.350
 hi this is raddho the video of 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:28.270
 day for the ear for good money 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.520
 relatively relatively 

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:33.100
 similar to yesterday's one since we have 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:34.989
 struggling with the average 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:38.080
 mobile 20 sessions and that we suffered a 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:41.500
 attack in good standing taking us to the 

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:43.630
 1400 48 dollars an ounce but hey there 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.970
 always this buying pressure until 

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:47.800
 watched yesterday we closed above 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:49.930
 the m7 is still closed today 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:53.770
 above the n 7 and it is the m20 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:56.410
 who is letting go in the right direction 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:57.730
 in the sense of rising so without the 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:00.760
 prejudge anything that might happen 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:01.870
 pass in the future we can see that eh 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.270
 well contrary to what could have happened 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:06.399
 happen in the past precisely when the 

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:10.119
 No. 20 dropped as was the case here 

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:11.830
 before 2 April and truly here to there there 

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:14.380
 some resistance from the 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:16.390
 buyers to follow closely 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:18.700
 on the side of gold denominated in euros 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:21.520
 now as usual the rise 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:26.320
 is 1 44% with a configuration all 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:29.799
 in fact comparable the m7 has retained the tacc 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:33.040
 bearish is one being challenged 

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:36.369
 to rise above the and 20 for 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:37.030
 money now in dollars 0.7 for 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:39.369
 hundred percent 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:41.380
 the weakness at which the money has us 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:42.700
 accustomed since not only the n 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:45.250
 va was not asked today 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:47.350
 but it's even the n 7 1 who has who 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:48.610
 is enough to make bulwark do the tension 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:50.340
 it puts us in a very bad situation 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.570
 delicate 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.130
 it's called by the way in terminology 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:56.560
 Japanese candlesticks a line of 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:58.450
 push a technically good look 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.869
 that means that there the body of the 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:03.790
 today's candle will go up but do not 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:06.460
 will not fence over half of the 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:08.220
 previous body sas well rather negative 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:11.620
 we will follow 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:14.340
 on the silver side denominated in euros 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:17.620
 to complete same configuration 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:21.310
 weakness to the mayor of the meeting in going 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:23.180
 look for the 595 euros per kilo but we 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:26.299
 ends below the m7 below 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:29.659
 wine of great fragility at the level of 

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:31.129
 areas of money one can already traced the 

00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:32.930
 little aubry who in my opinion who could 

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:35.569
 to serve us for the rest it is this one 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:39.049
 and who will probably play his role 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:40.489
 support of but still here I am you 

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:47.689
