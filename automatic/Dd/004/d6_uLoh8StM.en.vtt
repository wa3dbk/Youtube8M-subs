00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.520
 Hi, I'm the Kaiser and we're going to start 

00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:07.790
 this little tutorial on how to draw 

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:09.620
 hands and fingers that is quite simple 

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:12.200
 especially if you do not want to be pretty 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:14.769
 retailers what I do first is 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:19.070
 draw a circle and inside the circle 

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:21.830
 a square basically as a guide then 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:23.840
 I divide it into four and one of the 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:26.930
 small squares I start to draw what 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:30.190
 what would be the finger 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:34.150
 fat of the hand 

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:36.880
 then I draw the middle finger since the one that 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:38.490
 tells me that the distance along 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:40.440
 what can i get 

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:43.950
 with many do not know what size 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:48.090
 draw the fingers by the generals of the 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:49.680
 ie square to draw the palm is the 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.880
 same size a little less good 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.590
 Now I'm going to review what I said with 

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:54.590
 ink to make it look a little better 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.700
 I do not go outside in the 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:03.010
 board of the square that I made 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:05.860
 and then I go as I said starting with the 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:08.800
 big toe as they saw hate with the 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:10.180
 fingers of the hand a tip because they 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.860
 they do not know how to draw distance is all 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:13.480
 that is that they are drawing the by 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:16.240
 you saw that the fingers 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:18.580
 they have those little lines of skin 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:20.800
 obviously therefore double that serves 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:23.260
 perfect to guide us how to go doing 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:25.150
 and what size after that 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.770
 we start with the middle finger we can 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:30.210
 do the others of what the 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:30.210
 angular in ica etc. 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:37.840
 and ready we finished 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:37.840
 wrong we would do the details 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.649
 with give your own hand if you forgot in 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.649
 something 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:49.990
 and also what would be the hand this 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.990
 case to say hello 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:04.119
 now let's try to draw as 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:06.340
 it would be the clenched fist is almost the same 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:07.990
 basically all the ways to use the 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.630
 hand or how I do it is similar 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:15.180
 is to draw the square inside the 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:15.180
 circle and divide it into four parts 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.829
 Jaime remarked to make it look and what 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.420
 divided into four parts in one in the 

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:23.569
 part begins to draw what would be the 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.370
 big toe 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:27.590
 to draw the finger this part as 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:30.000
 only a small triangulation is closed 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:32.670
 thus 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.580
 and then at the top starts to 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:37.950
 draw what would be the tip of the finger 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:40.110
 it has to be more or less like that 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:43.260
 now we draw a small line for 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:45.080
 below what would be how the 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.500
 fingers 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:50.670
 centuries of age 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:52.680
 the knuckles wanted me to say 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:54.090
 well now I'm going to remark what then 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.480
 with ink so it looks a little 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.480
 best 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:01.690
 as I said the square divides it into 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:04.150
 four talked we started with the part 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:06.500
 inside the big toe the little triangle and 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:10.780
 we already have it 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:10.780
 and we do the little finger guides 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:20.730
 and now if we start a little mountain 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:24.060
 two 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:29.530
 3 and 4 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:30.879
 they did not see grace that little line that 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:33.879
 I did I can guide you if you want 

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:34.930
 they can shade it a bit to the fingers 

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:37.610
 well I'm going to leave it to us 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:39.740
 will determine now 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:42.910
 and it should be more or less and the fingers 

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:42.910
 of the closed fist 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:47.640
 I should not have shadowed our turn but I 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:50.370
 matter you understand the idea now 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:53.550
 let's draw the hand open with the fingers 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:55.769
 separated and it's good basically what 

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:57.720
 same and they saw that divided into four in 

00:03:55.769 --> 00:04:00.269
 four parts well the square by three 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:01.950
 in now it is because in passing can 

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:03.360
 locate the hand for the side you want 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:05.170
 that is, up and down and the 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:08.870
 right 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:11.750
 squared we divide it into 4 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:13.220
 on one of the fingers but on 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:15.970
 squares we start to draw what 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:15.970
 they would be the fat ones 

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:27.419
 and now we draw what would be the finger 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:29.729
 half how did you get the longest I go 

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:32.150
 to arrive and now as the hand is 

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:34.910
 extended as well as guide 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:39.380
 I started with the extreme fingers or 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:41.610
 the index and the little thumb I think 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:45.319
 thumb serves the index 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:45.319
 now remarked with ink 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:05:00.050
 As you will see it is not so difficult to draw like this 

00:04:57.229 --> 00:05:02.000
 that is not I do not know if you have to learn but 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:04.430
 see this little trick is going to be more 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.139
 easy good before you draw at this time 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:09.110
 with your hand they are like the fingers are 

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:11.570
 extended I recommend drawing 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:14.330
 then first the index finger and the 

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:17.360
 pinky since total the location of the 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:20.090
 medium fingers we can locate it in accordance 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:22.419
 at the distance that the two are 

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:22.419
 as a guide 

00:05:22.969 --> 00:05:28.179
 Well here we draw what would be the finger 

00:05:25.179 --> 00:05:28.179
 medium 

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:34.020
 and the other finger 

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:44.270
 and well there would be the way that I 

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:46.639
 I recommend to draw hands and 

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:48.470
 fingers or problem that I use so 

00:05:46.639 --> 00:05:51.440
 I know it's not the best there is another one that are 

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:53.720
 more retailers but a quick example 

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:56.840
 how to locate more already know 

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:59.750
 I repeat what I said 

00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:02.800
 so we're going fast 

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:05.979
 and maybe directly with ink 

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:08.259
 a square and a circle inside yes 

00:06:05.979 --> 00:06:11.259
 they want to better locate that square what 

00:06:08.259 --> 00:06:13.509
 we divide it into four parts and in one of 

00:06:11.259 --> 00:06:16.560
 the parties would begin what would be the 

00:06:13.509 --> 00:06:16.560
 thumb 

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:26.330
 and then how do we want to draw the 

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:28.660
 other fingers is to start with the finger 

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:28.660
 medium
