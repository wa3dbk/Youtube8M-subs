00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:10.910
 so voiced our task we have here 

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:13.240
 such a box this box with two 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:18.470
 coasters 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:26.050
 Here is the BMW X 5 from the center console BMW 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:30.620
 x5 there is a desire to build it 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:32.750
 our patient central so 

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:33.860
 called center console from 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:37.130
 chevrolet lanos 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:43.960
 we have this patient prepared for 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:47.600
 work what is the idea is that 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:51.730
 This center console has a small 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:54.559
 pocket here it can be used for 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:58.430
 trivia and for tread as in 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:01:01.030
 as a cup holder as us 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:02.149
 not satisfied with the look rather miserable 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:05.780
 impractical 

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:14.930
 there was an idea girlfriend got this 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:17.240
 boxing is very neat very interesting 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:19.580
 made the most important thing that adds 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:22.880
 practicality that is, we have an idea 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:25.130
 build it instead it's here it is like 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:29.140
 Cup holder that is something like this 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:29.140
 it will all be arranged in it 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:39.189
 idea what you need to do 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:42.700
 back cover as it turns out here 

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:44.350
 pretty ugly picture here we are 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:51.340
 donate an ashtray 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:53.819
 for this is set now I will not 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:58.810
 as the car usually does not go 

00:01:53.819 --> 00:02:00.549
 smoking people and it will all be closed already 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.970
 specially fabricated either 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:07.720
 fiberglass or plastic 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:12.630
 lid to make it all look 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:12.630
 beautiful was the most important practical 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:23.340
 the task is complicated by the fact that we have here 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:23.340
 built in more precisely 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.049
 there is a hole for the hand lever 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:32.799
 brakes 

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:36.910
 that is exactly the photo of this place 

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:39.660
 is the mechanism of the lever, respectively 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:42.910
 we can not let go much glass holders 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:48.190
 sheer overall design we will carry 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:51.400
 will be slightly higher than it is but 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:57.870
 will not hurt as the width of this box 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:03:01.269
 absolutely equal and wide 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:07.299
 it is our console that is, everything will be 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:11.500
 neatly here is how it looks like a hike 

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:16.090
 here you will take photos on that 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:19.049
 I will finally show the final video 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:19.049
 should get 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:24.980
 try to do
