00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:05.160
 these videos are traces of the passage of 

00:00:02.969 --> 00:00:08.519
 Bielsa in the back led the team to 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:10.230
 the quarterfinals at 93-94 but his 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.390
 legacy goes beyond 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:16.049
 the madman recorded and edited more than 3000 

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:18.539
 parties of mexico and the world these were 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.220
 his interpretations on paper much of the 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.199
 video I can follow you because I saw more 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.880
 videos in those four years that they 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.520
 you want in my life not always 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.550
 I can essentially tell you that I saw no 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:31.740
 I know it's eight matches a day in a 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.440
 occasion that the tournament was suspended for 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.390
 some match of the Mexican national team 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.890
 his in-laws were here and I told him that 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.260
 If you wanted to know puerto vallarta 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.329
 We went to puerto vallarta when we arrived at 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.610
 hotel to register he asked us two 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:47.730
 VCRs in your room two 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.469
 VCRs and they brought a box 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.120
 I remember that our next match 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.700
 from against puebla pára 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.430
 approximately 20 village parties 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:58.789
 the last 20 matches of puebla and in 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.800
 one left the room had the father-in-law 

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:04.289
 crushed and pointed that dictated 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:07.270
 in a guy who knew very well how to do 

00:01:04.289 --> 00:01:09.969
 communication work as soon as 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:12.280
 up to the station of lowest rating up 

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:14.920
 the station with the highest rating and I knew 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.170
 who wrote in danger that less 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:18.390
 it was sold 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.970
 who was selling the most and he was in 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:24.210
 almost almost I can tell you that I was going to 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.979
 the court and analyzed 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.000
 the field was well cut if it was 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.680
 well scratched 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.060
 I was wondering a lot about the Mexican 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.100
 Once they had arrived and leaving the 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.350
 I was the technician is how are the 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.280
 Mexicans like the sixth but before 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.100
 that will already be seen 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.320
 sucked a book of how the Mexican the 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.810
 same bielsa who regrets never having a 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:46.830
 party to have fun came to america 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:49.860
 in 1995 the short projects club 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:52.619
 he thought of a long- term effort but 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:56.280
 the hard exercise failed until the day 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:58.890
 35 returned to the atlas to leave the last 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.810
 calligraphy of his personality that he had 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.959
 logically descriptions with a lot 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.459
 people because this one with players 

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:07.200
 inclusive that they came already with the player 

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:09.780
 that the turbo muñoz is coming, I think 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.209
 they talked for five minutes and the 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.060
 player in which the player returned in 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:16.520
 sometime 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.470
 can get tired of that demand 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:21.950
 of demand in each training in 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:23.780
 every game but but when they see the 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.040
 results that at the end of accounts almost 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.750
 they always accompany him 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.790
 Normally the player also wants 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:31.730
 be a winner he worked a lot 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:34.489
 the court marked with elastics by 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:37.819
 areas as he called him then they had 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:39.590
 marked to where to go to 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:42.980
 defend where to go with the 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:45.230
 ball race how to make up a 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:47.810
 get to center have still 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:49.250
 marked by different positions 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.530
 defense of deserved front what 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:54.110
 they have to do the atlas left him 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:56.420
 very much because it is still talking about him 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:58.580
 as a seed at a given moment that 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:00.500
 he gave a very important value to 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:01.940
 many young players that are 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:05.819
 they started using from the 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:08.280
 arrival of him and he did not touch 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:11.489
 and harvest the fruits like us 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:13.739
 neither of all his work seems that 20 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:16.139
 years is nothing but this man has 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:19.230
 made a revolution in argentina in 

00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:22.040
 chile in spain and on all the courts 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:22.040
 who has stepped on
