00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
discussion of GIMP with a very important

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.810 
discussion of GIMP with a very important
topic<00:00:30.840> and<00:00:31.230> that's<00:00:31.320> called<00:00:31.680> the<00:00:31.830> path<00:00:32.490> tool

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
topic and that's called the path tool

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:38.390 
topic and that's called the path tool
the<00:00:33.780> path<00:00:34.020> tool<00:00:34.380> is<00:00:34.790> right<00:00:35.790> here<00:00:36.210> and<00:00:37.400> it's

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:38.400 
the path tool is right here and it's

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.990 
the path tool is right here and it's
otherwise<00:00:39.180> known<00:00:39.540> as<00:00:39.840> the<00:00:39.930> Bezier<00:00:40.620> tool<00:00:41.000> and

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
otherwise known as the Bezier tool and

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.940 
otherwise known as the Bezier tool and
I'll<00:00:42.600> show<00:00:42.809> you<00:00:42.840> why<00:00:43.080> in<00:00:43.110> just<00:00:43.230> a<00:00:43.500> second<00:00:43.890> the

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
I'll show you why in just a second the

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.299 
I'll show you why in just a second the
Bezier<00:00:44.250> curve<00:00:44.610> tool<00:00:45.680> what<00:00:46.680> we're<00:00:46.830> going<00:00:47.040> to<00:00:47.100> do

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
Bezier curve tool what we're going to do

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.910 
Bezier curve tool what we're going to do
is<00:00:47.430> the<00:00:47.489> best<00:00:47.640> way<00:00:47.850> to<00:00:48.110> perhaps<00:00:49.110> get<00:00:49.470> into<00:00:49.770> it

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
is the best way to perhaps get into it

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.689 
is the best way to perhaps get into it
is<00:00:50.100> just<00:00:50.370> create<00:00:51.239> one<00:00:51.830> so<00:00:52.830> now<00:00:53.010> what<00:00:53.370> I'm<00:00:53.460> going

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
is just create one so now what I'm going

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.620 
is just create one so now what I'm going
to<00:00:53.790> do<00:00:54.000> here<00:00:54.360> is<00:00:54.540> I'm<00:00:55.140> going<00:00:55.350> to<00:00:55.470> go<00:00:55.680> into<00:00:56.130> new

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:56.630 
to do here is I'm going to go into new

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:59.680 
to do here is I'm going to go into new
I'm<00:00:57.630> going<00:00:57.810> to<00:00:57.870> create<00:00:57.989> it<00:00:58.079> I<00:00:58.410> created<00:00:58.800> a<00:00:58.920> new

00:00:59.680 --> 00:00:59.690 
I'm going to create it I created a new

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:04.040 
I'm going to create it I created a new
canvas<00:01:00.690> with<00:01:00.960> a<00:01:00.989> workspace<00:01:01.710> of<00:01:01.739> 640<00:01:02.660> by<00:01:03.660> 480

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:04.050 
canvas with a workspace of 640 by 480

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:08.740 
canvas with a workspace of 640 by 480
I'm<00:01:04.410> going<00:01:04.559> to<00:01:04.649> say<00:01:04.800> okay<00:01:05.960> bring<00:01:06.960> it<00:01:07.050> over<00:01:07.259> here

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:08.750 
I'm going to say okay bring it over here

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:10.999 
I'm going to say okay bring it over here
resize<00:01:09.750> it<00:01:10.020> slight<00:01:10.259> way<00:01:10.440> to<00:01:10.500> give<00:01:10.710> us<00:01:10.830> a<00:01:10.890> little

00:01:10.999 --> 00:01:11.009 
resize it slight way to give us a little

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:14.660 
resize it slight way to give us a little
bit<00:01:11.160> more<00:01:11.369> screen<00:01:11.670> real<00:01:11.729> estate<00:01:13.250> move<00:01:14.250> it<00:01:14.369> over

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
bit more screen real estate move it over

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.280 
bit more screen real estate move it over
and<00:01:14.899> I'm<00:01:15.899> going<00:01:16.170> to<00:01:16.320> go<00:01:17.310> into<00:01:17.490> edit<00:01:17.700> and<00:01:18.290> fill

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
and I'm going to go into edit and fill

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.010 
and I'm going to go into edit and fill
with<00:01:19.410> a<00:01:19.470> foreground<00:01:19.890> color<00:01:20.190> which<00:01:20.399> is<00:01:21.020> you

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
with a foreground color which is you

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.300 
with a foreground color which is you
know<00:01:22.140> a<00:01:22.170> light<00:01:22.470> blue<00:01:22.710> I<00:01:22.740> don't<00:01:22.860> like<00:01:23.100> to<00:01:23.220> rig

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
know a light blue I don't like to rig

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.480 
know a light blue I don't like to rig
blue<00:01:24.320> so<00:01:25.320> you'll<00:01:25.500> notice<00:01:25.800> when<00:01:25.979> we<00:01:26.040> select

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
blue so you'll notice when we select

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.370 
blue so you'll notice when we select
this<00:01:26.729> path<00:01:27.420> tool<00:01:29.000> we<00:01:30.000> have<00:01:30.030> a<00:01:30.209> design<00:01:30.630> edit<00:01:31.170> and

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
this path tool we have a design edit and

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.600 
this path tool we have a design edit and
a<00:01:31.440> move<00:01:31.619> mode<00:01:32.569> the<00:01:33.569> path<00:01:33.780> tool<00:01:34.110> allows<00:01:34.979> pass<00:01:35.340> to

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
a move mode the path tool allows pass to

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.419 
a move mode the path tool allows pass to
be<00:01:35.700> created<00:01:36.060> by<00:01:36.149> a<00:01:36.179> series<00:01:36.569> of<00:01:36.600> points<00:01:37.200> that

00:01:37.419 --> 00:01:37.429 
be created by a series of points that

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:40.010 
be created by a series of points that
appear<00:01:38.429> to<00:01:38.729> be<00:01:38.910> connected<00:01:39.179> by<00:01:39.479> straight<00:01:39.780> lines

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
appear to be connected by straight lines

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.469 
appear to be connected by straight lines
but<00:01:40.229> actually<00:01:40.619> they're<00:01:40.800> curves<00:01:41.179> so<00:01:42.179> I<00:01:42.240> have<00:01:42.360> to

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
but actually they're curves so I have to

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:43.969 
but actually they're curves so I have to

if<00:02:36.849> we<00:02:37.000> click<00:02:37.450> on<00:02:37.690> that<00:02:37.750> point<00:02:38.290> and<00:02:38.680> if<00:02:39.459> we<00:02:39.610> drag

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
if we click on that point and if we drag

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:42.780 
if we click on that point and if we drag
over<00:02:40.349> what<00:02:41.349> happens<00:02:41.799> is<00:02:41.950> we<00:02:42.099> get<00:02:42.250> a<00:02:42.310> control

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
over what happens is we get a control

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:46.410 
over what happens is we get a control
handle<00:02:43.209> and<00:02:43.420> the<00:02:44.349> control<00:02:44.769> handle<00:02:45.220> as<00:02:45.430> we<00:02:46.150> drag

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
handle and the control handle as we drag

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.210 
handle and the control handle as we drag
it<00:02:46.540> away<00:02:46.750> from<00:02:46.930> the<00:02:47.080> point<00:02:47.349> increases<00:02:47.890> the

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
it away from the point increases the

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:52.199 
it away from the point increases the
amplitude<00:02:48.430> of<00:02:49.120> the<00:02:49.780> arc<00:02:49.989> and<00:02:50.489> as<00:02:51.489> we<00:02:51.790> move<00:02:52.000> it

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:52.209 
amplitude of the arc and as we move it

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:55.080 
amplitude of the arc and as we move it
orbit<00:02:52.690> around<00:02:53.140> the<00:02:53.319> point<00:02:53.560> it<00:02:54.430> establishes

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
orbit around the point it establishes

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:59.220 
orbit around the point it establishes
the<00:02:55.299> entry<00:02:55.870> point<00:02:56.200> into<00:02:56.890> that<00:02:57.579> point<00:02:58.230> so

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
the entry point into that point so

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.500 
the entry point into that point so
basically<00:02:59.260> the<00:02:59.829> control<00:03:00.160> handle<00:03:00.610> is<00:03:00.849> if

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
basically the control handle is if

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:04.920 
basically the control handle is if
you'll<00:03:01.690> notice<00:03:01.930> is<00:03:02.349> as<00:03:03.250> we<00:03:03.519> move<00:03:03.730> around<00:03:04.060> it's

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
you'll notice is as we move around it's

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.740 
you'll notice is as we move around it's
defining<00:03:05.410> the<00:03:05.620> entry<00:03:05.950> point<00:03:06.220> as<00:03:06.459> we<00:03:07.390> move<00:03:07.599> it

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750 
defining the entry point as we move it

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:13.680 
defining the entry point as we move it
out<00:03:07.950> it<00:03:08.950> defines<00:03:09.430> the<00:03:09.579> arc<00:03:11.310> if<00:03:12.310> okay<00:03:13.299> so<00:03:13.360> this

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.690 
out it defines the arc if okay so this

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:15.420 
out it defines the arc if okay so this
is<00:03:13.930> to<00:03:14.110> the<00:03:14.140> point<00:03:14.470> to<00:03:14.590> the<00:03:14.709> left<00:03:14.890> if<00:03:15.130> you<00:03:15.250> go<00:03:15.370> to

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
is to the point to the left if you go to

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:17.729 
is to the point to the left if you go to
the<00:03:15.579> point<00:03:15.760> to<00:03:15.970> the<00:03:16.030> left<00:03:16.120> or<00:03:17.019> the<00:03:17.200> entry<00:03:17.560> or

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:17.739 
the point to the left or the entry or

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:21.000 
the point to the left or the entry or
the<00:03:17.890> line<00:03:18.579> to<00:03:18.819> the<00:03:18.880> left<00:03:19.139> if<00:03:20.139> we<00:03:20.319> click<00:03:20.590> on<00:03:20.620> it

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
the line to the left if we click on it

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:26.099 
the line to the left if we click on it
and<00:03:21.160> go<00:03:21.579> to<00:03:21.609> the<00:03:21.760> right<00:03:22.650> we<00:03:24.870> establish<00:03:25.870> the

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:26.109 
and go to the right we establish the

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:28.770 
and go to the right we establish the
line<00:03:26.459> by<00:03:27.459> the<00:03:27.489> entry<00:03:28.000> point<00:03:28.239> for<00:03:28.329> the<00:03:28.510> line

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:28.780 
line by the entry point for the line

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:33.140 
line by the entry point for the line
that<00:03:29.590> it's<00:03:29.769> intersecting<00:03:30.519> from<00:03:30.760> the<00:03:30.880> right<00:03:31.530> so

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
that it's intersecting from the right so

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:36.530 
that it's intersecting from the right so
again<00:03:34.150> moving<00:03:34.840> away<00:03:34.989> from<00:03:35.920> that<00:03:36.160> point

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
again moving away from that point

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:40.920 
again moving away from that point
defines<00:03:37.540> the<00:03:37.720> amplitude<00:03:38.350> and<00:03:39.810> orbiting<00:03:40.810> the

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:40.930 
defines the amplitude and orbiting the

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:44.600 
defines the amplitude and orbiting the
point<00:03:41.400> defines<00:03:42.400> the<00:03:42.639> entry<00:03:42.970> point

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:44.610 
point defines the entry point

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:48.150 
point defines the entry point
if<00:03:45.610> we<00:03:45.850> go<00:03:46.000> into<00:03:46.180> the<00:03:46.420> move<00:03:46.600> mode<00:03:46.980> what<00:03:47.980> we're

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:48.160 
if we go into the move mode what we're

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.980 
if we go into the move mode what we're
basically<00:03:48.280> going<00:03:48.850> to<00:03:48.970> do<00:03:49.270> is<00:03:49.510> be<00:03:50.470> able<00:03:50.620> to<00:03:51.010> move

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:51.990 
basically going to do is be able to move

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:55.400 
basically going to do is be able to move
this<00:03:52.990> entire<00:03:53.440> structure

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.410 
this entire structure

00:03:55.410 --> 00:04:00.270 
this entire structure
so<00:03:56.410> remember<00:03:57.120> design<00:03:58.120> mode<00:03:58.560> allows<00:03:59.560> us<00:03:59.920> to

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:00.280 
so remember design mode allows us to

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:05.190 
so remember design mode allows us to
create<00:04:01.210> the<00:04:01.420> points<00:04:02.670> edit<00:04:03.670> modes<00:04:03.990> edit<00:04:04.990> mode

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:05.200 
create the points edit modes edit mode

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:07.970 
create the points edit modes edit mode
allows<00:04:05.800> us<00:04:06.070> to<00:04:06.250> establish<00:04:06.430> new<00:04:07.060> points<00:04:07.540> and

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980 
allows us to establish new points and

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:11.190 
allows us to establish new points and
also<00:04:09.120> control<00:04:10.120> points<00:04:10.570> through<00:04:10.720> the<00:04:10.810> control

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:11.200 
also control points through the control

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:14.820 
also control points through the control
handles<00:04:11.640> and<00:04:12.640> move<00:04:12.910> allows<00:04:13.300> us<00:04:13.570> to<00:04:13.780> move<00:04:14.020> the

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:14.830 
handles and move allows us to move the

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:18.900 
handles and move allows us to move the
entire<00:04:15.160> structure<00:04:17.010> now<00:04:18.010> let's<00:04:18.459> say<00:04:18.640> we're<00:04:18.820> in

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:18.910 
entire structure now let's say we're in

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:21.690 
entire structure now let's say we're in
edit<00:04:19.150> mode<00:04:19.180> and<00:04:19.720> we<00:04:20.500> choose<00:04:20.770> to<00:04:21.130> add<00:04:21.430> a<00:04:21.459> new

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:21.700 
edit mode and we choose to add a new

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:23.510

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 
point we just come over on the line

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:27.380 
point we just come over on the line
click<00:04:24.520> on<00:04:24.700> that<00:04:24.940> point<00:04:25.240> and<00:04:25.630> if<00:04:26.380> you'll<00:04:26.560> notice

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:27.390 
click on that point and if you'll notice

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:31.260 
click on that point and if you'll notice
we<00:04:28.390> can<00:04:28.510> go<00:04:28.690> back<00:04:28.870> into<00:04:29.110> design<00:04:29.380> mode<00:04:29.680> and<00:04:30.270> move

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:31.270 
we can go back into design mode and move

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:35.100 
we can go back into design mode and move
those<00:04:31.570> points<00:04:33.870> okay

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:35.110 
those points okay

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:40.790 
those points okay
around<00:04:36.120> or<00:04:37.120> we<00:04:37.870> can<00:04:38.050> go<00:04:38.200> into<00:04:38.670> edit<00:04:39.670> mode<00:04:39.940> and

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:40.800 
around or we can go into edit mode and

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:46.080 
around or we can go into edit mode and
we<00:04:41.800> can<00:04:42.720> define<00:04:44.070> both<00:04:45.070> the<00:04:45.250> curve<00:04:45.430> amplitude

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:46.090 
we can define both the curve amplitude

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:50.100 
we can define both the curve amplitude
and<00:04:46.360> the<00:04:46.960> entry<00:04:47.260> point<00:04:47.560> into<00:04:47.800> that<00:04:48.130> mode<00:04:49.110> so

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:50.110 
and the entry point into that mode so

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:52.940 
and the entry point into that mode so
we've<00:04:50.290> covered<00:04:50.770> the<00:04:51.040> design<00:04:51.400> edit<00:04:52.270> and<00:04:52.450> move

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:52.950 
we've covered the design edit and move

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:58.740 
we've covered the design edit and move
points<00:04:53.950> on<00:04:54.100> the<00:04:55.050> path<00:04:56.050> selection<00:04:56.320> tool<00:04:57.270> now<00:04:58.270> we

00:04:58.740 --> 00:04:58.750 
points on the path selection tool now we

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:01.800 
points on the path selection tool now we
have<00:04:58.990> this<00:04:59.200> right<00:04:59.470> here<00:04:59.800> what<00:05:00.010> we<00:05:00.160> can<00:05:00.310> do<00:05:00.810> is

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:01.810 
have this right here what we can do is

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:03.240 
have this right here what we can do is
we<00:05:01.990> have<00:05:02.080> two<00:05:02.230> additional<00:05:02.440> buttons<00:05:03.040> at<00:05:03.190> the

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:03.250 
we have two additional buttons at the

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:07.200 
we have two additional buttons at the
bottom<00:05:03.840> we<00:05:04.840> can<00:05:05.340> create<00:05:06.340> a<00:05:06.460> selection<00:05:06.820> from

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:07.210 
bottom we can create a selection from

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:10.080 
bottom we can create a selection from
the<00:05:07.300> path<00:05:07.630> which<00:05:08.560> is<00:05:08.590> done<00:05:08.860> by<00:05:08.890> here<00:05:09.370> I<00:05:09.520> hope

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:10.090 
the path which is done by here I hope

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:12.540 
the path which is done by here I hope
you<00:05:10.210> notice<00:05:10.510> we<00:05:10.630> get<00:05:10.750> the<00:05:10.900> marching<00:05:11.290> ants<00:05:11.550> so

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:12.550 
you notice we get the marching ants so

number of pixels

00:05:49.889 --> 00:05:54.080 
number of pixels
so<00:05:50.550> we'll<00:05:50.699> do<00:05:50.849> 13<00:05:51.479> and<00:05:51.840> we'll<00:05:52.020> say<00:05:52.229> okay<00:05:52.939> now<00:05:53.939> if

00:06:01.939 --> 00:06:01.949 
a soft edge and we'll do a ctrl Z and if

00:06:01.949 --> 00:06:07.730 
a soft edge and we'll do a ctrl Z and if
we<00:06:02.099> come<00:06:02.340> up<00:06:02.370> to<00:06:03.800> the<00:06:04.909> select<00:06:05.909> again<00:06:06.560> go<00:06:07.560> into

we come up to the select again go into

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:11.659 
we come up to the select again go into
feather<00:06:08.069> and<00:06:08.750> increase<00:06:09.750> the<00:06:10.669> feather

selection to 30 and we hit OK and now if

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:20.499 
selection to 30 and we hit OK and now if
we<00:06:16.860> do<00:06:17.069> a<00:06:17.099> delete<00:06:17.490> there's<00:06:18.449> a<00:06:18.569> much<00:06:18.840> more

00:06:20.499 --> 00:06:20.509 
we do a delete there's a much more

00:06:20.509 --> 00:06:24.279 
we do a delete there's a much more
feathered<00:06:21.509> edge<00:06:22.099> so<00:06:23.099> we<00:06:23.250> can<00:06:23.400> do<00:06:23.490> a<00:06:23.520> ctrl<00:06:23.969> Z<00:06:24.180> to

00:06:24.279 --> 00:06:24.289 
feathered edge so we can do a ctrl Z to

00:06:24.289 --> 00:06:28.459 
feathered edge so we can do a ctrl Z to
undo<00:06:26.330> this<00:06:27.330> also<00:06:27.810> works<00:06:28.020> with<00:06:28.199> the<00:06:28.319> other
