magnaflow exhaust I mean it's a pretty

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.910 
magnaflow exhaust I mean it's a pretty
trick<00:00:30.160> car<00:00:31.259> right<00:00:32.259> now<00:00:32.290> we're<00:00:32.590> just<00:00:32.619> getting

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:32.920 
trick car right now we're just getting

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.529 
trick car right now we're just getting
ready<00:00:32.980> to<00:00:33.219> pull<00:00:33.579> down<00:00:33.610> the<00:00:33.910> transmission<00:00:34.420> so

00:00:34.529 --> 00:00:34.539 
ready to pull down the transmission so

00:00:34.539 --> 00:00:36.150 
ready to pull down the transmission so
we<00:00:34.629> got<00:00:34.719> to<00:00:34.809> take<00:00:34.930> down<00:00:35.140> all<00:00:35.170> the<00:00:35.410> systems<00:00:36.039> are

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:36.160 
we got to take down all the systems are

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:37.410 
we got to take down all the systems are
complementary<00:00:36.730> to<00:00:36.760> up<00:00:36.969> we've<00:00:37.120> got<00:00:37.149> to<00:00:37.300> work

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:37.420 
complementary to up we've got to work

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:39.119 
complementary to up we've got to work
from<00:00:37.510> the<00:00:37.600> driveshaft<00:00:38.079> exhaust<00:00:38.559> and

00:00:39.119 --> 00:00:39.129 
from the driveshaft exhaust and

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:40.560 
from the driveshaft exhaust and
basically<00:00:39.579> get<00:00:39.789> it<00:00:39.879> so<00:00:39.999> they<00:00:40.089> can<00:00:40.210> pull<00:00:40.359> drive

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:40.570 
basically get it so they can pull drive

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:42.479 
basically get it so they can pull drive
the<00:00:40.809> driveline<00:00:41.289> out<00:00:41.649> of<00:00:41.710> the<00:00:41.769> vehicle<00:00:41.949> and<00:00:42.309> put

00:00:42.479 --> 00:00:42.489 
the driveline out of the vehicle and put

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:45.299 
the driveline out of the vehicle and put
the<00:00:42.579> ETD<00:00:42.820> clutch<00:00:43.120> in<00:00:43.499> one<00:00:44.499> of<00:00:44.530> the<00:00:44.710> reasons<00:00:45.100> why

00:00:45.299 --> 00:00:45.309 
the ETD clutch in one of the reasons why

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:47.520 
the ETD clutch in one of the reasons why
we're<00:00:45.519> putting<00:00:45.730> on<00:00:46.030> the<00:00:46.449> optimal<00:00:47.170> that

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:47.530 
we're putting on the optimal that

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:49.439 
we're putting on the optimal that
streetcar<00:00:48.100> invitational<00:00:48.789> is<00:00:48.819> because<00:00:49.210> we

00:00:49.439 --> 00:00:49.449 
streetcar invitational is because we

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:50.819 
streetcar invitational is because we
really<00:00:49.749> want<00:00:49.780> to<00:00:50.050> prove<00:00:50.230> that<00:00:50.499> we're<00:00:50.649> putting

00:00:50.819 --> 00:00:50.829 
really want to prove that we're putting

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:54.149 
really want to prove that we're putting
performance<00:00:51.550> back<00:00:51.760> into<00:00:52.089> the<00:00:52.210> industry<00:00:53.159> we

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:54.159 
performance back into the industry we

00:00:54.159 --> 00:00:59.119 
performance back into the industry we
beat<00:00:54.460> on<00:00:54.670> it<00:00:54.699> put<00:00:55.239> it<00:00:55.300> to<00:00:55.510> the<00:00:55.539> test<00:00:55.809> it's<00:00:56.649> ready

go fast but Tanner wasn't happy with
that<00:01:55.320> and<00:01:56.190> he<00:01:56.850> wanted<00:01:57.090> to<00:01:57.149> drift<00:01:57.509> it<00:01:57.690> hey<00:01:58.020> can

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
that and he wanted to drift it hey can

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.540 
that and he wanted to drift it hey can
we<00:01:58.289> pull<00:01:58.500> the<00:01:58.619> fuse<00:01:58.920> on<00:01:58.950> that<00:01:59.250> traction

00:01:59.540 --> 00:01:59.550 
we pull the fuse on that traction

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:00.800 
we pull the fuse on that traction
control<00:01:59.789> because<00:02:00.149> it<00:02:00.270> just<00:02:00.390> turns<00:02:00.630> itself

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
control because it just turns itself

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.279 
control because it just turns itself
back<00:02:01.170> on<00:02:01.229> ok<00:02:01.950> once<00:02:02.789> they<00:02:02.970> pulled<00:02:03.180> the<00:02:03.330> fuse<00:02:03.539> he

00:02:04.279 --> 00:02:04.289 
back on ok once they pulled the fuse he

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:10.370 
back on ok once they pulled the fuse he
lit<00:02:04.740> up<00:02:05.039> the<00:02:05.100> autocross<00:02:06.000> course<00:02:09.380> well

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:10.380 
lit up the autocross course well

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.100 
lit up the autocross course well
Tanner's<00:02:10.619> REM<00:02:10.950> was<00:02:11.190> amazing<00:02:11.940> I<00:02:12.060> mean<00:02:12.090> you<00:02:12.989> know

through<00:02:21.690> cones<00:02:22.350> that<00:02:22.709> are<00:02:22.769> you<00:02:23.220> know<00:02:23.310> in<00:02:23.459> some

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
through cones that are you know in some

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.750 
through cones that are you know in some
places<00:02:23.970> 10<00:02:24.420> feet<00:02:24.720> apart<00:02:24.870> I<00:02:25.380> mean<00:02:25.860> it's<00:02:26.070> like
