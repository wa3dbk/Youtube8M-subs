ring finger down low don't hold it with
them<00:01:44.460> so<00:01:44.640> high<00:01:44.900> kind<00:01:45.900> of<00:01:45.960> hold<00:01:46.140> them<00:01:46.229> down<00:01:46.470> a

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
them so high kind of hold them down a

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.219

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.239 
the card isn't in the palm of my hand
but<00:02:07.619> ma<00:02:08.360> my<00:02:09.360> ring<00:02:09.869> finger<00:02:10.319> is<00:02:10.499> holding<00:02:10.950> it

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:11.249 
but ma my ring finger is holding it

00:02:11.249 --> 00:02:14.309 
but ma my ring finger is holding it
there<00:02:11.430> and<00:02:11.609> it's<00:02:11.999> allowing<00:02:12.620> my<00:02:13.620> hand<00:02:13.889> to<00:02:14.040> kind

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:14.319 
there and it's allowing my hand to kind

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:17.039 
there and it's allowing my hand to kind
wave<00:02:14.620> over<00:02:15.129> the<00:02:15.159> deck<00:02:15.569> it<00:02:16.569> kind<00:02:16.780> of<00:02:16.840> gives<00:02:16.989> a

00:02:17.039 --> 00:02:17.049 
wave over the deck it kind of gives a

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:18.420 
wave over the deck it kind of gives a
different<00:02:17.379> illusion<00:02:17.769> and<00:02:17.920> then<00:02:18.010> you<00:02:18.159> can<00:02:18.280> just

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
different illusion and then you can just

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.069 
different illusion and then you can just
bring<00:02:18.639> it<00:02:18.790> across<00:02:19.030> and<00:02:19.299> then<00:02:19.420> you<00:02:19.540> can<00:02:19.689> square

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:20.079 
bring it across and then you can square

00:02:20.079 --> 00:02:22.949 
bring it across and then you can square
it<00:02:20.109> up<00:02:20.319> and<00:02:20.650> either<00:02:21.639> change<00:02:22.060> it<00:02:22.180> that<00:02:22.359> way<00:02:22.569> or

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959 
it up and either change it that way or

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:24.690 
it up and either change it that way or
you<00:02:23.499> know<00:02:23.530> when<00:02:23.829> you<00:02:23.920> change<00:02:24.189> it<00:02:24.340> up<00:02:24.430> you<00:02:24.459> can

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
you know when you change it up you can

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.750 
you know when you change it up you can
pull<00:02:25.060> it<00:02:25.209> down<00:02:25.239> and<00:02:25.599> square<00:02:26.200> it<00:02:26.290> to<00:02:26.319> the<00:02:26.499> deck

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
pull it down and square it to the deck

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.660 
pull it down and square it to the deck
so<00:02:27.810> that<00:02:28.810> is<00:02:29.049> a<00:02:29.079> just<00:02:30.069> kind<00:02:30.400> of<00:02:30.430> a<00:02:30.519> little

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
so that is a just kind of a little

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:32.490 
so that is a just kind of a little
variation<00:02:31.030> to<00:02:31.420> the<00:02:31.540> erdan<00:02:31.810> exchange<00:02:32.200> which<00:02:32.379> I

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
variation to the erdan exchange which I

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.349 
variation to the erdan exchange which I
like<00:02:32.680> to<00:02:32.829> use<00:02:33.040> because<00:02:33.639> then<00:02:33.909> it<00:02:34.030> doesn't<00:02:34.060> look

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:34.359 
like to use because then it doesn't look

00:02:34.359 --> 00:02:35.610 
like to use because then it doesn't look
like<00:02:34.569> you're<00:02:34.719> just<00:02:34.900> pulling<00:02:35.079> straight<00:02:35.409> back

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
like you're just pulling straight back

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:37.440 
like you're just pulling straight back
and<00:02:35.829> then<00:02:35.920> going<00:02:36.250> forward<00:02:36.519> and<00:02:36.849> you<00:02:37.420> know

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
and then going forward and you know

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.569 
and then going forward and you know
squaring<00:02:38.049> up<00:02:38.200> is<00:02:38.379> I<00:02:38.590> don't<00:02:38.920> know<00:02:39.040> to<00:02:39.310> me<00:02:39.430> this

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:39.579 
squaring up is I don't know to me this

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:42.089 
squaring up is I don't know to me this
is<00:02:39.760> kind<00:02:39.939> of<00:02:40.030> boring<00:02:40.299> but<00:02:40.569> if<00:02:41.439> you<00:02:41.650> do<00:02:41.769> the<00:02:41.919> same

00:02:42.089 --> 00:02:42.099 
is kind of boring but if you do the same

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:44.280 
is kind of boring but if you do the same
move<00:02:42.370> where<00:02:42.549> you<00:02:42.609> push<00:02:42.790> it<00:02:42.969> forward<00:02:43.329> slide<00:02:44.139> the

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
move where you push it forward slide the

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:46.920 
move where you push it forward slide the
card<00:02:44.530> out<00:02:45.120> transfer<00:02:46.120> it<00:02:46.239> over<00:02:46.299> to<00:02:46.480> your<00:02:46.719> ring

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:06.969 
it's it's used a lot it's very simple

00:03:06.969 --> 00:03:09.629 
it's it's used a lot it's very simple
and<00:03:07.269> if<00:03:08.049> you<00:03:08.230> use<00:03:08.530> this<00:03:08.829> technique<00:03:09.340> you<00:03:09.519> can

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:09.639

hand away from the deck so it actually

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:16.140 
hand away from the deck so it actually
looks<00:03:13.540> a<00:03:14.500> little<00:03:14.889> bit<00:03:15.219> more<00:03:15.459> convincing<00:03:15.819> I

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
looks a little bit more convincing I

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:19.050 
looks a little bit more convincing I
kind<00:03:16.449> of<00:03:16.540> like<00:03:16.629> to<00:03:16.780> do<00:03:16.900> it<00:03:17.019> that<00:03:17.169> way<00:03:17.430> and<00:03:18.430> that

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
kind of like to do it that way and that

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:22.710 
kind of like to do it that way and that
is<00:03:20.220> that's<00:03:21.220> how<00:03:21.430> I<00:03:21.459> like<00:03:21.759> to<00:03:21.790> perform<00:03:22.060> it<00:03:22.419> to<00:03:22.599> me
