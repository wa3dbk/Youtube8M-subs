Hello! Welcome back! 
This video is in collaboration with another youtuber: SweetBioDesign.
We decided to make a card with christmas colors.

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:53.960
I made this card, using red as principal color.
It's very simple to make but particular and nice, with unusual open that i'll show you in the video.

00:00:53.960 --> 00:01:10.240

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:25.000
Take a paper of 160 gr in the color that you like: I choosed red.
Then halve it.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:02:13.440
Give a particular form to the paper, using the Big Shot and a Sizzix die-cutting (Rectangle Flip-its, link in the info box), as shown in the video.

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:34.600
Now fold it.

00:02:34.600 --> 00:03:34.400
Decorate the card with a christmas scrap paper.
Outline the shape of the card on the paper, then cut it.

00:03:34.400 --> 00:04:05.680
Glue to the card with double sided tape.

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:39.200
Decorate the central part, according with your taste.

00:04:39.200 --> 00:05:20.160
Add more decorations: I added a red ribbon and strass.

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:26.920
Thanks for watching! 
Stay tuned for the next tutorial! Bye bye
