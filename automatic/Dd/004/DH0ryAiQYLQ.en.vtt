that<00:01:33.299> out<00:01:33.479> Arum<00:01:33.960> just<00:01:34.200> makes<00:01:34.409> it<00:01:34.560> really<00:01:34.710> easy

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
else it might I mean it definitely last

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.589 
else it might I mean it definitely last
longer<00:02:34.540> on<00:02:34.690> me<00:02:35.050> than<00:02:35.349> most<00:02:35.860> self<00:02:36.730> tanners<00:02:37.239> so

00:02:37.589 --> 00:02:37.599 
longer on me than most self tanners so

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:41.339 
longer on me than most self tanners so
that's<00:02:38.260> definitely<00:02:38.530> a<00:02:38.830> positive<00:02:39.209> and<00:02:40.209> like<00:02:41.200> I

00:02:41.339 --> 00:02:41.349 
that's definitely a positive and like I

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:43.949 
that's definitely a positive and like I
said<00:02:41.410> this<00:02:41.739> is<00:02:41.920> the<00:02:42.040> medium<00:02:42.370> to<00:02:42.549> tan<00:02:42.819> so<00:02:43.269> I<00:02:43.299> mean

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:43.959 
said this is the medium to tan so I mean

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:45.839 
said this is the medium to tan so I mean
it<00:02:44.140> dot<00:02:44.349> when<00:02:44.560> you<00:02:44.680> put<00:02:44.860> it<00:02:44.980> on<00:02:45.129> it<00:02:45.370> does<00:02:45.580> give

00:02:45.839 --> 00:02:45.849 
it dot when you put it on it does give

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:48.059 
it dot when you put it on it does give
you<00:02:45.970> instant<00:02:46.360> color<00:02:46.630> and<00:02:47.080> then<00:02:47.260> it<00:02:47.290> does<00:02:47.769> you

00:02:48.059 --> 00:02:48.069 
you instant color and then it does you

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:50.970 
you instant color and then it does you
know<00:02:48.190> gradually<00:02:48.819> turn<00:02:49.060> into<00:02:49.540> a<00:02:49.810> tan<00:02:50.349> the<00:02:50.769> thing

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
know gradually turn into a tan the thing

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:52.440 
know gradually turn into a tan the thing

exfoliated<00:02:59.590> after<00:03:00.099> applying<00:03:00.640> but<00:03:01.060> this<00:03:01.360> will

00:03:01.559 --> 00:03:01.569 
exfoliated after applying but this will

turn your hands super Orange within

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.460 
turn your hands super Orange within
minutes<00:03:04.060> so<00:03:04.569> you're<00:03:04.780> gonna<00:03:04.900> want<00:03:05.200> to<00:03:05.260> wash

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
minutes so you're gonna want to wash

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.800 
minutes so you're gonna want to wash
your<00:03:05.500> hands<00:03:05.829> really<00:03:06.069> really<00:03:06.459> good<00:03:06.700> and<00:03:06.910> even

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
your hands really really good and even

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:10.500 
your hands really really good and even
like<00:03:08.140> use<00:03:08.410> a<00:03:08.440> loofah<00:03:09.040> or<00:03:09.310> an<00:03:09.489> exfoliator<00:03:10.150> to

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
like use a loofah or an exfoliator to

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:12.600 
like use a loofah or an exfoliator to
get<00:03:10.690> it<00:03:10.810> off<00:03:10.989> and<00:03:11.319> like<00:03:11.829> I<00:03:11.950> said<00:03:12.010> mine<00:03:12.459> are

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:12.610 
get it off and like I said mine are

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:14.580 
get it off and like I said mine are
still<00:03:12.910> a<00:03:12.940> little<00:03:13.269> orgy<00:03:13.599> even<00:03:14.290> after

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
still a little orgy even after

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:17.879 
still a little orgy even after
exfoliating<00:03:15.160> so<00:03:16.140> that's<00:03:17.140> the<00:03:17.319> downside<00:03:17.500> so

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:17.889 
exfoliating so that's the downside so

00:03:17.889 --> 00:03:18.960 
exfoliating so that's the downside so
you<00:03:17.980> might<00:03:18.100> want<00:03:18.280> to<00:03:18.310> wear<00:03:18.459> gloves<00:03:18.670> or

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970 
you might want to wear gloves or

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:20.629 
you might want to wear gloves or
whatever<00:03:19.269> but<00:03:19.480> I<00:03:19.540> don't<00:03:19.630> really<00:03:19.989> have<00:03:20.139> any

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:20.639 
whatever but I don't really have any

00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:25.890 
whatever but I don't really have any
gloves<00:03:21.639> right<00:03:22.120> now<00:03:22.620> so<00:03:23.620> like<00:03:24.400> I<00:03:24.430> said<00:03:24.880> I<00:03:25.269> really

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
gloves right now so like I said I really

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:29.220 
gloves right now so like I said I really
do<00:03:26.290> like<00:03:26.620> the<00:03:26.889> color<00:03:27.160> so<00:03:27.970> I<00:03:28.000> guess<00:03:28.420> out<00:03:28.690> of<00:03:28.810> a<00:03:28.930> 5

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:29.230 
do like the color so I guess out of a 5

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:31.099 
do like the color so I guess out of a 5
I<00:03:29.620> would<00:03:29.709> give<00:03:30.010> it<00:03:30.130> a<00:03:30.220> three-and-a-half<00:03:30.850> stars

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:31.109 
I would give it a three-and-a-half stars

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:33.900 
I would give it a three-and-a-half stars
just<00:03:32.109> because<00:03:32.530> it<00:03:32.769> does<00:03:32.980> laughs<00:03:33.340> and<00:03:33.639> it<00:03:33.730> does

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:33.910 
just because it does laughs and it does

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:37.530 
just because it does laughs and it does
give<00:03:34.150> good<00:03:34.420> color<00:03:35.010> okay<00:03:36.010> so<00:03:36.489> the<00:03:36.910> next<00:03:37.150> two

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:37.540 
give good color okay so the next two

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.240 
give good color okay so the next two
things<00:03:37.930> that<00:03:38.200> I<00:03:38.230> picked<00:03:38.470> up<00:03:38.680> when<00:03:38.859> I<00:03:38.980> was<00:03:39.100> at
