00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.780

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.310
 subscribers 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.100
 if I never believed that one 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:23.840
 funny kauz how I like that 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:28.170

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:33.090
 thank you to the team 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:37.440
 skate normally I was because of that 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:41.600
 completely new wise no pro videos and yes 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:44.250
 the hungarian kitchen is very fierce and 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.910
 but I have a dish in the 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.320
 found 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.050
 of course I have something 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:52.230
 slimmed it down for mine 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.149
 needs and you want to 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.180
 introduce yourself and a paprika 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:59.850
 media and if you are interested in how 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:03.300
 it is really super delicious 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:06.270
 dish with a great sauce then 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:10.200
 Just keep watching and I will 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:13.799
 would say as usual because the ingredients 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:16.619
 we need a chicken 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.310
 about 1500 grams of fresh bits 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.740
 see 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.310
 I do not do what hofkirchen because I 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.389
 these chickens from this 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:28.439
 Massentierhaltung simply not more 

00:01:24.389 --> 00:01:30.810
 can buy and I prefer to buy a high school diploma 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:33.590
 1 is going a bit more but you 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:36.659
 buy what you are sympathetic and 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:40.409
 we still have paprika here I have 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:43.170
 white like paprika three pieces something 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.789
 garlic can also be a red onion 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.509
 normally take a white onion 

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:50.459
 no problem 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:53.099
 and here paprika roses some salt 

00:01:50.459 --> 00:01:57.270
 We take olive oil and butter 

00:01:53.099 --> 00:02:01.380
 fry cream and saute one at a time 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:04.469
 the vatican mug ridiculous was now 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.069
 the onions go small and then 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:07.109
 it continues 

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:09.330
 here are our small cut ingredients 

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:11.490
 Here I have the peppers in such 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:14.400
 pieces cut 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:17.670
 and the onions and the garlic and 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:19.980
 the sooner a roast in the 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:31.200
 applied case ever something olive oil 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:36.000
 pure and a piece of butter dissolved the 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:37.950
 sound recording at low level of 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.080
 west the peppers and onions 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.490
 slowly his arts 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.950
 we do not have any color at all 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:47.040
 get and now we find it in the 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:50.610
 we have to take care of it 15 times 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:53.130
 cut their teeth like that 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:57.690
 washed or rinsed with cold 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:03:00.540
 water and dried up i have here 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:01.020
 another dish now by the parts 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.960
 purely 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:05.510
 which I now separate here to learn 

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:07.860
 with the wings 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:14.160
 we just have to link names 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:18.600
 Just look through now 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:20.820
 I must admit, I'm here too 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:23.220
 not the big specialist and the goal 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:24.380
 simply in the cellar is the next 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:26.730
 wing 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:29.040
 I hope you see it here too 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:30.690
 just look after the joint then 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:33.360
 This can be done well 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:36.660
 and then only a knife is fast 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:39.320
 no bones and no bone 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:39.320
 sever 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:45.960
 burning off the thighs 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:48.930
 we will move exactly the same 

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:51.930
 The leg to the side so that you the joint 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:54.810
 uncover and exactly at the memorial 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:57.650
 let's cut it off with the knife 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:04:00.870
 should actually be relatively easy 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:03.870
 Now we still have the chest from the rest 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:07.560
 race and we cut to use 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:11.340
 the ribs along that should be relative 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:13.800
 be easy and push the spine 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:16.709
 we simply rent it behind it with it 

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:20.580
 better missed in the and now 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:25.790
 formulated the breast that we had 

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:25.790
 the waste away here as honey 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:35.720
 the chicken advises your cut and 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:38.780
 The breast is naturally attached to bones 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:40.810
 Gone a lot of time to choose this job 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:43.280
 Of course, not just too exhausting 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:46.729
 it should be uncomfortable 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:50.120
 Buy chicken pieces and a breast 

00:04:46.729 --> 00:04:52.520
 then it's just as good as the vegetables are 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:05:01.490
 Sun comes in the meantime from now 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:05:05.330
 the garlic with with and after 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:07.280
 the minute paprika comes with it briefly 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:10.849
 rather take care 

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:17.539
 It will be fit very fast and now 

00:05:10.849 --> 00:05:18.889
 immediately the similar parts rank that 

00:05:17.539 --> 00:05:21.110
 flag is now at medium 

00:05:18.889 --> 00:05:23.090
 temperature for one minute in the pan 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:25.819
 and panned her and not really 

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:26.210
 seared so the minute it is now 

00:05:25.819 --> 00:05:29.000
 past 

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:32.139
 Now we have to do water immediately 

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:34.639
 otherwise the paprika 

00:05:32.139 --> 00:05:37.430
 Now we can chop with one 

00:05:34.639 --> 00:05:40.310
 Cover and leave that up 

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:44.650
 faint heat simmer in front of him 

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:46.449
 after 30 to 40 minutes should the chicken 

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:49.190
 be finished 

00:05:46.449 --> 00:05:52.159
 which hurt a good half hour 

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:54.080
 they bleed these awesome hours 

00:05:52.159 --> 00:05:59.860
 a good three quarters of an hour, though 

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:59.860
 now through the chicken parts out 

00:06:06.639 --> 00:06:15.210
 now comes the cup cream and 

00:06:11.499 --> 00:06:15.210
 the mug schmandt 

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:19.270
 Seeing here is natural 

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:23.050
 the sauce so no sauces 

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:25.960
 so that the whole thing is now sauce 

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:29.140
 let's do it with a wandmixer 

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:32.800
 Mixing is important to dive well otherwise 

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:38.790
 it injects everywhere by mixing 

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:38.790
 shun the sauce then also lovely on 

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:46.290
 So let's boil it up for a moment 

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:48.640
 so stay tuned and you have to go out immediately 

00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:54.120
 I can not get salt in yet 

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:56.680
 That's why you could pay depending on the taste 

00:06:54.120 --> 00:07:00.640
 so now the chicken comes in again 

00:06:56.680 --> 00:07:02.770
 for 23 minutes as I said 

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:05.730
 now shut off that's just now 

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:05.730
 still advertise the right 

00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:18.940
 this is how our finished dish looks like here 

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:20.680
 as a side dish you can also like 

00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:23.410
 to do something else 

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:27.160
 I would say the sauce is like that 

00:07:23.410 --> 00:07:29.640
 put in delicious and I wish it now 

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:33.810
 Good luck cooking and cooking 

00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:33.810
 of course good appetite
