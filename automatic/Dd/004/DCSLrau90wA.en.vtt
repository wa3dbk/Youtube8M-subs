some<00:01:37.020> gameplay<00:01:37.470> that<00:01:37.619> he<00:01:37.770> did<00:01:38.009> do<00:01:38.250> with<00:01:38.430> these

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:38.780 
some gameplay that he did do with these

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.889 
some gameplay that he did do with these
supposed<00:01:39.780> Ruby<00:01:40.530> Yao<00:01:41.400> Ming<00:01:41.729> so<00:01:42.240> you<00:01:42.299> can<00:01:42.750> see
