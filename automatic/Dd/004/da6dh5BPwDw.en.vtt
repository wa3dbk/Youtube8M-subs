00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:08.899
 next we will see the 

00:00:08.899 --> 00:00:11.519
 after the production of may rubber his face 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.779
 from that first stage the psoe the threshed area consisting of an engine 

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:18.009
 what 

00:00:18.009 --> 00:00:20.869
 in which his family dies without end 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:24.649
 dies the corn and leaves it ready for communes of a bÃ©tica project 

00:00:25.749 --> 00:00:28.949
 subsequently the area has ventilated we must control the humidity of zambia 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.189
 a stopped to maintain it optimal conditions and that is ready for 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.570
 cooking that is our next stage 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:36.480
 possibly in cooking 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.020
 according to zetsche 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:39.420
 well forward 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.220
 two and a half hours between those specials 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:45.220
 and later to this commission we see in the mine 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:50.060
 of the minority to be the two best in the league a flat 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.350
 which by a conveyor belt we drive it still 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:55.920
 until an oven that is 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.360
 that is encouraged with a gas pipe which consists of a flute that 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:02.660
 later we will see 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:04.870
 Once the flakes are passed through the baking 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:07.800
 centers craves in the camera and flavored 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:11.290
 which straight to a sugar solution at 180 degrees Celsius 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.090
 once Dutch of laziness orizaba 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:18.790
 sixth per ton mind wage band agreed 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:21.790
 where we finally have 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.740
 Spanish moral larsson to dispatch 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:29.890
 now we will possibly see the animation 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.950
 we added add a new ace 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:44.470
 We are the unstoppable and marine 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:49.730
 what asks us to enter wrong first value that is 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:50.980
 the amount 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:53.020
 we are entering the m 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.270
 the area ventilated kesha cubic meters there are no three to five 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.740
 cubic meters how we can be valid the luso turn on screw 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.400
 without end of the month 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.450
 trite and we see how the anti-eleven bed 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.189
 it begins to fill 

00:02:09.189 --> 00:02:12.189
 we close a moment that if they have 

00:02:13.079 --> 00:02:15.119
 now if the light comes on 

00:02:15.119 --> 00:02:16.029
 our country 

00:02:16.029 --> 00:02:17.489
 the fan 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:20.909
 as much in value that will move to one side 

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:23.909
 in which indicates the order of 

00:02:24.759 --> 00:02:27.719
 it was a final that links 

00:02:27.719 --> 00:02:30.489
 optimum level 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:34.310
 an exit of the last one is maintained before a time and it begins to approach and we have 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:36.709
 the process flow so the cooking area 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:38.919
 and our part begins 

00:02:38.919 --> 00:02:41.919
 cooking 

00:02:49.669 --> 00:02:51.109
 he did it once 

00:02:51.109 --> 00:02:54.169
 ends the denver part of being ventilated 

00:02:54.169 --> 00:02:57.119
 and I finished the cooking part 

00:02:57.119 --> 00:02:59.749
 of possibly in 106 

00:02:59.749 --> 00:03:02.519
 the temperature is requested the 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:05.519
 of the more than 700 integrated centigrade by default 

00:03:07.749 --> 00:03:09.219
 we see how the lead 

00:03:09.219 --> 00:03:10.829
 company 

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:12.829
 on the other hand from the mine 

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:16.889
 which will possibly fall to the transporting belt and barcelona os 

00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:19.959
 we see to me as the as he the furnace employs heated erte 

00:03:20.809 --> 00:03:22.649
 brussels the flute 

00:03:22.649 --> 00:03:24.199
 already 

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:25.190
 is activated 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:27.309
 one of the heated table 

00:03:27.309 --> 00:03:30.729
 are exempt from use we see how the places pass 

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:34.119
 of material and we have as they go from one place to another and the color of 

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:36.459
 tÃ©lam bendezÃº 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:40.149
 of a more yellow color one more used that is what we want 

00:03:40.149 --> 00:03:43.029
 and the network is also turned on, even though it is where the 

00:03:43.029 --> 00:03:46.029
 solution to your face 

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:53.549
 we wait for the land a bit I will go as you pass the 

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:54.789
 quantity 

00:03:54.789 --> 00:03:56.160
 d material 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.799
 if we continue as 

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:01.909
 pack 1 1 m 

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:04.909
 the system 

00:04:05.469 --> 00:04:05.939
 Their ages
