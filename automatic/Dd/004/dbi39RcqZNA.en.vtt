00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:05.710
 once again here with you stable 

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:08.200
 Miguel Ángel Rocha on this occasion 

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:10.840
 I bring a little sport is the 

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:13.780
 file manager elche 2 

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:15.880
 for our the 19 the only requirement to 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:17.890
 have to be able to install it is to be in 

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:19.510
 gelves since nice cream sanwich no 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:21.630
 works 

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:24.400
 the truth this file manager 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.710
 It brings many improvements on which 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:29.080
 it comes from the factory because as you 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:31.090
 they will know then the one that has of factory only 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:33.970
 brings the option to access memory 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:36.180
 external to the internal memory and the 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:38.580
 files that we have online 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.830
 unlike this the administrator of 

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:43.500
 files that I'm going to show you 

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:44.870
 install the one of liquids in our the 9 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.280
 bring option to manage 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:50.730
 independently the files as of 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:53.190
 music videos photographs or others 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:56.309
 files in addition as the options 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.960
 typical of online files and access 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.239
 to memories and an option from those 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.520
 I liked the fact that we can use it 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.860
 in the background is to say how 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.450
 q is light applications on 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.250
 other images but that we're going to 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.259
 see later already not to do so 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.520
 long the first thing they have to do is 

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:13.920
 download to the next application 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.750
 as always there is a description is left 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.940
 the download link this application the 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:21.780
 ifai manager then they have to do 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:24.270
 is to select the one that appears 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.940
 will replace the application click on 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.910
 ok and they give him install as soon as they give him 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:31.280
 install the application will close as 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:33.890
 can see 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.570
 they will wait until it turns gray 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:37.850
 I know if they caught up to see first I was 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:39.619
 black the box and now it went gray 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:41.330
 good is that it has gone gray already 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:43.700
 we can access again to 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:45.350
 file manager and how will they look 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:49.190
 we already have the file manager 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:51.350
 of angy 2 in our he has 9 the 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:53.720
 they really come very full very much 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:55.520
 better to the one that comes from the factory as 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:58.750
 you can see we are divided the 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:01.220
 files in songs images videos 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:04.340
 documents and of course access 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:06.170
 general to the files as you can see 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.630
 it still divides us what is the 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:11.150
 internal storage with the 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:12.350
 external storage what I like 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.150
 of this application is that it has the 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:16.220
 option to use it in the background as 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.750
 The applications of the coes light is very 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.569
 easy to do the only thing that we have to 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:23.530
 to do is to click on the box and as 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:26.300
 can see is put in the background 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:30.760
 like the applications of the cv slide 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:33.710
 we can equally resized 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:36.020
 how to see the transparency 

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:37.730
 without given case you will not like them and 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:39.410
 I would like to understand again the 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:41.960
 old administrator the one that comes from 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:45.320
 factory then they have to go to their 

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:48.100
 applications proceed to uninstall the 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:48.100
 administrator 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:54.830
 once they have uninstalled it they will 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:56.840
 find the application that comes installed 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:59.270
 to make our 19 on the 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:01.580
 application administrator the 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:03.920
 they select and they will install the 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:07.360
 file manager application 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.360
 They give install 

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:12.010
 once it has been installed we will have 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:16.000
 again the file manager 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:18.010
 which comes from the factory with our enyele 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.900
 Well, that would be everything but there 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:21.900
 liked and see you next
