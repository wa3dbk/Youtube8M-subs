passcode<00:01:16.259> and<00:01:18.950> make<00:01:19.950> sure<00:01:20.159> this<00:01:20.369> is<00:01:20.549> enabled

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
passcode and make sure this is enabled

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.810 
passcode and make sure this is enabled
and<00:01:21.330> you<00:01:21.659> can<00:01:21.810> also<00:01:22.500> disable<00:01:23.310> your<00:01:23.610> true

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
and you can also disable your true

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.450 
and you can also disable your true
passcode<00:01:24.390> so<00:01:24.659> only<00:01:25.229> time<00:01:25.590> passcode<00:01:26.070> works<00:01:26.250> and

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
passcode so only time passcode works and

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.819 
passcode so only time passcode works and
not<00:01:26.580> your<00:01:26.820> official<00:01:27.420> passcode<00:01:27.930> so<00:01:28.409> as<00:01:28.590> you<00:01:28.710> can

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
not your official passcode so as you can

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.530 
not your official passcode so as you can

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
time is 5 14 which means after enter
