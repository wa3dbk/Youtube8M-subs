00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.140 
loaded up online for the first time my
characters<00:00:17.100> seemed<00:00:17.609> to<00:00:17.730> have<00:00:17.850> all<00:00:17.970> these

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
characters seemed to have all these

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.790 
characters seemed to have all these
stripes<00:00:18.630> across<00:00:19.730> you<00:00:20.730> know<00:00:20.880> the<00:00:20.910> shell<00:00:21.800> the

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
stripes across you know the shell the

stripes across you know the shell the
clothing<00:00:23.310> the<00:00:23.580> face<00:00:23.820> everything<00:00:24.920> so<00:00:25.920> I<00:00:25.949> looked

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
clothing the face everything so I looked

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.040 
clothing the face everything so I looked
online<00:00:26.430> I<00:00:26.640> couldn't<00:00:27.119> really<00:00:27.210> find<00:00:27.539> much<00:00:27.840> it

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
online I couldn't really find much it

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.529 
online I couldn't really find much it
was<00:00:28.170> quite<00:00:28.349> difficult<00:00:28.560> to<00:00:28.890> search<00:00:29.130> for<00:00:29.539> GTA

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
was quite difficult to search for GTA

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.450 
was quite difficult to search for GTA
character<00:00:31.080> with<00:00:31.380> stripes<00:00:31.800> nothing<00:00:32.250> really

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
character with stripes nothing really

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.760 
character with stripes nothing really
came<00:00:32.640> up<00:00:32.850> so<00:00:33.690> look<00:00:33.930> if<00:00:33.989> I<00:00:34.140> just<00:00:34.320> show<00:00:34.469> you<00:00:34.530> here

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
came up so look if I just show you here

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.490 
came up so look if I just show you here
and<00:00:34.980> I<00:00:35.070> randomized<00:00:36.000> through<00:00:36.750> the<00:00:36.930> characters

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
and I randomized through the characters

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.830 
and I randomized through the characters
you<00:00:38.250> can<00:00:38.430> see<00:00:38.670> that<00:00:39.059> every<00:00:39.450> single<00:00:39.480> character

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
you can see that every single character

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.569 
you can see that every single character
has<00:00:40.140> stripes<00:00:40.469> on<00:00:40.739> like<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:41.040> shell<00:00:41.309> of<00:00:41.460> the

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
has stripes on like the shell of the

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.569 
has stripes on like the shell of the
character<00:00:42.000> and<00:00:42.210> sort<00:00:43.170> of<00:00:43.230> the<00:00:43.440> trousers<00:00:44.160> the

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
character and sort of the trousers the

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.760 
character and sort of the trousers the
tops<00:00:44.850> it's<00:00:45.510> really<00:00:45.899> weird<00:00:46.140> it<00:00:46.320> doesn't<00:00:46.440> not

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
some t-shirts so I realized that there

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.439 
some t-shirts so I realized that there
was<00:00:49.440> an<00:00:49.530> error<00:00:49.649> occurring<00:00:50.039> and<00:00:50.370> what<00:00:51.210> you<00:00:51.329> need

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:19.189 
know graphics cards to work correctly

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:21.800 
know graphics cards to work correctly
then<00:01:20.189> you<00:01:20.430> need<00:01:20.580> to<00:01:20.790> make<00:01:21.540> sure<00:01:21.659> that's

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
then you need to make sure that's

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.749 
then you need to make sure that's
installed<00:01:22.320> properly<00:01:22.590> then<00:01:23.220> you<00:01:23.340> need<00:01:23.460> to<00:01:23.549> turn

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759

shell<00:01:33.869> of<00:01:34.140> the<00:01:34.320> actual<00:01:34.590> character<00:01:35.329> okay<00:01:36.329> so

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
shell of the actual character okay so

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.749 
shell of the actual character okay so
for<00:01:36.810> nvidia<00:01:37.350> and<00:01:37.500> AMD<00:01:37.619> users<00:01:38.220> this<00:01:38.400> is<00:01:38.460> only

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
for nvidia and AMD users this is only

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.640 
for nvidia and AMD users this is only
going<00:01:39.030> to<00:01:39.180> be<00:01:39.270> a<00:01:39.299> problem<00:01:39.570> if<00:01:39.990> you<00:01:40.259> don't

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
going to be a problem if you don't

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.370 
going to be a problem if you don't
update<00:01:40.890> your<00:01:41.250> drivers<00:01:41.909> at<00:01:42.509> the<00:01:42.720> start<00:01:43.049> of<00:01:43.229> the

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
update your drivers at the start of the

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.410 
update your drivers at the start of the
launch<00:01:43.560> so<00:01:44.280> this<00:01:44.430> is<00:01:44.549> kind<00:01:44.790> of<00:01:44.850> relevant<00:01:45.119> now

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
launch so this is kind of relevant now

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:46.999 
launch so this is kind of relevant now
but<00:01:45.659> it's<00:01:45.810> not<00:01:45.869> going<00:01:46.049> to<00:01:46.110> be<00:01:46.229> relevant<00:01:46.500> in<00:01:46.829> the

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
but it's not going to be relevant in the

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.889 
but it's not going to be relevant in the
future<00:01:47.090> because<00:01:48.090> I<00:01:48.210> imagine<00:01:48.600> that<00:01:48.750> other

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
future because I imagine that other

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.240 
future because I imagine that other
games<00:01:49.200> will<00:01:49.380> come<00:01:49.530> out<00:01:49.680> and<00:01:49.860> you'll<00:01:50.009> just

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
games will come out and you'll just

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.539 
games will come out and you'll just
naturally<00:01:50.790> update<00:01:51.090> your<00:01:51.329> drivers<00:01:52.340> so<00:01:53.340> yeah

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
naturally update your drivers so yeah

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.550 
naturally update your drivers so yeah
then<00:01:54.240> you<00:01:54.390> can<00:01:54.509> create<00:01:54.689> your<00:01:54.780> character<00:01:55.290> as

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
then you can create your character as

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.109 
then you can create your character as
