hey guys these I are below breaker and

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:05.030 
hey guys these I are below breaker and
today<00:00:03.540> I'm<00:00:03.780> going<00:00:03.840> to<00:00:04.080> teach<00:00:04.290> you<00:00:04.470> how<00:00:04.500> to<00:00:04.710> get

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:05.040 
today I'm going to teach you how to get

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.240 
today I'm going to teach you how to get
cydia<00:00:05.370> on<00:00:05.549> iOS<00:00:06.359> 8<00:00:06.569> without<00:00:07.410> actual<00:00:08.069> you're

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250 
cydia on iOS 8 without actual you're

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:09.589 
cydia on iOS 8 without actual you're
breaking<00:00:08.610> as<00:00:08.730> you<00:00:08.849> know<00:00:08.970> it's<00:00:09.210> almost

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
breaking as you know it's almost

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:12.169 
breaking as you know it's almost
impossible<00:00:09.900> to<00:00:10.530> actually<00:00:10.830> get<00:00:11.340> cydia<00:00:11.610> it's

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
impossible to actually get cydia it's

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:13.459 
impossible to actually get cydia it's
because<00:00:12.570> the<00:00:12.660> versions<00:00:13.019> have<00:00:13.200> to<00:00:13.349> be

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
because the versions have to be

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.880 
because the versions have to be
exploited<00:00:14.309> and<00:00:14.519> it<00:00:14.790> takes<00:00:15.000> a<00:00:15.120> long<00:00:15.299> time<00:00:15.360> and

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:15.890 
exploited and it takes a long time and

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:18.650 
exploited and it takes a long time and
that's<00:00:16.890> why<00:00:17.130> i<00:00:17.160> say<00:00:17.820> jailbreak<00:00:18.180> is<00:00:18.300> not<00:00:18.480> out

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
that's why i say jailbreak is not out

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.980 
that's why i say jailbreak is not out
yet<00:00:18.690> and<00:00:19.080> the<00:00:19.650> jailbreak<00:00:20.310> team<00:00:20.730> is<00:00:21.600> actually

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
yet and the jailbreak team is actually

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.550 
yet and the jailbreak team is actually
trying<00:00:22.199> to<00:00:22.350> do<00:00:22.470> that<00:00:22.650> right<00:00:22.710> now<00:00:22.920> but<00:00:23.760> anyway

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:24.560 
trying to do that right now but anyway

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.250 
trying to do that right now but anyway
you<00:00:25.560> can<00:00:25.710> just<00:00:25.949> basically<00:00:26.550> do<00:00:27.449> what<00:00:27.869> I'd<00:00:27.990> say

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
you can just basically do what I'd say

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.890 
you can just basically do what I'd say
to<00:00:28.320> actually<00:00:28.980> kind<00:00:29.550> of<00:00:29.699> get<00:00:29.910> the<00:00:30.060> CD<00:00:30.269> icon<00:00:30.510> and

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
to actually kind of get the CD icon and

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.380 
to actually kind of get the CD icon and
kind<00:00:31.140> of<00:00:31.230> make<00:00:31.470> it<00:00:31.500> look<00:00:31.859> like<00:00:32.040> cydia<00:00:32.369> so<00:00:33.239> all

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
kind of make it look like cydia so all

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.940 
kind of make it look like cydia so all
you<00:00:33.480> have<00:00:33.540> to<00:00:33.660> do<00:00:33.809> is<00:00:34.020> go<00:00:34.200> into<00:00:34.320> bi<00:00:34.620> t<00:00:35.059> ly<00:00:36.559> /<00:00:37.559> and
