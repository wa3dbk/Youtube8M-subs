00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.850
 good 

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:17.590
 10 things to do in antiquity 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:19.630
 will see us in first person good here 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:21.880
 we are in the old gta in this 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:23.560
 old secret and everything looks very old 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.640
 because it's the old gta but I think that 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:27.820
 this secret is best seen at first 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:30.250
 person written down not in this gta no 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:32.000
 there is no first person because it is very very 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:36.080
 old 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:39.790
 in the future hello butcher friends or what 

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:39.790
 I want them to come from the future 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:48.370
 tour 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:56.660
 this technique is called hitting someone 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:58.550
 of the 'no no no no wait is called hit 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.480
 to someone of antiquity for that such 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:03.440
 this technique 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:04.670
 ok see, for sure, yes sure 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.850
 you can not jump around here 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:10.860
 who knew 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:10.860
 this technique the apprentice in the future 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:16.240
 need the bathrooms ok as everything is very 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:20.200
 the only thing that occurred to me was 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:22.720
 visit the old gta bath of the 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.580
 360 of playstation 3 is a bathroom very 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:27.369
 old as they see very very rustic made 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:29.740
 of wood to I guess that in these rates 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:32.080
 of the bathroom there is no water yet they are simply 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:35.590
 so dry baths that you have to throw 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:37.960
 sand for then to go then the 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:39.750
 poop chairs and debris this is how 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:42.930
 works base 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:45.780
 have bad connection ok we are walking 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:49.470
 here in ancient lands watching as the 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:52.800
 gt acb and before you suddenly work 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.330
 flatly alert to the connection 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:56.729
 it's garbage and the gta had to 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:58.380
 disconnect because it is very old and 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:01.470
 that message only comes to you in the 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.450
 antique look for fauna and we generate 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:05.280
 quickly on motorcycles looking 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.050
 fauna but how do I remember that this 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.080
 game is very old here still had not 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:12.780
 as much wildlife as in the new generation 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:15.120
 it is simply a landscape a landscape 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.040
 full of no there is no grass either 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.900
 there is grass because as it is old then 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.620
 they did not schedule the grass either, so 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:24.870
 we are going to fly and in the past we want 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:26.640
 escape from the old police to the side 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.220
 policemen I come from the future so 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.570
 you have no power over me 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.450
 if they think that they will be able to catch me with 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:35.280
 those antiques with those trinkets of 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.110
 patrols that have their tires punctured 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.580
 of a bullet if you buy in rims 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:40.230
 future those will not be useful for 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.330
 nothing 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.870
 it's a long process but finally 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:47.560
 I managed to escape 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:48.879
 green old people we are here 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.640
 lost in the middle of nowhere so 

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:54.599
 let's open the map to find a 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.599
 new location 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:03:02.500
 the map is green this thing is green 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:04.750
 green ok is sometimes a very famous phrase 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:07.450
 well now let's talk to the mechanic 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:09.190
 so this is going to fly to cars 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:10.510
 old or that we are in this 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:12.129
 old gas station while I put 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:14.230
 ancient dynamite in the middle of these two 

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:16.720
 old cars so anciently 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:18.940
 we see the old chile mountain while I 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:21.120
 he walked me away down this road 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:23.799
 old and reaching towards that sign 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:25.480
 old while we see cars passing by 

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:28.680
 that old road so I turn around and 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.680
 we make an explosion 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:35.379
 While there is certainly the edges 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:36.610
 hello backpackers hello how are you like 

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:39.480
 my friends are knots 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:42.489
 Backpackers, well, better said 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:45.370
 backpacker good as I come from 

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:47.670
 future hear you take it to the future and 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:49.780
 I come to give you advice in the future 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:52.260
 no, they will not stop listening to my 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:54.909
 advice of the future no no 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:56.120
 Well, I'm just going to say that you do not 

00:03:54.909 --> 00:03:58.959
 he 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.959
 they are going to die 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.540
 for sure this part of the city I already 

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:09.190
 hates so I do not care because we're going 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:11.050
 to take out this old pyrotechnics cannon 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:13.300
 I have installed a lot of that 4 in 

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:15.580
 those cars so in a few moments everything 

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:17.859
 fly in a thousand pieces but we do not shoot 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:21.180
 the pyrotechnic truck to create a 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:24.520
 huge chaos let loose grenades 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:25.780
 it exploded and it was close it fell very close to 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:27.340
 me that grenade we keep orienting 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:30.370
 grenades that explode to create the 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:32.500
 absolute chaos and that all the people leave 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:37.020
 flying and burn everything and everyone 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:37.020
 woman herself 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:41.050
 I bet they had not seen the man 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:41.050
 Burned
