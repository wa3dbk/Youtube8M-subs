last<00:00:11.070> time<00:00:11.400> I<00:00:11.670> mentioned<00:00:12.360> that<00:00:12.420> there<00:00:12.599> were

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
last time I mentioned that there were

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.480 
last time I mentioned that there were
two<00:00:12.959> Disney<00:00:13.260> films<00:00:13.769> that<00:00:13.920> I<00:00:13.980> would<00:00:14.190> always

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
two Disney films that I would always

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.700 
two Disney films that I would always
watch<00:00:14.969> as<00:00:15.150> a<00:00:15.180> kid<00:00:15.510> with<00:00:15.959> one<00:00:16.230> of<00:00:16.350> them<00:00:16.470> being

watch as a kid with one of them being
Alice<00:00:17.160> in<00:00:17.310> Wonderland<00:00:17.700> the<00:00:18.630> other<00:00:18.779> is<00:00:19.259> another

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:19.950 
Alice in Wonderland the other is another

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:22.400 
Alice in Wonderland the other is another
different<00:00:20.550> movie<00:00:20.880> but<00:00:21.660> believe<00:00:22.080> it<00:00:22.200> or<00:00:22.259> not

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
different movie but believe it or not

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.429 
different movie but believe it or not
this<00:00:23.130> one<00:00:23.430> is<00:00:23.580> even<00:00:23.790> weirder<00:00:24.360> than<00:00:24.570> Alice<00:00:25.260> in

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
this one is even weirder than Alice in

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.590 
this one is even weirder than Alice in
Wonderland<00:00:25.890> both<00:00:26.640> because<00:00:27.090> of<00:00:27.119> the<00:00:27.300> movie

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:27.600 
Wonderland both because of the movie

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.570 
Wonderland both because of the movie
itself<00:00:27.990> and<00:00:28.260> the<00:00:28.710> choice<00:00:28.980> for<00:00:29.279> one<00:00:29.430> of<00:00:29.550> my

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
itself and the choice for one of my

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.939 
itself and the choice for one of my
favorites<00:00:30.180> since<00:00:30.840> this<00:00:31.080> is<00:00:31.289> actually<00:00:31.800> a

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
favorites since this is actually a

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.479 
favorites since this is actually a
packaged<00:00:32.669> film<00:00:33.000> of<00:00:33.210> the<00:00:33.449> 40s<00:00:33.930> for<00:00:34.800> number<00:00:35.160> 6

thing<00:00:40.199> with<00:00:40.350> packaged<00:00:40.769> films<00:00:41.100> is<00:00:41.250> that

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
thing with packaged films is that

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.459 
thing with packaged films is that
they're<00:00:41.640> literally<00:00:42.000> short<00:00:42.540> cartoons<00:00:43.079> slapped

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
together to make something that's

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.389 
together to make something that's
feature-length<00:00:45.559> sometimes<00:00:46.559> like<00:00:46.860> make<00:00:47.160> my

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
Disney can take one segment and present

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.869 
Disney can take one segment and present
it<00:00:54.660> as<00:00:54.809> its<00:00:55.020> own<00:00:55.140> short<00:00:55.590> but<00:00:56.430> with<00:00:56.579> Three

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
really gets into what he got rather it

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.020 
really gets into what he got rather it
be<00:01:06.990> by<00:01:07.170> watching<00:01:07.440> some<00:01:07.830> films<00:01:08.220> or<00:01:08.520> quite

00:01:18.589 --> 00:01:18.599 
own but with everything else it feels

00:01:18.599 --> 00:01:21.320 
own but with everything else it feels
like<00:01:18.929> they<00:01:19.110> all<00:01:19.289> connect<00:01:19.890> together<00:01:20.330> instead

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
like they all connect together instead

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.240 
like they all connect together instead
of<00:01:21.390> just<00:01:21.720> several<00:01:22.020> animated<00:01:22.440> shorts<00:01:22.860> at<00:01:22.979> once

everything feels like one big Donald
Duck<00:01:26.130> cartoon<00:01:26.640> now<00:01:27.539> I<00:01:27.569> will<00:01:28.020> agree<00:01:28.349> that<00:01:28.619> the

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
Duck cartoon now I will agree that the

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.520 
Duck cartoon now I will agree that the
story<00:01:29.130> itself<00:01:29.580> can<00:01:29.940> be<00:01:30.119> inconsistent<00:01:30.990> in<00:01:31.140> fact

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
story itself can be inconsistent in fact

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.070 
story itself can be inconsistent in fact
it<00:01:31.770> can<00:01:31.920> be<00:01:32.069> all<00:01:32.280> over<00:01:32.580> the<00:01:32.700> place<00:01:32.940> at<00:01:33.179> first<00:01:33.840> it

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:34.080 
it can be all over the place at first it

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:35.600 
it can be all over the place at first it
wants<00:01:34.289> to<00:01:34.349> be<00:01:34.470> a<00:01:34.500> packaged<00:01:34.890> film<00:01:35.190> then<00:01:35.490> it

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
wants to be a packaged film then it

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.430 
wants to be a packaged film then it
becomes<00:01:35.940> educational<00:01:36.720> than<00:01:36.990> a<00:01:37.050> Donald<00:01:37.410> Duck

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:37.440 
becomes educational than a Donald Duck

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:39.800 
becomes educational than a Donald Duck
cartoon<00:01:37.590> and<00:01:38.280> then<00:01:38.640> it<00:01:38.819> ends<00:01:39.119> off<00:01:39.270> by<00:01:39.509> doing

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
cartoon and then it ends off by doing

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.630 
cartoon and then it ends off by doing
whatever<00:01:40.020> it<00:01:40.319> wants<00:01:40.649> like<00:01:40.830> he<00:01:40.950> gave<00:01:41.190> up<00:01:41.489> and

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
whatever it wants like he gave up and

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.210 
whatever it wants like he gave up and
went<00:01:41.849> all<00:01:41.970> pink<00:01:42.270> elephants<00:01:42.750> on<00:01:42.840> us<00:01:43.080> that<00:01:44.009> is

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
went all pink elephants on us that is

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.609 
went all pink elephants on us that is
true<00:01:44.700> but<00:01:45.360> that's<00:01:45.599> not<00:01:45.869> why<00:01:46.080> I<00:01:46.110> love<00:01:46.470> this

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
true but that's not why I love this

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.370 
true but that's not why I love this
movie<00:01:46.950> so<00:01:46.979> much<00:01:47.399> like<00:01:48.239> Alice<00:01:48.660> in<00:01:48.780> Wonderland

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
what really makes it for me is the

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.169 
what really makes it for me is the
characters<00:01:51.840> and<00:01:52.160> animation<00:01:53.160> with<00:01:53.849> all<00:01:54.030> the

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
characters they bring out a unique

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.370 
characters they bring out a unique
personality<00:01:56.819> and<00:01:56.849> likability<00:01:57.599> to<00:01:57.989> the<00:01:58.110> film

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380

eccentric patitos and the unexpected
zaniness<00:02:04.170> of

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.820 

but<00:02:16.450> I<00:02:16.480> think<00:02:16.840> the<00:02:16.990> most<00:02:17.200> intriguing

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
but I think the most intriguing

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:20.250 
but I think the most intriguing
character<00:02:17.860> out<00:02:18.490> of<00:02:18.520> all<00:02:18.910> of<00:02:19.090> this<00:02:19.270> is<00:02:19.570> actually

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
character out of all of this is actually

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.770 
character out of all of this is actually
Donald<00:02:20.800> since<00:02:21.370> he's<00:02:21.610> actually<00:02:21.790> not<00:02:22.420> the

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
Donald since he's actually not the

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:24.840 
Donald since he's actually not the
hot-tempered<00:02:23.290> duck<00:02:23.770> we<00:02:24.010> all<00:02:24.160> remember<00:02:24.640> him

hot-tempered duck we all remember him
for<00:02:25.170> here<00:02:26.170> Donal<00:02:26.980> is<00:02:27.130> more<00:02:27.459> like<00:02:27.670> goofy<00:02:28.270> trying

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870
