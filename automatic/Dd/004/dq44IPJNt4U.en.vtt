00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:13.219
 well greet all and so stirs up a 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:16.580
 new little video to open his 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:18.400
 mat on the game call of duty - fair 2 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:21.020
 where the other call of duty simple long 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:24.200
 so sure that it is against 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:24.820
 members and rome the mat so for them 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:29.120
 steam games 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:30.140
 so that's going to be simple and well 

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:35.170
 have to go to the page of 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:38.120
 configuration of his router so the one 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:41.210
 of orange its 192 for now these are 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:45.680
 8 points 1 point for others go 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:47.390
 look at either on the internet or else you 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:52.460
 so go ahead start running you 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:55.430
 put tmdc where I wrote ip config 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:57.470
 like that's going to tell you all that you 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:59.690
 go up but look at the bridge 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:02.770
 by default there is an address and acknowledges 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:06.740
 copy it in the google address 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:08.389
 So me if it does not bother us that 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:11.140
 consult it we will try to find 

00:01:08.389 --> 00:01:13.210
 something that looks like 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.159
 the mat in brief the password 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:20.190
 Normally it's admin by default me 

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:20.190
 I changed here 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:25.909
 so once we say ghosn was so 

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:27.740
 on the home page we assure our 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:28.789
 smell we go to the EU we try to 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.079
 find something that looks like 

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:32.450
 nat port 

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:35.990
 all because often worked 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:38.240
 router this device is actually going 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:40.759
 actually have to open manually 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.240
 ports killed less than six teams so 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:43.340
 steam 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:47.259
 tell me do not believe like not estimate 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:51.860
 they ask that so this is good 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:52.780
 already do you for me already the 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.830
 needs of call of 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.240
 already I will teach you with that 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:57.979
 like that after I give you the site and 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.939
 you can do others so me 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:01:59.439
 I need it I'll do 

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:05.720
 it 

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:07.039
 so this is maelsys 1500 dpi so 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.830
 I will put them on my second 

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:12.080
 monitor can see it at the same time 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:15.829
 we will tell you so to see 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:17.750
 it's simple here we put new writing 

00:02:15.829 --> 00:02:19.730
 so the title happy with me it's going 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:23.060
 be moderate by two so 1 for the 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:26.569
 first port the internal port so seen 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.799
 that I need 1500 m and 1500 m of side 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:30.049
 when you have a number, you put two 

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:32.319
 sides for internal than external so 

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:32.319
 then 

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:39.140
 me he does not tell me if it was cp he is p 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:45.459
 wait, I'm just looking at something 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:45.459
 second came in had noted them on his 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:50.300
 okay so apparently it's rather 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:52.640
 udp when it's not specified you put 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:53.420
 udp hoshino you put both of these 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.459
 even simpler 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:58.880
 I know that it was seen from pay 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:03:00.410
 so then you put a sword or tcp 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:04.209
 or both normally it should be 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:06.440
 written and then so you'll put 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:09.980
 the device concerned so me for example 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:11.299
 serial acquired ethernet because I have 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:12.730
 on both since I have where when 

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:16.760
 they wifi when you 're in house is 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:18.739
 so I play it 1500 then the 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.510
 second is 3000 ha no no I said 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:21.470
 in fact if the writings of the dpe that hears 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:23.959
 for me red 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:28.220
 then my age adds the second no 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:33.680
 obviously strong 2.2 tell me udp including 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:35.299
 three doctors 3005 3005 ip has so 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.410
 there I try the apparatus the contest 

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:39.410
 concerned 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:41.660
 if we will play on moder flagship PC is 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:45.040
 will allow xbox com is the device 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:49.880
 with which we will play then 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:52.850
 3101 so had a sword so - finally 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:58.280
 from first three 101 take one thousand one hundred 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:04:00.170
 years of the dp and they ethernet added the 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:03.200
 rule already exists 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:05.810
 3100 it already exists agree for the 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:08.989
 new ah yes maybe is that 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:11.930
 I was already there we will see that their 

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:15.230
 do you get a lease anyway 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:16.519
 little brothel we call them ports 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:17.870
 it's always a bit complicated 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:20.419
 always conflicts between 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:21.560
 different stuff all that usually on 

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:23.690
 always happens to do it but hey 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:25.280
 it's a bit complicated from the fake I think 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:29.300
 because he was already here yes it's already 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:31.010
 there so good me it's the one after good 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:31.910
 me it was to record but it was 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:35.510
 still the port that had to be opened 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:37.750
 and then I had 3101 so it's not 

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:42.979
 this one so we'll change it 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:47.419
 three hundred years around without end then 

00:04:42.979 --> 00:04:50.470
 we will go on so the dp always and 

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:50.470
 try the internet 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:57.680
 so here is where I opened the ports 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:05:00.889
 in question I'm going to you to that so that 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:03.169
 it's this steam port so to put the 

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:04.940
 site you can open to all 

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:06.470
 all this is 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:08.600
 so here it is on the site of steam so 

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:10.510
 really open all that should 

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:13.730
 walk all impeccable 

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:15.110
 so I do not think I can open 

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:16.520
 the game but in any case I have already tried 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:18.020
 a lot of faith from the donkey is now 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:20.480
 she's open so you're just doing 

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:22.900
 a disconnect and then backhouse 

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:22.900
 was acquired
