00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
something I discovered this Halloween

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.810 
something I discovered this Halloween
for<00:00:06.990> the<00:00:07.049> first<00:00:07.230> time<00:00:07.470> thanks<00:00:07.890> to<00:00:08.040> much<00:00:08.429> Egypt

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.850 
for the first time thanks to much Egypt
videos<00:00:09.120> but<00:00:09.929> I'm<00:00:10.019> making<00:00:10.290> one<00:00:10.440> of<00:00:10.530> myself

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
videos but I'm making one of myself

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:12.530 
videos but I'm making one of myself
because<00:00:11.070> it's<00:00:11.460> slightly<00:00:11.969> different

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
because it's slightly different

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.790 
because it's slightly different
I'm<00:00:12.690> anyway<00:00:13.610> all<00:00:14.610> I'm<00:00:14.759> gonna<00:00:14.969> do<00:00:15.179> pumpkins

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:15.800 
I'm anyway all I'm gonna do pumpkins

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.439 
I'm anyway all I'm gonna do pumpkins
that<00:00:16.800> aren't<00:00:17.310> exactly<00:00:17.640> all<00:00:17.910> the<00:00:18.060> way<00:00:18.180> through

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
that aren't exactly all the way through

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.570 
that aren't exactly all the way through
and<00:00:19.230> maybe<00:00:19.470> some<00:00:19.710> of<00:00:19.830> it<00:00:19.920> the<00:00:20.070> holes<00:00:20.250> go<00:00:20.430> all

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
and maybe some of it the holes go all

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.010 
and maybe some of it the holes go all
the<00:00:20.640> way<00:00:20.699> through<00:00:20.880> but<00:00:21.150> something<00:00:21.510> where<00:00:21.689> the

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
the way through but something where the

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.410 
the way through but something where the
design<00:00:22.350> itself<00:00:23.000> doesn't<00:00:24.000> go<00:00:24.240> all<00:00:24.300> the<00:00:24.390> way

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
design itself doesn't go all the way

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.300 
design itself doesn't go all the way
through<00:00:24.660> so<00:00:24.810> I<00:00:24.840> can<00:00:25.080> do<00:00:25.230> a<00:00:25.500> bunch<00:00:25.949> of<00:00:26.070> different

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
through so I can do a bunch of different

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.640 
through so I can do a bunch of different
options<00:00:26.400> and<00:00:26.820> this<00:00:26.939> one<00:00:27.119> is<00:00:27.359> quite<00:00:27.779> easy<00:00:28.230> to<00:00:28.410> do

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
options and this one is quite easy to do

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.440 
options and this one is quite easy to do
so<00:00:29.460> first<00:00:30.269> of<00:00:30.510> all<00:00:30.630> I<00:00:30.660> did<00:00:31.610> this<00:00:32.610> device<00:00:32.969> it's<00:00:33.329> a

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
so first of all I did this device it's a

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.290 
so first of all I did this device it's a
linoleum<00:00:33.750> cutter<00:00:34.200> and<00:00:34.800> it's<00:00:35.550> from<00:00:35.790> speedball

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
linoleum cutter and it's from speedball

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.369 
linoleum cutter and it's from speedball
and<00:00:36.890> it<00:00:37.890> has<00:00:38.390> the<00:00:39.390> hand<00:00:39.600> tool<00:00:39.840> and<00:00:39.870> a<00:00:40.170> little

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
and it has the hand tool and a little

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:41.630 
and it has the hand tool and a little
knife<00:00:40.530> and<00:00:40.739> then<00:00:40.829> these<00:00:40.950> various<00:00:41.399> little

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
knife and then these various little

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.700 
knife and then these various little
things<00:00:41.850> if<00:00:42.090> you<00:00:42.210> remembered<00:00:42.629> from<00:00:42.809> art<00:00:43.620> class

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
things if you remembered from art class

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.500 
things if you remembered from art class
if<00:00:44.100> your<00:00:44.250> art<00:00:44.370> teacher<00:00:44.489> made<00:00:44.760> you<00:00:44.879> do<00:00:45.000> it<00:00:45.149> when

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
if your art teacher made you do it when

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.600 
if your art teacher made you do it when
you<00:00:45.600> did<00:00:45.780> linoleum<00:00:46.289> cuts<00:00:46.530> you<00:00:46.770> it's<00:00:47.399> great

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
you did linoleum cuts you it's great

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.670 
you did linoleum cuts you it's great
when<00:00:47.820> only<00:00:48.059> em<00:00:48.149> and<00:00:48.329> then<00:00:48.420> you<00:00:48.510> can<00:00:48.690> make<00:00:49.559> an

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
when only em and then you can make an

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.529 
when only em and then you can make an
ink<00:00:49.920> print<00:00:50.219> based<00:00:50.520> on<00:00:50.730> whatever<00:00:50.879> you<00:00:51.180> scraped

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
ink print based on whatever you scraped

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.729 
ink print based on whatever you scraped

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
and then to get some holes in it it's

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.810 
and then to get some holes in it it's
fairly<00:02:26.360> easy<00:02:26.530> like<00:02:27.530> it's<00:02:27.830> not<00:02:28.370> much<00:02:28.580> effort

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:28.820 
fairly easy like it's not much effort

fairly easy like it's not much effort
I'm<00:02:29.150> not<00:02:29.270> using<00:02:29.420> a<00:02:29.600> whole<00:02:29.780> lot<00:02:29.960> of<00:02:30.490> muscle

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:31.490 
I'm not using a whole lot of muscle

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:36.070 
I'm not using a whole lot of muscle
power<00:02:32.590> not<00:02:33.590> like<00:02:33.830> I'm<00:02:34.040> scrubbing<00:02:35.080> something

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080 
power not like I'm scrubbing something

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.760

off<00:02:36.230> of<00:02:36.410> it

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:36.770 
off of it

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:43.390 
off of it
dish<00:02:40.570> and<00:02:41.570> then<00:02:41.870> to<00:02:42.290> make<00:02:42.440> some<00:02:42.830> holes<00:02:43.070> you<00:02:43.220> can

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
dish and then to make some holes you can

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:50.050 
dish and then to make some holes you can
make<00:02:43.550> regular<00:02:46.570> and<00:02:47.570> there<00:02:47.810> and<00:02:48.290> then<00:02:49.030> for<00:02:50.030> a
