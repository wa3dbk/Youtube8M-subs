00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
about just one and it has to do with our

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.279 
about just one and it has to do with our
hands<00:00:29.699> and<00:00:30.060> our<00:00:30.179> feet<00:00:30.240> really<00:00:30.660> moving<00:00:31.140> our

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
hands and our feet really moving our

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.250 
hands and our feet really moving our
hands<00:00:31.679> and<00:00:31.830> moving<00:00:32.009> our<00:00:32.219> feet<00:00:32.430> and<00:00:32.809> it's<00:00:33.809> what

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
hands and moving our feet and it's what

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.900 
hands and moving our feet and it's what
we<00:00:34.410> would<00:00:34.530> call<00:00:34.710> it<00:00:34.829> is<00:00:34.920> called<00:00:35.190> hand<00:00:35.460> fighting

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
we would call it is called hand fighting

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.389 
we would call it is called hand fighting
and<00:00:36.120> so<00:00:36.899> we're<00:00:37.050> not<00:00:37.140> necessarily<00:00:37.399> fighting

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
and so we're not necessarily fighting

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.220 
and so we're not necessarily fighting
hands<00:00:38.640> here<00:00:39.149> for<00:00:39.390> control<00:00:39.840> but<00:00:40.079> we're

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
hands here for control but we're

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.930 
hands here for control but we're
actually<00:00:40.440> fighting<00:00:41.070> with<00:00:41.340> our<00:00:41.370> hands<00:00:41.790> almost

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
actually fighting with our hands almost

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:50.240 
actually fighting with our hands almost
like<00:00:42.210> a<00:00:42.239> boxer

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:33.500 
attacks so we're going to color tie as

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.290 
attacks so we're going to color tie as
well<00:01:33.860> we're<00:01:34.040> kind<00:01:34.220> of<00:01:34.310> in<00:01:34.400> an<00:01:34.520> even<00:01:34.940> position

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:00.249 
hard move inside but we got to make sure
we<00:01:57.619> get<00:01:57.800> inside<00:01:58.340> that<00:01:58.670> so<00:01:59.600> we<00:01:59.750> pull<00:01:59.960> it<00:02:00.050> back

00:02:00.249 --> 00:02:00.259 
we get inside that so we pull it back

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:01.990 
we get inside that so we pull it back
that<00:02:00.920> kind<00:02:01.100> of<00:02:01.190> straightens<00:02:01.580> his<00:02:01.640> arm<00:02:01.850> it

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.000 
that kind of straightens his arm it

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.719 
that kind of straightens his arm it
gives<00:02:02.030> us<00:02:02.300> some<00:02:02.450> space<00:02:02.810> we<00:02:03.500> slide<00:02:03.800> inside<00:02:04.430> now

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:04.729 
gives us some space we slide inside now

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:07.540 
gives us some space we slide inside now
at<00:02:04.880> the<00:02:05.000> same<00:02:05.210> time<00:02:05.270> we<00:02:05.780> slide<00:02:06.080> inside<00:02:06.710> we're

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:07.550 
at the same time we slide inside we're

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:12.100 
at the same time we slide inside we're
gonna<00:02:07.670> circle<00:02:08.270> our<00:02:08.450> feet<00:02:08.750> away<00:02:10.180> there<00:02:11.180> so<00:02:11.930> what

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
gonna circle our feet away there so what

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:15.130 
gonna circle our feet away there so what
it<00:02:12.200> looks<00:02:12.230> like<00:02:12.530> is<00:02:12.770> this<00:02:13.540> we<00:02:14.540> come<00:02:14.810> back

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
it looks like is this we come back

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:26.100 
it looks like is this we come back
inside

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:30.520 

now<00:02:27.110> as<00:02:27.440> we<00:02:27.890> come<00:02:28.640> inside<00:02:28.820> in<00:02:29.300> circle<00:02:29.870> that's

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
now as we come inside in circle that's

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:31.720 
now as we come inside in circle that's
when<00:02:30.770> the<00:02:30.890> other<00:02:30.980> hand<00:02:31.340> is<00:02:31.460> going<00:02:31.610> to<00:02:31.670> come

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
when the other hand is going to come

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:33.910 
when the other hand is going to come
across<00:02:32.020> and<00:02:33.020> we're<00:02:33.230> going<00:02:33.350> to<00:02:33.380> pound<00:02:33.770> them

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
across and we're going to pound them

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.600 
across and we're going to pound them
with<00:02:34.070> the<00:02:34.190> other<00:02:34.340> side<00:02:35.410> so<00:02:36.410> we<00:02:36.440> pull<00:02:36.770> back<00:02:37.010> we

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.610 
with the other side so we pull back we

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:40.480 
with the other side so we pull back we
come<00:02:37.880> inside<00:02:38.270> and<00:02:38.960> circle<00:02:39.500> our<00:02:39.620> feet<00:02:39.950> and<00:02:40.280> we

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:40.490 
come inside and circle our feet and we

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:42.730 
come inside and circle our feet and we
count<00:02:40.790> across<00:02:41.210> with<00:02:42.020> the<00:02:42.140> other<00:02:42.290> hand<00:02:42.530> and<00:02:42.650> we

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:42.740 
count across with the other hand and we

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:44.260 
count across with the other hand and we
really<00:02:43.040> are<00:02:43.160> going<00:02:43.340> to<00:02:43.400> wrap<00:02:43.610> them<00:02:43.820> pretty

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:44.270 
really are going to wrap them pretty

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:47.830 
really are going to wrap them pretty
hard<00:02:44.540> right<00:02:45.410> there<00:02:45.470> on<00:02:45.770> the<00:02:45.920> ear<00:02:46.330> so<00:02:47.330> again<00:02:47.690> it

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 
hard right there on the ear so again it

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.260 
hard right there on the ear so again it
looks<00:02:47.870> like<00:02:48.110> this<00:02:48.490> we've<00:02:49.490> come<00:02:49.760> inside<00:02:50.090> with

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:50.270 
looks like this we've come inside with

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:52.840 
looks like this we've come inside with
their<00:02:50.420> left<00:02:50.680> and<00:02:51.680> as<00:02:51.950> we<00:02:52.100> circle<00:02:52.430> we're<00:02:52.730> going

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:52.850

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
to club them with our right so it's

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:59.350

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:19.660 
a good single leg position hand work

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:24.250 
a good single leg position hand work
footwork<00:04:20.980> kind<00:04:21.980> of<00:04:22.070> a<00:04:22.400> little<00:04:23.030> quicker<00:04:23.360> now<00:04:23.480> do

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:24.260 
footwork kind of a little quicker now do

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:25.320 
footwork kind of a little quicker now do
it<00:04:24.320> would<00:04:24.410> look<00:04:24.590> like<00:04:24.650> this
