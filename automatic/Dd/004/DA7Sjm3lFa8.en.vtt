00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.920
 warm good wcc it is today times 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.680
 again time for a new episode bootleg 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:10.800
 bs and you already see in the background 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.509
 mario kart mario kart is considered her the 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.460
 play series in which one very fast 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.880
 get together with his friends 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.520
 can 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.890
 be it because of a flash of one 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.520
 banana or because of this damn march 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.380
 respectively 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:26.699
 i had the race of the bag and 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.300
 Arrive such a shower where we were alas 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.039
 Yes exactly 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.990
 but if you believe that she and her 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.040
 friends are the only ones because of that 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.210
 all this and fairness 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.969
 come together 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.860
 then you are wrong also the actors 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.930
 by super mario kart have enough of 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.219
 robbed victories want the thing like 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.460
 clarify real men 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.270
 that means no party no golf no 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.539
 Soccer 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.890
 no farthing in the kart I fist 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.530
 have the feeling that this bootleg 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.510
 is extremely bad but I will 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.520
 still try and mine 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.149
 present results after the intro 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.149
 have fun 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:15.500
 so now it's off to a beat'em up 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:18.649
 the super mario kart characters on the 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:20.840
 nds and i have to say as bad as 

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:23.210
 I would have expected it is not 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.810
 what a pity because I had to go 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:25.880
 gripe 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.380
 But let's start at the very beginning 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.600
 First of all we have the 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:32.179
 possibility to start the game or 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:34.060
 the option to visit where it is 

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:36.829
 only the difficulty setting gives 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.450
 so we have nothing wrong with that 

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:41.000
 prevents the game from starting 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.409
 jp we have a pretty good one 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.810
 looking character selection screen 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:46.520
 with the eight characters from the first 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.319
 Mario kart for the super nintendo 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.030
 after we have our favorite character 

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:52.189
 have chosen the action goes too 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.259
 already going on there is no story 

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:56.119
 or something like that we just knock 

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:57.500
 too bad about one alone 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:59.659
 small sequence where to get on the 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.649
 kartstrecke is and rammed I would have 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:03.349
 I was very happy 

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:05.090
 the fight starts so it is a best 

00:02:03.349 --> 00:02:07.399
 of three matchup that means you have to 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:09.619
 battles win against someone then 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:11.690
 to fight others because it's a beat'em 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:13.970
 up for the nds is the 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:16.609
 attack possibilities quite strong 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.650
 which usually limits the fighting a lot 

00:02:16.609 --> 00:02:20.840
 monotonous not to say boring 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.239
 power and believing control helps 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.739
 not really 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:26.720
 must be particularly positive 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:28.579
 the spreads are all really pretty 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.889
 Well done are very special 

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:31.430
 juggle or that's peach my 

00:02:30.889 --> 00:02:32.930
 error 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.569
 the only character I have now 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:39.170
 not so well managed is break 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:41.569
 which is just short and fat well 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.730
 also the backgrounds are not 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:44.690
 ugly so I have already clear 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.819
 worse 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:48.709
 the soundtrack is mostly solid 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:50.870
 to good perhaps here and there a 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:53.239
 little exception the a pretty on the 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:55.459
 But sack is not really bad otherwise 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:57.650
 All in all, card is 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:59.389
 Continue one of the better bootlegs not 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:01.130
 as good as the pokÃ©mon stanley around 

00:02:59.389 --> 00:03:03.139
 I talked about last time 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:04.849
 but also no total failure 

00:03:03.139 --> 00:03:06.530
 if you have a little more time 

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:08.660
 would have taken to the lumbering 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:10.160
 Optimize control maybe one 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:12.260
 to incorporate little story 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.280
 and most importantly a two player mode 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.590
 one to program 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:17.930
 then you could play this game quite loose 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:19.430
 on the black market finished and coal 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:21.709
 do not go shopping anymore 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:24.080
 as it is now it is after a few 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:26.090
 fight pretty boring and so 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:27.819
 still better than many others 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:30.350
 bootleg bullshit 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:31.819
 that 's it with the video for today me 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:33.260
 Hope you liked it if so 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:35.120
 then it just shows it 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:37.400
 in the middle of the thumb up or one 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:38.239
 which is of course free 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:40.010
 no question 

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:42.560
 There will be a new video next week 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:46.750
 freudichdrauf I'll do it in any case 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:46.750
 until then skin benefits
