launcher<00:02:24.520> thing<00:02:25.060> that<00:02:25.180> I<00:02:25.210> was<00:02:25.390> talking<00:02:25.780> about

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
launcher thing that I was talking about

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.400 
launcher thing that I was talking about
the<00:02:27.550> concussion<00:02:28.120> rifle<00:02:28.570> he<00:02:28.960> also<00:02:29.140> has<00:02:29.380> a

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
the concussion rifle he also has a

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:32.490 
the concussion rifle he also has a
regeneration<00:02:30.160> thing<00:02:30.810> so<00:02:31.810> you<00:02:31.870> do<00:02:32.050> this<00:02:32.230> and

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
regeneration thing so you do this and

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.140 
regeneration thing so you do this and
everyone<00:02:32.560> in<00:02:32.920> your<00:02:32.950> area<00:02:33.310> regenerates<00:02:33.880> health

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
I believe almost every class as the

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.990 
I believe almost every class as the
commando<00:02:37.600> pistol<00:02:38.020> now<00:02:38.610> which<00:02:39.610> was<00:02:39.790> a<00:02:39.850> lot

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
commando pistol now which was a lot

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.200 
commando pistol now which was a lot
better<00:02:40.240> than<00:02:40.420> the<00:02:40.510> regular<00:02:40.930> blaster<00:02:41.560> pistol

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:42.210 
better than the regular blaster pistol

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:46.980 
better than the regular blaster pistol
and<00:02:43.210> he<00:02:43.540> has<00:02:43.750> the<00:02:44.190> boba<00:02:45.190> fett<00:02:45.400> one<00:02:45.720> for<00:02:46.720> the<00:02:46.780> jet

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:46.990 
and he has the boba fett one for the jet

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:48.540 
and he has the boba fett one for the jet
pack<00:02:47.170> the<00:02:47.380> one<00:02:47.500> that's<00:02:47.680> a<00:02:47.770> boost<00:02:48.010> instead<00:02:48.459> of

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:48.550 
pack the one that's a boost instead of

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:50.600
