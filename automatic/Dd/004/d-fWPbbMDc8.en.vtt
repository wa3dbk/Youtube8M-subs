00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.510
 you do not 

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:11.230
 of reason 

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:12.850
 once we have finished our 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:15.640
 work we have to close all the 

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:18.490
 points we have about the uefa the 

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:20.650
 labor always closes for the reverse is 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:22.600
 say the initial thread we have to 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:24.580
 have to our left and the strand with 

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.029
 the one that we are working with our 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:27.250
 right 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:29.610
 this is the reverse of our work and for 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:31.740
 this is where we're going to close it 

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:34.470
 to close we always have to have in 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.930
 the right needle two points the first 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:41.140
 point we passed as point shore and 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:44.380
 we weave one more point of the right 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:46.450
 we already have two points we raise the 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:49.860
 first knitting stitch helping us from the 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:49.860
 tip of the left needle 

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:57.200
 we pick it up and put it on top of it 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:59.060
 point that the needle remains 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:02.020
 we ride 

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:02.020
 and let's go 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.330
 as now we have a point the needle 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:11.960
 right we have to knit another one 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:14.210
 let's leave another point we have 2 points 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:17.180
 the first knitting stitch we have it 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:19.820
 ride on the last fabric to 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:21.110
 to mount them we lift it helping us 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:22.940
 the needle and the tip of the needle 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:25.550
 left 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:27.890
 we raise the point so that we are not 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:30.910
 leave the point of the right needle we 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:30.910
 we help in index finger 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:37.250
 we count 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.250
 and let's go 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:42.000
 we return to weave another point more 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:49.420
 the tip of the left needle the key 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:52.420
 on the first knitting 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:54.970
 and then we raise it over the last 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:57.149
 knitted weave the last woven knit 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:59.760
 affect with the finger of the right hand 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:03.720
 we ride 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:05.870
 and let's go like that we repeat the rest of the 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.870
 return 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:16.600
 the last point we knit it the same 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.610
 we weave 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:21.460
 we do not have any points left over 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:23.910
 left needle we raise the first 

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:23.910
 point 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:28.520
 we assembled it on the last point 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:35.440
 the right needle 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:35.440
 we pick it up 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:42.950
 and with scissors 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:45.280
 we cut the strand 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:48.120
 this is our job 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.120
 closed
