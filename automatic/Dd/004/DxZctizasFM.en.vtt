is one of the first videos I've taken
where<00:00:22.750> frankly<00:00:23.680> I've<00:00:23.770> let<00:00:23.950> my<00:00:24.310> shop<00:00:24.610> get

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:24.880 
where frankly I've let my shop get

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:27.450 
where frankly I've let my shop get
messier<00:00:25.360> than<00:00:25.480> I<00:00:25.570> like<00:00:25.779> to<00:00:26.020> allow<00:00:26.260> so<00:00:26.619> no<00:00:27.310> good

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:27.460 
messier than I like to allow so no good

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:29.220 
messier than I like to allow so no good
excuse<00:00:27.880> for<00:00:27.910> that<00:00:28.060> and<00:00:28.330> my<00:00:28.570> usual<00:00:28.930> rule<00:00:29.140> of

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:29.230 
excuse for that and my usual rule of

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:30.870 
excuse for that and my usual rule of
thumb<00:00:29.380> is<00:00:29.560> simply<00:00:29.860> not<00:00:29.980> to<00:00:30.189> allow<00:00:30.310> myself<00:00:30.520> to

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:30.880 
thumb is simply not to allow myself to

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.569 
thumb is simply not to allow myself to
work<00:00:31.090> until<00:00:31.330> I<00:00:31.509> clean<00:00:32.040> which<00:00:33.040> usually<00:00:33.220> keeps

this year's it's got a guide measure
here<00:01:59.979> which<00:02:00.130> not<00:02:00.280> only<00:02:00.310> gives<00:02:00.609> you<00:02:00.700> a<00:02:00.729> precise

00:02:01.279 --> 00:02:01.289 
here which not only gives you a precise

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:03.779 
here which not only gives you a precise
depth<00:02:02.289> of<00:02:02.500> the<00:02:02.590> cut<00:02:02.799> but<00:02:03.009> it<00:02:03.100> also<00:02:03.189> keeps<00:02:03.549> the

00:02:03.779 --> 00:02:03.789 
depth of the cut but it also keeps the

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:06.929 
depth of the cut but it also keeps the
cut<00:02:04.090> square<00:02:04.539> so<00:02:05.500> chop<00:02:05.740> that<00:02:05.890> off<00:02:05.950> into<00:02:06.250> 17<00:02:06.700> or

bit of time traveling up these two

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:28.950 
bit of time traveling up these two
points<00:02:26.260> here<00:02:26.500> i<00:02:27.300> used<00:02:28.300> a

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:28.960 
points here i used a

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:33.320 
points here i used a
actually<00:02:29.770> I'll<00:02:29.830> just<00:02:29.860> show<00:02:30.130> you<00:02:30.160> i<00:02:30.310> used<00:02:30.670> a<00:02:30.960> oh

actually I'll just show you i used a oh
not<00:02:34.330> a<00:02:34.360> dial<00:02:34.630> indicator<00:02:34.810> how<00:02:35.260> am<00:02:35.410> I<00:02:36.010> use<00:02:36.310> the

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:36.490 
not a dial indicator how am I use the

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:40.550 
not a dial indicator how am I use the
caliper<00:02:36.970> excuse<00:02:37.210> me<00:02:37.390> to<00:02:37.990> to<00:02:38.890> measure<00:02:39.130> down<00:02:39.490> the

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
caliper excuse me to to measure down the

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.900 
caliper excuse me to to measure down the
decades<00:02:41.560> here<00:02:41.770> function<00:02:42.160> of<00:02:42.250> the<00:02:42.310> caliper<00:02:42.730> to

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
decades here function of the caliper to

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:45.240 
decades here function of the caliper to
measure<00:02:42.940> down<00:02:43.330> to<00:02:43.600> the<00:02:43.750> death<00:02:44.680> of<00:02:44.710> this<00:02:44.920> part

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
measure down to the death of this part

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:47.520 
measure down to the death of this part
to<00:02:45.430> get<00:02:45.520> it<00:02:45.670> exactly<00:02:46.060> it<00:02:46.300> three<00:02:47.020> inches<00:02:47.350> and

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
to get it exactly it three inches and

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:49.110 
to get it exactly it three inches and
then<00:02:47.590> I<00:02:47.710> cut<00:02:47.860> a<00:02:47.890> couple<00:02:48.070> test<00:02:48.580> pieces<00:02:48.820> and

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
then I cut a couple test pieces and

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.940 
then I cut a couple test pieces and
found<00:02:49.330> that<00:02:49.420> you<00:02:50.140> actually<00:02:50.290> need<00:02:50.620> to<00:02:50.650> kind<00:02:50.890> of

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
found that you actually need to kind of

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:52.440 
found that you actually need to kind of
do<00:02:51.100> that<00:02:51.250> and<00:02:51.550> measure<00:02:51.670> the<00:02:51.820> test<00:02:52.030> pieces<00:02:52.240> to

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
do that and measure the test pieces to

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.810 
do that and measure the test pieces to
get<00:02:52.570> it<00:02:52.720> set<00:02:52.900> just<00:02:53.080> right<00:02:53.200> but<00:02:54.010> got<00:02:54.520> that<00:02:54.700> all

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:54.820 
get it set just right but got that all

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:56.430 
get it set just right but got that all
squared<00:02:55.120> up<00:02:55.210> so<00:02:55.450> cut<00:02:55.660> the<00:02:55.690> four<00:02:55.960> corners<00:02:56.320> in

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
squared up so cut the four corners in

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.790 
squared up so cut the four corners in
the<00:02:56.530> piece<00:02:56.760> then<00:02:57.760> I'm<00:02:58.170> got<00:02:59.170> a<00:02:59.200> template<00:02:59.680> which

00:02:59.790 --> 00:02:59.800 
the piece then I'm got a template which

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.400 
the piece then I'm got a template which
I<00:02:59.890> use<00:03:00.100> to<00:03:00.130> mark<00:03:01.030> the<00:03:01.240> holes<00:03:01.420> which<00:03:02.230> you're

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.410 
I use to mark the holes which you're

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:04.290 
I use to mark the holes which you're
seeing<00:03:02.650> in<00:03:02.770> this<00:03:02.860> piece<00:03:03.070> here<00:03:03.400> and<00:03:03.610> then<00:03:03.970> I<00:03:04.060> use

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:04.300 
seeing in this piece here and then I use

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:06.240 
seeing in this piece here and then I use
this<00:03:04.540> cheap<00:03:04.990> i<00:03:05.230> think<00:03:05.440> it<00:03:05.530> was<00:03:05.620> twelve<00:03:06.010> twenty

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
this cheap i think it was twelve twenty

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:07.920 
this cheap i think it was twelve twenty
or<00:03:06.430> thirty<00:03:06.640> dollar<00:03:06.850> punch<00:03:07.240> press<00:03:07.600> from

grizzly to punch all the all of the

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:14.040 
grizzly to punch all the all of the
holes<00:03:11.530> except<00:03:12.070> the<00:03:12.220> two<00:03:12.490> right<00:03:13.240> there<00:03:13.540> which<00:03:13.870> I

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:14.050 
holes except the two right there which I

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:16.320 
holes except the two right there which I
can't<00:03:14.350> reach<00:03:14.590> with<00:03:15.400> the<00:03:15.430> throat<00:03:15.880> of<00:03:16.090> this

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:16.330 
can't reach with the throat of this

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:17.880 
can't reach with the throat of this
punch<00:03:16.900> press<00:03:17.110> which<00:03:17.290> is<00:03:17.320> a<00:03:17.440> real<00:03:17.680> bummer

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:17.890 
punch press which is a real bummer

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:19.890 
punch press which is a real bummer
because<00:03:18.220> I<00:03:18.430> then<00:03:19.060> got<00:03:19.210> to<00:03:19.330> drill<00:03:19.540> the<00:03:19.660> two

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
because I then got to drill the two

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.990 
because I then got to drill the two
little<00:03:20.590> holes<00:03:20.830> which<00:03:21.070> not<00:03:21.250> only<00:03:21.280> takes<00:03:21.640> longer

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
little holes which not only takes longer

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.530 
little holes which not only takes longer
but<00:03:22.120> it's<00:03:22.300> just<00:03:22.540> not<00:03:22.600> nice<00:03:22.990> and<00:03:23.710> clean<00:03:24.070> of<00:03:24.220> a

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
but it's just not nice and clean of a

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:28.520 
but it's just not nice and clean of a
cut<00:03:25.540> anyways<00:03:26.550> from<00:03:27.550> there<00:03:27.790> I<00:03:27.970> start<00:03:28.300> bending

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
cut anyways from there I start bending

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:31.200 
cut anyways from there I start bending
there's<00:03:29.530> the<00:03:29.830> first<00:03:30.340> Bend<00:03:30.610> right<00:03:30.760> there<00:03:31.000> the

you prefer to call up and then finally
the<00:03:38.590> last<00:03:38.950> Bend<00:03:39.550> forms<00:03:40.300> this<00:03:40.510> into<00:03:40.870> a<00:03:40.900> box<00:03:41.310> so

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.310 
the last Bend forms this into a box so

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:45.180 
the last Bend forms this into a box so
that's<00:03:42.490> a<00:03:42.610> three<00:03:42.850> inch<00:03:43.030> deep<00:03:43.660> box<00:03:43.960> it's<00:03:44.830> six

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:45.190 
that's a three inch deep box it's six
