00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
and is consistent in a consistent

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:06.230 
and is consistent in a consistent
pattern<00:01:00.600> or<00:01:01.020> rhythm<00:01:02.030> so<00:01:03.030> once<00:01:03.899> you<00:01:05.090> once<00:01:06.090> you

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
pattern or rhythm so once you once you

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.690 
pattern or rhythm so once you once you
find<00:01:06.570> your<00:01:06.659> bass<00:01:06.840> drops<00:01:07.170> press<00:01:08.130> em<00:01:08.400> on<00:01:08.580> your

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
find your bass drops press em on your

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.730 
find your bass drops press em on your
keyboard<00:01:08.909> you<00:01:09.570> can<00:01:09.600> do<00:01:09.960> this<00:01:10.140> for<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:10.380> snare

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
keyboard you can do this for the snare

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.050 
keyboard you can do this for the snare
so<00:01:11.130> it's<00:01:11.490> this<00:01:12.119> kind<00:01:12.360> of<00:01:12.510> bit<00:01:13.700> the<00:01:14.700> bit<00:01:14.909> that

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
so it's this kind of bit the bit that

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:21.020 
so it's this kind of bit the bit that
goes<00:01:15.240> not<00:01:16.229> like<00:01:16.650> a<00:01:16.680> boom<00:01:18.200> so<00:01:19.200> I<00:01:19.710> prefer<00:01:20.610> to<00:01:20.759> do

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
goes not like a boom so I prefer to do

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.850
