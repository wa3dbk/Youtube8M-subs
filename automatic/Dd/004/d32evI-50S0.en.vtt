there's the price the Moto 360 comes in
at<00:02:44.470> around<00:02:44.560> 200<00:02:44.920> pounds<00:02:45.610> whereas<00:02:46.060> the<00:02:46.180> G<00:02:46.390> watch

is about a hundred and fifty so there's

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:51.030 
is about a hundred and fifty so there's
a<00:02:49.269> price<00:02:49.480> difference<00:02:49.720> certainly<00:02:50.470> but<00:02:50.920> with
