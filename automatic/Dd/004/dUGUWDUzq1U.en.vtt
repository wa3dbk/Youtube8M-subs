00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:06.930
 with this victory he presents them with free professional training 

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:13.739
 more private resources in www sprint com with this victory the written 

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:18.639
 sponsored by jobs as advertising 

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:32.839
 let's continue explaining some basic housing functions 

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:37.280
 if we are working inside a dinner that contains many objects 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.300
 then it will be difficult 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.230
 looking if we can build them would be interesting every time we create a 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.750
 new object rename it so that it is much easier to locate 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.280
 to name an object we can do it in two ways 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.540
 On the one hand we can do it if we are working in the itin mode 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.550
 from ccoo see if we click we will be able to modify mt cubelo I will 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:00.910
 marcum castellano 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:02.550
 the precarious 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.620
 already modified the name the other way to do it is from the panel 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:09.840
 Pauline visualization 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.380
 from here we can see all the objects that we have inside 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.030
 of our composition 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.420
 and if we do click control on a man for example the camera 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:23.720
 He explained and we are going to call the main camera for example print city peace 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.250
 we are without troops can be modified in the same way 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:29.150
 not subject 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:32.770
 I renamed all of them and then possibly it's much simpler 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:36.180
 find them especially when we have many subjects 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.180
 from this panel on the right you can see three icons 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:42.180
 the eye the arrow in the image 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:47.270
 the eye what it is going to do is allow to visualize how to visualize an element 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:49.610
 within our composition 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.520
 for example the cube is still active what has been deactivated we will be able to visualize it 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.220
 when to visualize it 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:59.120
 the date what it will do will be what we do or element as we did 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.490
 in photoshop with the padlock 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:04.659
 what it will do is block our element so that they are not 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:06.970
 selectable or modifiable 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:08.020
 if we 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:12.430
 we have disabled we will not be able to select or modify subject 

00:02:13.419 --> 00:02:18.309
 the last icon the image what it will do will be shown by not showing us this 

00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:21.569
 gesture the blues order of the end when we export 

00:02:22.429 --> 00:02:26.979
 our result can we indicate if we want an object to be 

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:29.979
 visible one is visible from the image 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:33.569
 denver just like photoshop works with layers 

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:35.549
 we can of the layer 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:39.650
 from here on the icons these little ones we can work with 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:43.049
 the many layers of ours that are vent in total 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:47.670
 we will be able to modify by selecting several layers by pressing 

00:02:47.669 --> 00:02:49.909
 the shift key 

00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:52.629
 we see that we are activated gray 

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:55.629
 all the layers that we need 

00:02:56.229 --> 00:03:01.010
 if we wanted to move an object from another layer, for example the lamp 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:04.750
 the selection or with the right button and pressed the key m 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:09.139
 but it appeared manu china indicate where I want to have 

00:03:09.139 --> 00:03:10.139
 nor object 

00:03:10.139 --> 00:03:12.859
 in this case the numbered layer I have to go 

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:16.999
 and I would automatically change my object to the capaco deactivate it 

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:21.169
 visualize it only to her ovi soloists 

00:03:21.169 --> 00:03:24.479
 both 

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:28.469
 let's go back to live 3d visualization mode and let's 

00:03:28.469 --> 00:03:31.819
 explain how we can copy objects 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:36.239
 now he to now duplicate an object there are two ways to do it or copy 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:37.829
 I could tilt it 

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:41.989
 if we copy it what we're doing this chop an object in a way 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:43.629
 Independent 

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:46.389
 whereas if what we do is clone it 

00:03:46.389 --> 00:03:50.359
 what we are going to do is make a copy and if we apply a 

00:03:50.359 --> 00:03:54.079
 modification on one of them in the same way this modification is going 

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:56.690
 apply on the rest of cloned objects 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:58.469
 let's see an example 

00:03:58.469 --> 00:04:01.849
 to copy an object I'm going to select it with the right button 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:03.619
 and tighten 

00:04:03.619 --> 00:04:05.429
 Yes it is 

00:04:05.429 --> 00:04:09.809
 in this way what I do is pleasure an independent copy of my object 

00:04:09.809 --> 00:04:13.099
 he squeezed suppress and I tell him heras 

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:17.350
 if instead of copying I do it with the shift key of what I want to do is 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:21.110
 clone an object I'm going to have to do it by pressing the combination of 

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:23.639
 high keys 

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:26.639
 he injured himself geto squeezed high 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:32.290
 colon an object in that case what you have done is a cloning this wants 

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:35.699
 say that if there is any modification for example color 

00:04:35.699 --> 00:04:37.360
 he applied a red color 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:42.080
 this choir is going to modify the two parts because it even continued from edith 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:42.969
 mode 

00:04:42.969 --> 00:04:44.770
 some modification 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:46.629
 on one side 

00:04:46.629 --> 00:04:48.090
 for example here 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:50.690
 we see that the modification is going to apply 

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:54.420
 in the same way to the ducks the objects that I have cloned 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:56.120
 following this method
