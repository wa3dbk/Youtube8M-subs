00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:15.410
 hello youtube friends good as we saw 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:18.560
 in the previous tutorial we learned to 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:20.269
 mount an iso on a pendrive and do it 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:21.859
 a reliable boat to start and mount 

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:23.890
 our operating system in the 

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:27.439
 computer that we had freshly assembled 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:29.520
 then the pendrive we put it in a 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:32.000
 port that is free 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:33.900
 there it is and now we would go to the road 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.340
 normally it does it automatically 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:37.920
 when we turn on the computer and 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:41.220
 would start booting from usb and if not 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.320
 we configure it in the bios 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:46.380
 well now that we have our 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.480
 usb in our memory by the system 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:50.730
 operative windows 8 that is the time to 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.260
 start also you can observe here 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.980
 as the hard drive I have not put the 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.870
 top because if it is better refrigerated 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:01.370
 we boot and if it does not boot the usb time 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.370
 Well, we're going to the bios 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:08.010
 and we see how it is configured 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:11.310
 if we do not hear the beep 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.840
 we leave the south key delete enter 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.210
 in the bio that is here handled with the 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.540
 mouse and we go here where the 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.990
 putt 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.920
 acan and here we see the disc is no longer 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.770
 hard the unit 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:25.930
 of dvd and what our needs 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:28.120
 device you see that at that moment 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:30.220
 Boot 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:32.560
 which is going to sing from there 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:35.790
 then we are going to 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.790
 the if we left 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:42.060
 and now the starting moments already 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:42.060
 have to boot from the usb memory 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:48.560
 know it 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:50.060
 there you see the windows window 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.930
 which means that it is booting 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:56.049
 from the usb memory where we install 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:56.049
 windows 8 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:03.690
 now it will take a while and now between the 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.690
 video go explain step by step 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:08.240
 well this is the first window that we 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.500
 it's going to look like which the 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:12.920
 language that is going to be installed in this case 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:15.320
 Spanish form all king currency and keyboard 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:18.050
 input method also in Spanish what 

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:19.750
 which we follow and we give to next and 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:23.510
 now we get the window install now 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:26.590
 we click here and we wait for the program 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.590
 installation is starting 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:33.760
 well now we put our key to 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:36.989
 windows 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.989
 and we give you next 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.920
 and once we have introduced our 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:45.500
 license appears to us from the terms of 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:47.180
 the license we give you to accept the 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.520
 terms of the license and we give to 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:51.710
 next now we see two 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:53.600
 options where is install update 

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:55.130
 windows and preserve files in this 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.990
 case not because the hard drive is empty 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:03:00.060
 which we are going to do new ministry 

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:01.650
 We give customized 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:04.890
 we have here our drive that 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:07.950
 It is empty and we give it to next to 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:12.560
 that did not leave here next and now 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:12.560
 will begin to load the files 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:18.920
 this comes as last about half an hour 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:20.870
 depending on our computer 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:23.650
 and as it says here the equipment will be realized 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:23.650
 several times 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:29.560
 and now the next screen that we 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:32.080
 appears is to customize both a 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:34.900
 color with our configuration as a 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:39.660
 name me in this case I'm going to put 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:39.660
 blue and I'm going to put 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:47.080
 home and we give it to next 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:51.450
 and now that we have put a name to go 

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:52.859
 we have changed the color we enter this 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:55.469
 configuration screen that has the 

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:58.400
 options below quick or the 

00:03:55.469 --> 00:04:00.719
 Personalized I recommend the quick 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:01.950
 than automatically install 

00:04:00.719 --> 00:04:05.090
 important updates and 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:08.340
 recommended then we give you use 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:10.220
 quick setup and here we put a 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:13.990
 Username 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:13.990
 which for example in this case would be 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:19.010
 low 

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:20.600
 and then later if we want to 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:23.270
 can also put a password 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:26.770
 we would finish 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:26.770
 finalizing the configuration 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:31.659
 and welcomes us 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:37.180
 And here we have our factory 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:40.720
 start of windows 8 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:42.669
 giving it here we go to the desk that 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:44.199
 is very similar to the previous windows 7 the 

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:46.660
 another one that you have removed the button 

00:04:44.199 --> 00:04:48.400
 good start because until now it has arrived 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:50.710
 this tutorial to comment windows 8 on 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:53.229
 our newly assembled computer we have 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:55.919
 learned to assemble a computer to assemble 

00:04:53.229 --> 00:04:59.080
 an iso on a pendrive to do it 

00:04:55.919 --> 00:05:02.740
 bootable vote speak and then it will be 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:04.800
 windows 8 if you liked like and 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:06.460

 soon to new tutorials 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:09.970
 about interesting programs that I think 

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:11.770
 that can be useful for all 

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:14.280
