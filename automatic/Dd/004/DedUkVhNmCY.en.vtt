cool huh there's a zuki bandit 650 E as
a<00:00:13.860> replacement<00:00:14.099> bike<00:00:14.490> my<00:00:15.360> bikes<00:00:15.630> in<00:00:15.780> the<00:00:15.840> shop

00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:16.369 
a replacement bike my bikes in the shop

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:18.800 
a replacement bike my bikes in the shop
as<00:00:17.369> you<00:00:17.519> know<00:00:17.640> someone<00:00:17.970> reversed<00:00:18.269> into<00:00:18.480> me<00:00:18.630> so

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
as you know someone reversed into me so

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.200 
as you know someone reversed into me so
it's<00:00:18.960> just<00:00:19.079> being<00:00:19.259> checked<00:00:19.529> over<00:00:19.880> and<00:00:20.880> this<00:00:21.029> is

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
it's just being checked over and this is

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.739 
it's just being checked over and this is
there<00:00:21.449> a<00:00:21.890> loner<00:00:23.239> there's<00:00:24.239> things<00:00:24.449> I<00:00:24.539> like

00:00:24.739 --> 00:00:24.749 
there a loner there's things I like

00:00:24.749 --> 00:00:25.939 
there a loner there's things I like
about<00:00:24.779> it<00:00:25.019> the<00:00:25.169> things<00:00:25.409> I<00:00:25.499> don't<00:00:25.560> like<00:00:25.710> that

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
about it the things I don't like that

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.669 
about it the things I don't like that
one<00:00:26.699> thing<00:00:26.880> I<00:00:26.999> do<00:00:27.689> like<00:00:27.720> that<00:00:28.109> it<00:00:28.289> it's<00:00:28.439> not<00:00:28.619> a

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:28.679 
one thing I do like that it it's not a

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:31.999 
one thing I do like that it it's not a
parallel<00:00:29.069> twin<00:00:30.349> so<00:00:31.349> the<00:00:31.499> engines<00:00:31.829> much

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
parallel twin so the engines much

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.170 
parallel twin so the engines much
smoother<00:00:33.140> its<00:00:34.140> initial<00:00:34.440> torque<00:00:34.950> is<00:00:35.610> really

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
smoother its initial torque is really

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.320 
smoother its initial torque is really
good<00:00:36.360> so<00:00:36.960> 0<00:00:37.410> to<00:00:37.500> 60<00:00:37.980> is<00:00:38.040> really<00:00:38.310> fast<00:00:38.520> about<00:00:39.180> the

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:39.330 
good so 0 to 60 is really fast about the

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:41.810 
good so 0 to 60 is really fast about the
same<00:00:39.480> as<00:00:39.720> the<00:00:39.930> ER<00:00:40.350> six<00:00:40.650> then<00:00:41.040> it<00:00:41.160> plateaus<00:00:41.430> at

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
same as the ER six then it plateaus at

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:48.830 
same as the ER six then it plateaus at
about<00:00:42.030> 70<00:00:42.780> comes<00:00:43.590> a<00:00:43.680> very<00:00:43.890> big<00:00:44.190> dead<00:00:44.460> spot<00:00:47.840> one

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
about 70 comes a very big dead spot one

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.110 
about 70 comes a very big dead spot one
thing<00:00:49.020> I<00:00:49.110> find<00:00:49.320> really<00:00:50.040> annoying<00:00:50.520> is<00:00:50.790> it's<00:00:51.000> got

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
thing I find really annoying is it's got

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.480 
thing I find really annoying is it's got
a<00:00:51.180> gear<00:00:51.450> indicator<00:00:51.720> which<00:00:52.470> most<00:00:52.740> people<00:00:52.920> would

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:53.490 
a gear indicator which most people would

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:57.380 
a gear indicator which most people would
probably<00:00:53.520> find<00:00:54.060> useful<00:00:55.760> now<00:00:56.760> I<00:00:56.790> find<00:00:57.240> it

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
probably find useful now I find it

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.170 
probably find useful now I find it
really<00:00:57.510> really<00:00:57.950> really<00:00:58.950> annoying<00:00:59.370> good<00:01:00.090> i
