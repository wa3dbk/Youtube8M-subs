Hello, Welcome to Neeta In Kitchen.

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.690
Today we are going to prepare Homemade Fresh Cream.

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:15.980
I have never got cream from shops whenever I make gravies

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.580
that call for cream and trust me add few tbsp. of fresh Cream for any gravy,

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:24.720
it takes the gravy to a whole new level.

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.940
So let’s see the ingredients needed.

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:30.269
We need.  1 Cup Malai

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.509
and 1/4 cup of milk

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.600
Take a large jar and pour malai in it.

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.160
Now pour milk in it.

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.400
If you add some water in the place of milk,

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:51.080
then we will get butter instead of cream.

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.720
Now we will beat it with the help of electric beater.

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.560
If you don’t have electric beater then you can use

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:01.760
mixer grinder or hand beater to beat it.

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.500
Beat it well for few minutes till you observe

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.120
it creamy and without any lumps.

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.920
Our homemade Fresh Cream is ready to use.

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.660
Use this fresh cream in Ice Cream, Tomato Soup,

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:23.080
Panner Tikka Masala and so on.

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:27.770
Store it in refrigerator and enjoy for next couple of days.

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:31.900
So prepare it at your home &amp; share your experience with me.

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:34.720
