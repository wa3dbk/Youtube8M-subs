things like that I like the postman try
to<00:02:16.080> deliver<00:02:16.500> so<00:02:17.070> this<00:02:17.490> gameplay<00:02:17.730> you<00:02:17.940> can<00:02:18.180> see

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
to deliver so this gameplay you can see

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.600 
to deliver so this gameplay you can see
in<00:02:18.420> the<00:02:18.480> background<00:02:18.510> is<00:02:19.230> a<00:02:19.290> nuclear<00:02:20.040> on<00:02:20.280> black

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
in the background is a nuclear on black

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.880 
in the background is a nuclear on black
ops<00:02:20.820> 2<00:02:21.090> and<00:02:21.840> the<00:02:21.960> reason<00:02:22.230> I<00:02:22.260> put<00:02:22.470> this<00:02:22.560> one<00:02:22.770> up

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
ops 2 and the reason I put this one up

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.040 
ops 2 and the reason I put this one up
is<00:02:23.040> because<00:02:23.190> as<00:02:23.670> I<00:02:23.970> say<00:02:24.210> one<00:02:24.480> of<00:02:24.510> the<00:02:24.630> comments

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
is because as I say one of the comments

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:26.420 
is because as I say one of the comments
came<00:02:25.230> in<00:02:25.410> and<00:02:25.560> somebody<00:02:25.680> said<00:02:26.010> you<00:02:26.190> know<00:02:26.280> what

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
came in and somebody said you know what

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:27.830 
came in and somebody said you know what

I've been subscribed to you now for

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.840 
I've been subscribed to you now for

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
and I don't believe that I've seen a

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.400 
and I don't believe that I've seen a
nuclear<00:02:32.520> game<00:02:32.700> plan<00:02:32.940> your<00:02:33.150> channel<00:02:33.480> is<00:02:33.630> there

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
nuclear game plan your channel is there

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:35.930 
nuclear game plan your channel is there
any<00:02:34.530> reason<00:02:34.740> for<00:02:34.980> this<00:02:35.160> and<00:02:35.370> easy<00:02:35.490> possible

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
any reason for this and easy possible

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.150 
any reason for this and easy possible
you<00:02:36.030> can<00:02:36.150> put<00:02:36.360> one<00:02:36.510> up<00:02:36.660> now<00:02:37.290> there<00:02:37.650> is<00:02:37.770> a<00:02:37.800> reason

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
you can put one up now there is a reason

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:39.710 
you can put one up now there is a reason
why<00:02:38.310> I've<00:02:38.400> never<00:02:38.550> put<00:02:38.790> a<00:02:38.820> nuclear<00:02:39.240> gameplay<00:02:39.660> up

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
why I've never put a nuclear gameplay up

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.420 
why I've never put a nuclear gameplay up
and<00:02:39.930> that<00:02:40.050> is<00:02:40.170> because<00:02:40.290> I<00:02:40.680> don't<00:02:40.980> go<00:02:41.130> out<00:02:41.190> to

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
and that is because I don't go out to

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:42.740 
and that is because I don't go out to
find<00:02:41.459> them<00:02:41.850> because<00:02:42.209> they<00:02:42.360> don't<00:02:42.540> really

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
find them because they don't really

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.260 
find them because they don't really
interest<00:02:43.170> me<00:02:43.490> it's<00:02:44.490> not<00:02:44.730> that<00:02:44.850> I<00:02:44.940> think<00:02:45.150> the

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:45.270 
interest me it's not that I think the

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:47.350 
interest me it's not that I think the
shit<00:02:45.510> I<00:02:45.780> think<00:02:45.990> it<00:02:46.200> quite<00:02:46.440> difficult<00:02:46.709> to<00:02:47.040> get

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
shit I think it quite difficult to get

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.610 
shit I think it quite difficult to get
realistically<00:02:48.360> because<00:02:48.720> it's<00:02:48.870> all<00:02:49.050> just<00:02:49.320> gone

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
realistically because it's all just gone

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.800 
realistically because it's all just gone
on<00:02:49.650> gun<00:02:50.100> kills<00:02:50.430> and<00:02:50.790> the<00:02:51.360> killstreaks

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
on gun kills and the killstreaks

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.020 
on gun kills and the killstreaks
contributes<00:02:52.350> are<00:02:52.500> nothing<00:02:52.800> but<00:02:52.830> for<00:02:53.820> me<00:02:54.000> a

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
contributes are nothing but for me a

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.390 
contributes are nothing but for me a
nuclear<00:02:54.660> doesn't<00:02:55.080> have<00:02:55.290> that<00:02:55.500> desired<00:02:56.040> effect

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
nuclear doesn't have that desired effect

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.729 
nuclear doesn't have that desired effect
of<00:02:56.550> what<00:02:56.730> i<00:02:56.760> like<00:02:57.120> i<00:02:57.360> like<00:02:57.600> the<00:02:57.810> boom<00:02:58.110> I<00:02:58.500> like

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
of what i like i like the boom I like

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:00.320 
of what i like i like the boom I like
the<00:02:58.920> explosion<00:02:59.489> that's<00:02:59.610> why<00:02:59.880> like<00:03:00.060> to<00:03:00.239> go

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
the explosion that's why like to go

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:01.790

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
same the nuclear for me didn't have that

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:35.630 
same the nuclear for me didn't have that
effect<00:03:33.989> because<00:03:34.380> it<00:03:34.470> was<00:03:34.590> basically<00:03:34.799> just<00:03:35.459> an

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 
effect because it was basically just an

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.280 
effect because it was basically just an
acknowledgement<00:03:35.790> on<00:03:36.450> the<00:03:36.570> screen<00:03:36.870> there<00:03:37.200> you

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
acknowledgement on the screen there you

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:39.440 
acknowledgement on the screen there you
go<00:03:37.440> you've<00:03:37.620> got<00:03:37.650> a<00:03:37.799> nuclear<00:03:38.269> fantastic<00:03:39.269> or

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
go you've got a nuclear fantastic or

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:41.180 
go you've got a nuclear fantastic or
you're<00:03:39.600> unstoppable<00:03:39.989> you<00:03:40.530> know<00:03:40.650> you<00:03:40.709> carrying

you're unstoppable you know you carrying
gone<00:03:41.370> through<00:03:41.580> your<00:03:41.700> nuclear<00:03:42.120> so<00:03:42.660> I<00:03:42.720> you<00:03:42.930> know

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:43.049 
gone through your nuclear so I you know

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:44.600 
gone through your nuclear so I you know
I<00:03:43.170> fully<00:03:43.470> respect<00:03:43.650> people<00:03:44.190> who<00:03:44.220> do<00:03:44.430> get

nuclear's<00:03:45.120> this<00:03:45.450> is<00:03:45.600> on<00:03:45.750> 6v6<00:03:46.200> tedium<00:03:46.860> and<00:03:46.950> I

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
nuclear's this is on 6v6 tedium and I

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.620 
nuclear's this is on 6v6 tedium and I
think<00:03:47.250> it's<00:03:47.400> a<00:03:47.489> little<00:03:47.610> bit<00:03:47.730> harder<00:03:48.239> plus<00:03:48.510> it

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:48.630 
think it's a little bit harder plus it

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:50.960 
think it's a little bit harder plus it
someone<00:03:49.049> with<00:03:49.260> the<00:03:49.350> worst<00:03:49.590> maps<00:03:49.920> in<00:03:50.160> black<00:03:50.760> ops

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
someone with the worst maps in black ops

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:52.880 
someone with the worst maps in black ops
2<00:03:51.090> and<00:03:51.360> it<00:03:51.420> was<00:03:51.540> kind<00:03:51.780> of<00:03:51.840> a<00:03:51.930> grind<00:03:52.350> out<00:03:52.560> to<00:03:52.709> get

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:52.890 
2 and it was kind of a grind out to get

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:55.699 
2 and it was kind of a grind out to get
E<00:03:52.920> and<00:03:53.160> I<00:03:53.970> didn't<00:03:54.450> sort<00:03:54.750> of<00:03:54.840> set<00:03:55.140> out<00:03:55.350> to<00:03:55.530> get

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:55.709 
E and I didn't sort of set out to get

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:57.350 
E and I didn't sort of set out to get
one<00:03:55.830> essentially<00:03:56.400> I<00:03:56.430> started<00:03:57.060> out<00:03:57.180> playing

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:57.360 
one essentially I started out playing

one essentially I started out playing
normally<00:03:57.959> you<00:03:58.260> know<00:03:58.380> what<00:03:58.530> I<00:03:58.560> did<00:03:58.799> notice<00:03:59.010> as

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
normally you know what I did notice as

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:00.560 
normally you know what I did notice as
the<00:03:59.519> game<00:03:59.730> was<00:03:59.880> going<00:04:00.060> on<00:04:00.269> according

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:00.570 
the game was going on according

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:02.240 
the game was going on according
lightning<00:04:01.230> strikes<00:04:01.590> and<00:04:01.830> things<00:04:02.040> like<00:04:02.190> that

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 
lightning strikes and things like that

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:03.710 
lightning strikes and things like that
and<00:04:02.430> I'm<00:04:02.549> I<00:04:02.640> need<00:04:02.760> you<00:04:02.850> to<00:04:02.970> notice<00:04:03.330> that<00:04:03.510> I<00:04:03.540> was

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 
and I'm I need you to notice that I was

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.780 
and I'm I need you to notice that I was
staying<00:04:03.959> alive<00:04:04.350> a<00:04:04.410> little<00:04:04.620> bit<00:04:04.890> and<00:04:05.100> that<00:04:05.640> the

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790 
staying alive a little bit and that the

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:07.640 
staying alive a little bit and that the
score<00:04:06.060> wasn't<00:04:06.299> going<00:04:06.660> up<00:04:06.780> rapidly<00:04:07.170> and<00:04:07.410> then<00:04:07.560> I

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
score wasn't going up rapidly and then I

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:09.319 
score wasn't going up rapidly and then I
just<00:04:07.709> decided<00:04:07.980> hate<00:04:08.489> you<00:04:08.700> know<00:04:08.820> what<00:04:09.000> I<00:04:09.030> won't

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:09.329 
just decided hate you know what I won't

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:11.569 
just decided hate you know what I won't
use<00:04:09.540> any<00:04:09.750> more<00:04:09.989> of<00:04:10.110> my<00:04:10.260> streaks<00:04:10.650> I<00:04:10.829> will<00:04:11.400> just

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:11.579 
use any more of my streaks I will just

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:12.800 
use any more of my streaks I will just
go<00:04:11.700> out<00:04:11.820> there<00:04:11.940> and<00:04:12.000> see<00:04:12.269> if<00:04:12.329> I<00:04:12.450> can<00:04:12.630> get<00:04:12.750> a

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
go out there and see if I can get a

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:15.140 
go out there and see if I can get a
nuclear<00:04:13.170> so<00:04:13.709> that<00:04:13.920> is<00:04:14.040> what<00:04:14.220> I<00:04:14.250> did<00:04:14.400> and<00:04:14.790> I

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150 
nuclear so that is what I did and I

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:17.030 
nuclear so that is what I did and I
succeeded<00:04:15.720> I<00:04:16.019> hope<00:04:16.350> the<00:04:16.500> person<00:04:16.919> the

not kind of you know just shaved off the
end<00:04:28.380> and<00:04:28.620> I<00:04:29.160> noticed<00:04:29.610> the<00:04:29.820> sort<00:04:30.090> of<00:04:30.180> last<00:04:30.509> final

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:35.100 
was to split screeners there and you

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:37.279 
was to split screeners there and you
know<00:04:35.190> what<00:04:35.340> realistically<00:04:36.030> it<00:04:36.539> left<00:04:36.900> a<00:04:37.020> sort

00:04:37.279 --> 00:04:37.289 
know what realistically it left a sort

00:04:37.289 --> 00:04:39.850 
know what realistically it left a sort
of<00:04:37.410> bit<00:04:37.770> of<00:04:37.860> an<00:04:37.949> empty<00:04:38.430> feeling<00:04:38.759> in<00:04:39.210> my<00:04:39.389> soul

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:39.860

knives and stuff like that that was
quite<00:06:25.919> fun<00:06:26.220> the<00:06:26.909> one<00:06:27.090> thing<00:06:27.240> I<00:06:27.419> do<00:06:27.479> remember

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:27.750 
quite fun the one thing I do remember

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:29.480 
quite fun the one thing I do remember
about<00:06:28.050> it<00:06:28.320> though<00:06:28.470> was<00:06:28.650> there<00:06:28.860> was<00:06:28.979> no<00:06:29.220> actual

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:29.490 
about it though was there was no actual

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:31.820 
about it though was there was no actual
decent<00:06:30.360> peripheral<00:06:30.870> vision<00:06:31.260> you<00:06:31.440> know<00:06:31.560> it's

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:31.830 
decent peripheral vision you know it's

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:34.879 
decent peripheral vision you know it's
very<00:06:32.070> sort<00:06:32.430> of<00:06:32.520> narrow<00:06:32.880> and<00:06:33.150> closed<00:06:33.539> off<00:06:33.889> you

00:06:34.879 --> 00:06:34.889 
very sort of narrow and closed off you

00:06:34.889 --> 00:06:36.560 
very sort of narrow and closed off you
know<00:06:35.010> you<00:06:35.310> can<00:06:35.460> either<00:06:35.580> have<00:06:35.760> a<00:06:35.789> vertical<00:06:36.120> or

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:36.570 
know you can either have a vertical or

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:38.180 
know you can either have a vertical or
horizontal<00:06:36.599> I<00:06:37.229> believe<00:06:37.500> I'm<00:06:37.680> I<00:06:37.860> can't

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:38.190 
horizontal I believe I'm I can't

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:40.399 
horizontal I believe I'm I can't
remember<00:06:38.400> but<00:06:38.789> yeah<00:06:39.000> you've<00:06:39.419> got<00:06:39.719> no<00:06:39.930> proof

00:06:40.399 --> 00:06:40.409 
remember but yeah you've got no proof

00:06:40.409 --> 00:06:41.869 
remember but yeah you've got no proof
vision<00:06:40.709> you<00:06:40.830> can't<00:06:41.099> see<00:06:41.309> what<00:06:41.489> he's<00:06:41.519> coming

00:06:41.869 --> 00:06:41.879 
vision you can't see what he's coming

00:06:41.879 --> 00:06:43.279 
vision you can't see what he's coming
from<00:06:42.029> every<00:06:42.269> angle<00:06:42.300> and<00:06:42.569> this<00:06:42.839> is<00:06:43.019> why<00:06:43.259> I

00:06:43.279 --> 00:06:43.289 
from every angle and this is why I

00:06:43.289 --> 00:06:45.949 
from every angle and this is why I
believe<00:06:43.800> that<00:06:43.830> split<00:06:44.339> screeners<00:06:44.819> do<00:06:45.330> terrible

00:06:45.949 --> 00:06:45.959 
believe that split screeners do terrible

00:06:45.959 --> 00:06:47.959 
believe that split screeners do terrible
these<00:06:46.259> guys<00:06:46.499> are<00:06:46.679> probably<00:06:46.800> good<00:06:47.159> but<00:06:47.789> they

00:06:47.959 --> 00:06:47.969 
these guys are probably good but they

00:06:47.969 --> 00:06:50.540 
these guys are probably good but they
don't<00:06:48.300> have<00:06:48.389> the<00:06:48.569> 100<00:06:49.259> temps<00:06:49.769> and<00:06:49.949> peripheral

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:50.550 
don't have the 100 temps and peripheral

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:52.219 
don't have the 100 temps and peripheral
vision<00:06:50.939> that<00:06:51.419> you<00:06:51.539> would<00:06:51.689> have<00:06:51.839> if<00:06:51.989> you<00:06:52.019> as

00:06:52.219 --> 00:06:52.229 
vision that you would have if you as

00:06:52.229 --> 00:06:54.619 
vision that you would have if you as
playing<00:06:52.469> as<00:06:52.619> normal<00:06:53.009> so<00:06:53.189> what<00:06:53.580> I<00:06:53.610> believe<00:06:54.179> this

00:06:54.619 --> 00:06:54.629 
playing as normal so what I believe this

00:06:54.629 --> 00:06:57.199 
playing as normal so what I believe this
is<00:06:54.779> my<00:06:54.959> own<00:06:55.050> personal<00:06:55.339> opinion<00:06:56.339> I<00:06:56.489> suppose<00:06:56.939> is

00:06:57.199 --> 00:06:57.209 
is my own personal opinion I suppose is

00:06:57.209 --> 00:06:59.779 
is my own personal opinion I suppose is
the<00:06:57.809> call<00:06:58.080> of<00:06:58.229> duty<00:06:58.589> should<00:06:58.860> segregate<00:06:59.580> out

00:06:59.779 --> 00:06:59.789 
the call of duty should segregate out

00:06:59.789 --> 00:07:01.369 
the call of duty should segregate out
the<00:06:59.999> split<00:07:00.330> screeners<00:07:00.749> because<00:07:00.959> it<00:07:01.050> gave<00:07:01.229> me

00:07:01.369 --> 00:07:01.379 
the split screeners because it gave me

00:07:01.379 --> 00:07:03.379 
the split screeners because it gave me
knows<00:07:01.589> who<00:07:01.830> they<00:07:02.039> are<00:07:02.069> it's<00:07:02.429> a<00:07:02.669> great<00:07:03.029> at<00:07:03.300> the

00:07:05.119 --> 00:07:05.129 
split screeners and put them into

00:07:05.129 --> 00:07:06.859 
split screeners and put them into
lobbies<00:07:05.489> with<00:07:05.639> other<00:07:05.789> split<00:07:06.119> screeners<00:07:06.629> so

00:07:06.859 --> 00:07:06.869 
lobbies with other split screeners so
