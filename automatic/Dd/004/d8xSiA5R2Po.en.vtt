bit of research and we think that's an

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.160 
bit of research and we think that's an

American term it certainly it just means

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.910 
American term it certainly it just means

jacuzzi<00:02:23.830> animate<00:02:24.400> hot<00:02:24.610> tub<00:02:24.819> so<00:02:25.030> in<00:02:25.540> the<00:02:25.900> last

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:25.989 
jacuzzi animate hot tub so in the last

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:28.229 
jacuzzi animate hot tub so in the last
10<00:02:26.410> years<00:02:26.440> I<00:02:26.769> think<00:02:26.980> you're<00:02:27.069> fine<00:02:27.250> whereas<00:02:28.209> a

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:28.239 
10 years I think you're fine whereas a

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:30.540 
10 years I think you're fine whereas a
lot<00:02:28.540> of<00:02:28.630> manufacturers<00:02:29.080> have<00:02:29.349> been<00:02:29.550> certainly

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:30.550 
lot of manufacturers have been certainly

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:33.330 
lot of manufacturers have been certainly
30<00:02:30.819> years<00:02:31.120> or<00:02:31.239> more<00:02:31.390> so<00:02:31.959> um<00:02:32.319> I<00:02:32.739> would<00:02:33.130> imagine

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
30 years or more so um I would imagine

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.370 
30 years or more so um I would imagine
that<00:02:33.550> they're<00:02:33.849> very<00:02:34.030> sort<00:02:34.420> of<00:02:34.450> eco<00:02:34.810> unfriendly

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 
that they're very sort of eco unfriendly

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:37.350 
that they're very sort of eco unfriendly
really<00:02:35.709> because<00:02:36.040> if<00:02:36.250> you<00:02:36.370> if<00:02:36.790> the<00:02:36.910> whole<00:02:37.060> idea

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
really because if you if the whole idea

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.390 
really because if you if the whole idea
is<00:02:37.390> to<00:02:37.569> keep<00:02:37.690> them<00:02:37.900> warm<00:02:38.080> all<00:02:38.319> the<00:02:38.620> time<00:02:38.830> that's

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
is to keep them warm all the time that's

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.160 
is to keep them warm all the time that's
a<00:02:39.519> lot<00:02:39.640> of<00:02:39.670> wasted<00:02:40.090> energy<00:02:40.180> well<00:02:40.870> it's<00:02:40.989> very

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
a lot of wasted energy well it's very

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:42.630 
a lot of wasted energy well it's very
important<00:02:41.709> again<00:02:41.920> that<00:02:42.129> there<00:02:42.250> are<00:02:42.370> different

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
important again that there are different

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.490 
important again that there are different
types<00:02:42.670> of<00:02:43.000> quality<00:02:43.420> hot<00:02:43.599> tubs<00:02:43.840> on<00:02:43.989> the<00:02:44.080> market

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
types of quality hot tubs on the market

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.080 
types of quality hot tubs on the market
is<00:02:44.709> very<00:02:44.950> importantly<00:02:45.519> you<00:02:45.640> look<00:02:45.790> for<00:02:45.940> good

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
is very importantly you look for good

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:48.030 
is very importantly you look for good
insulation<00:02:46.510> if<00:02:47.260> they're<00:02:47.470> well<00:02:47.620> insulated

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
insulation if they're well insulated

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.160 
insulation if they're well insulated
they<00:02:48.430> should<00:02:48.670> hold<00:02:48.910> the<00:02:49.030> heat<00:02:49.239> in<00:02:49.450> not<00:02:49.989> only

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
they should hold the heat in not only

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:51.720 
they should hold the heat in not only
when<00:02:50.410> the<00:02:50.500> lid<00:02:50.650> is<00:02:50.680> up<00:02:50.920> and<00:02:51.099> you're<00:02:51.190> using<00:02:51.489> them
