 young college students from the race 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:21.390

 what is this pulp and that 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:43.769
 then I was given the idea of ​​some 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:45.959
 processes try to direct them to what 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:47.700
 is to add value to more than

 aspirations that they hold together 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:03.170
 is to increase the level of production 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:05.280
 and in the not too distant future 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:08.160
 market their products in the
