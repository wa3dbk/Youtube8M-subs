00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.450 

up<00:02:01.930> a<00:02:02.050> little<00:02:02.290> bit

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:03.460 
up a little bit

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:08.190 
up a little bit
playa<00:02:04.680> wait<00:02:05.680> life<00:02:05.979> and<00:02:06.810> this

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.200 
playa wait life and this

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.230 
playa wait life and this
tilted<00:02:08.709> up<00:02:08.830> a<00:02:08.860> bit<00:02:09.160> so<00:02:09.369> you<00:02:09.520> can<00:02:09.580> see

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:11.240 
tilted up a bit so you can see

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:20.050 
tilted up a bit so you can see
just<00:02:11.900> here<00:02:12.230> i<00:02:12.730> have<00:02:14.440> a1<00:02:16.660> 20.3<00:02:17.860> read<00:02:19.060> by

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
just here i have a1 20.3 read by

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:26.140 
just here i have a1 20.3 read by
furniture<00:02:20.840> and<00:02:21.550> there's<00:02:23.380> about<00:02:24.490> five<00:02:25.490> fans<00:02:25.880> on

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
furniture and there's about five fans on

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.960 
furniture and there's about five fans on
it<00:02:26.270> so<00:02:26.630> that's<00:02:26.930> extreme<00:02:27.590> extreme<00:02:28.430> cooling

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
it so that's extreme extreme cooling

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:34.500 
it so that's extreme extreme cooling
going<00:02:29.360> on<00:02:30.880> okay

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:38.670 

so<00:02:35.110> as<00:02:35.349> you<00:02:35.530> can<00:02:35.709> see<00:02:36.840> this<00:02:37.840> is<00:02:38.049> quite<00:02:38.439> an

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
so as you can see this is quite an

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:43.679 
so as you can see this is quite an
impressive<00:02:39.549> system<00:02:40.180> and<00:02:42.480> it's<00:02:43.480> actually

00:02:43.679 --> 00:02:43.689 
impressive system and it's actually

00:02:43.689 --> 00:02:51.589 
impressive system and it's actually
housed<00:02:44.140> in<00:02:44.500> a<00:02:45.689> cooler<00:02:46.689> master<00:02:47.319> cosmos<00:02:47.590> s<00:02:48.329> case

00:02:51.589 --> 00:02:51.599 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:53.899 

let's<00:02:52.599> have<00:02:52.810> a<00:02:52.840> look<00:02:53.019> at<00:02:53.140> the<00:02:53.230> front<00:02:53.500> of<00:02:53.620> it

00:02:53.899 --> 00:02:53.909 
let's have a look at the front of it

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:59.430 
let's have a look at the front of it
okay<00:02:55.140> so<00:02:56.140> up<00:02:56.739> here<00:02:57.840> okay<00:02:58.840> let<00:02:59.019> it<00:02:59.170> stabilize

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 
okay so up here okay let it stabilize

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.300 
okay so up here okay let it stabilize
know<00:02:59.950> we<00:03:00.670> have<00:03:00.940> the<00:03:01.870> fan<00:03:02.109> controller<00:03:02.620> then

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 
know we have the fan controller then

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:06.440 
know we have the fan controller then
