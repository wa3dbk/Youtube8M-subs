00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
realize that if I were moved if I was

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:27.810 
realize that if I were moved if I was
moving<00:03:26.140> wall<00:03:26.530> during<00:03:26.739> the<00:03:26.830> speed<00:03:27.100> up<00:03:27.250> video<00:03:27.519> or

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:27.820 
moving wall during the speed up video or

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:30.479 
moving wall during the speed up video or
sped<00:03:28.150> up<00:03:28.269> video<00:03:28.540> then<00:03:28.989> it<00:03:29.200> will<00:03:29.320> look<00:03:29.590> as<00:03:29.800> bad

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:30.489 
sped up video then it will look as bad

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:39.780 
everybody handles different things
differently<00:03:37.660> like<00:03:38.320> how<00:03:38.860> a<00:03:38.890> person<00:03:39.340> handles

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790 
differently like how a person handles

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:41.729 
differently like how a person handles
spicy<00:03:40.330> things<00:03:40.630> not<00:03:41.019> everyone<00:03:41.380> can<00:03:41.500> handle

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:41.739 
spicy things not everyone can handle

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:44.580 
spicy things not everyone can handle
spicy<00:03:42.220> so<00:03:43.030> it's<00:03:43.239> just<00:03:43.480> the<00:03:43.570> same<00:03:43.750> thing<00:03:43.810> not

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
spicy so it's just the same thing not

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:46.170 
spicy so it's just the same thing not
everyone<00:03:44.980> could<00:03:45.070> actually<00:03:45.250> handle<00:03:45.550> looking

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 
everyone could actually handle looking

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:48.660 
everyone could actually handle looking
at<00:03:46.360> the<00:03:47.080> speed<00:03:47.440> of<00:03:47.620> a<00:03:47.709> video<00:03:47.890> going<00:03:48.310> back<00:03:48.430> four

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:48.670 
at the speed of a video going back four

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:50.460 
at the speed of a video going back four
thousand<00:03:49.000> percent<00:03:49.330> so<00:03:49.570> I<00:03:49.600> do<00:03:49.720> apologize<00:03:50.440> for

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:50.470 
thousand percent so I do apologize for

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:53.040 
thousand percent so I do apologize for
that<00:03:50.769> so<00:03:51.280> I<00:03:51.310> now<00:03:51.580> know<00:03:51.850> not<00:03:52.090> to<00:03:52.239> do<00:03:52.660> something

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:53.050 
that so I now know not to do something

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:54.690 
that so I now know not to do something
like<00:03:53.140> that<00:03:53.200> unless<00:03:53.709> if<00:03:54.040> I<00:03:54.130> was<00:03:54.519> actually

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:54.700 
like that unless if I was actually

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:57.600 
like that unless if I was actually
standing<00:03:55.150> perfectly<00:03:55.510> still<00:03:55.920> because<00:03:56.920> again<00:03:57.459> I

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:57.610 
standing perfectly still because again I

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:59.610 
standing perfectly still because again I
was<00:03:57.880> moving<00:03:58.239> while<00:03:58.630> the<00:03:58.840> video<00:03:59.320> was<00:03:59.440> being

00:03:59.610 --> 00:03:59.620 
was moving while the video was being

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:02.040 
was moving while the video was being
sped<00:03:59.920> up<00:04:00.160> so<00:04:00.310> that's<00:04:00.430> where<00:04:00.670> a<00:04:01.060> lot<00:04:01.600> of<00:04:01.840> eye

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:02.050 
sped up so that's where a lot of eye

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:04.340 
sped up so that's where a lot of eye
strain<00:04:02.560> or<00:04:02.830> a<00:04:02.860> lot<00:04:03.100> of<00:04:03.250> discomfort<00:04:03.640> was

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:04.350 
strain or a lot of discomfort was

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:06.360 
strain or a lot of discomfort was
happening<00:04:05.350> so<00:04:05.830> if<00:04:05.920> I<00:04:06.010> were<00:04:06.100> to<00:04:06.130> stand

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:06.370 
happening so if I were to stand

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:08.280 
happening so if I were to stand
perfectly<00:04:06.610> still<00:04:06.850> and<00:04:07.330> look<00:04:07.600> at<00:04:07.780> like<00:04:07.959> a<00:04:07.989> wall

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:08.290 
perfectly still and look at like a wall

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:10.830 
perfectly still and look at like a wall
being<00:04:08.530> built<00:04:08.590> that<00:04:09.580> probably<00:04:10.239> would<00:04:10.480> be<00:04:10.510> best

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:10.840 
being built that probably would be best

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:12.570 
being built that probably would be best
at<00:04:11.170> four<00:04:11.560> thousand<00:04:11.860> percent<00:04:12.130> depending<00:04:12.340> on

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:12.580 
at four thousand percent depending on

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:14.580 
at four thousand percent depending on
how<00:04:12.670> long<00:04:12.880> it<00:04:13.030> takes<00:04:13.060> for<00:04:13.450> it<00:04:13.570> to<00:04:13.600> be<00:04:13.780> made<00:04:14.019> so

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:14.590 
how long it takes for it to be made so

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:16.080 
how long it takes for it to be made so
something<00:04:15.010> like<00:04:15.040> that<00:04:15.190> I<00:04:15.400> would<00:04:15.700> have<00:04:15.790> to<00:04:15.880> be

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:16.090 
something like that I would have to be

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:19.349 
something like that I would have to be
doing<00:04:16.479> but<00:04:16.930> since<00:04:17.049> I<00:04:17.169> was<00:04:17.290> moving<00:04:17.500> I<00:04:18.359> apologize

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:19.359

I want to see how long it would take me

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:31.290 
I want to see how long it would take me
to<00:04:29.620> do<00:04:29.770> this<00:04:29.980> while<00:04:30.250> all<00:04:30.580> my<00:04:30.640> other<00:04:31.120> friends

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:31.300 
to do this while all my other friends

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:32.790 
to do this while all my other friends
were<00:04:31.540> working<00:04:31.810> out<00:04:31.930> the<00:04:32.050> tunnel<00:04:32.230> so<00:04:32.440> we<00:04:32.530> get

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:32.800 
were working out the tunnel so we get

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:34.830 
were working out the tunnel so we get
more<00:04:33.040> things<00:04:33.310> done<00:04:33.400> at<00:04:33.730> once<00:04:33.970> so<00:04:34.570> that<00:04:34.600> they

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:34.840 
more things done at once so that they

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:36.090 
more things done at once so that they
didn't<00:04:34.990> have<00:04:35.080> to<00:04:35.170> focus<00:04:35.380> on<00:04:35.680> trying<00:04:35.830> to<00:04:35.950> help

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:36.100 
didn't have to focus on trying to help

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:37.920 
didn't have to focus on trying to help
me<00:04:36.250> out<00:04:36.280> the<00:04:36.880> only<00:04:37.090> time<00:04:37.270> we're<00:04:37.420> actually<00:04:37.540> have

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:37.930 
me out the only time we're actually have

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:40.440 
me out the only time we're actually have
helped<00:04:38.350> me<00:04:38.440> out<00:04:38.470> it's<00:04:38.830> when<00:04:39.430> I<00:04:39.730> asked<00:04:40.240> him<00:04:40.300> to

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:40.450 
helped me out it's when I asked him to

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:42.450 
helped me out it's when I asked him to
destroy<00:04:40.780> the<00:04:41.290> ice<00:04:41.470> in<00:04:41.710> front<00:04:41.830> of<00:04:41.980> me<00:04:42.070> so<00:04:42.250> that<00:04:42.430> I

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:42.460 
destroy the ice in front of me so that I

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:44.610 
destroy the ice in front of me so that I
could<00:04:42.580> actually<00:04:42.820> get<00:04:43.510> done<00:04:43.570> with<00:04:44.200> placing

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:44.620 
could actually get done with placing

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:46.920 
could actually get done with placing
down<00:04:44.740> blocks<00:04:45.010> faster<00:04:45.490> as<00:04:45.730> of<00:04:46.030> course<00:04:46.600> the<00:04:46.810> ice

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:46.930 
down blocks faster as of course the ice

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:48.840 
down blocks faster as of course the ice
will<00:04:47.110> keep<00:04:47.260> spawning<00:04:47.530> and<00:04:47.860> they<00:04:48.490> will<00:04:48.610> get<00:04:48.700> in

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:48.850 
will keep spawning and they will get in

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:52.170 
will keep spawning and they will get in
the<00:04:48.940> way<00:04:49.500> all<00:04:50.500> right<00:04:50.860> and<00:04:51.220> also<00:04:51.850> a<00:04:51.970> little<00:04:52.030> bit

doing speed up videos like this it's
going<00:04:55.780> to<00:04:55.840> look<00:04:55.990> glitchy<00:04:56.260> but<00:04:56.650> don't<00:04:56.800> worry

here we are skylight number two we're
almost<00:05:08.320> done<00:05:08.830> and<00:05:09.130> said<00:05:09.970> the<00:05:10.630> sad<00:05:10.900> part<00:05:10.930> is

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:14.860 
skylight number two is one layer higher

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:17.400 
skylight number two is one layer higher
than<00:05:15.160> every<00:05:15.580> other<00:05:15.610> skylight<00:05:16.260> meaning<00:05:17.260> that

than every other skylight meaning that
Scylla<00:05:18.250> three<00:05:18.730> four<00:05:19.180> and<00:05:19.210> five<00:05:19.570> they<00:05:19.870> were

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:19.930 
Scylla three four and five they were

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:22.860 
Scylla three four and five they were
created<00:05:20.470> on<00:05:20.590> y-axis<00:05:20.920> 65<00:05:21.880> while<00:05:22.360> skylight

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:22.870 
created on y-axis 65 while skylight

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:26.730 
created on y-axis 65 while skylight
number<00:05:23.110> four<00:05:23.410> was<00:05:23.890> created<00:05:24.340> on<00:05:24.520> y-axis<00:05:24.990> 66<00:05:25.990> so

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:26.740 
number four was created on y-axis 66 so

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:29.310 
number four was created on y-axis 66 so
for<00:05:27.130> a<00:05:27.160> part<00:05:27.520> of<00:05:27.670> this<00:05:27.910> small<00:05:28.210> series<00:05:28.480> is<00:05:28.780> that

to see so I am done I am done placing

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:54.810 
to see so I am done I am done placing
down<00:05:52.870> all<00:05:53.110> the<00:05:53.290> blocks<00:05:53.560> for<00:05:53.860> this<00:05:54.010> part<00:05:54.460> and<00:05:54.760> I

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:54.820 
down all the blocks for this part and I

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:57.750 
down all the blocks for this part and I
believe<00:05:55.060> it<00:05:55.180> took<00:05:55.270> me<00:05:55.330> around<00:05:56.580> 5150<00:05:57.580> two

00:05:57.750 --> 00:05:57.760 
believe it took me around 5150 two

00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:59.730 
believe it took me around 5150 two
blocks<00:05:58.150> I'm<00:05:58.390> not<00:05:58.660> too<00:05:58.930> sure<00:05:59.230> exactly<00:05:59.650> but

00:05:59.730 --> 00:05:59.740 
blocks I'm not too sure exactly but

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:02.340 
blocks I'm not too sure exactly but
let's<00:06:00.010> just<00:06:00.070> say<00:06:00.250> six<00:06:00.640> thousand<00:06:01.030> blocks<00:06:01.350> for

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:02.350 
let's just say six thousand blocks for

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:03.840 
let's just say six thousand blocks for
one<00:06:02.590> side<00:06:02.830> of<00:06:02.890> the<00:06:02.950> world<00:06:03.130> so<00:06:03.520> it's<00:06:03.640> gonna<00:06:03.760> take

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:03.850 
one side of the world so it's gonna take

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:05.820 
one side of the world so it's gonna take
an<00:06:04.060> average<00:06:04.210> of<00:06:04.570> six<00:06:04.900> thousand<00:06:05.380> blocks<00:06:05.590> for

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:05.830 
an average of six thousand blocks for

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:07.860 
an average of six thousand blocks for
every<00:06:06.160> other<00:06:06.280> word<00:06:06.550> or<00:06:06.670> yeah<00:06:07.300> for<00:06:07.540> every<00:06:07.720> other

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:10.270 
side of the world but that is it for

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:12.630 
side of the world but that is it for
