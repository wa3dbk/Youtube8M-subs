00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 Another day in a debate, a father 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.600
 asked the teacher what the 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.240
 family can do to help the school 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.920
 in the education of our children and I said 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.290
 look at an invention in its management 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.570
 It's not the family that helps the school in 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.250
 education of their children is the 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.380
 the school that helps his family in 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.699
 education of their children by 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.090
 schooling 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:26.340
 you have a two eels have children 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.689
 24 hours a day and wait until the 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.539
 end of your life 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.279
 we have 30 40 in a classroom 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.700
 for four hours 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:37.920
 if you suppose that containing only two ne 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.530
 you have a hard time making 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.290
 imagine if we are with a set of 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.899
 children we could have replaced that 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.969
 the task of the family so as well as 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.430
 today has the personal trainer 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.050
 just as I have personal stylist for 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.000
 help people get dressed 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.289
 some think they have personal fado and 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.360
 personal almada 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.910
 this is people who replace father and mother 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.309
 even does not appear in the education of the children 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.290
 family is in the first place and the 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.710
 public power of secondary form 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.600
 the school does schooling so if the 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.970
 family does not fulfill what it 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.920
 need to attend school will not give an account 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.450
 and it's no use giving 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.700
 Of course it's no use in school either. 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.100
 tell me what I can do, I have to do 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.350
 partnership with families in order to 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.750
 also inform the parents that a 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.229
 The parents are lost, she does not know 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.659
 has 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.549
 she is in a situation of submission with 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.200
 the children of 20 banal 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.420
 in fact I said that today a comment 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:37.170
 on the radio live in SÃ£o Paulo by 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.369
 Phone picture when you were a girl 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.110
 I do not want to talk about the past. 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.850
 to go back to it but there are some 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.490
 references as a boy I 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:47.640
 I arrived at the restaurant, not with my father. 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:51.720
 And the mother, my father says so, I felt 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:53.310
 that sentence I sat down to speak of 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:57.060
 today father 's day 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:59.399
 where you want to sit, what you want 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:02.070
 eating is that sometimes the choice for the 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:05.130
 end this is you offer a child of 8 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:08.399
 9 years in the name of a caring something that is 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:10.920
 to educate it is obvious that I am 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.780
 otherwise beat to beat but not 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.660
 I am in no way opposed to a 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.470
 education that is 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:19.990
 I never hit my children in them but 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:22.930
 Every time I was firm, I was firm. 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:25.120
 beaten and know how to say no, no, the speech is 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:29.590
 authority is to put your hand on your shoulder 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:32.470
 gently but firmly the child 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:33.550
 feel the pressure without hurting but felt 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:36.100
 the pressure 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:38.410
 this means that it may seem 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:41.080
 but there is a significant difference 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:43.540
 formation of a character of a child of 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:47.760
 10 years old for example I say the 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:50.740
 she feels and tell her where she wants to sit 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:53.110
 just the way I say the second sentence 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:56.440
 who seems affectionate she is not affectionate 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:58.750
 She is cowed where she wants to sit. 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:01.270
 Do you want to eat? Do not you want to study for? 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:02.590
 example, the result knows that it is 

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:04.420
 consequence 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.830
 Some of these children are trained in 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:08.530
 families that do not have authority over 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:12.160
 she the child sleeps at the time she wants 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:14.380
 as she wishes she leaves she heard a child 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:16.630
 that she wants the radio whatever it is 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:19.900
 where it will find an obstacle to 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:21.730
 this lack of limit in school when 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:24.450
 she enters the classroom we talk 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:27.640
 so each material did the task 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:29.920
 chain of guard that phone throws away 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:30.970
 chewing gum knows they are part of 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:33.520
 on top of us 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:35.410
 we've never had so many cases of 

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:36.940
 violence by students against teachers 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:39.390
 while we will naturally have 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:42.520
 because what we are the first adult 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:45.220
 in the day-to-day life of some children 

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:47.400
 He decided to carry it on the authority 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:49.989
 authority is not authoritarianism 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:54.390
 command authority and responsibility 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:54.390
 this authority has to be exercised
