00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:00.690 
watch TV and notice how the programming

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:02.330 
watch TV and notice how the programming
is<00:05:00.840> pushing<00:05:01.199> the<00:05:01.349> notion<00:05:01.710> that<00:05:01.740> people<00:05:01.889> will

and<00:05:59.880> the<00:06:00.210> last<00:06:00.360> thing<00:06:00.950> microwave<00:06:01.950> radiation

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:02.340 
and the last thing microwave radiation

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:07.160 
and the last thing microwave radiation
is<00:06:02.760> constant<00:06:03.300> 2.7<00:06:04.110> around<00:06:04.830> the<00:06:05.040> earth<00:06:05.190> and<00:06:06.170> yet

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:07.170 
is constant 2.7 around the earth and yet

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:08.990 
is constant 2.7 around the earth and yet
the<00:06:07.530> Earth<00:06:07.680> revolves<00:06:08.130> it<00:06:08.460> would<00:06:08.610> be<00:06:08.760> different

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:09.000 
the Earth revolves it would be different

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.150 
the Earth revolves it would be different
due<00:06:09.360> to<00:06:09.570> dopplers<00:06:09.960> effect<00:06:10.140> just<00:06:10.830> one<00:06:10.980> more

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:11.160 
due to dopplers effect just one more
