00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.760
 that for natal yes good things 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.859

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.510
 we are no longer friends as before but 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.760
 I would like at least to be able to speak 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.990
 sometimes what happens is not 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.000
 why did you come to speak with his 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.230
 cat eyes beaten so maybe because 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.810
 that your little sister is gone that you have 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.859
 afraid to be found alone I like that 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.590
 when it's fear that speak yet 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.340

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.050
 when the nest will go to 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:44.879

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:47.309

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.590
 your faithful servant would have liked to say 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.489
 a few words but before anything 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.489

00:00:56.949 --> 00:01:02.739

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.619
 to him too much whenever he 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.670

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.200
 it all began the day your sister was 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.430

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.420
