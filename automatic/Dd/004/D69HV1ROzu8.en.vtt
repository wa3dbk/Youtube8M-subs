this<00:01:07.270> all<00:01:07.450> blonde<00:01:07.810> so<00:01:08.910> sorry

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.480 

let<00:01:18.660> me<00:01:18.750> say<00:01:18.960> you<00:01:19.020> can<00:01:19.260> see

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:29.440 

pretty<00:01:24.330> crazy<00:01:24.570> been<00:01:25.130> that<00:01:26.130> they<00:01:26.280> had<00:01:26.460> to<00:01:26.580> do

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:29.450 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:34.940 

but<00:01:30.450> I<00:01:31.820> think<00:01:32.820> I<00:01:33.150> think<00:01:33.510> it<00:01:33.840> added<00:01:34.020> to<00:01:34.230> add<00:01:34.710> it

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
but I think I think it added to add it

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.320 
but I think I think it added to add it
to<00:01:35.100> the<00:01:35.220> horsepower<00:01:35.610> the<00:01:35.670> guy<00:01:35.940> was<00:01:36.090> saying

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:36.330 
to the horsepower the guy was saying

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:41.500 
to the horsepower the guy was saying
that<00:01:36.479> he<00:01:36.570> can<00:01:36.750> actually<00:01:36.900> build<00:01:37.910> this<00:01:38.910> to<00:01:39.180> where

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:41.510 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:44.719 

you<00:01:42.510> can<00:01:42.660> have<00:01:42.900> that<00:01:43.110> exactly<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:44.220> header<00:01:44.460> so

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
you can have that exactly the header so

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.160 
you can have that exactly the header so
you<00:01:44.820> can<00:01:44.910> cut<00:01:45.090> off<00:01:45.180> each<00:01:45.390> one<00:01:45.600> of<00:01:45.690> those<00:01:45.840> and

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
you can cut off each one of those and

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.040 
you can cut off each one of those and
then<00:01:46.800> actually<00:01:47.160> have<00:01:47.340> it<00:01:47.490> flow<00:01:47.729> into<00:01:47.940> a<00:01:48.420> header

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:49.050 
then actually have it flow into a header

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:55.460 
then actually have it flow into a header
collector<00:01:49.700> here<00:01:50.700> and<00:01:52.670> actually<00:01:53.670> be<00:01:53.850> a<00:01:54.470> true

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
collector here and actually be a true

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.640 
collector here and actually be a true
exhaust<00:01:55.920> like<00:01:56.460> that<00:01:57.200> because<00:01:58.200> he<00:01:58.320> said<00:01:58.500> it

00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:58.650 
exhaust like that because he said it

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:03.410 
exhaust like that because he said it
choked<00:01:58.860> it<00:01:59.009> down<00:01:59.190> quite<00:01:59.520> a<00:01:59.580> bit<00:02:00.440> but<00:02:01.440> uh<00:02:02.420> anyway

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
choked it down quite a bit but uh anyway

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.490 
choked it down quite a bit but uh anyway
so<00:02:04.430> there's<00:02:05.430> a<00:02:05.550> conclusion<00:02:06.200> hope<00:02:07.200> you<00:02:07.350> guys

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
so there's a conclusion hope you guys

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.750 
so there's a conclusion hope you guys
