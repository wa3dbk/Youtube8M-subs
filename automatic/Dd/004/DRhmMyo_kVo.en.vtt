trying<00:01:16.880> to<00:01:16.939> think<00:01:17.090> of<00:01:17.149> how<00:01:17.240> I<00:01:17.270> can<00:01:19.659> nope

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:22.750 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:31.809

vamos oh my god ah this again this
happened<00:01:32.149> last<00:01:32.299> round<00:01:32.630> also<00:01:32.810> I<00:01:33.110> don't<00:01:33.259> know

00:01:33.309 --> 00:01:33.319 
happened last round also I don't know

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:35.260

why<00:01:33.500> people<00:01:33.530> signing<00:01:34.399> the<00:01:34.579> games<00:01:34.819> just<00:01:35.000> to

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.270 
why people signing the games just to

00:01:35.270 --> 00:02:01.029 
why people signing the games just to
stand<00:01:35.509> there<00:01:59.649> so<00:02:00.649> I<00:02:00.679> mean<00:02:00.799> the<00:02:00.890> whole<00:02:00.950> thing

00:02:01.029 --> 00:02:01.039 
stand there so I mean the whole thing

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:04.029 
stand there so I mean the whole thing
with<00:02:01.340> like<00:02:02.200> jumping<00:02:03.200> is<00:02:03.379> that<00:02:03.619> I<00:02:03.649> think<00:02:03.770> it

00:02:04.029 --> 00:02:04.039 
with like jumping is that I think it

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:06.880 
with like jumping is that I think it
though<00:02:04.189> I<00:02:04.450> the<00:02:05.450> shot<00:02:05.719> goes<00:02:05.899> up<00:02:06.170> or<00:02:06.649> it<00:02:06.709> could<00:02:06.829> be

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 
though I the shot goes up or it could be

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.369 
though I the shot goes up or it could be
just<00:02:07.069> where<00:02:07.219> the<00:02:07.479> the<00:02:08.479> barrel<00:02:08.840> of<00:02:08.929> the<00:02:09.019> gun<00:02:09.049> is

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:09.379 
just where the the barrel of the gun is

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:11.589 
just where the the barrel of the gun is
when<00:02:09.500> I<00:02:09.560> pull<00:02:09.739> the<00:02:09.829> trigger<00:02:10.390> so<00:02:11.390> I<00:02:11.420> think

00:02:11.589 --> 00:02:11.599 
when I pull the trigger so I think

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:14.369 
when I pull the trigger so I think
figuring<00:02:12.019> that<00:02:12.170> that's<00:02:12.500> gonna<00:02:12.680> be<00:02:12.769> key

00:02:14.369 --> 00:02:14.379 
figuring that that's gonna be key

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:17.970 
figuring that that's gonna be key
someone<00:02:15.379> just<00:02:15.470> grabbed<00:02:15.650> the<00:02:15.799> damnit
