all the guards first before I go over
pottsy<00:00:40.770> which<00:00:40.920> i<00:00:41.040> think<00:00:41.460> it's<00:00:41.610> pretty<00:00:41.760> much

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
pottsy which i think it's pretty much

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.510 
pottsy which i think it's pretty much
you<00:00:42.149> need<00:00:42.329> to<00:00:42.480> do<00:00:42.660> and<00:00:42.899> make<00:00:43.800> sure<00:00:43.980> you<00:00:44.190> keep<00:00:44.370> an

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
you need to do and make sure you keep an

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.580 
you need to do and make sure you keep an
eye<00:00:44.670> on<00:00:44.820> your<00:00:44.940> health<00:00:45.180> and<00:00:45.390> make<00:00:45.600> sure<00:00:45.750> if<00:00:46.379> it

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
eye on your health and make sure if it

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.440 
eye on your health and make sure if it
gets<00:00:46.800> too<00:00:46.950> low<00:00:47.129> then<00:00:47.520> you<00:00:47.550> use<00:00:47.879> your<00:00:47.910> medicine

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
gets too low then you use your medicine

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.090 
gets too low then you use your medicine
because<00:00:48.750> you<00:00:48.930> definitely<00:00:49.320> don't<00:00:49.770> want<00:00:50.010> to

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
because you definitely don't want to

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.860 
because you definitely don't want to
fail<00:00:50.280> it<00:00:50.460> right<00:00:50.640> now<00:00:50.820> now<00:00:51.300> that<00:00:51.480> you're<00:00:51.629> at<00:00:51.719> the

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
fail it right now now that you're at the

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.459 
fail it right now now that you're at the
end<00:00:52.340> so<00:00:53.340> I<00:00:53.370> use<00:00:53.850> a<00:00:53.879> counters<00:00:54.690> to<00:00:54.899> kill<00:00:55.140> and<00:00:55.440> you

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
end so I use a counters to kill and you

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.770 
end so I use a counters to kill and you
know<00:00:56.430> if<00:00:56.550> they're<00:00:56.730> not<00:00:56.850> attacking<00:00:57.180> me<00:00:57.449> then<00:00:57.690> I

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780
