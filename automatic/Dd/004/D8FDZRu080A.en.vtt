00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:37.470 
have clarification I noticed last couple
of<00:02:35.380> food<00:02:35.560> vlogs<00:02:35.860> that<00:02:36.130> I've<00:02:36.490> watched<00:02:36.760> you<00:02:37.450> know

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
of food vlogs that I've watched you know

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.150 
of food vlogs that I've watched you know
cuz<00:02:37.750> we<00:02:37.840> tell<00:02:38.080> them<00:02:38.200> that<00:02:38.260> i<00:02:38.440> rewatch<00:02:38.920> him

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
cuz we tell them that i rewatch him

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.910 
cuz we tell them that i rewatch him
that's<00:02:39.760> good<00:02:40.060> yeah<00:02:40.390> so<00:02:41.200> I<00:02:41.230> think<00:02:41.650> there's<00:02:41.800> the

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
that's good yeah so I think there's the

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.620 
that's good yeah so I think there's the
confusion<00:02:42.370> out<00:02:42.430> there<00:02:42.700> between<00:02:42.910> barbecuing

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:43.630 
confusion out there between barbecuing

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:47.780

and<00:02:43.720> smoking<00:02:44.260> our<00:02:44.880> grill<00:02:45.880> that<00:02:46.300> we<00:02:46.360> have<00:02:46.720> is<00:02:47.200> a

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
and smoking our grill that we have is a

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:52.949 
and smoking our grill that we have is a
