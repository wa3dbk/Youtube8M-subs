00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
wanted a little bit more detailed

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.959 
wanted a little bit more detailed
instruction<00:01:46.200> on<00:01:46.380> it<00:01:46.530> which<00:01:46.740> we<00:01:47.189> did<00:01:47.429> or<00:01:47.759> well

00:01:47.959 --> 00:01:47.969 
instruction on it which we did or well

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:50.060 
instruction on it which we did or well
so<00:01:48.270> I<00:01:48.329> put<00:01:48.509> together<00:01:48.630> the<00:01:49.320> tablature<00:01:49.679> to<00:01:49.920> it

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
so I put together the tablature to it

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.849 
so I put together the tablature to it
and<00:01:50.240> broke<00:01:51.240> him<00:01:51.420> down<00:01:51.539> breaking<00:01:51.960> down<00:01:52.259> the

00:01:52.849 --> 00:01:52.859 
and broke him down breaking down the

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:54.859 
and broke him down breaking down the
finger<00:01:53.100> picking<00:01:53.280> pattern<00:01:53.700> so<00:01:54.210> again<00:01:54.689> it's

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
finger picking pattern so again it's

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
comes out with a little bit of

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.809 
comes out with a little bit of
variations<00:02:16.170> all<00:02:16.410> the<00:02:16.590> time<00:02:16.800> so<00:02:17.340> we<00:02:17.580> go<00:02:17.700> into

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 
variations all the time so we go into

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:20.210

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
but the picking pattern is kind of the

but the picking pattern is kind of the
crucial<00:02:23.130> thing<00:02:23.250> to<00:02:23.280> this<00:02:23.490> song<00:02:23.700> and<00:02:23.970> it's<00:02:24.750> what
