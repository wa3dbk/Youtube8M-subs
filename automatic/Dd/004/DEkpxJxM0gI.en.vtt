option so we're really excited to be
participating<00:02:24.510> in<00:02:25.140> this<00:02:25.230> and<00:02:25.440> starting<00:02:25.860> it

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
participating in this and starting it

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.550 
participating in this and starting it
and<00:02:26.250> can't<00:02:26.730> wait<00:02:26.820> to<00:02:26.880> get<00:02:27.090> started<00:02:27.210> the<00:02:28.050> yarns

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
and can't wait to get started the yarns

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.260 
and can't wait to get started the yarns
that<00:02:28.710> are<00:02:28.830> used<00:02:29.130> in<00:02:29.400> this<00:02:29.580> are<00:02:29.820> sock<00:02:30.060> weight

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
that are used in this are sock weight

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:33.020 
that are used in this are sock weight
yarns<00:02:30.780> and<00:02:31.040> so<00:02:32.040> they<00:02:32.160> use<00:02:32.340> the<00:02:32.490> size<00:02:32.700> we're

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
yarns and so they use the size we're

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:34.840 
yarns and so they use the size we're
going<00:02:33.060> to<00:02:33.210> be<00:02:33.270> using<00:02:33.390> a<00:02:33.570> size<00:02:33.720> 2<00:02:34.020> needle<00:02:34.410> and

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:34.850 
going to be using a size 2 needle and

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:39.650 
going to be using a size 2 needle and
you<00:02:35.850> can<00:02:36.030> see<00:02:36.240> that<00:02:38.030> they<00:02:39.030> don't<00:02:39.240> have<00:02:39.390> to<00:02:39.540> look

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
you can see that they don't have to look

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.600 
you can see that they don't have to look
the<00:02:39.810> same<00:02:39.990> they're<00:02:40.440> all<00:02:40.470> very<00:02:40.980> different<00:02:41.130> from

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
the same they're all very different from

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:42.920 
the same they're all very different from
each<00:02:41.730> other

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
each other

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.140 
each other
scraps<00:02:43.440> work<00:02:43.800> it<00:02:43.980> takes<00:02:44.100> about<00:02:44.310> 30<00:02:44.640> yards<00:02:44.910> to

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
scraps work it takes about 30 yards to

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.870 
scraps work it takes about 30 yards to
make<00:02:45.390> one<00:02:45.600> of<00:02:45.720> the<00:02:45.780> squares<00:02:46.080> and<00:02:46.520> we<00:02:47.520> just<00:02:47.730> have

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
make one of the squares and we just have

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.610 
make one of the squares and we just have
a<00:02:47.910> mishmash<00:02:48.240> of<00:02:48.540> yarns<00:02:48.900> and<00:02:49.080> we're<00:02:49.230> putting<00:02:49.530> it

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
a mishmash of yarns and we're putting it

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.530 
a mishmash of yarns and we're putting it
all<00:02:49.740> together<00:02:49.890> into<00:02:50.370> a<00:02:50.520> mishmash<00:02:50.820> of<00:02:51.270> little

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
all together into a mishmash of little

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.690 
all together into a mishmash of little
squares<00:02:51.810> and<00:02:52.260> probably<00:02:53.190> you<00:02:53.310> put<00:02:53.520> it<00:02:53.610> all

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
squares and probably you put it all

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.520 
squares and probably you put it all
together<00:02:53.820> it's<00:02:54.300> like<00:02:54.390> a<00:02:54.510> quilt<00:02:54.870> in<00:02:55.350> color

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
together it's like a quilt in color

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.890 
together it's like a quilt in color
right<00:02:55.800> the<00:02:56.220> eye<00:02:56.250> is<00:02:56.400> beautiful<00:02:57.180> the<00:02:57.510> eye<00:02:57.540> sort

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
right the eye is beautiful the eye sort

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.450 
right the eye is beautiful the eye sort
of<00:02:57.990> merge<00:02:58.140> I<00:02:58.380> used<00:02:58.650> to<00:02:58.770> tell<00:02:58.920> me<00:02:59.100> that<00:02:59.190> all<00:02:59.250> the

00:02:59.450 --> 00:02:59.460 
of merge I used to tell me that all the

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:00.800 
of merge I used to tell me that all the
time<00:02:59.490> the<00:02:59.790> I<00:02:59.820> will<00:03:00.180> blend<00:03:00.360> it<00:03:00.540> all<00:03:00.600> together

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
time the I will blend it all together

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.020 
time the I will blend it all together
and<00:03:01.260> in<00:03:01.380> fact<00:03:01.560> it<00:03:01.800> does<00:03:01.980> and<00:03:02.250> the<00:03:02.700> mitered

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
and in fact it does and the mitered

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.150 
and in fact it does and the mitered
squares<00:03:03.360> are<00:03:03.690> just<00:03:03.930> so<00:03:04.080> much<00:03:04.260> fun<00:03:04.470> to<00:03:04.620> do<00:03:04.770> we're

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
squares are just so much fun to do we're

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:06.920 
squares are just so much fun to do we're
going<00:03:05.190> to<00:03:05.400> have<00:03:05.550> four<00:03:05.790> pieces<00:03:06.030> to<00:03:06.360> the<00:03:06.480> to<00:03:06.840> the
