and

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
and

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.039 
and
now<00:02:21.310> I'm<00:02:21.670> not<00:02:21.730> sure<00:02:22.180> this<00:02:22.330> lab<00:02:22.599> maybe<00:02:22.810> some

00:02:23.039 --> 00:02:23.049 
now I'm not sure this lab maybe some

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:26.070 
now I'm not sure this lab maybe some
campaign<00:02:23.830> maybe<00:02:24.190> some<00:02:24.430> co-op<00:02:24.670> I<00:02:25.390> don't<00:02:26.019> think

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 
campaign maybe some co-op I don't think

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.380 
campaign maybe some co-op I don't think
so<00:02:26.290> i<00:02:26.409> think<00:02:26.440> it's<00:02:26.650> strictly<00:02:27.010> multiplayer<00:02:27.580> but

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
so i think it's strictly multiplayer but

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:31.350 
so i think it's strictly multiplayer but
they<00:02:28.540> said<00:02:28.780> winter<00:02:29.310> they<00:02:30.310> said<00:02:30.670> winter<00:02:31.090> for

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
the ps3 playstation 3 console the they

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:37.199 
the ps3 playstation 3 console the they
