this<00:01:59.909> team<00:02:00.210> looks<00:02:00.509> like<00:02:00.750> in<00:02:01.009> 2020<00:02:02.009> and<00:02:02.600> my

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
this team looks like in 2020 and my

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:04.969 
this team looks like in 2020 and my
goalkeeper<00:02:04.110> I<00:02:04.200> got<00:02:04.380> two<00:02:04.590> world-class

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
goalkeeper I got two world-class

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:08.240 
goalkeeper I got two world-class
goalkeepers<00:02:05.820> and<00:02:06.030> they<00:02:06.899> were<00:02:07.229> rotating<00:02:07.920> a<00:02:08.009> lot

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
goalkeepers and they were rotating a lot

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:09.740 
goalkeepers and they were rotating a lot
and<00:02:08.550> that's<00:02:08.759> the<00:02:08.940> only<00:02:09.119> way<00:02:09.239> I<00:02:09.270> can<00:02:09.450> get<00:02:09.599> those

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
and that's the only way I can get those

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.460 
and that's the only way I can get those
players<00:02:10.170> to<00:02:10.379> work<00:02:10.830> class

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
players to work class

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:13.610 
players to work class
well<00:02:11.650> I<00:02:11.710> got<00:02:11.920> to<00:02:12.010> do<00:02:12.130> a<00:02:12.160> lot<00:02:12.400> of<00:02:12.460> rotation<00:02:13.300> for

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
well I got to do a lot of rotation for

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.920 
well I got to do a lot of rotation for
example<00:02:14.620> every<00:02:15.610> three<00:02:16.090> games<00:02:16.330> I'll<00:02:16.570> switch

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
example every three games I'll switch

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.680 
example every three games I'll switch
with<00:02:17.170> another<00:02:17.380> goalkeeper<00:02:18.340> and<00:02:18.520> every<00:02:19.300> three

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
with another goalkeeper and every three

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.230 
with another goalkeeper and every three
games<00:02:19.900> out<00:02:20.110> switch<00:02:20.440> with<00:02:20.770> a<00:02:20.980> bench<00:02:21.250> player<00:02:21.490> in

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:22.240 
games out switch with a bench player in

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:24.360 
games out switch with a bench player in
the<00:02:22.750> outfield<00:02:22.800> position<00:02:23.800> and<00:02:24.010> that's<00:02:24.190> the

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
the outfield position and that's the

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:26.820 
the outfield position and that's the
reason<00:02:24.730> why<00:02:24.850> I<00:02:24.880> got<00:02:25.180> to<00:02:25.300> do<00:02:25.480> so<00:02:25.750> for<00:02:26.320> place<00:02:26.590> to

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
reason why I got to do so for place to

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:28.800 
reason why I got to do so for place to
head<00:02:26.980> their<00:02:27.130> potentials<00:02:27.730> in<00:02:27.880> time<00:02:28.150> and<00:02:28.570> you

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
head their potentials in time and you

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:30.570 
head their potentials in time and you
can<00:02:28.930> take<00:02:29.140> a<00:02:29.170> look<00:02:29.410> the<00:02:29.620> lowest<00:02:30.040> player<00:02:30.370> on

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
can take a look the lowest player on

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:33.840 
can take a look the lowest player on
this<00:02:30.760> team<00:02:30.820> is<00:02:31.300> about<00:02:31.720> at<00:02:32.050> 82<00:02:32.500> or<00:02:32.830> 83<00:02:32.860> overall

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:33.850 
this team is about at 82 or 83 overall

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:35.760 
this team is about at 82 or 83 overall
not<00:02:34.060> too<00:02:34.090> sure<00:02:34.450> who<00:02:34.660> that<00:02:34.690> player<00:02:35.170> raised<00:02:35.440> and

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:35.770 
not too sure who that player raised and

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:37.980 
not too sure who that player raised and
after<00:02:36.610> you<00:02:36.760> guys<00:02:36.910> take<00:02:37.270> a<00:02:37.300> look<00:02:37.510> at<00:02:37.630> the<00:02:37.750> place

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:37.990 
after you guys take a look at the place

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:40.830 
after you guys take a look at the place
that<00:02:38.020> stats<00:02:38.470> will<00:02:39.010> play<00:02:39.310> a<00:02:39.340> game<00:02:39.610> and<00:02:39.850> still

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
that stats will play a game and still

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.380 
that stats will play a game and still
gonna<00:02:41.260> be<00:02:41.440> playing<00:02:41.740> against<00:02:42.160> a<00:02:42.310> three<00:02:43.150> star

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
gonna be playing against a three star

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:45.510 
gonna be playing against a three star
team<00:02:43.720> or<00:02:44.020> even<00:02:44.140> less<00:02:44.530> than<00:02:44.560> that<00:02:44.800> so<00:02:45.310> it

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:45.520 
team or even less than that so it

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:46.920 
team or even less than that so it
shouldn't<00:02:45.790> really<00:02:46.000> be<00:02:46.150> too<00:02:46.510> much<00:02:46.690> of<00:02:46.840> a

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
shouldn't really be too much of a

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.650 
shouldn't really be too much of a
challenge<00:02:47.200> and<00:02:47.680> right<00:02:48.370> now<00:02:48.610> I've<00:02:49.240> only<00:02:49.360> got

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 
challenge and right now I've only got

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:52.080 
challenge and right now I've only got
like<00:02:49.840> maybe<00:02:50.410> three<00:02:50.920> players<00:02:51.280> with<00:02:51.610> at<00:02:51.850> least

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
like maybe three players with at least

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:54.750

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
between one star three star and it's

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.960 
between one star three star and it's
really<00:02:59.080> hard<00:02:59.260> to<00:02:59.380> find<00:02:59.530> plays<00:02:59.860> with<00:03:00.100> 4<00:03:00.640> stars

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
really hard to find plays with 4 stars

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:02.790 
really hard to find plays with 4 stars
skill<00:03:01.030> moves<00:03:01.270> in<00:03:01.630> FIFA<00:03:01.930> 14<00:03:02.170> because<00:03:02.530> they've

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:02.800 
skill moves in FIFA 14 because they've

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.160 
skill moves in FIFA 14 because they've
messed<00:03:03.040> up<00:03:03.310> a<00:03:03.430> lot<00:03:03.640> of<00:03:03.820> places<00:03:04.060> skill<00:03:04.570> but<00:03:05.050> at

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 
messed up a lot of places skill but at

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:07.440 
messed up a lot of places skill but at
the<00:03:05.260> same<00:03:05.440> time<00:03:05.709> that<00:03:06.010> really<00:03:06.300> doesn't<00:03:07.300> matter

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
the same time that really doesn't matter

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:09.120 
the same time that really doesn't matter
but<00:03:07.840> if<00:03:08.050> you're<00:03:08.260> a<00:03:08.290> scaler

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:09.130 
but if you're a scaler

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:10.980 
but if you're a scaler
you<00:03:09.400> probably<00:03:09.760> want<00:03:10.240> somebody<00:03:10.630> would<00:03:10.870> at

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:10.990 
you probably want somebody would at

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:13.800 
you probably want somebody would at
least<00:03:11.200> four<00:03:11.500> star<00:03:11.800> skills<00:03:12.190> and<00:03:12.880> right<00:03:13.480> now<00:03:13.660> was

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 
least four star skills and right now was

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:15.390 
least four star skills and right now was
gonna<00:03:13.959> be<00:03:14.200> that<00:03:14.380> game<00:03:14.620> I<00:03:14.650> was<00:03:14.920> talking<00:03:15.310> about

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 
gonna be that game I was talking about

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.570 
gonna be that game I was talking about
San<00:03:16.030> Jose<00:03:16.420> Earthquakes<00:03:16.540> I<00:03:17.410> think<00:03:18.400> they

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:18.580 
San Jose Earthquakes I think they

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:20.490 
San Jose Earthquakes I think they
probably<00:03:18.910> are<00:03:19.420> at<00:03:19.600> three<00:03:19.840> and<00:03:19.930> a<00:03:20.019> half<00:03:20.170> star

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
probably are at three and a half star

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.680 
probably are at three and a half star
two<00:03:20.890> star<00:03:20.920> team<00:03:21.489> two<00:03:21.850> and<00:03:22.000> a<00:03:22.030> half<00:03:22.150> star<00:03:22.420> team

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
two star team two and a half star team

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:25.560 
two star team two and a half star team
or<00:03:23.560> maybe<00:03:23.890> a<00:03:24.010> three<00:03:24.370> star<00:03:24.610> team<00:03:24.910> not<00:03:25.150> too<00:03:25.330> sure

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:25.570 
or maybe a three star team not too sure

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:29.400 
or maybe a three star team not too sure
about<00:03:25.600> this<00:03:26.110> the<00:03:26.739> the<00:03:27.430> team<00:03:27.670> rating<00:03:28.120> and<00:03:28.840> this

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:29.410 
about this the the team rating and this

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:31.880 
about this the the team rating and this
game<00:03:29.650> was<00:03:29.860> pretty<00:03:30.130> easy<00:03:30.400> and<00:03:31.060> I<00:03:31.420> believe<00:03:31.750> that

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 
game was pretty easy and I believe that

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:34.710 
game was pretty easy and I believe that
every<00:03:32.890> single<00:03:33.220> time<00:03:33.580> you<00:03:33.640> play<00:03:34.120> against<00:03:34.600> a

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 
every single time you play against a

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:37.530 
every single time you play against a
team<00:03:34.989> that's<00:03:35.230> rated<00:03:35.590> below<00:03:36.070> you<00:03:36.130> you<00:03:36.580> get<00:03:37.269> some

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:37.540 
team that's rated below you you get some

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:40.050 
team that's rated below you you get some
sort<00:03:37.840> of<00:03:37.930> they<00:03:38.470> get<00:03:38.860> some<00:03:39.100> sort<00:03:39.340> of<00:03:39.430> boost<00:03:39.670> and

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:40.060 
sort of they get some sort of boost and

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:42.090 
sort of they get some sort of boost and
I<00:03:40.390> was<00:03:40.690> having<00:03:40.989> a<00:03:41.080> tough<00:03:41.320> time<00:03:41.350> even<00:03:41.799> though<00:03:42.070> I

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:42.100 
I was having a tough time even though I

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:43.710 
I was having a tough time even though I
scored<00:03:42.549> the<00:03:42.640> first<00:03:42.850> goal<00:03:43.030> look<00:03:43.420> at<00:03:43.540> that

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:43.720 
scored the first goal look at that

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:46.110 
scored the first goal look at that
overpowered<00:03:44.530> had<00:03:44.769> it<00:03:44.950> hits<00:03:45.400> the<00:03:45.610> post<00:03:45.820> and

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 
overpowered had it hits the post and

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.960 
overpowered had it hits the post and
goes<00:03:46.299> in<00:03:46.540> and<00:03:46.810> I<00:03:47.350> felt<00:03:47.980> I<00:03:48.160> felt<00:03:48.400> like<00:03:48.549> every

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:48.970 
goes in and I felt I felt like every

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:51.180 
goes in and I felt I felt like every
single<00:03:49.209> time<00:03:49.390> I<00:03:49.570> play<00:03:49.989> against<00:03:50.830> the<00:03:50.950> team

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:51.190 
single time I play against the team

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:54.240 
single time I play against the team
that's<00:03:51.459> rated<00:03:52.030> below<00:03:52.420> my<00:03:53.080> rating<00:03:53.560> I<00:03:53.769> always

have<00:03:54.430> a<00:03:54.459> hard<00:03:54.730> time<00:03:55.030> because<00:03:55.209> they<00:03:55.480> always<00:03:55.660> put

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:56.110 
have a hard time because they always put

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:57.449 
have a hard time because they always put
in<00:03:56.200> everybody<00:03:56.650> backwards

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:57.459 
in everybody backwards

00:03:57.459 --> 00:03:59.640 
in everybody backwards
they<00:03:57.820> had<00:03:57.970> like<00:03:58.120> 10<00:03:58.480> men<00:03:58.690> defending<00:03:59.290> butchy

00:03:59.640 --> 00:03:59.650 
they had like 10 men defending butchy

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:01.470 
they had like 10 men defending butchy
but<00:03:59.890> you<00:04:00.010> gotta<00:04:00.190> sometimes<00:04:00.790> use<00:04:01.060> the<00:04:01.239> pace

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:01.480 
but you gotta sometimes use the pace

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:02.910 
but you gotta sometimes use the pace
that<00:04:01.750> you<00:04:01.900> got<00:04:02.080> on<00:04:02.230> your<00:04:02.320> team<00:04:02.530> to<00:04:02.709> break

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:02.920 
that you got on your team to break

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:04.560 
that you got on your team to break
through<00:04:03.070> their<00:04:03.250> defense<00:04:03.760> and<00:04:03.940> that's<00:04:04.090> exactly

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:04.570 
through their defense and that's exactly

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:05.690 
through their defense and that's exactly
what<00:04:04.720> I<00:04:04.750> was<00:04:04.930> doing<00:04:04.989> in<00:04:05.380> this<00:04:05.500> game

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:05.700 
what I was doing in this game

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:08.580 
what I was doing in this game
consistently<00:04:06.700> and<00:04:06.880> some<00:04:07.600> points<00:04:08.019> at<00:04:08.170> certain

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:08.590 
consistently and some points at certain

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:10.740 
consistently and some points at certain
points<00:04:08.950> I<00:04:09.040> was<00:04:09.160> using<00:04:09.340> skill<00:04:09.790> and<00:04:10.269> right<00:04:10.480> there

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:10.750

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:12.509 
points I was using skill and right there
wasn't<00:04:11.140> anything<00:04:11.350> too<00:04:11.709> special<00:04:12.040> because

00:04:12.509 --> 00:04:12.519 
wasn't anything too special because

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:14.310 
wasn't anything too special because
they're<00:04:13.090> not<00:04:13.269> that<00:04:13.450> good<00:04:13.600> of<00:04:13.720> a<00:04:13.810> team<00:04:14.019> and

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:14.320 
they're not that good of a team and

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:16.620 
they're not that good of a team and

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:16.630 
right there is another goal to make it

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:19.349 
right there is another goal to make it
to<00:04:16.989> nil<00:04:17.229> go<00:04:17.739> rats<00:04:17.950> kept<00:04:18.250> adding<00:04:18.519> his<00:04:18.970> name<00:04:19.000> to
