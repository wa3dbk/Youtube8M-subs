00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:09.319 
basically just stretch the skin and you
do<00:02:05.570> swiping<00:02:06.570> motions<00:02:07.519> and<00:02:08.519> typically<00:02:09.149> you

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:09.329 
do swiping motions and typically you

00:02:09.329 --> 00:02:09.930 
do swiping motions and typically you
only

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 
only

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.630 
only
one<00:02:10.750> or<00:02:10.930> two<00:02:11.170> passes<00:02:11.500> is<00:02:12.100> what<00:02:12.280> it's<00:02:12.430> called

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
one or two passes is what it's called

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.470 
one or two passes is what it's called
and<00:02:13.030> as<00:02:13.840> you<00:02:14.110> do<00:02:14.320> that<00:02:14.560> it's<00:02:15.400> taking<00:02:15.910> dead<00:02:16.090> skin

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
and as you do that it's taking dead skin

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.570 
and as you do that it's taking dead skin
sucking<00:02:17.020> it<00:02:17.110> up<00:02:17.230> into<00:02:17.470> here<00:02:17.860> putting<00:02:18.460> it

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
sucking it up into here putting it

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:23.550 
sucking it up into here putting it
through<00:02:18.790> a<00:02:18.880> filter<00:02:19.120> and<00:02:19.680> it's<00:02:22.410> opening<00:02:23.410> up

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
through a filter and it's opening up

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.280 
through a filter and it's opening up
your<00:02:23.710> pores<00:02:24.070> and<00:02:24.610> lessening<00:02:25.270> congestion<00:02:26.020> and

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
your pores and lessening congestion and

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:29.100 
your pores and lessening congestion and
that<00:02:26.890> happens<00:02:27.310> when<00:02:27.460> we<00:02:27.490> get<00:02:27.730> dead<00:02:28.330> skin<00:02:28.360> over

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
that happens when we get dead skin over

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:31.140 
that happens when we get dead skin over
our<00:02:29.260> pores<00:02:29.560> where<00:02:29.890> they<00:02:30.010> can't<00:02:30.280> breathe<00:02:30.610> or

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
our pores where they can't breathe or

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:34.650 
our pores where they can't breathe or
sweat<00:02:31.690> can't<00:02:32.560> come<00:02:33.520> to<00:02:33.700> this<00:02:33.850> for<00:02:34.120> that<00:02:34.270> so<00:02:34.510> it

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
sweat can't come to this for that so it

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:36.450 
sweat can't come to this for that so it
caused<00:02:34.840> a<00:02:34.870> breakout<00:02:35.320> is<00:02:35.530> yeah<00:02:35.860> and<00:02:36.010> dead<00:02:36.220> skin

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:36.460 
caused a breakout is yeah and dead skin

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:39.060 
caused a breakout is yeah and dead skin
yes<00:02:37.000> because<00:02:37.300> it<00:02:37.630> covers<00:02:38.140> over<00:02:38.320> the<00:02:38.530> port<00:02:38.830> and

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:39.070 
yes because it covers over the port and

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:40.680 
yes because it covers over the port and
it<00:02:39.550> can't<00:02:39.790> breathe

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
it can't breathe

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:42.540 
it can't breathe
so<00:02:40.780> everything<00:02:41.380> builds<00:02:41.800> up<00:02:41.980> underneath<00:02:42.160> that

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:42.550 
so everything builds up underneath that

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:43.710 
so everything builds up underneath that
in<00:02:43.030> the<00:02:43.210> pore

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
in the pore

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.980 
in the pore
now<00:02:44.290> this<00:02:44.800> little<00:02:45.010> tip<00:02:45.700> is<00:02:45.940> pretty<00:02:46.240> small<00:02:46.600> to

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:46.990 
now this little tip is pretty small to

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:48.300 
now this little tip is pretty small to
go<00:02:47.140> over<00:02:47.290> an<00:02:47.380> entire<00:02:47.500> face<00:02:47.920> does<00:02:48.220> this

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
go over an entire face does this

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:50.340 
go over an entire face does this
procedure<00:02:48.580> take<00:02:49.330> a<00:02:49.360> long<00:02:49.630> time<00:02:49.900> it<00:02:50.140> really

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:50.350 
procedure take a long time it really

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:52.050 
procedure take a long time it really
takes<00:02:50.590> 15<00:02:50.950> or<00:02:51.070> 20<00:02:51.370> minutes<00:02:51.520> Oh

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
takes 15 or 20 minutes Oh

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:53.790 
takes 15 or 20 minutes Oh
sometimes<00:02:52.630> a<00:02:52.750> half-hour<00:02:53.110> depending<00:02:53.590> on<00:02:53.710> what

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:53.800 
sometimes a half-hour depending on what

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:37.959 
wrinkles it light it for fine wrinkles

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:41.460 
wrinkles it light it for fine wrinkles
it<00:03:38.590> lessens<00:03:39.580> them<00:03:39.940> okay<00:03:40.480> for<00:03:40.810> deep<00:03:40.989> deep

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:41.470 
it lessens them okay for deep deep

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:43.229 
it lessens them okay for deep deep
wrinkles<00:03:41.950> this<00:03:42.190> probably<00:03:42.700> wouldn't<00:03:42.970> be<00:03:43.090> the

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:43.239 
wrinkles this probably wouldn't be the

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:44.460 
wrinkles this probably wouldn't be the
best<00:03:43.270> procedure<00:03:43.930> there<00:03:44.200> are<00:03:44.230> other

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
best procedure there are other

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:47.520 
best procedure there are other
procedures<00:03:45.070> for<00:03:45.280> that<00:03:45.340> okay<00:03:46.330> so<00:03:46.690> now<00:03:46.989> would

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:47.530 
procedures for that okay so now would

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:50.100 
procedures for that okay so now would
you<00:03:47.800> recommend<00:03:48.340> this<00:03:48.700> over<00:03:49.060> maybe<00:03:49.360> a<00:03:49.510> chemical

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:50.110 
you recommend this over maybe a chemical

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:53.430 
you recommend this over maybe a chemical
peel<00:03:50.410> or<00:03:51.070> it<00:03:51.850> all<00:03:52.000> depends<00:03:52.480> on<00:03:52.570> the<00:03:52.630> person<00:03:52.959> the
