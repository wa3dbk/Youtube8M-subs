00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 Good day dear friends with 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.960
 perpetuum again 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.809
 or Alexander and today I want you 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.679
 tell a little little sad 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.070
 the story 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:17.369
 the fact is that the end of the 2012 world 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.690
 after all came the great 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.090
 nuclear war 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.480
 Third World and it was followed by 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:27.930
 nuclear war nuclear mom monde sky 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:30.720
 all possible camps and eventually the world became 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:34.860
 heartless desert dead soulless 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:37.170
 dark wilderness and upstairs neither 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:40.230
 living beings are not any plants 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:43.050
 only burnt trees and nothing more 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:46.110
 so people decided to move to the caves 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.809
 and today we will live in these caves 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.300
 I will show you how to survive in the caves and 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:54.449
 what these caves can give us caves 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.579
 are under the surface 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.379
 need to dig down and we find ourselves in 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.469
 caves in which we will survive 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:04.530
 because you live upstairs impossible well 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:07.260
 so let's go over there with us 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:10.320
 you guys were down in the caves 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.420
 it's almost impossible to survive here but 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.270
 nevertheless said practically therefore you 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.369
 there is a chance of survival first here 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.890
 it is very difficult to find food what 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.630
 adds to the game as well as anyone hardcore 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.540
 as you know in the caves are led to 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.250
 many monsters and kill them will 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.740
 quite difficult because you have neither 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.909
 resources are nothing else you have to do 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.250
 no tree 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.290
 to find a tree here is very difficult only 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.570
 if you climb up and 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:39.329
 cut off the roots of one of those trees 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:42.840
 what grew earlier here you actually them 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.710
 see also mod adds stalactites and 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.810
 stalagmites 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.479
 why not when we break 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.939
 either stalactite mushroom stalagmite out of it 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.369
 here comes a rod from 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:55.079
 which can be done like this 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:57.540
 lighting block stalactites and stalagmites 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:59.909
 too hard to find but still 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.530
 possible to create such 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.420
 the block that you own everything 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.750
 light up because coal is very find 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.789
 hard you will need 4 rods set 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.450
 they are in a circle and it turns out such 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:12.690
 block 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:15.810
 also mod adds two more blocks 1 block 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:18.660
 snowy snow brick and another jungle 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.890
 war they are practically useless and to 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.379
 create snow brick 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.959
 we will need 4 blocks of snow like you 

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:26.880
 understand dug shovel 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:29.310
 we put them in the same way as 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:33.420
 rods we get snow brick 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:35.370
 here is such here you see dan also 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:38.760
 there are practically no resources here and I already 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:41.280
 spoke learning monsters and will survive 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:44.160
 difficult but possible because you can 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:46.440
 find different houses that were built 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:49.410
 people after nuclear began 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:51.480
 war underground you find these houses and 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:52.019
 there may be some things in 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.959
 chests 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:56.970
 it will be such peculiar danji but you 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:59.670
 ask me why is it still lying 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:01.650
 snow underground but the fact is that after 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:05.340
 nuclear war as you know inevitably 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:07.410
 nuclear winter comes from here and snow in 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:09.840
 In general, this is all that adds this mod 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:11.940
 I hope you will survive I hope you will 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.980
 will survive and with you was perpetuum or 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:15.030
