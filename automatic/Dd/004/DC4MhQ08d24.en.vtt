00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.410
 TV chain rather than 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:09.300
 we 're never going to mix butter flour 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.309
 and piloncillo the piloncillo we are going to 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.200
 melt very well and we will leave it as 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.120
 we melted it on a medium slow flame 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.100
 or that makes you make a honey and is 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.230
 very well since it is cold we are going to 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.670
 toss the flour and the butter 160 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.830
 because we are now we say the 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:26.550
 ingredients we need flour 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:28.920
 butter and honey from piloncillo because 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.560
 he avoided we are aiming very well 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.630
 I recommend dark piloncillo 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.410
 dark but if they are clear there is no 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:39.120
 no problem 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:42.390
 dark if there is one darker and one good 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.340
 and where we buy it good this is more 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.469
 remains and of course I'm seeing then in 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.780
 the market and additional unit merck 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.640
 ok I was very good because it's good 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.199
 option these two types of piloncillo the 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.059
 you really have to check it and you have to see what 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.710
 well these are the ingredients we are 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.480
 it seems the cookies we mix up 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.719
 have a cookie like the one you're going to have 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.239
 here my dear here is the mass like 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.250
 they see it is the color of the piloncillo 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:06.659
 I'm always tight for me 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.509
 better ok to have 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.729
 more to give more sugar we notice that 

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:14.609
 it's less sugary less sugar like that or 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:17.520
 because I think it's more toasted and 

00:01:14.609 --> 00:01:19.409
 then it's less sweet than gÃ¼ero ok 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.390
 then we will extend it to who 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.609
 I have the dough a little bit of flour 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.399
 little bit very useful and I give them 

00:01:23.609 --> 00:01:28.439
 if the if the masita were watered down because you 

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:30.810
 they put a little more flour does not pass 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.880
 nothing does not happen 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:37.049
 and I think that here we have icing sugar 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:39.329
 yes because that's going to be for the decoration 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:41.520
 decorated exactly what I'm going to put on 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.710
 a bowl of these and we're putting them on 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.380
 icing sugar very well exposing also 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:49.320
 the whites the whites ok 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:52.590
 the lemon and lemon lemons ok 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.750
 then I 'm going mixing it, I'm going to go 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.299
 because because it has to be delayed 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.950
 mix all this to make those of 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.780
 tunisia with which we are going to delay 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.700
 adequately preserves three artists 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.590
 of metiche but good good look here 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.299
 I molds are all everything of 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.549
 halloween what you want and if 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:10.910
 I want them to do for Christmas because there 

00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:13.819
 matter the cutter then we're going to 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:16.999
 cut the cookies 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:19.639
 with different halloween motives look 

00:02:16.999 --> 00:02:21.829
 that are a little bit chubby so that 

00:02:19.639 --> 00:02:23.810
 are to be firm exactly very 

00:02:21.829 --> 00:02:25.790
 well that 's very good because of 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:27.620
 suddenly it happens to us I'm seeing that 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.200
 here you have about four point 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:33.170
 exactly 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:36.920
 I'm going to put in the tray very 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:39.829
 they bake so direct direct to 160 degrees 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.419
 with about 10 minutes we do not need 

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:44.060
 replicate or nothing 

00:02:41.419 --> 00:02:46.819
 we do not need real jehovah I think here 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:49.159
 as already seen for the oven very 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:51.019
 well and they go to the oven they go by 

00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:53.959
 how many minutes deigned about ten 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:58.280
 minutes ten minutes nothing more me here 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:59.810
 I'm going with this worked because if I do not 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.919
 is going to scold the patron as she says that 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:03.109
 I have a girl who will help me 

00:03:00.919 --> 00:03:05.870
 you waste what is your employer and you give me 

00:03:03.109 --> 00:03:08.000
 so much laugh ok and here of course like 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:11.290
 all of us television already have some already 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.040
 we have an administrator and here they are 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:15.769
 baked and 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:19.430
 to decorate them here what is doing 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:22.010
 peanut is nothing but whipped milkshake that is 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:23.810
 put on the dough ok let's put 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:25.159
 dyes the dyes that you 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:27.769
 want as you like the 

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:29.959
 combinations here we have orange 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:32.480
 purple green and here are the colors 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:35.209
 as I say we can buy them heart 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:37.930
 in the matter raw material things 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:40.400
 premium and they are colorants and they are colorants 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:42.560
 vegetable edible string that is 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:45.920
 exactly why he has not wanted me 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:47.629
 I'm spoiled for appointment because that's how you do accounts if 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:50.120
 you want to put green you throw 

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:53.090
 droplets truth that we already mix 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:55.250
 very well you give the tone that you want 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:56.930
 ok perfect we already have here already saw as 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:59.000
 this class was made that is like a class 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:01.340
 really at the end of accounts more or 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.439
 less and I can paint it the color that 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:07.310
 it requires your preference that you need 

00:04:03.439 --> 00:04:08.600
 a few teaspoons ok a little stick very well and 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:11.060
 we are going to 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:14.210
 here I already have some cookies but we are going to 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:17.480
 make a the bat ok here I have and 

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:19.610
 the wounds this and what we're going to do 

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:22.340
 is that we're going to cover all of them already 

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:26.030
 seeing how easy it is to do well nothing 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:28.760
 more very simple very rich or so 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:31.430
 so that we do it with family and family 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:34.220
 this is it or for children's parties 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:37.640
 There is of course another very good option as well 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:39.410
 what is already here then I have to 

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:42.410
 that they see that it is also very easy 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:44.630

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:51.910

00:04:55.529 --> 00:05:01.229
 black glass to give environment then with 

00:04:59.789 --> 00:05:04.349
 teaspoon 

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:06.749

 my mom's click on this is a 

00:05:12.719 --> 00:05:15.319
 wonder 

00:05:16.279 --> 00:05:21.449
 because we cut a little bit too well 

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:23.459
 the tip and it goes away they realize that 

00:05:21.449 --> 00:05:26.239
 here I will make the outline of the 

00:05:23.459 --> 00:05:26.239
 bat 

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:33.700
 How easy do you do not have a 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:38.040
