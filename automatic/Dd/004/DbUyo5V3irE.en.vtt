00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:16.310 
only dark elixir is not so good but we

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:17.830 
only dark elixir is not so good but we
didn't<00:04:16.520> use<00:04:16.549> dark<00:04:16.790> elixir<00:04:16.970> further<00:04:17.359> rates<00:04:17.630> so

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:17.840 
didn't use dark elixir further rates so

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:20.140 
didn't use dark elixir further rates so
it<00:04:17.930> doesn't<00:04:18.140> really<00:04:18.260> matter<00:04:18.440> but<00:04:19.280> the<00:04:19.729> elixir

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:20.150 
it doesn't really matter but the elixir

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:21.800 
it doesn't really matter but the elixir
paid<00:04:20.510> off<00:04:20.750> for<00:04:21.020> the<00:04:21.109> troops<00:04:21.350> will
