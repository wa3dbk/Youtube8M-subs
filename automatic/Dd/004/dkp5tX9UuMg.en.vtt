00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
is the Spectre dragon and I guess we

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.039 
is the Spectre dragon and I guess we
still<00:00:12.870> have<00:00:13.139> a<00:00:13.170> free<00:00:13.500> gift<00:00:13.799> to<00:00:14.040> open<00:00:14.690> let's<00:00:15.690> do

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.859 
still have a free gift to open let's do
that<00:00:16.289> now<00:00:16.650> and<00:00:17.039> we<00:00:17.609> got<00:00:17.820> some<00:00:18.150> gold<00:00:18.359> all<00:00:18.660> right

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869
