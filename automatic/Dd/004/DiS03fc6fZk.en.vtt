00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
gonna see of this is that all these

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.510 
gonna see of this is that all these
Nexus<00:00:37.590> phones<00:00:37.800> that<00:00:37.950> have<00:00:38.070> been<00:00:38.190> kind<00:00:38.340> of<00:00:38.460> the

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
Nexus phones that have been kind of the

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.060 
Nexus phones that have been kind of the
Google<00:00:39.000> branded<00:00:39.450> phones<00:00:39.750> especially<00:00:40.469> follow

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
Google branded phones especially follow

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.530 
Google branded phones especially follow
the<00:00:41.190> developers<00:00:41.670> have<00:00:41.820> already<00:00:41.969> always<00:00:42.270> been

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
the developers have already always been

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.000 
the developers have already always been
using<00:00:42.719> these<00:00:42.899> Nexus<00:00:43.290> phones<00:00:43.469> are<00:00:43.680> gonna<00:00:43.829> go

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
using these Nexus phones are gonna go

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.889 
using these Nexus phones are gonna go
away<00:00:44.210> Motorola<00:00:45.210> phones<00:00:45.450> will<00:00:45.600> start<00:00:45.809> to

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
away Motorola phones will start to

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.569 
away Motorola phones will start to
replace<00:00:46.260> that<00:00:46.469> now<00:00:46.800> I<00:00:46.860> think<00:00:46.950> Motorola<00:00:47.460> now

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
replace that now I think Motorola now

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.910 
replace that now I think Motorola now
has<00:00:47.820> about<00:00:47.969> 3%<00:00:48.840> of<00:00:49.079> the<00:00:49.140> Android<00:00:49.590> Market

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
has about 3% of the Android Market

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.880 
has about 3% of the Android Market

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
shares for our cell phone so I mean I

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.350 
shares for our cell phone so I mean I

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
don't I don't see the thing that this is

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.180 
don't I don't see the thing that this is
gonna<00:00:54.570> overtake<00:00:55.199> and<00:00:55.410> leap<00:00:55.590> over<00:00:55.739> you<00:00:56.100> know

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
gonna overtake and leap over you know

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.279 
gonna overtake and leap over you know
HTC<00:00:56.789> as<00:00:56.940> far<00:00:57.149> as<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.390> handset<00:00:57.780> manufacturer

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
HTC as far as the handset manufacturer

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.110 
HTC as far as the handset manufacturer
just<00:00:58.320> because<00:00:58.649> Google<00:00:58.949> now<00:00:59.070> owns<00:00:59.370> them<00:00:59.609> but<00:01:00.059> I

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
just because Google now owns them but I

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.130 
just because Google now owns them but I
do<00:01:00.180> think<00:01:00.449> we<00:01:00.539> will<00:01:00.629> probably<00:01:00.660> see<00:01:00.960> some

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
do think we will probably see some

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.660 
do think we will probably see some
better<00:01:01.469> specific<00:01:02.070> phones<00:01:02.309> coming<00:01:02.579> from

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
better specific phones coming from

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.219 
better specific phones coming from
Motorola<00:01:03.059> that<00:01:03.210> definitely<00:01:03.539> help<00:01:03.750> increase

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
Motorola that definitely help increase

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.380 
Motorola that definitely help increase
their<00:01:04.470> stock<00:01:04.799> a<00:01:04.830> little<00:01:05.159> bit<00:01:05.309> Rasta<00:01:06.030> -<00:01:06.150> I<00:01:06.180> think

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
their stock a little bit Rasta - I think

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:07.580 
their stock a little bit Rasta - I think
most<00:01:06.600> importantly<00:01:06.960> we're<00:01:07.110> gonna<00:01:07.290> see<00:01:07.409> some

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
most importantly we're gonna see some

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.580 
most importantly we're gonna see some
specific<00:01:08.280> Android<00:01:08.840> Google<00:01:09.840> phones<00:01:10.080> and<00:01:10.439> then

could<00:01:23.640> be<00:01:23.729> even<00:01:23.939> a<00:01:24.060> higher<00:01:24.210> number<00:01:24.360> than<00:01:24.509> that

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
could be even a higher number than that

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.380 
could be even a higher number than that
so<00:01:25.229> over<00:01:25.490> 17,000<00:01:26.490> patents<00:01:26.909> with<00:01:27.030> this<00:01:27.210> now

so over 17,000 patents with this now

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.270 
so over 17,000 patents with this now

these other companies who are poorly
supposedly<00:01:35.670> attacking<00:01:36.119> Google<00:01:36.420> for<00:01:36.570> patents

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:37.280 
supposedly attacking Google for patents

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.160 
supposedly attacking Google for patents
unjustly<00:01:38.280> that's<00:01:38.970> what<00:01:39.090> Google<00:01:39.210> says<00:01:39.540> they

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
unjustly that's what Google says they

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.569 
unjustly that's what Google says they
had<00:01:40.320> to<00:01:40.439> get<00:01:40.650> these<00:01:40.740> patents<00:01:41.159> in<00:01:41.250> order<00:01:41.460> to

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
had to get these patents in order to

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.069 
had to get these patents in order to
protect<00:01:41.759> themselves<00:01:42.329> so<00:01:42.450> that's<00:01:42.540> just<00:01:42.720> Lisa

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
protect themselves so that's just Lisa

this<00:01:43.290> whole<00:01:43.439> patent<00:01:43.740> war<00:01:43.950> and<00:01:44.040> I'll<00:01:44.100> probably

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
this whole patent war and I'll probably

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.789 
this whole patent war and I'll probably
talk<00:01:44.460> about<00:01:44.700> this<00:01:44.820> in<00:01:45.000> another<00:01:45.060> video<00:01:45.500> but<00:01:46.500> I

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
talk about this in another video but I

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.440 
talk about this in another video but I
think<00:01:47.399> that<00:01:47.520> this<00:01:47.640> is<00:01:47.759> making<00:01:47.909> things<00:01:48.180> pretty

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
think that this is making things pretty

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.300 
think that this is making things pretty
interesting<00:01:49.140> I<00:01:49.200> think<00:01:49.259> Gizmodo<00:01:49.500> made<00:01:49.979> a<00:01:50.009> post

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
interesting I think Gizmodo made a post

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.889 
interesting I think Gizmodo made a post
and<00:01:50.490> they<00:01:50.549> call<00:01:50.820> patents<00:01:51.659> or<00:01:51.720> the<00:01:51.780> new

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
and they call patents or the new

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.569 
and they call patents or the new
basketball<00:01:52.380> cards<00:01:52.829> you<00:01:52.979> know<00:01:53.100> that<00:01:53.310> you<00:01:53.430> want

basketball cards you know that you want

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.280 
basketball cards you know that you want
to<00:01:53.610> collect<00:01:53.880> and<00:01:54.149> hold<00:01:54.240> on<00:01:54.479> to<00:01:54.750> you<00:01:54.840> absolutely

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
to collect and hold on to you absolutely

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:56.810

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
need to use them to kind of protect

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.670 
need to use them to kind of protect
yourself<00:01:57.210> so<00:01:57.990> Google<00:01:58.290> is<00:01:58.320> getting<00:01:58.530> about

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
yourself so Google is getting about

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.319 
yourself so Google is getting about
17,000<00:01:59.490> patents<00:01:59.820> which<00:01:59.939> is<00:02:00.060> going<00:02:00.210> to

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
17,000 patents which is going to

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:01.880 
17,000 patents which is going to
definitely<00:02:00.479> help<00:02:00.750> them<00:02:00.960> in<00:02:01.140> the<00:02:01.229> long<00:02:01.409> run<00:02:01.680> so

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
definitely help them in the long run so

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.410 
definitely help them in the long run so
overall<00:02:02.490> I<00:02:02.640> think<00:02:02.729> it's<00:02:02.939> going<00:02:03.060> to<00:02:03.090> be<00:02:03.240> a

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
overall I think it's going to be a

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:04.550 
overall I think it's going to be a
little<00:02:03.689> while<00:02:03.780> before<00:02:03.810> really<00:02:04.320> see<00:02:04.439> the
