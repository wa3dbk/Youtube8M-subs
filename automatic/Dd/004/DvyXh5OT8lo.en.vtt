 a logo is divided into two 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.580
 elements of the typographical or 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:23.460
 the text representing the name of the 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.230
 your company and the graphics that 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.970
 are the symbols or adornments that 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.890
 increment your logo 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.830
 for example when we see the 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.540
 macdonald's think logo the way 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.640
 which is and how is the mec 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.070
 But we also think of that and 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.579
 wig of curves that can be used 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.760
 alone and still get the message 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:44.520
 perfectly 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.239
 the same can be said for the symbol of 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.460
 nike 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.440
 by more than the name mike in the default font 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.559
 in logo or is super easy to 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.149
 recognize the famous risquinho enough to 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.280

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.170
 create a logo that is perfect 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.690
 harmony and in which so many elements 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.180
 as symbolic represent 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.790
 perfectly picture of your company is 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.909

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:11.250
 sensitivity and talent for art 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.680
 after all, the different sources with which 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.320
 we can describe the logo that is the 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.420
 textual part of the logo should be 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.000
 selected in order to transmit by 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:24.420
 through its curves and its design to 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.200
 fluidity and the energy of your 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.090
 brand 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.790

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:32.490

 capable of transmitting the message and image 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.860
 that you want without a real 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:58.740
 carnival happened in your logo 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:01.170

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.470
 survives only by listening to what 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.960
 we talk in 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:15.490
 previously it is evidence that less is 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:17.810
 more so than wolves 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:20.300
