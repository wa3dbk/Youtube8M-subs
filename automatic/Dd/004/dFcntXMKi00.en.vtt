kind of had a little bit of issues
trying<00:00:13.440> to<00:00:13.469> learn<00:00:13.620> how<00:00:13.740> to<00:00:13.830> hook<00:00:13.950> it<00:00:14.070> up<00:00:14.219> I've

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
trying to learn how to hook it up I've

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.080 
trying to learn how to hook it up I've
got<00:00:15.330> it<00:00:15.480> hooked<00:00:16.320> up<00:00:16.500> now<00:00:16.710> I'm<00:00:16.770> just<00:00:17.039> not<00:00:17.520> in<00:00:18.060> the

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
got it hooked up now I'm just not in the

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.010 
got it hooked up now I'm just not in the
prime<00:00:18.390> but<00:00:18.810> um<00:00:19.020> this<00:00:19.590> is<00:00:19.800> my<00:00:19.949> flag<00:00:20.279> system<00:00:21.150> when

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.560 
prime but um this is my flag system when
I<00:00:22.310> cover<00:00:23.310> on<00:00:23.430> my<00:00:23.460> remote<00:00:24.740> this<00:00:25.740> is<00:00:25.920> a<00:00:26.010> Futaba<00:00:26.570> 10

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
I cover on my remote this is a Futaba 10

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.580 
I cover on my remote this is a Futaba 10
or<00:00:27.840> t10<00:00:28.849> chg<00:00:29.849> this<00:00:30.840> is<00:00:30.990> the<00:00:31.140> helicopter

version<00:00:31.949> but<00:00:32.219> my<00:00:32.610> flight<00:00:32.730> look<00:00:33.030> out<00:00:33.149> there's<00:00:33.360> a

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
version but my flight look out there's a

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.959 
version but my flight look out there's a
lot<00:00:33.600> so<00:00:33.930> I'd<00:00:34.559> rather<00:00:34.739> have<00:00:35.040> this<00:00:35.190> radio<00:00:35.550> with

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
lot so I'd rather have this radio with

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.470 
lot so I'd rather have this radio with
helicopters<00:00:36.600> as<00:00:37.350> I<00:00:37.559> pull<00:00:37.829> this<00:00:38.219> pin<00:00:38.520> out<00:00:38.550> this

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
helicopters as I pull this pin out this

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.360 
helicopters as I pull this pin out this
thing<00:00:39.840> should<00:00:40.110> power<00:00:40.379> ups<00:00:40.739> if<00:00:41.010> I'm<00:00:41.129> going<00:00:41.309> to

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
thing should power ups if I'm going to

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.970 
thing should power ups if I'm going to
pull<00:00:41.610> out<00:00:41.730> one<00:00:42.030> finger<00:00:42.500> it's<00:00:43.500> pretty<00:00:43.800> tough

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
pull out one finger it's pretty tough

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:53.360 
pull out one finger it's pretty tough
pin

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:59.189 

as<00:00:54.370> I<00:00:54.550> pull<00:00:54.850> that<00:00:54.879> pin<00:00:55.300> out<00:00:55.510> it<00:00:55.870> shows<00:00:58.019> it<00:00:59.019> lets

00:00:59.189 --> 00:00:59.199 
as I pull that pin out it shows it lets

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:01.889 
as I pull that pin out it shows it lets
me<00:00:59.410> know<00:00:59.590> but<00:00:59.829> it'll<00:01:00.309> stay<00:01:00.640> I<00:01:00.970> think<00:01:01.210> it's<00:01:01.329> su

00:01:01.889 --> 00:01:01.899 
me know but it'll stay I think it's su

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:04.410 
me know but it'll stay I think it's su
is<00:01:02.110> where<00:01:02.949> that<00:01:03.160> sets<00:01:03.550> in<00:01:03.850> and<00:01:04.089> one<00:01:04.239> of<00:01:04.330> these

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:04.420 
is where that sets in and one of these

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:08.399 
is where that sets in and one of these
ports<00:01:06.270> ordered<00:01:07.270> to<00:01:07.390> get<00:01:07.509> the<00:01:07.659> fiber<00:01:07.869> optic<00:01:08.290> to

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:08.409 
ports ordered to get the fiber optic to

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:10.380 
ports ordered to get the fiber optic to
work<00:01:08.590> I'd<00:01:08.830> go<00:01:09.040> online<00:01:09.190> and<00:01:09.580> check<00:01:09.880> it<00:01:10.240> out

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:10.390 
work I'd go online and check it out

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:14.399 
work I'd go online and check it out
it'll<00:01:10.780> say<00:01:11.050> I<00:01:11.650> think<00:01:12.159> it's<00:01:12.340> IC<00:01:13.000> for<00:01:13.780> ignition

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:14.409 
it'll say I think it's IC for ignition

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:18.170 
it'll say I think it's IC for ignition
then<00:01:14.800> I<00:01:14.830> hooked<00:01:15.130> it<00:01:15.280> up<00:01:15.369> to<00:01:15.640> G<00:01:16.320> channel<00:01:17.320> G<00:01:17.500> and

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
then I hooked it up to G channel G and

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.940 
then I hooked it up to G channel G and
as<00:01:19.180> I<00:01:19.750> flip<00:01:20.170> my<00:01:20.530> channel<00:01:21.220> oh<00:01:21.960> yeah<00:01:22.960> where's<00:01:23.860> my

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:23.950 
as I flip my channel oh yeah where's my

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:29.669 
as I flip my channel oh yeah where's my
fiber<00:01:24.520> optic<00:01:24.850> light<00:01:27.929> this<00:01:28.929> light<00:01:29.259> should<00:01:29.619> come

00:01:29.669 --> 00:01:29.679 
fiber optic light this light should come

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:36.060 
fiber optic light this light should come
on<00:01:30.960> let<00:01:31.960> me<00:01:31.990> have<00:01:32.670> full<00:01:34.500> power<00:01:35.500> of<00:01:35.710> my<00:01:35.860> coal

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:36.070 
on let me have full power of my coal

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:38.760 
on let me have full power of my coal
system<00:01:36.550> how<00:01:36.789> much<00:01:37.000> on<00:01:37.270> my<00:01:37.420> plane<00:01:37.690> this<00:01:38.500> right

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:38.770 
system how much on my plane this right

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:42.029 
system how much on my plane this right
here<00:01:38.979> would<00:01:39.130> hook<00:01:39.280> up<00:01:39.520> to<00:01:39.700> my<00:01:39.940> coal<00:01:40.450> system<00:01:41.039> it

00:01:42.029 --> 00:01:42.039 
here would hook up to my coal system it

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:45.450 
here would hook up to my coal system it
hooks<00:01:42.340> to<00:01:42.610> here<00:01:43.000> runs<00:01:43.600> around<00:01:43.780> as<00:01:44.320> you<00:01:44.470> see<00:01:44.740> in

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:45.460 
hooks to here runs around as you see in

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:47.460 
hooks to here runs around as you see in
those<00:01:45.880> ends<00:01:46.210> the<00:01:46.450> fiber<00:01:46.659> optic<00:01:47.050> system

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:47.470 
those ends the fiber optic system

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:49.830 
those ends the fiber optic system
because<00:01:48.340> they're<00:01:48.520> the<00:01:48.970> LED<00:01:49.330> this<00:01:49.450> lets<00:01:49.690> me

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:49.840 
because they're the LED this lets me

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.650 
because they're the LED this lets me
know<00:01:49.869> that<00:01:50.289> I<00:01:50.530> have<00:01:50.890> power<00:01:51.340> through<00:01:52.300> my<00:01:52.330> core

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:52.660 
know that I have power through my core

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:57.449 
know that I have power through my core
I'm<00:01:53.619> running<00:01:53.950> just<00:01:54.130> the<00:01:54.690> 4.8<00:01:55.690> battery<00:01:56.080> pack<00:01:56.459> so

00:01:57.449 --> 00:01:57.459 
I'm running just the 4.8 battery pack so

00:01:57.459 --> 00:01:59.760 
I'm running just the 4.8 battery pack so
these<00:01:58.300> batteries<00:01:58.690> here<00:01:58.869> will<00:01:58.989> be<00:01:59.110> replaced

00:01:59.760 --> 00:01:59.770 
these batteries here will be replaced

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:01.440 
these batteries here will be replaced
I've<00:02:00.009> had<00:02:00.280> these<00:02:00.429> batteries<00:02:00.789> for<00:02:00.970> a<00:02:01.000> while<00:02:01.179> but

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.450 
I've had these batteries for a while but

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:04.109 
I've had these batteries for a while but
they<00:02:01.599> do<00:02:01.660> fly<00:02:01.929> the<00:02:02.050> plane<00:02:02.489> I'm<00:02:03.489> still<00:02:03.940> learning

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:04.119 
they do fly the plane I'm still learning

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:05.820 
they do fly the plane I'm still learning
though<00:02:04.509> how<00:02:04.750> to<00:02:04.810> hook<00:02:04.989> this<00:02:05.170> stuff<00:02:05.380> up

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:05.830 
though how to hook this stuff up

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:09.779 
though how to hook this stuff up
I<00:02:06.090> think<00:02:07.090> the<00:02:08.130> currently<00:02:09.130> right<00:02:09.340> now<00:02:09.369> hooked

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:09.789 
I think the currently right now hooked

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:14.670 
I think the currently right now hooked
up<00:02:09.970> in<00:02:10.119> my<00:02:10.330> airline<00:02:11.880> so<00:02:13.050> is<00:02:14.050> what<00:02:14.260> this<00:02:14.440> thing

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
up in my airline so is what this thing

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.920 
up in my airline so is what this thing
does<00:02:14.920> is<00:02:14.980> pretty<00:02:15.580> mean<00:02:15.849> that<00:02:16.239> when<00:02:16.630> you<00:02:16.660> plug

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
does is pretty mean that when you plug

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:21.210 
does is pretty mean that when you plug
up<00:02:17.170> each<00:02:17.920> one<00:02:18.129> of<00:02:18.250> these<00:02:18.340> bus<00:02:18.580> bars<00:02:18.840> this<00:02:20.220> each

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
up each one of these bus bars this each

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.970 
up each one of these bus bars this each
servo<00:02:21.670> will<00:02:21.849> get<00:02:22.030> it<00:02:22.120> almost<00:02:22.629> exactly<00:02:23.110> 6<00:02:23.560> volts

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
servo will get it almost exactly 6 volts

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.210 
servo will get it almost exactly 6 volts
of<00:02:24.550> power<00:02:24.610> it<00:02:25.150> won't<00:02:25.390> slag<00:02:25.840> or<00:02:26.110> whatnot<00:02:26.319> it's

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
of power it won't slag or whatnot it's

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:30.839 
of power it won't slag or whatnot it's
just<00:02:27.520> a<00:02:27.989> really<00:02:28.989> neat<00:02:29.230> little<00:02:29.700> thing<00:02:30.700> to<00:02:30.819> have

00:02:30.839 --> 00:02:30.849 
just a really neat little thing to have

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:33.869 
just a really neat little thing to have
for<00:02:31.239> your<00:02:31.330> plane<00:02:31.709> I<00:02:32.709> was<00:02:33.190> introduced<00:02:33.580> to<00:02:33.670> these

00:02:33.869 --> 00:02:33.879 
for your plane I was introduced to these

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:35.729 
for your plane I was introduced to these
about<00:02:34.239> a<00:02:34.270> couple<00:02:34.599> years<00:02:34.810> ago<00:02:34.930> at<00:02:35.170> a<00:02:35.200> flat<00:02:35.440> field

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:35.739 
about a couple years ago at a flat field

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:38.670 
about a couple years ago at a flat field
a<00:02:36.010> friend<00:02:36.370> of<00:02:36.459> mine<00:02:36.550> had<00:02:36.790> it<00:02:36.940> and<00:02:37.260> it<00:02:38.260> kind<00:02:38.650> of

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
a friend of mine had it and it kind of

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.190 
a friend of mine had it and it kind of
looked<00:02:38.830> like<00:02:38.860> a<00:02:38.950> laptop<00:02:39.220> sitting<00:02:39.670> in<00:02:39.819> there<00:02:40.200> it

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
looked like a laptop sitting in there it

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:42.540 
looked like a laptop sitting in there it
just<00:02:41.379> look<00:02:41.530> weird<00:02:41.680> never<00:02:42.010> saw<00:02:42.220> anything<00:02:42.400> like

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:42.550 
just look weird never saw anything like

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:45.990 
just look weird never saw anything like
that<00:02:42.610> before<00:02:42.879> but<00:02:43.270> it's<00:02:44.140> it's<00:02:44.590> roughly<00:02:45.370> about

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
that before but it's it's roughly about

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.300 
that before but it's it's roughly about
eight<00:02:46.510> inches<00:02:46.959> probably<00:02:47.290> it's<00:02:47.709> just<00:02:47.769> a<00:02:48.040> little

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
eight inches probably it's just a little

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:50.160 
eight inches probably it's just a little
about<00:02:48.790> as<00:02:48.940> long<00:02:49.120> as<00:02:49.239> your<00:02:49.360> hand<00:02:49.569> palm<00:02:49.930> your

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
about as long as your hand palm your

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.610 
about as long as your hand palm your
hand<00:02:50.319> as<00:02:50.500> you<00:02:50.620> see<00:02:50.970> but<00:02:51.970> it's<00:02:52.720> pretty<00:02:52.959> big<00:02:53.200> but

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
hand as you see but it's pretty big but

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:55.830 
hand as you see but it's pretty big but
it's<00:02:54.099> pretty<00:02:54.250> neat<00:02:54.489> the<00:02:54.760> flag<00:02:54.970> port<00:02:55.269> is<00:02:55.510> cool

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
it's pretty neat the flag port is cool

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.270 
it's pretty neat the flag port is cool
you<00:02:56.110> see<00:02:56.319> I'm<00:02:56.410> sticking<00:02:56.770> out<00:02:56.860> of<00:02:56.980> the<00:02:57.040> plane

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
you see I'm sticking out of the plane

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.670 
you see I'm sticking out of the plane
you're<00:02:57.490> like<00:02:57.670> man<00:02:57.940> what<00:02:58.270> is<00:02:58.390> that<00:02:58.470> they<00:02:59.470> pull

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
you're like man what is that they pull

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.170 
you're like man what is that they pull
it<00:02:59.830> out<00:02:59.950> in<00:03:00.040> the<00:03:00.130> plane<00:03:00.340> comes<00:03:00.550> up<00:03:00.820> so<00:03:01.030> this

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
it out in the plane comes up so this

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.140 
it out in the plane comes up so this
Purdue<00:03:02.130> I've<00:03:03.130> been<00:03:03.280> flying<00:03:03.460> the<00:03:03.640> radio<00:03:03.910> now

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150 
Purdue I've been flying the radio now

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:08.450 
Purdue I've been flying the radio now
for<00:03:04.570> at<00:03:04.930> least<00:03:05.170> a<00:03:05.590> year<00:03:05.770> year<00:03:06.490> two<00:03:06.730> so<00:03:07.120> I

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:08.460 
for at least a year year two so I

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:10.820 
for at least a year year two so I
haven't<00:03:09.460> had<00:03:09.610> one<00:03:09.640> of<00:03:09.880> these<00:03:10.000> systems<00:03:10.510> it's

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:10.830 
haven't had one of these systems it's

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:14.070 
haven't had one of these systems it's
been<00:03:11.830> a<00:03:12.000> pretty<00:03:13.000> neat<00:03:13.180> little<00:03:13.210> system<00:03:13.420> stereo

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:14.080 
been a pretty neat little system stereo

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:15.540 
been a pretty neat little system stereo
out<00:03:14.140> for<00:03:14.350> a<00:03:14.380> while<00:03:14.560> and<00:03:14.740> finally<00:03:15.100> I<00:03:15.160> got<00:03:15.220> enough

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:15.550 
out for a while and finally I got enough

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:17.910 
out for a while and finally I got enough
nerve<00:03:15.760> today<00:03:16.090> to<00:03:16.150> power<00:03:17.110> it<00:03:17.290> up<00:03:17.380> and<00:03:17.560> see<00:03:17.770> what

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920 
nerve today to power it up and see what

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.220 
nerve today to power it up and see what
it<00:03:18.010> do<00:03:18.250> hopefully<00:03:19.120> I'll<00:03:19.450> get<00:03:19.600> some<00:03:19.660> servos<00:03:20.200> and

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:20.230 
it do hopefully I'll get some servos and

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:22.080 
it do hopefully I'll get some servos and
I'll<00:03:20.500> be<00:03:20.590> able<00:03:20.650> to<00:03:20.770> put<00:03:20.890> it<00:03:20.980> my<00:03:21.069> plane<00:03:21.370> and<00:03:21.819> I've

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 
I'll be able to put it my plane and I've

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:23.130 
I'll be able to put it my plane and I've
got<00:03:22.240> to<00:03:22.330> get<00:03:22.390> some<00:03:22.569> different<00:03:22.660> batteries

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:23.140 
got to get some different batteries

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:25.350 
got to get some different batteries
these<00:03:23.440> batteries<00:03:23.740> will<00:03:23.770> work<00:03:24.100> I<00:03:24.340> prefer<00:03:25.120> some

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:25.360 
these batteries will work I prefer some

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:27.080 
these batteries will work I prefer some
a<00:03:25.390> little<00:03:25.480> bit<00:03:25.600> stronger<00:03:26.080> and<00:03:26.140> better

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
a little bit stronger and better

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:31.080 
a little bit stronger and better
there<00:03:28.090> you<00:03:28.240> have<00:03:28.450> it<00:03:28.480> as<00:03:28.840> tell<00:03:29.080> my<00:03:30.090> mission

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090 
there you have it as tell my mission

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:31.590 
there you have it as tell my mission
works

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:31.600 
works

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.530 
works
so<00:03:31.990> if<00:03:32.200> I<00:03:32.620> have<00:03:32.830> engine<00:03:33.280> engine<00:03:33.790> failure<00:03:34.330> like

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 
so if I have engine engine failure like

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.840 
so if I have engine engine failure like
say<00:03:34.750> if<00:03:34.840> I<00:03:34.960> have<00:03:35.140> a<00:03:35.260> throttle<00:03:35.710> to<00:03:36.280> hang<00:03:36.430> up<00:03:36.640> I

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:36.850 
say if I have a throttle to hang up I

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:39.240 
say if I have a throttle to hang up I
can<00:03:37.480> kill<00:03:37.720> the<00:03:37.840> ignition<00:03:37.960> as<00:03:38.440> I'm<00:03:38.770> coming<00:03:39.100> in

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.250 
can kill the ignition as I'm coming in

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:44.670 
can kill the ignition as I'm coming in
to<00:03:39.430> land<00:03:39.580> it<00:03:39.990> if<00:03:40.990> I<00:03:41.319> have<00:03:41.620> let's<00:03:42.310> see<00:03:43.680> well

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:44.680 
to land it if I have let's see well

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:46.380 
to land it if I have let's see well
currently<00:03:45.400> right<00:03:45.670> now<00:03:45.700> the<00:03:45.880> only<00:03:46.060> thing<00:03:46.150> what

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:46.390 
currently right now the only thing what

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:47.940 
currently right now the only thing what
happened<00:03:46.750> I<00:03:46.780> guess<00:03:46.990> if<00:03:47.230> they<00:03:47.380> would<00:03:47.530> hung<00:03:47.709> wide

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:47.950 
happened I guess if they would hung wide

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:50.250 
happened I guess if they would hung wide
open<00:03:48.310> that<00:03:49.120> would<00:03:49.270> kill<00:03:49.480> it<00:03:49.630> have<00:03:49.900> a<00:03:49.990> kill<00:03:50.170> the

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:50.260 
open that would kill it have a kill the

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:50.670 
open that would kill it have a kill the
ignition

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:50.680 
ignition

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:54.059 
ignition
I<00:03:50.830> do<00:03:51.190> have<00:03:51.550> right<00:03:52.090> here<00:03:52.300> throttle<00:03:52.780> cut<00:03:53.069> that

00:03:54.059 --> 00:03:54.069 
I do have right here throttle cut that

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:56.400 
I do have right here throttle cut that
actually<00:03:54.790> will<00:03:55.030> take<00:03:55.270> the<00:03:55.390> servo<00:03:55.780> and<00:03:56.020> send<00:03:56.319> it

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:56.410 
actually will take the servo and send it

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:58.380 
actually will take the servo and send it
all<00:03:56.500> the<00:03:56.530> way<00:03:56.709> to<00:03:56.740> the<00:03:57.430> butterfly<00:03:57.850> close<00:03:58.150> on

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:58.390 
all the way to the butterfly close on

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:00.809 
all the way to the butterfly close on
the<00:03:58.480> carburetor<00:03:58.900> so<00:03:59.620> I<00:03:59.920> want<00:04:00.400> to<00:04:00.459> get<00:04:00.550> one<00:04:00.730> of

00:04:00.809 --> 00:04:00.819 
the carburetor so I want to get one of

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:02.790 
the carburetor so I want to get one of
those<00:04:00.970> and<00:04:01.300> I'll<00:04:01.420> actually<00:04:01.720> you<00:04:02.380> do<00:04:02.530> want<00:04:02.740> to

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:02.800 
those and I'll actually you do want to

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:05.430 
those and I'll actually you do want to
to<00:04:03.010> realize<00:04:03.310> that<00:04:03.670> this<00:04:04.330> thing<00:04:04.390> even<00:04:05.050> when

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:05.440 
to realize that this thing even when

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:08.400 
to realize that this thing even when
this<00:04:05.590> is<00:04:05.800> off<00:04:06.040> the<00:04:06.459> pin<00:04:06.670> switches<00:04:07.090> off<00:04:07.300> it<00:04:08.050> will

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:08.410 
this is off the pin switches off it will

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:11.760 
this is off the pin switches off it will
pull<00:04:08.770> I<00:04:09.300> think<00:04:10.300> one<00:04:10.600> ounce<00:04:10.750> or<00:04:11.260> something<00:04:11.650> like

something<00:04:43.020> that<00:04:43.230> I<00:04:43.260> was<00:04:43.560> reading<00:04:43.890> on<00:04:44.040> and

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:44.490 
something that I was reading on and

something that I was reading on and
realizing<00:04:45.090> that<00:04:45.120> that'd<00:04:45.360> be<00:04:45.480> a<00:04:45.510> good<00:04:45.630> idea

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:45.990 
realizing that that'd be a good idea

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:48.970 
realizing that that'd be a good idea
and<00:04:46.230> they<00:04:46.980> do<00:04:47.040> put<00:04:47.340> switches<00:04:47.700> in<00:04:47.820> here<00:04:48.090> but<00:04:48.270> the

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:48.980 
and they do put switches in here but the

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:53.180 
and they do put switches in here but the
switch<00:04:49.980> right<00:04:50.130> here<00:04:50.370> is<00:04:50.520> a<00:04:50.870> failsafe<00:04:51.870> it<00:04:52.350> once

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:53.190 
switch right here is a failsafe it once

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:55.850 
switch right here is a failsafe it once
that<00:04:53.430> once<00:04:54.180> you<00:04:54.330> take<00:04:54.540> it<00:04:54.690> out<00:04:54.860> it

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:55.860 
that once you take it out it

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:03.230 
that once you take it out it
automatically<00:05:02.000> automatically<00:05:03.000> makes

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:03.240 
automatically automatically makes

automatically automatically makes
contact<00:05:03.630> so<00:05:03.840> there's<00:05:04.020> no<00:05:04.850> mechanical<00:05:05.850> slide

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:06.150 
contact so there's no mechanical slide

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:07.340 
contact so there's no mechanical slide
or<00:05:06.480> anything<00:05:06.690> of<00:05:06.900> that<00:05:06.930> nature

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:07.350 
or anything of that nature

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:11.210 
or anything of that nature
in<00:05:07.560> here<00:05:08.160> it's<00:05:09.120> you<00:05:09.960> know<00:05:10.050> it's<00:05:10.620> there<00:05:10.920> and

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:11.220 
in here it's you know it's there and

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:14.440 
in here it's you know it's there and
then<00:05:11.940> you<00:05:12.210> could<00:05:12.330> probably<00:05:12.480> stop<00:05:12.810> it<00:05:12.990> instead

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:14.450 
then you could probably stop it instead

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:17.510 
then you could probably stop it instead
this<00:05:15.450> makes<00:05:15.720> up<00:05:15.930> little<00:05:16.200> little<00:05:16.890> deal<00:05:17.130> man<00:05:17.370> I

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:17.520 
this makes up little little deal man I

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:19.100 
this makes up little little deal man I
really<00:05:17.820> do<00:05:17.910> enjoy<00:05:18.060> it<00:05:18.360> so<00:05:18.540> hopefully<00:05:18.900> y'all
