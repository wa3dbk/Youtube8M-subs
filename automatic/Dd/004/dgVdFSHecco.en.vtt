okay you hear squid squid but if I hold
it<00:01:12.380> like<00:01:12.650> this<00:01:12.680> exactly<00:01:13.220> the<00:01:13.430> contrary

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:13.850 
it like this exactly the contrary

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:16.900 
it like this exactly the contrary
position<00:01:15.010> then<00:01:16.010> you<00:01:16.220> will<00:01:16.400> get<00:01:16.520> another

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:16.910 
position then you will get another

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:23.830 
position then you will get another
sample<00:01:17.330> which<00:01:17.690> is<00:01:17.870> clunk<00:01:18.290> clunk<00:01:22.720> which<00:01:23.720> is

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:23.840 
sample which is clunk clunk which is

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.560 
sample which is clunk clunk which is
interesting<00:01:24.440> too<00:01:24.650> but<00:01:24.890> it's<00:01:25.550> your<00:01:26.090> call<00:01:26.360> to

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:26.570 
interesting too but it's your call to

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:31.150 
interesting too but it's your call to
choose<00:01:27.250> how<00:01:28.250> to<00:01:28.280> use<00:01:28.610> them<00:01:28.880> the<00:01:30.010> angle<00:01:31.010> from

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:31.160 
choose how to use them the angle from

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:32.950 
choose how to use them the angle from
your<00:01:31.250> right<00:01:31.580> hand<00:01:31.910> the<00:01:32.120> strength<00:01:32.450> should<00:01:32.780> be

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:32.960 
your right hand the strength should be

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:37.120 
your right hand the strength should be
about<00:01:33.320> 45<00:01:33.830> degrees<00:01:34.630> like<00:01:35.630> this<00:01:36.010> because<00:01:37.010> this

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.130 
about 45 degrees like this because this

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:40.830 
about 45 degrees like this because this
angle<00:01:37.580> will<00:01:37.760> allow<00:01:38.000> you<00:01:38.060> to<00:01:38.240> switch<00:01:38.800> from<00:01:39.800> the

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 
angle will allow you to switch from the

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.670 
angle will allow you to switch from the
switch<00:01:41.840> which<00:01:42.140> sound<00:01:42.500> the<00:01:43.010> plane<00:01:44.350> very<00:01:45.350> easily

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:45.680 
switch which sound the plane very easily

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.150 
switch which sound the plane very easily
and<00:01:46.100> you<00:01:46.940> put<00:01:47.420> your<00:01:47.600> right<00:01:47.780> hand<00:01:47.860> right<00:01:48.860> on<00:01:48.890> the

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:49.160 
and you put your right hand right on the

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:51.460 
and you put your right hand right on the
bridge<00:01:49.400> of<00:01:49.430> the<00:01:49.760> guitar<00:01:49.970> and<00:01:50.870> you're<00:01:51.110> ready<00:01:51.290> to

first thing but I've been observing a
many<00:02:00.740> tracing<00:02:01.430> that<00:02:02.000> you<00:02:02.180> should<00:02:02.330> not<00:02:02.570> hold<00:02:03.320> a

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:03.470 
many tracing that you should not hold a

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:07.090 
many tracing that you should not hold a
pig<00:02:03.710> like<00:02:03.890> this<00:02:04.190> I<00:02:04.400> mean<00:02:05.650> with<00:02:06.650> your<00:02:06.800> thumb

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.100

pig like this I mean with your thumb
unto<00:02:07.970> you<00:02:08.119> the<00:02:08.690> fangs<00:02:09.110> of<00:02:09.230> your<00:02:09.470> index<00:02:10.010> like

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:10.489 
unto you the fangs of your index like

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:13.630 
unto you the fangs of your index like
this<00:02:10.810> because<00:02:11.980> like<00:02:12.980> this<00:02:13.160> you<00:02:13.310> will<00:02:13.430> have

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
this because like this you will have

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.820 
this because like this you will have
little<00:02:13.790> strength<00:02:14.239> but<00:02:15.170> you<00:02:15.290> will<00:02:15.440> lose<00:02:15.620> a<00:02:15.650> lot

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
little strength but you will lose a lot

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.270 
little strength but you will lose a lot
of<00:02:15.980> accuracy<00:02:16.280> and<00:02:16.850> comfort<00:02:17.570> I<00:02:17.690> think<00:02:18.280> I've

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
of accuracy and comfort I think I've

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.430 
of accuracy and comfort I think I've
also<00:02:19.580> seen<00:02:19.910> many<00:02:19.970> players<00:02:20.450> holding<00:02:21.020> the<00:02:21.200> pig

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
also seen many players holding the pig

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.300 
also seen many players holding the pig
like<00:02:21.739> this<00:02:22.040> I<00:02:22.310> mean<00:02:23.350> you<00:02:24.350> see<00:02:24.590> something<00:02:25.220> like

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
like this I mean you see something like

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:28.960 
like this I mean you see something like
this<00:02:25.459> I<00:02:25.610> think<00:02:25.670> and<00:02:27.040> absolutely<00:02:28.040> you<00:02:28.160> just

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
this I think and absolutely you just

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:30.970 
this I think and absolutely you just
ring<00:02:29.239> them<00:02:29.360> up<00:02:29.480> like<00:02:29.780> this<00:02:29.989> so<00:02:30.230> I<00:02:30.470> don't<00:02:30.620> think

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
ring them up like this so I don't think

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.970 
ring them up like this so I don't think
it's<00:02:31.130> a<00:02:31.220> good<00:02:31.400> way<00:02:31.610> of<00:02:31.640> holding<00:02:31.970> the<00:02:32.209> pig<00:02:32.980> about

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
it's a good way of holding the pig about

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:34.840 
it's a good way of holding the pig about
the<00:02:34.100> right<00:02:34.280> hand

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:34.850 
the right hand

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:37.900 
the right hand
I've<00:02:35.180> seen<00:02:35.480> many<00:02:35.690> get<00:02:35.900> erased<00:02:36.170> putting<00:02:37.040> one

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 
I've seen many get erased putting one

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:39.699 
I've seen many get erased putting one
finger<00:02:38.330> onto<00:02:38.510> the<00:02:38.750> table<00:02:39.110> of<00:02:39.170> the<00:02:39.200> guitar<00:02:39.560> like

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:39.709 
finger onto the table of the guitar like

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:41.830 
finger onto the table of the guitar like
this<00:02:39.769> finger<00:02:40.160> of<00:02:40.400> this<00:02:40.519> finger<00:02:40.940> because<00:02:41.720> they

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
this finger of this finger because they

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.509 
this finger of this finger because they
think<00:02:41.900> that<00:02:42.170> we<00:02:42.320> get<00:02:42.470> better<00:02:42.739> as<00:02:43.040> you<00:02:43.130> raise<00:02:43.310> it

00:02:43.509 --> 00:02:43.519 
think that we get better as you raise it

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:45.699 
think that we get better as you raise it
like<00:02:43.550> this<00:02:43.820> but<00:02:44.570> I<00:02:44.600> think<00:02:44.870> it's<00:02:44.989> a<00:02:45.050> mistake<00:02:45.170> too

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:45.709 
like this but I think it's a mistake too

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:48.759 
like this but I think it's a mistake too
because<00:02:46.580> it<00:02:46.760> prevents<00:02:47.300> the<00:02:47.989> arm<00:02:48.260> the<00:02:48.530> wrist

00:02:48.759 --> 00:02:48.769 
because it prevents the arm the wrist

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:51.370 
because it prevents the arm the wrist
from<00:02:49.550> following<00:02:49.850> the<00:02:50.540> motion<00:02:50.750> of<00:02:51.019> the<00:02:51.140> hem

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:51.380 
from following the motion of the hem

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:55.090 
from following the motion of the hem
when<00:02:51.769> you<00:02:51.890> go<00:02:52.190> up<00:02:52.430> and<00:02:52.550> down<00:02:52.610> like<00:02:53.209> this<00:02:53.830> if<00:02:54.830> you

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:55.100 
when you go up and down like this if you

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:57.910 
when you go up and down like this if you
keep<00:02:55.550> your<00:02:55.760> finger<00:02:56.060> relaxed<00:02:56.480> then<00:02:57.290> it<00:02:57.739> will

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
keep your finger relaxed then it will

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:01.750 
keep your finger relaxed then it will
allow<00:02:58.160> you<00:02:58.220> to<00:02:59.260> follow<00:03:00.260> the<00:03:00.500> motion<00:03:01.190> so<00:03:01.580> the

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
allow you to follow the motion so the

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.190 
allow you to follow the motion so the
last<00:03:01.940> advice<00:03:02.269> it<00:03:02.510> that<00:03:02.660> I<00:03:02.750> could<00:03:02.959> give<00:03:03.170> you

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
last advice it that I could give you

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:04.810 
last advice it that I could give you
