00:00:10.569 --> 00:00:15.729
 furthermore 4 with the service filing folder which our filing folder or briefly 

00:00:15.729 --> 00:00:18.349
 said expanded in the cache so far 

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:21.739
 that information we copy to the cache for example 

00:00:21.739 --> 00:00:22.390
 a text 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:23.949
 Override ZEB 

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:27.499
 also be available on a remote controlled PC 

00:00:27.499 --> 00:00:30.409
 But he is only expecting the feature if we have the windows 

00:00:30.409 --> 00:00:33.409
 Possibility to use remote PC access 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.390
 should you use any other software, so does the possibility 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:41.500
 sixth or information about the cache on one 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.790
 Remote PC just move from the corresponding 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:45.750
 Software off 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.239
 Among other things, we use the VNC software in our network 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:54.289
 and that has the feature as well, and even if that's what they're saying now 

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:56.120
 must be switched off 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.590
 as in this case it could still be done via VNC 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:02.080
 Memory information is between speaker information 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:04.190
 easily transferred 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:06.470
 insofar as they are not 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:08.580
 remotely control other PCs 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.540
 or if then maybe you do not have the microsoft software then you can 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.540
 switch off this service easily 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:22.510
 Next come the event system service a communication channel 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:24.300
 Programs among each other 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.390
 also not much to say must be turned on 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:31.210
 On going to service computer browsers 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:35.350
 Also important if we have multiple computers with Windows in one 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:36.810
 network 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.159
 and in these over windows with gaps quotes exchange data 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.970
 So data exchange between computers is of course always for 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.250
 Example via FDP access possible 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.140
 but if, for example, with the normal explorer to another 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:54.240
 Want to access computers then they need, among other things, this sentence 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.620
 if you only have one computer then that is completely unimportant to her 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:02.620
 and then you can use this service 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.060
 we come to founding 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.469
 interface 

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:12.149
 do you have 

00:02:12.149 --> 00:02:13.769
 Photography services 

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:17.849
 Microsoft provides a troop interface to foreign application 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:21.209
 When I'm in front of me Owen and I want to make a lot of work 

00:02:21.919 --> 00:02:24.080
 then i could use this interface 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:25.540
 need and use 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.230
 Of course they can not switch off and there is one 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.329
 Installation routine which also access it 

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:34.900
 that was usually annoying because if you had shut them off then you could 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.599
 one does not connect so quickly between the installation routine Rainer 

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:39.929
 games-software 

00:02:39.929 --> 00:02:42.929
 and just this group interface 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:48.480
 Often, however, the application itself is capable of this service 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:49.570
 turn 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:52.210
 so far you do not have to have it turned on 

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:55.939
 it is often enough to just set the switch to manual 

00:02:55.939 --> 00:02:59.409
 if an application needs it then can turn itself on 

00:03:03.649 --> 00:03:07.779
 should they be the Windows from December is that already in another video 

00:03:07.779 --> 00:03:09.039
 have spoken 

00:03:09.039 --> 00:03:13.109
 Actively use that means the always runs and asks on the Internet daily 

00:03:13.619 --> 00:03:17.469
 After Appelts on the internet then they have to service this troupe 

00:03:17.469 --> 00:03:21.729
 be activated or have started in any case because without the 

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:26.480
 Started Clubtour service may not work correctly 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:32.789
 Commerce last for this video to the DHCP client 

00:03:32.789 --> 00:03:34.729
 Hello 

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:38.959
 since watching this video they will be on the internet and so if they are 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:42.000
 strictly speaking, it also maintains its own network 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.139
 it is only possible that they are the only one in this network 

00:03:45.139 --> 00:03:48.379
 just in case they just have this one computer 

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:52.290
 In any case, the computer has received a so-called a key 

00:03:53.219 --> 00:03:57.229
 You can fix it with a Kiwi, so fix it up 

00:03:57.229 --> 00:03:59.949
 Meaning of fixed 

00:03:59.949 --> 00:04:01.269
 or but 

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:03.689
 this is easier for most users 

00:04:03.689 --> 00:04:06.939
 in their ground or in their router is still a dhcp server 

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:08.950
 integrated 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:14.420
 and this the HCP server has them or their computer one 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:16.359
 Alpine assigned 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:20.370
 In the latter case, they have no fixed rule, then they have to 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:22.270
 Number is on hold 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:24.050
 because otherwise gets 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:25.849
 her computer also no 

00:04:25.849 --> 00:04:28.080
 a PID 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.689
 and then they can not go online though 

00:04:30.689 --> 00:04:32.759
 Network with foresters we have 

00:04:32.759 --> 00:04:35.759
 then you can switch off this sentence easily it would be 

00:04:36.279 --> 00:04:37.789
 Grozer just about it 

00:04:37.789 --> 00:04:40.819
 that their calculator a so-called a beeper too 

00:04:40.819 --> 00:04:44.710
 and if they did not enter in any of the DHCPs 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:46.169
 it is true 

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:47.420
 should if you have this 

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:50.900
 which must turn off this DHCP client 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:55.759
 then your PC can not accept Alpine from the dhcp server 

00:04:55.759 --> 00:04:57.219
 that will be pretty bad
