basically<00:01:02.170> it's<00:01:02.469> a<00:01:02.530> whole<00:01:02.649> project<00:01:02.860> you're

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:03.430 
basically it's a whole project you're

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:05.069 
basically it's a whole project you're
gonna<00:01:03.520> have<00:01:03.730> to<00:01:03.850> figure<00:01:04.059> out<00:01:04.210> how<00:01:04.659> you<00:01:04.719> want

00:01:05.069 --> 00:01:05.079 
gonna have to figure out how you want

00:01:05.079 --> 00:01:07.410 
gonna have to figure out how you want
the<00:01:05.229> design<00:01:05.619> to<00:01:05.649> look<00:01:06.520> now<00:01:06.880> you<00:01:06.939> can<00:01:07.210> go<00:01:07.360> off

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:07.420 
the design to look now you can go off

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:12.029 
the design to look now you can go off
mine<00:01:07.780> or<00:01:08.109> go<00:01:09.009> online<00:01:09.189> and<00:01:09.850> look<00:01:10.090> at<00:01:10.209> hers<00:01:11.039> but

00:01:12.029 --> 00:01:12.039 
mine or go online and look at hers but

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:14.010 
mine or go online and look at hers but
the<00:01:12.579> whole<00:01:12.729> thing<00:01:12.999> is<00:01:13.209> the<00:01:13.420> design<00:01:13.600> and<00:01:13.959> I

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:14.020 
the whole thing is the design and I

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:16.469 
the whole thing is the design and I
can't<00:01:14.319> really<00:01:14.469> show<00:01:15.280> you<00:01:15.310> how<00:01:15.909> to<00:01:15.969> do<00:01:16.270> the

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:16.479 
can't really show you how to do the

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:18.929 
can't really show you how to do the
design<00:01:16.810> but<00:01:17.380> here's<00:01:17.649> a<00:01:17.740> little<00:01:17.950> example<00:01:18.189> to<00:01:18.789> do

00:01:18.929 --> 00:01:18.939 
design but here's a little example to do

00:01:18.939 --> 00:01:21.209 
design but here's a little example to do
that<00:01:19.119> so<00:01:19.569> now<00:01:20.049> that<00:01:20.109> you<00:01:20.350> know<00:01:20.380> that<00:01:20.679> we<00:01:21.009> can

00:01:21.209 --> 00:01:21.219 
that so now that you know that we can

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:24.989 
that so now that you know that we can
get<00:01:21.340> started<00:01:21.869> okay<00:01:22.869> step<00:01:23.200> one<00:01:23.229> is<00:01:23.709> to<00:01:24.009> cut<00:01:24.369> your

00:01:24.989 --> 00:01:24.999 
get started okay step one is to cut your

00:01:24.999 --> 00:01:27.840 
get started okay step one is to cut your
design<00:01:25.299> into<00:01:25.749> the<00:01:25.840> vinyl<00:01:26.049> now<00:01:26.679> what<00:01:27.399> I<00:01:27.429> did<00:01:27.670> is

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:27.850 
design into the vinyl now what I did is

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:30.269 
design into the vinyl now what I did is
I<00:01:27.939> cut<00:01:28.149> half<00:01:28.509> of<00:01:28.810> this<00:01:29.020> design<00:01:29.380> and<00:01:29.619> then<00:01:30.249> I

00:01:30.269 --> 00:01:30.279 
I cut half of this design and then I

00:01:30.279 --> 00:01:33.149 
I cut half of this design and then I
folded<00:01:30.969> it<00:01:31.119> in<00:01:31.329> half<00:01:31.359> and<00:01:31.929> then<00:01:32.380> I'm<00:01:32.499> going<00:01:32.859> to

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:33.159 
folded it in half and then I'm going to

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:36.899 
folded it in half and then I'm going to
cut<00:01:33.999> it<00:01:34.329> so<00:01:35.289> when<00:01:35.889> you<00:01:36.009> do<00:01:36.159> that<00:01:36.189> and<00:01:36.520> fold<00:01:36.789> in

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:36.909 
cut it so when you do that and fold in

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:38.760 
cut it so when you do that and fold in
half<00:01:37.090> and<00:01:37.329> then<00:01:37.420> cut<00:01:37.450> the<00:01:37.749> other<00:01:37.899> half<00:01:37.990> then

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:38.770 
half and then cut the other half then

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:42.660 
half and then cut the other half then
they're<00:01:39.249> both<00:01:39.549> perfectly<00:01:40.240> even<00:01:40.719> and<00:01:41.369> yeah<00:01:42.369> so

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:42.670 
they're both perfectly even and yeah so

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:46.720 
they're both perfectly even and yeah so
cut<00:01:42.999> it

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:46.730 

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:48.950 

so<00:01:47.730> this<00:01:47.970> is<00:01:48.120> what<00:01:48.270> it<00:01:48.360> looks<00:01:48.510> like<00:01:48.630> when<00:01:48.810> it's

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
so this is what it looks like when it's

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.500 
so this is what it looks like when it's
cut<00:01:49.190> okay<00:01:50.190> so<00:01:50.250> the<00:01:50.550> next<00:01:50.760> step<00:01:50.910> is<00:01:51.060> to<00:01:51.240> put<00:01:51.420> in

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:51.510 
cut okay so the next step is to put in

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:54.800 
cut okay so the next step is to put in
straight<00:01:51.780> pins<00:01:52.400> so<00:01:53.400> we<00:01:53.580> can<00:01:53.850> get<00:01:54.210> ready<00:01:54.420> to<00:01:54.600> sew

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
straight pins so we can get ready to sew

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.880 
straight pins so we can get ready to sew
it<00:01:54.990> and<00:01:55.020> get<00:01:55.380> the<00:01:55.500> shape<00:01:55.710> down<00:01:55.920> and<00:01:56.280> then<00:01:56.430> also

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:57.890 
it and get the shape down and then also

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.410 
it and get the shape down and then also
put<00:01:58.890> in<00:01:59.040> straight<00:01:59.220> pins<00:01:59.490> so<00:01:59.700> we<00:01:59.820> can<00:02:00.000> cut<00:02:00.210> more

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
put in straight pins so we can cut more

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:01.760 
put in straight pins so we can cut more
of<00:02:00.480> it<00:02:00.660> off<00:02:00.750> because<00:02:00.930> as<00:02:01.170> you<00:02:01.320> can<00:02:01.440> see<00:02:01.650> the

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
of it off because as you can see the

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.970 
of it off because as you can see the
arms<00:02:02.130> aren't<00:02:02.280> done<00:02:02.580> and<00:02:03.350> yeah<00:02:04.350> so<00:02:04.620> we'll<00:02:04.770> put

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:04.980 
arms aren't done and yeah so we'll put

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:07.220 
arms aren't done and yeah so we'll put
