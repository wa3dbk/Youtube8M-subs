00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.880
[JUNGBUB TALK] 0120. A Man with a Harsh Fate

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:05.000
[Jungbub Terminology]
Grand Nature: the whole-dimensional Universe
Jungbub: ‘the Righteous Law’ in Korean, the law of Grand Nature
Seuseungnim: the Great Mentor who gives out the law of Grand Nature

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:13.040
We describe someone who has endured extreme difficulties in life with the expression, “A person who has gone through many battles in the mountains and the sea.” in Korean. Why is it that this person is born with such harsh fate?

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:17.580
That is an interesting question.

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.740
We say that a person has been through many battles in the mountains, the sea, and the sky etc.,

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:24.100
to describe one’s extreme hardship in life.

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:35.120
The reason for that person to experience a lot of events in life is to be provided a chance to study.

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:42.280
You are induced to study by having many experiences in the world.

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:47.380
However, if you step into the world without knowing the basic principle,

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:55.100
you cannot learn from your environment properly, thereby, you would just end up experiencing them with nothing gained.

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:02.500
For example, let’s say your job is a candy seller.

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.920
The job requires you to move around to sell.

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:13.000
This means you are given a chance to visit every corner of the cities to sell candies,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:24.860
meet many citizens there and learn thoroughly about the towns.

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:29.760
Isn’t a candy seller a perfect job to have this kind of learning opportunity?

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:36.540
In the same vein, a job of collecting and selling junk allows you to explore parts of the neighborhood not easily seen.

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:44.880
Living in that condition, you are able to learn and absorb extraordinary things.

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:52.240
Without knowing this fact, you may mock at how menial your job is.

00:01:52.240 --> 00:02:07.180
If the candy seller can utilize his wide experience into making a righteous future plan for his own life,

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:12.560
he would be able to achieve great things.

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.260
This means he wasn’t merely roaming around towns to sell candies,

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:31.560
but analyzed the towns and the people living there by absorbing their qualities of energy as a whole information.

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:38.680
He wouldn’t need to study “the book of Changes” for he will be able to read the world already.

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.280
If he had known this basic principle and sincerely studied from town to town,

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:47.920
and wrote down his experience on his daily journal,

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:53.760
he would have become one of the best among PhD holders.

00:02:53.760 --> 00:03:02.940
Unlimited resources are given to his study, such as correlation of local water with the local people’s skin,

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:08.540
how the local people’s characteristics change due to breeding certain livestock in this area and so on.

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:18.240
You have no idea how unlimited the knowledge can be taught by correctly utilizing the environment presented to us.

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:22.120
You just didn’t know how to.

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:28.060
Without knowing this basic law,

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:37.160
a junk dealer has dealt with junk for 30 years straight, only minding how much the metal is, or the copper is.

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:49.580
Can you imagine just how wide the gap will be between a life of a seller knowing this basic law,

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:58.200
and which of another without knowing this basic law?

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:03.320
It is as far apart as the distance from heavens to earth.

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:11.940
Under the same condition, one is now capable to lead the world with great insight,

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.520
needed by all,

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:30.600
while the other still chases after a piece of copper commenting that rubber has no monetary value anymore.

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:33.300
There will be a big gap.

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:40.960
You will have a better understanding as you study the lectures later on,

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:48.560
and think about the kind of environment Grand Nature has provided to me.

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:56.100
The condition has been given to this Great Mentor with all sorts of experience from the harsh reality.

00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:04.940
This Great Mentor is someone who has been through everything from selling newspaper and gums to shoe shining,

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:13.140
neither born with wealth, nor raised with the support of any parents.

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:19.100
In the gloomy days of when World War II and the Korean War have ended,

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:35.900
this Great Mentor has
been thrown out into the world to survive alone.

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:37.860
Do not judge your condition.

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:43.220
The condition provided to you is the most valuable gift presented by Grand Nature.

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:49.760
All the proper conditions have been provided so that you can live a righteous life,

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:54.760
but you had no knowledge of such basic.

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:59.340
The condition given to you is the best provided to you, for living your life to the fullest.

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:00.920
So do not ever complain.

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:05.760
The more you complain, the more difficulties you will face in life,

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:11.980
and consequently, the harder condition it is for you to find study.

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:16.360
Grand Nature has always been righteous and fair when providing you with a condition;

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:21.520
it was neither advantageous nor disadvantageous, but a fair one.

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:24.520
Whether you are born rich or poor,

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:29.440
you will have a great life if you wisely utilize your conditions.

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:37.180
However, if you distrust your given condition and complain about it,

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:46.420
you will be painfully aware of your situation as your condition in life goes downhill from that moment.
