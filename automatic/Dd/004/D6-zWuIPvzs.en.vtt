show<00:01:09.000> you<00:01:09.030> all<00:01:09.150> that<00:01:09.360> so<00:01:09.960> how<00:01:10.260> to<00:01:10.320> craft<00:01:10.590> these

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
show you all that so how to craft these

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.950 
show you all that so how to craft these
arrows<00:01:11.130> are<00:01:11.280> really<00:01:11.490> simple<00:01:11.729> on<00:01:12.119> all<00:01:12.479> of<00:01:12.840> them

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
arrows are really simple on all of them

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.870 
arrows are really simple on all of them
say<00:01:13.140> like<00:01:13.350> dirt<00:01:13.590> arrow<00:01:13.830> torch<00:01:14.310> air<00:01:14.460> all<00:01:14.729> this

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
say like dirt arrow torch air all this

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.580 
say like dirt arrow torch air all this
stuff<00:01:15.090> so<00:01:15.330> for<00:01:15.600> example<00:01:15.930> this<00:01:16.049> is<00:01:16.170> a<00:01:16.200> slime

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
stuff so for example this is a slime

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.499 
stuff so for example this is a slime
arrow<00:01:16.860> as<00:01:17.130> you<00:01:17.280> can<00:01:17.400> see<00:01:17.549> now<00:01:18.000> you<00:01:18.030> would<00:01:18.270> craft

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
arrow as you can see now you would craft

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.420 
arrow as you can see now you would craft
it<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:18.869> same<00:01:19.110> way<00:01:19.290> you<00:01:19.320> craft<00:01:19.740> a<00:01:19.920> normal<00:01:20.220> arrow

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
it the same way you craft a normal arrow

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.280 
it the same way you craft a normal arrow
with<00:01:20.670> feathers<00:01:21.060> and<00:01:21.210> a<00:01:21.299> stick<00:01:21.570> but<00:01:21.960> instead<00:01:22.200> of

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
with feathers and a stick but instead of

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:23.749 
with feathers and a stick but instead of
using<00:01:22.470> Flint<00:01:22.890> for<00:01:23.100> this<00:01:23.250> one<00:01:23.430> you<00:01:23.610> would<00:01:23.729> use

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
using Flint for this one you would use

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.340 
using Flint for this one you would use
slime<00:01:24.240> and<00:01:24.540> for<00:01:24.720> this<00:01:24.780> one<00:01:24.960> you<00:01:25.080> would<00:01:25.140> use<00:01:25.200> a

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
slime and for this one you would use a

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:26.840 
slime and for this one you would use a
torch<00:01:25.680> and<00:01:25.890> stuff<00:01:26.070> like<00:01:26.189> that<00:01:26.400> and<00:01:26.759> these

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
torch and stuff like that and these

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.850 
torch and stuff like that and these
arrows<00:01:27.090> will<00:01:27.330> do<00:01:27.479> different<00:01:27.840> things<00:01:27.869> like<00:01:28.229> for

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
arrows will do different things like for

you can see we can just shoot it and it

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.610 
you can see we can just shoot it and it
puts<00:03:02.159> down<00:03:02.220> these<00:03:02.609> awesome<00:03:03.359> awesome<00:03:03.629> little

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620

puts down these awesome awesome little
things<00:03:04.859> so<00:03:05.099> that's<00:03:05.220> actually<00:03:05.489> really<00:03:06.420> really

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:07.109 
things so that's actually really really

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:10.009

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:10.019 
cool as you can see so let's test it on

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:11.690 
cool as you can see so let's test it on
something<00:03:10.290> bigger<00:03:10.709> why<00:03:10.980> don't<00:03:11.159> we<00:03:11.280> fly

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
something bigger why don't we fly

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.839 
something bigger why don't we fly
actually<00:03:12.560> I'm<00:03:13.560> not<00:03:13.859> sure<00:03:14.220> what<00:03:14.489> we<00:03:14.579> can<00:03:14.700> test

00:03:14.839 --> 00:03:14.849 
actually I'm not sure what we can test

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:16.130 
actually I'm not sure what we can test
it<00:03:14.970> on<00:03:15.060> we<00:03:15.209> can<00:03:15.329> test<00:03:15.480> it<00:03:15.569> on<00:03:15.720> maybe<00:03:15.900> this

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
it on we can test it on maybe this

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:17.930 
it on we can test it on maybe this
mountain<00:03:16.560> maybe<00:03:16.739> these<00:03:16.980> steep<00:03:17.340> cliffs<00:03:17.730> over

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
mountain maybe these steep cliffs over

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:19.640 
mountain maybe these steep cliffs over
here<00:03:18.120> so<00:03:18.329> let's<00:03:18.480> do<00:03:18.690> that<00:03:18.870> I<00:03:19.109> think<00:03:19.380> that<00:03:19.530> would

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
here so let's do that I think that would

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:22.280 
here so let's do that I think that would
be<00:03:19.709> really<00:03:20.040> cool<00:03:20.250> okay<00:03:21.120> so<00:03:21.180> first<00:03:21.720> let's

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
be really cool okay so first let's

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.500 
be really cool okay so first let's
actually<00:03:22.440> change<00:03:22.829> the<00:03:23.160> time<00:03:23.459> real<00:03:24.299> quick

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
actually change the time real quick

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.089 
actually change the time real quick
sorry<00:03:24.810> about<00:03:25.079> that<00:03:25.109> I'm<00:03:25.650> gonna<00:03:25.769> go<00:03:25.889> ahead<00:03:25.950> and

00:03:26.089 --> 00:03:26.099 
sorry about that I'm gonna go ahead and

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:27.409 
sorry about that I'm gonna go ahead and
change<00:03:26.250> that<00:03:26.340> and<00:03:26.579> I<00:03:26.609> guess<00:03:26.760> we<00:03:26.880> can<00:03:26.910> try<00:03:27.359> it

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:27.419 
change that and I guess we can try it

00:03:27.419 --> 00:03:29.659 
change that and I guess we can try it
right<00:03:27.540> here<00:03:28.109> but<00:03:28.560> I'm<00:03:28.680> actually<00:03:28.829> going<00:03:29.190> to<00:03:29.370> go

00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:29.669 
right here but I'm actually going to go

00:03:29.669 --> 00:03:33.860 
right here but I'm actually going to go
into<00:03:31.340> survival<00:03:32.340> so<00:03:32.730> it<00:03:33.150> would<00:03:33.329> be<00:03:33.480> like<00:03:33.660> is

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
into survival so it would be like is

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:35.690 
into survival so it would be like is
we're<00:03:34.290> actually<00:03:34.470> surviving<00:03:35.310> so<00:03:35.430> let's<00:03:35.579> go

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
we're actually surviving so let's go

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.610 
we're actually surviving so let's go
ahead<00:03:35.790> and<00:03:36.060> throw<00:03:36.239> an<00:03:36.389> arrow<00:03:36.569> right<00:03:37.319> there<00:03:37.349> at

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
ahead and throw an arrow right there at

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:40.550 
ahead and throw an arrow right there at
the<00:03:37.709> top<00:03:38.010> maybe<00:03:38.340> we<00:03:38.549> missed<00:03:38.879> and<00:03:39.329> there<00:03:40.290> we<00:03:40.440> go

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
the top maybe we missed and there we go

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:41.750 
the top maybe we missed and there we go
there's<00:03:40.799> one<00:03:40.950> right<00:03:41.099> there<00:03:41.370> and<00:03:41.400> then<00:03:41.669> we're

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
there's one right there and then we're

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.580 
there's one right there and then we're
gonna<00:03:41.879> need<00:03:42.000> another<00:03:42.090> one<00:03:42.389> right<00:03:42.930> here

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
gonna need another one right here

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.530 
gonna need another one right here
that'll<00:03:44.430> work<00:03:44.549> and<00:03:44.819> then<00:03:44.910> another<00:03:45.090> one<00:03:45.329> right

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
that'll work and then another one right

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.140 
that'll work and then another one right
here<00:03:46.019> I'm<00:03:46.560> I<00:03:46.680> need<00:03:46.739> one<00:03:47.010> right<00:03:47.040> there

here I'm I need one right there
nope<00:03:48.389> I<00:03:48.599> think<00:03:49.139> this<00:03:49.260> might<00:03:49.410> work<00:03:49.470> well<00:03:49.799> so

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
nope I think this might work well so

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.050 
nope I think this might work well so
