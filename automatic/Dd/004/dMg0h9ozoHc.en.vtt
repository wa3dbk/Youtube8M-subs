organic<00:01:14.010> I<00:01:14.220> do<00:01:14.460> think<00:01:14.820> it's<00:01:14.970> important<00:01:15.450> to<00:01:15.509> go

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
organic I do think it's important to go

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.560 
organic I do think it's important to go
the<00:01:16.080> extra<00:01:16.110> organic<00:01:16.710> mile<00:01:17.009> if<00:01:17.369> you<00:01:17.729> can<00:01:18.000> when

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
the extra organic mile if you can when

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.390 
the extra organic mile if you can when
you're<00:01:18.720> buying<00:01:18.900> canned<00:01:19.290> foods<00:01:19.650> because<00:01:20.189> the

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
you're buying canned foods because the

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.490 
you're buying canned foods because the
cost<00:01:20.670> is<00:01:20.970> really<00:01:21.299> not<00:01:21.450> that<00:01:21.720> much<00:01:21.960> difference

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
cost is really not that much difference

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.800 
cost is really not that much difference
and<00:01:22.729> the<00:01:23.729> organic<00:01:24.090> really<00:01:24.420> does<00:01:24.570> make<00:01:24.750> a

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
and the organic really does make a

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.240 
and the organic really does make a
difference<00:01:25.080> reducing<00:01:25.799> your<00:01:25.890> risk<00:01:25.950> of

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
difference reducing your risk of

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.480 
difference reducing your risk of
exposure<00:01:27.090> to<00:01:27.299> pesticides<00:01:27.770> especially<00:01:28.770> okay

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
exposure to pesticides especially okay

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.640 
exposure to pesticides especially okay
so<00:01:29.549> we're<00:01:29.670> going<00:01:29.759> to<00:01:29.850> stir<00:01:30.270> this<00:01:30.299> in<00:01:30.990> and<00:01:31.259> then

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
so we're going to stir this in and then

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.600 
so we're going to stir this in and then
we<00:01:31.770> are<00:01:31.920> going<00:01:32.009> to<00:01:32.100> also<00:01:32.310> add<00:01:32.759> 1<00:01:33.540> cup<00:01:34.100> 8<00:01:35.100> ounces

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610

let this all simmer for about three to
four<00:01:41.250> minutes<00:01:42.560> ok<00:01:43.560> so<00:01:43.619> the<00:01:43.799> sauce<00:01:44.009> is<00:01:44.250> simmered

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670

the health of the hen or the chicken is

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.080 
the health of the hen or the chicken is
really<00:01:55.649> what<00:01:55.920> most<00:01:56.219> determines<00:01:56.729> the<00:01:56.880> health

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
really what most determines the health

really what most determines the health
of<00:01:57.299> the<00:01:57.540> egg<00:01:57.689> so<00:01:58.320> we're<00:01:58.500> going<00:01:58.619> to<00:01:58.710> start<00:01:58.890> off

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
of the egg so we're going to start off

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.520 
of the egg so we're going to start off
by<00:01:59.310> using<00:01:59.579> a<00:02:00.240> whole<00:02:00.899> leg<00:02:01.079> we're<00:02:01.200> going<00:02:01.320> to<00:02:01.380> do

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
by using a whole leg we're going to do

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.950 
by using a whole leg we're going to do
six<00:02:01.860> whole<00:02:02.189> eggs<00:02:02.520> and<00:02:02.880> two<00:02:03.180> egg<00:02:03.420> whites<00:02:03.450> and

then we are going to add in the two egg
whites<00:02:45.739> and<00:02:46.130> don't<00:02:46.640> worry<00:02:46.850> so<00:02:47.030> much<00:02:47.090> about<00:02:47.209> the

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
whites and don't worry so much about the

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:49.750 
whites and don't worry so much about the
cholesterol<00:02:48.260> in<00:02:48.440> the<00:02:48.470> eggs<00:02:48.830> because<00:02:49.430> really

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
cholesterol in the eggs because really

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.460 
cholesterol in the eggs because really
what<00:02:50.000> affects<00:02:50.299> your<00:02:50.480> serum<00:02:51.019> or<00:02:51.140> your<00:02:51.260> blood

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470 
what affects your serum or your blood

what affects your serum or your blood
cholesterol<00:02:51.739> levels<00:02:51.980> is<00:02:52.420> saturated<00:02:53.420> fat

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:53.660 
cholesterol levels is saturated fat

flour<00:02:56.630> and<00:02:56.930> refined<00:02:57.410> sugar<00:02:57.739> actually<00:02:58.569> can<00:02:59.569> be

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
flour and refined sugar actually can be

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.870 
flour and refined sugar actually can be
converted<00:03:00.230> by<00:03:00.470> your<00:03:00.650> body<00:03:00.830> or<00:03:01.160> can<00:03:01.340> can

converted by your body or can can

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.710 
converted by your body or can can
increase<00:03:02.209> your<00:03:02.330> cholesterol<00:03:02.630> levels<00:03:03.200> because

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
increase your cholesterol levels because

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 
refined flour and refined sugar actually

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:10.390 
refined flour and refined sugar actually
activate<00:03:08.510> well<00:03:09.319> they<00:03:09.440> increase<00:03:09.920> your<00:03:10.040> insulin

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 
activate well they increase your insulin

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:11.949 
activate well they increase your insulin
levels<00:03:10.430> and<00:03:10.760> the<00:03:10.849> insulin<00:03:11.269> activates<00:03:11.810> the

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:11.959 
levels and the insulin activates the

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:13.300 
levels and the insulin activates the
main<00:03:12.140> enzyme<00:03:12.560> in<00:03:12.739> your<00:03:12.860> liver<00:03:13.040> that's

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
main enzyme in your liver that's

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:14.110 
main enzyme in your liver that's
responsible<00:03:13.760> for<00:03:13.970> manufacturing

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120 
responsible for manufacturing

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.110 
responsible for manufacturing
