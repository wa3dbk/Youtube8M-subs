00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 good kids jon try we are here 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.220
 in a new video of gta 5 and well then 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:06.960
 I can not speak very loudly because we are 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.160
 here at dawn but I wanted to tell you 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.380
 a little bit my first impressions 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.670
 about the game for pc that's good because 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.950
 I've been testing and such and the truth is 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.450
 that is incredible graphically is 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.539
 totally amazing as I expected 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:21.150
 even better the truth is that the 60's 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.880
 fps you notice a lot the game a lot 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.439
 more fluid and it looks much nicer 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.869
 and also because of the graphics they are quite 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.970
 superior to the console in both 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.579
 play 3 as play 4 or any 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.870
 generation then in pc is one more step 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.600
 forward not and the truth is that it shows 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.730
 much the difference and good as well as 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.620
 graphics and such incredible you will see it from 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.510
 background in the video and well it will look 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.149
 it really looks a lot better than what 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.860
 you are going to see yourselves in the video and good 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.750
 Well, the truth is that they have not flown 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.370
 I've had a little problem 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.629
 in linking the account as 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.489
 Well, it was there that did not start 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.289
 the game you already know that these first 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.630
 days there are always a lot of people the 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.940
 online is not going right now 

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:02.370
 and well, I was trying to link 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.559
 my life-long account that I use with 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.090
 the character of Mrs. forever 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.160
 I was giving 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.710
 tried with another email and hit me 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:12.420
 let's link it then I tried 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.030
 after linking it to link it 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.490
 with the main account has not left me 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.690
 it does not stop linking me then I do not know 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.030
 if we are going to be able to have the lady 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:23.550
 forever on pc or not the truth is that what 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.650
 I will try to see what happens but I do not know if 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:27.720
 with another email it will let me export the 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.460
 character that I have with the email 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.310
 principal then not good then it's a 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.600
 Fucked mess but good to tell you that my 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.590
 first impressions of the game for a 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:39.570
 very good times the truth what I do not 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.850
 pc like because that's what always 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.350
 has failed that if it costs you a lot 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.270
 that if the computer gives you a screenshot 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.830
 that if such but good I 've tried it 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.390
 butt graphics and the truth is that it 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:49.590
 look great 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.729
 much better than what you are going to see 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.470
 you in the background because surely 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.270
 even good I'm not going to make a video 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.060
 short so you can upload it to 60 fps 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.100
 is and that you can see it well worth and good 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.750
 well I will try to do the short 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.340
 because if it does not go 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.080
 It's going to take a lot to take a lot 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.790
 to go up if all that so well then 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.830
 I just want to see him one 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.270
 little bit of background that you think I would 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:11.910
 say for the comments the truth is 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.710
 that it shows or is quite noticeable 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.390
 graphic quality and that the game itself is 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:17.220
 the same as I said then in the video 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.860
 that went up earlier is the same as 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:23.070
 in all the consoles but that with more 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:25.500
 graphic quality the best performance 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:28.050
 I still do not dare not say it 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.970
 but yes, with 60 fps, 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:31.650
 they notice a lot the difference and it goes 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:33.720
 quite more fluid so nothing 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.150
 Well, if you're cool , you know 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.400
 catch him and so now here you have the 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.520
 first quality test so to speak 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.989
 in astral because I hope that you mole that 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:44.850
 what if that really gets like 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:47.130
 that's good so you put it at 60 fps that 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:49.140
 1080 I will upload it and nothing because they are cool 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:51.810
 and tell me for comments I'm going to go to 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:53.730
 play trying to connect to the online to 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.900
 see if I can and nothing costs again for 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.280
 that is not too long and what 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.209
 you can see well and all that and nothing then 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.209
 until the next goodbye
