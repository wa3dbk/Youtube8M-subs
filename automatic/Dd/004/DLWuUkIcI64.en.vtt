 Speak there youtube gamers here who speaks 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.349
 It's more of a zica and today for you it's just 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:19.140
 send a message giving a personal touch 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:21.270
 that unfortunately is again the 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.960
 hackers are getting stuck there on the pc like 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:27.269
 already spoiled several games and spoiled 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.150
 do not light they say so they cut them 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:32.430
 Way paths create a shortcut, right? 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:35.219
 for success or failure will be 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.620
 their thoughts are of today come and speak 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:40.500
 of the game that I like very much in which I 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:43.200
 I made videos from the channel and other colleagues 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:46.110
 mine also make it the dark souls but 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.600
 It's obvious that I'm a super part of eptc, right? 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.579
 is a greater facility to create hashish and 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.199
 this things 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:55.230
 so all that someone asks deep 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:57.989
 any in a pvp I had to 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.039
 It happens folks create a roof rack and 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.989
 several of us 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:04.049
 but I'll put the image on the screen here 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.129

 Patricia, I'm sad for this, huh? 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:31.439
 because even the number 1 was tight with 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:36.570
 an open game and press the number one 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:38.939
 You get to hp our infinite number 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.340

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.920
 infinite if I'm not mistaken, that's what I know 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.409

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.600
 infinite or you who killed yourself 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:58.530

 for the 3 né 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:50.760
 the idea of having such a thing 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.500

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.650

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:12.870

 For you guys, you deserve it. Congratulations. 

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:22.470
 I'm sad about who uses this program 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:25.320
 here but the program on the computer and your 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:27.600
 It's your game, you do what you want 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:29.550
 only when you come across pv p 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:33.180
 be careful when they hit number 1 or 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:37.170
 maybe bar number two or who knows right? 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:40.380
 suddenly hit the bar on number 

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:42.840
 six is ​​for you to stay with 99 humanity 

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:44.100
 and I saw that I was going to add a little more 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:46.620
 your defense 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:49.320
 So how boring are you suddenly? 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:51.960
 there it ran into number 6 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:53.670
 hey even richer and can not 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:56.340
 Generalization is not everyone's beauty 

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:58.860
 in everyone but I will know who is 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:01.290
 using, I will not be giving you the 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:05.580
 now I do not want to make it clear 

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:07.830
 For those who play it 's a pv and that has not changed. 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:09.480
 too much will change only if the guy wants 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:11.550
 use to make the item to stay there 

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:14.460
 and forth I do not see grace for it right 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:16.860
 because now I understand now I understand 

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:18.780
 Why did you say so, ah? 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:20.760
 david sousa a difficult game 

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:23.910
 When Jackson left he said he's a 

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:26.010
 Difficult game I found difficult at the time 

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:27.630
 I get to be difficult but that 

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:29.550
 our soldiers or difficult né 

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:32.400
 After you always left, you did everything. 

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:34.530
 That's it and we the hard is even right. 

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:36.570
 You do not know it 's normal, you do not know. 

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:38.730
 that is to create builds and gave to speak to 

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:41.370
 you do not really know what is the essence 

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:43.560
 of art souza and kill yourself to pick up items 

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:44.520
 So, I know that's what I went through. 

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:46.980
 therefore 

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:48.000
 so I'm better, right? 

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:50.910
 do what 

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:53.850
 if you do not know is lost then say 

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:55.770
 that's the best part of people 

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:57.780
 so I wanted to tell you that you like 

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:59.700
 shows we will never be able to finish 

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:02.670
 With that, I will not end the rats. 

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:05.130
 with schitz this is never going to end 

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:06.660
 But who are we to end, I'll say 

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:07.920
 what is right and wrong right? 

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:10.170
 so I decided to make this video here 

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:11.760
 prove to you that it exists if you 

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:14.580
 search for a program name and if not 

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:17.400
 to find very simple to find 

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:20.370
 if you want to use 11 but have in 

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:24.570
 mind that this is not a player I am 

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:26.910
 and that is you that but I do not use 

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:29.370
 pvp I only use for the pope promised to 

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:30.120
 I'm wrong the same way, right? 

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:32.730
 same way 

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:33.480
 but if you want to use the PCs and made 

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:34.770
 will 

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:37.320
 so I wanted to send a big hug 

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:39.630
 for all players the dark souls 

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:41.490
 I'll tell you the game again for players of 

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:43.680
 dark souls play 

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:44.910
 that guy hits his chest and goes 

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:46.979
 pharma item 

00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:49.020
 It's a big hug for you, thank you. 

00:06:46.979 --> 00:06:51.180
 by the force of always giving in the videos 

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:55.949
 my friends also make dark videos 

00:06:51.180 --> 00:07:00.440
 souls that strong hug and until the sea 

00:06:55.949 --> 00:07:00.440
 to assad leave saw speak for serving
