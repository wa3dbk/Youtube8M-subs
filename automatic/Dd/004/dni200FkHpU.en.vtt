00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.500
 The origin of the stomach pain 

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:07.000
 Due to the recent major earthquake 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
 The stomach of the original Fukushima Line’s stomach hurts. 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
 Ah~ah~ The stomach is sore! 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
 The stool seems to be coming out soon! 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.000
 The original stool is very stinky 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.500
 If it leaks, it will cause everyone's troubles. 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.500
 So the original king is desperately patient. 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:29.800
 but.... 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:30.800
 bump! 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.000
 The original monarch suddenly made a loud noise. 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
 Startled everyone 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
 It will not be the original stool of the stool leaked out! 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
 Immediately measure the odor around the original monarch 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
 I found that it is still not stinking. 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
 It turned out that it was not a stool, but a fart. 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
 But the original monarch’s stomach is still very painful. 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
 Be sure to do some treatment first. 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
 The doctors came to the original 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
 Feed the original monarch to take medicine 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
 The original medicine is seawater and boric acid. 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.500
 Different from humans 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.000
 The most important thing is to let the original fever go down first. 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.500
 If the medicine is not enough 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.500
 The original monarch will become very dangerous 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.000
 In order not to let the original king’s stool leak out 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
 The doctors tried to feed the original monarch to take medicine. 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.000
 Even though the original monarch was still careless fart. 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
 The smell is slightly heavier 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
 But the taste will be gone for a while. 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
 People in the distance will not feel it at all. 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
 Will that smell still remain? 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
 Some people are worried 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.500
 The smell will be scattered around a week. 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:37.000
 no problem 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.000
 a long time ago 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.500
 Trinity Island Incident in the United States 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.000
 Although it is also put a big fart 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.500
 But the stool did not leak out 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.000
 There are also often mentioned car Nobi events 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
 That’s really serious. 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
 It was more serious than it is now. 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
 Even diarrhea 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
 And it’s still running around 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.000
 But this time Japan 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
 It’s not going to happen as serious as Carnot 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000
 Because Japan’s original monarch has a diaper 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.800
 So even if the stool leaks out 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.000
 I won’t fly too far too far. 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
 But what if the stool flies over? 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.500
 Really worrying 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.000
 In fact, the really harmful stool is very heavy. 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
 So it’s not very far away. 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
 I think the greatest 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
 Is the doctor who is now feeding the original monarch to take medicine. 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
 They have been staying by the original husband who has a stomachache 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
 Just stay one more day 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
 Will be life-threatening 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.000
 and so 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
 I need to shift medicine from now on. 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
 Despite the poor efficiency of shifting medication 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
 But for the health of doctors 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.000
 There is no other way. 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
 It doesn't matter if you have a diaper that leaks a little bit! 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.000
 Maybe you think so 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.000
 But in fact 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
 No one can handle diapers with stool 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.500
 And it will face the danger of stench when handling 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.000
 Will also spend a lot of money 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.500
 no matter what 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.000
 It is the most important thing to let the original fever go down first. 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.500
 Do not let the original king's stool leak out 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.000
 Is the goal that everyone is working hard 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
 If you see it on TV news 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
 The words "water re-opening" 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000
 what! That is, the doctor uses the water to feed the original monarch to take medicine. 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.000
 Remember to thank the doctors who are feeding the original monarch 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
 If the original king’s stool is really big 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
 Also leaked from the diaper 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
 What will happen then? 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.500
 Although not as serious as the car Nobi incident 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:47.000
 The stool will not fly too far too far 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.800
 But people nearby can’t stay any longer. 

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:53.000
 Fish and vegetables here will also be polluted 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.000
 So come here 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000
 Fukushima residents who are trying to rebuild their homes after the disaster 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
 Will become harder 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.500
 Doctors are because of this 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.000
 Hard work must also cure the original 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.000
 These two days are the key to a successful outcome. 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
 Let us pray for the residents of Fukushima 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
 I hope to return to the normal life as soon as possible. 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.500
 This is also the long-term use of electricity. 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:24.000
 The only thing that can be done for the residents of Fukushima. 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.000
 no problem 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
 as time flows 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
 The original stomach's stomach pain 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
 Must be cured 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
