00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.619 
gonna see a time again where every team
has<00:02:06.500> a<00:02:06.530> has<00:02:07.220> a<00:02:07.250> big<00:02:07.640> manner<00:02:07.880> tries<00:02:08.239> to<00:02:08.450> have<00:02:08.599> a

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:08.629 
has a has a big manner tries to have a

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:10.449 
has a has a big manner tries to have a
dominant<00:02:08.959> big<00:02:09.440> man<00:02:09.649> in<00:02:09.830> there<00:02:10.009> in<00:02:10.129> the<00:02:10.220> middle

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:10.459 
dominant big man in there in the middle

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:12.790 
dominant big man in there in the middle
see<00:02:10.700> what<00:02:10.879> you<00:02:11.330> make<00:02:11.540> if<00:02:11.840> it's<00:02:12.500> because<00:02:12.620> of

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
see what you make if it's because of

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.550 
see what you make if it's because of
defensive<00:02:13.400> presence<00:02:14.000> but<00:02:14.989> I<00:02:15.019> think<00:02:15.290> the<00:02:15.409> game

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
defensive presence but I think the game

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.890 
defensive presence but I think the game
is<00:02:15.620> so<00:02:15.950> quick<00:02:16.310> and<00:02:16.550> so<00:02:16.610> fast<00:02:17.150> now<00:02:17.390> you<00:02:17.480> know<00:02:17.629> one

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
is so quick and so fast now you know one

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.869 
is so quick and so fast now you know one
thing<00:02:18.080> about<00:02:18.200> Shaq<00:02:19.159> that<00:02:19.190> was<00:02:19.519> underestimated

00:02:19.869 --> 00:02:19.879 
thing about Shaq that was underestimated

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:23.080 
thing about Shaq that was underestimated
was<00:02:20.599> that<00:02:20.830> he<00:02:21.830> was<00:02:22.010> just<00:02:22.280> as<00:02:22.400> quick<00:02:22.640> as<00:02:22.790> a<00:02:22.819> guard

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
was that he was just as quick as a guard

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.119 
was that he was just as quick as a guard
he<00:02:23.360> wasn't<00:02:23.659> fast<00:02:23.900> or<00:02:24.230> but<00:02:24.590> I<00:02:24.650> mean<00:02:24.860> when<00:02:25.010> you

00:02:25.119 --> 00:02:25.129 
he wasn't fast or but I mean when you

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:26.850 
he wasn't fast or but I mean when you
have<00:02:25.280> the<00:02:25.430> ball<00:02:25.640> here<00:02:25.670> and<00:02:25.940> you<00:02:26.090> wanted

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
have the ball here and you wanted

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:28.920 
have the ball here and you wanted

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
we move a spin baseline or something you

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:30.480
