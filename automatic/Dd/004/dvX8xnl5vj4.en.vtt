00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
know the ones that aren't lit you have

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.430 
know the ones that aren't lit you have
to<00:00:59.309> look<00:00:59.489> at<00:00:59.730> it<00:00:59.910> so<00:01:00.329> if<00:01:00.539> you<00:01:00.719> can't<00:01:00.989> just<00:01:01.199> like

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
to look at it so if you can't just like

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.799 
to look at it so if you can't just like
walk<00:01:01.469> by<00:01:02.010> and<00:01:02.430> see<00:01:02.699> it<00:01:02.820> and<00:01:03.059> move<00:01:03.329> on<00:01:03.510> like

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
walk by and see it and move on like

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.899 
walk by and see it and move on like
everything<00:01:04.260> else<00:01:04.409> in<00:01:04.680> the<00:01:04.769> city<00:01:04.979> you<00:01:05.580> kind<00:01:05.850> of

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
everything else in the city you kind of

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.060 
everything else in the city you kind of
have<00:01:06.119> to<00:01:06.150> stop<00:01:06.659> you<00:01:07.140> know<00:01:07.290> and<00:01:07.500> just<00:01:07.560> look<00:01:07.860> up

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
have to stop you know and just look up

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.620 
have to stop you know and just look up
and<00:01:08.310> this<00:01:08.400> is<00:01:08.580> like<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:08.850> hardest<00:01:09.060> place<00:01:09.420> in

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
and this is like the hardest place in

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.630 
and this is like the hardest place in
the<00:01:09.720> universe<00:01:10.110> to<00:01:10.290> stop<00:01:10.560> because<00:01:11.280> everyone's

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
the universe to stop because everyone's

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
you know you're late for a train but you

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.149 
you know you're late for a train but you
really<00:01:15.930> have<00:01:16.049> to<00:01:16.170> stop<00:01:16.380> even<00:01:16.650> if<00:01:16.710> just<00:01:16.890> for<00:01:17.009> a

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
really have to stop even if just for a

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.160 
really have to stop even if just for a
second<00:01:17.790> and<00:01:18.119> you<00:01:18.210> look<00:01:18.509> up<00:01:18.720> and<00:01:18.900> you<00:01:18.990> see

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
second and you look up and you see

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.780 
second and you look up and you see
there's<00:01:19.380> these<00:01:19.590> stars<00:01:20.009> you<00:01:20.250> know<00:01:20.490> they're<00:01:20.670> not

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
there's these stars you know they're not

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
real stars and they're not you know we

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.590 
real stars and they're not you know we
heard<00:01:23.340> on<00:01:23.549> the<00:01:23.580> tour<00:01:23.880> they're<00:01:24.119> not<00:01:24.270> even

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
heard on the tour they're not even

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.749 
heard on the tour they're not even
realistic<00:01:25.229> stars<00:01:25.890> but<00:01:26.250> there's<00:01:26.460> still<00:01:26.610> the

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
realistic stars but there's still the

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.530 
realistic stars but there's still the
stars<00:01:27.110> when<00:01:28.110> I<00:01:28.140> was

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:28.540 
stars when I was

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:30.930 
stars when I was
before<00:01:29.170> I<00:01:29.470> don't<00:01:29.590> remember<00:01:30.280> looking<00:01:30.670> up<00:01:30.790> at

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:30.940 
before I don't remember looking up at

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:34.170 
before I don't remember looking up at
the<00:01:31.030> ceiling<00:01:31.210> it's<00:01:31.630> possible<00:01:32.140> that<00:01:32.320> I<00:01:32.350> did<00:01:33.180> now

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:34.180 
the ceiling it's possible that I did now

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:36.060 
the ceiling it's possible that I did now
when<00:01:34.540> I<00:01:34.630> when<00:01:35.080> somebody's<00:01:35.410> telling<00:01:35.680> me<00:01:35.950> to

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:36.070 
when I when somebody's telling me to

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:36.660 
when I when somebody's telling me to
look<00:01:36.220> up

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:36.670 
look up

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:39.810 
look up
it<00:01:37.210> focuses<00:01:38.140> my<00:01:38.350> attention<00:01:38.950> and<00:01:39.220> I<00:01:39.340> thought<00:01:39.610> it

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:39.820 
it focuses my attention and I thought it

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:41.250 
it focuses my attention and I thought it
was<00:01:39.940> really<00:01:40.090> beautiful<00:01:40.330> I<00:01:40.630> particularly<00:01:40.990> like

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:41.260 
was really beautiful I particularly like

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.830 
was really beautiful I particularly like
the<00:01:41.410> color<00:01:41.820> or<00:01:42.820> that<00:01:43.090> was<00:01:43.420> what<00:01:43.600> was<00:01:43.720> really

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:43.840 
the color or that was what was really

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.020 
the color or that was what was really
striking<00:01:44.200> I<00:01:44.710> think<00:01:45.340> we<00:01:45.490> don't<00:01:45.670> tell<00:01:45.880> each

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.030 
striking I think we don't tell each

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:48.600 
striking I think we don't tell each
other<00:01:46.180> to<00:01:46.540> look<00:01:46.810> up<00:01:47.020> as<00:01:47.260> much<00:01:47.620> as<00:01:47.800> as<00:01:48.220> much<00:01:48.460> as

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:48.610 
other to look up as much as as much as

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:51.390 
other to look up as much as as much as
we<00:01:48.760> could<00:01:49.000> or<00:01:49.240> need<00:01:49.570> to<00:01:49.810> I<00:01:50.020> do<00:01:51.010> it<00:01:51.130> a<00:01:51.190> lot<00:01:51.370> more

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:51.400 
we could or need to I do it a lot more

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.610 
we could or need to I do it a lot more

I'll<00:02:09.130> just<00:02:09.399> happen<00:02:09.700> to<00:02:09.790> look<00:02:09.940> out<00:02:10.149> roughly

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
I'll just happen to look out roughly

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.830 
I'll just happen to look out roughly
that<00:02:10.630> much<00:02:10.899> but<00:02:11.560> it's<00:02:11.790> artistically<00:02:12.840> modified

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:52.510 
there's always so much of it is

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:53.540 
there's always so much of it is
underground

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:53.550 
underground

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:55.820 
underground
we<00:04:53.699> go<00:04:54.419> to<00:04:54.599> one<00:04:54.780> place<00:04:54.990> from<00:04:55.289> another<00:04:55.379> you're

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:55.830 
we go to one place from another you're

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:57.439 
we go to one place from another you're
just<00:04:56.009> underground<00:04:56.460> the<00:04:56.580> whole<00:04:56.729> time

00:04:57.439 --> 00:04:57.449 
just underground the whole time

00:04:57.449 --> 00:04:59.779

know not only the the scars on the vault
of<00:05:03.419> Grand<00:05:03.900> Central<00:05:04.319> but<00:05:04.500> they're<00:05:04.680> also<00:05:04.940> buried

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:05.940 
of Grand Central but they're also buried

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:07.659 
of Grand Central but they're also buried
in<00:05:06.180> these<00:05:06.330> like<00:05:06.509> really<00:05:06.750> weird<00:05:07.110> spaces

00:05:07.659 --> 00:05:07.669 
in these like really weird spaces

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:09.830 
in these like really weird spaces
underground<00:05:08.669> and<00:05:08.940> you<00:05:09.030> have<00:05:09.150> to<00:05:09.270> really<00:05:09.479> kind

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:09.840 
underground and you have to really kind

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:11.779 
underground and you have to really kind
of<00:05:09.900> find<00:05:10.259> them<00:05:10.530> and<00:05:10.740> but<00:05:11.340> that's<00:05:11.490> a<00:05:11.610> great

00:05:11.779 --> 00:05:11.789
