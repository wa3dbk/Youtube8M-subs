00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:14.849
 very good data kids in so many 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.560
 tribune another when 2025 remain that we 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.480
 will allow us to climb here on top of the map 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.189
 and good first we need to be 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.020
 invincible I will leave you the tutorial of 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.970
 how it looks in the description of the video and 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.680
 the second is to leave the lumen map 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.439
 aviv I will also leave a video that you 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:32.219
 will teach and well as you see I'm already 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.780
 coming out of what fits and well now what 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.660
 you're going to see in the third person with a 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:39.870
 I greet Jack, he pushes me and it's something 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.489
 well, I have to do it is the 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.930
 elevator package trick for those who do not 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.280
 know how it is done we have to have the 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.289
 lucky that a pathetic and fall on top 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.360
 of another and then our partner 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.739
 will have to alter the one below us 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.719
 above the bottom one with the advantage of 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.360
 engineers we have or genes from above 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:57.000
 and then the trick will cause a model 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.140
 like here it will not take up 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.180
 good as you see here we are flying 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.100
 then we go more or less up 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.510
 we jump without fear of dying to what we are 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.409
 invincible and there is a barrier to whoever 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.420
 made 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:09.180
 and we are here 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.340
 and good as he is pretty handsome already 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.530
 that we are invincible as I have already 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.930
 said I would already be dead at the same 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.729
 and good kids, I'll stop commenting 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:23.509
 already since I'm going to teach a little the 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:23.509
 map and in the end I fall forever 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:26.869
 goodbye 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.890
 yes
