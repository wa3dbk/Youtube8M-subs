00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:33.290 
because that's going to affect how

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:35.230 
because that's going to affect how
quickly<00:00:33.380> we<00:00:33.860> need<00:00:34.040> to<00:00:34.160> action<00:00:34.520> up<00:00:34.640> so<00:00:35.060> how<00:00:35.180> do

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:35.240 
quickly we need to action up so how do

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:37.330 
quickly we need to action up so how do
we<00:00:35.300> assess<00:00:35.570> a<00:00:35.600> demeanor<00:00:36.020> if<00:00:36.320> the<00:00:36.920> years<00:00:37.100> up

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:41.930 
you see responding to witness when we we

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:44.260 
you see responding to witness when we we
touch<00:00:42.140> her<00:00:42.320> another<00:00:43.160> one<00:00:43.370> is<00:00:43.520> if<00:00:43.670> you<00:00:43.760> can<00:00:43.940> see

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:44.270 
touch her another one is if you can see

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:46.420 
touch her another one is if you can see
whether<00:00:44.449> she's<00:00:44.629> dehydrated<00:00:44.949> if<00:00:45.949> you<00:00:46.100> pull<00:00:46.309> the

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:46.430 
whether she's dehydrated if you pull the

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:49.029 
whether she's dehydrated if you pull the
bottom<00:00:46.760> eyelid<00:00:46.969> out<00:00:47.329> there<00:00:47.600> when<00:00:48.440> the<00:00:48.559> cow<00:00:48.739> is

00:00:49.029 --> 00:00:49.039 
bottom eyelid out there when the cow is

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:51.069 
bottom eyelid out there when the cow is
dehydrated<00:00:49.670> the<00:00:49.910> eye<00:00:49.940> will<00:00:50.210> be<00:00:50.239> quite<00:00:50.539> sunken

00:00:51.069 --> 00:00:51.079 
dehydrated the eye will be quite sunken

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:52.930

back<00:00:51.289> so<00:00:51.859> if<00:00:51.980> you're<00:00:52.100> finding<00:00:52.280> the<00:00:52.519> cow<00:00:52.670> on<00:00:52.850> the

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:52.940 
back so if you're finding the cow on the

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:54.250 
back so if you're finding the cow on the
side<00:00:53.090> you<00:00:53.269> need<00:00:53.390> to<00:00:53.539> sit<00:00:53.750> her<00:00:53.809> up<00:00:53.840> straight

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:54.260 
side you need to sit her up straight

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.290 
side you need to sit her up straight
away<00:00:54.410> and<00:00:54.829> find<00:00:55.670> out<00:00:55.760> whether<00:00:55.910> she<00:00:56.149> can

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:56.300 
away and find out whether she can

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.060 
away and find out whether she can
maintain<00:00:56.570> herself<00:00:56.960> in<00:00:57.289> the<00:00:57.379> sitting<00:00:57.649> position

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:58.070 
maintain herself in the sitting position

00:00:58.070 --> 00:00:59.799 
maintain herself in the sitting position
if<00:00:58.519> she<00:00:58.730> can't<00:00:59.000> that<00:00:59.210> means<00:00:59.359> that<00:00:59.539> she<00:00:59.660> might

00:00:59.799 --> 00:00:59.809 
if she can't that means that she might

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:01.509 
if she can't that means that she might
have<00:00:59.960> milk<00:01:00.170> fever<00:01:00.379> or<00:01:00.679> be<00:01:00.800> very<00:01:01.010> very<00:01:01.219> sick

have milk fever or be very very sick

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:03.610 
have milk fever or be very very sick
whereas<00:01:02.390> she<00:01:02.719> might<00:01:02.899> be<00:01:03.079> just<00:01:03.289> in<00:01:03.379> a<00:01:03.440> funny

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:03.620 
whereas she might be just in a funny

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:05.200 
whereas she might be just in a funny
position<00:01:03.800> and<00:01:04.280> you<00:01:04.339> set<00:01:04.519> her<00:01:04.580> up<00:01:04.610> and<00:01:04.879> she<00:01:04.970> can

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:05.210 
position and you set her up and she can

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:07.510 
position and you set her up and she can
if<00:01:05.990> they're<00:01:06.170> staying<00:01:06.410> on<00:01:06.650> the<00:01:06.920> side<00:01:07.100> like<00:01:07.340> this

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:07.520 
if they're staying on the side like this

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:08.830 
if they're staying on the side like this
there's<00:01:07.880> a<00:01:07.940> high<00:01:08.090> risk<00:01:08.330> that<00:01:08.600> they're<00:01:08.720> going

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:08.840 
there's a high risk that they're going

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.320 
there's a high risk that they're going
to<00:01:08.930> end<00:01:09.110> up<00:01:09.230> regurgitating<00:01:09.980> their<00:01:10.700> cud<00:01:10.970> from

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:11.330 
to end up regurgitating their cud from

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.360 
to end up regurgitating their cud from
their<00:01:11.480> rumen<00:01:11.840> it'll<00:01:12.530> come<00:01:12.710> on<00:01:12.860> to<00:01:12.980> their<00:01:13.130> lungs

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:13.370 
their rumen it'll come on to their lungs

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:15.490 
their rumen it'll come on to their lungs
and<00:01:13.580> they're<00:01:13.700> going<00:01:13.850> to<00:01:13.940> die<00:01:14.090> they<00:01:15.080> can<00:01:15.290> get

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:15.500 
and they're going to die they can get

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.469 
and they're going to die they can get
badly<00:01:15.740> bloated<00:01:16.340> and<00:01:16.520> they'll<00:01:16.820> die<00:01:17.000> from<00:01:17.299> that

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:17.479 
badly bloated and they'll die from that

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:19.870 
badly bloated and they'll die from that
so<00:01:18.290> part<00:01:18.619> of<00:01:18.710> the<00:01:18.860> assessment<00:01:19.130> is<00:01:19.400> making<00:01:19.700> sure

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 
so part of the assessment is making sure

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.550 
so part of the assessment is making sure
there's<00:01:20.119> no<00:01:20.150> green<00:01:20.600> muck<00:01:20.869> coming<00:01:21.200> out<00:01:21.320> through

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:21.560 
there's no green muck coming out through

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:22.810 
there's no green muck coming out through
the<00:01:21.680> nostrils<00:01:21.890> when<00:01:22.310> you're<00:01:22.460> looking<00:01:22.670> at

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:22.820 
the nostrils when you're looking at

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.060 
the nostrils when you're looking at
they're<00:01:22.970> on<00:01:23.060> the<00:01:23.150> side<00:01:23.590> the<00:01:24.590> other<00:01:24.619> reason<00:01:25.040> you

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:25.070 
they're on the side the other reason you

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:26.440 
they're on the side the other reason you
don't<00:01:25.189> want<00:01:25.400> them<00:01:25.520> on<00:01:25.579> their<00:01:25.759> side<00:01:25.939> is<00:01:26.150> because

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:26.450 
don't want them on their side is because

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:28.060 
don't want them on their side is because
the<00:01:26.600> nerves<00:01:26.810> underneath<00:01:27.350> the<00:01:27.500> shoulder<00:01:27.860> blade

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:28.070 
the nerves underneath the shoulder blade

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:30.100 
the nerves underneath the shoulder blade
can<00:01:28.310> get<00:01:28.460> squashed<00:01:28.850> on<00:01:29.060> that<00:01:29.360> bottom<00:01:29.659> leg<00:01:29.869> and

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:30.110 
can get squashed on that bottom leg and

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:32.350 
can get squashed on that bottom leg and
they<00:01:30.470> end<00:01:30.680> up<00:01:30.740> with<00:01:30.829> a<00:01:30.920> paralyzed<00:01:31.369> front<00:01:32.119> leg

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:32.360 
they end up with a paralyzed front leg

prolonged<00:03:10.750> and<00:03:10.930> difficult<00:03:11.379> carving<00:03:11.890> with<00:03:12.340> the

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:12.459 
prolonged and difficult carving with the

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:14.160 
prolonged and difficult carving with the
calf<00:03:12.609> has<00:03:12.760> been<00:03:12.910> stuck<00:03:13.239> and<00:03:13.480> damaged<00:03:14.019> the

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 
calf has been stuck and damaged the

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:15.569 
calf has been stuck and damaged the
nerves<00:03:14.200> inside<00:03:14.859> the<00:03:15.040> pelvis

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:15.579 
nerves inside the pelvis

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:18.119 
nerves inside the pelvis
so<00:03:16.150> what<00:03:16.750> you'll<00:03:16.930> tend<00:03:17.140> to<00:03:17.410> find<00:03:17.500> is<00:03:17.859> the<00:03:17.980> cow

00:03:18.119 --> 00:03:18.129 
so what you'll tend to find is the cow

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:21.390 
so what you'll tend to find is the cow
down<00:03:18.400> and<00:03:18.760> the<00:03:19.239> calf<00:03:19.480> will<00:03:19.810> be<00:03:19.989> often<00:03:20.230> dead<00:03:20.620> and

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
down and the calf will be often dead and

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.259 
down and the calf will be often dead and
will<00:03:22.329> be<00:03:22.480> flying<00:03:22.900> behind<00:03:23.290> the<00:03:23.440> cow<00:03:23.650> and<00:03:24.269> good

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:25.269 
will be flying behind the cow and good

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:27.180 
will be flying behind the cow and good
signs<00:03:25.510> often<00:03:25.810> that<00:03:26.049> the<00:03:26.200> vulvar<00:03:26.859> of<00:03:26.919> the<00:03:27.040> cow

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.190 
signs often that the vulvar of the cow

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:29.099 
signs often that the vulvar of the cow
is<00:03:27.400> very<00:03:27.609> swollen<00:03:28.030> because<00:03:28.419> of<00:03:28.630> the<00:03:28.870> trauma

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:29.109 
is very swollen because of the trauma

00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:30.870 
is very swollen because of the trauma
from<00:03:29.410> there<00:03:29.709> so<00:03:30.280> usually<00:03:30.579> it's<00:03:30.700> quite

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:30.880 
from there so usually it's quite

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:31.860 
from there so usually it's quite
obviously<00:03:31.269> that<00:03:31.419> you've<00:03:31.569> had<00:03:31.690> a<00:03:31.720> difficult

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870 
obviously that you've had a difficult

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:33.509 
obviously that you've had a difficult
carving<00:03:32.500> and<00:03:32.620> that<00:03:32.709> is<00:03:32.829> the<00:03:32.950> problem<00:03:33.489> that

00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:33.519 
carving and that is the problem that

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:35.909 
carving and that is the problem that
she's<00:03:33.790> had<00:03:34.030> the<00:03:34.959> cow<00:03:35.139> will<00:03:35.349> be<00:03:35.470> bright<00:03:35.709> and

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:35.919 
she's had the cow will be bright and

00:03:35.919 --> 00:03:37.949 
she's had the cow will be bright and
alert<00:03:36.130> and<00:03:36.430> quite<00:03:36.609> responsive<00:03:37.239> so<00:03:37.750> it's

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:37.959 
alert and quite responsive so it's

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:39.809 
alert and quite responsive so it's
causing<00:03:38.349> a<00:03:38.440> paralysis<00:03:38.919> of<00:03:38.980> the<00:03:39.099> back<00:03:39.310> end<00:03:39.579> as

00:03:39.809 --> 00:03:39.819 
causing a paralysis of the back end as

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:42.569 
causing a paralysis of the back end as
the<00:03:40.120> weakness<00:03:40.769> if<00:03:41.769> it's<00:03:42.010> not<00:03:42.130> a<00:03:42.160> carving

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:42.579 
the weakness if it's not a carving

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:44.280 
the weakness if it's not a carving
paralysis<00:03:43.060> other<00:03:43.329> common<00:03:43.780> things<00:03:43.989> you<00:03:44.169> can

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 
paralysis other common things you can

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:46.680 
paralysis other common things you can
have<00:03:44.410> back<00:03:44.620> injuries<00:03:45.099> or<00:03:45.359> damage<00:03:46.359> to<00:03:46.389> the

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690 
have back injuries or damage to the

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:48.720 
have back injuries or damage to the
limbs<00:03:47.069> dislocate<00:03:48.069> the<00:03:48.190> hips<00:03:48.400> are<00:03:48.549> quite

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:48.730 
limbs dislocate the hips are quite

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:50.430 
limbs dislocate the hips are quite
common<00:03:49.090> in<00:03:49.209> cows<00:03:49.450> when<00:03:49.900> they've<00:03:50.019> been<00:03:50.049> jumped

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:50.440 
common in cows when they've been jumped

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.319 
common in cows when they've been jumped
on<00:03:50.530> by<00:03:50.709> another<00:03:50.919> cow<00:03:51.430> or<00:03:51.910> perhaps<00:03:52.120> when

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:52.329 
on by another cow or perhaps when

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:53.640 
on by another cow or perhaps when
they've<00:03:52.480> done<00:03:52.569> the<00:03:52.690> splits<00:03:52.930> in<00:03:53.049> the<00:03:53.169> yard<00:03:53.380> and

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:53.650 
they've done the splits in the yard and

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:55.500 
they've done the splits in the yard and
they<00:03:54.130> can<00:03:54.310> occasionally<00:03:54.849> break<00:03:55.030> their<00:03:55.269> legs

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:55.510 
they can occasionally break their legs

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:57.390 
they can occasionally break their legs
so<00:03:55.959> it's<00:03:56.109> important<00:03:56.590> to<00:03:56.650> assess<00:03:57.010> what<00:03:57.250> the

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:57.400 
so it's important to assess what the

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.000 
so it's important to assess what the
league<00:03:57.579> is<00:03:57.760> looking<00:03:57.790> like<00:03:58.329> and<00:03:58.889> finding<00:03:59.889> out

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:00.010 
league is looking like and finding out

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:03.089 
league is looking like and finding out
whether<00:04:00.190> it's<00:04:00.430> got<00:04:00.910> any<00:04:01.060> obvious<00:04:01.349> breaks<00:04:02.349> or

00:04:03.089 --> 00:04:03.099 
whether it's got any obvious breaks or

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:05.280 
whether it's got any obvious breaks or
torn<00:04:03.609> muscles<00:04:04.120> if<00:04:04.629> the<00:04:04.870> hip<00:04:05.019> is<00:04:05.169> dislocated

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.290 
torn muscles if the hip is dislocated

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:07.530 
torn muscles if the hip is dislocated
the<00:04:06.099> leg<00:04:06.280> often<00:04:06.579> sits<00:04:06.819> out<00:04:06.970> I'm<00:04:07.090> on<00:04:07.209> a<00:04:07.239> bit<00:04:07.419> of<00:04:07.510> a

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:07.540 
the leg often sits out I'm on a bit of a

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:09.360 
the leg often sits out I'm on a bit of a
funny<00:04:07.750> angle<00:04:07.930> so<00:04:08.260> it<00:04:08.349> looks<00:04:08.530> strange<00:04:08.919> from<00:04:09.280> the

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:09.370 
funny angle so it looks strange from the

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:12.089 
funny angle so it looks strange from the
side<00:04:09.810> the<00:04:10.810> best<00:04:11.079> way<00:04:11.290> to<00:04:11.319> take<00:04:11.620> that<00:04:11.829> is<00:04:11.949> to

00:04:12.089 --> 00:04:12.099 
side the best way to take that is to

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:13.770 
side the best way to take that is to
roll<00:04:12.280> the<00:04:12.310> cow<00:04:12.579> on<00:04:12.760> to<00:04:12.849> a<00:04:12.879> side<00:04:13.209> and<00:04:13.540> then<00:04:13.660> have

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:13.780 
roll the cow on to a side and then have

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:15.629 
roll the cow on to a side and then have
a<00:04:13.840> feel<00:04:14.079> of<00:04:14.109> the<00:04:14.319> hip<00:04:14.500> so<00:04:15.099> what<00:04:15.220> we<00:04:15.340> need<00:04:15.459> to<00:04:15.489> do

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:15.639 
a feel of the hip so what we need to do

00:04:15.639 --> 00:04:17.310 
a feel of the hip so what we need to do
is<00:04:15.760> pull<00:04:15.910> on<00:04:16.030> the<00:04:16.180> side<00:04:16.329> but<00:04:16.539> put<00:04:16.690> paper<00:04:16.959> under

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:17.320 
is pull on the side but put paper under

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:21.920 
is pull on the side but put paper under
and<00:04:17.859> get<00:04:17.979> it<00:04:18.130> to<00:04:18.190> go<00:04:18.280> over<00:04:18.579> on<00:04:18.669> the<00:04:18.699> side

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:21.930 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:28.020 

like<00:04:22.930> that<00:04:25.770> now<00:04:26.770> if<00:04:27.040> it's<00:04:27.250> a<00:04:27.310> dissipated<00:04:27.850> hip

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:28.030 
like that now if it's a dissipated hip

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:30.420 
like that now if it's a dissipated hip
the<00:04:28.750> hip<00:04:28.900> is<00:04:29.050> going<00:04:29.230> to<00:04:29.320> feel<00:04:29.530> funny<00:04:29.860> and<00:04:30.010> the

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:30.430 
the hip is going to feel funny and the

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:33.000 
the hip is going to feel funny and the
best<00:04:30.610> way<00:04:30.760> to<00:04:30.790> do<00:04:31.060> that<00:04:31.210> is<00:04:31.389> to<00:04:31.540> actually<00:04:32.010> being

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:33.010 
best way to do that is to actually being

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:35.370 
best way to do that is to actually being
careful<00:04:33.550> not<00:04:33.580> to<00:04:33.730> get<00:04:33.940> kicked<00:04:34.150> put<00:04:35.050> your<00:04:35.200> hand

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:35.380 
careful not to get kicked put your hand

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:38.159 
careful not to get kicked put your hand
on<00:04:35.530> the<00:04:35.680> hip<00:04:35.800> like<00:04:36.010> that<00:04:36.280> and<00:04:37.120> lift<00:04:37.330> the<00:04:37.450> leg<00:04:37.630> up

00:04:38.159 --> 00:04:38.169 
on the hip like that and lift the leg up

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:41.340 
on the hip like that and lift the leg up
and<00:04:38.760> if<00:04:39.760> it<00:04:39.910> is<00:04:40.000> dislocated<00:04:40.300> often<00:04:40.870> feel<00:04:41.139> a

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:41.350 
and if it is dislocated often feel a

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:44.580 
and if it is dislocated often feel a
bony<00:04:42.570> grating<00:04:43.570> noise<00:04:43.600> and<00:04:44.139> if<00:04:44.350> that's<00:04:44.440> the

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:44.590 
bony grating noise and if that's the

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:45.810 
bony grating noise and if that's the
case<00:04:44.680> that's<00:04:45.100> something<00:04:45.400> seriously<00:04:45.730> wrong

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:45.820 
case that's something seriously wrong

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:47.340 
case that's something seriously wrong
and<00:04:46.150> it<00:04:46.240> needs<00:04:46.450> a<00:04:46.570> bit<00:04:46.720> to<00:04:46.900> have<00:04:47.020> a<00:04:47.080> look<00:04:47.260> at

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:47.350 
and it needs a bit to have a look at

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:49.530 
and it needs a bit to have a look at
that
