scrubbing<00:02:18.489> is<00:02:18.700> a<00:02:18.790> writer<00:02:19.150> and<00:02:19.599> then<00:02:20.140> and<00:02:20.470> he

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
scrubbing is a writer and then and he

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.559 
scrubbing is a writer and then and he
does<00:02:20.800> other<00:02:20.950> stuff<00:02:21.280> too<00:02:21.459> but<00:02:21.640> and<00:02:21.879> then<00:02:22.360> so

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:22.569 
does other stuff too but and then so

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:24.360 
does other stuff too but and then so
this<00:02:22.750> is<00:02:22.930> what<00:02:23.110> I<00:02:23.319> said<00:02:23.560> put<00:02:23.769> this<00:02:23.890> on<00:02:24.099> so<00:02:24.340> I

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
this is what I said put this on so I
