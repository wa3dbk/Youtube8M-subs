of lego mindstorms pieces or what some
people<00:00:18.510> call<00:00:18.720> technic<00:00:19.590> pieces<00:00:20.130> and<00:00:20.630> a<00:00:21.630> bit<00:00:21.930> of

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:22.160 
people call technic pieces and a bit of

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.330 
people call technic pieces and a bit of
bricks<00:00:23.160> here<00:00:23.490> so<00:00:24.619> I'm<00:00:25.619> just<00:00:25.740> gonna<00:00:25.980> quickly

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
bricks here so I'm just gonna quickly

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:36.370 
bricks here so I'm just gonna quickly
shoot<00:00:26.880> it<00:00:32.840> actually<00:00:33.840> goes<00:00:33.989> really<00:00:34.200> far<00:00:35.030> and

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:36.380

it's pretty strong so um this is
basically<00:00:46.020> how<00:00:46.379> to<00:00:46.680> build<00:00:46.920> it<00:00:47.039> I'm<00:00:47.160> not<00:00:47.579> going

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
basically how to build it I'm not going

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.029 
basically how to build it I'm not going

let's go through the features right here

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.180 
let's go through the features right here
we<00:01:00.090> just<00:01:00.239> have<00:01:00.449> like<00:01:00.629> a<00:01:00.690> little<00:01:00.960> grip<00:01:01.559> thing<00:01:02.039> to

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
we just have like a little grip thing to

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.870 
we just have like a little grip thing to
hold<00:01:02.309> on<00:01:02.570> to<00:01:04.790> ok<00:01:05.790> this<00:01:05.970> is<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:06.210> trigger<00:01:06.570> system

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:07.880 
hold on to ok this is the trigger system

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:13.130 
hold on to ok this is the trigger system
go<00:01:08.880> back<00:01:09.060> to<00:01:09.240> that<00:01:09.360> later<00:01:09.570> but<00:01:11.960> that's<00:01:12.960> it

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
go back to that later but that's it

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.499 
go back to that later but that's it
right<00:01:13.260> there<00:01:14.570> ok<00:01:15.570> so<00:01:17.060> there's<00:01:18.060> two<00:01:18.299> rubber

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
right there ok so there's two rubber

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.450 
right there ok so there's two rubber
bands<00:01:18.780> they're<00:01:19.049> connected<00:01:19.590> to<00:01:19.619> here<00:01:19.979> so<00:01:20.369> it

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
bands they're connected to here so it

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.789 
bands they're connected to here so it
springs<00:01:20.790> back<00:01:20.939> you<00:01:21.930> have<00:01:22.049> the<00:01:22.170> rubber<00:01:22.320> band<00:01:22.650> on

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
springs back you have the rubber band on

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.359 
springs back you have the rubber band on
here<00:01:23.130> up<00:01:23.610> here<00:01:24.170> so<00:01:25.170> and<00:01:25.500> then<00:01:25.619> it<00:01:25.710> goes<00:01:25.979> off<00:01:26.189> and

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
here up here so and then it goes off and

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.980 
here up here so and then it goes off and
it<00:01:26.460> shoots<00:01:26.990> so<00:01:27.990> that's<00:01:28.170> the<00:01:28.380> trigger<00:01:28.619> system

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:29.990 
it shoots so that's the trigger system

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:32.870 
it shoots so that's the trigger system
you<00:01:30.990> have<00:01:31.110> a<00:01:31.170> little<00:01:31.500> safety<00:01:31.770> lock<00:01:32.159> here<00:01:32.579> that

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
you have a little safety lock here that

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:40.010 
you have a little safety lock here that
