got the pattern from they call it a

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.120 
got the pattern from they call it a
granny<00:00:13.139> mandala<00:00:13.740> it's<00:00:15.770> pretty<00:00:16.770> much<00:00:16.890> the<00:00:17.100> same

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
granny mandala it's pretty much the same

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.179 
granny mandala it's pretty much the same
design<00:00:17.670> for<00:00:17.699> the<00:00:18.090> granny<00:00:18.330> circle<00:00:18.869> but<00:00:19.140> I<00:00:19.470> mean

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
design for the granny circle but I mean

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.420 
design for the granny circle but I mean
the<00:00:20.699> granny<00:00:20.970> mandala<00:00:21.570> put<00:00:21.900> it<00:00:22.020> boy<00:00:22.619> it's<00:00:22.800> like

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
the granny mandala put it boy it's like

the granny mandala put it boy it's like
this<00:00:23.670> square<00:00:23.910> but<00:00:24.150> it's<00:00:25.109> a<00:00:25.199> circle<00:00:25.529> so<00:00:25.859> going

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
this square but it's a circle so going

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.389 
this square but it's a circle so going
with<00:00:26.670> a<00:00:26.840> geometric<00:00:27.840> shapes<00:00:28.170> I<00:00:28.939> figured<00:00:29.939> we<00:00:30.179> do

00:00:31.389 --> 00:00:31.399 
with a geometric shapes I figured we do

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:34.850 
with a geometric shapes I figured we do
circle<00:00:32.399> next<00:00:32.610> so<00:00:33.110> what<00:00:34.110> I'm<00:00:34.230> going<00:00:34.380> to<00:00:34.440> do<00:00:34.620> is

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
circle next so what I'm going to do is

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.889 
circle next so what I'm going to do is
make<00:00:35.790> the<00:00:36.570> as<00:00:38.270> crocheting<00:00:39.270> with<00:00:39.420> RAM<00:00:39.690> and

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
make the as crocheting with RAM and

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.260 
make the as crocheting with RAM and
calls<00:00:40.110> it<00:00:40.260> the<00:00:40.379> Magic<00:00:40.770> Circle<00:00:42.230> so<00:00:43.230> chain<00:00:43.530> 4<00:00:43.920> and

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:44.270 
calls it the Magic Circle so chain 4 and

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:47.950 
calls it the Magic Circle so chain 4 and
then<00:00:45.270> you<00:00:45.450> join<00:00:45.690> do<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:46.530> slip<00:00:46.739> stitch<00:00:47.039> to<00:00:47.070> join

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:47.960 
then you join do the slip stitch to join

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:55.580 
then you join do the slip stitch to join
it<00:00:48.960> together<00:00:50.600> and<00:00:51.600> then<00:00:51.750> chain<00:00:52.260> 1<00:00:53.000> 2<00:00:54.170> 3<00:00:55.170> and

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
it together and then chain 1 2 3 and

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:01.479 
it together and then chain 1 2 3 and
then<00:00:56.160> we're<00:00:56.399> going<00:00:56.520> to<00:00:56.610> do<00:00:58.430> 1<00:00:59.430> double<00:00:59.760> crochet

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:01.489 
then we're going to do 1 double crochet

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:08.050 
then we're going to do 1 double crochet
chain<00:01:02.489> 1<00:01:02.789> and<00:01:03.000> then<00:01:03.600> we're<00:01:03.809> going<00:01:03.930> to<00:01:04.019> do<00:01:06.590> 2

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.060 
chain 1 and then we're going to do 2

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.870 
chain 1 and then we're going to do 2
double<00:01:09.060> crochets<00:01:10.220> we're<00:01:11.220> going<00:01:11.400> to<00:01:11.460> do<00:01:11.640> this<00:01:11.850> a

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
double crochets we're going to do this a

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.410 
double crochets we're going to do this a
total<00:01:13.070> when<00:01:14.070> we<00:01:14.250> have<00:01:14.460> a<00:01:14.490> total<00:01:15.030> of<00:01:15.090> 6

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
total when we have a total of 6

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:22.460 
total when we have a total of 6
different<00:01:15.869> clusters<00:01:17.509> so<00:01:20.720> this<00:01:21.720> is<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:22.140> third

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
different clusters so this is the third

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:29.400 
different clusters so this is the third
one

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:29.410 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:37.250 

so<00:01:30.410> one<00:01:30.710> two<00:01:32.710> three

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:37.260 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:45.190 

or

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.740 

and<00:01:45.799> what<00:01:46.250> I'm<00:01:46.369> using<00:01:46.400> is<00:01:46.880> a<00:01:46.909> variegated<00:01:47.420> yarn

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:47.750 
and what I'm using is a variegated yarn

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.170 
and what I'm using is a variegated yarn
pretty<00:01:48.590> much<00:01:48.799> to<00:01:49.520> give<00:01:49.670> it<00:01:49.790> a<00:01:49.850> little<00:01:49.970> bit

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:50.180 
pretty much to give it a little bit

00:01:50.180 --> 00:02:00.920 
pretty much to give it a little bit
different<00:01:51.049> color<00:01:51.439> as<00:01:51.740> we<00:01:52.580> go<00:01:52.729> along

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.110 

and<00:02:01.470> then<00:02:01.590> after<00:02:01.950> the<00:02:02.070> 6th<00:02:02.370> little<00:02:02.670> chain<00:02:02.880> one

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:03.120 
and then after the 6th little chain one

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:06.650 
and then after the 6th little chain one
and<00:02:03.330> then<00:02:03.420> do<00:02:03.900> the<00:02:04.110> slip<00:02:04.350> stitch<00:02:04.650> to<00:02:05.660> complete

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:06.660 
and then do the slip stitch to complete

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
and then do the slip stitch to complete
the<00:02:06.990> circle<00:02:07.410> and<00:02:08.690> then<00:02:09.690> the<00:02:10.080> pattern<00:02:10.440> that<00:02:10.470> I'm

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:10.680 
the circle and then the pattern that I'm

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:13.340 
the circle and then the pattern that I'm
going<00:02:10.860> to<00:02:10.920> show<00:02:11.550> you<00:02:11.610> from<00:02:12.000> I<00:02:12.300> did<00:02:12.780> screenshots

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
going to show you from I did screenshots

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.910 
going to show you from I did screenshots
they<00:02:14.280> call<00:02:14.700> each<00:02:15.030> part<00:02:15.750> around<00:02:15.990> so<00:02:16.530> this<00:02:16.680> is

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
they call each part around so this is

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:23.870 
they call each part around so this is
round<00:02:17.250> one<00:02:18.410> the<00:02:19.410> next<00:02:19.710> two<00:02:21.110> next<00:02:22.110> round<00:02:22.850> we<00:02:23.850> are

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
round one the next two next round we are

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.640 
round one the next two next round we are
going<00:02:24.510> to<00:02:24.780> out<00:02:25.350> that<00:02:25.710> double<00:02:26.100> chain<00:02:26.880> is<00:02:27.150> do<00:02:27.990> one

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
going to out that double chain is do one

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:34.580 
going to out that double chain is do one
more<00:02:28.830> double<00:02:29.130> crochet<00:02:29.550> a<00:02:30.170> chain<00:02:31.170> and<00:02:32.720> then<00:02:33.720> two

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
more double crochet a chain and then two

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:39.699 
more double crochet a chain and then two
double<00:02:34.950> crochets<00:02:35.430> in<00:02:35.730> the<00:02:36.030> same<00:02:37.610> location

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:39.709 
double crochets in the same location

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:44.110 
double crochets in the same location
this<00:02:40.709> is<00:02:40.740> going<00:02:41.100> to<00:02:41.160> help<00:02:41.400> us<00:02:41.610> advance<00:02:41.940> on<00:02:42.570> the

end of each round you're going to do a

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.670 
end of each round you're going to do a
slip<00:02:58.200> stitch<00:02:58.260> with<00:02:58.770> a<00:02:58.800> new<00:02:59.040> color<00:02:59.420> now<00:03:00.680> pretty

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
slip stitch with a new color now pretty

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.720 
slip stitch with a new color now pretty
much<00:03:01.890> what<00:03:02.100> you<00:03:02.220> do<00:03:02.400> is<00:03:02.730> how<00:03:03.180> you<00:03:03.680> did<00:03:04.680> bring<00:03:05.550> in

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
much what you do is how you did bring in

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.630 
much what you do is how you did bring in
a<00:03:05.820> new<00:03:05.940> color<00:03:06.150> you<00:03:06.450> just<00:03:07.250> do<00:03:08.250> a<00:03:08.280> slip<00:03:08.580> stitch

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
a new color you just do a slip stitch

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.380 
a new color you just do a slip stitch
but<00:03:09.209> using<00:03:09.840> a<00:03:09.900> different<00:03:09.930> thread<00:03:10.500> on<00:03:10.739> it<00:03:11.390> at

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
but using a different thread on it at

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:14.210 
but using a different thread on it at
that<00:03:12.780> point<00:03:13.050> I<00:03:13.230> usually<00:03:13.590> will<00:03:13.739> just<00:03:13.950> tie<00:03:14.160> the

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
that point I usually will just tie the

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:17.600 
that point I usually will just tie the
two<00:03:14.910> ends<00:03:15.120> together<00:03:15.480> and<00:03:16.040> then<00:03:17.040> weave<00:03:17.430> them

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:17.610 
two ends together and then weave them

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:21.830 
two ends together and then weave them
together<00:03:18.350> into<00:03:19.350> the<00:03:19.769> pattern<00:03:20.160> to<00:03:20.540> hide<00:03:21.540> the

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
together into the pattern to hide the

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:28.070 
together into the pattern to hide the
ends<00:03:23.360> but<00:03:24.739> I'm<00:03:25.739> just<00:03:26.010> showing<00:03:26.130> you<00:03:26.550> as<00:03:26.730> if<00:03:27.269> we

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:28.080 
ends but I'm just showing you as if we

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:30.830 
ends but I'm just showing you as if we
are<00:03:28.230> just<00:03:28.380> making<00:03:28.860> the<00:03:29.010> the<00:03:29.760> circle<00:03:30.239> with<00:03:30.810> one

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
are just making the the circle with one

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:35.150 
are just making the the circle with one
thread<00:03:31.410> yarn<00:03:33.170> so<00:03:34.170> if<00:03:34.320> you<00:03:34.470> want<00:03:34.709> to<00:03:34.860> try<00:03:35.130> a

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160 
thread yarn so if you want to try a

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:39.710 
thread yarn so if you want to try a
little<00:03:35.640> bit<00:03:35.790> more<00:03:36.390> of<00:03:36.660> a<00:03:37.250> challenge<00:03:38.720> which

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
little bit more of a challenge which

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.620 
little bit more of a challenge which
it's<00:03:40.320> not<00:03:40.560> much<00:03:40.890> of<00:03:40.920> a<00:03:41.130> challenge<00:03:41.400> just<00:03:41.970> adding

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:42.630 
it's not much of a challenge just adding

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:49.300 
it's not much of a challenge just adding
a<00:03:42.690> new<00:03:44.450> color<00:03:45.450> in<00:03:45.780> you<00:03:46.769> can<00:03:46.980> always<00:03:47.220> add<00:03:47.690> the

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:49.310 
a new color in you can always add the

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:54.560 
a new color in you can always add the
new<00:03:50.310> colors<00:03:50.670> at<00:03:50.820> that<00:03:51.000> point<00:03:51.269> in<00:03:51.360> time<00:03:51.540> so<00:03:53.570> and

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:54.570 
new colors at that point in time so and

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:58.900 
new colors at that point in time so and
I'm<00:03:55.200> gonna<00:03:55.380> do<00:03:55.890> a<00:03:55.920> series<00:03:56.549> of<00:03:56.670> these<00:03:57.000> videos<00:03:57.510> so

00:03:58.900 --> 00:03:58.910 
I'm gonna do a series of these videos so

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:03.170 
I'm gonna do a series of these videos so
because<00:03:59.910> the<00:04:00.750> pattern<00:04:01.380> talked<00:04:02.250> about<00:04:02.549> up<00:04:02.850> to

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
because the pattern talked about up to

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:06.410 
because the pattern talked about up to
16<00:04:03.930> rows<00:04:04.230> and<00:04:04.650> there's<00:04:04.830> a<00:04:04.950> couple<00:04:05.220> parts<00:04:06.060> in

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:06.420 
16 rows and there's a couple parts in

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:10.699 
16 rows and there's a couple parts in
the<00:04:08.540> pattern<00:04:09.540> that<00:04:09.570> it's<00:04:09.900> kind<00:04:10.260> of<00:04:10.350> repetitive

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:10.709 
the pattern that it's kind of repetitive

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:13.320 
the pattern that it's kind of repetitive
so

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:13.330 

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:18.539 

I<00:04:14.550> don't<00:04:15.550> need<00:04:15.760> to<00:04:15.970> show<00:04:16.450> you<00:04:16.709> the<00:04:17.709> in<00:04:17.890> progress

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:18.549 
I don't need to show you the in progress

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:24.300 
I don't need to show you the in progress
of<00:04:18.790> me<00:04:19.630> doing<00:04:20.049> those<00:04:22.500> those<00:04:23.500> particular

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:24.310 
of me doing those those particular

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:30.510 
of me doing those those particular
rounds<00:04:25.110> so<00:04:27.360> we<00:04:28.360> got<00:04:28.570> round<00:04:29.410> 1<00:04:29.740> and<00:04:29.950> round<00:04:30.040> 2

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:30.520 
rounds so we got round 1 and round 2

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.480 
rounds so we got round 1 and round 2
done<00:04:30.850> so<00:04:31.210> we<00:04:31.360> get<00:04:31.480> the<00:04:31.630> start<00:04:31.930> of<00:04:32.140> the<00:04:32.890> circle<00:04:33.310> I

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:33.490 
done so we get the start of the circle I

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:37.470 
done so we get the start of the circle I
am<00:04:33.540> going<00:04:34.540> to<00:04:34.810> post<00:04:35.260> the<00:04:36.240> screenshots<00:04:37.240> that<00:04:37.360> I

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:37.480 
am going to post the screenshots that I

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:41.820 
am going to post the screenshots that I
took<00:04:37.720> from<00:04:37.960> crocheting<00:04:39.240> from<00:04:40.240> Raymond<00:04:40.600> and<00:04:40.830> at

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:41.830 
took from crocheting from Raymond and at

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:43.950 
took from crocheting from Raymond and at
the<00:04:42.070> end<00:04:42.220> of<00:04:42.280> this<00:04:42.400> video<00:04:42.580> so<00:04:43.000> next<00:04:43.630> we're

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:43.960 
the end of this video so next we're

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:48.350 
the end of this video so next we're
going<00:04:44.050> to<00:04:44.110> do<00:04:44.530> rounds<00:04:45.460> three<00:04:45.850> and<00:04:46.000> four<00:04:46.210> and

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:48.360 
going to do rounds three and four and

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:50.190 
going to do rounds three and four and
we'll<00:04:49.360> be<00:04:49.510> good<00:04:49.690> to<00:04:49.750> go
