00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:06.450 
so we're going to do a tutorial for

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.560 
so we're going to do a tutorial for
planetary<00:00:07.200> invasion<00:00:07.620> in<00:00:08.010> ascendency<00:00:08.670> and<00:00:09.090> I'm

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
planetary invasion in ascendency and I'm

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.419 
planetary invasion in ascendency and I'm
going<00:00:09.840> to<00:00:09.900> load<00:00:10.170> up<00:00:10.260> a<00:00:10.349> game<00:00:10.559> where<00:00:10.769> I<00:00:11.010> know<00:00:11.099> we

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
going to load up a game where I know we

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:16.090 
going to load up a game where I know we
have<00:00:11.780> the<00:00:12.780> right<00:00:13.170> circumstances<00:00:13.920> to<00:00:14.160> do<00:00:14.280> that

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:16.100 
have the right circumstances to do that

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:20.120 
have the right circumstances to do that
here<00:00:17.100> we<00:00:17.279> are<00:00:17.490> so<00:00:18.449> we're<00:00:19.350> going<00:00:19.529> to<00:00:19.770> look<00:00:20.010> at

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
here we are so we're going to look at

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.990 
here we are so we're going to look at
the<00:00:20.310> planet<00:00:20.779> Cloris<00:00:21.779> and<00:00:22.550> we'll<00:00:23.550> see<00:00:23.730> that<00:00:23.880> we

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
the planet Cloris and we'll see that we

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.140 
the planet Cloris and we'll see that we
have<00:00:24.029> two<00:00:24.449> ships<00:00:24.779> here<00:00:25.019> and<00:00:25.730> they<00:00:26.730> are<00:00:26.760> both

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
have two ships here and they are both

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.200 
have two ships here and they are both
loaded<00:00:27.510> up<00:00:27.750> with<00:00:28.080> a<00:00:28.439> good<00:00:29.340> amount<00:00:29.490> of<00:00:29.699> invaders

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:32.210 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:34.160 

we're<00:00:33.210> going<00:00:33.390> to<00:00:33.570> be<00:00:33.660> going<00:00:33.809> to<00:00:34.079> the

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
we're going to be going to the

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:48.709 
we're going to be going to the
brilliance<00:00:34.590> system

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.950 

all<00:00:49.719> that<00:00:49.899> time<00:00:50.140> pass<00:00:51.420> in<00:00:52.420> the<00:00:52.600> brilliant

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:52.960 
all that time pass in the brilliant

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.770 
all that time pass in the brilliant
system<00:00:53.440> now<00:00:54.089> and<00:00:55.089> there's<00:00:55.300> the<00:00:55.359> planner<00:00:55.600> we're

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:55.780 
system now and there's the planner we're

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:57.240 
system now and there's the planner we're
going<00:00:55.960> to<00:00:56.050> invade<00:00:56.260> now<00:00:56.469> we<00:00:56.589> popped<00:00:56.829> out<00:00:56.980> very

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:57.250 
going to invade now we popped out very

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:00.420 
going to invade now we popped out very
close<00:00:57.670> and<00:00:58.409> that<00:00:59.409> may<00:00:59.620> or<00:00:59.710> may<00:00:59.800> not<00:00:59.829> be<00:01:00.010> okay<00:01:00.399> I

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:00.430 
close and that may or may not be okay I

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:03.240 
close and that may or may not be okay I
don't<00:01:00.640> know<00:01:00.940> if<00:01:01.170> so<00:01:02.170> we<00:01:02.559> don't<00:01:02.710> have<00:01:02.829> sensors

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:03.250 
don't know if so we don't have sensors

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:04.710 
don't know if so we don't have sensors
on<00:01:03.399> her<00:01:03.519> ships<00:01:03.760> right<00:01:04.000> now<00:01:04.180> we<00:01:04.239> didn't<00:01:04.570> put

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:04.720 
on her ships right now we didn't put

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:06.480 
on her ships right now we didn't put
them<00:01:04.839> on<00:01:05.019> we<00:01:05.229> wanted<00:01:05.890> to<00:01:05.950> load<00:01:06.190> them<00:01:06.340> up<00:01:06.430> with

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:06.490 
them on we wanted to load them up with

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:08.340 
them on we wanted to load them up with
invaders<00:01:07.090> so<00:01:07.780> I'm<00:01:07.840> going<00:01:07.990> to<00:01:08.020> get<00:01:08.170> out<00:01:08.320> of

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:08.350 
invaders so I'm going to get out of

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:13.050 
invaders so I'm going to get out of
range<00:01:08.649> just<00:01:09.040> in<00:01:09.159> case<00:01:09.399> he<00:01:09.549> can<00:01:09.790> shoot<00:01:10.149> at<00:01:10.330> us<00:01:12.060> he

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:13.060 
range just in case he can shoot at us he

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:17.310 
range just in case he can shoot at us he
didn't<00:01:13.360> shoot<00:01:13.630> that<00:01:13.690> time<00:01:15.899> but<00:01:16.899> he<00:01:16.990> did<00:01:17.020> that

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:17.320 
didn't shoot that time but he did that

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.859 
didn't shoot that time but he did that
time<00:01:17.759> summer<00:01:18.759> to<00:01:18.909> activate<00:01:19.299> shields<00:01:19.659> I<00:01:19.720> should

00:01:19.859 --> 00:01:19.869 
time summer to activate shields I should

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:22.350 
time summer to activate shields I should
have<00:01:19.990> done<00:01:20.110> that<00:01:20.170> before<00:01:20.909> but<00:01:21.909> I'll<00:01:22.060> get<00:01:22.270> out

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:22.360 
have done that before but I'll get out

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:23.580 
have done that before but I'll get out
of<00:01:22.479> range<00:01:22.659> it<00:01:22.780> seems<00:01:22.960> like<00:01:23.110> he<00:01:23.229> only<00:01:23.380> has

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:23.590 
of range it seems like he only has

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.580 
of range it seems like he only has
missile<00:01:23.950> bases<00:01:24.100> so<00:01:24.429> i<00:01:24.460> can<00:01:24.759> easily<00:01:25.300> get<00:01:26.289> out<00:01:26.350> of

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:26.590 
missile bases so i can easily get out of

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.210 
missile bases so i can easily get out of
their<00:01:26.710> range<00:01:27.569> activate<00:01:28.569> my<00:01:28.750> accutron<00:01:29.590> here<00:01:29.890> to

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:30.220 
their range activate my accutron here to

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:36.260 
their range activate my accutron here to
add<00:01:31.649> range<00:01:32.649> to<00:01:32.890> my<00:01:33.039> weapons<00:01:34.050> and<00:01:35.050> start<00:01:35.319> fires

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
add range to my weapons and start fires

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:42.059 
add range to my weapons and start fires
and<00:01:37.270> see<00:01:37.659> that<00:01:40.229> spin<00:01:41.229> around<00:01:41.350> you<00:01:41.590> can<00:01:41.770> see<00:01:41.800> he

00:01:42.059 --> 00:01:42.069 
and see that spin around you can see he

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:44.249 
and see that spin around you can see he
has<00:01:42.100> shields<00:01:42.670> around<00:01:42.759> his<00:01:43.119> planet<00:01:43.539> so<00:01:44.020> we<00:01:44.140> do

00:01:44.249 --> 00:01:44.259 
has shields around his planet so we do

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:51.560 
has shields around his planet so we do
have<00:01:44.289> to<00:01:44.560> take<00:01:44.740> them<00:01:44.950> down<00:01:44.979> first

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:58.530 

and<00:01:52.570> they're<00:01:52.780> down<00:01:54.840> our<00:01:55.840> first<00:01:56.770> ship<00:01:57.070> on<00:01:57.760> if<00:01:58.330> he

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:58.540 
and they're down our first ship on if he

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:00.750 
and they're down our first ship on if he
has<00:01:58.720> enough<00:01:58.990> invaders<00:01:59.470> then<00:01:59.950> it'll<00:02:00.190> take<00:02:00.430> over

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:00.760 
has enough invaders then it'll take over

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:04.560 
has enough invaders then it'll take over
and<00:02:01.110> I<00:02:02.110> think<00:02:02.350> he<00:02:02.410> does<00:02:02.970> this<00:02:03.970> guy<00:02:04.150> has<00:02:04.300> for

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.570 
and I think he does this guy has for

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:07.410 
and I think he does this guy has for
planetary<00:02:05.080> shields<00:02:05.500> up<00:02:05.620> so<00:02:05.860> now<00:02:06.730> you<00:02:07.210> can<00:02:07.390> see

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420 
planetary shields up so now you can see

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:09.560 
planetary shields up so now you can see
our<00:02:07.570> ship<00:02:07.990> in<00:02:08.140> orbit<00:02:08.350> around<00:02:08.619> his<00:02:08.950> planet

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:09.570 
our ship in orbit around his planet

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:12.000 
our ship in orbit around his planet
sometimes<00:02:10.570> his<00:02:10.780> planet<00:02:11.200> could<00:02:11.410> be<00:02:11.470> cloaked

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 
sometimes his planet could be cloaked

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:14.790 
sometimes his planet could be cloaked
but<00:02:12.640> we<00:02:13.300> look<00:02:13.480> down<00:02:13.630> to<00:02:13.780> the<00:02:13.900> lower<00:02:14.080> right<00:02:14.410> here

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 
but we look down to the lower right here

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.130 
but we look down to the lower right here
and<00:02:15.040> you<00:02:15.150> press<00:02:16.150> the<00:02:16.330> help<00:02:16.480> button<00:02:16.540> that<00:02:16.900> says

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
and you press the help button that says

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.670 
and you press the help button that says
invade<00:02:17.590> the<00:02:17.770> planet<00:02:18.750> so<00:02:19.750> we<00:02:20.020> tap<00:02:20.260> the<00:02:20.470> little

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
invade the planet so we tap the little

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.770 
invade the planet so we tap the little
invasion<00:02:21.130> icon<00:02:21.520> and<00:02:21.790> it<00:02:22.240> says<00:02:22.450> we<00:02:22.630> have

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
invasion icon and it says we have

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.949 
invasion icon and it says we have
captured<00:02:23.050> brilliance<00:02:23.920> for<00:02:24.480> we<00:02:25.480> lost<00:02:25.720> five

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:25.959 
captured brilliance for we lost five

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:27.900 
captured brilliance for we lost five
invaders<00:02:26.470> in<00:02:26.590> the<00:02:26.680> battle<00:02:26.980> and<00:02:27.190> we<00:02:27.490> now<00:02:27.640> have

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 
invaders in the battle and we now have

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:31.290 
invaders in the battle and we now have
31<00:02:28.420> colonies<00:02:28.900> in<00:02:29.050> our<00:02:29.140> Empire<00:02:29.560> and<00:02:30.300> that's

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:31.300 
31 colonies in our Empire and that's

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.330 
31 colonies in our Empire and that's
ours<00:02:31.810> now<00:02:31.959> so<00:02:32.230> we're<00:02:32.380> going<00:02:32.590> to<00:02:32.709> take<00:02:32.890> our<00:02:32.950> ship

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
ours now so we're going to take our ship

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.540 
ours now so we're going to take our ship
out<00:02:33.880> of<00:02:34.209> orbit<00:02:34.390> and<00:02:35.160> we're<00:02:36.160> going<00:02:36.340> to<00:02:36.430> rebuild

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:36.550 
out of orbit and we're going to rebuild

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:40.140 
out of orbit and we're going to rebuild
shields<00:02:37.740> and<00:02:38.740> now<00:02:39.100> we'll<00:02:39.340> leave<00:02:39.520> that<00:02:39.550> planet

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
shields and now we'll leave that planet

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.240 
shields and now we'll leave that planet
and<00:02:40.360> there's<00:02:40.720> our<00:02:40.870> ship<00:02:41.110> again<00:02:41.410> and<00:02:41.740> we'll<00:02:42.100> put

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
and there's our ship again and we'll put

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.180 
and there's our ship again and we'll put
him<00:02:42.430> in<00:02:42.580> kind<00:02:42.880> of<00:02:42.970> a<00:02:43.090> defensive<00:02:43.540> position

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
him in kind of a defensive position

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:47.070 
him in kind of a defensive position
along<00:02:45.190> with<00:02:45.370> this<00:02:45.520> guy<00:02:45.760> and<00:02:46.090> now<00:02:46.870> you'll

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080 
along with this guy and now you'll

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.080 
along with this guy and now you'll
notice<00:02:47.290> that<00:02:47.470> in<00:02:47.980> this<00:02:48.010> system<00:02:48.370> that<00:02:48.730> used<00:02:48.910> to

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
notice that in this system that used to

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:51.630 
notice that in this system that used to
have<00:02:49.300> one<00:02:50.080> planet<00:02:50.590> for<00:02:50.800> the<00:02:50.920> orange<00:02:51.220> species

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
have one planet for the orange species

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.360 
have one planet for the orange species
the<00:02:51.880> Orpha<00:02:52.300> in<00:02:52.480> this<00:02:52.780> case<00:02:53.020> and<00:02:53.350> now<00:02:54.070> our

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
the Orpha in this case and now our

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:56.820 
the Orpha in this case and now our
planets<00:02:55.150> since<00:02:55.810> we<00:02:55.959> have<00:02:56.110> all<00:02:56.260> three<00:02:56.410> planets

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:56.830 
planets since we have all three planets

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:58.560 
planets since we have all three planets
in<00:02:56.980> this<00:02:57.100> system<00:02:57.280> we<00:02:57.610> now<00:02:57.730> control<00:02:58.120> the<00:02:58.360> system

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:58.570 
in this system we now control the system

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:01.470 
in this system we now control the system
and<00:02:58.930> that<00:02:59.190> allows<00:03:00.190> us<00:03:00.400> to<00:03:00.550> build<00:03:00.730> an<00:03:01.090> extra

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
and that allows us to build an extra

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:05.360 
and that allows us to build an extra
ship<00:03:01.690> in<00:03:01.840> our<00:03:01.930> fleet<00:03:02.310> so<00:03:03.330> let's<00:03:04.330> see<00:03:04.510> we

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
ship in our fleet so let's see we

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:09.229 
ship in our fleet so let's see we
show<00:03:05.700> this<00:03:05.879> on<00:03:06.030> the<00:03:06.209> star<00:03:06.450> map<00:03:07.970> sometimes<00:03:08.970> it's

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
show this on the star map sometimes it's

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:11.509 
show this on the star map sometimes it's
good<00:03:09.299> to<00:03:09.450> toggle<00:03:09.780> off<00:03:10.080> the<00:03:10.190> extra<00:03:11.190> information

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:11.519 
good to toggle off the extra information

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:13.789 
good to toggle off the extra information
there's<00:03:12.120> our<00:03:12.269> system<00:03:12.690> so<00:03:12.989> that<00:03:13.019> circled<00:03:13.709> by

00:03:13.789 --> 00:03:13.799 
there's our system so that circled by

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:16.220 
there's our system so that circled by
the<00:03:13.860> white<00:03:14.150> put<00:03:15.150> the<00:03:15.299> other<00:03:15.420> information<00:03:15.750> back

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
the white put the other information back

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:23.110 
the white put the other information back
on<00:03:16.500> and<00:03:17.510> we<00:03:18.510> see<00:03:18.720> that<00:03:18.750> in<00:03:19.310> this<00:03:20.310> area<00:03:20.730> we<00:03:21.290> have

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 
on and we see that in this area we have

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:26.780 
on and we see that in this area we have
started<00:03:24.120> to<00:03:24.299> get<00:03:25.140> a<00:03:25.170> good<00:03:25.379> foothold<00:03:25.860> the<00:03:26.280> Orpha

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
started to get a good foothold the Orpha

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:29.809 
started to get a good foothold the Orpha
are<00:03:27.720> still<00:03:28.250> surrounding<00:03:29.250> us<00:03:29.370> for<00:03:29.549> the<00:03:29.610> most

00:03:29.809 --> 00:03:29.819 
are still surrounding us for the most

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:32.539 
are still surrounding us for the most
part<00:03:30.060> but<00:03:30.569> with<00:03:31.140> this<00:03:31.349> system<00:03:31.980> with<00:03:32.280> three

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:32.549 
part but with this system with three

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:35.660 
part but with this system with three
good<00:03:32.730> planets<00:03:33.829> and<00:03:34.829> two<00:03:35.159> good<00:03:35.370> ships

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670 
good planets and two good ships

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:37.400 
good planets and two good ships
protecting<00:03:36.390> it<00:03:36.540> it's<00:03:36.900> a<00:03:36.989> fairly<00:03:37.200> good

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
protecting it it's a fairly good

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:39.920 
protecting it it's a fairly good
position<00:03:37.829> to<00:03:37.859> be<00:03:38.040> in<00:03:38.069> so<00:03:38.459> that's<00:03:39.299> a<00:03:39.450> sample<00:03:39.840> of

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
position to be in so that's a sample of

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:42.920 
position to be in so that's a sample of
planetary<00:03:40.500> invasion<00:03:40.920> a<00:03:41.640> fairly<00:03:42.359> late<00:03:42.569> stage

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
planetary invasion a fairly late stage

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:45.530 
planetary invasion a fairly late stage
scenario<00:03:43.680> in<00:03:43.950> ascendancy<00:03:44.549> and<00:03:44.790> thanks<00:03:45.480> very

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
scenario in ascendancy and thanks very

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.750 
scenario in ascendancy and thanks very
much
