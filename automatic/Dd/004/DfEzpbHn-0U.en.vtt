a DJ podcast or radio show episode let's
take<00:00:12.210> a<00:00:12.330> listen<00:00:12.480> to<00:00:12.630> an<00:00:12.780> example<00:00:12.840> of<00:00:13.349> a<00:00:13.500> beat

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
take a listen to an example of a beat

repeat<00:00:14.009> effect<00:00:14.460> gone<00:00:14.730> wrong<00:00:15.030> that<00:00:15.450> will

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
repeat effect gone wrong that will

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.050 
repeat effect gone wrong that will
illustrate<00:00:15.750> the<00:00:16.410> kind<00:00:16.859> of<00:00:17.039> mistakes<00:00:17.640> that<00:00:17.910> we

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
illustrate the kind of mistakes that we

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:28.910 
illustrate the kind of mistakes that we
can<00:00:18.300> fix<00:00:18.570> using<00:00:19.080> this<00:00:19.170> technique<00:00:27.590> that<00:00:28.590> sounds

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
can fix using this technique that sounds

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.650 
can fix using this technique that sounds
pretty<00:00:29.039> bad<00:00:29.189> to<00:00:29.730> me<00:00:29.880> so<00:00:30.179> we're<00:00:30.330> going<00:00:30.449> to<00:00:30.539> go

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
pretty bad to me so we're going to go

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.139 
pretty bad to me so we're going to go
ahead<00:00:30.689> and<00:00:31.320> fix<00:00:32.130> this<00:00:32.340> the<00:00:32.820> way<00:00:32.940> that<00:00:33.059> we're

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
ahead and fix this the way that we're

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.479 
ahead and fix this the way that we're
going<00:00:33.239> to<00:00:33.300> do<00:00:33.450> this<00:00:33.630> is<00:00:33.870> by<00:00:34.290> re<00:00:34.620> recording<00:00:35.190> the

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
going to do this is by re recording the

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.799 
going to do this is by re recording the
track<00:00:35.969> and<00:00:36.329> then<00:00:36.840> splice<00:00:37.649> the<00:00:38.040> two<00:00:38.250> together

00:00:38.799 --> 00:00:38.809 
track and then splice the two together

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:41.600 
track and then splice the two together
so<00:00:39.809> you<00:00:39.899> can<00:00:39.989> simply<00:00:40.410> go<00:00:40.680> a<00:00:40.890> little<00:00:41.280> bit<00:00:41.460> down

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
so you can simply go a little bit down

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.060 
so you can simply go a little bit down
in<00:00:41.670> the<00:00:41.910> timeline<00:00:42.530> and<00:00:43.530> then<00:00:43.710> start

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
in the timeline and then start

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.160 
in the timeline and then start
re-recording<00:00:44.510> from<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:45.570> beginning<00:00:45.930> of<00:00:46.020> that

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
re-recording from the beginning of that

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.049 
re-recording from the beginning of that
track<00:00:46.500> when<00:00:47.280> you're<00:00:47.399> done<00:00:47.520> with<00:00:47.550> the<00:00:47.820> latter

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
track when you're done with the latter

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:49.819 
track when you're done with the latter
part<00:00:48.420> of<00:00:48.539> your<00:00:48.600> mix<00:00:48.930> you<00:00:49.110> can<00:00:49.200> simply<00:00:49.440> slice

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
part of your mix you can simply slice

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.200 
part of your mix you can simply slice
the<00:00:49.980> two<00:00:50.100> together<00:00:50.250> and<00:00:50.610> that's<00:00:50.910> what<00:00:51.090> we'll

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
the two together and that's what we'll

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.600 
the two together and that's what we'll
be<00:00:51.300> doing<00:00:51.420> now<00:00:52.350> like<00:00:52.590> any<00:00:52.770> good<00:00:52.949> cooking<00:00:53.340> show

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
be doing now like any good cooking show

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.639 
be doing now like any good cooking show
I've<00:00:53.879> already<00:00:54.149> gone<00:00:54.570> ahead<00:00:54.600> and<00:00:54.899> recorded

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
I've already gone ahead and recorded

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.729 
I've already gone ahead and recorded
this<00:00:56.190> sample<00:00:56.730> again<00:00:57.149> in<00:00:58.140> this<00:00:58.320> scenario<00:00:58.469> I

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
this sample again in this scenario I

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.490 
this sample again in this scenario I
made<00:00:59.129> sure<00:00:59.160> that<00:00:59.609> the<00:00:59.850> recordings<00:01:00.690> start<00:01:01.320> at

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
made sure that the recordings start at

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.799 
made sure that the recordings start at
the<00:01:01.649> very<00:01:01.680> beginning<00:01:02.329> but<00:01:03.329> of<00:01:03.390> course<00:01:03.449> if

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
the very beginning but of course if

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.719 
the very beginning but of course if
you're<00:01:04.019> using<00:01:04.260> two<00:01:04.589> tracks<00:01:04.920> you'll<00:01:05.460> have<00:01:05.549> to

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
you're using two tracks you'll have to

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.880 
you're using two tracks you'll have to
go<00:01:05.850> ahead<00:01:06.090> and<00:01:06.330> line<00:01:06.630> them<00:01:06.869> up<00:01:07.020> yourself<00:01:07.350> it's

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
go ahead and line them up yourself it's

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.500 
go ahead and line them up yourself it's
pretty<00:01:08.189> easy<00:01:08.400> to<00:01:08.580> line<00:01:08.820> them<00:01:09.000> up<00:01:09.090> you<00:01:09.270> need<00:01:09.390> to

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
pretty easy to line them up you need to

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.929 
pretty easy to line them up you need to
simply<00:01:09.869> drag<00:01:10.290> it<00:01:10.409> onto<00:01:10.560> a<00:01:10.740> second<00:01:11.280> track<00:01:11.580> and

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
simply drag it onto a second track and

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.390 
simply drag it onto a second track and
then<00:01:12.390> bring<00:01:12.630> it<00:01:12.750> below<00:01:12.900> and<00:01:13.260> make<00:01:13.950> sure<00:01:14.010> that

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
then bring it below and make sure that

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.990 
then bring it below and make sure that
the<00:01:14.520> waveforms<00:01:15.180> matchup<00:01:16.580> you<00:01:17.580> can<00:01:17.729> do<00:01:17.820> that<00:01:17.939> by

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
the waveforms matchup you can do that by

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.710 
the waveforms matchup you can do that by
simply<00:01:18.619> zooming<00:01:19.619> in<00:01:19.770> and<00:01:20.549> making<00:01:21.180> sure<00:01:21.509> that

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
simply zooming in and making sure that

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.590 
simply zooming in and making sure that
everything<00:01:22.229> looks<00:01:22.259> like<00:01:22.680> it's<00:01:22.860> in<00:01:23.070> place<00:01:23.600> now

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
everything looks like it's in place now

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.499 
everything looks like it's in place now
that<00:01:24.810> we<00:01:24.869> have<00:01:24.900> the<00:01:25.409> two<00:01:25.770> tracks<00:01:26.610> one<00:01:27.180> with<00:01:27.390> the

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
that we have the two tracks one with the

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.140 
that we have the two tracks one with the
good<00:01:27.810> audio<00:01:28.170> and<00:01:28.380> one<00:01:28.500> with<00:01:28.590> the<00:01:28.650> bad<00:01:28.860> audio<00:01:29.150> we

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
good audio and one with the bad audio we

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.149 
good audio and one with the bad audio we
need<00:01:30.299> to<00:01:30.450> make<00:01:30.630> sure<00:01:30.659> that<00:01:31.200> we<00:01:31.350> splice<00:01:31.770> it<00:01:32.009> at

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
need to make sure that we splice it at

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.340 
need to make sure that we splice it at
the<00:01:32.340> right<00:01:32.549> time<00:01:33.150> so<00:01:33.780> what<00:01:33.869> we're<00:01:34.020> going<00:01:34.110> to<00:01:34.200> go

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
the right time so what we're going to go

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.800 
the right time so what we're going to go
and<00:01:34.500> do<00:01:34.650> is<00:01:34.860> solo<00:01:35.850> this<00:01:36.030> track<00:01:36.360> and<00:01:36.600> we're

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
and do is solo this track and we're

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.249 
and do is solo this track and we're
going<00:01:36.930> to<00:01:36.960> listen<00:01:37.290> to<00:01:38.299> hear<00:01:39.299> when<00:01:39.750> everything

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
going to listen to hear when everything

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:46.010 
going to listen to hear when everything
goes<00:01:40.409> wrong

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.109 

okay<00:01:47.020> so<00:01:47.079> it<00:01:47.320> sounds<00:01:47.500> like<00:01:47.740> the<00:01:48.039> first<00:01:48.399> bar<00:01:48.789> is

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:49.119 
okay so it sounds like the first bar is

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:52.350 
okay so it sounds like the first bar is
good<00:01:49.990> and<00:01:50.320> after<00:01:51.009> that<00:01:51.039> things<00:01:51.759> just<00:01:51.880> go<00:01:52.149> awry

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:52.360 
good and after that things just go awry

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.660 
good and after that things just go awry
so<00:01:53.229> we're<00:01:53.380> going<00:01:53.470> to<00:01:53.560> do<00:01:53.680> is<00:01:53.890> leave<00:01:54.250> the<00:01:54.280> first

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:54.670 
so we're going to do is leave the first

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.200 
so we're going to do is leave the first
bar<00:01:54.909> of<00:01:55.180> the<00:01:55.659> first<00:01:56.289> clip<00:01:56.850> so<00:01:57.850> we'll<00:01:58.030> go<00:01:58.179> ahead

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.210 
bar of the first clip so we'll go ahead

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:00.870 
bar of the first clip so we'll go ahead
and<00:01:58.630> just<00:01:59.229> get<00:01:59.530> rid<00:01:59.619> of<00:01:59.710> the<00:01:59.829> rest<00:01:59.979> and<00:02:00.340> then<00:02:00.579> we

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
and just get rid of the rest and then we
