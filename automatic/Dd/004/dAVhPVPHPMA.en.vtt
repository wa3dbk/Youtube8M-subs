 head to head maybe 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:16.000
 access 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.410
 which means 

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:19.440
 these designers

 klépierre lawyers of relatives of amateurs all 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.090
 you are talking about Jesus who is jesus 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:27.040
 and 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:30.040
 it's not too much fate or like that 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.020

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.170
 fujitsu been this person of jesus who who caps him 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:40.750
 in a way it became concrete for shot 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:43.370
 even if sarko 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:45.220
 I was alone in my room 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:47.610
 fight I said to god but 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.610
 coco I wanted to play for him 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:54.420
 what is crazy is that 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.510
 it was there that I could not have anything but it was there 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.770
 the more they were there before me I believe in myself 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:03.630
 and then good 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.850
 my i did not feel davos in may 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.200
 with time I wrote m I started talking to him what 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.419
 I felt 

00:02:12.419 --> 00:02:14.069
 she does not plead in her presence 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:15.489
 not immediately what 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:18.009
 and I paid myself a Bible 

00:02:18.009 --> 00:02:20.119
 I got to know him 

00:02:20.119 --> 00:02:23.119
 is not it a bit of mysticism 

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:27.740
 for 80 'good still need 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:29.060
 I could not any more 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:30.049
 16 

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:33.049
 for me it's not bad to admit to several brands 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:38.219
 I discovered mid-fight alain mebe can not have 

00:02:38.219 --> 00:02:39.899
 and yet 

00:02:39.899 --> 00:02:40.909
 save 

00:02:40.909 --> 00:02:42.289
 sarah do 

00:02:42.289 --> 00:02:44.909
 in two years what his arrival 

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:47.329
 but the best 

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:49.189
 but it's still that but there 

00:02:49.189 --> 00:02:51.109
 in the center of the life of Jesus 

00:02:51.109 --> 00:02:54.919
 there is at his death on a cross what does it mean to you 

00:02:56.369 --> 00:02:59.369
 it's the craziest thing that's already 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:04.189
 I can not understand dutton was in power why there will not be all 

00:03:04.189 --> 00:03:05.179
 fires 

00:03:05.179 --> 00:03:08.239
 because this is the thesis of the war 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:11.549
 what love what at that time 

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:14.729
 same price to secure harm but what has touched me 

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:18.569
 it is that for example - by reading - beginning I tried to do good 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:21.569
 I tried to be a good tool for what but I could not 

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:25.699
 we do not arrive it's not possible there's always something hot and 

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:27.389
 colorful is all 

00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:30.399
 I would have liked to introduce myself to God that it's good 

00:03:30.399 --> 00:03:32.990
 it's located at gers neither door here 

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:35.990
 so not even 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:40.539
 especially Arabs for example we are like that 

00:03:40.539 --> 00:03:41.469
 it's there that 

00:03:41.469 --> 00:03:44.339
 when I realized that poppy lac-à-la-croix 

00:03:44.339 --> 00:03:46.909
 he took my mistakes 

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:50.059
 it's paid for me 

00:03:50.059 --> 00:03:55.089
 too much touch 5 504 touchdowns that actually i have nothing to do to deserve god 

00:03:57.809 --> 00:03:59.379
 8 because skeptics 

00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:02.379
 who loves me is that I do not have that gifts com 

00:04:03.369 --> 00:04:06.109
 what is that at this level 

00:04:06.109 --> 00:04:07.329
 what do you want me to give you 

00:04:07.329 --> 00:04:11.319
 in this thing this accepted and that's what is great it's hard to say 

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:13.819
 to receive something 

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:16.819
 but finally so simple to receive this award 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:22.150
 somehow we had a little common a revelation 

00:04:24.289 --> 00:04:26.129
 I'm not too much for them 

00:04:26.129 --> 00:04:27.590
 I know nothing 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:30.470
 here are people the flaws of the players were lucky but the click 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:31.309
 all that 

00:04:31.309 --> 00:04:34.219
 kill with the help of the assistant 

00:04:34.219 --> 00:04:36.499
 I decided to believe it 

00:04:36.499 --> 00:04:41.159
 she's aware nothing of your steel tra at least with May 18 

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:44.429
 do you have or sign or miracles that shows that it does not 

00:04:44.429 --> 00:04:47.610
 only a view of the mind whatever this jesus but concretely there 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:49.770
 or so yes 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:53.780
 the gggi thing that happened to me what the stuff a little barge what hands 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:54.599
 so much 

00:04:54.599 --> 00:04:58.270
 gold for me I'm not looking at that powerfully not prevented their demons 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:00.259
 really hard in my life 

00:05:00.259 --> 00:05:02.849
 Pérez would have thought it would happen to me badly 

00:05:02.849 --> 00:05:05.619
 but if it happened to me and then but I still felt that he was there to 

00:05:05.619 --> 00:05:07.370
 encourage me 

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:09.319
 it must be said that I find it important 

00:05:09.319 --> 00:05:12.589
 but I did a little bit to them I wandered and then to the neighbor at the 

00:05:12.589 --> 00:05:14.129
 window that explained to me 

00:05:14.129 --> 00:05:17.219
 keith allen even whoever it went more country 

00:05:17.219 --> 00:05:19.919
 it's a little dry everywhere 

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:22.750
 more is with a lively debate as a bonus 

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:26.229
 that sees asking a jet and believer toucy 

00:05:26.229 --> 00:05:28.849
 we took and then as for her 

00:05:28.849 --> 00:05:32.909
 maybe today 4 five minutes after giving birth is an old 

00:05:32.909 --> 00:05:33.559
 lady 

00:05:33.559 --> 00:05:37.149
 a covered - ardenne plateau 1-2 girl and her allies 

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:39.319
 and then was issued 

00:05:39.319 --> 00:05:41.160
 the place per month to his sayings 

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:43.020
 she also took passed 

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:46.339
 stuff like that to win wins it exists it happens sometimes 

00:05:46.339 --> 00:05:48.080
 it does not happen wrong 

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:50.309
 but it's still encouraging 

00:05:50.309 --> 00:05:53.650
 then another example 4 friends to your craft 

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:56.059
 where she counted on greenback trail 

00:05:56.059 --> 00:05:57.189
 absolutely everything 

00:05:57.189 --> 00:05:59.059
 It's France 

00:05:59.059 --> 00:06:00.639
 I do not have a round 

00:06:00.639 --> 00:06:02.870
 r each accreditation 

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:04.909
 100% term 

00:06:04.909 --> 00:06:07.610
 compared to featherweight boxing 

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:11.289
 I said eugenes I will not tell you who made an appointment with the primeur 

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:13.939
 then to europe 

00:06:13.939 --> 00:06:17.199
 with friends we took a lost point that once it's not because we 

00:06:17.199 --> 00:06:19.509
 do not know how to do what 

00:06:19.509 --> 00:06:21.960
 what happened is that you 

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:23.219
 as 

00:06:23.219 --> 00:06:25.339
 I'm on the phone 

00:06:25.339 --> 00:06:28.689
 a dock I did not know 

00:06:28.689 --> 00:06:29.770

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:32.990

 attack 

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:38.849
 Westerwelle 

00:06:38.849 --> 00:06:42.229
 then they told me that I can do for you 

00:06:42.229 --> 00:06:44.869
 it's good 

00:06:44.869 --> 00:06:48.329
 right side to go beat to be a host who is about to celebrate 

00:06:49.189 --> 00:06:50.800
 the train station 

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:52.270
 The answer is yes 

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:55.270
 and he reminded me later he told me ok all the points 

00:06:56.469 --> 00:06:58.939
 I did not know him 

00:06:58.939 --> 00:07:02.110
 to someone who equates to tomatoes with pea who remains very skeptical 

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:05.009
 what would you want to say 

00:07:05.009 --> 00:07:06.849
 is not it losing 

00:07:06.849 --> 00:07:07.879

 the trial of the square 

00:07:20.229 --> 00:07:22.499
 you see he is there 

00:07:22.499 --> 00:07:24.849
 do not see him 

00:07:24.849 --> 00:07:26.779
 and if I can say a word 

00:07:26.779 --> 00:07:29.180
 talking series 

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:30.899

 what changes in you 

00:07:32.619 --> 00:07:35.680
 what changes in turn 

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:36.610
 you have nothing to lose
