00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:09.852
 - Where are you leading me? - Leanne? Can you hear me? 

00:00:10.082 --> 00:00:13.121
 - Brent, what's going on? - Are you okay? Did they hurt you? 

00:00:17.566 --> 00:00:19.051
 Get my wife back there! 

00:00:21.783 --> 00:00:22.977
 Is he alive? 

00:00:24.024 --> 00:00:24.987
 For now. 

00:00:26.497 --> 00:00:29.884
 He'll stay alive as you follow my instructions. 

00:00:31.143 --> 00:00:32.263
 Go! 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:41.939
 I know who you are. 

00:00:42.852 --> 00:00:44.270
 You have a beautiful woman. 

00:00:46.071 --> 00:00:49.025
 And the skills that only a few others have. 

00:00:51.776 --> 00:00:53.984
 And now I have you. 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:57.205
 I'm watching you. 

00:00:57.876 --> 00:00:58.994
 Constantly! 

00:01:00.006 --> 00:01:02.227
 Wait for further instructions. 

00:01:03.821 --> 00:01:06.263
 - Get out! - You found the wrong car. 

00:01:06.962 --> 00:01:08.468
 - Go away now! - I can not! 

00:01:08.468 --> 00:01:10.048
 Go and take it with you! 

00:01:10.418 --> 00:01:11.995
 What do you want me to do with her? 

00:01:12.932 --> 00:01:14.153
 Kill her! 

00:01:17.488 --> 00:01:19.770
 - I'm not a murderer. - All right. 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.990
 You will need her help to get the woman back. 

00:01:25.847 --> 00:01:27.572
 I'll make you an offer. 

00:01:28.812 --> 00:01:31.051
 - What he wants? - I don't know. 

00:01:31.291 --> 00:01:35.164
 Do what I say and your wife will survive. 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:36.763
 She is beautiful. 

00:01:36.963 --> 00:01:39.528
 Reject or be caught 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:42.040
 and is the game over. 

00:01:43.095 --> 00:01:44.295
 He will die. 

00:01:46.767 --> 00:01:48.035
 Time is running. 

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:49.802
 What happens when it's over? 

00:01:49.802 --> 00:01:51.645
 Why would he give it back to you? 

00:01:52.053 --> 00:01:54.256
 For me it looks like a clear decision, 

00:01:54.395 --> 00:01:55.327
 Hold on! 

00:01:57.383 --> 00:02:00.306
 But I'll give you time to think. 

00:02:00.306 --> 00:02:01.780
 I'm not gonna die for you. 

00:02:02.465 --> 00:02:03.167
 Five, 

00:02:05.193 --> 00:02:06.138
 four, 

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:08.638
 three, 

00:02:08.638 --> 00:02:10.833
 I need to know he's okay 

00:02:10.833 --> 00:02:11.623
 two, 

00:02:11.623 --> 00:02:13.435
 and when it will be over. 

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:14.506
 one. 

00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:20.281
 Your answer, Mr. Magno. 

00:02:20.281 --> 00:02:22.463
 I want my wife back. 

00:02:25.353 --> 00:02:27.636
