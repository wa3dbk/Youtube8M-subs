00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:11.129
 it has happened to you that you want to make a 

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:15.860
 chongo with that old sock and then 

00:00:11.129 --> 00:00:18.860
 everything ends up being a great great great 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:18.860
 disaster 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:31.039
 what horror that does not look like a shampoo 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:33.530
 better leave that sock I have a 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:35.780
 trick that you will love what 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:39.270
 you need are only 10 clean pipes looks 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:43.430
 how easy it rolls 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.430
 u2 you roll your hair 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:47.040
 it makes sure 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:52.020
 distributes hair well 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:00.910
 and now you have your perfect chongo 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:03.250
 let's see how it is done 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:08.040
 you take two groups of four of your feet 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:08.040
 clean pipes or eight divided into two 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.380
 well and the meetings that are all over or 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.900
 less at the same height and then you take 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.479
 one of the others and you start rolling it 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.920
 around four so they remain 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:24.659
 safe joints 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.659
 you roll half 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.900
 you arrange them clearly 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.460
 and then you roll the other half 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:41.909
 I have not finished rolling the other half 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:47.789
 in the other 4 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:51.350
 and you roll it up, you roll it up 

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:51.350
 beautiful perfect 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:57.110
 and then once the two are already 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:58.939
 safe parts roll around 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.490
 of all the piece that you have left 

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:03.200
 it's not much and then if you hide the 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:05.210
 tips because those can be done in 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:08.259
 your hair then see that there are no 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:08.259
 many tips 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:14.099
 you fit it well 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:18.180
 and then do the same thing on the other side 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:20.790
 and it will be like that to have a place where 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:23.010
 make sure you're going to take the last clean 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:25.799
 pipes and you'll turn half will you 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:29.319
 to be like a dimple and then what 

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:31.599
 roll up on one side as well as the rest 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:35.379
 but that you have a hole what 

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:38.139
 big enough to put the 

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:39.650
 another end of the live cleaner there is 

00:02:38.139 --> 00:02:42.110
 will throw 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:45.580
 A) Yes 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:45.580
 and there goes your perfect chongo 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:51.010
 now if you want a chongo even more 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:54.970
 nice you need a little bit of bands 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:58.210
 elastic and patience what you have to 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:03:00.190
 do is make a lot of little braids 

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:02.230
 depending on where I roll up I'm 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.270
 how do I start it from below 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:05.590
 I do them at the bottom of the 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:10.440
 hair 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:10.440
 and you make about 10 or 15 little braids 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:18.270
 when they're all ready now if you take 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:20.340
 again bug to make monkeys and 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:22.260
 now if you roll them remembering well 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.450
 where are the braids they need them 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.620
 down so I roll them up this way to this 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:28.000
 side but if it does it upside down 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:30.180
 then towards the other 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.060
 you will do well 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:34.650
 with skill not like me then you're going to 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.930
 accommodating hair and braids 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:39.719
 so they all look and ready 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:41.129
 It looks beautiful in my hair, it does not look 

00:03:39.719 --> 00:03:42.569
 so much because I have very dark hair 

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:44.250
 but I leave this photo 

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:46.560
 So it should be left to you, I hope you have 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:48.750
 liked that it serves them well now in 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.710
 winter time equal between the hair 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:53.740
 collected 

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:57.070
 before fashion then I hope that 

00:03:53.740 --> 00:04:00.150
