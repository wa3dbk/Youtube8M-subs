gran turismo or should know what you're
doing<00:00:16.980> I<00:00:17.160> guess<00:00:17.720> it's<00:00:18.720> a<00:00:18.810> bit<00:00:18.930> different<00:00:19.080> to

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
doing I guess it's a bit different to

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.260 
doing I guess it's a bit different to
set<00:00:19.439> up<00:00:19.529> this<00:00:19.650> time<00:00:19.800> set<00:00:20.670> up<00:00:20.789> just<00:00:20.970> being<00:00:21.119> able

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
set up this time set up just being able

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.150 
set up this time set up just being able
to<00:00:21.449> go<00:00:21.570> into<00:00:21.720> any<00:00:21.930> old<00:00:22.020> race<00:00:22.439> and<00:00:22.769> push<00:00:22.949> base

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
to go into any old race and push base

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.849 
to go into any old race and push base
back<00:00:23.430> now<00:00:24.000> you<00:00:24.060> have<00:00:24.630> you<00:00:25.350> can't<00:00:25.560> just<00:00:25.680> do<00:00:25.830> that

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
back now you have you can't just do that

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.920 
back now you have you can't just do that
y'all<00:00:26.160> have<00:00:26.430> a<00:00:26.580> spec<00:00:26.970> or<00:00:27.119> beast<00:00:27.359> big<00:00:27.539> races

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
y'all have a spec or beast big races

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.349 
y'all have a spec or beast big races
pretty<00:00:28.859> much<00:00:29.039> the<00:00:29.189> game's<00:00:29.400> almost<00:00:29.820> split<00:00:30.240> down

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
pretty much the game's almost split down

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.229 
pretty much the game's almost split down
the<00:00:30.420> middle<00:00:30.660> between<00:00:31.199> a<00:00:31.650> spec<00:00:32.070> and<00:00:32.219> b<00:00:32.340> spec<00:00:32.579> so

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
the middle between a spec and b spec so

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:34.780 
the middle between a spec and b spec so
you<00:00:33.300> do<00:00:33.450> have<00:00:33.540> to<00:00:33.690> do<00:00:33.809> everything<00:00:34.050> twice<00:00:34.320> and

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:34.790 
you do have to do everything twice and

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:38.600 
you do have to do everything twice and
of<00:00:35.790> course<00:00:35.850> well<00:00:36.719> hopefully<00:00:37.469> you're<00:00:38.340> a<00:00:38.370> better

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
of course well hopefully you're a better

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.940 
of course well hopefully you're a better
driver<00:00:38.790> than<00:00:39.000> your<00:00:39.239> b<00:00:39.360> spec<00:00:39.570> driver<00:00:39.870> but<00:00:40.739> this

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
driver than your b spec driver but this

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.830 
driver than your b spec driver but this
means<00:00:41.010> that<00:00:41.550> if<00:00:41.670> you<00:00:41.879> are<00:00:42.059> can<00:00:42.180> only<00:00:42.300> just<00:00:42.660> win

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
means that if you are can only just win

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.810 
means that if you are can only just win
the<00:00:42.989> race<00:00:43.140> then<00:00:43.680> when<00:00:44.070> you<00:00:44.160> go<00:00:44.280> to<00:00:44.340> be<00:00:44.550> spec

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
the race then when you go to be spec

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.880 
the race then when you go to be spec
you're<00:00:45.000> probably<00:00:45.149> going<00:00:45.329> to<00:00:45.390> lose<00:00:45.829> so<00:00:46.829> you

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
you're probably going to lose so you

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.040 
you're probably going to lose so you
will<00:00:47.219> need<00:00:47.460> to<00:00:47.520> have<00:00:47.850> a<00:00:47.879> quikr<00:00:48.180> car<00:00:48.480> than<00:00:48.899> your

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
will need to have a quikr car than your

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.400 
will need to have a quikr car than your
opponents<00:00:49.500> as<00:00:49.950> you<00:00:50.070> can<00:00:50.190> see<00:00:50.370> here<00:00:51.170> I'm<00:00:52.170> not<00:00:52.379> a

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
opponents as you can see here I'm not a

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.939 
opponents as you can see here I'm not a
great<00:00:52.649> deal<00:00:52.860> ahead<00:00:53.219> then<00:00:53.910> I'm<00:00:54.059> in<00:00:54.210> a<00:00:54.270> Corvette

00:00:54.939 --> 00:00:54.949 
great deal ahead then I'm in a Corvette

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:58.849 
great deal ahead then I'm in a Corvette
c6<00:00:55.949> race<00:00:56.399> car<00:00:56.699> and<00:00:56.969> I'm<00:00:57.449> bursting<00:00:57.690> just<00:00:58.170> db9

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
c6 race car and I'm bursting just db9

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.400 
c6 race car and I'm bursting just db9
zand<00:00:59.219> stuff<00:00:59.399> like<00:00:59.579> that<00:01:00.020> really<00:01:01.020> I<00:01:01.050> should<00:01:01.379> be

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
zand stuff like that really I should be

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.520 
zand stuff like that really I should be
you<00:01:01.770> know<00:01:01.890> I<00:01:02.129> should<00:01:02.640> be<00:01:02.789> halfway<00:01:03.750> lap<00:01:04.199> around

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
you know I should be halfway lap around

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.000 
you know I should be halfway lap around
but<00:01:05.519> I've<00:01:05.640> only<00:01:05.729> got<00:01:05.970> a<00:01:06.000> few<00:01:06.150> seconds<00:01:06.510> on<00:01:06.630> them

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:07.010 
but I've only got a few seconds on them

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:11.210 
but I've only got a few seconds on them
so<00:01:08.010> that<00:01:08.340> saying<00:01:09.290> this<00:01:10.290> is<00:01:10.470> because<00:01:10.500> I'm

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
so that saying this is because I'm

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.960 
so that saying this is because I'm
letting<00:01:11.640> get<00:01:11.820> slow<00:01:12.240> now<00:01:13.490> anywhere<00:01:14.490> past<00:01:14.729> that

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
letting get slow now anywhere past that

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.920 
letting get slow now anywhere past that
dot<00:01:15.210> back<00:01:16.310> he's<00:01:17.310> getting<00:01:17.460> drive<00:01:17.790> slow<00:01:18.090> and

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
dot back he's getting drive slow and

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.219 
dot back he's getting drive slow and
probably<00:01:19.740> lose<00:01:20.210> anywhere<00:01:21.210> from<00:01:21.360> there<00:01:21.600> to

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
probably lose anywhere from there to

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.289 
probably lose anywhere from there to
there<00:01:22.439> obviously<00:01:23.130> once<00:01:23.460> it<00:01:23.580> gets<00:01:23.729> really<00:01:23.939> red

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
there obviously once it gets really red

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.090 
there obviously once it gets really red
you'll<00:01:24.930> be<00:01:25.080> pushing<00:01:25.320> it<00:01:25.530> so<00:01:25.770> if<00:01:25.830> you're<00:01:25.950> going

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
you'll be pushing it so if you're going

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.399 
you'll be pushing it so if you're going
quick<00:01:26.460> but<00:01:26.820> there's<00:01:27.570> a<00:01:27.659> more<00:01:27.930> chance<00:01:28.290> of

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
quick but there's a more chance of

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.310 
quick but there's a more chance of
spinning<00:01:28.680> out<00:01:29.100> and<00:01:29.310> crashing<00:01:29.670> and<00:01:30.320> just

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
spinning out and crashing and just

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.810 
spinning out and crashing and just
probably<00:01:31.740> doing<00:01:32.070> worse<00:01:32.250> and<00:01:32.549> you<00:01:32.579> would<00:01:32.729> have

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
probably doing worse and you would have

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.730 
probably doing worse and you would have
done<00:01:32.970> if<00:01:33.090> you<00:01:33.150> just<00:01:33.390> went<00:01:33.509> slow<00:01:33.840> or<00:01:34.439> in<00:01:34.619> the

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
done if you just went slow or in the

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.990 
done if you just went slow or in the
middle<00:01:36.590> then<00:01:37.590> you've<00:01:37.770> got<00:01:37.979> here<00:01:38.430> you<00:01:38.820> can

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
middle then you've got here you can

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.480 
middle then you've got here you can
change<00:01:39.210> how<00:01:39.509> quick<00:01:39.750> you<00:01:39.869> want<00:01:40.049> to<00:01:40.140> drive

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 
change how quick you want to drive

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.620 
change how quick you want to drive
you've<00:01:41.490> got<00:01:41.670> his<00:01:41.790> mental<00:01:42.210> physical<00:01:43.170> strength

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.630 
you've got his mental physical strength

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.780 
you've got his mental physical strength
mental<00:01:45.630> yeah<00:01:46.140> never<00:01:46.770> really<00:01:47.159> ever<00:01:47.280> goes<00:01:47.549> down

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
mental yeah never really ever goes down

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.539 
mental yeah never really ever goes down
that<00:01:47.820> much<00:01:48.149> to<00:01:48.479> West<00:01:48.659> physical<00:01:49.110> now<00:01:50.100> here

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
that much to West physical now here

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.440 
that much to West physical now here
you've<00:01:51.180> got<00:01:51.439> increase<00:01:52.439> maintain<00:01:53.450> decrease

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
you've got increase maintain decrease

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.709 
you've got increase maintain decrease
and<00:01:54.630> overtake<00:01:55.079> now<00:01:55.920> I<00:01:55.950> found<00:01:56.340> if<00:01:56.490> you'll

00:01:56.709 --> 00:01:56.719 
and overtake now I found if you'll

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:59.810 
and overtake now I found if you'll
constantly<00:01:57.719> push<00:01:58.079> overtake<00:01:58.619> you'll<00:01:59.579> actually

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
constantly push overtake you'll actually

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.330 
constantly push overtake you'll actually
slow<00:02:00.479> down<00:02:00.509> so<00:02:01.409> it's<00:02:01.530> better<00:02:01.710> if<00:02:02.070> you're

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
slow down so it's better if you're

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.310 
slow down so it's better if you're
coming<00:02:02.790> fifth<00:02:03.479> or<00:02:03.689> something<00:02:04.020> to<00:02:04.170> do<00:02:04.290> a

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
coming fifth or something to do a
