I'm in today's video I wanted to do a
bit<00:00:05.210> of<00:00:05.240> a<00:00:05.360> comparison<00:00:05.990> and<00:00:06.109> that's<00:00:06.230> comparing

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:06.680 
bit of a comparison and that's comparing

u.s. Sega Saturn model two now there are

00:00:11.539 --> 00:00:13.390 
u.s. Sega Saturn model two now there are
a<00:00:11.570> ton<00:00:12.259> of<00:00:12.289> Saturn's<00:00:12.799> out<00:00:12.980> there<00:00:13.249> especially

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:13.400 
a ton of Saturn's out there especially

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.640 
a ton of Saturn's out there especially
in<00:00:13.969> Japan<00:00:14.119> I<00:00:14.419> mean<00:00:14.719> there's<00:00:14.900> the<00:00:15.079> skeleton

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:15.650 
in Japan I mean there's the skeleton

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:17.740 
in Japan I mean there's the skeleton
Saturn<00:00:16.010> the<00:00:16.160> white<00:00:16.369> Saturn<00:00:16.880> there<00:00:17.359> were<00:00:17.480> so

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:17.750 
Saturn the white Saturn there were so

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:19.599 
Saturn the white Saturn there were so
many<00:00:17.929> different<00:00:18.410> special<00:00:18.769> edition<00:00:19.160> Saturn's

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:19.609 
many different special edition Saturn's

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:21.189 
many different special edition Saturn's
it<00:00:19.789> would<00:00:19.910> take<00:00:20.089> hours<00:00:20.480> to<00:00:20.509> go<00:00:20.779> through<00:00:20.810> them

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:21.199 
it would take hours to go through them

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:23.050 
it would take hours to go through them
all<00:00:21.320> but<00:00:21.859> in<00:00:22.009> today's<00:00:22.130> video<00:00:22.429> I<00:00:22.609> just<00:00:22.849> kind<00:00:23.029> of

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:23.060 
all but in today's video I just kind of

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:24.429 
all but in today's video I just kind of
wanted<00:00:23.240> to<00:00:23.359> concentrate<00:00:23.720> on<00:00:24.080> probably<00:00:24.380> the

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:24.439 
wanted to concentrate on probably the

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:25.839 
wanted to concentrate on probably the
most<00:00:24.740> common<00:00:25.099> ones<00:00:25.279> you're<00:00:25.400> going<00:00:25.519> to<00:00:25.580> see<00:00:25.759> if

00:00:25.839 --> 00:00:25.849 
most common ones you're going to see if

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:26.890 
most common ones you're going to see if
you<00:00:25.939> ever<00:00:26.060> were<00:00:26.240> if<00:00:26.390> you're<00:00:26.509> looking<00:00:26.749> into

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:26.900 
you ever were if you're looking into

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:28.599 
you ever were if you're looking into
getting<00:00:27.079> one<00:00:27.349> of<00:00:27.380> these<00:00:27.560> and<00:00:27.919> those<00:00:28.400> are<00:00:28.550> the

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:28.609 
getting one of these and those are the

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:31.359 
getting one of these and those are the
US<00:00:28.880> models<00:00:29.359> um<00:00:29.539> now<00:00:30.529> like<00:00:30.679> I<00:00:30.769> said<00:00:30.949> there's<00:00:31.099> two

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:31.369 
US models um now like I said there's two

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:33.639 
US models um now like I said there's two
models<00:00:31.759> of<00:00:31.849> the<00:00:31.970> u.s.<00:00:32.210> Saturn<00:00:32.629> these<00:00:33.199> in<00:00:33.500> the

00:00:33.639 --> 00:00:33.649 
models of the u.s. Saturn these in the

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:34.900 
models of the u.s. Saturn these in the
Powell<00:00:33.829> Saturn's<00:00:34.280> are<00:00:34.370> basically<00:00:34.820> identical

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:34.910 
Powell Saturn's are basically identical

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:36.639 
Powell Saturn's are basically identical
to<00:00:35.539> this<00:00:35.690> I<00:00:35.960> mean<00:00:36.140> if<00:00:36.260> you're<00:00:36.350> going<00:00:36.440> to<00:00:36.530> look

00:00:36.639 --> 00:00:36.649 
to this I mean if you're going to look

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:37.779 
to this I mean if you're going to look
into<00:00:36.770> getting<00:00:36.829> a<00:00:37.039> special<00:00:37.370> edition<00:00:37.670> one

00:00:37.779 --> 00:00:37.789 
into getting a special edition one

00:00:37.789 --> 00:00:38.920 
into getting a special edition one
there's<00:00:37.969> like<00:00:38.210> I<00:00:38.300> said<00:00:38.480> there's<00:00:38.629> the<00:00:38.719> Japanese

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:38.930 
there's like I said there's the Japanese

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:41.139 
there's like I said there's the Japanese
models<00:00:39.559> but<00:00:40.190> like<00:00:40.399> I<00:00:40.489> said<00:00:40.550> the<00:00:40.699> most<00:00:40.850> common

00:00:41.139 --> 00:00:41.149 
models but like I said the most common

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:42.279 
models but like I said the most common
ones<00:00:41.270> you're<00:00:41.359> going<00:00:41.480> to<00:00:41.539> find<00:00:41.750> are<00:00:41.899> probably

00:00:42.279 --> 00:00:42.289 
ones you're going to find are probably

00:00:42.289 --> 00:00:44.799 
ones you're going to find are probably
these<00:00:42.559> two<00:00:42.859> now<00:00:43.550> the<00:00:43.609> major<00:00:44.120> differences

00:00:44.799 --> 00:00:44.809 
these two now the major differences

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:47.110 
these two now the major differences
between<00:00:44.870> these<00:00:45.410> systems<00:00:45.649> is<00:00:46.340> at<00:00:46.699> least<00:00:46.879> as<00:00:47.000> far

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:47.120 
between these systems is at least as far

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.660 
between these systems is at least as far
as<00:00:47.180> function<00:00:47.570> go<00:00:47.719> is<00:00:48.050> there<00:00:48.350> is<00:00:48.530> none<00:00:48.859> they

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:49.670 
as function go is there is none they

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:50.950 
as function go is there is none they
basically<00:00:50.000> they'll<00:00:50.449> play<00:00:50.570> all<00:00:50.690> the<00:00:50.809> same

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:50.960 
basically they'll play all the same

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:52.990 
basically they'll play all the same
games<00:00:51.019> they<00:00:51.469> do<00:00:51.530> all<00:00:51.739> the<00:00:51.920> same<00:00:52.070> things<00:00:52.129> the

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:53.000 
games they do all the same things the

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.880 
games they do all the same things the
major<00:00:53.239> differences<00:00:53.780> are<00:00:54.050> cosmetic<00:00:54.559> and

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:54.890 
major differences are cosmetic and

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:57.069 
major differences are cosmetic and
aesthetic<00:00:55.329> now<00:00:56.329> to<00:00:56.390> give<00:00:56.629> you<00:00:56.719> a<00:00:56.780> little<00:00:56.870> bit

00:00:57.069 --> 00:00:57.079 
aesthetic now to give you a little bit

00:00:57.079 --> 00:00:59.860 
aesthetic now to give you a little bit
of<00:00:57.199> a<00:00:57.289> background<00:00:58.149> when<00:00:59.149> Sega<00:00:59.420> launched<00:00:59.690> the

00:00:59.860 --> 00:00:59.870 
of a background when Sega launched the

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.500 
of a background when Sega launched the
system<00:01:00.199> in<00:01:00.289> 1995<00:01:00.949> in<00:01:01.519> the<00:01:01.730> u.s.<00:01:02.089> there<00:01:02.359> was

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:02.510 
system in 1995 in the u.s. there was

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:04.540 
system in 1995 in the u.s. there was
mainly<00:01:02.780> these<00:01:03.620> were<00:01:03.769> they're<00:01:04.129> about<00:01:04.400> the

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:04.550 
mainly these were they're about the

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:05.890 
mainly these were they're about the
first<00:01:04.760> year<00:01:04.940> the<00:01:05.090> model<00:01:05.360> 1<00:01:05.480> was<00:01:05.630> in<00:01:05.660> production

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:05.900 
first year the model 1 was in production

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.500 
first year the model 1 was in production
for<00:01:06.770> 1995<00:01:07.310> into<00:01:07.730> probably<00:01:08.060> about<00:01:08.180> the<00:01:08.300> first

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:08.510 
for 1995 into probably about the first

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:11.800 
for 1995 into probably about the first
half<00:01:08.630> of<00:01:08.870> 1996<00:01:09.800> and<00:01:10.040> the<00:01:10.730> Saturn<00:01:11.120> was<00:01:11.420> a<00:01:11.450> very

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:11.810 
half of 1996 and the Saturn was a very

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:14.170 
half of 1996 and the Saturn was a very
expensive<00:01:12.170> system<00:01:12.650> to<00:01:12.800> manufacture<00:01:13.490> it<00:01:14.000> was

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:14.180 
expensive system to manufacture it was

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:16.810 
expensive system to manufacture it was
launched<00:01:14.480> at<00:01:14.860> $399<00:01:15.860> and<00:01:15.950> you<00:01:16.040> probably<00:01:16.250> if<00:01:16.670> you

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:16.820 
launched at $399 and you probably if you

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:18.610 
launched at $399 and you probably if you
pay<00:01:17.300> attention<00:01:17.420> to<00:01:17.810> history<00:01:18.140> and<00:01:18.290> remember

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:18.620 
pay attention to history and remember

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:22.270 
pay attention to history and remember
that<00:01:18.740> the<00:01:18.830> ps1<00:01:19.130> came<00:01:19.940> out<00:01:20.090> at<00:01:20.210> $2.99<00:01:20.930> so<00:01:21.680> but<00:01:22.040> in

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:22.280 
that the ps1 came out at $2.99 so but in

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.130 
that the ps1 came out at $2.99 so but in
the<00:01:22.400> first<00:01:22.610> 15<00:01:23.060> months<00:01:23.390> of<00:01:23.510> the<00:01:23.600> system's<00:01:23.960> life

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:24.140 
the first 15 months of the system's life

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.020 
the first 15 months of the system's life
between<00:01:24.440> the<00:01:24.950> time<00:01:25.130> the<00:01:25.280> Saturn<00:01:25.610> launched<00:01:25.940> in

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.030 
between the time the Saturn launched in

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:28.330 
between the time the Saturn launched in
May<00:01:26.150> of<00:01:26.180> 95<00:01:26.660> till<00:01:26.990> the<00:01:27.080> time<00:01:27.260> the<00:01:27.410> n64<00:01:27.860> launched

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340 
May of 95 till the time the n64 launched

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.900 
May of 95 till the time the n64 launched
in<00:01:28.460> September<00:01:29.030> of<00:01:29.080> 1996<00:01:30.080> Sega<00:01:30.980> basically<00:01:31.790> had

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:31.910 
in September of 1996 Sega basically had

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:34.840 
in September of 1996 Sega basically had
to<00:01:32.000> slash<00:01:32.270> the<00:01:32.480> Saturn's<00:01:32.840> price<00:01:33.170> in<00:01:33.410> half<00:01:33.850> so

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
to slash the Saturn's price in half so

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:36.700 
to slash the Saturn's price in half so
when<00:01:35.300> you<00:01:35.420> had<00:01:35.570> to<00:01:35.690> cut<00:01:35.840> your<00:01:35.870> systems<00:01:36.380> cost

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:36.710 
when you had to cut your systems cost

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.660 
when you had to cut your systems cost
from<00:01:37.250> 399<00:01:38.030> to<00:01:38.240> $1.99<00:01:38.960> to<00:01:39.110> stay<00:01:39.290> competitive<00:01:39.670> um

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
from 399 to $1.99 to stay competitive um

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:42.640 
from 399 to $1.99 to stay competitive um
that's<00:01:41.120> where<00:01:41.330> Sega<00:01:41.570> really<00:01:41.960> started<00:01:42.320> to<00:01:42.440> hurt

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:42.650 
that's where Sega really started to hurt

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:45.760 
that's where Sega really started to hurt
and<00:01:42.770> bleed<00:01:43.040> a<00:01:43.070> lot<00:01:43.280> of<00:01:43.460> money<00:01:43.720> because<00:01:44.720> the<00:01:45.380> n64

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770 
and bleed a lot of money because the n64

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:46.810 
and bleed a lot of money because the n64
when<00:01:46.100> that<00:01:46.220> was<00:01:46.340> originally

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:46.820 
when that was originally

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:47.800 
when that was originally
getting--getting<00:01:47.240> announced<00:01:47.630> I<00:01:47.780> think

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
getting--getting announced I think

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:49.630 
getting--getting announced I think
Nintendo<00:01:48.080> was<00:01:48.380> planning<00:01:48.650> and<00:01:48.770> doing<00:01:48.830> at<00:01:49.040> 2:49

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 
Nintendo was planning and doing at 2:49

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.530 
Nintendo was planning and doing at 2:49
to<00:01:50.300> 49.99<00:01:51.020> price<00:01:51.440> point<00:01:51.770> and<00:01:51.920> then<00:01:52.580> ps1<00:01:53.300> right

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:53.540 
to 49.99 price point and then ps1 right

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:55.960 
to 49.99 price point and then ps1 right
around<00:01:53.750> the<00:01:53.900> time<00:01:54.080> right<00:01:54.680> before<00:01:55.010> the<00:01:55.550> n64

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:55.970 
around the time right before the n64

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:58.330 
around the time right before the n64
launch<00:01:56.420> dropped<00:01:56.810> the<00:01:56.930> ps1<00:01:57.170> to<00:01:57.470> $1.99<00:01:58.130> so

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:58.340 
launch dropped the ps1 to $1.99 so

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.310 
launch dropped the ps1 to $1.99 so
Nintendo<00:01:58.940> you<00:01:59.540> know<00:01:59.630> dropped<00:01:59.930> its<00:02:00.080> launch

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:00.320 
Nintendo you know dropped its launch

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.500 
Nintendo you know dropped its launch
price<00:02:00.560> to<00:02:00.770> $1.99<00:02:01.400> and<00:02:01.610> Sega<00:02:01.880> unfortunately

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:02.510 
price to $1.99 and Sega unfortunately

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:04.690 
price to $1.99 and Sega unfortunately
had<00:02:02.690> the<00:02:02.930> you<00:02:03.590> know<00:02:03.710> do<00:02:04.130> the<00:02:04.280> same<00:02:04.460> otherwise

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
had the you know do the same otherwise

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.190 
had the you know do the same otherwise
they<00:02:04.940> were<00:02:05.030> going<00:02:05.180> to<00:02:05.240> probably<00:02:05.660> get<00:02:05.960> left<00:02:06.110> in

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
they were going to probably get left in

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:07.430 
they were going to probably get left in
the<00:02:06.260> dust<00:02:06.500> and<00:02:06.650> we<00:02:06.740> all<00:02:06.830> know<00:02:06.980> they<00:02:07.130> kind

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:07.440 
the dust and we all know they kind

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:08.630 
the dust and we all know they kind
did<00:02:07.620> but<00:02:07.860> to<00:02:08.010> state<00:02:08.220> try<00:02:08.400> and<00:02:08.490> stay

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
did but to state try and stay

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.280 
did but to state try and stay
competitive<00:02:08.820> they<00:02:09.210> had<00:02:09.330> to<00:02:09.420> cut<00:02:09.630> the<00:02:09.810> Saturn's

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:10.290 
competitive they had to cut the Saturn's

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:12.230 
competitive they had to cut the Saturn's
price<00:02:10.530> in<00:02:10.710> half<00:02:10.890> within<00:02:11.130> the<00:02:11.310> first<00:02:11.490> 15<00:02:11.880> months

so<00:02:12.780> to<00:02:12.870> help<00:02:13.080> reduce<00:02:13.410> costs<00:02:13.680> they<00:02:14.430> kind<00:02:14.700> of

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:14.820 
so to help reduce costs they kind of

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:18.500 
so to help reduce costs they kind of
went<00:02:15.210> with<00:02:15.390> the<00:02:15.510> model<00:02:15.780> to<00:02:15.960> over<00:02:16.230> here<00:02:16.580> now<00:02:17.580> the

went with the model to over here now the

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:19.970 
went with the model to over here now the
major<00:02:18.690> differences<00:02:19.260> will<00:02:19.410> kind<00:02:19.590> of<00:02:19.650> start<00:02:19.800> on

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
major differences will kind of start on

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.170

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
always kind of curious about where these

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:09.410 
always kind of curious about where these
I<00:03:08.430> don't<00:03:08.670> know<00:03:08.730> might<00:03:08.910> be<00:03:08.940> a<00:03:09.000> little<00:03:09.180> bit<00:03:09.270> tough

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
I don't know might be a little bit tough

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:10.790 
I don't know might be a little bit tough
to<00:03:09.450> see<00:03:09.690> in<00:03:09.780> the<00:03:09.870> video<00:03:10.110> here<00:03:10.170> but<00:03:10.440> they<00:03:10.530> got<00:03:10.680> it

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:10.800 
to see in the video here but they got it

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.190 
to see in the video here but they got it
got<00:03:10.890> these<00:03:11.040> little<00:03:11.310> little<00:03:11.940> divots<00:03:12.420> on<00:03:12.660> the

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
got these little little divots on the

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.530 
got these little little divots on the
model<00:03:13.560> 1<00:03:13.830> and<00:03:14.130> they<00:03:14.550> completely<00:03:15.030> got<00:03:15.150> rid<00:03:15.450> of

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
model 1 and they completely got rid of

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.690 
model 1 and they completely got rid of
those<00:03:15.660> on<00:03:15.870> the<00:03:15.989> model<00:03:16.290> 2<00:03:16.470> now<00:03:17.220> like<00:03:17.520> I<00:03:17.640> said

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
those on the model 2 now like I said

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.220 
those on the model 2 now like I said
they<00:03:17.970> were<00:03:18.060> trying<00:03:18.239> to<00:03:18.360> cut<00:03:18.570> costs<00:03:19.020> so<00:03:19.110> they

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
they were trying to cut costs so they

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.020 
they were trying to cut costs so they
probably<00:03:19.530> just<00:03:19.650> went<00:03:19.950> with<00:03:20.040> all<00:03:20.220> one<00:03:20.520> solid

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
probably just went with all one solid

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:24.229 
probably just went with all one solid
plastic<00:03:21.510> piece<00:03:21.780> on<00:03:22.130> the<00:03:23.130> model<00:03:23.400> 2<00:03:23.610> just<00:03:23.970> when

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
plastic piece on the model 2 just when

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:25.220 
plastic piece on the model 2 just when
they<00:03:24.300> were<00:03:24.330> doing<00:03:24.570> their<00:03:24.750> molds<00:03:25.140> and

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
they were doing their molds and

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:26.540 
they were doing their molds and
everything<00:03:25.590> for<00:03:25.739> the<00:03:25.830> system<00:03:26.190> just<00:03:26.310> to<00:03:26.430> help

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:26.550 
everything for the system just to help

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:28.550 
everything for the system just to help
cut<00:03:26.790> costs<00:03:27.239> so<00:03:27.660> they<00:03:27.750> probably<00:03:27.959> just<00:03:28.110> got<00:03:28.350> rid

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
cut costs so they probably just got rid

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.979 
cut costs so they probably just got rid
of<00:03:28.590> those<00:03:28.709> little<00:03:28.860> divots<00:03:29.340> and<00:03:30.030> honestly<00:03:30.959> I

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:30.989 
of those little divots and honestly I

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:32.270 
of those little divots and honestly I
don't<00:03:31.110> know<00:03:31.290> if<00:03:31.410> it's<00:03:31.530> just<00:03:31.590> like<00:03:31.860> when<00:03:32.160> you're

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
don't know if it's just like when you're

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:33.860 
don't know if it's just like when you're
holding<00:03:32.430> the<00:03:32.670> system<00:03:33.120> down<00:03:33.270> maybe<00:03:33.480> for<00:03:33.750> the

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
holding the system down maybe for the

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:35.600 
holding the system down maybe for the
grip<00:03:34.080> when<00:03:34.230> you're<00:03:34.380> pushing<00:03:35.100> in<00:03:35.190> and<00:03:35.340> out<00:03:35.430> any

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:35.610 
grip when you're pushing in and out any

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:37.520 
grip when you're pushing in and out any
cartridges<00:03:36.239> on<00:03:36.420> the<00:03:36.570> cartridge<00:03:37.080> slots<00:03:37.320> there

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
cartridges on the cartridge slots there

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.770 
cartridges on the cartridge slots there
maybe<00:03:37.709> that's<00:03:37.950> what<00:03:38.130> those<00:03:38.250> were<00:03:38.430> for<00:03:38.459> um<00:03:38.880> and

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
maybe that's what those were for um and

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:41.870 
maybe that's what those were for um and
the<00:03:40.470> cartridge<00:03:40.769> slots<00:03:41.040> are<00:03:41.250> also<00:03:41.400> identical

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
the cartridge slots are also identical

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.130 
the cartridge slots are also identical
now<00:03:42.209> there's<00:03:42.420> a<00:03:42.480> bit<00:03:42.720> of<00:03:42.840> a<00:03:42.900> maybe<00:03:43.050> a

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.140 
now there's a bit of a maybe a

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:44.690 
now there's a bit of a maybe a
misconception<00:03:43.650> with<00:03:43.920> some<00:03:44.100> people<00:03:44.400> out<00:03:44.489> there

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
misconception with some people out there

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:46.640 
misconception with some people out there
that<00:03:44.820> the<00:03:45.330> Saturn<00:03:45.630> can<00:03:45.780> play<00:03:45.930> Genesis<00:03:46.380> games

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
that the Saturn can play Genesis games

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.650 
that the Saturn can play Genesis games
and<00:03:46.860> that's<00:03:46.950> not<00:03:47.220> the<00:03:47.430> case<00:03:47.640> these<00:03:48.239> are<00:03:48.450> mainly

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 
and that's not the case these are mainly

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:50.540 
and that's not the case these are mainly
for<00:03:48.959> memory<00:03:49.260> expansion<00:03:49.650> and<00:03:49.950> stuff<00:03:50.160> like<00:03:50.370> you

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:50.550 
for memory expansion and stuff like you

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:52.280 
for memory expansion and stuff like you
know<00:03:50.670> your<00:03:50.880> your<00:03:51.390> one<00:03:51.600> in<00:03:51.720> for<00:03:51.930> Meg<00:03:52.110> Ram

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
know your your one in for Meg Ram

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:54.590 
know your your one in for Meg Ram
expansions<00:03:53.010> your<00:03:53.190> memory<00:03:53.519> cards<00:03:54.030> you<00:03:54.480> know

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:54.600 
expansions your memory cards you know

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.120 
expansions your memory cards you know
they're<00:03:54.810> great<00:03:55.019> work<00:03:55.200> great<00:03:55.320> for<00:03:55.560> game<00:03:55.739> sharks

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.130 
they're great work great for game sharks

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:58.430 
they're great work great for game sharks
and<00:03:56.280> for<00:03:56.519> pro<00:03:57.000> action<00:03:57.360> replay<00:03:57.720> and<00:03:57.900> whatnot<00:03:58.200> so

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
and for pro action replay and whatnot so

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:01.460 
and for pro action replay and whatnot so
that's<00:03:58.980> mainly<00:03:59.250> what<00:03:59.580> the<00:04:00.230> memory<00:04:01.230> card

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
that's mainly what the memory card

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:03.530 
that's mainly what the memory card
expansion<00:04:02.040> was<00:04:02.190> for<00:04:02.430> in<00:04:02.550> there<00:04:02.730> identical<00:04:03.420> on

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
expansion was for in there identical on

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:05.930 
expansion was for in there identical on
the<00:04:03.739> Saturn<00:04:04.739> there's<00:04:04.950> on<00:04:05.280> both<00:04:05.519> Saturn's

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 
the Saturn there's on both Saturn's

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:07.430 
the Saturn there's on both Saturn's
there's<00:04:06.120> really<00:04:06.239> no<00:04:06.480> difference<00:04:06.870> there's<00:04:07.380> a

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440 
there's really no difference there's a

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.350 
there's really no difference there's a
few<00:04:07.739> other<00:04:07.860> minor<00:04:08.070> cosmetic<00:04:08.459> differences<00:04:09.180> on

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:09.360 
few other minor cosmetic differences on

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:10.520 
few other minor cosmetic differences on
the<00:04:09.480> model<00:04:09.780> one<00:04:09.930> right<00:04:10.110> here<00:04:10.290> you<00:04:10.380> can<00:04:10.500> see

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 
the model one right here you can see

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:12.500 
the model one right here you can see
they<00:04:10.739> kind<00:04:10.860> of<00:04:10.950> got<00:04:11.100> vents<00:04:11.430> and<00:04:11.760> this<00:04:12.209> checks

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510 
they kind of got vents and this checks

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:14.990 
they kind of got vents and this checks
your<00:04:12.660> plastic<00:04:13.230> and<00:04:13.410> on<00:04:13.860> the<00:04:14.010> model<00:04:14.160> 2<00:04:14.519> they

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
your plastic and on the model 2 they

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.969 
your plastic and on the model 2 they
completely<00:04:15.450> eliminated<00:04:16.020> that<00:04:16.109> again<00:04:16.440> just<00:04:16.890> to

00:04:16.969 --> 00:04:16.979 
completely eliminated that again just to

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:19.010 
completely eliminated that again just to
cut<00:04:17.160> costs<00:04:17.549> and<00:04:17.609> everything<00:04:17.780> also<00:04:18.780> on<00:04:18.900> the

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:19.020 
cut costs and everything also on the

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:20.319 
cut costs and everything also on the
model<00:04:19.289> 2

00:04:20.319 --> 00:04:20.329 
model 2

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:22.779 
model 2
they've<00:04:20.689> kind<00:04:20.840> of<00:04:20.959> got<00:04:21.109> the<00:04:21.199> two<00:04:21.520> vents<00:04:22.520> on

00:04:22.779 --> 00:04:22.789 
they've kind of got the two vents on

00:04:22.789 --> 00:04:25.210 
they've kind of got the two vents on
both<00:04:23.180> sides<00:04:23.479> and<00:04:23.720> on<00:04:23.810> the<00:04:23.930> model<00:04:24.110> one<00:04:24.409> there's

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:25.220 
both sides and on the model one there's

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:27.010 
both sides and on the model one there's
one<00:04:25.340> less<00:04:25.729> vent<00:04:26.030> on<00:04:26.240> the<00:04:26.389> left<00:04:26.750> and<00:04:26.930> they've

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:27.020 
one less vent on the left and they've

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:29.529 
one less vent on the left and they've
just<00:04:27.050> got<00:04:27.229> the<00:04:27.409> two<00:04:27.590> vents<00:04:27.919> on<00:04:28.099> the<00:04:28.129> right<00:04:28.490> um

00:04:29.529 --> 00:04:29.539 
just got the two vents on the right um

00:04:29.539 --> 00:04:32.170 
just got the two vents on the right um
the<00:04:29.689> backs<00:04:29.930> are<00:04:30.169> pretty<00:04:30.650> much<00:04:30.889> identical<00:04:31.189> they

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:32.180 
the backs are pretty much identical they

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:33.610 
the backs are pretty much identical they
had<00:04:32.330> the<00:04:32.449> same<00:04:32.659> drawers<00:04:32.960> they<00:04:33.169> have<00:04:33.319> the<00:04:33.439> same

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:38.110 
layouts and everything on you can always
open<00:04:36.949> up<00:04:37.069> the<00:04:37.159> little<00:04:37.370> back<00:04:37.580> here<00:04:37.819> and<00:04:37.909> this<00:04:38.000> is

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:38.120 
open up the little back here and this is

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:40.869 
open up the little back here and this is
where<00:04:38.270> you<00:04:38.449> gain<00:04:38.629> access<00:04:38.900> to<00:04:39.110> the<00:04:39.789> battery<00:04:40.789> and

00:04:40.869 --> 00:04:40.879 
where you gain access to the battery and

00:04:40.879 --> 00:04:42.219 
where you gain access to the battery and
everything<00:04:41.180> and<00:04:41.479> get<00:04:41.569> the<00:04:41.659> dang<00:04:41.810> thing<00:04:42.020> up<00:04:42.110> and

00:04:42.219 --> 00:04:42.229 
everything and get the dang thing up and

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:44.110 
everything and get the dang thing up and
there<00:04:42.349> we<00:04:42.409> go<00:04:42.530> just<00:04:42.710> like<00:04:43.039> there's<00:04:43.490> the<00:04:43.699> it's<00:04:44.060> a

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:44.120 
there we go just like there's the it's a

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:46.990 
there we go just like there's the it's a
cr2032<00:04:44.659> camera<00:04:45.409> battery<00:04:45.800> to<00:04:46.430> power<00:04:46.729> the

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:47.000 
cr2032 camera battery to power the

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.610 
cr2032 camera battery to power the
internal<00:04:47.539> memory<00:04:47.659> and<00:04:47.870> that<00:04:48.050> will<00:04:48.229> die<00:04:48.439> over

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:48.620 
internal memory and that will die over

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:50.529 
internal memory and that will die over
time<00:04:48.979> so<00:04:49.310> you<00:04:49.849> probably<00:04:50.210> are<00:04:50.300> going<00:04:50.389> to<00:04:50.449> want

00:04:50.529 --> 00:04:50.539 
time so you probably are going to want

00:04:50.539 --> 00:04:51.969 
time so you probably are going to want
if<00:04:50.750> you're<00:04:50.870> ever<00:04:50.960> looking<00:04:51.080> together<00:04:51.439> you<00:04:51.770> said

00:04:51.969 --> 00:04:51.979 
if you're ever looking together you said

00:04:51.979 --> 00:04:53.080 
if you're ever looking together you said
and<00:04:52.159> you're<00:04:52.219> going<00:04:52.400> to<00:04:52.430> probably<00:04:52.879> come<00:04:53.060> up

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:53.090 
and you're going to probably come up

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:55.749 
and you're going to probably come up
with<00:04:53.240> a<00:04:54.009> system<00:04:55.009> that's<00:04:55.039> got<00:04:55.310> a<00:04:55.340> dead<00:04:55.610> battery

00:04:55.749 --> 00:04:55.759 
with a system that's got a dead battery

00:04:55.759 --> 00:04:57.939 
with a system that's got a dead battery
unless<00:04:56.120> the<00:04:56.360> seller<00:04:56.750> replaced<00:04:57.259> it<00:04:57.469> and<00:04:57.560> you

00:04:57.939 --> 00:04:57.949 
unless the seller replaced it and you

00:04:57.949 --> 00:04:59.379 
unless the seller replaced it and you
can't<00:04:58.219> really<00:04:58.340> see<00:04:58.460> it<00:04:58.669> in<00:04:58.759> the<00:04:58.819> video<00:04:59.030> but<00:04:59.060> way

00:04:59.379 --> 00:04:59.389 
can't really see it in the video but way

00:04:59.389 --> 00:05:01.270 
can't really see it in the video but way
back<00:04:59.690> in<00:04:59.930> there<00:05:00.080> there's<00:05:00.259> a<00:05:00.319> cartridge<00:05:00.979> slot

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:01.280 
back in there there's a cartridge slot

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:03.399 
back in there there's a cartridge slot
and<00:05:01.550> that<00:05:02.150> cartridge<00:05:02.449> slot<00:05:02.780> allows<00:05:03.110> you<00:05:03.289> to

00:05:03.399 --> 00:05:03.409 
and that cartridge slot allows you to

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:05.649 
and that cartridge slot allows you to
put<00:05:03.650> a<00:05:04.000> cartridge<00:05:05.000> that<00:05:05.150> will<00:05:05.330> either<00:05:05.449> allow

00:05:05.649 --> 00:05:05.659 
put a cartridge that will either allow

00:05:05.659 --> 00:05:08.379 
put a cartridge that will either allow

you to view photo and/or VCDs

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:10.270 
you to view photo and/or VCDs
on<00:05:08.479> that<00:05:09.169> was<00:05:09.319> really<00:05:09.590> only<00:05:09.740> ever<00:05:09.889> a<00:05:10.009> feature

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:10.280 
on that was really only ever a feature

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:12.159 
on that was really only ever a feature
that<00:05:10.580> was<00:05:10.729> kind<00:05:11.030> of<00:05:11.120> used<00:05:11.360> in<00:05:11.509> Japan<00:05:11.810> we<00:05:11.960> never

00:05:12.159 --> 00:05:12.169 
that was kind of used in Japan we never

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:13.860 
that was kind of used in Japan we never
really<00:05:12.440> got<00:05:12.620> anything<00:05:12.860> like<00:05:13.159> that<00:05:13.190> in<00:05:13.490> the<00:05:13.550> US

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:13.870 
really got anything like that in the US

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:18.339 
really got anything like that in the US
but<00:05:14.870> mainly<00:05:16.090> just<00:05:17.090> for<00:05:17.270> you<00:05:17.870> know<00:05:17.960> and<00:05:18.110> extra

00:05:18.339 --> 00:05:18.349 
but mainly just for you know and extra

00:05:18.349 --> 00:05:19.959 
but mainly just for you know and extra
features<00:05:18.650> for<00:05:18.860> the<00:05:18.949> system<00:05:19.310> which<00:05:19.520> is

00:05:19.959 --> 00:05:19.969 
features for the system which is

00:05:19.969 --> 00:05:21.700 
features for the system which is
something<00:05:20.120> the<00:05:20.360> PlayStation<00:05:21.169> really<00:05:21.439> can't

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:21.710 
something the PlayStation really can't

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:24.640 
something the PlayStation really can't
say<00:05:22.639> they<00:05:22.849> had<00:05:23.120> at<00:05:23.419> least<00:05:23.449> not<00:05:24.080> right<00:05:24.319> off<00:05:24.469> the

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:24.650 
say they had at least not right off the

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:26.680 
say they had at least not right off the
bat<00:05:24.860> like<00:05:24.889> a<00:05:25.099> Saturn<00:05:25.490> did<00:05:25.669> and<00:05:25.819> I'm<00:05:26.479> probably

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:26.690 
bat like a Saturn did and I'm probably

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:27.999 
bat like a Saturn did and I'm probably
just<00:05:26.810> going<00:05:26.990> to<00:05:27.080> ignore<00:05:27.289> that<00:05:27.349> drawer<00:05:27.800> because

00:05:27.999 --> 00:05:28.009 
just going to ignore that drawer because

00:05:28.009 --> 00:05:29.080 
just going to ignore that drawer because
it<00:05:28.129> just<00:05:28.250> doesn't<00:05:28.610> want<00:05:28.669> to<00:05:28.789> get<00:05:28.879> in<00:05:28.940> place

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:29.090 
it just doesn't want to get in place

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:30.430 
it just doesn't want to get in place
there<00:05:29.300> we<00:05:29.360> go<00:05:29.479> and<00:05:29.659> one<00:05:30.080> other<00:05:30.229> minor

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:30.440 
there we go and one other minor

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:32.200 
there we go and one other minor
difference<00:05:31.009> is<00:05:31.190> just<00:05:31.219> the<00:05:31.550> model<00:05:31.849> number

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:32.210 
difference is just the model number

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:35.829 
difference is just the model number
obviously<00:05:32.690> on<00:05:32.900> the<00:05:33.370> model<00:05:34.370> -<00:05:34.460> its<00:05:34.639> MK<00:05:34.969> 80,000<00:05:35.659> a

00:05:35.829 --> 00:05:35.839 
obviously on the model - its MK 80,000 a

00:05:35.839 --> 00:05:39.879 
obviously on the model - its MK 80,000 a
and<00:05:36.169> on<00:05:36.830> the<00:05:36.979> model<00:05:37.159> one<00:05:37.490> here<00:05:38.050> it's<00:05:39.050> just<00:05:39.620> MK

00:05:39.879 --> 00:05:39.889 
and on the model one here it's just MK

00:05:39.889 --> 00:05:42.550 
and on the model one here it's just MK
80,000<00:05:40.639> so<00:05:41.210> really<00:05:41.539> those<00:05:41.839> are<00:05:41.870> the<00:05:42.379> major

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:42.560 
80,000 so really those are the major

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:44.980 
80,000 so really those are the major
differences<00:05:43.250> now<00:05:43.789> if<00:05:44.210> you're<00:05:44.419> looking<00:05:44.539> to<00:05:44.810> get

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:44.990 
differences now if you're looking to get

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:48.100 
differences now if you're looking to get
a<00:05:45.050> system<00:05:45.680> here<00:05:45.979> um<00:05:46.330> really<00:05:47.330> like<00:05:47.659> I<00:05:47.779> said<00:05:47.810> as

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:48.110 
a system here um really like I said as

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:49.809 
a system here um really like I said as
far<00:05:48.139> as<00:05:48.289> functionality<00:05:49.009> goes<00:05:49.039> there's<00:05:49.639> no

00:05:49.809 --> 00:05:49.819 
far as functionality goes there's no

00:05:49.819 --> 00:05:53.290 
far as functionality goes there's no
difference<00:05:51.339> it's<00:05:52.339> mainly<00:05:52.610> just<00:05:52.909> what<00:05:53.180> you

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:53.300 
difference it's mainly just what you

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:55.659 
difference it's mainly just what you
come<00:05:53.539> down<00:05:53.779> to<00:05:54.080> think<00:05:54.319> looks<00:05:54.710> better<00:05:55.009> I'm<00:05:55.279> like

00:05:55.659 --> 00:05:55.669 
come down to think looks better I'm like

00:05:55.669 --> 00:05:57.070 
come down to think looks better I'm like
I<00:05:55.789> said<00:05:55.940> I'm<00:05:56.089> a<00:05:56.120> bigger<00:05:56.360> fan<00:05:56.599> of<00:05:56.629> the<00:05:56.779> look<00:05:56.960> at

00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:57.080 
I said I'm a bigger fan of the look at

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:58.990 
I said I'm a bigger fan of the look at
the<00:05:57.169> model<00:05:57.409> on<00:05:57.560> I<00:05:57.800> kind<00:05:58.339> of<00:05:58.400> really<00:05:58.610> like<00:05:58.789> the

00:05:58.990 --> 00:05:59.000 
the model on I kind of really like the

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.879 
the model on I kind of really like the

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:06.040 
like the lines a little bit better just
aesthetically<00:06:05.419> it's<00:06:05.629> a<00:06:05.690> little<00:06:05.839> bit<00:06:05.930> more

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:06.050 
aesthetically it's a little bit more

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:10.809 
aesthetically it's a little bit more
pleasing<00:06:06.319> than<00:06:06.500> the<00:06:06.710> model<00:06:06.979> 2<00:06:08.259> you<00:06:09.259> may<00:06:09.819> see

00:06:10.809 --> 00:06:10.819 
pleasing than the model 2 you may see

00:06:10.819 --> 00:06:13.029 
pleasing than the model 2 you may see
the<00:06:11.089> model<00:06:11.479> 2<00:06:11.690> a<00:06:11.719> little<00:06:12.319> bit<00:06:12.469> more<00:06:12.620> often<00:06:12.800> than

00:06:13.029 --> 00:06:13.039 
the model 2 a little bit more often than

00:06:13.039 --> 00:06:14.619 
the model 2 a little bit more often than
the<00:06:13.099> model<00:06:13.400> 1<00:06:13.520> there's<00:06:13.699> really<00:06:13.909> one's<00:06:14.389> not

00:06:14.619 --> 00:06:14.629 
the model 1 there's really one's not

00:06:14.629 --> 00:06:16.510 
the model 1 there's really one's not
more<00:06:14.870> uncommon<00:06:15.289> than<00:06:15.620> the<00:06:15.740> other<00:06:15.889> the<00:06:16.490> only

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:16.520 
more uncommon than the other the only

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:19.360 
more uncommon than the other the only
reason<00:06:17.060> I<00:06:17.180> say<00:06:17.419> that<00:06:17.449> is<00:06:17.900> because<00:06:18.199> by<00:06:18.889> the<00:06:18.949> time

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:19.370 
reason I say that is because by the time

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:21.879 
reason I say that is because by the time
Sega<00:06:20.300> started<00:06:20.779> doing<00:06:21.020> they<00:06:21.110> had<00:06:21.259> their<00:06:21.409> the

Graham<00:07:42.349> cart<00:07:43.280> there<00:07:43.460> for<00:07:43.669> production<00:07:44.300> replay

00:07:44.589 --> 00:07:44.599 
Graham cart there for production replay

00:07:44.599 --> 00:07:46.659 
Graham cart there for production replay
for<00:07:44.659> playing<00:07:45.110> imports<00:07:45.530> but<00:07:45.949> yeah<00:07:46.220> you<00:07:46.580> won't

00:07:46.659 --> 00:07:46.669 
for playing imports but yeah you won't

00:07:46.669 --> 00:07:48.670 
for playing imports but yeah you won't
see<00:07:46.909> that<00:07:46.940> switch<00:07:47.330> normally<00:07:47.780> on<00:07:47.990> honest<00:07:48.470> on<00:07:48.650> a

00:07:48.670 --> 00:07:48.680 
see that switch normally on honest on a

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:50.589 
see that switch normally on honest on a
none<00:07:48.889> modded<00:07:49.280> Saturn<00:07:49.669> you<00:07:50.240> know<00:07:50.360> and<00:07:50.449> then<00:07:50.539> I

00:07:50.589 --> 00:07:50.599 
none modded Saturn you know and then I

00:07:50.599 --> 00:07:51.850 
none modded Saturn you know and then I
think<00:07:50.750> about<00:07:50.930> the<00:07:51.020> Saturn<00:07:51.380> is<00:07:51.500> that<00:07:51.650> it's<00:07:51.800> very

00:07:51.850 --> 00:07:51.860 
think about the Saturn is that it's very

00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:54.580 
think about the Saturn is that it's very
import<00:07:52.610> friendly<00:07:53.030> so<00:07:53.240> there<00:07:53.840> you<00:07:53.960> guys<00:07:54.080> go<00:07:54.139> on

00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:54.590 
import friendly so there you guys go on

00:07:54.590 --> 00:07:56.710 
import friendly so there you guys go on
hopefully<00:07:55.340> again<00:07:55.760> you<00:07:55.909> learn<00:07:56.060> something<00:07:56.570> and

00:07:56.710 --> 00:07:56.720 
hopefully again you learn something and

00:07:58.629 --> 00:07:58.639 
you know those are the major differences

00:07:58.639 --> 00:08:00.100

00:08:07.089 --> 00:08:07.099 
I mean for a 32-bit system it was very

00:08:07.099 --> 00:08:08.920 
I mean for a 32-bit system it was very
underrated<00:08:07.430> otherwise<00:08:08.240> you<00:08:08.479> guys<00:08:08.599> take<00:08:08.900> it
