00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:04.409
 RC introduced for you today 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.180
 This is the NEO SCORCHER Tamiya model. 

00:00:08.379 --> 00:00:13.749
 It is TT-02B. 

00:00:13.749 --> 00:00:16.599
 This is the latest carriage. 

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:19.369
 It is suitable for beginners and says either 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:24.140
 It is a mid-level entry level for off-road vehicles. 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:26.399
 Because this car is a four-wheel drive 

00:00:26.399 --> 00:00:29.939
 Excellent handling is easy 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.540
 I will give a brief introduction 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:36.630
 Body I am in red 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.410
 The standard is blue 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:42.160
 I want everyone to have different colors. 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:45.140
 When it comes to competition 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:45.729
 If it is a standard color 

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:49.699
 Because I don’t know my car. 

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:50.640
 I am in red 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.720
 This is the same color as the hot shot 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:59.120
 I like 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:04.320
 I will clear the body 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.020
 It has become like 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.380
 Here, I put the battery 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:15.020
 The battery was selected as Nika ~ Tsu City Battery 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.000
 Is 2000 mAh 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.960
 In addition, there is lithium ion ten-day nickel-hydrogen 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:28.960
 I think the most obedient in nickel-cadmium batteries 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.820
 Is suspended 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:36.420
 Oil damper and double wishbone 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:39.470
 It is like this 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:42.970
 Differential gear is normal 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:45.990
 No difference in one ball 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.630
 Because there is a differential gear, when idling 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:52.750
 You surround the tire in the opposite direction 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:57.050
 Recently RC is an amplifier unlike the past 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:04.330
 Only one servo is turning 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:08.020
 Modification 

00:02:08.299 --> 00:02:10.479
 Single aluminum shaft 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:13.689
 I have put the aluminum shaft 

00:02:13.689 --> 00:02:15.299
 Jack joint 

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:17.829
 I am recommending this 

00:02:17.829 --> 00:02:19.489
 The bearing is very replaced later 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:23.399
 When you replace the motor, what is absolutely needed is the future. 

00:02:23.399 --> 00:02:25.639
 It is best to exchange first 

00:02:25.639 --> 00:02:30.019
 Car is GT tune 

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:32.969
 At first, it must be in normal operation of the motor 

00:02:32.969 --> 00:02:36.189
 Very slow 

00:02:36.189 --> 00:02:38.239
 For speed, and being replaced 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:42.230
 Matching, we replaced the pinion 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.029
 Different amplitude 

00:02:46.029 --> 00:02:49.809
 Speed ​​is much faster now 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:58.869
 We did about 30 kilometers per hour until now, now it is about 45 kilometers per hour. 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:01.979
 This is fast and fun 

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:04.699
 Who is the power of the motor? 

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:06.430
 You can drift 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.980
 Control is also very interesting 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.279
 Suggest 

00:03:11.279 --> 00:03:15.299
 PROPO chooses SANWA MXV 

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:18.159
 Although it is getting cheaper 

00:03:18.159 --> 00:03:21.939
 I think those who are in this class are a good one 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:27.440
 The capabilities of the amplifier are different 

00:03:27.779 --> 00:03:31.129
 If you choose this, 

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:35.269
 I can respond to the electric motor 

00:03:35.589 --> 00:03:40.269
 After a long time, I was surprised by RC. 

00:03:40.539 --> 00:03:43.739
 I think I am a 2.4GHz band. 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:45.919
 No antenna 

00:03:45.919 --> 00:03:48.859
 Is the number PROPO 

00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:51.949
 When you turn on the power supply 

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:54.449
 I can set various 

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:57.749
 Is a high performance 

00:03:57.749 --> 00:04:00.369
 I have so much trouble. 

00:04:00.369 --> 00:04:05.259
 I want to turn on the power 

00:04:05.259 --> 00:04:09.779
 Test run 

00:04:09.779 --> 00:04:12.579
 The steering wheel looks like 

00:04:12.579 --> 00:04:19.579
 Moving fast 

00:04:29.439 --> 00:04:32.659
 Four-wheel drive is impressive 

00:04:32.659 --> 00:04:34.639
 Introduced only today 

00:04:34.849 --> 00:04:36.580
 Also, in the days to come, I will travel 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:39.439
 The next time, I will introduce the run. 

00:04:39.439 --> 00:04:41.139
 And I see the last 

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:42.909
 Thank you 

00:04:42.909 --> 00:04:48.930
 Subscribe thank you 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:49.689
 Goodbye
