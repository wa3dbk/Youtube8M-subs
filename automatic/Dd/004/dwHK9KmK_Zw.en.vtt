00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
be able to take a mountain off to try a

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.319

clean track or pickup derail trains or

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.869 
clean track or pickup derail trains or
whatnot<00:00:51.660> so<00:00:52.170> I<00:00:52.770> kept<00:00:53.160> like<00:00:53.340> that<00:00:53.610> because

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
whatnot so I kept like that because

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.130 
whatnot so I kept like that because
you're<00:00:54.149> not<00:00:54.239> going<00:00:54.449> to<00:00:54.510> be<00:00:54.570> able<00:00:54.600> to<00:00:54.780> see<00:00:54.960> from

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
you're not going to be able to see from

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.979 
you're not going to be able to see from
this<00:00:55.410> side<00:00:55.620> anyway<00:00:56.219> and<00:00:56.489> on<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.510> opposite

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
this side anyway and on the opposite

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.189 
this side anyway and on the opposite
side<00:00:58.230> it'll<00:00:58.649> make<00:00:58.800> it<00:00:58.980> much<00:00:59.340> much<00:00:59.879> easier<00:01:00.199> to

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
side it'll make it much much easier to

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:06.050 
side it'll make it much much easier to
get<00:01:01.440> two<00:01:01.829> trains<00:01:02.789> in<00:01:03.589> this<00:01:04.589> area<00:01:05.010> over<00:01:05.070> here<00:01:05.460> I

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
get two trains in this area over here I

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.240 
get two trains in this area over here I
got<00:01:06.600> a<00:01:06.630> little<00:01:06.689> bit<00:01:07.020> of<00:01:07.049> work<00:01:07.320> right<00:01:07.950> here<00:01:08.010> on

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
got a little bit of work right here on

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
lights in it you probably can't really

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.060 
lights in it you probably can't really
see<00:01:15.240> it<00:01:15.420> but<00:01:15.450> it<00:01:15.780> came<00:01:15.930> out<00:01:16.140> really<00:01:16.380> good<00:01:16.530> and

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
if my DCC system was set up right now I

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.560 
if my DCC system was set up right now I
would<00:01:19.650> turn<00:01:19.830> out<00:01:19.860> and<00:01:20.100> show<00:01:20.250> you<00:01:20.310> but<00:01:21.150> I<00:01:21.210> don't

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.649 
have installed some LED light things on
the<00:01:29.100> bottom<00:01:29.460> of<00:01:29.520> this<00:01:29.670> building<00:01:30.210> and<00:01:30.450> there

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
the bottom of this building and there

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.899 
the bottom of this building and there
will<00:01:30.780> be<00:01:30.810> lighted<00:01:31.350> up<00:01:31.409> pretty<00:01:31.740> soon<00:01:31.979> so

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
will be lighted up pretty soon so

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.429 
will be lighted up pretty soon so
that'll<00:01:33.150> be<00:01:33.240> pretty<00:01:33.450> nice<00:01:33.720> I'd<00:01:34.049> to<00:01:34.200> get<00:01:34.350> my

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
that'll be pretty nice I'd to get my

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.649 
that'll be pretty nice I'd to get my
structures<00:01:34.979> and<00:01:35.220> scenery<00:01:35.490> really<00:01:36.000> going<00:01:36.390> here

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
structures and scenery really going here

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.399 
structures and scenery really going here
because<00:01:37.049> I<00:01:37.670> don't<00:01:38.670> really<00:01:38.759> have<00:01:38.850> that<00:01:39.390> much<00:01:40.259> of

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
because I don't really have that much of

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.020 
because I don't really have that much of
a<00:01:40.470> complete<00:01:40.829> layout<00:01:41.100> right<00:01:41.280> now<00:01:41.490> I've<00:01:41.820> been

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
a complete layout right now I've been

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.149 
a complete layout right now I've been
going<00:01:42.210> as<00:01:42.390> for<00:01:42.689> what<00:01:42.899> five<00:01:43.229> years<00:01:43.590> now<00:01:43.829> or

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
going as for what five years now or

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.310 
going as for what five years now or
forward<00:01:44.820> actually<00:01:45.180> and<00:01:45.689> I've<00:01:45.869> only<00:01:46.020> gotten

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
forward actually and I've only gotten

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.350 
forward actually and I've only gotten
that<00:01:46.619> far<00:01:46.979> I<00:01:47.310> mean<00:01:47.640> I've<00:01:47.790> done<00:01:47.909> lots<00:01:48.090> of

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
that far I mean I've done lots of

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.840 
that far I mean I've done lots of
changes<00:01:48.630> and<00:01:48.990> things<00:01:49.020> like<00:01:49.320> that<00:01:49.380> but<00:01:49.829> still<00:01:50.579> I

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
changes and things like that but still I

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.639 
changes and things like that but still I
really<00:01:51.509> personally<00:01:52.020> think<00:01:52.290> that<00:01:52.350> I<00:01:52.470> could

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
really personally think that I could

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:57.069 
really personally think that I could
have<00:01:52.950> gone<00:01:53.070> farther<00:01:53.460> by<00:01:53.729> now<00:01:53.939> but<00:01:54.659> from<00:01:55.409> I

00:01:57.069 --> 00:01:57.079 
have gone farther by now but from I

00:01:57.079 --> 00:01:59.569 
have gone farther by now but from I
money<00:01:58.079> and<00:01:58.320> stuff<00:01:58.649> for<00:01:58.979> I<00:01:59.189> guess<00:01:59.430> you<00:01:59.549> could

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
money and stuff for I guess you could

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.300 
money and stuff for I guess you could
say<00:01:59.729> lack<00:02:00.030> of<00:02:00.299> funds<00:02:00.719> not<00:02:01.590> really<00:02:01.799> lack<00:02:02.070> of

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
say lack of funds not really lack of

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.010 
say lack of funds not really lack of
funds<00:02:02.490> but<00:02:02.820> I<00:02:03.000> spent<00:02:03.420> my<00:02:03.509> money<00:02:03.659> on<00:02:03.840> other

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
funds but I spent my money on other

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.130 
funds but I spent my money on other
things<00:02:04.280> not<00:02:05.280> really<00:02:05.640> my<00:02:05.820> hobby<00:02:06.360> like<00:02:06.719> trains

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
things not really my hobby like trains

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.219 
things not really my hobby like trains
or<00:02:07.380> RC<00:02:08.310> airplanes<00:02:08.640> or<00:02:08.789> anything<00:02:09.000> like<00:02:09.030> that

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229

there<00:02:26.310> um<00:02:26.519> I<00:02:27.409> installed<00:02:28.409> one<00:02:29.129> ground<00:02:29.430> throw

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
there um I installed one ground throw

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.270 
there um I installed one ground throw
and<00:02:30.060> I<00:02:30.810> ripped<00:02:31.019> up<00:02:31.170> all<00:02:31.319> the<00:02:31.440> rest<00:02:31.620> are<00:02:31.769> here

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
and I ripped up all the rest are here

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.520 
and I ripped up all the rest are here
because<00:02:32.700> I<00:02:33.239> didn't<00:02:33.959> like<00:02:34.080> how<00:02:34.349> they're

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
because I didn't like how they're

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.580 
because I didn't like how they're
placing<00:02:35.099> or<00:02:35.310> redo<00:02:35.610> them<00:02:35.849> I<00:02:36.060> also<00:02:36.780> install<00:02:37.349> some

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
placing or redo them I also install some

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.000 
placing or redo them I also install some
wires<00:02:37.830> on<00:02:38.280> these<00:02:38.670> on<00:02:38.910> rail<00:02:39.569> part<00:02:40.290> things<00:02:40.709> here

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
wires on these on rail part things here

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.569 
wires on these on rail part things here
so<00:02:41.879> that<00:02:42.120> trains<00:02:42.510> can<00:02:42.870> go<00:02:43.019> easier<00:02:43.739> over<00:02:44.370> them

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:44.579 
so that trains can go easier over them

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:50.479 
so that trains can go easier over them
more<00:02:45.030> easily<00:02:45.239> I<00:02:45.810> guess<00:02:46.290> and<00:02:47.030> yeah<00:02:48.030> I<00:02:48.810> also<00:02:49.489> use

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
more easily I guess and yeah I also use

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:54.050 
more easily I guess and yeah I also use
