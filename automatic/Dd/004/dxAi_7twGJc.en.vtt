hour<00:00:55.530> p.m.<00:00:55.830> and<00:00:56.070> then<00:00:56.670> I'm<00:00:56.820> just<00:00:57.000> showing<00:00:57.150> my

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
hour p.m. and then I'm just showing my

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.299 
hour p.m. and then I'm just showing my
top<00:00:57.600> my<00:00:57.780> three<00:00:57.989> top<00:00:58.170> sets<00:00:58.559> of<00:00:58.799> the<00:00:58.949> bench<00:00:59.100> press

top my three top sets of the bench press

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.789 
top my three top sets of the bench press
but<00:00:59.580> i<00:00:59.640> actually<00:00:59.820> did<00:01:00.059> 23<00:01:00.570> work<00:01:00.960> sets<00:01:01.260> of<00:01:01.559> those

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:01.799 
but i actually did 23 work sets of those

00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:04.969 
but i actually did 23 work sets of those
so<00:01:02.189> check<00:01:02.220> out<00:01:02.580> the<00:01:02.989> how<00:01:03.989> that<00:01:04.229> all<00:01:04.439> went<00:01:04.619> in

five by five at overhead press on this
135<00:01:10.619> was<00:01:10.740> a<00:01:10.770> little<00:01:10.979> more<00:01:11.100> ambitious<00:01:11.520> than<00:01:11.549> i

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
135 was a little more ambitious than i

135 was a little more ambitious than i
wanted<00:01:11.970> a<00:01:12.060> key<00:01:12.299> and<00:01:12.450> so<00:01:12.570> I<00:01:12.600> dropped<00:01:12.869> back<00:01:13.020> on<00:01:13.200> to

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:13.640 
wanted a key and so I dropped back on to

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.039 
wanted a key and so I dropped back on to
115<00:01:14.640> and<00:01:14.909> then<00:01:15.060> I<00:01:15.090> moved<00:01:15.360> back<00:01:15.420> over<00:01:15.600> to<00:01:15.960> the

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
115 and then I moved back over to the

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.960 
115 and then I moved back over to the
deadlift<00:01:16.530> and<00:01:16.740> these<00:01:16.950> were<00:01:17.100> just<00:01:17.220> incredibly

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
deadlift and these were just incredibly

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:23.840 
deadlift and these were just incredibly
intense<00:01:19.850> 585<00:01:20.850> for<00:01:21.299> two<00:01:21.450> triples<00:01:21.869> and<00:01:22.850> double

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
intense 585 for two triples and double

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.749 
intense 585 for two triples and double
is<00:01:24.000> at<00:01:24.270> six<00:01:24.630> fifteen<00:01:24.920> for<00:01:25.920> two<00:01:26.100> cents<00:01:26.369> and<00:01:26.579> then

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
is at six fifteen for two cents and then

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.499 
is at six fifteen for two cents and then
I<00:01:26.789> felt<00:01:27.749> like<00:01:27.869> it<00:01:28.049> was<00:01:28.170> a<00:01:28.200> little<00:01:28.409> more<00:01:29.509> without

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
I felt like it was a little more without

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.599 
I felt like it was a little more without
the<00:01:30.780> felt<00:01:30.990> I<00:01:31.170> felt<00:01:31.200> like<00:01:31.499> I<00:01:31.679> was<00:01:31.829> losing<00:01:32.100> a

00:01:32.599 --> 00:01:32.609 
the felt I felt like I was losing a

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:35.599 
the felt I felt like I was losing a
little<00:01:32.820> bit<00:01:32.999> of<00:01:33.950> the<00:01:34.950> bar<00:01:35.130> speed<00:01:35.399> that<00:01:35.549> I

00:01:35.599 --> 00:01:35.609 
little bit of the bar speed that I

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:37.370 
little bit of the bar speed that I
really<00:01:35.939> wanted<00:01:36.240> to<00:01:36.299> keep<00:01:36.539> these<00:01:36.749> I<00:01:36.780> and<00:01:37.200> so

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
really wanted to keep these I and so

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.989 
really wanted to keep these I and so
after<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:37.829> two<00:01:37.950> sets<00:01:38.189> of<00:01:38.280> six<00:01:38.490> fifteen<00:01:38.850> I

00:01:38.989 --> 00:01:38.999 
after the two sets of six fifteen I

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:41.480 
after the two sets of six fifteen I
dropped<00:01:39.210> it<00:01:39.270> down<00:01:39.359> to<00:01:39.509> 605<00:01:39.810> and<00:01:40.350> then<00:01:41.009> again<00:01:41.310> to

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
dropped it down to 605 and then again to

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.559 
dropped it down to 605 and then again to
595<00:01:42.450> to<00:01:42.810> keep<00:01:43.020> the<00:01:43.229> bar<00:01:43.409> speed<00:01:43.649> up<00:01:44.299> to<00:01:45.299> the

00:01:45.559 --> 00:01:45.569 
595 to keep the bar speed up to the

00:01:45.569 --> 00:01:47.660 
595 to keep the bar speed up to the
range<00:01:45.780> that<00:01:45.869> I<00:01:46.049> have<00:01:46.229> to<00:01:46.499> and<00:01:46.829> I<00:01:47.219> will<00:01:47.490> just

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
range that I have to and I will just

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.010 
range that I have to and I will just
straight<00:01:47.909> up<00:01:47.939> say<00:01:48.210> I<00:01:48.240> am<00:01:48.479> absolutely<00:01:48.659> loving

from<00:02:12.170> my<00:02:12.349> last<00:02:12.590> session<00:02:12.860> but<00:02:13.849> I<00:02:14.120> was<00:02:14.299> able<00:02:14.450> to

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
from my last session but I was able to

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.069 
from my last session but I was able to
do<00:02:14.900> a<00:02:15.110> lot<00:02:15.170> more<00:02:15.470> than<00:02:16.220> I<00:02:17.120> expected<00:02:17.239> and<00:02:17.810> even

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:18.079 
do a lot more than I expected and even

00:02:18.079 --> 00:02:19.449 
do a lot more than I expected and even
on<00:02:18.170> those<00:02:18.260> bench<00:02:18.530> drops<00:02:18.829> as<00:02:19.010> I<00:02:19.129> dropped<00:02:19.340> all

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:19.459 
on those bench drops as I dropped all

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:21.309 
on those bench drops as I dropped all
the<00:02:19.489> way<00:02:19.579> down<00:02:19.819> i<00:02:19.849> think<00:02:20.180> i<00:02:20.239> did<00:02:20.360> 240<00:02:20.900> for<00:02:21.200> my

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:21.319 
the way down i think i did 240 for my

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:23.740 
the way down i think i did 240 for my
final<00:02:21.709> set<00:02:21.920> of<00:02:21.950> 8<00:02:22.340> reps<00:02:22.640> all<00:02:22.939> the<00:02:23.269> one<00:02:23.480> count

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
final set of 8 reps all the one count

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:28.030 
final set of 8 reps all the one count
pause<00:02:24.189> and<00:02:26.379> if<00:02:27.379> I<00:02:27.500> would<00:02:27.620> have<00:02:27.680> just<00:02:27.739> followed

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
pause and if I would have just followed

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:29.860 
pause and if I would have just followed
the<00:02:28.220> regular<00:02:28.579> percentage<00:02:29.060> that<00:02:29.329> the<00:02:29.450> program

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
the regular percentage that the program

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.660 
the regular percentage that the program
would<00:02:30.170> recommend<00:02:30.650> that<00:02:30.860> last<00:02:31.250> set<00:02:31.489> would<00:02:31.579> have

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 
would recommend that last set would have

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:33.759 
would recommend that last set would have
been<00:02:31.790> down<00:02:31.940> at<00:02:32.090> 185<00:02:32.599> so<00:02:33.019> you<00:02:33.079> can<00:02:33.319> you<00:02:33.590> can

00:02:33.759 --> 00:02:33.769 
been down at 185 so you can you can

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:35.680 
been down at 185 so you can you can
