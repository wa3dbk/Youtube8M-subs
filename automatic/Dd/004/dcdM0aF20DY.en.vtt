 let's move on to the keyboard which 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:28.920
 is presented in a very sober design and 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:30.780
 elegant the surface is made in

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.410
 to see 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:37.410
 we can also note the presence of the 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:40.560
 red mx classes below the 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:43.349

 uppercase is a LED for the caps lock 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:11.250
 were we told the design a lot 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:14.069
 elegant so it lends itself very well to 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:18.480
 any desk the surface 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:21.359
 bottom is completely plastic is 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:25.109
 present a slot for the usb cable 

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:27.239
 which, however, is not a retractable type 

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:31.919
 integrated into the keyboard body e 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:34.530
 there are two rises to favor 

00:03:31.919 --> 00:03:39.680

 er.it we say of the keyboard that varies 

00:03:45.419 --> 00:03:51.030
 from a minimum of 40 to a maximum of 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:54.389
 miller therefore the bios voice may also 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:56.000
 deceive as I wanted 

00:03:54.389 --> 00:03:59.490
