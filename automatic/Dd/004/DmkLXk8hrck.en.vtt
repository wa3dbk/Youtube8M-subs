00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.469 
number sounds familiar to you it's
because<00:01:43.859> that<00:01:44.249> is<00:01:44.490> the<00:01:44.670> resolution<00:01:44.969> of<00:01:45.390> the

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
because that is the resolution of the

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.440 
because that is the resolution of the
current<00:01:46.020> 9.7<00:01:46.829> inch<00:01:46.890> ipads<00:01:47.399> but<00:01:48.060> if<00:01:48.299> you<00:01:48.420> think

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
current 9.7 inch ipads but if you think

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.690 
current 9.7 inch ipads but if you think
about<00:01:48.780> it<00:01:48.960> taking<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:49.619> resolution<00:01:50.189> of<00:01:50.369> a

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
about it taking the resolution of a

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.719 
about it taking the resolution of a
device<00:01:51.119> that's<00:01:51.149> almost<00:01:51.950> 10<00:01:52.950> inches<00:01:52.979> in<00:01:53.520> size

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
device that's almost 10 inches in size

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.450 
device that's almost 10 inches in size
and<00:01:54.060> putting<00:01:54.390> an<00:01:54.479> on<00:01:54.630> a<00:01:54.659> device<00:01:55.170> that<00:01:55.409> is<00:01:55.890> 8

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
and putting an on a device that is 8

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.550 
and putting an on a device that is 8
inches<00:01:56.490> in<00:01:57.119> size<00:01:57.329> those<00:01:57.810> pixels<00:01:58.259> are<00:01:58.380> going<00:01:58.499> to

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
inches in size those pixels are going to

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:59.840 
inches in size those pixels are going to
be<00:01:58.679> packed<00:01:58.920> much<00:01:59.249> tighter<00:01:59.549> together

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
be packed much tighter together

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.120 
be packed much tighter together
resulting<00:02:00.270> in<00:02:00.630> an<00:02:00.749> even<00:02:01.109> sharper<00:02:01.380> screen<00:02:01.770> of

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
resulting in an even sharper screen of

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.289 
resulting in an even sharper screen of
course<00:02:02.429> there's<00:02:02.609> no<00:02:02.670> way<00:02:02.909> to<00:02:02.969> know<00:02:03.060> whether

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
course there's no way to know whether

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:04.789 
course there's no way to know whether
this<00:02:03.509> is<00:02:03.569> true<00:02:03.719> or<00:02:03.990> not<00:02:04.049> but<00:02:04.200> I<00:02:04.409> think<00:02:04.649> it<00:02:04.770> is

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
this is true or not but I think it is

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.559 
this is true or not but I think it is
pretty<00:02:05.069> safe<00:02:05.340> to<00:02:05.369> say<00:02:05.520> that<00:02:05.670> the<00:02:05.969> ipad<00:02:06.090> mini<00:02:06.329> 2

00:02:06.559 --> 00:02:06.569 
pretty safe to say that the ipad mini 2

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:09.499 
pretty safe to say that the ipad mini 2
will<00:02:06.990> feature<00:02:07.259> retina<00:02:07.799> display<00:02:08.190> as<00:02:08.429> you<00:02:09.390> know

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
will feature retina display as you know

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:10.999 
will feature retina display as you know
all<00:02:09.539> the<00:02:09.840> reviews<00:02:10.140> state<00:02:10.410> that<00:02:10.590> that's<00:02:10.800> really

all the reviews state that that's really

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.440 
all the reviews state that that's really
