handles<00:00:45.760> that<00:00:45.940> he<00:00:46.330> had<00:00:46.480> two<00:00:46.750> handles<00:00:47.309> so<00:00:48.309> there

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:48.460 
handles that he had two handles so there

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:49.590 
handles that he had two handles so there
wasn't<00:00:48.610> chance<00:00:48.850> of<00:00:48.970> grabbing<00:00:49.120> the<00:00:49.300> wrong<00:00:49.390> one

one way to open the back latch and a

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:02.920 
little bit farther the same way and then

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.670 
little bit farther the same way and then
the<00:01:03.070> back<00:01:03.250> blacks<00:01:03.579> lifted<00:01:04.030> the<00:01:04.089> front<00:01:04.330> latch

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
the back blacks lifted the front latch

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.620 
the back blacks lifted the front latch
to<00:01:05.680> release<00:01:05.710> your<00:01:06.039> animal<00:01:06.369> so<00:01:07.119> if<00:01:07.210> an<00:01:07.300> animal

what<00:01:09.190> you<00:01:09.310> prefer<00:01:09.690> the<00:01:10.690> momentum<00:01:11.289> of<00:01:11.440> the<00:01:11.560> back

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:11.740 
what you prefer the momentum of the back

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.160 
what you prefer the momentum of the back
latch<00:01:12.009> lifted<00:01:12.520> the<00:01:12.580> front<00:01:12.789> latch<00:01:13.000> and<00:01:13.899> that

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:14.170 
latch lifted the front latch and that

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:16.710 
latch lifted the front latch and that
animal<00:01:14.530> didn't<00:01:14.710> even<00:01:14.830> slow<00:01:15.009> down<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:16.600> way

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:16.720 
animal didn't even slow down the way

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.139 
animal didn't even slow down the way
this<00:01:16.899> is<00:01:17.080> set<00:01:17.289> up<00:01:17.430> whichever<00:01:18.430> way<00:01:18.670> your<00:01:18.820> handle

00:01:19.139 --> 00:01:19.149 
this is set up whichever way your handle

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:23.270 
this is set up whichever way your handle
goes<00:01:19.350> you<00:01:20.350> push<00:01:20.560> it<00:01:20.710> ahead<00:01:20.860> to<00:01:21.820> open<00:01:21.850> ahead

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
goes you push it ahead to open ahead

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.199 
goes you push it ahead to open ahead
first<00:01:24.280> of<00:01:24.399> all<00:01:24.490> you<00:01:24.610> can't<00:01:24.789> grab<00:01:25.000> the<00:01:25.030> wrong

00:01:25.199 --> 00:01:25.209 
first of all you can't grab the wrong

00:01:25.209 --> 00:01:26.719 
first of all you can't grab the wrong
handle<00:01:25.569> because<00:01:25.660> there's<00:01:25.869> only<00:01:25.990> one<00:01:26.200> here

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
handle because there's only one here

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.260 
handle because there's only one here
push<00:01:27.729> it<00:01:27.880> back<00:01:28.060> and<00:01:28.869> the<00:01:28.929> head<00:01:29.050> gate<00:01:29.229> goes<00:01:29.410> back

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
push it back and the head gate goes back

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.120 
push it back and the head gate goes back
so<00:01:31.270> it's<00:01:31.420> very<00:01:31.539> simple<00:01:31.959> short<00:01:32.530> learning<00:01:32.920> curve

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.130 
so it's very simple short learning curve

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:40.100 
so it's very simple short learning curve
to<00:01:33.160> run<00:01:33.429> this<00:01:33.550> head<00:01:33.759> gate<00:01:33.940> a<00:01:37.319> very<00:01:38.319> simple

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
to run this head gate a very simple

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.740 
to run this head gate a very simple

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:46.330 
open your head gate fall out just nicely

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:47.820 
open your head gate fall out just nicely
take<00:01:46.690> the<00:01:46.810> slack<00:01:46.989> out<00:01:47.229> of<00:01:47.349> this<00:01:47.440> chain<00:01:47.649> and

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:32.270 
this heavy aid is actually simpler I

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:34.660 
this heavy aid is actually simpler I
think<00:02:32.870> for<00:02:33.590> catching<00:02:33.920> horns<00:02:34.160> people<00:02:34.460> used<00:02:34.610> to

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
think for catching horns people used to

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:35.890 
think for catching horns people used to
say<00:02:34.820> you<00:02:34.880> had<00:02:35.060> to<00:02:35.120> have<00:02:35.240> a<00:02:35.270> scissor<00:02:35.570> head<00:02:35.750> gate

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
say you had to have a scissor head gate

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:37.690 
say you had to have a scissor head gate
to<00:02:36.020> catch<00:02:36.140> his<00:02:36.290> out<00:02:36.410> of<00:02:36.440> horns<00:02:36.740> well<00:02:37.550> that's

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
to catch his out of horns well that's

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.370 
to catch his out of horns well that's
her<00:02:38.000> head<00:02:38.150> gate<00:02:38.330> you<00:02:38.480> had<00:02:38.660> that<00:02:38.780> much<00:02:38.990> neck<00:02:39.200> and

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.380 
her head gate you had that much neck and

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:40.750 
her head gate you had that much neck and
you<00:02:39.440> had<00:02:39.620> to<00:02:39.740> hit<00:02:39.860> your<00:02:40.130> timing<00:02:40.490> had<00:02:40.580> to<00:02:40.670> be

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
you had to hit your timing had to be

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.060 
you had to hit your timing had to be
perfect<00:02:41.180> to<00:02:41.930> get<00:02:42.050> behind<00:02:42.200> the<00:02:42.500> horns<00:02:42.740> in<00:02:42.860> front

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:43.070 
perfect to get behind the horns in front

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:44.560 
perfect to get behind the horns in front
of<00:02:43.130> the<00:02:43.190> shoulder<00:02:43.490> on<00:02:43.640> the<00:02:43.730> as<00:02:44.000> the<00:02:44.120> animal<00:02:44.450> was

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:44.570 
of the shoulder on the as the animal was

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:48.670 
of the shoulder on the as the animal was
coming<00:02:44.840> through<00:02:44.960> at<00:02:45.140> 22<00:02:46.100> miles<00:02:46.340> an<00:02:46.490> hour<00:02:47.680> this

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
coming through at 22 miles an hour this

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.340 
coming through at 22 miles an hour this
one<00:02:49.240> there<00:02:50.240> come<00:02:50.420> in<00:02:50.600> all<00:02:50.780> I<00:02:50.840> gotta<00:02:51.050> do<00:02:51.140> is<00:02:51.260> get

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:51.350 
one there come in all I gotta do is get

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:52.780 
one there come in all I gotta do is get
behind<00:02:51.530> the<00:02:51.830> horns<00:02:52.070> if<00:02:52.190> the<00:02:52.280> animals<00:02:52.640> still

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
behind the horns if the animals still

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:54.070 
behind the horns if the animals still
come<00:02:53.030> and<00:02:53.180> the<00:02:53.270> shoulders<00:02:53.630> will<00:02:53.750> finish<00:02:53.930> the

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.080 
come and the shoulders will finish the

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.560 
come and the shoulders will finish the
catch<00:02:54.260> for<00:02:54.470> me<00:02:54.550> so<00:02:55.550> I<00:02:55.580> think<00:02:55.760> it<00:02:56.150> takes<00:02:56.300> less

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:56.570 
catch for me so I think it takes less

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:58.150 
catch for me so I think it takes less

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:30.290 
down so when they drop it you run this

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:32.260 
down so when they drop it you run this
over<00:03:30.590> top<00:03:30.770> of<00:03:30.800> their<00:03:31.040> neck<00:03:31.190> when<00:03:31.970> they<00:03:32.060> drop
