has rose first Avengers movie line this

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.590 
has rose first Avengers movie line this
is<00:01:19.590> essentially<00:01:20.250> the<00:01:20.400> same<00:01:20.640> figure<00:01:21.150> the<00:01:21.390> head

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
is essentially the same figure the head

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:22.940 
is essentially the same figure the head
sculpts<00:01:21.960> a<00:01:22.020> little<00:01:22.259> bit<00:01:22.380> different<00:01:22.830> doesn't

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
sculpts a little bit different doesn't

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.560 
sculpts a little bit different doesn't
have<00:01:23.189> the<00:01:23.340> sunglasses<00:01:23.820> and<00:01:24.119> the<00:01:24.330> paint

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
have the sunglasses and the paint

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.210 
have the sunglasses and the paint
applications<00:01:25.170> a<00:01:25.320> little<00:01:25.560> bit<00:01:25.680> different<00:01:26.100> but

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
applications a little bit different but

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.070 
applications a little bit different but
otherwise<00:01:26.460> it's<00:01:26.880> exactly<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.600> same<00:01:27.810> figure

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
otherwise it's exactly the same figure

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.260 
otherwise it's exactly the same figure
so<00:01:29.009> with<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:29.310> head<00:01:29.490> sculpt<00:01:29.790> does<00:01:29.970> this<00:01:30.090> that

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
so with the head sculpt does this that

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.210 
so with the head sculpt does this that
you<00:01:30.360> don't<00:01:30.570> get<00:01:30.750> this<00:01:30.900> sunglasses<00:01:31.710> I<00:01:31.920> think

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
you don't get this sunglasses I think

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.590 
you don't get this sunglasses I think
they've<00:01:32.340> done<00:01:32.369> a<00:01:32.520> pretty<00:01:32.729> good<00:01:32.850> job<00:01:33.000> with<00:01:33.180> it<00:01:33.570> I

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
they've done a pretty good job with it I

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.300 
they've done a pretty good job with it I
think<00:01:33.840> it<00:01:33.960> captures<00:01:34.140> the<00:01:34.409> overall<00:01:34.890> likeness

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
think it captures the overall likeness

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.060 
think it captures the overall likeness
of<00:01:35.549> Jeremy<00:01:35.970> Renner<00:01:36.150> the<00:01:37.020> eyes<00:01:37.200> are<00:01:37.590> painted<00:01:37.799> so

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
of Jeremy Renner the eyes are painted so

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.740 
of Jeremy Renner the eyes are painted so
he's<00:01:38.220> kind<00:01:38.430> of<00:01:38.460> looking<00:01:38.640> off<00:01:38.939> to<00:01:38.970> the<00:01:39.150> side<00:01:39.270> so

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
he's kind of looking off to the side so

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:40.969 
he's kind of looking off to the side so
he's<00:01:39.869> kind<00:01:40.079> of<00:01:40.110> almost<00:01:40.320> got<00:01:40.590> this<00:01:40.740> like

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
he's kind of almost got this like

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.100 
he's kind of almost got this like
paranoid<00:01:41.490> look<00:01:41.670> like<00:01:41.850> he's<00:01:42.000> expecting<00:01:42.869> maybe

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
paranoid look like he's expecting maybe

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.749 
paranoid look like he's expecting maybe
Quicksilver<00:01:43.799> to<00:01:43.920> come<00:01:44.040> up<00:01:44.189> and<00:01:44.399> knock<00:01:44.579> him

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
Quicksilver to come up and knock him

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.190 
Quicksilver to come up and knock him
over<00:01:44.909> from<00:01:45.240> behind<00:01:45.509> or<00:01:45.750> something<00:01:45.840> I<00:01:46.140> don't

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
over from behind or something I don't

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.780 
over from behind or something I don't
know<00:01:46.350> but<00:01:46.649> I<00:01:47.159> think<00:01:47.430> it<00:01:47.490> would<00:01:47.579> have<00:01:47.670> probably

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
know but I think it would have probably

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.789 
know but I think it would have probably
been<00:01:48.000> better<00:01:48.360> if<00:01:48.570> they<00:01:48.750> had<00:01:48.840> made<00:01:49.049> the<00:01:49.200> eyes<00:01:49.380> so

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
been better if they had made the eyes so

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.679 
been better if they had made the eyes so
he<00:01:50.100> was<00:01:50.340> looking<00:01:50.670> more<00:01:50.850> full<00:01:51.119> straight<00:01:51.540> ahead

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
he was looking more full straight ahead

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.990 
he was looking more full straight ahead
but<00:01:52.470> otherwise<00:01:52.740> I<00:01:53.100> think<00:01:53.159> the<00:01:53.399> head<00:01:53.549> sculpt<00:01:53.880> is

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
but otherwise I think the head sculpt is

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.160 
but otherwise I think the head sculpt is
pretty<00:01:54.210> good<00:01:54.420> I<00:01:54.479> like<00:01:54.780> the<00:01:54.930> paint

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
pretty good I like the paint

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.530 
pretty good I like the paint
applications<00:01:55.890> I<00:01:56.009> like<00:01:56.189> the<00:01:56.340> darker<00:01:56.759> maroon

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
applications I like the darker maroon

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.899 
applications I like the darker maroon
purple<00:01:58.259> type<00:01:58.649> color<00:01:58.890> that<00:01:59.159> they've<00:01:59.310> used<00:01:59.340> it's

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
purple type color that they've used it's

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.120 
purple type color that they've used it's
more<00:02:00.210> true<00:02:00.420> to<00:02:00.540> what<00:02:00.689> we<00:02:00.840> see<00:02:01.020> in<00:02:01.049> the<00:02:01.350> Avengers

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
more true to what we see in the Avengers

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.940 
more true to what we see in the Avengers
age<00:02:02.280> of<00:02:02.399> Ultron<00:02:02.520> movie<00:02:03.030> I<00:02:03.450> like<00:02:04.259> the<00:02:04.409> texturing

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
age of Ultron movie I like the texturing

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.530 
age of Ultron movie I like the texturing
on<00:02:05.100> the<00:02:05.250> outfit<00:02:05.670> which<00:02:05.850> again<00:02:06.180> that's<00:02:06.390> the

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
and everything so overall I think this

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:52.930

figure<00:02:51.920> looks<00:02:52.310> good

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
figure looks good

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:54.790 
figure looks good
now<00:02:53.330> I<00:02:53.360> will<00:02:53.630> say<00:02:53.870> that<00:02:54.170> I<00:02:54.320> think<00:02:54.350> it<00:02:54.650> would

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:54.800 
now I will say that I think it would

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.560 
now I will say that I think it would
have<00:02:54.860> been<00:02:54.920> nice<00:02:55.310> if<00:02:55.640> they<00:02:55.940> had<00:02:55.970> included

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:56.570 
have been nice if they had included

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:58.120 
have been nice if they had included
something<00:02:56.780> like<00:02:57.020> the<00:02:57.170> jacket<00:02:57.650> that<00:02:57.800> we<00:02:57.950> see

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.130 
something like the jacket that we see

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:00.090 
something like the jacket that we see
him<00:02:58.250> wearing<00:02:58.670> in<00:02:58.940> the<00:02:59.210> age<00:02:59.420> of<00:02:59.600> Ultron<00:02:59.960> movie

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.100 
him wearing in the age of Ultron movie

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.320 
him wearing in the age of Ultron movie
especially<00:03:01.100> if<00:03:01.160> they<00:03:01.310> had<00:03:01.400> made<00:03:01.550> it<00:03:01.730> removable

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:02.330 
especially if they had made it removable

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:03.820 
especially if they had made it removable
so<00:03:02.480> you<00:03:02.510> could<00:03:02.690> have<00:03:02.870> it<00:03:03.020> with<00:03:03.050> the<00:03:03.320> jacket<00:03:03.560> or

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:03.830 
so you could have it with the jacket or

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:06.100 
so you could have it with the jacket or
without<00:03:04.130> I<00:03:04.520> think<00:03:05.180> that<00:03:05.330> would<00:03:05.540> have<00:03:05.660> made

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:06.110 
without I think that would have made

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:08.230 
without I think that would have made
this<00:03:06.350> figure<00:03:06.770> you<00:03:07.550> know<00:03:07.640> would<00:03:07.910> have<00:03:07.970> added

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:08.240 
this figure you know would have added

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:10.810 
this figure you know would have added
extra<00:03:09.080> peel<00:03:09.710> to<00:03:09.920> people<00:03:10.220> already<00:03:10.400> have<00:03:10.640> the

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:10.820 
extra peel to people already have the

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:12.430 
extra peel to people already have the
Hawkeye<00:03:11.270> figure<00:03:11.570> from<00:03:11.660> the<00:03:11.810> first<00:03:12.020> Avengers

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 
Hawkeye figure from the first Avengers

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.230 
Hawkeye figure from the first Avengers
movie<00:03:12.470> line<00:03:12.950> you<00:03:13.580> know<00:03:13.670> make<00:03:13.910> it<00:03:13.940> more

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:14.240 
movie line you know make it more

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:17.110 
movie line you know make it more
different<00:03:15.140> differentiated<00:03:16.100> a<00:03:16.190> bit<00:03:16.370> more<00:03:16.610> so<00:03:17.090> I

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
different differentiated a bit more so I

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:18.310 
different differentiated a bit more so I
think<00:03:17.210> it<00:03:17.480> would<00:03:17.540> have<00:03:17.630> been<00:03:17.690> nice<00:03:17.930> if<00:03:17.960> they

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:18.320 
think it would have been nice if they

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:20.410 
think it would have been nice if they
had<00:03:18.350> included<00:03:18.860> that<00:03:19.010> jacket<00:03:19.550> it<00:03:19.820> I<00:03:20.090> don't

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:20.420 
had included that jacket it I don't

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:21.850 
had included that jacket it I don't
actually<00:03:20.600> have<00:03:20.870> the<00:03:21.080> Hawkeye<00:03:21.260> figure<00:03:21.740> from

in the back of the figure so you just
plug<00:04:00.050> it<00:04:00.230> in<00:04:00.380> and<00:04:01.390> then<00:04:02.390> he's<00:04:02.540> got<00:04:02.750> that

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:07.910 
of hawkeye figures and again it's just

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:11.050 
of hawkeye figures and again it's just
all<00:04:08.240> black<00:04:08.570> it's<00:04:09.230> got<00:04:09.500> the<00:04:09.710> little<00:04:10.060> flexible

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:11.060 
all black it's got the little flexible

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:16.930 
all black it's got the little flexible
plastic<00:04:12.880> wire<00:04:13.880> for<00:04:14.630> the<00:04:14.720> bowstring<00:04:15.230> and<00:04:15.940> he

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:16.940 
plastic wire for the bowstring and he

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:18.700 
plastic wire for the bowstring and he
can<00:04:17.090> hold<00:04:17.330> the<00:04:17.480> bow<00:04:17.660> in<00:04:17.870> either<00:04:18.109> hand<00:04:18.410> though

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:18.710 
can hold the bow in either hand though

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:20.380 
can hold the bow in either hand though
it's<00:04:18.890> better<00:04:19.130> suited<00:04:19.430> for<00:04:19.700> him<00:04:19.820> to<00:04:19.970> hold<00:04:20.150> it<00:04:20.270> in

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:20.390 
it's better suited for him to hold it in

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:23.350 
it's better suited for him to hold it in
his<00:04:20.540> right<00:04:20.720> hand<00:04:21.550> now<00:04:22.550> again<00:04:22.880> I<00:04:22.910> think<00:04:23.120> it

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:23.360 
his right hand now again I think it

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:24.310 
his right hand now again I think it
would<00:04:23.479> have<00:04:23.540> been<00:04:23.600> cool<00:04:23.840> if<00:04:23.960> they'd<00:04:24.110> maybe

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:24.320 
would have been cool if they'd maybe

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:26.530 
would have been cool if they'd maybe
added<00:04:24.860> like<00:04:25.280> maybe<00:04:25.669> that<00:04:25.910> air

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:26.540 
added like maybe that air

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:28.720 
added like maybe that air
that<00:04:27.020> multiple<00:04:27.530> arrow<00:04:27.830> thing<00:04:28.160> that<00:04:28.400> he<00:04:28.490> pulls

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:28.730 
that multiple arrow thing that he pulls

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:30.400 
that multiple arrow thing that he pulls
out<00:04:28.940> when<00:04:29.150> he's<00:04:29.240> talking<00:04:29.420> to<00:04:29.660> Scarlet<00:04:30.260> Witch

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:30.410 
out when he's talking to Scarlet Witch

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:32.110 
out when he's talking to Scarlet Witch
in<00:04:30.650> the<00:04:30.740> movie<00:04:31.070> just<00:04:31.340> again<00:04:31.640> to<00:04:31.820> give<00:04:31.970> it

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:32.120 
in the movie just again to give it

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:33.520 
in the movie just again to give it
something<00:04:32.450> they'll<00:04:32.600> differentiate<00:04:33.230> it<00:04:33.410> a

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:33.530 
something they'll differentiate it a

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:35.380 
something they'll differentiate it a
little<00:04:33.710> bit<00:04:33.920> more<00:04:34.160> from<00:04:34.550> the<00:04:34.730> first<00:04:34.970> Hawk<00:04:35.210> I

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:04.150 
be Captain America is a little bit
taller<00:05:02.000> than<00:05:02.360> Hawkeye<00:05:02.780> so<00:05:03.530> overall<00:05:03.950> I<00:05:04.070> would

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:04.160 
taller than Hawkeye so overall I would

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:05.650 
taller than Hawkeye so overall I would
say<00:05:04.220> the<00:05:04.460> scale<00:05:04.670> works<00:05:04.880> pretty<00:05:05.090> good<00:05:05.210> between

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:05.660 
say the scale works pretty good between

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:09.010 
say the scale works pretty good between
these<00:05:05.810> two<00:05:05.990> and<00:05:07.030> then<00:05:08.030> of<00:05:08.180> course<00:05:08.210> Thor<00:05:08.780> is

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:09.020 
these two and then of course Thor is

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:11.140 
these two and then of course Thor is
much<00:05:09.230> taller<00:05:09.530> than<00:05:09.680> Hawkeye<00:05:10.190> again<00:05:10.790> as<00:05:11.000> he

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:11.150 
much taller than Hawkeye again as he

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:11.740 
much taller than Hawkeye again as he
should<00:05:11.360> be

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:11.750 
should be

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:16.270 
should be
as<00:05:12.100> is<00:05:13.100> the<00:05:13.280> Hulk<00:05:14.380> so<00:05:15.380> articulation<00:05:16.070> on<00:05:16.160> the

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:16.280 
as is the Hulk so articulation on the

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:17.710 
as is the Hulk so articulation on the
figure<00:05:16.550> is<00:05:16.610> pretty<00:05:16.820> good<00:05:17.000> the<00:05:17.210> head<00:05:17.360> is<00:05:17.540> just

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:17.720 
figure is pretty good the head is just

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:19.480 
figure is pretty good the head is just
on<00:05:17.930> a<00:05:17.960> standard<00:05:18.410> ball<00:05:18.590> joint<00:05:18.950> so<00:05:19.130> he<00:05:19.220> can<00:05:19.340> look

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:19.490 
on a standard ball joint so he can look

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:21.160 
on a standard ball joint so he can look
left<00:05:19.760> and<00:05:19.940> right<00:05:20.030> really<00:05:20.540> doesn't<00:05:20.870> have<00:05:20.990> any

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:21.170 
left and right really doesn't have any

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:23.230 
left and right really doesn't have any
up<00:05:21.380> or<00:05:21.530> down<00:05:21.680> movement<00:05:22.280> would<00:05:22.790> have<00:05:22.850> been<00:05:23.060> nice

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:23.240 
up or down movement would have been nice

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:24.700 
up or down movement would have been nice
if<00:05:23.270> they'd<00:05:23.570> given<00:05:23.810> him<00:05:23.900> a<00:05:24.050> hinge<00:05:24.290> at<00:05:24.440> the<00:05:24.530> neck

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:24.710 
if they'd given him a hinge at the neck

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:26.020 
if they'd given him a hinge at the neck
for<00:05:24.950> some<00:05:25.130> better<00:05:25.250> up<00:05:25.520> and<00:05:25.700> down<00:05:25.820> movement

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:26.030 
for some better up and down movement

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:36.400 
okay so that's my view overall I like
the<00:06:34.970> figure<00:06:35.390> I<00:06:35.419> think<00:06:35.690> it<00:06:35.780> looks<00:06:35.990> pretty<00:06:36.230> good

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:36.410 
the figure I think it looks pretty good

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:38.320 
the figure I think it looks pretty good
I<00:06:36.470> like<00:06:36.590> the<00:06:36.890> detailing<00:06:37.280> with<00:06:37.520> the<00:06:37.640> sculpt<00:06:38.120> I

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:38.330 
I like the detailing with the sculpt I

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:40.030 
I like the detailing with the sculpt I
do<00:06:38.600> think<00:06:38.930> it<00:06:39.020> would<00:06:39.110> have<00:06:39.230> been<00:06:39.260> nice<00:06:39.530> if<00:06:39.560> they

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:40.040 
do think it would have been nice if they

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:42.130 
do think it would have been nice if they
included<00:06:40.520> something<00:06:40.940> like<00:06:41.120> the<00:06:41.270> jacket<00:06:41.870> or

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:42.140 
included something like the jacket or

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:44.560 
included something like the jacket or
the<00:06:42.530> multiple<00:06:43.370> arrows<00:06:43.880> just<00:06:44.240> to<00:06:44.330> kind<00:06:44.510> of

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:44.570 
the multiple arrows just to kind of

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:46.390 
the multiple arrows just to kind of
differentiate<00:06:45.020> it<00:06:45.500> a<00:06:45.680> little<00:06:45.860> bit<00:06:46.070> from<00:06:46.190> that

00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:46.400 
differentiate it a little bit from that

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:47.920 
differentiate it a little bit from that
first<00:06:46.610> talk<00:06:46.850> I<00:06:47.030> figure<00:06:47.420> for<00:06:47.600> those<00:06:47.780> that

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:47.930 
first talk I figure for those that

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:50.020 
first talk I figure for those that
already<00:06:47.990> have<00:06:48.260> that<00:06:48.590> figure<00:06:48.950> but<00:06:49.610> otherwise<00:06:49.880> I

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:50.030 
already have that figure but otherwise I

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:51.610 
already have that figure but otherwise I
think<00:06:50.270> it's<00:06:50.540> nice<00:06:50.720> and<00:06:50.960> especially<00:06:51.170> for<00:06:51.470> those

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:51.620 
think it's nice and especially for those

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:53.200 
think it's nice and especially for those
like<00:06:51.860> myself<00:06:52.040> we<00:06:52.430> don't<00:06:52.460> have<00:06:52.850> that<00:06:53.030> first

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:53.210 
like myself we don't have that first

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:55.000 
like myself we don't have that first
talk<00:06:53.450> I<00:06:53.630> figure<00:06:53.960> I<00:06:53.990> think<00:06:54.500> this<00:06:54.650> is<00:06:54.830> definitely

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:55.010 
talk I figure I think this is definitely

00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:57.130 
talk I figure I think this is definitely
a<00:06:55.310> nice<00:06:55.490> addition<00:06:56.060> to<00:06:56.090> the<00:06:56.300> collection<00:06:56.810> it

00:06:57.130 --> 00:06:57.140 
a nice addition to the collection it

00:06:57.140 --> 00:06:58.870 
a nice addition to the collection it
fits<00:06:57.410> in<00:06:57.590> well<00:06:57.740> with<00:06:57.800> the<00:06:58.100> other<00:06:58.220> Avengers<00:06:58.550> age

00:06:58.870 --> 00:06:58.880 
fits in well with the other Avengers age

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:01.180 
fits in well with the other Avengers age
of<00:06:59.030> Ultron<00:06:59.150> figures<00:06:59.810> and<00:07:00.140> I<00:07:00.800> think<00:07:00.980> it<00:07:01.040> looks

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:01.190 
of Ultron figures and I think it looks

00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:02.800 
of Ultron figures and I think it looks
pretty<00:07:01.340> true<00:07:01.700> to<00:07:01.850> what<00:07:02.000> we<00:07:02.120> see<00:07:02.300> in<00:07:02.390> the<00:07:02.510> movie

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:02.810 
pretty true to what we see in the movie

00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:04.300 
pretty true to what we see in the movie
the<00:07:03.200> eyes<00:07:03.320> are<00:07:03.560> a<00:07:03.590> little<00:07:03.650> off<00:07:03.980> with<00:07:04.190> them

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:04.310 
the eyes are a little off with them

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:06.100 
the eyes are a little off with them
looking<00:07:04.550> off<00:07:04.730> to<00:07:04.760> the<00:07:04.910> side<00:07:05.000> but<00:07:05.570> otherwise<00:07:05.960> I

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:06.110 
looking off to the side but otherwise I

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:09.070 
looking off to the side but otherwise I
think<00:07:06.530> the<00:07:06.620> figure<00:07:06.890> looks<00:07:07.130> good<00:07:07.400> so<00:07:08.150> the<00:07:08.660> set

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:09.080 
think the figure looks good so the set

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:11.230 
think the figure looks good so the set
is<00:07:09.290> going<00:07:10.010> to<00:07:10.100> be<00:07:10.190> available<00:07:10.400> early<00:07:10.880> next
