can't really see what's below you and I

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.090 
can't really see what's below you and I
just<00:01:39.640> kind<00:01:39.820> of<00:01:39.850> launched<00:01:40.090> off<00:01:40.390> into<00:01:40.950> know<00:01:41.950> what

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:42.100 
just kind of launched off into know what

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.029 
just kind of launched off into know what
looks<00:01:42.250> like<00:01:42.340> flat<00:01:42.729> down<00:01:42.970> below<00:01:43.330> and<00:01:44.009> yeah<00:01:45.009> I

00:01:45.029 --> 00:01:45.039 
looks like flat down below and yeah I

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:46.320 
looks like flat down below and yeah I
don't<00:01:45.220> really<00:01:45.340> know<00:01:45.490> what<00:01:45.610> to<00:01:45.729> expect<00:01:45.759> it's

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:46.330 
don't really know what to expect it's

00:01:46.330 --> 00:02:01.130 
don't really know what to expect it's
mostly<00:01:46.569> drop<00:01:46.869> time<00:01:47.080> rather<00:01:47.319> than<00:01:47.470> up<00:01:47.799> and<00:01:47.979> out

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140
