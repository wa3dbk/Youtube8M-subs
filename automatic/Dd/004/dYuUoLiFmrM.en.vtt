00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
predict the you know this will kind of

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:14.749 
predict the you know this will kind of
alter<00:00:13.889> the<00:00:13.980> course<00:00:14.160> of<00:00:14.250> the<00:00:14.340> company<00:00:14.639> when

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
alter the course of the company when

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:16.310 
alter the course of the company when
Vince<00:00:14.969> I<00:00:15.150> guess<00:00:15.330> what<00:00:16.020> I<00:00:16.049> guess<00:00:16.230> ultimately

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
Vince I guess what I guess ultimately

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.250 
Vince I guess what I guess ultimately
steps<00:00:16.830> down<00:00:17.070> I<00:00:17.250> think<00:00:17.490> triple<00:00:18.029> H<00:00:18.119> is<00:00:18.260> basically

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
steps down I think triple H is basically

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.380 
steps down I think triple H is basically
setting<00:00:19.650> under<00:00:19.800> Vince's<00:00:20.250> learning<00:00:20.640> tree<00:00:20.910> and

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
setting under Vince's learning tree and

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.080 
setting under Vince's learning tree and
trying<00:00:22.289> to<00:00:22.410> learn<00:00:22.590> as<00:00:22.859> many<00:00:23.039> things<00:00:23.460> as<00:00:23.670> he<00:00:23.820> can

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
trying to learn as many things as he can

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.040 
trying to learn as many things as he can
about<00:00:24.320> every<00:00:25.320> aspect<00:00:25.500> of<00:00:26.099> the<00:00:26.220> business<00:00:27.050> and

about every aspect of the business and
there's<00:00:28.199> no<00:00:28.349> doubt<00:00:28.590> that<00:00:28.619> triple<00:00:29.160> Eight's

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
there's no doubt that triple Eight's

a Performance Center and the new talents

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.180 
a Performance Center and the new talents
that<00:00:42.180> are<00:00:42.300> coming<00:00:42.600> on<00:00:42.780> on<00:00:43.350> board<00:00:43.590> at<00:00:43.829> the<00:00:43.860> main

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
that are coming on on board at the main

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.819 
that are coming on on board at the main
roster<00:00:44.420> the<00:00:45.420> results<00:00:45.930> of<00:00:46.079> that<00:00:46.110> effort<00:00:46.680> is

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
roster the results of that effort is

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.130 
roster the results of that effort is
already<00:00:47.250> visible<00:00:47.700> it<00:00:48.210> will<00:00:48.450> continue<00:00:48.870> to<00:00:48.989> get

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
already visible it will continue to get

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.279 
already visible it will continue to get
better<00:00:50.180> and<00:00:51.180> then<00:00:51.329> I<00:00:51.360> think<00:00:51.719> that<00:00:51.899> it's<00:00:52.050> just<00:00:52.199> a

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
better and then I think that it's just a

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.790 
better and then I think that it's just a
matter<00:00:52.500> of<00:00:52.699> learning<00:00:53.699> the<00:00:54.329> other<00:00:54.930> aspects<00:00:55.649> of

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
matter of learning the other aspects of

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.860 
matter of learning the other aspects of
the<00:00:55.920> business<00:00:56.250> and<00:00:57.180> that's<00:00:57.329> that<00:00:57.719> is<00:00:57.840> a

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
the business and that's that is a

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.069 
the business and that's that is a
process<00:00:58.469> but<00:00:59.399> Triple<00:01:00.180> H<00:01:00.329> could<00:01:00.719> have<00:01:00.899> no

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
process but Triple H could have no

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:01.700 
process but Triple H could have no
better<00:01:01.289> teacher

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
better teacher

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.579
