I'm<00:00:16.260> often<00:00:16.500> accused<00:00:16.800> by<00:00:17.310> critical<00:00:17.760> opinion<00:00:18.240> of

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
I'm often accused by critical opinion of

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.900 
I'm often accused by critical opinion of
video<00:00:18.630> in<00:00:18.810> dust<00:00:19.080> borne<00:00:19.350> activity<00:00:19.950> instead<00:00:20.550> of

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
video in dust borne activity instead of

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.380 
video in dust borne activity instead of
genuine<00:00:21.420> spirituals<00:00:22.369> whilst<00:00:23.369> I<00:00:23.580> can<00:00:23.820> disagree

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
genuine spirituals whilst I can disagree

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.720 
genuine spirituals whilst I can disagree
with<00:00:24.570> these<00:00:24.689> opinions<00:00:25.260> I<00:00:25.500> can<00:00:26.099> agree<00:00:26.430> to<00:00:26.460> the

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
with these opinions I can agree to the

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.609 
with these opinions I can agree to the
fact<00:00:26.939> that<00:00:27.150> there<00:00:27.360> are<00:00:27.510> literally<00:00:28.050> millions

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
fact that there are literally millions

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.859 
fact that there are literally millions
and<00:00:29.130> millions<00:00:29.550> of<00:00:29.700> dust<00:00:29.939> particulates<00:00:30.330> in<00:00:30.840> the

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
and millions of dust particulates in the

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.290 
and millions of dust particulates in the
atmosphere<00:00:30.960> and<00:00:31.680> especially<00:00:32.489> in<00:00:32.879> a<00:00:33.000> normal

atmosphere and especially in a normal

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.869 
atmosphere and especially in a normal
domestic<00:00:33.570> room<00:00:34.050> this<00:00:34.680> is<00:00:34.890> amply<00:00:35.280> demonstrated

00:00:35.869 --> 00:00:35.879 
domestic room this is amply demonstrated

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:38.510 
domestic room this is amply demonstrated
by<00:00:36.330> simply<00:00:36.780> shining<00:00:37.260> a<00:00:37.350> flashlight<00:00:37.379> at<00:00:38.160> night

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
by simply shining a flashlight at night

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.610 
by simply shining a flashlight at night
and<00:00:38.879> into<00:00:39.300> the<00:00:39.420> air<00:00:39.570> and<00:00:39.900> in<00:00:40.080> the<00:00:40.110> light<00:00:40.350> beam

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
and into the air and in the light beam

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.439 
and into the air and in the light beam
you<00:00:40.860> will<00:00:40.890> see<00:00:41.250> tiny<00:00:41.670> specks<00:00:42.059> of<00:00:42.210> dust

00:00:42.439 --> 00:00:42.449 
you will see tiny specks of dust

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:45.350 
you will see tiny specks of dust
drifting<00:00:43.290> aimlessly<00:00:43.910> naturally<00:00:44.910> if<00:00:45.000> this<00:00:45.180> was

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
drifting aimlessly naturally if this was

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:45.950 
drifting aimlessly naturally if this was
true

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
true

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.540 
true
I<00:00:45.989> should<00:00:46.379> be<00:00:46.500> capturing<00:00:47.100> these<00:00:47.309> on

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
I should be capturing these on

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.000 
I should be capturing these on
camcorders<00:00:48.239> all<00:00:48.420> of<00:00:48.659> the<00:00:48.750> time<00:00:49.050> and<00:00:49.320> yet<00:00:49.800> from

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
camcorders all of the time and yet from

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.040 
camcorders all of the time and yet from
this<00:00:50.220> video<00:00:50.550> example<00:00:51.210> you<00:00:51.600> can<00:00:51.780> see<00:00:52.019> that

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
this video example you can see that

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.000 
this video example you can see that
there<00:00:52.379> is<00:00:52.470> no<00:00:52.680> ambient<00:00:53.190> activity<00:00:53.850> whatsoever

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.010 
there is no ambient activity whatsoever

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.070 
there is no ambient activity whatsoever
so<00:00:56.010> if<00:00:56.250> normal<00:00:56.699> airborne<00:00:57.210> dust<00:00:57.479> is<00:00:57.780> not<00:00:57.930> the

00:00:58.070 --> 00:00:58.080 
so if normal airborne dust is not the

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:02.090 
so if normal airborne dust is not the
culprit<00:00:58.320> what<00:00:58.920> is<00:01:00.379> well<00:01:01.379> to<00:01:01.589> answer<00:01:01.739> these

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
culprit what is well to answer these

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.430 
culprit what is well to answer these
points<00:01:02.610> I<00:01:02.760> need<00:01:02.790> to<00:01:03.059> address<00:01:03.299> the<00:01:03.750> causations

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:04.440 
points I need to address the causations

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:06.430 
points I need to address the causations
and<00:01:04.710> likelihood<00:01:05.190> of<00:01:05.220> dust<00:01:05.549> being<00:01:05.790> responsible

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:06.440 
and likelihood of dust being responsible

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.350 
and likelihood of dust being responsible
the<00:01:07.440> most<00:01:07.680> common<00:01:08.040> example<00:01:08.610> is<00:01:08.820> caused<00:01:09.119> by

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
the most common example is caused by

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.750 
the most common example is caused by
human<00:01:09.750> feet<00:01:10.020> or<00:01:10.380> indeed<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.250> human<00:01:11.549> body

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760

likely<00:01:13.979> to<00:01:14.130> generate<00:01:14.310> dust<00:01:15.440> common<00:01:16.440> examples

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979

dust particulates are much heavier than
the<00:01:27.119> normal<00:01:27.390> airborne<00:01:27.840> examples<00:01:28.469> and<00:01:28.710> from

regards to the or phenomenon is that

00:04:56.889 --> 00:05:00.509 
regards to the or phenomenon is that
they<00:04:57.519> aren't<00:04:57.789> always<00:04:58.119> wok<00:04:58.539> shaped<00:04:59.189> these<00:05:00.189> four
