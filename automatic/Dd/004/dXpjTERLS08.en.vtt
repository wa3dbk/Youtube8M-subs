greater image file sizes and when they
bring<00:00:38.850> it<00:00:38.969> to<00:00:39.059> the<00:00:39.149> computer<00:00:39.570> it<00:00:39.750> just<00:00:39.989> takes<00:00:40.110> a

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
bring it to the computer it just takes a

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.830 
bring it to the computer it just takes a
lot<00:00:40.320> of<00:00:40.350> hard<00:00:40.590> drive<00:00:40.800> space<00:00:40.829> so<00:00:41.250> this<00:00:42.149> tutorial

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
lot of hard drive space so this tutorial

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.479 
lot of hard drive space so this tutorial
shows<00:00:42.899> how<00:00:43.020> to<00:00:43.170> resize<00:00:43.620> them<00:00:43.829> all<00:00:44.070> at<00:00:44.280> once

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
shows how to resize them all at once

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.490 
shows how to resize them all at once

really really big pain in the ass what
you<00:00:48.960> have<00:00:49.079> to<00:00:49.140> do<00:00:49.230> you<00:00:49.320> have<00:00:49.440> to<00:00:49.530> download<00:00:49.710> the

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
you have to do you have to download the

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.240 
you have to do you have to download the
program<00:00:50.160> called<00:00:50.899> it's<00:00:51.899> called<00:00:52.170> downsize<00:00:53.039> and

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
program called it's called downsize and

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.799 
program called it's called downsize and
I'm<00:00:53.340> going<00:00:53.460> to<00:00:53.550> launch<00:00:53.699> it<00:00:53.910> right<00:00:53.940> now<00:00:55.250> down

00:00:56.799 --> 00:00:56.809 
I'm going to launch it right now down

00:00:56.809 --> 00:00:59.720 
I'm going to launch it right now down
there<00:00:57.809> we<00:00:57.960> go<00:00:58.140> and<00:00:58.469> this<00:00:59.219> is<00:00:59.340> what<00:00:59.520> it<00:00:59.550> looks

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
there we go and this is what it looks

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:00.680 
there we go and this is what it looks
like<00:00:59.820> is<00:00:59.969> there<00:01:00.120> a<00:01:00.149> very<00:01:00.329> very<00:01:00.570> small

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
like is there a very very small

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.479 
like is there a very very small
lightweight<00:01:01.230> application<00:01:01.890> and<00:01:02.100> all<00:01:02.190> it<00:01:02.340> does

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
lightweight application and all it does

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.020 
lightweight application and all it does
is<00:01:02.699> allows<00:01:03.359> you<00:01:03.539> to<00:01:03.690> customize<00:01:04.820> pictures<00:01:05.820> so

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
is allows you to customize pictures so

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.910 
is allows you to customize pictures so
let's<00:01:06.330> go<00:01:06.479> ahead<00:01:06.510> and<00:01:06.689> select<00:01:07.170> another<00:01:07.530> source

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
let's go ahead and select another source

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.250 
let's go ahead and select another source
to<00:01:08.549> import<00:01:08.939> pictures<00:01:09.119> on<00:01:09.360> this<00:01:09.450> is<00:01:09.630> I<00:01:09.840> family

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
to import pictures on this is I family

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.240 
to import pictures on this is I family
folder<00:01:10.799> and<00:01:12.140> with<00:01:13.140> a<00:01:13.350> lot<00:01:13.500> of<00:01:13.530> image<00:01:13.799> inside<00:01:14.100> of

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
folder and with a lot of image inside of

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.340 
folder and with a lot of image inside of
it<00:01:14.369> so<00:01:14.490> I'm<00:01:14.580> just<00:01:14.670> going<00:01:14.790> to<00:01:14.970> select<00:01:15.270> and<00:01:15.750> it

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
it so I'm just going to select and it

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:17.810 
it so I'm just going to select and it
imports<00:01:16.830> them<00:01:16.979> and<00:01:17.189> it<00:01:17.369> automatically

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
imports them and it automatically

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.370 
imports them and it automatically
recognizes<00:01:18.299> how<00:01:18.509> many<00:01:18.659> pictures<00:01:18.869> there<00:01:19.110> there

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
recognizes how many pictures there there

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.350 
recognizes how many pictures there there
are<00:01:19.409> so<00:01:20.130> in<00:01:20.340> this<00:01:20.430> case<00:01:20.580> there<00:01:20.759> are<00:01:20.880> 305

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
are so in this case there are 305

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.420 
are so in this case there are 305
pictures<00:01:21.720> and<00:01:21.930> there<00:01:22.170> now<00:01:22.799> here's<00:01:23.159> where<00:01:23.369> you

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
pictures and there now here's where you

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.609 
pictures and there now here's where you
can<00:01:23.580> set<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:24.479> rules<00:01:24.750> or<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:25.229> resizing

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
can set the rules or the resizing

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.499 
can set the rules or the resizing
properties<00:01:26.460> when<00:01:26.729> you<00:01:26.820> want<00:01:27.000> to<00:01:27.090> resize<00:01:27.360> these

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
properties when you want to resize these

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.840 
properties when you want to resize these
pictures<00:01:27.840> so<00:01:28.380> max<00:01:28.680> worth<00:01:28.950> its<00:01:29.130> 500<00:01:29.460> pixels<00:01:29.670> and

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
pictures so max worth its 500 pixels and

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.550 
pictures so max worth its 500 pixels and
max<00:01:30.000> Titus<00:01:30.270> 500<00:01:30.600> pixels<00:01:30.780> or<00:01:30.960> do<00:01:31.320> you<00:01:31.380> want<00:01:31.500> to

max Titus 500 pixels or do you want to

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.170 
max Titus 500 pixels or do you want to
change<00:01:31.710> it<00:01:31.799> to<00:01:31.920> something<00:01:32.070> like<00:01:32.340> seven<00:01:33.119> or
