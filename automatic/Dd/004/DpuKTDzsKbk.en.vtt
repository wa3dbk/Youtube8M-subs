00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:06.330
 I want to make sweet sake with a yogurt maker called Yogurtia 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:12.419
 The good thing is 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:16.320
 Temperature control can be firmly done . I used to have sweet sake made with this thermos bottle before 

00:00:12.419 --> 00:00:20.050
 But this is temperature, but temperature control can not be done 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:23.769
 So, in that sense, this Yogurtian is really 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:27.490
 Is that how to make this sweet sake once ? 

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:33.250
 I will do my best today The first thing to prepare is a bowl and water 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:39.350
 Yes First, as in the manual button Masu one Tsudeki put this 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:45.710
 We will sterilize in children with nature such as rice . 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:50.030
 And I'll put in water I'm going to water I'm going to be the amount of water at this time 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:52.449
 Was it likely Masu regularly to the 2 and the cap to the next 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.449
 How 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:01:01.400
 It is put in 4 yogurt makers-it is great easy here 

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:05.360
 First the temperature like this 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:08.050
 Continue to 60 degrees and press the timer button 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.290
 In the form of 8 hours raised 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:12.830
 start 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:16.370
 And just wait 8 hours in this condition and you're done 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:17.860
 Yes 8 hours later Let's open the lid 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:21.370
 in this way 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:22.220
 Sweet sake is really professional 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:26.210
 Huh 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:31.340
 A bacillus is a temperature change in the first place 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:38.920
 The temperature of that high is not good even in comparison to is useless even if I cat Yogurutia is 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:45.340
 This product temperature quality exercise 60 soul is very useful though it seems 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:51.250
 It's very sweet with the Amami and sweetness of that gem and this difference in light smell 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:57.399
