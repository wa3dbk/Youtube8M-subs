00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.029
 hello youtube people since the pri 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:08.370
 cowboy and go - a new video of the grand 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:10.170
 theft auto 5 of playstation3 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.929
 I wanted to tell you that I already reach 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.120
 100% of this game complete all the 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.650
 campaign missions plus all the 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.779
 additional things that need to be done to 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.130
 get one hundred percent there 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.410
 many things to do for example 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.570
 fulfill the missions of strangers and fools 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.609
 a total of 20 important missions 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.590
 because there are going to be many more missions 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.140
 strange and crazy but you just have to 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.090
 complete 20 of which you can see 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.309
 which are with the guide that I am going to 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.129
 leave in the description of this video is 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:40.920
 an ign.com guide I really thought 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:43.290
 very useful when it comes to getting this 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.329
 100% and within other things that you have to 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.160
 do of course you have to take out the 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.890
 other trophies such as getting 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.440
 collectibles get 50 part 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.940
 of the space ships get 50 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.430
 letters of the murder of the lion now 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:59.190
 johnson complete the flights below 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.600
 of the bridge and flights to knives and 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.260
 also of course as we are seeing 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:06.150
 at this time complete 25 of the 50 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.570
 acrobatic jumps 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:11.250
 to get 100% 100% what 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.870
 represents finishing the game completely 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.330
 because there are many things to do 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:17.370
 apart from this for example there are others 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.160
 independent trophies to this as per 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:22.800
 example spend 200 million dollars 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:25.560
 between the three characters and also 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:27.720
 complete 70 million in gold between 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.000
 campaign missions and missions 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.860
 weird and crazy people really considering 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.380
 which is a long game is not easy 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.910
 get it there are many things to do and 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.980
 really for having completed it in 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:40.290
 nine days equally as I said there is 

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:41.610
 many things to do still complete 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.410
 the nine days for me is a whole 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.240
