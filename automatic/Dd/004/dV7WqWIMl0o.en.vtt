you

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:04.390 

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:06.849 

here<00:00:05.390> we<00:00:05.479> have<00:00:05.600> a<00:00:05.629> wave<00:00:05.870> of<00:00:06.170> a<00:00:06.319> certain

00:00:06.849 --> 00:00:06.859 
here we have a wave of a certain

00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:09.400 
here we have a wave of a certain
amplitude<00:00:07.099> I<00:00:07.580> only<00:00:07.700> call<00:00:08.000> a<00:00:08.209> and<00:00:08.540> if<00:00:09.290> we

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:09.410 
amplitude I only call a and if we

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:11.440 
amplitude I only call a and if we
consider<00:00:09.830> a<00:00:10.100> very<00:00:10.519> similar<00:00:10.820> wave<00:00:11.090> that<00:00:11.330> has

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:11.450 
consider a very similar wave that has

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:13.030 
consider a very similar wave that has
the<00:00:11.570> same<00:00:11.750> wave<00:00:12.019> length<00:00:12.049> but<00:00:12.589> it<00:00:12.679> may<00:00:12.799> be<00:00:12.860> a

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:13.040 
the same wave length but it may be a

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.030 
the same wave length but it may be a
different<00:00:13.519> amplitude<00:00:14.320> so<00:00:15.320> maybe<00:00:15.500> half<00:00:15.830> the

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:16.040 
different amplitude so maybe half the

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:18.999 
different amplitude so maybe half the
amplitude<00:00:17.259> and<00:00:18.259> this<00:00:18.380> is<00:00:18.500> quite<00:00:18.680> a<00:00:18.710> tricky

00:00:18.999 --> 00:00:19.009 
amplitude and this is quite a tricky

00:00:19.009 --> 00:00:20.410 
amplitude and this is quite a tricky
thing<00:00:19.040> to<00:00:19.189> draw<00:00:19.430> doing<00:00:19.700> a<00:00:19.759> sine<00:00:19.939> wave<00:00:20.150> but<00:00:20.269> it's

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:20.420 
thing to draw doing a sine wave but it's

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:23.230 
thing to draw doing a sine wave but it's
worth<00:00:20.570> practicing<00:00:21.100> that's<00:00:22.100> not<00:00:22.310> bad<00:00:22.460> is<00:00:22.609> it<00:00:22.760> if

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:23.240 
worth practicing that's not bad is it if

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.950 
worth practicing that's not bad is it if
this<00:00:23.510> other<00:00:23.750> wave<00:00:24.050> has<00:00:24.529> an<00:00:24.710> amplitude<00:00:25.039> of<00:00:25.960> 1/2

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:26.960 
this other wave has an amplitude of 1/2

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.859 
this other wave has an amplitude of 1/2
of<00:00:27.289> the<00:00:27.560> other<00:00:27.679> one<00:00:27.890> we<00:00:28.699> can<00:00:28.939> look<00:00:28.970> at<00:00:29.330> the

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:29.869 
of the other one we can look at the

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:31.599 
of the other one we can look at the
difference<00:00:30.259> in<00:00:30.380> the<00:00:30.470> intensity<00:00:31.130> or<00:00:31.160> the<00:00:31.310> power

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:31.609 
difference in the intensity or the power

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:35.320 
difference in the intensity or the power
of<00:00:31.730> these<00:00:32.000> two<00:00:32.239> waves<00:00:32.559> now<00:00:33.559> the<00:00:34.309> intensity<00:00:35.000> of

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:35.330 
of these two waves now the intensity of

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:40.510 
of these two waves now the intensity of
an<00:00:35.480> object<00:00:38.050> is<00:00:39.050> a<00:00:39.110> measure<00:00:39.860> of<00:00:39.980> the<00:00:40.129> amount<00:00:40.219> of

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:40.520 
an object is a measure of the amount of

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.020 
an object is a measure of the amount of
energy<00:00:40.730> per<00:00:41.149> second<00:00:41.750> per<00:00:42.129> square<00:00:43.129> meter<00:00:43.370> so

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:44.030 
energy per second per square meter so

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.830 
energy per second per square meter so
the<00:00:44.149> intensity<00:00:44.420> is<00:00:45.170> equal<00:00:45.590> to<00:00:45.680> power<00:00:45.950> over<00:00:46.840> the

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:47.840 
the intensity is equal to power over the

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.310 
the intensity is equal to power over the
cross-sectional<00:00:48.559> area<00:00:49.930> if<00:00:50.930> we<00:00:51.050> think<00:00:51.170> about

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:51.320 
cross-sectional area if we think about

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.619 
cross-sectional area if we think about
intensity<00:00:51.949> I<00:00:52.219> maybe<00:00:52.640> have<00:00:52.969> the<00:00:53.149> light<00:00:53.360> on<00:00:53.539> the

00:00:53.619 --> 00:00:53.629 
intensity I maybe have the light on the

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:56.950 
intensity I maybe have the light on the
flame<00:00:53.840> now<00:00:54.379> if<00:00:54.559> I<00:00:54.710> shine<00:00:54.980> it<00:00:55.190> at<00:00:55.760> 1<00:00:56.149> if<00:00:56.539> I<00:00:56.750> put

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:56.960 
flame now if I shine it at 1 if I put

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:58.689 
flame now if I shine it at 1 if I put
all<00:00:56.989> of<00:00:57.109> that<00:00:57.289> energy<00:00:57.559> onto<00:00:58.100> one<00:00:58.250> small<00:00:58.520> area

00:00:58.689 --> 00:00:58.699 
all of that energy onto one small area

00:00:58.699 --> 00:00:59.979 
all of that energy onto one small area
is<00:00:58.879> going<00:00:58.969> to<00:00:59.059> be<00:00:59.120> quite<00:00:59.239> intense<00:00:59.629> brightness

00:00:59.979 --> 00:00:59.989 
is going to be quite intense brightness

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:03.700 
is going to be quite intense brightness
as<00:01:00.379> I<00:01:01.250> as<00:01:02.030> that<00:01:02.329> energy<00:01:03.079> is<00:01:03.170> spread<00:01:03.289> out<00:01:03.379> over<00:01:03.500> a

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:03.710 
as I as that energy is spread out over a

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.279 
as I as that energy is spread out over a
larger<00:01:04.129> and<00:01:04.280> larger<00:01:04.399> area<00:01:04.970> we<00:01:05.810> can<00:01:05.930> say<00:01:06.110> that

00:01:06.279 --> 00:01:06.289 
larger and larger area we can say that

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:07.840 
larger and larger area we can say that
the<00:01:06.380> intensity<00:01:06.770> of<00:01:06.890> the<00:01:06.979> light<00:01:07.100> is<00:01:07.610> going<00:01:07.759> to

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:07.850 
the intensity of the light is going to

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:09.999 
the intensity of the light is going to
be<00:01:07.940> less<00:01:08.360> and<00:01:08.509> less<00:01:08.660> so<00:01:09.229> the<00:01:09.349> intensity<00:01:09.619> equals

00:01:09.999 --> 00:01:10.009 
be less and less so the intensity equals

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:11.770 
be less and less so the intensity equals
power<00:01:10.220> in<00:01:10.459> that<00:01:10.580> area<00:01:10.849> and<00:01:11.060> actually<00:01:11.569> what<00:01:11.690> we

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:11.780 
power in that area and actually what we

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:13.510 
power in that area and actually what we
find<00:01:12.050> is<00:01:12.319> that<00:01:12.380> your<00:01:12.619> intensity<00:01:13.039> isn't

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520 
find is that your intensity isn't

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.150 
find is that your intensity isn't
proportional<00:01:14.090> just<00:01:14.420> to<00:01:14.539> the<00:01:14.630> amplitude<00:01:15.160> we

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:16.160 
proportional just to the amplitude we

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:17.859 
proportional just to the amplitude we
can<00:01:16.340> look<00:01:16.459> at<00:01:16.580> maybe<00:01:16.759> the<00:01:16.910> difference<00:01:17.270> in<00:01:17.509> the

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:17.869 
can look at maybe the difference in the

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:21.219 
can look at maybe the difference in the
area<00:01:18.349> under<00:01:19.160> the<00:01:19.250> wave<00:01:19.399> here<00:01:19.729> for<00:01:20.690> the<00:01:20.750> small<00:01:20.959> 3

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:21.229 
area under the wave here for the small 3

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:24.580 
area under the wave here for the small 3
1<00:01:21.410> and<00:01:21.860> if<00:01:22.130> we<00:01:22.160> compare<00:01:22.640> that<00:01:22.759> area<00:01:23.470> to<00:01:24.470> the

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:24.590 
1 and if we compare that area to the

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:30.790 
1 and if we compare that area to the
whole<00:01:24.770> thing<00:01:28.899> the<00:01:29.899> area<00:01:30.259> of<00:01:30.349> the<00:01:30.440> blue<00:01:30.590> one<00:01:30.770> is

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:30.800 
whole thing the area of the blue one is

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.010 
whole thing the area of the blue one is
about<00:01:31.069> a<00:01:31.099> quarter<00:01:31.550> of<00:01:31.670> that<00:01:31.700> what<00:01:32.599> this<00:01:32.780> shows

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
about a quarter of that what this shows

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.380 
about a quarter of that what this shows
is<00:01:33.289> by<00:01:33.470> looking<00:01:33.649> at<00:01:33.890> the<00:01:33.950> area<00:01:34.520> underneath<00:01:35.270> the

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.390 
is by looking at the area underneath the

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:37.510 
is by looking at the area underneath the
curve<00:01:35.539> for<00:01:35.989> the<00:01:36.050> amplitude<00:01:36.950> of<00:01:37.190> the<00:01:37.280> small

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
curve for the amplitude of the small

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:38.919 
curve for the amplitude of the small
blue<00:01:37.670> wave<00:01:37.819> that's<00:01:38.030> quite<00:01:38.239> small<00:01:38.539> compared<00:01:38.899> to

00:01:38.919 --> 00:01:38.929 
blue wave that's quite small compared to

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:41.559 
blue wave that's quite small compared to
the<00:01:39.050> very<00:01:39.259> large<00:01:39.410> area<00:01:39.950> for<00:01:40.940> the<00:01:41.090> higher

00:01:41.559 --> 00:01:41.569 
the very large area for the higher

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:43.630 
the very large area for the higher
amplitude<00:01:41.899> and<00:01:42.679> what<00:01:42.920> we<00:01:43.009> can<00:01:43.160> draw<00:01:43.310> from<00:01:43.459> this

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:43.640 
amplitude and what we can draw from this

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.330 
amplitude and what we can draw from this
is<00:01:43.849> that<00:01:43.910> the<00:01:44.090> intensity<00:01:44.599> is<00:01:44.989> proportional<00:01:45.739> to

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
is that the intensity is proportional to

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.100 
is that the intensity is proportional to
the<00:01:46.520> amplitude<00:01:46.729> squared<00:01:47.569> it's<00:01:47.780> not<00:01:47.899> just

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.110 
the amplitude squared it's not just

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:50.169 
the amplitude squared it's not just
proportional<00:01:48.440> to<00:01:48.739> the<00:01:48.800> height<00:01:48.950> a<00:01:49.250> wave<00:01:50.000> of

00:01:50.169 --> 00:01:50.179 
proportional to the height a wave of

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:52.389 
proportional to the height a wave of
double<00:01:50.479> amplitude<00:01:51.020> carries<00:01:51.649> four<00:01:51.950> times<00:01:52.220> as

00:01:52.389 --> 00:01:52.399 
double amplitude carries four times as

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:55.000 
double amplitude carries four times as
much<00:01:52.550> energy
