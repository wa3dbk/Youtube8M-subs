00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.290
 hello my friends how are you 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.299
 small animal I stand here and heartily 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.170
 Welcome to my goal pro 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:08.849
 from the 15th 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.730
 In this video I want to show you 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:14.099
 how to tell simple and effective 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.420
 what can you do more important tutorial 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.670
 you can now see on the 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.460
 look at the screen or the link in the 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.480
 video description will follow 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:23.609
 basically there are different ways 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.180
 the ball in the fifth gate under 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.859
 cancel 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.930
 I will tell you these now by means of 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.609
 explain and explain examples 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.219
 At first we have the normal one 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:34.079
 powerful full-power shot think with 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.540
 a simple press of the shot button 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.520
 look if you make a header 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.160
 this also works with this 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.350
 if he plays but finally a key 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.600
 header or a shot with the foot 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.760
 Power depends of course on the 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:51.149
 situation from then there is still the 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:54.000
 Treasury a shot with a lot of effet then 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:56.969
 can you from Vienna in the rb on the 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.609
 xbox or the once on the playstation 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.469
 were depressing street keep that 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.030
 There are other special types 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.519
 complete a call 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:08.310
 first the chip you can through the 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:11.280
 Keep the llb cup on the export resp 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.439
 the l1 key on the place i was on 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.180
 pressing shot button 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.580
 other special kind is the 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.799
 For example, through acrobatic goal 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.049
 a side-puller fallback 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:25.200
 A hard shot of a flying-ball 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:28.409
 or similar you have to choose the 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:31.740
 Lucky shot just lp on the 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:34.170
 xbox and s2 on the classic holder too 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.420
 good last could do the left stick to it 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.140
 need to change the direction of the shot 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.420
 determine 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.310
 this is very important because the handlebar 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.759
 stick should rather point in the direction 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.799
 was shot to go so that's it 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:49.079
 first of all the different types 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:51.119
 attacking the fifa 15 to finish 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:52.470
 I will give you tips and tricks 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:55.979
 based on different situations 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.570
 show in the first situation 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.850
 We are centrally in front of the gate 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:02.520
 here should always make sure with the 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:05.280
 strong foot of the player complete 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.049
 then it is important to have a shot in 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.629
 the right corner from the view of 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:12.120
 complete with a player 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:14.549
 left foot in the logically 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.290
 to complete campact at the conclusion 

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:19.470
 could a powerful Vollspannschuss 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:21.330
 but also a finis shot apply that 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.040
 hangs so far from the game and 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.230
 the distance to the gate 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.970
 at more than 20 meters, I would always 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:30.180
 a powerful full-power shot 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:33.200
 benefit but you are closer to the gate 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:35.129
 he finished off with a fitness 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.650
 Generally speaking , between one 

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:40.890
 shallow shot one and a half high shot and 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:42.000
 a high shot choose the execution 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.579
 It is really easy 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.650
 the longer the road is pressed the more 

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:48.959
 higher is the shot also that it 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:51.120
 individually dependent on players and 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:53.250
 can not be generalized though 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.500
 you get a feeling for a word 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:58.620
 I like you the training arena like mine 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.879
 Duties related to which I can pass 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:02.250
 tell you that the low shot 

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:05.370
 within the section is very effective 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:06.980
 because the goalkeeper has to come down first 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:10.409
 to keep the ball 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:12.959
 for larger distances is a 

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:14.400
 flat shot in the rule namely post 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:16.349
 l is hidden 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.299
 otherwise I will always be one 

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:20.790
 powerful and a placed shot 

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:22.500
 recommend a half-high shot 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:23.280
 generally always with a small risk 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.650
 connected 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.780
 which is very easy to hold when 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:30.359
 Goalkeeper is good the next situation 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:32.639
 looks like we are running sideways on the 

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:36.040
 Thor in my eyes the perfect 

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:38.590
 situation to score a goal 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:41.200
 I let him into the long corner 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:42.879
 It's called from the left side 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:46.120
 conclusion in the right corner 

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:48.310
 and logically if you sort of 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:49.659
 the right side comes to the left 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:51.909
 shoot down 

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:53.920
 very important is before the shot too 

00:03:51.909 --> 00:03:55.629
 try in the direction exactly after 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:57.909
 then align and forestry 

00:03:55.629 --> 00:04:00.010
 this increases the chances of success 

00:03:57.909 --> 00:04:02.170
 personally always use a powerful 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:04.269
 shot if you better with one 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:06.909
 fitness circuit cope can you 

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:08.470
 this of course also supplement associations 

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:10.420
 I should say that such a 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:12.879
 situation, of course, on the short 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:14.829
 can then complete the post 

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:17.829
 But committee be very clever 

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:19.180
 to the joy these were two typical 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:21.549
 situation in front of the gate 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:22.440
 It continues with the finesse related 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:25.300
 on a long shot 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:28.180
 here are two different spots of 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:32.440
 those from a fitness is very effective 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:33.639
 this places bags at the sixteenth corner 20 25 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:36.370
 meter in front of the gate 

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:39.400
 Here you see the ball in the long corner 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:41.560
 the approximately workrooms with a 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:43.810
 right shot in the right corner circle 

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:47.160
 and if he came from the right with one 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:49.110
 left foot to open the left corner 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:51.930
 This turns the ball around the goalkeeper 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:55.470
 pulled all the other position especially 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:57.170
 At larger distances, I would like him 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:58.380
 a powerful full-power shot 

00:04:57.170 --> 00:05:00.390
 to lock 

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:02.960
 if you see a long shot tutorial 

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:05.850
 Wanted to post in the comments 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:08.280
 we continue with the header here 

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:10.830
 It's also a simple but very effective one 

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:13.650
 trick on a flank comes from the left 

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:16.830
 head into the left corner of the ball as well 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:18.600
 tores comes a flank of world on the 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:21.090
 Ball also in the right corner 

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:22.920
 why the whole thing if the simple 

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:25.290
 ball against the direction of the goalkeeper 

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:27.900
 beheaded, he has problems chic 

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:30.480
 react because simply no ball has ans 

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:34.230
 by the head against the direction of travel 

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:37.440
 the gatekeeper owns the alpha the chance 

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:39.780
 trying to score a goal very hard 

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:42.120
 it is very effective 

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:44.730
 Of course, the whole works at 

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:46.500
 Corner balls as well now come to the 

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:48.660
 jewelery of his graduations if he 

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:51.060
 At first I would receive you first 

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:54.300
 only the aforementioned standard deals 

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:56.370
 to use if you have a chip over the 

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:58.650
 Goalkeeper out of word must be a thing 

00:05:56.370 --> 00:06:00.960
 his motorcycle is no longer allowed on the 

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:03.360
 line stand the power must be here yourself 

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:06.210
 find out because these are very much dependent 

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:08.100
 very different from each player off and on 

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:10.500
 all distance to the gate 

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:13.020
 when the door is running straight behind 

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:15.570
 offers a chip e mail at the 

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:17.280
 can not run back in time 

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:19.650
 Ship can pass even after a high pass 

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:21.630
 was like going to run 

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:24.540
 but less power is needed here 

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:26.760
 as a chip from the ground then there 

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:28.500
 it is still the case with the case 

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:30.750
 hard shot for more than special 

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:33.690
 This could be with the hold of the 

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:35.280
 lp took care of the xbox of l2 cup 

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:37.620
 the playstation warning shot process 

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:39.750
 If you are bored by boring 

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:41.580
 has enough conti times try one 

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:43.980
 to achieve fancy goal 

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:46.230
 for detailed information 

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:48.750

 The video description will be followed by such talent 

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:57.529
 something a little bit over with 

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:59.839
 but also to do with dribbling 

00:06:57.529 --> 00:07:01.789
 the one-on-one situation with 

00:06:59.839 --> 00:07:04.129
 enterprise level in the future one 

00:07:01.789 --> 00:07:07.249
 detailed tutorial follow but already 

00:07:04.129 --> 00:07:09.559
 times outplayed sport offers itself 

00:07:07.249 --> 00:07:11.959
 this example of his the climber 

00:07:09.559 --> 00:07:15.229
 just three meters in front of the goal 

00:07:11.959 --> 00:07:17.809
 play for the garmisch in the ideal case 

00:07:15.229 --> 00:07:20.089
 then stands before an empty gate and 

00:07:17.809 --> 00:07:23.149
 just a shot as I said 

00:07:20.089 --> 00:07:25.519
