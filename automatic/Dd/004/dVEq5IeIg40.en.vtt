00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:05.510
 hello everyone my name is Pablo and in our 

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:07.550
 new video I will teach you how to make a 

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:08.809
 new figure of the rubin twist 

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:10.850
 well I'll teach you to do 

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:12.890
 pistol number 2 that I like is 

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:16.309
 Sincerely more than the 1 is more 

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:19.070
 realistic and I do not know how I like it anymore you'll see 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:20.420
 as if you have a good twist ruby left 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:23.960
 very cool what happens is that this is a 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:25.250
 bit bad but good you'll see or 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.160
 if you do not have a repeat it's good too 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:29.930
 it's going to be nice to start 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.970
 let's do let's have our 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:34.079
 rugby twist in a line as I have it 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:37.350
 Me as always 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:41.030
 and let's start let's put ruiz like this 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.030
 with the tip looking up 

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:47.540
 sorry 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:49.040
 let's put it that way better then go to 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:52.300
 be easier 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:52.300
 then so 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:57.770
 The first thing we are going to do is double 

00:00:55.130 --> 00:01:00.200
 this corner twice like the 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:02.930
 number one gun here we will 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:06.230
 always do double movements too 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:08.360
 doubles ie 1 and 2 we always go 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:11.320
 we are always going to do double movements 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:14.850
 so it's going to be pretty easy 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:20.340
 well let's start we see this 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:20.340
 corner as I have 2 times 1 and 2 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:30.009
 then we count 1 2 and 3 triangles 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:32.790
 it's just like there's 1 2 and 3 there and 

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:36.340
 we put twice 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:39.400
 we cut twice here 1 and 2 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:41.900
 this has to be left now let's 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:45.860
 count 1 and 2 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:48.150
 and we are going to cut here twice 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:50.400
 new one 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:52.170
 and two so that we keep this to 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:56.220
 same as here 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:58.830
 now you have to cut here and two 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:00.230
 upwards because we count here 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:02.520
 as there is 

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:06.420
 and two up 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.979
 we count twice one and two and now 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.929
 we have to always follow a line 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.819
 straight so we have to cut by 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:14.909
 here we have 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:18.080
 so long and so now we have 1 2 

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:23.270
 and we cut through here twice 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:25.709
 1 and 2 so that we have this 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:28.590
 once you have once you have 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:32.489
 this is going to count three triangles 1 2 and 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:35.900
 3 and you're going to cut here is worth here 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:38.590
 twice again 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.590
 one 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:50.090
 and 2 should be this and now we are going to 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:53.000
 count 44 triangulitos 1 2 3 and 4 vale and 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:55.200
 we cut through here twice again 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.300
 here 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:03.480
 one 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:06.540
 and 2 it is almost left to count 1 2 3 and 4 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:09.270
 and there 3 because we have the same 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:12.810
 over here like there 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:15.270
 once and twice and already the only thing that we 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:18.370
 is is to follow this straight line as 

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:19.890
 well easy cutting twice 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:23.700
 a 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:26.910
 and two as you see we have our 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:30.290
 pistol number two is pretty cool and 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:30.290
 I like it better than the 1 because he said 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:35.380
 and good nothing I hope you liked 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:40.390
 the video 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:44.310
 and nothing will go up and the pistol number 3 does not 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:46.650
 I know when but soon 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:48.900
 and well I hope you liked it 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:50.330
 you say deixan like subscribe yes 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:54.160
 you want 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:54.160
 and nothing until soon
