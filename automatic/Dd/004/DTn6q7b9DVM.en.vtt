00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.859
 hi to all in this video we see 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:09.059
 how to install a modified recovery 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:13.650
 on the galaxy s3 then the procedure is 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:17.580
 very simple it takes two rows that is 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:21.810
 a program that edin is a file that 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:23.970
 this will leave you both links 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.310
 I recommend this indescrezioni 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:30.090
 very important must be a file 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:33.870
 point tar point md5 I recommend not 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:36.329
 wrong this thing then we have 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:39.809
 audine run like me tight 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:42.840
 administrator ok well the interface of 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.610
 today this is more or less the non-version 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:48.350
 nothing changes 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:52.079
 don't touch anything except the pda button 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:53.670
 and in this case we are asked to go 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.390
 to choose the file that I have 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.620
 said before 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.640
 so you're at this point md5 mi 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:05.000
 I recommend 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:08.130
 ok put it here as you see now 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.720
 this acronym indicates that the galaxy s iii 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.390
 connected and computer 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:15.299
 in the case in which it is not connected 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.740
 connect it don't worry if 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.560
 this acronym is different 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.509
 the important fact is that there is how 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.590
 subsequently we have to put in 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:27.150
 download mod 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:31.380
 the galaxy s iii as you do on the phone 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:33.000
 off input we hope then from 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:37.290
 phone off we have to press 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:41.659
 at the same time the home button key 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.659
 power and volume down 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:50.810
 then a moment very well then I think 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.810
 we try 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:00.820
 This is the perfect screen 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:03.189
 presents in front you have to click volume 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:05.679
 up to continue this is the screen 

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:08.229
 download mode just fine once 

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:13.989
 once this is done we are left with it 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:17.319
 other than clicking start network here is 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:23.790
 working red hat has already finished indeed 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:23.790
 the galaxy s iii is restarting 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.440
 proceeding should have gone to 

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:33.330
 successful 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:33.330
 however, we will check it out immediately 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:54.610
 on lit to check that a 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:58.750
 proceeding was successful 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:03:00.120
 since of new applications there is none 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:05.069
 I'm 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:12.760
 we simply need to restart the 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:14.620
 sorry turn off the phone and do it 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:17.709
 same procedure as before 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:20.350
 that at the post to click volume down will have to 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:24.459
 click the volume up then the button 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:28.540
 home power button and volume up in this 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:31.989
 In this case the phone starts up 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:34.750
 in recovery mode if the modes 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:36.730
 recovery is that touch means that the 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:39.180
 proceeding was therefore successful 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:39.180
 let's try 

00:03:47.960 --> 00:04:00.360
 perfect as you can see we can do 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:04:03.990
 see everything you see I'm touching with 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:06.330
 the screen the phone is all right 

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:11.480
 so this is the modified recovery 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:11.480
 touch and thanks to all bye
