00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.930
 I quickly start working 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.550
 for the press for the first magazine 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.610
 a magazine she for which I 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.590
 made portraits 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:34.200
 so I did a lot of portraits 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:37.020
 for a few years and I find that 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.250
 the portrait is a little school youth 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.720
 school also does not matter just as 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.430
 important than that of light because 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:42.540
 that it's grasping it's not easy to 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:47.300
 make portraits make a good one 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:50.370
 portrait in any case is gradually 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:56.580
 I started doing more and more 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:58.290
 naked and fashion parallel and I am 

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:00.030
 arrival 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:02.520
 so to make fashion series of 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.530
 portraits of nudes and now since 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:08.850
 two three years to make movies 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.780
 I came back to my first love and 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.520
 So here making short 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.770
 feature films of commercials 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.640
 little movies for me while continuing 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.640
 obviously the photograph 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:23.830
 fashion is actually the meeting of 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:26.050
 many things and that's why 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:27.700
 I put a little bit of time before 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:30.460
 work as a photographer from 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.200
 game mode because I always have 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:34.810
 thought she has a good fashion image 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:37.330
 it was also a mastery of 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:39.670
 portrait a mastery of light a 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:43.210
 mastery of color a mastery of 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:44.979
 garment and that the meeting everything is from 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:47.550
 all his talents constitute a good 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:47.550
 fashion image 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:54.729
 and it's often pretty bad at all 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:57.159
 case we have to accept that it gets old 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:59.500
 that be frozen in time all 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:02.670
 just because the dummies the 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:07.390
 make-up the hairstyle the clothes 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:09.929
 correspond to an area of ​​one year 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:09.929
 a period 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:19.490
 at least the best photographers of 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:22.460
 fashion are also very big 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:24.470
 portraitists with the portrait is a 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:24.830
 little sidelining is left for 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:28.700
 account 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:30.680
 that's it and I think it's 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.760
 really the basis of all reports 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.540
 humans because a photograph of 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.380
 fashion it's a relationship between a 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.380
 photographer and his model 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:42.550
 in fact I have always dreamed of having a 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:44.560
 mentor a great art director who 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:46.330
 directs me and air I start 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.830
 today with the years a 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:50.200
 finally met all these 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:52.720
 people who have me so much that I have so much 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.950
 admired in magazines precisely the 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.380
 vogue italy which for me is always 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:03:01.690
 been one of the references in terms 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:03.190
 sailing history at 100 we always have 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:05.050
 Finally, I've always waited for fashion 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:08.110
 Italian and mahidol stories by 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:13.140
 example as a single every month that 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:13.140
 do a little thing 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.280
 I love fashion when its doors and when 

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:26.470
 she is worn by girls when 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.490
 she is made by girls who are 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:30.040
 different from others 

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:33.220
 I have a big problem today with 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:36.100
 the globalization of looks in all 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:37.480
 capitals of the personalities of the 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:40.260
 girls everyone else look alike 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:40.260
 on his claim 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:55.909
 but favorite designers are I like 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:04:00.260
 a lot the work of nicolay up 

00:03:55.909 --> 00:04:04.250
 chabal old guy because but he has 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:06.010
 a taste and a unique vision that does not 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:08.150
 is inspired by people anyway he has 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:10.730
 decided obviously inspiration is 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:11.780
 certain but not at your designer 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:15.800
 have a thing of his own 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:19.880
 I like work 

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:21.380
 fire of celine fray even though I 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:23.120
 think it's pretty classic 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:26.810
 the cuts are absolutely 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:29.030
 incredibly flawless and modern 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:31.960
 while having plenty of inspiration from 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:36.539
 70s and 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:39.070
 I think it's very successful I like 

00:04:36.539 --> 00:04:41.140
 work 

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:43.510

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:49.840
 collection he managed a job 

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:52.720
 that's very accurate 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:54.550
 is the grandiose side and very 

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:56.580
 dressed in women but befits him to 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:56.580
 wonder
