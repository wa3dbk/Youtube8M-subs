00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.149
 Paradise only one rumor that she 

00:00:01.079 --> 00:00:03.959
 has requested in the future only on 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:05.910
 to play time 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:08.340
 that is the absolute court because 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.080
 he had seen the last season 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.400
 That was also the key to success 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.889
 store at home very stable and 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.260
 could implement our game i think 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.820
 the gate shows me that certain 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.990
 automatisms in the game we are 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:24.240
 Last year just from his team 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:25.680
 yes this situation then too 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.869
 recognize when must I press one must 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.480
 is the opponent force to errors and 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.230
 then immediately switch direction tor and 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.969
 make the goal 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.520
 we want to try to act boldly 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.390
 We usually want to try there 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.660
 arrive quickly 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:42.239
 We also had a week recently 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.040
 Home game against an opponent where we 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.989
 have been shown what we still have 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.760
 have to work out everything and where we are about 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.379
 still have deficits that has us very well 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.329
 we have done so we stay there too 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:54.449
 completely sober while contemplating 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:56.520
 we see ourselves as we then enrichment 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.649
 Doing everything for the class 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.350
 Keep going over the Ingolstadt city 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:03.059
 speaks a lot with the name of the trainers 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.150
 connected with ralph hasenhÃ¼ttl what makes 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.960
 he thinks that I like it so much 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.810
 do not forget 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.790
 thomas left really led to the well to us 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.670
 is in a certain time where we are like that 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:18.000
 have undergone normal development 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.200
 as a club and the two have it 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.970
 managed the team too 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.509
 stabilize the teams 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:26.189
 to give a face and he did it 

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:28.189
 Constancy in this in this team too 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:31.439
 bring and he is very authentic 

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:34.020
 experienced that before that brings this 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:36.329
 passion with and the team gives 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.710
 I have that back despite them 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.850
 of course, a question to you with this 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.200
 Goalkeeper rotation 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:45.210
 the times had all yes explain that is 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:47.549
 that always changed 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.210
 partner it is so we said before 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.460
 the season 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.510
 we need two strong goalkeepers 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.580
 because we do that with other teams 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:55.140
 have seen that there are always problems 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:57.000
 it was not that accurate either 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.820
 and the two are up and up 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.820
 if both hold as in the in the 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.930
 last weeks and that is then promoting 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.130
 the coach will be the right one 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:16.739
 make decisions that would be something for 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:18.620
 been you when the solution 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:20.580
 is working 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.700
 Do you think they are working away? 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:25.830
 duration 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:27.570
 I believe the goalkeeper needs trust 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:30.420
 I think the goalkeeper sometimes 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:32.130
 to go out for a weaker game 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.110
 must or without being questioned too 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:36.200
 Only then can he get his full 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.160
 perform well 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.840
 that will not work if he does 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.070
 if he knows if he only knows I am all 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.380
 two weeks over all three weeks only 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:45.450
 always ending will not be enough 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:47.489
 it bothers to unite with it then 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.900
 like wolfsburg and hoffheim compared 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:50.420
 to be thrown into a pot 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.319
 become 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:54.330
 that is ignorance 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:56.160
 because if you know us if you know us and 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:59.310
 when you see how the club is built 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.570
 is and I can only tell everyone 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.650
 have the door always open which can 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:02.340
 can come and look like us 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.650
 function 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.299
 and I think JÃ¶rg can do that too 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:07.350
 little to say about what the know 

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:09.930
 us already a bit longer 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:16.200
 there is a common past 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:17.660
 and his son continues on his side and 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:20.660
 has played with us 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:20.660
 Yes 

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:27.580
 I think I 'm good too 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:30.540
 learn that at least one in yours 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:30.540
 Family can play football 

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:43.180
 a bit thoughtful straight 

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:45.430
 looked as a holder against it 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:48.270
 interesting way and they act on 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:49.960
 me at the moment not as if she 

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:52.960
 get grants 

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:54.610
 they get extremely big and they whirl 

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:57.130
 not on the transfermarkt as if 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:58.150
 money does not matter but you 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:59.760
 also do not have as much money as 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:02.230
 maybe always outwardly presented 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:04.180
 I do not think she will be completely normal 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:06.460
 are set up to course 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:07.600
 one with one with someone 

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:09.220
 have the times over the 

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:09.940
 It can even help to overcome difficulties 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:12.160
 no question 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:14.650
 and if it succeeds, the 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:19.450
 also increasing their commitment also believes 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:21.660
 So there for the future continued 

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:21.660
 and the
