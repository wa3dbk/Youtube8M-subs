hello and welcome to module seven of
djing<00:00:17.850> for<00:00:18.060> beginners<00:00:18.420> and<00:00:18.660> this<00:00:19.439> module

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
djing for beginners and this module

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.200 
djing for beginners and this module
we're<00:00:20.070> going<00:00:20.099> to<00:00:20.340> show<00:00:20.550> you<00:00:20.610> how<00:00:20.730> to<00:00:20.939> blend

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
we're going to show you how to blend

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.659 
we're going to show you how to blend
your<00:00:21.420> two<00:00:21.630> records<00:00:22.110> together<00:00:22.400> okay<00:00:23.400> so<00:00:23.460> the

00:00:23.659 --> 00:00:23.669 
your two records together okay so the

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:24.980 
your two records together okay so the
first<00:00:23.700> plan<00:00:24.119> we're<00:00:24.330> going<00:00:24.480> to<00:00:24.540> look<00:00:24.660> at<00:00:24.810> is

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
first plan we're going to look at is

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.320 
first plan we're going to look at is
using<00:00:25.439> the<00:00:25.560> cross<00:00:25.740> fader<00:00:26.070> the<00:00:26.880> cross<00:00:27.119> fader

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
using the cross fader the cross fader

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.420 
using the cross fader the cross fader
allows<00:00:27.720> us<00:00:27.900> to<00:00:28.050> fade<00:00:28.289> between<00:00:28.500> two<00:00:29.009> channels

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:29.430 
allows us to fade between two channels

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:31.580 
allows us to fade between two channels
of<00:00:29.610> our<00:00:29.730> choice<00:00:29.939> on<00:00:30.239> the<00:00:30.360> mixer<00:00:30.720> we<00:00:31.320> can<00:00:31.470> go

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
of our choice on the mixer we can go

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.860 
of our choice on the mixer we can go
from<00:00:31.739> deck<00:00:32.040> a<00:00:32.250> to<00:00:32.759> deck<00:00:32.970> B<00:00:33.210> I'm<00:00:33.420> back<00:00:33.809> again

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
from deck a to deck B I'm back again

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.440 
from deck a to deck B I'm back again
just<00:00:34.800> by<00:00:34.950> going<00:00:35.100> from<00:00:35.399> left<00:00:35.579> to<00:00:35.850> right<00:00:36.059> on
