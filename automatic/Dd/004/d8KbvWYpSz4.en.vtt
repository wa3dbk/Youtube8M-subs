00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
general accessibility and this one's a

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.379 
general accessibility and this one's a
bit<00:03:17.880> more<00:03:18.030> useful<00:03:18.510> turn<00:03:19.500> that<00:03:19.680> off<00:03:20.209> don't<00:03:21.209> want

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:21.389 
bit more useful turn that off don't want

00:03:21.389 --> 00:03:25.160 
bit more useful turn that off don't want
that<00:03:21.600> and<00:03:21.840> I'm<00:03:22.680> going<00:03:22.920> to<00:03:22.980> go<00:03:23.100> to<00:03:23.160> zoom<00:03:24.170> alright

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
that and I'm going to go to zoom alright

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:29.390 
that and I'm going to go to zoom alright
so<00:03:25.440> then<00:03:25.739> turn<00:03:26.700> it<00:03:26.760> on<00:03:26.940> and<00:03:27.180> on<00:03:28.069> you<00:03:29.069> could<00:03:29.280> just

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
so then turn it on and on you could just

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.250 
so then turn it on and on you could just
read<00:03:29.760> the<00:03:29.970> instructions<00:03:30.389> here<00:03:30.569> or<00:03:30.900> I<00:03:30.959> could

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
read the instructions here or I could

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.770 
read the instructions here or I could
tell<00:03:31.470> you<00:03:31.590> so<00:03:32.130> to<00:03:32.220> zoom<00:03:32.519> you<00:03:32.850> DoubleTap<00:03:33.420> with

that's like I said to move around use
three<00:03:41.130> fingers<00:03:41.160> and<00:03:42.290> to<00:03:43.290> change<00:03:43.530> zoom<00:03:43.889> you<00:03:44.099> can

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
three fingers and to change zoom you can

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:47.300 
three fingers and to change zoom you can
double<00:03:44.519> pack<00:03:44.730> and<00:03:45.000> double<00:03:45.780> tap<00:03:46.049> and<00:03:46.380> drag<00:03:46.769> so

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.000 
let's try this let's go to here and then

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.629 
let's try this let's go to here and then
tap<00:03:51.000> with<00:03:51.239> double<00:03:51.690> type<00:03:51.810> of<00:03:51.930> three<00:03:52.109> and<00:03:52.920> that

and<00:03:58.980> a<00:03:59.099> pan<00:03:59.370> around<00:03:59.669> you<00:04:00.030> just<00:04:00.269> I<00:04:00.450> think<00:04:00.810> you

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
and a pan around you just I think you

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:03.620 
and a pan around you just I think you
can<00:04:01.049> just<00:04:01.200> get<00:04:01.319> y<00:04:01.349> 8<00:04:01.530> no<00:04:01.889> maybe<00:04:02.190> not<00:04:02.389> you<00:04:03.389> just

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:03.630 
can just get y 8 no maybe not you just

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:08.479 
can just get y 8 no maybe not you just
move<00:04:03.840> that<00:04:04.190> is<00:04:05.190> really<00:04:06.000> weird<00:04:07.040> like<00:04:08.040> hit<00:04:08.459> the

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:08.489 
move that is really weird like hit the

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:12.830 
move that is really weird like hit the
lock<00:04:08.790> screen<00:04:10.670> and<00:04:11.670> use<00:04:12.000> three<00:04:12.299> fingers<00:04:12.329> to

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 
lock screen and use three fingers to

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:16.520 
lock screen and use three fingers to
move<00:04:12.959> or<00:04:13.230> not<00:04:14.390> yeah<00:04:15.390> 30<00:04:15.720> G's<00:04:16.049> three<00:04:16.260> fingers

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:18.800 
move or not yeah 30 G's three fingers
from<00:04:16.680> around<00:04:16.890> I<00:04:17.010> guess<00:04:17.159> and<00:04:17.489> all<00:04:18.479> this<00:04:18.720> would

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:18.810 
from around I guess and all this would

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:21.110 
from around I guess and all this would
be<00:04:18.870> good<00:04:19.140> slide<00:04:19.799> unlock<00:04:20.039> there<00:04:20.820> is<00:04:20.940> how<00:04:21.060> you

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:21.120 
be good slide unlock there is how you

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:57.610 
know it's pretty beast um but anyway and

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:59.940 
know it's pretty beast um but anyway and
then<00:04:58.150> you<00:04:58.450> can<00:04:58.630> change<00:04:58.990> the<00:04:59.170> level<00:04:59.440> of<00:04:59.470> zoom<00:04:59.740> by

then you can change the level of zoom by

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:02.310 
then you can change the level of zoom by
tap<00:05:00.520> or<00:05:00.910> I<00:05:01.150> think<00:05:01.390> it's<00:05:01.510> double<00:05:01.780> tap<00:05:01.930> actually

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:02.320

tap or I think it's double tap actually
so<00:05:02.470> double<00:05:02.770> tap<00:05:02.920> and<00:05:03.220> then<00:05:03.370> drag<00:05:03.760> and<00:05:04.030> that<00:05:04.540> did

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:04.720 
so double tap and then drag and that did

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:31.780

kind of move your fingers that's really

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:40.590 
kind of move your fingers that's really
weird<00:05:38.610> so<00:05:39.610> I<00:05:39.640> don't<00:05:40.120> really<00:05:40.150> like<00:05:40.450> this

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:40.600 
weird so I don't really like this

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:44.100 
weird so I don't really like this
feature<00:05:40.900> either<00:05:41.050> and<00:05:41.650> I<00:05:42.570> kind<00:05:43.570> of<00:05:43.660> butchered

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:44.110 
feature either and I kind of butchered

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:45.600 
feature either and I kind of butchered
it<00:05:44.260> so<00:05:44.440> if<00:05:44.590> you<00:05:44.710> were<00:05:44.860> thinking<00:05:45.190> about<00:05:45.250> using

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:45.610 
it so if you were thinking about using

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:46.830 
it so if you were thinking about using
it<00:05:45.880> you're<00:05:45.970> probably<00:05:46.180> like<00:05:46.390> I'll<00:05:46.540> never<00:05:46.750> use

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:46.840 
it you're probably like I'll never use

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:48.660 
it you're probably like I'll never use
that<00:05:47.140> feature<00:05:47.350> but<00:05:48.190> at<00:05:48.280> least<00:05:48.400> you<00:05:48.520> know

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:48.670
