00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460 
there was a pillar in the middle and

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:02.709 
there was a pillar in the middle and
then<00:02:01.549> there<00:02:01.670> are<00:02:01.729> two<00:02:01.850> bars<00:02:02.119> coming<00:02:02.479> off<00:02:02.569> that

00:02:02.709 --> 00:02:02.719 
then there are two bars coming off that

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:04.480 
then there are two bars coming off that
central<00:02:03.139> pillar<00:02:03.380> and<00:02:03.770> then<00:02:04.009> on<00:02:04.130> each<00:02:04.280> of<00:02:04.429> the

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.490 
central pillar and then on each of the

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:05.950 
central pillar and then on each of the
bars<00:02:04.639> there<00:02:04.850> were<00:02:04.939> two<00:02:05.090> grips<00:02:05.299> so<00:02:05.539> up<00:02:05.630> to<00:02:05.780> four

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:05.960 
bars there were two grips so up to four

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:07.419 
bars there were two grips so up to four
people<00:02:06.170> could<00:02:06.289> work<00:02:06.409> it<00:02:06.530> at<00:02:06.619> once<00:02:06.799> I'm<00:02:07.039> not<00:02:07.280> on

00:02:07.419 --> 00:02:07.429 
people could work it at once I'm not on

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:08.889 
people could work it at once I'm not on
to<00:02:07.520> censure<00:02:07.850> what<00:02:08.030> the<00:02:08.149> crank<00:02:08.420> was<00:02:08.600> for<00:02:08.869> I

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
to censure what the crank was for I

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:10.059 
to censure what the crank was for I
think<00:02:09.110> it<00:02:09.170> was<00:02:09.259> to<00:02:09.380> turn<00:02:09.560> the<00:02:09.679> sail<00:02:09.920> or

00:02:10.059 --> 00:02:10.069 
think it was to turn the sail or

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:11.650 
think it was to turn the sail or
something<00:02:10.340> like<00:02:10.399> that<00:02:10.490> but<00:02:10.850> anyway<00:02:10.940> on<00:02:11.390> the

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
something like that but anyway on the

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:13.330 
something like that but anyway on the
crank<00:02:11.870> moved<00:02:12.200> really<00:02:12.500> really<00:02:12.800> quickly<00:02:13.160> like

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
crank moved really really quickly like

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.460 
crank moved really really quickly like
if<00:02:13.640> in<00:02:14.060> just<00:02:14.420> to<00:02:14.569> like<00:02:14.720> trust<00:02:15.050> me<00:02:15.230> this<00:02:15.350> will

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
if in just to like trust me this will

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:17.260 
if in just to like trust me this will
make<00:02:15.590> sense<00:02:15.770> later<00:02:15.860> but<00:02:16.190> if<00:02:16.370> the<00:02:16.670> two<00:02:16.850> guys<00:02:17.030> on

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:17.270 
make sense later but if the two guys on

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:19.000 
make sense later but if the two guys on
the<00:02:17.300> other<00:02:17.480> side<00:02:17.660> of<00:02:17.750> the<00:02:17.810> pillar<00:02:18.020> cranked<00:02:18.830> the

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
the other side of the pillar cranked the

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:20.620 
the other side of the pillar cranked the
crank<00:02:19.250> thing<00:02:19.430> our<00:02:19.640> crank<00:02:19.910> would<00:02:20.030> go<00:02:20.150> by<00:02:20.300> itself

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 
crank thing our crank would go by itself

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:22.240 
crank thing our crank would go by itself
just<00:02:20.990> to<00:02:21.110> show<00:02:21.230> you<00:02:21.290> guys<00:02:21.440> that<00:02:21.500> like<00:02:21.950> it's

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
just to show you guys that like it's

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.340

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:24.350 
connected so anyway we start cranking

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:26.020 
connected so anyway we start cranking
I'm<00:02:24.470> across<00:02:24.680> from<00:02:24.770> some<00:02:25.160> lady<00:02:25.430> that's<00:02:25.790> just

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:40.570 
cranking the crank it went really really
fast<00:02:39.410> I<00:02:39.560> felt<00:02:39.680> like<00:02:39.830> my<00:02:39.920> shoulder<00:02:40.280> was<00:02:40.400> about

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:40.580 
fast I felt like my shoulder was about

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:42.430 
fast I felt like my shoulder was about
to<00:02:40.700> pop<00:02:40.880> out<00:02:41.060> of<00:02:41.090> my<00:02:41.240> socket<00:02:41.510> at<00:02:41.720> any<00:02:41.960> moment

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
to pop out of my socket at any moment

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.260 
to pop out of my socket at any moment
but<00:02:42.740> then<00:02:42.890> this<00:02:43.430> lady<00:02:43.640> across<00:02:43.910> from<00:02:44.180> he

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:44.270 
but then this lady across from he

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:45.820 
but then this lady across from he
decides<00:02:44.570> to<00:02:44.720> be<00:02:44.870> like<00:02:45.050> weird<00:02:45.350> and<00:02:45.530> stuff<00:02:45.680> and

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:45.830

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
she lets go of the crank because I guess

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:48.670 
she lets go of the crank because I guess
she's<00:02:47.570> feeling<00:02:47.840> uncomfortable<00:02:48.320> or<00:02:48.440> whatever
