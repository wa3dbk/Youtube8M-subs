and<00:03:20.250> you're<00:03:20.340> gonna<00:03:20.430> laugh<00:03:20.700> at<00:03:20.850> the<00:03:20.940> fact<00:03:21.090> that

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239 
and you're gonna laugh at the fact that

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:23.360 
and you're gonna laugh at the fact that
it's<00:03:21.420> literally<00:03:21.870> a<00:03:21.900> tornado<00:03:22.200> filled<00:03:23.130> with

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
it's literally a tornado filled with

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.310 
it's literally a tornado filled with
sharks<00:03:23.730> the<00:03:23.940> thing<00:03:24.120> is<00:03:24.300> going<00:03:24.750> around<00:03:24.870> and

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:25.320 
sharks the thing is going around and

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:27.440 
sharks the thing is going around and
their<00:03:25.620> idea<00:03:26.010> of<00:03:26.070> how<00:03:26.250> to<00:03:26.310> stop<00:03:26.610> the<00:03:26.790> tornado<00:03:27.239> is

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
their idea of how to stop the tornado is

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:30.080 
their idea of how to stop the tornado is
to<00:03:27.570> go<00:03:27.750> up<00:03:27.870> in<00:03:27.989> a<00:03:28.050> helicopter<00:03:28.430> fly<00:03:29.430> right<00:03:29.700> next

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
to go up in a helicopter fly right next

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.540 
to go up in a helicopter fly right next
to<00:03:30.150> the<00:03:30.269> tornado<00:03:30.480> and<00:03:30.959> drop<00:03:31.410> bombs<00:03:31.800> into<00:03:32.459> the

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:32.550 
to the tornado and drop bombs into the

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:34.250 
to the tornado and drop bombs into the
tornado<00:03:32.970> because<00:03:33.150> the<00:03:33.450> bombs<00:03:33.750> will<00:03:34.110> then

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
tornado because the bombs will then

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.040 
tornado because the bombs will then
explode<00:03:34.950> the<00:03:35.220> tornado<00:03:35.730> kill<00:03:36.390> all<00:03:36.540> the<00:03:36.690> sharks

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:37.050 
explode the tornado kill all the sharks

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:39.590 
explode the tornado kill all the sharks
in<00:03:37.200> the<00:03:37.320> tornado<00:03:37.680> and<00:03:38.010> then<00:03:38.489> everyone<00:03:39.390> will<00:03:39.480> be

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:39.600 
in the tornado and then everyone will be

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.720 
in the tornado and then everyone will be
okay<00:03:39.930> somehow<00:03:40.410> I<00:03:40.680> don't<00:03:41.250> really<00:03:41.400> know<00:03:41.580> what

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
okay somehow I don't really know what

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:43.699 
okay somehow I don't really know what
the<00:03:41.820> logic<00:03:42.180> isn't<00:03:42.330> that<00:03:42.600> but<00:03:42.900> this<00:03:43.200> is<00:03:43.380> a<00:03:43.410> film

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
the logic isn't that but this is a film

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:46.520 
the logic isn't that but this is a film
where<00:03:43.980> sharks<00:03:44.340> breathe<00:03:44.790> on<00:03:45.120> land<00:03:45.180> so<00:03:46.110> you<00:03:46.410> know

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
where sharks breathe on land so you know

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:48.080 
where sharks breathe on land so you know
there<00:03:46.709> really<00:03:46.830> isn't<00:03:47.100> any<00:03:47.340> logic<00:03:47.700> at<00:03:47.790> all<00:03:47.940> I

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
there really isn't any logic at all I

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:49.430 
there really isn't any logic at all I
think<00:03:48.180> there<00:03:48.390> really<00:03:48.540> honestly<00:03:48.989> annoy<00:03:49.290> me

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
think there really honestly annoy me

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:50.750
