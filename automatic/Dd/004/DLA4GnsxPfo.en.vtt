have<00:00:48.930> working<00:00:49.860> with<00:00:49.980> the<00:00:50.129> AP<00:00:50.400> system<00:00:50.850> has<00:00:51.030> made

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:51.720 
have working with the AP system has made

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:55.040 
have working with the AP system has made
my<00:00:51.930> job<00:00:52.170> so<00:00:52.200> much<00:00:52.500> easier<00:00:52.700> the<00:00:53.700> tools<00:00:54.690> that<00:00:54.870> i

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
my job so much easier the tools that i

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.189 
my job so much easier the tools that i
can<00:00:55.230> use<00:00:55.260> and<00:00:56.900> information<00:00:57.900> you're<00:00:57.989> not<00:00:58.080> going

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
can use and information you're not going

00:00:58.199 --> 00:00:59.360 
can use and information you're not going
extract<00:00:58.530> out<00:00:58.680> of<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:58.800> system<00:00:58.949> is<00:00:59.190> just

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
extract out of the system is just

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.820 
extract out of the system is just
brilliant<00:00:59.629> the<00:01:00.629> day-to-day<00:01:00.930> management<00:01:01.500> is

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:01.830 
brilliant the day-to-day management is

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:04.369 
brilliant the day-to-day management is
just<00:01:02.580> so<00:01:02.850> much<00:01:02.970> easier<00:01:03.030> than<00:01:03.900> on<00:01:04.080> a<00:01:04.110> farm

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
just so much easier than on a farm

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.109 
just so much easier than on a farm
without<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.890> system<00:01:05.280> in<00:01:05.369> it<00:01:05.460> without<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:05.880> fe

help of Africa of my Kelly is to get
what<00:03:41.370> can<00:03:41.550> I<00:03:41.580> plant<00:03:41.880> us<00:03:42.150> to<00:03:42.300> get<00:03:42.480> to<00:03:42.750> 500<00:03:43.710> Kay's

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
what can I plant us to get to 500 Kay's

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.550 
what can I plant us to get to 500 Kay's
of<00:03:44.430> cap<00:03:44.640> five-eighths<00:03:45.270> of<00:03:45.390> 44,000<00:03:46.350> Kaiser

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
of cap five-eighths of 44,000 Kaiser

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:47.870 
of cap five-eighths of 44,000 Kaiser
month<00:03:46.830> so<00:03:46.980> it's<00:03:47.130> probably<00:03:47.310> eight<00:03:47.550> hundred

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:47.880 
month so it's probably eight hundred

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:50.000 
month so it's probably eight hundred
cows<00:03:48.090> and<00:03:48.480> I'm<00:03:49.020> sure<00:03:49.260> that's<00:03:49.590> definitely

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
cows and I'm sure that's definitely

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:53.300 
cows and I'm sure that's definitely
achievable<00:03:50.400> and<00:03:50.910> we<00:03:51.090> argued<00:03:51.450> together<00:03:52.310> the
