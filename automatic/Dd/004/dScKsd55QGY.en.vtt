you're<00:00:42.540> a<00:00:42.570> button<00:00:43.440> user<00:00:43.680> what's<00:00:44.460> happening

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
you're a button user what's happening

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.940 
you're a button user what's happening
with<00:00:44.879> me<00:00:45.090> is<00:00:45.270> often<00:00:45.809> my<00:00:45.899> but<00:00:46.140> my<00:00:46.320> finger<00:00:46.860> is

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
with me is often my but my finger is

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.090 
with me is often my but my finger is
drifting<00:00:47.340> up<00:00:47.489> into<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:47.789> touchpad<00:00:48.000> area<00:00:49.100> and

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
drifting up into the touchpad area and

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.459 
drifting up into the touchpad area and
then<00:00:50.280> it's<00:00:50.399> registering<00:00:50.910> obviously<00:00:51.270> as<00:00:51.449> a<00:00:51.480> as

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
then it's registering obviously as a as

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.979 
then it's registering obviously as a as
a<00:00:52.530> mouse<00:00:52.739> pointer<00:00:53.280> action<00:00:54.090> and<00:00:54.690> that<00:00:54.840> can

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
a mouse pointer action and that can

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.650 
a mouse pointer action and that can
affect<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:55.379> way<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:56.129> touchpad<00:00:56.340> works<00:00:57.210> I've

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
affect the way the touchpad works I've

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.270 
affect the way the touchpad works I've
seen<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.079> touchpad<00:00:58.260> lock<00:00:58.680> up<00:00:58.859> once<00:00:59.070> this

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
seen the touchpad lock up once this

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.049 
seen the touchpad lock up once this
evening<00:00:59.460> and<00:01:01.190> hasn't<00:01:02.190> happened<00:01:02.399> again<00:01:02.579> since

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
evening and hasn't happened again since

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.359 
evening and hasn't happened again since
that<00:01:03.510> was<00:01:04.260> when<00:01:04.439> I<00:01:04.470> brought<00:01:04.589> up<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:05.040> driver

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
that was when I brought up the driver

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.789 
that was when I brought up the driver
settings<00:01:06.270> for<00:01:06.720> the<00:01:06.810> touchpad<00:01:07.020> maybe<00:01:07.560> I

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
settings for the touchpad maybe I

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.020 
settings for the touchpad maybe I
shouldn't<00:01:08.280> have<00:01:08.369> done<00:01:08.520> that<00:01:08.580> but<00:01:08.790> I'll<00:01:08.909> keep

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
shouldn't have done that but I'll keep

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.850 
shouldn't have done that but I'll keep
an<00:01:09.210> eye<00:01:09.420> on<00:01:09.450> it<00:01:09.659> more<00:01:10.320> important<00:01:10.680> though<00:01:10.799> is

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
an eye on it more important though is

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.760 
an eye on it more important though is
the<00:01:11.010> keyboard<00:01:11.430> I<00:01:11.520> think<00:01:11.790> issue<00:01:12.540> there<00:01:13.140> is<00:01:13.409> it

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
the keyboard I think issue there is it

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.920 
the keyboard I think issue there is it
does<00:01:14.159> require<00:01:14.520> different<00:01:14.909> type<00:01:15.270> of<00:01:15.299> style<00:01:15.810> of

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
does require different type of style of

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.719 
does require different type of style of
typing<00:01:16.259> that<00:01:16.350> I'm<00:01:16.470> used<00:01:16.740> to<00:01:16.860> and<00:01:17.189> I<00:01:17.340> think

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
typing that I'm used to and I think

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.160 
typing that I'm used to and I think
that's<00:01:17.850> what's<00:01:18.630> happening<00:01:18.900> with<00:01:18.960> other

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
that's what's happening with other

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.800 
that's what's happening with other
reporters<00:01:20.130> as<00:01:20.310> well<00:01:20.520> and<00:01:21.000> we<00:01:21.090> just<00:01:21.270> zoom<00:01:21.330> in

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
reporters as well and we just zoom in

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.440 
reporters as well and we just zoom in
here<00:01:22.229> so<00:01:22.770> take<00:01:23.400> a<00:01:23.430> look<00:01:23.549> at<00:01:23.640> this<00:01:23.700> G<00:01:24.030> button<00:01:24.270> II

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
here so take a look at this G button II

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.530 
here so take a look at this G button II
can<00:01:24.720> you<00:01:24.810> see<00:01:24.990> the<00:01:25.110> way<00:01:25.229> that<00:01:25.409> wobbles<00:01:25.830> around

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:26.540 
can you see the way that wobbles around

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:30.980 
can you see the way that wobbles around
now<00:01:27.540> what<00:01:27.750> happens<00:01:28.140> is<00:01:28.460> it's<00:01:29.460> very<00:01:29.729> easy<00:01:30.000> to

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
now what happens is it's very easy to

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.289 
now what happens is it's very easy to
actually<00:01:31.140> hit<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:32.189> button<00:01:32.460> off-center<00:01:33.180> and

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
actually hit the button off-center and

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.300 
actually hit the button off-center and
then<00:01:33.570> to<00:01:33.900> actually<00:01:34.170> get<00:01:34.320> a<00:01:34.350> click<00:01:34.650> action<00:01:35.100> that

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
then to actually get a click action that

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.030 
then to actually get a click action that
doesn't<00:01:35.579> register<00:01:36.170> now<00:01:37.170> I'm<00:01:37.380> going<00:01:37.590> to<00:01:37.650> bring

going to be looking for the center of
the<00:02:32.860> keys<00:02:33.100> which<00:02:33.340> means<00:02:33.580> mean<00:02:33.700> concentration

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
the keys which means mean concentration

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:36.840 
the keys which means mean concentration
it's<00:02:35.020> not<00:02:35.170> good<00:02:35.320> for<00:02:35.350> touch<00:02:35.620> typists<00:02:36.280> and<00:02:36.400> you

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:36.850 
it's not good for touch typists and you

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:39.030 
it's not good for touch typists and you
also<00:02:37.030> have<00:02:37.300> to<00:02:37.420> slightly<00:02:37.870> i<00:02:38.110> think<00:02:38.440> raise<00:02:38.680> the

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
also have to slightly i think raise the

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.880 
also have to slightly i think raise the
the<00:02:39.070> hand<00:02:39.700> up<00:02:40.050> so<00:02:41.050> that<00:02:41.170> you<00:02:41.230> get<00:02:41.410> a<00:02:41.440> sort<00:02:41.860> of

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
the hand up so that you get a sort of

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:44.250 
the hand up so that you get a sort of
more<00:02:42.070> downward<00:02:42.670> angle<00:02:43.510> on<00:02:43.600> the<00:02:43.720> keys<00:02:43.959> as<00:02:44.230> well

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
more downward angle on the keys as well

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.210 
more downward angle on the keys as well
and<00:02:44.739> that<00:02:45.400> results<00:02:46.270> in<00:02:46.440> not<00:02:47.440> a<00:02:47.470> not<00:02:47.980> a<00:02:48.010> very

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
and that results in not a not a very

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:49.680 
and that results in not a not a very
comfortable<00:02:48.520> typing<00:02:48.730> experience<00:02:49.360> for<00:02:49.540> me

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
comfortable typing experience for me

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:51.920 
comfortable typing experience for me
it's<00:02:49.840> not<00:02:49.930> what<00:02:50.080> my<00:02:50.260> hands<00:02:50.860> are<00:02:50.980> used<00:02:51.160> to<00:02:51.370> so<00:02:51.610> i

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
it's not what my hands are used to so i

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.920 
it's not what my hands are used to so i
think<00:02:52.930> there<00:02:53.140> is<00:02:53.290> a<00:02:53.320> there<00:02:53.980> is<00:02:54.010> a<00:02:54.100> point<00:02:54.930> here

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
think there is a there is a point here

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:57.840 
think there is a there is a point here
that's<00:02:56.260> valid<00:02:56.830> that<00:02:57.010> the<00:02:57.070> keyboard<00:02:57.489> does<00:02:57.640> have

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:57.850 
that's valid that the keyboard does have

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:59.160 
that's valid that the keyboard does have

is going to have some issues for some

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:02.370 
is going to have some issues for some
people<00:02:59.530> and<00:02:59.850> depends<00:03:00.850> if<00:03:00.940> you're<00:03:01.209> a<00:03:01.450> heavy

use<00:03:05.200> an<00:03:05.620> ultrabook<00:03:05.950> as<00:03:06.670> a<00:03:06.730> keyboard<00:03:07.330> import

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750 
use an ultrabook as a keyboard import

use an ultrabook as a keyboard import
device<00:03:08.080> for<00:03:08.500> my<00:03:09.100> reports<00:03:10.030> and<00:03:10.680> of<00:03:11.680> course<00:03:11.920> the

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
device for my reports and of course the

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:14.280 
device for my reports and of course the
keyboard<00:03:12.190> needs<00:03:12.730> to<00:03:12.790> be<00:03:12.880> spot-on<00:03:13.510> for<00:03:13.660> me<00:03:13.989> so

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290 
keyboard needs to be spot-on for me so

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:16.170 
keyboard needs to be spot-on for me so
unfortunately<00:03:14.830> that's<00:03:15.340> almost<00:03:15.820> a<00:03:15.940> bit<00:03:16.030> of<00:03:16.120> a

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180 
unfortunately that's almost a bit of a

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:20.120 
unfortunately that's almost a bit of a
bit<00:03:16.930> of<00:03:17.049> a<00:03:17.170> roadblock<00:03:17.500> for<00:03:18.340> me<00:03:18.459> on<00:03:18.610> the<00:03:18.850> UX<00:03:19.060> 21

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
bit of a roadblock for me on the UX 21

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:22.800 
bit of a roadblock for me on the UX 21
the<00:03:21.130> keyboard<00:03:21.549> design<00:03:21.910> believe<00:03:22.360> is<00:03:22.480> the<00:03:22.570> same

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
the keyboard design believe is the same

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:24.840 
the keyboard design believe is the same
on<00:03:22.959> the<00:03:23.049> UX<00:03:23.260> 31<00:03:23.769> as<00:03:23.920> well<00:03:24.100> so<00:03:24.370> maybe<00:03:24.580> the<00:03:24.790> issue

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:24.850 
on the UX 31 as well so maybe the issue

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:27.330 
on the UX 31 as well so maybe the issue
is<00:03:25.269> there<00:03:25.540> i<00:03:25.570> can't<00:03:25.959> comment<00:03:26.650> on<00:03:26.950> that<00:03:27.190> because

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.340 
is there i can't comment on that because

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:31.500 
is there i can't comment on that because
i<00:03:27.489> haven't<00:03:27.670> to<00:03:28.000> test<00:03:28.480> it<00:03:28.690> but<00:03:30.060> you<00:03:31.060> can<00:03:31.299> reach

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:31.510 
i haven't to test it but you can reach

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:36.509 
i haven't to test it but you can reach
high<00:03:31.890> speed<00:03:32.890> a<00:03:32.920> high<00:03:33.489> rate<00:03:33.760> of<00:03:34.380> typing<00:03:35.380> but<00:03:35.980> it

00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:36.519 
high speed a high rate of typing but it

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:38.190 
high speed a high rate of typing but it
just<00:03:36.700> requires<00:03:37.030> more<00:03:37.209> concentration<00:03:37.420> to<00:03:38.049> do

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:38.200 
just requires more concentration to do

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:42.110 
just requires more concentration to do
it<00:03:38.790> okay<00:03:39.790> that's<00:03:39.970> just<00:03:40.180> a<00:03:40.450> very<00:03:40.660> quick<00:03:41.040> for<00:03:42.040> a
