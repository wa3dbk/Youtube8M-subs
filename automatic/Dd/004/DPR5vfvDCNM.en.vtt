00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.000
 PARAMOUNT PICTURES SHOWS 

00:00:03.501 --> 00:00:08.500
 I grew up in a harsh environment, sometimes a reputation follows you. 

00:00:08.501 --> 00:00:11.500
 Robert De Niro is Al Capone 

00:00:11.501 --> 00:00:16.000
 There is violence in Chicago, but not thanks to me, nor to anyone I employ 

00:00:16.001 --> 00:00:18.500
 and it's because it's not a good deal. 

00:00:22.501 --> 00:00:25.000
 Kevin Costner is Elliot Ness 

00:00:25.001 --> 00:00:29.000
 I swore to remove the man with any legal means 

00:00:29.001 --> 00:00:31.500
 which I will be available to do. 

00:00:31.501 --> 00:00:34.000
 Shawn Connery is Jimmy Malone 

00:00:34.001 --> 00:00:38.500
 Want to get Capone? That's how you get him. He pulls out the knife, the gun. 

00:00:38.501 --> 00:00:41.500
 He gets one of your people in the hospital, you get his man in the morgue, 

00:00:41.501 --> 00:00:43.000
 so it goes in Chicago. 

00:00:46.501 --> 00:00:49.000
 You have just been admitted to the state property administration. 

00:00:49.001 --> 00:00:52.000
 Everyone knows where the booze is, there's no problem finding it. 

00:00:52.001 --> 00:00:54.000
 Dem for it! 

00:00:54.001 --> 00:00:57.000
 The problem is who dares to go there. 

00:00:58.501 --> 00:01:02.000
 Someone plays with me, I play with him. 

00:01:04.001 --> 00:01:05.500
 Do you have a pass? Yes. 19 00: 01: 05,501 -&gt; 00: 00: 07,000 Take it with you. 

00:01:09.001 --> 00:01:11.500
 Hands Up, You're All Arrested! 

00:01:11.501 --> 00:01:13.000
 You guys are incorruptible. 

00:01:13.001 --> 00:01:18.500
 Do you think they can't reach you? There's something for everyone. 

00:01:18.501 --> 00:01:25.000
 So, bringing them to the station, if anything happens, shoot first. 

00:01:25.001 --> 00:01:29.000
 Let me tell you this if you want to see who wins the prize, 

00:01:29.001 --> 00:01:32.500
 you will wait until only one leg is left and you know who won. 

00:01:32.501 --> 00:01:36.000
 Just tell me, are you careful? Careful like a mouse. 

00:01:36.001 --> 00:01:41.000
 I want to hurt him, Malone. I want to bring the war to him. I want to give Capone something. 

00:01:42.001 --> 00:01:46.000
 This man can hurt Capone, he can get him behind bars. 

00:01:48.001 --> 00:01:50.500
 What's happening? Can't you talk to a gun in your mouth? 

00:01:50.501 --> 00:01:54.000
 I do not approve of your methods. 

00:01:54.001 --> 00:01:57.000
 Seriously? Well, probably because you're not from Chicago. 

00:01:57.001 --> 00:02:02.000
 I want you to find that Elliot Ness bust, I want him dead! His family dead! 

00:02:17.001 --> 00:02:21.000
 Paramount Pictures presents Brian De Palma's film 

00:02:21.001 --> 00:02:24.000
 I broke all the laws I swore to protect. 

00:02:24.001 --> 00:02:27.000
 I didn't, but I'm glad I did it. 

00:02:27.001 --> 00:02:31.000
 You have nothing! Nothing! If you were a guy, you would have done it. 

00:02:31.001 --> 00:02:33.700
 I will not stop fighting even. 

00:02:33.701 --> 00:02:37.000
