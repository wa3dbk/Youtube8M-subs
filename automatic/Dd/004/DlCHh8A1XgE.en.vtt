extremely successful he is a great
example<00:04:31.650> of<00:04:32.990> what<00:04:33.990> this<00:04:34.140> program<00:04:34.680> can<00:04:35.010> do<00:04:35.190> for

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:35.460 
example of what this program can do for

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:38.900 
example of what this program can do for
children<00:04:35.880> that<00:04:36.030> are<00:04:36.300> at<00:04:37.020> real<00:04:37.470> risk<00:04:37.560> of<00:04:38.190> going

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:38.910 
children that are at real risk of going

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:42.350 
children that are at real risk of going
in<00:04:39.240> a<00:04:39.330> very<00:04:39.600> different<00:04:40.470> direction<00:04:41.180> we<00:04:42.180> need

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:42.360 
in a very different direction we need

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:45.050 
in a very different direction we need
more<00:04:42.510> programs<00:04:42.840> like<00:04:43.380> this<00:04:43.650> this<00:04:44.490> is<00:04:44.700> like<00:04:44.880> one

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:45.060 
more programs like this this is like one

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:46.969 
more programs like this this is like one
in<00:04:45.180> a<00:04:45.270> million<00:04:45.570> right<00:04:45.750> now<00:04:45.930> how<00:04:46.530> many<00:04:46.590> of<00:04:46.770> you

00:04:46.969 --> 00:04:46.979 
in a million right now how many of you

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:49.040 
in a million right now how many of you
are<00:04:47.250> dying<00:04:47.820> every<00:04:48.000> day<00:04:48.180> killing<00:04:48.780> each<00:04:48.900> other

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:49.050 
are dying every day killing each other

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:51.620 
are dying every day killing each other
every<00:04:49.380> day<00:04:49.410> so<00:04:50.250> I<00:04:50.280> feel<00:04:50.760> if<00:04:51.000> we<00:04:51.150> had<00:04:51.330> more

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:51.630 
every day so I feel if we had more

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:53.980 
every day so I feel if we had more
programs<00:04:52.169> like<00:04:52.500> this<00:04:52.710> in<00:04:52.979> urban<00:04:53.400> communities

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:53.990 
programs like this in urban communities

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:57.469 
programs like this in urban communities
the<00:04:54.990> crime<00:04:55.350> rate<00:04:55.650> will<00:04:56.100> be<00:04:56.130> down<00:04:56.550> and<00:04:56.940> a<00:04:57.270> lot<00:04:57.419> of

00:04:57.469 --> 00:04:57.479 
the crime rate will be down and a lot of

00:04:57.479 --> 00:04:59.240 
the crime rate will be down and a lot of
kids<00:04:57.750> will<00:04:57.960> graduate<00:04:58.380> from<00:04:58.530> high<00:04:58.800> school<00:04:58.830> and
