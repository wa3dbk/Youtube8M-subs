that<00:02:53.519> you<00:02:53.610> get<00:02:53.760> like<00:02:53.910> with<00:02:54.090> my<00:02:54.209> Nikes<00:02:54.600> with

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
that you get like with my Nikes with

that you get like with my Nikes with
these<00:02:55.310> these<00:02:56.310> guys<00:02:56.549> these<00:02:56.880> are<00:02:57.090> 13<00:02:58.160> but<00:02:59.160> they

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
fit like 12 and supras so I suggest that

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:07.420 
fit like 12 and supras so I suggest that
you<00:03:03.480> get<00:03:03.660> a<00:03:03.989> size<00:03:04.890> or<00:03:05.310> half<00:03:05.640> size<00:03:05.970> down<00:03:06.410> from

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430 
you get a size or half size down from

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:10.820 
you get a size or half size down from
like<00:03:08.430> if<00:03:08.700> you<00:03:08.880> have<00:03:09.030> Nikes<00:03:09.450> get<00:03:10.410> half<00:03:10.590> a<00:03:10.680> size

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:10.830 
like if you have Nikes get half a size

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:12.740 
like if you have Nikes get half a size
down<00:03:11.010> if<00:03:11.069> you're<00:03:11.250> gonna<00:03:11.340> get<00:03:11.459> supras<00:03:11.940> because

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
down if you're gonna get supras because

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.539 
down if you're gonna get supras because
they<00:03:12.959> will<00:03:13.200> fit<00:03:13.380> differently<00:03:13.860> if<00:03:14.250> you<00:03:14.400> get<00:03:14.519> a

00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:14.549
