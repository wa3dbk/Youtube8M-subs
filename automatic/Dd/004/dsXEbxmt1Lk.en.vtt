00:00:00.909 --> 00:00:05.640
 16 plus two goalies reduced with in the squad course third-last Mount today 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.219
 after four injury break play again in goal 

00:00:09.219 --> 00:00:13.219
 but first of all Angus t today those are here member book suitability 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:14.259
 weakly 

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:17.259
 that we live again today or a lot of money in the previous week 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.500
 Jena's first chance 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.929
 in the eighth minute 

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:23.779
 Foul 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:24.789
 Schulz 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:28.989
 and yes there are still the Jenenser wall of the Lexus with Meixner and 

00:00:28.989 --> 00:00:29.899
 images 

00:00:29.899 --> 00:00:32.350
 and groom reacts too late 

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:35.370
 and after the first Brandenburger something 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.370
 one to zero 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:47.350
 Of course, the audience is satisfied 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:50.350
 You can get a better start 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:55.010
 the second Brandenburger showrooms 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:57.020
 this opinion 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:00.020
 Schulz and Vogel 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:05.019
 Schulz looks it looks long unsuccessful after only twelve minutes 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:08.490
 it is already two to zero for the Brandenburg 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:09.550
 the menu is 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:11.020
 effectiveness 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.240
 two attacks 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:14.570
 what more do you want 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:19.530
 Although as the fifth goal of the season Dr all very first in the second half and Perry 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:20.439
 groom 

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:23.380
 of course pretty down 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.380
 looking for a perspective continues from Brandenburg 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.260
 tried 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.060
 they were a bit embarrassed 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.250
 especially dangerous from standards 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.250
 like in this 2 rainstorm Polacek 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.020
 in the Krifteler 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.020
 surely it was too late a reaction 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:49.290
 Cheney if his 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.830
 Here we are standing not only scorer the scorer was 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:55.010
 of course to play a role as we see 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:58.010
 Hans Eder and his team take his 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:04.390
 at the investigators 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:08.200
 To make up for compensation but the Brandenburger counter over Andreas 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.849
 Lindner long sprint 

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:12.969
 and who shot the accident site 

00:02:12.969 --> 00:02:15.079
 a chance 

00:02:15.079 --> 00:02:18.259
 There, the whole place behind Dr 

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:21.399
 in the end the failing 

00:02:21.399 --> 00:02:22.649
 and Andreas Lemke 

00:02:22.649 --> 00:02:24.309
 is of course happy 

00:02:24.309 --> 00:02:26.529
 long injured this season 

00:02:26.529 --> 00:02:29.189
 his first you collect 

00:02:29.189 --> 00:02:32.669
 really a good game of St Andreas Hinkel 

00:02:32.669 --> 00:02:34.800
 maybe 1 to 25 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.899
 Minden 

00:02:36.899 --> 00:02:38.519
 everyone is tempted 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:41.989
 Circle MYK the most obvious man heard a big one had been stolen 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:46.289
 but he only hits the advertising posters 

00:02:46.289 --> 00:02:49.289
 put on superman sponsors in the picture 

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:54.319
 the counterattack against him would be determined 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:56.549
 the threshold position change 

00:02:56.549 --> 00:02:59.549
 bird species 

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:02.549
 to brag about many alibis Porsche 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:04.040
 Of course we had needs 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.179
 that makes the Vogler alone 

00:03:07.179 --> 00:03:09.579
 flashy man take 

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:11.809
 &amp; Cie court 

00:03:11.809 --> 00:03:13.769
 he must not be bad 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:17.509
 Groom Big d just after that he has probably seen that he goes over 

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:20.509
 Eckert the victorious power of his men Darms 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:24.929
 and everyone wants the re-goal before half time 

00:03:26.309 --> 00:03:27.649
 that is Weber 

00:03:27.649 --> 00:03:30.119
 today four claims game 

00:03:30.119 --> 00:03:32.559
 and there missed Kolleche check 

00:03:32.559 --> 00:03:34.499
 very close 

00:03:34.499 --> 00:03:38.359
 Their coach Bernd Stange he put his scorer Carsten Plate on the 

00:03:38.359 --> 00:03:39.419
 Bank 

00:03:39.419 --> 00:03:42.559
 a breather for the 21-year-old 

00:03:42.559 --> 00:03:47.409
 in the 45 then the citizens of Libya finish under an attractive first 

00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:48.530
 half 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:51.769
 with a deserved lead before 3300 

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:54.179
 72 for a long time 

00:03:54.179 --> 00:03:56.959
 certainly not enough 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:03:58.129
 in our hands 

00:03:58.129 --> 00:04:01.129
 with the first opportunity 

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:05.399
 Of course everyone wants more 

00:04:05.399 --> 00:04:08.729
 you can not be satisfied with the single 3 Peschke turns off 

00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:10.830
 always in the attack but that one 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:11.959
 the Brandenburgers 

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:15.009
 Of course dreams and you have to say that 

00:04:15.009 --> 00:04:17.029
 Use 

00:04:17.029 --> 00:04:18.340
 Gabriel 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:21.340
 the full-back on Foglar and he is brave 

00:04:22.719 --> 00:04:25.279
 Groom has to burst twice 

00:04:25.279 --> 00:04:26.559
 clear a corner 

00:04:26.559 --> 00:04:28.569
 as you say 

00:04:28.569 --> 00:04:30.759
 That's why we save singing 

00:04:30.759 --> 00:04:34.099
 for this corner of the Jenenser or descend darob 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:39.159
 in the six-meter room 

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:40.939
 completely free-standing shot 

00:04:40.939 --> 00:04:44.979
 since there are already 0 2 and not enough 62 minutes 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:49.550
 at the Le Mans 

00:04:50.819 --> 00:04:54.669
 The cards under his men once again on it are already to two canisters 

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:56.379
 he did not think so 

00:04:56.379 --> 00:05:00.259
 Bernd Stange restless on the bench but now on a hopeful one 

00:05:00.259 --> 00:05:03.259
 Postbank the strongest phase of Brandenburg 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:06.770
 high-caliber opportunities to choose from 

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:16.169
 some in the stands but from there it's just easier 

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:19.169
 1 on the lawn 

00:05:21.259 --> 00:05:25.209
 Corner of Jan Ott occurred as always from left and long shortly before 

00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:28.710
 changed for Childress Rhein 

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:31.479
 50 people gave 

00:05:31.479 --> 00:05:35.559
 which accumulates in this phase to absolute plus point 

00:05:36.089 --> 00:05:39.409
 the corners of right at Brandenburg occurs Schulz 

00:05:39.409 --> 00:05:42.779
 but not less dangerous than Senator Jon Kyl is there for a long time 

00:05:45.199 --> 00:05:48.199
 Willi shot position certainly can not be 

00:05:48.999 --> 00:05:52.959
 is the saddest of all that he forgave this good opportunity 

00:05:53.779 --> 00:05:54.680
 Brandenburg 

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:57.279
 continue on the handle 

00:05:57.279 --> 00:05:59.479
 Input of Schulz 

00:05:59.479 --> 00:06:02.479
 Although it continues to get in it 

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:06.400
 Werner Jurga always brought peace into play 

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:10.150
 he reported 

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:13.419
 with a tight shot 

00:06:13.419 --> 00:06:14.819
 but today came 

00:06:14.819 --> 00:06:17.029
 in top form 

00:06:17.029 --> 00:06:21.739
 Jena especially busy keeping the 1 2 residue but then patzte 

00:06:21.739 --> 00:06:26.349
 distracts and Kreisligist and Gabriele Elb certainly determine but 

00:06:26.349 --> 00:06:28.240
 referee 

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:30.130
 my dream once my friend 

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:32.400
 I mean the penalty whistle 

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:35.400
 had there his permission 

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:37.909
 Club head 

00:06:37.909 --> 00:06:40.419
 in the 82 minutes 

00:06:40.419 --> 00:06:43.229
 the Brandenburgers absolutely want the decision 

00:06:43.229 --> 00:06:45.979
 and the countries now have it abundantly 

00:06:45.979 --> 00:06:50.220
 an open slugfest really made Uli a great match for her relationships 

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:52.719
 that more viewers would have earned 

00:06:52.719 --> 00:06:55.309
 Polacek input and rape from 2 

00:06:55.309 --> 00:06:59.709
 and save the lovely 2 in the 88 minute 

00:07:00.979 --> 00:07:02.879
 Knef input tax changed 

00:07:02.879 --> 00:07:04.979
 Charlie Sheen not 

00:07:04.979 --> 00:07:07.979
 the Styrian be honest 

00:07:10.559 --> 00:07:11.409
 Handball HGA 

00:07:11.409 --> 00:07:15.630
 saves the 13 2 two important points for steel in a game 

00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:19.280
 by both claiming their eligibility for the second Bundesliga
