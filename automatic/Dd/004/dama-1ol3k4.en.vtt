00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:41.420 
flat surface so we'll start there okay

there<00:00:41.630> anyone<00:00:41.960> can<00:00:42.110> paint<00:00:42.350> a<00:00:42.410> flat<00:00:42.620> surface

00:00:42.819 --> 00:00:42.829 
there anyone can paint a flat surface

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:44.530 
there anyone can paint a flat surface
we've<00:00:43.250> all<00:00:43.399> done<00:00:43.579> it<00:00:43.670> before<00:00:43.790> you<00:00:43.970> pick<00:00:44.270> up<00:00:44.420> a

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:44.540 
we've all done it before you pick up a

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:46.180 
we've all done it before you pick up a
paintbrush<00:00:44.750> or<00:00:45.140> a<00:00:45.200> roller<00:00:45.500> and<00:00:45.770> go<00:00:45.920> for<00:00:46.160> it

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:46.190 
paintbrush or a roller and go for it

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:48.400 
paintbrush or a roller and go for it
unfortunately<00:00:46.670> most<00:00:47.480> of<00:00:47.660> us<00:00:47.810> as<00:00:47.960> images<00:00:48.290> we

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:48.410 
unfortunately most of us as images we

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:49.600 
unfortunately most of us as images we
tend<00:00:48.620> to<00:00:48.710> make<00:00:48.829> two<00:00:49.010> mistakes<00:00:49.160> with<00:00:49.550> a

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:49.610 
tend to make two mistakes with a

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:51.190 
tend to make two mistakes with a
paintbrush<00:00:49.910> the<00:00:50.210> first<00:00:50.420> thing<00:00:50.630> most<00:00:50.780> of<00:00:50.989> us<00:00:51.079> do

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:51.200 
paintbrush the first thing most of us do

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:52.810 
paintbrush the first thing most of us do
is<00:00:51.320> we<00:00:51.440> put<00:00:51.620> far<00:00:51.829> too<00:00:51.980> much<00:00:52.160> paint<00:00:52.460> onto<00:00:52.700> the

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:52.820 
is we put far too much paint onto the

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.479 
is we put far too much paint onto the
brush<00:00:53.090> the<00:00:53.870> second<00:00:54.320> thing<00:00:54.440> we<00:00:54.559> do<00:00:54.710> is<00:00:54.950> we've

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:55.489 
brush the second thing we do is we've

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:57.430 
brush the second thing we do is we've
been<00:00:55.640> these<00:00:55.880> bristles<00:00:56.180> there<00:00:57.020> as<00:00:57.110> soon<00:00:57.290> as<00:00:57.380> you

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:57.440 
been these bristles there as soon as you

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:58.750 
been these bristles there as soon as you
bend<00:00:57.620> the<00:00:57.680> bristles<00:00:58.040> like<00:00:58.160> that<00:00:58.370> on<00:00:58.489> a<00:00:58.550> flat

00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:58.760 
bend the bristles like that on a flat

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:00.040 
bend the bristles like that on a flat
surface<00:00:58.940> you're<00:00:59.360> painting<00:00:59.570> with<00:00:59.780> the<00:00:59.809> length

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:00.050 
surface you're painting with the length

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:01.600 
surface you're painting with the length
of<00:01:00.230> the<00:01:00.290> bristle<00:01:00.590> and<00:01:00.710> not<00:01:01.010> the<00:01:01.130> tips<00:01:01.370> and

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:01.610 
of the bristle and not the tips and

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:03.040 
of the bristle and not the tips and
that's<00:01:01.790> why<00:01:02.000> you<00:01:02.059> get<00:01:02.210> these<00:01:02.420> lines<00:01:02.660> and<00:01:02.840> brush

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:03.050 
that's why you get these lines and brush

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:04.420 
that's why you get these lines and brush
marks<00:01:03.379> through<00:01:03.559> there<00:01:03.800> whereas<00:01:04.369> a

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:04.430 
marks through there whereas a

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:05.889 
marks through there whereas a
professional<00:01:04.909> painter<00:01:05.180> knows<00:01:05.329> the<00:01:05.509> only<00:01:05.689> part

00:01:05.889 --> 00:01:05.899 
professional painter knows the only part

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:07.330 
professional painter knows the only part
of<00:01:05.960> a<00:01:06.049> brush<00:01:06.229> that<00:01:06.350> works<00:01:06.590> is<00:01:06.799> the<00:01:06.950> very<00:01:07.130> very

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:07.340 
of a brush that works is the very very

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.190 
of a brush that works is the very very
tip<00:01:07.490> of<00:01:07.520> the<00:01:07.670> bristle<00:01:08.000> now<00:01:08.630> on<00:01:08.780> these<00:01:08.929> flat

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:09.200 
tip of the bristle now on these flat

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.840 
tip of the bristle now on these flat
surfaces<00:01:09.709> you<00:01:09.829> could<00:01:10.069> use<00:01:10.249> a<00:01:10.280> roller<00:01:10.579> if<00:01:10.759> you

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:10.850 
surfaces you could use a roller if you

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:12.429 
surfaces you could use a roller if you
wanted<00:01:11.149> to<00:01:11.299> it<00:01:11.450> will<00:01:11.630> get<00:01:11.780> the<00:01:11.899> paint<00:01:12.109> on<00:01:12.259> this

00:01:12.429 --> 00:01:12.439 
wanted to it will get the paint on this

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:14.319 
wanted to it will get the paint on this
but<00:01:13.009> you<00:01:13.130> do<00:01:13.310> have<00:01:13.490> the<00:01:13.639> lightest<00:01:13.969> textured

00:01:14.319 --> 00:01:14.329 
but you do have the lightest textured

00:01:14.329 --> 00:01:15.520 
but you do have the lightest textured
finish<00:01:14.630> because<00:01:14.749> that's<00:01:14.990> what<00:01:15.139> a<00:01:15.170> roller<00:01:15.380> is

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:15.530 
finish because that's what a roller is

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:17.139 
finish because that's what a roller is
designed<00:01:15.649> to<00:01:15.979> give<00:01:16.189> you<00:01:16.369> know<00:01:16.789> that<00:01:16.969> when<00:01:17.090> you
