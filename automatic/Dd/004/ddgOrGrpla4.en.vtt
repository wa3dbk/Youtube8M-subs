to order some more rogue plates it's

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.410 
to order some more rogue plates it's
basically<00:00:47.160> there's<00:00:47.460> going<00:00:47.610> to<00:00:47.670> be<00:00:47.700> a<00:00:47.789> simple

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
basically there's going to be a simple

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.560 
basically there's going to be a simple
oval<00:00:48.960> I<00:00:49.489> don't<00:00:50.489> have<00:00:50.640> enough<00:00:50.879> room<00:00:51.149> to<00:00:51.420> do

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
oval I don't have enough room to do

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.200 
oval I don't have enough room to do
anything<00:00:51.780> else<00:00:52.170> so<00:00:52.860> singing<00:00:53.579> you<00:00:53.789> know

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
anything else so singing you know

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.450 
anything else so singing you know
another<00:00:54.570> straight<00:00:55.079> plate<00:00:55.739> over<00:00:56.070> here<00:00:56.309> where

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
another straight plate over here where

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.229 
another straight plate over here where
the<00:00:56.550> green<00:00:56.789> is<00:00:57.059> and<00:00:57.920> then<00:00:59.030> probably<00:01:00.030> leave

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
the green is and then probably leave

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.070 
the green is and then probably leave
that<00:01:00.480> green<00:01:00.750> plate<00:01:01.050> there<00:01:01.320> for<00:01:01.649> the<00:01:01.800> takeoff

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:03.080

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
put inside there i'm kind of leaving

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.300 
put inside there i'm kind of leaving
some<00:01:09.689> open<00:01:09.990> spots<00:01:10.200> basically<00:01:10.740> going<00:01:11.070> to<00:01:11.189> have

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
some open spots basically going to have

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.390 
some open spots basically going to have
it<00:01:11.490> where<00:01:11.700> you<00:01:12.510> have<00:01:12.720> enough<00:01:12.990> spaces<00:01:13.350> for<00:01:13.799> four

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
it where you have enough spaces for four

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.770 
it where you have enough spaces for four
cars<00:01:14.700> for<00:01:15.259> taking<00:01:16.259> off<00:01:16.380> their<00:01:17.060> got<00:01:18.060> some<00:01:18.299> tires

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
cars for taking off their got some tires

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.670 
cars for taking off their got some tires
around<00:01:19.229> the<00:01:19.380> corner<00:01:19.830> in<00:01:19.979> case<00:01:20.189> a<00:01:20.430> wreck<00:01:21.680> and

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
around the corner in case a wreck and

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.670 
around the corner in case a wreck and
you<00:01:22.710> won't<00:01:23.130> have<00:01:23.189> much<00:01:23.580> of<00:01:23.610> a<00:01:24.020> pit<00:01:25.020> crew<00:01:25.049> or<00:01:25.650> a

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
you won't have much of a pit crew or a

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.830 
you won't have much of a pit crew or a
area<00:01:26.400> here<00:01:26.610> in<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:26.790> middle<00:01:27.060> but<00:01:27.330> does<00:01:27.509> it<00:01:27.630> be

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
area here in the middle but does it be

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.390 
area here in the middle but does it be
basically<00:01:28.640> one<00:01:29.640> base<00:01:29.880> plate<00:01:30.799> well<00:01:31.799> I<00:01:31.829> mean<00:01:32.280> you

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
basically one base plate well I mean you

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.910 
basically one base plate well I mean you
have<00:01:32.579> a<00:01:32.610> little<00:01:32.850> extra<00:01:33.060> room<00:01:33.479> around<00:01:33.920> the

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
have a little extra room around the

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:40.520 
have a little extra room around the
edges<00:01:35.900> from<00:01:36.900> the<00:01:36.960> road<00:01:37.259> plates<00:01:38.210> then<00:01:39.530> well

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
edges from the road plates then well

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.219 
edges from the road plates then well
probably<00:01:40.920> a<00:01:41.159> thing<00:01:41.970> about<00:01:42.150> putting<00:01:42.509> up<00:01:42.630> like<00:01:42.899> i

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
probably a thing about putting up like i

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.060 
probably a thing about putting up like i
like<00:01:44.100> the<00:01:44.220> little<00:01:44.369> fencing<00:01:45.030> railing<00:01:45.540> around

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.070 
like the little fencing railing around

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:49.480 
like the little fencing railing around
up<00:01:47.070> there<00:01:47.100> and<00:01:47.670> having<00:01:47.880> the<00:01:48.090> flag<00:01:48.360> I<00:01:48.630> up<00:01:48.840> there

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490 
up there and having the flag I up there

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:53.210 
up there and having the flag I up there
we<00:01:50.490> have<00:01:50.640> a<00:01:50.700> quite<00:01:51.210> a<00:01:51.240> climb<00:01:51.799> to<00:01:52.799> get<00:01:52.950> up<00:01:53.070> there

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
we have a quite a climb to get up there

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.100 
we have a quite a climb to get up there
I<00:01:53.280> might<00:01:53.700> not<00:01:53.880> make<00:01:54.090> it<00:01:54.149> that<00:01:54.420> high<00:01:54.630> double

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
I might not make it that high double

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.120 
I might not make it that high double
high<00:01:55.259> like<00:01:55.470> that<00:01:55.500> but<00:01:57.320> and<00:01:58.320> go<00:01:58.560> I<00:01:58.590> might<00:01:59.009> have

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
high like that but and go I might have

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.590 
high like that but and go I might have
to<00:01:59.219> get<00:01:59.340> some<00:01:59.460> more<00:01:59.579> these<00:01:59.759> big<00:01:59.969> tires<00:02:00.240> that's

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
to get some more these big tires that's

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.520 
to get some more these big tires that's
all<00:02:00.750> I<00:02:00.780> got<00:02:01.079> enough<00:02:01.950> to<00:02:02.100> do<00:02:02.280> two<00:02:02.579> corners<00:02:03.210> I

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 
all I got enough to do two corners I

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.889 
all I got enough to do two corners I
could<00:02:04.530> do<00:02:04.710> smaller<00:02:05.329> tires<00:02:06.329> on<00:02:06.600> the<00:02:06.750> other

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
could do smaller tires on the other

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.440 
could do smaller tires on the other
corners<00:02:07.290> but<00:02:07.530> I'm<00:02:07.619> thinking<00:02:07.950> about<00:02:08.220> this

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
corners but I'm thinking about this

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.650 
corners but I'm thinking about this
ordering<00:02:09.450> up<00:02:09.690> some<00:02:09.869> more<00:02:10.020> bigger<00:02:10.259> tires<00:02:11.660> gonna

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
ordering up some more bigger tires gonna

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.850 
ordering up some more bigger tires gonna
have<00:02:12.780> to<00:02:12.930> get<00:02:13.110> rid<00:02:13.200> of<00:02:13.349> some<00:02:13.530> true

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
have to get rid of some true

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.660 
have to get rid of some true
he's<00:02:13.980> over<00:02:14.280> here<00:02:15.440> got<00:02:16.440> a<00:02:16.500> crew<00:02:16.890> I<00:02:17.220> got<00:02:17.550> the
