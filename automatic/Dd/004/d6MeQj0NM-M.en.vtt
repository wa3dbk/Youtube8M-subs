we're<00:00:04.799> going<00:00:05.009> over<00:00:05.130> properties<00:00:05.670> of<00:00:05.819> rational

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:06.029 
we're going over properties of rational

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:08.120 
we're going over properties of rational
numbers<00:00:06.540> today<00:00:06.750> we're<00:00:07.500> going<00:00:07.620> to<00:00:07.710> review

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
numbers today we're going to review

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.160 
numbers today we're going to review
commutative<00:00:08.849> and<00:00:09.030> associative<00:00:09.330> property<00:00:09.990> and

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
commutative and associative property and

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:58.160 
commutative and associative property and
then<00:00:10.650> we'll<00:00:10.830> get<00:00:10.920> to<00:00:11.070> the<00:00:11.099> new<00:00:11.309> stuff

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.500 

and<00:00:59.170> here's<00:00:59.980> the<00:01:00.129> new<00:01:00.250> stuff<00:01:00.550> the<00:01:01.000> identity

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:01.510 
and here's the new stuff the identity

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:04.500 
and here's the new stuff the identity
property<00:01:01.719> of<00:01:02.050> addition<00:01:02.670> essentially<00:01:03.670> if<00:01:03.910> you

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:04.510 
property of addition essentially if you

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:06.300 
property of addition essentially if you
had<00:01:04.629> zero<00:01:04.659> to<00:01:05.140> a<00:01:05.170> number<00:01:05.530> you're<00:01:05.979> going<00:01:06.130> to<00:01:06.190> get

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:06.310 
had zero to a number you're going to get

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:15.360 
had zero to a number you're going to get
the<00:01:06.400> same<00:01:06.610> number

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:15.370 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:17.720 

you

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:17.730 

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:19.340 

I<00:01:17.820> didn't<00:01:18.510> mean<00:01:18.600> property<00:01:19.020> of<00:01:19.080> multiplication

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
I didn't mean property of multiplication

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.310 
I didn't mean property of multiplication
if<00:01:19.920> you<00:01:20.280> multiply<00:01:20.670> a<00:01:20.700> number<00:01:20.970> by<00:01:21.150> one<00:01:21.510> you're

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
if you multiply a number by one you're

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.260 
if you multiply a number by one you're
going<00:01:22.500> to<00:01:22.590> get<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:22.830> same<00:01:23.070> number<00:01:23.270> it's

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
going to get the same number it's

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:32.880 
going to get the same number it's
basically<00:01:24.720> that<00:01:25.230> simple

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:32.890 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:35.080 

next<00:01:33.890> is<00:01:34.070> the<00:01:34.219> inverse<00:01:34.520> property<00:01:35.000> of

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.090 
next is the inverse property of

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:38.440 
next is the inverse property of
multiplication<00:01:36.250> which<00:01:37.250> is<00:01:37.280> the<00:01:37.850> product<00:01:38.240> of<00:01:38.329> a

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 
multiplication which is the product of a

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:39.910 
multiplication which is the product of a
rational<00:01:38.929> number<00:01:38.960> and<00:01:39.320> its<00:01:39.439> multiplicative

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
rational number and its multiplicative

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.999 
rational number and its multiplicative
inverses<00:01:40.340> 1<00:01:40.929> there's<00:01:41.929> essentially<00:01:42.259> what<00:01:42.799> that

00:01:42.999 --> 00:01:43.009 
inverses 1 there's essentially what that

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:46.779 
inverses 1 there's essentially what that
is<00:01:43.219> is<00:01:43.490> if<00:01:43.969> you<00:01:44.299> take<00:01:44.810> a<00:01:44.869> fraction<00:01:45.609> and<00:01:46.609> you

00:01:46.779 --> 00:01:46.789 
is is if you take a fraction and you

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:48.249 
is is if you take a fraction and you
multiply<00:01:46.939> it<00:01:47.210> by<00:01:47.360> its<00:01:47.689> multiplicative

00:01:48.249 --> 00:01:48.259 
multiply it by its multiplicative

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:50.350 
multiply it by its multiplicative
inverse<00:01:48.740> or<00:01:49.039> otherwise<00:01:49.819> known<00:01:50.030> as<00:01:50.209> your

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:50.360 
inverse or otherwise known as your

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.160 
inverse or otherwise known as your
reciprocal<00:01:51.200> you're<00:01:52.159> going<00:01:52.340> to<00:01:52.399> get<00:01:52.520> one<00:01:53.170> so

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
reciprocal you're going to get one so

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.240 
reciprocal you're going to get one so
here's<00:01:54.799> an<00:01:54.920> example<00:01:56.289> wait<00:01:57.289> for<00:01:57.560> it<00:01:57.709> wait<00:01:57.950> for

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.250 
here's an example wait for it wait for

00:01:58.250 --> 00:01:59.169 
here's an example wait for it wait for
it<00:01:58.490> there<00:01:58.759> it<00:01:58.850> is

00:01:59.169 --> 00:01:59.179 
it there it is

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:04.179 
it there it is
3/4<00:01:59.869> times<00:02:01.359> its<00:02:02.359> reciprocal<00:02:02.750> is<00:02:03.259> 4/3<00:02:03.799> and

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:04.189 
3/4 times its reciprocal is 4/3 and

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:08.169 
3/4 times its reciprocal is 4/3 and
that's<00:02:04.700> going<00:02:04.819> to<00:02:04.880> equal<00:02:04.939> 1<00:02:06.130> if<00:02:07.130> we<00:02:07.759> look<00:02:07.970> at<00:02:08.149> a

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179 
that's going to equal 1 if we look at a

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:11.050 
that's going to equal 1 if we look at a
mixed<00:02:08.630> number<00:02:09.280> here<00:02:10.280> our<00:02:10.429> mixed<00:02:10.670> number<00:02:10.940> is

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
mixed number here our mixed number is

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.690 
mixed number here our mixed number is
going<00:02:11.239> to<00:02:11.299> be<00:02:11.450> 1<00:02:11.959> in<00:02:11.989> 3/4<00:02:12.680> the<00:02:13.099> first<00:02:13.370> thing<00:02:13.549> we

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
going to be 1 in 3/4 the first thing we

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.750 
going to be 1 in 3/4 the first thing we
have<00:02:13.849> to<00:02:13.880> do<00:02:14.120> is<00:02:14.420> make<00:02:15.410> it<00:02:15.440> an<00:02:15.829> improper

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
have to do is make it an improper

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.440 
have to do is make it an improper
fraction<00:02:17.360> so<00:02:17.680> 1<00:02:18.680> in<00:02:18.799> 3/4<00:02:19.310> says<00:02:19.670> an<00:02:19.879> improper

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
fraction so 1 in 3/4 says an improper

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.039 
fraction so 1 in 3/4 says an improper
fraction<00:02:20.480> is<00:02:21.160> 7/4<00:02:22.450> from<00:02:23.450> here<00:02:23.690> we<00:02:23.870> can

00:02:24.039 --> 00:02:24.049 
fraction is 7/4 from here we can

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:27.670 
fraction is 7/4 from here we can
multiply<00:02:24.379> by<00:02:24.829> its<00:02:25.129> reciprocal<00:02:25.569> which<00:02:26.569> is<00:02:26.810> 4/7

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
multiply by its reciprocal which is 4/7

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:32.020 
multiply by its reciprocal which is 4/7
so<00:02:28.610> the<00:02:29.180> reciprocal<00:02:29.629> for<00:02:30.170> 1<00:02:31.160> and<00:02:31.310> 3/4<00:02:31.879> is

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
so the reciprocal for 1 and 3/4 is

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:37.510 
so the reciprocal for 1 and 3/4 is
actually<00:02:32.890> 4/7<00:02:33.890> which<00:02:34.579> will<00:02:34.790> give<00:02:34.940> you<00:02:35.090> 1
