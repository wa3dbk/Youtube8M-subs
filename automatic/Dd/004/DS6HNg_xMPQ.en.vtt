00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:10.260
 dries mertens in form has 1 83 m rating 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:13.980
 but 89 85 83 shot and 84 pass 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.780
 right foot force motors has left me 47 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.690
 cost nine goals in four games 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.830
 scored and given a goal submission so 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.570
 quite good statistics there ever 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.350
 made a set in game already something 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.850
 recognize 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.470
 because they are full of my abilities 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.750
 Pretty good, what a shot 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.310
 dribbling and adjusting and so on 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.869
 Much of it sets without problems 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.700
 in the square around the book is correct 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.649
 every time he is 89 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.570
 abnormally fast running defender 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:40.170
 Friends felt so much everyone and can 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.520
 why free spaces run our link 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.290
 is also extreme and you can 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.270
 Advantages sketched wonderfully use 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.010
 to really extreme so it can also 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.600
 narrowest room meanwhile one man at all 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.370
 can turn and turn very fast 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.160
 all the next positive aspect 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.840
 calls also because he is also quite good 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:01:00.359
 the conclusion is also good and good 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:02.789
 that makes the left foot is also in the 16er 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.930
 as strong as his right long shot 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.519
 you can also like you just spent 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.150
 Viewed with him without problems 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.689
 want to do 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:11.310
 the treasury is relatively good and with that 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.740
 that's why you can also go out there 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.770
 distance without problems these points are 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.869
 on the one hand, of course, a body part 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:20.220
 37 strength in ingame stats is already 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.990
 shit when it is completely honest I 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.850
 believe if it really only works here 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.950
 and who has in the tackle also is 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.130
 Meanwhile too 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:30.659
 I look great estimates 99% away 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:32.250
 And his walks are not quite 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.369
 top i would have been at march was high medium 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.840
 working guessing but going on is noisy picture 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.790
 with a lot better difficult in the 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.040
 the statute can simply be long forward 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.659
 but different is already real 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.460
 difficult in somehow to the ball too 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.329
 get and therefore leave the 187 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.790
 points anyway 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:49.110
 we had extremely fallen especially 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.880
 because of problems , especially because of his 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.890
 fast mainly because of its very good 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:56.490
 conclusion of me in the end the 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:59.549
 in 9.0 out of 10 and actually quite 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:02.009
 good upgrade for 740 quite good left 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:05.040
 wings in the series are then still 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:05.969
 shaarawy but otherwise there is already 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.960
 me and I have really a good one 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:09.360
 alternative especially for which 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.940
 teams, for example, manuela actually 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.710
 has now 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:15.770
 you can have a cheap variant in the 

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:18.410
 principle of the good ideas but that was 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:19.370
 celebrate it again in this playoff 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:20.810
 I have a bit faster 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:23.210
 rusted we still have quite a lot of 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:30.110
 scenes because an absolute idiot sits 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:31.190
 here next to me 80 edward I broke 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:33.050
 hope you can live with that is 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:34.490
 now it's a bit chaotic 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:36.110
 simple is just varied 

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:44.600
 Today, not boring anymore 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:46.280
 otherwise you will learn it earlier 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.500
 or later, probably later than 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:50.570
 later he knows very well about the iss 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.700
 also quite later in the series we 

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:54.200
 together make a pretty idiot and 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.850
 Accordingly, the series will be hers 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.170
 not can of you could be the 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:00.170
 Write comments less than mine 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:01.370
 no it's not maxi though that too 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:04.790
 A fun that's also do not want 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:08.480
 although the match also grinst now 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:10.910
 I know what I mean from Andy's player 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:12.830
 reviews comments like her mertens in 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:13.580
 form of fc played but the comments 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:17.450
 we still see 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:19.340
 chorin idiot segment before mÃ¼ller what man 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:23.709
 just so see comments no matter the 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:23.709
 It was really I want to give it to him 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:35.260
 and I say temporarily at least 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:39.020
 pure idiot otherwise would have to greet with 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:43.510
 hello first that videos over me 

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:43.510
 I want to greet the maxi It's over
