 the cool air through the device 

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:21.740
 hunting in the reason it is already

 almost from lenovo thinkpad x1 now 

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:27.650

 an ultrabook and a short keyboard 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:35.840
 We are well known here from Lenovo

 the trackpoint we have the touchpad on 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:40.640
 the possibility in the entire touchpad too 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:42.040
 clicking that means moving here gives that 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:44.270
 entire touchpad after 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:46.480
 and we have a point of view 

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:49.010
 after a very good keyboard is called 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:50.690
 ordinary pressure point and can be here 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:53.690

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:56.810
 write longer texts yes in the reason is 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:58.250
