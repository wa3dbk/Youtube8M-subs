00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
but at the same time I can use

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.109 
but at the same time I can use
dissensions<00:01:07.590> in<00:01:07.799> other<00:01:08.010> areas<00:01:08.400> such<00:01:08.520> as<00:01:08.580> QbD

00:03:46.399 --> 00:03:46.409 
range gear as well I don't know if you

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:48.020 
range gear as well I don't know if you
guys<00:03:46.470> saw<00:03:46.680> it<00:03:46.739> but<00:03:46.799> I<00:03:46.859> had<00:03:46.979> over<00:03:47.159> a<00:03:47.190> 500<00:03:47.760> cash

stack and then I you know spent Bank on
the<00:03:50.129> Ascension<00:03:50.549> so<00:03:50.669> we<00:03:50.760> still<00:03:50.909> got<00:03:51.000> 182<00:03:51.720> MLF

00:03:52.189 --> 00:03:52.199 
the Ascension so we still got 182 MLF

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:54.559 
the Ascension so we still got 182 MLF
and<00:03:53.099> then<00:03:53.220> you<00:03:53.310> guys<00:03:53.430> are<00:03:53.549> gonna<00:03:53.669> see<00:03:53.940> shortly

00:03:54.559 --> 00:03:54.569 
and then you guys are gonna see shortly

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:56.330 
and then you guys are gonna see shortly
once<00:03:55.019> it<00:03:55.139> cuts<00:03:55.290> into<00:03:55.409> the<00:03:55.530> clip<00:03:55.709> at<00:03:55.859> the<00:03:55.889> QED

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
once it cuts into the clip at the QED

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:59.000 
once it cuts into the clip at the QED
what<00:03:57.120> i've<00:03:57.239> been<00:03:57.359> doing<00:03:57.540> i've<00:03:58.049> been<00:03:58.739> taking

what i've been doing i've been taking
mahogany<00:03:59.639> logs<00:04:00.150> and<00:04:00.510> making<00:04:00.780> them<00:04:00.900> into

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
mahogany logs and making them into

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:02.960 
mahogany logs and making them into
planks<00:04:01.500> on<00:04:01.650> the<00:04:01.889> sawmill<00:04:02.340> and<00:04:02.549> also<00:04:02.729> getting

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
planks on the sawmill and also getting

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:04.759 
planks on the sawmill and also getting
protein<00:04:03.180> planks<00:04:03.629> back<00:04:03.870> you<00:04:04.319> guys<00:04:04.470> know<00:04:04.650> what

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:04.769 
protein planks back you guys know what

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:05.360 
protein planks back you guys know what
that<00:04:04.949> is

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
that is

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:08.119 
that is
protein<00:04:05.909> planks<00:04:06.209> are<00:04:06.299> basically<00:04:06.720> a<00:04:07.129> cosmetic

00:04:08.119 --> 00:04:08.129 
protein planks are basically a cosmetic

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:10.520 
protein planks are basically a cosmetic
item<00:04:08.489> that<00:04:08.790> you<00:04:08.879> can<00:04:09.000> use<00:04:09.359> in<00:04:09.629> substitute<00:04:10.319> for

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 
item that you can use in substitute for

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:13.699 
item that you can use in substitute for
any<00:04:10.650> plank<00:04:10.979> you<00:04:11.099> want<00:04:11.370> so<00:04:12.199> I've<00:04:13.199> been<00:04:13.349> doing

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:13.709 
any plank you want so I've been doing

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:15.949 
any plank you want so I've been doing
that<00:04:13.949> sort<00:04:14.760> of<00:04:14.849> kinda<00:04:15.209> as<00:04:15.359> you<00:04:15.510> see<00:04:15.690> right<00:04:15.930> now

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:15.959 
that sort of kinda as you see right now

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:18.439 
that sort of kinda as you see right now
I've<00:04:16.680> been<00:04:16.709> doing<00:04:17.039> that<00:04:17.159> so<00:04:17.489> you<00:04:17.519> put<00:04:17.820> it<00:04:17.909> on<00:04:18.000> it

00:04:18.439 --> 00:04:18.449 
I've been doing that so you put it on it

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:19.909 
I've been doing that so you put it on it
turns<00:04:18.630> into<00:04:18.810> mahogany<00:04:19.229> planks<00:04:19.409> and<00:04:19.680> you<00:04:19.769> get

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:19.919 
turns into mahogany planks and you get

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:21.680 
turns into mahogany planks and you get
protein<00:04:20.250> planks<00:04:20.549> back<00:04:20.789> and<00:04:21.060> then<00:04:21.479> basically

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:21.690 
protein planks back and then basically

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:23.120 
protein planks back and then basically
you<00:04:21.870> know<00:04:21.959> you<00:04:21.989> go<00:04:22.200> back<00:04:22.229> you<00:04:22.529> sell<00:04:22.710> the<00:04:22.800> planks

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.130 
you know you go back you sell the planks

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:24.350 
you know you go back you sell the planks
and<00:04:23.219> whatnot<00:04:23.550> and<00:04:23.700> then<00:04:23.820> you<00:04:23.880> have<00:04:24.029> protein

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 
and whatnot and then you have protein

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.510 
and whatnot and then you have protein
planks<00:04:24.659> bla<00:04:24.870> bla<00:04:25.110> bla<00:04:25.229> and<00:04:25.590> you<00:04:26.219> know<00:04:26.310> it's

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520 
planks bla bla bla and you know it's

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:27.470 
planks bla bla bla and you know it's
pretty<00:04:26.700> cool<00:04:26.940> you<00:04:27.270> know

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:27.480 
pretty cool you know

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:28.760 
pretty cool you know
not<00:04:27.600> gonna<00:04:27.690> lie<00:04:27.840> it's<00:04:28.080> it's<00:04:28.260> a<00:04:28.320> little<00:04:28.560> boring

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:28.770 
not gonna lie it's it's a little boring

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:30.440 
not gonna lie it's it's a little boring
at<00:04:28.920> times<00:04:28.950> as<00:04:29.220> little<00:04:29.430> grindy<00:04:29.790> but<00:04:30.240> each

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:30.450 
at times as little grindy but each

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:32.420 
at times as little grindy but each
sawmill<00:04:31.080> if<00:04:31.770> you're<00:04:31.950> paying<00:04:32.130> full<00:04:32.370> attention

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:32.430 
sawmill if you're paying full attention

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:34.970 
sawmill if you're paying full attention
you<00:04:32.970> can<00:04:33.090> almost<00:04:33.360> do<00:04:33.840> a<00:04:33.870> thousand<00:04:34.410> logs<00:04:34.620> in

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:34.980 
you can almost do a thousand logs in

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:37.730 
you can almost do a thousand logs in
five<00:04:35.400> minutes<00:04:36.050> I'm<00:04:37.050> not<00:04:37.320> sure<00:04:37.470> how<00:04:37.590> many

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:37.740 
five minutes I'm not sure how many

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:38.870 
five minutes I'm not sure how many
protein<00:04:38.100> planks<00:04:38.340> you're<00:04:38.430> gonna<00:04:38.550> get<00:04:38.670> out<00:04:38.850> of

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:38.880 
protein planks you're gonna get out of

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:40.910 
protein planks you're gonna get out of
that<00:04:39.060> I<00:04:39.090> haven't<00:04:39.330> actually<00:04:39.600> you<00:04:40.260> know<00:04:40.380> tested

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:40.920 
that I haven't actually you know tested

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:41.990 
that I haven't actually you know tested
that<00:04:41.070> because<00:04:41.280> it's<00:04:41.460> a<00:04:41.550> different<00:04:41.850> amount

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000 
that because it's a different amount

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.420 
that because it's a different amount
every<00:04:42.270> time<00:04:42.480> it's<00:04:42.690> all<00:04:42.810> random<00:04:43.070> so<00:04:44.070> you<00:04:44.160> got<00:04:44.310> to

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:44.430 
every time it's all random so you got to
