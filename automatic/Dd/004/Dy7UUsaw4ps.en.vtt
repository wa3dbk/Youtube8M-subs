00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:10.150

 sale on April 1 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:15.880
 many people thought it was a joke 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:17.410
 but it did not finally go on sale I 

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:19.300
 I bought it thinking it would be bigger 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:21.310
 but then I realized that it was 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:23.289
 little girl so we're not going to open it 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:27.430
 I just received it and see what it is 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:29.020
 that this quadrocopters offers us 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:30.610
 little toy so to speak but 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:34.840
 good since I bought it at least in 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:38.130
 the unboxing and show you details 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:38.130
 I knew that the patient 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.680
 and well here we have what is the super 

00:00:43.289 --> 00:00:49.699
 quadripopter of one plus one that of r1 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:52.469
 here you can see it is pretty tiny 

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:55.440
 only weighs about 12 grams comes for 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:57.149
 upload it via usb I understand that 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.789
 the battery is tiny of only 1000 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:02.369
 milliamp about 100,000 pawns sorry 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:07.649
 here come some options of what 

00:01:02.369 --> 00:01:10.350
 brings more or less endurance in flight about 5 

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:13.229
 8 minutes depending on how you use it 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.520
 demos and it loads in about 20 minutes like this 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.390
 that we 're not going to open it and see what it is 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.390
 that offers 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:19.990
 Y 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:33.550
 to get it out here we have what is the 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:35.890
 helicopter you can see in comparison 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:38.290
 with my hand the little thing that is imagined 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:41.310
 that will have to be removed in some way and 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:41.310
 here in the background 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:47.119
 we have here we have the super command 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:49.040
 that is also pretty tiny here 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:51.630
 you have it, let's see if we can 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:54.590
 open 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.590
 one second 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:04.010
 when that is also pretty tiny 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:05.690
 and well I imagine that here is for the 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:07.670
 different options and so I have 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:09.380
 understood you have to remove this screw 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:12.470
 which is where the batteries of the 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:16.300
 device and here we also have 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.300
 some little things we are going to open it 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.810
 let's see how we open this without breaking 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.330
 here you can open 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:34.100
 and well here what can we 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:37.610
 find is how the 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:39.500
 device and also comes a 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:42.170
 small instruction manual the 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:46.610
 screwdriver for imagine to remove 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:48.500
 the battery cover a usb charger and 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:50.690
 some spare propellers as you can 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:53.770
 see around here so nothing let's see if 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:56.950
 we got the pot out of here 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:58.570
 a little entertaining and now in mind 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:00.280
 this removed as I teach that such is 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:03.310
 good once you have achieved 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:05.020
 take out the gadget here you can see how 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:06.910
 has the entry to load it with the 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:08.980
 microusb cable the power button and 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:11.710
 turn off and nothing is a very very device 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:13.150
 light very tiny and here in command 

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:14.920
 Well, we will simply have to extract 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.390
 with the screwdriver that brings the lid 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:18.550
 back put two piles of these from the 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:21.430
 finite and would be ready to work 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:22.320
 to make it work you have to leave it 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:24.430
 clicking here 

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:27.340
 you see that I would already be blinking 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:29.230
 different colors and now therefore what 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:31.780
 would do is turn on the command the command will 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:33.820
 turn to the left and once 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:35.240
 that is on, it would be ready 

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:37.190
 to take off 

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:40.120
 so nothing we go if I get it done 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:40.120
 take off until later
