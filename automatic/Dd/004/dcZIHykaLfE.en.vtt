my<00:00:37.350> opinion<00:00:38.090> because<00:00:39.090> if<00:00:39.270> you<00:00:39.390> put<00:00:39.570> it<00:00:39.660> back<00:00:39.809> on

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
my opinion because if you put it back on

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.690 
my opinion because if you put it back on
safe<00:00:40.320> while<00:00:40.530> the<00:00:40.649> blades<00:00:40.920> out<00:00:41.129> you<00:00:41.460> can't

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
safe while the blades out you can't

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.970 
safe while the blades out you can't
close<00:00:42.000> it<00:00:42.059> at<00:00:42.360> all<00:00:42.480> push<00:00:43.350> over<00:00:43.649> the<00:00:43.739> little

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.150 
close it at all push over the little
slide<00:00:44.280> and<00:00:44.780> it<00:00:45.780> nothing<00:00:46.230> happens<00:00:46.260> it's<00:00:46.920> very

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
slide and it nothing happens it's very

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.830 
slide and it nothing happens it's very
nice<00:00:47.370> you<00:00:48.149> don't<00:00:48.329> got<00:00:48.450> to<00:00:48.539> worry<00:00:48.570> about

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
nice you don't got to worry about

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.869 
nice you don't got to worry about
cutting<00:00:49.440> your<00:00:49.620> fingers<00:00:50.100> because<00:00:50.520> the<00:00:50.640> blade

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
cutting your fingers because the blade

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.549 
cutting your fingers because the blade
wants<00:00:51.180> to<00:00:51.270> close<00:00:51.510> when<00:00:51.840> you're<00:00:51.960> opening<00:00:52.260> a<00:00:52.350> box

very<00:00:57.899> durable<00:00:58.559> in<00:00:59.190> my<00:00:59.370> experience<00:00:59.969> so<00:01:00.180> far<00:01:00.210> I

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
very durable in my experience so far I

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.560 
very durable in my experience so far I
use<00:01:01.379> it<00:01:01.590> quite<00:01:01.949> a<00:01:02.010> bit<00:01:02.129> every<00:01:02.609> day<00:01:02.640> and<00:01:03.180> as<00:01:03.390> you

use it quite a bit every day and as you
see<00:01:03.809> just<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.589> finishes<00:01:05.129> starting<00:01:05.970> to<00:01:06.150> wear

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
see just the finishes starting to wear

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.899

on<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.659> knife<00:01:07.040> the<00:01:08.040> blade<00:01:08.070> down<00:01:08.490> here<00:01:08.729> towards

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
on the knife the blade down here towards

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.719 
on the knife the blade down here towards
the<00:01:09.090> tip<00:01:09.360> is<00:01:09.600> starting<00:01:10.260> to<00:01:10.409> get<00:01:10.619> some<00:01:11.520> little

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
the tip is starting to get some little

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.929 
the tip is starting to get some little
jagged<00:01:12.270> spots<00:01:12.799> but<00:01:13.799> that<00:01:13.979> hasn't<00:01:14.189> taken<00:01:14.580> away

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
jagged spots but that hasn't taken away

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.260 
jagged spots but that hasn't taken away
from<00:01:15.000> its<00:01:15.600> ability<00:01:16.229> to<00:01:16.259> cut<00:01:16.740> and<00:01:17.009> I'm<00:01:17.939> sure<00:01:18.119> if

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
from its ability to cut and I'm sure if

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:19.820 
from its ability to cut and I'm sure if
I<00:01:18.360> just<00:01:18.540> gave<00:01:18.689> it<00:01:18.900> a<00:01:18.930> nice<00:01:19.110> little<00:01:19.320> sharpening

real<00:01:20.040> quick<00:01:20.250> those<00:01:20.520> would<00:01:20.820> go<00:01:21.509> away<00:01:23.570> this

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570
