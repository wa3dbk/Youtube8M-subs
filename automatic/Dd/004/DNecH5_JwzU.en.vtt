their purchases which means we ship

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.460 
their purchases which means we ship
these<00:00:25.580> containers<00:00:26.120> what<00:00:26.780> are<00:00:26.870> you<00:00:27.050> doing<00:00:27.350> to

these containers what are you doing to

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:29.220 
these containers what are you doing to
try<00:00:27.650> to<00:00:27.680> cope<00:00:28.040> with<00:00:28.220> this<00:00:28.370> current<00:00:28.580> situation

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:29.230 
try to cope with this current situation

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:32.829 
try to cope with this current situation
with<00:00:30.230> our<00:00:30.440> challenges<00:00:31.280> that<00:00:32.000> we<00:00:32.270> already<00:00:32.450> have

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:32.839 
with our challenges that we already have

00:00:32.839 --> 00:00:35.799 
with our challenges that we already have
our<00:00:32.870> ships<00:00:33.379> so<00:00:34.249> what<00:00:34.579> we<00:00:34.699> can<00:00:34.850> do<00:00:35.030> is<00:00:35.269> try<00:00:35.719> to

00:00:35.799 --> 00:00:35.809 
our ships so what we can do is try to

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:39.279 
our ships so what we can do is try to
put<00:00:36.170> them<00:00:36.410> where<00:00:36.920> there's<00:00:37.280> more<00:00:37.460> cargo<00:00:37.850> we<00:00:38.659> put

00:00:39.279 --> 00:00:39.289 
put them where there's more cargo we put

00:00:39.289 --> 00:00:41.470 
put them where there's more cargo we put
out<00:00:39.409> the<00:00:39.589> speed<00:00:39.890> down<00:00:40.129> and<00:00:40.460> make<00:00:40.879> sure<00:00:41.089> that<00:00:41.329> we

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:41.480 
out the speed down and make sure that we

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:43.479 
out the speed down and make sure that we
utilize<00:00:41.929> the<00:00:42.140> capacity<00:00:42.800> we<00:00:42.920> have<00:00:42.949> best

00:00:43.479 --> 00:00:43.489 
utilize the capacity we have best

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:46.180 
utilize the capacity we have best
possible<00:00:44.059> but<00:00:44.539> we<00:00:44.659> also<00:00:44.839> do<00:00:45.170> stop<00:00:45.499> investing

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:46.190 
possible but we also do stop investing

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:48.579 
possible but we also do stop investing
in<00:00:46.370> new<00:00:46.640> capacity<00:00:47.390> in<00:00:47.659> an<00:00:47.899> environment<00:00:48.559> like

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:48.589 
in new capacity in an environment like

00:00:48.589 --> 00:00:50.410 
in new capacity in an environment like
this<00:00:48.890> so<00:00:49.429> do<00:00:49.609> you<00:00:49.699> think<00:00:49.760> that<00:00:50.030> you<00:00:50.210> might<00:00:50.390> have

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:50.420 
this so do you think that you might have

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.770 
this so do you think that you might have
to<00:00:50.659> idle<00:00:51.109> any<00:00:51.409> ships<00:00:51.739> or<00:00:51.979> lay<00:00:52.159> off<00:00:52.309> workers<00:00:52.780> yes

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:53.780 
to idle any ships or lay off workers yes

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:56.590 
to idle any ships or lay off workers yes
that<00:00:54.050> that<00:00:54.229> might<00:00:54.469> be<00:00:55.339> the<00:00:55.519> outcome<00:00:55.909> we<00:00:56.390> have<00:00:56.569> a

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:56.600 
that that might be the outcome we have a

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.399 
that that might be the outcome we have a
large<00:00:57.109> fleet<00:00:57.710> of<00:00:58.059> 470<00:00:59.059> container<00:00:59.449> ships<00:00:59.809> but

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:00.409 
large fleet of 470 container ships but

00:01:00.409 --> 00:01:02.020 
large fleet of 470 container ships but
it's<00:01:00.589> not<00:01:00.739> unlikely<00:01:01.069> that<00:01:01.429> we'll<00:01:01.609> have<00:01:01.789> truly

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:02.030 
it's not unlikely that we'll have truly

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:04.420 
it's not unlikely that we'll have truly
up<00:01:02.300> let's<00:01:02.600> say<00:01:02.780> 10<00:01:03.019> to<00:01:03.170> 20<00:01:03.499> ship<00:01:03.710> at<00:01:04.040> one<00:01:04.250> point

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:04.430 
up let's say 10 to 20 ship at one point

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:06.639 
up let's say 10 to 20 ship at one point
of<00:01:04.610> time<00:01:04.640> how<00:01:05.540> soon<00:01:05.869> do<00:01:06.079> you<00:01:06.140> think<00:01:06.200> that<00:01:06.500> might

00:01:06.639 --> 00:01:06.649 
of time how soon do you think that might

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:09.100 
of time how soon do you think that might
happen<00:01:06.829> well<00:01:07.430> it's<00:01:07.820> a<00:01:07.969> seasonal<00:01:08.450> business<00:01:08.600> and

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.110 
happen well it's a seasonal business and

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:11.649 
happen well it's a seasonal business and
our<00:01:09.649> low<00:01:09.920> season<00:01:10.189> is<00:01:10.490> that<00:01:10.670> is<00:01:10.850> absolutely

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:11.659 
our low season is that is absolutely

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:14.499 
our low season is that is absolutely
first<00:01:11.930> quarter<00:01:12.380> and<00:01:12.500> that<00:01:13.490> might<00:01:13.729> be<00:01:13.909> the<00:01:13.969> time

00:01:14.499 --> 00:01:14.509 
first quarter and that might be the time

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:16.389 
first quarter and that might be the time
but<00:01:14.689> we<00:01:14.780> have<00:01:14.930> to<00:01:15.079> take<00:01:15.259> that<00:01:15.500> step<00:01:15.710> so<00:01:16.070> then<00:01:16.250> in

00:01:16.389 --> 00:01:16.399 
but we have to take that step so then in

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:19.779 
but we have to take that step so then in
another<00:01:16.490> month<00:01:17.090> or<00:01:17.270> two<00:01:17.950> absolutely<00:01:18.950> yes<00:01:19.189> how

00:01:19.779 --> 00:01:19.789 
another month or two absolutely yes how

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:22.539 
another month or two absolutely yes how
serious<00:01:20.390> do<00:01:20.539> you<00:01:20.600> think<00:01:20.840> this<00:01:21.020> downturn<00:01:21.920> might

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:22.549 
serious do you think this downturn might

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:25.840 
serious do you think this downturn might
be<00:01:22.729> well<00:01:23.689> right<00:01:24.409> now<00:01:24.649> it<00:01:24.920> is<00:01:25.039> kind<00:01:25.430> of<00:01:25.610> serious

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:25.850 
be well right now it is kind of serious

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:28.539 
be well right now it is kind of serious
we<00:01:26.270> are<00:01:26.600> used<00:01:27.049> to<00:01:27.229> see<00:01:27.409> always<00:01:27.680> highest<00:01:28.310> growth

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:28.549 
we are used to see always highest growth

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:31.389 
we are used to see always highest growth
of<00:01:28.789> the<00:01:28.909> export<00:01:29.359> after<00:01:29.719> China<00:01:30.049> now<00:01:30.799> it's<00:01:31.130> it's

00:01:31.389 --> 00:01:31.399 
of the export after China now it's it's

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:34.149 
of the export after China now it's it's
flat<00:01:31.759> if<00:01:32.000> not<00:01:32.299> actually<00:01:32.810> declining<00:01:33.560> compared

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:34.159 
flat if not actually declining compared

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:36.639 
flat if not actually declining compared
to<00:01:34.310> last<00:01:34.490> yeah<00:01:34.909> the<00:01:35.570> big<00:01:35.750> question<00:01:36.170> is<00:01:36.320> will<00:01:36.590> it

00:01:36.639 --> 00:01:36.649 
to last yeah the big question is will it

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:38.859 
to last yeah the big question is will it
go<00:01:37.009> on<00:01:37.039> for<00:01:37.430> one<00:01:37.609> year<00:01:37.850> will<00:01:38.030> it<00:01:38.149> go<00:01:38.299> on<00:01:38.420> for<00:01:38.689> two

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:38.869 
go on for one year will it go on for two

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:41.800 
go on for one year will it go on for two
year<00:01:39.170> as<00:01:39.350> far<00:01:39.680> as<00:01:39.770> we<00:01:39.920> can<00:01:40.070> see<00:01:40.310> at<00:01:40.579> least<00:01:40.810> 2009

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810 
year as far as we can see at least 2009

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.260 
year as far as we can see at least 2009
it's<00:01:42.109> going<00:01:42.350> to<00:01:42.439> be<00:01:42.590> very<00:01:42.859> difficult<00:01:43.210> what<00:01:44.210> do

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
it's going to be very difficult what do

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.599 
it's going to be very difficult what do
you<00:01:44.359> think<00:01:44.539> is<00:01:44.659> going<00:01:44.840> to<00:01:44.929> help<00:01:45.200> drive<00:01:45.710> trade

00:01:46.599 --> 00:01:46.609 
you think is going to help drive trade

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:48.849 
you think is going to help drive trade
going<00:01:47.030> forward<00:01:47.750> especially<00:01:47.990> since<00:01:48.560> we're<00:01:48.770> in

00:01:48.849 --> 00:01:48.859 
going forward especially since we're in

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:49.149 
going forward especially since we're in
this

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:49.159 
this

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:51.690 
this
very<00:01:49.310> precarious<00:01:50.090> environment<00:01:50.780> of<00:01:50.869> the<00:01:50.960> stage

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:51.700 
very precarious environment of the stage

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.520 
very precarious environment of the stage
the<00:01:52.700> most<00:01:52.909> important<00:01:53.479> factor<00:01:53.899> is<00:01:54.049> that<00:01:54.350> the
