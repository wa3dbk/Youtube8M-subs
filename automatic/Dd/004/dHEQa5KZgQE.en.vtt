to get a hundred in that box and then in

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.350 
to get a hundred in that box and then in
here<00:01:50.250> we<00:01:50.280> have<00:01:50.670> some<00:01:50.939> more<00:01:51.149> imported<00:01:51.869> ficus

in they'll put one of the very large

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.270 
in they'll put one of the very large
trees<00:02:16.330> in<00:02:16.630> the<00:02:16.780> carton<00:02:17.230> first<00:02:17.620> and<00:02:18.130> then

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
trees in the carton first and then

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.880 
trees in the carton first and then
they'll<00:02:18.490> start<00:02:18.900> adding<00:02:19.900> these<00:02:20.080> smaller<00:02:20.530> guys

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
they'll start adding these smaller guys

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.100
