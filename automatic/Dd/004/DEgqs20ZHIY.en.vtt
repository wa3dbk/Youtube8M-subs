try to record an acoustic guitar direct
this<00:02:34.880> would<00:02:35.060> be<00:02:35.180> probably<00:02:35.930> a<00:02:36.140> good<00:02:36.500> pre<00:02:36.920> for

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:37.820 
this would be probably a good pre for

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:39.970 
this would be probably a good pre for
that<00:02:37.970> if<00:02:38.150> you're<00:02:38.300> looking<00:02:38.600> for<00:02:38.630> a<00:02:39.080> real<00:02:39.560> open

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
that if you're looking for a real open

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:43.360 
that if you're looking for a real open
top<00:02:40.250> end<00:02:40.490> that<00:02:40.670> is<00:02:41.230> so<00:02:42.230> if<00:02:42.770> you're<00:02:42.980> looking<00:02:43.340> for

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
top end that is so if you're looking for

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:48.390 
top end that is so if you're looking for
a<00:02:43.580> really<00:02:44.450> top<00:02:45.200> quality<00:02:46.300> uncompromised<00:02:47.300> just

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
a really top quality uncompromised just

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.510 
a really top quality uncompromised just
full<00:02:49.810> full<00:02:50.810> bandwidth<00:02:51.290> preamp<00:02:51.800> with<00:02:51.980> a<00:02:52.010> little

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:52.520 
full full bandwidth preamp with a little

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:55.600 
full full bandwidth preamp with a little
more<00:02:52.700> focus<00:02:53.360> on<00:02:53.510> an<00:02:53.660> open<00:02:53.870> top<00:02:54.290> end<00:02:54.560> this<00:02:55.370> would

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:55.610 
more focus on an open top end this would

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:58.210 
more focus on an open top end this would
be<00:02:55.760> a<00:02:55.970> great<00:02:56.300> choice<00:02:56.600> and<00:02:56.990> I<00:02:57.680> think<00:02:57.950> most

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
be a great choice and I think most

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.570 
be a great choice and I think most
people<00:02:58.640> that<00:02:58.880> get<00:02:59.360> a<00:02:59.420> designs<00:02:59.960> pries<00:03:00.580> would

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:01.580 
people that get a designs pries would

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:04.930 
people that get a designs pries would
probably<00:03:02.240> want<00:03:02.870> to<00:03:03.170> eventually<00:03:03.680> have<00:03:03.940> more

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940 
probably want to eventually have more

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:08.170 
probably want to eventually have more
than<00:03:05.120> one<00:03:05.590> if<00:03:06.590> budget<00:03:07.040> were<00:03:07.340> allowed<00:03:07.700> to<00:03:07.730> have

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
than one if budget were allowed to have

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:10.750 
than one if budget were allowed to have
one<00:03:09.050> of<00:03:09.110> the<00:03:09.230> pre's<00:03:09.470> that<00:03:09.800> would<00:03:09.950> suit<00:03:10.430> some

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 
one of the pre's that would suit some

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.350 
one of the pre's that would suit some
applications<00:03:11.440> 12<00:03:12.440> others<00:03:12.980> of<00:03:13.430> course<00:03:13.490> you

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:14.360 
applications 12 others of course you

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:17.080 
applications 12 others of course you
could<00:03:14.570> run<00:03:15.470> this<00:03:15.590> prion<00:03:16.280> kick<00:03:16.550> drum<00:03:16.820> it<00:03:16.970> was

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.090 
could run this prion kick drum it was

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:19.720 
could run this prion kick drum it was
done<00:03:17.450> great<00:03:17.780> you<00:03:18.320> can<00:03:18.500> run<00:03:18.680> it<00:03:18.800> on<00:03:18.860> any<00:03:19.100> input

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:19.730 
done great you can run it on any input

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:21.910 
done great you can run it on any input
in<00:03:19.880> it<00:03:19.970> would<00:03:20.060> sound<00:03:20.240> great<00:03:20.480> but<00:03:20.780> I<00:03:21.560> definitely

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:21.920 
in it would sound great but I definitely

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:26.050 
in it would sound great but I definitely
think<00:03:22.300> snare<00:03:23.350> overheads<00:03:24.350> a<00:03:24.820> vocal<00:03:25.820> that<00:03:25.940> you

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.060 
think snare overheads a vocal that you

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:28.810 
think snare overheads a vocal that you
want<00:03:26.209> to<00:03:26.300> really<00:03:26.510> open<00:03:26.810> top<00:03:27.140> in<00:03:27.380> would<00:03:27.590> be<00:03:27.820> you

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:28.820 
want to really open top in would be you

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:31.020 
want to really open top in would be you
