00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:28.460 
this door is split it's mostly because

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:30.550 
this door is split it's mostly because
it's<00:00:28.730> such<00:00:28.910> form<00:00:29.240> of<00:00:29.359> materials<00:00:30.140> that<00:00:30.230> is<00:00:30.380> made

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:30.560 
it's such form of materials that is made

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:32.560 
it's such form of materials that is made
out<00:00:30.740> of<00:00:30.769> and<00:00:31.279> tonight<00:00:32.060> I'm<00:00:32.239> going<00:00:32.360> to<00:00:32.419> take

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:32.570 
out of and tonight I'm going to take

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:34.840 
out of and tonight I'm going to take
this<00:00:32.719> back<00:00:32.930> apart<00:00:33.289> you<00:00:33.530> know<00:00:33.680> glue<00:00:34.219> and<00:00:34.520> clamp

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:34.850 
this back apart you know glue and clamp

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:36.369 
this back apart you know glue and clamp
this<00:00:35.180> end<00:00:35.480> down<00:00:35.629> here<00:00:35.690> to<00:00:35.960> keep<00:00:36.079> it<00:00:36.260> from

00:00:36.369 --> 00:00:36.379 
this end down here to keep it from

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:38.709 
this end down here to keep it from
getting<00:00:36.500> worse<00:00:36.760> but<00:00:37.760> the<00:00:37.910> main<00:00:38.149> problem<00:00:38.359> is

00:00:38.709 --> 00:00:38.719 
getting worse but the main problem is

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:40.750 
getting worse but the main problem is
that<00:00:38.750> the<00:00:39.020> hole<00:00:39.289> in<00:00:39.710> here<00:00:40.399> where<00:00:40.579> this

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:40.760 
that the hole in here where this

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:48.240 
that the hole in here where this
adjuster<00:00:41.329> goes<00:00:42.140> up<00:00:42.350> in<00:00:42.559> is<00:00:43.300> so<00:00:44.300> worn<00:00:44.840> out<00:00:45.050> that

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:48.250 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:50.740 

the<00:00:49.250> adjuster<00:00:49.699> just<00:00:49.910> keeps<00:00:50.180> falling<00:00:50.359> out<00:00:50.629> and

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:50.750 
the adjuster just keeps falling out and

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.220 
the adjuster just keeps falling out and
it's<00:00:50.840> just<00:00:50.989> making<00:00:51.170> it<00:00:51.379> split<00:00:51.679> more<00:00:51.920> and<00:00:52.039> more

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:53.230 
it's just making it split more and more

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:56.020 
it's just making it split more and more
so<00:00:54.230> what<00:00:54.829> I<00:00:54.859> did<00:00:54.980> is<00:00:55.219> I<00:00:55.280> took<00:00:55.309> a<00:00:55.489> piece<00:00:55.760> of

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:56.030 
so what I did is I took a piece of

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:58.779 
so what I did is I took a piece of
aluminum<00:00:56.809> strap<00:00:57.170> 1<00:00:57.559> inch<00:00:57.739> aluminum<00:00:57.949> strap<00:00:58.489> I

00:00:58.779 --> 00:00:58.789 
aluminum strap 1 inch aluminum strap I

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:01.360 
aluminum strap 1 inch aluminum strap I
drilled<00:00:59.600> a<00:00:59.690> hole<00:00:59.719> in<00:01:00.170> it<00:01:00.289> just<00:01:00.589> big<00:01:00.829> enough<00:01:00.859> for

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:01.370 
drilled a hole in it just big enough for

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:03.459 
drilled a hole in it just big enough for
the<00:01:01.789> threaded<00:01:02.300> part<00:01:02.510> of<00:01:02.690> the<00:01:02.780> adjuster<00:01:03.230> to<00:01:03.350> go

00:01:03.459 --> 00:01:03.469 
the threaded part of the adjuster to go

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:07.870 
the threaded part of the adjuster to go
through<00:01:03.829> and<00:01:05.470> then<00:01:06.470> I<00:01:06.500> made<00:01:07.130> sure<00:01:07.160> it<00:01:07.430> lined<00:01:07.670> up

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:07.880 
through and then I made sure it lined up

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.570 
through and then I made sure it lined up
with<00:01:08.030> the<00:01:08.150> original<00:01:08.360> hole<00:01:08.840> and<00:01:09.550> then<00:01:10.550> I

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:10.580 
with the original hole and then I

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:13.060 
with the original hole and then I
drilled<00:01:10.940> a<00:01:11.030> couple<00:01:11.060> of<00:01:11.390> extra<00:01:11.780> holes<00:01:12.070> for

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:13.070 
drilled a couple of extra holes for

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:15.130 
drilled a couple of extra holes for
screws<00:01:13.370> to<00:01:13.730> go<00:01:13.850> in<00:01:14.060> just<00:01:14.300> to<00:01:14.390> give<00:01:14.510> it<00:01:14.600> to<00:01:14.780> some

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.140 
screws to go in just to give it to some

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:20.770 
screws to go in just to give it to some
more<00:01:15.290> support<00:01:18.280> and<00:01:19.280> also<00:01:20.240> be<00:01:20.570> sure<00:01:20.600> to

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:20.780 
more support and also be sure to

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.320 
more support and also be sure to
pre-drill<00:01:21.230> these<00:01:21.500> holes<00:01:21.790> because<00:01:22.790> this<00:01:23.060> wood

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:23.330 
pre-drill these holes because this wood

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:26.890 
pre-drill these holes because this wood
splits<00:01:23.690> were<00:01:23.870> really<00:01:24.110> easy<00:01:24.850> and<00:01:25.850> then<00:01:26.810> of

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:26.900 
splits were really easy and then of

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:28.840 
splits were really easy and then of
course<00:01:27.110> I<00:01:27.260> screwed<00:01:27.620> this<00:01:27.860> piece<00:01:28.220> of<00:01:28.400> aluminum

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:28.850 
course I screwed this piece of aluminum

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:32.410 
course I screwed this piece of aluminum
to<00:01:28.970> the<00:01:29.060> bottom<00:01:29.330> of<00:01:29.390> the<00:01:29.480> door<00:01:30.460> next<00:01:31.460> I<00:01:31.640> put<00:01:32.360> a

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:32.420 
to the bottom of the door next I put a

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.530 
to the bottom of the door next I put a
lock<00:01:32.660> nut<00:01:32.690> this<00:01:33.470> lug<00:01:33.680> nut<00:01:33.980> right<00:01:34.160> here<00:01:34.190> I<00:01:34.850> put

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:35.540 
lock nut this lug nut right here I put

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:40.120 
lock nut this lug nut right here I put
it<00:01:35.660> on<00:01:35.840> the<00:01:36.530> adjuster<00:01:37.070> and<00:01:37.930> just<00:01:38.930> ran<00:01:39.410> it<00:01:39.590> up<00:01:39.710> to

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 
it on the adjuster and just ran it up to

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.180 
it on the adjuster and just ran it up to
about<00:01:40.370> where<00:01:40.490> I<00:01:40.580> thought<00:01:40.760> it<00:01:40.820> needed<00:01:41.060> to<00:01:41.270> be

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:42.190 
about where I thought it needed to be

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:44.800 
about where I thought it needed to be
and<00:01:43.190> I<00:01:43.760> thought<00:01:44.000> this<00:01:44.180> would<00:01:44.360> wobble<00:01:44.720> around

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:44.810 
and I thought this would wobble around

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:46.540 
and I thought this would wobble around
pretty<00:01:45.200> bad<00:01:45.410> in<00:01:45.530> here<00:01:45.590> and<00:01:45.980> it<00:01:46.070> does<00:01:46.250> kind<00:01:46.460> of

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:46.550 
pretty bad in here and it does kind of

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:48.730 
pretty bad in here and it does kind of
wobble<00:01:46.910> but<00:01:47.090> it's<00:01:47.510> it<00:01:47.900> really<00:01:47.930> didn't<00:01:48.530> seem<00:01:48.650> to

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:48.740 
wobble but it's it really didn't seem to

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:50.410 
wobble but it's it really didn't seem to
be<00:01:48.860> a<00:01:48.890> big<00:01:49.100> deal<00:01:49.280> once<00:01:49.610> the<00:01:49.790> door<00:01:49.970> was<00:01:50.120> set<00:01:50.300> in

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420 
be a big deal once the door was set in

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.000 
be a big deal once the door was set in
place<00:01:50.630> it<00:01:50.900> didn't<00:01:51.170> you<00:01:51.470> know<00:01:51.500> open<00:01:51.890> and

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:52.010 
place it didn't you know open and

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.960 
place it didn't you know open and
shutting<00:01:52.190> the<00:01:52.310> door<00:01:52.460> it<00:01:52.580> didn't<00:01:52.790> move<00:01:52.910> very

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:52.970 
shutting the door it didn't move very

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:56.950 
shutting the door it didn't move very
much<00:01:53.330> at<00:01:53.510> all<00:01:53.680> so<00:01:54.680> you<00:01:55.580> know<00:01:55.670> it<00:01:56.210> really<00:01:56.450> wasn't

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960 
much at all so you know it really wasn't

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:30.930 
place adjusting it's a little bit
different<00:02:28.920> instead<00:02:29.920> of<00:02:30.130> lifting<00:02:30.430> the<00:02:30.670> door

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
different instead of lifting the door

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.540 
different instead of lifting the door
and<00:02:31.270> turning<00:02:31.660> the<00:02:32.050> pin<00:02:32.350> like<00:02:32.950> you<00:02:33.160> normally

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:33.550 
and turning the pin like you normally

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:37.199 
and turning the pin like you normally
would<00:02:34.020> you<00:02:35.020> don't<00:02:35.770> lift<00:02:36.130> the<00:02:36.430> door<00:02:36.580> you<00:02:37.180> just

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
reach under here with a pair of pliers

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:43.860 
reach under here with a pair of pliers
or<00:02:39.730> a<00:02:39.820> wrench<00:02:40.000> and<00:02:40.570> you<00:02:40.680> just<00:02:41.680> turn<00:02:42.670> this<00:02:42.910> turn

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
or a wrench and you just turn this turn

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:45.870 
or a wrench and you just turn this turn
this<00:02:44.020> lock<00:02:44.260> note<00:02:44.470> because<00:02:44.650> the<00:02:45.340> center<00:02:45.670> piece

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
this lock note because the center piece

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.030 
this lock note because the center piece
will<00:02:46.090> be<00:02:46.209> held<00:02:46.510> by<00:02:46.810> the<00:02:46.870> teeth<00:02:47.260> in<00:02:47.500> the<00:02:47.739> bottom

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.479 
will be held by the teeth in the bottom
track<00:02:48.310> and<00:02:49.440> it<00:02:50.440> was<00:02:50.560> really<00:02:50.709> a<00:02:50.800> lot<00:02:50.980> easier<00:02:51.310> to

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:51.489 
track and it was really a lot easier to

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:53.300 
track and it was really a lot easier to
adjust<00:02:51.610> than<00:02:52.000> I<00:02:52.090> thought<00:02:52.300> it<00:02:52.480> would<00:02:52.660> be<00:02:52.840> and

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
adjust than I thought it would be and

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:57.870 
adjust than I thought it would be and
that's<00:02:54.310> it<00:02:54.670> thanks<00:02:55.390> for<00:02:55.450> watching
