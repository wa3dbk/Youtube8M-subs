00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:48.079
 hi everyone guys are mysteries 95 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.059
 minutes in this new video today we are 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:53.809
 here with an action boxing man 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:01:00.079
 figures that I took from love you love like 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:01:04.430
 also the last to see from the leaflet of 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:08.659
 love you love that was inside the package 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:11.299
 this is the supersonic fig tree as you can 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:15.110
 see the panoramas first 

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:18.140
 main parts of the box as you can 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:20.030
 see also very large and indeed not 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:23.090
 it cost little the price as usual 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:25.340
 in a lasso in description was 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:28.850
 very well contained is the first is a 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:32.090
 movie just opened 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:35.509
 I can say that in a bag the packaging 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:38.810
 of everything because it was covered by a 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:41.299
 bag of veils of paper cartons e 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:43.159
 besides it was all covered by a kind 

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:45.979
 of tissue paper to keep it from getting 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:48.649
 the box that this beautiful summer 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:50.200
 so I would say to go and open the 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:53.549
 package 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.549
 our 2 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:28.190
 we finally did it was a 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:32.330
 little plastic then just opened if 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:35.420
 we obviously say sort of 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:38.410
 cardboard that previously in all 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:42.379
 action figure which is a kind of background 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:46.579
 then we find a Roman said that 

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:49.040
 we have to see there are no dates on 100 

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:52.160
 which in any case is rather a public 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:54.680
 static already mounted point will be 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:03:01.250
 very few pieces to assemble a first 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:03:05.359
 vb.ly headphones maybe or other small ones 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:08.660
 smallest details details that 

00:03:05.359 --> 00:03:11.150
 I'll explain later then let's go to 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:13.730
 open your attention before using 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:17.440
 transposed that shrewdness to the outside 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:17.440
 the large box 

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:30.530
 discovered by the usual 22 starters a lot 

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:37.099
 well 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:40.989
 we immediately find the very pretty phase with 

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:40.989
 the supersonic logo 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:45.540
 Yup 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:52.769
 is 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:56.220
 now let's go stay the daughter who 

00:03:52.769 --> 00:04:02.519
 I'll have to live, I know to remove the 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:05.400
 we go to the plastic yet another is known 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:07.560
 head what i hate because to overturn 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:12.170
 very very much 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:15.450
 otherwise we take for the perfect 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:18.750
 this is launch a figuro mind already 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:22.860
 mounted and high should be high 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:26.610
 practically on 30 33 cm i 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:31.050
 details are wonderful and passed a lot 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:32.940
 well the details I wanted to say 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:37.080
 experimented while going to mount it 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:39.630
 darkened base ok then the details that 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:43.770
 I wanted to first are that practically in 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:47.699
 theory this tufts sibiu the piece 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:49.350
 above we say the removable bra 

00:04:47.699 --> 00:04:52.380
 in the video I wo n't let you see that 

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:55.430
 anyway apart from that I don't like them 

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:58.400
 a lot of the features that have this 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:05:02.160
 feature this feature here 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:03.630
 then because I don't know what it could anyway 

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:07.620
 happening notice you could anyway 

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:08.099
 be restricted by copy and by various 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:11.070
 people 

00:05:08.099 --> 00:05:12.780
 so nothing see you at the end of 

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:14.940
 video with the latest panoramas of the 

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:17.690
 figure and challenge next won in the 

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:17.690
 our warm foot 

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:23.560
 for the barrels 

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:26.360
 the
