00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 hola amigos como estan moteros I'm in 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.750
 ti panji as you know this week 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.970
 all if you are also participating 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.250
 in the campaign no more murderous holes to 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.139
 national level this campaign consists of 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.210
 to mark the gaps that you see in the 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.949
 Street with spray of a visible color 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.609
 like the photos that I 'm going to show you 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.609
 continuation 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:22.960
 do not 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:45.100
 I've heard that people are 

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:48.670
 saying that what we try to 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:51.430
 to do is vandalism but I think that 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:53.560
 heart the person most bandana is the one 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:55.780
 does not care for the lives of others 

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:57.820
 We are trying because it is not 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:00.610
 let's say the best way to do it then 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:02.710
 because we do not have resources, let's say 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:04.150
 I could then you could the 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:07.330
 they would all cover to save others 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:09.070
 friends material but it's an initiative 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:10.570
 it's not vandalism because I 'm 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:12.850
 trying to save a person who does not 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:14.650
 I know is more going to give the person 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:16.479
 that does not cover them and steals the money that 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:18.369
 we pay in taxes and come 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:20.350
 all those things when you see a hole 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:23.229
 and you know you're going to fall into it 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:25.090
 dangerous the entrance and hollow the hole 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:27.250
 as such and the exit from the hole 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:29.170
 Here I am going to show you this image is 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:30.940
 perfect to be able to explain all 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:32.680
 the dangers that await us in a hole 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:34.869
 whenever we see a gap our 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:36.430
 survival reaction is to slow down and 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:38.380
 as we get scared we do it from a 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:40.000
 rough way if you have not seen the video 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:42.009
 of survival reactions I'll 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.320
 I leave here to the side in a link if you took 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:44.950
 the gap now the danger will be to leave 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.630
 the 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:47.650
 Many people tend to celebrate just 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:50.020
 comes out of the hole 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:51.940
 guess that after the gap is 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:54.520
 full of dirt and dirt so it 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:56.740
 They accelerate hard can slip and fall there 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.330
 two different types of holes those that 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.460
 they look and those who do not look 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:02.650
 that is to say the hole that is at the bottom 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:04.900
 you can see that it is not deep and maybe 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:07.390
 not dangerous but if you can see the 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:09.160
 first hole has water and probably 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:10.450
 be the same as the one behind or have two 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.890
 meters deep 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:13.780
 remember that apart from the holes 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:16.060
 we have a very important subject that are 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:18.670
 the types of liquids how to recognize 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.650
 gasoline oil acpm or water in the 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.090
 floor if you want me to make a video with 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:22.690
 this topic let me know in the 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:25.390
 comments 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:27.250
 this is also super dangerous I 'm going 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:30.520
 further tell what it is the 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:32.350
 campaign and what you have to 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:34.540
 to do is buy a green spray 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:36.220
 yellow or pink of a color that looks 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.020
 even out there reading comment 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:41.230
 this the white color is more noticeable and 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:43.630
 when you see a hollow curled culvert 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:45.580
 unevenness whatever you put in 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:48.310
 risk our life you should mark it 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:50.200
 in order to mitigate the risk of 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:51.490
 all motorcyclists as they have 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:54.069
 told to the people who have attended 

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:56.469
 lectures I always leave a task 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:58.510
 and it is of being a collaborator of being a 

00:02:56.469 --> 00:03:01.749
 best person whenever we 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:03.579
 we shoot we use the demarcations with the 

00:03:01.749 --> 00:03:05.650
 feet is to say if there is a gap or a 

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:07.689
 obstacle the right hand one pulls the 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.340
 right foot and the brand or if it is at 

00:03:07.689 --> 00:03:11.680
 otherwise left to the left we 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:13.510
 Take out your foot and brand it but we 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.859
 we are used to doing it when 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:17.290
 we are shooting with our friends 

00:03:14.859 --> 00:03:19.060
 family but we do not realize that 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:20.650
 If we can do it daily, we can 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:22.810
 also save the lives of many bikers 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:24.489
 so for everyone who is watching 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:26.019
 this video for everyone who is 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:27.939
 behind this computer or that 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:29.709
 cell gave them the task of being 

00:03:27.939 --> 00:03:32.230
 more aware that this is a 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:34.030
 super giant problem for us that 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:36.939
 in hollow for a karra means a ring 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:39.069
 but for a biker it means an arm or 

00:03:36.939 --> 00:03:40.900
 a leg and until life I hope that 

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:42.579
 They liked it very much that they love each other 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.439
 join this nice campaign 

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:46.719
 remember that it continues to mark hollow me 

00:03:44.439 --> 00:03:49.299
 You can send the photo to my facebook or to 

00:03:46.719 --> 00:03:51.819
