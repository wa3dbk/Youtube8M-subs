00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 but with the idea that drinking milk 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:06.420
 then say breastfeeding 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:08.490
 throughout the adulthood it is 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.330
 something tremendously beneficial that you 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:14.130
 affirms calcium 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:16.619
 exactly however to ten years of 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.330
 study are many listened well many 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.939
 the experts who have joined 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.439
 say that the control of the consumption of 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.350
 milk has to be completely 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.580
 restricted because the amount of 

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:28.439
 atrocities that the body causes can 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.160
 be beyond suspicion we have no 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.160
 let's have 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.240
 milk and its derivatives are part of 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.580
 our daily diet but you have to have 

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:49.500
 caution since experts and studies 

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:52.620
 ensure that this product should only 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.930
 be consumed in breastfeeding and 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.440
 that could otherwise bring more than 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.440
 A concern 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.670
 man is the only mammal that 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:07.980
 after breastfeeding follow 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.590
 drinking milk the chief investigator and 

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:12.660
 Holly of the University of Bristol Kingdom 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.280
 united ensures that the milk has been 

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:16.020
 designed during the evolution of the 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.940
 mammals like food 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.430
 essential for growth and 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:22.320
 particularly to cover the period 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.540
 of time between birth and 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.700
 maturation of the digestive system more 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.610
 late it is not desirable that the tissues of the 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:32.460
 organism grow quickly because in 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:35.070
 this case a cancer occurs then 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.180
 because being an adult is not good to take 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.570
 milk 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:42.940
 it was a systemic reaction in the sense 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:45.550
 which is breathing problems problems 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:48.250
 of skin that is vomiting and that may cause 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:50.830
 death to problems that would be an extreme 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:53.140
 what we call anaphylaxis or 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:57.820
 we can three pictures of digestive type 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:02:00.820
 of type of skin type or any 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:02.920
 organ may be affected the period 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.390
 of breastfeeding for babies is of sum 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.770
 importance in the development of the child 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:08.229
 but eye 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:10.360
 Maman Carlos is recommended until two 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:13.260
 years of life what is the importance of 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.260
 breastfeeding period 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.390
 let's say mom's milk is ready 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:21.090
 for all the needs of the son 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:24.069
 covers all your needs in one 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:26.379
 fully balanced composition 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:29.230
 the cow's milk that we consume daily 

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:31.120
 It can be a real problem as experts 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:34.269
 they assure that it would cause cease 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.980
 diseases can not logically 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:39.040
 to miss that more and more experts do 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:41.230
 his voice openly claiming that the 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.060
 milk and its derivatives not only that are not 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:45.280
 food suitable for the human being 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:48.159
 but they do not even constitute a 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:50.200
 good source of calcium the academy 

00:02:48.159 --> 00:02:52.239
 American pediatric department ensures that 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:54.579
 children under one year can not 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:57.280
 digest cow's milk for its high 

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:59.349
 sodium and potassium protein content already 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.900
 that your body does not have the maturity to 

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:03.609
 handle them still the levels of 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:06.219
 protein and these minerals in the 

00:03:03.609 --> 00:03:08.349
 cow's milk are too high for 

00:03:06.219 --> 00:03:11.109
 that the baby's kidneys can 

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:15.480
 driving can also irritate the stomach 

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:18.010
 and cause animal milk anemia 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:20.290
 demineralized to adults that is 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:22.480
 it was found that women who do not 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:24.879
 they took cow's milk and its only 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:27.219
 food was the rice the vegetables the 

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:29.830
 leaves their derivatives did not suffer 

00:03:27.219 --> 00:03:31.840
 osteoporosis and yet 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:34.060
 introduced cow's milk into the diet 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:37.330
 their calcium levels dropped and 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:39.160
 increased the cases of osteoporosis of 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:41.320
 according to the school of public health of 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:43.180
 harvard the most recommended in the 

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:45.490
 diet is the equivalent of 2 glasses of 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:47.590
 milk a day and suggest getting the rest 

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:50.010
 of calcium that is needed from other 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:52.560
 sources 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:54.420
 but the body is not prepared to 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:58.019
 prepare to feed yourself with done to 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:59.670
 cow that has been because in many 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:01.799
 opportunities the mother can not advance 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:04.099
 his children in the first substitute and the 

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:07.319
 first substitute is cow's milk 

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:09.329
 to be able to feed children is the 

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:10.440
 importance of breast milk and 

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:12.180
 breastfeeding period 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:14.790
 but the worry because some 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:16.350
 international studies ensure that 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:18.600
 keep feeding the human being with 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:22.880
 cow's milk for the rest of the years 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:22.880
 It can be a latent danger
