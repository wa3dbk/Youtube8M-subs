00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:26.279

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.750
 that it does not come on the board of what 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.880
 why the hell did she not come goat obviously 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.790

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:38.040
 come to life at night and they hide yours 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.899
 body in costumes so maybe she 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.730
 I heard that in this pizzeria were 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.219
 some kind of children's incidents 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.860
 killed and after that their bodies were 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:49.260
 found in costumes does not resemble years 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.510
 does she tell you anything about rumors 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.420
 who walk around this pizzeria a 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.850
 more precisely around the whole franchise in fnaf 2 o 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.430
 similar rumors also mentions fugue 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.829
 i want you to forget about everything that you 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.320
 heard earlier about pizzeria yes i know 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:07.200
 some of us have a bad opinion of it all 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.390
 just rumors but it's not all on 3 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.790
 at night the word says a and before i 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.340
 I leave I'm saying that all the rumors about which you 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.740
 heard earlier they well you know no more than 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.590
 the usual horror stories for the night here are the ball 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.479
 worry well yes yes yes background guy they 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.939
 mean nothing 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:26.280
 girl in fnaf 4 shows that on 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:28.979
 actually talk about these pizzerias 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:32.100
 people don't votre auditing awaken at night 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:34.979
 kill people of course these rumors 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:37.409
 appeared not from scratch someone killed 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.390
 in one of the pizzerias their kids hid in 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.790
 costumes and after that talk about it 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.619
 people i guess it happened yet 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.479
 in a restaurant before fnaf2 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.670
 in the very one that was once 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.530
 abandoned and now i want you 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.979
 remembered what I said in previous 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.229
 video 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:54.570
 Especially in this the fact is that the restaurant 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.829
 and dream 4 works at the same time as 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.079
 dream restaurants 2 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:59.969
 well or at least almost the same 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:02.520
 time we can assume it on 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:04.829
 the basis of many facts the example of toy 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.920
 that animatronics and excuse me for 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:10.560
 a tautology and of course a brazier a brazier 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.420
 is that foxy like you all know about 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.580
 This said background Guy Baff us 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:17.340
 and also background guy during fnaf 2 said something 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:20.069
 and animatronics created specifically for 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:22.260
 restaurant from fnaf 2 and that means something 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:24.750
 animatronics did not exist until 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.819
 there was a restaurant of us two but in 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.230
 fnaf 4 that there is toy 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:30.450
 animatronics and mangle 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:33.000
 and all these mystery sailors are not from 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:35.489
 fredber friends there do not have neither the Mongol 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.400
 that animatronics and also chika chika 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:41.400
 freddie ran friends is fat while 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:43.230
 chika toy chika toy thin 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:46.230
 now back to the girl who 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:48.870
 lasted living animatronics from 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.549
 the fact that rumors that someone died in 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.730
 these stories about what they were 

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:56.100
 stuck in a suit there means that 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:58.380
 already actually these killings occurred 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:01.680
 and we only know about one event 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:04.200
 surely the event that is described yet 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:07.080
 fishing on off 1 is the same newspaper 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:09.750
 back in the days of fnaf2 we assumed that 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:11.760
 all these events are associated with 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:13.709
 a restaurant that was doubled 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.310
 abandoned and it was abandoned precisely because 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:16.530
 of this 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:19.140
 technically, we are now confirming the old 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:21.390
 the theory that is the story such someone killed 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:22.890
 kids in an old restaurant after that 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:25.549
 these children got into animatronic suits 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:28.739
 then they were somehow discovered and 

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:30.810
 the restaurant closed afterwards 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:33.720
 many many years restaurant perry 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:36.420
 opens but rumors still haunt 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:38.370
 this franchise again on all these facts I 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:39.900
 I assume that the killings were before 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:41.940
 fnaf4 fnaf2 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:43.680
 and they were in the restaurant where we still 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:45.570
 have never been by the way there 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:48.000
 guess what exactly is the restaurant 

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:50.489
 which was once abandoned is 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.620
 fredber in france such a case myself 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:54.329
 TV takes on important meaning he 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:56.519
 shows when actually 

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:59.600
 there was a restaurant with the first five 

00:03:56.519 --> 00:04:02.760
 killing under the restaurant existed in 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:04.380
 1983 so yes it could be closed and to 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:06.720
 moment 87 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:09.890
 he will be just the source 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.890
 rumors for kids
