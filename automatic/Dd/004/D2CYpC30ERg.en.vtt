previews of the apps so like where I was
in<00:02:11.620> the<00:02:11.709> settings<00:02:12.069> it<00:02:12.519> shows<00:02:12.909> it<00:02:13.150> right<00:02:13.599> here

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
in the settings it shows it right here

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.860 
in the settings it shows it right here
on<00:02:13.900> the<00:02:14.230> on<00:02:14.409> the<00:02:14.920> little<00:02:15.159> settings<00:02:15.549> on<00:02:16.240> app

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870

dimensions<00:02:19.000> of<00:02:19.120> your<00:02:19.270> iPod<00:02:19.599> so<00:02:20.080> it<00:02:20.290> I<00:02:20.500> think

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
dimensions of your iPod so it I think

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:21.070

just like that

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:00.490 
just like that
OOP<00:02:59.090> they're<00:02:59.360> gone<00:02:59.510> and<00:02:59.720> if<00:03:00.170> you<00:03:00.260> want<00:03:00.410> to

OOP they're gone and if you want to
close<00:03:00.620> all<00:03:00.860> of<00:03:00.890> them<00:03:01.100> at<00:03:01.160> once<00:03:01.459> just<00:03:01.790> hold<00:03:02.000> down

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150 
close all of them at once just hold down

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:04.030 
close all of them at once just hold down
on<00:03:02.330> an<00:03:02.420> app<00:03:02.570> and<00:03:02.900> that<00:03:03.050> will<00:03:03.140> give<00:03:03.260> you<00:03:03.440> it'll

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
on an app and that will give you it'll

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:05.140 
on an app and that will give you it'll
ask<00:03:04.160> you<00:03:04.370> if<00:03:04.459> you'd<00:03:04.550> like<00:03:04.640> to<00:03:04.760> close<00:03:04.910> all<00:03:05.060> the

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
ask you if you'd like to close all the

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:09.040 
ask you if you'd like to close all the
apps<00:03:05.300> we<00:03:05.540> say<00:03:05.690> yes<00:03:05.900> and<00:03:07.630> they<00:03:08.630> all<00:03:08.780> go<00:03:08.959> away

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:09.050 
apps we say yes and they all go away

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:11.830 
apps we say yes and they all go away
then<00:03:09.350> so<00:03:10.070> that<00:03:10.100> is<00:03:10.490> basically<00:03:10.700> how<00:03:11.150> Excel

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
then so that is basically how Excel

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:13.960 
then so that is basically how Excel
works<00:03:12.050> it's<00:03:12.560> a<00:03:12.680> very<00:03:12.950> very<00:03:13.220> nice<00:03:13.370> tweak<00:03:13.670> I<00:03:13.790> like

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:13.970 
works it's a very very nice tweak I like

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:15.400 
works it's a very very nice tweak I like
it's<00:03:14.180> it's<00:03:14.420> a<00:03:14.510> really<00:03:14.720> good<00:03:14.870> way<00:03:14.990> to<00:03:15.020> spice<00:03:15.380> it

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.410 
it's it's a really good way to spice it

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:17.320 
it's it's a really good way to spice it
up<00:03:15.740> it<00:03:16.070> doesn't<00:03:16.340> use<00:03:16.490> that<00:03:16.520> he<00:03:16.940> doesn't<00:03:17.209> use<00:03:17.300> a

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:17.330 
up it doesn't use that he doesn't use a

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:20.020 
up it doesn't use that he doesn't use a
ton<00:03:17.600> of<00:03:17.630> RAM<00:03:17.959> so<00:03:18.500> it'll<00:03:18.770> be<00:03:18.890> good<00:03:19.010> for<00:03:19.280> like

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030 
ton of RAM so it'll be good for like

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:22.540 
ton of RAM so it'll be good for like
fourth<00:03:20.930> generation<00:03:21.440> iPhones<00:03:21.920> and<00:03:22.250> iPod
