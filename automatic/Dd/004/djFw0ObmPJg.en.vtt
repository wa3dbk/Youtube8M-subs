00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:10.610
 Hello my dear, today 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:14.269
 continue with Christmas preparations 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:17.820
 in the middle of august, the topic liqueur and 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:19.830
 I would like to liqueur myself today 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.730
 I have made a claimant lee curtis 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:25.410
 a little herb witch and sage is 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:27.300
 usually a winter thing just for 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:31.020
 inflammations so I took notes 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:33.000
 with gingivitis throat neck 

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:35.730
 I am there , but I know the ointment 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.079
 sweets that is a good thing is around 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.960
 also inflammation degrees by the 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:42.030
 It is essential to relieve essential oils 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.030
 but also helps in the digestive tract 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.890
 speak in case of diarrhea with blockages 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.960
 and to balance again 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.970
 and I 've got it myself 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.670
 made of mine is always new soft 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:54.810
 pack here you see him as you see he 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.420
 is pretty big 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:59.760
 I have different varieties I take 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:03.540
 quite like the because very large leaves 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:05.129
 has also consulting bocker there has 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:08.280
 you also do not have a sheet with you 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:10.500
 too strong and I have everything already 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.840
 prepared what we needed for a correct 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:16.710
 good league need what we especially 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:19.350
 need and that is only since that is called 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.749
 We even see today on the Edit 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.700
 whole one week in a year one 

00:01:21.749 --> 00:01:25.439
 good for weeks until he in a month 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.119
 itself needs a little time to 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.340
 pull 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:32.429
 he actually needs as a ground substance 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:36.119
 First only the sage leaves that is 

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:38.069
 a good handful of aromatic sage 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:41.609
 smells please in advance whether it is also the 

00:01:38.069 --> 00:01:46.619
 have sense of smell want everyone likes 

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:50.819
 but I think it's great and 1 liter of alcohol 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:53.670
 say 37 38 percent better 40 42 

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:55.439
 I take the kindergarten choir 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:59.130
 prefers to find the word 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:00.899
 Neutral and gentle and grain I think 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:04.499
 my direction is just too easy for me 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:07.409
 hard and that's why I am in favor 

00:02:04.499 --> 00:02:09.270
 decided that's the basic ingredients 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:11.060
 that you need and I will soon 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.620
 let's go and then we will continue 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:16.319
 as we put the whole to a 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:19.049
 moment that looks like this 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:21.120
 is the same as I said that me 

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:21.569
 I have a good handful too 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.489
 here 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:24.810
 I took different ones 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:28.709
 i said i have the little mini 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:30.629
 taken as you can see but I have too 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:32.819
 my big room was one 

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:36.870
 even silver sage taken away 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:38.519
 The big salad fits is actually 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.219
 a simple story i agree 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:44.760
 let the gentleman see it again 

00:02:41.219 --> 00:02:46.950
 really just take the leaves like 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:49.709
 It s best here so you take the 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:51.359
 leaves and just start fresh 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:54.359
 of course they should be washed 

00:02:51.359 --> 00:02:57.419
 she is on the camp and lays her down 

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:59.669
 and so I gave myself one 

00:02:57.419 --> 00:03:02.849
 but that recovers from it 

00:02:59.669 --> 00:03:04.889
 please do not tear off your heads otherwise 

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:06.389
 he does not grow anymore and it would be 

00:03:04.889 --> 00:03:08.699
 but that's a pity 

00:03:06.389 --> 00:03:12.209
 All what happened to the room was missing 

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:16.680
 can at the moment does not need the 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:19.680
 tenant to the recipe is one can the 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:22.859
 battle so I do not do it 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:25.409
 I like you so much 

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:27.030
 she'll strap it on with her 

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:30.120
 really to the essential oils the 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:35.509
 they are still getting along with them 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:35.509
 not squeezing cut very important 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:45.540
 So really just take it around 

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:46.459
 ok really take it all over and the 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:50.370
 smell 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:51.959
 it just smells so i like it 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:53.220
 clean is not everyone's thing so 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:57.509
 you just have to like it or you have to 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:59.069
 test if you like it roughly divide her 

00:03:57.509 --> 00:04:00.810
 Lord does not have to go into the subtleties 

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:03.000
 the bet was later from 7 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:06.509
 then you really take it all in 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:09.629
 hand purely in the glass I'm here 

00:04:06.509 --> 00:04:12.870
 liter jar a bequest is that there was 

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:15.539
 in this for 142 and is one 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:18.570
 Ordinary anyway, the whole thing is enough 

00:04:15.539 --> 00:04:22.049
 you see about now still in the 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:25.260
 really go for the third quarter 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:33.270
 fill with alcohol I said I've got 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:34.020
 here a vodka I need one more 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:38.300
 a little bit more 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:38.300
 that's half a liter now 

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:59.610
 that wheat argo with 40 percent like you 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:05:01.979
 See that should have been the whole thing 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:04.789
 load it now really stand out you have to 

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:08.039
 really close it off now 

00:05:04.789 --> 00:05:11.520
 close well with the rubber around it 

00:05:08.039 --> 00:05:14.909
 make the whole thing tight and really 

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:17.820
 pull a month at room temperature 

00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:22.229
 and very important after that 

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:24.180
 Whole please with 400 grams of honey or 

00:05:22.229 --> 00:05:25.919
 kandis or chronic can be 

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:27.510
 mixed as you like 

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:30.690
 suspend what your tastes 

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:33.360
 is intervene and then please again 

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:35.550
 two months and then pull off 

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:37.699
 filter what you do however 

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:41.039
 you should shake it more often 

00:05:37.699 --> 00:05:46.469
 but we also know that as well 

00:05:41.039 --> 00:05:48.510
 just to make sure that yourself 

00:05:46.469 --> 00:05:51.810
 distribute the essential oils well in the 

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:53.699
 So time and time again I ask 

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:56.460
 the kitchen with purely there already for 

00:05:53.699 --> 00:05:58.650
 really darken from 7 

00:05:56.460 --> 00:06:00.389
 by shaking it all up too 

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:03.389
 really a good aroma comes from outside and 

00:06:00.389 --> 00:06:05.430
 as I said after about four weeks 

00:06:03.389 --> 00:06:07.740
 Eight sweet as long should be there 

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:08.789
 Eigen taste possibilities have become 

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:12.240
 to unfold 

00:06:08.789 --> 00:06:14.270
 cushion after 23 months and then completely 

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:16.949
 important to store dark because that's not him 

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:18.779
 say nothing in the saga leaves there is nothing left 

00:06:16.949 --> 00:06:20.729
 in there he has to stand really dark 

00:06:18.779 --> 00:06:24.270
 I'll write you the recipe again 

00:06:20.729 --> 00:06:26.969
 like to down in the infobox with pure and 

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:28.259
 make the next liqueurs because that was 

00:06:26.969 --> 00:06:28.830
 yes, not all, he is only one 

00:06:28.259 --> 00:06:30.729
 Beginning 

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:33.099
 and as I said, I think so 

00:06:30.729 --> 00:06:35.740
 The tail likes to be present as a little in 

00:06:33.099 --> 00:06:37.120
 the Christmas time because everyone knew 

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:39.819
 sore throat and that's a good one 

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:41.529
 thing good if you still have questions like 

00:06:39.819 --> 00:06:44.680
 I like to say I'm a little one 

00:06:41.529 --> 00:06:46.870
