00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
this is a bit of a home tunnel to the

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.570 
this is a bit of a home tunnel to the
castles<00:01:24.810> here<00:01:25.080> are<00:01:25.320> far<00:01:25.680> more<00:01:25.710> beautiful<00:01:26.189> than

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:34.039 
castles here are far more beautiful than
once<00:01:27.450> upon<00:01:27.720> a<00:01:27.750> time<00:01:30.590> or<00:01:31.590> ochres<00:01:32.810> but<00:01:33.810> we<00:01:33.900> might

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
once upon a time or ochres but we might

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:35.569
