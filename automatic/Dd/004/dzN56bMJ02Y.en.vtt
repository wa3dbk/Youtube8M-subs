00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 and hi everyone today we get 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:06.240
 found for a new video where I 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:09.179
 will introduce you to two small designs 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.700
 to make disc traps so the 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.380
 records began getting is remembered 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.500
 it supports martin creepers is killed by 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.850
 an archer so he absolutely has to 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.560
 in the same axis so that the 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.949
 creeper get killed last 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.029
 arrow 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:25.560
 it must kill the creeper so you 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.109
 arrive at night you have your trap 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:33.420
 install you have a scared cry that 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:34.950
 get off hop I put the car 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.059
 we will go get it where to go 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:40.590
 look for this one I take the creeper 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:41.670
 I bring it to me you do not have to 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.399
 not get too far for paquinou 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.280
 loss of sight I put myself on the other side 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:49.050
 from the trap he tried to come to me 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.430
 and he will rush into the trap so 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.930
 once it is mounted on the tab 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.030
 pressure you have 4 pistons that are 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.350
 mounted to block it and bones half 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.230
 souls but it can be blocks for 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.539
 just stop him from running away to 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.070
 not that they jump over 

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:04.170
 so you can place blocks but the 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.600
 benefit of migdal end of the talent is 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.580
 nothing arises over and I'll 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.930
 take the skeleton that is here and I 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.600
 I'm going to do the same, I'm going to 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:15.720
 the pulls and hop I do the con tour for 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.490
 pat the creeper explodes and I'm going to 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.869
 pass in the second part of 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.460
 trap 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:21.869
 that's it and your trap is installed and 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.750
 all you have to do is you 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:27.330
 place here and lick trying to 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:30.420
 kill you is actually going to be the creeper 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:33.079
 simply an example to stretching 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.220
 above you must not go too far 

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:37.290
 here it is to wear and 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.460
 attacking me he attacks the creeper so 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.850
 to go faster than you can 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:45.860
 to do is to touch the creeper before 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:47.909
 attacked the creeper and for whom he remains 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:49.259
 a little less life is like that 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:53.070
 the larcher will only have to finish the 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:54.960
 creeper up was going again I think it 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:59.430
 but five or something like that if 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:01.290
 you do not touch before that 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:04.469
 clipper my lug and a little say that 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:06.540
 I will recover and that's it and it's 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:07.740
 settled and a little technique what 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.539
 you can do either you kill the 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.220
 skeleton and bring you to another cry 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.250
 scare etc and you start again like that one 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.740
 always 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.060
 by bringing the creeper first or you 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:19.930
 can just close this 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.950
 part here and there the skeleton do not want 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.900
 attack you as long as you're not 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.870
 here is where I can go 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:27.070
 another scream then scare vam 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.320
 attack when I go through there 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:31.180
 but logically if you have armor 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:33.370
 to do that should it should go 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:34.840
 so I show you this again 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.830
 I can place the clippers and for 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.650
 to go faster I will even attack the 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:41.160
 creep so it seems to me that these three 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:44.680
 sword strokes make it so one last 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:47.620
 this is normally laval laval the 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:51.790
 kill in one go this time so 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:54.850
 I put myself here the active creeper the 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:57.400
 plate I place myself there and the arrow the 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:59.260
 will crust and that's it and you do not have 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.060
 more than pick up the disc I you 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.590
 show it suddenly I go creative 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:06.010
 on a map with a little more 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:08.110
 light to show you this I'm here 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:09.970
 on a brand new superflate for 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:11.910
 show you this little design so very 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:16.680
 simple to build you have the place 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:19.269
 where the modes will land you put here 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:21.310
 dollar and stone above a block with 

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:23.650
 a plaque that will attract blow that will 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:26.950
 activate everything around and everything 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:32.680
 around on the 4 you put a piston 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:34.600
 sticking a city and unblocks once 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.700
 I come in the middle here is the trap is 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:39.790
 activated so here you add some 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:42.850
 barriers for the mob to escape 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:47.829
 not hop a little bit of distance between 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:54.910
 both so that the trap will not be active 

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:58.680
 and not the same here same all 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:04:04.360
 it's dug and we put udder on 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:06.160
 unlock the red stone block and that's it 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:07.510
 the trick is played and both are 

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:09.640
 activated now what it takes is 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:11.350
 just cover above with nominal 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:17.729
 and for that nothing more simple 

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:21.609
 hop same thing here we add 

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:24.569
 a tonsil here a dominate there we do 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:30.849
 a little cross and it's settled 

00:04:24.569 --> 00:04:32.470
 hop and that's my trap is over so 

00:04:30.849 --> 00:04:35.319
 it's very simple to build you have 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:37.750
 need in all 2 8 pistons sticking the 

00:04:35.319 --> 00:04:41.560
 rest of redstone and some blocks 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:43.720
 that's not harder than that and do not forget 

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:45.819
 not once the skeleton is in 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:50.080
 you can close his sides the 

00:04:45.819 --> 00:04:53.560
 adding blocks here I'm going to you 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:56.830
 show a little second design and I 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:59.919
 ended with that so that's the second 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:01.660
 well known design much less expensive 

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:03.880
 since 0 redstone 

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:06.970
 in fact we use barriers and 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:08.889
 the soul cndd why soul scene 

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:12.370
 because apparently the soul stand is 

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:15.099
 a little bit lower than a 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:16.750
 normal block actually and like the most 

00:05:15.099 --> 00:05:19.569
 low and the barrier is higher 

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:20.470
 that a normal block at the moment where the 

00:05:19.569 --> 00:05:22.509
 the fashions go here 

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:24.550
 see that there if I move forward I am 

00:05:22.509 --> 00:05:26.050
 completely blocked forced to jump 

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:27.759
 except that they do not detect that there is 

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:30.220
 a block they have they feel they have 

00:05:27.759 --> 00:05:32.380
 no need to actually jump and result 

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:34.330
 they advance they follow you and they 

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:35.590
 are stuck and charges and to escape 

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:37.599
 like that but they are completely 

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:40.150
 blocked so I can show you with 

00:05:37.599 --> 00:05:41.500
 a grip hours and it remains the same 

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:42.969
 principle ie never first a 

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:46.330
 scream then scares an archer and got 

00:05:42.969 --> 00:05:47.710
 lured from behind me without skipping our 

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:49.000
 keys glitch a little through the sand 

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:49.210
 but it's still good here we go the 

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.639
 see 

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:54.039
 here and see that even if I turn 

00:05:51.639 --> 00:05:56.050
 around he's not going to jump to arrive 

00:05:54.039 --> 00:05:58.120
 to me so it is completely blocked 

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:59.050
 you just have to bring back a market of 

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:01.599
 the same way as earlier 

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:03.729
 larcher are here and you 

00:06:01.599 --> 00:06:07.060
 line up here for the archer to attack the 

00:06:03.729 --> 00:06:08.349
 skeleton that's hop we bring back a little 

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:09.969
 little I find it a little bit 

00:06:08.349 --> 00:06:12.699
 less safe because here are the words 

00:06:09.969 --> 00:06:14.770
 can jump I find it a little less 

00:06:12.699 --> 00:06:17.289
 saïfi that the other advantage is that it 

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:19.380
 is especially not at all expensive it costs 

00:06:17.289 --> 00:06:22.990
 nothing at all the big advantage 

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:24.969
 so that's all for this video 

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:26.680
 if it has pleased you do not hesitate to 

00:06:24.969 --> 00:06:28.089
 put 1 blue thumbs and I I you 

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:30.659
 find for the next 

00:06:28.089 --> 00:06:30.659
 bye
