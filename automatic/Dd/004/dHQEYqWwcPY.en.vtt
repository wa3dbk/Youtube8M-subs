00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:05.500
 Welcome once again to android mobile 

00:00:02.679 --> 00:00:07.420
 and if you want to see full hd everything 

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:10.560
 the new nexus 5 offers you I invite you to 

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:10.560
 that you stay with the video 

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:24.370
 the most logical when buying the lexus 5 and 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:26.170
 have in your hand will see your great 

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:31.210
 screen and its dimensions that 

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:32.529
 exactly they are 137 9 x 69 2 by 8 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:34.210
 6 mm points 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:37.239
 the truth is that all this is very well 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:41.010
 because everything is incorporated in a weight 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:41.010
 of only 130 grams 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:45.730
 another of the first things we will do 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:48.190
 when we have one of those five in your hand 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:48.760
 will be touching it in this aspect in this 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.820
 pulled apart 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:54.280
 really in those five has managed to have 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:56.289
 a great feeling at hand in addition to 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:59.110
 which is made with a series of plastic 

00:00:56.289 --> 00:01:01.390
 or mosso that by holding it in the hand 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:02.979
 would fall and it feels very good in the 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:04.580
 hand also includes your weight I want 

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:06.980
 give you light 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:09.200
 also aesthetically have the buttons 

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:11.390
 Power down Shutdown rise 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.790
 of volume with a material called 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:15.500
 pottery something that gives you a 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:18.320
 feel much more premium up in a 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:21.260
 nexus 5 but after having it 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:23.750
 flirtatious seen taking pictures of him and seeing him 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:25.730
 from any possible angle, it's time to throw him 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.680
 a look inside what brings us and 

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:30.890
 what holds for us are made 5 that 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:33.110
 would be android pure android 4.4 kitkat 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:34.760
 with what all that entails the truth 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.040
 is that in the software that is this new 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:40.100
 alternative operating system the new 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:42.080
 the new application that is the 4.4 us 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.890
 depara with greater integration of 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:48.560
 google now since later you 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:50.750
 I will teach how to click on settings we 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.970
 it will appear that we can choose or not 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:55.870
 this will increase us google now by doing 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:58.420
 scrolling home screens 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:02:00.490
 and it makes the whole terminal work from 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.630
 a very fast and simple way I think 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:04.270
 that also has to be a little 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:06.970
 implemented its processor since it has 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:09.790
 a quad core snapdragon 802 with 3 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:11.530
 gigahertz this is the most reward you 

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:12.430
 You can find a friend in the market and 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.370
 how not 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:17.080
 nexus is going to bring this to market 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.960
 above it means that he incorporates 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:22.000
 pure android you will be able to be opening 

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:23.710
 and closing applications that you give the 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.020
 win and in no time you will find 

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:28.780
 a little old this in my opinion is 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:31.090
 something that we should give a point 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:33.640
 positive although it is also due to the 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:35.890
 positive point or negative one that comes 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.060
 on the screen as it is subtracted 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:39.100
 0 with 3 inches 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:41.110
 by not having a built-in keypad in 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:43.180
 the frames but it has to be 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:44.710
 always included in what is the 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:47.850
 screen and this remains you think you do not 

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:47.850
 useful screens 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:55.390
 and a resolution 1920 x 1080 full hd a 

00:02:53.829 --> 00:02:57.670
 of the best screens I've seen 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:59.530
 comparing it with what is right now 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:01.840
 in the market since there are terminals 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:02.859
 that have a 2 k resolution if you do not 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.150
 see what it is that he found down with the 

00:03:02.859 --> 00:03:06.819
 description of a video in which I will 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:09.430
 explain so do not worry but 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:11.769
 well we continue with this video that 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:13.000
 you will find the nexus 5 in which 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:15.489
 all these are some benefits 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.790
 really very good and that you could 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:20.889
 say that quality-price are the best 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:22.750
 although there is the reason why the 

00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:25.030
 battery loose as it has some 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:28.389
 great features but a price 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:30.310
 not to be very high for 

00:03:28.389 --> 00:03:31.810
 have benefits things then 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:33.609
 they have to loosen in several aspects 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:35.409
 that I am going to comment now as 

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:38.109
 it can be the battery that has 

00:03:35.409 --> 00:03:40.719
 only 2300 nor amps offered 

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:43.959
 a very normal autonomy and that despite 

00:03:40.719 --> 00:03:47.260
 its 200 thousand amps thanks to the great 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:49.419
 management of Android 4.4 makes the 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:51.010
 battery can last a day and 

00:03:49.419 --> 00:03:52.689
 little or that it does it quite 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:55.740
 affordable for what you're spending 

00:03:52.689 --> 00:03:58.170
 no high-end terminal 

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:59.640
 two other aspects which does not stand out 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:01.890
 nexus 5 but that has made a great 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:03.780
 improvement comparing it with last year is 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:06.540
 for its camera zoomed to the 8 camera 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:08.280
 megapixels with optical stabilizer that 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:10.740
 does understand is a terminal with a 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:13.260
 fairly good camera does not reach the 

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:15.000
 quality of a 6 13 is one but it works 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:17.850
 pretty good and comparing it with the 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.639
 previous its power and its quality of 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:22.710
 picture are much better 

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:24.210
 and good until here it will have arrived a little 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:26.249
 I think you're going to meet the 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:27.960
 performance with the battery with what it is 

00:04:26.249 --> 00:04:30.090
 the in his five in general so in 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:31.949
 summary it should be noted that it is the best 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:35.879
 terminal quality-price is they are and not 

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:38.460
 hesitate if you have 150 euros or 400 os 

00:04:35.879 --> 00:04:40.110
 I invite you to buy this terminal and 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:42.090
 which is one of the terminal eyes that 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:44.400
 then find it right now and that 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:46.020
 would have such a great quality that it 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:47.669
 could last even the two 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:51.419
 years or three 

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:53.129
 It depends on how you are as a user and 

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:54.900
 good at the end of the video 

00:04:53.129 --> 00:04:56.669
 I would love for you to leave me the comments 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:58.860
 How loyal did you find the video that I 

00:04:56.669 --> 00:05:01.110
 you leave a like also that that really 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:02.909
 help and tell me what else 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:05.370
 analysis of other terminals you would like 

00:05:02.909 --> 00:05:07.229
 see on the channel that I would love 

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:09.840
 look for them and leave us to be able to 

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:11.639
 do these analyzes that do not get to be 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:13.949
 analysis because there are already many analyzes 

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:16.080
 on YouTube about this terminal but that 

00:05:13.949 --> 00:05:18.400
 you'll find yourself a bit like that in my opinion 

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:21.400
 personal and what will bring us 

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:23.850
 so if you liked that you 

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:23.850
 subscribe 

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:27.060
 goodbye
