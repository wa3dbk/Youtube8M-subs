one<00:01:52.850> and<00:01:53.850> there's<00:01:54.030> a<00:01:54.090> reason<00:01:54.329> that<00:01:54.390> it<00:01:55.110> escapes

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
one and there's a reason that it escapes

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.100 
one and there's a reason that it escapes
me<00:01:55.560> at<00:01:55.649> the<00:01:55.770> moment<00:01:55.829> but<00:01:56.280> I<00:01:56.729> believe<00:01:57.600> the<00:01:57.960> one

me at the moment but I believe the one

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.459 
me at the moment but I believe the one
you<00:01:58.380> can<00:01:58.590> use<00:01:58.799> right<00:01:58.979> now<00:01:59.159> are<00:01:59.790> three<00:02:00.240> ones<00:02:00.479> and
