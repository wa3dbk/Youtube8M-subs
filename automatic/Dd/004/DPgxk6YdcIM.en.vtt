when<00:00:22.230> you<00:00:22.859> didn't<00:00:23.430> tell<00:00:23.609> people<00:00:24.000> what<00:00:24.210> was

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
when you didn't tell people what was

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.109 
when you didn't tell people what was
going<00:00:24.689> on<00:00:24.840> because<00:00:25.460> you<00:00:26.460> never<00:00:26.670> know<00:00:26.910> when

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
going on because you never know when

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.990 
going on because you never know when
they<00:00:27.269> would<00:00:27.510> report<00:00:27.960> it<00:00:28.230> to<00:00:28.980> the<00:00:29.099> overseer<00:00:29.699> to

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
they would report it to the overseer to

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.970 
they would report it to the overseer to
the<00:00:30.150> slave<00:00:30.539> master<00:00:31.140> and<00:00:31.260> you<00:00:31.349> think<00:00:31.590> really

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
the slave master and you think really

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.250 
the slave master and you think really
get<00:00:32.219> in<00:00:32.369> a<00:00:32.460> lot<00:00:32.640> of<00:00:32.669> trouble<00:00:32.969> and<00:00:33.630> I<00:00:33.870> think<00:00:34.110> it's

get in a lot of trouble and I think it's
just<00:00:34.410> kind<00:00:34.649> of<00:00:34.829> a<00:00:34.950> cellular<00:00:35.700> memory<00:00:35.940> within<00:00:36.780> us

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
just kind of a cellular memory within us

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.860 
just kind of a cellular memory within us
that<00:00:37.410> you<00:00:37.590> just<00:00:38.010> don't<00:00:38.430> tell<00:00:38.790> because<00:00:39.390> it<00:00:39.690> puts

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
that you just don't tell because it puts

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.479 
that you just don't tell because it puts
you<00:00:39.989> in<00:00:40.020> danger<00:00:42.530> doesn't<00:00:43.530> service<00:00:44.129> at<00:00:44.309> all
