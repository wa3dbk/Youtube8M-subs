00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:07.620

 More to introduce this time is more of Salia 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:18.150
 Meaning this I mean Tsu bunch Dian has the meaning of obsidian 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:19.349
 The Bussari Ann is ne border seat all the tools is the ability of 1.2 times diamond Yuika 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.130
 I'm waiting 

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:28.090
 This was I'm not hits 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:28.960
 Nof 's bill Sword Obsidian's key If it is this, it has double the offensive power and endurance 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:34.760
 is 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:37.070
 It is probably 1.2 times, so this is fine 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.170
 From the bottom 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:44.399
 Then 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:44.399
 Scanner Ya damage song or given a 4 attribute 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:50.020
 Drop reinforcement 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:55.260
 I wonder if such damage can not increase the damage 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:56.950
 It looks like this side is put for the time being of Sabian Sword 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:03.730
 In this 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:09.140
 There is also a tool armor, but when I put on the armor I can not see from the third person viewpoint 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:12.740
 Has been attached properly to see if I armor I'm nothing so do not put in the line-of-sight 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:14.810
 It's a little bug that looks like nothing if you look at it here 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:17.330
 If you remove all 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:19.680
 I will be able to see again 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:24.670
 This is if we put this 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:28.159
 Maybe something in that armor is wrong 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:33.770
 At first it is how to make this 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:35.420
 At first you need this of lowering or ingot This ingot is obsidian whatever you want 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:40.700
 You should burn it 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:47.450
 Then you can make this of the deer in god 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:48.150
 You can make one eye here in yes Yes this in the tatoo diand in god ordinary 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:50.530
 Like a dog 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:54.330
 Then 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.330
 I can make a sword 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:59.650
 I can make it but I made it 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:02.370
 I am jealous 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:08.649
 It is Ono 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:10.550
 I can make it like this, so maybe this is 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:14.490
 No 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:17.540
 This is a custodian pixel 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:22.060
 I wonder why the pack sale 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:22.060
 I do not know this a little bit how to make it 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:28.080

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:42.170
 North volume 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:44.130
 This is also After the stairs on the Kana 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:47.220
 You can make a circular 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:48.870
 It is a step of obsidian 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.910
 ThatLookLikeThis 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:54.180
 You can make obsidian stairs 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:54.180

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:03.220
 It is huge stone 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:04.840

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:08.930
