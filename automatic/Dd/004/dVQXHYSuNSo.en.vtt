 I would like a memory of 2 GB 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:29.910
 the internal memory of I think that of 128 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:34.610

 documents or to edit but 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:11.569

 unfortunately for its processor is 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:49.050
 something slow for his ram memory and all that 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:50.909

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:53.960
 downloading apps really do not 

00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:57.180

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:59.849

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:10.080
 applications more and it made me a little 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:10.080
