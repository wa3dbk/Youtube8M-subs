that<00:01:31.390> it<00:01:31.479> seems<00:01:31.720> to<00:01:31.960> be<00:01:32.080> nerfing<00:01:32.530> a<00:01:32.650> whole<00:01:32.979> lot

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:33.400 
that it seems to be nerfing a whole lot

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:36.899 
that it seems to be nerfing a whole lot
now<00:01:33.760> I<00:01:33.790> think<00:01:34.420> there<00:01:35.350> I<00:01:35.740> think<00:01:36.369> the<00:01:36.490> logic

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:36.909 
now I think there I think the logic

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:38.910 
now I think there I think the logic
behind<00:01:37.000> us<00:01:37.360> if<00:01:37.510> if<00:01:37.810> you<00:01:38.080> guys<00:01:38.229> don't<00:01:38.380> know<00:01:38.619> they

behind us if if you guys don't know they
have<00:01:39.040> been<00:01:39.250> basically<00:01:40.060> nerve<00:01:40.390> cooking<00:01:41.080> they

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:41.500 
have been basically nerve cooking they

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.270 
have been basically nerve cooking they
have<00:01:41.770> which<00:01:42.700> it<00:01:43.210> was<00:01:43.570> needed<00:01:44.080> come<00:01:44.439> on<00:01:44.619> guy<00:01:44.860> it

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:45.280 
have which it was needed come on guy it

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.899 
have which it was needed come on guy it
was<00:01:45.490> needed<00:01:45.850> it<00:01:46.119> just<00:01:46.450> gave<00:01:46.659> so<00:01:46.990> much<00:01:47.170> XP<00:01:47.650> I

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
was needed it just gave so much XP I

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:51.000 
was needed it just gave so much XP I
loved<00:01:48.909> it<00:01:49.119> so<00:01:49.479> much<00:01:49.510> when<00:01:50.290> I<00:01:50.350> figure<00:01:50.740> that<00:01:50.890> out

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:51.010 
loved it so much when I figure that out

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:53.370 
loved it so much when I figure that out
I<00:01:51.070> I<00:01:51.460> used<00:01:51.850> it<00:01:52.000> for<00:01:52.180> my<00:01:52.299> second<00:01:52.750> character<00:01:53.170> and

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:53.380 
I I used it for my second character and

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.190 
I I used it for my second character and
it<00:01:53.979> seems<00:01:54.189> like<00:01:54.369> if<00:01:54.520> you<00:01:54.640> level<00:01:54.850> a<00:01:55.330> character

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:56.200 
it seems like if you level a character

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.140

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
it using the guides it seems like the

the chilies chili peppers are also just

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:06.759 
the chilies chili peppers are also just
you<00:03:04.730> know<00:03:04.849> a<00:03:05.030> lot<00:03:05.329> more<00:03:05.360> expensive<00:03:05.870> and<00:03:06.260> some

00:03:06.759 --> 00:03:06.769 
you know a lot more expensive and some

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:08.830 
you know a lot more expensive and some
of<00:03:06.860> the<00:03:06.950> Karma<00:03:07.340> vendors<00:03:07.700> also<00:03:07.940> as<00:03:08.329> well<00:03:08.540> that

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
of the Karma vendors also as well that

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.479 
of the Karma vendors also as well that
used<00:03:09.049> to<00:03:09.170> sell<00:03:09.349> these<00:03:09.470> cooking<00:03:09.769> materials

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:10.489 
used to sell these cooking materials

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:12.550 
used to sell these cooking materials
they're<00:03:11.209> just<00:03:11.239> they're<00:03:11.959> just<00:03:11.989> not<00:03:12.260> there

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
they're just they're just not there

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.680 
they're just they're just not there
anymore<00:03:12.799> and<00:03:13.190> I<00:03:14.000> guess<00:03:14.209> they<00:03:14.360> switch<00:03:14.660> the

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:14.690 
anymore and I guess they switch the

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:16.479 
anymore and I guess they switch the
Karma<00:03:15.110> vendors<00:03:15.470> or<00:03:15.709> you<00:03:16.040> have<00:03:16.130> to<00:03:16.220> get<00:03:16.370> them

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:16.489 
Karma vendors or you have to get them

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:18.580 
Karma vendors or you have to get them
from<00:03:16.640> drops<00:03:17.000> you<00:03:17.209> know<00:03:17.329> even<00:03:17.540> cinnamon<00:03:18.349> sticks

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
from drops you know even cinnamon sticks

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:20.080 
from drops you know even cinnamon sticks
you<00:03:18.680> have<00:03:18.769> to<00:03:18.860> get<00:03:19.010> it<00:03:19.130> from<00:03:19.160> chopping<00:03:19.730> wood

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
you have to get it from chopping wood

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:24.190 
you have to get it from chopping wood
which<00:03:20.900> makes<00:03:21.739> sense<00:03:22.160> I<00:03:22.430> guess<00:03:22.459> and<00:03:23.049> Irene<00:03:24.049> that

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:24.200 
which makes sense I guess and Irene that

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:25.449 
which makes sense I guess and Irene that
seems<00:03:24.440> like<00:03:24.560> they<00:03:24.680> don't<00:03:24.860> want<00:03:25.099> people<00:03:25.160> to

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:25.459 
seems like they don't want people to

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:28.660 
seems like they don't want people to
reach<00:03:25.640> endgame<00:03:26.269> too<00:03:26.599> quickly<00:03:27.019> that<00:03:27.920> people

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:28.670 
reach endgame too quickly that people

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:30.759 
reach endgame too quickly that people
are<00:03:28.760> already<00:03:28.940> almost<00:03:29.420> there<00:03:29.989> I<00:03:30.019> think<00:03:30.350> they

00:03:30.759 --> 00:03:30.769 
are already almost there I think they

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:33.400 
are already almost there I think they
actually<00:03:30.799> added<00:03:31.430> more<00:03:32.239> to<00:03:32.299> the<00:03:32.690> legendary<00:03:33.109> so

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:33.410 
actually added more to the legendary so

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:35.710 
actually added more to the legendary so
people<00:03:33.769> won't<00:03:34.010> reach<00:03:34.310> it<00:03:34.549> unless<00:03:34.790> they<00:03:35.569> have

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:35.720 
people won't reach it unless they have

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:38.199 
people won't reach it unless they have
been<00:03:35.900> playing<00:03:36.139> hours<00:03:36.950> and<00:03:37.160> hours<00:03:37.310> on<00:03:37.670> end<00:03:37.970> and

like<00:03:50.269> yes<00:03:50.660> you<00:03:50.930> know<00:03:51.019> I<00:03:51.049> finally<00:03:51.590> got<00:03:51.739> it

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:51.980 
like yes you know I finally got it

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:53.410 
like yes you know I finally got it
because<00:03:52.459> you<00:03:52.639> know<00:03:52.730> once<00:03:53.000> you<00:03:53.120> get<00:03:53.269> the

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:53.420 
because you know once you get the

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:56.020 
because you know once you get the
legendary<00:03:53.900> you're<00:03:54.079> like<00:03:54.290> what<00:03:55.280> else<00:03:55.609> to<00:03:55.880> do

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:56.030 
legendary you're like what else to do

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:58.599 
legendary you're like what else to do
like<00:03:56.329> that<00:03:56.540> that's<00:03:56.810> like<00:03:56.930> the<00:03:57.500> best<00:03:57.769> item<00:03:58.430> you

00:03:58.599 --> 00:03:58.609 
like that that's like the best item you

00:03:58.609 --> 00:04:01.599 
like that that's like the best item you
can<00:03:58.760> get<00:03:59.000> like<00:03:59.180> that's<00:03:59.420> that's<00:03:59.720> total<00:04:00.609> endgame

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:01.609 
can get like that's that's total endgame

00:04:01.609 --> 00:04:04.420 
can get like that's that's total endgame
for<00:04:01.639> you<00:04:01.910> it<00:04:02.500> hopefully<00:04:03.500> I<00:04:03.739> think<00:04:04.160> they<00:04:04.370> were

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:04.430 
for you it hopefully I think they were

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:07.210 
for you it hopefully I think they were
trying<00:04:04.819> to<00:04:05.380> extend<00:04:06.380> everything<00:04:06.950> because<00:04:07.099> they

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:07.220 
trying to extend everything because they

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:09.580 
trying to extend everything because they
nerf<00:04:07.609> the<00:04:07.790> dungeon<00:04:08.299> so<00:04:08.540> you<00:04:08.630> cant<00:04:09.019> speedrun

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:09.590 
nerf the dungeon so you cant speedrun

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:13.089 
nerf the dungeon so you cant speedrun
them<00:04:10.069> and<00:04:10.970> get<00:04:11.209> a<00:04:11.510> lot<00:04:11.930> of<00:04:11.989> loot<00:04:12.319> from<00:04:12.560> when<00:04:12.799> you

00:04:13.089 --> 00:04:13.099 
them and get a lot of loot from when you

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:14.680 
them and get a lot of loot from when you
know<00:04:13.220> as<00:04:13.370> much<00:04:13.609> as<00:04:13.670> you<00:04:13.910> were<00:04:14.030> getting<00:04:14.329> before

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:14.690 
know as much as you were getting before

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:17.620 
know as much as you were getting before
and<00:04:15.019> I<00:04:15.349> mean<00:04:15.739> has<00:04:16.370> anyone<00:04:16.609> realized<00:04:17.180> cursed

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:17.630 
and I mean has anyone realized cursed

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:20.020 
and I mean has anyone realized cursed
shore<00:04:17.959> and<00:04:18.320> mal<00:04:18.620> kurz<00:04:18.799> leap<00:04:19.039> they<00:04:19.340> the

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:20.030 
shore and mal kurz leap they the

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:23.740 
shore and mal kurz leap they the
Orient's<00:04:20.780> of<00:04:21.079> the<00:04:21.410> risen<00:04:21.590> are<00:04:21.829> so<00:04:22.820> hard<00:04:23.150> they

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:23.750 
Orient's of the risen are so hard they

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:26.110 
Orient's of the risen are so hard they
pull<00:04:24.139> you<00:04:24.410> they<00:04:24.680> mobilize<00:04:25.190> you<00:04:25.400> way<00:04:25.760> more<00:04:25.789> than

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:26.120 
pull you they mobilize you way more than

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:30.339 
pull you they mobilize you way more than
they<00:04:26.419> used<00:04:26.630> to<00:04:26.750> I<00:04:27.080> mean<00:04:27.710> 10<00:04:28.639> times<00:04:29.060> as<00:04:29.479> hard<00:04:30.110> to

00:04:30.339 --> 00:04:30.349 
they used to I mean 10 times as hard to

00:04:30.349 --> 00:04:33.909 
they used to I mean 10 times as hard to
get<00:04:30.500> ores<00:04:30.800> I<00:04:31.039> mean<00:04:31.190> sometimes<00:04:31.400> you<00:04:31.909> die<00:04:32.530> in<00:04:33.530> a

00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:33.919 
get ores I mean sometimes you die in a

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:36.190 
get ores I mean sometimes you die in a
group<00:04:34.280> is<00:04:34.610> it's<00:04:34.940> pretty<00:04:35.180> nuts

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:36.200 
group is it's pretty nuts

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:38.230 
group is it's pretty nuts
so<00:04:36.470> they're<00:04:37.100> making<00:04:37.340> a<00:04:37.430> harder<00:04:37.670> few<00:04:37.820> just<00:04:38.060> to

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:38.240 
so they're making a harder few just to

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:41.850 
so they're making a harder few just to
run<00:04:38.570> to<00:04:38.900> all<00:04:39.230> the<00:04:39.590> oars<00:04:39.860> in<00:04:40.370> a<00:04:40.730> mock<00:04:41.150> or<00:04:41.360> sleep<00:04:41.600> &amp;

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:41.860 
run to all the oars in a mock or sleep &amp;

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:45.820 
run to all the oars in a mock or sleep &amp;
Kirsh<00:04:42.860> or<00:04:43.130> so<00:04:43.580> I<00:04:44.000> guess<00:04:44.960> the<00:04:45.230> price<00:04:45.500> will<00:04:45.800> go

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:45.830 
Kirsh or so I guess the price will go

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:48.190 
Kirsh or so I guess the price will go
back<00:04:46.190> up<00:04:46.400> because<00:04:47.090> it<00:04:47.210> seems<00:04:47.510> like<00:04:47.660> they<00:04:48.170> did

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:48.200 
back up because it seems like they did

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:51.670 
back up because it seems like they did
the<00:04:48.380> same<00:04:48.680> thing<00:04:48.740> for<00:04:49.960> the<00:04:50.960> crafting

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:51.680 
the same thing for the crafting

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:54.220 
the same thing for the crafting
professions<00:04:51.920> that<00:04:52.400> use<00:04:52.670> wood<00:04:53.030> the<00:04:53.870> crafting

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:54.230 
professions that use wood the crafting

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:55.630 
professions that use wood the crafting
professor<00:04:54.620> says<00:04:54.770> use<00:04:54.950> what<00:04:54.980> they<00:04:55.310> went<00:04:55.550> up

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:55.640 
professor says use what they went up

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:58.180 
professor says use what they went up
from<00:04:55.970> two<00:04:56.330> to<00:04:56.600> three<00:04:56.630> so<00:04:57.110> you<00:04:57.170> need<00:04:57.410> three<00:04:57.770> to

00:04:58.180 --> 00:04:58.190 
from two to three so you need three to

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:01.240 
from two to three so you need three to
make<00:04:58.220> a<00:04:58.400> plank<00:04:58.820> so<00:04:59.510> the<00:05:00.050> price<00:05:00.320> for<00:05:00.590> would<00:05:00.830> kind

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:01.250 
make a plank so the price for would kind

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:03.160 
make a plank so the price for would kind
of<00:05:01.340> went<00:05:01.550> up<00:05:01.640> kinda<00:05:02.150> because<00:05:02.450> this<00:05:02.570> is<00:05:02.750> so<00:05:02.990> much

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:03.170 
of went up kinda because this is so much

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:05.920 
of went up kinda because this is so much
wood<00:05:03.530> there<00:05:03.800> so<00:05:04.370> much<00:05:04.760> wood<00:05:05.330> on<00:05:05.360> the<00:05:05.570> market

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:05.930 
wood there so much wood on the market

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:07.870 
wood there so much wood on the market
but<00:05:06.080> I'm<00:05:06.950> pretty<00:05:07.100> sure<00:05:07.250> there's<00:05:07.550> a<00:05:07.610> joke

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:07.880 
but I'm pretty sure there's a joke

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:09.160 
but I'm pretty sure there's a joke
somewhere<00:05:08.360> would<00:05:08.660> joke<00:05:08.870> in<00:05:09.020> there<00:05:09.110> somewhere

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:09.170 
somewhere would joke in there somewhere

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:11.530 
somewhere would joke in there somewhere
I<00:05:09.740> really<00:05:10.340> hope<00:05:10.490> they<00:05:10.610> don't<00:05:10.760> start<00:05:11.000> nerfing

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:11.540 
I really hope they don't start nerfing

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:14.440 
I really hope they don't start nerfing
the<00:05:11.660> orichalcum<00:05:12.350> though<00:05:12.530> orichalcum<00:05:13.250> or<00:05:13.520> the

the orichalcum though orichalcum or the

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:16.440 
the orichalcum though orichalcum or the
chocolate<00:05:14.690> or<00:05:15.050> needs<00:05:15.440> to<00:05:15.680> stay<00:05:15.890> there<00:05:16.160> it

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:16.450 
chocolate or needs to stay there it

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:19.480 
chocolate or needs to stay there it
right<00:05:17.450> now<00:05:17.630> there's<00:05:17.930> about<00:05:18.170> five<00:05:18.620> on<00:05:18.980> each<00:05:19.160> map

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:19.490 
right now there's about five on each map

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:22.120 
right now there's about five on each map
if<00:05:19.700> you<00:05:19.880> can<00:05:20.090> find<00:05:20.360> it<00:05:20.600> and<00:05:20.750> it<00:05:20.960> seems<00:05:21.320> to<00:05:22.010> be

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:22.130 
if you can find it and it seems to be

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:24.640 
if you can find it and it seems to be
harder<00:05:22.610> and<00:05:22.850> harder<00:05:23.180> to<00:05:23.540> find<00:05:23.570> all<00:05:24.110> five<00:05:24.410> on

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:24.650 
harder and harder to find all five on

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:25.900 
harder and harder to find all five on
the<00:05:24.740> map<00:05:24.890> I<00:05:25.010> mean<00:05:25.160> you<00:05:25.280> have<00:05:25.430> to<00:05:25.520> have<00:05:25.610> a<00:05:25.640> whole

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:25.910 
the map I mean you have to have a whole

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:28.630 
the map I mean you have to have a whole
part<00:05:26.150> to<00:05:26.360> scouting<00:05:26.690> every<00:05:27.260> inch<00:05:27.590> and<00:05:27.860> on<00:05:28.400> top

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:31.120 
part to scouting every inch and on top
of<00:05:28.670> that<00:05:28.850> you<00:05:29.150> have<00:05:29.180> you<00:05:29.720> know<00:05:29.870> all<00:05:30.170> the<00:05:30.680> Risen

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:31.130 
of that you have you know all the Risen

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:34.270 
of that you have you know all the Risen
going<00:05:31.460> nuts<00:05:31.850> on<00:05:32.060> you<00:05:32.240> giving<00:05:32.660> you<00:05:32.810> an<00:05:33.050> a<00:05:33.620> minute

going nuts on you giving you an a minute

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:37.390 
going nuts on you giving you an a minute
of<00:05:34.450> crippling<00:05:35.450> really<00:05:36.080> a<00:05:36.230> minute<00:05:37.220> of

of crippling really a minute of

of crippling really a minute of
crippling<00:05:38.090> I<00:05:38.390> could<00:05:39.230> it<00:05:39.380> I<00:05:39.590> was<00:05:40.190> just<00:05:40.310> sitting

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:40.520 
crippling I could it I was just sitting

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:43.300 
crippling I could it I was just sitting
there<00:05:40.670> just<00:05:41.030> limping<00:05:41.900> my<00:05:42.170> way<00:05:42.380> to<00:05:42.440> the<00:05:42.770> or<00:05:42.950> what
