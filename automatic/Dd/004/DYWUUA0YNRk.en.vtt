let's<00:01:22.380> can<00:01:23.380> walk<00:01:23.680> with<00:01:23.890> it<00:01:24.570> you<00:01:25.570> just

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:25.869 
let's can walk with it you just

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:28.620 
let's can walk with it you just
basically<00:01:26.409> screw<00:01:27.070> it<00:01:27.190> into<00:01:27.310> the<00:01:27.550> bottom<00:01:27.850> four

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:28.630

screws<00:01:29.050> hold<00:01:29.770> it<00:01:29.950> in<00:01:30.070> place

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.830
