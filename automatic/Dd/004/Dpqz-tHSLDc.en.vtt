there<00:04:58.810> blow<00:04:59.740> it<00:04:59.860> all<00:04:59.979> out<00:05:00.010> get<00:05:00.490> everything

00:05:00.689 --> 00:05:00.699 
there blow it all out get everything

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:03.540 
there blow it all out get everything
good<00:05:01.000> and<00:05:01.030> dry<00:05:01.389> okay<00:05:02.159> probably<00:05:03.159> wouldn't<00:05:03.460> hurt

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:03.550 
good and dry okay probably wouldn't hurt

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:04.710 
good and dry okay probably wouldn't hurt
before<00:05:03.729> you<00:05:03.970> do<00:05:04.120> any<00:05:04.300> kind<00:05:04.479> of<00:05:04.539> pressure

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:04.720 
before you do any kind of pressure

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:05.939 
before you do any kind of pressure
washing<00:05:05.050> like<00:05:05.349> that<00:05:05.530> though

00:05:05.939 --> 00:05:05.949 
washing like that though

00:05:05.949 --> 00:05:09.270 
washing like that though
maybe<00:05:06.610> spray<00:05:07.330> some<00:05:07.570> spray<00:05:07.960> silicone<00:05:08.500> around

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:09.280 
maybe spray some spray silicone around

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:11.159 
maybe spray some spray silicone around
the<00:05:09.490> cap<00:05:09.729> wires<00:05:10.090> things<00:05:10.479> like<00:05:10.690> that

00:05:11.159 --> 00:05:11.169 
the cap wires things like that

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:14.100 
the cap wires things like that
all<00:05:11.590> right<00:05:11.740> silicone<00:05:12.550> any<00:05:12.789> connections<00:05:13.360> that

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:14.110 
all right silicone any connections that

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:15.990 
all right silicone any connections that
you<00:05:14.260> can<00:05:14.409> think<00:05:14.650> of<00:05:14.800> all<00:05:15.610> right<00:05:15.760> which<00:05:15.880> I

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:16.000 
you can think of all right which I

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.159 
you can think of all right which I
usually<00:05:16.180> do<00:05:16.479> that<00:05:16.599> with<00:05:16.780> a<00:05:16.810> lot<00:05:16.960> of<00:05:16.990> my

00:05:17.159 --> 00:05:17.169 
usually do that with a lot of my

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:18.960 
usually do that with a lot of my
vehicles<00:05:17.590> anyway<00:05:17.919> dielectric<00:05:18.520> grease<00:05:18.550> is<00:05:18.940> a

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:18.970 
vehicles anyway dielectric grease is a

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:21.860 
vehicles anyway dielectric grease is a
good<00:05:19.150> idea<00:05:19.419> too<00:05:19.690> okay

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:21.870 
good idea too okay

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:24.300 
good idea too okay
silicone<00:05:22.870> obviously<00:05:23.320> repels<00:05:23.680> water<00:05:23.800> it<00:05:24.159> does

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:24.310 
silicone obviously repels water it does

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:26.670 
silicone obviously repels water it does
help<00:05:24.580> with<00:05:25.180> things<00:05:25.360> like<00:05:25.659> that<00:05:25.870> all<00:05:26.620> right

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:26.680 
help with things like that all right

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:28.260 
help with things like that all right
like<00:05:26.979> this<00:05:27.099> particular<00:05:27.580> engine<00:05:27.729> doesn't<00:05:28.030> look

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:28.270 
like this particular engine doesn't look

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:30.210 
like this particular engine doesn't look
awfully<00:05:28.720> terrible<00:05:29.169> but<00:05:29.710> is<00:05:29.830> what<00:05:29.949> I<00:05:29.979> would

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:30.220 
awfully terrible but is what I would

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:33.570 
awfully terrible but is what I would
probably<00:05:30.669> do<00:05:30.849> again<00:05:32.010> maybe<00:05:33.010> take<00:05:33.340> some

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:33.580 
probably do again maybe take some

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:35.760 
probably do again maybe take some
kerosene<00:05:34.330> spray<00:05:34.990> it<00:05:35.080> all<00:05:35.169> down<00:05:35.320> let<00:05:35.500> it<00:05:35.590> soak

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:35.770 
kerosene spray it all down let it soak

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:36.930 
kerosene spray it all down let it soak
for<00:05:35.979> about<00:05:36.039> an<00:05:36.279> hour<00:05:36.340> if<00:05:36.580> you<00:05:36.669> don't<00:05:36.789> have<00:05:36.880> to

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:36.940 
for about an hour if you don't have to

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:37.860 
for about an hour if you don't have to
drive<00:05:37.090> the<00:05:37.240> damn<00:05:37.389> thing

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:37.870 
drive the damn thing

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:40.650 
drive the damn thing
soak<00:05:38.220> pressure<00:05:39.220> wash<00:05:39.490> it<00:05:39.670> off<00:05:39.820> or<00:05:40.120> buy<00:05:40.300> some<00:05:40.540> of

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:40.660 
soak pressure wash it off or buy some of

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:44.280 
soak pressure wash it off or buy some of
that<00:05:41.550> engine<00:05:42.550> degreaser<00:05:42.940> same<00:05:43.570> thing<00:05:43.840> I<00:05:44.020> think

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:44.290 
that engine degreaser same thing I think

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:45.270 
that engine degreaser same thing I think
that<00:05:44.500> might<00:05:44.680> be<00:05:44.710> a<00:05:44.800> little<00:05:45.100> more

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:45.280 
that might be a little more

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:47.060 
that might be a little more
environmentally<00:05:45.730> friendly<00:05:45.970> a<00:05:46.510> little<00:05:46.870> bit

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:47.070 
environmentally friendly a little bit

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:49.740 
environmentally friendly a little bit
spray<00:05:48.070> it<00:05:48.130> let<00:05:48.340> it<00:05:48.370> soak<00:05:48.640> for<00:05:48.850> a<00:05:48.940> while<00:05:49.120> okay

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:49.750 
spray it let it soak for a while okay

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:51.630 
spray it let it soak for a while okay
definitely<00:05:50.440> try<00:05:50.560> to<00:05:50.590> do<00:05:50.800> it<00:05:50.920> on<00:05:51.010> a<00:05:51.040> you<00:05:51.400> know<00:05:51.520> if

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:51.640 
definitely try to do it on a you know if

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:53.160 
definitely try to do it on a you know if
you<00:05:51.730> can<00:05:51.940> start<00:05:52.270> it<00:05:52.360> up<00:05:52.450> let<00:05:52.660> her<00:05:52.750> get<00:05:52.840> warmed

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:53.170 
you can start it up let her get warmed

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:55.350 
you can start it up let her get warmed
up<00:05:53.260> shut<00:05:53.530> her<00:05:53.620> down<00:05:53.800> because<00:05:54.670> obviously<00:05:54.880> the

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:55.360 
up shut her down because obviously the

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:57.120 
up shut her down because obviously the
warmer<00:05:55.690> the<00:05:55.810> engine<00:05:56.080> is<00:05:56.230> yeah

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:57.130 
warmer the engine is yeah

00:05:57.130 --> 00:05:58.680 
warmer the engine is yeah
the<00:05:57.400> looser<00:05:57.760> that<00:05:57.940> grease<00:05:58.210> and<00:05:58.450> the<00:05:58.510> thinner

00:05:58.680 --> 00:05:58.690 
the looser that grease and the thinner

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:00.710 
the looser that grease and the thinner
that<00:05:58.870> grease<00:05:59.110> is<00:05:59.290> going<00:05:59.440> to<00:05:59.500> become<00:05:59.830> okay<00:06:00.310> in

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:00.720 
that grease is going to become okay in

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:03.270 
that grease is going to become okay in
latter<00:06:01.720> salt<00:06:02.050> pressure<00:06:02.320> washer<00:06:02.740> off<00:06:02.920> and<00:06:03.250> a

cleaner aluminum wheel cleaner I forget
who<00:06:11.440> makes<00:06:11.650> that<00:06:11.860> and<00:06:12.070> spray<00:06:13.000> the<00:06:13.180> aluminum

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:13.540 
who makes that and spray the aluminum

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:16.590 
who makes that and spray the aluminum
wheel<00:06:13.660> cleaner<00:06:13.690> on<00:06:14.230> and<00:06:14.940> then<00:06:15.940> pressure<00:06:16.330> wash

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:16.600 
wheel cleaner on and then pressure wash

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:18.270 
wheel cleaner on and then pressure wash
it<00:06:16.780> again<00:06:16.870> and<00:06:17.320> add<00:06:17.740> aluminum<00:06:17.920> wheel<00:06:18.250> cleaner

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:18.280 
it again and add aluminum wheel cleaner

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:20.040 
it again and add aluminum wheel cleaner
seems<00:06:18.760> to<00:06:18.880> do<00:06:18.970> a<00:06:19.000> hell<00:06:19.180> of<00:06:19.210> a<00:06:19.360> job<00:06:19.540> on<00:06:19.720> a<00:06:19.750> lot<00:06:19.960> of

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:20.050 
seems to do a hell of a job on a lot of

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:21.990 
seems to do a hell of a job on a lot of
