today's<00:00:14.219> question<00:00:14.670> is<00:00:14.940> a<00:00:15.000> pretty<00:00:15.389> simple<00:00:15.809> one

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
today's question is a pretty simple one

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:17.420 
today's question is a pretty simple one
it's<00:00:16.080> on<00:00:16.199> the<00:00:16.350> issue<00:00:16.830> of<00:00:16.980> creatine

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
it's on the issue of creatine

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.550 
it's on the issue of creatine
supplementation<00:00:18.180> and<00:00:18.539> more<00:00:18.750> specifically<00:00:19.260> on

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
supplementation and more specifically on

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.370 
supplementation and more specifically on
the<00:00:19.970> loading<00:00:20.970> phase<00:00:21.240> so<00:00:21.689> whether<00:00:21.900> or<00:00:21.990> not<00:00:22.230> it

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
the loading phase so whether or not it

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.519 
the loading phase so whether or not it
is<00:00:22.410> necessary<00:00:23.130> to<00:00:23.250> load<00:00:23.789> your<00:00:24.000> creatine<00:00:24.570> and

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
is necessary to load your creatine and

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.130 
is necessary to load your creatine and
perform<00:00:26.039> the<00:00:26.310> the<00:00:26.970> five-day<00:00:27.570> loading<00:00:27.960> phase

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
perform the the five-day loading phase

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.990 
perform the the five-day loading phase
as<00:00:28.410> opposed<00:00:29.010> to<00:00:29.099> just<00:00:29.250> taking<00:00:29.580> a<00:00:29.670> standard

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
as opposed to just taking a standard

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.420 
as opposed to just taking a standard
dosage<00:00:30.210> each<00:00:30.539> day<00:00:30.750> so<00:00:30.810> the<00:00:31.050> recommended<00:00:31.590> daily

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
dosage each day so the recommended daily

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.549 
dosage each day so the recommended daily
study<00:00:33.030> dose<00:00:33.270> for<00:00:33.540> creatine<00:00:33.840> monohydrate<00:00:34.050> is

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
study dose for creatine monohydrate is

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.770 
study dose for creatine monohydrate is
about<00:00:34.920> 3<00:00:35.430> to<00:00:35.550> 5<00:00:35.700> grams<00:00:36.000> per<00:00:36.270> day<00:00:36.420> for<00:00:36.480> most

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
about 3 to 5 grams per day for most

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.150 
about 3 to 5 grams per day for most
people<00:00:37.079> which<00:00:37.200> is<00:00:37.320> equal<00:00:37.620> to<00:00:37.649> about<00:00:37.980> a

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
people which is equal to about a

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.190 
people which is equal to about a
teaspoon<00:00:38.790> and<00:00:38.940> the<00:00:39.540> goal<00:00:39.780> of<00:00:39.960> creatine

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
teaspoon and the goal of creatine

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.470 
teaspoon and the goal of creatine
supplementation<00:00:40.770> is<00:00:41.190> to<00:00:41.579> achieve<00:00:42.059> full

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
supplementation is to achieve full

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.660 
supplementation is to achieve full
creatine<00:00:43.200> saturation<00:00:43.379> of<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.160> muscle<00:00:44.430> tissue

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
creatine saturation of the muscle tissue

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:45.560 
creatine saturation of the muscle tissue
so<00:00:44.700> you<00:00:44.850> can<00:00:44.969> go<00:00:45.090> about<00:00:45.270> this<00:00:45.360> in<00:00:45.450> a<00:00:45.539> couple

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
so you can go about this in a couple

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.840 
so you can go about this in a couple
ways<00:00:45.989> you<00:00:46.500> can<00:00:46.649> either<00:00:46.770> just<00:00:47.039> start<00:00:47.370> off<00:00:47.520> from

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
ways you can either just start off from

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.360 
ways you can either just start off from
day<00:00:48.090> 1<00:00:48.390> and<00:00:48.629> take<00:00:49.200> 3<00:00:49.469> to<00:00:49.530> 5<00:00:49.680> grams<00:00:49.950> of<00:00:50.100> creatine

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
day 1 and take 3 to 5 grams of creatine

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.910 
day 1 and take 3 to 5 grams of creatine
per<00:00:50.700> day<00:00:50.820> continuously<00:00:51.510> if<00:00:51.780> you<00:00:52.110> do<00:00:52.350> that<00:00:52.620> you

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
per day continuously if you do that you

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.040 
per day continuously if you do that you
will<00:00:53.129> achieve<00:00:53.420> full<00:00:54.420> creatine<00:00:54.870> saturation

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
will achieve full creatine saturation

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.569 
will achieve full creatine saturation
after<00:00:55.920> about<00:00:56.219> 20<00:00:56.640> days<00:00:56.820> or<00:00:57.180> you<00:00:58.109> can<00:00:58.469> get<00:00:59.430> those

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
after about 20 days or you can get those

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.490 
after about 20 days or you can get those
results<00:00:59.820> quicker<00:01:00.329> by<00:01:00.690> performing<00:01:01.140> a<00:01:01.199> loading

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
results quicker by performing a loading

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.500 
results quicker by performing a loading
phase<00:01:01.530> there's<00:01:02.250> no<00:01:02.399> single<00:01:02.940> loading<00:01:03.329> phase

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
phase there's no single loading phase

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.690 
phase there's no single loading phase
protocol<00:01:04.110> but<00:01:04.470> a<00:01:04.650> pretty<00:01:04.890> standard<00:01:05.250> method<00:01:05.610> is

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
protocol but a pretty standard method is

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.030 
protocol but a pretty standard method is
where<00:01:05.909> you're<00:01:06.060> going<00:01:06.180> to<00:01:06.240> take<00:01:06.510> in<00:01:06.830> 20<00:01:07.830> grams

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
where you're going to take in 20 grams

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.300 
where you're going to take in 20 grams
of<00:01:08.250> creatine<00:01:08.549> for<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.060> first<00:01:09.299> 5<00:01:09.659> days<00:01:10.070> so<00:01:11.070> 4

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
of creatine for the first 5 days so 4

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.670 
of creatine for the first 5 days so 4
servings<00:01:11.520> of<00:01:11.729> 5<00:01:11.939> grams<00:01:12.299> and<00:01:12.630> then<00:01:13.170> just<00:01:13.500> follow

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
servings of 5 grams and then just follow

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.380 
servings of 5 grams and then just follow
the<00:01:13.830> 3-5<00:01:14.220> gram<00:01:14.490> per<00:01:14.640> day<00:01:14.729> maintenance<00:01:15.180> dose

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
the 3-5 gram per day maintenance dose

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.149 
the 3-5 gram per day maintenance dose
after<00:01:15.659> that<00:01:16.140> if<00:01:16.320> you<00:01:16.409> do<00:01:16.590> that<00:01:16.770> you're<00:01:17.009> going

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
after that if you do that you're going

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:18.350 
after that if you do that you're going
to<00:01:17.189> achieve<00:01:17.310> full<00:01:17.729> creatine<00:01:18.180> saturation

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
to achieve full creatine saturation

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.200 
to achieve full creatine saturation
after<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.350> 5<00:01:19.530> day<00:01:19.740> loading<00:01:19.950> period<00:01:20.280> so<00:01:21.060> that's

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
after the 5 day loading period so that's

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.999 
after the 5 day loading period so that's
really<00:01:21.390> all<00:01:21.540> there<00:01:21.659> is<00:01:21.720> to<00:01:22.020> it<00:01:22.140> the<00:01:22.470> end<00:01:22.619> result

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
really all there is to it the end result

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.649 
really all there is to it the end result
is<00:01:23.130> exactly<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:23.640> same<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:24.299> only<00:01:24.330> difference

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
is exactly the same the only difference

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.359 
is exactly the same the only difference
is<00:01:25.049> that<00:01:25.200> if<00:01:25.380> you<00:01:25.470> perform<00:01:25.650> a<00:01:25.890> loading<00:01:26.189> phase

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
is that if you perform a loading phase

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.160 
is that if you perform a loading phase
you're<00:01:26.909> going<00:01:27.060> to<00:01:27.119> see<00:01:27.299> those<00:01:27.479> results<00:01:27.900> after

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
you're going to see those results after

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.440 
you're going to see those results after
sort<00:01:28.770> of<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:29.159> full<00:01:29.670> results<00:01:30.090> of<00:01:30.180> creatine

usage<00:01:30.869> after<00:01:31.229> 5<00:01:31.470> days<00:01:31.500> and<00:01:32.009> if<00:01:32.820> you<00:01:33.030> just

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
usage after 5 days and if you just

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.420

follow the 3 to 5 gram per day goes from

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:36.620 
follow the 3 to 5 gram per day goes from
the<00:01:35.520> get-go<00:01:35.729> you're<00:01:36.030> going<00:01:36.150> to<00:01:36.210> get<00:01:36.329> the<00:01:36.420> full

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
the get-go you're going to get the full

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.410 
the get-go you're going to get the full
benefits<00:01:37.020> after<00:01:37.369> about<00:01:38.369> 20<00:01:38.729> days<00:01:38.880> so<00:01:39.299> it's

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
benefits after about 20 days so it's

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.370
