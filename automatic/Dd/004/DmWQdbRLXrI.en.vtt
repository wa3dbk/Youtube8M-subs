00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:09.510
 a all the rockies of the decline of 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.040
 sporting al is the other ideal trick 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.320
 another trick so you can 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.929
 save luxury vehicles in the garage 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.090
 vehicles that are moderate or those 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.220
 that have turbo vehicles that you 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.840
 no story mode bring it online 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.370
 we have said all kinds of vehicles up 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.080
 the place to have any of these 

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:27.120
 of even to say it to be able to do 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.320
 and the best thing is you have opportunities 

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:30.480
 will show us so that you 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.059
 can do totally alone no longer 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.890
 they need friends from half of anyone 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.480
 to help them simply with having the 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.219
 vigor that you want to keep the 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.410
 enough garage then how are they given 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:43.379
 account that I bring here I am driving 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.239
 an uncapped kalahari that I brought the 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.859
 Story mode elsewhere'm going to 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.480
 show how they can get it for 

00:00:46.859 --> 00:00:50.039
 that all those who like me I know 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.019
 that I have many subscribers that 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.550
 like this vehicle then already in a 

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:54.629
 next video I'm going to show you how 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.519
 can enter from the story mode 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.289
 good this method is that 

00:00:56.519 --> 00:01:00.510
 we need to call or alert the 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.550
 police so that it goes next to 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.229
 our garage is implying for the 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.060
 people who have normal garages 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.979
 those of 400,000 who do not have this 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.869
 garage the one that you heard the truck here is 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.650
 a migrant who is touched do something else 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.500
 different 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.300
 have we say that some complication 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:18.270
 it means that you have to do here what 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:19.320
 you have to do is get to your 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.120
 garage as it is told this is a 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.350
 vehicle but you can save it then 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.880
 for people who do not have this 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.250
 garage simply have to park 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.200
 the car there or the vehicle there and call 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.790
 to the police from the cell phone if not 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.800
 they know how to do it they just get 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.260
 to the contacts by pressing an xy button 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:36.150
 the xbox 360 or the square button comes out and 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:38.970
 they are in playstation 3 then there 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.140
 they dial 911 and they simply wait for 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.030
 the police arrive when the 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.160
 What police will do is kill 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.979
 the police and once they have 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:49.229
 eliminated being able to place the vehicle at 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.090
 side of the police patrol then 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.250
 with this the only thing he has to do is 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.260
 just enter the garage and already 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.090
 avoid it what they have to do to 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.380
 the people who have this garage in 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.479
 the man in which I am here 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.520
 we indicate that by attracting the police 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.200
 then they have to do that they have to 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.330
 alert the police and they have to 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.679
 attract it to this side because because 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:10.719
 when you call the police 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:13.299
 let's say you ask for it to come 

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:15.340
 the police no no I do not know why it does not arrive 

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:19.329
 it just goes to one more street 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:20.829
 down they just never come to this 

00:02:19.329 --> 00:02:22.629
 zone and we need the vehicle of the 

00:02:20.829 --> 00:02:24.760
 police arrive as close to the garage 

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:27.099
 possible then we can simply 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:29.079
 to do is to kill a few people and 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:30.730
 it will simply arrive to our garage 

00:02:29.079 --> 00:02:33.280
 once we are here our garage 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:36.099
 we wait for the vehicle the police and 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:38.200
 is back and police approach and 

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:39.849
 get as close as you can once you're 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.290
 as close as I can that really does not 

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:43.269
 It is very close but good is close 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:45.069
 is the important thing then once you 're 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:46.510
 close what I have to do is kill 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:49.299
 the police as he had already explained to the 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:50.739
 others and as we already have several 

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:52.359
 outside how to do is to make us here 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:54.040
 where are we going to enter and is arabia and 

00:02:52.359 --> 00:02:56.200
 just call lester to remove 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.819
 to the police when we do this never 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.469
 will happen is that we will be able to enter 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:01.389
 to the garage the people who do not have 

00:02:59.469 --> 00:03:02.799
 we come to this garage and the only thing 

00:03:01.389 --> 00:03:04.209
 has to do is simply kill 

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:06.459
 the police expect him to be removed 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:08.139
 health say then search and 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:09.579
 enter the garage then once 

00:03:08.139 --> 00:03:10.840
 we have the garage entrance simply 

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:12.340
 we look for the vehicle we want 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.720
 replace and we use the trick that 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.580
 I showed the last time I was with the 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.290
 help from some 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:17.580
 but this time it's just simply 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:19.140
 We explain we got back to some 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:21.390
 vehicle we are going to look for an activity 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:23.100
 fast and when nothing will we accept 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:25.410
 then we have to press on that 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:26.610
 accept the mission and accelerate the 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:29.670
 vehicle at the same time then 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:31.710
 they install xbox because it is the button to rt and if 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:34.260
 they are in playstation 3 because it is the button 

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:36.060
 x and r2 you have to press the 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.260
 same time so that you know that you are 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:39.360
 working that they did it well 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:41.210
 you just have to hear that the 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:44.040
 garage door will open and once 

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:45.690
 appear here in any game of the 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.790
 peace will appear any random game 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:49.590
 all they are going to do is return be 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:50.820
 your garage remember that they have very few 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:53.580
 seconds to get on the vehicle 

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:54.750
 then try to be guided let's say 

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:56.880
 in the garage I know it's not very easy 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:58.440
 because one appears without knowing where 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:00.390
 be but then try to do 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:02.160
 several times and know where they have 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:03.660
 that running you already one time is one 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:05.490
 vehicle obviously this one 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:07.290
 will keep that same trick at the same time 

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:08.730
 last as I told you, it is to stop 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:11.150
 friends just that in this 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:13.530
 opportunity then it works because 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:15.240
 mysteriously with the car or with the 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:17.970
 police vehicle our 

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:19.230
 vehicle does not disappear then that 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:20.940
 is a new way is a new method 

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:22.980
 what works for all people 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:25.560
 have you say many friends playing 

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:26.880
 big favor that do not have say 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:28.710
 the connected friends if they want to save 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.970
 some vehicle in the garage we are in 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:31.890
 a story is quite simple 

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:33.840
 it is simply to alert the police and 

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:36.510
 make your garage next door 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:39.420
 as close as possible to kill the policemen and 

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:41.040
 Let's say our vehicle is the most 

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:42.930
 close possibility to the vehicle of the 

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:44.790
 policemen but also keep in mind 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:46.950
 that has to be as close to 

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:48.720
 your garage already does that as I told you 

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:50.310
 he has very few seconds to turn to 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:52.140
 get on the vehicle and it is very possible that 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:53.460
 if they do not go very far they will not reach 

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:55.680
 security the vehicle and in that way the 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:56.940
 vehicle if it's going to disappear then 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:58.740
 I hope you like the video what 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:00.120
 send leave your life favorites comment 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:01.800
 these vehicles could be stored in 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:03.300
 your garage and obviously subscribe to 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:04.590
 channel if not yet milk then 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:06.000
 I hope you can save all the 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:08.870
 vehicles that want inside garage no 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.870
 Let's go until next time
