see they're pretty cool feature yeah um

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.840 
see they're pretty cool feature yeah um
I<00:02:03.450> don't<00:02:03.749> know<00:02:03.840> if<00:02:04.219> like<00:02:05.219> for<00:02:05.429> me<00:02:05.520> I<00:02:05.549> was<00:02:05.789> having

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
I don't know if like for me I was having

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.849 
I don't know if like for me I was having
problems<00:02:06.390> at<00:02:06.539> first<00:02:06.780> to<00:02:06.990> figure<00:02:07.229> out<00:02:07.320> how<00:02:07.710> it

00:02:07.849 --> 00:02:07.859 
problems at first to figure out how it

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:10.070 
problems at first to figure out how it
works<00:02:08.100> because<00:02:08.970> i<00:02:09.000> did<00:02:09.570> have<00:02:09.690> multitasking

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
works because i did have multitasking

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.750 
works because i did have multitasking
gestures<00:02:10.289> before<00:02:10.649> and<00:02:11.039> i<00:02:11.100> downloaded<00:02:11.670> it<00:02:11.730> to

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
gestures before and i downloaded it to

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.390 
gestures before and i downloaded it to
my<00:02:11.940> old<00:02:12.300> multitasking<00:02:13.019> gestures<00:02:13.080> so<00:02:13.980> kind<00:02:14.250> of

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
my old multitasking gestures so kind of

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.949 
my old multitasking gestures so kind of
tweaked<00:02:14.640> it<00:02:14.760> out<00:02:14.879> a<00:02:14.909> little<00:02:15.120> if<00:02:15.360> you<00:02:15.659> have<00:02:15.780> more

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
tweaked it out a little if you have more

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:18.080 
tweaked it out a little if you have more
tasking<00:02:16.409> gestures<00:02:16.769> do<00:02:16.920> not<00:02:17.040> try<00:02:17.340> this<00:02:17.370> at<00:02:17.610> all

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
tasking gestures do not try this at all

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.780 
tasking gestures do not try this at all
so<00:02:18.390> maybe<00:02:18.959> it's<00:02:19.230> just<00:02:19.290> me<00:02:19.650> and<00:02:19.680> just<00:02:20.310> it's<00:02:20.730> just

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
so maybe it's just me and just it's just

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.119 
so maybe it's just me and just it's just
me<00:02:21.150> maybe<00:02:21.569> you<00:02:21.959> have<00:02:22.080> to<00:02:22.170> go<00:02:22.290> into<00:02:22.440> settings<00:02:22.890> if

00:02:23.119 --> 00:02:23.129 
me maybe you have to go into settings if

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:25.520 
me maybe you have to go into settings if
you<00:02:23.340> don't<00:02:23.489> if<00:02:23.640> once<00:02:24.269> you<00:02:24.390> download<00:02:24.750> empty

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
you don't if once you download empty

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.949 
you don't if once you download empty
most<00:02:26.099> empty<00:02:26.700> gestures<00:02:27.180> and<00:02:27.420> if<00:02:27.660> you<00:02:27.750> go<00:02:27.900> to
