00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:19.619
 hello and welcome to geek newspaper 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:22.050
 it's anne so today I'm 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.000
 at asus and so I present you a 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.250
 prototype of tai chi so the level 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.050
 laptop future success the hull is 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.130
 supposed to come out by the end of the year and 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.359
 which is a little different simply 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.099
 because so as can see here 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.780
 it's an ultrabook all that is more 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.380
 classic with a touch screen under 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.719
 windows 8 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.370
 oh dear the big news is in fact 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.450
 the no one would swear jouve has sealed 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.410
 all that is detail in terms of 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:45.539
 technical capabilities then however did 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.149
 not the big news is that if we 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.980
 just cook a little screen there you see 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.230
 that there is a second screen that allows 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.559
 so to have windows tablet mode 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.660
 8 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.430
 so you 're going to row two screens in one 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.050
 so it's pretty awesome because 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:02.160
 that when you go to see it is enough 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:04.799
 simple and and suddenly it removes that 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.990
 remove this hinge side that we have 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.520
 could see for example on the sony vaio duo 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.610
 pink and that and we keep some 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.590
 finesse because you can see here 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:15.060
 it's relatively crack so 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.520
 comparison I showed you the little 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.650
 13 inches the zenbook is there but you 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.619
 can see that on 11 inches where we have 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:25.290
 two bush screens that are very very 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:27.810
 hungry and that gives some 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:33.430
 experience a little bit different 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:34.240
 what we can see with the rest I 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:36.130
 think I've pretty much done the trick 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.689
 so it's still a prototype so for 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:40.390
 the moment I have not much and that 

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:42.880
 does not work great but I think 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:44.229
 it's a waiter by Christmas 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.579
 he's supposed to go out because it's 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:46.500
 really a model that counts 

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:48.490
 commercialize 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.140
 here we are at the moment thanks a lot for 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:52.590
 your attention and see you soon on the 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.590
