00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:18.299
 a question and social networks 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:34.080
 is not easy 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.730
 worcester there contiguous 15 and there I think that 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:42.430
 with the two functions 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:43.900
 to 11 thousand Argentine pesos are the 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:46.329
 alive if I'm not mistaken it's also a 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:49.809
 special edition but 9,000 pesos without the 

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:55.480
 money if after we go to services 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:58.870
 and applications games converted to 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:02.230
 weights are supposed to that price 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:03.699
 important that is something important 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:06.580
 also that I do not want to forget guys 

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:08.430
 very important just tomorrow 7 of 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:13.270
 November 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:15.840
 dreams of dreams that we have to start 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:20.369
 the presale and just on December 3 3 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.369
 December between would be delivered 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.560
 unfortunately I do not have the microphone of 

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:24.970
 hand so let's use the 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.009
 tie as if it were the microphone to 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:28.420
 my hand and I think I said that think 

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:29.020
 about the people that we said in the 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.929
 opposites 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:34.690
 but I left last year in Argentina 

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:36.850
 so I would tell them I tell you that 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:39.160
 try to get 7 years is not a data 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:39.789
 minor the xbox one takes a year in 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:41.440
 arrive 

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:43.510
 remember that I was not going to go out with 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:45.970
 official support for Argentina was not 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:47.260
 among the 16 initial countries in which 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:48.910
 the iphone was going to come out 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.980
 much controversy in your ad one of 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:52.630
 3 deplorable but microsoft is 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:54.220
 beginning to clean your image 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:56.620
 he did it with films thinking when what 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:58.090
 he met the division of xbox and changed 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:00.040
 completely the image of the company I 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.570
 it seems that he bet the games bet not 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.760
 to the players but to the games to the 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:05.020
 betting players sony but xbox is 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.220
 betting on the games well to the 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.530
 Argentina with a price that is not even 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:09.490
 bad nor good is what was expected is 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:11.110
 more or less in what is a 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:13.330
 playstation 4 if you buy without kinect 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:15.070
 what did you want him to want if you do not 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.230
 they are using no game the truth that 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:19.090
 I do not know and we do not have support as 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:20.710
 for cable as if it's in the USA so 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.110
 there would not be too many reasons to 

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:24.880
 buy a link with kinect 9 thousand pesos 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.220
 I think me a competitive price 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:30.340
 it seems a price that is not exorbitant 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:32.080
 it's not cheap I wish it were less because 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.330
 that's the difference completely from 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.760
 PlayStation 4 would put it in a position 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:38.560
 ideal has going to have official support 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.020
 for the region for our country 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.880
 that does serve that good we'll see what 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:44.410
 differences there are with playstation in 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:46.420
 As for the worlds, it seems to me that they come 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:47.830
 with new games if you want a fake 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:49.280
 football fan you will have it in 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:51.440
 the script is going to be a new 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.940
 I think it's interesting 9000 pesos 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.640
 with a series of cricket environment well 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:57.050
 the black flag that is 4 is decent for 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.550
 follow the tamales because consider the 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:00.290
 price of progressing a today that 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:01.910
 surely thousands of Argentines are 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:03.890
 thousand Argentine pesos and they were the ones that 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:06.230
 save say we pay but you 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:08.390
 you would save for a light remove in a 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:10.069
 game totally actually also 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:12.170
 It is on par with what they are doing 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:14.660
 today in the strength of all 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:17.330
 united that is 350 dollars some worlds 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:20.120
 with an included game or 400 with eyes 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:22.160
 new in that case the psuv is being 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:24.470
 betting strongly to reverse his image 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:27.470
 that it was a more expensive console a bit 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:29.209
 restrictive and that is not being able to give 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:30.950
 the return in this first stage of the 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:32.930
 console war now let's see from 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:34.310
 video because they are calling the stage 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:36.410
 a quilombo comes mario pergolini is going 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:40.180
 to say I do not know what so thank you very much 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:40.180
 to see see you in upcoming videos 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.909
 because I got the complicated 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:52.580
 subscribe to the channel on the networks 

00:03:47.909 --> 00:03:52.580
 social the truth was not very difficult
