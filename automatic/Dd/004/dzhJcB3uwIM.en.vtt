00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:19.160
 &gt;&gt; See girls. Tell me, what can we do with such a cardboard box that we throw out every day and bottle caps? 

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:21.480
 Here we have all the necessary ingredients. 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.000
 &gt;&gt; Game 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.000
 &gt;&gt; For example, what? 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:24.700
 &gt;&gt; Checkers. 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.160
 &gt;&gt; Super, maybe we can make checkers now? What do you say? 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:27.500
 &gt;&gt; Yes. 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:28.900
 &gt;&gt; Well, then we're getting to work. 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.500
 &gt;&gt; To make checkers we will need: 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:33.900
 Game pieces. 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.900
 &gt;&gt; For this purpose, we prepare 16 bottle caps. 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:39.700
 &gt;&gt; Eight in one color. 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:40.500
 &gt;&gt; And eight in the second. 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:52.000
 &gt;&gt; If you do not have the right number of caps in one color, you can paint them with paints or crayons. It is important that there are two colors to distinguish the team. 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:00.000
 &gt;&gt; Game board - made of cardboard. It can be after breakfast cereal or a pizza box. 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.000
 &gt;&gt; The size of the board depends on you and your child. 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:04.500
 &gt;&gt; Scissors 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.000
 &gt;&gt; Paint of poster or crayon which will serve us to paint certain fields on the board. 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.000
 &gt;&gt; We start from creating a game board. 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.800
 &gt;&gt; Then we divide it into 64 identical squares 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:39.800
 &gt;&gt; To draw the squares, we will use pencils and the remaining piece of cardboard, which can be used as a ruler to draw individual lines. 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:51.500
 &gt;&gt; Then, together with the child, mark the places that will be colored and choose the colors that you will use when filling the squares. 23 00: 01: 544,300 -&gt; 00: 02: 01,800 &gt;&gt; Choose one color "light" and the other color "dark" - so that the boards are sufficiently different from each other. 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.800
 &gt;&gt; Then, on the dried board, place the pieces. 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.800
 &gt;&gt; Remember that after each game we have to clean up after each other. And also remember about the segregation of rubbish. 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.800
 &gt;&gt; And now we can get on with fun? Who is first? 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:22.700
 &gt;&gt; You have to bet here. 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
 &gt;&gt; Bravo, and another point for Maja.
