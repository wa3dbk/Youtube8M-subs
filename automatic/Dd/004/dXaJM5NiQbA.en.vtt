00:00:04.189 --> 00:00:10.469
 guys back on the channel then 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:13.049
 today I make a video tutorial on 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:16.470
 hair makes me laugh a lot 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:19.920
 you will see that I am really hampered though 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:22.710
 a lot of you liked the mouth 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.380
 in ours I had in the tuborg video 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.419
 where we announce you to come in 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.630
 vacation with me the methodology is a bit 

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:32.970
 different from the usual because I use more 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:35.880
 tools but no more talk I leave you 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:38.820
 to the video honorino wash your hair and there 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:42.600
 I dried with brushes and hair dryer then 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:44.910
 I leave like this and take a protector of the 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.460
 ostrich heat well on the lengths 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:52.050
 in this way this helps me to 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:54.090
 protect the hair from the heat of the 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.309
 plate and I use this tonin here 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:01:00.179
 hen hurry that I like very much 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:03.710
 so the spray and peppino already has 

00:01:00.179 --> 00:01:07.020
 turned on my plate and I use the jtb 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:09.960
 began to create sections with the 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:13.770
 plate help you shrimp nice of the 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:18.750
 cine sections precisely and began to create 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:22.710
 a bush said here the plate closes e 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:27.810
 He began to turn on itself 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:32.850
 ok and then latin down and pulled her down of 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:36.829
 new always spinning I will get a kind 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.829
 of what of this kind 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:51.420
 the size of the sections you decide 

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:53.909
 you can take more pieces 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.880
 small pieces of hair or pieces a 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:02:00.079
 bigger as you see I am not 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.079
 still very practical 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:25.140
 I'm all doing it outside 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:27.599
 but someone I do also towards 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:30.230
 the interior therefore practically change 

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:34.140
 direction of rotation 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:37.590
 this one will come inwards 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:46.040
 because they are not able ok that I have it 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:49.200
 never do I always do so so that 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:52.109
 by cooling form well and keep 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:54.569
 more because obviously the bocolo is done e 

00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:59.750
 holds when it cools down if it 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:59.750
 Untie that while it is still hot, it melts 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:19.470
 this is the result I get 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:20.430
 practically making the ringlets with the 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:22.470
 plate 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:25.800
 if you like it you can leave it like that 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:29.030
 obviously I do it in a little bit but me 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:32.090
 sincerely for the part above 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:34.470
 I prefer another type of business then 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:37.200
 change tool those who follow me more 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:39.510
 time knows that I love this iron of 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:42.300
 remington a number code I never remember 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:45.290
 but I write it in the info box or if so 

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:47.280
 the temperature 190 is sufficient 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:50.700
 I practically just have to play the part 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:55.739
 above so I take what is 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:57.930
 above and began to roll them up 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:04:04.580
 this way maybe inside 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:04.580
 in the frame, wait a little while 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:11.010
 the wave that is created is different from that 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:13.410
 which creates the plate and then the part 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:17.010
 above I like best so it also gives me 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:20.160
 more volume I noticed this thing here and 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:22.459
 the part above the ruotolo all towards 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.459
 the outside 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:39.190
 once they have cooled down that 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:43.919
 that they are fine and then decide whether to do 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:47.680
 but some other mouth seems to me that 

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:50.110
 the result is satisfying now 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:53.139
 what I do depends on whether I want an effect 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:55.449
 nice soft I apply a few drops of 

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:58.150
 oil on your hands 

00:04:55.449 --> 00:05:00.729
 I really see a hot spray 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:04.630
 well and do so on the tips 

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:07.330
 otherwise I use a salt spray 

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:10.120
 my favorite is the spread set of dolls 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:13.570
 now I'm using bamboo and it shows though 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:15.010
 I'm using the surf infusion it seems to 

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:15.790
 bubble doll say that her 

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:19.210
 brother 

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:21.639
 if you have more hair if who is this 

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:24.490
 here is a kind of biphasic indeed it goes 

00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:26.650
 shaken is always a nasal spray but 

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:29.830
 contains oils that go a little bit 

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:34.740
 to make the hair a little softer 

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:38.080
 ostrich and I do this movement 

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:40.060
 very nice right there goes by 

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:43.870
 rubbing and this gives me a nice 

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:46.479
 beach effect with me for the summer is 

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:49.360
 fantastic when spring comes 

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:52.090
 It begins an instant hot defended 

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:55.720
 own dependent on these products at 

00:05:52.090 --> 00:06:00.130
 salt to fix everything sprinkle a little 

00:05:55.720 --> 00:06:02.590
 lacquer this is the method with which i 

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:05.740
 I do this kind of waves of course it is 

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:09.340
 longer to do however known that 

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:11.200
 the effect lasts longer and the next day 

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:13.120
 so I will tomorrow when I wake up 

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:14.979
 own hair even more beautiful 

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:17.530
 in my opinion because they are less less 

00:06:14.979 --> 00:06:20.200
 set but not only this iron here is 

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:22.680
 I notice that after a while the snot is 

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:26.590
 collapses and gives me a beautiful effect 

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:28.930
 however removed but you see it in all 

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:31.690
 video usually do my hair only 

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:34.030
 with iron I sometimes do this 

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:36.580
 procedure when more time when 

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:39.310
 not want a different bush though 

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:39.940
 I always do it because I don't have much time 

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:42.670
 and then 

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:44.950
 mind use multiple product cases because 

00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:47.920
 however you must first use the plate e 

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:50.080
 then fair sibello method result cool 

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:51.850
 but not always to do I hope that 

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:54.520
 you enjoyed this video 

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:59.100
 put a nice like if it was useful 

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:59.100
 and we'll see the next video bye
