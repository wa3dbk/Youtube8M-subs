00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
very disappointing but I don't think

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.959 
very disappointing but I don't think
it's<00:01:57.780> the<00:01:57.990> end<00:01:58.170> that<00:01:58.890> was<00:01:59.130> one<00:01:59.340> reason<00:01:59.369> maybe

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
it's the end that was one reason maybe

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.420 
it's the end that was one reason maybe
we<00:02:00.240> could<00:02:00.420> be<00:02:00.509> playing<00:02:00.869> as<00:02:01.110> Maxis<00:02:01.770> maybe

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
we could be playing as Maxis maybe

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.880 
we could be playing as Maxis maybe
finally<00:02:03.000> after<00:02:03.479> like<00:02:03.630> three<00:02:04.140> call<00:02:04.590> duty

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
finally after like three call duty

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.760 
finally after like three call duty
zombie<00:02:05.430> games<00:02:05.670> maybe<00:02:06.630> we<00:02:06.869> can<00:02:07.049> be<00:02:07.200> playing<00:02:07.590> as

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
zombie games maybe we can be playing as

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.270 
zombie games maybe we can be playing as
Samantha<00:02:08.429> and<00:02:08.610> Richthofen<00:02:09.450> as<00:02:09.599> the<00:02:09.929> kid

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
Samantha and Richthofen as the kid

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.960 
Samantha and Richthofen as the kid
versions<00:02:11.280> the<00:02:11.580> smaller<00:02:12.030> kid<00:02:12.450> version

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
versions the smaller kid version

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:16.440 
versions the smaller kid version
or<00:02:13.770> maybe<00:02:14.770> we<00:02:15.250> could<00:02:15.580> be<00:02:15.760> playing<00:02:16.180> as

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
or maybe we could be playing as

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:19.200 
or maybe we could be playing as
Samantha's<00:02:17.350> mother<00:02:17.620> which<00:02:18.430> we<00:02:18.640> have<00:02:18.880> never

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
even seen or heard of at all in the

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
black ops and world at war zombies

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:26.040 
black ops and world at war zombies
storyline<00:02:24.940> that<00:02:25.240> would<00:02:25.540> be<00:02:25.690> pretty<00:02:25.930> cool

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 
storyline that would be pretty cool

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:28.470 
storyline that would be pretty cool
another<00:02:27.010> thing<00:02:27.370> that<00:02:27.400> I<00:02:27.580> think<00:02:27.730> this<00:02:28.060> poster

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
another thing that I think this poster

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.560 
another thing that I think this poster
has<00:02:28.660> in<00:02:28.900> relevance<00:02:29.380> with<00:02:29.560> the<00:02:29.710> black<00:02:29.980> ops<00:02:30.220> 3

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
has in relevance with the black ops 3

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:33.480 
has in relevance with the black ops 3
black<00:02:31.570> ops<00:02:31.780> 3<00:02:31.930> confirmation<00:02:32.740> it's<00:02:33.310> just

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:33.490 
black ops 3 confirmation it's just

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:35.220 
black ops 3 confirmation it's just
basically<00:02:33.970> that<00:02:34.270> it<00:02:34.360> says<00:02:34.570> join<00:02:34.840> us<00:02:34.990> on<00:02:35.140> the
