00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.140
 good hdblog friends is a challenge to 

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:11.019
 four the one we are shooting with a 

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:15.010
 our super support indeed we have the 

00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:17.820
 samsung galaxy s 6 rs6 flat iphone 6 e 

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:22.359
 htc one and minus the top-end sufferings 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:25.149
 up to now, videos have been released at 1080p on 

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:27.579
 all on all four we find the pan 

00:00:25.149 --> 00:00:29.769
 fast here we try a lot of recovery 

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:30.729
 very contrasted 

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:33.610
 now we can take our walk 

00:00:30.729 --> 00:00:35.140
 I'm very careful about how 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:37.540
 I will walk just to evaluate the 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:40.000
 image stabilization concern 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:41.410
 very badly they think I'm crazy 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.820
 because I will show with that it has its own 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:46.390
 I'm around you see it reflected here 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:51.430
 in the screen, sorry in the doorway 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:54.400
 we enter the revival door 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:56.730
 decidedly weaker than having 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:58.829
 four phones that are running 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.150
 in parallel you can also evaluate 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:04.089
 looking first at one video then the other at 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:07.659
 audio quality in various phones 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:13.299
 let's open the elevator of fear look 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:15.520
 hi i'm really ridiculous though for 

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:19.299
 evaluate the performance of the 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:21.579
 video camera that lives there are not 

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:23.619
 all perfectly on the same axis 

00:01:21.579 --> 00:01:25.719
 so maybe the recovery won't be 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:27.729
 just perfectly equal on all 

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:29.219
 four majesty phones made in the 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:32.350
 same lighting conditions 

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:33.030
 that is a darkness almost pesto in this 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:36.249
 lift 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:39.069
 now we wait for the doors to open 

00:01:36.249 --> 00:01:41.259
 to come on the basis of the light and evaluate 

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:44.950
 the speed of adaptation to light la 

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:46.479
 brightness and fire color and then 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:51.039
 we will try one at a time because I don't have 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:52.959
 four hands zoom on the leather towers 

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:58.320
 what are we about to open? 

00:01:52.959 --> 00:02:01.690
 the elevator ready to light, here it is 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:06.520
 so consider yourself adapting to the 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:09.040
 brightness now I turn around I stop I try 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:11.710
 first with and we know how to zoom in to me 

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:15.940
 stopped at 4 for even if it reaches up to 8 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:20.890
 lost to edge both flat ds6 here it is 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:26.950
 now zumbo with iphone made and zummo 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:31.570
 also with m9 I repeat video that I shot 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:36.190
 in parallel from flat to 0 and if you are 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:40.110
 back to 0 iphone 6 back to zero and m9 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:40.110
 back to 0
