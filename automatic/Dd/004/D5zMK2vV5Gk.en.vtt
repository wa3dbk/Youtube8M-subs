00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:07.270
 today a message came out from 

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:08.799
 feyenoord about the collaboration with 

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:11.589
 martijn krabbendam journalist from ve 

00:00:08.799 --> 00:00:13.959
 with which you as players of feyenoord 

00:00:11.589 --> 00:00:15.610
 have no contact go 

00:00:13.959 --> 00:00:17.770
 why is that actually we have 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:19.330
 a few weeks ago we have 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:21.189
 had group discussions with the 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:23.140
 selection with the players on 

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:25.060
 about the coming season 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:26.439
 certain agreements that we always have 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:27.580
 together 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:30.699
 and that conversation has emerged 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:32.290
 that we actually trust it 

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:34.630
 martijn krabbendam are lost 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:36.700
 compared to giving and making 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:39.040
 interviews are various agreements 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:40.660
 violated such that the group 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.370
 has decided to 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:45.460
 Jan to give him no more interviews 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:46.840
 and that is a sad fact but the fact 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:48.940
 that we do that is of course not for 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:51.220
 nothing one and it is also something the 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:53.560
 entire selection has been behind 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:55.570
 we all have one 

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:57.430
 letter we signed to the editors 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:00.460
 of cattle have let us know that we too 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:03.130
 let us know that we just do better 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.750
 is they will stand and and me 

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:06.970
 I also personally informed Martijn 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.890
 why we did that and yes that 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:10.150
 that is sad but we could 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.280
 yes no other decision at this time 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:14.050
 did you ever take him as 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.970
 Feyenoord player had to do 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:18.490
 i have worked with martijn for years and 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:20.080
 he is also a good one 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:21.430
 I also told journalists 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.560
 only the things he last 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:26.080
 years at feyenoord 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.970
 violated such agreements which 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.820
 yes for us to a situation 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:32.320
 led and also to myself that I think yes 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:33.909
 you have experienced as I say 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.930
 that I just thought it was a shame and not 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:36.220
 found necessary 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:37.870
 what kind of things are we going me 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.020
 as for myself than an example 

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:40.939
 call that me 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.850
 yes a great interview with him minister 

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:44.990
 had a great piece with him 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:49.369
 had an appointment 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:51.500
 made to feyenoord not too much 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:53.479
 absolutely no no it 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.039
 to use leaders and then completely 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:56.719
 not be on the cover of a friend 

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:58.280
 and if you then yes yes beautiful 

00:01:56.719 --> 00:02:00.079
 make an interview appointment 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.340
 I check that interview myself and then 

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:03.350
 then that me 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:06.709
 pontifically on the yes on the cover of 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:08.119
 four stand and that I am completely crazy 

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:09.739
 am from feyenoord 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:11.959
 yes that is also just the deal 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:13.849
 was made not to do that 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:16.280
 just to fully focus on it 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:18.140
 fenerbahçe at the time and yes that kind 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.970
 things have happened several times 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.319
 several times with multiple players and 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.390
 it's a shame we made this decision 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:24.160
 had to take but we have that 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:27.170
 done 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:29.510
 as a group of players and now the 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.799
 We suggested that we do that 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:32.810
 have done on behalf of the management but 

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:34.549
 this is independent of the management 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:35.900
 we have done this as players yes 

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:37.519
 more also says it is widely supported 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.470
 by the players then it is crazy that 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:41.450
 for example players like bitches or 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:42.950
 clasie have not left the club or 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:44.660
 with extensive stories again with kerber 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.040
 then in those v that stand 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.049
 well we have in 7 what we have the 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.780
 I have stood for the group myself 

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:52.940
 and I asked all players or 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:54.260
 they were behind it and everyone was allowed 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:56.209
 share his own opinion at a time 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.769
 that the players we are the not behind 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:59.840
 to send this letter how 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:01.430
 she said not to put a signature or 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.870
 could they tell the distance how 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:05.299
 absolutely no problem because everyone 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:07.190
 must ultimately know for themselves 

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:09.799
 and also jordi and and john-paul have there 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:11.329
 carried on so why did she jawadde 

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:12.920
 have now returned from that decision 

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:14.870
 you should ask that yourself now 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:16.489
 thereby deciding on which you are none 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:18.049
 come and watch from the leadership of 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:19.910
 feyenoord no absolutely not 

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:21.620
 and again what I want 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:23.359
 I have no trouble with that 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:25.340
 that we are being approached critically 

00:03:23.359 --> 00:03:27.200
 it is more logical 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:28.639
 that that build now he that 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:31.069
 feyenoord the people who have something too 

00:03:28.639 --> 00:03:32.900
 be critical then but keep out 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:34.190
 no but that will be that it is me 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:36.260
 absolutely disagree because it goes 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:38.750
 not about the criticism it's about the way 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:41.720
 how the criticism is given and and and the 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:43.340
 yes the many untruths that those about us 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:45.319
 be written and that is the case 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:47.000
 martijn, and I find that we 

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:48.859
 I think I should have done that 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.870
 we have no other media outside the 

00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:51.680
 door and again v that is 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:53.870
 further welcome 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:55.729
 because 2 is a large leaf serves the 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:57.290
 large part of your followers 

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:59.660
 yes , you should not have those 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:01.310
 Exclude seems to me but we have too 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:03.199
 nothing against two 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:04.970
 as if as feyenoord there are no and 

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:07.340
 also if if players are not it is 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:09.079
 just certain agreements with 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:11.209
 journalists make an interview like you 

00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:12.979
 and at the time you make appointments 

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:14.600
 that means that he has not fulfilled 

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:16.009
 and not met several times 

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:17.930
 if yes then you lose it 

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:19.280
 trust each other and that's what here 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:21.109
 happened and again I find it 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:22.490
 a shame because it is quite a big one 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:23.840
 city ​​what we had to do but we 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:26.479
 found we couldn't find another way out 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:28.850
 also find what they are not possible to like 

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:30.289
 great people look at each other and too 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:31.400
 we say this in a different way 

00:04:30.289 --> 00:04:33.229
 to resolve 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:34.910
 well then then then it will 

00:04:33.229 --> 00:04:37.759
 initially from martijn himself 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:39.110
 must come than they now determined 

00:04:37.759 --> 00:04:40.669
 indicates things as they are not 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:44.150
 I walked that I think that's a pity 

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:45.560
 because there is a bit of trust what 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:47.870
 lost by either team compared 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:50.570
 from martijn ja and if he wanted to 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:52.070
 then he would restore that 

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:55.039
 that with me with with the players 

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:56.090
 and and not via the media 

00:04:55.039 --> 00:04:58.160
 you would almost forget it but this 

00:04:56.090 --> 00:05:00.199
 the competition will start this weekend 

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:01.370
 against your old club FC Utrecht 

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:03.530
 you don't have a very bender and the 

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:05.090
 preparation had which is not an 

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:06.949
 distraction maneuver anyway 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:09.080
 besides he would almost forget this is 

00:05:06.949 --> 00:05:10.970
 just something that is unrelated to 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:13.699
 eh from what it's all about and we 

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:15.160
 have the focus entirely on us 

00:05:13.699 --> 00:05:17.200
 lie on utrecht and 

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:19.090
 well what is just about criticism there is 

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:20.530
 none more critical than than us on 

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:21.250
 this moment because at its absolute no 

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:23.170
 satisfied 

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:24.550
 the way we do the last two 

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:26.350
 competitions we have performed 

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:28.150
 keen on that 

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:29.860
 yes for the contrary 

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:31.240
 to prove in and up the line 

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:33.280
 and we are all there too 

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:34.990
 convinced that we can do that and 

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:36.220
 then we will train the keyser this week 

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:37.870
 we just had a very good training 

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:40.210
 behind me and i have all there 

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:42.280
 we still have a bit of faith 

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:43.570
 but one thing is important 

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:45.850
 And that is that we have the three points inside 

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:48.270
 catch on Saturday against Utrecht and 

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:48.270
 from there on
