00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
too hard you got veins popping out of

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.760 
too hard you got veins popping out of
your<00:01:44.189> neck<00:01:44.520> and<00:01:45.060> and<00:01:45.530> you<00:01:46.530> know<00:01:46.619> you're

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
your neck and and you know you're

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.469 
your neck and and you know you're
exhausted<00:01:47.280> after<00:01:47.430> your<00:01:47.520> workout<00:01:47.850> that's<00:01:48.149> over

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
exhausted after your workout that's over

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.179 
exhausted after your workout that's over
stressing<00:01:48.720> your<00:01:48.899> adrenal<00:01:49.290> glands<00:01:49.500> so<00:01:50.040> you<00:01:50.100> got

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
stressing your adrenal glands so you got

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.969 
stressing your adrenal glands so you got
to<00:01:50.280> really<00:01:50.460> learn<00:01:50.909> how<00:01:50.939> to<00:01:51.210> train<00:01:51.680> smarter<00:01:52.680> and

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
to really learn how to train smarter and

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.880 
to really learn how to train smarter and
not<00:01:53.040> harder<00:01:53.729> sometimes<00:01:54.710> especially<00:01:55.710> those

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
not harder sometimes especially those

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.080 
not harder sometimes especially those
who<00:01:56.070> already<00:01:56.250> have<00:01:56.399> metabolic<00:01:56.729> derangement

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
who already have metabolic derangement

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.990 
who already have metabolic derangement
so<00:01:58.079> it's<00:01:58.770> kind<00:01:59.070> of<00:01:59.100> like<00:01:59.250> that's<00:01:59.490> the<00:01:59.700> subject

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
so it's kind of like that's the subject

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.569 
so it's kind of like that's the subject
if<00:02:00.750> you<00:02:01.049> have<00:02:01.290> metabolic<00:02:01.619> derangement<00:02:02.070> and

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
if you have metabolic derangement and

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.190 
if you have metabolic derangement and
