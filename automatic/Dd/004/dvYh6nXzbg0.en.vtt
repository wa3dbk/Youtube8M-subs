Hi, Tina Spindler, Gardeniere here.

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:09.120
I've got a really fun
project that the whole family will want do today.

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.150
We talk a lot about gardening and
planting and

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.219
getting everything in the garden, but one
of the things we can't forget to do

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:18.840
is to label the plants that we're
planting.

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.920
This is especially important when you're planting seeds.

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:25.000
Having a label that tells you the type of seed

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.029
and also the date that you planted it is a
really good idea.

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:34.220
Another reason that you want to label
is if you plant several varieties of one plant.

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:40.440
So we've got some great opportunities here to do some really fun projects creating labels.

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.399
Of course the first one that we can do

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:47.059
is to just buy some store-bought labels
and just use a label maker

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:51.120
to go ahead and make the name of the plant on there.

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.800
These are actually reusable so I can
tear those off and put a new label on from season to season.

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.940
But if you want to get a little more creative

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.360
there's a lot of other options.

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:05.020
This is one of my favorite ones for a kitchen garden.

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:07.020
Use some kitchen utensils.

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:10.200
On this one we've just simply taken a
wooden spoon

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.880
an indelible marker and written the name of the herb,

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.620
and maybe even draw a little diagram,
a picture of it. Pretty.

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:21.380
If you go to the craft store you can get these

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.800
die-cut wooden forms and then by just using

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:29.490
a chopstick and a glue gun to attach the
form to the chopstick

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.320
you can have a lot of fun painting
and decorating these forms

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:37.880
and then finally writing the name your
plant on the label.

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.840
Here's an option that is no cost at all

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.380
Find a few sticks or twigs

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.740
use a little pocket knife, something for
the grown ups to do,

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.200
to shave off a flat edge on the twig

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.880
and then go ahead and write in indelible
marker the name of the plant on the stick.

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.620
Now I've done some at a couple of
different sizes

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:01.880
because if I have pots that I want to
label

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.350
a little short stick would be
appropriate.

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.680
But if I'm gonna plant some basil in the garden where it's going to get quite tall

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:12.940
I want a nice long stick so that that
label is still visible as the plant grows.

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:17.920
The final choice that we have is to go ahead and just use colored duct tape.

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.190
These are super simple to create. You
just take a piece

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.400
of the duct tape and you just wrap it
around and stick it to itself

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.340
until it's nice and secure.

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.260
And the last step is just to write the
name of your plant on here.

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.340
This one for basil shows that we planted
it on March 1st

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.580
that way I know when to expect that seed
to germinate

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.980
and can estimate when it's going to be time
to plant it out in the garden.

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:47.860
There we have it: all labeled, and I have to say, I like my homemade ones

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:49.710
better than the store bought ones.

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:54.350
Pretty easy project. Gardening so easy, just get out there and do it.
