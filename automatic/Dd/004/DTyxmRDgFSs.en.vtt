00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.049
 to make our rib soup the 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:09.360
 that we have the cooked rib 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:12.300
 We did the calculation there. 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:15.480
 early point already stung in clubs 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:19.580
 Finest macaroni I 've tried for this 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:23.460
 spaghetti and I broke the middle 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:25.019
 finely sliced tomato 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:29.550
 seed without a club 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:32.820
 olive oil, salt and pepper and our 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:35.309
 rib broth that has been here for 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:39.090
 cites that the complete recipe is just to enter 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.809

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.170
 youtube 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:48.899
 So let's start here by ascending 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:54.350
 there like that and let's strengthened in 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:57.989
 our rib club or bray 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:01:00.739
 It quickly takes a long time to travel. 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.739
 O 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:13.790
 warmed the rib I already entered with the 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:13.790
 leek stirring well 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:28.479
 the broth really catch the sweet 

00:01:26.079 --> 00:01:31.869
 now garlic so what I need to do 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:34.090

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:37.960

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:41.369
 thing now here add the caudal 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:43.840
 Fast frying can not get dark. 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:46.679
 can not darken eye for men 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.679
 because she can not burn 

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:51.850
 We are working the broth of 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:02:00.340
 cost is a clear broth and it is 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:02:03.429
 remain clear enough until 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:08.500

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:23.739
 remembering that our car has nothing 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:33.989
 of salt and remembering that we will 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:33.989
 cooking but here pepper a scramble 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:43.840
 Come back here and cook there. 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:46.030
 10 to 15 minutes 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.459

 in our fight ok already cooked the 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:00.370
 sufficient for the garlic to pass 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:03.790
 I like everything out there, you already understand. 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:04.840
 It tastes like a beautiful thing. 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:09.579
 have this here 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:11.319
 so now it's time to put the dough 

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:14.079
 or there how you want but if you like 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:15.910
 it appears or does it already is 

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:17.829
 right on the spoon without work 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:20.079
 So if it's going to work out, there's still 

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:21.549
 Work, she's in this size here. 

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:33.160
 some work then why do we do 

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:35.560
 break again and then move and we 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:39.010
 Let's cook the pasta. 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:41.260
 until very soft, remembering that in the 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:44.230
 The last five minutes have to come in 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:46.480
 the tomato I will not put the tomato will have 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:48.610
 oxygen and cuttings, and only that 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:51.340
 skin of our soup 's tomato 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:53.830
 So we'll leave the tomatoes like this. 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:57.459
 when the dough is already cooked people 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:04:01.269
 for tomato and finish our soup but there 

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:04.420
 a 12 13 minutes for us to our mass 

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:05.800
 It's already cooked then it's time 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:07.600
 time to do what thomaz put 

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:15.060
 tomato is very mature and will not 

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:17.410
 green tomato beverly ripe now 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:20.290
 accelerate what I want to show for 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:23.680
 You here because I use the dough well 

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:27.310
 When you arrive at this time, 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:29.710
 the pasta is already cooked it is thin 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:31.120
 she cooked increased thickened 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:34.000
 still thin 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:34.840
 if you put the fat mass zone is at 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.720
 your taste 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:39.360
 But the daughter gets cooler now she just goes. 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:42.789
 growing growing you serve 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:45.280
 White claims that the exit of the South 

00:04:42.789 --> 00:04:48.550
 then the tomato here with the tomato is the 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:51.850
 next is just boiled cap leave the fire 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:54.100
 It's going to be high and I'm going to take it 

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:55.510
 To serve that the tomato is to stay. 

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:58.770
 piece 

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:58.770
 so it's boiled already 

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:14.320
 I looked super beautiful for you 

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:16.810

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:20.110

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:22.510

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:30.850
 Give, then, our shadow is ready. 

00:05:28.539 --> 00:05:32.800
 Even for a little green man there is a 

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:37.830
 chives you can put off by 

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:42.100
 little chives will not overdo it 

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:49.140
 mixture that is to contrast the 

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:49.140
 green or tomato and now ready 

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:57.990

00:06:03.919 --> 00:06:12.659

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:27.120
 mouth because what we want is that 

00:06:24.629 --> 00:06:31.490
 You eat well and drink well to be very 

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:31.490
