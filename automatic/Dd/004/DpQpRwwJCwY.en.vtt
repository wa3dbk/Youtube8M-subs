one that was ideal for the answer it

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:17.020 
one that was ideal for the answer it
took<00:02:15.709> me<00:02:15.859> a<00:02:15.890> little<00:02:16.099> bit<00:02:16.250> of<00:02:16.310> time<00:02:16.579> to<00:02:16.790> get<00:02:16.879> the

took me a little bit of time to get the
path<00:02:17.239> right<00:02:17.540> but<00:02:18.109> once<00:02:18.260> you<00:02:18.380> figured<00:02:18.739> out<00:02:18.920> your

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
goal in but if you don't want to

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:24.190 
goal in but if you don't want to

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
necessarily solve things right away you

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:25.839 
necessarily solve things right away you

00:02:25.839 --> 00:02:25.849 
can click on things in the house once

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:28.030 
can click on things in the house once
you<00:02:25.970> actually<00:02:26.150> get<00:02:26.510> inside<00:02:26.900> such<00:02:27.530> as<00:02:27.680> photos

you actually get inside such as photos

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.640 
you actually get inside such as photos

of Lu me and her relatives but there

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.110 
of Lu me and her relatives but there
isn't<00:02:30.950> much<00:02:30.980> freedom<00:02:31.370> as<00:02:31.549> far<00:02:31.819> as<00:02:31.940> that

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
isn't much freedom as far as that

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:33.879 
isn't much freedom as far as that
because<00:02:32.540> you're<00:02:32.690> quickly<00:02:32.959> either<00:02:33.319> collecting

because you're quickly either collecting

00:02:33.889 --> 00:02:36.099 
because you're quickly either collecting

not one hundred percent sure if they

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.370 
not one hundred percent sure if they

after<00:02:43.280> finishing<00:02:43.639> the<00:02:43.970> game's<00:02:44.209> main<00:02:44.510> story

after finishing the game's main story

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.720 
after finishing the game's main story
you're<00:02:45.200> told<00:02:45.440> that<00:02:45.530> more<00:02:45.919> chapters<00:02:46.400> lie<00:02:46.609> ahead

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730 
you're told that more chapters lie ahead

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:54.690 
you're told that more chapters lie ahead
or<00:02:47.150> maybe<00:02:47.810> will<00:02:48.079> lie<00:02:48.230> ahead

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:58.110 

I<00:02:55.349> can<00:02:56.349> only<00:02:56.560> hope<00:02:56.739> there<00:02:57.220> are<00:02:57.310> more<00:02:57.340> because

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
I can only hope there are more because

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.690 
I can only hope there are more because
it<00:02:58.270> was<00:02:58.390> by<00:02:58.599> far<00:02:58.629> one<00:02:59.590> of<00:02:59.650> my<00:02:59.800> favorite<00:03:00.310> indie

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
it was by far one of my favorite indie

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.530 
it was by far one of my favorite indie
games<00:03:00.940> from<00:03:01.450> my<00:03:01.569> pc<00:03:01.959> that<00:03:02.140> i<00:03:02.170> own<00:03:02.590> to<00:03:02.890> date<00:03:03.099> i

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
games from my pc that i own to date i

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.940 
games from my pc that i own to date i
think<00:03:04.540> mostly<00:03:04.900> because<00:03:05.140> of<00:03:05.319> the<00:03:05.470> art<00:03:05.680> style

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
think mostly because of the art style

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:08.130 
think mostly because of the art style
being<00:03:06.250> so<00:03:06.519> unique<00:03:06.879> and<00:03:07.150> on<00:03:07.629> top<00:03:07.840> of<00:03:07.900> everything

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
being so unique and on top of everything

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:10.470 
being so unique and on top of everything
in<00:03:08.560> this<00:03:08.650> game<00:03:08.920> it<00:03:09.310> uses<00:03:09.580> the<00:03:09.879> whole<00:03:10.060> going

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
in this game it uses the whole going

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.390 
in this game it uses the whole going
green<00:03:10.780> theme<00:03:11.080> and<00:03:11.380> tries<00:03:11.890> to<00:03:11.920> invoke<00:03:12.340> a

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
green theme and tries to invoke a

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.089 
green theme and tries to invoke a
message<00:03:12.910> to<00:03:13.150> conserve<00:03:13.540> energy<00:03:14.099> beautiful

00:03:15.089 --> 00:03:15.099 
message to conserve energy beautiful

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:17.280 
message to conserve energy beautiful
