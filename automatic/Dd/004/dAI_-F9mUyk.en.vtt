some quick features like adjusting the

has<00:02:14.060> never<00:02:14.330> been<00:02:14.660> phenomenal<00:02:15.590> and<00:02:15.740> if<00:02:16.130> I<00:02:16.220> was

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
has never been phenomenal and if I was

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.760 
has never been phenomenal and if I was
honest<00:02:16.820> I<00:02:16.970> always<00:02:17.510> thought<00:02:17.660> a<00:02:17.720> bell<00:02:18.110> or<00:02:18.320> Giro

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:18.770

helmet<00:02:19.190> fit<00:02:19.610> my<00:02:19.790> head<00:02:20.030> a<00:02:20.240> little<00:02:20.660> better<00:02:20.810> and

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.050 
helmet fit my head a little better and

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:23.320 
helmet fit my head a little better and
that<00:02:21.620> was<00:02:21.740> probably<00:02:21.950> the<00:02:22.340> one<00:02:22.760> complaint<00:02:23.210> I

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.330 
that was probably the one complaint I

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:25.600 
that was probably the one complaint I
had<00:02:23.510> along<00:02:24.140> with<00:02:24.260> the<00:02:24.350> fact<00:02:24.560> that<00:02:24.680> the<00:02:25.340> Euro

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
had along with the fact that the Euro

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:27.910 
had along with the fact that the Euro
weight<00:02:25.910> was<00:02:26.420> so<00:02:26.630> much<00:02:26.810> lighter<00:02:27.140> than<00:02:27.620> what<00:02:27.800> we

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
weight was so much lighter than what we

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.290 
weight was so much lighter than what we
got<00:02:28.040> stateside<00:02:29.380> enter<00:02:30.400> the<00:02:31.400> ultralight<00:02:31.880> plus

when<00:02:33.200> I<00:02:33.230> first<00:02:33.530> saw<00:02:33.710> the<00:02:33.770> pictures<00:02:34.250> of<00:02:34.400> this

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
when I first saw the pictures of this

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:36.550 
when I first saw the pictures of this
before<00:02:35.390> it<00:02:35.450> was<00:02:35.540> officially<00:02:35.630> released<00:02:35.990> I

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
before it was officially released I

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.310 
before it was officially released I
thought<00:02:37.100> wow<00:02:37.730> is<00:02:38.540> that<00:02:38.690> a<00:02:38.720> race<00:02:38.960> car<00:02:39.170> that

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:39.320 
thought wow is that a race car that

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:40.150 
thought wow is that a race car that
should<00:02:39.470> have<00:02:39.650> wheels

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.160 
should have wheels

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:41.860 
should have wheels
the<00:02:40.610> little<00:02:40.820> spoiler<00:02:41.240> on<00:02:41.360> the<00:02:41.390> back<00:02:41.510> was

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
the little spoiler on the back was

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.110 
the little spoiler on the back was
honestly<00:02:42.260> a<00:02:42.560> little<00:02:43.130> distracting<00:02:43.820> for<00:02:44.030> me

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
honestly a little distracting for me

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.850 
honestly a little distracting for me
when<00:02:44.300> I<00:02:44.360> first<00:02:44.660> saw<00:02:44.960> it<00:02:45.020> I<00:02:45.230> thought<00:02:45.440> it<00:02:45.770> was

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:45.860 
when I first saw it I thought it was

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:48.130 
when I first saw it I thought it was
intended<00:02:46.160> to<00:02:46.280> be<00:02:46.400> a<00:02:46.430> handle<00:02:47.240> to<00:02:47.660> help<00:02:47.840> you<00:02:47.930> pick

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
intended to be a handle to help you pick

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:50.410 
intended to be a handle to help you pick
the<00:02:48.170> helmet<00:02:48.560> up<00:02:48.710> but<00:02:49.580> Lamar<00:02:49.820> tells<00:02:50.120> me<00:02:50.270> it's

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
the helmet up but Lamar tells me it's

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.690 
the helmet up but Lamar tells me it's
designed<00:02:50.870> to<00:02:51.080> pull<00:02:51.650> the<00:02:51.740> airflow<00:02:52.190> off<00:02:52.430> the

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
designed to pull the airflow off the

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.180 
designed to pull the airflow off the
back<00:02:52.850> of<00:02:52.880> your<00:02:53.060> head<00:02:53.390> and<00:02:53.870> I<00:02:54.590> must<00:02:54.830> say<00:02:55.010> it

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190 
back of your head and I must say it

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:57.460 
back of your head and I must say it
probably<00:02:55.730> does<00:02:56.300> that<00:02:56.540> but<00:02:57.050> because<00:02:57.200> the

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470 
probably does that but because the

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:59.980 
probably does that but because the
helmets<00:02:57.830> so<00:02:58.010> airy<00:02:58.370> I<00:02:58.640> can't<00:02:59.270> really<00:02:59.480> tell<00:02:59.930> the

00:02:59.980 --> 00:02:59.990 
helmets so airy I can't really tell the

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:02.050 
helmets so airy I can't really tell the
difference<00:03:00.110> between<00:03:00.530> this<00:03:00.830> little<00:03:01.060> addition

here<00:03:02.270> it<00:03:03.260> does<00:03:03.740> look<00:03:04.040> very<00:03:04.070> Boy<00:03:05.030> Wonder

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:17.530 
manage to do is address my two
complaints<00:03:15.920> they've<00:03:16.760> got<00:03:16.970> the<00:03:17.120> weight<00:03:17.330> down

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:17.540 
complaints they've got the weight down

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:20.440 
complaints they've got the weight down
now<00:03:18.460> 215<00:03:19.460> grams<00:03:19.490> which<00:03:20.060> is<00:03:20.090> interestingly

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:20.450 
now 215 grams which is interestingly

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:23.500 
now 215 grams which is interestingly
enough<00:03:20.930> the<00:03:21.530> Euro<00:03:21.860> weight<00:03:22.160> for<00:03:22.580> the<00:03:22.670> pro<00:03:22.850> 104

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:23.510 
enough the Euro weight for the pro 104

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:27.780 
enough the Euro weight for the pro 104
and<00:03:24.340> the<00:03:25.340> fit<00:03:25.760> is<00:03:25.970> now<00:03:26.390> a<00:03:26.630> little<00:03:27.020> bit<00:03:27.140> better

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790 
and the fit is now a little bit better

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:32.080 
and the fit is now a little bit better
whereas<00:03:28.790> this<00:03:29.120> was<00:03:29.360> maybe<00:03:29.540> a<00:03:29.780> 70%<00:03:30.440> I<00:03:31.090> think

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.090 
whereas this was maybe a 70% I think

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:35.050 
whereas this was maybe a 70% I think
this<00:03:32.210> is<00:03:32.360> now<00:03:32.510> an<00:03:32.690> 85<00:03:33.110> or<00:03:33.380> 90<00:03:33.890> percenter<00:03:34.280> the

this is now an 85 or 90 percenter the

fit around my head it covers just a

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:40.180 
fit around my head it covers just a

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.190 
little bit more and it sits on my head a

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:42.860 
little bit nicer the difference isn't

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:45.640 
little bit nicer the difference isn't
night<00:03:43.490> and<00:03:43.700> day<00:03:43.910> but<00:03:44.420> more<00:03:44.660> refinement<00:03:45.560> on

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:45.650 
night and day but more refinement on

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:48.040 
night and day but more refinement on
something<00:03:46.040> that<00:03:46.160> I<00:03:46.190> already<00:03:46.910> enjoyed<00:03:47.390> but

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:48.050 
something that I already enjoyed but

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:49.510 
something that I already enjoyed but
thought<00:03:48.350> it<00:03:48.380> was<00:03:48.620> weak<00:03:48.800> in<00:03:49.010> a<00:03:49.100> certain<00:03:49.400> area

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:49.520 
thought it was weak in a certain area

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:51.750 
thought it was weak in a certain area
and<00:03:49.850> they've<00:03:50.450> managed<00:03:50.780> to<00:03:50.870> do<00:03:51.050> that<00:03:51.260> here<00:03:51.470> I

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
and they've managed to do that here I

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:55.480 
and they've managed to do that here I
could<00:03:52.760> do<00:03:53.000> without<00:03:53.240> the<00:03:53.450> spoiler<00:03:53.810> I'm<00:03:54.500> Rob<00:03:55.250> if
