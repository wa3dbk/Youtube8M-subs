or be able to remove that stem that the

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:04.350 
or be able to remove that stem that the
eggs<00:01:02.260> are<00:01:02.530> on<00:01:02.649> you're<00:01:03.579> way<00:01:03.819> ahead<00:01:03.969> of<00:01:04.119> the<00:01:04.269> game

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:04.360 
eggs are on you're way ahead of the game

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.420 
eggs are on you're way ahead of the game
because<00:01:04.930> that's<00:01:05.110> taken<00:01:05.619> care<00:01:05.649> of<00:01:05.979> the<00:01:06.130> squash

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:06.430 
because that's taken care of the squash

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:08.639 
because that's taken care of the squash
before<00:01:06.969> it<00:01:07.180> even<00:01:07.360> shows<00:01:07.659> up<00:01:07.689> so<00:01:08.229> we're<00:01:08.409> getting

00:01:08.639 --> 00:01:08.649 
before it even shows up so we're getting

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:10.950 
before it even shows up so we're getting
rid<00:01:08.799> of<00:01:08.890> it<00:01:09.009> that<00:01:09.219> way<00:01:09.430> if<00:01:10.270> you<00:01:10.479> don't<00:01:10.659> catch

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:10.960 
rid of it that way if you don't catch

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:12.600 
rid of it that way if you don't catch
them<00:01:11.140> early<00:01:11.320> enough<00:01:11.649> then<00:01:11.950> they<00:01:12.100> will<00:01:12.250> go<00:01:12.369> into

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:12.610 
them early enough then they will go into

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:15.539 
them early enough then they will go into
the<00:01:13.030> nymph<00:01:13.600> stage<00:01:14.020> where<00:01:14.380> they're<00:01:14.619> just<00:01:15.430> the

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:15.549 
the nymph stage where they're just the

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:18.179 
the nymph stage where they're just the
young<00:01:15.820> is<00:01:16.060> newly<00:01:16.299> hatched<00:01:16.689> they<00:01:17.200> will<00:01:17.409> crawl

00:01:18.179 --> 00:01:18.189 
young is newly hatched they will crawl

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:19.889 
young is newly hatched they will crawl
out<00:01:18.399> and<00:01:18.520> be<00:01:18.640> crawling<00:01:19.090> all<00:01:19.240> over<00:01:19.270> the<00:01:19.600> plant

00:01:19.889 --> 00:01:19.899 
out and be crawling all over the plant

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:21.810 
out and be crawling all over the plant
if<00:01:20.200> you<00:01:20.680> are<00:01:20.859> going<00:01:21.039> to<00:01:21.100> use<00:01:21.310> an<00:01:21.490> insecticide

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:21.820 
if you are going to use an insecticide

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:24.719 
if you are going to use an insecticide
whether<00:01:22.509> it's<00:01:22.719> organic<00:01:22.930> or<00:01:23.439> inorganic<00:01:23.729> that

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:24.729 
whether it's organic or inorganic that

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:26.849 
whether it's organic or inorganic that
is<00:01:24.939> a<00:01:24.969> good<00:01:25.240> time<00:01:25.509> to<00:01:25.689> use<00:01:25.930> the<00:01:26.170> insecticide

00:01:26.849 --> 00:01:26.859 
is a good time to use the insecticide

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:29.399 
is a good time to use the insecticide
because<00:01:27.340> the<00:01:27.609> young<00:01:27.880> are<00:01:28.060> much<00:01:28.240> easier<00:01:28.270> to<00:01:28.659> to

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:29.409 
because the young are much easier to to

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:31.469 
because the young are much easier to to
kill<00:01:29.590> off<00:01:29.859> than<00:01:30.189> the<00:01:30.340> older<00:01:30.670> adults<00:01:30.939> and<00:01:31.329> then

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:31.479 
kill off than the older adults and then

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:33.499 
kill off than the older adults and then
of<00:01:31.570> course<00:01:31.630> the<00:01:32.020> adults<00:01:32.439> are<00:01:32.590> kind<00:01:32.799> of<00:01:32.859> a

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
of course the adults are kind of a

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.770 
of course the adults are kind of a
brownish<00:01:34.509> color<00:01:34.859> they<00:01:35.859> avoid<00:01:36.820> sunlight<00:01:37.210> so<00:01:37.750> a

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:37.780 
brownish color they avoid sunlight so a

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:39.270 
brownish color they avoid sunlight so a
lot<00:01:38.020> of<00:01:38.109> times<00:01:38.320> you<00:01:38.530> will<00:01:38.679> not<00:01:38.859> see<00:01:39.219> them

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:39.280 
lot of times you will not see them

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:40.740 
lot of times you will not see them
because<00:01:39.549> they'll<00:01:39.880> be<00:01:39.909> hiding<00:01:40.420> on<00:01:40.570> the

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:40.750 
because they'll be hiding on the

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:43.260 
because they'll be hiding on the
undersides<00:01:41.229> of<00:01:41.439> leaves<00:01:41.500> or<00:01:42.009> they'll<00:01:42.999> be<00:01:43.149> on

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:43.270 
undersides of leaves or they'll be on

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:44.940 
undersides of leaves or they'll be on
the<00:01:43.450> back<00:01:43.659> side<00:01:43.689> of<00:01:43.990> the<00:01:44.229> stem<00:01:44.499> when<00:01:44.770> you're

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:44.950 
the back side of the stem when you're

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:48.060 
the back side of the stem when you're
trying<00:01:45.219> to<00:01:45.340> find<00:01:45.579> them<00:01:45.820> so<00:01:46.740> one<00:01:47.740> of<00:01:47.770> the<00:01:47.920> ways

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.070 
trying to find them so one of the ways

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:50.849 
trying to find them so one of the ways
to<00:01:48.460> keep<00:01:48.939> squash<00:01:49.299> bugs<00:01:49.600> off<00:01:49.840> course<00:01:50.259> is<00:01:50.530> to<00:01:50.679> get

00:01:50.849 --> 00:01:50.859 
to keep squash bugs off course is to get

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:54.090 
to keep squash bugs off course is to get
a<00:01:50.890> lot<00:01:51.070> of<00:01:51.280> sunlight<00:01:52.030> reflected<00:01:52.979> people<00:01:53.979> have

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.100 
a lot of sunlight reflected people have

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.429 
a lot of sunlight reflected people have
used<00:01:54.340> aluminum<00:01:54.999> foil<00:01:55.359> mulch<00:01:55.780> to<00:01:56.109> get<00:01:56.289> the

00:01:56.429 --> 00:01:56.439 
used aluminum foil mulch to get the

00:01:56.439 --> 00:01:59.219 
used aluminum foil mulch to get the
light<00:01:56.619> to<00:01:56.890> bounce<00:01:57.039> back<00:01:57.429> up<00:01:57.460> and<00:01:57.960> catch<00:01:58.960> some

00:01:59.219 --> 00:01:59.229 
light to bounce back up and catch some

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:00.690 
light to bounce back up and catch some
of<00:01:59.259> the<00:01:59.409> undersides<00:01:59.859> of<00:02:00.069> leaves<00:02:00.130> and<00:02:00.609> that

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:00.700 
of the undersides of leaves and that

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.910 
of the undersides of leaves and that
does<00:02:00.999> help<00:02:01.210> as<00:02:01.539> the<00:02:01.719> plant's<00:02:02.109> young<00:02:02.380> but<00:02:02.649> as<00:02:02.770> it

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:02.920 
does help as the plant's young but as it

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.730 
does help as the plant's young but as it
gets<00:02:03.069> older<00:02:03.280> and<00:02:03.609> over<00:02:03.819> grows<00:02:04.090> the<00:02:04.479> foil<00:02:05.350> then

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
gets older and over grows the foil then

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:07.230 
gets older and over grows the foil then
the<00:02:05.979> squash<00:02:06.249> bug

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240 
the squash bug

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.770 
the squash bug
does<00:02:07.869> move<00:02:08.170> back<00:02:08.380> in<00:02:08.709> so<00:02:09.450> you<00:02:10.450> want<00:02:10.630> to<00:02:10.690> be

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.780 
does move back in so you want to be

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:12.839 
does move back in so you want to be
careful<00:02:11.170> with<00:02:11.290> that<00:02:11.319> but<00:02:11.800> there<00:02:12.520> are<00:02:12.550> some

00:02:12.839 --> 00:02:12.849 
careful with that but there are some

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:14.790 
careful with that but there are some
insecticides<00:02:13.360> are<00:02:13.810> labeled<00:02:14.290> you<00:02:14.440> want<00:02:14.620> to<00:02:14.680> be

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 
insecticides are labeled you want to be

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.400 
insecticides are labeled you want to be
careful<00:02:15.220> because<00:02:15.340> the<00:02:15.910> squash<00:02:16.810> plant<00:02:17.140> is

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
careful because the squash plant is

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:20.339 
careful because the squash plant is
insect<00:02:18.190> pollinated<00:02:18.790> so<00:02:19.599> if<00:02:19.750> you're<00:02:19.900> using<00:02:20.140> a
