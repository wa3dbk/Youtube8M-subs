00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:05.500
 now we are going to see that here 

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:08.560
 starting from each of our 

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:10.990
 triads we can create two 

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:12.670
 different chords are realities 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:17.010
 different and probably of functions 

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:19.810
 very different adding that we have to 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:22.210
 secure is 1 3 5 and 7 that will be 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:23.680
 working with 1 3 and 5 let's see what 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:25.190
 chords we can derive from our 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:27.330
 coordination 

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:28.920
 the agreed finger older 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:33.200
 was 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:35.800
 1 3 and 5 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.800
 so 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:45.570
 that we feel I can add you can 

00:00:42.429 --> 00:00:45.570
 get to the seventh of salgado 

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:48.530
 one 

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:53.570
 35 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:57.730
 and 7 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:57.730
 I'm going to have a chord of 2 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:05.820
 greater than 7 meters 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:09.800
 but the ears 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.800
 my sun 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:12.600
 and yes 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:20.689
 I remembered that very reality 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.689
 Sophisticated 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:29.479
 the most holy case is used 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:31.340
 few sophisticated or very much in music 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:33.759
 Latin American is observed a lot 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.759
 we have scored 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:41.540
 if we for example think of the 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:46.390
 sun scale 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:46.390
 which are the tape 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:55.560
 has held the accordÃ© of sun of the 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:58.600
 notes only if the F sharp always 13 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:02.830
 5 and 7 of each month 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:04.600
 this chord take seventh of the form 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:06.940
 probably more usual to write the 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:09.190
 to write what you are but there is 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:11.850
 other ways that we're going to 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:14.630
 find as 2 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:14.630
 m 7 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:22.890
 two 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:26.730
 + 7 the risks what you eat 7 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:29.190
 we can write it as 2 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:32.190
 7 m 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:36.060
 and there is a culture that is what is 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:39.680
 taking precedence in the centers 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.680
 academics and what else is 

00:02:43.439 --> 00:02:52.950
 the symbolic writing is greater 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:55.040
 write the concept of a chord has 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:58.150
 the seventh largest 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.150
 what they create with a triangle 

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:06.990
 the other chord that I can derive from 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:06.990
 my seventh finger triad 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:16.050
 they have a formula 1 35 the same triad 

00:03:13.969 --> 00:03:19.340
 higher 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:19.340
 but we feel 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:26.710
 then it is not my sun 

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:30.140
 and if I come 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:37.129
 this difference between all the chords 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:39.640
 is very important for a very reason 

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:39.640
 simple 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:49.500
 everyone calls them all this 

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:51.260
 seventh higher because the error comes 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:55.910
 of our learning process 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:55.910
 we learn for example 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:09.110
 at some point then but logical 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:09.110
 we set 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:16.329
 but in reality the coordination does not 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:18.430
 has functions the forgiveness of 

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:20.500
 programming of chords above have 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:23.389
 very different functions 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:26.560
 or accounts 

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:26.560
 the greatest agreement 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:35.500
 all right 

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:44.440
 and 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:44.440
 I feel like resting 

00:04:51.949 --> 00:04:59.790
 they are a family whose function is 

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:01.800
 generate a little more slope for 

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:06.110
 that is in agreement lead to another place 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:06.110
 I'm going to complete my sequence 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:10.620
 48 

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:34.000
 in exchange for the seventh 

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:34.000
 Y 

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:48.000
 What's up 

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:54.679
 they are so opposite that one 

00:05:52.849 --> 00:05:57.849
 is made purely and exclusively 

00:05:54.679 --> 00:05:57.849
 by the mayor's notes 

00:05:58.249 --> 00:06:03.729
 and another has a note that escapes from 

00:06:01.429 --> 00:06:03.729
 beccar 

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:11.100
 is this difference makes if 

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:12.840
 we use our pumpkin with a 

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:15.240
 structure that indicates consonance 

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:18.980
 it indicates affinity between the sounds 

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:22.610
 this means that the tree has some 

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:25.389
 some note that not that finally 

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:25.389
 we are not going to give 

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:29.610
 d 

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:49.140
 is now very unstable 

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:53.610
 that 

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:58.300
 I do not have relationships in the memories that 

00:06:56.010 --> 00:07:00.819
 they are unstable 

00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:02.919
 start trying to deduce that 

00:07:00.819 --> 00:07:04.300
 stability and instability is what 

00:07:02.919 --> 00:07:07.000
 will allow us to recognize 

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:08.199
 ear chords on one side and on the other 

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.509
 the last two in the case of 

00:07:08.199 --> 00:07:12.400
 advanced improvisation much more 

00:07:10.509 --> 00:07:14.110
 forward we are talking a few more years 

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:16.990
 ahead what we are going to play 

00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:18.849
 is with the stability and instability of 

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:20.490
 the sounds will no longer matter to us every 

00:07:18.849 --> 00:07:22.680
 milestone 

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:24.660
 the structure scales if we 

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:28.470
 we started playing with intuition and the 

00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:29.970
 intuition the basic rule with which 

00:07:28.470 --> 00:07:31.889
 we guide at intuition level 

00:07:29.970 --> 00:07:33.960
 our music is stability and 

00:07:31.889 --> 00:07:36.229
 instability of us we see in the 

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:38.130
 fusion musicians live musicians 

00:07:36.229 --> 00:07:40.259
 very advanced when they are improvising 

00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:42.810
 gives the impression that they escaped 

00:07:40.259 --> 00:07:45.210
 the scale they practically escaped from 

00:07:42.810 --> 00:07:47.849
 the scale but actually because I was 

00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:51.120
 making dominant accor religions 

00:07:47.849 --> 00:07:53.340
 unstable are touching tensions of 

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:55.350
 sound are choosing notes that collide 

00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:58.380
 even more 

00:07:55.350 --> 00:08:00.660
 that that those differences from those friends 

00:07:58.380 --> 00:08:03.410
 that collide and that are inside 

00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:03.410
 of the community
