00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
making to the new force in a shot and I

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.560 
making to the new force in a shot and I
think<00:02:31.590> it's<00:02:31.890> a<00:02:31.980> group<00:02:32.340> we<00:02:33.060> learned<00:02:33.300> a<00:02:33.390> lot<00:02:33.510> from

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:33.570 
think it's a group we learned a lot from

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:36.140 
think it's a group we learned a lot from
each<00:02:33.780> other<00:02:33.959> last<00:02:34.170> year<00:02:34.940> winds<00:02:35.940> are<00:02:36.030> some

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
each other last year winds are some

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.420 
each other last year winds are some
tough<00:02:36.300> times<00:02:36.540> no<00:02:37.440> one<00:02:37.560> ever<00:02:37.680> gave<00:02:37.920> up<00:02:38.190> we

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
tough times no one ever gave up we

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.130 
tough times no one ever gave up we
always<00:02:38.640> tried<00:02:38.970> but<00:02:39.330> things<00:02:39.510> just<00:02:39.570> never

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
always tried but things just never

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.300 
always tried but things just never
seemed<00:02:40.470> to<00:02:40.500> seem<00:02:41.130> to<00:02:41.250> fall<00:02:41.430> in<00:02:41.580> place<00:02:42.209> for<00:02:42.570> us

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
seemed to seem to fall in place for us

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:46.640 
seemed to seem to fall in place for us
so<00:02:44.310> sometimes<00:02:44.670> you<00:02:44.760> have<00:02:44.880> to<00:02:45.050> see<00:02:46.050> it<00:02:46.170> wrong<00:02:46.380> to

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
so sometimes you have to see it wrong to

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.040 
so sometimes you have to see it wrong to
do<00:02:46.770> it<00:02:46.890> right<00:02:47.040> and<00:02:47.310> then<00:02:48.000> you<00:02:48.420> saw<00:02:48.600> wrong<00:02:48.780> last

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 
do it right and then you saw wrong last

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:51.230 
do it right and then you saw wrong last
year
