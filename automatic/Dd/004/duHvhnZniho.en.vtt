September where we were trying to work
out<00:01:44.729> and<00:01:44.909> get<00:01:45.090> in<00:01:45.180> shape<00:01:45.210> and<00:01:46.040> i<00:01:47.040> think<00:01:47.130> i<00:01:47.640> was

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
out and get in shape and i think i was

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.260 
out and get in shape and i think i was
about<00:01:47.909> 185<00:01:48.509> is<00:01:48.869> like<00:01:49.229> in<00:01:49.409> that<00:01:49.530> area<00:01:49.799> and<00:01:50.579> now<00:01:51.240> I

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
about 185 is like in that area and now I

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.929 
about 185 is like in that area and now I
160<00:01:51.899> so<00:01:51.960> that's<00:01:52.170> 25<00:01:52.619> pounds<00:01:52.950> of<00:01:53.009> different<00:01:53.640> so

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
160 so that's 25 pounds of different so

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.460 
160 so that's 25 pounds of different so
I<00:01:53.970> figured<00:01:54.210> I<00:01:54.780> would<00:01:54.990> do<00:01:55.110> a<00:01:55.140> before-and-after

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470
