00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.279
 the race track homestead speedway in the us 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.839
 Federal State of Florida 

00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:13.860
 Here Lamborghini presents his 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:15.450
 latest weapon 1 700 ps we monster with 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.820
 wants to give gas to this fight 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:21.260
 must have a six in the lottery or 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.260
 be a grip test driver 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:27.500
 but which megastadt matthias malmedie 

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:30.060
 here on the horns 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:33.079
 about friends of well-groomed motorsport 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:38.460
 on the way in the new lamborghini aventador 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:40.620
 lp 700 4 roadster alone the name 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.160
 need to pronounce this vehicle 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:46.130
 We're around five seconds or so 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:48.170
 What a mad part is because 

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:53.930
 this wedge accelerates in just five 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:56.600
 seconds from 0 to 100 40 km h the 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:59.390
 lamborghini aventador roadster 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:03.110
 radical fight torpedo with corners and 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:06.170
 700 ps and four-wheel drive 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:10.240
 permanent for ford more snappy and brutal 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.240
 can not be an open two-seater 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:15.480
 in the back lurks 1,600 liters of v12 engine 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.880
 on his mission 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:18.970
 is this fighting animal ever see 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.680
 was 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:24.100
 or lamborghini is so over the target 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:26.680
 matthias shot out today 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:29.970
 Find out on public roads 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.970
 and on the race track 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:37.990
 unfortunately, the weather is atypical mariani 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:40.470
 it's exciting matthias must be closed 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:40.470
 Driving hood 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:48.140
 come in sport mode 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:50.560
 they require 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.560
 the men 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.720
 untypical for a modern sports car 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.040
 there is no in the aventador 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.960
 Double clutch 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.119
 instead one works in the roadster 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.209
 automated circuit with brute force 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.209
 violence 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.960
 in clear 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:23.220
 and again have this brutality 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:23.220
 the boy is already extreme 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.690
 in a seemingly 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:34.260
 by indicating lasts 50 milliseconds 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:38.180
 By the way, until the next winter 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.180
 fast and very 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:49.060
 clear but the manual top leaves 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:50.250
 but only in the stand open why 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.510
 actually 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:54.069
 There are exactly three reasons why 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:57.190
 lamborghini decided to do it 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:59.440
 at the aventador by hand as well 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:01.330
 montiel has chosen the roof that it 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:02.769
 first the stiffness because this is here 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:05.680
 of course with the carbon an extremely 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:07.840
 firm connection is from there to that 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.190
 second is that because of it 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.540
 that this posed and so on 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:12.250
 goes away and that's what I thought back here 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.900
 has to be worked out here 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:16.750
 the rear view is clear on this 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:18.840
 beautiful v12 genset and the third 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:20.650
 Of course, the weight is included 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.630
 Electric motors fall away the whole 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:24.220
 rod falls away we only have this 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:26.080
 two little things the six kilo 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:29.019
 weigh on the degradation on the look 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:30.790
 Let's do it with a little practice 

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:33.190
 just fumble a bit 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:35.230
 unlock twice and that's it 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:37.750
 first part of the day in the trunk 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:40.330
 stowed on it goes with the second 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:45.480
 half 

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:48.400
 after home the ultras in front of every café 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:53.020
 again with his lamborghini he does 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:54.300
 again on it or in half 

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:56.620
 also in it 

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:58.090
 on the race track leaves the roadster 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:00.910
 absolutely nothing to burn 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:03.100
 with 700 ps and 690 newton meters 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:04.710
 Torque is 350 km h 

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:07.770
 maximum speed possible 

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:10.480
 From 0 to 100, only three seconds pass 

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:15.510
 Basic prize for the primeval power on wheels 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:15.510
 proudly 357,000 euros 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:19.380
 but 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:21.450
 you can with the lamborghini too 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:23.970
 have fun off the track 

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:27.290
 matthias makes the everyday check and 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:27.290
 drives on public roads 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:39.790
 friends now it's on the highway 

00:04:45.439 --> 00:04:51.079
 this is unbeliveable 

00:04:47.519 --> 00:04:51.079
 now comes the soundcheck 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:57.069
 and now I know why lamborghini 

00:04:54.099 --> 00:04:59.500
 this coupé has cut open and one 

00:04:57.069 --> 00:05:03.219
 roadster has built because it still is 

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:05.500
 Pure is even closer to all this 

00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:08.020
 Car you can hear the engine you feel 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:09.819
 We could get in the wind 350 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:12.129
 theoretically on the drive but only 

00:05:09.819 --> 00:05:13.090
 theoretically because matthias is back in 

00:05:12.129 --> 00:05:15.300
 the city on the way 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:18.099
 There he meets astonished passers-by 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:18.610
 and a speed limit of 30 miles per 

00:05:18.099 --> 00:05:21.939
 hour 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:26.129
 that's the equivalent of 50 km h with one 

00:05:21.939 --> 00:05:26.129
 laboratory you have to be extremely careful here 

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:34.540
 a lamborghini 

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:34.540
 53 the police has 

00:05:35.509 --> 00:05:40.169
 who controls his gas foot but under control 

00:05:38.039 --> 00:05:41.940
 and can look at envious looks 

00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:44.250
 cozy with the aventador 

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:46.949
 City cruises and stop thanks to start 

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:48.180
 Automatically also gasoline save that 

00:05:46.949 --> 00:05:49.470
 interested in a supercar 

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:52.639
 but nobody 

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:52.639
 certainly not matthias 

00:05:55.380 --> 00:06:00.040
 she referred to that is perverted it is 

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:02.080
 decadent 

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:03.430
 But the customers who buy such a car 

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:05.200
 want just want 

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:07.120
 attract attention with the car at any price 

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:07.600
 We want this fresh air experience 

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:09.370
 to have 

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:11.460
 and they just want the hottest 

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:15.240
 types of the world side and the thickest 

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:17.789
 therefore I can accept 

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:21.210
 if i had 360,000 euros i would really 

00:06:17.789 --> 00:06:23.099
 But that's not why I live 

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:25.770
 the walk will remain in the aventador 

00:06:23.099 --> 00:06:29.150
 roadster through miami a short trip 

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:29.150
 into the world of the super-rich
