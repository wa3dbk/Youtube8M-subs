00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
it's so predictable you know it doesn't

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:01.140 
it's so predictable you know it doesn't
do<00:02:00.570> anything

that plays into testing a ton of
different<00:02:07.690> tracks<00:02:08.020> man<00:02:08.290> we<00:02:08.380> took<00:02:08.500> it<00:02:08.649> to<00:02:08.680> Glen

great<00:02:18.400> everywhere<00:02:18.820> I<00:02:18.880> mean<00:02:19.120> that<00:02:19.300> the<00:02:19.720> first

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:19.960 
great everywhere I mean that the first

great everywhere I mean that the first
day<00:02:20.140> the<00:02:20.290> shootout<00:02:20.620> we<00:02:20.920> always<00:02:21.220> have<00:02:21.430> an<00:02:21.550> idea

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
day the shootout we always have an idea

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:23.940 
day the shootout we always have an idea
of<00:02:21.880> where<00:02:22.120> something's<00:02:22.600> gonna<00:02:22.780> stack<00:02:23.050> up<00:02:23.290> but

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
of where something's gonna stack up but

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:25.170 
of where something's gonna stack up but
with<00:02:24.100> that<00:02:24.220> thing<00:02:24.460> at<00:02:24.580> the<00:02:24.670> end<00:02:24.700> of<00:02:24.880> the<00:02:24.940> first

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
with that thing at the end of the first

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:26.640 
with that thing at the end of the first
day<00:02:25.330> you<00:02:25.540> know<00:02:25.570> you<00:02:25.750> could<00:02:25.900> really<00:02:26.080> tell<00:02:26.320> okay

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
day you know you could really tell okay

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:28.140 
day you know you could really tell okay
so<00:02:26.710> it's<00:02:27.040> a<00:02:27.100> good<00:02:27.130> performing<00:02:27.640> bike<00:02:27.820> for<00:02:28.030> this

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
so it's a good performing bike for this

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.300 
so it's a good performing bike for this
track<00:02:28.390> take<00:02:28.690> it<00:02:28.810> to<00:02:28.900> a<00:02:28.930> few<00:02:29.140> more<00:02:29.320> tracks<00:02:29.620> and

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
track take it to a few more tracks and

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:31.560 
track take it to a few more tracks and
holy<00:02:30.520> smokes<00:02:30.820> the<00:02:30.970> thing<00:02:31.120> works<00:02:31.300> pretty<00:02:31.390> good

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:31.570 
holy smokes the thing works pretty good

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:34.020 
holy smokes the thing works pretty good
where<00:02:32.020> do<00:02:32.440> you<00:02:32.530> think<00:02:32.740> Kieffer<00:02:33.130> does<00:02:33.340> it<00:02:33.490> does

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
where do you think Kieffer does it does

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:35.310 
where do you think Kieffer does it does
it<00:02:34.150> come<00:02:34.270> up<00:02:34.390> short<00:02:34.570> where<00:02:34.810> does<00:02:34.900> it<00:02:35.020> not<00:02:35.110> work

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:35.320 
it come up short where does it not work

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:37.080 
it come up short where does it not work
well<00:02:35.560> you<00:02:35.800> know<00:02:36.220> what's<00:02:36.430> lacking<00:02:36.610> how<00:02:36.970> would

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
well you know what's lacking how would

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.870 
well you know what's lacking how would
you<00:02:37.180> model<00:02:37.510> I<00:02:37.690> mean<00:02:37.990> if<00:02:38.950> I<00:02:39.190> could<00:02:39.459> I<00:02:39.490> would<00:02:39.730> like

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:39.880 
you model I mean if I could I would like

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.210 
you model I mean if I could I would like
a<00:02:39.910> little<00:02:40.150> bit<00:02:40.270> motor<00:02:40.600> of<00:02:40.930> a<00:02:41.709> strawberry<00:02:41.890> motor

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
a little bit motor of a strawberry motor

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.760 
a little bit motor of a strawberry motor
off<00:02:43.000> the<00:02:43.480> bottom<00:02:43.840> you<00:02:43.990> know<00:02:44.020> throttle

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:44.770 
off the bottom you know throttle

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:46.170 
off the bottom you know throttle
response<00:02:44.860> is<00:02:45.280> good<00:02:45.520> but<00:02:45.730> I<00:02:45.760> could<00:02:46.000> use<00:02:46.120> a

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
response is good but I could use a

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.270 
response is good but I could use a
little<00:02:46.300> bit<00:02:46.450> more<00:02:46.510> snap<00:02:46.930> and<00:02:47.230> more<00:02:47.830> bottom<00:02:48.160> out

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
little bit more snap and more bottom out

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.440 
little bit more snap and more bottom out
of<00:02:48.400> a<00:02:48.459> corner<00:02:49.530> also<00:02:50.530> to<00:02:50.590> maybe<00:02:50.980> I<00:02:51.520> could<00:02:52.300> use

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
of a corner also to maybe I could use

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.930 
of a corner also to maybe I could use
maybe<00:02:52.750> up<00:02:52.990> to<00:02:53.020> two<00:02:53.440> teeth<00:02:53.800> larger<00:02:54.580> in<00:02:54.700> the<00:02:54.790> rear

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
maybe up to two teeth larger in the rear

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:58.710 
maybe up to two teeth larger in the rear
to<00:02:54.970> maybe<00:02:55.330> get<00:02:55.570> some<00:02:55.780> of<00:02:55.810> that<00:02:56.370> but<00:02:57.370> I<00:02:57.720> don't

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
to maybe get some of that but I don't

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.570 
to maybe get some of that but I don't
want<00:02:58.870> to<00:02:58.990> kill<00:02:59.320> the<00:02:59.470> mid<00:02:59.650> and<00:02:59.770> top<00:02:59.980> you<00:03:00.190> know<00:03:00.310> so

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:00.580 
want to kill the mid and top you know so

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.910 
want to kill the mid and top you know so
if<00:03:01.270> I<00:03:01.450> had<00:03:01.630> to<00:03:01.660> choose<00:03:01.930> I<00:03:02.230> would<00:03:02.290> like<00:03:02.560> to<00:03:02.709> see<00:03:02.890> a

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
if I had to choose I would like to see a

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.199 
if I had to choose I would like to see a
little<00:03:03.070> bit<00:03:03.220> stronger<00:03:03.610> of<00:03:03.640> a<00:03:03.730> motor<00:03:03.910> I<00:03:04.000> would

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:04.209 
little bit stronger of a motor I would

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:05.940 
little bit stronger of a motor I would
keep<00:03:04.360> I<00:03:04.570> think<00:03:04.780> Honda<00:03:05.320> nailed<00:03:05.560> it<00:03:05.739> with<00:03:05.830> the

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
keep I think Honda nailed it with the

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:07.530 
keep I think Honda nailed it with the
frame<00:03:06.190> in<00:03:06.400> the<00:03:06.459> chassis<00:03:06.700> I<00:03:06.880> think<00:03:07.150> they're

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
frame in the chassis I think they're

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:08.040 
frame in the chassis I think they're
spot-on

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:08.050 
spot-on

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:09.780 
spot-on
I<00:03:08.260> just<00:03:08.590> think<00:03:08.769> they<00:03:08.860> could<00:03:09.010> use<00:03:09.040> a<00:03:09.190> little<00:03:09.670> bit

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 
I just think they could use a little bit

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:11.890 
I just think they could use a little bit
more<00:03:09.850> in<00:03:10.150> the<00:03:10.269> motor

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
more in the motor

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:13.900 
more in the motor
so<00:03:12.620> booth<00:03:12.770> you<00:03:12.920> for<00:03:13.100> a<00:03:13.130> stock<00:03:13.370> race<00:03:13.640> bike

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:13.910 
so booth you for a stock race bike

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:15.670 
so booth you for a stock race bike
you've<00:03:14.630> written<00:03:14.840> a<00:03:14.960> ton<00:03:15.110> of<00:03:15.170> Honda's<00:03:15.560> and

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680 
you've written a ton of Honda's and

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.160 
you've written a ton of Honda's and
you've<00:03:15.800> tried<00:03:16.010> mod<00:03:16.550> pipes<00:03:16.850> on<00:03:17.060> them<00:03:17.180> too<00:03:17.390> you

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.170 
you've tried mod pipes on them too you

know<00:04:42.230> that<00:04:42.410> that<00:04:42.710> thing<00:04:42.860> is<00:04:42.890> in<00:04:43.100> good<00:04:43.250> shape

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:43.310 
know that that thing is in good shape

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:45.310 
know that that thing is in good shape
considering<00:04:43.970> how<00:04:44.240> much<00:04:44.390> we<00:04:44.450> flogged<00:04:44.840> it<00:04:45.020> over

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:45.320 
considering how much we flogged it over

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:46.930 
considering how much we flogged it over
the<00:04:45.410> shootout<00:04:45.740> and<00:04:46.070> still<00:04:46.340> looking<00:04:46.580> good<00:04:46.760> you

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:46.940 
the shootout and still looking good you

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:48.550 
the shootout and still looking good you
change<00:04:47.150> the<00:04:47.270> oil<00:04:47.330> you're<00:04:47.960> not<00:04:48.080> finding<00:04:48.380> big

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:48.560 
change the oil you're not finding big

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.650 
change the oil you're not finding big
chunks<00:04:48.919> of<00:04:48.980> metal<00:04:49.250> I<00:04:49.340> mean<00:04:49.370> you<00:04:50.120> trust<00:04:50.300> Honda's

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:50.660 
chunks of metal I mean you trust Honda's

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:53.020 
chunks of metal I mean you trust Honda's
right<00:04:50.810> this<00:04:50.960> totally<00:04:51.800> the<00:04:52.280> Honda<00:04:52.580> motor<00:04:52.760> has<00:04:53.000> a

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:53.030 
right this totally the Honda motor has a

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:55.150 
right this totally the Honda motor has a
separate<00:04:53.540> transmission<00:04:54.290> oil<00:04:54.620> a<00:04:54.860> separate

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:55.160 
separate transmission oil a separate

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:57.280 
separate transmission oil a separate
motor<00:04:55.280> oil<00:04:55.550> and<00:04:55.820> so<00:04:56.419> that<00:04:56.600> really<00:04:56.930> plays<00:04:57.260> into

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:57.290 
motor oil and so that really plays into

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:59.170 
motor oil and so that really plays into
the<00:04:57.620> mount<00:04:57.770> a<00:04:57.830> lot<00:04:57.950> of<00:04:58.070> your<00:04:58.190> clutch<00:04:58.430> wear<00:04:58.880> and

00:04:59.170 --> 00:04:59.180 
the mount a lot of your clutch wear and

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:00.520 
the mount a lot of your clutch wear and
your<00:04:59.300> fibers<00:04:59.690> and<00:04:59.810> your<00:04:59.900> transmission<00:05:00.380> isn't

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:00.530 
your fibers and your transmission isn't

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:02.080 
your fibers and your transmission isn't
circulating<00:05:01.160> through<00:05:01.370> here<00:05:01.550> through<00:05:02.060> your

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:02.090 
circulating through here through your

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:04.810 
circulating through here through your
motor<00:05:02.360> keeping<00:05:02.690> that<00:05:02.840> cool<00:05:03.050> so<00:05:03.400> it<00:05:04.400> just<00:05:04.610> adds

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:04.820 
motor keeping that cool so it just adds

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:07.240 
motor keeping that cool so it just adds
to<00:05:05.270> the<00:05:05.419> durability<00:05:05.570> longevity<00:05:06.530> because<00:05:06.680> your

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:07.250 
to the durability longevity because your

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:08.230 
to the durability longevity because your
oil<00:05:07.430> isn't<00:05:07.700> running<00:05:07.970> through<00:05:08.120> the<00:05:08.210> entire

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:08.240 
oil isn't running through the entire

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:10.870 
oil isn't running through the entire
motor<00:05:08.810> and<00:05:09.020> picking<00:05:09.290> up<00:05:09.410> contaminants<00:05:10.190> as<00:05:10.430> if

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:10.880 
motor and picking up contaminants as if

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:13.120 
motor and picking up contaminants as if
a<00:05:10.970> motors<00:05:11.240> is<00:05:11.390> running<00:05:11.690> that<00:05:11.840> so<00:05:12.169> it<00:05:12.650> does<00:05:12.860> and

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:13.130 
a motors is running that so it does and

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:14.760 
a motors is running that so it does and
how<00:05:13.550> does<00:05:13.790> help<00:05:14.030> that<00:05:14.060> about

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:14.770 
how does help that about

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:16.920 
how does help that about
yeah<00:05:14.979> good<00:05:15.370> point<00:05:15.610> so<00:05:15.789> overall<00:05:16.090> minor<00:05:16.630> tweaks

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:16.930 
yeah good point so overall minor tweaks

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:18.540 
yeah good point so overall minor tweaks
for<00:05:17.229> the<00:05:17.319> 2013<00:05:17.919> you<00:05:18.099> know<00:05:18.220> it's<00:05:18.370> different

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:18.550 
for the 2013 you know it's different

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:19.980 
for the 2013 you know it's different
components<00:05:19.180> in<00:05:19.240> the<00:05:19.330> suspension<00:05:19.810> a<00:05:19.840> little

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:19.990 
components in the suspension a little

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:21.930 
components in the suspension a little
bit<00:05:20.080> different<00:05:20.380> valving<00:05:20.740> also<00:05:21.490> they<00:05:21.639> did<00:05:21.789> some

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:21.940 
bit different valving also they did some

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:24.900 
bit different valving also they did some
mapping<00:05:22.120> changes<00:05:22.690> and<00:05:22.900> the<00:05:23.889> dunlop<00:05:24.250> MX<00:05:24.610> 50

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:24.910 
mapping changes and the dunlop MX 50

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:26.550 
mapping changes and the dunlop MX 50
ones<00:05:25.090> it's<00:05:25.330> a<00:05:25.419> new<00:05:25.539> separate<00:05:25.900> tire<00:05:26.080> this<00:05:26.319> year

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:26.560 
ones it's a new separate tire this year

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:28.890 
ones it's a new separate tire this year
coming<00:05:27.310> straight<00:05:27.610> stock<00:05:28.210> which<00:05:28.419> is<00:05:28.539> cool<00:05:28.720> from

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:28.900 
coming straight stock which is cool from

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:31.620 
coming straight stock which is cool from
dunlop<00:05:29.229> so<00:05:29.530> you<00:05:30.400> know<00:05:30.520> final<00:05:30.940> ranking<00:05:31.300> for<00:05:31.509> me

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:31.630 
dunlop so you know final ranking for me

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:33.390 
dunlop so you know final ranking for me
it<00:05:31.750> was<00:05:31.840> my<00:05:31.990> favorite<00:05:32.289> bike<00:05:32.470> just<00:05:32.770> based<00:05:33.250> on

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:33.400 
it was my favorite bike just based on

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:35.249 
it was my favorite bike just based on
how<00:05:33.580> many<00:05:33.729> tracks<00:05:34.000> we<00:05:34.210> wrote<00:05:34.389> it<00:05:34.509> at<00:05:34.660> how<00:05:35.020> well

00:05:35.249 --> 00:05:35.259 
how many tracks we wrote it at how well

00:05:35.259 --> 00:05:36.480 
how many tracks we wrote it at how well
it<00:05:35.380> worked<00:05:35.530> where's<00:05:35.830> the<00:05:35.919> stack<00:05:36.099> up<00:05:36.250> for<00:05:36.430> you

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:36.490 
it worked where's the stack up for you

else was spot-on for me out of the blast
riding<00:05:52.270> that<00:05:52.360> thing<00:05:52.419> that<00:05:52.750> was<00:05:52.840> great<00:05:53.110> yeah

and you take one off-road on it oh yeah
definitely<00:05:56.229> our<00:05:57.039> last<00:05:57.370> year's<00:05:57.639> bike<00:05:57.819> that<00:05:58.060> we

00:05:58.430 --> 00:05:58.440 
definitely our last year's bike that we

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:00.749 
definitely our last year's bike that we
long<00:05:59.440> haul<00:05:59.680> that<00:05:59.889> thing<00:06:00.159> and<00:06:00.310> turn<00:06:00.490> into<00:06:00.639> a

00:06:00.749 --> 00:06:00.759 
long haul that thing and turn into a

00:06:00.759 --> 00:06:02.850 
long haul that thing and turn into a
duro<00:06:01.000> cross<00:06:01.300> bike<00:06:01.599> we<00:06:01.990> raced<00:06:02.229> it<00:06:02.440> in<00:06:02.560> some

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:02.860 
duro cross bike we raced it in some

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:05.249 
duro cross bike we raced it in some
off-road<00:06:03.310> top<00:06:03.789> events<00:06:04.300> put<00:06:04.509> an<00:06:04.599> 18-inch<00:06:05.050> wheel

00:06:05.249 --> 00:06:05.259 
off-road top events put an 18-inch wheel

00:06:05.259 --> 00:06:07.409 
off-road top events put an 18-inch wheel
on<00:06:05.530> it<00:06:05.560> the<00:06:06.340> fuel<00:06:06.849> injection<00:06:07.120> is<00:06:07.270> so

00:06:07.409 --> 00:06:07.419 
on it the fuel injection is so

00:06:07.419 --> 00:06:08.999 
on it the fuel injection is so
consistent<00:06:07.750> on<00:06:07.990> that<00:06:08.020> and<00:06:08.349> smooth<00:06:08.650> off<00:06:08.830> the

00:06:08.999 --> 00:06:09.009 
consistent on that and smooth off the

00:06:09.009 --> 00:06:11.399 
consistent on that and smooth off the
bottom<00:06:09.370> that<00:06:09.520> you<00:06:09.940> know<00:06:10.030> it<00:06:10.360> can<00:06:10.539> smash<00:06:11.139> into<00:06:11.380> a

00:06:11.399 --> 00:06:11.409 
bottom that you know it can smash into a

00:06:11.409 --> 00:06:14.129 
bottom that you know it can smash into a
