00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:08.620
 because dust 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.290
 I like 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:51.199
 hello guys i heard the work 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:53.050
 just wants to litter with brad 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:55.220
 Of course I like to give some tips 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:56.379
 The throw is basically natural 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:59.449
 not otherwise 

00:00:56.379 --> 00:01:04.699
 but you have to aim differently than if 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:05.239
 you from the front acts the throwing hand remains 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:09.190
 the same 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:11.420
 switzerland's fingers 90 degrees angle 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:14.180
 the other hand supports the ball 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.780
 actually only and then always on it 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:16.910
 respect, think highly of 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.190
 he asks you to fold down with the 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:21.619
 Wrist and finger that direction 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:25.970
 basket shows and you have to industrial 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:28.810
 quadrangle rhine and best we show 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:28.810
 blur yourself 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.460
 best still in the knee all the way 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:49.840
 the legs are used that you 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:53.170
 Do not throw so much out of the arm then it is 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:56.580
 make it even easier and enjoyable 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:56.580
 Practice and a lot of hits
