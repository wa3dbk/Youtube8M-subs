perform that first connection to a
wireless<00:00:52.140> router<00:00:52.410> it's<00:00:53.039> a<00:00:53.129> bit<00:00:53.280> cumbersome

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
wireless router it's a bit cumbersome

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.509 
wireless router it's a bit cumbersome
that's<00:00:54.449> why<00:00:54.600> WPS<00:00:55.170> was<00:00:55.350> invented<00:00:55.829> I<00:00:56.010> will

00:00:56.509 --> 00:00:56.519 
that's why WPS was invented I will

00:00:56.519 --> 00:00:58.069 
that's why WPS was invented I will
connect<00:00:56.789> this<00:00:56.969> computer<00:00:57.449> to<00:00:57.719> this<00:00:57.870> router

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
connect this computer to this router

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.410 
connect this computer to this router
using<00:00:58.530> both<00:00:58.710> methods<00:00:58.739> and<00:00:59.489> a<00:00:59.579> timer<00:00:59.909> so<00:01:00.210> that

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
using both methods and a timer so that

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.419 
using both methods and a timer so that
you<00:01:00.539> can<00:01:00.659> see<00:01:00.839> the<00:01:00.989> real<00:01:01.019> time<00:01:01.350> savings<00:01:01.800> of<00:01:01.890> WPS

00:01:02.419 --> 00:01:02.429 
you can see the real time savings of WPS

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:04.369 
you can see the real time savings of WPS
so<00:01:03.329> let's<00:01:03.510> start<00:01:03.749> by<00:01:03.899> connecting<00:01:04.110> the

so let's start by connecting the
traditional<00:01:04.800> way<00:01:08.870> I've<00:01:09.870> just<00:01:10.080> started<00:01:10.409> the

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:10.620 
traditional way I've just started the

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:13.190

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
for the network to connect and i will

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:38.210 
for the network to connect and i will
stop<00:02:32.910> the<00:02:33.090> timer<00:02:35.959> that<00:02:36.959> took<00:02:37.200> 1<00:02:37.379> minute<00:02:37.410> and<00:02:37.769> 31

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
stop the timer that took 1 minute and 31

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:44.780 
stop the timer that took 1 minute and 31
seconds<00:02:42.920> now<00:02:43.920> I<00:02:43.950> did<00:02:44.160> talk<00:02:44.310> my<00:02:44.489> way<00:02:44.519> through

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
seconds now I did talk my way through

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.190 
seconds now I did talk my way through
the<00:02:44.879> demonstration<00:02:45.450> so<00:02:45.569> the<00:02:45.690> time<00:02:45.870> could<00:02:46.110> have

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
the demonstration so the time could have

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.990 
the demonstration so the time could have
been<00:02:46.290> a<00:02:46.319> bit<00:02:46.500> shorter<00:02:46.860> however<00:02:47.549> it<00:02:47.760> could<00:02:47.879> have

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
been a bit shorter however it could have

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.849 
been a bit shorter however it could have
easily<00:02:48.150> been<00:02:48.480> longer<00:02:48.780> what<00:02:49.349> if<00:02:49.440> I<00:02:49.530> had<00:02:49.620> a<00:02:49.680> hard

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:49.859 
easily been longer what if I had a hard

00:02:49.859 --> 00:02:51.500 
easily been longer what if I had a hard
time<00:02:49.920> finding<00:02:50.430> the<00:02:50.489> encryption<00:02:50.879> key<00:02:50.910> or<00:02:51.299> what

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
time finding the encryption key or what

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:52.819 
time finding the encryption key or what
if<00:02:51.599> i<00:02:51.660> had<00:02:51.780> lost<00:02:51.930> encryption<00:02:52.530> key<00:02:52.680> all

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:52.829 
if i had lost encryption key all

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:55.130 
if i had lost encryption key all
together<00:02:53.010> if<00:02:53.790> i<00:02:53.970> had<00:02:54.090> lost<00:02:54.269> encryption<00:02:54.780> key<00:02:54.959> i

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
together if i had lost encryption key i

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:56.119 
together if i had lost encryption key i
would<00:02:55.319> have<00:02:55.410> had<00:02:55.530> to<00:02:55.620> log<00:02:55.799> into<00:02:55.950> the<00:02:56.099> router

00:02:56.119 --> 00:02:56.129 
would have had to log into the router

00:02:56.129 --> 00:02:58.339 
would have had to log into the router
which<00:02:57.030> i<00:02:57.180> could<00:02:57.239> have<00:02:57.480> also<00:02:57.690> forgotten<00:02:58.049> how<00:02:58.290> to

00:02:58.339 --> 00:02:58.349 
which i could have also forgotten how to

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:00.289 
which i could have also forgotten how to
do<00:02:58.590> which<00:02:59.220> could<00:02:59.400> have<00:02:59.489> added<00:02:59.609> more<00:02:59.849> time<00:03:00.120> to

00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:00.299 
do which could have added more time to

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:02.240 
do which could have added more time to
connecting<00:03:00.660> to<00:03:00.720> the<00:03:00.840> router<00:03:01.099> alright<00:03:02.099> so

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
connecting to the router alright so

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:03.920 
connecting to the router alright so
let's<00:03:02.459> disconnect<00:03:02.880> our<00:03:03.090> existing<00:03:03.540> connection

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
let's disconnect our existing connection

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:05.449 
let's disconnect our existing connection
with<00:03:04.049> the<00:03:04.139> router<00:03:04.319> close<00:03:05.040> the<00:03:05.160> wireless

okay<00:03:16.340> keep<00:03:17.340> in<00:03:17.489> mind<00:03:17.730> with<00:03:18.299> WPS<00:03:18.840> there's<00:03:19.440> two

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
okay keep in mind with WPS there's two

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.440 
okay keep in mind with WPS there's two
different<00:03:19.799> flavors<00:03:20.280> there's<00:03:20.849> push<00:03:21.120> button

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
different flavors there's push button

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.509 
different flavors there's push button

method and utility method with the
utility<00:03:23.940> method<00:03:24.299> you've<00:03:24.599> guessed<00:03:24.810> it<00:03:24.989> you

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:25.169 
utility method you've guessed it you

00:03:25.169 --> 00:03:27.339 
utility method you've guessed it you
have<00:03:25.260> to<00:03:25.349> open<00:03:25.620> the<00:03:25.709> utility<00:03:26.160> to<00:03:26.370> initiate<00:03:26.819> WPS

00:03:27.339 --> 00:03:27.349 
have to open the utility to initiate WPS

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:29.569 
have to open the utility to initiate WPS
doing<00:03:28.349> this<00:03:28.470> almost<00:03:28.709> takes<00:03:29.040> as<00:03:29.160> long<00:03:29.340> as<00:03:29.519> a

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:29.579 
doing this almost takes as long as a

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:31.849 
doing this almost takes as long as a
traditional<00:03:29.760> method<00:03:30.389> with<00:03:31.139> the<00:03:31.319> push<00:03:31.530> button

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:31.859 
traditional method with the push button

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:33.800 
traditional method with the push button
method<00:03:31.980> you<00:03:32.400> save<00:03:32.579> a<00:03:32.609> lot<00:03:32.760> of<00:03:32.819> time<00:03:33.090> all<00:03:33.569> you

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
method you save a lot of time all you

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:35.720 
method you save a lot of time all you
need<00:03:33.930> is<00:03:33.959> a<00:03:34.049> WPS<00:03:34.590> button<00:03:34.620> on<00:03:35.069> your<00:03:35.220> router<00:03:35.459> and

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
need is a WPS button on your router and

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:38.839 
need is a WPS button on your router and
adapter<00:03:36.739> most<00:03:37.739> of<00:03:37.889> try<00:03:38.130> nets<00:03:38.310> routers<00:03:38.669> and
