Pluto breakers those special techniques
designed<00:00:09.500> to<00:00:09.980> let<00:00:10.160> you<00:00:10.400> get<00:00:10.700> over<00:00:11.000> a<00:00:11.539> worker

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:11.900 
designed to let you get over a worker

progress<00:00:14.120> on<00:00:14.540> a<00:00:15.259> specific<00:00:15.610> muscle<00:00:16.610> and<00:00:16.849> the

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:17.180 
progress on a specific muscle and the

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:19.269 
progress on a specific muscle and the
Pluto<00:00:17.509> breaker<00:00:17.900> we're<00:00:18.110> examining<00:00:18.500> today<00:00:18.830> is

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:19.279 
Pluto breaker we're examining today is

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:22.750 
Pluto breaker we're examining today is
called<00:00:20.180> the<00:00:20.680> superset<00:00:21.680> now<00:00:22.010> there<00:00:22.430> are<00:00:22.580> many

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:22.760 
called the superset now there are many

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:24.910 
called the superset now there are many
different<00:00:23.180> kinds<00:00:23.330> of<00:00:23.599> super<00:00:23.960> sets<00:00:24.199> but<00:00:24.470> we<00:00:24.800> are

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:24.920 
different kinds of super sets but we are

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:27.279 
different kinds of super sets but we are
specifically<00:00:25.519> looking<00:00:25.760> today<00:00:26.359> at<00:00:26.390> what<00:00:27.170> is

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:27.289 
specifically looking today at what is

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:30.880 
specifically looking today at what is
called<00:00:27.640> agonist<00:00:28.869> antagonist<00:00:29.869> super<00:00:30.470> sets<00:00:30.710> and

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:30.890 
called agonist antagonist super sets and

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:34.329 
called agonist antagonist super sets and
what<00:00:31.160> these<00:00:31.550> do<00:00:31.849> is<00:00:31.880> they<00:00:32.839> first<00:00:33.470> have<00:00:33.949> you<00:00:34.129> do

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:34.339 
what these do is they first have you do

00:00:34.339 --> 00:00:36.850 
what these do is they first have you do
an<00:00:34.670> exercise<00:00:35.239> for<00:00:36.019> the<00:00:36.080> muscle<00:00:36.589> that<00:00:36.739> you

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:36.860 
an exercise for the muscle that you

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.490 
an exercise for the muscle that you
cease<00:00:37.129> making<00:00:37.400> progress<00:00:37.850> on<00:00:38.239> the<00:00:38.839> agonist<00:00:39.320> and

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:39.500 
cease making progress on the agonist and

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.759 
cease making progress on the agonist and
then<00:00:40.129> you<00:00:40.489> directly<00:00:41.089> switch<00:00:41.540> over<00:00:42.019> to<00:00:42.199> the

00:00:42.759 --> 00:00:42.769 
then you directly switch over to the

00:00:42.769 --> 00:00:45.850 
then you directly switch over to the
muscle<00:00:43.269> directly<00:00:44.290> opposing<00:00:45.290> it<00:00:45.409> the

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:45.860 
muscle directly opposing it the

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:49.450 
muscle directly opposing it the
antagonist<00:00:46.820> so<00:00:47.479> for<00:00:47.750> example<00:00:47.869> if<00:00:48.470> I<00:00:49.040> ceased

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:49.460 
antagonist so for example if I ceased

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.329 
antagonist so for example if I ceased
making<00:00:49.850> progress<00:00:50.119> on<00:00:50.600> my<00:00:50.659> biceps<00:00:51.650> I<00:00:51.769> would

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:52.339 
making progress on my biceps I would

00:00:52.339 --> 00:00:55.180 
making progress on my biceps I would
first<00:00:52.790> do<00:00:53.150> biceps<00:00:53.809> exercise<00:00:54.320> like<00:00:54.739> for

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:55.190 
first do biceps exercise like for

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:57.820 
first do biceps exercise like for
example<00:00:55.309> biceps<00:00:56.150> curls<00:00:56.570> and<00:00:56.750> then<00:00:57.290> directly

00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:57.830 
example biceps curls and then directly

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:00.789 
example biceps curls and then directly
without<00:00:58.369> a<00:00:58.430> break<00:00:58.790> I<00:00:58.970> will<00:00:59.449> do<00:00:59.659> a<00:00:59.839> triceps

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:00.799 
without a break I will do a triceps

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:04.000 
without a break I will do a triceps
exercise<00:01:01.460> like<00:01:01.970> kickbacks<00:01:02.629> because<00:01:03.409> the

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:04.010 
exercise like kickbacks because the

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:07.899 
exercise like kickbacks because the
biceps<00:01:04.610> and<00:01:04.820> the<00:01:05.479> triceps<00:01:06.110> are<00:01:06.290> a<00:01:07.100> pair<00:01:07.610> and

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:07.909 
biceps and the triceps are a pair and

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:10.749 
biceps and the triceps are a pair and
when<00:01:08.330> you<00:01:08.450> work<00:01:08.659> the<00:01:08.869> biceps<00:01:09.049> the<00:01:09.619> triceps<00:01:09.979> is

00:01:10.749 --> 00:01:10.759 
when you work the biceps the triceps is

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:17.560 
when you work the biceps the triceps is
the<00:01:11.270> one<00:01:11.450> working<00:01:11.929> against<00:01:12.799> it

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:17.570 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:19.719 

and<00:01:17.810> the<00:01:18.380> reason<00:01:18.560> this<00:01:18.830> works<00:01:19.010> so<00:01:19.250> great<00:01:19.520> this

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:19.729 
and the reason this works so great this

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:21.700 
and the reason this works so great this
is<00:01:20.000> that<00:01:20.479> you<00:01:20.690> are<00:01:20.810> doing<00:01:20.990> something<00:01:21.560> really

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:21.710 
is that you are doing something really

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:24.399 
is that you are doing something really
unusual<00:01:22.070> you<00:01:22.700> for<00:01:22.970> your<00:01:23.120> body<00:01:23.270> by<00:01:23.900> switching

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:24.409 
unusual you for your body by switching

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:28.450 
unusual you for your body by switching
the<00:01:24.680> role<00:01:25.720> your<00:01:26.720> muscle<00:01:27.320> has<00:01:27.530> to<00:01:27.740> fulfill<00:01:28.220> in

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:28.460 
the role your muscle has to fulfill in

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:30.730 
the role your muscle has to fulfill in
the<00:01:28.850> exercises<00:01:29.570> that<00:01:29.720> you<00:01:29.780> do<00:01:30.080> on<00:01:30.320> the<00:01:30.470> first

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:30.740 
the exercises that you do on the first

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.460 
the exercises that you do on the first
exercise<00:01:31.090> this<00:01:32.090> muscle<00:01:32.510> here<00:01:32.720> is<00:01:32.930> the<00:01:33.290> more

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:33.470 
exercise this muscle here is the more

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:35.650 
exercise this muscle here is the more
active<00:01:33.650> one<00:01:34.040> but<00:01:34.310> on<00:01:34.430> the<00:01:34.520> second<00:01:34.880> exercise<00:01:35.210> it

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:35.660 
active one but on the second exercise it

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:37.300 
active one but on the second exercise it
becomes<00:01:36.020> the<00:01:36.320> more<00:01:36.530> passive<00:01:36.950> one<00:01:37.100> and

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310 
becomes the more passive one and

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.510 
becomes the more passive one and
switches<00:01:38.090> roll<00:01:38.360> with<00:01:39.080> the<00:01:39.380> muscle<00:01:39.920> directly

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.520 
switches roll with the muscle directly

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.240 
switches roll with the muscle directly
opposing<00:01:41.479> it<00:01:41.630> in<00:01:41.780> doing<00:01:42.350> something<00:01:42.650> like<00:01:42.830> that

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.250 
opposing it in doing something like that

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:45.249 
opposing it in doing something like that
doing<00:01:43.550> something<00:01:43.850> that<00:01:44.240> breaks<00:01:44.570> up<00:01:44.900> your

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:45.259 
doing something that breaks up your

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:48.640 
doing something that breaks up your
regular<00:01:46.070> pattern<00:01:46.580> of<00:01:46.729> working<00:01:47.330> out<00:01:47.479> often<00:01:47.990> is

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:48.650 
regular pattern of working out often is

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:52.480 
regular pattern of working out often is
the<00:01:48.890> key<00:01:49.160> to<00:01:49.400> get<00:01:50.000> more<00:01:50.690> muscle<00:01:51.470> growth<00:01:51.710> done

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
the key to get more muscle growth done

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:54.700 
the key to get more muscle growth done
now<00:01:53.090> the<00:01:53.149> big<00:01:53.330> question<00:01:53.360> of<00:01:53.810> course<00:01:53.869> is<00:01:54.229> how

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.710 
now the big question of course is how

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:56.889 
now the big question of course is how
should<00:01:55.039> you<00:01:55.070> use<00:01:55.399> these<00:01:55.610> super<00:01:55.970> sets<00:01:56.210> in<00:01:56.390> your

00:01:56.889 --> 00:01:56.899 
should you use these super sets in your

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:58.990 
should you use these super sets in your
workouts<00:01:57.530> and<00:01:57.740> I<00:01:57.830> have<00:01:57.950> three<00:01:58.220> tips<00:01:58.460> for<00:01:58.850> you

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000 
workouts and I have three tips for you

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.580 
workouts and I have three tips for you
the<00:01:59.509> first<00:01:59.869> being<00:02:00.140> that<00:02:01.630> from<00:02:02.630> the<00:02:02.750> exercises

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
the first being that from the exercises

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.850 
the first being that from the exercises
you<00:02:03.860> do<00:02:04.100> for<00:02:04.640> the<00:02:04.759> muscle<00:02:05.180> that<00:02:05.410> has<00:02:06.410> plateaued

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:06.860 
you do for the muscle that has plateaued

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.810 
you do for the muscle that has plateaued
do<00:02:07.789> 1s<00:02:08.860> supersets<00:02:09.860> so<00:02:10.039> for<00:02:10.250> example<00:02:10.280> if

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:10.820 
do 1s supersets so for example if

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:13.900 
do 1s supersets so for example if
episode<00:02:11.480> on<00:02:11.840> my<00:02:12.260> biceps<00:02:12.769> and<00:02:12.950> I<00:02:13.250> do<00:02:13.310> biceps

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
episode on my biceps and I do biceps

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:16.410 
episode on my biceps and I do biceps
curls<00:02:14.209> then<00:02:14.540> I<00:02:14.630> would<00:02:14.690> do<00:02:15.110> biceps<00:02:15.830> curls<00:02:16.190> a

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
curls then I would do biceps curls a

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.410 
curls then I would do biceps curls a
superset<00:02:17.420> where<00:02:17.900> capital<00:02:18.380> them<00:02:18.590> with<00:02:19.420> triceps

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
superset where capital them with triceps

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:23.500 
superset where capital them with triceps
kickbacks<00:02:21.170> and<00:02:21.380> number<00:02:22.130> two<00:02:22.310> because<00:02:22.940> super

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
kickbacks and number two because super

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.990 
kickbacks and number two because super
sets<00:02:23.720> are<00:02:23.900> more<00:02:24.380> exhausting<00:02:25.160> than<00:02:25.310> regular

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
sets are more exhausting than regular

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.350 
sets are more exhausting than regular
sets<00:02:26.540> what<00:02:27.110> I<00:02:27.140> had<00:02:27.380> to<00:02:27.410> do<00:02:27.590> is<00:02:27.799> I<00:02:27.950> keep<00:02:28.580> 90

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
sets what I had to do is I keep 90

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.320 
sets what I had to do is I keep 90
seconds<00:02:29.840> rest<00:02:30.049> between<00:02:30.769> sets<00:02:31.100> to<00:02:31.730> give<00:02:32.000> to

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
seconds rest between sets to give to

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:36.550 
seconds rest between sets to give to
give<00:02:32.810> your<00:02:33.019> body<00:02:33.640> muscles<00:02:34.640> a<00:02:34.850> bit<00:02:35.239> more<00:02:35.959> time

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
give your body muscles a bit more time

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.789 
give your body muscles a bit more time
to<00:02:36.590> recuperate<00:02:37.430> before<00:02:37.790> you<00:02:38.630> do<00:02:38.840> the<00:02:39.290> next<00:02:39.620> set

00:02:39.789 --> 00:02:39.799 
to recuperate before you do the next set

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:43.720 
to recuperate before you do the next set
and<00:02:40.090> number<00:02:41.090> three<00:02:41.480> I<00:02:41.510> would<00:02:42.350> keep<00:02:42.620> this<00:02:43.459> up

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
and number three I would keep this up

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.120 
and number three I would keep this up
for<00:02:44.209> about<00:02:44.390> four<00:02:44.840> weeks<00:02:44.870> and<00:02:45.470> then<00:02:45.769> look

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.130 
for about four weeks and then look

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:48.490 
for about four weeks and then look
whereas<00:02:46.760> and<00:02:47.090> if<00:02:47.239> you<00:02:47.420> are<00:02:47.540> over<00:02:47.959> the<00:02:47.989> Pluto

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
whereas and if you are over the Pluto

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.890 
whereas and if you are over the Pluto
and<00:02:49.010> what<00:02:49.190> I<00:02:49.220> wouldn't<00:02:49.610> do<00:02:49.760> is<00:02:49.940> doing<00:02:50.420> super

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
and what I wouldn't do is doing super

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.170 
and what I wouldn't do is doing super
sets<00:02:51.140> for<00:02:51.350> too<00:02:51.560> long<00:02:51.799> because<00:02:52.280> if<00:02:52.610> you<00:02:52.820> do<00:02:53.000> them

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
sets for too long because if you do them

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.710 
sets for too long because if you do them
for<00:02:53.360> too<00:02:53.540> long<00:02:53.780> then<00:02:54.500> supersets<00:02:55.459> become<00:02:55.970> less

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 
for too long then supersets become less

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:03.180 
for too long then supersets become less
and<00:02:57.079> less<00:02:57.250> useful

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:05.590 

last<00:03:03.850> button<00:03:04.090> means<00:03:04.390> you<00:03:04.570> of<00:03:04.690> course<00:03:04.900> should

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:05.600 
last button means you of course should

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.840 
last button means you of course should
what<00:03:05.930> muscle<00:03:06.290> pairs<00:03:06.500> there<00:03:06.830> are<00:03:07.100> and<00:03:07.370> to<00:03:07.730> keep

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:07.850 
what muscle pairs there are and to keep

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:10.090 
what muscle pairs there are and to keep
this<00:03:08.030> video<00:03:08.210> short<00:03:08.390> I<00:03:08.840> put<00:03:09.110> those<00:03:09.410> pairs<00:03:09.800> or

can<00:03:19.010> use<00:03:19.400> in<00:03:19.640> pairs<00:03:20.120> to<00:03:20.450> train<00:03:20.840> these<00:03:21.320> groups

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 
can use in pairs to train these groups

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:24.430 
can use in pairs to train these groups
