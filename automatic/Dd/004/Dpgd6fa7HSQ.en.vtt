00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:06.999
 or those that make ladies animal lords 

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:10.150
 aliens today with us boil in 

00:00:06.999 --> 00:00:11.770
 the champions good day to start with 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:14.800
 do not leave to leave let's start with the 

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:17.380
 passive seventh already martial the attack 

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:19.990
 initial our initial attack to a 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:22.390
 enemy will inflict extra damage by 6% 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:24.420
 to our current life with up to 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:26.820
 400 points of damage 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.400
 passing every six seconds stability 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.650
 will give us an initial hit stronger than 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.079
 the next and every six seconds goes to 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:37.289
 hit again the same blow 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:39.690
 good our hit the light 

00:00:37.289 --> 00:00:41.100
 his spear inflicting 70 18 points of 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.260
 physical years reducing the maura of 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:47.199
 all enemies for three seconds 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.640
 stability our people speak power 

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:50.879
 throw yourself into the air and it hurts all 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:52.480
 enemies and reduces their armor 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.930
 for three seconds 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:57.820
 the golden tour w gets temporarily 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:00.789
 a shield that grants up to 50 plus 20 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:02.199
 of damage by close champion this scale 

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:04.629
 simply in points does not scale in the 

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:08.049
 peni neither in bird nor in true nor in 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:09.970
 no harm for 5 seconds what 

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:12.670
 makes us give us a shield and reduces the 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:14.220
 movement speed of those who 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:16.350
 touch 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.300
 well our banner is not anymore 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.710
 get 10% speed is here and 10 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:22.200
 of armor while the banner is 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.000
 put will increase our speed to that 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.040
 our armor at the same time 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.730
 we can combine them with our Cuba 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:33.090
 stability does magic damage and lasts 8 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:35.460
 seconds and grants all allies 10 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:38.240
 attack speed this is very good 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.240
 to throw turrets 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:43.210
 to help the team simply 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:45.250
 well the definitive of heart one is 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:47.830
 they call cataclysms alterio education 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:50.470
 champion and encloses it infringing 258 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:52.630
 points years physical creates a terrain 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:54.970
 impassable because you can not enter 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:58.750
 or leave the only way you can 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:02:00.670
 during a big jump picks up what is 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:03.369
 usually done with German is to use 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:07.119
 our jump on the hill of the enemy and 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:09.190
 give the slow and then once 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:11.319
 it ends up in our skill you 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:14.080
 we keep finding our and our q 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:17.910
 in throw to escape because I have no harm 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.910
 in general unless you do this 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:26.580
 very well very dynamic that can 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:29.730
 present a lot of difficulty for the 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:31.709
 times they do not have a good jungle and 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:34.019
 has many viable combinations that 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:36.150
 you can learn as you go 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:37.769
 playing this good change will teach them 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.540
 a little technique that I know how to do as 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:42.780
 hard go for cleaning is very effective 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:45.150
 which is to throw a cube that 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.980
 will reduce the enemy's armor 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.239
 a couple of blows when you run out 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.040
 we cultivate like that will give us 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:53.190
 attack speed and we keep doing 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:55.170
 hurt now I'm level 7 that's why the book 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:57.200
 network does not do anything to me but good is a 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:59.280
 small technique that there is with harvard for 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.319
 can another advice that gives them with 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:03.510
 cracking depends what they want 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:04.799
 improving the skills suits you if 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.720
 they are going to go to the jungle, it suits them 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:08.400
 improve by much the one that will give us more 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.230
 attack speed and more armor what 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:13.109
 that will help us clean faster and 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:15.209
 put more efficient benches if we go 

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:16.650
 to go to a line we will improve the cv already 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:18.390
 that will allow us because ar will give us 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:22.150
 faster and more armor penetration 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:23.230
 and more physical damage 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:26.799
 the double is the last thing that should be 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:28.329
 improve gives us a shield that is improved to 

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:30.099
 unless they are very defensive and the other 

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:33.130
 is giving them sticks to put it like that 

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:34.720
 they put the shield 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:36.100
 good for the jungle time of 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:38.050
 coal we'll start with a machete of 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:41.920
 hunter that we will then transform into a 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:43.210
 spiritual stone after finishing the 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:44.530
 spiritual skin 

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:46.390
 we will complete a mobility boot 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:48.670
 then we finish wheat line with the 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:50.290
 central then a layer of solar post a 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:53.220
 hydrate now to have some damage or 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:54.720
 harmony presage of rande 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:57.300
 if we are going to go to the touch line 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:59.430
 we have two ways 

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:00.690
 and play the initial one would be with a 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:02.070
 crystalline bottle that will help us 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:03.420
 get lucky in a long time or a 

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:05.490
 oran shield and life position 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:07.500
 then we will finish some boots 

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:09.720
 mercury with a solar cloak omen 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:11.970
 true wing bungee candle to have a 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:13.410
 little magic resistance a king 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:14.610
 ruined that will give us the speed that 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:16.200
 it is essential that we will need to 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:18.269
 advancing the lines form the best 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:20.910
 style and we can choose one of these 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:22.800
 three items would be a dark blade if 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:24.630
 we have an enemy tank an idea now 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.250
 if we have an enemy flame a turn 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:29.220
 infinite if we want to hurt him 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:32.449
 devastating to carry we want to spend it 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:34.099
 and destroy it very nice 

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:36.289
 well that was all in the champions 

00:04:34.099 --> 00:04:37.759
 guide and I hope you liked it a lot 

00:04:36.289 --> 00:04:40.610
 serve for harvard is a very change 

00:04:37.759 --> 00:04:43.360
 efficient if you need a jungle and good 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:46.569
 I hope you liked it and now 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:46.569
 and forever
