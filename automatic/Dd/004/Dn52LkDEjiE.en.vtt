00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.260 
do it like this just like you use the
spring<00:01:52.310> diesels<00:01:53.310> of<00:01:53.490> Springs<00:01:53.820> throughout<00:01:54.119> the

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
spring diesels of Springs throughout the

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.270 
spring diesels of Springs throughout the
rest<00:01:54.450> of<00:01:54.540> the<00:01:54.630> level<00:01:54.899> but<00:01:55.530> I<00:01:55.590> think<00:01:55.740> I<00:01:55.979> like<00:01:56.160> it

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
rest of the level but I think I like it

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.450 
rest of the level but I think I like it
that<00:01:56.490> way<00:01:56.550> better<00:01:57.740> it<00:01:58.740> just<00:01:58.920> seems<00:01:59.130> to<00:01:59.340> be

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
that way better it just seems to be

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.210 
that way better it just seems to be
easier<00:02:00.119> to<00:02:00.240> execute<00:02:00.509> oh<00:02:00.930> I<00:02:01.830> almost<00:02:01.979> died<00:02:02.190> on

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:02.220 
easier to execute oh I almost died on

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:07.700 
easier to execute oh I almost died on
Nettles<00:02:04.130> and<00:02:05.130> needless<00:02:06.000> to<00:02:06.180> say<00:02:06.330> they<00:02:07.049> these

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
Nettles and needless to say they these

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.759 
Nettles and needless to say they these
spiked<00:02:08.040> balls<00:02:08.310> explode<00:02:08.820> after<00:02:09.000> a<00:02:09.239> while<00:02:09.769> so

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:10.769 
spiked balls explode after a while so

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:13.250 
spiked balls explode after a while so
watch<00:02:11.280> how<00:02:11.489> fast<00:02:11.730> they<00:02:12.000> flash<00:02:12.330> to<00:02:12.690> get<00:02:12.810> an<00:02:12.900> idea

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
watch how fast they flash to get an idea

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:18.310 
watch how fast they flash to get an idea
on<00:02:13.410> when<00:02:14.310> they'll<00:02:14.549> explode<00:02:14.970> I'll<00:02:15.480> shoot<00:02:16.130> there

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:18.320

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:36.850 
but they're certainly an annoying and

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:39.830 
but they're certainly an annoying and
very<00:03:36.880> well<00:03:37.239> placed<00:03:37.600> in<00:03:37.810> some<00:03:38.050> spots<00:03:38.380> whoops

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
very well placed in some spots whoops

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.600 
very well placed in some spots whoops
yeah<00:03:40.840> these<00:03:40.989> platforms<00:03:41.830> appear<00:03:42.459> and

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:42.610 
yeah these platforms appear and

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:46.890 
yeah these platforms appear and
disappear<00:03:43.590> no<00:03:44.590> problem<00:03:45.010> get<00:03:45.790> a<00:03:45.819> shield<00:03:46.180> here

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:46.900 
disappear no problem get a shield here

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:52.550 
disappear no problem get a shield here
no<00:03:47.140> probably<00:03:47.350> need<00:03:47.590> at<00:03:47.709> this<00:03:47.920> level

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:56.230 

watch<00:03:53.100> out<00:03:53.310> for<00:03:53.520> these<00:03:53.670> I<00:03:54.090> think<00:03:54.780> down<00:03:55.110> is<00:03:55.380> Duff

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:56.240 
watch out for these I think down is Duff

watch out for these I think down is Duff
jump<00:03:57.240> backwards<00:03:57.780> until<00:03:58.080> these<00:03:58.200> platforms

00:03:58.790 --> 00:03:58.800 
jump backwards until these platforms

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:00.140 
jump backwards until these platforms
appear<00:03:58.920> then<00:03:59.250> jump<00:03:59.459> on<00:03:59.580> the<00:03:59.640> next<00:03:59.819> set<00:04:00.120> and

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
appear then jump on the next set and

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:01.610 
appear then jump on the next set and
jump<00:04:00.510> on<00:04:00.630> the<00:04:00.690> next<00:04:00.810> set<00:04:01.080> and<00:04:01.200> then<00:04:01.440> you're

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620 
jump on the next set and then you're

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.940 
jump on the next set and then you're
safe<00:04:01.830> with<00:04:02.990> off<00:04:03.990> the<00:04:04.170> balls<00:04:04.380> it's<00:04:04.709> like<00:04:04.860> you

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:04.950
