00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:18.240
 November happens to me that if you put in the

 channel searcher hold us going to 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:24.390
 leave because I pass a little bit the 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:27.510
 things as they are and well nothing simply 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.670
 Tell you what I bought in December 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:33.000
 last year already good girls in facts 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:35.880
 there are only five things and of those five 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.340
 things of what we take January that is 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.310
 nothing I bought another one so well I'm going to 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.280
 put it here because really 

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:44.890
 you know 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:47.649
 in the previous one I do not know if really in the 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:49.960
 previous hole you have also a couple of 

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:51.309
 things that I caught in December as well 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.839
 How nice to forgive me but lately 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:56.110
 I have to do it like that or if not things 

00:00:52.839 --> 00:00:59.920
 I do not use them so good in order 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:01.809
 more or less I bought this jumbo from 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.699
 astor that I have already used it in several 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:05.799
 tutorials in this look I take it 

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:07.340
 it's also recorded I'll leave it for 

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:09.890
 here it's worth 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:12.710
 well that's the jumbo they compare with 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.689
 paint early and others are not even remotely 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:17.149
 a lot more pink paint on the ies 

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:19.549
 pink but this is a lot more pink 

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:22.069
 and well I'm going to make you a little 

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:23.840
 Swartz tell you that the tip breaks or 

00:01:22.069 --> 00:01:26.810
 is that there is little point to go sacÃ¡ndole 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:30.200
 a little more or less that's the tone it's worth 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:31.549
 as I tell you and I take it and well 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.289
 is really liking the truth is that 

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:35.630
 I'm using this makeup a lot 

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:38.569
 so I'm using it just enough 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:40.549
 I point out twice so as 

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:43.729
 that the truth that I liked a lot I've 

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:46.159
 bought in mercadona because it was 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:47.959
 three euros so the truth is that it is 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:50.149
 pretty good another thing that I had to 

00:01:47.959 --> 00:01:54.590
 buying this was by necessity this was 

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:56.659
 base is the signature and I have already made a pro 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:59.420
 be a complete look more trying 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:02.210
 products in which I use it so 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:04.369
 I'll leave it here too for 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:05.570
 around here on the screen and forgive me 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:08.060
 to touch my hair but it is that each 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:10.360
 Once I alder I do what gives you the 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:12.700
 wins and gives me a lot of courage 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:16.060
 this is tone 120 and I was a 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:17.950
 little dark took it today applied in 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.890
 this area that is the one that I carry the 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:24.160
 I have dry so I do not expect anything 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:27.100
 when it is happening and the cold please 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.690
 my allergy be removed because you are 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:30.820
 tired of hearing me I'm also 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:33.880
 tired of saying it and would prefer not to say it 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:35.710
 but it is that it is the consequence that is 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:37.810
 that I bought myself a consequence of that 

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:40.540
 I got that out so well I caught it 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:42.760
 offer in perfumery is clear what for 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:45.220
 the north would be a kind of is lakers 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:47.010
 I think it was I do not know I do not know if it was that u 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:50.040
 another but good 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:52.620
 I'm liking it on the part of not 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.750
 He takes out pellejitos in the areas that 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.310
 I have more dry and good for me 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:58.799
 those areas although I raise a little bit the 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.599
 tone of fact in makeup I have to 

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:02.819
 Now raise the tone a little bit when the 

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:05.040
 use but I have no other option and 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:06.840
 nothing because that the truth is that it is 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:11.430
 liking and like that the offer pille 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:13.470
 I came out for almost seven euros about 740 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:16.439
 I get for 7 euros with 40 so I 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:19.950
 I went to carrefour the great call that 

00:03:16.439 --> 00:03:22.079
 we had all 50% makeup by 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:25.170
 please but do not buy any makeup 

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:26.670
 because I was going for the optical eraser and for 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:29.609
 a couple of little things more that called me the 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:30.930
 attention but I did not know so the truth 

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:33.840
 is that I did not even go with the intention 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:36.629
 to buy it but my tone was 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.609
 look take advantage but hey and I bought the 

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:40.590
 makeup remover that I always use 

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:43.170
 but they have changed the format they have 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:45.420
 changed the 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:46.500
 what is the packaging is really the 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:48.760
 boat is the same what you have changed 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:53.319
 on the sticker and the cap 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:54.939
 I bought two because they are 250 milliliters and 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:58.510
 they cost two euros for four euros 

00:03:54.939 --> 00:04:00.519
 you have half a liter and anyway 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:02.769
 I was 20% so I got some 

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:04.239
 euro 60 each boat I will not teach the 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:05.980
 two because it's silly but good 

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:09.250
 truth is that I use it to take away 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:11.590
 the fattest say the makeup and 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:13.540
 the next one I go and I wash my face or 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:17.019
 just for in the mornings yes what 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:18.970
 I use the hydro cough or so I use 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:21.430
 this to remove the grease from the face 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:24.220
 because if I'm going to wash my face 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:26.889
 in the mornings it dries my skin and this 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:28.930
 kind of things not so I bought good 

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:32.680
 It was this was the pink oil 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:34.030
 mosqueta is worth this 18 cost with 95 and the 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:35.710
 truth is that I was surprised thought that 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:38.500
 it was smaller but it does not bring 50 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:40.330
 milliliters so great what am I 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:41.979
 using in the dry areas of the skin 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:44.860
 and I'm not, I'm noticing it enough and 

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:46.270
 also because of my beloved ones 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:48.250
 corticoids that I'm having to 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:50.470
 ingest me friends are coming out 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:52.930
 the whole face see here one see I know that 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:53.800
 a few others here especially in the 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:55.900
 area is 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:57.879
 in which attacks I am using 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:01.180
 because they are leaving me marquitas vale 

00:04:57.879 --> 00:05:02.860
 and a relative of mine told me that they are 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:04.560
 using and from certain scars of 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:07.900
 operations we are reducing them 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:10.389
 so nothing I'm using I wear it 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:13.389
 a matter of a week using it so 

00:05:10.389 --> 00:05:16.840
 I can not say much and well let's see 

00:05:13.389 --> 00:05:19.720
 how are we going put here in ingredients 

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:23.199
 rosehip and sets the precedent of a 

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:24.639
 remove from organic farming so 

00:05:23.199 --> 00:05:26.440
 is one hundred percent in rose oil 

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:28.870
 moisturizing firming and 

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:31.690
 regenerator can not go more because 

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:33.370
 the truth is that you notice me 

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:36.580
 It hydrates a lot but the regenerator 

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:37.990
 I still have not noticed it and the last 

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:40.659
 I buy good to see, I'm not going to 

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:44.500
 lie really if you buy another 

00:05:40.659 --> 00:05:46.150
 thing but it has been online and something small 

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:48.490
 so I'll teach it in a makeup 

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:50.919
 because it's about makeup things 

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:54.190
 so I 'll do a makeup saying 

00:05:50.919 --> 00:05:58.150
 I bought this and already 

00:05:54.190 --> 00:06:00.000
 I went to the because my shampoo that is this to 

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:02.760
 watch 

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.840
 is the no-trace is a shampoo that 

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:05.250
 I've done quite well for the 

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:07.410
 Peeling but I am already 

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:09.900
 finishing because I have to intersperse 

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:11.730
 with by hair hairdressers because yes 

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:13.260
 that is true that after the dogs 

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:15.300
 hairdressers are controlling me quite 

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:16.680
 well the fat but what is the part of 

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:18.390
 the dermatitis that I have on the leather 

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:20.040
 scalp because that evidently does not 

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:22.800
 try and it is the truth is that it is 

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:25.620
 going well I'm inserting it and I 

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:27.600
 like so good the next one as not 

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:28.950
 I stand a lot in order is the truth 

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:33.000
 things as they are 

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:35.940
 I caught the jumping and um and pp I do not know 

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:40.910
 what it's called in Spanish is that it was 

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:40.910
 well and it is such that it is 

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:47.460
 OK 

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:48.930
 and well this smells a lot better 

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:51.540
 cooler and this what it does also 

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:53.340
 good to control that desquamation already 

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:55.890
 the time that also controls the fat in 

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:57.690
 the scalp so nothing in fact 

00:06:55.890 --> 00:07:02.100
 I bought it on December 30th that was 

00:06:57.690 --> 00:07:05.310
 the day of my birthday so me anything 

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:08.370
 I liked it, I liked it, not because 

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:10.800
 I have not tried this on what you're thinking 

00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:12.780
 I liked it if I liked more the smell of this 

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:14.880
 that of the other so as they have 

00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:16.590
 very similar functions there is this 

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:18.540
 until the other one finishes 

00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:21.240
 obviously I will not start it but 

00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:23.520
 I want when I finish that and finish this 

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:25.830
 time of year to use all of the 

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:28.260
 with which the hairdressers and for 

00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:30.630
 tell you something so totally true 

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:32.220
 that used on those products well 

00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:34.919
 that nothing I think I've made a mess of 

00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:36.979
 final but you understand me or you are already 

00:07:34.919 --> 00:07:40.110
 used to my messes and my boyfriends 

00:07:36.979 --> 00:07:42.660
 tell you again that this makeup that 

00:07:40.110 --> 00:07:44.100
 you are watching is recorded so good 

00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:46.610
 do not ask me what they had 

00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:48.840
 because it's around here things are like that 

00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:51.300
 I hope you liked this video
