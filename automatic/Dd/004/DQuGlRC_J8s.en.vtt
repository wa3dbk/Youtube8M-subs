00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:04.160 
couple weeks ago people if you take a
look<00:02:01.500> you<00:02:02.159> can<00:02:02.219> see<00:02:02.460> the<00:02:02.579> wires<00:02:02.820> are<00:02:03.240> kind<00:02:04.079> of

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
look you can see the wires are kind of

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.700 
look you can see the wires are kind of
hammered<00:02:04.640> so

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:06.710 
hammered so

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:08.859 
hammered so
I<00:02:06.830> did<00:02:07.490> tickle<00:02:07.850> the<00:02:07.940> starter<00:02:08.330> and<00:02:08.450> the<00:02:08.539> starter

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869 
I did tickle the starter and the starter

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:11.020 
I did tickle the starter and the starter
does<00:02:09.050> go<00:02:09.200> around<00:02:09.530> when<00:02:09.679> you<00:02:09.770> put<00:02:09.950> power<00:02:10.580> to<00:02:10.880> it

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
does go around when you put power to it

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.140 
does go around when you put power to it
that's<00:02:11.569> a<00:02:11.720> good<00:02:11.870> thing<00:02:12.550> but<00:02:13.550> I<00:02:13.610> had<00:02:13.790> to<00:02:13.850> tickle

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
that's a good thing but I had to tickle

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.960 
that's a good thing but I had to tickle
the<00:02:14.240> starter<00:02:14.600> here<00:02:15.020> I<00:02:15.200> hooked<00:02:16.190> it<00:02:16.310> up<00:02:16.490> and<00:02:16.700> hit

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
the starter here I hooked it up and hit

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:19.030 
the starter here I hooked it up and hit
the<00:02:17.000> key<00:02:17.360> and<00:02:18.140> he<00:02:18.200> pushed<00:02:18.470> the<00:02:18.620> button<00:02:18.650> it

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
the key and he pushed the button it

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.830 
the key and he pushed the button it
didn't<00:02:19.340> do<00:02:19.459> anything<00:02:19.700> so<00:02:20.150> it<00:02:20.480> does<00:02:20.630> have

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
didn't do anything so it does have
