walgreens was a foundation because we

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:29.870

foundation<00:00:30.269> so<00:00:31.230> I<00:00:31.260> decided<00:00:31.740> to<00:00:31.920> go<00:00:32.040> with<00:00:32.189> the

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:33.620 
foundation so I decided to go with the
Rimmel<00:00:32.669> stay<00:00:32.790> matte<00:00:32.910> liquid<00:00:33.300> mousse

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
foundation which is fairly new and I

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.700 
foundation which is fairly new and I
decided<00:00:36.570> to<00:00:36.750> go<00:00:36.840> with<00:00:36.930> this<00:00:37.110> because<00:00:37.440> it<00:00:37.559> does

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
decided to go with this because it does

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.979 
decided to go with this because it does
it's<00:00:37.890> very<00:00:38.100> lightweight<00:00:38.430> and<00:00:38.850> it's<00:00:39.210> also<00:00:39.420> mad

of<00:00:47.489> my<00:00:47.730> hand<00:00:48.030> I<00:00:48.270> took<00:00:48.539> my<00:00:48.899> finger<00:00:49.170> and<00:00:49.379> then<00:00:49.469> I

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
of my hand I took my finger and then I

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.470 
of my hand I took my finger and then I
dotted<00:00:49.950> little<00:00:50.340> dots<00:00:50.550> all<00:00:50.820> around<00:00:51.120> my<00:00:51.210> face

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
dotted little dots all around my face

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.660 
dotted little dots all around my face
because<00:00:51.960> a<00:00:52.110> little<00:00:52.410> goes<00:00:52.559> a<00:00:53.160> long<00:00:53.190> way<00:00:53.520> with

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
because a little goes a long way with

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.189 
because a little goes a long way with
this<00:00:53.730> foundation<00:00:54.420> it's<00:00:54.629> definitely<00:00:55.020> really

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
this foundation it's definitely really

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:56.799 
this foundation it's definitely really
buildable<00:00:55.710> it's<00:00:56.039> medium<00:00:56.430> to<00:00:56.550> full<00:00:56.730> coverage

00:00:56.799 --> 00:00:56.809 
buildable it's medium to full coverage

00:00:56.809 --> 00:00:59.959 
buildable it's medium to full coverage
so<00:00:57.809> after<00:00:58.199> I<00:00:58.230> dotted<00:00:58.530> the<00:00:58.680> dots<00:00:59.039> on<00:00:59.280> my<00:00:59.309> face<00:00:59.699> I

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
so after I dotted the dots on my face I

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.389 
so after I dotted the dots on my face I
just<00:01:00.239> basically<00:01:00.629> you<00:01:00.899> know<00:01:01.020> took<00:01:01.079> a<00:01:01.469> buffing

because after foundation we have to

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.590 
because after foundation we have to
apply<00:01:10.619> some<00:01:10.830> concealer<00:01:10.950> and<00:01:11.610> I<00:01:11.939> decided<00:01:12.299> to<00:01:12.479> go

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
apply some concealer and I decided to go

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.270 
apply some concealer and I decided to go
with<00:01:12.689> the<00:01:12.810> l'oreal<00:01:13.170> visible<00:01:13.590> if<00:01:13.740> CC<00:01:14.250> eye

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.120 
applied it to the lashes and very

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.689
