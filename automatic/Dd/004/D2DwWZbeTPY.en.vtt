00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 Hello everyone, today I want to do you 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.640
 see how to make little flowers 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.859
 using the film the help and the 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.630
 enamels these little brothers can 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.519
 come in handy to go decorate 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.200
 many types of support 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.210
 indeed even to make us necklaces and 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.160
 bracelets for this project vi 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.320
 we need glazes of various colors 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.449
 the iron wire a support of 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.519
 polystyrene that you can go and get 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.500
 or from some packaging or else from 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.990
 trays that used from food 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.990
 then a pen a pencil or otherwise a 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:33.510
 support with a round handle one 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:36.360
 toothpick or an open paper clip 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.920
 as in this case and two types of pliers 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.320
 one to go and cut the thread of 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.950
 iron and another to go to one 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.600
 form 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.399
 let's first see the philly fed al 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.500
 our support with the rotorno handle 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.950
 we leave a little piece of thread 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:53.340
 at the beginning and let's create a slot 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:56.270
 around the handle so we then give two 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.270
 rounds to close 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:05.080
 we continue the other petals with the 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:06.700
 same technique and makes it from four 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:09.940
 round I still make you king 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:16.960
 procedure support my pencil ride 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:19.650
 around the wire and do two laps for 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.650
 shut it 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:31.080
 and then I still support the pencil I do 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:31.080
 the only one with the thread 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:35.890
 and then around 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:02:01.680
 cut at the ends and turn around 

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:01.680
 the children 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:10.420
 Now let's get back to the polish we have 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.590
 chosen and we go to form the petals 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:18.820
 we understand the brush so that 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:18.820
 it is very full and we pass it on the petal 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.430
 you see that an enamel film will form 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:31.080
 that will color the weigh it 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.080
 so we also decide for others 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:42.280
 when we finished all the petals 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:44.170
 let's go to turn the flower a little so 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:48.540
 that the enamel goes to deposit 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:48.540
 evenly throughout the pit in Rome 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.459
 after a few seconds we will see that it 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.069
 enamel would not be moving 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:03:00.049
 inside the petal and therefore we can 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:00.049
 put to dry on polystyrene 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:05.190
 let's do another kind of 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:06.510
 flower or the one with the petals 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:08.400
 elongated 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:12.239
 let's go then to make five petals with 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:14.549
 method that I showed you first with 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:18.769
 the pliers go to the form to ours 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:18.769
 petals then we crush them to the sides 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:36.510
 then always with pliers or simply 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:39.140
 with the fingers we go to give it a shape 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:39.140
 at altitude 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:49.060
 also here as states but we pass the 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:51.269
 Benin stained enamel brush to give 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:51.269
 color 

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:08.490
 and we turn to make the enamel uniform 

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:18.520
 when the first layer dries 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:18.520
 we can then move on to the second hand 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:27.330
 and even with a toothpick and a 

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:31.430
 other color 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:31.430
 we can go on to give nuances 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:41.970
 then me some if you want you can go to 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:45.140
 reach one with a little glue 

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:45.140
 bead in the center 

00:04:55.129 --> 00:05:00.199
 as you have seen these little flowers are 

00:04:57.559 --> 00:05:01.909
 really very simple to make in 

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:03.529
 more like I said before you can 

00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:05.479
 use to go to decorate 

00:05:03.529 --> 00:05:08.719
 a multitude of things such as 

00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:11.209
 clothespins brooches pins or centerpieces 

00:05:08.719 --> 00:05:13.189
 all the baskets you want 

00:05:11.209 --> 00:05:15.189
 in my case I will use these creations 

00:05:13.189 --> 00:05:17.569
 to make a beautiful necklace 

00:05:15.189 --> 00:05:19.489
 also using components of a bit 

00:05:17.569 --> 00:05:22.369
 unusual so if you are curious about 

00:05:19.489 --> 00:05:29.809
 know what it will do next follow this 

00:05:22.369 --> 00:05:31.610
 tutorial that I put here said this 

00:05:29.809 --> 00:05:33.889
 I hope this tutorial is 

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:36.019
 liked let me know the comments june 

00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:38.059

00:05:36.019 --> 00:05:40.009
 above all, what does de corato see us? 

00:05:38.059 --> 00:05:41.779
