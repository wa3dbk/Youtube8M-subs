and then just slow it down a little bit
by<00:01:19.539> leaning<00:01:19.780> backwards<00:01:20.850> that's<00:01:21.850> it<00:01:22.560> it<00:01:23.560> will

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:23.740 
by leaning backwards that's it it will

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:25.410 
by leaning backwards that's it it will
sort<00:01:24.039> of<00:01:24.100> take<00:01:24.250> you<00:01:24.399> in<00:01:24.549> little<00:01:24.789> tours

00:01:28.529 --> 00:01:28.539 
sometimes the left the right because the

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:31.169 
sometimes the left the right because the
undulations<00:01:28.780> in<00:01:29.170> the<00:01:29.229> ground<00:01:29.439> but<00:01:30.179> you're

00:01:31.169 --> 00:01:31.179 
undulations in the ground but you're

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:33.029 
undulations in the ground but you're
pretty<00:01:31.420> well<00:01:32.259> you<00:01:32.320> know<00:01:32.439> nowadays<00:01:32.799> it's

00:01:33.029 --> 00:01:33.039 
pretty well you know nowadays it's

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:37.260

pretty<00:01:33.220> stable<00:01:35.789> that's<00:01:36.789> good<00:01:36.970> though<00:01:37.119> because

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:37.270 
pretty stable that's good though because

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:38.700 
pretty stable that's good though because
you'll<00:01:37.569> learn<00:01:37.720> to<00:01:37.869> cut<00:01:38.020> at<00:01:38.110> the<00:01:38.170> wobble<00:01:38.409> that

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:38.710

you're having back and forth back and
forth

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:39.909 
forth

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:42.929

that's<00:01:40.030> all<00:01:40.179> business<00:01:40.450> I<00:01:41.520> think<00:01:42.520> I<00:01:42.610> might<00:01:42.789> give

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:42.939 
that's all business I think I might give

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:45.840 
that's all business I think I might give
you<00:01:42.969> a<00:01:43.090> bit<00:01:43.179> of<00:01:43.210> a<00:01:43.329> leap<00:01:43.509> onto<00:01:44.490> not<00:01:45.490> doing<00:01:45.759> that

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850 
you a bit of a leap onto not doing that

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:50.130 
you a bit of a leap onto not doing that
when<00:01:46.030> it's<00:01:46.149> got<00:01:46.329> no<00:01:46.450> wheels<00:01:46.600> on<00:01:46.810> it<00:01:49.020> bit<00:01:50.020> of<00:01:50.080> a

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.140 
when it's got no wheels on it bit of a

00:01:50.140 --> 00:02:02.339 
when it's got no wheels on it bit of a
bump<00:01:50.319> there<00:01:53.580> saw<00:01:54.580> some<00:01:54.729> speed<00:01:55.030> on<00:02:01.349> just

00:02:02.339 --> 00:02:02.349 
bump there saw some speed on just

00:02:02.349 --> 00:02:34.110 
bump there saw some speed on just
turning<00:02:02.649> really<00:02:02.799> good<00:02:02.920> other<00:02:03.039> way<00:02:03.130> now<00:02:33.120> Yankel

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
turning really good other way now Yankel

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:40.210 
turning really good other way now Yankel
that<00:02:34.239> wobble<00:02:34.540> soon<00:02:34.750> enough<00:02:35.049> er<00:02:35.739> initially
