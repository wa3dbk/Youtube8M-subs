00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:09.000
 hello ladies and gentlemen 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.790
 if me look yes we are today we will 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:16.770
 study with you mowgli not looking 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:19.439
 the fact that here it is just yes oh their 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.000
 really full of a lot but all 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.189
 ask for the type of rusta you 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.740
 back bush hand boldly on palmflip not 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.630
 took off subscribing there slid down here and i 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.840
 decided not to slide down and unsubscribe to 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:33.719
 nights remove the splint on palm flip and 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:36.120
 also low palm flip claws dad filmed 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.489
 I will explain in more detail how it is 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.890
 vodka is made without them there and the 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:43.800
 like normal with a bear 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:46.190
 balalaika and how you need it looks like 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.190
 element 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:55.710
 let's start learning dudes and what 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:01:00.199
 important in this element to be able to riddle 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:02.520
 I think I 'll show the back somersault 

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:04.140
 must be able to back flip 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.909
 because if you can't rear 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.390
 somersault then there is no point in learning 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:12.119
 the item then what you need back 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:15.509
 somersault is the second time you need it 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:19.320
 as much as a swoop on the back with a hand 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:23.250
 the song is inside that is you 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.590
 jump with one hand and it was not 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.700
 right on the wall 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:31.939
 and then in this case you just fit and 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:34.070
 naprygivat already on the wall at the very 

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:37.860
 so look 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:40.640
 We approach and the distance generally choose 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:43.170
 yourself but desirable 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:46.350
 something like this means look growth 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:49.909
 on well two feet 3 watch and foot 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:54.299
 I push code so I run up 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:56.130
 on the third foot of the wall 3 foot note 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:59.570
 because there are dudes that fit 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:03.630
 very close and straight but where do 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:06.240
 pouf do you crash there on the wall 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.110
 knees tamga faces all head 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.710
 please fight 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:13.380
 and still crayfish which I generally do far 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:15.870
 and just imprinted into the wall 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:20.250
 good luck look we need to pick up 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:21.590
 average distance for an item in my 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.870
 case 33 feet 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:25.770
 then what do we need we need a push on 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:30.900
 the element itself 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:34.080
 that is, we run up and push that is 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:37.500
 just pushes a little bit 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:40.350
 a little forward and focus on 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:43.530
 because the higher you fly up and the 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:45.660
 higher you will have sunken flip so much the better and 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:48.420
 clearer you get up on it pay special 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:51.630
 attention means then what you need 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:55.740
 rear and all that is, see run up 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:58.830
 such and come to the night pushing up 

00:02:55.740 --> 00:03:01.500
 and put forward a little in my hands 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:07.070
 case here 's how flour is put that is 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:12.510
 it's head and palm head and palm 

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:18.500
 pushing go back and everything is simple 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:21.450
 but mistakes errors of major fears tolcan 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:23.870
 immediately cast up and do ass q it 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:27.230
 shit dudes don't do run away 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:33.930
 viewer obstacle until the moment 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:37.070
 repel faster by no means 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:41.100
 come up and immediately twist and start 

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:42.660
 it is very important and principle everything that is 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:46.880
 we fit you feet 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:48.690
 push up a little bit forward pack of arm 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:54.620
 look at the hands 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:58.740
 when want palm palm 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:59.280
 end on the back and basically everything is all 

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:02.209
 pomfrey 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:05.970
 run now let's go 

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:10.440
 look here in our case lane from 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:13.080
 her we will learn what is important low 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:15.630
 pawn clip to crouch is important when network 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:17.190
 because if you do so will you 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:19.700
 fly into this obstacle not for 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:20.880
 just do nothing at all 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:24.590
 after all 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:27.900
 and there is one cheat let's call it che there 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:30.900
 hold and legs on low palmflip not 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:33.960
 right that is not like in the back but through 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:37.040
 god it's just a freebie dude free just 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:40.470
 free element, that is, such 

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:42.720
 squat it is important to sit it is important 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:44.460
 because we are with reason pushing and 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:48.050
 we due to this departure appears 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:52.290
 crouch such hands hold 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:56.430
 case as the site you flip also 

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:58.260
 we derive ourselves legs through god and shoulders too 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:00.150
 it can be easier in a year 

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:01.800
 look at which plane and how you 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:03.540
 turn around because if he is right there 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:04.020
 harder to catch this moment that is 

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:09.810
 look 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:13.530
 fit such squat pushing it 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:16.370
 moj him them yourself how it will look 

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:16.370
 in real life 

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:34.520
 through god is much easier to spin and you 

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:37.520
 see vaine the whole moment of twist but if 

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:39.940
 you want to clearly can clearly do 

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:43.490
 right but i don't right because 

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:45.950
 twists above all slower and you don't 

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:48.320
 see the moment itself twist through god when 

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:50.180
 you make you see everything look like 

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:52.370
 grab a lot of how much you have left 

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:54.800
 fly like land and so on and on 

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:58.070
 at the same time through the palmflip block by itself 

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:59.930
 looks much stronger than usual 

00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:00.710
 In principle, everything I wanted today with 

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:02.420
 to share with you 

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:04.490
 subscribe to the put put likes channel 

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:07.310
 repost tanks in the comments write what 

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:10.940
 he is not clear i will explain and so on and 

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:14.300
 something like that you can write about alimony 

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:17.360
 which tutors would like to see but not 

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:18.770
 write type butt there bykovu hopi rarely 

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:22.910
 these are boys 

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:25.970
 that you do not write on the shorter 

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:28.580
 the standard element of this is the intestines 

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:32.000
 either those for which there is really no tawaf 

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:35.230
 and you are not you can not teach it all 

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.230
 bye everyone 

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:48.349
 This is approximately what it looks like. 

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:51.349
 element and now let's get started 

00:06:48.349 --> 00:06:51.349
 studying
