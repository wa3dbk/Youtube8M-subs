 small municipality of silveiras at the foot of 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.800
 the mouth of the mouth a proposal well 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.750
 Interesting restaurant with 20 seats 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.180
 It's where I cook the ingredients of 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.129
 environment without technical restriction or 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.780
 nothing a nice free kitchen I know 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.879
 that the recipe we have cod né 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.430
 has the restaurant version as is the 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.770
 see for your family dish is a recipe 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.800
 of my grandmother's family is a 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:52.140
 cod is quite different from the risotto 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.149
 take it with a completely 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:01:01.079
 different you'll like 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:01:03.449
 Let's go, this time it's now they 're all 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.610
 here separated beautifully and the first 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.049
 thing is to put the broth to 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.560
 important when we start 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:14.760
 make the recipe whatever the case is already 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:17.490
 and the calabrian sausage is time to 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.259
 cut so that it is well 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.790
 that it can dissolve the 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.790
 taste of sausage on a rock 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:28.760
 Good folks got sausage now for 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:30.940
 make life easier stay the others 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:30.940
 Ingredients 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.460
 is the block he has the talent has the 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.740
 flowers 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.290
 I like to cut the stalks look only 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.970
 very thin because they are a little 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:48.570
 the firmer the time of profession 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:51.869
 different cuts the hair well end here 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:55.259
 finished the path only has azores produces 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:57.710
 two or three cut bruised form is 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.710
 more than enough 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:07.900
 chopped ingredients put panela no 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.910
 fire 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:13.120
 now the next I'll put the fire 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:14.440
 strong enough to heat the pan but I 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.680
 I'm going to put the fire down as soon as 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:20.970
 ingredients of an important detail 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:24.400
 olive oil that I put in the beginning is just 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:27.970
 a third of the amount of oil very 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:30.700
 good trade with the onion and I go 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:37.900
 sauté the onion until it starts to 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:41.340
 translucent to get in with garlic and 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.340
 immediately with rice 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.100
 now you have to keep an eye on why 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:47.980
 rice to change color 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:50.350
 He's going to pass this body of rice. 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.410
 raw to a milky white so I go 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:55.840
 have to keep stirring and have to remember 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:58.180
 low can smell the garlic 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:00.970
 feeling is awesome and the rice 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:04.390
 Look, it just completely changed the color of the law. 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:06.549
 everyone is watching the sausage 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:08.859
 It's interesting that it's worth investing in rice 

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:12.160
 of cod is not the magazine mixers is 

00:03:08.859 --> 00:03:13.660
 a widely used combination of this recipe 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:16.060
 a family recipe a recipe 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:18.250
 Portuguese 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:21.350
 It takes the bologna's it 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:25.390
 result is super interesting at the end 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:25.390
 I wish I was a virgin 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:32.230
 agrovila for sale 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.920
 He covered and that 's how I'm going to stop doing 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:39.680
 a first jump correction plus or 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:42.110
 less half the amount I want 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:45.950
 draw attention to the point of rice 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:47.330
 rice is still change but see if you 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:49.730
 can feel that he has begun to 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:52.250
 announce this only five minutes of 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:56.300
 cooking noticed to us even with 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:04:01.070
 the own mourinho but already sum 35 

00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:04.280
 minutes, Carlos appeared on the surface. 

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:06.380
 the club again with the car always 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:08.540
 Seeing cause of the surface is very 

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:13.150
 important that this dish is a 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:13.150
 juicy plate above all else said 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:19.820
 Let's work now though the cod 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:20.870
 which are on the sides of the 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:26.630
 cod slivers 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:27.919
 I will put the lion as I want it 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:30.140
 our greatest 

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:37.130
 I'll be careful when you move, do not stay. 

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:39.800
 very stuck so I think right here check 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:46.630
 or if the broth is on the surface 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:46.630
 if I have a little correction and now 

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:53.150
 10 minute cool cap is interesting 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:54.919
 this thing of cod rice is because 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:56.810
 he is different from cod risotto 

00:04:54.919 --> 00:04:59.690
 with the difference between rice 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:02.840
 risotto the risotto is a classic dish 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:04.310
 Italian a dish that has a one method 

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:06.919
 of very specific preparation usually 

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:08.870
 takes butter takes a type of rice 

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:12.080
 specific also some types of rice 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:13.760
 of specific rice wine is another 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:15.500
 differential also the risotto a plate of 

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:18.320
 winter 4 that finished with cheese 

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:20.270
 more greasy parmesan more intense 

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:22.460
 I think the rice is more given our 

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:25.750
 hottest Brazilian palate I 

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:25.750
 I prefer treasure rice 

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:36.430
 Now give me a look I have 

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:38.560
 that broth at half height 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:39.160
 this is the end point of the 

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:40.780
 dish 

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:43.390
 only it is important to prove a 

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:45.130
 bit of the rice with the broth in my 

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:48.040
 opinion is missing a bit of 

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:49.750
 jump that I'm going to fix now is 

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:51.400
 important to be aware of this because 

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:53.080
 cod a marçal né 

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:54.760
 cod has an impressive range of 

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:55.960
 of salt only one piece higher and more 

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:57.400
 close to the tail 

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:58.750
 depending on the lot that came to the 

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:59.740
 importer cod has a variation 

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:02.530
 in the new edition 

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:05.190
 then this final adjustment is the cat's leap 

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:05.190
 cool 

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:12.540
 I finish with the chives with the rest 

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:16.230
 of olive oil two thirds the touch of pepper 

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:16.230
 and olive 

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:37.110
 Sergio 

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:38.160
 and everything was promising the smell of 

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:41.040
 cod while we are 

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:43.730
 cooking is fulfilled here at once 

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:48.270
 that people try on men's plate with 

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:50.940
 Look how the sausage looks subtle. 

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:53.669
 a scream on the plate and it really is more 

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:55.410
 than the much lighter risotto and the 

00:06:53.669 --> 00:06:57.720
 creaminess is one's own rice 

00:06:55.410 --> 00:07:01.229
 bit of cod protein one 

00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:02.970
 delicious light dish this cast 

00:07:01.229 --> 00:07:04.979
 I can not wait to come back here for more 

00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:07.400
 a recipe that we'll be back soon 

00:07:04.979 --> 00:07:07.400
 that's it
