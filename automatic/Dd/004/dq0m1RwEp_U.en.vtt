on to Nova that's pretty simple to do in
all<00:01:20.700> fairness<00:01:20.939> with<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.630> cyber<00:01:21.840> dragon<00:01:22.229> deck

the machine dupe for example going to
Nova<00:01:26.040> overlay<00:01:26.400> into<00:01:26.610> this<00:01:26.729> first<00:01:27.150> Effect<00:01:27.540> 2

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810

Nova overlay into this first Effect 2
into<00:01:28.020> attack<00:01:28.229> for<00:01:28.439> each<00:01:28.680> material<00:01:29.369> attached

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
into attack for each material attached

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.819 
into attack for each material attached
to<00:01:30.270> it<00:01:30.360> so<00:01:30.600> already<00:01:30.990> it's<00:01:31.200> gonna<00:01:31.409> get<00:01:31.560> like<00:01:31.680> an

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
to it so already it's gonna get like an

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.249 
to it so already it's gonna get like an
800<00:01:32.310> boost<00:01:32.520> straight<00:01:33.180> off<00:01:33.299> the<00:01:33.420> bat<00:01:33.630> then

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
800 boost straight off the bat then

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:35.359 
800 boost straight off the bat then
you're<00:01:34.439> probably<00:01:34.530> gonna<00:01:34.770> activate<00:01:35.189> its

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
you're probably gonna activate its

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.940 
you're probably gonna activate its
effect<00:01:35.490> to<00:01:36.420> steal<00:01:36.990> the<00:01:37.110> monster<00:01:37.439> on<00:01:37.470> board<00:01:37.590> so

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
effect to steal the monster on board so

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.469 
effect to steal the monster on board so
it's<00:01:38.070> gonna<00:01:38.159> go<00:01:38.340> up<00:01:38.369> to<00:01:38.670> a<00:01:38.700> thousand

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
it's gonna go up to a thousand

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:40.940 
it's gonna go up to a thousand
so<00:01:39.720> that<00:01:39.840> fight<00:01:40.020> it's<00:01:40.110> gonna<00:01:40.200> be<00:01:40.350> on<00:01:40.439> three<00:01:40.710> one

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
so that fight it's gonna be on three one

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.249 
so that fight it's gonna be on three one
that's<00:01:41.430> pretty<00:01:41.820> beefy<00:01:42.119> and<00:01:42.509> then<00:01:43.020> not<00:01:43.229> only

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
that's pretty beefy and then not only

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.590 
that's pretty beefy and then not only
that<00:01:43.500> you<00:01:43.829> can<00:01:43.860> negate<00:01:44.670> things<00:01:45.240> you<00:01:45.450> can

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
that you can negate things you can

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.600 
that you can negate things you can
basically<00:01:45.840> have<00:01:46.140> a<00:01:46.290> howler<00:01:46.829> perfection<00:01:47.460> on

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
basically have a howler perfection on

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.690 
basically have a howler perfection on
board<00:01:48.360> that<00:01:48.780> is<00:01:48.930> beating<00:01:49.439> you<00:01:49.619> down<00:01:49.649> this<00:01:50.399> card

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700

board presence to the deck in my opinion

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.559 
board presence to the deck in my opinion
it<00:02:43.829> means<00:02:44.040> you<00:02:44.310> can't<00:02:44.549> hold<00:02:44.760> on<00:02:45.120> to<00:02:45.150> that

00:02:49.859 --> 00:02:53.420 
not going for an OT case straight away
it<00:02:50.489> means<00:02:50.849> that<00:02:51.659> you<00:02:51.840> can<00:02:52.109> safely<00:02:52.769> let<00:02:53.280> your

thing is you're going to be able to

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.550 
thing is you're going to be able to
negate<00:03:04.609> effects<00:03:05.609> with<00:03:06.090> it<00:03:06.239> and<00:03:06.599> now<00:03:07.049> let's<00:03:07.319> not

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
negate effects with it and now let's not

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.970 
negate effects with it and now let's not
forget<00:03:07.980> how<00:03:08.669> it<00:03:08.970> reads<00:03:09.329> once<00:03:10.200> per<00:03:10.500> turn<00:03:10.530> during

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
forget how it reads once per turn during

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.539 
forget how it reads once per turn during
either<00:03:11.250> player's<00:03:11.579> turn<00:03:11.989> that<00:03:12.989> saves<00:03:13.889> the<00:03:14.310> card

00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:14.549 
either player's turn that saves the card

either player's turn that saves the card
from<00:03:14.849> being<00:03:15.030> broken<00:03:15.269> if<00:03:15.599> it<00:03:15.720> was<00:03:15.989> like<00:03:16.500> how<00:03:16.829> the

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:16.889 
from being broken if it was like how the

00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:18.979 
from being broken if it was like how the
perfection<00:03:17.489> where<00:03:17.699> you<00:03:17.970> just<00:03:18.180> attached<00:03:18.569> until

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
perfection where you just attached until

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:20.479 
perfection where you just attached until
you<00:03:19.079> basically<00:03:19.620> your<00:03:19.739> hand<00:03:19.889> on<00:03:20.069> you<00:03:20.220> can<00:03:20.370> do<00:03:20.459> it

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489 
you basically your hand on you can do it

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:22.430 
you basically your hand on you can do it
multiple<00:03:20.819> times<00:03:20.879> on<00:03:21.180> the<00:03:21.239> chain<00:03:21.540> that<00:03:22.199> will<00:03:22.379> be

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
multiple times on the chain that will be

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:23.300 
multiple times on the chain that will be
ridiculous

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
ridiculous

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:25.009 
ridiculous
the<00:03:23.729> fact<00:03:23.970> that<00:03:24.030> this<00:03:24.180> is<00:03:24.359> one<00:03:24.510> sport<00:03:24.690> injuring

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:25.019 
the fact that this is one sport injuring

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:27.080 
the fact that this is one sport injuring
either<00:03:25.260> players<00:03:25.620> say<00:03:25.829> means<00:03:26.040> that<00:03:26.220> it<00:03:26.340> can<00:03:26.639> be

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
either players say means that it can be

built-in<00:03:29.310> destruction<00:03:30.000> maybe<00:03:30.209> like<00:03:30.419> 101

which<00:03:31.079> I<00:03:31.169> would've<00:03:31.409> thought<00:03:31.560> I'd<00:03:31.739> have

which I would've thought I'd have

expected for some unknown reason but the

00:03:34.889 --> 00:03:36.770 
expected for some unknown reason but the
card<00:03:35.159> is<00:03:35.310> still<00:03:35.549> great<00:03:35.879> it's<00:03:36.150> a<00:03:36.269> great<00:03:36.510> great
