Make a cardboard bicycle today!

00:00:03.262 --> 00:00:05.644
Maybe not interesting because I just made

00:00:05.941 --> 00:00:09.094
Today is made from cardboard bicycle for 1 hour

00:00:09.094 --> 00:00:10.329
1 hour !?

00:00:10.329 --> 00:00:12.649
This is the way. Tire first. I required this.

00:00:12.649 --> 00:00:16.985
Frame, saddle, handle, bicycle now become

00:00:16.985 --> 00:00:17.902
You're Right

00:00:17.902 --> 00:00:19.264
Pedal not?

00:00:19.264 --> 00:00:20.612
There is no moving parts

00:00:20.612 --> 00:00:22.296
The driving part is...

00:00:22.296 --> 00:00:25.748
Man are riding. Probably foot

00:00:25.748 --> 00:00:27.177
People on board boldly

00:00:27.177 --> 00:00:29.429
So what is riding in the saddle?

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:36.085
I kicked proceed. If it was ones like this, I 
 think you can make in less than an hour

00:00:36.085 --> 00:00:40.572
We'll make a cardboard bike within an hour from now ya!

00:00:40.572 --> 00:00:42.199

00:00:55.752 --> 00:00:57.766
We can do it!

00:00:59.448 --> 00:01:01.172
I'm barely time!

00:01:01.172 --> 00:01:02.455
This works fine

00:01:03.056 --> 00:01:05.503

00:01:05.503 --> 00:01:07.294
Okay, then, let 's go round!

00:01:08.787 --> 00:01:14.184
I'm going to ride! Everyone's dream because it is stuck in

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.728
So, Mr. MEGWIN, please, the dream of everyone!

00:01:23.623 --> 00:01:24.460
You are incorrect

00:01:25.387 --> 00:01:26.753
It'll work yet, right?

00:01:38.047 --> 00:01:40.190
The last was cool, right??

00:01:40.188 --> 00:01:44.550
