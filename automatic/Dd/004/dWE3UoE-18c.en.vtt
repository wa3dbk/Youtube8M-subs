00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.960
 "Mercury Climbs" 

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:06.600
 No mercury in the body can really be considered safe. 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.860
 This expert opinion on the harmful effects of mercury from fish indicated that "even a slight increase." 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.160
 Exposure to methylmercury from the environment in the form of fish can result 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:19.560
 adverse effects on nervous system development, as well as lead. " 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.860
 The zero lead level is the only correct one, the same is true for mercury. 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:28.880
 They point out this famous study published in the Journal of Pediatrics a few years ago. 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:34.520
 The study shows delayed stem auditory evoked potentials (BAEP) in adolescents 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:39.480
 exposed to methylmercury. BAEP is used for objective neurobehavioral measurement 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.200
 toxicity, in this case 14-year-old children exposed to fish during the development of methylmercury. 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.860
 Examination measures how well the nerves in the brain communicate with each other. 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:50.800
 Take the children, put the electrodes on the scalp and put on the ears. 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.760
 You will have a short auditory stimulus in your headphones. 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.060
 Then it is measured how long it takes for the sound to be transferred from the nerves in the ear 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:02.780
 to the cortical auditory center in the brain. 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:07.660
 The longer the delay, the slower the nerve impulses are transmitted to you. 

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:09.380
 Here's the graph. 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.340
 Here you see a delay in the mercury content of hair. 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.040
 You'll probably notice two things. 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:19.300
 The more mercury the children have in the body, the longer the delay. 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:20.360
 It is bad. 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.160
 You will also notice that it is essentially a straight line. 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:29.980
 At the bottom of it, the less mercury you have in the body, the better. 

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:33.880
 Where would we mark a safety limit on this chart? 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.600
 In 1978, the World Health Organization (WHO) began to realize 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:43.280
 how dangerous dangerous mercury is. Therefore, they set a limit on this level. 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:44.580
 We didn't have better information then. 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:49.620
 In decades, the upper "safe" boundary has shifted somewhat lower. 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:53.960
 In 2001, our government said our children are very valuable, 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.580
 and lowered the limit to this value. 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:04.140
 As is evident from these newer findings, if you press the levels below, 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.940
 you make people eat less fish, there will be less brain damage. 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:14.800
 Yet in 2012, the security limit remains at this value. 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:20.020
 As one former EPA toxicologist said in the Wall Street Journal: 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:26.000
 "Government regulators indeed serve the fishing industry rather than the US."
