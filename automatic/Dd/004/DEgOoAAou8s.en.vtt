00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:05.370 
good at playing any instrument I played

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:07.820 
good at playing any instrument I played
lots<00:00:05.580> of<00:00:05.819> instruments<00:00:06.120> but<00:00:07.020> I<00:00:07.049> wanted<00:00:07.560> to<00:00:07.620> make

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
lots of instruments but I wanted to make

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.430 
lots of instruments but I wanted to make
music<00:00:08.010> as<00:00:08.490> a<00:00:08.550> composer<00:00:09.090> before<00:00:09.510> I<00:00:09.990> learned

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
music as a composer before I learned

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:11.570 
music as a composer before I learned
anything<00:00:10.620> about<00:00:11.010> how<00:00:11.099> to<00:00:11.190> play<00:00:11.400> an<00:00:11.490> instrument

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
anything about how to play an instrument

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.189 
anything about how to play an instrument
I<00:00:12.440> think<00:00:13.440> what<00:00:13.590> happens<00:00:14.130> though<00:00:14.519> I<00:00:15.360> think

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
I think what happens though I think

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.950 
I think what happens though I think
everybody<00:00:16.680> can<00:00:16.859> be<00:00:17.010> a<00:00:17.039> composer<00:00:17.460> and<00:00:17.940> I<00:00:18.750> think

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
everybody can be a composer and I think

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.120 
everybody can be a composer and I think
really<00:00:19.109> everybody<00:00:19.590> can<00:00:19.770> be<00:00:19.859> a<00:00:19.890> musician

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
really everybody can be a musician

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:21.260 
really everybody can be a musician
whether<00:00:20.550> or<00:00:20.640> not<00:00:20.699> you<00:00:20.820> can<00:00:20.939> be<00:00:20.970> a<00:00:21.060> good

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
whether or not you can be a good

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.060 
whether or not you can be a good
composer<00:00:21.630> or<00:00:21.869> a<00:00:21.930> good<00:00:22.080> musician<00:00:22.260> that's<00:00:22.800> up<00:00:22.949> to

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
composer or a good musician that's up to

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.029 
composer or a good musician that's up to
you<00:00:23.220> but<00:00:23.460> I<00:00:24.359> think<00:00:24.449> whenever<00:00:24.869> anyone<00:00:25.619> listens

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
you but I think whenever anyone listens

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.589 
you but I think whenever anyone listens
to<00:00:26.369> a<00:00:26.910> pop<00:00:27.300> song<00:00:27.570> and<00:00:27.630> you<00:00:27.990> go<00:00:29.269> yeah<00:00:30.269> I<00:00:30.300> really

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
to a pop song and you go yeah I really

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.269 
to a pop song and you go yeah I really
like<00:00:30.840> this<00:00:31.019> I<00:00:31.170> really<00:00:31.470> like<00:00:31.619> that<00:00:31.800> oh<00:00:32.040> that

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
like this I really like that oh that

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:33.830 
like this I really like that oh that
chorus<00:00:32.610> is<00:00:32.759> too<00:00:32.940> long<00:00:33.120> you<00:00:33.450> know<00:00:33.570> that's

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
chorus is too long you know that's

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.950 
chorus is too long you know that's
composition<00:00:34.520> so<00:00:35.520> when<00:00:36.210> you<00:00:36.329> hear<00:00:36.570> something

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
composition so when you hear something

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.040 
composition so when you hear something
and<00:00:37.110> you<00:00:37.260> evaluate<00:00:37.920> it<00:00:37.950> and<00:00:38.309> you<00:00:38.579> and<00:00:39.510> you

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
and you evaluate it and you and you

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.080 
and you evaluate it and you and you
question<00:00:40.530> it<00:00:40.710> about<00:00:41.399> whether<00:00:41.640> or<00:00:41.820> not<00:00:41.910> it

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
question it about whether or not it

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.979 
question it about whether or not it
works<00:00:42.360> for<00:00:43.020> you<00:00:43.170> that's<00:00:43.410> composition<00:00:44.129> so<00:00:44.989> what

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
works for you that's composition so what

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.139 
works for you that's composition so what
happens<00:00:46.379> is<00:00:46.590> I<00:00:46.739> think<00:00:47.070> we<00:00:47.250> we<00:00:47.820> tell<00:00:48.030> ourselves

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
happens is I think we we tell ourselves

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.189 
happens is I think we we tell ourselves
that<00:00:48.450> only<00:00:48.899> some<00:00:49.200> people<00:00:49.379> can<00:00:49.590> do<00:00:49.980> it<00:00:50.160> and

00:00:51.189 --> 00:00:51.199 
that only some people can do it and

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:53.240 
that only some people can do it and
there<00:00:52.199> are<00:00:52.260> certain<00:00:52.469> things<00:00:52.500> that<00:00:52.739> only<00:00:53.010> some

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
there are certain things that only some

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.040 
there are certain things that only some
people<00:00:53.280> can<00:00:53.550> do<00:00:53.879> there's<00:00:54.090> some<00:00:54.300> experience

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
people can do there's some experience

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.810 
people can do there's some experience
that<00:00:55.110> you<00:00:55.320> need<00:00:55.500> to<00:00:55.620> get<00:00:55.770> in<00:00:55.860> order<00:00:56.010> to<00:00:56.160> be<00:00:56.610> able

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
that you need to get in order to be able

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.819 
that you need to get in order to be able
to<00:00:56.969> do<00:00:57.960> something<00:00:58.350> you<00:00:58.440> know<00:00:58.530> it's<00:00:58.620> like<00:00:58.710> in

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
to do something you know it's like in

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.260 
to do something you know it's like in
order<00:00:59.010> to<00:00:59.100> write<00:00:59.219> for<00:00:59.399> Orchestra<00:00:59.879> you<00:01:00.059> need<00:01:00.239> a

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
order to write for Orchestra you need a

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.939 
order to write for Orchestra you need a
huge<00:01:00.480> amount<00:01:00.750> of<00:01:00.809> sophistication<00:01:01.590> to<00:01:01.710> learn

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
huge amount of sophistication to learn

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.799 
huge amount of sophistication to learn
how<00:01:02.219> the<00:01:02.280> instruments<00:01:02.789> work<00:01:03.000> and<00:01:03.300> how<00:01:03.660> they

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
how the instruments work and how they

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.539 
how the instruments work and how they
balance<00:01:04.260> and<00:01:04.589> you<00:01:04.979> know<00:01:05.100> that<00:01:05.220> just<00:01:05.369> takes

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
balance and you know that just takes

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.679 
balance and you know that just takes
practice<00:01:05.760> but<00:01:06.619> that<00:01:07.619> impulse<00:01:08.100> of<00:01:08.540> being<00:01:09.540> able

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
practice but that impulse of being able

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.859 
practice but that impulse of being able
to<00:01:09.869> judge<00:01:10.380> when<00:01:10.680> music<00:01:11.130> satisfies<00:01:11.760> you<00:01:12.180> that's

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
to judge when music satisfies you that's

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.140 
to judge when music satisfies you that's
the<00:01:13.110> core<00:01:13.350> of<00:01:13.710> composition<00:01:14.520> and<00:01:14.700> that's

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
the core of composition and that's

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.690 
the core of composition and that's
something<00:01:15.479> that<00:01:15.600> I<00:01:15.630> think<00:01:15.840> everybody<00:01:16.200> has<00:01:16.700> the

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
something that I think everybody has the

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.760 
something that I think everybody has the
the<00:01:18.540> break<00:01:18.780> between<00:01:19.020> musicians<00:01:19.650> and

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
the break between musicians and

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.320 
the break between musicians and
composers<00:01:19.890> I<00:01:20.369> think<00:01:20.580> is<00:01:20.670> more<00:01:20.820> interesting

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
composers I think is more interesting

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.609 
composers I think is more interesting
because<00:01:21.479> I<00:01:21.720> think<00:01:21.780> we<00:01:23.900> we<00:01:24.900> like<00:01:25.140> that<00:01:25.350> break

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
because I think we we like that break

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.920 
because I think we we like that break
you<00:01:26.220> know<00:01:26.340> I<00:01:26.369> mean<00:01:26.610> I<00:01:26.670> think<00:01:26.729> we<00:01:27.060> we<00:01:27.479> built<00:01:27.750> that

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
you know I mean I think we we built that

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.140 
you know I mean I think we we built that
break<00:01:28.200> composers<00:01:28.920> built<00:01:29.220> that<00:01:29.430> break<00:01:29.670> because

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
break composers built that break because

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.719 
break composers built that break because
it<00:01:30.750> made<00:01:30.960> us<00:01:31.140> feel<00:01:31.380> like<00:01:31.439> we<00:01:31.710> were<00:01:31.979> special<00:01:32.250> you

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
it made us feel like we were special you

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.600 
it made us feel like we were special you
know<00:01:32.880> like<00:01:33.570> like<00:01:34.500> there's<00:01:34.770> like<00:01:35.549> a

of<00:02:42.330> position<00:02:42.900> so<00:02:43.730> since<00:02:44.730> I've<00:02:45.000> become<00:02:45.360> a

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
from that you know I really think if the

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.729 
from that you know I really think if the
point<00:02:50.910> of<00:02:51.030> music<00:02:51.390> is<00:02:51.540> to<00:02:51.780> communicate<00:02:52.319> if<00:02:52.590> it

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739 
point of music is to communicate if it

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:56.449 
point of music is to communicate if it
is<00:02:52.920> to<00:02:53.220> share<00:02:53.489> something<00:02:54.090> I<00:02:55.129> have<00:02:56.129> to<00:02:56.340> have

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
is to share something I have to have

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:58.430 
is to share something I have to have
something<00:02:56.879> better<00:02:57.030> to<00:02:57.300> share<00:02:57.569> then<00:02:57.959> I<00:02:58.230> know<00:02:58.290> a

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
something better to share then I know a

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.220 
something better to share then I know a
secret<00:02:58.769> and<00:02:59.159> you<00:02:59.340> don't<00:02:59.550> know<00:02:59.790> it<00:03:00.080> you<00:03:01.080> know

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
secret and you don't know it you know

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:02.750 
secret and you don't know it you know
that's<00:03:01.560> not<00:03:01.800> a<00:03:01.830> very<00:03:02.069> good<00:03:02.220> thing<00:03:02.430> to<00:03:02.459> share

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
that's not a very good thing to share

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.380 
that's not a very good thing to share
right<00:03:03.180> you<00:03:03.989> know<00:03:04.140> I<00:03:04.440> think<00:03:05.060> although<00:03:06.060> there's

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
right you know I think although there's

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:08.259 
right you know I think although there's
lots<00:03:06.540> of<00:03:06.659> great<00:03:06.810> music<00:03:07.140> that's<00:03:07.260> made<00:03:07.500> that<00:03:07.709> way

00:03:08.259 --> 00:03:08.269 
lots of great music that's made that way

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:11.390 
lots of great music that's made that way
but<00:03:09.269> for<00:03:09.540> me<00:03:09.810> if<00:03:10.230> the<00:03:10.769> point<00:03:11.040> of<00:03:11.190> it<00:03:11.310> is

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
but for me if the point of it is

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.100 
but for me if the point of it is
communicated<00:03:12.120> to<00:03:12.269> communicate

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110

by making music really hard so so to me
I've<00:05:46.740> I've<00:05:47.099> tried<00:05:47.719> lots<00:05:48.719> of<00:05:48.870> different<00:05:48.930> ways

00:05:49.339 --> 00:05:49.349 
I've I've tried lots of different ways

00:05:49.349 --> 00:05:51.350 
I've I've tried lots of different ways
to<00:05:49.379> make<00:05:49.889> the<00:05:50.099> live<00:05:50.310> experience<00:05:50.580> necessary

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:51.360 
to make the live experience necessary

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:53.540 
to make the live experience necessary
because<00:05:51.750> to<00:05:52.259> me<00:05:52.439> that's<00:05:52.589> my<00:05:52.830> favorite<00:05:53.219> part<00:05:53.430> of

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:53.550 
because to me that's my favorite part of

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:55.249 
because to me that's my favorite part of
the<00:05:53.699> experience<00:05:54.120> is<00:05:54.300> the<00:05:54.360> live<00:05:54.629> concert<00:05:54.930> not

00:05:55.249 --> 00:05:55.259 
the experience is the live concert not

00:05:55.259 --> 00:05:59.649 
the experience is the live concert not
the<00:05:55.500> recorded<00:05:56.399> part<00:05:56.719> Allmusic<00:05:57.889> was<00:05:58.889> new<00:05:59.219> once

00:05:59.649 --> 00:05:59.659 
the recorded part Allmusic was new once

00:05:59.659 --> 00:06:02.899 
the recorded part Allmusic was new once
you<00:06:00.659> know<00:06:00.870> so<00:06:01.710> everything<00:06:02.370> that<00:06:02.490> happened

00:06:02.899 --> 00:06:02.909 
you know so everything that happened

00:06:02.909 --> 00:06:05.899 
you know so everything that happened
happened<00:06:03.509> for<00:06:03.750> the<00:06:03.839> first<00:06:03.870> time<00:06:04.379> sometime<00:06:05.219> so

00:06:05.899 --> 00:06:05.909 
happened for the first time sometime so

00:06:05.909 --> 00:06:08.059 
happened for the first time sometime so
I<00:06:05.939> think<00:06:06.149> the<00:06:06.449> classical<00:06:06.960> music<00:06:07.069> designation

00:06:08.059 --> 00:06:08.069 
I think the classical music designation

00:06:08.069 --> 00:06:11.689 
I think the classical music designation
is<00:06:08.430> a<00:06:08.909> little<00:06:09.300> misleading<00:06:09.539> and<00:06:10.259> it<00:06:11.099> makes<00:06:11.370> us

00:06:11.689 --> 00:06:11.699 
is a little misleading and it makes us

00:06:11.699 --> 00:06:14.929 
is a little misleading and it makes us
kind<00:06:12.360> of<00:06:12.419> build<00:06:12.659> an<00:06:12.839> institution<00:06:13.229> that<00:06:13.939> that

00:06:14.929 --> 00:06:14.939 
kind of build an institution that that

00:06:14.939 --> 00:06:17.149 
kind of build an institution that that
isn't<00:06:15.210> really<00:06:15.449> helpful<00:06:15.839> you<00:06:16.469> know<00:06:16.500> we<00:06:17.039> don't

00:06:17.149 --> 00:06:17.159 
isn't really helpful you know we don't

00:06:17.159 --> 00:06:19.399 
isn't really helpful you know we don't
