was<00:02:51.870> it<00:02:52.020> a<00:02:52.230> good<00:02:53.190> idea<00:02:53.250> on<00:02:53.760> capcom's<00:02:54.270> part<00:02:54.630> to

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
was it a good idea on capcom's part to

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.729 
was it a good idea on capcom's part to
actually<00:02:55.170> remake<00:02:55.590> this<00:02:55.770> for<00:02:56.250> the<00:02:56.400> game<00:02:56.580> gear<00:02:56.880> I

00:02:57.729 --> 00:02:57.739 
actually remake this for the game gear I

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:02.140 
actually remake this for the game gear I
don't<00:02:58.739> know<00:02:58.920> but<00:02:59.280> it's<00:02:59.700> freaking<00:03:00.570> dark

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150 
don't know but it's freaking dark

to<00:04:21.970> white<00:04:22.000> effect<00:04:22.479> I<00:04:25.169> wonder<00:04:26.169> this<00:04:26.320> is

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:26.470 
to white effect I wonder this is

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:32.600 
to white effect I wonder this is
damaging<00:04:26.950> I<00:04:27.690> think<00:04:28.690> it<00:04:28.780> does

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:32.610 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:39.050 

I'm<00:04:33.610> not<00:04:33.790> sure<00:04:34.060> that's<00:04:34.270> totally<00:04:34.840> worth<00:04:35.290> it

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:39.060 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:43.170 

that<00:04:40.060> seems<00:04:40.360> to<00:04:40.510> do<00:04:40.630> quite<00:04:40.660> a<00:04:40.900> bit<00:04:40.960> too<00:04:42.000> or<00:04:43.000> at

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:43.180 
that seems to do quite a bit too or at

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:45.780 
that seems to do quite a bit too or at
least<00:04:43.389> in<00:04:43.570> it<00:04:43.720> a<00:04:43.900> small<00:04:44.860> amount<00:04:45.160> I'm<00:04:45.550> going<00:04:45.730> to

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:45.790 
least in it a small amount I'm going to

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:48.470 
least in it a small amount I'm going to
go<00:04:45.880> ahead<00:04:45.910> and<00:04:46.150> stick<00:04:46.330> to<00:04:46.360> the<00:04:46.540> mustard

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:48.480 
go ahead and stick to the mustard

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:51.690 
go ahead and stick to the mustard
honestly<00:04:49.620> you<00:04:50.620> can<00:04:50.800> just<00:04:50.980> keep<00:04:51.100> shooting<00:04:51.370> him

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:51.700 
honestly you can just keep shooting him

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:55.379 
honestly you can just keep shooting him
and<00:04:51.850> damaging<00:04:52.270> him<00:04:52.389> it<00:04:52.510> looks<00:04:52.720> like<00:04:53.820> and<00:04:54.820> it

00:04:55.379 --> 00:04:55.389 
and damaging him it looks like and it

00:04:55.389 --> 00:04:56.760 
and damaging him it looks like and it
looks<00:04:55.570> like<00:04:55.690> his<00:04:55.810> preferred<00:04:56.169> tactic<00:04:56.620> is<00:04:56.740> to

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:56.770 
looks like his preferred tactic is to

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:59.700 
looks like his preferred tactic is to
the<00:04:57.010> fries<00:04:57.370> and<00:04:57.639> leap<00:04:58.080> so<00:04:59.080> bright<00:04:59.320> man<00:04:59.530> is

00:04:59.700 --> 00:04:59.710 
the fries and leap so bright man is

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:05.270 
the fries and leap so bright man is
still<00:04:59.980> is<00:05:00.130> a<00:05:00.160> little<00:05:00.430> cheap<00:05:00.910> itself<00:05:04.110> that's

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:05.280 
still is a little cheap itself that's

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:12.900 
still is a little cheap itself that's
that's<00:05:06.280> a<00:05:06.430> pleasure<00:05:06.760> to<00:05:07.030> know<00:05:07.060> really<00:05:11.910> try
