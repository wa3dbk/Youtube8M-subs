00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:43.299

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:46.180
 It's been a while since I found one. 

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:46.959
 last I remember what but a meeting that 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.519
 I made 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:50.140
 I had a girl with this book I 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:52.209
 I was very excited and I really wanted to 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:55.299

00:02:55.299 --> 00:03:00.190
 I wanted to buy 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:02.530
 I found it and now I know why I'm 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.090
 reading this one from here but later when I 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:07.870
 start the law I think I'll love it 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:11.319
 It looks very nice, but here's to the king. 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:12.879
 venia is put I think here is a country 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:16.120
 Of the wonders I think they are 

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:19.450
 less over there where they are going coke 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:24.459

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:28.239
 There's Mary and it's written like rock. 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:29.200
 high and it's really cool is this series 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:32.650
 of books 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:34.870
 I love people I think reading a 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:35.590
 very important habit for life 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:37.569
 same 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:39.910
 this helps a lot of new vocabulary 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:42.400
 You learn new words. 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:44.739
 This is great fun too if you 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:49.180
 Do not want to buy a book, can you? 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:50.260
 to do is like a library is to pick up 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:52.780
 borrowed 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:54.849
 You can also create the book club 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:56.980
 between her friends make an exchange of 

00:03:54.849 --> 00:04:00.190
 books and you'll read it later. 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:01.660
 can discuss how the book was and that is 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:04.389
 very cool too 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:07.480
 What I like the most is that you 

00:04:04.389 --> 00:04:10.000
 it 's like it's a movie in your 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:11.769
 Only head are you reading 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.799
 Imagine what you want about it. 

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:18.039
 story you imagine who you want 

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:19.599
 without you seeing the character this is very 

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:21.789
 cool 

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:22.900
