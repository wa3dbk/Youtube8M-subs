00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
running into trouble with these in the

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.080 
running into trouble with these in the
past<00:00:48.660> before<00:00:48.870> because<00:00:49.410> they<00:00:49.590> contain<00:00:50.090> red

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
past before because they contain red

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.069

acid<00:00:51.840> red<00:00:52.289> ATU<00:00:52.920> which<00:00:53.129> is<00:00:53.280> I<00:00:53.399> guess<00:00:53.579> a<00:00:53.850> dye<00:00:54.180> but

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
acid red ATU which is I guess a dye but

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.819 
acid red ATU which is I guess a dye but
now<00:00:55.710> I<00:00:55.739> see<00:00:56.250> they<00:00:56.579> are<00:00:56.610> not<00:00:57.059> as<00:00:57.420> red<00:00:58.050> and<00:00:58.440> then

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
now I see they are not as red and then

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.420 
now I see they are not as red and then
change<00:00:58.859> the<00:00:59.340> packaging<00:00:59.879> to<00:00:59.940> so<00:01:00.660> I<00:01:01.140> guess<00:01:01.859> they

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
change the packaging to so I guess they

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.280 
change the packaging to so I guess they
