 our exhibitors therefore the bulb growers 

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:33.879
 always say it comes with nature 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.860

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.289
 words that have blossomed with this 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:49.359

 waiting young two days really upstairs 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:54.879
 You don't know zero because you just see them 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:56.350
