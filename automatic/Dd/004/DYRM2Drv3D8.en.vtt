thing we left off with his scripts and
storyboards<00:00:12.150> and<00:00:12.240> how<00:00:12.690> it<00:00:12.900> makes<00:00:13.139> it<00:00:13.349> easy

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
storyboards and how it makes it easy

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.490 
storyboards and how it makes it easy
when<00:00:14.009> you<00:00:14.580> have<00:00:14.610> your<00:00:15.030> things<00:00:15.750> scripted<00:00:16.320> and

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
when you have your things scripted and

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.540 
when you have your things scripted and
storyboard<00:00:17.010> it<00:00:17.449> for<00:00:18.449> recording<00:00:18.720> purposes<00:00:19.550> now

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
storyboard it for recording purposes now

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.310 
storyboard it for recording purposes now
now<00:00:21.060> that<00:00:21.119> we're<00:00:21.420> ready<00:00:21.510> to<00:00:21.689> record<00:00:21.990> we<00:00:22.199> have

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
now that we're ready to record we have

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.349 
now that we're ready to record we have
all<00:00:22.529> this<00:00:22.710> knowledge<00:00:22.769> under<00:00:23.400> our<00:00:23.550> belt<00:00:23.789> here's

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
all this knowledge under our belt here's

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.900 
all this knowledge under our belt here's
one<00:00:24.600> thing<00:00:24.810> I<00:00:24.930> want<00:00:25.140> to<00:00:25.170> point<00:00:25.320> out<00:00:25.560> to<00:00:25.769> you<00:00:25.910> in

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
one thing I want to point out to you in

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.470 
one thing I want to point out to you in
camera<00:00:27.869> editing<00:00:28.019> in<00:00:28.470> framing<00:00:29.220> it's<00:00:29.670> very<00:00:30.090> very

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
camera editing in framing it's very very

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.290 
camera editing in framing it's very very
important<00:00:31.019> so<00:00:31.769> for<00:00:32.099> example<00:00:32.160> you<00:00:32.759> see<00:00:33.149> these

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
important so for example you see these

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.500 
important so for example you see these
lights<00:00:33.600> behind<00:00:33.840> me<00:00:34.200> so<00:00:34.920> that<00:00:35.100> we<00:00:35.450> want<00:00:36.450> to

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
lights behind me so that we want to

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.209 
lights behind me so that we want to
demonstrate<00:00:36.660> framing<00:00:37.530> and<00:00:37.680> somewhat

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
demonstrate framing and somewhat

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:39.709 
demonstrate framing and somewhat
basically<00:00:38.640> what<00:00:38.730> we<00:00:38.850> did<00:00:39.000> is<00:00:39.120> we<00:00:39.149> move<00:00:39.510> the

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
basically what we did is we move the

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.350 
basically what we did is we move the
lights<00:00:39.960> in<00:00:40.739> a<00:00:40.920> position<00:00:41.280> that<00:00:41.700> best

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
lights in a position that best

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.660 
lights in a position that best
represents<00:00:43.110> the<00:00:43.230> shop<00:00:43.500> that's<00:00:44.040> really<00:00:44.520> the

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
represents the shop that's really the

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:45.979 
represents the shop that's really the
things<00:00:44.879> you<00:00:45.090> have<00:00:45.239> to<00:00:45.420> take<00:00:45.660> in<00:00:45.840> consideration

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
things you have to take in consideration

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.610 
things you have to take in consideration
when<00:00:46.800> you<00:00:46.890> turn<00:00:47.070> that<00:00:47.250> camera<00:00:47.489> on<00:00:48.140> it<00:00:49.140> you've

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
when you turn that camera on it you've

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.110 
when you turn that camera on it you've
heard<00:00:49.800> it<00:00:49.950> before<00:00:49.980> if<00:00:50.579> there's<00:00:50.820> a<00:00:50.879> pole

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
heard it before if there's a pole

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.510 
heard it before if there's a pole
sticking<00:00:51.329> out<00:00:51.600> of<00:00:51.719> somebody's<00:00:52.079> head<00:00:52.520> move

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
case to give this depth of the shot we

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.340 
case to give this depth of the shot we
moved<00:00:59.370> it<00:00:59.579> and<00:00:59.730> recorded<00:01:00.449> it<00:01:00.600> so<00:01:01.050> the<00:01:01.170> main

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
moved it and recorded it so the main

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.349 
moved it and recorded it so the main

the shot that's why TV and movies look
so<00:01:20.729> great<00:01:21.060> because<00:01:21.299> they<00:01:21.540> take<00:01:21.780> their<00:01:21.990> time

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229

so great because they take their time
and<00:01:22.530> they<00:01:22.920> really<00:01:23.460> really<00:01:23.640> plan<00:01:23.939> out<00:01:23.970> their

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
shots now that you have that information

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.760 
shots now that you have that information
turn<00:01:27.570> the<00:01:27.689> camera<00:01:27.840> on<00:01:28.020> and<00:01:28.229> start<00:01:28.439> recording

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
but before remember one thing look back

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.370 
but before remember one thing look back
at<00:01:31.920> your<00:01:32.040> storyboard<00:01:32.759> because<00:01:33.450> in<00:01:33.750> your

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
at your storyboard because in your

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.679 
at your storyboard because in your
storyboard<00:01:34.740> if<00:01:35.549> you<00:01:35.880> have<00:01:36.060> an<00:01:36.180> establishing

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
storyboard if you have an establishing

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.020 
storyboard if you have an establishing
shot<00:01:36.840> showing<00:01:37.590> for<00:01:38.009> example<00:01:38.460> you're<00:01:38.850> going<00:01:38.970> to

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
shot showing for example you're going to

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.730 
shot showing for example you're going to
show<00:01:39.210> somebody<00:01:39.420> walk<00:01:39.720> into<00:01:40.079> a<00:01:40.110> building<00:01:40.350> and

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
show somebody walk into a building and

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.679 
show somebody walk into a building and
then<00:01:41.130> after<00:01:41.729> they<00:01:41.850> walk<00:01:42.060> into<00:01:42.270> the<00:01:42.420> ability

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
then after they walk into the ability

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.620 
then after they walk into the ability
going<00:01:42.869> to<00:01:42.960> show<00:01:43.110> them<00:01:43.140> go<00:01:43.380> to<00:01:43.439> the<00:01:43.680> front<00:01:43.860> desk

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.630 
going to show them go to the front desk

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.210 
going to show them go to the front desk
keep<00:01:45.630> that<00:01:45.840> in<00:01:45.960> mind<00:01:46.140> and<00:01:46.350> shoot<00:01:46.649> it<00:01:46.770> that<00:01:46.950> way

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
keep that in mind and shoot it that way

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.249 
keep that in mind and shoot it that way
but<00:01:47.850> you<00:01:48.060> can<00:01:48.299> actually<00:01:48.509> shoot<00:01:48.869> it<00:01:49.020> in<00:01:49.110> your

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 
is now walking into the building and

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:04.340 
is now walking into the building and
then<00:02:03.270> when<00:02:03.450> they<00:02:03.540> walk<00:02:03.750> into<00:02:03.930> the<00:02:04.049> building<00:02:04.140> of

then when they walk into the building of

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:05.810 
then when they walk into the building of
the<00:02:04.409> front<00:02:04.649> desk<00:02:04.890> you<00:02:05.130> can<00:02:05.159> turn<00:02:05.399> the<00:02:05.520> camera

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
the front desk you can turn the camera

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.880 
the front desk you can turn the camera
off<00:02:05.880> set<00:02:06.210> up<00:02:06.299> your<00:02:06.420> shot<00:02:06.479> show<00:02:07.229> them<00:02:07.469> entering

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
off set up your shot show them entering

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.609 
off set up your shot show them entering
to<00:02:08.129> that<00:02:08.280> front<00:02:08.550> desk<00:02:08.849> and<00:02:09.179> if<00:02:10.110> you<00:02:10.229> do<00:02:10.410> that

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
to that front desk and if you do that

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.100 
to that front desk and if you do that
based<00:02:11.610> on<00:02:11.849> your<00:02:11.910> storyboard<00:02:12.690> it

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
based on your storyboard it

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.800 
based on your storyboard it
linear<00:02:13.380> fashion<00:02:13.650> it<00:02:14.190> goes<00:02:14.820> on<00:02:14.970> tape<00:02:15.300> that<00:02:15.540> way

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
linear fashion it goes on tape that way

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.690 
linear fashion it goes on tape that way
and<00:02:16.050> guess<00:02:16.380> what<00:02:16.680> when<00:02:17.130> you<00:02:17.220> bring<00:02:17.430> you<00:02:17.550> the

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
and guess what when you bring you the

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.730 
and guess what when you bring you the
computer<00:02:17.820> you<00:02:18.420> have<00:02:18.600> less<00:02:18.900> editing<00:02:19.440> to<00:02:19.590> do

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
computer you have less editing to do

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:22.820 
computer you have less editing to do
it's<00:02:20.370> called<00:02:20.670> in<00:02:20.880> camera<00:02:21.510> editing<00:02:21.830> there's

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
it's called in camera editing there's

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.440 
it's called in camera editing there's
there's<00:02:23.310> a<00:02:23.490> lot<00:02:23.700> of<00:02:23.730> techniques<00:02:24.180> that<00:02:24.270> you<00:02:24.390> can

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
there's a lot of techniques that you can

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.960 
there's a lot of techniques that you can
look<00:02:24.690> up<00:02:24.810> online<00:02:25.050> but<00:02:25.830> keep<00:02:26.070> in<00:02:26.280> mind<00:02:26.310> if<00:02:26.790> you

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
look up online but keep in mind if you

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.020 
look up online but keep in mind if you
plan<00:02:27.300> your<00:02:27.330> shots<00:02:27.840> out<00:02:28.430> when<00:02:29.430> you<00:02:29.520> record<00:02:29.910> them

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
plan your shots out when you record them

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.010 
plan your shots out when you record them
on<00:02:30.210> tape<00:02:30.480> it<00:02:30.750> makes<00:02:31.110> it<00:02:31.260> easier<00:02:31.740> when<00:02:32.070> you<00:02:32.160> edit

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:33.020 
on tape it makes it easier when you edit

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:36.230 
on tape it makes it easier when you edit
basically<00:02:34.020> the<00:02:34.140> recording<00:02:34.590> process<00:02:35.120> when<00:02:36.120> you

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:36.240 
basically the recording process when you

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.650 
basically the recording process when you
get<00:02:36.480> to<00:02:36.660> it<00:02:36.810> is<00:02:37.130> everything<00:02:38.130> is<00:02:38.280> framed

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
get to it is everything is framed

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:41.780 
get to it is everything is framed
everything<00:02:39.660> is<00:02:39.810> lit<00:02:40.110> your<00:02:40.770> sound<00:02:41.190> is<00:02:41.400> checked

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
everything is lit your sound is checked

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.720 
everything is lit your sound is checked
out<00:02:42.000> you've<00:02:42.750> done<00:02:42.930> your<00:02:43.080> sound<00:02:43.380> test

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
out you've done your sound test

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.310 
out you've done your sound test
everything<00:02:44.730> is<00:02:44.820> ready<00:02:45.000> to<00:02:45.180> go<00:02:45.360> your<00:02:45.870> actors

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:46.320 
everything is ready to go your actors

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:50.480 
everything is ready to go your actors
are<00:02:46.500> all<00:02:46.620> in<00:02:46.770> place<00:02:46.800> and<00:02:47.400> you<00:02:48.000> record<00:02:49.280> now<00:02:50.280> that

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:50.490 
are all in place and you record now that

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:52.790 
are all in place and you record now that
you've<00:02:50.640> learned<00:02:50.790> everything<00:02:51.270> about<00:02:51.540> how<00:02:52.050> to

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
you've learned everything about how to

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.970 
you've learned everything about how to
frame<00:02:53.100> compose<00:02:53.940> and<00:02:54.300> record<00:02:54.900> well<00:02:55.709> within

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
frame compose and record well within

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.760 
frame compose and record well within
your<00:02:56.100> camera<00:02:56.670> let's<00:02:57.510> take<00:02:57.690> a<00:02:57.750> look<00:02:58.020> on<00:02:58.200> how<00:02:58.260> to

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:58.770 
your camera let's take a look on how to

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:02.450 
your camera let's take a look on how to
bring<00:02:59.040> all<00:02:59.190> that<00:02:59.340> stuff<00:02:59.580> into<00:02:59.850> your<00:02:59.970> computer
