00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
what to say really put a snazz in it was

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.660 
what to say really put a snazz in it was
the<00:02:26.150> WWE<00:02:26.660> was<00:02:26.959> not<00:02:27.200> expecting<00:02:27.800> edge<00:02:27.980> to<00:02:28.250> retire

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
the WWE was not expecting edge to retire

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:30.820 
the WWE was not expecting edge to retire
I'm<00:02:29.390> pretty<00:02:29.599> sure<00:02:29.750> the<00:02:29.840> original<00:02:30.290> plan<00:02:30.500> wasn't

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830 
I'm pretty sure the original plan wasn't

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:33.370 
I'm pretty sure the original plan wasn't
to<00:02:30.980> have<00:02:31.190> him<00:02:31.550> drop<00:02:31.880> it<00:02:31.940> after<00:02:32.180> two<00:02:32.450> days<00:02:32.630> the

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.380 
to have him drop it after two days the

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:36.400 
to have him drop it after two days the
original<00:02:33.830> plan<00:02:34.040> was<00:02:34.280> for<00:02:34.489> edge<00:02:35.019> to<00:02:36.019> loser<00:02:36.230> to

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410 
original plan was for edge to loser to

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:39.100 
original plan was for edge to loser to
Alberto<00:02:36.830> Del<00:02:37.010> Rio<00:02:37.220> at<00:02:37.640> Extreme<00:02:38.540> Rules<00:02:38.569> and

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
Alberto Del Rio at Extreme Rules and

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:41.470 
Alberto Del Rio at Extreme Rules and
then<00:02:39.709> for<00:02:39.860> Randy<00:02:40.190> Orton<00:02:40.220> to<00:02:40.580> pick<00:02:40.730> it<00:02:40.849> up<00:02:40.940> the

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
then for Randy Orton to pick it up the

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.650 
then for Randy Orton to pick it up the
next<00:02:41.510> two<00:02:42.019> days<00:02:42.700> that's<00:02:43.700> what<00:02:43.910> I<00:02:43.940> think<00:02:44.209> the

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
next two days that's what I think the

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:46.300 
next two days that's what I think the
WWE<00:02:45.170> originally<00:02:45.560> had<00:02:45.769> planned<00:02:46.040> both

Christian you know they had to replace
them<00:02:48.830> because<00:02:49.099> edge<00:02:49.250> is<00:02:49.400> gone<00:02:49.510> so<00:02:50.510> how<00:02:50.569> this
