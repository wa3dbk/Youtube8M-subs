this<00:01:32.479> thing<00:01:32.690> would<00:01:32.810> be<00:01:32.929> pretty<00:01:33.140> awful<00:01:33.500> to<00:01:33.560> use

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:33.770 
this thing would be pretty awful to use

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.610 
just wrong this is for Windows so I'm

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:02.949

the<00:02:12.200> exact<00:02:12.440> same<00:02:12.470> one<00:02:12.680> which<00:02:13.400> Banpresto<00:02:14.000> likes

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
the exact same one which Banpresto likes

the exact same one which Banpresto likes
to<00:02:14.330> do<00:02:14.450> and<00:02:14.660> then<00:02:15.260> a<00:02:15.709> Starman<00:02:16.129> which<00:02:17.560> may<00:02:18.560> be

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
to do and then a Starman which may be

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:23.540 
to do and then a Starman which may be
even<00:02:18.890> worse<00:02:18.920> of<00:02:19.280> an<00:02:19.370> idea<00:02:20.440> for<00:02:21.440> a<00:02:21.920> mouse
