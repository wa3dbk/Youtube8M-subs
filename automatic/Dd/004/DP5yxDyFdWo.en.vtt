00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.560
 I start as you saw it 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.620
 my son saw the bench then at 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:16.320
 forum so I ask who it was in 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.150
 forum as you saw I told myself that 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.590
 it was a nice game 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.960
 fun usually they show up 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.150
 leave in what is bored instead it is 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.300
 been alive for all 90 minutes 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.099
 we are good at dribbling especially in the 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.500
 first sixty minutes a little down 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.120
 in the finale where the came out 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.910
 freshness and many interesting young people 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.149
 which has the pescara 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:41.129
 we were little Chinese maybe during 

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:42.690
 the race, however, happy with this race e 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.920
 I say about the boys' approach for us 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.910
 the first real game we play 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:50.570
 satisfied with the movements of what 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:55.879
 they searched from beginning to end 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:58.530
 which is a large group that tries 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:00:59.129
 look hard for what we feel in 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.770
 work out 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:06.140
 sometimes succeeding sometimes not but 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:08.670
 however always trying both from 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:11.640
 from having the courage to play the ball 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:15.509
 from behind that being short from trying 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:19.189
 certain played forward 34 times 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:19.189
 we also managed quite well 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:26.070
 and I'm but I'm very happy because 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:28.920
 at least on the quay I saw great 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:32.670
 spirit certainly but also good ones 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:36.300
 you also play a lot of mistakes though 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:38.100
 I think they are errors due more maybe 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.600
 lack of strength in the legs 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.760
 we haven't got two right now 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.990
 goal that a man with his back turned towards 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:45.540
 the door 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.190
 if maybe they were attacked 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.290
 to the man to interview a meter maybe 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:53.250
 there was no cleat and no one 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:55.770
 entered the area second circumstance yes 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.780
 avoided a player passing in 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.510
 half to two so that worries me 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.070
 a little less genuinely not in general 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:05.070
 I liked the team I didn't know 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:07.410
 the one who came in has me cheating 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.970
 everyone came in i saw nov beyond 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:11.580
 of the technical qualities that can have then 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.680
 an annoying player in series b I have it 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.300
 seen bad in this league a 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.520
 championship of b determined players 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:20.670
 they can make a difference if it keeps 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:22.050
 this way of playing of mentality 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.360
 when the shooter enters the field 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:25.650
 can do well in presenting trita 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.540
 I confirm what I said that is a 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.750
 great talent what great qualities it is 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:34.380
 an excellent ball control but that 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:36.630
 must learn to move without the ball 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:38.640
 move for the companion to open it 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:42.750
 space for mates 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:46.310
 don't just play with your back to the door not 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.310
 always receive the ball on your feet 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:53.010
 and as I said before with intent 

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:55.379
 also to open spaces for comrades 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:58.019
 in short, doing is our player 

00:02:55.379 --> 00:03:00.330
 in the sense that I think it is a 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:04.049
 player also ready for the series a 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:05.489
 but I'm evaluating it I'm doing it 

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:08.040
 play in these games because me 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:09.599
 I really want to keep it in 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.819
 great in great consideration 

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:13.500
 we took def rel but he is a 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:16.829
 Property young player who is 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:19.170
 also as a company we intend to evaluate 

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:21.620
 from which until the end of August which 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:24.060
 She will tell her her future 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:29.340
 then I very honestly believe that 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:31.290
 we have a great base to which it goes 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:35.310
 add to this evening have them in three 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:42.269
 certainly sciences of ours and therefore 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:45.540
 they are two excellent purchases and I believe that there 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:49.120
 whether there is a need for an attacker with 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:51.680
 different features and maybe 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:53.600
 winger more but this 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:54.970
 to really make the jump 

00:03:53.600 --> 00:04:01.880
 quality 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:04:04.280
 I believe that in 4 3 1 2 externals I have 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:08.110
 and a few left-handed est ce exteriors 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:10.580
 you play weird or it's right now 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:12.350
 maybe I find it a little hard to find 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:14.570
 especially in outdoor games that 

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:16.900
 right tv games you can adapt for 

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:16.900
 charity 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:22.860
 but surely the Neapolitan left-handed 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:25.590
 that we had last year is not there e 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:28.580
 so then you have trouble maybe a 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:28.580
 find other solutions 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:35.250
 yes certainly not for sure 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:37.050
 surely it would be convenient because how 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:40.020
 not tonight when we fell a 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:41.699
 so many times midfield to three 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:43.410
 then suffer a little on the bands 

00:04:41.699 --> 00:04:45.570
 especially a technical school that knows 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:48.810
 turn the game and maybe cover a little 

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:50.820
 midfield and needs put you at 4 

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:51.990
 maybe you don't have the player he has 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:55.350
 those features 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:56.790
 sure you can even put goats in 

00:04:55.350 --> 00:05:01.830
 right use right however 

00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:06.139
 obviously it's not the same thing when 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:08.100
 when when a company calls you 

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:10.860
 I hardly ask you for a goal well 

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:13.110
 precise because you are not six thousand 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:14.400
 the interest that the 100 million euros a 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:17.110
 arrangement then appears four 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:20.810
 players phenomena 

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:23.170
 I believe that the objectives of the 

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:26.240
 team can do them maybe 

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:28.160
 the coach at the end of the market when he is 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:29.480
 see what kind of players they are 

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:32.750
 arrived based on the requests he has 

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:34.250
 done because if it was enough ask for this 

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:36.200
 this and this comes this e 

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:37.910
 this would be too easy but many 

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:39.440
 sometimes there are other companies that 

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:41.650
 the players who don't are not added up 

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:43.090
 they want to come 

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:44.139
 there are players who want to go 

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:46.030
 so maybe in other schools it is 

00:05:44.139 --> 00:05:47.740
 really a market so hard you and 

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:49.240
 you are the juventus 

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:51.280
 you want a player comes because you are the 

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:53.710
 juventus then pescara and more than movies 

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:58.000
 as another series company b then a 

00:05:53.710 --> 00:06:00.850
 end of the market we could define 

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.669
 a goal that we can things I already 

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:05.289
 believe right now we can 

00:06:02.669 --> 00:06:05.889
 we can fight to get into 

00:06:05.289 --> 00:06:07.570
 first eight 

00:06:05.889 --> 00:06:09.070
 then second of what happens if 

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:10.060
 we will be more confident that 

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:13.120
 we come first with this team 

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:15.970
 we must be very good or maybe 

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:18.600
 someone will be able to get us to do 

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:18.600
 the leap in quality 

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:26.979
 if someone arrives , we have got it 

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:29.530
 already made three games we went into 

00:06:26.979 --> 00:06:32.430
 growing up making an interregional one 

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:34.660
 c1 and a series therefore surely 

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:36.280
 it grows obvious that it is inevitable not 

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:39.130
 we could never be one hundred percent 

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:41.440
 however we say that we certainly have 

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:44.370
 we are only exceeding 50 percent 

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:46.530
 of the condition even more 

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:49.590
 and therefore it will definitely be a match 

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:52.680
 difficult because all the matches of 

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:56.040
 Italian cup are are not difficult 

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:58.850
 we discover nothing so for now we are 

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:58.850
 sure you do well
