00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:05.860
 very good all kid artist monkey hate 

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:08.250
 you wonder what I bring you after 

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:08.250
 so long 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:15.000
 an economic resource for those 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.240
 people who do not want to spend so much 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.480
 money in 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:24.000
 in a contrite place 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:28.320
 It is preferable to buy what I have done 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:34.430
 is to spend three euros with this cable in 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:34.430
 this component but and 55 euros 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:41.420
 night they were 4 sorry and this 5 in total 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:43.910
 nine euros is a bit of both and I 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:47.180
 I bought it in the middle of the sea the only thing 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:50.820
 what you have to do is connect by 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:54.510
 this side this cable 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:58.380
 as well as I could show food 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:00.930
 how am I going here and now here you have to 

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:05.000
 connect the components of the play of 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:08.990
 your play or your team 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:13.350
 red and white yellow watches TV and 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:17.970
 what may be connected is to catch 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:21.360
 the jack component and connect it in 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:24.330
 Any case I prefer this I have 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:27.479
 chosen the toque co trust that will cost me 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:30.210
 a 26 euros us nothing more quality 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:33.370
 precisely and 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.920
 connect it to you as you see we would have already 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:40.240
 finished the assembly process is very 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:44.620
 basic truth and we could already hear the 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:46.810
 game placed with the only bad thing is that 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:50.440
 we could only hear it with the 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:52.930
 microphone we could not talk since the 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:55.510
 another peg since it's there now 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:58.920
 we could not talk and that's 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:02:01.810
 the only bad thing but if it has served you 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:05.100
 help to like and see you in the 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.100
 next video until next time
