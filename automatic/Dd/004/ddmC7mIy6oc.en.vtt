00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 a score as it's a party lurking 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.879
 in the mountains his prey is 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.259
 usual skiers or snowboarders 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:09.840
 regard and how he got there 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.910
 very good question the answer lies 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.950
 in a galaxy very far away very 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.549
 distant distant galaxy very 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.160
 distant 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.080
 you're serious if ever in its history 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:24.449
 there is a little robot that makes debate all 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:26.369
 the time I ask you to michael ealy to 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.720
 millions of years a planet of 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.179
 smart sharks was fighting for the 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.300
 survival of his species their planet was going 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.300
 die 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:37.280
 desperate they have come up with a plan 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:38.960
 very clever since nothing could 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.850
 save their original world they 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.410
 decided to send in the cosmos in 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:43.969
 whole swaths of their specimens 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:45.469
 all this in order to find a 

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:47.899
 planet conducive to receiving their species 

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:49.159
 and preserve their gene pool the 

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:50.570
 benches were made up of millions 

00:00:49.159 --> 00:00:53.239
 of individuals supposed to represent them 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:57.100
 it was not pride it was in 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:57.100
 the hope of perpetuating their race 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:04.780
 Sharks bench to winter 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:06.220
 space for an eternity at the 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:08.110
 search for atmospheric conditions 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:10.380
 adequate to start over again 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:10.380
 elsewhere 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:16.950
 during this trip to their cell 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.580
 energy prices have weakened and 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.580
 survived 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:29.750
 out of the millions that went through 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:31.520
 space one of the rare that a survivor 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.320
 finds the earth on its trajectory 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.000
 he had only one left 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.830
 auxiliary thruster this is what 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.030
 prevented a traveler from adjusting his 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:42.020
 trajectory in the Earth's atmosphere 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:45.830
 is to dive into the Pacific Ocean and 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:47.930
 crashed here of teachers 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:49.430
 its genetic capital has been damaged 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:51.740
 during the crash so instead of attending 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:55.880
 to the creation of a smart shark on 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:02:00.110
 saw emerge a sco monster as was 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:02.980
 born the space of the sharks mountains I 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:02.980
 go to bed thank you
