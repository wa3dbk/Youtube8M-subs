00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.030 
of cars and that's what happened to him
the<00:01:48.570> guy<00:01:48.690> just<00:01:48.990> tried<00:01:49.200> to<00:01:49.320> cut<00:01:49.620> the<00:01:49.650> line<00:01:50.010> and

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
the guy just tried to cut the line and

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.310 
the guy just tried to cut the line and
stopped<00:01:50.670> and<00:01:51.030> he<00:01:51.330> didn't<00:01:51.570> have<00:01:51.750> time<00:01:51.930> to<00:01:51.990> stop

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
stopped and he didn't have time to stop

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.770 
stopped and he didn't have time to stop
so<00:01:52.590> either<00:01:53.160> crash<00:01:53.520> into<00:01:53.820> the<00:01:53.910> back<00:01:54.300> of<00:01:54.330> the<00:01:54.570> car

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
so either crash into the back of the car

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:00.719 
so either crash into the back of the car
or<00:01:54.990> fall<00:01:55.350> and<00:01:55.650> he<00:01:55.830> chose<00:01:56.160> fall

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:00.729 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:05.280 

so<00:02:01.729> he<00:02:01.970> had<00:02:02.210> a<00:02:02.240> problem<00:02:02.869> there<00:02:03.380> so<00:02:03.590> he<00:02:04.250> crashed

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:05.290 
so he had a problem there so he crashed

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:08.109 
so he had a problem there so he crashed
the<00:02:06.290> other<00:02:06.439> two<00:02:06.770> stopped<00:02:07.250> cars<00:02:07.520> had<00:02:07.759> nothing

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
the other two stopped cars had nothing

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:09.370 
the other two stopped cars had nothing
to<00:02:08.239> do<00:02:08.330> with<00:02:08.360> them<00:02:08.599> at<00:02:08.720> least<00:02:08.869> he<00:02:09.080> thinks<00:02:09.229> so

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:09.380 
to do with them at least he thinks so

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:11.860 
to do with them at least he thinks so
when<00:02:10.069> he<00:02:10.220> got<00:02:10.399> up<00:02:10.520> he<00:02:10.700> saw<00:02:10.849> them<00:02:11.030> bumping<00:02:11.750> each

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
when he got up he saw them bumping each

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:14.229 
when he got up he saw them bumping each
other<00:02:12.110> so<00:02:12.920> maybe<00:02:13.160> they<00:02:13.340> got<00:02:13.459> distracted<00:02:13.880> from

leaver it was so bent that the gear the
gear<00:03:24.530> leaver<00:03:24.709> on<00:03:25.040> this<00:03:25.489> particular<00:03:25.910> bike<00:03:26.060> goes

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:26.420 
gear leaver on this particular bike goes

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:27.849 
gear leaver on this particular bike goes
straight<00:03:27.109> over

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:27.859 
straight over

00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:30.819 
straight over
that's<00:03:28.549> rods<00:03:29.420> that<00:03:29.720> then<00:03:29.930> connects<00:03:30.380> into<00:03:30.650> the

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:30.829 
that's rods that then connects into the

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:33.430 
that's rods that then connects into the
gear<00:03:31.549> box<00:03:31.670> so<00:03:32.420> the<00:03:32.600> brake<00:03:32.870> lever<00:03:33.109> goes<00:03:33.290> like

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:33.440 
gear box so the brake lever goes like

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.880 
gear box so the brake lever goes like
this

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:33.890 
this

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:36.150 
this
and<00:03:34.220> then<00:03:34.430> into<00:03:34.850> the<00:03:35.030> linkage<00:03:35.780> and<00:03:36.019> then

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:36.160 
and then into the linkage and then

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:40.180 
and then into the linkage and then
there's<00:03:37.160> the<00:03:37.340> that<00:03:37.700> long<00:03:38.030> rod<00:03:38.480> linkage<00:03:39.190> thingy

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.190 
there's the that long rod linkage thingy

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:43.059 
there's the that long rod linkage thingy
under<00:03:40.730> it<00:03:40.880> so<00:03:41.569> to<00:03:41.780> spend<00:03:41.989> so<00:03:42.230> far<00:03:42.500> into<00:03:42.950> the

00:03:43.059 --> 00:03:43.069 
under it so to spend so far into the

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:45.039 
under it so to spend so far into the
bike<00:03:43.220> that<00:03:43.519> it<00:03:43.790> was<00:03:44.150> hitting<00:03:44.480> the<00:03:44.600> rod<00:03:44.750> so<00:03:44.930> he

00:03:45.039 --> 00:03:45.049 
bike that it was hitting the rod so he

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:48.210 
bike that it was hitting the rod so he
couldn't<00:03:45.290> shift<00:03:45.850> so<00:03:46.850> what<00:03:46.970> I<00:03:47.060> did<00:03:47.120> was<00:03:47.450> get<00:03:47.750> my

as a lever to bent it slightly back into

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:04.710 
as a lever to bent it slightly back into
shape<00:04:02.870> so<00:04:02.930> it<00:04:03.170> would

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:04.720 
shape so it would

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:07.440 
shape so it would
Cass<00:04:05.290> so<00:04:05.590> he<00:04:05.710> could<00:04:05.890> shift<00:04:06.100> again<00:04:06.400> and<00:04:06.580> so<00:04:07.000> I<00:04:07.030> am
