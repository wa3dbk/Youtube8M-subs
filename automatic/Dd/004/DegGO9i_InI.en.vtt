rechargeable battery pack this is that

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:08.509 
rechargeable battery pack this is that
for<00:03:06.269> the<00:03:06.299> controller<00:03:06.750> batteries<00:03:07.709> obviously

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:08.519 
for the controller batteries obviously

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:10.250 
for the controller batteries obviously
the<00:03:09.030> one<00:03:09.180> thing<00:03:09.329> that's<00:03:09.420> not<00:03:09.599> in<00:03:09.810> here<00:03:10.019> is<00:03:10.049> the

the one thing that's not in here is the
AC<00:03:10.439> adapter<00:03:10.739> I<00:03:11.159> already<00:03:11.370> have<00:03:11.609> that<00:03:11.760> because<00:03:12.030> i

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
AC adapter I already have that because i

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.149 
AC adapter I already have that because i
had<00:03:12.480> plug<00:03:12.719> this<00:03:12.870> in<00:03:13.049> before<00:03:13.170> but<00:03:13.950> it's<00:03:14.040> your

00:03:14.149 --> 00:03:14.159 
had plug this in before but it's your

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:19.160 
had plug this in before but it's your
standard<00:03:14.569> AC<00:03:15.569> adapter<00:03:16.290> for<00:03:16.980> this<00:03:17.930> which<00:03:18.930> plugs

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
standard AC adapter for this which plugs

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:23.119 
standard AC adapter for this which plugs
into<00:03:19.290> the<00:03:19.439> back<00:03:19.530> and<00:03:19.950> then<00:03:21.709> it's<00:03:22.709> pretty<00:03:22.950> good

00:03:23.119 --> 00:03:23.129 
into the back and then it's pretty good

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:26.839 
into the back and then it's pretty good
it<00:03:23.280> actually<00:03:23.579> already<00:03:23.970> comes<00:03:24.420> with<00:03:24.560> an<00:03:25.849> hdmi

00:03:26.839 --> 00:03:26.849

00:03:29.809 --> 00:03:29.819 
cable which for some reason this is the

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:32.420 
cable which for some reason this is the
only<00:03:29.939> hdmi<00:03:30.450> cable<00:03:30.870> i<00:03:30.959> got<00:03:31.139> it<00:03:31.260> to<00:03:31.379> work<00:03:31.650> with<00:03:32.010> my

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
only hdmi cable i got it to work with my

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.819 
only hdmi cable i got it to work with my

hdmi cable so i'm gonna have to see
what's<00:03:43.169> up<00:03:43.349> at<00:03:43.530> that<00:03:44.900> the<00:03:45.900> USB<00:03:46.470> cable<00:03:46.500> for<00:03:47.220> oh

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:47.519 
what's up at that the USB cable for oh

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:50.110 
what's up at that the USB cable for oh
you<00:03:48.299> must<00:03:48.450> be<00:03:48.510> cable<00:03:48.840> for<00:03:48.959> the<00:03:48.989> controller

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:50.120 
you must be cable for the controller

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:54.069 
you must be cable for the controller
which<00:03:51.120> this<00:03:51.269> is<00:03:51.450> smaller<00:03:51.900> than<00:03:52.169> your<00:03:52.379> standard
