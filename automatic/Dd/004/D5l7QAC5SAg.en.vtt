00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:23.450 
either principle the only factor is that
the<00:06:14.410> the<00:06:14.710> sequencer<00:06:15.310> only<00:06:16.090> has<00:06:18.150> one<00:06:19.229> 16<00:06:20.580> part

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:23.460 
the the sequencer only has one 16 part

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:26.159 
the the sequencer only has one 16 part
sequencer<00:06:24.460> you<00:06:24.639> can<00:06:24.849> arrange<00:06:25.419> a<00:06:25.720> lots<00:06:25.990> of

00:06:26.159 --> 00:06:26.169 
sequencer you can arrange a lots of

00:06:26.169 --> 00:06:30.300 
sequencer you can arrange a lots of
little<00:06:26.560> sequences<00:06:27.330> but<00:06:28.330> all<00:06:28.599> are<00:06:29.080> based<00:06:29.349> on<00:06:29.710> 16

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:30.310 
little sequences but all are based on 16

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:34.290 
little sequences but all are based on 16
step<00:06:31.650> so<00:06:32.650> it's<00:06:32.830> quite<00:06:33.190> limited<00:06:33.820> during<00:06:34.030> that

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:34.300 
step so it's quite limited during that

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:35.279 
step so it's quite limited during that
respect

00:06:35.279 --> 00:06:35.289 
respect

00:06:35.289 --> 00:06:39.960 
respect
that's<00:06:36.660> for<00:06:37.660> everything<00:06:38.380> else<00:06:38.620> it's<00:06:39.220> rather

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:39.970 
that's for everything else it's rather

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:42.110 
that's for everything else it's rather
good

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:42.120 
good

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:46.320 
good
it<00:06:43.120> ain't<00:06:43.449> slacks<00:06:44.199> on<00:06:44.470> the<00:06:44.620> effects<00:06:45.160> part<00:06:45.610> -<00:06:46.060> it

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:46.330 
it ain't slacks on the effects part - it

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:52.050 
it ain't slacks on the effects part - it
only<00:06:46.630> has<00:06:46.960> delay<00:06:49.919> it's<00:06:50.919> not<00:06:51.220> a<00:06:51.250> complete<00:06:51.789> guru

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:52.060 
only has delay it's not a complete guru

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:56.720 
only has delay it's not a complete guru
box<00:06:52.389> but<00:06:53.110> I<00:06:53.470> can<00:06:53.889> only<00:06:54.130> expect<00:06:54.669> him<00:06:55.000> that

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:56.730 
box but I can only expect him that

00:06:56.730 --> 00:06:59.520 
box but I can only expect him that
that<00:06:57.730> the<00:06:57.850> creators<00:06:58.360> will<00:06:58.630> have<00:06:58.870> some<00:06:59.290> more

00:06:59.520 --> 00:06:59.530 
that the creators will have some more

00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:02.879 
that the creators will have some more
effective<00:07:00.070> after<00:07:00.310> hire<00:07:01.020> because<00:07:02.020> the<00:07:02.530> program

00:07:02.879 --> 00:07:02.889 
effective after hire because the program

00:07:02.889 --> 00:07:06.930 
effective after hire because the program
is<00:07:02.980> is<00:07:03.460> already<00:07:04.030> pretty<00:07:04.750> good<00:07:05.070> just<00:07:06.070> like<00:07:06.610> it

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:06.940 
is is already pretty good just like it

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:08.360 
is is already pretty good just like it
is<00:07:07.150> right<00:07:07.180> now

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:08.370 
is right now

00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:13.650 
is right now
and<00:07:09.570> finally<00:07:10.570> here<00:07:11.260> is<00:07:11.520> six<00:07:12.520> strings<00:07:12.910> six

00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:13.660 
and finally here is six strings six

00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:17.940 
and finally here is six strings six
strings<00:07:14.020> is<00:07:14.260> angular<00:07:14.970> and<00:07:15.970> the<00:07:16.780> the<00:07:17.560> fun<00:07:17.740> thing

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:17.950 
strings is angular and the the fun thing

00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:19.770 
strings is angular and the the fun thing
is<00:07:18.100> that<00:07:18.130> you<00:07:18.490> can<00:07:18.700> pre-program<00:07:19.150> the<00:07:19.510> shores

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:19.780 
is that you can pre-program the shores

00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:23.070 
is that you can pre-program the shores
beforehand<00:07:20.530> I<00:07:20.770> can't<00:07:21.430> really<00:07:21.669> pro<00:07:22.000> play<00:07:22.750> a

00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:23.080 
beforehand I can't really pro play a

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:27.750 
beforehand I can't really pro play a
real<00:07:23.320> guitar<00:07:24.330> but<00:07:25.650> six<00:07:26.650> strings<00:07:27.040> make<00:07:27.340> it<00:07:27.580> easy

00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:27.760 
real guitar but six strings make it easy

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:32.580 
real guitar but six strings make it easy
for<00:07:27.940> you

00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:32.590 

00:07:32.590 --> 00:07:37.110 

but<00:07:33.270> and<00:07:34.270> so<00:07:34.570> I<00:07:34.900> will<00:07:35.800> post<00:07:36.250> another<00:07:36.580> balloon

00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:37.120 
but and so I will post another balloon

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:39.990 
but and so I will post another balloon
full<00:07:37.480> of<00:07:37.630> weeds
