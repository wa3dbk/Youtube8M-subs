00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:02.810 

in<00:00:01.620> this<00:00:01.829> video<00:00:02.040> I'm<00:00:02.280> just<00:00:02.310> going<00:00:02.520> to<00:00:02.580> show<00:00:02.730> you

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:02.820 
in this video I'm just going to show you

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:04.610 
in this video I'm just going to show you
some<00:00:03.030> comparisons<00:00:03.210> between<00:00:03.840> blender<00:00:04.470> render

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:04.620 
some comparisons between blender render

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.179 
some comparisons between blender render
and<00:00:05.009> cycles<00:00:05.700> render<00:00:05.879> and<00:00:06.240> how<00:00:06.420> I<00:00:06.450> use<00:00:06.750> the<00:00:06.990> two

00:00:07.179 --> 00:00:07.189 
and cycles render and how I use the two

00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:09.110 
and cycles render and how I use the two
depending<00:00:08.189> on<00:00:08.309> what<00:00:08.550> projects<00:00:08.970> I'm<00:00:09.090> working

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
depending on what projects I'm working

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.110 
depending on what projects I'm working
on<00:00:09.540> so<00:00:10.139> this<00:00:10.349> project<00:00:10.620> right<00:00:11.010> now<00:00:11.040> is<00:00:11.190> for<00:00:11.759> one

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
on so this project right now is for one

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:13.910 
on so this project right now is for one
of<00:00:12.660> the<00:00:12.719> stories<00:00:13.080> that<00:00:13.110> I'll<00:00:13.290> post<00:00:13.440> later<00:00:13.740> this

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
of the stories that I'll post later this

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.560 
of the stories that I'll post later this
week<00:00:14.160> on<00:00:14.309> my<00:00:14.429> sci-fi<00:00:14.639> animated<00:00:15.240> website

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
week on my sci-fi animated website

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.300 
week on my sci-fi animated website
called<00:00:15.839> which<00:00:16.020> hex<00:00:16.260> -<00:00:16.529> it's<00:00:16.770> teaches

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
called which hex - it's teaches

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.189 
called which hex - it's teaches
hexadecimal<00:00:17.970> numbers<00:00:18.240> to<00:00:18.480> kids<00:00:18.690> and<00:00:18.869> adults

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
hexadecimal numbers to kids and adults

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.519 
hexadecimal numbers to kids and adults
and<00:00:20.180> so<00:00:21.180> that's<00:00:21.660> this<00:00:21.960> is<00:00:22.080> the<00:00:22.199> rendered

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
and so that's this is the rendered

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:23.540 
and so that's this is the rendered
version<00:00:22.680> well<00:00:23.039> the<00:00:23.130> nice<00:00:23.279> thing<00:00:23.519> about

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
version well the nice thing about

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.939 
version well the nice thing about
blender<00:00:24.180> these<00:00:24.330> days<00:00:24.570> and<00:00:24.840> with<00:00:24.960> the<00:00:25.050> GPUs<00:00:25.619> is

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
blender these days and with the GPUs is

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.230 
blender these days and with the GPUs is
that<00:00:26.160> let's<00:00:26.699> take<00:00:26.849> a<00:00:26.880> look

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
that let's take a look

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.880 
that let's take a look
typically<00:00:27.630> in<00:00:27.750> the<00:00:27.840> old<00:00:27.990> days<00:00:28.199> when<00:00:28.529> I<00:00:28.560> built

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
typically in the old days when I built

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.279 
typically in the old days when I built
this<00:00:29.039> scene<00:00:29.340> initially<00:00:29.609> a<00:00:29.849> long<00:00:30.000> time<00:00:30.269> ago<00:00:30.570> it

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
this scene initially a long time ago it

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.380 
this scene initially a long time ago it
was<00:00:31.439> really<00:00:32.219> slow<00:00:32.520> even<00:00:32.820> just<00:00:32.969> to<00:00:33.059> render<00:00:33.360> a

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
was really slow even just to render a

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.049 
was really slow even just to render a
single<00:00:33.660> frame<00:00:33.840> was<00:00:34.260> quite<00:00:34.920> slow<00:00:35.250> so<00:00:35.520> I'm

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
single frame was quite slow so I'm

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:37.610 
single frame was quite slow so I'm
working<00:00:36.270> in<00:00:36.510> blender<00:00:36.660> render<00:00:36.899> as<00:00:37.260> you<00:00:37.410> see

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
working in blender render as you see

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.940 
working in blender render as you see
here<00:00:38.070> if<00:00:38.550> I<00:00:38.700> weren't<00:00:38.879> I'm<00:00:39.120> not<00:00:39.480> in<00:00:39.950> texture

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
here if I weren't I'm not in texture

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.470 
here if I weren't I'm not in texture
mode<00:00:41.160> let's<00:00:41.340> go<00:00:41.430> into<00:00:41.610> texture<00:00:41.910> mode<00:00:42.030> just<00:00:42.270> for

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
mode let's go into texture mode just for

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.840 
mode let's go into texture mode just for
a<00:00:42.510> second<00:00:42.899> and<00:00:43.140> that's<00:00:43.410> okay<00:00:43.860> but<00:00:44.190> that<00:00:44.700> never

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
a second and that's okay but that never

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.310 
a second and that's okay but that never
really<00:00:45.030> gives<00:00:45.300> me<00:00:45.480> an<00:00:45.539> idea<00:00:45.870> of<00:00:45.960> what<00:00:46.200> the

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
really gives me an idea of what the

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.680 
really gives me an idea of what the
scene<00:00:46.640> you<00:00:47.640> know<00:00:47.730> looks<00:00:48.000> like<00:00:48.090> unless<00:00:48.450> I

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
scene you know looks like unless I

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.840 
scene you know looks like unless I
actually<00:00:49.559> do<00:00:49.920> the<00:00:50.039> rendering<00:00:50.250> order<00:00:50.670> like

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
actually do the rendering order like

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.240 
actually do the rendering order like
this<00:00:51.120> well<00:00:52.050> this<00:00:52.140> is<00:00:52.199> the<00:00:52.379> kind<00:00:52.559> of<00:00:52.620> style<00:00:52.890> of

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
this well this is the kind of style of

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.490 
this well this is the kind of style of
rendering<00:00:53.760> I<00:00:53.820> like<00:00:54.000> to<00:00:54.149> do<00:00:54.270> for<00:00:54.570> the<00:00:55.289> kids

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
rendering I like to do for the kids

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.770 
rendering I like to do for the kids
books<00:00:55.829> because<00:00:56.309> it's<00:00:56.520> you<00:00:57.149> know<00:00:57.210> it's<00:00:57.390> I<00:00:57.629> don't

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
books because it's you know it's I don't

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.930 
books because it's you know it's I don't
want<00:00:57.989> to<00:00:58.079> finished<00:00:58.620> perfect<00:00:59.100> illustration<00:00:59.280> it

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
want to finished perfect illustration it

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.400 
want to finished perfect illustration it
allows<00:01:00.180> me<00:01:00.390> to<00:01:00.480> really<00:01:00.660> play<00:01:00.989> with<00:01:01.020> the<00:01:01.140> lights

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
allows me to really play with the lights

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.329 
allows me to really play with the lights
a<00:01:01.559> lot<00:01:01.710> more<00:01:02.030> compared<00:01:03.030> to<00:01:03.390> if<00:01:03.600> I<00:01:03.719> go<00:01:03.870> over<00:01:04.019> into

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:04.339 
a lot more compared to if I go over into

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:08.359 
a lot more compared to if I go over into
cycles<00:01:05.339> render<00:01:06.680> and<00:01:07.680> do<00:01:07.830> his<00:01:07.979> cycles

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
cycles render and do his cycles

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.990 
cycles render and do his cycles
rendering<00:01:10.220> you<00:01:11.220> know<00:01:11.369> it's<00:01:11.549> kind<00:01:11.820> of<00:01:11.850> a

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
rendering you know it's kind of a

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.359 
rendering you know it's kind of a
certain<00:01:12.510> kind<00:01:12.810> of<00:01:12.869> realism<00:01:13.350> to<00:01:13.560> me<00:01:13.890> that<00:01:14.159> just

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
certain kind of realism to me that just

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.580 
certain kind of realism to me that just
doesn't<00:01:14.430> I<00:01:14.939> don't<00:01:15.540> know<00:01:15.600> I<00:01:15.630> mean<00:01:15.780> part<00:01:16.350> of<00:01:16.439> I

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
doesn't I don't know I mean part of I

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.260 
doesn't I don't know I mean part of I
like<00:01:16.920> but<00:01:17.659> part<00:01:18.659> of<00:01:18.750> it<00:01:18.840> is<00:01:19.610> you<00:01:20.610> know<00:01:20.670> if<00:01:21.090> I

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
like but part of it is you know if I

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.580 
like but part of it is you know if I
start<00:01:21.570> adjusting<00:01:21.689> the<00:01:22.049> lights<00:01:22.259> it<00:01:22.380> almost

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
start adjusting the lights it almost

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.609 
start adjusting the lights it almost
looks<00:01:22.799> too<00:01:22.979> real<00:01:23.310> for<00:01:23.580> me<00:01:23.670> I<00:01:23.700> wanted<00:01:24.000> more

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:24.619 
looks too real for me I wanted more

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:27.590 
looks too real for me I wanted more
fantasy<00:01:25.619> oriented<00:01:26.369> like<00:01:27.030> that<00:01:27.240> and<00:01:27.479> then<00:01:27.570> I

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
fantasy oriented like that and then I

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.149 
fantasy oriented like that and then I
have<00:01:27.810> to<00:01:27.930> change<00:01:28.170> things<00:01:28.470> up<00:01:28.680> as<00:01:28.829> far<00:01:29.040> as

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
have to change things up as far as

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.010 
have to change things up as far as
making<00:01:29.400> the<00:01:29.729> way<00:01:29.850> things<00:01:30.119> glow<00:01:30.479> I'd<00:01:30.780> have<00:01:30.900> to

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
making the way things glow I'd have to

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.749 
making the way things glow I'd have to
turn<00:01:31.200> yet<00:01:31.950> really<00:01:32.189> have<00:01:32.280> to<00:01:32.369> change<00:01:32.610> the

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
turn yet really have to change the

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.670 
turn yet really have to change the
effects<00:01:33.030> a<00:01:33.119> lot<00:01:33.150> but<00:01:33.960> one<00:01:34.350> of<00:01:34.439> the<00:01:34.500> nice<00:01:34.650> things

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
effects a lot but one of the nice things

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.880 
effects a lot but one of the nice things
about<00:01:35.329> this<00:01:36.329> implementation<00:01:36.930> in<00:01:37.229> cycles<00:01:37.680> is

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
about this implementation in cycles is

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.859 
about this implementation in cycles is
that<00:01:38.100> you<00:01:38.250> have<00:01:38.460> render<00:01:38.880> mode<00:01:39.030> active<00:01:39.630> now

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
that you have render mode active now

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.670 
that you have render mode active now
because<00:01:40.530> back<00:01:40.770> in<00:01:40.979> blender<00:01:41.310> render<00:01:42.560> you<00:01:43.560> only

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
because back in blender render you only

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.350 
because back in blender render you only
had<00:01:43.979> back<00:01:44.460> in<00:01:44.579> the<00:01:44.640> old<00:01:44.790> days<00:01:44.970> you<00:01:45.060> only<00:01:45.119> had

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
had back in the old days you only had

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.149 
had back in the old days you only had
solvent<00:01:45.869> texture<00:01:46.200> but<00:01:46.380> now<00:01:46.500> you<00:01:46.560> notice<00:01:46.979> I'm

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
solvent texture but now you notice I'm

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.490 
solvent texture but now you notice I'm
sitting<00:01:47.909> here<00:01:48.180> in<00:01:48.329> render<00:01:48.659> mode<00:01:48.869> in<00:01:49.140> blender

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
sitting here in render mode in blender

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.170 
sitting here in render mode in blender
render<00:01:49.860> meaning<00:01:50.340> I'm<00:01:50.430> looking<00:01:50.729> at<00:01:50.850> my<00:01:50.939> final

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
render meaning I'm looking at my final

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.630 
render meaning I'm looking at my final
rendering<00:01:51.720> so<00:01:52.320> if<00:01:52.590> I<00:01:52.740> just<00:01:52.950> even<00:01:53.369> just<00:01:53.520> by

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
rendering so if I just even just by

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.460 
rendering so if I just even just by
moving<00:01:53.790> the<00:01:54.000> mouse<00:01:54.030> the<00:01:54.990> nice<00:01:55.229> thing<00:01:55.409> about

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
moving the mouse the nice thing about

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.560 
moving the mouse the nice thing about
these<00:01:55.710> GPUs<00:01:56.219> even<00:01:56.579> though<00:01:56.670> this<00:01:56.850> isn't<00:01:57.060> using

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
these GPUs even though this isn't using

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.410 
these GPUs even though this isn't using
the<00:01:57.659> GPU<00:01:58.049> it's<00:01:58.799> just<00:01:58.979> the<00:01:59.070> fast<00:01:59.340> was<00:02:00.000> not<00:02:00.240> that

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
the GPU it's just the fast was not that

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.420 
the GPU it's just the fast was not that
fast<00:02:00.659> of<00:02:00.810> a<00:02:00.869> computer<00:02:01.290> but<00:02:01.320> basically<00:02:02.219> I'm

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
fast of a computer but basically I'm

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.480 
fast of a computer but basically I'm
rendering<00:02:02.969> my<00:02:03.360> scene<00:02:04.280> interactively<00:02:05.280> like

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
rendering my scene interactively like

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.969 
rendering my scene interactively like
this<00:02:05.729> so<00:02:05.909> I<00:02:05.939> can<00:02:06.149> look<00:02:06.240> at<00:02:06.390> my<00:02:06.509> views<00:02:06.950> how<00:02:07.950> I

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
this so I can look at my views how I

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.880 
this so I can look at my views how I
want<00:02:08.369> and<00:02:08.610> really<00:02:09.270> test<00:02:09.509> them<00:02:09.720> out<00:02:09.810> so<00:02:10.500> it's<00:02:10.739> a

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
want and really test them out so it's a

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.690 
want and really test them out so it's a
it's<00:02:11.670> a<00:02:11.790> great<00:02:12.060> feature<00:02:12.840> for<00:02:13.230> me<00:02:13.349> but

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
it's a great feature for me but

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.790 
it's a great feature for me but
it<00:02:13.940> really<00:02:14.720> allows<00:02:15.020> you<00:02:15.200> to<00:02:15.319> see<00:02:15.500> you<00:02:15.590> work

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
it really allows you to see you work

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.369 
it really allows you to see you work
quickly<00:02:16.099> and<00:02:16.610> these<00:02:17.420> kind<00:02:17.750> of<00:02:17.810> light<00:02:18.019> effects

00:02:18.369 --> 00:02:18.379 
quickly and these kind of light effects

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:20.400 
quickly and these kind of light effects
they're<00:02:18.680> just<00:02:19.010> certain<00:02:19.550> things<00:02:19.730> are<00:02:19.819> just

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
they're just certain things are just

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:23.229 
they're just certain things are just
more<00:02:21.410> conducive<00:02:21.769> to<00:02:22.040> blend<00:02:22.670> to<00:02:22.760> render<00:02:23.060> so

00:02:23.229 --> 00:02:23.239 
more conducive to blend to render so

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:26.440 
more conducive to blend to render so
don't<00:02:23.390> discount<00:02:23.720> it<00:02:23.900> as<00:02:24.050> it<00:02:24.230> renders<00:02:24.590> all<00:02:25.450> of

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
don't discount it as it renders all of

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:27.940 
don't discount it as it renders all of
itself<00:02:26.720> just<00:02:27.050> depends<00:02:27.349> on<00:02:27.410> what<00:02:27.560> projects

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
itself just depends on what projects

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.240 
itself just depends on what projects
you're<00:02:28.069> working<00:02:28.099> on<00:02:28.519> and<00:02:29.860> so<00:02:30.860> I<00:02:30.890> just<00:02:31.040> wanted

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
you're working on and so I just wanted

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:32.589 
you're working on and so I just wanted
to<00:02:31.310> point<00:02:31.519> that<00:02:31.610> out<00:02:31.700> because<00:02:31.880> this<00:02:32.239> story<00:02:32.510> is
