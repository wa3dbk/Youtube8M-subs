so<00:01:40.470> it's<00:01:40.619> not<00:01:40.650> on<00:01:40.829> there<00:01:41.009> properly<00:01:41.189> is<00:01:41.490> going

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
so it's not on there properly is going

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:42.889 
so it's not on there properly is going
to<00:01:41.670> definitely<00:01:41.820> leak<00:01:42.090> debris<00:01:42.420> back<00:01:42.630> in<00:01:42.810> the

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
to definitely leak debris back in the

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.990 
to definitely leak debris back in the
pool<00:01:43.079> and<00:01:43.950> I<00:01:44.070> generally<00:01:44.460> don't<00:01:44.549> take<00:01:44.759> the<00:01:44.880> big

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
pool and I generally don't take the big

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.460 
pool and I generally don't take the big
one<00:01:45.180> out<00:01:45.210> unless<00:01:45.630> I<00:01:45.750> really<00:01:45.899> have<00:01:46.170> to<00:01:46.350> is

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
one out unless I really have to is

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.010 
one out unless I really have to is
pretty<00:01:46.680> heavy<00:01:46.890> and<00:01:47.159> awkward<00:01:47.880> so<00:01:48.299> I<00:01:48.360> just<00:01:48.540> clean

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
pretty heavy and awkward so I just clean

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.260 
pretty heavy and awkward so I just clean
it<00:01:49.049> off<00:01:49.229> inside<00:01:49.700> here<00:01:50.700> and<00:01:50.880> let<00:01:51.000> the<00:01:51.090> water

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
it off inside here and let the water

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.190 
it off inside here and let the water
drain<00:01:51.540> out

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.720 

make<00:01:55.200> sure<00:01:55.350> not<00:01:55.530> only<00:01:55.590> do<00:01:55.950> the<00:01:56.130> outside<00:01:56.580> we

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
out of it

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.060 
out of it
these<00:02:12.690> filter<00:02:12.960> to<00:02:13.170> pick<00:02:13.470> up<00:02:13.590> a<00:02:13.650> lot<00:02:13.800> of<00:02:13.830> dirt

don't<00:02:45.180> take<00:02:45.450> either<00:02:46.170> one<00:02:46.440> out<00:02:46.820> you<00:02:47.820> have<00:02:48.000> to

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
don't take either one out you have to

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.030 
don't take either one out you have to
get<00:02:48.239> it<00:02:48.360> listed<00:02:48.690> on<00:02:48.930> there<00:02:49.140> right<00:02:49.380> otherwise

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
get it listed on there right otherwise

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.680 
get it listed on there right otherwise
it<00:02:50.310> gets<00:02:50.520> wobbly<00:02:51.030> so<00:02:51.150> it<00:02:51.239> only<00:02:51.360> goes<00:02:51.540> in<00:02:51.660> one

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
it gets wobbly so it only goes in one

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:52.270 
it gets wobbly so it only goes in one
way

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
way

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.550 
way
wobble<00:02:53.280> are<00:02:53.670> not<00:02:53.850> too<00:02:54.000> much<00:02:54.180> wobble<00:02:54.560> otherwise

wobble are not too much wobble otherwise

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.020 
wobble are not too much wobble otherwise
it's<00:02:55.800> not<00:02:55.890> going<00:02:56.040> to<00:02:56.130> filter<00:02:56.310> properly<00:02:56.910> so

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
it's not going to filter properly so

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:58.370 
it's not going to filter properly so
it's<00:02:57.150> going<00:02:57.239> to<00:02:57.300> sit<00:02:57.480> on<00:02:57.510> there<00:02:57.780> good<00:02:57.900> and<00:02:57.959> firm

you try to do it clean the drain area
and<00:04:11.819> we'll<00:04:11.909> reattach<00:04:12.180> this<00:04:12.690> I'm<00:04:12.959> gonna<00:04:13.140> go

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260 
and we'll reattach this I'm gonna go

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.250 
and we'll reattach this I'm gonna go
ahead<00:04:13.319> and<00:04:13.440> spray<00:04:13.829> it<00:04:13.980> with<00:04:14.010> some<00:04:14.220> silicone

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:15.260 
ahead and spray it with some silicone

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:20.029 
ahead and spray it with some silicone
also<00:04:16.519> ring<00:04:17.519> here<00:04:17.729> also<00:04:18.799> wouldn't<00:04:19.799> recommend

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:20.039 
also ring here also wouldn't recommend

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:21.740 
also ring here also wouldn't recommend
turning<00:04:20.400> on<00:04:20.489> system<00:04:20.880> flushing<00:04:21.299> out<00:04:21.419> any<00:04:21.539> dirt

turning on system flushing out any dirt
in<00:04:21.870> there<00:04:22.160> sometimes<00:04:23.160> this<00:04:23.340> drain<00:04:23.490> is

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
in there sometimes this drain is

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:25.040 
in there sometimes this drain is
actually<00:04:23.910> pointing<00:04:24.060> right<00:04:24.270> at<00:04:24.330> the<00:04:24.510> motor<00:04:24.720> and

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.050 
actually pointing right at the motor and

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:26.659 
actually pointing right at the motor and
you'll<00:04:25.590> burn<00:04:25.740> out<00:04:25.889> the<00:04:25.979> motor<00:04:26.010> pretty<00:04:26.400> quickly

00:04:26.659 --> 00:04:26.669 
you'll burn out the motor pretty quickly

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:28.250 
you'll burn out the motor pretty quickly
with<00:04:26.880> the<00:04:26.970> high-pressure<00:04:27.330> water<00:04:27.690> hitting<00:04:28.020> it

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:28.260 
with the high-pressure water hitting it

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:29.960 
with the high-pressure water hitting it
and<00:04:28.500> it's<00:04:28.949> really<00:04:29.100> ineffective<00:04:29.460> to<00:04:29.729> get<00:04:29.850> that

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:29.970 
and it's really ineffective to get that

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:32.450 
and it's really ineffective to get that
dirt<00:04:30.150> out<00:04:30.300> when<00:04:30.570> you<00:04:30.660> turn<00:04:30.810> on<00:04:30.840> really<00:04:31.460> and

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:32.460 
dirt out when you turn on really and

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:33.860 
dirt out when you turn on really and
we'll<00:04:32.550> get<00:04:32.669> our<00:04:32.760> handy<00:04:33.000> screwdriver<00:04:33.539> and

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:33.870 
we'll get our handy screwdriver and

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:35.629 
we'll get our handy screwdriver and
we'll<00:04:33.960> just<00:04:34.139> turn<00:04:34.289> this<00:04:34.530> so<00:04:34.710> it's<00:04:34.860> tight<00:04:35.130> not

00:04:35.629 --> 00:04:35.639 
we'll just turn this so it's tight not

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:38.110 
we'll just turn this so it's tight not
over<00:04:35.850> tight<00:04:36.090> but<00:04:36.360> we're<00:04:37.080> not<00:04:37.289> going<00:04:37.380> to<00:04:37.470> leak

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:38.120 
over tight but we're not going to leak

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:40.640 
over tight but we're not going to leak
and<00:04:39.120> why<00:04:39.240> I<00:04:39.300> clean<00:04:39.570> the<00:04:39.660> filter<00:04:39.930> I<00:04:39.960> also<00:04:40.169> soak

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:40.650 
and why I clean the filter I also soak

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:42.620 
and why I clean the filter I also soak
the<00:04:40.800> salt<00:04:41.039> selling<00:04:41.340> some<00:04:41.460> acid<00:04:41.910> I'm<00:04:42.419> going<00:04:42.570> to

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:42.630 
the salt selling some acid I'm going to

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:43.760 
the salt selling some acid I'm going to
reattach<00:04:42.810> it<00:04:43.139> before<00:04:43.380> I<00:04:43.410> turn<00:04:43.560> everything

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:43.770 
reattach it before I turn everything

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:47.029 
reattach it before I turn everything
back<00:04:43.889> on<00:04:44.900> and<00:04:45.900> that's<00:04:46.080> little<00:04:46.260> bonus<00:04:46.650> tip<00:04:46.680> for

00:04:47.029 --> 00:04:47.039 
back on and that's little bonus tip for

00:04:47.039 --> 00:04:48.110 
back on and that's little bonus tip for
you<00:04:47.130> while<00:04:47.280> you're<00:04:47.400> doing<00:04:47.610> your<00:04:47.639> filter<00:04:48.030> you

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:48.120 
you while you're doing your filter you

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.120 
you while you're doing your filter you
can<00:04:48.210> also<00:04:48.389> do<00:04:48.720> your<00:04:48.780> salt<00:04:49.050> sell<00:04:49.320> since<00:04:49.979> you'll

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:50.130 
can also do your salt sell since you'll

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:52.129 
can also do your salt sell since you'll
have<00:04:50.220> your<00:04:50.460> filter<00:04:50.849> down<00:04:51.000> for<00:04:51.210> about<00:04:51.300> 20-30

00:04:52.129 --> 00:04:52.139 
have your filter down for about 20-30

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:54.409 
have your filter down for about 20-30
minutes<00:04:52.470> cleaning<00:04:52.979> it<00:04:53.160> and<00:04:53.669> it's<00:04:53.940> all<00:04:54.060> silicon

00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:54.419 
minutes cleaning it and it's all silicon

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:57.560 
minutes cleaning it and it's all silicon
so<00:04:54.539> connect<00:04:54.840> for<00:04:54.990> that<00:04:55.110> time<00:04:56.330> and<00:04:57.330> turn

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:57.570 
so connect for that time and turn

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:59.390 
so connect for that time and turn
everything<00:04:57.780> back<00:04:57.900> on<00:04:58.229> I'll<00:04:58.889> take<00:04:59.039> a<00:04:59.070> minute<00:04:59.340> to

00:04:59.390 --> 00:04:59.400 
everything back on I'll take a minute to

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:02.010 
everything back on I'll take a minute to
fry<00:04:59.580> them<00:04:59.760> up
