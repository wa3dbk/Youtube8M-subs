I don't know it feels a little
differently<00:00:14.040> to<00:00:14.130> get<00:00:14.220> away<00:00:14.310> from<00:00:14.430> a<00:00:14.520> racetrack

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
differently to get away from a racetrack

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.120 
differently to get away from a racetrack
we<00:00:15.030> got<00:00:15.180> a<00:00:15.210> lot<00:00:15.330> more<00:00:15.360> time<00:00:15.750> have<00:00:16.590> been<00:00:16.740> racing

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
we got a lot more time have been racing

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.310 
we got a lot more time have been racing
a<00:00:17.189> whole<00:00:17.310> lot<00:00:17.520> but<00:00:17.779> when<00:00:18.779> to<00:00:18.869> come<00:00:19.019> here<00:00:19.259> and

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
a whole lot but when to come here and

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.050 
a whole lot but when to come here and
run<00:00:19.529> so<00:00:19.800> we<00:00:19.949> will<00:00:20.009> probably<00:00:20.249> run<00:00:20.519> here<00:00:20.580> in<00:00:20.939> a

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
run so we will probably run here in a

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.130 
run so we will probably run here in a

70s early 80s and all the way through

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.770 
70s early 80s and all the way through
the<00:01:04.559> 90s<00:01:04.890> actually<00:01:05.339> we've<00:01:06.240> all<00:01:06.390> been<00:01:06.570> in<00:01:06.750> a

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
the 90s actually we've all been in a

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.359 
the 90s actually we've all been in a
long<00:01:07.020> time<00:01:07.259> and<00:01:07.320> you<00:01:07.740> know<00:01:07.829> we<00:01:07.979> can't<00:01:08.159> do<00:01:08.280> it

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
long time and you know we can't do it

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.310 
long time and you know we can't do it
forever<00:01:08.490> so<00:01:08.939> uh<00:01:08.970> this<00:01:09.780> is<00:01:09.900> probably<00:01:10.079> the<00:01:10.200> last

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
forever so uh this is probably the last

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.830 
forever so uh this is probably the last
time<00:01:10.590> here<00:01:10.829> I<00:01:11.009> remember<00:01:11.909> an<00:01:12.090> amazing<00:01:12.659> match

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
time here I remember an amazing match

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.260 
time here I remember an amazing match
race<00:01:13.170> between<00:01:13.200> yourself<00:01:13.979> Sammy<00:01:14.460> and<00:01:14.759> the<00:01:15.060> wolf

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
race between yourself Sammy and the wolf

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.480 
race between yourself Sammy and the wolf
three<00:01:15.930> wide<00:01:16.170> three<00:01:16.680> times<00:01:17.009> do<00:01:17.250> you<00:01:17.280> remember

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
three wide three times do you remember

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.090 
three wide three times do you remember
that<00:01:17.670> oh<00:01:18.200> we've<00:01:19.200> done<00:01:19.350> a<00:01:19.380> lot<00:01:19.560> of<00:01:19.590> things<00:01:19.829> over

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
that oh we've done a lot of things over

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.530 
that oh we've done a lot of things over
the<00:01:20.189> years<00:01:20.220> or<00:01:20.579> so<00:01:20.790> I<00:01:20.939> can't<00:01:21.210> remember

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540

the years or so I can't remember
everything<00:01:21.689> we've<00:01:21.899> done<00:01:22.020> but<00:01:22.320> quite<00:01:22.890> a<00:01:22.920> few

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
everything we've done but quite a few

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.889 
everything we've done but quite a few
things<00:01:23.310> yeah<00:01:23.820> it<00:01:23.909> was<00:01:24.030> a<00:01:24.060> pretty<00:01:24.180> radical<00:01:24.479> idea

00:01:24.889 --> 00:01:24.899 
things yeah it was a pretty radical idea

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:26.569 
things yeah it was a pretty radical idea
to<00:01:25.020> start<00:01:25.200> you<00:01:25.350> guys<00:01:25.500> three<00:01:25.890> wide<00:01:26.100> and<00:01:26.369> do<00:01:26.460> like

00:01:26.569 --> 00:01:26.579 
to start you guys three wide and do like

00:01:26.579 --> 00:01:28.069 
to start you guys three wide and do like
a<00:01:26.670> match<00:01:26.880> race<00:01:27.149> series<00:01:27.479> pretty<00:01:27.840> different

00:01:28.069 --> 00:01:28.079 
a match race series pretty different

00:01:28.079 --> 00:01:29.840 
a match race series pretty different
