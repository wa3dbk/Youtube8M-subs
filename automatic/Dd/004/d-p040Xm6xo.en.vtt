00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.789 
and it takes quite a bit for the full
client<00:01:18.030> so<00:01:18.540> just<00:01:18.810> be<00:01:19.229> aware<00:01:19.259> of<00:01:19.560> that

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
client so just be aware of that

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.969 
client so just be aware of that
especially<00:01:20.040> I<00:01:20.759> have<00:01:20.880> fiber<00:01:21.420> internet<00:01:21.869> so<00:01:22.259> you

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
especially I have fiber internet so you

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.609 
especially I have fiber internet so you
know<00:01:23.070> it's<00:01:23.729> a<00:01:23.759> little<00:01:23.939> faster<00:01:24.360> for<00:01:24.390> me<00:01:24.570> but<00:01:25.080> if

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
know it's a little faster for me but if

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:26.960 
know it's a little faster for me but if
you<00:01:25.680> have<00:01:25.799> a<00:01:25.860> bit<00:01:26.070> of<00:01:26.159> slower<00:01:26.400> internet<00:01:26.610> it

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
you have a bit of slower internet it

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.569 
you have a bit of slower internet it
will<00:01:27.150> take<00:01:27.390> even<00:01:27.570> more<00:01:27.720> time<00:01:27.869> so<00:01:28.680> just<00:01:29.130> you

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
will take even more time so just you

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.640 
will take even more time so just you
know<00:01:29.700> pick<00:01:30.329> a<00:01:30.390> day<00:01:30.600> where<00:01:30.990> you<00:01:31.350> have<00:01:31.380> some<00:01:32.310> time

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:33.650 
know pick a day where you have some time

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:37.069 
know pick a day where you have some time
so<00:01:34.650> what<00:01:34.979> I<00:01:35.009> did<00:01:35.130> was<00:01:35.549> since<00:01:36.450> I<00:01:36.630> already<00:01:36.720> had<00:01:36.960> it

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
so what I did was since I already had it

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.539 
so what I did was since I already had it
installed<00:01:37.290> you<00:01:37.530> pretty<00:01:37.829> much<00:01:37.920> just<00:01:37.979> drag<00:01:38.400> it

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
to wait for the download because again

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.350 
to wait for the download because again
it<00:01:45.869> takes<00:01:45.990> time<00:01:46.290> because<00:01:47.040> I'm<00:01:47.280> lazy<00:01:47.460> are

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:06.540 
see it on my channel it's not hard to

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:10.190 
see it on my channel it's not hard to
run<00:05:06.750> so<00:05:07.550> oh<00:05:08.550> by<00:05:09.180> the<00:05:09.210> way<00:05:09.330> if<00:05:09.570> you<00:05:09.720> don't<00:05:09.960> have

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:10.200

fallout 2 you just won't get into music
I<00:05:12.360> think<00:05:12.750> that<00:05:12.870> was<00:05:13.080> what<00:05:13.290> it<00:05:13.380> was<00:05:13.530> and<00:05:13.950> that

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:14.520 
I think that was what it was and that

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:16.700 
I think that was what it was and that
might<00:05:14.760> be<00:05:14.940> there<00:05:15.630> I<00:05:15.660> don't<00:05:15.930> know<00:05:16.350> I'm<00:05:16.530> just

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:16.710 
might be there I don't know I'm just

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:18.950 
might be there I don't know I'm just
making<00:05:17.250> up<00:05:17.340> things<00:05:17.520> so<00:05:18.300> when<00:05:18.540> you're<00:05:18.660> done<00:05:18.750> hit

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:18.960 
making up things so when you're done hit

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:20.510 
making up things so when you're done hit
saved<00:05:19.260> that<00:05:19.590> all<00:05:19.800> my<00:05:19.919> stuff<00:05:20.130> just<00:05:20.310> closed<00:05:20.490> down

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:20.520 
saved that all my stuff just closed down

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:25.580 
saved that all my stuff just closed down
-<00:05:21.419> all<00:05:22.320> right<00:05:22.970> so<00:05:23.970> what<00:05:24.360> do<00:05:24.419> you<00:05:24.510> launch<00:05:24.720> to<00:05:25.229> run

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:25.590 
- all right so what do you launch to run

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:27.710 
- all right so what do you launch to run
this<00:05:25.800> well<00:05:26.100> you<00:05:26.460> launch<00:05:26.850> the<00:05:27.090> follow<00:05:27.270> line

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:27.720 
this well you launch the follow line

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:31.420 
this well you launch the follow line
launcher<00:05:28.110> and<00:05:28.320> that's<00:05:28.530> way<00:05:28.830> too<00:05:28.860> big<00:05:30.080> and

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:31.430 
launcher and that's way too big and

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:34.899 
launcher and that's way too big and
she's<00:05:32.430> going<00:05:32.550> fullscreen

00:05:34.899 --> 00:05:34.909 

00:05:34.909 --> 00:05:38.800
