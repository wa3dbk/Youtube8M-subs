00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:08.040
 so sony xperia z4 tablet 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.759
 compact 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:14.660
 Well, in the company sony assures that 

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:18.779
 use some kind of glass for 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:21.689
 close screen matrix 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:25.310
 Well, we are in fact the glass and 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:33.059
 you test the usual 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:35.040
 screw screw if you think the same if someone 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.739
 thinks I'm here and some bullshit 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.860
 here it takes that there barely touch something in 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:43.280
 principle nothing like that is i am everything 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:47.420
 I do it in all seriousness 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:51.840
 that is, without any dirty trick so to speak 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:56.910
 well what can you do here you need a tablet for 47 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:01:08.150
 thousand so to say test here 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:10.890
 we have a knife here all over the screen well 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:25.400
 Well, let's give what everyone has 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:25.400
 pocket keys wipe screen 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:33.470
 so let's try not to look 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:44.930
 I know how well the camera will convey 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:49.380
 but I assure you that absolutely no 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:54.650
 Scratches on the screen are not visible in principle I 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.650
 I think you can 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:05.870
 see for yourself in principle yes 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:08.320
 glass is quite effective for everyone 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:08.320
 thank
