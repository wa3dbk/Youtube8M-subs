forward left forward tritek etc etc
after<00:01:48.450> it<00:01:48.780> finish<00:01:49.140> refinishes<00:01:50.070> ask<00:01:50.640> where<00:01:50.820> it

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
after it finish refinishes ask where it

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.980 
after it finish refinishes ask where it
goes<00:01:51.530> forward<00:01:52.700> right<00:01:53.700> to<00:01:53.880> the<00:01:54.060> end<00:01:54.149> and<00:01:54.509> back

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
goes forward right to the end and back

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.719 
goes forward right to the end and back
to<00:01:55.200> the<00:01:55.320> start<00:01:56.030> to<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:57.180> depth<00:01:57.600> you<00:01:57.840> desire

in the world yes what's so what what is
it<00:02:41.240> doing<00:02:41.390> now<00:02:41.510> it's<00:02:42.470> so<00:02:42.740> its<00:02:42.920> mining<00:02:43.340> its

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 
it doing now it's so its mining its

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.770 
it doing now it's so its mining its
mannequin<00:02:44.180> a<00:02:44.209> huge<00:02:44.720> better<00:02:46.120> just<00:02:47.120> to<00:02:47.270> show<00:02:47.480> an

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
mannequin a huge better just to show an

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.080 
mannequin a huge better just to show an
example<00:02:48.110> and<00:02:48.800> then<00:02:49.010> I<00:02:49.280> think<00:02:49.670> it<00:02:49.820> the<00:02:49.970> next

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
example and then I think it the next

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:52.360 
example and then I think it the next
time<00:02:50.239> i<00:02:50.600> will<00:02:50.750> just<00:02:51.140> use<00:02:51.260> it<00:02:51.739> to<00:02:51.860> make<00:02:51.980> a<00:02:52.040> house

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
time i will just use it to make a house

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:55.060 
time i will just use it to make a house
or<00:02:52.610> something<00:02:53.470> okay<00:02:54.470> cuz<00:02:54.680> that<00:02:54.800> would<00:02:54.920> be

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:55.070 
or something okay cuz that would be

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:57.490 
or something okay cuz that would be
basically<00:02:55.580> the<00:02:56.000> animation<00:02:56.630> of<00:02:56.720> the<00:02:56.780> pickaxe<00:02:57.320> i

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
basically the animation of the pickaxe i

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.190 
basically the animation of the pickaxe i
think<00:02:57.709> it's<00:02:57.830> better<00:02:58.280> than<00:02:58.489> on<00:02:59.150> the<00:02:59.209> actual

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
think it's better than on the actual

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:03.820 
think it's better than on the actual
