makes it compelling because it is a
story<00:01:26.970> it<00:01:27.270> is

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
story it is

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.039

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.060 
life and his work and and so it's we are

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.730 
life and his work and and so it's we are
there<00:01:36.060> that's<00:01:36.570> the<00:01:36.869> music<00:01:36.990> has<00:01:37.320> to<00:01:37.350> come<00:01:37.530> alive

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
there that's the music has to come alive

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.530 
there that's the music has to come alive
as<00:01:37.890> if<00:01:38.009> we<00:01:38.130> were<00:01:38.250> actually<00:01:38.790> there<00:01:38.970> and<00:01:39.150> in<00:01:39.420> the

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
as if we were actually there and in the

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.020 
as if we were actually there and in the
course<00:01:39.750> of<00:01:39.840> the<00:01:39.960> action<00:01:40.159> so<00:01:41.159> that's<00:01:41.820> how

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
course of the action so that's how

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.359 
course of the action so that's how
challenge<00:01:42.570> the<00:01:43.320> choral<00:01:43.590> Union<00:01:43.619> tends<00:01:44.159> to

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
challenge the choral Union tends to

00:01:44.369 --> 00:02:01.920 
challenge the choral Union tends to
always<00:01:44.759> rise<00:01:44.970> to<00:01:45.000> the<00:01:45.390> occasion

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:01.930 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:04.840 

we've<00:02:02.930> grown<00:02:03.110> in<00:02:03.350> numbers<00:02:03.740> the<00:02:04.520> group<00:02:04.700> has

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:04.850 
we've grown in numbers the group has

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:06.640 
we've grown in numbers the group has
gotten<00:02:05.090> a<00:02:05.210> lot<00:02:05.360> larger<00:02:05.600> I<00:02:05.869> would<00:02:06.229> say<00:02:06.409> we've

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:06.650 
gotten a lot larger I would say we've

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:12.130 
gotten a lot larger I would say we've
grown<00:02:07.010> in<00:02:07.430> in<00:02:08.050> selectivity<00:02:09.610> how<00:02:10.750> we<00:02:11.750> can<00:02:11.959> make

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
grown in in selectivity how we can make

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.949 
grown in in selectivity how we can make
choices<00:02:12.350> from<00:02:12.770> those<00:02:12.980> who<00:02:13.190> audition<00:02:13.730> we<00:02:14.720> have

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:14.959 
choices from those who audition we have

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:18.280 
choices from those who audition we have
grown<00:02:15.290> in<00:02:16.300> balance<00:02:17.300> the<00:02:17.510> balance<00:02:17.630> is<00:02:17.989> a<00:02:18.020> little

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
grown in balance the balance is a little

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:19.930 
grown in balance the balance is a little
better<00:02:18.470> between<00:02:18.709> sparrow<00:02:19.160> alto<00:02:19.520> tenor<00:02:19.670> bass

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
better between sparrow alto tenor bass

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:23.020 
better between sparrow alto tenor bass

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
something that I could say to the choral

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.130 
something that I could say to the choral
Union<00:02:32.569> as<00:02:33.080> I<00:02:33.200> leave<00:02:33.470> them<00:02:33.800> and<00:02:34.750> that<00:02:35.750> sounds

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
Union as I leave them and that sounds

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:37.780 
Union as I leave them and that sounds
awfully<00:02:36.440> final<00:02:36.920> because<00:02:37.100> we<00:02:37.280> still<00:02:37.610> have<00:02:37.730> a

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
awfully final because we still have a

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.820 
awfully final because we still have a
whole<00:02:38.030> lot<00:02:38.209> of<00:02:38.239> work<00:02:38.480> to<00:02:38.660> do<00:02:39.580> would<00:02:40.580> just<00:02:40.610> be<00:02:40.910> to

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:41.830 
whole lot of work to do would just be to

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:44.350 
whole lot of work to do would just be to
let<00:02:42.830> them<00:02:43.010> know<00:02:43.160> how<00:02:43.340> grateful<00:02:43.610> I<00:02:43.820> am<00:02:43.850> to<00:02:44.209> them
