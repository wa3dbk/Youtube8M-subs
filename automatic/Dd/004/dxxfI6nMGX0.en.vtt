bowls<00:00:34.820> this<00:00:35.820> is<00:00:36.030> a<00:00:36.059> Sycamore<00:00:38.059> this<00:00:39.059> is<00:00:39.239> older

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
bowls this is a Sycamore this is older

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.220 
bowls this is a Sycamore this is older
so<00:00:40.969> today<00:00:41.969> we'll<00:00:42.180> be<00:00:42.300> taking<00:00:42.629> down<00:00:42.780> an<00:00:42.960> alder

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
so today we'll be taking down an alder

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.220 
so today we'll be taking down an alder
tree<00:00:43.879> nothing<00:00:44.879> about<00:00:45.030> coppicing<00:00:45.660> which<00:00:46.079> is

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
tree nothing about coppicing which is

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.549 
tree nothing about coppicing which is
what<00:00:46.410> we<00:00:46.530> do<00:00:46.680> is<00:00:46.890> some<00:00:47.840> tree<00:00:48.840> grows<00:00:49.079> again<00:00:49.410> if

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
what we do is some tree grows again if

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.610 
what we do is some tree grows again if
you<00:00:49.649> cut<00:00:49.829> it<00:00:49.860> in<00:00:50.070> winter<00:00:50.510> so<00:00:51.510> go<00:00:51.690> down<00:00:52.590> the

woods now we've got a good selection of
trees<00:00:54.390> down<00:00:55.230> there<00:00:55.590> two<00:00:56.219> copies

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
trees down there two copies

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.709 
trees down there two copies
you<00:00:57.300> can't<00:00:57.570> copy<00:00:57.780> some<00:00:58.260> pine<00:00:59.039> trees<00:00:59.460> or<00:00:59.820> of

you can't copy some pine trees or of
evergreens<00:01:01.500> they<00:01:01.890> just<00:01:02.100> die<00:01:02.280> if<00:01:02.460> you<00:01:02.579> cut<00:01:02.789> them

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
evergreens they just die if you cut them

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.950 
evergreens they just die if you cut them
but<00:01:03.329> um<00:01:03.739> most<00:01:04.739> of<00:01:04.979> the<00:01:05.250> species<00:01:05.880> of<00:01:06.299> hard<00:01:06.540> wood

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
but um most of the species of hard wood

broad leaves that grow in Britain you

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.750 
broad leaves that grow in Britain you
can<00:01:09.810> cut<00:01:10.049> this<00:01:10.229> so<00:01:10.939> from<00:01:12.409> apple<00:01:13.409> trees<00:01:13.770> older

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
can cut this so from apple trees older

all those you can you can cut and

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.810 
all those you can you can cut and
they'll<00:01:24.000> grow<00:01:24.210> again<00:01:25.009> before<00:01:26.009> we<00:01:26.189> set<00:01:26.369> off<00:01:26.549> um

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
they'll grow again before we set off um

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.969 
they'll grow again before we set off um
or<00:01:27.780> just<00:01:27.840> sharp<00:01:28.290> on<00:01:28.439> a<00:01:28.470> couple<00:01:28.710> them<00:01:28.799> on<00:01:28.890> the

main tools this one is a double-handed
saw<00:01:33.079> so<00:01:34.079> we<00:01:34.110> don't<00:01:34.350> use<00:01:34.530> chainsaws<00:01:35.390> but<00:01:36.390> this

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
saw so we don't use chainsaws but this

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.430 
saw so we don't use chainsaws but this
is<00:01:36.689> fantastic<00:01:37.049> it's<00:01:37.470> a<00:01:37.530> Victorian<00:01:38.420> equivalent

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:40.440 
is fantastic it's a Victorian equivalent

is fantastic it's a Victorian equivalent
just<00:01:41.440> need<00:01:41.920> to<00:01:41.950> keep<00:01:42.370> it<00:01:42.610> in<00:01:42.730> trim<00:01:43.530> every<00:01:44.530> two

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:44.710 
just need to keep it in trim every two

just need to keep it in trim every two
or<00:01:44.800> three<00:01:44.830> times<00:01:45.190> we<00:01:45.460> go<00:01:45.610> out<00:01:48.240> and<00:01:49.240> sharpens<00:01:49.600> up

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:49.690 
or three times we go out and sharpens up

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:53.610 
or three times we go out and sharpens up
very<00:01:49.900> well<00:01:49.930> the<00:01:50.650> other<00:01:50.830> thing<00:01:51.070> is<00:01:52.620> this

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:57.010 
felling axe so I'll give this a quick

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:03.420 
felling axe so I'll give this a quick
trim<00:01:57.700> as<00:01:57.850> well<00:01:59.190> each<00:02:00.190> time<00:02:02.130> you<00:02:03.130> know<00:02:03.280> it's

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:03.430 
trim as well each time you know it's

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:08.600 
trim as well each time you know it's
sharp<00:02:03.730> when<00:02:03.910> you<00:02:03.970> can't<00:02:04.240> see<00:02:04.600> the<00:02:04.870> edge<00:02:04.990> and

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.370 

this<00:02:09.610> is<00:02:09.790> a<00:02:09.820> nice<00:02:10.060> little<00:02:10.270> gadget<00:02:10.899> it's<00:02:11.110> a

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:11.380 
this is a nice little gadget it's a

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:15.960 
this is a nice little gadget it's a
steel<00:02:12.250> with<00:02:12.610> diamond<00:02:13.480> dust<00:02:13.780> set<00:02:14.470> in<00:02:14.650> it<00:02:14.970> and

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
steel with diamond dust set in it and

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:17.310 
steel with diamond dust set in it and
you<00:02:16.060> can<00:02:16.210> buy<00:02:16.360> them<00:02:16.510> quite<00:02:16.870> cheaply<00:02:17.140> about

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:17.320 
you can buy them quite cheaply about

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:18.990 
you can buy them quite cheaply about
three<00:02:17.800> quid<00:02:18.040> something<00:02:18.280> like<00:02:18.370> that<00:02:18.520> for<00:02:18.730> quick

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
three quid something like that for quick

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.990 
three quid something like that for quick
but<00:02:19.600> it's<00:02:19.750> a<00:02:20.130> makes<00:02:21.130> a<00:02:21.250> really<00:02:21.490> good<00:02:21.640> edge<00:02:21.820> on

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
but it's a makes a really good edge on

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:28.140 
but it's a makes a really good edge on
things

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.929 

so<00:02:29.150> this<00:02:29.329> is<00:02:29.480> a<00:02:29.510> carbon<00:02:30.109> neutral<00:02:30.939> renewable

00:02:31.929 --> 00:02:31.939 
so this is a carbon neutral renewable

00:02:31.939 --> 00:02:35.319 
so this is a carbon neutral renewable
resource<00:02:33.400> this<00:02:34.400> was<00:02:34.579> a<00:02:34.609> tree<00:02:34.909> that<00:02:34.999> I<00:02:35.090> cut<00:02:35.299> down

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:35.329 
resource this was a tree that I cut down

00:02:35.329 --> 00:02:38.110 
resource this was a tree that I cut down
six<00:02:35.959> years<00:02:36.200> ago<00:02:36.469> made<00:02:37.219> that<00:02:37.430> fall<00:02:37.639> you<00:02:37.670> saw

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
six years ago made that fall you saw

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.500 
six years ago made that fall you saw
from<00:02:38.450> it<00:02:39.189> it<00:02:40.189> was<00:02:40.340> an<00:02:40.459> auditory<00:02:40.939> a<00:02:40.969> single<00:02:41.389> or

from it it was an auditory a single or
the<00:02:41.659> tree<00:02:41.900> and<00:02:42.609> now<00:02:43.609> it<00:02:45.219> it's<00:02:46.219> the<00:02:46.489> regrown

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
the tree and now it it's the regrown

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:50.709 
the tree and now it it's the regrown
from<00:02:47.420> the<00:02:47.599> base<00:02:47.859> it's<00:02:48.859> turned<00:02:49.219> into<00:02:49.400> about<00:02:49.719> ten

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:50.719 
from the base it's turned into about ten

00:02:50.719 --> 00:02:53.920 
from the base it's turned into about ten
all<00:02:50.870> the<00:02:50.900> trees<00:02:51.519> so<00:02:52.519> this<00:02:52.760> is<00:02:52.909> what<00:02:53.180> copper

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
all the trees so this is what copper

00:02:55.839 --> 00:02:55.849 
sings about you cut the tree in the

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:57.819 
sings about you cut the tree in the
winter<00:02:56.269> you<00:02:56.689> get<00:02:56.900> a<00:02:57.079> whole<00:02:57.349> new<00:02:57.530> load<00:02:57.709> of

winter you get a whole new load of

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:00.550 
winter you get a whole new load of
growth<00:02:58.010> so<00:02:58.280> it's<00:02:58.430> a<00:02:58.489> renewable<00:02:58.969> resort<00:02:59.560> manage

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
growth so it's a renewable resort manage

growth so it's a renewable resort manage
it<00:03:00.680> right<00:03:00.859> just<00:03:01.489> keeps<00:03:01.760> keeps<00:03:02.329> coming<00:03:02.859> what

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:03.859 
it right just keeps keeps coming what

it right just keeps keeps coming what
we'll<00:03:04.040> do<00:03:04.219> is<00:03:04.370> we'll<00:03:04.549> look<00:03:04.699> further<00:03:05.000> down<00:03:05.150> in

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480 
we'll do is we'll look further down in

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:05.890 
we'll do is we'll look further down in
there

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
there

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:10.089 
there
in<00:03:06.650> the<00:03:06.889> woods<00:03:07.129> for<00:03:07.519> a<00:03:08.560> similar<00:03:09.560> tree<00:03:09.859> and

00:03:10.089 --> 00:03:10.099 
in the woods for a similar tree and

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:13.390 
in the woods for a similar tree and
we'll<00:03:11.030> cut<00:03:11.209> that<00:03:11.329> down<00:03:12.069> I've<00:03:13.069> just<00:03:13.250> been

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400 
we'll cut that down I've just been

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.640 
we'll cut that down I've just been
cleaning<00:03:13.760> around<00:03:13.879> the<00:03:14.150> base<00:03:14.480> of<00:03:14.510> this<00:03:14.840> over

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.650 
cleaning around the base of this over

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:18.490 
cleaning around the base of this over
here<00:03:16.329> it's<00:03:17.329> a<00:03:17.480> good<00:03:17.659> one<00:03:17.810> to<00:03:17.959> caucus<00:03:18.290> because

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500 
here it's a good one to caucus because

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:21.399 
here it's a good one to caucus because
it's<00:03:19.060> a<00:03:20.060> bit<00:03:20.449> close<00:03:20.689> to<00:03:20.719> the<00:03:20.989> other<00:03:21.109> trees

00:03:21.399 --> 00:03:21.409 
it's a bit close to the other trees

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:23.170 
it's a bit close to the other trees
around<00:03:21.650> it<00:03:21.859> and<00:03:22.010> if<00:03:22.069> you've<00:03:22.189> got<00:03:22.430> one<00:03:22.609> leaning

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.180 
around it and if you've got one leaning

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.890 
around it and if you've got one leaning
right<00:03:23.299> on<00:03:23.480> it<00:03:23.680> it<00:03:24.680> can't<00:03:24.919> grow<00:03:25.189> any<00:03:25.459> further

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
right on it it can't grow any further

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:31.119 
right on it it can't grow any further
how<00:03:26.900> it<00:03:27.019> is<00:03:29.049> this<00:03:30.049> might<00:03:30.290> get<00:03:30.500> stuck<00:03:30.799> on<00:03:30.979> this

00:03:31.119 --> 00:03:31.129 
how it is this might get stuck on this

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:34.539 
how it is this might get stuck on this
tree<00:03:31.430> anyway<00:03:31.989> but<00:03:32.989> well<00:03:33.590> it's<00:03:33.769> gonna<00:03:34.040> aim<00:03:34.310> to

00:03:34.539 --> 00:03:34.549 
tree anyway but well it's gonna aim to

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:37.899 
tree anyway but well it's gonna aim to
send<00:03:34.819> it<00:03:34.970> that<00:03:35.180> way<00:03:35.979> so<00:03:36.979> I'll<00:03:37.280> cut<00:03:37.579> a<00:03:37.609> notch

00:03:37.899 --> 00:03:37.909 
send it that way so I'll cut a notch

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:41.439 
send it that way so I'll cut a notch
here<00:03:38.739> like<00:03:39.739> that<00:03:40.040> and<00:03:40.340> we'll<00:03:40.699> saw<00:03:40.970> in<00:03:41.150> from<00:03:41.359> the

00:03:41.439 --> 00:03:41.449 
here like that and we'll saw in from the

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:56.540 
here like that and we'll saw in from the
back

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:56.550 

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:00.240 

so<00:03:57.550> it<00:03:57.640> goes<00:03:57.790> straight<00:03:58.090> in<00:03:58.300> that<00:03:58.390> way<00:03:59.250> then

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:00.250 
so it goes straight in that way then

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:04.290 
so it goes straight in that way then
down<00:04:01.110> this<00:04:02.110> way<00:04:02.350> I<00:04:02.850> try<00:04:03.850> and<00:04:03.880> do<00:04:04.030> that<00:04:04.150> as

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:04.300 
down this way I try and do that as

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:07.350 
down this way I try and do that as
straight<00:04:04.570> as<00:04:04.660> possible<00:04:04.980> and<00:04:05.980> that<00:04:06.340> a<00:04:06.610> good

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:07.360 
straight as possible and that a good

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:10.020 
straight as possible and that a good
angle<00:04:07.690> to<00:04:07.720> meet<00:04:08.020> it<00:04:08.230> so<00:04:08.500> hopefully<00:04:09.460> we'll<00:04:09.820> meet

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:10.030 
angle to meet it so hopefully we'll meet

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:15.300 
angle to meet it so hopefully we'll meet
about<00:04:10.810> there<00:04:11.400> with<00:04:12.400> the<00:04:12.520> kind<00:04:12.760> of<00:04:13.980> birds<00:04:14.980> mouth
