00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:14.280
 Well, everyone knows that 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.900
 it's more like how are you I 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.730
 are going extremely well we end up 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.460
 today for two new videos 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.380
 so it will be on the dofus to present 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:26.449
 a little character that I created myself 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:28.740
 not very long so it's him then 

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:32.519
 finally you book that you govern them 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:35.730
 lodges me I'll call it some art 

00:00:32.519 --> 00:00:39.180
 this delay is so we will present this 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:41.580
 little xelor and then we'll do we go 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.920
 make a putsch on hot potato 

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:48.049
 so here firstly will start with the 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:50.040
 stuff that is very very very simple but 

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:51.559
 for me what I look so already 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:56.610
 to show us no news scratched himself 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:59.970
 its characteristics grivel 63.8 via 4 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.699
 pm 1251 pv 730 says there is no 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:03.750
 prospecting 3 havok 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:04.920
 when you see my wisdom is not 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.110
 very hot so I explain to you 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.360
 why because I'm waiting for 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.640
 rostov and the west at the bottom of the box 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.320
 I expect it is beautiful without this 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.750
 so that's why they're not good stuff 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.160
 not pushing the whole thing but it 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.140
 anyway g12 up watts that me 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:21.330
 gives 60 wisdom and since the 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.860
 day it became rare at the parceum that 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.600
 people so we get this makes me a 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.210
 great advantage and I still arrive at 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.140
 good role so here I have 522 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.200
 of intelligence because I always 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.490
 done and I do not go wrong even with 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.950
 even with little intelligence 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:40.700
 so here is the passage I am by shaw 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:40.700
 25 his young mistress to 25 

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:48.200
 thereafter the stuff so a doha 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.820
 dark brave so why 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.700
 already because it gives intel and 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:53.560
 of wisdom oil so that asks 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.060
 the people 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:58.340
 let's fight kings I had 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.890
 not I put before me the grid 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:03.110
 gave you wisdom my legs and 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:05.420
 I prefer to have some vita and more 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:07.720
 of intelligence what vincent jay is 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:12.260
 not change much 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:16.910
 the club lookea hot bird and light the 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:21.280
 hooded back the golden dt orchids the 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:24.590
 cherry blocks the blocks turkey batch 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:27.470
 always osella suits us in France 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:29.030
 the light blue friend who is very good and 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:32.569
 the trophies dofus of objects of dofus 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:34.340
 annoying kawata group 10h miners for 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:36.230
 three retirees to the sahara to the miners 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:38.120
 the initiators mining the service 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:41.180
 ordinary and the minor paralyzing that 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:43.250
 makes very scary syrups 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:45.500
 so that's what makes me a total 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:47.960
 500 calls and 2 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:56.840
 152 wisdom and retirees I think 

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:57.380
 that we have about twenty here retirees has 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:02.270
 24 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:05.320
 good is not bad and so 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:09.470
 bassam does it's not bad but 

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:12.520
 it's not bad and so we will spend everything 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:15.620
 immediately to the putsch that there is more 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:18.380
 unfortunately we will strive and if you 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:20.270
 hear tac tac tac tac tac good the 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:23.650
 neighbor who has been doing this for six months they 

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:23.650
 close too much before the diaper 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:36.480
 I can not show you the role but 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.500
 it's not very important 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:42.010
 so I'm done so I want to show 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:45.310
 what I rocks so there is still 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:47.920
 worst enemy its censorship I think that's the 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:51.849
 radius of Kurds of which I am of the 172 know 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:55.180
 no it's not disgusting 5 0 is not 

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:58.440
 does too much for oxz and but hey I'm coming 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:05.319
 to rome anyway sand and xella 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:09.549
 writings of 71 the ewer that makes 121 

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:17.310
 and then that's all there's not enough 

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:22.950
 temporal dust 90 the little flamiche 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:22.950
 good 15 and lightning 

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:28.479
 So that's 115 

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:30.340
 so yeah good it's a little character 

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:32.979
 like that I'm waiting to mount the buzz 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:35.950
 meaning since I am enormously fast because 

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:38.400
 I make your key 3g experts enormously 

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:40.180
 quickly so well, that's it 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:42.039
 I will wait for years, I will be 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:44.620
 maybe even a presentation to 

00:04:42.039 --> 00:04:46.000
 montluel meaning but it was just for 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:48.039
 introduce my new character to whom 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.430
 I might have colosseum videos 

00:04:48.039 --> 00:04:55.530
 years later that's all that 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:55.530
 I had to say in usual combat 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:02.630
 that's where maybe level 80 would change 

00:05:00.759 --> 00:05:04.849
 because basically I wanted to take a 

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:07.370
 stuff crowd wisdom and pv but there in 

00:05:04.849 --> 00:05:13.039
 had no good besides enormously expensive 

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:14.090
 but I was not very good so that's it 

00:05:13.039 --> 00:05:15.740
 that's all for this video of 

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:17.840
 presentation of weighing their lights level 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:19.430

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:20.539
