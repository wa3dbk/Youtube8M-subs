occipital Isana side of the skull we

00:00:40.519 --> 00:00:42.160 
occipital Isana side of the skull we
have<00:00:40.730> the<00:00:40.940> large<00:00:41.329> muscle<00:00:41.809> that's<00:00:41.960> going<00:00:42.109> to

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:42.170 
have the large muscle that's going to

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:44.470 
have the large muscle that's going to
allow<00:00:42.440> us<00:00:42.589> to<00:00:42.620> chew<00:00:43.129> run<00:00:43.640> straight<00:00:44.120> up<00:00:44.179> and

that's<00:00:46.489> the<00:00:46.730> masseter<00:00:47.390> muscle<00:00:48.379> and<00:00:48.620> if<00:00:48.769> we

00:00:48.849 --> 00:00:48.859 
that's the masseter muscle and if we

00:00:48.859 --> 00:00:51.220 
that's the masseter muscle and if we
look<00:00:49.010> at<00:00:49.129> the<00:00:49.219> front<00:00:49.519> we've<00:00:49.969> got<00:00:49.999> two<00:00:50.420> ring<00:00:50.809> or
