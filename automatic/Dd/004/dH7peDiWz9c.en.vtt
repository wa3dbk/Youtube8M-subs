00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
they'll find success even if the

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.499 
they'll find success even if the
audience<00:01:34.590> for<00:01:34.950> that<00:01:34.979> isn't<00:01:35.939> the<00:01:36.299> largest

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
audience for that isn't the largest

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:37.819 
audience for that isn't the largest
compared<00:01:37.140> to<00:01:37.259> something<00:01:37.439> else

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
compared to something else

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.249 
compared to something else
okay<00:01:38.729> so<00:01:38.790> naturally<00:01:39.420> you<00:01:39.540> saw<00:01:39.780> what<00:01:39.960> he<00:01:40.020> had<00:01:40.140> to

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
okay so naturally you saw what he had to

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.560 
okay so naturally you saw what he had to
say<00:01:40.290> there<00:01:40.770> and<00:01:41.040> basically<00:01:41.310> what<00:01:41.759> I<00:01:41.790> took<00:01:42.000> from

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
say there and basically what I took from

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.630 
say there and basically what I took from
that<00:01:42.750> snippet<00:01:43.259> there<00:01:43.470> that<00:01:44.130> he<00:01:44.310> was<00:01:44.460> saying

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
that snippet there that he was saying

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.429 
that snippet there that he was saying
you<00:01:44.729> guys<00:01:44.939> can<00:01:45.210> stay<00:01:45.420> there<00:01:45.750> and<00:01:46.020> we're<00:01:46.320> just

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
you guys can stay there and we're just

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.010 
you guys can stay there and we're just
gonna<00:01:46.649> stay<00:01:46.860> over<00:01:47.130> here<00:01:47.520> and<00:01:47.670> do<00:01:48.479> what<00:01:48.780> we<00:01:48.990> want

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
gonna stay over here and do what we want

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.219 
gonna stay over here and do what we want
to<00:01:49.320> do<00:01:49.520> when<00:01:50.520> I<00:01:50.549> took<00:01:50.640> from<00:01:50.909> that<00:01:51.180> was<00:01:51.750> that<00:01:51.990> it

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
to do when I took from that was that it

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.200 
to do when I took from that was that it
doesn't<00:01:52.619> seem<00:01:52.770> like<00:01:52.920> Bethesda<00:01:53.430> likes<00:01:53.729> to<00:01:53.939> go

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
doesn't seem like Bethesda likes to go

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.920 
doesn't seem like Bethesda likes to go
back<00:01:54.509> and<00:01:55.280> rework<00:01:56.280> new<00:01:56.759> stuff<00:01:57.119> and<00:01:57.329> put<00:01:57.630> it<00:01:57.659> on

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
back and rework new stuff and put it on

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.810 
back and rework new stuff and put it on
new<00:01:58.350> systems<00:01:58.770> now<00:01:58.920> that's<00:01:59.189> not<00:01:59.310> exactly<00:01:59.670> what

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
Skyrim or moorland and um I think that's

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:42.080 
Skyrim or moorland and um I think that's
why<00:02:40.230> going<00:02:40.560> back<00:02:40.830> and<00:02:41.010> remastering<00:02:41.670> it<00:02:41.880> it

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
why going back and remastering it it

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:43.850 
why going back and remastering it it
kind<00:02:42.570> of<00:02:42.630> seems<00:02:42.870> pointless<00:02:43.170> in<00:02:43.440> that<00:02:43.560> regard

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
kind of seems pointless in that regard

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.290 
kind of seems pointless in that regard
another<00:02:44.520> thing<00:02:44.760> that<00:02:44.880> kind<00:02:45.030> of<00:02:45.150> seems

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
another thing that kind of seems

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:46.910 
another thing that kind of seems
pointless<00:02:45.570> about<00:02:45.930> remastering<00:02:46.470> fallout<00:02:46.740> 3

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
pointless about remastering fallout 3

pointless about remastering fallout 3

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
now on these new systems we could put

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:22.850 
now on these new systems we could put
double<00:03:21.300> amount<00:03:21.510> of<00:03:21.660> enemies<00:03:21.989> like<00:03:22.230> it<00:03:22.350> doesn't

double amount of enemies like it doesn't

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:24.440 
double amount of enemies like it doesn't
seem<00:03:23.040> to<00:03:23.130> make<00:03:23.250> sense<00:03:23.310> they're<00:03:23.730> the<00:03:24.300> only

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739 
thing I could see happening is maybe

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:28.040 
thing I could see happening is maybe
less<00:03:26.070> crashing<00:03:26.760> but<00:03:27.300> all<00:03:27.480> right<00:03:27.690> now<00:03:27.840> I<00:03:27.870> don't

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:28.050

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:32.850 
worth considering is that from that

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:34.580 
worth considering is that from that
little<00:03:33.090> snippet<00:03:33.300> there<00:03:33.630> he<00:03:34.230> didn't<00:03:34.440> seem<00:03:34.560> very

sales focus they just want to create

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
something new and memorable so if they

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:40.400 
something new and memorable so if they
wanted<00:03:38.940> to<00:03:39.000> make<00:03:39.120> sales<00:03:39.390> then<00:03:39.900> why<00:03:40.140> wouldn't

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
wanted to make sales then why wouldn't

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:41.960 
wanted to make sales then why wouldn't
they<00:03:40.530> go<00:03:40.680> back<00:03:40.860> and<00:03:41.010> remaster<00:03:41.489> those<00:03:41.580> games<00:03:41.790> am

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
they go back and remaster those games am

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.960 
they go back and remaster those games am
I<00:03:42.060> correct<00:03:42.270> or<00:03:42.480> no<00:03:42.630> um<00:03:42.930> but<00:03:43.530> on<00:03:44.520> the<00:03:44.700> other<00:03:44.850> hand

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
I correct or no um but on the other hand

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:48.560 
I correct or no um but on the other hand
if<00:03:45.739> they<00:03:46.739> did<00:03:47.010> do<00:03:47.310> a<00:03:47.550> remaster<00:03:48.239> version

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:48.570 
if they did do a remaster version

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:50.060 
if they did do a remaster version
obviously<00:03:48.720> it<00:03:49.050> would<00:03:49.140> come<00:03:49.290> out<00:03:49.320> before<00:03:49.620> their

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:50.070 
obviously it would come out before their

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:52.100 
obviously it would come out before their
next<00:03:50.250> new<00:03:50.489> game<00:03:50.730> which<00:03:51.270> would<00:03:51.450> most<00:03:51.690> likely<00:03:51.870> be

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:52.110 
next new game which would most likely be

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:54.050 
next new game which would most likely be
fallout<00:03:52.410> because<00:03:52.739> it<00:03:53.340> would<00:03:53.489> make<00:03:53.640> sense<00:03:53.910> you

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
fallout because it would make sense you

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:55.550 
fallout because it would make sense you
know<00:03:54.180> once<00:03:54.660> again<00:03:54.780> going<00:03:55.050> back<00:03:55.170> to<00:03:55.290> Tomb

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
know once again going back to Tomb

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.170 
know once again going back to Tomb
Raider<00:03:55.620> they<00:03:56.459> did<00:03:56.670> the<00:03:56.760> first<00:03:56.910> Tomb<00:03:57.120> Raider

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
Raider they did the first Tomb Raider

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:58.850 
Raider they did the first Tomb Raider
that<00:03:57.540> they<00:03:57.630> did<00:03:57.810> the<00:03:57.900> definitive<00:03:58.140> edition<00:03:58.380> and

00:03:58.850 --> 00:03:58.860 
that they did the definitive edition and

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:00.350 
that they did the definitive edition and
a<00:03:58.980> little<00:03:59.520> bit<00:03:59.640> like<00:03:59.820> few<00:04:00.000> months<00:04:00.180> down<00:04:00.300> the

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:00.360 
a little bit like few months down the

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:02.330 
a little bit like few months down the
line<00:04:00.510> the<00:04:01.140> new<00:04:01.410> tomb<00:04:01.650> raider<00:04:01.860> rise<00:04:02.130> of<00:04:02.280> the

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
line the new tomb raider rise of the

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:04.970 
line the new tomb raider rise of the
Tomb<00:04:02.520> Raider<00:04:02.580> was<00:04:03.000> announced<00:04:03.570> at<00:04:03.660> e3<00:04:03.810> so<00:04:04.680> it

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
Tomb Raider was announced at e3 so it

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:06.890 
Tomb Raider was announced at e3 so it
kind<00:04:05.250> of<00:04:05.310> makes<00:04:05.550> sense<00:04:05.640> that<00:04:06.120> the<00:04:06.480> cat<00:04:06.660> was<00:04:06.810> out

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 
kind of makes sense that the cat was out

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.570 
kind of makes sense that the cat was out
of<00:04:06.989> the<00:04:07.050> bag<00:04:07.260> we<00:04:07.440> already<00:04:07.680> knew<00:04:07.800> a<00:04:07.830> new<00:04:08.100> tomb

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:08.580 
of the bag we already knew a new tomb

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:09.920 
of the bag we already knew a new tomb
raider<00:04:08.790> was<00:04:08.910> coming<00:04:09.209> regardless<00:04:09.720> but

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.930 
raider was coming regardless but

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:13.460 
raider was coming regardless but
nonetheless<00:04:10.830> um<00:04:11.400> you<00:04:12.330> know<00:04:12.420> if<00:04:12.660> Bethesda<00:04:13.350> were

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
nonetheless um you know if Bethesda were

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:15.259 
nonetheless um you know if Bethesda were
to<00:04:13.620> do<00:04:13.769> that<00:04:13.950> I<00:04:14.220> would<00:04:14.400> figure<00:04:14.730> that<00:04:15.090> if<00:04:15.209> they

00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:15.269 
to do that I would figure that if they

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:16.400 
to do that I would figure that if they
were<00:04:15.360> trying<00:04:15.480> to<00:04:15.570> keep<00:04:15.690> this<00:04:15.810> announcement<00:04:16.169> so

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:16.410 
were trying to keep this announcement so

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:18.140 
were trying to keep this announcement so
secret<00:04:16.799> this<00:04:17.160> would<00:04:17.310> undo<00:04:17.609> everything<00:04:17.910> if

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 
secret this would undo everything if

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:19.940 
secret this would undo everything if
they<00:04:18.239> remastered<00:04:18.870> fallout<00:04:19.140> 3<00:04:19.350> new<00:04:19.530> Vegas<00:04:19.799> I'd

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:19.950 
they remastered fallout 3 new Vegas I'd

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:21.590 
they remastered fallout 3 new Vegas I'd
just<00:04:20.070> be<00:04:20.190> like<00:04:20.220> ok<00:04:20.609> so<00:04:20.669> your<00:04:21.000> next<00:04:21.210> game<00:04:21.359> is<00:04:21.570> a

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:21.600 
just be like ok so your next game is a

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.360 
just be like ok so your next game is a
fall<00:04:21.900> game<00:04:22.109> obviously<00:04:22.410> why<00:04:22.950> the<00:04:23.010> hell<00:04:23.280> would

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.370 
fall game obviously why the hell would

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:24.390 
fall game obviously why the hell would
you<00:04:23.400> be<00:04:23.580> remastering<00:04:24.060> these

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:24.400 
you be remastering these

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:25.890 
you be remastering these
or<00:04:24.699> at<00:04:25.060> least<00:04:25.120> I<00:04:25.360> would<00:04:25.419> make<00:04:25.600> the<00:04:25.690> most<00:04:25.810> sense

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:25.900 
or at least I would make the most sense

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:27.719 
or at least I would make the most sense
it<00:04:26.139> does<00:04:26.259> mean<00:04:26.410> they<00:04:26.530> have<00:04:26.770> to<00:04:26.949> necessarily

00:04:27.719 --> 00:04:27.729 
it does mean they have to necessarily

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:29.129 
it does mean they have to necessarily
but<00:04:28.180> it<00:04:28.419> would<00:04:28.509> just<00:04:28.660> makes<00:04:28.810> the<00:04:28.900> most<00:04:29.050> sense

00:04:29.129 --> 00:04:29.139 
but it would just makes the most sense

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:30.689 
but it would just makes the most sense
it<00:04:29.680> would<00:04:29.770> get<00:04:29.860> a<00:04:29.919> lot<00:04:30.040> of<00:04:30.130> people<00:04:30.340> caught<00:04:30.550> up

00:04:30.689 --> 00:04:30.699 
it would get a lot of people caught up

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:33.930 
it would get a lot of people caught up
in<00:04:30.820> those<00:04:31.000> games<00:04:31.240> and<00:04:31.570> um<00:04:32.229> yeah<00:04:32.680> but<00:04:32.979> those<00:04:33.820> the

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:33.940 
in those games and um yeah but those the

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:35.580 
in those games and um yeah but those the
only<00:04:34.030> reasons<00:04:34.419> I<00:04:34.479> can<00:04:34.600> think<00:04:34.630> of<00:04:34.840> why<00:04:35.080> not<00:04:35.350> to

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:35.590 
only reasons I can think of why not to

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:37.350 
only reasons I can think of why not to
the<00:04:35.800> reason<00:04:36.250> is<00:04:36.310> why<00:04:36.520> they<00:04:36.729> should<00:04:36.940> are<00:04:37.150> very

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:37.360 
the reason is why they should are very

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:39.270 
the reason is why they should are very
obvious<00:04:37.870> it's<00:04:38.020> a<00:04:38.080> very<00:04:38.289> hungry<00:04:38.560> fanbase<00:04:39.100> they

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:39.280 
obvious it's a very hungry fanbase they

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:40.920 
obvious it's a very hungry fanbase they
want<00:04:39.490> to<00:04:39.550> play<00:04:39.699> fault<00:04:40.000> again<00:04:40.270> in<00:04:40.389> a<00:04:40.479> new<00:04:40.690> way

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:40.930 
want to play fault again in a new way

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:44.189 
want to play fault again in a new way
and<00:04:41.229> it's<00:04:42.070> just<00:04:42.340> like<00:04:42.490> with<00:04:42.639> me<00:04:42.820> I<00:04:42.850> used<00:04:43.210> to<00:04:43.389> buy

00:04:44.189 --> 00:04:44.199 
and it's just like with me I used to buy

00:04:44.199 --> 00:04:46.320 
and it's just like with me I used to buy
a<00:04:44.229> game<00:04:44.530> for<00:04:44.710> the<00:04:44.770> 360<00:04:45.370> and<00:04:45.639> then<00:04:45.820> later<00:04:46.210> on

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:46.330 
a game for the 360 and then later on

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:48.180 
a game for the 360 and then later on
down<00:04:46.479> the<00:04:46.810> line<00:04:46.960> like<00:04:47.169> about<00:04:47.350> a<00:04:47.380> year<00:04:47.650> buy<00:04:48.130> it

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:48.190 
down the line like about a year buy it

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:49.230 
down the line like about a year buy it
again<00:04:48.340> for<00:04:48.610> the<00:04:48.669> ps3

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:49.240 
again for the ps3

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:50.670 
again for the ps3
try<00:04:49.509> to<00:04:49.570> go<00:04:49.690> for<00:04:49.840> the<00:04:49.900> trophies<00:04:50.229> on<00:04:50.350> that<00:04:50.500> just

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:50.680 
try to go for the trophies on that just

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:52.110 
try to go for the trophies on that just
because<00:04:50.860> on<00:04:51.009> a<00:04:51.039> new<00:04:51.250> system<00:04:51.639> it<00:04:51.759> just<00:04:51.789> feels

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:52.120 
because on a new system it just feels

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:53.340 
because on a new system it just feels
like<00:04:52.270> it's<00:04:52.419> the<00:04:52.509> same<00:04:52.690> game<00:04:52.900> but<00:04:53.080> it's<00:04:53.169> just<00:04:53.229> a

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:53.350 
like it's the same game but it's just a

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:54.900 
like it's the same game but it's just a
new<00:04:53.500> experience<00:04:53.530> cuz<00:04:54.070> you're<00:04:54.460> going<00:04:54.729> for<00:04:54.880> the

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:54.910 
new experience cuz you're going for the

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:57.180 
new experience cuz you're going for the
same<00:04:55.150> stuff<00:04:55.509> just<00:04:55.960> differently<00:04:56.830> I<00:04:56.860> don't<00:04:57.130> know

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:57.190 
same stuff just differently I don't know

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:58.560 
same stuff just differently I don't know
how<00:04:57.310> to<00:04:57.370> explain<00:04:57.699> it<00:04:57.910> or<00:04:58.030> like<00:04:58.240> you're<00:04:58.360> going

00:04:58.560 --> 00:04:58.570 
how to explain it or like you're going

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:00.420 
how to explain it or like you're going
in<00:04:58.660> there<00:04:58.780> with<00:04:58.900> premeditated<00:04:59.800> knowledge<00:05:00.220> so

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:00.430 
in there with premeditated knowledge so

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:01.860 
in there with premeditated knowledge so
it's<00:05:00.940> just<00:05:01.120> different<00:05:01.419> I<00:05:01.690> don't<00:05:01.750> know

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:01.870 
it's just different I don't know

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:03.810 
it's just different I don't know
something<00:05:02.199> about<00:05:02.410> it<00:05:02.560> but<00:05:02.979> like<00:05:03.430> I<00:05:03.550> said<00:05:03.610> the

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:03.820 
something about it but like I said the

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:05.820 
something about it but like I said the
obvious<00:05:04.240> the<00:05:04.479> reasons<00:05:04.840> that<00:05:04.990> they<00:05:05.440> should<00:05:05.680> do

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:05.830 
obvious the reasons that they should do

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:07.770 
obvious the reasons that they should do
it<00:05:05.949> are<00:05:06.190> obvious<00:05:06.760> and<00:05:06.940> I<00:05:07.360> shouldn't<00:05:07.630> really

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:07.780 
it are obvious and I shouldn't really

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:10.080 
it are obvious and I shouldn't really
have<00:05:08.020> to<00:05:08.169> explain<00:05:08.530> them<00:05:08.710> um<00:05:09.250> the<00:05:09.550> two<00:05:09.789> basic

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:10.090 
have to explain them um the two basic

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:12.180 
have to explain them um the two basic
ones<00:05:10.270> are<00:05:10.389> right<00:05:10.510> there<00:05:10.780> but<00:05:11.410> yeah<00:05:11.949> I<00:05:11.979> just

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:12.190 
ones are right there but yeah I just

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:13.320 
ones are right there but yeah I just
want<00:05:12.490> to<00:05:12.550> go<00:05:12.639> ahead<00:05:12.760> and<00:05:12.850> discuss<00:05:13.150> that

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:13.330 
want to go ahead and discuss that

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:14.670 
want to go ahead and discuss that
because<00:05:13.570> I<00:05:13.600> look<00:05:13.990> back<00:05:14.169> I'm<00:05:14.320> like<00:05:14.410> have<00:05:14.650> I

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:14.680 
because I look back I'm like have I

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:16.409 
because I look back I'm like have I
really<00:05:15.130> not<00:05:15.310> talked<00:05:15.610> about<00:05:15.729> this<00:05:16.000> before

00:05:16.409 --> 00:05:16.419 
really not talked about this before

00:05:16.419 --> 00:05:18.330 
really not talked about this before
because<00:05:16.570> you<00:05:16.990> know<00:05:17.349> people<00:05:17.650> ask<00:05:17.770> me<00:05:17.919> all<00:05:18.190> the

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:18.340 
because you know people ask me all the

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:20.460 
because you know people ask me all the
time<00:05:18.550> about<00:05:18.580> it<00:05:18.970> why<00:05:19.449> why<00:05:19.930> is<00:05:19.990> in<00:05:20.169> fallout<00:05:20.440> 3

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:20.470 
time about it why why is in fallout 3

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:22.830 
time about it why why is in fallout 3
new<00:05:20.800> vegas<00:05:21.070> remastered<00:05:21.669> and<00:05:21.880> it<00:05:22.509> just<00:05:22.690> seems

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:22.840 
new vegas remastered and it just seems

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:24.180 
new vegas remastered and it just seems
kind<00:05:23.020> of<00:05:23.050> pointless<00:05:23.229> i<00:05:23.500> guess<00:05:23.650> see<00:05:23.770> skyrim

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:24.190 
kind of pointless i guess see skyrim

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:25.230 
kind of pointless i guess see skyrim
being<00:05:24.490> one<00:05:24.639> of<00:05:24.669> those<00:05:24.789> games<00:05:25.030> being

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:25.240 
being one of those games being

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:27.749 
being one of those games being
remastered<00:05:25.900> for<00:05:26.080> new<00:05:26.199> systems<00:05:26.440> but<00:05:27.160> even<00:05:27.550> that

00:05:27.749 --> 00:05:27.759 
remastered for new systems but even that

00:05:27.759 --> 00:05:29.159 
remastered for new systems but even that
I<00:05:27.940> don't<00:05:28.120> see<00:05:28.270> I<00:05:28.300> don't<00:05:28.630> think<00:05:28.780> that<00:05:28.900> does<00:05:29.020> this

00:05:29.159 --> 00:05:29.169 
I don't see I don't think that does this

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:31.379 
I don't see I don't think that does this
going<00:05:29.320> to<00:05:29.410> do<00:05:29.560> that<00:05:29.770> that<00:05:30.550> would<00:05:30.610> just<00:05:30.669> be<00:05:30.910> even

00:05:31.379 --> 00:05:31.389 
going to do that that would just be even

00:05:31.389 --> 00:05:32.939 
going to do that that would just be even
that<00:05:31.539> would<00:05:31.720> be<00:05:31.750> way<00:05:31.990> too<00:05:32.050> much<00:05:32.320> Elder<00:05:32.650> Scrolls

00:05:32.939 --> 00:05:32.949 
that would be way too much Elder Scrolls

00:05:32.949 --> 00:05:34.409 
that would be way too much Elder Scrolls
because<00:05:33.160> then<00:05:33.340> you'd<00:05:33.460> be<00:05:33.520> repeating<00:05:34.210> one<00:05:34.300> of

00:05:34.409 --> 00:05:34.419 
because then you'd be repeating one of

00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:36.120 
because then you'd be repeating one of
your<00:05:34.510> games<00:05:34.720> and<00:05:34.930> I<00:05:35.410> don't<00:05:35.530> think<00:05:35.860> it<00:05:35.919> takes

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:36.130 
your games and I don't think it takes

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:37.920 
your games and I don't think it takes
three<00:05:36.460> years<00:05:36.490> to<00:05:36.940> remaster<00:05:37.240> a<00:05:37.449> game<00:05:37.630> for<00:05:37.840> new

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:37.930 
three years to remaster a game for new

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:41.070 
three years to remaster a game for new
consoles<00:05:38.440> but<00:05:39.010> that's<00:05:39.370> just<00:05:39.699> me<00:05:40.000> I'd<00:05:40.750> love<00:05:40.930> to
