here<00:02:03.810> that<00:02:04.079> comes<00:02:04.320> out<00:02:04.500> I<00:02:04.530> there's<00:02:05.130> a<00:02:05.189> couple

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
here that comes out I there's a couple

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.760 
here that comes out I there's a couple
there's<00:02:05.549> like<00:02:05.640> a<00:02:05.670> white<00:02:05.969> piece<00:02:06.390> that<00:02:06.689> is<00:02:07.680> a

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
there's like a white piece that is a

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.529 
there's like a white piece that is a
circle<00:02:08.340> with<00:02:08.369> a<00:02:08.550> little<00:02:08.789> thing<00:02:09.060> on<00:02:09.239> it<00:02:09.360> that's

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
circle with a little thing on it that's

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.119 
circle with a little thing on it that's
in<00:02:09.690> there<00:02:09.869> so<00:02:10.110> but<00:02:10.349> anyway<00:02:10.560> I<00:02:10.590> guess<00:02:10.860> I'll<00:02:11.009> just

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
in there so but anyway I guess I'll just

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:12.690 
in there so but anyway I guess I'll just
replace<00:02:11.400> the<00:02:11.760> entire<00:02:12.060> thing

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
replace the entire thing

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:17.270 
replace the entire thing
so<00:02:14.340> that'll<00:02:15.340> be<00:02:15.400> that

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
so that'll be that

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.680 
so that'll be that
and<00:02:18.280> then<00:02:18.459> actually<00:02:18.760> I<00:02:18.790> think<00:02:18.880> this<00:02:19.150> is<00:02:19.450> black

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
and then actually I think this is black

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:21.720 
and then actually I think this is black
trim<00:02:20.080> color<00:02:20.350> thing<00:02:20.650> this<00:02:20.920> this<00:02:21.220> the<00:02:21.490> actual

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
trim color thing this this the actual

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.270 
trim color thing this this the actual
handle<00:02:22.209> itself<00:02:22.569> stays<00:02:23.530> on<00:02:23.800> the<00:02:23.920> car<00:02:24.100> that

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
handle itself stays on the car that

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.460 
handle itself stays on the car that
doesn't<00:02:25.120> get<00:02:25.390> replaced<00:02:25.750> but<00:02:25.900> everything<00:02:26.319> else

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
doesn't get replaced but everything else

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:28.050 
doesn't get replaced but everything else

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
like the inside the lock gets replaced

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.480 
like the inside the lock gets replaced
and<00:02:28.450> everything<00:02:28.750> else<00:02:28.870> so<00:02:29.470> the<00:02:29.709> club<00:02:29.980> box<00:02:30.250> what

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:29.640 
needs to be clean but you talk about
something<00:03:27.910> that's<00:03:28.000> organized<00:03:28.570> look<00:03:29.380> at<00:03:29.470> that

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:29.650 
something that's organized look at that

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:35.280 
something that's organized look at that
and<00:03:32.070> you<00:03:33.070> know<00:03:33.190> it<00:03:33.370> tells<00:03:33.850> you<00:03:34.060> what<00:03:35.019> kind<00:03:35.260> of

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
and you know it tells you what kind of

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:37.229 
and you know it tells you what kind of
equipment<00:03:35.560> you<00:03:36.070> know<00:03:36.190> you<00:03:36.280> got<00:03:36.430> going<00:03:36.730> on<00:03:36.820> and

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:37.239 
equipment you know you got going on and

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:41.610 
equipment you know you got going on and
what<00:03:39.269> doesn't<00:03:40.269> focus<00:03:40.450> so<00:03:40.630> well<00:03:40.959> I<00:03:41.170> guess<00:03:41.440> I'm

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:41.620 
what doesn't focus so well I guess I'm

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:43.319 
what doesn't focus so well I guess I'm
at<00:03:41.799> low<00:03:41.950> definition<00:03:42.459> or<00:03:42.549> something<00:03:42.760> but<00:03:43.209> only

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:43.329 
at low definition or something but only

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:44.819 
at low definition or something but only
said<00:03:43.480> that<00:03:43.570> car's<00:03:43.780> got<00:03:43.870> all<00:03:44.170> kind<00:03:44.650> of

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:44.829 
said that car's got all kind of

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:47.069 
said that car's got all kind of
information<00:03:45.040> about<00:03:45.790> which<00:03:46.209> fuse<00:03:46.570> is<00:03:46.810> broken

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:47.079 
information about which fuse is broken

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:51.240 
information about which fuse is broken
so<00:03:47.380> now<00:03:47.560> I<00:03:48.000> don't<00:03:49.000> know<00:03:49.360> if<00:03:49.540> I<00:03:49.720> told<00:03:49.959> you<00:03:50.250> the

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:51.250 
so now I don't know if I told you the

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:54.800 
so now I don't know if I told you the
the<00:03:51.850> entire<00:03:52.570> taking<00:03:53.019> the<00:03:53.140> lights<00:03:53.350> apart<00:03:53.860> thing

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
the entire taking the lights apart thing

00:03:54.810 --> 00:04:00.090 
the entire taking the lights apart thing
I<00:03:55.810> found<00:03:56.709> out<00:03:57.040> that<00:03:57.370> that<00:03:58.739> it's<00:03:59.739> none<00:03:59.890> of<00:04:00.010> the

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:00.100 
I found out that that it's none of the

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:02.940 
I found out that that it's none of the
parts<00:04:00.459> and<00:04:00.850> in<00:04:01.420> the<00:04:01.540> light<00:04:01.750> area<00:04:02.170> it's<00:04:02.590> one<00:04:02.860> of

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:02.950 
parts and in the light area it's one of

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:06.330 
parts and in the light area it's one of
these<00:04:03.040> fuses<00:04:03.670> uh<00:04:04.410> so<00:04:05.410> I<00:04:05.440> got<00:04:05.739> to<00:04:05.829> just<00:04:05.980> find<00:04:06.220> the

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:06.340 
these fuses uh so I got to just find the

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:07.319 
these fuses uh so I got to just find the
fuse<00:04:06.579> and<00:04:06.730> replace<00:04:07.030> it

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:07.329 
fuse and replace it

00:04:07.329 --> 00:04:08.849 
fuse and replace it
but<00:04:07.660> I'm<00:04:07.780> really<00:04:07.989> glad<00:04:08.200> I<00:04:08.320> took<00:04:08.440> the<00:04:08.680> lights

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:08.859

00:04:08.859 --> 00:04:12.090 
but I'm really glad I took the lights
apart<00:04:09.280> and<00:04:09.549> and<00:04:10.390> I'm<00:04:10.870> gonna<00:04:11.410> polish<00:04:11.709> them

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:12.100 
apart and and I'm gonna polish them

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:13.920 
apart and and I'm gonna polish them
later<00:04:12.459> and<00:04:12.760> so<00:04:12.910> that'll<00:04:13.180> be<00:04:13.269> nice<00:04:13.390> and<00:04:13.720> I<00:04:13.780> have

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:13.930 
later and so that'll be nice and I have

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:16.800 
later and so that'll be nice and I have
brighter<00:04:14.260> bulbs<00:04:14.709> and<00:04:14.920> so<00:04:15.390> anyway<00:04:16.390> oh<00:04:16.419> there's

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:16.810 
brighter bulbs and so anyway oh there's

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:18.930 
brighter bulbs and so anyway oh there's
the<00:04:16.989> fuses<00:04:17.350> and<00:04:17.500> then<00:04:18.070> when<00:04:18.160> you<00:04:18.250> go<00:04:18.370> to<00:04:18.400> up<00:04:18.760> it

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:18.940 
the fuses and then when you go to up it

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:21.270 
the fuses and then when you go to up it
away<00:04:19.120> you<00:04:19.479> do<00:04:20.350> this<00:04:20.530> and<00:04:20.739> you'll<00:04:20.950> just<00:04:21.039> push

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:21.280 
away you do this and you'll just push

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:23.279 
away you do this and you'll just push
these<00:04:21.459> white<00:04:21.820> things<00:04:22.090> right<00:04:22.330> somehow<00:04:22.930> back<00:04:23.169> to

00:04:23.279 --> 00:04:23.289 
these white things right somehow back to

00:04:23.289 --> 00:04:24.600 
these white things right somehow back to
where<00:04:23.410> they<00:04:23.500> went

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:24.610 
where they went

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:26.939 
where they went
there<00:04:25.389> it<00:04:25.479> was<00:04:25.569> and<00:04:25.990> then<00:04:26.379> they<00:04:26.500> kind<00:04:26.680> of<00:04:26.710> go<00:04:26.800> to

00:04:26.939 --> 00:04:26.949 
there it was and then they kind of go to

00:04:26.949 --> 00:04:29.510 
there it was and then they kind of go to
the<00:04:26.979> inside<00:04:27.430> I<00:04:27.460> guess

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520 
the inside I guess

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:33.689 
the inside I guess
