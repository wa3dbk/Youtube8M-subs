00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:04.540
 This video shows you how 

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:07.120
 replace a print cartridge in your HP printer. 

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:09.260
 Let's go over the steps together. 

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:12.000
 The first thing to do is to turn on the printer, 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.940
 so press the on / off button. 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:17.200
 Then open the access door. 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:26.180
 Wait until the trolley stops. Thereafter 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:28.230
 find the print cartridge that you want to replace 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.000
 and lift the ink cartridge cover to release it. 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.430
 Lift the print cartridge to remove it from the slot. 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.420
 Now remove the new ink cartridge from the package. 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:51.500
 Pull on the pink tab 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.210
 to remove the plastic tape from the new print cartridge. 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:59.210
 When handling the ink cartridges, pay attention to 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:02.580
 the electrical contacts and the ink nozzles. 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:05.580
 Be careful not to touch these contact points and ink nozzles 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.260
 because this can cause clogging, lack of ink 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.500
 and poor electrical connections. 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.380
 Be sure to reinsert the print cartridges in the correct slots. 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:19.190
 Tri-color on the left and Black on the right. 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:21.550
 Hold the print cartridge by the sides 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:24.120
 with the contacts facing the back of the printer, 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.500
 and slide it directly into the released slot. 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.120
 Close the ink cartridge door to secure the cartridge. 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:36.420
 Repeat these steps to replace the other ink cartridge if necessary. 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:38.820
 If you have installed the ink cartridge, 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.220
 close the ink cartridge access door. 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.120
 If you need to load paper 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:48.820
 arrange the paper by tapping the stack on a flat surface. 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:52.500
 Then pull out the paper tray. 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.000
 Slide paper into the input tray until it stops. 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.630
 Slide the paper width guide in until 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:00.610
 it touches the paper edge. 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:02.580
 Do not push the guide so far 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:04.270
 that it starts to bend the paper. 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.190
 Slide the tray into the printer again. 

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:10.590
 After the ink cartridges are installed, 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.690
 the printer automatically prints a test page. 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.810
 When the test page has completely completed the print job 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.500
 you can use the printer normally again.
