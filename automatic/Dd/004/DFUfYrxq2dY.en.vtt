00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 hello everyone welcome to this new 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:07.020
 video as you see for the title today we are going 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.950
 to see how a corner is installed in 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.510
 this new soccer manager 

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:13.180
 The first thing we have to do is 

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:17.580
 download the skin in this case I have 

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:17.580
 chosen is the scorpio 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:22.730
 the truth is that 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:25.160
 it's quite pretty cool and 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:27.110
 you will see now how it is 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:30.010
 we are going to 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:30.010
 once downloaded 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:34.720
 we go to documents 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:37.579
 interactive 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:40.249
 in May 2015 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:42.909
 and we are going to skins and here what we are going to 

00:00:40.249 --> 00:00:42.909
 do is going to be 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:50.560
 these three folders are going to 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:54.320
 drag to the skins folder in 

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:58.120
 in football manager 2015 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:58.120
 Let's see if it happens 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.020
 well they are copying 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:18.230
 we close and close and now we are going to 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.180
 football manager 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:23.890
 once here what we have to do 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:23.890
 will go to preferences 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:32.920
 here 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:32.920
 go to preferences 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:39.070
 the appearance and select scorpio 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:42.840
 to interface 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:49.290
 let's give it to reload the appearance 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:02.190
 and once I finish this always 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:05.010
 this always happens but once 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:07.710
 that ends up loading even if it seems 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:11.179
 that does not work 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.179
 if it really works 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.250
 what is costing you too much 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.819
 if you like it now 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:43.250
 here it is 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:44.600
 this is the scorpion and well I hope that 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:46.670
 I liked it if you have any questions 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:49.930
 leave it in the box comments and we 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:49.930
 we see in the next video see you later
