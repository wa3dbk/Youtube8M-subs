big name for button synthesis scientists
Yan<00:00:07.500> ingen-housz<00:00:08.059> who<00:00:09.059> kind<00:00:09.750> of<00:00:09.809> followed<00:00:10.320> up

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
Yan ingen-housz who kind of followed up

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.700 
Yan ingen-housz who kind of followed up
on<00:00:10.620> Priestley's<00:00:11.160> experiments<00:00:12.000> and<00:00:12.440> he<00:00:13.440> added

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
on Priestley's experiments and he added

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.950 
on Priestley's experiments and he added
to<00:00:14.040> them<00:00:14.160> and<00:00:14.400> one<00:00:14.639> thing<00:00:14.849> he<00:00:15.000> noticed<00:00:15.389> was

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
to them and one thing he noticed was

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.029 
to them and one thing he noticed was
that<00:00:16.500> in<00:00:17.070> order<00:00:17.550> for<00:00:17.580> the<00:00:18.359> plants<00:00:19.020> to<00:00:19.439> actually

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
that in order for the plants to actually

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.120 
that in order for the plants to actually
fix<00:00:20.789> the<00:00:21.029> injured<00:00:21.510> air<00:00:21.750> they<00:00:22.260> had<00:00:22.500> to<00:00:22.710> be<00:00:22.890> in

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
fix the injured air they had to be in

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.929 
fix the injured air they had to be in
the<00:00:23.340> light<00:00:23.550> and<00:00:24.500> not<00:00:25.500> only<00:00:25.710> that<00:00:26.099> only<00:00:26.670> the

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
the light and not only that only the

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.210 
the light and not only that only the
green<00:00:27.240> parts<00:00:27.689> of<00:00:27.810> the<00:00:27.930> plants<00:00:28.380> would<00:00:28.619> actually

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
green parts of the plants would actually

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.189 
green parts of the plants would actually
fix<00:00:29.490> the<00:00:29.609> air<00:00:29.849> not<00:00:30.269> any<00:00:30.480> of<00:00:30.599> the<00:00:30.720> other<00:00:30.869> parts

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
fix the air not any of the other parts

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:32.540 
fix the air not any of the other parts
like<00:00:31.289> he<00:00:31.470> tried<00:00:31.710> it<00:00:31.800> with<00:00:31.920> the<00:00:32.009> roots<00:00:32.250> and

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
like he tried it with the roots and

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.220 
like he tried it with the roots and
parts<00:00:32.759> that<00:00:32.850> weren't<00:00:33.090> green<00:00:33.390> and<00:00:33.809> it<00:00:33.960> didn't

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
parts that weren't green and it didn't

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.010 
parts that weren't green and it didn't
work<00:00:34.640> but<00:00:35.640> if<00:00:35.790> he<00:00:35.910> went<00:00:36.120> further<00:00:36.390> and<00:00:36.690> he<00:00:36.809> set

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
work but if he went further and he set

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.479 
work but if he went further and he set
up<00:00:37.110> his<00:00:37.140> next<00:00:37.530> experiment<00:00:37.800> you<00:00:38.100> can<00:00:38.250> see<00:00:38.399> her

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
up his next experiment you can see her

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.290 
up his next experiment you can see her
there<00:00:38.670> where<00:00:39.300> he<00:00:39.660> used<00:00:39.989> water<00:00:40.379> plants<00:00:41.010> and<00:00:41.300> he

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
there where he used water plants and he

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.720 
there where he used water plants and he
put<00:00:42.540> them<00:00:42.719> under<00:00:43.170> a<00:00:43.200> funnel<00:00:43.829> so<00:00:44.040> that<00:00:44.309> he<00:00:44.520> can

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
put them under a funnel so that he can

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.610 
put them under a funnel so that he can
catch<00:00:45.000> any<00:00:45.390> gas<00:00:45.690> that<00:00:45.719> were<00:00:46.110> made<00:00:46.260> by<00:00:46.440> them

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
catch any gas that were made by them

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:47.690 
catch any gas that were made by them
because<00:00:46.770> he<00:00:46.890> noticed<00:00:47.039> that<00:00:47.309> when<00:00:47.399> you<00:00:47.430> put

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
because he noticed that when you put

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.310 
because he noticed that when you put
water<00:00:47.940> plants<00:00:48.420> in<00:00:48.510> the<00:00:48.600> light<00:00:48.780> they<00:00:49.079> produce

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
water plants in the light they produce

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.029 
water plants in the light they produce
bubbles<00:00:49.710> and<00:00:50.309> he<00:00:51.300> wanted<00:00:51.539> to<00:00:51.600> know<00:00:51.829> what<00:00:52.829> those

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
bubbles and he wanted to know what those

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.459 
bubbles and he wanted to know what those
bubbles<00:00:53.520> work<00:00:53.820> now<00:00:54.510> at<00:00:54.600> this<00:00:54.719> point<00:00:54.930> we<00:00:55.079> gotten

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
bubbles work now at this point we gotten

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.220 
bubbles work now at this point we gotten
to<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:56.250> level<00:00:56.399> where<00:00:56.760> you<00:00:56.789> could<00:00:57.090> decide<00:00:57.750> and

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
to the level where you could decide and

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.810 
to the level where you could decide and
you<00:00:58.320> could<00:00:58.469> test<00:00:58.739> to<00:00:58.980> tell<00:00:59.190> if<00:00:59.370> something<00:00:59.730> was

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
you could test to tell if something was

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.290 
you could test to tell if something was
carbon<00:01:00.149> dioxide<00:01:00.629> or<00:01:00.660> whether<00:01:00.989> it<00:01:01.140> was<00:01:01.230> oxygen

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:02.300 
carbon dioxide or whether it was oxygen

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.539 
carbon dioxide or whether it was oxygen
so<00:01:03.300> he<00:01:03.539> put<00:01:03.719> his<00:01:03.870> plants<00:01:04.320> in<00:01:05.010> this<00:01:05.309> nice<00:01:05.519> little

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
so he put his plants in this nice little

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.149 
so he put his plants in this nice little
contraption<00:01:06.360> and<00:01:06.720> he<00:01:07.500> put<00:01:07.710> them<00:01:07.830> under<00:01:08.040> the

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
contraption and he put them under the

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.010 
contraption and he put them under the
light<00:01:08.369> and<00:01:08.610> let<00:01:08.760> them<00:01:08.939> produce<00:01:09.119> bubbles<00:01:09.780> and

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
light and let them produce bubbles and

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.840 
light and let them produce bubbles and
he<00:01:10.500> learned<00:01:10.710> a<00:01:10.799> couple<00:01:10.920> things<00:01:11.100> he<00:01:11.640> learned

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
he learned a couple things he learned

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.870 
he learned a couple things he learned
that<00:01:12.000> in<00:01:12.540> the<00:01:12.630> light<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.950> plants<00:01:14.340> the<00:01:14.549> bubbles

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
that in the light the plants the bubbles

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.359 
that in the light the plants the bubbles
that<00:01:15.060> they<00:01:15.180> gave<00:01:15.360> off<00:01:15.540> for<00:01:15.750> oxygen<00:01:16.290> melts<00:01:16.650> and

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
that they gave off for oxygen melts and

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.539 
that they gave off for oxygen melts and
he<00:01:18.000> measured<00:01:18.270> the<00:01:18.330> amount<00:01:18.720> and<00:01:19.470> then<00:01:20.130> he<00:01:20.280> said

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
he measured the amount and then he said

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.820 
he measured the amount and then he said
he<00:01:21.509> put<00:01:21.689> the<00:01:21.720> plants<00:01:22.140> in<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:22.320> dark<00:01:22.560> and

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
he put the plants in the dark and

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.380 
he put the plants in the dark and
noticed<00:01:23.250> they<00:01:23.340> still<00:01:23.580> produce<00:01:23.759> some<00:01:24.060> bubbles

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
noticed they still produce some bubbles

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:25.789 
noticed they still produce some bubbles
but<00:01:24.720> they<00:01:24.960> were<00:01:25.049> different<00:01:25.439> because<00:01:25.500> in<00:01:25.710> the

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
but they were different because in the

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.170 
but they were different because in the
dark<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.250> bubbles<00:01:26.549> they<00:01:26.670> produced<00:01:27.000> were

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
dark the bubbles they produced were

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.660 
dark the bubbles they produced were
carbon<00:01:27.570> dioxide<00:01:28.110> and<00:01:28.740> he<00:01:28.860> also<00:01:29.009> measured<00:01:29.340> they

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
carbon dioxide and he also measured they

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.929 
carbon dioxide and he also measured they
got<00:01:29.850> there<00:01:30.150> and<00:01:30.479> in<00:01:31.380> the<00:01:31.560> relative<00:01:31.950> amounts<00:01:32.520> he

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
got there and in the relative amounts he

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.569 
got there and in the relative amounts he
saw<00:01:33.180> that<00:01:33.630> the<00:01:34.470> plants<00:01:34.829> produced<00:01:35.159> overall

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
saw that the plants produced overall

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.670 
saw that the plants produced overall
more<00:01:36.000> oxygen<00:01:36.630> in<00:01:36.750> the<00:01:36.869> light<00:01:37.079> than<00:01:37.500> they<00:01:37.619> did

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
more oxygen in the light than they did

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.240 
more oxygen in the light than they did
carbon<00:01:38.189> dioxide<00:01:38.670> in<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:38.939> dark<00:01:39.180> and<00:01:40.220> like<00:01:41.220> I

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
carbon dioxide in the dark and like I

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.520 
carbon dioxide in the dark and like I
said<00:01:41.520> before<00:01:41.670> only<00:01:42.119> the<00:01:42.329> green<00:01:42.600> parts<00:01:43.020> were

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
said before only the green parts were

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.679 
said before only the green parts were
making<00:01:43.860> the<00:01:43.950> oxygen<00:01:44.460> but<00:01:45.119> all<00:01:45.299> the<00:01:45.509> parts

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
making the oxygen but all the parts

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.749 
making the oxygen but all the parts
including<00:01:46.200> the<00:01:46.229> roots<00:01:46.920> and<00:01:47.159> that<00:01:47.220> non<00:01:47.490> green

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
including the roots and that non green

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.569 
including the roots and that non green
parts<00:01:48.030> would<00:01:48.210> produce<00:01:48.420> the<00:01:48.689> carbon<00:01:48.990> dioxide

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:49.579 
parts would produce the carbon dioxide

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:53.539 
parts would produce the carbon dioxide
so<00:01:50.579> he<00:01:50.820> realized<00:01:51.000> that<00:01:51.509> plants<00:01:52.110> do<00:01:52.590> fix<00:01:53.189> the

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
so he realized that plants do fix the

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:57.050 
so he realized that plants do fix the
air<00:01:53.700> they<00:01:54.030> produce<00:01:54.240> oxygen<00:01:55.399> but<00:01:56.399> they<00:01:56.850> can

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
air they produce oxygen but they can

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.060 
air they produce oxygen but they can
also<00:01:57.210> produce<00:01:57.570> carbon<00:01:58.020> dioxide<00:01:58.049> so<00:01:58.770> they<00:01:58.890> can

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
also produce carbon dioxide so they can

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.149 
also produce carbon dioxide so they can
enter<00:01:59.219> the<00:01:59.520> air<00:01:59.640> just

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:00.159 
enter the air just

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:02.039 
enter the air just
like<00:02:00.280> the<00:02:00.490> animals<00:02:00.880> do<00:02:01.149> under<00:02:01.840> certain

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:02.049 
like the animals do under certain

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:08.460 
like the animals do under certain
circumstances<00:02:05.340> so<00:02:06.929> there<00:02:07.929> we<00:02:08.050> go

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470 
circumstances so there we go

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:10.800 
circumstances so there we go
our<00:02:08.530> next<00:02:08.979> we<00:02:09.789> now<00:02:09.970> know<00:02:10.209> that<00:02:10.239> light<00:02:10.629> is

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
our next we now know that light is

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:12.479 
our next we now know that light is
really<00:02:10.959> important<00:02:11.440> we<00:02:11.560> know<00:02:11.680> the<00:02:11.860> green<00:02:12.190> is

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:12.489 
really important we know the green is

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:17.300 
really important we know the green is
important<00:02:13.000> what's<00:02:13.299> going<00:02:13.480> to<00:02:13.510> happen<00:02:13.780> next

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.759 

all<00:02:18.310> right<00:02:18.430> our<00:02:18.670> next<00:02:18.700> guy<00:02:19.150> I<00:02:19.569> really<00:02:20.560> can't

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:20.769 
all right our next guy I really can't

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:23.449 
all right our next guy I really can't
say<00:02:20.920> his<00:02:21.040> name<00:02:21.250> so<00:02:21.430> I'm<00:02:21.489> not<00:02:21.610> going<00:02:21.790> to<00:02:21.879> try<00:02:22.060> um

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
say his name so I'm not going to try um

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:27.390 
say his name so I'm not going to try um
this<00:02:24.459> saucer<00:02:24.940> I<00:02:25.360> probably<00:02:26.319> screwed<00:02:26.739> that<00:02:26.950> up

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
this saucer I probably screwed that up

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.589 
this saucer I probably screwed that up
alright<00:02:28.239> so<00:02:28.650> remember<00:02:29.650> back<00:02:29.920> we<00:02:30.459> had<00:02:30.730> our<00:02:31.030> very

00:02:31.589 --> 00:02:31.599 
alright so remember back we had our very

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:35.339 
alright so remember back we had our very
first<00:02:31.720> yawn<00:02:32.560> that<00:02:32.980> said<00:02:33.310> that<00:02:33.910> it<00:02:34.720> was<00:02:34.989> water

00:02:35.339 --> 00:02:35.349 
first yawn that said that it was water

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:37.559 
first yawn that said that it was water
that<00:02:36.129> was<00:02:36.280> making<00:02:36.489> up<00:02:36.730> the<00:02:36.849> plants<00:02:37.209> cuz<00:02:37.390> that's

00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:37.569 
that was making up the plants cuz that's

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:41.280 
that was making up the plants cuz that's
all<00:02:37.720> he<00:02:37.959> added<00:02:38.370> well<00:02:39.370> this<00:02:40.120> guy<00:02:40.450> discovered

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
all he added well this guy discovered

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.050 
all he added well this guy discovered
that<00:02:41.590> actually<00:02:42.010> it<00:02:42.190> wasn't<00:02:42.549> just<00:02:42.670> water<00:02:42.910> and

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
that actually it wasn't just water and

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:44.970 
that actually it wasn't just water and
the<00:02:43.299> way<00:02:43.390> he<00:02:43.540> figured<00:02:43.840> it<00:02:43.930> out<00:02:44.019> with<00:02:44.200> this<00:02:44.410> he

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
the way he figured it out with this he

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:46.650 
the way he figured it out with this he
put<00:02:45.220> his<00:02:45.519> lovely<00:02:45.730> plant<00:02:46.090> in<00:02:46.360> a<00:02:46.420> closed

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
put his lovely plant in a closed

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:51.030 
put his lovely plant in a closed
container<00:02:46.690> and<00:02:48.900> he<00:02:49.900> put<00:02:50.110> carbon<00:02:50.530> dioxide<00:02:50.920> in

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
container and he put carbon dioxide in

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.470 
container and he put carbon dioxide in
there<00:02:51.129> and<00:02:51.250> now<00:02:51.310> he<00:02:51.370> actually<00:02:51.730> lived<00:02:52.060> down<00:02:52.269> the

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
there and now he actually lived down the

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.240 
there and now he actually lived down the
street<00:02:52.510> from<00:02:52.780> a<00:02:53.049> brewery<00:02:53.560> that<00:02:53.859> would<00:02:54.129> give

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
street from a brewery that would give

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:56.250 
street from a brewery that would give
him<00:02:54.430> free<00:02:54.700> carbon<00:02:55.000> dioxide<00:02:55.629> which<00:02:56.109> is<00:02:56.230> a

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
him free carbon dioxide which is a

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:57.869 
him free carbon dioxide which is a
pretty<00:02:56.560> good<00:02:56.739> deal<00:02:56.950> if<00:02:57.129> you<00:02:57.220> ask<00:02:57.250> me

00:02:57.869 --> 00:02:57.879 
pretty good deal if you ask me

00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:02.130 
pretty good deal if you ask me
so<00:02:59.190> Tina<00:03:00.190> carbon<00:03:00.819> dioxide<00:03:01.209> and<00:03:01.420> he<00:03:01.569> put<00:03:01.810> in<00:03:01.989> an

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140 
so Tina carbon dioxide and he put in an

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:03.930 
so Tina carbon dioxide and he put in an
exact<00:03:02.470> amount<00:03:02.650> that<00:03:02.859> he<00:03:03.069> measured<00:03:03.549> and<00:03:03.819> he

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
exact amount that he measured and he

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:05.580 
exact amount that he measured and he
waved<00:03:04.180> the<00:03:04.299> plant<00:03:04.569> and<00:03:04.780> he<00:03:04.900> played<00:03:05.109> the<00:03:05.290> carbon

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
waved the plant and he played the carbon

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:06.990 
waved the plant and he played the carbon
dioxide<00:03:05.950> that<00:03:06.099> he<00:03:06.220> put<00:03:06.430> in<00:03:06.519> the<00:03:06.609> container

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
dioxide that he put in the container

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.780 
dioxide that he put in the container
with<00:03:07.359> the<00:03:07.389> plant<00:03:07.980> as<00:03:08.980> you<00:03:09.160> can<00:03:09.310> see<00:03:09.489> this<00:03:09.579> is<00:03:09.760> a

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 
with the plant as you can see this is a

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:11.250 
with the plant as you can see this is a
little<00:03:10.120> later<00:03:10.329> we're<00:03:10.599> getting<00:03:10.810> at<00:03:10.930> the<00:03:10.959> age<00:03:11.230> of

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
little later we're getting at the age of

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.020 
little later we're getting at the age of
hundreds<00:03:11.739> we<00:03:11.889> had<00:03:12.069> better<00:03:12.310> equipment<00:03:12.639> where

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
hundreds we had better equipment where

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:17.129 
hundreds we had better equipment where
we<00:03:13.120> could<00:03:13.269> do<00:03:13.359> things<00:03:13.630> like<00:03:13.810> that<00:03:15.450> now<00:03:16.450> he

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:17.139 
we could do things like that now he

00:03:17.139 --> 00:03:19.440 
we could do things like that now he
since<00:03:17.560> we<00:03:17.680> already<00:03:17.829> knew<00:03:18.130> from<00:03:19.120> ingen-housz

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:19.450 
since we already knew from ingen-housz

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:21.750 
since we already knew from ingen-housz
that<00:03:19.989> you<00:03:20.230> needed<00:03:20.410> Sun<00:03:20.769> he<00:03:21.069> put<00:03:21.250> it<00:03:21.370> in<00:03:21.489> the<00:03:21.519> Sun

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760 
that you needed Sun he put it in the Sun

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.530 
that you needed Sun he put it in the Sun
and<00:03:23.280> after<00:03:24.280> he'd<00:03:24.790> been<00:03:24.819> sitting<00:03:25.209> in<00:03:25.239> the<00:03:25.329> Sun<00:03:25.510> a

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540 
and after he'd been sitting in the Sun a

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.360 
and after he'd been sitting in the Sun a
while<00:03:25.780> he<00:03:26.169> measured<00:03:26.500> the<00:03:26.560> weight<00:03:26.769> of<00:03:27.010> the<00:03:27.160> plan

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370 
while he measured the weight of the plan

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:29.640 
while he measured the weight of the plan
in<00:03:27.549> the<00:03:27.609> carbon<00:03:27.910> dioxide<00:03:28.359> and<00:03:28.690> he<00:03:29.049> discovered

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:29.650 
in the carbon dioxide and he discovered

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:32.430 
in the carbon dioxide and he discovered
that<00:03:30.000> the<00:03:31.000> amount<00:03:31.269> of<00:03:31.329> carbon<00:03:31.690> dioxide<00:03:31.720> went

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
that the amount of carbon dioxide went

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:36.920 
that the amount of carbon dioxide went
down<00:03:32.730> and<00:03:34.290> the<00:03:35.290> mass<00:03:35.500> of<00:03:35.769> the<00:03:35.859> plant<00:03:36.099> went<00:03:36.310> up

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
down and the mass of the plant went up

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:42.120 
down and the mass of the plant went up
but<00:03:37.930> the<00:03:38.230> mass<00:03:38.410> of<00:03:38.620> the<00:03:38.680> plant<00:03:39.720> didn't<00:03:40.720> go<00:03:41.130> it

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:42.130 
but the mass of the plant didn't go it

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:44.069 
but the mass of the plant didn't go it
went<00:03:42.519> up<00:03:42.669> more<00:03:43.000> than<00:03:43.389> the<00:03:43.480> amount<00:03:43.690> of<00:03:43.750> carbon

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:44.079 
went up more than the amount of carbon

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:46.559 
went up more than the amount of carbon
dioxide<00:03:44.109> went<00:03:44.620> down<00:03:44.829> so<00:03:45.579> he<00:03:45.760> concluded<00:03:46.030> that

00:03:46.559 --> 00:03:46.569 
dioxide went down so he concluded that

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:48.750 
dioxide went down so he concluded that
the<00:03:46.930> carbon<00:03:47.290> dioxide<00:03:47.380> must<00:03:48.069> be<00:03:48.280> having<00:03:48.430> to<00:03:48.669> the

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
the carbon dioxide must be having to the

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.839 
the carbon dioxide must be having to the
plants<00:03:49.060> mass<00:03:49.269> and<00:03:49.690> then<00:03:50.410> the<00:03:50.650> rest<00:03:50.950> of<00:03:51.310> the

00:03:51.839 --> 00:03:51.849 
plants mass and then the rest of the

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:52.790 
plants mass and then the rest of the
addition<00:03:52.239> of<00:03:52.359> mass

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:52.800 
addition of mass

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:54.590 
addition of mass
must<00:03:52.980> be<00:03:53.130> from<00:03:53.310> water<00:03:53.520> so<00:03:53.910> he<00:03:54.060> discovered<00:03:54.390> that

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:54.600 
must be from water so he discovered that

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:57.110 
must be from water so he discovered that
it<00:03:54.720> wasn't<00:03:54.900> just<00:03:55.080> water<00:03:55.860> it<00:03:56.310> was<00:03:56.430> also<00:03:56.880> carbon

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
it wasn't just water it was also carbon

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.960 
it wasn't just water it was also carbon
dioxide<00:03:57.750> that<00:03:58.470> plants<00:03:59.010> took<00:03:59.250> in<00:03:59.430> and<00:03:59.730> that

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
dioxide that plants took in and that

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:01.730 
dioxide that plants took in and that
gave<00:04:00.120> them<00:04:00.330> mass<00:04:00.540> so<00:04:00.810> it<00:04:00.870> was<00:04:00.960> a<00:04:01.050> combination

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:01.740 
gave them mass so it was a combination

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:08.030 
gave them mass so it was a combination
of<00:04:01.860> the<00:04:02.040> two<00:04:03.980> and<00:04:04.980> he's<00:04:05.130> French<00:04:05.400> voila<00:04:07.040> carbon

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
of the two and he's French voila carbon

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:14.540 
of the two and he's French voila carbon
dioxide<00:04:08.490> and<00:04:12.320> so<00:04:13.320> now<00:04:13.500> what<00:04:13.860> is<00:04:14.070> the<00:04:14.250> plant

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:14.550 
dioxide and so now what is the plant

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:17.810 
dioxide and so now what is the plant
doing<00:04:15.330> where<00:04:16.080> is<00:04:16.380> that<00:04:16.650> water<00:04:17.010> and<00:04:17.430> carbon

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:17.820 
doing where is that water and carbon

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:21.259 
doing where is that water and carbon
dioxide<00:04:17.850> going<00:04:18.750> and<00:04:19.560> this<00:04:20.280> is<00:04:20.489> where<00:04:20.670> we<00:04:20.790> get<00:04:21.030> a

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:21.269 
dioxide going and this is where we get a

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:22.580 
dioxide going and this is where we get a
nice<00:04:21.480> German<00:04:21.930> guy

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:22.590 
nice German guy

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:27.500 
nice German guy
Julius<00:04:23.130> on<00:04:23.370> socks<00:04:23.930> and<00:04:25.640> he<00:04:26.640> discovered<00:04:27.210> that

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:27.510 
Julius on socks and he discovered that

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:30.350 
Julius on socks and he discovered that
when<00:04:28.320> you<00:04:28.560> put<00:04:28.770> plants<00:04:29.070> in<00:04:29.370> sunlight<00:04:29.940> they

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:30.360 
when you put plants in sunlight they

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:33.350 
when you put plants in sunlight they
would<00:04:30.540> make<00:04:30.750> starch<00:04:31.520> he<00:04:32.520> was<00:04:32.670> able<00:04:32.850> to<00:04:33.030> figure

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:33.360 
would make starch he was able to figure

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.690 
would make starch he was able to figure
out<00:04:33.540> how<00:04:33.750> to<00:04:33.810> visualize<00:04:34.650> starch<00:04:35.130> in<00:04:35.430> plant

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:35.700 
out how to visualize starch in plant

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:39.650 
out how to visualize starch in plant
cells<00:04:36.590> but<00:04:37.590> then<00:04:37.770> if<00:04:38.250> you<00:04:38.820> put<00:04:39.090> the<00:04:39.210> same<00:04:39.390> plant

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:39.660 
cells but then if you put the same plant

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:41.360 
cells but then if you put the same plant
and<00:04:39.870> kept<00:04:40.050> it<00:04:40.200> in<00:04:40.290> the<00:04:40.350> dark<00:04:40.650> didn't<00:04:41.160> give<00:04:41.250> it

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:41.370 
and kept it in the dark didn't give it

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:43.430 
and kept it in the dark didn't give it
any<00:04:41.430> Sun<00:04:41.820> the<00:04:42.240> starch<00:04:42.540> and<00:04:42.780> the<00:04:42.870> leaves<00:04:43.140> would

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:43.440 
any Sun the starch and the leaves would

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:46.990 
any Sun the starch and the leaves would
gradually<00:04:43.980> go<00:04:44.190> away<00:04:44.520> it<00:04:45.450> would<00:04:45.600> get<00:04:45.720> used<00:04:46.050> up

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:47.000 
gradually go away it would get used up

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.740 
gradually go away it would get used up
so<00:04:48.890> he<00:04:49.890> concluded<00:04:50.190> that<00:04:50.460> this<00:04:51.180> process<00:04:51.720> that

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:51.750 
so he concluded that this process that

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:53.390 
so he concluded that this process that
happened<00:04:52.230> in<00:04:52.320> the<00:04:52.380> Sun<00:04:52.620> which<00:04:53.010> we<00:04:53.160> are<00:04:53.280> now

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:53.400 
happened in the Sun which we are now

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:56.270 
happened in the Sun which we are now
calling<00:04:53.700> photosynthesis<00:04:54.620> was<00:04:55.620> making<00:04:56.160> the

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:56.280 
calling photosynthesis was making the

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:58.880 
calling photosynthesis was making the
starch<00:04:56.550> and<00:04:56.970> then<00:04:57.630> the<00:04:57.780> plant<00:04:58.050> used<00:04:58.380> up<00:04:58.680> the

00:04:58.880 --> 00:04:58.890 
starch and then the plant used up the

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:01.820 
starch and then the plant used up the
starch<00:04:59.190> they<00:04:59.910> think<00:05:00.180> the<00:05:00.840> carbon<00:05:01.380> dioxide

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:01.830 
starch they think the carbon dioxide

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:03.470 
starch they think the carbon dioxide
producing<00:05:02.340> activity<00:05:02.850> that<00:05:03.090> we<00:05:03.210> talked<00:05:03.419> about

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:03.480 
producing activity that we talked about

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:05.600 
producing activity that we talked about
before<00:05:03.840> that<00:05:04.260> happened<00:05:04.560> in<00:05:04.650> the<00:05:04.740> dark<00:05:04.980> used<00:05:05.400> up

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:05.610 
before that happened in the dark used up

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:08.810 
before that happened in the dark used up
the<00:05:05.760> starch<00:05:06.120> so<00:05:06.660> light<00:05:07.620> make<00:05:08.010> the<00:05:08.130> starch<00:05:08.400> the

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:08.820 
the starch so light make the starch the

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:11.440 
the starch so light make the starch the
dark<00:05:09.060> used<00:05:09.330> up<00:05:09.510> the<00:05:09.630> starch<00:05:09.930> the<00:05:10.710> light<00:05:10.890> image

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:11.450 
dark used up the starch the light image

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:14.690 
dark used up the starch the light image
the<00:05:12.450> photosynthesis<00:05:13.200> made<00:05:13.500> the<00:05:13.650> starch<00:05:13.950> the

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:14.700 
the photosynthesis made the starch the

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:20.480 
the photosynthesis made the starch the
respiration<00:05:15.380> used<00:05:16.380> up<00:05:16.590> the<00:05:16.770> starch<00:05:19.250> so<00:05:20.250> now<00:05:20.430> we

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:20.490 
respiration used up the starch so now we

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:22.940 
respiration used up the starch so now we
have<00:05:20.850> most<00:05:21.240> of<00:05:21.419> our<00:05:21.510> steps<00:05:21.840> here<00:05:22.230> we<00:05:22.650> have<00:05:22.830> our

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:22.950 
have most of our steps here we have our

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:25.640 
have most of our steps here we have our
light<00:05:23.220> we<00:05:23.970> have<00:05:24.180> our<00:05:24.330> water<00:05:24.630> we<00:05:25.410> have<00:05:25.530> our

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:25.650 
light we have our water we have our

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:27.590 
light we have our water we have our
carbon<00:05:25.980> dioxide<00:05:26.430> we<00:05:26.730> have<00:05:26.880> our<00:05:27.000> sugar<00:05:27.210> it's

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:27.600 
carbon dioxide we have our sugar it's

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:29.210 
carbon dioxide we have our sugar it's
remember<00:05:27.900> starch<00:05:28.230> is<00:05:28.530> just<00:05:28.830> a<00:05:28.919> bunch<00:05:29.100> of

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:29.220 
remember starch is just a bunch of

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:31.970 
remember starch is just a bunch of
sugars<00:05:29.520> hook<00:05:29.730> it<00:05:29.820> together<00:05:30.290> so<00:05:31.290> we<00:05:31.410> kind<00:05:31.919> of

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:31.980 
sugars hook it together so we kind of

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:33.950 
sugars hook it together so we kind of
have<00:05:32.130> our<00:05:32.340> whole<00:05:32.520> equation<00:05:32.850> so<00:05:33.780> now<00:05:33.900> we

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:33.960 
have our whole equation so now we

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:35.600 
have our whole equation so now we
started<00:05:34.470> looking<00:05:34.770> more<00:05:34.800> at<00:05:35.010> the<00:05:35.130> details

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:35.610 
started looking more at the details

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:37.040 
started looking more at the details
because<00:05:36.090> now<00:05:36.210> we're<00:05:36.390> getting<00:05:36.630> close<00:05:36.810> to<00:05:36.840> the

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:37.050 
because now we're getting close to the

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:38.930 
because now we're getting close to the
1900s<00:05:37.530> and<00:05:37.980> we're<00:05:38.070> getting<00:05:38.310> more<00:05:38.580> of<00:05:38.820> the

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:38.940 
1900s and we're getting more of the

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:41.450 
1900s and we're getting more of the
nitty-gritty<00:05:39.120> ok<00:05:39.900> the<00:05:40.650> other<00:05:40.770> basic<00:05:41.190> steps

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:41.460 
nitty-gritty ok the other basic steps

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:44.150 
nitty-gritty ok the other basic steps
what<00:05:41.760> comes<00:05:41.970> next
