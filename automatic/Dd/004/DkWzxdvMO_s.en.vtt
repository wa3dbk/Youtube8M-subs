00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:36.179 
perfect I mean you want it to be pretty
even<00:01:35.320> looking<00:01:35.650> but<00:01:35.860> we're<00:01:36.010> gonna<00:01:36.100> put

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:36.189 
even looking but we're gonna put

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:38.290 
eyeshadow on top of it

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:42.539 
eyeshadow on top of it
so<00:01:39.250> it<00:01:39.460> doesn't<00:01:39.700> have<00:01:39.790> to<00:01:39.909> be<00:01:40.000> like<00:01:41.549> amazing

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:42.549 
so it doesn't have to be like amazing

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:50.640 
so it doesn't have to be like amazing
looking

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:50.650 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:52.560 

okay<00:01:51.280> so<00:01:51.340> once<00:01:51.670> it<00:01:51.820> looks<00:01:51.940> something<00:01:52.240> like

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:52.570 
okay so once it looks something like

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:56.670 
okay so once it looks something like
that<00:01:53.190> should<00:01:54.190> be<00:01:54.250> okay<00:01:55.090> this<00:01:55.930> is<00:01:56.110> actually<00:01:56.290> my

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:56.680 
that should be okay this is actually my

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.760 
that should be okay this is actually my
first<00:01:56.890> time<00:01:57.130> using<00:01:57.310> the<00:01:57.550> specific<00:01:57.790> black<00:01:58.770> so

00:01:59.760 --> 00:01:59.770 
first time using the specific black so

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:01.290 
first time using the specific black so
hopefully<00:02:00.580> it<00:02:00.640> turns<00:02:00.730> out<00:02:00.940> okay<00:02:01.060> I<00:02:01.240> just

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:01.300

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:46.209 
going to go in and just blend this out

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:50.970

if<00:03:47.049> it<00:03:47.379> will<00:03:47.500> go<00:03:47.739> yes<00:03:48.370> it<00:03:48.549> is<00:03:49.440> so<00:03:50.440> just<00:03:50.650> blend

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:50.980 
if it will go yes it is so just blend

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:54.270 
if it will go yes it is so just blend
this<00:03:51.310> whole<00:03:51.549> crease<00:03:52.739> and<00:03:53.739> it's<00:03:53.890> just<00:03:54.040> going<00:03:54.190> to

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.280 
this whole crease and it's just going to

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.369 
this whole crease and it's just going to
create<00:03:54.579> kind<00:03:54.879> of<00:03:55.000> a<00:03:55.120> lighter<00:03:55.450> brown<00:03:56.319> color

00:03:56.369 --> 00:03:56.379 
create kind of a lighter brown color

00:03:56.379 --> 00:04:00.990 
create kind of a lighter brown color
right<00:03:57.040> right<00:03:57.640> there<00:03:57.970> and<00:03:58.120> then<00:03:58.239> crease<00:03:59.879> so<00:04:00.879> it

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:01.000 
right right there and then crease so it

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.520 
right right there and then crease so it
might<00:04:01.120> take<00:04:01.299> quite<00:04:01.329> a<00:04:01.629> little<00:04:01.989> bit<00:04:02.260> of

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:02.530 
might take quite a little bit of

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:04.500 
might take quite a little bit of
blending<00:04:02.980> to<00:04:03.190> really<00:04:03.670> get<00:04:03.850> that<00:04:04.000> out<00:04:04.239> you

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:04.510 
blending to really get that out you

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:07.680 
blending to really get that out you
don't<00:04:04.600> have<00:04:04.690> any<00:04:04.989> harsh<00:04:05.380> lines<00:04:06.329> but<00:04:07.329> in<00:04:07.540> the

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:07.690 
don't have any harsh lines but in the

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:17.470 
don't have any harsh lines but in the
end<00:04:07.840> it<00:04:08.019> will<00:04:08.170> be<00:04:08.230> worth<00:04:08.350> it

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:17.480 

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:19.720 

okay<00:04:18.080> so<00:04:18.140> my<00:04:18.410> shape<00:04:18.680> is<00:04:18.830> different<00:04:19.370> than

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:19.730 
okay so my shape is different than

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:22.570 
okay so my shape is different than
Kristen's<00:04:20.590> obviously<00:04:21.590> so<00:04:21.860> it<00:04:21.950> might<00:04:22.100> turn<00:04:22.460> out

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:22.580 
Kristen's obviously so it might turn out

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:25.000 
Kristen's obviously so it might turn out
a<00:04:22.670> little<00:04:22.850> bit<00:04:23.090> different<00:04:23.540> depending<00:04:24.290> on<00:04:24.440> what

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:25.010 
a little bit different depending on what

an<00:04:57.740> interesting<00:04:57.980> move<00:04:58.670> but<00:04:58.910> it<00:04:59.030> almost<00:04:59.300> looks

00:04:59.560 --> 00:04:59.570 
an interesting move but it almost looks

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:03.010 
an interesting move but it almost looks
like<00:04:59.630> she<00:04:59.900> has<00:05:00.170> like<00:05:00.850> gray<00:05:01.850> like<00:05:02.330> an<00:05:02.510> eyeliner

eyes are finished now just one tip is to

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:57.640 
eyes are finished now just one tip is to
make<00:05:56.090> sure<00:05:56.270> you<00:05:56.450> blend<00:05:56.750> like<00:05:57.020> the<00:05:57.200> liner<00:05:57.440> on

00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:57.650 
make sure you blend like the liner on

00:05:57.650 --> 00:05:58.840 
make sure you blend like the liner on
the<00:05:57.680> bottom<00:05:58.070> with<00:05:58.220> the<00:05:58.250> liner<00:05:58.550> in<00:05:58.760> the

00:05:58.840 --> 00:05:58.850 
the bottom with the liner in the

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:00.280 
the bottom with the liner in the
waterline<00:05:59.270> make<00:05:59.480> sure<00:05:59.630> you<00:05:59.750> get<00:05:59.900> them<00:06:00.080> right

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:00.290 
waterline make sure you get them right

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:01.480 
waterline make sure you get them right
in<00:06:00.410> your<00:06:00.440> lashes<00:06:00.680> so<00:06:00.920> you<00:06:01.070> don't<00:06:01.190> have<00:06:01.280> like<00:06:01.460> a

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:01.490 
in your lashes so you don't have like a

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:03.910 
in your lashes so you don't have like a
line<00:06:02.180> of<00:06:02.330> skin<00:06:02.780> going<00:06:03.050> in<00:06:03.290> between<00:06:03.440> the<00:06:03.650> two

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:03.920 
line of skin going in between the two

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:06.700 
line of skin going in between the two
lines<00:06:04.240> so<00:06:05.240> that's<00:06:05.570> pretty<00:06:05.750> much<00:06:05.870> the<00:06:06.080> eyes<00:06:06.290> of

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:06.710 
lines so that's pretty much the eyes of

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:08.260 
lines so that's pretty much the eyes of

hopefully it was easy enough I wanted it
to<00:06:45.090> be<00:06:45.210> something<00:06:45.390> that<00:06:45.690> was<00:06:45.810> pretty<00:06:45.990> simple<00:06:46.260> I

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:46.500 
to be something that was pretty simple I

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:48.350 
to be something that was pretty simple I
saw<00:06:46.770> somebody<00:06:47.010> else<00:06:47.130> had<00:06:47.430> one<00:06:47.640> on<00:06:47.730> YouTube<00:06:47.910> and

saw somebody else had one on YouTube and

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:50.330 
saw somebody else had one on YouTube and
it<00:06:48.720> was<00:06:48.780> kind<00:06:49.020> of<00:06:49.110> different<00:06:49.290> looking<00:06:49.740> so<00:06:50.190> this

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:50.340 
it was kind of different looking so this

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:53.090 
it was kind of different looking so this
is<00:06:50.490> I<00:06:50.760> guess<00:06:50.940> my<00:06:51.120> interpretation<00:06:51.810> of<00:06:52.100> Kristen

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:53.100 
is I guess my interpretation of Kristen

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:56.470 
is I guess my interpretation of Kristen
