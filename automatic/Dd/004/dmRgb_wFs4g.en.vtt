00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:10.320
 they are hardly explored enough 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:12.900
 unusual features and resemble each other 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.660
 in some ways like twins uranus and 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.630
 Neptune the two outer planets 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.420
 of our solar system 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:23.279
 Planet researchers still have some puzzles 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:26.189
 the two icy outsiders have 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.619
 some similarities both shine 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.050
 bluish though they are neither several yet 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.640
 own liquid water 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:35.040
 it is the fault of an outer shell 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.720
 Methane gas under the clouds 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.660
 frozen methane lie 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:42.190
 both planets are ice giant 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:45.040
 tremendous pressure and the outside 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:47.470
 acting cold ensure that the 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:49.210
 Hot solid core of a thick coat 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:51.880
 from an ice-like mixture of 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:54.180
 water ammonia methane and 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:56.680
 surrounded by rocks 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.260
 on the net romp the fastest 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:01.239
 storms of the solar system reach you 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:03.210
 wind speed of up to 2100 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:05.440
 kilometers per hour 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:08.500
 striking in the voyager's recordings 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:10.060
 but also the big dark spot one 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:13.780
 storm vortex after five years 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:15.820
 where did the weather phenomena disappear? 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:18.400
 neptune but also hornuss your energy 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:20.590
 take is unclear because inner heat 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:22.240
 the planets do not and that 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:25.180
 Sunlight is extremely high out there 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.800
 weak maybe the strong one is playing 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:28.810
 axis tilt a role for 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:32.770
 ensures decades of seasons 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:35.140
 But that is still speculation and 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:36.940
 both uranus and neptune have one 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:38.140
 pretty unusual magnetic field with 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:40.570
 equal to four poles 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:43.450
 Why this is so far remains 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:45.970
 enigmatic through the complex arrangement 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:49.210
 The field lines are the polar lights on 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:51.490
 this planet punctiform in the early 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:54.070
 solar system , the neptune he comes to the 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:55.690
 sun as its neighbor uranus first 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:57.820
 subsequently changed both planets 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:00.780
 the places and moved to theirs 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.780
 current orbit
