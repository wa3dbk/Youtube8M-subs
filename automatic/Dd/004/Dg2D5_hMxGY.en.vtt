assassins<00:02:00.700> hidden<00:02:00.910> blade<00:02:01.120> and<00:02:01.420> then<00:02:02.080> you

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.350 
assassins hidden blade and then you

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:04.830 
assassins hidden blade and then you
combine<00:02:02.680> the<00:02:03.130> blade<00:02:03.400> with<00:02:03.790> the<00:02:03.970> gun<00:02:04.150> and<00:02:04.450> there
