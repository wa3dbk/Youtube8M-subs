okay<00:00:00.840> this<00:00:01.020> is<00:00:01.140> a<00:00:01.170> video<00:00:01.469> on<00:00:01.650> how<00:00:01.680> to<00:00:01.829> change

00:00:02.119 --> 00:00:02.129 
okay this is a video on how to change

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:07.010 
okay this is a video on how to change
your<00:00:02.340> service<00:00:02.730> gravity<00:00:03.149> in<00:00:03.740> CS<00:00:04.740> 1.6<00:00:05.899> once<00:00:06.899> you

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
your service gravity in CS 1.6 once you

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:08.900 
your service gravity in CS 1.6 once you
log<00:00:07.170> into<00:00:07.319> your<00:00:07.440> game<00:00:07.680> panel<00:00:08.069> click<00:00:08.309> on<00:00:08.490> the

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
log into your game panel click on the

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:14.539 
log into your game panel click on the
gaming<00:00:09.150> services<00:00:09.750> button<00:00:12.469> and<00:00:13.469> then<00:00:14.130> click<00:00:14.400> on

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
gaming services button and then click on

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.189 
gaming services button and then click on
your<00:00:14.670> server<00:00:14.940> IP<00:00:17.600> give<00:00:18.600> that<00:00:18.779> a<00:00:18.810> couple

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
your server IP give that a couple

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:27.740 
your server IP give that a couple
seconds<00:00:19.590> to<00:00:19.740> load

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.560 

and<00:00:28.650> then<00:00:28.860> click<00:00:29.130> on<00:00:29.250> default<00:00:29.940> config<00:00:30.720> files

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:32.570 
and then click on default config files

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:44.490 
and then click on default config files
and<00:00:33.570> then<00:00:33.630> click<00:00:33.900> on<00:00:34.050> server<00:00:34.460> CFG

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:44.500 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.830 

then<00:00:45.100> scroll<00:00:45.460> down<00:00:45.520> and<00:00:45.970> look<00:00:46.770> for<00:00:47.770> sv<00:00:48.580> gravity

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
then scroll down and look for sv gravity

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.340 
then scroll down and look for sv gravity
which<00:00:49.840> is<00:00:50.020> right<00:00:50.170> here<00:00:51.180> the<00:00:52.180> default<00:00:52.390> setting

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:53.350 
which is right here the default setting

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:58.010 
which is right here the default setting
is<00:00:53.440> 800<00:00:54.690> if<00:00:55.690> you<00:00:55.900> make<00:00:56.050> it<00:00:56.170> higher<00:00:56.400> obviously

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
is 800 if you make it higher obviously

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.540 
is 800 if you make it higher obviously
the<00:00:59.020> gravity<00:00:59.410> will<00:00:59.530> be<00:00:59.620> more<00:00:59.800> intense<00:01:00.130> and<00:01:00.430> if

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:00.550 
the gravity will be more intense and if

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:03.420 
the gravity will be more intense and if
you<00:01:00.670> want<00:01:00.850> it<00:01:01.710> to<00:01:02.710> have<00:01:02.800> like<00:01:02.980> a<00:01:03.010> lower<00:01:03.190> gravity

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:03.430 
you want it to have like a lower gravity

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:05.400 
you want it to have like a lower gravity
setting<00:01:03.940> and<00:01:04.059> make<00:01:04.150> it<00:01:04.270> 100<00:01:04.809> or<00:01:05.080> if<00:01:05.229> you<00:01:05.320> want

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:05.410 
setting and make it 100 or if you want

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:06.810 
setting and make it 100 or if you want
really<00:01:05.710> high<00:01:05.830> set<00:01:06.130> gravities<00:01:06.550> heading<00:01:06.760> you

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:06.820 
really high set gravities heading you

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:10.530 
really high set gravities heading you
can<00:01:06.970> make<00:01:07.090> it<00:01:07.210> 1,000<00:01:08.400> but<00:01:09.400> the<00:01:09.520> default<00:01:09.850> is<00:01:10.030> 800

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:10.540 
can make it 1,000 but the default is 800

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:11.520 
can make it 1,000 but the default is 800
so<00:01:10.660> we're<00:01:10.780> going<00:01:10.869> to<00:01:10.960> keep<00:01:11.080> it<00:01:11.200> at<00:01:11.320> that<00:01:11.350> for

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:11.530 
so we're going to keep it at that for

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:15.000 
so we're going to keep it at that for
now<00:01:11.740> and<00:01:13.229> it's<00:01:14.229> all<00:01:14.350> you<00:01:14.440> have<00:01:14.560> to<00:01:14.650> do<00:01:14.770> and

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:15.010 
now and it's all you have to do and

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:23.470 
now and it's all you have to do and
press<00:01:15.820> save

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:23.480 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:36.600 

and<00:01:23.570> then<00:01:24.380> go<00:01:24.920> back<00:01:25.160> to<00:01:25.640> your<00:01:26.180> server

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:36.610 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:40.810 

and<00:01:37.870> once<00:01:38.870> it's<00:01:39.020> done<00:01:39.170> loading<00:01:39.610> press<00:01:40.610> the

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:40.820 
and once it's done loading press the

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:45.820 
and once it's done loading press the
restart<00:01:41.030> button<00:01:42.130> so<00:01:43.130> that<00:01:43.280> the<00:01:43.370> changes<00:01:44.830> take

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:45.830 
restart button so that the changes take

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:53.560 
restart button so that the changes take
place<00:01:50.200> this<00:01:51.200> also<00:01:51.470> could<00:01:51.740> take<00:01:51.920> a<00:01:51.950> while<00:01:52.570> it

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:53.570 
place this also could take a while it

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:59.280 
place this also could take a while it
all<00:01:53.690> really<00:01:53.869> depends

00:01:59.280 --> 00:01:59.290 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:06.120 

just<00:01:59.890> going<00:02:00.010> to<00:02:00.070> wait<00:02:00.190> for<00:02:00.220> it<00:02:00.400> to<00:02:00.460> finish

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.130 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:08.320 

and<00:02:07.130> it<00:02:07.280> says<00:02:07.460> your<00:02:07.640> game<00:02:07.790> server<00:02:08.149> has<00:02:08.270> been

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
and it says your game server has been

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.410 
and it says your game server has been
restarted<00:02:08.810> and<00:02:09.229> you're<00:02:09.380> good<00:02:09.530> to<00:02:09.560> go<00:02:09.679> and

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
restarted and you're good to go and

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:14.380 
restarted and you're good to go and
that's<00:02:11.420> it<00:02:11.630> for<00:02:11.810> this<00:02:11.900> video<00:02:12.080> tutorial
