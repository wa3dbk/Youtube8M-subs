 kilometers per hour this day in a 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:28.410
 successful jump in free fall since little 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:31.800
 more than 39 thousand meters above the 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:35.040
 new mexico this and you cameras 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.530
 were this balloon is a balloon that 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.829
 usually used for issues 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.829
 meteorological 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:47.539
 you have the height and to the right 38 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:50.180
 1920 is there is about to reach 39 

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:52.280
 kilometers in height is almost three times 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:54.829
 what a commercial plane returns to 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.269
 fly at 13,000 meters you hear a 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:58.399
 captain who says let's thirty and 

00:00:56.269 --> 00:00:59.899
 as many thousand feet tall as that are 

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:02.239
 11,000 meters 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:05.330
 I mean they are almost four times what 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:06.920
 that you are going in a commercial airplane look 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:11.689
 you this man as it is but just 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:17.740
 the time to reach 39 thousand meters 

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:20.810
 above mean sea ​​level 38 99 69 9 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:22.760
 39 thousand there they warned him good this suit 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.820
 special 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:27.920
 I believe that said most holy virgin of 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:30.259
 guadalupe help me 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:33.049
 good he will be entrusted or he lives 

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:35.960
 america treats us but from there we see 

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:38.150
 as children gradually 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.979
 and it was more complicated because the god 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:41.690
 previous one had tried to do this 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:44.000
 jump supported us for issues 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:47.300
 weather I hope until this Sunday 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.130
 and then several issues to say about this 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:50.720
 it's just a matter of the war of the 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:54.080
 physical but also the health of it 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:56.450
 for man undoubtedly Baumgardner 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:58.850
 Sekouba life because of course 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:01.790
 all this needs a lot of preparation 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:04.550
 imagine the physical and mental state that 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:07.340
 has this felix man that is thrown 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:10.750
 of index height well and under the ground 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.750
 I plan with my son- in- law from above 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:17.100
 I do not know if she can bring you 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:21.700
 vertigo waiting there opened him the 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:24.280
 oxygen from the atmosphere there is no oxygen or 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:26.800
 the oxygen concentration does not 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:29.410
 allows to breathe separately requires 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:34.000
 focus for the friction that is generated 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:36.670
 and there he throws himself into the void and begins 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.970
 well, this attempt that they take there with 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:38.970
 a 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.319
 kilometers per hour 4 minutes with 20 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:52.239
 seconds 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:54.569
 and there they look like when he opens the 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:54.569
 parachute 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:01.290
 and there comes the man looking for the 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:03.360
 landing applause at the table 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:05.849
 control all that expedition that was 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.769
 sponsored by the red bull drink but 

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:09.750
 imagine the distance 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:12.250
 practically from a marathon from there 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:14.680
 up this man was launched 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:17.230
 who achieved this feat is the man of 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:20.350
 day all the media of the 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:22.260
 whole world underscore the feat of felix 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:23.460
 baumgartner link 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.370
 Really 

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:29.659
 it is unthinkable 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:32.269
 unprecedented to overcome and practically not 

00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:35.150
 it came to the stratosphere but good from 

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:37.790
 up there to achieve that already because the 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:44.049
 landing did not matter if he craned 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:44.049
 cornelius reyna that is a cloud 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:50.090
 twenty thousand meters high as the 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:54.640
 sense of 39 thousand meters high something 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:54.640
 red and the landing was in addition to all 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:58.900
 he fell on his feet 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:02.049
 unbelievable fantastic what did this 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:05.319
 man felix baumgartner that really 

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:08.480
 is an outstanding hero now the 

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:10.760
 technology assisted him 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:13.640
 and he also attended this work all 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:17.180
 it was done with a lot of technology it was not a 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:18.799
