00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:56.760 
though it wasn't super far behind it was

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:57.830 
though it wasn't super far behind it was
a<00:01:56.790> little<00:01:56.910> bit<00:01:57.240> behind

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
a little bit behind

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.630 
a little bit behind
did<00:01:58.230> you<00:01:58.290> see<00:01:58.410> how<00:01:58.470> slow<00:01:58.710> this<00:01:58.920> one<00:01:58.980> is<00:01:59.280> my

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
did you see how slow this one is my

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.520 
did you see how slow this one is my
magazines<00:02:02.510> could<00:02:03.510> still<00:02:03.780> be<00:02:03.900> fun<00:02:04.110> there<00:02:04.320> to

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
magazines could still be fun there to

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.580 
magazines could still be fun there to
know<00:02:04.710> that<00:02:05.670> a<00:02:06.210> little<00:02:06.510> bit<00:02:06.600> slower<00:02:06.870> but<00:02:07.380> the

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
know that a little bit slower but the

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.410 
know that a little bit slower but the
cam<00:02:07.770> shouldn't<00:02:08.100> be<00:02:08.160> slower<00:02:08.399> I<00:02:08.700> mean<00:02:09.090> it's<00:02:09.270> not

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
cam shouldn't be slower I mean it's not

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.640 
cam shouldn't be slower I mean it's not
like<00:02:09.570> an<00:02:09.690> 800<00:02:10.320> in<00:02:11.250> the<00:02:11.400> s5<00:02:11.870> Snapdragon<00:02:12.870> 801<00:02:13.110> I

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
like an 800 in the s5 Snapdragon 801 I

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.290 
like an 800 in the s5 Snapdragon 801 I
think<00:02:14.220> also<00:02:14.460> it's<00:02:14.730> a<00:02:14.850> little<00:02:15.000> bit<00:02:15.090> higher

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
think also it's a little bit higher

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.120 
think also it's a little bit higher
clock<00:02:15.630> to<00:02:16.200> it's<00:02:16.500> quality<00:02:17.010> set

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
clock to it's quality set

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:18.350 
clock to it's quality set
up<00:02:17.220> to<00:02:17.340> me<00:02:17.460> to<00:02:17.640> get<00:02:17.880> Hertz

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
up to me to get Hertz

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.270 
up to me to get Hertz
so<00:02:18.930> that<00:02:19.080> could<00:02:19.170> definitely<00:02:19.320> be<00:02:19.560> fun<00:02:19.740> even

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
so that could definitely be fun even

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.010 
so that could definitely be fun even
though<00:02:20.520> in<00:02:20.790> the<00:02:20.880> open<00:02:21.120> system<00:02:21.390> it<00:02:21.540> runs<00:02:21.750> very

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
though in the open system it runs very

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:25.460 
though in the open system it runs very
very<00:02:22.440> nice<00:02:23.000> but<00:02:24.000> yeah<00:02:24.150> quickly<00:02:24.930> look<00:02:25.080> at<00:02:25.170> that

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
very nice but yeah quickly look at that

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.760 
very nice but yeah quickly look at that
have<00:02:26.280> an<00:02:26.460> awfully
