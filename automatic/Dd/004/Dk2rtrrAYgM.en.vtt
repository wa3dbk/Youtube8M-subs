00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.220
 we are with diego andrÃ©s ayala santacruz 

00:00:03.909 --> 00:00:07.839
 currently player of the cni version of 

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:11.020
 Norway 

00:00:07.839 --> 00:00:13.780
 I tell you a little bit how it was so that 

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:16.209
 will come to play here in my version so 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:18.900
 far from Paraguay good everything began 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:21.370
 thanks to a proposal that approached me the 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.880
 a friend of mine who is a representative of 

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:26.550
 soccer an argentinian 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.039
 I had commented on the interest of this 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.670
 team with me 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.740
 after speaking 

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:36.200
 enough with my family not to analyze 

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:37.670
 all the things I decided to come and good 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:40.130
 thank god things came out of the 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:43.070
 best way possible you did not get in 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:46.510
 very cold Norwegian winter 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:50.989
 how was the change for you and so much 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:53.809
 let's say in the weather part and then the 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:57.010
 culture and that part and good the truth 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:59.960
 that it was quite difficult not because 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:02.150
 imagine us 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.760
 I am Paraguayan no and in Paraguay 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:07.400
 the heat does not predominate so I was 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:10.250
 complicated enough it was very difficult but 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.870
 well I think I could adapt quickly or 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:12.560
 be much faster than I am 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:14.270
 I expected 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.710
 to what is the weather what is the 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.720
 culture what is the language here in 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.790
 norway we know that it is totally 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:23.119
 different from what culture is for 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:26.610
 good and the truth is that I could adapt 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:30.870
 successful and I'm very happy about that 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:33.990
 also to the football side a 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:35.900
 very big change the South American soccer 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.900
 and the football 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:42.500
 let's say north European yes the truth that 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:44.660
 it's quite complicated, not because we know 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:47.420
 that South American football dominates the 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:49.100
 good touch predominates not and 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:53.180
 here totally different not here 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:54.400
 the predominant force predominates 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:57.700
 is 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:59.800
 running after the ball predominates that does not and 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:02.080
 the truth that at first the first 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.640
 matches cost me quite not but good 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.950
 with the 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:09.040
 with the passing of the matches I went 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:10.899
 adapting and really now I am 

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:14.040
 very satisfied with the level that I am 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:16.469
 that I acquired during matches 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:19.430
 has had quite good success here with 

00:02:16.469 --> 00:02:23.250
 the team the team loves you very much 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:25.349
 we have also seen that you have 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:28.099
 tried a new position that 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:30.989
 previously you played it if you really 

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:32.970
 it was thanks to the technician who decided 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:36.030
 prove me midfielder midfielder 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:38.549
 central and the truth that I liked 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.829
 very much that position I have stayed 

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:43.319
 played more than half the screw in 

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:45.870
 that position and I think I've done it 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:49.290
 the best way and here they have paid me back 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:51.659
 with good compliments 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.200
 my actions in this position and the 

00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:54.910
 true that 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.250
 I would like to continue playing from that 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:58.510
 position and I think I can improve a lot 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:01.420
 plus 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:03.930
 talking about the future what plans are there for 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:07.000
 the good future really here 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:09.700
 just in this these past days I 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.560
 have commented on the interest to renew 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:13.490
 renew contract with me for the next 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:17.630
 season no 

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:19.820
 and analyze it well think about cold 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:22.250
 they started the holidays before and then 

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:25.420
 come back with more desire 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:28.700
 the interest of Italian team but 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:31.060
 I really still do not know what will be of 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:31.060
 my future
