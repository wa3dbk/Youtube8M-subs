doesn't have a zippered compartment so

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.350 
doesn't have a zippered compartment so
they<00:01:49.590> actually<00:01:50.070> change<00:01:50.399> the<00:01:50.670> design<00:01:50.820> of<00:01:51.060> the

Kylie a little bit from the previous

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.780 
Kylie a little bit from the previous
ones<00:01:53.689> but<00:01:54.689> it<00:01:54.899> still<00:01:55.259> really<00:01:55.920> lovely<00:01:56.399> from<00:01:56.670> the

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
ones but it still really lovely from the

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.230 
ones but it still really lovely from the
outside<00:01:57.240> it's<00:01:57.509> exactly<00:01:58.110> the<00:01:58.259> same<00:01:58.500> and

outside it's exactly the same and
they're<00:02:00.240> pretty<00:02:00.450> identical<00:02:01.049> as<00:02:02.009> you<00:02:02.159> can<00:02:02.310> see

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:05.870 
they're pretty identical as you can see
they're<00:02:03.990> actually<00:02:04.110> not<00:02:04.560> that<00:02:04.799> heavy<00:02:05.009> either<00:02:05.430> I

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
they're actually not that heavy either I

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.670 
they're actually not that heavy either I
think<00:02:06.000> they're<00:02:06.450> lighter<00:02:06.689> than<00:02:07.049> the<00:02:07.290> Rebecca

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
think they're lighter than the Rebecca

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.400 
think they're lighter than the Rebecca
Minkoff<00:02:08.129> mini<00:02:08.459> max<00:02:08.729> so<00:02:09.720> they're<00:02:09.929> quite<00:02:10.140> easy

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
Minkoff mini max so they're quite easy

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.650 
Minkoff mini max so they're quite easy
to<00:02:10.530> wear<00:02:10.830> and<00:02:11.069> the<00:02:11.430> strap<00:02:11.940> is

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
to wear and the strap is

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.310 
to wear and the strap is
really<00:02:13.260> long<00:02:13.700> so<00:02:14.700> as<00:02:15.570> you<00:02:15.750> when<00:02:15.930> you<00:02:16.050> wear<00:02:16.230> it

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
really long so as you when you wear it

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.920 
really long so as you when you wear it
as<00:02:16.410> a<00:02:16.440> crossbody<00:02:16.940> it<00:02:17.940> actually<00:02:18.390> sits<00:02:18.720> around

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
as a crossbody it actually sits around

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.080 
as a crossbody it actually sits around
your<00:02:19.290> hip<00:02:19.470> which<00:02:20.040> is<00:02:20.250> the<00:02:20.400> perfect<00:02:20.580> length<00:02:20.940> for

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
your hip which is the perfect length for

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.130 
your hip which is the perfect length for
me<00:02:21.650> this<00:02:22.650> blossom<00:02:23.190> one<00:02:23.430> comes<00:02:24.150> in<00:02:24.540> silver

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
me this blossom one comes in silver

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.460 
me this blossom one comes in silver
hardware<00:02:25.770> with<00:02:26.280> a<00:02:26.310> silver<00:02:26.730> tag<00:02:27.330> there<00:02:27.660> whilst

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
hardware with a silver tag there whilst

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.970 
hardware with a silver tag there whilst
the<00:02:28.890> standalone<00:02:29.790> one<00:02:30.150> is<00:02:30.330> gold<00:02:30.600> I<00:02:30.930> think<00:02:31.770> the

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
the standalone one is gold I think the

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.370 
the standalone one is gold I think the
yellow<00:02:32.340> suits<00:02:32.820> the<00:02:33.000> gold<00:02:33.210> a<00:02:33.330> lot<00:02:33.510> more<00:02:33.750> and<00:02:33.960> the

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
yellow suits the gold a lot more and the

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.290 
yellow suits the gold a lot more and the
pink<00:02:34.620> suits<00:02:34.890> the<00:02:35.040> silver<00:02:35.460> so<00:02:35.700> I<00:02:35.730> think<00:02:35.880> Marc

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
pink suits the silver so I think Marc

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.990 
pink suits the silver so I think Marc
does<00:02:36.510> a<00:02:36.570> good<00:02:36.720> job<00:02:36.780> with<00:02:36.990> those<00:02:37.370> but<00:02:38.370> overall

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
does a good job with those but overall

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.870 
does a good job with those but overall
they're<00:02:39.270> really<00:02:39.660> nice<00:02:39.870> and<00:02:40.320> the<00:02:40.620> leather<00:02:40.830> is<00:02:41.610> I

bit<00:03:06.810> bigger<00:03:07.050> but<00:03:07.980> that's<00:03:08.190> only<00:03:08.400> because<00:03:08.610> it's

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
bit bigger but that's only because it's

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.590

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:37.710 
so the little bags are much more

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:39.110 
so the little bags are much more
suitable<00:03:38.460> for<00:03:38.640> me
