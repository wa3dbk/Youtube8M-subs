00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:09.490
 I would like to replace the drainage line 

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:09.910
 Please buy not to make a mistake in size This kind of bus 8 heat depending on the installation place 

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:15.370
 Hmm 

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:19.539
 After, please Meka' not forget this you need these things the driver and the add 

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:20.690
 Pliers for glancing from be a or cutting the chain 

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:21.550
 Please prepare it 

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:24.280
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:28.300
 A dedicated place for this 

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:31.170
 First of all, I will check if it matches 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.170
 Hey eye size 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:41.370
 But in this case the cause is a bit long 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:41.370
 The chain will try to challenge because it is long 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:50.170
 First remove the ring 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:50.170
 It becomes such a metal fitting 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:03.720
 Spread in a pinch like this If you measure its length 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:03.720
 It does not cut with pliers 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:18.240
 This Masu caulking firmly with pliers 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:28.289
 Ru This fixed system terminates the delay to the appropriate place 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:34.030
 Hmm 

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:39.479
 Now that the chain is properly cut, it's not too long and easy to use 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:39.479
 It is experimented whether it will not be allowed to put water after this and weight lesbian 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:53.360
 If you paste water to some extent, you can close it and save it. 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:55.340
 If it doesn't sound that it is leaking from the drainage pipe, it's a normal lesbian 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:58.380
 Well I put some water 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:00.670
 Please check if such water tightness 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:04.420
 There is also a sink with this 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:06.420
 The cap can be repaired 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.420
 Hmm 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:19.459
 It is not even trying to be another flow of is appropriate in the case of recommendation of off 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:24.780
 Make sure that the gap fits properly Then screw a screw into each hole 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:31.280
 At this time, if it is a regular joint, this back side can not reach 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:31.280
 That this man when there is a thing called N this bus 8 heat-accessible 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:46.269
 This in and had entered Toka Do special Tteyuu that well diisocyanate this will be used to 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:49.599
 It is possible to construct easily even if the other side does not go around from this opposite side 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:51.720
 This is a very useful thing, but it is not well known 

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:53.470
 If you do not know 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:58.400
 I do not know at all 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:03:02.230
 You can only be easily occupy screwing know it here also Te' 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.230
 Push this black well nut 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:10.260
 You can then screw in this screw 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:22.340
 You can screw in while pressing 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:27.050
 Then you will be bloated instead 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:30.410
 It's another, so it's very useful, I 'll just break it down 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:33.900
 It looks like I mean it is this nut This well of taking 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:36.170
 The product name is different though it is a company paint 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:39.640
 I have listened taking Werner 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:45.030
 Lightly tighten like this and finish 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:45.030
 It is the end if the wisdom is already hooked here
