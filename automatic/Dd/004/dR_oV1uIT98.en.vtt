00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:25.890
 slightly this long eye is this one and 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:28.830
 bit length of the eye's example yah 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:34.989

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:37.390

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:38.950
 delay coverage here see what it does 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:42.370

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:02.510
 adjust our eyebrows 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:06.100
 so chose the entrance up 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.840
