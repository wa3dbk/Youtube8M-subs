00:04:12.339 --> 00:04:12.349 

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:15.140 

it's<00:04:13.349> better<00:04:13.650> if<00:04:13.829> they<00:04:13.980> don't<00:04:14.220> exist<00:04:14.579> when<00:04:15.120> I

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150 
it's better if they don't exist when I

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:17.599 
it's better if they don't exist when I
made<00:04:15.510> the<00:04:15.689> beat<00:04:15.840> above<00:04:16.079> zero<00:04:16.440> system<00:04:16.769> my<00:04:17.280> plans

00:04:21.439 --> 00:04:21.449 
before I finished them the design I

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:23.060 
before I finished them the design I
created<00:04:21.959> was<00:04:22.199> then<00:04:22.410> used<00:04:22.650> for<00:04:22.919> nefarious

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.070 
created was then used for nefarious
