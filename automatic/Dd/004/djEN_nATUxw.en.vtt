 the lapel that I have and here it is worth we have two data like these 1 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:06.979
 we do not use it and the other one does 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:10.429
 Nothing like having the two pieces of cardboard and this trophy that you have left over 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.250
 we started 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:24.689
 with the flap down 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.689
 with a little bit of glue for these three goals of his team 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:30.550
 for this one 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:32.940
 the one on the bottom and the side 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:36.430
 but which one for this amount 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:39.430
 it was one of the intercalary cities 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:43.210
 they will be the bottom of the committee 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.220
 they take another piece of cardboard 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.630
 this will be part of the time 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:52.860
 in the lapel with who will act up 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.160
 now it was just the lapel so we can do it 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:58.760
 A) Yes 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:01.610
 slowly 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:04.300
 co opera more 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:05.380
 and it's both 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:08.380
 we can not open 

00:02:09.189 --> 00:02:12.769
 posada we already have a pop and three with an opening you've seen and here we can 

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:13.719
 place 

00:02:13.719 --> 00:02:17.589
 the drawings good now let's transform it into an old desk and 

00:02:17.589 --> 00:02:19.199
 what are we going to use look 

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:24.040
 a pen with a ballpen and a spoon of the forest ones is worth the little pass 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:25.979
 here we go 

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:29.149
 with the pen drawn an inkwell on the top flap 

00:02:30.939 --> 00:02:33.939
 and next jul my plan for pencils 

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:39.539
 perfect 

00:02:39.539 --> 00:02:43.369
 make some flies with the spoon so you can place it in the blue paint 

00:02:43.369 --> 00:02:44.799
 annual 

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:47.799
 The same in the inkwell 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:52.669
 so that it looks older and used pollen also some marks and signs 

00:02:52.669 --> 00:02:54.299
 with a pen 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:57.299
 for example you can make an outcome already 

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:02.999
 tepco 

00:03:02.999 --> 00:03:04.300
 red now 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:06.639
 place the paper in the center of the desk 

00:03:06.639 --> 00:03:09.639
 and draw its outline 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:16.309
 carefully 

00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:18.859
 cook said 

00:03:18.859 --> 00:03:20.489
 oo 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:24.359
 good but we have a little old seen and notice that the details 

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:26.560
 Makes it look like it's been many years 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.939
 Now we are going to paint and the improvement in acrylic paint or tempera 

00:03:29.939 --> 00:03:32.939
 so grab those we started 

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:37.640
 To paint the desk you can use the brown color 

00:03:40.309 --> 00:03:43.309
 I have a little 

00:03:44.869 --> 00:03:47.869
 mix different tones to give it a fashionable look 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:52.260
 as well 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.260
 you can paint in black so you deserve more assets 

00:03:58.359 --> 00:04:01.219
 no 5 

00:04:01.219 --> 00:04:04.219
 or state 

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:08.909
 and you do not have to paint the rectangle in the middle 

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:17.629
 Well, it's already dry 

00:04:17.629 --> 00:04:20.629
 and imitated the color of the wood using different shades of brown 

00:04:20.629 --> 00:04:24.340
 money that later with another number I have reviewed the marks 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:27.930
 and also with the same marker in fact these wood flies is worth for 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:30.810
 it seems authentic now I make you the center with what 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:31.800
 Well, very simple 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:35.340
 with the covers of the hard books you've seen you're here or for example this 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:38.479
 stage that you find for example the back of the notebooks of 

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:42.479
 drawings because it goes to shreds because it is perfect to lean on and draw or 

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:46.330
 paint much better nothing when you have located we can continue with our 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:48.330
 desk 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:51.110
 drawing as if it were an open book 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:54.110
 let's start with a line in half 

00:04:55.029 --> 00:04:58.029
 With some curves that are the open pages 

00:05:00.009 --> 00:05:02.009
 the stripes on the sides 

00:05:02.009 --> 00:05:05.020
 A) Yes 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:08.020
 not that 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:13.860
 Now that you paint it with acrylic paint or you find yourself in a mirror 

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:18.340
 if you want you can also mix a little cola with the paint 

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:21.340
 for this a hard finish when sitting 

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:24.270
 I doubt 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:27.750
 product completing the book with the paint mixture 

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:36.230
 Nothing here we have it and look at the last details 

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:37.819
 the royal cema 

00:05:37.819 --> 00:05:41.840
 now we have to paste on the desk here in the center very well squeezing 

00:05:41.839 --> 00:05:47.499
 with force tehran will go we have our desktop you like the monitor 

00:05:47.499 --> 00:05:49.599
 extreme is a folder because 

00:05:49.599 --> 00:05:51.059
 we open it 

00:05:51.059 --> 00:05:53.069
 and we have our drawings inside 

00:05:53.069 --> 00:05:56.539
 And it also has a double function because here we can paint and draw and 

00:05:56.539 --> 00:06:00.419
 write everything we want that we have as a point and it will happen 

00:06:01.099 --> 00:06:04.300
 now it's your turn to write writers like these are worth we're still here 

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:07.300
 in altata 

00:06:10.169 --> 00:06:11.659
 1 the psoe 

00:06:11.659 --> 00:06:15.860
 the cable was complicated but it is that you can use cardboard boxes that is 

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:17.939

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:35.720
 vega the other piece of enzymatic cardboard half of the room passed 

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:41.550
