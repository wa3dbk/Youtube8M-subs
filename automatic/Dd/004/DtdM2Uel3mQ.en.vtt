00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:25.289
 hello so here are the news s loeb 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:25.289
 meaning 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:35.630
 as usual a normal pouch 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:37.090
 with the famous is this lack the 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:41.750
 here is 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:45.260
 so as usual the little 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:47.809
 label that lets you see how you 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:51.280
 shoe cell but that without 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:58.220
 label is easy enough here you go 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:59.180
 so here is this the absence with the 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:04.400
 little islam logo 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:14.770
 they are super super the germs they are 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:24.020
 fattened paper in if the shoe 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:30.470
 here is superb with here kinds of 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:33.830
 arrows and inside the com spell 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:37.130
 com of carbon so I do not know if 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:40.550
 that's if it's really carbon or 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:44.280
 what but in any case where to touch that has 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:49.080
 look kind of plastic 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:51.229
 here we do not know too much except that 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:54.000
 the rear 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:56.640
 normally I think the pebbles do not 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.070
 can not go by big fat 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.649
 but I think they're net thickness 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:04.310
 so much is so china that the 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:07.789
 pebble do not I think can not go in 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:10.679
 but hey that will be in my test 

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:13.910
 here we can see a superb 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:20.310
 shoes so there all in one piece 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:24.930
 there stuck stuck here no no seams 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:31.790
 sewing on his salomon is very strong at 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:38.150
 the front the small logo salomon lab with 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:39.890
 a very solid bed there it does not bend 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:42.150
 you can go 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:53.060
 no problem all this part there 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:53.060
 are like the xt what else to say 

00:02:55.549 --> 00:03:06.780
 inside here there 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:09.810
 lang is a tongue is glued and 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:12.480
 paco loved him and made a whole with 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:15.440
 their shoes and that makes that when we 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:18.690
 circle you see this little eye is here 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:22.920
 the problem of this little eye and that's 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:29.490
 that on the xt is a tendency to that 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:32.970
 rubs on the heel finally excuse me 

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:37.800
 not the heel the lot of the ankle and 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:44.460
 injured so it gets that into its 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:47.580
 ranks it's going to come in there and your 

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:51.960
 heel he is on the part of the tongue 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:55.140
 is here instead of being directly with 

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:59.210
 the eye and we can see the difference 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:04:05.490
 with a lab a room in the lab world 

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:09.150
 normal a hymn xt there you have the eye 

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:11.940
 and that is directly with the skin and 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:18.530
 there is no task there is no 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:22.710
 the task with with the party 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:24.180
 that's if you see well here that's where 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:27.930
 you have the tongue that does not 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:32.880
 at all part the shoe on the 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:37.110
 sides but here you've done everything 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:39.650
 part of the same shoe and so the 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:43.190
 tongue is really glued to the eye and 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:48.910
 so what avoids the questions 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:52.200
 so that's savage 

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:55.780
 simple inside nothing special 

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:58.990
 outside that it sticks or in title that 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:02.890
 philippe colomb exceptional then me 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:03.640
 I wear games wear soles 

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:09.250
 when the actress 

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:12.300
 so I do not know if it will go it 

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:17.010
 puts normally submitted in the east 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:21.010
 as you see a re living lab xlpe 

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:25.930
 I have soles and soles 

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:28.260
 orthopedic to run so if we 

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:31.860
 look 

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:35.670
 normally it should come back with but 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:41.110
 with the same the same week 

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:44.740
 so we should not hurt at all I wear 

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:46.600
 that to imitate the famous so the 

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:49.120
 united stand of the bridle for 

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:51.280
 which sisters here you go 

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:57.450
 well listen I'm going to try 

00:05:51.280 --> 00:06:00.400
 all this my news is this the absence 

00:05:57.450 --> 00:06:03.490
 beautiful we can do a little 

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:04.380
 comparison with the two here is one 

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:07.390
 is more red 

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:12.850
 I 'm sure to be cranking about 

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:15.790
 comets see we took over the same to 

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:19.840
 almost all the same but we see that 

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:22.120
 really there it's formula 1 and there 

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:24.160
 we have more the shoe in training 

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:28.360
 and choose the really competitive 

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:30.430
 for the for the full output and the 

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:31.690
 more for training or so for 

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:34.330
 the really long outings 

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:38.110
 I have in the council I think more the xt 

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:41.470
 but I will test the lily lab to see 

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:44.910
 a little difference here we can see 

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:48.400
 so he can filter finally it's more 

00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:52.590
 it's more aesthetic 

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:52.590
 see you later
