00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:10.559
 Hello everyone 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.780
 Today we will prepare the puffs shortbread 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:19.619
 let's see how I need one 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:27.560
 pot of water and salt we carry 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:30.210
 boiling the water is boiling 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:33.180
 add the semolina in this way 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:41.610
 turning always adds by adding the 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:50.010
 semolina slowly and come a compound 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:52.760
 of the kind with ready semolina we put it 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.760
 in the car 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:57.620
 let the car go for some 

00:00:55.519 --> 00:01:00.820
 minute so that we give time to 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:00.820
 lady to cool down 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.240
 our cooled theme 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.610
 add the rest of the ingredients 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:18.259
 so the ricotta is in order 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:18.259
 they begin to mix slowly 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:28.460
 when the ricotta has been absorbed 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:32.710
 from the semolina we add the sugar with 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.710
 two drops of liquid cinnamon flavoring 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:42.580
 ok ready let's add the orange cubes 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:52.810
 our compound is ready we prepare 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.810
 our forms 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:58.760
 then we need some 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:02:02.090
 flour the basic pastry the morbini 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:05.590
 I love the shortcrust pastry 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:09.340
 remember to always keep it in the fridge 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.340
 let's make balls 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.959
 once had our forms by a 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:22.470
 council to tear the vast in 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:25.030
 this way 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:28.450
 this allows the dough to take one 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:31.620
 certain elasticity we repeat the operation 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.620
 for all the balls 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:45.159
 our balls are ready to be 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:47.390
 extended we add a little flour 

00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:52.299
 we have a slight crush with the 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:52.299
 hands and help each other with a rolling pin 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:17.310
 we are ready take a sac Ã  poche e 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:21.720
 we fill it with our compound it 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:24.720
 we cut if we use the spout 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:26.909
 it's easy that the candied orange cubes 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:29.989
 can unlock in the 

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:33.439
 hood this way didn't happen 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:33.439
 and we fill 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:44.400
 let's close so we crush the 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:44.400
 edges 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:51.510
 mashers well so that not 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:54.019
 we allow the mixture to come out 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:54.019
 in cooking 

00:03:56.909 --> 00:04:06.660
 take a baking sheet with baking paper 

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:09.920
 a pastry cutter we are going to eliminate the 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:09.920
 shortcrust pastry was excess 

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:17.209
 we give a crush with the finger and le 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.209
 close 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:33.870
 our forces are ready have had 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:36.000
 this form below so that in 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:38.219
 cooking then do not open and the mixture 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.729
 does not come out 

00:04:38.219 --> 00:04:44.909
 let's take a beaten egg 

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:47.729
 brush and polish the surface 

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:49.680
 of our shortbreads the final appearance 

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:53.099
 vocal areas as I said before also 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:55.020
 from ricotta the richer ricotta more 

00:04:53.099 --> 00:04:56.669
 the shortbread tends to crush in 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:59.550
 drier cooking instead more 

00:04:56.669 --> 00:05:08.190
 keep this original formula on 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:11.810
 oven is ready 200 degrees know in the oven 

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:11.810
 for about 40 minutes 

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:26.370
 at pleasure we can decorate them with a little 

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:28.590
 of icing sugar 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:32.840
 in this case but cannot be 

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:32.840
 throw also not hot but hot 

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:39.610
 and good appetite
