00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.219 
to shake it or it will just separate
which<00:02:02.729> tunnel<00:02:03.060> and<00:02:03.360> that's<00:02:03.810> just<00:02:03.960> disgusting

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
which tunnel and that's just disgusting

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.530 
which tunnel and that's just disgusting
and<00:02:04.740> in<00:02:05.159> the<00:02:05.250> past<00:02:05.280> and<00:02:05.700> I<00:02:05.850> was<00:02:06.000> squeeze<00:02:06.270> tube

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
and in the past and I was squeeze tube

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.839 
and in the past and I was squeeze tube
that's<00:02:06.750> hard<00:02:07.049> to<00:02:07.170> do<00:02:07.320> so<00:02:08.310> what<00:02:08.399> this<00:02:08.610> looks

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
that's hard to do so what this looks

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:12.090 
that's hard to do so what this looks
like<00:02:08.940> and<00:02:09.709> again<00:02:10.709> it's<00:02:10.979> just

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.100 
like and again it's just

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.190 
like and again it's just
it<00:02:12.490> looks<00:02:12.820> like<00:02:13.030> it's<00:02:13.210> so<00:02:13.390> opaque<00:02:13.750> but<00:02:14.050> it's

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
it looks like it's so opaque but it's

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.620 
it looks like it's so opaque but it's
just<00:02:14.500> not<00:02:14.560> doing<00:02:14.890> anything<00:02:15.360> to<00:02:16.360> cover

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630 
just not doing anything to cover

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:18.750 
just not doing anything to cover
anything<00:02:16.990> like<00:02:17.260> even<00:02:17.470> if<00:02:17.800> it<00:02:17.890> was<00:02:18.040> covering<00:02:18.550> it

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
anything like even if it was covering it

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.000 
anything like even if it was covering it
and<00:02:18.880> it<00:02:19.090> just<00:02:19.120> looked<00:02:19.540> ridiculously<00:02:20.350> to<00:02:20.740> light

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
and it just looked ridiculously to light

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:23.670 
and it just looked ridiculously to light
I<00:02:21.310> could<00:02:21.580> deal<00:02:21.820> with<00:02:22.000> that<00:02:22.170> but<00:02:23.170> it's<00:02:23.530> not

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
I could deal with that but it's not

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.620 
I could deal with that but it's not
covering<00:02:24.340> my<00:02:24.520> dark<00:02:24.730> circles<00:02:24.910> is<00:02:25.210> also<00:02:25.510> it's

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
covering my dark circles is also it's

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:29.850 
covering my dark circles is also it's
kind<00:02:25.840> of<00:02:25.900> pointless<00:02:27.120> so<00:02:28.120> I'm<00:02:28.420> not<00:02:28.600> really<00:02:28.660> um<00:02:29.470> I

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
kind of pointless so I'm not really um I

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:32.040 
kind of pointless so I'm not really um I
wouldn't<00:02:30.430> recommend<00:02:30.640> these<00:02:30.970> I<00:02:31.240> don't<00:02:31.480> I<00:02:31.660> mean

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.050 
wouldn't recommend these I don't I mean

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:34.650 
wouldn't recommend these I don't I mean
I<00:02:32.140> guess<00:02:32.320> if<00:02:32.500> you<00:02:32.650> have<00:02:33.330> you<00:02:34.330> don't<00:02:34.510> really

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
I guess if you have you don't really

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:36.390 
I guess if you have you don't really
have<00:02:34.900> dark<00:02:35.200> dark<00:02:35.440> circles<00:02:35.920> and<00:02:36.070> this<00:02:36.250> would

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
have dark dark circles and this would

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.640 
have dark dark circles and this would
these<00:02:36.640> would<00:02:36.820> be<00:02:37.000> a<00:02:37.030> okay<00:02:37.960> i<00:02:37.990> guess<00:02:38.320> but<00:02:38.590> i

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
these would be a okay i guess but i

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:42.120 
these would be a okay i guess but i
don't<00:02:38.890> really<00:02:39.190> understand<00:02:40.180> why<00:02:40.770> you<00:02:41.770> would<00:02:42.100> go

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130 
don't really understand why you would go

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:43.860 
don't really understand why you would go
out<00:02:42.400> of<00:02:42.520> your<00:02:42.640> way<00:02:42.700> because<00:02:43.000> this<00:02:43.510> is<00:02:43.660> really

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
out of your way because this is really

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.370 
out of your way because this is really
hard<00:02:44.170> to<00:02:44.260> find<00:02:44.530> especially<00:02:45.030> where<00:02:46.030> i<00:02:46.060> live<00:02:46.480> the

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380 
hard to find especially where i live the

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:50.550 
hard to find especially where i live the
hard<00:02:47.740> candy<00:02:47.950> and<00:02:48.400> they<00:02:48.760> don't<00:02:48.880> even<00:02:49.120> sell<00:02:49.720> this

have found that the yellow though can be

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:10.560 
have found that the yellow though can be
used<00:03:08.650> for<00:03:08.830> some<00:03:09.130> of<00:03:09.220> my<00:03:09.370> foundations<00:03:10.270> that<00:03:10.420> are
