he<00:01:04.049> got<00:01:04.199> this<00:01:04.350> flash<00:01:04.589> back<00:01:04.830> just<00:01:05.040> because<00:01:05.100> he

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
he got this flash back just because he

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:06.950 
he got this flash back just because he
was<00:01:05.400> really<00:01:05.640> good<00:01:05.820> with<00:01:05.970> kicks<00:01:06.299> and<00:01:06.479> punts<00:01:06.750> I

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
was really good with kicks and punts I

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.920
