00:00:00.269 --> 00:00:05.029 

so<00:00:00.870> we<00:00:01.050> solved<00:00:01.470> the<00:00:01.590> mystery<00:00:01.949> I<00:00:02.270> believe<00:00:04.039> from

00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:05.039 
so we solved the mystery I believe from

00:00:05.039 --> 00:00:09.560 
so we solved the mystery I believe from
these<00:00:05.640> JS<00:00:05.879> /<00:00:06.209> polemic<00:00:06.749> 6<00:00:07.229> to<00:00:07.319> 6<00:00:08.330> so<00:00:09.330> I<00:00:09.360> just

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
these JS / polemic 6 to 6 so I just

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.060 
these JS / polemic 6 to 6 so I just
pulled<00:00:09.780> the<00:00:09.959> valve<00:00:10.139> cover<00:00:10.379> and<00:00:10.530> this<00:00:10.919> thing

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
pulled the valve cover and this thing

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.110 
pulled the valve cover and this thing
looks<00:00:11.099> brand-spanking-new

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:14.120 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:19.060 

there's<00:00:15.120> no<00:00:15.299> traces<00:00:15.749> of<00:00:15.900> buildup<00:00:16.800> or<00:00:17.160> I<00:00:17.430> mean

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:19.070 
there's no traces of buildup or I mean

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:23.620 
there's no traces of buildup or I mean
this<00:00:20.070> thing<00:00:20.310> looks<00:00:20.550> brand-new

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:23.630 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:27.019 

yeah<00:00:24.630> what<00:00:25.470> I<00:00:25.500> believe<00:00:25.920> this<00:00:26.189> is<00:00:26.519> a<00:00:26.550> very<00:00:26.670> low

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
yeah what I believe this is a very low

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.169 
yeah what I believe this is a very low
mileage<00:00:27.500> motor<00:00:28.500> I<00:00:28.830> mean<00:00:29.609> you<00:00:29.820> look<00:00:29.970> at<00:00:30.060> the

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
mileage motor I mean you look at the

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.100 
mileage motor I mean you look at the
casting<00:00:30.750> and<00:00:30.929> it's<00:00:31.019> not<00:00:31.199> even<00:00:31.439> like<00:00:32.990> yellow<00:00:33.990> it

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
casting and it's not even like yellow it

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.020 
casting and it's not even like yellow it
out<00:00:34.230> or<00:00:34.440> anything<00:00:34.590> even<00:00:34.830> if<00:00:35.070> you<00:00:35.190> were<00:00:35.310> to<00:00:35.370> hot

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
out or anything even if you were to hot

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.540 
out or anything even if you were to hot
tank<00:00:36.330> this<00:00:36.510> head<00:00:36.950> it<00:00:37.950> when<00:00:38.100> they<00:00:38.220> were<00:00:38.280> like

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
tank this head it when they were like

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.580 
tank this head it when they were like
especially<00:00:39.480> the<00:00:39.690> cams<00:00:39.960> I<00:00:40.140> don't<00:00:40.320> think<00:00:40.470> that

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
especially the cams I don't think that

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.490 
especially the cams I don't think that
somebody<00:00:40.890> had<00:00:41.250> tainted<00:00:41.670> the<00:00:41.820> cams<00:00:42.120> you<00:00:42.270> know

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:42.500 
somebody had tainted the cams you know

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.160 
somebody had tainted the cams you know
you<00:00:43.500> can<00:00:43.650> look<00:00:43.770> at<00:00:43.860> the<00:00:43.920> cam<00:00:44.130> gears<00:00:44.490> I<00:00:45.170> mean

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
you can look at the cam gears I mean

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.020 
you can look at the cam gears I mean
they<00:00:46.290> look<00:00:46.620> silver<00:00:47.460> not<00:00:47.790> yellow<00:00:48.030> silver<00:00:48.600> oh

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.030 
they look silver not yellow silver oh

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:57.350 
they look silver not yellow silver oh
well<00:00:51.030> there's<00:00:51.240> a<00:00:51.300> time<00:00:51.480> but<00:00:53.840> yeah<00:00:56.150> it<00:00:57.150> looks

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
well there's a time but yeah it looks

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.090 
well there's a time but yeah it looks
all<00:00:57.510> right<00:00:57.540> and<00:00:58.940> the<00:00:59.940> kit<00:01:00.270> this<00:01:00.750> is<00:01:00.870> our<00:01:00.990> KL<00:01:01.590> 101

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
all right and the kit this is our KL 101

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:08.209 
all right and the kit this is our KL 101
heads<00:01:02.750> if<00:01:03.750> you<00:01:03.870> can<00:01:03.990> see<00:01:04.259> it<00:01:04.350> right<00:01:04.739> there<00:01:07.219> this

00:01:08.209 --> 00:01:08.219 
heads if you can see it right there this

00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:12.260 
heads if you can see it right there this
is<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.369> rear<00:01:08.640> head<00:01:08.820> oh<00:01:11.060> yeah

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
is the rear head oh yeah

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:18.640 
is the rear head oh yeah
there's<00:01:12.479> definite<00:01:12.929> KL<00:01:13.560> motor

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:18.650 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:25.310 

there<00:01:19.650> we<00:01:19.770> go<00:01:20.360> and<00:01:21.920> no<00:01:22.920> vintag<00:01:23.990> and<00:01:24.990> I<00:01:25.080> looked

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
there we go and no vintag and I looked

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.750 
there we go and no vintag and I looked
in<00:01:25.440> the<00:01:25.530> holes<00:01:25.710> I<00:01:25.920> not<00:01:26.070> drilled<00:01:26.400> out<00:01:26.610> or

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:26.760 
in the holes I not drilled out or

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:32.810 
in the holes I not drilled out or
anything<00:01:27.890> so<00:01:30.020> it's<00:01:31.020> a<00:01:31.170> JVM<00:01:31.560> block<00:01:31.950> so<00:01:32.580> it's

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
anything so it's a JVM block so it's

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.280 
anything so it's a JVM block so it's
gotta<00:01:33.000> be<00:01:33.060> one<00:01:33.270> of<00:01:33.300> those<00:01:33.420> weird<00:01:33.720> millennia

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
gotta be one of those weird millennia

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.700 
gotta be one of those weird millennia
JTA<00:01:34.680> motors<00:01:35.100> they<00:01:35.730> came<00:01:35.970> with<00:01:36.150> the<00:01:36.710> slightly

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
JTA motors they came with the slightly

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.630 
JTA motors they came with the slightly
higher<00:01:37.890> compression<00:01:38.370> distance<00:01:39.240> than<00:01:39.540> the<00:01:39.570> V

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:40.640 
higher compression distance than the V

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.080 
higher compression distance than the V
and<00:01:41.840> look<00:01:42.840> at<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:43.050> jerk<00:01:43.790> really<00:01:44.790> strange

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
and look at the jerk really strange

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:52.490 
and look at the jerk really strange
easier<00:01:50.210> so<00:01:51.210> we<00:01:51.510> believe<00:01:51.690> this<00:01:51.930> problem<00:01:52.290> for<00:01:52.410> my

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
easier so we believe this problem for my

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.020 
easier so we believe this problem for my
Z<00:01:52.800> those<00:01:52.979> nine<00:01:55.010> from<00:01:56.010> somewhere<00:01:56.430> overseas

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
Z those nine from somewhere overseas

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.840 
Z those nine from somewhere overseas
so<00:01:57.900> yeah<00:01:58.020> the<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.200> EGR<00:01:58.979> is<00:01:59.280> actually<00:01:59.610> hooked

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
so yeah the the EGR is actually hooked

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.550 
so yeah the the EGR is actually hooked
up<00:02:00.060> to<00:02:00.270> the<00:02:00.650> attached<00:02:01.650> to<00:02:01.920> the<00:02:02.100> to<00:02:02.520> the<00:02:02.640> head

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
up to the attached to the to the head

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:10.859 
up to the attached to the to the head
instead<00:02:04.560> of<00:02:04.619> the<00:02:04.740> manifold

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:10.869 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:13.699 

and<00:02:11.319> I'll<00:02:11.590> show<00:02:11.800> you<00:02:11.830> the<00:02:12.099> money<00:02:12.550> fold<00:02:12.819> ahead

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 
and I'll show you the money fold ahead

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:18.390 
and I'll show you the money fold ahead
with<00:02:14.709> hgr<00:02:15.280> it's<00:02:15.430> actually<00:02:15.670> blocked<00:02:15.940> off<00:02:17.400> it's

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
with hgr it's actually blocked off it's

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.949 
with hgr it's actually blocked off it's
obviously<00:02:18.849> you<00:02:19.030> know<00:02:19.150> curved<00:02:19.480> Nick<00:02:21.810> and<00:02:22.810> it's

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959 
obviously you know curved Nick and it's

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:25.680 
obviously you know curved Nick and it's
got<00:02:23.110> a<00:02:23.140> green<00:02:23.470> JC<00:02:23.980> printed<00:02:24.700> or<00:02:24.790> lowered<00:02:25.120> so<00:02:25.660> I

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
got a green JC printed or lowered so I

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.770 
got a green JC printed or lowered so I
don't<00:02:25.930> know<00:02:25.989> maybe<00:02:26.230> those<00:02:26.319> are<00:02:26.530> the<00:02:26.650> importers

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
don't know maybe those are the importers

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.360 
don't know maybe those are the importers
there<00:02:28.780> it<00:02:28.900> is<00:02:29.019> whatever<00:02:29.590> that<00:02:29.890> means

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
there it is whatever that means

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:36.509 
there it is whatever that means
things<00:02:30.610> JC<00:02:31.000> something<00:02:33.269> yeah<00:02:34.269> most<00:02:34.660> likely<00:02:35.519> so

00:02:36.509 --> 00:02:36.519 
things JC something yeah most likely so

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:39.600 
things JC something yeah most likely so
that's<00:02:36.700> where<00:02:36.879> the<00:02:37.030> where<00:02:37.989> the<00:02:38.069> EGR<00:02:39.069> goes<00:02:39.430> in

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
that's where the where the EGR goes in

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:42.240 
that's where the where the EGR goes in
the<00:02:39.730> USD<00:02:40.450> and<00:02:40.569> Millennia's<00:02:41.110> and<00:02:41.530> this<00:02:42.160> is

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
the USD and Millennia's and this is

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:54.980 
the USD and Millennia's and this is
blocked<00:02:42.549> off<00:02:42.760> oh<00:02:45.690> yeah<00:02:52.110> yeah

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:54.990 
blocked off oh yeah yeah

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:57.920 
blocked off oh yeah yeah
also<00:02:55.800> if<00:02:55.890> you<00:02:56.010> look<00:02:56.130> at<00:02:56.250> the<00:02:56.340> block<00:02:56.580> itself<00:02:57.900> I

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
also if you look at the block itself I

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.010 
also if you look at the block itself I
know<00:02:58.380> I'll<00:02:58.560> have<00:02:58.590> the<00:02:58.770> flashlight<00:02:59.070> on<00:02:59.400> but

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:00.020 
know I'll have the flashlight on but

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:03.680 
know I'll have the flashlight on but
it's<00:03:01.020> it's<00:03:01.620> gum<00:03:01.980> is<00:03:02.370> very<00:03:02.730> clean<00:03:03.090> actually

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
it's it's gum is very clean actually

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:07.100
