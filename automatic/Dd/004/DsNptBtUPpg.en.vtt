00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:05.690
 Ok let's go 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:27.099
 to start I recommend 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:30.369
 to teach his foal to the riding school 

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:31.910
 it is very important that you crate it in some 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:34.570
 corral 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:37.510
 it could be 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:39.100
 somewhere where the horse is 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:42.580
 feel cornered and start working 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:44.910
 well and if you do not have some corral like 

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:44.910
 this 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:51.510
 where is there is a plane where it is not 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.890
 worry I recommend that you clarify a 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:58.340
 post like this 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:59.910
 it ties it completely leaves a shore and 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:02.870
 start up 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:05.930
 do not worry 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:07.510
 at a distance the idea that we said let's 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:10.630
 to cut the trot 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:10.630
 then it is important 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:19.360
 choose distance is one thing 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:21.160
 thereafter 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.960
 when we have the horse we are going to 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:26.700
 remove the tickle 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:26.700
 and for that we're going to address here 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:55.020
 Well I recommend you prepare a 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:59.549
 side as well as this 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:02.120
 we are long to limit sometimes 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:04.940
 some kick to some something 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:07.210
 and that's how we started to take away the 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:07.210
 tickle 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:41.810
 it's very important because this is going to 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.810
 help 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:49.280
 will receive for the handling of the legs 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.280
 close it all 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:12.790
 very important here in the ears 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.370
 but when I start flying 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:04:00.020
 and it's very important because here it's going to 

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:00.020
 go from 5 

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:04.760
 very important tickling 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:22.990
 Well now after giving 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:25.940
 It is very important that the 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:28.810
 hair starts to feel 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:28.810
 the salt shaker 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:35.460
 with a belt 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:35.460
 already so that he gets used to 

00:04:46.409 --> 00:04:54.449
 pretend that right away 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:54.449
 the people the saddle is important 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:01.770
 well there is everything that is 

00:05:00.849 --> 00:05:04.680
 Start 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:08.080
 remember let's use a cushion 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:09.910
 we start the trot after we bring it 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:12.990
 here 

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:15.160
 we tie it in a short way 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:16.870
 remember that it is very important that 

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:18.540
 be so long in case the horse wants 

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:20.560
 repair so you can not crouch 

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:22.540
 then you can cut it here from 

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:24.460
 according to 

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:27.880
 to the savages that the horse is if the 

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:31.270
 horse I think I can remember because there 

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:33.550
 to agree here to put him to try 

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:34.960
 grab him leave him tired with ours 

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:37.240
 no longer so that he starts to feel 

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:38.980
 for later simple the horse for 

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:40.770
 logic is no longer going to do anything is not going to 

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:42.690
 repair 

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:44.879
 well remember that this has it 

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:46.560
 what to do according to what you see 

00:05:44.879 --> 00:05:49.409
 who are urging your horse there 

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:51.419
 most nervous horses these are that 

00:05:49.409 --> 00:05:52.830
 give them time I understand that 

00:05:51.419 --> 00:05:54.060
 naturally nowadays 

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:56.819
 that we live many times has 

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:59.129
 commitment horses that deliver and you 

00:05:56.819 --> 00:06:01.199
 they go a little faster but if that's me 

00:05:59.129 --> 00:06:03.599
 the horse and he wanted to earn his time 

00:06:01.199 --> 00:06:05.340
 Give your time the horse is very easy 

00:06:03.599 --> 00:06:07.650
 is going to tell you how much you need if 

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:10.249
 he still feels nervous do not put him 

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:14.359
 the saddle continues to put on the saddle or 

00:06:10.249 --> 00:06:16.069
 can be eight days to the horses that with 

00:06:14.359 --> 00:06:18.559
 23 days have and the horse is going to 

00:06:16.069 --> 00:06:20.569
 occupy up to about 15 days such putting 

00:06:18.559 --> 00:06:23.479
 this so that it is not going to repair you agree 

00:06:20.569 --> 00:06:26.629
 of the idea that the horse does not know 

00:06:23.479 --> 00:06:31.029
 the repairs much better to be able 

00:06:26.629 --> 00:06:31.029
 work correctly and at ease with him
