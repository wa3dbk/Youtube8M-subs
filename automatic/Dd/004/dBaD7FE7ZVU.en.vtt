00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:07.789 

heyno<00:00:06.569> Granville<00:00:06.990> here<00:00:07.170> I<00:00:07.200> thought<00:00:07.470> for<00:00:07.649> this

00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:07.799 
heyno Granville here I thought for this

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:09.740 
heyno Granville here I thought for this
series<00:00:08.519> of<00:00:08.670> lessons<00:00:08.820> what<00:00:09.179> I<00:00:09.210> do<00:00:09.420> is<00:00:09.570> some

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
series of lessons what I do is some

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.530 
series of lessons what I do is some
quick<00:00:10.019> kind<00:00:10.349> of<00:00:10.469> test<00:00:10.889> to<00:00:11.610> see<00:00:11.790> how<00:00:12.000> well<00:00:12.300> you

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
quick kind of test to see how well you

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.829 
quick kind of test to see how well you
know<00:00:12.570> your<00:00:12.780> instrument<00:00:13.559> I<00:00:14.480> mean<00:00:15.480> that's<00:00:15.599> these

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
know your instrument I mean that's these

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.019 
know your instrument I mean that's these
aren't<00:00:16.049> necessarily<00:00:16.230> star<00:00:17.100> related<00:00:17.850> they're

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
aren't necessarily star related they're

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.179 
aren't necessarily star related they're
kind<00:00:18.270> of<00:00:18.420> more<00:00:18.600> just<00:00:18.810> how<00:00:19.320> well<00:00:19.590> do<00:00:19.830> you<00:00:19.920> know

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
kind of more just how well do you know

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.189 
kind of more just how well do you know
the<00:00:20.550> instrument<00:00:20.850> for<00:00:21.420> the<00:00:21.510> fret<00:00:21.750> board<00:00:21.779> more

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
the instrument for the fret board more

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.109 
the instrument for the fret board more
than<00:00:22.410> anything<00:00:22.650> else<00:00:22.980> so<00:00:23.220> I<00:00:23.519> thought<00:00:24.000> this

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
than anything else so I thought this

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:25.400 
than anything else so I thought this
would<00:00:24.240> be<00:00:24.269> a<00:00:24.359> good<00:00:24.600> little<00:00:24.750> seriously<00:00:25.260> I

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
would be a good little seriously I

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.439 
would be a good little seriously I
thought<00:00:25.590> I'd<00:00:25.680> do<00:00:25.769> five<00:00:26.099> of<00:00:26.369> them<00:00:26.550> covering

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
thought I'd do five of them covering

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.450 
thought I'd do five of them covering
some<00:00:27.660> sort<00:00:27.869> of<00:00:27.960> key<00:00:28.140> areas<00:00:28.529> just<00:00:28.740> to<00:00:28.859> see<00:00:29.039> where

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
some sort of key areas just to see where

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.220 
some sort of key areas just to see where
you're<00:00:29.760> at<00:00:29.910> in<00:00:30.090> terms<00:00:30.269> of<00:00:30.449> your<00:00:30.750> knowledge<00:00:31.109> of

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
you're at in terms of your knowledge of

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.500 
you're at in terms of your knowledge of
the<00:00:31.349> instrument<00:00:31.830> okay<00:00:32.640> so<00:00:32.700> this<00:00:32.910> is<00:00:33.090> the<00:00:33.239> first

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
the instrument okay so this is the first

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.500 
the instrument okay so this is the first
one<00:00:33.780> what<00:00:34.020> I'm<00:00:34.110> going<00:00:34.290> to<00:00:34.320> talk<00:00:34.500> about<00:00:34.559> is

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:35.510 
one what I'm going to talk about is

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:38.450 
one what I'm going to talk about is
scales<00:00:36.510> here<00:00:37.140> very<00:00:37.559> simple<00:00:37.950> because<00:00:38.100> it's<00:00:38.340> an

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
scales here very simple because it's an

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.310 
scales here very simple because it's an
easy<00:00:38.610> one<00:00:38.850> to<00:00:39.030> do<00:00:39.180> okay<00:00:39.870> so<00:00:39.930> what<00:00:40.140> we're<00:00:40.230> gonna

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
easy one to do okay so what we're gonna

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.799 
easy one to do okay so what we're gonna
look<00:00:40.530> at<00:00:40.739> is<00:00:40.950> the<00:00:41.280> major<00:00:41.610> scale<00:00:42.149> and<00:00:42.390> how<00:00:42.570> well

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
look at is the major scale and how well

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.959 
look at is the major scale and how well
people<00:00:42.989> know<00:00:43.320> that<00:00:43.640> start<00:00:44.640> with<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:44.789> major

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
people know that start with the major

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.729 
people know that start with the major
you<00:00:45.090> can<00:00:45.210> do<00:00:45.329> any<00:00:45.510> scale<00:00:45.870> of<00:00:46.050> course<00:00:46.289> but<00:00:46.620> this

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
you can do any scale of course but this

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.740 
you can do any scale of course but this
is<00:00:46.890> a<00:00:46.920> good<00:00:47.340> test<00:00:47.640> for<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:48.000> major<00:00:48.210> scale<00:00:48.480> now

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
is a good test for the major scale now

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.840 
is a good test for the major scale now
the<00:00:49.140> only<00:00:49.649> thing<00:00:49.829> you<00:00:49.920> have<00:00:50.070> to<00:00:50.100> do<00:00:50.370> is<00:00:50.640> to

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
the only thing you have to do is to

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.930 
the only thing you have to do is to
start<00:00:51.120> from<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.449> lowest<00:00:51.719> note<00:00:52.160> that<00:00:53.160> one<00:00:53.370> if

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
start from the lowest note that one if

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.420 
start from the lowest note that one if
it's<00:00:54.120> in<00:00:54.270> the<00:00:54.329> scowl<00:00:54.600> or<00:00:54.899> that<00:00:55.890> one<00:00:56.039> of<00:00:56.160> us<00:00:56.219> the

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
it's in the scowl or that one of us the

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.660 
it's in the scowl or that one of us the
next<00:00:56.460> and<00:00:57.090> go<00:00:57.360> through<00:00:57.570> to<00:00:57.690> here<00:00:58.370> so<00:00:59.370> any

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
next and go through to here so any

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.220 
next and go through to here so any
fingering<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:00.329> fingering<00:01:00.690> doesn't<00:01:01.050> matter

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
fingering the fingering doesn't matter

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.869 
fingering the fingering doesn't matter
in<00:01:01.410> this<00:01:01.500> instance<00:01:01.859> is<00:01:01.980> just<00:01:02.219> a<00:01:02.309> test<00:01:02.550> to<00:01:02.640> see

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
in this instance is just a test to see

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.310 
in this instance is just a test to see
can<00:01:03.359> you<00:01:03.390> go<00:01:03.570> from<00:01:03.719> the<00:01:03.870> lowest<00:01:04.049> to<00:01:04.290> the

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
can you go from the lowest to the

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.770 
can you go from the lowest to the
highest<00:01:04.409> and<00:01:04.860> a<00:01:04.979> certain<00:01:05.369> key<00:01:05.640> so<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:06.570> first

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
highest and a certain key so the first

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.750 
highest and a certain key so the first
example<00:01:06.960> I'm<00:01:07.260> going<00:01:07.350> to<00:01:07.409> give<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:07.650> C<00:01:08.010> major

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
example I'm going to give the C major

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.719 
example I'm going to give the C major
all<00:01:09.119> right<00:01:09.270> so<00:01:09.420> C<00:01:09.600> major<00:01:09.780> has<00:01:09.990> an<00:01:10.140> e<00:01:10.350> in<00:01:10.380> it<00:01:11.280> so

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
all right so C major has an e in it so

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:30.480 
all right so C major has an e in it so
can<00:01:11.880> you<00:01:11.909> play<00:01:12.090> C<00:01:12.360> major<00:01:12.390> from<00:01:12.900> here<00:01:13.140> to<00:01:13.830> here

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:30.490 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.070 

right<00:01:31.490> so<00:01:31.610> the<00:01:31.700> c-major<00:01:32.090> from<00:01:32.480> the<00:01:32.600> knee<00:01:32.780> to

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:33.080 
right so the c-major from the knee to

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.700 
right so the c-major from the knee to
the<00:01:33.620> high<00:01:33.800> B<00:01:34.100> that<00:01:34.370> I<00:01:34.400> have<00:01:34.960> available<00:01:35.960> now<00:01:36.229> of

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:36.710 
the high B that I have available now of

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:37.870 
the high B that I have available now of
course<00:01:36.920> you<00:01:37.010> want<00:01:37.160> to<00:01:37.190> be<00:01:37.310> able<00:01:37.400> to<00:01:37.490> do<00:01:37.610> this<00:01:37.700> in

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 
course you want to be able to do this in

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:39.850 
course you want to be able to do this in
all<00:01:38.000> keys<00:01:38.210> so<00:01:38.450> let's<00:01:38.630> say<00:01:38.840> and<00:01:39.380> I<00:01:39.500> know<00:01:39.620> the<00:01:39.710> key

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:39.860 
all keys so let's say and I know the key

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:48.700 
all keys so let's say and I know the key
like<00:01:39.979> F<00:01:40.130> major<00:01:46.990> it's<00:01:47.990> only<00:01:48.200> differences<00:01:48.560> that

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:48.710 
like F major it's only differences that

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:50.500 
like F major it's only differences that
would<00:01:48.860> ever<00:01:49.010> be<00:01:49.070> flat<00:01:49.460> now<00:01:49.700> there<00:01:49.970> rather<00:01:50.300> than

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:50.510 
would ever be flat now there rather than

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:52.300 
would ever be flat now there rather than
being<00:01:50.990> natural<00:01:51.470> which<00:01:51.560> we<00:01:51.680> had<00:01:51.830> with<00:01:51.950> C<00:01:52.130> major

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
being natural which we had with C major

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:54.130 
being natural which we had with C major
but<00:01:52.610> of<00:01:53.210> course<00:01:53.479> it's<00:01:53.690> gonna<00:01:53.810> be<00:01:53.960> a<00:01:53.990> little

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.140 
but of course it's gonna be a little

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:55.090 
but of course it's gonna be a little
more<00:01:54.320> challenging<00:01:54.740> because<00:01:54.860> you're<00:01:55.009> having

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:55.100 
more challenging because you're having

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.280 
more challenging because you're having
to<00:01:55.220> do<00:01:55.399> it<00:01:55.490> from<00:01:55.580> here<00:01:55.670> to<00:01:56.509> here<00:01:56.690> now<00:01:57.110> of<00:01:57.170> course

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:57.290 
to do it from here to here now of course

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:59.920 
to do it from here to here now of course
the<00:01:57.710> natural<00:01:57.860> keys<00:01:58.220> like<00:01:58.430> C<00:01:58.790> F<00:01:59.090> G<00:01:59.149> all<00:01:59.690> of<00:01:59.869> those

00:01:59.920 --> 00:01:59.930 
the natural keys like C F G all of those

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:02.830 
the natural keys like C F G all of those
are<00:02:00.140> easy<00:02:00.350> the<00:02:00.890> harder<00:02:01.280> ones<00:02:01.490> are<00:02:01.700> like<00:02:02.030> D<00:02:02.479> flat

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840 
are easy the harder ones are like D flat

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.139 
are easy the harder ones are like D flat
for<00:02:03.080> example<00:02:03.530> so<00:02:03.950> let's<00:02:04.100> do<00:02:04.220> D<00:02:04.430> flat<00:02:04.729> now<00:02:04.970> D

00:02:05.139 --> 00:02:05.149 
for example so let's do D flat now D

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:06.420 
for example so let's do D flat now D
flat<00:02:05.420> has<00:02:05.600> no<00:02:05.750> e

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:06.430 
flat has no e

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:09.999 
flat has no e
so<00:02:07.430> with<00:02:07.610> stab<00:02:07.910> from<00:02:08.170> if<00:02:09.170> you're<00:02:09.649> talking<00:02:09.800> D

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:10.009 
so with stab from if you're talking D

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:26.650 
so with stab from if you're talking D
flat<00:02:10.190> major<00:02:24.670> there's<00:02:25.670> D<00:02:25.880> flat<00:02:26.180> now<00:02:26.420> of<00:02:26.510> course

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
flat major there's D flat now of course

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.080 
flat major there's D flat now of course
do<00:02:26.930> G<00:02:27.140> flat<00:02:27.380> B<00:02:27.769> major<00:02:28.190> all<00:02:28.459> those<00:02:28.610> are<00:02:28.790> the<00:02:28.880> keys

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
do G flat B major all those are the keys

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:30.699 
do G flat B major all those are the keys
once<00:02:29.630> you<00:02:29.720> get<00:02:29.840> those<00:02:29.989> down<00:02:30.049> try<00:02:30.470> the<00:02:30.530> same

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:30.709 
once you get those down try the same

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:32.470 
once you get those down try the same
thing<00:02:30.769> with<00:02:30.950> minor<00:02:31.340> scales<00:02:31.730> the<00:02:31.910> same<00:02:32.150> thing

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
thing with minor scales the same thing

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.110 
thing with minor scales the same thing
with<00:02:33.019> melodic<00:02:33.560> minor<00:02:33.799> with<00:02:34.190> mixolydian<00:02:34.760> with

with melodic minor with mixolydian with
all<00:02:35.239> of<00:02:35.450> these<00:02:35.540> things<00:02:35.600> and<00:02:36.019> see<00:02:36.170> how<00:02:36.650> well<00:02:36.950> do

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
all of these things and see how well do

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:39.070 
all of these things and see how well do
you<00:02:37.370> actually<00:02:37.580> know<00:02:38.000> the<00:02:38.180> instrument<00:02:38.510> you'll

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:39.080 
you actually know the instrument you'll

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:40.720 
you actually know the instrument you'll
probably<00:02:39.320> find<00:02:39.650> that<00:02:39.830> there's<00:02:40.130> certain<00:02:40.519> ones

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
probably find that there's certain ones

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:42.310 
probably find that there's certain ones
that<00:02:40.940> you<00:02:41.090> can't<00:02:41.360> do<00:02:41.600> it<00:02:41.720> very<00:02:41.840> well<00:02:41.959> with

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:42.320 
that you can't do it very well with

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:44.320 
that you can't do it very well with
those<00:02:42.410> are<00:02:42.650> the<00:02:42.739> scales<00:02:43.010> to<00:02:43.250> work<00:02:43.459> on<00:02:43.610> and<00:02:43.850> just

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:44.330 
those are the scales to work on and just

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:46.509 
those are the scales to work on and just
keep<00:02:44.540> doing<00:02:44.870> it<00:02:44.959> and<00:02:45.019> tick<00:02:45.350> off<00:02:45.470> the<00:02:45.530> boxes<00:02:46.010> to

00:02:46.509 --> 00:02:46.519 
keep doing it and tick off the boxes to

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:48.580 
keep doing it and tick off the boxes to
say<00:02:46.730> that<00:02:46.880> you've<00:02:46.970> done<00:02:47.120> each<00:02:47.269> one<00:02:47.510> and<00:02:47.780> then

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
say that you've done each one and then

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.310
