00:03:47.399 --> 00:03:47.409 
second one I've got a future positioning

00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:50.129 
second one I've got a future positioning
you've<00:03:48.310> got<00:03:48.430> solid<00:03:48.669> position<00:03:48.940> being<00:03:49.810> a<00:03:49.930> good

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:50.139 
you've got solid position being a good

shot-stopper you need good positioning

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:54.330 
shot-stopper you need good positioning
otherwise<00:03:53.379> just<00:03:53.440> going<00:03:53.769> to<00:03:53.859> get<00:03:53.949> caught<00:03:54.190> out

lets the one-on-ones in unless they near
post<00:04:07.599> opie<00:04:08.169> then<00:04:08.769> it's<00:04:09.069> very<00:04:09.280> hard<00:04:09.519> for<00:04:09.609> him<00:04:09.790> to

00:04:09.809 --> 00:04:09.819 
post opie then it's very hard for him to

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:11.339 
post opie then it's very hard for him to
save<00:04:10.150> them<00:04:10.359> because<00:04:10.479> most<00:04:10.900> likely<00:04:11.259> they

00:04:11.339 --> 00:04:11.349 
save them because most likely they

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:14.610 
save them because most likely they
always<00:04:11.739> go<00:04:11.979> in<00:04:12.989> reading<00:04:13.989> of<00:04:14.109> the<00:04:14.259> game<00:04:14.439> he's
