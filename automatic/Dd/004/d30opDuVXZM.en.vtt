00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:14.860
 1000 km from Ecuador in the middle of the ocean 

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:17.230
 pacific, we spot the Galapagos or 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:19.500
 these islands of volcanic origin where 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:22.240
 Darwin developed his theory of evolution 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.580
 the presence of birds and reptiles is 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.789
 very large but what attracts us this 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:29.890
 time up here are the sea lions 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:32.410
 they came swimming and they are the mammals 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:34.450
 common in the Galapagos 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:36.610
 the sea lions develop their 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:38.530
 fundamental activity at sea but 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:40.720
 they rest on land where they form 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:43.270
 numerous colonies 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:45.670
 More than 50,000 individuals live in the 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:47.770
 archipelago on the numerous beaches 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:51.040
 females and young enter and exit the water 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:53.200
 while the males guard the harem in 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:55.840
 land are quite clumsy what does not 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:57.630
 prevents frolicking but it is in the sea where 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:00.580
 they are like wolves in the water 

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:03.620
 in the water they play fish and in 

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:05.900
 sometimes they sleep 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:09.049
 what one day they were paws today are 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:11.360
 fins the sea provides everything 

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:14.650
 that needs fish and small crustaceans 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.650
 of those who feed 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:24.939
 the sea ​​lion enjoys inside the water 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.939
 and outside sunbathing 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.340
 in the islands there are two species of 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:41.170
 sea lions 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.689
 the fur wolf that came from the waters 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:46.000
 cold just like the penguins and the 

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:49.659
 sea lion of the Galapagos the most 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.220
 abundant that came from california such 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:54.420
 that's why he loves to surf 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:54.420
 jumping on the waves 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:28.510
 the wolf is a timid animal that flees 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:30.430
 at any sign of danger as not 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:32.440
 It seems to be enemies around me 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:34.300
 I look a lot like killer whales 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:37.060
 confident despite the fact that there is a bug 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:39.520
 weird among the waves 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:43.290
 galapagos emerged from the sea 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:43.290
 sea ​​lions came swimming 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:58.900
 It's hard for me to leave these islands but 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:01.720
 new to take off I must undertake the 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:05.400
 so I could stay like a wolf 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.400
 marine surfing in the waves
