00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:06.549
 Welcome today is the theme 

00:00:04.299 --> 00:00:07.390
 wine and we will wine ourselves 

00:00:06.549 --> 00:00:10.240
 produce 

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:13.330
 But first we want to add the process 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:16.090
 the alcoholic fermentation times the 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:19.449
 Alcoholic fermentation shows us how 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:23.339
 Alcohol in wine is created 

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:23.339
 experiment with yeast and sugar 

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:35.500
 First we make a mixture 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:38.830
 water yeast and sugar we take one 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:40.170
 piston and give 20 km help to the 

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:43.000
 we took off 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.730
 we have the yeast in the water-holding well 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.120
 resolve when the help is resolved 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:50.880
 we even give it that way we have to 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:54.070
 even dissolve it 

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:56.290
 That's why we give the ball well now 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:59.220
 we have a good mix of water 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:59.220
 yeast and sugar 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.690
 we put this piston in one 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:11.510
 Water bath with a specific 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:13.910
 temperature we close the combination 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:16.760
 with a gardener ending with it 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:17.210
 Process in the piston without new accumulation 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:21.050
 can 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:23.480
 that is anna neruda process now 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:27.050
 the yeast reacts with the sugar in the 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:30.820
 The sugar turns into alcohol 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:34.550
 the carbon dioxide reacted 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:36.830
 The carbon dioxide rises and polen 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:39.920
 By this decision with the water 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:40.820
 but no air comes in thanks to the 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.580
 decision 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:46.370
 We leave the piston in five minutes 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:47.150
 basis for using the process 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:49.880
 can 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:52.220
 after the five minutes we see the 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.850
 blow we see in gerthe final 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.910
 can 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:59.350
 the bubbles are an expression of the 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:59.350
 activity in the piston 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:07.030
 we'll do the experiment a few more 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:07.900
 times but we at the sugar content and the 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.810
 temperature 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:14.380
 we all enter the results in 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:16.900
 schema and make a graf here 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:20.560
 you can see that the activity is highest 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:23.500
 when the temperature is about 45 degrees 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:28.440
 the temperature is not higher 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:28.440
 be because the help is then destroyed 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:35.849
 now until 3 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:38.129
 how to make wine at home 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:41.849
 we use our winemaking 

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:44.489
 about seven kilo blue grapes first 

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:47.310
 we remove the stems we collect the 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:51.379
 Grapes without a stalk in a big container 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.379
 that needs to be very clean 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:16.970
 after that we wash our feet 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:19.970
 need exactly those need keltern 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:24.790
 therefore came thorough there 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:24.790
 Now we have a flowing power 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:34.720
 this music turns this into a big one 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:34.720
 pot 1 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:40.750
 It is heated to 80 degrees Celsius 

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:47.350
 we use a refractometer to measure the 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:51.160
 expected alcohol content in the leg too 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:51.880
 ten for a higher alcohol percentage 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:55.270
 to reach 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:56.440
 let's add 700 grams of sugar and 

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:59.230
 often stir 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:02.590
 In the past, we saw that activity 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:07.390
 Greater sugar is now 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:09.490
 Expected alcohol percent if you're after 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:13.600
 We warmly love the wedding ceremony 

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:15.640
 shell so that we were only in matters we 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:18.010
 a victory but we of reason 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:21.489
 use on a cloth with many 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:26.350
 tiny holes of this grape me 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:28.980
 now active at 25 degrees Celsius 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:31.720
 this process can run faster 

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:36.060
 we use a special apparatus 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:36.060
 in which cold water passes through 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:46.070
 and now we are adding ingredients to it 

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:50.720
 give in sum citric acid and hinte 

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:53.890
 that we stir well around the ingredients 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:53.890
 be dissolved 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:01.919
 Now we are done with the juice and 

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:02.759
 can bottle it in a balloon 

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:05.070
 brew 

00:05:02.759 --> 00:05:07.740
 we lock the balloon too 

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:10.620
 a garden is closed with no air 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:17.430
 comes in a day later is the 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:18.750
 fermentation already used we pan 

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:21.360
 the ball well 

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:24.150
 here we see a glass in Gerthe 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:26.820
 We have to close the balloon now 

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:28.979
 long let those want the 

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:30.600
 see bottles guide then we see 

00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:33.320
 in the next episode 

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:33.320
 bye for now
