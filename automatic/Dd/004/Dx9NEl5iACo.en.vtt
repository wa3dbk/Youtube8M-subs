good enough
I<00:01:25.770> don't<00:01:26.159> know<00:01:26.250> if<00:01:26.340> the<00:01:26.460> product<00:01:26.729> itself<00:01:27.180> just

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
I don't know if the product itself just

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.520 
I don't know if the product itself just
wasn't<00:01:27.930> good<00:01:28.159> uh<00:01:29.479> it<00:01:30.479> had<00:01:30.720> to<00:01:31.049> do<00:01:31.229> it<00:01:31.380> all<00:01:31.500> over

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.950 
wasn't good uh it had to do it all over
again<00:01:31.829> I'd<00:01:32.159> still<00:01:32.430> do<00:01:32.640> it<00:01:32.820> but<00:01:33.600> I<00:01:33.630> would<00:01:33.750> have

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
again I'd still do it but I would have

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.609 
again I'd still do it but I would have
actually<00:01:34.110> probably<00:01:34.680> got<00:01:34.860> like<00:01:35.070> a<00:01:35.100> little

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:36.619 
actually probably got like a little

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:39.230 
actually probably got like a little
grinder<00:01:37.619> sand<00:01:38.189> wheel<00:01:38.400> type<00:01:38.700> of<00:01:38.880> thing<00:01:39.060> and

grinder sand wheel type of thing and

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.670 
grinder sand wheel type of thing and
really<00:01:39.590> sanded<00:01:40.590> this<00:01:40.710> down<00:01:40.979> well<00:01:41.970> I<00:01:42.600> am<00:01:43.439> still

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680

rest<00:01:48.659> of<00:01:48.840> it<00:01:48.930> off<00:01:49.049> there<00:01:49.320> to<00:01:49.439> stop<00:01:49.649> it<00:01:49.680> from

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
rest of it off there to stop it from

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.370 
rest of it off there to stop it from
flaking<00:01:50.220> and<00:01:50.549> then<00:01:51.240> I'm<00:01:51.390> going<00:01:51.630> to<00:01:51.689> go<00:01:52.020> and<00:01:52.170> add

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
flaking and then I'm going to go and add

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.020 
flaking and then I'm going to go and add
another<00:01:52.649> coat<00:01:52.950> to<00:01:53.159> it<00:01:53.250> to<00:01:53.340> see<00:01:53.549> what<00:01:53.700> I<00:01:53.729> can<00:01:53.820> do

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
another coat to it to see what I can do

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.350 
another coat to it to see what I can do
but<00:01:54.180> I<00:01:54.240> will<00:01:54.329> sand<00:01:54.780> it<00:01:54.930> very<00:01:55.290> very<00:01:55.590> much<00:01:56.360> and

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
but I will sand it very very much and

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.289 
but I will sand it very very much and
hopefully<00:01:58.460> that'll<00:01:59.460> fix<00:01:59.729> that<00:01:59.939> won't<00:02:00.119> happen

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
hopefully that'll fix that won't happen

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:03.050 
hopefully that'll fix that won't happen
again<00:02:00.540> but<00:02:01.409> I<00:02:01.439> mean<00:02:01.649> the<00:02:02.130> rest<00:02:02.430> of<00:02:02.670> it<00:02:02.820> looks

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
again but I mean the rest of it looks

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.550 
again but I mean the rest of it looks
fantastic<00:02:03.649> it<00:02:04.649> works<00:02:04.920> well<00:02:05.189> it<00:02:05.549> looks<00:02:05.729> good

fantastic it works well it looks good

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:12.500 
fantastic it works well it looks good
feels<00:02:07.560> good<00:02:07.710> underfoot<00:02:09.739> but<00:02:11.000> you<00:02:12.000> know<00:02:12.120> that

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510
