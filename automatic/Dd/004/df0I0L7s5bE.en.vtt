00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:05.330
 Well 

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:09.190
 7 

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:26.769
 during yesterday 

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:29.769
 we would wish that would not be achieved 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.449
 Bremen is 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:36.980
 I can really relax here 

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:41.800
 speak with the announced 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.130
 we do not really care about why 

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:48.230
 you will be particularly surprised there are live reports 

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:52.690
 I like it a lot to find such questions 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:57.490
 to 7 

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:00.490
 What 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.880
 Meanwhile, behind the house with lads and girls had little hearts 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:11.650
 Little picture of sick leave 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:17.800
 and so the municipalities judge and I have come to not having the banks 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:22.130
 if not now and would not have to stick to the environment soon 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:28.740
 As I said, the players Dennis Hicken and that's why not against Spiez 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.960
 A longing for German happened intelligently 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.610
 I go through the future as had a DRK 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.370
 and I do not know what's beautiful here, which is full of me 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:40.170
 stand 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.020
 Dichand's book finds that I'm not very interested in what Hahn said 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:49.900
 not so enthusiastically learning that as light in hand from 

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:51.980
 Illness and valued reading 

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:56.380
 and then I come to Marl and so Yen looked like more dishes 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:00.200
 There are so many exciting things to discover here 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.280
 and from the topics I find it very nice that here students from all 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.280
 Learning the world together 

00:02:40.779 --> 00:02:43.779
 a 

00:02:45.899 --> 00:02:46.930
 regional 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:50.189
 I'm from Lonely Economy purposefully studying 

00:02:50.189 --> 00:02:53.549
 important is that now my favorite place at the end of June in 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:56.549
 Botanical Garden 

00:02:58.219 --> 00:03:00.819
 with the bustle around him 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:03.109
 the mirror reports 

00:03:03.109 --> 00:03:06.159
 then I'm exactly right here 

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:09.159
 I can briefly skip my thoughts 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:12.879
 the Cologne began to digress 

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:16.659
 quite right, a different world staggers a fantasy world 

00:03:17.779 --> 00:03:20.849
 there are students was busy by Alexa 

00:03:21.419 --> 00:03:23.249
 Search places 

00:03:23.249 --> 00:03:24.929
 because you as a resident 

00:03:24.929 --> 00:03:29.619
 Lahm does not add to age 

00:03:29.619 --> 00:03:32.189
 you miss the water 

00:03:32.189 --> 00:03:35.249
 this place is right in the middle of the local garden 

00:03:35.249 --> 00:03:37.069
 at a lake 

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:39.249
 this lake is not only 

00:03:39.249 --> 00:03:41.810
 it is really nice here completely relaxed 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:43.999
 the coffers are empty 

00:03:43.999 --> 00:03:47.489
 In the evening you can drink beer and eat coffee 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:50.489
 the smallest always be it really good 

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:18.029
 He further explained that the star of the scenery is almost here 

00:04:18.029 --> 00:04:20.219
 he is the realization of society 

00:04:20.219 --> 00:04:24.449
 Should he he would like to go to Miami only when I waited here 

00:04:24.449 --> 00:04:27.449
 Parent representative Karl Lagerfeld 

00:04:28.879 --> 00:04:31.879
 Guests he is missing me 

00:04:33.029 --> 00:04:34.069
 the soldier 

00:04:34.069 --> 00:04:38.560
 but maybe every time I can I have something serious Andrist 

00:04:38.559 --> 00:04:41.409
 Alex Iran currently does not do it justice 

00:04:41.409 --> 00:04:45.569
 For me, the Emmericher is percent of the IFA 

00:04:45.569 --> 00:04:48.569
 he even managed it number he is the first one 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:53.610
 more I stood that is no longer Steyr right now 

00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:58.620
 everything to be perfect NRW Federer at 4 1 percent lsw 

00:04:59.389 --> 00:05:00.969
 Air France klm 

00:05:00.969 --> 00:05:04.059
 and f the Ferres is a bit quiet 

00:05:04.059 --> 00:05:09.209
 when he ended himself with a knife in Oerlikon Daimler 

00:05:09.779 --> 00:05:11.339
 and the l 

00:05:11.339 --> 00:05:13.419
 the latter had to 

00:05:13.419 --> 00:05:14.449
 with Sepp Bank 

00:05:14.449 --> 00:05:15.930
 choose a swift one 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:18.930
 at the life 

00:05:37.999 --> 00:05:40.639
 is the computer Assen, the domain was over 

00:05:40.639 --> 00:05:43.040
 I study here in Bochum as the security 

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:45.840
 and today I will be my favorite place here on campus 

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:47.020
 demonstrate 

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:48.849
 Heidel Rossmann 

00:05:48.849 --> 00:05:52.589
 As it was said at one point on the campus from here you can 

00:05:52.589 --> 00:05:57.039
 All buildings Euro see both the humanities science 

00:05:57.039 --> 00:06:00.610
 and of course I come to Fini like the fresh ones like all citizens 

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:03.540
 Air and that's why she does not want to be in my time here 

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:08.170
 especially in good weather SID you like to either alone or with 

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:11.840
 Students talk and enjoy the beautiful weather ClauÃŸen 

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:16.400
 I always go against something People from all study programs also come over 

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:21.450
 you meet appearance of the whole Eurozone and that makes easy 

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:24.450
 Pure fun
