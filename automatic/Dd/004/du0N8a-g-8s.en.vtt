hello our topic today toes and running

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.820 
hello our topic today toes and running
there<00:00:04.589> isnít<00:00:04.890> about<00:00:05.460> toes<00:00:06.470> that<00:00:07.470> they<00:00:07.770> do

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830

there isnít about toes that they do
propulsive<00:00:08.760> work<00:00:09.630> and<00:00:09.900> running<00:00:10.110> and<00:00:11.240> this<00:00:12.240> is

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:13.280 
propulsive work and running and this is

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:17.210 
propulsive work and running and this is
because<00:00:14.280> we<00:00:14.490> think<00:00:14.820> so<00:00:15.330> but<00:00:15.900> if<00:00:16.109> it<00:00:16.320> will<00:00:16.470> see

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
because we think so but if it will see

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.720 
because we think so but if it will see
the<00:00:17.520> foot<00:00:17.850> in<00:00:18.600> really<00:00:19.140> and<00:00:19.410> the<00:00:20.130> house<00:00:20.369> of<00:00:20.520> food

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
the foot in really and the house of food

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.840 
the foot in really and the house of food
related<00:00:21.210> with<00:00:21.570> toes<00:00:21.840> will<00:00:22.199> see<00:00:22.680> is<00:00:22.740> it<00:00:22.980> toes

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
related with toes will see is it toes

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.349 
related with toes will see is it toes
not<00:00:24.119> supposed<00:00:24.630> to<00:00:24.720> do<00:00:24.930> this<00:00:24.960> work<00:00:25.410> at<00:00:25.619> all<00:00:26.359> you

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
not supposed to do this work at all you

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.759 
not supposed to do this work at all you
see<00:00:27.570> I'm<00:00:27.840> trying<00:00:28.529> to<00:00:28.859> stay<00:00:29.250> on<00:00:30.380> on<00:00:31.380> the<00:00:31.560> toes

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
see I'm trying to stay on on the toes

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.600 
see I'm trying to stay on on the toes
it's<00:00:32.040> I<00:00:32.160> can't<00:00:32.759> because<00:00:33.360> our<00:00:34.020> toes<00:00:34.320> not

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:34.610 
it's I can't because our toes not

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:38.270 
it's I can't because our toes not
develop<00:00:35.610> to<00:00:35.940> keep<00:00:36.180> our<00:00:36.360> body<00:00:36.600> weight<00:00:36.780> so<00:00:37.530> I<00:00:37.800> can

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
develop to keep our body weight so I can

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.010 
develop to keep our body weight so I can
stay<00:00:38.520> on<00:00:38.670> the<00:00:38.790> ball<00:00:38.969> of<00:00:39.000> the<00:00:39.180> foot<00:00:39.360> but<00:00:39.600> never

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
stay on the ball of the foot but never

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:40.819 
stay on the ball of the foot but never
on<00:00:40.200> the<00:00:40.290> toes

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
on the toes

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.360 
on the toes
so<00:00:41.370> toes<00:00:41.700> just<00:00:42.450> by<00:00:42.600> a<00:00:42.629> from<00:00:43.079> their<00:00:43.710> anatomical

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
so toes just by a from their anatomical

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.389 
so toes just by a from their anatomical
function<00:00:45.030> cannot<00:00:45.660> produce<00:00:46.350> what<00:00:46.890> we<00:00:46.920> think

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
function cannot produce what we think

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.020 
function cannot produce what we think
they<00:00:47.579> should<00:00:47.610> produce<00:00:48.379> I'm<00:00:49.379> in<00:00:50.030> propulsive

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
they should produce I'm in propulsive

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.220 
they should produce I'm in propulsive
product<00:00:51.899> propulsive<00:00:52.469> force<00:00:53.129> and<00:00:54.230> proposals

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
product propulsive force and proposals

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.459 
product propulsive force and proposals
forward<00:00:55.559> but<00:00:56.550> what<00:00:57.000> is<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.719> role<00:00:57.960> they<00:00:58.440> are

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
forward but what is the role they are

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.970 
forward but what is the role they are
playing<00:00:59.090> in<00:01:00.090> running<00:01:00.600> there<00:01:01.350> are<00:01:01.469> two<00:01:01.680> major

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
playing in running there are two major

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.390 
playing in running there are two major
roles<00:01:02.370> with<00:01:02.879> was<00:01:03.480> they<00:01:03.750> playing<00:01:04.229> and<00:01:04.530> the

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
roles with was they playing and the

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.420 
roles with was they playing and the
first<00:01:05.670> one<00:01:05.880> is<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:06.210> stabilization<00:01:07.189> while<00:01:08.189> we

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
first one is the stabilization while we

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.840 
first one is the stabilization while we
staying<00:01:08.760> on<00:01:09.030> the<00:01:09.299> ground

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:10.850 
staying on the ground

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:16.910 
staying on the ground
the<00:01:12.170> toes<00:01:13.170> are<00:01:14.810> stabilizes<00:01:15.810> for<00:01:16.229> our<00:01:16.350> foot<00:01:16.740> on

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
the toes are stabilizes for our foot on

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:22.399 
the toes are stabilizes for our foot on
the<00:01:17.189> ground<00:01:17.280> and<00:01:19.100> when<00:01:20.570> we're<00:01:21.570> staying<00:01:22.049> in

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
the ground and when we're staying in

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.550 
the ground and when we're staying in
keeping<00:01:22.799> our<00:01:22.920> body<00:01:23.610> weights<00:01:23.850> they<00:01:24.330> are

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560 
keeping our body weights they are

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:29.420 
keeping our body weights they are
working<00:01:25.560> as<00:01:25.740> a<00:01:26.840> best<00:01:27.840> perception<00:01:28.500> receptors

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
working as a best perception receptors

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.569 
working as a best perception receptors
for<00:01:30.150> a<00:01:30.210> body<00:01:30.540> weight<00:01:30.780> location<00:01:31.650> on<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:32.340> foot

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
for a body weight location on the foot

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:36.469 
for a body weight location on the foot
and<00:01:33.030> they<00:01:33.570> regulate<00:01:34.369> our<00:01:35.369> shifting<00:01:36.119> body

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
and they regulate our shifting body

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.530 
and they regulate our shifting body
weight<00:01:36.720> from<00:01:37.079> one<00:01:37.380> side<00:01:37.979> of<00:01:38.009> in<00:01:38.540> direction

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
weight from one side of in direction

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.929 
weight from one side of in direction
this<00:01:40.110> is<00:01:40.170> a<00:01:40.320> major<00:01:40.799> role<00:01:41.189> what<00:01:41.640> they<00:01:41.790> are

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
this is a major role what they are

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.920 
this is a major role what they are
playing<00:01:42.150> in<00:01:42.509> running<00:01:42.960> and<00:01:43.189> everything<00:01:44.189> else

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:44.930 
playing in running and everything else

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:47.630 
playing in running and everything else
what<00:01:45.930> is<00:01:46.079> beyond<00:01:46.439> of<00:01:46.590> these<00:01:46.770> two<00:01:47.100> major

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
what is beyond of these two major

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.740 
what is beyond of these two major
functions<00:01:48.479> are<00:01:49.159> pulse<00:01:50.159> and<00:01:50.790> they're<00:01:51.540> not

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
functions are pulse and they're not

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.810 
functions are pulse and they're not
supposed<00:01:52.049> to<00:01:52.610> even<00:01:53.610> be<00:01:54.210> in<00:01:54.600> our<00:01:54.960> consideration

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:55.820 
supposed to even be in our consideration

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:00.859 
supposed to even be in our consideration
so<00:01:56.840> try<00:01:57.840> stay<00:01:58.140> away<00:01:58.710> for<00:01:59.430> using<00:01:59.729> autos<00:02:00.299> from

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
so try stay away for using autos from

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:05.510 
so try stay away for using autos from
push<00:02:01.380> off<00:02:01.649> and<00:02:01.860> toe<00:02:02.100> of<00:02:02.659> efforts<00:02:03.659> and<00:02:04.310> you<00:02:05.310> will

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
push off and toe of efforts and you will

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.540 
push off and toe of efforts and you will
use<00:02:05.759> them<00:02:05.969> in<00:02:06.149> the<00:02:06.360> proper<00:02:06.810> direction<00:02:07.369> this<00:02:08.369> is

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
use them in the proper direction this is

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.289 
use them in the proper direction this is
our<00:02:08.700> topic<00:02:09.060> for<00:02:09.270> today<00:02:09.539> thank<00:02:10.229> you
