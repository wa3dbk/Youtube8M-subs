00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:07.040
 good 

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:16.289
 here on a bank ramp because a 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.940
 ramp which comes from the main that I say 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:22.880
 I do not feel the Turks take away all of us 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.880
 the turbos this place 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:37.500
 Of course, I do not know what 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:40.800
 this race has brought many 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:44.719
 turbo cidade but it's worth looking here 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.719
 to 24 and nothing 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.460
 and stay here until they appear 

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:51.450
 turbay have appeared we hope that 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:51.450
 do not throw me four mines 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:58.030
 we are totally walking that I like 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:00.790
 rather totally not not in the last 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:03.100
 milestone if you have something of interest and I 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:05.770
 I get out of the car car without wanting a 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.000
 little today we have the point that what 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:08.830
 important was we just have to 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.960
 to fall there are half people who have passed 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:13.270
 on youtube nothing boy country two people 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:15.909
 have passed are 17 checkpoints with 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:17.470
 the fall I wish that my perfect life already 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:20.310
 perfect not so much because it's broken 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:20.310
 the crystal of the fall 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:27.000
 as well as the ones that I have here mines of 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:31.729
 proximity let's leave them here 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.729
 because since I have it we're 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:42.410
 some classmates was so 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:46.500
 proximity concentrate is that we are 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:52.930
 to the curve but good let's go boy all 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:55.210
 first optic as take off trace cases 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:56.619
 to see if we can win what I 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:59.229
 Give me it's going to be a bit complicated 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:00.630
 but hear that by trying we do not lose 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:03.860
 nothing 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.860
 a legislator 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:13.879
 but good is coming to a place 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:16.910
 where there is turbo where there can be a 

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:19.040
 acrobatics you have to look at things and 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:21.080
 it seems that he has caught the point thing that 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.060
 I love it so it seems critical to 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.739
 hand out repairs xx here we can 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:28.569
 walk all the time that mine or something and 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:28.569
 bay jumped eye eye 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:38.390
 oh what a shame denied mónica next to wynton 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:41.510
 same so it does not matter that the key is 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:43.640
 in catching the turbos that are supposed to 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:45.909
 they have to leave already Alberto badía like 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.909
 i love you 

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:01.299

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:19.540
 Thank you
