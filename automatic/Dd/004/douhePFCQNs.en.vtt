00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
if you want a compressor chooser to

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:32.840 
if you want a compressor chooser to
compress<00:01:32.430> it

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
compress it

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.700 
compress it
now<00:01:33.240> these<00:01:33.360> effects<00:01:33.720> the<00:01:34.200> way<00:01:34.320> you<00:01:34.380> have<00:01:34.590> them
