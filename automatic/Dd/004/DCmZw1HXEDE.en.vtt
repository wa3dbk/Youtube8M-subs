00:00:11.339 --> 00:00:15.519
 if there is a day to day we are on the stand at hyÃ¨res at the ifa 2010 

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:17.880
 it's a priest in the south back novelty a bit for us is mostly 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.390
 proud because almost 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:23.970
 something we talk a lot about on this site this ifa this is the 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.150
 television 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:25.939
 wireless 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:27.109
 without power 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:31.249
 exactly those gases that will present us we had already seen it will have perceived 

00:00:31.249 --> 00:00:32.270
 the only exercise 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:34.450
 and yet he was not 3d 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:37.940
 at n was not in 3d so classify the evolutions to technology that 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:39.960
 brings to all our products 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.220
 in back 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:43.690
 all the time research technology and we spend only for this reason 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:46.300
 in research and development 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:49.180
 a result of these islets messti seed and for example so 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:52.370
 actually this wireless TV you see if he likes that 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:55.120
 which in addition to sums based gasset is improved because 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.200
 we have brought a technology in 3d so we will not go into 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.200
 halal details of operation 

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:04.250
 these are promises and complex took a lot a lot of things 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.740
 similarly very quickly recover from two mental processes that gave 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.219
 it's about technology how does it work on 

00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:14.320
 if a bit like induction% you have 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.870
 the debate takes its mission you have two mobile abandonment besides 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:20.890
 nothing outside from a private electrical terminal and which 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:22.010
 retransmits the whole 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:23.650
 both place of two 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:26.650
 of energy and then all the data 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.680
 m information transmission agree so in fact it's an airlock system it's 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:32.609
 nice it's an asset and a huge advantage 

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:35.509
 to not have on the other hand that I think everyone will start to 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:38.229
 understand because when we watch TV at home with all the 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:39.420
 connectors that has behind 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.150
 it's often very difficult to clean and when you do not see a 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.180
 sheep so frankly la rochelle thing very nice yes joran 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.690
 what is a very beautiful evolution how much this product is a product that does not 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:49.990
 not work she says she 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:53.740
 quite it is not finalized at 106 the industrial parks still targeted 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:56.730
 in May for this project but it is planned for the second 

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:59.180
 I would say 2012 early 2012 2012 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:00.230
 effectively 

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:02.250
 listen here is great news 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.940
 it allows us to make a linden a small step of presentation of the 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:06.920
 Virgin 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.039
 yes if you want more than iraq not very well known on europe 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:11.349
 for the time being 

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:15.660
 ultimately went with you a multinational of Chinese origin 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.199
 twenty years ago distance 

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:21.599
 which is the first appliance brand in the world in terms of 

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:24.609
 market share since the end of last year since the end of 2009 

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:28.409
 e is present or not only obviously this in all countries 

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:30.119
 asians but also africa 

00:02:30.119 --> 00:02:31.769
 in the us where we 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:34.089
 we have been very well established for fifteen years 

00:02:34.089 --> 00:02:37.029
 and today the strategy related to the bar so to develop everywhere in 

00:02:37.029 --> 00:02:39.329
 the world and we do it for example by francising 

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:42.379
 we try to implement the brand that is in home appliances but 

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:43.369
 also telly 

00:02:43.369 --> 00:02:46.189
 e on the French market okay we can start to actually see the 

00:02:46.189 --> 00:02:49.140
 TVs by the way sion to make a quick tour of the booth we see a 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.069
 the proposals of its important 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:52.169
 on this end of the year 

00:02:52.169 --> 00:02:53.349
 since we are in mourning 

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:56.859
 founded in September 2005 I presume he had had things that are going 

00:02:56.859 --> 00:02:58.249
 return for 1 for the season 

00:02:58.249 --> 00:03:01.479
 then of three specific models rather actually than it was yesterday 

00:03:01.479 --> 00:03:04.519
 it's often developed especially in small screen sizes 19 and 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:05.749
 22 inches 

00:03:05.749 --> 00:03:08.569
 we seldom want to show that we are able to enter the 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:12.049
 big leagues in developing from 1 26 inches to 32 inches including 

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:17.469
 slightly different design is called the series at 300 or t3 

00:03:17.469 --> 00:03:19.669
 okay you do not want any fertilizer and then listen to the claims
