00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:03.210
 Welcome to "Wrinkles with Yvonne"! 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.590
 Today I'll show you how to fold a cutlery bag. 

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:15.830
 In my channel you will find folding instructions for 4 cutlery bags. Today we fold these. 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:20.160
 First, halve the napkin into a triangle. 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.210
 The napkin should be in front of you with the two open edges away from you 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:25.940
 demonstrate. 

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:30.750
 This step is necessary to get a visible edge for orientation. 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:37.750
 Now fold the tip of one of the open plies down to the edge of your view. 

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:45.219
 Fold the resulting triangle also to the visible edge towards a narrow strip 

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:49.379
 down and smooth the folding edge well. 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.670
 Repeat this step over the visible edge. 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:01:00.579
 Now take another layer and fold the tip back down to the visible edge. 

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:05.510
 Fold the resulting triangle again to the visible edge to a narrow strip 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:08.980
 down and smooth the folding edge well. 

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:10.370
 Turn the napkin over. 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:17.370
 Halve them to get another visible edge. 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:23.630
 Orient yourself at this and now beat the napkin from the outside in to the middle 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:24.670
 in. 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:28.660
 Repeat this section on the other side as well. 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:33.050
 And already the cutlery bag is ready. 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:36.950
 Thank you for watching! I would be happy about a "thumbs up" and if so 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:38.740
 you subscribe to my channel. 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.250
 Always remember: "Where love covers the table, it tastes best!" 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:44.020
 Until next time! 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.830
 And here you can find me on the web, on Twitter and on Facebook. 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.000
