00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:19.060
 now here is the sedona model of the 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.470
 quarter mark which is also a 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:22.480
 American device like the excalibur 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:23.680
 it's really my favorite model 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.820
 today because I think he has 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:27.790
 made any improvements 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:29.470
 which are notable that are very useful to 

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:32.230
 know not only the design that is 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:34.180
 prettier clutter which is a 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:37.180
 little more compact and especially 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:38.920
 the door that in the excalibur you 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:40.300
 have seen it we remove it we risk the 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:42.070
 to make it fall is always a small 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.050
 not cumbersome while this one the 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:46.180
 door she fx and she opens up very 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:49.269
 easily and leaves enough space for 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:50.979
 see pull the gifts over she is 

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:52.989
 transparent which brings anyway 

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:54.640
 a plus because it allows us that 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:56.440
 to check what is in the process of 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.790
 to not forget that there are 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.390
 preparations drying in one 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:01.030
 only at a glance 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:03.250
 then the other thing about sedona 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:06.369
 it's the whole configuration of 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:07.810
 functions it's an electronic system 

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:09.549
 which is really handy which you 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:10.930
 allows to be extremely sharp 

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:14.850
 I will show you the use of 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:17.049
 buttons we will first light it 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.970
 then you have the first button that 

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:21.130
 allows you to see the temperature either 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:21.490
 in degrees Celsius a degree ferrell 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:23.290
 wright 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:24.970
 so that's very very handy 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:26.230
 see if I push on I'm going to have 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:28.780
 108 

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:30.190
 I think it's worth 42 so 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:31.840
 famous 105 are a human people 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:33.430
 rather 41 42 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.930
 but now for the moment frozen fix them 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:36.760
 on 40 game the two numbers that 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:38.440
 are displayed are the first temperature 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:39.970
 and the second the number of hours for 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:41.470
 which you have programmed your machine 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:44.170
 then to change on the temperature 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:45.760
 the number of hours is enough 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:47.800
 push the button called 7 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:49.510
 the first number will start 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:51.340
 flash and there you can change the 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:53.140
 going up or down by 10 or 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.240
 parent then for example if I go down 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:57.370
 at 41 here I have everything on this button there I 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.830
 go down the a40 where I can go up to 45 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:02.540
 I can go up to 55 if I want for the 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:04.400
 first hour will go down pod 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:07.550
 of the salvation of this pressure and then 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:09.979
 go down again to 41.46 I 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:11.510
 pushes back on seven and that figure the fx 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:13.340
 now the number of hours and that's 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.570
 the same I ride 10 games drawings of 10 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.520
 I rest on seven 

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:20.270
 now that both functions if they 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:22.550
 are determined I still have two 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:25.160
 options so the first one is called 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:27.050
 the 13 and that means is what I 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:30.260
 wants to select the entire cabin or 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:32.210
 simply the top or just the bottom 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:36.650
 all together and I will show you 

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:38.990
 in fact the camera comes with a tray 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:41.930
 which is diluted full and which will allow 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:43.490
 to separate the inside of the device into 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.840
 two so that's when you want 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:47.300
 redo when you only have two three 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.230
 less than four trays to dry it's 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:49.340
 what you can do I'm going to 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:50.840
 show instantly how and you 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:52.040
 do not forget in this case to squeeze 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.240
 on the button to select the 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:56.270
 upper and lower part where 

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:57.620
 the entire device the second 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:00.020
 option is this one called fashion 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.790
 this is the day where fashion night mode so I 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:03.770
 do not really use it a lot because 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:05.060
 that the night we are not in our 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:06.500
 kitchen so there's no problem but it 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:08.540
 it can help people who live 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.950
 in small spaces and he wants the 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:11.150
 to dry during the night or the 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:13.160
 kitchen is right next to the room at 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.420
 to face them allows them to decrease 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:16.100
 a little bit the sound level 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:17.450
 here and to start once you 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:20.330
 have fixed all this a lot it's on the 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:21.250
 button there and the device starts to 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:22.470
 to dry 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:23.790
 to extinguish it 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.260
 simply you are in a hurry to 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:25.680
 new by the way when you open the 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.510
 door 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:30.030
 you will see the device goes out 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:31.580
 automatically manage it to him but one 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:34.800
 will open it 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:36.900
 here it goes off now I'm going 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:38.430
 show you the trays then they are 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.950
 a little different from those of the excluded 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:44.400
 it is also enough said of an improvement 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:47.730
 quite nice pointed out that the 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:49.200
 manufacture of his donna is without bpa 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:50.280
 it is guaranteed without bpa what is not 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.780
 not the case of the bur talent which is a 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:54.840
 older model Sedona anyway 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:56.310
 is guaranteed example of bph then the 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:59.910
 trays are a little different but 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:01.050
 you see there is already a state surface 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:03.240
 age which is a little bit less than 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:04.800
 the excalibur that's maybe the 

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:06.240
 disadvantage but as there are a lot of 

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:07.560
 plateau in general we get out when 

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:08.990
 very well what is useful is 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:12.360
 that there is a small edge ac pato 

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:13.950
 so it can fill well without 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.610
 risk running down the edges so that 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:18.030
 was very very good 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:19.350
 the antistatic fences are a 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:20.910
 little bit tighter they are pretty 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:22.200
 easy to clean this says you're full of 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:25.380
 clean with water or simply 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:26.760
 the caches must be so here are the 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:29.190
 fences are a little bit more 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:31.080
 tight sieve and more series what wants 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:32.610
 say that you can more masters 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:34.500
 things like seeds etc 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:36.180
 even small as flaxseed from 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:39.479
 sesame without it falling through 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:40.530
 it's also an improvement the a9 then 

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:43.560
 you have the trouble leaves 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:45.630
 antiadhesive only with excalibur 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:47.280
 reality the sedona according to there you 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:49.710
 buy it will come with leaves that 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:51.270
 are a little less efficient and 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:52.979
 practical as that of the excalibur and 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:53.820
 Swiss our provider what he did 

00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:55.919
 he bought the leaves 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:57.390
 excalibur he cut them to the size of 

00:04:55.919 --> 00:04:58.800
 these breakdowns advanced this one you receive 

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:00.840
 so these are the same leaves 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:03.180
 we actually put it above the 

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:04.590
 tray with the material dried and 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:06.419
 now show you how to do 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:08.460
 when you use it the super part or 

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:11.669
 the bottom part you see there by 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:15.300
 example I have four boats at the top 

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:18.090
 I also have 4 below if I put this 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:19.160
 plateau if in the middle it will allow to 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:21.740
 to separate 

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:23.210
 the aeration is actually behind there 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:23.660
 two fans have one at the top and 

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:25.070
 below 

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:27.530
 when you run both 

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:28.820
 you all use there all the cockpit 

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:29.510
 and if you make it work that a 

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:31.370
 either 

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:33.800
 then you use that tray that 

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:36.070
 is full to separate the two from 

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:38.750
 part of the machine 

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:41.380
 that's it for the cdh the world 

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:43.400
 one more note about 

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:45.260
 the energy that is consumed canton 

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:46.970
 dehydrates foods with 

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:48.650
 excalibur with sedna you have to know 

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:51.590
 that it's definitely more economical to 

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:53.000
 to dry preparations with this kind 

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:54.830
 only with a traditional oven 

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.570
 which consumes him enormously especially a 

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:58.130
 rotary heat oven launched this is 

00:05:56.570 --> 00:06:00.410
 a lot of boxes that are consumed I 

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:02.840
 do not have the exact number but it's 

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:03.650
 a consumption who is who and who is 

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:04.880
 done but that is quite 

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:07.570
 reasonable even if you spin 

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:07.570
 for 24 hours
