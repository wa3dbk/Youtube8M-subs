00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:44.990 
definitely is a lot better than the

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:47.500 
definitely is a lot better than the
fingers<00:04:45.350> press<00:04:46.040> it<00:04:46.220> on<00:04:46.370> and<00:04:46.670> that's<00:04:46.790> all<00:04:47.360> there

off and what do you think let's angle it
like<00:04:55.760> so<00:04:56.270> and<00:04:56.930> I<00:04:57.020> have<00:04:57.260> to<00:04:57.620> the<00:04:58.610> dimensionals

00:04:59.230 --> 00:04:59.240 
like so and I have to the dimensionals

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:00.970 
like so and I have to the dimensionals
on<00:04:59.420> the<00:04:59.570> back<00:04:59.750> and<00:04:59.960> that's<00:05:00.050> sufficient<00:05:00.770> and

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:00.980 
on the back and that's sufficient and

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:04.210 
on the back and that's sufficient and
voila<00:05:01.880> let<00:05:02.600> me<00:05:02.720> just<00:05:02.930> show<00:05:03.110> you<00:05:03.140> what<00:05:04.040> we<00:05:04.190> can

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:04.220 
voila let me just show you what we can

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:06.510 
voila let me just show you what we can
do<00:05:04.490> to<00:05:04.610> the<00:05:04.730> inside<00:05:05.180> this<00:05:05.780> is<00:05:05.990> just<00:05:06.260> some

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:06.520 
do to the inside this is just some

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:10.570 
do to the inside this is just some
printer<00:05:07.520> paper<00:05:07.550> here<00:05:08.180> that<00:05:08.390> I<00:05:09.430> stamped<00:05:10.430> a

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:10.580 
printer paper here that I stamped a

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:13.890 
printer paper here that I stamped a
verse<00:05:10.940> on<00:05:11.240> and<00:05:11.600> I<00:05:11.780> like<00:05:12.440> to<00:05:12.650> do<00:05:12.800> paper<00:05:13.100> liners<00:05:13.610> I

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:13.900 
verse on and I like to do paper liners I

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:16.390 
verse on and I like to do paper liners I
just<00:05:14.900> think<00:05:15.080> it<00:05:15.170> takes<00:05:15.440> it<00:05:15.650> up<00:05:15.710> a<00:05:15.860> notch<00:05:16.070> and

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:16.400 
just think it takes it up a notch and

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:20.260 
just think it takes it up a notch and
I've<00:05:16.880> stamped<00:05:17.240> a<00:05:17.450> couple<00:05:17.840> of<00:05:17.990> virtue<00:05:18.850> on<00:05:19.850> this

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:20.270 
I've stamped a couple of virtue on this

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:22.780 
I've stamped a couple of virtue on this
and<00:05:20.600> when<00:05:21.470> you're<00:05:21.620> stamping<00:05:22.010> these<00:05:22.370> don't<00:05:22.700> go

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:22.790 
and when you're stamping these don't go

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:25.090 
and when you're stamping these don't go
too<00:05:22.940> high<00:05:23.390> with<00:05:23.660> that<00:05:23.840> because<00:05:24.080> that<00:05:24.560> just<00:05:24.590> is

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:25.100 
too high with that because that just is

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:27.550 
too high with that because that just is
not<00:05:25.340> appealing<00:05:25.880> you<00:05:26.600> want<00:05:26.810> to<00:05:26.900> bring<00:05:27.200> it<00:05:27.350> down

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:27.560 
not appealing you want to bring it down

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:29.350 
not appealing you want to bring it down
to<00:05:27.950> about<00:05:27.980> so<00:05:28.490> and<00:05:28.670> you<00:05:28.760> got<00:05:28.910> a<00:05:28.940> verse<00:05:29.180> about

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:29.360 
to about so and you got a verse about

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:32.620 
to about so and you got a verse about
that<00:05:29.720> size<00:05:30.070> not<00:05:31.070> in<00:05:31.430> the<00:05:31.580> middle<00:05:31.940> because<00:05:32.240> you

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:32.630 
that size not in the middle because you

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:34.920 
that size not in the middle because you
want<00:05:32.810> to<00:05:32.900> leave<00:05:33.080> space<00:05:33.590> here<00:05:33.800> to<00:05:33.980> write<00:05:34.220> and

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:34.930 
want to leave space here to write and

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:39.640 
want to leave space here to write and
the<00:05:35.930> size<00:05:36.470> of<00:05:36.770> this<00:05:37.040> is<00:05:37.570> four<00:05:38.570> and<00:05:38.600> a<00:05:38.930> fourth<00:05:39.290> by

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:39.650 
the size of this is four and a fourth by

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:41.620 
the size of this is four and a fourth by
five<00:05:40.010> and<00:05:40.220> a<00:05:40.280> half<00:05:40.310> so<00:05:40.670> I<00:05:40.700> took<00:05:40.880> off<00:05:41.270> probably

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:41.630 
five and a half so I took off probably

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:44.730 
five and a half so I took off probably
about<00:05:42.290> an<00:05:42.470> eighth<00:05:42.620> of<00:05:42.800> an<00:05:42.920> inch<00:05:43.100> on<00:05:43.370> each<00:05:44.030> side

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:44.740 
about an eighth of an inch on each side

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:47.500 
about an eighth of an inch on each side
another<00:05:45.740> little<00:05:46.130> thing<00:05:46.310> that<00:05:46.640> might<00:05:47.060> help<00:05:47.300> you

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:47.510 
another little thing that might help you

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:50.410 
another little thing that might help you
is<00:05:47.750> do<00:05:48.290> not<00:05:48.680> get<00:05:49.250> in<00:05:49.430> this<00:05:49.700> crease<00:05:50.120> because

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:50.420 
is do not get in this crease because

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:52.210 
is do not get in this crease because
what<00:05:50.750> happens<00:05:51.140> is<00:05:51.230> when<00:05:51.410> you<00:05:51.530> fold<00:05:51.830> the<00:05:51.980> sheet

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:52.220 
what happens is when you fold the sheet

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:56.530 
what happens is when you fold the sheet
of<00:05:52.250> paper<00:05:53.500> it<00:05:54.500> will<00:05:54.950> band<00:05:55.340> into<00:05:55.910> that<00:05:56.090> so<00:05:56.360> when

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:56.540 
of paper it will band into that so when

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:58.129 
of paper it will band into that so when
you're<00:05:56.660> putting<00:05:56.930> this<00:05:57.140> on<00:05:57.320> make<00:05:57.590> sure<00:05:57.830> you

00:05:58.129 --> 00:05:58.139 
you're putting this on make sure you

00:05:58.139 --> 00:05:59.869 
you're putting this on make sure you
keep<00:05:58.379> that<00:05:58.590> back<00:05:58.650> and<00:05:59.009> then<00:05:59.129> I<00:05:59.159> just<00:05:59.280> took<00:05:59.669> our

00:05:59.869 --> 00:05:59.879

00:06:01.939 --> 00:06:01.949 
snail ran a little bit of tape across

00:06:01.949 --> 00:06:05.149 
snail ran a little bit of tape across
