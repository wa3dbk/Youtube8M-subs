I<00:00:38.910> think<00:00:39.480> it's<00:00:39.600> no<00:00:39.719> I<00:00:39.750> think<00:00:39.840> it's<00:00:40.079> big<00:00:40.260> for

00:00:40.279 --> 00:00:40.289 
I think it's no I think it's big for

00:00:40.289 --> 00:00:42.889 
I think it's no I think it's big for
everybody<00:00:40.890> oral<00:00:41.730> is<00:00:41.820> going<00:00:41.969> to<00:00:42.030> be<00:00:42.149> role

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
everybody oral is going to be role

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.290 
everybody oral is going to be role

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
so this is the start of it would be a

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:49.729 
so this is the start of it would be a
lot<00:00:48.780> easier<00:00:48.839> for<00:00:49.350> him<00:00:49.409> where<00:00:49.530> he's<00:00:49.649> playing
