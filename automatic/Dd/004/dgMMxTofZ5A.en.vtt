00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
for range champions this is when the

this<00:00:41.129> is<00:00:41.309> stutter<00:00:41.579> stepping<00:00:43.160> let<00:00:44.160> me<00:00:44.280> explain

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
this is stutter stepping let me explain

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.040 
this is stutter stepping let me explain
this<00:00:44.789> a<00:00:44.850> little<00:00:45.059> bit<00:00:45.270> more<00:00:45.510> because<00:00:45.870> there's

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
this a little bit more because there's

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.410 
this a little bit more because there's
two<00:00:46.230> important<00:00:46.739> things<00:00:46.950> going<00:00:47.070> on<00:00:47.430> by<00:00:48.360> default

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
two important things going on by default

two important things going on by default
when<00:00:49.020> you're<00:00:49.140> attacking<00:00:49.590> an<00:00:49.710> enemy<00:00:50.039> you<00:00:50.190> won't

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
when you're attacking an enemy you won't

move<00:00:50.640> to<00:00:50.820> pursue<00:00:51.120> them<00:00:51.300> unless<00:00:51.510> they've

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
move to pursue them unless they've

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.020 
move to pursue them unless they've
actually<00:00:51.930> moved<00:00:52.230> out<00:00:52.500> of<00:00:52.649> your<00:00:52.800> range<00:00:53.039> by

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
actually moved out of your range by

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.819 
actually moved out of your range by
moving<00:00:54.270> between<00:00:54.809> attacks<00:00:55.110> you<00:00:55.350> can<00:00:55.500> stay<00:00:55.680> in

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
moving between attacks you can stay in

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.819 
moving between attacks you can stay in
their<00:00:55.949> path<00:00:56.160> and<00:00:56.430> get<00:00:56.550> more<00:00:56.760> attacks<00:00:57.120> out<00:00:57.829> the

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
their path and get more attacks out the

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.529 
their path and get more attacks out the
second<00:00:59.250> thing<00:00:59.370> involves<00:00:59.820> an<00:00:59.910> animation<00:01:00.300> on

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
second thing involves an animation on

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.150 
second thing involves an animation on
your<00:01:00.719> character<00:01:00.989> that<00:01:01.289> occurs<00:01:01.590> after<00:01:01.770> your

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
your character that occurs after your

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.240 
your character that occurs after your
attack<00:01:02.430> goes<00:01:02.670> out<00:01:03.140> watch<00:01:04.140> closely<00:01:04.500> as<00:01:04.920> Zyra

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
attack goes out watch closely as Zyra

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.539 
attack goes out watch closely as Zyra
launches<00:01:05.880> her<00:01:05.970> attack<00:01:06.330> at<00:01:06.920> this<00:01:07.920> point<00:01:08.280> in<00:01:08.430> the

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
launches her attack at this point in the

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.910 
launches her attack at this point in the
animation<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:09.270> projectile<00:01:09.840> is<00:01:10.020> already<00:01:10.619> out

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
animation the projectile is already out

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.609 
animation the projectile is already out
I<00:01:11.250> chose<00:01:12.090> Zyra<00:01:12.420> because<00:01:12.780> of<00:01:12.930> how<00:01:13.049> quickly<00:01:13.409> her

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
I chose Zyra because of how quickly her

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.859 
I chose Zyra because of how quickly her
projectile<00:01:14.189> actually<00:01:14.610> fires<00:01:14.909> making<00:01:15.750> her<00:01:15.840> a

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
projectile actually fires making her a

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.929 
projectile actually fires making her a

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
animations and you'll need to get used

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:24.350 
animations and you'll need to get used
to<00:01:23.670> each<00:01:23.820> of<00:01:24.030> them

little time to build up which is
