00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
just be gentle with this and it's best

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.319 
just be gentle with this and it's best
to<00:01:43.920> do<00:01:44.100> this<00:01:44.220> immediately<00:01:44.549> after<00:01:45.119> you<00:01:45.210> take

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
to do this immediately after you take

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:46.550 
to do this immediately after you take
them<00:01:45.479> off<00:01:45.630> because<00:01:45.810> that's<00:01:46.049> when<00:01:46.290> the<00:01:46.350> glue<00:01:46.530> is

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
them off because that's when the glue is

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.499 
them off because that's when the glue is
already<00:01:47.009> softened<00:01:47.460> and<00:01:48.060> it'd<00:01:48.180> be<00:01:48.299> a<00:01:48.329> lot

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
already softened and it'd be a lot

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.010 
already softened and it'd be a lot
harder<00:01:48.810> to<00:01:49.110> do<00:01:49.229> it<00:01:49.380> later<00:01:49.500> on<00:01:49.799> so<00:01:50.840> just<00:01:51.840> get<00:01:51.990> out

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
harder to do it later on so just get out

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.020 
harder to do it later on so just get out
any<00:01:52.320> visible<00:01:52.860> glue<00:01:53.399> that<00:01:53.579> you<00:01:53.640> can<00:01:53.759> see

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
any visible glue that you can see

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.870 
any visible glue that you can see
usually<00:01:54.570> there's<00:01:54.750> some<00:01:55.280> that<00:01:56.280> Falls<00:01:56.520> up<00:01:56.729> on

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
usually there's some that Falls up on

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:08.029 
usually there's some that Falls up on
the<00:01:57.000> ends

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.760 

and<00:02:08.549> there<00:02:08.670> we<00:02:08.759> go

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
and there we go

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.470 
and there we go
that's<00:02:11.400> the<00:02:11.520> last<00:02:11.700> thing<00:02:11.820> you<00:02:12.000> can<00:02:12.120> do<00:02:12.240> is<00:02:12.360> just

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
that's the last thing you can do is just

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:26.980 
that's the last thing you can do is just
go<00:02:12.630> put<00:02:12.810> them<00:02:12.900> back<00:02:13.050> to<00:02:13.170> my<00:02:13.260> case<00:02:24.230> that's<00:02:25.230> how

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:26.990 
go put them back to my case that's how

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:29.870 
go put them back to my case that's how
you<00:02:27.990> store<00:02:28.260> your<00:02:28.380> lashes<00:02:28.890> and<00:02:29.160> clean<00:02:29.460> them<00:02:29.670> I

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
you store your lashes and clean them I

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:31.760 
you store your lashes and clean them I
hope<00:02:30.870> that<00:02:31.170> was<00:02:31.320> helpful

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
hope that was helpful

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:34.610 
hope that was helpful
I'll<00:02:31.920> talk<00:02:32.130> to<00:02:32.160> guys<00:02:32.370> later
