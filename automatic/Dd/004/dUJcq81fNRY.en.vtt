a little bit of the technology that you
guys<00:01:55.740> have<00:01:55.890> been<00:01:55.950> working<00:01:56.130> on<00:01:56.399> to<00:01:56.520> make<00:01:56.640> sure

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
guys have been working on to make sure

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.520 
guys have been working on to make sure
the<00:01:56.880> project<00:01:57.270> Morpheus<00:01:57.659> is<00:01:57.750> is<00:01:58.170> going<00:01:58.350> to<00:01:58.409> be<00:01:58.500> a
