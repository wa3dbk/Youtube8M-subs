again<00:01:59.039> it's<00:01:59.490> not<00:01:59.640> so<00:01:59.759> much<00:01:59.820> the<00:01:59.940> attack<00:02:00.270> on<00:02:00.450> me

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
again it's not so much the attack on me

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.029 
again it's not so much the attack on me
as<00:02:00.750> a<00:02:00.780> person<00:02:01.110> but<00:02:01.320> the<00:02:01.560> idea<00:02:01.830> that<00:02:01.860> the

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
they have to make difficult cuts they

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:07.820 
they have to make difficult cuts they
don't<00:02:06.660> make<00:02:06.810> them<00:02:06.990> in<00:02:07.140> ways<00:02:07.289> that<00:02:07.350> sort<00:02:07.770> of
