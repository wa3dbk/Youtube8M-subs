 Standing only in the voyage to that long Iskandar 

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:15.000
 Without the peace of the whole universe there is no happiness on earth 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:26.010
 Yamato is there to protect the peace of the universe 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:26.010
 Were we not fighting together in the Yamato ? 

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:32.870
 Position and transition 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.240
 I will go even if I get a punishment 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:38.700

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:38.700
 It is our mission to have lived in Yamato together with 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.410
 Sada 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:49.530

 Tokugawa Chief Engineer 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:55.530
 Let's go good 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.550

 Let's live five mountains 

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:04.940
 Everyone 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.190

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:19.010

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:32.799
 Who are you 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.799

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:35.470

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:44.200
 That that I am just a dick is smoking cormorant that is was a maintenance test cleaning staff of the dock 

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:48.130
 Maintenance examination cleaning worker 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:53.840
 What have you been up to now ? 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:02:00.160
 Oh my I never shoveled that 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:00.160
 Is there no 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:06.310
 Don't go swimming 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:10.050
 As I heard now, it's raining 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:11.140
 We may be rebels from now on 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:15.560
 But 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:19.420
 I do not intend to bend my conviction to aim for peace between the earth and the universe 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:23.819
 I don't think I'm going through wrong 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.819
 Yes it can understand forward 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:34.489
 It's a tough request, but I wonder if I can also take you 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:45.270
 I have seen and worked here for the past year 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:48.360
 It is the yearning ship that saved the earth for the first time 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:55.500
 I did not get bored even looking at it all day 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:58.520
 So it's sad and sad to hear that Yamato will be out of print, and you are my job from the top 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.520
 Anyway it's over 

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:04.520
 I guess Yamada go if you can say that what 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.970
 I want to work in Yamato 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:13.190
 Since it is a fine to say that yes replenishment personnel 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:22.769
 So what can you do 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:26.420
 Even though it is said that the maintenance of a , it was the thing that only the noise cleaning was done 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:30.310
 There is no confidence in the prosthetic hand 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:30.310
 I will handle a little with radar 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:35.550
 Or so 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:36.670
 Well known was you 

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:39.420

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:39.420
 That Dewa' 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:44.730
 It is better if there are more crew members 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:45.730
 I firmly ask you 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:49.379
 Ah 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:49.379
 Yes, thank you 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:55.490
 This is an ancient advance of the captain 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:55.490

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:03.620
 Barak Ness 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:10.110

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:14.330

 It is partnered rookie of the name of the Prime Minister 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:17.080
 Totally 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:31.629
 End up 

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:31.629
 Don't you say 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:36.600
 Let me think 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:39.200
 It is not to defeat the command 

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:39.200
 To me 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:41.919
 End up 

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:53.030
 Snow Know Me Finger 

00:04:53.510 --> 00:05:00.149
 Large fetch the shellfish came into your room 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:03.149
 You will be busy from now on
