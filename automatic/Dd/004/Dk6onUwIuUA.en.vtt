minus 9 inches so this is how I'm going

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.340 
minus 9 inches so this is how I'm going
to<00:01:05.790> find<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.119> middle<00:01:06.500> 9/2<00:01:08.479> equals<00:01:09.479> four<00:01:10.110> and<00:01:10.290> a

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
to find the middle 9/2 equals four and a

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:17.390 
to find the middle 9/2 equals four and a
half<00:01:11.659> I'm<00:01:12.659> going<00:01:12.960> to<00:01:13.460> measure<00:01:14.460> down<00:01:15.680> my<00:01:16.680> first

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
half I'm going to measure down my first

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.620 
half I'm going to measure down my first
measurement

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:20.630 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:25.389 

and<00:01:21.380> now<00:01:21.560> I'm<00:01:21.649> going<00:01:21.979> to<00:01:23.350> connect<00:01:24.350> the<00:01:24.829> top<00:01:25.130> to

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.590 
the bottom and I triangle form so once
again<00:01:30.970> your<00:01:31.970> bottom<00:01:32.600> measurement<00:01:33.259> at<00:01:33.350> the<00:01:33.470> top

00:01:41.919 --> 00:01:41.929 
going up and down as your first

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:44.020 
going up and down as your first
measurement<00:01:42.649> and<00:01:43.369> you're<00:01:43.490> going<00:01:43.640> to<00:01:43.819> go<00:01:43.939> ahead

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.030 
measurement and you're going to go ahead

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:50.789 
measurement and you're going to go ahead
and<00:01:44.270> connect<00:01:44.689> both<00:01:48.880> now<00:01:49.880> with<00:01:50.210> my<00:01:50.420> paper

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:50.799 
and connect both now with my paper

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:56.589 
and connect both now with my paper
equaling<00:01:51.799> at<00:01:51.950> least<00:01:52.159> a<00:01:52.990> yard<00:01:53.990> and<00:01:54.170> a<00:01:54.229> half<00:01:55.599> I'm

going to fold it in half and I'm going

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:06.760 
going to fold it in half and I'm going
to<00:02:02.590> use<00:02:03.590> my<00:02:03.619> umpire<00:02:04.399> waist<00:02:04.729> measurement<00:02:05.770> which

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
to use my umpire waist measurement which

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:08.740 
to use my umpire waist measurement which
is<00:02:06.890> the<00:02:07.009> third<00:02:07.220> measurement<00:02:07.700> my<00:02:08.239> measurement

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:08.750 
is the third measurement my measurement

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:16.120 
is the third measurement my measurement
was<00:02:08.840> 32<00:02:09.410> inches<00:02:09.860> and<00:02:10.480> i'm<00:02:11.480> going<00:02:11.720> to<00:02:11.900> use<00:02:15.130> 6.28

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
was 32 inches and i'm going to use 6.28

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:19.780 
was 32 inches and i'm going to use 6.28
which<00:02:16.519> is<00:02:16.700> pi<00:02:17.239> and<00:02:18.160> that's<00:02:19.160> going<00:02:19.489> to<00:02:19.579> give<00:02:19.670> me

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
which is pi and that's going to give me

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:25.850 
which is pi and that's going to give me
my<00:02:20.060> radius

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.980

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.640 
points see I got a little bit off track

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:45.260 
points see I got a little bit off track
but<00:03:39.000> now<00:03:39.209> I'm<00:03:39.510> on<00:03:39.720> track

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:45.270

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
i'm doing here is i'm going to just cut

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:01.310 
i'm doing here is i'm going to just cut
it<00:03:56.360> where<00:03:57.360> I<00:03:57.390> had<00:03:57.690> the<00:03:57.870> fold<00:03:58.140> line<00:04:00.050> because<00:04:01.050> I

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:01.320 
it where I had the fold line because I

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:03.890 
it where I had the fold line because I
don't<00:04:01.590> really<00:04:01.650> need<00:04:02.010> that<00:04:02.480> you<00:04:03.480> can<00:04:03.690> use<00:04:03.870> it

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
don't really need that you can use it

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:07.090 
don't really need that you can use it
it's<00:04:04.170> optional<00:04:04.770> if<00:04:05.730> you<00:04:05.910> have<00:04:06.000> enough<00:04:06.240> fabric

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:07.100 
it's optional if you have enough fabric

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:11.500 
it's optional if you have enough fabric
but<00:04:08.100> since<00:04:09.090> I<00:04:09.150> cut<00:04:09.450> it<00:04:09.680> I'm<00:04:10.680> going<00:04:10.980> to<00:04:11.130> place

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:11.510 
but since I cut it I'm going to place

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:17.810 
but since I cut it I'm going to place
and<00:04:12.510> mark<00:04:13.260> it<00:04:13.440> on<00:04:13.590> fold<00:04:15.980> and<00:04:16.980> then<00:04:17.130> on<00:04:17.400> the

upper part I'm going to mark it as the

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:26.420 
upper part I'm going to mark it as the
side<00:04:22.170> seam<00:04:22.640> so<00:04:23.640> i<00:04:23.700> will<00:04:23.940> know<00:04:23.970> when<00:04:24.300> i<00:04:25.400> place<00:04:26.400> it

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
side seam so i will know when i place it

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:32.480 
side seam so i will know when i place it
on<00:04:26.730> my<00:04:26.760> fabric<00:04:28.790> so<00:04:29.790> this<00:04:30.180> will<00:04:30.360> be<00:04:30.480> cut<00:04:30.840> to<00:04:31.490> on

on my fabric so this will be cut to on
straight<00:04:33.330> of<00:04:33.480> grain<00:04:39.020> now<00:04:40.020> this<00:04:40.410> is<00:04:40.470> the<00:04:40.710> piece

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:40.890 
straight of grain now this is the piece

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:45.020 
straight of grain now this is the piece
that<00:04:40.920> i<00:04:41.160> had<00:04:41.430> earlier<00:04:42.200> the<00:04:43.200> bust<00:04:43.500> piece<00:04:44.280> you're
