00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
criticism of the watch because the outer

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.660 
criticism of the watch because the outer
ring<00:02:08.039> which<00:02:08.220> is<00:02:08.399> the<00:02:08.550> red<00:02:08.789> one

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670

day and so I told them and kind of wrote

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:23.880 
day and so I told them and kind of wrote
them<00:02:22.150> and<00:02:22.270> said<00:02:22.360> I'd<00:02:22.450> really<00:02:22.690> like<00:02:22.840> you<00:02:22.900> to<00:02:23.020> to

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:25.229 
them and said I'd really like you to to
fix<00:02:24.160> those<00:02:24.370> I<00:02:24.489> don't<00:02:24.670> know<00:02:24.730> if<00:02:24.819> they<00:02:24.910> will<00:02:24.940> but

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:25.239 
fix those I don't know if they will but

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:26.610 
fix those I don't know if they will but
I'd<00:02:25.360> like<00:02:25.480> if<00:02:25.660> they<00:02:25.810> have<00:02:25.840> the<00:02:26.020> option<00:02:26.200> four

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
I'd like if they have the option four

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.610 
I'd like if they have the option four
steps<00:02:26.950> so<00:02:27.640> then<00:02:27.850> that<00:02:28.270> ring<00:02:28.750> when<00:02:29.260> you<00:02:29.380> go<00:02:29.560> to

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
steps so then that ring when you go to

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.610 
steps so then that ring when you go to
your<00:02:29.920> face<00:02:30.510> see<00:02:31.510> the<00:02:31.660> outer<00:02:31.840> ring<00:02:32.140> would<00:02:32.380> show

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
your face see the outer ring would show

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.170 
your face see the outer ring would show
and<00:02:32.950> that<00:02:32.980> I<00:02:33.100> can<00:02:33.280> be<00:02:33.370> checking<00:02:33.790> really

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
and that I can be checking really

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:35.580 
and that I can be checking really
quickly<00:02:34.540> I<00:02:34.569> can<00:02:34.660> just<00:02:34.900> look<00:02:35.050> and<00:02:35.200> see<00:02:35.380> where<00:02:35.560> I

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
quickly I can just look and see where I

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:39.059 
quickly I can just look and see where I
am<00:02:35.739> for<00:02:36.250> my<00:02:36.370> 10,000<00:02:36.910> steps<00:02:37.180> go<00:02:38.170> back<00:02:38.380> but<00:02:38.680> it<00:02:38.920> is

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:39.069 
am for my 10,000 steps go back but it is

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:40.770 
am for my 10,000 steps go back but it is
really<00:02:39.340> good<00:02:39.760> because<00:02:40.180> I<00:02:40.360> had<00:02:40.480> to<00:02:40.569> try<00:02:40.720> to

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
really good because I had to try to

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:42.240 
really good because I had to try to
figure<00:02:40.959> out<00:02:41.080> how<00:02:41.410> many<00:02:41.470> calories<00:02:41.769> would<00:02:42.130> be

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
figure out how many calories would be

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.490 
figure out how many calories would be
10,000<00:02:42.790> steps<00:02:42.970> so<00:02:43.330> at<00:02:43.600> for<00:02:44.019> now<00:02:44.140> I<00:02:44.260> think<00:02:44.290> it's

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
10,000 steps so at for now I think it's

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.330 
10,000 steps so at for now I think it's
more<00:02:44.860> than<00:02:44.890> that<00:02:46.140> exercise<00:02:47.140> you<00:02:47.769> helping<00:02:48.250> it

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
more than that exercise you helping it

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.789 
more than that exercise you helping it
lets<00:02:48.549> you<00:02:48.670> know<00:02:48.819> reminder<00:02:49.569> to<00:02:49.600> stand<00:02:49.989> but<00:02:50.680> it

00:02:50.789 --> 00:02:50.799 
lets you know reminder to stand but it

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:52.500 
lets you know reminder to stand but it
does<00:02:51.010> show<00:02:51.040> your<00:02:51.489> steps<00:02:51.819> if<00:02:52.030> you<00:02:52.150> scroll<00:02:52.450> up

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
does show your steps if you scroll up

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:54.809
