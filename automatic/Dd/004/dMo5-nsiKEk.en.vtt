on there and nicely done it even takes

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.490 
on there and nicely done it even takes
away<00:01:02.579> the<00:01:02.760> circles<00:01:03.180> that<00:01:03.390> I<00:01:03.449> don't<00:01:03.840> need<00:01:04.080> for

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
here at the bottom I've heard this is

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.590 
here at the bottom I've heard this is
actually<00:02:13.860> the<00:02:14.010> best<00:02:14.190> part<00:02:14.580> to<00:02:14.820> start<00:02:15.210> out<00:02:15.360> with

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
actually the best part to start out with

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.650 
actually the best part to start out with
is<00:02:15.960> the<00:02:16.230> bottom<00:02:16.650> so<00:02:17.010> let's<00:02:17.310> cover<00:02:17.640> or<00:02:18.209> not

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
is the bottom so let's cover or not

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.170 
is the bottom so let's cover or not
cover<00:02:18.990> the<00:02:19.320> speaker's<00:02:20.190> here<00:02:20.220> make<00:02:20.790> sure<00:02:20.820> we

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
cover the speaker's here make sure we

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.840 
cover the speaker's here make sure we
don't<00:02:21.209> stretch<00:02:21.780> it<00:02:21.810> out<00:02:22.080> too<00:02:22.410> much<00:02:22.620> and<00:02:23.010> let's

don't stretch it out too much and let's

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:26.980 
don't stretch it out too much and let's
bring<00:02:24.240> it<00:02:24.450> around<00:02:24.600> the<00:02:25.440> side<00:02:25.860> of<00:02:26.100> the<00:02:26.580> bumper
