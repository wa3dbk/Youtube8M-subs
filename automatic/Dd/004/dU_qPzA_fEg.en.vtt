00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 
station on the green line right rail now

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:22.430 
station on the green line right rail now
tell<00:04:20.730> you<00:04:20.850> I<00:04:20.880> didn't<00:04:21.299> make<00:04:21.450> this<00:04:21.750> Arlington

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.440 
tell you I didn't make this Arlington

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.950 
tell you I didn't make this Arlington
station<00:04:22.950> in<00:04:23.070> the<00:04:23.160> first<00:04:23.430> place<00:04:23.669> because<00:04:24.540> this

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 
station in the first place because this

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:27.230 
station in the first place because this
is<00:04:25.110> actually<00:04:25.290> pretty<00:04:25.890> close<00:04:26.340> to<00:04:26.580> the<00:04:26.610> existing

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:27.240 
is actually pretty close to the existing

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.050 
is actually pretty close to the existing
back<00:04:27.480> bay<00:04:27.780> station<00:04:27.810> and<00:04:28.620> I<00:04:29.160> didn't<00:04:29.430> want<00:04:29.700> two

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:30.060 
back bay station and I didn't want two

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:32.450 
back bay station and I didn't want two
stations<00:04:30.570> too<00:04:30.780> close<00:04:31.110> to<00:04:31.350> each<00:04:31.380> other<00:04:31.680> and<00:04:32.010> the

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:32.460 
stations too close to each other and the

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.940 
stations too close to each other and the
public<00:04:32.850> garden<00:04:33.240> isn't<00:04:33.419> directly<00:04:34.020> served<00:04:34.650> as

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:34.950 
public garden isn't directly served as

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:37.430 
public garden isn't directly served as
well<00:04:35.310> as<00:04:35.550> these<00:04:35.850> northwestern<00:04:36.750> neighborhoods

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:37.440 
well as these northwestern neighborhoods

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.830 
well as these northwestern neighborhoods
here<00:04:37.770> so<00:04:38.400> I<00:04:38.430> decided<00:04:38.880> the<00:04:39.120> station<00:04:39.600> should<00:04:39.690> be

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840 
here so I decided the station should be

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:41.420 
here so I decided the station should be
placed<00:04:40.080> a<00:04:40.260> little<00:04:40.500> farther<00:04:40.740> north

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:41.430 
placed a little farther north

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:43.190 
placed a little farther north
from<00:04:41.790> Arlington<00:04:42.360> but<00:04:42.660> still<00:04:42.930> have<00:04:43.170> a

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:43.200 
from Arlington but still have a

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:45.890 
from Arlington but still have a
connection<00:04:43.710> to<00:04:43.920> it<00:04:44.190> to<00:04:44.790> allow<00:04:44.970> easy<00:04:45.300> transfer

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:45.900 
connection to it to allow easy transfer

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:48.710 
connection to it to allow easy transfer
between<00:04:46.050> lance<00:04:46.700> line<00:04:47.700> will<00:04:47.940> then<00:04:48.090> curve<00:04:48.360> west

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:48.720 
between lance line will then curve west

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:52.760 
between lance line will then curve west
and<00:04:50.030> it<00:04:51.030> will<00:04:51.120> enter<00:04:51.450> back<00:04:51.660> bay<00:04:51.930> station<00:04:51.960> which

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:52.770 
and it will enter back bay station which

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:55.310 
and it will enter back bay station which
is<00:04:52.920> directly<00:04:53.400> underneath<00:04:53.850> steward<00:04:54.480> street<00:04:54.840> it

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:55.320 
is directly underneath steward street it

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:56.990 
is directly underneath steward street it
will<00:04:55.530> be<00:04:55.680> about<00:04:56.010> a<00:04:56.070> block<00:04:56.490> away<00:04:56.700> from<00:04:56.820> the

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:57.000 
will be about a block away from the

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.260 
will be about a block away from the
existing<00:04:57.630> back<00:04:57.840> bay<00:04:58.080> station<00:04:58.370> but<00:04:59.370> i<00:04:59.610> made<00:05:00.090> it

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:00.270 
existing back bay station but i made it

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:02.390 
existing back bay station but i made it
on<00:05:00.450> stuart<00:05:00.810> street<00:05:01.020> so<00:05:01.320> it<00:05:01.440> won't<00:05:01.680> have<00:05:01.950> to<00:05:02.160> go

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:02.400 
on stuart street so it won't have to go

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:06.740 
on stuart street so it won't have to go
through<00:05:02.700> deep<00:05:03.600> tunneling<00:05:04.290> or<00:05:05.750> expensive

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:06.750 
through deep tunneling or expensive

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:08.240 
through deep tunneling or expensive
methods<00:05:07.200> because<00:05:07.560> this<00:05:07.680> would<00:05:07.860> just<00:05:08.010> be<00:05:08.130> a

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:08.250 
methods because this would just be a

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:11.000 
methods because this would just be a
simple<00:05:08.490> under<00:05:09.090> road<00:05:09.360> tunnel<00:05:09.770> it'll<00:05:10.770> still

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:11.010 
simple under road tunnel it'll still

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:13.520 
simple under road tunnel it'll still

bordeaux into prudential it was longer

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:44.420 
bordeaux into prudential it was longer
than<00:05:42.810> you<00:05:42.930> think<00:05:43.170> right<00:05:43.560> you<00:05:44.130> thought<00:05:44.370> it

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:44.430

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:47.070 
would just be i won't solve much it does

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:49.430 
would just be i won't solve much it does
solve<00:05:47.400> a<00:05:47.580> lot<00:05:47.790> and<00:05:48.060> more<00:05:48.600> importantly<00:05:49.200> it

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:49.440 
solve a lot and more importantly it

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:51.770 
solve a lot and more importantly it
connects<00:05:49.950> lines<00:05:50.220> much<00:05:50.700> more<00:05:51.030> cohesively
