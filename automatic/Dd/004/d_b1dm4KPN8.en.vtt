when<00:00:45.930> you<00:00:46.020> do<00:00:46.170> that<00:00:46.670> it's<00:00:47.670> going<00:00:47.879> to<00:00:47.969> pull<00:00:48.120> the

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:56.480 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.080 

one<00:00:57.079> of<00:00:57.200> you<00:00:57.260> think<00:00:57.500> about<00:00:57.710> your<00:00:57.920> bow<00:00:58.100> is<00:00:58.460> this

00:00:59.080 --> 00:00:59.090 
one of you think about your bow is this

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:03.460 
one of you think about your bow is this
notch<00:00:59.420> on<00:00:59.660> this<00:00:59.870> side<00:01:00.140> sometimes<00:01:00.940> it's<00:01:02.470> worn

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:03.470 
notch on this side sometimes it's worn

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:06.040 
notch on this side sometimes it's worn
out<00:01:03.680> and<00:01:04.370> it<00:01:04.550> causes<00:01:04.790> it<00:01:05.119> not<00:01:05.150> to<00:01:05.420> sit<00:01:05.659> properly

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:06.050 
out and it causes it not to sit properly

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:13.359 
out and it causes it not to sit properly
so<00:01:06.200> you<00:01:06.320> always<00:01:06.470> check<00:01:06.860> that<00:01:12.220> next<00:01:13.220> we're

00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:13.369
