well<00:00:18.270> but<00:00:18.990> you<00:00:19.080> don't<00:00:19.230> get<00:00:19.320> all<00:00:19.470> the<00:00:19.529> level

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
well but you don't get all the level

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.920 
well but you don't get all the level
packs<00:00:20.039> you<00:00:20.250> don't<00:00:20.430> get<00:00:20.609> the<00:00:20.850> updates<00:00:21.600> and<00:00:21.840> it

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
packs you don't get the updates and it

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.480 
packs you don't get the updates and it
sort<00:00:22.140> of<00:00:22.170> just<00:00:22.230> pick<00:00:22.529> random<00:00:22.890> levels<00:00:23.220> in<00:00:23.340> there

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
sort of just pick random levels in there

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:24.769 
sort of just pick random levels in there
but<00:00:23.880> if<00:00:23.939> you<00:00:24.000> just<00:00:24.119> want<00:00:24.180> to<00:00:24.300> fool<00:00:24.449> around<00:00:24.510> and

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
but if you just want to fool around and

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.230 
but if you just want to fool around and
try<00:00:24.960> the<00:00:25.019> game<00:00:25.260> this<00:00:25.800> is<00:00:26.010> a<00:00:26.039> great<00:00:26.550> way<00:00:26.939> to<00:00:27.000> go

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
try the game this is a great way to go

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.779 
try the game this is a great way to go
so<00:00:28.170> first<00:00:28.439> the<00:00:28.890> idea<00:00:29.189> behind<00:00:29.340> a<00:00:29.519> wooden

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
so first the idea behind a wooden

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.569 
so first the idea behind a wooden
labyrinth<00:00:29.970> is<00:00:30.330> to<00:00:30.660> move<00:00:30.810> a<00:00:30.960> metal<00:00:31.230> ball<00:00:31.579> turn

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
labyrinth is to move a metal ball turn

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.420 
labyrinth is to move a metal ball turn
into<00:00:32.880> a<00:00:32.910> prescribed<00:00:33.739> hole<00:00:34.739> through<00:00:35.190> a<00:00:35.219> lot<00:00:35.399> of

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
into a prescribed hole through a lot of

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.850 
into a prescribed hole through a lot of
obstacles<00:00:35.700> it's<00:00:36.270> a<00:00:36.840> simple<00:00:36.960> contact<00:00:37.559> but<00:00:37.739> it's

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
obstacles it's a simple contact but it's

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.950 
obstacles it's a simple contact but it's
relatively<00:00:38.219> fun<00:00:38.520> I<00:00:38.760> actually<00:00:39.180> grew<00:00:39.510> up<00:00:39.660> with<00:00:39.930> a

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
relatively fun I actually grew up with a

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.080 
relatively fun I actually grew up with a
wooden<00:00:40.290> labyrinth<00:00:40.530> in<00:00:40.860> my<00:00:40.950> parents<00:00:41.489> home<00:00:41.670> so<00:00:42.059> I

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
wooden labyrinth in my parents home so I

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.810 
wooden labyrinth in my parents home so I
kind<00:00:42.719> of<00:00:42.750> have<00:00:42.870> a<00:00:42.899> soft<00:00:43.110> spot<00:00:43.320> for<00:00:43.860> these<00:00:43.890> so

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
kind of have a soft spot for these so

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.959 
kind of have a soft spot for these so
let<00:00:44.910> me<00:00:45.000> show<00:00:45.090> you<00:00:45.120> some<00:00:45.329> of<00:00:45.360> the<00:00:45.480> options<00:00:45.600> you

00:00:46.959 --> 00:00:46.969 
let me show you some of the options you

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:49.160 
let me show you some of the options you
can<00:00:47.969> turn<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.270> sound<00:00:48.420> effects<00:00:48.750> on<00:00:48.930> and<00:00:49.079> off

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
can turn the sound effects on and off

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.049 
can turn the sound effects on and off
music<00:00:49.559> on<00:00:49.770> and<00:00:49.950> off<00:00:50.039> friction<00:00:50.610> you<00:00:50.879> can

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
music on and off friction you can

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.900 
music on and off friction you can
control<00:00:51.559> sensitivity<00:00:52.559> endless<00:00:53.399> mode<00:00:53.670> holes

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
control sensitivity endless mode holes

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.220 
control sensitivity endless mode holes
so<00:00:54.090> that<00:00:54.149> can<00:00:54.360> make<00:00:54.449> the<00:00:54.570> level<00:00:54.840> crazy

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
so that can make the level crazy

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.430 
so that can make the level crazy
difficult<00:00:56.030> 3d<00:00:57.030> effects<00:00:57.510> shake<00:00:57.780> to<00:00:57.960> jump<00:00:58.260> or

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
difficult 3d effects shake to jump or

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.360 
difficult 3d effects shake to jump or
tag<00:00:59.070> to<00:00:59.309> jump<00:01:00.980> essentially<00:01:01.980> what<00:01:02.070> that<00:01:02.100> means

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
tag to jump essentially what that means

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.280 
tag to jump essentially what that means
you<00:01:02.489> can<00:01:02.640> shake<00:01:02.879> the<00:01:03.000> device<00:01:03.239> and<00:01:03.390> have<00:01:04.140> the

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
you can shake the device and have the

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.260 
you can shake the device and have the
ball<00:01:04.470> jump<00:01:04.860> on<00:01:05.040> certain<00:01:05.339> levels<00:01:05.369> let<00:01:06.090> me<00:01:06.150> show

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
ball jump on certain levels let me show

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.960 
ball jump on certain levels let me show
you<00:01:06.330> what<00:01:06.450> a<00:01:06.479> level<00:01:06.720> looks<00:01:06.840> like<00:01:07.820> so<00:01:08.820> we'll

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
you what a level looks like so we'll

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.580 
you what a level looks like so we'll
pick<00:01:09.270> when<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:09.960> first<00:01:10.170> one<00:01:10.350> is<00:01:10.380> easy

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
pick when the first one is easy

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.109 
pick when the first one is easy
breathing<00:01:13.010> no<00:01:14.010> pressure<00:01:14.280> so<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:14.729> goal<00:01:14.880> is<00:01:14.909> to

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
breathing no pressure so the goal is to

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.840 
breathing no pressure so the goal is to
get<00:01:15.240> there<00:01:16.170> into<00:01:17.070> that<00:01:17.189> little<00:01:17.369> checkered

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
get there into that little checkered

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.880 
get there into that little checkered
hole<00:01:18.000> and<00:01:18.299> certainly<00:01:19.140> just<00:01:19.320> takes<00:01:19.470> advantage

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
hole and certainly just takes advantage

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.710 
hole and certainly just takes advantage
of<00:01:20.009> the<00:01:20.340> built-in<00:01:20.790> accelerometer<00:01:21.090> on<00:01:21.570> here

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
of the built-in accelerometer on here

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:22.760 
of the built-in accelerometer on here
and<00:01:21.780> you'll<00:01:21.900> see<00:01:22.049> that<00:01:22.080> as<00:01:22.290> I'm<00:01:22.409> moving<00:01:22.560> this

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
and you'll see that as I'm moving this

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.830 
and you'll see that as I'm moving this
around<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:23.479> barrier<00:01:24.479> start<00:01:24.689> to<00:01:24.750> look

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
around the barrier start to look

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.980 
around the barrier start to look
three-dimensional<00:01:26.330> which<00:01:27.330> is<00:01:27.450> kind<00:01:27.750> of<00:01:27.810> needs

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
three-dimensional which is kind of needs

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.120 
three-dimensional which is kind of needs
really<00:01:28.259> get<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:28.439> feeling<00:01:28.770> that<00:01:28.799> you're<00:01:29.009> not

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
really get the feeling that you're not

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.620 
really get the feeling that you're not
just<00:01:29.280> using<00:01:29.310> a<00:01:29.579> two-dimensional<00:01:30.150> plane<00:01:30.360> I

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
just using a two-dimensional plane I

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.190 
just using a two-dimensional plane I
will<00:01:31.439> try<00:01:31.619> and<00:01:31.710> navigate<00:01:32.630> not<00:01:33.630> successfully

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
will try and navigate not successfully

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.539 
will try and navigate not successfully
trying<00:01:34.439> to<00:01:34.500> do<00:01:34.560> it<00:01:34.619> through<00:01:34.829> the<00:01:34.920> camera<00:01:35.070> lens

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:37.549 

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:41.530 

let's<00:01:38.549> see

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:41.540 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:45.370 

and<00:01:42.200> now<00:01:42.970> but<00:01:43.970> you<00:01:44.150> guys<00:01:44.240> get<00:01:44.420> the<00:01:44.600> idea<00:01:44.810> of

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380 
and now but you guys get the idea of

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:46.780 
and now but you guys get the idea of
what<00:01:45.530> the<00:01:45.650> wooden<00:01:45.920> labyrinth<00:01:46.070> game<00:01:46.250> is<00:01:46.520> it<00:01:46.700> is

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:46.790 
what the wooden labyrinth game is it is
