00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.640
 I throw away the liquid 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:31.479

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:45.679
 never vanilla I already have the starch 

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:47.090
 vehicular 

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:51.100
 see you last week did one 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:51.100
 of rose petals 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:02:02.079
 there is a lady by the balcony 

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:13.400
 heart now we go with the grenetina the 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.319
 grenetina which is a spoonful and up 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:18.349
 of living 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:20.180
 so hydrated nothing and here to fire it 

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:22.340
 is going to undo let's go up the little game 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.920
 let's make this until it thickens 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:27.250
 once it thickens and it's already in its 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:34.860
 consistency I'm going to put 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:37.050
 the candy puts color to the person 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:41.340
 let's put a droplet of yellow one 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:44.519
 motivated drop more than another of vanilla and 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:46.840
 is older and here I have 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:49.629
 candy you can do it at home 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:51.189
 many times candy then I say that 

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:53.519
 If it's business you have to buy these from 

00:02:51.189 --> 00:02:53.519
 liter 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:01.420
 doing it takes your time 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:03.099
 to put the gas 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:04.450
 all of this they are counting are tiny 

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:05.920
 an account but count at the end of 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:08.330
 bills 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:13.940
 in the end 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:16.820
 50 finish 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:19.310
 do not scold me through the facebook paste 

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:22.760
 to the object or our product 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:25.300
 please hurry me and I brought a few days 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.300
 so done 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:33.260
 it is very easy 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:35.300
 really find others on the internet 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:38.530
 that they lay eggs and that's more like 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:38.530
 for me it's a custard 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:43.430
 because no eggs because when 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:45.560
 they sell in stores they have them without 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:47.330
 refrigeration and in a single tray if 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:49.100
 obviously the product will take protein 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:54.710
 it breaks down smarter faster 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:57.040
 you are learning with this is totally 

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:57.040
 true 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:04.210
 to me it will touch 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:07.350
 delicious 

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:10.690
 yes i can be 

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:12.400
 tiernito tiernito and the truth is super 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:14.610
 coexisting me is for me to do this 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.610
 all right 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:18.840
 um 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:25.710
 for the cornstarch that we want and believe 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:27.389
 hospira needs so much milk ok 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:29.099
 obviously that's why its cost is quite 

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:31.470
 low ok let's put here is 

00:04:29.099 --> 00:04:32.699
 delicious for almost nothing and we learned the 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:34.440
