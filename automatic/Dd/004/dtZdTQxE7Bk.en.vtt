at<00:01:36.350> the<00:01:36.380> moment<00:01:36.770> you're<00:01:37.280> flicking<00:01:37.520> about<00:01:37.790> the

other way and this is really quick and

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:40.960 
other way and this is really quick and
then<00:01:40.220> we're<00:01:40.310> coming<00:01:40.520> up<00:01:40.580> to<00:01:40.640> still<00:01:40.850> in

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:40.970 
then we're coming up to still in

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:42.610 
then we're coming up to still in
sections<00:01:41.360> where<00:01:41.540> they've<00:01:41.660> changed<00:01:41.930> it<00:01:42.200> done<00:01:42.590> a

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:42.620 
sections where they've changed it done a

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:44.860 
sections where they've changed it done a
lot<00:01:42.740> of<00:01:42.830> earthworks<00:01:43.310> so<00:01:44.270> this<00:01:44.450> used<00:01:44.690> to<00:01:44.750> be

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:44.870 
lot of earthworks so this used to be

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:46.420 
lot of earthworks so this used to be
really<00:01:45.080> open<00:01:45.320> they've<00:01:45.740> tightened<00:01:46.010> it<00:01:46.220> up<00:01:46.340> a

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:46.430 
really open they've tightened it up a

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:49.780 
really open they've tightened it up a
bit<00:01:46.460> on<00:01:47.060> here<00:01:47.810> and<00:01:48.050> then<00:01:48.560> on<00:01:48.710> the<00:01:49.130> exits<00:01:49.580> you

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:49.790 
bit on here and then on the exits you

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:52.390 
bit on here and then on the exits you
can't<00:01:50.000> now<00:01:50.210> cut<00:01:50.750> across<00:01:51.020> that<00:01:51.080> corner<00:01:51.680> which

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:52.400 
can't now cut across that corner which

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.820 
can't now cut across that corner which
you<00:01:52.580> used<00:01:52.730> to<00:01:52.820> be<00:01:53.000> able<00:01:53.090> to<00:01:53.360> now<00:01:54.260> get<00:01:54.410> straight

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:54.830 
you used to be able to now get straight

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:57.430 
you used to be able to now get straight
run<00:01:55.070> into<00:01:55.310> what<00:01:55.430> used<00:01:55.640> to<00:01:55.730> be<00:01:55.790> Bank<00:01:56.720> that's

don't to get too greedy too early run up
the<00:02:01.850> apex<00:02:02.180> there<00:02:02.360> rather<00:02:02.840> that's<00:02:03.080> the<00:02:03.320> exit

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:03.680 
the apex there rather that's the exit

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.740 
the apex there rather that's the exit
here<00:02:03.920> and<00:02:04.880> then<00:02:05.120> you've<00:02:05.240> got<00:02:05.330> this<00:02:05.420> long

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:05.750 
here and then you've got this long

carbon<00:03:24.569> brakes<00:03:24.750> on<00:03:25.680> this<00:03:25.860> gt3<00:03:27.170> you<00:03:28.170> can<00:03:28.349> really

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
carbon brakes on this gt3 you can really

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:31.369 
carbon brakes on this gt3 you can really
lean<00:03:29.160> on<00:03:29.190> them<00:03:29.599> it's<00:03:30.599> one<00:03:30.750> of<00:03:30.840> the<00:03:30.900> best<00:03:31.170> things

00:03:31.369 --> 00:03:31.379

about<00:03:31.470> this<00:03:31.709> car<00:03:31.890> I<00:03:31.950> think<00:03:32.160> it's<00:03:32.250> just<00:03:32.459> the<00:03:32.610> way

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
about this car I think it's just the way

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:39.020 
about this car I think it's just the way
you<00:03:33.060> can<00:03:33.300> break<00:03:33.540> into<00:03:33.720> the<00:03:33.900> corners<00:03:34.319> now<00:03:38.030> take

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
you can break into the corners now take

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:40.430 
you can break into the corners now take
a<00:03:39.060> bit<00:03:39.299> more<00:03:39.330> curb<00:03:39.690> there<00:03:39.959> I'm<00:03:40.110> used<00:03:40.319> to

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
a bit more curb there I'm used to

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.080 
a bit more curb there I'm used to
driving<00:03:40.680> this<00:03:40.980> circuit<00:03:41.370> for<00:03:41.400> lap<00:03:41.640> times<00:03:41.910> when
