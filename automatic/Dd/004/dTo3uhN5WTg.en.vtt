00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:48.400 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.090 

you<00:01:48.910> want<00:01:49.060> to<00:01:49.180> do<00:01:49.330> the<00:01:49.480> quicker<00:01:49.720> way<00:01:49.990> you<00:01:50.890> just

you want to do the quicker way you just

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.910 
you want to do the quicker way you just
so<00:01:51.310> it<00:01:51.460> straight<00:01:51.760> across<00:01:52.000> with<00:01:52.450> them<00:01:52.890> with<00:01:53.890> a

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:53.920 
so it straight across with them with a

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.940 
so it straight across with them with a
sewing<00:01:54.220> machine<00:01:55.260> because<00:01:56.260> it<00:01:56.410> takes<00:01:56.620> a<00:01:56.800> little

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:56.950 
sewing machine because it takes a little

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:03.600 
sewing machine because it takes a little
time<00:02:01.080> now<00:02:02.080> when<00:02:02.260> you<00:02:02.290> reach<00:02:02.530> the<00:02:02.770> end<00:02:02.800> of<00:02:03.310> your

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:03.610 
time now when you reach the end of your

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:06.810 
time now when you reach the end of your
opening<00:02:04.800> you're<00:02:05.800> going<00:02:06.130> to<00:02:06.310> go<00:02:06.460> through<00:02:06.790> that

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:06.820 
opening you're going to go through that

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:10.620 
opening you're going to go through that
last<00:02:07.180> time<00:02:07.600> and<00:02:07.870> then<00:02:09.119> you're<00:02:10.119> going<00:02:10.300> to<00:02:10.390> get

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:10.630 
last time and then you're going to get

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:14.700 
last time and then you're going to get
another<00:02:11.130> loop<00:02:12.130> here<00:02:12.550> and<00:02:13.080> then<00:02:14.080> just<00:02:14.470> take

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:14.710 
another loop here and then just take

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:17.250 
another loop here and then just take
this<00:02:14.950> little<00:02:15.910> loop<00:02:16.030> of<00:02:16.330> thread<00:02:16.570> that<00:02:16.900> you<00:02:17.110> have

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
this little loop of thread that you have

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.170 
this little loop of thread that you have
left<00:02:17.560> and<00:02:17.800> loop<00:02:17.980> it<00:02:18.130> over<00:02:18.280> that<00:02:18.580> and<00:02:19.000> do<00:02:19.150> that

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
left and loop it over that and do that

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:24.090 
left and loop it over that and do that
about<00:02:19.570> twice<00:02:19.900> and<00:02:20.260> that'll<00:02:20.500> tie<00:02:20.680> not<00:02:22.890> just<00:02:23.890> tie

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:24.100 
about twice and that'll tie not just tie

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.580 
about twice and that'll tie not just tie
the<00:02:24.160> rent<00:02:24.690> put<00:02:25.690> it<00:02:25.810> around<00:02:25.930> the<00:02:26.140> end<00:02:26.380> and

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
the rent put it around the end and

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:29.150 
the rent put it around the end and
there's<00:02:27.100> your<00:02:27.280> not<00:02:27.430> and<00:02:28.120> that<00:02:28.209> ties<00:02:28.450> it<00:02:28.690> off

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
there's your not and that ties it off

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:35.490 
there's your not and that ties it off
and<00:02:30.160> cut<00:02:30.340> it<00:02:30.840> your<00:02:31.840> three<00:02:33.959> and<00:02:34.959> there's<00:02:35.320> your

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
and cut it your three and there's your

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.209
