00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:21.600 
and they're screaming and excitement so
he<00:04:18.670> needs<00:04:18.880> to<00:04:19.030> learn<00:04:19.120> from<00:04:19.360> them<00:04:20.459> all<00:04:21.459> the

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:21.610 
he needs to learn from them all the

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:23.970 
he needs to learn from them all the
atmosphere<00:04:22.150> is<00:04:22.300> it<00:04:22.990> gives<00:04:23.230> you<00:04:23.350> loads<00:04:23.650> and

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:23.980 
atmosphere is it gives you loads and

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:26.670 
atmosphere is it gives you loads and
loads<00:04:24.010> of<00:04:24.340> energy<00:04:24.700> and<00:04:25.000> so<00:04:25.600> it<00:04:25.960> gives<00:04:26.170> loads<00:04:26.500> of

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:26.680 
loads of energy and so it gives loads of

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:28.470 
loads of energy and so it gives loads of
energy<00:04:26.800> to<00:04:27.130> the<00:04:27.250> dog<00:04:27.400> as<00:04:27.550> well<00:04:27.700> especially<00:04:27.940> my

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:28.480 
energy to the dog as well especially my

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:30.240 
energy to the dog as well especially my
dog<00:04:28.720> because<00:04:28.960> they<00:04:29.170> are<00:04:29.230> very<00:04:29.500> useful<00:04:29.680> already

the flower starts and people are
starting<00:04:35.200> to<00:04:35.290> whistle<00:04:35.740> and<00:04:35.890> I<00:04:35.950> really<00:04:36.190> need<00:04:36.340> to

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:36.520 
starting to whistle and I really need to

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:39.180 
starting to whistle and I really need to
contain<00:04:37.450> him<00:04:37.690> but<00:04:38.230> it<00:04:38.350> gives<00:04:38.500> me<00:04:38.590> energy<00:04:38.890> in

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:39.190 
contain him but it gives me energy in

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:41.070 
contain him but it gives me energy in
him<00:04:39.370> as<00:04:39.490> well<00:04:39.520> so<00:04:39.940> it<00:04:40.060> works<00:04:40.390> harder<00:04:40.780> as<00:04:40.870> well

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:41.080 
him as well so it works harder as well

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:43.980 
him as well so it works harder as well
and<00:04:41.290> it<00:04:41.380> also<00:04:41.680> counts<00:04:42.430> with<00:04:42.610> those<00:04:42.910> dogs<00:04:43.150> some

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:43.990

dogs are getting he's getting up high up
when<00:04:46.840> there<00:04:46.960> is<00:04:47.080> lots<00:04:47.380> of<00:04:47.470> noise<00:04:47.710> because<00:04:48.250> he

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:48.370 
when there is lots of noise because he

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:51.270 
when there is lots of noise because he
can't<00:04:48.580> handle<00:04:48.910> it<00:04:49.180> very<00:04:49.450> good<00:04:50.050> he<00:04:50.770> comes<00:04:51.010> and

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:51.280 
can't handle it very good he comes and
