00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:18.449
 I chose to urbanize this because it was 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.070
 everything last minute for me I was 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.550
 Searching I saw the video on the internet 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:25.980
 also on the globe of the club talking 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.410
 I was interested and it was the one I chose 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.900
 I identified 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:33.680
 It was the best option here. 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:37.440
 better cover my needs 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:39.180
 dreams structure needs you 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.309
 that there was in buenos aires would have 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.670
 where you know the whole structure that 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:46.860
 is behind his dream and what he gives in 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.450
 your heart to realize this dream with 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.930
 I live in Buenos Aires 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.340
 Good, I intend to get out of here. 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.129
 professional right? 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.289
 and from what I saw buenos aires I can 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.600
 realize this dream with the company she 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:05.670
 will help me and will support from the start 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:07.890
 end, and finally the endorsement I 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:11.670
 I needed to build my dream is 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:16.229
 this is what i hope uÃ© family 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:18.930
 importance of family support is 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:21.180
 it's essential because I came to stay 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.700
 Alone not knowing anything I've never lived 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.170
 away from home so my parents me 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.700
 supporting because my parents who 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.400
 I came here because they did not 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.770
 I wanted to live here stay away from home but 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.590
 I'm here he 's giving me a 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:37.950
 force and I will stay with the family 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:40.170
 dreams dream goals looked like something 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:44.700
 abstract but today is reality 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:48.180
 the European global acceptance system 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.910
 today you are just like it burns in the 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:54.780
 this heart 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:02:00.570
 our land shifted up to refined thing 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:03.390
 who does not even have to talk is not without 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:05.640
 words so that we have a 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:09.600
 very good opportunity is not here 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:11.760
 difficult sometimes people speak our 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.290
 but for another country is not so difficult is 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.500
 something very close at least the 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:19.430
 Brazil is waiting for something that is not easy. 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:23.660
 It's so difficult, he has to study. 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:26.840
 but nothing impossible many people 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:30.959
 They tried to discourage me. 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:33.570
 issues have been stolen here 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:35.520
 I was going back to work in Brazil. 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:37.740
 But one thing I say if I show up. 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:39.360
 opportunity you can not lose 

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:40.500
 You have to move on and you have 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.250
 to fight for what you want to be 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.690
 in the future 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.959
 then the rest of the way unprepared 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:48.930
 ways 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:50.760
 today you have and those people who 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:52.780
 still do not have that path 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.550
 a word 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:59.110
 for those people who do not have this 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:03:01.060
 way a word I give is God 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:03.580
 if you have god in your heart you have 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:05.620
 a goal you ask him to give you 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:07.930
 it forwards the way 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.160
 You have to follow and you do not have to. 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:12.340
 have nothing else 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:15.000
 have to believe that the supreme self 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:17.530
 I imagined that I would be here today. 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:21.760
 have to trust and believe because it is 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:22.810
 possible if you want something 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.770
 different 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:25.770
 do it yourself
