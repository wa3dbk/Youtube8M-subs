00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:05.670
 hey hello swami john effect this 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:09.440
 dispute, or I'll show you how to create one in 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.440
 such a blue-ray is not 4d 

00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:15.330
 it's done quite easily these videos 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:20.160
 specially prepared for this 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:22.289
 tutorial so well let's get on well 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.630
 take for example this block it will be 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:27.840
 you are in the middle of the bed, she will take 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:30.210
 somewhere behind us and take perhaps 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.870
 hydrogen clay blog or whatever it is 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:37.129
 so let's place it somewhere 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:43.829
 somewhere here for example fine 

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:47.190
 now let's create a camera we 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:51.480
 created click and go right away and 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:53.699
 after the conclusion we do not know about you but me 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.520
 like to print on 720 people 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:58.020
 format cities 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:01.260
 breaking sex 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:03.420
 now if we want us to have 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.040
 size well so only this one is blurred 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.100
 pastel she is behind all these 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:11.369
 objects then go to the details choose 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:14.040
 blurred from behind yes now into object 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:17.220
 distance to the target and mark it 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.560
 about here until here well we mean 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.340
 marked a point and everything will be behind it 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.380
 blurred 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.659
 let's see yes no we are not yet 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.960
 we can see as we have not added 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:32.299
 the effect of depth of field principle here 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:34.860
 do not exchange anything so it looks like 

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:36.840
 It looks like this. 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.939
 open but if we want us to still 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.130
 there was a different front we save 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:44.090
 again in detail blur in front and 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:48.570
 press the middle mouse button and 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:52.170
 go to the top mode and look yes 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:56.430
 here we have a slider and here we too 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:59.119
 slider green green light green 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:01.310
 prices show camera visibility 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:05.399
 dark green what will be blurred 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:07.439
 so in our case, what is here 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:09.800
 behind these two stripes it will be 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:14.000
 blurred back here 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:17.570
 and this is impossible by the way it's impossible 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.640
 for not yes and this is this slider 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:22.880
 with dark stripes on what will be 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:27.320
 blurred before we set here so that's how 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:29.600
 to closing where something like this takes place 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:33.070
 hell with this block let's see 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.070
 how it will look when rendered 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:39.200
 henry have you looked like this that is 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:42.140
 crashed due 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:47.420
 block and front block now if we 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:49.310
 want to make an animation say for example 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:51.140
 he also has a camera first 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:53.120
 focuses on this subject afterwards 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:56.690
 go to this and then on the bed 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:59.090
 to enter the camera in the object section and 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:01.120
 distance to the goal who go into mode 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:03.310
 on top of 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:06.370
 the distance to the goal we will first be 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:15.230
 here it is 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:18.230
 For example, this is how well we put the key on 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:21.530
 clamped control and will find a button 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:24.890
 after but we will have the same 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:29.180
 hold up to focal neighbor take up 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:32.450
 5 frames again put the key then on the 15th 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:36.920
 the frame we have already goes to the range 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:41.000
 here is this block on the middle here we are again 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:42.340
 we put the cue then 20 also we have a focus 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.430
 stick 5 frames 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:53.720
 after that he will switch to us already 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:55.700
 last block so that's great 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:59.000
 that is, this is the distance 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:00.560
 well here it is this area she will 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.260
 which is normally focused 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:06.070
 is right here and right there already 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:09.550
 will be a boy so be careful 

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:09.550
 now we look 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:16.810
 that is, we have mylts at all. 

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:19.329
 that front but behind we have 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:25.050
 focus on this block let's do here 

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:29.560
 so here's a great copy of this key 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:33.210
 Now we look at everything carefully heavy 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:37.030
 here you can also do a little further 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:41.289
 here so for example also we take we copy 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:43.650
 this key and now let's see what 

00:04:41.289 --> 00:04:47.770
 well we will have with the last bow before all 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:51.070
 he is not good let's see how 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:54.880
 will look when rendered and brands 

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:57.699
 No, I will not save the tabernacle frame 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:05:01.900
 manually and to what extent do we take 

00:04:57.699 --> 00:05:09.760
 up to 40 1 second 15 mini seconds so from 0 1 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:12.010
 and 15 will also be a Vendric 360 so that it 

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:14.639
 I did not take much time let's 

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:19.020
 let's see so render 

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:19.020
 until continue without saving 

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:31.860
 as you see, at first we are fine 

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:37.500
 Blurry 2 block then passes 5 frames 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:42.420
 and already the street is gradually moving to this 

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:45.690
 the block then goes through another 5 frames and 

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:49.040
 Mylets is already moving to the near two 

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:51.780
 block and this bed is also there outside 

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:57.630
 retirement here such we have turned out 

00:05:51.780 --> 00:06:04.440
 the animation goes into focus swim with 

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:06.780
 this block on this one and from this on this well 

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:09.810
