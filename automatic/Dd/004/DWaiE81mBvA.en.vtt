used are glass droplets which come

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.190 
used are glass droplets which come
pre-wired<00:01:41.610> so<00:01:42.299> they<00:01:42.450> take<00:01:42.689> a<00:01:42.720> little<00:01:43.020> more

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200

work and you simply curl the wire around
the<00:01:46.380> branch<00:01:46.649> and<00:01:47.100> these<00:01:47.490> are<00:01:47.640> great<00:01:47.850> for

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
the branch and these are great for

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.210 
the branch and these are great for
smaller<00:01:48.420> branches<00:01:48.990> because<00:01:49.290> you<00:01:49.439> can<00:01:49.590> pack<00:01:49.920> on

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
smaller branches because you can pack on
