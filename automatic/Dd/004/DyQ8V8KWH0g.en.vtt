00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:06.899
 of the nerve we are going to make him lose 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:09.170
 Nerves or the streets to get out more 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:16.700
 fast before it counts down 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:16.700
 the motherfucker use it 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:32.420
 with a part of the skull that the 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:34.489
 motorcycle listen to me because these are 

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:39.050
 visits 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:39.050
 when they suffer falls are well 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:45.550
 29 gallons with the tree 

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:55.570
 it's not worth worth 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:06.200
 do it upstairs goodbye until later 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:09.400
 Maybe it is that the workflow 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:13.760
 I do not know why 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:18.070
 that we do not arrive I'm Jesus Christ in 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:18.070
 bicycle let's fuck 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:38.560
 they are all vocalist 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.570
 I do not believe because I'm going last that good 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:58.170
 and if the bicycle does not come to Mohammed 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:00.460
 let's sell to the bicycle 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:03.960

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:03.960
 good hours bike sleeves 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:10.490

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:32.900
 Fernando are the races do not need a 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:32.900
 man for his pleasure 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.720
 yes 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:50.470
 a very bad you can not compete against my 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:50.470
 many minutes overtake me 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.370
 but what's wrong 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:04.060
 the reason is that they were moving forward now 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:04.060
 to him 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:15.260

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:17.799
 dead not once or is it good 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.799
 from a while ago 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:29.120
 has gone all the way to the head with 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:43.239
 the wheels overtaking the head 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:43.239
 but as I have not done it 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:57.090
 against the pole 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:08.200
 or both 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:08.200
 nothing negative about txiki tensions 

00:04:12.189 --> 00:04:19.479
 gave him advances and ruined me and I 

00:04:27.789 --> 00:04:38.199
 win me but calm 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:51.490
