00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:16.209 
changing the front shocks out of a 99
Ford<00:00:13.250> Crown<00:00:13.550> Victoria<00:00:14.559> this<00:00:15.559> is<00:00:15.709> the<00:00:15.799> top<00:00:16.039> of

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:16.219 
Ford Crown Victoria this is the top of

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:20.770 
Ford Crown Victoria this is the top of
the<00:00:16.280> front<00:00:16.490> shock<00:00:16.760> mount<00:00:17.090> and<00:00:19.420> you<00:00:20.420> have<00:00:20.600> the

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:20.780 
the front shock mount and you have the

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:26.680 
the front shock mount and you have the
top<00:00:20.960> actually<00:00:22.840> double<00:00:23.840> nutted<00:00:24.200> here<00:00:24.530> and<00:00:25.690> 9/16

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:26.690 
top actually double nutted here and 9/16

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:28.660 
top actually double nutted here and 9/16
and<00:00:26.780> 14<00:00:27.200> millimeters<00:00:27.710> are<00:00:27.860> very<00:00:28.070> very<00:00:28.250> similar

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:28.670 
and 14 millimeters are very very similar

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:32.440 
and 14 millimeters are very very similar
so<00:00:29.330> you<00:00:29.410> lock<00:00:30.410> in<00:00:30.680> with<00:00:30.890> the<00:00:30.980> 9/16<00:00:31.970> on<00:00:32.210> the

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:32.450 
so you lock in with the 9/16 on the

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:34.600 
so you lock in with the 9/16 on the
bottom<00:00:32.780> and<00:00:33.020> then<00:00:33.410> the<00:00:33.530> strategy<00:00:34.040> is<00:00:34.190> to<00:00:34.340> use

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:34.610 
bottom and then the strategy is to use

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:37.930 
bottom and then the strategy is to use
an<00:00:35.450> extension<00:00:36.440> for<00:00:36.829> the<00:00:36.920> 14<00:00:37.340> millimeter<00:00:37.760> on<00:00:37.879> a

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:37.940 
an extension for the 14 millimeter on a

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.540 
an extension for the 14 millimeter on a
ratchet<00:00:38.510> in<00:00:38.809> order<00:00:39.110> to<00:00:39.200> get<00:00:39.410> that<00:00:39.860> double<00:00:40.340> nut

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:42.550 
ratchet in order to get that double nut

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:47.350 
ratchet in order to get that double nut
so<00:00:43.550> underneath<00:00:44.120> the<00:00:44.420> car<00:00:44.660> the<00:00:45.590> shock<00:00:46.030> is<00:00:47.030> held

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:47.360 
so underneath the car the shock is held

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:53.080 
so underneath the car the shock is held
on<00:00:48.910> like<00:00:49.910> two<00:00:50.090> bolts<00:00:51.340> one<00:00:52.340> on<00:00:52.489> this<00:00:52.640> side<00:00:52.850> one

also easy to remove but the bottom one

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.179 
also easy to remove but the bottom one
is<00:01:43.040> is<00:01:43.430> difficult<00:01:43.939> so<00:01:44.540> what<00:01:45.530> you<00:01:45.799> have<00:01:45.920> to<00:01:45.979> do

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:46.189 
is is difficult so what you have to do

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:48.880 
is is difficult so what you have to do
is<00:01:46.400> you<00:01:46.520> have<00:01:46.580> to<00:01:46.700> set<00:01:47.000> it<00:01:47.119> up<00:01:47.240> with<00:01:47.590> vice<00:01:48.590> grips

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
is you have to set it up with vice grips

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:56.289 
is you have to set it up with vice grips
to<00:01:49.130> grab<00:01:50.060> the<00:01:50.210> top<00:01:50.450> and<00:01:50.930> then<00:01:51.409> use<00:01:51.740> a<00:01:53.680> 9/16<00:01:55.299> open

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:56.299 
to grab the top and then use a 9/16 open

00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:01.440 
to grab the top and then use a 9/16 open
end<00:01:56.479> in<00:01:56.659> order<00:01:57.200> to<00:01:57.409> remove<00:01:57.979> the<00:01:58.280> bottom<00:01:59.150> that

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.450 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:08.559 

so<00:02:02.450> once<00:02:02.720> the<00:02:03.520> bottom<00:02:04.520> nut<00:02:04.700> is<00:02:04.880> removed<00:02:07.569> you'll

00:02:08.559 --> 00:02:08.569 
so once the bottom nut is removed you'll

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:10.240 
so once the bottom nut is removed you'll
have<00:02:08.720> a<00:02:08.750> washer

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250
