00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.789
 bringing a tutorial of how to download 

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:24.130
 internet books 

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:27.329
 first they go to the page that they 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:27.329
 I will leave in the description 

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.890
 paste and search 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:43.339
 since they entered that they will look like a 

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:48.890
 video just close them and the name 

00:00:43.339 --> 00:00:52.899

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:52.899
 tüttös david 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:59.260
 this is so that all the 

00:00:55.789 --> 00:01:01.989
 registration process and that 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:05.290
 I came up with an idea of ​​what to do 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:08.070
 account and share it with everyone 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:08.070

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:12.080

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:29.939
 and he expects his address market and 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:34.250

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:34.250
 title or author 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:41.370
 I give them my account password 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:44.160
 because I'm trusting that you do not 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:46.560
 they are going to misuse this so that 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:49.860

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:59.450
 As you can see, it takes a little while to find 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.730
 the book but I guess it's normal 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:04.600
