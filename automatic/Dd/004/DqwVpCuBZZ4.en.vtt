00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.840
 Hello everyone, I sang this part 60 

00:00:09.639 --> 00:00:13.360
 minecraft engine 

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:16.059
 in this part but it is like a jubilee 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:18.910
 part but you do not worry me every 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:21.369
 series that ends on legs so 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:24.000
 or else call pancakes this series you 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:27.370
 I will show such a mechanism, press the lever 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:31.510
 the door opens and the descent of the mystery yes 

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:34.530
 but then the steps are normal blocks in 

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:36.969
 In general, this 2 came up with 7b 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.550
 Well, I already did a tutorial on his 

00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:42.820
 the mechanism is a simple matter of their in Russian so 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:45.339
 it is necessary so it is necessary so cool and today 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:48.159
 I will teach you how to make a system like it 

00:00:45.339 --> 00:00:50.499
 the middle looks very compact very 

00:00:48.159 --> 00:00:55.989
 I do not know how he put it all so 

00:00:50.499 --> 00:00:57.879
 compact but let's get started so 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:01.389
 that we wo n't need it here 

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:05.140
 then we will need to move a little bit all 

00:01:01.389 --> 00:01:07.270
 I am ready to mean that I do the strain we 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:13.870
 will we do will do this door 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:17.560
 it means just a block here is another block 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:21.780
 here is the repeater on 4 here on the 1st here 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:25.300
 rexton here torch redstone 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:28.590
 here the torch which inversion does here 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:33.720
 so rises here two repeaters 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:37.570
 here, too, the torch is delayed by 3 blocks 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:39.310
 put here the piston here the piston signal 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:41.710
 through the piston will be transmitted not 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:44.290
 hurting him i mean he won't 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:47.740
 activate that this here torch and then 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:48.430
 cost there is a piston here like this 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.400
 introduced 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:56.020
 here so we do then here so here 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:02:00.730
 We put on 3 delay and Peter here on 2 here 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:02.750
 that's how here here so here so here 

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:05.240
 need to do later 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:11.390
 here is sticky piston here is sticky 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:14.690
 piston and here block m ordinary piston 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:18.860
 ordinary piston sticky tapes sticky 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:23.420
 sticky sticky sticky sweat here still so 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:28.220
 3 sticky now go by did not want 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:30.370
 sneeze will not work so then here 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:33.650
 Now dig this survey 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:37.160
 here so we carry redstone here peter on 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:41.470
 one delay here at 4 here we are all 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:43.400
 close the case so then we are here 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:47.239
 Redstone from this unit will be 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:52.090
 energize here delay for 3 here 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:55.330
 delay by 4 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:58.970
 here and here redstone 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:03:02.870
 then what else do we need like yes 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:06.830
 how would everything really so here 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:11.470
 here we close here and then here 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:15.590
 also close everything and we still need 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:18.530
 stairs well stairs steps stairs 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:22.900
 put here on the sticky piston and on this 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:25.600
 sticky piston oh what's up there 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:28.940
 don't mane like mane 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:33.769
 so here we all enter that is our 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:41.470
 floor level and system activation 

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:48.690
 Well, let's say here and now we look 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:52.120
 so I'm somewhere on the file explicit 3:01 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:53.620
 sorry this is by the way 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:56.920
 was accidentally exposed 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:59.620
 all here is very important nowhere not to mess around 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:03.400
 the delay here when I first saw 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:04.990
 this door and I built it on the tutorial about 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:07.390
 first tried to build with me not 

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:09.130
 it turned out then I built there was 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:11.620
 card description and 

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:14.820
 The link in the map description was a link to 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:17.410
 map I downloaded it built about 

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:18.880
 even built like that 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:23.020
 mechanism built there 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:24.850
 but I still got the Kirov but 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:28.540
 in general, over time, I learned this 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:31.210
 do and here you taught and everything is cool then 

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:33.400
 there is like that for work and everything is like 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:34.980
 usually you can download the link from the map 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:37.690
 will be in the description 

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:39.880
 if he does not understand something, I think you 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:42.760
 something is still not clear and 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:45.010
 it's not my non-professionalism that 

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:48.970
 I said bad thing that 

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:51.430
 really a mechanism for such a bunch of delays 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:54.070
 need to remember where the delay is 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:57.490
 I remembered that you still have everything 

00:04:54.070 --> 00:05:01.060
 it's okay in general, as always with 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:03.760
 you were Bill I showed you today 

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:05.650
 awesome mechanism will also be too 

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:07.150
 ficken mechanism and don't forget 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:11.020
 subscribe if you still haven't 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:14.520
 signed in general thank you all for 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:14.520
 view and all bye
