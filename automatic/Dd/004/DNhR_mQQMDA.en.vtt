00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:10.699 
lipstick inside and that's reason wise
is<00:02:09.479> really<00:02:09.750> easy<00:02:09.929> for<00:02:10.110> you<00:02:10.200> to<00:02:10.319> pick<00:02:10.470> it<00:02:10.530> up

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
is really easy for you to pick it up

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.380 
is really easy for you to pick it up
although<00:02:11.009> the<00:02:11.370> colors<00:02:11.700> are<00:02:11.819> not

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
although the colors are not

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.020 
although the colors are not
exactly<00:02:12.930> the<00:02:13.080> match<00:02:13.290> it<00:02:13.680> tells<00:02:14.610> you<00:02:14.760> the<00:02:14.880> color

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
exactly the match it tells you the color

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.210 
exactly the match it tells you the color
so<00:02:15.420> if<00:02:15.660> let's<00:02:15.930> say<00:02:16.110> if<00:02:16.170> this<00:02:16.380> is<00:02:16.530> fuchsia<00:02:16.860> color

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
so if let's say if this is fuchsia color

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.550 
so if let's say if this is fuchsia color
it<00:02:17.490> might<00:02:17.670> be<00:02:17.880> a<00:02:17.910> little<00:02:18.060> tone<00:02:18.750> difference<00:02:19.080> of

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
it might be a little tone difference of

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.640 
it might be a little tone difference of
fuchsia<00:02:19.830> but<00:02:20.550> it's<00:02:20.670> still<00:02:20.850> fuchsia<00:02:21.209> I<00:02:21.650> really

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
fuchsia but it's still fuchsia I really

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.710 
fuchsia but it's still fuchsia I really
like<00:02:22.830> the<00:02:22.980> packaging<00:02:23.160> it's<00:02:23.790> extremely<00:02:24.480> classy

Jeni lipsticks are not priced at that

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:34.760 
Jeni lipsticks are not priced at that
sort<00:02:33.300> of<00:02:33.360> range<00:02:33.630> these<00:02:34.080> lipsticks<00:02:34.500> are

sort of range these lipsticks are
extremely<00:02:35.640> pigmented<00:02:36.270> and<00:02:36.630> they're<00:02:36.959> very

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
extremely pigmented and they're very

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.710 
extremely pigmented and they're very
very<00:02:37.410> moisturizing<00:02:38.040> Jade<00:02:38.640> the<00:02:38.820> only<00:02:39.150> downside

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
very moisturizing Jade the only downside

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.590 
very moisturizing Jade the only downside
of<00:02:39.989> these<00:02:40.140> lipsticks<00:02:40.650> is<00:02:40.890> that<00:02:41.819> because<00:02:42.450> it<00:02:42.540> is

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
of these lipsticks is that because it is

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.320 
of these lipsticks is that because it is
like<00:02:42.780> that's<00:02:42.989> so<00:02:43.200> creamy<00:02:43.560> it<00:02:43.890> is<00:02:44.250> it<00:02:44.580> transfers

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
like that's so creamy it is it transfers

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.840 
like that's so creamy it is it transfers
a<00:02:45.540> lot<00:02:45.900> say<00:02:46.440> if<00:02:46.500> you<00:02:46.620> have<00:02:46.860> this<00:02:47.040> on<00:02:47.250> on<00:02:47.700> your

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
a lot say if you have this on on your

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:49.130 
a lot say if you have this on on your
lips<00:02:48.120> if<00:02:48.300> you're<00:02:48.420> going<00:02:48.540> to<00:02:48.600> drink<00:02:48.840> anything

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
lips if you're going to drink anything

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:50.690 
lips if you're going to drink anything
if<00:02:49.350> you<00:02:49.440> eat<00:02:49.709> anything<00:02:50.040> it's<00:02:50.340> just<00:02:50.370> going<00:02:50.550> to

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
if you eat anything it's just going to

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.030 
if you eat anything it's just going to
transfer<00:02:50.880> very<00:02:51.840> very<00:02:52.140> quickly<00:02:52.380> so<00:02:52.530> that's<00:02:52.860> the

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
transfer very very quickly so that's the

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.220 
transfer very very quickly so that's the
only<00:02:53.220> downside<00:02:53.670> I<00:02:54.120> think<00:02:54.480> if<00:02:54.630> you<00:02:54.810> are<00:02:54.959> looking

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
only downside I think if you are looking

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.350 
only downside I think if you are looking
for<00:02:55.380> budget<00:02:55.680> lipsticks<00:02:56.220> and<00:02:56.430> if<00:02:56.820> you<00:02:56.970> want<00:02:57.209> a

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
for budget lipsticks and if you want a

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.300 
for budget lipsticks and if you want a
variant<00:02:57.780> that's<00:02:57.900> creamy<00:02:58.350> on<00:02:58.650> your<00:02:58.830> lips<00:02:59.040> and

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
variant that's creamy on your lips and

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.790 
variant that's creamy on your lips and
it<00:03:00.030> doesn't<00:03:00.450> dry<00:03:00.570> your<00:03:00.840> lips<00:03:00.959> out<00:03:01.200> these<00:03:01.530> are

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:01.800 
it doesn't dry your lips out these are

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:04.759
