00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:06.770
 I'm planning to have a town for guitar training today 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.470
 now 

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:13.740
 I think that rhythm is captured 

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:17.960
 This is the 3 rhythms I introduced last time 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.960
 It is a combination of rhythm and rhythm 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:24.690
 Let's go a little 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:29.670
 It is reading but it was first 

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:32.540
 In this regard Do you remember I was standing Tsu only 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.380
 There was only 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:37.390
 Again 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:40.579
 1 night surface and together Tattattatta 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:48.530
 You stood with 200 people 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:50.270
 Oh was only Tata' Tsu only from Tattattatta data Tatatatatatatatata hit Tatta' 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:55.700
 Tattatta 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:58.180
 When you copy any songs and this kind of rhythm becomes the Yeah right gradually read as 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:02.070
 But it will be very easy 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:04.310
 Well then let's try to get 1 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.310
 so 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:17.380
 It is really good to practice with actions 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:19.580
 3 notes that everyone can do today because I think some people do not listen to in Well 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:24.890
 5 frets of 3 strings 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:27.640
 Please look at the last time of the heat If you do not know where I was from Mashi last Meri 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:30.870
 This Nde I 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:32.280
 To match the rhythm 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:33.630
 2 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:38.009
 Four 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:42.420
 Somehow what what so Oh 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:47.290
 There was a turn 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:49.480
 I will do my best 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:50.890
 I because it is painful even out route voice 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:54.100
 Huh 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:55.260
 It said one would have a little match to rhythm 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.510
 When 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:01.290
 Went Tsu became only 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:06.240

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:14.540

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:19.220
 Ha was went 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:21.730
 If you can do it yourself 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:26.970
 But I think it would be better to raise 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:26.970
 Let's introduce Nezu b 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:35.670

 Even if you pull this, I pick it firmly with my right 

00:04:50.289 --> 00:05:00.300
 Alternate picking down up so this is something
