part in Dan's hand and obviously buddies

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.609 
part in Dan's hand and obviously buddies
and<00:02:02.700> has<00:02:02.850> one<00:02:03.119> power<00:02:03.299> you're<00:02:03.960> good<00:02:04.110> to<00:02:04.170> go

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.069 
and has one power you're good to go
and<00:02:04.799> then<00:02:05.670> after<00:02:06.060> it's<00:02:06.329> gonna<00:02:06.509> if<00:02:06.780> there<00:02:06.930> gets

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
and then after it's gonna if there gets

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:08.749 
and then after it's gonna if there gets
to<00:02:07.110> attack<00:02:07.259> you<00:02:08.039> can<00:02:08.190> do<00:02:08.250> whatever<00:02:08.399> you<00:02:08.580> want

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
to attack you can do whatever you want

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:09.630 
to attack you can do whatever you want
after<00:02:09.030> that

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
after that

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:11.400 
after that
but<00:02:10.179> it<00:02:10.270> looks<00:02:10.569> like<00:02:10.780> dant<00:02:11.050> might<00:02:11.140> be<00:02:11.230> able<00:02:11.350> to

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 
but it looks like dant might be able to

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:12.720 
but it looks like dant might be able to
get<00:02:11.500> that<00:02:11.590> third<00:02:11.800> card<00:02:12.040> out<00:02:12.160> of<00:02:12.190> his<00:02:12.310> hand<00:02:12.520> and

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
get that third card out of his hand and

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.559 
get that third card out of his hand and
he's<00:02:12.850> gonna<00:02:12.970> catch<00:02:13.180> transmitted<00:02:13.600> artifact

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
he's gonna catch transmitted artifact

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:18.240 
he's gonna catch transmitted artifact
it's<00:02:16.569> going<00:02:16.780> to<00:02:16.959> sacrifice<00:02:17.380> this<00:02:17.740> Hausman

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
it's going to sacrifice this Hausman

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.050 
it's going to sacrifice this Hausman
study<00:02:19.120> finds

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.900 

so<00:02:22.600> transmitted<00:02:23.080> artifact<00:02:23.470> is<00:02:23.650> a<00:02:23.790> kind<00:02:24.790> of<00:02:24.819> an

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
so transmitted artifact is a kind of an

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:27.900 
so transmitted artifact is a kind of an
odd<00:02:25.120> talk<00:02:25.540> from<00:02:25.930> antiquity<00:02:26.319> you<00:02:26.620> can<00:02:26.800> say<00:02:27.010> the

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 
odd talk from antiquity you can say the

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:30.120 
odd talk from antiquity you can say the
very<00:02:28.240> least<00:02:28.540> I<00:02:28.870> should<00:02:29.290> but<00:02:29.590> read<00:02:29.770> the<00:02:29.860> text

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 
very least I should but read the text

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:32.190 
very least I should but read the text
it's<00:02:30.280> basically<00:02:30.760> I<00:02:31.300> imagined<00:02:31.900> the<00:02:31.959> card

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
it's basically I imagined the card

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.949 
it's basically I imagined the card

that you go find accurate it's very

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:49.650 
that you go find accurate it's very
weird<00:02:47.590> that<00:02:47.890> this<00:02:48.040> car<00:02:48.280> would<00:02:48.459> came<00:02:49.000> first<00:02:49.390> and

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 
weird that this car would came first and

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:51.990 
weird that this car would came first and
then<00:02:49.989> ticker<00:02:50.680> came<00:02:50.980> second<00:02:51.520> cuz<00:02:51.640> it's<00:02:51.790> almost
