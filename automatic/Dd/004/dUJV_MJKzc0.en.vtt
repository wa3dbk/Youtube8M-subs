 and we keep stirring well 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.640
 until the liquid part is coupled with 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:44.610
 loneliness once we have our mojo 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:47.340
 done we will take a source and we will place 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:50.789

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.229
 today we have cut them to pieces for 

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:54.539
 the time to plate that we have left in 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:57.929
 shape of a lid a serving we put for 

00:01:54.539 --> 00:02:00.840
 on top of our marinade do not leave anna 

00:01:57.929 --> 00:02:04.439
 mortar and we will throw a little water 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:07.560
 to reduce what is the marinade we throw 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:10.170
 water until it covers everything 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.540
 We will put about 8 hours in the fridge 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:15.000
 rest so that what is the dogfish 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.480
 Soak the vinegar well with garlic and 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.480
 spices 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.600
 we should not wait for the 8 hours 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:29.210
 our drawer will rob us yesterday we 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.730
 we advance and prepare one uncover 

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:33.550
 our shark 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:36.849
 and what we will do is drain it a bit 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:39.069
 of our logo you will see that the dogfish 

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:42.010
 has changed a little bit of color is more 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:43.750
 white thanks to the vinegar that so that 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:46.599
 the vinegar is an acid that what we 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:48.129
 is to know the food this is a 

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:50.170
 dish that kids are very fond 

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:53.220
 because they are very sweet and with juices 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:56.150
 great let it drain well 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:59.210
 we will pass the marinade for flour 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:01.400
 we will place a frying pan and fry them 

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:04.680
 once the oil is hot 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:06.870
 we are always putting in mind to remember 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.540
 things from outside to inside that 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:10.740
 never splash on our roses 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:12.780
 we prepare a little dish with a little 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:15.270
 Absorbent paper to avoid excess 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:17.930
 of oil and we are going around 

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:17.930
 our drawer 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:22.720
 separation not by the two bands once 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.760
 we have our helmet made 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:27.660
 to get it out of the oil always dripping 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:30.660
 well and we put it in our paper 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:30.660
 absorbent 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:36.930
 once a couple of seconds has happened 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:39.410
 we passed our casual emplatar what the 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.410
 we will be placing 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:47.290
 we will record some chopsticks we will decorate with 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:49.930
 a leaf of parsley and to give it a 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:51.460
 little colorful to the plate we will put a 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:54.650
 bit 

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:57.799
 of sweet paprika 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:59.780
 and with this we would terminate our 

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:03.000
 tapita of today that would be a short 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:05.170
