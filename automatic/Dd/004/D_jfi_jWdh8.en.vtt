00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:14.190
 yes hello and welcome to 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:16.340
 a new video from software 124 today 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.380
 again in the name of mobile.de 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:22.050
 here today we have the e5 that is the 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.970
 big brothers of 4 each in we have you 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.700
 already presented some time ago and 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:29.790
 it is my favorite private battery and 

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:33.890
 now we have the big ones of the 15 

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:38.309
 1000 milliamps of the smaller 13,000 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:39.690
 costs four euros more and your partner 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.960
 Although off and I hire them 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.879
 a little bit ahead 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.989
 Here you see the five of you 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.589
 Packing forth in its full 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.629
 beauty 

00:00:46.589 --> 00:01:00.120
 we are packing now and 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:01:01.139
 then look what is it all about 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:06.320
 Packaging has become a bit 

00:01:01.139 --> 00:01:06.320
 changed to the precursors new charm 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:19.359
 the first time down then we have 

00:01:16.179 --> 00:01:22.119
 this box and here is everything 

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:27.359
 it's all up here too 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:29.109
 sure, a little folie will arrive 

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:34.509
 also have a look like it here 

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:37.060
 Inside, first choir looks out there 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:40.780
 Let's get right first 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:42.429
 to wake up and that's almost the same 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:43.569
 as with the predecessors 

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:45.549
 we have here again a little bit 

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:49.899
 instructions knickknack else is here 

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:52.569
 there is nothing left at the beginning of it 

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:53.709
 Nevertheless, the arag tour is a first 

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:55.030
 I also have a bit weird 

00:01:53.709 --> 00:01:58.590
 confused here are only two pieces then 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:03.250
 that she once got this 30 pin 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:05.469
 Plug for I believe 4 and 4s or four 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:09.280
 and underneath because they are not exactly for 

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:11.590
 these 30 police and samsung 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.299
 stronger it for the tablets and stuff 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.530
 further that one has so that he one 

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:16.690
 Little wondered because otherwise always 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:19.480
 Otherwise gm now the cable with the same 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.980
 a micro usb included the 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.079
 of course cool because we have now 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:25.900
 not somehow again an adapter here 

00:02:23.079 --> 00:02:27.880
 and this plug here one is lord 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.440
 Doctor but that's the same 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.630
 adapter in itself also with 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.609
 the cable is as usual from the 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:36.130
 Length equal to the same 

00:02:33.609 --> 00:02:39.040
 battery and keep hold so closely who this 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:40.510
 otherwise a small bag 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.780
 it also for the battery and now 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:46.930
 we come to the product itself 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:48.910
 That's just the battery is empty front 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:51.340
 Look exactly like his 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:54.310
 predecessors first come to the small 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:58.239
 We have four ads each 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:03:01.480
 Display ships 25 percent if we are 250 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:04.780
 when we have such will have 25.3 75 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:07.209
 and 400 quite logically in front two again 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:10.480
 outputs once 2 amps and 1 x 1 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:13.139
 amps and led in the middle which themselves 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:15.430
 can be switched on with a double-click 

00:03:13.139 --> 00:03:17.530
 nothing else is left behind 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:20.290
 a little bit the specification and what 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:21.879
 that is actually behind and on the 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:25.090
 We have nothing on the right side 

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:27.489
 left side is the loading port of this 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:30.640
 is loaded with this adapter there 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:33.189
 we simply plug the micro usb purely 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:36.760
 and the usb end comes in the 

00:03:33.189 --> 00:03:41.170
 computer or charger in what 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:42.629
 the outlet comes so we compare 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:45.849
 just short 

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:51.489
 I also have the 13,000 here and you 

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:54.310
 See the size is exactly the same 

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:56.700
 ever happening nothing is thick 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:58.599
 it's exactly the same thing just that he's 15,000 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:00.639
 apparently just a battery 

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:02.530
 has more in it and therefore more power 

00:04:00.639 --> 00:04:04.659
 has nothing in size 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:05.919
 by weight I think I have 

00:04:04.659 --> 00:04:07.569
 5 grams are that we are more 

00:04:05.919 --> 00:04:10.409
 can still be ten but not 

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:13.269
 really noticeable and still good 

00:04:10.409 --> 00:04:15.849
 yes, what should I say big about it 

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:17.229
 is actually the mp4 only with one 

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:18.130
 bigger battery the technology itself 

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:20.169
 is still the same 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:22.419
 and since I'm so incredibly happy with it 

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:24.669
 I am sure of my e4 

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:26.560
 even after a long-term test with the 45th 

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:28.389
 if you want to have more power take 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.860
 the 45 are you 13,000 again 

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:30.870
 take her fourth saves her 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:33.280
 another five euros 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:33.930
 and yes it was already with the 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:36.760
 Video 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:39.159
 you can of course do the article on it 

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:41.229
 find our website mobile.de 

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:43.120
 below we will get you and otherwise 

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:46.000
 link the rest as well as the product 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:48.720
 Amazon and so on and now 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.720
 only one more question 

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:56.970
 and
