00:01:03.669 --> 00:01:07.289
 I have a detention book. 

00:01:13.607 --> 00:01:15.840
 Hemoglobin. (Hemoglobin) 

00:01:19.784 --> 00:01:22.193

 Loud Haylark. 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:32.834
 Mattock. (Pickaxe) 

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:37.401
 Nancyboy, Potter. (Gay, Potter) 

00:01:42.121 --> 00:01:44.680
 Nibble. (nibble) 

00:01:54.242 --> 00:01:56.810
 Orifice. (Nozzle or opening) 

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:03.860
 Plectrum. 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.650
 Poinsettias.

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:23.490
 Under-manager. 

00:02:25.357 --> 00:02:28.080
 Zob. 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.360
 Absent. 

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:43.690
 Ok, your essays. 

00:02:44.165 --> 00:02:49.350
 Discuss the argument that Cleopatra has a body like a roller-blaster and the mind of a duck. 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.880
 Oxford and Cambridge are all over paper, 1976. 

00:03:04.134 --> 00:03:06.170
 Do not fidget Bland. 

00:03:07.664 --> 00:03:10.660
 The answer: Yes. 

00:03:13.144 --> 00:03:18.140
 Jones, M; Orifice; Sediment and Undermanager, we'll see each other after the lesson. 

00:03:20.017 --> 00:03:22.420
 Of course, most of you have not even written nearly enough ... 

00:03:21.363 --> 00:03:23.360
 Dint, your answer was unreadable. Put that away Plectrum. 

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:36.020
 If I see it again during this period, Plectrum, I'll have to pinch you. 

00:03:42.122 --> 00:03:44.680
 Do you have a lawyer, Plectrum? 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:55.000
 You're lying Plectrum, so I have to tweak you as well. 

00:03:55.822 --> 00:04:00.490
 I'll see you then later to be tweaked. Yes! Is not life tragic? 

00:04:04.553 --> 00:04:09.830
 Stop sulking boy, for God's sake. Has your housemother already seen these boils? 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:18.400
 Terrible, small hollow head. 

00:04:18.392 --> 00:04:22.110
 Bland, German, Nancyboy, Potter, Undermanager: Aufsetzkoppen. (Behavioral disorder in horses) 

00:04:22.385 --> 00:04:29.310
 Undermanager answered wrongly. Are you doing that on purpose, Undermanager? 

00:04:30.791 --> 00:04:33.950
 You're an idiot, undermanager, are not you? 

00:04:36.271 --> 00:04:39.110
 A boil on the butt of humanity. 

00:04:40.961 --> 00:04:43.080
 Do not giggle, Babcock! 

00:04:43.794 --> 00:04:45.890
 That is not so funny. 

00:04:46.163 --> 00:04:48.960
 Antony and Cleopatra is not a funny play. 

00:04:49.506 --> 00:04:53.810
 If Shakespeare had meant it funny, then he would have written a joke in it. 

00:05:00.163 --> 00:05:02.040
 There are no jokes in Antony and Cleopatra. 

00:05:03.067 --> 00:05:05.780
 Does anyone know of a play by Shakespeare by a joke? 

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:07.850
 Nibble? 

00:05:08.036 --> 00:05:09.040
 NIBBLE! 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.540
 LET ORIFICE IN REST! 

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:21.590
 What a bunch ... 

00:05:21.503 --> 00:05:24.140
 Okay, the rest of the time you will write about Eana Bobbis now. 

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:27.000
 Under-manager, try it and at least write "Eana Bobbis" ... 

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:33.070
 I do not really care ... 

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:39.820
 Usual conditions: do not confer, do not eat, no cheating, do not look out the window, do not talk, no slide rules. 

00:05:37.711 --> 00:05:40.710
 Use only ink, with a pen if possible. 

00:05:47.417 --> 00:05:51.040
 You can use circles, but not against you. 

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:55.150
 Kossigan ... 

00:05:54.847 --> 00:05:56.850
 ...you are responsible.
