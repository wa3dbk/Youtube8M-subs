pink<00:01:42.990> color<00:01:43.439> of<00:01:43.619> that<00:01:43.799> we<00:01:44.280> take<00:01:44.460> out<00:01:44.610> the<00:01:44.640> green

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
pink color of that we take out the green

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.200 
pink color of that we take out the green
and<00:01:45.689> we<00:01:45.840> put<00:01:46.020> in<00:01:46.140> purple<00:01:47.009> instead<00:01:47.250> we<00:01:48.030> get<00:01:48.180> a

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
and we put in purple instead we get a

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.179 
and we put in purple instead we get a
nice<00:01:48.329> color<00:01:48.630> there<00:01:48.899> and<00:01:49.140> you<00:01:49.710> can<00:01:49.890> kind<00:01:50.040> of<00:01:50.130> see

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
nice color there and you can kind of see

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.310 
nice color there and you can kind of see
what<00:01:50.700> I'm<00:01:50.820> on<00:01:51.000> about<00:01:51.030> we<00:01:51.570> can<00:01:51.750> mix<00:01:51.990> and<00:01:52.259> match

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
what I'm on about we can mix and match

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.590 
what I'm on about we can mix and match
different<00:01:52.950> dyes<00:01:53.549> to<00:01:53.909> make<00:01:54.030> different<00:01:54.420> color

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
different dyes to make different color

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.170 
different dyes to make different color
variations<00:01:54.720> and<00:01:55.710> another<00:01:56.549> cool<00:01:56.759> feature<00:01:56.790> is

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
variations and another cool feature is

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.300 
variations and another cool feature is
also<00:01:57.540> coming<00:01:57.899> into<00:01:58.140> u14<00:01:58.619> as<00:01:58.740> to<00:01:58.860> facts<00:01:59.070> we<00:01:59.219> were

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
also coming into u14 as to facts we were

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.819 
also coming into u14 as to facts we were
going<00:01:59.460> to<00:01:59.549> be<00:01:59.610> able<00:01:59.759> to<00:02:00.000> die<00:02:00.659> the<00:02:00.719> color<00:02:01.170> of<00:02:01.409> a

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
going to be able to die the color of a

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.410 
going to be able to die the color of a
dog<00:02:02.130> but<00:02:02.610> I<00:02:02.670> think<00:02:02.880> we're<00:02:03.030> only<00:02:03.149> going<00:02:03.270> to<00:02:03.360> be

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
dog but I think we're only going to be

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.300 
dog but I think we're only going to be
able<00:02:03.509> to<00:02:03.689> use<00:02:03.810> the<00:02:03.990> primary<00:02:04.560> diets<00:02:04.950> we<00:02:05.100> have

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
able to use the primary diets we have

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:06.679 
able to use the primary diets we have
here<00:02:05.579> we<00:02:05.700> won't<00:02:05.880> be<00:02:06.000> able<00:02:06.060> to<00:02:06.210> mix<00:02:06.390> and<00:02:06.540> match

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
here we won't be able to mix and match

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:09.139 
here we won't be able to mix and match
with<00:02:06.719> different<00:02:07.290> color<00:02:07.439> variations<00:02:07.530> and<00:02:08.340> like
