gigantic<00:00:39.930> cage<00:00:40.350> on<00:00:40.590> there<00:00:41.000> okay<00:00:42.000> I'm<00:00:42.059> trying

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
gigantic cage on there okay I'm trying

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:43.310 
gigantic cage on there okay I'm trying
to<00:00:42.510> jump<00:00:42.780> out

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
to jump out

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.010 
to jump out
so<00:00:43.950> it's<00:00:44.129> gigantic<00:00:44.850> and<00:00:45.360> this<00:00:45.510> is<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:45.780> cows

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
so it's gigantic and this is the cows

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.760 
so it's gigantic and this is the cows
then<00:00:46.530> since<00:00:47.370> they're<00:00:47.640> big<00:00:48.170> they're<00:00:49.170> not<00:00:49.230> even

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
then since they're big they're not even

00:00:49.770 --> 00:01:23.010 
then since they're big they're not even
a<00:00:49.829> jump<00:00:50.160> but<00:00:51.289> actually<00:00:52.289> there<00:00:53.039> you

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:23.020 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:25.660 

so<00:01:24.020> this<00:01:24.260> is<00:01:24.440> the<00:01:24.590> part<00:01:24.830> of<00:01:24.920> the<00:01:24.979> castle<00:01:25.490> I

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670
