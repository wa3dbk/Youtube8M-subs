00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
different standing technique I after

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.689 
different standing technique I after
getting<00:00:21.449> it<00:00:21.570> sanded<00:00:22.020> down<00:00:22.080> with<00:00:22.980> 1500<00:00:23.580> grit

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
getting it sanded down with 1500 grit

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.080 
getting it sanded down with 1500 grit
sandpaper<00:00:24.000> I<00:00:24.420> buffed<00:00:24.900> it<00:00:25.019> with<00:00:25.140> Tripoli<00:00:25.529> on

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:26.090 
sandpaper I buffed it with Tripoli on

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:29.419 
sandpaper I buffed it with Tripoli on
the<00:00:27.090> buffing<00:00:27.390> wheel<00:00:27.740> and<00:00:28.740> then<00:00:28.859> what<00:00:29.010> I<00:00:29.039> did<00:00:29.250> is

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
the buffing wheel and then what I did is

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:34.010 
the buffing wheel and then what I did is
I<00:00:29.640> put<00:00:30.390> a<00:00:30.420> black<00:00:30.689> stain<00:00:31.140> on<00:00:31.410> it<00:00:32.809> give<00:00:33.809> it<00:00:33.930> about

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:38.090 
three coats then I sanded it down with a

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:41.600 
three coats then I sanded it down with a
1500<00:00:39.090> grit<00:00:39.210> sandpaper<00:00:39.600> till<00:00:40.260> I<00:00:40.350> got<00:00:40.530> most<00:00:41.430> of

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
1500 grit sandpaper till I got most of

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.760 
1500 grit sandpaper till I got most of
the<00:00:41.670> black<00:00:41.879> off<00:00:42.120> but<00:00:42.390> it<00:00:42.780> left<00:00:43.020> the<00:00:43.170> black<00:00:43.440> in

the black off but it left the black in
the<00:00:44.550> softer<00:00:45.300> spots<00:00:46.110> at<00:00:46.320> the<00:00:46.350> breyer<00:00:46.620> grain<00:00:47.870> so

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
the softer spots at the breyer grain so

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.330 
the softer spots at the breyer grain so
then<00:00:49.079> once<00:00:49.289> I<00:00:49.379> had<00:00:49.559> it<00:00:49.590> sanded<00:00:50.129> down

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
then once I had it sanded down

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.689 
then once I had it sanded down
I'd<00:00:50.640> been<00:00:53.120> stained<00:00:54.120> it<00:00:54.360> with<00:00:54.390> I<00:00:54.600> diluted<00:00:55.379> the

00:00:55.689 --> 00:00:55.699 
I'd been stained it with I diluted the

00:00:55.699 --> 00:00:58.490 
I'd been stained it with I diluted the
fee<00:00:56.699> beings<00:00:57.030> I<00:00:57.510> believe<00:00:58.020> that's<00:00:58.199> how<00:00:58.289> you<00:00:58.350> say

brown and gave it Prabha

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.550 
brown and gave it Prabha
and<00:01:05.280> then<00:01:06.740> buffed<00:01:07.740> it<00:01:07.920> with<00:01:08.130> a<00:01:08.159> Tripoli

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:09.560 
and then buffed it with a Tripoli

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.730 
and then buffed it with a Tripoli
compound<00:01:11.600> get<00:01:12.600> it<00:01:12.720> really<00:01:12.960> smooth<00:01:13.290> then<00:01:13.560> went

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
compound get it really smooth then went

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.999 
compound get it really smooth then went
over<00:01:13.830> it<00:01:14.040> with<00:01:14.070> carnuba<00:01:14.490> wax<00:01:14.580> and<00:01:15.860> here's<00:01:16.860> my

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
over it with carnuba wax and here's my

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.730 
over it with carnuba wax and here's my
latest<00:01:17.220> pipe<00:01:18.140> there's<00:01:19.140> a<00:01:19.320> lot<00:01:19.619> of

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
latest pipe there's a lot of

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.830 
latest pipe there's a lot of
imperfections<00:01:19.950> on<00:01:20.460> this<00:01:20.670> and<00:01:20.880> each<00:01:21.270> time<00:01:21.630> I'm

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
imperfections on this and each time I'm

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:22.700 
imperfections on this and each time I'm
learning<00:01:22.140> so<00:01:22.290> much

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
learning so much

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.460 
learning so much
this<00:01:23.159> one<00:01:23.369> actually<00:01:23.840> kind<00:01:24.840> of<00:01:24.900> messed<00:01:25.080> up<00:01:25.290> on

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
this one actually kind of messed up on

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.370 
this one actually kind of messed up on
on<00:01:25.860> a<00:01:25.890> couple<00:01:26.280> little<00:01:26.400> spots<00:01:26.900> so<00:01:27.900> really<00:01:28.290> it

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
on a couple little spots so really it

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:29.929 
on a couple little spots so really it
turned<00:01:28.560> out<00:01:28.650> to<00:01:28.799> be<00:01:28.829> just<00:01:29.100> more<00:01:29.280> of<00:01:29.400> a<00:01:29.460> test<00:01:29.729> on

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
turned out to be just more of a test on

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.740 
turned out to be just more of a test on
learning<00:01:30.420> how<00:01:30.600> to<00:01:31.340> get<00:01:32.340> a<00:01:32.369> good<00:01:32.610> stain<00:01:33.119> to

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
learning how to get a good stain to

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.960 
learning how to get a good stain to
really<00:01:34.110> kind<00:01:34.290> of<00:01:34.350> highlight<00:01:34.740> and<00:01:35.009> make<00:01:35.280> the

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
really kind of highlight and make the

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.539 
really kind of highlight and make the
grain<00:01:36.420> pop<00:01:36.750> and<00:01:37.590> I<00:01:37.979> think<00:01:38.159> it<00:01:38.250> worked<00:01:38.369> pretty

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
grain pop and I think it worked pretty

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.219 
grain pop and I think it worked pretty
good<00:01:38.670> I<00:01:38.880> really<00:01:39.299> like<00:01:39.420> the<00:01:39.570> finish<00:01:39.720> on<00:01:40.020> this

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
good I really like the finish on this

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.749 
good I really like the finish on this
has<00:01:40.500> a<00:01:40.890> 7/8<00:01:41.520> inch<00:01:41.850> Bowl<00:01:42.570> and<00:01:43.490> then<00:01:44.490> I<00:01:44.520> put<00:01:44.729> a

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
has a 7/8 inch Bowl and then I put a

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.889 
has a 7/8 inch Bowl and then I put a
slight<00:01:45.119> bin<00:01:45.360> and<00:01:47.240> you<00:01:48.240> can<00:01:48.420> see<00:01:48.659> what<00:01:48.750> they're

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
slight bin and you can see what they're

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:55.130 
slight bin and you can see what they're
put<00:01:49.079> a<00:01:49.140> slight<00:01:49.320> Bend<00:01:49.590> on<00:01:49.740> it<00:01:52.520> but<00:01:53.520> yeah

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
put a slight Bend on it but yeah

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.900 
put a slight Bend on it but yeah
trying<00:01:55.800> to<00:01:55.890> get<00:01:56.010> to<00:01:56.100> the<00:01:56.190> point<00:01:56.340> so<00:01:56.550> one<00:01:56.730> day<00:01:56.850> I

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:56.910 
trying to get to the point so one day I

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:58.490 
trying to get to the point so one day I
can<00:01:56.940> maybe<00:01:57.330> sell<00:01:57.660> these<00:01:57.870> just<00:01:58.170> kind<00:01:58.290> of<00:01:58.380> with

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
can maybe sell these just kind of with

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.680 
can maybe sell these just kind of with
some<00:01:58.680> of<00:01:58.830> my<00:01:59.010> other<00:01:59.280> boxes<00:01:59.850> and<00:02:00.090> stuff<00:02:00.300> I<00:02:00.420> make

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:00.690

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.290 
so this was my latest experiment on
learning<00:02:06.720> how<00:02:06.960> to<00:02:06.990> stain<00:02:07.350> with<00:02:08.179> two<00:02:09.179> different

learning how to stain with two different
colors<00:02:09.690> your<00:02:09.869> first<00:02:10.110> initial<00:02:10.500> one<00:02:10.649> to<00:02:10.800> make

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
colors your first initial one to make

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.560 
colors your first initial one to make
the<00:02:11.039> grain<00:02:11.220> pop<00:02:11.430> then<00:02:11.730> your<00:02:11.910> secondary<00:02:12.300> one

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:12.570 
the grain pop then your secondary one

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:15.080 
the grain pop then your secondary one
for<00:02:12.840> kind<00:02:12.960> of<00:02:13.020> your<00:02:13.140> base<00:02:13.260> color<00:02:13.560> and<00:02:14.490> that's

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
for kind of your base color and that's

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.960 
for kind of your base color and that's
it<00:02:15.360> thanks<00:02:15.780> for<00:02:15.900> watching
