00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:19.390 
movement the same approach to every game
and<00:03:16.579> the<00:03:16.940> same<00:03:17.120> work<00:03:17.299> ethic<00:03:17.510> and<00:03:17.870> and<00:03:18.370> I'm<00:03:19.370> a

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.400 
and the same work ethic and and I'm a

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:20.860 
and the same work ethic and and I'm a
believer<00:03:19.700> that<00:03:19.880> the<00:03:20.060> harder<00:03:20.510> you<00:03:20.630> work<00:03:20.660> the

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:20.870 
believer that the harder you work the

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:23.710 
believer that the harder you work the
luckier<00:03:21.410> get<00:03:21.709> so<00:03:22.040> just<00:03:23.000> try<00:03:23.090> to<00:03:23.150> get<00:03:23.269> myself<00:03:23.450> in

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:23.720 
luckier get so just try to get myself in

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:24.909 
luckier get so just try to get myself in
the<00:03:23.810> positions<00:03:24.230> where<00:03:24.470> if<00:03:24.620> I<00:03:24.709> work<00:03:24.889> hard

00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:24.919 
the positions where if I work hard

00:03:24.919 --> 00:03:26.470 
the positions where if I work hard
enough<00:03:25.250> that<00:03:25.579> the<00:03:25.730> ball<00:03:25.910> will<00:03:26.060> drop<00:03:26.120> and

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:26.480 
enough that the ball will drop and

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.270 
enough that the ball will drop and
hopefully<00:03:27.200> if<00:03:27.260> I<00:03:27.349> make<00:03:27.500> good<00:03:27.650> contact<00:03:28.010> it<00:03:28.190> or

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.280 
hopefully if I make good contact it or

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.520 
hopefully if I make good contact it or
