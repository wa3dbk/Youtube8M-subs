guys my complex set of artillery cannons

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.340 
guys my complex set of artillery cannons
how<00:00:14.160> they<00:00:14.309> fired<00:00:14.549> how<00:00:14.790> they<00:00:14.940> work<00:00:15.230> this<00:00:16.230> took

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
how they fired how they work this took

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:17.810 
how they fired how they work this took
about<00:00:16.470> one<00:00:16.770> day<00:00:16.920> to<00:00:16.980> build<00:00:17.160> with<00:00:17.400> my<00:00:17.520> friends

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
about one day to build with my friends

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.570 
about one day to build with my friends
Nathan<00:00:18.180> and<00:00:18.510> Ryan<00:00:19.199> what<00:00:20.010> we<00:00:20.100> did<00:00:20.250> was<00:00:20.279> we<00:00:20.430> built

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
Nathan and Ryan what we did was we built

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.240 
Nathan and Ryan what we did was we built
this<00:00:20.850> one<00:00:21.029> as<00:00:21.180> the<00:00:21.330> kind<00:00:21.960> of<00:00:22.050> prototype<00:00:22.350> and<00:00:22.740> I

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
this one as the kind of prototype and I

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.310 
this one as the kind of prototype and I
added<00:00:23.519> some<00:00:23.580> decorations<00:00:24.150> to<00:00:24.330> it<00:00:24.480> and<00:00:24.600> then<00:00:25.230> we

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
added some decorations to it and then we

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.230 
added some decorations to it and then we
just<00:00:25.439> company<00:00:25.740> cut<00:00:26.340> copied<00:00:26.730> and<00:00:26.820> pasted<00:00:27.119> it

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
just company cut copied and pasted it

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.080 
just company cut copied and pasted it
over<00:00:27.599> so<00:00:28.109> we<00:00:28.230> just<00:00:28.380> kind<00:00:28.500> of<00:00:28.590> zoned<00:00:28.920> it

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:29.090 
over so we just kind of zoned it

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:35.540 
over so we just kind of zoned it
highlighted<00:00:30.090> it<00:00:30.470> faced<00:00:31.910> paced<00:00:33.290> and<00:00:34.340> we<00:00:35.340> worked

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
highlighted it faced paced and we worked

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.340 
highlighted it faced paced and we worked
it<00:00:35.640> that<00:00:35.790> way<00:00:35.960> they<00:00:36.960> are<00:00:37.200> all<00:00:37.620> staggered<00:00:38.190> I

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:39.350 
it that way they are all staggered I

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.770 
it that way they are all staggered I
believe<00:00:40.350> no<00:00:41.100> just<00:00:41.850> blossom<00:00:42.300> staggered<00:00:42.719> i

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
believe no just blossom staggered i

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:48.709 
believe no just blossom staggered i
guess<00:00:42.960> but<00:00:45.020> basically<00:00:46.020> they<00:00:46.230> will<00:00:46.770> shoot<00:00:47.719> all

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
guess but basically they will shoot all

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.860 
guess but basically they will shoot all
the<00:00:48.899> way<00:00:48.960> over<00:00:49.110> there<00:00:49.170> and<00:00:50.030> by<00:00:51.030> shoot<00:00:51.420> I<00:00:51.629> mean

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
the way over there and by shoot I mean

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.990 
the way over there and by shoot I mean
people<00:00:52.140> they<00:00:52.980> will<00:00:53.100> sort<00:00:53.340> ain<00:00:53.489> t<00:00:53.670> farther

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
people they will sort ain t farther

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.319 
people they will sort ain t farther
because<00:00:54.539> teenies<00:00:54.960> lighter<00:00:55.199> but<00:00:56.149> these<00:00:57.149> aren't

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
because teenies lighter but these aren't

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:58.610 
because teenies lighter but these aren't
for<00:00:57.420> shooting<00:00:57.690> gmt<00:00:57.989> there<00:00:58.199> for<00:00:58.379> shooting

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
for shooting gmt there for shooting

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:04.939 
for shooting gmt there for shooting
people<00:00:58.920> people<00:01:00.109> this<00:01:01.109> is<00:01:01.230> super<00:01:01.469> cool<00:01:03.949> no

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
people people this is super cool no

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.780 
people people this is super cool no
others<00:01:05.189> cake<00:01:05.430> they're<00:01:05.900> weird<00:01:07.310> okay<00:01:08.310> so

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
others cake they're weird okay so

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.630 
others cake they're weird okay so
basically<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:09.600> circuitry<00:01:09.930> for<00:01:10.020> these<00:01:10.490> if<00:01:11.490> you

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
basically the circuitry for these if you

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.490 
basically the circuitry for these if you
guys<00:01:11.760> want<00:01:11.939> to<00:01:12.000> see<00:01:12.119> is<00:01:12.330> oil<00:01:12.659> individual<00:01:13.320> and

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
guys want to see is oil individual and

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.770 
guys want to see is oil individual and
they<00:01:13.650> all<00:01:13.740> connect<00:01:14.040> underground<00:01:14.689> under<00:01:15.689> the

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
they all connect underground under the

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.330 
they all connect underground under the
boom<00:01:15.930> over<00:01:16.170> to<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:16.560> control<00:01:16.830> tower<00:01:16.979> which<00:01:17.189> has

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
boom over to the control tower which has

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.469 
boom over to the control tower which has
an<00:01:17.460> all-inclusive<00:01:17.729> button<00:01:18.119> that<00:01:18.210> you<00:01:18.240> push

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
an all-inclusive button that you push

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.749 
an all-inclusive button that you push
that<00:01:18.840> will<00:01:19.049> launch<00:01:19.290> you<00:01:19.500> they<00:01:20.400> all<00:01:20.460> have<00:01:20.640> to<00:01:20.670> be

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
that will launch you they all have to be

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.840 
that will launch you they all have to be
separate<00:01:21.270> circuit<00:01:21.689> or<00:01:22.460> mr.<00:01:23.460> Chi<00:01:23.580> all<00:01:23.700> has<00:01:23.820> to

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
separate circuit or mr. Chi all has to

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.249 
separate circuit or mr. Chi all has to
be<00:01:23.970> separate<00:01:24.299> because<00:01:24.450> if<00:01:24.780> we<00:01:24.930> don't<00:01:25.020> do<00:01:25.229> it

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
be separate because if we don't do it

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.670 
be separate because if we don't do it
that<00:01:25.380> way<00:01:25.650> then<00:01:25.680> the<00:01:25.920> redstone<00:01:26.280> won't<00:01:27.680> connect

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
that way then the redstone won't connect

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.969 
that way then the redstone won't connect
to<00:01:29.119> all<00:01:30.119> the<00:01:30.270> parts<00:01:30.570> back<00:01:31.500> here<00:01:31.710> we<00:01:31.829> have<00:01:31.950> a

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
to all the parts back here we have a

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.190 
to all the parts back here we have a
fake<00:01:32.220> amer<00:01:32.430> room<00:01:32.700> to<00:01:33.180> distract<00:01:34.110> people

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
fake amer room to distract people

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.289 
fake amer room to distract people
everybody<00:01:35.130> thinks<00:01:35.340> there's<00:01:35.460> a<00:01:35.549> Mon<00:01:35.729> man<00:01:35.939> can't
