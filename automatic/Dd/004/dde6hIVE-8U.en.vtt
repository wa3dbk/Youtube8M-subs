on<00:02:58.710> a<00:02:58.770> zero<00:02:59.400> so<00:03:00.090> that<00:03:00.120> means<00:03:00.630> it<00:03:00.990> they<00:03:01.560> don't

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
on a zero so that means it they don't

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:06.950 
on a zero so that means it they don't
not<00:03:02.550> come<00:03:02.910> on<00:03:03.120> they<00:03:03.690> don't<00:03:03.930> spawn<00:03:05.660> now<00:03:06.660> I'll

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:06.960 
not come on they don't spawn now I'll

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:10.880 
not come on they don't spawn now I'll
share<00:03:07.920> I<00:03:08.430> don't<00:03:09.120> know<00:03:09.210> what's<00:03:09.390> a<00:03:09.540> limit<00:03:09.930> it

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
share I don't know what's a limit it

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.430 
share I don't know what's a limit it
means<00:03:11.160> they<00:03:11.460> don't<00:03:11.790> spawn<00:03:12.330> them<00:03:12.690> because

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
means they don't spawn them because

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:18.890 
means they don't spawn them because
there<00:03:13.710> are<00:03:13.920> several<00:03:16.640> copper<00:03:17.640> and<00:03:17.850> tin<00:03:18.060> from

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
there are several copper and tin from

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.920 
there are several copper and tin from
thermal<00:03:19.410> expansion<00:03:20.130> and<00:03:20.310> red<00:03:20.700> power<00:03:20.940> and<00:03:21.600> we

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
thermal expansion and red power and we

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:23.750 
thermal expansion and red power and we
want<00:03:22.170> to<00:03:22.320> wrap<00:03:22.530> our<00:03:22.709> one<00:03:22.950> because<00:03:23.340> that's<00:03:23.550> the

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
want to wrap our one because that's the

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.230 
want to wrap our one because that's the
default<00:03:24.560> like<00:03:25.560> take<00:03:26.040> it<00:03:26.070> you<00:03:26.430> know<00:03:26.610> that<00:03:26.850> we

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:27.240 
default like take it you know that we

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:29.150 
default like take it you know that we
always<00:03:27.390> find<00:03:27.780> a<00:03:27.930> lot<00:03:28.080> of<00:03:28.110> tin<00:03:28.440> and<00:03:28.470> copper<00:03:28.680> and

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
always find a lot of tin and copper and

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:33.699 
always find a lot of tin and copper and
you<00:03:29.310> do<00:03:29.490> want<00:03:29.790> to<00:03:30.000> back<00:03:30.410> so<00:03:32.000> you<00:03:33.000> want<00:03:33.209> to<00:03:33.330> go

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:33.709 
you do want to back so you want to go

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:39.199 
you do want to back so you want to go
click<00:03:34.709> on<00:03:35.390> copper<00:03:36.709> go<00:03:37.709> to<00:03:37.770> convert<00:03:38.640> the<00:03:38.850> silver

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:39.209 
click on copper go to convert the silver

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:45.350 
click on copper go to convert the silver
tin<00:03:39.480> and<00:03:39.840> change<00:03:40.230> into<00:03:40.440> one<00:03:41.030> don't<00:03:44.090> be<00:03:45.090> sure

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:45.360 
tin and change into one don't be sure

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.150 
tin and change into one don't be sure
you<00:03:45.570> don't<00:03:45.810> change<00:03:46.050> anything<00:03:46.440> else<00:03:46.860> because

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
you don't change anything else because

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.120 
you don't change anything else because
it<00:03:47.489> can<00:03:47.700> cause<00:03:47.940> problems<00:03:48.590> okay<00:03:49.590> so<00:03:49.650> when<00:03:50.010> you

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:50.130 
it can cause problems okay so when you

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:53.210 
it can cause problems okay so when you
have<00:03:50.340> that<00:03:50.550> want<00:03:51.030> to<00:03:51.180> save<00:03:51.450> it<00:03:51.860> they<00:03:52.860> already

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
have that want to save it they already

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:57.920 
have that want to save it they already
dead<00:03:53.550> so<00:03:55.040> close<00:03:56.040> that<00:03:56.420> now<00:03:57.420> we're<00:03:57.630> going<00:03:57.810> to

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
dead so close that now we're going to

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:00.500 
dead so close that now we're going to
search<00:03:58.260> for<00:03:58.440> thermal<00:03:58.830> expansion<00:03:59.580> maybe<00:04:00.300> it's

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
search for thermal expansion maybe it's

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:03.620 
search for thermal expansion maybe it's
hard<00:04:00.720> to<00:04:00.900> find<00:04:01.200> because<00:04:01.440> it's<00:04:01.680> hilly<00:04:02.400> many<00:04:03.150> so

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:03.630 
hard to find because it's hilly many so

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:08.350 
hard to find because it's hilly many so
you<00:04:03.900> just<00:04:04.200> press<00:04:04.560> ctrl<00:04:05.160> f<00:04:05.480> and<00:04:06.480> deep<00:04:07.380> thermal

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:08.360 
you just press ctrl f and deep thermal

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:14.630 
you just press ctrl f and deep thermal
expansions<00:04:09.360> there<00:04:10.320> we<00:04:10.590> go<00:04:11.550> yes<00:04:12.150> GF<00:04:12.840> g<00:04:13.580> ok<00:04:14.580> so

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:14.640 
expansions there we go yes GF g ok so

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:18.199 
expansions there we go yes GF g ok so
now<00:04:14.910> when<00:04:15.120> i<00:04:15.150> go<00:04:15.239> scroll<00:04:16.020> down<00:04:16.580> and<00:04:17.580> see<00:04:17.970> where

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 
now when i go scroll down and see where

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:22.870 
now when i go scroll down and see where
is<00:04:18.419> it<00:04:18.570> so<00:04:19.500> we're<00:04:19.739> going<00:04:19.919> to<00:04:20.070> world<00:04:20.340> again<00:04:20.669> and

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:22.880 
is it so we're going to world again and

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:26.810 
is it so we're going to world again and
you<00:04:23.880> see<00:04:24.180> you<00:04:24.479> it<00:04:24.750> says<00:04:25.110> here<00:04:25.410> a<00:04:25.800> copper<00:04:26.310> to

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:26.820 
you see you it says here a copper to

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:30.800 
you see you it says here a copper to
silver<00:04:27.810> and<00:04:27.960> didn't<00:04:28.290> true<00:04:28.680> but<00:04:29.670> I<00:04:29.910> have<00:04:30.300> put<00:04:30.630> it

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:30.810 
silver and didn't true but I have put it

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:34.340 
silver and didn't true but I have put it
or<00:04:30.990> false<00:04:31.440> so<00:04:31.920> it<00:04:32.130> won't<00:04:32.400> spawn<00:04:32.910> you<00:04:33.720> can<00:04:34.050> put

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:34.350 
or false so it won't spawn you can put

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:39.530 
or false so it won't spawn you can put
it<00:04:34.500> on<00:04:35.310> but<00:04:35.730> the<00:04:36.000> thing<00:04:36.240> is<00:04:36.320> it<00:04:37.320> will<00:04:37.680> you<00:04:38.540> have

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:39.540 
it on but the thing is it will you have

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:42.290 
it on but the thing is it will you have
to<00:04:39.690> demo<00:04:39.930> oars<00:04:40.260> and<00:04:40.620> it's<00:04:41.160> not<00:04:41.430> that<00:04:41.460> method<00:04:42.090> in

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:42.300 
to demo oars and it's not that method in

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:45.020 
to demo oars and it's not that method in
this<00:04:42.540> 20<00:04:42.810> p<00:04:43.170> you<00:04:43.320> now<00:04:43.530> you<00:04:43.950> have<00:04:44.100> everywhere

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:45.030 
this 20 p you now you have everywhere

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:49.340 
this 20 p you now you have everywhere
then<00:04:45.840> L<00:04:46.050> copper<00:04:46.640> allow<00:04:47.640> a<00:04:47.960> little<00:04:48.960> bit<00:04:49.110> more

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:49.350 
then L copper allow a little bit more

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:52.040 
then L copper allow a little bit more
but<00:04:49.650> it's<00:04:49.860> OPN<00:04:50.550> you<00:04:50.760> maybe<00:04:51.420> don't<00:04:51.600> want<00:04:51.900> it

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:52.050 
but it's OPN you maybe don't want it

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:55.010 
but it's OPN you maybe don't want it
feel<00:04:52.260> free<00:04:52.440> to<00:04:52.680> do<00:04:52.830> it<00:04:53.060> but<00:04:54.060> I<00:04:54.240> just<00:04:54.300> going<00:04:54.900> to

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:57.840 
do it this way so put these three and

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:00.830 
do it this way so put these three and
fast<00:04:58.140> don't<00:04:59.010> do<00:04:59.220> anything<00:04:59.580> about<00:05:00.030> pharaohs

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:00.840 
fast don't do anything about pharaohs

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:07.100 
fast don't do anything about pharaohs
and<00:05:01.370> fellows<00:05:02.370> and<00:05:02.670> lead<00:05:03.830> or<00:05:05.360> vanilla<00:05:06.360> auckland

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:07.110 
and fellows and lead or vanilla auckland

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:10.970 
and fellows and lead or vanilla auckland
just<00:05:07.380> put<00:05:07.860> it<00:05:08.010> off<00:05:08.190> false<00:05:08.940> or<00:05:09.690> and<00:05:10.590> through

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:10.980 
just put it off false or and through

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:14.480 
just put it off false or and through
because<00:05:11.450> that's<00:05:12.450> the<00:05:12.750> old<00:05:12.990> models<00:05:13.500> fancy<00:05:14.160> so

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:14.490 
because that's the old models fancy so

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:19.730 
because that's the old models fancy so
yeah<00:05:15.710> so<00:05:16.710> if<00:05:16.950> you<00:05:17.130> put<00:05:17.460> on<00:05:17.820> false<00:05:18.360> if<00:05:19.230> you<00:05:19.530> like

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:19.740 
yeah so if you put on false if you like

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:23.860 
yeah so if you put on false if you like
to<00:05:19.980> click<00:05:20.760> on<00:05:20.910> save<00:05:21.150> again<00:05:21.540> and<00:05:22.190> now<00:05:23.190> go<00:05:23.460> to<00:05:23.520> you

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:23.870 
to click on save again and now go to you

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:27.890 
to click on save again and now go to you
test<00:05:24.870> world<00:05:25.310> one<00:05:26.310> thing<00:05:26.520> I<00:05:26.670> recommend<00:05:26.880> is<00:05:27.390> a

test world one thing I recommend is a

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:30.800 
test world one thing I recommend is a
new<00:05:28.140> world<00:05:28.440> or<00:05:28.770> you<00:05:29.580> can<00:05:29.760> also<00:05:30.000> do<00:05:30.180> it<00:05:30.210> on<00:05:30.480> your

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:30.810 
new world or you can also do it on your

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:35.060 
new world or you can also do it on your
own<00:05:31.050> world<00:05:31.800> but<00:05:32.690> you<00:05:33.690> have<00:05:33.900> to<00:05:34.080> get<00:05:34.350> new<00:05:34.680> chance

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:35.070 
own world but you have to get new chance

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:38.630
