this past week and let's get started so

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.630 
this past week and let's get started so
today<00:00:31.470> we'll<00:00:31.679> be<00:00:31.859> looking<00:00:32.099> at<00:00:32.430> doing

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
today we'll be looking at doing

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.889 
today we'll be looking at doing
arithmetic<00:00:33.210> in<00:00:33.719> Java<00:00:34.110> and<00:00:34.469> this<00:00:35.130> is<00:00:35.250> basically

00:00:35.889 --> 00:00:35.899 
arithmetic in Java and this is basically

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:39.709 
arithmetic in Java and this is basically
plus<00:00:36.899> you<00:00:37.590> know<00:00:37.739> -<00:00:38.399> you<00:00:38.670> know<00:00:38.730> multiplication

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
plus you know - you know multiplication

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.690 
plus you know - you know multiplication
division<00:00:40.170> modulus<00:00:41.010> incrementation

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
division modulus incrementation

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.700 
division modulus incrementation
documentation<00:00:42.629> we'll<00:00:42.960> be<00:00:43.110> taking<00:00:43.410> a<00:00:43.469> look<00:00:43.620> at

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
documentation we'll be taking a look at

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.220 
documentation we'll be taking a look at
all<00:00:43.950> that<00:00:44.160> in<00:00:44.430> java<00:00:44.789> today<00:00:45.270> so<00:00:45.960> let's<00:00:46.110> get

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
all that in java today so let's get

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.090 
all that in java today so let's get
started<00:00:46.559> by<00:00:46.770> first<00:00:47.480> putting<00:00:48.480> all<00:00:48.780> our<00:00:49.100> classes

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
started by first putting all our classes

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.060 
started by first putting all our classes
here<00:00:50.579> methods<00:00:51.059> here<00:00:51.300> and<00:00:51.770> what<00:00:52.770> let's<00:00:52.949> get

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
here methods here and what let's get

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.090 
here methods here and what let's get
start<00:00:53.309> so<00:00:53.789> um<00:00:54.149> let's<00:00:54.660> first<00:00:55.020> make<00:00:55.320> a<00:00:55.590> string

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
start so um let's first make a string

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.680 
start so um let's first make a string
variable<00:00:56.940> and<00:00:57.750> let's<00:00:57.989> call<00:00:58.170> it<00:00:58.260> message<00:00:58.649> and

00:00:59.680 --> 00:00:59.690 
variable and let's call it message and

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:04.539 
variable and let's call it message and
call<00:01:00.690> it<00:01:00.840> hello<00:01:01.670> okay<00:01:02.699> and<00:01:02.910> make<00:01:03.899> another<00:01:04.199> one

00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:04.549 
call it hello okay and make another one

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:10.490 
call it hello okay and make another one
and<00:01:06.770> call<00:01:07.770> it<00:01:07.950> message<00:01:08.670> -<00:01:09.119> and<00:01:09.570> equal<00:01:09.990> this<00:01:10.140> -

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
and call it message - and equal this -

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.100 
and call it message - and equal this -
world<00:01:11.220> and<00:01:12.030> make<00:01:12.210> sure<00:01:12.330> to<00:01:12.450> put<00:01:12.479> a<00:01:12.630> space<00:01:12.869> here

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
world and make sure to put a space here

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.570 
world and make sure to put a space here
so<00:01:13.140> it<00:01:13.409> looks<00:01:13.590> like<00:01:13.770> a<00:01:13.799> sentence<00:01:14.250> because

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
so it looks like a sentence because

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.719 
so it looks like a sentence because
we're<00:01:14.760> gonna<00:01:14.850> be<00:01:15.600> adding<00:01:15.810> it<00:01:16.140> together<00:01:16.729> okay

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
we're gonna be adding it together okay

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:24.260 
we're gonna be adding it together okay
so<00:01:18.409> now<00:01:19.409> let's<00:01:20.070> add<00:01:20.280> them<00:01:20.670> together<00:01:23.090> put<00:01:24.090> the

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
so now let's add them together put the

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.570 
so now let's add them together put the
the<00:01:24.689> you<00:01:25.560> know<00:01:25.590> the<00:01:25.860> system<00:01:26.220> dot<00:01:26.369> out<00:01:26.520> dot

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
the you know the system dot out dot

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.440 
the you know the system dot out dot
print<00:01:27.030> same<00:01:27.600> it<00:01:27.780> and<00:01:27.979> let's<00:01:28.979> do<00:01:29.189> message<00:01:30.180> I'm

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
print same it and let's do message I'm

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.510 
print same it and let's do message I'm
sorry<00:01:30.689> no<00:01:30.930> quotes<00:01:31.320> remember<00:01:31.829> four<00:01:32.040> variables

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
sorry no quotes remember four variables

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.450 
sorry no quotes remember four variables

hello<00:01:45.479> world<00:01:46.009> that<00:01:47.009> was<00:01:47.100> pretty<00:01:47.310> simple<00:01:47.610> we

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
hello world that was pretty simple we

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.749 
hello world that was pretty simple we
touched<00:01:48.810> on<00:01:48.960> this<00:01:49.079> before<00:01:49.310> if<00:01:50.310> you<00:01:50.430> watch<00:01:50.579> my

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
touched on this before if you watch my

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:54.649 
touched on this before if you watch my
previous<00:01:50.790> tutorials<00:01:52.759> now<00:01:53.759> let's<00:01:54.030> do<00:01:54.210> Maya

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
previous tutorials now let's do Maya

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.109 
previous tutorials now let's do Maya
sing<00:01:55.079> so<00:01:55.649> for<00:01:55.860> this<00:01:55.920> we<00:01:56.130> need<00:01:56.159> numbers

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
sing so for this we need numbers

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.440 
sing so for this we need numbers
obviously<00:01:57.869> we're<00:01:58.590> gonna<00:01:58.680> create<00:01:58.979> an<00:01:59.100> integer

00:01:59.440 --> 00:01:59.450 
obviously we're gonna create an integer

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.700 
obviously we're gonna create an integer
call<00:02:00.450> it<00:02:00.570> num<00:02:00.869> and<00:02:01.590> eagle<00:02:01.950> this<00:02:02.130> to<00:02:02.490> ten<00:02:03.479> and

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:03.710 
call it num and eagle this to ten and

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:07.700 
call it num and eagle this to ten and
then<00:02:04.710> make<00:02:04.920> another<00:02:05.040> one<00:02:05.460> I<00:02:05.640> love<00:02:06.090> to<00:02:06.710> equal

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
then make another one I love to equal

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.490 
then make another one I love to equal
this<00:02:07.829> to<00:02:08.160> five<00:02:08.520> and<00:02:09.300> now<00:02:09.780> let's<00:02:10.020> just<00:02:10.289> do

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
this to five and now let's just do

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.610 
this to five and now let's just do
system<00:02:10.979> dot<00:02:11.310> out<00:02:11.550> dot<00:02:11.610> println

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
system dot out dot println

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:20.450 
system dot out dot println
and<00:02:13.980> do<00:02:14.220> number<00:02:14.820> -<00:02:15.810> number<00:02:17.990> -<00:02:19.070> and<00:02:20.070> if<00:02:20.310> I'm

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:20.460 
and do number - number - and if I'm

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:21.890 
and do number - number - and if I'm
going<00:02:20.670> a<00:02:20.760> little<00:02:20.790> too<00:02:21.000> fast<00:02:21.330> here<00:02:21.630> you<00:02:21.780> can

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
here and it will do 10 minus 5 press

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.030 
here and it will do 10 minus 5 press
play<00:02:38.310> and<00:02:38.850> as<00:02:39.000> you<00:02:39.090> can<00:02:39.210> see<00:02:39.270> five<00:02:39.840> so<00:02:40.650> that's

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
play and as you can see five so that's

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.580 
play and as you can see five so that's
10<00:02:41.280> minutes<00:02:41.430> 5<00:02:41.640> obviously<00:02:42.210> now<00:02:42.900> let's<00:02:43.170> look<00:02:43.380> at

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
10 minutes 5 obviously now let's look at

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.650 
10 minutes 5 obviously now let's look at
multiplication<00:02:44.060> we're<00:02:45.060> gonna<00:02:45.150> be<00:02:45.270> using<00:02:45.570> the

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
multiplication we're gonna be using the

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:49.570 
multiplication we're gonna be using the
same<00:02:46.280> integers<00:02:47.280> variables<00:02:47.550> whatever<00:02:48.530> and

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:49.580 
same integers variables whatever and

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:52.210 
same integers variables whatever and
we're<00:02:50.580> gonna<00:02:50.700> put<00:02:50.940> system<00:02:51.630> dot<00:02:51.930> out<00:02:52.140> dot

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
we're gonna put system dot out dot

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:59.690 
we're gonna put system dot out dot
println<00:02:53.570> num1<00:02:56.210> by<00:02:57.210> num2<00:02:58.280> put<00:02:59.280> a<00:02:59.310> semicolon

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
println num1 by num2 put a semicolon

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.680 
println num1 by num2 put a semicolon
here<00:02:59.940> so<00:03:00.750> we<00:03:00.900> press<00:03:01.050> play<00:03:01.320> and<00:03:01.620> as<00:03:02.220> you<00:03:02.310> can<00:03:02.400> see

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690 
here so we press play and as you can see

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:07.660 
here so we press play and as you can see
50s<00:03:03.690> here<00:03:03.980> and<00:03:04.980> that's<00:03:05.160> just<00:03:05.520> 10<00:03:06.480> times<00:03:06.810> 50

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:07.670 
50s here and that's just 10 times 50

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:11.000 
50s here and that's just 10 times 50
basic<00:03:08.670> basic<00:03:09.090> math<00:03:09.270> it's<00:03:09.810> easy<00:03:09.960> and<00:03:10.380> now<00:03:10.740> let's

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
basic basic math it's easy and now let's

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:14.990 
basic basic math it's easy and now let's
do<00:03:11.250> division<00:03:12.620> system<00:03:13.620> dot<00:03:13.860> out<00:03:14.070> dot<00:03:14.130> println

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
do division system dot out dot println

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.060 
do division system dot out dot println
and<00:03:15.720> dual<00:03:16.320> um<00:03:16.670> divided<00:03:17.670> by<00:03:18.020> num2

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.070 
and dual um divided by num2

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:23.690 
and dual um divided by num2
okay<00:03:21.000> first<00:03:21.870> play<00:03:22.080> save<00:03:22.650> press<00:03:22.980> play<00:03:23.160> and<00:03:23.340> as

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
okay first play save press play and as

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.090 
okay first play save press play and as
you<00:03:23.760> can<00:03:23.850> see<00:03:23.910> to<00:03:24.450> right<00:03:24.750> here<00:03:24.990> 10<00:03:25.620> divided<00:03:25.980> by

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
you can see to right here 10 divided by

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:30.230 
you can see to right here 10 divided by
5<00:03:26.490> is<00:03:26.820> 2<00:03:27.140> so<00:03:28.140> on<00:03:28.500> now<00:03:29.040> let's<00:03:29.670> look<00:03:29.940> at<00:03:30.120> the

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:30.240 
5 is 2 so on now let's look at the

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:32.870 
5 is 2 so on now let's look at the
modulus<00:03:30.780> and<00:03:31.020> many<00:03:31.890> of<00:03:32.010> you<00:03:32.130> probably<00:03:32.400> haven't

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
modulus and many of you probably haven't

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.000 
modulus and many of you probably haven't
heard<00:03:33.000> of<00:03:33.300> this<00:03:33.420> this<00:03:34.230> is<00:03:34.380> basically<00:03:34.710> the

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
heard of this this is basically the

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.100 
heard of this this is basically the
remainder<00:03:35.580> of<00:03:35.700> a<00:03:35.790> division<00:03:36.090> operation<00:03:36.330> so<00:03:36.990> if

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:37.110 
remainder of a division operation so if

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:39.710 
remainder of a division operation so if
I<00:03:37.200> were<00:03:37.350> to<00:03:37.500> do<00:03:37.620> 11<00:03:38.130> divided<00:03:38.640> by<00:03:38.670> 5<00:03:39.030> that<00:03:39.600> will

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
I were to do 11 divided by 5 that will

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:43.840 
I were to do 11 divided by 5 that will
be<00:03:39.900> remainder<00:03:40.350> 1<00:03:40.650> so<00:03:41.460> let's<00:03:42.450> actually<00:03:42.630> do<00:03:42.900> that

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:43.850 
be remainder 1 so let's actually do that

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:46.660 
be remainder 1 so let's actually do that
num-num<00:03:44.850> create<00:03:45.510> two<00:03:45.690> new<00:03:45.840> variables<00:03:46.050> and

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:46.670 
num-num create two new variables and

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:53.390 
num-num create two new variables and
let's<00:03:47.670> do<00:03:47.790> 11<00:03:48.240> and<00:03:49.040> int<00:03:50.040> 1<00:03:50.550> 2<00:03:50.900> equal<00:03:51.900> to<00:03:52.040> 5

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
let's do 11 and int 1 2 equal to 5

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:57.290 
let's do 11 and int 1 2 equal to 5
okay<00:03:54.150> so<00:03:54.209> let's<00:03:55.080> just<00:03:55.410> print<00:03:56.220> this<00:03:56.520> out<00:03:56.880> and

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:57.300 
okay so let's just print this out and

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:01.340 
okay so let's just print this out and
the<00:03:57.600> modulus<00:03:57.990> sign<00:03:58.230> is<00:03:58.470> a<00:03:58.500> %<00:03:59.250> and<00:03:59.990> so<00:04:00.990> we<00:04:01.140> just

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:01.350 
the modulus sign is a % and so we just

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:08.030 
the modulus sign is a % and so we just
do<00:04:01.500> person<00:04:02.070> um<00:04:02.660> %<00:04:03.860> num2<00:04:05.810> okay<00:04:06.810> so<00:04:07.320> that<00:04:07.920> will

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
do person um % num2 okay so that will

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.550 
do person um % num2 okay so that will
give<00:04:08.130> us<00:04:08.160> one<00:04:08.480> press<00:04:09.480> play<00:04:09.750> as<00:04:09.959> you<00:04:10.200> can<00:04:10.320> see

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
give us one press play as you can see

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:13.850 
give us one press play as you can see
one<00:04:11.300> so<00:04:12.300> that's<00:04:12.420> good<00:04:12.630> and<00:04:12.810> now<00:04:13.230> we<00:04:13.290> can<00:04:13.620> look

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:13.860 
one so that's good and now we can look

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:17.270 
one so that's good and now we can look
at<00:04:14.010> the<00:04:15.170> implementation<00:04:16.170> and<00:04:16.709> documentation

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
at the implementation and documentation

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.729 
at the implementation and documentation
operators<00:04:18.000> and<00:04:18.600> incrementation<00:04:19.260> and

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 
operators and incrementation and

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:21.380 
operators and incrementation and
documentation<00:04:20.459> is<00:04:20.640> basically<00:04:21.180> it's<00:04:21.330> just

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:21.390 
documentation is basically it's just

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:24.080 
documentation is basically it's just
adding<00:04:21.720> by<00:04:22.320> one<00:04:22.560> or<00:04:22.830> decreasing<00:04:23.490> by<00:04:23.610> one<00:04:23.850> and

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.090 
adding by one or decreasing by one and

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:26.340 
adding by one or decreasing by one and
they're<00:04:24.450> represented<00:04:25.020> by<00:04:25.140> these<00:04:25.500> plus

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:26.350 
they're represented by these plus

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:30.270 
they're represented by these plus
symbols<00:04:26.740> and<00:04:27.060> minus<00:04:28.060> two<00:04:28.330> minus<00:04:28.990> symbols<00:04:29.530> so

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:30.280 
symbols and minus two minus symbols so

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:36.410 
symbols and minus two minus symbols so
let's<00:04:30.760> do<00:04:30.940> system<00:04:31.360> dot<00:04:31.660> out<00:04:31.930> dot<00:04:32.850> println<00:04:34.110> and

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:36.420 
let's do system dot out dot println and

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:40.320 
let's do system dot out dot println and
plus<00:04:37.420> +<00:04:37.690> num<00:04:38.670> you<00:04:39.670> always<00:04:39.880> have<00:04:40.000> to<00:04:40.090> put<00:04:40.240> it

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:40.330 
plus + num you always have to put it

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:43.980 
plus + num you always have to put it
before<00:04:40.480> the<00:04:41.100> variable<00:04:42.100> press<00:04:43.060> play<00:04:43.390> as<00:04:43.600> you

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:43.990 
before the variable press play as you

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:47.460 
before the variable press play as you
can<00:04:44.050> see<00:04:44.290> 12<00:04:44.740> because<00:04:45.130> 11<00:04:45.430> plus<00:04:45.820> 1<00:04:46.120> equals<00:04:47.020> 12

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:47.470 
can see 12 because 11 plus 1 equals 12

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:49.590 
can see 12 because 11 plus 1 equals 12
and<00:04:47.740> just<00:04:48.490> because<00:04:48.730> I'm<00:04:48.850> lazy<00:04:49.060> I'm<00:04:49.300> just<00:04:49.480> gonna

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:49.600 
and just because I'm lazy I'm just gonna

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:53.220 
and just because I'm lazy I'm just gonna
copy<00:04:49.960> and<00:04:50.320> paste<00:04:50.820> this<00:04:51.820> down<00:04:52.120> below<00:04:52.480> and<00:04:52.990> we're

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:53.230 
copy and paste this down below and we're

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:56.070 
copy and paste this down below and we're
just<00:04:53.410> gonna<00:04:53.530> change<00:04:53.860> the<00:04:54.250> variable<00:04:54.760> and<00:04:55.080> put

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:56.080 
just gonna change the variable and put

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:00.030 
just gonna change the variable and put
minus<00:04:56.470> minus<00:04:57.010> here<00:04:57.220> and<00:04:58.140> press<00:04:59.140> play<00:04:59.440> as<00:04:59.680> you

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:00.040 
minus minus here and press play as you

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:03.750 
minus minus here and press play as you
can<00:05:00.130> see<00:05:00.340> five<00:05:00.970> which<00:05:01.450> is<00:05:01.480> num<00:05:01.990> 2<00:05:02.230> minus<00:05:03.190> 1<00:05:03.490> is

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:03.760 
can see five which is num 2 minus 1 is

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:07.860 
can see five which is num 2 minus 1 is
equal<00:05:03.850> to<00:05:04.720> 4<00:05:04.930> so<00:05:05.890> those<00:05:06.160> were<00:05:06.580> the<00:05:06.970> operators

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:07.870 
equal to 4 so those were the operators
