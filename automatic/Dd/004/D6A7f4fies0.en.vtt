00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:07.870 
good time playing it I the thing is for

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:09.810 
good time playing it I the thing is for
the<00:02:07.900> masses<00:02:08.410> they<00:02:08.560> do<00:02:08.619> like<00:02:08.950> quicker<00:02:09.280> shooters

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:09.820 
the masses they do like quicker shooters

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:12.420 
the masses they do like quicker shooters
where<00:02:10.119> this<00:02:11.019> game<00:02:11.350> is<00:02:11.620> a<00:02:11.650> lot<00:02:11.920> more<00:02:12.100> slower

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
where this game is a lot more slower

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:15.570 
where this game is a lot more slower
pace<00:02:12.820> there<00:02:13.570> will<00:02:13.870> be<00:02:14.049> a<00:02:14.080> market<00:02:14.590> for<00:02:14.620> it<00:02:14.860> and<00:02:15.160> I

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
pace there will be a market for it and I

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.729 
pace there will be a market for it and I
do<00:02:15.640> think<00:02:16.030> it<00:02:16.150> will<00:02:16.330> sell<00:02:16.600> a<00:02:16.810> lot<00:02:17.049> more<00:02:17.230> copies

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:17.739 
do think it will sell a lot more copies

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:19.560 
do think it will sell a lot more copies
this<00:02:17.980> go<00:02:18.190> around<00:02:18.340> but<00:02:18.700> there<00:02:18.880> are<00:02:19.060> a<00:02:19.090> lot<00:02:19.540> of

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:38.230 
totally new innovative system that I'm

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:40.409 
totally new innovative system that I'm
really<00:04:38.470> excited<00:04:38.890> at<00:04:39.160> four<00:04:39.610> and<00:04:39.850> I<00:04:40.060> really

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:40.419 
really excited at four and I really

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:43.290 
really excited at four and I really
really<00:04:40.930> wish<00:04:41.350> it<00:04:41.620> wasn't<00:04:41.950> an<00:04:42.010> xbox<00:04:42.460> and<00:04:42.730> pc

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:43.300 
really wish it wasn't an xbox and pc

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:46.080 
really wish it wasn't an xbox and pc
exclusive<00:04:43.750> if<00:04:44.200> this<00:04:44.350> was<00:04:44.560> on<00:04:44.710> the<00:04:44.800> ps4<00:04:45.130> it

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:46.090 
exclusive if this was on the ps4 it

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:48.960 
exclusive if this was on the ps4 it
would<00:04:46.210> be<00:04:46.330> so<00:04:46.600> much<00:04:46.630> better<00:04:47.160> and<00:04:48.160> I<00:04:48.520> do<00:04:48.580> think

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:48.970 
would be so much better and I do think

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:50.550 
would be so much better and I do think
this<00:04:49.120> would<00:04:49.390> be<00:04:49.419> the<00:04:49.690> cod<00:04:49.900> killer<00:04:50.169> if<00:04:50.380> they

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:50.560 
this would be the cod killer if they

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:53.310 
this would be the cod killer if they
were<00:04:50.800> able<00:04:50.950> to<00:04:51.130> port<00:04:51.460> it<00:04:51.520> over<00:04:51.669> to<00:04:51.910> the<00:04:52.030> ps4<00:04:52.360> but

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:53.320 
were able to port it over to the ps4 but

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:54.239 
were able to port it over to the ps4 but
it's<00:04:53.440> only

00:04:54.239 --> 00:04:54.249 
it's only

00:04:54.249 --> 00:04:57.779 
it's only
one<00:04:54.429> console<00:04:54.999> to<00:04:55.179> console<00:04:55.719> exclusive<00:04:56.349> so<00:04:56.789> it's

00:04:57.779 --> 00:04:57.789 
one console to console exclusive so it's

00:04:57.789 --> 00:05:00.959 
one console to console exclusive so it's
it<00:04:58.419> is<00:04:58.569> limited<00:04:59.019> by<00:04:59.229> that<00:04:59.499> but<00:04:59.799> this<00:05:00.459> could<00:05:00.759> be

00:05:00.959 --> 00:05:00.969 
it is limited by that but this could be

00:05:00.969 --> 00:05:04.199 
it is limited by that but this could be
the<00:05:01.299> greatest<00:05:01.509> FPS<00:05:02.259> game<00:05:02.589> this<00:05:03.399> year<00:05:03.459> over
