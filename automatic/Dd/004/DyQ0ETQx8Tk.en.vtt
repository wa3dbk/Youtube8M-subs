if they were a bit shorter I'd love them

comes<00:05:45.630> with<00:05:45.720> the<00:05:45.919> overlap<00:05:46.919> so<00:05:47.610> they<00:05:48.060> don't<00:05:48.270> get

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:48.630 
comes with the overlap so they don't get

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:51.590 
comes with the overlap so they don't get
you<00:05:48.810> know<00:05:48.930> anything<00:05:49.380> dirty<00:05:50.090> nice<00:05:51.090> separate

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:51.600 
you know anything dirty nice separate

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:54.320
