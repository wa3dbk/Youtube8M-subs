my ipad today which is 3g and opened the
box<00:00:13.009> to<00:00:14.009> see<00:00:14.280> what<00:00:14.460> what<00:00:14.820> is<00:00:15.000> here

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:59.810 

whoa<00:00:37.920> this<00:00:38.920> is<00:00:39.190> really<00:00:39.580> the<00:00:40.150> AB<00:00:40.840> house

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:32.520 

let's<00:01:00.820> see<00:01:01.059> what<00:01:01.210> the<00:01:01.360> inside

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:32.530 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:39.940 

Wow<00:01:33.970> looks<00:01:34.970> like<00:01:35.060> exactly<00:01:38.080> like<00:01:39.080> the<00:01:39.320> one<00:01:39.650> with

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 
Wow looks like exactly like the one with

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:48.050 
Wow looks like exactly like the one with
Wi-Fi<00:01:40.400> version

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.190 

but<00:01:48.689> this<00:01:49.619> is<00:01:49.829> the<00:01:49.890> only<00:01:49.950> difference<00:01:50.930> it<00:01:51.930> has

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
but this is the only difference it has

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.429 
but this is the only difference it has
the<00:01:52.229> black<00:01:53.100> strip<00:01:53.490> on<00:01:53.729> the<00:01:53.759> top<00:01:54.119> I<00:01:54.479> think<00:01:55.229> this

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
the black strip on the top I think this

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:07.600 
the black strip on the top I think this
is<00:01:55.500> what<00:01:56.070> can

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:21.480 

pretty<00:02:08.420> neat<00:02:08.720> black<00:02:09.649> strip

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:21.490 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:27.060 

so<00:02:22.150> let's<00:02:22.330> try<00:02:23.790> try<00:02:24.790> new<00:02:25.500> map<00:02:26.500> application

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:27.070 
so let's try try new map application

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:30.990 
so let's try try new map application
