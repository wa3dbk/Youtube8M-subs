00:00:01.089 --> 00:00:08.740
 4 I'll give you a ramen noodle 

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:08.740
 Well 

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:17.750
 This is one purl'm going to have a look OLLO Polo Contact Now some top 

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:22.489
 It's like this tree. 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:27.019
 This is where the ring is, and the thread is caught and caught again. 

00:00:22.489 --> 00:00:31.970
 The information and the part of this cold that is caught appear on the door like this. 

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:38.210
 The purl will be called the preceding things and will be the same again . 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:41.809
 If the direction of putting the record is from outside to inside 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:45.190
 How is it from outside to inside 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:45.190
 Nose hanging now 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:53.239
 See this way. 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:55.180
 After I plug it in, I walk the seed 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:01:00.789
 Too 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:04.809
 Now , just put the half- counter clockwise around the needle now 

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:07.740
 This allows the wind again now plugged needle 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:07.740
 Counterclockwise 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:17.679
 Dog is inside anyway so'm out back 

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:21.250
 Let me show you again slowly . 

00:01:17.679 --> 00:01:25.040
 Anti-needle 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:29.930
 This looks like this. 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:36.450
 How in the inside right or left outside in the following kkosin 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:40.020
 So now the flowers around the needle so in a counterclockwise direction 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:44.159
 Will destroy pulled give particular 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:47.159
 If we show normal angle again, 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:50.759
 You can do this. 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:54.049
 Now it's a blur . 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:54.049
 I 'll keep trying. 

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:57.130
 like this 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:09.429
 The direction of the wound is exactly the same as that of the bosom. 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:13.570
 I'm working in a counterclockwise reaction in October and I just always have a half word 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:18.640
 When you play poetry, you can think of it in the same direction . 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:24.190
 Well, I do not know yet because I'm not a stronghold, 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:27.760
 Walking in almost the same way as the way it is, 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:32.500
 I just ended up talking about the pattern. 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:35.440
 It 's been a purse here and now it's a shit. 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:40.730
 This'm not the court offered this explanation 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:45.379
 My code statement These last will tell you how to do it 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:49.040
 On my blog there are SquarePants shawl stitch 

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:51.290
 While a plain little bit a little while a purl stitch while more 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:56.840
 It's a way to do some shiny things. 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:03:02.620
 In this case, the poetry is now in the same position, but the purl 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:02.620
 I'll be happy to explain that due to the difference in the next video
