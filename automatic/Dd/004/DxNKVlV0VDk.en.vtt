00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:00.569 
basic colors that if you are on the go

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:02.899 
basic colors that if you are on the go
and<00:03:00.900> you<00:03:00.959> do<00:03:01.169> need<00:03:01.290> to<00:03:01.349> touch<00:03:01.950> up<00:03:01.980> this<00:03:02.609> is<00:03:02.790> like

00:03:02.899 --> 00:03:02.909 
and you do need to touch up this is like

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:05.929 
and you do need to touch up this is like
a<00:03:02.939> perfect<00:03:03.389> crease<00:03:03.889> eyeshadow<00:03:04.889> and<00:03:05.459> this<00:03:05.819> is

00:03:05.929 --> 00:03:05.939 
a perfect crease eyeshadow and this is

00:03:05.939 --> 00:03:07.580 
a perfect crease eyeshadow and this is
like<00:03:06.060> a<00:03:06.090> perfect<00:03:06.540> all<00:03:06.720> over<00:03:07.019> the<00:03:07.109> lid<00:03:07.349> and

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
like a perfect all over the lid and

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.250 
like a perfect all over the lid and
together<00:03:07.919> I<00:03:08.519> think<00:03:08.549> they'd<00:03:08.939> just<00:03:09.150> be<00:03:09.299> great<00:03:09.629> so

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
together I think they'd just be great so

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.140 
together I think they'd just be great so
I<00:03:10.290> got<00:03:10.650> those<00:03:10.889> and<00:03:11.189> then<00:03:11.280> the<00:03:11.430> one<00:03:11.609> already<00:03:11.879> in

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
I got those and then the one already in

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.119 
I got those and then the one already in
here<00:03:12.419> is<00:03:12.540> just<00:03:12.720> a<00:03:12.900> different<00:03:13.319> option<00:03:13.769> for<00:03:14.010> me

00:03:14.119 --> 00:03:14.129 
here is just a different option for me

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:16.309 
here is just a different option for me
it's<00:03:14.370> more<00:03:14.669> of<00:03:14.970> a<00:03:15.120> darker<00:03:15.540> brown<00:03:15.780> so<00:03:16.049> it's<00:03:16.169> also

00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:16.319 
it's more of a darker brown so it's also

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:18.649 
it's more of a darker brown so it's also
really<00:03:16.590> good<00:03:16.859> for<00:03:16.919> like<00:03:17.129> a<00:03:17.250> crease<00:03:17.579> color<00:03:17.879> so<00:03:18.629> I

00:03:18.649 --> 00:03:18.659

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530 
guess I did or they could have made a

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:18.469 
guess I did or they could have made a
mistake<00:04:16.650> I<00:04:17.070> really<00:04:17.340> don't<00:04:17.430> know<00:04:17.639> it<00:04:17.880> says<00:04:18.329> that

00:04:18.469 --> 00:04:18.479 
mistake I really don't know it says that

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:20.330 
mistake I really don't know it says that
hydrates<00:04:18.900> illuminates<00:04:19.409> and<00:04:19.590> projects<00:04:19.950> so<00:04:20.159> i

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340 
hydrates illuminates and projects so i

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:21.360 
hydrates illuminates and projects so i
might<00:04:20.760> use<00:04:20.969> this

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:21.370 
might use this

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:23.820 
might use this
as<00:04:21.430> like<00:04:21.760> a<00:04:21.790> highlight<00:04:22.419> because<00:04:23.020> I<00:04:23.320> really<00:04:23.620> I

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:23.830 
as like a highlight because I really I

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:25.620 
as like a highlight because I really I
tried<00:04:24.280> their<00:04:24.460> other<00:04:24.580> tinted<00:04:25.000> moisturizer<00:04:25.449> and

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:25.630 
tried their other tinted moisturizer and

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:27.629 
tried their other tinted moisturizer and
I<00:04:25.720> wasn't<00:04:25.930> really<00:04:26.169> crazy<00:04:26.470> about<00:04:26.620> it<00:04:26.979> so<00:04:27.220> I'm

00:04:27.629 --> 00:04:27.639 
I wasn't really crazy about it so I'm

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:29.370 
I wasn't really crazy about it so I'm
sure<00:04:27.850> I'll<00:04:27.940> find<00:04:27.970> a<00:04:28.240> use<00:04:28.419> for<00:04:28.449> this<00:04:28.870> though<00:04:29.139> and

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:29.380 
sure I'll find a use for this though and
