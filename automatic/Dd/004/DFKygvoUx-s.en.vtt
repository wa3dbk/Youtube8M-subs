difficult to find these plants anymore
because<00:00:27.140> they<00:00:27.529> they're<00:00:27.980> that<00:00:28.579> old<00:00:28.660> however

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:29.660 
because they they're that old however

because they they're that old however
we're<00:00:30.349> fortunate<00:00:30.590> that<00:00:30.890> they<00:00:31.250> can<00:00:31.520> be<00:00:31.759> grown

00:00:41.229 --> 00:00:41.239 
that form on the old stems you should be

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:43.299 
that form on the old stems you should be

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:49.100 
little plant looks here and this came

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.750 
little plant looks here and this came
actually<00:00:49.399> three<00:00:50.050> lower<00:00:51.050> down<00:00:51.399> with<00:00:52.399> roots

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:52.760 
actually three lower down with roots

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.470 
actually three lower down with roots
that<00:00:53.059> have<00:00:53.300> formed<00:00:53.899> that<00:00:54.469> are<00:00:54.710> perfect<00:00:55.190> for

that have formed that are perfect for

00:00:58.389 --> 00:00:58.399 
removal and potting on what we're going

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:00.009 
removal and potting on what we're going
to<00:00:58.460> do<00:00:58.609> is<00:00:58.850> we're<00:00:58.969> going<00:00:59.030> to<00:00:59.179> cut<00:00:59.449> this<00:00:59.659> cane

00:01:00.009 --> 00:01:00.019 
to do is we're going to cut this cane

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:03.160 
to do is we're going to cut this cane
just<00:01:00.890> below<00:01:01.339> the<00:01:01.640> longest<00:01:02.179> root<00:01:02.449> of<00:01:02.749> the<00:01:02.929> lower

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:03.170 
just below the longest root of the lower

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:05.079 
just below the longest root of the lower
plant<00:01:03.649> lip<00:01:03.829> and<00:01:04.010> then<00:01:04.519> we're<00:01:04.699> going<00:01:04.790> to<00:01:04.879> trim

00:01:05.079 --> 00:01:05.089 
plant lip and then we're going to trim

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:08.830 
plant lip and then we're going to trim
the<00:01:05.269> cane<00:01:05.510> off<00:01:06.250> above<00:01:07.250> the<00:01:07.760> upper<00:01:08.300> plant<00:01:08.630> lip

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:08.840 
the cane off above the upper plant lip

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.050 
the cane off above the upper plant lip
because<00:01:09.290> this<00:01:09.680> is<00:01:09.860> simply<00:01:10.190> going<00:01:10.370> to<00:01:10.520> dry<00:01:10.760> up

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:11.060 
because this is simply going to dry up

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.380 
because this is simply going to dry up
and<00:01:11.810> fall<00:01:12.380> apart<00:01:12.710> you<00:01:13.310> want<00:01:13.520> to<00:01:13.610> use<00:01:13.759> sterile

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:14.390 
and fall apart you want to use sterile

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:16.959 
and fall apart you want to use sterile
