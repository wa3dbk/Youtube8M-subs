00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
piece of origami paper and we're gonna

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.289 
piece of origami paper and we're gonna
turn<00:00:13.080> it<00:00:13.230> over<00:00:13.410> and<00:00:13.679> fold<00:00:14.280> it<00:00:14.429> in<00:00:14.519> half<00:00:14.549> then

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
turn it over and fold it in half then

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.090 
turn it over and fold it in half then
fold<00:00:15.330> it<00:00:15.690> in<00:00:15.780> half<00:00:15.809> the<00:00:16.109> other<00:00:16.199> way<00:00:16.350> and<00:00:16.680> using

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
fold it in half the other way and using

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.500 
fold it in half the other way and using
those<00:00:17.220> centerpieces<00:00:17.609> we<00:00:18.060> made<00:00:18.240> we're<00:00:18.420> gonna

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
those centerpieces we made we're gonna

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.390 
those centerpieces we made we're gonna
fold<00:00:18.779> the<00:00:18.930> end<00:00:19.109> of<00:00:19.289> the<00:00:19.350> paper<00:00:19.500> to<00:00:19.980> the<00:00:20.130> center

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
fold the end of the paper to the center

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:20.660 
fold the end of the paper to the center
crease

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
crease

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:26.029 
crease
on<00:00:20.910> all<00:00:21.150> sides<00:00:24.410> so<00:00:25.410> we<00:00:25.529> should<00:00:25.680> be<00:00:25.710> left<00:00:25.890> with<00:00:25.920> a

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
on all sides so we should be left with a

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:27.800 
on all sides so we should be left with a
bunch<00:00:26.220> of<00:00:26.340> squares<00:00:26.640> that<00:00:26.820> we<00:00:26.939> creased<00:00:27.269> out<00:00:27.449> now

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
bunch of squares that we creased out now

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:28.939 
bunch of squares that we creased out now
we're<00:00:27.960> going<00:00:28.050> to<00:00:28.109> fold<00:00:28.289> the<00:00:28.410> paper<00:00:28.439> diagonally

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
we're going to fold the paper diagonally

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.089 
we're going to fold the paper diagonally
both<00:00:29.550> ways

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:31.099 
both ways

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:33.110

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
to take our edge on the right and edge

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.770 
to take our edge on the right and edge
on<00:00:34.800> the<00:00:34.860> top<00:00:35.070> fold<00:00:35.370> them<00:00:35.550> down<00:00:35.579> and<00:00:36.030> then<00:00:36.360> push

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
and fold it down to the right now we're

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.470 
and fold it down to the right now we're
gonna<00:00:40.860> fold<00:00:41.100> our<00:00:41.280> edit<00:00:41.520> on<00:00:41.670> the<00:00:41.700> left<00:00:41.940> side<00:00:42.180> or

and<00:00:52.079> then<00:00:52.289> bring<00:00:52.500> those<00:00:52.620> two<00:00:52.920> corners<00:00:53.160> out<00:00:53.539> so

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
and then bring those two corners out so

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.439 
and then bring those two corners out so
it<00:00:54.719> shouldn't<00:00:54.989> look<00:00:55.320> like<00:00:55.530> this<00:00:56.329> now<00:00:57.329> we're

gonna turn it over and you should have a
square<00:00:59.820> shape<00:01:00.180> popping<00:01:00.600> out<00:01:00.750> we're<00:01:00.960> gonna

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
square shape popping out we're gonna

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.720 
square shape popping out we're gonna
fold<00:01:01.320> this<00:01:01.559> shape<00:01:01.800> in<00:01:01.980> half<00:01:02.160> and<00:01:02.370> then<00:01:02.550> take

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
fold this shape in half and then take

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.369 
fold this shape in half and then take
the<00:01:02.879> bottom<00:01:03.059> edge<00:01:03.329> of<00:01:03.449> that<00:01:03.539> square<00:01:03.899> and<00:01:04.140> fold

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
the bottom edge of that square and fold

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.469 
the bottom edge of that square and fold
it<00:01:04.470> to<00:01:04.559> the<00:01:04.650> center<00:01:04.680> again<00:01:05.100> on<00:01:05.430> both<00:01:05.610> sides<00:01:05.939> top

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
it to the center again on both sides top

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.990 
it to the center again on both sides top
and<00:01:06.540> bottom

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:11.000 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.280 

unfold<00:01:12.000> it<00:01:12.119> to<00:01:12.270> turn<00:01:12.479> the<00:01:12.570> paper<00:01:12.720> to<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:13.020> side

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
unfold it to turn the paper to the side

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.200 
unfold it to turn the paper to the side
fold<00:01:13.710> it<00:01:13.799> in<00:01:13.890> half<00:01:13.920> together<00:01:14.220> right<00:01:14.610> use<00:01:14.970> that

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
fold it in half together right use that

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:21.290 
fold it in half together right use that
crease<00:01:15.540> to<00:01:16.049> fold<00:01:16.409> the<00:01:16.560> edges<00:01:16.710> in<00:01:16.950> again

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:21.300 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.820 

you<00:01:22.300> should<00:01:22.450> be<00:01:22.570> left<00:01:22.720> with<00:01:22.810> this<00:01:23.080> and<00:01:23.320> now

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:23.830 
you should be left with this and now

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:25.650 
you should be left with this and now
comes<00:01:24.160> the<00:01:24.310> really<00:01:24.520> tricky<00:01:24.820> part<00:01:24.970> we're<00:01:25.570> gonna

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:25.660 
comes the really tricky part we're gonna

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:27.420 
comes the really tricky part we're gonna
put<00:01:25.870> our<00:01:25.990> hand<00:01:26.230> down<00:01:26.410> flat<00:01:26.650> up<00:01:27.010> to<00:01:27.220> the<00:01:27.310> edge

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:27.430 
put our hand down flat up to the edge

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:29.310 
put our hand down flat up to the edge
you<00:01:27.460> created<00:01:28.030> pull<00:01:28.240> that<00:01:28.360> pocket<00:01:28.720> down<00:01:28.870> and

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:29.320 
you created pull that pocket down and

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.650 
you created pull that pocket down and
then<00:01:29.560> fold<00:01:30.100> it<00:01:30.220> to<00:01:30.370> a<00:01:30.400> triangle<00:01:30.850> shape<00:01:31.330> do<00:01:31.540> the

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:31.660 
then fold it to a triangle shape do the

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:33.180 
then fold it to a triangle shape do the
same<00:01:31.810> to<00:01:31.990> the<00:01:32.080> other<00:01:32.260> side<00:01:32.350> we're<00:01:32.860> gonna<00:01:32.920> pull

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:33.190 
same to the other side we're gonna pull

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:35.040 
same to the other side we're gonna pull
it<00:01:33.280> down<00:01:33.490> fold<00:01:34.090> the<00:01:34.210> sides<00:01:34.420> into<00:01:34.570> a<00:01:34.750> triangle

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:35.050 
it down fold the sides into a triangle

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:38.960 
it down fold the sides into a triangle
shape<00:01:36.120> so<00:01:37.120> they<00:01:37.390> should<00:01:37.540> look<00:01:37.750> like<00:01:37.780> this<00:01:38.110> now

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
shape so they should look like this now

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.740 
shape so they should look like this now
we're<00:01:39.970> going<00:01:40.060> to<00:01:40.150> turn<00:01:40.240> the<00:01:40.330> paper<00:01:40.480> to<00:01:40.720> the

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:40.750 
we're going to turn the paper to the

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:42.840 
we're going to turn the paper to the
side<00:01:41.020> take<00:01:41.560> the<00:01:41.680> two<00:01:41.860> edges<00:01:42.190> and<00:01:42.220> fold<00:01:42.490> them<00:01:42.700> in

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:42.850 
side take the two edges and fold them in

and make the corners in it so we're

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:47.340
