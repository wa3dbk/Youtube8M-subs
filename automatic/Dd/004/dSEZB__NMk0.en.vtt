00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:07.710
 hi dear friends I am cave of 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:12.330
 platone and today we will try to find out 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.809
 who is dylan dog or maybe who is tiziano 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.900
 sclavi 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.580
 or maybe neither of these things 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.199
 video is not a review 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:24.320
 I just want to digress 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:24.320
 on dylan dog clearly after the initials 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:42.610
 dylan dog is a London detective who 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:45.640
 investigate cases we call them not 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:48.460
 conventional crimes and mysteries that 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:50.379
 they have to do with the paranormal they are the 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:52.720
 his area of ​​expertise 

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:56.500
 the nightmare investigator is an ex 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:58.930
 ex alcoholic police officer ex boyfriend 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:01.629
 a penniless who lives in a kind of 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:03.250
 horror museum surrounding itself with 

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:05.740
 evidence of his skepticism 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:09.100
 despite having faced demons 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:11.380
 alien zombies and death itself 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:14.440
 his life partner is a double of 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:16.300
 groucho marx which often turns out to be a 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:19.750
 better detective than his boss who 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:22.240
 what is a dylan dog a cartoon a 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:25.289
 certain character but also a mirror 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:29.050
 which reflects through its creator 

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:31.720
 Titian sclavi the straight image of a 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:34.270
 society distorted slaves in his 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:37.179
 stories offers tools for 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:39.160
 transform readers into inquirers and 

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:42.189
 better understand the world in which 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:46.330
 we live the monstrous creatures described 

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:49.090
 sclaves are enigmatic details 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:51.159
 the author is not necessarily evil 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.890
 side for the misunderstood and disposable 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:55.720
 light on those who are the real monsters 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:59.079
 of the company 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:01.000
 a bit like brian yuzna society the key 

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:03.040
 reading for torn stories is 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.520
 determinant 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:08.890
 the monsters we are the horror hides 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:12.040
 behind an angelic face in his hands 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:14.340
 tapered of a girl veiled by 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.340
 good intentions 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:17.769
 from this point of view the zombies 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.230
 they seem almost real true 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:22.780
 dylan dog's success is everything from 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:24.850
 impute his creator a comic 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:28.570
 popular selling more than a million 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:32.890
 copies and pure has no art released from 

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:35.799
 preconceptions behind a masterpiece 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:37.959
 there is always a great author with a 

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:39.850
 capital letter to make a man born 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:43.750
 success the components to use are 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:46.000
 multiple is not enough to know how to narrate 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.350
 also need the stories to hit the 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.310
 audience 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:50.380
 maybe 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:54.400
 discovering or rediscovering part of itself in 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:57.430
 those sclavi pages could do this 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:03:01.239
 according to the Bonelli Dylan collaborators 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:05.349
 he is dressed as Titian lived in 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:07.330
 comic the real nightmares of the author in 

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:09.849
 a sense the craven detective 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.450
 road and the mental projection of his 

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:12.519
 author 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:15.310
 then we can imagine the series a 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:17.410
 comics as a long diary rather than a 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:20.470
 mosaic created with cinema pieces 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:22.890
 splatter horror influenced by yellows 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:26.380
 dylan dog is a modern sherlock holmes 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:28.209
 the clarinet plays instead of the violin 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:30.340
 position he assumes when he meditates in 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:33.489
 armchair and joint is that of 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:35.890
 baker street detectives and quoting more 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:38.709
 or not a topical sentence discard all 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:41.470
 the possible hypotheses what remains is 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:43.239
 the nightmare the misfortune of dylan dog is 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:45.970
 that of not being written by a 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:48.400
 compliant author of the caliber of arthur 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:51.690
 conan doyle and written by tiziano sclavi 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:54.040
 and inevitably it must be concrete 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.820
 therefore he cannot afford abductions 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:57.340
 of the case 

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:59.829
 it also has no deductive method leaves 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:01.329
 that it is his fifth and half sense a 

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:03.730
 sniff out the right track 

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:06.340
 can be easily duped by 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:09.069
 women a modern sherlock holmes 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:10.390
 rather awkward to admit it 

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:13.269
 and wanting to make a comparison there 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:15.519
 Dylan's successful fallibility recalls 

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:17.709
 plus the intrusion of randomness into 

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:19.510
 durrenmatt whites asked me to 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:22.389
 such as the story written by Titian 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:24.789
 sclavi that I prefer I always remain 

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:27.220
 fascinated by the story inside the 

00:04:24.789 --> 00:04:29.889
 story I 'm a fan of the goal 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:31.600
 narrative so you will already have understood that 

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:34.840
 the number 25 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:37.510
 morgana remains motionless in my heart e 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:39.700
 in my mind a dreamlike journey into the 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:42.340
 cartoon inside the comic 

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:45.510
 the strength that a story can have in 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:49.570
 create a series of alternative realities 

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:51.910
 real perhaps or perhaps only in the hearts of 

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:52.650
 readers who tear each other apart 

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:56.080
 different 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:59.580
 especially mine in particular 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:02.350
 when listening to the notes of roberto mura 

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:04.570
 so dylan dog is a character in 

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:07.690
 nurse of events written by Titian 

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:09.580
 sclavi and tiziano sclavi is a person 

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:12.790
 who lives at the mercy of the events of the 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:15.100
 life are two different people where 

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:16.810
 the one begins and where the other ends 

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:18.730
 maybe they are both characters 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:19.870
 fictitious living in the minds of the 

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:22.180
 audience 

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:24.820
 who can say we can understand who he is 

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:28.380
 an author based on the stories that 

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:31.290
 clearly writes no we shall sin of 

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:33.580
 superficiality and arrogance though 

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:37.000
 reading at least dylan dog 

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:40.600
 the impression of knowing a little bit of tiziano 

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.440
 sclavi and maybe even a little more than us 

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:43.900
 themselves 

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:46.210
 now the ball has gone from sclavi to 

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:50.200
 roberto recchioni designated as 

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:52.330
 editor of the magazine dylan dog regions 

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:55.270
 I love you and todi has entered the heart of 

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:57.639
 many torn apart thanks to the mater story 

00:05:55.270 --> 00:06:00.639
 morbi that maybe the one that reflects of 

00:05:57.639 --> 00:06:02.889
 the more the sclavia spirit is not a story 

00:06:00.639 --> 00:06:05.860
 what an impression the reader has where 

00:06:02.889 --> 00:06:08.800
 the author puts some of himself and pinches of the 

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:10.830
 references that also know how to talk 

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:13.780
 of himself outside the scope 

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:15.789
 cartoonist roberto recchioni and maybe 

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:18.220
 the most incisive screenwriter of the 

00:06:15.789 --> 00:06:20.560
 Italian comic panorama but 

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:22.690
 honestly I never managed to 

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:25.780
 fully appreciate mater morbi 

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:30.090
 because as a good hypochondriac I am 

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:30.090
 I relax a lot in hospitals
