 all the most famous manga characters 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.950

 this one on the left with the hair e 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.369

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:13.560

 strange guys because we will try to do 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:21.840
 the strangest struggles the most meetings 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.220
 impossible that you can see you have 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.990

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:30.299

 let's go and do this here today because 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.450
 already something in mind for the match 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.430
 then 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.680
 I'm not a little Japanese then 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:45.750
 because the game is never a non 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:47.730
 will never be released in Europe for all rights 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.380
 because the rights of the various send us the 

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:51.360
 have various publishing houses see the 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:55.470

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:02.700
 red looks great rufy monkey d 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.340
 luffy in Japanese version is called 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:08.100
 aluffi because the Japanese do not have the 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:12.030
 l say the l there directly 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:14.880

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:23.480
 suddenly I started doing 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:26.760
 michael jackson 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:28.680
 graphically it reminds me very much indeed 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.940
 just one piece pirate wilders that 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.799
 combined shit 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:34.980
 I guess I kind of got transformed 

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:37.590
 made a kind of bandwidth power up 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:40.620
 hunchback admitted the low difficulty I believe 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:43.380
 never gatling camus como no gatling fi 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:47.010

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:49.980

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:51.840
 gatling your field 30 damn it 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:54.080
 which we broke the house o 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:56.540
 broken down a house 

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:59.510
 this looks like the missing dog 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:02.720
 however made the teleporter changes or 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:04.250
 bazooka but do 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:09.470
 I always dreamed of beating goku 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:12.410
 frowns gam gam gatlin was saying 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:15.940
 then not the second who was good 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:17.450
 with coca what the cat said that that 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:21.799
 legumes 

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:25.400
 this seems to me to be like it 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:27.340
 called the arena of naruto the village 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:29.630
 of the leaf a thing of the kind 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:33.470
 who knows if I throw it down if I can 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:36.290
 throw down the bazooka that shit 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:39.140
 combined life without knowing the keys 

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:43.010
 guys without knowing the keys victor ibra 

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:46.880
 I'm about to win or who is this here and 

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:48.320
 reggiano la bamba, however, this exhibition 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:50.030
 I have n't seen it yet, I don't spoil it at 

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:51.860
 his one-piece lieutenant boys 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:55.100
 because I came to when he died 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:57.200
 and I waged wars again 

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:59.900
 tribeca that succeeded press three a 

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:03.650
 here's how I made that move here 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:05.750
 see is pressing the keys randomly never that 

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:07.220
 I almost finished but then it seems to me that 

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:08.919
 the school jazz energies of everything 

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:10.250
 how much because still goku does not die 

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:13.160
 dead 

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:14.960

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:18.230

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:22.430
 third gear excuse me yet because I do 

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:24.320
 michael jackson gamc by hand but still 

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:27.890
 he is not dead but how many times I owe you 

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:30.320
 however, killing my mom was really right 

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:33.200
 the strength of six years later by anyway 

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:36.140
 below it gave me my own ground gam 

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:39.320
 another kick in the face another 

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:42.020
 soccer and in the pa that I had my own 

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:46.000

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:50.750
 with birther heels from his own 

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:54.169
