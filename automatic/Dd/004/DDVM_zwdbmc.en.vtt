00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:12.020
 hello everyone welcome to a new 

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:14.209
 web video prepare yourself in this 

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:16.390
 case the video is dedicated to a new 

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:20.460
 pk model 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:24.029
 Failure of the function selector 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:26.509
 a pretty typical failure in this in 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.509
 these models 

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:32.300
 to proceed to replace it if 

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:34.610
 you brought the oven in the cabin where 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:37.010
 was placed the cap is removed 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:39.290
 of the controls that carry the 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:42.570
 screws on the side and on the other 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:44.640
 lateral and we have 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.570
 the timer 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:51.070
 Function indicators 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:53.660
 the thermostat and the function selector 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:57.270
 the rest of the elements already correspond 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:59.970
 when they load the glass ceramic 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:02.300
 to replace the function selector 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:05.760
 what we have to do is first 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:08.370
 mark all the contacts where they go 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:11.250
 placed if we can take some pictures 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:12.990
 of them also to be clear 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.090
 where are we each and do not make mistakes 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.759
 when it comes to reassembling 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.799
 and to replace it the button is removed 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:22.049
 front the two screws that are 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:24.500
 takes and leaves the entire selector by the 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:28.810
 back 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:31.840
 everything is already disconnected the computer 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:34.430
 pulls out all the cables 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:37.250
 identifying the same 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:38.740
 I have made a sheet with the silkscreen in 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:41.770
 the huelva street 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:44.020
 and now it's going to proceed to take out the 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:46.290
 button on the front of the 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.290
 same 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:53.910
 for disassembly of the front there was 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:53.910
 take out all the screws of each button 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:01.080
 take out some screws that you carry in the 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:01.080
 back 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:08.289
 and remove the hooks that it carries in the 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:11.550
 laterally moving the lid laterally 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:11.550
 it comes out 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:17.500
 we are free 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:21.400
 the whole top and we already have 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:24.120
 access to the screws to remove the 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.120
 part of the switch 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.600
 we will leave the same and we can proceed to 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.180
 replace it 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:41.950
 once the spare is obtained 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:44.520
 we will proceed to assemble it to place the 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:47.280
 lower screw 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:49.110
 I advise you to use a screwdriver 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.980
 magnetized since it is quite complicated 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.980
 insert it 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:10.480
 we will hold the screw 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:15.049
 first of all 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:18.290
 Hello 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:25.250
 i 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:25.250
 and the screw being held 

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:33.200
 we proceed to place in his position the 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:33.200
 computer 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:41.730
 but we have fixed 

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:46.490
 and now we will fix the front screw and 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:47.819
 we will proceed to reconnect the 

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:51.090
 cables 

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:54.980
 to place the cables we will proceed in 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:54.980
 reverse order as we have removed 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:13.630
 always fixing 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:16.110
 where does each connection number go 

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:16.110
 We have seen 

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:48.990
 once all the cables are placed 

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:53.420
 we assure that they remain 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:53.420
 pretty fixed that do not move 

00:04:54.129 --> 00:04:59.819
 and we proceed to place the 

00:04:56.529 --> 00:05:03.540
 frontal to the same left with a small 

00:04:59.819 --> 00:05:05.820
 tab that takes in the inner part 

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:07.800
 and on the top 

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:11.670
 we had deconstructed it back to 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:16.040
 connect and we will place again 

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:16.040
 all buttons on the front 

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:25.340
 how will you understand filming all these 

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:27.320
 videos holding the camera with one hand 

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:30.350
 working with the other is a little 

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:33.139
 complicated that's why many times you do not see 

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:37.660
 in the videos all that really is 

00:05:33.139 --> 00:05:37.660
 could or should have hope not 

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:43.430
 we put the green button 

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:47.500
 and later 

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:47.500
 the rest since everyone is equally 

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:52.610
 ah 

00:05:55.190 --> 00:06:01.990
 once assembled all assembled 

00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:01.990
 fastened the screws on the sides 

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:10.920
 we proceed to buy the oven and have 

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:10.920
 gone to work 

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:24.400
 As you can see the selection of 

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:26.590
 functions goes perfectly no longer 

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:28.830
 turn off the indicator as it happened 

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:28.830
 previously 

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:36.199
 I wait for you in the video although this time not 

00:06:33.919 --> 00:06:39.139
 too elaborate can serve us as 

00:06:36.199 --> 00:06:42.380
 help and that when you have to change 

00:06:39.139 --> 00:06:44.569
 a computer in a furnace do not have a 

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:48.139
 little bit lighter 

00:06:44.569 --> 00:06:50.599
 and in another video we will see how to change the 

00:06:48.139 --> 00:06:54.800
 inner bulb since they were at the 

00:06:50.599 --> 00:06:56.270
 it has melted and the castle is broken 

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:58.759
 so you have to take it out for the part 

00:06:56.270 --> 00:07:01.309
 later a greeting and that you follow 

00:06:58.759 --> 00:07:03.909
 visiting the web repair your point or 

00:07:01.309 --> 00:07:03.909
 heretic
