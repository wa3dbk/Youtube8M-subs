00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:55.810 
since the headpiece covers a majority of

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:00.610 
specific pattern but I don't think it's

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:03.590 
specific pattern but I don't think it's
really<00:05:00.970> that<00:05:01.000> easy<00:05:01.360> to<00:05:01.600> mess<00:05:01.810> up<00:05:01.990> diamonds<00:05:02.680> I
