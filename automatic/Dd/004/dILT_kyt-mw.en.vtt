ear headphones now you may be noticing
why<00:00:14.040> do<00:00:14.099> you<00:00:14.250> have<00:00:14.400> two<00:00:14.670> different<00:00:15.330> pairs<00:00:15.599> of

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
why do you have two different pairs of

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.630 
why do you have two different pairs of
headphones<00:00:16.020> in<00:00:16.410> front<00:00:16.590> of<00:00:16.680> you<00:00:16.800> and<00:00:17.070> that<00:00:17.490> is

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
mainly because there are actually

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.890 
mainly because there are actually
different<00:00:19.350> types<00:00:19.830> of<00:00:20.130> the<00:00:20.760> JVC<00:00:21.390> extreme

which<00:00:28.890> are<00:00:29.070> essentially<00:00:29.460> the<00:00:29.490> same<00:00:29.730> thing

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
which are essentially the same thing

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.310 
which are essentially the same thing
except<00:00:30.510> the<00:00:30.689> 3<00:00:31.050> X<00:00:31.230> has<00:00:31.859> a<00:00:32.550> metal<00:00:33.390> inside<00:00:33.870> driver

for<00:00:35.070> better<00:00:35.309> build<00:00:35.579> quality<00:00:35.640> and<00:00:36.270> then

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
for better build quality and then

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.330 
for better build quality and then

they both have 10 minimum 8 millimeter

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.549 
they both have 10 minimum 8 millimeter
drivers<00:01:03.030> now<00:01:03.719> if<00:01:03.899> you<00:01:04.019> don't<00:01:04.140> know<00:01:04.320> what<00:01:04.409> that

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
drivers now if you don't know what that

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.140 
drivers now if you don't know what that
is<00:01:04.589> that's<00:01:04.890> basically<00:01:05.040> meaning<00:01:05.610> they<00:01:05.850> are

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
is that's basically meaning they are

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.899 
is that's basically meaning they are
kind<00:01:06.689> of<00:01:06.780> big<00:01:06.990> so<00:01:07.680> when<00:01:08.070> they<00:01:08.220> have<00:01:08.400> sticking

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
kind of big so when they have sticking

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.190 
kind of big so when they have sticking
out<00:01:09.000> of<00:01:09.060> your<00:01:09.119> ear<00:01:09.360> you<00:01:09.540> may<00:01:09.659> not<00:01:09.840> want<00:01:10.020> to<00:01:10.080> be

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
out of your ear you may not want to be

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.719 
out of your ear you may not want to be
lying<00:01:10.470> down<00:01:10.710> on<00:01:10.770> your<00:01:10.920> side<00:01:11.280> while<00:01:11.520> using

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
lying down on your side while using

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.760 
lying down on your side while using
these<00:01:12.000> as<00:01:12.240> they're<00:01:12.930> a<00:01:12.960> little<00:01:13.140> too<00:01:13.320> bit<00:01:13.470> to<00:01:13.619> be

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
these as they're a little too bit to be

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.520 
these as they're a little too bit to be
lying<00:01:14.010> down<00:01:14.250> with<00:01:14.520> but<00:01:15.240> besides<00:01:15.960> that<00:01:16.290> they're

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
lying down with but besides that they're

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.859 
lying down with but besides that they're
not<00:01:16.680> overly<00:01:17.280> intrusive<00:01:17.700> and<00:01:18.240> they're<00:01:18.659> very

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
not overly intrusive and they're very

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.480 
not overly intrusive and they're very
comfortable<00:01:19.170> when<00:01:19.530> you<00:01:19.619> put<00:01:19.770> them<00:01:19.860> in<00:01:19.979> the<00:01:20.070> ear

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
comfortable when you put them in the ear

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.679 
comfortable when you put them in the ear
the<00:01:21.119> same<00:01:21.330> thing<00:01:21.509> goes<00:01:21.540> for<00:01:21.720> the<00:01:22.020> HAF<00:01:22.619> X<00:01:23.119> 101<00:01:24.119> VR

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
the same thing goes for the HAF X 101 VR

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.050 
the same thing goes for the HAF X 101 VR
except<00:01:25.590> this<00:01:25.799> has<00:01:26.009> 8<00:01:26.280> millimeter<00:01:26.790> drivers

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
except this has 8 millimeter drivers

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.719 
except this has 8 millimeter drivers
instead<00:01:27.750> of<00:01:27.869> the<00:01:27.990> 10<00:01:28.229> so<00:01:28.799> it's<00:01:29.009> smaller<00:01:29.400> and

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
instead of the 10 so it's smaller and

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.080 
instead of the 10 so it's smaller and
this<00:01:30.360> way<00:01:30.600> they're<00:01:31.320> not<00:01:31.470> as<00:01:31.820> obtrusive<00:01:32.820> so<00:01:33.000> you

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
this way they're not as obtrusive so you

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.219 
this way they're not as obtrusive so you
wouldn't<00:01:33.329> really<00:01:33.450> notice<00:01:33.659> them<00:01:33.900> while<00:01:34.049> lying

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
wouldn't really notice them while lying

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.649 
wouldn't really notice them while lying
down<00:01:34.380> and<00:01:34.829> they<00:01:35.670> just<00:01:35.700> don't<00:01:36.030> stick<00:01:36.360> out<00:01:36.479> as

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
down and they just don't stick out as

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.960 
down and they just don't stick out as
much<00:01:36.810> so<00:01:37.079> they're<00:01:37.229> more<00:01:37.470> like<00:01:37.680> regular<00:01:38.009> in-ear

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
much so they're more like regular in-ear

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.510 
much so they're more like regular in-ear

they have ten millimeter drivers now

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.490 
they have ten millimeter drivers now
this<00:01:50.759> means<00:01:51.060> that<00:01:51.270> this<00:01:51.899> is<00:01:52.079> going<00:01:52.140> to<00:01:52.259> get

this means that this is going to get

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.030 
this means that this is going to get
absolutely<00:01:53.100> great<00:01:53.430> base<00:01:53.670> to<00:01:53.850> begin<00:01:53.970> with<00:01:54.299> now

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:55.040 
absolutely great base to begin with now

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.770 
absolutely great base to begin with now
what<00:01:56.040> would<00:01:56.159> I<00:01:56.250> compare<00:01:56.640> these<00:01:56.880> two<00:01:57.119> I<00:01:57.329> would

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
be saying what's the big difference

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.800 
be saying what's the big difference
between<00:02:51.420> this<00:02:51.840> and<00:02:52.020> the<00:02:52.920> 3x<00:02:53.610> and<00:02:53.880> the<00:02:54.030> 1x<00:02:54.390> they

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
between this and the 3x and the 1x they

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:56.840 
between this and the 3x and the 1x they
have<00:02:54.990> 8<00:02:55.200> millimeter<00:02:55.710> drivers<00:02:55.980> instead<00:02:56.610> of<00:02:56.700> the

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
have 8 millimeter drivers instead of the

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.540 
have 8 millimeter drivers instead of the
tens<00:02:57.120> and<00:02:57.450> the<00:02:57.840> other<00:02:58.260> two<00:02:58.650> in<00:02:59.010> your

tens and the other two in your

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:02.180 
tens and the other two in your
