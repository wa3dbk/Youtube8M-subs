sonic<00:00:06.779> boom<00:00:06.960> here<00:00:07.550> little<00:00:08.550> tip<00:00:08.730> not<00:00:09.090> the<00:00:09.240> best

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
sonic boom here little tip not the best

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:12.740 
sonic boom here little tip not the best
one<00:00:09.630> to<00:00:09.809> use<00:00:10.429> because<00:00:11.429> she<00:00:12.300> said<00:00:12.450> he<00:00:12.509> got<00:00:12.630> two

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
one to use because she said he got two

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.310 
one to use because she said he got two
attacks<00:00:13.139> and<00:00:13.849> how<00:00:14.849> I've<00:00:15.210> attack<00:00:15.570> I<00:00:15.900> think<00:00:16.260> the

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
attacks and how I've attack I think the

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.560 
attacks and how I've attack I think the
egg<00:00:16.470> toss<00:00:16.770> is<00:00:17.130> the<00:00:17.490> best<00:00:17.699> to<00:00:17.850> use<00:00:18.000> here<00:00:18.270> but

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
egg toss is the best to use here but

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.210 
egg toss is the best to use here but
it's<00:00:18.810> also<00:00:18.960> not<00:00:19.140> very<00:00:19.199> accurate<00:00:19.529> like<00:00:20.100> the

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
it's also not very accurate like the

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.790 
it's also not very accurate like the
other<00:00:20.340> ones<00:00:20.550> can<00:00:20.760> be<00:00:21.619> still<00:00:24.289> I've<00:00:25.289> got<00:00:25.500> to<00:00:25.650> say

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
other ones can be still I've got to say

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.230 
other ones can be still I've got to say
I've<00:00:25.890> got<00:00:26.010> 16<00:00:26.400> at<00:00:26.490> the<00:00:26.519> moment<00:00:26.849> so<00:00:26.910> they're<00:00:27.119> all

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
I've got 16 at the moment so they're all

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.880 
I've got 16 at the moment so they're all
got<00:00:27.420> to<00:00:27.510> do<00:00:27.630> eventually<00:00:27.990> so<00:00:28.939> my<00:00:29.939> cap<00:00:30.119> area<00:00:30.890> and

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
got to do eventually so my cap area and

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.680 
got to do eventually so my cap area and
it<00:00:31.980> comes<00:00:32.160> the<00:00:32.250> bad<00:00:32.430> guys<00:00:32.669> at<00:00:32.790> this<00:00:32.850> level<00:00:33.059> if

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
it comes the bad guys at this level if

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:39.290 
it comes the bad guys at this level if
you<00:00:33.840> can<00:00:34.050> avoid<00:00:34.350> them<00:00:35.090> if<00:00:36.090> not<00:00:37.790> just<00:00:38.790> you<00:00:39.270> know

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
you can avoid them if not just you know

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.319 
you can avoid them if not just you know
go<00:00:39.540> around<00:00:39.840> them<00:00:40.219> and<00:00:41.219> becomes<00:00:41.550> advisors<00:00:42.059> I've

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
go around them and becomes advisors I've

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.869 
go around them and becomes advisors I've
never<00:00:42.809> done<00:00:42.989> a<00:00:43.050> level<00:00:43.469> and<00:00:43.710> I<00:00:44.100> not<00:00:44.430> broken<00:00:44.670> any

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
never done a level and I not broken any

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.790 
never done a level and I not broken any
that<00:00:45.239> makes<00:00:45.420> sense<00:00:45.629> so<00:00:46.530> you're<00:00:46.649> going<00:00:46.739> to

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
that makes sense so you're going to

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.400 
that makes sense so you're going to
break<00:00:46.980> the<00:00:47.160> old<00:00:47.280> one<00:00:47.489> now<00:00:47.820> and<00:00:47.969> again<00:00:48.210> if<00:00:49.140> it

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
break the old one now and again if it

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.459 
break the old one now and again if it
can<00:00:50.449> you<00:00:51.449> say<00:00:51.570> you<00:00:51.629> try<00:00:51.870> to<00:00:51.930> avoid<00:00:52.079> as<00:00:52.199> many<00:00:52.320> as

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
can you say you try to avoid as many as

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.720 
can you say you try to avoid as many as
you<00:00:52.559> can<00:00:53.480> but<00:00:54.770> one<00:00:55.770> thing<00:00:56.010> don't<00:00:56.309> waste<00:00:56.520> time

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
you can but one thing don't waste time

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.610 
you can but one thing don't waste time
sometimes<00:00:57.210> not<00:00:57.690> trying<00:00:58.020> to<00:00:58.109> break<00:00:58.260> of<00:00:58.469> ours

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
sometimes not trying to break of ours

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.439 
sometimes not trying to break of ours
that<00:00:58.949> makes<00:00:59.309> sense<00:00:59.520> because<00:00:59.670> sometimes<00:01:00.180> it's

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
that makes sense because sometimes it's

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.160 
that makes sense because sometimes it's
been<00:01:00.570> to<00:01:00.660> a<00:01:00.690> time<00:01:00.899> not<00:01:01.170> doing<00:01:01.469> that<00:01:01.500> and<00:01:03.170> well

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
been to a time not doing that and well

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.929 
been to a time not doing that and well
you're<00:01:04.409> wasting<00:01:04.799> precious<00:01:04.830> time<00:01:05.129> and<00:01:05.610> this

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
you're wasting precious time and this

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:10.510 
you're wasting precious time and this
level<00:01:06.299> you<00:01:06.510> just<00:01:06.750> can't<00:01:06.930> do<00:01:07.110> that

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:10.520 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.279 

another<00:01:11.520> knowing<00:01:11.789> thing<00:01:12.179> the<00:01:12.569> bad<00:01:12.719> guys<00:01:12.990> break

00:01:13.279 --> 00:01:13.289 
another knowing thing the bad guys break

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:16.069 
another knowing thing the bad guys break
of<00:01:13.439> ours<00:01:13.619> you'll<00:01:14.460> get<00:01:14.609> points<00:01:14.939> off<00:01:15.210> your<00:01:15.600> score

00:01:16.069 --> 00:01:16.079 
of ours you'll get points off your score

00:01:16.079 --> 00:01:20.630 
of ours you'll get points off your score
for<00:01:17.450> those<00:01:18.450> glasses<00:01:18.750> there<00:01:19.049> you'll<00:01:19.439> never<00:01:19.740> not

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
for those glasses there you'll never not

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.609 
for those glasses there you'll never not
break<00:01:20.909> them<00:01:21.090> that<00:01:21.270> makes<00:01:21.479> sense<00:01:21.689> you<00:01:22.289> have<00:01:22.439> to

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
break them that makes sense you have to

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.110 
break them that makes sense you have to
break<00:01:22.799> those<00:01:22.950> two

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:26.120 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:29.270 

and<00:01:27.120> the<00:01:27.210> bars<00:01:27.420> here<00:01:27.810> you<00:01:28.440> have<00:01:28.710> to<00:01:28.890> break<00:01:29.070> this

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
and the bars here you have to break this

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.920 
and the bars here you have to break this
files<00:01:29.580> because<00:01:29.880> if<00:01:30.120> not<00:01:30.240> you<00:01:30.420> can't<00:01:30.630> get<00:01:30.810> the
