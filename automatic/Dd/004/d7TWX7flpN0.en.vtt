00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.389
 hello to all and welcome to this 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:04.470
 minecraft tutorial so today I 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:06.390
 will show you how to make a 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.030
 counter in minecraft so this is a 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.460
 pulse counter so there Redstone 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.500
 we are already in you will see I send 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.160
 an impulse for that lasts I send a 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.039
 other impulse 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.690
 we think of three and another pressure on 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.320
 think of 4 which you understood the 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.820
 principle 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.039
 so this model the accountant can 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:27.000
 simply sectioned up to a maximum 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:29.789
 of 14.6 still what is still 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.710
 gala for counting so I'm going to you 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.809
 explain how it works and then 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.730
 at home we will build it together 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.110
 so now I'm going to explain 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.899
 how does it work then that's all 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.280
 simply we have an object in a two or 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.379
 I could not put anything I 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.489
 promises of this block then one object of a 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:50.010
 airport that was going from the comparator 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:52.469
 detects the current stay calm between 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.570
 our torch is simply why 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.430
 another object scrolls not work or 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.530
 by which are positioned in loop 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.770
 simply because it is locked 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.149
 alive of this torch from this line of 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.500
 redstone and just that they are going 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.600
 send the impulse hop it's going 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.610
 unlock a split second 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.880
 our son simply so that 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:14.250
 our object not from the first to the port to the 2nd 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:17.850
 or by x is automatically blocked 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.590
 in this one to not scroll to 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:23.700
 through the others by you will see 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:26.130
 this repeater of the assets this torch and 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.979
 the other hakapik hipster reactivates the 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.229
 redstone current in a time that will make 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:34.470
 which allows our machine to 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:38.310
 operate you're going to see sums and that 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:40.650
 allows us to think not another 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.700
 so we will build it together 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.049
 so now we will build 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.700
 together to go see it's really 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:47.369
 nice build it takes the resistant 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:50.369
 comparators of repeat order or by 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:52.680
 a torch stands a button and some 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:56.219
 building blocks just there on 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.799
 will make the platform of a whore who will 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:03.160
 enable us to activate a repulsion 

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:06.590
 then stay like this 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:08.570
 finally we make two platforms of two 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:12.500
 by two with two small blocks like 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:13.160
 this if we break up and another to 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.950
 cap tic 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:18.260
 we can put two pots of red stands 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:20.240
 and we will put our football here with 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.800
 the button another button for you 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:24.430
 here and sailboats that we send a 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:28.460
 pulse the torch site 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:32.000
 so after that we will not go our angers or 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:34.010
 we will put our comparators justice 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.940
 then one two three four blood and gold 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:40.160
 I pretend 1 counting up to 5 for 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:41.870
 the example so we speak they go 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:45.200
 loop then simply 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:49.640
 they will do everything to speak face thereby 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:51.560
 so in two three four five like 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.750
 these and it's going to take them 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:56.120
 go back and forth there to go 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:57.410
 So join this one are we going 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.860
 make is that we will start with 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:05.660
 furrows valmy the first here up that makes 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:09.640
 facing this meal we will put all the 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:15.800
 others who are facing him like this 1 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:17.300
 2 3 4 and do not last will have to 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:19.610
 position for them to face 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:22.250
 his thin skin greenbook simply 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:27.860
 so after if we can put our 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:32.750
 comparators and after that we'll be 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:35.390
 simply put our display so 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:38.000
 here and then only 6 votes for 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:40.640
 childhood simply put our mates out of 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.650
 redstone so who will be powered by 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:44.570
 hangs so we put his first 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:46.280
 row from where just leaves and 

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:49.960
 Then we will put any 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:52.030
 object of a 

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:55.720
 in our machine and we will test see 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:04:02.770
 if it works then we are already in 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:05.080
 think of 2 3 4 5 and the last one our 

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:07.150
 machine initials and so our 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:08.920
 counter is now over he's 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:10.540
 official so you can see and 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:13.360
 functional then what is good 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:14.950
 that are simply sexy we have 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:18.130
 many things counted for example at 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:20.260
 the second and drive of our club on 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:22.180
 can we want to activate machines but 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:24.760
 also at the 4th on vaccinate machine 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:26.860
 not win the juices combine combine 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:29.410
 two storytellers simply with 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:31.330
 russell we can do it what I have 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:34.990
 already seen cons of the models of 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:36.700
 behavior that was really 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:38.620
 example his venom activated at the second 

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:40.680
 times the discomfort of two men have 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:43.450
 wanted activated fourth time the discomfort 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:44.950
 of 4 so stride paired to contemplate 

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:48.090
 with those counting we can all 

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:51.160
 simply we can simply 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:53.230
 to have justin and send a system 

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:55.510
 raid falls to 2 and the map 

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:57.460
 so it can be pretty handy yes 

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:59.710
 also those counting can be used 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:02.290
 like its readers that is to say that we have 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:03.640
 sectors display display with 

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:05.170
 button is clicked essec 

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:07.150
 select a row but all 

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:10.120
 just these same principles includes 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:11.520
 with complying with those just that we have 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:14.650
 a whore 

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:17.170
 compared to posters to display its 

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:19.210
 readers that we have plenty of buttons for 

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:21.550
 select really arranged we want 

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:24.070
 here we just have a goal and we're going 

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:26.110
 simply go from row to row 

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:30.130
 but it can be used as his 

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:32.950
 readers too but really at the base 

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:34.870
 it's a storyteller yes here to send 

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:37.249
 pulses automatically instead 

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:39.379
 to have a little button 

00:05:37.249 --> 00:05:41.539
 put a cigarette with a wooden strain 

00:05:39.379 --> 00:05:44.599
 and without a voice after a certain period of time 

00:05:41.539 --> 00:05:47.089
 time without a voice a pulse and its 

00:05:44.599 --> 00:05:49.149
 accomplice impulse that we will take in 

00:05:47.089 --> 00:05:52.879
 the system and then we can activate 

00:05:49.149 --> 00:05:54.559
 other systems so pressure to 

00:05:52.879 --> 00:05:56.149
 reset a reset button 

00:05:54.559 --> 00:05:56.659
 easily on those counting if that's 

00:05:56.149 --> 00:05:58.369
 necessary 

00:05:56.659 --> 00:05:59.989
 so I'm families because I 

00:05:58.369 --> 00:06:02.539
 think it's not necessary in all 

00:05:59.989 --> 00:06:03.829
 the systems so the tutorial is 

00:06:02.539 --> 00:06:05.659
 finished if you liked it 

00:06:03.829 --> 00:06:07.189
 put a gem subscribe you and me I 

00:06:05.659 --> 00:06:09.939
 tell you next for next 

00:06:07.189 --> 00:06:09.939
 hi videos
