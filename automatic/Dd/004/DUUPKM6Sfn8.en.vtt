00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:07.819
 good night everyone welcome to the 

00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:11.660
 channel of my life this good today we are going to 

00:00:07.819 --> 00:00:14.719
 make a show called song jellyfish and 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:17.600
 it's about making a drink in three layers 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:20.300
 and put a jellyfish in the middle layer 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:22.039
 create the already you will see is a very show 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.740
 fun and that he likes the 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:28.519
 people are going to why they have a 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:29.900
 capacity of 30 of 50 milliliters and that of 

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:32.480
 back is almost double 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:34.220
 you have to calculate the ye 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.960
 amounts depending on the vessels of 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:39.110
 what you have but we go is very easy 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:41.780
 then let's start first 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:46.750
 fill the blue scenery 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:46.750
 we fill it almost half way 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:50.160
 now digs blue 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:58.070
 let's fill one with vodka 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:01:00.610
 we fill it almost whole 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:00.610
 Oh 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:07.320
 now let's fill up halfway 1 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:07.320
 with about 60 or ascend ine 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:17.470
 now let's throw him in another a bit of 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:19.270
 milk do not eat your head with the 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:20.980
 milk this is a skim milk but 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.380
 the normal milk that we use for the 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:26.110
 breakfast for the tail cao do not give him 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:27.640
 returns to milk a normal milk that 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:29.780
 it makes me many to ask what kind of 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:32.450
 milk is a normal milk 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:35.840
 Now what we are going to do is in this 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:37.970
 make the layers a little milk 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:40.820
 what are we going to do to use 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:42.409
 to make the jellyfish and now I'm going I'm going to 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.600
 change the camera to make it look better 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:47.450
 to do the layers well I'm going to put 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:49.729
 a white background to make it look better 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:52.100
 how the layers are made because sometimes 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:54.110
 with the light of the crystals they look very 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.440
 good good the first one we're going to 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.210
 do 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:01.260
 blue is the priest out 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:04.060
 blue to see a little bit back this 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:07.830
 we tip the glass nothing is not there 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:10.770
 no problem we throw it 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:15.810
 we already have a list the color cap 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:18.330
 blue the next one is the vodka here yes 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:20.900
 do it with more cautiously slowly what 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:25.569
 tilts jce 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:25.569
 and we will go forming 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:32.400
 the first layer 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:32.400
 we will have a blue clarito 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:42.270
 so it looks good dances two layers in this 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:45.860
 darker blue and this is almost 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:48.110
 transparent very well 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:51.940
 now we're going for the last layer that 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:51.940
 is the one of settled was not ine 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:56.170
 that will remain yellow 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.050
 You see how it is already forming 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:09.650
 we have already made the three layers 

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:13.189
 is 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:15.049
 blue blue light green and I think that it 

00:03:13.189 --> 00:03:18.620
 they look pretty good and now what are we going to 

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:20.200
 to do is to form a jellyfish in the layer 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:23.110
 medium 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:25.300
 come let's go for them 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:28.570
 another very usual question that you ask me 

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:30.400
 is it can replace the path I 

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:32.980
 I tried to make it with other liquors 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:35.350
 and still there is not discovered by which one 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:37.690
 can replace always stays the 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:39.460
 milk up with the only one that passes and it 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:42.130
 is the middle layer is with the path 

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:43.480
 anyway, if any of you try if 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:47.700
 we discover you can leave it in the 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:47.700
 comments so we take advantage of all 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:54.620
 Now let's take the milk to make 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:57.650
 the medusa look at what you put we take it is more 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:04:00.250
 or less the amount we put it up and 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:00.250
 we let it fall 

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:10.760
 precious today appear 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:10.760
 there you have a jellyfish 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:18.090
 that stays right in the middle or goes away 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:18.090
 the blue furacao 

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:24.720
 nor does he stay in the part above 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:27.030
 it stays right in the middle table and as 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:29.100
 everything comes out very rich music 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:30.480
 I like it now I'm going to teach it from 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:32.380
 up so you can see how the 

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:36.850
 head of the jellyfish 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:38.680
 there you have it that you think is beautiful and 

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:41.260
 very easy to do this does not have any 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:45.030
 secret if you move it a little look 

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:48.240
 how it moves moves the legs you see 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:50.820
 very rich and also very good in a 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:52.530
 come drink will make a decision from 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:54.890
 up so you can see the head of the 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:54.890
 jellyfish 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:01.099
 good job 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:04.819
 with this you are going to look great as 

00:05:01.099 --> 00:05:08.539
 champions or champions is very easy to 

00:05:04.819 --> 00:05:10.849
 do he has nothing is nice can 

00:05:08.539 --> 00:05:14.180
 Well nothing if you liked it you already know 

00:05:10.849 --> 00:05:16.370
 I like to subscribe and 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:21.550
