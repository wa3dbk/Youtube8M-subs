 carolina is certainly nothing 

00:03:52.169 --> 00:03:55.359

 hernandez flowers 

00:03:56.599 --> 00:03:59.599
 but let's see who is the current model 

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:04.939
 already to finalize 

00:04:04.939 --> 00:04:08.569
 your message on this topic about states 

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:12.439
 realities are somehow being 

00:04:12.439 --> 00:04:15.439
 coming and that in fact the ancestors lived 

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:19.090
 what is your message 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:21.449
 what is coming now 

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:23.279
 and there is a better world 

00:04:23.279 --> 00:04:26.279
 I am a trade teacher we are going to have a small 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:30.129
 stage of 

00:04:30.129 --> 00:04:31.389
 because look what 

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:34.779
 no one raises the growth of a last of happiness 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:37.870
 the Russian revolution and the French 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:41.690
 it was not done because people were glad been put in scandinavia and subdued 

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:43.849
 it has been excellent and I think that 

00:04:43.849 --> 00:04:45.320
 in the past 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:46.550
 200 years 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:49.870
 never a crisis so deep social as that dictated by so many shortcomings 

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:52.809
 with so much famine 

00:04:52.809 --> 00:04:55.900
 that I can mention to you, make my country come true at this moment 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:00.570
 cook who can think that Argentina at this moment has 40% of its partner 

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:03.050
 low poverty index 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:04.939
 the barn of the world 

00:05:04.939 --> 00:05:07.029
 for the bad policy of his government 

00:05:07.029 --> 00:05:10.300
 they have put us almost on our knees 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:13.710
 but it matters that they are stage that we have to live 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:17.550
 and it's very rewarding at least for me and I want to convey to you 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:19.039
 friends that do not doubt 

00:05:19.039 --> 00:05:21.669
 when one goes through a painful place 

00:05:21.669 --> 00:05:25.180
 full of petraeus over sacrifice of pain 

00:05:25.889 --> 00:05:27.199
 and look back 

00:05:27.199 --> 00:05:31.520
 and see what happened there feels revalued by ice I could go 

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:33.379
 that crisis situation 

00:05:33.379 --> 00:05:35.879
 the triumph over that 

00:05:35.879 --> 00:05:39.469
 that is the hope that we propose that everyone knows that the 

00:05:39.469 --> 00:05:41.139
 accionante information 

00:05:41.139 --> 00:05:43.129
 they did not want the catastrophism 

00:05:43.129 --> 00:05:45.120
 they did not want messianism 

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:46.930
 believe that we are here 

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:48.389
 I moved nilo 

00:05:48.389 --> 00:05:50.199
 this planet will disappear 

00:05:50.199 --> 00:05:52.139
 we have come to fulfill 

00:05:52.139 --> 00:05:56.439
 with the aim of achieving an evolution as a human race 

00:05:56.439 --> 00:05:59.749
 and we have the ability to achieve it, do not be persuaded 

00:06:00.469 --> 00:06:03.180
 that we do not have that capacity 

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:04.279
 we can 

00:06:04.279 --> 00:06:07.759
 What is needed is that we do not propose it 

00:06:07.759 --> 00:06:11.469
 between all and fundamentally we begin to respect each other 

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:14.999
 let's all stop living in this jungle 

00:06:14.999 --> 00:06:18.659
 Where do I stay? I always tell people if people have 

00:06:20.319 --> 00:06:21.789
 the opportunity 

00:06:21.789 --> 00:06:24.289
 and the decision 

00:06:24.289 --> 00:06:27.569
 in various stages of his life in the years 

00:06:27.569 --> 00:06:30.860
 at a given moment computation 

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:34.770
 contemplates nature see how functional it is also caught 

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:37.680
 it made hot planet with us 

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:41.960
 let's see two things we will recognize with what harmony they work 

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:44.999
 we have to achieve is harmonic 

00:06:44.999 --> 00:06:50.039
 in the coexistence the sentence but another one very very very sad and lamented 

00:06:50.869 --> 00:06:53.949
 in that selection we will try or check 

00:06:53.949 --> 00:06:56.949
 that the only thing that is passing on this planet is us 

00:06:57.949 --> 00:06:59.749
 then let's do it 

00:06:59.749 --> 00:07:02.960
 creditors to this planet that did not arrive thousands of years ago 

00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:06.890
 and share with our brothers plant of our brothers 

00:07:08.059 --> 00:07:09.949
 It has kind of any kind 

00:07:09.949 --> 00:07:13.909
 We were going to make that fraternity that is not going to take away a world 

00:07:13.909 --> 00:07:14.889
 different 

00:07:14.889 --> 00:07:19.300
 I insist the message our hope and I hope so 

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:22.129
 from Monaco in thank you very much for being here 

00:07:22.129 --> 00:07:26.339
 in contacts and p the debate of course is open 

00:07:26.339 --> 00:07:29.879
 that has also opened up all these concerns that we have planted in this 

00:07:29.879 --> 00:07:31.599
 time this program 

00:07:31.599 --> 00:07:34.229
 so that you extension reflect 

00:07:34.229 --> 00:07:36.129
 and those who want to believe create 

00:07:36.129 --> 00:07:38.149
 and who does not also 

00:07:38.149 --> 00:07:40.389

 on the other hand 

00:07:59.779 --> 00:08:02.779
 do not
