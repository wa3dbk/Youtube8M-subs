00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:11.429
 the little new cell that you 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:16.619
 present here is called the breaker minot 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:21.000
 135 mr so we already had the range in 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:23.850
 165 bitter there now we have it in 135th r 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.470
 so at the time that is compressed the 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.790
 peculiarity is that it will not 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.720
 moved a lot of water he will not shoot 

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:30.120
 too much in the can 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:34.200
 on the other hand it will emit a lot 

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:37.200
 bright flash when we go back and 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.180
 to that we associate a bib in the shape of 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.920
 shovel there that will really do it 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.079
 down quickly without that pulls too 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.000
 in the can and who especially goes the 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.010
 maintain at the maximum depth 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.110
 to the boat or up to your 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.170
 feet the two basic animations the 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.610
 first it bothers no one launches it 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.780
 mill more or less calabash in 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.970
 function of the depth of the grille 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.160
 the calabashes there I'm going fishing for two 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:00.390
 meters below the surface brings back continuously 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.630
 more or less quickly one or two 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.189
 accelerations one or two stops all this 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:07.500
 that there is more simple and after if 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.780
 really fish are on the jerk 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.280
 what I could do is the anime 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.710
 more 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:17.010
 so I run I make it flow the good 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.810
 depth and then with my frozen cane 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:20.850
 to animate it either switch these little ones 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.400
 blows like that is contrary to 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.200
 jackass and powerful have not hesitated to 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.490
 take breaks the fish take 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.720
 often on the same poses on the 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.799
 their floating he catches it well so 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.600
 I have a hand for someone who goes back 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.790
 and then I calmly lead 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.860
 it exists since colors in that which 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.500
 I use the fireier tiger 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.510
 really a must red 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.020
 lacquered which is very good in some 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:42.180
 periods 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.560
 the perch which in general in waters 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.869
 clear a little greenish where you 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.430
 referees is very good and the goal of the 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.730
 which remains unavoidable on 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:55.220
 pike to have all the time 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:55.220
 he missed four of the boat and arnould 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:08.220
 a behind 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.220
 fish 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.080
 and
