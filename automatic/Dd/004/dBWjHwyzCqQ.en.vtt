00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:08.370
 hello welcome to the chain of life 

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:11.219
 cooking today are mad about who 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.900
 what to time and spinach then the 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:16.560
 ingredients we need 8 leaves of 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:20.849
 brick of the after mine fresh light a 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:26.880
 egg olive oil milk 1 onion 

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:30.679
 canned tuna spinach salt from 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:34.760
 pepper parsley and garlic base 

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:37.410
 herbs from Provence and chives 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:43.350
 we will prepare the phase so we will 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:01:00.690
 put a spoonful of butter and we're going 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:01:06.090
 and competed and the onion I acted and 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:08.990
 then we will put the spinach 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.990
 250 Roma 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:22.810
 so once the pinault has 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.810
 started to add the tone 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.540
 here 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:46.490
 we came 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:57.750
 and then you can put the 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:02:05.220
 spices so I put some pepper 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:14.540
 large even pc3 binds basil and 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:14.540
 parsley the little dumpling 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:24.170
 and some provincial grass 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:32.520
 and in fact these 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:38.710
 here 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.360
 so I added a little spice 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:46.459
 in the preparation but it's not 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:48.590
 mandatory which once it's a 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:55.780
 little cooked you can add just one 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:55.780
 little bit of is really a drop 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:05.580
 and just a teaspoon of cream 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:05.580
 fresh 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:22.049
 evreux night so we will start at 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:25.049
 folding the hoses is so we will cut 

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:28.459
 the brick sheet in two so that's it 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:32.939
 is me I do them so we learn 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:37.469
 it's very simple we take a little 2 bat 

00:03:32.939 --> 00:03:46.250
 on it we'll just come to the m on 

00:03:37.469 --> 00:03:49.230
 edges of the brick and we 're going placoly 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:51.049
 but that's why you already have 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:56.449
 for this will be simpler 

00:03:51.049 --> 00:04:02.150
 so we take a quantity of force 

00:03:56.449 --> 00:04:06.900
 like that we just put on the brick 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:12.680
 and so suddenly had filled you have 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:12.680
 already a corner must continue 

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:17.070
 here 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:22.550
 so in the end you get a little more 

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:29.509
 his paw 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:35.650
 you put a little two battered and 

00:04:29.509 --> 00:04:35.650
 after you just blow these are 

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:45.050
 so I go back another time so there 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:47.410
 a sheet of brick I'm going to cut it 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:47.410
 in God 

00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:18.389
 so here is still a little beaten on 

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:21.919
 puts on the edges of the brick suits 

00:05:18.389 --> 00:05:21.919
 then glued 

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:40.580
 so there we find the edges we come 

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:42.850
 take the most strength that have been put on 

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:46.430
 the brick 

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:49.250
 so we'll go to folding so you 

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:51.290
 make a first triangle like this in 

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:54.110
 making sure that the dough that the end is 

00:05:51.290 --> 00:06:00.800
 well the parties under the brick come 

00:05:54.110 --> 00:06:02.960
 bend a second time and institutes to 

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:08.270
 the end you get a surplus of pasta 

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:11.410
 so you take a little fire beaten and 

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:14.480
 you just stick 

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:16.390
 so I made the boxes talk 

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:20.480
 so suddenly I went to cooking 

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:23.140
 so for cooking we will use a 

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:23.140
 little olive oil 

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:30.010
 just like that is enough 

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:37.520
 we wait for him to warm up a little 

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:56.240
 so the gemmi includes the boxes in 

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:58.069
 olive oil so you only have to 

00:06:56.240 --> 00:07:02.150
 hardly a strain next and then I 

00:06:58.069 --> 00:07:03.650
 sense that him so here are the boxes are 

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:05.360
 cooked so I made some salad 

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:07.099
 fleet and mozzarella that I 

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:10.360
 add it and suddenly you can 

00:07:07.099 --> 00:07:10.360
 arrange on the salad 

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:34.560
 so that's ready if you liked 

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:36.150
 my video you can subscribe to my 

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:38.990
 bitch and click on I like 

00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:38.990
 Enjoy your meal
