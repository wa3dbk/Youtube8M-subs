they have a very high ornamental value
especially<00:00:50.039> the<00:00:50.489> main<00:00:50.700> plant<00:00:51.059> adam<00:00:51.629> has<00:00:52.440> this

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
especially the main plant adam has this

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:54.639 
especially the main plant adam has this
type<00:00:53.760> of<00:00:53.789> leafs

00:00:54.639 --> 00:00:54.649 
type of leafs

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:58.670 
type of leafs
after<00:00:55.649> the<00:00:55.770> second<00:00:56.190> year<00:00:56.219> so<00:00:57.030> green<00:00:57.539> why<00:00:58.320> and

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
after the second year so green why and

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.779 
after the second year so green why and
afterwards<00:00:59.430> after<00:00:59.850> the<00:00:59.879> right<00:01:00.180> also<00:01:00.570> here

00:01:01.779 --> 00:01:01.789 
afterwards after the right also here

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:04.490 
afterwards after the right also here
reddish<00:01:02.789> color<00:01:03.239> is<00:01:03.539> developing<00:01:04.320> and

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
reddish color is developing and

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.340 
reddish color is developing and
beginning<00:01:04.949> beginning<00:01:05.400> to<00:01:05.820> become<00:01:06.150> bigger<00:01:06.390> so

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
beginning beginning to become bigger so

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:08.899 
beginning beginning to become bigger so
you<00:01:07.380> have<00:01:07.650> all<00:01:07.890> three<00:01:08.280> cores

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
you have all three cores

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:14.719 
you have all three cores
green<00:01:10.189> red<00:01:11.189> and<00:01:11.490> white<00:01:12.180> and<00:01:12.600> also<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.740> female

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
green red and white and also the female

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.730 
green red and white and also the female
plants<00:01:15.240> become<00:01:15.570> this<00:01:15.750> coloration<00:01:16.170> but<00:01:16.560> it's

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
plants become this coloration but it's

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.730 
plants become this coloration but it's
not<00:01:16.920> so<00:01:17.189> intensive<00:01:18.090> like<00:01:18.299> whether<00:01:18.689> male<00:01:19.200> plums

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
not so intensive like whether male plums

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.280 
not so intensive like whether male plums
another<00:01:20.460> advantage<00:01:20.820> normally<00:01:21.750> with<00:01:21.869> Kiwi<00:01:22.259> you

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
another advantage normally with Kiwi you

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.740 
another advantage normally with Kiwi you
have<00:01:22.500> to<00:01:22.650> wait<00:01:22.860> three<00:01:23.430> four<00:01:23.759> five<00:01:24.000> six<00:01:24.299> seven

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
have to wait three four five six seven

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:30.140 
have to wait three four five six seven
years<00:01:25.070> for<00:01:26.450> fruit<00:01:27.450> but<00:01:28.259> with<00:01:28.500> with<00:01:29.159> they<00:01:29.909> they

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
years for fruit but with with they they

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.859 
years for fruit but with with they they
don't<00:01:30.329> even<00:01:30.689> give<00:01:31.530> blooms<00:01:31.979> but<00:01:32.880> with<00:01:33.180> summer

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
don't even give blooms but with summer

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.350 
don't even give blooms but with summer
Kiwi<00:01:34.320> it's<00:01:34.409> much<00:01:34.560> easier<00:01:35.070> so<00:01:35.520> these<00:01:35.729> planting

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
Kiwi it's much easier so these planting

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.179 
Kiwi it's much easier so these planting
here<00:01:36.509> is<00:01:36.570> in<00:01:36.689> second<00:01:37.110> year<00:01:37.259> it<00:01:37.380> was<00:01:37.500> planted<00:01:37.770> in

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
here is in second year it was planted in

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:42.020 
here is in second year it was planted in
summer<00:01:38.869> 2010<00:01:39.869> and<00:01:40.110> I<00:01:40.619> already<00:01:41.070> teach<00:01:41.310> here<00:01:41.610> we

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
summer 2010 and I already teach here we

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.740 
summer 2010 and I already teach here we
have<00:01:42.150> close<00:01:42.740> here<00:01:43.740> for<00:01:43.920> example<00:01:44.420> so<00:01:45.420> we<00:01:45.570> will

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
have close here for example so we will

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.719 
have close here for example so we will
have<00:01:45.930> the<00:01:46.079> first<00:01:46.259> freed<00:01:46.560> fruit<00:01:46.920> this<00:01:47.250> year<00:01:47.549> and

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
have the first freed fruit this year and

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.230 
have the first freed fruit this year and
for<00:01:48.329> sure<00:01:48.600> next<00:01:49.259> year<00:01:49.560> so<00:01:50.189> fruit<00:01:50.939> peelings

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
for sure next year so fruit peelings

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.780 
for sure next year so fruit peelings
begins<00:01:52.170> much<00:01:52.470> much<00:01:52.740> earlier<00:01:52.979> than<00:01:53.369> with

here<00:02:41.239> the<00:02:41.390> female<00:02:41.720> plant<00:02:41.989> you<00:02:42.440> can<00:02:42.709> make<00:02:43.280> a

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 
here the female plant you can make a

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.229 
here the female plant you can make a
novel<00:02:44.269> stick<00:02:44.480> here<00:02:44.750> to<00:02:45.620> make<00:02:46.459> a<00:02:46.489> bridge<00:02:46.880> and
