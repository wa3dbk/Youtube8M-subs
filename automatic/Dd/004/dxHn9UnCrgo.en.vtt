00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:49.270 
so easy to use in it and it works so

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:52.110

well<00:00:49.300> it's<00:00:49.780> lightweight<00:00:50.079> and<00:00:50.470> it's<00:00:51.400> clean<00:00:51.790> so

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:52.120 
well it's lightweight and it's clean so

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.569 
well it's lightweight and it's clean so
well<00:00:52.329> it's<00:00:52.960> got<00:00:53.170> so<00:00:53.380> much<00:00:53.500> power<00:00:53.770> I<00:00:53.950> think<00:00:54.370> it

00:00:54.569 --> 00:00:54.579 
well it's got so much power I think it

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:56.330 
well it's got so much power I think it
would<00:00:54.700> suck<00:00:55.060> up<00:00:55.210> a<00:00:55.270> bowling<00:00:55.600> ball
