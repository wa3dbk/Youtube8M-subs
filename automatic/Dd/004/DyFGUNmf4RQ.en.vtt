uploading<00:02:12.390> him<00:02:12.569> on

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
uploading him on

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.260 
uploading him on
you<00:02:13.410> know<00:02:13.530> like<00:02:13.950> how<00:02:14.400> we<00:02:14.460> upload<00:02:14.819> videos<00:02:15.150> on

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:22.970 
because you know some people might be
interested<00:02:21.480> in<00:02:21.630> pictures<00:02:21.990> because<00:02:22.500> you<00:02:22.830> know

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
interested in pictures because you know
