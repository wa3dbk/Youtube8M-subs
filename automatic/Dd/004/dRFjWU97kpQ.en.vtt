00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:07.410
 hello I am signed you are in my 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:09.929
 lab and I'm going to show you 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.910
 today how to prepare 12 capes 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.099
 that ex vanilla that is really the 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.020
 cac is the most classic is basic 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.600
 somewhere we will start then to 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.490
 beat the butter the sugar together so 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.470
 to have an extremely kremlin mix 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.630
 do not be afraid to beat 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.490
 long time even if you think you 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.029
 have beaten enough and must continue 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.029
 still a little bit 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.739
 I will start to mix the butter 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.160
 and the sugar and then I will add 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.160
 the 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:57.850
 now that the first is good 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.850
 strong poret I added the second 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.120
 and below 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.710
 when we have a mixture that is good 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.420
 homogeneous and mix well together we go 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.569
 add flour with yeast 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.569
 chemical 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:30.540
 yes that's all I get better than she 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.870
 is today with a pocket and a 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.000
 socket 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:35.910
 but you can of course 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:38.190
 use small spoons or a 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:42.990
 ice cream scoop to fill your 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:43.860
 boxes if you do not have the 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.020
 liquid vanilla 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.270
 you can also use a half 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.080
 vanilla bean or vanilla in 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.310
 powder 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.250
 if you use powdered vanilla 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:59.100
 you buy it with flour and not 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:02:00.990
 after the tests now makes us 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.660
 are ready to provide capitals with 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:06.090
 200 degrees for 11 minutes ambient and 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:08.759
 here are our vanilla cupcakes are 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.649
 out of the oven there is only waiting 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:14.280
 they cool before ice cream 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:16.590
 and I will decorate but cupcakes to breakage 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.390
 hazelnut with hazelnuts 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:24.450
 like the one I used to 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:27.570
 inside the cakes and that's my 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:30.930
 features of the cases, therefore, with aix Nutcracker 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:33.780
 are finished cake with stuffed hazelnut 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:36.000
