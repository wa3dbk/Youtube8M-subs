00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
make as little sense as ours but there's

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.130 
make as little sense as ours but there's
a<00:00:26.340> lot<00:00:26.550> that<00:00:26.789> you<00:00:26.970> have<00:00:27.119> to<00:00:27.269> go<00:00:27.390> back<00:00:27.630> to<00:00:27.900> either

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
a lot that you have to go back to either

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.859 
a lot that you have to go back to either
medieval<00:00:28.980> Europe<00:00:29.369> or<00:00:29.550> even<00:00:29.580> to<00:00:30.090> Roman<00:00:30.570> times

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
medieval Europe or even to Roman times

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.479 
medieval Europe or even to Roman times
to<00:00:31.140> understand<00:00:31.560> why<00:00:31.679> it<00:00:31.740> is<00:00:31.920> that<00:00:31.949> we<00:00:32.130> do<00:00:32.279> the

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
to understand why it is that we do the

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.400 
to understand why it is that we do the
things<00:00:32.700> that<00:00:32.940> we<00:00:33.059> do<00:00:33.300> the<00:00:33.510> first<00:00:34.079> one<00:00:34.260> that<00:00:34.350> I

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
things that we do the first one that I

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.200 
things that we do the first one that I
want<00:00:34.590> to<00:00:34.649> talk<00:00:34.800> about<00:00:34.920> is<00:00:35.190> the<00:00:35.460> throwing<00:00:35.969> of

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
want to talk about is the throwing of

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.750 
want to talk about is the throwing of
the<00:00:36.570> Garter<00:00:37.079> at<00:00:37.320> some<00:00:38.040> point<00:00:38.309> during<00:00:38.520> the

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
the Garter at some point during the

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.209 
the Garter at some point during the
reception<00:00:39.059> which<00:00:39.450> if<00:00:39.989> an<00:00:40.350> alien<00:00:40.530> was<00:00:40.920> to<00:00:41.100> watch

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
reception which if an alien was to watch

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:42.619 
reception which if an alien was to watch
it<00:00:41.430> wouldn't<00:00:41.670> make<00:00:41.730> a<00:00:41.790> lot<00:00:41.879> of<00:00:42.030> sense<00:00:42.270> but<00:00:42.540> the

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
it wouldn't make a lot of sense but the

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.139 
it wouldn't make a lot of sense but the
idea<00:00:42.930> there<00:00:42.989> was<00:00:43.440> it<00:00:43.770> was<00:00:44.040> very<00:00:44.370> important<00:00:45.000> to

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
idea there was it was very important to

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.479 
idea there was it was very important to
prove<00:00:45.539> that<00:00:46.140> a<00:00:46.200> wet<00:00:46.649> of<00:00:46.800> Etta<00:00:46.980> marriage<00:00:47.340> had

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
prove that a wet of Etta marriage had

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.850 
prove that a wet of Etta marriage had
been<00:00:47.520> consummated<00:00:48.210> and<00:00:48.629> so<00:00:48.809> a<00:00:48.840> long<00:00:49.230> long<00:00:49.559> time

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
been consummated and so a long long time

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.400 
been consummated and so a long long time
ago<00:00:50.129> that<00:00:50.280> means<00:00:50.579> exactly<00:00:51.180> that<00:00:51.780> should<00:00:52.050> hump

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
ago that means exactly that should hump

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.619 
ago that means exactly that should hump
and<00:00:52.710> so<00:00:53.579> what<00:00:53.789> they<00:00:53.910> did<00:00:53.969> was<00:00:54.239> they<00:00:54.360> would<00:00:54.480> have

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
and so what they did was they would have

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.220 
and so what they did was they would have
actual<00:00:54.989> witnesses<00:00:55.559> go<00:00:55.920> in<00:00:56.250> and<00:00:56.699> witness<00:00:57.539> the

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
actual witnesses go in and witness the

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.500 
actual witnesses go in and witness the
consummation<00:00:59.039> and<00:00:59.489> sometimes<00:01:00.000> to<00:01:00.180> prove<00:01:00.390> that

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
consummation and sometimes to prove that

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:01.970 
consummation and sometimes to prove that
they<00:01:00.629> had<00:01:00.719> been<00:01:00.840> in<00:01:00.960> there<00:01:01.109> they<00:01:01.530> would<00:01:01.710> rip

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
they had been in there they would rip

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.100 
they had been in there they would rip
off<00:01:02.190> parts<00:01:02.699> of<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.210> woman's<00:01:03.510> dress<00:01:03.809> or<00:01:04.080> the

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
off parts of the woman's dress or the

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.990 
off parts of the woman's dress or the
woman's<00:01:04.470> underwear<00:01:04.920> they<00:01:05.580> would<00:01:05.729> even<00:01:05.820> do

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
woman's underwear they would even do

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.310 
woman's underwear they would even do
that<00:01:06.090> possibly<00:01:06.450> before<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:06.960> consummation

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
that possibly before the consummation

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.810 
that possibly before the consummation
they<00:01:07.530> would<00:01:07.710> strip<00:01:07.920> her<00:01:08.070> down<00:01:08.250> to<00:01:08.400> make<00:01:08.610> sure

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
they would strip her down to make sure

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.429 
they would strip her down to make sure
this<00:01:08.970> is<00:01:09.150> going<00:01:09.299> to<00:01:09.390> happen<00:01:09.570> and<00:01:09.960> it<00:01:10.320> was

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
this is going to happen and it was

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:11.960 
this is going to happen and it was
considered<00:01:10.770> eventually<00:01:11.280> that's<00:01:11.490> a<00:01:11.580> lot<00:01:11.729> like

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
considered eventually that's a lot like

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.429 
considered eventually that's a lot like
that<00:01:12.000> scene<00:01:12.390> in<00:01:12.420> Game<00:01:12.659> of<00:01:12.689> Thrones<00:01:12.810> it's<00:01:13.200> very

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
that scene in Game of Thrones it's very

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.080 
that scene in Game of Thrones it's very
much<00:01:13.650> like<00:01:13.680> I<00:01:13.860> actually<00:01:14.159> like<00:01:14.340> that<00:01:14.670> tradition

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
much like I actually like that tradition

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.880 
much like I actually like that tradition
but<00:01:15.540> they<00:01:15.630> do<00:01:15.689> it<00:01:15.869> in<00:01:16.140> that<00:01:16.350> they<00:01:16.500> do<00:01:16.560> it<00:01:16.710> to<00:01:16.799> the

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
but they do it in that they do it to the

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.770 
but they do it in that they do it to the
man<00:01:17.009> and<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:17.310> woman<00:01:17.430> in<00:01:17.729> Game<00:01:18.210> of<00:01:18.240> Thrones<00:01:18.360> and

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
man and the woman in Game of Thrones and

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.210 
man and the woman in Game of Thrones and
so<00:01:19.229> it<00:01:19.290> was<00:01:19.380> considered<00:01:19.710> good<00:01:19.740> luck<00:01:19.860> to<00:01:20.070> have<00:01:20.189> a

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
so it was considered good luck to have a

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.249 
so it was considered good luck to have a
piece<00:01:20.490> of<00:01:20.520> it<00:01:20.880> so<00:01:21.090> eventually<00:01:21.840> because<00:01:22.110> they

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
piece of it so eventually because they

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.800 
piece of it so eventually because they
just<00:01:22.500> watched<00:01:22.740> the<00:01:23.100> consummation<00:01:23.670> yes<00:01:24.210> that

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
just watched the consummation yes that

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.020 
just watched the consummation yes that
might<00:01:24.960> be<00:01:25.080> apocryphal<00:01:25.350> it<00:01:25.860> is<00:01:26.009> also<00:01:26.820> in<00:01:26.880> this

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
might be apocryphal it is also in this

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.460 
might be apocryphal it is also in this
video<00:01:27.210> covering<00:01:27.810> the<00:01:27.900> origins<00:01:28.350> of

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
video covering the origins of

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.370 
video covering the origins of
pornography<00:01:29.310> mmm<00:01:29.880> it'll<00:01:30.270> be<00:01:30.390> a<00:01:30.420> -<00:01:30.750> it<00:01:31.020> was<00:01:31.229> all

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
pornography mmm it'll be a - it was all

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.410 
pornography mmm it'll be a - it was all
wrong<00:01:31.560> where<00:01:31.740> me<00:01:32.040> and<00:01:32.369> so<00:01:32.700> eventually<00:01:32.939> you

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
wrong where me and so eventually you

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.660 
wrong where me and so eventually you
don't<00:01:33.600> want<00:01:33.840> to<00:01:34.049> lose<00:01:34.290> the<00:01:34.710> dress<00:01:35.009> and<00:01:35.369> maybe
