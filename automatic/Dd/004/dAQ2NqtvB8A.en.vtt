 32 gigabytes with internal storage 

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:58.650
 Our synthetic benchmarks smartphone is not 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.490
 showed an incredibly high level 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:01.710
 performance 

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:03.240
 we believe that the low level is associated with 

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:05.760
 dampness software 

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:07.470
 engineering sample so the model 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.670
 which will go on sale will be much 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:10.590
 faster and more powerful 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:12.930
 nonetheless performance level 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:15.630
 enough for the interface and 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:17.880
 web pages do not hang up but games and movies 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:20.910

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:38.009
 3224 pixel camera interface is simple and 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:40.319

 iso and white balance settings 

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:53.789
 The pictures are very high quality and with a lot of 

00:04:51.569 --> 00:04:55.560
 of the details they differ in remarkable 

00:04:53.789 --> 00:04:56.250
 color reproduction a minimum of noise and 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:58.439
 artifacts 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:00.090
 It is worth noting that the smartphone is excellent 

00:04:58.439 --> 00:05:02.190
 copes with panoramic shooting a 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:05.069

 Full glasses and opportunity 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:11.400
 increase the dynamic range 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:12.960
 video quality is not enough 

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:15.180
 high level and stabilizer 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:17.400
 images help get rid of

 wifi direct 

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:31.199
 there is also a microusb connector 

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:32.900
 and a connector of 3 5 millimeters for

 3000 milliamps per hour 

00:05:36.719 --> 00:05:41.129
 provides good autonomy 

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:42.090
 work given voracious 5-inch

 smartphone modules worked all day 

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:59.339
 so that not very large load 

00:05:56.669 --> 00:05:59.789
 ascend d2 can last a half to two 

00:05:59.339 --> 00:06:01.529
 of the day 

00:05:59.789 --> 00:06:05.000
 besides this there is an opportunity 

00:06:01.529 --> 00:06:05.000
