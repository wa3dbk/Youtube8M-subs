00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
throwing money away but you could just

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.850 
throwing money away but you could just
use<00:01:35.729> some<00:01:35.939> sugar<00:01:36.450> or<00:01:36.840> some<00:01:37.140> salt<00:01:37.409> anything

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.249 
hair grow and be healthy and also add
some<00:01:54.720> shine<00:01:55.020> and<00:01:55.909> to<00:01:56.909> just<00:01:57.119> give<00:01:57.360> the<00:01:57.719> scrub<00:01:58.079> a

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
some shine and to just give the scrub a

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.069 
some shine and to just give the scrub a
little<00:01:58.409> bit<00:01:58.680> of<00:01:58.799> slip<00:01:59.329> so<00:02:00.329> this<00:02:00.630> way<00:02:00.810> you<00:02:00.899> don't

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
little bit of slip so this way you don't

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:02.749 
little bit of slip so this way you don't
feel<00:02:01.290> like<00:02:01.439> you're<00:02:01.590> just<00:02:01.860> having<00:02:02.340> the<00:02:02.490> scrub

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
feel like you're just having the scrub

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.340 
feel like you're just having the scrub
just<00:02:03.030> in<00:02:03.180> one<00:02:03.390> area<00:02:03.719> I<00:02:04.170> just<00:02:04.530> add

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:05.350 
just in one area I just add

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:07.620 
just in one area I just add
shampoo<00:02:05.830> and<00:02:06.100> these<00:02:06.520> guys<00:02:06.700> from<00:02:07.000> wash<00:02:07.270> it's

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.630 
shampoo and these guys from wash it's

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:10.350 
shampoo and these guys from wash it's
the<00:02:07.840> Fairtrade<00:02:08.320> honey<00:02:08.619> shampoo<00:02:09.220> and<00:02:09.490> I<00:02:10.090> really

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
the Fairtrade honey shampoo and I really

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.180 
the Fairtrade honey shampoo and I really
like<00:02:10.539> this<00:02:10.750> one<00:02:10.990> it's<00:02:11.290> preservative<00:02:11.980> free

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 
like this one it's preservative free

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:13.770 
like this one it's preservative free
because<00:02:12.550> honey<00:02:12.850> is<00:02:13.030> a<00:02:13.060> natural<00:02:13.570> preservative

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
because honey is a natural preservative

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.560 
because honey is a natural preservative
and<00:02:14.560> it's<00:02:14.950> also<00:02:15.070> really<00:02:15.190> hydrating<00:02:16.180> for<00:02:16.480> the

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:19.620 
and it's also really hydrating for the
honey<00:02:16.840> and<00:02:17.140> it's<00:02:17.860> just<00:02:18.010> gonna<00:02:18.220> help<00:02:18.910> the<00:02:19.240> scrub

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630
