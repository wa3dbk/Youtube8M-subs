00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
wasn't feeling in the mood to pull up

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.540 
wasn't feeling in the mood to pull up
content<00:02:24.420> I<00:02:24.660> know<00:02:25.260> that<00:02:25.590> sounds<00:02:25.920> annoying<00:02:26.130> but

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
content I know that sounds annoying but

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.990 
content I know that sounds annoying but
that<00:02:27.150> was<00:02:27.330> the<00:02:27.450> case<00:02:27.630> so<00:02:28.470> I<00:02:28.860> am<00:02:29.460> going<00:02:29.670> to<00:02:29.820> do<00:02:29.970> my

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
that was the case so I am going to do my

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.810 
that was the case so I am going to do my
best<00:02:30.450> to<00:02:30.690> get<00:02:30.840> things<00:02:31.140> back<00:02:31.410> together<00:02:31.650> and<00:02:32.070> I

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
best to get things back together and I

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
think my content is kind of a similar to

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.060 
think my content is kind of a similar to
