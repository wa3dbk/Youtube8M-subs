00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:56.700 

00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:12.150 

let's<00:04:57.700> take<00:04:57.970> this<00:05:03.600> united<00:05:04.600> kingdom<00:05:11.160> i'm

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:12.160 
let's take this united kingdom i'm

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:14.510 
let's take this united kingdom i'm
looking<00:05:12.460> forward<00:05:12.670> to<00:05:12.880> seeing<00:05:13.380> these

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:14.520 
looking forward to seeing these

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:18.060 
looking forward to seeing these
capacitive<00:05:15.520> buttons<00:05:16.350> and<00:05:17.350> how<00:05:17.500> they<00:05:17.740> light<00:05:18.040> up

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:18.070 
capacitive buttons and how they light up

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:21.470 
capacitive buttons and how they light up
an<00:05:18.700> overall-experience<00:05:19.560> battery<00:05:20.560> life<00:05:20.770> and

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:21.480 
an overall-experience battery life and

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:27.560 
an overall-experience battery life and
performance<00:05:22.480> and<00:05:25.350> taking<00:05:26.350> this<00:05:26.500> back<00:05:26.830> off<00:05:27.130> I

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:27.570 
performance and taking this back off I

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:30.150 
performance and taking this back off I
think<00:05:28.570> should<00:05:28.810> be<00:05:29.020> fairly<00:05:29.200> easy<00:05:29.410> but<00:05:29.860> I'm<00:05:29.980> not

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:30.160 
think should be fairly easy but I'm not

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:33.390 
think should be fairly easy but I'm not
going<00:05:30.400> to<00:05:30.520> take<00:05:30.670> this<00:05:30.880> back<00:05:31.270> up<00:05:31.540> off<00:05:32.070> until<00:05:33.070> I<00:05:33.250> k

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:33.400 
going to take this back up off until I k

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:36.540 
going to take this back up off until I k
another<00:05:33.910> replacement<00:05:34.300> and<00:05:34.920> so<00:05:35.920> I'm<00:05:36.010> just

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:36.550 
another replacement and so I'm just

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:39.030 
another replacement and so I'm just
going<00:05:36.670> to<00:05:36.730> set<00:05:36.940> this<00:05:37.090> up<00:05:37.150> and<00:05:37.660> see<00:05:38.320> how<00:05:38.590> it

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:39.040 
going to set this up and see how it

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:40.530 
going to set this up and see how it
performs<00:05:39.370> in<00:05:39.670> there<00:05:39.820> another<00:05:40.060> video<00:05:40.390> I'll

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:40.540 
performs in there another video I'll

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:44.700 
performs in there another video I'll
give<00:05:40.780> a<00:05:40.930> at<00:05:41.590> in<00:05:42.310> depth<00:05:42.550> review<00:05:43.120> and<00:05:43.620> some<00:05:44.620> of
