00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:05.100
 hello and welcome to the new 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.230
 video apple like after the apple world 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.750
 We now let's see us the new macbook 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:12.269
 and the water that already is simpler 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.040
 Maybe it will be too simplistic 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:23.010
 you will experience it after the intro 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:24.449
 I have a lot of fun now we are 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.910
 from the apple keynote get out of this 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.710
 spring cinema the us next to some 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.720
 also the apple watch 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.669
 and now that too 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.320
 new macbook air is almost the same 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.360
 successor of macbook air 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.399
 it is much simpler in both of them 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.800
 work easier as it looks exactly 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.770
 look at us now as mentioned 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.170
 thin overall 24 percent thinner than 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.780
 the macbook air that he falls into this 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.539
 fall away it is easier under one 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:54.149
 kilo and has a 12 inch retina display 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:56.579
 we are always on apple.com 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.440
 to read exciting it apple goes 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.000
 this way of the iphones we very much 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.670
 she was only three successful 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.500
 colors in addition to the previous model 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.450
 aluminum you now have two 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.060
 more all models in colors space 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.070
 gray and gold in my opinion looks 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.200
 The gold took some getting used to 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.820
 emmaus even if apple's very special 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.860
 feature everywhere you can 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.090
 I'm curious how the men effect 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.420
 the distribution looks in any case 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:23.240
 on 03 new models especially one 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.560
 special they have a lot of one 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.000
 input devices made on the one hand at the 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.130
 keyboard that has always been very much 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.310
 good you have the keys now 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.259
 function quasi rebuilt so the 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.210
 buttons react even better and not 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.950
 so easy to wiggle when you are 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.600
 on it presses until 19 o'clock an edge 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.729
 get caught but I express myself 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.979
 Overall, these are in general 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:46.439
 a lot thinner because of course 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.479
 in the south housing owed but by 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:51.600
 this new keyboard and re-key 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:54.479
 Technique so that typing is even better and yes 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.829
 he feels better in the end 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.270
 also new and it's a big one 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:59.009
 The apple not only new in the new 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.740
 macbooks then synonymous in the new macbook pro 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:04.140
 what has been updated has been introduced 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.869
 a new trackpad bc new technology 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.099
 behind it is called forest has that 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:10.229
 means you do not just get one 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:12.000
 feedback if you press or if yours 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.130
 things happen but could now on 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.870
 all 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:17.150
 egbert type and everywhere the same 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:18.830
 feeling like you would like the key below 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.790
 click on the lower right corner as it used to 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:22.550
 have known 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:25.520
 that means that a lot is done and 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:27.680
 why forest touch so that means apple that 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:29.600
 her if you between her there are light ones 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.730
 So far you know there are feasts 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.140
 press and there is now that right 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:34.730
 Firm press that recognizes this 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:36.640
 trackpad comparatively like to 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:39.290
 example also on iphone ipad or 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:41.000
 general devices and so could 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:43.340
 activate completely different functions like 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.650
 for example, in the browser on board directly 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:48.440
 to open a dixi you can join 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:50.240
 mail adress e-mail in if you have one 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.650
 date with an address and looks in place 

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:54.350
 he does it automatically 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:57.170
 calendar entry and by additional function 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:03:00.940
 could now touch directly with this fund 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:03.080
 or like apple in forest touch feature 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:04.610
 implement and so maybe a few things 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:05.440
 faster and easier to use and 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:08.750
 to reach 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:11.090
 that could be fundamental to that 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:13.220
 we have changed only one thing remains inside 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:19.370
 with a resolution of my knowledge 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:21.680
 after 2003 104 x 1440 pixels far 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:24.320
 greater than full hd very high resolution 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.770
 for a 12 inch display like we have it 

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:28.100
 know 

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:31.400
 and yes that's so basic the hard 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:32.780
 facts about the new mac pros question is 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.400
 maybe it's that small it's too big 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:36.200
 eppler is a matter of opinion he has to 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.820
 Imagine this size of this 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.980
 display moves exactly between the 

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:42.140
 11 inch model and the 13 inch model 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:43.820
 I was the 11 inch model of the macbook 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:45.590
 air been a bit too small 

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:47.180
 how it looks with the twelfth modern 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:48.590
 I really do not have to 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:52.220
 take a look and try it out 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:54.860
 it sets out with and so we come times 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:57.290
 to send this beautiful new price 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:58.670
 partially shapes price comes very short 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:00.950
 provided only for the connection 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:02.690
 that's out of the thing was his greatest 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:04.870
 Criticisms because he would have me 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:07.310
 Imagine this macbook has two more 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:09.590
 connections once for headphones so 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:11.900
 normal jack connection and then one 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:12.620
 connection for yourself what can this one 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:15.260
 his connection 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:17.060
 he is almost all the rest to 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:19.420
 a to recharge use this 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:22.490
 connection, however, is also a 

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:24.110
 usb-port the new board over the 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:25.639
 industry away 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:27.919
 has found that this 

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:30.229
 new board becomes the standard around this 

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:31.939
 Pot you can pretty much via adapter 

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:34.930
 many more connections afterwards 

00:04:31.939 --> 00:04:37.840
 start from usb mini displayport vga 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:40.189
 hdmi etc 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:43.039
 that means you can quasi 

00:04:40.189 --> 00:04:44.449
 just connect an input device 

00:04:43.039 --> 00:04:46.250
 that means if you have a display 

00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:47.479
 you can not have any other 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:49.280
 Devices can be connected again 

00:04:47.479 --> 00:04:50.030
 Charge still in the usb stick 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:52.909
 plug in 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:54.650
 also an external hard drive is so with 

00:04:52.909 --> 00:04:56.750
 This one connection blocks it 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:59.330
 can not have another display et cetera 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:00.889
 connect is definitely a 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:02.960
 Stepped the apple with many devices 

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:04.370
 make him tenth and how 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:06.439
 she is also in this winter 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:08.360
 not much longer I still finds 

00:05:06.439 --> 00:05:09.560
 pity because people special 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:10.969
 at least one two connections 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:13.219
 I regularly use them too 

00:05:10.969 --> 00:05:15.199
 also with the macbook air is still one 

00:05:13.219 --> 00:05:17.419
 further step back to a single one 

00:05:15.199 --> 00:05:19.520
 connection really hard to throwback 

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:21.889
 then very exciting and interesting 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:24.289
 Apple has attracted the processor 

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:26.990
 Motherboard completely shrunken down 

00:05:24.289 --> 00:05:30.110
 she adorns the only thing about computers 

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:32.330
 chips remain a complete rest 

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:34.159
 is quasi with battery added and this 

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:35.779
 chord the special property of 

00:05:34.159 --> 00:05:37.729
 even to the housing to that something 

00:05:35.779 --> 00:05:39.289
 Rounded housing again adapted 

00:05:37.729 --> 00:05:41.930
 different stages that is called apple 

00:05:39.289 --> 00:05:43.909
 would like the best possible battery life 

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:45.830
 get out and in the end it is 

00:05:43.909 --> 00:05:47.569
 acceptable but you can not do that much 

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:50.629
 better nine hours to nine hours 

00:05:47.569 --> 00:05:52.339
 This battery is very good 

00:05:50.629 --> 00:05:54.379
 obviously for a laptop because apple 

00:05:52.339 --> 00:05:56.960
 This information also holds 

00:05:54.379 --> 00:05:58.490
 not unbelievably good and unbelievable 

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:01.250
 better than other apple devices or 

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:02.839
 other macbooks the baseline to 

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:05.779
 macbook finally welcome it 

00:06:02.839 --> 00:06:07.279
 Price is unfortunately the same way 

00:06:05.779 --> 00:06:10.120
 as cheap as it used to be from macbook 

00:06:07.279 --> 00:06:13.009
 recognized this macbook launches 

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:17.029
 $ 1,299 to one 

00:06:13.009 --> 00:06:19.849
 larger model of up to 1000 599 us 

00:06:17.029 --> 00:06:23.360
 dollar salary normal configurations 

00:06:19.849 --> 00:06:26.659
 such as a 512 gb ssd 1,2 

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:28.460
 gigahertz dualcore a good graphics card 

00:06:26.659 --> 00:06:30.469
 so akw could always be exactly on 

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:32.839
 read apple.com and in the end 

00:06:30.469 --> 00:06:34.550
 but say it is not this below 

00:06:32.839 --> 00:06:36.080
 professional calculator on what you 

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:37.970
 probably photo spread videos 

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:42.199
 should be able to run it in parallel 

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:43.970
 is a good solid laptop in the stable 

00:06:42.199 --> 00:06:45.860
 general good mood can write 

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:47.949
 Surfing well could work well 

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:49.759
 but it is not graphic for me here 

00:06:47.949 --> 00:06:50.360
 exhausting work rather less 

00:06:49.759 --> 00:06:53.330
 suitable 

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:54.860
 that is what I am fundamentally about 

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:57.199
 incredibly curious to your opinion 

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:58.849
 about this macbook that you wanted 

00:06:57.199 --> 00:06:59.360
 buy it why do not you want to 

00:06:58.849 --> 00:07:01.219
 to buy 

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:04.009
 finds her it well these steps to 

00:07:01.219 --> 00:07:06.110
 a simple simple and macbook what 

00:07:04.009 --> 00:07:07.849
 very thin is little connections or 

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:09.650
 delhi at macbook which is a bit thicker 

00:07:07.849 --> 00:07:11.569
 but more up to date for more connections 

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:12.229
 Write me the comments very much 

00:07:11.569 --> 00:07:13.639
 interest 

00:07:12.229 --> 00:07:15.530
 I was definitely the apple 

00:07:13.639 --> 00:07:17.150
 live.com downloads her maps 

00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:19.250
 I organize have or will fan on 

00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:21.080
 facebook or twitter follower and already 

00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:23.629
 like to go back to apple live.com 

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:26.509
 more news more videos and more 

00:07:23.629 --> 00:07:28.310
 report on this apple cinema that what 

00:07:26.509 --> 00:07:28.849
 in this video I am happy 

00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:30.529
 look at 

00:07:28.849 --> 00:07:33.520
 Many thanks for watching we want 

00:07:30.529 --> 00:07:33.520
 See you next time
