00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
now I just think that opportunity that's

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.039 
now I just think that opportunity that's
in<00:02:34.019> front<00:02:34.140> of<00:02:34.290> you<00:02:35.209> about<00:02:36.209> doing<00:02:36.480> a<00:02:36.629> workup<00:02:36.900> do

00:02:37.039 --> 00:02:37.049 
in front of you about doing a workup do

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:40.190

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
they want to work you out I think they

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.650 
they want to work you out I think they
would<00:02:40.410> like<00:02:40.680> to<00:02:40.860> working<00:02:41.160> out<00:02:41.370> but<00:02:42.329> we<00:02:42.480> didn't

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
would like to working out but we didn't

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.520 
would like to working out but we didn't
really<00:02:42.780> talk<00:02:42.989> about<00:02:43.049> workouts<00:02:45.019> and<00:02:46.019> I<00:02:46.140> didn't

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
really talk about workouts and I didn't

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.259 
really talk about workouts and I didn't
they<00:02:46.650> didn't<00:02:46.950> I<00:02:47.129> don't<00:02:47.400> think<00:02:47.579> they<00:02:47.640> contacted

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:48.269 
they didn't I don't think they contacted

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:50.270 
they didn't I don't think they contacted
you<00:02:48.450> know<00:02:48.569> contacted<00:02:49.560> me<00:02:49.650> to<00:02:49.739> come<00:02:49.920> in<00:02:50.040> for<00:02:50.220> a

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
you know contacted me to come in for a

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:51.650 
you know contacted me to come in for a
workout<00:02:50.579> but<00:02:50.849> I'm<00:02:51.060> sure<00:02:51.239> they<00:02:51.450> would<00:02:51.629> have

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
workout but I'm sure they would have

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.800 
workout but I'm sure they would have
liked<00:02:52.549> they<00:02:53.549> say<00:02:53.760> well<00:02:54.120> they<00:02:54.329> say<00:02:54.540> that<00:02:54.690> they

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
liked they say well they say that they

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:58.400 
liked they say well they say that they
got<00:02:55.230> a<00:02:55.260> chance<00:02:55.349> to<00:02:55.650> see<00:02:55.829> me<00:02:55.950> all<00:02:56.099> year<00:02:56.489> I<00:02:57.410> think

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
got a chance to see me all year I think

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:59.720 
got a chance to see me all year I think
that<00:02:58.530> was<00:02:58.680> probably<00:02:58.829> one<00:02:59.250> of<00:02:59.280> the<00:02:59.400> big<00:02:59.549> reasons

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
that was probably one of the big reasons

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.800 
that was probably one of the big reasons
why<00:02:59.970> I<00:03:00.060> did<00:03:01.849> you<00:03:02.849> already<00:03:03.060> have<00:03:03.299> point<00:03:03.599> guards

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
why I did you already have point guards

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:04.729 
why I did you already have point guards
I<00:03:03.870> know<00:03:03.930> it<00:03:04.109> wasn't<00:03:04.260> something<00:03:04.410> you<00:03:04.560> had<00:03:04.680> to

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
deal with but the preparation you made

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:07.670 
deal with but the preparation you made
to<00:03:06.599> maybe<00:03:06.780> compete<00:03:07.139> with<00:03:07.230> Darius<00:03:07.500> Morris
