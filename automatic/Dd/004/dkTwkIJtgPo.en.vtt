00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:05.250
 different seasons grips 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:07.440
 there probably not least, there are 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:11.300
 with this murder spring and all 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.300
 other seasons have fun 

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:25.610
 so first I show you the autumn 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.520
 that is probably one of the best wind 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:30.980
 seasons of this model because you see 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:32.989
 The world will simply change it 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:35.750
 just looks really cool that 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:38.570
 everything so brown leaves gets everywhere 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:41.180
 i am here in a forest bio it is 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:42.379
 not here in a scorpion but now 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:44.300
 that's not so bad either 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:48.860
 Here we see again the transition the 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:52.850
 then everything is so orange worthy again 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:55.309
 if that's really cool and it will be new 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:59.059
 added plant that you can see 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:01:01.879
 Those are the ones that fit here 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:05.299
 implants if I just now the 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:06.770
 Hesse simple flower and this is the 

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:09.920
 Winter might look really cool and 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:12.439
 he is even texture pack compatible like 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.159
 you can see it works, he too 

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:14.869
 itself may not be the best 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:17.630
 texture pack to show that 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:20.990
 but you see that is probably adapted 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:24.380
 is just then we come to spring 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:26.299
 the spring looks completely normal and 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.460
 yes, that is also completely normal 

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:31.789
 except that wherever sun comes out 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:33.319
 course grass and flowers grow 

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:35.990
 I do not have a thing yet 

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:38.869
 Said all seasons are seven 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:40.240
 minecraft for a long time you can believe that 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:41.359
 I in a configuration file 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.450
 to adjust 

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:47.420
 and there is this clock 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:49.249
 this is the season swatch the forces one 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.350
 so if you are there with right click 

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:54.799
 on it clicks you can see correct season 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:57.319
 So put spring early days 16 days yet 

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:58.639
 then season changes to the next 

00:01:57.319 --> 00:02:01.429
 So the next one would be the summer 

00:01:58.639 --> 00:02:02.959
 and so on every season goes 

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:05.119
 seven minecraft days long 

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:09.170
 There is the thermometer you can 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:11.120
 for the desert so for the summer 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:12.410
 and winter could use well though 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.209
 Actually, that's just a little fun 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:15.650
 because it does not work now 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:19.040
 much that you never get the displayed 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:21.260
 60 percent temperature is coming now 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.630
 But we are here for the summer 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:26.269
 summer and summer are the same 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:28.640
 that when it rains that there is no rain 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:30.020
 but is always a thunderstorm if it is 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.300
 snowing 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:34.520
 then it is rain but no rain 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:37.610
 so snow makes biom in the snow 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:41.000
 then rains wheat grows 15 times 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:42.470
 faster and the desert is as hot as 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.140
 you can see here with the forest thermometer 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:47.420
 She is at 220 percent 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:49.070
 which means that we are right in front of the 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:50.990
 get hydrogenation damage 

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:53.810
 but it only takes a while, though 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:55.490
 that it's still realistic 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:57.890
 made that you get hurt in the 

00:02:55.490 --> 00:03:00.260
 desert waltz in summer too 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:03.830
 the desert is mega hot, that's what we see 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:05.300
 right now we're hurting 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:10.160
 get the screen is too 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:13.310
 a bit red and york that 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:15.230
 is summer and winter 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:17.510
 actually you already could imagine 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.040
 is snow everywhere normally should 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:20.990
 but it also snow everywhere 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.580
 somehow that's what I like so much 

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:24.710
 somehow that it does not snow but 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:26.690
 actually it is snowing everywhere 

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:28.280
 but the snow disappears again 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:31.150
 if you switch to spring, then 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:35.600
 no fear mio 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:39.170
 the temperature is at 13 and if we are 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:42.110
 switch to an already cold bio like 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:44.420
 then get your goal of the plan plan 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:47.810
 We also hurt by the cold shock 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:52.000
 So it's super cold except when we're 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:55.280
 Equip now with leather completely 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.320
 then we will not get hurt 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:59.630
 I forgot to say that if you 

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:01.130
 equipping you in the desert with leather 

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:02.390
 then you get there and not the 

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:04.760
 harm hydrogenation 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:06.410
 and that 's it with the season swat 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:08.690
 usually when the season 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:10.850
 there is still a little picture coming 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:13.640
 with the writing and yes I wish you 

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:15.110
 Have fun with these horny seasons mod 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:18.609
 have fun with the different ones 

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:18.609
 seasons and ciao
