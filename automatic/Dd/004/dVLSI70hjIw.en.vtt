00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:57.820 
the Patriots caught the game the

00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:59.880 
the Patriots caught the game the

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:05.140 
as possible in the Packers I guess I

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:07.170 
as possible in the Packers I guess I
guess<00:04:05.830> it<00:04:06.010> just<00:04:06.040> played<00:04:06.310> to<00:04:06.459> conservative<00:04:07.000> and

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:07.180 
guess it just played to conservative and

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:08.970 
guess it just played to conservative and
they<00:04:07.269> couldn't<00:04:07.540> get<00:04:07.630> it<00:04:07.720> done<00:04:07.750> in<00:04:08.200> those<00:04:08.650> short

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:08.980 
they couldn't get it done in those short

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:10.590 
they couldn't get it done in those short

down yardage situations to start the

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:12.600 
down yardage situations to start the
game<00:04:10.780> out<00:04:11.019> they<00:04:11.350> could<00:04:11.500> have<00:04:11.590> been<00:04:11.680> up<00:04:11.830> 14<00:04:12.250> to<00:04:12.280> 0

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:12.610 
game out they could have been up 14 to 0

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:15.270 
game out they could have been up 14 to 0
21<00:04:12.970> and<00:04:13.360> 0<00:04:13.390> on<00:04:13.870> the<00:04:14.230> Seahawks<00:04:14.440> but<00:04:14.890> they<00:04:15.010> ended

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:15.280 
21 and 0 on the Seahawks but they ended

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:17.430 
21 and 0 on the Seahawks but they ended
up<00:04:15.400> settling<00:04:15.700> for<00:04:15.850> two<00:04:16.209> field<00:04:16.600> goals<00:04:16.660> in<00:04:17.080> the

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:17.440 
up settling for two field goals in the

up settling for two field goals in the
red<00:04:17.770> zone<00:04:17.799> so<00:04:18.609> that<00:04:18.640> right<00:04:18.910> there<00:04:19.090> probably

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:19.299 
red zone so that right there probably

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:20.909
