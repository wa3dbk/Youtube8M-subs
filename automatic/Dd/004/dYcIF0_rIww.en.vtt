particular<00:01:54.060> way<00:01:54.180> from<00:01:54.390> home<00:01:54.540> you<00:01:54.720> have<00:01:54.899> to

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
particular way from home you have to

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:58.010 
particular way from home you have to
scrape<00:01:55.590> a<00:01:55.799> draw<00:01:56.070> and<00:01:56.369> and<00:01:57.329> that<00:01:57.630> is<00:01:57.780> deemed

and we've gone from looking up and

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.609 
and we've gone from looking up and
seeing<00:02:03.329> ourselves<00:02:03.509> potentially<00:02:04.409> three

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
seeing ourselves potentially three

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.920 
seeing ourselves potentially three
points<00:02:04.950> off<00:02:05.040> city<00:02:05.340> so<00:02:06.210> now<00:02:06.329> being<00:02:06.630> just<00:02:06.869> one

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
points off city so now being just one

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.710 
points off city so now being just one

point away from from Tottenham and and

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.390 
point away from from Tottenham and and
that's<00:02:09.929> it<00:02:10.170> that's<00:02:10.319> a<00:02:10.500> massive<00:02:10.770> worry<00:02:11.160> and

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
that's it that's a massive worry and

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.040 
that's it that's a massive worry and
because

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
because

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:17.000
