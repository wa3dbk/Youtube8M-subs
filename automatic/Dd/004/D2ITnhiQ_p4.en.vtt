that i have so i'll be back when i've
installed<00:00:32.969> it<00:00:33.260> by<00:00:34.260> the<00:00:34.320> way<00:00:34.530> this<00:00:34.649> has<00:00:34.800> been

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
installed it by the way this has been

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.060 
installed it by the way this has been
working<00:00:35.280> fine<00:00:35.489> so<00:00:35.550> far<00:00:36.079> but<00:00:37.079> um<00:00:37.320> if<00:00:37.559> you<00:00:37.800> get<00:00:37.920> it

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
working fine so far but um if you get it

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.880 
working fine so far but um if you get it
could<00:00:38.219> not<00:00:38.399> connect<00:00:38.760> to<00:00:38.820> edge<00:00:39.140> its<00:00:40.140> most

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
could not connect to edge its most

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.119 
could not connect to edge its most
likely<00:00:41.160> your<00:00:42.170> Wi-Fi<00:00:43.170> settings<00:00:43.410> so<00:00:43.739> check<00:00:44.010> your

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
likely your Wi-Fi settings so check your

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.930 
likely your Wi-Fi settings so check your
router<00:00:44.329> arm<00:00:45.770> you<00:00:46.770> might<00:00:47.010> also<00:00:47.219> get<00:00:47.460> it<00:00:47.640> because

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
router arm you might also get it because

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.910 
router arm you might also get it because
there's<00:00:48.149> no<00:00:48.239> sim<00:00:48.539> that's<00:00:49.530> happened<00:00:49.890> before

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
there's no sim that's happened before

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.400 
there's no sim that's happened before
but<00:00:50.579> it's<00:00:51.059> most<00:00:51.510> likely<00:00:51.629> because<00:00:52.020> of<00:00:52.260> your

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
but it's most likely because of your

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.540 
but it's most likely because of your
router<00:00:52.590> so<00:00:52.920> I'll<00:00:53.960> disconnect<00:00:54.960> and<00:00:55.920> then

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
router so I'll disconnect and then

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.729 
router so I'll disconnect and then
reconnect<00:00:57.000> your<00:00:57.090> router<00:00:57.300> and<00:00:57.739> hopefully

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
reconnect your router and hopefully

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.299 
reconnect your router and hopefully
it'll<00:00:58.949> fix<00:00:59.579> that<00:00:59.789> problem<00:01:00.800> alright<00:01:01.800> so<00:01:02.010> here's

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
it'll fix that problem alright so here's

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.600

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:03.880 
on lock so sometimes you got to try it

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.020 
on lock so sometimes you got to try it
like<00:03:04.060> three<00:03:04.239> or<00:03:04.389> four<00:03:04.420> times<00:03:04.750> before<00:03:05.049> it'll

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
like three or four times before it'll

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.940 
like three or four times before it'll
actually<00:03:07.030> get<00:03:07.299> into<00:03:07.389> the<00:03:07.540> program<00:03:07.720> so<00:03:08.109> that's

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
actually get into the program so that's

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:11.460 
actually get into the program so that's
basically<00:03:09.100> that<00:03:10.200> probably<00:03:11.200> not<00:03:11.290> going<00:03:11.410> to
