back up here one second well now when
you<00:00:50.219> said<00:00:50.430> a<00:00:50.460> dual<00:00:50.820> density<00:00:51.260> what<00:00:52.260> exactly<00:00:52.800> do

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
you said a dual density what exactly do

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.680 
you said a dual density what exactly do
mean<00:00:53.190> by<00:00:53.340> dual<00:00:53.610> density<00:00:53.820> sole<00:00:54.239> does<00:00:54.390> that<00:00:54.510> mean

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
mean by dual density sole does that mean

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.000 
mean by dual density sole does that mean
that<00:00:54.870> it's<00:00:55.260> actually<00:00:55.559> got<00:00:55.680> two<00:00:55.860> different

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
that it's actually got two different

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.520 
that it's actually got two different
types<00:00:56.370> of<00:00:56.550> rubber<00:00:56.730> compound<00:00:57.239> so<00:00:57.570> yes<00:00:57.780> it<00:00:58.170> does

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
types of rubber compound so yes it does

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.369 
types of rubber compound so yes it does
this<00:00:58.949> bottom<00:00:59.489> layer<00:00:59.640> is<00:00:59.940> solid<00:01:00.390> rubber<00:01:00.600> okay

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
this bottom layer is solid rubber okay

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.349

good<00:01:05.309> against<00:01:05.610> chemicals<00:01:06.060> and<00:01:06.240> then<00:01:06.720> you<00:01:06.840> also

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
good against chemicals and then you also

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.080 
good against chemicals and then you also
have<00:01:07.380> this<00:01:07.590> second<00:01:08.040> layer<00:01:08.130> in<00:01:08.369> here<00:01:08.640> the<00:01:08.880> dual

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
density the second side okay see this is

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.760 
density the second side okay see this is
an<00:01:11.159> e<00:01:11.340> VA<00:01:11.520> now<00:01:11.880> a<00:01:11.909> VA<00:01:12.240> is<00:01:12.479> a<00:01:12.510> little<00:01:12.810> softer<00:01:13.380> it's

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
an e VA now a VA is a little softer it's

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.160 
an e VA now a VA is a little softer it's
not<00:01:13.979> as<00:01:14.189> dense<00:01:14.549> as<00:01:14.880> they're<00:01:15.689> gonna<00:01:15.810> get<00:01:15.990> with

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
not as dense as they're gonna get with

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.690 
not as dense as they're gonna get with
solid<00:01:16.500> rubber<00:01:16.530> for<00:01:17.189> the<00:01:17.220> hennas<00:01:17.490> here<00:01:17.670> I

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
solid rubber for the hennas here I

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.219 
solid rubber for the hennas here I
thought<00:01:17.970> you<00:01:18.150> were<00:01:18.240> calling<00:01:18.479> me<00:01:18.600> bitch<00:01:18.869> you

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
things

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.270 
things
it<00:01:21.840> makes<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.140> boot<00:01:22.229> lightweight<00:01:22.680> but<00:01:23.189> it

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
it makes the boot lightweight but it

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.380 
it makes the boot lightweight but it
also<00:01:23.369> makes<00:01:23.700> it<00:01:23.790> have<00:01:23.939> another<00:01:24.150> layer<00:01:24.360> of

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
also makes it have another layer of

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:25.969 
also makes it have another layer of
comfort<00:01:24.900> to<00:01:24.930> it<00:01:25.049> because<00:01:25.380> when<00:01:25.500> you<00:01:25.590> step<00:01:25.770> down

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
comfort to it because when you step down

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.830 
comfort to it because when you step down
on<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.189> boot<00:01:26.400> that<00:01:26.610> that's<00:01:27.119> soft<00:01:27.420> or<00:01:27.570> dense

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
on the boot that that's soft or dense

this the white and the red and the pink
in<00:01:46.560> the<00:01:46.770> blue<00:01:46.979> here<00:01:47.220> that's<00:01:47.430> actually<00:01:47.640> four

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
in the blue here that's actually four

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
this section is stiff because it wants

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.310 
this section is stiff because it wants

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
outside edge of this is a little less

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.730 
outside edge of this is a little less
dense<00:02:00.270> but<00:02:00.600> it's<00:02:00.719> still<00:02:00.930> got<00:02:01.079> a<00:02:01.110> stiffness<00:02:01.409> to

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
dense but it's still got a stiffness to

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.380 
dense but it's still got a stiffness to
it<00:02:01.770> that<00:02:02.219> is<00:02:02.340> to<00:02:02.460> hold<00:02:02.640> you<00:02:02.759> in<00:02:02.909> the<00:02:03.030> boot<00:02:03.210> so
