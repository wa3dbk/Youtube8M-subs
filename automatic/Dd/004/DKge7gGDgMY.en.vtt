00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
a good way to work on footwork and its

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.110 
a good way to work on footwork and its
forward<00:02:09.810> and<00:02:10.080> backward<00:02:10.470> footwork<00:02:10.770> as<00:02:10.950> well<00:02:11.160> so

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
forward and backward footwork as well so

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.000 
forward and backward footwork as well so
we're<00:02:12.239> talking<00:02:12.570> one<00:02:12.720> side<00:02:12.959> to<00:02:13.110> side<00:02:13.320> then

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.160 
we're talking one side to side then
there's<00:02:14.430> also<00:02:14.610> an<00:02:14.790> important<00:02:15.209> factor<00:02:15.600> of

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
there's also an important factor of

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.320 
there's also an important factor of
going<00:02:16.470> front<00:02:16.739> to<00:02:16.830> back<00:02:17.010> as<00:02:17.190> well<00:02:17.400> sometimes

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
going front to back as well sometimes

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.030 
going front to back as well sometimes
you<00:02:18.570> get<00:02:18.660> caught<00:02:18.870> forward<00:02:19.290> you<00:02:19.650> got<00:02:19.800> to<00:02:19.890> start

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
you get caught forward you got to start

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.610 
you get caught forward you got to start
going<00:02:20.220> back<00:02:20.630> the<00:02:21.630> key<00:02:21.780> thing<00:02:22.020> out<00:02:22.140> front<00:02:22.440> words

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
going back the key thing out front words

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.070 
going back the key thing out front words
and<00:02:22.830> forward<00:02:23.160> movement<00:02:23.489> it's<00:02:23.880> a<00:02:24.000> good<00:02:24.180> trying

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
and forward movement it's a good trying

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.890 
and forward movement it's a good trying
to<00:02:25.140> minimize<00:02:25.530> the<00:02:26.250> cross<00:02:26.489> leg<00:02:26.760> foot<00:02:27.030> so<00:02:27.810> when

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
to minimize the cross leg foot so when

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.820 
to minimize the cross leg foot so when
we're<00:02:28.050> going<00:02:28.170> forward<00:02:28.680> I<00:02:29.120> always<00:02:30.680> turn<00:02:31.680> my

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830

00:06:15.879 --> 00:06:15.889 
up and we'll get into that a little bit

00:06:15.889 --> 00:06:17.680

00:06:19.839 --> 00:06:19.849 
so this is just kind of working on

00:06:19.849 --> 00:06:30.790 
so this is just kind of working on
staying<00:06:20.719> square<00:06:20.870> and<00:06:21.139> just<00:06:21.259> basic<00:06:21.530> footwork

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:30.800 

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:33.740 

all<00:06:31.800> right<00:06:32.009> so<00:06:32.550> it's<00:06:32.939> just<00:06:33.120> it's<00:06:33.360> a<00:06:33.419> fun<00:06:33.599> little

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:33.750 
all right so it's just it's a fun little

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:35.899 
all right so it's just it's a fun little
one<00:06:34.050> for<00:06:34.710> that<00:06:34.800> little<00:06:35.009> short<00:06:35.400> choppy<00:06:35.699> steps

00:06:35.899 --> 00:06:35.909 
one for that little short choppy steps

00:06:35.909 --> 00:06:38.390 
one for that little short choppy steps
but<00:06:36.659> this<00:06:36.780> is<00:06:36.960> a<00:06:36.990> great<00:06:37.259> opportunity<00:06:37.530> to

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:38.400 
but this is a great opportunity to

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:40.399 
but this is a great opportunity to
really<00:06:38.639> teach<00:06:38.849> them<00:06:39.090> to<00:06:39.629> keep<00:06:39.810> those<00:06:40.110> legs

00:06:40.399 --> 00:06:40.409 
really teach them to keep those legs

00:06:40.409 --> 00:06:42.709 
really teach them to keep those legs
spread<00:06:40.710> apart<00:06:41.150> you<00:06:42.150> got<00:06:42.300> to<00:06:42.389> start<00:06:42.539> really

00:06:42.709 --> 00:06:42.719 
spread apart you got to start really

00:06:42.719 --> 00:06:44.089 
spread apart you got to start really
basic<00:06:43.139> a<00:06:43.199> lot<00:06:43.349> of<00:06:43.439> times<00:06:43.650> when<00:06:43.860> you're<00:06:43.979> working

00:06:44.089 --> 00:06:44.099 
basic a lot of times when you're working

00:06:44.099 --> 00:06:46.490 
basic a lot of times when you're working
with<00:06:44.370> to<00:06:44.490> tense<00:06:44.759> your<00:06:45.030> 911s<00:06:45.840> and<00:06:45.990> your<00:06:46.139> twelves

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:46.500

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:48.529 
with to tense your 911s and your twelves
but<00:06:47.250> it's<00:06:47.400> not<00:06:47.699> a<00:06:47.729> lot<00:06:47.939> of<00:06:48.030> technical<00:06:48.300> training

00:06:48.529 --> 00:06:48.539 
but it's not a lot of technical training

00:06:48.539 --> 00:06:50.950 
but it's not a lot of technical training
there<00:06:48.870> keep<00:06:49.830> the<00:06:49.860> legs<00:06:50.099> apart<00:06:50.250> a<00:06:50.550> little<00:06:50.639> bit

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:50.960 
there keep the legs apart a little bit
