 good people with the approval of the plan that can definitely 

00:00:15.659 --> 00:00:19.519
 and this is what I'm going to teach you to do in an area that is not in the 

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:22.519
 Part there will have another car 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:25.819

00:00:25.819 --> 00:00:28.509
 They will have to face the sport at sea. 

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:31.579
 let's select part will stay here our entry into day 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.840
 following the line that donated to the car's hand 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.500
 remembering what I'm doing here in the year there you can do it in any 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.500
 part of the car and you do in afternoon rodeo covers 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:48.080
 they injured here 

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:51.080
 they will have here the tool they wanted 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:54.610
 a black color 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:58.730
 and then on youtube a bikini 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.370
 such a 45 peacock 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:04.560
 We are going to do here what we are going to give the brush. 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.260
 estela parnes out of the selection 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.110
 only that anyway he's painting a little worse 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:14.440
 and writes what we will do will not paint the entire mystery selection 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.440
 just make a curve in your shadow said 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:29.630
 well done here apart the money will give the impression of depth in the 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:31.290
 wave of the day 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.240
 now you can make selection here 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.790
 could even do to avoid aspects of dengue in the state dr 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.110
 let the thrush leave more than a little 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.320
 pity the supreme ordered 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.510
 the system now here a bottom of the table 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:47.330
 of the intermediary 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:49.660
 and you're going to act like you're a man 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:52.680
 what's new here 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.270
 something like 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.620
 for us to give the impression of rone teams of three dimensions 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.939
 when he's going to do it now pick up an eyedropper and select that part more 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:07.590
 of course the car in case the visitors are doing and going to what 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.110
 only that this reason is to compensate or if they expect some clearer color 

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:14.579
 for the impression of 

00:02:14.579 --> 00:02:16.499
 of a third dimension 

00:02:16.499 --> 00:02:19.079
 And do you paint here? 

00:02:19.079 --> 00:02:21.899
 The selection is undone here. 

00:02:21.899 --> 00:02:23.959

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:35.049
 And it's going to come down here. 

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:38.049

 Natural 

00:02:57.429 --> 00:02:59.349

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:01.329
 That little hand here. 

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:05.459
