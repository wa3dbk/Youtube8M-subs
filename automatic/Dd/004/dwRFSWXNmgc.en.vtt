00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:10.629
 Hello Guitars station here guitar 1955 Stratocaster 

00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:13.330
 Heavy relic 

00:00:10.629 --> 00:00:18.610
 Master build by Jason Smith 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:24.490
 That maple neck in the ash body of the characteristic of the fact that 1955 

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:29.230
 It becomes combination, but this maple neck is 55 from normal 54 type 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:33.320
 So-called, but I'm a little bit to adopt a pad Naa v shape when it comes to year type 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:38.180
 For here is the so-called Clapton vehicles in order to enhance the preview 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:39.470
 It uses a v-shape that is said to be a roundabout 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:43.700
 wood 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:46.460
 In addition, fingerboard is 9.5 inches of jim dunlop 6105 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:47.590
 High Prairie called Fred 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:52.930
 Finn 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:54.770
 High considerable playability with a maple neck. Therefore I 9 section in the neck 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:58.550
 I think it has become 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:01:02.700
 Abigail's hand-bound fifties type for pickups 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:04.000
 These are also a little less and the output is also 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:09.940
 a little 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:15.220
 It becomes less, but it is this body, but the body is a total package 3 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:21.070
 As it becomes combination with light weight ash body which becomes approximately 3 kg in period 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:23.900
 With this thin coat obtained by making the neck and body and its heavy relic 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:28.760
 Packaging of Aso 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:33.290
 After becoming 300 by his select 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:38.060
 Betting brain floating setup for the bridge section too 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:39.560
 Decorated I'd have like put out strongly the direct sound of the nearest body setup 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:43.610
 Has been 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:47.390
 The combination of the maple neck and the ash body is still really high waist 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:48.350
 It is often said that it will become a bright pig character 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:53.460
 but 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:56.600
 As for this guitar, it is a lightweight part or a thin film 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:02:02.720
 More wrong place 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:04.549
 Plump part and thick character After the ash meet peak with tenacity 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:10.039
 Such as a pig character 

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:13.330
 I think it is a guitar that has a tone of 7 degrees , so by all means sound around 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:16.260
 I would like to confirm with the sample 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.260
