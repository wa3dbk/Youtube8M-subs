00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:20.090
 hello to you all Dmitri 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:22.340
 Demyanov today with you I will talk about 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:25.930
 automatic charge on this launcher 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:29.239
 device called pennant 55 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:31.790
 Then we have frosts and a battery like 

00:00:29.239 --> 00:00:33.020
 I started to get the blues that is 

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:35.570
 would have to take some 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:37.760
 actions with it recharge and so on 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:40.520
 that charger when i had 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:42.079
 before that she came out of the grass the most 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.899
 right moment and had to think 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:49.100
 about buying a new one and i stopped my 

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:52.700
 water selection such a device with the same to 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:56.390
 monitors here well let's see what 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:59.690
 does it have an effective of 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:08.090
 the technical characteristics of it to whom 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:10.130
 interesting can also look here 2 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:13.280
 produced at the length of it in St. Petersburg floor 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:18.110
 Soviet type batteries for which 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:21.319
 it is intended that is how everything will be 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:25.159
 it is described here well let's all the same 

00:01:21.319 --> 00:01:46.119
 look at the device itself which is there 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:49.119
 I find the box I choose one 

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:49.119
 pouch 

00:01:49.779 --> 00:02:02.810
 the pouch we see the instruction with the description 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:10.580
 in Russian 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:13.209
 everything is good but I bought quality 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.209
 this device 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:23.930
 for 2400 rubles and still want to believe 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:29.660
 that my grandfather corps will justify 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:33.130
 plastic pretty durable 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:36.070
 on / off button screen 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:46.190
 buttons 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:51.710
 navigation so rear compartment are laid 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:57.430
 the wires here are the blades here 

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:57.430
 there are plus or minus 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:06.560
 not here they are plus or minus 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:10.550
 that's natural 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:13.970
 our usual plug well the small screen tips 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:16.819
 I think the most basic thing we have 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:21.940
 interests me here now here I am 

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:21.940
 I live in a network, see what it shows us 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:39.130
 here when the soldiers shows the current shows 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:44.540
 voltage and show the running line 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:45.860
 as in the form of the data as given 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:48.430
 how much is received 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:51.080
 charge charge over charge not over 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:53.120
 here we have navigation using here 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:04:01.580
 these buttons but naturally connects 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:04:03.230
 turns off everything is on there is a profile and 

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:05.090
 customizable and which can be embedded 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:06.470
 the settings themselves are here 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:10.269
 can adjust the brightness 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:18.010
 sound navigation information display and 

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:20.120
 the main screen is like this 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:25.550
 the tip may be displayed may not 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:26.300
 would display the timer for example would choose 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:28.810
 first profile 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:32.870
 here we choose the current we need 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:35.770
 voltage and algorithm algorithm here 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:40.000
 five such different 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:46.880
 of which are automatic algorithms which 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:48.979
 charge the battery with certain 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:50.720
 a certain sequence well to 

00:04:48.979 --> 00:04:53.200
 For example, I will now show it by the way 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:53.200
 just 

00:04:54.789 --> 00:05:02.599
 so here they are our 55 algorithms that is 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:04.460
 algorithm 1 i.e. charges later 

00:05:02.599 --> 00:05:08.240
 gradually decreases then stepwise 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:10.849
 busy charges and in general here in different ways 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:16.029
 in general, for all sorts of different needs 

00:05:10.849 --> 00:05:18.939
 there are automatic modes also possible 

00:05:16.029 --> 00:05:23.779
 customize your modes 

00:05:18.939 --> 00:05:26.300
 by hand and another to pound he has it 

00:05:23.779 --> 00:05:28.930
 before launch what does it mean does it mean 

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:33.169
 that we connect it to the battery 

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:35.150
 either in the car immediately if you have 

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:36.650
 opportunity or drag 

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:38.710
 battery home if needed so 

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:41.029
 It happened 

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:44.389
 turn it on automatically 

00:05:41.029 --> 00:05:48.620
 become the maximum current turn on the outlet 

00:05:44.389 --> 00:05:51.080
 and charge it for about 5 to 30 minutes 

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:53.990
 that is, it takes the maximum current always 

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:56.599
 and if we would only charge the battery 

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:59.839
 then we set the battery to charge or have 

00:05:56.599 --> 00:06:02.120
 we have connected directly to the battery in 

00:05:59.839 --> 00:06:05.360
 the car is right with this device 

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:07.819
 try start try I 

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:10.550
 I think that everything should turn out by itself 

00:06:07.819 --> 00:06:13.279
 the device is very light and it is not even 

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:15.370
 knowing how much it hangs but now I have it 

00:06:13.279 --> 00:06:15.370
 will turn on 

00:06:17.439 --> 00:06:23.620
 there are such sheets 

00:06:20.409 --> 00:06:23.620
 What is her weight 

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:45.010
 Dec 

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:52.050
 you are there just so much is not visible 746 

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:54.419
 gram ie device 

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:58.169
 800 grams if the place was once something 

00:06:54.419 --> 00:07:00.599
 800 grams to throw is pretty light 

00:06:58.169 --> 00:07:01.819
 I hope the device will justify 

00:07:00.599 --> 00:07:07.099
 my hopes 

00:07:01.819 --> 00:07:10.340
 will charge my battery correctly 

00:07:07.099 --> 00:07:12.629
 so people looked at this device 

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:15.470
 good ingrid charges correctly 

00:07:12.629 --> 00:07:19.349
 his algorithm is all good too 

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:21.440
 it remains to try on him in practice as he 

00:07:19.349 --> 00:07:24.690
 charges it has recovery function 

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:27.300
 batteries, that is, pretty 

00:07:24.690 --> 00:07:29.819
 I will try the useful thing 

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:32.659
 experience but this is all new 

00:07:29.819 --> 00:07:32.659
 meetings goodbye
