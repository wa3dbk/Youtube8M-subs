00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.549
 the boy is called and he dies 3 a 

00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:06.200
 video about the xbox one and a few 

00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:08.210
 days the e3 where it is expected that microsoft 

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:10.099
 teach everything you do with your 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:11.210
 games and everything the gamers wanted 

00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:13.309
 see in the conference that they showed us 

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:14.960
 this will be for them they said that 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:17.480
 would be for e3 which is about three 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:19.609
 days then yesterday microsoft for 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.930
 let's say it lowers the clarify attention 

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:23.900
 certain doubts that many people had 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:25.519
 about the connection once every 24 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:27.619
 hours internet about used games 

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:30.080
 about if the one that was going to invade the 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:31.759
 privacy then microsoft yesterday pulled out 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:34.010
 all official policies and they said 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:35.630
 is and they said and told exactly how 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:37.280
 it would be this issue so pretty much 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:38.870
 I have this video to explain it is a 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.180
 bit tricky I will try to do 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:42.590
 a best possible way this way 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:43.940
 as clear as possible so it's the same 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:45.740
 gender link the links in the description 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.330
 so they can see the articles that 

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:48.740
 I read on your own and let's say if you do not 

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:50.570
 They understand how I tell them 

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:52.310
 they can read there but more or less like that 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.690
 is the thing with regards to the 

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:55.340
 microsoft internet connection said that 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:57.170
 no permanent connection is necessary 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:58.550
 we already knew the console is made 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.200
 they said that the console is made to 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:02.030
 that from time to time it sends 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:03.410
 updates to the cloud and know what 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.030
 games you bought then you have 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:05.990
 installed that game you sold or what 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.810
 game 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:10.640
 you no longer have to disable the 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:12.470
 license and they have eco control of 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.390
 all the games that you have and that 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.369
 are in your online bookstore then 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.350
 those one says to offer to play without 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:20.869
 offline connection for a period of 24 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:22.399
 hours in your main console and a work 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:25.189
 the remaining hours what does this mean 

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:28.039
 that you can play offline at home 

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:29.420
 for 24 hours and then when they pass 24 

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:31.399
 hours the one man and sister mandar 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.649
 an update signal to the cloud 

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:34.850
 if you can not send that signal your game will 

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:36.679
 block or you will not be able to play 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:37.580
 even be offline until the console 

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:39.799
 send that signal 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:42.080
 to the internet and know what you're doing 

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:43.789
 and if you play at a friend's house he goes to 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:46.850
 need to send that signal every hour in 

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:49.009
 every 24 hours so this one 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:50.360
 they also said that with when you buy 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:51.799
 a game this is installed and added to 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.110
 your online bookstore which is a good thing 

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:55.220
 and more like it compensated a bit the 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:56.929
 negative side because when you have 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:58.670
 when you play a game when you buy 

00:01:56.929 --> 00:02:00.110
 a game on xbox one you install it on your 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:01.729
 console then you can play games without 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.350
 need cd and it is added to your 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:05.780
 online bookstore that means you can 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:08.330
 get in your blog and login your 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.830
 xbox live at a friend's house 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.540
 getting online bookstore and can play 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.790
 any of your games without 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.469
 sometimes and always and as long as 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.359
 have an internet connection and themes 

00:02:15.469 --> 00:02:18.709
 from home, your friend will not be able to 

00:02:17.359 --> 00:02:21.709
 play those games because they were in your 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:23.450
 online bookstore but more or less there goes 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:25.430
 the thing with regard to the internet also 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.359
 they said that the updates of 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:27.739
 system and software are installed 

00:02:26.359 --> 00:02:28.730
 automatically the console on which it is 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:30.049
 turned off looks like the 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.329
 updates and this is what also 

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:34.040
 it has precision 4 and makes it even though 

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:34.849
 even if you are not in your house these are 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.290
 to download those updates 

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:38.870
 especially when you're not 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:40.639
 using when they are a title of 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:42.260
 the xbox one this title that has associated 

00:02:40.639 --> 00:02:44.180
 your account which means that you can 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.819
 access them by logging in from 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:48.620
 any those one and finally said 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:50.900
 that the xbox one will ask for at least one 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:52.189
 1.5 megabyte bandwidth per 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.780
 second so that is all this 

00:02:52.189 --> 00:02:55.549
 experience work optimal like them 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:56.510
 they wait so I guess this is going to 

00:02:55.549 --> 00:02:57.680
 clarify many doubts of those 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:59.629
 people who only live who have 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.829
 a very low connection take into account 

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:02.180
 that if they want all the functions 

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:04.099
 of theirs when they work well 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.480
 minimum will be 1.5 megabytes per 

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:08.120
 second of the internet so that everything 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:09.919
 work as they expect this too 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:11.359
 there were people asking and making your 

00:03:09.919 --> 00:03:13.340
 games installed on your console but if 

00:03:11.359 --> 00:03:14.599
 you lose your console you get damaged you lose 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:15.889
 your games with her since everything was 

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:17.190
 associated with just going to have to 

00:03:15.889 --> 00:03:18.600
 pay for your game again 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:22.020
 it's not like that you can buy a new one 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:23.430
 console and so is this year's above your 

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:25.250
 buy a new one but all are 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:27.750
 associated with your account as well as with 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:29.460
 connect your account to your new console and 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:31.110
 deactivated the data in which 

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:33.510
 you had lost before then everything 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:35.280
 It should work fine as some wait 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:37.410
 so that with respect to the connection 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.540
 online following with the used games and 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:40.770
 borrowed this microsoft has said that in 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.970
 your main console you can play 

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:45.000
 any game installed on it 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:46.440
 being connected or not but you can 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.450
 Share your library with up to one 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:50.310
 maximum of 10 people in your family or 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:51.840
 be your online library you can do 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:53.820
 that 10 people have access to them 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.380
 be your family or be friends then 

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:56.610
 those people can all those people 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:57.930
 can play the same game for example 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:00.000
 let's say you bought call of duty 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:02.070
 then install add you calculate your 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.840
 bookstore there may be 10 people in your 

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:05.610
 family all playing from the internet 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:07.500
 connected to your library carlos guti el 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:09.810
 same yours that you bought 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:11.010
 all at the same time which is something 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:12.690
 that you do not have precision 4 and it's something 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:14.400
 incredible and pretty good but 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:16.709
 obviously requires on the internet to 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:19.019
 this and a good connection I suppose and 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:20.780
 besides, I do not know if those 10 people 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:22.040
 it can change or it's like it has 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:23.600
 you add 10 people from the group so much 

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:25.130
 friends as a family but I do not know if you can 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:27.710
 like to eliminate those people so that 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:29.630
 so others enter that group so 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:32.690
 more or less there goes the thing with respect 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:33.620
 to lend the games is not told 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:35.270
 that these can play bocyl 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:36.110
 simultaneously without having to buy a 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:38.360
 cb 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:40.400
 you choose who enters that group of 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:42.550
 family can be friends or those who 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:44.630
 I have the ones to whom I give access 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:45.800
 As I told you, you do not know if you can 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:48.080
 eliminate or not the people who already 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:50.030
 you have added in that group this with 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:51.980
 regarding the second hand market that 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:53.300
 there Microsoft says it will not charge for 

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:54.860
 if it seems like a game to a friend that 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:57.380
 person does not beat will not have to pay 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:59.270
 to activate the game on your console that 

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:00.380
 it depends on the companies or the 

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:02.060
 companies the video games like 

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:04.220
 activision as ubisoft be the 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:07.160
 creators of the game they are going to be the 

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:08.870
 that they take care that if their games 

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:10.790
 they will have to pay to reactivate 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:13.520
 in another console and if you sell them 

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:15.380
 it will have to be to a store that is 

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:17.720
 associated that is that microsoft try 

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:18.889
 like gamestop like gaming europe or 

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:20.270
 you will not be able to sell your game in 

00:05:18.889 --> 00:05:22.340
 any store is going to be stores 

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:23.990
 that they have approved and it will be 

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:25.729
 question of the companies that created 

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:26.720
 the games see how much they charge for this or 

00:05:25.729 --> 00:05:28.730
 do not 

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:30.080
 They said you can loan the games and 

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:32.780
 finally for when the proton plays 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:35.030
 a friend said that each title in the 

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:36.110
 hand can lend once or that is 

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:37.970
 we lend titles to a friend and that 

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:39.530
 person can not return it or 

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:41.450
 if you give it back to you , you can not do it 

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:43.100
 can only lend to another person and nothing 

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:45.680
 more you can lend it to a friend who 

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:47.180
 Take at least 30 days on your list 

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:48.590
 friends so it's not going to be that he's going to 

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:50.510
 a friend who is at stake and you 

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:52.130
 you do not have to add it and then 

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:54.110
 30 days that is on your enemies list 

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:56.450
 Well, that person can play your game 

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:58.370
 then how did he say this thing 

00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:59.990
 it's kind of confusing I know it so like 

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:01.910
 I told them you can see the description for 

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:04.190
 see the articles and read them for their 

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:05.180
 account and clarify doubts but the 

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:06.530
 I really do not like them 

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:08.150
 personally I like what is best 

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:09.380
 doing I know that you will lose many clients 

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:11.390
 much everyone I know that also 

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:13.070
 will have a very good clientele since 

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:14.600
 all these services that require 

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:16.550
 have quality are good but always 

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:17.630
 when you have a good connection between the 

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:19.130
 people who are good connection are going to 

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:21.340
 take advantage of all this with the 

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:24.200
 people that do not and that I know that a lot goes to 

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:25.880
 stop playing vox juan is or is not going to 

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:29.270
 want for nothing thing that this console and 

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:31.010
 I understand why finally that micro 

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:32.330
 left over the kinect they said no 

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:33.350
 we did not not going to be any 

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:35.390
 privacy problem with him 

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:37.370
 that you can deactivate that you can 

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:38.780
 configure as you choose that when the 

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:40.220
 console is off the chemistry is more 

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:42.380
 On when the seam is off 

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:44.600
 the only thing he expects is that you say xbox 

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:45.860
 or not or it's surprising or is it going to be the 

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:48.200
 only command of vos that the de bosc 

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:49.370
 approve when it's off and that everything 

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:50.780
 what it has to do with you have all 

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:52.310
 the privacy options you are going to 

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:53.840
 can configure and all that will be 

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:55.010
 your question or when you can 

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:57.170
 get into the configurations of 

00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:59.030
 system in kinect configurations 

00:06:57.170 --> 00:07:00.800
 and all that you test and you see that what 

00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:02.030
 that can do the kinect so the 

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:04.430
 people can stop worrying about the 

00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:05.570
 things of privacy and well then more or 

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:07.400
 less this what will do this what has 

00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:08.830
 created micros or policies of all these 

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:10.760
 issues that many are worried about 

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:12.110
 possibly if a lot of people are followed 

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:13.670
 complaining as they are already complaining about this 

00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:14.960
 change it but these are the things that 

00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:15.830
 I cross clarified and they have said that goes 

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:17.300
 to be like that 

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:18.670
 so finally I repeat if you are 

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:20.720
 they were confused in the description 

00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:21.830
 this this sixth game but that they 

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:22.850
 have liked do not forget if you want 

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:24.290
 some the three videos that are shown 

00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:25.490
 at the end I greet you all we do not see 

00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:27.740
 recent video do not forget leave the 

00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:30.160
 comments questions ask what is already 

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:30.160
