steam is you've got the close-up lens on

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.950 
steam is you've got the close-up lens on
and<00:00:10.830> the<00:00:11.820> target<00:00:12.240> is<00:00:12.389> a<00:00:12.420> little<00:00:12.780> out<00:00:12.929> of

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
distance out of focus distance and we're

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.689 
distance out of focus distance and we're
interested<00:00:17.279> in<00:00:17.640> this<00:00:19.220> and<00:00:20.220> we're<00:00:20.400> interested

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
across the river on some tree leaves

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.790 
across the river on some tree leaves
these<00:00:52.980> white<00:00:53.370> splotches<00:00:53.789> and<00:00:54.449> as<00:00:55.320> he<00:00:55.559> looked

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
these white splotches and as he looked

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.500 
these white splotches and as he looked
at<00:00:56.100> him<00:00:56.309> and<00:00:56.520> saw<00:00:56.730> him<00:00:56.760> in<00:00:57.000> different<00:00:57.329> places

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
at him and saw him in different places

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:03.020 
at him and saw him in different places
he<00:00:57.870> knew<00:00:57.989> it<00:00:58.109> wasn't<00:00:58.730> bird<00:00:59.730> defecation<00:01:02.030> now

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
he knew it wasn't bird defecation now

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.789 
he knew it wasn't bird defecation now
these<00:01:03.329> obviously<00:01:04.019> have<00:01:04.379> hatched<00:01:06.650> but<00:01:07.650> we

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
these obviously have hatched but we

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:13.040 
these obviously have hatched but we
might<00:01:07.979> ask<00:01:08.280> ourselves

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:13.050 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:21.460 

what<00:01:13.680> is<00:01:13.860> this<00:01:16.130> now<00:01:17.130> this<00:01:17.820> has<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.540> imprint<00:01:19.230> of

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:21.470 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:29.630 

the<00:01:22.470> leaf<00:01:22.920> surface<00:01:23.990> uncle<00:01:24.990> Steve<00:01:25.200> thinks

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:36.320 

no<00:01:31.010> it's<00:01:32.010> something<00:01:32.340> else<00:01:34.970> that<00:01:35.970> the<00:01:36.090> Steve

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:36.330 
no it's something else that the Steve

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:42.230 
no it's something else that the Steve
doesn't<00:01:36.600> know<00:01:36.870> what<00:01:37.110> it<00:01:37.229> is<00:01:40.610> it<00:01:41.610> still<00:01:42.000> doesn't

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
doesn't know what it is it still doesn't

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.680 
doesn't know what it is it still doesn't
think<00:01:42.540> this<00:01:42.720> is<00:01:42.869> bird<00:01:43.140> species

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:47.690 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:50.110 

there<00:01:48.290> was<00:01:48.500> definitely<00:01:49.040> some<00:01:49.670> kind<00:01:50.000> of

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:50.120 
there was definitely some kind of

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:53.110 
there was definitely some kind of
structure<00:01:50.540> in<00:01:50.900> there<00:01:51.610> fibrous<00:01:52.610> with

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:53.120 
structure in there fibrous with

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:55.870 
structure in there fibrous with
something<00:01:53.630> between<00:01:53.870> the<00:01:54.320> matrix<00:01:54.770> filling<00:01:55.760> the

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:55.880 
something between the matrix filling the

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:00.700 
something between the matrix filling the
matrix<00:01:58.630> well<00:01:59.630> the<00:01:59.750> steve<00:01:59.990> is<00:02:00.140> going<00:02:00.350> to<00:02:00.410> take<00:02:00.680> a

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:00.710 
matrix well the steve is going to take a

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:04.360 
matrix well the steve is going to take a
couple<00:02:01.040> of<00:02:01.310> these<00:02:01.660> home<00:02:02.660> with<00:02:02.990> them<00:02:03.230> and<00:02:03.470> try

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:04.370 
couple of these home with them and try

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:07.480 
couple of these home with them and try
to<00:02:04.400> photograph<00:02:04.850> them<00:02:05.390> to<00:02:05.570> get<00:02:05.750> stills<00:02:06.490> maybe

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490 
to photograph them to get stills maybe

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:10.570 
to photograph them to get stills maybe
we<00:02:07.850> can<00:02:08.030> figure<00:02:08.300> out<00:02:08.450> what<00:02:08.899> this<00:02:09.110> is<00:02:09.340> so<00:02:10.340> this

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580 
we can figure out what this is so this

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:14.440 
we can figure out what this is so this
is<00:02:10.610> preliminary<00:02:11.030> and<00:02:12.010> we'll<00:02:13.010> say<00:02:13.430> on<00:02:13.700> interim

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
is preliminary and we'll say on interim

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.590 
is preliminary and we'll say on interim
adios<00:02:14.960> and<00:02:15.440> we'll<00:02:16.370> take<00:02:16.580> a<00:02:16.610> few<00:02:16.940> samples<00:02:17.420> home

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:17.600 
adios and we'll take a few samples home

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.480 
adios and we'll take a few samples home
with<00:02:17.780> us<00:02:17.960> and<00:02:18.260> see<00:02:18.500> what<00:02:18.680> we<00:02:18.830> can<00:02:19.010> do<00:02:19.160> with<00:02:19.310> them

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:19.490 
with us and see what we can do with them

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:23.230 
with us and see what we can do with them
in<00:02:20.090> terms<00:02:20.150> of<00:02:20.600> a<00:02:21.190> determination<00:02:22.190> of<00:02:22.520> what<00:02:23.030> it

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:23.240 
in terms of a determination of what it

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:33.430 
in terms of a determination of what it
is<00:02:24.910> adios<00:02:25.910> for<00:02:26.210> now<00:02:31.540> well<00:02:32.540> boys<00:02:32.780> and<00:02:33.020> girls<00:02:33.260> of
