his<00:01:45.149> swing<00:01:45.450> or<00:01:45.600> even<00:01:45.810> you<00:01:46.439> know<00:01:46.560> a<00:01:46.590> younger

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
his swing or even you know a younger

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.330 
his swing or even you know a younger
younger<00:01:47.490> athletes<00:01:48.090> swing<00:01:49.189> because<00:01:50.189> the

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
younger athletes swing because the

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.550 
younger athletes swing because the
cameras<00:01:50.670> only<00:01:50.790> taken<00:01:51.240> 30<00:01:51.540> 30<00:01:51.990> pictures<00:01:52.229> per

cameras only taken 30 30 pictures per
second<00:01:53.450> movements<00:01:54.450> that<00:01:54.570> are<00:01:54.630> really<00:01:54.869> fast

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
second movements that are really fast

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.080 
second movements that are really fast
like<00:01:55.409> throwing<00:01:55.890> a<00:01:55.950> baseball<00:01:56.130> or<00:01:56.670> swinging<00:01:56.969> a

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090

like throwing a baseball or swinging a
bat<00:01:57.299> are<00:01:57.659> going<00:01:58.020> to<00:01:58.079> be<00:01:58.350> extremely<00:01:59.100> blurry<00:01:59.490> so

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
bat are going to be extremely blurry so

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.190 
bat are going to be extremely blurry so
that's<00:02:00.090> kind<00:02:00.329> of<00:02:00.390> the<00:02:00.450> value<00:02:00.810> that<00:02:00.840> you<00:02:01.049> get

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
that's kind of the value that you get

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.920 
that's kind of the value that you get
out<00:02:01.320> of<00:02:01.409> the<00:02:01.469> high-speed<00:02:01.890> camera<00:02:02.189> a<00:02:03.180> little

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
out of the high-speed camera a little

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.149 
out of the high-speed camera a little
bit<00:02:04.020> later<00:02:04.229> here<00:02:04.350> we're<00:02:04.770> going<00:02:04.860> to<00:02:04.950> go<00:02:05.130> ahead

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
bit later here we're going to go ahead

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.039 
bit later here we're going to go ahead
and<00:02:05.430> do<00:02:05.640> some<00:02:05.969> video<00:02:06.210> analysis<00:02:06.780> where<00:02:07.020> we

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
and do some video analysis where we

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:11.660 
and do some video analysis where we
actually<00:02:07.489> crank<00:02:08.489> it<00:02:08.610> up<00:02:08.700> to<00:02:09.709> 480

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
actually crank it up to 480

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:16.120 
actually crank it up to 480
frames<00:02:12.330> per<00:02:12.569> second<00:02:12.959> and<00:02:13.700> that<00:02:14.700> basically

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
frames per second and that basically

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:18.620 
frames per second and that basically
what<00:02:17.130> you're<00:02:17.220> going<00:02:17.370> to<00:02:17.430> find<00:02:17.459> is<00:02:18.150> you<00:02:18.360> can<00:02:18.510> see

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
what you're going to find is you can see

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.710 
what you're going to find is you can see
it<00:02:18.750> even<00:02:18.900> the<00:02:19.440> the<00:02:19.709> movement<00:02:20.010> even<00:02:20.130> slower<00:02:20.720> but

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
it even the the movement even slower but

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.110 
it even the the movement even slower but
it<00:02:22.160> decreases<00:02:23.160> the<00:02:23.310> quality<00:02:23.790> and<00:02:23.819> we'll<00:02:24.000> go

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
it decreases the quality and we'll go

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.420 
it decreases the quality and we'll go
ahead<00:02:24.180> and<00:02:24.270> show<00:02:24.630> an<00:02:25.260> example<00:02:25.560> of<00:02:25.800> that<00:02:25.890> here

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
ahead and show an example of that here

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.569 
ahead and show an example of that here
in<00:02:27.000> the<00:02:27.120> next<00:02:27.330> video
