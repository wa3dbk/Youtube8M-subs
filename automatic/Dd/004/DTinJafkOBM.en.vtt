lovely little roots on there all you
need<00:00:41.550> to<00:00:41.730> do<00:00:41.910> is<00:00:41.940> to<00:00:42.329> plug<00:00:42.570> them<00:00:42.870> down<00:00:43.140> about

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
need to do is to plug them down about

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.369 
need to do is to plug them down about
halfway<00:00:43.950> up<00:00:44.430> the<00:00:44.489> stem<00:00:45.090> that<00:00:45.840> will<00:00:46.050> give<00:00:46.200> them

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
halfway up the stem that will give them

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.100 
halfway up the stem that will give them
the<00:00:46.500> support<00:00:46.680> that<00:00:47.610> they<00:00:47.820> need<00:00:47.850> and<00:00:48.390> then<00:00:48.930> they

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
the support that they need and then they

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.040 
the support that they need and then they
will<00:00:49.289> grow<00:00:49.469> up<00:00:49.800> and<00:00:50.100> out<00:00:50.660> so<00:00:51.660> as<00:00:51.840> long<00:00:51.989> as

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
will grow up and out so as long as

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.840 
will grow up and out so as long as
you've<00:00:52.260> got<00:00:52.289> pots<00:00:52.739> that<00:00:52.890> are<00:00:53.010> relatively<00:00:53.430> deep

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
you've got pots that are relatively deep

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.020 
you've got pots that are relatively deep
so<00:00:54.090> we'll<00:00:54.270> just<00:00:54.420> put<00:00:54.600> that<00:00:54.809> in<00:00:55.020> and<00:00:55.789> it's<00:00:56.789> now

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
so we'll just put that in and it's now

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.130 
so we'll just put that in and it's now
about<00:00:57.420> half<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:58.079> size<00:00:58.109> that<00:00:58.590> it<00:00:58.710> was<00:00:58.920> before

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:00.140 
about half the size that it was before

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.609 
about half the size that it was before
so<00:01:01.140> push<00:01:01.500> that<00:01:01.710> down<00:01:01.980> very<00:01:02.609> very<00:01:02.730> carefully

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:03.619 
so push that down very very carefully

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:07.670 
so push that down very very carefully
there<00:01:04.619> we<00:01:04.799> are<00:01:04.830> and<00:01:05.159> that<00:01:05.700> like<00:01:06.570> that<00:01:06.900> will

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
there we are and that like that will

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.490 
there we are and that like that will
grow<00:01:07.950> out<00:01:07.979> nice<00:01:08.520> and<00:01:08.549> firm<00:01:09.240> and<00:01:09.510> nice<00:01:10.140> and

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
grow out nice and firm and nice and

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.830 
grow out nice and firm and nice and
solid<00:01:11.150> now<00:01:12.150> again<00:01:12.330> be<00:01:12.930> very<00:01:12.960> very<00:01:13.860> careful

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840 
solid now again be very very careful

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.630 
solid now again be very very careful
with<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:16.140> roots<00:01:16.409> and<00:01:16.710> with<00:01:17.159> the<00:01:17.369> little

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
with the roots and with the little

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.679 
with the roots and with the little
plants<00:01:19.159> most<00:01:20.159> of<00:01:20.430> them<00:01:20.640> these<00:01:21.090> are<00:01:21.330> the<00:01:21.420> first

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
plants most of them these are the first

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:22.999 
plants most of them these are the first
leaves<00:01:22.140> that<00:01:22.380> they<00:01:22.500> had<00:01:22.680> they've<00:01:22.860> actually

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
leaves that they had they've actually

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.590 
leaves that they had they've actually
gone<00:01:23.369> yellow<00:01:23.820> now<00:01:24.000> but<00:01:24.150> that's<00:01:24.270> fine<00:01:24.540> because

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
gone yellow now but that's fine because

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.140 
gone yellow now but that's fine because
they<00:01:25.020> don't<00:01:25.200> need<00:01:25.409> those<00:01:25.680> and<00:01:25.979> then<00:01:26.820> we've<00:01:27.119> got

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
they don't need those and then we've got

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.060 
they don't need those and then we've got
the<00:01:27.570> first<00:01:27.869> set<00:01:28.170> of<00:01:28.200> true<00:01:28.560> leaves<00:01:28.740> and<00:01:28.950> then

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
the first set of true leaves and then

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.760 
the first set of true leaves and then
we've<00:01:29.280> got<00:01:29.310> some<00:01:29.759> more<00:01:30.000> leaves<00:01:30.329> coming<00:01:30.840> now

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
we've got some more leaves coming now

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.190 
we've got some more leaves coming now
when<00:01:32.070> you<00:01:32.189> pick<00:01:32.490> them<00:01:32.670> up<00:01:32.850> some<00:01:33.720> people<00:01:34.049> say

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
when you pick them up some people say

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.870 
when you pick them up some people say
pick<00:01:34.439> them<00:01:34.590> up<00:01:34.650> by<00:01:34.860> the<00:01:34.920> leaves<00:01:35.250> or<00:01:35.640> the<00:01:35.729> little

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
pick them up by the leaves or the little

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.030 
pick them up by the leaves or the little
baby<00:01:36.180> leaves<00:01:36.509> and<00:01:36.750> if<00:01:37.170> they<00:01:37.320> break<00:01:37.530> it<00:01:37.740> doesn't

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
baby leaves and if they break it doesn't

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.120 
baby leaves and if they break it doesn't
matter<00:01:38.250> and<00:01:38.670> you<00:01:39.509> can<00:01:39.780> do<00:01:40.020> that<00:01:40.049> but<00:01:40.860> I<00:01:40.920> get

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
matter and you can do that but I get

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.789 
matter and you can do that but I get
hold<00:01:41.700> of<00:01:41.850> them<00:01:42.060> underneath<00:01:42.720> when<00:01:43.380> I<00:01:43.409> got<00:01:43.740> that

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
hold of them underneath when I got that

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.249 
hold of them underneath when I got that
one<00:01:44.070> out<00:01:44.220> underneath<00:01:44.700> and<00:01:45.119> you<00:01:45.600> kind<00:01:45.899> of<00:01:45.990> hold

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
one out underneath and you kind of hold

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.069 
one out underneath and you kind of hold
it<00:01:46.470> like<00:01:46.680> that<00:01:46.860> on<00:01:46.920> its<00:01:47.310> bottom<00:01:47.610> and<00:01:48.079> resting

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
it like that on its bottom and resting

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.889 
it like that on its bottom and resting
it<00:01:49.229> on<00:01:49.350> its<00:01:49.590> side<00:01:49.740> like<00:01:49.950> that<00:01:50.579> and<00:01:50.850> I<00:01:51.270> just<00:01:51.540> find

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
it on its side like that and I just find

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.740 
it on its side like that and I just find
that<00:01:52.020> that's<00:01:52.200> just<00:01:52.500> a<00:01:52.680> little<00:01:52.950> bit<00:01:53.280> more<00:01:53.750> solid

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
that that's just a little bit more solid

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.469 
that that's just a little bit more solid
and<00:01:54.990> a<00:01:55.290> little<00:01:55.560> bit<00:01:55.710> more<00:01:56.219> safer<00:01:56.939> and<00:01:57.149> you

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
and a little bit more safer and you

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.870 
and a little bit more safer and you
won't<00:01:57.750> break<00:01:58.049> any<00:01:58.320> leaves<00:01:58.649> but<00:01:59.040> just<00:01:59.399> be<00:01:59.640> very

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
won't break any leaves but just be very

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:00.480 
won't break any leaves but just be very
careful

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:00.490 
careful

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:04.260 
careful

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
these as we did with the melons will

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:12.809 
these as we did with the melons will
water<00:02:10.030> them<00:02:10.420> and<00:02:10.630> then<00:02:11.319> we'll<00:02:11.739> put<00:02:11.770> a<00:02:11.980> few<00:02:12.400> slug

water them and then we'll put a few slug
pellets<00:02:13.090> around<00:02:13.510> them<00:02:13.750> they<00:02:14.410> need<00:02:14.709> to<00:02:14.860> stay<00:02:15.190> in

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:15.459 
pellets around them they need to stay in

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:18.290 
pellets around them they need to stay in
this<00:02:16.060> little<00:02:16.510> sin<00:02:16.930> their<00:02:17.140> little<00:02:17.410> pots<00:02:17.680> here

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
this little sin their little pots here

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.540 
this little sin their little pots here
for<00:02:19.300> another<00:02:19.720> few<00:02:20.230> weeks<00:02:20.310> because<00:02:21.310> they're

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
for another few weeks because they're

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:24.420 
for another few weeks because they're
just<00:02:21.849> too<00:02:22.000> tiny<00:02:22.480> to<00:02:22.690> put<00:02:23.019> out<00:02:23.230> so<00:02:23.980> we'll<00:02:24.190> keep

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
just too tiny to put out so we'll keep

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.370 
just too tiny to put out so we'll keep
them<00:02:24.700> warm<00:02:24.970> in<00:02:25.209> the<00:02:25.360> greenhouse<00:02:25.959> and

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.380 
them warm in the greenhouse and

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.500 
them warm in the greenhouse and
gradually<00:02:27.340> acclimatize<00:02:28.030> them<00:02:28.269> to<00:02:28.420> the

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
gradually acclimatize them to the

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.380 
gradually acclimatize them to the
outside<00:02:28.959> by<00:02:29.170> leaving<00:02:29.470> the<00:02:30.220> door<00:02:30.610> open<00:02:30.819> of<00:02:31.269> the

outside by leaving the door open of the

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:34.350 
outside by leaving the door open of the
greenhouse<00:02:31.660> during<00:02:32.410> the<00:02:32.530> night<00:02:32.769> and<00:02:33.360> I'll

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
greenhouse during the night and I'll

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:39.479 
greenhouse during the night and I'll
then<00:02:34.660> show<00:02:35.470> you<00:02:35.819> the<00:02:36.900> Calabrese<00:02:38.430> now<00:02:39.430> the

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
Calabrese here has done exactly the same

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:47.270 
Calabrese here has done exactly the same
as<00:02:43.209> the<00:02:43.989> cauliflower<00:02:44.700> it's<00:02:45.700> gone<00:02:46.060> quite<00:02:46.690> niggy

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
as the cauliflower it's gone quite niggy

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.729 
as the cauliflower it's gone quite niggy
but<00:02:48.280> as<00:02:48.549> before<00:02:49.000> don't<00:02:49.269> worry<00:02:49.510> about<00:02:49.630> it<00:02:50.140> we

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:50.739 
but as before don't worry about it we

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:53.039 
but as before don't worry about it we
got<00:02:50.890> to<00:02:51.130> their<00:02:51.370> very<00:02:51.760> very<00:02:52.060> close<00:02:52.360> together<00:02:52.600> so

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:53.049 
got to their very very close together so

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:57.710 
got to their very very close together so
we'll<00:02:53.620> very<00:02:54.130> very<00:02:54.819> gently<00:02:55.860> tease<00:02:56.860> them<00:02:57.400> apart

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
we'll very very gently tease them apart

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.120 
we'll very very gently tease them apart
now<00:02:58.720> they've<00:02:58.900> all<00:02:59.019> got<00:02:59.260> very<00:02:59.620> good<00:02:59.739> root

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
now they've all got very good root

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:02.670 
now they've all got very good root
systems<00:03:00.670> on<00:03:00.940> them<00:03:01.209> lots<00:03:02.019> of<00:03:02.170> little<00:03:02.470> ones

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
systems on them lots of little ones

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.130 
systems on them lots of little ones
there<00:03:03.099> now<00:03:03.670> these<00:03:03.970> might<00:03:04.540> not<00:03:04.840> be<00:03:04.989> because

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:05.140 
there now these might not be because

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:07.349 
there now these might not be because
they've<00:03:05.470> got<00:03:05.650> quite<00:03:05.950> tall<00:03:06.489> these<00:03:06.880> might<00:03:07.120> not

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:07.359 
they've got quite tall these might not

00:03:07.359 --> 00:03:09.630 
they've got quite tall these might not
be<00:03:07.540> any<00:03:07.720> good<00:03:07.989> for<00:03:08.049> them<00:03:08.530> I<00:03:08.709> might<00:03:09.160> need<00:03:09.370> to<00:03:09.459> put

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:09.640 
be any good for them I might need to put

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:11.880 
be any good for them I might need to put
them<00:03:09.760> in<00:03:09.850> something<00:03:10.150> a<00:03:10.480> little<00:03:10.750> bit<00:03:11.170> deeper

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:11.890 
them in something a little bit deeper

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:14.940 
them in something a little bit deeper
just<00:03:12.519> to<00:03:12.760> get<00:03:13.030> them<00:03:13.209> down<00:03:13.480> a<00:03:14.200> little<00:03:14.739> bit

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
just to get them down a little bit

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:18.240 
just to get them down a little bit
further<00:03:15.310> now<00:03:15.790> these<00:03:16.739> because<00:03:17.739> they're<00:03:17.980> very

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.250 
further now these because they're very

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:21.300 
further now these because they're very
tall<00:03:18.609> I'll<00:03:18.910> most<00:03:19.720> probably<00:03:20.260> put<00:03:20.709> them<00:03:20.980> in<00:03:21.160> the

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.310 
tall I'll most probably put them in the

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:24.210 
tall I'll most probably put them in the
soil<00:03:21.609> down<00:03:21.910> to<00:03:22.150> just<00:03:22.420> above<00:03:22.810> the<00:03:22.870> first<00:03:23.380> leaves

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.220 
soil down to just above the first leaves

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.099 
soil down to just above the first leaves
that<00:03:24.549> have<00:03:24.609> come<00:03:24.940> out<00:03:25.000> the<00:03:25.299> baby<00:03:25.540> leaves<00:03:25.930> that

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:26.109 
that have come out the baby leaves that

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:27.569 
that have come out the baby leaves that
have<00:03:26.170> come<00:03:26.350> out<00:03:26.410> because<00:03:26.650> they<00:03:26.890> they<00:03:27.130> don't

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:27.579 
have come out because they they don't

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:30.569 
have come out because they they don't
worry<00:03:28.000> so<00:03:28.900> then<00:03:29.230> it<00:03:29.410> will<00:03:29.530> be<00:03:29.650> up<00:03:29.769> to<00:03:29.799> there<00:03:30.280> and

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:30.579 
worry so then it will be up to there and

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:32.910 
worry so then it will be up to there and
I'll<00:03:31.180> plant<00:03:31.510> them<00:03:31.690> straight<00:03:32.079> and<00:03:32.380> then

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:32.920 
I'll plant them straight and then

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:37.050 
I'll plant them straight and then
they'll<00:03:33.370> be<00:03:33.730> nice<00:03:34.510> and<00:03:34.569> sturdy<00:03:35.700> so<00:03:36.700> I'll<00:03:36.819> do

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.060 
they'll be nice and sturdy so I'll do

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.240 
they'll be nice and sturdy so I'll do
those<00:03:37.329> and<00:03:37.660> the<00:03:38.170> Brussels<00:03:38.739> have<00:03:38.890> done<00:03:39.069> the

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.250 
those and the Brussels have done the

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:40.800 
those and the Brussels have done the
same<00:03:39.280> they're<00:03:39.700> coming<00:03:40.030> up<00:03:40.120> a<00:03:40.209> lovely<00:03:40.510> purple

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:40.810 
same they're coming up a lovely purple

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:44.070 
same they're coming up a lovely purple
color

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:44.080 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:46.410 

this<00:03:44.740> is<00:03:44.920> just<00:03:45.160> because<00:03:45.550> the<00:03:45.700> only<00:03:45.970> reason

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:46.420 
this is just because the only reason

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:50.400 
this is just because the only reason
they've<00:03:46.600> gone<00:03:47.040> leggy<00:03:48.040> is<00:03:48.810> because<00:03:49.810> they<00:03:50.350> were

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:50.410 
they've gone leggy is because they were

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:52.110 
they've gone leggy is because they were
stretching<00:03:51.160> for<00:03:51.430> the<00:03:51.520> light<00:03:51.730> they<00:03:52.060> were

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120 
stretching for the light they were

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.300 
stretching for the light they were
underneath<00:03:52.840> for<00:03:53.260> a<00:03:53.290> little<00:03:53.470> bit<00:03:53.740> too<00:03:54.010> long<00:03:54.280> I

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.310 
underneath for a little bit too long I

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:56.850 
underneath for a little bit too long I
couldn't<00:03:54.820> get<00:03:55.000> out<00:03:55.030> and<00:03:55.450> change<00:03:56.350> them<00:03:56.590> round

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:56.860 
couldn't get out and change them round

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:59.340 
couldn't get out and change them round
so<00:03:57.610> they've<00:03:58.030> just<00:03:58.300> gone<00:03:58.540> a<00:03:58.600> little<00:03:58.810> bit<00:03:59.110> leggy

00:03:59.340 --> 00:03:59.350 
so they've just gone a little bit leggy

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:01.140 
so they've just gone a little bit leggy
as<00:03:59.620> well<00:03:59.830> but<00:04:00.130> that<00:04:00.190> doesn't<00:04:00.640> matter<00:04:00.760> I'll

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:01.150 
as well but that doesn't matter I'll

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:03.180 
as well but that doesn't matter I'll
plant<00:04:01.750> them<00:04:01.930> just<00:04:02.140> above<00:04:02.380> the<00:04:02.440> first<00:04:02.830> leaves

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:03.190 
plant them just above the first leaves

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:09.420 
plant them just above the first leaves
and<00:04:04.200> then<00:04:05.200> they'll<00:04:05.740> be<00:04:05.770> absolutely<00:04:06.760> fine<00:04:08.430> well

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:09.430 
and then they'll be absolutely fine well

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:12.060
