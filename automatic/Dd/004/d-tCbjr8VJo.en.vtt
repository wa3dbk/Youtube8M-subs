can see here these are the cables that

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.920 
can see here these are the cables that
are<00:00:31.529> created<00:00:32.130> using<00:00:32.369> the<00:00:32.850> three<00:00:33.630> stitch

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
are created using the three stitch

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.959 
are created using the three stitch
ribbed<00:00:34.380> cable<00:00:34.770> so<00:00:35.070> that<00:00:35.370> is<00:00:35.550> the<00:00:35.670> cable<00:00:35.820> that

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
ribbed cable so that is the cable that

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.200 
ribbed cable so that is the cable that
I'm<00:00:36.120> going<00:00:36.270> to<00:00:36.329> demonstrate<00:00:36.510> for<00:00:36.960> you<00:00:37.079> today

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:38.210 
I'm going to demonstrate for you today

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:40.250 
I'm going to demonstrate for you today
so<00:00:39.210> if<00:00:39.300> you<00:00:39.360> take<00:00:39.540> a<00:00:39.600> look<00:00:39.840> here<00:00:40.020> on<00:00:40.079> this

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
so if you take a look here on this

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.440 
so if you take a look here on this
little<00:00:40.530> swatch<00:00:40.770> this<00:00:41.340> is<00:00:41.610> the<00:00:41.879> three<00:00:42.149> stitch

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
little swatch this is the three stitch

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.290 
little swatch this is the three stitch
cable<00:00:43.379> and<00:00:43.800> we<00:00:44.309> call<00:00:44.489> it<00:00:44.610> a<00:00:44.670> ribbed<00:00:44.850> cable<00:00:45.180> just

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
cable and we call it a ribbed cable just

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.270 
cable and we call it a ribbed cable just
because<00:00:45.600> it's<00:00:45.780> a<00:00:45.870> simple<00:00:46.260> knit<00:00:46.590> purl<00:00:47.100> knit

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
because it's a simple knit purl knit

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.110 
because it's a simple knit purl knit
stitch<00:00:48.000> and<00:00:48.329> it's<00:00:49.050> set<00:00:49.379> in<00:00:49.649> between<00:00:50.160> a<00:00:50.430> series

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
stitch and it's set in between a series

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.689 
stitch and it's set in between a series
of<00:00:51.149> purl<00:00:51.510> stitches<00:00:51.870> so<00:00:52.469> it<00:00:52.620> will<00:00:52.800> kind<00:00:53.219> of<00:00:53.399> act

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
of purl stitches so it will kind of act

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.380 
of purl stitches so it will kind of act
as<00:00:54.030> a<00:00:54.510> rib<00:00:54.989> stitch<00:00:55.789> but<00:00:56.789> if<00:00:56.910> you<00:00:57.000> take<00:00:57.149> a<00:00:57.180> look

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
as a rib stitch but if you take a look

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:03.520 
as a rib stitch but if you take a look
here<00:00:58.129> it's<00:00:59.129> actually<00:01:01.640> grab<00:01:02.640> a<00:01:02.670> needle<00:01:03.059> here

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.530 
here it's actually grab a needle here

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.679 
here it's actually grab a needle here
this<00:01:04.530> is<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:04.830> first<00:01:05.010> knit<00:01:05.280> stitch<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:06.479> purl

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
this is the first knit stitch the purl

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.420 
this is the first knit stitch the purl
stitch<00:01:06.900> is<00:01:07.200> in<00:01:07.229> between<00:01:07.439> here<00:01:07.920> kind<00:01:08.130> of<00:01:08.189> in<00:01:08.310> the

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
stitch is in between here kind of in the

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.030 
stitch is in between here kind of in the
ditch<00:01:08.700> and<00:01:09.030> then<00:01:09.960> the<00:01:10.140> next<00:01:10.409> knit<00:01:10.590> stitch<00:01:10.830> is

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
ditch and then the next knit stitch is

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.910 
ditch and then the next knit stitch is
crossing<00:01:11.880> over<00:01:12.119> the<00:01:12.570> first<00:01:12.780> net<00:01:13.020> stitch<00:01:13.290> so

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
crossing over the first net stitch so

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.070 
crossing over the first net stitch so
there's<00:01:14.100> always<00:01:14.310> going<00:01:14.610> to<00:01:14.729> be<00:01:14.880> a<00:01:15.240> little<00:01:15.509> purl

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
there's always going to be a little purl

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.980 
there's always going to be a little purl
stitch<00:01:16.500> in<00:01:16.830> the<00:01:17.100> center<00:01:17.490> of<00:01:17.520> our<00:01:17.729> cables<00:01:18.150> so<00:01:18.960> I

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
stitch in the center of our cables so I

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.560 
stitch in the center of our cables so I
will<00:01:19.200> show<00:01:19.350> you<00:01:19.409> how<00:01:19.590> to<00:01:19.650> do<00:01:19.830> this<00:01:20.009> and<00:01:20.450> in<00:01:21.450> the

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
will show you how to do this and in the

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.570 
will show you how to do this and in the
pattern<00:01:21.750> I<00:01:22.049> explain<00:01:22.409> how<00:01:22.590> to<00:01:22.650> do<00:01:22.830> it<00:01:22.979> using<00:01:23.130> a

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
pattern I explain how to do it using a

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.940 
pattern I explain how to do it using a
cable<00:01:24.150> needle<00:01:24.270> but<00:01:24.600> there<00:01:24.810> is<00:01:24.960> a<00:01:25.200> far<00:01:25.920> better

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
cable needle but there is a far better

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.730 
cable needle but there is a far better
way<00:01:26.280> an<00:01:26.729> easier<00:01:27.119> way<00:01:27.270> to<00:01:27.299> do<00:01:27.570> it<00:01:27.720> without<00:01:28.290> any

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
way an easier way to do it without any

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.230 
way an easier way to do it without any
cable<00:01:29.130> needles<00:01:29.430> just<00:01:29.579> a<00:01:29.729> way<00:01:29.820> of<00:01:29.939> rearranging

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
cable needles just a way of rearranging

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.539 
cable needles just a way of rearranging
the<00:01:30.720> stitches<00:01:31.200> all<00:01:31.530> three<00:01:31.740> of<00:01:31.860> them<00:01:32.040> on<00:01:32.250> your

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
the stitches all three of them on your

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.069 
the stitches all three of them on your
left<00:01:32.759> hand<00:01:32.970> needle<00:01:33.299> and<00:01:33.420> then<00:01:33.600> reen<00:01:33.840> itting

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
left hand needle and then reen itting

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:35.660 
left hand needle and then reen itting
them<00:01:34.229> so<00:01:34.829> I'll<00:01:34.920> show<00:01:35.100> you<00:01:35.130> both<00:01:35.340> of<00:01:35.400> those

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
them so I'll show you both of those

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.010 
them so I'll show you both of those
methods<00:01:37.970> so<00:01:38.970> here<00:01:39.210> we<00:01:39.299> are<00:01:39.329> to<00:01:39.600> our<00:01:39.689> three

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
methods so here we are to our three

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.100 
methods so here we are to our three
stitches<00:01:40.350> of<00:01:40.710> our<00:01:40.860> cable<00:01:41.280> and<00:01:41.899> the<00:01:42.899> way<00:01:43.049> you

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
stitches of our cable and the way you

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.560 
stitches of our cable and the way you
need<00:01:43.590> to<00:01:43.890> perform<00:01:44.490> this<00:01:44.700> cable<00:01:45.149> with<00:01:45.360> your

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
need to perform this cable with your

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:53.980 
and you can see we did the exact same

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:56.909 
and you can see we did the exact same
thing<00:05:54.639> on<00:05:54.910> these<00:05:55.419> last<00:05:55.690> two<00:05:55.960> cables<00:05:56.380> as<00:05:56.620> we<00:05:56.770> did

00:05:56.909 --> 00:05:56.919 
thing on these last two cables as we did

00:05:56.919 --> 00:05:58.760 
thing on these last two cables as we did
on<00:05:57.010> the<00:05:57.130> first<00:05:57.310> one<00:05:57.550> and<00:05:57.730> they<00:05:57.790> look<00:05:58.000> identical

00:05:58.760 --> 00:05:58.770 
on the first one and they look identical

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:01.500 
on the first one and they look identical
so<00:05:59.770> that's<00:06:00.310> just<00:06:00.460> an<00:06:00.639> easier<00:06:01.000> way<00:06:01.240> of

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:01.510 
so that's just an easier way of

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:03.900 
so that's just an easier way of
performing<00:06:01.900> this<00:06:02.230> this<00:06:02.680> particular<00:06:03.310> cable

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:03.910 
performing this this particular cable

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:07.950 
performing this this particular cable
without<00:06:04.510> the<00:06:04.810> use<00:06:04.990> of<00:06:05.020> a<00:06:05.620> cable<00:06:06.190> needle<00:06:06.340> I<00:06:06.960> hope

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:07.960 
without the use of a cable needle I hope

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:13.890 
without the use of a cable needle I hope
this<00:06:08.139> helps<00:06:08.410> you

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:13.900
