tried it with goblins and stuff like

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:37.370 
tried it with goblins and stuff like
that<00:01:35.670> the<00:01:36.360> way<00:01:36.509> they've<00:01:36.780> upgraded<00:01:36.960> though

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
that the way they've upgraded though

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.109

though it's a lot harder now

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:40.910 
though it's a lot harder now
so<00:01:39.450> I<00:01:39.479> recommend<00:01:39.840> going<00:01:40.140> with<00:01:40.259> dragons<00:01:40.799> even

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.350 
so I recommend going with dragons even
if<00:01:41.100> you<00:01:41.189> have<00:01:41.310> one<00:01:41.490> star<00:01:41.700> dragons<00:01:42.090> you<00:01:42.210> could

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
if you have one star dragons you could

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.200 
if you have one star dragons you could
do<00:01:42.420> it<00:01:42.539> with<00:01:42.659> rage<00:01:42.869> spells<00:01:43.259> I<00:01:43.439> believe<00:01:43.740> so<00:01:44.610> get

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
do it with rage spells I believe so get

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.730 
do it with rage spells I believe so get
those<00:01:45.360> dragons<00:01:45.630> if<00:01:45.960> you<00:01:46.049> want<00:01:46.229> to<00:01:46.289> be<00:01:46.380> pekka's

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.389 
quick I need to train some troops first
apparently<00:02:07.140> let<00:02:07.380> me<00:02:07.439> just<00:02:07.619> get<00:02:07.740> one<00:02:07.950> so<00:02:08.160> we<00:02:08.280> can

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
apparently let me just get one so we can

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.559 
apparently let me just get one so we can
go<00:02:08.549> see<00:02:09.030> what<00:02:09.149> it<00:02:09.209> looks<00:02:09.360> like<00:02:09.509> I<00:02:11.360> haven't<00:02:12.360> seen

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
go see what it looks like I haven't seen

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:16.880 
go see what it looks like I haven't seen
it<00:02:12.750> I<00:02:14.480> know<00:02:15.480> they've<00:02:15.750> upgraded<00:02:15.930> it<00:02:16.349> too<00:02:16.530> so<00:02:16.799> it

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
it I know they've upgraded it too so it

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.610 
it I know they've upgraded it too so it
looks<00:02:17.069> different<00:02:17.130> oh<00:02:17.989> wow<00:02:18.989> they<00:02:19.230> got<00:02:19.349> a<00:02:19.410> bunch

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
looks different oh wow they got a bunch

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:20.750 
looks different oh wow they got a bunch
of<00:02:19.769> air<00:02:19.890> defenses<00:02:20.400> here

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
of air defenses here

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.330 
of air defenses here
I<00:02:21.380> think<00:02:22.380> the<00:02:22.440> tricky<00:02:22.739> part<00:02:22.950> is<00:02:23.010> gonna<00:02:23.160> be

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
I think the tricky part is gonna be

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.009 
I think the tricky part is gonna be
taking<00:02:23.670> out<00:02:23.760> the<00:02:23.880> air<00:02:24.030> defenses<00:02:24.450> in<00:02:24.720> order<00:02:24.900> to

00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:25.019 
taking out the air defenses in order to

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:29.690 
taking out the air defenses in order to
beat<00:02:25.170> this<00:02:25.290> one<00:02:28.220> yeah<00:02:29.220> with<00:02:29.370> all<00:02:29.400> the<00:02:29.579> air

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
beat this one yeah with all the air

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:30.920 
beat this one yeah with all the air
defenses<00:02:30.060> in<00:02:30.209> here<00:02:30.359> I'm<00:02:30.450> definitely<00:02:30.780> gonna

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
defenses in here I'm definitely gonna

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.229 
defenses in here I'm definitely gonna
want<00:02:31.200> to<00:02:31.260> go<00:02:31.320> with<00:02:31.470> with<00:02:31.739> ground<00:02:32.040> troops<00:02:32.250> so<00:02:33.209> I

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:33.239 
want to go with with ground troops so I

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:35.210 
want to go with with ground troops so I
think<00:02:33.359> I'm<00:02:33.690> going<00:02:33.900> to<00:02:34.079> attack<00:02:34.440> with<00:02:34.470> giants

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
think I'm going to attack with giants

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.780 
think I'm going to attack with giants
instead<00:02:35.850> just<00:02:36.780> a<00:02:36.959> bunch<00:02:37.290> of<00:02:37.410> giants<00:02:37.769> and<00:02:37.950> then

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
instead just a bunch of giants and then

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.059 
instead just a bunch of giants and then
have<00:02:39.000> archers<00:02:39.420> just<00:02:39.720> in<00:02:39.840> case<00:02:40.049> I'm<00:02:40.650> gonna<00:02:40.829> put

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:41.069 
have archers just in case I'm gonna put

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:44.120 
have archers just in case I'm gonna put
I<00:02:41.870> guess<00:02:42.870> over<00:02:43.140> here<00:02:43.290> giants<00:02:43.739> and<00:02:43.890> then<00:02:44.010> up

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
I guess over here giants and then up

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:48.530 
I guess over here giants and then up
here<00:02:44.160> giants<00:02:44.579> and<00:02:44.910> then<00:02:45.060> maybe<00:02:47.060> yeah<00:02:48.060> I<00:02:48.329> think

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
here giants and then maybe yeah I think

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:49.729 
here giants and then maybe yeah I think
that's<00:02:48.870> the<00:02:49.019> only<00:02:49.049> place<00:02:49.350> I<00:02:49.440> want<00:02:49.560> to<00:02:49.590> put

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739 
that's the only place I want to put

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:51.860 
that's the only place I want to put
those<00:02:49.829> giants<00:02:50.190> in<00:02:50.250> order<00:02:50.459> to<00:02:50.549> beat<00:02:50.700> it<00:02:50.870> so

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
those giants in order to beat it so

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.229 
those giants in order to beat it so
hopefully<00:02:52.709> we<00:02:53.310> can<00:02:53.459> beat<00:02:53.609> this<00:02:53.760> one<00:02:53.910> next<00:02:54.120> time

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
hopefully we can beat this one next time

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:56.629 
hopefully we can beat this one next time
we<00:02:54.420> go<00:02:54.569> for<00:02:54.600> it<00:02:54.900> and<00:02:55.079> I<00:02:55.200> will<00:02:55.260> see<00:02:55.470> you<00:02:55.560> guys<00:02:55.709> at
