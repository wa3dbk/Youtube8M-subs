Remington<00:02:04.470> curling<00:02:04.709> one<00:02:05.069> I<00:02:05.310> used<00:02:05.610> the<00:02:05.940> one<00:02:06.330> to

00:02:06.559 --> 00:02:06.569 
Remington curling one I used the one to

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:08.600

one<00:02:06.750> and<00:02:06.869> a<00:02:06.959> half<00:02:07.110> inch<00:02:07.440> and<00:02:07.649> this<00:02:08.160> just<00:02:08.369> makes

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
one and a half inch and this just makes

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.639 
one and a half inch and this just makes
more<00:02:08.819> of<00:02:08.880> waves<00:02:09.270> instead<00:02:09.660> of<00:02:09.869> curls<00:02:10.259> so<00:02:10.619> it's

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
more of waves instead of curls so it's

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:15.110
