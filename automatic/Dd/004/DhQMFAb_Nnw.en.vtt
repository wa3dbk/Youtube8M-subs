and I gripped their hand around that and
it<00:01:54.090> you<00:01:54.479> know<00:01:54.600> it<00:01:54.689> looks<00:01:54.720> just<00:01:54.990> like<00:01:55.549> the

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
it you know it looks just like the

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.760

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
better but uh I thought I work pretty

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.710 
better but uh I thought I work pretty
well<00:02:08.090> so<00:02:09.009> it<00:02:10.009> can<00:02:10.280> be<00:02:10.460> under<00:02:10.789> slung<00:02:11.030> both<00:02:11.300> guns

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
well so it can be under slung both guns

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.700 
well so it can be under slung both guns
can<00:02:11.960> be<00:02:11.990> under<00:02:12.380> so<00:02:12.500> long<00:02:13.060> without<00:02:14.060> any

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:14.710 
can be under so long without any

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:22.450 
can be under so long without any
addition<00:02:15.710> to<00:02:16.400> the<00:02:16.550> plastic<00:02:16.760> at<00:02:17.150> all<00:02:17.290> so<00:02:21.280> and<00:02:22.280> if

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:22.460 
addition to the plastic at all so and if

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:23.740 
addition to the plastic at all so and if
you<00:02:22.580> can<00:02:22.700> see<00:02:22.880> this<00:02:23.030> actually<00:02:23.480> sticking

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
you can see this actually sticking

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:28.510 
you can see this actually sticking
pretty<00:02:24.050> good<00:02:24.320> the<00:02:24.680> trick<00:02:24.890> is<00:02:25.100> to<00:02:25.370> come<00:02:27.190> in<00:02:28.190> with

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:28.520 
pretty good the trick is to come in with

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:30.820 
pretty good the trick is to come in with
the<00:02:28.700> come<00:02:29.510> in<00:02:29.690> with<00:02:29.870> the<00:02:29.959> gun<00:02:30.110> like<00:02:30.320> this<00:02:30.350> and

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830 
the come in with the gun like this and

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:34.690 
the come in with the gun like this and
get<00:02:31.280> it<00:02:31.570> behind<00:02:32.570> his<00:02:33.080> thumb<00:02:33.410> and<00:02:33.709> then<00:02:34.160> pull<00:02:34.670> it

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
get it behind his thumb and then pull it

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.330 
get it behind his thumb and then pull it
down<00:02:35.000> and<00:02:35.300> wedges<00:02:35.980> that's<00:02:36.980> like<00:02:37.130> a<00:02:37.160> little

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
down and wedges that's like a little

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:38.770 
down and wedges that's like a little
tiny<00:02:37.490> stress<00:02:37.820> on<00:02:38.000> his<00:02:38.180> thumb<00:02:38.420> but<00:02:38.600> not

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
tiny stress on his thumb but not

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:40.270 
tiny stress on his thumb but not
watching<00:02:39.170> me<00:02:39.260> it's<00:02:39.380> not<00:02:39.470> bad<00:02:39.739> and<00:02:40.100> the<00:02:40.160> other

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
watching me it's not bad and the other

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.010 
watching me it's not bad and the other
one<00:02:40.459> I<00:02:40.700> don't<00:02:41.180> think<00:02:41.239> there's<00:02:41.480> any<00:02:41.600> stress<00:02:41.870> at

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:42.020 
one I don't think there's any stress at

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:46.000 
one I don't think there's any stress at
all<00:02:42.610> so<00:02:43.959> this<00:02:44.959> is<00:02:45.080> what<00:02:45.230> it<00:02:45.320> ended<00:02:45.530> up<00:02:45.620> looking

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
all so this is what it ended up looking

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:50.920 
all so this is what it ended up looking
like<00:02:46.190> I<00:02:46.520> cut<00:02:46.790> off<00:02:46.910> the<00:02:49.060> tab<00:02:50.060> here<00:02:50.510> I<00:02:50.570> cut<00:02:50.810> off

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
like I cut off the tab here I cut off

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:54.270 
like I cut off the tab here I cut off
the<00:02:50.959> arm<00:02:51.290> that<00:02:51.500> came<00:02:51.739> out<00:02:51.950> and<00:02:52.130> supported<00:02:52.340> it

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
the arm that came out and supported it

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.260 
the arm that came out and supported it
you<00:02:55.280> know<00:02:55.400> it<00:02:55.489> looks<00:02:55.550> pretty<00:02:55.880> cool<00:02:56.060> like<00:02:56.239> that

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:56.270 
you know it looks pretty cool like that

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:02.040 
you know it looks pretty cool like that
too<00:02:56.630> so<00:02:57.020> I<00:02:58.870> can<00:02:59.870> see<00:03:00.020> why<00:03:00.320> people<00:03:00.350> add<00:03:00.739> the<00:03:00.860> peg

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:02.050 
too so I can see why people add the peg

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:05.170 
too so I can see why people add the peg
but<00:03:03.280> I'm<00:03:04.280> more<00:03:04.400> comfortable<00:03:04.549> with<00:03:04.910> it<00:03:05.030> the<00:03:05.120> way

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
but I'm more comfortable with it the way

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:12.460 
but I'm more comfortable with it the way
