sixty<00:01:42.030> dollars<00:01:42.420> and<00:01:42.720> while<00:01:42.899> most<00:01:43.170> of<00:01:43.380> those

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
sixty dollars and while most of those

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:44.840 
sixty dollars and while most of those
titles<00:01:43.799> might<00:01:43.950> be<00:01:44.070> worth<00:01:44.250> it<00:01:44.430> there<00:01:44.729> were<00:01:44.820> a

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
titles might be worth it there were a

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.639 
titles might be worth it there were a
few<00:01:44.939> on<00:01:45.270> that<00:01:45.420> list<00:01:45.600> which<00:01:45.810> should<00:01:46.049> retail<00:01:46.439> no

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
few on that list which should retail no

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.560 
few on that list which should retail no
more<00:01:46.890> than<00:01:47.100> forty<00:01:47.399> dollars<00:01:47.759> or<00:01:48.090> even<00:01:48.390> more

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
more than forty dollars or even more

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.630 
more than forty dollars or even more
realistically<00:01:49.259> thirty<00:01:49.710> dollars<00:01:50.159> i<00:01:50.399> say

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
realistically thirty dollars i say

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.130 
realistically thirty dollars i say
realistically<00:01:51.030> because<00:01:51.600> any<00:01:51.750> other<00:01:51.990> day

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
realistically because any other day

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.080 
realistically because any other day
these<00:01:52.290> titles<00:01:52.649> would<00:01:52.770> be<00:01:52.890> bargain<00:01:53.340> titles<00:01:53.759> but

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
these titles would be bargain titles but

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.310 
these titles would be bargain titles but
since<00:01:54.299> it's<00:01:54.450> a<00:01:54.509> launch<00:01:54.750> game<00:01:55.020> they<00:01:55.170> could

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
since it's a launch game they could

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.929 
since it's a launch game they could
charge<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:55.710> higher<00:01:55.829> price<00:01:56.100> but<00:01:56.670> i<00:01:56.700> think

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
charge the higher price but i think

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.850 
charge the higher price but i think
nintendo<00:01:57.360> and<00:01:57.570> game<00:01:57.810> party<00:01:58.320> champions

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
nintendo and game party champions

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.249 
nintendo and game party champions
wipeout<00:01:59.310> 3<00:01:59.520> and<00:01:59.820> even<00:02:00.060> scribblenauts<00:02:00.810> should

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
wipeout 3 and even scribblenauts should

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.080 
wipeout 3 and even scribblenauts should
be<00:02:01.350> in<00:02:01.439> that<00:02:01.530> lower<00:02:01.740> price<00:02:02.100> range<00:02:02.460> I<00:02:02.759> hope<00:02:02.969> the

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
be in that lower price range I hope the

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.429 
be in that lower price range I hope the
publishers<00:02:03.509> all<00:02:03.600> over<00:02:03.780> their<00:02:03.899> price<00:02:04.079> fairly

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
publishers all over their price fairly

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:05.929 
publishers all over their price fairly
quickly<00:02:04.680> but<00:02:05.040> again<00:02:05.369> that's<00:02:05.579> just<00:02:05.759> my<00:02:05.909> opinion

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
quickly but again that's just my opinion

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:08.059 
quickly but again that's just my opinion
what<00:02:06.719> do<00:02:06.780> you<00:02:06.899> guys<00:02:07.049> think<00:02:07.110> but<00:02:07.740> that's<00:02:07.890> all

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
what do you guys think but that's all

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:09.680
