00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.410 
it will be crazy
so<00:02:07.799> the<00:02:07.920> through<00:02:08.039> they<00:02:08.160> added<00:02:08.459> was<00:02:08.759> the<00:02:09.179> bank

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
so the through they added was the bank

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.809 
so the through they added was the bank
the<00:02:10.020> temple<00:02:10.410> and<00:02:10.619> the<00:02:10.770> wizard<00:02:11.039> tower<00:02:11.190> and<00:02:11.520> they

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
the temple and the wizard tower and they

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:12.979 
the temple and the wizard tower and they
added<00:02:11.970> in<00:02:12.209> the<00:02:12.239> middle<00:02:12.540> I<00:02:12.599> don't<00:02:12.629> know<00:02:12.810> what

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
added in the middle I don't know what

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:13.580 
added in the middle I don't know what
the<00:02:13.200> deal<00:02:13.379> is

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
the deal is

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.800 
the deal is
that<00:02:13.800> but<00:02:14.099> I<00:02:14.310> guess<00:02:14.640> it<00:02:14.790> made<00:02:15.000> the<00:02:15.239> the<00:02:15.569> bottom

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
that but I guess it made the the bottom

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.750 
that but I guess it made the the bottom
three<00:02:15.989> more<00:02:16.170> they've<00:02:16.830> made<00:02:17.099> it<00:02:17.220> stronger<00:02:17.459> and

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
three more they've made it stronger and

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.640 
three more they've made it stronger and
all<00:02:18.060> that<00:02:18.450> good<00:02:18.569> stuff<00:02:18.629> so<00:02:19.349> you<00:02:19.440> need<00:02:19.560> to<00:02:19.620> just

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
all that good stuff so you need to just

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.240 
all that good stuff so you need to just
go<00:02:19.890> through<00:02:20.480> by<00:02:21.480> the<00:02:21.540> upgrades<00:02:21.959> on<00:02:22.349> the<00:02:23.099> new

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
go through by the upgrades on the new

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
upgrades for each building added a bunch

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.500 
upgrades for each building added a bunch
of<00:02:32.040> cookies<00:02:32.430> and<00:02:32.790> the<00:02:33.030> cookies<00:02:33.299> are<00:02:33.450> actually

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
of cookies and the cookies are actually

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:39.619 
of cookies and the cookies are actually
better<00:02:33.870> now<00:02:34.080> I<00:02:34.319> think<00:02:38.060> yeah<00:02:39.060> here<00:02:39.269> you<00:02:39.330> go

00:02:39.619 --> 00:02:39.629 
better now I think yeah here you go

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:42.170 
better now I think yeah here you go
CPS<00:02:40.049> calculations<00:02:40.620> revamped<00:02:41.180> cookie

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
CPS calculations revamped cookie

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.000 
CPS calculations revamped cookie
upgrades<00:02:42.540> now<00:02:42.750> stacked<00:02:43.049> multiplicatively

upgrades now stacked multiplicatively

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:48.110 
upgrades now stacked multiplicatively
meaning<00:02:45.079> it's<00:02:46.079> what's<00:02:47.010> three<00:02:47.519> percent<00:02:47.940> will

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
meaning it's what's three percent will

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.390 
meaning it's what's three percent will
be<00:02:48.150> added<00:02:48.599> to<00:02:48.840> three<00:02:49.410> percent<00:02:49.650> of<00:02:49.980> sixteen

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
be added to three percent of sixteen

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.809 
be added to three percent of sixteen
thousand<00:02:50.940> not<00:02:51.420> just<00:02:52.280> sixteen<00:02:53.280> thousand<00:02:53.700> one

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:53.819 
thousand not just sixteen thousand one

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:55.550 
thousand not just sixteen thousand one
hundred<00:02:53.880> twenty<00:02:54.060> eight<00:02:54.360> percent<00:02:54.510> so<00:02:55.290> when<00:02:55.530> I

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
hundred twenty eight percent so when I

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.030 
hundred twenty eight percent so when I
