00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:19.020
 hate crime mexico and in this video 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.699
 there are five tips I give if 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.650
 before you bring girls to write 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.750
 The five gb stand would relate 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.800
 but excluding also the internet 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.599
 If you are for example with a 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.279
 girl on facebook on whatsapp or 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.750
 Something else somehow now writes 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.130
 not so real but if you are 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.050
 just on the spot just with girls so over 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.670
 facebook or whatsapp or other too 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.510
 I'll write five today 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.280
 advice for you 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.989
 and I do not want to say that now 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.120
 now necessarily the biggest women 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.950
 I'm uproarious and the biggest in everything 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.899
 plan but I will now in three 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.190
 months 18 and I think that the 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.629
 Most of my viewers or I know 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.550
 that most of my audience is watching 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.930
 are a lot younger to 13 14 that 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.449
 just in the age where you then 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.129
 So it started with girls 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.600
 to write and I remember back then 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.800
 when I was that age I would have me 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.090
 definitely wished that someone 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.320
 He gives me tips and can give 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.149
 That's why I thought today, I give you 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.070
 Just give my five tips if you like 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.750
 to write in advance with mails and 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.100
 above all else, or above all before 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.750
 the girls also have to clarify 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.040
 we say it this way and yes would 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.540
 I say just start with it 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.159
 my first tip and my first tip 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.680
 is definitely not too often writes 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.750
 So people it captures the girl that yes 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.830
 word not bad too so if you're with 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.119
 she writes to the girl and she writes 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.430
 you do not write directly then he does not 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.720
 5000 messages because then no idea 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.040
 people because you annoy the girl easy 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.049
 only you have to the girl so synonymous 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.310
 can wriggle bit so clear her 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.750
 you have to show that you are a girl 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.070
 but be of interest that is easy 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.119
 so that more complicated at the girls 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.650
 at the same time you have to be one 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.420
 Fidget a bit and him too 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.590
 show that we not only them but 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.880
 the 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.679
 which is also interested in you 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.000
 and that you are not just any girl 

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:42.509
 afterwards you run like that if you understand what 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.859
 I mean 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.000
 means in any case if you with the 

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:46.140
 You do not write like that 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.609
 often but you also like to leave it that way 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.719
 fidget a bit and there you can 

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:50.310
 namely directly to the next point 

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:51.780
 and not always directly back 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.119
 Write knows if he girl with a 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.439
 writes and she does not know 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.270
 after two minutes then again 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.770
 There is no idea that does not make the 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.929
 We would now have reactions from cod 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.369
 knows about your cell phone and writes immediately 

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:03.090
 back but also like to wait 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.350
 two minutes 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.149
 here should not be no idea 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.619
 somehow the girl for three hours 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:09.030
 let's wait then shit world 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.470
 then the girl comes 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.459
 uninteresting before you have to 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.840
 show that you are in the girl 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:14.220
 but really does not care 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.540
 permanently write back wait quietly 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.799
 also like two minutes if you 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.480
 you wrote because if you 

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:20.310
 really permanent at the top and 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.170
 directly no idea if you directly 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.640
 writes back and martin wolf already 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.680
 online waiting for you back 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.000
 writes the not good people is 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.170
 if you write with the girl then 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.579
 Let it be like that for two minutes 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.019
 wait before he writes back 

00:02:29.579 --> 00:02:32.069
 i can only recommend it 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:33.959
 actually always very good at the 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:35.370
 girls because then we just go to the girls 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:36.690
 show that you are not easy to have 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.040
 that they are really many girls 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.019
 could have and that he necessarily me 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.250
 are so interested in her 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:43.109
 if you like them of course 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.760
 But as I said, you want my 

00:02:43.109 --> 00:02:46.170
 second tip in any case not directly 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.250
 write back so and if you ask 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.680
 I looked at it all the time 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.880
 but always so around a notebook where I 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.650
 I always like my video ideas from 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.359
 writes because I'm so mean here five 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.889
 Tips on happen and then we go 

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:57.840
 also directly to my next 

00:02:55.889 --> 00:02:59.220
 and third point and that's what it calls 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.510
 girls under the name underestimate that 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.680
 It's really good that I have now 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:04.200
 again with my girlfriend 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:07.049
 noticed and accepted yours 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.190
 girlfriend does not know berta and 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:10.380
 has his name 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:12.030
 and no I see you is the comments 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:13.919
 my girlfriend is not my name 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.000
 words in any case your friends 

00:03:13.919 --> 00:03:16.769
 or the girl you want 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.910
 is called words so then he writes to 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:20.700
 example then only then drives 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:22.319
 her navi writes the workplace 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:24.269
 the berta pushes how are you today 

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:25.560
 or something like that so called the girl 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:26.880
 Names that is really good 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.889
 I really can only recommend 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:30.630
 and yes when do we go straight to 

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:32.609
 next point to the fourth point to indeed 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:33.840
 try to deepen the conversation 

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:35.849
 as if he writes with the girl like that 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.260
 It used to be at least always, and indeed 

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:39.209
 always wrote yes how are you 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.290
 Today, what are you doing today? 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:42.239
 this evening away in you this 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:43.319
 standard questions and then 34 more questions 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:44.790
 you suddenly did not know anymore 

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:45.280
 what else should one ask against him 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:47.230
 at least 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.220
 Maybe you know the problem and there 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:49.590
 can really only recommend that 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:52.780
 is also really good at girls 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:53.980
 he tries to try the conversation 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:56.380
 to deepen a bit by going to the 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:57.760
 example, yes, no idea in the 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:59.890
 Now just ask out about such a few 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:03.040
 deeper things like, for example, I know 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:04.540
 not no idea ex-friend are to 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.830
 for example always a good topic of 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:06.880
 that was at least one now 

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:08.650
 painful separation then is natural 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:10.270
 not so good topic but that is 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:11.560
 just talk about relationships like that 

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:13.569
 or something a bit deeper so 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:14.800
 emotional topic so that the girl too 

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:16.720
 realizes that you are really rich and 

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:18.549
 that you can talk about everything with you 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:19.690
 and yes, as I said I had 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:21.100
 at least for now the problem 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:22.450
 when I wrote to the girl 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:24.580
 I just did really still a few 

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:25.660
 so ask this standard drop 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:26.950
 the soja how are you today and so on 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:30.850
 I always knew certainly that I 

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:31.870
 should write and therefore tried yes 

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:33.340
 just the topic a bit too 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:34.870
 deepen as I said so maybe over 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:36.280
 relationships and just talk like that 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:37.990
 a little bit of an issue where you just go 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:38.410
 I can only write a long time about it 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:41.020
 recommend 

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:42.490
 and then the last point is what also 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:44.229
 always good with girls arrives and 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:46.419
 Although remember things are accepted 

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:48.160
 you have two days ago or so you 

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:50.380
 written and they told you there 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:51.729
 that she goes to the cinema then no idea 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:54.669
 then he does not sign up 

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:56.110
 So now she is writing 

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:58.090
 again after a day or so 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:59.350
 not just right so that's where we come 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:00.460
 not directly to the second point again 

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:00.940
 After writing , write more time 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:02.590
 back to 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:04.479
 and then he asks her again movie film 

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:06.460
 was because then you show that you 

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:08.110
 really listens to being present and 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:09.190
 yes then just show yourself that you are 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:11.020
 reminds of the things that you are standing 

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:12.640
 could memorize things they do and 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:14.200
 then i just know that you 

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:15.340
 So is interesting, these were my 

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:17.140
 five points as I said last point 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:19.990
 Remember the things they are telling you 

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:21.370
 told and if you have other tips 

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:22.330
 And of course it could also do tricks 

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:23.440
 like to write in the comments 

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:24.820
 and write me also likes to 

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:26.020
 the comments how he instantly 

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:27.280
 said I have not come so often 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:28.660
 you have done it for you until now 

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:29.050
 more and more gta videos for you 

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:30.789
 made 

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:32.050
 As I said, let me have a direct one 

00:05:30.789 --> 00:05:33.620
 if you have the comments with facetime 

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:35.240
 liked 

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:36.440
 I'm just out of here you know 

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:37.910
 what to do is easy for a course 

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:41.620
 seller he is one 

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:41.620
 skin purely people before comics 

00:05:42.170 --> 00:06:02.079
