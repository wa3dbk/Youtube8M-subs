00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
in the final build of the game whether

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.520 
in the final build of the game whether
or<00:01:56.090> not<00:01:56.210> this<00:01:56.360> was<00:01:56.509> a<00:01:56.540> placeholder<00:01:56.840> is<00:01:57.229> unknown

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.530 
or not this was a placeholder is unknown

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:58.929 
or not this was a placeholder is unknown
but<00:01:57.770> if<00:01:57.920> you<00:01:57.979> listen<00:01:58.280> to<00:01:58.310> it<00:01:58.430> it<00:01:58.640> does

00:01:58.929 --> 00:01:58.939 
but if you listen to it it does

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:00.850 
but if you listen to it it does
definitely<00:01:59.270> sound<00:01:59.869> like<00:01:59.990> a<00:02:00.079> placeholder<00:02:00.320> also

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:00.860 
definitely sound like a placeholder also

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:02.050 
definitely sound like a placeholder also
and<00:02:01.100> this<00:02:01.130> is<00:02:01.340> probably<00:02:01.579> the<00:02:01.759> most

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
and this is probably the most

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:03.910 
and this is probably the most
interesting<00:02:02.540> thing<00:02:02.750> regarding<00:02:03.320> the<00:02:03.500> beta<00:02:03.710> of
