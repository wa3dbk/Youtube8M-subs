00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
cool that basically when you switching

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.170 
cool that basically when you switching
cross<00:01:33.479> faders<00:01:34.340> sides<00:01:35.340> of<00:01:35.520> the<00:01:35.610> cross<00:01:35.820> faders

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.950 
cross faders sides of the cross faders
it<00:01:37.110> automatically<00:01:38.000> drops<00:01:39.000> the<00:01:39.210> basin<00:01:39.720> and

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
it automatically drops the basin and

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.100 
it automatically drops the basin and
raises<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:41.430> levels<00:01:41.790> of<00:01:42.000> the<00:01:42.090> other<00:01:42.270> track<00:01:42.720> so

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
raises the levels of the other track so

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.080 
raises the levels of the other track so
basically<00:01:43.619> it's<00:01:44.250> just<00:01:44.490> it's<00:01:44.700> like<00:01:44.850> one<00:01:45.060> of

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
basically it's just it's like one of

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.569 
basically it's just it's like one of
these<00:01:45.360> type<00:01:45.750> things<00:01:46.049> when<00:01:46.320> you<00:01:46.460> mixing<00:01:47.460> the

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
these type things when you mixing the

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.630 
these type things when you mixing the
music<00:01:47.970> you<00:01:48.090> drop<00:01:48.329> the<00:01:48.479> bass<00:01:49.189> and<00:01:50.189> you<00:01:50.430> probably

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
music you drop the bass and you probably

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.990 
music you drop the bass and you probably
raise<00:01:51.060> the<00:01:51.240> base<00:01:51.420> of<00:01:51.630> this<00:01:51.780> one<00:01:52.850> that's<00:01:53.850> what

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
raise the base of this one that's what

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.270 
raise the base of this one that's what
the<00:01:54.240> filter<00:01:54.540> fade<00:01:54.869> button<00:01:55.350> does<00:01:55.950> in<00:01:56.189> a

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
the filter fade button does in a

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.270 
the filter fade button does in a
nutshell<00:01:56.899> it<00:01:57.899> also<00:01:58.170> has<00:01:58.469> it<00:01:58.710> tweaks<00:01:58.950> it<00:01:59.130> with<00:01:59.250> a

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
nutshell it also has it tweaks it with a

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.990 
nutshell it also has it tweaks it with a
little<00:01:59.610> bit<00:01:59.729> of<00:01:59.820> that<00:01:59.909> filter<00:02:00.240> sound<00:02:00.630> also<00:02:00.899> so

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.000 
little bit of that filter sound also so

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.490 
little bit of that filter sound also so
essentially<00:02:03.000> you<00:02:03.149> need<00:02:03.329> three<00:02:03.689> or<00:02:03.719> four<00:02:04.049> four

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
essentially you need three or four four

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.920 
essentially you need three or four four
hands<00:02:05.009> to<00:02:05.100> do<00:02:05.310> what<00:02:05.850> the<00:02:05.969> filter<00:02:06.210> fade<00:02:06.570> button

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
hands to do what the filter fade button

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.589 
hands to do what the filter fade button
does<00:02:07.280> we<00:02:08.280> got<00:02:08.429> the<00:02:08.550> load<00:02:08.819> buttons<00:02:09.179> over<00:02:09.330> here

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
does we got the load buttons over here

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:12.770

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:08.610
