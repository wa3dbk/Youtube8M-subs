8 there are some pieces level 9 I'm not
too<00:02:05.770> worried<00:02:06.069> because<00:02:06.219> her<00:02:06.369> hair<00:02:06.609> is<00:02:06.700> really

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
too worried because her hair is really

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.389 
too worried because her hair is really
strong<00:02:07.239> but<00:02:08.170> I<00:02:08.229> will<00:02:08.440> show<00:02:08.619> you<00:02:08.679> guys<00:02:09.009> what<00:02:09.369> I

strong but I will show you guys what I

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:11.339 
strong but I will show you guys what I
put<00:02:09.700> in<00:02:09.759> their<00:02:09.849> hair<00:02:09.970> just<00:02:10.450> to<00:02:10.569> equalize<00:02:11.140> the

00:02:11.339 --> 00:02:11.349 
put in their hair just to equalize the

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:13.199 
put in their hair just to equalize the
porosity<00:02:11.560> of<00:02:11.800> the<00:02:11.890> hair<00:02:12.099> so<00:02:12.610> that's<00:02:12.730> coming

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:13.209 
porosity of the hair so that's coming

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:15.990 
porosity of the hair so that's coming
right<00:02:13.390> up<00:02:13.630> alright<00:02:14.230> so<00:02:14.500> we're<00:02:14.800> almost<00:02:15.010> done<00:02:15.310> we

right up alright so we're almost done we
are<00:02:16.209> at<00:02:16.450> level<00:02:16.810> 9<00:02:17.020> it's<00:02:17.590> lifting<00:02:17.920> up<00:02:18.040> pretty

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
are at level 9 it's lifting up pretty

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.900 
are at level 9 it's lifting up pretty
fast<00:02:18.490> because<00:02:18.820> I<00:02:18.970> did<00:02:19.350> reapply<00:02:20.350> just

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
fast because I did reapply just

got<00:02:35.340> for<00:02:35.700> the<00:02:35.820> first<00:02:35.850> trial<00:02:36.480> you<00:02:37.470> can<00:02:37.560> see<00:02:37.800> how

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
got for the first trial you can see how

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.240 
got for the first trial you can see how
it's<00:02:38.640> like<00:02:38.910> more<00:02:39.270> yellow<00:02:40.200> here<00:02:40.590> and<00:02:40.620> then<00:02:41.010> here

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
it's like more yellow here and then here

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.220 
it's like more yellow here and then here
gets<00:02:41.490> more<00:02:41.700> orange<00:02:42.120> so<00:02:42.630> this<00:02:42.810> is<00:02:42.960> where<00:02:43.110> it

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
gets more orange so this is where it

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.800

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
got to do one more session and again you

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.490 
got to do one more session and again you
want<00:02:47.880> to<00:02:48.000> use<00:02:48.060> a<00:02:48.240> low<00:02:48.600> developer<00:02:49.200> because

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
want to use a low developer because

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.200 
want to use a low developer because
again<00:02:49.830> you<00:02:50.100> want<00:02:50.310> to<00:02:50.430> watch<00:02:50.940> out<00:02:51.180> for

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:51.210 
again you want to watch out for

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:52.850 
again you want to watch out for
integrity<00:02:52.110> of<00:02:52.260> the<00:02:52.350> hair<00:02:52.530> you<00:02:52.620> want<00:02:52.650> to<00:02:52.800> make

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
integrity of the hair you want to make

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.530 
integrity of the hair you want to make
sure<00:02:53.070> that<00:02:53.250> she<00:02:53.460> walks<00:02:53.670> out<00:02:53.820> with<00:02:53.880> nice<00:02:54.300> hair

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
sure that she walks out with nice hair

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.020 
sure that she walks out with nice hair
when<00:02:54.750> she's<00:02:54.900> done<00:02:55.310> so<00:02:56.310> we're<00:02:56.460> gonna<00:02:56.580> do<00:02:56.730> one

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
when she's done so we're gonna do one

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.680 
when she's done so we're gonna do one
more<00:02:57.180> time

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
more time

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.180 
more time
I<00:02:57.720> wouldn't<00:02:58.110> recommend<00:02:58.260> doing<00:02:58.680> it<00:02:58.830> another

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
I wouldn't recommend doing it another

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:00.620 
I wouldn't recommend doing it another
because<00:02:59.550> you're<00:02:59.670> going<00:02:59.760> to<00:02:59.820> over<00:03:00.150> process<00:03:00.360> the

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
because you're going to over process the

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:03.110 
because you're going to over process the
hair<00:03:00.840> and<00:03:01.170> that<00:03:01.860> will<00:03:01.980> ruin<00:03:02.100> the<00:03:02.190> porosity<00:03:02.430> but

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
hair and that will ruin the porosity but

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.020 
hair and that will ruin the porosity but
I<00:03:03.740> can<00:03:04.740> see<00:03:05.040> already<00:03:05.220> that<00:03:05.580> it's<00:03:05.760> already

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
I can see already that it's already

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.540 
I can see already that it's already
almost<00:03:06.240> there<00:03:06.690> so<00:03:06.990> we<00:03:07.290> should<00:03:07.470> be<00:03:07.500> okay<00:03:07.800> you

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:08.550 
almost there so we should be okay you

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:10.550 
almost there so we should be okay you
can<00:03:08.730> see<00:03:08.970> the<00:03:09.330> true<00:03:09.540> tone<00:03:09.810> when<00:03:10.110> it's<00:03:10.260> dry<00:03:10.530> so

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
can see the true tone when it's dry so

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.710 
can see the true tone when it's dry so
it<00:03:10.950> does<00:03:11.250> have<00:03:11.520> quite<00:03:11.820> a<00:03:11.880> bit<00:03:12.030> of<00:03:12.120> orange<00:03:12.270> still

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
it does have quite a bit of orange still

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.110 
it does have quite a bit of orange still
which<00:03:13.470> is<00:03:13.920> going<00:03:14.160> to<00:03:14.250> be<00:03:14.340> the<00:03:14.460> toughest<00:03:14.820> remove

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
which is going to be the toughest remove

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.600 
which is going to be the toughest remove
so<00:03:15.330> I'm<00:03:15.600> going<00:03:15.840> to<00:03:15.900> go<00:03:16.050> ahead<00:03:16.530> and<00:03:17.010> do<00:03:17.580> another

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:17.610 
so I'm going to go ahead and do another

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:21.050 
so I'm going to go ahead and do another
session<00:03:18.180> with<00:03:18.630> a<00:03:19.380> lower<00:03:19.680> developer<00:03:20.430> to<00:03:20.910> make

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
session with a lower developer to make

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:45.410 
yellow which is exactly what I want but
the<00:03:43.709> only<00:03:43.830> resistant<00:03:44.610> part<00:03:44.790> is<00:03:44.970> the<00:03:45.120> bottom

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 
the only resistant part is the bottom

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.000 
the only resistant part is the bottom
right<00:03:45.570> here<00:03:45.690> which<00:03:45.870> is<00:03:46.050> normal<00:03:46.410> at<00:03:46.500> the<00:03:46.590> ends

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
right here which is normal at the ends

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:48.830 
right here which is normal at the ends
the<00:03:47.520> reason<00:03:47.790> being<00:03:47.970> is<00:03:48.150> because<00:03:48.209> she<00:03:48.540> has<00:03:48.630> more

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
the reason being is because she has more

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.290 
the reason being is because she has more
heat<00:03:49.050> on<00:03:49.230> the<00:03:49.560> head<00:03:49.739> so<00:03:50.340> it's<00:03:50.640> lifting<00:03:51.120> the

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:51.300 
heat on the head so it's lifting the

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:54.080 
heat on the head so it's lifting the
hair<00:03:51.720> color<00:03:51.959> here<00:03:52.290> more<00:03:52.709> res<00:03:53.430> this<00:03:53.580> one<00:03:53.820> has

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
hair color here more res this one has

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:55.370 
hair color here more res this one has
less<00:03:54.300> heat<00:03:54.480> so<00:03:54.660> I'm<00:03:54.810> just<00:03:54.959> keeping<00:03:55.260> this

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:55.380 
less heat so I'm just keeping this

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:58.190 
less heat so I'm just keeping this
covered<00:03:55.920> that<00:03:56.250> way<00:03:56.400> it<00:03:56.700> stays<00:03:57.270> saturated<00:03:57.989> and

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
covered that way it stays saturated and

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.290 
covered that way it stays saturated and
stays<00:03:58.440> moist<00:03:58.739> so<00:03:59.550> I<00:03:59.610> want<00:03:59.820> it<00:03:59.940> to<00:04:00.060> fully

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:00.300 
stays moist so I want it to fully

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:02.870 
stays moist so I want it to fully
develop<00:04:00.570> for<00:04:01.110> the<00:04:01.140> full<00:04:01.440> development<00:04:01.770> time<00:04:02.160> so
