00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:05.280
Welcome to California Gardening!

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:08.000
In today's
episode we will look at two

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.160
determinate tomato varieties that you can
easily grow in containers

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:17.300
so the first variety of tomato we will
look at is called Better Bush

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:20.380
So we started our tomato
plants in February

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:23.970
and it's always recommend that you
start your tomatoes

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.020
after the last frost date in your area

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.760
So as you can see here as the plant started growing

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.840
It did
show a lot of

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:36.090
vigorous growth you can see all the

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.899
nice and big stems and lush leaves

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.850
here and then as the plant grows older

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.079
it started producing these little
tomatoes

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:51.520
now at this stage if you remember my tip
 from my previous videos

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:55.949
you need to stop giving a nitrogen rich
fertilizer to the plant

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:01.050
this will enable the plants to
concentrate their energy on

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.489
building these nice big tomatoes
that you see here

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:08.880
by May this plant had produced

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:11.939
a lot of big tomatoes as you can see
here

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.159
and the plant was showing great growth

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:16.279
with no signs of diseases

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.680
The tomato that you see here is
ripened on the vine

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.040
this is the better bush variety of tomato

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:27.799
and we're gonna go ahead
and harvest

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:30.820
this nice, red and juicy tomato

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:34.490
so let's see how this fruit looks like

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.369
So as you can see the fruit looks pretty
solid and nice

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:43.140
and apart from a little bit of
crackling that you can see

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.390
the fruit is pretty good now you can
also

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:52.079
let the tomatoes ripen on your shelf at
room temperatures

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:57.090
now as you can see here these are the tomatoes
that were produced by this plant

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.590
and overall this tomato looks really
good

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.750
the texture is good and inside you can see
that

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:07.730
there's a lot of flesh so you can use

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:12.590
up this kind of a tomato for slicing
preparing sandwiches

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.310
or using it in salads, it's all good

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.200
now what I loved about this tomato plant was that

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.340
not only was the fruit
almost perfect

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.280
without any signs of
damage on the skin

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:30.600
it was also very delicious and vine
ripened tomatoes are

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:35.560
anyway very nice but this but this variety
is an absolutely delicious tomato

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.130
now the next variety of tomato
that we will look at today

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:44.530
is called Container's Choice this is a great
determinate tomato variety

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:47.770
that's easily available at your local
garden stores

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:51.620
and this was also started in the
month of Feb

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:56.800
now this is another very prolific tomato
variety that

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:00.180
you can grow in your garden in
containers

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.790
and overall I think this plant was also
very resistant

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:08.270
to insects and diseases

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:12.000
now you can grow determinate tomato
plants in 5-gallon

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.470
containers as you can see here or you can

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:18.920
go a little bit larger and grow them
in bigger containers

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:22.790
you cannot go wrong either ways because
tomatoes grow

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:27.070
great in containers of sizes 5 gallons
or above

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:30.540
So as you can see here in the month of April

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:34.840
this plant started producing these
lovely looking tomatoes

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.340
and by the time it was mid-april

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:41.360
I was able to harvest a few

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:44.560
small fruits from the tomato plant

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:49.050
now as the weather started getting a
little warmer

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:52.880
and we were in the month of May the

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:55.930
tomatoes that were produced  
started getting larger

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:59.820
and also started ripening on the plant

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:03.610
Now I like to keep my tomato plants clean

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:07.420
so if you notice the bottom parts of the
plant they're clean of

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:12.650
dead leaves or diseased leaves this is
very important for your tomato plant

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:16.989
so let's go ahead and harvest this tomato

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:20.330
and as you can see the

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:23.570
a significant amount of crackling

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:28.669
signs of cracks that you can see here on
this tomato

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:33.210
but overall the tomato was quite large
and quite nice

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:38.120
so once again this is the 
Containers Choice tomato

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:41.390
and compared to the

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:46.270
better bush variety this tomato
variety has a lot more

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:49.380
cracks being developed on the fruit

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:53.229
now again this doesn't really change
anything

00:04:53.229 --> 00:04:56.669
this tomato is also as delicious

00:04:56.669 --> 00:04:57.400
and

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:00.500
good-looking as the other tomato variety
we saw

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:06.170
so this tomato plant kept giving me
a lot of tomatoes

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:09.910
throughout the season and we're now in May

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:15.370
and I'm still harvesting tomatoes almost
every day from this tomato plant

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:18.880
so I wait for the fruits to ripen

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:22.570
on the plant on the vine and that
results in

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:27.490
the best quality tomatoes that you will
get so when we cut open this tomato

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:31.320
you can see it that this tomato variety
is a little bit more

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:36.080
juicy and between these two tomato
varieties

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:40.250
if I had to choose one I would
probably choose the better bush

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:44.620
however you cannot go wrong with either
of these tomato varieties

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:47.910
they're great tomato varieties for your
container garden

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:51.760
so I hope you like this video and I'd
like to know from you

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:55.670
what tomato varieties you grow in
containers and whether you like

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:56.990
growing determinate

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:00.270
or indeterminate tomatoes I'll see you
again soon

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:01.490
happy gardening I'm

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:04.420
