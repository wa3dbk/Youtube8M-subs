day I don't like what I see from this
game<00:00:20.130> so<00:00:20.310> far<00:00:20.490> but<00:00:20.970> I<00:00:21.270> admit<00:00:21.840> a<00:00:21.900> lot<00:00:22.140> of<00:00:22.320> that<00:00:22.500> is

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
game so far but I admit a lot of that is

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.740 
game so far but I admit a lot of that is
subjective<00:00:23.580> personal<00:00:23.970> preference<00:00:24.330> and<00:00:24.420> I

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
subjective personal preference and I

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.359 
subjective personal preference and I
understand<00:00:25.140> that<00:00:25.230> a<00:00:25.320> rational<00:00:25.800> person<00:00:25.830> could

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
understand that a rational person could

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.730 
understand that a rational person could
conceivably<00:00:27.180> disagree<00:00:27.930> with<00:00:28.080> me<00:00:28.230> on<00:00:28.260> that<00:00:28.529> and

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
conceivably disagree with me on that and

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.200 
conceivably disagree with me on that and
that's<00:00:28.980> fine<00:00:29.340> but<00:00:29.550> there's<00:00:29.730> one<00:00:29.789> thing<00:00:29.849> I<00:00:30.029> saw

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210
