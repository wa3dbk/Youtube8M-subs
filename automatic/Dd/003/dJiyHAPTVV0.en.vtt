00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
still time to order these from thinking

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.380 
still time to order these from thinking

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
this is one way to do it so here is the

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.860 
this is one way to do it so here is the
inside<00:02:25.950> the<00:02:26.069> box<00:02:26.280> you<00:02:26.459> can<00:02:26.640> see<00:02:26.880> the<00:02:27.120> brain

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
inside the box you can see the brain

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.470 
inside the box you can see the brain
cavity<00:02:28.319> is<00:02:28.620> open<00:02:29.070> just<00:02:29.790> kind<00:02:29.970> of<00:02:30.000> little<00:02:30.209> peek

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
cavity is open just kind of little peek

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.050 
cavity is open just kind of little peek
there<00:02:30.950> so<00:02:31.950> let's<00:02:32.130> go<00:02:32.250> ahead<00:02:32.280> and<00:02:32.490> roll<00:02:32.850> it<00:02:33.000> over

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
there so let's go ahead and roll it over

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:41.120 
there so let's go ahead and roll it over
here<00:02:33.420> and<00:02:34.670> bring<00:02:35.670> this<00:02:35.970> out<00:02:39.410> let's<00:02:40.410> see<00:02:40.800> how

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
here and bring this out let's see how

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:44.990 
here and bring this out let's see how
true<00:02:42.030> to<00:02:42.239> form<00:02:42.480> it<00:02:42.690> is<00:02:42.840> to<00:02:43.230> the<00:02:43.380> picture<00:02:44.000> that

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
true to form it is to the picture that

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:51.410 
true to form it is to the picture that
is<00:02:45.390> only<00:02:45.720> Fox<00:02:46.260> here<00:02:47.780> there<00:02:48.780> we<00:02:48.900> go<00:02:49.110> a<00:02:49.350> geek<00:02:50.420> then

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
is only Fox here there we go a geek then

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:57.050 
is only Fox here there we go a geek then
the<00:02:51.780> big<00:02:52.019> reveal<00:02:52.230> I<00:02:53.330> can<00:02:54.330> do<00:02:54.450> this<00:02:54.630> with<00:02:55.519> one<00:02:56.519> in

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
the big reveal I can do this with one in

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:02.000 
the big reveal I can do this with one in
here<00:02:58.070> so<00:02:59.090> it<00:03:00.090> is<00:03:00.420> a<00:03:00.660> rather<00:03:00.870> large<00:03:01.230> purple

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
here so it is a rather large purple

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.310 
here so it is a rather large purple
probably<00:03:02.850> one<00:03:03.060> that<00:03:03.090> could<00:03:03.480> be<00:03:03.690> a<00:03:03.720> lot<00:03:04.110> easier

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:04.320 
probably one that could be a lot easier

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:08.600 
probably one that could be a lot easier

got the little half grin there in the

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.740 
got the little half grin there in the
pig-like<00:03:25.890> snout<00:03:25.950> and<00:03:27.079> there's<00:03:28.079> one<00:03:28.350> here<00:03:28.739> and

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:29.750 
pig-like snout and there's one here and

pig-like snout and there's one here and
there's<00:03:30.750> the<00:03:31.019> other<00:03:31.190> and<00:03:32.190> let's<00:03:32.370> look<00:03:32.549> at<00:03:32.700> the

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:32.820 
there's the other and let's look at the

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:38.030 
there's the other and let's look at the
back<00:03:34.549> so<00:03:35.549> there's<00:03:35.700> a<00:03:36.079> looks<00:03:37.079> like<00:03:37.230> a<00:03:37.260> gaping

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
back so there's a looks like a gaping

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.400 
back so there's a looks like a gaping
wound<00:03:38.220> on<00:03:38.820> the<00:03:38.850> back<00:03:38.970> of<00:03:39.269> the<00:03:39.329> head<00:03:39.570> and<00:03:39.900> then

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
wound on the back of the head and then

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:41.660 
wound on the back of the head and then
of<00:03:40.530> course<00:03:40.560> whatever<00:03:41.040> you<00:03:41.220> feel<00:03:41.400> on<00:03:41.579> the

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 
of course whatever you feel on the

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:45.830 
of course whatever you feel on the
inside<00:03:43.670> would<00:03:44.670> be<00:03:44.700> the<00:03:44.940> brain<00:03:45.150> material<00:03:45.660> so

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
inside would be the brain material so

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.539 
inside would be the brain material so
you<00:03:46.230> know<00:03:46.320> I<00:03:46.380> think<00:03:46.470> so<00:03:46.860> ideas<00:03:47.190> here<00:03:47.400> you

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:47.549 
you know I think so ideas here you

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:50.780 
you know I think so ideas here you
probably<00:03:47.850> do<00:03:48.209> um<00:03:48.950> you<00:03:49.950> know<00:03:50.070> some<00:03:50.370> sort<00:03:50.610> of

00:03:59.900 --> 00:03:59.910 
stuff like that that'd be good we're

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:01.370 
stuff like that that'd be good we're
obviously<00:04:00.060> going<00:04:00.360> to<00:04:00.450> do<00:04:00.570> the<00:04:00.690> cereal<00:04:01.049> in<00:04:01.200> here

obviously going to do the cereal in here
tomorrow<00:04:01.650> just<00:04:02.160> because<00:04:02.459> it<00:04:02.610> has<00:04:02.730> a<00:04:02.760> flat

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
tomorrow just because it has a flat

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:04.460 
tomorrow just because it has a flat
bottom<00:04:03.090> it's<00:04:03.660> going<00:04:03.780> to<00:04:03.840> make<00:04:03.900> it<00:04:04.079> probably<00:04:04.440> a

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:04.470 
bottom it's going to make it probably a

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:06.140 
bottom it's going to make it probably a
little<00:04:04.680> little<00:04:05.280> bit<00:04:05.370> difficult<00:04:05.579> to<00:04:05.850> do<00:04:06.030> the

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
little little bit difficult to do the

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:09.130 
little little bit difficult to do the
cereal<00:04:06.560> but<00:04:07.560> it'll<00:04:07.739> be<00:04:07.829> fun<00:04:08.010> for<00:04:08.130> the<00:04:08.220> kids<00:04:08.250> and

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:09.140 
cereal but it'll be fun for the kids and

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:11.330 
cereal but it'll be fun for the kids and
so<00:04:10.140> we're<00:04:10.290> looking<00:04:10.590> forward<00:04:10.859> to<00:04:11.100> that<00:04:11.130> and

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 
so we're looking forward to that and

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:12.590 
so we're looking forward to that and
then<00:04:11.459> probably<00:04:11.609> we<00:04:11.760> get<00:04:11.940> done<00:04:12.090> we'll<00:04:12.299> use<00:04:12.450> this

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:12.600 
then probably we get done we'll use this

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.810 
then probably we get done we'll use this
for<00:04:12.870> like<00:04:13.019> popcorn<00:04:13.320> and<00:04:14.010> stuff<00:04:14.280> and<00:04:14.519> we<00:04:14.640> have

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:25.129 
can see this is my hand you guys know
that<00:04:23.070> I'm<00:04:23.220> pretty<00:04:23.430> tall<00:04:23.700> guy<00:04:23.970> I

00:04:25.129 --> 00:04:25.139 
that I'm pretty tall guy I

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:29.089 
that I'm pretty tall guy I
and<00:04:25.499> so<00:04:25.740> this<00:04:25.889> is<00:04:25.949> a<00:04:26.129> pretty<00:04:27.469> big<00:04:28.469> sized<00:04:28.710> bowl

00:04:29.089 --> 00:04:29.099

00:04:29.099 --> 00:04:32.839 
and so this is a pretty big sized bowl
here<00:04:29.460> i'd<00:04:30.270> say<00:04:30.509> probably<00:04:31.370> across<00:04:32.370> stops<00:04:32.639> about

00:04:32.839 --> 00:04:32.849 
here i'd say probably across stops about

00:04:32.849 --> 00:04:36.050 
here i'd say probably across stops about
six<00:04:33.120> inches<00:04:33.300> across<00:04:33.629> i<00:04:33.990> guess<00:04:34.289> about<00:04:34.710> right<00:04:35.060> so

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.060 
six inches across i guess about right so

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:38.149 
six inches across i guess about right so

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:48.960 
the cereal to the bowl so this is

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:52.129 
the cereal to the bowl so this is
Reagan's<00:04:49.439> and<00:04:49.740> Jackson's<00:04:50.639> is<00:04:51.509> in<00:04:51.719> the<00:04:51.810> pantry

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:53.550 
right now it's still needing to be

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:56.510 
right now it's still needing to be
unboxed<00:04:54.449> so<00:04:54.689> we<00:04:55.409> will<00:04:55.560> get<00:04:55.710> that<00:04:55.889> done<00:04:56.159> in<00:04:56.430> the
