00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:04.740
 hey people with children as well 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.960
 youth teams take a ball out of the 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:10.830
 we have the topline for you 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:12.630
 tafelberg brings the devil junior gives 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.160
 it with two different ones 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.880
 weight classes once we are here 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:20.580
 have 390 grams size 5 and once 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:23.730
 with only 290 grams weight and then in 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.720
 the sizes 4 and special 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.519
 characteristics of the ball 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.189
 Of course the weight that ever 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:32.070
 after that for a different you 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.719
 thought is a link to the individual 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.020
 crews I copy the again 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.879
 description 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:40.829
 otherwise the ball is a ball 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:44.399
 very strong on the top training ball has 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:46.260
 that is, it comes a sewn or a 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.960
 welded construction for use the 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:53.309
 individual seams are with tspg 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:55.770
 glued in addition, the original form 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:59.460
 used the panels from the peat factory 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:01.020
 or also from the bazaar special feature of the 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.850
 Of course it is the ball 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.010
 glued type the glued seam 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.720
 Above all , preventing possible that 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.610
 moisture can penetrate the ball 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.180
 and so you have a special one 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.650
 durable children and youth football 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.689
 I would also like to point out that 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.470
 the ball is intended for all teams 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:21.299
 is where later a 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:24.330
 play ball should also be used 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:26.430
 the goal line with the toggenburg junior 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:29.520
 can jupiter and adolescents 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:33.390
 already early to an original 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:37.439
 play at the accustomed peat factory junior 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:39.509
 whether 350 or 290 is a ball of the 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:41.700
 as training under playable thought 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:44.399
 the surface as you see it here 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.140
 can be very durable so 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.930
 the ball for all natural 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:51.000
 Underground is thought and so by the 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.380
 construction also holds very good games 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.689
 properties and flow properties 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.149
 offers and over a long period of time 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:59.040
 can be used 

00:01:56.149 --> 00:02:01.049
 My question to you, of course, how 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.969
 you like it and especially if 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.350
 the youth trainers have trained here 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:06.270
 he has a youth team with one 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.720
 glued tape or prefers, however 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.630
 still 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.680
 a traditional incidentally that would 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:13.110
 I'm really interested 

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:15.180
 otherwise I would constantly be in the 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:19.040
 description should you have questions 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.040
 like for facebook youtube or twitter
