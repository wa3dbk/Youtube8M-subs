00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:11.580
 and there folks okay mark dowd not here 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.570
 with you for another video about 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.700
 guitar 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.200
 I'm going to show you a video today about 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.689
 a subject that is very interesting in 

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:20.580
 some students ask me is it easy already 

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:23.939
 have asked this question sometimes 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:26.520
 I found it interesting to show here what 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.739
 they asked in the case is the following 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:31.169
 he asked Marco that you take yours 

00:00:28.739 --> 00:00:33.180
 guitar case when you 're gone 

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:35.190
 going out will touch will do something 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.200
 It will show that you are out of 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.809
 home what you take you think it is 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.309
 essential and you really do not think 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.800
 You can get carried away 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:47.879
 So I'm going to show you today in the case 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:50.219
 number 2 15m avoided case is equal to 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.350
 both the novel to look at the other 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.999
 so I hope you like it and that it is 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.640
 useful for all of you let's 

00:00:53.999 --> 00:00:58.859
 Look, then let's have a look. 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.690
 look this one I did in my jackson 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.539
 It's my logic, right? 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:07.890
 the famous green jackson you see 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:13.619
 the videos then're the opening are here 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:15.659
 she's cute then kept O're the 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.490
 I usually use the following 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:21.030
 People, you may think it 's fresh. 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:23.579
 but I have three different flannels 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:27.299
 to be able to clean it 

00:01:23.579 --> 00:01:30.869
 This one here is always here. 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:33.270
 strings okay I just step it on the ropes only 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.579
 flannel passes more strings than it is when 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.500
 You just have to step inside you. 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.899
 touch something you give a pass 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.869
 take the rope here and throw it 

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:44.969
 that excess you leave of some 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.520
 uor something some residue give a 

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:51.359
 last light is a one to 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:54.329
 give that power taken this one is okay 

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:56.250
 this slum here's with h in it or O 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:59.759
 is the hardware 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:02.219
 in it I'm clean the hardware is what I pass 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:06.899
 usually by taking the UN team in place 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:09.210
 where you have your hand supporting the right 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:11.490
 picking fashion where you support that is 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:13.490
 more or less in this part here 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:15.920
 bridge over 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:17.930
 the thing of collectors right clean 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.000
 also the balls of the sensors because 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:22.070
 the next one where you will accumulate more in your 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.890
 hand will're here to play you will catch 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:26.870
 on top 20 so this is one thing that only 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:29.300
 runs a very strong risk of oxidation 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:31.790
 depending on the sweat you have on your hand 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:33.740
 so what I do is this 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:35.570
 Flannel is just for that 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:38.480
 just so you have an idea is this 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:42.590
 guitar I bought her come she came to 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:44.540
 me in 2009 until today will do now go 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.910
 2015 us and six years that I 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:50.510
 played guitar she does not have a point of 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:51.980
 rust has nothing nothing nothing not 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:55.160
 rust nowhere 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:56.870
 This is the flannel I clean. 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:59.510
 The same guitar is usually when I 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:01.730
 I'm going to put something on a polisher then 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:05.480
 until sweat sweeps away something that 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:08.210
 arm coast is also only this is only 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:10.460
 to the body's arm and back 

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:12.410
 because behind the arm and is also this 

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:17.090
 part of that same material here this 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:19.670
 my, my painting is so it's just going 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:21.440
 here is something else that 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:23.450
 I can not help but be 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:28.130
 with me always a bundle of rope what 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:30.530
 I use ebó 09, I can not let you leave 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:33.910
 to take this because if it happens 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:37.070
 something I have or how it is rest 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:41.030
 It's something else that I use after I 

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:44.570
 I clean the part of the strings, I'll go there. 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:46.340
 It always made you fresh here. 

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:50.960
 you arrive in a past then things 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:51.530
 here it helps to keep the strings of the 

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:53.810
 soul 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:56.510
 if it was a cleaner or something 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:59.000
 so then is the front of the jega this 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:00.590
 do not stop using something that I take 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.710
 always also that we have to take 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:06.350
 to run 'double' right 

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:08.870
 Here it is straight're you'll leave 

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:10.520
 always in your case if you 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:13.850
 have to change the rope I always have 

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:18.230
 that's not the one you use 

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:23.210
 rolling the rope is day to take I have a 

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:26.120
 old tuner né d'accord logic 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:27.860
 I think it's great, I love this guy. 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:32.570
 can be old battery runs 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:34.880
 It works there electricity here 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:37.190
 You can put the font on the face but I 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:39.410
 I love it so if you go to the final 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:42.470
 Your club here right away, huh? 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:45.080
 you have there guitar program you have 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:46.400
 Ball that fell is perfect I love it 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:48.440
 can not fail to have 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:51.650
 It's another thing I always take 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:53.389
 is also the following here cow bitch 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:56.810
 You also have to have the one you use. 

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:58.760
 You 're here, you always have this. 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:00.289
 this little broomstick here that I use for 

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:02.020
 you take off right? 

00:05:00.289 --> 00:05:03.680
 the dust residues they accumulate 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:05.690
 mainly in these parts 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:08.300
 little ones of the cart né 

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:10.610
 Where you can not take it right? 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:13.070
 cedars in the carts you take away from this 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:15.380
 part accumulates a lot of dirt here where 

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:18.050
 you are is put glue here along with 

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:18.680
 notepad right then you get a lot 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:21.169
 hence 

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:23.150
 This is what I always use, what I do not 

00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:25.880
 may also be missing 

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:28.280
 it's the reeds, I do not use it here, I'll take it 

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:32.860
 my little plants that fit here 

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:35.210
 use a pencil tube 2.0 of the use here 

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:36.919
 in that box a box of that 

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:38.840
 surprise coming inside the egg kinder 

00:05:36.919 --> 00:05:40.490
 do not you wanna eat the other one 

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:44.210
 So I'd rather be left with that. 

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:46.220
 created then I take this here it leads to 

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:52.340
 Laptop is small and you can take it. 

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:53.690
 this is the key to jackson city 

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:56.389
 what do you see right? 

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:58.400
 generally you need to close and what 

00:05:56.389 --> 00:06:02.240
 I always have a face here too. 

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:04.039
 silica gel sachet I always 

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:05.990
 I leave something here to walk 

00:06:04.039 --> 00:06:09.380
 mold smell take away any moisture 

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:11.240
 thing that you have beauty then the 

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:13.370
 another case is the same but let's go 

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:15.110
 take a look 

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:16.760
 guys let's see how it ends there will 

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:18.289
 to have a lot of difference is like I said 

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:21.110
 I like to keep a pattern on the things I 

00:06:18.289 --> 00:06:24.080
 I 'll do it then, let's take a look here 

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:28.669
 on the other reversal, this is another case here 

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:31.190
 it's the case of the law rounet my other 

00:06:28.669 --> 00:06:32.419
 guitar the road and what I have here 

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:34.219
 huh 

00:06:32.419 --> 00:06:38.300
 like I said I have another game of 

00:06:34.219 --> 00:06:39.980
 ropes here 

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:42.680
 also the vane box 

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:45.230
 I leave my kitchen here to be able to 

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:47.300
 clean the carts here 

00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:49.010
 the three pots this issue up further 

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:50.450
 because it does not use much 

00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:52.670
 guitar right 

00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:53.750
 so I leave here she left 

00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:56.810
 ready 

00:06:53.750 --> 00:07:00.220
 here is mine, run 

00:06:56.810 --> 00:07:02.660
 image philippe locke lever her 

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:05.960
 here little 

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:09.020
 in the jackson manual here some boxes 

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:13.310
 of silica, this is always going to be here 

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:14.840
 the guitar key when using this 

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:17.390
 for something I will come and I will 

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:19.220
 I'll get the other one to be able to 

00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:22.730
 change here the part of the tuner 

00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:24.890
 that I can use only that he is also 

00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:26.000

00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:27.500
