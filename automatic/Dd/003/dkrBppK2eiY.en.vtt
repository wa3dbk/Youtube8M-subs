and<00:01:56.409> stuff<00:01:56.560> like<00:01:56.740> that<00:01:56.950> or<00:01:57.220> do<00:01:57.670> different

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
and stuff like that or do different

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.279 
and stuff like that or do different
different<00:02:00.909> types<00:02:01.090> of<00:02:01.330> you<00:02:01.509> know<00:02:01.630> use

00:02:02.279 --> 00:02:02.289 
different types of you know use

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:03.600 
different types of you know use
different<00:02:02.619> type<00:02:02.800> of<00:02:02.830> entry<00:02:03.100> points<00:02:03.159> like

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:03.610 
different type of entry points like

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:08.729 
different type of entry points like
holding<00:02:03.970> to<00:02:04.149> through<00:02:04.869> air<00:02:05.080> shaft<00:02:06.270> and<00:02:07.739> it

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:08.739 
holding to through air shaft and it

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:10.800 
holding to through air shaft and it
basically<00:02:08.860> makes<00:02:09.340> the<00:02:09.519> game<00:02:09.810> highly

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
basically makes the game highly

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:11.550 
basically makes the game highly
replayable

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
replayable

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.350 
replayable
because<00:02:11.920> you<00:02:12.040> can't<00:02:12.519> just<00:02:12.640> learn<00:02:12.880> the<00:02:13.090> level

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
because you can't just learn the level

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:14.759 
because you can't just learn the level
by<00:02:13.510> oh<00:02:13.540> there's<00:02:13.930> a<00:02:13.959> guy<00:02:14.140> over<00:02:14.170> there<00:02:14.410> and<00:02:14.680> guy

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:14.769 
by oh there's a guy over there and guy

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:16.620 
by oh there's a guy over there and guy
over<00:02:14.920> there<00:02:15.100> you<00:02:15.459> actually<00:02:15.580> have<00:02:15.819> to<00:02:16.000> really

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630 
over there you actually have to really

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:18.570 
over there you actually have to really
be<00:02:16.750> on<00:02:16.780> your<00:02:16.900> toes<00:02:17.170> real<00:02:17.440> time<00:02:17.709> and<00:02:18.250> even<00:02:18.430> if

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
be on your toes real time and even if

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:20.460 
be on your toes real time and even if
you<00:02:18.730> and<00:02:18.910> your<00:02:18.970> friends<00:02:19.300> have<00:02:19.450> a<00:02:19.480> strategy<00:02:19.959> you

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
you and your friends have a strategy you

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:22.229 
you and your friends have a strategy you
need<00:02:20.680> to<00:02:20.830> adapt<00:02:21.100> it<00:02:21.250> all<00:02:21.370> the<00:02:21.459> time<00:02:21.610> you<00:02:22.120> know

00:02:22.229 --> 00:02:22.239 
need to adapt it all the time you know

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:24.630 
need to adapt it all the time you know
they're<00:02:23.110> gonna<00:02:23.230> change<00:02:23.530> it<00:02:23.680> up<00:02:23.830> and<00:02:24.250> then<00:02:24.489> you

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
they're gonna change it up and then you

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.460 
they're gonna change it up and then you
need<00:02:24.790> to<00:02:24.880> be<00:02:25.000> able<00:02:25.120> to<00:02:25.299> change<00:02:25.450> it<00:02:25.630> up<00:02:25.720> to<00:02:25.750> just

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
need to be able to change it up to just

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:28.170 
need to be able to change it up to just
like<00:02:26.620> replaying<00:02:26.950> the<00:02:27.220> map<00:02:27.400> is<00:02:27.610> not<00:02:27.640> just<00:02:28.030> like

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
like replaying the map is not just like

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:29.940 
like replaying the map is not just like
oh<00:02:28.450> let's<00:02:28.660> plate<00:02:28.810> up<00:02:28.840> map<00:02:29.140> is<00:02:29.290> the<00:02:29.440> same<00:02:29.680> sort

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
oh let's plate up map is the same sort

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.449 
oh let's plate up map is the same sort
of<00:02:30.069> map<00:02:30.190> it's<00:02:30.430> actually<00:02:30.760> going<00:02:30.850> to<00:02:30.970> be<00:02:31.060> it<00:02:31.989> is<00:02:32.049> a

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
of map it's actually going to be it is a

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:35.400 
of map it's actually going to be it is a
different<00:02:33.459> experience<00:02:33.989> not<00:02:34.989> too<00:02:35.200> different

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
different experience not too different

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:37.610 
different experience not too different
though<00:02:35.709> because<00:02:36.010> we<00:02:36.220> know<00:02:36.670> this<00:02:36.850> while

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
though because we know this while

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.289 
though because we know this while
testing<00:02:38.620> it<00:02:38.739> that<00:02:39.220> if<00:02:39.430> it's<00:02:39.640> two<00:02:39.910> different

00:02:40.289 --> 00:02:40.299 
testing it that if it's two different

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:41.970 
testing it that if it's two different
people<00:02:40.780> just<00:02:40.930> start<00:02:41.320> like<00:02:41.620> failing

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
people just start like failing

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:43.319 
people just start like failing
everywhere<00:02:42.370> and<00:02:42.670> they<00:02:42.790> can't<00:02:43.000> play<00:02:43.150> online

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:43.329 
everywhere and they can't play online

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:45.030 
everywhere and they can't play online
together<00:02:43.840> because<00:02:44.140> it's<00:02:44.320> like<00:02:44.440> oh<00:02:44.590> I<00:02:44.620> used<00:02:44.950> to

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
together because it's like oh I used to

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:46.830 
together because it's like oh I used to
do<00:02:45.160> this<00:02:45.340> but<00:02:45.609> now<00:02:45.760> it's<00:02:45.940> that<00:02:46.120> and<00:02:46.450> you<00:02:46.720> know

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
do this but now it's that and you know

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.199 
do this but now it's that and you know
like<00:02:47.200> that<00:02:47.350> so<00:02:47.859> it's<00:02:48.010> basically<00:02:48.340> everything

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:49.209 
like that so it's basically everything

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:52.410 
like that so it's basically everything
around<00:02:49.540> the<00:02:50.290> Intendant<00:02:50.980> plan<00:02:51.250> is<00:02:51.549> completely

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
around the Intendant plan is completely

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.599 
around the Intendant plan is completely
dynamic<00:02:52.989> you<00:02:53.440> can<00:02:53.470> play<00:02:53.739> I<00:02:53.950> mean<00:02:54.160> they<00:02:54.459> online

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:54.609 
dynamic you can play I mean they online

00:02:54.609 --> 00:02:56.580 
dynamic you can play I mean they online
with<00:02:55.090> your<00:02:55.239> friends<00:02:55.480> you<00:02:56.049> can<00:02:56.200> also<00:02:56.290> play<00:02:56.530> you

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
with your friends you can also play you

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:58.740 
with your friends you can also play you
know<00:02:56.769> Sigma<00:02:57.010> player<00:02:57.190> with<00:02:57.459> the<00:02:58.000> teammates<00:02:58.480> and

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
know Sigma player with the teammates and

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.050 
know Sigma player with the teammates and
they<00:02:59.440> will<00:02:59.590> have<00:02:59.769> you<00:03:00.190> know<00:03:00.220> dialogue<00:03:00.760> and

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
they will have you know dialogue and

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:02.670 
they will have you know dialogue and
certain<00:03:01.540> they<00:03:01.690> say<00:03:02.019> certain<00:03:02.380> things<00:03:02.410> that

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
certain they say certain things that

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:07.289 
certain they say certain things that
they<00:03:02.859> might<00:03:03.190> not<00:03:03.250> do<00:03:03.579> when<00:03:03.940> you<00:03:04.030> play<00:03:04.560> so<00:03:06.299> it's

00:03:07.289 --> 00:03:07.299 
they might not do when you play so it's

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:09.660 
they might not do when you play so it's
not<00:03:07.510> it's<00:03:08.079> not<00:03:08.260> just<00:03:08.320> like<00:03:08.829> the<00:03:08.859> boat<00:03:09.220> type

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
not it's not just like the boat type

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:12.599 
not it's not just like the boat type
feeling<00:03:09.970> when<00:03:10.750> you<00:03:10.810> play<00:03:10.989> Singapore<00:03:11.489> but<00:03:12.489> you

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:12.609 
feeling when you play Singapore but you

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:14.280 
feeling when you play Singapore but you
know<00:03:12.730> it's<00:03:13.000> a<00:03:13.090> cooperative<00:03:13.209> game<00:03:13.690> we<00:03:13.900> didn't

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290 
know it's a cooperative game we didn't

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:16.470 
know it's a cooperative game we didn't
focus<00:03:14.410> on<00:03:14.680> cooperative<00:03:15.010> so<00:03:15.370> I<00:03:15.910> think<00:03:16.269> it

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480 
focus on cooperative so I think it

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.840 
focus on cooperative so I think it
shines<00:03:16.750> the<00:03:16.989> best<00:03:17.200> incorporative<00:03:17.950> definitely

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:18.850 
shines the best incorporative definitely

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:20.729 
shines the best incorporative definitely
and<00:03:19.180> we<00:03:19.299> try<00:03:19.480> to<00:03:19.510> within<00:03:20.049> the<00:03:20.170> game<00:03:20.350> sort<00:03:20.620> of

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:20.739 
and we try to within the game sort of

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:22.800 
and we try to within the game sort of
get<00:03:20.980> people<00:03:21.340> to<00:03:21.459> go<00:03:21.579> online<00:03:21.730> and<00:03:21.940> you<00:03:22.690> know

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
get people to go online and you know

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:24.750 
get people to go online and you know
yeah<00:03:23.140> get<00:03:23.530> out<00:03:23.680> there<00:03:23.920> so<00:03:24.280> we<00:03:24.459> think<00:03:24.609> that's

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:24.760 
yeah get out there so we think that's

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.640 
yeah get out there so we think that's
the<00:03:24.910> most<00:03:25.090> fun<00:03:25.239> what<00:03:25.810> kind<00:03:25.989> of<00:03:26.049> planning<00:03:26.410> to<00:03:26.440> do

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
the most fun what kind of planning to do

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:27.870 
the most fun what kind of planning to do
is<00:03:26.769> there<00:03:26.890> something<00:03:27.220> that<00:03:27.340> you<00:03:27.430> do<00:03:27.519> before

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:27.880 
is there something that you do before

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:29.309 
is there something that you do before
the<00:03:28.030> mission<00:03:28.299> or<00:03:28.390> is<00:03:28.480> that<00:03:28.569> all<00:03:28.750> on<00:03:28.989> the<00:03:29.140> fly

00:03:29.309 --> 00:03:29.319 
the mission or is that all on the fly

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:31.470 
the mission or is that all on the fly
once<00:03:29.590> you<00:03:29.709> get<00:03:29.890> on<00:03:30.010> there<00:03:30.220> you<00:03:31.060> have<00:03:31.150> to<00:03:31.269> be<00:03:31.359> on

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480 
once you get on there you have to be on

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.539 
once you get on there you have to be on
the<00:03:31.569> fly<00:03:31.720> right<00:03:32.049> so<00:03:32.440> the<00:03:32.799> plan<00:03:32.980> is<00:03:33.010> sort<00:03:33.519> of

00:03:33.539 --> 00:03:33.549 
the fly right so the plan is sort of

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:34.890 
the fly right so the plan is sort of
predetermined
