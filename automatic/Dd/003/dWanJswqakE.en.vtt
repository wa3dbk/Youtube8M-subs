00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.340

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.950
 you quickly away again 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.720
 see i said you need the middle building 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:21.370
 to dominate and it always succeeds 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.050
 this man himself that is a concern she 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.180
 same free-for-all just as you have one 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:27.820
 game one plays against the remains should you 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.740
 always just dominate span building 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:31.270
 and in this man was the middle building 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:32.080
 really just the ideal spot because they 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:33.400
 exciting aah 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.140
 or four different sides and 4 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.120
 different sides that guest is the same 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:38.530
 four and crime coming at you and 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.270
 so that you are equal to a whole 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:41.530
 can play a game quickly if you can hit 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:43.209
 and I can't shoot with the 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:43.990
 scratchcards cosmopolitan always 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:45.160
 with it 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:46.720
 So now we have to go a long distance again 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.980
 Shoot the crossflow can also 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.990
 the short distance shoots but I love it 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.209
 from just a little remote the 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:53.650
 bunch of iphone thank you for being there 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:54.910
 suddenly i saw sharing fan that 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:56.380
 stand until it fired 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:57.610
 so now it is one or that stupid bliss 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:58.510
 too cold and and just have the jar 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:00.310
 can win very quickly 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:02.080
 that is because of that sparkle roll that 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:03.760
 I did it at the middle 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:05.050
 building and you were with the cat 40 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.519
 I really didn't expect that 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:07.989
 visconti with the fourth string cup and okay 

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:10.540
 only now when boring because it's the game 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:12.550
 head busy miss miss cut cola cup 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.720
 ballistec i had those things so hard he 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:15.220
 can never make it once minus nobody 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.450

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.680
 all very nice thank you 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:19.989
 there was still a chance to win in it 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.790
 three minutes if a clock now stands 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:23.170
 the drink for watching guys that cross 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:24.370
 boat and I think those decisions 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:25.150
 it always shines in at once 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:26.410
 to make 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:28.030
 actually you just have to be able to game 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:30.370
 completely swap that you can game map 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:31.480
 reverse can game have some tick one 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:32.880
 cool thing that your first goal is too 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.900
 get there a the crasborn to the 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.100
 sniper or something I now know what's going on 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.570
 coming but thanks for watching guys 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:39.220
