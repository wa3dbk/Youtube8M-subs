old-school chex mix with a few new ideas
I<00:00:52.890> grew<00:00:53.730> up<00:00:53.760> doing<00:00:54.000> stuff<00:00:54.329> like<00:00:54.360> this<00:00:54.540> it's

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:54.990 
I grew up doing stuff like this it's

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:57.680 
I grew up doing stuff like this it's
basically<00:00:55.410> my<00:00:55.620> roots<00:00:55.860> I<00:00:56.239> also<00:00:57.239> like<00:00:57.510> it

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
basically my roots I also like it

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.180 
basically my roots I also like it
because<00:00:57.720> I<00:00:57.960> get<00:00:58.140> stuff<00:00:58.500> a<00:00:58.620> lot<00:00:58.739> of<00:00:58.860> times<00:00:59.070> I've

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
because I get stuff a lot of times I've

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.450 
because I get stuff a lot of times I've
never<00:00:59.370> do<00:00:59.610> with<00:00:59.760> background<00:01:01.220> this<00:01:02.220> is<00:01:02.310> watch

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
never do with background this is watch

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.069 
never do with background this is watch
this<00:01:02.670> and<00:01:02.880> I'll<00:01:03.060> play<00:01:03.210> point<00:01:03.510> from<00:01:03.750> one<00:01:03.960> of

00:01:04.069 --> 00:01:04.079 
this and I'll play point from one of

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:06.289 
this and I'll play point from one of
sciences<00:01:04.500> I<00:01:04.619> like<00:01:04.799> most<00:01:05.040> it<00:01:05.640> has<00:01:05.790> a<00:01:05.820> lot<00:01:06.030> to<00:01:06.149> do

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
sciences I like most it has a lot to do

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:11.910 
sciences I like most it has a lot to do
with<00:01:06.329> some<00:01:06.600> of<00:01:06.720> the<00:01:06.780> things<00:01:06.930> I<00:01:07.110> read<00:01:07.320> about

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:11.920 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.510 

if<00:01:12.549> there<00:01:13.270> is<00:01:13.299> only<00:01:13.750> one<00:01:14.200> possible<00:01:14.560> unified

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:15.520 
if there is only one possible unified

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.510 
if there is only one possible unified
theory<00:01:16.000> that<00:01:16.869> is<00:01:17.080> just<00:01:17.439> a<00:01:17.619> set<00:01:17.860> of<00:01:18.040> rules<00:01:18.250> and

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:18.520 
theory that is just a set of rules and

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:22.980 
theory that is just a set of rules and
equations<00:01:20.670> what<00:01:21.670> I<00:01:21.700> said<00:01:22.030> that<00:01:22.210> breeds<00:01:22.600> iron

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:22.990 
equations what I said that breeds iron

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:26.190 
equations what I said that breeds iron
to<00:01:23.409> the<00:01:23.619> equations<00:01:24.280> and<00:01:25.090> makes<00:01:25.420> a<00:01:25.689> universe

go to all the bother of existing this
aluna<00:01:37.630> fight<00:01:37.869> theory<00:01:38.229> is<00:01:38.380> so<00:01:38.590> compelling<00:01:39.130> that

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:39.670 
aluna fight theory is so compelling that

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:44.309 
aluna fight theory is so compelling that
it<00:01:40.180> brings<00:01:40.479> about<00:01:40.810> its<00:01:41.229> own<00:01:41.439> existence<00:01:43.319> or

00:01:44.309 --> 00:01:44.319 
it brings about its own existence or

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:49.710 
it brings about its own existence or
does<00:01:44.679> it<00:01:44.710> need<00:01:45.100> a<00:01:45.159> creator<00:01:45.640> and<00:01:47.460> if<00:01:48.460> so<00:01:49.000> who

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:49.720 
does it need a creator and if so who

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:54.930 
does it need a creator and if so who
created<00:01:50.710> him<00:01:53.220> when<00:01:54.220> I<00:01:54.280> look<00:01:54.429> back<00:01:54.460> at<00:01:54.789> my<00:01:54.819> old

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:54.940 
created him when I look back at my old

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:56.910 
created him when I look back at my old
videos<00:01:55.299> I<00:01:55.630> still<00:01:55.869> kind<00:01:56.080> of<00:01:56.140> see<00:01:56.350> the<00:01:56.470> tablet

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:56.920 
videos I still kind of see the tablet

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.320 
videos I still kind of see the tablet
it's<00:01:57.100> being<00:01:57.459> some<00:01:57.700> of<00:01:57.759> the<00:01:57.819> hardest<00:01:58.090> things

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:58.330 
it's being some of the hardest things

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:01.410 
it's being some of the hardest things
I've<00:01:58.450> ever<00:01:58.569> done<00:01:59.549> most<00:02:00.549> of<00:02:00.670> my<00:02:00.789> footage<00:02:01.030> i<00:02:01.240> look

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 
I've ever done most of my footage i look

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:02.880 
I've ever done most of my footage i look
at<00:02:01.539> it<00:02:01.569> being<00:02:01.840> transitioning<00:02:02.470> from<00:02:02.649> free

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:02.890 
at it being transitioning from free
