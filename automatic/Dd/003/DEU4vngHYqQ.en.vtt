00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:05.960
 especially for this case point ru 

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:08.639
 if you look it means for different 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:10.540
 either my first followers either 

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:12.380
 casual viewers who can 

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:13.430
 stop 

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:15.470
 Well, today I will speak about 

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:18.170
 new game americano magid al with on one 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:21.170
 of their victims 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:35.710
 eu 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:37.370
 Total 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:40.370
 but rest 

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:46.000
 m 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.210
 In general, the main thing that the game clings times 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.310
 this is actually the entourage instead 

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:53.200
 marvelous of this wonderland lewis carroll 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.750
 this wonderland here is direct blood and 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:58.069
 a bunch of severed limbs 

00:00:58.069 --> 00:01:00.439
 in fact, I have always been 

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:02.419
 I wonder why all the fairy tales should be 

00:01:02.419 --> 00:01:04.869
 so light it's just boring and 

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:06.520
 trite why like a fairy tale about 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:09.119
 carlson carlson and descended in with the roof 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:10.499
 would start better today 

00:01:10.499 --> 00:01:12.870
 pre-Moscow jam 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:15.030
 so it would be much more fun to fly yo 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.340
 So back to Alice on the plot of the game 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.710
 is a continuation of the first 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:20.680
 parts which I did not play will not lie 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.290
 so of course you compare with the original 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:24.400
 I can not 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:25.450
 but it doesn't matter 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:27.560
 and the trouble is that it is a pancake 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.820
 three-dimensional arcade platform with which 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.490
 I personally have always had problems 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:32.600
 but more about that later 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.060
 and now the beginning of the game 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:35.880
 most police are going through a session 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.520
 psychotherapy with a doctor who 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.960
 trying to study us like put 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.130
 they are associated with a terrible fire 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:44.190
 leagues take native coalition 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:46.090
 all this time we have seen very much 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:49.310
 atmospheric made by style 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.320
 forest or direct current from all firms 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.320
 in general, you yourself will see everything on your own 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:55.900
 why tell the screen 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:57.810
 after five minutes of listeria we fall 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.080
 in the game world which by the way looks 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.070
 very good I at least 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.310
 I expected a much worse picture 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.220
 moreover, you can even put 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:08.429
 first person viktor 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.689
 see for example this here 

00:02:10.689 --> 00:02:12.539
 very scary school club 

00:02:12.539 --> 00:02:15.509
 This she here, too, there is where already without it in 

00:02:15.509 --> 00:02:17.259
 some moment it seemed to me that there 

00:02:17.259 --> 00:02:18.539
 where is it possible to meet ivan 

00:02:18.539 --> 00:02:21.039
 KAMAZ surely you here after something like 

00:02:21.039 --> 00:02:22.280
 that we don't care 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:23.990
 Alas, but contemplate it very much 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:26.090
 atmospheric picture in this very 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:28.300
 gloomy city we have to just a little 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.999
 a little bit 

00:02:28.999 --> 00:02:30.679
 after which we are carried over the country 

00:02:30.679 --> 00:02:31.829
 wonders that look like 

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:33.489
 swarming honestly 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:34.999
 what we meet cheshire cat 

00:02:34.999 --> 00:02:37.180
 which broadcasts to us about that wonderland 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.829
 dark times gives us legs teaches us 

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:41.310
 become small to 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.150
 crawl into various stinking slits 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.739
 pain comes later when appear 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:48.859
 enemies first enemies are big black 

00:02:48.859 --> 00:02:51.279
 poop with faces the dome will not make you 

00:02:51.279 --> 00:02:51.930
 of problems 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.520
 and here these are flying dragonfly to him all this 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:57.290
 unreal motes of frost firstly i 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:59.120
 apparently accidentally threw a hint 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.190
 saying that baku stop them 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:03.140
 the restaurant does not need to destroy them 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:04.599
 it seems again 

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:05.609
 to pieces g 

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:07.299
 so in this game played a lot 

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:09.269
 the first earth stones will be made of it 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:11.749
 enemies texture in general everything 

00:03:11.749 --> 00:03:13.559
 and I don't know it just stood 

00:03:13.559 --> 00:03:15.629
 match vain trying not to die i 

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:16.989
 spent ten or fifteen on it 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:19.349
 minutes why not write for example 

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:21.629
 foe screens destroy the public and 

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:23.089
 don't hide it hint it's the same 

00:03:23.089 --> 00:03:25.259
 only the first damn level he 

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:27.499
 there must be training 

00:03:27.499 --> 00:03:29.319
 but further more intensified when 

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:31.639
 appear jumping and 3d platformer less 

00:03:31.639 --> 00:03:33.629
 ten even during the time of the first search solved 

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:35.619
 or let's say the money from the bate was well 

00:03:35.619 --> 00:03:38.280
 very much everything is the same here 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:39.950
 eternal peace to president racia 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:41.380
 camera which does not give an estimate 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:43.390
 distance understand political or not 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:45.569
 and it just pisses me off 

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:47.359
 very hard to believe 

00:03:47.359 --> 00:03:49.459
 and even more infuriating music 

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:52.459
 listen to 

00:04:07.689 --> 00:04:09.400
 to it's just drum forehead 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.109
 which looped it repeats 

00:04:11.109 --> 00:04:14.129
 constantly reducing myself again I was 

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:15.849
 close to grab a kitchen knife 

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:18.299
 cut off your ears and take them yourself 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:20.930
 so as not to hear all this 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:23.550
 very sad that the first location is drying 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:25.570
 lotto player and no need to do anything 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:27.960
 except how to go there and here looked 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:30.639
 felt hundreds of times better than proper 

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:33.039
 saying the main game scene is country 

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:34.439
 miracles 

00:04:34.439 --> 00:04:37.309
 perhaps worth mentioning speed up weapons 

00:04:37.309 --> 00:04:39.069
 but there is both neighbor and 

00:04:39.069 --> 00:04:41.629
 Brezhnev's long-range kitchen 

00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:42.070
 knife 

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:44.130
 Well, the far pepper is a pity that 

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:46.470
 there are no grenades made from but guys 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:48.050
 you are very subscribed it was all this 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:49.820
 bacchanalia not surprising that 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:52.360
 face went crazy being under any fast bodies 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:54.540
 so sorry but not giving up this game 

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:55.539
 Tamils ​​did not get up 

00:04:55.539 --> 00:04:57.379
 such media to these cases are not mud 

00:04:57.379 --> 00:04:59.009
 need general statistics and 

00:04:59.009 --> 00:05:00.939
 atmosphere and most importantly for the original idea 

00:05:00.939 --> 00:05:03.960
 and the first location is my personal rating 56 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:05.479
 half a point thanks with you 

00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:06.679
 speak good
