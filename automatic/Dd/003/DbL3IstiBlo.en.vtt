cut like kind of like layers and - it
kind<00:00:17.490> of<00:00:17.550> looks<00:00:17.609> very<00:00:18.179> similar<00:00:18.480> to<00:00:18.689> the<00:00:18.779> shape

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
kind of looks very similar to the shape

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.179 
kind of looks very similar to the shape
I<00:00:19.170> had<00:00:19.380> my<00:00:20.390> wig<00:00:21.390> if<00:00:21.810> you<00:00:22.019> look<00:00:22.230> in<00:00:22.349> my<00:00:22.500> videos<00:00:22.890> I

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
I had my wig if you look in my videos I

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.749 
I had my wig if you look in my videos I
have<00:00:23.400> a<00:00:23.810> kind<00:00:24.810> of<00:00:24.900> a<00:00:25.019> curly<00:00:25.759> natural-looking

00:00:26.749 --> 00:00:26.759 
have a kind of a curly natural-looking

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:31.489 
have a kind of a curly natural-looking
wig<00:00:27.240> that<00:00:27.779> I<00:00:28.140> made<00:00:28.890> with<00:00:29.189> combs<00:00:29.550> and<00:00:30.329> I<00:00:30.659> was

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:31.499 
wig that I made with combs and I was

00:00:31.499 --> 00:00:33.830 
wig that I made with combs and I was
able<00:00:31.740> to<00:00:31.769> take<00:00:31.980> it<00:00:32.009> off<00:00:32.220> every<00:00:32.550> night<00:00:32.730> or<00:00:33.629> every

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
able to take it off every night or every

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.279 
able to take it off every night or every
day<00:00:33.980> so<00:00:34.980> it<00:00:35.039> looks<00:00:35.280> very<00:00:35.640> similar<00:00:36.239> maybe<00:00:36.840> I

00:00:37.279 --> 00:00:37.289 
day so it looks very similar maybe I

00:00:37.289 --> 00:00:41.680 
day so it looks very similar maybe I
left<00:00:37.739> it<00:00:37.890> you<00:00:38.879> know<00:00:39.030> with<00:00:39.239> longer<00:00:39.750> layers<00:00:40.250> but

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:41.690 
left it you know with longer layers but

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:45.680 
left it you know with longer layers but
I<00:00:42.690> actually<00:00:42.870> really<00:00:43.230> like<00:00:43.469> it<00:00:43.820> I<00:00:44.820> still<00:00:45.480> think

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
I actually really like it I still think

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.939 
I actually really like it I still think
it's<00:00:45.809> it's<00:00:46.379> kind<00:00:47.280> of<00:00:47.370> big<00:00:47.579> but<00:00:47.969> um<00:00:48.800> the<00:00:49.800> main

00:00:49.939 --> 00:00:49.949 
it's it's kind of big but um the main

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:51.799 
it's it's kind of big but um the main
thing<00:00:50.160> I<00:00:50.250> was<00:00:50.370> going<00:00:50.670> for<00:00:50.910> was<00:00:51.239> more<00:00:51.600> of<00:00:51.719> a

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
thing I was going for was more of a

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.220 
thing I was going for was more of a
natural<00:00:52.019> look<00:00:52.530> not<00:00:53.070> just<00:00:53.399> curly<00:00:54.179> because<00:00:54.960> my

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
natural look not just curly because my

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.650 
natural look not just curly because my
hair<00:00:55.469> texture<00:00:55.859> isn't<00:00:56.070> curly<00:00:56.760> it's<00:00:57.120> you<00:00:57.510> know<00:00:57.629> a

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
hair texture isn't curly it's you know a

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.209 
hair texture isn't curly it's you know a
coarse<00:00:58.140> and<00:00:59.629> it<00:01:00.629> doesn't<00:01:00.960> have<00:01:01.170> a<00:01:01.620> defined

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
coarse and it doesn't have a defined

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.580 
coarse and it doesn't have a defined
curl<00:01:02.760> pattern<00:01:03.149> which<00:01:03.269> is<00:01:03.390> fine<00:01:03.660> so<00:01:04.379> I<00:01:04.440> was

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:04.590 
curl pattern which is fine so I was

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:06.800 
curl pattern which is fine so I was
something<00:01:04.830> that<00:01:04.980> kind<00:01:05.700> of<00:01:05.760> mimics<00:01:06.150> that<00:01:06.390> with

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
something that kind of mimics that with

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.630 
something that kind of mimics that with
like<00:01:06.960> a<00:01:06.990> braid<00:01:07.350> out<00:01:07.590> to<00:01:07.890> style<00:01:08.130> kind<00:01:08.370> of<00:01:08.460> look

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
like a braid out to style kind of look

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.490 
like a braid out to style kind of look
so<00:01:09.450> this<00:01:09.660> was<00:01:09.840> the<00:01:09.960> result

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
so this was the result

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.230 
so this was the result
um<00:01:11.720> I'll<00:01:12.720> try<00:01:13.320> to<00:01:13.470> do<00:01:13.800> it<00:01:13.890> 360<00:01:14.280> I'm<00:01:14.610> holding<00:01:15.090> it

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
um I'll try to do it 360 I'm holding it

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:28.370 
um I'll try to do it 360 I'm holding it
so<00:01:15.480> it's<00:01:15.600> gonna<00:01:15.750> be<00:01:15.840> a<00:01:15.870> little<00:01:15.990> shaky

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.080 

okay<00:01:29.380> hopefully<00:01:29.620> you<00:01:29.800> saw<00:01:30.070> that<00:01:30.340> I<00:01:30.610> have<00:01:30.880> the

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:31.090 
okay hopefully you saw that I have the

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:35.730 
okay hopefully you saw that I have the
color<00:01:31.330> you<00:01:31.840> know<00:01:32.680> spread<00:01:32.950> out<00:01:33.570> that's<00:01:34.570> 350<00:01:35.170> and

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:35.740 
color you know spread out that's 350 and

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:42.840 
color you know spread out that's 350 and
then<00:01:36.220> there's<00:01:36.490> one<00:01:36.670> be<00:01:36.910> mostly<00:01:39.120> yeah<00:01:40.120> oh<00:01:41.850> yeah

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:42.850 
then there's one be mostly yeah oh yeah

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:45.450 
then there's one be mostly yeah oh yeah
I<00:01:43.210> did<00:01:43.510> the<00:01:43.630> grayed<00:01:43.870> out<00:01:43.900> I<00:01:44.710> just<00:01:45.100> in<00:01:45.220> the<00:01:45.310> hot

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:45.460 
I did the grayed out I just in the hot

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:49.500 
I did the grayed out I just in the hot
water<00:01:45.730> and<00:01:46.180> I<00:01:46.630> think<00:01:46.690> because<00:01:47.380> I<00:01:47.950> cut<00:01:48.610> a<00:01:48.640> lot<00:01:49.060> a

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:49.510 
water and I think because I cut a lot a

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:52.680 
water and I think because I cut a lot a
lot<00:01:50.110> of<00:01:50.200> the<00:01:50.260> curls<00:01:50.560> you<00:01:51.010> know<00:01:51.160> it<00:01:52.120> was<00:01:52.270> cut<00:01:52.450> off

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:52.690 
lot of the curls you know it was cut off

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:57.770 
lot of the curls you know it was cut off
but<00:01:53.140> it's<00:01:53.350> fine<00:01:53.530> it's<00:01:53.800> still<00:01:53.920> decent<00:01:54.460> I<00:01:55.560> might

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
but it's fine it's still decent I might

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.120 
but it's fine it's still decent I might
get<00:01:58.780> a<00:01:58.840> scarf<00:01:59.230> or<00:01:59.410> something<00:01:59.650> to<00:01:59.770> cover<00:01:59.920> my

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.130 
get a scarf or something to cover my

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:01.920 
get a scarf or something to cover my
hair<00:02:00.310> at<00:02:00.400> night<00:02:00.460> I<00:02:00.760> don't<00:02:00.820> have<00:02:01.120> one<00:02:01.479> a<00:02:01.510> scarf

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:01.930 
hair at night I don't have one a scarf

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:07.710 
hair at night I don't have one a scarf
in<00:02:03.510> probably<00:02:04.560> over<00:02:05.560> a<00:02:05.590> year<00:02:05.760> no<00:02:06.760> more<00:02:07.510> than<00:02:07.690> a

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:07.720 
in probably over a year no more than a

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:08.219 
in probably over a year no more than a
year

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 
year

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:10.980 
year
definitely<00:02:08.890> cuz<00:02:09.670> I<00:02:09.790> had<00:02:10.179> my<00:02:10.300> hair<00:02:10.510> short<00:02:10.780> when

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:10.990 
definitely cuz I had my hair short when

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:12.900 
definitely cuz I had my hair short when
I<00:02:11.080> had<00:02:11.170> my<00:02:11.290> braids<00:02:11.590> I<00:02:11.800> just<00:02:11.980> slept<00:02:12.160> on<00:02:12.370> a<00:02:12.430> satin

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
I had my braids I just slept on a satin

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:17.160 
I had my braids I just slept on a satin
pillowcase<00:02:13.650> so<00:02:15.060> it<00:02:16.060> might<00:02:16.300> get<00:02:16.450> a<00:02:16.510> bonnet<00:02:17.020> or

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
pillowcase so it might get a bonnet or

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:18.810 
pillowcase so it might get a bonnet or
something<00:02:17.530> just<00:02:17.800> so<00:02:17.980> this<00:02:18.160> hair<00:02:18.400> doesn't<00:02:18.580> get

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:18.820 
something just so this hair doesn't get

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:22.170 
something just so this hair doesn't get
not<00:02:19.330> kind<00:02:19.570> of<00:02:19.600> rui-zhi<00:02:20.130> because<00:02:21.130> it's<00:02:21.310> already

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
not kind of rui-zhi because it's already

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.570 
not kind of rui-zhi because it's already
looking<00:02:22.360> very<00:02:23.080> natural<00:02:23.709> and<00:02:23.770> as<00:02:23.920> time<00:02:24.160> goes<00:02:24.190> on

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580 
looking very natural and as time goes on

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:27.180 
looking very natural and as time goes on
I<00:02:24.640> probably<00:02:24.970> look<00:02:25.209> even<00:02:25.450> more<00:02:25.600> natural<00:02:25.660> a<00:02:26.470> bit

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
I probably look even more natural a bit

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:29.190
