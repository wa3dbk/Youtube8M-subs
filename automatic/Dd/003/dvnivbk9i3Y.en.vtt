00:05:21.959 --> 00:05:21.969 
help miners It was as if you put into

00:05:21.969 --> 00:05:24.389 
help miners It was as if you put into
just<00:05:22.149> one<00:05:22.360> lever<00:05:22.809> one<00:05:23.110> beautiful<00:05:23.649> level<00:05:23.979> so

00:05:24.389 --> 00:05:24.399 
just one lever one beautiful level so

00:05:24.399 --> 00:05:26.069 
just one lever one beautiful level so
everything<00:05:24.909> would<00:05:24.999> go<00:05:25.119> perfectly<00:05:25.599> right<00:05:25.869> so

00:05:26.069 --> 00:05:26.079
