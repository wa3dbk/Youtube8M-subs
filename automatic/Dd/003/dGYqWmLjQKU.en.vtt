00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
potentially put your mind at ease see

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.959 
potentially put your mind at ease see
those<00:00:48.960> huge<00:00:49.379> heat<00:00:49.680> disbursement<00:00:50.280> fins<00:00:50.579> well

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
those huge heat disbursement fins well

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.760 
those huge heat disbursement fins well
I'm<00:00:51.180> not<00:00:51.360> quite<00:00:51.780> sure<00:00:51.809> they're<00:00:52.230> necessary

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
I'm not quite sure they're necessary

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.590 
I'm not quite sure they're necessary
because<00:00:52.980> I<00:00:53.129> left<00:00:53.430> them<00:00:53.579> on<00:00:53.699> for<00:00:54.000> over<00:00:54.180> eight

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
because I left them on for over eight

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.260 
because I left them on for over eight
hours<00:00:54.870> to<00:00:55.230> see<00:00:55.379> how<00:00:55.590> hot<00:00:55.920> they<00:00:56.160> got<00:00:56.399> and<00:00:56.640> they

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
hours to see how hot they got and they

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.180 
hours to see how hot they got and they
were<00:00:57.329> only<00:00:57.600> barely<00:00:58.109> warm<00:00:58.500> to<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:58.649> touch<00:00:58.739> so<00:00:58.949> I

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
were only barely warm to the touch so I

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.340 
were only barely warm to the touch so I
think<00:00:59.340> it's<00:01:00.000> safe<00:01:00.300> to<00:01:00.329> say<00:01:00.480> that<00:01:00.660> you<00:01:01.050> can<00:01:01.170> take

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
think it's safe to say that you can take

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.020 
think it's safe to say that you can take
comfort<00:01:01.530> in<00:01:01.770> knowing<00:01:01.829> that<00:01:02.100> they<00:01:02.460> won't<00:01:02.670> burn

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
comfort in knowing that they won't burn

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.700 
comfort in knowing that they won't burn
down<00:01:03.210> your<00:01:03.480> house<00:01:03.690> and<00:01:04.049> even<00:01:04.379> though<00:01:04.500> they're

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
down your house and even though they're

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.679 
down your house and even though they're
bulky<00:01:04.979> you<00:01:05.430> know<00:01:05.670> they<00:01:05.909> can<00:01:06.119> take<00:01:06.330> a<00:01:06.360> beating

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
bulky you know they can take a beating

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.359 
bulky you know they can take a beating
considering<00:01:07.439> they're<00:01:07.619> made<00:01:07.860> out<00:01:08.040> of<00:01:08.100> metal

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
considering they're made out of metal

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:09.789 
considering they're made out of metal
I'm<00:01:08.729> not<00:01:08.970> how<00:01:09.060> to<00:01:09.119> present<00:01:09.270> sure<00:01:09.510> but<00:01:09.689> I<00:01:09.720> think

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:09.799 
I'm not how to present sure but I think

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:12.560 
I'm not how to present sure but I think
aluminum<00:01:10.799> also<00:01:11.280> it<00:01:11.400> has<00:01:11.549> a<00:01:11.580> one<00:01:11.939> meter<00:01:12.299> long

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
aluminum also it has a one meter long

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.140 
aluminum also it has a one meter long
power<00:01:12.900> cable<00:01:13.350> as<00:01:13.500> well<00:01:13.799> as<00:01:14.040> a<00:01:14.340> wireless<00:01:14.939> remote

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
power cable as well as a wireless remote

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.359 
power cable as well as a wireless remote
control<00:01:15.840> with<00:01:16.049> a<00:01:16.080> bunch<00:01:16.320> of<00:01:16.470> colorful<00:01:16.890> buttons

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
control with a bunch of colorful buttons

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.399 
control with a bunch of colorful buttons
got<00:01:17.729> to<00:01:17.820> love<00:01:17.939> those<00:01:18.060> colorful<00:01:18.509> buttons<00:01:18.659> and

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
got to love those colorful buttons and

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:20.929 
got to love those colorful buttons and
each<00:01:19.560> lamp<00:01:19.799> you<00:01:20.009> get<00:01:20.189> comes<00:01:20.460> with<00:01:20.610> a<00:01:20.729> remote

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
each lamp you get comes with a remote

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.330 
each lamp you get comes with a remote
control<00:01:21.000> and<00:01:21.630> luckily<00:01:22.140> each<00:01:22.650> remote<00:01:22.979> sends

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
control and luckily each remote sends

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.190 
control and luckily each remote sends
the<00:01:23.430> same<00:01:23.610> signal<00:01:24.119> out<00:01:24.270> so<00:01:24.600> you<00:01:24.930> can<00:01:25.080> actually

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
the same signal out so you can actually

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.620 
the same signal out so you can actually
control<00:01:25.799> each<00:01:26.070> lamp<00:01:26.340> with<00:01:26.549> one<00:01:26.790> remote<00:01:26.939> and

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
control each lamp with one remote and

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.420 
control each lamp with one remote and

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
save the others as backups for later so

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.069

on<00:01:29.700> the<00:01:29.790> remote<00:01:30.000> itself<00:01:30.390> we've<00:01:30.540> obviously<00:01:30.659> got

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
on the remote itself we've obviously got

on the remote itself we've obviously got
the<00:01:31.140> on/off<00:01:31.829> buttons<00:01:32.280> and<00:01:32.430> right<00:01:32.549> beside

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
those is the brightness adjusters now

the first row of colored buttons are our

lamps<00:01:49.200> i<00:01:49.439> do<00:01:49.500> have<00:01:50.009> an<00:01:50.220> issue<00:01:50.340> with<00:01:50.579> the

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
lamps i do have an issue with the

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.819 
lamps i do have an issue with the
programming<00:01:51.450> of<00:01:51.509> the<00:01:51.570> different<00:01:51.990> modes<00:01:52.200> so

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
programming of the different modes so

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.109 
programming of the different modes so
for<00:01:52.950> instance<00:01:53.009> on<00:01:53.340> the<00:01:53.430> right<00:01:53.610> side<00:01:53.970> of<00:01:54.000> the

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
for instance on the right side of the

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.810 
for instance on the right side of the
remote<00:01:54.390> we've<00:01:54.540> got<00:01:54.720> flash<00:01:55.140> strobe<00:01:55.920> fade<00:01:56.549> and

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
remote we've got flash strobe fade and

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.149 
remote we've got flash strobe fade and
smooth<00:01:57.329> now<00:01:57.630> flash<00:01:58.259> mode<00:01:58.560> does<00:01:58.829> what<00:01:59.009> you

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
smooth now flash mode does what you

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.069 
smooth now flash mode does what you
think<00:01:59.490> just<00:01:59.670> flashes<00:02:00.479> the<00:02:00.540> different<00:02:00.810> colors

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
think just flashes the different colors

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.740 
think just flashes the different colors
in<00:02:01.200> sequence<00:02:01.700> strobe<00:02:02.700> mode<00:02:02.969> flashes<00:02:03.600> a<00:02:03.630> little

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
in sequence strobe mode flashes a little

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.230 
in sequence strobe mode flashes a little
faster<00:02:04.680> than<00:02:04.890> flash<00:02:05.159> mode<00:02:05.460> but<00:02:05.670> certainly<00:02:06.030> not

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
faster than flash mode but certainly not

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.719 
faster than flash mode but certainly not
as<00:02:06.390> fast<00:02:06.570> as<00:02:06.780> a<00:02:06.810> real<00:02:07.110> strobe<00:02:07.590> light<00:02:07.799> does<00:02:08.069> and

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
as fast as a real strobe light does and

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.210 
as fast as a real strobe light does and
it<00:02:08.819> only<00:02:08.940> flashes<00:02:09.479> white<00:02:09.810> nothing<00:02:10.500> else<00:02:10.890> which

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
it only flashes white nothing else which

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.240 
it only flashes white nothing else which
makes<00:02:11.550> it<00:02:11.640> probably<00:02:12.030> the<00:02:12.120> most<00:02:12.270> boring<00:02:12.360> mode

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
makes it probably the most boring mode

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.640 
makes it probably the most boring mode
fade<00:02:14.000> mode<00:02:14.330> basically<00:02:14.660> does<00:02:15.140> the<00:02:15.260> exact<00:02:15.620> same

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
fade mode basically does the exact same

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:18.130 
fade mode basically does the exact same
thing<00:02:16.190> as<00:02:16.340> flash<00:02:16.670> mode<00:02:16.970> by<00:02:17.150> flashing<00:02:17.690> all<00:02:17.870> the

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
thing as flash mode by flashing all the

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:19.720 
thing as flash mode by flashing all the
colors<00:02:18.410> in<00:02:18.530> sequence<00:02:19.190> but<00:02:19.310> with<00:02:19.580> a<00:02:19.610> very

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
colors in sequence but with a very

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.750 
colors in sequence but with a very
slight<00:02:20.450> fade<00:02:20.870> between<00:02:21.110> each<00:02:21.560> flash<00:02:22.070> and<00:02:22.580> then

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
slight fade between each flash and then

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.580 
slight fade between each flash and then
last<00:02:23.030> we<00:02:23.210> have<00:02:23.330> smooth<00:02:23.750> mode<00:02:24.110> which<00:02:24.320> again

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
last we have smooth mode which again

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:26.260 
last we have smooth mode which again
alternates<00:02:25.160> between<00:02:25.280> the<00:02:25.700> different<00:02:26.000> colors

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:26.270 
alternates between the different colors

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:28.690 
alternates between the different colors
but<00:02:26.300> should<00:02:26.720> probably<00:02:27.440> be<00:02:27.710> renamed<00:02:28.190> a<00:02:28.370> fade

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
but should probably be renamed a fade

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.060 
but should probably be renamed a fade
mode<00:02:28.910> because<00:02:29.120> this<00:02:29.570> one<00:02:29.750> actually<00:02:29.959> fades<00:02:30.890> the

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:31.070 
mode because this one actually fades the

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:33.370 
mode because this one actually fades the
colors<00:02:31.370> smoothly<00:02:31.790> but<00:02:32.600> unfortunately<00:02:33.140> in<00:02:33.230> my

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.380 
colors smoothly but unfortunately in my

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.320 
colors smoothly but unfortunately in my
opinion<00:02:33.680> it<00:02:33.890> doesn't<00:02:34.040> hold<00:02:34.370> the<00:02:34.610> colors<00:02:35.030> long

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 
opinion it doesn't hold the colors long

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.390 
opinion it doesn't hold the colors long
enough<00:02:35.660> before<00:02:36.080> switching<00:02:36.500> to<00:02:36.740> the<00:02:36.830> next<00:02:37.160> but

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
enough before switching to the next but

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:38.500 
enough before switching to the next but
to<00:02:37.520> be<00:02:37.610> honest<00:02:37.910> with<00:02:38.000> you<00:02:38.090> guys<00:02:38.300> I<00:02:38.480> never

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
to be honest with you guys I never

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.870 
to be honest with you guys I never
intended<00:02:39.140> to<00:02:39.200> use<00:02:39.290> any<00:02:39.709> fancy<00:02:40.190> color<00:02:40.400> changing

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:40.880 
intended to use any fancy color changing

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:42.370 
intended to use any fancy color changing
modes<00:02:41.090> so<00:02:41.480> i'll<00:02:41.630> just<00:02:41.810> be<00:02:41.900> switching<00:02:42.290> between

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.380 
modes so i'll just be switching between

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:44.260 
modes so i'll just be switching between
the<00:02:42.680> stationary<00:02:43.220> colors<00:02:43.640> and<00:02:43.850> i'll<00:02:43.940> be<00:02:44.090> more

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:44.270 
the stationary colors and i'll be more

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:46.090 
the stationary colors and i'll be more
than<00:02:44.330> happy<00:02:44.480> with<00:02:44.840> that<00:02:45.140> now<00:02:45.500> all<00:02:45.650> that<00:02:45.680> said<00:02:46.070> i

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.100 
than happy with that now all that said i

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:47.500 
than happy with that now all that said i
know<00:02:46.190> you<00:02:46.310> all<00:02:46.430> probably<00:02:46.790> wanted<00:02:47.270> to<00:02:47.300> see

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
know you all probably wanted to see

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:49.150 
know you all probably wanted to see

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
where and how i mounted these but

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:50.680 
where and how i mounted these but
unfortunately<00:02:49.760> i<00:02:49.820> don't<00:02:49.880> have<00:02:50.180> the<00:02:50.480> time<00:02:50.630> to
