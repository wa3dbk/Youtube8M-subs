00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
the way I was born and so I just thought

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.230 
the way I was born and so I just thought
I<00:01:43.530> don't<00:01:43.829> need<00:01:43.950> to<00:01:44.009> work<00:01:44.130> out<00:01:44.310> well<00:01:44.610> then<00:01:44.970> I<00:01:45.060> got

I don't need to work out well then I got
two<00:01:45.420> babies<00:01:45.780> started<00:01:46.560> to<00:01:46.649> get<00:01:46.740> older<00:01:47.039> and<00:01:47.250> I

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
two babies started to get older and I

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.240 
two babies started to get older and I
started<00:01:47.399> to<00:01:47.759> feel<00:01:48.179> like<00:01:48.470> my<00:01:49.470> body<00:01:49.740> was<00:01:49.860> of<00:01:50.130> my

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
started to feel like my body was of my

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.609 
started to feel like my body was of my
own<00:01:50.280> like<00:01:50.729> it<00:01:51.299> just<00:01:51.659> wasn't<00:01:51.780> me<00:01:52.110> and<00:01:52.350> so<00:01:52.590> I

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
own like it just wasn't me and so I

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.460
