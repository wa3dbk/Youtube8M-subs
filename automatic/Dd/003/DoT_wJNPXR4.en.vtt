so<00:00:06.009> I<00:00:06.040> wanted<00:00:06.279> to<00:00:06.430> share<00:00:06.549> a<00:00:06.609> quick<00:00:06.790> tip<00:00:07.120> on<00:00:07.240> how

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:07.420 
so I wanted to share a quick tip on how

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:09.660 
so I wanted to share a quick tip on how
you<00:00:07.479> go<00:00:07.750> about<00:00:07.840> modifying<00:00:08.500> either<00:00:08.799> an<00:00:09.010> NTSC

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:09.670 
you go about modifying either an NTSC

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:12.570 
you go about modifying either an NTSC
you<00:00:09.940> North<00:00:10.299> American<00:00:10.780> Dreamcast<00:00:11.230> or<00:00:11.580> Japanese

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:12.580 
you North American Dreamcast or Japanese

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:16.349 
you North American Dreamcast or Japanese
Dreamcast<00:00:13.119> work<00:00:13.480> in<00:00:13.660> Europe<00:00:14.459> or<00:00:15.459> vice<00:00:15.789> versa

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:16.359 
Dreamcast work in Europe or vice versa

00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:19.349 
Dreamcast work in Europe or vice versa
without<00:00:16.750> using<00:00:17.020> either<00:00:17.730> step<00:00:18.730> up<00:00:18.880> or<00:00:18.940> a<00:00:19.119> step

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:19.359 
without using either step up or a step

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:21.800 
without using either step up or a step
down<00:00:19.570> converter<00:00:19.720> and<00:00:20.560> the<00:00:20.680> problem<00:00:21.040> is<00:00:21.190> in

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
down converter and the problem is in

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.620 
down converter and the problem is in
America<00:00:22.810> or<00:00:23.110> in<00:00:23.310> Japan<00:00:24.310> they<00:00:25.120> use<00:00:25.330> a<00:00:25.360> different

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:25.630 
America or in Japan they use a different

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:28.500 
America or in Japan they use a different
main<00:00:25.990> supply<00:00:26.380> voltage<00:00:26.860> so<00:00:27.340> you<00:00:27.640> can<00:00:28.300> see<00:00:28.450> in

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:28.510 
main supply voltage so you can see in

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:30.410 
main supply voltage so you can see in
the<00:00:28.570> back<00:00:28.720> of<00:00:28.900> the<00:00:28.960> console<00:00:29.350> here<00:00:29.530> this<00:00:29.740> is<00:00:29.860> my

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
the back of the console here this is my

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.720 
the back of the console here this is my
NTSC<00:00:31.420> u<00:00:31.630> console<00:00:32.110> I'll<00:00:32.259> just<00:00:32.469> go<00:00:32.619> up<00:00:32.680> and<00:00:32.980> I'm

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:33.730 
NTSC u console I'll just go up and I'm

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:35.910 
NTSC u console I'll just go up and I'm
going<00:00:34.090> to<00:00:34.210> be<00:00:34.329> modifying<00:00:34.809> this<00:00:35.020> one<00:00:35.230> you<00:00:35.770> can

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:35.920 
going to be modifying this one you can

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.340 
going to be modifying this one you can
see<00:00:36.039> in<00:00:36.129> the<00:00:36.219> back<00:00:36.370> here<00:00:36.760> the<00:00:37.659> input<00:00:37.960> voltage

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:38.350 
see in the back here the input voltage

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.279 
see in the back here the input voltage
required<00:00:38.710> is<00:00:39.039> 120<00:00:39.789> volts<00:00:39.819> and<00:00:40.300> it's<00:00:40.839> the<00:00:41.079> same

00:00:41.279 --> 00:00:41.289 
required is 120 volts and it's the same

00:00:41.289 --> 00:00:45.540 
required is 120 volts and it's the same
for<00:00:41.319> the<00:00:42.219> Japanese<00:00:42.929> Jim<00:00:43.929> cast<00:00:44.170> as<00:00:44.379> well<00:00:44.559> but

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:45.550 
for the Japanese Jim cast as well but

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:47.819 
for the Japanese Jim cast as well but
here<00:00:45.969> in<00:00:46.059> Europe<00:00:46.390> our<00:00:46.539> main<00:00:46.989> supply<00:00:47.199> voltage

00:00:47.819 --> 00:00:47.829 
here in Europe our main supply voltage

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:51.660 
here in Europe our main supply voltage
is<00:00:48.510> 230<00:00:49.510> volts<00:00:49.629> so<00:00:50.139> I<00:00:50.350> turn<00:00:51.039> this<00:00:51.190> power

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:51.670 
is 230 volts so I turn this power

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:55.979 
is 230 volts so I turn this power
console<00:00:52.239> over<00:00:52.479> here<00:00:52.769> you<00:00:53.769> can<00:00:53.949> see<00:00:54.159> there<00:00:54.989> the

00:00:55.979 --> 00:00:55.989 
console over here you can see there the

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:58.919 
console over here you can see there the
input<00:00:56.350> voltage<00:00:56.799> for<00:00:56.829> this<00:00:57.129> is<00:00:57.370> 220<00:00:58.269> to<00:00:58.389> 240

00:00:58.919 --> 00:00:58.929 
input voltage for this is 220 to 240

00:00:58.929 --> 00:01:01.860 
input voltage for this is 220 to 240
volts<00:00:59.649> so<00:00:59.969> basically<00:01:00.969> what<00:01:01.179> would<00:01:01.269> happen<00:01:01.690> is

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:01.870 
volts so basically what would happen is

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:05.730 
volts so basically what would happen is
if<00:01:02.319> I<00:01:02.679> plug<00:01:02.979> in<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:04.690> power<00:01:04.900> supply<00:01:05.019> or<00:01:05.680> the

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:05.740 
if I plug in the power supply or the

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.969 
if I plug in the power supply or the
power<00:01:06.100> card<00:01:06.460> for<00:01:06.729> my<00:01:07.630> power<00:01:07.900> console<00:01:08.530> which<00:01:08.799> is

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:08.979 
power card for my power console which is

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:11.999 
power card for my power console which is
this<00:01:09.159> thing<00:01:09.219> here<00:01:09.610> this<00:01:09.880> is<00:01:10.030> the<00:01:10.149> UK<00:01:11.009> style

00:01:11.999 --> 00:01:12.009 
this thing here this is the UK style

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:15.620 
this thing here this is the UK style
plug<00:01:12.250> and<00:01:12.880> that's<00:01:13.060> just<00:01:13.240> a<00:01:13.360> standard<00:01:13.950> power

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
plug and that's just a standard power

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.420 
plug and that's just a standard power
adapter<00:01:16.630> thing<00:01:16.840> there<00:01:17.079> if<00:01:17.649> I<00:01:17.770> plug<00:01:18.009> this<00:01:18.189> into

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:18.430 
adapter thing there if I plug this into

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:21.240 
adapter thing there if I plug this into
the<00:01:18.789> American<00:01:19.659> or<00:01:19.869> the<00:01:19.899> Japanese<00:01:20.619> Dreamcast

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:21.250 
the American or the Japanese Dreamcast

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.420 
the American or the Japanese Dreamcast
they<00:01:21.490> modify<00:01:21.969> my<00:01:22.119> first<00:01:22.420> it<00:01:23.259> would<00:01:23.530> blow<00:01:24.219> up

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:24.430 
they modify my first it would blow up

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:27.330 
they modify my first it would blow up
the<00:01:24.700> the<00:01:25.420> power<00:01:25.600> supply<00:01:25.930> unit<00:01:26.259> and<00:01:26.950> basically

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:27.340 
the the power supply unit and basically

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:30.240 
the the power supply unit and basically
make<00:01:27.729> it<00:01:27.880> unusable<00:01:28.090> and<00:01:28.810> so<00:01:29.619> what<00:01:29.890> you<00:01:29.979> usually

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:30.250 
make it unusable and so what you usually

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:33.719 
make it unusable and so what you usually
use<00:01:30.670> is<00:01:30.969> this<00:01:31.689> thing<00:01:31.930> here<00:01:32.229> and<00:01:32.520> this<00:01:33.520> is<00:01:33.700> a

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:33.729 
use is this thing here and this is a

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:36.419 
use is this thing here and this is a
step-down<00:01:34.359> converter<00:01:35.009> as<00:01:36.009> you<00:01:36.100> can<00:01:36.250> see<00:01:36.369> you

00:01:36.419 --> 00:01:36.429 
step-down converter as you can see you

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:38.069 
step-down converter as you can see you
can<00:01:36.579> use<00:01:36.700> this<00:01:36.820> on<00:01:36.969> a<00:01:37.090> bunch<00:01:37.810> of<00:01:37.960> different

00:01:38.069 --> 00:01:38.079 
can use this on a bunch of different

00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:40.679 
can use this on a bunch of different
consoles<00:01:38.710> but<00:01:39.119> what<00:01:40.119> this<00:01:40.240> does<00:01:40.479> is<00:01:40.539> it<00:01:40.630> will

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:40.689 
consoles but what this does is it will

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:44.490 
consoles but what this does is it will
take<00:01:40.840> the<00:01:40.899> 230<00:01:41.560> volt<00:01:42.390> European<00:01:43.390> voltage<00:01:44.229> mains

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:44.500 
take the 230 volt European voltage mains

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.940 
take the 230 volt European voltage mains
voltage<00:01:44.890> and<00:01:45.130> step<00:01:45.670> it<00:01:45.820> down<00:01:45.850> to<00:01:46.359> 100<00:01:47.259> volts<00:01:47.289> so

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:47.950 
voltage and step it down to 100 volts so

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.429 
voltage and step it down to 100 volts so
you<00:01:48.039> could<00:01:48.219> then<00:01:48.369> use<00:01:48.609> this<00:01:48.850> one<00:01:49.149> to<00:01:50.020> power

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:50.439 
you could then use this one to power

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:53.190 
you could then use this one to power
your<00:01:50.740> your<00:01:51.130> Japanese<00:01:51.999> or<00:01:52.179> American<00:01:52.420> Dreamcast

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:53.200 
your your Japanese or American Dreamcast

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.249 
your your Japanese or American Dreamcast
and<00:01:53.439> then<00:01:54.219> you<00:01:54.670> can<00:01:54.820> see<00:01:54.999> here<00:01:55.240> let's<00:01:55.899> just<00:01:56.109> go

00:01:56.249 --> 00:01:56.259 
and then you can see here let's just go

00:01:56.259 --> 00:01:58.830 
and then you can see here let's just go
an<00:01:56.499> adapter<00:01:57.219> for<00:01:57.340> the<00:01:57.399> plug<00:01:57.640> and<00:01:57.939> your

00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:58.840 
an adapter for the plug and your

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.739 
an adapter for the plug and your
standard<00:01:59.289> power<00:01:59.740> cord<00:02:00.039> but<00:02:00.909> this<00:02:01.090> is<00:02:01.270> really

00:02:01.739 --> 00:02:01.749 
standard power cord but this is really

00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:04.739 
standard power cord but this is really
bulky<00:02:02.200> and<00:02:02.880> generates<00:02:03.880> heat<00:02:04.210> and<00:02:04.479> noise<00:02:04.689> and

00:02:04.739 --> 00:02:04.749 
bulky and generates heat and noise and

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:06.690 
bulky and generates heat and noise and
all<00:02:05.319> this<00:02:05.770> one<00:02:06.009> does<00:02:06.219> because<00:02:06.429> it's<00:02:06.549> broken

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:06.700 
all this one does because it's broken

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.240 
all this one does because it's broken
but<00:02:07.259> you've<00:02:08.259> got<00:02:08.380> all<00:02:08.470> these<00:02:08.590> extra<00:02:08.770> wires

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
but you've got all these extra wires

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.240 
but you've got all these extra wires
everywhere<00:02:09.550> and<00:02:10.030> it's<00:02:10.560> not<00:02:11.560> nice<00:02:11.770> to<00:02:11.980> look<00:02:12.069> at

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
everywhere and it's not nice to look at

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.140

so what I've gone ahead and done is
brought<00:03:06.610> myself<00:03:06.790> on<00:03:07.150> power

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:07.690 
brought myself on power

it's the same connect connector that's

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.550 
it's the same connect connector that's
on<00:03:15.070> all<00:03:15.370> regions<00:03:15.970> of<00:03:16.090> Jim<00:03:16.269> cast<00:03:16.510> and<00:03:16.840> then<00:03:17.410> the

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
on all regions of Jim cast and then the

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:18.840 
on all regions of Jim cast and then the
front<00:03:17.769> here<00:03:17.950> is<00:03:18.010> where<00:03:18.160> actually<00:03:18.430> plugs<00:03:18.670> into

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:18.850 
front here is where actually plugs into

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:21.420 
front here is where actually plugs into
your<00:03:19.090> your<00:03:19.269> motherboard<00:03:19.600> so<00:03:20.560> these<00:03:21.280> are

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430 
your your motherboard so these are

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:22.800 
your your motherboard so these are
pretty<00:03:21.549> easy<00:03:21.730> to<00:03:21.970> get<00:03:22.120> hold<00:03:22.299> of<00:03:22.450> you<00:03:22.630> can<00:03:22.720> get

pretty easy to get hold of you can get

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:24.780 
pretty easy to get hold of you can get
them<00:03:22.930> on<00:03:23.019> eBay<00:03:23.350> or<00:03:23.590> you<00:03:24.130> can<00:03:24.280> just<00:03:24.459> sell<00:03:24.610> which

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790

is<00:03:24.910> I'm<00:03:25.030> from<00:03:25.180> faulty<00:03:26.170> Dreamcast<00:03:26.769> so<00:03:26.950> so

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:27.100 
is I'm from faulty Dreamcast so so

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:29.490 
is I'm from faulty Dreamcast so so
you've<00:03:27.250> got<00:03:27.400> a<00:03:27.430> Dreamcast<00:03:28.360> with<00:03:28.540> a<00:03:28.570> faulty

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
you've got a Dreamcast with a faulty

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.069 
you've got a Dreamcast with a faulty
desk<00:03:29.739> drive<00:03:30.040> you<00:03:30.220> can<00:03:30.370> just<00:03:30.690> take<00:03:31.690> the<00:03:31.840> the

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:32.079 
desk drive you can just take the the

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:34.009 
desk drive you can just take the the
power<00:03:32.260> supply<00:03:32.620> through<00:03:32.920> that<00:03:33.130> and<00:03:33.519> use<00:03:33.760> that

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:34.019 
power supply through that and use that

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:36.630 
power supply through that and use that
so<00:03:35.019> what<00:03:35.590> I'm<00:03:35.680> going<00:03:35.799> to<00:03:35.829> do<00:03:35.950> here<00:03:36.220> is<00:03:36.400> just

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:36.640 
so what I'm going to do here is just

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:39.690 
so what I'm going to do here is just
flat<00:03:37.030> the<00:03:37.150> Dreamcast<00:03:37.540> over<00:03:37.870> and<00:03:38.640> remove<00:03:39.640> the

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 
flat the Dreamcast over and remove the

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.600 
flat the Dreamcast over and remove the
more<00:03:40.420> dem<00:03:40.600> there's<00:03:41.049> a<00:03:41.110> screw<00:03:41.739> underneath<00:03:42.280> that

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:42.610 
more dem there's a screw underneath that

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:44.729 
more dem there's a screw underneath that
so<00:03:42.940> you<00:03:43.000> take<00:03:43.269> a<00:03:43.299> throw<00:03:43.630> on<00:03:44.049> this<00:03:44.260> one<00:03:44.470> it<00:03:44.560> was<00:03:44.650> a

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:44.739 
so you take a throw on this one it was a

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:46.979 
so you take a throw on this one it was a
security<00:03:45.280> bit<00:03:45.670> so<00:03:45.820> you<00:03:45.910> might<00:03:46.060> need<00:03:46.180> a<00:03:46.239> special

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:46.989 
security bit so you might need a special

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:49.110 
security bit so you might need a special
screwdriver<00:03:47.230> to<00:03:47.590> get<00:03:47.680> that<00:03:47.860> out<00:03:48.010> and<00:03:48.220> but<00:03:49.030> the

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:49.120 
screwdriver to get that out and but the

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:50.460 
screwdriver to get that out and but the
rest<00:03:49.269> of<00:03:49.420> them<00:03:49.540> are<00:03:49.720> all<00:03:49.840> just<00:03:50.260> regular

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:50.470 
rest of them are all just regular

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:52.590 
rest of them are all just regular
Phillips<00:03:51.220> head<00:03:51.430> screws<00:03:51.760> so<00:03:52.120> there's<00:03:52.299> one<00:03:52.480> in

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:52.600 
Phillips head screws so there's one in

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:55.530 
Phillips head screws so there's one in
each<00:03:52.720> corner<00:03:52.959> so<00:03:53.290> once<00:03:54.070> you've<00:03:54.220> done<00:03:54.340> that<00:03:54.540> you

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:55.540 
each corner so once you've done that you

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:57.360 
each corner so once you've done that you
just<00:03:55.570> put<00:03:55.989> the<00:03:56.079> Jim<00:03:56.260> cast<00:03:56.470> down<00:03:56.680> and<00:03:56.829> you<00:03:57.130> can

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:57.370 
just put the Jim cast down and you can

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:00.150 
just put the Jim cast down and you can
simply<00:03:57.910> left<00:03:58.180> the<00:03:58.560> top<00:03:59.560> part<00:03:59.799> of<00:03:59.860> the<00:03:59.950> shell

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:00.160 
simply left the top part of the shell

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.240 
simply left the top part of the shell
off<00:04:00.370> and<00:04:00.640> you<00:04:01.329> can<00:04:01.480> see<00:04:01.510> on<00:04:01.750> this<00:04:01.870> one<00:04:02.110> this<00:04:03.040> is

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:03.250 
off and you can see on this one this is

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:05.670 
off and you can see on this one this is
actually<00:04:03.670> got<00:04:04.120> a<00:04:04.299> faulty<00:04:04.810> power<00:04:04.989> supply<00:04:05.380> unit

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:05.680 
actually got a faulty power supply unit

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.130 
actually got a faulty power supply unit
and<00:04:05.829> it<00:04:05.920> already<00:04:06.070> you<00:04:06.940> can<00:04:07.120> see<00:04:07.329> further<00:04:07.750> or

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:08.140 
and it already you can see further or

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:10.800 
and it already you can see further or
you<00:04:08.170> can<00:04:08.650> maybe<00:04:08.829> see<00:04:08.950> whether<00:04:09.400> the<00:04:10.180> capacitor

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:10.810 
you can maybe see whether the capacitor

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:12.750 
you can maybe see whether the capacitor
is<00:04:10.870> going<00:04:11.079> to<00:04:11.140> blown<00:04:11.410> it<00:04:11.590> across<00:04:11.920> the<00:04:12.190> top<00:04:12.730> of

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:12.760 
is going to blown it across the top of

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:16.140 
is going to blown it across the top of
the<00:04:13.060> shell<00:04:13.480> they're<00:04:13.750> solid<00:04:14.290> ugly<00:04:14.700> so<00:04:15.700> what

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:16.150 
the shell they're solid ugly so what

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:17.460 
the shell they're solid ugly so what
you're<00:04:16.239> going<00:04:16.359> to<00:04:16.390> do<00:04:16.539> here<00:04:16.810> is<00:04:17.019> just<00:04:17.200> remove

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:17.470 
you're going to do here is just remove

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:19.680 
you're going to do here is just remove
the<00:04:17.620> old<00:04:17.769> power<00:04:18.070> supply<00:04:18.400> unit<00:04:18.729> in<00:04:19.209> this<00:04:19.419> case

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:19.690 
the old power supply unit in this case

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:24.150 
the old power supply unit in this case
this<00:04:20.320> is<00:04:20.380> the<00:04:21.270> ntsc<00:04:22.270> you<00:04:22.510> power<00:04:23.500> supply<00:04:23.860> unit

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:24.160 
this is the ntsc you power supply unit

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:25.680 
this is the ntsc you power supply unit
and<00:04:24.280> i<00:04:24.340> want<00:04:24.520> to<00:04:24.610> replace<00:04:24.850> this<00:04:25.030> with<00:04:25.240> the

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:25.690 
and i want to replace this with the

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:28.880 
and i want to replace this with the
power<00:04:25.870> one<00:04:26.169> so<00:04:26.919> really<00:04:27.760> easy<00:04:28.030> to<00:04:28.240> do<00:04:28.390> there's<00:04:28.690> a

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:28.890 
power one so really easy to do there's a

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:30.910 
power one so really easy to do there's a
connector<00:04:29.890> here<00:04:29.919> you<00:04:30.310> just<00:04:30.550> pop

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:30.920 
connector here you just pop

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:33.850 
connector here you just pop
I fell<00:04:31.160> like<00:04:31.550> so<00:04:32.420> and<00:04:32.660> there's<00:04:33.260> a<00:04:33.320> screw<00:04:33.590> under

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:33.860 
I fell like so and there's a screw under

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:35.500 
I fell like so and there's a screw under
there<00:04:34.070> and<00:04:34.310> there's<00:04:34.670> one<00:04:34.910> at<00:04:34.940> the<00:04:35.120> front<00:04:35.360> as

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:35.510 
there and there's one at the front as

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:38.980 
there and there's one at the front as
well<00:04:35.660> so<00:04:35.960> just<00:04:36.770> unscrew<00:04:36.950> those<00:04:37.690> use<00:04:38.690> my

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:38.990 
well so just unscrew those use my

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:41.770 
well so just unscrew those use my
Phillips<00:04:39.320> head<00:04:39.500> screwdriver<00:04:40.630> quickly<00:04:41.630> do

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:41.780 
Phillips head screwdriver quickly do

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:53.980 
Phillips head screwdriver quickly do
that<00:04:43.270> that's<00:04:44.270> one<00:04:46.570> and<00:04:47.570> two<00:04:52.540> I'll<00:04:53.540> go<00:04:53.750> and<00:04:53.960> then

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:53.990 
that that's one and two I'll go and then

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:58.180 
that that's one and two I'll go and then
are<00:04:54.740> you<00:04:54.890> those<00:04:55.070> just<00:04:56.290> pop<00:04:57.290> that<00:04:57.320> off<00:04:57.530> like

00:04:58.180 --> 00:04:58.190 
are you those just pop that off like

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:00.910 
are you those just pop that off like
that<00:04:58.370> so<00:04:58.610> that's<00:04:58.790> the<00:04:58.940> old<00:04:59.200> power<00:05:00.200> supply<00:05:00.560> unit

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:00.920 
that so that's the old power supply unit

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:03.430 
that so that's the old power supply unit
there<00:05:01.210> you<00:05:02.210> can<00:05:02.390> see<00:05:02.570> where<00:05:02.750> the<00:05:02.840> capacitor

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:03.440 
there you can see where the capacitor

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:06.160 
there you can see where the capacitor
amount<00:05:03.740> when<00:05:03.830> you<00:05:03.920> blown<00:05:04.130> up<00:05:04.310> I<00:05:05.050> don't<00:05:06.050> know<00:05:06.110> if

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:06.170 
amount when you blown up I don't know if

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:09.040 
amount when you blown up I don't know if
maybe<00:05:06.290> someone<00:05:06.590> had<00:05:06.860> plug<00:05:07.220> that<00:05:07.370> into<00:05:07.580> the<00:05:08.050> UK

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:09.050 
maybe someone had plug that into the UK

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:11.770 
maybe someone had plug that into the UK
mains<00:05:09.320> voltage<00:05:09.800> or<00:05:10.310> means<00:05:10.550> supply<00:05:11.390> and<00:05:11.630> that's

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:11.780 
mains voltage or means supply and that's

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:14.980 
mains voltage or means supply and that's
what's<00:05:12.020> caused<00:05:12.260> it<00:05:12.410> to<00:05:12.670> die<00:05:13.670> but<00:05:14.000> whatever

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:14.990 
what's caused it to die but whatever

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:17.410 
what's caused it to die but whatever
we've<00:05:15.320> got<00:05:15.350> the<00:05:15.560> new<00:05:15.710> one<00:05:15.860> here<00:05:16.160> so<00:05:17.090> go<00:05:17.330> ahead

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:17.420 
we've got the new one here so go ahead

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:24.660 
we've got the new one here so go ahead
and<00:05:17.570> just<00:05:17.960> pop<00:05:18.410> that<00:05:18.620> into<00:05:18.830> place<00:05:22.030> like<00:05:23.030> so<00:05:23.090> and

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:24.670 
and just pop that into place like so and

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:29.340 
and just pop that into place like so and
then<00:05:25.670> I<00:05:25.790> can<00:05:25.970> go<00:05:26.090> ahead<00:05:26.120> and<00:05:26.570> screw<00:05:27.320> it<00:05:27.380> back<00:05:27.470> in

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:29.350 
then I can go ahead and screw it back in

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:32.680 
then I can go ahead and screw it back in
it'll<00:05:30.350> be<00:05:30.410> really<00:05:30.530> easy<00:05:30.650> to<00:05:30.890> do<00:05:31.270> it's<00:05:32.270> Norway

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:32.690 
it'll be really easy to do it's Norway

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:36.660 
it'll be really easy to do it's Norway
so<00:05:33.050> we'll<00:05:33.170> bring<00:05:33.350> her<00:05:33.470> anything<00:05:33.680> like<00:05:33.950> that

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:36.670 

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:39.700 

and<00:05:37.670> just<00:05:37.730> pop<00:05:38.630> up<00:05:38.810> we'll<00:05:39.110> connect<00:05:39.410> the<00:05:39.530> back

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:39.710 
and just pop up we'll connect the back

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:44.860 
and just pop up we'll connect the back
on<00:05:39.920> as<00:05:40.040> well<00:05:41.740> so<00:05:42.740> now<00:05:42.860> I<00:05:42.890> can<00:05:43.100> go<00:05:43.220> ahead<00:05:43.250> and<00:05:43.870> put

and test out like it should I should be

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:53.380 
and test out like it should I should be
able<00:05:49.400> to<00:05:49.520> no<00:05:49.700> play<00:05:50.200> my<00:05:51.200> American<00:05:51.970> games<00:05:52.970> with

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:53.390 
able to no play my American games with

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:56.410 
able to no play my American games with
just<00:05:53.810> the<00:05:53.930> regular<00:05:54.580> power<00:05:55.580> cord<00:05:55.940> hooked<00:05:56.150> up<00:05:56.300> to

just the regular power cord hooked up to

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:58.180 
just the regular power cord hooked up to
the<00:05:56.540> the<00:05:56.720> Dreamcast<00:05:57.140> oh<00:05:57.380> I'll<00:05:57.650> check<00:05:57.710> that<00:05:57.980> in

00:05:58.180 --> 00:05:58.190 
the the Dreamcast oh I'll check that in

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:01.330 
the the Dreamcast oh I'll check that in
just<00:05:58.460> a<00:05:58.550> second<00:05:59.650> so<00:06:00.650> it's<00:06:00.740> already<00:06:00.890> assembled

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:01.340 
just a second so it's already assembled

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:02.890 
just a second so it's already assembled
now<00:06:01.490> I<00:06:01.520> can<00:06:01.790> go<00:06:01.880> ahead<00:06:02.120> fire<00:06:02.360> up<00:06:02.600> make<00:06:02.870> sure

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:02.900 
now I can go ahead fire up make sure

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:05.890 
now I can go ahead fire up make sure
I'll<00:06:03.200> work<00:06:03.410> so<00:06:03.710> I'll<00:06:03.980> just<00:06:04.100> turn<00:06:04.280> it<00:06:04.430> on<00:06:04.900> and

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:05.900 
I'll work so I'll just turn it on and
