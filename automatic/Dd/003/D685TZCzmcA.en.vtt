going<00:02:09.489> to<00:02:09.580> expand<00:02:09.910> right<00:02:10.119> on<00:02:10.239> up<00:02:10.420> so<00:02:10.720> basically

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 
going to expand right on up so basically

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:21.930 
going to expand right on up so basically
it's<00:02:11.739> just<00:02:11.920> pouring<00:02:12.190> some<00:02:12.430> water<00:02:12.459> in<00:02:12.850> here<00:02:20.940> to

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
it's just pouring some water in here to

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:29.550 
it's just pouring some water in here to
get<00:02:22.090> them<00:02:22.209> started<00:02:28.080> see<00:02:29.080> how<00:02:29.140> they<00:02:29.260> just<00:02:29.290> pop

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
get them started see how they just pop

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:30.660 
get them started see how they just pop
right<00:02:29.590> up<00:02:29.769> but<00:02:30.130> not<00:02:30.280> cool

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
right up but not cool

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:48.309 
right up but not cool
it'll<00:02:31.209> take<00:02:31.330> a<00:02:31.360> couple<00:02:31.450> minutes<00:02:31.780> here

00:02:48.309 --> 00:02:48.319 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:50.649 

and<00:02:48.860> then<00:02:49.040> I<00:02:49.099> just<00:02:49.370> kind<00:02:49.549> of<00:02:49.610> once<00:02:50.269> they<00:02:50.390> pop<00:02:50.629> up

00:02:50.649 --> 00:02:50.659 
and then I just kind of once they pop up

00:02:50.659 --> 00:02:53.979 
and then I just kind of once they pop up
so<00:02:51.049> high<00:02:52.090> just<00:02:53.090> work<00:02:53.239> kind<00:02:53.450> of<00:02:53.480> working<00:02:53.840> a

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:53.989 
so high just work kind of working a

00:02:53.989 --> 00:03:00.399 
so high just work kind of working a
little<00:02:54.110> bit<00:02:54.290> loose<00:02:54.620> here<00:02:59.260> especially<00:03:00.260> near

00:03:00.399 --> 00:03:00.409 
little bit loose here especially near

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:03.490 
little bit loose here especially near
the<00:03:00.530> bottom<00:03:00.769> and<00:03:01.069> that<00:03:01.370> these<00:03:02.140> these<00:03:03.140> have<00:03:03.290> got

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 
the bottom and that these these have got

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.020 
the bottom and that these these have got
big<00:03:03.860> holes<00:03:04.099> in<00:03:04.280> the<00:03:04.370> bottom<00:03:04.700> of<00:03:04.849> them<00:03:04.940> of

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.030 
big holes in the bottom of them of

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:07.170 
big holes in the bottom of them of
course<00:03:05.060> for<00:03:05.329> the<00:03:05.420> water<00:03:05.629> can<00:03:05.810> be<00:03:05.900> soaked<00:03:06.170> up<00:03:06.319> in

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
course for the water can be soaked up in

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.580 
course for the water can be soaked up in
so<00:03:08.180> if<00:03:08.299> you<00:03:08.420> do<00:03:08.540> this<00:03:08.690> you<00:03:08.900> kind<00:03:09.079> of<00:03:09.140> plug<00:03:09.470> that

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590 
so if you do this you kind of plug that

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:13.030 
so if you do this you kind of plug that
hole<00:03:09.650> up<00:03:09.950> a<00:03:10.069> little<00:03:10.250> bit<00:03:11.230> and<00:03:12.230> then<00:03:12.769> it's<00:03:12.890> able

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 
hole up a little bit and then it's able

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.640 
hole up a little bit and then it's able
to<00:03:13.159> keep<00:03:13.840> water<00:03:14.840> in<00:03:15.019> the<00:03:15.109> tray<00:03:15.290> a<00:03:15.319> little<00:03:15.560> bit

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.650 
to keep water in the tray a little bit

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:19.210 
to keep water in the tray a little bit
better<00:03:15.799> and<00:03:16.010> of<00:03:16.159> course<00:03:16.400> then<00:03:18.129> loosens<00:03:19.129> them

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220 
better and of course then loosens them

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:34.690 
better and of course then loosens them
up<00:03:19.400> even<00:03:19.640> more<00:03:31.239> so<00:03:32.239> now<00:03:32.920> we've<00:03:33.920> got<00:03:34.099> our<00:03:34.129> soil

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:34.700 
up even more so now we've got our soil

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:44.140 
up even more so now we've got our soil
prepared<00:03:35.269> sort<00:03:36.079> of<00:03:38.590> it's<00:03:39.590> time<00:03:42.879> put<00:03:43.879> the<00:03:43.909> seeds

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.150 
prepared sort of it's time put the seeds

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:48.520 
prepared sort of it's time put the seeds
in<00:03:46.239> and<00:03:47.239> here<00:03:47.420> the<00:03:47.540> seeds<00:03:47.780> this<00:03:47.989> is<00:03:48.109> what<00:03:48.260> comes

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:48.530 
in and here the seeds this is what comes

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:50.800 
in and here the seeds this is what comes
in<00:03:48.799> little<00:03:49.370> package<00:03:49.730> like<00:03:49.909> yes<00:03:50.120> tomato<00:03:50.480> super

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:50.810 
in little package like yes tomato super

00:03:50.810 --> 00:04:13.069 
in little package like yes tomato super
sauce<00:03:50.989> hybrid<00:03:51.440> from<00:03:51.980> Burpee<00:03:52.690> 25<00:03:53.690> seeds

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:13.079 

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:17.659 

and<00:04:14.079> it's<00:04:14.200> just<00:04:14.319> like<00:04:14.560> a<00:04:14.590> regular<00:04:15.579> tomato<00:04:16.120> seed

00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:17.669 
and it's just like a regular tomato seed

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:22.310 
and it's just like a regular tomato seed
not<00:04:18.669> real<00:04:18.910> big<00:04:19.799> kind<00:04:20.799> of<00:04:20.859> surprising<00:04:21.400> actually

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320 
not real big kind of surprising actually

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.870 
not real big kind of surprising actually
so<00:04:23.320> I'm<00:04:23.919> gonna<00:04:24.070> go<00:04:24.190> through<00:04:24.250> the<00:04:24.430> cone<00:04:24.580> marker

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:24.880 
so I'm gonna go through the cone marker

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:27.090 
so I'm gonna go through the cone marker
here<00:04:25.060> and<00:04:25.180> I'm<00:04:25.240> gonna<00:04:25.330> put<00:04:25.389> a<00:04:25.570> little<00:04:25.780> hole<00:04:26.530> in

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:27.100 
here and I'm gonna put a little hole in

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:33.330 
here and I'm gonna put a little hole in
here<00:04:31.259> you<00:04:32.259> can<00:04:32.350> only<00:04:32.440> put<00:04:32.889> these<00:04:33.009> things<00:04:33.190> down

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:33.340 
here you can only put these things down

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:36.840 
here you can only put these things down
about<00:04:34.060> a<00:04:34.090> quarter<00:04:34.539> inch<00:04:35.370> it<00:04:36.370> seems<00:04:36.550> like<00:04:36.699> I

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:36.850 
about a quarter inch it seems like I

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:41.909 
about a quarter inch it seems like I
always<00:04:38.699> plant<00:04:39.699> my<00:04:39.940> plants<00:04:40.440> no<00:04:41.440> matter<00:04:41.650> what

00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:41.919 
always plant my plants no matter what

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:44.370 
always plant my plants no matter what
they<00:04:42.070> are<00:04:42.100> a<00:04:42.520> little<00:04:43.000> bit<00:04:43.210> deeper<00:04:43.570> than<00:04:43.690> normal

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:44.380 
they are a little bit deeper than normal

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:47.700 
they are a little bit deeper than normal
they<00:04:44.860> always<00:04:45.010> seem<00:04:45.250> to<00:04:45.280> do<00:04:45.460> pretty<00:04:45.490> good<00:04:46.680> so<00:04:47.680> I

don't<00:04:47.889> guess<00:04:48.010> it<00:04:48.130> really<00:04:48.250> hurts<00:04:48.639> them<00:04:48.789> but

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:48.910 
don't guess it really hurts them but

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:52.170 
don't guess it really hurts them but
they<00:04:49.000> only<00:04:49.180> really<00:04:49.449> actually<00:04:49.539> need<00:04:51.090> you<00:04:52.090> know

00:05:05.129 --> 00:05:05.139 
to put one seed per pot know if that was

00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:09.870 
to put one seed per pot know if that was
-<00:05:06.210> yeah<00:05:07.210> one<00:05:07.930> seed<00:05:08.229> per<00:05:08.500> freaking<00:05:09.340> pollo<00:05:09.550> that

00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:13.830 
this but this is self watering I mean

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:16.220 
this but this is self watering I mean
I've<00:07:13.980> got<00:07:14.220> this<00:07:14.340> little<00:07:14.810> black<00:07:15.810> piece<00:07:15.990> down

00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:16.230 
I've got this little black piece down

00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:18.230 
I've got this little black piece down
here<00:07:16.290> that<00:07:16.650> collects<00:07:17.250> water<00:07:17.340> it<00:07:17.730> comes<00:07:17.970> up<00:07:18.150> to

00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:18.240 
here that collects water it comes up to

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:19.610 
here that collects water it comes up to
the<00:07:18.330> bottom<00:07:18.600> of<00:07:18.660> the<00:07:18.780> pots<00:07:18.990> and<00:07:19.170> then<00:07:19.290> the<00:07:19.380> pots

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:19.620 
the bottom of the pots and then the pots

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:21.140 
the bottom of the pots and then the pots
suck<00:07:19.890> the<00:07:20.010> water<00:07:20.130> up<00:07:20.400> the<00:07:20.550> core<00:07:20.760> in<00:07:20.940> here

00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:21.150 
suck the water up the core in here

00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:22.550 
suck the water up the core in here
actually<00:07:21.480> sucks<00:07:21.690> the<00:07:21.810> water<00:07:21.930> right<00:07:22.230> up<00:07:22.350> to<00:07:22.440> the

00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:22.560 
actually sucks the water right up to the

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:24.500 
actually sucks the water right up to the
seed<00:07:22.770> so<00:07:23.340> I'm<00:07:23.550> really<00:07:23.850> not<00:07:23.970> that<00:07:24.210> worried

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:24.510 
seed so I'm really not that worried

00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:27.620 
seed so I'm really not that worried
about<00:07:24.570> it<00:07:25.190> my<00:07:26.190> pepper<00:07:26.460> plants<00:07:26.550> you<00:07:27.180> know<00:07:27.270> I<00:07:27.300> had

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:27.630 
about it my pepper plants you know I had

00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:29.750 
about it my pepper plants you know I had
to<00:07:27.720> cover<00:07:27.900> on<00:07:28.170> it<00:07:28.200> I<00:07:28.530> really<00:07:29.400> don't<00:07:29.490> think<00:07:29.610> I

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:29.760 
to cover on it I really don't think I

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:32.210 
to cover on it I really don't think I
needed<00:07:29.940> it<00:07:30.120> if<00:07:30.380> if<00:07:31.380> I<00:07:31.530> think<00:07:31.590> that<00:07:31.860> I<00:07:31.920> need<00:07:32.100> it

00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:32.220 
needed it if if I think that I need it

00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:34.010 
needed it if if I think that I need it
then<00:07:32.460> I'll<00:07:32.610> go<00:07:33.240> ahead<00:07:33.300> and<00:07:33.480> put<00:07:33.600> it<00:07:33.690> on<00:07:33.780> there

00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:34.020 
then I'll go ahead and put it on there

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:35.600 
then I'll go ahead and put it on there
