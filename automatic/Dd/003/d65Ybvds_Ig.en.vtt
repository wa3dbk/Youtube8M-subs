00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
over by by using these three fingers

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.029 
over by by using these three fingers
here<00:00:45.329> as<00:00:45.480> kind<00:00:45.840> of<00:00:45.870> a<00:00:45.989> gauge<00:00:46.200> you<00:00:46.559> can<00:00:46.739> feel<00:00:47.010> how

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
here as kind of a gauge you can feel how

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.950 
here as kind of a gauge you can feel how
many<00:00:47.430> cards<00:00:47.700> you're<00:00:47.910> pushing<00:00:48.180> over<00:00:48.450> all<00:00:48.809> you

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
many cards you're pushing over all you

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.450 
many cards you're pushing over all you
want<00:00:49.110> to<00:00:49.170> do<00:00:49.260> is<00:00:49.379> be<00:00:49.410> able<00:00:49.649> to<00:00:49.739> push<00:00:50.100> off<00:00:50.250> one

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
want to do is be able to push off one

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:56.330 
want to do is be able to push off one
card<00:00:50.700> at<00:00:50.789> a<00:00:50.850> time<00:00:51.059> okay<00:00:51.629> um<00:00:55.250> another<00:00:56.250> thing

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
card at a time okay um another thing

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:57.410 
card at a time okay um another thing
that's<00:00:56.760> very<00:00:56.820> important<00:00:57.239> when<00:00:57.360> you're

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
that's very important when you're

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:58.670 
that's very important when you're
dealing<00:00:57.600> is<00:00:57.809> that<00:00:57.899> you<00:00:57.960> don't<00:00:58.079> expose<00:00:58.469> the

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
dealing is that you don't expose the

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.549 
dealing is that you don't expose the
cards<00:00:58.949> um<00:00:59.210> in<00:01:00.210> any<00:01:00.480> way<00:01:00.660> and<00:01:00.930> then<00:01:01.109> flicking

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
cards um in any way and then flicking

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.680 
cards um in any way and then flicking
them<00:01:01.739> down<00:01:01.920> like<00:01:02.129> this<00:01:02.309> can<00:01:02.789> obviously<00:01:02.820> really

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
them down like this can obviously really

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.590 
them down like this can obviously really
expose<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.229> cards<00:01:04.530> to<00:01:04.710> other<00:01:04.830> players<00:01:05.129> um<00:01:05.600> so

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
expose the cards to other players um so

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.539 
expose the cards to other players um so
it's<00:01:06.750> a<00:01:06.840> good<00:01:07.170> practice<00:01:07.409> and<00:01:08.010> what<00:01:08.159> will<00:01:08.430> what

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
it's a good practice and what will what

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.240 
it's a good practice and what will what

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
card all the way across because it could

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.230 
card all the way across because it could

catch puff of air and then flip over all
together<00:01:30.390> and<00:01:30.720> that's<00:01:31.290> not<00:01:31.500> good<00:01:32.009> at<00:01:32.310> all<00:01:32.490> um

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:34.430 
together and that's not good at all um

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:36.679 
together and that's not good at all um
so<00:01:35.430> probably<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:35.939> best<00:01:36.119> way<00:01:36.270> of<00:01:36.299> doing<00:01:36.420> is

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
so probably the best way of doing is

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.330 
so probably the best way of doing is
just<00:01:36.720> to<00:01:37.020> you<00:01:37.290> know<00:01:37.320> go<00:01:37.619> around<00:01:37.890> get<00:01:38.130> as<00:01:38.220> close

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
just to you know go around get as close

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.800 
just to you know go around get as close
as<00:01:38.430> you<00:01:38.579> can<00:01:38.759> to<00:01:38.820> each<00:01:39.000> person<00:01:39.210> and<00:01:39.509> just<00:01:39.570> put

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
as you can to each person and just put

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.840 
as you can to each person and just put
the<00:01:39.900> card<00:01:40.079> down<00:01:40.259> there's<00:01:40.500> no<00:01:40.619> need<00:01:40.799> to<00:01:40.850> flick

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
the card down there's no need to flick

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.539 
the card down there's no need to flick
it<00:01:41.970> down<00:01:42.150> just<00:01:42.689> uh<00:01:42.810> just<00:01:43.170> place<00:01:44.070> the<00:01:44.220> card<00:01:44.430> down

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
it down just uh just place the card down

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.969 
it down just uh just place the card down
in<00:01:44.729> front<00:01:44.850> of<00:01:44.970> the<00:01:45.060> person<00:01:45.420> that's<00:01:45.750> it<00:01:46.680> belongs

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
in front of the person that's it belongs

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.690 
in front of the person that's it belongs
to<00:01:47.189> um<00:01:48.470> so<00:01:49.470> that's<00:01:49.649> the<00:01:49.799> basics<00:01:50.220> of<00:01:50.369> dealing<00:01:50.640> a

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
to um so that's the basics of dealing a

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:58.620 
to um so that's the basics of dealing a
card

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:00.689
