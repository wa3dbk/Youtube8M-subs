 but now for the competition itself 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.800
 because before the award ceremony had the 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.890

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.410

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.120

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.930
 Challenge 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.910
 I have to say after 15 sausages is 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.440
 already reached such a limit that one 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.120
 already play with the thought 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.510

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.579

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:55.289
 the vases tied around with me saying that 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:57.180

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.460
 I can say yes and well 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.260
 it was probably yes I would say that 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:05.100
 the bodily injury was given 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:07.830
 So it was still said he was miserable 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.110
 says I did not say that was 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.729
 a conference I said quiet times 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.770
 So it was not all that bad 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:18.600
 I also did not want something like that 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:20.250
 I'm bad then yes rushes och nei 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.090
 you know now he says nothing again 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.119
 are you crazy 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.200
 Last time I did a beer tasting 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.810
 now only four samples Russian 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.810
 Group of 30 never relieves the handkäs 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:33.119
 sample marankoz mistake make x16 handkäs 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.369
 he wants to meet Beck I always have 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.960
 Just a quick bite and try the 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:41.090
 has eaten all 15 completely now 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.090
 a number should mister again 

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:50.000
 but what does the frankfurter sausage do? 

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:52.020
 now actually frankfurter sausage 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.630
 after all, everyone could come 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.100
 and about his wiener sausages just 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.619
 to designate as frankfurter 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.750
 Nothing says the boss of the flesh guild 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.490
 a frankfurter is and will remain 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:19.980
 frankfurter and thus one 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:23.700
 worth protecting the original 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:25.680
 Assessment criteria look crisp 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.650
 and taste of pork pro 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.959
 sausage in the saibling 49 frankfurter 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:33.090
 Sausages all from good butchers from the 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:34.950
 rhein main area and yet they taste good 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:37.739
 all somehow completely different 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.299
 how come that was actually the 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:43.650
 traditional composition 

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:46.290
 then drew the typical beautiful and yellow 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:49.139
 smoke on the outside on the nature since 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:53.100
 then the crispness of the bite and 

00:02:49.139 --> 00:02:55.829
 of course, the aroma rounded off with salt 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:03:01.560
 with spices and every man his 

00:02:55.829 --> 00:03:03.239
 standard recipe and that's good 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.019
 After all, yes, even the tastes 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:06.780
 different 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:08.910
 but if one knows what's the matter then 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:10.889
 yes, probably the much-cited popular mouth 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:13.200
 so explain to them again now 

00:03:10.889 --> 00:03:15.420
 a real sausage lover from frankfurt 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:19.280
 how it has to be dangerous that 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:19.280
 original frankfurter sausage 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:40.120
 Neat the winner sausage came as 

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:42.250
 surprisingly enough already mentioned 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:45.070
 radio city ​​so from the frankfurter 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:46.750
 But diaspora does not do anything after all 

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:49.090
 went second place to the frankfurter 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:50.950
 Butcher Weibel and about third place 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:53.410
 may the old town butchery schmid 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:56.230
 from mühlheim in the circle offenbach happy 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:58.390
 the celebrity testers were happy 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:00.220
 Finally, also about a successful 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:02.440
 competition for the sausage and above all 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:05.520
 about a little digestive bargain 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:05.520
 after the work is done
