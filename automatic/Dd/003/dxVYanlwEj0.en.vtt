00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:05.520
 Hello everyone by popular demand 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.740
 shooting a second time here is this video 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.800
 I counter on battery working on 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:14.269
 waste oil in the comments you 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:18.090
 I was asked to remove the annealing processor itself 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:18.810
 this furnace than actually now 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:23.340
 let's deal 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:26.699
 and in one of the advice and written by you in 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:29.880
 I liked the comments like this 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:34.230
 practical advice on getting 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:36.090
 the combustion quality of the combustion chamber in 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.090
 the middle of the chamber is more accurate than the fuel 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:42.030
 one person wrote me what you need 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:45.360
 hang a combustion chamber a piece of such 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:48.180
 here is a lump of stainless pods given 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:52.710
 the case I have it ready this kitchen 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:54.829
 scraper he sold such a lump 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:59.730
 let's put the camera in advance now and 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:01:06.479
 let's see how it affects quality 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:09.000
 view work out toy must stress 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:13.710
 in the fact that it is moving faster 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:17.460
 rather than all workers working Akil you here 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:24.270
 Chessy cast iron battery working out 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:28.610
 will start faster than water and thereby i 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:32.070
 I think some kind of stove will rise 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:42.990
 I put the finishing in not the fire 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:48.619
 esco crowns jelly chips well here 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:48.619
 immediately went thrust pod turned red and 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:56.090
 even now I think I can serve 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.090
 working out 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:16.379
 and 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.379
 this 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.220
 Well, here again burned oil 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:44.900
 shavings of hot oil does not drip 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:44.900
 turns into such a burning fuel and 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:53.180
 almost everything works fine at home 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:53.180
 by the way better with this twist better 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:59.720
 problems are taken 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:59.720
 minutes and stoves 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:09.069
 it is generally hot at our very fuel 

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:09.069
 burns Russian better 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:14.780
 dear to the music here is working 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:23.390
 it's pretty become a good idea with 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:23.390
 this twist stickers 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:27.890
 enough 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:31.250
 brighter 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:42.130
 now almost 30 degrees 25 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:42.130
 strained 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:07.000
 can 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:25.740
 I do not know of course how much will be missed and 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:29.210
 that is, the day is rosy so how 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:29.210
 she breaks once 

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:36.660
 Well, how is it okay to fry? 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:51.500
 Thanks for attention 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:56.069
 as noted here drank this video 

00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:02.130
 waiting for your comments about 

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:06.560
 improving and modernizing this 

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:06.560
 designs yet
