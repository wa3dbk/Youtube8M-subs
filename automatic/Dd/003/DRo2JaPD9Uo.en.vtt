now<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:33.600> extension<00:01:34.469> of<00:01:34.590> this<00:01:34.770> is<00:01:35.240> the

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
now the extension of this is the

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.880 
now the extension of this is the
conductor<00:01:36.570> himself<00:01:37.170> has<00:01:37.679> rehearsal<00:01:38.429> has<00:01:38.850> has

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:39.890 
conductor himself has rehearsal has has

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:42.919 
conductor himself has rehearsal has has
sensors<00:01:40.890> attached<00:01:41.159> to<00:01:41.369> each<00:01:41.700> hand<00:01:41.969> to<00:01:42.270> run<00:01:42.479> the

00:01:42.919 --> 00:01:42.929 
sensors attached to each hand to run the

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:45.289 
sensors attached to each hand to run the
lasers<00:01:43.380> now<00:01:43.950> those<00:01:44.130> sensors<00:01:44.670> the<00:01:44.819> information

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
lasers now those sensors the information

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.480 
lasers now those sensors the information
from<00:01:45.420> those<00:01:45.600> sensors<00:01:46.049> can<00:01:46.530> be<00:01:46.560> beamed<00:01:46.979> around

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
from those sensors can be beamed around

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:48.980 
from those sensors can be beamed around
the<00:01:47.789> world<00:01:47.969> wherever<00:01:48.210> there's<00:01:48.509> an<00:01:48.600> internet

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
the world wherever there's an internet

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.190 
the world wherever there's an internet
connection<00:01:49.170> so<00:01:50.159> you<00:01:50.219> can<00:01:50.520> have<00:01:51.200> lasers

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
connection so you can have lasers

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.050 
connection so you can have lasers
conducting<00:01:52.740> orchestras<00:01:53.280> in<00:01:53.549> different

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060

cities of the work absolutely in using

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.539 
cities of the work absolutely in using
so<00:01:57.659> it<00:01:57.810> is<00:01:57.990> it<00:01:58.409> always<00:01:58.649> will<00:01:58.979> be<00:01:59.159> the<00:01:59.189> world's

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
so it is it always will be the world's

so it is it always will be the world's
largest<00:01:59.670> orchestra<00:02:00.299> and<00:02:00.509> the<00:02:01.049> reason<00:02:01.350> for<00:02:01.380> it

00:02:01.669 --> 00:02:01.679 
largest orchestra and the reason for it

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:04.190 
largest orchestra and the reason for it
is<00:02:01.740> to<00:02:01.890> kick<00:02:02.069> off<00:02:02.219> festival<00:02:02.969> of<00:02:03.119> music<00:02:03.840> of
