00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.090
 Hello everyone, guys and welcome 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:04.529
 finally in this brand new video 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.379
 in which we will see how to execute the 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:10.160
 untethered jailbreak of ios 8.4 on mac 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:10.160
 let's start right away 

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:21.930
 then guys start telling you that 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.240
 before performing this jailbreak 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.640
 I strongly advise you to do a 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.259
 Full backup from your fans 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.150
 device in local in case of 

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:31.080
 problems of not losing all the data of the 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.150
 your device 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.320
 after the fact this vico promise that 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:36.000
 before even doing this 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.710
 jailbreak we will have to do some small 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.350
 trick on our device 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:43.350
 the first thing will be to go to the 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:46.260
 settings then go to touch 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.519
 heidi and code and deactivate your own 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.519
 code we insert our code 

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:52.260
 we go down click on disable code 

00:00:50.519 --> 00:00:55.680
 then we will always have to go up 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.430
 iCloud settings and disable finds 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.199
 my iphone 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.970
 I recommend disabled kids finds 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.769
 my iphone because it's very important 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:03.839
 after deactivating find mine 

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:05.489
 iphone we will be asked to enter the 

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:07.320
 passwords of ours and policies for whom 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.790
 did not know and the account you use 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.560
 to download the applications of a 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.549
 once we have done this we will have 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.710
 off find my iphone 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.880
 correctly the third and last thing 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.740
 which we should do on our device 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.290
 will always go about settings 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.990
 then on generals then on the block 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.520
 automatic and therefore never choose in 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.110
 in such a way as to make our own 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.570
 iphone never crashes 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.800
 automatically once you have done 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.510
 all these little things 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:33.240
 we will be ready to perform the jailbreak 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:35.160
 so we should go to our mac 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.020
 open the link that I will leave you in the 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:39.660
 description or the official page of 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.820
 time then download this version of 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:43.140
 tiger where there is the thousand the apple logo in 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.180
 such a way to download the 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.790
 version for mac and once having 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:51.120
 downloaded this application the file yes 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.710
 will demonstrate as a dmg file once 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:55.200
 having downloaded it we will simply have to 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.850
 open it and we will be asked to drag 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.200
 the icon within the applications 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.479
 we will simply have to 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.940
 drag them with inside the desktop 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.290
 and not in applications once you have 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:06.510
 done this we will have to right click 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.340
 icon and then click on open 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:10.050
 to make the applications 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.629
 opened properly as if we were 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.950
 the directors of our mac a 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:16.739
 once we have done this we should 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.870
 obviously connect our iphone to the 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:20.459
 computer and after the program will come 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.890
 we recognized our iphone 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:24.380
 will ask to install two things cydia e 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.930
 freak and jajÃ  system 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:29.090
 boys not installed at all 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.440
 he who is the assistant because he is one 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:31.610
 sort of malware for yours 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.720
 device 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:34.250
 in a nutshell a very simple one 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.900
 application that is installed there e 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.760
 which gives us the opportunity to download ed 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:40.250
 install applications in a pirated way 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.660
 for free and I can't 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.650
 absolutely ensure that it is one 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:45.260
 sure thing 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:47.300
 in fact I tell you to disable this tweak 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.520
 and the assistants that could cause big 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:51.740
 and serious problems to your device 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:53.540
 so once you deactivate it e 

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:54.080
 having obviously kept active the check 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:56.210
 of cydia 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:58.400
 we could click on start you notice that 

00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:00.560
 this video has been speeded up so 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.480
 absolutely the procedure will not be 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:05.630
 short as it will last in this video 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:06.980
 but in fact the only one was speeded up 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:09.440
 what we will have to do will be a non 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.270
 Never disconnect our device from the 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:12.770
 our computer never touch 

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:15.350
 the itunes app from your 

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:17.420
 computer and above all never touch 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:19.220
 your device 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:20.900
 after a few seconds we will notice that the 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:23.240
 our device will restart yes 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:24.890
 it will restart three four maybe five times 

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:25.280
 in short, it will really restart a little 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:27.230
 times 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:29.660
 don't worry because it's all part 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:31.250
 of the jailbreak procedure after the 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:32.720
 your device will restart 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:35.150
 probably the will appear 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.560
 written archive almost full state 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:38.300
 do not worry because it is absolutely not 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:40.040
 true you will not have the full archive of 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:41.780
 you simply need your phone 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:43.490
 click on ends and a very simple one 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:44.030
 banks that occurs when you run 

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:46.070
 the jailbreak 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:47.840
 following some reboots as you can 

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:49.400
 see on the mac the writing will appear 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:52.010
 via the jailbreak app 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:53.900
 succeeded and the next step that 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:55.130
 we should do we will have to do on ours 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:57.020
 device we could easily 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:58.970
 close the time application from ours 

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:00.770
 mac and once having done all this 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:02.510
 we will then have to go to ours 

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:04.580
 device and as you can see in the 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:05.990
 the first free space will appear to us 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:07.390
 cydia application 

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:09.980
 open the application cydia e 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:11.720
 it will automatically make us a small one 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:13.310
 preparation or preparation of the 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:15.410
 file system because they didn't know 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:17.180
 easy loading that lasts a while 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:19.400
 of minutes to me lasted about 5 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:21.350
 minutes once this upload 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:23.660
 Your device will be completed 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:26.030
 it will restart, so rest assured yes 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:27.560
 it will upset your device and one 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:29.060
 once you have done this as you can 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:30.590
 see if we're going to open cydia not 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:33.230
 we will have some 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:34.910
 but give it will work properly later 

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:37.310
 that we will have installed cydia let's go to 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:40.490
 open it and go to the news section 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:42.590
 below in the center of the species 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:43.850
 doc that's inside cydia una 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:45.530
 Once we have gone here we will have to click 

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:47.570
 top left on the writing 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:49.120
 update and wait once 

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:51.410
 precisely this small update 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:53.210
 we will have to click on the top right corner where 

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:54.980
 it says update and in brackets there 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:56.780
 it will be a small number so we click 

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:58.790
 on confirmation and we await the update 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:00.500
 at this point we will have executed 

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:02.300
 correctly the jailbreak of ours 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:04.070
 iphone we can install any 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:07.370
