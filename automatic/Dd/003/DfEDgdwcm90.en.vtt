is<00:00:36.960> right<00:00:37.559> up<00:00:37.710> there<00:00:37.920> in<00:00:38.070> fact<00:00:38.309> you<00:00:38.460> can<00:00:38.610> see

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
is right up there in fact you can see

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.660 
is right up there in fact you can see
this<00:00:38.879> is<00:00:39.030> roughly<00:00:39.329> the<00:00:39.600> same<00:00:40.140> size<00:00:40.199> as<00:00:40.769> a<00:00:40.800> Sega

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
this is roughly the same size as a Sega

this is roughly the same size as a Sega
Saturn<00:00:42.000> controller<00:00:42.659> which<00:00:42.870> is<00:00:42.900> roughly<00:00:43.260> the

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:43.409 
Saturn controller which is roughly the

very very unique controller joystick

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.210 
very very unique controller joystick
thing<00:00:56.070> here<00:00:56.600> it's<00:00:57.600> like<00:00:57.689> a<00:00:57.750> combination<00:00:58.290> d-pad

00:00:59.210 --> 00:00:59.220 
thing here it's like a combination d-pad

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:02.749 
thing here it's like a combination d-pad
and<00:00:59.250> analog<00:01:00.089> stick<00:01:00.510> really<00:01:01.439> cool<00:01:01.799> I<00:01:02.070> also<00:01:02.460> like

00:01:02.749 --> 00:01:02.759 
and analog stick really cool I also like

00:01:02.759 --> 00:01:05.090 
and analog stick really cool I also like
the<00:01:02.909> nice<00:01:03.059> textured<00:01:03.689> finish<00:01:04.049> the<00:01:04.589> fact<00:01:04.920> that

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
the nice textured finish the fact that

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.609 
the nice textured finish the fact that
it<00:01:05.220> says<00:01:05.400> SNK<00:01:06.119> Neo<00:01:06.450> Geo<00:01:06.840> right<00:01:07.200> on<00:01:07.290> the<00:01:07.409> front

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
it says SNK Neo Geo right on the front

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.980 
it says SNK Neo Geo right on the front
of<00:01:07.740> it<00:01:07.860> is<00:01:07.979> cool<00:01:08.280> because<00:01:09.000> this<00:01:09.330> is<00:01:09.450> a<00:01:09.479> fairly

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
of it is cool because this is a fairly

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.620 
of it is cool because this is a fairly
rare<00:01:10.380> video<00:01:11.130> game<00:01:11.430> console<00:01:12.000> and<00:01:12.150> a<00:01:12.270> fairly

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
rare video game console and a fairly

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.780 
rare video game console and a fairly
rare<00:01:12.960> controller<00:01:13.500> not<00:01:13.770> nearly<00:01:14.009> as<00:01:14.220> common<00:01:14.670> as

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
rare controller not nearly as common as

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.780 
rare controller not nearly as common as
the<00:01:15.299> Genesis<00:01:15.780> or<00:01:16.020> Saturn<00:01:16.560> upon<00:01:17.490> closer

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
the Genesis or Saturn upon closer

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.819 
the Genesis or Saturn upon closer
inspection<00:01:18.090> you<00:01:18.540> can<00:01:18.689> see<00:01:18.990> that<00:01:19.170> it<00:01:19.320> has<00:01:19.350> four

00:01:19.819 --> 00:01:19.829 
inspection you can see that it has four

00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:21.920 
inspection you can see that it has four
buttons<00:01:20.189> that<00:01:20.369> say<00:01:20.549> ABC<00:01:21.330> indeed<00:01:21.659> different

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
buttons that say ABC indeed different

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.190 
buttons that say ABC indeed different
colors<00:01:22.940> select<00:01:23.940> button<00:01:24.300> start<00:01:24.780> button<00:01:25.110> these

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
colors select button start button these

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.350 
colors select button start button these
are<00:01:25.350> both<00:01:25.500> rubber<00:01:25.800> and<00:01:26.100> here's<00:01:26.700> that<00:01:26.940> really

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
are both rubber and here's that really

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.180 
are both rubber and here's that really
cool<00:01:27.870> joystick<00:01:30.500> it<00:01:31.500> makes<00:01:31.680> a<00:01:31.770> clicking<00:01:32.159> sound

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:32.190 
cool joystick it makes a clicking sound

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:35.320 
cool joystick it makes a clicking sound
every<00:01:32.670> time<00:01:32.700> you<00:01:33.030> push<00:01:33.240> it<00:01:33.450> all<00:01:34.229> the<00:01:34.290> way<00:01:34.500> over

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:35.330 
every time you push it all the way over

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:37.910 
every time you push it all the way over
so<00:01:36.330> you<00:01:36.420> can<00:01:36.510> do<00:01:36.659> that<00:01:36.840> too<00:01:37.050> it<00:01:37.200> has<00:01:37.710> a<00:01:37.740> little

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
so you can do that too it has a little

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.740 
so you can do that too it has a little
nub<00:01:38.190> there<00:01:38.400> on<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.550> top<00:01:38.790> letting<00:01:39.120> you<00:01:39.210> letting

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
nub there on the top letting you letting

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.330 
nub there on the top letting you letting
your<00:01:39.810> thumb<00:01:40.170> know<00:01:40.350> where<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:40.860> top<00:01:41.070> actually

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
your thumb know where the top actually

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.540 
your thumb know where the top actually
is<00:01:41.880> it<00:01:42.150> seems<00:01:42.360> unnecessary<00:01:43.050> but<00:01:43.550> actually

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:44.550 
is it seems unnecessary but actually

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:46.610 
is it seems unnecessary but actually
it's<00:01:44.760> kind<00:01:45.030> of<00:01:45.090> nice<00:01:45.210> to<00:01:45.270> have<00:01:45.659> if<00:01:46.350> you<00:01:46.470> look

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:46.620 
it's kind of nice to have if you look

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:49.010 
it's kind of nice to have if you look
underneath<00:01:47.060> very<00:01:48.060> simple<00:01:48.510> looks<00:01:48.659> a<00:01:48.720> lot<00:01:48.870> like

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
underneath very simple looks a lot like

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.230 
underneath very simple looks a lot like
the<00:01:49.200> Genesis<00:01:49.620> controller<00:01:49.799> just<00:01:50.340> says<00:01:50.520> SNK

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
the Genesis controller just says SNK

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.260 
the Genesis controller just says SNK
down<00:01:51.479> there<00:01:51.780> and<00:01:52.530> this<00:01:53.010> is<00:01:53.159> a<00:01:53.190> much<00:01:53.880> smaller

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
down there and this is a much smaller

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.550 
down there and this is a much smaller
version<00:01:54.900> of<00:01:55.260> the<00:01:56.130> original<00:01:56.540> gigantic<00:01:57.540> Neo<00:01:58.170> Geo

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
controller a huge joystick that they

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.670 
controller a huge joystick that they
sold<00:02:01.229> with<00:02:01.470> the<00:02:01.650> SNK<00:02:02.340> Neo<00:02:02.610> Geo<00:02:03.000> AES<00:02:03.409> the<00:02:04.409> Neo

Geo CD was a cost-cutting measure from

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.009 
Geo CD was a cost-cutting measure from
SNK<00:02:08.250> but<00:02:08.759> they<00:02:08.909> still<00:02:09.179> managed<00:02:09.509> to<00:02:09.690> put<00:02:09.899> out

SNK but they still managed to put out
one<00:02:10.229> of<00:02:10.259> the<00:02:10.500> greatest<00:02:11.009> game<00:02:11.280> controllers
