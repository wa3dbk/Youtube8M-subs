00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 hello to all and hello to all 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.490
 the enemies his flights but we end up 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.500
 this week for the discovery of a 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:11.370
 new snapshot prepared with love by 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:14.340
 mojang version 1.7 in approach this is 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.289
 the 13w 39a is big today 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.289
 novelty here we are finally in a bio 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:21.090
 but that's yeah you high class I'm 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.609
 very happy so good I did not 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.960
 broke the behind I did not break 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.660
 the dr chon is sure to find this 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.050
 biome i searched on google of 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.270
 coordinates finally coordinates 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:34.739
 incident made to be able 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:35.850
 this pony directly in and that's 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.500
 really cool 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.390
 I take this opportunity because it is 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.160
 really a bios but I think it's great 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.520
 desert symbiosis to send trees 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.989
 dead but frankly that's all 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.550
 warm colors as I like and 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.620
 it's a real kif and moreover it's us 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.000
 allows to link directly to the 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.370
 first novelty of this tablecloth shot 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.899
 it's the appearance of the sand raid sand 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.500
 red which is so a new block 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:00.239
 available in minecraft now this 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.960
 block appears only in the 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:06.390
 bio but that we can have deserts of 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.729
 two ash raids actually but that's 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.490
 especially deserts that belong to the 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.110
 bio but that's it, I'm putting myself in f3 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.409
 will always be but that and it will be nothing 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.580
 else 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:20.100
 So here are deserts with sand 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.720
 orange it's always fun sand 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.250
 orange precisely fine red sand 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.890
 if I literally translate the raid 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.869
 sands has the same properties as the 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.200
 normal sand to know you can the 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:32.460
 turn into glass by cooking it 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.140
 but you can also 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:38.040
 serve for kraft and TNT 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.960
 by cons and this is where it changes there 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.430
 the difference is actually that you do not 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.840
 can not use it to make 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.840
 the sanch red zone 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.520
 maybe that will be improved by 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.840
 the result maybe that precisely the 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.670
 red sand we will really have 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.470
 completely the same properties but 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.540
 good for now this is not the case 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.740
 for the rest it's done now 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.619
 we will be interested in the novelty 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:01.310
 main of this slick shot the one that 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:03.810
 everyone is waiting for me to describe 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.659
 even if it's not it's not really my 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.030
 cup of tea one but these are 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:09.709
 minecraft commend block or rather late the 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:12.860
 same cards with like a block to 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:14.450
 the big novelty interior that's going 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:16.489
 still rejoice the map maker me I say 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:18.260
 that thanks to that the map maker they go 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:21.040
 give it to your heart's content we'll have the 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:23.690
 right of real games in the game 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.069
 to take a deeper interest 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:27.799
 I propose to guide us 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:28.580
 mediately a come and the block in 

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:30.500
 a mike hart 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:33.560
 for that it is enough simply to 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:37.879
 type the slash command give your 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:40.610
 name the volkswagen instance for me up 

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:45.650
 minecraft two points you clear the 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:47.810
 flange and so you have pompom the 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:52.250
 hopper underscore command come and 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:53.629
 block scores and inserting this 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:55.819
 command you can live you 

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:59.030
 immediately one card with a come 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:03:01.129
 and block sailing or so how 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:02.720
 works it's very simple there is a thousand 

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:04.430
 and possible use 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:07.519
 I have none for really 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:09.019
 take full advantage of this block the one that 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:12.109
 I saw while documenting myself a little 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:14.000
 everywhere but the main thing is going to be 

00:03:12.109 --> 00:03:16.160
 really to be able to use the 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.410
 week slash command that will allow 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.880
 to make objects appear 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:21.109
 or to bring up monsters - in 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:22.160
 the occurrence I'm going to show up 

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:23.810
 creepers on the small platform 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:25.849
 which is above the water see 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:28.010
 just here just simply 

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:29.510
 take the coordinates of this plate 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:31.099
 form so I took the coordinates of the 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:34.609
 within coordinates by name of the center 

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:36.919
 of the platform and we're actually going 

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:40.250
 enter this command so if you know 

00:03:36.919 --> 00:03:45.680
 week the entity is in this case what 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:47.209
 will be creepers for me then we enter 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:52.280
 the xyz coordinates 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:54.799
 so me it will be less 44 66 minus-6 and 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:58.489
 tags so I'm not here 

00:03:54.799 --> 00:03:59.870
 give so here we are normally 

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:02.120
 it's all going well if I have nothing 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:03.319
 no meatball or in 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:07.230
 hard so I'll be able to make this pot 

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:09.150
 neither the creepers are we just pushed 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:12.200
 here and you can see them 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:12.200
 creepers start to appear 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:16.739
 here is stern stern 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:19.620
 here are invocations and boom so here we 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:21.479
 has a galaxy of creeper then of course 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:23.669
 the common block does not activate in 

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:27.090
 going on the rails booster activate 

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:29.460
 simply going on the rails 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:32.120
 activation activate the Chinese so 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:35.430
 when powered by redstone 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:37.560
 here you can only turn off 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:41.400
 when the same block camp is powered 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:45.150
 in redstone of course so here we are 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:47.760
 you have the ear the end how to say 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:49.590
 the mast a map that follows his little 

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:51.389
 merry way and every time he 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:54.120
 there are creepers a multitude of creeper 

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:57.510
 which is invoked so we will avoid 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:58.830
 make good game bugger here we go 

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:00.150
 stop that but you can see it so 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:02.580
 it's pretty cool to be able to do 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:05.460
 to appear monsters as and when 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:08.010
 measurement with a delay system yesterday from 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:10.229
 two I do not know what a little redstone 

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:12.620
 complicated I think the bookies 

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:14.729
 have to give their heart kind here 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:16.080
 goal it's pushed back the mind maps 

00:05:14.729 --> 00:05:18.060
 and then you're going to have to go into a 

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:20.430
 tunnel and every time the mind map 

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:21.690
 will summon a monster for you 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:23.070
 can be a relatively useful 

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:24.500
 friendly so we will not spit 

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:26.910
 above 

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:28.530
 go we find ourselves in a new 

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:30.570
 bios now to talk about the whole 

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:32.400
 last novelty of this snapshot 

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:34.200
 because there is none and no 

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:36.300
 many unfortunately this week 

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:38.250
 well we saw the two main ones 

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:40.289
 little novelty that unfortunately does not 

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:43.700
 I do not like it at all it's the appearance 

00:05:40.289 --> 00:05:47.620
 or rather the reappearance we will say d 

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:50.710
 cobol and gravel 

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:54.610
 desert village it's ugly how 

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:57.310
 tell you it's not going at all with how 

00:05:54.610 --> 00:06:00.460
 say with the decor itself what and 

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:01.380
 the forges recover their flagstones 

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:04.570
 sandton 

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:06.370
 here is sandton stone lily pardon 

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:08.460
 but precisely if it could maze 

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:11.560
 sandston it would have been downright better 

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:15.280
 but here, in this case, it's not 

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:16.570
 all this and there unfortunately it's 

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:18.639
 ugly what graphically it's ugly 

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:19.930
 so I hope they will change that from 

00:06:18.639 --> 00:06:20.620
 again because I find that I see 

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:23.139
 not so much interest 

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:25.900
 but here is the desert village 

00:06:23.139 --> 00:06:27.880
 are a little shabby good too bad 

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:29.710
 are things that happen but in 

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:32.289
 anyway it allows us to conclude 

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:33.820
 this snapshot presentation video 

00:06:32.289 --> 00:06:35.229
 if I hope you will be pleased we will 

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:37.210
 found next week for one 

00:06:35.229 --> 00:06:40.300
 last snapshot I think before the 

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:41.800
 out of the 1.7 we should have when 

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:44.860
 even a few weeks before the release 

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:46.620
 definitive we will have I still think 

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:48.639
 some small news 

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:50.889
 I hope there will be other blocks 

00:06:48.639 --> 00:06:52.570
 because I'm I'm hungry for 

00:06:50.889 --> 00:06:53.889
 blocks 1 I want new block there in 

00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:55.810
 a resistant so it's cool 

00:06:53.889 --> 00:06:57.039
 at least one new block one finds oneself 

00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:59.139
 next week times to check 

00:06:57.039 --> 00:07:01.560
 all this will take good care of you 

00:06:59.139 --> 00:07:01.560
 cat friends
