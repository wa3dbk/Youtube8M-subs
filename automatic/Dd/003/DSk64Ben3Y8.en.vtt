bookshelf<00:00:40.290> and<00:00:40.500> they<00:00:40.680> have<00:00:40.800> no<00:00:40.980> idea<00:00:41.340> until<00:00:41.489> I

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
bookshelf and they have no idea until I

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.060 
bookshelf and they have no idea until I
open<00:00:42.000> it<00:00:42.120> um<00:00:42.329> but<00:00:43.110> it<00:00:43.200> wasn't<00:00:43.530> enough<00:00:43.770> just<00:00:43.800> to

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
open it um but it wasn't enough just to

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.410 
open it um but it wasn't enough just to
put<00:00:44.129> a<00:00:44.280> bookshelf<00:00:44.730> there<00:00:44.940> and<00:00:45.090> put<00:00:45.239> it<00:00:45.329> on

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
put a bookshelf there and put it on

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.090 
put a bookshelf there and put it on
hinges<00:00:45.840> to<00:00:45.989> open<00:00:46.320> it<00:00:46.440> wasn't<00:00:46.739> you<00:00:46.829> know<00:00:46.920> wasn't

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
hinges to open it wasn't you know wasn't

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.130 
hinges to open it wasn't you know wasn't
cool<00:00:47.340> enough<00:00:47.550> wasn't<00:00:47.850> discreet<00:00:48.329> enough<00:00:48.570> so<00:00:49.110> I

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
cool enough wasn't discreet enough so I

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.869 
cool enough wasn't discreet enough so I
always<00:00:49.469> used<00:00:49.739> to<00:00:49.800> see<00:00:50.010> in<00:00:50.100> movies<00:00:50.280> where<00:00:50.730> you

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
always used to see in movies where you

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.790 
always used to see in movies where you
pull<00:00:51.120> one<00:00:51.360> book<00:00:51.660> at<00:00:51.870> a<00:00:51.930> right<00:00:52.140> angle<00:00:52.620> and<00:00:52.649> the

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
pull one book at a right angle and the

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.799 
pull one book at a right angle and the
whole<00:00:52.980> wall<00:00:53.219> opens<00:00:53.670> up<00:00:53.850> to<00:00:54.090> secret<00:00:54.480> like<00:00:54.660> you

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
whole wall opens up to secret like you

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.350 
whole wall opens up to secret like you
know<00:00:54.930> dungeon<00:00:55.440> or<00:00:55.559> something<00:00:55.890> cool<00:00:56.010> like<00:00:56.070> that

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:56.360 
know dungeon or something cool like that

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.880 
know dungeon or something cool like that
so<00:00:57.360> I<00:00:57.390> don't<00:00:57.510> have<00:00:57.750> anything<00:00:57.930> that<00:00:58.320> elaborate

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
so I don't have anything that elaborate

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.470 
so I don't have anything that elaborate
but<00:00:59.010> I<00:00:59.039> decided<00:00:59.370> that<00:00:59.579> I<00:00:59.699> could<00:00:59.969> hook<00:01:00.120> up<00:01:00.329> a

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
but I decided that I could hook up a

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.869 
but I decided that I could hook up a
book<00:01:00.719> and<00:01:00.899> make<00:01:01.770> it<00:01:01.800> spring-loaded<00:01:02.489> so<00:01:02.699> when<00:01:02.820> I

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
book and make it spring-loaded so when I

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.390 
book and make it spring-loaded so when I
pull<00:01:03.090> the<00:01:03.210> book<00:01:03.420> off<00:01:03.629> the<00:01:03.660> shelf<00:01:04.110> the<00:01:05.010> latch<00:01:05.189> on

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
pull the book off the shelf the latch on

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.429 
pull the book off the shelf the latch on
the<00:01:05.430> inside<00:01:05.880> will<00:01:06.210> open<00:01:06.600> up<00:01:06.720> in<00:01:06.869> an<00:01:06.960> unlock

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
the inside will open up in an unlock

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.170 
the inside will open up in an unlock
thing<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:08.189> book<00:01:08.400> will<00:01:08.580> slide<00:01:08.760> back<00:01:08.939> into

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
thing the book will slide back into

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.450 
thing the book will slide back into
place<00:01:09.450> and<00:01:09.479> then<00:01:09.780> I<00:01:09.840> can<00:01:10.080> open<00:01:10.470> the<00:01:10.590> door<00:01:10.619> so<00:01:11.310> if

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
place and then I can open the door so if

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:12.770 
place and then I can open the door so if
someone<00:01:11.790> realize<00:01:12.090> there's<00:01:12.270> a<00:01:12.330> room<00:01:12.600> back

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
someone realize there's a room back

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.149 
someone realize there's a room back
there<00:01:12.840> and<00:01:13.290> they<00:01:13.380> tried<00:01:13.590> pulling<00:01:13.619> on<00:01:14.040> the

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
there and they tried pulling on the

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:15.800 
there and they tried pulling on the
bookshelf<00:01:14.580> it<00:01:14.729> wouldn't<00:01:15.030> open<00:01:15.210> unless<00:01:15.570> you

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
bookshelf it wouldn't open unless you

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.230 
bookshelf it wouldn't open unless you
knew<00:01:15.960> which<00:01:16.140> book<00:01:16.439> to<00:01:16.619> pull<00:01:16.830> to<00:01:16.979> unlock<00:01:17.430> it<00:01:17.729> so

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
knew which book to pull to unlock it so

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.760 
knew which book to pull to unlock it so
let<00:01:18.390> me<00:01:18.479> demonstrate<00:01:18.630> that<00:01:18.990> for<00:01:19.140> you<00:01:19.350> guys<00:01:19.380> and

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.740 
then I'll actually show you the book and
how<00:01:21.360> that<00:01:21.540> works<00:01:21.750> so<00:01:22.640> basically<00:01:23.640> from<00:01:23.790> here<00:01:24.090> it

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
how that works so basically from here it

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.420 
how that works so basically from here it

that if I let go it actually will slide

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.149 
that if I let go it actually will slide
back<00:01:50.909> into<00:01:51.240> place<00:01:51.450> by<00:01:51.689> itself<00:01:52.110> and<00:01:52.470> it<00:01:53.100> will

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
back into place by itself and it will

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.580 
back into place by itself and it will
relax<00:01:53.610> itself<00:01:54.090> right<00:01:54.689> into<00:01:54.930> position<00:01:55.049> boom

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
relax itself right into position boom

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.679 
relax itself right into position boom
there<00:01:55.860> you<00:01:55.890> go<00:01:56.100> so<00:01:56.399> that's<00:01:57.270> how<00:01:57.450> that<00:01:57.509> works

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
there you go so that's how that works

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.719 
there you go so that's how that works
let<00:01:58.200> me<00:01:58.229> show<00:01:58.409> you<00:01:58.469> close-up<00:01:59.070> on<00:01:59.189> that<00:01:59.250> so

let me show you close-up on that so

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.429 
let me show you close-up on that so

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
can see this one I literally grab it I

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.020 
can see this one I literally grab it I
pull<00:02:07.350> it<00:02:07.500> out<00:02:07.649> you<00:02:07.890> can<00:02:08.039> hear<00:02:08.220> it<00:02:08.310> unlock<00:02:08.610> and

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
it slides itself back into place so

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:11.930 
it slides itself back into place so
that's<00:02:10.950> how<00:02:11.280> that<00:02:11.340> works

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
that's how that works

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.760
