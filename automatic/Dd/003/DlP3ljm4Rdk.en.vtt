take a quick picture of something inside

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.940 
take a quick picture of something inside
my<00:01:05.700> flatbed<00:01:05.970> scanner<00:01:06.540> and<00:01:06.960> I<00:01:07.049> take<00:01:07.290> my<00:01:07.439> object

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
my flatbed scanner and I take my object

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.410 
my flatbed scanner and I take my object
and<00:01:08.070> I<00:01:08.130> can<00:01:08.159> try<00:01:08.640> and<00:01:08.760> close<00:01:08.909> the<00:01:09.090> lid<00:01:09.270> and

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
and I can try and close the lid and

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.500 
and I can try and close the lid and
never<00:01:09.990> looks<00:01:10.290> right<00:01:10.409> this<00:01:11.100> one<00:01:11.340> here<00:01:11.729> this<00:01:12.330> is

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
never looks right this one here this is

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.330 
never looks right this one here this is
this<00:01:12.659> eliminates<00:01:13.260> a<00:01:13.380> whole<00:01:13.590> need<00:01:13.860> of<00:01:14.010> having

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
this eliminates a whole need of having

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.520 
this eliminates a whole need of having
to<00:01:14.430> have<00:01:14.580> a<00:01:14.610> little<00:01:15.030> light<00:01:15.479> source<00:01:15.780> box<00:01:16.140> and<00:01:16.500> a

camera on a tripod you just pump it
inside<00:01:19.140> here<00:01:19.560> and<00:01:19.710> out<00:01:20.280> it<00:01:20.430> pops<00:01:22.009> eventually

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:23.720 
inside here and out it pops eventually

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.560 
inside here and out it pops eventually

place here to a clear dance but the
whole<00:01:58.890> idea<00:01:59.310> is<00:01:59.400> let's<00:01:59.640> say<00:01:59.760> you've<00:02:00.450> got<00:02:00.479> stuff

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:00.900 
whole idea is let's say you've got stuff

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:03.020 
whole idea is let's say you've got stuff
for<00:02:01.140> for<00:02:01.560> eBay<00:02:01.830> auctions<00:02:02.280> so<00:02:02.460> you<00:02:02.580> go<00:02:02.700> ahead

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
for for eBay auctions so you go ahead
