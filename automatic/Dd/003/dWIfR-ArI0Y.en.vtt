I think he went that one it was the
wrong<00:02:53.660> 47<00:02:54.380> I<00:02:54.560> remember<00:02:55.540> specifically<00:02:56.540> when<00:02:56.810> he

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
wrong 47 I remember specifically when he

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.979

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:03.310 
got to about forty seven percent I
started<00:03:00.860> to<00:03:00.920> feel<00:03:00.950> a<00:03:01.130> bit<00:03:01.280> strange<00:03:01.430> I<00:03:02.320> can't

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:03.320 
started to feel a bit strange I can't

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:04.690 
started to feel a bit strange I can't
remember<00:03:03.560> how<00:03:03.709> many<00:03:03.739> cups<00:03:04.070> of<00:03:04.190> tea<00:03:04.370> I<00:03:04.400> had

by the third cup they were already

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:13.220 
by the third cup they were already

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
getting out of hand before they know it

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.470 
getting out of hand before they know it
our<00:03:21.390> boys<00:03:21.600> were<00:03:21.810> in<00:03:21.959> way<00:03:22.200> over<00:03:22.230> their<00:03:22.500> heads<00:03:22.950> in

they<00:03:38.660> just<00:03:38.690> jump<00:03:38.989> up<00:03:39.140> again<00:03:43.390> maybe<00:03:44.739> just<00:03:45.739> maybe

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.010 
they just jump up again maybe just maybe

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:48.460

you<00:03:46.970> will<00:03:47.120> get<00:03:47.300> to<00:03:47.450> the<00:03:47.569> halfway<00:03:47.720> point<00:03:47.930> and<00:03:48.350> it

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:48.470 
you will get to the halfway point and it

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:50.020 
you will get to the halfway point and it
will<00:03:48.590> jump<00:03:48.770> forward<00:03:49.220> so<00:03:49.580> we<00:03:49.610> saw<00:03:49.819> we<00:03:49.910> have
