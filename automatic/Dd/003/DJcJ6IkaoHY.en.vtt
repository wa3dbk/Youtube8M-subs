00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:48.380 

and<00:04:45.140> most<00:04:46.140> beetles<00:04:46.740> do<00:04:46.980> not<00:04:47.190> drag<00:04:47.700> their<00:04:48.150> legs

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:48.390 
and most beetles do not drag their legs

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:52.610 
and most beetles do not drag their legs
way<00:04:48.840> back<00:04:49.380> here<00:04:49.800> they're<00:04:50.760> usually<00:04:51.150> up<00:04:51.810> in<00:04:52.110> this

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:52.620

area when you see them walking beetles

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:01.310 
area when you see them walking beetles
are<00:04:59.700> fun<00:04:59.970> you<00:05:00.000> can<00:05:00.360> put<00:05:00.390> them<00:05:00.690> in<00:05:00.780> practically

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:01.320 
are fun you can put them in practically

any position and now we're going to try

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:09.950 
any position and now we're going to try
to<00:05:08.280> achieve<00:05:08.730> the<00:05:08.970> same<00:05:09.270> thing<00:05:09.660> on<00:05:09.810> the<00:05:09.930> other

anywhere<00:05:56.289> we<00:05:56.619> want<00:06:00.959> using<00:06:01.959> pins

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:13.140 

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:16.100 

and<00:06:13.580> beetles<00:06:14.580> are<00:06:15.120> going<00:06:15.420> to<00:06:15.510> take<00:06:15.720> a<00:06:15.750> couple

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:16.110 
and beetles are going to take a couple

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:20.060 
and beetles are going to take a couple
days<00:06:16.350> to<00:06:16.890> dry<00:06:17.280> and<00:06:18.680> then<00:06:19.680> we're<00:06:19.890> going<00:06:20.040> to

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:20.070 
days to dry and then we're going to

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:25.730 
days to dry and then we're going to
remove<00:06:20.460> all<00:06:20.670> the<00:06:21.150> pins<00:06:21.600> very<00:06:22.110> carefully<00:06:24.740> and

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:25.740 
remove all the pins very carefully and

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:28.280 
remove all the pins very carefully and
remember<00:06:26.340> if<00:06:26.490> you<00:06:26.670> do<00:06:26.850> break<00:06:27.120> any<00:06:27.480> pieces<00:06:28.110> and

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:28.290 
remember if you do break any pieces and

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:35.260 
remember if you do break any pieces and
parts<00:06:28.470> you<00:06:28.650> can<00:06:29.040> you<00:06:29.670> can<00:06:29.910> glue<00:06:30.120> them<00:06:30.300> back<00:06:30.510> on

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:35.270 

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:39.650 

and<00:06:36.270> I<00:06:36.450> think<00:06:36.510> he<00:06:36.900> looks<00:06:37.110> rather<00:06:37.380> well
