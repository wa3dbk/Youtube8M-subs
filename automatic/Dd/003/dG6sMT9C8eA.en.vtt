00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.530 

so<00:00:00.390> I<00:00:00.420> wanted<00:00:00.900> to<00:00:00.989> show<00:00:01.170> a<00:00:01.439> how<00:00:01.829> to<00:00:01.890> and<00:00:02.669> I

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:03.540 
so I wanted to show a how to and I

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:05.570 
so I wanted to show a how to and I
certainly<00:00:04.049> can't<00:00:04.380> take<00:00:04.620> credit<00:00:05.040> for<00:00:05.220> it<00:00:05.279> but<00:00:05.520> I

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:05.580 
certainly can't take credit for it but I

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.940 
certainly can't take credit for it but I
learned<00:00:05.940> it<00:00:06.120> in<00:00:06.299> a<00:00:06.690> botanical<00:00:07.410> demonstration

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
learned it in a botanical demonstration

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.339 
learned it in a botanical demonstration
class<00:00:08.160> and<00:00:08.490> it's<00:00:09.090> coming<00:00:09.389> really<00:00:09.570> handy<00:00:10.139> with

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
class and it's coming really handy with

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:12.680 
class and it's coming really handy with
any<00:00:10.740> of<00:00:10.950> the<00:00:11.040> watercolor<00:00:11.309> work<00:00:11.639> that<00:00:11.820> I<00:00:11.849> do<00:00:11.969> so

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
any of the watercolor work that I do so

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.530 
any of the watercolor work that I do so
um<00:00:13.049> it's<00:00:13.590> related<00:00:14.219> to<00:00:14.250> using<00:00:14.790> drawing<00:00:15.059> gum<00:00:15.269> or

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
um it's related to using drawing gum or

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.099 
um it's related to using drawing gum or
Frost<00:00:15.870> it<00:00:16.109> frisket<00:00:16.590> and<00:00:16.859> I<00:00:17.850> used<00:00:18.600> to<00:00:18.720> just<00:00:18.900> use

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
Frost it frisket and I used to just use

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.460 
Frost it frisket and I used to just use
a<00:00:19.439> brush<00:00:20.400> that<00:00:20.850> was<00:00:21.029> all<00:00:21.390> beat<00:00:21.689> up<00:00:21.840> and<00:00:22.080> gross

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
a brush that was all beat up and gross

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.250 
a brush that was all beat up and gross
for<00:00:22.769> my<00:00:23.460> frisket<00:00:23.850> you<00:00:23.970> work<00:00:24.660> which<00:00:24.869> is<00:00:25.019> why<00:00:25.230> I

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
for my frisket you work which is why I

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.920 
for my frisket you work which is why I
marked<00:00:25.680> it<00:00:25.769> like<00:00:25.980> this<00:00:26.130> but<00:00:27.119> I<00:00:27.150> found<00:00:27.449> it<00:00:27.689> was

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
marked it like this but I found it was

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.439 
marked it like this but I found it was
not<00:00:28.380> very<00:00:28.650> precise<00:00:29.099> and<00:00:29.400> it<00:00:29.760> would<00:00:29.880> get<00:00:30.060> really

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
not very precise and it would get really

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.150 
not very precise and it would get really
really<00:00:30.810> messy<00:00:31.410> in<00:00:31.500> the<00:00:31.619> brush<00:00:31.769> and<00:00:32.009> I<00:00:32.040> was

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
really messy in the brush and I was

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.639 
really messy in the brush and I was
constantly<00:00:32.520> having<00:00:32.820> to<00:00:33.000> wash<00:00:33.210> it<00:00:33.420> so<00:00:34.020> luckily

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
constantly having to wash it so luckily

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.590 
constantly having to wash it so luckily
what<00:00:35.070> this<00:00:35.340> botanical<00:00:36.000> illustration

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
what this botanical illustration

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.690 
what this botanical illustration
instructor<00:00:37.290> introduced<00:00:37.710> to<00:00:37.860> me<00:00:37.980> was<00:00:38.520> the<00:00:38.670> idea

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
instructor introduced to me was the idea

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.000 
instructor introduced to me was the idea
of<00:00:39.000> using<00:00:39.180> what's<00:00:39.719> called<00:00:39.780> a<00:00:40.079> ruling<00:00:40.469> pin<00:00:40.739> and

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
of using what's called a ruling pin and

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.569 
of using what's called a ruling pin and
so<00:00:41.820> it's<00:00:42.239> a<00:00:42.510> simple<00:00:43.020> drafting<00:00:43.829> and<00:00:44.070> possibly

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
so it's a simple drafting and possibly

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.490 
so it's a simple drafting and possibly
mathematical<00:00:45.390> tool<00:00:45.539> I'm<00:00:45.750> not<00:00:45.960> entirely<00:00:46.289> sure

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
mathematical tool I'm not entirely sure

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.920 
mathematical tool I'm not entirely sure
I<00:00:46.800> only<00:00:47.160> use<00:00:47.370> it<00:00:47.399> for<00:00:47.550> the<00:00:47.700> brisket<00:00:47.910> but<00:00:48.629> anyway

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
I only use it for the brisket but anyway

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.869 
I only use it for the brisket but anyway
it's<00:00:49.110> got<00:00:49.260> two<00:00:49.559> little<00:00:49.770> pinchy<00:00:50.280> parts<00:00:50.579> here

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
it's got two little pinchy parts here

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.639 
it's got two little pinchy parts here
that<00:00:51.329> come<00:00:51.510> together<00:00:51.660> and<00:00:52.020> you<00:00:52.079> can<00:00:52.230> turn<00:00:52.469> the

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
that come together and you can turn the

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.369 
that come together and you can turn the
wheel<00:00:52.770> to<00:00:53.039> narrow<00:00:53.340> or<00:00:53.640> widen<00:00:54.360> how<00:00:54.809> far<00:00:55.050> open

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
wheel to narrow or widen how far open

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.709 
wheel to narrow or widen how far open
there<00:00:55.590> and<00:00:55.860> that<00:00:56.430> will<00:00:56.579> actually<00:00:57.120> dictate<00:00:57.539> how

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
there and that will actually dictate how

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.900 
there and that will actually dictate how
narrow<00:00:58.020> or<00:00:58.289> wide<00:00:58.379> a<00:00:58.680> line<00:00:59.129> you<00:00:59.340> can<00:00:59.370> make<00:00:59.699> with

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
narrow or wide a line you can make with

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.709 
narrow or wide a line you can make with
the<00:01:00.030> first<00:01:00.270> game<00:01:00.739> so<00:01:01.739> when<00:01:02.250> I<00:01:02.280> use<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.329> frisket

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
the first game so when I use the frisket

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.310 
the first game so when I use the frisket
it's<00:01:03.899> always<00:01:04.290> super<00:01:04.650> gross<00:01:04.890> inside<00:01:05.369> and<00:01:06.320> kind

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
it's always super gross inside and kind

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.740 
it's always super gross inside and kind
of<00:01:07.439> half<00:01:07.650> dummy<00:01:08.189> so<00:01:08.700> I<00:01:08.729> give<00:01:09.090> it<00:01:09.119> a<00:01:09.330> bit<00:01:09.540> of<00:01:09.570> a

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
of half dummy so I give it a bit of a

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.510 
of half dummy so I give it a bit of a
shake<00:01:10.049> and<00:01:10.380> then<00:01:10.500> you<00:01:10.680> can<00:01:10.830> see<00:01:11.040> the<00:01:11.159> liquid

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
shake and then you can see the liquid

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.000 
shake and then you can see the liquid
frisket<00:01:11.729> coming<00:01:12.270> to<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.450> top<00:01:12.659> and<00:01:12.930> I<00:01:13.590> can<00:01:13.799> just

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
frisket coming to the top and I can just

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.749 
frisket coming to the top and I can just
simply<00:01:14.520> decide<00:01:15.180> how<00:01:15.799> narrow<00:01:16.799> I<00:01:17.100> want<00:01:17.430> my<00:01:17.549> line

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
simply decide how narrow I want my line

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.719 
simply decide how narrow I want my line
to<00:01:17.970> be<00:01:18.119> with<00:01:18.450> my<00:01:18.630> ruling<00:01:18.960> pin<00:01:19.170> and<00:01:19.380> dip<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.549> tip

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
to be with my ruling pin and dip the tip

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.940 
to be with my ruling pin and dip the tip
of<00:01:20.790> it<00:01:21.000> into<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.509> first<00:01:21.720> kit<00:01:21.930> you<00:01:22.590> can<00:01:22.740> see

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
of it into the first kit you can see

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.580 
of it into the first kit you can see
that<00:01:23.130> it's<00:01:23.280> holding<00:01:23.580> a<00:01:24.060> bit<00:01:24.900> of<00:01:25.020> frisket<00:01:25.409> right

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
that it's holding a bit of frisket right

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.990 
that it's holding a bit of frisket right
there<00:01:25.799> and<00:01:26.150> then<00:01:27.150> I<00:01:27.479> can<00:01:28.049> use<00:01:28.320> that<00:01:28.619> to<00:01:29.490> follow

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
there and then I can use that to follow

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.480 
there and then I can use that to follow
the<00:01:30.210> lines<00:01:30.390> that<00:01:30.600> I<00:01:30.689> want<00:01:30.900> to<00:01:31.020> make<00:01:31.170> and<00:01:31.490> it's

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
the lines that I want to make and it's

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.630 
the lines that I want to make and it's
much<00:01:33.150> more<00:01:33.420> precise<00:01:33.869> than<00:01:34.340> using<00:01:35.340> a<00:01:35.430> brush

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
much more precise than using a brush

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.969 
much more precise than using a brush
head<00:01:35.909> bead<00:01:36.090> and<00:01:36.409> I<00:01:37.409> find<00:01:37.680> it<00:01:37.799> much<00:01:37.920> more

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
head bead and I find it much more

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.359 
head bead and I find it much more
enjoyable<00:01:38.310> to<00:01:38.759> use<00:01:38.790> and<00:01:39.439> then<00:01:40.439> the<00:01:40.619> cleanup<00:01:41.159> is

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
enjoyable to use and then the cleanup is

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.460 
enjoyable to use and then the cleanup is
much<00:01:41.549> easier<00:01:41.970> because<00:01:42.150> you<00:01:42.450> can<00:01:42.600> just<00:01:43.170> sort<00:01:43.409> of

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
much easier because you can just sort of

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.109 
much easier because you can just sort of
pick<00:01:43.740> off<00:01:43.950> the<00:01:44.189> gummy<00:01:44.369> dried<00:01:44.700> bits<00:01:44.939> when

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
pick off the gummy dried bits when

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.260 
pick off the gummy dried bits when
you're<00:01:45.240> done<00:01:45.360> and<00:01:46.189> you<00:01:47.189> can<00:01:47.430> adjust<00:01:47.939> how

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
you're done and you can adjust how

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.899 
you're done and you can adjust how
narrow<00:01:48.840> you<00:01:48.960> want<00:01:49.229> your<00:01:49.409> line<00:01:49.590> to<00:01:49.770> be<00:01:49.890> and<00:01:50.130> it

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
narrow you want your line to be and it

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:56.469 
narrow you want your line to be and it
provides<00:01:51.329> a<00:01:51.570> lot<00:01:51.990> more<00:01:52.530> control

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:56.479 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:59.359 

so<00:01:57.479> just<00:01:57.780> a<00:01:57.869> little<00:01:57.990> example<00:01:58.200> there<00:01:58.680> I'll<00:01:59.130> let

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
so just a little example there I'll let

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.289 
so just a little example there I'll let
it<00:01:59.430> dry<00:01:59.729> and<00:01:59.909> then<00:02:00.479> I<00:02:00.990> will<00:02:01.530> show<00:02:01.770> you<00:02:01.830> how<00:02:02.100> I

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:02.299 
it dry and then I will show you how I

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:05.630 
it dry and then I will show you how I
how<00:02:03.299> about<00:02:03.330> the<00:02:04.080> effect<00:02:04.290> of<00:02:04.380> it<00:02:04.500> has<00:02:04.619> been<00:02:04.800> all

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
how about the effect of it has been all

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.999 
how about the effect of it has been all
right<00:02:05.760> so<00:02:06.060> back<00:02:06.420> again<00:02:06.780> with<00:02:07.140> the<00:02:07.380> frisket<00:02:07.860> now

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
right so back again with the frisket now

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.100 
right so back again with the frisket now
dry<00:02:08.340> you<00:02:08.880> can<00:02:08.910> see<00:02:09.240> the<00:02:09.360> finished<00:02:09.660> leaf<00:02:09.869> and

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
dry you can see the finished leaf and

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.530 
dry you can see the finished leaf and
some<00:02:10.619> of<00:02:10.770> the<00:02:10.890> detail<00:02:11.310> and<00:02:11.610> the<00:02:11.790> lines<00:02:12.180> that

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
some of the detail and the lines that

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.199 
some of the detail and the lines that
are<00:02:12.720> possible<00:02:13.140> and<00:02:13.319> here<00:02:14.160> is<00:02:14.340> also<00:02:14.700> another

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209 
are possible and here is also another

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:17.510 
are possible and here is also another
look<00:02:15.450> at<00:02:15.660> the<00:02:15.840> ruling<00:02:16.319> pin<00:02:16.530> and<00:02:16.770> the<00:02:17.280> little

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
look at the ruling pin and the little

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.460 
look at the ruling pin and the little
pinchy<00:02:17.819> parts<00:02:18.120> as<00:02:18.360> I<00:02:18.569> so<00:02:18.810> eloquently

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
pinchy parts as I so eloquently

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.530 
pinchy parts as I so eloquently
described<00:02:20.100> and<00:02:20.370> there's<00:02:21.150> the<00:02:21.330> wheel<00:02:21.450> that

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
described and there's the wheel that

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.300 
described and there's the wheel that
turns<00:02:21.720> them<00:02:22.110> closer<00:02:22.380> or<00:02:22.650> farther<00:02:22.800> apart

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
turns them closer or farther apart

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.340 
turns them closer or farther apart
I'm<00:02:23.430> so<00:02:24.030> just<00:02:24.180> going<00:02:24.300> to<00:02:24.390> paint<00:02:24.569> over<00:02:24.720> the<00:02:25.050> leaf

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
I'm so just going to paint over the leaf

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.590 
I'm so just going to paint over the leaf
now<00:02:25.560> and<00:02:25.800> then<00:02:26.400> once<00:02:26.640> it's<00:02:26.880> dry<00:02:27.120> and<00:02:27.300> come<00:02:27.450> back

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
now and then once it's dry and come back

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.759 
now and then once it's dry and come back
and<00:02:27.840> you<00:02:28.019> can<00:02:28.200> see<00:02:28.380> how<00:02:28.830> the<00:02:28.890> lines<00:02:29.220> worked<00:02:29.489> out

00:02:30.759 --> 00:02:30.769 
and you can see how the lines worked out

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:34.130 
and you can see how the lines worked out
the<00:02:31.769> paint<00:02:32.010> is<00:02:32.280> dry<00:02:32.700> so<00:02:33.360> I'm<00:02:33.450> going<00:02:33.720> to<00:02:33.780> remove

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
the paint is dry so I'm going to remove

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.040 
the paint is dry so I'm going to remove
the<00:02:34.380> first<00:02:34.590> kit<00:02:34.800> this<00:02:35.340> is<00:02:35.400> always<00:02:35.760> a<00:02:36.420> fun<00:02:36.810> part

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
the first kit this is always a fun part

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:40.759 
the first kit this is always a fun part
I<00:02:37.290> think<00:02:38.010> anyway<00:02:38.580> so<00:02:39.150> what<00:02:40.019> I<00:02:40.050> usually<00:02:40.380> like<00:02:40.620> to

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:40.769 
I think anyway so what I usually like to

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:44.000 
I think anyway so what I usually like to
do<00:02:40.980> is<00:02:41.370> take<00:02:41.880> a<00:02:42.150> bit<00:02:42.720> that's<00:02:43.080> dried<00:02:43.530> on<00:02:43.950> the

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
do is take a bit that's dried on the

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.030 
do is take a bit that's dried on the
first<00:02:44.370> kit<00:02:44.580> and<00:02:44.790> use<00:02:45.510> that<00:02:45.780> to<00:02:46.110> remove<00:02:46.620> what's

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
first kit and use that to remove what's

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.340 
first kit and use that to remove what's
on<00:02:47.220> the<00:02:47.340> paper<00:02:47.550> and<00:02:47.910> some<00:02:48.750> people<00:02:49.019> like<00:02:49.170> to<00:02:49.200> use

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
on the paper and some people like to use

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.890 
on the paper and some people like to use
their<00:02:49.680> fingers<00:02:49.910> some<00:02:50.910> people<00:02:51.209> like<00:02:51.390> to<00:02:51.420> use<00:02:51.600> an

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
their fingers some people like to use an

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.360 
their fingers some people like to use an
eraser<00:02:52.140> and<00:02:52.620> I<00:02:53.160> find<00:02:54.080> I'd<00:02:55.080> rather<00:02:55.319> not<00:02:55.590> get<00:02:55.890> the

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
eraser and I find I'd rather not get the

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:59.900 
eraser and I find I'd rather not get the
oil<00:02:57.000> from<00:02:57.239> my<00:02:57.420> fingers<00:02:57.780> onto<00:02:58.110> the<00:02:58.530> paper<00:02:58.680> and<00:02:59.040> I

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
oil from my fingers onto the paper and I

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:01.910 
oil from my fingers onto the paper and I
find<00:03:00.269> an<00:03:00.390> eraser<00:03:00.810> will<00:03:00.959> sometimes<00:03:01.320> lift<00:03:01.560> paint

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
find an eraser will sometimes lift paint

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.819 
find an eraser will sometimes lift paint
along<00:03:02.430> with<00:03:02.730> frisket<00:03:03.329> so<00:03:04.110> I<00:03:04.140> just<00:03:04.350> use<00:03:04.500> it<00:03:04.530> like

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:04.829 
along with frisket so I just use it like

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:07.670 
along with frisket so I just use it like
you<00:03:05.700> might<00:03:05.970> use<00:03:06.150> bubblegum<00:03:06.750> to<00:03:07.290> take<00:03:07.500> off

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
you might use bubblegum to take off

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.590 
you might use bubblegum to take off
other<00:03:07.890> bubblegum<00:03:08.400> and<00:03:08.549> just<00:03:08.880> kind<00:03:09.120> of<00:03:09.180> pick<00:03:09.480> it

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:09.600 
other bubblegum and just kind of pick it

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:18.940 
other bubblegum and just kind of pick it
up<00:03:09.690> off<00:03:09.870> the<00:03:10.049> paper

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:18.950 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:23.280 

you

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:26.860 

and<00:03:24.290> then<00:03:25.189> you<00:03:25.310> can<00:03:25.459> see<00:03:25.640> how<00:03:25.939> nice<00:03:26.209> and<00:03:26.540> clear

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
and then you can see how nice and clear

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:29.379 
and then you can see how nice and clear
and<00:03:26.900> smooth<00:03:27.590> the<00:03:27.859> lines<00:03:28.069> are<00:03:28.340> when<00:03:28.969> you<00:03:29.180> use<00:03:29.359> a

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:29.389 
and smooth the lines are when you use a

00:03:29.389 --> 00:03:33.249 
and smooth the lines are when you use a
rolling<00:03:29.810> pin<00:03:30.049> yeah<00:03:30.620> really<00:03:30.920> pens
