00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.120
 hello today i want to tell you 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.670
 about knife 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.020
 Finnish martini firm is the largest on 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.849
 present moment manufacturer 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.860
 classic finnish knives 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.349
 they of course mostly miss fixes q 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.480
 with wooden handles classic 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:18.060
 build a blade but they have a small 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.340
 ruler and folding knives 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.550
 here is one of these knives is a martini knife 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:26.220
 Pelican total length of this knife is 19 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:29.250
 centimeters blade length 8 centimeters 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:32.450
 blade thickness of 3 millimeters is enough 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:35.730
 such a thick blade with a very powerful 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:36.649
 tip in size if you compare it with 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.090
 buck vantage 

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:41.989
 how common pressure will be 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.989
 a little bit smaller 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:48.090
 descending two thirds of the blade 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:51.170
 words concave lens 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:53.969
 lucky enough and nice geometry 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:57.239
 fluoroplastic washers due to them are very 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:59.609
 such a smooth soft move knife of course 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.079
 designed for two two sleeves 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.480
 opening one with one hand he 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.880
 opens with difficulty but there is 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.549
 opportunity nonetheless to pry him 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:11.040
 fingers for this small notch and smoothly 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:13.950
 so open here of course there is still there 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:17.159
 opportunity to customize that is in 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:20.280
 This hole can be inserted which bolt 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:22.439
 and make a peg accordingly 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:26.549
 at least I have such thoughts 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:30.090
 on this account the thickness of the handle half 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:31.860
 centimeter open design overlay 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.290
 made of rubber which is very easy 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:38.159
 it is warming up at all very comfortable 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:41.430
 it feels like something croton 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:44.490
 powerful axial screw but in fact if 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:47.000
 to disassemble the legs to win there is not so much 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:50.369
 big just the head itself 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.380
 this bolt on a very big as well in 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:55.350
 In principle, it is more 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:58.530
 design solution well liner 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.899
 comes to the beginning of the heel quite 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.220
 normal average size sense 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:07.480
 liner thickness 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:09.550
 on two races this knife is made 

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:11.530
 Bank is also stubborn for 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:13.780
 plenochka that is naturally no 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:16.210
 there is no backlash everything keeps perfectly 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:19.570
 tightly not transverse not longitudinal 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:22.120
 backlash no hold it comfortably enough 

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:24.220
 This was exactly the exact grip of the knife. 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.440
 basically made to work on wood 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:28.660
 so when it is capable of just under a little 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:31.450
 Exactly due to the fact that the thickness 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:35.010
 the handle is big enough, he never 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:37.959
 us on and you can fine them 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:40.150
 This is not enough to keep such grip 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:43.660
 convenient because the liner stands here 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:47.500
 and accordingly a little by us on it 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:50.709
 finger in this place is very convenient also 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.610
 keep it that way for cutting 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:54.820
 some kind of game 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:57.370
 that is, the grip of the blade is fine 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:59.020
 In general, ergonomics plan handle is very 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:01.930
 comfortable and although it looks a little bit she 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:02.940
 unusual but nevertheless really 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:05.709
 very comfortably 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:08.680
 the weakest point of this knife and bills 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:12.040
 his steel steel here applies x 46 x 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:17.350
 you 13 is the equivalent of actually Russian 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:20.140
 steel 40x 13 or 420 nose normal 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:22.090
 decent hardness 55 56 units i 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:24.850
 I used the knife for three 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:28.410
 weeks I can say that it is not 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:32.830
 plasticine steel and honestly let's say 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:35.049
 55 56 units are here though of course for 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:37.870
 such a knife could be put and 

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:38.440
 more serious steel well, nothing 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:41.019
 can you do 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:44.980
 the knife is basically designed for hunting 

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:47.110
 for planing wood for the forest he 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:49.560
 absolutely not suitable for daily 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:53.530
 wearing and not intended for this 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:55.420
 the knife weighs 110 grams i.e. it is 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:04:00.310
 principle is quite light despite being 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:00.970
 that there are not lite liners here and in 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:03.190
 principle 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:05.739
 exactly as an auxiliary hunting knife 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:07.570
 fits perfectly 

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:09.959
 due to open design 

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:13.360
 light enough glass and grip 

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:16.329
 rubber which again is enough 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:17.380
 easy to clean and does not absorb any 

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:20.620
 odors 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:23.080
 that is the principle for their tasks for 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:25.090
 those goals that the manufacturer to him 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:28.180
 makes it fit quite normally 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:29.950
 still steel would be more abruptly at all would be 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:32.530
 wonderful about the cost of the knife on 

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:35.290
 the official website of 35 euros in my opinion 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:35.950
 This very many for such a knife from such 

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:38.200
 of materials 

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:42.010
 Well, I can only explain this by saying that 

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:44.620
 This knife is made in Finnish factories. 

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:47.530
 accordingly, the price here is pure 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:49.720
 European I donâ€™t know where he is 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:51.790
 made now because here 

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:54.510
 this knife is already quite a lot of time we 

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:58.720
 produce there almost two years ago 

00:04:54.510 --> 00:05:00.130
 now when rapala bought 

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:04.660
 martini company 

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:06.610
 transferred most of the orders to their 

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:09.220
 China's factories are possible that he even 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:12.490
 done in china i don't say anything about it 

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:13.300
 I know but I can say what's done 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:15.419
 qualitatively 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:18.820
 there is a certain thought in it 

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:21.310
 designer and in general quite and 

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:25.350
 very good knife here such 

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:29.550
 knife from the Finnish company in March less 

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:29.550
 Thank you for your attention and goodbye
