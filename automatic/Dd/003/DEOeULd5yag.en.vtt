00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
little bit of barbarians and archers to

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.780 
little bit of barbarians and archers to
fill<00:01:03.840> in<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:04.019> extra<00:01:04.290> spaces<00:01:04.589> but<00:01:05.250> basically

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
fill in the extra spaces but basically

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.170 
fill in the extra spaces but basically
what<00:01:06.090> Geary<00:01:06.540> is<00:01:06.689> it's<00:01:07.080> just<00:01:07.229> a<00:01:07.970> switch<00:01:08.970> of<00:01:09.150> the

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
what Geary is it's just a switch of the

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.350 
what Geary is it's just a switch of the
giants<00:01:09.689> and<00:01:09.810> golems<00:01:10.290> so<00:01:10.890> that<00:01:11.220> you<00:01:12.060> can<00:01:12.180> just

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
giants and golems so that you can just

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.760 
giants and golems so that you can just
switch<00:01:12.479> those<00:01:12.630> out<00:01:12.810> and<00:01:12.990> that's<00:01:13.409> basically

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
switch those out and that's basically

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.850 
switch those out and that's basically
what<00:01:13.950> giving<00:01:14.310> gowipe<00:01:15.299> I<00:01:15.600> mean<00:01:15.960> kiwi<00:01:16.530> and

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
what giving gowipe I mean kiwi and

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.620 
what giving gowipe I mean kiwi and
gowiwi<00:01:17.340> that's<00:01:17.759> the<00:01:17.880> only<00:01:18.060> difference<00:01:18.180> in

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
gowiwi that's the only difference in

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.660 
gowiwi that's the only difference in
those<00:01:19.080> two<00:01:19.320> is<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:19.710> Giants<00:01:20.070> and<00:01:20.220> the<00:01:20.310> golems

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
those two is the Giants and the golems

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.219 
those two is the Giants and the golems
and<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:21.270> reason<00:01:21.540> you<00:01:21.600> would<00:01:21.689> switch<00:01:21.869> this<00:01:22.049> out

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
and the reason you would switch this out

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.620 
and the reason you would switch this out
is<00:01:22.380> what<00:01:22.979> you<00:01:23.130> guys<00:01:23.250> can<00:01:23.490> see<00:01:23.670> in<00:01:23.850> this<00:01:24.299> video

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
is what you guys can see in this video

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.270 
is what you guys can see in this video
that<00:01:24.840> Giants<00:01:25.439> can<00:01:25.560> actually<00:01:25.830> work<00:01:26.040> really

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
that Giants can actually work really

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.149 
that Giants can actually work really
well<00:01:26.520> as<00:01:26.790> tanking<00:01:27.299> as<00:01:27.450> much<00:01:28.200> as<00:01:28.380> golems<00:01:28.829> do<00:01:28.950> and

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
well as tanking as much as golems do and

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.319 
well as tanking as much as golems do and
they're<00:01:29.310> a<00:01:29.340> lot<00:01:29.520> cheaper<00:01:29.549> they<00:01:30.000> only<00:01:30.090> use<00:01:30.299> a

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
they're a lot cheaper they only use a

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:31.609 
they're a lot cheaper they only use a
lecture<00:01:30.689> they<00:01:30.810> don't<00:01:30.990> use<00:01:31.110> your<00:01:31.200> dark<00:01:31.439> elixir

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
lecture they don't use your dark elixir

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.649 
lecture they don't use your dark elixir
so<00:01:32.220> sometimes<00:01:32.700> I<00:01:32.820> switch<00:01:33.030> them<00:01:33.210> out<00:01:33.360> use<00:01:33.630> the

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
so sometimes I switch them out use the

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.420 
so sometimes I switch them out use the
Giants<00:01:34.200> asset<00:01:34.439> of<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:34.619> golems<00:01:34.979> and<00:01:35.070> I

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
Giants asset of the golems and I

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.100 
Giants asset of the golems and I
actually<00:01:35.640> really<00:01:36.030> like<00:01:36.240> the<00:01:36.509> strategy<00:01:36.900> a<00:01:36.930> lot

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
actually really like the strategy a lot

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.330 
actually really like the strategy a lot
I<00:01:37.170> don't<00:01:37.290> know<00:01:37.470> if<00:01:37.560> I<00:01:37.619> like<00:01:37.740> it<00:01:37.890> better<00:01:38.009> than<00:01:38.159> go

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340
