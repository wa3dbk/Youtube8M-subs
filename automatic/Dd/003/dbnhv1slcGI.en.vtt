though<00:01:59.270> my<00:01:59.299> hair<00:01:59.689> is<00:01:59.899> not<00:02:00.110> very<00:02:00.409> long<00:02:00.709> it<00:02:01.549> soaks

00:02:01.959 --> 00:02:01.969 
though my hair is not very long it soaks

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:03.999 
though my hair is not very long it soaks
up<00:02:02.179> product<00:02:02.689> like<00:02:03.110> you<00:02:03.349> would<00:02:03.530> not<00:02:03.770> believe

00:02:03.999 --> 00:02:04.009 
up product like you would not believe

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:07.809 
up product like you would not believe
and<00:02:04.849> it<00:02:05.840> is<00:02:06.079> very<00:02:06.379> dense<00:02:06.649> so<00:02:07.069> it<00:02:07.099> definitely

00:02:07.809 --> 00:02:07.819 
and it is very dense so it definitely

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:10.150 
and it is very dense so it definitely
needs<00:02:08.090> a<00:02:08.299> lot<00:02:08.629> of<00:02:08.690> tint<00:02:09.140> in<00:02:09.410> order<00:02:09.860> to<00:02:10.009> make

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
needs a lot of tint in order to make

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.100 
needs a lot of tint in order to make
