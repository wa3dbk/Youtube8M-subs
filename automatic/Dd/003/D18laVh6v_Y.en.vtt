I can show you fits it really fits in
there<00:02:41.510> like<00:02:41.540> so<00:02:42.700> in<00:02:43.700> the<00:02:43.849> backside<00:02:44.299> we<00:02:45.049> got

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
there like so in the backside we got

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.199 
there like so in the backside we got
three<00:02:45.470> little<00:02:45.650> holes<00:02:45.829> and<00:02:46.819> make<00:02:46.940> sure<00:02:47.060> that

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:47.209 
three little holes and make sure that

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:49.210 
three little holes and make sure that
one<00:02:47.420> notch<00:02:47.630> is<00:02:47.870> in<00:02:48.019> there<00:02:48.200> so<00:02:48.380> it<00:02:48.470> fits<00:02:48.680> all<00:02:48.859> the

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
one notch is in there so it fits all the

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.180 
one notch is in there so it fits all the
way<00:02:49.459> to<00:02:49.519> like<00:02:50.150> so<00:02:50.410> and<00:02:51.410> then<00:02:51.560> you're<00:02:51.680> just<00:02:51.829> line

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.190 
way to like so and then you're just line

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:54.190 
way to like so and then you're just line
it<00:02:52.220> up<00:02:52.489> in<00:02:52.670> there<00:02:52.819> like<00:02:53.030> you<00:02:53.180> want<00:02:53.389> and<00:02:54.109> you

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
it up in there like you want and you

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:55.900 
it up in there like you want and you
should<00:02:54.290> go<00:02:54.440> it<00:02:54.560> back<00:02:54.709> together<00:02:54.889> push<00:02:55.730> I<00:02:55.880> will

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
should go it back together push I will

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:59.500 
should go it back together push I will
show<00:02:56.389> you<00:02:56.599> engine<00:02:56.900> ok<00:02:57.560> I'm<00:02:57.799> back<00:02:57.829> and<00:02:58.220> go<00:02:58.510> have

forward I don't put this one here snaps
right<00:04:20.549> out<00:04:20.790> when<00:04:21.090> he<00:04:21.180> was<00:04:21.269> a<00:04:21.299> little<00:04:21.570> circuit

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 
right out when he was a little circuit

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:23.450 
right out when he was a little circuit
water<00:04:22.049> yeah<00:04:22.230> that's<00:04:22.440> a<00:04:22.530> brand<00:04:22.830> you<00:04:23.190> won't<00:04:23.370> look

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460 
water yeah that's a brand you won't look

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:25.850 
water yeah that's a brand you won't look
at<00:04:23.580> it<00:04:23.640> he<00:04:23.970> looks<00:04:24.180> good<00:04:24.600> compared<00:04:25.110> to<00:04:25.140> mine<00:04:25.440> but

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
at it he looks good compared to mine but

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:28.090 
at it he looks good compared to mine but
if<00:04:26.370> she'll<00:04:26.580> get<00:04:26.700> this<00:04:26.910> at<00:04:27.060> a<00:04:27.150> dealership

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:28.100 
if she'll get this at a dealership

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:31.370 
if she'll get this at a dealership
ninety<00:04:29.100> bucks<00:04:29.310> to<00:04:29.550> program<00:04:29.940> it<00:04:30.120> 90<00:04:31.050> bucks<00:04:31.230> I

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:31.380 
ninety bucks to program it 90 bucks I

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:34.400 
ninety bucks to program it 90 bucks I
don't<00:04:31.410> have<00:04:32.450> as<00:04:33.450> you<00:04:33.570> can<00:04:33.690> see<00:04:33.840> a<00:04:33.870> panic<00:04:34.290> alarm

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:34.410 
don't have as you can see a panic alarm

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:35.960 
don't have as you can see a panic alarm
on<00:04:34.710> this<00:04:34.800> one<00:04:34.980> was<00:04:35.130> all<00:04:35.250> messed<00:04:35.550> up<00:04:35.760> and

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:35.970 
on this one was all messed up and

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:38.420 
on this one was all messed up and
everything<00:04:36.360> so<00:04:36.630> that's<00:04:36.840> tilt<00:04:37.110> backwards<00:04:37.430> just

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:38.430 
everything so that's tilt backwards just

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:40.280 
everything so that's tilt backwards just
a<00:04:38.580> better<00:04:38.820> one<00:04:39.000> I<00:04:39.030> just<00:04:39.180> got<00:04:39.510> together<00:04:39.750> here

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:40.290 
a better one I just got together here

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:43.370 
a better one I just got together here
panic<00:04:41.100> alarms<00:04:41.430> good<00:04:41.669> I<00:04:41.910> think<00:04:42.330> putting<00:04:43.200> it<00:04:43.320> all
