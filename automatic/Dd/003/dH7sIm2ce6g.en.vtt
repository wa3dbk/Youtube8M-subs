00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.810
 in the last video of the day of the new dlc 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.160
 high life and finally carved because 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.510
 I have a pretty tired voice, I'm 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.340
 pretty exhausted and I need a 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.870
 rest to return tomorrow to all 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.009
 with the videos but good guys before 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.870
 to also start telling you that 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.340
 I appreciate a lot the support that 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.990
 you have had in all the videos today 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.800
 that uploaded to my channel all full of the 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.270
 ex everything was filled with comments 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.070
 positive to which a 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.840
 you do not know how good it is that 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.609
 I feel seeing all that positivity 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.769
 part of you so to speak but 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.660
 well let's leave two years and things 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.399
 storekeepers until I do not like anything and 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.899
 then the drawer with the main theme of the 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.340
 video and well then let's investigate 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.110
 little in this video what comes to be the 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.610
 humor that has got into this new dlc 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.920
 highlight and good then the humor 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.870
 obviously it's the little things that are canceled 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.430
 the characters of for example this that 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.230
 we have here that is one of the most 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.820
 funny and there are good 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.870
 things as you already know, even if it's a 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.250
 foolishness but they are the ones that always 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.629
 we use more because when we are 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.980
 as friends we are always doing 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.360
 nonsense of it and I come to show you 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.489
 Well, the new ones that you have put into this 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.809
 new dlc for example it looks has 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.340
 put five new vouchers that are for 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.960
 example is that - according to applause in plan 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.670
 you are already the best in the world plank no 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.730
 ironic applause knows why you hit it 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.620
 as in slow motion look 

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:09.480
 examples in slow motion and good because the 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:11.640
 next is the embarrassment of others 

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:13.020
 it's my mother my mother what a shame 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.120
 is the sale for anyone who knows what 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.350
 means basically means by 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:17.970
 example when your friend goes down the street 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.710
 and maybe he falls in front of all the 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.110
 world that plan as you stay 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.730
 feeling ashamed of luxury in madrid 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.950
 because Canada has just made gave 

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:27.480
 basically this this action is the same 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.610
 they use us, my mother, I wanted her so 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:31.290
 half what a shame it would give me I'm 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.390
 seeing how he does it good here we have 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.100
 the one of cojonudo that exemplary ok in plan 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.750
 perfect aerobics with both thumbs 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.580
 upwards after we have the one of this 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.610
 chance that is pretty funny is silver 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:42.960
 as surprises so to speak two and 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.210
 then finally we have is a 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.040
 place in the nose not that is this street 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.200
 the snot pellet and the strip and 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.150
 ground as I'm watching pound takes me and 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.890
 you give me a stick the mother pellet 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:56.369
 mine and well well also tell you that 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:58.229
 example if you want to do the one we have 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.340
 around here they detail for example without 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.540
 have to open the menu because the only thing 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.950
 what you have to do is press the two 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.350
 downward joysticks go the pulsaáis 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.729
 twice in a row 6 click click and look 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.110
 it makes it only worth it without having to give anything 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.670
 and as I say what you have to do is 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.080
 hit the left joystick and 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.850
 right joystick to the two levers as 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.350
 want to call him 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:15.910
 Stress and stress is called work 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:17.320
 twice in a row super fast and what 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.670
 it makes only worth but also a 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:20.350
 curiosity is that if you give it three times 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.590
 continued to overcome it look what one does 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:22.590
 two and three 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:31.069
 now what makes it like more exaggerated 

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:31.069
 he also goes out with him 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.760
 to the bottom of what was called this 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:38.069
 there we are the background if you give him three 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.959
 times in a row you can do this there is what 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:42.359
 I saw it as much more as much more 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:44.549
 exaggerated papi pampín quite nobel 

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:45.810
 is crazy the character goes crazy and 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:47.750
 the time is a pretty good curiosity 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:50.099
 some guys put have all been 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:51.510
 gestures that have added in this new dlc 

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:53.430
 it was for the gesture enough for titles 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:55.620
 and nothing because here I say goodbye to the side of 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.970
 my friend that environment that good is a 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.139
 car is not a friend but good 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:00.060
 let's leave it there for me it's a friend 

00:02:58.139 --> 00:03:01.680
 as more like a brother because of the theme of 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.090
 this car took me more time to the side 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.129
 to make it all sank to see this 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.540
 car is awesome has been a boy 

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:08.069
 as I say here I say goodbye with my super 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.810
 true at 62 from the garage to see if 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:11.549
 you come out the truth is that it says with a 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.840
 black screen is rather shabby 

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:14.549
 so let's let the car take off 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:17.010
 there you have my tenth of perfect day 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:18.090
 when boy without committing next 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.409
 is this video you can leave a team 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.639
