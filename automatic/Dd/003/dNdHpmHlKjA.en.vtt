00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Respect and honor 
to our forefathers, 
and our Gods! 

00:00:04.159 --> 00:00:10.519
In the motionless space Yotengrit, the 
all-pervasive God rests. 
Then he moves and creates.

00:00:11.119 --> 00:00:16.199
the twin-vortex comes into existence,
which implies the development.

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.159
So he pervades every part of our world.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.039
a great celestial gold-mother: Anyahita.

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:32.279
My dear sons, today in the depths of 
times I can speak to you again:

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.759
Everything is allowed which does not 
harm anyone else! Do not hurt, 
do not harm, protect, help!

00:00:40.599 --> 00:00:44.719
Deep knowledge of our ancestors was handed 
down to us up to this day.

00:00:44.799 --> 00:00:49.519
This knowledge and spiritual power 
can still help us, since it lives in us. 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:57.279
My sons, let your hearts hear 
Yotengrit's words! 
One, from One to Two, Two and One.

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:03.559
Hey, this day
has come!

00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:07.639
On a white horse 
with golden reins,

00:01:07.639 --> 00:01:10.199
a velvet saddle,
and silver stirrups.

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:15.559
The horse is saddled for God
by his old, faithful people.

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:20.679
The son of the Heavenly Mounted-God: 
Level

00:01:30.559 --> 00:01:36.000
In the old days, the great hero Ma, 
or Matyo, united the horse-riding 
nations again.

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:42.319
After his death, he incarnated as 
a god and carried on helping the 
nations of mounted archers.

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:46.000
This is why our sons worshiped him as Ma-Tun.

00:01:47.199 --> 00:01:51.319
Alpaslan's son, Buda died, and the great 
Hun alliance disintegrated. 

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:54.000
Level become the monarch.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:02.000
He relied on Isbor the Szekely, i.e. 
the monarch of Gimbelar, and on Acsad, 
the leader of Kangar-Pechenegs.

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:10.319
Thus increasing the number of nations 
to three, from which the Hungarian 
people later grew.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Although countless paid woman lived in 
his lovely palace, he did not revel in them,  

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.359
because he longed for a true wife.
He visited his mother, Anik

00:02:23.759 --> 00:02:28.639
but you yourself have to attend to 
producing a grandchild who can follow 
in your footsteps, my dear child.

00:02:28.639 --> 00:02:30.399
Now the time should come!

00:02:38.119 --> 00:02:43.719
they beheld a beautiful red deer.
The men made after it straight away.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:52.399
However, Level felt that the deer could 
never be killed,because it was a ghost deer,

00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:58.559
I am not a wild beast to kill, 
I am not a killer beast either.  

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000
My horn ignites without being lit, the flame 
burns out without being extinguished.

00:03:04.399 --> 00:03:08.239
The corncrake sings in the grass, 
I am a woman myself,

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:16.239
he passed nearby the town of Gazan Kagan 
along the Ethyl, but he did not 
stumble across anyone,

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:20.000
because a strong spell protected them. 
They pitched camp.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.279
Whose sons are you? What are your names? 
And what the hell are you scratching 
away at each other for?

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.399
We are Uytigur and Kuytigur, Circassian 
princes, twins of Adugey. 

00:03:33.399 --> 00:03:38.319
Anger does not bother us, but we are 
fighting to the death over the 
daughter of King Gyul.

00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:44.079
When they got closer to the source of music, 
they gasped for breath

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.000
as they glimpsed many nude girls bathing  
in the lake of fairies.

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:56.000
Level succeeded in catching Princess 
Gyongyver, and lifted her up to the saddle,

00:03:56.639 --> 00:04:03.599
Therefore the men soothed the women, 
everyone said to his own the following:

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.079
I love you very much, little girl.  
I was a wolf; I will be a lamp.

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:12.000
your wish will be my only interest.
Hey, I place my life into your hands!

00:04:13.639 --> 00:04:17.039
A thrush perched on the willow. 
I am not the daughter of whoever:

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:24.000
I don't give myself to anyone -- 
I say goodbye to my spirit, hey - 
I would rather die!

00:04:24.439 --> 00:04:30.399
Gyongyver saw the sun-moon-horse-tailed
war banner on Level's tent,

00:04:30.399 --> 00:04:35.319
she already realized that fate had not 
swept her along to just anybody

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:44.000
Level sent a message to King Gyul to send an 
order of seventy-seven ornate clothes and one 
order of even more ornate clothes without delay.

00:04:44.559 --> 00:04:50.639
if he doesn't want her daughter and her 
companions to be brought naked to the wedding.

00:04:51.439 --> 00:04:57.479
King Gyul soon arrived, not only with 
the clothes, but with the very best of 
his warriors as well.

00:04:59.559 --> 00:05:05.359
At the sight of the army, Level and his 
companions drew their bows 
and arrows immediately.

00:05:06.079 --> 00:05:08.479
So did King Gyul's warriors.

00:05:08.479 --> 00:05:14.000
Let us fight with each other, Ma's son, 
Level. Let us fight as shamans fight!

00:05:18.079 --> 00:05:24.000
King Gyul turned into a red bull. 
Level turned into a blue bull. 
They fought and grappled,

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.319
but neither one could defeat the other, 
and what is more, it seemed 
that the red bull won.

00:05:30.399 --> 00:05:38.399
This strong nation, while remaining faithful 
to Ma-Tun, the God residing in the sky, 
will be overwhelmed by no one and nothing!

00:05:40.799 --> 00:05:49.639
Level went back to his Sabir home accompanied 
by White Bolars and found his country in trouble,

00:05:50.079 --> 00:05:53.000
because they had multiplied during his absence.

00:05:53.399 --> 00:05:55.159
Therefore, with half the people he departed. 

00:05:56.079 --> 00:06:01.199
Level arrived with such a great army to Asov, 
where new forces were needed. 

00:06:05.279 --> 00:06:13.000
The Gazan Khagan was so frightened of the new, 
strong power that he never come for taxes again, 

00:06:13.799 --> 00:06:18.279
Lady Gyongyver gave birth to a male child  
who was named Leved.

00:06:18.679 --> 00:06:25.639
When he grew up, he married the daughter of 
Gazan Khagan,  Karagul, which means "Black Rose."

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:36.679
The people held together by the Gazan force 
thought that  the time had come to shake off 
the yoke of the Khagan, but they were defeated.

00:06:39.799 --> 00:06:49.639
Two leaders, Karan and Kurbad, with their tribes
asked for the protection of Leved, and the Khagan
was afraid of picking a quarrel with the Magyars.

00:06:49.639 --> 00:06:58.000
Ma-Tun, the God of the Magyars!
He is with us, lives with us, fights with us!

00:06:58.599 --> 00:07:02.599
The Leved-guided, mounted tribes invokes 
Ma-Tun's spirit.

00:07:04.439 --> 00:07:10.359
Everything is proved in its own time, 
in its own surroundings: helpful or harmful!

00:07:13.079 --> 00:07:18.159
In this matter the unwise should follow the wiser, 
and unity should be kept,

00:07:18.159 --> 00:07:24.039
because each disagreement weakens my strength, 
and I am your protector God! 

00:07:25.519 --> 00:07:30.039
Leved strengthened his country 
without bothering other folks,

00:07:30.039 --> 00:07:34.799
only a few Northern Slavic folks  
were taken under his protection,

00:07:34.799 --> 00:07:39.439
because they had starved a lot, 
so they had to steal and rob.

00:07:40.279 --> 00:07:44.000
Leved taught them and forced them 
to till their fields. 

00:07:44.719 --> 00:07:48.359
Leved's authority spread to the Vareg Sea.

00:07:51.359 --> 00:07:59.519
This is the history of the country, Asoflu-Savard, 
the beginning of the alliance of Ma-Gur, 
the Hungarian nation's seed.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:07.000
Anyone who does not believe it is free to think 
differently or to find out for himself. Anyone who 
knows it better should tell it better.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.559
That's how we know, because the Three Ancestors 
left it for us like that.
