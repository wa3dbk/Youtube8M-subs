00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 hello today we will continue the series 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.670
 video reviews about air conditioners 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.410
 very often the buyer is lost in 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.099
 guess what brand to choose 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.380
 air conditioning 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:11.910
 to simplify the task we chose the most 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.740
 popular brands of budget series 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.839
 air conditioners and in the lab 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.369
 conducted a comparative analysis for 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.289
 comparisons we selected household 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.990
 split systems of different brands with 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.010
 with the same capacity of 9 thousand, we compared 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.340
 conditional brands 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:28.890
 abcd and mitsushito dg series 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.720
 and mitsushito lg series equipment 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:34.050
 compared by several parameters 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.489
 So 1 appearance and packaging here were 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.050
 minor differences that 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.450
 the consumer will hardly notice 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.280
 second option grade both 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.500
 it turned out air conditioners 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.539
 also not very different and finally 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.370
 third design features and 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.860
 the ratio of declared and real 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.559
 characteristics here an expert he is about 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.629
 how to say the weight of heat exchangers 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.320
 differed from the stated at 24 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.390
 kilogram 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.699
 it made me think that somewhere 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.829
 cycle when disassembling the equipment we 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.409
 found that the design and overall 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.850
 the dimensions of the heat exchangers were different it 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.820
 says that the heat exchange area 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.740
 miscellaneous and equipment with a smaller area 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.140
 heat exchanger will work less 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.619
 efficient compressor power difference 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.150
 accounted for about 20 15 percent 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:20.159
 compressors were installed by 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.590
 designs differently it says 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.580
 that less powerful compressors can 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.980
 give out less 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:29.290
 cold and heat and compressors that are not 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:31.090
 have a protective casing will work 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:33.100
 noise at some models in general 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:35.230
 missing parameter information 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.210
 such as noise level coefficient 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:38.080
 energy efficiency type and power 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:40.210
 compressor 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:42.010
 This analysis does not infringe at all 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:42.370
 rights selected for the examination of trading 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:44.380
 marks 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:46.570
 but still we want to emphasize the level 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.670
 quality brand mitsushito speech 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:49.900
 remind is about the compliance stated 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:52.120
 and real characteristics 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:55.120
 expertise taught stool 6 brands 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:56.740
 and declared characteristics only 2 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:59.050
 trademarks corresponded to real 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.770
 Equipment properties including 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:01.300
 mitsushito 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:02.370
 it says equipment 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:04.660
 mitsushito brand 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:06.610
 manufactured flagships production 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:08.649
 with the highest control burning rage and 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:10.570
 Finally, when choosing the air conditioner 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:13.000
 equipment should be preferred 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:14.830
 the brand that takes care of 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.750
 product quality follows 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:18.970
 compliance with the stated technical 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:21.630
 characteristics and provides the goods by 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.630
 best price
