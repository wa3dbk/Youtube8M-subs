00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:08.250
 Hello everyone, this is a review but very cord 

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:12.509
 You can buy it in any store 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:14.190
 computer technology or on the market with 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:15.420
 one hand it turns out the party 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.619
 space 2 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:28.740
 micro usb let's start all quickly 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:32.759
 tell show you all today will be such 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:36.000
 a small bonus I connected pretty 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:38.579
 still unusual device your phone 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:43.590
 but it will be at the end of the review and so 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:45.649
 connecting to the mouse that we see the foot 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.300
 us cursor appears 

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:48.930
 which exactly works like touch 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.489
 screen 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:59.960
 Well, that is, when you press the same finger 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:01:03.989
 the very principle can be cut fruit well 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:08.100
 special functionality does not add our 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:09.080
 the cursor our mouse can go directly to 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:14.090
 the next 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:17.850
 more reasonable connection disconnect 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:22.020
 keyboard with keyboard all a bit 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:24.840
 in another way I have it 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.479
 which is inconvenient to type text on the phone 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.640
 text features a lot of this 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:32.610
 small buttons do not do it all the time 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.759
 mistakes well and generally accustomed to working with 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.619
 keyboard connect the keyboard 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:42.710
 click well wolf well, it's just for you 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:46.990
 was seen we write 3 4 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:51.930
 everything works the letters also show you 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:56.200
 Well, retrain language shift control 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:58.960
 we see nothing changes the trait and not 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:04.619
 changes naturally tongue bite can 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:09.330
 only in the standard way everything is clear 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:12.940
 so what 's next further with us 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:19.920
 connecting a flash drive and that is 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:19.920
 ordinary flash drives include flash drive 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:30.549
 Immediately we are opened well, and we 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:32.739
 see all the files that are on the flash drive all 

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:34.540
 you can open a text document but it 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:38.080
 depends on the possibility of your 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:42.989
 phone and software years 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:42.989
 on it here I have a presentation 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:47.280
 quietly the presentation opens 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:54.810
 to remove the flash drive is not enough 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:56.840
 become so you can lose data then 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:59.099
 there is exactly like on the computer 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:02.159
 retrieved on safe only 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:06.890
 extracting the dark blue click to 

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:06.890
 extract it from by drive click 

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:20.459
 maybe why everything is so what now now 

00:03:16.969 --> 00:03:21.989
 I 'll show you the camera connection for sure 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:24.870
 so you can connect the camera 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:26.329
 natural and let's download from there 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:33.090
 immediately photos 

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:39.480
 Throw on the phone or video is done 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:43.019
 very simple camera principle camera 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:46.560
 for the phone does not differ from the flash drive 

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:51.510
 i.e. this is the same drive we usually 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:53.900
 and drive with me to watch include 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:53.900
 at first 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:11.800
 so we recognized connected to something 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:16.700
 press ok 

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:19.370
 look to the top five 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:24.250
 Well , we see all that is on the camera 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:28.690
 all folders turns out is located video 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:32.060
 our video phone will not open these formats 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:35.210
 I do not know a man Jessica such a world 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:40.130
 its format only through the computer is necessary 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:43.850
 compile through special 

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:46.670
 programs open as well 

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:49.460
 become lucky did not forget to remove the camera 

00:04:46.670 --> 00:05:00.790
 or the camera does not give a safe 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:05:05.380
 extraction click to the place of the pen 

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:08.830
 what is next the most interesting 

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:12.730
 this is our eraser 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:12.730
 common beating to 

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:19.130
 it doesn't connect like a keyboard then 

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:21.110
 eat now will not be written eat 

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:27.220
 connected mouse and keyboard or what are you 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:27.220
 ready not connect like a joystick and 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:36.950
 so I have already specially prepared one 

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:40.220
 for joystick we see yes nothing 

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:45.260
 it is written that the joystick is absolutely written 

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:47.870
 connected here is our game through 

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:50.050
 sega emulator think friends for many 

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:50.050
 of games 

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:54.840
 to mix 

00:06:03.169 --> 00:06:07.990
 quite comfortable and cool only 

00:06:05.629 --> 00:06:07.990
 play 

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:18.930
 as we see everything works fine here 

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:29.370
 dependent on emulator verses for 

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:35.160
 Settings That is, everything works I think 

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:37.080
 many hally in childhood on sega and myself 

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:41.270
 I remember how much time I spent behind her 

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:44.730
 oh well on this we finish our review
