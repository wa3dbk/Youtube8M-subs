sure<00:04:54.500> takes<00:04:55.220> the<00:04:55.370> weight<00:04:55.520> off<00:04:55.550> it<00:04:55.700> a<00:04:55.880> bit<00:04:56.410> but

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:57.410 
sure takes the weight off it a bit but

00:04:57.410 --> 00:04:59.740 
sure takes the weight off it a bit but
that's<00:04:57.850> so<00:04:58.850> there's<00:04:59.030> a<00:04:59.090> hole<00:04:59.240> in<00:04:59.390> the<00:04:59.450> outside

00:04:59.740 --> 00:04:59.750 
that's so there's a hole in the outside

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:06.580 
that's so there's a hole in the outside

underneath of it they're a bit but
otherwise<00:05:37.690> quite<00:05:38.690> blemish<00:05:39.170> just<00:05:39.380> there<00:05:39.590> so<00:05:39.770> I

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:39.800 
otherwise quite blemish just there so I

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:41.140 
otherwise quite blemish just there so I
think<00:05:39.890> you<00:05:40.040> probably<00:05:40.130> has<00:05:40.370> a<00:05:40.400> roof<00:05:40.640> back<00:05:40.820> on<00:05:40.940> at

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:41.150 
think you probably has a roof back on at

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:45.060
