think<00:00:19.800> it<00:00:20.039> will<00:00:20.100> happen<00:00:20.250> I<00:00:20.609> don't<00:00:21.150> want<00:00:21.300> it<00:00:21.390> to

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
think it will happen I don't want it to

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.029 
think it will happen I don't want it to
really<00:00:21.660> happen<00:00:21.779> I<00:00:22.050> don't<00:00:22.199> think<00:00:22.529> I<00:00:22.650> think<00:00:22.949> it's

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
really happen I don't think I think it's

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.370 
really happen I don't think I think it's
a<00:00:23.130> fight<00:00:23.310> that's<00:00:23.490> not<00:00:23.760> necessary<00:00:24.240> it's<00:00:25.109> a<00:00:25.230> good

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
a fight that's not necessary it's a good

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.769 
a fight that's not necessary it's a good
fight<00:00:25.590> but<00:00:26.279> it's<00:00:26.490> a<00:00:27.000> fight<00:00:27.180> that<00:00:27.210> doesn't<00:00:27.689> need

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
fight but it's a fight that doesn't need

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:33.290 
fight but it's a fight that doesn't need
to<00:00:27.840> be<00:00:27.960> made<00:00:28.230> and<00:00:29.630> if<00:00:30.630> it<00:00:30.779> does<00:00:30.929> happen<00:00:31.579> I<00:00:32.579> still

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
to be made and if it does happen I still

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.970 
to be made and if it does happen I still
think<00:00:33.480> it<00:00:33.570> could<00:00:33.600> go<00:00:33.780> either<00:00:33.840> way<00:00:34.050> it<00:00:34.649> to<00:00:34.860> be

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
think it could go either way it to be

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.709 
think it could go either way it to be
honest<00:00:35.160> with<00:00:35.219> you<00:00:35.309> guys<00:00:35.600> if<00:00:36.600> if<00:00:37.500> and<00:00:37.829> only<00:00:37.920> if

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
guy three times you know like three

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.950 
guy three times you know like three
times<00:01:01.440> of<00:01:01.680> course<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:02.039> fighter<00:01:02.399> like<00:01:03.239> Marquez

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
times of course the fighter like Marquez

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.380 
times of course the fighter like Marquez
will<00:01:04.290> learn<00:01:04.500> about<00:01:04.769> it<00:01:04.949> and<00:01:05.100> he'll<00:01:05.250> he'll<00:01:06.210> take

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
will learn about it and he'll he'll take

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.390 
will learn about it and he'll he'll take
advantage<00:01:06.840> of<00:01:06.960> that<00:01:07.140> and<00:01:07.380> that's<00:01:08.280> what

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
advantage of that and that's what

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.880 
advantage of that and that's what
happened<00:01:08.670> in<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:08.790> fourth<00:01:08.970> fight<00:01:09.180> and<00:01:09.680> if<00:01:10.680> he

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
happened in the fourth fight and if he

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.140 
happened in the fourth fight and if he
does<00:01:11.070> that<00:01:11.100> again<00:01:11.340> I<00:01:11.490> think<00:01:11.610> he<00:01:11.909> will<00:01:12.030> get

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
does that again I think he will get

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.370 
does that again I think he will get
knocked<00:01:12.390> out<00:01:12.510> to<00:01:12.689> be<00:01:12.780> honest<00:01:12.930> with<00:01:13.020> you<00:01:13.080> guys<00:01:13.200> I

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
knocked out to be honest with you guys I

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.280 
knocked out to be honest with you guys I
think<00:01:13.590> a<00:01:13.820> lot<00:01:14.820> of<00:01:14.850> people<00:01:14.909> are<00:01:15.479> like<00:01:15.900> calling

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
think a lot of people are like calling

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.249 
think a lot of people are like calling
are<00:01:16.979> considering<00:01:17.610> a<00:01:17.700> Marquez<00:01:18.060> the<00:01:18.210> better<00:01:18.390> the

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
are considering a Marquez the better the

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.289 
are considering a Marquez the better the
better<00:01:19.380> fighter<00:01:19.650> I<00:01:19.979> see<00:01:20.880> it<00:01:20.939> a<00:01:21.000> little<00:01:21.119> bit

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
better fighter I see it a little bit

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.469 
better fighter I see it a little bit
differently<00:01:21.659> I<00:01:21.900> think<00:01:22.710> both<00:01:22.860> guys<00:01:23.070> are

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:23.479 
differently I think both guys are

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:25.760 
differently I think both guys are
equally<00:01:24.479> as<00:01:24.810> good<00:01:25.049> at<00:01:25.229> each<00:01:25.320> other<00:01:25.470> that's<00:01:25.680> why

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
equally as good at each other that's why

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.940 
equally as good at each other that's why
they<00:01:25.860> make<00:01:25.890> an<00:01:26.250> eco<00:01:27.210> fight<00:01:27.450> of<00:01:27.689> all<00:01:28.380> the<00:01:28.740> three

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
they make an eco fight of all the three

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.249 
they make an eco fight of all the three
fights<00:01:29.310> even<00:01:30.060> that<00:01:30.180> fortified<00:01:30.659> was<00:01:30.840> basically

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
fights even that fortified was basically

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:35.359 
fights even that fortified was basically
closed<00:01:31.560> but<00:01:33.229> but<00:01:34.229> Marquez<00:01:34.560> is<00:01:34.770> definitely<00:01:35.250> the

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
closed but but Marquez is definitely the

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.039 
closed but but Marquez is definitely the
smarter<00:01:35.729> fighter<00:01:35.909> he's<00:01:36.180> learned<00:01:36.509> from<00:01:36.900> the

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
smarter fighter he's learned from the

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.260 
smarter fighter he's learned from the
past<00:01:37.200> if<00:01:37.680> you<00:01:38.070> watch<00:01:38.250> from<00:01:38.549> the<00:01:38.670> beginning<00:01:38.759> to

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
past if you watch from the beginning to

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.690 
past if you watch from the beginning to
the<00:01:39.360> end<00:01:39.479> he's<00:01:39.869> been<00:01:40.110> improving<00:01:41.070> in<00:01:41.400> every

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
the end he's been improving in every

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.960 
the end he's been improving in every
single<00:01:41.880> fight<00:01:42.150> and<00:01:43.549> yeah<00:01:44.549> that's<00:01:44.759> what<00:01:44.939> I

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
single fight and yeah that's what I

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.730 
single fight and yeah that's what I
think<00:01:45.240> I<00:01:45.329> think<00:01:45.360> Marcus<00:01:46.110> will<00:01:46.290> knock<00:01:46.470> him<00:01:46.649> out

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
think I think Marcus will knock him out

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.080 
think I think Marcus will knock him out
if<00:01:48.200> Pacquiao<00:01:49.200> keeps<00:01:49.740> doing<00:01:49.950> a<00:01:50.100> pump<00:01:50.340> fake<00:01:50.490> if

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
if Pacquiao keeps doing a pump fake if

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.969 
if Pacquiao keeps doing a pump fake if
he<00:01:51.329> doesn't<00:01:51.479> do<00:01:51.720> that<00:01:51.780> but<00:01:52.259> I<00:01:52.439> think<00:01:52.560> he<00:01:52.799> will

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
he doesn't do that but I think he will

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.249 
he doesn't do that but I think he will
there's<00:01:53.220> there's<00:01:54.180> no<00:01:54.420> way<00:01:54.600> he<00:01:54.780> can't<00:01:55.020> stop

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
there's there's no way he can't stop

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.499 
there's there's no way he can't stop
doing<00:01:55.530> that<00:01:55.619> it's<00:01:55.799> been<00:01:56.100> like<00:01:56.369> it's<00:01:57.030> instilled

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
doing that it's been like it's instilled
