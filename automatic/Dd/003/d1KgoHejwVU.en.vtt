00:00:02.989 --> 00:00:09.629
 among the new compact crossover 

00:00:06.149 --> 00:00:12.420
 There is no doubt that the flame was denied too much. 

00:00:09.629 --> 00:00:15.359
 the attention with this full look of 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:18.270
 personality but he has others 

00:00:15.359 --> 00:00:22.349
 also attractive as it is today. 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:24.419
 I paid the jeep and denied that it arrived 

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:26.910
 generating a lot of expectation for a 

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:29.039
 series of differentials in particular by 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.230
 offer different engine versions 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.270
 four-wheel drive diesel 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.910
 but it is this one that can guarantee the 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.160
 his success is equipped with the engine 1.8 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:41.090
 flex that we brought to the evaluation 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.090
 this week 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:50.180
 in July the renegade entered his 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.220
 third full month of sales 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:55.670
 already in the condition of second best sold 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:59.150
 of the segment losing only to the hr b of 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:02.239
 now round his great rival despite the 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:03.050
 Echo Strength Sport Dance and What Helps 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:05.420
 well this 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:07.670
 within the quality package is the 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:10.520
 strategy to offer a wide range of 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:15.460
 versions with two engines and three 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:15.460
 transmissions between manual and automatic 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:26.750
 therefore the importance of this version 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:29.270
 1.8-liter engine already known from other 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:31.729
 fata models and which allows a cost 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:34.190
 more accessible for those who do not yet have 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:35.300
 conditions to assume the top versions with 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:38.090
 diesel engine 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:41.780
 here comes the basic question the already known 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:44.810
 1.8 e.torq engine gives the message here 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:47.810
 Yes, he solves it because to this 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:49.880
 renegade this 1.8 engine received some 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:52.250
 hits some improvements 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:55.220
 now the important thing here is you observe 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:57.470
 that the use of this version with engine 1.8 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:59.690
 flex has to be different here 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:01.819
 The proposal is that you 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:04.490
 car in the most routine situations of the 

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:06.530
 day by day even on the road with the family 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:10.390
 but nothing to expect from them 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.390
 very strict answers 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:23.630
 furthermore, here is an issue that 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.730
 renegade must be considered. 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.260
 both heavy in this version with 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:31.670
 automatic transmission 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:34.430
 weighs 430 kilos and a 1.8 engine feels 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:36.590
 in the retakes and in this version the situation 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:38.840
 bothers you because the automatic transmission 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:41.600
 which is thus more a refinement of the car 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:43.900
 works in favor of reducing consumption 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:46.670
 with exchanges made with little agility 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:50.440
 always exploring the ideal rotations 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:50.440
 for each gear change 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:02.069
 in practice the truth is that renegade 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:03.959
 can be a good utility 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:06.900
 when you need to face those roads 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:09.120
 more ill-treated or even stretches of 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.099
 land a little more radical 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.680
 now it's also true that you 

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:16.410
 takes this version very well especially 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.670
 here on the tarmac tracks 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:20.220
 well treated 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:22.829
 the king of walks very safe but very 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:25.530
 comfortable and great insulation 

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:27.660
 and then I call your attention to another 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:30.450
 outstanding characteristic of the rescue 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:33.540
 which is the good finish present in all 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:36.269
 the versions and special care with the 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:39.890
 identity and jeep present in many 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:39.890
 here inside the rescue 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:45.900
 add to that also questionable content 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:48.239
 safety and comfort 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:49.970
 since the first version brings direction with 

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:52.430
 electric assistance air conditioning 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:55.500
 sound system with six speakers 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:57.870
 bluetooth and auxiliary brake inputs 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:00.359
 electric parking sensor 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:02.970
 back parking computer 

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:05.549
 board and traction control and in this 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:08.340
 longitude version to letters for exchanges 

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:10.709
 steering wheel manuals without button 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:13.769
 key and multimedia system with screen 

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:17.780
 five inch navigator and rear camera 

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:17.780
 are good examples of serial items 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:39.300
 and this contact with the jeep I reneged 

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:41.730
 now with this version with flex motor 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:44.639
 the proposal offered is clear to me 

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:46.260
 for this compact crossover beyond all 

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:48.990
 the delivery of equipment is very 

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:50.550
 here is the offer of sensations that 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:52.889
 It has everything to do with personality 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:56.450
 Egyptians if this is important to you 

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:56.450
 You'll like the car, yes.
