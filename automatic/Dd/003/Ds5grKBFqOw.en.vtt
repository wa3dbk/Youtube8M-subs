00:00:13.524 --> 00:00:15.277
 SOMEWHERE, IN ANY NEIGHBORHOOD 

00:00:17.036 --> 00:00:18.636
 THERE IS SOMEBODY 

00:00:21.868 --> 00:00:23.433
 WHAT WE CAN NOT FORGOT 

00:00:25.081 --> 00:00:25.981
 Do you have a girlfriend? 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.580
 Is her name Emma Emma? 

00:00:29.683 --> 00:00:31.288
 You finally arrived! 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.277
 How long have you been together? 

00:00:33.526 --> 00:00:34.991
 I would say that ever since, sir 

00:00:35.191 --> 00:00:36.678
 From the same producer of "Walk the Line" 

00:00:37.434 --> 00:00:40.813
 We were in the same school until the age of 10, then I moved 

00:00:41.688 --> 00:00:42.835
 Did not need to come 

00:00:42.836 --> 00:00:44.719
 I really wanted to come 

00:00:45.281 --> 00:00:47.299
 Emma? It's Will. 

00:00:47.171 --> 00:00:49.939
 Seriously? Hi 

00:00:50.555 --> 00:00:51.136
 SOMEWHERE IN THE WHOLE HEART 

00:00:51.137 --> 00:00:52.137
 It's been so long 

00:00:52.273 --> 00:00:54.224
 Look at me, look at us 

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:55.948
 You look beautiful 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.246
 THERE IS A WAY TO RETURN 

00:00:57.247 --> 00:01:00.966
 And in my dreams I breathe it 

00:01:01.795 --> 00:01:06.315
 You talk like following this girl makes sense, but it does not! 

00:01:06.845 --> 00:01:08.092
 Want to go somewhere? 

00:01:08.093 --> 00:01:09.519
 I have to find a person 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:10.604
 A friend? 

00:01:10.855 --> 00:01:12.092
 He wants to marry me. 

00:01:12.651 --> 00:01:14.923
 And because a step contrary to you 

00:01:14.958 --> 00:01:17.726
 seems a step in the wrong direction? 

00:01:17.727 --> 00:01:20.010
 The world does not work that way! 

00:01:20.011 --> 00:01:23.080
 You have to stop it, we're not kids anymore! 

00:01:23.081 --> 00:01:25.614
 HOW LONG WERE YOU WAITING FOR? 

00:01:48.751 --> 00:01:51.422
 I need to say something to you a long time ago. 

00:01:51.648 --> 00:01:54.847
 I wait for you forever
