00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
 Hello everyone, I 'll show you how to make a league 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:05.970
 catapult 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:08.639
 we need this detail of it and 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:11.780
 we put just such a design is 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:13.920
 two of them are wrong 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:16.830
 on the side we put 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:20.880
 bypasses the side we put this 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:23.359
 design such it is such another 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.160
 the same structure we put in here 

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:28.949
 God leave the same thing once 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:32.219
 it happens like this again we 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.520
 we disconnect we put and then and so 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.950
 here 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.320
 in the middle then we take the same part 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.360
 We put there just such a detail. 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:44.270
 then he does the rain 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:47.760
 The concept of the advice of two plates 1 on 4 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:52.350
 there we connect them with and we get 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:55.230
 Here we are 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:59.930
 take one such gum of any size 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:03.449
 and on the sides here in this hole 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:08.060
 We put here are these parts of milk and we 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:08.060
 it happens like this 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:16.680
 then we connect in this way 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:20.490
 gum still we 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:29.060
 Evenki there put such ringing crumbs 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:34.740
 and so we connect stretch 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:39.409
 We're dragging on like this Chinese 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:44.009
 and back to god so fly away already 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:46.610
 done and that's how it turns out 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.610
 here 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:59.490
 and we will need such a check 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:07.640
 put her 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:11.990
 here is a court very strong it is reliable 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:14.400
 shoot well on a good stash included 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:23.480
 then we should have taken in such 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:26.670
 different fly as it were, and so close 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:30.030
 how to include such tales 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:32.670
 built a catapult will show him how 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:43.430
 she will immediately shoot here 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:46.890
 such as here for example our necks now 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:49.350
 had to get into it to keep 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:51.110
 her that way and let go and she is sharp 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:55.280
 shakes very sharply 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:03:00.360
 very peking even very 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:03.600
 such a view can be put here measures 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:05.090
 something here and so I also Circuits 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:09.600
 set 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:15.560
 show should have kept and psychologists and 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:15.560
 letting go slowly slowly start and 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:30.590
 shoot everyone where to develop and and again 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:33.850
 what is with the charge and here it is let 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:37.170
 thanks for watching the likes 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:37.170
 played bye bye
