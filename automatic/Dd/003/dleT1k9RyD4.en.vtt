00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:06.690
 Hey, I think so now 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.179
 again about how to deal with a map 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.620
 with ThÃ¼rauf gets've ever 1 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.019
 This is now three or four 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.809
 years online has about 30 thousand 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.310
 Clicks or something is the same door as 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.760
 I moved there then 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:26.460
 same procedure in advance for you geneva 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:27.990
 or home with no other so if 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.429
 you sometime colleague side has become 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.579
 Locked out we said again 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:35.489
 forget the key then okay but 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:38.309
 otherwise it is that to do with strangers 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.690
 without their permission illegal and also 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.100
 if you have the permission then i will 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.230
 always careful because it always people 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.570
 who could see each other then 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.070
 Oh, that's what it was 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.780
 I suppose if something happens somewhere 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.460
 gets lost and shows how must 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.820
 After all, people are finally laying it down 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.020
 Somehow I opened your clock somewhere 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.610
 the cabinet the world behind the cupboard 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:00.140
 and after a few years, then comes out 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:03.090
 where you expected in march he stole 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.780
 yes you have not been in with loud 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.610
 Germany liked 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.290
 So do not show it so openly that you 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.030
 I can show doors with cards 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.790
 but now for a short time 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.880
 description how it works in advance 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:18.840
 ye doors are just rubber seal so 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.369
 as you can see here you have this 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.750
 first with any knife or 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.340
 remove similar I have here now 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.689
 at my front door it already tried 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.740
 but to do that is a bit 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.110
 bigger a bit older 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:31.979
 Often, these are also the benefits 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.000
 wooden strips but the style here only 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.979
 a little further 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.140
 they would also have to come off otherwise 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.420
 not behind it you can of course 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.920
 then in the thick welded sheet 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.630
 try paper or something similar 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.549
 you can work that too if you 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.079
 says I do not have a card right now 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.729
 But I have a pocket knife in the 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:50.130
 bag what I always have with you because you 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.490
 can only recommend you can from one 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.720
 paper from the plastic container the 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:57.060
 bottles of pet bottles take the 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.740
 cut up when I'm bendable and 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.570
 could use the cards as replacement 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.520
 can use tin cans where not 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.390
 work so well 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.340
 All in all 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.020
 but i think every import my card 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.270
 and I'm just such a candidate 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.679
 always forget his key and 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:14.040
 always right outside the door merkel 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:27.750
 That's why I have to 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:32.370
 map and show you how I am 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:34.470
 have kernchen lie if I had 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:37.590
 do not forget a key let's go 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:39.300
 to the door here I have the rubber seal 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.610
 Beginning away with me as I said 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:45.450
 I also need to be porous 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:48.390
 my touch as when it works 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:51.390
 easy in the map everywhere 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:55.890
 score start with the first peak 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:59.280
 and then the rest after lace first 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:01.910
 after then pull down the door 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:04.739
 to shake a bit to yourself 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:06.209
 because often then function better 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:08.870
 does we want to try to do that? 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:08.870
 send one straight 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:30.480
 you see in the end gave you is quite 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:33.330
 just done it 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:41.290
 you have pushed the card forward here 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:43.420
 and so here this printer easy 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:46.260
 just pushed in 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:51.640
 so that was the donation back here 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:54.790
 The castle festival hangs virtually useless 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:58.150
 and you have opened the door 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:04:00.730
 is relatively simple but requires one 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:02.530
 So do not exercise so much on the 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:05.709
 card press I was young with matthias 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:08.319
 but really so sideward pack if 

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:11.290
 her so often pushes from above break 

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:13.360
 to the left or right just away i 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:17.799
 Hope you saw a card 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:22.120
 I'm back in it 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:27.900
 As proof I would have keyed me 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:27.900
 that means I'm one of the most courageous 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:35.050
 I can do it anytime, always because 

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:36.520
 I've done it 245 times does not work 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:37.780
 at each tour at first attempt is a 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:39.630
 little exercise thing a bit 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:42.430
 fumble but I think in the long run 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:44.820
 Everyone would be fine, thank you 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:44.820
 for watching
