00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:44.959 
space of a tenth here so that I can

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:48.069 
space of a tenth here so that I can
reach<00:02:45.260> this<00:02:46.130> chord<00:02:47.000> on<00:02:47.239> the<00:02:47.269> after<00:02:47.690> beat<00:02:47.900> and

as<00:03:34.210> opposed<00:03:34.960> to<00:03:35.470> ragtime<00:03:36.190> and<00:03:36.250> I<00:03:36.490> think<00:03:36.730> we'll

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:36.910 
as opposed to ragtime and I think we'll

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:38.880 
as opposed to ragtime and I think we'll
get<00:03:37.060> into<00:03:37.270> the<00:03:37.540> rec<00:03:37.900> time<00:03:38.140> versus<00:03:38.620> thrive

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:38.890
