00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.929
 arbitration controversy 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.660
 stories of rigorous doubts granted to 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.910
 opponents and their own denied so much from

 I don't want to hear about Latin anymore 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.410
 brought because a thing we close 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.450
 I think about growing my team though 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.070
 when they try to create this 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:39.469
 situation around soccer mi 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:41.520
 it really looks like you need to get bored 

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:43.379
 at the entrance to the field and latina does the 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.629
 cheering for the former benevento technician 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.460
 carmelo imbriani friend of pecchia yes 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.129

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.500
 matches against cold disease 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.270

 host fans who have the ninth can 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.969
 exult 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.780
 the naive entrance and falls are a 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.609
 all one 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.589
 the pile of dry if there would be for 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.750
 the referee but not seen

 conditioning from the whistle trip 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:14.700
 the clear Nerazzurri reaction passes 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.890
 for the jargon cue at the 23rd to the

 punishment that kicks power on the pole 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.760
 goalkeeper not blameless 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:29.460
 the public pushes Latin to the 27th 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:31.410
 jefferson tower for cola rescue 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.630
 of the defense followed by the 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:35.900
 carambola that leads to the most comical 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.130
 of the needle networks is only optical illusion 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:41.040
 clear instead appears when

 remedies two yellow cards in two 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.869
 minutes the time ends with 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:06.960
 yet another controversy for a possible 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:08.910
 hands in the penalty area bell but yes 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.009
 he also protests from the other side 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:14.310
 at the second minute of the recovery must 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:16.560
 remove the pitino and latina ds test 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:19.590
 to enter from the bands to the fifth

 screwing of a balloon on the bottom 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.430
 at the ninth cross from the left reaching 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.530
 diagonal sacilotto of first intention 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.780
 diverted into a corner 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:30.900
 other solutions outside jefferson al

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.760
 milani per gerbo turned at the near post 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:37.920
 Russian there is great risk to the 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:40.050
 seventeenth the evacuated lob 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.540
 and out of size but bindi remits us that 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:45.360
 at the 24th he will be forced to make space 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.220
 to the oems and to the debut in the championship 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.739
 in the meantime about concierges 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:52.769
 Russian effortlessly lifts over the crossbar and the 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:54.720
 the same 31 barraco torpedo 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:56.940
 baracco off on a cross by milani 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.590
 still nothing to do 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:00.780
 old thinks again and with tulli e 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:03.630
 the thirty-ninth network re-proposes 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:06.049
 expelled lost tina team manager 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:09.150
 in the final minutes, great emotions 

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:11.820
 Garufo at 42nd creates panic in the area 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:13.739
 penalty at the 47th punishment 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:16.320
 of corapi the oems and smanaccia on the feet 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:18.120
 of scardina that shoots up 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:20.070
 at the 48th acceleration 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:22.520
 abruzzo to the marker only needs to 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:25.490
 put it in the center but it loses 

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:27.530
 the balance in the sixth minute of recovery 

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:30.260
 minelli di varese says it can be enough 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:33.310
 authors instead start another game in 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:36.950
 press room we lost two points 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:38.270
 according to me yes because the game 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:41.540
 we had prepared it well but we were 

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:43.450
 playing well then having passed into 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:45.620
 benefit 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:47.180
 I think there was a direction of 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:49.190
 race as unilateral I said also in 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:52.070
 unilateral television including the 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:55.910
 punishment of the goal that non-existent a 

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:58.520
 set of evaluations and then we are 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:04:01.430
 remaining in ten it seems to be reviewed 

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:02.840
 also the situation of the two 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:04.040
 giuliatto's warnings in five 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:05.180
 minutes are situations they have 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:07.850
 conditioned the game 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:12.380
 I'm satisfied because we have 

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:13.700
 played soccer always and even when 

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:15.590
 we went under had one 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:21.230
 great reaction from a large group 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:23.600
 the real team is made to rejoice 

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:25.280
 who arrived at the end of the race way 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:27.320
 the demonstration they have is out of proportion 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:29.570
 escaped a danger 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:31.070
 I look look ahead and look at 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:33.500
 what happens at home two points 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:36.920
 throw away not even one point earned 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:38.420
 I sure wanted to see them as they were 

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:41.270
 setting the race with superiority 

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:43.220
 numerical and everything if you want to hope for 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:44.960
 a little more, but it's okay 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:46.869
 same because we did a very good one 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:50.020
 performance 

00:04:46.869 --> 00:04:52.189
 nothing we have to go on like this 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:55.879
 time we were a little too much 

00:04:52.189 --> 00:04:58.789
 hasty made that of being one in 

00:04:55.879 --> 00:05:01.550
 the more he took us he pushed us anyway 

00:04:58.789 --> 00:05:02.779
 to play too fast to look 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:04.939
 immediately the way of scoring 

00:05:02.779 --> 00:05:07.929
 when instead we have a little more patience 

00:05:04.939 --> 00:05:13.509
 and make it turn more even because 

00:05:07.929 --> 00:05:13.509
 according to me they would never have taken
