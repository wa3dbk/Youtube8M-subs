00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.700 
is just a total wreck Vanetta is a
budget<00:01:15.210> title<00:01:15.540> and<00:01:15.689> in<00:01:16.140> terms<00:01:16.409> of<00:01:16.560> its

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
budget title and in terms of its

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.370 
budget title and in terms of its
production<00:01:16.950> value<00:01:17.670> it<00:01:18.060> definitely<00:01:18.900> lives<00:01:19.170> up

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
production value it definitely lives up

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:20.030 
production value it definitely lives up
to<00:01:19.409> the<00:01:19.650> billing

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
to the billing

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.429 
to the billing
but<00:01:20.670> the<00:01:20.820> great<00:01:21.119> thing<00:01:21.150> about<00:01:21.479> video<00:01:21.960> games<00:01:22.259> is

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
but the great thing about video games is

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.350 
but the great thing about video games is
that<00:01:22.470> you<00:01:22.710> can<00:01:22.860> overlook<00:01:23.280> stuff<00:01:23.490> like<00:01:23.880> that<00:01:24.090> if

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
that you can overlook stuff like that if

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.530 
that you can overlook stuff like that if
the<00:01:24.840> game<00:01:25.080> is<00:01:25.290> good<00:01:25.560> even<00:01:26.159> edica<00:01:26.549> is<00:01:26.790> anything

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540
