we're really excited about it i'll start

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.320 
we're really excited about it i'll start
with<00:00:13.679> the<00:00:13.799> hardware<00:00:14.070> and<00:00:14.670> then<00:00:14.790> transition

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
with the hardware and then transition

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:16.760 
with the hardware and then transition
over<00:00:15.540> to<00:00:15.570> some<00:00:16.139> of<00:00:16.199> the<00:00:16.260> neat<00:00:16.379> things<00:00:16.410> in<00:00:16.680> the

over to some of the neat things in the

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.710 
over to some of the neat things in the
software<00:00:17.160> so<00:00:17.609> on<00:00:17.699> the<00:00:17.789> hardware<00:00:18.119> itself<00:00:18.300> the

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
software so on the hardware itself the

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:19.640 
software so on the hardware itself the
one<00:00:18.900> thing<00:00:19.080> that<00:00:19.109> you're<00:00:19.320> going<00:00:19.439> to<00:00:19.500> notice

one thing that you're going to notice

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.470 
one thing that you're going to notice
right<00:00:19.949> off<00:00:20.010> the<00:00:20.250> bat<00:00:20.430> is<00:00:20.910> the<00:00:21.090> fact<00:00:21.300> that<00:00:21.359> the

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
right off the bat is the fact that the

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.540 
right off the bat is the fact that the
keypad<00:00:21.900> is<00:00:22.080> huge<00:00:22.320> you<00:00:22.769> actually<00:00:22.920> get<00:00:23.220> four

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
keypad is huge you actually get four

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.820 
keypad is huge you actually get four
rows<00:00:24.210> of<00:00:24.480> buttons<00:00:24.660> and<00:00:24.960> two<00:00:25.019> keypad<00:00:25.350> very<00:00:25.619> well

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
rows of buttons and two keypad very well

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.820 
rows of buttons and two keypad very well
spaced<00:00:26.390> where<00:00:27.390> a<00:00:27.420> keypad<00:00:27.840> very<00:00:28.170> effective<00:00:28.619> as

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
spaced where a keypad very effective as

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.009 
spaced where a keypad very effective as
well<00:00:29.010> in<00:00:29.130> your<00:00:29.250> hand<00:00:29.519> so<00:00:30.090> the<00:00:30.599> reason<00:00:30.900> we're

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
well in your hand so the reason we're

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:32.630 
well in your hand so the reason we're
able<00:00:31.050> to<00:00:31.260> provide<00:00:31.320> that<00:00:31.740> for<00:00:32.009> roses<00:00:32.489> because

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
able to provide that for roses because

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.110 
able to provide that for roses because
of<00:00:32.910> a<00:00:32.969> unique<00:00:33.270> engine<00:00:33.870> see<00:00:34.200> it<00:00:34.670> the<00:00:35.670> opposite

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
of a unique engine see it the opposite

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.729 
of a unique engine see it the opposite
way<00:00:36.180> that<00:00:36.540> give<00:00:36.690> backflips<00:00:37.260> if<00:00:37.440> you<00:00:37.559> will

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
way that give backflips if you will

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.369 
way that give backflips if you will
compared<00:00:38.550> to<00:00:38.579> what<00:00:38.760> a<00:00:39.059> lot<00:00:39.210> of<00:00:39.390> devices<00:00:39.899> do<00:00:40.079> and

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
compared to what a lot of devices do and

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.590 
compared to what a lot of devices do and
that<00:00:40.739> gives<00:00:40.950> us<00:00:41.129> extra<00:00:41.489> room<00:00:41.730> because<00:00:42.210> of<00:00:42.329> how

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
that gives us extra room because of how

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.590 
that gives us extra room because of how
we've<00:00:42.780> designed<00:00:42.960> that<00:00:43.320> in<00:00:43.559> John<00:00:43.770> that<00:00:43.890> twice

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:44.600 
we've designed that in John that twice

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.970 
we've designed that in John that twice
on<00:00:45.600> the<00:00:45.690> back<00:00:45.899> of<00:00:46.110> the<00:00:46.170> device<00:00:46.320> they're

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
on the back of the device they're

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.590 
on the back of the device they're
actually<00:00:47.280> going<00:00:47.399> to<00:00:47.489> see<00:00:47.670> right<00:00:47.940> up<00:00:48.270> here

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
actually going to see right up here

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.540 
actually going to see right up here
rectangle<00:00:49.590> and<00:00:49.680> that's<00:00:49.860> actually<00:00:50.010> like<00:00:50.370> on<00:00:50.520> a

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
rectangle and that's actually like on a

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.639 
rectangle and that's actually like on a
notebook<00:00:50.789> computer<00:00:51.329> so<00:00:51.570> that's<00:00:51.809> so<00:00:52.410> you<00:00:52.500> can

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
notebook computer so that's so you can

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.799 
notebook computer so that's so you can
see<00:00:52.800> right<00:00:52.829> there<00:00:53.190> that's<00:00:53.399> the<00:00:53.809> backtrack

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
see right there that's the backtrack

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.540 
see right there that's the backtrack
keypad<00:00:55.230> on<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.500> back<00:00:55.649> of<00:00:55.680> the<00:00:55.890> device<00:00:55.980> or<00:00:56.430> it's

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
keypad on the back of the device or it's

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.580 
keypad on the back of the device or it's
hard<00:00:56.760> to<00:00:56.910> see<00:00:57.120> okay<00:00:57.870> just<00:00:58.199> look<00:00:58.289> at<00:00:58.410> it<00:00:58.469> right

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
hard to see okay just look at it right

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.069 
hard to see okay just look at it right
now<00:00:58.620> there<00:00:59.250> you<00:00:59.430> go<00:00:59.579> at<00:01:00.270> the<00:01:00.390> right<00:01:00.420> and<00:01:00.930> you

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
now there you go at the right and you

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.900 
now there you go at the right and you
can<00:01:01.199> see<00:01:01.289> it's<00:01:01.410> a<00:01:01.469> rectangle<00:01:01.980> very<00:01:02.489> effective

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
can see it's a rectangle very effective

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.670 
can see it's a rectangle very effective
and<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.090> reason<00:01:03.359> it's<00:01:03.510> need<00:01:03.690> is<00:01:03.809> as<00:01:04.320> you<00:01:04.470> hold

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
and the reason it's need is as you hold

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.350 
and the reason it's need is as you hold
the<00:01:04.890> device<00:01:05.040> in<00:01:05.369> your<00:01:05.400> hand<00:01:05.729> your<00:01:05.970> index

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
the device in your hand your index

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.539 
the device in your hand your index
finger<00:01:06.659> will<00:01:06.840> naturally<00:01:06.990> go<00:01:07.320> to<00:01:08.010> that<00:01:08.159> spot

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
finger will naturally go to that spot

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.640 
finger will naturally go to that spot
and<00:01:08.790> it<00:01:09.150> really<00:01:09.570> makes<00:01:09.780> it<00:01:09.900> easy<00:01:10.080> in<00:01:10.290> terms<00:01:10.500> of

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
and it really makes it easy in terms of

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.530 
and it really makes it easy in terms of
scrolling<00:01:10.979> around<00:01:11.159> websites<00:01:11.729> or<00:01:11.939> scrolling

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
scrolling around websites or scrolling

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.469 
scrolling around websites or scrolling
around<00:01:12.720> your<00:01:12.990> menus<00:01:13.290> and<00:01:13.470> your<00:01:13.590> device<00:01:14.479> so

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
around your menus and your device so

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.530 
around your menus and your device so
that's<00:01:15.659> backtrack<00:01:16.340> and<00:01:17.340> as<00:01:17.580> well<00:01:17.820> we've<00:01:18.240> got<00:01:18.509> a

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
that's backtrack and as well we've got a

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.570 
that's backtrack and as well we've got a
great<00:01:18.810> little<00:01:19.020> of<00:01:19.380> what<00:01:19.710> we<00:01:19.860> call<00:01:20.009> a<00:01:20.070> desktop

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
great little of what we call a desktop

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.609 
great little of what we call a desktop
mode<00:01:20.820> and<00:01:21.090> just<00:01:21.330> device<00:01:21.630> momentarily<00:01:22.200> it

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
mode and just device momentarily it

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.260 
mode and just device momentarily it
should<00:01:22.890> jump<00:01:23.130> to<00:01:23.340> the<00:01:23.549> alarm<00:01:23.729> clock<00:01:23.939> mode

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
should jump to the alarm clock mode

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.030 
should jump to the alarm clock mode
there<00:01:24.420> goes<00:01:24.659> so<00:01:25.140> it<00:01:25.229> shows<00:01:25.409> you<00:01:25.560> your<00:01:25.710> clock

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
there goes so it shows you your clock

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.270 
there goes so it shows you your clock
and<00:01:26.520> it<00:01:27.119> gives<00:01:27.299> you<00:01:27.390> the<00:01:27.509> ability<00:01:27.570> to<00:01:28.020> do<00:01:28.229> your
