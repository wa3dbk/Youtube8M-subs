00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.700

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.740
 smooth smooth without frizz 

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:24.490
 but it will hold perfect even in 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:24.490
 human environments 

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:31.060
 and the first thing I've done is apply a 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:32.529
 heat protector this is in a 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.480
 mask that act only three 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:37.020
 minutes like this will protect our hair from 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:39.930
 heat of the iron 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:42.350
 when I am 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.610
 let's start making sections 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:45.900
 we make more or less sections according to the 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.140
 thickness and abundance of our 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:48.140
 hair 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:52.410
 Wavelet now with this application 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:56.930
 flexible let's take a method 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.930
 we shake and spray over it 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.070
 we slide the lock by our hands 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.870
 to distribute the lacquer and flexible and 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.170
 Next we grilled by the 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.170
 meson 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.840
 we are taking strands and repeating 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.840
 This space 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:43.110
 the verse 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.960

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.960
 and a lot 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:54.040
 we lower authorization and we repeat 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:09.560
 so to finish with all the hair 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:12.099
 I want 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.099

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:27.689
 what 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.609
 what thing like me you grow up hairs 

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:31.200
 and they go a little on their own makes this step 

00:02:29.609 --> 00:02:32.319
 Take the lacquer again and put it on the 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.999
 fingers 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:36.450
 and they pass the cornet in the hairs 

00:02:33.999 --> 00:02:36.450
 loose 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.739
 we comb the top part and we go to 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:44.879
 repeat with the short hairs that 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:44.879
