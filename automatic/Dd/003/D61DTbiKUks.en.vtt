guess<00:00:32.230> there's<00:00:32.680> a<00:00:32.800> lot<00:00:32.950> of<00:00:33.190> engine<00:00:34.030> builders

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:34.360 
guess there's a lot of engine builders

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:35.880 
guess there's a lot of engine builders
that<00:00:34.390> are<00:00:34.600> like<00:00:34.840> oh<00:00:35.020> you<00:00:35.620> know<00:00:35.710> I've<00:00:35.860> been

that are like oh you know I've been

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:37.200 
that are like oh you know I've been
doing<00:00:36.160> this<00:00:36.250> for<00:00:36.460> years<00:00:36.579> and<00:00:36.730> I<00:00:36.850> know<00:00:36.910> that

doing this for years and I know that

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:39.210 
doing this for years and I know that
ring<00:00:37.390> gap<00:00:37.600> I<00:00:37.870> know<00:00:38.290> what<00:00:38.500> I<00:00:38.530> should<00:00:38.740> do<00:00:38.860> this<00:00:39.040> is

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:39.220 
ring gap I know what I should do this is

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:42.080 
ring gap I know what I should do this is
a<00:00:39.250> boosted<00:00:39.730> sand<00:00:40.030> rail<00:00:40.270> engine<00:00:40.630> it's<00:00:40.810> an<00:00:40.900> ls3

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
a boosted sand rail engine it's an ls3

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.400 
a boosted sand rail engine it's an ls3
we<00:00:43.090> have<00:00:43.210> a<00:00:43.239> stroker<00:00:43.660> kit

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:44.410 
we have a stroker kit

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:48.240 
we have a stroker kit
it's<00:00:45.010> bored-out<00:00:46.980> 5000's<00:00:47.980> because<00:00:48.130> the

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:48.250 
it's bored-out 5000's because the

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:50.760 
it's bored-out 5000's because the
pistons<00:00:48.610> come<00:00:48.820> standard<00:00:49.510> then<00:00:50.230> you<00:00:50.410> out<00:00:50.560> the

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:50.770 
pistons come standard then you out the

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:53.280 
pistons come standard then you out the
Pistons<00:00:51.100> are<00:00:51.190> always<00:00:51.460> +5<00:00:52.000> so<00:00:52.480> you<00:00:52.540> got<00:00:53.020> to<00:00:53.140> hone

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:53.290 
Pistons are always +5 so you got to hone

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:55.590 
Pistons are always +5 so you got to hone
it<00:00:53.440> in<00:00:53.590> to<00:00:54.310> the<00:00:54.430> piston<00:00:54.760> size<00:00:54.940> then<00:00:55.360> you<00:00:55.450> call

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:55.600 
it in to the piston size then you call

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.139 
it in to the piston size then you call
the<00:00:55.720> piston<00:00:56.020> manufacturer<00:00:56.680> you<00:00:57.489> get<00:00:57.730> you<00:00:58.030> know

00:00:58.139 --> 00:00:58.149 
the piston manufacturer you get you know

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:00.090 
the piston manufacturer you get you know
what<00:00:58.720> gap<00:00:58.930> they<00:00:59.290> want<00:00:59.530> on<00:00:59.620> the<00:00:59.680> Rings<00:00:59.890> for

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:00.100 
what gap they want on the Rings for

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.750 
what gap they want on the Rings for
their<00:01:00.430> Pistons<00:01:00.940> so<00:01:01.590> the<00:01:02.590> this<00:01:03.010> specific<00:01:03.550> ring

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:03.760 
their Pistons so the this specific ring

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:06.060 
their Pistons so the this specific ring
gap<00:01:04.000> is<00:01:04.259> twenty-four<00:01:05.259> thousand<00:01:05.680> for<00:01:05.799> the<00:01:05.860> top

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:06.070 
gap is twenty-four thousand for the top

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:08.160 
gap is twenty-four thousand for the top
ring<00:01:06.310> and<00:01:06.520> eighteen<00:01:07.509> thousand<00:01:07.930> for<00:01:08.080> the

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:08.170 
ring and eighteen thousand for the

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:10.140 
ring and eighteen thousand for the
bottom<00:01:08.530> he's<00:01:08.890> running<00:01:09.190> he's<00:01:09.820> running<00:01:09.850> I

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:10.150 
bottom he's running he's running I

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:13.140 
bottom he's running he's running I
believe<00:01:10.390> it's<00:01:10.540> a<00:01:10.570> twin<00:01:10.780> turbo<00:01:10.930> setup<00:01:11.340> so<00:01:12.340> what

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:13.150 
believe it's a twin turbo setup so what

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:15.570 
believe it's a twin turbo setup so what
we<00:01:13.270> do<00:01:13.450> is<00:01:13.720> we<00:01:14.470> get<00:01:14.590> our<00:01:14.710> rings<00:01:14.890> I<00:01:15.190> always<00:01:15.460> do

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:15.580 
we do is we get our rings I always do

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:18.210 
we do is we get our rings I always do
the<00:01:15.700> top<00:01:15.880> first<00:01:16.470> because<00:01:17.470> if<00:01:17.650> you<00:01:17.740> mess<00:01:17.920> up<00:01:17.979> a

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:18.220 
the top first because if you mess up a

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:20.010 
the top first because if you mess up a
little<00:01:18.430> bit<00:01:18.580> on<00:01:18.670> the<00:01:18.760> top<00:01:18.970> ring<00:01:19.240> you're

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:20.020 
little bit on the top ring you're

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:21.570 
little bit on the top ring you're
alright<00:01:20.320> but<00:01:20.380> if<00:01:20.650> you<00:01:20.680> mess<00:01:20.920> up<00:01:20.950> on<00:01:21.250> an<00:01:21.369> oil

alright but if you mess up on an oil

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:23.910 
alright but if you mess up on an oil

go by so what we do is we take can we
put<00:01:27.130> the<00:01:27.220> ring<00:01:27.430> the<00:01:28.090> base<00:01:28.900> of<00:01:29.080> the<00:01:29.140> pizza

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:29.409 
put the ring the base of the pizza

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:33.719 
put the ring the base of the pizza
together<00:01:30.810> okay<00:01:31.810> for<00:01:32.080> the<00:01:32.140> top<00:01:32.320> rings<00:01:32.729> then

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:33.729 
together okay for the top rings then

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:36.090 
together okay for the top rings then
we'll<00:01:33.939> go<00:01:34.090> over<00:01:34.360> to<00:01:34.510> our<00:01:34.540> ring<00:01:35.170> groove<00:01:35.710> machine

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:36.100 
we'll go over to our ring groove machine

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.480 
we'll go over to our ring groove machine
we<00:01:36.729> have<00:01:36.780> we<00:01:37.780> expect<00:01:38.140> the<00:01:38.260> Rings<00:01:38.439> out<00:01:38.619> we<00:01:39.220> found

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:39.490 
we have we expect the Rings out we found

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:42.300 
we have we expect the Rings out we found
out<00:01:39.670> that<00:01:39.820> each<00:01:40.030> one<00:01:40.299> of<00:01:40.390> the<00:01:40.510> Rings<00:01:40.830> is<00:01:41.830> twenty

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:42.310 
out that each one of the Rings is twenty

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:46.499 
out that each one of the Rings is twenty
thousand<00:01:43.409> larger<00:01:44.409> so<00:01:45.159> we<00:01:46.090> need<00:01:46.240> to<00:01:46.330> shave

00:01:46.499 --> 00:01:46.509 
thousand larger so we need to shave

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:47.999 
thousand larger so we need to shave
twenty<00:01:46.810> thousands<00:01:47.200> off<00:01:47.290> to<00:01:47.439> get<00:01:47.560> the<00:01:47.680> zero

00:01:47.999 --> 00:01:48.009 
twenty thousands off to get the zero

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:50.219 
twenty thousands off to get the zero
then<00:01:48.700> we<00:01:48.880> need<00:01:49.030> to<00:01:49.090> go<00:01:49.240> twenty-four<00:01:49.900> to<00:01:50.020> get<00:01:50.110> to

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:50.229 
then we need to go twenty-four to get to

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:52.410 
then we need to go twenty-four to get to
our<00:01:50.320> gap<00:01:50.500> so<00:01:51.400> on<00:01:51.549> the<00:01:51.640> Rings<00:01:51.909> you<00:01:52.090> want<00:01:52.330> to

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:52.420 
our gap so on the Rings you want to

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.429 
our gap so on the Rings you want to
actually<00:01:52.600> make<00:01:52.840> sure<00:01:53.490> that<00:01:54.490> your<00:01:54.640> square

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
actually make sure that your square

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.810 
actually make sure that your square
you'll<00:01:56.439> probably<00:01:56.650> have<00:01:56.890> to<00:01:57.040> reset<00:01:57.430> your<00:01:57.580> tool

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:57.820 
you'll probably have to reset your tool

out of a ring and not even know how far
you're<00:03:50.810> going<00:03:50.890> set<00:03:51.890> it<00:03:51.980> flat<00:03:52.130> we're<00:03:52.850> just

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.000 
you're going set it flat we're just

you're going set it flat we're just
going<00:03:53.120> to<00:03:53.150> bump<00:03:53.330> it

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:01.490 

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:05.740 

that<00:04:02.490> was<00:04:02.640> probably<00:04:03.060> too<00:04:03.330> much<00:04:03.510> to<00:04:04.319> be<00:04:04.440> dead<00:04:04.709> on

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:05.750 
that was probably too much to be dead on

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:08.059 
that was probably too much to be dead on
but<00:04:06.750> we're<00:04:07.530> okay

00:04:08.059 --> 00:04:08.069 
but we're okay

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:12.830 
but we're okay
slide<00:04:08.819> it<00:04:08.940> back<00:04:09.090> in<00:04:10.459> take<00:04:11.459> your<00:04:11.700> piston<00:04:12.150> as

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 
slide it back in take your piston as

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.090 
slide it back in take your piston as
your<00:04:13.020> sliding<00:04:13.380> gauge<00:04:13.530> when<00:04:13.739> you're<00:04:13.830> doing<00:04:14.010> the

piston make sure the oil ring supports

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:18.860 
piston make sure the oil ring supports
on<00:04:16.590> the<00:04:16.680> sides<00:04:16.950> are<00:04:17.450> overlapping<00:04:18.450> a<00:04:18.660> little

on the sides are overlapping a little

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:20.120 
on the sides are overlapping a little
bit<00:04:18.989> so<00:04:19.109> you<00:04:19.200> get<00:04:19.320> it<00:04:19.410> nice<00:04:19.530> and<00:04:19.769> flush<00:04:19.980> in

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.130 
bit so you get it nice and flush in

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:25.190 
bit so you get it nice and flush in
there<00:04:22.040> nice<00:04:23.040> and<00:04:23.280> flush<00:04:23.550> okay<00:04:24.180> if<00:04:24.780> you<00:04:24.870> notice

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:25.200 
there nice and flush okay if you notice

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:28.520 
there nice and flush okay if you notice
that's<00:04:25.380> real<00:04:25.889> close<00:04:26.250> to<00:04:26.520> dead<00:04:26.930> dead<00:04:27.930> on<00:04:28.110> it's

that's real close to dead dead on it's

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:30.680 
that's real close to dead dead on it's
real<00:04:28.770> close<00:04:28.950> to<00:04:29.100> touching<00:04:29.250> each<00:04:29.520> other<00:04:29.730> okay

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:30.690 
real close to touching each other okay

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:34.760 
real close to touching each other okay
we<00:04:31.050> have<00:04:31.169> probably<00:04:31.710> zero<00:04:33.470> point<00:04:34.470> zero<00:04:34.530> zero

we have probably zero point zero zero

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:36.620 
we have probably zero point zero zero
two<00:04:35.130> zero<00:04:35.610> point<00:04:35.820> zero<00:04:35.880> zero<00:04:36.150> three<00:04:36.210> in<00:04:36.510> there

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:36.630 
two zero point zero zero three in there

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:38.480 
two zero point zero zero three in there
so<00:04:37.350> now<00:04:37.470> we<00:04:37.530> know<00:04:37.770> we're<00:04:37.950> real<00:04:38.100> close<00:04:38.220> to<00:04:38.400> where

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:38.490 
so now we know we're real close to where

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:40.970 
so now we know we're real close to where
we<00:04:38.580> need<00:04:38.730> to<00:04:38.820> be<00:04:39.410> so<00:04:40.410> we're<00:04:40.530> going<00:04:40.620> to<00:04:40.680> take<00:04:40.800> our

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:40.980 
we need to be so we're going to take our

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:44.570 
we need to be so we're going to take our
ring<00:04:41.480> now<00:04:42.480> this<00:04:42.660> is<00:04:42.810> the<00:04:42.930> crucial<00:04:43.110> set<00:04:43.580> the

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:44.580 
ring now this is the crucial set the

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:45.920 
ring now this is the crucial set the
first<00:04:44.820> one<00:04:45.000> wants<00:04:45.240> to<00:04:45.270> get<00:04:45.419> it<00:04:45.510> closed<00:04:45.690> if<00:04:45.870> you

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:45.930 
first one wants to get it closed if you

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:48.050 
first one wants to get it closed if you
go<00:04:46.080> a<00:04:46.110> touch<00:04:46.350> over<00:04:46.650> it's<00:04:46.770> fine<00:04:46.979> we<00:04:47.790> get<00:04:47.940> our

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:48.060 
go a touch over it's fine we get our

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:54.370 
go a touch over it's fine we get our
ring<00:04:49.310> set<00:04:50.310> it<00:04:50.430> back<00:04:50.550> up<00:04:50.610> flat<00:04:52.700> that<00:04:53.700> was<00:04:53.880> enough

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:54.380 
ring set it back up flat that was enough

00:04:54.380 --> 00:05:00.310 
ring set it back up flat that was enough
it's<00:04:55.380> crucial<00:04:55.800> to<00:04:55.830> get<00:04:55.979> it<00:04:56.130> flat<00:04:58.190> there<00:04:59.190> we<00:04:59.310> go
