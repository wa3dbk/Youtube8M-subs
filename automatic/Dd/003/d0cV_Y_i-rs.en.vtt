the brain technology in the rear shock

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:13.580 
the brain technology in the rear shock
and<00:01:11.310> also<00:01:11.670> in<00:01:11.820> the<00:01:11.909> fore<00:01:12.149> so<00:01:12.960> you<00:01:13.049> can<00:01:13.170> dial<00:01:13.380> in

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
and also in the fore so you can dial in

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.580 
and also in the fore so you can dial in
the<00:01:13.710> sensitivity<00:01:14.070> of<00:01:14.970> the<00:01:15.869> suspension<00:01:16.439> like

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
came from the road bikes last year went

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:10.699 
came from the road bikes last year went
onto<00:02:09.269> the<00:02:09.450> epics<00:02:09.840> and<00:02:09.959> have<00:02:10.110> now<00:02:10.259> trickled

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
onto the epics and have now trickled

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.220 
onto the epics and have now trickled
down<00:02:10.769> into<00:02:11.329> into<00:02:12.329> the<00:02:12.420> Stumpjumper<00:02:12.750> range

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
down into into the Stumpjumper range

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.500 
down into into the Stumpjumper range
we're<00:02:13.950> running<00:02:14.190> a<00:02:14.280> triple<00:02:14.670> with<00:02:15.060> the<00:02:15.239> SRAM

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
we're running a triple with the SRAM

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.190 
we're running a triple with the SRAM
double<00:02:15.870> axe<00:02:16.880> you<00:02:17.880> may<00:02:18.000> have<00:02:18.090> seen<00:02:18.239> the<00:02:18.930> double

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
double axe you may have seen the double

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.130 
double axe you may have seen the double
axe<00:02:19.350> running<00:02:19.680> a<00:02:19.799> 2<00:02:20.340> by<00:02:20.489> 10<00:02:20.790> but<00:02:21.510> not<00:02:21.750> everybody

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
axe running a 2 by 10 but not everybody

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.710 
axe running a 2 by 10 but not everybody
is<00:02:22.230> a<00:02:22.350> world<00:02:22.829> champion<00:02:23.030> racer<00:02:24.030> so<00:02:24.359> we<00:02:24.540> still

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
is a world champion racer so we still

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.410 
is a world champion racer so we still
have<00:02:24.810> it<00:02:24.930> with<00:02:25.049> a<00:02:25.079> triple<00:02:25.290> it<00:02:25.859> works<00:02:26.130> great<00:02:26.489> if

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
have it with a triple it works great if

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:28.729 
have it with a triple it works great if
you<00:02:27.660> want<00:02:27.840> to<00:02:27.930> you<00:02:28.109> we<00:02:28.350> offer<00:02:28.500> different

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739 
you want to you we offer different

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:30.289 
you want to you we offer different
spiders<00:02:29.340> for<00:02:29.519> the<00:02:29.579> crank<00:02:29.819> so<00:02:30.030> you<00:02:30.090> could

00:02:30.289 --> 00:02:30.299 
spiders for the crank so you could

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:32.860 
spiders for the crank so you could
actually<00:02:30.450> convert<00:02:30.989> it<00:02:31.140> to<00:02:31.170> a<00:02:31.260> 2<00:02:31.440> by<00:02:31.590> 10

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
actually convert it to a 2 by 10

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.740 
actually convert it to a 2 by 10
so<00:02:33.470> this<00:02:33.650> is<00:02:33.769> a<00:02:33.800> very<00:02:34.129> capable<00:02:34.480> trail<00:02:35.480> bike

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
so this is a very capable trail bike

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:37.690 
so this is a very capable trail bike
