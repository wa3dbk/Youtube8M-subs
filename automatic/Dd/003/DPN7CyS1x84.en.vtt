00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
represent my voice one day what I saw

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.310 
represent my voice one day what I saw
the<00:00:42.719> last<00:00:42.930> week<00:00:43.260> was<00:00:44.390> in<00:00:45.390> general<00:00:45.690> that<00:00:46.020> was<00:00:46.170> a

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
the last week was in general that was a

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.420 
the last week was in general that was a
totally<00:00:47.039> rice<00:00:47.340> compared<00:00:48.210> to<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:48.390> last<00:00:48.539> year's

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:49.430 
totally rice compared to the last year's

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:52.340
