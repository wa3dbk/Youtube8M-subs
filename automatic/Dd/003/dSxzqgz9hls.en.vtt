00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:14.330
 hello very good today in this video 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:18.470
 we will make a very easy drawing and 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:20.119
 simple about an owl in a very 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:21.619
 quick and simple 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:25.090
 we'll start by doing the peak 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:25.090
 we would do in the first place 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:36.000
 in this way if that run would go down 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:37.680
 so we would go up and give this curve in 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.520
 the top part will now draw you 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:45.760
 the eyes we will make the first of the eyes 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:49.269
 over here we would do 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:53.219
 well up here and the second that 

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:53.219
 it would be a little bit bigger 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:59.140
 so it would end the same way around here 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.470
 we will talk 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:04.180
 the little dots here 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:08.580
 Y 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:10.540
 curvita by one here and another to 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.390
 we will give 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.100
 in the eyebrows 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.820
 here 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:21.409
 and now we will go with the body shape 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.409
 on this part we would do 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:28.590
 something like that 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:33.260
 for this other 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:35.530
 Arias is now 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:38.640
 we would do 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:38.640
 it would be like this 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:45.200
 in this other until here and now 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:48.829
 up here 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:51.409
 a curvita from one side to the other so now 

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:54.790
 we will draw you 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:59.200
 these little pits on top 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:02:05.009
 and on this side like that 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:05.009
 now we will draw the wings 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:10.149
 of this curve like this and we will make this piquito 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:17.530
 stature view down 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:18.910
 and the latter here in the interior 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:23.020
 area 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:25.740
 it is boring this other smaller and 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:30.240
 the latter so now the other side 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:30.240
 seemed like it would 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:40.250
 of piquito here we would do this other 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:42.190
 well and this curve down in the 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:45.790
 inside we would do 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:49.220
 so another can I here and this last one for 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:54.610
 here now we will draw you 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:58.360
 the legs we would do here 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:03:03.160
 we would go up like this and more or less 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:05.240
 here and on the other side like we will do 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:09.290
 A) Yes 

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:12.670
 and so on and a curvita that would join them 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:16.630
 here now we would do the other fingers 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:20.020
 we would make one here like this 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:24.720
 and another one around here and on the other side 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:28.710
 we'll do one more over here 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:33.030
 and another one more now in each leg we add 

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:36.950
 a series of lines like that 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:36.950
 on this side equal 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:44.120
 and around here like that 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:47.120
 and we would have drawn this owl so 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:49.790
 easy and simple I hope you have 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:53.000
 liked it has been very easy too 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:56.260
 to realize you and we wanted each other in 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.260
 next minis videos
