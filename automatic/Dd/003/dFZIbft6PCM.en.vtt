00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:05.029
 in a stove that commenting today 

00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:07.039
 I bring one is the jicote and good me 

00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:08.480
 was coming t4 finish playing me a few 

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:10.160
 caged in enough life seller 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:11.750
 hackers but I'm going to try 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:13.880
 avoid it as you see someone check 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:15.350
 because the game is coming, it seems that 

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:17.359
 well in a message to the left with what 

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:19.249
 which we see if it is legal the tea and we are going 

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:21.320
 there m-40 welcomes he does not have to go 

00:00:19.249 --> 00:00:22.429
 with the m-40 welcomes to see what is good 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:25.000
 there I am seeing it at all times 

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:28.350
 it's worth it because it does not lead to deadly silence 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.350
 I would do something 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.279
 in this project 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:47.980
 we are also in the time and avoiding 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:49.240
 Normal say that good this Topic 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:50.770
 I had call of duty and many times 

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:51.940
 you expect me to try to make the spa 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:53.440
 ultra can interfere in the 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:55.420
 parental container against them 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.800
 to campear vale us I'll teach it in 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:00.540
 as much as I can as soon as I kill him once and 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.540
 you can hook it well put 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:10.110
 where you were born there at least and 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:13.110
 where are they going to do now 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.110
 and 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:21.020
 we are good we go to top 95 0 and if not 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.020
 I feel the time 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:31.720
 and the pull when this becomes hours 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.000
 and it seems that he was born there but he has not 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.000
 caught well 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:44.810
 here it is better that it is inside more than 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.810
 make space 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:53.190
 i 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:55.880
 and it was without bullets I was also going to 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:55.880
 kill the I believe 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:01.490
 the good I think I 'm immortal I'm 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:03.670
 watching all the time with which I do not 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:07.740
 it is needed later because I know where it is 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:09.300
 and mark in myself 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.500
 we are going to make the last low since we 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.510
 it was that he was once hooked on 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.580
 this country is not like that 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.650
 kids, we already have the first 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:21.110
 beatings match we found some 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:21.110
 give a little more cane and bng right now 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.280
 in controlling martin in loading and os 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.290
 has said before that try to play so 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.940
 minus three in loading so let's 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:32.160
 see what weapon this guy goes with and followed 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:33.780
 deadly silence or not I am going to continue with 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.970
 My account tells me how I'm going to change 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:39.450
 it does not matter what weapon he carries because 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:41.000
 I 'm watching it is still takes it 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:43.010
 deadly selection 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.400
 be a little bit I will not go looking for him 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.400
 notice 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.370
 I believe I do not say deadly silicon 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:51.700
 fear is there changing and the shot failed 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:56.580
 very well 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:58.630
 with a submachine gun the suit of that 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:00.610
 only 5 this has to give a little 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:02.290
 of problems I believe because it's a lot 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:04.090
 better the mp5 than the sniper does not also not 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.350
 I hear you I do not know where it comes from 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:07.560
 which I will have to walk with a lot 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:07.560
 watch out 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:11.060
 or 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:13.440
 he has to be around here I know because he 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:16.430
 it's like keep looking for me 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.430
 all right 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.450
 good, it's my turn to come back, come back 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:24.450
 I want to change my arms 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:27.940
 I'm going to try to make the spam 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.260
 said that you have to put in here 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:30.700
 kill him and he will be born all the time where 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:34.049
 I'm now pointing to the right like this 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:34.049
 that good a little to see if it comes 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.120
 in the head let's see if we hook 

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:52.069
 in the grid and hooked ok let's go 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:53.810
 we go 

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:56.340
 i 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:59.000
 to the head 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:59.000
 block 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:02.870
 my mother yes I won 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:09.060
 so no, but it's very difficult to do it 

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:10.530
 explains you have to play a lot and I 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:13.590
 before that this game was good now 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:16.200
 I am normal and tone without master 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:18.600
 a phrase worth the bastard get low 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:20.239
 of 76 left me very little I will tell a 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:23.739
 little bit 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:23.739
 here in the container 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:28.669
 If that 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:37.160
 of the game good kids then here 

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:39.320
 is the 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:42.040
 the second game we go with the third 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:42.040
 let's go for the last 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:50.689
 and last game does not seem hacker either 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:53.119
 if this guy goes with sneijder is a man 

00:04:50.689 --> 00:04:56.509
 Well, if it goes with m-40, so 

00:04:53.119 --> 00:04:58.519
 quite had the thing is in the 

00:04:56.509 --> 00:05:02.260
 Spanish is that it can play and gives me 

00:04:58.519 --> 00:05:04.510
 this also like me with m-40 co 

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:13.140
 i 

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:17.490
 this guy control a son of a bitch 

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:17.490
 This guy is going to give me a lot of problems 

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:25.110
 Y 

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:25.110
 and here I do not use it to change 

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:32.700
 It is the most complicated but good for 

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:32.700
 concentrate a bit we will see 

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:39.150
 patient 

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:40.470
 of greater also outside I am seeing 

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:42.240
 I take a deep impact to do the 

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:45.449
 which are they going 

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:48.110
 that 's why it 's there it's inside the 

00:05:45.449 --> 00:05:48.110
 content 

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:54.050
 wow girlfriend has more streaks then she sees 

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:54.050
 only then it's not the piggy 

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:03.900
 your head has many more things 

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:03.900
 all right 

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:09.160
 it seemed like measured in the whole head 

00:06:10.249 --> 00:06:13.819
 host this uncle good this control to 

00:06:12.619 --> 00:06:17.289
 this note that his orbits are 

00:06:13.819 --> 00:06:17.289
 here in the east 

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:22.910
 so hooked well 

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:24.860
 and winning for a 

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:28.110
 anguish to tie draw more than the 

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:30.550
 exciting part 

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:32.789
 It highlights to wait a bit the from the 

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:32.789
 permission 

00:06:38.069 --> 00:06:41.460
 and there are 

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:47.180
 at the head kid 

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:51.629
 something like that I do not remember 

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:54.050
 this emotion of the game is so 

00:06:51.629 --> 00:06:56.810
 it's been pretty cool the truth 

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:58.729
 You already know that this tanda is maybe like 

00:06:56.810 --> 00:06:59.960
 look a little special the next one will be 

00:06:58.729 --> 00:07:01.879
