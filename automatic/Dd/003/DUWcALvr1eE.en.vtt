connector part will plug into the iphone

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.300 
connector part will plug into the iphone
now<00:02:23.730> that<00:02:24.120> will<00:02:24.420> charge<00:02:24.750> your<00:02:25.020> your<00:02:25.470> iPhone<00:02:26.040> up

to<00:02:28.890> go<00:02:29.070> like<00:02:29.880> I<00:02:30.030> was<00:02:30.180> trying<00:02:30.480> to<00:02:30.570> say<00:02:30.810> before

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
to go like I was trying to say before

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.670 
to go like I was trying to say before
it's<00:02:31.560> not<00:02:31.800> a<00:02:31.830> battery<00:02:32.520> of<00:02:32.840> case<00:02:33.840> that<00:02:33.870> attaches

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
it's not a battery of case that attaches

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.910 
it's not a battery of case that attaches
to<00:02:34.950> the<00:02:35.580> to<00:02:35.910> the<00:02:36.230> device<00:02:37.230> and<00:02:37.260> provides

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
to the to the device and provides

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.180 
to the to the device and provides
power<00:02:38.720> throughout<00:02:39.720> like<00:02:40.110> the<00:02:40.290> one<00:02:40.530> the<00:02:40.770> iphone

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
power throughout like the one the iphone

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.640 
power throughout like the one the iphone
4s<00:02:41.640> case<00:02:41.940> they<00:02:42.210> had<00:02:42.450> was<00:02:42.900> actually<00:02:43.320> just<00:02:43.530> the

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
4s case they had was actually just the

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.670 
4s case they had was actually just the
opposite<00:02:44.400> of<00:02:44.520> this<00:02:44.730> you<00:02:45.630> actually<00:02:46.110> plug<00:02:46.440> the

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
opposite of this you actually plug the

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.800 
opposite of this you actually plug the
phone<00:02:46.860> into<00:02:47.250> the<00:02:47.700> battery<00:02:48.090> pack<00:02:48.120> and<00:02:48.390> it

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
phone into the battery pack and it

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.710 
phone into the battery pack and it
charts<00:02:49.230> the<00:02:49.350> phone<00:02:49.620> whenever<00:02:50.340> you<00:02:50.700> need<00:02:50.910> it<00:02:50.940> to

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
charts the phone whenever you need it to

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.990 
charts the phone whenever you need it to
me<00:02:51.900> that's<00:02:52.170> a<00:02:52.290> much<00:02:52.500> better<00:02:52.530> idea<00:02:52.920> than<00:02:53.700> this

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
me that's a much better idea than this

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.590 
me that's a much better idea than this
however<00:02:54.480> this<00:02:55.050> does<00:02:55.520> give<00:02:56.520> you<00:02:56.760> the<00:02:56.910> option<00:02:57.150> of

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600 
however this does give you the option of

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.800 
however this does give you the option of
using<00:02:57.690> it<00:02:58.650> on<00:02:58.800> other<00:02:59.310> devices<00:02:59.610> I<00:03:00.150> think<00:03:00.600> that's

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
using it on other devices I think that's

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.440 
using it on other devices I think that's
what<00:03:01.020> they<00:03:01.200> were<00:03:01.260> going<00:03:01.590> forward<00:03:02.180> but<00:03:03.180> there's

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
what they were going forward but there's

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.900 
what they were going forward but there's
the<00:03:03.690> little<00:03:03.900> case<00:03:04.320> that<00:03:05.070> you'll<00:03:05.340> need<00:03:05.550> to<00:03:05.700> get

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
the little case that you'll need to get

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:07.820 
the little case that you'll need to get
if<00:03:06.120> you<00:03:06.240> want<00:03:06.450> to<00:03:06.600> attach<00:03:06.900> the<00:03:07.200> case<00:03:07.440> to<00:03:07.709> the

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
if you want to attach the case to the

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:10.280 
if you want to attach the case to the
back<00:03:08.040> of<00:03:08.250> the<00:03:08.370> iphone<00:03:08.550> 5<00:03:09.120> and<00:03:09.450> when<00:03:10.080> you<00:03:10.170> do

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
back of the iphone 5 and when you do

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.550 
back of the iphone 5 and when you do
that<00:03:10.530> it<00:03:10.740> attaches<00:03:11.070> and<00:03:11.459> it's<00:03:11.580> it's<00:03:11.850> not<00:03:12.209> very

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
that it attaches and it's it's not very

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.830 
that it attaches and it's it's not very
much<00:03:13.560> heavier<00:03:14.070> however<00:03:15.000> it<00:03:15.150> does<00:03:15.360> add<00:03:15.570> some

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
much heavier however it does add some

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.900 
much heavier however it does add some
bulk<00:03:16.080> to<00:03:16.320> it<00:03:16.470> but<00:03:16.650> it's<00:03:16.890> a<00:03:17.010> trade-off<00:03:17.340> if<00:03:17.760> you

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
bulk to it but it's a trade-off if you

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:20.600 
bulk to it but it's a trade-off if you
need<00:03:18.090> the<00:03:18.209> battery<00:03:18.600> power<00:03:18.890> but<00:03:19.890> to<00:03:20.040> me<00:03:20.190> I<00:03:20.220> would

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.610 
need the battery power but to me I would

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:22.820 
need the battery power but to me I would
just<00:03:20.640> probably<00:03:21.209> carried<00:03:21.720> in<00:03:21.840> my<00:03:21.989> case<00:03:22.260> if

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:22.830 
just probably carried in my case if

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:24.770 
just probably carried in my case if
