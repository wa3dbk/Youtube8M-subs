00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:04.600
 very good to all people how about how 

00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:06.010
 we are here today I bring you the video this 

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:09.070
 that I told you that as soon as I had 

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:10.809
 information I would not know is for 

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:13.960
 get this icon that we are seeing 

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:16.240
 worthy summoner here is going to be 

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:18.520
 it is a code that they will give through 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:20.500
 of the streaming of the finals of day 13 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:22.869
 October in principle people already know 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:26.110
 that they have postponed the semifinals and 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:28.119
 others but the subject of the final in a 

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:30.160
 beginning is the 13th day let's not forget 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:32.590
 if for any reason there are changes as that 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:35.350
 I will also know and well what 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:37.480
 we do with the code s as well as that does not 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:39.610
 how we put it and where it is can be very 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:42.590
 easy the web will be here below the 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:44.840
 description at the time they put it 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:47.390
 the code will be for everyone and 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:49.850
 You will have 24 hours to be able to redeem 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:52.880
 that I have thought to do good I go 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:54.080
 to see the final 100% if something happened 

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:56.720
 extremely important 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:59.870
 logically not but first there's no 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:01.100
 indications of that and I'll see it then 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.540
 What will I do at the moment 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.460
 I have the code or I will let you know 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:06.470
 because there are many people that for what I know 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:08.660
 maybe it is not working or it is not 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:10.250
 at home or anything you are not good 

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:12.320
 24 hours what I'm going to do is what I'm going 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:13.940
 to put on facebook on twitter and 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.540
 I will make a bulletin of this not that sometimes 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:18.560
 to tell you little things I 'll put it 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:20.360
 then once we have the code that 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:24.050
 we do it is very easy it is very simple 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:26.990
 here we are looking at the username this 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:29.450
 is when you open the lol your name is not 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:31.340
 is with which you have registered the 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.759
 mind that is the one that you have to put 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:36.590
 here people in plan pepito password 

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:39.860
 you know the ricoh farm because you put here 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:41.119
 pepito you know pepito me what there is and already 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.950
 is 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:44.270
 then the invoker name because this one 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:46.729
 I know that you have inside the game 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.380
 you know for example mine is black that 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:49.130
 as you all know and the best since the 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:53.119
 to be 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:54.799
 here you put yours and that's it and then 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:58.220
 here you put the code mind is the code 

00:01:54.799 --> 00:02:01.130
 that they put whatever it is and choose your 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:03.590
 region in this case mine would be this one 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:04.850
 give here and automatically you would have 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.740
 the 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.450
 the icon is of people we are going to repeat 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.729
 again the one is the username 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:14.090
 with which you achieve within your 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:15.680
 account 2 is the invoker name the 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:19.040
 that always comes out on the loading screen 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.810
 and your nick in lyon legends and then 3 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.459
 is where you have to enter the code and 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:24.350
 the 4 where you have to put the 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:26.810
 region very very simple people do not have 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:29.590
 more and they give you this that we see here that is 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:32.239
 the icon knock down with his sword and the 2d 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:34.610
 Well, that's what he does with reference to the 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:36.560
 season 2 and a little bit more in front already 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:38.860
 I tell you it 's a pretty fast video that 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:42.110
 was to inform you how to get 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:44.060
 this this summoner icon if there is 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:45.620
 some change in reference how are they going to 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.260
 do or whatever or I 'll let you know from 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.610
 first this is going to be the method 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.989
 confirmed one hundred percent people like that 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:53.150
 that nothing doubts that you have or what 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:55.880
 so be it you can put here another 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.989
 thing that you can do if 24 hours 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.819
 those you have to change the code 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:00.590
 you are not going to be in front of the 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:02.870
 computer or you have it in intention of 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:04.190
 do what you can do to the best 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.780
 in here you can leave comments for 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:08.690
 that someone gave us a hand or some 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:10.549
 friend in plan because you give the data to 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:11.630
 your friend and he puts them for you then 

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:13.070
 it is another possibility 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:14.180
 likewise I already tell you people in the 

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:16.850
 at the moment that I know the code I will 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:18.800
 know everyone and little else so nothing if 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:22.420
 we use all the video the typical I like 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:22.420
 and nothing we see
