12<00:00:41.340> years<00:00:41.670> ago<00:00:41.820> I<00:00:42.059> was<00:00:42.329> working<00:00:42.510> at<00:00:42.809> a<00:00:42.870> very

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
12 years ago I was working at a very

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.200 
12 years ago I was working at a very
exclusive<00:00:43.260> spa<00:00:43.920> and<00:00:44.280> we<00:00:44.579> trained<00:00:44.910> in<00:00:45.120> the

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
exclusive spa and we trained in the

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.779 
exclusive spa and we trained in the
functional<00:00:45.660> back<00:00:45.840> work<00:00:46.140> and<00:00:46.379> then<00:00:46.860> evolved<00:00:47.640> it

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
functional back work and then evolved it

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.310 
functional back work and then evolved it
from<00:00:48.090> there<00:00:48.420> just<00:00:48.719> took<00:00:48.870> it<00:00:49.020> to<00:00:49.140> the<00:00:49.170> next

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
from there just took it to the next

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.010 
from there just took it to the next
level<00:00:49.820> we<00:00:50.820> learned<00:00:51.059> that<00:00:51.180> most<00:00:51.449> of<00:00:51.690> society

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
level we learned that most of society

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.350 
level we learned that most of society
has<00:00:52.559> back<00:00:52.829> problems<00:00:53.070> and<00:00:53.640> it<00:00:53.820> doesn't<00:00:54.149> matter

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
has back problems and it doesn't matter

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.389 
has back problems and it doesn't matter
where<00:00:54.899> you<00:00:55.079> are<00:00:55.260> in<00:00:55.289> your<00:00:55.440> life<00:00:55.739> it<00:00:56.070> could<00:00:56.190> be

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
where you are in your life it could be

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.760 
where you are in your life it could be
from<00:00:56.910> athletes<00:00:57.570> to<00:00:57.840> someone<00:00:58.170> just<00:00:58.379> walking

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
from athletes to someone just walking

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.020 
from athletes to someone just walking
down<00:00:58.800> the<00:00:59.070> street<00:00:59.370> and<00:00:59.399> sometimes<00:00:59.850> just

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
down the street and sometimes just

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.160 
down the street and sometimes just
bending<00:01:00.270> over<00:01:00.510> and<00:01:00.539> picking<00:01:00.840> up<00:01:00.930> something

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
bending over and picking up something

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.709 
bending over and picking up something
they<00:01:01.739> can<00:01:01.949> hurt<00:01:02.070> their<00:01:02.250> back<00:01:02.430> so<00:01:02.789> our<00:01:03.090> idea<00:01:03.120> is

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
they can hurt their back so our idea is

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.750 
they can hurt their back so our idea is
to<00:01:04.110> incorporate<00:01:04.350> this<00:01:04.769> into<00:01:05.010> their<00:01:05.309> workouts

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
to incorporate this into their workouts

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.640 
to incorporate this into their workouts
no<00:01:05.970> matter<00:01:06.210> what<00:01:06.420> level<00:01:06.600> of<00:01:06.840> like<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.170> red<00:01:07.320> and

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
no matter what level of like the red and

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.530 
no matter what level of like the red and
take<00:01:07.979> them<00:01:08.100> through<00:01:08.250> yeah<00:01:08.549> we<00:01:08.790> forget<00:01:09.299> we

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
take them through yeah we forget we

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:10.789 
take them through yeah we forget we
think<00:01:09.810> of<00:01:09.840> going<00:01:09.990> to<00:01:10.140> the<00:01:10.229> gym<00:01:10.409> and<00:01:10.590> working

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
think of going to the gym and working

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.320 
think of going to the gym and working
out<00:01:11.070> and<00:01:11.280> you<00:01:11.369> work<00:01:11.549> out<00:01:11.700> your<00:01:11.880> buys<00:01:12.060> your

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
out and you work out your buys your

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.090 
out and you work out your buys your
tries<00:01:12.570> but<00:01:12.810> you<00:01:12.960> forget<00:01:13.260> that<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.590> back<00:01:13.799> is<00:01:13.979> an

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
tries but you forget that the back is an

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.789 
tries but you forget that the back is an
integral<00:01:14.430> part<00:01:14.490> isn't<00:01:14.820> very<00:01:15.330> much<00:01:15.570> so<00:01:15.960> and<00:01:16.229> the

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
integral part isn't very much so and the

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.950 
integral part isn't very much so and the
flexibility<00:01:17.490> is<00:01:17.670> a<00:01:17.700> big<00:01:17.939> issue<00:01:18.090> a<00:01:18.509> lot<00:01:18.840> of

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
flexibility is a big issue a lot of

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.320 
flexibility is a big issue a lot of
people<00:01:19.170> are<00:01:19.259> tight<00:01:19.590> in<00:01:19.860> their<00:01:20.100> hips<00:01:20.610> their

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
people are tight in their hips their

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.990 
people are tight in their hips their
hamstrings<00:01:22.170> their<00:01:22.530> low<00:01:22.770> back<00:01:23.100> and<00:01:23.400> so<00:01:23.790> a<00:01:23.820> lot

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
hamstrings their low back and so a lot

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.940 
hamstrings their low back and so a lot
of<00:01:24.060> back<00:01:24.330> pain<00:01:24.659> is<00:01:24.900> caused<00:01:25.290> from<00:01:25.530> the<00:01:25.740> time

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
of back pain is caused from the time

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.179 
of back pain is caused from the time
this<00:01:26.220> so<00:01:26.850> our<00:01:27.090> idea<00:01:27.390> is<00:01:27.750> to<00:01:28.170> loosen<00:01:28.530> all<00:01:29.009> of

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
this so our idea is to loosen all of

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:30.530 
this so our idea is to loosen all of
that<00:01:29.340> up<00:01:29.520> and<00:01:29.729> that<00:01:29.880> will<00:01:30.030> help<00:01:30.180> alleviate

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
that up and that will help alleviate

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:31.940 
that up and that will help alleviate

story and so what we'll do is we'll use

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.700 
story and so what we'll do is we'll use
this<00:01:51.030> as<00:01:51.240> an<00:01:51.600> extensor<00:01:52.200> because<00:01:52.470> like<00:01:52.590> I<00:01:52.649> said

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
this as an extensor because like I said

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.020 
this as an extensor because like I said
a<00:01:52.829> lot<00:01:52.979> of<00:01:53.100> people<00:01:53.220> really<00:01:53.340> tight<00:01:53.820> so<00:01:53.939> they

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
a lot of people really tight so they

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.310 
a lot of people really tight so they
don't<00:01:54.210> have<00:01:54.329> the<00:01:54.450> ability<00:01:54.780> to<00:01:54.810> hold<00:01:55.110> their<00:01:55.290> own

don't have the ability to hold their own
legs<00:01:55.740> up<00:01:56.040> they'll<00:01:56.490> probably<00:01:56.520> get<00:01:57.090> grab<00:01:57.479> the

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
legs up they'll probably get grab the

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
get older we begin to shuffle and that's

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.479 
get older we begin to shuffle and that's
because<00:03:13.840> we<00:03:14.049> have<00:03:14.200> no<00:03:14.440> flexibility<00:03:15.220> through

don't<00:04:37.930> want<00:04:38.110> to<00:04:38.169> be<00:04:38.260> there<00:04:38.440> because<00:04:38.620> that

00:04:38.909 --> 00:04:38.919 
don't want to be there because that

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:41.430 
don't want to be there because that
causes<00:04:39.750> extension<00:04:40.750> in<00:04:40.840> the<00:04:40.930> back<00:04:41.110> and<00:04:41.290> there's

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:41.440 
causes extension in the back and there's
