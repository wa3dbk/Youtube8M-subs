00:03:05.839 --> 00:03:05.849 
don't think the demo was very good

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:10.580 
don't think the demo was very good
because<00:03:06.209> I<00:03:06.810> cannot<00:03:07.469> seem<00:03:08.370> to<00:03:08.540> film<00:03:09.540> a<00:03:09.780> demo<00:03:10.139> on

liquid<00:03:11.430> eyeliner<00:03:11.790> very<00:03:12.180> good<00:03:12.919> because<00:03:13.919> my

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
liquid eyeliner very good because my

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:17.030 
liquid eyeliner very good because my
makeup<00:03:14.459> mirror<00:03:14.730> I<00:03:14.939> have<00:03:15.540> to<00:03:15.689> get<00:03:15.840> super<00:03:16.379> close

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
to my makeup mirror to do it and I was

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:23.270 
to my makeup mirror to do it and I was
not<00:03:20.220> as<00:03:20.549> close<00:03:21.000> as<00:03:21.060> I<00:03:21.780> normally<00:03:21.840> am<00:03:22.319> for<00:03:22.949> this<00:03:23.069> I

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
not as close as I normally am for this I

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.619 
not as close as I normally am for this I
and<00:03:23.849> I<00:03:24.299> was<00:03:24.510> using<00:03:24.780> a<00:03:25.139> little<00:03:25.319> compact<00:03:26.099> too<00:03:26.629> so

and I was using a little compact too so
I<00:03:28.019> don't<00:03:28.769> think<00:03:28.919> it<00:03:29.220> was<00:03:29.519> my<00:03:29.970> best<00:03:30.379> application

00:03:31.369 --> 00:03:31.379

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919 
it all even and everything my other

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:21.050 
it all even and everything my other
issue<00:04:17.280> is<00:04:17.729> i<00:04:18.479> can<00:04:18.810> never<00:04:19.019> get<00:04:19.320> both<00:04:20.039> eyes<00:04:20.400> to

match<00:04:21.409> perfectly<00:04:22.409> I<00:04:22.860> guess<00:04:23.490> that's<00:04:23.760> okay

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.330 
match perfectly I guess that's okay

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.910 
match perfectly I guess that's okay
because<00:04:24.830> just<00:04:25.830> like<00:04:25.919> your<00:04:26.099> eyebrows

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:26.920 
because just like your eyebrows

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:29.280 
because just like your eyebrows
your<00:04:26.980> eyebrows<00:04:27.400> are<00:04:27.400> supposed<00:04:28.240> to<00:04:28.390> be<00:04:28.570> sisters

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:29.290 
your eyebrows are supposed to be sisters

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:32.160 
your eyebrows are supposed to be sisters
not<00:04:29.740> twins<00:04:30.160> maybe<00:04:31.090> it<00:04:31.450> goes<00:04:31.630> the<00:04:31.900> same<00:04:31.930> for

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:32.170 
not twins maybe it goes the same for

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:34.770 
not twins maybe it goes the same for
liquid<00:04:32.710> eyeliner<00:04:33.070> I<00:04:33.340> try<00:04:33.730> to<00:04:33.760> make<00:04:34.000> them<00:04:34.210> as

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:38.530 
perfect as I possibly can but sometimes

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:40.440 
perfect as I possibly can but sometimes
I<00:04:39.190> have<00:04:39.400> a<00:04:39.430> good<00:04:39.670> day<00:04:39.820> where<00:04:40.060> they<00:04:40.240> look

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:40.450

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:47.380 
they don't so it just depends on how

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:48.660 
they don't so it just depends on how
they<00:04:47.560> look<00:04:47.590> that<00:04:47.890> day<00:04:48.100> some<00:04:48.490> other
