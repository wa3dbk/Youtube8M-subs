00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:13.190
 distribution has started with the 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:15.620

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:17.029
 we already have it installed today 

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:19.970
 I want to show some of the news 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:21.169
 and possibilities that incorporates the first 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:23.839
 that draws attention and that is evident 

00:00:21.169 --> 00:00:25.339
 is the quick access to adjustments to 

00:00:23.839 --> 00:00:28.009
 that can be reached from the bar 

00:00:25.339 --> 00:00:29.839
 notifications you just have to display the 

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:32.570
 bar and we will see the 12 options of 

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:34.130
 adjustments that we use most this option is already 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:37.640
 well known as it is in 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:39.379

 bluetooth audio modes and various 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:46.070
 more from here we can also go to 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.629
 traditional menu of adjustments that 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:49.280
 still has the same appearance as 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:51.710
 before 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.120
 another feature to highlight and 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.340
 that many users will love 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.589
 is that information has been added and the 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:00.320
 percentage of battery levels in 

00:00:57.589 --> 00:01:02.059
 the top of the htc one before 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.649
 you had to access the settings and the 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:06.399
 Concrete option to see exactly 

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:09.229
 the battery percentage that remained 

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:10.940
 now this percentage of autonomy that 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:12.320
 we are left in the terminal shown 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:15.649
 directly on the home screen 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:17.659

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:18.590

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:21.020
 lock screen 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:23.060
 this could already be done before in the htc 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.429
 one thanks to the different profiles of 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:28.520

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:30.649

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.750

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:35.899
