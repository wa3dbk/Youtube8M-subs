tortoise care now for basic structure

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.919 
tortoise care now for basic structure
here<00:00:13.679> I<00:00:13.860> used<00:00:14.580> a<00:00:14.759> cement<00:00:15.150> mixing<00:00:15.420> tub<00:00:15.690> that<00:00:15.839> I

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
here I used a cement mixing tub that I

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.830 
here I used a cement mixing tub that I
purchased<00:00:16.410> from<00:00:16.590> Lowe's<00:00:17.090> very<00:00:18.090> inexpensive

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
purchased from Lowe's very inexpensive

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.570 
purchased from Lowe's very inexpensive
and<00:00:18.960> really<00:00:19.230> perfect<00:00:19.920> for<00:00:20.010> keeping<00:00:20.250> these

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
and really perfect for keeping these

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.710 
and really perfect for keeping these
tortoises<00:00:21.710> now<00:00:22.710> it's<00:00:23.460> got<00:00:23.789> great<00:00:24.119> dimensions

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
tortoises now it's got great dimensions

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.269 
tortoises now it's got great dimensions
so<00:00:24.900> it's<00:00:25.019> definitely<00:00:25.500> big<00:00:25.800> enough<00:00:25.980> for<00:00:26.039> the

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
so it's definitely big enough for the

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.700 
so it's definitely big enough for the
tortoises<00:00:26.699> and<00:00:26.970> it<00:00:27.029> also<00:00:27.210> has<00:00:27.570> sides<00:00:28.380> that<00:00:28.680> are

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
tortoises and it also has sides that are

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.400 
tortoises and it also has sides that are
not<00:00:28.980> see-through<00:00:29.220> like<00:00:29.640> glass<00:00:30.000> or<00:00:30.330> tanks<00:00:31.080> so

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
not see-through like glass or tanks so

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.590 
not see-through like glass or tanks so
it's<00:00:31.769> much<00:00:32.099> better<00:00:32.340> and<00:00:32.489> less<00:00:32.790> confusing<00:00:33.270> for

fixtures<00:00:55.289> you<00:00:55.500> can<00:00:55.680> use<00:00:55.920> the<00:00:56.340> dome<00:00:56.520> lights

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
fixtures you can use the dome lights

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.599 
fixtures you can use the dome lights
like<00:00:57.000> I<00:00:57.180> have<00:00:57.390> here<00:00:57.660> I<00:00:57.890> always<00:00:58.890> advise<00:00:59.280> they

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
like I have here I always advise they

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:04.369 
like I have here I always advise they
have<00:00:59.789> the<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.359> ceramic<00:01:00.840> tops<00:01:01.140> as<00:01:02.870> a<00:01:03.870> substrate

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
have the the ceramic tops as a substrate

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.630 
have the the ceramic tops as a substrate
here<00:01:04.680> I<00:01:04.890> use<00:01:05.489> a<00:01:05.519> mix<00:01:05.970> of<00:01:06.530> cocoa<00:01:07.530> fiber<00:01:07.830> cocoa

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
here I use a mix of cocoa fiber cocoa

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.539 
here I use a mix of cocoa fiber cocoa
husk<00:01:08.880> as<00:01:09.180> well<00:01:09.420> as<00:01:09.510> a<00:01:09.570> bit<00:01:09.720> of<00:01:09.810> rough<00:01:09.990> debark

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:10.549 
husk as well as a bit of rough debark

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:13.490 
husk as well as a bit of rough debark
the<00:01:11.549> bark<00:01:11.760> your<00:01:11.939> substrates<00:01:12.450> are<00:01:12.689> okay<00:01:13.020> use<00:01:13.260> in

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
the bark your substrates are okay use in

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.050 
the bark your substrates are okay use in
my<00:01:13.619> experience<00:01:14.189> because<00:01:14.369> they<00:01:14.640> help<00:01:14.820> keep<00:01:15.000> the

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
my experience because they help keep the

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.880 
my experience because they help keep the
dust<00:01:15.420> down<00:01:15.509> and<00:01:15.900> out<00:01:15.990> of<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.259> tortoises<00:01:16.650> eyes

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
dust down and out of the tortoises eyes

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.899 
dust down and out of the tortoises eyes
and<00:01:18.560> the<00:01:19.560> real<00:01:19.890> important<00:01:20.340> consideration

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
and the real important consideration

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.340 
and the real important consideration
with<00:01:21.060> Russian<00:01:21.420> tortoises<00:01:21.630> is<00:01:22.049> that<00:01:22.229> the

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
with Russian tortoises is that the

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:23.690 
with Russian tortoises is that the
substrate<00:01:22.710> is<00:01:22.830> something<00:01:23.159> they<00:01:23.280> can<00:01:23.460> burrow

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
substrate is something they can burrow

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.980 
substrate is something they can burrow
in<00:01:24.380> so<00:01:25.640> that<00:01:26.640> is<00:01:26.850> very<00:01:27.119> important<00:01:27.600> because<00:01:27.689> the

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
in so that is very important because the

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.020 
in so that is very important because the
tortoises<00:01:28.439> do<00:01:28.829> burrow<00:01:29.100> when<00:01:29.610> mine<00:01:29.820> go<00:01:30.000> to

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
tortoises do burrow when mine go to

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.340 
tortoises do burrow when mine go to
sleep<00:01:30.329> they<00:01:30.540> definitely<00:01:31.430> burrow<00:01:32.430> down<00:01:33.140> to<00:01:34.140> do

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
sleep they definitely burrow down to do

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.710 
sleep they definitely burrow down to do
that<00:01:34.640> now<00:01:35.640> it's<00:01:35.880> important<00:01:36.329> that<00:01:36.360> you<00:01:36.450> do<00:01:36.600> have

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
that now it's important that you do have

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.300 
that now it's important that you do have
enough<00:01:36.990> substrate<00:01:37.500> to<00:01:37.680> for<00:01:37.860> them<00:01:37.950> for<00:01:38.159> oh<00:01:38.220> I

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
enough substrate to for them for oh I

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.179 
enough substrate to for them for oh I
have<00:01:38.549> about<00:01:38.670> two<00:01:39.000> and<00:01:39.030> a<00:01:39.150> half<00:01:39.299> inches<00:01:39.659> in<00:01:39.720> here

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:40.189 
have about two and a half inches in here

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:42.380 
have about two and a half inches in here
that<00:01:41.189> way<00:01:41.310> they<00:01:41.430> can<00:01:41.579> really<00:01:41.729> get<00:01:41.970> into<00:01:42.299> the

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
that way they can really get into the

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.800 
that way they can really get into the
substrate

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:44.810 
substrate

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.080 
substrate
now<00:01:45.380> I<00:01:45.440> do<00:01:45.650> have<00:01:45.740> this<00:01:45.950> custom<00:01:46.400> feature<00:01:46.640> and<00:01:46.940> my

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.090 
now I do have this custom feature and my

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:48.700 
now I do have this custom feature and my
enclosure<00:01:47.450> it<00:01:47.630> isn't<00:01:47.869> necessary<00:01:48.350> but<00:01:48.590> it's

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:48.710 
enclosure it isn't necessary but it's

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:52.600 
enclosure it isn't necessary but it's
it's<00:01:49.100> great<00:01:49.369> fun<00:01:49.549> to<00:01:49.820> watch<00:01:50.000> them<00:01:50.360> with<00:01:51.400> it<00:01:52.400> is

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:52.610

baseboard here and you can just recess a

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.180 
baseboard here and you can just recess a
pool<00:02:30.530> like<00:02:30.769> that<00:02:31.069> and<00:02:32.260> that's<00:02:33.260> nice<00:02:33.860> for<00:02:34.100> the

pool like that and that's nice for the

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:35.860 
pool like that and that's nice for the
tortoises<00:02:34.580> because<00:02:34.940> they<00:02:35.090> can<00:02:35.300> climb<00:02:35.540> right

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
tortoises because they can climb right

in<00:02:35.930> and<00:02:36.260> out<00:02:36.410> i<00:02:36.769> also<00:02:37.430> the<00:02:37.610> cuttlebone<00:02:38.060> up<00:02:38.239> here

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
in and out i also the cuttlebone up here

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:41.290 
in and out i also the cuttlebone up here
that<00:02:38.600> helps<00:02:38.870> boost<00:02:39.050> calcium<00:02:39.620> and<00:02:40.150> this<00:02:41.150> is

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:41.300 
that helps boost calcium and this is

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.030 
that helps boost calcium and this is
just<00:02:41.450> basic<00:02:41.780> craft<00:02:42.050> fence<00:02:42.350> attached<00:02:42.650> to<00:02:42.920> the

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
just basic craft fence attached to the

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:44.979 
just basic craft fence attached to the
side<00:02:43.250> here<00:02:43.430> and<00:02:43.640> that<00:02:43.880> works<00:02:44.120> great<00:02:44.300> as<00:02:44.690> a<00:02:44.750> way

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:44.989 
side here and that works great as a way

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:49.120 
side here and that works great as a way
to<00:02:45.050> keep<00:02:45.380> them<00:02:46.900> from<00:02:47.900> tumbling<00:02:48.470> off<00:02:48.739> the<00:02:48.950> top

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130 
to keep them from tumbling off the top

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:52.000 
to keep them from tumbling off the top
there<00:02:49.400> and<00:02:49.970> the<00:02:50.120> foliage<00:02:50.480> again<00:02:50.810> works<00:02:51.709> well

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
there and the foliage again works well

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:55.810 
there and the foliage again works well
here's<00:02:52.640> some<00:02:52.910> some<00:02:53.660> chain<00:02:53.930> vine<00:02:54.430> you<00:02:55.430> can<00:02:55.610> see

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:55.820 
here's some some chain vine you can see

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:57.400 
here's some some chain vine you can see
it<00:02:55.940> can<00:02:56.090> cut<00:02:56.299> that<00:02:56.450> to<00:02:56.630> the<00:02:56.720> right<00:02:56.870> dimensions

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
it can cut that to the right dimensions

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:00.280 
it can cut that to the right dimensions
hang<00:02:57.739> that<00:02:57.980> for<00:02:58.370> any<00:02:58.579> reptile<00:02:59.540> or<00:02:59.780> animal

hang that for any reptile or animal

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:03.870 
hang that for any reptile or animal
enclosure<00:03:00.910> the<00:03:01.910> chain<00:03:02.390> vine<00:03:02.570> works<00:03:02.810> be<00:03:03.019> great

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:03.880 
enclosure the chain vine works be great

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.460 
enclosure the chain vine works be great
now<00:03:04.880> for<00:03:05.120> a<00:03:05.150> ramp<00:03:05.390> here<00:03:05.600> I<00:03:05.630> have<00:03:05.900> just<00:03:06.110> craft

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470 
now for a ramp here I have just craft

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:09.280 
now for a ramp here I have just craft
wood<00:03:06.829> and<00:03:07.130> I<00:03:07.610> wrapped<00:03:07.880> it<00:03:08.090> in<00:03:08.239> hemp<00:03:08.540> twine<00:03:08.810> so

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
wood and I wrapped it in hemp twine so

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:10.780 
wood and I wrapped it in hemp twine so
that<00:03:09.440> gives<00:03:09.650> them<00:03:09.769> something<00:03:10.040> to<00:03:10.190> grip<00:03:10.549> to

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790 
that gives them something to grip to

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:13.720 
that gives them something to grip to
climb<00:03:11.060> up<00:03:11.709> that<00:03:12.709> works<00:03:12.950> pretty<00:03:13.220> well<00:03:13.340> now

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:13.730 
climb up that works pretty well now

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:15.220 
climb up that works pretty well now
throughout<00:03:13.970> the<00:03:14.150> enclosure<00:03:14.450> I<00:03:14.600> use<00:03:14.930> little

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230 
throughout the enclosure I use little

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:17.530 
throughout the enclosure I use little
rocks<00:03:15.620> little<00:03:16.220> pieces<00:03:16.430> of<00:03:16.700> foliage<00:03:16.910> just<00:03:17.420> to

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:17.540 
rocks little pieces of foliage just to

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:19.030 
rocks little pieces of foliage just to
make<00:03:17.690> it<00:03:17.810> more<00:03:17.930> aesthetically<00:03:18.350> pleasing<00:03:18.410> for

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 
make it more aesthetically pleasing for

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:23.500 
make it more aesthetically pleasing for
both<00:03:19.280> myself<00:03:19.489> and<00:03:19.880> the<00:03:20.030> tortoises<00:03:21.880> then<00:03:22.880> it<00:03:23.359> is

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:23.510 
both myself and the tortoises then it is

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:26.020 
both myself and the tortoises then it is
also<00:03:23.780> important<00:03:24.410> that<00:03:24.470> you<00:03:24.739> use<00:03:25.100> a<00:03:25.400> hide<00:03:25.640> for

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:26.030 
also important that you use a hide for

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:28.000 
also important that you use a hide for
the<00:03:26.269> tortoises<00:03:26.720> they<00:03:27.049> do<00:03:27.109> like<00:03:27.350> to<00:03:27.590> have<00:03:27.739> a

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.010 
the tortoises they do like to have a

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:31.690 
the tortoises they do like to have a
place<00:03:28.609> to<00:03:28.910> to<00:03:29.600> take<00:03:29.750> cover<00:03:29.989> I<00:03:30.400> have<00:03:31.400> the<00:03:31.519> half

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:31.700 
place to to take cover I have the half

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:33.250 
place to to take cover I have the half
log<00:03:32.000> hide<00:03:32.269> here<00:03:32.480> it's<00:03:32.600> definitely<00:03:33.019> large

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:33.260 
log hide here it's definitely large

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:34.569 
log hide here it's definitely large
enough<00:03:33.500> for<00:03:33.530> the<00:03:33.680> tortoises<00:03:34.130> to<00:03:34.310> climb

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:34.579 
enough for the tortoises to climb

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:36.520 
enough for the tortoises to climb
through<00:03:34.910> they<00:03:35.180> can<00:03:35.209> also<00:03:35.450> climb<00:03:35.810> up<00:03:36.049> the<00:03:36.380> half

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:36.530 
through they can also climb up the half

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:40.270 
through they can also climb up the half
log<00:03:36.769> and<00:03:36.980> they<00:03:37.040> do<00:03:37.100> do<00:03:37.430> that<00:03:37.670> sometimes<00:03:38.950> in<00:03:39.950> my

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:40.280 
log and they do do that sometimes in my

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:42.250 
log and they do do that sometimes in my
enclosure<00:03:40.730> then<00:03:41.660> I<00:03:41.750> also<00:03:41.900> have<00:03:42.170> the

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.260 
enclosure then I also have the

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.680 
enclosure then I also have the
terracotta<00:03:42.799> pot<00:03:43.190> back<00:03:43.489> here<00:03:43.850> and<00:03:44.030> in<00:03:44.600> a

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:44.690 
terracotta pot back here and in a

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:46.000 
terracotta pot back here and in a
picture<00:03:44.959> it<00:03:45.019> actually<00:03:45.320> looks<00:03:45.470> pretty<00:03:45.560> small

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.010 
picture it actually looks pretty small

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:48.460 
picture it actually looks pretty small
but<00:03:46.880> it's<00:03:47.030> a<00:03:47.090> good<00:03:47.239> size<00:03:47.420> a<00:03:47.450> tourist<00:03:47.930> can<00:03:48.170> climb

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:48.470 
but it's a good size a tourist can climb

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:52.300 
but it's a good size a tourist can climb
through<00:03:48.769> there<00:03:49.120> or<00:03:50.120> in<00:03:50.420> there<00:03:50.630> rather<00:03:50.840> and<00:03:51.310> in

the terracotta pot is a substrate I use
some<00:03:54.409> Bermuda<00:03:54.620> grass<00:03:55.129> that<00:03:55.580> allows<00:03:55.909> them<00:03:56.180> to

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:56.209 
some Bermuda grass that allows them to

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:58.300 
some Bermuda grass that allows them to
take<00:03:56.360> a<00:03:56.510> quick<00:03:56.810> snack<00:03:57.170> even<00:03:57.709> if<00:03:57.890> by

of<00:04:02.480> the<00:04:02.540> terracotta<00:04:02.989> pot<00:04:03.230> I<00:04:03.410> used<00:04:03.470> a<00:04:04.040> little

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:04.250 
of the terracotta pot I used a little

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:07.210 
of the terracotta pot I used a little
bit<00:04:04.340> of<00:04:05.050> driftwood<00:04:06.050> that<00:04:06.290> just<00:04:06.920> gives<00:04:07.099> them

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:07.220 
bit of driftwood that just gives them

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:08.920 
bit of driftwood that just gives them
something<00:04:07.520> to<00:04:07.670> climb<00:04:08.000> on<00:04:08.180> and<00:04:08.360> again<00:04:08.569> booths

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:08.930 
something to climb on and again booths

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:12.100 
something to climb on and again booths
aesthetics<00:04:09.819> so<00:04:10.819> these<00:04:11.209> tortoises<00:04:11.540> may<00:04:11.870> seem

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:12.110 
aesthetics so these tortoises may seem

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:14.170 
aesthetics so these tortoises may seem
like<00:04:12.260> something<00:04:12.560> that<00:04:12.980> just<00:04:13.130> wants<00:04:13.670> to<00:04:13.700> crawl

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:14.180 
like something that just wants to crawl

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:15.610 
like something that just wants to crawl
along<00:04:14.300> the<00:04:14.450> substrate<00:04:15.019> but<00:04:15.170> they<00:04:15.290> do<00:04:15.349> like<00:04:15.590> to

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:15.620 
along the substrate but they do like to

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:20.949 
along the substrate but they do like to
burrow<00:04:15.980> and<00:04:16.250> climb<00:04:18.519> now<00:04:19.519> this<00:04:19.910> is<00:04:20.180> my<00:04:20.570> first

00:04:33.129 --> 00:04:33.139 
it's very cute but just to to diminish

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:35.460 
it's very cute but just to to diminish
the<00:04:33.290> chances<00:04:33.320> that<00:04:33.800> there<00:04:34.070> would<00:04:34.160> ever<00:04:34.280> be<00:04:34.610> any

spring mix filled grains some carrots

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:59.170 
spring mix filled grains some carrots
mixed<00:04:55.669> in<00:04:55.790> that's<00:04:56.360> okay<00:04:56.510> as<00:04:56.990> a<00:04:57.850> treat<00:04:58.850> you<00:04:58.970> can

00:04:59.170 --> 00:04:59.180 
mixed in that's okay as a treat you can

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:01.870 
mixed in that's okay as a treat you can
use<00:04:59.360> fruit<00:04:59.690> I<00:04:59.960> fed<00:05:00.800> some<00:05:00.979> cantaloupe<00:05:01.400> recently

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:01.880 
use fruit I fed some cantaloupe recently

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:03.279 
use fruit I fed some cantaloupe recently
but<00:05:02.000> that<00:05:02.090> has<00:05:02.240> to<00:05:02.270> be<00:05:02.419> rare<00:05:02.750> because<00:05:02.990> it's

00:05:03.279 --> 00:05:03.289 
but that has to be rare because it's

00:05:03.289 --> 00:05:06.490 
but that has to be rare because it's
relatively<00:05:04.010> high<00:05:04.340> in<00:05:04.580> sugar<00:05:04.910> and<00:05:05.180> then<00:05:06.169> on<00:05:06.260> top

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:06.500 
relatively high in sugar and then on top

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:08.560 
relatively high in sugar and then on top
of<00:05:06.560> their<00:05:06.800> food<00:05:07.010> I<00:05:07.280> do<00:05:07.400> use<00:05:07.729> a<00:05:07.760> bit<00:05:08.030> of<00:05:08.150> the

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:08.570 
of their food I do use a bit of the

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:11.529 
of their food I do use a bit of the
Bermuda<00:05:09.020> grass<00:05:09.289> as<00:05:09.620> well<00:05:10.610> and<00:05:10.880> that<00:05:11.270> works

00:05:11.529 --> 00:05:11.539 
Bermuda grass as well and that works

00:05:11.539 --> 00:05:13.920 
Bermuda grass as well and that works
pretty<00:05:11.840> well<00:05:11.960> it's<00:05:12.830> really<00:05:13.280> designed<00:05:13.460> for

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:13.930 
pretty well it's really designed for

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:18.310 
pretty well it's really designed for
animals<00:05:14.930> like<00:05:15.140> rodents<00:05:15.620> but<00:05:15.950> it's<00:05:16.640> um<00:05:17.320> it's

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:18.320 
animals like rodents but it's um it's

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:19.930 
animals like rodents but it's um it's
designed<00:05:18.680> as<00:05:18.860> a<00:05:18.890> substrate<00:05:19.370> but<00:05:19.610> it<00:05:19.729> really

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:19.940 
designed as a substrate but it really

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:22.090 
designed as a substrate but it really
works<00:05:20.240> well<00:05:20.510> you<00:05:21.140> can<00:05:21.320> feed<00:05:21.530> in<00:05:21.680> larger

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:22.100 
works well you can feed in larger

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:24.550 
works well you can feed in larger
volumes<00:05:22.460> if<00:05:22.910> you<00:05:23.390> do<00:05:23.570> mix<00:05:23.780> in<00:05:23.930> some<00:05:24.229> of<00:05:24.380> the

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:24.560 
volumes if you do mix in some of the

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:28.180 
volumes if you do mix in some of the
Bermuda<00:05:24.979> grass<00:05:25.370> or<00:05:25.610> timothy<00:05:25.970> hay<00:05:26.120> and<00:05:26.979> then<00:05:27.979> on

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:28.190 
Bermuda grass or timothy hay and then on

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:30.870 
Bermuda grass or timothy hay and then on
top<00:05:28.430> of<00:05:28.580> all<00:05:28.789> that<00:05:28.820> i<00:05:29.060> use<00:05:29.450> a<00:05:29.690> little<00:05:29.960> spray<00:05:30.380> of

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:30.880 
top of all that i use a little spray of

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:35.409 
top of all that i use a little spray of
calcium<00:05:31.880> supplement<00:05:32.389> and<00:05:33.940> that<00:05:34.940> works<00:05:35.150> great

00:05:35.409 --> 00:05:35.419 
calcium supplement and that works great

00:05:35.419 --> 00:05:37.659 
calcium supplement and that works great
to<00:05:35.660> help<00:05:35.780> boost<00:05:36.020> calcium<00:05:36.710> that<00:05:37.039> in<00:05:37.280> addition

00:05:37.659 --> 00:05:37.669 
to help boost calcium that in addition

00:05:37.669 --> 00:05:39.279 
to help boost calcium that in addition
to<00:05:37.700> a<00:05:37.850> cuttlebone<00:05:38.330> really<00:05:38.720> make<00:05:38.900> sure<00:05:39.080> that

00:05:39.279 --> 00:05:39.289 
to a cuttlebone really make sure that

00:05:39.289 --> 00:05:41.230 
to a cuttlebone really make sure that
your<00:05:39.410> tortoise<00:05:39.740> is<00:05:39.889> staying<00:05:40.280> healthy<00:05:40.820> with

your tortoise is staying healthy with

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:45.320 
your tortoise is staying healthy with
the<00:05:41.930> right<00:05:42.080> amount<00:05:42.289> of<00:05:42.320> calcium

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:45.330 

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:47.730 

now<00:05:46.330> the<00:05:46.660> other<00:05:46.810> thing<00:05:47.080> that<00:05:47.229> I<00:05:47.320> do<00:05:47.380> for<00:05:47.680> my

00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:35.940 
longer to the point where it actually

00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:40.100 
longer to the point where it actually
has<00:07:36.300> to<00:07:36.479> be<00:07:36.599> wrapped<00:07:38.060> so<00:07:39.060> that<00:07:39.389> isn't<00:07:39.750> 100%

00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:40.110 
has to be wrapped so that isn't 100%

00:07:40.110 --> 00:07:42.499 
has to be wrapped so that isn't 100%
accurate<00:07:40.860> but<00:07:41.220> it's<00:07:41.370> a<00:07:41.460> fairly<00:07:41.820> accurate<00:07:42.120> and

00:07:42.499 --> 00:07:42.509
