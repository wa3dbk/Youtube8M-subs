launch Plex from the desktop the next

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:11.160 
launch Plex from the desktop the next
step<00:04:09.040> is<00:04:09.190> to<00:04:09.310> add<00:04:09.460> media<00:04:09.730> sources<00:04:10.450> in<00:04:10.750> this

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:11.170 
step is to add media sources in this

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:13.320 
step is to add media sources in this
example<00:04:11.530> we'll<00:04:11.830> add<00:04:12.070> our<00:04:12.100> movies<00:04:12.610> library<00:04:13.090> but

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:13.330 
example we'll add our movies library but

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:16.050 
example we'll add our movies library but
all<00:04:13.510> the<00:04:13.690> media<00:04:13.990> is<00:04:14.080> added<00:04:14.470> this<00:04:14.620> way<00:04:15.060> first

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:16.060 
all the media is added this way first

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:17.729 
all the media is added this way first
we'll<00:04:16.420> need<00:04:16.450> to<00:04:16.600> go<00:04:16.780> back<00:04:16.930> to<00:04:16.989> the<00:04:17.230> main<00:04:17.440> screen

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:17.739 
we'll need to go back to the main screen

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:26.730 
we'll need to go back to the main screen
and<00:04:17.890> navigate<00:04:18.519> to<00:04:18.730> videos<00:04:24.870> then<00:04:25.870> navigate<00:04:26.500> to
