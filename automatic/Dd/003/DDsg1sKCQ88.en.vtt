00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:25.240 
minute so after you made your first tray
that<00:03:23.989> first<00:03:24.319> technique<00:03:24.650> i<00:03:24.800> showed<00:03:25.010> you<00:03:25.040> will

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
that first technique i showed you will

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:27.970 
that first technique i showed you will
always<00:03:25.580> work<00:03:25.790> ok<00:03:26.569> but<00:03:27.260> after<00:03:27.500> you've<00:03:27.769> made<00:03:27.950> a

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:27.980 
always work ok but after you've made a

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:29.350 
always work ok but after you've made a
charity<00:03:28.519> and<00:03:28.670> you<00:03:28.730> start<00:03:28.940> to<00:03:29.030> feel<00:03:29.180> more

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:29.360 
charity and you start to feel more

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:30.970 
charity and you start to feel more
confident<00:03:29.870> there<00:03:30.080> is<00:03:30.260> a<00:03:30.290> separate<00:03:30.830> a

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:30.980 
confident there is a separate a

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:33.460 
confident there is a separate a
different<00:03:31.910> technique<00:03:32.299> that<00:03:32.900> works<00:03:33.049> quite

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:33.470 
different technique that works quite

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:35.380 
different technique that works quite
well<00:03:33.500> it<00:03:34.220> goes<00:03:34.400> pretty<00:03:34.610> quick<00:03:34.940> so<00:03:35.090> i<00:03:35.120> think<00:03:35.239> i

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:35.390 
well it goes pretty quick so i think i

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:37.570 
well it goes pretty quick so i think i
might<00:03:35.540> have<00:03:35.599> to<00:03:35.720> slow<00:03:35.989> the<00:03:36.049> camera<00:03:36.410> now<00:03:36.580> after

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:37.580 
might have to slow the camera now after

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:39.780 
might have to slow the camera now after
so<00:03:37.970> you<00:03:38.060> just<00:03:38.120> put<00:03:38.299> the<00:03:38.510> wrapper<00:03:38.840> on<00:03:38.870> your<00:03:39.110> hand

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790 
so you just put the wrapper on your hand

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:42.789 
so you just put the wrapper on your hand
pick<00:03:40.790> up<00:03:40.910> your<00:03:41.120> fillings<00:03:41.540> slap<00:03:41.930> it<00:03:42.200> pick<00:03:42.470> it<00:03:42.530> up

00:03:42.789 --> 00:03:42.799 
pick up your fillings slap it pick it up

00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:58.720 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:00.180 

because<00:03:59.320> frankly<00:03:59.710> if<00:03:59.800> you're<00:03:59.890> going<00:04:00.010> to<00:04:00.070> be

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:00.190 
because frankly if you're going to be

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:01.590 
because frankly if you're going to be
making<00:04:00.340> six<00:04:00.790> or<00:04:00.940> eight<00:04:01.030> trays<00:04:01.300> in<00:04:01.480> these

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:01.600 
making six or eight trays in these

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:04.220 
making six or eight trays in these
things<00:04:01.980> it<00:04:02.980> looks<00:04:03.160> really<00:04:03.340> nice<00:04:03.550> to<00:04:03.790> do<00:04:03.910> that

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
things it looks really nice to do that

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:06.810 
things it looks really nice to do that
the<00:04:05.230> first<00:04:05.560> time<00:04:05.800> but<00:04:06.250> you<00:04:06.400> don't<00:04:06.430> want<00:04:06.670> to<00:04:06.730> be

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:06.820 
the first time but you don't want to be

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:09.980 
the first time but you don't want to be
doing<00:04:06.970> that<00:04:07.060> all<00:04:07.300> day<00:04:07.410> but<00:04:08.410> until<00:04:08.950> you<00:04:09.100> get

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:09.990 
doing that all day but until you get

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:13.320 
doing that all day but until you get
accomplished<00:04:10.990> that<00:04:11.170> this<00:04:11.760> the<00:04:12.760> easiest<00:04:13.090> way

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:13.330 
accomplished that this the easiest way

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:14.790 
accomplished that this the easiest way
to<00:04:13.390> do<00:04:13.600> it<00:04:13.720> is<00:04:13.840> always<00:04:14.110> the<00:04:14.260> best<00:04:14.290> the<00:04:14.680> way

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:14.800 
to do it is always the best the way

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:19.080 
to do it is always the best the way
that's<00:04:15.010> going<00:04:15.160> to<00:04:15.220> work<00:04:16.920> but<00:04:17.920> after<00:04:18.160> you<00:04:18.430> tried

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:19.090 
that's going to work but after you tried

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:22.110 
that's going to work but after you tried
this<00:04:19.269> sort<00:04:19.570> of<00:04:19.600> it<00:04:19.780> you'll<00:04:20.079> see<00:04:20.489> that<00:04:21.489> this<00:04:21.760> is

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.120 
this sort of it you'll see that this is

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:31.590
