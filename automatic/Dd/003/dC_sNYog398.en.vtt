 So here is 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:38.820
 so I am you see here and afp textures 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.200
 so the advice 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:46.410
 2 the textures of these cars, all those who are waiting for 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:51.060
 in fact it is a work in the matches of the Le Mans team which are 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.760
 special paints not because 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:55.850
 look 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.939
 but look for them and we slowly recover 3 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:03.840
 well 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.960
 example in our enclosure so 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.079
 here it is Sunday 

00:02:09.079 --> 00:02:12.369
 so that's why these debts like that 

00:02:12.369 --> 00:02:15.980
 waltz so here is a texture that I modified 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.299
 so the first picture like that 

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:21.299
 it shows you the pause but hush first of course 

00:02:22.229 --> 00:02:24.189
 If you want 

00:02:24.189 --> 00:02:28.430
 modified from the image already present with a basic problem of 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.069
 these tobacco indications 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:30.849
 by the way 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:32.299
 export 

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:36.359
 but I'm scared on psg because it's a comment it's the best 

00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:40.329
 better shape does it have an age but what do you want 

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:43.329
 personally I feel at the registered fall office 

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:49.659
 to motivate the trick as you like 

00:02:49.659 --> 00:02:52.359
 ready as far as that on that 

00:02:52.359 --> 00:02:55.659
 so for you have any crime added door 

00:02:55.659 --> 00:02:58.659
 of course as always the same thing euros per square meter 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:03.509
 so after wawatie of the imagined series - when I have an image afp 

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:05.949
 lyon i live in the picture before 

00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:07.559
 so 

00:03:07.559 --> 00:03:10.719

00:03:10.719 --> 00:03:14.749
 the place are just his jazz music a texture and that one 

00:03:15.369 --> 00:03:18.369
 that's after that the fact is it's ld 

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:21.629
 you leave it on at least I can click as I already have the 

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:23.219
 question 

00:03:23.219 --> 00:03:25.859

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:27.909
 guilty or not 

00:03:27.909 --> 00:03:31.269
 and not tested and for a black drawing you like it 

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:35.469
 so percent 

00:03:35.469 --> 00:03:39.590
 here you have learned to command a china textures through a desire 

00:03:39.589 --> 00:03:42.589
 October 

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:47.049

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:51.979
 the exchange it takes photoshop choc it's 

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:55.389
 it's an excellent mail client it's really powerful and it's really good 

00:03:55.389 --> 00:03:56.669
 good 

00:03:56.669 --> 00:04:00.029
