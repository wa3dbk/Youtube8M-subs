00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.190
 It's been a week since you saved 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.660
 the attack belt around here and so on 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:10.920
 etc 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:13.429
 it could look very good it could be very 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.429
 easy 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:20.820
 what voltage that tension that started the 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.769
 boy that tension I think it's going to 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.390
 stay here and I'll wait for it not 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.130
 has to keep the same good 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.840
 kill and damn guard please 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.840
 beware kill kill people uncle 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.789
 I would lie to you if I said that this did not give me 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.820
 guys staying three to get me the 

00:00:38.789 --> 00:00:44.309
 outbreak against all and because it 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.859
 remain but that create error that 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:50.159
 Matara has emerged and is that it was in 

00:00:46.859 --> 00:00:53.399
 series the current one we have to take out the 

00:00:50.159 --> 00:00:56.010
 ferocious against all that is 30 but 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:01:01.100
 against everyone so with nothing more than 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.100
 live we go with the first episode 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:16.960
 as kids we are here wielding the 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:18.850
 rx 160 the steel dance as they can 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.860
 commenting in the meantime the class but 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:23.800
 for now I want to be a bit focused 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:27.710
 in employment as against a 30 0 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:31.570
 all is quite like saying it 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.570
 complicated but good nothing happens 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:43.310
 you know that right now we can no longer 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:46.090
 go any time so there is the 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:46.090
 grace of the series 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:52.620
 with care carefully with 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.620
 cautious 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:01.380
 for good good good well good 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:06.600
 ok let's hide a little bit 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:09.909
 why 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:12.909
 we are already in the middle of the game 

00:02:09.909 --> 00:02:12.909
 none 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:20.500
 voucher voucher 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.500
 sometimes we find some enemy 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:29.630
 it's okay mommy uncle sam and bursts 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:34.340
 he gets awesome 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:34.340
 my mother, my mother, these people 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:38.470
 valeria we removed from this kit a 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.470
 burst 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:45.910
 so there must be 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.910
 to steal we take this one here 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:55.590
 It's good to be saved and guys what 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:57.540

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.580
 valeria well well well well well 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.110

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:05.430
 bomber and we're going to throw him more or 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.310
 less for this area 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:11.000
 I think we will kill someone safe 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:11.000
 let's try it at least 

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:22.620
 inexorable to tighten well 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:32.019

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:38.260
 partner 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:41.940
 16 08 vouchers 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:44.740

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:49.720

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:51.730

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:57.010
 taken out there to start the game to 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:59.140
 butt mother of mine this is a first 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:00.400
 Pretty cool episode, I'm going to 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:01.540
 comment a little bit about the class that has been 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:03.250
 said that he was going to comment 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:04.440
 but here with the nerves of the rapid and 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:07.390
 so I have stuck to the road 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:08.380
 I'm in putting you x 180 steve wright 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:11.800

 It's worth, okay, I'll take it with what 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:17.140
 I kept looking at the red rite and silencer 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:18.670
 since he is doing quite well and is still 

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:21.430
 being against everyone because that's not 

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:23.350
 comes quite well enough I think that 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:25.110
 is the most necessary thing that we have to 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:27.760
 put in together everyone because if not 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:31.380
