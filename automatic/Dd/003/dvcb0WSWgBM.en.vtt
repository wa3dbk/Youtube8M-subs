The AMERICAN MOSS Stitch. Hi, Guys, I’m
Kristen and Welcome to Studio Knit! It’s

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:15.000
Knitting Lesson Monday and today we are knitting
the vintage American Moss Stitch pattern.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.859
Studio Knit subscriber Renee recently asked
about the difference between the Seed Stitch

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:27.519
and the Moss Stitch. So, the British Moss
Stitch is the same as the Seed Stitch, but

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:34.379
the American Moss Stitch is a bit different.
It knits up and lays beautifully flat, making

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:43.250
this a great stitch for a scarf or blanket.
We begin by Casting on an ODD number of stitches,

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:50.940
so, for example, I have 17 stitches on my
needle. The American Moss STITCH pattern is

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:58.199
knit in a repeated series of four rows. So,
to demonstrate, I am going to switch to my

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:10.700
purple yarn and we begin by knitting one,
and purling one. And we continue the knit

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:21.780
one purl one here on row one all the way down
the row. We will finish up with one Knit One

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:37.170
stitch. Now, on row two, we begin with a Purl
Stitch, so it's purl one and then knit one,

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:46.909
continuing Purl One Knit One all the way our
row and then we will end with one purl one

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:55.479
stitch. Right here. Awesome! So, now row three,
exactly the same as row two, we begin with

00:01:55.479 --> 00:02:04.210
purl one, then knit one purl one knit one
all the way down the row, finishing up with

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:16.120
purl one. And here on row four, it's the same
as row one. It's knit one and purl one the

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:26.360
series knit one purl one down the row and
we finish with a knit one. So beautiful. Oh,
