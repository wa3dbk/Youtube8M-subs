more<00:00:40.200> our<00:00:40.829> admission<00:00:41.340> as<00:00:41.489> Isis<00:00:41.969> where<00:00:42.809> it

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
more our admission as Isis where it

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.139 
more our admission as Isis where it
feels<00:00:43.079> slightly<00:00:43.440> in<00:00:43.680> advance<00:00:44.040> of<00:00:44.309> variability

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
feels slightly in advance of variability

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.150 
feels slightly in advance of variability
and<00:00:45.629> it<00:00:45.750> remains<00:00:46.289> so<00:00:46.559> that<00:00:46.800> you<00:00:46.950> know<00:00:47.010> it's<00:00:47.100> a

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
and it remains so that you know it's a

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:57.070 
and it remains so that you know it's a
good<00:00:47.340> thing<00:00:47.489> it's<00:00:47.850> as<00:00:47.969> hungry

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:57.080 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:00.110 

we<00:00:58.080> have<00:00:58.260> a<00:00:58.340> sort<00:00:59.340> of<00:00:59.370> a<00:00:59.430> world<00:00:59.670> view<00:00:59.910> I<00:00:59.970> think

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
we have a sort of a world view I think

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.910 
we have a sort of a world view I think
that<00:01:00.830> these<00:01:01.830> days<00:01:02.130> you<00:01:02.550> know<00:01:02.670> all<00:01:02.850> chefs<00:01:03.150> do

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:03.920 
that these days you know all chefs do

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.130 
that these days you know all chefs do
but<00:01:04.920> it's<00:01:05.430> it's<00:01:05.640> still<00:01:05.910> about<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.600> ingredient

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
but it's it's still about the ingredient

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.470 
but it's it's still about the ingredient
found<00:01:07.460> week<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:08.700> best<00:01:08.970> possible<00:01:09.180> ingredients

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:09.480 
found week the best possible ingredients

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:14.210 
found week the best possible ingredients
that<00:01:09.930> we<00:01:10.020> can<00:01:10.340> we<00:01:11.340> try<00:01:11.580> to<00:01:11.660> amplify<00:01:12.660> the<00:01:13.220> the

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
that we can we try to amplify the the

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.950 
that we can we try to amplify the the
best<00:01:14.900> the<00:01:15.900> aspects<00:01:16.380> of<00:01:16.500> each<00:01:16.650> ingredient<00:01:17.960> sort

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
best the aspects of each ingredient sort

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.210 
best the aspects of each ingredient sort
of<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.110> bring<00:01:19.320> them<00:01:19.470> to<00:01:19.650> some<00:01:19.890> point<00:01:20.070> of

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
of the bring them to some point of

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.950 
of the bring them to some point of
unnatural<00:01:20.700> discretion<00:01:21.530> the<00:01:23.960> technique

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
unnatural discretion the technique

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.570 
unnatural discretion the technique
themselves<00:01:25.620> which<00:01:25.740> is<00:01:25.890> where<00:01:26.070> the<00:01:26.190> fashion

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
themselves which is where the fashion

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.290 
themselves which is where the fashion
partner<00:01:27.060> comes<00:01:27.330> in<00:01:27.830> that's<00:01:28.830> basically<00:01:29.790> is

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:30.300 
partner comes in that's basically is

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:32.150 
partner comes in that's basically is
underneath<00:01:30.780> ingredients<00:01:31.560> at<00:01:31.740> a<00:01:31.830> subliminal

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:32.160 
underneath ingredients at a subliminal

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:34.430 
underneath ingredients at a subliminal
so<00:01:32.640> this<00:01:32.820> may<00:01:33.030> I<00:01:33.270> don't<00:01:33.600> want<00:01:33.720> any<00:01:33.869> ego<00:01:34.170> to<00:01:34.229> be

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:34.440 
so this may I don't want any ego to be

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.050 
so this may I don't want any ego to be
on<00:01:34.560> the<00:01:34.650> plate<00:01:34.920> I<00:01:34.950> want<00:01:35.280> things<00:01:35.550> to<00:01:35.759> look<00:01:35.790> as

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
on the plate I want things to look as

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.410 
on the plate I want things to look as
natural<00:01:36.240> as<00:01:36.570> possible<00:01:37.220> and<00:01:38.220> obviously<00:01:38.640> some

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
natural as possible and obviously some

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.469 
natural as possible and obviously some
of<00:01:39.509> the<00:01:39.570> things<00:01:39.810> don't<00:01:40.110> occur<00:01:41.060> in<00:01:42.060> nature<00:01:42.119> like

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
of the things don't occur in nature like

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.740 
of the things don't occur in nature like
the<00:01:42.899> dishes<00:01:43.410> say<00:01:43.790> King<00:01:44.790> oyster<00:01:44.910> mushroom<00:01:45.570> and

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
the dishes say King oyster mushroom and

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.380 
the dishes say King oyster mushroom and
ever<00:01:45.840> learning<00:01:46.110> but<00:01:46.470> there<00:01:47.190> are<00:01:47.310> visit<00:01:48.119> on<00:01:48.330> the

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
ever learning but there are visit on the

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.300 
ever learning but there are visit on the
plate<00:01:48.840> and<00:01:49.050> there's<00:01:49.229> if<00:01:49.380> there's<00:01:49.410> synergies

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
plate and there's if there's synergies

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.800 
plate and there's if there's synergies
that<00:01:50.340> you<00:01:50.700> can<00:01:50.850> achieve<00:01:50.970> if<00:01:51.390> you<00:01:51.509> know<00:01:51.660> what

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
that you can achieve if you know what

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.780 
that you can achieve if you know what
you're<00:01:51.930> doing<00:01:52.200> Victor<00:01:52.649> I<00:01:52.950> wanted<00:01:53.460> a<00:01:53.520> scene

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
you're doing Victor I wanted a scene

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.910 
you're doing Victor I wanted a scene
like<00:01:53.820> that<00:01:54.000> they<00:01:54.540> could<00:01:54.780> exist<00:01:55.050> in<00:01:55.229> nature<00:01:55.440> I

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
like that they could exist in nature I

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.320 
like that they could exist in nature I
think<00:01:56.340> because<00:01:56.460> we're<00:01:56.759> a<00:01:56.790> small<00:01:57.119> restaurant

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:57.330 
think because we're a small restaurant

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:00.620 
think because we're a small restaurant
