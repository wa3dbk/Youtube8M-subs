00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.300 
some one person said it wasn't accurate
and<00:02:09.420> you<00:02:10.229> mean<00:02:10.410> it<00:02:10.679> doesn't<00:02:10.979> have<00:02:11.100> to<00:02:11.280> be

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
and you mean it doesn't have to be

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.510 
and you mean it doesn't have to be
completely<00:02:12.350> one<00:02:13.350> hundred<00:02:13.380> percent<00:02:13.680> accurate

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
completely one hundred percent accurate

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.190 
completely one hundred percent accurate
you<00:02:15.030> just<00:02:15.209> have<00:02:15.330> to<00:02:15.360> get<00:02:15.570> the<00:02:15.690> same<00:02:15.930> look

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
you just have to get the same look

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.180 
you just have to get the same look
that's<00:02:16.560> all<00:02:16.709> I'm<00:02:16.830> aiming<00:02:17.250> for<00:02:18.560> he<00:02:19.560> said<00:02:19.860> he

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
that's all I'm aiming for he said he

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.960 
that's all I'm aiming for he said he
would<00:02:20.340> use<00:02:20.550> a<00:02:20.690> urethane<00:02:22.700> polyurethane<00:02:23.700> or

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
would use a urethane polyurethane or

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:25.820 
would use a urethane polyurethane or
latex<00:02:24.420> or<00:02:24.630> something<00:02:24.990> like<00:02:25.110> that<00:02:25.170> yet<00:02:25.680> he's

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
latex or something like that yet he's

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.890 
latex or something like that yet he's
ever<00:02:26.070> like<00:02:26.370> I<00:02:26.670> don't<00:02:27.300> think<00:02:27.420> he's<00:02:27.600> have<00:02:27.780> you

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
ever like I don't think he's have you

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.310 
ever like I don't think he's have you
used<00:02:28.260> it<00:02:28.440> but<00:02:29.720> it<00:02:30.720> doesn't<00:02:30.959> really<00:02:31.050> matter

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.320 
used it but it doesn't really matter

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.050 
used it but it doesn't really matter
because<00:02:31.560> it's<00:02:31.739> just<00:02:32.130> as<00:02:32.430> long<00:02:32.550> as<00:02:32.700> I<00:02:32.790> had<00:02:32.940> to

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
because it's just as long as I had to

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.290 
because it's just as long as I had to
look<00:02:33.209> it<00:02:33.390> was<00:02:33.450> what<00:02:33.720> I'm<00:02:33.810> going<00:02:34.110> for<00:02:34.310> and<00:02:35.310> I

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
look it was what I'm going for and I

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:44.010 
look it was what I'm going for and I
like<00:02:36.720> this<00:02:36.930> pleather<00:02:37.440> works<00:02:38.250> with<00:02:38.459> me

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:44.020 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:48.150 

yeah<00:02:45.020> this<00:02:45.440> was<00:02:45.590> really<00:02:45.890> hard<00:02:46.100> to<00:02:46.160> put<00:02:46.430> on

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160 
yeah this was really hard to put on

pleather the plastic polyurethane all
that<00:02:51.230> all<00:02:51.830> works<00:02:52.310> my<00:02:53.060> method<00:02:53.450> is<00:02:53.480> pleather

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
that all works my method is pleather

00:02:54.200 --> 00:03:01.420

around<00:02:54.710> the<00:02:55.690> padding<00:03:00.040> just<00:03:01.040> saw<00:03:01.100> how<00:03:01.250> many

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
around the padding just saw how many

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:04.090 
around the padding just saw how many
times<00:03:01.640> I<00:03:01.760> had<00:03:01.910> to<00:03:01.940> do<00:03:02.210> this<00:03:02.800> just<00:03:03.800> to<00:03:03.860> get<00:03:03.980> it

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:04.100 
times I had to do this just to get it

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:07.690 
times I had to do this just to get it
right<00:03:04.310> I<00:03:04.690> think<00:03:05.690> that<00:03:05.720> I<00:03:05.900> can<00:03:06.550> did<00:03:07.550> you

using<00:03:20.230> a<00:03:21.230> polyurethane<00:03:22.540> the<00:03:23.540> type<00:03:24.110> of<00:03:24.140> liquid

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 
using a polyurethane the type of liquid

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:27.190 
using a polyurethane the type of liquid
that<00:03:25.459> basic<00:03:25.940> plastic<00:03:26.209> or<00:03:26.630> rubbery<00:03:26.930> substance
