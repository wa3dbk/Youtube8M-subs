softer light but as you can see it's
very<00:01:18.840> very<00:01:19.259> dark<00:01:19.560> my<00:01:20.130> suspicions<00:01:20.700> about<00:01:20.790> the

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
very very dark my suspicions about the

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.880 
very very dark my suspicions about the
thickness<00:01:21.299> of<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:21.630> cup<00:01:21.930> I<00:01:22.080> think<00:01:22.380> approved

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
thickness of the cup I think approved

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.310 
thickness of the cup I think approved
accurate<00:01:23.430> because<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:24.570> light<00:01:24.780> is<00:01:24.810> escaping

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
accurate because the light is escaping

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.870 
accurate because the light is escaping
the<00:01:25.590> cup<00:01:25.830> and<00:01:26.040> it's<00:01:26.159> going<00:01:26.430> out<00:01:26.580> in<00:01:26.729> all<00:01:26.850> sorts

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
the cup and it's going out in all sorts

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.030 
the cup and it's going out in all sorts
of<00:01:27.150> directions<00:01:27.240> but<00:01:28.140> there's<00:01:28.320> no<00:01:28.500> white<00:01:28.740> walls

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
of directions but there's no white walls

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.789 
of directions but there's no white walls
to<00:01:29.310> bounce<00:01:29.640> some<00:01:30.000> of<00:01:30.150> it<00:01:30.270> back<00:01:30.540> that<00:01:31.380> is<00:01:31.530> a<00:01:31.560> very

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
to bounce some of it back that is a very

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.240 
to bounce some of it back that is a very
very<00:01:31.950> dark<00:01:32.280> image<00:01:32.610> indeed<00:01:33.740> I'm<00:01:34.740> not<00:01:35.070> going<00:01:35.189> to

00:03:58.189 --> 00:03:58.199 
off into forever now you might be

00:03:58.199 --> 00:03:59.629 
off into forever now you might be
thinking<00:03:58.349> Mike<00:03:58.769> that's<00:03:58.919> absolute<00:03:59.430> nonsense

00:03:59.629 --> 00:03:59.639 
thinking Mike that's absolute nonsense

00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:01.309

the<00:03:59.969> reason<00:04:00.269> it<00:04:00.359> look<00:04:00.449> better<00:04:00.569> indoors<00:04:01.049> is

00:04:01.309 --> 00:04:01.319 
the reason it look better indoors is

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:04.300 
the reason it look better indoors is
because<00:04:02.009> there<00:04:02.519> were<00:04:02.609> some<00:04:02.790> lights<00:04:03.180> indoors

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:04.310 
because there were some lights indoors

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:06.740 
because there were some lights indoors
let's<00:04:05.310> just<00:04:05.519> check<00:04:05.729> that<00:04:05.790> one<00:04:06.090> out<00:04:06.120> shall<00:04:06.569> we

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
let's just check that one out shall we

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:12.800

light works and how it rattles around

then<00:06:45.870> you<00:06:46.020> can<00:06:46.200> begin<00:06:46.320> to<00:06:46.470> control<00:06:46.919> it<00:06:47.100> to<00:06:47.340> get

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:47.490 
then you can begin to control it to get

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:50.210 
then you can begin to control it to get
