00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:39.850 
Disk Utility click on it just let it

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:43.040 
Disk Utility click on it just let it
gather<00:00:40.030> disconfirmation<00:00:41.760> you<00:00:42.760> go<00:00:42.910> to

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
gather disconfirmation you go to

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.050 
gather disconfirmation you go to
macintosh<00:00:44.050> or<00:00:44.410> whatever<00:00:44.890> hard<00:00:45.640> drive<00:00:45.910> you

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:46.060 
macintosh or whatever hard drive you

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:50.220 
macintosh or whatever hard drive you
want<00:00:46.150> to<00:00:46.330> fleet<00:00:47.290> this<00:00:47.470> thing<00:00:47.710> off<00:00:47.860> you<00:00:49.050> then<00:00:50.050> go

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:50.230 
want to fleet this thing off you then go

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:53.700 
want to fleet this thing off you then go
to<00:00:50.290> a<00:00:50.470> race<00:00:50.830> and<00:00:51.840> they<00:00:52.840> do<00:00:53.020> the<00:00:53.200> race<00:00:53.350> free

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:53.710 
to a race and they do the race free

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:57.060 
to a race and they do the race free
space<00:00:54.100> and<00:00:54.510> then<00:00:55.510> you<00:00:55.690> just<00:00:55.930> go<00:00:56.380> to<00:00:56.860> the

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:57.070 
space and then you just go to the

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:00.120 
space and then you just go to the
fastest<00:00:57.670> so<00:00:57.880> like<00:00:58.470> completely<00:00:59.470> eliminates<00:00:59.950> it

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:00.130 
fastest so like completely eliminates it

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:03.330 
fastest so like completely eliminates it
all<00:01:00.250> and<00:01:00.490> they<00:01:00.970> do<00:01:01.030> erase<00:01:01.870> free<00:01:02.200> free<00:01:03.040> space

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:03.340 
all and they do erase free free space

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:06.660 
all and they do erase free free space
and<00:01:03.960> then<00:01:04.960> I'll<00:01:05.079> just<00:01:05.289> do<00:01:05.439> this<00:01:05.619> will<00:01:06.490> just

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:06.670 
and then I'll just do this will just

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:08.730 
and then I'll just do this will just
create<00:01:06.969> it<00:01:07.060> I'll<00:01:07.570> just<00:01:07.630> search<00:01:08.259> the<00:01:08.289> entire

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:08.740 
create it I'll just search the entire

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:12.239 
create it I'll just search the entire
computer<00:01:09.549> and<00:01:10.140> look<00:01:11.140> see<00:01:11.380> you<00:01:11.439> ticket<00:01:11.829> says<00:01:12.070> it

00:01:12.239 --> 00:01:12.249 
computer and look see you ticket says it

00:01:12.249 --> 00:01:13.800 
computer and look see you ticket says it
takes<00:01:12.429> one<00:01:12.759> minute<00:01:12.939> but<00:01:13.240> then<00:01:13.359> I'll<00:01:13.479> increase

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:13.810 
takes one minute but then I'll increase

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:18.450 
takes one minute but then I'll increase
slowly<00:01:14.109> increased<00:01:14.999> five<00:01:16.020> ten<00:01:17.020> it's<00:01:17.829> like<00:01:17.950> 30

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:18.460 
slowly increased five ten it's like 30

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:21.270 
slowly increased five ten it's like 30
it'll<00:01:19.299> take<00:01:19.509> OC<00:01:20.140> it'll<00:01:20.319> take<00:01:20.469> 30<00:01:20.679> minutes<00:01:20.979> but

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:21.280 
it'll take OC it'll take 30 minutes but

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.440 
it'll take OC it'll take 30 minutes but
it<00:01:21.880> takes<00:01:22.119> around<00:01:22.560> roughly<00:01:23.880> 45<00:01:24.880> minutes<00:01:25.210> to<00:01:25.359> an

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:25.450 
it takes around roughly 45 minutes to an

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.859 
it takes around roughly 45 minutes to an
hour<00:01:25.569> just<00:01:26.530> to<00:01:26.649> like<00:01:27.179> to<00:01:28.179> finish<00:01:28.390> this<00:01:28.509> process

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:28.869 
hour just to like to finish this process

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:30.840 
hour just to like to finish this process
because<00:01:29.380> it's<00:01:29.560> searching<00:01:30.429> throughout<00:01:30.700> your

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:30.850 
because it's searching throughout your

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:33.809 
because it's searching throughout your
whole<00:01:31.179> hard<00:01:31.509> drive<00:01:31.600> and<00:01:32.079> if<00:01:32.649> you<00:01:33.189> about<00:01:33.369> larger

00:01:33.809 --> 00:01:33.819 
whole hard drive and if you about larger

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:36.629 
whole hard drive and if you about larger
heart<00:01:34.060> see<00:01:34.270> I<00:01:34.299> only<00:01:34.539> have<00:01:34.630> to<00:01:34.810> be<00:01:34.899> at<00:01:35.639> 285

00:01:36.629 --> 00:01:36.639 
heart see I only have to be at 285

00:01:36.639 --> 00:01:39.419 
heart see I only have to be at 285
gigabyte<00:01:37.210> hard<00:01:37.389> drive<00:01:37.509> so<00:01:38.409> like<00:01:38.530> if<00:01:38.679> it's<00:01:38.889> just

00:01:39.419 --> 00:01:39.429 
gigabyte hard drive so like if it's just

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:43.050 
gigabyte hard drive so like if it's just
for<00:01:39.729> example<00:01:40.119> say<00:01:40.270> 1<00:01:40.600> terabyte<00:01:40.990> hard<00:01:41.350> drive<00:01:42.060> it

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:43.060 
for example say 1 terabyte hard drive it

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.020 
for example say 1 terabyte hard drive it
should<00:01:43.420> take<00:01:43.899> up<00:01:44.049> maybe<00:01:44.319> I<00:01:44.679> should<00:01:45.399> say<00:01:45.700> a

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.030 
should take up maybe I should say a

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:48.870 
should take up maybe I should say a
couple<00:01:46.450> maybe<00:01:46.810> a<00:01:46.990> day<00:01:47.200> or<00:01:47.439> so<00:01:47.709> just<00:01:48.490> could<00:01:48.729> be<00:01:48.759> a

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:48.880 
couple maybe a day or so just could be a

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.749 
couple maybe a day or so just could be a
hard<00:01:49.119> drive<00:01:49.359> space<00:01:49.920> so<00:01:50.920> I'm<00:01:51.340> pretty<00:01:51.549> should

00:01:51.749 --> 00:01:51.759 
hard drive space so I'm pretty should

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:54.989 
hard drive space so I'm pretty should
done<00:01:51.969> this<00:01:52.149> so<00:01:52.530> I'm<00:01:53.530> just<00:01:53.649> gonna<00:01:53.829> skip<00:01:54.189> and

00:01:54.989 --> 00:01:54.999 
done this so I'm just gonna skip and

00:01:54.999 --> 00:01:56.639 
done this so I'm just gonna skip and
yeah<00:01:55.149> it<00:01:55.359> just<00:01:55.389> should<00:01:55.719> end<00:01:56.020> off<00:01:56.200> like<00:01:56.469> that

00:01:56.639 --> 00:01:56.649 
yeah it just should end off like that

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:00.330 
yeah it just should end off like that
and<00:01:57.359> all<00:01:58.359> those<00:01:58.869> use<00:01:59.109> of<00:01:59.319> spirals<00:01:59.920> left<00:02:00.219> in

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:00.340 
and all those use of spirals left in

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.209 
and all those use of spirals left in
your<00:02:00.429> thing<00:02:00.729> will<00:02:01.270> be<00:02:01.420> gone<00:02:01.630> I<00:02:01.950> hope<00:02:02.950> you<00:02:03.039> guys

00:02:03.209 --> 00:02:03.219 
your thing will be gone I hope you guys

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:05.300 
your thing will be gone I hope you guys
