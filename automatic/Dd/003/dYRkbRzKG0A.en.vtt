00:00:10.379 --> 00:00:13.379
 O 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.750
 it is practically impossible 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:28.750
 is that it in part of a concept 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:33.860
 that party preservation of forest similar situation 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:37.689
 and noting this situation we will still be 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.220
 and this information will 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.480
 the 15 years of 

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:43.870
 passing through 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:46.870
 without sugar in perception 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:50.550
 and the object itself at its end 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:54.940
 will fly in us who teaches us in this process then all concepts 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:56.610
 that appears here 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.990
 aesthetics the construction 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:02.990
 of the circus 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.100
 displacement of the object in question 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.100
 basically 

00:02:10.439 --> 00:02:13.189
 listening observation 

00:02:13.189 --> 00:02:14.479
 I read a lot 

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:17.479
 delivery and opening for 

00:02:18.439 --> 00:02:22.369
 What you feel I draw I let you leave this month 

00:02:22.369 --> 00:02:25.369
 logically this is very difficult to talk about scorsese field 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:30.099
 basically I can talk about work 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:10.240
 each 

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.510
