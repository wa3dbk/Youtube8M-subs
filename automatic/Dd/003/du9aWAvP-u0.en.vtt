today<00:00:12.330> we're<00:00:12.570> going<00:00:12.660> to<00:00:12.780> be<00:00:12.840> talking<00:00:13.200> about

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:13.260 
today we're going to be talking about

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:15.590 
today we're going to be talking about
fan<00:00:13.769> belts<00:00:14.160> or<00:00:14.369> in<00:00:14.670> this<00:00:14.789> case<00:00:15.000> we<00:00:15.270> call<00:00:15.480> this

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:15.600 
fan belts or in this case we call this

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.870 
fan belts or in this case we call this
one<00:00:15.779> a<00:00:15.809> serpentine<00:00:16.379> belt<00:00:16.439> the<00:00:17.250> reason<00:00:17.550> we<00:00:17.670> call

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
one a serpentine belt the reason we call

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.060 
one a serpentine belt the reason we call
it<00:00:17.910> that<00:00:18.090> is<00:00:18.270> because<00:00:18.840> this<00:00:19.109> actually<00:00:19.380> snakes

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
it that is because this actually snakes

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:21.890 
it that is because this actually snakes
around<00:00:20.310> all<00:00:20.760> the<00:00:20.939> different<00:00:21.269> components<00:00:21.779> in

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
around all the different components in

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.200 
around all the different components in
the<00:00:22.019> engine<00:00:22.439> like<00:00:22.890> a<00:00:22.920> snake<00:00:23.280> so<00:00:23.760> we<00:00:23.880> call<00:00:24.060> it<00:00:24.090> a

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
the engine like a snake so we call it a

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.689 
the engine like a snake so we call it a
serpentine<00:00:24.720> belt<00:00:24.980> the<00:00:25.980> belt<00:00:26.190> needs<00:00:26.400> to<00:00:26.580> be

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
serpentine belt the belt needs to be

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.939 
serpentine belt the belt needs to be
replaced<00:00:27.090> periodically<00:00:27.630> usually<00:00:28.560> about

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
replaced periodically usually about

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.580 
replaced periodically usually about
every<00:00:29.430> four<00:00:30.240> to<00:00:30.360> six<00:00:30.390> years<00:00:30.900> depending<00:00:31.260> on<00:00:31.500> the

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
every four to six years depending on the

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.770 
every four to six years depending on the
conditions<00:00:32.149> how<00:00:33.149> do<00:00:33.210> you<00:00:33.359> know<00:00:33.510> when<00:00:33.660> your

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
conditions how do you know when your

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.720 
conditions how do you know when your
belt<00:00:33.989> needs<00:00:34.170> to<00:00:34.350> be<00:00:34.440> replaced<00:00:34.829> outside<00:00:35.550> of

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
belt needs to be replaced outside of

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.369 
belt needs to be replaced outside of
just<00:00:35.850> the<00:00:35.969> age<00:00:36.210> of<00:00:36.539> it<00:00:36.660> some<00:00:36.989> things<00:00:37.230> will

00:00:37.369 --> 00:00:37.379 
just the age of it some things will

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:39.290 
just the age of it some things will
happen<00:00:37.620> to<00:00:37.859> a<00:00:37.890> belt<00:00:38.160> over<00:00:38.309> time<00:00:38.640> and<00:00:38.820> primarily

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
happen to a belt over time and primarily

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.959 
happen to a belt over time and primarily
it<00:00:39.539> gets<00:00:39.719> dried<00:00:40.079> out<00:00:40.260> and<00:00:40.499> cracked<00:00:40.949> so<00:00:41.609> here<00:00:41.850> we

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
it gets dried out and cracked so here we

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.079 
it gets dried out and cracked so here we
have<00:00:42.120> a<00:00:42.149> belt<00:00:42.479> that's<00:00:42.749> very<00:00:43.050> badly<00:00:43.409> cracked

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:44.089 
have a belt that's very badly cracked

00:00:44.089 --> 00:00:47.540 
have a belt that's very badly cracked
these<00:00:45.089> cracks<00:00:45.479> come<00:00:45.780> from<00:00:46.050> age<00:00:46.319> and<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:47.249> heat

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
these cracks come from age and the heat

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.549 
these cracks come from age and the heat
is<00:00:48.120> extreme<00:00:48.659> heat<00:00:48.929> in<00:00:48.960> the<00:00:49.260> engine

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
is extreme heat in the engine

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.319 
is extreme heat in the engine
compartment<00:00:49.589> and<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.370> rubber<00:00:50.609> deteriorates

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
compartment and the rubber deteriorates

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.419 
compartment and the rubber deteriorates
you<00:00:51.989> can<00:00:52.170> see<00:00:52.319> this<00:00:52.469> is<00:00:52.679> the<00:00:52.799> side<00:00:52.979> of<00:00:53.129> the<00:00:53.219> belt

00:00:53.419 --> 00:00:53.429 
you can see this is the side of the belt

00:00:53.429 --> 00:00:54.919 
you can see this is the side of the belt
that<00:00:53.609> would<00:00:53.699> normally<00:00:53.819> be<00:00:54.089> driving<00:00:54.809> the

00:00:54.919 --> 00:00:54.929 
that would normally be driving the

00:00:54.929 --> 00:00:57.139 
that would normally be driving the
components<00:00:55.559> this<00:00:56.129> is<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.399> back<00:00:56.609> side<00:00:56.940> of<00:00:56.969> the

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
components this is the back side of the

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:57.469 
components this is the back side of the
belt

00:00:57.469 --> 00:00:57.479 
belt

00:00:57.479 --> 00:01:01.669 
belt
so<00:00:57.929> as<00:00:58.139> this<00:00:58.440> wears<00:00:58.829> out<00:00:59.629> as<00:01:00.629> it<00:01:00.929> gets<00:01:01.139> old<00:01:01.409> and

00:01:01.669 --> 00:01:01.679 
so as this wears out as it gets old and

00:01:01.679 --> 00:01:03.559 
so as this wears out as it gets old and
dry<00:01:01.889> it's<00:01:02.219> going<00:01:02.309> to<00:01:02.549> crack<00:01:02.819> and<00:01:03.089> get<00:01:03.179> brittle

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:03.569 
dry it's going to crack and get brittle

00:01:03.569 --> 00:01:05.180 
dry it's going to crack and get brittle
and<00:01:03.690> eventually<00:01:04.140> this<00:01:04.290> belt<00:01:04.589> will<00:01:04.769> actually

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:05.190 
and eventually this belt will actually

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:06.859 
and eventually this belt will actually
break<00:01:05.489> you<00:01:05.700> can<00:01:05.850> see<00:01:06.119> right<00:01:06.330> now<00:01:06.540> where<00:01:06.780> it

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
break you can see right now where it

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.620 
break you can see right now where it
just<00:01:06.990> wants<00:01:07.380> to<00:01:07.409> snap<00:01:07.890> to<00:01:08.549> be<00:01:08.670> sold<00:01:09.180> and<00:01:09.390> dried

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
just wants to snap to be sold and dried

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.440 
just wants to snap to be sold and dried
out<00:01:09.890> if<00:01:10.890> this<00:01:11.130> bill<00:01:11.370> were<00:01:11.400> to<00:01:11.700> break<00:01:11.910> your

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
out if this bill were to break your

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.330 
out if this bill were to break your
vehicle<00:01:12.900> would<00:01:12.960> wind<00:01:13.200> up<00:01:13.320> stalling<00:01:13.710> it<00:01:14.130> would

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
vehicle would wind up stalling it would

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.280 
vehicle would wind up stalling it would
overheat<00:01:14.910> your<00:01:15.360> alternator<00:01:15.870> would<00:01:16.050> stop

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
overheat your alternator would stop

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.080 
overheat your alternator would stop
working<00:01:16.770> your<00:01:16.950> power<00:01:17.130> steering<00:01:17.550> would<00:01:17.820> stop

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
working your power steering would stop

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.060 
working your power steering would stop
working<00:01:18.360> and<00:01:18.750> you'd<00:01:19.230> probably<00:01:19.440> be<00:01:19.710> stranded

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
working and you'd probably be stranded
