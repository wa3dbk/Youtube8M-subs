00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:09.719
 in short, we wish him to do as he did 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:11.700
 other traitors ronaldo ibra that maybe 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.460
 score a goal in the derby 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:19.680
 then after the final result is for i 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:22.710
 nerazzurri 1 over cavour and this holds 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.750
 always from the office of the inter however 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.880
 wanting alive and less for action not 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.099
 her faith too hypocritical 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:34.739
 unwavering for those millions I am 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:39.960
 Inter as ever because he likes me 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:43.559
 like it still will need in white is 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:46.680
 one thing you do jig about for one thing were 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:49.920
 six years that a theater step if in the 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.570
 yours in your scan of years 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.460
 of time now what will come the cinema 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.579
 after he returns to the cinema after he returns to the 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:59.640
 center and therefore how it works like if 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:03.359
 you have finished more what you do write 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:06.750
 to start throwing ideas 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:09.840
 in my opinion the scheme begins the cinema 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:12.750
 in writing because then say that there 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.689
 he is saying that he is already afraid of coffee 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.250
 pedrocchi has ideas if a real one 

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:20.070
 from the cheerfulness of guard did not depart 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.840
 even before in Florence from a restaurant 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.200
 a little bit of himself because he is ugly 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:27.090
 but the city was in this restaurant 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:29.280
 great restaurant and we found ourselves 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.740
 with the film team being 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.720
 trembling at the idea found I find the idea 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.579
 the voice of the truth of this 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.710
 last week your asked 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.970
 you have already thought little tenth version 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.799
 after summer 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.899
 no but it is true that he then found us at 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.829
 florence we have formed the team we are 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:46.799
 the three of us 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:49.680
 valerio bariletti pasquale plastino ee 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:52.079
 walter fountain and they will work with us 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.220
 and we said then let's start 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.960
 in May yes yes yes 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.000
 and from there we have ordered 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.640
 ate drunk the suggestion trade 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.120
 of one but let it grow 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:04.280
 no but if we could talk about mass 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:08.149
 who cares committee thrown look at them 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:13.790
 Christmas 2014 Christmas 2014 both for which the 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:18.970
 first century antonio for which we say that 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:18.970
 the Mayans came in 2013 at the end of 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:25.420
 interpretation and but theater does not 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:32.360
 you would do theater again in 2018 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:34.640
 so sure with the 2020 television in 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:38.540
 which of you three who will vote the most likes 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:41.230
 do theater that keeps us all three 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:44.269
 like doing this in this theater 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:45.860
 this shift was mine hosting a 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:47.720
 little bit for the theater though 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:49.430
 basically it did n't take that long for 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:53.510
 which why pushed for the theater 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:56.660
 but because I think you always need to 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:58.430
 going in alternate phases also because what 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:59.780
 we could have made yet another movie 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:04.250
 after Christmas no, according to me there 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:05.720
 take a break from that free sector 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:08.299
 to make theater also because the theater 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:11.720
 somehow it gives us the chance to 

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:16.160
 strengthen the alchemy which it does not give 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:20.600
 cinema because cinema is the spot 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:22.130
 written and after that the fi in the five 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:24.910
 minutes you can do it again ten times 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:27.049
 etc. however, that alchemy is missing 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:31.340
 daily in which to do does the same thing 

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:33.260
 and produces cinema is a little different for 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:40.459
 many verses the most beautiful thing of the 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:43.790
 tour what it is if there is one to visit 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:46.790
 the cities that is we say we have already done 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:49.970
 many years ago, however, with another spirit 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:53.299
 so now review in the cities below 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:54.079
 another on another mentality is a lot 

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:57.170
 Interesting 

00:03:54.079 --> 00:04:01.280
 There is only for the past 40 series that you are 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:03.310
 around if we can more bank at home 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:05.180
 yes every so often I ask sorry guys 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:07.099
 reported in the theater 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:09.200
 I feel a little guilty because I pushed 

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:10.700
 because I actually starts now 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:12.290
 to be a little harder after he had 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:14.209
 made fifty networks which is not here but 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:16.760
 because beryllium is the southern e 

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:19.549
 comfortable there is he does the tour yields for 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:21.979
 he brings his wife his mouth 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:23.090
 show brings the next dog 

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:25.010
 Do you understand 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:28.220
 there is the desire that uses his wife 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:29.960
 great beautiful wife the wife at the scene 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:32.510
 wife in sheva silvana fallisi 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:34.669
 a good actress and so on and so on though 

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:36.979
 lack and choose and change course 

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:40.250
 also yesterday for the truth that a 

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:46.190
 torino there is the dog you could see the 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:48.470
 dog in milan that not the sky however i 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:51.890
 cats are more difficult to bear 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:54.979
 the airports behind him and behind the scenes 

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:59.210
 he hears the actor's voice and we have it 

00:04:54.979 --> 00:05:01.010
 left on stage twice a 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:04.539
 blunder 

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:04.539
 yes, not yet, yet 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:12.250
 is a clear path room actor 

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:14.289
 if you ever think about doing those things there 

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:16.180
 people always make rankings of all 

00:05:14.289 --> 00:05:17.889
 best places where soldiers on vacation 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:21.520
 the admonished I like best 

00:05:17.889 --> 00:05:23.710
 read girlfriends and boyfriends of 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:26.800
 your sketches and your lines 

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:30.190
 I believe your ranking has rite 

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:33.009
 drafted as a personal hero but then it is 

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:37.120
 so that in incorporating all the great 

00:05:33.009 --> 00:05:40.030
 writer nick horby has been changing for half an hour 

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:42.639
 in half an hour then our top five of 

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:45.039
 these strange this moment if I had to 

00:05:42.639 --> 00:05:48.130
 say the three best sketches that years 

00:05:45.039 --> 00:05:52.930
 5 in the work, however, is for brevity we do 

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:56.110
 three would say first the car then the 

00:05:52.930 --> 00:06:00.159
 according to I would say 

00:05:56.110 --> 00:06:03.759
 the three twins and the third I would say the 

00:06:00.159 --> 00:06:06.610
 art gallery which twins retro in the 

00:06:03.759 --> 00:06:09.190
 heart of the courts where he will be remembered 

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:12.190
 we are 3 cabbage three days the first 

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:15.580
 show we have 

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:17.660
 if the concierge there is the concierge then 

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:20.660
 precisely we are attached to this 

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:24.200
 agreement does not let me down but not there 

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:28.790
 let's remember to create the car machines 

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:35.960
 but classic key to make Swiss yes 

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:36.940
 call b lux and the movie you have yours 

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:39.830
 favorite movie 

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:43.040
 now touch the ranking every sketch 

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:45.950
 what I am and however conditioned by 

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:49.790
 from the public because maybe when you 

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:51.380
 turn for example the second one 

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:51.860
 what i liked most is what it is 

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:57.980
 the life 

00:06:51.860 --> 00:07:00.020
 think however from the point of the public it is not 

00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:01.250
 the brace of a lifetime has done well 

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:02.660
 but what he did best in 

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:05.420
 absolute was ask me if I'm happy 

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:07.760
 from the point of view of the receipts of the 

00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:17.840
 visibility then between a leg that is 

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:20.060
 started with 40 copies and then I discovered 

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:21.260
 today I wondered if washed turned in 

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:23.300
 Puglia of shot in Rome 

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:28.310
 everything was born around Rome 

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:31.640
 two films all in Rome in the Palermo area 

00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:34.340
 ask me if I'm happy but to terracina 

00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:37.880
 at dinner this is maybe the jacket 

00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:40.670
 there remains bad says cynthia we remember 

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:42.980
 already in the crust of Sicily it is instead ad 

00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:45.200
 be nesting land which is also then 

00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:47.960
 to look for all those scenes of 

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:51.170
 film the legend of al john and jack where 

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:54.620
 aldo hangs on this New York bill 

00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:56.680
 we are in a "bruzzano" winning a wall 

00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:59.420
 rebuilt completely rebuilt 

00:07:56.680 --> 00:08:02.600
 we were a month in there on your 

00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:07.280
 warm and aldo erap imbragato mica 

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:09.950
 harness goes well the berio thank you

00:08:09.950 --> 00:08:13.430
 I'm on tour in Italy with a wetsuit 

00:08:11.570 --> 00:08:16.330
 music thanks served to visit us 

00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:16.330
 rationing
