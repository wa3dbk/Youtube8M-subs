00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
and you just start covering a mold like

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.530 
and you just start covering a mold like
that<00:02:03.619> the<00:02:04.619> key<00:02:04.829> to<00:02:04.860> this<00:02:05.130> is<00:02:05.430> the<00:02:06.119> worse<00:02:06.329> it

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
that the key to this is the worse it

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.029 
that the key to this is the worse it
looks<00:02:06.750> the<00:02:07.049> better<00:02:07.229> it's<00:02:07.439> going<00:02:07.649> to<00:02:07.740> look<00:02:07.799> in

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
looks the better it's going to look in

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.650 
looks the better it's going to look in
the<00:02:08.160> end<00:02:08.340> the<00:02:08.700> more<00:02:08.879> it's<00:02:09.030> going<00:02:09.149> to<00:02:09.209> replicate

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
the end the more it's going to replicate

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.090

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:38.350 
tell if you look right there that I have

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:42.710

ordinary<00:02:40.170> ordinary<00:02:41.170> newspaper<00:02:42.010> underneath

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
ordinary ordinary newspaper underneath

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.660

when<00:02:43.720> I<00:02:43.750> first<00:02:44.020> made<00:02:44.200> this<00:02:44.350> mask<00:02:44.620> it<00:02:44.950> really

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
when I first made this mask it really

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:48.270 
when I first made this mask it really
didn't<00:02:46.360> have<00:02:46.480> a<00:02:46.690> really<00:02:47.080> good<00:02:47.200> grin<00:02:47.620> to<00:02:48.040> it<00:02:48.190> I

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:59.090 
very good knife and I hacked away at it
it<00:02:56.080> really<00:02:56.800> gives<00:02:57.070> it<00:02:57.250> that<00:02:57.280> kind<00:02:57.790> of<00:02:57.910> like

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
it really gives it that kind of like

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:02.550

really cruel look to it so when you make

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.850 
really cruel look to it so when you make
it<00:03:02.770> also<00:03:03.520> with<00:03:04.150> the<00:03:04.270> nose<00:03:04.450> you<00:03:05.290> don't<00:03:05.320> want<00:03:05.770> to

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:05.860 
it also with the nose you don't want to

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:07.560

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:11.740 
try to make it as round

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:13.830 
try to make it as round
I<00:03:11.800> took<00:03:11.860> cardboard<00:03:12.520> and<00:03:12.610> I<00:03:12.730> made<00:03:12.940> it<00:03:12.970> so<00:03:13.720> it

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 
I took cardboard and I made it so it

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.840 
I took cardboard and I made it so it
goes<00:03:13.990> over<00:03:14.050> the<00:03:14.440> nose<00:03:14.590> in<00:03:14.950> a<00:03:15.010> very<00:03:15.250> round<00:03:15.610> like

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:15.850 
goes over the nose in a very round like

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:18.900 
goes over the nose in a very round like
way<00:03:16.440> and<00:03:17.440> then<00:03:17.650> after<00:03:18.160> I<00:03:18.190> made<00:03:18.370> everything<00:03:18.760> I

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:18.910 
way and then after I made everything I

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:21.810 
way and then after I made everything I
didn't<00:03:19.780> cut<00:03:20.170> out<00:03:20.290> the<00:03:20.410> eyes<00:03:20.530> and<00:03:20.920> then<00:03:21.010> as<00:03:21.700> soon

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:21.820

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.130 
as I got all this formed I let it dry

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:26.280 
as I got all this formed I let it dry
overnight<00:03:24.430> and<00:03:24.790> I<00:03:25.540> came<00:03:25.810> back<00:03:25.840> and<00:03:26.170> I<00:03:26.260> looked

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:28.500 
overnight and I came back and I looked
at<00:03:26.680> a<00:03:26.740> picture<00:03:26.950> of<00:03:27.130> the<00:03:27.400> movie<00:03:27.730> and<00:03:27.940> I<00:03:28.120> cut<00:03:28.390> the

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
at a picture of the movie and I cut the

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:30.960 
at a picture of the movie and I cut the
eyes<00:03:28.630> out<00:03:28.930> as<00:03:29.170> I<00:03:29.470> drew<00:03:30.190> him<00:03:30.310> in<00:03:30.430> and<00:03:30.610> I<00:03:30.640> cut<00:03:30.850> him

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:30.970 
eyes out as I drew him in and I cut him

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:33.390 
eyes out as I drew him in and I cut him
out<00:03:31.060> after<00:03:31.660> that<00:03:32.080> I<00:03:32.320> took<00:03:32.440> the<00:03:33.250> orange

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
out after that I took the orange

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:34.710 
out after that I took the orange
construction<00:03:34.000> paper<00:03:34.180> and<00:03:34.390> I<00:03:34.450> started

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 
construction paper and I started

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:38.070 
construction paper and I started
covering<00:03:34.900> it<00:03:35.700> I<00:03:36.700> covered<00:03:37.150> it<00:03:37.420> and<00:03:37.630> then<00:03:38.050> I

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:38.080 
covering it I covered it and then I

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:42.000 
covering it I covered it and then I
found<00:03:38.560> out<00:03:38.800> the<00:03:39.040> mask<00:03:39.220> was<00:03:39.430> way<00:03:39.640> too<00:03:40.860> large<00:03:41.860> for

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
found out the mask was way too large for

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:44.699 
found out the mask was way too large for
my<00:03:42.280> face<00:03:42.520> so<00:03:43.030> what<00:03:43.180> I<00:03:43.209> did<00:03:43.390> was<00:03:43.600> in<00:03:44.440> order<00:03:44.530> to

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:44.709 
my face so what I did was in order to

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:47.910 
my face so what I did was in order to
make<00:03:44.860> it<00:03:45.010> skinnier<00:03:45.520> I<00:03:45.660> put<00:03:46.660> pasted<00:03:47.560> all<00:03:47.890> over

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:47.920 
make it skinnier I put pasted all over
