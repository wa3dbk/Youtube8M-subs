00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:21.840
 two bad panamera and then the so-called against hajduk variant the 

00:00:21.839 --> 00:00:24.390
 first plug in porsche hard drugs 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:30.650
 under the hood is the well-known three-liter v6 petrol with supercharger and that alive 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:35.690
 of itself already capacity of 333 hp and as such first someone there already 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:36.339
 a while 

00:00:36.339 --> 00:00:38.220
 known from the panamera 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:41.210
 porsche is now adding an electric motor to it 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:44.789
 and who is fed from a large battery 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:49.100
 who says in the luggage room that naturally has its consequences because 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.469
 as a result, the luggage space at vandenbergh follows a decline 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.870
 bz panamera was not that well known for its huge benefits on it 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:58.830
 plan 

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:02.609
 thanks for this version of course to drive as economically as possible 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.680
 at least that is the message that Porsche wants to give 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.130
 Young his office is also stated I can take my turn 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.970
 and that becomes then 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:25.780
 the om staying in that color green that come among other things on that 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:29.700
 nameplates may also continue at sunrise new variant 

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:33.490
 anp not to forget with this copy the calipers 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:36.490
 though we think that goes a bit too far 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:54.630
 the real hefty will know on this side of the car-free Sunday this 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.190
 panamera is not just an ordinary variant but it is her turn because of this 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.050
 additional 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:04.050
 find that newspaper cover 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.420
 it can be set even crazier 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:27.589
 behind the electrically open tailgate 

00:02:27.589 --> 00:02:31.609
 syn wurk a luggage space from the floor is a lot higher 

00:02:31.609 --> 00:02:34.329
 That's because the battery 

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:35.830
 behind the rear axle 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:37.639
 illuminate hundreds of candles 

00:02:37.639 --> 00:02:40.399
 so that levy kim space 

00:02:40.399 --> 00:02:44.909
 in the luggage compartment, see here a chance that there will be outside of it 

00:02:45.869 --> 00:02:47.789
 for the normal outlet 

00:02:47.789 --> 00:02:50.859
 and then the so-called menneke strong who got into the car 

00:02:51.679 --> 00:02:53.190
 between the two strong sentences 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.790
 I'm in the rain on the way with that 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:58.400
 how many antwerp are determined by the user 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.969
 the car is disconnected from the mains 

00:03:00.969 --> 00:03:03.069
 it is, of course, secure 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:07.359
 and easy to load the car at the charging station over charging points 

00:03:07.359 --> 00:03:10.279
 and before that 

00:03:10.279 --> 00:03:11.439
 plugs out 

00:03:11.439 --> 00:03:14.439
 included 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:27.950
 It would of course not surprise anyone that for shirt has it all in order 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:31.000
 that right in this the panamera he became 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:33.549
 in the position 

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:34.599
 the hybrid 

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:38.149
 that we have not found before at any other place in the new one 

00:03:38.149 --> 00:03:39.329
 namely here 

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:42.559
 central control was switched on and that was on the initiative 

00:03:43.689 --> 00:03:47.640
 with that the car turns later while driving 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:48.939
 the gasoline engine 

00:03:48.939 --> 00:03:52.839
 let him run the action m that lasts if you go on a normal course on the 

00:03:52.839 --> 00:03:56.650
 speed this not much longer than about 45 minutes and then it is 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:02.219
 current volendam can in practice come with reasonable temperatures around 28 

00:04:02.219 --> 00:04:05.519
 discovered kilometers are driven completely electrically 

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:09.209
 Of course Andy battery also simply charges a power outlet such as one 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:10.469
 passport 

00:04:10.469 --> 00:04:14.429
 and with that the radiesse electric action is maximized 

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:19.819
 on the basis of which the zeeuw time also sets the newspaper kilometers from emesa 

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:23.400
 the average consumption measured from 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.879
 one in 32 in Halle 

00:04:25.879 --> 00:04:29.240
 first of course.nu music that is locked up 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:33.090
 in the way we use the armored vehicle of an altimeter in europe 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.960
 so in practice, that is certainly not going to be 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:39.960
 you have to use this car if you use it regularly 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:44.139
 that time therefore seems too late a possibility and a maximum seems to be the action radius 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:49.060
 still count on around one in thirteen halfway through 14 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:50.410
 but that the photo 

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:54.220
 this size and of this weight of the week not yet 21 100 kilos 

00:04:54.979 --> 00:04:57.370
 325 pounds more 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:02.120
 then the panamera with this v6 engine martens without this addition 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:05.120
 is that very reasonable 

00:05:06.449 --> 00:05:08.610
 cherry on the ferry 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:09.809
 for the buyer 

00:05:09.809 --> 00:05:10.990
 naturally does not apply 

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:13.990
 fourteen percent addition 

00:05:33.629 --> 00:05:33.939
