00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:26.210
 before showing us this incredible fight 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:28.849
 we spent two previous chapters very 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:33.290
 good guys from the saga naruto shippuden talked 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:34.790
 of chapters 418 and 419 two beautiful 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:38.059
 chapters that I highly recommend 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:39.890
 see since these are very emotional and of 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:42.110
 source of inspiration where we are 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:44.540
 shows the past of guy sensei next to 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:46.370
 your father mike todd guy which I can 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:48.320
 say with certainty that he is a father 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.500
 exemplary and a role model but it is 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.940
 best known for being the internal gene 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:55.129
 before talking about this great fight 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:57.230
 that was deliver and kill I would like 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:59.539
 clarify certain things regarding the power 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:01.670
 de maite day and talk about the great 

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:03.440
 ninja who was remember that I do not 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.420
 like to give personal opinions 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.190
 I like to give answers with facts 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:09.619
 have to say things that only leave the 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:12.020
 imagination to the users if they are of 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:13.820
 agreement seems fine and if not how it is 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.950
 but I like to leave things 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:18.469
 clear, let's start 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:20.360
 there is a small controversy regarding the 

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:22.159
 old power when this one faced 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:25.009
 the seven swordsmen of the mist 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:27.380
 let's see some believe that he only killed 

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:29.719
 three or four or who killed them all or 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.670
 that simply left them badly wounded and 

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:33.619
 that this one was just a level ninja well 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:37.159
 and it is impossible that he killed them 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:39.200
 everyone already killed them and almost everyone leaving 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:41.390
 to only one with life which was the 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.000
 carrier of same jada on which I base myself 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.740
 to say this is simple all 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.569
 swordsmen of the fog make their 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.459
 appearance in the fourth world war 

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:51.560
 Chinese Vico Credo Ten has it left 

00:01:49.459 --> 00:01:54.229
 perfectly to understand that all of them 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:56.810
 they were killed if they had continued with 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:59.299
 life these would have appeared worth the 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:01.220
 redundancy alive at certain times of 

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:03.770
 history and dying in another way that 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:05.899
 it was not for his fight against die and 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:08.000
 then I will tell you why I heal streak suc 

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:10.579
 and he appears alive and being killed by 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.829
 Naruto first of all the saga 

00:02:10.579 --> 00:02:15.410
 where that character appears is filled 

00:02:12.829 --> 00:02:17.750
 he was never seen in the manga until just 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:19.790
 a while ago where he shows it together 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.670
 with the other six swordsmen and up 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:24.230
 it's just time the character was canon 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.000
 as in the manga they showed us 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:28.160
 events of your life more 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.440
 specifically in the battle against 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.360
 Naruto refutes that he survived 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:34.489
 the battle against the and I give them a 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.440
 suggestion to the anime do not consider it 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:38.690
 not at all when it comes to debating 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:41.480
 bassens in the manga and only seen it in 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:43.670
 the sleeve although clear naruto of lascivious 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:45.709
 mobile mourning are canon stories because 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:47.420
 kishimoto the author did the whole script and 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:50.540
 the characters that appear in those 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:53.480
 movies now mai all and really 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:55.400
 He was a gaming level ninja , as he was 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:58.550
 until he managed to master the eight doors 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:01.130
 internal chakra may be heard a 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:03.260
 little inflated but my all and had all 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:05.390
 the qualities to be a jockey since 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:07.549
 he was powerful and a human being full of 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:09.799
 values ​​since it is well known that for 

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:11.870
 being hockey is not only necessary the power 

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:13.720
 It is also necessary to have qualities 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:16.790
 very human and inspirational 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:18.830
 to give an idea of ​​his power kaka if a 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:20.810
 young elite and his team had 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:22.730
 difficulties to defeat the seven 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:24.890
 swordsmen of the mist and who have 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:27.049
 gone tense and it is not an excuse since also 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:28.940
 they had sealing ninjas and a large group 

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:30.860
 from junin to your help 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:33.140
 while my all and being alone 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:34.850
 he killed six swordsmen but of course 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:36.560
 coast of his own life when opening the 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:39.110
 eighth door of the eight doors 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:41.080
 internal and that feat is something that only 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:43.760
 I would achieve a level ninja I loaded 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:45.770
 then follow and release the seventh door 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:48.800
 would have the same level that joined a 

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:51.170
 inexperienced in the case of gaia al 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:53.830
 open the eight internal doors this 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:56.630
 has the equivalent power to 100 streets 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:58.460
 clarifying all this I can give way to the 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:01.670
 criticism of the chicken fight give to 

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:04.070
 ricky 2 just great this battle 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:05.990
 first he will give me he looks very confident but 

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:08.510
 Take the cca and started with the best 

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:10.820
 beating of all naruto and that hardly 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:12.800
 we have a part of the whole fight already 

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:15.350
 missing yet to see more techniques 

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:17.359
 part of guy and obvious as soon as the 

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:19.989
 second part of this great fight in the 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:22.730
 anime for part 2 of this review 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:24.710
 It should be noted that when the guy activates the 

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:27.350
 eighth door this releases a steam 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:29.780
 reddish but what some do not know is 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:32.060
 what is love is not chakra is blood 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:33.740
 of bay and this one is expelled out of her 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:35.510
 body due to the enormous pressure that 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:37.400
 suffers inside 

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:39.410
 and is willing to sacrifice his life 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:41.420
 to be the source of youth of the 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:43.580
 new green and young leaves in 

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:46.460
 reference to romney and all 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:48.710
 important people for guy but 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:50.510
 thanks to all those sacrifices guy 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:53.300
 attacked wood with the series of blows 

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:55.310
 called x show consists of hitting the 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:57.620
 enemy with powerful trucks of air 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:59.510
 formed solely by physical force 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:01.520
 from guy just give a blow to this 

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:03.530
 magnitude caused enormous damage in the 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:05.930
 guy's body fracturing his bones 

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:08.090
 but that did not matter to him and he continued with the 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:09.820
 fight and these powerful attacks caused 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:11.870
 craters on the battlefield 

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:14.180
 causing great harm to kill 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:16.310
 we can also notice in this chapter a 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:18.260
 a sadley rowley to see his 

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:20.210
 teacher enduring great pain for 

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.350
 activate the eighth door and being at 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:23.420
 edge of death 

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:26.000
 malara already felt something cornered and 

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:28.040
 the excited time said it is the second 

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.140
 Once you feel so much emotion in combat 

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:32.120
 the first time was in the battle against 

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:34.760
 his lifelong rival hasina more in 

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:36.620
 joe and in this fight we not only see 

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:38.780
 great techniques and blows 

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:41.810
 He also had a strategy on behalf of 

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:44.389
 minato giving instructions to almost face 

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:46.220
 to attack and support guy looking 

00:05:44.389 --> 00:05:48.110
 generate an opening so he could 

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:50.990
 hit him with the last attack of the 

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:52.940
 series is the quiz show at the end we can 

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:55.190
 see although there is something exhausted and a mandara 

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:57.700
 excited for the fight but I repeat 

00:05:55.190 --> 00:06:00.620
 this is just the beginning of the battle 

00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:02.630
 I was very excited to see this fight 

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:04.820
 in anime and that's not all we can 

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:06.740
 see in this chapter for the first time 

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:08.570
 appears enrique those hemming the 

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:10.820
 ancestor of all the ninjas and is 

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:13.130
 creator of nin show talking with naruto 

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:15.139
 in a weird dialect the same naruto does not 

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:17.000
 I understood what he said xd 

00:06:15.139 --> 00:06:18.979
 in the end the rich though managed to talk about 

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.960
 such a way Naruto understood what 

00:06:18.979 --> 00:06:23.120
 what I was saying explained why 

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:24.950
 they have to stop wood since this is 

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:27.320
 a great threat and that naruto is 

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:29.780
 descendant of his youngest son ashura the 

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:32.060
 which was not born privileged with powers to 

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:34.850
 difference from his brother indra which 

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:36.919
 reincarnated sas who explained why 

00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:39.169
 I put ashura as successor and not his 

00:06:36.919 --> 00:06:40.880
 brother indra since ashura was a guy 

00:06:39.169 --> 00:06:43.190
 who knew that the way of the true 

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:45.590
 strength is through aid and 

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:48.030
 mutual companionship a way of love and 

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:50.280
 of compression while Indra was 

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:53.040
 otherwise he thought that power was the 

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:55.020
 that should rule the world in order 

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:56.820
 I loved this chapter 

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:59.430
 if I could rate it I would give a 

00:06:56.820 --> 00:07:01.920
 deserved 10 of 10 inclusive the animation 

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:04.490
 I thought the characters were good 

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:06.600
 better drawn and everything was more fluid 

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:08.970
 I hope you liked this video 

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:11.370
