00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:09.860
 hello everyone today I 

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:12.260
 will show you how to fix a 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:14.930
 resin tab that was broken so there 

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:16.430
 I will spend the tip of my help 

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:17.750
 so rather than redo it 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:18.699
 fully i'm going to show you a 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:21.280
 little trick 

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:24.020
 so we could take a chablon 

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:26.360
 to put it underneath with the avs in 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:31.369
 doing exactly the same shape but he 

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:33.559
 there will always be a drop at the edge 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:36.050
 will never happen propped well 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:39.260
 put the chaff we stick it well 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:42.649
 against the nail so me my tip is 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:43.789
 to use this cycle it's a roll I 

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:46.069
 do not know what it's actually called 

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:48.829
 it's a species danut stickers that 

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:49.969
 find yourself casteau caste or 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:52.690
 do-it-yourself stores would have in 

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:52.690
 plumbing 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:59.510
 mine is fine enough finally I find it 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:01.489
 too little rigid enough ad that I have 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:01.850
 done is that I cut them in the 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:04.790
 length 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:06.409
 here and I stuck both parties one 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.979
 on the other which makes it a lot 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:08.979
 more rigid 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:17.240
 So that's my little trick 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:24.320
 so here I cut out a small 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:26.650
 piece i'm going to remove the tape 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.650
 self-adhesive 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:38.640
 I want to come the pass is often 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:38.640
 lambelin so I fold it 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.729
 I come that the collar 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:00.479
 mouss 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:06.960
 and then just come back 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:09.270
 the resin that I had used so in this 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:12.560
 that concerns me it was resin that 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:14.760
 there was only colored monomer in purple 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:20.640
 I had kept my monomer residue 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:24.060
 so I can use the same for that 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:26.750
 it's the same color and I'm coming 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.750
 redo my complaint 

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:38.190
 I tell you that here I am 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:40.670
 to do with the left hand this little 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.670
 easy 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:05.860
 obviously I recreate the art well is in 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:05.860
 the extension of the one I already have 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.490
 so that's about good I have more 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:21.020
 to wait until it dries now 

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:25.850
 once these 5 1 I will remove my 

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:28.120
 little aluminum paper that sticks very very 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:28.120
 well 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.500
 that's what it gives below you 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:41.600
 see there is no village the all 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:47.150
 small to the limit 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:47.150
 now I have more than punct mill 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:55.270
 and here is the nail repaired I have left 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:57.940
 more than to put a little bit of a 

00:03:55.270 --> 00:04:00.550
 little shot blues finish and it's 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:01.960
 finished hopefully this tutorial will have been you 

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:04.620
 useful and I tell you see you soon 

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:04.620
 ciao
