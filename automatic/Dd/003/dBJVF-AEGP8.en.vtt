to show you the v6 and the v6 GT

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.150 
to show you the v6 and the v6 GT
innovative<00:00:17.340> new<00:00:17.520> mounting<00:00:17.939> bracket<00:00:19.160> first

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
innovative new mounting bracket first

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.019 
innovative new mounting bracket first
this<00:00:20.340> is<00:00:20.490> the<00:00:20.550> entire<00:00:20.880> unit<00:00:22.460> this<00:00:23.460> one<00:00:23.730> bracket

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
this is the entire unit this one bracket

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.100 
this is the entire unit this one bracket
is<00:00:24.300> compatible<00:00:24.869> with<00:00:24.930> in<00:00:25.259> cell<00:00:25.669> 775<00:00:26.899> 1156<00:00:27.899> and

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:28.110 
is compatible with in cell 775 1156 and

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:31.220 
is compatible with in cell 775 1156 and
1366<00:00:29.099> and<00:00:29.369> simple<00:00:30.180> adjustments<00:00:30.750> on<00:00:30.869> the<00:00:31.020> top

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
1366 and simple adjustments on the top

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.979 
1366 and simple adjustments on the top
and<00:00:31.500> the<00:00:31.950> bottom<00:00:32.279> to<00:00:32.430> allow<00:00:32.790> for<00:00:33.300> universal

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
and the bottom to allow for universal

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.459 
and the bottom to allow for universal
compatibility<00:00:34.789> so<00:00:35.789> this<00:00:35.969> is<00:00:36.149> the<00:00:36.469> universal

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
compatibility so this is the universal

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:42.560 
compatibility so this is the universal
bracket<00:00:38.399> for<00:00:38.670> the<00:00:38.969> v6<00:00:39.149> and<00:00:39.629> a<00:00:39.750> v6<00:00:39.930> GT<00:00:41.329> this<00:00:42.329> is

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
bracket for the v6 and a v6 GT this is

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.640 
bracket for the v6 and a v6 GT this is
the<00:00:43.199> Intel<00:00:44.180> supporting<00:00:45.180> top<00:00:45.360> mount<00:00:45.660> so<00:00:46.590> you

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:46.650 
the Intel supporting top mount so you

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:50.030 
the Intel supporting top mount so you
can<00:00:46.890> see<00:00:47.160> that<00:00:47.940> we've<00:00:48.120> adjusted<00:00:48.329> this<00:00:48.930> to<00:00:49.110> 1366

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:50.040 
can see that we've adjusted this to 1366

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.810 
can see that we've adjusted this to 1366
and<00:00:50.520> it's<00:00:51.210> adjustable<00:00:51.899> to<00:00:52.230> 1150<00:00:53.040> six<00:00:53.430> of<00:00:53.640> seven

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
and it's adjustable to 1150 six of seven

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.569 
and it's adjustable to 1150 six of seven

seven five seven seven five is closest

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.020 
seven five seven seven five is closest
to<00:00:56.610> the<00:00:56.760> CPU<00:00:57.239> socket<00:00:57.690> 1366<00:00:58.440> is<00:00:59.250> farthest<00:01:00.000> away

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
to the CPU socket 1366 is farthest away

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.380 
to the CPU socket 1366 is farthest away
for<00:01:00.780> purposes<00:01:01.230> of<00:01:01.290> example<00:01:02.130> we<00:01:02.340> have<00:01:02.760> adjusted

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
for purposes of example we have adjusted

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.889 
for purposes of example we have adjusted
the<00:01:04.049> sides<00:01:04.409> differently<00:01:05.189> to<00:01:05.579> show<00:01:06.149> you<00:01:06.210> that

00:01:06.889 --> 00:01:06.899 
the sides differently to show you that

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:11.840 
the sides differently to show you that
one<00:01:07.680> bracket<00:01:08.100> can<00:01:08.219> be<00:01:08.369> used<00:01:08.610> for<00:01:08.850> 775<00:01:09.270> or<00:01:10.850> 1366

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
one bracket can be used for 775 or 1366

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.660 
one bracket can be used for 775 or 1366
but<00:01:12.689> it<00:01:13.200> is<00:01:13.350> very<00:01:13.560> important<00:01:14.070> to<00:01:14.219> note<00:01:14.430> that

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
but it is very important to note that

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.849 
but it is very important to note that
when<00:01:15.090> you<00:01:15.180> are<00:01:15.210> assembling<00:01:15.569> the<00:01:15.990> CPU<00:01:16.560> and<00:01:16.799> the

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:05.260 
retention bracket so I'm going to use
the<00:03:01.510> 1366<00:03:02.510> mounting<00:03:03.500> hole<00:03:04.010> and<00:03:04.340> I'm<00:03:04.970> going<00:03:05.210> to

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:05.270 
the 1366 mounting hole and I'm going to

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:08.140 
the 1366 mounting hole and I'm going to
remove<00:03:05.660> the<00:03:05.930> current<00:03:06.260> configuration<00:03:07.150> which

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
remove the current configuration which

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:16.050 
remove the current configuration which
is<00:03:11.260> 1156

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:19.020 

so<00:03:16.630> you<00:03:16.690> can<00:03:16.900> see<00:03:17.140> now<00:03:17.440> I'm<00:03:17.620> in<00:03:17.800> the<00:03:18.100> 1366

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
so you can see now I'm in the 1366

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:21.199 
so you can see now I'm in the 1366
mounting<00:03:19.420> location<00:03:19.900> both<00:03:20.080> for<00:03:20.319> the<00:03:20.410> pin<00:03:20.620> and

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
mounting location both for the pin and

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:24.960 
mounting location both for the pin and
for<00:03:22.209> the<00:03:22.360> screw<00:03:22.600> hole<00:03:22.780> so<00:03:23.500> once<00:03:24.190> I<00:03:24.370> have<00:03:24.670> one<00:03:24.880> of

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
for the screw hole so once I have one of

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.960 
for the screw hole so once I have one of
the<00:03:25.090> sides<00:03:25.360> adjusted<00:03:25.930> for<00:03:26.130> 1366<00:03:27.130> I<00:03:27.370> will<00:03:27.819> have

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970 
the sides adjusted for 1366 I will have

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:29.960 
the sides adjusted for 1366 I will have
to<00:03:28.120> do<00:03:28.270> the<00:03:28.420> same<00:03:28.660> thing<00:03:28.930> for<00:03:29.140> the<00:03:29.260> screws<00:03:29.620> on

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
to do the same thing for the screws on

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:33.390 
to do the same thing for the screws on
each<00:03:30.970> of<00:03:31.270> the<00:03:31.390> four<00:03:31.720> corners<00:03:32.230> of<00:03:32.380> the<00:03:32.470> inter

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
each of the four corners of the inter

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.699 
each of the four corners of the inter
retention<00:03:33.880> bracket<00:03:34.270> this<00:03:34.690> corner<00:03:35.050> and<00:03:35.200> the

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:35.709 
retention bracket this corner and the

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:43.320 
retention bracket this corner and the
other<00:03:35.860> two<00:03:36.100> quarters<00:03:41.220> but<00:03:42.220> for<00:03:42.489> example<00:03:42.610> we're

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:43.330 
other two quarters but for example we're

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:46.309 
other two quarters but for example we're
going<00:03:43.600> to<00:03:43.750> move<00:03:43.989> to<00:03:44.020> rewards<00:03:44.620> attaching<00:03:45.489> the

00:06:18.879 --> 00:06:23.309 
the V in this situation we're blowing
out<00:06:19.080> so<00:06:20.159> the<00:06:21.159> v6<00:06:21.729> GT<00:06:22.300> is<00:06:22.479> correctly<00:06:22.899> aligned

00:06:23.309 --> 00:06:23.319 
out so the v6 GT is correctly aligned
