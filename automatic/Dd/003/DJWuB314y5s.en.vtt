00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
go kind of had to break that a little

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.960 
go kind of had to break that a little
bit<00:01:08.820> and<00:01:09.060> so<00:01:09.330> basically<00:01:09.570> I<00:01:10.020> am<00:01:10.380> in<00:01:10.710> this<00:01:11.070> land

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
bit and so basically I am in this land

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.750 
bit and so basically I am in this land
this<00:01:12.240> magma<00:01:12.659> land<00:01:13.080> and<00:01:13.320> I<00:01:14.159> am<00:01:14.280> just<00:01:14.490> going<00:01:14.670> to

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
this magma land and I am just going to

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.090 
this magma land and I am just going to
fly<00:01:15.180> around<00:01:15.390> and<00:01:15.930> I<00:01:16.439> will<00:01:16.680> show<00:01:17.040> you

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.219 
fly around and I will show you
everything<00:01:17.369> that<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:18.270> magma<00:01:18.600> land<00:01:18.810> provides

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
everything that the magma land provides

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.219 
everything that the magma land provides
for<00:01:19.470> you<00:01:19.560> and<00:01:19.970> first<00:01:20.970> off<00:01:21.270> as<00:01:21.509> you<00:01:21.810> can<00:01:21.930> see

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
for you and first off as you can see

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.130 
for you and first off as you can see
there<00:01:22.979> is<00:01:23.009> this<00:01:23.460> a<00:01:23.700> different<00:01:24.060> grass<00:01:24.540> and<00:01:24.900> this

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
there is this a different grass and this

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.450 
there is this a different grass and this
grass<00:01:25.590> is<00:01:25.890> called<00:01:26.520> the<00:01:27.530> magma<00:01:28.530> grass<00:01:28.829> and<00:01:29.250> then

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
grass is called the magma grass and then

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.300 
grass is called the magma grass and then
there<00:01:29.610> is<00:01:29.729> also<00:01:29.909> magma<00:01:30.659> stone<00:01:30.990> magma<00:01:31.979> dirt

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
there is also magma stone magma dirt

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.940 
there is also magma stone magma dirt
magma<00:01:33.240> planks<00:01:33.810> logs<00:01:34.530> and<00:01:34.979> leaves<00:01:35.700> and<00:01:36.530> so<00:01:37.530> it

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
magma planks logs and leaves and so it

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.789 
magma planks logs and leaves and so it
just<00:01:38.009> adds<00:01:38.369> a<00:01:38.490> whole<00:01:38.610> different<00:01:39.090> world<00:01:39.210> as<00:01:39.799> you

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
just adds a whole different world as you

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.219 
just adds a whole different world as you
can<00:01:40.920> see<00:01:41.220> it<00:01:41.640> is<00:01:41.820> nighttime<00:01:42.060> and<00:01:42.600> look<00:01:42.930> at<00:01:43.049> that

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
can see it is nighttime and look at that

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.200 
can see it is nighttime and look at that
giant<00:01:43.740> moon<00:01:44.040> it<00:01:44.340> will<00:01:44.490> always<00:01:44.670> stay<00:01:44.820> night

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
giant moon it will always stay night

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.450 
giant moon it will always stay night
time<00:01:45.479> except<00:01:46.290> it<00:01:46.409> is<00:01:46.530> a<00:01:46.619> bit<00:01:46.950> more<00:01:47.130> bright<00:01:47.430> than

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
time except it is a bit more bright than

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.789 
time except it is a bit more bright than
what<00:01:48.149> it<00:01:48.299> normally<00:01:48.329> nighttime<00:01:49.200> normally<00:01:49.649> is

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
what it normally nighttime normally is

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:54.260 
what it normally nighttime normally is
so<00:01:51.229> basically<00:01:52.229> you<00:01:52.500> will<00:01:52.710> see<00:01:53.130> a<00:01:53.159> lot<00:01:53.549> of<00:01:53.579> magma

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
so basically you will see a lot of magma

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.389 
so basically you will see a lot of magma
cubes<00:01:54.750> which<00:01:55.470> is<00:01:55.680> a<00:01:55.710> nice<00:01:56.070> little<00:01:56.369> add-on<00:01:56.729> and

00:01:58.389 --> 00:01:58.399

see these are the trees the a wood that
I<00:02:05.280> showed<00:02:05.909> you<00:02:05.939> right<00:02:06.329> here<00:02:06.689> it<00:02:07.530> is<00:02:07.740> a

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
I showed you right here it is a

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.309 
I showed you right here it is a
nice-looking<00:02:08.220> wood<00:02:09.030> along<00:02:09.479> with<00:02:09.660> the<00:02:09.780> planks

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
nice-looking wood along with the planks

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:13.070 
nice-looking wood along with the planks
the<00:02:10.440> planks<00:02:10.830> do<00:02:11.069> look<00:02:11.400> nice<00:02:11.819> as<00:02:12.209> long<00:02:12.810> with<00:02:12.930> the

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
the planks do look nice as long with the

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.850 
the planks do look nice as long with the
wood<00:02:13.260> and

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
wood and

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.830 
wood and
leaves<00:02:14.040> so<00:02:14.790> it<00:02:14.940> gives<00:02:15.090> that<00:02:15.240> nice<00:02:15.540> little

and<00:02:24.260> along<00:02:25.260> and<00:02:25.880> this<00:02:26.880> this<00:02:27.330> warp<00:02:27.660> this<00:02:27.960> world

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
and along and this this warp this world

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:33.020 
and along and this this warp this world
it<00:02:28.740> does<00:02:29.220> provide<00:02:29.580> a<00:02:29.850> few<00:02:30.210> oars<00:02:30.480> and<00:02:31.790> let's<00:02:32.790> see

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
it does provide a few oars and let's see

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.120 
it does provide a few oars and let's see
if<00:02:33.270> I<00:02:33.450> can<00:02:33.660> dig<00:02:33.840> down<00:02:33.990> and<00:02:34.200> find<00:02:34.380> few<00:02:34.740> oars<00:02:34.980> and

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
if I can dig down and find few oars and

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.770 
if I can dig down and find few oars and
this<00:02:35.400> is<00:02:35.580> the<00:02:35.790> stone<00:02:36.590> the<00:02:37.590> stone<00:02:37.650> of<00:02:38.250> the<00:02:38.280> world

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
this is the stone the stone of the world

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:44.180 
this is the stone the stone of the world
which<00:02:39.780> I<00:02:40.110> believe<00:02:40.380> is<00:02:40.590> that<00:02:40.680> and<00:02:42.170> let<00:02:43.170> me<00:02:43.290> pick

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
which I believe is that and let me pick

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:45.830 
which I believe is that and let me pick
up<00:02:44.370> what<00:02:44.520> the<00:02:44.610> cobblestone<00:02:45.150> looks<00:02:45.390> like<00:02:45.600> and

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
up what the cobblestone looks like and

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.370 
up what the cobblestone looks like and
they<00:02:46.260> have<00:02:46.470> a<00:02:46.709> mossy<00:02:47.190> cobblestone<00:02:47.780> so<00:02:48.780> that<00:02:49.200> is

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
they have a mossy cobblestone so that is

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.500 
they have a mossy cobblestone so that is
the<00:02:49.530> MOSFET<00:02:49.980> mossy<00:02:50.310> cobblestone<00:02:50.730> and<00:02:51.120> that<00:02:51.300> is

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
the MOSFET mossy cobblestone and that is

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.420 
the MOSFET mossy cobblestone and that is
the<00:02:51.720> cobblestone<00:02:52.290> that<00:02:52.530> is<00:02:52.590> it<00:02:52.709> that<00:02:52.980> is<00:02:53.190> what

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
the cobblestone that is it that is what

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.280 
the cobblestone that is it that is what
that<00:02:53.610> looks<00:02:53.850> like<00:02:53.910> and<00:02:54.239> basically<00:02:54.840> I'm<00:02:55.170> not

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
that looks like and basically I'm not

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:56.479 
that looks like and basically I'm not
really<00:02:55.500> going<00:02:55.590> to<00:02:55.680> find<00:02:55.860> the<00:02:55.980> or<00:02:56.160> right<00:02:56.430> now

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489 
really going to find the or right now

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:58.479 
really going to find the or right now
but<00:02:56.820> I'm<00:02:56.910> going<00:02:57.030> to<00:02:57.090> spot<00:02:57.270> it<00:02:57.420> really<00:02:57.600> quick<00:02:57.780> so

00:02:58.479 --> 00:02:58.489 
but I'm going to spot it really quick so

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:03.920 
but I'm going to spot it really quick so
magma<00:02:59.489> coal<00:03:00.300> ore<00:03:00.600> and<00:03:01.370> magma<00:03:02.370> or<00:03:02.610> so<00:03:03.360> let<00:03:03.840> me

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
magma coal ore and magma or so let me

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:06.140 
magma coal ore and magma or so let me
place<00:03:04.140> these<00:03:04.380> two<00:03:04.440> down<00:03:04.890> and<00:03:05.280> get<00:03:05.520> off<00:03:05.760> game

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
place these two down and get off game

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.650 
place these two down and get off game
mode<00:03:06.480> and<00:03:06.980> so<00:03:07.980> I<00:03:08.010> have<00:03:08.489> my<00:03:08.670> diamond<00:03:09.120> pickaxe<00:03:09.480> so

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
mode and so I have my diamond pickaxe so

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:11.630 
mode and so I have my diamond pickaxe so
I<00:03:09.690> will<00:03:09.959> break<00:03:10.110> the<00:03:10.260> magma<00:03:10.650> or<00:03:10.830> and<00:03:11.130> I<00:03:11.280> will<00:03:11.520> get

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
I will break the magma or and I will get

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.270 
I will break the magma or and I will get
a<00:03:11.880> magma<00:03:12.360> and<00:03:12.630> magma<00:03:13.320> is<00:03:13.440> used<00:03:13.709> for<00:03:13.920> tools

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
a magma and magma is used for tools

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.850 
a magma and magma is used for tools
weapons<00:03:14.580> etc<00:03:14.880> to<00:03:15.300> make<00:03:15.420> the<00:03:15.510> portal<00:03:15.900> along

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 
weapons etc to make the portal along

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:20.479 
weapons etc to make the portal along
with<00:03:16.890> the<00:03:17.370> coal<00:03:18.000> the<00:03:18.720> coal<00:03:18.989> or<00:03:19.709> just<00:03:20.190> gives<00:03:20.370> you

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489 
with the coal the coal or just gives you

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:24.890 
with the coal the coal or just gives you
a<00:03:20.519> normal<00:03:20.940> coal<00:03:21.209> and<00:03:21.830> but<00:03:22.830> the<00:03:23.700> cube<00:03:24.030> itself<00:03:24.390> is

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
a normal coal and but the cube itself is

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.940 
a normal coal and but the cube itself is
called<00:03:25.200> the<00:03:25.530> magma<00:03:26.190> coal<00:03:27.150> or<00:03:27.560> but<00:03:28.560> when<00:03:28.709> you<00:03:28.799> do

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
called the magma coal or but when you do

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:30.800 
called the magma coal or but when you do
break<00:03:29.160> it<00:03:29.370> it<00:03:29.549> only<00:03:29.670> gives<00:03:29.940> you<00:03:30.239> a<00:03:30.269> normal

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
break it it only gives you a normal

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.890 
break it it only gives you a normal
piece<00:03:31.350> of<00:03:31.380> coal<00:03:31.799> but<00:03:32.760> anyways<00:03:33.180> guys<00:03:33.360> that<00:03:33.750> is

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
piece of coal but anyways guys that is

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.710 
piece of coal but anyways guys that is
it<00:03:34.110> for<00:03:34.170> this<00:03:34.860> mod<00:03:35.310> it<00:03:36.030> I<00:03:36.269> just<00:03:36.480> thought<00:03:36.570> this
