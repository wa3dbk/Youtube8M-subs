and actually do a second pass and you

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.020 
and actually do a second pass and you
have<00:01:18.420> to<00:01:18.570> maintain<00:01:18.750> a<00:01:19.049> wet<00:01:19.350> edge<00:01:19.560> so<00:01:20.369> we<00:01:20.820> will

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
have to maintain a wet edge so we will

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.670 
have to maintain a wet edge so we will
wait<00:01:21.210> up<00:01:21.360> here<00:01:21.600> with<00:01:21.720> a<00:01:21.810> wet<00:01:21.960> edge<00:01:22.110> here<00:01:22.439> so

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
wait up here with a wet edge here so

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.620 
wait up here with a wet edge here so
what<00:01:23.189> you<00:01:23.310> do<00:01:23.460> is<00:01:23.490> you<00:01:23.640> take<00:01:23.850> your<00:01:24.119> next<00:01:24.420> pass

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
what you do is you take your next pass

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.370 
what you do is you take your next pass
go<00:01:25.140> right<00:01:25.409> into<00:01:25.710> your<00:01:25.890> finish<00:01:26.570> ok<00:01:27.570> and<00:01:27.869> if

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
go right into your finish ok and if
