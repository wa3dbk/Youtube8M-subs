00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:16.090
 hello youtube friends my name is 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:17.920
 David 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:22.290
 well this is my first video tutorial 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:26.410
 in which I will teach you in the first place 

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:30.430
 how to extract the hard drive from a laptop 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:35.500
 in this case it is the toshiba satellite that 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:40.390
 845 in Spanish and secondly they 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:43.770
 I will teach how to transfer the files or 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:47.430
 data or what we want 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:52.050
 from this hard drive or from this laptop to a 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:55.110
 hard drive of a computer or PC 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:58.140
 desktop or vice versa of the hard drive to 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.530
 hard drive and everything we will do through 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.489
 the 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:07.570
 head is good, I'm going to accommodate a 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:12.060
 little here and we come back good with help 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:15.190
 from a screwdriver I removed the 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.979
 screws that you secured on the lid and there 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:20.190
 removed the lid is nothing of the other 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:20.190
 world 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:27.210
 here we are already with memory 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:32.070
 ram with the banks and the hard drive itself 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:34.979
 and what I come here is the reader 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:38.610
 well, we will necessarily have to 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:42.390
 remove the screw that secures a 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:46.380
 reader to be able to withdraw it because we 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:49.920
 it prevents removing the good hard disk 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:55.320
 it only has one screw here what 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:56.900
 we remove and slide back to 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:01.220
 can remove it 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:04.010
 and as following the hard drive also 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:07.510
 has an insurance that is a screw a 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:11.680
 just screw here and 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:16.360
 we removed it and here has a kind of 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:20.320
 handle in the case of toshiba and so we 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:23.200
 makes it easier to slide the hard drive 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:26.560
 to be able to remove it and well what 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:29.010
 we have here and there you can see them on 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:33.689
 power port 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:37.280
 what is the connection sata good already 

00:02:33.689 --> 00:02:37.280
 retired on the hard drive 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:41.940
 we are going 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:44.010
 to condition the cable that so good 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.650
 I'm only going to withdraw from the 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:52.010
 reader of me 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:55.010
 of discs I do not withdraw to be able 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:59.439
 connect it to the hard drive of the 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:03:02.550
 portable once the hard drive is removed 

00:02:59.439 --> 00:03:07.110
 of the laptop 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:12.000
 Once the cables are removed, the 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:12.000
 energy and the sata cables 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:19.019
 we proceed to 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:21.720
 in his works to put them well the cable 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:23.610
 sata has only one sense as they can 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:26.430
 see here the detainee I do not know if they can 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:29.819
 visualize what this is the cable the 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:32.730
 esata connector and here is the socket 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:37.280
 good energy only has a meaning 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:40.330
 and we can not go wrong 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:40.330
 we do not place 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:47.700
 good and now the power socket 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:52.819
 that also only makes sense 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:55.069
 well it was that good 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:04:00.230
 and would already be connected to our disk 

00:03:55.069 --> 00:04:04.690
 hard already connected the power cable and 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:09.430
 the sata that are connected 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:13.580
 to the board on the hard drive of the 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:18.590
 portable on the hard drive d 

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:22.520
 good desktop pc only us 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:25.150
 I would turn on the pc 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:25.150
 good 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:28.800
 when it is lighting 

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:36.050
 we wait a moment 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:36.050
 even if it turns on 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:49.110
 good already turned on the pc what we're going 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:51.820
 now to verify if in fact the 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:56.190
 discs are found 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:56.190
 we see that here are the discs 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:03.350
 we see that there are four positions two of 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:05.250
 the desktop pc and where the laptop 

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:08.090
 ok now what are we going to do 

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:11.090
 transfer the files for that 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:11.090
 we search 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:15.650
 we already have here what the folder of 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:17.650
 videos 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:20.199
 weight 

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:24.100
 they would sit you get good and others that 

00:05:20.199 --> 00:05:25.340
 we here my files and videos 

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:28.180
 videos 

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:28.180
 what we do 

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:34.520
 and nothing more 

00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:39.069
