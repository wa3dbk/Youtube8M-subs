00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
this is what they're calling black latex

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
and super cool this is not quite mad but

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.649 
and super cool this is not quite mad but
it's<00:01:07.710> definitely<00:01:07.950> not<00:01:08.340> glossy<00:01:08.939> either<00:01:09.150> and<00:01:09.479> it

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
it's definitely not glossy either and it

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.990 
it's definitely not glossy either and it
really<00:01:09.930> does<00:01:10.170> look<00:01:10.260> like<00:01:10.470> latex<00:01:10.890> I<00:01:11.220> just<00:01:11.820> think

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
really does look like latex I just think

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.120 
really does look like latex I just think
that's<00:01:12.140> really<00:01:13.140> neat<00:01:13.290> so<00:01:13.439> the<00:01:13.680> key<00:01:13.830> with<00:01:13.979> this

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
that's really neat so the key with this

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.280 
that's really neat so the key with this
it's<00:01:14.280> not<00:01:14.400> putting<00:01:14.640> on<00:01:14.700> a<00:01:14.760> top<00:01:14.970> coat<00:01:15.210> just<00:01:16.140> to

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
it's not putting on a top coat just to

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:17.870 
it's not putting on a top coat just to
get<00:01:16.439> it<00:01:16.530> to<00:01:16.650> stay<00:01:16.920> so<00:01:17.189> I<00:01:17.220> don't<00:01:17.490> know<00:01:17.549> I<00:01:17.580> haven't

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
get it to stay so I don't know I haven't

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.280 
get it to stay so I don't know I haven't
worn<00:01:18.119> this<00:01:18.270> on<00:01:18.420> its<00:01:18.540> own<00:01:18.600> so<00:01:18.659> I<00:01:18.810> don't<00:01:19.020> know<00:01:19.110> how

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
worn this on its own so I don't know how

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.620 
worn this on its own so I don't know how
long<00:01:19.560> it<00:01:19.920> wears<00:01:20.280> because<00:01:20.700> I<00:01:20.790> always<00:01:21.000> put<00:01:21.360> a<00:01:21.420> top

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
long it wears because I always put a top

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.870 
long it wears because I always put a top
coat<00:01:21.930> because<00:01:22.530> it<00:01:22.740> helps<00:01:22.979> the<00:01:23.250> polish<00:01:23.729> is<00:01:23.850> dry

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
coat because it helps the polish is dry

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.240 
coat because it helps the polish is dry
faster<00:01:24.420> so<00:01:24.659> it<00:01:25.320> lasts<00:01:25.650> longer<00:01:25.770> so<00:01:26.100> I<00:01:26.130> don't

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
faster so it lasts longer so I don't

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.020 
faster so it lasts longer so I don't
know<00:01:26.310> how<00:01:26.400> that's<00:01:26.549> going<00:01:26.640> to<00:01:26.729> last<00:01:26.820> but

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:21.100 
in my bombshell box and I think one of

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:23.759 
in my bombshell box and I think one of
those<00:03:21.340> polishes<00:03:21.970> was<00:03:22.180> an<00:03:22.330> add-on<00:03:22.570> but<00:03:23.410> I<00:03:23.530> can't

00:03:23.759 --> 00:03:23.769 
those polishes was an add-on but I can't

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:25.110 
those polishes was an add-on but I can't
remember<00:03:23.860> which<00:03:24.100> one<00:03:24.370> it<00:03:24.610> might<00:03:24.940> have<00:03:25.060> been
