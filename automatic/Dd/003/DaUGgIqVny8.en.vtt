very<00:01:30.990> different<00:01:31.469> experience<00:01:31.770> and<00:01:32.689> I<00:01:33.689> found

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
very different experience and I found

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.319 
very different experience and I found
love<00:01:34.710> in<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:35.130> script<00:01:35.460> and<00:01:35.640> with<00:01:35.789> everyone<00:01:36.179> in

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
love in the script and with everyone in

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.120 
love in the script and with everyone in
this<00:01:36.420> story<00:01:36.720> and<00:01:36.929> I<00:01:37.110> remember<00:01:37.409> our<00:01:37.530> first<00:01:37.799> day

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
this story and I remember our first day

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.609 
this story and I remember our first day
we<00:01:38.369> really<00:01:38.670> sort<00:01:39.030> of<00:01:39.149> hit<00:01:39.780> the<00:01:39.810> ground<00:01:40.170> running

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.730 
we really sort of hit the ground running
and<00:01:40.890> I<00:01:40.950> think<00:01:41.159> I<00:01:41.250> should<00:01:41.520> have<00:01:41.850> my<00:01:42.240> part<00:01:42.659> in<00:01:42.990> the

15<00:02:39.740> setups<00:02:40.190> done<00:02:40.400> today<00:02:40.610> so<00:02:40.970> we're<00:02:41.360> just

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 
15 setups done today so we're just

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:43.600 
15 setups done today so we're just
moving<00:02:41.630> really<00:02:42.020> fast<00:02:42.140> and<00:02:42.650> actually<00:02:43.070> became<00:02:43.550> a

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610 
moving really fast and actually became a

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:46.060 
moving really fast and actually became a
part<00:02:44.060> of<00:02:44.180> the<00:02:44.750> way<00:02:44.930> we<00:02:44.960> made<00:02:45.290> the<00:02:45.440> movie<00:02:45.800> I<00:02:45.830> mean

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:46.070

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:48.340 
part of the way we made the movie I mean
I<00:02:46.250> think<00:02:46.490> it<00:02:46.730> sort<00:02:46.820> of<00:02:46.940> became<00:02:47.240> like<00:02:47.540> the<00:02:47.690> spine

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:48.350 
I think it sort of became like the spine

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:52.690 
I think it sort of became like the spine
of<00:02:48.620> the<00:02:48.650> film<00:02:48.980> was<00:02:49.640> the<00:02:49.880> speed<00:02:50.210> of<00:02:50.390> it<00:02:51.700> all

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
of the film was the speed of it all
