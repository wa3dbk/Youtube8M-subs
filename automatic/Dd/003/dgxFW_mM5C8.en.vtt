00:00:04.233 --> 00:00:09.267
 Military pilots will admire civil aviation pilots for only one reason, civil aviation pilots have flight attendants 

00:00:09.367 --> 00:00:12.300
 We are Luke and Billy, here is "Joining the Stunt Squadron" 

00:00:22.433 --> 00:00:26.267
 Let's review the tasks in the episode. The task of the episode is really quite difficult. 

00:00:26.367 --> 00:00:29.233
 Gold coins are distributed to the winners in this way. 

00:00:29.333 --> 00:00:32.867
 You can find the flight video of the contestant who completed the task as quickly as possible in the description. 

00:00:32.967 --> 00:00:35.267
 In short, everyone has more enthusiasm 

00:00:35.367 --> 00:00:38.567
 And these pilots also got the 1000 gold coins they deserved. 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.733
 The new mission was prepared by a pilot called KorbenDallas90. 

00:00:44.833 --> 00:00:52.000
 He will get 6,000 gold coins, and we will jump on Bristol 146 and fly to Plateau's airspace. 

00:01:27.467 --> 00:01:33.300
 To complete the task as accurately as possible, be sure to read the list of tasks in the description. I wish you all the best! 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:37.300
