become so polluted overpopulated and

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:06.819 
become so polluted overpopulated and
poisonous<00:03:05.150> that<00:03:05.629> we<00:03:05.780> are<00:03:05.930> no<00:03:06.079> longer<00:03:06.290> able<00:03:06.590> to

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:13.210 
dwell here but our Chairman dregg have a
solution<00:03:10.900> we<00:03:11.900> are<00:03:11.930> constructing<00:03:12.470> a<00:03:12.709> pristine

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
solution we are constructing a pristine

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.729 
solution we are constructing a pristine
new<00:03:13.519> world<00:03:13.880> using<00:03:14.419> the<00:03:14.540> choicest<00:03:15.139> planetary

new world using the choicest planetary
components<00:03:16.370> available<00:03:16.930> so<00:03:17.930> what<00:03:18.410> does<00:03:18.620> this

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:18.829 
components available so what does this

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:22.240 
components available so what does this
mean<00:03:19.069> to<00:03:19.340> you<00:03:19.609> you<00:03:20.060> might<00:03:20.269> ask<00:03:20.590> using<00:03:21.590> highly

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.250 
mean to you you might ask using highly

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:24.280 
mean to you you might ask using highly
sophisticated<00:03:22.480> technology<00:03:23.480> which<00:03:23.930> you

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.290 
sophisticated technology which you

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:26.949 
sophisticated technology which you
couldn't<00:03:24.650> possibly<00:03:25.000> understand<00:03:26.000> we<00:03:26.720> will<00:03:26.840> be

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:26.959 
couldn't possibly understand we will be

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:28.930 
couldn't possibly understand we will be
extracting<00:03:27.410> a<00:03:27.859> large<00:03:28.160> portion<00:03:28.549> of<00:03:28.730> your

extracting a large portion of your

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:31.740 
extracting a large portion of your
planet<00:03:29.359> and<00:03:29.569> adding<00:03:30.109> it<00:03:30.230> to<00:03:30.260> our<00:03:30.590> new<00:03:31.040> one

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750
