 Hello, this is Haha Kizu Toy. 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:24.699
 Today's toys are train squad 

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:29.340
 It will be aired in Korea this summer as a train force in July. 

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:34.369
 The toy is set with main robot TOKYO and Tokyu changer together. 

00:00:34.369 --> 00:00:37.400
 Let's start with Takuo. 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:42.860
 The Tokyu Changer will look at next time. As an item that transforms into Letscha 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:45.280
 Rasha means train. 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:51.550
 There are five rats, so if you connect them all, you will get a 1.2m long train. 

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:55.840
 Also, if you combine everything from Rasha No. 1 to No. 5 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:59.020
 The main robot Tokuyo is completed. 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:01.480
 Unlike the previous work, 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:05.060
 It does not contain sound gimmick and led gimmick. 

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:09.880
 Instead, it is a toy that emphasizes interlocking play with weapon and transformation item. 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.720
 An intuitive combination of transformation is an advantage. 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.500
 It will be released in Korea after localization. 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.840
 I already look forward to what name it will be. 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.170
 Here's the explanation, and I'm going to open it. 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.360
 Be careful when using a knife.
