but<00:01:03.700> then<00:01:03.820> you're<00:01:03.940> going<00:01:04.030> to<00:01:04.120> let<00:01:04.360> off<00:01:04.570> once

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:05.110 
but then you're going to let off once

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:07.440 
but then you're going to let off once
you<00:01:05.260> have<00:01:05.410> let<00:01:05.620> off<00:01:05.800> after<00:01:06.670> you've<00:01:06.880> gotten<00:01:07.240> to

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:09.250 
the desired speed so you're going to

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:11.700 
the desired speed so you're going to
accelerate<00:01:09.580> to<00:01:10.390> say<00:01:10.570> 40<00:01:10.840> miles<00:01:11.020> per<00:01:11.140> hour<00:01:11.290> and

then you're going to let off the gas a
little<00:01:13.180> bit<00:01:13.300> and<00:01:13.570> then<00:01:13.900> just<00:01:13.930> maintain<00:01:14.710> but

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:15.130

is that when on your gauge on your

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.170 
is that when on your gauge on your
tachometer<00:01:30.610> you're<00:01:30.700> gonna<00:01:30.820> have<00:01:30.940> a<00:01:30.970> little

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:31.180 
tachometer you're gonna have a little

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:33.810 
tachometer you're gonna have a little
light<00:01:31.330> that<00:01:31.360> says<00:01:31.690> eco<00:01:32.140> you<00:01:32.950> can<00:01:33.100> see<00:01:33.280> how<00:01:33.430> it's

effective<00:01:47.290> way<00:01:47.440> to<00:01:47.500> get<00:01:47.680> the<00:01:47.740> most<00:01:48.070> gas

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:48.340 
effective way to get the most gas

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.940 
effective way to get the most gas
mileage<00:01:48.789> out<00:01:49.000> of<00:01:49.420> your<00:01:49.750> car<00:01:49.930> so<00:01:50.200> whenever<00:01:50.770> I

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:50.950 
mileage out of your car so whenever I

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:52.440 
mileage out of your car so whenever I
accelerate<00:01:51.580> what<00:01:52.000> you're<00:01:52.149> going<00:01:52.270> to<00:01:52.330> notice

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:52.450 
accelerate what you're going to notice

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:54.270 
accelerate what you're going to notice
is<00:01:52.780> this<00:01:53.110> Eco<00:01:53.440> lights<00:01:53.649> going<00:01:53.830> to<00:01:53.920> click<00:01:54.160> on

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:54.280 
is this Eco lights going to click on

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.480 
is this Eco lights going to click on
okay<00:01:55.060> I'm<00:01:55.960> going<00:01:56.229> at<00:01:56.350> a<00:01:56.440> slow<00:01:56.680> steady<00:01:56.950> pace<00:01:57.070> my

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:57.490 
okay I'm going at a slow steady pace my

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:04.330 
okay I'm going at a slow steady pace my
rpms<00:01:57.910> are<00:01:58.119> stabilized<00:01:58.780> for<00:01:59.470> the<00:01:59.530> most<00:01:59.710> part

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.340 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:09.840 

now<00:02:04.850> this<00:02:05.000> is<00:02:05.119> a<00:02:05.149> slow<00:02:05.479> acceleration<00:02:05.840> no<00:02:06.350> doubt

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:09.850 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:11.670 

you<00:02:10.360> see<00:02:10.570> you<00:02:10.840> just<00:02:10.990> have<00:02:11.110> to<00:02:11.260> kind<00:02:11.440> of<00:02:11.470> play

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
you see you just have to kind of play

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.340 
you see you just have to kind of play
with<00:02:11.710> it<00:02:11.920> to<00:02:12.430> find

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:15.350 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:20.030 

what<00:02:15.980> that<00:02:16.160> acceleration<00:02:16.610> is<00:02:16.820> going<00:02:16.970> to<00:02:17.030> be

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.530 

some<00:02:20.640> 140<00:02:21.000> miles<00:02:21.180> per<00:02:21.360> hour<00:02:23.150> and<00:02:24.150> that<00:02:24.299> eco

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
some 140 miles per hour and that eco

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.449 
some 140 miles per hour and that eco
light<00:02:24.750> is<00:02:25.620> still<00:02:25.890> on

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:32.040 

okay

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.050 
okay

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:34.380 
okay
so<00:02:32.680> now<00:02:32.830> what<00:02:32.950> I'm<00:02:33.010> going<00:02:33.040> to<00:02:33.190> do

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
so now what I'm going to do

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:37.340 
so now what I'm going to do
I'll<00:02:34.780> just<00:02:34.930> say<00:02:35.050> my<00:02:35.080> desire<00:02:35.470> to<00:02:35.500> speed<00:02:36.040> is<00:02:36.190> 50

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
I'll just say my desire to speed is 50

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:39.470 
I'll just say my desire to speed is 50
I'm<00:02:37.800> going<00:02:37.950> to<00:02:38.010> let<00:02:38.130> off<00:02:38.220> the<00:02:38.370> gas<00:02:38.400> just<00:02:38.910> a<00:02:39.060> hair

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
I'm going to let off the gas just a hair

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.750 
I'm going to let off the gas just a hair
and<00:02:40.080> then<00:02:40.170> I'm<00:02:40.290> going<00:02:40.380> to<00:02:40.470> reapply<00:02:40.680> it<00:02:40.920> and

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
and then I'm going to reapply it and

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.660 
and then I'm going to reapply it and
what<00:02:41.880> that's<00:02:42.060> done<00:02:42.270> to<00:02:43.200> my<00:02:43.670> miles-per-gallon

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
what that's done to my miles-per-gallon

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.930 
what that's done to my miles-per-gallon
is<00:02:45.090> it's<00:02:45.570> just<00:02:45.750> done<00:02:45.930> some<00:02:46.320> significant

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
is it's just done some significant

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:49.460 
is it's just done some significant
significant<00:02:47.940> work<00:02:48.150> so<00:02:48.450> you<00:02:48.540> see<00:02:48.690> I'm<00:02:48.780> plus<00:02:49.080> 40

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
significant work so you see I'm plus 40

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.590 
significant work so you see I'm plus 40
right<00:02:49.650> now<00:02:49.830> it<00:02:50.430> was<00:02:50.610> a<00:02:50.640> 60<00:02:51.150> but<00:02:51.270> I<00:02:51.300> don't<00:02:51.510> think

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
right now it was a 60 but I don't think

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.390 
right now it was a 60 but I don't think
that's<00:02:51.810> really<00:02:52.050> realistic<00:02:52.620> I<00:02:52.800> think<00:02:53.160> you<00:02:53.220> can

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
that's really realistic I think you can

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.730 
that's really realistic I think you can
realistically<00:02:54.120> get<00:02:54.630> 40<00:02:54.930> miles<00:02:55.110> per<00:02:55.350> gallon

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:55.740 
realistically get 40 miles per gallon

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:58.280 
realistically get 40 miles per gallon
driving<00:02:56.070> this<00:02:56.160> in<00:02:56.340> the<00:02:56.400> highway<00:02:57.110> once<00:02:58.110> you

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
driving this in the highway once you

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.020 
driving this in the highway once you
have<00:02:58.500> learned<00:02:59.010> how<00:02:59.190> to<00:02:59.220> correctly<00:02:59.640> apply<00:02:59.970> the

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
have learned how to correctly apply the

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:13.449 
have learned how to correctly apply the
gas<00:03:00.300> and<00:03:01.080> accelerate

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:13.459 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:15.229 

all<00:03:14.459> right<00:03:14.640> so<00:03:14.819> now<00:03:14.940> I'm<00:03:15.030> gonna<00:03:15.120> be

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:15.239 
all right so now I'm gonna be

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:24.490 
all right so now I'm gonna be
accelerating<00:03:15.750> to<00:03:15.900> 60

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:24.500 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:27.280 

all<00:03:24.950> right<00:03:25.070> so<00:03:25.340> that's<00:03:25.460> 60<00:03:25.970> known<00:03:26.750> newsmen<00:03:27.110> let

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.290 
all right so that's 60 known newsmen let

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:28.540 
all right so that's 60 known newsmen let
up<00:03:27.380> the<00:03:27.470> gas<00:03:27.620> you<00:03:27.830> can<00:03:27.950> see<00:03:28.070> the<00:03:28.160> eagle<00:03:28.400> light

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:28.550 
up the gas you can see the eagle light

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:33.300 
up the gas you can see the eagle light
just<00:03:28.820> came<00:03:28.970> on<00:03:29.030> and<00:03:29.440> now<00:03:30.730> maintaining<00:03:31.730> at<00:03:31.910> 60

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
just came on and now maintaining at 60

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:36.180 
just came on and now maintaining at 60
my<00:03:34.310> fuel<00:03:34.550> mileage

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:36.190 
my fuel mileage

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:37.900 
my fuel mileage
a little<00:03:36.490> bit<00:03:36.580> about<00:03:36.760> 40

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:37.910 
a little bit about 40

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:40.140 
a little bit about 40
I<00:03:38.000> can<00:03:38.330> let<00:03:38.450> off<00:03:38.570> the<00:03:38.660> gas<00:03:38.690> just<00:03:39.020> a<00:03:39.170> hair<00:03:39.380> more

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:40.150 
I can let off the gas just a hair more

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:43.030 
I can let off the gas just a hair more
it's<00:03:41.150> really<00:03:41.540> tricky<00:03:41.810> but<00:03:42.470> you<00:03:42.710> have<00:03:42.890> the

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.040 
it's really tricky but you have the

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.660 
it's really tricky but you have the
ability<00:03:44.500> to<00:03:45.500> get<00:03:45.650> some<00:03:45.830> sick-ass<00:03:46.370> amount

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:46.670 
ability to get some sick-ass amount

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:47.590 
ability to get some sick-ass amount
which<00:03:46.790> I'm<00:03:46.880> just<00:03:46.910> going<00:03:47.120> to<00:03:47.150> hold<00:03:47.270> this<00:03:47.420> here

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:47.600 
which I'm just going to hold this here

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:49.840 
which I'm just going to hold this here
and<00:03:47.780> prove<00:03:48.050> to<00:03:48.260> you<00:03:48.380> of<00:03:49.070> what<00:03:49.250> I'm<00:03:49.400> doing

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:49.850 
and prove to you of what I'm doing

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:52.750 
and prove to you of what I'm doing
see<00:03:50.510> that<00:03:50.690> so<00:03:51.350> don't<00:03:51.560> like<00:03:51.680> 57<00:03:52.130> miles<00:03:52.400> per<00:03:52.580> hour

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:52.760 
see that so don't like 57 miles per hour

00:03:52.760 --> 00:04:12.059 
see that so don't like 57 miles per hour
been<00:03:53.150> doing<00:03:53.300> that<00:03:53.390> for<00:03:53.570> just<00:03:53.630> a<00:03:53.750> little<00:03:53.960> while

00:04:12.059 --> 00:04:12.069 

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:13.949 

and<00:04:12.610> that's<00:04:12.760> how<00:04:12.819> you<00:04:12.879> do<00:04:13.030> it<00:04:13.060> pretty<00:04:13.510> easy<00:04:13.750> huh

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:13.959 
and that's how you do it pretty easy huh

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:17.129 
and that's how you do it pretty easy huh
see<00:04:14.769> you<00:04:14.829> next<00:04:15.040> time
