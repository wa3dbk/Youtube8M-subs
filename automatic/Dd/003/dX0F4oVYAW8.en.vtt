00:00:05.899 --> 00:00:11.759
 I welcome you all again, dear friends 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:14.820
 with you again the cream is ready and this 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.540
 The second part of the review is am x 50 100 against 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.520
 from 6 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.279
 and in the second part of the review as it is not difficult 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.480
 guess we will be overlooked amx 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.670
 50100 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.500
 more accurately review you can find with me 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.689
 on channel a in this part we will 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.689
 compare it and decide what of them 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:34.410
 better and worse or they are quite self 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:37.260
 keeps parity so let's get about fifty 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.000
 one hundred fifty one is also machine 8 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.340
 level as of 6 as I said 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.430
 turns on the global map 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.800
 what do we have here we have here 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.950
 quite an interesting weapon with 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.750
 drum loading please note 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:55.110
 recharged this wonderful tool 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:58.140
 almost 25 seconds while mixing 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:00.510
 is two with a little that's great 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.660
 it is generally wonderful two point three 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:06.000
 tenths of a second are adequate numbers and 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.100
 they allow us to be reduced in time 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.470
 even between was almost time to come down 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.030
 between shots in the drum reload 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.920
 between shots in the drum itself 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:17.700
 is one point nine 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:19.950
 seconds we have 6 bullets for 400 damage with 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:23.520
 breaking through 232 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:26.460
 with dozens at amx 50100 feels like 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.259
 much more confident than out of 6 due to the fact 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.930
 what to punch him and that's enough for 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:35.220
 to punch them wes 6 remind on 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:37.979
 Goldie 217 breakthrough Babes 232 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:40.829
 so here in one drum contains 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:44.009
 as I said 6 bullets for 400 damage and 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:46.950
 This means that we can apply 2,400 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:49.110
 in just ten seconds it is of course 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.720
 not to say that it was very painful 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.850
 but take the seven we can really with 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.909
 sevens we meet only in the top a 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:59.579
 with dozens we can half carry 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:01.740
 any this dozens of this 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:05.850
 dangerous for a dozen but we are no less 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:09.080
 vulnerable us hp less than i-6 armor 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:11.300
 and how the heap makes its way 50100 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:14.880
 incredibly huge body 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:17.819
 barn shaped shapes and shapes just in 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:20.310
 any place and therefore should be remembered 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:22.800
 that it cannot be substituted on it at all 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:25.530
 at the same time we do not have any excess of the 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.690
 highly dynamic tank accelerates very 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:30.900
 slow if you suddenly want to 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:33.930
 gain speed then write everything is gone yes 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:37.200
 the tank itself is pretty smart when 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:39.510
 accelerate but this very same this set 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:42.209
 speeds usually drag on pretty 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:44.340
 long term is wonderful 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:46.380
 also want to drive back sharply 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.550
 you will not leave and you will fly duyko 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:50.130
 should be reminded 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:52.830
 and actually have this knowledge and 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.569
 he skillfully applied it in battle so that 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:56.430
 you 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:58.830
 shot out and the enemy for you did not have time 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:00.750
 would love to remind you that in 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:04.410
 tenth level battles are such 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:07.830
 cars are dangerous as its 77 or let's say 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:10.950
 fv 4005 god forbid fv 4005 can you 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:13.610
 just sanshoit 277 will leave unpleasant 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:17.310
 feeling that you will stay there on 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:19.380
 350 efficiency and any spittle in your direction 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:22.620
 will take you Wang 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:23.820
 therefore, amx 50100 is not substituted 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:26.400
 recommended until 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:29.310
 from 6 something else even with dozens of discourage 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.900
 can this car even with 8 feels 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:33.209
 yourself very sad when on her 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.670
 shoot but gun here of course 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:36.510
 out of competition, it is much better than 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:38.549
 IS-6 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:40.769
 and therefore for myself I have defined 

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:43.140
 winners are so am x 50 100 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:45.930
 getting into battle with ninth tenth level 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:48.450
 undoubtedly in the black but out of 6 beats him 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:51.090
 due to good armor in battles with 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:53.670
 eights so swing both cars i 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:56.010
 would probably recommend 50100 and woman 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:58.140
 cars fall with dozens a.yu. 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:00.600
 does the 50100 feel like them 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:03.840
 so much more confident therefore buy it 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:05.010
 first i think this is the right choice well 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:07.170
 Well with you there was a hook tv 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:09.209
 I hope my video was useful for you 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:11.310
 and you decide for yourself something not 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:13.019
 forget to subscribe to the channel and not 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:16.970
 forget to proceed in the group VKontakte 

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:16.970
 don't be late for the contest yet
