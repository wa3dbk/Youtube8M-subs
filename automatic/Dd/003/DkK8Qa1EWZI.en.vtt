to f3 attacking the bishop black to move

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:42.729 
to f3 attacking the bishop black to move
what<00:03:37.290> is<00:03:37.470> the<00:03:37.650> best<00:03:37.829> way<00:03:37.980> for<00:03:38.310> the<00:03:38.400> bishop<00:03:38.730> I

00:03:42.729 --> 00:03:42.739 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:45.740 

guess<00:03:43.739> I<00:03:43.859> would<00:03:44.010> play<00:03:44.189> Bishop<00:03:44.519> to<00:03:44.639> d6<00:03:45.000> this

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
guess I would play Bishop to d6 this

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:50.770 
guess I would play Bishop to d6 this
looks<00:03:45.989> safe<00:03:47.120> do<00:03:48.120> you<00:03:48.180> agree

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:50.780 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:56.770 

Helmke<00:03:52.219> surprised<00:03:53.219> his<00:03:53.519> opponent<00:03:53.969> again

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:56.780 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:02.649 

Bishop<00:03:57.780> to<00:03:58.019> g3<00:03:58.200> was<00:03:58.590> played<00:03:59.329> Knight<00:04:00.329> to<00:04:00.659> h3

00:04:02.649 --> 00:04:02.659 
Bishop to g3 was played Knight to h3

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:07.429 
Bishop to g3 was played Knight to h3
what<00:04:03.659> happens<00:04:03.959> if<00:04:04.609> pawn<00:04:05.609> takes<00:04:05.879> Bishop<00:04:06.439> then

00:04:07.429 --> 00:04:07.439 
what happens if pawn takes Bishop then

00:04:07.439 --> 00:04:09.800 
what happens if pawn takes Bishop then
the<00:04:07.620> knight<00:04:07.859> takes<00:04:08.159> only<00:04:08.549> three<00:04:08.909> working<00:04:09.569> two

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810 
the knight takes only three working two

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:14.719 
the knight takes only three working two
pieces<00:04:10.459> two<00:04:11.459> heavy<00:04:11.879> pieces<00:04:13.459> so<00:04:14.459> we<00:04:14.579> have

00:04:14.719 --> 00:04:14.729 
pieces two heavy pieces so we have

00:04:14.729 --> 00:04:22.930 
pieces two heavy pieces so we have
Knight<00:04:15.180> to<00:04:15.389> h3<00:04:17.299> black<00:04:18.299> to<00:04:18.720> move

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:22.940 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:25.510 

I<00:04:23.000> guess<00:04:23.690> Knight<00:04:24.470> takes<00:04:24.740> bishop<00:04:25.100> comes<00:04:25.280> to

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:25.520 
I guess Knight takes bishop comes to

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:30.430 
I guess Knight takes bishop comes to
mind<00:04:25.700> you<00:04:25.880> agree<00:04:28.540> well<00:04:29.540> I<00:04:29.570> think<00:04:29.750> I<00:04:30.050> would<00:04:30.110> drop

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:30.440

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:36.540 
mind you agree well I think I would drop
