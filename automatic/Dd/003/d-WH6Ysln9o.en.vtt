trying to do as well and it's it's just
I<00:05:55.479> have<00:05:55.779> so<00:05:56.439> much<00:05:56.619> of<00:05:56.679> a<00:05:56.860> different<00:05:57.309> outlook<00:05:58.299> on

00:05:58.409 --> 00:05:58.419 
I have so much of a different outlook on

00:05:58.419 --> 00:06:00.449 
I have so much of a different outlook on
the<00:05:58.539> game<00:05:58.809> now<00:05:59.139> than<00:05:59.469> I<00:05:59.559> did<00:05:59.589> when<00:06:00.009> I<00:06:00.069> was<00:06:00.159> here

00:06:00.449 --> 00:06:00.459 
the game now than I did when I was here

00:06:00.459 --> 00:06:02.399 
the game now than I did when I was here
and<00:06:00.579> you<00:06:00.849> know<00:06:01.389> I<00:06:01.479> think<00:06:01.599> that's<00:06:01.929> part<00:06:02.199> of<00:06:02.349> it

00:06:02.399 --> 00:06:02.409 
and you know I think that's part of it

00:06:02.409 --> 00:06:04.559 
and you know I think that's part of it
you<00:06:02.649> know<00:06:02.679> you<00:06:02.829> grow<00:06:03.099> and<00:06:03.279> you<00:06:03.339> learn<00:06:03.639> and<00:06:03.939> it

00:06:04.559 --> 00:06:04.569 
you know you grow and you learn and it

00:06:04.569 --> 00:06:06.329 
you know you grow and you learn and it
makes<00:06:04.779> you<00:06:04.869> even<00:06:05.019> better<00:06:05.409> like<00:06:05.919> the<00:06:06.039> more<00:06:06.219> you

00:06:06.329 --> 00:06:06.339 
makes you even better like the more you

00:06:06.339 --> 00:06:08.579 
makes you even better like the more you
learn<00:06:06.369> and<00:06:06.759> get<00:06:06.909> better<00:06:06.969> if<00:06:07.719> you're<00:06:08.110> just

00:06:08.579 --> 00:06:08.589 
learn and get better if you're just

00:06:08.589 --> 00:06:12.119 
learn and get better if you're just
going<00:06:08.889> to<00:06:09.009> my<00:06:09.159> fifth<00:06:09.429> year<00:06:09.519> I<00:06:09.879> feel<00:06:10.689> like<00:06:11.129> you

00:06:13.829 --> 00:06:13.839
