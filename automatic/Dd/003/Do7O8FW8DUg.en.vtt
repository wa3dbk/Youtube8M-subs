00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130 
and I have to say I did notice a lot of

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:44.670

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
the brassiness like the yellow tinge to

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.400 
the brassiness like the yellow tinge to
it<00:02:44.890> did<00:02:45.880> come<00:02:46.180> out<00:02:46.210> of<00:02:46.330> my<00:02:46.480> hair<00:02:46.720> so<00:02:46.990> I<00:02:47.020> was

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410 
it did come out of my hair so I was

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:48.750 
it did come out of my hair so I was
really<00:02:47.590> impressed<00:02:47.950> with<00:02:48.010> that<00:02:48.100> and<00:02:48.370> I<00:02:48.550> mean

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
really impressed with that and I mean

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.090 
really impressed with that and I mean
you're<00:02:49.150> so<00:02:49.270> easy<00:02:49.480> I<00:02:49.750> only<00:02:50.080> used<00:02:50.320> about<00:02:50.530> half<00:02:50.710> of

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.100 
you're so easy I only used about half of

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:52.620 
you're so easy I only used about half of
this<00:02:51.220> I<00:02:51.460> just<00:02:51.490> shook<00:02:51.880> it<00:02:51.970> up<00:02:52.090> so<00:02:52.240> it's<00:02:52.390> like<00:02:52.510> all

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
this I just shook it up so it's like all

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:54.330 
this I just shook it up so it's like all
this<00:02:52.870> I<00:02:53.020> but<00:02:53.290> there's<00:02:53.800> probably<00:02:53.890> put<00:02:54.160> that

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
this I but there's probably put that

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.890 
this I but there's probably put that
much<00:02:54.520> left<00:02:54.850> like<00:02:55.590> that's<00:02:56.590> pretty<00:02:56.800> good<00:02:57.480> and<00:02:58.480> if

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
much left like that's pretty good and if

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.230 
much left like that's pretty good and if
you<00:02:59.140> have<00:02:59.350> a<00:02:59.380> salad<00:02:59.770> video<00:03:00.250> card<00:03:00.880> thing<00:03:01.120> you

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:01.240 
you have a salad video card thing you

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:04.050 
you have a salad video card thing you
can<00:03:01.390> get<00:03:01.510> it<00:03:01.630> for<00:03:01.780> $11<00:03:02.500> me<00:03:02.620> nine<00:03:02.860> cents<00:03:03.190> and<00:03:03.610> if

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
can get it for $11 me nine cents and if

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:07.680 
can get it for $11 me nine cents and if
you<00:03:04.390> have<00:03:04.630> if<00:03:05.230> you<00:03:05.380> don't<00:03:05.560> have<00:03:05.710> it<00:03:06.150> $12.49<00:03:07.150> so

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:07.690 
you have if you don't have it $12.49 so

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:11.460 
you have if you don't have it $12.49 so
very<00:03:07.930> reasonable<00:03:08.590> pricing<00:03:09.070> and<00:03:09.310> stuff<00:03:09.580> so<00:03:10.470> um

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.470 
very reasonable pricing and stuff so um

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:13.860 
very reasonable pricing and stuff so um
I<00:03:12.430> think<00:03:12.850> I<00:03:13.090> would<00:03:13.300> try<00:03:13.510> this<00:03:13.570> again

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:13.870 
I think I would try this again

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:16.440 
I think I would try this again
definitely<00:03:14.110> if<00:03:14.640> it's<00:03:15.640> affordable<00:03:16.180> it<00:03:16.330> is

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:16.450 
definitely if it's affordable it is

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:19.110 
definitely if it's affordable it is
affordable<00:03:16.720> I<00:03:16.989> mean<00:03:17.280> the<00:03:18.280> amount<00:03:18.459> you<00:03:18.700> get<00:03:18.910> you

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 
affordable I mean the amount you get you

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.870 
affordable I mean the amount you get you
get<00:03:19.270> to<00:03:19.540> get<00:03:20.050> you<00:03:20.260> like<00:03:20.860> 2<00:03:21.220> uses<00:03:21.610> out<00:03:21.700> of<00:03:21.760> it

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:21.880 
get to get you like 2 uses out of it

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:23.400 
get to get you like 2 uses out of it
probably<00:03:22.330> and<00:03:22.420> if<00:03:22.540> you<00:03:22.630> even<00:03:22.750> have<00:03:22.989> less<00:03:23.170> hair

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:23.410 
probably and if you even have less hair

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:24.600 
probably and if you even have less hair
than<00:03:23.440> I<00:03:23.620> do<00:03:23.680> which<00:03:24.010> I<00:03:24.100> don't<00:03:24.160> have<00:03:24.280> very<00:03:24.400> much

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:24.610 
than I do which I don't have very much

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:26.040 
than I do which I don't have very much
hair<00:03:24.670> then<00:03:25.120> you<00:03:25.150> probably<00:03:25.570> get<00:03:25.720> a<00:03:25.750> little<00:03:25.959> more

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:26.050 
hair then you probably get a little more

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:27.270 
hair then you probably get a little more
there's<00:03:26.260> a<00:03:26.290> little<00:03:26.470> more<00:03:26.590> than<00:03:26.739> half<00:03:26.890> in<00:03:27.100> there

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
there's a little more than half in there

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:31.770 
there's a little more than half in there
so<00:03:29.340> it<00:03:30.340> doesn't<00:03:30.400> really<00:03:30.760> have<00:03:30.940> that<00:03:31.120> bad<00:03:31.330> smell

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:31.780 
so it doesn't really have that bad smell

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:33.300 
so it doesn't really have that bad smell
it's<00:03:32.020> not<00:03:32.200> really<00:03:32.440> like<00:03:32.590> strong<00:03:32.800> here<00:03:33.160> -<00:03:33.250> I

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
it's not really like strong here - I

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:35.670 
it's not really like strong here - I
smell<00:03:33.370> so<00:03:33.940> and<00:03:34.780> you<00:03:34.900> can<00:03:35.050> also<00:03:35.200> get<00:03:35.440> this<00:03:35.620> in

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680 
smell so and you can also get this in

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.000 
smell so and you can also get this in
