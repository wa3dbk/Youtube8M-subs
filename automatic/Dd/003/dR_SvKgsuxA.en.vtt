that<00:01:30.380> they're<00:01:30.619> from<00:01:31.210> millions<00:01:32.210> of<00:01:32.390> years<00:01:32.630> ago

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
yes we were at a research site where

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.140 
yes we were at a research site where
paleontologists<00:02:37.489> have<00:02:37.580> found<00:02:37.790> a<00:02:37.910> lot<00:02:38.120> of

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
paleontologists have found a lot of

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.330 
paleontologists have found a lot of
fossils<00:02:38.690> over<00:02:38.870> the<00:02:38.989> years<00:02:39.230> we<00:02:39.890> saw<00:02:40.069> several

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
fossils over the years we saw several

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:55.880 
fossils over the years we saw several
places<00:02:40.760> where<00:02:41.000> they<00:02:41.239> have<00:02:41.360> dug<00:02:41.540> up<00:02:41.690> Dino<00:02:41.930> bones

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:00.440 

I<00:02:57.200> wonder<00:02:58.200> what<00:02:58.320> this<00:02:58.440> is<00:02:58.830> well<00:02:59.460> Molly<00:03:00.000> told<00:03:00.270> us

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
I wonder what this is well Molly told us

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:01.730 
I wonder what this is well Molly told us
they<00:03:00.540> were<00:03:00.660> digging<00:03:00.840> up<00:03:01.050> some<00:03:01.200> nests<00:03:01.500> around

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:01.740 
they were digging up some nests around

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:03.560 
they were digging up some nests around
here<00:03:01.950> look<00:03:02.310> at<00:03:02.430> all<00:03:02.520> these<00:03:02.610> black<00:03:02.850> pieces<00:03:03.090> whoa

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:03.570

finally<00:03:04.470> you<00:03:04.650> saw<00:03:04.830> what<00:03:05.040> egg<00:03:05.160> Mountain<00:03:05.460> is

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550 
finally you saw what egg Mountain is

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:08.270 
finally you saw what egg Mountain is
famous<00:03:06.030> for<00:03:06.240> traces<00:03:07.110> of<00:03:07.140> a<00:03:07.290> dinosaur<00:03:07.740> nest<00:03:07.980> and

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:32.820 
they are still removing from the rock I

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:34.310 
they are still removing from the rock I
really<00:03:33.300> want<00:03:33.480> to<00:03:33.600> measure<00:03:33.720> the<00:03:33.989> length<00:03:34.020> of

cast of Maiasaura and other dinosaur
bones<00:04:51.320> wow<00:04:52.280> this<00:04:52.670> is<00:04:52.880> much<00:04:53.240> smaller<00:04:53.480> than<00:04:53.840> the

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:53.990 
bones wow this is much smaller than the

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:56.860 
bones wow this is much smaller than the
one<00:04:54.140> we<00:04:54.170> found<00:04:54.470> an<00:04:54.650> egg<00:04:54.800> Mountain<00:04:55.280> right<00:04:55.910> but

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:56.870 
one we found an egg Mountain right but

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:00.190 
one we found an egg Mountain right but
as<00:04:57.110> stumbo<00:04:58.010> get<00:04:58.250> if<00:04:58.460> this<00:04:58.670> is<00:04:58.820> old<00:04:59.150> or<00:04:59.570> young<00:04:59.930> I

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:00.200 
as stumbo get if this is old or young I

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:01.870 
as stumbo get if this is old or young I
think<00:05:00.380> we<00:05:00.740> need<00:05:00.920> to<00:05:01.040> compare<00:05:01.340> these<00:05:01.490> to<00:05:01.670> some

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:01.880 
think we need to compare these to some

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:04.120 
think we need to compare these to some
other<00:05:02.090> bones<00:05:02.330> bones<00:05:03.170> were<00:05:03.380> a<00:05:03.440> scientists<00:05:03.950> know

other bones bones were a scientists know

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:06.250 
other bones bones were a scientists know
whether<00:05:04.400> the<00:05:04.610> Dinos<00:05:05.000> were<00:05:05.030> babies<00:05:05.570> or<00:05:05.720> adults

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:06.260 
whether the Dinos were babies or adults

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:07.960 
whether the Dinos were babies or adults
I<00:05:06.440> know<00:05:06.830> they<00:05:07.160> have<00:05:07.340> some<00:05:07.520> of<00:05:07.610> those<00:05:07.700> bones

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:07.970 
I know they have some of those bones

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:12.750 
I know they have some of those bones

the adult bone it went all the way up to
103<00:06:17.570> centimeters<00:06:18.230> long<00:06:18.530> wow<00:06:19.100> that's<00:06:19.460> a<00:06:19.580> big

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:19.820 
103 centimeters long wow that's a big

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:23.890 
103 centimeters long wow that's a big
joke<00:06:21.850> so<00:06:22.850> the<00:06:22.940> bone<00:06:23.120> we<00:06:23.270> found<00:06:23.480> on<00:06:23.600> the<00:06:23.690> cart

00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:23.900 
joke so the bone we found on the cart

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:26.650 
joke so the bone we found on the cart
was<00:06:24.080> 19<00:06:24.530> centimeters<00:06:24.830> long<00:06:25.250> that's<00:06:26.150> closest

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:26.660 
was 19 centimeters long that's closest

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:28.390 
was 19 centimeters long that's closest
to<00:06:26.690> the<00:06:26.870> small<00:06:27.140> nestling<00:06:27.620> which<00:06:27.860> was<00:06:28.040> 11

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:28.400 
to the small nestling which was 11

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:30.670 
to the small nestling which was 11
centimeters<00:06:28.880> the<00:06:29.630> bone<00:06:29.810> we<00:06:30.140> found<00:06:30.380> in<00:06:30.590> the

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:30.680 
centimeters the bone we found in the

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:33.820 
centimeters the bone we found in the
field<00:06:30.950> is<00:06:31.390> 92<00:06:32.390> centimeters<00:06:32.630> long<00:06:33.110> and<00:06:33.380> it<00:06:33.650> fits

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:33.830 
field is 92 centimeters long and it fits

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:36.340 
field is 92 centimeters long and it fits
between<00:06:33.980> the<00:06:34.220> sub-adult<00:06:34.790> a<00:06:34.940> needle<00:06:35.450> yeah<00:06:36.050> but

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:36.350 
between the sub-adult a needle yeah but

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:38.020 
between the sub-adult a needle yeah but
it's<00:06:36.470> closer<00:06:36.680> to<00:06:36.890> an<00:06:36.950> adult<00:06:37.250> so<00:06:37.670> I<00:06:37.700> think<00:06:37.790> the

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:38.030 
it's closer to an adult so I think the

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:39.490 
it's closer to an adult so I think the
dennis<00:06:38.300> an<00:06:38.420> egg<00:06:38.570> mountain<00:06:38.900> was<00:06:39.050> an<00:06:39.170> adult<00:06:39.440> when

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:39.500 
dennis an egg mountain was an adult when

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:42.010 
dennis an egg mountain was an adult when
she<00:06:39.710> died<00:06:39.860> but<00:06:40.370> how<00:06:40.550> old<00:06:40.580> is<00:06:40.880> an<00:06:41.030> adult<00:06:41.330> is<00:06:41.840> it

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:42.020 
she died but how old is an adult is it

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:45.160 
she died but how old is an adult is it
25<00:06:42.470> 30<00:06:43.250> and<00:06:44.000> how<00:06:44.150> long<00:06:44.330> did<00:06:44.540> dinosaurs<00:06:44.690> live

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:45.170 
25 30 and how long did dinosaurs live

anyways<00:06:45.590> I<00:06:45.890> know<00:06:46.340> let's<00:06:46.850> go<00:06:46.940> inside<00:06:47.270> and<00:06:47.420> see

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:47.510 
anyways I know let's go inside and see

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:50.360 
anyways I know let's go inside and see
if<00:06:47.660> we<00:06:47.720> can<00:06:47.840> find<00:06:47.990> some<00:06:48.200> clues

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:50.370 
if we can find some clues

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:52.909
