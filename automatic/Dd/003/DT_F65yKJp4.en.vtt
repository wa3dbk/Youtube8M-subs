but<00:02:51.360> or<00:02:52.319> fight<00:02:52.560> ended<00:02:52.860> flat<00:02:53.069> back<00:02:53.400> and<00:02:53.730> wait<00:02:54.180> a

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
but or fight ended flat back and wait a

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:56.839 
but or fight ended flat back and wait a
bit<00:02:54.390> there<00:02:54.569> but<00:02:54.750> yeah<00:02:55.500> it's<00:02:56.250> different<00:02:56.640> I'll

00:02:56.839 --> 00:02:56.849
