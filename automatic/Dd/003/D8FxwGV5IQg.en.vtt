00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:05.850
 hello look at that national van 

00:00:04.069 --> 00:00:07.620
 weerplaza.nl 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.179
 we see weird images on the movements 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.050
 precipitation from the southwest Netherlands 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:11.490
 moving in 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.530
 see the precipitation also in quantity 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.599
 increase and also to have quite a bit to 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.619
 moves very slowly from southwest to 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.240
 northeast 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.039
 a quarter past a bearing, so two precipitation 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.180
 tapes with most rain when on top 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.230
 Belgium 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.330
 but it continues tonight 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.310
 eastwards and only then and tonight 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.289
 it then largely dry again 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.060
 to do with the malfunction malfunction 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.480
 they fought at 10 o'clock west of 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.760
 low-pressure area dismissal near 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:39.000
 england and and a cold front and then what 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.379
 so slowly came our way 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.550
 and we will see that more often the coming 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.040
 days because it will all be something 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.780
 more volatile the beautiful summer what 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.700
 have had a large part of you 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.230
 just a single dip it seems 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.950
 August not really nice by 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.940
 put 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.680
 coming days are mainly 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.270
 low pressure areas near the 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.250
 british islands that weather with us 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.960
 dominate 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:59.399
 tonight temperatures around 19 degrees 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.800
 midnight 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.090
 and, as said, the heavy rain draws 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.040
 very slowly to the east until 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.710
 northeast and zealand is tonight 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.450
 it will be a mostly dry tonight 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.460
 then some more places can also dry 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.820
 some mist created temperature drops to 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:17.009
 14 degrees dry weather tomorrow morning 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.020
 but sunny periods 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.850
 line with showers that startles the loop 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.610
 from the day from northwest to southeast 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.810
 across the country between convergence line 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.580
 she will call it 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.930
 for the line the wind blows from it 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.420
 south to southwest 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.950
 and after passing that convergence line 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.840
 the wind turns west to northwest 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.460
 then it will be fine in the coastal provinces 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.650
 weather with good sunny periods 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.930
 it also dry and that narrow line with 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.970
 hefty cumulus clouds and showers where it 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.189
 Peter also says this afternoon tomorrow afternoon 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.899
 can thunder then pulls slowly towards it 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:48.000
 east to southeast 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:50.130
 no rainy day so tomorrow too 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.290
 sunny periods everywhere and temperatures 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.479
 22 to 25 degrees 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.100
 but it can be a single strong shower 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.259
 fall 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.060
 Friday have slightly changeable weather 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.560
 it is dry with much of the day 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.110
 sunny periods with a weak 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.310
 eastern breezes then become 25 to 27 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.630
 degrees 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.399
 but during the afternoon and evening 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.550
 can still rain here and there 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.020
 especially the west 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:13.550
 Friday evening and into the night 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:15.350
 they also move to the east on Saturday 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:16.550
 and Saturday during the day is everywhere 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:18.380
 changeable weather 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:20.450
 From time to time showers every now and then 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:22.910
 sun especially in the afternoon 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:25.160
 temperatures are still somewhat summery 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:27.830
 21 to 25 degrees 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:29.360
 Sunday temperatures around 22 degrees 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:31.250
 new low back area close to it 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.080
 country and therefore again from time to time 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:34.130
 showers but also occasional sun 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:36.140
 and that trend we also see one 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:37.760
 continue next week because then too 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:39.560
 we have to deal with light 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.790
 changeable weather goes the 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:43.190
 temperature down 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:45.530
 we see the temperature at the red 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:47.360
 line is the maximum temperature around 20 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:51.010
 degrees and the night were 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.010
 are between 10 and 15 degrees 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:55.430
 changeable weather so the coming days 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:56.870
 we will have to deal with it 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:58.700
 already have a very nice July month 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:00.950
 had and maybe recovering well 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:05.410
 in the course of next week i am 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:05.410
