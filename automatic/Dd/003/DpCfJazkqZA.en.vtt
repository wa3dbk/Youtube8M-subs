00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:02.900 
just wasn't on par with that and that's
partly<00:03:01.380> I<00:03:01.470> believe<00:03:01.739> the<00:03:01.830> reason<00:03:01.980> why<00:03:02.610> they<00:03:02.790> had

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709 
to go with Chris and he said that it was

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:06.620 
to go with Chris and he said that it was
a<00:03:04.739> tough<00:03:04.980> decision<00:03:05.010> but<00:03:05.910> nonetheless<00:03:05.970> he<00:03:06.480> will

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
a tough decision but nonetheless he will

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:08.780 
a tough decision but nonetheless he will
be<00:03:06.959> perfectly<00:03:07.470> for<00:03:07.830> the<00:03:07.890> role<00:03:08.010> of<00:03:08.040> freedom<00:03:08.519> and
