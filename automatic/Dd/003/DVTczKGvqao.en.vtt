00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:53.790 
with the last treatment we're gonna go a
little<00:01:52.570> bit<00:01:52.720> higher<00:01:52.930> today<00:01:53.230> if<00:01:53.500> at<00:01:53.620> any<00:01:53.740> time

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:53.800 
little bit higher today if at any time

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:55.050 
little bit higher today if at any time
you<00:01:54.160> feel<00:01:54.190> like<00:01:54.340> you<00:01:54.490> need<00:01:54.610> to<00:01:54.700> take<00:01:54.820> a<00:01:54.850> break

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
you feel like you need to take a break

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.000 
you feel like you need to take a break
if<00:01:55.270> it<00:01:55.360> feels<00:01:55.540> too<00:01:55.810> warm<00:01:56.080> let<00:01:56.530> me<00:01:56.560> know<00:01:56.800> but

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:57.010 
if it feels too warm let me know but

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:59.580 
if it feels too warm let me know but
remember<00:01:57.130> that<00:01:57.460> the<00:01:58.330> actual<00:01:58.900> crystal<00:01:59.440> that

00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.590 
remember that the actual crystal that

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:01.410 
remember that the actual crystal that
I'm<00:01:59.680> putting<00:01:59.950> on<00:02:00.100> your<00:02:00.250> chest<00:02:00.580> that<00:02:00.730> the<00:02:00.880> light

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 
I'm putting on your chest that the light

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.840 
I'm putting on your chest that the light
comes<00:02:01.720> through<00:02:02.170> it<00:02:02.800> has<00:02:02.980> a<00:02:03.010> coolant<00:02:03.460> so<00:02:03.700> this

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:03.850 
comes through it has a coolant so this

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:06.180 
comes through it has a coolant so this
as<00:02:04.090> you<00:02:04.480> know<00:02:04.600> it's<00:02:04.840> well<00:02:05.050> tolerated<00:02:05.260> great

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:06.190 
as you know it's well tolerated great

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:12.510 
as you know it's well tolerated great
okay

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:14.610 

anytime<00:02:13.360> you<00:02:13.450> do<00:02:13.570> a<00:02:13.600> light<00:02:13.870> treatment<00:02:14.410> whether

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
anytime you do a light treatment whether

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.350 
anytime you do a light treatment whether
it<00:02:14.710> be<00:02:14.800> to<00:02:14.920> the<00:02:15.040> face<00:02:15.220> or<00:02:15.460> the<00:02:15.520> chest<00:02:15.820> because

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
it be to the face or the chest because

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:17.970 
it be to the face or the chest because
you're<00:02:16.600> heating<00:02:16.840> the<00:02:17.020> dermis<00:02:17.410> when<00:02:17.710> you<00:02:17.770> heat

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
you're heating the dermis when you heat

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:19.950 
you're heating the dermis when you heat
the<00:02:18.100> dermis<00:02:18.490> it<00:02:18.760> stimulates<00:02:19.450> the<00:02:19.570> fiberglass

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:19.960 
the dermis it stimulates the fiberglass

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:23.190 
the dermis it stimulates the fiberglass
to<00:02:20.380> reduce<00:02:20.620> collagen<00:02:21.250> so<00:02:21.820> why<00:02:22.300> not<00:02:22.540> treat<00:02:23.050> the

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
to reduce collagen so why not treat the

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:28.980 
to reduce collagen so why not treat the
entire<00:02:23.590> areas<00:02:24.220> but<00:02:24.520> rejuvenate<00:02:25.000> the<00:02:25.120> skin<00:02:27.990> how

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:28.990 
entire areas but rejuvenate the skin how

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:31.410 
entire areas but rejuvenate the skin how
are<00:02:29.050> you<00:02:29.140> doing<00:02:29.350> Debbie<00:02:29.560> great<00:02:30.340> we<00:02:31.030> treated

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
are you doing Debbie great we treated

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.690 
are you doing Debbie great we treated
you<00:02:31.510> with<00:02:31.600> a<00:02:31.660> light<00:02:32.020> treatment<00:02:32.740> not<00:02:33.250> a<00:02:33.280> laser

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
you with a light treatment not a laser

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.330 
you with a light treatment not a laser
treatment<00:02:34.330> that's<00:02:34.540> going<00:02:34.780> to<00:02:34.990> come<00:02:35.380> next<00:02:35.590> with

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
treatment that's going to come next with

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.130 
treatment that's going to come next with
a<00:02:36.370> light<00:02:36.700> treatment<00:02:37.210> with<00:02:37.300> a<00:02:37.330> wavelength<00:02:37.900> of

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
a light treatment with a wavelength of

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.680 
a light treatment with a wavelength of
515<00:02:38.860> which<00:02:39.070> is<00:02:39.190> perfect<00:02:39.850> for<00:02:40.060> the<00:02:40.120> dark<00:02:40.360> spots

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
515 which is perfect for the dark spots

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:44.010 
515 which is perfect for the dark spots
okay<00:02:41.350> so<00:02:41.500> this<00:02:41.830> specific<00:02:42.520> wavelength<00:02:43.090> targets

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:44.020 
okay so this specific wavelength targets

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:45.750 
okay so this specific wavelength targets
the<00:02:44.230> brown<00:02:44.610> pigment

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
the brown pigment

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.120 
the brown pigment
okay<00:02:46.300> so<00:02:46.360> what<00:02:46.750> it<00:02:46.870> does<00:02:47.020> is<00:02:47.650> that<00:02:47.710> brown

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.130 
okay so what it does is that brown

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:50.310 
okay so what it does is that brown
pigment<00:02:48.580> attracts<00:02:49.030> that<00:02:49.270> light<00:02:49.570> it<00:02:49.810> heats<00:02:50.140> up

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:50.320 
pigment attracts that light it heats up

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:51.960 
pigment attracts that light it heats up
and<00:02:50.620> then<00:02:51.160> eventually<00:02:51.460> what's<00:02:51.790> going<00:02:51.940> to

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
and then eventually what's going to

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:53.370 
and then eventually what's going to
happen<00:02:52.330> as<00:02:52.480> you<00:02:52.600> know<00:02:52.720> over<00:02:52.930> the<00:02:52.990> next<00:02:53.050> couple

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380 
happen as you know over the next couple

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:55.830 
happen as you know over the next couple
weeks<00:02:53.650> these<00:02:54.550> brown<00:02:54.760> spots<00:02:54.790> gonna<00:02:55.240> get<00:02:55.420> darker

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
weeks these brown spots gonna get darker

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.300 
weeks these brown spots gonna get darker
almost<00:02:56.020> like<00:02:56.290> coffee<00:02:56.530> ground<00:02:56.920> and<00:02:57.220> then

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
almost like coffee ground and then

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.430 
almost like coffee ground and then
they're<00:02:57.430> gonna<00:02:57.490> flake<00:02:57.760> off<00:02:57.940> okay<00:02:58.720> that<00:02:59.350> looks

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 
they're gonna flake off okay that looks

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:04.260 
they're gonna flake off okay that looks
great<00:03:00.420> Wow<00:03:01.920> happy<00:03:02.920> yeah<00:03:03.640> that's<00:03:04.060> awesome

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:06.130 
wasn't that pain I think it looks even

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:09.000
