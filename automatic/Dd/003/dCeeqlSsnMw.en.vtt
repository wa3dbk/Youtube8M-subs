00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379 
started off it's a bit like if we're

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:09.709 
started off it's a bit like if we're
used<00:00:07.560> to<00:00:07.680> using<00:00:08.099> plasticine<00:00:08.940> you<00:00:09.179> make<00:00:09.360> a<00:00:09.389> big

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
used to using plasticine you make a big

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:12.049 
used to using plasticine you make a big
ball<00:00:09.960> for<00:00:10.710> the<00:00:11.190> bottom<00:00:11.490> part<00:00:11.730> of<00:00:11.790> them<00:00:11.940> which

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
ball for the bottom part of them which

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:14.570 
ball for the bottom part of them which
is<00:00:12.120> basically<00:00:12.509> his<00:00:12.690> tummy<00:00:13.099> then<00:00:14.099> put<00:00:14.400> some

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
is basically his tummy then put some

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.900 
is basically his tummy then put some
water<00:00:14.820> on<00:00:15.150> say<00:00:15.780> flat<00:00:16.080> part<00:00:16.350> here<00:00:16.680> then<00:00:17.520> what<00:00:17.880> I

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
water on say flat part here then what I

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.450 
water on say flat part here then what I
did<00:00:18.029> was<00:00:18.240> I<00:00:18.330> made<00:00:18.480> a<00:00:18.510> smaller<00:00:18.900> ball<00:00:19.199> for<00:00:19.949> the

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
did was I made a smaller ball for the

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.640 
did was I made a smaller ball for the
top<00:00:20.670> part<00:00:20.970> here<00:00:21.210> so<00:00:21.390> we'll<00:00:21.900> just<00:00:22.050> stick<00:00:22.619> that

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
top part here so we'll just stick that

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.029 
top part here so we'll just stick that
down<00:00:22.830> there<00:00:23.250> right<00:00:23.720> then<00:00:24.720> I<00:00:25.109> made<00:00:25.619> a<00:00:25.650> smaller

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
down there right then I made a smaller

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.240 
down there right then I made a smaller
one<00:00:26.250> again<00:00:26.760> still<00:00:27.210> for<00:00:27.840> his<00:00:28.080> nose<00:00:28.320> just<00:00:29.160> like

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
one again still for his nose just like

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.120 
one again still for his nose just like
that<00:00:29.609> so<00:00:30.359> we<00:00:30.449> stick<00:00:30.689> that<00:00:30.810> on<00:00:31.019> there<00:00:31.050> like<00:00:31.590> that

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
that so we stick that on there like that

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:37.389 
that so we stick that on there like that
and<00:00:33.469> then<00:00:34.469> for<00:00:34.829> the<00:00:34.890> arms<00:00:35.250> what<00:00:36.120> I<00:00:36.149> did<00:00:36.420> was<00:00:36.660> I

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
time that you're applying a piece of

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.049 
time that you're applying a piece of
clay<00:00:49.710> to<00:00:49.770> another<00:00:50.160> piece<00:00:50.399> of<00:00:50.520> clay<00:00:50.670> that<00:00:50.700> you

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
clay to another piece of clay that you

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:52.130 
clay to another piece of clay that you
dab<00:00:51.480> it<00:00:51.600> with<00:00:51.719> water

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
dab it with water

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.049 
dab it with water
otherwise<00:00:52.440> it<00:00:52.649> won't<00:00:52.800> stick<00:00:53.160> and<00:00:53.850> what

otherwise it won't stick and what

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.700 
otherwise it won't stick and what
happens<00:00:54.390> is<00:00:54.539> that<00:00:54.660> when<00:00:54.840> it<00:00:54.960> dries<00:00:55.170> out<00:00:55.379> then

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
happens is that when it dries out then

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.590 
happens is that when it dries out then
one<00:00:55.980> of<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.190> pieces<00:00:56.370> that<00:00:56.520> you<00:00:56.670> forgot<00:00:57.059> to<00:00:57.300> add

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
one of the pieces that you forgot to add

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.569 
one of the pieces that you forgot to add
water<00:00:57.899> to<00:00:58.199> will<00:00:58.320> fall<00:00:58.530> off<00:00:58.710> so<00:00:59.370> we're<00:00:59.460> adding

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
water to will fall off so we're adding

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.130 
water to will fall off so we're adding
water<00:00:59.910> to<00:01:00.090> the<00:01:00.210> other<00:01:00.300> one<00:01:00.510> those<00:01:00.690> are<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:00.960> two

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
water to the other one those are the two

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.750 
water to the other one those are the two
legs<00:01:01.949> roughly<00:01:02.609> and<00:01:02.940> then<00:01:03.660> these<00:01:03.899> are<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.080> arms

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:04.760 
legs roughly and then these are the arms

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:10.039 
legs roughly and then these are the arms
slightly<00:01:05.760> smaller<00:01:06.180> for<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.420> arms<00:01:07.430> and<00:01:09.049> there

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
slightly smaller for the arms and there

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.820 
slightly smaller for the arms and there
we<00:01:10.260> go<00:01:10.670> okay<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:12.450> arms<00:01:12.720> and<00:01:13.439> then<00:01:13.619> of<00:01:13.770> course

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
we go okay the arms and then of course

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.760 
we go okay the arms and then of course
the<00:01:14.520> ears<00:01:14.960> and<00:01:15.960> what<00:01:16.170> I've<00:01:16.290> done<00:01:16.439> is<00:01:16.590> it's<00:01:16.740> just

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770

the ears and what I've done is it's just
it's<00:01:17.159> kind<00:01:17.280> of<00:01:17.400> difficult<00:01:17.759> to<00:01:17.790> see<00:01:17.970> but<00:01:18.119> I<00:01:18.180> just

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
it's kind of difficult to see but I just

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:19.999 
it's kind of difficult to see but I just
pinched<00:01:18.780> out<00:01:18.930> two<00:01:19.140> little<00:01:19.259> pieces<00:01:19.560> on<00:01:19.830> top

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
pinched out two little pieces on top

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.210 
pinched out two little pieces on top
here<00:01:20.310> like<00:01:20.340> yours<00:01:20.759> stick<00:01:21.450> them<00:01:21.600> on<00:01:21.689> top<00:01:21.720> there

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:22.220 
here like yours stick them on top there

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:27.980 
here like yours stick them on top there
and<00:01:23.220> again<00:01:25.220> on<00:01:26.220> top<00:01:26.369> like<00:01:26.610> that<00:01:26.640> for<00:01:27.540> the<00:01:27.869> other

and again on top like that for the other

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.980 
and again on top like that for the other
ear<00:01:28.970> so<00:01:29.970> all<00:01:30.090> you<00:01:30.210> have<00:01:30.329> to<00:01:30.479> do<00:01:30.600> then<00:01:30.780> if<00:01:30.900> you

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
ear so all you have to do then if you

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
here that doesn't do it very well if we

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.469 
here that doesn't do it very well if we
try<00:01:40.710> this<00:01:40.770> what<00:01:41.040> this<00:01:41.850> one<00:01:42.030> might<00:01:42.180> do<00:01:42.299> it<00:01:42.360> with
