00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:40.680
 and my plan is a business of 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.370
 production of garden plants for 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.370
 professional 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.620
 the productions and their plans his 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:56.250
 principle based on the range of salads 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:01:03.420
 the gansu and otherwise the upholsteries and 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:07.259
 pears it's about 25 equivalents 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:10.170
 full time 18 permanent 100 million 

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:11.460
 market garden plants in the year mini 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.290
 fashion of which leek rice pavement 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.670
 represents about 50% of volumes 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.180
 and 50% there 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.180
 the salad 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:29.090
 so and plan die in terms of houthi 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:33.409
 has an area of four hectares and neither 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:35.509
 from greenhouse to tool was organized 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:37.430
 in such a way that the circulation 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:40.689
 internally be effective that 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:42.780
 the only optimal automation possible 

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:45.690
 and 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:48.299
 we leaned against the greenhouse of the buildings of 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:50.640
 halls finally three main halls 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:53.420
 storage or manufacturing and a 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.420
 shipping 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.690
 to the producers of seedlings this consists of 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.180
 make a firm commitment our 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:08.759
 customer to deliver us a plan 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:13.610
 corresponding to a specification at 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:13.610
 a precise date and at the expected stage 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.209
 so what are our best 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:25.370
 obviously the reliability of our products 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:28.760
 this is the first branding of 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:31.939
 the company the contribution of the technical follow-up 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:33.860
 and commercial and logistics 

00:02:31.939 --> 00:02:37.190
 because we made the choice to have the 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:39.500
 own fleet that is expensive which 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:41.090
 complicated but that allows to have a 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.360
 impeccable service to 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:43.360
 optics 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.959
 there is a real know-how to go 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:51.109
 in the greenhouses you have to go see 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:53.269
 fowler plants must know how to talk to them 

00:02:51.109 --> 00:02:55.129
 it is important to know how to read them 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:58.969
 which is more complicated so you have to live 

00:02:55.129 --> 00:03:01.939
 with his plans and that's in my opinion the 

00:02:58.969 --> 00:03:04.719
 most sensitive part of our countries and 

00:03:01.939 --> 00:03:04.719
 the most interesting 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:17.210
 I first I was born in the 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:21.110
 production I am from son of 

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:23.450
 vegetable growers and with my dad 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:24.920
 we learned continually 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:26.720
 even in the full sense to length 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:29.209
 years spent in plots for 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:30.860
 look at the board I do not go in 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:32.810
 the greenhouses while walking looking at the 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:36.830
 head in the air we would necessarily make 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:37.760
 chapel guard the plants and we want 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:39.769
 not to say that we know the links we know 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:41.690
 never read them completely but we 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:43.010
 two minutes and inevitably there are 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:44.989
 things to do necessarily there are 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:46.580
 measures to be taken but necessarily it is necessary 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:49.660
 fit for the next day etc 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:49.660
 there is always something to do 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:00.340
 it's a passion his passions and it's 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:02.950
 a passion also to try in 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:05.830
 to find other ways of 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:11.110
 production and trying to imagine this 

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:14.080
 what will be the pollution tomorrow so at the 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:16.090
 next few years is to continue to 

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:17.470
 develop emerald plane in its area 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:19.480
 of action therefore continue to take 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:22.180
 market shares and the second action 

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:24.730
 it is to prepare for the new modes of 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:25.330
 tomorrow's production so continue to 

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:28.510
 to work 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:32.800
 bio because bio brings us 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:33.880
 important technical values â€‹â€‹that we 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:44.440
 give applications of a 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:45.880
 the largest conventional 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:47.230
 satisfaction today actually 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:49.930
 it's still their plan either 

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:53.350
 recognized in its market and has become 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:55.390
 a key player in the west 

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:56.870
 French who is still the biggest 

00:04:55.390 --> 00:05:00.400
 production basins 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:02.270
 in France but my satisfaction is to 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:04.700
 mainly continue to evolve 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:06.830
 our promos what is the most motivating 

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:09.880
 that's what really today and my 

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:09.880
 essence of everyday life
