00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.780 

I<00:00:00.060> wanted<00:00:00.510> to<00:00:00.780> revisit<00:00:01.199> spline<00:00:02.010> waypoints

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:02.790 
I wanted to revisit spline waypoints

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:05.030 
I wanted to revisit spline waypoints
with<00:00:02.970> pick<00:00:03.240> sought<00:00:03.510> from<00:00:03.929> a<00:00:04.259> previous<00:00:04.799> video

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:05.040 
with pick sought from a previous video

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.760 
with pick sought from a previous video
in<00:00:05.490> that<00:00:06.120> video<00:00:06.299> I<00:00:06.480> demonstrated<00:00:07.200> that<00:00:07.410> I<00:00:07.470> set

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
in that video I demonstrated that I set

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.400 
in that video I demonstrated that I set
up<00:00:07.890> a<00:00:07.980> mission<00:00:08.370> here<00:00:08.580> with<00:00:08.790> about<00:00:08.880> 53<00:00:09.750> spline

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
up a mission here with about 53 spline

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.580 
up a mission here with about 53 spline
waypoints<00:00:11.190> and<00:00:11.190> then<00:00:12.059> showed<00:00:12.780> the<00:00:13.080> output<00:00:13.559> of

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
waypoints and then showed the output of

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.029 
waypoints and then showed the output of
that<00:00:13.860> video<00:00:14.130> as<00:00:14.660> the<00:00:15.660> hexacopter<00:00:16.139> flew<00:00:16.800> down

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
that video as the hexacopter flew down

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.660 
that video as the hexacopter flew down
the<00:00:17.520> creek<00:00:17.880> now<00:00:18.539> one<00:00:19.260> of<00:00:19.289> my<00:00:19.439> thoughts<00:00:20.250> was

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
the creek now one of my thoughts was

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.029 
the creek now one of my thoughts was
that<00:00:20.970> I<00:00:21.270> had<00:00:21.810> way<00:00:22.020> too<00:00:22.080> many<00:00:22.350> waypoints<00:00:23.039> and

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
that I had way too many waypoints and

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.099 
that I had way too many waypoints and
several<00:00:23.699> of<00:00:23.820> you<00:00:23.970> confirm<00:00:24.539> that<00:00:24.810> and

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
several of you confirm that and

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.200 
several of you confirm that and
suggested<00:00:25.740> that<00:00:25.890> I<00:00:25.949> reduced<00:00:26.490> the<00:00:26.730> number<00:00:27.180> of

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
suggested that I reduced the number of

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.960 
suggested that I reduced the number of
them<00:00:27.539> and<00:00:27.810> thank<00:00:28.619> you<00:00:28.769> guys<00:00:28.949> for<00:00:29.010> that<00:00:29.519> great

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
them and thank you guys for that great

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.440 
them and thank you guys for that great
feedback<00:00:30.300> you<00:00:30.720> can<00:00:30.750> see<00:00:31.109> here<00:00:31.439> I<00:00:31.590> have<00:00:32.450> about

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
feedback you can see here I have about

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.750 
feedback you can see here I have about
one-fourth<00:00:34.380> the<00:00:34.680> number<00:00:35.160> of<00:00:35.370> spline

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
one-fourth the number of spline

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.869 
one-fourth the number of spline
waypoints<00:00:36.480> that<00:00:36.750> I<00:00:36.780> had<00:00:37.079> originally<00:00:37.590> I<00:00:38.219> also

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
waypoints that I had originally I also

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.569 
waypoints that I had originally I also
decided<00:00:39.360> to<00:00:39.690> reduce<00:00:39.840> the<00:00:40.230> altitude<00:00:40.829> from<00:00:41.219> 30

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
decided to reduce the altitude from 30

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.880 
decided to reduce the altitude from 30
meters<00:00:41.969> to<00:00:42.239> 25<00:00:42.780> meters<00:00:42.989> so<00:00:43.379> we<00:00:43.530> can<00:00:43.710> get<00:00:43.829> a

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
meters to 25 meters so we can get a

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.670 
meters to 25 meters so we can get a
little<00:00:44.760> bit<00:00:44.969> closer<00:00:45.300> look<00:00:45.690> at<00:00:45.840> this<00:00:45.989> Creek<00:00:46.410> and

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
little bit closer look at this Creek and

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.250 
little bit closer look at this Creek and
in<00:00:47.520> addition<00:00:47.640> to<00:00:48.180> reducing<00:00:48.480> the<00:00:48.930> number<00:00:49.110> of

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
in addition to reducing the number of

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.610 
in addition to reducing the number of
spline<00:00:49.739> waypoints<00:00:50.489> I<00:00:50.670> actually<00:00:51.329> change<00:00:52.140> this

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
spline waypoints I actually change this

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.310 
spline waypoints I actually change this
WP<00:00:53.520> yah<00:00:53.820> behavior<00:00:54.660> by<00:00:55.500> default<00:00:55.920> it<00:00:56.340> was<00:00:56.520> set<00:00:56.789> at

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:57.320 
WP yah behavior by default it was set at

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.770 
WP yah behavior by default it was set at
24<00:00:58.320> my<00:00:58.469> firmware<00:00:58.770> load<00:00:59.190> and<00:00:59.489> I<00:00:59.850> changed<00:01:00.390> it<00:01:00.510> to

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
24 my firmware load and I changed it to

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.110 
24 my firmware load and I changed it to
three<00:01:01.140> now<00:01:01.739> that<00:01:01.920> was<00:01:02.039> a<00:01:02.070> suggestion<00:01:02.609> from

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
three now that was a suggestion from

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.800 
three now that was a suggestion from
youtube<00:01:03.570> user<00:01:03.870> warsi<00:01:04.530> and<00:01:04.790> a<00:01:05.790> quick<00:01:06.090> bit<00:01:06.360> about

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
youtube user warsi and a quick bit about

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.399 
youtube user warsi and a quick bit about
this<00:01:07.110> WP<00:01:07.890> yah<00:01:08.159> behavior<00:01:09.030> you'll<00:01:09.659> see<00:01:09.990> the

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
this WP yah behavior you'll see the

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.130 
this WP yah behavior you'll see the
different<00:01:10.770> values<00:01:11.220> and<00:01:11.780> previously<00:01:12.780> I<00:01:12.900> was

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
different values and previously I was

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.060 
different values and previously I was
set<00:01:13.409> face<00:01:13.890> next<00:01:14.220> waypoint<00:01:14.790> except<00:01:15.540> RTL<00:01:16.110> and<00:01:16.409> in

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
set face next waypoint except RTL and in

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.859 
set face next waypoint except RTL and in
this<00:01:17.159> case<00:01:17.369> I<00:01:17.549> changed<00:01:17.970> it<00:01:18.090> to<00:01:18.270> face<00:01:18.509> a<00:01:18.540> long

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
this case I changed it to face a long

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.130 
this case I changed it to face a long
GPS<00:01:19.439> course<00:01:19.950> so<00:01:20.369> we<00:01:20.700> would<00:01:20.820> get<00:01:21.000> a<00:01:21.210> more

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
GPS course so we would get a more

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.710 
GPS course so we would get a more
natural<00:01:22.710> looking<00:01:23.100> video<00:01:23.430> down<00:01:23.729> the<00:01:23.909> creek<00:01:24.210> and

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
natural looking video down the creek and

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.890 
natural looking video down the creek and
what<00:01:25.470> I<00:01:25.500> want<00:01:25.680> to<00:01:25.799> do<00:01:25.979> is<00:01:26.220> show<00:01:27.119> you<00:01:27.180> this

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
what I want to do is show you this

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.249 
what I want to do is show you this
mission<00:01:28.530> from<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:29.820> camera<00:01:30.360> in<00:01:30.570> the<00:01:30.750> air<00:01:30.900> I

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
mission from the camera in the air I

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.469 
mission from the camera in the air I
actually<00:01:31.740> flew<00:01:32.189> this<00:01:32.490> time<00:01:32.790> from<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.210> south

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
actually flew this time from the south

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.469 
actually flew this time from the south
of<00:01:33.659> the<00:01:33.780> creek<00:01:34.079> to<00:01:34.470> the<00:01:34.619> north<00:01:34.890> and<00:01:35.220> I<00:01:36.180> think

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
of the creek to the north and I think

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.050 
of the creek to the north and I think
you'll<00:01:36.630> notice<00:01:36.960> that<00:01:37.100> there<00:01:38.100> is<00:01:38.130> a<00:01:38.460> lot<00:01:38.820> less

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
you'll notice that there is a lot less

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.319 
you'll notice that there is a lot less
jerkiness<00:01:39.600> the<00:01:40.200> video<00:01:40.799> looks<00:01:41.189> a<00:01:41.460> lot<00:01:42.270> more

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
jerkiness the video looks a lot more

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.399 
jerkiness the video looks a lot more
human<00:01:42.990> and<00:01:43.200> natural<00:01:43.470> in<00:01:44.070> the<00:01:44.729> flight<00:01:45.409> you're

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
human and natural in the flight you're

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.740 
human and natural in the flight you're
going<00:01:46.590> to<00:01:46.680> see<00:01:46.860> it<00:01:47.009> at<00:01:47.159> 2x<00:01:47.640> speed<00:01:47.850> just<00:01:48.390> because

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
going to see it at 2x speed just because

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.899 
going to see it at 2x speed just because
the<00:01:49.110> full<00:01:49.560> flight<00:01:49.860> was<00:01:50.070> about<00:01:50.369> three<00:01:50.790> and<00:01:50.820> a

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
the full flight was about three and a

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.999 
the full flight was about three and a
half<00:01:50.970> minutes<00:01:51.329> and<00:01:51.840> didn't<00:01:52.500> want<00:01:52.649> to<00:01:52.710> bore<00:01:52.829> you

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
half minutes and didn't want to bore you

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.100 
half minutes and didn't want to bore you
guys<00:01:53.040> with<00:01:53.220> that<00:01:53.640> but<00:01:54.270> definitely<00:01:54.869> take<00:01:55.079> a
