absolutely<00:01:06.060> awesome<00:01:06.450> gun<00:01:07.049> I<00:01:07.290> had<00:01:07.860> really<00:01:08.070> used

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
absolutely awesome gun I had really used

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.070 
absolutely awesome gun I had really used
it<00:01:08.490> much<00:01:08.640> in<00:01:08.939> my<00:01:09.229> first<00:01:10.229> prestige<00:01:10.939> but<00:01:11.939> i<00:01:12.420> think

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
it much in my first prestige but i think

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.450 
it much in my first prestige but i think
i'm<00:01:13.140> going<00:01:13.260> to<00:01:13.350> use<00:01:13.439> it<00:01:13.560> quite<00:01:13.710> a<00:01:13.770> lot<00:01:14.010> when<00:01:14.430> I

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
i'm going to use it quite a lot when I

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.570 
i'm going to use it quite a lot when I
prestige<00:01:14.880> next<00:01:15.240> time<00:01:15.770> and<00:01:16.770> I've<00:01:17.369> got<00:01:17.549> the

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
prestige next time and I've got the

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.850 
prestige next time and I've got the
silencer<00:01:18.060> equipped<00:01:18.390> and<00:01:18.659> it's<00:01:19.200> but<00:01:19.560> i<00:01:19.590> think

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
silencer equipped and it's but i think

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.530 
silencer equipped and it's but i think
that<00:01:19.890> lowers<00:01:20.250> recoil<00:01:20.759> it<00:01:20.880> feels<00:01:21.060> like<00:01:21.270> it<00:01:21.390> does

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
that lowers recoil it feels like it does

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.480 
that lowers recoil it feels like it does
anyway<00:01:21.840> because<00:01:22.110> before<00:01:22.890> I<00:01:22.950> could<00:01:23.159> get<00:01:23.310> many

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
anyway because before I could get many

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.320 
anyway because before I could get many
kills<00:01:23.729> with<00:01:23.909> it<00:01:24.030> finding<00:01:24.450> really<00:01:24.720> hard<00:01:26.330> yeah

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
kills with it finding really hard yeah

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.679

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
have been recommended to use the m93

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:22.360 
have been recommended to use the m93
raffica<00:02:20.420> because<00:02:21.140> i'm<00:02:21.200> not<00:02:21.350> using<00:02:21.530> steady<00:02:22.160> aim

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:29.710 
but I really can't use the m93 rafiqul I
find<00:02:26.720> it<00:02:26.810> really<00:02:26.900> hard<00:02:27.170> this<00:02:28.210> it<00:02:29.210> just<00:02:29.480> really

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
find it really hard this it just really

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.080 
find it really hard this it just really
irritates<00:02:30.170> me<00:02:30.440> I<00:02:30.590> find<00:02:30.980> the<00:02:31.100> usps<00:02:31.640> a<00:02:31.790> lot

irritates me I find the usps a lot

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:37.300 
irritates me I find the usps a lot
easier<00:02:32.270> to<00:02:32.570> use<00:02:32.900> than<00:02:34.270> the<00:02:35.770> things<00:02:36.770> this<00:02:37.130> is<00:02:37.280> a

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
easier to use than the things this is a

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:38.770 
easier to use than the things this is a
stupid<00:02:37.580> death<00:02:37.940> here<00:02:38.120> I<00:02:38.270> should<00:02:38.510> have<00:02:38.630> checked

about well crap I've actually forgotten
now<00:02:51.920> in<00:02:52.130> a<00:02:52.220> mud<00:02:54.070> shooting<00:02:55.070> at<00:02:55.190> range<00:02:55.460> with<00:02:55.820> the

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:55.850 
now in a mud shooting at range with the

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:58.480 
now in a mud shooting at range with the
mp5k<00:02:56.480> is<00:02:56.840> a<00:02:56.870> bad<00:02:57.080> idea<00:02:57.110> so<00:02:57.710> if<00:02:57.830> that's<00:02:58.070> even

00:02:58.480 --> 00:02:58.490 
mp5k is a bad idea so if that's even

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:01.390 
mp5k is a bad idea so if that's even
that<00:02:58.880> is<00:02:59.060> a<00:02:59.090> bit<00:02:59.270> long<00:02:59.450> range<00:02:59.860> to<00:03:00.860> try<00:03:01.070> and<00:03:01.220> kill

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
that is a bit long range to try and kill

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.490 
that is a bit long range to try and kill
people<00:03:01.580> are<00:03:02.060> sort<00:03:02.330> of<00:03:02.420> debating<00:03:03.260> whether<00:03:03.410> i

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 
people are sort of debating whether i

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.950 
people are sort of debating whether i
should<00:03:03.650> leave<00:03:04.490> that<00:03:04.550> guy<00:03:05.000> or<00:03:05.300> try<00:03:05.690> and<00:03:05.810> take

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:05.960 
should leave that guy or try and take

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:08.290 
should leave that guy or try and take

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.400 
I find the USP 45 s a lot easier to use

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:22.030 
I find the USP 45 s a lot easier to use
because<00:03:19.730> oh<00:03:20.240> here's<00:03:21.170> another<00:03:21.290> stupid<00:03:21.710> death<00:03:21.860> I

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.040 
because oh here's another stupid death I

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:23.410 
because oh here's another stupid death I
should<00:03:22.220> have<00:03:22.340> gone<00:03:22.400> in<00:03:22.580> to<00:03:22.670> cover<00:03:22.850> here<00:03:22.970> so<00:03:23.390> I

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.420 
should have gone in to cover here so I

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:26.710 
should have gone in to cover here so I
get<00:03:23.570> shot<00:03:23.810> down<00:03:23.840> that<00:03:24.170> massive<00:03:24.500> corridor<00:03:25.720> just

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 
get shot down that massive corridor just

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.560 
get shot down that massive corridor just
looking<00:03:26.930> for<00:03:27.050> that<00:03:27.170> guy<00:03:27.460> the<00:03:28.460> USP<00:03:28.850> 45<00:03:29.180> s<00:03:29.480> I

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:29.570 
looking for that guy the USP 45 s I

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:31.000 
looking for that guy the USP 45 s I
don't<00:03:29.750> think<00:03:29.930> they<00:03:30.020> need<00:03:30.200> steady<00:03:30.500> aim<00:03:30.710> really

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.010 
don't think they need steady aim really

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:32.350 
don't think they need steady aim really
because<00:03:31.160> the<00:03:31.280> aiming<00:03:31.550> reticule<00:03:31.910> czar<00:03:32.150> pretty

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:32.360 
because the aiming reticule czar pretty

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:34.060 
because the aiming reticule czar pretty
small<00:03:32.690> and<00:03:33.350> you're<00:03:33.470> only<00:03:33.590> going<00:03:33.740> to<00:03:33.800> pull<00:03:33.980> them

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:34.070 
small and you're only going to pull them

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:36.880 
small and you're only going to pull them
out<00:03:34.160> if<00:03:34.310> you're<00:03:34.460> at<00:03:34.580> close<00:03:34.790> range<00:03:35.650> or<00:03:36.650> if<00:03:36.800> you

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:36.890 
out if you're at close range or if you

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:39.100 
out if you're at close range or if you
run<00:03:37.070> out<00:03:37.100> of<00:03:37.220> ammo<00:03:37.610> but<00:03:38.270> you'll<00:03:38.600> see<00:03:38.870> in<00:03:38.990> a<00:03:39.080> bit

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:39.110 
run out of ammo but you'll see in a bit

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:41.320 
run out of ammo but you'll see in a bit
that<00:03:39.440> I<00:03:39.470> am<00:03:39.740> still<00:03:40.580> managed<00:03:40.850> to<00:03:40.880> get<00:03:41.060> kills

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:41.330 
that I am still managed to get kills

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:43.420 
that I am still managed to get kills
like<00:03:41.570> all<00:03:41.720> the<00:03:41.810> way<00:03:41.900> down<00:03:42.140> this<00:03:42.320> hallway<00:03:42.890> here

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.430 
like all the way down this hallway here

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:47.680 
like all the way down this hallway here
without<00:03:44.360> much<00:03:45.140> of<00:03:45.170> a<00:03:45.350> problem<00:03:46.120> I<00:03:47.120> could<00:03:47.540> hear

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:47.690 
without much of a problem I could hear

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:50.890 
without much of a problem I could hear
people<00:03:48.280> running<00:03:49.280> around<00:03:49.340> the<00:03:50.330> building<00:03:50.720> and<00:03:50.780> I

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:50.900 
people running around the building and I

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:52.180 
people running around the building and I
didn't<00:03:51.050> know<00:03:51.140> where<00:03:51.320> they<00:03:51.440> were<00:03:51.470> so<00:03:51.800> I<00:03:51.830> decided

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:52.190 
didn't know where they were so I decided

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:53.890 
didn't know where they were so I decided
that<00:03:52.400> little<00:03:52.970> corner<00:03:53.180> there<00:03:53.450> next<00:03:53.660> to<00:03:53.840> the

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:53.900 
that little corner there next to the

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:55.270 
that little corner there next to the
stairs<00:03:54.200> and<00:03:54.350> that<00:03:54.530> little<00:03:54.800> hole<00:03:54.980> in<00:03:55.010> the<00:03:55.160> wall

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:55.280 
stairs and that little hole in the wall

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:57.070 
stairs and that little hole in the wall
is<00:03:55.580> a<00:03:55.610> really<00:03:55.880> good<00:03:56.000> place<00:03:56.210> to<00:03:56.390> sit<00:03:56.630> if<00:03:56.870> you're

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:57.080 
is a really good place to sit if you're

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:59.110 
is a really good place to sit if you're
listening<00:03:57.260> out<00:03:57.620> for<00:03:57.650> people<00:03:57.980> coming<00:03:58.220> could

00:03:59.110 --> 00:03:59.120 
listening out for people coming could

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:00.760 
listening out for people coming could
hear<00:03:59.270> a<00:03:59.300> guy<00:03:59.480> underneath<00:03:59.750> me<00:04:00.080> so<00:04:00.230> I<00:04:00.260> decided<00:04:00.620> to

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:00.770 
hear a guy underneath me so I decided to

we're<00:04:25.349> especially<00:04:25.770> using<00:04:26.370> a<00:04:26.520> class<00:04:26.699> with

00:04:26.869 --> 00:04:26.879

steady aim this Lobby was quite good

00:04:31.979 --> 00:04:34.070 
steady aim this Lobby was quite good
because<00:04:32.280> barely<00:04:32.909> anyone<00:04:33.270> was<00:04:33.419> using<00:04:33.690> ninja

best value killstreaks probably the

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:55.850 
best value killstreaks probably the
hairiest<00:05:54.360> because<00:05:54.750> they're<00:05:54.990> really<00:05:55.409> powerful

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:55.860 
hairiest because they're really powerful

for a seven kill streak as you can see
here<00:06:00.389> I'm<00:06:00.479> sort<00:06:00.690> of<00:06:00.719> getting<00:06:00.840> a<00:06:00.990> bit<00:06:01.110> anxious

00:06:01.279 --> 00:06:01.289 
here I'm sort of getting a bit anxious

00:06:01.289 --> 00:06:04.159 
here I'm sort of getting a bit anxious
because<00:06:01.770> I<00:06:01.919> know<00:06:01.979> that<00:06:02.370> the<00:06:02.639> I'm<00:06:03.150> nearing<00:06:03.990> the

00:06:04.159 --> 00:06:04.169 
because I know that the I'm nearing the

00:06:04.169 --> 00:06:07.279 
because I know that the I'm nearing the
score<00:06:04.469> limit<00:06:05.240> this<00:06:06.240> yeah<00:06:06.779> another<00:06:07.020> big

score limit this yeah another big

00:06:07.289 --> 00:06:09.290

mistake<00:06:07.680> that<00:06:07.979> I've<00:06:08.069> realized<00:06:08.520> now<00:06:08.759> is<00:06:08.940> don't

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:09.300 
mistake that I've realized now is don't

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:12.529 
mistake that I've realized now is don't
use<00:06:09.509> the<00:06:09.599> ump45<00:06:10.229> of<00:06:10.560> that<00:06:10.680> UMP<00:06:11.490> mp5k<00:06:12.090> at<00:06:12.360> that

use the ump45 of that UMP mp5k at that
kind<00:06:12.750> of<00:06:12.810> range<00:06:12.960> because<00:06:13.259> you<00:06:13.349> will<00:06:13.469> get<00:06:13.590> taken

00:06:13.969 --> 00:06:13.979 
kind of range because you will get taken

00:06:13.979 --> 00:06:17.629 
kind of range because you will get taken
out<00:06:14.069> by<00:06:14.310> a<00:06:14.699> guy<00:06:14.909> like<00:06:15.090> that<00:06:16.219> see<00:06:17.219> I'm<00:06:17.400> getting<00:06:17.610> a
