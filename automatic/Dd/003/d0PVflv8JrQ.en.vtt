00:01:16.959 --> 00:01:16.969 
so far in the first four stocks now I

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:18.580 
so far in the first four stocks now I
know<00:01:17.119> Kenneth<00:01:17.659> Tohu<00:01:18.049> we'll<00:01:18.200> see<00:01:18.380> in<00:01:18.439> a<00:01:18.500> minute

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:18.590

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
scene this year Charlie Kenneth so a

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:25.850 
scene this year Charlie Kenneth so a
good<00:02:18.840> chance<00:02:19.110> of<00:02:19.230> finishing<00:02:19.410> top<00:02:24.620> so<00:02:25.620> it's<00:02:25.770> not

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
good chance of finishing top so it's not

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.800 
good chance of finishing top so it's not
often<00:02:26.100> that<00:02:26.160> we<00:02:26.280> get<00:02:26.459> to<00:02:26.610> see<00:02:26.790> this<00:02:26.970> race<00:02:27.270> only

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810
