00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:36.239 
as you might expect and like Dig Dug the
enemies<00:02:34.599> become<00:02:35.019> far<00:02:35.349> more<00:02:35.529> aggressive<00:02:36.040> and

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:36.249 
enemies become far more aggressive and

00:02:36.249 --> 00:02:38.640 
enemies become far more aggressive and
faster<00:02:36.790> as<00:02:36.969> the<00:02:37.150> game<00:02:37.359> progresses<00:02:37.779> it's

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
faster as the game progresses it's

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.500 
faster as the game progresses it's
fairly<00:02:38.950> easy<00:02:39.069> to<00:02:39.370> kill<00:02:39.819> off<00:02:39.969> enemies<00:02:40.329> with

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
fairly easy to kill off enemies with

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:42.149 
fairly easy to kill off enemies with
your<00:02:40.689> super<00:02:41.139> ball<00:02:41.349> but<00:02:41.620> you<00:02:41.769> are<00:02:41.919> left

00:02:42.149 --> 00:02:42.159 
your super ball but you are left

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:45.149 
your super ball but you are left
vulnerable<00:02:42.489> until<00:02:42.999> it<00:02:43.299> returns<00:02:44.230> especially

00:02:45.149 --> 00:02:45.159 
vulnerable until it returns especially

00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:47.369

if<00:02:45.700> it's<00:02:45.819> bouncing<00:02:46.269> around<00:02:46.329> the<00:02:46.749> screen<00:02:47.169> when

00:02:47.369 --> 00:02:47.379 
if it's bouncing around the screen when

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:49.440 
if it's bouncing around the screen when
you<00:02:47.559> really<00:02:47.859> need<00:02:48.069> it<00:02:48.099> on<00:02:48.430> the<00:02:48.909> other<00:02:49.029> hand<00:02:49.269> it

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
you really need it on the other hand it

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:51.179 
you really need it on the other hand it
can<00:02:49.540> also<00:02:49.719> act<00:02:49.989> like<00:02:50.230> a<00:02:50.260> heat-seeking<00:02:50.499> missile

00:02:51.179 --> 00:02:51.189 
can also act like a heat-seeking missile

00:02:51.189 --> 00:02:53.339 
can also act like a heat-seeking missile
so<00:02:52.180> you<00:02:52.239> launch<00:02:52.480> it<00:02:52.629> out<00:02:52.749> there<00:02:52.959> and<00:02:53.109> know<00:02:53.200> that

00:02:53.339 --> 00:02:53.349 
so you launch it out there and know that

00:02:53.349 --> 00:03:01.559 
so you launch it out there and know that
it'll<00:02:53.529> eventually<00:02:54.099> kill<00:02:54.579> something<00:03:00.569> another

00:03:01.559 --> 00:03:01.569 
it'll eventually kill something another
