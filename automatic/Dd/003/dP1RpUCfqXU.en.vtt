semi-realistic<00:05:55.639> cockatiel<00:05:56.680> face<00:05:58.599> you're<00:05:59.599> not

00:05:59.619 --> 00:05:59.629 
semi-realistic cockatiel face you're not

00:05:59.629 --> 00:06:02.290 
semi-realistic cockatiel face you're not
gonna<00:05:59.960> want<00:06:00.289> to<00:06:00.349> forget<00:06:00.830> to<00:06:01.069> color<00:06:01.310> just<00:06:02.000> with

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:02.300 
gonna want to forget to color just with

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:05.920 
gonna want to forget to color just with
color<00:06:02.620> it's<00:06:03.620> an<00:06:03.800> entire<00:06:04.220> universe<00:06:05.210> you<00:06:05.750> could

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:05.930 
color it's an entire universe you could

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:09.159 
color it's an entire universe you could
do<00:06:06.020> whatever<00:06:06.169> you<00:06:06.620> possibly<00:06:07.220> want<00:06:07.870> all<00:06:08.870> right

do whatever you possibly want all right

00:06:09.169 --> 00:06:12.129 
do whatever you possibly want all right
so<00:06:09.530> basically<00:06:09.949> I<00:06:10.370> decided<00:06:11.090> to<00:06:11.810> draw<00:06:12.080> the

00:06:12.129 --> 00:06:12.139 
so basically I decided to draw the

00:06:12.139 --> 00:06:15.339 
so basically I decided to draw the
natural<00:06:12.740> colors<00:06:13.099> of<00:06:13.129> a<00:06:13.490> cockatiel<00:06:13.940> and<00:06:14.810> of

00:06:15.339 --> 00:06:15.349 
natural colors of a cockatiel and of

00:06:15.349 --> 00:06:17.080 
natural colors of a cockatiel and of
course<00:06:15.800> because<00:06:16.220> it's<00:06:16.400> your<00:06:16.580> drawing<00:06:16.849> you

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:17.090 
course because it's your drawing you

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:19.230 
course because it's your drawing you
could<00:06:17.240> do<00:06:17.300> whatever<00:06:17.479> colors<00:06:18.110> your<00:06:18.289> one<00:06:18.560> or

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:19.240 
could do whatever colors your one or
