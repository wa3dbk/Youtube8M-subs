00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
to tell you about a brand new app from

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.609 
to tell you about a brand new app from
mine<00:00:28.260> shapes<00:00:28.560> called<00:00:29.010> Sid<00:00:29.939> the<00:00:30.090> Science<00:00:30.330> Kid

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:30.619 
mine shapes called Sid the Science Kid

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:33.920 
mine shapes called Sid the Science Kid
SIDS<00:00:31.619> slide<00:00:32.189> to<00:00:32.340> the<00:00:32.399> side<00:00:32.660> do<00:00:33.660> you<00:00:33.750> like<00:00:33.899> that

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
SIDS slide to the side do you like that

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.080 
SIDS slide to the side do you like that
you<00:00:34.290> ever<00:00:34.940> yeah<00:00:35.989> the<00:00:36.989> app<00:00:37.230> is<00:00:37.559> based<00:00:38.430> on<00:00:38.670> an

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
you ever yeah the app is based on an

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.010 
you ever yeah the app is based on an
episode<00:00:39.629> that<00:00:40.020> PBS<00:00:40.680> Aaron<00:00:41.250> from<00:00:41.910> the<00:00:42.450> Science

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
episode that PBS Aaron from the Science

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.940 
episode that PBS Aaron from the Science
Kid<00:00:43.230> and<00:00:43.559> it<00:00:44.690> teaches<00:00:45.690> children<00:00:46.140> about<00:00:46.469> one<00:00:46.920> of

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
Kid and it teaches children about one of

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.420 
Kid and it teaches children about one of
the<00:00:47.250> scientific<00:00:48.239> principles<00:00:48.840> of<00:00:49.079> fiction<00:00:49.620> so

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
the scientific principles of fiction so

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.029 
the scientific principles of fiction so
throw<00:00:51.059> this<00:00:51.360> up<00:00:51.480> there<00:00:51.960> are<00:00:52.110> stories<00:00:52.590> there

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
throw this up there are stories there

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.490 
throw this up there are stories there
are<00:00:53.160> mini<00:00:53.340> games<00:00:53.640> and<00:00:54.149> there's<00:00:54.840> even<00:00:54.960> a<00:00:55.199> song

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
are mini games and there's even a song

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.639 
are mini games and there's even a song
and<00:00:56.010> all<00:00:56.550> of<00:00:56.789> these<00:00:57.079> interactive<00:00:58.079> experiences

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
and all of these interactive experiences

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.709 
and all of these interactive experiences
are<00:00:58.859> designed<00:00:59.280> to<00:00:59.550> teach<00:01:00.120> children<00:01:00.149> about

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
are designed to teach children about

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.410 
are designed to teach children about
friction<00:01:01.230> so<00:01:02.190> let<00:01:02.430> me<00:01:02.550> show<00:01:02.760> you<00:01:02.789> with<00:01:03.390> my

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
friction so let me show you with my

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.620 
friction so let me show you with my
daughter<00:01:03.799> one<00:01:04.799> of<00:01:04.920> the<00:01:05.070> mini<00:01:05.250> games<00:01:05.540> can<00:01:06.540> you

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
daughter one of the mini games can you

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:35.539 
daughter one of the mini games can you
show<00:01:06.810> me<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:06.990> game<00:01:23.960> she<00:01:24.960> was<00:01:25.080> a<00:01:34.430> she<00:01:35.430> was

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
show me the game she was a she was

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:53.570 
show me the game she was a she was
a<00:01:35.579> good

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:53.580 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:57.120 

so<00:01:54.580> as<00:01:54.730> you<00:01:54.880> can<00:01:55.030> see<00:01:55.210> the<00:01:55.420> app<00:01:55.600> is<00:01:55.930> an<00:01:56.740> engaging

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.130 
so as you can see the app is an engaging

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:58.520 
so as you can see the app is an engaging
way<00:01:57.310> if<00:01:57.490> their<00:01:57.670> children<00:01:57.820> to<00:01:58.120> learn<00:01:58.270> about

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
way if their children to learn about

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.140 
way if their children to learn about
science<00:01:59.530> and<00:02:00.130> in<00:02:00.370> this<00:02:00.520> particular<00:02:00.670> instance

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:01.150 
science and in this particular instance

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:05.130 
science and in this particular instance
friction<00:02:02.310> they<00:02:03.310> hear<00:02:03.700> the<00:02:03.790> story<00:02:04.060> and<00:02:04.420> they

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:05.140 
friction they hear the story and they

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:07.620 
friction they hear the story and they
hear<00:02:05.560> a<00:02:05.590> concept<00:02:06.040> and<00:02:06.340> then<00:02:06.580> they<00:02:06.910> apply<00:02:07.240> it<00:02:07.300> by

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.630 
hear a concept and then they apply it by

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:09.870 
hear a concept and then they apply it by
playing<00:02:07.900> the<00:02:08.140> games<00:02:08.380> my<00:02:09.190> daughter's<00:02:09.490> three

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:09.880 
playing the games my daughter's three

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:11.850 
playing the games my daughter's three
and<00:02:10.180> she<00:02:10.510> was<00:02:10.630> easily<00:02:11.020> able<00:02:11.080> to<00:02:11.410> figure<00:02:11.560> it<00:02:11.710> out

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
and she was easily able to figure it out

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:13.260 
and she was easily able to figure it out
as<00:02:12.010> you<00:02:12.100> can<00:02:12.280> see<00:02:12.430> she's<00:02:12.700> playing<00:02:13.000> the<00:02:13.120> game

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
as you can see she's playing the game

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:15.690 
as you can see she's playing the game
right<00:02:13.300> now<00:02:13.890> she<00:02:14.890> kind<00:02:15.040> of<00:02:15.130> goes<00:02:15.280> back<00:02:15.340> and

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
right now she kind of goes back and

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.820 
right now she kind of goes back and
forth<00:02:15.730> between<00:02:15.970> the<00:02:16.150> story<00:02:16.420> in<00:02:16.540> the<00:02:16.630> games<00:02:16.870> my

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
forth between the story in the games my

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:19.230 
forth between the story in the games my
son<00:02:18.070> actually<00:02:18.250> really<00:02:18.760> really<00:02:18.850> enjoys<00:02:19.210> the
