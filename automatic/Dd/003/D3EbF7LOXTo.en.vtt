00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:09.940
 to the girls like the extensive temporary 

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:12.160
 for super good I am fine and if not 

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:13.480
 well known and given nine to the channel and 

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.280
 how have you seen yourself for the title of 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:17.230
 video today I bring you one day something there is a 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:19.240
 tutorial this tutorial is to be combined 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:21.130
 at the ends of the road with paper 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:23.109
 although they do not clarify it with paper that can 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:24.369
 Give your hair and it looks super good 

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:26.859
 all that depends on the color of your hair 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:29.620
 be clearer the more you pick up the tone and 

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:31.570
 obviously the tips besieged 

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:36.090
 but as you and I have the 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:36.090
 hair tips little heads 

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:45.700
 in the tips cases and the signal in a 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:47.110
 color of this and I stay here and now 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:48.940
 that has made it clear to me 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:50.260
 different from market like this for this 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:52.270
 hair painting method 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:54.550
 I want you to give them that you do not mistreat them anymore 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:56.260
 which is only water with tape or with color 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:58.930
 so keep that because more treat it 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:00.580
 It lasts approximately 3 or 4 washes and 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:03.780
 girls if you want to know how it's done is 

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:07.590
 that you are going to need plastic boats 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:10.759
 crepe paper of the color you want 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.759
 and some scissors 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:16.200
 let's start cutting all your paper 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.200
 in small strips 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:23.960
 until you have something more or less like this 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.960
 i 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:29.329
 then with a comb we are going to untangle 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.060
 all your hair so that the grip 

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:32.950
 painting better 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:35.770
 until it is well untangled 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:37.479
 later I decided to make two little butts and 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:39.750
 tie the league to where he wanted the 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:39.750
 colour 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:45.610
 now you are going to fill your bottles with 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:48.250
 water for less than half and you're going to 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:49.840
 fill them with color I used a 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:51.480
 stick for the painting to be released 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.670
 best 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:56.010
 then they will grab the paper and they will 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.420
 to take out and they will squeeze it can use 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:59.840
 gloves for the north that in the hands 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.840
 like me 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.700
 and the only thing left for you to do is 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:06.060
 Put all your hair in the water with 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.060
 ink 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.829
 and so you 're going to stay at least 30 

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:16.829
 minutes 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.690
 since the 30 minutes have passed for 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:26.110
 Take your hair out of the water and you're going to 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.110
 squeeze 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:36.310
 I will not make your hair shine anymore 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:38.500
 and I'm going to let it dry, you can leave it 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.770
 air dry or you can take a 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.770
 dryer 

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:54.730
 Y 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.490
 and how can you see this was the result 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:04.200
 final 

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:06.060
 Y 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.160
