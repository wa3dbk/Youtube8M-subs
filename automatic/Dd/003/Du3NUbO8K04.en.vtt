out I wish I could but I can't just say
I<00:00:57.980> think<00:00:58.220> I'll<00:00:58.580> start<00:00:58.880> a<00:00:58.970> masterpiece<00:00:59.780> and

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:00.020 
I think I'll start a masterpiece and

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:02.410 
I think I'll start a masterpiece and
make<00:01:00.260> it<00:01:00.500> now<00:01:00.710> cuz<00:01:01.460> it<00:01:01.670> doesn't<00:01:01.910> turn<00:01:02.180> out<00:01:02.390> that

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:02.420 
make it now cuz it doesn't turn out that

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.620 
make it now cuz it doesn't turn out that
way<00:01:02.960> but<00:01:03.560> if<00:01:03.860> I<00:01:04.070> make<00:01:04.280> a<00:01:04.309> lot<00:01:04.699> of<00:01:04.879> things<00:01:05.150> and<00:01:05.540> I

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:05.630 
way but if I make a lot of things and I

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:07.539 
way but if I make a lot of things and I
finish<00:01:06.049> them<00:01:06.409> and<00:01:06.560> I<00:01:06.619> live<00:01:06.890> with<00:01:07.159> them<00:01:07.310> and<00:01:07.490> I

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:07.549

look<00:01:07.729> back<00:01:08.060> at<00:01:08.299> them<00:01:08.509> it's<00:01:09.350> easy<00:01:09.619> to<00:01:09.830> realize

00:01:10.179 --> 00:01:10.189 
look back at them it's easy to realize

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:12.530 
and remember what wonderful stuff I've

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:15.840 
and remember what wonderful stuff I've
made<00:01:12.799> from<00:01:13.430> my<00:01:13.820> hand<00:01:14.060> spun<00:01:14.299> yarn

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:15.850 
made from my hand spun yarn

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:18.640 
made from my hand spun yarn
something<00:01:16.850> wonderful<00:01:17.330> about<00:01:17.390> fiber<00:01:17.900> is<00:01:18.229> that

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:18.650 
something wonderful about fiber is that

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:20.649 
something wonderful about fiber is that
from<00:01:18.979> any<00:01:19.250> batch<00:01:19.520> of<00:01:19.820> fiber<00:01:20.060> you<00:01:20.329> can<00:01:20.359> make<00:01:20.630> a

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:20.659 
from any batch of fiber you can make a

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:23.590 
from any batch of fiber you can make a
lot<00:01:20.929> of<00:01:20.960> different<00:01:21.439> yarns<00:01:21.859> you<00:01:22.270> sit<00:01:23.270> down<00:01:23.450> at

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:23.600 
lot of different yarns you sit down at

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.149 
lot of different yarns you sit down at
your<00:01:23.719> wheel<00:01:23.899> and<00:01:23.929> you<00:01:24.229> start<00:01:24.530> spinning<00:01:24.859> and

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:25.159 
your wheel and you start spinning and

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:27.399 
your wheel and you start spinning and
the<00:01:25.280> first<00:01:25.490> thing<00:01:25.670> you<00:01:25.820> make<00:01:25.999> well<00:01:26.329> it<00:01:26.869> is<00:01:27.109> what

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:27.409 
the first thing you make well it is what

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:30.609 
the first thing you make well it is what
it<00:01:27.530> is<00:01:27.710> spin<00:01:28.429> for<00:01:28.670> a<00:01:28.729> while<00:01:29.140> unwind<00:01:30.140> some<00:01:30.469> of

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:30.619 
it is spin for a while unwind some of

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:33.279 
it is spin for a while unwind some of
that<00:01:30.740> yarn<00:01:31.009> from<00:01:31.189> your<00:01:31.429> bobbin<00:01:32.020> take<00:01:33.020> a<00:01:33.049> look

00:01:33.279 --> 00:01:33.289 
that yarn from your bobbin take a look

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:35.499 
that yarn from your bobbin take a look
at<00:01:33.469> it<00:01:33.679> I<00:01:33.799> usually<00:01:33.920> unwind<00:01:34.729> it<00:01:34.880> like<00:01:35.030> this<00:01:35.270> and

00:01:35.499 --> 00:01:35.509 
at it I usually unwind it like this and

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:38.590 
at it I usually unwind it like this and
make<00:01:35.659> a<00:01:35.689> two-ply<00:01:36.200> sample<00:01:36.829> and<00:01:37.039> see<00:01:37.640> what<00:01:38.450> have

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600 
make a two-ply sample and see what have

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.050 
make a two-ply sample and see what have
I<00:01:38.689> been<00:01:38.899> doing<00:01:38.960> if<00:01:39.710> I<00:01:39.950> spin<00:01:40.310> this<00:01:40.520> way

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:41.060 
I been doing if I spin this way

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:43.630 
I been doing if I spin this way
what<00:01:41.210> kind<00:01:41.479> of<00:01:41.600> yarn<00:01:41.840> would<00:01:42.049> I<00:01:42.079> get<00:01:42.380> is<00:01:43.069> it<00:01:43.369> yarn

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:43.640 
what kind of yarn would I get is it yarn

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.999 
what kind of yarn would I get is it yarn
that<00:01:43.819> I<00:01:43.880> would<00:01:44.149> love<00:01:44.420> is<00:01:44.810> it<00:01:45.200> yarn<00:01:45.439> I'd<00:01:45.619> like<00:01:45.799> to

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:46.009 
that I would love is it yarn I'd like to

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:48.099 
that I would love is it yarn I'd like to
work<00:01:46.219> with<00:01:46.249> do<00:01:46.939> I<00:01:46.999> want<00:01:47.270> to<00:01:47.359> make<00:01:47.479> more<00:01:47.719> of<00:01:47.780> that

00:01:48.099 --> 00:01:48.109 
work with do I want to make more of that

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:50.950 
work with do I want to make more of that
but<00:01:48.770> wait<00:01:49.069> until<00:01:49.310> the<00:01:49.399> bobbins<00:01:49.850> full<00:01:50.179> as<00:01:50.630> soon

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:50.960 
but wait until the bobbins full as soon

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.599 
but wait until the bobbins full as soon
as<00:01:51.049> you've<00:01:51.170> got<00:01:51.200> a<00:01:51.380> little<00:01:51.799> bit<00:01:52.009> on<00:01:52.249> the<00:01:52.429> bobbin

00:01:52.599 --> 00:01:52.609 
as you've got a little bit on the bobbin

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:55.179 
as you've got a little bit on the bobbin
unwind<00:01:53.270> it<00:01:53.479> and<00:01:53.569> look<00:01:53.719> at<00:01:53.929> it<00:01:53.990> I'm<00:01:54.740> looking<00:01:54.889> at

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:55.189 
unwind it and look at it I'm looking at

00:01:55.189 --> 00:01:56.980 
unwind it and look at it I'm looking at
this<00:01:55.310> and<00:01:55.490> I'm<00:01:55.609> saying<00:01:55.850> all<00:01:56.179> well<00:01:56.719> and<00:01:56.929> good

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:56.990 
this and I'm saying all well and good

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:59.309 
this and I'm saying all well and good
it's<00:01:57.319> a<00:01:57.439> nice<00:01:57.590> piece<00:01:57.799> of<00:01:58.009> yarn<00:01:58.280> but<00:01:58.490> what<00:01:58.969> if

00:01:59.309 --> 00:01:59.319 
it's a nice piece of yarn but what if

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:02.289 
it's a nice piece of yarn but what if
what<00:02:00.319> if<00:02:00.350> I<00:02:00.619> spun<00:02:00.950> this<00:02:01.189> fiber<00:02:01.520> and<00:02:01.850> made<00:02:02.090> a

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:02.299 
what if I spun this fiber and made a

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:03.940 
what if I spun this fiber and made a
thicker<00:02:02.689> yarn<00:02:03.020> what<00:02:03.319> I<00:02:03.350> like<00:02:03.590> that<00:02:03.619> even

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:03.950 
thicker yarn what I like that even

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.710 
thicker yarn what I like that even
better<00:02:04.240> so<00:02:05.240> let<00:02:05.329> me<00:02:05.420> break<00:02:05.630> this<00:02:05.929> sample<00:02:06.380> off

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:07.720 
better so let me break this sample off

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:12.040 
better so let me break this sample off
keep<00:02:08.720> it<00:02:08.840> on<00:02:08.929> my<00:02:09.050> lap<00:02:09.940> joint<00:02:10.940> on<00:02:11.150> my<00:02:11.180> fiber<00:02:11.690> and

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
keep it on my lap joint on my fiber and

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:14.770 
keep it on my lap joint on my fiber and
with<00:02:12.830> this<00:02:13.040> same<00:02:13.340> fiber<00:02:13.790> now<00:02:14.090> I'm<00:02:14.360> going<00:02:14.660> to

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
with this same fiber now I'm going to

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.500 
with this same fiber now I'm going to
produce<00:02:14.959> a<00:02:15.319> thicker<00:02:15.650> singles<00:02:16.310> the<00:02:17.209> way<00:02:17.330> I<00:02:17.360> do

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
produce a thicker singles the way I do

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.010 
produce a thicker singles the way I do
that<00:02:17.870> is<00:02:18.170> by<00:02:18.850> pulling<00:02:19.850> more<00:02:20.209> fiber<00:02:20.569> into<00:02:20.930> the

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:21.020 
that is by pulling more fiber into the

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:23.589 
that is by pulling more fiber into the
yarn<00:02:21.290> more<00:02:22.100> fiber<00:02:22.430> makes<00:02:22.730> a<00:02:22.850> fatter<00:02:23.090> yarn

00:02:23.589 --> 00:02:23.599 
yarn more fiber makes a fatter yarn

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:28.570 
yarn more fiber makes a fatter yarn
duh<00:02:25.959> actually<00:02:26.959> although<00:02:27.080> it's<00:02:27.349> very<00:02:27.680> simple

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
duh actually although it's very simple

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:29.230 
duh actually although it's very simple
to<00:02:28.879> say

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:29.240 
to say

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:32.410 
to say
this<00:02:29.660> isn't<00:02:29.990> easy<00:02:30.440> to<00:02:30.830> do<00:02:30.980> but<00:02:31.700> with<00:02:31.880> practice

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
this isn't easy to do but with practice

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.750 
this isn't easy to do but with practice
you<00:02:32.930> can<00:02:32.960> make<00:02:33.380> a<00:02:33.560> yarn<00:02:33.890> that's<00:02:34.130> thicker<00:02:34.460> than

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
you can make a yarn that's thicker than

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.200 
you can make a yarn that's thicker than
you<00:02:34.880> usually<00:02:35.390> spin<00:02:36.280> do<00:02:37.280> that<00:02:37.460> for<00:02:37.700> a<00:02:37.730> while

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:38.210 
you usually spin do that for a while

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:41.370 
you usually spin do that for a while
maybe<00:02:39.050> I've<00:02:39.200> got<00:02:39.350> enough<00:02:39.680> break<00:02:40.460> it<00:02:40.610> off

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.380 
maybe I've got enough break it off

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:49.140 
maybe I've got enough break it off
unwind<00:02:46.630> again<00:02:47.630> I'll<00:02:47.750> double<00:02:48.350> back<00:02:48.380> on<00:02:48.770> myself

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
unwind again I'll double back on myself

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:55.890 
unwind again I'll double back on myself
itself<00:02:50.530> to<00:02:51.530> make<00:02:52.070> a<00:02:52.100> two-ply<00:02:52.790> sample<00:02:53.710> and<00:02:54.710> now

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
itself to make a two-ply sample and now

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.060 
itself to make a two-ply sample and now
mmm<00:02:56.900> that<00:02:57.200> was<00:02:57.320> harder<00:02:57.560> to<00:02:57.590> break<00:02:57.800> because

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:58.070 
mmm that was harder to break because

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:59.890 
mmm that was harder to break because
it's<00:02:58.370> thicker<00:02:58.610> more<00:02:59.180> fiber<00:02:59.450> makes<00:02:59.720> it

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
it's thicker more fiber makes it

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.700 
it's thicker more fiber makes it
stronger<00:03:00.550> well<00:03:01.600> and<00:03:02.600> I<00:03:02.660> hid<00:03:02.870> what<00:03:03.110> size<00:03:03.380> yarn

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:03.710 
stronger well and I hid what size yarn

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:06.010 
stronger well and I hid what size yarn
and<00:03:03.950> now<00:03:04.250> I've<00:03:04.580> got<00:03:04.820> a<00:03:04.850> bigger<00:03:05.180> yarn<00:03:05.480> who<00:03:05.750> Ola

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:06.020 
and now I've got a bigger yarn who Ola

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:07.870 
and now I've got a bigger yarn who Ola
thicker<00:03:06.350> yarn<00:03:06.620> I<00:03:06.890> kind<00:03:07.280> of<00:03:07.310> like<00:03:07.460> that<00:03:07.640> chubby

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:07.880 
thicker yarn I kind of like that chubby

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:16.480 
thicker yarn I kind of like that chubby
one

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:16.490 

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:18.550
