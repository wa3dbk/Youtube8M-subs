beginning that video that was a complete
brain<00:05:35.520> freeze<00:05:36.000> that's<00:05:36.270> one<00:05:36.420> of<00:05:36.510> those<00:05:36.600> dull

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:37.370 
brain freeze that's one of those dull

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:42.800 
brain freeze that's one of those dull
moments<00:05:38.370> on<00:05:40.430> what<00:05:41.430> happened<00:05:41.880> was<00:05:42.000> here's<00:05:42.360> the

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:42.810 
moments on what happened was here's the

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:45.500 
moments on what happened was here's the
best<00:05:43.020> way<00:05:43.140> I<00:05:43.170> can<00:05:43.230> explain<00:05:43.350> it<00:05:43.820> when<00:05:44.820> I<00:05:44.850> when<00:05:45.450> I

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:45.510 
best way I can explain it when I when I

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:47.480 
best way I can explain it when I when I
threw<00:05:45.720> the<00:05:45.810> ball<00:05:46.040> my<00:05:47.040> mind<00:05:47.250> I<00:05:47.340> was<00:05:47.460> thinking

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:47.490 
threw the ball my mind I was thinking

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:50.960 
threw the ball my mind I was thinking
pass<00:05:47.910> interference<00:05:48.380> when<00:05:49.380> he<00:05:49.680> intercepted<00:05:50.430> I

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:50.970 
pass interference when he intercepted I

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:53.270 
pass interference when he intercepted I
was<00:05:51.390> still<00:05:51.600> thinking<00:05:51.630> pass<00:05:52.050> interference<00:05:52.320> but

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:53.280 
was still thinking pass interference but

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:55.220 
was still thinking pass interference but
it<00:05:53.340> was<00:05:53.430> a<00:05:53.490> roughing<00:05:53.820> the<00:05:53.880> passer<00:05:54.180> call<00:05:54.450> which

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:55.230 
it was a roughing the passer call which

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:58.040 
it was a roughing the passer call which
means<00:05:55.590> that<00:05:55.910> penalty<00:05:56.910> would<00:05:57.600> have<00:05:57.750> been<00:05:57.870> back

00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:58.050 
means that penalty would have been back

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:01.070 
means that penalty would have been back
there<00:05:58.080> if<00:05:58.800> I<00:05:58.980> were<00:05:59.040> to<00:05:59.100> press<00:05:59.310> eight<00:05:59.580> I<00:06:00.080> don't

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:01.080 
there if I were to press eight I don't

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:03.290 
there if I were to press eight I don't
know<00:06:01.200> why<00:06:01.410> in<00:06:01.680> my<00:06:01.800> mind<00:06:02.160> I<00:06:02.490> was<00:06:02.730> thinking<00:06:02.760> pass

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:03.300 
know why in my mind I was thinking pass

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:04.880 
know why in my mind I was thinking pass
interference<00:06:03.600> because<00:06:04.260> of<00:06:04.530> his<00:06:04.650> pass

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:04.890 
interference because of his pass

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:06.230 
interference because of his pass
interference<00:06:05.160> I<00:06:05.580> thought<00:06:05.880> it<00:06:06.060> would<00:06:06.150> have

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:06.240 
interference I thought it would have

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:09.470 
interference I thought it would have
been<00:06:06.330> up<00:06:06.480> there<00:06:06.740> saw<00:06:07.740> press<00:06:08.010> X<00:06:08.220> it<00:06:08.820> was<00:06:08.970> a<00:06:09.000> it

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:09.480

outplayed<00:06:32.430> I<00:06:32.910> got<00:06:33.090> beat<00:06:33.650> mentally<00:06:34.650> and

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:34.770 
outplayed I got beat mentally and

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:38.060 
outplayed I got beat mentally and
physically<00:06:35.450> but<00:06:36.450> anyway<00:06:37.110> that<00:06:37.140> does<00:06:37.680> just<00:06:37.979> the

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:38.070 
physically but anyway that does just the

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:40.490 
physically but anyway that does just the
sum<00:06:38.490> up<00:06:38.640> that<00:06:38.700> game<00:06:39.120> play<00:06:39.419> could<00:06:40.380> I<00:06:40.410> have

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:40.500 
sum up that game play could I have

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:41.620 
sum up that game play could I have
stopped<00:06:40.919> the<00:06:41.070> Blitz

stopped the Blitz

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:43.750 
stopped the Blitz
no<00:06:41.870> maybe<00:06:42.620> I<00:06:42.740> could<00:06:43.010> probably<00:06:43.310> should've<00:06:43.700> did

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:43.760 
no maybe I could probably should've did

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:46.270 
no maybe I could probably should've did
more<00:06:44.000> shotguns<00:06:44.510> and<00:06:44.810> quick<00:06:45.110> passes<00:06:45.590> but

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:46.280 
more shotguns and quick passes but

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:47.560 
more shotguns and quick passes but
they're<00:06:46.430> probably<00:06:46.610> led<00:06:46.970> more<00:06:47.210> interceptions

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:47.570 
they're probably led more interceptions

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:51.670 
they're probably led more interceptions
so<00:06:48.440> I<00:06:48.770> don't<00:06:49.550> know<00:06:49.810> maybe<00:06:50.810> the<00:06:51.050> next<00:06:51.170> time<00:06:51.350> if
