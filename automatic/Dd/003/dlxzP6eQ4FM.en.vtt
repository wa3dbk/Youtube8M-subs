00:00:05.519 --> 00:00:05.529 
while the air boss has been a very

00:00:05.529 --> 00:00:08.370 
while the air boss has been a very
successful<00:00:06.190> product<00:00:06.700> for<00:00:06.970> us<00:00:07.000> we<00:00:07.450> as<00:00:07.810> it<00:00:08.170> grew

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:08.380 
successful product for us we as it grew

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:09.959 
successful product for us we as it grew
we<00:00:08.650> started<00:00:09.010> getting<00:00:09.130> some<00:00:09.400> of<00:00:09.490> them<00:00:09.610> returned

00:00:09.959 --> 00:00:09.969 
we started getting some of them returned

00:00:09.969 --> 00:00:11.910 
we started getting some of them returned
and<00:00:10.240> we<00:00:10.299> found<00:00:10.480> that<00:00:10.629> women<00:00:10.990> were<00:00:11.559> returning

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:11.920 
and we found that women were returning

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:14.340 
and we found that women were returning
them<00:00:12.160> and<00:00:12.400> the<00:00:13.299> reason<00:00:13.600> for<00:00:13.629> that<00:00:13.809> was<00:00:14.080> is<00:00:14.320> that

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:14.350 
them and the reason for that was is that

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:15.539 
them and the reason for that was is that
carrying<00:00:15.010> the<00:00:15.100> bag

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:15.549

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:17.850 
carrying the bag
fully<00:00:15.879> loaded<00:00:16.090> on<00:00:16.330> one<00:00:16.570> shoulder<00:00:16.810> was<00:00:17.590> getting

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:17.860 
fully loaded on one shoulder was getting

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:20.820 
fully loaded on one shoulder was getting
to<00:00:17.949> be<00:00:18.100> too<00:00:18.670> much<00:00:18.789> of<00:00:18.850> a<00:00:19.000> load<00:00:19.180> and<00:00:19.750> so<00:00:20.349> early

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:20.830 
to be too much of a load and so early

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:22.499 
to be too much of a load and so early
attempts<00:00:21.160> at<00:00:21.279> bastardizing<00:00:21.849> the<00:00:22.119> air<00:00:22.269> boss

00:00:22.499 --> 00:00:22.509 
attempts at bastardizing the air boss

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:24.630 
attempts at bastardizing the air boss
putting<00:00:23.169> backpack<00:00:23.589> straps<00:00:23.949> on<00:00:24.160> it<00:00:24.189> were<00:00:24.519> an

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:24.640 
putting backpack straps on it were an

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.089 
putting backpack straps on it were an
utter<00:00:24.759> failure<00:00:25.259> so<00:00:26.259> we<00:00:26.470> went<00:00:26.650> back<00:00:26.710> to<00:00:27.009> the

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:27.099 
utter failure so we went back to the

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:29.070 
utter failure so we went back to the
drawing<00:00:27.279> board<00:00:27.449> consulted<00:00:28.449> Doug<00:00:28.599> DeMint<00:00:28.929> from

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:30.720 
drawing board consulted Doug DeMint from
one<00:00:29.230> bag<00:00:29.410> again<00:00:29.769> and<00:00:29.980> out<00:00:30.490> of<00:00:30.640> that

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:30.730

collaboration<00:00:31.449> the<00:00:32.169> SkyTrain<00:00:32.439> was<00:00:32.800> born<00:00:33.010> the

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:33.760 
collaboration the SkyTrain was born the

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:35.580 
collaboration the SkyTrain was born the
design<00:00:34.120> of<00:00:34.270> the<00:00:34.329> SkyTrain<00:00:34.570> this<00:00:34.960> is<00:00:35.140> actually

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:35.590 
design of the SkyTrain this is actually

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:37.920 
design of the SkyTrain this is actually
a<00:00:35.620> complete<00:00:36.070> departure<00:00:36.219> from<00:00:36.690> from<00:00:37.690> the<00:00:37.809> air

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:37.930 
a complete departure from from the air

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:40.799 
a complete departure from from the air
boss<00:00:38.160> whereas<00:00:39.160> the<00:00:39.370> the<00:00:39.850> air<00:00:40.059> boss<00:00:40.239> opens<00:00:40.660> like

00:00:40.799 --> 00:00:40.809 
boss whereas the the air boss opens like

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:42.720 
boss whereas the the air boss opens like
a<00:00:40.840> book<00:00:41.199> the<00:00:41.680> SkyTrain<00:00:41.890> opens<00:00:42.399> more<00:00:42.550> like<00:00:42.699> a

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:42.730 
a book the SkyTrain opens more like a

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:46.680 
a book the SkyTrain opens more like a
backpack<00:00:43.270> and<00:00:43.800> so<00:00:44.800> that<00:00:45.370> limited<00:00:46.270> us<00:00:46.390> to<00:00:46.570> doing

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:46.690 
backpack and so that limited us to doing

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:48.180 
backpack and so that limited us to doing
some<00:00:46.930> certain<00:00:47.199> things<00:00:47.410> and<00:00:47.620> so<00:00:47.739> it<00:00:47.859> ends<00:00:48.100> up

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:48.190 
some certain things and so it ends up

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:49.799 
some certain things and so it ends up
with<00:00:48.370> two<00:00:48.609> compartments<00:00:48.940> instead<00:00:49.420> of<00:00:49.510> three

00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:49.809 
with two compartments instead of three

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:52.770 
with two compartments instead of three
the<00:00:50.410> main<00:00:50.710> large<00:00:51.160> compartment<00:00:51.789> holds<00:00:52.420> just<00:00:52.600> as

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:52.780 
the main large compartment holds just as

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:54.119 
the main large compartment holds just as
much<00:00:52.960> as<00:00:53.109> the<00:00:53.199> air<00:00:53.320> boss<00:00:53.530> does<00:00:53.769> while<00:00:53.980> that

00:00:54.119 --> 00:00:54.129 
much as the air boss does while that

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:55.709 
much as the air boss does while that
outer<00:00:54.340> compartment<00:00:54.579> is<00:00:55.030> perfect<00:00:55.449> for<00:00:55.570> like<00:00:55.690> a

00:00:55.709 --> 00:00:55.719 
outer compartment is perfect for like a

00:00:55.719 --> 00:00:57.900 
outer compartment is perfect for like a
rain<00:00:56.019> slicker<00:00:56.350> and<00:00:56.710> some<00:00:57.309> lightweight<00:00:57.489> gear

00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:57.910 
rain slicker and some lightweight gear

rain slicker and some lightweight gear
the<00:00:58.300> SkyTrain<00:00:58.539> was<00:00:58.870> developed<00:00:59.289> for

00:00:59.430 --> 00:00:59.440 
the SkyTrain was developed for

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:00.750 
the SkyTrain was developed for
transitioning<00:01:00.010> from<00:01:00.070> the<00:01:00.219> airplane<00:01:00.519> to<00:01:00.730> the

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:00.760 
transitioning from the airplane to the

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.209 
transitioning from the airplane to the
train<00:01:01.170> particularly<00:01:02.170> in<00:01:02.289> Europe<00:01:02.589> due<00:01:03.010> to<00:01:03.039> the

00:01:03.209 --> 00:01:03.219 
train particularly in Europe due to the

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:05.040 
train particularly in Europe due to the
backpack<00:01:03.609> nature<00:01:04.059> design<00:01:04.360> of<00:01:04.480> the<00:01:04.570> sky<00:01:04.780> train

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:05.050 
backpack nature design of the sky train

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:06.720 
backpack nature design of the sky train
we<00:01:05.500> had<00:01:05.650> to<00:01:05.770> limit<00:01:05.920> it<00:01:06.100> to<00:01:06.130> two<00:01:06.370> compartments

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:06.730 
we had to limit it to two compartments

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:08.640 
we had to limit it to two compartments
so<00:01:07.300> we<00:01:07.390> have<00:01:07.540> a<00:01:07.570> main<00:01:07.900> compartment<00:01:08.470> in<00:01:08.560> a

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:08.650 
so we have a main compartment in a

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:10.680 
so we have a main compartment in a
secondary<00:01:09.160> compartment<00:01:09.760> that<00:01:09.940> our<00:01:10.090> cargo

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:10.690 
secondary compartment that our cargo

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:12.180 
secondary compartment that our cargo
capacity<00:01:10.840> and<00:01:11.410> we<00:01:11.470> actually<00:01:11.950> have<00:01:12.070> another

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:12.190 
capacity and we actually have another

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:13.680 
capacity and we actually have another
compartment<00:01:12.850> here<00:01:12.970> on<00:01:13.090> the<00:01:13.150> outside<00:01:13.420> it's<00:01:13.630> a

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:13.690 
compartment here on the outside it's a

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:16.380 
compartment here on the outside it's a
flat<00:01:14.050> storage<00:01:14.820> in<00:01:15.820> the<00:01:15.940> main<00:01:16.090> compartment

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:16.390 
flat storage in the main compartment

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:20.010 
flat storage in the main compartment
which<00:01:17.050> opens<00:01:17.410> a<00:01:17.470> bit<00:01:17.650> differently<00:01:18.040> than<00:01:19.020> one

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:20.020 
which opens a bit differently than one

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.650 
which opens a bit differently than one
might<00:01:20.200> imagine<00:01:20.310> it<00:01:21.310> actually<00:01:21.580> pulls<00:01:21.940> open<00:01:22.270> and

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:22.660 
might imagine it actually pulls open and

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:26.550 
might imagine it actually pulls open and
opens<00:01:23.020> this<00:01:23.470> way<00:01:24.810> you<00:01:25.810> can<00:01:25.990> still<00:01:26.230> get<00:01:26.380> nice

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:26.560 
opens this way you can still get nice

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.410 
opens this way you can still get nice
clothes<00:01:26.890> in<00:01:27.040> here<00:01:27.190> a<00:01:27.340> sport<00:01:27.730> coat<00:01:27.940> dress
