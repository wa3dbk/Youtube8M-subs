00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:11.509
 Let's go. A straight line passing through the intersection of two straight lines. Here, only one is what to do. 

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:15.950
 One of the points even you will be easily solved if Hold it bet it 's such a no 

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:19.460
 The straight line a Kusasu day was swollen c call Mr. 0 and Eilat shake Sasubida was in 

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:22.030
 Seeda c This is the equation of the straight line passing through the intersection point of this zero 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:27.310
 There is a problem like 

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:30.430
 Straight line Lexus, for example, sounds that say this is a turnaround in -1502 f Seguwaifu often this zero 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:36.190
 The straight line equation taking point 45 has such a problem 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:40.600
 And this is determined by the coordinate coalition of the intersection point of the spear how to do Once this and the Kore of up to traditional junior high school students 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:42.020
 So there is such a way of finding a straight line equation at that point and this point, of course 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:47.620
 Still good I'm burned 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:52.300
 Let's keep in mind here the way we can do it faster than the high school way 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:54.250
 What I say is that it sometimes comes out in the center exam, I feel like this by all means in form 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:01:01.260
 Please keep pressing the shoulder which is in here 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:01:07.480
 In the equation of the straight line passing through the linearly this and this intersection to say the most pressing in 7 and in this case 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:12.760
 It can be expressed by this + plan here = 0 

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:17.410
 When kneaded for example a straight line which is referred to as and factory line b and a 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:23.080
 And the command of b on this a formula many auctions = 0 

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:27.430
 It is all right if you hold it down so much that it can be expressed in this form 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:32.560
 I wonder why I was wondering why something was happening now but for now 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:32.750
 Solve the problem specifically with the mind in mind that you should hold it down 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.310
 I will 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:40.009
 Let's find out what kind of thing it is after checking the way 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:44.000
 First we will check the way 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:44.840
 Ekushi addition to the straight line a 9 stars were -1 Goruzero the moving Korezo of 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.590
 Good turn 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:55.340
 I think when I see this to find a straight-line equation that takes point 45 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:59.909
 This and the improvement of this and the store This is the point of the head straight line, and the point of this and this and this when it sees here 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:02.730
 I remember this tip heavy when I saw a vision, but in straight lines this and the process of this 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:07.890
 Te equation of a straight line passing through the 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:14.970
 I think that it can not be expressed in the form of a + bracket guard = 0 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:18.030
 So the equation of the straight line to be determined is this + this of auction = 0 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:22.650
 It can be expressed as 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:23.280
 If you say what you want to do from here, you will go through the unoccupied 45 people 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:27.870
 because there is 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:32.940
 Because there I through the 1045's say x = 4 coating = child 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:38.050
 You're substituting in this equation and the continue to calculate the value of the management comes out 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:39.830
 The Tteyuu this system = 4 after If you wait too long and out the value of the Do I'm genealogy topic comes out management 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:45.440
 After substituting here 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:46.160
 The other rest is this a'll answer comes out to seek only unravel the calculation is the way is ok 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:51.860
 Or 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:55.170
 If it is said that a straight line passing through the intersection of this and this is like a + security like this 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:59.659
 Can be expressed in this way 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:05.540
 Let's holding that the Tteyuu can be solved south music if so 

00:02:59.659 --> 00:03:06.560
 Also it a little bit to understand Nde forget after rote memorization This immediately it is on down the way to do too much in 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:11.510
 Let's leave it 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:16.750
 In order to understand here , I want you to review the previous video by all means 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:22.090
 It was a straight line passing through the body point if it was in the last time 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:25.750
 Lexus rear had Tashi number meter-looking Ada check sustain Bida'a handiwork c soup voice even a little while ago 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:32.830
 If you write like a form a + kb = 0 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:34.630
 always holds x and also a brother is any value and I mean Kore Tsu what is understood When you have to q-shaped 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:36.770
 You know the value of y 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:39.690
 If you do not know what you are saying 

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:44.340
 Please review and watch the last video 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:48.420
 I This equation was I always value of holds x and y is found 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:52.860
 Individual part = ze a win here of part = 0 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:57.040
 Always holds even Nanbo is always stand type of value by solving the 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:04:00.280
 I just got to know the values ​​of x and y 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:08.079
 What are you doing this time but it's the opposite 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:12.340
 Find a straight line in the name of this time , and find the equation of the straight line passing through the point of intersection 

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:15.010
 Or difficult to do may be full Masu it difficult Shi ordeal be like this I may may date difficult in a straight line passing through the 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:17.030
 Ordeal Shi it's there a lot was to might be difficult 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:17.820
 There is a lot but 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:19.359
 I will 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:23.770
 inside that 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:29.720
 For example, the equation of a straight line passing through the 1045 and say this problem is that Tteyuu How do I know the 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:35.810
 Hey such Fu in I'm a lot there that went straight line passing through the simple point of intersection I 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:38.930
 In what kind of good weather we say, any straight line is established, that is, it always holds x 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:46.009
 Is such that the value of y to say this store is the 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:50.660
 So, conversely, the straight line passing through these two intersections can be expressed by this formula 

00:04:46.009 --> 00:04:54.650
 And I think expressed tilted other that say you are what is the represents the Tteyuu this cable 

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:58.529
 The bought Please I like this What if difficult to do or difficult 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:05:03.359
 It's determined by the guy to say what kind of inclination or 

00:04:58.529 --> 00:05:07.259
 So a straight line passing through the intersection of two straight lines can be expressed as follows and it is difficult to say this case 

00:05:03.359 --> 00:05:08.819
 Kana these do Kana such you do and Do represents the kind you kana of Tteyuu that way 

00:05:07.259 --> 00:05:15.149
 It is easy if you think 

00:05:08.819 --> 00:05:17.580
 Spear idea to master So here is always a straight line passing through the last of the bottom point at the bottom and set 

00:05:15.149 --> 00:05:22.169
 I think it is easy 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:25.680
 And I said before , but the most important thing is this way 

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:31.860
 We were told continued war this and the straight line of the equation passing through this intersection point to 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:36.479
 This This + through the store this Japanese people is the frequency you are not using and when in the form of this = 0 auction 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:37.510
 This time assignment Once when the system comes out because Once you have assigned it to his brother's here 

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:41.440
 Asked after an expression 

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:47.040
 It is important to master this flow when the equation of the first straight line comes out 

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:47.040
 After that, let's find a strike and practice it yourself so that it can be used as a hint already
