it<00:01:49.540> is<00:01:49.690> a<00:01:49.900> necessary<00:01:50.200> evil

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:51.190 
it is a necessary evil

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:55.080

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:27.310 
this actually made me feel bad for

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:29.879 
this actually made me feel bad for
Neville<00:05:27.520> was<00:05:28.300> that<00:05:28.479> he<00:05:28.750> first<00:05:29.139> split<00:05:29.439> second

Neville was that he first split second
he<00:05:29.919> got<00:05:30.189> happy<00:05:30.550> because<00:05:31.000> he<00:05:31.689> thought<00:05:31.990> that<00:05:32.289> his

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:32.710 
he got happy because he thought that his

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:35.100 
he got happy because he thought that his
older<00:05:33.039> brother<00:05:33.219> might<00:05:33.460> be<00:05:33.490> alive<00:05:33.849> he<00:05:34.419> looked

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:35.110 
older brother might be alive he looked

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:36.480 
older brother might be alive he looked
up<00:05:35.259> to<00:05:35.409> his<00:05:35.529> older<00:05:35.740> brother<00:05:35.770> he<00:05:36.129> loved<00:05:36.339> his

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:36.490 
up to his older brother he loved his

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:39.180 
up to his older brother he loved his
brother<00:05:36.669> and<00:05:37.589> he<00:05:38.589> thought<00:05:38.740> his<00:05:38.919> only<00:05:39.099> brother

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:39.190 
brother and he thought his only brother

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:41.189 
brother and he thought his only brother
might<00:05:39.490> be<00:05:39.520> alive<00:05:39.940> so<00:05:40.240> when<00:05:40.360> he<00:05:40.479> got<00:05:40.599> to<00:05:40.750> zero<00:05:41.020> he

00:05:41.189 --> 00:05:41.199 
might be alive so when he got to zero he

00:05:41.199 --> 00:05:42.659 
might be alive so when he got to zero he
was<00:05:41.319> actually<00:05:41.650> hoping<00:05:41.800> that<00:05:42.190> his<00:05:42.460> brother

00:05:42.659 --> 00:05:42.669 
was actually hoping that his brother

00:05:42.669 --> 00:05:44.579 
was actually hoping that his brother
would<00:05:42.819> be<00:05:42.879> there<00:05:43.210> but<00:05:43.779> then<00:05:43.930> he<00:05:44.080> came<00:05:44.289> to<00:05:44.349> the

00:05:44.579 --> 00:05:44.589 
would be there but then he came to the

00:05:44.589 --> 00:05:46.800 
would be there but then he came to the
real<00:05:44.800> sad<00:05:45.039> realization<00:05:45.419> that<00:05:46.419> they<00:05:46.629> don't

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:46.810 
real sad realization that they don't

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:49.350 
real sad realization that they don't
keep<00:05:47.020> normal<00:05:47.500> cock<00:05:47.680> soldiers<00:05:48.279> people<00:05:49.000> like

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:49.360 
keep normal cock soldiers people like

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:51.749 
keep normal cock soldiers people like
that<00:05:49.509> aren't<00:05:49.810> worthy<00:05:50.080> in<00:05:50.379> their<00:05:50.560> eyes<00:05:50.710> so<00:05:51.580> he

00:05:51.749 --> 00:05:51.759 
that aren't worthy in their eyes so he

00:05:51.759 --> 00:05:53.519 
that aren't worthy in their eyes so he
got<00:05:51.940> happy<00:05:52.300> that<00:05:52.810> he<00:05:52.900> might<00:05:53.080> see<00:05:53.229> his<00:05:53.259> brother

00:05:53.519 --> 00:05:53.529 
got happy that he might see his brother

00:05:53.529 --> 00:05:55.890 
got happy that he might see his brother
but<00:05:54.129> it<00:05:54.250> was<00:05:54.310> just<00:05:54.550> a<00:05:54.639> false<00:05:54.849> hope<00:05:55.029> and<00:05:55.360> he<00:05:55.690> got

00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:55.900 
but it was just a false hope and he got

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:57.510 
but it was just a false hope and he got
there<00:05:56.169> and<00:05:56.289> realize<00:05:56.620> I<00:05:56.800> realized<00:05:57.279> that<00:05:57.400> his
