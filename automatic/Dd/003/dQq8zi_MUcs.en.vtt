00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:22.040 
disappoint all right but the case was

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.609 
disappoint all right but the case was
clearly<00:01:22.580> defined<00:01:22.970> before<00:01:23.210> now<00:01:23.990> it's<00:01:24.290> just<00:01:24.440> a

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:24.619 
clearly defined before now it's just a

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:26.290 
clearly defined before now it's just a

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:51.420 
a pinprick but there is an indication
that<00:05:49.030> has<00:05:49.240> shifted<00:05:50.130> probably<00:05:51.130> from<00:05:51.310> the

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:51.430 
that has shifted probably from the

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:53.159 
that has shifted probably from the
collision<00:05:51.639> that<00:05:51.940> you<00:05:52.090> were<00:05:52.210> involving<00:05:52.600> and

00:05:53.159 --> 00:05:53.169 
collision that you were involving and

00:05:53.169 --> 00:05:56.939 
collision that you were involving and
the<00:05:53.320> shift<00:05:53.530> is<00:05:53.860> what<00:05:54.280> caused<00:05:54.520> your<00:05:54.699> seizure<00:05:55.949> so

00:05:56.939 --> 00:05:56.949 
the shift is what caused your seizure so

00:05:56.949 --> 00:06:00.150 
the shift is what caused your seizure so
is<00:05:57.160> it<00:05:57.310> was<00:05:57.460> a<00:05:57.520> one-time<00:05:57.880> thing<00:05:57.910> right<00:05:59.160> no

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:00.160 
is it was a one-time thing right no

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:02.370 
is it was a one-time thing right no
they're<00:06:00.759> gonna<00:06:00.910> occur<00:06:01.210> again<00:06:01.479> and<00:06:01.509> they<00:06:02.199> will

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:02.380 
they're gonna occur again and they will

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:03.570 
they're gonna occur again and they will
intense<00:06:02.740> can't<00:06:02.949> you<00:06:03.009> give<00:06:03.160> you<00:06:03.220> something<00:06:03.550> to

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:03.580 
intense can't you give you something to

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:06.600 
intense can't you give you something to
stop<00:06:03.850> them<00:06:04.090> in<00:06:04.509> this<00:06:05.199> particular<00:06:05.800> situation

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:06.610
