00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
the racket a little bit too soon

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.269 
the racket a little bit too soon
same<00:00:20.189> problem<00:00:20.670> that<00:00:20.699> Lucien<00:00:21.330> and<00:00:21.510> John<00:00:22.140> had<00:00:22.470> he

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
same problem that Lucien and John had he

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.790 
same problem that Lucien and John had he

does pivot and turn the shoulders fine

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.939

otherwise<00:00:26.490> so<00:00:27.029> this<00:00:27.390> looks<00:00:27.630> good<00:00:27.810> as<00:00:28.080> he

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
otherwise so this looks good as he

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.830 
otherwise so this looks good as he
brings<00:00:29.130> the<00:00:29.310> racket<00:00:29.699> back<00:00:29.730> you'll<00:00:30.630> notice

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
that and this C is going to facilitate a

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.619 
that and this C is going to facilitate a
continuous<00:00:40.710> swing<00:00:40.980> path<00:00:41.250> so<00:00:41.910> Kevin

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
continuous swing path so Kevin

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.950 
continuous swing path so Kevin
unlike<00:00:43.379> Lucien<00:00:44.219> and<00:00:44.399> John<00:00:44.670> has<00:00:45.239> that<00:00:45.629> fifth

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
nice job of loading up on his outside

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.819 
nice job of loading up on his outside
leg<00:00:50.910> he's<00:00:51.090> got<00:00:51.239> the<00:00:51.390> weight<00:00:51.570> there<00:00:51.899> but<00:00:52.710> his

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
leg he's got the weight there but his

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.979 
leg he's got the weight there but his
non<00:00:53.039> hitting<00:00:53.520> arm<00:00:53.730> is<00:00:54.270> pointed<00:00:54.719> into<00:00:54.899> the

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
non hitting arm is pointed into the

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.500 
non hitting arm is pointed into the
court<00:00:55.320> same<00:00:55.739> problem<00:00:56.219> is<00:00:56.370> Lucien<00:00:56.789> and<00:00:57.000> John

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
court same problem is Lucien and John

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.630 
court same problem is Lucien and John
doesn't<00:00:58.230> extend<00:00:58.710> it<00:00:58.829> out<00:00:58.949> across<00:00:59.280> his<00:00:59.520> body

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
doesn't extend it out across his body

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.260 
doesn't extend it out across his body
like<00:00:59.969> he<00:01:00.090> should<00:01:00.359> when<00:01:01.350> he<00:01:01.469> swings<00:01:02.120> well<00:01:03.120> he

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
like he should when he swings well he

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.929 
like he should when he swings well he
doesn't<00:01:03.690> actually<00:01:03.899> push<00:01:04.439> off<00:01:04.680> his<00:01:05.309> outside

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
doesn't actually push off his outside

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.429 
doesn't actually push off his outside
leg<00:01:06.299> you'll<00:01:06.630> notice<00:01:06.960> that<00:01:07.080> the<00:01:07.200> weight

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
leg you'll notice that the weight

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.010 
leg you'll notice that the weight
actually<00:01:08.070> centers<00:01:08.820> over<00:01:09.000> both<00:01:09.360> feet<00:01:09.780> and<00:01:09.960> then

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
actually centers over both feet and then

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.920 
actually centers over both feet and then
he<00:01:10.409> pushes<00:01:10.799> off<00:01:10.920> both<00:01:11.220> legs<00:01:11.580> as<00:01:11.790> he<00:01:11.939> swings<00:01:12.270> so

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
he pushes off both legs as he swings so

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.520 
he pushes off both legs as he swings so
that's<00:01:13.110> a<00:01:13.229> bit<00:01:13.350> of<00:01:13.439> a<00:01:13.560> mistake<00:01:13.740> and<00:01:14.960> he<00:01:15.960> rotates

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
that's a bit of a mistake and he rotates

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.770 
that's a bit of a mistake and he rotates
back<00:01:17.220> towards<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:17.759> court<00:01:18.000> to<00:01:18.390> get<00:01:18.479> his<00:01:18.630> body

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
back towards the court to get his body

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.539 
back towards the court to get his body
facing<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:19.380> net<00:01:19.560> but<00:01:19.740> he's<00:01:19.890> a<00:01:19.920> little<00:01:20.100> jammed

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
facing the net but he's a little jammed

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.580 
facing the net but he's a little jammed
on<00:01:20.729> this<00:01:20.880> forehand<00:01:21.270> he's<00:01:21.390> not<00:01:21.540> fully<00:01:21.869> rotated

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
on this forehand he's not fully rotated

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.590 
on this forehand he's not fully rotated
but<00:01:23.400> if<00:01:23.490> we<00:01:23.610> look<00:01:23.759> at<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:24.000> swing<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.450> racket

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
but if we look at the swing the racket

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.630 
but if we look at the swing the racket
does<00:01:25.080> drop<00:01:25.409> down<00:01:25.680> and<00:01:25.890> swing<00:01:26.130> forward<00:01:26.460> like<00:01:26.610> we

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
does drop down and swing forward like we

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.640 
does drop down and swing forward like we
talked<00:01:27.000> about<00:01:27.119> before<00:01:27.420> so<00:01:27.900> the<00:01:28.110> swing<00:01:28.409> the

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
talked about before so the swing the

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.890 
talked about before so the swing the
path<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:29.460> racket<00:01:29.880> is<00:01:29.970> traveling<00:01:30.450> along<00:01:30.540> is

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
path the racket is traveling along is

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.980 
path the racket is traveling along is
correct<00:01:31.759> because<00:01:32.759> he's<00:01:33.150> a<00:01:33.180> little<00:01:33.390> jammed<00:01:33.750> at

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
correct because he's a little jammed at

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.590 
correct because he's a little jammed at
his<00:01:34.140> contact<00:01:34.650> point<00:01:35.119> follow-through<00:01:36.119> it's

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
his contact point follow-through it's

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.450 
his contact point follow-through it's
gonna<00:01:36.720> be<00:01:36.900> a<00:01:36.930> little<00:01:37.110> bit<00:01:37.320> awkward<00:01:37.500> doesn't

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
gonna be a little bit awkward doesn't

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.760 
gonna be a little bit awkward doesn't
extend<00:01:38.729> out<00:01:38.939> in<00:01:39.060> the<00:01:39.150> court<00:01:39.420> as<00:01:39.570> much<00:01:40.020> as<00:01:40.439> much

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
extend out in the court as much as much

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.249 
extend out in the court as much as much
as<00:01:40.799> he<00:01:41.070> would<00:01:41.159> like<00:01:41.220> and<00:01:41.670> he<00:01:42.119> doesn't<00:01:42.570> turn<00:01:42.960> his

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
as he would like and he doesn't turn his

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.260 
as he would like and he doesn't turn his

amateur

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:44.450 
amateur
me<00:05:42.780> because<00:05:43.440> we<00:05:43.560> haven't<00:05:43.740> seen<00:05:43.919> an<00:05:44.039> amateur

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:44.460 
me because we haven't seen an amateur

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:46.339 
me because we haven't seen an amateur
yet<00:05:44.669> who<00:05:44.969> has<00:05:45.090> all<00:05:45.300> five<00:05:45.599> fundamentals<00:05:46.199> and

00:05:46.339 --> 00:05:46.349 
yet who has all five fundamentals and

00:05:46.349 --> 00:05:47.930 
yet who has all five fundamentals and
does<00:05:46.800> them<00:05:47.009> every<00:05:47.219> single<00:05:47.370> time<00:05:47.669> they<00:05:47.789> hit<00:05:47.880> a

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:47.940 
does them every single time they hit a

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:50.480 
does them every single time they hit a
forehand<00:05:48.210> and<00:05:48.840> this<00:05:49.440> is<00:05:49.590> what<00:05:49.800> that<00:05:50.069> looks

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:50.490 
forehand and this is what that looks

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:51.980 
forehand and this is what that looks
like<00:05:50.699> this<00:05:50.880> is<00:05:51.029> me<00:05:51.180> just<00:05:51.389> hitting<00:05:51.630> four<00:05:51.810> hands

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:51.990 
like this is me just hitting four hands

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:54.200 
like this is me just hitting four hands
on<00:05:52.139> a<00:05:52.169> ball<00:05:52.409> machine<00:05:52.560> and<00:05:53.159> you<00:05:53.759> can<00:05:53.880> see<00:05:54.029> this

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:54.210 
on a ball machine and you can see this

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:55.490 
on a ball machine and you can see this
looks<00:05:54.389> like<00:05:54.509> a<00:05:54.569> fundamentally<00:05:55.319> sound

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:55.500 
looks like a fundamentally sound

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:57.769 
looks like a fundamentally sound
forehand<00:05:56.039> well<00:05:56.909> if<00:05:57.029> you<00:05:57.120> remember<00:05:57.539> back<00:05:57.719> to

00:05:57.769 --> 00:05:57.779 
forehand well if you remember back to

forehand well if you remember back to
the<00:05:57.930> beginning<00:05:58.050> of<00:05:58.500> this<00:05:58.650> email<00:05:59.069> course<00:05:59.400> I

00:05:59.719 --> 00:05:59.729 
the beginning of this email course I

00:05:59.729 --> 00:06:01.399 
the beginning of this email course I
said<00:05:59.940> that<00:06:00.240> what<00:06:00.360> separates<00:06:00.659> amateur<00:06:01.199> from

00:06:01.399 --> 00:06:01.409 
said that what separates amateur from

00:06:01.409 --> 00:06:04.010 
said that what separates amateur from
professionals<00:06:02.009> is<00:06:02.190> the<00:06:02.759> fundamentals<00:06:03.330> well

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:04.020 
professionals is the fundamentals well

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:05.570 
professionals is the fundamentals well
if<00:06:04.139> I<00:06:04.259> have<00:06:04.349> a<00:06:04.409> fundamentally<00:06:04.889> sound<00:06:04.949> forehand

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:05.580 
if I have a fundamentally sound forehand

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:07.459
