00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:10.230
 Yes Well It is the fourth number of column four corners No. 2 

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:14.160
 I am crying 3721 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:17.250
 How about this feature here 4 here is ion 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:21.300
 I on here is Japan here to enter 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:23.620
 All numbers are equal so this sequence 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.270
 Voyeur 

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:30.640
 toy 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:34.989
 It is a study of information about this voyeur column I 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:40.020
 And here is the first number This is the second 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:43.680
 3rd number 4th number 5th wall 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:47.250
 Now say stop the 25th number 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.950
 I do not buy it because it is the 25th number 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.380
 20 pieces of Marl 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:58.130
 Let's think about regularity a little 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:01:00.610
 At last, the first number is the second number, but this is a large number of issues 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:05.920
 4 or something 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:10.330
 Well then the third cars this is 13 but this is ice 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:13.890
 4 stands 4 It is 2 here 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:19.710
 So the number of the next 4 th 17 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:26.520
 55 + 4 It's a lot of 4 sohyeon 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:29.850
 And if it is like this , I will omit the shawl, so what about the 25th number? 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:33.630
 Do you say and What I do Mase Kawakari of 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:39.580
 Put out Gota one chosen Soo 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:40.760
 It is supposed to be in the shape of Tenten Ten + 4 This is from this little writing 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:45.510
 Right ? 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:47.550
 I think this is the 5 majority 4 relationship 0 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:51.090
 It is one that can write 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:52.550
 Then there are many 4 countries 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.780
 It is to 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:57.790
 Well then this is a lot of issues 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:01.400
 4 It is Kakenu's 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:03.950
 Well then this is the issue number 4 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:09.800
 Yes what will be 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:17.870
 If you check the regularity, it is 0 if it is the first number 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:20.240
 But the second number and the 13th number etc. here's that it is the fourth of the number here to 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:26.440
 I think you have one smaller 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:26.440
 Well then if it is the 25th furniture, here is 24 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:33.980
 Then I will study high school and this is 96 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:41.240
 Because it'll be plus or nice issue to it 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:42.290
 To this + + 100 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:43.290
 Do you Fukunoki opening 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:46.130
 5 + and 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:53.350
 It is Rakuichi 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:53.350
 It's good, so I think this 101 is 101 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:59.230
 In this case , let's remember it like this 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:10.370
 When all four are the first many 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:10.370
 One less than this order number 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:23.319
 Calculate this Calculate this 24 Calculate this 96 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:27.510
 The Yes and Tashi issue and I wish you 101 came out the answer is here 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:32.120
 Let's to be able to quickly to like this 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:35.540
 And say that the next is asking for up to 25 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:38.890
 I understand that here is 101 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:40.580
 Well then this is the ball 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:44.010
 A little bit of goods 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:47.580
 Let's stop it 1317 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:51.700
 In so Ten doing Den 101 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:53.130
 In the case of 101 This Juju 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:54.470
 7 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:56.840
 Sounds good 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:04:00.050
 If you choose and learn 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:01.060
 Then write this in reverse go 

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:03.590
 Noon 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:07.960
 Good 13 good shoes 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:13.610
 Then this is 97 and this is 101 

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:14.800
 So this is 93, this is 89 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:17.850
 Sounds good 

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:21.329
 If you open that way 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:23.540
 It is normal until later 101 

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:26.050
 It is why two there 

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:30.980
 In this two 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:33.620
 And I'll plus top and bottom and I'll be 106 Koreta 106 

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:36.320
 Even this 106 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:39.080
 Even this 106 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:40.849
 In this also 100 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:51.880
 This is also 106 

00:04:40.849 --> 00:04:57.280
 In is not possible the total movement of the 29 Naoki Kenji because it is the number of the 101 error 25 th 

00:04:51.880 --> 00:05:03.810
 Then we bring in the calculation and 106 multiplied by 25 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:03.810
 How is the number sequence up to 5 times 101 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:09.449
 I think you two 

00:05:05.969 --> 00:05:11.060
 Will you bring to the ends raise fraction in Nara in 

00:05:09.449 --> 00:05:14.300
 It is your own home 

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:16.800
 It is about 53 minutes here 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:20.449
 Then 53 people 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:20.449
 If you take 20, 

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:27.870
 It is this way 

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:30.590
 Heisei 325 

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:30.590
 Naa here 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:38.760
 1325 

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:44.440
 This is why I asked 

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:52.350
 By adding the number of the end to the number of start it because it is important 

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:52.350
 I 'm asking for 106 and there are 25 in total 

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:56.460
 It is good or very important
