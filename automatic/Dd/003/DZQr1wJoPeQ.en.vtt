00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:06.359
 Hello, my name is Vedeneev Evgeny 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:10.200
 I would like to share with you useful 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:12.599
 information my friend advised me 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.150
 try the catalyst of the 21st century 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.490
 enviro tabs 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:17.810
 Here is such a small package 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:20.180
 contains 28 tablets 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:22.579
 Here's a book such a fishka interesting 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:24.619
 detailed information in general sense 

00:00:22.579 --> 00:00:26.660
 such a little package 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:27.199
 helps save 25 percent of your 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:29.869
 fuel 

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:32.629
 besides this, she still cleans our 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:35.170
 the ecology that our 21st century is very 

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:39.429
 dirty from exhaust 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:44.440
 almost breathing strand in general I decided 

00:00:39.429 --> 00:00:47.289
 use try well was configured 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:49.600
 skeptical as used to our 

00:00:47.289 --> 00:00:52.780
 time is a lot of any nonsense sell 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.309
 on the internet but I then here 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:56.589
 good friend maybe you know him 

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:58.780
 the seed of the millers we work with him now 

00:00:56.589 --> 00:01:00.719
 in one team overall I took this one 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:03.879
 drug and began to add flour route 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:06.340
 chevrolet epica two-liter engine 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:09.130
 2007 year average consumption was 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:10.810
 approximately 23 liters since engine 2 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:14.039
 liters you like to eat a lot of car and 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:16.090
 so saving was not very interesting 

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:17.110
 took this little little one 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:21.429
 pill 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:23.800
 I'll show it to you now 

00:01:21.429 --> 00:01:26.580
 little pill 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.580
 little green 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:35.920
 consumed by 25 50 liters of fuel in 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:38.950
 general added the first bug one to 20 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:41.500
 liters per tablet without popolzovalsya 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:44.530
 those who are mine but since not offered my 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:46.470
 good friend i trust him i got up 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:48.970
 enjoy further 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.770
 I sent the second bug to the second bug 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:52.240
 tucked again under 25 liters on 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:53.610
 tablet threw one on top of the need to 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:56.619
 to put 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:59.320
 no improved little dynamics but 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:01.690
 fuel economy is no difference 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:03.640
 I began to doubt very much 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:06.310
 is it worth adding this tool to 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:10.899
 car so as not very sure about it was 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:13.450
 but again I decided to use further from 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:14.110
 3 tanks I decided to refuel up to 30 liters 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:17.319
 one pill 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:20.080
 since read how you use it 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:22.600
 It is written that excessive fuel consumption and 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:25.299
 pills do not need to take took over the failure 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:26.950
 pills 30 liters and that we met 

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:31.750
 tank freud just happened a miracle 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:34.269
 my consumption fell from 23 liters to the 14th 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:36.940
 and it happened from one side I was 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:38.410
 just shocked by and percent i'm even 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:42.790
 I can not count, but on average it's about 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:44.620
 30 30 percent 35 percent turned out 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:48.270
 I do not have onboard computer measurements 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:49.770
 sat by hand but from a point at home 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:51.120
 I have a father who works at the station 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:52.800
 maintenance before 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.540
 use the drug I decided to measure 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:57.060
 words on a special device and 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.650
 gas analyzers sing about by car 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.680
 was 015 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:05.700
 This is quite a bit of admission in Russia. 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:07.920
 one unit and now auto 4 tank 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:10.170

 just pure steam and I'm not polluting 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:19.100
 Ecology with in the city I live in 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:22.410
 Khanty-Mansiysk in the Soviet city 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:24.720
 the town is small but still if everything 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:28.380

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:31.250
 drug we can just save 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:33.240
 our little town is clean and tidy i'm 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:37.020
