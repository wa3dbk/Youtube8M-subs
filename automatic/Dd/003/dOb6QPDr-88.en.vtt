00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
and this is where the redstone wiring

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:51.030 
and this is where the redstone wiring
yes<00:02:47.940> this<00:02:48.940> block<00:02:49.440> contains<00:02:50.440> the<00:02:50.800> pressure

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
yes this block contains the pressure

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.840 
yes this block contains the pressure
plate<00:02:51.280> ice<00:02:51.940> is<00:02:52.480> on<00:02:52.780> this<00:02:52.930> side<00:02:53.170> so<00:02:53.610> when<00:02:54.610> this

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:54.850 
plate ice is on this side so when this

00:02:54.850 --> 00:03:01.920 
plate ice is on this side so when this
wire<00:02:55.480> is<00:02:56.070> lit<00:02:57.070> up<00:02:58.980> this<00:02:59.980> will<00:03:00.610> not<00:03:00.970> be<00:03:01.000> lit<00:03:01.510> up<00:03:01.720> I

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
wire is lit up this will not be lit up I

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:06.540 
wire is lit up this will not be lit up I
happen<00:03:03.270> yeah<00:03:04.270> and<00:03:04.510> then<00:03:04.780> this<00:03:04.930> is<00:03:05.550> transferred

TNT simply strips of red stone two

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:39.650 
TNT simply strips of red stone two
blocks<00:03:33.850> of<00:03:34.060> TNT<00:03:35.100> our<00:03:36.100> a<00:03:36.930> repeater<00:03:37.930> here<00:03:38.280> to

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
blocks of TNT our a repeater here to

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:41.970 
blocks of TNT our a repeater here to
make<00:03:40.660> sure<00:03:40.690> it<00:03:40.959> goes<00:03:41.110> all<00:03:41.350> the<00:03:41.380> way<00:03:41.530> to<00:03:41.560> the<00:03:41.860> end

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:47.970 
make sure it goes all the way to the end
and<00:03:43.440> when<00:03:44.440> I<00:03:44.470> was<00:03:44.650> testing<00:03:45.130> this<00:03:45.610> out<00:03:45.850> I<00:03:46.980> sailed

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:47.980 
and when I was testing this out I sailed

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:51.020 
and when I was testing this out I sailed
the<00:03:48.310> room<00:03:48.459> underneath<00:03:48.850> with<00:03:49.209> water<00:03:49.560> so<00:03:50.560> I

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
the room underneath with water so I

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:54.060 
the room underneath with water so I
didn't<00:03:52.030> explode<00:03:52.330> the<00:03:52.480> whole<00:03:52.630> safe<00:03:52.870> and<00:03:53.590> nor

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:54.070 
didn't explode the whole safe and nor

00:03:54.070 --> 00:04:00.030 
didn't explode the whole safe and nor
the<00:03:54.370> whole<00:03:54.520> house<00:03:54.730> I'm<00:03:55.120> safe<00:03:58.290> see<00:03:59.290> on<00:03:59.410> I<00:03:59.590> can<00:03:59.890> go

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.040 
the whole house I'm safe see on I can go

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:04.560 
the whole house I'm safe see on I can go
in<00:04:00.250> the<00:04:00.459> note<00:04:01.380> i'm<00:04:02.380> not<00:04:02.560> sure<00:04:02.620> what<00:04:03.010> this<00:04:03.570> gate

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:04.570 
in the note i'm not sure what this gate

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:08.270 
in the note i'm not sure what this gate
is<00:04:04.600> called<00:04:05.170> i'm<00:04:05.440> sure<00:04:05.620> it<00:04:05.769> has<00:04:05.950> a<00:04:05.980> name<00:04:06.930> again

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
is called i'm sure it has a name again

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:13.800 
is called i'm sure it has a name again
but<00:04:11.310> i'm<00:04:12.310> not<00:04:12.370> sure<00:04:12.580> exactly<00:04:13.390> what<00:04:13.660> it's

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:13.810 
but i'm not sure exactly what it's

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:19.440 
but i'm not sure exactly what it's
called<00:04:16.560> so<00:04:17.560> this<00:04:17.950> is<00:04:18.160> a<00:04:18.190> pressure<00:04:18.489> plate<00:04:18.760> where

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:19.450 
called so this is a pressure plate where

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:25.400 
called so this is a pressure plate where
it<00:04:20.020> goes<00:04:20.169> in<00:04:20.410> when<00:04:21.039> this<00:04:21.190> is<00:04:21.400> off<00:04:21.669> as<00:04:22.510> it<00:04:22.750> is<00:04:22.870> now

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:25.410 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:29.730 

originally<00:04:26.410> this<00:04:26.650> one<00:04:27.190> is<00:04:27.400> off<00:04:27.640> and<00:04:27.910> off<00:04:28.650> so<00:04:29.650> it

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:29.740 
originally this one is off and off so it

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:36.180 
originally this one is off and off so it
looks<00:04:29.800> like<00:04:30.390> this<00:04:31.390> from<00:04:31.840> this<00:04:32.050> one<00:04:32.229> no<00:04:33.360> yes<00:04:35.190> it

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:36.190 
looks like this from this one no yes it

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:38.969 
looks like this from this one no yes it
looks<00:04:36.430> like<00:04:36.700> this<00:04:36.940> for<00:04:37.600> them<00:04:37.750> this<00:04:37.990> point<00:04:38.289> when

00:04:38.969 --> 00:04:38.979 
looks like this for them this point when

00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:41.820 
looks like this for them this point when
this<00:04:39.370> one<00:04:39.610> becomes<00:04:40.000> lift<00:04:40.300> i<00:04:40.570> have<00:04:40.900> a<00:04:40.930> delay

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:41.830 
this one becomes lift i have a delay

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:44.880 
this one becomes lift i have a delay
here<00:04:41.860> and<00:04:42.479> then<00:04:43.479> it<00:04:43.780> goes<00:04:43.900> over<00:04:44.080> here<00:04:44.380> and<00:04:44.590> the

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:44.890 
here and then it goes over here and the

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:48.480 
here and then it goes over here and the
squire<00:04:45.190> is<00:04:45.370> off<00:04:45.610> when<00:04:46.390> this<00:04:46.539> one<00:04:46.750> is<00:04:46.780> off<00:04:47.490> just

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:48.490 
squire is off when this one is off just

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:51.990 
squire is off when this one is off just
like<00:04:48.550> that<00:04:48.640> now<00:04:49.090> a<00:04:49.120> cow<00:04:49.450> one<00:04:49.750> oh<00:04:51.039> I<00:04:51.280> cows

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:52.000 
like that now a cow one oh I cows

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:58.850 
like that now a cow one oh I cows
that<00:04:52.390> come<00:04:52.660> with<00:04:52.900> pressure<00:04:53.169> Victor<00:04:57.090> but

00:04:58.850 --> 00:04:58.860 
that come with pressure Victor but

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:02.070 
that come with pressure Victor but
that's<00:04:59.860> showing<00:05:00.850> you<00:05:00.940> basically<00:05:01.330> how<00:05:01.600> it

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:02.080 
that's showing you basically how it

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:06.200 
that's showing you basically how it
works<00:05:02.560> I<00:05:03.070> hope<00:05:03.280> you<00:05:03.460> enjoyed<00:05:03.729> this<00:05:03.880> video<00:05:04.180> and

anyways no I don't survive ok
destruction<00:05:14.860> the<00:05:15.070> basement<00:05:15.490> is<00:05:15.640> safe<00:05:16.180> from

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:16.780 
destruction the basement is safe from

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:19.680 
destruction the basement is safe from
tnt<00:05:17.620> shocks<00:05:18.010> and<00:05:18.490> here<00:05:18.729> comes<00:05:18.970> water<00:05:19.240> flowing

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:19.690 
tnt shocks and here comes water flowing

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:24.270 
tnt shocks and here comes water flowing
in<00:05:19.979> yeah<00:05:20.979> that's<00:05:21.789> my<00:05:22.030> video<00:05:22.360> a<00:05:23.010> different<00:05:24.010> kind

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:24.280
