00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:05.640
 a job some special jobs 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.859
 that the production team of which I 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.750
 I also play part for everyone 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.420
 you with much effort and much 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.809
 dedication in this part of garden pérez 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.010
 we are talking about digital television 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:18.980
 what are those benefits that we 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.539
 contributes what the government does 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:23.760
 revolutionary to keep improving and 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.070
 give users and users this 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:30.289
 new way of watching television does not 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.289
 I speak more and see that this work continues 

00:00:33.219 --> 00:00:38.720
 everything is ready so that in Venezuela 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:41.840
 start the transition to television 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:44.329
 digital the long-awaited blackout of the 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:47.390
 analog television is now a fact 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:50.570
 close that will give way to the beginning of the 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:52.670
 it was digital in our country but it knows 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:54.449
 what is the difference between one and 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:57.340
 other 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.649
 analog television consists of 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:02.379
 emission of images through waves 

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:05.019
 electromagnetic propagated by a 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:08.200
 earthly transmitting station the 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:10.659
 contrast digital television brings us 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:13.720
 Novel benefits codifies its 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:17.259
 signals in binary form what allows 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:20.619
 transmitting various signals via a 

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:22.780
 same channel also enables the 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:25.240
 possibility of creating return path 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:27.399
 between the user and the producer of 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:30.759
 content through applications 

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:33.490
 interactive converting the viewer 

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:36.880
 in an active agent of communication 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:38.909
 since he can access from the 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:42.820
 television with internet services 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:44.880
 teletext radio subtitles and many 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:48.090
 other services more 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:50.729
 let's see the following example could be 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.670
 broadcast a video image two channels 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.560
 audio and several data that is to say 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.720
 can broadcast a football match 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.670
 that would be the image the two signals of 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.979
 audio that could be the selection of 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.869
 language and at the same time the signal of 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:06.119
 data are showing subtitles 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:10.830
 statistics and comments from 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:13.370
 Digital television viewers 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:16.470
 another particularity and that is that its format 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:18.840
 allows the signal to be received in 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:21.450
 a portable device like serving 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:24.209
 areas or tablets even when you 're 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:26.900
 movement since the signal depends on the 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:29.720
 Service coverage area 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:34.120
 likewise the tdt as well as 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:34.120
 know is completely free 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.900
 among the available global models 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:41.480
 for digital television venezuela 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:44.630
 adopted in Brazilian Japanese systems 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:47.180
 because closeness to our country since 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:49.569
 in the future it would ensure the purchase of 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.569
 teams 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:59.540
 first let's cover a population 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:02.700
 in 13 cities the rapid deployment 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:04.560
 we will reach about 50 percent 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.660
 of the national population in this same 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.510
 year 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:10.640
 that is to say more than 3.3 million 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:12.890
 Venezuelan homes in the following 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:16.010
 cities heard the coal 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:18.830
 barquisimeto of 4 and of the corrido la 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:19.310
 of the cinemas of I fell in love or participate 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:23.420
 cough 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:24.740
 Guarenas Guatire Caracas La Guaira 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:28.880
 here we have guarenas guatire as a 

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:32.930
 single city are the steps of the guaira 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:35.630
 maracaibo maracay maturín mérida puerto 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:38.960
 the cross puerto ordaz san cristóbal 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:41.530
 Valencia and the set of populations of 

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:41.530
 the valleys of tuy 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:47.989
 in this way our country takes steps 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:50.769
 leaps towards the consolidation of 

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:50.769
 technological sovereignty 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:56.450
 for example 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:02.030
 good and we saw how venezuela 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:05.150
 prepare for this new way of seeing 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:08.650
 television digital television three 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:11.569
 states of venezuela are going to continue 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:13.549
 increasing the use of this type to this 

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:17.290
 new television format then it 

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:17.290
 will understand for the rest of the country
