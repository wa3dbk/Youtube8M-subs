00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:13.810 
just to kind of give the fans a
side-by-side<00:02:11.090> comparison<00:02:11.450> on<00:02:12.320> how<00:02:12.770> big<00:02:13.670> it

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:13.820 
side-by-side comparison on how big it

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:17.290 
side-by-side comparison on how big it
actually<00:02:14.000> is<00:02:15.040> it's<00:02:16.040> very<00:02:16.400> similar<00:02:16.700> I<00:02:17.000> mean<00:02:17.180> to

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
actually is it's very similar I mean to

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.450 
actually is it's very similar I mean to
the<00:02:17.390> hot<00:02:17.480> toys<00:02:17.890> version<00:02:18.890> like<00:02:19.040> I<00:02:19.220> thought<00:02:19.400> I

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:19.460 
the hot toys version like I thought I

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:21.520 
the hot toys version like I thought I
thought<00:02:19.670> it<00:02:19.820> I<00:02:19.850> mean<00:02:20.060> for<00:02:20.900> what<00:02:21.020> it<00:02:21.140> is<00:02:21.290> very

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
thought it I mean for what it is very

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.710 
thought it I mean for what it is very
simple<00:02:22.430> to<00:02:22.550> use<00:02:22.760> like<00:02:23.030> I<00:02:23.120> said<00:02:23.300> I'm<00:02:23.420> not<00:02:23.450> going

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
simple to use like I said I'm not going

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.210 
simple to use like I said I'm not going
to<00:02:23.810> use<00:02:23.960> the<00:02:24.110> actual<00:02:24.380> cable<00:02:24.740> that<00:02:24.860> came<00:02:25.040> with

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
to use the actual cable that came with

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.400 
to use the actual cable that came with
it<00:02:25.250> since<00:02:25.490> I<00:02:25.610> actually<00:02:25.850> have<00:02:26.360> a<00:02:26.390> cable<00:02:27.260> that<00:02:27.380> I

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
it since I actually have a cable that I

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:30.010 
it since I actually have a cable that I
use<00:02:27.650> that<00:02:28.190> was<00:02:28.310> using<00:02:28.550> with<00:02:28.670> the<00:02:28.760> Mophie<00:02:29.060> very

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.020 
use that was using with the Mophie very

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:32.920 
use that was using with the Mophie very
simple<00:02:30.440> plug<00:02:30.710> it<00:02:30.830> in<00:02:31.010> the<00:02:32.000> three<00:02:32.270> LED<00:02:32.660> lights

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
simple plug it in the three LED lights

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:36.640 
simple plug it in the three LED lights
light<00:02:33.230> up<00:02:33.410> and<00:02:34.630> I'm<00:02:35.630> guessing<00:02:35.960> it's<00:02:36.050> about<00:02:36.170> 75%

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
light up and I'm guessing it's about 75%

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:41.710 
light up and I'm guessing it's about 75%
charge<00:02:37.160> now<00:02:37.850> here's<00:02:38.240> the<00:02:38.860> trick<00:02:39.860> is<00:02:40.130> that<00:02:40.720> just

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
charge now here's the trick is that just

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.450 
charge now here's the trick is that just
like<00:02:41.870> the<00:02:41.990> Malfi<00:02:42.320> charger<00:02:42.770> it's<00:02:43.070> not<00:02:43.250> going<00:02:43.400> to

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:43.460 
like the Malfi charger it's not going to

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:45.520 
like the Malfi charger it's not going to
charge<00:02:43.700> while<00:02:44.000> it's<00:02:44.180> plugged<00:02:44.330> in<00:02:44.570> charge<00:02:44.870> and

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
charge while it's plugged in charge and

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:47.440 
charge while it's plugged in charge and
it's<00:02:46.160> not<00:02:46.340> going<00:02:46.520> to<00:02:46.580> turn<00:02:46.790> on<00:02:46.940> unless<00:02:47.210> you<00:02:47.330> hit

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
it's not going to turn on unless you hit

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:50.560 
it's not going to turn on unless you hit
the<00:02:47.600> center<00:02:47.870> button<00:02:48.760> which<00:02:49.760> I<00:02:50.150> guess<00:02:50.390> the

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:50.570 
the center button which I guess the

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:51.880 
the center button which I guess the
Mophie<00:02:50.900> would<00:02:51.050> have<00:02:51.170> the<00:02:51.290> advantage<00:02:51.410> since

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:51.890 
Mophie would have the advantage since

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:53.290 
Mophie would have the advantage since
you<00:02:52.250> don't<00:02:52.340> have<00:02:52.520> to<00:02:52.610> actually<00:02:52.730> hit<00:02:53.060> a<00:02:53.090> button

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:53.300 
you don't have to actually hit a button

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:54.790 
you don't have to actually hit a button
this<00:02:53.480> is<00:02:53.570> probably<00:02:53.870> the<00:02:54.080> only<00:02:54.170> Achilles<00:02:54.620> heel

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:54.800 
this is probably the only Achilles heel

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.350 
this is probably the only Achilles heel
that<00:02:54.950> I<00:02:55.100> do<00:02:55.580> not<00:02:55.700> like<00:02:55.910> about<00:02:56.030> it<00:02:56.270> but

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:56.360 
that I do not like about it but

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.300 
that I do not like about it but
otherwise<00:02:56.600> it<00:02:57.230> is<00:02:57.560> still<00:02:57.890> the<00:02:58.070> mark-5

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 
otherwise it is still the mark-5

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:01.210 
otherwise it is still the mark-5
suitcase<00:02:58.970> iron<00:02:59.300> man<00:02:59.480> so<00:02:59.750> they<00:02:59.989> still<00:03:00.290> they
