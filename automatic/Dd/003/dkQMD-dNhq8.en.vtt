00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:07.090
 always and gorings 

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:12.929
 ah 

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:12.929
 hi frijolito 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:21.100
 hello adriana why are you sad no no 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:24.510
 I'm sad 

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:27.900
 If you're sad, tell me what's up 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:30.090
 the truth the truth I feel sad because 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.460
 next Monday will be the first contest 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.290
 of sciences and in my school 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.970
 wow this sounds very father and sure already 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.330
 you have something very prepared and I know that 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:38.330
 you will win 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:47.720
 That's what has me sad I do not have 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:50.840
 a project to carry all the 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:54.200
 Frijolitos have already made theirs and I have not 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:56.960
 I have one quiet frijolito must 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:59.000
 have a solution 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:01.879
 there is very little time left for the 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:06.610
 contest I had one but my mom what 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:06.610
 shot by mistake and now I do not know what to say 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:12.240
 How bad that happened but not 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.070
 you should worry about tmc several 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:19.229
 experiments that could help you if 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:22.220
 I want I can really help you great 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:24.690
 thank you very much to come is a great friend 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:26.729
 you have nothing to thank frijolito 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:29.700
 for that we are the friends but now 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:33.290
 tell me what you would like to do and the truth 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:36.979
 I do not have anything special that suggests me 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:40.229
 I hear about the magic sand 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:42.690
 like that of aladi 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:46.429
 no frijolito that is called carpet 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:46.429
 magic and no it is not that 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:50.820
 I do not know 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.740
 because the magic sand is the one in which 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.750
 we all know but with a little secret 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:58.080
 that makes when we put it in the water 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:00.310
 unmute get wet and you know of any 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.770
 experiment of that 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:06.909
 yes indeed and I remember some super 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:09.220
 interesting wow I love the idea very 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:12.240
 well now I know what my project will be 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:15.080
 of science for the contest 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:19.490
 which seriously 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:21.500
 because the wind will teach me like that and it's 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:23.780
 well pretty good but now we should go 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:27.200
 for the materials 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:29.690
 true let's go for them today adrián 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.850
 inspires what happens 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:34.030
 we were able to teach them and the experiment 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:38.650
 also our little friends who see us 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:42.220
 clear that if we go for them 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:44.420
 for our experiment we need 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:46.770
 sand 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:50.880
 with glasses 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:53.190
 a waterproofing and liquid spoon 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:55.080
 and I always say it's dangerous children 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:03:01.040
 that's why they need the help of an adult 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:01.040
 to buy it and use it and a colander 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:08.290
 first strain the sand so you have 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:08.290
 very pretty and do not have pebbles 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.830
 I think millions 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:23.139
 and now 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:31.160
 and that year 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:31.160
 is called 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:40.760
 always the flour on a bag of 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:40.760
 plastic to put it like this the sun 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:56.489
 after it is already well dry point 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:59.480
 flour in the water and look what happens already 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:59.480
 they do not get wet 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:11.689
 like her 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:23.210
 and it happens because the waterproofing and 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:25.729
 I create a protective cap around 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:27.670
 the flour and serves as a shield for whom 

00:04:25.729 --> 00:04:32.730
 we do 

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:32.730
 Well I like to do 

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:49.899
 it's ready but the magical frijolitos 

00:04:46.989 --> 00:04:52.419
 he plays some I want very nice children and is 

00:04:49.899 --> 00:04:54.339
 very good entity already has rhythms its 

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:57.279
 project and with this it works very well 

00:04:54.339 --> 00:04:58.929
 thank you very much to adrián for your help my 

00:04:57.279 --> 00:05:00.639
 friends and teachers will be surprised 

00:04:58.929 --> 00:05:02.860
 with my movements 

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:04.899
 thank you very much always to start 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:06.039
 help you very nice but now I have 

00:05:04.899 --> 00:05:10.469
 to go with our little friends from 

00:05:06.039 --> 00:05:10.469
 study I'm running so see you 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:21.580
 this has been all children until next time 

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:24.300
 we read goodbye to each other 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:24.300
 Y
