00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:56.040 
way that it does this game is really

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:57.470 
way that it does this game is really
freaking<00:04:56.490> cool<00:04:56.520> but<00:04:56.880> it's<00:04:57.000> also<00:04:57.150> pretty

00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:57.480 
freaking cool but it's also pretty

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:58.880 
freaking cool but it's also pretty
difficult<00:04:57.780> I<00:04:58.020> feel<00:04:58.200> like<00:04:58.320> you<00:04:58.440> get<00:04:58.680> the<00:04:58.740> hang
