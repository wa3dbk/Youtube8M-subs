 to the second video of the day terminals to a 

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:16.400
 video in which I'm going to teach to put is 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:18.350
 a game in which we can dock the 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.450
 good bank not quite how will it come out 

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:21.860
 but good is like a stimulation and 

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:24.320
 we can do with our friends and 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:25.730
 we have enough and as always I have 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:27.080
 a part to the description you only have 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.150
 to add to the game with your account 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:31.520
 of social club and you will already have here as 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:33.350
 You see in captures so well let's go 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:35.870
 to give and you will see that it is a pass 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:38.180
 ok we complete the adjustments and all that 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:40.280
 and we choose the equipment worth we have to 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:42.470
 it's the maximum I do not know how many players 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.630
 but good I got with the friends that is 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:46.520
 what is cool we will appear here and we 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:49.489
 we will have to go to the car and 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:51.950
 to go to what the bank is worth so 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:54.470
 we take the cars as you see me get on and 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:55.940
 we 're going to go to the bank good as 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:58.430
 I have already said it is not all that is going to be 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:00.649
 in the new update or when it comes out 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:02.630
 but hey it's like a simulation and it's 

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:05.610
 pretty cool since it's already your team 

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:07.950
 from the bank and he is very handsome 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.990

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.270
