 Come to the Castle of the Lion King 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:28.489
 Errors are helping people. 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:35.309
 So today, but until now, I've been following this story so breathlessly 

00:00:28.489 --> 00:00:38.940
 I think I did not do violence by throwing a dungeon. So it's a little late . 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:41.850
 I do not see it . 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:45.329
 You've seen a lot of them. 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:49.350
 For those who have not been able to see the level 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:53.309
 I guess we should take a little more time with Seoul. 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:57.109
 There's no quick pledge . 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.109
 Dahon, I'll be fine. 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:06.550

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:12.240
 No, it was not. 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:14.870

 It is difficult to capture four of the 147 level in the morning 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:54.100
 Iteunikka am going to see here different from one language to express this as a separate party
