00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
 welcome to niklas old 12 in 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:07.170
 I would like to nvidias this video 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:08.370
 new goes ex 950 with a dsl 73 70 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.780
 Compare graphics card 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.519
 This could be an interesting comparison 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.670
 Which one should you choose for yourself 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:13.670
 decide 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:21.270
 the getec 950 he currently costs the 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.090
 a few more than the 73 videos 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.630
 seventies nothing extreme but definitely 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.580
 noticeable 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.180
 Let's see how good this costume is 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.180
 to look 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.460
 the 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:31.140
 So you clearly judge by yourself 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:33.150
 Guessing the gags 950 he won him 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.090
 so to speak, every game in this test 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.780
 but a dsl 73 70 does not hang far 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.190
 after 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.990
 sometimes only one or two 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:40.350
 Pictures per second which is very acceptable 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.750
 is 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.850
 since the 73 70 currently less 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.640
 costs the power consumption is at the r 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:50.910
 73 70 lower the temperatures for it 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.320
 but higher than the 6 950 over both 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:54.570
 but you should not worry 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.580
 that two are very efficient 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:02:00.210
 as far as the wm is concerned both have the 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:03.180
 g650 as well as the a 73 70 over 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:05.970
 two gigabytes of gddr5 memory but the 73rd 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.770
 70 he also exists in 4 gb variants of 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:09.000
 price then increases drastically and 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.580
 I do not think that this is still 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.300
 worthwhile is so much more just for that 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.610
 output 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.590
 So which is probably the best choice one 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:19.410
 hard decision but i think so 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.820
 would probably rather reach for the 73 70th 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.800
 what about you leave me yours 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:24.600
 hopefully has opinions 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.590
 This is a short video for you as 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.390
 proved helpful 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.370
 and maybe you know more now 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.020
 thank you for these two graphics cards 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.000
