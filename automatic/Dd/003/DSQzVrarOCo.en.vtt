pedal<00:02:04.619> you<00:02:04.860> want<00:02:05.040> to<00:02:05.100> push<00:02:05.369> up<00:02:06.320> towards<00:02:07.320> the

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
pedal you want to push up towards the

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.920 
pedal you want to push up towards the
footwell<00:02:08.780> and<00:02:09.780> it<00:02:10.350> lifts<00:02:10.619> out<00:02:10.739> just<00:02:11.070> like<00:02:11.220> that

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
footwell and it lifts out just like that

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:16.340 
footwell and it lifts out just like that
you<00:02:12.930> can<00:02:13.110> see<00:02:13.350> right<00:02:13.530> here<00:02:14.720> this<00:02:15.720> cable<00:02:16.200> right

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
you can see right here this cable right

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:18.170 
you can see right here this cable right
here<00:02:16.410> is<00:02:16.920> basically<00:02:17.489> what<00:02:17.640> we're<00:02:17.790> going<00:02:17.970> to<00:02:18.060> be

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
here is basically what we're going to be

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.360 
here is basically what we're going to be
taking<00:02:18.510> the<00:02:18.630> Sprint<00:02:18.930> booster<00:02:19.290> and<00:02:19.470> putting<00:02:20.250> in

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
taking the Sprint booster and putting in

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.820 
taking the Sprint booster and putting in
series<00:02:20.790> we're<00:02:21.510> gonna<00:02:21.600> disconnect<00:02:22.320> it<00:02:22.590> here

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
series we're gonna disconnect it here

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.530 
series we're gonna disconnect it here
we're<00:02:23.280> gonna<00:02:23.370> put<00:02:23.610> the<00:02:23.730> Sprint<00:02:24.060> Booster<00:02:24.180> there

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
we're gonna put the Sprint Booster there

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.570 
we're gonna put the Sprint Booster there
and<00:02:24.750> then<00:02:24.930> we're<00:02:25.019> gonna<00:02:25.110> plug<00:02:25.470> the<00:02:26.100> cable<00:02:26.459> that

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
and then we're gonna plug the cable that

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.020 
and then we're gonna plug the cable that
goes<00:02:26.640> to<00:02:27.060> your<00:02:27.269> throttle<00:02:27.810> body<00:02:28.940> into<00:02:29.940> the

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
goes to your throttle body into the

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:36.949 
goes to your throttle body into the
other<00:02:30.150> end<00:02:30.360> of<00:02:30.420> speed<00:02:30.630> booster

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:42.210 

comes<00:02:37.959> up<00:02:38.110> just<00:02:38.140> like<00:02:38.380> that<00:02:40.950> the<00:02:41.950> Sprint

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
comes up just like that the Sprint

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.070 
comes up just like that the Sprint
Booster<00:02:42.340> selectable<00:02:42.940> model<00:02:43.330> has<00:02:43.540> a<00:02:43.569> module

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080 
Booster selectable model has a module

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.010 
Booster selectable model has a module
that<00:02:44.500> connects<00:02:44.830> to<00:02:45.790> it<00:02:45.970> and<00:02:46.209> this<00:02:46.569> allows<00:02:46.870> you

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:47.020 
that connects to it and this allows you

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:50.160 
that connects to it and this allows you
to<00:02:47.050> select<00:02:47.260> the<00:02:47.590> different<00:02:47.709> modes<00:02:48.130> I<00:02:49.050> like<00:02:50.050> to

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
to select the different modes I like to

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:56.009 
to select the different modes I like to
plug<00:02:50.440> this<00:02:50.650> in<00:02:50.890> first<00:02:52.170> before<00:02:53.170> we<00:02:53.410> plug<00:02:53.769> in<00:02:55.019> the

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:56.019 
plug this in first before we plug in the

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:58.680 
plug this in first before we plug in the
module<00:02:56.410> to<00:02:56.590> our<00:02:56.769> pedal<00:02:57.400> assembly<00:02:57.580> here<00:02:57.910> now

I'm<00:02:58.840> gonna<00:02:58.989> plug<00:02:59.200> in<00:02:59.410> this<00:02:59.890> end<00:03:00.599> to<00:03:01.599> our<00:03:01.630> pedal

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:01.989 
I'm gonna plug in this end to our pedal

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:04.440 
I'm gonna plug in this end to our pedal
assembly<00:03:02.610> you<00:03:03.610> can<00:03:03.640> hear<00:03:03.940> it's<00:03:04.150> got<00:03:04.239> a<00:03:04.269> nice

I'll check the connection make sure that
it's<00:03:51.580> secure

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:55.750 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:57.970

this way and pull on the wire and that

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:04.990 
this way and pull on the wire and that
looks<00:04:02.420> like<00:04:02.540> a<00:04:02.599> nice<00:04:03.610> positive<00:04:04.610> connection

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:05.000 
looks like a nice positive connection

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:11.440 
next thing I'm going to do I'm going to
route<00:04:07.489> my<00:04:07.840> wires<00:04:08.840> around<00:04:09.230> the<00:04:09.319> back<00:04:10.239> as<00:04:11.239> much

this wire away and out of your way of
the<00:04:20.750> pedal<00:04:21.610> we'll<00:04:22.610> do<00:04:22.729> that<00:04:22.880> in<00:04:23.000> a<00:04:23.060> minute<00:04:23.500> for

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:24.500 
the pedal we'll do that in a minute for

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:27.070 
the pedal we'll do that in a minute for
now<00:04:25.000> I'm<00:04:26.000> going<00:04:26.120> to<00:04:26.210> go<00:04:26.360> and<00:04:26.570> try<00:04:26.720> to<00:04:26.750> find<00:04:26.840> the

now I'm going to go and try to find the

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.890 
now I'm going to go and try to find the
clip<00:04:27.320> at<00:04:27.410> the<00:04:27.470> top<00:04:27.710> that<00:04:28.190> you<00:04:28.250> slide<00:04:28.610> into<00:04:28.900> free
