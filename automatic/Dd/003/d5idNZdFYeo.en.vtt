00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
resident killer whales which are a

highly contaminated group of whales and

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:21.560 
highly contaminated group of whales and
this<00:00:20.099> contamination<00:00:20.759> is<00:00:20.880> a<00:00:20.910> huge<00:00:21.150> risk<00:00:21.360> factor

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
this contamination is a huge risk factor

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.620 
this contamination is a huge risk factor
looking<00:00:22.470> at<00:00:22.619> the<00:00:22.830> transfer<00:00:23.550> of<00:00:23.630> contaminants

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
looking at the transfer of contaminants

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.150 
looking at the transfer of contaminants
during<00:00:24.750> the<00:00:24.930> lactation<00:00:25.259> process<00:00:25.830> from<00:00:26.040> the

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
during the lactation process from the

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.279 
during the lactation process from the

female to her calf one of the key
factors<00:00:28.619> that<00:00:28.949> we're<00:00:29.100> missing<00:00:29.460> is<00:00:29.640> what<00:00:29.699> is

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
factors that we're missing is what is

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.600 
factors that we're missing is what is
the<00:00:30.630> offload<00:00:31.170> from<00:00:31.949> the<00:00:32.010> mom<00:00:32.160> of<00:00:32.189> the<00:00:32.400> calf

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
the offload from the mom of the calf

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.460 
the offload from the mom of the calf
during<00:00:33.030> lactation<00:00:33.180> what<00:00:33.660> percent<00:00:34.050> of<00:00:34.170> each<00:00:34.350> of

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:34.470 
during lactation what percent of each of

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:35.990 
during lactation what percent of each of
the<00:00:34.530> contaminants<00:00:35.070> that<00:00:35.100> we<00:00:35.190> look<00:00:35.400> at<00:00:35.610> are

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
the contaminants that we look at are

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.160 
the contaminants that we look at are
offloaded<00:00:36.510> and<00:00:36.600> we<00:00:36.660> can't<00:00:36.870> get<00:00:36.960> that<00:00:37.110> through

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
offloaded and we can't get that through

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.869 
offloaded and we can't get that through
the<00:00:37.379> wild<00:00:37.620> whale<00:00:37.769> so<00:00:38.010> we're<00:00:38.129> looking<00:00:38.640> at<00:00:38.730> that

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
the wild whale so we're looking at that

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.720 
the wild whale so we're looking at that
here<00:00:39.330> and<00:00:39.480> the<00:00:40.050> whales<00:00:40.199> at<00:00:40.559> SeaWorld<00:00:40.620> so<00:00:41.610> that

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
here and the whales at SeaWorld so that

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.250 
here and the whales at SeaWorld so that
we<00:00:41.820> can<00:00:41.940> actually<00:00:42.150> quantify<00:00:42.390> that<00:00:42.900> percent

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
we can actually quantify that percent

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.479 
we can actually quantify that percent
offload<00:00:43.530> and<00:00:43.650> actually<00:00:43.920> populate<00:00:44.339> those

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:00.540 
great opportunity for us to collaborate

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:03.020 
great opportunity for us to collaborate
with<00:01:00.869> researchers<00:01:01.619> that<00:01:02.250> are<00:01:02.400> focusing<00:01:02.850> on

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
with researchers that are focusing on

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.329 
with researchers that are focusing on
wild<00:01:03.360> populations<00:01:03.989> it<00:01:04.409> gives<00:01:04.680> us<00:01:04.860> a<00:01:05.010> sense<00:01:05.190> of

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
wild populations it gives us a sense of

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.310 
wild populations it gives us a sense of
purpose<00:01:05.549> to<00:01:06.150> help<00:01:06.659> with<00:01:06.960> these<00:01:07.080> studies

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
purpose to help with these studies

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.530 
purpose to help with these studies
because<00:01:07.799> we<00:01:07.950> know<00:01:08.100> we<00:01:08.729> have<00:01:08.880> an<00:01:09.000> effect<00:01:09.270> on<00:01:09.360> our

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
because we know we have an effect on our

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.990 
because we know we have an effect on our
oceans<00:01:10.020> and<00:01:10.260> to<00:01:10.650> what<00:01:10.799> effect<00:01:10.890> we<00:01:11.250> are<00:01:11.729> still

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
oceans and to what effect we are still

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.429 
oceans and to what effect we are still
learning<00:01:12.210> and<00:01:12.540> that's<00:01:12.689> the<00:01:12.900> crazy<00:01:13.140> thing<00:01:13.260> is

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
learning and that's the crazy thing is

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:14.840 
learning and that's the crazy thing is
we<00:01:13.680> have<00:01:13.770> so<00:01:13.979> much<00:01:14.159> to<00:01:14.340> learn<00:01:14.460> from<00:01:14.520> our

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
we have so much to learn from our

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.910 
we have so much to learn from our
animals<00:01:15.240> and<00:01:15.450> by<00:01:15.870> having<00:01:16.140> animals<00:01:16.530> in<00:01:16.770> our

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
animals and by having animals in our

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.730 
animals and by having animals in our
care<00:01:17.190> we're<00:01:17.880> able<00:01:18.030> to<00:01:18.300> actually<00:01:18.660> help<00:01:19.170> that

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
care we're able to actually help that

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.950 
care we're able to actually help that
effort<00:01:20.100> in<00:01:20.430> and<00:01:20.790> actually<00:01:21.030> learn<00:01:21.570> from<00:01:21.600> our

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
effort in and actually learn from our

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.480 
effort in and actually learn from our
animals<00:01:22.320> so<00:01:22.500> that<00:01:22.680> we<00:01:22.770> can<00:01:22.890> actually<00:01:23.280> help

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
animals so that we can actually help

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.160 
animals so that we can actually help
wild<00:01:23.850> populations<00:01:24.450> the<00:01:24.690> reason<00:01:24.990> why<00:01:25.110> this

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
wild populations the reason why this

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.590 
wild populations the reason why this

important<00:01:28.200> to<00:01:28.320> all<00:01:28.410> of<00:01:28.440> us<00:01:28.650> here<00:01:28.890> at<00:01:28.980> SeaWorld

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
important to all of us here at SeaWorld

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.370 
important to all of us here at SeaWorld
is<00:01:29.940> that<00:01:30.120> because<00:01:30.420> of<00:01:30.570> our<00:01:30.660> relationships

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
is that because of our relationships

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.010 
is that because of our relationships

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.080 
with Alia and now starting with Amaya
we're<00:01:34.500> able<00:01:34.620> to<00:01:34.950> get<00:01:35.160> the<00:01:35.340> information<00:01:35.610> that

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
we're able to get the information that

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.810 
we're able to get the information that
we<00:01:36.240> need<00:01:36.450> from<00:01:36.840> her<00:01:37.020> and<00:01:37.170> her<00:01:37.290> cab<00:01:37.820> transfer

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
we need from her and her cab transfer

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.060 
we need from her and her cab transfer
this<00:01:39.000> over<00:01:39.420> to<00:01:39.720> the<00:01:39.870> researchers<00:01:40.380> in<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:40.650> wild

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
this over to the researchers in the wild

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.610 
this over to the researchers in the wild
so<00:01:41.550> that<00:01:41.700> we<00:01:41.820> can<00:01:42.000> ascertain<00:01:42.600> how<00:01:43.409> these

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:43.620 
so that we can ascertain how these
