I<00:06:23.610> don't<00:06:23.759> know<00:06:23.819> but<00:06:24.449> I'm<00:06:25.020> not<00:06:25.199> watching<00:06:25.500> the

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:25.560 
I don't know but I'm not watching the

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:28.550 
I don't know but I'm not watching the
commentary<00:06:25.979> right<00:06:26.159> now<00:06:26.310> but<00:06:27.110> you<00:06:28.110> know<00:06:28.229> clutch

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:28.560 
commentary right now but you know clutch

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:31.550 
commentary right now but you know clutch
because<00:06:28.740> the<00:06:29.430> other<00:06:29.580> guy<00:06:29.699> had<00:06:29.879> 29<00:06:30.300> and<00:06:30.659> I<00:06:31.349> had
