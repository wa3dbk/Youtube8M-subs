00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.449
 brought we plant reader and viewer 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:05.430
 Internet resource mega review dot com 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:07.919
 seen as on tests external hard drive 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.679
 from the company toshiba this is the model of chairs on 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:13.290
 2 terabytes model got replenished 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.120
 she and the new line so that before 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.490
 own model 1 terabyte now we 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.529
 we have two more memory at the very 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.119
 Delight 2 bedroom inch wheels with such 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.060
 volume began to appear already 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:27.960
 relatively long ago new technologies 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.730
 placing memory on the plates and in fact 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.900
 such compact discs are a little inferior 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.800
 to their elder brethren 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:37.200
 plus yuzbi 30 came with us and 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.629
 actively implemented now it is essentially 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.250
 there is not even a difference in cost between 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.800
 beaten 20 or 30 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.620
 flash drives have become available on 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.030
 cost as well as on maternal 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.039
 the boards now we see these connectors are all 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.620
 more often and laptops naturally includes 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.750
 atrophy so back to the hard drive 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.989
 delivered tough compact disc 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.670
 soft cardboard packaging on the front 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.949
 side of the hard disk image 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.170
 data on the amount of memory given 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.900
 backing beaten 30 on the back 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:10.920
 whether benefit can hurt itself 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:13.770
 differences from bi 2 0 yuzbi 30 in fact she's 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.950
 ideally makes 10 times the difference goes 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.930
 but according to the real test approximately 7 8 times 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.570
 on the same disk you can get 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.100
 difference in speed and 100 this moment 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.530
 consider if you need a lit disk 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:29.040
 connect krisby 30 unless he will 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:31.229
 work on out of battle and so drive too 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:34.140
 delighted at 2 terabytes made in 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.600
 compact case 2 centimeters thick 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.900
 this is not the thinnest body to the current 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.759
 May, but such is the average 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:43.619
 the body is made of matte plastic it 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:46.259
 black is the minimum of elements 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:48.840
 this is actually usb connector if by the way you 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:51.180
 don't know a little trick and you lost 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.159
 yusbi 30 cable connect this drive 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.010
 can and using the usual microusb 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.290
 cable we can and here 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:02:00.080
 actually any connector turned out here 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:02.300
 here yusbi 20 mode that is this 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:04.390
 a small chip is a louise game 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:07.220
 the actual connector so there is 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:09.590
 the LED flashes blue and that's actually 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:11.990
 all that can be said about the external case 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:14.810
 assembled perfectly squeaks and backlash details 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:16.730
 no but something so bright in the background 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.860
 competitors this model also can not 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:22.700
 highlight practical 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:24.530
 ascetic practical ascetic design 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.750
 let's look at the data 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:29.480
 synthetic tests connects with us 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.920
 drive to the lesbian connector 30 we use 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.900
 comprehensive test here to drive 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:35.720
 several times we are with injured data and 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:39.980
 we take the average results obtained in 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:43.130
 testing time summing up i 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:46.010
 I want to note that the actual usb 30 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:48.860
 connector and also in the direction of 2 terabytes 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:51.470
 providing the expected data is not here 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:53.090
 no records but with his task 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:55.910
 reading speed and copes on 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:58.100
 excellent speed high complies 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:00.670
 this standard is still hanging during 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:04.190
 no work was recorded from the disks 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:05.570
 does its job perfectly well and 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:09.380
 somehow stand out from the competition 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:11.450
 service comes to the fore the question 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:14.660
 worth whether to overpay 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:17.660
 against cheaper models of course 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:19.489
 it's up to you but this model of Toshiba and in 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:22.400
 this brand has its fans 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:24.769
 and plus the manufacturer gives us two whole 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:26.120
 sell respect gift for attention 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:30.190
 subscribe to our channel put 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:30.190
 thanks everyone and bye bye
