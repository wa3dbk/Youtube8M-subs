the most coherent case he has up until

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
now for a military action I think it

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.839 
now for a military action I think it
will<00:00:24.689> have<00:00:24.900> zero<00:00:25.560> effect<00:00:25.859> on<00:00:26.340> the<00:00:26.490> needle

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.120 
will have zero effect on the needle
either<00:00:27.599> in<00:00:27.840> Congress<00:00:28.320> or<00:00:28.529> in<00:00:28.680> the<00:00:28.800> public

way<00:00:31.560> you<00:00:31.619> did<00:00:32.059> there's<00:00:33.059> one<00:00:33.329> sort<00:00:33.600> of

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
way you did there's one sort of

is a fiction and in fact the only reason

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.399 
is a fiction and in fact the only reason
that<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:07.979> French<00:01:08.369> are<00:01:08.790> with<00:01:09.210> us<00:01:09.390> on<00:01:09.600> this<00:01:09.810> is

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
that the French are with us on this is

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.609 
that the French are with us on this is
because<00:01:10.860> Syria<00:01:11.340> and<00:01:11.549> Lebanon<00:01:12.090> our<00:01:12.619> former

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
because Syria and Lebanon our former

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.399 
because Syria and Lebanon our former
semi<00:01:13.950> colonies<00:01:14.580> that<00:01:15.240> were<00:01:15.420> given<00:01:15.720> to<00:01:15.930> France

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
semi colonies that were given to France

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.370

after<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:17.009> first<00:01:17.250> world<00:01:17.490> war<00:01:17.640> and<00:01:18.060> as<00:01:18.750> in<00:01:18.990> West

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
after the first world war and as in West

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.429 
after the first world war and as in West
Africa<00:01:19.619> the<00:01:20.189> French<00:01:20.460> will<00:01:20.820> act<00:01:21.090> in<00:01:21.450> places

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
Africa the French will act in places

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.730 
Africa the French will act in places
where<00:01:22.729> they<00:01:23.729> were<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:24.119> colonial<00:01:24.659> power<00:01:24.869> so

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
where they were the colonial power so

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.590 
where they were the colonial power so
it's<00:01:25.920> an<00:01:26.040> expression<00:01:26.310> of<00:01:26.610> French<00:01:26.850> nationalism

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
it's an expression of French nationalism

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.990 
it's an expression of French nationalism
innocent<00:01:27.960> expression<00:01:28.229> of<00:01:29.040> French<00:01:29.400> altruism

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
innocent expression of French altruism

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.090 
innocent expression of French altruism
so<00:01:30.630> that's<00:01:30.840> our<00:01:30.990> one<00:01:31.229> ally<00:01:31.590> in<00:01:31.619> the<00:01:31.860> world<00:01:32.040> I

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
so that's our one ally in the world I

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.859 
so that's our one ally in the world I
remember<00:01:32.490> liberals<00:01:32.909> Democrats<00:01:33.570> were<00:01:33.750> the

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
remember liberals Democrats were the

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.899 
remember liberals Democrats were the
ones<00:01:34.079> who<00:01:34.670> excoriated<00:01:35.670> the<00:01:35.759> Bush

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
ones who excoriated the Bush

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.550 
ones who excoriated the Bush
administration<00:01:36.509> for<00:01:36.659> acting<00:01:36.960> quote

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
administration for acting quote

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.289 
administration for acting quote
unilaterally<00:01:38.310> in<00:01:38.430> Iraq<00:01:38.670> when<00:01:38.850> it<00:01:38.909> had<00:01:39.060> almost

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
unilaterally in Iraq when it had almost

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.170 
unilaterally in Iraq when it had almost
50<00:01:40.200> allies<00:01:40.560> so<00:01:41.189> I<00:01:41.220> think<00:01:41.549> that's<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:41.880> core

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
50 allies so I think that's the core

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.880 
50 allies so I think that's the core
issue<00:01:42.450> and<00:01:42.750> I'm<00:01:42.869> not<00:01:43.049> sure<00:01:43.079> he<00:01:43.350> addressed<00:01:43.710> it

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
issue and I'm not sure he addressed it

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.210 
issue and I'm not sure he addressed it
in<00:01:44.070> a<00:01:44.549> way<00:01:44.729> that<00:01:44.759> will<00:01:45.619> appease<00:01:46.619> any<00:01:46.950> of<00:01:47.130> his

if he escalates

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:15.030 
if he escalates
I<00:02:13.300> think<00:02:13.870> he's<00:02:14.050> probably<00:02:14.350> going<00:02:14.710> to<00:02:14.800> be<00:02:14.890> in<00:02:14.980> a

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
I think he's probably going to be in a

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.190 
I think he's probably going to be in a
position<00:02:15.190> where<00:02:15.460> he<00:02:15.730> has<00:02:15.940> to<00:02:16.180> do<00:02:16.300> something<00:02:16.750> to

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
position where he has to do something to

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.200 
position where he has to do something to
maintain<00:02:17.560> his<00:02:17.770> own<00:02:17.890> credibility<00:02:18.280> so<00:02:18.970> Obama

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:19.210 
maintain his own credibility so Obama

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:21.510 
maintain his own credibility so Obama
doesn't<00:02:19.600> seem<00:02:19.870> to<00:02:19.990> have<00:02:20.110> a<00:02:20.140> plan<00:02:20.500> B<00:02:20.800> but<00:02:21.370> what

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:21.520 
doesn't seem to have a plan B but what

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.010 
doesn't seem to have a plan B but what
struck<00:02:21.940> me<00:02:22.000> and<00:02:22.270> I<00:02:22.330> think<00:02:22.570> is<00:02:22.690> the<00:02:22.840> most

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:23.020 
struck me and I think is the most

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060 
well I this first has struck me is

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:32.130 
well I this first has struck me is
something<00:03:31.300> that<00:03:31.390> should<00:03:31.450> have<00:03:31.780> been<00:03:31.810> done

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:32.140 
something that should have been done

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:34.960 
sooner probably that that I think this

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:37.110 
sooner probably that that I think this
is<00:03:35.170> maybe<00:03:35.470> a<00:03:35.590> toned-down<00:03:35.950> version<00:03:36.130> of<00:03:36.910> what<00:03:37.030> we

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.120 
is maybe a toned-down version of what we

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.120 
is maybe a toned-down version of what we

less of the you know rhetorical flourish
but<00:03:42.730> it's<00:03:42.910> I<00:03:43.120> think<00:03:43.570> it<00:03:43.660> was<00:03:43.780> needed<00:03:44.110> probably

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:44.350 
but it's I think it was needed probably

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:45.990 
but it's I think it was needed probably
sooner<00:03:44.650> in<00:03:44.830> the<00:03:44.950> debate<00:03:45.280> I<00:03:45.490> don't<00:03:45.790> think<00:03:45.850> he

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.000 
sooner in the debate I don't think he

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.580 
sooner in the debate I don't think he
said<00:03:46.180> anything<00:03:46.390> new<00:03:46.750> that's<00:03:46.930> probably<00:03:47.380> going

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:47.590 
said anything new that's probably going

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:50.730 
said anything new that's probably going
to<00:03:47.650> shift<00:03:47.950> anything<00:03:48.610> and<00:03:49.530> frankly<00:03:50.530> I<00:03:50.620> think

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:50.740 
to shift anything and frankly I think

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:53.310 
to shift anything and frankly I think
Americans<00:03:51.310> he's<00:03:52.000> right<00:03:52.210> there<00:03:52.420> war<00:03:52.750> weary<00:03:53.050> and
