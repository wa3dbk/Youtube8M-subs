00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:07.060
 or you usually do stretching really 

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:09.669
 that you feel a tightness and a pain 

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:12.789
 intense I will try to explain you a 

00:00:09.669 --> 00:00:14.650
 little how to handle it and what importance 

00:00:12.789 --> 00:00:18.630
 has above all what importance it has 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:18.630
 know how to handle this pain 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.810
 and is that anyone who has done 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:31.080
 stretches will know that it is something that 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:33.629
 generates sensations of tightness and 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.190
 a burning and many call it pain 

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:37.460
 although I prefer to call it suffering 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:41.870
 very unpleasant 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:44.390
 and is that we see in this image a girl 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:47.030
 doing a smiling stretch 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:50.690
 it really seems like he's enjoying himself before 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:51.800
 of running good that in principle will want 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.019
 say that he is not making a 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.409
 deep enough stretch 

00:00:54.019 --> 00:00:58.579
 and intense enough because 

00:00:56.409 --> 00:01:00.979
 anyone who comes to my office and who 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:03.409
 He stretches the way I do 

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:06.500
 I make them very long in the 

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:10.100
 soft weather at the beginning and what little to 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:13.039
 little are catching intensity rather what 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:16.280
 lives in this other way is very lazy 

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:18.170
 even sports people who are 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.119
 accustomed to real beatings 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:22.910
 five and six hours with the bicycle and 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:24.890
 climb slopes suffering like Cossacks 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:28.220
 when faced with stretching 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:30.289
 muscular it turns out that everything changes and 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:33.320
 in two minutes they are asking me and 

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:36.320
 begging please stop it so that it stops 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:38.810
 stop it seems 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:41.840
 It must be said that suffering 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:45.800
 tightness that is generated when one does 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:48.890
 a stretch emotionally mobilizes 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:52.060
 the person mobilizes what in those 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:54.440
 muscles the energy that in those muscles 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:58.040
 is accumulated I understand that it is a 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:02:01.100
 concept difficult to understand and that already 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:03.290
 air also explaining in other videos 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.060
 but when you do a stretch 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:07.009
 you have to be aware of it and you have 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.770
 be aware of how it is 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:12.830
 living emotionally and above all 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:15.650
 how are you responding to that 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:19.040
 mobilization to those feelings and that 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:20.840
 feeling that can arise there are people 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.180
 that is doing a stretch and what 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.070
 what it gives is scary oh my god that this 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:27.590
 that is going to break his experience 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:28.940
 internal is that there are people who are 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.750
 doing a stretch and that's it 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:33.739
 as poor my suffering 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:35.350
 there are people who are making a 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:38.620
 stretching 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:40.780
 shit makes us angry and the 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:43.780
 anger is very important is very 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:46.630
 important to accept and give give a little 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:49.600
 out and above all be aware of 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:51.910
 what is being mobilized because 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:54.460
 that's what little by little and in a way 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:57.910
 more or less smooth 

00:02:54.460 --> 00:03:02.260
 we have to let it out because if the 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:05.020
 reaction is to squeeze me protect myself 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:07.000
 to not feel that to not feel that 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:09.880
 pain to not feel that bad host 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.610
 so as not to feel that sadness and 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:14.320
 try that poor me or that fear if I 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:17.530
 what we do is simply not 

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:20.410
 let's stretch we will not allow that 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:22.450
 the stretch access that to that 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:24.460
 energy that is stored in the muscles 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:26.830
 we will not allow then actually 

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:28.360
 a change a stretch we are not going to 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:30.670
 achieve absolutely nothing more than 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:32.650
 fight with ourselves for a 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:35.140
 side I'm shooting and shooting and shooting and shooting 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:36.820
 and shot and on the other hand I defend 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:38.890
 I defend is something quite absurd and that 

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:39.819
 we meet him every day and that 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:42.189
 safe 

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:45.370
 you when you stretch many 

00:03:42.189 --> 00:03:48.099
 Sometimes you fall in this same alley without 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:51.040
 output so I recommend when making a 

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:53.170
 stretch keep an eye on what 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:55.139
 that moves and two an attention to the 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:59.019
 breathing and elimination at 

00:03:55.139 --> 00:04:02.099
 I sighed sighing always eliminating this 

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:02.099
 energy that may be 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:06.490
 a way of expressing what one is 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:09.680
 suffering not to leave it inside for 

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:12.110
 hold it to not block it is this 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:15.260
 sigh is with this sigh with which 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:18.320
 we are truly eliminating the 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:21.470
 energy that was held and that 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:23.900
 he kept holding on to that muscle is in 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:26.270
 this sigh where is the key that 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:29.540
 the stretch is truly 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:33.620
 effective and truly durable 

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:37.040
 that's why I hope that after seeing this 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:39.140
 video you face the stretching of another 

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:42.020
 way any way you know that 

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:43.760
 you have in this portal and in this network 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:47.300
 about stretching much more 

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:49.880
 useful information about the duration the 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:51.950
 intensity compensations and other 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:53.120
 lots of things about the 

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:55.030
 stretches 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:58.630
