00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:26.349
 my favorite viewers today i will show you 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:30.789
 how to make an old t-shirt something 

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:33.520
 useful you yourself to request such videos 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:35.140
 what can be made of those who came to 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:35.770
 worthlessness here it came to me 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:38.770
 worthlessness 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:39.579
 of these t-shirts, you can take any 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:42.580
 colors 

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:45.310
 certainly not black anything colored and 

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:49.660
 let's start first thing we need 

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:57.970
 will answer this here edge itself to us 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:59.400
 not needed and then cut the shirt into 5 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:04.409
 strips 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:21.270
 so at first 30 she needed tough and not 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:21.270
 good and now 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:34.359
 approximately here such width we cut off 5 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:34.359
 strips 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:52.690
 such from 5 pieces as I cut five 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:56.440
 stuff and one edge at each strip here 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:02:01.950
 this is where and here is the thickening we 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:01.950
 remove and it turns out such a single 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:22.930
 you need to fix our stripes under 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:24.459
 something under any ie one after another 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:28.110
 we fix 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:37.989
 because now we will do weaving 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:42.489
 here is a statement about it is desirable that they 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:48.030
 were straight up and close up and start 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:51.760
 simple weaving five and five strands 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:57.070
 done very quickly and just put 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:03:05.310
 then here's this here so now I 

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:10.739
 this here this here is ready new 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:10.739
 yes that's it 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:26.760
 this here this here and in the process 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:28.819
 a little tighten the lock here this here 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:33.319
 here that is 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:35.969
 weaving is very simple 

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:39.239
 if the first time does not work 

00:03:35.969 --> 00:03:41.599
 it will turn out 2 that is, it turns out like this 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:41.599
 hit 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:13.129
 turn out 

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:22.310
 and here we are flashing west 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:49.300
 Now 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:49.300
 cut off 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:56.220
 and turn out 

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:10.700
 physically nothing and so now to us 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:14.530
 left to sew beads that is, I 

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:22.760
 I plan to sew and here in these small 

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:28.300
 These small beads here in this region is 

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:28.300
 there will be about 

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:54.090
 because I do not break the thread and skip the hearth 

00:05:38.669 --> 00:05:59.470
 under a layer of this is now the patient could not 

00:05:54.090 --> 00:06:01.889
 pigtail and now the ends can be fastened 

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:06.520
 there is a little bit of excess 

00:06:01.889 --> 00:06:09.389
 so about as much should be just 

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:09.389
 tying up 

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:38.389
 here 

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:04.460
 he
