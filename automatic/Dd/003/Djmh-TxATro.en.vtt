00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
these a lot better because they're a

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:18.800 
these a lot better because they're a
little<00:00:16.770> bit<00:00:16.920> smaller<00:00:17.160> on<00:00:17.460> there<00:00:17.609> I<00:00:18.180> don't<00:00:18.750> know

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
little bit smaller on there I don't know

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.090 
little bit smaller on there I don't know
if<00:00:18.960> it<00:00:19.080> was<00:00:19.170> because<00:00:19.230> they<00:00:19.619> were<00:00:19.680> the<00:00:19.830> Mel<00:00:19.980> or

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
if it was because they were the Mel or

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.260 
if it was because they were the Mel or
what<00:00:20.220> they<00:00:20.340> kinda<00:00:20.520> got<00:00:20.609> squished<00:00:20.910> but<00:00:21.119> like

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
what they kinda got squished but like

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.269 
what they kinda got squished but like
the<00:00:21.390> opening<00:00:21.810> the<00:00:22.230> bottom<00:00:22.619> part<00:00:22.800> of<00:00:22.949> these<00:00:23.070> are

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
the opening the bottom part of these are

illness<00:00:25.260> plastics<00:00:25.769> so<00:00:26.010> I<00:00:26.220> don't<00:00:26.789> think<00:00:27.029> they

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
illness plastics so I don't think they

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:28.580 
illness plastics so I don't think they
could<00:00:27.240> been<00:00:27.420> scaled<00:00:27.720> for<00:00:27.960> that<00:00:28.050> reason<00:00:28.199> but

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
could been scaled for that reason but

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.640 
could been scaled for that reason but
