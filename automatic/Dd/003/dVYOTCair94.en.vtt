hi<00:00:00.539> guys<00:00:00.780> kanya<00:00:01.740> I'm<00:00:01.920> just<00:00:02.070> sitting<00:00:02.429> in

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:02.580 
hi guys kanya I'm just sitting in

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:04.130 
hi guys kanya I'm just sitting in
amongst<00:00:02.879> my<00:00:03.060> guitars<00:00:03.419> and<00:00:03.780> i<00:00:03.810> thought<00:00:03.959> i'd

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:04.140 
amongst my guitars and i thought i'd

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:05.390 
amongst my guitars and i thought i'd
give<00:00:04.350> you<00:00:04.380> a<00:00:04.470> little<00:00:04.620> update<00:00:04.859> about<00:00:05.250> what's

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:05.400 
give you a little update about what's

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:06.829 
give you a little update about what's
going<00:00:05.790> on<00:00:05.879> because<00:00:06.089> I've<00:00:06.240> not<00:00:06.390> said<00:00:06.540> hello

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
going on because I've not said hello

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:09.379 
going on because I've not said hello
went<00:00:07.020> well<00:00:07.259> so<00:00:08.040> the<00:00:08.130> reason<00:00:08.250> this<00:00:08.460> banal<00:00:08.970> video

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
went well so the reason this banal video

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:11.660 
went well so the reason this banal video
is<00:00:09.540> really<00:00:09.809> for<00:00:10.170> a<00:00:10.200> while<00:00:10.260> m<00:00:10.710> is<00:00:11.160> because<00:00:11.580> I've

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
is really for a while m is because I've

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.129 
is really for a while m is because I've
been<00:00:11.700> working<00:00:12.000> on<00:00:12.059> a<00:00:12.090> few<00:00:12.240> other<00:00:12.420> projects<00:00:12.929> and

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
been working on a few other projects and

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.099 
been working on a few other projects and
I'm<00:00:14.130> trying<00:00:14.519> it<00:00:14.610> those<00:00:14.759> finished<00:00:15.269> up<00:00:15.450> before<00:00:15.660> I

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
I'm trying it those finished up before I

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:17.990 
I'm trying it those finished up before I
can<00:00:16.230> make<00:00:16.350> that<00:00:16.529> he<00:00:16.859> was<00:00:16.980> on<00:00:17.070> them<00:00:17.279> so<00:00:17.940> if

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
can make that he was on them so if

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.250 
can make that he was on them so if
you've<00:00:18.119> been<00:00:18.210> following<00:00:18.270> the<00:00:18.690> facebook<00:00:19.080> page

and i feel having link will be here for

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.359 
and i feel having link will be here for
you<00:00:21.570> you'll<00:00:22.439> be<00:00:22.590> finding<00:00:22.980> that<00:00:23.220> i've<00:00:23.340> been

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
you you'll be finding that i've been

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:24.859 
you you'll be finding that i've been
talking<00:00:23.580> a<00:00:23.820> lot<00:00:23.910> about<00:00:23.970> war<00:00:24.359> payables<00:00:24.750> and

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
talking a lot about war payables and

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:26.630 
talking a lot about war payables and
specifically<00:00:25.500> the<00:00:25.560> inductors<00:00:26.250> in<00:00:26.279> water

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
specifically the inductors in water

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.550 
specifically the inductors in water
petals<00:00:27.000> at<00:00:27.210> the<00:00:27.480> basic<00:00:27.750> that<00:00:27.840> coil<00:00:28.230> of<00:00:28.500> copper

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
petals at the basic that coil of copper

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.999 
petals at the basic that coil of copper
wire<00:00:29.310> around<00:00:29.880> a<00:00:30.269> fairy<00:00:30.570> core<00:00:30.990> it<00:00:31.560> does<00:00:31.710> a<00:00:31.740> lot

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
wire around a fairy core it does a lot

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.549 
wire around a fairy core it does a lot
to<00:00:32.070> shape<00:00:32.399> the<00:00:32.550> tone<00:00:32.790> of<00:00:33.059> the<00:00:33.420> wah<00:00:33.570> pedal<00:00:34.140> it's

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
to shape the tone of the wah pedal it's

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.270 
to shape the tone of the wah pedal it's
like<00:00:34.739> a<00:00:34.770> cue<00:00:35.160> valley<00:00:35.610> or<00:00:35.969> a<00:00:36.000> cube<00:00:36.300> peak<00:00:36.570> and

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:37.280 
like a cue valley or a cube peak and

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.770 
like a cue valley or a cube peak and
really<00:00:38.280> it's<00:00:38.489> just<00:00:38.550> an<00:00:38.700> emphasis<00:00:39.239> on<00:00:39.420> an<00:00:39.570> essay

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
really it's just an emphasis on an essay

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.569 
really it's just an emphasis on an essay
on<00:00:39.809> the<00:00:39.989> set<00:00:40.170> of<00:00:40.200> frequencies<00:00:40.440> and<00:00:41.040> that's<00:00:41.309> why

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
on the set of frequencies and that's why

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.340 
on the set of frequencies and that's why
pedal<00:00:41.969> does<00:00:42.090> it<00:00:42.270> just<00:00:42.420> emphasize<00:00:42.870> a<00:00:42.899> certain

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
pedal does it just emphasize a certain

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.690 
pedal does it just emphasize a certain
set<00:00:43.530> of<00:00:43.590> frequencies<00:00:43.739> over<00:00:44.160> the<00:00:44.340> ones<00:00:44.520> that

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
set of frequencies over the ones that

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.389 
set of frequencies over the ones that
you're<00:00:44.820> playing<00:00:45.030> as<00:00:45.270> so<00:00:46.170> different<00:00:46.800> inductors

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
you're playing as so different inductors

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.580 
you're playing as so different inductors
and<00:00:47.690> different<00:00:48.690> inductances<00:00:49.170> different

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
and different inductances different

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.610 
and different inductances different
resistances<00:00:50.219> will<00:00:50.489> create<00:00:51.449> and<00:00:51.660> a<00:00:52.260> different

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
resistances will create and a different

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.619 
resistances will create and a different
sound<00:00:52.860> and<00:00:53.489> I've<00:00:53.789> been<00:00:53.910> find<00:00:54.120> it<00:00:54.239> difficult<00:00:54.360> to

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
sound and I've been find it difficult to

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.229 
sound and I've been find it difficult to
find<00:00:54.899> a<00:00:55.230> high-value<00:00:56.160> replacements<00:00:56.820> so

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
find a high-value replacements so

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.750 
find a high-value replacements so
decided<00:00:57.690> that<00:00:57.989> I<00:00:58.260> would<00:00:58.379> just<00:00:58.649> bounce<00:00:59.520> on

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
decided that I would just bounce on

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.970 
decided that I would just bounce on
myself<00:00:59.969> just<00:01:00.239> went<00:01:00.420> so<00:01:00.600> again<00:01:01.440> those<00:01:01.770> are<00:01:01.829> the

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
myself just went so again those are the

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.110 
myself just went so again those are the
facebook<00:01:02.370> page<00:01:02.489> may<00:01:02.699> have<00:01:02.789> seen<00:01:02.940> this

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
facebook page may have seen this

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.740

contraption<00:01:04.049> that<00:01:04.409> I<00:01:05.339> made<00:01:05.580> it's<00:01:05.850> a<00:01:06.540> very

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
contraption that I made it's a very

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.130 
contraption that I made it's a very
rudimentary<00:01:07.229> very<00:01:08.010> basic<00:01:08.540> coil<00:01:09.540> windows<00:01:09.990> this

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
rudimentary very basic coil windows this

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.080 
rudimentary very basic coil windows this
can<00:01:10.320> be<00:01:10.439> used<00:01:10.560> for<00:01:10.619> pickups<00:01:11.100> or<00:01:11.220> inductor<00:01:11.880> coil

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
can be used for pickups or inductor coil

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.249 
can be used for pickups or inductor coil
and<00:01:12.900> swapping<00:01:13.350> of<00:01:14.130> the<00:01:14.490> hand<00:01:14.729> drill<00:01:15.030> I<00:01:15.270> can't

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
and swapping of the hand drill I can't

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.140 
and swapping of the hand drill I can't
push<00:01:16.680> this<00:01:16.920> little<00:01:17.159> counter<00:01:17.850> there<00:01:18.060> and

copper coil one there I just wind up

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.080 
copper coil one there I just wind up
straight<00:01:23.670> on<00:01:23.820> a<00:01:23.850> bobbin<00:01:24.330> that's<00:01:25.110> a<00:01:25.880> very<00:01:26.880> very

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
straight on a bobbin that's a very very

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.300 
straight on a bobbin that's a very very
basic<00:01:27.540> little<00:01:27.810> setup<00:01:28.290> that<00:01:28.590> made<00:01:28.770> to<00:01:28.920> try<00:01:29.130> and

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
basic little setup that made to try and

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.280 
basic little setup that made to try and
win<00:01:29.460> some<00:01:29.820> stuff<00:01:30.030> hat<00:01:30.299> on<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:30.540> test<00:01:30.780> of<00:01:30.990> chemo

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
win some stuff hat on the test of chemo

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.440 
win some stuff hat on the test of chemo
okay<00:01:31.619> that<00:01:32.400> was<00:01:32.490> a<00:01:32.520> little<00:01:32.549> test<00:01:32.970> and<00:01:33.180> doctor

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
okay that was a little test and doctor

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:34.880 
okay that was a little test and doctor
just<00:01:33.600> to<00:01:33.689> see<00:01:33.720> that<00:01:33.900> it<00:01:34.140> would<00:01:34.290> actually<00:01:34.439> waned

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
just to see that it would actually waned

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.030 
just to see that it would actually waned
and<00:01:35.100> it<00:01:35.220> went<00:01:35.490> really<00:01:35.790> quite<00:01:36.060> neatly<00:01:36.299> and<00:01:37.040> too

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
and it went really quite neatly and too

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.520 
and it went really quite neatly and too
bad<00:01:38.220> that<00:01:38.280> as<00:01:38.850> we<00:01:39.630> below<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:40.079> value<00:01:40.350> that<00:01:40.380> I

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
bad that as we below the value that I

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.069 
bad that as we below the value that I
need<00:01:40.770> for<00:01:40.799> a<00:01:41.070> lion<00:01:41.310> doctor<00:01:41.790> but<00:01:42.270> it<00:01:42.780> was<00:01:42.899> a<00:01:42.930> nice

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
need for a lion doctor but it was a nice
