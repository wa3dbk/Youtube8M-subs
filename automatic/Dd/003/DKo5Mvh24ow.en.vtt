00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:16.489 
if you really like messages it's worth

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:20.350 
if you really like messages it's worth
the<00:02:16.730> 799<00:02:17.650> but<00:02:18.650> if<00:02:18.800> you<00:02:18.950> can<00:02:19.640> just<00:02:19.880> wait<00:02:20.090> and

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
the 799 but if you can just wait and

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.270 
the 799 but if you can just wait and
you're<00:02:20.480> more<00:02:20.870> of<00:02:20.930> a<00:02:21.020> bite<00:02:21.260> SMS<00:02:21.650> person<00:02:22.010> going

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:23.989 
to get bite SMS I think that's a little

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:25.120 
to get bite SMS I think that's a little
bit<00:02:24.200> more<00:02:24.319> in<00:02:24.410> depth<00:02:24.620> but<00:02:24.860> if<00:02:24.950> you<00:02:25.010> like

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.130 
bit more in depth but if you like

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:27.339 
bit more in depth but if you like
messages<00:02:25.610> nothing<00:02:25.819> complex<00:02:26.360> go<00:02:27.080> with

00:02:27.339 --> 00:02:27.349 
messages nothing complex go with

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:29.920 
messages nothing complex go with
messages<00:02:28.130> plus<00:02:28.370> so<00:02:29.000> that<00:02:29.599> is<00:02:29.720> going<00:02:29.840> to<00:02:29.900> wrap

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
messages plus so that is going to wrap

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:31.449
