you<00:01:10.799> want<00:01:11.490> to<00:01:11.520> use<00:01:11.580> a<00:01:11.670> trampoline<00:01:12.299> for

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
you want to use a trampoline for

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.200 
you want to use a trampoline for
exercise<00:01:13.340> I'd<00:01:14.340> be<00:01:14.549> using<00:01:14.820> it<00:01:14.880> for<00:01:15.030> something

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
exercise I'd be using it for something

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.870 
exercise I'd be using it for something
else<00:01:15.479> because<00:01:16.259> it's<00:01:16.680> not<00:01:16.860> really<00:01:17.340> that<00:01:17.369> good

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
else because it's not really that good

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.480 
else because it's not really that good
for<00:01:18.119> exercise<00:01:18.299> cuz<00:01:19.290> you're<00:01:19.530> kind<00:01:19.830> of<00:01:19.950> bouncing

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
for exercise cuz you're kind of bouncing

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.030 
for exercise cuz you're kind of bouncing
up<00:01:20.640> and<00:01:20.790> down<00:01:20.939> I<00:01:21.540> mean<00:01:22.200> it<00:01:22.590> would<00:01:22.799> be<00:01:22.830> better

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
up and down I mean it would be better

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.520 
up and down I mean it would be better
just<00:01:23.159> to<00:01:23.460> go<00:01:23.490> outside<00:01:24.060> and<00:01:24.360> walk<00:01:24.570> and<00:01:24.840> jog<00:01:25.080> the

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
just to go outside and walk and jog the

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.740 
just to go outside and walk and jog the
impact<00:01:25.920> of<00:01:26.250> jogging<00:01:26.759> would<00:01:27.090> tone<00:01:27.420> your<00:01:27.600> legs

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
impact of jogging would tone your legs

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.649 
impact of jogging would tone your legs
much<00:01:28.080> more<00:01:28.380> than<00:01:28.950> a<00:01:28.979> trampoline<00:01:29.700> I'm<00:01:29.970> sure

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
much more than a trampoline I'm sure

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:31.969 
much more than a trampoline I'm sure
it's<00:01:30.810> fun<00:01:31.020> and<00:01:31.229> if<00:01:31.320> you<00:01:31.409> want<00:01:31.560> to<00:01:31.650> incorporate

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
it's fun and if you want to incorporate

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.310 
it's fun and if you want to incorporate
that<00:01:32.549> in<00:01:32.820> but<00:01:33.270> I<00:01:33.299> would<00:01:33.540> not<00:01:33.659> think<00:01:34.020> of<00:01:34.079> it<00:01:34.170> as

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
that in but I would not think of it as

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.190 
that in but I would not think of it as
weight<00:01:34.799> training<00:01:35.159> or<00:01:35.369> weight<00:01:35.850> loss<00:01:36.200> again

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.230 
if you like that and then simple basic
easy<00:01:51.810> weight<00:01:52.560> training<00:01:52.890> it's<00:01:53.610> the<00:01:53.880> three

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
easy weight training it's the three

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.690 
easy weight training it's the three
they're<00:01:54.810> not<00:01:54.960> fun<00:01:55.290> but<00:01:55.920> they<00:01:56.070> do<00:01:56.130> work<00:01:56.430> magic

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
they're not fun but they do work magic

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.630 
they're not fun but they do work magic
if<00:01:57.090> you<00:01:57.180> do<00:01:57.329> them<00:01:57.479> consistently<00:01:58.020> enough<00:01:58.640> now

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
if you do them consistently enough now

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.510 
if you do them consistently enough now
your<00:01:59.850> third<00:02:00.119> question<00:02:00.329> is<00:02:00.719> about<00:02:00.840> liposuction

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 
your third question is about liposuction

your third question is about liposuction
what<00:02:02.520> are<00:02:02.640> my<00:02:02.790> thoughts<00:02:03.060> on<00:02:03.390> liposuction<00:02:04.350> well

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
what are my thoughts on liposuction well

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.389 
what are my thoughts on liposuction well
this<00:02:05.610> is<00:02:05.790> really<00:02:06.000> what<00:02:06.590> liposuction<00:02:07.590> surgeons

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
this is really what liposuction surgeons

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.790 
this is really what liposuction surgeons
or<00:02:08.729> plastic<00:02:09.300> surgeons<00:02:09.780> should<00:02:09.989> be<00:02:10.410> telling

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
or plastic surgeons should be telling

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.589 
or plastic surgeons should be telling
you<00:02:10.979> before<00:02:11.640> they<00:02:11.760> think<00:02:11.940> about<00:02:12.120> taking<00:02:12.330> your

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
you before they think about taking your

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.740 
you before they think about taking your
money

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
money

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:17.350

number of fat cells in our body they
occur<00:02:20.330> when<00:02:20.510> you're<00:02:20.630> young<00:02:21.230> and<00:02:21.530> typically<00:02:22.370> we

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:22.490 
occur when you're young and typically we

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:24.640 
occur when you're young and typically we
keep<00:02:22.760> the<00:02:22.910> same<00:02:23.120> amount<00:02:23.150> now<00:02:23.660> we<00:02:24.350> can<00:02:24.500> make

those fat cells smaller they can even

those fat cells smaller they can even
disappear<00:02:27.110> if<00:02:27.290> we<00:02:27.440> diet<00:02:27.650> well<00:02:28.520> enough<00:02:28.820> and<00:02:29.750> if

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
and and split into two but here's what

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:38.740 
and and split into two but here's what
you<00:02:37.280> have<00:02:37.550> to<00:02:37.730> remember<00:02:38.030> let<00:02:38.360> me<00:02:38.420> give<00:02:38.570> you<00:02:38.660> an

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
you have to remember let me give you an

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:41.890 
you have to remember let me give you an
analogy<00:02:39.200> let's<00:02:40.070> say<00:02:40.250> you<00:02:40.310> had<00:02:40.550> a<00:02:40.580> table<00:02:41.180> it<00:02:41.780> was

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
analogy let's say you had a table it was

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.800 
analogy let's say you had a table it was
a<00:02:41.960> big<00:02:42.170> table<00:02:42.410> and<00:02:42.800> on<00:02:43.280> that<00:02:43.460> table<00:02:43.730> you<00:02:44.420> spread

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
a big table and on that table you spread

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.230 
a big table and on that table you spread
out<00:02:44.840> a<00:02:44.960> bunch<00:02:45.200> of<00:02:45.350> books<00:02:45.790> because<00:02:46.790> the<00:02:46.940> table

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:47.240 
out a bunch of books because the table

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:49.840 
out a bunch of books because the table
is<00:02:47.330> relatively<00:02:47.750> big<00:02:48.110> your<00:02:48.710> thickness<00:02:49.670> of

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:49.850 
is relatively big your thickness of

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:52.150 
is relatively big your thickness of
books<00:02:50.180> would<00:02:50.450> be<00:02:50.480> relatively<00:02:51.170> thin<00:02:51.680> because

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
books would be relatively thin because

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.100 
books would be relatively thin because
the<00:02:52.730> books<00:02:52.970> can<00:02:53.180> be<00:02:53.300> spread<00:02:53.570> out<00:02:53.720> all<00:02:53.870> over<00:02:53.900> a

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 
the books can be spread out all over a

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:56.350 
the books can be spread out all over a
big<00:02:54.350> table<00:02:54.830> now<00:02:55.370> if<00:02:55.430> you<00:02:55.550> made<00:02:55.700> that<00:02:55.730> table

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:56.360 
big table now if you made that table

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.720 
big table now if you made that table
smaller<00:02:56.810> but<00:02:57.770> you<00:02:57.860> have<00:02:58.010> the<00:02:58.130> same<00:02:58.370> amount<00:02:58.580> of

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
smaller but you have the same amount of

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:01.690 
smaller but you have the same amount of
books<00:02:59.000> the<00:02:59.930> thickness<00:03:00.620> of<00:03:00.770> the<00:03:00.980> books<00:03:01.250> would

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 
books the thickness of the books would

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.760 
books the thickness of the books would
then<00:03:01.880> get<00:03:02.090> greater<00:03:02.480> because<00:03:02.900> the<00:03:03.140> table<00:03:03.620> to

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:03.770 
then get greater because the table to

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:06.010 
then get greater because the table to
spread<00:03:04.070> them<00:03:04.190> out<00:03:04.310> over<00:03:04.370> was<00:03:05.180> smaller<00:03:05.540> and

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:06.020 
spread them out over was smaller and

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:08.140 
spread them out over was smaller and
that's<00:03:06.800> the<00:03:06.980> way<00:03:07.100> fat<00:03:07.340> cells<00:03:07.640> work<00:03:07.910> with

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
that's the way fat cells work with

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:11.110 
that's the way fat cells work with
liposuction<00:03:08.300> if<00:03:09.140> you<00:03:09.890> have<00:03:10.070> liposuction<00:03:10.280> and

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
liposuction if you have liposuction and

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.030 
liposuction if you have liposuction and
you<00:03:11.480> don't<00:03:11.750> decrease<00:03:12.200> your<00:03:12.440> calorie<00:03:12.830> intake

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 
you don't decrease your calorie intake

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:16.570 
you don't decrease your calorie intake
now<00:03:13.520> you<00:03:13.580> have<00:03:13.880> fewer<00:03:14.360> fat<00:03:14.840> cells<00:03:15.320> to<00:03:15.770> spread

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:16.580 
now you have fewer fat cells to spread

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:19.060 
now you have fewer fat cells to spread
those<00:03:16.730> calories<00:03:17.120> over<00:03:17.780> so<00:03:18.620> now<00:03:18.770> you're<00:03:18.920> gonna

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:19.070 
those calories over so now you're gonna

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:22.240 
those calories over so now you're gonna
get<00:03:19.340> greater<00:03:19.790> fat<00:03:20.270> accumulation<00:03:20.959> in<00:03:21.380> the<00:03:21.860> fat

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.250 
get greater fat accumulation in the fat

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:24.340 
get greater fat accumulation in the fat
areas<00:03:22.700> or<00:03:22.940> the<00:03:23.120> fat<00:03:23.360> cells<00:03:23.720> that<00:03:24.200> are

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:24.350 
areas or the fat cells that are

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:26.830 
areas or the fat cells that are
remaining<00:03:24.820> so<00:03:25.820> I've<00:03:25.940> seen<00:03:26.180> this<00:03:26.330> a<00:03:26.390> million

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 
remaining so I've seen this a million

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.980 
remaining so I've seen this a million
times<00:03:27.190> women<00:03:28.190> have<00:03:28.520> their<00:03:28.700> hips<00:03:29.120> and<00:03:29.480> and<00:03:29.780> rear

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:29.990 
times women have their hips and and rear

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:31.540 
times women have their hips and and rear
end<00:03:30.170> liposuction<00:03:31.100> in<00:03:31.220> their<00:03:31.340> waist

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:31.550 
end liposuction in their waist

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:34.030 
end liposuction in their waist
liposuction<00:03:32.209> and<00:03:32.330> they<00:03:32.480> look<00:03:32.690> great<00:03:32.900> but<00:03:33.290> then

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040 
liposuction and they look great but then

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:36.220 
liposuction and they look great but then
they<00:03:34.130> don't<00:03:34.310> alter<00:03:34.700> their<00:03:34.850> eating<00:03:35.060> now<00:03:35.959> pretty

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.230 
they don't alter their eating now pretty

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:39.790 
they don't alter their eating now pretty
soon<00:03:36.320> they<00:03:37.190> end<00:03:37.459> up<00:03:37.580> having<00:03:37.850> a<00:03:38.330> fatter<00:03:38.990> face<00:03:39.440> or

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:39.800 
soon they end up having a fatter face or

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:41.710 
soon they end up having a fatter face or
then<00:03:39.920> getting<00:03:40.340> fat<00:03:40.670> on<00:03:40.910> their<00:03:41.150> backs<00:03:41.390> and

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:41.720 
then getting fat on their backs and

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.870 
then getting fat on their backs and
things<00:03:41.959> like<00:03:42.140> that<00:03:42.410> because<00:03:43.160> there's<00:03:43.580> less

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:43.880 
things like that because there's less

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:46.600 
things like that because there's less
fat<00:03:44.270> cells<00:03:44.660> than<00:03:44.900> the<00:03:45.020> legs<00:03:45.230> to<00:03:46.010> store<00:03:46.370> those

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:46.610 
fat cells than the legs to store those
