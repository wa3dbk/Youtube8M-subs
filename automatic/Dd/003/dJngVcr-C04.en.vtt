learn about two terminals here Oh
actually<00:00:17.699> one<00:00:17.970> terminal<00:00:18.180> it's<00:00:18.510> hyper<00:00:18.930> compte

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
actually one terminal it's hyper compte

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.529 
actually one terminal it's hyper compte
seven-plus<00:00:19.850> we're<00:00:20.850> gonna<00:00:20.970> use<00:00:21.180> what's<00:00:21.480> called

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
seven-plus we're gonna use what's called

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.060 
seven-plus we're gonna use what's called
a<00:00:21.720> fast<00:00:21.990> local<00:00:22.289> cable<00:00:22.500> which<00:00:22.590> is<00:00:22.619> this<00:00:22.859> right

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
a fast local cable which is this right

a fast local cable which is this right
here<00:00:23.310> you<00:00:23.850> plug<00:00:24.029> it<00:00:24.180> into<00:00:24.529> to<00:00:25.529> the<00:00:25.619> pin<00:00:25.769> port

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:28.010 
here you plug it into to the pin port

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
one that we're going to download today

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.329 
one that we're going to download today
so<00:01:03.420> in<00:01:03.930> order<00:01:04.170> to<00:01:04.290> get<00:01:04.439> the<00:01:04.530> process<00:01:04.920> started

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
so in order to get the process started

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.950 
so in order to get the process started
we're<00:01:06.119> gonna<00:01:06.210> hit<00:01:06.450> function<00:01:08.510> 96:1<00:01:09.510> the<00:01:09.630> master

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
we're gonna hit function 96:1 the master

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.380 
we're gonna hit function 96:1 the master
terminal<00:01:10.290> here<00:01:10.500> and<00:01:11.310> puts<00:01:11.549> it<00:01:11.640> into<00:01:11.790> a<00:01:11.939> send

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
terminal here and puts it into a send

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.359 
terminal here and puts it into a send
mode<00:01:12.570> and<00:01:13.020> we're<00:01:13.229> gonna<00:01:13.350> select<00:01:13.560> one<00:01:13.710> because

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
mode and we're gonna select one because

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.539 
mode and we're gonna select one because
it's<00:01:14.640> sending<00:01:15.299> through<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:15.659> pin<00:01:15.810> pad<00:01:16.549> and

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
it's sending through the pin pad and

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.820 
it's sending through the pin pad and
then<00:01:18.299> we're<00:01:18.420> gonna<00:01:18.540> get<00:01:18.689> to<00:01:18.810> a<00:01:18.840> speed<00:01:19.619> page

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
then we're gonna get to a speed page

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:20.359 
then we're gonna get to a speed page
here

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
here

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.390 
here
we<00:01:20.610> always<00:01:20.729> start<00:01:20.970> off<00:01:21.119> with<00:01:21.299> the<00:01:21.390> fastest<00:01:22.400> if

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
we always start off with the fastest if

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.679 
we always start off with the fastest if
for<00:01:23.670> some<00:01:23.700> reason<00:01:24.119> you<00:01:24.180> get<00:01:24.270> an<00:01:24.390> error<00:01:24.630> message

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
for some reason you get an error message

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.660 
for some reason you get an error message
you<00:01:24.990> can<00:01:25.200> always<00:01:25.470> a<00:01:25.650> bump<00:01:25.890> that<00:01:26.009> down<00:01:26.070> to<00:01:26.580> this

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
you can always a bump that down to this

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.719 
you can always a bump that down to this
little<00:01:26.970> to<00:01:27.210> the<00:01:27.330> slower<00:01:27.540> speeds<00:01:27.869> here<00:01:28.610> so<00:01:29.610> that

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
little to the slower speeds here so that

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.999 
little to the slower speeds here so that
one<00:01:29.850> is<00:01:29.880> in<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.360> send<00:01:30.600> mode<00:01:30.750> right<00:01:30.930> now<00:01:30.990> all<00:01:31.799> we

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
one is in the send mode right now all we

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.010 
one is in the send mode right now all we
have<00:01:32.130> to<00:01:32.220> do<00:01:32.310> is<00:01:32.430> just<00:01:32.640> press<00:01:32.790> Start<00:01:33.180> to<00:01:33.540> begin

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
have to do is just press Start to begin

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.539 
have to do is just press Start to begin
that<00:01:34.380> but<00:01:34.619> we<00:01:34.710> need<00:01:34.860> to<00:01:34.950> get<00:01:35.040> this<00:01:35.189> one<00:01:35.340> into

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
that but we need to get this one into

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.819 
that but we need to get this one into
the<00:01:35.640> receive<00:01:35.939> mode<00:01:36.180> so<00:01:37.020> we<00:01:37.290> are<00:01:37.409> going<00:01:37.590> to<00:01:37.680> hit

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
the receive mode so we are going to hit

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.230 
the receive mode so we are going to hit
function<00:01:38.119> 97

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
function 97

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.560 
function 97
as<00:01:39.860> you<00:01:40.860> can<00:01:40.950> see<00:01:41.130> program<00:01:41.820> receive<00:01:42.150> we're

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
as you can see program receive we're

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.800 
as you can see program receive we're
gonna<00:01:42.659> select<00:01:42.840> one<00:01:42.960> for<00:01:43.259> pin<00:01:43.439> pad<00:01:44.000> 3<00:01:45.000> it's<00:01:45.630> very

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
gonna select one for pin pad 3 it's very

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.330 
gonna select one for pin pad 3 it's very
important<00:01:46.140> that<00:01:46.229> you<00:01:46.380> select<00:01:46.590> the<00:01:46.770> same<00:01:47.009> exact

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
important that you select the same exact

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.609 
important that you select the same exact
speed<00:01:47.640> both<00:01:48.210> of<00:01:48.299> them<00:01:48.420> have<00:01:48.630> to<00:01:48.780> be<00:01:48.810> identical

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
speed both of them have to be identical

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.190 
speed both of them have to be identical
so<00:01:49.799> this<00:01:50.430> one<00:01:50.610> is<00:01:50.729> in<00:01:50.759> the<00:01:50.850> receive<00:01:51.299> mode<00:01:51.540> all

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
so this one is in the receive mode all

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.190 
so this one is in the receive mode all
we<00:01:52.409> do<00:01:52.560> is<00:01:52.680> come<00:01:52.829> over<00:01:52.920> here<00:01:53.340> and<00:01:53.720> press<00:01:54.720> ENTER

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
it's gonna issue that initializing these

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:43.130 
it's gonna issue that initializing these
terminals<00:02:42.240> takes<00:02:42.450> about<00:02:42.570> a<00:02:42.720> minute<00:02:43.020> and<00:02:43.080> a

terminals takes about a minute and a

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.170 
terminals takes about a minute and a
half<00:02:43.580> but<00:02:44.580> that's<00:02:44.670> it

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
half but that's it

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.960

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
once this initializes the processes is

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.240 
once this initializes the processes is
complete<00:02:48.510> and<00:02:48.930> you're<00:02:49.290> ready<00:02:49.440> to<00:02:49.620> go<00:02:49.800> you<00:02:50.130> know

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
do is just press initialize on each

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.010 
do is just press initialize on each
terminal<00:02:58.740> that's<00:02:59.070> a<00:02:59.190> great<00:02:59.340> thing<00:02:59.520> about<00:02:59.640> it

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:00.020

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
as you can see transaction complete its

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.940 
as you can see transaction complete its
condition<00:03:03.780> tables<00:03:05.810> and<00:03:06.810> now<00:03:07.530> we're<00:03:07.650> ready<00:03:07.800> to

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
condition tables and now we're ready to

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:09.280 
condition tables and now we're ready to
go
