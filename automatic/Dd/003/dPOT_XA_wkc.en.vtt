one end the converse happened at the
other<00:00:41.610> well<00:00:42.120> I<00:00:42.149> think<00:00:42.300> would<00:00:42.570> you<00:00:42.660> look<00:00:42.809> back

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
on the game Jim I think you can say

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.880 
on the game Jim I think you can say
Byron<00:00:45.510> were<00:00:45.629> the<00:00:45.750> better<00:00:45.960> side<00:00:46.200> in<00:00:46.410> possession

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
Byron were the better side in possession

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.459 
Byron were the better side in possession
but<00:00:47.539> Borussia<00:00:48.539> Dortmund<00:00:48.989> would<00:00:49.140> setter<00:00:49.379> that

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
but Borussia Dortmund would setter that

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.260 
but Borussia Dortmund would setter that
certainly<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.219> better<00:00:50.370> side<00:00:50.730> in<00:00:50.940> their

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
certainly the better side in their

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.000 
certainly the better side in their
finishing<00:00:51.690> and<00:00:51.960> certainly<00:00:52.440> their<00:00:52.559> breaking

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
finishing and certainly their breaking

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.770 
finishing and certainly their breaking
power<00:00:53.250> and<00:00:53.460> just<00:00:53.940> when<00:00:54.059> you<00:00:54.149> were<00:00:54.270> expecting

power and just when you were expecting

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.410 
power and just when you were expecting
something<00:00:55.050> at<00:00:55.289> one<00:00:55.440> end<00:00:56.000> basically<00:00:57.000> Byron

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
something at one end basically Byron

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:58.849 
something at one end basically Byron
getting<00:00:57.719> back<00:00:57.899> into<00:00:58.109> it<00:00:58.320> and<00:00:58.379> maybe<00:00:58.530> taking

with<00:01:50.340> the<00:01:50.430> onset<00:01:50.790> of<00:01:50.820> the<00:01:50.970> Bundesliga

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
with the onset of the Bundesliga

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.240 
with the onset of the Bundesliga
campaign<00:01:51.720> and<00:01:52.259> just<00:01:52.500> see<00:01:52.619> if<00:01:52.649> a<00:01:52.890> pattern

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
campaign and just see if a pattern

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.870 
campaign and just see if a pattern
develops<00:01:53.729> because<00:01:54.180> then<00:01:54.630> I<00:01:54.659> think

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:55.880 
develops because then I think

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.520 
develops because then I think
yeah<00:01:56.300> one<00:01:56.510> or<00:01:56.630> two<00:01:56.780> people<00:01:56.990> might<00:01:57.290> raise

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.530 
yeah one or two people might raise

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:58.990 
yeah one or two people might raise
eyebrows<00:01:58.010> about<00:01:58.250> the<00:01:58.400> way<00:01:58.520> he's<00:01:58.729> kind<00:01:58.940> of

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000 
eyebrows about the way he's kind of

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.910 
eyebrows about the way he's kind of
setting<00:01:59.300> aside<00:01:59.570> up<00:01:59.780> now<00:02:00.050> but<00:02:00.290> remember<00:02:00.440> we're

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:00.920 
setting aside up now but remember we're

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.410 
setting aside up now but remember we're
in<00:02:00.950> pre-season<00:02:01.490> it's<00:02:01.850> still<00:02:02.030> very<00:02:02.330> early

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 
in pre-season it's still very early

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.360 
in pre-season it's still very early
players<00:02:03.260> are<00:02:03.470> getting<00:02:03.740> their<00:02:03.860> fitness<00:02:04.220> and

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:04.370 
players are getting their fitness and

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:06.210 
players are getting their fitness and
one<00:02:04.490> or<00:02:04.610> two<00:02:04.760> are<00:02:04.910> still<00:02:05.120> carrying<00:02:05.510> Knox<00:02:05.810> and

one or two are still carrying Knox and

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:08.380 
one or two are still carrying Knox and
schweinsteiger<00:02:07.220> has<00:02:07.340> had<00:02:07.460> an<00:02:07.580> operation<00:02:07.970> so

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
schweinsteiger has had an operation so

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:10.570 
schweinsteiger has had an operation so
you<00:02:08.600> can't<00:02:09.380> really<00:02:09.619> judge<00:02:09.950> them<00:02:10.100> too<00:02:10.310> harshly

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580 
you can't really judge them too harshly

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.150 
you can't really judge them too harshly
as<00:02:10.910> yet<00:02:11.150> if<00:02:11.360> things<00:02:12.140> carry<00:02:12.470> on<00:02:12.709> like<00:02:12.920> this<00:02:13.100> and

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
as yet if things carry on like this and

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.850 
as yet if things carry on like this and
they<00:02:13.430> look<00:02:13.580> a<00:02:13.700> little<00:02:13.940> vulnerable<00:02:14.860> maybe

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
they look a little vulnerable maybe

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.440 
they look a little vulnerable maybe
three<00:02:16.160> or<00:02:16.190> four<00:02:16.310> weeks<00:02:16.640> into<00:02:16.910> the<00:02:17.000> campaign

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
three or four weeks into the campaign

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.199 
three or four weeks into the campaign
then<00:02:18.020> of<00:02:18.170> course<00:02:18.440> the<00:02:18.740> scrutiny<00:02:19.250> will<00:02:19.459> will

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:20.209 
then of course the scrutiny will will

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:22.030 
then of course the scrutiny will will
result<00:02:20.570> in<00:02:20.750> probably<00:02:21.080> criticism<00:02:21.650> you<00:02:21.800> know<00:02:21.830> if

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
result in probably criticism you know if

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.120 
result in probably criticism you know if
that<00:02:22.670> is<00:02:22.790> the<00:02:22.910> case<00:02:23.290> but<00:02:24.290> listen<00:02:24.709> he's<00:02:24.920> been

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.130 
that is the case but listen he's been

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:27.250 
that is the case but listen he's been
there<00:02:25.340> and<00:02:25.490> done<00:02:25.550> it<00:02:25.670> before<00:02:26.150> he's<00:02:26.360> had<00:02:26.390> he's

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
there and done it before he's had he's

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:28.840 
there and done it before he's had he's
been<00:02:27.470> wounded<00:02:27.620> the<00:02:27.950> biggest<00:02:28.250> of<00:02:28.400> clubs<00:02:28.610> in<00:02:28.790> the

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:28.850 
been wounded the biggest of clubs in the

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:30.880 
been wounded the biggest of clubs in the
world<00:02:29.060> in<00:02:29.270> Barcelona<00:02:29.780> he's<00:02:30.020> won<00:02:30.230> the<00:02:30.350> lot<00:02:30.530> so

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
world in Barcelona he's won the lot so

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:32.830 
world in Barcelona he's won the lot so
I'm<00:02:31.670> sure<00:02:31.940> he'll<00:02:32.090> take<00:02:32.300> it<00:02:32.360> all<00:02:32.570> in<00:02:32.750> your

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
I'm sure he'll take it all in your

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:34.270 
I'm sure he'll take it all in your
stride<00:02:33.140> but<00:02:33.350> we'll<00:02:33.500> just<00:02:33.530> have<00:02:33.800> to<00:02:33.830> wait<00:02:34.070> and

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
stride but we'll just have to wait and

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.220 
stride but we'll just have to wait and
see<00:02:34.430> how<00:02:34.640> that<00:02:34.820> develops<00:02:34.970> in<00:02:35.450> in<00:02:35.870> a<00:02:35.989> slightly

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
see how that develops in in a slightly

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.020 
see how that develops in in a slightly
longer<00:02:36.560> term<00:02:36.890> there<00:02:37.250> has<00:02:37.370> been<00:02:37.580> a<00:02:37.670> successful

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
longer term there has been a successful

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:39.699 
longer term there has been a successful
preseason<00:02:38.570> campaign<00:02:39.080> with<00:02:39.260> nine<00:02:39.440> straight

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:39.709 
preseason campaign with nine straight

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:41.410 
preseason campaign with nine straight
wins<00:02:39.950> before<00:02:40.130> that<00:02:40.400> a<00:02:40.489> more<00:02:40.700> than<00:02:40.760> 60<00:02:41.180> goals

and<00:02:41.630> only<00:02:41.780> three<00:02:42.050> conceded<00:02:42.620> will<00:02:43.220> he<00:02:43.280> be

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
and only three conceded will he be

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.780 
and only three conceded will he be
concerned<00:02:44.500> with<00:02:45.500> many<00:02:45.860> aspects<00:02:46.400> of<00:02:46.459> what<00:02:46.670> he's

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
concerned with many aspects of what he's

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:48.729 
concerned with many aspects of what he's
seen<00:02:46.970> tonight<00:02:47.209> all<00:02:47.600> or<00:02:47.900> will<00:02:48.170> he<00:02:48.230> just<00:02:48.260> be<00:02:48.590> able

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:48.739 
seen tonight all or will he just be able

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:52.449 
seen tonight all or will he just be able
to<00:02:48.920> bat<00:02:49.130> it<00:02:49.280> off<00:02:49.400> do<00:02:49.550> you<00:02:49.640> think<00:02:49.900> well<00:02:51.459> yeah

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:52.459 
to bat it off do you think well yeah

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:55.229 
to bat it off do you think well yeah
some<00:02:52.850> of<00:02:52.880> it<00:02:53.120> you<00:02:53.300> put<00:02:53.570> down<00:02:53.780> to<00:02:53.989> the<00:02:54.110> fact<00:02:54.320> that

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:55.239 
some of it you put down to the fact that

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:57.759 
some of it you put down to the fact that
maybe<00:02:56.239> what<00:02:56.510> they've<00:02:56.660> done<00:02:56.840> up<00:02:57.019> to<00:02:57.200> now<00:02:57.380> in

00:02:57.759 --> 00:02:57.769 
maybe what they've done up to now in

00:02:57.769 --> 00:02:59.470 
maybe what they've done up to now in
pre-season<00:02:58.160> is<00:02:58.430> chin<00:02:58.610> and<00:02:58.760> masked<00:02:59.090> coming<00:02:59.390> up

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 
pre-season is chin and masked coming up

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.940 
pre-season is chin and masked coming up
against<00:02:59.810> this<00:02:59.900> level<00:03:00.260> of<00:03:00.350> opposition

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
against this level of opposition

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:03.890 
against this level of opposition
but<00:03:02.550> I<00:03:02.760> think<00:03:03.090> there<00:03:03.209> will<00:03:03.330> be<00:03:03.390> aspects

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
but I think there will be aspects

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.630 
but I think there will be aspects
they'll<00:03:04.050> be<00:03:04.170> upset<00:03:04.319> about<00:03:04.500> we<00:03:04.800> Psalm<00:03:05.040> animated

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
they'll be upset about we Psalm animated

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.040 
they'll be upset about we Psalm animated
at<00:03:05.730> times<00:03:05.970> on<00:03:06.180> the<00:03:06.269> touchline<00:03:06.480> and<00:03:06.930> I

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.050 
at times on the touchline and I

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:08.330 
at times on the touchline and I
certainly<00:03:07.319> thought<00:03:07.590> the<00:03:07.739> first<00:03:07.980> off<00:03:08.190> he

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
certainly thought the first off he

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:09.830 
certainly thought the first off he
wasn't<00:03:08.640> happy<00:03:08.760> with<00:03:09.000> the<00:03:09.090> work<00:03:09.239> rape<00:03:09.510> from<00:03:09.720> his

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
wasn't happy with the work rape from his

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.040 
wasn't happy with the work rape from his
team<00:03:09.989> and<00:03:10.440> getting<00:03:10.680> behind<00:03:11.040> the<00:03:11.160> ball<00:03:11.340> when

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:12.050 
team and getting behind the ball when

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:14.180 
team and getting behind the ball when
Bruce<00:03:13.050> Lee<00:03:13.170> Dawon<00:03:13.349> looked<00:03:13.680> to<00:03:13.769> get<00:03:13.920> off<00:03:14.010> to<00:03:14.160> a

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
Bruce Lee Dawon looked to get off to a

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:17.449 
Bruce Lee Dawon looked to get off to a
better<00:03:14.370> start<00:03:15.290> and<00:03:16.290> yeah<00:03:16.709> as<00:03:16.860> the<00:03:17.160> game

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 
better start and yeah as the game

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:20.360 
better start and yeah as the game
progressed<00:03:17.940> I<00:03:18.239> think<00:03:18.709> one<00:03:19.709> or<00:03:19.860> two<00:03:19.980> things<00:03:20.190> he

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
progressed I think one or two things he

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:21.740 
progressed I think one or two things he
would<00:03:20.519> have<00:03:20.610> liked<00:03:20.849> but<00:03:20.970> certainly<00:03:21.450> some<00:03:21.720> of

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
would have liked but certainly some of

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.660 
would have liked but certainly some of
the<00:03:21.840> defendant<00:03:22.380> and<00:03:22.500> his<00:03:22.560> side<00:03:22.800> he'll<00:03:23.400> be<00:03:23.519> very

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
the defendant and his side he'll be very

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:24.380 
the defendant and his side he'll be very
disappointed

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
disappointed

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:26.990 
disappointed
particularly<00:03:25.140> Tom<00:03:25.739> starka<00:03:26.280> filling<00:03:26.670> in<00:03:26.790> for

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
particularly Tom starka filling in for

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.150 
particularly Tom starka filling in for
Manuel<00:03:27.209> Neuer<00:03:27.540> who<00:03:28.080> got<00:03:28.380> him<00:03:28.500> off<00:03:28.620> to<00:03:28.769> the<00:03:28.890> the

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
Manuel Neuer who got him off to the the

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.720 
Manuel Neuer who got him off to the the
worst<00:03:29.370> possible<00:03:29.959> beginning<00:03:30.959> this<00:03:31.349> evening<00:03:31.769> so

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
worst possible beginning this evening so

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:34.220 
worst possible beginning this evening so
yeah<00:03:32.910> I<00:03:32.940> think<00:03:33.090> it's<00:03:33.330> a<00:03:33.390> mixture<00:03:33.660> for<00:03:33.900> him<00:03:34.019> to

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
yeah I think it's a mixture for him to

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:37.280 
yeah I think it's a mixture for him to
assess<00:03:34.890> tonight<00:03:35.700> and<00:03:36.150> yet<00:03:36.299> at<00:03:36.420> three<00:03:36.720> two<00:03:36.989> with

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
assess tonight and yet at three two with

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:39.830 
assess tonight and yet at three two with
the<00:03:37.590> ten<00:03:37.860> minutes<00:03:38.130> to<00:03:38.250> go<00:03:38.430> you<00:03:39.269> probably<00:03:39.540> if

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
the ten minutes to go you probably if

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.720 
the ten minutes to go you probably if
you're<00:03:39.989> betting<00:03:40.170> either<00:03:40.440> way<00:03:40.680> you<00:03:40.739> may<00:03:41.489> well

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
you're betting either way you may well

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:42.800 
you're betting either way you may well
have<00:03:41.880> gone<00:03:42.030> for<00:03:42.209> by<00:03:42.329> they<00:03:42.510> get<00:03:42.630> themselves

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
have gone for by they get themselves

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:44.449 
have gone for by they get themselves
back<00:03:43.260> into<00:03:43.470> it<00:03:43.620> and<00:03:43.739> at<00:03:43.799> least<00:03:43.950> take<00:03:44.190> the<00:03:44.340> game

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
back into it and at least take the game

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:46.130 
back into it and at least take the game
to<00:03:44.579> penalties<00:03:45.000> at<00:03:45.120> three<00:03:45.329> three<00:03:45.569> well<00:03:45.870> I<00:03:45.900> was

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:46.140 
to penalties at three three well I was

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:47.870 
to penalties at three three well I was
certainly<00:03:46.440> thinking<00:03:46.799> that<00:03:46.950> way<00:03:47.099> I<00:03:47.130> thought

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:47.880 
certainly thinking that way I thought

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:50.030 
certainly thinking that way I thought
Byron<00:03:48.360> had<00:03:48.569> the<00:03:48.750> momentum<00:03:49.230> then<00:03:49.410> and<00:03:49.620> Robin

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
Byron had the momentum then and Robin

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.830 
Byron had the momentum then and Robin
scored<00:03:50.430> a<00:03:50.519> beautiful<00:03:50.730> second<00:03:51.420> goal<00:03:51.569> with<00:03:51.750> the

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
scored a beautiful second goal with the

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.690 
scored a beautiful second goal with the
turn<00:03:52.049> and<00:03:52.290> I'm<00:03:52.709> thinking<00:03:53.040> yeah<00:03:53.190> they<00:03:53.340> can<00:03:53.489> take

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
turn and I'm thinking yeah they can take

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:56.210 
turn and I'm thinking yeah they can take
it<00:03:53.849> on<00:03:54.000> now<00:03:54.209> and<00:03:54.390> a<00:03:55.110> little<00:03:55.590> surprised<00:03:55.950> with

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 
it on now and a little surprised with

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:57.530 
it on now and a little surprised with
the<00:03:56.280> change<00:03:56.549> he<00:03:56.730> made<00:03:56.760> I<00:03:56.940> thought<00:03:57.239> he<00:03:57.420> was

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
the change he made I thought he was

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:58.940 
the change he made I thought he was
worried<00:03:57.870> about<00:03:57.959> getting<00:03:58.260> hit<00:03:58.590> by<00:03:58.739> another

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950 
worried about getting hit by another

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:00.890 
worried about getting hit by another
counter<00:03:59.489> from<00:03:59.819> brisee<00:04:00.120> Dorman<00:04:00.510> when<00:04:00.660> I<00:04:00.690> saw

counter from brisee Dorman when I saw

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:02.569

Dante<00:04:01.200> come<00:04:01.530> on<00:04:01.680> I<00:04:01.829> thought<00:04:02.190> well<00:04:02.340> he's<00:04:02.430> sure

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:02.579 
Dante come on I thought well he's sure

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:04.520 
Dante come on I thought well he's sure
to<00:04:02.610> go<00:04:02.910> center<00:04:03.329> back<00:04:03.510> and<00:04:03.750> of<00:04:04.049> course<00:04:04.200> he<00:04:04.319> ends

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
to go center back and of course he ends

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:06.890 
to go center back and of course he ends
up<00:04:04.590> at<00:04:04.769> center<00:04:05.040> forward<00:04:05.430> and<00:04:05.900> ambrosia

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 
up at center forward and ambrosia

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.420 
up at center forward and ambrosia
Dortmund<00:04:07.230> do<00:04:07.410> go<00:04:07.560> on<00:04:07.680> to<00:04:07.829> get<00:04:07.950> their<00:04:08.100> forward

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.430 
Dortmund do go on to get their forward

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:10.460 
Dortmund do go on to get their forward
so<00:04:08.609> that<00:04:09.150> was<00:04:09.269> a<00:04:09.299> little<00:04:09.510> strange<00:04:09.690> but<00:04:10.200> I<00:04:10.260> can

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
so that was a little strange but I can

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:12.289 
so that was a little strange but I can
understand<00:04:10.920> at<00:04:11.069> the<00:04:11.160> same<00:04:11.370> time<00:04:11.639> when<00:04:11.880> he<00:04:11.970> he

00:04:12.289 --> 00:04:12.299 
understand at the same time when he he

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:13.819 
understand at the same time when he he
throws<00:04:12.569> a<00:04:12.600> big<00:04:12.840> man<00:04:13.049> up<00:04:13.200> there<00:04:13.380> trying<00:04:13.650> to<00:04:13.680> get

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:13.829 
throws a big man up there trying to get

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:15.590 
throws a big man up there trying to get
balls<00:04:14.069> into<00:04:14.370> the<00:04:14.400> box<00:04:14.670> and<00:04:14.880> maybe<00:04:15.000> capitalize

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:15.600 
balls into the box and maybe capitalize

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:17.750 
balls into the box and maybe capitalize
on<00:04:15.630> it<00:04:15.930> with<00:04:16.350> Dante's<00:04:16.799> height<00:04:17.039> so<00:04:17.310> that<00:04:17.489> that's

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:17.760 
on it with Dante's height so that that's

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:20.890 
on it with Dante's height so that that's
one<00:04:17.940> that's<00:04:18.120> just<00:04:18.329> gone<00:04:18.479> against<00:04:18.870> him<00:04:19.340> yeah

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:20.900 
one that's just gone against him yeah

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:23.810 
one that's just gone against him yeah
overall<00:04:21.900> I<00:04:22.200> think<00:04:22.860> you<00:04:23.070> have<00:04:23.220> to<00:04:23.370> also<00:04:23.520> weigh

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:23.820 
overall I think you have to also weigh

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:25.850 
overall I think you have to also weigh
up<00:04:23.940> the<00:04:23.970> fact<00:04:24.330> that<00:04:24.419> it<00:04:24.750> is<00:04:25.260> in<00:04:25.410> Dortmund

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
up the fact that it is in Dortmund

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:27.650 
up the fact that it is in Dortmund
they're<00:04:26.400> on<00:04:26.550> their<00:04:26.729> home<00:04:26.880> turf<00:04:27.120> so<00:04:27.180> it<00:04:27.510> was

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:27.660 
they're on their home turf so it was

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:29.629 
they're on their home turf so it was
always<00:04:27.840> going<00:04:28.260> to<00:04:28.320> be<00:04:28.380> kind<00:04:28.740> of<00:04:28.800> a<00:04:28.919> tougher

00:04:29.629 --> 00:04:29.639 
always going to be kind of a tougher

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:32.150 
always going to be kind of a tougher
evening<00:04:30.030> like<00:04:30.180> that<00:04:30.419> and<00:04:30.630> I<00:04:30.750> think<00:04:31.020> club<00:04:31.470> still

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:32.160 
evening like that and I think club still

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.490 
evening like that and I think club still
has<00:04:32.460> and<00:04:33.060> he<00:04:33.210> knows<00:04:33.419> it<00:04:33.660> still<00:04:33.930> has<00:04:34.110> a<00:04:34.139> hell<00:04:34.470> of

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:34.500 
has and he knows it still has a hell of

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:37.040 
has and he knows it still has a hell of
a<00:04:34.680> side<00:04:34.919> of<00:04:34.950> this<00:04:35.190> disposal<00:04:35.820> and<00:04:35.970> once<00:04:36.840> you<00:04:36.900> get

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:37.050 
a side of this disposal and once you get

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:39.050 
a side of this disposal and once you get
to<00:04:37.169> make<00:04:37.289> Atari<00:04:37.620> and<00:04:37.830> in<00:04:37.950> play<00:04:38.160> I'm<00:04:39.000> sure

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:39.060 
to make Atari and in play I'm sure

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:40.820 
to make Atari and in play I'm sure
they'll<00:04:39.450> be<00:04:39.479> better<00:04:39.720> for<00:04:40.110> it<00:04:40.169> in<00:04:40.380> them<00:04:40.590> I

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:40.830 
they'll be better for it in them I

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:42.409 
they'll be better for it in them I
certainly<00:04:41.370> hope<00:04:41.639> that<00:04:41.669> they<00:04:41.970> get<00:04:42.150> a<00:04:42.180> lot

00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:42.419 
certainly hope that they get a lot

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:44.990 
certainly hope that they get a lot
closer<00:04:42.800> to<00:04:43.800> Bayern<00:04:44.010> Munich<00:04:44.370> and<00:04:44.490> chase<00:04:44.789> them

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:45.000 
closer to Bayern Munich and chase them

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.200 
closer to Bayern Munich and chase them
all<00:04:45.210> the<00:04:45.419> way<00:04:45.570> to<00:04:45.990> the<00:04:46.110> Bundesliga<00:04:47.090> title<00:04:48.090> this

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:48.210 
all the way to the Bundesliga title this

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:49.490 
all the way to the Bundesliga title this
time<00:04:48.270> I'm<00:04:48.510> not<00:04:48.539> saying<00:04:48.840> they're<00:04:48.960> gonna<00:04:49.080> get<00:04:49.320> it

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:49.500 
time I'm not saying they're gonna get it

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:54.540 
time I'm not saying they're gonna get it
Bayern<00:04:49.770> but<00:04:50.039> they<00:04:50.370> are<00:04:50.490> favorites<00:04:50.940> once<00:04:51.120> more
