also my next ten from off nough so
definitely<00:02:04.649> some<00:02:04.890> cool<00:02:05.159> parts<00:02:05.549> here<00:02:05.700> let's

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
definitely some cool parts here let's

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.630 
definitely some cool parts here let's
take<00:02:06.119> a<00:02:06.180> look<00:02:06.420> at<00:02:06.600> what<00:02:07.049> I<00:02:07.170> picked<00:02:07.590> up<00:02:07.740> these

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
take a look at what I picked up these

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.969 
take a look at what I picked up these
are<00:02:08.819> fresh<00:02:09.509> off<00:02:09.690> the<00:02:09.989> assembly<00:02:10.050> line<00:02:10.679> at

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
are fresh off the assembly line at

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.850 
are fresh off the assembly line at
t-bone<00:02:11.520> Racing<00:02:11.940> they<00:02:12.780> actually<00:02:13.140> just<00:02:13.500> made

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
t-bone Racing they actually just made

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:19.190 
t-bone Racing they actually just made
facture<00:02:14.280> these<00:02:14.990> in<00:02:15.990> house<00:02:16.830> and<00:02:18.020> let's<00:02:19.020> take<00:02:19.170> a

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
facture these in house and let's take a

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.700 
facture these in house and let's take a
look<00:02:19.410> so<00:02:19.830> first<00:02:19.860> thing<00:02:20.430> here<00:02:20.610> this<00:02:20.790> is<00:02:20.970> the

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:21.710 
look so first thing here this is the

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:24.230 
look so first thing here this is the
probably<00:02:22.710> the<00:02:22.890> widest<00:02:23.460> one<00:02:23.670> this<00:02:23.850> is<00:02:24.060> the

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:24.240 
probably the widest one this is the

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.840 
probably the widest one this is the
racer<00:02:24.750> three<00:02:25.260> front<00:02:25.710> bumper<00:02:26.070> and<00:02:26.550> it's

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
racer three front bumper and it's

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.660 
racer three front bumper and it's
definitely<00:02:27.780> wide<00:02:28.050> it's<00:02:28.350> going<00:02:28.500> to<00:02:28.560> cover<00:02:28.800> the

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
definitely wide it's going to cover the

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.240 
definitely wide it's going to cover the
majority<00:02:29.820> of<00:02:30.240> the<00:02:30.390> front<00:02:30.690> end<00:02:30.990> of<00:02:31.140> that<00:02:31.320> be<00:02:31.710> 44

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
majority of the front end of that be 44

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.440 
majority of the front end of that be 44
to<00:02:32.660> model<00:02:33.660> number<00:02:33.870> on<00:02:33.930> this<00:02:34.050> one<00:02:34.260> is<00:02:34.470> 11<00:02:35.040> 0<00:02:35.400> to<00:02:35.550> 7

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
to model number on this one is 11 0 to 7

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.890 
to model number on this one is 11 0 to 7
so<00:02:37.310> next<00:02:38.310> one<00:02:38.460> here<00:02:38.730> I<00:02:39.000> picked<00:02:39.510> up<00:02:39.630> three

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
so next one here I picked up three

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.600 
so next one here I picked up three
variations<00:02:40.200> I<00:02:40.590> wasn't<00:02:40.980> sure<00:02:41.130> which<00:02:41.250> one<00:02:41.459> I<00:02:41.490> was

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
variations I wasn't sure which one I was

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:45.800 
variations I wasn't sure which one I was
going<00:02:41.760> to<00:02:41.850> run<00:02:44.180> before<00:02:45.180> I<00:02:45.360> get<00:02:45.540> used<00:02:45.690> to

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
going to run before I get used to

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.770 
going to run before I get used to
driving<00:02:46.050> this<00:02:46.200> vehicle<00:02:46.380> so<00:02:46.680> next<00:02:47.400> one<00:02:47.640> 11<00:02:48.090> 0<00:02:48.510> to

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
driving this vehicle so next one 11 0 to

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.550 
driving this vehicle so next one 11 0 to
5<00:02:49.080> this<00:02:49.410> is<00:02:49.590> just<00:02:49.860> the<00:02:50.010> standard<00:02:51.110> rear<00:02:52.110> bumper

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
5 this is just the standard rear bumper

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.690 
5 this is just the standard rear bumper
for<00:02:52.980> it<00:02:53.160> this<00:02:54.000> is<00:02:55.130> pretty<00:02:56.130> much<00:02:56.250> going<00:02:56.370> to<00:02:56.580> give

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
for it this is pretty much going to give

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.880 
for it this is pretty much going to give
you<00:02:56.790> some<00:02:56.940> protection<00:02:57.090> on<00:02:57.480> the<00:02:57.600> rear<00:02:57.810> just<00:02:58.140> to

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
you some protection on the rear just to

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:00.680 
you some protection on the rear just to
make<00:02:59.040> sure<00:02:59.190> everything<00:02:59.790> goes<00:03:00.060> good<00:03:00.390> on<00:03:00.540> the

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
make sure everything goes good on the

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:05.270 
make sure everything goes good on the
track<00:03:01.640> next<00:03:02.640> one<00:03:02.910> here<00:03:03.120> this<00:03:03.270> is<00:03:03.330> a<00:03:03.630> pro<00:03:04.290> front

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
track next one here this is a pro front

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.660 
track next one here this is a pro front
bumper<00:03:05.690> this<00:03:06.690> is<00:03:06.900> very<00:03:07.410> very<00:03:08.010> minimal<00:03:08.459> this

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
bumper this is very very minimal this

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10.520 
bumper this is very very minimal this
will<00:03:08.880> give<00:03:09.060> you<00:03:09.239> just<00:03:09.480> a<00:03:09.690> little<00:03:09.989> bit<00:03:10.410> of

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
will give you just a little bit of

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.800 
will give you just a little bit of
protection<00:03:10.680> on<00:03:11.070> the<00:03:11.130> front<00:03:11.489> but<00:03:12.030> also<00:03:12.060> protect

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
protection on the front but also protect

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:16.340 
protection on the front but also protect
those<00:03:13.530> a<00:03:13.890> arms<00:03:14.220> from<00:03:14.430> getting<00:03:14.730> hit<00:03:15.090> and<00:03:15.360> broken

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
those a arms from getting hit and broken

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:18.979 
those a arms from getting hit and broken
so<00:03:17.040> I<00:03:17.370> think<00:03:17.850> this<00:03:18.209> is<00:03:18.269> the<00:03:18.540> one<00:03:18.630> I'm<00:03:18.780> going<00:03:18.930> to

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
so I think this is the one I'm going to

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:21.650 
so I think this is the one I'm going to
end<00:03:19.170> up<00:03:19.320> running<00:03:19.530> on<00:03:19.890> the<00:03:20.310> front<00:03:20.670> it<00:03:21.630> is

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660 
end up running on the front it is

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:24.410 
end up running on the front it is
definitely<00:03:22.910> about<00:03:23.910> the<00:03:24.090> amount<00:03:24.360> of

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
definitely about the amount of

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.750 
definitely about the amount of
protection<00:03:24.630> that<00:03:24.930> I<00:03:25.230> was<00:03:25.470> looking<00:03:25.830> for<00:03:26.070> and

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
protection that I was looking for and

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.460 
protection that I was looking for and
then<00:03:27.000> the<00:03:27.120> last<00:03:27.269> one<00:03:27.540> this<00:03:27.690> is<00:03:27.750> just<00:03:27.900> a<00:03:28.200> rear

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
then the last one this is just a rear

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:32.449 
then the last one this is just a rear
skid<00:03:28.920> this<00:03:29.670> matches<00:03:30.180> up<00:03:30.209> with<00:03:30.540> that<00:03:31.010> pro<00:03:32.010> front

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
skid this matches up with that pro front

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:34.759 
skid this matches up with that pro front
and<00:03:32.790> it<00:03:33.269> just<00:03:33.450> gives<00:03:33.660> you<00:03:33.780> a<00:03:33.810> minimal<00:03:34.440> amount

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:34.769 
and it just gives you a minimal amount

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:37.640 
and it just gives you a minimal amount
of<00:03:35.010> rear<00:03:35.760> protection<00:03:36.390> right<00:03:36.540> there<00:03:36.780> and<00:03:37.049> these

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
of rear protection right there and these

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:39.620 
of rear protection right there and these
are<00:03:37.830> super<00:03:38.250> thin<00:03:38.459> guys<00:03:38.670> they're<00:03:39.239> not<00:03:39.420> going<00:03:39.600> to

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:39.630 
are super thin guys they're not going to

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:42.470 
are super thin guys they're not going to
take<00:03:39.840> away<00:03:40.140> from<00:03:40.170> any<00:03:40.620> of<00:03:40.890> your<00:03:41.040> travel<00:03:41.640> from

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
take away from any of your travel from

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.110 
take away from any of your travel from
your<00:03:42.630> shot<00:03:42.900> so<00:03:43.230> don't<00:03:43.560> worry<00:03:43.739> about<00:03:43.860> that<00:03:44.220> all

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
your shot so don't worry about that all

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.240 
your shot so don't worry about that all
of<00:03:45.299> these<00:03:45.420> include<00:03:46.260> a<00:03:46.500> little<00:03:46.830> bit<00:03:46.980> longer

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
of these include a little bit longer

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:50.180 
of these include a little bit longer
hardware<00:03:47.850> so<00:03:48.239> that<00:03:48.269> you<00:03:49.260> can<00:03:49.410> not<00:03:49.560> only<00:03:49.620> thread

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 
hardware so that you can not only thread

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:52.970 
hardware so that you can not only thread
in<00:03:50.340> through<00:03:50.700> the<00:03:51.390> skids<00:03:51.810> but<00:03:52.170> also<00:03:52.380> thread

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
in through the skids but also thread

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:56.210 
in through the skids but also thread
into<00:03:53.160> your<00:03:53.820> diff<00:03:54.570> housings<00:03:55.110> and<00:03:55.380> have<00:03:55.650> enough

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 
into your diff housings and have enough

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:59.330 
into your diff housings and have enough
coverage<00:03:56.940> there<00:03:57.450> so<00:03:58.410> let<00:03:58.769> me<00:03:58.799> get<00:03:59.010> on<00:03:59.130> to

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
coverage there so let me get on to

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.190 
coverage there so let me get on to
installing<00:03:59.760> these<00:04:00.180> I'm<00:04:00.450> going<00:04:00.600> to<00:04:00.660> bring<00:04:01.049> it

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200 
installing these I'm going to bring it

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:02.960 
installing these I'm going to bring it

to installing a little sheet there and

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:49.490 
to installing a little sheet there and

00:04:59.129 --> 00:05:03.020 
these manufacturers do and that could
alter<00:04:59.550> the<00:04:59.580> threading<00:05:00.330> of<00:05:01.669> your<00:05:02.669> particular

fit<00:05:05.039> theirs<00:05:05.370> on<00:05:05.759> so<00:05:06.479> definitely<00:05:06.900> double<00:05:07.259> check

00:05:07.459 --> 00:05:07.469 
fit theirs on so definitely double check

00:05:07.469 --> 00:05:09.469 
fit theirs on so definitely double check
that<00:05:07.500> before<00:05:07.710> mine<00:05:08.669> had<00:05:08.969> no<00:05:09.150> issues
