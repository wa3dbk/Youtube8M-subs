00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:44.980 
years ago TC was a new thing for

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:47.520 
years ago TC was a new thing for
motorcycles<00:00:45.640> and<00:00:45.820> the<00:00:46.570> advancement<00:00:47.440> has

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:47.530 
motorcycles and the advancement has

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:49.230 
motorcycles and the advancement has
really<00:00:47.860> progressed<00:00:48.310> a<00:00:48.460> lot<00:00:48.640> so<00:00:48.880> we<00:00:48.910> want<00:00:49.150> to

really progressed a lot so we want to
see<00:00:49.420> just<00:00:49.720> how<00:00:49.780> much<00:00:50.050> it's<00:00:50.320> how<00:00:50.530> far<00:00:50.800> it's<00:00:50.890> come

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:51.430 
see just how much it's how far it's come

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:55.020 
see just how much it's how far it's come
and<00:00:51.520> so<00:00:52.150> with<00:00:53.020> that<00:00:53.260> live<00:00:54.130> the<00:00:54.250> Tom<00:00:54.430> and<00:00:54.460> get

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:55.030 
and so with that live the Tom and get

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.720 
and so with that live the Tom and get
his<00:00:55.150> impressions<00:00:55.620> so<00:00:56.620> yeah<00:00:57.100> I<00:00:57.130> mean<00:00:57.430> between

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:57.730 
his impressions so yeah I mean between

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:00.060 
his impressions so yeah I mean between
these<00:00:58.000> two<00:00:58.180> bikes<00:00:58.390> I<00:00:58.720> think<00:00:59.470> we<00:00:59.590> all<00:00:59.740> probably

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:00.070 
these two bikes I think we all probably

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:02.280 
these two bikes I think we all probably
know<00:01:00.250> that<00:01:00.730> the<00:01:00.940> Aprilia<00:01:01.300> is<00:01:01.570> these<00:01:01.870> more

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:02.290 
know that the Aprilia is these more

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:05.550 
know that the Aprilia is these more
pricier<00:01:02.980> of<00:01:03.220> the<00:01:03.310> two<00:01:03.460> models<00:01:03.930> so<00:01:04.930> we're<00:01:05.470> going

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:05.560 
pricier of the two models so we're going

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.399 
pricier of the two models so we're going
to<00:01:05.650> also<00:01:05.829> really<00:01:06.310> be<00:01:06.430> looking<00:01:06.850> at<00:01:07.000> is<00:01:07.689> the

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:08.409 
to also really be looking at is the

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:10.170 
to also really be looking at is the
traction<00:01:08.829> control<00:01:08.860> system<00:01:09.549> on<00:01:09.670> the<00:01:09.790> Aprilia

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:10.180 
traction control system on the Aprilia

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:12.300 
traction control system on the Aprilia
you<00:01:10.720> know<00:01:10.810> worthy<00:01:11.259> of<00:01:11.380> its<00:01:11.530> higher<00:01:11.650> price<00:01:11.979> and

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:12.310 
you know worthy of its higher price and

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:14.399 
you know worthy of its higher price and
then<00:01:12.909> we'll<00:01:13.030> also<00:01:13.240> be<00:01:13.479> pulling<00:01:13.780> together<00:01:13.900> kind

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:14.409 
then we'll also be pulling together kind

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:17.130 
then we'll also be pulling together kind
of<00:01:14.470> in<00:01:14.590> a<00:01:14.619> consensus<00:01:15.369> a<00:01:15.579> bike<00:01:16.450> as<00:01:16.630> the<00:01:16.780> whole<00:01:16.960> is

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:17.140 
of in a consensus a bike as the whole is

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.830 
of in a consensus a bike as the whole is
the<00:01:17.499> Aprilia<00:01:17.859> better<00:01:18.789> package<00:01:19.299> all<00:01:19.509> around

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:19.840 
the Aprilia better package all around

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.319 
the Aprilia better package all around
then<00:01:20.380> the<00:01:20.530> Yamaha<00:01:21.039> is<00:01:21.280> especially<00:01:21.909> for<00:01:22.240> the

00:01:22.319 --> 00:01:22.329 
then the Yamaha is especially for the

00:01:22.329 --> 00:01:24.569 
then the Yamaha is especially for the
price<00:01:22.420> difference<00:01:22.929> so<00:01:23.499> that's<00:01:24.009> the<00:01:24.130> two<00:01:24.340> kind

00:01:24.569 --> 00:01:24.579 
price difference so that's the two kind

00:01:24.579 --> 00:01:25.889 
price difference so that's the two kind
of<00:01:24.609> main<00:01:24.819> things<00:01:25.119> will<00:01:25.299> really<00:01:25.450> be<00:01:25.689> toying

00:01:25.889 --> 00:01:25.899 
of main things will really be toying

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:28.200 
of main things will really be toying
with<00:01:26.079> today<00:01:26.530> and<00:01:26.829> by<00:01:27.670> the<00:01:27.729> end<00:01:27.939> of<00:01:28.060> this

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:28.210 
with today and by the end of this

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.149 
with today and by the end of this
afternoon<00:01:29.049> we<00:01:29.259> should<00:01:29.439> be<00:01:29.560> able<00:01:29.649> to<00:01:29.799> bring<00:01:29.979> you

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:32.590 
a a pretty good final decision let's go

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:34.129 
a a pretty good final decision let's go
into<00:01:32.710> more<00:01:32.859> detail<00:01:33.219> about<00:01:33.249> both<00:01:33.520> bikes

00:01:34.129 --> 00:01:34.139 
into more detail about both bikes

00:01:34.139 --> 00:01:37.230 
into more detail about both bikes
firstly<00:01:35.139> Yamaha<00:01:35.999> powered<00:01:36.999> by<00:01:37.179> the

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.699 
difference between the 2012 and 2011
model<00:02:37.500> is<00:02:38.069> you've<00:02:38.250> got<00:02:38.430> these<00:02:39.049> headlight<00:02:40.049> LEDs

clamp<00:02:47.549> is<00:02:47.700> also<00:02:48.090> more<00:02:48.989> inspired<00:02:49.409> by<00:02:49.620> the

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
clamp is also more inspired by the

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:51.830 
clamp is also more inspired by the
MotoGP<00:02:50.219> bike<00:02:50.760> because<00:02:51.239> it<00:02:51.359> kind<00:02:51.510> of<00:02:51.540> a<00:02:51.629> cooler

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
MotoGP bike because it kind of a cooler

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.819 
MotoGP bike because it kind of a cooler
race<00:02:52.079> bike<00:02:52.349> look<00:02:52.620> and<00:02:54.019> really<00:02:55.019> for<00:02:55.260> 2012

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:55.829 
race bike look and really for 2012

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:57.800 
race bike look and really for 2012
that's<00:02:56.159> the<00:02:56.370> main<00:02:56.579> difference<00:02:57.060> between<00:02:57.090> this

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
that's the main difference between this

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:11.330 
that's the main difference between this
bike<00:02:58.079> and<00:02:58.349> the<00:02:58.829> previous<00:02:59.280> model<00:03:10.129> for<00:03:11.129> the

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
bike and the previous model for the

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.229 
bike and the previous model for the
Aprilia<00:03:11.750> this<00:03:12.750> is<00:03:12.900> a<00:03:12.930> 2011<00:03:13.379> model<00:03:13.889> but<00:03:14.730> it's

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:15.239 
Aprilia this is a 2011 model but it's

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:18.199 
Aprilia this is a 2011 model but it's
not<00:03:15.419> any<00:03:15.659> different<00:03:15.750> than<00:03:16.109> the<00:03:16.230> 2012<00:03:17.030> and<00:03:18.030> so

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
not any different than the 2012 and so

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:19.939 
not any different than the 2012 and so
it<00:03:18.329> this<00:03:18.449> will<00:03:18.569> be<00:03:18.659> a<00:03:18.689> good<00:03:18.900> baseline<00:03:19.290> to<00:03:19.709> judge

00:03:19.939 --> 00:03:19.949 
it this will be a good baseline to judge

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:23.990 
it this will be a good baseline to judge
off<00:03:20.189> of<00:03:20.430> and<00:03:21.230> this<00:03:22.230> is<00:03:22.290> one<00:03:22.680> of<00:03:22.829> the<00:03:23.010> slimmer

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
off of and this is one of the slimmer

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.610 
off of and this is one of the slimmer
motorcycles<00:03:24.689> in<00:03:24.750> the<00:03:24.840> class<00:03:25.079> it's<00:03:25.470> really

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
motorcycles in the class it's really

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.649 
motorcycles in the class it's really
narrow<00:03:26.250> compared<00:03:26.849> especially<00:03:27.299> compared<00:03:27.599> to

00:03:27.649 --> 00:03:27.659 
narrow compared especially compared to

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:31.280 
narrow compared especially compared to
the<00:03:27.780> r1<00:03:28.159> it's<00:03:29.159> got<00:03:29.310> a<00:03:29.340> v4<00:03:29.909> engine<00:03:30.150> that's<00:03:31.109> why

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
the r1 it's got a v4 engine that's why

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:32.629 
the r1 it's got a v4 engine that's why
it's<00:03:31.470> a<00:03:31.530> lot<00:03:31.620> more<00:03:31.799> narrow<00:03:32.009> there's<00:03:32.310> only<00:03:32.400> two

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:32.639 
it's a lot more narrow there's only two

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:36.319 
it's a lot more narrow there's only two
cylinders<00:03:33.180> inline<00:03:34.049> back<00:03:34.739> to<00:03:34.919> back<00:03:35.099> in<00:03:35.549> a<00:03:36.120> V

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:36.329 
cylinders inline back to back in a V

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:40.399 
cylinders inline back to back in a V
angle<00:03:37.790> slot<00:03:38.790> and<00:03:38.939> our<00:03:39.060> a<00:03:39.419> lot<00:03:39.689> more<00:03:39.900> compact

00:03:40.399 --> 00:03:40.409 
angle slot and our a lot more compact

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:42.649 
angle slot and our a lot more compact
again<00:03:41.370> you've<00:03:41.579> also<00:03:41.699> got<00:03:41.909> the<00:03:42.030> huge<00:03:42.269> Brembo

00:03:42.649 --> 00:03:42.659 
again you've also got the huge Brembo

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:44.960 
again you've also got the huge Brembo
brakes<00:03:42.989> great<00:03:43.709> amounts<00:03:44.009> of<00:03:44.069> brakes<00:03:44.310> really

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
brakes great amounts of brakes really

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:48.920

strong a brake lever feel
yeah<00:03:49.889> the<00:03:50.040> v4<00:03:50.489> is<00:03:50.699> a<00:03:50.729> lot<00:03:50.879> because<00:03:51.180> that's

00:03:51.679 --> 00:03:51.689 
yeah the v4 is a lot because that's

00:03:51.689 --> 00:03:53.599 
yeah the v4 is a lot because that's
where<00:03:51.810> the<00:03:51.900> character<00:03:52.319> is<00:03:52.349> of<00:03:52.650> this<00:03:52.769> bike<00:03:53.040> it's

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:53.609 
where the character is of this bike it's

00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:58.960 
where the character is of this bike it's
