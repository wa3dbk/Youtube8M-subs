00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:17.900 
have sort of heard this term ordnance
drops<00:00:16.800> are<00:00:16.949> basically<00:00:17.250> in<00:00:17.369> new<00:00:17.520> ways<00:00:17.670> to<00:00:17.699> get

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
drops are basically in new ways to get

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.609 
drops are basically in new ways to get
weapons<00:00:18.119> onto<00:00:18.480> the<00:00:18.690> battlefield<00:00:18.840> in<00:00:19.320> Halo<00:00:19.529> 4

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
weapons onto the battlefield in Halo 4

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.439 
weapons onto the battlefield in Halo 4
so<00:00:20.070> as<00:00:20.160> you<00:00:20.279> can<00:00:20.369> see<00:00:20.580> you<00:00:21.000> can<00:00:21.119> place<00:00:21.300> these

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
so as you can see you can place these

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.810 
so as you can see you can place these
down<00:00:21.660> in<00:00:21.810> fours<00:00:22.080> and<00:00:22.350> then<00:00:22.980> when<00:00:23.519> the<00:00:23.609> player

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
down in fours and then when the player

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.730 
down in fours and then when the player
does<00:00:24.090> pick<00:00:24.269> up<00:00:24.359> the<00:00:24.510> weapon<00:00:24.840> the<00:00:25.350> ordnance

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
the three different types of ordnance

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.260 
the three different types of ordnance
points<00:00:39.690> there<00:00:40.379> are<00:00:40.559> objective<00:00:41.250> drops<00:00:41.579> initial

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
points there are objective drops initial

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.990 
points there are objective drops initial
drops<00:00:42.540> and<00:00:42.840> random<00:00:43.530> drops<00:00:43.800> now<00:00:44.370> objective

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
drops and random drops now objective

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.400 
drops and random drops now objective
drops<00:00:45.239> are<00:00:45.450> actually<00:00:45.719> just<00:00:45.899> going<00:00:45.960> to<00:00:46.110> be<00:00:46.230> used

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
drops are actually just going to be used

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.740 
drops are actually just going to be used
in<00:00:46.620> Dominion<00:00:47.129> and<00:00:47.430> of<00:00:48.210> course<00:00:48.420> we<00:00:48.570> will<00:00:48.719> have

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
in Dominion and of course we will have

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.930 
in Dominion and of course we will have
tutorials<00:00:49.440> covering<00:00:49.770> Dominion<00:00:50.280> so<00:00:50.730> I<00:00:50.760> won't

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
tutorials covering Dominion so I won't

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:58.189 
tutorials covering Dominion so I won't
talk<00:00:51.210> too<00:00:51.390> much<00:00:51.510> about<00:00:51.570> that<00:00:54.050> but<00:00:55.100> the<00:00:57.199> initial

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
talk too much about that but the initial

00:00:58.199 --> 00:00:59.599 
talk too much about that but the initial
and<00:00:58.500> random<00:00:58.800> drops<00:00:59.039> aren't<00:00:59.280> going<00:00:59.399> to<00:00:59.460> be<00:00:59.579> used

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
and random drops aren't going to be used

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.590 
and random drops aren't going to be used
on<00:00:59.969> your<00:01:00.180> standard<00:01:00.570> competitive<00:01:01.140> maps<00:01:01.379> so<00:01:02.600> the

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
on your standard competitive maps so the

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.260 
on your standard competitive maps so the
initial<00:01:04.110> drop<00:01:04.320> is<00:01:04.760> basically<00:01:05.760> where<00:01:06.060> your

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
initial drop is basically where your

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:07.670 
initial drop is basically where your
power<00:01:06.510> weapons<00:01:06.900> are<00:01:07.020> gonna<00:01:07.140> spawn<00:01:07.439> at<00:01:07.590> the

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
power weapons are gonna spawn at the

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.010 
power weapons are gonna spawn at the
beginning<00:01:07.979> of<00:01:08.220> a<00:01:08.400> match<00:01:08.610> so<00:01:09.270> you<00:01:09.330> know<00:01:09.659> for

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
beginning of a match so you know for

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.780 
beginning of a match so you know for
each<00:01:10.200> initial<00:01:10.590> drop<00:01:10.770> it's<00:01:11.070> very<00:01:11.310> simple<00:01:11.670> to

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
each initial drop it's very simple to

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.609 
each initial drop it's very simple to
setup<00:01:12.000> you<00:01:12.630> just<00:01:12.780> go<00:01:12.930> down<00:01:13.049> to<00:01:13.229> ordnance

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
setup you just go down to ordnance

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.240 
setup you just go down to ordnance
initial<00:01:14.130> drop<00:01:14.340> place<00:01:15.150> it<00:01:15.360> and<00:01:15.860> then<00:01:16.860> you<00:01:17.100> will

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
initial drop place it and then you will

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.149 
initial drop place it and then you will
pick<00:01:17.549> whichever<00:01:18.119> weapon<00:01:18.630> you<00:01:18.780> want<00:01:18.960> and<00:01:19.229> of

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
pick whichever weapon you want and of

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.550 
pick whichever weapon you want and of
course<00:01:20.400> a<00:01:20.640> spawn<00:01:21.000> timer<00:01:21.330> and<00:01:21.570> of<00:01:22.259> course

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
course a spawn timer and of course

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.920 
course a spawn timer and of course
sometimes<00:01:22.979> they're<00:01:23.520> these<00:01:24.150> initial<00:01:24.689> drop

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
sometimes they're these initial drop

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.120 
sometimes they're these initial drop
weapons<00:01:25.860> do<00:01:26.280> not<00:01:26.460> actually<00:01:26.729> respawn<00:01:27.590> so<00:01:28.590> yeah

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
weapons do not actually respawn so yeah

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.710 
weapons do not actually respawn so yeah
it's<00:01:29.340> really<00:01:29.430> simple<00:01:29.880> it's<00:01:30.210> you<00:01:30.630> know

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
it's really simple it's you know

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.050 
it's really simple it's you know
basically<00:01:31.350> like<00:01:31.619> just<00:01:31.680> placing<00:01:32.610> the<00:01:32.759> weapon

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
basically like just placing the weapon

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.280 
basically like just placing the weapon
on<00:01:33.150> the<00:01:33.240> mount<00:01:33.390> which<00:01:33.570> of<00:01:33.689> course<00:01:33.750> you<00:01:34.049> still

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
on the mount which of course you still

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.410 
on the mount which of course you still
can<00:01:34.590> do<00:01:34.860> but<00:01:35.220> you<00:01:35.700> know<00:01:35.790> to<00:01:35.970> fit<00:01:36.150> with<00:01:36.299> the

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
can do but you know to fit with the

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.469 
can do but you know to fit with the
system<00:01:36.810> it<00:01:36.930> would<00:01:37.110> make<00:01:37.799> sense<00:01:38.100> to<00:01:38.490> keep<00:01:39.240> with

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
system it would make sense to keep with

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.620 
system it would make sense to keep with
the<00:01:39.509> ordnance<00:01:40.229> so<00:01:40.979> yeah<00:01:41.549> so<00:01:41.790> you<00:01:42.180> know<00:01:42.210> really

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
the ordnance so yeah so you know really

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.330 
the ordnance so yeah so you know really
straightforward<00:01:42.899> really<00:01:43.470> simple<00:01:43.829> so<00:01:44.159> then

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
straightforward really simple so then

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.410 
straightforward really simple so then
random<00:01:45.030> drops<00:01:45.270> are<00:01:46.399> basically<00:01:47.399> you<00:01:47.909> know<00:01:48.000> the

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
random drops are basically you know the

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.010 
random drops are basically you know the

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
on the map at an interval of I believe

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:10.010 
on the map at an interval of I believe
every<00:02:06.479> two<00:02:06.689> minutes<00:02:07.020> so<00:02:08.270> you<00:02:09.270> know<00:02:09.390> it's
