00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:50.350 
version of the song that I heard and

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:52.080 
version of the song that I heard and
still<00:03:50.680> remains<00:03:51.010> to<00:03:51.220> be<00:03:51.250> one<00:03:51.489> of<00:03:51.579> my<00:03:51.609> favorites

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.090 
still remains to be one of my favorites

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:53.849 
still remains to be one of my favorites
even<00:03:52.269> though<00:03:52.630> the<00:03:53.079> live<00:03:53.260> version<00:03:53.500> is

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:53.859 
even though the live version is

00:03:53.859 --> 00:03:55.500 
even though the live version is
certainly<00:03:54.370> no<00:03:54.519> slouch<00:03:54.579> in<00:03:54.880> that<00:03:55.150> department

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:55.510 
certainly no slouch in that department

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:59.360 
certainly no slouch in that department
also<00:03:57.030> now<00:03:58.030> the<00:03:58.090> two<00:03:58.299> singles<00:03:58.720> that<00:03:58.900> both

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
also now the two singles that both

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:01.890 
also now the two singles that both
experienced<00:04:00.370> and<00:04:00.489> enjoyed<00:04:00.900> long-term

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:01.900 
experienced and enjoyed long-term

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:03.750 
experienced and enjoyed long-term
success<00:04:02.410> on<00:04:02.680> the<00:04:02.829> radio<00:04:03.099> airwaves<00:04:03.370> which

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:03.760 
success on the radio airwaves which

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:05.910 
success on the radio airwaves which
definitely<00:04:04.120> gave<00:04:04.359> Jarrah<00:04:04.660> flies<00:04:04.930> as<00:04:05.170> an<00:04:05.260> EP<00:04:05.739> a

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:05.920 
definitely gave Jarrah flies as an EP a

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:07.410 
definitely gave Jarrah flies as an EP a
lot<00:04:06.190> of<00:04:06.310> promotion<00:04:06.819> this<00:04:06.970> is<00:04:07.120> something

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:07.420 
lot of promotion this is something

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:09.750 
lot of promotion this is something
that's<00:04:07.599> very<00:04:07.660> unlike<00:04:08.380> in<00:04:08.590> the<00:04:08.680> EP<00:04:09.010> whenever

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:09.760 
that's very unlike in the EP whenever

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:11.940 
that's very unlike in the EP whenever
you<00:04:09.849> think<00:04:09.970> about<00:04:10.239> a<00:04:10.709> extended<00:04:11.709> play

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:11.950 
you think about a extended play

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:13.860 
you think about a extended play
especially<00:04:12.459> one<00:04:12.910> that<00:04:13.090> was<00:04:13.269> not<00:04:13.450> only<00:04:13.569> number

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:13.870 
especially one that was not only number

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:16.740 
especially one that was not only number
one<00:04:14.190> but<00:04:15.190> has<00:04:15.459> enjoyed<00:04:15.880> triple<00:04:16.389> platinum

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:16.750 
one but has enjoyed triple platinum

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:18.300 
one but has enjoyed triple platinum
sales<00:04:16.989> there<00:04:17.560> definitely<00:04:17.769> has<00:04:18.010> to<00:04:18.099> be<00:04:18.220> a

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:18.310 
sales there definitely has to be a

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:20.190 
sales there definitely has to be a
reason<00:04:18.639> behind<00:04:18.669> that<00:04:19.060> not<00:04:19.239> all<00:04:19.450> three<00:04:19.750> million

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:20.200 
reason behind that not all three million

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:23.010 
reason behind that not all three million
people<00:04:20.680> are<00:04:20.889> buying<00:04:21.430> this<00:04:21.669> album<00:04:22.180> all<00:04:22.360> at<00:04:22.780> once

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:23.020 
people are buying this album all at once

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:24.990 
people are buying this album all at once
if<00:04:23.320> that<00:04:23.650> were<00:04:23.740> to<00:04:23.860> happen<00:04:23.890> that<00:04:24.789> would<00:04:24.880> be

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.000 
if that were to happen that would be

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.400 
if that were to happen that would be
ridiculous<00:04:25.599> I<00:04:25.810> imagine<00:04:26.740> that<00:04:26.770> it<00:04:26.919> would<00:04:27.070> be

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:27.410 
ridiculous I imagine that it would be

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:29.320 
ridiculous I imagine that it would be
just<00:04:27.620> absolutely<00:04:28.100> pandemonium<00:04:28.760> considering

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:29.330 
just absolutely pandemonium considering

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:31.480 
just absolutely pandemonium considering
I<00:04:29.510> have<00:04:29.630> seen<00:04:29.930> what<00:04:30.320> one<00:04:30.560> store<00:04:30.890> is<00:04:31.010> like<00:04:31.250> on<00:04:31.460> a

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:31.490 
I have seen what one store is like on a

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:34.000 
I have seen what one store is like on a
week<00:04:31.730> in<00:04:31.850> which<00:04:31.940> an<00:04:32.090> artist<00:04:32.240> just<00:04:32.600> hits<00:04:33.530> close

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:34.010 
week in which an artist just hits close

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:37.120 
week in which an artist just hits close
to<00:04:34.280> 1<00:04:34.580> million<00:04:34.850> and<00:04:35.140> that's<00:04:36.140> certainly<00:04:36.470> a<00:04:36.740> busy

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:37.130 
to 1 million and that's certainly a busy

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:39.280 
to 1 million and that's certainly a busy
busy<00:04:37.400> week<00:04:37.580> if<00:04:38.120> all<00:04:38.300> three<00:04:38.600> million<00:04:38.930> came<00:04:39.110> in

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:39.290 
busy week if all three million came in

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:41.200 
busy week if all three million came in
you<00:04:39.740> would<00:04:39.890> literally<00:04:40.130> have<00:04:40.400> people<00:04:40.730> in<00:04:40.940> line

out the door but both of these songs

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:46.270

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:04.880 
that I've really feel are some of the

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:06.790 
that I've really feel are some of the
strongest<00:05:05.120> material<00:05:05.810> and<00:05:05.990> most<00:05:06.380> different

the tripod album then damn man that's

the tripod album then damn man that's
really<00:05:12.050> really<00:05:12.410> hard<00:05:12.860> to<00:05:13.580> follow<00:05:13.760> up<00:05:14.090> and<00:05:15.020> they

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:15.110 
really really hard to follow up and they

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:18.600 
really really hard to follow up and they
did<00:05:15.290> their<00:05:15.410> best<00:05:15.440> but<00:05:16.270> it's<00:05:17.270> difficult<00:05:17.450> to<00:05:17.750> do

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:18.610 
did their best but it's difficult to do

did their best but it's difficult to do
another<00:05:19.610> curious<00:05:20.030> idea<00:05:20.270> was<00:05:20.660> well<00:05:20.870> and<00:05:21.080> wasp

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:21.350 
another curious idea was well and wasp

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:23.770 
another curious idea was well and wasp
this<00:05:21.830> was<00:05:22.010> largely<00:05:22.610> instrumental<00:05:23.450> and<00:05:23.630> one

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:23.780 
this was largely instrumental and one

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:25.180 
this was largely instrumental and one
that<00:05:23.930> included<00:05:24.380> strings<00:05:24.770> this<00:05:25.070> was

that included strings this was

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:27.160 
that included strings this was
definitely<00:05:25.370> ambitious<00:05:26.210> and<00:05:26.420> it<00:05:26.810> was<00:05:26.960> one

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:27.170 
definitely ambitious and it was one

definitely ambitious and it was one
that's<00:05:27.410> certainly<00:05:28.130> probably<00:05:28.580> took<00:05:28.700> a<00:05:28.820> lot<00:05:28.910> of

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:29.030 
that's certainly probably took a lot of

that's certainly probably took a lot of
people<00:05:29.240> off-guard<00:05:29.390> this<00:05:29.810> was<00:05:30.080> eventually
