00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:24.119
 called the reins of the thunderous nix in 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.269
 cloud serpent is one of the most 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:30.119

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.879
 we run such a bridge we pass and there will be 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:51.449
 so could he draw every half hour 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:53.430
 dash hour and he flies out of here every 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:56.070

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.990

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:52.380
 but personally I will be paid to mount approximately from 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:56.250
 but 10 times I donâ€™t remember when I farm 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:58.950

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.810

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.780
 we need to get on out of time 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.690
 the island is here to pass such a bridge and we 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:09.539

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.920

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:19.260
