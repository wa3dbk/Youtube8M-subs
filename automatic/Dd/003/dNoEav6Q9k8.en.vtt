calculate the time of submission which

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.940 
calculate the time of submission which
is<00:01:48.710> probably<00:01:48.950> why<00:01:49.159> the<00:01:49.219> average<00:01:49.490> is<00:01:49.789> so<00:01:49.969> low

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:50.950 
is probably why the average is so low

2010<00:03:56.000> well<00:03:56.660> I<00:03:56.720> believe<00:03:57.200> the<00:03:57.410> totals<00:03:57.739> actually

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.010 
2010 well I believe the totals actually

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:00.520 
2010 well I believe the totals actually
round<00:03:58.220> 107<00:03:58.970> million<00:03:59.180> but<00:03:59.900> I<00:03:59.930> have<00:04:00.260> no<00:04:00.410> idea

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:00.530 
round 107 million but I have no idea

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:02.319 
round 107 million but I have no idea
whether<00:04:00.889> they<00:04:01.100> have<00:04:01.340> or<00:04:01.549> have<00:04:01.670> not<00:04:01.700> sold<00:04:02.120> their

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:02.329 
whether they have or have not sold their

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:05.530 
whether they have or have not sold their
shares<00:04:02.359> they're<00:04:02.840> eligible<00:04:04.000> there's<00:04:05.000> reasons

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:05.540 
shares they're eligible there's reasons

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:08.860 
shares they're eligible there's reasons
why<00:04:05.660> they<00:04:05.870> probably<00:04:06.230> haven't<00:04:06.670> the<00:04:07.670> tax<00:04:07.940> for

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:08.870 
why they probably haven't the tax for

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:11.530 
why they probably haven't the tax for
those<00:04:09.280> holding<00:04:10.280> shares<00:04:10.459> for<00:04:11.090> six<00:04:11.269> months

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:11.540 
those holding shares for six months

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:14.020 
those holding shares for six months
versus<00:04:11.959> a<00:04:11.989> year<00:04:12.380> is<00:04:12.530> much<00:04:12.799> higher<00:04:13.010> so<00:04:13.730> I<00:04:13.760> don't

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:14.030 
versus a year is much higher so I don't

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:15.849 
versus a year is much higher so I don't
know<00:04:14.120> they<00:04:14.720> may<00:04:14.870> have<00:04:14.959> lifted<00:04:15.260> the<00:04:15.410> legends

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:15.859

00:04:15.859 --> 00:04:18.219
