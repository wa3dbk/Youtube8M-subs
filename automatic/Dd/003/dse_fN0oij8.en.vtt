00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
by me on this game there are plenty of

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.680 
by me on this game there are plenty of
reasons<00:00:16.080> why<00:00:16.440> and<00:00:16.740> I<00:00:17.430> think<00:00:18.210> the<00:00:18.510> main<00:00:18.660> reason

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
reasons why and I think the main reason

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.570 
reasons why and I think the main reason
is<00:00:19.080> is<00:00:19.260> because<00:00:19.289> it's<00:00:19.740> a<00:00:19.830> shit<00:00:20.070> game<00:00:20.279> in<00:00:20.460> my

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
is is because it's a shit game in my

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.509 
is is because it's a shit game in my
opinion<00:00:20.609> I<00:00:21.300> mean<00:00:22.080> playing<00:00:22.380> a<00:00:22.470> simple<00:00:22.800> I<00:00:22.890> don't

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519

opinion I mean playing a simple I don't
like<00:00:23.760> this<00:00:23.939> game<00:00:24.150> i<00:00:24.210> think<00:00:24.390> it's<00:00:25.039> it's<00:00:26.039> too

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
like this game i think it's it's too

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.529 
like this game i think it's it's too
early<00:00:27.439> I<00:00:28.609> can't<00:00:29.609> find<00:00:29.820> the<00:00:29.910> right<00:00:30.000> word<00:00:30.240> for<00:00:30.269> it

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
early I can't find the right word for it

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.020 
early I can't find the right word for it
but<00:00:30.570> it's<00:00:30.869> just<00:00:30.929> not<00:00:31.109> my<00:00:31.410> style<00:00:31.520> it's<00:00:32.520> not<00:00:32.790> like

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
but it's just not my style it's not like

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.600 
but it's just not my style it's not like
more<00:00:33.420> warfare<00:00:33.750> two<00:00:33.930> it's<00:00:34.290> not<00:00:34.440> as<00:00:34.710> fast<00:00:35.130> paced

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
more warfare two it's not as fast paced

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.880 
more warfare two it's not as fast paced
I<00:00:36.059> don't<00:00:36.600> like<00:00:36.690> the<00:00:36.930> guns<00:00:37.140> on<00:00:37.320> this<00:00:37.440> game<00:00:37.680> their

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
I don't like the guns on this game their

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.959 
I don't like the guns on this game their
shit<00:00:38.219> and<00:00:38.629> I<00:00:39.629> kind<00:00:39.930> of<00:00:39.960> just<00:00:40.110> wish<00:00:40.290> it<00:00:40.320> was<00:00:40.530> more

00:00:40.959 --> 00:00:40.969 
shit and I kind of just wish it was more

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:44.330 
shit and I kind of just wish it was more
like<00:00:41.969> cod4<00:00:42.570> I<00:00:42.870> know<00:00:43.200> obviously<00:00:43.649> because<00:00:44.160> it

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
like cod4 I know obviously because it

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:45.709 
like cod4 I know obviously because it
was<00:00:44.430> designed<00:00:44.789> by<00:00:44.910> treyarch<00:00:45.420> and<00:00:45.600> not

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
was designed by treyarch and not

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.450 
was designed by treyarch and not
infinity<00:00:46.140> ward<00:00:46.350> it's<00:00:47.010> going<00:00:47.280> to<00:00:47.340> be<00:00:47.430> a

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
infinity ward it's going to be a

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.000 
infinity ward it's going to be a
different<00:00:47.789> game<00:00:47.969> but<00:00:48.329> I<00:00:48.770> think<00:00:49.770> there's<00:00:49.920> just

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
different game but I think there's just

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.910 
different game but I think there's just
certain<00:00:50.219> aspect<00:00:50.730> to<00:00:50.820> this<00:00:50.940> get<00:00:51.149> acts<00:00:51.710> the<00:00:52.710> same

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
certain aspect to this get acts the same

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.100 
certain aspect to this get acts the same
aspects<00:00:53.579> of<00:00:53.699> this<00:00:53.940> game<00:00:54.210> I<00:00:54.420> just<00:00:54.629> really<00:00:55.079> can't

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
aspects of this game I just really can't

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.709 
aspects of this game I just really can't
get<00:00:55.440> on<00:00:55.559> with<00:00:55.770> and<00:00:56.030> I<00:00:57.030> think<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.329> main<00:00:57.510> problem

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
get on with and I think the main problem

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:02.770 
get on with and I think the main problem
for<00:00:58.020> me<00:00:58.170> is<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:59.120> mp40<00:01:00.120> juggernaut<00:01:00.870> class<00:01:01.410> and

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:02.780 
for me is the mp40 juggernaut class and

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:07.490 
for me is the mp40 juggernaut class and
look<00:01:03.780> at<00:01:03.899> that<00:01:03.930> I<00:01:04.320> mean<00:01:05.450> look<00:01:06.450> at<00:01:06.570> this<00:01:06.720> mp40

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
look at that I mean look at this mp40

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.090 
look at that I mean look at this mp40
juggernaut<00:01:08.040> he<00:01:08.490> rapes<00:01:08.729> me<00:01:09.000> ok<00:01:09.210> but<00:01:09.390> on<00:01:09.540> my

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:10.100 
juggernaut he rapes me ok but on my

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.950 
juggernaut he rapes me ok but on my

UAV<00:01:51.630> I'll<00:01:52.470> get<00:01:52.619> two<00:01:52.799> more<00:01:52.920> kills<00:01:53.130> because<00:01:53.310> I

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
UAV I'll get two more kills because I

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.670 
UAV I'll get two more kills because I
don't<00:01:54.060> normally<00:01:54.210> use<00:01:54.420> UAV<00:01:54.930> on<00:01:55.020> my<00:01:55.140> warfare<00:01:55.500> two

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
don't normally use UAV on my warfare two

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.649 
don't normally use UAV on my warfare two
so<00:01:55.920> I<00:01:55.979> forget<00:01:56.250> that<00:01:56.430> I've<00:01:56.490> got<00:01:56.640> it<00:01:56.820> and<00:01:57.540> then

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
so I forget that I've got it and then

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.300 
so I forget that I've got it and then
you<00:01:57.750> get<00:01:57.869> artillery<00:01:58.290> and<00:01:58.530> that<00:01:58.950> brings<00:01:59.159> me

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
you get artillery and that brings me

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.520 
you get artillery and that brings me
nicely<00:01:59.520> onto<00:02:00.090> another<00:02:00.689> reason<00:02:01.170> why<00:02:01.290> I<00:02:01.320> just

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
nicely onto another reason why I just

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.889 
nicely onto another reason why I just
cannot<00:02:01.799> get<00:02:01.979> on<00:02:02.130> this<00:02:02.369> game<00:02:02.579> and<00:02:03.119> that<00:02:03.180> is<00:02:03.659> the

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
cannot get on this game and that is the

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.770 
cannot get on this game and that is the
artillery<00:02:04.380> strike<00:02:04.770> it<00:02:05.149> really<00:02:06.149> pisses<00:02:06.479> me<00:02:06.750> off

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
artillery strike it really pisses me off

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.800 
artillery strike it really pisses me off
for<00:02:07.020> me<00:02:07.280> and<00:02:08.280> now<00:02:08.429> in<00:02:08.640> the<00:02:08.670> olden<00:02:08.849> times<00:02:09.450> where

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
for me and now in the olden times where

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.729 
for me and now in the olden times where
then<00:02:10.280> when<00:02:11.280> the<00:02:11.400> war<00:02:11.610> was<00:02:11.640> going<00:02:11.819> on<00:02:12.150> like<00:02:12.390> this

00:02:12.729 --> 00:02:12.739 
then when the war was going on like this

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:15.199 
then when the war was going on like this
there<00:02:13.739> was<00:02:13.950> a<00:02:14.190> thing<00:02:14.520> called<00:02:14.580> artillery

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209 
there was a thing called artillery

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:17.240 
there was a thing called artillery
strike<00:02:15.510> and<00:02:15.720> they<00:02:15.810> were<00:02:15.900> drop<00:02:16.140> bombs<00:02:16.560> I'm<00:02:16.980> not

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
strike and they were drop bombs I'm not

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:18.500 
strike and they were drop bombs I'm not
explain<00:02:17.640> history<00:02:17.970> I'm<00:02:18.060> just<00:02:18.209> saying<00:02:18.420> I<00:02:18.480> know

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
explain history I'm just saying I know

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.870 
explain history I'm just saying I know
it's<00:02:18.840> true<00:02:19.110> but<00:02:19.980> I<00:02:20.160> think<00:02:20.489> in<00:02:20.580> a<00:02:20.670> game<00:02:20.700> like

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
it's true but I think in a game like

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.290 
it's true but I think in a game like
this<00:02:21.090> it<00:02:22.020> gets<00:02:22.410> a<00:02:22.770> little<00:02:23.459> bit<00:02:23.670> frustrating

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
this it gets a little bit frustrating

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:25.940 
this it gets a little bit frustrating
that<00:02:24.390> there's<00:02:24.599> five<00:02:24.810> kills<00:02:25.140> isn't<00:02:25.680> hard<00:02:25.890> to

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
that there's five kills isn't hard to

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.800 
that there's five kills isn't hard to
get<00:02:26.220> especially<00:02:26.849> if<00:02:27.269> you're<00:02:27.360> using<00:02:27.390> them<00:02:27.780> for

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
get especially if you're using them for

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.550 
get especially if you're using them for
40<00:02:28.290> juggernaut<00:02:28.739> and<00:02:29.300> and<00:02:30.300> the<00:02:31.230> thing<00:02:31.440> I<00:02:31.530> hate

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
40 juggernaut and and the thing I hate

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.620 
40 juggernaut and and the thing I hate
about<00:02:31.769> the<00:02:32.130> until<00:02:32.340> you<00:02:32.400> are<00:02:32.580> taloosh<00:02:32.970> strike

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
about the until you are taloosh strike

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:36.949 
about the until you are taloosh strike
is<00:02:33.930> that<00:02:34.349> it<00:02:34.860> shakes<00:02:35.220> your<00:02:35.519> screen<00:02:35.970> constantly

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
is that it shakes your screen constantly

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:40.430 
is that it shakes your screen constantly
and<00:02:37.319> I<00:02:38.220> can't<00:02:38.670> play<00:02:39.390> this<00:02:39.660> game<00:02:39.900> for<00:02:40.110> more<00:02:40.319> than

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
and I can't play this game for more than

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.020 
and I can't play this game for more than
half<00:02:40.500> now<00:02:40.920> without<00:02:41.190> getting<00:02:41.519> a<00:02:41.580> fucking

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
half now without getting a fucking

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:43.699 
half now without getting a fucking
headache<00:02:42.330> because<00:02:42.630> the<00:02:42.989> screen<00:02:43.380> just<00:02:43.620> goes

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
headache because the screen just goes

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:46.910 
headache because the screen just goes
crazy<00:02:43.950> alike<00:02:44.640> but<00:02:45.060> here<00:02:45.560> everywhere<00:02:46.560> you<00:02:46.739> go

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
crazy alike but here everywhere you go

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.970 
crazy alike but here everywhere you go
the<00:02:47.400> screen<00:02:47.760> light<00:02:48.209> just<00:02:48.510> completely<00:02:48.980> bounces

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
the screen light just completely bounces

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.670 
the screen light just completely bounces
up<00:02:50.069> and<00:02:50.160> down<00:02:50.299> flashes<00:02:51.299> and<00:02:51.569> it<00:02:51.690> kills<00:02:52.140> my<00:02:52.410> head

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
up and down flashes and it kills my head

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.280 
up and down flashes and it kills my head
and<00:02:53.180> so<00:02:54.180> that's<00:02:54.330> another<00:02:54.599> reason<00:02:54.840> why<00:02:54.989> I<00:02:55.080> just

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
and so that's another reason why I just

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.170 
and so that's another reason why I just
don't<00:02:55.440> pass<00:02:55.620> game<00:02:55.920> because<00:02:56.280> you<00:02:56.940> know<00:02:57.060> it

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
don't pass game because you know it

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:58.339 
don't pass game because you know it
gives<00:02:57.269> me<00:02:57.450> a<00:02:57.480> headache<00:02:57.540> what<00:02:57.989> why<00:02:58.170> don't<00:02:58.230> you

00:02:58.339 --> 00:02:58.349 
gives me a headache what why don't you

00:02:58.349 --> 00:02:59.330 
gives me a headache what why don't you
want<00:02:58.470> to<00:02:58.530> play<00:02:58.560> a<00:02:58.709> game<00:02:58.769> that<00:02:59.069> gives<00:02:59.190> you<00:02:59.310> a

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
want to play a game that gives you a

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.930 
want to play a game that gives you a
headache<00:02:59.430> and<00:03:01.160> again<00:03:02.160> like<00:03:02.340> the<00:03:02.489> mp40

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
headache and again like the mp40

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:06.110 
headache and again like the mp40

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
situation I always thought treyarch

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.780 
situation I always thought treyarch
