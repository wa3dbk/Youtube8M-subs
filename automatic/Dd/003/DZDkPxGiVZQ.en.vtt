00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:18.080
 a surprise is a perfect evening 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:34.460
 tonight and we are we are really all 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:35.840
 happy with them coming home at 11 am 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.550
 from kickoff naim sliti us 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.449
 welcome home a full season 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:39.949
 with the red star 

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:41.210
 it needed seven 

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:43.430
 attackers to be reborn from his ashes 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:45.710
 after a journey already fraught with pitfalls 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:47.089
 at just 22 years old who weaves and 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:48.680
 four matches played as 

00:00:47.089 --> 00:00:49.070
 replacing last season in paris 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.989
 fc 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.040
 this year the former sedan player to 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:53.930
 regain a status of holder 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:56.089
 indisputable to the red star 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:57.229
 it is now six goals scored 

00:00:56.089 --> 00:00:59.210
 under the Rhone colors 

00:00:57.229 --> 00:01:02.119
 in the morning of the climb he is conscious 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:03.820
 lucky to evolve in this team 

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:06.740
 after resumed last year anyway 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:08.720
 I am I questioned myself 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:10.790
 myself because that things 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.490
 do not happen by chance and I got 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:14.990
 the chance to bounce back to the red star on 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.000
 with steve marlet 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.740
 we thought it was the 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.040
 best thing for me my parents so 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:23.750
 I had consulted my father and suddenly 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.390
 so that 's going very well I'm 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:29.060
 in a good team and for now 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:30.829
 the first so everything is why here 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:34.460
 it's more about the continuity of what 

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:36.200
 I was doing in sedan because I see there 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.860
 I find my feelings I play I 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.439
 a coach who makes me a lot 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:41.600
 trust and it's more important for 

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:42.259
 me for a player a little creative we have 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.390
 need to trust 

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:46.009
 here I find them what is good 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.869
 it's like there is a pretty good 

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:49.220
 atmosphere everyone gets along well and 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:52.149
 that's what also makes 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.149
 results follow 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.709
 Porsche arrived in Paris in 2013 

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:58.250
 naim has been slow to adapt to his 

00:01:57.709 --> 00:02:00.409
 new life 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:01.940
 accustomed to the calm die for it 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:04.280
 discovered the frantic pace of 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:06.470
 capital the difficulties that occurred 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:09.679
 added to moments of doubt in his 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:11.239
 young footballer career admits you 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:13.230
 that it's not forced to tubes of 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:16.200
 the internet because 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:18.780
 change of pace 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:21.590
 especially outdoors 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.590
 conclusion of a survey 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.910
 a quiet little town and there to 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:25.910
 Paris

 it was dynamic people they are 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:31.390
 dynamic and 15 people did not 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:34.480

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:36.130
 a cap I promise you I 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.130
 regret in any case it's a year 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:39.230
 law 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:41.210

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:49.090
 destiny 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:49.090
 so we'll accept it for sure 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.490
 it reverberates and fairs and 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:55.950
 Hockey Staff Act Conventions 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:56.670
 it did not work pushing out it's 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.740
 a bit difficult 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.990
 honestly I could not see 

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:04.230
 paris and drawing is more than you 

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:05.820
 have noticed that it's happening but mel 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:08.100
 from marseille quickly 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:09.630
 integrated to bauer thanks to the 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:11.040
 support of experienced players to 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:12.540
 the picture of samuel allegro 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.700
 in the locker room he also 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:16.800
 found sedan elders on the 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.900
 field as well as outside all praise his 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:22.110
 qualities am someone properly 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.970
 simple to live everyday that it flows 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:27.030
 source is someone adorable 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:30.420
 since a very simple humblot at 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:32.040
 someone who reserves me and so we 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:34.230
 has the impression that he is not there but he 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:38.460
 is there and then here is someone who has 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:40.230
 brought his stone to the building moment 

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:42.840
 of intimacy for the group preparing a 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:44.640
 decisive match against istres that of the 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.500
 climb in league 2 yet no question 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:49.710
 for naive to inflict any 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:53.280
 pressure on this kind of meeting where 

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:54.989
 causes a war and kill her judge 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.489
 concentrate before my match but 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:58.290
 I try to give the best of myself 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:04:00.510
 even on every month personally 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:02.670
 I like games like that with the 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:03.890
 that some fervor we feel very 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:06.110
 well we 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:07.340
 we also feel that it's a match like 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:10.130
 the others it's a particular match 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:12.590
 because we know that if we win we will 

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:29.240
 in league 2 honestly that's all going 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:30.770
 well, we prepare ourselves honestly 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:31.970
 pleased to see so many people 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:35.419
 around the stadium 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:37.760
 it feels the professionalism that's 

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:39.290
 accused was known that in league 2 and then we 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:42.200
 feels we approach gradually game 

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:43.870
 of the objective our means all that is okay 

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:46.400
 give me even more dandy for 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:48.530
 make a big game especially at least 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:50.930
 put the envi after a big match on 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:53.270
 hope you do it this will not be the case 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:55.430
 of some masters - the envi 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:58.190
 and all the determination that match 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:59.690
 like that that's what it's asking for but 

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:02.630
 it's not because you put cameras 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:05.030
 we need to ignite or start 

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:06.830
 to play our game our days our game 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:11.470
 as I know if I mark you if I 

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:11.470
 can make passes with pleasure 

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:22.550
 90 minutes to reconnect with the 

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:24.139
 naim professionalism remains the same 

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:26.150
 concentrated but serene 

00:05:24.139 --> 00:05:28.160
 whoever refuses to talk about revenge 

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:29.740
 on his journey was still that 

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:32.030
 this season has allowed him to rebound 

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:34.220

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:35.240
 it is the meeting of all the successes 

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:37.760
 for number 13 

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:40.310
 all under the look of a ter who has 

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:43.190
 always believed in him 

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:46.820
 naive he showed he was able to 

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:48.800
