is when it comes to female figure

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.260 
is when it comes to female figure
sometimes<00:02:48.930> my<00:02:49.290> DC<00:02:49.590> direct<00:02:49.980> it's<00:02:50.850> like<00:02:51.090> they

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:51.270 
sometimes my DC direct it's like they

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:56.990 
sometimes my DC direct it's like they
they<00:02:51.570> make<00:02:51.780> the<00:02:51.900> legs<00:02:52.140> a<00:02:52.290> little<00:02:52.560> too<00:02:56.000> narrow

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
they make the legs a little too narrow

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.340 
they make the legs a little too narrow
and<00:02:57.480> close<00:02:57.870> to<00:02:58.080> each<00:02:58.230> other<00:02:58.470> that<00:03:00.350> sometimes

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 
and close to each other that sometimes

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:04.370

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:08.260 
it's difficult to stand up on its own
with<00:03:04.680> that<00:03:04.709> not<00:03:05.610> putting<00:03:05.910> her<00:03:06.000> onto<00:03:06.270> a<00:03:06.330> stand

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:08.270

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:16.769 
overall scale 1 to 10 I'd definitely

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:21.979 
overall scale 1 to 10 I'd definitely
give<00:03:16.860> this<00:03:16.950> figure<00:03:17.340> Oh<00:03:18.110> a<00:03:19.110> 7<00:03:20.810> lack<00:03:21.810> of

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
give this figure Oh a 7 lack of

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:24.020 
give this figure Oh a 7 lack of
articulation<00:03:22.650> brings<00:03:22.860> it<00:03:23.010> down<00:03:23.160> to<00:03:23.220> a<00:03:23.370> 7<00:03:23.670> but

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
articulation brings it down to a 7 but

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:27.290 
articulation brings it down to a 7 but
the<00:03:24.060> detail<00:03:24.620> is<00:03:25.620> what<00:03:25.950> still<00:03:26.760> makes<00:03:26.970> it<00:03:27.090> a<00:03:27.150> good

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:27.300
