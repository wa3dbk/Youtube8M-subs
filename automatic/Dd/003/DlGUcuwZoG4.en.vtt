00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.680
 I present Raffaella Milandri thanks for 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:10.070
 being here a girl very raffaella 

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:12.690
 particular because it presents a lot 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:16.619
 pretty elegant or like a skirt 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:18.420
 short in short when in reality it is not that 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.510
 is not so for heaven's sake is 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.850
 certainly so a great traveler 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.189
 is a girl that we have always been 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.650
 seeing these images that always 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:32.369
 love to travel, let's call them a bit 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:35.730
 unusual a bit extreme where she succeeds 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:39.390
 to have contact with some 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:41.219
 let's call them ethnic minorities so he had 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.030
 made a trip where he met the 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.030
 pygmies 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.530
 in short, the indigenous peoples have always been you 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.649
 they remained in the heart 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:54.180
 yes it is true but for what reason this 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:57.600
 predilection but then the reason 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.609
 main and I read comics when I was little 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.920
 in short, that the comics have to do with and 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.329
 there were Indians with tex uil ha 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.760
 so let's talk about the American Indians 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.860
 when I was little and when I was 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.780
 met obviously just started 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.270
 travel I went to 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:15.150
 in Indian reservations when I have 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.890
 met these these peoples who are 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:21.270
 been subjected to all types 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:23.880
 possible harassment of violence and I have 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:27.240
 discovered that they really have a big one 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:30.140
 spirituality that still remains afterwards 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.700
 all these hundreds of years and then 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:34.350
 after a people I went to visit the 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.399
 bushmen then I went to see the 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.119
 pygmies 

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:40.619
 and now it has become a reason for me 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:43.470
 journey that is the proper fact of 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.960
 gather appeals and do 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.030
 research to find out which 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.880
 year problems and try to spread them 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.950
 say it seems very valuable to me 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.060
 precious and from what I know why 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.729
 obviously we are going to 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.500
 look around for friends who travel there 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.360
 come to find the most moment 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.479
 it was not difficult to meet with the 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:06.330
 bears but when she was alone 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:08.369
 in the car on a flat street 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:10.560
 slowly I started to sink 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:13.920
 what does this mean as one can 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.190
 road sinking then I was on 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.460
 from here 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:20.440
 particle image then high my way 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:25.680
 it's a challenge among motorists then 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:28.090
 I don't get caught when I don't pick up 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.340
 missions not for indigenous peoples 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.900
 more reckless wind because I'm not 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.880
 doing something for others but I'm doing it 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:35.800
 doing so is by myself 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:37.810
 crossed by dalton away I am 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:39.100
 arrived to produce bay then where there is 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:42.100
 just the arctic ocean 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:43.930
 I came back looking for photos 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:47.260
 they left early in the morning and 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:50.260
 I crossed a river and permafrost 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:52.000
 is the bottom of the say at the bottom of the 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:55.060
 river began to become type 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.620
 quicksands the car sank 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:58.780
 that is, it is blocked and then started 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:01.480
 enter the water from your were you alone 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:03.940
 in the middle of nowhere the nearest town 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:06.690
 how many kilometers and two hundred 700 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.690
 kilometres
