functional GPS tracking for multi sports
so<00:00:36.640> it<00:00:36.730> was<00:00:36.879> like<00:00:37.030> a<00:00:37.059> credit<00:00:37.300> line<00:00:37.480> mode<00:00:37.750> as

00:00:38.009 --> 00:00:38.019 
so it was like a credit line mode as

00:00:38.019 --> 00:00:40.919 
so it was like a credit line mode as
well<00:00:38.140> as<00:00:38.199> money<00:00:38.649> or<00:00:38.859> even<00:00:39.420> skiing<00:00:40.420> running

when<00:00:48.699> it<00:00:48.789> comes<00:00:48.969> to<00:00:49.829> battery<00:00:50.829> life

00:00:51.029 --> 00:00:51.039 
when it comes to battery life

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:52.560 
when it comes to battery life
I<00:00:51.309> think<00:00:51.730> this<00:00:51.820> watch<00:00:51.969> does<00:00:52.269> a<00:00:52.300> pretty<00:00:52.480> good

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:52.570 
I think this watch does a pretty good

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:57.150 
I think this watch does a pretty good
job<00:00:53.280> it<00:00:54.280> claims<00:00:54.699> a<00:00:55.089> 5-week<00:00:56.019> watch<00:00:56.829> mode

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:57.160 
job it claims a 5-week watch mode

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.630 
job it claims a 5-week watch mode
battery<00:00:57.519> life<00:00:57.699> which<00:00:57.940> is<00:00:58.149> pretty<00:00:58.660> solid<00:00:59.640> 50

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:00.640 
battery life which is pretty solid 50

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:05.580 
battery life which is pretty solid 50
hours<00:01:00.969> in<00:01:01.329> GPS<00:01:02.320> tracking<00:01:02.589> on<00:01:02.890> low<00:01:04.590> low

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:05.590 
hours in GPS tracking on low low

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:07.830 
hours in GPS tracking on low low
tracking<00:01:06.040> and<00:01:06.220> then<00:01:06.640> I<00:01:06.670> believe<00:01:07.150> it's<00:01:07.300> around

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:07.840 
tracking and then I believe it's around

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:13.470 
tracking and then I believe it's around
20<00:01:08.110> hours<00:01:08.140> of<00:01:11.580> high<00:01:12.580> resolution<00:01:12.730> tracking

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:13.480 
20 hours of high resolution tracking

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:17.100 
20 hours of high resolution tracking
when<00:01:14.320> it<00:01:14.410> comes<00:01:14.560> to<00:01:14.650> charging<00:01:15.780> you<00:01:16.780> need<00:01:16.930> this

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:17.110 
when it comes to charging you need this

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:20.520 
when it comes to charging you need this
cable<00:01:17.620> here<00:01:17.890> that<00:01:18.540> attaches<00:01:19.540> to<00:01:19.750> the<00:01:20.200> back<00:01:20.350> of

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:20.530 
cable here that attaches to the back of

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:24.510 
cable here that attaches to the back of
the<00:01:20.590> watch<00:01:21.120> I<00:01:22.120> wish<00:01:22.510> it<00:01:22.660> was<00:01:22.890> USB<00:01:23.890> so<00:01:24.280> I<00:01:24.340> didn't

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:24.520 
the watch I wish it was USB so I didn't

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:25.740 
the watch I wish it was USB so I didn't
have<00:01:24.610> to<00:01:24.700> carry<00:01:24.880> another<00:01:25.090> cable<00:01:25.300> everywhere<00:01:25.720> I

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:25.750 
have to carry another cable everywhere I

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:27.540 
have to carry another cable everywhere I
want<00:01:25.990> but<00:01:26.350> they<00:01:26.800> do<00:01:26.860> this<00:01:27.010> because<00:01:27.220> of

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:27.550 
want but they do this because of

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:31.200 
want but they do this because of
waterproofing<00:01:29.550> so<00:01:30.550> to<00:01:30.640> go<00:01:30.760> through<00:01:30.790> some<00:01:31.120> of

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:31.210 
waterproofing so to go through some of

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:33.600 
waterproofing so to go through some of
the<00:01:31.270> functions<00:01:31.630> of<00:01:31.720> the<00:01:31.810> watch<00:01:31.990> just<00:01:32.410> like<00:01:33.370> any

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:33.610 
the functions of the watch just like any

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:37.620 
the functions of the watch just like any
other<00:01:33.790> watch<00:01:34.630> here<00:01:35.070> it<00:01:36.070> was<00:01:36.190> your<00:01:36.310> time<00:01:36.580> I<00:01:36.970> have

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:37.630 
other watch here it was your time I have

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:40.620 
other watch here it was your time I have
it<00:01:37.720> set<00:01:37.930> up<00:01:38.080> so<00:01:38.320> that<00:01:38.440> my<00:01:38.710> hotkey<00:01:39.520> is<00:01:40.090> my

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:40.630 
it set up so that my hotkey is my

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:47.080 
it set up so that my hotkey is my
stopwatch

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.090 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:56.480 

pretty<00:01:48.090> nice

compass<00:02:05.610> the<00:02:06.610> time<00:02:06.790> again<00:02:07.500> and<00:02:09.270> then<00:02:10.270> when<00:02:10.600> I

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:10.630 
compass the time again and then when I

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:12.720 
compass the time again and then when I
want<00:02:10.869> to<00:02:10.960> start<00:02:11.170> an<00:02:11.260> activity<00:02:11.410> I<00:02:11.860> can<00:02:12.250> just<00:02:12.670> hit

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
the start button and then this is the

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.900 
the start button and then this is the
list<00:02:19.720> of<00:02:19.930> all<00:02:20.140> of<00:02:20.590> the<00:02:21.400> different<00:02:21.700> activities

being something to do all these things

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:49.010 
being something to do all these things
is<00:02:44.610> great<00:02:45.180> it<00:02:45.959> also<00:02:46.110> has<00:02:46.440> the<00:02:47.069> ability<00:02:47.280> to<00:02:48.020> give

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
is great it also has the ability to give

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:54.170 
is great it also has the ability to give
you<00:02:49.050> a<00:02:50.090> GPS<00:02:51.170> coordinate<00:02:52.170> up<00:02:52.319> to<00:02:53.030> 12<00:02:54.030> feet

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
you a GPS coordinate up to 12 feet

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:55.820 
you a GPS coordinate up to 12 feet
resolution<00:02:54.930> which<00:02:55.080> is<00:02:55.110> pretty<00:02:55.440> great<00:02:55.560> for

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830 
resolution which is pretty great for

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:59.479 
resolution which is pretty great for
something<00:02:56.790> this<00:02:57.030> small<00:02:57.620> the<00:02:58.620> temperature<00:02:59.160> I

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
something this small the temperature I

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:02.540 
something this small the temperature I
notice<00:03:00.420> is<00:03:00.750> not<00:03:01.260> the<00:03:01.590> best<00:03:01.980> when<00:03:02.250> it's<00:03:02.370> on<00:03:02.520> your

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:02.550 
notice is not the best when it's on your
