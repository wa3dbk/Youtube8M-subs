00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.259
 hello how about you guys welcome to this 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:06.259
 review of one piece 760 we started 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.279
 this chapter was quite interesting 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.140
 because good at the beginning we see how the 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.419
 around light and really do not 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.910
 it caused a lot of damage to the flamingo and we see such 

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:30.150
 time the potential that this has 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:32.250
 character we also see as first 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.710
 fugit now also bets on lutfi 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.410
 to defeat the flamingo as well as 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.900
 the rich and good king who currently already 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.150
 are not endangered by the 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:44.400
 catches of this we see also a little 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:46.920
 about the personality of sao what good 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:49.199
 it's quite similar to hers and it's 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.540
 similar to lucid's in terms of good 

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:54.989
 also has a person a woman in 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:57.629
 this case which shouts it in style 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.549
 navy but in the case of 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.199
 revolutionaries we also see something 

00:00:59.549 --> 00:01:03.540
 quite interesting on the cover that 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:06.270
 it's jinbei, well, I suppose in some 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:09.990
 moment will come to see pink that good 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:12.720
 he's been reading news for 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.940
 manga time but nevertheless 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.040
 I think it's going to appear at some point 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:19.410
 one of the most important parts of 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.960
 today's manga that I thought was pretty 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:23.640
 good was a good one as I say 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:27.090
 the potential that we have flamengo as 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:29.670
 character and also 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:32.670
 how macabre he has had since childhood 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.469
 because good in three simple vignettes is 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.210
 has shown something about the past of this 

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:39.659
 character and it really was pretty 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:42.689
 I was strange as 19 years old when 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:44.670
 this happened and then a possible reason for 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:47.280
 that he has done it is for the death of his 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.709
 mother because of her father or good at 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.569
 conditions that he believed favorable for the 

00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:53.640
 human life or good at least for 

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:55.500
 that kingdom of flamingo also mentioned 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:59.220
 related to the celestial dragons 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:03.390
 and the good ones are they are irritated at 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:06.630
 this case and they say they are about him 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:09.599
 about his nobility that good is a noble 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:12.390
 world and, as you already know, 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:15.540
 lutfi shit this and he's worth shit 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:19.470
 so maybe it's like that 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:22.410
 power up in the next chapter and such is 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:24.660
 at least I can give you good guys yo 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.819
 I think this is for the video today 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.980
 been enough can comment on what 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:31.170
 it seemed this chapter and this video 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.700
 They can give you like to share it for their 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.210
 social networks with your friends or the 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.550
