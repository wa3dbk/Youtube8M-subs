guy again and I might buy some ammo for
my<00:04:56.979> VSD<00:04:57.819> so<00:04:58.469> here<00:04:59.469> we<00:04:59.620> go<00:05:00.270> spend<00:05:01.270> as<00:05:01.360> much<00:05:01.509> as<00:05:01.690> I

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:01.780 
my VSD so here we go spend as much as I

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:04.619 
my VSD so here we go spend as much as I
can<00:05:02.080> and<00:05:02.289> I'll<00:05:03.009> leave<00:05:03.280> my<00:05:03.460> money<00:05:03.699> in<00:05:03.879> about<00:05:04.120> 25

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:16.740 
show you guys and I'm going to make my
way<00:05:15.610> back<00:05:15.969> to<00:05:16.000> the<00:05:16.240> point<00:05:16.479> that<00:05:16.569> we're<00:05:16.719> at

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:16.750 
way back to the point that we're at

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:18.749 
way back to the point that we're at
before<00:05:17.319> because<00:05:18.099> I<00:05:18.310> haven't<00:05:18.610> actually

00:05:18.749 --> 00:05:18.759 
before because I haven't actually

00:05:18.759 --> 00:05:20.999 
before because I haven't actually
recorded<00:05:19.389> part<00:05:19.569> 13<00:05:19.990> yet<00:05:20.199> and<00:05:20.409> I'd<00:05:20.560> rather<00:05:20.740> have

00:05:20.999 --> 00:05:21.009 
recorded part 13 yet and I'd rather have

00:05:21.009 --> 00:05:22.920 
recorded part 13 yet and I'd rather have
some<00:05:21.190> better<00:05:21.340> weapons<00:05:21.669> and<00:05:21.849> stuff<00:05:22.060> so<00:05:22.810> I<00:05:22.840> think

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:22.930 
some better weapons and stuff so I think

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:25.350 
some better weapons and stuff so I think
this<00:05:23.110> is<00:05:23.169> the<00:05:23.319> right<00:05:23.469> thing<00:05:23.500> to<00:05:23.710> do<00:05:23.919> and<00:05:24.210> yes<00:05:25.210> so

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:25.360 
this is the right thing to do and yes so

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:27.179 
this is the right thing to do and yes so
we<00:05:25.479> got<00:05:25.599> the<00:05:25.689> revolver<00:05:26.169> we<00:05:26.289> got<00:05:26.439> the<00:05:26.560> vsv<00:05:26.979> we

00:05:27.179 --> 00:05:27.189 
we got the revolver we got the vsv we

00:05:27.189 --> 00:05:29.969 
we got the revolver we got the vsv we
got<00:05:27.340> the<00:05:27.490> electric<00:05:28.449> gun<00:05:29.050> then<00:05:29.319> forget<00:05:29.860> what
