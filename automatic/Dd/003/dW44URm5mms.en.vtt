00:01:55.769 --> 00:01:55.779 
remember the words are gonna be across

00:01:55.779 --> 00:01:57.269 
remember the words are gonna be across
the<00:01:55.810> top<00:01:56.169> this<00:01:56.439> is<00:01:56.529> a<00:01:56.560> picture<00:01:56.799> in<00:01:57.069> a<00:01:57.249> picture

00:01:57.269 --> 00:01:57.279 
the top this is a picture in a picture

00:01:57.279 --> 00:02:14.220 
the top this is a picture in a picture
yeah<00:01:57.969> yeah<00:02:12.510> on<00:02:13.510> the<00:02:13.630> other<00:02:13.780> side<00:02:13.959> of<00:02:13.989> the<00:02:14.110> log

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
yeah yeah on the other side of the log

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.140 
yeah yeah on the other side of the log
that<00:02:14.620> looks<00:02:14.830> funny<00:02:15.040> cuz<00:02:15.280> it<00:02:15.370> looks<00:02:15.520> like<00:02:15.670> two

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
that looks funny cuz it looks like two

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.720 
that looks funny cuz it looks like two
headlamps<00:02:16.599> looking<00:02:16.900> out<00:02:17.050> arruda<00:02:17.950> you<00:02:18.400> know<00:02:18.520> so

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
headlamps looking out arruda you know so

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:21.030 
headlamps looking out arruda you know so
how<00:02:18.970> does<00:02:19.030> it<00:02:19.390> I<00:02:19.660> guess<00:02:20.500> the<00:02:20.620> question<00:02:20.770> is

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
how does it I guess the question is

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.369 
how does it I guess the question is
where<00:02:21.400> is<00:02:21.580> the<00:02:21.610> name

00:02:23.369 --> 00:02:23.379 
where is the name

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:25.570 
where is the name
so<00:02:24.379> what<00:02:24.560> they<00:02:24.709> can<00:02:24.739> do<00:02:25.069> what<00:02:25.280> they<00:02:25.340> will

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
so what they can do what they will

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.630 
so what they can do what they will
probably<00:02:25.760> end<00:02:26.030> up<00:02:26.120> doing<00:02:26.510> is<00:02:26.870> they<00:02:27.230> can<00:02:28.069> like

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
probably end up doing is they can like

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.780 
probably end up doing is they can like
darken<00:02:29.590> like<00:02:30.590> darkened<00:02:31.069> down<00:02:31.280> from<00:02:31.519> the<00:02:31.610> top

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
darken like darkened down from the top

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:33.550 
darken like darkened down from the top
darken<00:02:32.300> up<00:02:32.450> from<00:02:32.750> the<00:02:32.870> bottom<00:02:33.050> so<00:02:33.379> that<00:02:33.410> the

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
darken up from the bottom so that the

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.430 
darken up from the bottom so that the
type<00:02:33.890> will<00:02:34.099> stand<00:02:34.489> out<00:02:34.730> from<00:02:35.209> it<00:02:35.390> so<00:02:36.110> they<00:02:36.260> can

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 
type will stand out from it so they can

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.530 
type will stand out from it so they can
mute<00:02:36.800> those<00:02:37.310> areas<00:02:37.760> back<00:02:38.030> so<00:02:38.239> there<00:02:38.390> might<00:02:38.510> be

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
mute those areas back so there might be
