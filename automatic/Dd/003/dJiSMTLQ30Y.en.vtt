00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:12.450
 all the canyon 

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:14.900
 I do not want to know the capacity of the 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.820
 capacity 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:20.349
 in the forces of boarding the shore of 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:20.349
 the doors down the water and the water 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:28.300
 because you get behind the wheel you press the 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:28.300
 hospital track 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:34.309
 good 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:37.160
 right now all the meat itself is below 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:39.440
 I do not know there they see three plates down in case 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.360
 that happens just what to do when 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.339
 hit all that the joke is that it's 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:47.120
 protected the gasoline tank case 

00:00:43.339 --> 00:00:50.710
 crankcase then those plates serve to 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.710
 This type of stones are the same 

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:55.000
 do not 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:01:02.440
 I'll be in suspension 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:04.130
 here for example if it turns around not the 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:06.720
 I'm going to give because 

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:10.070
 arm the track 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.070
 so the other the dead good 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.150
 What he wants is that when he is 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.150
 raining 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:31.140
 and again between changing the chassis of 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:36.360
 clothes with all the time you work everything 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:38.700
 the time there is the tire that is in 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.289
 the air to it is compressed to all 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.720
 wide is crooked I can open and 

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:45.180
 close the door closes and opens without 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.399
 problems there are many cars when they are 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:57.080
 in that kind of effort you can not open 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:57.080
 the door and the nato 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:07.100
 the grand cherokee 90 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:10.640
 4th 2000-2006 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.640
 the past 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:17.319
 yesterday we put once 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.760
 and the inclination of the goal 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:36.099
 It's because I love you so much 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:57.870
 well here 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:23.400
 because the wheels 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:32.130
 8 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:41.680
 the engine and the box and obviously the 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:44.590
 differentials are going to help us lower 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:46.000
 smooth without having an accident or anything 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:48.250
 and be able to follow the control of the car 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.440
 many years are going to move the wheel in the 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:52.340
 down because 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:52.340
 I have to correct 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:58.680
 I can move it and without problems and 

00:03:56.570 --> 00:04:03.080
 let's hope we get to the other side without 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:03.080
 crash then tell me 

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:08.390
 the lid 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:20.720
 As you can see, there is always control of 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:20.720
 vehicle and there's 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.500
 here is a closed loop 

00:04:50.539 --> 00:04:55.860
 we never lose the balance of the card 

00:04:53.789 --> 00:04:57.780
 in control of the card 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:00.539
 here you could see the same thing you have to 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:02.650
 to go down without braking if brakes ended 

00:05:00.539 --> 00:05:05.190
 the walls 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:07.880
 no no 

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:07.880
 for all 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:12.200
 this
