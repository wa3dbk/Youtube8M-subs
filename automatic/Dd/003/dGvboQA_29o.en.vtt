00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:12.960
 yes 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:16.200
 Well, I'm going to tell you about the 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.869
 16 and the 16 sets that are devices 

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:20.790
 which they are very beautiful and you see have 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.500
 seen with my partner his long 

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:24.750
 main design but I'm going to 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.140
 focus on performance because they are 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.520
 terminals that incorporate technology 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:31.829
 Sancho's most advanced copper did it 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:35.040
 as the result of years of research and 

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:37.200
 ibar the first of the points from which 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.180
 let's talk is the processor so much 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.149
 galaxy 6 as galaxy 66 they carry a 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.609
 64-bit processor and they are made in 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:47.100
 technology and 14 nanometers that means 

00:00:44.609 --> 00:00:49.410
 64 bits means that they are capable of 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.870
 process very large data volumes 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.010
 a powerful processor up to core capable 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.399
 to process very large volumes of data 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.510
 large and 14 nanometers means that 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.640
 is done against the stories of very 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.589
 little ones that have a consumption of 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.199
 very low energy that does not heat up and 

00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:05.640
 which is therefore very efficient that 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.560
 we need good so if we have 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.550
 processors powerful processors 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.710
 what they are doing is accessing 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:12.810
 continuously to memory to leave and 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.280
 to collect data 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.850
 we're going to need very memories too 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.430
 special 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:21.030
 in honor of the whole why so much galaxy 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:23.790
 s 6 as a galaxy s is set what 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:28.280
 they have are memories 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:32.010
 vcs 2.0 that are very efficient are 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:34.470
 they stand out for their performance and also 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:35.940
 for its low consumption with this what 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.570
 we will be able to get is with 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:41.010
 applications such as streaming 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:44.060
 let's see a video on youtube that 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:46.270
 have a good resolution we select 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.159
 1440 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:50.040
 and here what we are doing is good 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:52.380
 he has not taken my 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.820
 the maximum quality the application of 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.680
 youtube we are going to select the other time 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.210
 so that the server does not now 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.740
 served the youtube is sending the pass 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.770
 beyond fixing or we are 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.329
 playing a youtube video 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.189
 that we are downloading through the 

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:06.140
 4g signal in this case we have very 

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:07.969
 little coverage we have two lines of 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:11.030
 coverage nothing more so here 

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:13.910
 we have in use then in the part of 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:15.349
 radio we have the use of the processor 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:17.720
 applications in the graphics processor 

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:20.150
 that is processing a very high video 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.920
 resolution and also access to that 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:25.549
 temporary memory where where they were 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:27.220
 where is this video in the experiment 

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:29.840
 we are watching a high quality video 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.610
 making a very very low consumption of 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.049
 battery in fact and be able to check it by 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:35.230
 yourself in finishing is not being 

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:35.230
 warming up 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:42.910
 if we talk a little about the screen 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:47.290
 we can see that we have a screen 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:51.250
 5 inches with super qhd resolution 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:54.160
 amoled this will allow us to have a 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:56.380
 pixel density per inch of 577 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.620
 which is very much as you can see it is not 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:58.620
 pixela 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:05.110
 although we expand and display mail that as 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.510
 you know in the company that qualifies the 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:09.790
 screens par excellence has recognized 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:12.220
 and the screen of the galaxy s 6 and galaxy s 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:15.040
 66 as the best screens in the 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:17.190
 world on a smartphone is also the 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:20.620
 fourth consecutive time we have this 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:22.540
 rating the other example also 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:24.600
 where the usability of the 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:26.820
 smart manager app set 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:28.920
 smart manager is an application that we 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:30.500
 will allow to optimize the resources of 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:34.080
 our system in terms of battery 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:35.760
 ram storage and security now in 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:38.970
 a single application if we select 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:40.890
 erase everything you are going to do then 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:42.360
 remove those processes that are in 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:43.820
 background that after all are 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:46.980
 making a battery consumption 

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:50.400
 unnecessary and good because it's going to 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:51.810
 optimize then that fluidity and that that 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.270
 performance that sometimes 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:56.040
 we need as easy as touching 

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:57.780
 is this option to erase everything and not 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.940
 have to individually to each of 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:01.500
 the resources through the menu and go 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:03.750
 using it 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:05.910
 It is also important that we talk about 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:07.530
 Safety is important because good in 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:09.360
 the the devices of these 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:10.680
 characteristics what is going to look for the 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:13.650
 company is that your data and your 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:15.270
 transactions are safe and what is going to 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:17.250
 also look for the user is that his 

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:20.180
 private part so keep private 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:22.520
 well, we have 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:24.139
 in this smart manager option of 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:26.090
 security we will be able to manage the 

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:28.370
 Device security on the one hand 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:31.310
 we have knox as you know it's not the 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:33.169
 samsung security solution for 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:35.600
 different platforms that we just 

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:37.970
 get the qualification of the solution 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:40.940
 safer in the latest edition of the 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:42.139
 mobile world congress of this year 2015 and 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:43.639
 what he's going to do is give us a 

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:46.460
 protection both at the hardware level 

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:48.229
 as at the software level of everything 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:50.960
 we have in the device and its 

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:53.690
 transactions is totally safe that 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:54.979
 We also have the certification of 

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:58.120
 security department of the 

00:04:54.979 --> 00:05:00.440
 Governments of the United States and the United Kingdom 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:03.410
 see how simple it is if we want 

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:05.030
 separate work and leisure we only have 

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:07.400
 to touch this option to install less 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:10.280
 and automatically we will have there 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:12.169
 divided into two environments the environment 

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:14.300
 personnel and the work environment 

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:17.240
 work environment would be entered touching 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:18.979
 this then this this icon names of 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:20.479
 security and here we see all the 

00:05:18.979 --> 00:05:21.860
 security applications so they are 

00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:24.490
 totally independent to those that 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:26.500
 we have in our personal part 

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:28.509
 besides all this and being able to make a 

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:30.669
 active protection that takes a little more 

00:05:28.509 --> 00:05:32.050
 beyond simply doing the division of 

00:05:30.669 --> 00:05:35.830
 our part person on our part 

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:38.860
 corporate because we have a protection 

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:41.110
 antimalware in this case that of mcafee and 

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:42.639
 what he's going to do is be analyzing in 

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:43.930
 real time for our entire system 

00:05:42.639 --> 00:05:45.250
 to ensure that no the 

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:47.470
 malware and if at a specific moment 

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:49.090
 We want to do a manual analysis 

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:52.020
 we just tap on this option to 

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:52.020
 make device
