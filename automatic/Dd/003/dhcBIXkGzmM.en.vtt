00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:14.100 

the<00:00:12.240> title<00:00:12.570> of<00:00:12.660> my

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:14.110 
the title of my

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:16.320 
the title of my
NPCs<00:00:14.650> now<00:00:15.129> originally<00:00:15.370> I<00:00:15.670> said<00:00:15.790> I'll<00:00:16.059> write<00:00:16.299> a

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:16.330 
NPCs now originally I said I'll write a

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:18.420 
NPCs now originally I said I'll write a
book<00:00:16.420> just<00:00:16.539> on<00:00:16.869> computer<00:00:17.289> repair<00:00:17.650> but<00:00:18.220> I<00:00:18.250> began

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:18.430 
book just on computer repair but I began

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:20.189 
book just on computer repair but I began
to<00:00:18.670> realize<00:00:19.029> that<00:00:19.060> if<00:00:19.449> you<00:00:19.539> were<00:00:19.570> repairing<00:00:20.020> a

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:20.199 
to realize that if you were repairing a

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:21.510 
to realize that if you were repairing a
system<00:00:20.560> that<00:00:20.710> was<00:00:20.830> more<00:00:21.039> than<00:00:21.160> a<00:00:21.189> few<00:00:21.369> months

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:21.520 
system that was more than a few months

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:23.880 
system that was more than a few months
old<00:00:21.849> the<00:00:22.360> technology<00:00:22.990> would<00:00:23.110> have<00:00:23.200> changed<00:00:23.500> so

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:23.890 
old the technology would have changed so

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:25.529 
old the technology would have changed so
much<00:00:24.160> that<00:00:24.610> you<00:00:24.730> weren't<00:00:24.849> really<00:00:25.000> just<00:00:25.329> doing

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:25.539 
much that you weren't really just doing

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:27.150 
much that you weren't really just doing
a<00:00:25.689> repair<00:00:26.050> you<00:00:26.289> were<00:00:26.410> also<00:00:26.680> doing<00:00:26.800> an<00:00:27.009> upgrade

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:27.160 
a repair you were also doing an upgrade

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.120 
a repair you were also doing an upgrade
so<00:00:27.869> the<00:00:28.869> concept<00:00:29.320> of<00:00:29.410> upgrading<00:00:30.009> and

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:30.130 
so the concept of upgrading and

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:31.409 
so the concept of upgrading and
repairing<00:00:30.160> are<00:00:30.610> really<00:00:30.820> essentially<00:00:31.329> the

00:00:31.409 --> 00:00:31.419 
repairing are really essentially the

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:32.270 
repairing are really essentially the
same<00:00:31.599> thing

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:32.280 
same thing

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:34.889 
same thing
now<00:00:33.280> when<00:00:33.460> dealing<00:00:33.640> with<00:00:33.790> the<00:00:34.120> upgrades<00:00:34.690> or

00:00:34.889 --> 00:00:34.899 
now when dealing with the upgrades or

00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:37.319 
now when dealing with the upgrades or
repairs<00:00:34.930> or<00:00:35.649> systems<00:00:36.399> in<00:00:36.520> general<00:00:36.550> basically

00:00:37.319 --> 00:00:37.329 
repairs or systems in general basically

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:39.450 
repairs or systems in general basically
have<00:00:37.660> three<00:00:37.809> wraps<00:00:38.110> to<00:00:38.350> go<00:00:38.500> number<00:00:39.190> one<00:00:39.340> you

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:39.460 
have three wraps to go number one you

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:40.799 
have three wraps to go number one you
can<00:00:39.610> take<00:00:39.760> a<00:00:39.820> system<00:00:40.300> that's<00:00:40.480> already

00:00:40.799 --> 00:00:40.809 
can take a system that's already

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:42.750 
can take a system that's already
existing<00:00:41.440> and<00:00:41.649> we<00:00:41.829> can<00:00:41.980> upgrade<00:00:42.190> it<00:00:42.399> that<00:00:42.640> is

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:42.760 
existing and we can upgrade it that is

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:44.250 
existing and we can upgrade it that is
improve<00:00:43.090> it<00:00:43.270> bring<00:00:43.480> it<00:00:43.600> up<00:00:43.690> to<00:00:43.870> modern

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:44.260 
improve it bring it up to modern

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:45.119 
improve it bring it up to modern
technology

00:00:45.119 --> 00:00:45.129 
technology

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:46.980 
technology
number<00:00:45.670> two<00:00:45.820> we<00:00:46.000> can<00:00:46.150> build<00:00:46.329> a<00:00:46.510> system<00:00:46.660> from

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:46.990 
number two we can build a system from

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:48.630 
number two we can build a system from
scratch<00:00:47.290> or<00:00:47.620> number<00:00:47.980> three<00:00:48.190> you<00:00:48.340> can<00:00:48.490> just

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:48.640 
scratch or number three you can just

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.819 
scratch or number three you can just
purchase<00:00:49.090> a<00:00:49.210> store-bought<00:00:49.690> system<00:00:50.200> let's

00:00:50.819 --> 00:00:50.829 
purchase a store-bought system let's

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:53.460 
purchase a store-bought system let's
examine<00:00:50.980> all<00:00:51.550> of<00:00:51.579> these<00:00:51.880> different<00:00:52.510> ways<00:00:53.290> of

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:53.470 
examine all of these different ways of

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:56.340 
examine all of these different ways of
going<00:00:53.620> about<00:00:53.829> things<00:00:54.720> number<00:00:55.720> one<00:00:55.989> as<00:00:56.140> far<00:00:56.170> as

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:56.350 
going about things number one as far as

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:58.860 
going about things number one as far as
an<00:00:56.500> upgrade<00:00:56.710> is<00:00:57.040> concerned<00:00:57.720> when<00:00:58.720> dealing

00:00:58.860 --> 00:00:58.870 
an upgrade is concerned when dealing

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:00.150 
an upgrade is concerned when dealing
with<00:00:59.140> an<00:00:59.260> upgrade<00:00:59.560> you're<00:00:59.710> normally<00:00:59.980> going<00:01:00.100> to

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:00.160 
with an upgrade you're normally going to

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:01.860 
with an upgrade you're normally going to
be<00:01:00.220> changing<00:01:00.700> the<00:01:00.730> processor<00:01:01.329> in<00:01:01.420> the<00:01:01.510> system

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:01.870 
be changing the processor in the system

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:04.469 
be changing the processor in the system
now<00:01:02.290> in<00:01:02.710> most<00:01:03.040> cases<00:01:03.399> in<00:01:03.760> virtually<00:01:04.119> all<00:01:04.149> cases

00:01:04.469 --> 00:01:04.479 
now in most cases in virtually all cases

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:06.630 
now in most cases in virtually all cases
that<00:01:04.720> is<00:01:05.049> the<00:01:05.530> motherboard<00:01:06.009> that's<00:01:06.430> in<00:01:06.520> your

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:06.640 
that is the motherboard that's in your

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:07.920 
that is the motherboard that's in your
system<00:01:06.939> that<00:01:07.090> will<00:01:07.270> not<00:01:07.420> accept<00:01:07.750> a<00:01:07.840> new

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:07.930 
system that will not accept a new

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:09.749 
system that will not accept a new
processor<00:01:08.470> so<00:01:08.920> you're<00:01:09.250> not<00:01:09.369> going<00:01:09.549> to<00:01:09.640> only

00:01:09.749 --> 00:01:09.759 
processor so you're not going to only

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:11.160 
processor so you're not going to only
replace<00:01:10.149> the<00:01:10.270> processor<00:01:10.750> you're<00:01:10.869> also<00:01:10.990> gonna

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:11.170 
replace the processor you're also gonna

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:12.600 
replace the processor you're also gonna
have<00:01:11.290> to<00:01:11.350> replace<00:01:11.649> the<00:01:11.770> motherboard<00:01:12.189> and<00:01:12.460> then

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:12.610 
have to replace the motherboard and then

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:13.920 
have to replace the motherboard and then
that<00:01:12.790> new<00:01:12.939> motherboard<00:01:13.390> is<00:01:13.479> going<00:01:13.600> to<00:01:13.659> require

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:13.930 
that new motherboard is going to require

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:15.480 
that new motherboard is going to require
a<00:01:13.990> different<00:01:14.290> type<00:01:14.469> of<00:01:14.590> memory<00:01:14.950> than<00:01:15.340> your

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:15.490 
a different type of memory than your

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:17.609 
a different type of memory than your
previous<00:01:15.670> motherboard<00:01:16.299> also<00:01:16.450> so<00:01:17.409> the

00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:17.619 
previous motherboard also so the

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:19.410 
previous motherboard also so the
essential<00:01:18.190> components<00:01:18.760> of<00:01:18.790> an<00:01:18.909> upgrade<00:01:19.030> are

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:19.420 
essential components of an upgrade are

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:22.410 
essential components of an upgrade are
processor<00:01:20.290> motherboard<00:01:20.560> and<00:01:21.100> RAM<00:01:21.340> now<00:01:22.240> with

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:22.420 
processor motherboard and RAM now with

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.300 
processor motherboard and RAM now with
prices<00:01:22.900> you<00:01:23.110> know<00:01:23.140> these<00:01:23.350> days<00:01:23.650> motherboards

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:24.310 
prices you know these days motherboards

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:26.550 
prices you know these days motherboards
are<00:01:24.430> around<00:01:24.640> 100<00:01:25.030> to<00:01:25.060> 150<00:01:25.720> dollars<00:01:26.110> you<00:01:26.440> can

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:26.560 
are around 100 to 150 dollars you can

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.530 
are around 100 to 150 dollars you can
get<00:01:26.650> a<00:01:26.710> reasonable<00:01:27.460> speed<00:01:27.580> processor<00:01:28.299> for

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:28.540 
get a reasonable speed processor for

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:32.399 
get a reasonable speed processor for
around<00:01:28.720> $200<00:01:29.560> or<00:01:29.710> so<00:01:29.890> and<00:01:30.190> then<00:01:31.060> memory<00:01:31.450> for

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:32.409 
around $200 or so and then memory for

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:34.140 
around $200 or so and then memory for
256<00:01:33.130> Meg's<00:01:33.430> which<00:01:33.640> would<00:01:33.790> be<00:01:33.909> the<00:01:34.030> minimum

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:34.150 
256 Meg's which would be the minimum

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:36.149 
256 Meg's which would be the minimum
amount<00:01:34.570> I'd<00:01:34.780> recommend<00:01:35.200> today<00:01:35.470> that's<00:01:35.950> going

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:36.159 
amount I'd recommend today that's going

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:38.280 
amount I'd recommend today that's going
for<00:01:36.340> about<00:01:36.490> $100<00:01:37.240> and<00:01:37.720> we're<00:01:37.869> talking<00:01:38.020> about

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:38.290 
for about $100 and we're talking about

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:41.910 
for about $100 and we're talking about
400<00:01:38.950> to<00:01:39.040> 450<00:01:39.670> dollars<00:01:39.970> for<00:01:40.750> a<00:01:41.080> typical<00:01:41.350> upgrade

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:41.920 
400 to 450 dollars for a typical upgrade

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:43.890 
400 to 450 dollars for a typical upgrade
now<00:01:42.850> the<00:01:42.909> thing<00:01:43.119> you<00:01:43.210> have<00:01:43.299> to<00:01:43.420> consider<00:01:43.510> is

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:43.900 
now the thing you have to consider is

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:45.179 
now the thing you have to consider is
that<00:01:44.020> the<00:01:44.140> upgrade<00:01:44.439> is<00:01:44.560> probably<00:01:44.920> not

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:45.189 
that the upgrade is probably not

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:47.039 
that the upgrade is probably not
worthwhile<00:01:45.490> but<00:01:46.090> it's<00:01:46.360> not<00:01:46.540> worth<00:01:46.720> to<00:01:46.930> spend

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:47.049 
worthwhile but it's not worth to spend

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:48.780

you<00:01:50.500> have<00:01:50.680> now<00:01:50.830> so<00:01:51.430> let's<00:01:51.640> say<00:01:51.760> for<00:01:51.790> example

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:52.360 
you have now so let's say for example

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.830 
you have now so let's say for example
you<00:01:52.570> had<00:01:52.840> a<00:01:53.280> Pentium<00:01:54.280> 4<00:01:54.610> and<00:01:55.060> it<00:01:55.420> was<00:01:55.540> running

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:55.840 
you had a Pentium 4 and it was running

you had a Pentium 4 and it was running
at<00:01:55.960> 1.6<00:01:56.650> gigahertz<00:01:57.100> and<00:01:57.490> you<00:01:58.270> decided<00:01:58.600> you

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:58.780 
at 1.6 gigahertz and you decided you

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.380 
at 1.6 gigahertz and you decided you

or<00:02:01.570> 2.0<00:02:02.080> gigahertz<00:02:02.409> that's<00:02:03.189> really<00:02:03.430> not

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:03.580 
or 2.0 gigahertz that's really not

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:05.730 
or 2.0 gigahertz that's really not
enough<00:02:03.790> of<00:02:04.210> an<00:02:04.330> upgrade<00:02:04.479> to<00:02:04.780> justify<00:02:05.259> you<00:02:05.710> know

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:24.460 
done with your upgrade and all of a
sudden<00:03:23.330> you<00:03:23.390> realize<00:03:23.420> you<00:03:23.810> know<00:03:23.930> the<00:03:24.230> hard

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:24.470 
sudden you realize you know the hard

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:26.530 
sudden you realize you know the hard
disk<00:03:24.710> that<00:03:24.770> I<00:03:24.890> have<00:03:25.130> really<00:03:25.520> is<00:03:25.640> not<00:03:26.060> adequate

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:26.540 
disk that I have really is not adequate

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:28.660 
disk that I have really is not adequate
I<00:03:26.690> need<00:03:27.080> a<00:03:27.110> bigger<00:03:27.320> hard<00:03:27.590> drive<00:03:27.650> so<00:03:28.310> now<00:03:28.460> you've

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:28.670 
I need a bigger hard drive so now you've

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:30.580 
I need a bigger hard drive so now you've
added<00:03:28.790> a<00:03:29.000> hard<00:03:29.180> drive<00:03:29.390> to<00:03:29.420> the<00:03:29.630> mix<00:03:29.840> and<00:03:30.440> you're

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590 
added a hard drive to the mix and you're

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:32.110 
added a hard drive to the mix and you're
replacing<00:03:31.100> the<00:03:31.160> hard<00:03:31.340> drive<00:03:31.520> as<00:03:31.670> well<00:03:31.850> and

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.120 
replacing the hard drive as well and

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:34.990 
replacing the hard drive as well and
maybe<00:03:33.020> the<00:03:33.320> existing<00:03:34.100> video<00:03:34.370> card<00:03:34.700> you<00:03:34.790> have

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:35.000 
maybe the existing video card you have

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.880 
maybe the existing video card you have
is<00:03:35.180> not<00:03:35.330> adequate<00:03:35.840> some<00:03:36.290> of<00:03:36.380> the<00:03:36.440> newer<00:03:36.650> games

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:36.890 
is not adequate some of the newer games

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:39.400 
is not adequate some of the newer games
or<00:03:37.460> I<00:03:37.730> know<00:03:37.910> high-end<00:03:38.390> applications<00:03:39.050> require

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:39.410 
or I know high-end applications require

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:41.260 
or I know high-end applications require
a<00:03:39.440> higher<00:03:39.740> performance<00:03:40.190> video<00:03:40.460> card<00:03:40.730> so<00:03:41.150> now

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:41.270 
a higher performance video card so now

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:43.020 
a higher performance video card so now
you're<00:03:41.420> adding<00:03:41.690> a<00:03:41.780> video<00:03:41.870> card<00:03:42.290> to<00:03:42.350> the<00:03:42.500> mix

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.030 
you're adding a video card to the mix

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:46.210 
you're adding a video card to the mix
and<00:03:44.030> maybe<00:03:44.330> your<00:03:44.570> existing<00:03:45.080> motherboard<00:03:45.830> you

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:46.220 
and maybe your existing motherboard you

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:47.740 
and maybe your existing motherboard you
know<00:03:46.310> didn't<00:03:46.610> have<00:03:46.700> a<00:03:46.760> built-in<00:03:47.120> network<00:03:47.330> and

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:47.750 
know didn't have a built-in network and

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:49.960 
know didn't have a built-in network and
now<00:03:47.840> you<00:03:47.900> decided<00:03:48.320> to<00:03:48.500> add<00:03:48.590> a<00:03:48.620> cable<00:03:49.040> modem<00:03:49.190> so

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:49.970 
now you decided to add a cable modem so

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:52.360 
now you decided to add a cable modem so
you<00:03:50.570> need<00:03:50.720> a<00:03:50.750> land<00:03:51.230> card<00:03:51.530> to<00:03:51.710> attach<00:03:52.010> to<00:03:52.250> the

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:52.370 
you need a land card to attach to the

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:54.460 
you need a land card to attach to the
system<00:03:52.700> so<00:03:52.850> now<00:03:53.000> you've<00:03:53.150> added<00:03:53.270> a<00:03:53.480> LAN<00:03:53.690> card<00:03:53.990> if

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:54.470 
system so now you've added a LAN card if

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:56.140 
system so now you've added a LAN card if
you<00:03:54.710> need<00:03:54.860> to<00:03:54.950> upgrade<00:03:55.280> the<00:03:55.400> sound<00:03:55.670> card<00:03:55.970> in

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:56.150 
you need to upgrade the sound card in

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:58.870 
you need to upgrade the sound card in
order<00:03:56.270> to<00:03:56.450> have<00:03:56.570> better<00:03:56.750> sound<00:03:57.610> by<00:03:58.610> the<00:03:58.640> time

00:03:58.870 --> 00:03:58.880 
order to have better sound by the time

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:00.400 
order to have better sound by the time
you<00:03:59.030> start<00:03:59.090> evaluating<00:03:59.750> all<00:04:00.110> the<00:04:00.140> things

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:00.410 
you start evaluating all the things

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:01.480 
you start evaluating all the things
you're<00:04:00.530> purchasing<00:04:00.920> you're<00:04:01.190> not<00:04:01.280> really

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:01.490 
you're purchasing you're not really

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:03.050 
upgrading your existing system you're

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:05.020 
upgrading your existing system you're
building<00:04:03.350> a<00:04:03.410> new<00:04:03.530> system<00:04:03.830> from<00:04:04.010> scratch<00:04:04.310> the

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:06.800 
only thing you're keeping is perhaps the

many of the newer processors for example

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:16.870 
many of the newer processors for example
are<00:04:14.150> extremely<00:04:14.630> power<00:04:14.810> hungry<00:04:15.080> I<00:04:15.730> call<00:04:16.730> this

the Frankenstein syndrome that's where
you<00:04:19.010> know<00:04:19.160> you<00:04:19.310> started<00:04:19.670> out<00:04:19.850> just<00:04:20.090> replacing

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:20.570 
you know you started out just replacing

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:21.849 
you know you started out just replacing
one<00:04:20.720> or<00:04:20.840> two<00:04:20.960> things<00:04:21.170> and<00:04:21.380> then<00:04:21.530> before<00:04:21.680> you

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:21.859 
one or two things and then before you

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:23.290 
one or two things and then before you
know<00:04:22.130> it<00:04:22.160> you've<00:04:22.400> built<00:04:22.670> yourself<00:04:22.820> a<00:04:23.180> new

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:23.300 
know it you've built yourself a new

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:25.630 
know it you've built yourself a new
system<00:04:23.630> from<00:04:23.810> scratch<00:04:24.080> now<00:04:24.920> the<00:04:24.980> only<00:04:25.190> problem

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:25.640 
system from scratch now the only problem

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:27.610 
system from scratch now the only problem
with<00:04:25.730> that<00:04:25.790> is<00:04:25.940> that<00:04:26.300> if<00:04:26.690> you<00:04:26.750> add<00:04:27.110> up<00:04:27.140> the

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:27.620 
with that is that if you add up the

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:29.950 
with that is that if you add up the
price<00:04:28.370> of<00:04:28.610> all<00:04:28.790> these<00:04:28.970> individual<00:04:29.450> components

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:29.960 
price of all these individual components

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:31.750 
price of all these individual components
you<00:04:30.020> purchased<00:04:30.440> one<00:04:30.500> at<00:04:30.800> a<00:04:30.890> time<00:04:31.100> piecemeal

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:31.760 
you purchased one at a time piecemeal

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:33.760 
you purchased one at a time piecemeal
and<00:04:32.000> then<00:04:32.480> the<00:04:32.600> amount<00:04:32.780> of<00:04:32.900> time<00:04:32.990> you<00:04:33.320> spend<00:04:33.620> on

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:33.770 
and then the amount of time you spend on

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:35.350 
and then the amount of time you spend on
it<00:04:33.919> all<00:04:34.040> you<00:04:34.580> will<00:04:34.669> have<00:04:34.730> spent<00:04:35.090> far<00:04:35.330> more

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:35.360 
it all you will have spent far more

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:37.930 
it all you will have spent far more
money<00:04:35.870> doing<00:04:36.380> that<00:04:36.560> than<00:04:37.070> simply<00:04:37.310> purchasing

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:37.940 
money doing that than simply purchasing

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:38.570 
money doing that than simply purchasing
a<00:04:38.060> new<00:04:38.090> system

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:38.580

be<00:04:53.310> hard<00:04:53.340> for<00:04:53.789> you<00:04:54.060> to<00:04:54.090> beat<00:04:54.419> the<00:04:55.020> economics<00:04:55.590> of

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:55.710 
be hard for you to beat the economics of

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:57.730 
be hard for you to beat the economics of
a<00:04:55.800> store-bought<00:04:56.069> system<00:04:56.699> but<00:04:57.389> you<00:04:57.539> know

00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:57.740 
a store-bought system but you know

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:59.959 
a store-bought system but you know
compared<00:04:58.740> to<00:04:58.770> building<00:04:58.979> your<00:04:59.310> own<00:04:59.430> I<00:04:59.610> mean<00:04:59.789> you

00:04:59.959 --> 00:04:59.969 
compared to building your own I mean you

00:04:59.969 --> 00:05:01.490 
compared to building your own I mean you
can<00:05:00.210> build<00:05:00.479> your<00:05:00.659> own<00:05:00.689> system<00:05:00.930> from<00:05:01.199> scratch

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:01.500 
can build your own system from scratch

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:03.619 
can build your own system from scratch
and<00:05:01.740> I<00:05:01.800> do<00:05:01.860> it<00:05:02.099> all<00:05:02.219> the<00:05:02.340> time<00:05:02.370> myself<00:05:02.729> the

00:05:03.619 --> 00:05:03.629 
and I do it all the time myself the

00:05:03.629 --> 00:05:05.330 
and I do it all the time myself the
problem<00:05:04.020> is<00:05:04.139> I<00:05:04.259> always<00:05:04.289> end<00:05:04.680> up<00:05:04.740> spending<00:05:05.159> more

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:05.340 
problem is I always end up spending more

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:07.339 
problem is I always end up spending more
money<00:05:05.400> than<00:05:05.729> if<00:05:06.270> I<00:05:06.419> were<00:05:06.539> to<00:05:06.659> simply<00:05:06.930> called<00:05:07.169> up

00:05:07.339 --> 00:05:07.349 
money than if I were to simply called up

00:05:07.349 --> 00:05:09.709 
money than if I were to simply called up
you<00:05:07.590> know<00:05:07.680> 1-800<00:05:08.370> you<00:05:08.639> know<00:05:08.729> Dell<00:05:08.969> or<00:05:09.270> gateway

00:05:09.709 --> 00:05:09.719 
you know 1-800 you know Dell or gateway

00:05:09.719 --> 00:05:12.050 
you know 1-800 you know Dell or gateway
or<00:05:09.900> my<00:05:10.080> crime<00:05:10.349> PC<00:05:10.830> and<00:05:11.069> bought<00:05:11.520> a<00:05:11.550> system<00:05:11.940> from

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:12.060 
or my crime PC and bought a system from

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:14.990 
or my crime PC and bought a system from
them<00:05:12.289> so<00:05:13.289> keep<00:05:13.500> that<00:05:13.680> in<00:05:13.740> mind<00:05:13.860> the<00:05:14.520> cool<00:05:14.759> thing

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:15.000 
them so keep that in mind the cool thing

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.399 
them so keep that in mind the cool thing
about<00:05:15.030> building<00:05:15.419> your<00:05:15.599> own<00:05:15.810> system<00:05:16.199> is<00:05:16.319> you

00:05:16.399 --> 00:05:16.409 
about building your own system is you

00:05:16.409 --> 00:05:17.990 
about building your own system is you
get<00:05:16.530> to<00:05:16.620> pick<00:05:16.770> all<00:05:16.919> of<00:05:17.099> the<00:05:17.190> individual<00:05:17.669> parts

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:18.000 
get to pick all of the individual parts

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.330 
get to pick all of the individual parts
and<00:05:18.199> by<00:05:19.199> selecting<00:05:19.500> all<00:05:19.919> the<00:05:19.949> parts

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:20.340 
and by selecting all the parts

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:21.950 
and by selecting all the parts
individually<00:05:21.000> you<00:05:21.360> can<00:05:21.449> also<00:05:21.599> make<00:05:21.840> sure

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:21.960 
individually you can also make sure

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:23.869 
individually you can also make sure
using<00:05:22.199> industry<00:05:22.740> standard<00:05:22.830> components<00:05:23.759> and

00:05:23.869 --> 00:05:23.879 
using industry standard components and

00:05:23.879 --> 00:05:25.459 
using industry standard components and
that<00:05:23.969> means<00:05:24.180> that<00:05:24.330> you'll<00:05:24.509> have<00:05:24.599> the<00:05:24.659> system

00:05:25.459 --> 00:05:25.469 
that means that you'll have the system

00:05:25.469 --> 00:05:27.170 
that means that you'll have the system
that<00:05:25.620> is<00:05:25.740> the<00:05:25.889> most<00:05:26.159> upgradable<00:05:26.969> and

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:27.180 
that is the most upgradable and

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:28.670 
that is the most upgradable and
repairable<00:05:27.629> in<00:05:27.840> the<00:05:27.960> future<00:05:28.289> that<00:05:28.500> is<00:05:28.650> a

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:28.680 
repairable in the future that is a

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:31.040 
repairable in the future that is a
system<00:05:29.069> that<00:05:29.190> you<00:05:29.340> can<00:05:29.490> really<00:05:29.699> support<00:05:30.050> now

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:31.050 
system that you can really support now

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:32.510 
system that you can really support now
another<00:05:31.560> thing<00:05:31.680> to<00:05:31.889> consider<00:05:32.190> though<00:05:32.370> is<00:05:32.400> that

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:32.520 
another thing to consider though is that

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:34.339 
another thing to consider though is that
many<00:05:32.789> of<00:05:32.849> these<00:05:33.029> name-brand<00:05:33.599> system

00:05:34.339 --> 00:05:34.349 
many of these name-brand system

00:05:34.349 --> 00:05:36.110 
many of these name-brand system
manufacturers<00:05:35.009> like<00:05:35.580> some<00:05:35.759> of<00:05:35.849> those<00:05:35.969> I

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:36.120 
manufacturers like some of those I

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:38.629 
manufacturers like some of those I
mentioned<00:05:36.330> also<00:05:37.169> sell<00:05:37.439> industry<00:05:38.219> standard

00:05:38.629 --> 00:05:38.639 
mentioned also sell industry standard

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:40.279 
mentioned also sell industry standard
systems<00:05:39.060> which<00:05:39.240> means<00:05:39.479> that<00:05:39.719> even<00:05:39.990> if<00:05:40.199> you

00:05:40.279 --> 00:05:40.289 
systems which means that even if you

00:05:40.289 --> 00:05:42.260 
systems which means that even if you
purchase<00:05:40.680> a<00:05:40.770> store-bought<00:05:41.039> system<00:05:41.669> you<00:05:42.090> can

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:42.270 
purchase a store-bought system you can

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:43.820 
purchase a store-bought system you can
have<00:05:42.300> something<00:05:42.779> that<00:05:42.870> can<00:05:42.960> be<00:05:43.110> upgraded<00:05:43.289> or

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:43.830 
have something that can be upgraded or

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:45.890 
have something that can be upgraded or
repaired<00:05:44.250> later<00:05:44.550> on<00:05:44.819> that<00:05:45.210> is<00:05:45.360> you<00:05:45.750> can

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:45.900 
repaired later on that is you can

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:47.480 
repaired later on that is you can
purchase<00:05:46.080> replacement<00:05:46.469> motherboards<00:05:47.340> which

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:47.490 
purchase replacement motherboards which

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:49.040 
purchase replacement motherboards which
will<00:05:47.639> fit<00:05:47.849> directly<00:05:48.330> in<00:05:48.449> place<00:05:48.629> of<00:05:48.840> the<00:05:48.930> one

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:49.050 
will fit directly in place of the one

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:51.379 
will fit directly in place of the one
that's<00:05:49.229> in<00:05:49.379> there<00:05:49.560> you<00:05:50.099> know<00:05:50.219> with<00:05:51.210> a<00:05:51.240> new

00:05:51.379 --> 00:05:51.389 
that's in there you know with a new

00:05:51.389 --> 00:05:53.089 
that's in there you know with a new
processor<00:05:51.930> in<00:05:52.050> RAM<00:05:52.229> you<00:05:52.740> know<00:05:52.830> you<00:05:52.949> can

00:05:53.089 --> 00:05:53.099 
processor in RAM you know you can

00:05:53.099 --> 00:05:54.769 
processor in RAM you know you can
upgrade<00:05:53.370> the<00:05:53.669> hard<00:05:53.879> drive<00:05:54.120> at<00:05:54.300> a<00:05:54.330> later<00:05:54.509> point

00:05:54.769 --> 00:05:54.779 
upgrade the hard drive at a later point

00:05:54.779 --> 00:05:57.469 
upgrade the hard drive at a later point
in<00:05:54.930> time<00:05:54.990> the<00:05:55.409> video<00:05:55.560> card<00:05:56.120> etc<00:05:57.120> so<00:05:57.449> just

00:05:57.469 --> 00:05:57.479 
in time the video card etc so just

00:05:57.479 --> 00:05:58.999 
in time the video card etc so just
because<00:05:57.960> you<00:05:58.169> purchase<00:05:58.529> a<00:05:58.650> store-bought

00:05:58.999 --> 00:05:59.009 
because you purchase a store-bought

00:05:59.009 --> 00:06:00.649 
because you purchase a store-bought
system<00:05:59.430> doesn't<00:05:59.580> mean<00:05:59.699> that<00:06:00.300> you<00:06:00.479> can't

00:06:00.649 --> 00:06:00.659 
system doesn't mean that you can't

00:06:00.659 --> 00:06:01.519 
system doesn't mean that you can't
upgrade<00:06:00.839> it<00:06:01.139> later

00:06:01.519 --> 00:06:01.529 
upgrade it later

00:06:01.529 --> 00:06:03.379 
upgrade it later
of<00:06:02.400> course<00:06:02.669> that's<00:06:02.849> as<00:06:03.029> long<00:06:03.150> as<00:06:03.330> you

00:06:03.379 --> 00:06:03.389 
of course that's as long as you

00:06:03.389 --> 00:06:05.540 
of course that's as long as you
purchased<00:06:03.779> what<00:06:04.589> we<00:06:04.710> consider<00:06:05.039> an<00:06:05.190> industry

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:05.550 
purchased what we consider an industry

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:07.010 
purchased what we consider an industry
standard<00:06:05.969> system<00:06:06.300> if<00:06:06.449> you<00:06:06.539> purchased<00:06:06.930> a

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:07.020 
standard system if you purchased a

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:09.200 
standard system if you purchased a
system<00:06:07.409> that<00:06:07.560> uses<00:06:07.740> proprietary<00:06:08.210> components

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:09.210 
system that uses proprietary components

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:10.939 
system that uses proprietary components
then<00:06:09.659> you'll<00:06:09.839> find<00:06:10.110> that<00:06:10.259> you<00:06:10.379> will<00:06:10.469> not<00:06:10.710> be

00:06:10.939 --> 00:06:10.949 
then you'll find that you will not be

00:06:10.949 --> 00:06:13.519 
then you'll find that you will not be
able<00:06:11.039> to<00:06:11.190> upgrade<00:06:11.550> the<00:06:11.669> motherboard<00:06:12.379> you<00:06:13.379> will

00:06:13.519 --> 00:06:13.529 
able to upgrade the motherboard you will

00:06:13.529 --> 00:06:15.290 
able to upgrade the motherboard you will
not<00:06:13.680> be<00:06:13.860> able<00:06:13.979> to<00:06:14.099> use<00:06:14.370> you<00:06:14.639> know<00:06:14.729> the<00:06:14.879> existing

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:15.300 
not be able to use you know the existing

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:17.540 
not be able to use you know the existing
power<00:06:15.479> supply<00:06:15.930> and<00:06:16.199> chassis<00:06:16.919> and<00:06:17.219> things<00:06:17.430> like

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:17.550 
power supply and chassis and things like

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:19.129 
power supply and chassis and things like
that<00:06:17.789> so<00:06:17.969> in<00:06:18.060> that<00:06:18.150> case<00:06:18.419> an<00:06:18.569> upgrade<00:06:18.930> will

00:06:19.129 --> 00:06:19.139 
that so in that case an upgrade will

00:06:19.139 --> 00:06:21.439 
that so in that case an upgrade will
almost<00:06:19.409> in<00:06:19.740> you<00:06:20.520> know<00:06:20.610> always<00:06:21.089> entail

00:06:21.439 --> 00:06:21.449 
almost in you know always entail

00:06:21.449 --> 00:06:23.269 
almost in you know always entail
building<00:06:21.990> a<00:06:22.080> new<00:06:22.199> system<00:06:22.560> from<00:06:22.680> scratch<00:06:22.919> that

00:06:23.269 --> 00:06:23.279 
building a new system from scratch that

00:06:23.279 --> 00:06:24.860 
building a new system from scratch that
is<00:06:23.400> you'll<00:06:23.580> be<00:06:23.759> replacing<00:06:24.180> the<00:06:24.270> chassis<00:06:24.690> the

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:24.870 
is you'll be replacing the chassis the

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:26.510 
is you'll be replacing the chassis the
power<00:06:25.050> supply<00:06:25.469> the<00:06:25.500> motherboard<00:06:26.219> and

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:26.520 
power supply the motherboard and

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:28.100 
power supply the motherboard and
virtually<00:06:27.210> all<00:06:27.330> the<00:06:27.479> components<00:06:27.960> in<00:06:27.990> the

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:28.110 
virtually all the components in the

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:30.200 
virtually all the components in the
system<00:06:28.289> I<00:06:28.620> mean<00:06:29.159> just<00:06:29.339> saving<00:06:29.520> the<00:06:29.759> hard<00:06:29.940> drive

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:30.210 
system I mean just saving the hard drive

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:32.149 
system I mean just saving the hard drive
and<00:06:30.389> the<00:06:30.479> keyboard<00:06:30.870> and<00:06:30.990> the<00:06:31.050> mouse<00:06:31.080> to<00:06:31.860> me<00:06:31.979> is

00:06:32.149 --> 00:06:32.159 
and the keyboard and the mouse to me is

00:06:32.159 --> 00:06:34.610 
and the keyboard and the mouse to me is
not<00:06:32.940> really<00:06:33.000> much<00:06:33.599> of<00:06:33.629> an<00:06:33.839> upgrade<00:06:33.960> so<00:06:34.199> much<00:06:34.500> is

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:34.620 
not really much of an upgrade so much is

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:36.980 
not really much of an upgrade so much is
building<00:06:34.949> a<00:06:35.009> whole<00:06:35.159> new<00:06:35.279> system<00:06:35.460> so<00:06:35.930> these<00:06:36.930> are

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:36.990 
building a whole new system so these are

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:38.149 
building a whole new system so these are
some<00:06:37.199> of<00:06:37.229> the<00:06:37.319> important<00:06:37.740> things<00:06:37.919> that<00:06:37.979> you'll

00:06:38.149 --> 00:06:38.159 
some of the important things that you'll

00:06:38.159 --> 00:06:40.519 
some of the important things that you'll
have<00:06:38.250> to<00:06:38.339> consider<00:06:38.729> now<00:06:39.659> if<00:06:39.839> you<00:06:39.960> do<00:06:40.080> decide<00:06:40.110> to

00:06:40.519 --> 00:06:40.529 
have to consider now if you do decide to

00:06:40.529 --> 00:06:42.170 
have to consider now if you do decide to
build<00:06:40.650> a<00:06:40.919> system<00:06:41.159> from<00:06:41.460> scratch<00:06:41.729> you<00:06:41.940> want<00:06:42.120> to

00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:42.180 
build a system from scratch you want to

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:43.790 
build a system from scratch you want to
find<00:06:42.389> you<00:06:42.599> know<00:06:42.690> an<00:06:42.779> industry<00:06:43.110> standard<00:06:43.469> ATX

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:43.800
