00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:31.810 
the highest number of total points under
22<00:02:26.360> is<00:02:26.780> the<00:02:26.840> winner<00:02:29.830> so<00:02:30.830> a<00:02:30.860> picture<00:02:31.280> card<00:02:31.520> is

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:31.820 
22 is the winner so a picture card is

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:36.160 
22 is the winner so a picture card is
worth<00:02:32.630> in<00:02:33.020> 10<00:02:33.290> so<00:02:34.010> a<00:02:34.040> jack<00:02:34.400> queen<00:02:34.910> or<00:02:35.240> king<00:02:35.540> is

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
worth in 10 so a jack queen or king is

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:38.470 
worth in 10 so a jack queen or king is
worth<00:02:36.500> 10<00:02:36.800> points<00:02:36.830> have<00:02:37.700> their<00:02:37.970> old<00:02:38.120> picture

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
worth 10 points have their old picture

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.170 
worth 10 points have their old picture
cards<00:02:38.950> so<00:02:39.950> this<00:02:40.130> is<00:02:40.280> worth<00:02:40.459> it<00:02:40.700> that's<00:02:40.910> worth

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
cards so this is worth it that's worth
