00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.520
 Professor of the quality of life of cancer patients in recent years 

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:11.779
 assumed greater importance 

00:00:11.779 --> 00:00:17.809
 undoubtedly the quality of life of cars in recent years is a great development 

00:00:17.809 --> 00:00:20.620
 there is a significant interest from the community 

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:25.890
 oncology on this aspect because fortunately for many of the diseases 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.700
 the cure rate has increased and so we also owe it today 

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:32.560
 worry 

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:37.100
 how the disease pathway is dealt with during treatment but also 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.120
 of outcomes after treatment 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.080
 and here we must choose therapeutic strategies to respect the thirst of 

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:45.510
 subsequent quality of life of the patients 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:51.710
 there is a great interest I would say that also the assistance modalities la 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:53.810
 cancer patient have changed 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:56.139
 more and more in large centers 

00:00:56.139 --> 00:01:00.759
 and in particular in the centers and are involved in this event to be held 

00:01:00.759 --> 00:01:06.369
 on 8 March that is another new speech to take care of 

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:10.030
 patient with a stamp that is no longer possible or only by the oncologist 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:15.200
 or by the surgeon but which also includes the man belts and as the psychologist the 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:20.670
 rehabilitator and also kit helps the patient to face problems of 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.620
 I imagine these aspects to be queen, I would say that today they have become 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:26.320
 fundamental 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:30.030
 hotels at the therapeutic bridge there have also been in this field of 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.160
 progress present in chemotherapy 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:37.230
 certainly today we have a lot more drugs than in the past 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:42.730
 and many of these drugs are developed have been developed precisely 

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:46.880
 with the intent to reduce the toxic effects of chemotherapy to batteries 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.969
 many chemotherapy and today are not as devastating as in the past 

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:51.760
 I can do 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:55.010
 an example of is that of the medicinal doctor 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:02:00.570
 the huns an old drug that was burdened with cardiac toxicity than it did 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:05.340
 fall hair today we have a reissue of this available 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.970
 drug that does the same thing with a bang inside a rest but for you 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:14.150
 example does not drop hair &amp; gt usciere means - meanings 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.910
 increased both the other aspect treatment and I would like to emphasize that 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:22.200
 of the development of supportive therapies, that is all those drugs of which today 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.570
 we have available that air can be used to mitigate the side effects of chemotherapy 

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:31.520
 also in this field, let us consider, for example, whether the problem of crops 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.110
 ndocaj chemotherapy 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:36.560
 ooh wings and therapies to fight anemia 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.820
 really significant inhalant steps have been taken 

00:03:41.289 --> 00:03:45.359
 professor with which resources it is possible to preserve the image that the 

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:47.959
 woman hit by a tumor adi herself 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:52.860
 but in the meantime I would say that by making the best use of the therapeutic weapons we have 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:57.910
 in particular I would say that in the case of gynecological tumors surgery is the 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:01.660
 today we can do chemotherapy as far as surgery is concerned 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:04.189
 of interventions. radicals 

00:04:04.189 --> 00:04:09.749
 therefore very effective healing without many times opening the patient's belly 

00:04:09.749 --> 00:04:13.849
 this is how much you can impact on a woman's quality of life 

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:14.479
 then 

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:18.349
 I believe it starts going more and more towards common interventions in liabilities 

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:23.669
 minor with the same care possibilities as regards and therapies 

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:28.520
 we doctors today would say two or three very important strands 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:32.999
 review of traditional drugs, however, doxorubicin paintings informed of 

00:04:32.999 --> 00:04:38.599
 different pharmacological that allow to have the best injured I appreciate 

00:04:38.599 --> 00:04:40.860
 side effects 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:45.430
 more limited then we have the so-called biological drugs that seem very much 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:49.560
 active in selectively targeting cancer cells while sparing cells 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:54.099
 healthy we even believe this to be important 

00:04:54.099 --> 00:04:58.839
 the need and the possibility to combine at least these drugs with lights 

00:04:58.839 --> 00:05:00.979
 red patients survive long 

00:05:00.979 --> 00:05:05.240
 we must also have the possibility to use drugs in a modular way 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:09.560
 install over time and with this we invite you a lot of collateral defects 

00:05:09.559 --> 00:05:12.559
 we get adequate therapeutic effects 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:16.900
 here the Gemelli University Hospital in Rome was among the first in 

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:20.500
 Italy to make the quality of life of ecological patients a cornerstone 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:22.150
 assistance 

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:25.770
 what are the supports that a hospital should provide to women 

00:05:27.569 --> 00:05:29.569
 obviously it is obvious 

00:05:29.569 --> 00:05:34.409
 the excellence of the pure cioni hospital 18 and constraint day fritte compute issa 

00:05:34.409 --> 00:05:38.919
 of the treatments you had taken the types of excellence needed then all that 

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:43.669
 that support around the classic care in the meantime of psycho-oncology services 

00:05:43.669 --> 00:05:48.249
 keith guarantee a psychological support for patients who have one 

00:05:48.249 --> 00:05:52.650
 cancer diagnosis and these chemotherapies undergo absolutely 

00:05:52.649 --> 00:05:57.330
 fundamental then social services because we know well that 

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:02.169
 today when a woman suffering from cancer feels the whole family then with 

00:06:02.169 --> 00:06:05.619
 a center that you want to buy full oncology should favor 

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:12.580
 Madonna access to the hospital to keep the patrol as little as possible and supplies like 

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:16.830
 we are also trying to do outside the media for example for 

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:20.900
 family management we have volunteer services that they take in 

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:26.350
 charged in many cases for the bridge the children of women with cancer in the moment 

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:28.619
 more critical of their illness 

00:06:28.619 --> 00:06:33.469
 I believe this is fundamental the other aspect and certainly teach 

00:06:33.469 --> 00:06:37.949
 to these women who take care of their own image is also very important therefore 

00:06:37.949 --> 00:06:43.289
 we provide many services both within the aesthetics of the image 

00:06:43.289 --> 00:06:47.990
 if the support then helps me to pass the dog time with tranquility 

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:52.259
 in the hospital there is a whole volunteer social assistance service there 

00:06:52.259 --> 00:06:54.619
 guarantees a stay in the city hospital
