00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:43.940 
mind sculptor he's excellent he's
actually<00:02:42.270> not<00:02:42.690> the<00:02:42.870> best<00:02:43.080> planeswalker<00:02:43.650> in

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950

this<00:02:44.160> deck<00:02:44.430> which<00:02:44.700> is<00:02:44.730> weird<00:02:45.180> to<00:02:45.420> say<00:02:45.660> because

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:45.990 
this deck which is weird to say because

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:48.820 
this deck which is weird to say because
he's<00:02:46.260> jace<00:02:46.470> the<00:02:46.500> mind<00:02:46.650> sculptor<00:02:46.980> but<00:02:47.490> he

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:48.830 
he's jace the mind sculptor but he

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:52.730 
he's jace the mind sculptor but he
definitely<00:02:49.880> acquits<00:02:50.880> himself<00:02:51.060> admirably<00:02:51.740> and

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:52.740 
definitely acquits himself admirably and

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:54.530 
definitely acquits himself admirably and
then<00:02:53.370> we<00:02:53.490> play<00:02:53.640> the<00:02:53.760> four<00:02:53.970> force<00:02:54.240> of<00:02:54.420> will

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
then we play the four force of will

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.440 
then we play the four force of will
because<00:02:55.340> sometimes<00:02:56.340> people<00:02:56.760> are<00:02:57.270> going<00:02:57.390> to

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
because sometimes people are going to

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:58.580 
because sometimes people are going to
play<00:02:57.600> something<00:02:57.960> that<00:02:58.080> you<00:02:58.140> really<00:02:58.290> can't

enough and the reason that it plays

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:34.670 
enough and the reason that it plays
seven<00:03:32.190> of<00:03:32.370> these<00:03:32.460> is<00:03:32.990> you<00:03:33.990> want<00:03:34.200> to<00:03:34.290> keep<00:03:34.410> hands

seven of these is you want to keep hands

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.840 
seven of these is you want to keep hands
where<00:03:34.950> you<00:03:34.980> can<00:03:35.070> either<00:03:35.490> go<00:03:35.730> turn<00:03:36.120> one<00:03:37.850> signet

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:38.850 
where you can either go turn one signet

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:42.190 
where you can either go turn one signet
or<00:03:39.000> talisman<00:03:39.840> or<00:03:40.050> turn<00:03:40.590> one<00:03:40.800> chalice<00:03:41.250> at<00:03:41.400> one

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:42.200 
or talisman or turn one chalice at one

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:45.080 
or talisman or turn one chalice at one
because<00:03:43.280> chalice<00:03:44.280> at<00:03:44.400> one<00:03:44.580> is<00:03:44.760> going<00:03:44.970> to

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
because chalice at one is going to

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:48.290 
because chalice at one is going to
pretty<00:03:46.080> much<00:03:46.230> nullify<00:03:46.800> a<00:03:47.100> lot<00:03:47.430> of<00:03:47.550> what<00:03:47.730> your

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:48.300 
pretty much nullify a lot of what your

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:51.200 
pretty much nullify a lot of what your
opponent<00:03:48.570> is<00:03:48.870> likely<00:03:49.230> to<00:03:49.260> try<00:03:49.530> and<00:03:49.680> do<00:03:49.860> and<00:03:50.210> if

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:51.210 
opponent is likely to try and do and if

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:53.570 
opponent is likely to try and do and if
you<00:03:51.390> get<00:03:51.510> a<00:03:51.570> turn<00:03:51.900> one<00:03:52.140> signal<00:03:52.800> or<00:03:52.950> talisman

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:53.580 
you get a turn one signal or talisman

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:55.490 
you get a turn one signal or talisman
that<00:03:53.790> sets<00:03:54.570> you<00:03:54.660> up<00:03:54.690> to<00:03:54.900> get<00:03:55.020> a<00:03:55.050> turn<00:03:55.260> to

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
that sets you up to get a turn to

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.720 
that sets you up to get a turn to
planeswalker<00:03:56.160> which<00:03:56.490> is<00:03:56.670> just<00:03:56.910> very<00:03:57.240> unfair

00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:58.730 
planeswalker which is just very unfair

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:00.650 
planeswalker which is just very unfair
