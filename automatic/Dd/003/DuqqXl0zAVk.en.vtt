00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:28.230

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:42.840
 of hours the police will be banned from doing 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:44.730
 an examination of the BAC agents go 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.620
 to see that everything is going with the 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.629
 tranquility of the case more or less

 an approximate of 75 thousand vehicles 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:13.630
 we are at a rush hour this hour 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:16.400
 most took the opportunity to recommend the 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:19.630
 lunches and they would come out as lying and 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:23.649
 anticipation there was not so much congestion 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:25.329
 do not forget that you should not take apart 

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:28.630
 of that there are breathalyzer operatives and 

00:01:25.329 --> 00:01:32.740
 there are mari speed operatives in 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:35.140
 different points where you are going to take the 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:38.500
 control that is required so that 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:40.720
 exceed ask some study pains 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.630
 this plan has been made that works 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:45.039
 during the beach season where 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.380
 enable the posters in this case the 

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:51.130
 return lanes to facilitate the 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:53.830
 access if you just enter we have a 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:55.450
 infographic to be able to give the subject of the 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:58.010
 schedules that is important to know 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.930
 because what the genre said 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:02.090
 the important thing is to know that there are hours 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:05.420
 tip both return and return 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.920
 then also the Pan-American goes to 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:09.560
 have specific hours 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.210
 yes of course yes in fact in this 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.580
 moment we are at rush hour until 

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:16.820
 2 o'clock in the afternoon and beginning of 3 o'clock in 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:19.520
 the afternoon where we started to work 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:22.130
 in the influx of traffic in addition to that 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:24.170
 I ask you please from your homes that 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:27.500
 write down the number in case of emergencies 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:29.150
 which is 2 17 42 92 other than the 90 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.860
 where the municipality 'lima the hotels 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:32.960
 if they have a problem with schedules 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.850
 as per schedule and we're in the second 

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:37.280
 part that is the strongest part in 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:38.810
 traffic from 10 to 2 in the afternoon 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.920
 two o'clock in the afternoon and after 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:42.320
 three in the afternoon and starts to go down 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.360
 now we can see that the traffic 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:47.590
 is quite loaded on return is 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:50.440
 important to refer the sea and what 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:53.890
 of Sunday's drop from 4 to 8 of the 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:56.680
 night will be both south routes towards 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:58.209
 north so that people from that 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.190
 have been in the south can reach 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:02.890
 their houses faster and in better shape is 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:05.830
 say the best time to leave today 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:07.299
 Thursday Thursday would be from 34 to 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:08.890
 from 3 in the afternoon after 

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:10.420
 have a little nap 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:12.250
 I think it's a good time to go to the 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:14.290
 beach to be with the family already in 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:17.170
 the beaches of the south sea ​​and the sun for 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:19.750
 return the best time and quietest 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:21.880
 definitely beginnings but of 48 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:24.849
 we have the Pan American way 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:26.920
 totally open to Libya is not worth 

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:29.829
 we hear you sea ​​and traffic for 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:33.549
 get to that point nothing else until the 

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:36.220
 villa toll is strong how much was 

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:39.400
 maradona yes that is from jesus-maría 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:41.510
 until almost lying no less than 50 minutes 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:45.000
 because the part of sole 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:46.290
 I think there is a geographical one but that is 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.420
 it is understandable just but that 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:51.090
 they commented both for the amount of 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:54.150
 people who choose to leave at this time 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:56.370
 general truth so as I go 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:59.390
 arriving at noon will increase the 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:59.390
 traffic as indicated 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:04.380
 michael until 3 pm 

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:08.600
 currently the road is free until 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:11.280
 arica bridge where where the vehicles 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:14.400
 they lead to two lanes and that with a little 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:16.049
 more than failure then I left early and 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.410
 do not wait for the time points we pray to 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:18.410
 your
