00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:04.020 
percent now what is it worth 105 how

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:07.790 
percent now what is it worth 105 how
comes<00:05:04.260> the<00:05:04.470> same<00:05:04.650> answer<00:05:06.230> because<00:05:07.230> equity

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:07.800 
comes the same answer because equity

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:09.410 
comes the same answer because equity
doesn't<00:05:08.130> have<00:05:08.280> a<00:05:08.310> rate<00:05:08.580> of<00:05:08.730> return<00:05:09.090> we<00:05:09.300> have

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:09.420

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:11.210 
doesn't have a rate of return we have
this<00:05:09.570> misconception<00:05:09.900> that<00:05:10.740> because<00:05:11.100> the

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:11.220 
this misconception that because the

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:13.670 
this misconception that because the
house<00:05:11.370> is<00:05:11.610> appreciating<00:05:12.420> that<00:05:12.600> equity<00:05:13.530> has<00:05:13.620> a

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:38.070 
the end of the year 110 oh I made 10,000

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:41.740 
the end of the year 110 oh I made 10,000
here<00:05:38.340> and<00:05:39.320> 5,000<00:05:40.320> here<00:05:40.500> for<00:05:40.710> a<00:05:40.740> total<00:05:41.160> of

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:41.750

fifteen<00:05:42.750> oh<00:05:43.110> that<00:05:43.680> sounds<00:05:43.980> like<00:05:44.130> three<00:05:44.430> times

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:44.730 
fifteen oh that sounds like three times

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:52.910 
fifteen oh that sounds like three times
as<00:05:44.940> much<00:05:45.090> as<00:05:45.330> 5,000<00:05:46.430> triple<00:05:48.170> but<00:05:49.820> but<00:05:51.920> there's

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:52.920 
as much as 5,000 triple but but there's

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:55.280 
as much as 5,000 triple but but there's
a<00:05:53.010> mortgage<00:05:53.580> there<00:05:53.910> right<00:05:54.240> let's<00:05:55.020> see<00:05:55.170> if<00:05:55.260> that

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:55.290 
a mortgage there right let's see if that

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:57.680 
a mortgage there right let's see if that
makes<00:05:55.590> sense<00:05:55.830> if<00:05:56.040> i<00:05:56.160> made<00:05:56.580> fifteen<00:05:56.850> thousand

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:57.690 
makes sense if i made fifteen thousand

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:00.560 
makes sense if i made fifteen thousand
but<00:05:57.840> i<00:05:57.870> had<00:05:58.350> to<00:05:58.380> pay<00:05:58.680> employment<00:05:59.310> cost<00:05:59.570> let's

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:00.570 
but i had to pay employment cost let's

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:02.200 
but i had to pay employment cost let's
say<00:06:00.720> i<00:06:00.750> borrowed<00:06:01.110> the<00:06:01.200> money<00:06:01.230> at<00:06:01.470> six<00:06:01.710> percent

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:02.210 
say i borrowed the money at six percent

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:05.090 
say i borrowed the money at six percent
so<00:06:03.210> that's<00:06:03.390> six<00:06:03.630> thousand<00:06:04.080> dollars<00:06:04.110> that<00:06:05.010> i

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:05.100 
so that's six thousand dollars that i

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:08.720 
so that's six thousand dollars that i
paid<00:06:05.460> in<00:06:05.730> order<00:06:05.970> to<00:06:06.060> separate<00:06:06.480> it<00:06:06.660> so<00:06:07.320> a<00:06:07.730> 15,000

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:08.730 
paid in order to separate it so a 15,000

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:12.670 
paid in order to separate it so a 15,000
minus<00:06:09.150> six<00:06:09.630> thousand<00:06:10.170> is<00:06:10.260> a<00:06:10.290> net<00:06:10.560> of<00:06:11.570> 9,000
