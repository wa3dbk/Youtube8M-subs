in maze manners scooby-doo is in a

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:15.069 
in maze manners scooby-doo is in a
manner<00:01:13.189> that's<00:01:13.579> amazed<00:01:14.090> the<00:01:14.659> idea<00:01:14.959> is<00:01:15.049> to

00:01:15.069 --> 00:01:15.079 
manner that's amazed the idea is to

00:01:15.079 --> 00:01:17.199 
manner that's amazed the idea is to
dodge<00:01:15.469> enemies<00:01:15.889> and<00:01:16.130> walk<00:01:16.369> into<00:01:16.700> numbers<00:01:17.029> in

their numerical order

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:20.050 
their numerical order
doing<00:01:18.679> so<00:01:18.859> will<00:01:19.009> shut<00:01:19.249> down<00:01:19.279> the<00:01:19.579> projector

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:20.060 
doing so will shut down the projector

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:21.550 
doing so will shut down the projector
and<00:01:20.270> you<00:01:20.389> can<00:01:20.509> move<00:01:20.630> on<00:01:20.810> to<00:01:20.929> the<00:01:20.990> next<00:01:21.229> level

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:21.560 
and you can move on to the next level

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:22.989 
and you can move on to the next level
it's<00:01:21.829> got<00:01:22.009> a<00:01:22.039> bunch<00:01:22.279> of<00:01:22.429> levels<00:01:22.729> and<00:01:22.880> the

00:01:22.989 --> 00:01:22.999 
it's got a bunch of levels and the

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:24.789 
it's got a bunch of levels and the
scenery<00:01:23.359> is<00:01:23.509> changed<00:01:23.990> in<00:01:24.139> every<00:01:24.409> level<00:01:24.590> which

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:24.799 
scenery is changed in every level which

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:26.379 
scenery is changed in every level which
is<00:01:24.950> really<00:01:25.219> nice<00:01:25.369> some<00:01:25.789> of<00:01:25.880> the<00:01:25.939> levels<00:01:26.209> have<00:01:26.359> a

00:01:26.379 --> 00:01:26.389 
is really nice some of the levels have a

00:01:26.389 --> 00:01:28.719 
is really nice some of the levels have a
invincibility<00:01:27.350> powerup<00:01:28.069> I<00:01:28.219> think<00:01:28.609> is<00:01:28.700> a

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:28.729 
invincibility powerup I think is a

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:30.730 
invincibility powerup I think is a
Scooby<00:01:29.179> Snack<00:01:29.240> and<00:01:29.749> it<00:01:29.869> really<00:01:30.349> probably

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:30.740 
Scooby Snack and it really probably

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:32.649 
Scooby Snack and it really probably
wasn't<00:01:30.889> necessary<00:01:31.459> to<00:01:31.579> put<00:01:31.759> that<00:01:31.969> in<00:01:32.149> but<00:01:32.389> the

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:32.659 
wasn't necessary to put that in but the

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:34.269 
wasn't necessary to put that in but the
game<00:01:32.840> still<00:01:33.049> was<00:01:33.259> pretty<00:01:33.319> fun<00:01:33.740> it<00:01:33.920> probably

00:01:34.269 --> 00:01:34.279 
game still was pretty fun it probably

00:01:34.279 --> 00:01:35.889 
game still was pretty fun it probably
could<00:01:34.399> have<00:01:34.429> used<00:01:34.520> a<00:01:34.819> few<00:01:35.119> more<00:01:35.329> levels<00:01:35.569> though

00:01:35.889 --> 00:01:35.899 
could have used a few more levels though

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:37.929 
could have used a few more levels though
