button<00:00:04.560> autofocus<00:00:04.740> on<00:00:05.430> your<00:00:05.790> Lumix<00:00:06.720> G<00:00:06.990> H<00:00:07.109> 3<00:00:07.500> or

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
button autofocus on your Lumix G H 3 or

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.700 
button autofocus on your Lumix G H 3 or
your<00:00:08.130> Lumix<00:00:08.639> G<00:00:08.820> x7<00:00:09.330> camera<00:00:09.750> the<00:00:10.139> process<00:00:10.530> is

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
your Lumix G x7 camera the process is

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.160 
your Lumix G x7 camera the process is
the<00:00:10.860> same<00:00:10.889> for<00:00:11.309> both<00:00:11.340> cameras<00:00:11.940> so<00:00:12.509> it'll<00:00:13.080> be

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
the same for both cameras so it'll be

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.259 
the same for both cameras so it'll be
pretty<00:00:13.349> simple<00:00:13.710> and<00:00:14.160> what<00:00:14.790> back<00:00:14.969> button

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
pretty simple and what back button

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.090 
pretty simple and what back button
autofocus<00:00:15.360> does<00:00:16.020> is<00:00:16.289> basically<00:00:16.710> take<00:00:16.949> the

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
autofocus does is basically take the

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.970 
autofocus does is basically take the
autofocus<00:00:17.640> away<00:00:18.359> from<00:00:18.810> your<00:00:19.109> shutter<00:00:19.410> release

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
autofocus away from your shutter release

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.800 
autofocus away from your shutter release
so<00:00:20.369> the<00:00:20.490> shutter<00:00:20.699> release<00:00:20.789> button<00:00:21.029> simply

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
so the shutter release button simply

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.750 
so the shutter release button simply
releases<00:00:22.560> the<00:00:22.680> shutter<00:00:22.890> it<00:00:23.070> doesn't<00:00:23.400> activate

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
releases the shutter it doesn't activate

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.939 
releases the shutter it doesn't activate
the<00:00:23.880> autofocus<00:00:24.510> and<00:00:24.660> then<00:00:25.140> to<00:00:25.320> activate<00:00:25.830> the

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
the autofocus and then to activate the

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.980 
the autofocus and then to activate the
autofocus<00:00:26.369> we're<00:00:26.760> going<00:00:26.880> to<00:00:26.939> use<00:00:27.119> the<00:00:27.330> AF<00:00:27.720> AE

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
autofocus we're going to use the AF AE

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.560 
autofocus we're going to use the AF AE
lock<00:00:28.439> button<00:00:28.830> on<00:00:28.980> the<00:00:29.220> back<00:00:29.369> of<00:00:29.580> the<00:00:29.640> camera<00:00:29.849> so

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
lock button on the back of the camera so

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.630 
lock button on the back of the camera so
it's<00:00:30.779> this<00:00:31.019> kind<00:00:31.230> of<00:00:31.349> idea<00:00:31.710> where<00:00:31.920> you<00:00:32.369> focus

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
it's this kind of idea where you focus

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.780 
it's this kind of idea where you focus
here<00:00:33.090> and<00:00:33.239> make<00:00:33.690> the<00:00:33.840> shot<00:00:34.020> here<00:00:34.410> and<00:00:34.530> a<00:00:34.670> lot<00:00:35.670> of

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
here and make the shot here and a lot of

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.729 
here and make the shot here and a lot of
sports<00:00:36.000> photographers<00:00:36.630> use<00:00:36.899> that<00:00:37.170> a<00:00:37.380> lot<00:00:37.620> of

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
sports photographers use that a lot of

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.410 
sports photographers use that a lot of
nature<00:00:37.890> photographers<00:00:38.610> use<00:00:38.820> that<00:00:39.030> especially

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
nature photographers use that especially

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.139 
nature photographers use that especially
for<00:00:39.570> wildlife<00:00:40.050> and<00:00:40.550> and<00:00:41.550> you<00:00:41.700> basically<00:00:41.969> get

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
for wildlife and and you basically get

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:43.520 
for wildlife and and you basically get
the<00:00:42.210> best<00:00:42.540> of<00:00:42.690> both<00:00:42.870> worlds<00:00:43.200> you<00:00:43.290> get<00:00:43.440> the

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
the best of both worlds you get the

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.850 
the best of both worlds you get the
benefits<00:00:43.950> of<00:00:44.100> the<00:00:44.190> continuous<00:00:44.940> autofocus<00:00:45.270> and

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:45.860 
benefits of the continuous autofocus and

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:49.729 
benefits of the continuous autofocus and
in<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:46.980> case<00:00:47.160> of<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:47.460> Lumix<00:00:47.760> G<00:00:47.940> H<00:00:48.090> 3<00:00:48.590> you<00:00:49.590> get

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
in the case of the Lumix G H 3 you get

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.250 
in the case of the Lumix G H 3 you get
predictive<00:00:50.340> autofocus<00:00:51.300> so<00:00:51.480> if<00:00:51.600> I've<00:00:51.780> got<00:00:52.079> my

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
predictive autofocus so if I've got my

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.910 
predictive autofocus so if I've got my
subject<00:00:52.860> in<00:00:53.789> my<00:00:54.149> focus<00:00:54.539> area<00:00:54.750> and<00:00:55.110> he's<00:00:55.590> moving

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
subject in my focus area and he's moving

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.590 
subject in my focus area and he's moving
and<00:00:56.219> I'm<00:00:56.309> holding<00:00:56.699> down<00:00:56.730> that<00:00:57.090> back<00:00:57.300> button

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
and I'm holding down that back button

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.869 
and I'm holding down that back button
for<00:00:58.109> the<00:00:58.199> continuous<00:00:58.710> autofocus<00:00:58.980> the<00:00:59.550> camera

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
for the continuous autofocus the camera

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.389 
for the continuous autofocus the camera
is<00:01:00.030> going<00:01:00.239> to<00:01:00.440> predictively<00:01:01.440> try<00:01:01.920> to<00:01:01.980> keep<00:01:02.219> him

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
is going to predictively try to keep him

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.179 
is going to predictively try to keep him
in<00:01:02.550> focus<00:01:02.940> so<00:01:03.120> it's<00:01:03.870> basically<00:01:04.680> focused

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
in focus so it's basically focused

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:06.620 
in focus so it's basically focused
tracking<00:01:05.670> without<00:01:06.030> using<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.479> focus

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
tracking without using the focus

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.390 
tracking without using the focus
tracking<00:01:07.200> setting<00:01:07.590> and<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.400> AF<00:01:08.700> modes<00:01:09.000> so

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:10.400 
tracking setting and the AF modes so

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.260 
tracking setting and the AF modes so

one<00:02:06.299> more<00:02:06.630> thing<00:02:06.869> I'm<00:02:07.049> going<00:02:07.229> to<00:02:07.380> change<00:02:07.890> and

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
one more thing I'm going to change and

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:13.730 
one more thing I'm going to change and
that<00:02:10.619> is<00:02:10.890> the<00:02:11.310> focus<00:02:11.879> and<00:02:12.120> release<00:02:12.420> priority

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
that is the focus and release priority

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.130 
that is the focus and release priority
and<00:02:13.830> by<00:02:14.310> default<00:02:14.640> it's<00:02:14.940> on<00:02:15.090> release<00:02:15.540> so<00:02:15.930> when

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
and by default it's on release so when

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:17.930 
and by default it's on release so when
I'm<00:02:16.290> in<00:02:16.320> continuous<00:02:16.980> autofocus<00:02:17.280> what<00:02:17.790> that

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
I'm in continuous autofocus what that

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.460 
I'm in continuous autofocus what that
means<00:02:18.120> is<00:02:18.330> the<00:02:18.450> camera<00:02:18.750> is<00:02:18.870> going<00:02:19.020> to<00:02:19.140> want<00:02:19.380> to

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
means is the camera is going to want to

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.500 
means is the camera is going to want to
trip<00:02:20.070> the<00:02:20.190> shutter<00:02:20.430> whether<00:02:20.940> or<00:02:21.120> not<00:02:21.210> it's<00:02:21.390> in

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
trip the shutter whether or not it's in

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.610 
trip the shutter whether or not it's in
focus<00:02:21.770> if<00:02:22.770> I<00:02:22.980> change<00:02:23.340> that<00:02:23.460> to<00:02:24.000> focus<00:02:24.690> now<00:02:25.410> in

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
focus if I change that to focus now in

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.500 
focus if I change that to focus now in
continuous<00:02:26.220> autofocus<00:02:26.550> the<00:02:27.060> camera<00:02:27.360> will

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
continuous autofocus the camera will

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.840 
continuous autofocus the camera will
predictively<00:02:28.110> try<00:02:28.500> to<00:02:28.560> focus<00:02:28.860> on<00:02:29.220> your

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
predictively try to focus on your

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:32.090 
predictively try to focus on your
subject<00:02:30.060> and<00:02:30.540> keep<00:02:30.990> your<00:02:31.200> moving<00:02:31.530> subject<00:02:31.980> in

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
subject and keep your moving subject in

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.820 
subject and keep your moving subject in
focus<00:02:32.520> so<00:02:32.700> it's<00:02:33.150> basically<00:02:33.570> doing<00:02:34.230> tracking

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
focus so it's basically doing tracking

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.420 
focus so it's basically doing tracking
autofocus<00:02:36.530> now<00:02:37.530> there's<00:02:37.710> one<00:02:37.890> other<00:02:37.920> setting

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
autofocus now there's one other setting

I'm in one area now I don't want to use

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.960 
I'm in one area now I don't want to use
focus<00:02:49.320> tracking<00:02:50.010> because<00:02:50.280> it's<00:02:50.460> really<00:02:50.640> hard

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
focus tracking because it's really hard

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.790 
focus tracking because it's really hard
to<00:02:51.120> lock<00:02:51.300> on<00:02:51.600> that<00:02:51.630> tracking<00:02:52.320> especially

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
to lock on that tracking especially

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.100 
to lock on that tracking especially
suiting<00:02:53.130> something<00:02:53.460> like<00:02:53.610> wildlife<00:02:54.000> or<00:02:54.330> like

suiting something like wildlife or like
a<00:02:55.410> hockey<00:02:55.680> game<00:02:55.920> for<00:02:56.160> example<00:02:56.840> your<00:02:57.840> subjects

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
a hockey game for example your subjects

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:59.780 
a hockey game for example your subjects
are<00:02:58.350> moving<00:02:58.620> so<00:02:58.830> fast<00:02:59.070> that<00:02:59.280> it's<00:02:59.490> going<00:02:59.610> to<00:02:59.670> be

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
are moving so fast that it's going to be

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:01.640 
are moving so fast that it's going to be
hard<00:03:00.000> to<00:03:00.120> think<00:03:00.300> about<00:03:00.450> well<00:03:01.230> let<00:03:01.350> me<00:03:01.440> touch

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
hard to think about well let me touch

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.160 
hard to think about well let me touch
that<00:03:01.860> subject<00:03:02.370> and<00:03:02.550> track<00:03:02.850> it<00:03:03.060> etc<00:03:03.510> so<00:03:03.990> I<00:03:04.020> just

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
that subject and track it etc so I just

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:07.040 
that subject and track it etc so I just
use<00:03:04.470> one<00:03:04.710> area<00:03:05.070> auto<00:03:05.400> focus<00:03:05.970> and<00:03:06.120> then<00:03:06.630> I<00:03:06.660> use

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.050 
use one area auto focus and then I use

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:08.890 
use one area auto focus and then I use
that<00:03:07.260> back<00:03:07.500> button<00:03:07.740> autofocus<00:03:07.950> to

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:08.900 
that back button autofocus to

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:12.970 
that back button autofocus to
predictively<00:03:09.900> keep<00:03:10.620> my<00:03:10.740> subject<00:03:11.190> in<00:03:11.310> focus

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:12.980 
predictively keep my subject in focus

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:15.500 
predictively keep my subject in focus
okay<00:03:13.980> so<00:03:14.040> that's<00:03:14.310> how<00:03:14.490> to<00:03:14.550> set<00:03:14.850> up<00:03:14.910> back<00:03:15.210> button

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
okay so that's how to set up back button

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.300 
okay so that's how to set up back button
autofocus<00:03:15.630> on<00:03:16.260> your<00:03:16.470> lumix<00:03:16.740> camera<00:03:17.070> now<00:03:17.250> I'm

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
autofocus on your lumix camera now I'm

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:18.620 
autofocus on your lumix camera now I'm
going<00:03:17.430> to<00:03:17.490> talk<00:03:17.610> about<00:03:17.640> why<00:03:18.090> you<00:03:18.150> might<00:03:18.330> want

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
going to talk about why you might want

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:20.180 
going to talk about why you might want
to<00:03:18.660> do<00:03:18.780> that<00:03:18.810> and<00:03:19.500> I'm<00:03:19.620> going<00:03:19.740> to<00:03:19.770> use<00:03:19.920> a<00:03:19.950> hockey

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
to do that and I'm going to use a hockey

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:22.130 
to do that and I'm going to use a hockey
game<00:03:20.430> ends<00:03:20.670> as<00:03:20.850> an<00:03:21.150> example<00:03:21.510> because<00:03:21.930> that's

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
game ends as an example because that's

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:23.510 
game ends as an example because that's
the<00:03:22.320> most<00:03:22.500> recent<00:03:22.890> thing<00:03:23.010> that<00:03:23.160> I've<00:03:23.280> shot

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:23.520 
the most recent thing that I've shot

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:27.170

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220 
down I can shoot or I can not shoot but

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:01.160 
down I can shoot or I can not shoot but
either<00:03:59.430> way<00:03:59.700> the<00:03:59.940> camera<00:04:00.300> is<00:04:00.450> trying<00:04:00.810> to<00:04:00.960> keep

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:01.170 
either way the camera is trying to keep

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:03.590 
either way the camera is trying to keep
my<00:04:01.320> subject<00:04:01.830> in<00:04:01.980> sharp<00:04:02.280> focus<00:04:02.340> so<00:04:03.120> in<00:04:03.450> that

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:03.600 
my subject in sharp focus so in that

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:05.660 
my subject in sharp focus so in that
case<00:04:03.870> I<00:04:04.110> take<00:04:04.290> advantage<00:04:04.470> of<00:04:04.980> the<00:04:05.130> continuous

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:05.670 
case I take advantage of the continuous

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:08.030 
case I take advantage of the continuous
auto<00:04:05.880> focus<00:04:05.970> and<00:04:06.480> the<00:04:06.720> focus<00:04:06.750> priority<00:04:07.560> just

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
auto focus and the focus priority just

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.010 
auto focus and the focus priority just
like<00:04:08.220> I<00:04:08.370> would<00:04:08.430> if<00:04:08.790> the<00:04:09.210> auto<00:04:09.360> focus<00:04:09.600> was<00:04:09.990> on

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:10.020 
like I would if the auto focus was on

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:13.550 
like I would if the auto focus was on
the<00:04:10.140> shutter<00:04:10.440> release<00:04:11.480> on<00:04:12.480> the<00:04:12.900> other<00:04:13.020> hand<00:04:13.320> if

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 
the shutter release on the other hand if

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.380 
the shutter release on the other hand if
I<00:04:13.980> want<00:04:14.100> to<00:04:14.250> take<00:04:14.370> a<00:04:14.400> picture<00:04:14.670> say<00:04:15.030> of<00:04:15.240> the

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:15.390 
I want to take a picture say of the

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:18.289 
I want to take a picture say of the
goaltender<00:04:15.960> making<00:04:16.320> a<00:04:16.410> save<00:04:16.680> okay<00:04:17.370> I<00:04:17.549> can<00:04:18.030> lock

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:18.299 
goaltender making a save okay I can lock

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:20.390 
goaltender making a save okay I can lock
focus<00:04:18.600> on<00:04:19.020> the<00:04:19.170> goaltender<00:04:19.710> and<00:04:19.830> then<00:04:20.160> I<00:04:20.250> can

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 
focus on the goaltender and then I can

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.130 
focus on the goaltender and then I can
just<00:04:20.549> take<00:04:20.640> my<00:04:20.910> finger<00:04:21.270> off<00:04:21.299> of<00:04:21.480> the<00:04:21.690> autofocus

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:22.140 
just take my finger off of the autofocus

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:24.740 
just take my finger off of the autofocus
button<00:04:22.650> and<00:04:22.830> then<00:04:23.610> I'm<00:04:23.820> just<00:04:24.330> using<00:04:24.540> the

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:24.750 
button and then I'm just using the

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:26.270 
button and then I'm just using the
shutter<00:04:24.990> release<00:04:25.350> and<00:04:25.380> I<00:04:25.710> get<00:04:25.860> a<00:04:25.890> little<00:04:26.190> bit

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280 
shutter release and I get a little bit

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:27.440 
shutter release and I get a little bit
higher<00:04:26.460> frame<00:04:26.820> rate<00:04:27.000> because<00:04:27.270> the

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:27.450 
higher frame rate because the

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:29.120 
higher frame rate because the
cameras<00:04:27.810> not<00:04:27.990> trying<00:04:28.290> to<00:04:28.380> track<00:04:28.590> focus<00:04:28.980> in

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:29.130 
cameras not trying to track focus in

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:31.460 
cameras not trying to track focus in
between<00:04:29.430> shots<00:04:29.730> and<00:04:30.000> I<00:04:30.420> know<00:04:30.480> that<00:04:30.930> the<00:04:31.080> action

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:31.470 
between shots and I know that the action

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:33.770 
between shots and I know that the action
is<00:04:31.590> going<00:04:31.710> to<00:04:31.800> happen<00:04:32.160> around<00:04:32.850> the<00:04:33.330> goaltender

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:33.780 
is going to happen around the goaltender

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:35.600 
is going to happen around the goaltender
right<00:04:34.080> that's<00:04:34.290> my<00:04:34.470> shot<00:04:34.740> so<00:04:34.920> I<00:04:34.950> get<00:04:35.190> my<00:04:35.310> frame

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:35.610 
right that's my shot so I get my frame

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:38.870 
right that's my shot so I get my frame
together<00:04:36.080> basically<00:04:37.080> focused<00:04:37.710> a<00:04:37.830> lot<00:04:37.980> hold

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:38.880 
together basically focused a lot hold

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:41.060 
together basically focused a lot hold
the<00:04:39.030> autofocus<00:04:39.690> button<00:04:40.080> to<00:04:40.260> lock<00:04:40.470> focus<00:04:40.890> and

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:41.070 
the autofocus button to lock focus and

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:42.710 
the autofocus button to lock focus and
then<00:04:41.250> release<00:04:41.580> it<00:04:41.610> and<00:04:41.940> then<00:04:42.270> the<00:04:42.360> camera<00:04:42.660> is

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:42.720 
then release it and then the camera is

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.180 
then release it and then the camera is
not<00:04:42.810> going<00:04:42.870> to<00:04:43.050> change<00:04:43.230> focus<00:04:43.500> unless<00:04:43.860> I<00:04:44.010> tell

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:44.190 
not going to change focus unless I tell

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:46.100 
not going to change focus unless I tell
it<00:04:44.340> to<00:04:44.460> so<00:04:44.850> I<00:04:44.880> can<00:04:45.060> take<00:04:45.210> as<00:04:45.330> many<00:04:45.450> shots<00:04:45.570> as<00:04:45.990> I

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:46.110 
it to so I can take as many shots as I

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:47.510 
it to so I can take as many shots as I
want<00:04:46.350> I<00:04:46.500> don't<00:04:46.680> have<00:04:46.800> to<00:04:46.920> worry<00:04:47.100> about<00:04:47.160> where

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.520 
want I don't have to worry about where

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:50.690 
want I don't have to worry about where
that<00:04:47.670> focus<00:04:48.060> point<00:04:48.300> ends<00:04:48.630> up<00:04:48.780> and<00:04:49.340> for<00:04:50.340> example

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:50.700 
that focus point ends up and for example

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:52.850 
that focus point ends up and for example
if<00:04:51.660> you<00:04:51.990> want<00:04:52.200> to<00:04:52.230> make<00:04:52.350> a<00:04:52.380> picture<00:04:52.620> of<00:04:52.800> the

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:52.860 
if you want to make a picture of the

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:54.350 
if you want to make a picture of the
goalie<00:04:53.070> and<00:04:53.340> you<00:04:53.430> change<00:04:53.700> your<00:04:53.820> frame<00:04:54.030> just<00:04:54.240> a

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:54.360 
goalie and you change your frame just a

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.210 
goalie and you change your frame just a
little<00:04:54.570> bit<00:04:54.690> maybe<00:04:54.930> that<00:04:55.140> focus<00:04:55.470> point<00:04:55.740> moves

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:56.220 
little bit maybe that focus point moves

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:57.650 
little bit maybe that focus point moves
towards<00:04:56.550> the<00:04:56.640> background<00:04:57.090> and<00:04:57.270> then<00:04:57.360> all<00:04:57.540> of<00:04:57.570> a

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:57.660 
towards the background and then all of a

00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:59.780 
towards the background and then all of a
sudden<00:04:57.690> you<00:04:57.960> get<00:04:58.110> five<00:04:58.470> shots<00:04:59.100> in<00:04:59.250> a<00:04:59.370> row<00:04:59.400> of

00:04:59.780 --> 00:04:59.790 
sudden you get five shots in a row of

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:01.550 
sudden you get five shots in a row of
the<00:05:00.270> crowd<00:05:00.510> and<00:05:00.810> focus<00:05:01.140> behind<00:05:01.470> the

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:01.560 
the crowd and focus behind the

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:03.050 
the crowd and focus behind the
goaltender<00:05:01.950> instead<00:05:02.280> of<00:05:02.340> the<00:05:02.400> goalie<00:05:02.580> where

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:03.060 
goaltender instead of the goalie where

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:04.340 
goaltender instead of the goalie where
you<00:05:03.180> wanted<00:05:03.390> to<00:05:03.480> make<00:05:03.630> the<00:05:03.720> picture<00:05:03.990> in<00:05:04.170> the

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:04.350 
you wanted to make the picture in the

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:07.700 
you wanted to make the picture in the
first<00:05:04.530> place<00:05:04.740> so<00:05:05.460> as<00:05:06.020> you<00:05:07.020> can<00:05:07.170> see<00:05:07.230> this<00:05:07.560> is

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:07.710 
first place so as you can see this is

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:10.250 
first place so as you can see this is
also<00:05:07.890> a<00:05:08.010> great<00:05:08.220> idea<00:05:08.250> for<00:05:08.700> wildlife<00:05:09.210> that<00:05:09.900> is

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:10.260 
also a great idea for wildlife that is

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.020 
also a great idea for wildlife that is
against<00:05:10.680> a<00:05:10.740> busy<00:05:11.040> background<00:05:11.250> you<00:05:11.700> can<00:05:11.850> get

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:12.030 
against a busy background you can get

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:13.700 
against a busy background you can get
that<00:05:12.180> focus<00:05:12.390> locked<00:05:12.780> and<00:05:12.960> then<00:05:13.110> just<00:05:13.290> let<00:05:13.530> go

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:13.710 
that focus locked and then just let go

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:15.920 
that focus locked and then just let go
with<00:05:13.830> the<00:05:13.920> focus<00:05:14.250> and<00:05:14.510> use<00:05:15.510> the<00:05:15.690> shutter

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:15.930 
with the focus and use the shutter

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:17.960 
with the focus and use the shutter
release<00:05:15.990> to<00:05:16.440> trip<00:05:16.620> your<00:05:16.770> shutter<00:05:17.010> and<00:05:17.220> use

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:17.970 
release to trip your shutter and use

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:19.280 
release to trip your shutter and use
your<00:05:18.180> higher<00:05:18.360> frame<00:05:18.690> rates<00:05:18.930> in<00:05:19.080> a<00:05:19.140> lot<00:05:19.260> of

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:19.290 
your higher frame rates in a lot of

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:21.080 
your higher frame rates in a lot of
cases<00:05:19.560> because<00:05:20.010> you're<00:05:20.130> not<00:05:20.280> tracking<00:05:20.550> focus

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:21.090 
cases because you're not tracking focus

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:23.120 
cases because you're not tracking focus
in<00:05:21.240> between<00:05:21.600> shots<00:05:21.870> so<00:05:22.560> if<00:05:22.740> you<00:05:22.830> have<00:05:22.950> any
