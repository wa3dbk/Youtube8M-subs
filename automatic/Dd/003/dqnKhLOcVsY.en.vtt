00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:05.370
 Hello, I want to talk today with 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:08.519
 you about some details and nuances 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:14.940
 relate to how to wear a scarf tube either 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:18.180
 call see that scarlet wound can 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.680
 wear chaotically well that is owned and 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.230
 just like that all at once 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.529
 but there are some nuances 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:28.560
 which transform the face very well 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:31.619
 already if you wear it completely differently 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:34.969
 it can of course spread out 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:38.670
 as I previous video showed it 

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:45.719
 more on the shoulders to wear that is like this 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:50.090
 You can wear it 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:56.390
 this part is done like this 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:59.579
 it can be seen this is something that concerns not 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:02.460
 you can dress like this 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:06.240
 I want to note the most important thing is that this 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:08.580
 scarf model helps in such cases 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:12.060
 if you have some hairstyle for example 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:14.130
 either a lush cat hairstyle or not then 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:18.060
 There is if in other versions he scarf 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:20.280
 I'll show you later hairstyle will be seen 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:24.229
 better in this scarves due to the fact that 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:28.170
 here is the open width here you can it 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:30.530
 here at one time will be so well before 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:34.369
 in front you change either bottom 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:37.950
 wrap leave the contour straight 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:40.170
 either further take away that is the head 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.450
 more open and if this girls 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.880
 many bangs up to open show 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.670
 hairstyle you can open further already 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:50.130
 looks completely different either 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:54.060
 fully wrap the whole piece 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:59.670
 top and bottom, too, can as in the top 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:02:01.969
 steel so in front you already have here 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.409
 notice the details they are 

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:08.099
 minor but they are quite visually 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:10.259
 change the big picture i don't have 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:13.370
 reflection but my operator smile 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:16.379
 says that everything is fine therefore 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:19.290
 stand in front of the mirror in front of the mirror i 

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:21.420
 just show for yourself how you 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:24.989
 better like it eat eat 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:29.060
 even if you pull out your hair here 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:31.950
 does not spoil everything new by some such 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:34.470
 item and decoration if you have 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:37.319
 loose hair the same way if they 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:41.629
 will be in front of the whole swiss and that is, it 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:41.629
 it will look absolutely normal 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:51.810
 if you dissolve the hair for example here 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:54.959
 looks like this quite well from me 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:57.590
 what does the operator say well? 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:03:01.140
 looks so experiment 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:02.459
 look in the mirror at yourself and try 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:05.340
 some options 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:08.370
 there are very few tourists changing behind you 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:12.959
 everything is done but this decoupling really depends 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:15.300
 What is the thread density and knitting? 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:18.530
 that is, if thinner thread if thinner 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:21.780
 thicker you have left here 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:26.700
 the same everything here is what you change 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:29.299
 this part is either so or lemon 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.299
 backwards
