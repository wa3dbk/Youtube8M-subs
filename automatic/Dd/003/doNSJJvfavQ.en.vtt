it over and she gave it to me knowing
that<00:01:12.710> it<00:01:13.710> was<00:01:13.920> not<00:01:14.159> a<00:01:14.189> true<00:01:14.520> blue<00:01:14.790> Larkin<00:01:15.330> that

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
that it was not a true blue Larkin that

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:20.330 
that it was not a true blue Larkin that
it<00:01:16.409> had<00:01:16.650> been<00:01:17.580> colored<00:01:18.060> somehow<00:01:19.220> and<00:01:20.220> I

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
it had been colored somehow and I

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.179 
it had been colored somehow and I
thought<00:01:20.610> well<00:01:21.479> the<00:01:22.140> only<00:01:22.200> coloring<00:01:23.070> they

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
thought well the only coloring they

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.399 
thought well the only coloring they
could<00:01:23.400> use<00:01:23.640> that<00:01:24.570> wouldn't<00:01:24.900> kill<00:01:25.080> it<00:01:25.259> is

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
could use that wouldn't kill it is

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.140 
could use that wouldn't kill it is
probably<00:01:25.890> food<00:01:26.130> coloring<00:01:26.580> so<00:01:26.790> they<00:01:26.909> let's

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
probably food coloring so they let's

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.050 
probably food coloring so they let's
color<00:01:27.540> it<00:01:27.750> with<00:01:27.900> food<00:01:28.170> color<00:01:28.759> so<00:01:29.759> I<00:01:29.820> bought

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
color it with food color so I bought

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.020 
color it with food color so I bought
some<00:01:30.090> food<00:01:30.509> coloring<00:01:31.020> and<00:01:31.520> took<00:01:32.520> a<00:01:32.549> syringe

and<00:01:33.390> injected<00:01:34.380> it<00:01:34.560> into<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:34.860> stem<00:01:36.470> surprising

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
and injected it into the stem surprising

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.640 
and injected it into the stem surprising

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
from one to the other where bears they

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.550 
from one to the other where bears they
get<00:02:43.660> a<00:02:43.690> deeper<00:02:44.380> blue<00:02:45.720> but<00:02:46.720> it<00:02:46.870> kind<00:02:47.140> of<00:02:47.230> fades

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560

out<00:02:47.890> down<00:02:48.580> here<00:02:49.000> in<00:02:49.180> the<00:02:49.269> bottom

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989 
out down here in the bottom

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:53.370 
out down here in the bottom
now<00:02:50.590> maybe<00:02:50.950> originally<00:02:51.760> it<00:02:52.120> was<00:02:52.300> solid<00:02:52.840> blue<00:02:53.050> I

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:29.380 
inject the blue food coloring in with a

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:33.300 
inject the blue food coloring in with a
syringe<00:03:30.239> and<00:03:31.239> you<00:03:31.989> can<00:03:32.140> see<00:03:32.350> I<00:03:32.380> had<00:03:32.769> a<00:03:32.799> little

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
syringe and you can see I had a little

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:38.430 
syringe and you can see I had a little
bit<00:03:33.610> of<00:03:33.760> success<00:03:34.980> here<00:03:36.630> there's<00:03:37.630> well<00:03:37.989> little

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.440 
bit of success here there's well little

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:42.360 
bit of success here there's well little
blue<00:03:38.620> showing<00:03:39.989> that<00:03:40.989> I<00:03:41.049> decided<00:03:41.590> we<00:03:41.920> were<00:03:42.070> not

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.370 
blue showing that I decided we were not

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:48.060 
blue showing that I decided we were not
getting<00:03:42.870> enough<00:03:43.870> blue<00:03:44.170> into<00:03:44.920> the<00:03:45.130> stem<00:03:47.070> so

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:48.070 
getting enough blue into the stem so

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:49.710 
getting enough blue into the stem so
today<00:03:48.459> we're<00:03:48.700> going<00:03:48.880> to<00:03:49.000> try<00:03:49.150> something<00:03:49.540> else

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:49.720 
today we're going to try something else

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:53.640 
today we're going to try something else
here's<00:03:50.410> what<00:03:50.859> we're<00:03:51.070> doing<00:03:51.370> now<00:03:52.290> okay<00:03:53.290> since

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:53.650 
here's what we're doing now okay since

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:58.050 
here's what we're doing now okay since
we<00:03:53.890> could<00:03:54.100> not<00:03:54.130> get<00:03:54.519> enough<00:03:56.489> food<00:03:57.489> coloring

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.060 
we could not get enough food coloring

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:01.349 
we could not get enough food coloring
end<00:03:59.019> of<00:03:59.230> the<00:03:59.320> stem<00:03:59.620> by<00:04:00.100> injecting<00:04:00.579> it<00:04:00.880> with<00:04:01.060> a

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:01.359 
end of the stem by injecting it with a

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:05.190 
end of the stem by injecting it with a
hypodermic<00:04:01.750> needle<00:04:02.370> my<00:04:03.370> thought<00:04:03.670> is<00:04:03.989> we<00:04:04.989> need

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:05.200 
hypodermic needle my thought is we need

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:11.189 
hypodermic needle my thought is we need
to<00:04:05.640> try<00:04:06.640> to<00:04:06.780> get<00:04:08.250> some<00:04:09.250> way<00:04:09.459> to<00:04:09.519> get<00:04:09.910> this<00:04:10.199> food

00:04:11.189 --> 00:04:11.199 
to try to get some way to get this food

00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:16.140 
to try to get some way to get this food
coloring<00:04:11.739> into<00:04:12.370> this<00:04:13.150> main<00:04:13.480> stem<00:04:15.090> so<00:04:16.090> I'm

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:16.150 
coloring into this main stem so I'm

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:19.470 
coloring into this main stem so I'm
going<00:04:16.299> to<00:04:16.329> try<00:04:16.540> taking<00:04:17.049> and<00:04:17.169> cutting<00:04:18.480> into

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:19.480 
going to try taking and cutting into

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:23.520 
going to try taking and cutting into
that<00:04:19.630> stem<00:04:20.699> and<00:04:21.699> making<00:04:22.090> a<00:04:22.150> little<00:04:22.530> 45-degree

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:23.530 
that stem and making a little 45-degree

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:32.469 
that stem and making a little 45-degree
cut<00:04:23.560> here

00:04:32.469 --> 00:04:32.479 

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:37.540 

so<00:04:33.020> we've<00:04:33.439> got<00:04:33.650> an<00:04:33.770> opening<00:04:35.650> that<00:04:36.650> hopefully

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:37.550 
so we've got an opening that hopefully

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:40.749 
so we've got an opening that hopefully
that<00:04:37.870> will<00:04:38.870> suck<00:04:39.259> load<00:04:39.469> colouring<00:04:40.009> up<00:04:40.219> into

00:04:40.749 --> 00:04:40.759 
that will suck load colouring up into

00:04:40.759 --> 00:04:46.920 
that will suck load colouring up into
that<00:04:40.969> stem<00:04:41.860> I've<00:04:42.860> taken<00:04:43.129> a<00:04:44.080> little<00:04:45.080> funnel

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:46.930 
that stem I've taken a little funnel

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:51.730 
that stem I've taken a little funnel
I've<00:04:47.930> cut<00:04:48.259> that<00:04:48.469> funnel<00:04:48.949> so<00:04:49.610> it's<00:04:49.819> open<00:04:50.740> we'll

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:51.740 
I've cut that funnel so it's open we'll

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:56.619 
I've cut that funnel so it's open we'll
wrap<00:04:51.949> it<00:04:52.309> around<00:04:54.249> it<00:04:55.249> will<00:04:55.490> oh<00:04:55.610> the<00:04:55.819> cut<00:04:56.120> and

00:04:56.619 --> 00:04:56.629 
wrap it around it will oh the cut and

00:04:56.629 --> 00:04:59.369 
wrap it around it will oh the cut and
we'll<00:04:56.809> set<00:04:57.080> that<00:04:57.110> so<00:04:57.650> that<00:04:57.889> when<00:04:58.009> we<00:04:58.069> pour<00:04:58.370> the

00:04:59.369 --> 00:04:59.379 
we'll set that so that when we pour the

00:04:59.379 --> 00:05:01.869 
we'll set that so that when we pour the
that<00:05:00.379> blue<00:05:00.589> food<00:05:00.919> coloring<00:05:01.339> in<00:05:01.639> there

00:05:01.869 --> 00:05:01.879 
that blue food coloring in there

00:05:01.879 --> 00:05:05.589 
that blue food coloring in there
hopefully<00:05:02.509> that<00:05:03.259> will<00:05:03.469> suck<00:05:03.800> it<00:05:03.979> up<00:05:04.189> into<00:05:04.599> that

00:05:05.589 --> 00:05:05.599 
hopefully that will suck it up into that

00:05:05.599 --> 00:05:10.269 
hopefully that will suck it up into that
stem<00:05:07.210> now<00:05:08.210> I'm<00:05:08.360> gonna<00:05:08.569> get<00:05:08.779> some<00:05:08.990> some<00:05:09.860> sealer

00:05:10.269 --> 00:05:10.279 
stem now I'm gonna get some some sealer

00:05:10.279 --> 00:05:12.820 
stem now I'm gonna get some some sealer
and<00:05:10.729> seal<00:05:11.389> that<00:05:11.659> so<00:05:11.960> that<00:05:12.110> it<00:05:12.229> doesn't<00:05:12.620> leak

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:12.830 
and seal that so that it doesn't leak

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:14.890 
and seal that so that it doesn't leak
down<00:05:13.129> around<00:05:13.430> here<00:05:13.939> and<00:05:14.180> up<00:05:14.389> here<00:05:14.449> where<00:05:14.810> we

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:14.900 
down around here and up here where we

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:19.540 
down around here and up here where we
cut<00:05:15.199> it<00:05:15.400> so<00:05:16.400> that's<00:05:16.729> our<00:05:16.999> next<00:05:17.180> process<00:05:18.550> okay

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:19.550 
cut it so that's our next process okay

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:23.889 
cut it so that's our next process okay
when<00:05:19.909> you've<00:05:20.029> got<00:05:20.180> some<00:05:20.419> clear<00:05:21.259> silicone<00:05:22.899> and

00:05:23.889 --> 00:05:23.899 
when you've got some clear silicone and

00:05:23.899 --> 00:05:27.070 
when you've got some clear silicone and
we'll<00:05:24.199> put<00:05:24.529> some<00:05:24.740> of<00:05:24.770> that<00:05:24.860> down<00:05:25.310> in<00:05:25.699> here<00:05:26.080> to

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:27.080 
we'll put some of that down in here to

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:32.100 
we'll put some of that down in here to
seal<00:05:27.379> that<00:05:27.699> now<00:05:28.699> oK<00:05:29.330> we've<00:05:29.870> got<00:05:30.370> the<00:05:31.370> final<00:05:31.729> set

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:32.110 
seal that now oK we've got the final set

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:42.810

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:55.660 
twos and so forth anyway this is the

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:59.430

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:02.410 
and I think you can see that there is a

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:05.100 
and I think you can see that there is a
little<00:06:03.190> more<00:06:03.400> food<00:06:03.700> cuddling<00:06:04.270> get<00:06:04.510> up<00:06:04.660> getting

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:05.110 
little more food cuddling get up getting

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:08.330 
little more food cuddling get up getting
up<00:06:05.230> into<00:06:05.470> the<00:06:05.620> flower<00:06:06.510> day<00:06:07.510> three

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:08.340 
up into the flower day three

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:12.120 
up into the flower day three
again<00:06:09.340> I<00:06:09.610> believe<00:06:09.940> it's<00:06:10.450> a<00:06:10.570> little<00:06:10.840> more<00:06:11.130> color

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:12.130 
again I believe it's a little more color

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:16.020 
again I believe it's a little more color
going<00:06:12.910> on<00:06:13.120> here<00:06:13.510> and<00:06:14.440> this<00:06:14.740> one<00:06:14.950> day<00:06:15.340> four<00:06:15.700> I

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:16.030 
going on here and this one day four I

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:18.180 
going on here and this one day four I
think<00:06:16.720> this<00:06:17.140> is<00:06:17.350> the<00:06:17.470> most<00:06:17.650> we're<00:06:17.950> going<00:06:18.100> to

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:18.190 
think this is the most we're going to

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:20.130 
think this is the most we're going to
get<00:06:18.430> I<00:06:18.730> don't<00:06:19.150> think<00:06:19.450> it's<00:06:19.630> going<00:06:19.840> to<00:06:19.930> get<00:06:20.080> any

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:20.140 
get I don't think it's going to get any

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:22.970 
get I don't think it's going to get any
bluer<00:06:20.770> than<00:06:21.010> what<00:06:21.220> you<00:06:21.370> see<00:06:21.610> here<00:06:21.640> because

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:49.390 
thoughts the the orchid here is a white

00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:55.140 
thoughts the the orchid here is a white
pal<00:06:49.780> and<00:06:50.910> the<00:06:51.910> other<00:06:52.060> thought<00:06:52.440> now<00:06:53.730> how<00:06:54.730> are<00:06:54.970> we

00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:55.150

00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:01.810 
going to repair that cut in the stem and
I<00:06:59.260> think<00:06:59.560> that

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:01.820 

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:04.300 

easiest<00:07:02.360> way<00:07:02.510> to<00:07:02.660> do<00:07:03.050> that<00:07:03.290> is<00:07:03.500> I'm<00:07:04.040> going<00:07:04.250> to
