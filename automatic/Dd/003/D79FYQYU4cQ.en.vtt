so what matters most is the brushing
training<00:01:31.140> this<00:01:31.829> is<00:01:31.890> the<00:01:32.220> traditions<00:01:32.670> your

trigonometry when you don't even know
geometry<00:03:21.190> you<00:03:21.820> only<00:03:21.940> know<00:03:22.120> the<00:03:22.150> basics<00:03:22.660> first

00:03:23.009 --> 00:03:23.019 
geometry you only know the basics first

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:24.750 
geometry you only know the basics first
so<00:03:23.140> how<00:03:23.320> you<00:03:23.380> go<00:03:23.530> jump<00:03:23.830> up<00:03:23.980> to<00:03:24.010> the<00:03:24.220> high<00:03:24.370> level

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:24.760 
so how you go jump up to the high level

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.340 
so how you go jump up to the high level
you<00:03:24.850> don't<00:03:24.910> know<00:03:25.090> the<00:03:25.209> Lord<00:03:25.390> so<00:03:26.019> that's<00:03:26.230> what

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:26.350 
you don't know the Lord so that's what

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:28.080 
you don't know the Lord so that's what
I'm<00:03:26.410> telling<00:03:26.530> my<00:03:26.739> videos<00:03:27.160> how<00:03:27.340> you<00:03:27.400> go<00:03:27.610> jump<00:03:27.910> to

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 
I'm telling my videos how you go jump to

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:29.580 
I'm telling my videos how you go jump to
