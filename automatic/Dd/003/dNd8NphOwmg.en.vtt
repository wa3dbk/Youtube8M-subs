00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.940
 in this video stamp as desired 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:07.919
 our longboards in front 

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:10.469
 Here are our two longboards 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:14.639
 my longboard until the upper one i own 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:15.420
 a 1 to 60 m, it is at halt on the brand 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.600
 6 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.970
 it has a flex of two what a flex 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.560
 we'll mention the flex later 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.769
 but you can choose freely 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.000
 that's one of the best beginners board 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.539
 and the price-performance ratio 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:34.290
 It's also true when I bought it new 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:36.780
 from 150 euro costs mainz is the lower 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.730
 longboard from the brand sector 9 it has 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.800
 a flex of 1 and the stickers are 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.610
 from the previous owner but I like it 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.280
 actually very good 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.079
 the price is 250 euro what 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.329
 actually a very high price is for 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.710
 Longboard but you pay for the brand 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.719
 and actually there is much more expensive 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.870
 Longboard in total is the price 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.129
 that's why very high rate 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.629
 I actually for a cheap 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.329
 longboard like that of philipp was 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:02.640
 actually the cheapest and best for 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.159
 the price is our two roots 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.229
 dropped below longboards here is the 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.450
 axis in the word so in the deck 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.909
 taken in contrast to the top 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.000
 mount longboard where the deck on the 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.650
 Achsen is on the drobny 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.780
 longboards make it easier to push 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.210
 because you're closer to the ground and the 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.640
 Body focus is also closer to 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.689
 ground so you can speed 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.689
 increase more easily 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:32.760
 philips own 96 destination without growing 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:35.030
 i have golding site in the two axes 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:36.780
 this double-axel which you through 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:37.650
 weight shift in the curves not 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.450
 can tilt 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:46.229
 Here you can see the two boards at the 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:48.810
 weight shift compared to ours 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:52.470
 boards on different flex studies 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:55.080
 so that the flex is the rc grade at 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.500
 a word these are now in comparison 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.500
 and follow 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:02.880
 that was all information about ours 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.460
 two guys now, here are some 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.320
 tips about our departure the clips 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.060
 resting taken from two perspectives 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:12.170
 bucket with the group and then middle 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.170
 play reflex from 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:59.220
 that is the end and we hope it has 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:01.709
 you like it though it's only three and a half 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:04.080
 minutes have passed us this video circa 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:06.239
 Five hours of work cost so hope 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:09.030
 we that we value our work 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:09.540
 So if you 're upset last minute 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.640
 up 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.319
 that lets us know that you maybe 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:16.799
 can still bring a longboard video 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:19.200
 So subscribed commented and we live 

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:21.739
 every comment 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.739
 next time
