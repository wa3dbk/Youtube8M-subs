groups of three one two three one two
three<00:00:49.110> down<00:00:50.110> up<00:00:50.350> picking<00:00:50.559> so<00:00:51.460> we<00:00:51.580> have<00:00:51.760> six

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:52.090 
three down up picking so we have six

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:56.400 
three down up picking so we have six
eighth<00:00:52.270> notes<00:00:54.449> let<00:00:55.449> me<00:00:55.540> go<00:00:55.660> to<00:00:55.720> the<00:00:55.870> fifth<00:00:56.170> fret

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:56.410 
eighth notes let me go to the fifth fret

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:59.009 
eighth notes let me go to the fifth fret
on<00:00:56.470> g<00:00:56.620> and<00:00:57.400> we<00:00:57.640> play<00:00:57.820> this<00:00:58.030> six<00:00:58.269> times<00:00:58.330> this<00:00:58.870> is

00:00:59.009 --> 00:00:59.019 
on g and we play this six times this is

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:06.930 
on g and we play this six times this is
a<00:00:59.050> c-note<00:01:01.650> in<00:01:02.650> the<00:01:02.890> fourth<00:01:03.190> fret<00:01:03.550> B<00:01:04.180> note<00:01:05.940> and

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:24.410 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:31.400 

so<00:01:25.410> this<00:01:25.590> pattern<00:01:25.950> here<00:01:29.810> it<00:01:30.810> gets<00:01:30.960> played<00:01:31.260> the

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:31.410 
so this pattern here it gets played the

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:33.320 
so this pattern here it gets played the
whole<00:01:31.590> time<00:01:31.890> while<00:01:32.340> different<00:01:32.790> harmonies<00:01:33.060> are

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:33.330 
whole time while different harmonies are

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:35.030 
whole time while different harmonies are
played<00:01:33.540> over<00:01:33.570> top<00:01:33.960> of<00:01:33.990> it<00:01:34.200> and<00:01:34.620> the<00:01:34.860> first

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
played over top of it and the first

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.010

group<00:01:35.280> of<00:01:35.370> harmonies<00:01:35.790> are<00:01:36.030> major<00:01:36.570> and<00:01:36.810> minor

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
group of harmonies are major and minor

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.020 
group of harmonies are major and minor
thirds<00:01:37.410> and<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:37.950> pattern<00:01:38.250> starts<00:01:38.610> here<00:01:38.850> at

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
thirds and the pattern starts here at

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.510 
thirds and the pattern starts here at
the<00:01:39.180> fifth<00:01:39.450> fret<00:01:39.540> on<00:01:39.930> the<00:01:40.410> G<00:01:41.130> this<00:01:41.490> is<00:01:41.640> a<00:01:41.670> C<00:01:41.940> note

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:43.520 
the fifth fret on the G this is a C note

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.040 
the fifth fret on the G this is a C note
then<00:01:44.520> I<00:01:44.610> play<00:01:44.790> the<00:01:44.940> fifth<00:01:45.240> fret<00:01:45.330> of<00:01:45.540> the<00:01:45.750> B

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:46.050 
then I play the fifth fret of the B

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:49.700 
then I play the fifth fret of the B
which<00:01:46.470> is<00:01:46.710> an<00:01:46.950> e<00:01:47.070> note<00:01:47.960> you<00:01:48.960> can<00:01:49.110> also<00:01:49.170> play<00:01:49.350> the

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
which is an e note you can also play the

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.290 
which is an e note you can also play the
ninth<00:01:49.950> fret<00:01:50.160> of<00:01:50.340> G<00:01:50.460> if<00:01:50.640> you<00:01:50.730> just<00:01:50.850> want<00:01:51.060> to<00:01:51.090> stay

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:51.300 
ninth fret of G if you just want to stay

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:56.810 
ninth fret of G if you just want to stay
on<00:01:51.330> the<00:01:51.540> g<00:01:51.690> string<00:01:51.720> here<00:01:54.890> then<00:01:55.890> we<00:01:56.040> go<00:01:56.190> seventh

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
on the g string here then we go seventh

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:03.560 
on the g string here then we go seventh
fret<00:01:58.220> D<00:01:59.220> note<00:01:59.460> and<00:01:59.760> then<00:02:00.420> fourth<00:02:01.050> fret<00:02:02.270> B<00:02:03.270> note

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
fret D note and then fourth fret B note

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:08.660 
fret D note and then fourth fret B note
so<00:02:04.530> here's<00:02:04.740> that<00:02:04.860> pattern<00:02:05.850> again<00:02:07.429> it's<00:02:08.429> better

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
so here's that pattern again it's better

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.780 
so here's that pattern again it's better
G<00:02:09.170> fifth<00:02:10.170> fret<00:02:10.380> of<00:02:10.440> B<00:02:11.900> seventh<00:02:12.900> fret<00:02:13.080> of<00:02:13.140> G

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
G fifth fret of B seventh fret of G

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:25.850 
G fifth fret of B seventh fret of G
fourth<00:02:14.790> fret<00:02:15.000> of<00:02:15.030> G

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.140 

so<00:02:26.860> while<00:02:27.670> this<00:02:27.970> a<00:02:28.150> note<00:02:28.450> is<00:02:28.570> being<00:02:28.750> played

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
so while this a note is being played

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.790 
so while this a note is being played
another<00:02:31.150> guitar<00:02:31.540> is<00:02:31.690> playing<00:02:31.960> a<00:02:32.170> C<00:02:32.410> note<00:02:32.440> over

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:32.800 
another guitar is playing a C note over

another guitar is playing a C note over

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.580 
top of that and that's a minor third

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:38.790 
top of that and that's a minor third
relative<00:02:37.090> to<00:02:37.210> a<00:02:37.240> because<00:02:37.900> there's<00:02:38.230> also<00:02:38.380> a<00:02:38.530> C

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:38.800

and<00:03:33.690> be<00:03:34.690> relative<00:03:35.140> to<00:03:35.260> G<00:03:35.410> is<00:03:35.530> a<00:03:35.560> major<00:03:35.830> 3rd<00:03:36.190> so

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:36.490 
and be relative to G is a major 3rd so

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:37.590 
and be relative to G is a major 3rd so
we're<00:03:36.640> hearing<00:03:36.850> G<00:03:37.150> major

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:37.600 
we're hearing G major

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.230 
we're hearing G major
you<00:03:38.230> could<00:03:38.350> also<00:03:38.470> just<00:03:38.620> play<00:03:38.980> an<00:03:39.190> open<00:03:39.550> G<00:03:40.000> and<00:03:40.209> B

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:40.240 
you could also just play an open G and B

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:44.940 
you could also just play an open G and B
string<00:03:42.660> together<00:03:43.660> like<00:03:43.930> that<00:03:43.959> to<00:03:44.709> get<00:03:44.830> the

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:44.950 
string together like that to get the

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:48.030 
string together like that to get the
same<00:03:45.160> sound<00:03:45.400> with<00:03:45.760> one<00:03:46.000> guitar<00:03:46.350> so<00:03:47.350> the

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.040 
same sound with one guitar so the

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:50.100 
same sound with one guitar so the
pattern<00:03:48.370> really<00:03:48.520> is<00:03:48.820> for<00:03:49.450> the<00:03:49.570> major<00:03:49.750> minor

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:50.110
