00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:06.899
 hello today we would give them to make a rampla 

00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:08.820
 of fingerboard and the materials are from 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:14.099
 rubber 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:17.250
 They will say silicone carton rule bars 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:19.260
 silicone and colored cardboard 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.550
 I have already drawn the model of the ramp 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.550
 we would begin to like 

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:32.300
 once finished to the death of the ramp 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.300
 We did not know how to take others 

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:43.420
 already marked the base for the firm to the 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:43.420
 ramp 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.170
 we would start cutting it for its 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.170
 contours 

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:59.570
 once the base is cut, we will start 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.570
 paste the molds in the base 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:16.560
 we are two equal parts that will serve 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:16.560
 as they gave that they will stick in this way 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:23.680
 after having stuck to the sides 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.680
 we will reach higher states 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:31.310
 here we are in the last part of the 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.310
 ramp waiting on the deck 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:40.710
 well this is our finished dough and 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:40.710
 you can see it 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:45.530
 good and our station is our 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.250
 creation and my name emiliano beautiful and 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:48.250
