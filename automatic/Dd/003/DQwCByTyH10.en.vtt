00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
without exception there had been this

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.790 
without exception there had been this
bit<00:02:48.420> of<00:02:48.480> a<00:02:48.540> change<00:02:48.780> where<00:02:49.260> the<00:02:49.350> cars<00:02:49.560> got

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
bit of a change where the cars got

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.470 
bit of a change where the cars got
bigger<00:02:50.070> and<00:02:50.370> they<00:02:50.700> got<00:02:50.850> a<00:02:50.880> little<00:02:51.060> bit<00:02:51.239> softer

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480
