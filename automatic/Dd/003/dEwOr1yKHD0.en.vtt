00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:15.090
 Welcome to production where we speak 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.160
 of american football today 

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:19.590
 we have a special guest who is from 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.119
 Simple tour of cougars and it's called 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.130
 rodrigo pérez of the procession very well 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.050
 he will be with us explain all 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.840
 the everything you manage in your system 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.369
 both aerial terrestrial coach welcome 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.649
 official thank you very much for the invitation 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.600
 who will we give in coach production today 

00:00:31.649 --> 00:00:36.210
 I'll tell you about a pretty simple pass 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.309
 which is handled in both the nfl and the 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.260
 american college football from the usa and 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:43.140
 that nowadays is played here in Mexico 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.570
 it's the stick concept they already heard it 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.540
 rodrigo pérez postproduction let's talk about 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.280
 American football we will start the concept 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:51.810
 of a formation of two by two 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.520
 this means a training of 

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:55.079
 doubles all sectors on the side 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.770
 right and two receivers from the side 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.690
 left 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.150
 this concept runs with both 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:04.670
 internal actors on each side in this 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:07.220
 case we will start with w stick the 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:10.250
 principal 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:12.140
 altar is given as such as steak w 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:13.580
 sticks have to run is has to with 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.340
 a four-yard trajectory 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:18.620
 attacking the internal shoulder of the packaging 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.660
 external 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:23.450
 and the second one must be presented 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:24.690
 path in the jungle that is the 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:28.080
 runner 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:29.940
 the best rice center deepening to 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.560
 four flames at the height of the band 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:35.300
 he has to leave as quickly as possible 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.300
 to start precisely this the impact 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:41.450
 and the last trajectory is that of the Celtic 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:44.120
 which is the external sector your work is 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.710
 fundamental since since it continues with a 

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:47.510
 bad trajectory would break in tandil 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:50.300
 between these two receptors is the 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:52.850
 huge streak trajectory forcing the 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:54.830
 put to stay out this is how 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.440
 if I would run the play side of this 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:58.450
 stick concept 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:00.610
 now I will continue with the explanation of 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:03.040
 barça in this concept we will start 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:06.790
 with the width that has a trajectory 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:09.160
 of slam this who will stay a step 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:11.830
 and go inward reading this the 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:15.610
 image if this mba that runs with the 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:17.740
 flash from the side side places him 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:20.830
 will continue to run if this mba is 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:23.100
 keeps in this area he will stop and 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:25.660
 anna wintour not looking for space 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:27.460
 now we will go with the external factor of 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.380
 left side that would be the x the 

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:33.460
 current ahead a little more 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:35.980
 deep and orange spaces 1 2 3 and 

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:38.220
 then nothing like that is how the 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:40.800
 base of this step 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:43.470
 since we are clear about the trajectories of 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:45.470
 the place and the base side will start with 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.960
 the readings of the Koran 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:49.190
 in this case our first reading or 

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:51.530
 pre- reading 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:54.110
 to the corner where this list of 25 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:55.490
 calls our external sector we know 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:58.290
 to remember our street story 

00:02:55.490 --> 00:03:00.629
 outside 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:02.810
 treating the entity the ball here in this 

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:02.810
 space 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:06.819
 preventing you from being kind of arriving and 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:09.159
 make a play 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:11.579
 the main path of concepts the 

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:11.579
 style 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:18.430
 remember how close you have to run 42 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:20.829
 looking for an intern in the external way 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:23.579
 since with him the reading will be done 

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:26.049
 enter here defining if this linebacker 

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:29.709
 conversion out with the rice we throw 

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:31.930
 quick to style if this linebacker is 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:34.209
 keeps inside since the output of the 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:37.540
 stick is very good and we will do the long 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:39.630
 so he would be the number two and this 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:42.120
 would be the voters of the place 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:44.670
 since we are clear about the readings of the 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:46.350
 play set we will indicate what happens if this is the 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:48.090
 boarding that is here in the box or a 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:50.390
 little bit more travel depending on how 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:54.360
 adjust the defensive 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:57.890
 109 to cover the string immediately on 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:57.890
 color has to turn to see the h 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:03.360
 if this gentleman as I told you right now 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:05.760
 disappear we will have to attack 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:07.739
 here a quick inside and we would have everything 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:10.140
 the space within the field to be able 

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:13.560
 attack and make a big play 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:17.220
 in case there was that the 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:21.000
 receiver w will slip would have an evil 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:22.500
 time and is this man has to get 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.720
 if it mandates that have not been moved 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:27.030
 this area is to return 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:30.860
 and this would be an option for him with the 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:30.860
 Sea still remaining as 3 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:36.760
 what happens if we have a leader in the 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:39.730
 market 

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:42.460
 automatically the colleague knows he has 

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:44.470
 have to read the hot or fast to the 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:48.660
 external receiver that is the x that goes with 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:48.660
 the fair of three steps and rapids 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:56.270
 and so we would be the style readings 

00:04:54.139 --> 00:04:58.580
 since we have the concept readings 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:00.080
 steve this pattern will be successful and a 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:01.030
 Great pass protection and protection 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:04.550
 of passes 

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:07.639
 mike protection this means if that 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:10.210
 we assign an offensive lineman for each 

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:13.610
 defensive video is to say if we start 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:15.740
 connect you right from a to the 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:19.390
 defensive you have to change a little bit already 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:20.770
 what do you have to do 4 

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:23.500
 he has to cut this man to 

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:26.080
 to be able to create the window of the steve and of 

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:28.240
 long that the test is not complicated 

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:32.020
 we leave with the great right that 

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:35.710
 I would have staff faculty and on this side 

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:37.230
 we would have a combination since these 

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:40.310
 two 

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:44.810
 they would have these two 

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:47.180
 if this linebacker came in hole in 

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:48.950
 this hole the center would take it and the can 

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:52.250
 left to take and action his man 

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:54.620
 but if there is a crossing if this man and in 

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:56.690
 this space the center would take and this 

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:59.240
 language that comes here bottom there is something 

00:05:56.690 --> 00:06:01.220
 we would really be protected but with 

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:05.150
 reading and not essential previously 

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:07.340
 if this boarding shoots we can take it 

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:09.260
 with him with the h that would be would not be a 

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:11.360
 new trajectory since the neighborhoods 

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:14.210
 externally we do not have two receivers and the 

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:18.520
 proof we would not end the petition with 

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:18.520
 the left tackle that his man would have 

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:25.510
 and so it would be really this great pass so 

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:27.100
 effective as we have seen in the nfl 

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:29.920
 in the collegiate football of the 

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:33.130
 us and today here our soccer 

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:36.010
 American already ate with his friend Perez 

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:38.020
 explaining the concept of steak the 

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:40.120
 I really appreciate the time 

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:42.310
 I have given you coach thank you very much for 

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:44.860
 all this a greeting from the coach and Caesar 

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:47.470
 martínez de cancún who wrote for 

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:49.270
 ask for a video about trajectories types 

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:51.370
 what better than the coordinating coach 

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:53.260
 offensive champion of anef have sealed the 

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:55.570
 time the space to come and stay 

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:58.180
 a pass that looks quite simple 

00:06:55.570 --> 00:07:00.070
 but that requires a lot of reading a lot 

00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:01.990
 protection and above all with a lot 

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:03.880
 progression of the cordoba coach 

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:05.290
 Thank you very much, it does not make us know how to be 

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:07.060
 here with all of you a greeting to all 

00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:09.340
 the South American family and do not forget 

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:11.320
 give like this' production with 

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:13.300
 production we talk about American football 

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:16.800
 a greeting to chihuahua black stones 2 

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:16.800
 the touch is greetings
