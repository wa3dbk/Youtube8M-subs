chains<00:02:29.050> these<00:02:30.010> are<00:02:30.069> good<00:02:30.490> for<00:02:30.730> making<00:02:30.910> belt

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
chains these are good for making belt

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.870 
chains these are good for making belt
loops<00:02:31.660> and<00:02:31.959> as<00:02:32.380> an<00:02:32.620> alternative<00:02:32.770> to<00:02:33.550> long

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:33.880 
loops and as an alternative to long

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.840 
loops and as an alternative to long
thread<00:02:34.390> bars<00:02:34.770> the<00:02:35.770> thread<00:02:36.130> chain<00:02:36.550> is

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:36.850 
thread bars the thread chain is

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:40.740 
thread bars the thread chain is
crocheted<00:02:37.630> with<00:02:37.989> your<00:02:38.200> fingers<00:02:39.180> use<00:02:40.180> a<00:02:40.209> figure

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
crocheted with your fingers use a figure

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.770 
crocheted with your fingers use a figure
eight<00:02:40.959> knot<00:02:41.230> to<00:02:42.010> secure<00:02:42.400> the<00:02:42.580> thread<00:02:42.910> and<00:02:43.150> then

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
eight knot to secure the thread and then

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.460 
eight knot to secure the thread and then
pick<00:02:44.170> up<00:02:44.200> a<00:02:44.530> small<00:02:44.739> stitch<00:02:45.370> to<00:02:45.700> make<00:02:45.880> a<00:02:45.910> loop

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
pick up a small stitch to make a loop

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.500 
pick up a small stitch to make a loop
hold<00:02:47.470> the<00:02:47.709> loop<00:02:47.890> open<00:02:48.489> with<00:02:48.700> your<00:02:48.880> finger<00:02:49.360> and

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
hold the loop open with your finger and

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:53.190 
hold the loop open with your finger and
hold<00:02:50.200> the<00:02:50.440> needle<00:02:50.769> thread<00:02:51.130> taut<00:02:51.630> use<00:02:52.630> a<00:02:52.660> finger

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
hold the needle thread taut use a finger

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.470 
hold the needle thread taut use a finger
to<00:02:53.380> open<00:02:53.410> the<00:02:53.860> loop<00:02:54.070> and<00:02:54.310> pull<00:02:54.370> a<00:02:54.730> new<00:02:55.060> thread

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
to open the loop and pull a new thread

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.960 
to open the loop and pull a new thread
loop<00:02:55.750> through<00:02:56.140> the<00:02:56.290> first<00:02:56.560> one<00:02:56.860> allowing<00:02:57.670> the

loop through the first one allowing the
first<00:02:58.239> loop<00:02:58.600> to<00:02:58.989> slip<00:02:59.290> off<00:02:59.500> your<00:02:59.530> fingers

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
first loop to slip off your fingers

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.479 
first loop to slip off your fingers
repeat<00:03:01.480> pulling<00:03:02.350> a<00:03:02.470> new<00:03:02.650> loop<00:03:02.950> through<00:03:03.340> the

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:03.489 
repeat pulling a new loop through the

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:06.509 
repeat pulling a new loop through the

final loop of the chain and then anchor

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.289
