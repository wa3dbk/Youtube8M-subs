two pickups and a flat top so it's kind

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:49.780

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:53.800 
in the SEM built into it so it kind of

00:00:53.800 --> 00:01:01.090 
in the SEM built into it so it kind of
makes<00:00:54.800> a<00:00:55.899> transition

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:01.100 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.470 

sounds<00:01:02.100> a<00:01:02.159> lot<00:01:02.280> like<00:01:02.339> a<00:01:02.550> regular<00:01:02.850> e/m

both pickups although I think the

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:13.850 
both pickups although I think the
semi-hollow<00:01:11.630> adds<00:01:12.630> a<00:01:12.810> little<00:01:12.960> warmth<00:01:13.409> to<00:01:13.649> it<00:01:13.770> a
