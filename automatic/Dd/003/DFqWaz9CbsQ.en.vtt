the top and I'm going to test drive it

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:27.980 
the top and I'm going to test drive it
because<00:00:26.670> it<00:00:26.820> hasn't<00:00:27.060> run<00:00:27.330> in<00:00:27.359> years<00:00:27.660> and<00:00:27.810> years

experiment I've already missed around
I<00:00:41.250> had<00:00:41.760> a<00:00:41.790> sticky<00:00:42.239> decompressor<00:00:43.050> cable<00:00:43.410> which

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
I had a sticky decompressor cable which

we're<00:00:48.270> going<00:00:48.450> to<00:00:48.600> fire<00:00:48.840> it<00:00:49.050> up<00:00:49.170> so<00:00:49.829> two

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
we're going to fire it up so two

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.540 
we're going to fire it up so two
cylinders<00:00:51.030> two<00:00:51.360> decompresses<00:00:52.160> the<00:00:53.160> procedure

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
cylinders two decompresses the procedure

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.490 
cylinders two decompresses the procedure
is<00:00:53.760> quite<00:00:54.030> simple

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:57.500 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.990 

and<00:00:58.500> it's<00:00:58.649> in<00:00:58.800> blind<00:00:59.040> slug<00:00:59.309> I<00:00:59.550> don't<00:00:59.820> actually

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
and it's in blind slug I don't actually

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.250 
and it's in blind slug I don't actually
know<00:01:00.329> if<00:01:00.360> they're<00:01:00.570> working<00:01:00.600> I<00:01:00.989> kind<00:01:01.230> of

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
know if they're working I kind of

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.729 
know if they're working I kind of
assumed<00:01:01.559> they<00:01:01.710> arks<00:01:02.010> it<00:01:03.320> don't<00:01:04.320> see<00:01:04.470> why<00:01:04.619> they

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
assumed they arks it don't see why they

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:13.580 
assumed they arks it don't see why they
shouldn't<00:01:05.010> really<00:01:06.830> fun<00:01:07.830> to<00:01:07.950> run<00:01:09.650> any<00:01:12.590> like

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
shouldn't really fun to run any like

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.499 
shouldn't really fun to run any like
it's<00:01:13.770> bins<00:01:14.009> I<00:01:14.250> see<00:01:14.460> with<00:01:14.610> the<00:01:14.670> decompresses<00:01:15.300> oh

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
it's bins I see with the decompresses oh

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.960 
it's bins I see with the decompresses oh
I'm<00:01:16.470> going<00:01:16.680> to<00:01:16.740> use<00:01:17.040> two<00:01:17.190> hands<00:01:17.430> now<00:01:17.640> so

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
I'm going to use two hands now so

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.490 
I'm going to use two hands now so
Gillette<00:01:18.840> what<00:01:18.960> you'll<00:01:19.080> see<00:01:19.259> for<00:01:19.440> a<00:01:19.470> few

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
Gillette what you'll see for a few

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.080 
Gillette what you'll see for a few
moments<00:01:19.950> but<00:01:20.159> I'm<00:01:20.430> going<00:01:20.670> to<00:01:20.759> spin<00:01:20.909> it<00:01:20.940> up

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
moments but I'm going to spin it up

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:29.529 
moments but I'm going to spin it up
again<00:01:21.330> and<00:01:21.570> drop<00:01:21.960> one<00:01:22.140> of<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:22.350> decompresses

00:01:29.529 --> 00:01:29.539 

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:33.440 

it<00:01:30.539> would<00:01:30.750> help<00:01:31.220> wide<00:01:32.220> open<00:01:32.550> throttle<00:01:32.789> the

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
it would help wide open throttle the

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:34.820 
it would help wide open throttle the
throttle<00:01:33.479> is<00:01:33.930> it<00:01:34.080> makes<00:01:34.320> it<00:01:34.440> a<00:01:34.470> three<00:01:34.679> position

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:34.830 
throttle is it makes it a three position

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:38.090 
throttle is it makes it a three position
thing<00:01:35.250> off<00:01:35.520> run<00:01:36.210> and<00:01:36.539> start<00:01:37.229> so<00:01:37.649> that's<00:01:37.830> in<00:01:37.950> the

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
thing off run and start so that's in the

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.100 
thing off run and start so that's in the
run<00:01:38.280> position<00:01:38.310> it'll<00:01:38.910> start<00:01:39.179> and<00:01:39.330> go<00:01:39.420> full

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
run position it'll start and go full

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.950 
run position it'll start and go full
round<00:01:40.350> pretty<00:01:40.649> much<00:01:40.830> immediately<00:01:41.420> so<00:01:42.420> here<00:01:42.840> we

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
round pretty much immediately so here we

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:43.520 
round pretty much immediately so here we
go<00:01:43.080> again

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
go again

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.180 
go again
both<00:01:43.979> decompressed<00:01:44.640> and<00:01:45.649> you<00:01:46.649> went<00:01:46.860> too<00:01:47.009> much

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:47.190 
both decompressed and you went too much

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:51.669 
both decompressed and you went too much
but<00:01:47.550> here<00:01:47.910> we<00:01:48.000> go

00:01:51.669 --> 00:01:51.679 

00:01:51.679 --> 00:02:25.520 

and<00:01:52.679> there<00:01:52.979> we<00:01:53.070> go

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.520 

and<00:02:26.530> stop<00:02:27.930> now<00:02:28.930> that's<00:02:29.140> gonna<00:02:29.260> make<00:02:29.439> an

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
and stop now that's gonna make an

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:32.519 
and stop now that's gonna make an
interesting<00:02:29.769> ride<00:02:30.069> isn't<00:02:30.430> it
