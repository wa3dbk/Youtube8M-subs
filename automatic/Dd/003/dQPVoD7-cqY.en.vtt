jammer application which basically makes

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
it really hard for you to talk when you

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:24.859 
it really hard for you to talk when you
are<00:00:23.670> wearing<00:00:23.850> headphones<00:00:24.119> because<00:00:24.600> you<00:00:24.720> get

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
are wearing headphones because you get

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:26.779 
are wearing headphones because you get
your<00:00:25.019> voice<00:00:25.199> played<00:00:25.650> back<00:00:25.920> to<00:00:26.099> you<00:00:26.250> with<00:00:26.760> a

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
your voice played back to you with a

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.460 
your voice played back to you with a
slight<00:00:27.180> delay<00:00:27.390> which<00:00:27.750> makes<00:00:27.960> it<00:00:28.050> really<00:00:28.109> hard

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
slight delay which makes it really hard

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:29.720 
slight delay which makes it really hard
for<00:00:28.560> your<00:00:28.740> brain<00:00:28.980> to<00:00:29.189> actually<00:00:29.310> process
