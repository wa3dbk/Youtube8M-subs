00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 attention to all political opinions 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:06.080
 nor were they indifferent and he approved them 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.210
 all to leave it 

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:10.400
 his political position was to love 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:13.690
 passionately the plants but about 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.690
 all love the books 

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:22.070
 or the mundane as I know you like 

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:23.870
 bucholz and the raps in which I teach you 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:26.210
 new books it has occurred to me that you 

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:28.310
 could report the latest videos that 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:30.590
 they have come to me from editorials so that 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:32.780
 the review that I do not know when you will have the 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:35.540
 review I do not have then and ones 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:37.610
 pending but will have the first 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:39.950
 it was silver the second book of the 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:42.910
 dreams that she is also the author of rubik 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:46.190
 by the way the first part I read it to 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:48.260
 end of the sea in early April 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.839
 early April and therefore 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:54.290
 You will have the review in the huapa del 

00:00:50.839 --> 00:00:56.030
 second quarter of 2015 that will land 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:57.980
 by this channel because inside some 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:59.570
 probably weeks but the truth is 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:02.239
 I already told you that I liked it a lot 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:04.460
 It is a very fun book with a touch 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:07.100
 cool and something different so I have 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:10.550
 really want to read the second part and 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:13.430
 by the way the cover is beautiful apart 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:15.240
 of what the illustration itself is what 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:17.880
 is the drawing is like 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.759
 center that ice cream as well as the relief and 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.680
 it's super super pretty so many 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:25.080
 thank you for sending issues to the 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:28.140
 next book came to me from the publisher 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:31.740
 nighttime it's about shadows of Lisa J 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:34.380
 big and it's the second part of ashes a 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:37.860
 book that I read years ago when I 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:40.830
 they took out go and that I thought they had 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.509
 canceled the translation this happening to 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:44.460
 times they do not continue translating 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.320
 the sagas and the truth is that it bothers me 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.450
 a lot because it was a book that I loved 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:52.080
 it was very exciting of a future 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.970
 postapocalyptic with a disease that 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.950
 ravages most of the population 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.750
 up there all a tad typical of 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.970
 that time in which several 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:03.030
 books of this style but the truth is 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:06.539
 that was really hectic and the 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:08.280
 descriptions were pretty graphic to 

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:10.590
 times until developments but in certain 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.390
 As he did that get you the 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.850
 feeling of constant danger that has 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.500
 the protagonist and the truth is that 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:19.500
 really want to continue with shadows 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.840
 although I do not remember hardly what 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:25.410
 happened the details of the plot of 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:29.340
 ashes but apparently in the first 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:30.660
 pages of shadows there is as a summary 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.000
 from the previous book that seems like a 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:35.040
 super good idea that could apply 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.380
 all the editorials to the rooms in 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.990
 general last also of editions 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:42.150
 of doctor this leave early the 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:44.550
 sanderson that is the first part of a 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.380
 saga of this author about read the rhythm 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:48.300
 which is also the first part of 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:50.730
 a saga and whose teaching you will have in the 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:52.980
 rap of the second quarter of 2015 like 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:55.920
 that the first part of silver and 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:57.600
 also at number 46 of the temple of 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.730
 the thousand doors if I remember is to leave 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.560
 in the review down here the truth 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:05.490
 that I was captivated by this author's style 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:07.740
 the style and his ideas so he calls me 

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:09.120
 much the attention is encrypt and I think that 

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:10.620
 I'm going to start with this one of the three 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.270
 books that I have taught you more than anything 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:13.530
 because he is an author that last year 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:15.930
 outside the festival of Ascension 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:17.970
 science fiction literature and I this year 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:20.520
 I'm going for the first time so I do not know if the 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:24.700
 repeated but by itself 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:27.760
 to see if I can take it in this signature and 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:31.060
 I'm happy so this is all see you 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:33.990
 in the next video and until then 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:38.520
 another verb called we have and if he 

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:41.910
 the mental problems of humans 

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:43.950
 they are personified in what the author 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:47.370
 called the delirious ones is to say the 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:50.680
 melancholy the she the madness are 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:54.189
 concrete people are the constants 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:57.390
 these feelings are given 

00:03:54.189 --> 00:03:57.390
 of people for you
