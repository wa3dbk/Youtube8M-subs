community<00:00:25.699> funny<00:00:26.699> thing<00:00:26.939> is<00:00:27.119> I've<00:00:27.359> been

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
community funny thing is I've been

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.599 
community funny thing is I've been
testing<00:00:28.019> this<00:00:28.140> stuff<00:00:28.199> as<00:00:28.590> well<00:00:29.010> for<00:00:29.340> quite<00:00:29.490> a

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
testing this stuff as well for quite a

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:30.950 
testing this stuff as well for quite a
long<00:00:29.820> time<00:00:30.029> and<00:00:30.240> it<00:00:30.300> was<00:00:30.480> super<00:00:30.720> in

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
long time and it was super in

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.720 
long time and it was super in
consistence<00:00:31.560> and<00:00:31.830> we<00:00:32.070> never<00:00:32.219> get<00:00:32.460> it<00:00:32.610> to<00:00:32.640> work

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
consistence and we never get it to work

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.510 
consistence and we never get it to work
on<00:00:33.090> the<00:00:33.180> zip<00:00:33.780> crowd<00:00:34.020> and<00:00:34.260> now<00:00:34.410> I<00:00:34.440> think<00:00:34.710> with

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
on the zip crowd and now I think with

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.720 
on the zip crowd and now I think with
update<00:00:36.059> 1.8<00:00:36.630> point<00:00:36.960> 6<00:00:37.260> which<00:00:37.770> addressed<00:00:38.520> some

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
update 1.8 point 6 which addressed some

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.660 
update 1.8 point 6 which addressed some
of<00:00:38.760> the<00:00:38.940> hitbox<00:00:39.360> issues<00:00:39.899> that<00:00:40.649> now<00:00:41.250> works

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
of the hitbox issues that now works

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.459 
of the hitbox issues that now works
which<00:00:42.059> is<00:00:42.180> really<00:00:42.450> cool<00:00:42.600> so<00:00:42.809> yeah<00:00:42.989> it's<00:00:43.170> a<00:00:43.290> new

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
which is really cool so yeah it's a new

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.100 
which is really cool so yeah it's a new
fastest<00:00:44.040> way<00:00:44.250> of<00:00:44.489> item<00:00:45.149> transportation<00:00:45.960> and

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
fastest way of item transportation and

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.830 
fastest way of item transportation and
also<00:00:46.410> really<00:00:47.039> cheap<00:00:47.309> I<00:00:47.550> mean<00:00:47.969> yeah<00:00:48.450> you<00:00:48.660> can

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
also really cheap I mean yeah you can

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.500 
also really cheap I mean yeah you can
see<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.140> trick<00:00:49.350> here<00:00:49.559> on<00:00:49.739> the<00:00:50.219> right<00:00:50.940> side<00:00:51.239> you

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
see the trick here on the right side you

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.420 
see the trick here on the right side you
can<00:00:51.690> see<00:00:51.719> a<00:00:51.899> normal<00:00:52.110> ice<00:00:52.469> tunnel<00:00:52.949> for<00:00:53.100> item

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
can see a normal ice tunnel for item

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.400 
can see a normal ice tunnel for item
transportation<00:00:54.180> and<00:00:54.539> on<00:00:54.660> the<00:00:54.780> left<00:00:54.989> side<00:00:55.230> you

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
transportation and on the left side you

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.979 
transportation and on the left side you
see<00:00:55.559> the<00:00:55.680> new<00:00:55.860> concept<00:00:56.460> which<00:00:56.910> uses<00:00:57.300> stairs<00:00:57.690> as

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
see the new concept which uses stairs as

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.160 
see the new concept which uses stairs as
you<00:00:58.440> know<00:00:58.620> stairs<00:00:59.070> you<00:00:59.730> know<00:00:59.850> somehow<00:01:00.510> propel

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
you know stairs you know somehow propel

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.869 
you know stairs you know somehow propel
blocks<00:01:01.530> for<00:01:01.800> water<00:01:02.010> there's<00:01:02.370> a<00:01:02.430> funny<00:01:02.699> effect

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
blocks for water there's a funny effect

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.700 
blocks for water there's a funny effect
in<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.420> game<00:01:03.629> of<00:01:04.019> that<00:01:04.229> you<00:01:04.379> can<00:01:04.559> bounce

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
in the game of that you can bounce

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.010 
in the game of that you can bounce
blocks<00:01:05.159> around<00:01:05.939> if<00:01:06.180> you<00:01:06.270> have<00:01:06.299> a<00:01:06.420> setup<00:01:06.869> like

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
blocks around if you have a setup like

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.940 
blocks around if you have a setup like
this<00:01:07.520> yellow<00:01:08.520> straw<00:01:08.970> block<00:01:09.210> and<00:01:09.360> you<00:01:09.420> see<00:01:09.619> so<00:01:10.619> I

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
this yellow straw block and you see so I

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.190 
this yellow straw block and you see so I
was<00:01:11.700> really<00:01:11.970> unconscious<00:01:12.540> tint<00:01:12.810> though<00:01:12.990> it

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
was really unconscious tint though it

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.830 
was really unconscious tint though it
never<00:01:13.350> really<00:01:13.770> worked<00:01:14.010> properly<00:01:14.310> but<00:01:14.729> now<00:01:15.299> it

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
never really worked properly but now it

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.200 
never really worked properly but now it
seems<00:01:16.170> to<00:01:16.320> be<00:01:16.439> stable<00:01:16.979> and<00:01:17.159> very<00:01:17.610> consistent

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
seems to be stable and very consistent

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.999 
seems to be stable and very consistent
we<00:01:18.299> did<00:01:18.479> some<00:01:18.659> tests<00:01:19.049> but<00:01:19.200> there<00:01:19.409> first<00:01:19.740> of<00:01:19.860> all

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
we did some tests but there first of all

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.070 
we did some tests but there first of all
let's<00:01:20.159> compare<00:01:20.610> the<00:01:21.119> speeds<00:01:21.479> so<00:01:21.780> we<00:01:21.930> have<00:01:22.049> a

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
let's compare the speeds so we have a

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.840 
let's compare the speeds so we have a
150<00:01:23.070> block<00:01:23.880> long<00:01:24.320> racetrack<00:01:25.320> here<00:01:25.619> and<00:01:25.799> in<00:01:26.700> the

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
150 block long racetrack here and in the

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.880 
150 block long racetrack here and in the
end<00:01:27.000> we<00:01:27.570> have<00:01:27.689> a<00:01:27.720> command<00:01:28.110> block<00:01:28.259> detection

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
end we have a command block detection

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.100 
end we have a command block detection
system<00:01:29.310> which<00:01:29.850> should<00:01:30.090> detect<00:01:30.450> which<00:01:30.810> block

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
system which should detect which block

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.499 
system which should detect which block
arrives<00:01:31.590> at<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:32.070> end<00:01:32.220> of<00:01:32.369> this<00:01:32.490> 150<00:01:33.270> block

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
arrives at the end of this 150 block

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.109 
arrives at the end of this 150 block
long<00:01:33.750> track<00:01:34.350> first<00:01:34.799> and<00:01:35.070> also<00:01:35.700> we<00:01:35.939> have<00:01:36.090> a

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
long track first and also we have a

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.609 
long track first and also we have a
little<00:01:36.420> time<00:01:36.630> I<00:01:36.659> hooked<00:01:36.960> up<00:01:37.079> so<00:01:37.140> we<00:01:37.439> can

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
little time I hooked up so we can

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.530 
little time I hooked up so we can
compare<00:01:38.070> the<00:01:38.159> tick<00:01:38.369> speeds<00:01:38.670> for<00:01:39.390> the

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
compare the tick speeds for the

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.499 
compare the tick speeds for the
traveling<00:01:40.049> distance<00:01:40.470> and<00:01:41.130> so<00:01:41.430> I'd<00:01:41.700> say<00:01:41.939> enemy

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
traveling distance and so I'd say enemy

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:47.590 
traveling distance and so I'd say enemy
do<00:01:43.079> us<00:01:43.290> the<00:01:43.590> honors<00:01:44.040> and<00:01:44.399> hits<00:01:45.180> a<00:01:45.420> the<00:01:46.229> button<00:01:46.619> a

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:47.600 
do us the honors and hits a the button a

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.830 
do us the honors and hits a the button a
button<00:01:48.600> okay<00:01:49.259> start<00:01:49.860> here<00:01:50.130> we<00:01:50.220> go

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 
button okay start here we go

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.109 
button okay start here we go
racing<00:01:52.340> there<00:01:53.340> you<00:01:53.430> go<00:01:53.549> you<00:01:53.610> can<00:01:53.700> see<00:01:53.850> the<00:01:53.970> ice

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
racing there you go you can see the ice

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.539 
racing there you go you can see the ice
block<00:01:54.450> but<00:01:54.689> the<00:01:55.290> stair<00:01:55.560> block<00:01:55.799> is<00:01:55.950> jumping<00:01:56.430> in

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
block but the stair block is jumping in

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.510 
block but the stair block is jumping in
already<00:01:56.880> way<00:01:57.210> ahead<00:01:57.240> boom<00:01:58.259> stair<00:01:59.219> blocks

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
already way ahead boom stair blocks

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.709 
already way ahead boom stair blocks
arrived<00:01:59.939> and<00:02:00.649> here<00:02:01.649> comes<00:02:01.860> the<00:02:02.009> ice<00:02:02.040> block<00:02:02.719> so

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
arrived and here comes the ice block so

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.889 
arrived and here comes the ice block so
you<00:02:03.750> can<00:02:04.170> see<00:02:04.350> clearly<00:02:04.799> faster<00:02:05.600> 266<00:02:06.600> ticks

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
you can see clearly faster 266 ticks

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.650 
you can see clearly faster 266 ticks
compared<00:02:07.439> to<00:02:07.560> 182<00:02:08.190> the<00:02:08.550> longer<00:02:09.149> the<00:02:09.239> track<00:02:09.479> is

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
compared to 182 the longer the track is

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:10.900 
compared to 182 the longer the track is
the<00:02:09.690> faster<00:02:10.289> it

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
the faster it

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:13.450 
the faster it
is<00:02:11.000> the<00:02:11.900> step<00:02:12.170> blocks<00:02:12.470> take<00:02:12.800> a<00:02:12.830> little<00:02:13.100> bit<00:02:13.280> to

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:13.460 
is the step blocks take a little bit to

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:15.430 
is the step blocks take a little bit to
take<00:02:13.640> off<00:02:13.880> but<00:02:14.120> then<00:02:14.300> they'll<00:02:14.450> start<00:02:14.780> bouncing

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
take off but then they'll start bouncing

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.200 
take off but then they'll start bouncing
you<00:02:15.620> can<00:02:15.800> see<00:02:15.980> it<00:02:16.040> better<00:02:16.250> in<00:02:16.490> a<00:02:16.640> second<00:02:17.090> part

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:17.210 
you can see it better in a second part

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:19.480 
you can see it better in a second part
of<00:02:17.330> the<00:02:17.480> video<00:02:17.630> will<00:02:17.990> show<00:02:18.200> it<00:02:18.350> and<00:02:18.500> yeah<00:02:19.220> let's

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:19.490 
of the video will show it and yeah let's

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:22.030 
of the video will show it and yeah let's
do<00:02:19.610> it<00:02:19.730> again<00:02:19.820> maybe<00:02:20.480> a<00:02:20.660> low<00:02:21.200> reset<00:02:21.650> a<00:02:21.680> timer

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
do it again maybe a low reset a timer

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.040 
do it again maybe a low reset a timer
and<00:02:22.400> yeah<00:02:23.090> let's<00:02:23.300> go<00:02:23.540> and<00:02:23.950> I<00:02:24.950> stay<00:02:25.400> back<00:02:25.610> here

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 
and yeah let's go and I stay back here

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:31.330 
and yeah let's go and I stay back here
ready<00:02:27.050> to<00:02:27.170> launch<00:02:27.530> three<00:02:28.160> two<00:02:28.850> one<00:02:29.720> launch<00:02:30.440> all

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
ready to launch three two one launch all

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.110 
ready to launch three two one launch all
right<00:02:31.550> here<00:02:31.760> we<00:02:31.880> go

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.690 

so<00:02:35.120> right<00:02:35.600> now<00:02:35.990> we<00:02:36.050> should<00:02:36.350> soon<00:02:36.950> see<00:02:36.980> the

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
so right now we should soon see the

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.410 
so right now we should soon see the
stairs<00:02:38.030> side<00:02:38.780> arrive<00:02:39.080> bang<00:02:39.610> way<00:02:40.610> faster<00:02:41.270> and

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420 
stairs side arrive bang way faster and

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:44.590 
stairs side arrive bang way faster and
it<00:02:41.600> takes<00:02:42.070> slow<00:02:43.070> ice<00:02:43.340> transport<00:02:44.000> way<00:02:44.240> longer

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:44.600 
it takes slow ice transport way longer

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.140 
it takes slow ice transport way longer
it's<00:02:44.750> quite<00:02:45.350> crazy<00:02:45.650> I'm<00:02:46.130> super<00:02:46.700> happy<00:02:46.790> that

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
it's quite crazy I'm super happy that

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.210 
it's quite crazy I'm super happy that
that<00:02:47.360> works<00:02:47.600> now<00:02:47.870> obviously<00:02:48.800> there's<00:02:49.010> one

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
that works now obviously there's one

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.700 
that works now obviously there's one
thing<00:02:49.430> you<00:02:50.180> need<00:02:50.330> to<00:02:50.480> keep<00:02:50.960> in<00:02:51.110> mind<00:02:51.140> and<00:02:51.680> this

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:51.710 
thing you need to keep in mind and this

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:53.820 
thing you need to keep in mind and this
is<00:02:51.830> how<00:02:52.010> you<00:02:52.070> align<00:02:52.490> the<00:02:52.700> stairs<00:02:52.940> right<00:02:53.210> enemy

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:53.830 
is how you align the stairs right enemy

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:57.130 
is how you align the stairs right enemy
yes<00:02:54.830> the<00:02:55.430> item<00:02:55.790> has<00:02:55.940> to<00:02:56.000> be<00:02:56.180> on<00:02:56.420> the<00:02:56.540> lower<00:02:56.810> part

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:57.140 
yes the item has to be on the lower part

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.380 
yes the item has to be on the lower part
of<00:02:57.200> the<00:02:57.350> stair<00:02:57.700> otherwise<00:02:58.700> it<00:02:58.880> won't<00:02:59.030> work<00:02:59.060> so

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390 
of the stair otherwise it won't work so

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:01.930 
of the stair otherwise it won't work so
you<00:02:59.690> have<00:02:59.810> to<00:03:00.020> align<00:03:00.440> it<00:03:00.680> properly<00:03:00.950> to<00:03:01.550> do<00:03:01.670> yeah

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:01.940 
you have to align it properly to do yeah

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:03.520 
you have to align it properly to do yeah
low<00:03:02.300> part<00:03:02.570> of<00:03:02.690> the<00:03:02.780> stair<00:03:02.960> as<00:03:03.050> you<00:03:03.200> can<00:03:03.350> see

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.530 
low part of the stair as you can see

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:06.880 
low part of the stair as you can see
here<00:03:03.740> over<00:03:03.890> there<00:03:04.990> there<00:03:05.990> is<00:03:06.140> a<00:03:06.170> solution<00:03:06.590> how

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:06.890 
here over there there is a solution how

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:08.620 
here over there there is a solution how
you<00:03:06.950> would<00:03:07.190> do<00:03:07.370> that<00:03:07.400> obviously<00:03:08.150> in<00:03:08.330> vanilla

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:08.630 
you would do that obviously in vanilla

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:10.870 
you would do that obviously in vanilla
minecraft<00:03:08.930> if<00:03:09.320> you<00:03:09.410> just<00:03:09.680> bring<00:03:10.010> the<00:03:10.610> blocks

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:10.880 
minecraft if you just bring the blocks

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:12.460 
minecraft if you just bring the blocks
around<00:03:11.060> the<00:03:11.360> bend<00:03:11.630> and<00:03:11.750> obviously<00:03:12.200> we<00:03:12.320> have<00:03:12.440> a

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470 
around the bend and obviously we have a

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:14.110 
around the bend and obviously we have a
little<00:03:12.770> test<00:03:13.010> here<00:03:13.130> to<00:03:13.400> show<00:03:13.610> that<00:03:13.790> it<00:03:13.910> works

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120 
little test here to show that it works

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.660 
little test here to show that it works
in<00:03:14.300> all<00:03:14.420> four<00:03:15.170> cardinal<00:03:15.709> directions<00:03:15.740> so<00:03:16.520> yeah

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:16.670 
in all four cardinal directions so yeah

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:18.670 
in all four cardinal directions so yeah
maybe<00:03:16.910> let's<00:03:17.150> test<00:03:17.390> this<00:03:17.570> this<00:03:18.230> track<00:03:18.530> here

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 
maybe let's test this this track here

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.710 
maybe let's test this this track here
first<00:03:19.070> and<00:03:19.370> I'll<00:03:19.459> try<00:03:19.760> to<00:03:19.790> keep<00:03:20.150> track<00:03:20.390> of<00:03:20.570> the

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720 
first and I'll try to keep track of the

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:27.100 
first and I'll try to keep track of the
blocks<00:03:21.140> so<00:03:22.240> let's<00:03:23.240> go<00:03:25.510> block<00:03:26.510> coming<00:03:26.900> in<00:03:26.990> you

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:27.110 
blocks so let's go block coming in you

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:30.820 
blocks so let's go block coming in you
see<00:03:27.260> the<00:03:27.350> bounciness<00:03:27.740> here<00:03:28.040> pom<00:03:28.760> pom<00:03:29.830> way

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:30.830 
see the bounciness here pom pom way

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:33.940 
see the bounciness here pom pom way
faster<00:03:31.430> I'll<00:03:31.610> paste<00:03:32.510> it<00:03:32.780> by<00:03:33.110> quite<00:03:33.380> a<00:03:33.410> bit<00:03:33.530> even

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:33.950 
faster I'll paste it by quite a bit even

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:35.770 
faster I'll paste it by quite a bit even
on<00:03:34.040> this<00:03:34.220> short<00:03:34.490> distance<00:03:34.940> here<00:03:35.209> it's<00:03:35.600> about

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.780 
on this short distance here it's about

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:38.560 
on this short distance here it's about
50<00:03:36.230> blocks<00:03:36.530> and<00:03:36.800> yeah<00:03:37.610> let's<00:03:37.880> let's<00:03:38.240> test<00:03:38.420> the

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:38.570 
50 blocks and yeah let's let's test the

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:40.210 
50 blocks and yeah let's let's test the
other<00:03:38.690> directions<00:03:39.140> and<00:03:39.620> then<00:03:39.800> you<00:03:39.890> can<00:03:40.040> also

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.220 
other directions and then you can also

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:42.670 
other directions and then you can also
see<00:03:40.489> the<00:03:40.610> item<00:03:41.020> alignment<00:03:42.020> here<00:03:42.140> you<00:03:42.290> can<00:03:42.470> see

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 
see the item alignment here you can see

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.979 
see the item alignment here you can see
we<00:03:42.860> just<00:03:42.890> put<00:03:43.550> it<00:03:43.670> to<00:03:43.790> the<00:03:43.910> to<00:03:44.420> the<00:03:44.510> wall

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:44.989 
we just put it to the to the wall

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:48.220 
we just put it to the to the wall
and<00:03:45.080> then<00:03:45.709> you<00:03:46.580> can<00:03:46.730> see<00:03:46.970> whoa<00:03:47.330> okay<00:03:47.690> it<00:03:47.810> is<00:03:48.050> so

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:48.230 
and then you can see whoa okay it is so

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:51.280 
and then you can see whoa okay it is so
fast<00:03:48.580> yeah<00:03:49.580> clearly<00:03:50.150> faster<00:03:50.450> let's<00:03:50.930> test<00:03:51.140> the

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:51.290 
fast yeah clearly faster let's test the

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:53.920 
fast yeah clearly faster let's test the
other<00:03:51.440> directions<00:03:51.860> to<00:03:52.280> quickly<00:03:53.209> hit<00:03:53.450> this<00:03:53.690> one

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:53.930 
other directions to quickly hit this one

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:58.960 
other directions to quickly hit this one
here<00:03:54.790> bang<00:03:55.790> oops<00:03:56.060> I<00:03:56.920> was<00:03:57.920> faster<00:03:58.370> I<00:03:58.550> locked<00:03:58.820> on

00:03:58.960 --> 00:03:58.970 
here bang oops I was faster I locked on

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:01.510 
here bang oops I was faster I locked on
first<00:03:59.270> and<00:04:00.080> yeah<00:04:00.470> you<00:04:00.560> can<00:04:00.739> now<00:04:01.070> you<00:04:01.130> can<00:04:01.340> see

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:01.520 
first and yeah you can now you can see

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:04.870 
first and yeah you can now you can see
it<00:04:01.580> nicely<00:04:01.820> how<00:04:02.540> it<00:04:02.600> outpaces<00:04:03.440> the<00:04:04.340> item<00:04:04.700> on

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:04.880 
it nicely how it outpaces the item on

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:07.090 
it nicely how it outpaces the item on
the<00:04:05.120> ice<00:04:05.239> stream<00:04:05.630> obviously<00:04:06.410> packed<00:04:06.650> eyes<00:04:06.890> or

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:07.100 
the ice stream obviously packed eyes or

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:09.850 
the ice stream obviously packed eyes or
normalize<00:04:07.520> the<00:04:08.209> same<00:04:08.420> effect<00:04:08.810> and<00:04:09.050> your<00:04:09.560> last

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:09.860 
normalize the same effect and your last

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:13.110 
normalize the same effect and your last
Direction<00:04:10.780> there<00:04:11.780> we<00:04:11.870> go

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:13.120 
Direction there we go

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:16.659 
Direction there we go
clocks<00:04:14.120> coming<00:04:14.600> in<00:04:14.810> and<00:04:15.080> then<00:04:15.890> first<00:04:16.190> ice<00:04:16.459> is

00:04:16.659 --> 00:04:16.669 
clocks coming in and then first ice is

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:18.909 
clocks coming in and then first ice is
fast<00:04:16.910> and<00:04:17.120> then<00:04:17.209> you<00:04:17.330> can<00:04:17.480> see<00:04:17.630> boom<00:04:17.930> when<00:04:18.770> the

00:04:18.909 --> 00:04:18.919 
fast and then you can see boom when the

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:22.480 
fast and then you can see boom when the
bounciness<00:04:19.340> starts<00:04:19.880> the<00:04:20.710> stairs<00:04:21.710> are<00:04:21.979> clearly

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:22.490 
bounciness starts the stairs are clearly

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:24.280 
bounciness starts the stairs are clearly
superior<00:04:22.940> and<00:04:23.210> obviously

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:24.290 
superior and obviously

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:26.050 
superior and obviously
that's<00:04:24.620> also<00:04:24.890> cheaper<00:04:25.220> right<00:04:25.400> low<00:04:25.580> Parker<00:04:26.030> I

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:26.060 
that's also cheaper right low Parker I

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:29.530 
that's also cheaper right low Parker I
mean<00:04:26.560> exact<00:04:27.560> way<00:04:27.680> better<00:04:27.920> for<00:04:28.550> example<00:04:28.970> if<00:04:29.390> you

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:29.540 
mean exact way better for example if you

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:31.420 
mean exact way better for example if you
really<00:04:29.840> want<00:04:30.020> want<00:04:30.530> to<00:04:30.620> do<00:04:30.710> an<00:04:30.800> ice<00:04:31.040> cream<00:04:31.280> you

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:31.430 
really want want to do an ice cream you

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:34.000 
really want want to do an ice cream you
have<00:04:31.490> to<00:04:31.700> get<00:04:31.970> into<00:04:32.120> touch<00:04:32.720> pick<00:04:33.140> to<00:04:33.530> get<00:04:33.830> all

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:34.010 
have to get into touch pick to get all

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:36.670 
have to get into touch pick to get all
the<00:04:34.190> eyes<00:04:34.340> or<00:04:34.700> center<00:04:35.510> shears<00:04:35.870> which<00:04:36.320> people

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:36.680 
the eyes or center shears which people

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:39.850 
the eyes or center shears which people
always<00:04:36.980> use<00:04:37.310> so<00:04:37.910> it's<00:04:38.780> like<00:04:38.990> way<00:04:39.200> easier<00:04:39.680> to

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:39.860 
always use so it's like way easier to

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:41.350 
always use so it's like way easier to
get<00:04:40.010> the<00:04:40.100> stares<00:04:40.460> because<00:04:40.640> you<00:04:40.910> can<00:04:41.060> craft

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:41.360 
get the stares because you can craft

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:43.570 
get the stares because you can craft
them<00:04:41.540> out<00:04:41.660> of<00:04:41.780> wood<00:04:41.960> or<00:04:42.160> cobble<00:04:43.160> which<00:04:43.310> is<00:04:43.430> like

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:43.580 
them out of wood or cobble which is like

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:45.160 
them out of wood or cobble which is like
one<00:04:43.820> of<00:04:43.850> the<00:04:44.030> most<00:04:44.240> common<00:04:44.600> materials<00:04:44.720> and

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:45.170 
one of the most common materials and

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:47.440 
one of the most common materials and
franco<00:04:45.680> works<00:04:46.280> works<00:04:46.760> with<00:04:46.940> all<00:04:47.120> stairs

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:47.450 
franco works works with all stairs

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:49.630 
franco works works with all stairs
obviously<00:04:48.050> for<00:04:48.680> the<00:04:48.830> for<00:04:49.190> yeah<00:04:49.400> for

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:49.640 
obviously for the for yeah for

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:51.160 
obviously for the for yeah for
comparison<00:04:50.240> reasons<00:04:50.570> we<00:04:50.660> use<00:04:50.690> the<00:04:50.990> same

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:51.170 
comparison reasons we use the same

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:53.650 
comparison reasons we use the same
stairs<00:04:51.500> here<00:04:51.710> but<00:04:51.860> doesn't<00:04:52.460> matter<00:04:52.730> and<00:04:52.970> it<00:04:53.480> is

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:53.660 
stairs here but doesn't matter and it is

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:55.660 
stairs here but doesn't matter and it is
important<00:04:54.260> though<00:04:54.440> if<00:04:54.620> you<00:04:54.740> set<00:04:54.980> up<00:04:55.160> a<00:04:55.310> thing

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:55.670 
important though if you set up a thing

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:57.280 
important though if you set up a thing
like<00:04:55.850> that<00:04:55.880> let<00:04:56.300> me<00:04:56.420> quickly<00:04:56.660> show<00:04:56.930> you<00:04:56.990> that

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:57.290 
like that let me quickly show you that

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:02.050 
like that let me quickly show you that
you<00:04:57.860> have<00:04:57.890> to<00:04:58.490> have<00:04:59.080> like<00:05:00.080> a<00:05:00.140> too<00:05:00.410> high<00:05:00.620> wall<00:05:01.060> so

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:02.060 
you have to have like a too high wall so

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:05.110 
you have to have like a too high wall so
you<00:05:02.510> know<00:05:02.630> it<00:05:02.840> has<00:05:02.900> to<00:05:03.110> be<00:05:03.140> done<00:05:03.560> like<00:05:03.770> this<00:05:04.120> so

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:05.120 
you know it has to be done like this so

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:07.900 
you know it has to be done like this so
otherwise<00:05:06.020> blocks<00:05:06.530> could<00:05:06.770> glitch<00:05:07.070> out<00:05:07.310> here<00:05:07.730> I

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:07.910 
otherwise blocks could glitch out here I

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:11.050 
otherwise blocks could glitch out here I
know<00:05:08.840> it<00:05:09.020> has<00:05:09.200> to<00:05:09.230> be<00:05:09.440> closed<00:05:09.740> off<00:05:09.980> but<00:05:10.940> that's

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:11.060 
know it has to be closed off but that's

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:13.120 
know it has to be closed off but that's
the<00:05:11.270> whole<00:05:11.420> trick<00:05:11.750> and<00:05:11.930> then<00:05:12.470> you<00:05:12.620> just<00:05:12.830> frame

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:13.130 
the whole trick and then you just frame

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:15.760 
the whole trick and then you just frame
it<00:05:13.310> in<00:05:13.460> I<00:05:13.700> mean<00:05:14.180> use<00:05:14.930> some<00:05:15.080> more<00:05:15.230> blocks<00:05:15.470> here

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:15.770 
it in I mean use some more blocks here

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:19.300 
it in I mean use some more blocks here
and<00:05:17.170> yeah<00:05:18.170> you<00:05:18.290> set<00:05:18.500> up<00:05:18.620> a<00:05:18.710> thing<00:05:18.890> like<00:05:19.070> that

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:19.310 
and yeah you set up a thing like that

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:22.630 
and yeah you set up a thing like that
then<00:05:20.210> just<00:05:20.240> a<00:05:20.630> few<00:05:20.660> water<00:05:21.020> streams<00:05:21.440> and<00:05:21.710> that's

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:22.640 
then just a few water streams and that's

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:25.240 
then just a few water streams and that's
that<00:05:22.850> in<00:05:23.330> many<00:05:23.600> cases<00:05:23.990> people<00:05:24.170> use<00:05:24.530> half<00:05:24.860> slabs

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:25.250 
that in many cases people use half slabs

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:27.970 
that in many cases people use half slabs
on<00:05:25.490> the<00:05:25.610> ice<00:05:25.730> streams<00:05:26.150> and<00:05:26.480> in<00:05:26.840> case<00:05:27.080> of<00:05:27.110> yeah

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:27.980 
on the ice streams and in case of yeah

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:30.940 
on the ice streams and in case of yeah
instead<00:05:28.580> of<00:05:28.730> the<00:05:28.910> signs<00:05:29.210> that<00:05:29.540> would<00:05:30.500> not<00:05:30.710> work

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:30.950 
instead of the signs that would not work

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:33.940 
instead of the signs that would not work
here<00:05:31.280> with<00:05:31.580> the<00:05:32.110> stairs<00:05:33.110> dreams<00:05:33.470> because<00:05:33.920> the

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:33.950 
here with the stairs dreams because the

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:36.670 
here with the stairs dreams because the
item<00:05:34.430> bounces<00:05:35.060> and<00:05:35.270> it<00:05:35.690> could<00:05:35.870> get<00:05:36.020> stuck<00:05:36.230> so

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:36.680 
item bounces and it could get stuck so

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:38.710 
item bounces and it could get stuck so
you<00:05:36.740> need<00:05:37.040> to<00:05:37.130> make<00:05:37.250> sure<00:05:37.310> to<00:05:37.670> use<00:05:38.210> signs<00:05:38.510> and

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:38.720 
you need to make sure to use signs and

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:40.720 
you need to make sure to use signs and
yeah<00:05:38.840> this<00:05:39.290> is<00:05:39.380> how<00:05:39.470> you<00:05:39.530> set<00:05:39.800> up<00:05:39.920> these<00:05:40.070> item

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:40.730 
yeah this is how you set up these item

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:42.760 
yeah this is how you set up these item
streams<00:05:41.030> really<00:05:41.600> really<00:05:41.870> useful<00:05:42.020> invention

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:42.770 
streams really really useful invention

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:45.160 
streams really really useful invention
super<00:05:43.400> happy<00:05:43.580> that<00:05:43.820> it<00:05:43.970> works<00:05:44.210> now<00:05:44.450> funky<00:05:44.960> X

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:45.170 
super happy that it works now funky X
