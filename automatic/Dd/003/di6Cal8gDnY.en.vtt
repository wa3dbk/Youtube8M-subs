00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:08.030
 when gamers here with a new tutorial 

00:00:03.779 --> 00:00:10.760
 how to make an obsidian farm 

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:13.780
 good what we need is going to continue 

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:17.090
 look is optional 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:20.480
 let's be leds are 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:22.320
 we're going to be water answer and a 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:25.750
 lava bucket 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:30.980
 because what we need is 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:34.480
 make a kind of 7 x 3 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.480
 but then I'm not short 

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:43.460
 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 and 7 we put the web in 

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:45.050
 that act mind in 4 so that it remains in 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:47.480
 to register 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:49.670
 and to not spend more water then 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:52.180
 we break this is 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:56.310
 this is all this 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:56.310
 and we put the glass 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:02.360
 and here here 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:05.830
 here we do the same 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.830
 and here we dig another 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:14.110
 here they also scratched another one this 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:16.840
 this is 2 this is going to be 2 and this 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:19.050
 it's going to be 3 deep 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:24.050
 why 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:24.050
 then when we have that we go out 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:32.789
 here 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:32.789
 now we get here and we break this 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:42.720
 ok as you see the water was left to you 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:49.380
 as if everything was with floor and under 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:49.380
 now the network and put everything around here 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.820
 good 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.890
 she has left 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:03.420
 then what we are doing 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.420
 exactly is to put the lava here 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:06.510
 watch the machine 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:13.050
 see how it is forming in obsidian 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.400
 so that you thin line 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:26.840
 because once you 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:29.300
 that if it is so that the lava can 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:32.590
 remove it as a blotter that already removed 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:32.590
 with stay makes you this one 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:40.180
 and see that we have the oxygenate stock 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:44.819
 next 100% functional is nothing with 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.819
 this can be removed like this with a little 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:51.510
 this is fully functional until the 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:51.510
 version 1.5 that is expressing right now 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:57.709
 as I told you, it works fine but they're going 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.680
 until the peak of more but it's not going to 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:03.080
 work for nothing then I want to 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:07.670
 find an obsidian farm I hope 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:10.750
 that they give the one that they comment write the 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:13.090
 favorite because sometimes 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:15.910
 who does not get lazy to go and look for a 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:19.320
 lava lake and put water on it and that's it 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:19.320
 which then go gamer
