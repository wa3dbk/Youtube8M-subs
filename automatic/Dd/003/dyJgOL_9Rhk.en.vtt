going to load quite as deep with the
shorter<00:01:23.869> length<00:01:24.080> head<00:01:24.350> when<00:01:24.560> you<00:01:24.619> extend<00:01:25.009> more

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:27.409 
of the line outside of your rod tip

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:30.399 
of the line outside of your rod tip
you'll<00:01:28.250> be<00:01:28.429> able<00:01:28.549> to<00:01:28.909> have<00:01:29.840> a<00:01:29.960> little<00:01:30.170> bit<00:01:30.259> more

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:30.409 
you'll be able to have a little bit more

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:32.080 
you'll be able to have a little bit more
line<00:01:30.679> speed<00:01:31.130> and<00:01:31.369> be<00:01:31.460> able<00:01:31.640> to<00:01:31.729> have<00:01:31.850> the<00:01:31.940> line
