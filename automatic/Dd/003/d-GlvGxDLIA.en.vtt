00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
here that sets the tension in it once we

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.660 
here that sets the tension in it once we
slide<00:00:38.520> this<00:00:38.790> away<00:00:39.239> from<00:00:39.540> the<00:00:39.629> end<00:00:40.460> we<00:00:41.460> should

see that that tightens up and puts

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:50.889 
see that that tightens up and puts
tension<00:00:44.910> in<00:00:45.210> the<00:00:45.300> shade<00:00:45.539> now<00:00:47.989> we<00:00:48.989> put<00:00:49.170> it<00:00:49.289> there

00:00:50.889 --> 00:00:50.899 
tension in the shade now we put it there

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:53.650 
tension in the shade now we put it there
and<00:00:51.899> it'll<00:00:52.050> stack<00:00:52.410> and<00:00:52.680> stay<00:00:53.039> over<00:00:53.250> there<00:00:53.370> okay

the plastic piece on there I'll remove

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.400 
the plastic piece on there I'll remove
this<00:00:59.160> in<00:00:59.370> a<00:00:59.399> second<00:00:59.760> there's<00:01:00.570> another<00:01:00.840> option

ever happening again again if we loosen
this<00:01:07.439> up<00:01:07.650> we<00:01:08.130> see<00:01:08.310> that<00:01:08.430> that<00:01:08.580> glides<00:01:08.909> over<00:01:09.380> all

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
this up we see that that glides over all

again you would have a vertical ID

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.219 
again you would have a vertical ID
that's<00:01:43.920> not<00:01:44.549> operating<00:01:45.119> properly<00:01:45.149> you<00:01:46.049> have<00:01:46.170> a

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
look for a little plastic piece in here

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.060 
look for a little plastic piece in here
that<00:01:50.549> you<00:01:50.759> can<00:01:50.939> just<00:01:50.990> slide<00:01:51.990> over<00:01:52.439> and<00:01:52.590> reset
