articulation on their Avengers action

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:26.720 
articulation on their Avengers action
figures<00:03:24.630> and<00:03:24.870> it<00:03:25.859> makes<00:03:26.010> no<00:03:26.100> sense<00:03:26.430> why<00:03:26.609> they

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
figures and it makes no sense why they

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:28.670 
figures and it makes no sense why they
took<00:03:26.819> a<00:03:26.940> step<00:03:27.150> down<00:03:27.470> especially<00:03:28.470> when<00:03:28.590> the

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
took a step down especially when the

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.500 
took a step down especially when the
Avengers<00:03:28.889> is<00:03:29.160> going<00:03:29.280> to<00:03:29.340> be<00:03:29.459> a<00:03:29.489> huge<00:03:29.910> property

to<00:03:30.750> make<00:03:30.900> money<00:03:31.650> off<00:03:31.889> of<00:03:31.980> and<00:03:32.340> action<00:03:32.639> figures

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910 
to make money off of and action figures

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:36.229 
to make money off of and action figures
so<00:03:33.840> I<00:03:33.870> decided<00:03:34.260> to<00:03:34.319> go<00:03:34.500> backwards<00:03:35.370> and<00:03:35.639> cut<00:03:36.090> out

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:36.239 
so I decided to go backwards and cut out

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:38.030 
so I decided to go backwards and cut out
articulation<00:03:37.109> points<00:03:37.470> that<00:03:37.620> they<00:03:37.709> previously
