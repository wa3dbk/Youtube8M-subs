you're<00:00:21.539> specifically<00:00:22.080> hunting<00:00:22.560> for<00:00:23.000> in-game

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:24.260 
you're specifically hunting for in-game

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.230 
you're specifically hunting for in-game
now<00:00:25.260> I've<00:00:25.410> put<00:00:25.619> together<00:00:25.710> a<00:00:26.220> few<00:00:26.340> charts<00:00:27.060> and

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
now I've put together a few charts and

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.029 
now I've put together a few charts and
tables<00:00:27.810> so<00:00:28.199> we're<00:00:28.320> going<00:00:28.410> to<00:00:28.470> take<00:00:28.650> a<00:00:28.680> look<00:00:28.920> at

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
tables so we're going to take a look at

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.030 
tables so we're going to take a look at
now<00:00:29.220> and<00:00:29.490> I<00:00:30.150> encourage<00:00:30.510> you<00:00:30.660> to<00:00:31.050> check<00:00:31.710> out<00:00:31.890> the

can<00:00:34.860> look<00:00:35.250> at<00:00:35.370> this<00:00:35.520> table<00:00:35.820> and<00:00:36.149> these<00:00:36.660> graphs

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
can look at this table and these graphs

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.680 
can look at this table and these graphs
yourself<00:00:38.059> because<00:00:39.059> it's<00:00:39.300> gonna<00:00:39.420> be<00:00:39.540> a<00:00:39.600> lot

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
yourself because it's gonna be a lot

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.290 
yourself because it's gonna be a lot
easier<00:00:39.750> than<00:00:40.230> just<00:00:40.559> watching<00:00:41.100> it<00:00:41.520> through<00:00:41.969> the

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
easier than just watching it through the

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.040 
easier than just watching it through the
video<00:00:43.670> now<00:00:44.670> we're<00:00:44.850> going<00:00:44.940> to<00:00:45.030> scroll<00:00:45.180> up<00:00:45.239> to

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
video now we're going to scroll up to

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.299 
video now we're going to scroll up to
see<00:00:46.260> what<00:00:46.530> you<00:00:46.649> would<00:00:46.739> be<00:00:46.860> presented<00:00:47.280> with

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
see what you would be presented with

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:48.500 
see what you would be presented with
when<00:00:47.670> you<00:00:47.789> first<00:00:48.000> load<00:00:48.180> into<00:00:48.420> this

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
when you first load into this

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.610 
when you first load into this
spreadsheet<00:00:49.020> we<00:00:49.320> have<00:00:49.469> three<00:00:49.890> tables<00:00:50.070> and

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:51.620 
spreadsheet we have three tables and

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:54.560 
spreadsheet we have three tables and
they<00:00:52.640> represent<00:00:53.640> various<00:00:54.149> things<00:00:54.449> but

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
they represent various things but

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.799 
they represent various things but
effectively<00:00:55.230> they're<00:00:55.559> going<00:00:55.710> to<00:00:55.770> show<00:00:55.949> how<00:00:56.309> a

00:00:56.799 --> 00:00:56.809 
effectively they're going to show how a

00:00:56.809 --> 00:00:59.240 
effectively they're going to show how a
number<00:00:57.809> of<00:00:57.960> things<00:00:58.170> scale<00:00:58.770> up<00:00:58.980> with

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
number of things scale up with

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.470 
number of things scale up with
difficulty<00:00:59.699> so<00:01:00.620> this<00:01:01.620> graph<00:01:02.010> here<00:01:02.480> depicts

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
difficulty so this graph here depicts

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.960 
difficulty so this graph here depicts
the<00:01:03.660> data<00:01:03.870> from<00:01:04.170> table<00:01:04.500> 1<00:01:04.530> in<00:01:04.920> a<00:01:05.460> manner<00:01:05.700> that's

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
the data from table 1 in a manner that's

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.840 
the data from table 1 in a manner that's
a<00:01:06.150> lot<00:01:06.330> easier<00:01:06.810> to<00:01:06.960> digest<00:01:07.170> so<00:01:07.770> we<00:01:08.490> see<00:01:08.700> as

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
a lot easier to digest so we see as

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.370 
a lot easier to digest so we see as
we're<00:01:09.030> going<00:01:09.180> up<00:01:09.299> in<00:01:09.450> difficulty<00:01:09.750> from<00:01:10.049> normal

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
we're going up in difficulty from normal

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.789 
we're going up in difficulty from normal
to<00:01:10.500> t6<00:01:11.180> monster<00:01:12.180> health<00:01:12.360> is<00:01:12.630> what<00:01:13.080> increases

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
to t6 monster health is what increases

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.179 
to t6 monster health is what increases
the<00:01:14.070> most<00:01:14.310> and<00:01:14.580> the<00:01:14.850> fastest<00:01:16.070> followed<00:01:17.070> by

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
the most and the fastest followed by

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.940 
the most and the fastest followed by
monster<00:01:17.670> damage<00:01:18.060> followed<00:01:19.049> by<00:01:19.200> gold<00:01:19.650> and<00:01:19.799> XP

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
monster damage followed by gold and XP

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.859 
monster damage followed by gold and XP
reward<00:01:20.520> and<00:01:21.409> then<00:01:22.409> we<00:01:22.619> go<00:01:22.830> down<00:01:22.860> to<00:01:23.659> the<00:01:24.659> rest

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869

you can increase the difficulty and

all based on what reward you're looking

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.440 
all based on what reward you're looking

reward is most important to you

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:37.759

if<00:02:35.370> it's<00:02:35.760> gold<00:02:36.180> and<00:02:36.420> XP<00:02:36.630> then<00:02:37.440> you're<00:02:37.620> going<00:02:37.709> to

00:02:37.759 --> 00:02:37.769 
if it's gold and XP then you're going to

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:39.050 
if it's gold and XP then you're going to
get<00:02:37.950> a<00:02:37.980> different<00:02:38.190> answer<00:02:38.459> about<00:02:38.760> what

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
get a different answer about what

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.000 
get a different answer about what
difficulty<00:02:39.540> to<00:02:39.630> play<00:02:39.810> on<00:02:39.989> then<00:02:40.590> if<00:02:40.890> you're

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
difficulty to play on then if you're

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.310 
difficulty to play on then if you're
just<00:02:41.160> looking<00:02:41.310> for<00:02:41.459> legendary<00:02:42.030> items<00:02:42.360> we're

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320 
just looking for legendary items we're

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.550 
just looking for legendary items we're
going<00:02:43.440> to<00:02:43.500> scroll<00:02:43.800> back<00:02:43.860> up<00:02:44.310> to<00:02:44.580> the<00:02:45.480> tables<00:02:45.930> so

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
going to scroll back up to the tables so

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.160 
going to scroll back up to the tables so
what<00:02:46.769> table<00:02:47.130> one<00:02:47.310> is<00:02:47.430> showing<00:02:47.640> us<00:02:47.880> is<00:02:48.060> how<00:02:48.510> the

what table one is showing us is how the

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:52.370 
what table one is showing us is how the
various<00:02:49.680> rewards<00:02:50.330> scale<00:02:51.330> up<00:02:51.540> relative<00:02:52.200> to

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
various rewards scale up relative to

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:53.960 
various rewards scale up relative to
normal<00:02:52.560> so<00:02:52.950> this<00:02:53.100> is<00:02:53.220> all<00:02:53.340> expressed<00:02:53.730> as<00:02:53.910> a

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:07.610 
percent more gold and XP so how do you

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
know if you can remain as efficient well

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.009

at torment 1 the legendary drop rate

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:44.890 
at torment 1 the legendary drop rate
increases<00:04:39.440> by<00:04:39.620> 15%<00:04:40.190> and<00:04:40.810> at<00:04:41.810> T<00:04:42.020> to<00:04:42.220> 32%<00:04:43.900> those
