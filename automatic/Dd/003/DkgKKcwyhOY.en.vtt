00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.970
 hello and welcome to 

00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:11.130
 Cornerstone you know I've never had 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:14.250
 problems with any train rides 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:16.619
 or negative late in trains or 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.680
 unattainable connection trains but 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.060
 I really have something at the beginning of the month 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:22.619
 experienced incredible and since I am in 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.510
 can have said that 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.060
 topic not far away 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.590
 The German train makes mobile in the ass 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.390
 You know, I can understand it 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.980
 if a train was delayed it was due 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.040
 of construction work on the rail network with it 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:38.010
 the whole network is getting much better and 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:41.000
 a pc can drive much faster 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.770
 but the following story 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:47.070
 sorry no it was a very warm one 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:49.920
 summer day about 36 degrees and I stood 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.090
 in würzburg at annas the train had 40 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.640
 minutes late 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.289
 yes that was shit because I was 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.050
 so my connection flight in godingen 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:00.480
 direction Brunswick rappaz because 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.940
 that was the last train would not be 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.379
 so bad if the type of goddess 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.950
 to Brunswick not the very last one 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:09.570
 had been thought as I thought I was okay 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.450
 i talk about women with that 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.400
 regional express continued from there to 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.250
 Shrek then trickled slowly the 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.930
 someday a würzburg and it 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.850
 direction hannover was my plan 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.710
 So I would be with a bit 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.509
 delay arrived at home but me 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.759
 will arrive at home but no that 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.770
 would be too easy so I went just before 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.990
 fulda the railroadman to his great 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.100
 microphone in his cabin and says it 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.200
 something like to become 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.360
 which brief hello people fill again 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.970
 Brunswick or Berlin have to go there 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:41.979
 waiting for a connecting flight which one 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:44.890
 delay for also ten 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:47.710
 minutes has this power or you the 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:53.440
 arrival side stiess is at 20 o'clock 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:55.270
 56 we arrive at 21 o'clock 43 yes 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:59.110
 a bit more than ten minutes 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:00.700
 but the change man noticed that was 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:02.770
 the last train really then 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:05.020
 berlin direction so also drove to 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:07.960
 Brunswick passing with a climb in 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:11.050
 Brunswick, of course, people are rising 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:13.959
 I too it was megawatt 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:16.900
 we wait we wait 22h we are 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:19.180
 wait it is 10 pm we wait 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:22.090
 No train will be announced at once 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:24.610
 bam bam bam strive for minutes 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26.260
 the ece hits me dead hamburg 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:28.000
 Altona you have but I do not have 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:30.880
 into it goes a small group of 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:34.780
 people down to the service point and it 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:35.680
 came to rubbings to behave he said 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.000
 I rub rubbing 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.470
 There we learned that we had passengers 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.670
 It is our own fault that we are not 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.250
 have risen to 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:44.829
 because it was a collective debt 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:46.239
 that we are not collectively in this 

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:48.519
 the train is in the direction of 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:50.950
 drove berlin east station is yes 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:53.680
 which train my ladies and gentlemen 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:54.160
 which one minutes later you found 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.320
 out 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:59.049
 Yes, the train to Berlin opens 

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:00.519
 he already before ours us 

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:02.940
 has let it out before that 

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:05.829
 gone so long waited 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:07.720
 it became later and later and later 

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:10.450
 and there were no possibilities 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:12.790
 to get along fulda I do not know 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:13.989
 200 kilometer 300 kilometer I have 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:15.370
 no idea how many kilometers from 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:26.470
 brunswick away one could 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:27.609
 Googling now 250 km so how come 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:29.470
 I certainly do not go home with me 

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:31.930
 the taxi so I wanted on my 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:34.299
 Keep old plan to come to Hannover 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:37.000
 and catch the regional express there 

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:38.769
 he was just falling a bit short 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.540
 because the train to hamburg altona already 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:41.540
 announced will be late again 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:43.610
 had around the 15th 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:45.590
 calculated below so calculated 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:47.269
 would that be exactly ten 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:48.650
 minutes before the regional press 

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:50.689
 Departing would be in Hanover 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:52.459
 Brunswick would have this idea in the 

00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:54.200
 nova but only because he 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:55.459
 I have no further delay 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.750
 So had found a way around 

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:58.220
 home to come but also the people the 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:59.209
 in fulda are the night in 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:00.890
 Berlin wanted 

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:04.310
 now has the first time with the map 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:07.129
 8 because there was no train to Berlin 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:08.480
 So that was just with pure but had 

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:10.189
 then, luckily, the people still came 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:12.439
 Announcement that another train from Hanover 

00:04:10.189 --> 00:04:16.370
 after which 90 minutes berlin proceeds to 

00:04:12.439 --> 00:04:18.259
 is late and thus waiting happy end 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:19.820
 happily got there to see where 

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:23.690
 I wanted one and a half hours too late 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:24.949
 but you know, I was not even raging 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:27.580
 that the train was late 

00:04:24.949 --> 00:04:29.660
 because I still had a possibility like 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:31.580
 to come to Brunswick otherwise 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:34.430
 but if you have a conductor franken 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:37.280
 advance the world lets out and there is one 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:38.960
 supposed connection train gives tips 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:41.419
 I mean, he can drive away 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:43.610
 that's pretty shitty then 

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:45.410
 especially because you 're around 30 people 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:48.110
 A train station that was just nothing 

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:50.240
 worth more but a plus point war the 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:51.199
 German train from me the air conditioners 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:52.880
 have not failed 

00:04:51.199 --> 00:04:54.349
 I've never had any problems with it 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:57.139
 the German train at least not 

00:04:54.349 --> 00:04:58.990
 such violent problems as this time 

00:04:57.139 --> 00:05:02.630
 because delays just happen 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:04.190
 are just there and the people are trying 

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:06.169
 yes, the connection somehow trains 

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:07.550
 to hold and that one the 

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:11.300
 connecting flight despite being late 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:13.280
 but that was just under 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:14.750
 all the hell, what do you think about that much ? 

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:17.090
 Problems with the German railway now 

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:18.320
 Apart from delays, you have 

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:19.820
 ever a problem that her somewhere 

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:22.099
 to sleep somewhere at a train station 

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:23.539
 just did not have to connect with her 

00:05:22.099 --> 00:05:24.530
 move more and that he has 

00:05:23.539 --> 00:05:26.330
 maybe last one was 

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:28.010
 any problem easy and give them the 

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:30.349
 write in comments and I'm fine 

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:32.000
 Also, please just suggest a topic 

00:05:30.349 --> 00:05:32.840
 that we will get out as soon as you reach me 

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.090
 also via twitter facebook 

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:35.949
 instagram 

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:38.290
 Every fuck in the world and so 

00:05:35.949 --> 00:05:39.669
 I'll tell you I'm out of here 

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:42.510
 See you again sometime again 

00:05:39.669 --> 00:05:42.510
 there are people
