00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:19.840
 Everyone knows what the car is doing 

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:21.880
 in short, mercedes has a strong reputation 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:23.560
 image but how is that and what makes 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:26.220
 this car stole so well that we go 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.220
 invent today 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:33.880
 this is the mercedes c180 it is it 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:34.809
 entry level model and this car costs 36 1900 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:36.730
 euros 

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:38.739
 the only additional study has are the 7 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:41.260
 automatic gearbox and winter tires and that 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:41.920
 brings the price was just over 39 million 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.440
 quite a lot of money 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.700
 especially when you realize that audi and bmw just 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.660
 ask for less money for one 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:48.490
 entry models 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:50.770
 on the other hand, this c class 

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:54.130
 extremely stable, I am very sorry 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:56.260
 wondering how he keeps in this test 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:58.540
 This Mercedes C-Class is really made 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:00.250
 to cover long distances that brand 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:02.230
 you really care about everything 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:04.360
 for example in engine that is because me 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:06.729
 an entry-level model is only 1.6 liters of engine 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.740
 with the euro where it still produces 156 hp 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:10.990
 and there is just really delicious 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:13.479
 pull in my certainly in combination 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:15.909
 with this 7-speed automatic you really have 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:17.380
 a great powertrain 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:19.659
 Mercedes claims an average 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:21.429
 fuel consumption of 1 in 17 

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:23.950
 that neat consumption comes from too 

00:01:21.429 --> 00:01:25.899
 see adjustments that mercedes-benz 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:27.310
 Blueefficiency mentions that exists under 

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:29.380
 more from start-stop 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:31.060
 and an electric power steering 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.009
 incidentally, they are with these measures 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:34.060
 not unique bmw and audi do that kind of 

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:35.560
 things too 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.450
 furthermore, the 4 behavior of this car 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.590
 really very nice comfortable 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:39.909
 it will never be week it will never be 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:41.740
 really too soft is actually exactly like 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:43.179
 you want it 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:44.799
 and it is a very nice silent word 

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:47.799
 that not all a big compliment and it 

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:49.810
 seating comfort is really excellent 

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:51.429
 well then come to the interior yes it 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.229
 all looks beautiful is whole 

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:55.090
 nicely finished and you remember this is 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:56.619
 the entry model and yet I already have whole 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.030
 many things on board as standard 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:01:59.799
 so here I have electrically operated 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:00.909
 seats I have a fully automatic 

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:02.560
 air conditioning 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:04.479
 there are parking sensors i have one 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.909
 cruise control and the meters are real 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:07.869
 very well readable but the poker 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:09.039
 a few complaints 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:11.230
 to start with, is this heater control 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:12.849
 very low which is quite dangerous should now 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:14.980
 really take my eyes off the road to 

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:16.359
 operate another thing is mercedes 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.209
 has been using a handbrake for years and that 

00:02:16.359 --> 00:02:20.560
 sitting here is difficult to operate and you 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:22.540
 often forget that you have it 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.459
 uses that incredibly irritating 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:27.849
 and finally look I'm not quite there 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:29.380
 right behind my steering wheel 

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:30.790
 Well the entry back you have to go 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:32.709
 be careful not to shoot your head off 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:34.690
 that roof line is quite low and for one 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:35.349
 car in this class you have just enough 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:36.519
 space 

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:39.609
 it actually had a little more 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:40.690
 liked another thing is this tunnel 

00:02:39.609 --> 00:02:41.950
 make sure you are actually in it 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:45.120
 can't sit in the middle so you can be here 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:45.120
 but with two adults 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:08.780
 This Mercedes-Benz C-Class is a very 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:11.180
 refined relaxed-feeling car 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:12.800
 and that also applies to the entry-level model 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:14.930
 three things stand out that is the 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:17.030
 quality and tranquility of the interior 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:19.520
 that is the combination of the body and the engine 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:20.960
 and that is comfortable handling 

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:23.150
 for adult transport only 

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:24.950
 in the rear this car is less suitable 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:28.330
 but for the rest this is Mercedes 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:28.330
 well worth its money
