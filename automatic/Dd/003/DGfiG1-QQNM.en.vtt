it<00:00:49.649> works<00:00:49.920> a<00:00:50.129> lot<00:00:50.309> better<00:00:50.640> if<00:00:50.969> you<00:00:51.270> change<00:00:51.809> the

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
it works a lot better if you change the

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.130 
it works a lot better if you change the
speed<00:00:52.440> in<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:53.280> lobby<00:00:53.510> you<00:00:54.510> know<00:00:54.629> like<00:00:54.809> where

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
speed in the lobby you know like where

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.270 
speed in the lobby you know like where
you<00:00:55.230> can<00:00:55.350> change<00:00:55.559> the<00:00:55.649> settings<00:00:56.010> for<00:00:56.070> the

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
you can change the settings for the

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.880 
you can change the settings for the
private<00:00:56.640> match<00:00:56.760> just<00:00:57.090> change<00:00:57.449> it<00:00:57.660> to<00:00:57.960> make<00:00:58.859> it

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
private match just change it to make it

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.619 
private match just change it to make it
you<00:00:59.250> to<00:00:59.760> make<00:00:59.879> it<00:00:59.969> possible<00:01:00.120> so<00:01:00.329> you<00:01:00.420> can<00:01:00.539> go

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
you to make it possible so you can go

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.360 
you to make it possible so you can go
like<00:01:00.809> a<00:01:00.840> lot<00:01:01.079> faster<00:01:01.530> just<00:01:01.559> helps<00:01:02.010> it<00:01:02.129> a<00:01:02.219> lot

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
like a lot faster just helps it a lot

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.369 
like a lot faster just helps it a lot
and<00:01:02.579> then<00:01:03.000> you<00:01:03.180> can<00:01:03.329> actually<00:01:03.600> jump<00:01:03.809> out<00:01:04.019> to<00:01:04.350> a

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
and then you can actually jump out to a

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:05.780 
and then you can actually jump out to a
part<00:01:04.799> of<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:04.920> map<00:01:05.070> over<00:01:05.280> there<00:01:05.430> where<00:01:05.580> you<00:01:05.670> can

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
part of the map over there where you can

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.050 
part of the map over there where you can
get<00:01:05.909> into<00:01:06.119> that<00:01:06.150> pool<00:01:06.450> and<00:01:06.479> swim<00:01:07.049> so<00:01:07.619> it<00:01:08.010> is<00:01:08.220> one

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
get into that pool and swim so it is one

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.310 
get into that pool and swim so it is one
thing<00:01:09.240> that<00:01:09.299> a<00:01:09.659> lot<00:01:09.810> of<00:01:09.900> people<00:01:10.110> are<00:01:10.229> wondering

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
thing that a lot of people are wondering

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.260 
thing that a lot of people are wondering
is<00:01:10.740> why<00:01:10.950> I<00:01:10.979> like<00:01:11.280> that<00:01:11.490> actually<00:01:11.729> bothered<00:01:12.060> to

but I have no idea honestly so anyway he
can<00:01:20.549> get<00:01:20.700> you<00:01:20.850> can<00:01:21.000> get<00:01:21.150> in<00:01:21.210> that<00:01:21.299> pool<00:01:21.540> over

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
can get you can get in that pool over

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.630 
can get you can get in that pool over
there<00:01:21.840> he's<00:01:22.140> going<00:01:22.290> to<00:01:22.350> show<00:01:22.500> kind<00:01:23.400> of<00:01:23.430> like<00:01:23.580> a

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
there he's going to show kind of like a

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.190 
there he's going to show kind of like a
third-person<00:01:24.030> perspective<00:01:24.060> of<00:01:24.780> it<00:01:24.930> in<00:01:25.049> a<00:01:25.170> bit

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
third-person perspective of it in a bit

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.039 
third-person perspective of it in a bit
and<00:01:25.560> then<00:01:26.250> you<00:01:26.729> can<00:01:26.759> actually<00:01:27.150> from<00:01:27.450> there<00:01:27.750> you

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
and then you can actually from there you

and then you can actually from there you
can<00:01:28.200> actually<00:01:28.350> get<00:01:28.650> under<00:01:29.520> the<00:01:29.670> map<00:01:29.850> and<00:01:30.119> like

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
can actually get under the map and like
