it the other way again making good

00:00:48.000 --> 00:01:02.000 
it the other way again making good
pieces<00:00:52.910> you<00:00:53.910> just<00:00:54.180> seem<00:00:54.390> to<00:00:54.539> decide

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:21.930 

cross<00:01:19.110> okay<00:01:20.110> now<00:01:20.560> this<00:01:20.740> part<00:01:21.010> might<00:01:21.280> seem<00:01:21.640> hard

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:21.940 
cross okay now this part might seem hard

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:26.030 
cross okay now this part might seem hard
but<00:01:22.840> really<00:01:23.350> it's<00:01:23.770> kind<00:01:23.950> of<00:01:24.040> easy<00:01:24.220> just<00:01:24.729> bold

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
but really it's kind of easy just bold

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:31.050 
but really it's kind of easy just bold
paper's<00:01:27.040> like<00:01:27.840> this<00:01:28.840> so<00:01:29.740> it's<00:01:29.950> like<00:01:30.040> just<00:01:30.940> like

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:31.060 
paper's like this so it's like just like

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.420 
paper's like this so it's like just like
grab<00:01:31.420> it<00:01:31.600> with<00:01:31.720> your<00:01:31.750> pointer<00:01:32.200> fingers<00:01:32.560> and<00:01:32.860> I

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:33.430 
grab it with your pointer fingers and I

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:37.219 
grab it with your pointer fingers and I
push<00:01:33.850> them<00:01:34.119> in<00:01:34.300> and<00:01:34.350> you<00:01:35.350> should<00:01:35.560> just<00:01:35.770> hold<00:01:36.009> in

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
push them in and you should just hold in

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:42.330 
push them in and you should just hold in
that<00:01:38.280> at<00:01:39.280> the<00:01:40.060> top<00:01:40.590> sometimes<00:01:41.590> would<00:01:41.950> go<00:01:42.190> like

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:42.340 
that at the top sometimes would go like

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:45.780 
that at the top sometimes would go like
that<00:01:42.520> so<00:01:43.360> you<00:01:43.450> just<00:01:43.869> need<00:01:44.080> a<00:01:44.110> I'd<00:01:45.100> work<00:01:45.340> it<00:01:45.550> so

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:45.790 
that so you just need a I'd work it so

00:01:45.790 --> 00:02:00.490 
that so you just need a I'd work it so
it<00:01:45.910> ends<00:01:46.300> up<00:01:46.360> like<00:01:46.570> that<00:01:48.180> increase

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:00.500 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.910 

it's<00:02:01.500> empty<00:02:01.710> with<00:02:01.950> the<00:02:01.980> other<00:02:02.220> side<00:02:03.590> you<00:02:04.590> just

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
it's empty with the other side you just

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:24.539 
it's empty with the other side you just
push<00:02:05.910> it

00:02:24.539 --> 00:02:24.549 

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:27.190 

okay<00:02:25.549> then<00:02:26.329> you're<00:02:26.450> going<00:02:26.569> to<00:02:26.629> fold<00:02:26.810> it<00:02:27.019> this

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
okay then you're going to fold it this

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.729 
okay then you're going to fold it this
way<00:02:28.329> just<00:02:29.329> like<00:02:29.480> that<00:02:29.599> you<00:02:30.049> can<00:02:30.139> fold<00:02:30.349> it<00:02:30.499> one

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:30.739 
way just like that you can fold it one

way just like that you can fold it one
way<00:02:30.920> and<00:02:31.239> get<00:02:32.239> the<00:02:32.269> corner<00:02:32.810> of<00:02:32.900> it<00:02:33.099> you<00:02:34.099> just

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
way and get the corner of it you just

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.270 
way and get the corner of it you just
pulled<00:02:34.519> it<00:02:34.670> up<00:02:34.700> to<00:02:35.329> belt<00:02:36.200> like<00:02:36.469> three<00:02:36.920> quarters

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:58.629 
you're going to fold it back on itself
just<00:02:48.079> like<00:02:48.139> that<00:02:56.799> then<00:02:57.799> you're<00:02:58.010> going<00:02:58.129> to<00:02:58.189> fold

00:02:58.629 --> 00:02:58.639

00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:06.019 
them look back that way although three

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:10.790 
them look back that way although three
closes<00:03:06.260> away

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:10.800 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:22.530 

crees<00:03:20.640> ok<00:03:21.640> then<00:03:21.880> you<00:03:21.970> open<00:03:22.270> it<00:03:22.360> back<00:03:22.480> up

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540 
crees ok then you open it back up

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:25.130 
crees ok then you open it back up
there's<00:03:23.230> two<00:03:23.410> flaps<00:03:23.680> just<00:03:24.190> open<00:03:24.340> it<00:03:24.550> back<00:03:24.700> up

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140 
there's two flaps just open it back up

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:27.600 
there's two flaps just open it back up
now<00:03:26.140> you<00:03:26.200> grab<00:03:26.350> one<00:03:26.650> corner<00:03:27.160> this<00:03:27.340> matter

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:27.610 
now you grab one corner this matter

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:31.700 
now you grab one corner this matter
which<00:03:27.820> side<00:03:28.230> one<00:03:29.230> corner<00:03:29.650> and<00:03:30.310> go<00:03:30.580> three<00:03:30.880> ways

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:31.710 
which side one corner and go three ways

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:40.380 
which side one corner and go three ways
drink<00:03:32.710> orders<00:03:33.010> the<00:03:33.130> way<00:03:38.400> and<00:03:39.400> then<00:03:40.150> same<00:03:40.360> thing

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:40.390 
drink orders the way and then same thing

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:52.670 
drink orders the way and then same thing
with<00:03:40.750> the<00:03:40.780> other<00:03:40.870> side<00:03:50.500> look<00:03:50.620> like<00:03:50.830> this

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
with the other side look like this

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:56.240 
with the other side look like this
but<00:03:53.680> they<00:03:53.860> drop<00:03:54.100> quarters<00:03:54.460> away<00:03:54.700> okay<00:03:55.510> then

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
but they drop quarters away okay then

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:03.050 
but they drop quarters away okay then
you<00:03:57.250> flip<00:03:57.580> it<00:03:57.700> over<00:03:57.850> and<00:04:00.390> fold<00:04:01.390> it<00:04:01.570> over

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
you flip it over and fold it over

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.730 
you flip it over and fold it over
there's<00:04:04.060> like<00:04:04.240> a<00:04:04.270> little<00:04:04.540> line<00:04:04.900> there<00:04:04.930> so

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:05.740 
there's like a little line there so

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:07.440 
there's like a little line there so
that's<00:04:06.070> basically<00:04:06.460> where<00:04:06.880> you<00:04:07.030> want<00:04:07.210> to<00:04:07.300> fold

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:07.450 
that's basically where you want to fold

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:16.020 
that's basically where you want to fold
it<00:04:07.660> and<00:04:13.590> you<00:04:14.590> get<00:04:14.800> the<00:04:14.980> other<00:04:15.130> side<00:04:15.370> and<00:04:15.790> fold

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.030 
it and you get the other side and fold
