00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.580
 mercedes shows the different ones here 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:58.260
 light sources from 1886 to 2014 

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:59.060
 but what is installed here in 1886 in the mercedes 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.190
 has been 

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:04.170
 yes there is still a candle in here 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.190
 you have to be there before every ride 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.870
 to be lit first 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:15.270
 1901 all have different it was 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:17.420
 a gas lamps 1915 we had here 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.400
 already an electric lighting 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:23.280
 then there was a halogen incandescent 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:28.320
 used in 1995 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:33.540
 here there was already xenon here form 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:35.720
 like 211 also ten from 2003 and here 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:39.030
 2010 the first fully dynamic 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:41.940
 LED headlights and 2014 we have here 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:44.850
 the multi beam led spotlight the 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:46.369
 today with the new generation of cls 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.500
 was presented 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:50.940
 here we have it all the time 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:56.130
 disassembled and here you see 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:59.700
 we have the 24 individual leds ever 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:02.509
 after just one individual and one 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.509
 can be turned off 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:15.360
 with the light conductor going over the 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:16.650
 damage to tense this light guide 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.780
 we use for the functions 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:21.060
 position light daytime running lights then 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.990
 Just use white lights accordingly 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:26.430
 the one with yellow leds is flashing 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:28.680
 and with blue leds we will now 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.360
 driven here 10 for coming home 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:33.330
 then you operate the vehicle 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:35.520
 driver is greeted while unlocking 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.870
 We are building the main light modules in the 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:40.800
 spotlights we have three here 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:42.420
 Distribute elements around the bottom 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.940
 with these three reflector paddles 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.380
 this reflector will shovel so 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.209
 called dipped beam basic light 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:49.920
 it has to be imagined like that 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:51.960
 a wide light carpet from the 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.240
 vehicle spans and he always 

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:56.520
 is not active then we have plans 

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:59.670
 here on the outside the dynamic 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:01.920
 led modules this module brings a 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:03.480
 part of the dipped beam 2 and is 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.700
 also for the high beam and also for 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.990
 Part of non-applications used and 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.060
 the real innovation on this 

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:11.730
 headlight system is now the raste 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.930
 Light source of this large modules with 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:16.010
 the big ones are here at the 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:18.060
 inside this module has 24 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:19.970
 High performance LEDs that are completely independent 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:22.800
 can be controlled by each other 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:24.870
 and creates one arranged in columns 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:26.880
 the high beam does not work with this case 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:28.860
 we can then be very precisely targeted and 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:30.750
 fast other traffic 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:32.970
 save or not a full fall 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:34.620
 represent and with these modules 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:37.010
 we then use the adaptive 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:37.010
 fernlicht assistants 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.810
 b 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:57.440
 placed 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:22.709
 the complete abandonment to him 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.730
 a direction 

00:04:28.969 --> 00:04:33.210
 red 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:36.440
 which is also new at the next 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:38.610
 Generation of the cls is the display 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:40.380
 who knows the predecessor knows that 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:42.920
 then has a little taken in 

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:45.720
 display that is definitely bigger now 

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:48.360
 is put on like the a class or 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:51.240
 at the c class and has a diagonal 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:53.010
 by 8 inches what a little bit me now 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:54.240
 Negatively noticed here is the 

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:56.940
 lateral gram 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:58.580
 You see, it's very thick here 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:01.290
 above it goes 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:02.610
 I do not know exactly why that is 

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:06.150
 maybe from design technical 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:07.320
 but found personally me 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:09.840
 of course better if the 

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:12.090
 Frame slightly on all sides 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:15.210
 maybe then here would have a 9 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:17.430
 or 10 inch display adapted but on 

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:21.560
 every case ever a clear 

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:21.560
 improvement over the predecessor
