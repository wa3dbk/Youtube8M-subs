00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:05.560

 they are going to give him here already so that 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:12.840

 I have it on the desk that is the 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:20.880
 bomberman 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:23.310
 let's see 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:27.210
 of agreement as kirchner I get the 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:28.260
 local disk because we have to send 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:31.820
 the room 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:31.820
 the local disk ce 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:36.810
 got damn 

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:57.240
 here I already sent the rumba to the local disk I know 

00:04:54.390 --> 00:05:00.840
 and well we re-open here 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:02.400
 let's give file and the game now and 

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:05.940
 here as they came, it's going to look like 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:10.080
 super bomberman game 2 will give you a 

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:12.750
 click and they will give it to open room 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:15.020
 and here we will be running the 

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:15.020
 egg 

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:21.250
 Let's see 

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:21.250
 are going to go to input 

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:25.780
 sorry to see in January 

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:31.620
 like the air to change them women 

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:33.490
 buttons 

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:36.050
 good 

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:39.639
 Let's see 

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:39.639
 display configuration 

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:46.950
 the truth I do not know how governments button 

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:50.150
 same body we have to love 

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:50.150
 they are the little arrows 

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:54.760
 being excellent 

00:05:58.689 --> 00:06:03.689
 in case they did not give me the buttons 

00:06:00.819 --> 00:06:07.880
 will be in the description of the video 

00:06:03.689 --> 00:06:11.080
 Many arrows are to move 

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:11.080
 enter pause 

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:20.850
 let's see 

00:06:23.569 --> 00:06:28.990
 I think it tends the des to put the 

00:06:26.629 --> 00:06:28.990
 bombs 

00:06:29.249 --> 00:06:31.999
 but how 

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:37.490
 good as this game was bomberman then 

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:39.800
 nothing else I think it's nothing else to move 

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:42.110
 move and put bombs but I think in 

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:45.010
 the other games the buttons are to that 

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:48.290
 idea and the arrows and the intro to 

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:50.240
 put pause and put good game that has 

00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:53.210
 been everything I hope you liked the 

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:54.770
 video tutorial rate the video I know 

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:57.400
 what 

00:06:54.770 --> 00:07:01.250
 the rule and why I rated the video 

00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:04.770
 with the buttons the kings but put 

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:08.660
 little hand watering where after 

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:08.660
