 any phone then it can happen that 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:25.680
 update the phone by changing Rome to 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.990
 phone is lost 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:31.050
 the address of me how can we do for 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:33.510
 restore our address instead 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.210
 as we have on the box 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.649
 our clues months are two sit repole 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.390
 your sim 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.879
 we only need five minutes of 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.040
 time our smartphone at hand e 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:47.550
 a couple of codes to carry the 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.620
 phone to normal functionality vi 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:54.340
 I only remember one thing you limit 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:56.890
 together they must not be changed in a manner 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:59.920
 in a different way that is putting in 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:02.170
 fictitious dissimilar because such from things 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:05.770
 and that of coach is illegal by now 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:09.040
 this video this video is only a 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:11.560
 illustrative purpose ie to be able to gp 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:13.660
 estimate our beginning instead that 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:16.270
 that we have with the box followed 

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:17.440
 the tutorial to understand how to do it 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:19.540
 Hello 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:22.650
 here we are on our smartphone and then 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:27.000
 take the handset and type 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:35.759
 star asterisk asterisk 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:39.550
 gate 3 6 4 6 6 3 3 gate 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:42.009
 star asterisk asterisk 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:47.160
 we will enter this way then we go 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:51.220
 on connectivity then 10 informations 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:54.729
 then we go to radio informations or in 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:58.360
 this case i'm iphone 2 because 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:02:01.000
 my dual sim good race if it's one 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:06.250
 acronym would have only future then in 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:08.709
 this case on the bottom to set the 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:11.530
 first e- mail address 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:20.730
 then we type in delete it in the meantime 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:23.590
 the more and we put back we put the most 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:27.450
 putting it back we will have this screen 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:37.300
 then I have for you or I infuse 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:42.670
 put it and gmr 1.7 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:45.970
 being photocall or then we click on le 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:48.880
 quotation marks is to position the cursor at 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:51.240
 center or in this case we can 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:55.560
 enter the address 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:59.880
 then I being the email address is 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:02.310

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:12.060
 my address will be my fictitious address 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:17.280
 this case I'll put 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:18.000
 11 12 13 14 and 15 that this address 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:25.110
 e-mail 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:31.610
 removed this one then 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:38.040
 9 10 13 14 and 15 15 digits then we finish 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:41.250
 tent looks like command and is written below 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:45.180
 that the command has been executed e 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:50.850
 let's end let's go back 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:54.420
 ue go back on the bottom or with 2 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:56.190
 same thing for those who have dual sim for whom 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:04:00.270
 has a sim used to support you in creating the 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:04.220
 Fondue phone and expect again 

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:08.190
 the more we put it back and this time 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:13.920
 we will put instead of putting a 1.7 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:18.680
 we will put a comma 10 c position of 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:21.680
 again with the center cursor here too 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:21.680
 we will 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:36.670
 ok sendo command as they performed 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:41.660
 let's go back backwards 

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:44.300
 back back back then i want 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:46.220
 let you see another thing before 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:49.190
 restart the phone 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:54.050
 then typing asterisk number sign 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:55.130
 06 the gate will tell us that I have one 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:57.920
 two 

00:04:55.130 --> 00:05:00.590
 will tell me what lines are not different to you there 

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:02.000
 I'll say maybe if you have one that doesn't 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:05.990
 of the pass 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:12.830
 ok then let's go back to turn off the 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:18.380
 phone turn off the phone ok e 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:21.040
 expect the phone has turned off not 

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:21.040
 relight 

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:51.060
 let's say it loads ok then nobody e 

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:53.640
 sim cards above emergency call 

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:55.970
 they are maximum inside 

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:59.280
 ok to show you that the address is 

00:05:55.970 --> 00:06:01.980
 changed in this case now color the 

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:03.840
 time in the possibility of putting a 

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:06.750
 example inside because here there are micro 

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:10.650
 sim riola on normal then we can 

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:14.760
 key in asterisk again 

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:19.400
 06 pound gate and will tell us that address 

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:22.290
 e mail and what i put before that 

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:25.800
 I have in this case the phone is back 

00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:28.170
 to work perfectly to receive 

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:31.190
 and make calls 

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:34.620
 I hope this guide was hostile 

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:36.000
 and more than someone who has been served 

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:38.220
 found with this problem 

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:41.850
 greetings to all youtube friends 

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:44.280
 follow the canal and every so often I will try 

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:46.940
 to put something interesting
