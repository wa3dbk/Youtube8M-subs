00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
sneak peek at its low lighting

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:15.950 
sneak peek at its low lighting
performance<00:00:14.370> with<00:00:14.790> its<00:00:14.940> 13<00:00:15.179> megapixel<00:00:15.929> camera

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
performance with its 13 megapixel camera

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.260 
performance with its 13 megapixel camera
they<00:00:16.770> kind<00:00:16.949> of<00:00:17.039> stress<00:00:17.279> the<00:00:17.430> fact<00:00:17.609> that<00:00:17.789> it<00:00:18.029> has

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
they kind of stress the fact that it has

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.290 
they kind of stress the fact that it has
superior<00:00:18.720> performance<00:00:19.320> against<00:00:20.010> other

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:20.300 
superior performance against other

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.179 
superior performance against other
comparable<00:00:21.300> cameras<00:00:21.840> out<00:00:22.050> there<00:00:22.350> so<00:00:22.740> here's<00:00:23.130> a

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
comparable cameras out there so here's a

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:24.920 
comparable cameras out there so here's a
demo<00:00:23.340> there's<00:00:23.850> a<00:00:23.910> there's<00:00:24.359> an<00:00:24.449> image<00:00:24.660> in<00:00:24.840> this

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
demo there's a there's an image in this

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.540 
demo there's a there's an image in this
box<00:00:25.230> there's<00:00:25.560> something<00:00:26.039> inside<00:00:26.250> this<00:00:26.340> box

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
box there's something inside this box

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.029 
box there's something inside this box
completely<00:00:27.000> dark<00:00:27.269> no<00:00:28.140> light<00:00:28.349> of<00:00:28.380> course<00:00:28.740> very

completely dark no light of course very
minimal<00:00:29.369> light<00:00:29.519> we're<00:00:29.730> gonna<00:00:29.849> put<00:00:30.060> the<00:00:30.150> camera

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
minimal light we're gonna put the camera

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.840 
minimal light we're gonna put the camera
right<00:00:30.660> here<00:00:30.869> in<00:00:31.019> front<00:00:31.369> against<00:00:32.369> it<00:00:32.489> and<00:00:32.640> then

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
right here in front against it and then

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:33.979

4 and even an iPhone iPhone 6 plus so

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.240 
4 and even an iPhone iPhone 6 plus so
here<00:00:41.430> we<00:00:41.489> go<00:00:41.610> so<00:00:41.850> I'm<00:00:41.969> gonna<00:00:42.090> run<00:00:42.270> the<00:00:42.329> camera

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:43.250 
here we go so I'm gonna run the camera

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:47.750 
here we go so I'm gonna run the camera
I'm<00:00:44.250> going<00:00:44.460> to<00:00:44.780> put<00:00:45.780> the<00:00:45.930> camera<00:00:46.579> the<00:00:47.579> lens

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
I'm going to put the camera the lens

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.189 
I'm going to put the camera the lens
over<00:00:48.620> the<00:00:49.620> unit<00:00:50.520> here<00:00:50.760> and<00:00:51.510> what<00:00:51.840> you<00:00:51.989> have<00:00:52.079> to

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
over the unit here and what you have to

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.200 
over the unit here and what you have to
do<00:00:52.350> is<00:00:52.559> there's<00:00:52.890> a<00:00:52.949> low<00:00:53.460> lighting<00:00:53.820> mode<00:00:53.969> here

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
do is there's a low lighting mode here

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:02.650 
do is there's a low lighting mode here
see<00:00:54.629> if<00:00:54.690> I<00:00:54.780> get<00:00:55.020> it<00:00:55.140> to<00:00:55.170> work

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:02.660 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.060 

so<00:01:03.660> here's<00:01:03.810> the<00:01:03.930> low<00:01:04.080> lighting<00:01:04.350> mode<00:01:04.650> you

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
so here's the low lighting mode you

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.130 
so here's the low lighting mode you
could<00:01:05.340> see<00:01:05.610> that<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.360> photo<00:01:06.630> is<00:01:06.720> right<00:01:06.930> there

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
could see that the photo is right there

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.240 
could see that the photo is right there
take<00:01:07.890> a<00:01:07.920> snapshot<00:01:09.290> and<00:01:10.290> there<00:01:10.470> you<00:01:10.560> go<00:01:10.710> let's

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
take a snapshot and there you go let's

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.100 
take a snapshot and there you go let's
take<00:01:11.460> a<00:01:11.490> look<00:01:11.730> at<00:01:11.820> that<00:01:11.910> shot<00:01:12.300> there's<00:01:13.050> a

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
take a look at that shot there's a

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.150 
take a look at that shot there's a
butterfly<00:01:13.620> in<00:01:13.830> there<00:01:14.040> and<00:01:15.000> there<00:01:15.180> it<00:01:15.270> is<00:01:16.160> it's

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:17.160 
butterfly in there and there it is it's

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:18.920 
butterfly in there and there it is it's

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
illuminated it's clear you can see some

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.690 
illuminated it's clear you can see some
of<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.050> colors<00:01:19.350> in<00:01:19.590> the<00:01:19.650> distinction<00:01:19.979> so

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
of the colors in the distinction so

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.130 
of the colors in the distinction so
that's<00:01:20.880> that<00:01:21.120> I'm<00:01:21.330> gonna<00:01:21.540> try<00:01:21.750> it<00:01:21.810> out<00:01:21.900> here

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
that's that I'm gonna try it out here

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.210 
that's that I'm gonna try it out here
now<00:01:22.410> with<00:01:22.680> an<00:01:22.800> iPhone<00:01:23.250> 6<00:01:23.790> plus<00:01:24.530> so<00:01:25.530> here's<00:01:25.979> the

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
now with an iPhone 6 plus so here's the

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.150 
now with an iPhone 6 plus so here's the
iPhone<00:01:26.580> 6<00:01:26.820> plus<00:01:27.020> I'm<00:01:28.020> going<00:01:28.200> to<00:01:28.290> try<00:01:28.470> and<00:01:28.770> even

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:29.160 
iPhone 6 plus I'm going to try and even

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.870 
iPhone 6 plus I'm going to try and even
use<00:01:29.310> HDR<00:01:30.030> here<00:01:30.360> so<00:01:30.690> try<00:01:30.750> and<00:01:31.170> get<00:01:31.290> the<00:01:31.530> best

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880 
use HDR here so try and get the best

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.950 
use HDR here so try and get the best
global<00:01:32.880> lighting<00:01:33.030> performance<00:01:35.630> now<00:01:36.630> you<00:01:36.750> saw

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
global lighting performance now you saw

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.370 
global lighting performance now you saw
it<00:01:37.110> a<00:01:37.140> little<00:01:37.530> bit<00:01:37.740> right<00:01:37.770> there<00:01:39.380> clearly

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
it a little bit right there clearly

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:46.670 
it a little bit right there clearly
close<00:01:40.770> it<00:01:44.810> we<00:01:45.810> need<00:01:45.960> to<00:01:46.140> try<00:01:46.350> and<00:01:46.470> raise<00:01:46.619> the

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
close it we need to try and raise the

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:52.130 
close it we need to try and raise the
exposure<00:01:49.399> and<00:01:50.399> you<00:01:50.729> could<00:01:50.880> just<00:01:51.000> barely<00:01:51.479> make

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
exposure and you could just barely make

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.930 
exposure and you could just barely make
it<00:01:52.170> out<00:01:52.560> noneya<00:01:53.009> sure<00:01:53.280> you<00:01:53.340> can<00:01:53.490> see<00:01:53.670> it<00:01:53.759> but

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:53.940 
it out noneya sure you can see it but

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:58.040 
it out noneya sure you can see it but
it's<00:01:54.450> very<00:01:54.570> faint<00:01:55.290> here<00:01:56.030> not<00:01:57.030> as<00:01:57.240> clear<00:01:57.690> like

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:58.050 
it's very faint here not as clear like

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:01.040 
it's very faint here not as clear like
the<00:01:58.610> zenfone<00:01:59.610> 2<00:01:59.880> and<00:02:00.240> last<00:02:00.570> phone<00:02:00.780> here<00:02:00.990> I'm
