send it back and she's been trained on

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.219 
send it back and she's been trained on
that<00:01:07.890> signal<00:01:08.130> or<00:01:08.970> a<00:01:09.030> whipped<00:01:09.420> up<00:01:09.630> on<00:01:09.840> her<00:01:09.990> body

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.280 
that signal or a whipped up on her body
to<00:01:10.860> bring<00:01:11.100> her<00:01:11.220> forward<00:01:11.840> once<00:01:12.840> she<00:01:13.110> knows

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
to bring her forward once she knows

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.109 
to bring her forward once she knows
these<00:01:13.590> signals<00:01:14.100> it's<00:01:14.340> simply<00:01:14.760> a<00:01:14.790> case<00:01:15.060> of

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
these signals it's simply a case of

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.080 
these signals it's simply a case of
correcting<00:01:15.900> any<00:01:16.140> mistakes<00:01:16.710> she<00:01:16.979> makes<00:01:17.250> so<00:01:17.909> if

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
correcting any mistakes she makes so if

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.450 
correcting any mistakes she makes so if
I<00:01:18.270> walk<00:01:18.510> away<00:01:18.720> from<00:01:18.900> her<00:01:19.350> and<00:01:19.560> she<00:01:19.650> follows<00:01:20.189> me

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
I walk away from her and she follows me

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.300 
I walk away from her and she follows me
back<00:01:21.090> I<00:01:21.840> can<00:01:22.590> step<00:01:22.830> her<00:01:22.979> back<00:01:23.310> onto<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:24.509> spot

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:25.310 
back I can step her back onto the spot

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.070 
back I can step her back onto the spot
if<00:01:26.310> she<00:01:26.520> walks<00:01:26.759> away<00:01:26.970> when<00:01:27.330> I<00:01:27.420> approach<00:01:27.810> her<00:01:28.020> I

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
if she walks away when I approach her I

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.410 
if she walks away when I approach her I
just<00:01:28.439> keep<00:01:28.619> walking<00:01:28.890> till<00:01:29.610> I<00:01:29.670> can<00:01:29.939> touch<00:01:30.180> her

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
just keep walking till I can touch her

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:31.609 
just keep walking till I can touch her
so<00:01:30.659> she<00:01:30.720> doesn't<00:01:31.049> use<00:01:31.350> negative

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
so she doesn't use negative

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.700 
so she doesn't use negative
reinforcement<00:01:31.860> to<00:01:32.670> get<00:01:32.880> rid<00:01:33.030> of<00:01:33.060> me<00:01:33.390> I<00:01:33.689> need<00:01:34.500> to
