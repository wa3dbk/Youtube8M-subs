00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:40.210 
mark right there from the bottom of the

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:43.920 
mark right there from the bottom of the
pot<00:05:40.389> that's<00:05:41.199> going<00:05:41.560> to<00:05:41.740> disappear<00:05:42.900> all<00:05:43.900> of

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:43.930 
pot that's going to disappear all of

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:48.570 
pot that's going to disappear all of
this<00:05:44.139> is<00:05:44.319> going<00:05:44.500> to<00:05:44.560> disappear<00:05:45.129> so<00:05:47.430> let's<00:05:48.430> do

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:48.580 
this is going to disappear so let's do

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:53.430 
this is going to disappear so let's do
one<00:05:48.819> more<00:05:51.089> the<00:05:52.089> whole<00:05:52.240> pot<00:05:52.569> is<00:05:52.599> off<00:05:52.990> the<00:05:53.199> fire

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:53.440 
one more the whole pot is off the fire

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:56.990 
one more the whole pot is off the fire
now

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:57.000 

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.939 

so<00:05:58.000> is<00:05:58.180> beginning<00:05:58.569> to<00:05:58.599> set<00:05:59.349> up<00:05:59.440> a<00:05:59.560> little<00:05:59.770> bit

00:05:59.939 --> 00:05:59.949 
so is beginning to set up a little bit

00:05:59.949 --> 00:06:01.950 
so is beginning to set up a little bit
but<00:06:00.099> there's<00:06:00.250> so<00:06:00.430> much<00:06:00.639> molten<00:06:01.089> wax<00:06:01.330> in<00:06:01.659> here

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:01.960 
but there's so much molten wax in here

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:10.290 
but there's so much molten wax in here
that<00:06:03.120> it's<00:06:04.120> not<00:06:04.270> going<00:06:04.719> to<00:06:07.740> set<00:06:08.740> up<00:06:09.300> that

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:10.300 
that it's not going to set up that

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:12.240 
that it's not going to set up that
quickly<00:06:10.839> where<00:06:10.960> I<00:06:10.990> can't<00:06:11.319> dip<00:06:11.560> this<00:06:11.770> brush<00:06:12.069> in

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:12.250 
quickly where I can't dip this brush in

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:16.439 
quickly where I can't dip this brush in
it<00:06:13.620> before<00:06:14.620> I<00:06:14.830> got<00:06:15.009> these<00:06:15.159> big<00:06:15.400> wide<00:06:15.699> brushes<00:06:16.330> I

00:06:16.439 --> 00:06:16.449 
it before I got these big wide brushes I

00:06:16.449 --> 00:06:18.119 
it before I got these big wide brushes I
was<00:06:16.599> using<00:06:16.900> the<00:06:16.990> one-inch<00:06:17.349> ones<00:06:17.589> to<00:06:17.740> go<00:06:17.889> over

00:06:18.119 --> 00:06:18.129 
was using the one-inch ones to go over

00:06:18.129 --> 00:06:25.090 
was using the one-inch ones to go over
it<00:06:18.250> and<00:06:18.310> that's<00:06:18.400> just<00:06:18.550> a<00:06:18.789> waste<00:06:18.969> of<00:06:19.150> time

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:25.100 

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:29.510 

so<00:06:26.100> we<00:06:26.280> got<00:06:26.460> three<00:06:27.560> you<00:06:28.560> get<00:06:28.650> the<00:06:28.710> idea

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:29.520 
so we got three you get the idea

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:33.939 
so we got three you get the idea
I<00:06:30.410> stick<00:06:31.410> the<00:06:31.590> brush<00:06:31.830> back<00:06:32.070> into<00:06:32.550> the<00:06:32.699> pot<00:06:32.930> and

00:06:33.939 --> 00:06:33.949 
I stick the brush back into the pot and

00:06:33.949 --> 00:06:39.140 
I stick the brush back into the pot and
there<00:06:34.949> was<00:06:35.160> already<00:06:36.410> some<00:06:37.410> wax<00:06:37.860> medium<00:06:38.669> that

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:39.150 
there was already some wax medium that

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:43.640 
there was already some wax medium that
was<00:06:39.740> in<00:06:40.740> the<00:06:41.430> pot<00:06:41.639> that<00:06:42.630> had<00:06:43.020> the<00:06:43.380> full

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:43.650 
was in the pot that had the full

00:06:49.249 --> 00:06:49.259 
complement of the the Marv Arnaz in it I

00:06:49.259 --> 00:06:53.629 
complement of the the Marv Arnaz in it I
didn't<00:06:50.039> put<00:06:50.340> any<00:06:51.350> linseed<00:06:52.350> oil<00:06:52.500> in<00:06:52.949> this

didn't put any linseed oil in this
mixture<00:06:54.120> I<00:06:54.449> usually<00:06:55.289> do<00:06:55.500> but<00:06:56.340> I<00:06:58.039> didn't<00:06:59.039> this

newspaper to get to soak it I prefer to

00:07:24.389 --> 00:07:26.150 
newspaper to get to soak it I prefer to
use<00:07:24.539> that<00:07:24.780> it<00:07:24.960> still<00:07:25.169> has<00:07:25.320> enough<00:07:25.349> oil<00:07:25.770> in<00:07:25.979> it

00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:26.160

and I like the colors I can get a more
varied<00:07:30.599> range<00:07:30.810> of<00:07:30.930> colors<00:07:31.289> because<00:07:33.020> the

00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:34.020 
varied range of colors because the

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:36.589 
varied range of colors because the
bright<00:07:34.560> colors<00:07:34.919> and<00:07:34.949> dry<00:07:35.310> pigments<00:07:35.820> are<00:07:36.270> very

00:07:36.589 --> 00:07:36.599 
bright colors and dry pigments are very

00:07:36.599 --> 00:07:38.870 
bright colors and dry pigments are very
expensive<00:07:36.900> and<00:07:37.320> to<00:07:38.070> tell<00:07:38.250> you<00:07:38.340> the<00:07:38.430> truth<00:07:38.639> I'm

00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:38.880 
expensive and to tell you the truth I'm

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:41.360 
expensive and to tell you the truth I'm
not<00:07:38.909> using<00:07:39.210> dry<00:07:39.449> pigments<00:07:39.930> much<00:07:40.830> these<00:07:41.070> days

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:41.370 
not using dry pigments much these days

00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:45.140 
not using dry pigments much these days
only<00:07:41.639> because<00:07:42.180> I<00:07:42.389> have<00:07:43.370> respiratory<00:07:44.370> issues

00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:45.150 
only because I have respiratory issues

00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:48.909 
only because I have respiratory issues
and<00:07:45.449> I<00:07:46.349> don't<00:07:46.380> want<00:07:46.860> to<00:07:47.099> deal<00:07:47.400> with<00:07:47.699> powders<00:07:48.449> in

00:07:48.909 --> 00:07:48.919 
and I don't want to deal with powders in

00:07:48.919 --> 00:07:54.740 
and I don't want to deal with powders in
the<00:07:49.919> air<00:07:51.470> that<00:07:52.470> I<00:07:52.530> can<00:07:52.830> breathe<00:07:53.599> that's<00:07:54.599> what

00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:54.750 
the air that I can breathe that's what

00:07:54.750 --> 00:07:56.300 
the air that I can breathe that's what
happens<00:07:55.080> when<00:07:55.199> you<00:07:55.260> get<00:07:55.380> older<00:07:55.800> you<00:07:55.919> start<00:07:55.949> to

happens when you get older you start to

00:07:56.310 --> 00:07:59.270 
happens when you get older you start to
worry<00:07:56.550> about<00:07:56.699> things<00:07:57.260> so<00:07:58.260> that's<00:07:58.409> enough<00:07:58.770> I'm
