00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:19.610
 we talked about it after the game in 

00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:21.560
 week 

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:24.260
 what we have stopped doing that the 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:26.840
 team at times have to be more 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:28.700
 ambitious more this one 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.680
 fight all the balls as if it were 

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:32.960
 the last and good we have a 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:35.230
 Saturday opportunity of doing 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.870
 good things 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:39.910
 framework very good for us with the 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:42.220
 superleader as it sums up a big team 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:45.309
 and well we think we can go to be a 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:47.500
 good match and go win over there 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:50.530
 face a great rival a great 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:53.180
 institution not for nothing is always in 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:56.900
 liguillas playing finals 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:58.880
 they have great players but good is 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:01.040
 the beauty of football that every season 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:03.500
 every week has a new rematch a 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:05.660
 new opportunity to break statistics 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:08.060
 to do things well and good we 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:09.670
 we go with the firm intention to win 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.200
 there 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:14.630
 good at the end 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.550
 all coaches are based on 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:19.940
 results 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:21.770
 we will try to defend it 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:24.500
 making a good football getting good 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:27.670
 results I think it's a great 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:30.490
 coach for me it would be a mistake to look 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:33.220
 move it 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:34.930
 and good we are going to leave with all the Saturday 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:36.909
 to get a good result with which 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:40.720
 we can do the good things end 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:43.060
 talk is worked and good are in 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:45.539
 of the court many times for more than 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:48.340
 practice and that makes the same mistake 

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:50.140
 we have received very infantile goals very 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:54.659
 fools throughout the season that 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:56.609
 they have cost us defeats and points but 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.319
 but good you have to continue working not 

00:01:56.609 --> 00:01:59.700
 we can fall or lower our arms 

00:01:58.319 --> 00:02:02.909
 there are still many days left 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.740
 ahead and good we will play the last 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:06.600
 all good games all 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.209
 matches as if they were the last good 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.709
 I think they are bound to beat him 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:14.010
 to the people they are the superlíder 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:15.960
 apparently we are the comfortable rival for 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:18.780
 them but 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:21.340
 but we've done well to visit, I think 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:25.030
 the team stops well 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:26.800
 on visiting fields and good always 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.330
 that you are visiting, you have a little more 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.670
 space to attack I think we can 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:34.260
 kick back well and bring us a good 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:38.290
 result does not motivate us much because 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:39.970
 you always saw a big team win 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:42.099
 you saw the superleader come 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:46.269
 playing pretty well doing things 

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:48.610
 very good and good to win him a 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:51.400
 important team gives us confidence 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:54.400
 gives motivation for what comes the rest 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:56.360
 of the tournament already several years ago 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:03:00.080
 blue cross game 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:02.060
 but now I have to be in town 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:04.430
 well, the results have not been 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:06.950
 given as we want but 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:10.100
 we keep working we have this 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:13.100
 week to correct errors for 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:14.780
 talk among us more than anything 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:17.540
 flip the page and now 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:20.240
 we have as you say blue cross that goes to 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:24.170
 be equal or more difficult than matches 

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:25.430
 previous we are going to visit and then 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:27.590
 we have to play first of all I 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:30.530
 I believe with order and then starting from 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:33.140
 there what rubén asks us 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:36.680
 It's complicated but we have equipment to 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:39.250
 to be able to do what I 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:43.129
 a difficult game also at the time 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:44.989
 training is no excuse not nothing 

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:47.630
 they are defending very well they had a goal 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:50.900
 they defended him and a death 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:53.750
 this but because one tries to give everything not 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:57.020
 there were opportunities not sumo 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:58.970
 and many spaces for the same 

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:02.060
 but then there we are or I am trying to 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:04.190
 always always give the maximum for 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:05.270
 me for all also and all of us 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:08.750
 we are playing the position also 

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:11.000
 we have to train excellent diary 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:12.530
 to be able to enjoy a game of 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.530
 owner I think we all have to 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:17.900
 think that give the best give the hundred 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:21.440
 cent because there is no sure place 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:24.790
 and we are going to deal with with blue cross to give 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:27.880
 a good match to get a good result 

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:30.130
 Let 's not be the party that comes 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:32.290
 first it's going to be against blue cross and now 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:33.820
 we will see in what if I believe that 

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:36.760
 how do you say everything you mentioned 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:39.640
 let's go against the first place we have 

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:41.470
 that motivate us to imagine that 

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:43.600
 make a good match excellent 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:45.010
 game play you for you we're going to 

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:48.100
 measure and let's know that also 

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:49.780
 we can there we depart imposed in 

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:50.730
 the week ourselves or in the 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:54.960
 training 

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:58.870
 speaking trying to support the companion 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:05:00.100
 inside the court this I think that of 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:03.190
 there 

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:05.020
 let's try to leave to us 

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:07.270
 we are also interested in the three points 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:10.150
 but we also want to play well not 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:13.780
 nice different nice bar to play 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:16.210
 well on all lines or everything 

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:19.000
 team I think they would like to make a 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:21.910
 perfect match where they do not have many 

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:25.060
 mistakes handles the ball have many 

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:27.250
 arrivals on the outside concrete forward and 

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:31.770
 win I think that that would be a match 

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:31.770
 perfect let's go in search of that
