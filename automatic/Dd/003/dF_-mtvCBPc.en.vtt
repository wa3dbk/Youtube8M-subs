00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 so we've already seen the case where you have 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.629
 four feet oriented 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:08.069
 in this line all at the moment this case 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:11.910
 now 1 to 1 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:13.950
 here in the front it 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.619
 to disorientate yesterday is the 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:19.949
 right is oriented right 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:22.800
 to prove the silver is oriented is 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.460
 oriented direct sale geologist white 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.410
 and yellow 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.410
 the time in the blue camera is oriented 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:31.260
 this bag underneath to guide all 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:34.290
 varieties up here such in italy 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.570
 and this is not guided by 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.149
 while these two here below 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.200
 video to fry white underneath 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:44.010
 oriented 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:47.190
 we only have two disorientated people 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:50.670
 time I moved ahead or behind I go 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:53.670
 disorientate guide is 4 feet here alone 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:56.399
 I have two 50 two in the same layer I 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.250
 I'll take them in Gorgo I'll break 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:01.320
 other two ne 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:03.270
 So when you have two, what do you do? 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.659
 leave sum here I already have one in 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:08.970
 forward is not what I do I'm gonna take it 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.130
 forward to orient this piece and 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.720
 disoriented the other three who are 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:17.759
 here in front 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:19.020
 It's such a high turn here ahead 18 between 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.330
 the other three 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.680
 okay and then I have to do I have 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.479
 than putting another piece that was 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.229
 oriented in place of that time of 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.560
 accept 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:30.270
 in this same case because the others face 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.060
 to these three now all geared to 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:35.100
 white on the side the green here on the side 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.560
 the blue here in front also in those three 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.640
 so disoriented that I bring another 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:43.530
 I'm disoriented too, I was four 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:48.259
 disoriented here and there I 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.259
 new here in front of new 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:55.690
 disoriented, right down 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.730
 It will be a long time to change this one. 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:59.440
 I could not do any work up either. 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:01.120
 also depends on where the other is 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:05.800
 This is not going to have to be learned there. 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:07.480
 so look I took her up to 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:10.390
 could place another that was 

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:12.940
 disoriented in the place and then I can 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:15.190
 Back I'm going to make another side of it 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:18.640
 then you can start looking at the next one. 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:20.440
 step is to put a white and blue 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.570
 white and green questions 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:26.410
 the two went back then so much to 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:29.890
 team and then ready has advised all and 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:33.900
 now just make put the two is the 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:37.930
 white and blue white and green 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:42.280
 Yesterday they are all oriented and you are 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:46.420
 with 1 blue and green again what 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:48.850
 happened to be okay here it's okay 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:52.510
 only you will not leave here because the 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:53.260
 another piece is here plays back in 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:59.170
 Cashier 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:03:02.170
 I do not know what to do. 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:06.690
 Luck is not good 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:09.480
 beauty people let's see now the whole case 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:10.989
 60 agents will see how many are 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.420
 oriented here 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:16.000
 the first begins in front otto in the 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:18.940
 front but upon white to the top 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.190
 The blue saw on the front is sure to 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:23.260
 wrong white side under the series 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:25.930
 human right here on the right is 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:28.360
 Back there, we 're already wrong, it 's white. 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:29.680
 I had to go up and it 's too. 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:32.680
 wrong with the way we are 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:35.350
 here behind is buried now 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:37.450
 is behind the top three and this is 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:41.019
 A green one is down. 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:43.660
 the security then the top three 

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:45.610
 behind the wrong one already has a right and the 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:49.860
 walls in teaching 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:53.110
 This is the hopscotch that 's up. 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:55.690
 down here this is rada and blue that 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:58.510
 it's down, it 's right 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:59.050
 the stoke has two then we have 36 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:02.710
 huh 

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:05.380
 back there are the top three here is this 

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:08.380
 of the front with these two here is good 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:11.620
 So when you have 6, what are you going to do? 

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:13.450
 will guide 3 when you guide them 3 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:15.370
 will automatically mess up human 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:17.769
 because every time you turn in the front 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:20.200
 or behind it is oriented four guiding 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:23.020
 three were going to unveil a 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:25.450
 as seriously as it has three 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:27.700
 oriented with what you disoriented 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:29.980
 now has four aces and guides the 

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:31.990
 other four that were missing then 

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:33.850
 example three top is so good that 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:37.360
 it takes the same layer to appear here 

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:39.910
 back already guides these three and only mess 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:41.980
 from the bottom it's right 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:43.570
 It's good, we'll do it, and then we'll just 

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:46.210
 you have to pay attention to where the 

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:48.160
 other time is this one here in the front 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:50.410
 This I can move on easy. 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:53.620
 spinning up and this can 

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:54.490
 front turning real easy here today walk 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:56.650
 here to there 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:58.930
 well you'll have to think what 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:59.710
 will happen to the other that will stay 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:02.050
 from behind 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:05.620
 the other news comes down here 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:08.890
 so I can both disoriented part 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:13.330
 here fucking bo her babe cleaning it here 

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:15.310
 or here I will do the following 1st 

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:18.640
 good thing to guide these three from above 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:21.070
 here and I'll make a good noise here 

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:23.800
 It was right, it came here and it went wrong. 

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:25.750
 now that's because I went back there 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:28.300
 here, because you will see that here already 

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:30.100
 I had a disorientation, right? 

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:33.370
 the other said I will not do it here 

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:36.010
 these two now and the other two 

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:37.690
 here's the bottom after doing 

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:39.730
 just this from here 

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:42.760
 and that one from here is already on that side that is 

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:45.760
 Just turn it twice and it comes right here. 

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:48.220
 I'm fine with four here. 

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:49.990
 none of them are green and white blue and 

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:53.470
 white but I'm seeing a couple here 

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:57.880
 I can try to clean it and leave it later. 

00:05:53.470 --> 00:06:00.120
 But I do not know how to get it out here. 

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:02.560
 Can be 

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:06.610
 It's a good way 

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:09.670
 so look 6 it's bad, you gotta have it 

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:12.400
 think only if you want to predict everything 

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:15.130
 this in the 15 seconds of expression right 

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:17.110
 but if people get used to it the worst part is 

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:19.540
 make this start the rest is the same 

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:22.240
 do you know the rest is not 

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:24.940
 continuing putting can put 

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:25.600
 Here the cross piece and then fit the 

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:28.030
 parents 

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:30.400
 As you already know, this is what has to 

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:32.290
 to train this first part of the 

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:34.960
 you're going to put everything in one layer 

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:37.110
 tempted once you have two and put a 

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:40.270
 of them a front or back layer 

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:44.500
 guide replaces the remaining one 

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:45.910
 and disorientates again this 16 is from 

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:48.400
 three in three 

00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:51.000
 we saw here okay okay I'll do 

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:51.000
 with 8 now
