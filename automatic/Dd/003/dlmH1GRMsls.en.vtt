totally lame you know you guys love it

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.170 
totally lame you know you guys love it
so<00:00:22.890> let's<00:00:23.070> just<00:00:23.189> get<00:00:23.310> right<00:00:23.369> into<00:00:23.730> it<00:00:23.910> with<00:00:24.119> the

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
so let's just get right into it with the

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.900 
so let's just get right into it with the
first<00:00:24.390> question<00:00:24.750> Stephen<00:00:25.350> C<00:00:25.560> asks<00:00:26.220> what<00:00:26.820> is

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
first question Stephen C asks what is

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.519 
first question Stephen C asks what is
the<00:00:27.060> difference<00:00:27.359> between<00:00:27.420> the<00:00:27.840> Hertz<00:00:28.140> rating

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
the difference between the Hertz rating

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.890 
the difference between the Hertz rating
and<00:00:28.680> response<00:00:29.220> time<00:00:29.519> in<00:00:29.760> milliseconds<00:00:30.179> of<00:00:30.689> a

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
and response time in milliseconds of a

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.209 
and response time in milliseconds of a
monitor<00:00:31.430> good<00:00:32.430> question<00:00:32.850> very<00:00:33.300> good<00:00:33.510> question

00:00:34.209 --> 00:00:34.219 
monitor good question very good question

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:37.010 
monitor good question very good question
hurts<00:00:35.219> typically<00:00:35.670> the<00:00:35.940> refresh<00:00:36.510> rate<00:00:36.630> which

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
hurts typically the refresh rate which

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.220 
hurts typically the refresh rate which
is<00:00:37.399> usually<00:00:38.399> a<00:00:38.430> signal<00:00:39.000> that<00:00:39.719> comes<00:00:39.870> from<00:00:40.140> the

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
is usually a signal that comes from the

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.110 
is usually a signal that comes from the
graphics<00:00:41.219> card<00:00:41.489> or<00:00:41.610> wherever<00:00:41.790> your<00:00:41.879> source

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
graphics card or wherever your source

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.930 
graphics card or wherever your source
goes<00:00:42.870> to<00:00:43.170> the<00:00:43.290> monitor<00:00:43.680> and<00:00:43.829> the<00:00:43.920> monitor<00:00:44.700> will

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
goes to the monitor and the monitor will

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.270 
goes to the monitor and the monitor will
basically<00:00:45.360> refresh<00:00:45.989> whatever<00:00:46.620> color<00:00:46.860> pixel

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
basically refresh whatever color pixel

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.750 
basically refresh whatever color pixel
at<00:00:48.239> a<00:00:48.300> certain<00:00:48.600> fixed<00:00:49.410> rate<00:00:49.829> now<00:00:50.520> we're<00:00:50.640> seeing

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
at a certain fixed rate now we're seeing

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.180 
at a certain fixed rate now we're seeing
variable<00:00:51.539> refresh<00:00:52.260> rates<00:00:52.500> come<00:00:52.829> out<00:00:52.949> stuff

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
variable refresh rates come out stuff

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.689 
variable refresh rates come out stuff
like<00:00:53.340> g-sync<00:00:53.730> or<00:00:54.000> adaptive<00:00:54.360> sync<00:00:54.620> but

00:00:55.689 --> 00:00:55.699 
like g-sync or adaptive sync but

00:00:55.699 --> 00:00:57.560 
like g-sync or adaptive sync but
traditionally<00:00:56.699> speaking<00:00:56.820> your<00:00:57.180> refresh<00:00:57.420> rate

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
traditionally speaking your refresh rate

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:58.880 
traditionally speaking your refresh rate
will<00:00:57.660> be<00:00:57.690> something<00:00:57.960> like<00:00:58.140> 60<00:00:58.500> Hertz<00:00:58.649> which

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
will be something like 60 Hertz which

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.880 
will be something like 60 Hertz which
means<00:00:59.250> that<00:00:59.370> 60<00:01:00.239> times<00:01:00.449> a<00:01:00.600> second<00:01:00.930> your

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
means that 60 times a second your

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.310 
means that 60 times a second your
monitor<00:01:02.309> or<00:01:02.340> refresh<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.149> image<00:01:03.359> and<00:01:03.539> if<00:01:04.199> a

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
monitor or refresh the image and if a

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.200 
monitor or refresh the image and if a
pixel<00:01:04.650> changes<00:01:05.280> like<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:05.700> color<00:01:05.850> supposed<00:01:06.150> to

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
pixel changes like the color supposed to

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.160 
pixel changes like the color supposed to
change<00:01:06.390> them<00:01:06.600> that's<00:01:06.750> when<00:01:06.900> that<00:01:06.990> will<00:01:07.140> happen

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
change them that's when that will happen

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.640 
change them that's when that will happen
so<00:01:07.920> it's<00:01:08.270> typically<00:01:09.270> within<00:01:09.990> a<00:01:10.140> second<00:01:10.500> right

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
so it's typically within a second right

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.070 
so it's typically within a second right
how<00:01:10.950> many<00:01:11.010> times<00:01:11.369> within<00:01:11.729> one<00:01:12.060> second<00:01:12.510> the

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
how many times within one second the

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.370 
how many times within one second the
display<00:01:14.070> can<00:01:14.340> actually<00:01:14.760> draw<00:01:15.570> data<00:01:15.840> that<00:01:16.229> is

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
display can actually draw data that is

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.620 
display can actually draw data that is
the<00:01:16.500> definition<00:01:16.650> of<00:01:17.009> hurts<00:01:17.220> yes<00:01:17.490> ok<00:01:18.030> and<00:01:18.270> then

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
the definition of hurts yes ok and then

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.270 
the definition of hurts yes ok and then
response<00:01:19.020> time<00:01:19.259> is<00:01:19.290> kind<00:01:19.890> of<00:01:19.979> a<00:01:20.070> little<00:01:20.159> bit

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
response time is kind of a little bit

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.830 
response time is kind of a little bit
different<00:01:20.700> it's<00:01:20.880> a<00:01:20.970> the<00:01:21.360> amount<00:01:21.509> of<00:01:21.570> time<00:01:21.810> that

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
different it's a the amount of time that

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.469 
different it's a the amount of time that
it<00:01:22.020> takes<00:01:22.229> any<00:01:22.590> given<00:01:23.310> pixel<00:01:23.490> on<00:01:23.790> a<00:01:23.820> display<00:01:24.060> to

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
it takes any given pixel on a display to

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.780 
it takes any given pixel on a display to
change<00:01:24.780> color<00:01:25.229> or<00:01:25.890> and<00:01:26.220> there<00:01:26.310> are<00:01:26.369> various

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
change color or and there are various

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.700 
change color or and there are various
methods<00:01:26.820> that<00:01:27.360> manufacturers<00:01:27.960> use<00:01:28.229> to

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
methods that manufacturers use to

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.530 
methods that manufacturers use to
calculate<00:01:28.920> that<00:01:29.159> some<00:01:29.640> use<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.150> great<00:01:30.360> a<00:01:30.390> grey

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
calculate that some use the great a grey

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.499 
calculate that some use the great a grey
method<00:01:30.950> others<00:01:31.950> use<00:01:32.189> the<00:01:32.460> active<00:01:33.360> to<00:01:33.479> inactive

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
method others use the active to inactive

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.660 
method others use the active to inactive
which<00:01:34.170> means<00:01:34.409> basically<00:01:34.619> going<00:01:35.009> from<00:01:35.130> fully

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
which means basically going from fully

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.580 
which means basically going from fully
white<00:01:35.939> to<00:01:36.210> fully<00:01:36.390> black<00:01:36.630> back<00:01:37.020> to<00:01:37.170> fully<00:01:37.350> white

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
white to fully black back to fully white

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.050 
white to fully black back to fully white
and<00:01:37.860> however<00:01:38.369> long<00:01:38.400> that<00:01:38.520> takes<00:01:38.670> is

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
and however long that takes is

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.819 
and however long that takes is
considered<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:40.200> response<00:01:40.530> time<00:01:40.710> in

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
considered the response time in

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.920 
considered the response time in
milliseconds<00:01:41.009> so<00:01:41.600> generally<00:01:42.600> you<00:01:42.630> want<00:01:42.810> a

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
milliseconds so generally you want a

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.960 
milliseconds so generally you want a
faster<00:01:43.229> response<00:01:43.350> time<00:01:43.799> if<00:01:44.460> you<00:01:44.579> have<00:01:44.700> a<00:01:44.729> slow

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
faster response time if you have a slow

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.249 
faster response time if you have a slow
response<00:01:45.299> time<00:01:45.509> you<00:01:45.600> type<00:01:45.720> typically<00:01:46.229> a

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
response time you type typically a

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.530 
response time you type typically a
ghosting<00:01:46.799> or<00:01:46.890> motion<00:01:47.399> blur<00:01:47.579> which<00:01:48.270> is<00:01:48.390> not

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
ghosting or motion blur which is not

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.780 
ghosting or motion blur which is not
very<00:01:48.570> good<00:01:48.840> on<00:01:48.960> the<00:01:49.049> eyes<00:01:49.170> so<00:01:49.619> you're<00:01:50.549> looking

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
very good on the eyes so you're looking

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.060 
very good on the eyes so you're looking
whereas<00:01:51.000> high<00:01:51.180> refresh<00:01:51.509> rate<00:01:51.780> is<00:01:51.990> more<00:01:52.290> more

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
whereas high refresh rate is more more

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.520 
whereas high refresh rate is more more
associated<00:01:53.460> with<00:01:53.670> like<00:01:53.850> fluidity<00:01:54.720> of<00:01:54.840> motion

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530
