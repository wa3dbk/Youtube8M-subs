00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:15.290 
hey welcome to another n wpg tutorial
today<00:00:13.410> we'll<00:00:13.710> be<00:00:13.950> talking<00:00:14.190> about<00:00:14.519> counters

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:15.300 
today we'll be talking about counters

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:18.290 
today we'll be talking about counters
now<00:00:16.110> our<00:00:16.290> counter<00:00:16.710> is<00:00:16.920> well<00:00:17.580> the<00:00:17.700> unit<00:00:18.090> that

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
now our counter is well the unit that

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.929 
now our counter is well the unit that
can<00:00:18.599> defeat<00:00:19.140> another<00:00:19.650> unit<00:00:20.099> the<00:00:20.279> best<00:00:20.310> and

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
can defeat another unit the best and

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.020 
can defeat another unit the best and
anyway<00:00:21.869> we'll<00:00:22.050> be<00:00:22.080> discussing<00:00:22.699> what<00:00:23.699> kills

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:24.030 
anyway we'll be discussing what kills

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:27.529 
anyway we'll be discussing what kills
what<00:00:24.240> faster<00:00:24.840> and<00:00:25.140> what<00:00:25.949> unit<00:00:26.520> to<00:00:26.730> use<00:00:26.910> when

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
what faster and what unit to use when

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.349 
what faster and what unit to use when
the<00:00:28.320> certain<00:00:28.680> you<00:00:29.190> know<00:00:29.310> opportunity<00:00:30.060> comes

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
the certain you know opportunity comes

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.990 
the certain you know opportunity comes
up<00:00:30.800> so<00:00:32.989> yeah<00:00:33.989> so<00:00:34.500> we'll<00:00:34.620> start<00:00:34.769> with<00:00:34.830> that

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:35.000 
up so yeah so we'll start with that

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.850 
up so yeah so we'll start with that

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
the way up to the champion isn't a very

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.770 
the way up to the champion isn't a very
good<00:01:36.840> unit<00:01:37.349> in<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:37.709> sense<00:01:37.979> that<00:01:38.099> it<00:01:38.780> can't

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
good unit in the sense that it can't

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.240 
good unit in the sense that it can't
really<00:01:39.840> kill<00:01:40.289> anything<00:01:40.530> and<00:01:40.890> it's<00:01:41.009> weak

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
really kill anything and it's weak

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.600 
really kill anything and it's weak
towards<00:01:41.580> almost<00:01:41.940> everything<00:01:43.160> but<00:01:44.160> it<00:01:44.310> is<00:01:44.429> an

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
towards almost everything but it is an

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.760 
towards almost everything but it is an
awesome<00:01:45.030> building<00:01:45.240> destroying<00:01:45.840> and<00:01:46.229> seeds

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
awesome building destroying and seeds

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.850 
awesome building destroying and seeds
destroy<00:01:47.599> that's<00:01:48.599> probably<00:01:49.050> it's<00:01:49.229> highlight

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
destroy that's probably it's highlight

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.979 
destroy that's probably it's highlight
once<00:01:50.190> you've<00:01:50.429> broken<00:01:50.610> into<00:01:51.090> a<00:01:51.119> town<00:01:51.450> just<00:01:51.810> go

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:51.989 
once you've broken into a town just go

00:01:51.989 --> 00:01:54.139 
once you've broken into a town just go
ahead<00:01:52.170> and<00:01:52.259> send<00:01:52.560> in<00:01:52.739> them<00:01:52.979> militia<00:01:53.580> because

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
ahead and send in them militia because

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.350 
ahead and send in them militia because
they<00:01:54.720> tear<00:01:55.200> up<00:01:55.380> anything

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
they tear up anything

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:05.210 
they tear up anything
and<00:01:58.130> yeah<00:02:01.730> then<00:02:02.730> we<00:02:03.000> focus<00:02:03.630> to<00:02:03.900> the<00:02:04.320> teutonic

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:05.220 
and yeah then we focus to the teutonic

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:07.220 
and yeah then we focus to the teutonic
night<00:02:05.400> now<00:02:05.580> this<00:02:05.760> one's<00:02:05.970> different<00:02:06.240> the

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:07.230 
night now this one's different the

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:09.320 
night now this one's different the
teutonic<00:02:07.800> night<00:02:07.980> can<00:02:08.400> kill<00:02:08.729> a<00:02:08.760> palliative

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
teutonic night can kill a palliative

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.120 
teutonic night can kill a palliative
it's<00:02:09.690> one<00:02:09.930> of<00:02:10.020> the<00:02:10.080> only<00:02:10.260> infantry<00:02:10.830> that<00:02:10.860> can

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.130 
it's one of the only infantry that can

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:14.870 
it's one of the only infantry that can
do<00:02:11.280> that<00:02:11.600> so<00:02:12.740> what<00:02:13.740> I<00:02:13.770> suggest<00:02:13.980> that<00:02:14.490> that<00:02:14.670> is<00:02:14.850> a

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
do that so what I suggest that that is a

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.940 
do that so what I suggest that that is a
bunch<00:02:15.180> of<00:02:15.270> archers<00:02:15.660> it's<00:02:15.900> a<00:02:15.990> slow<00:02:16.260> unit<00:02:16.710> so

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
bunch of archers it's a slow unit so

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.890 
bunch of archers it's a slow unit so
archers<00:02:17.460> and<00:02:17.670> monks<00:02:18.090> you<00:02:18.300> might<00:02:18.480> be<00:02:18.660> able<00:02:18.750> to

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
archers and monks you might be able to

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.960 
archers and monks you might be able to
convert<00:02:19.260> it<00:02:20.090> yeah<00:02:21.090> shall<00:02:21.450> I<00:02:21.810> go<00:02:22.020> against<00:02:22.440> a

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
convert it yeah shall I go against a

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:25.190 
convert it yeah shall I go against a
elephant<00:02:23.970> and<00:02:24.210> as<00:02:24.330> you<00:02:24.450> can<00:02:24.570> see<00:02:24.690> it<00:02:24.810> takes<00:02:25.050> it

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
elephant and as you can see it takes it

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.710 
elephant and as you can see it takes it
down<00:02:25.320> really<00:02:25.530> easy<00:02:25.830> and<00:02:26.760> barely<00:02:27.240> hurts<00:02:27.480> my

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
down really easy and barely hurts my

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.990 
down really easy and barely hurts my
goal<00:02:27.900> here<00:02:31.160> yeah<00:02:32.160> I'll<00:02:32.340> show<00:02:32.370> you<00:02:32.550> how<00:02:32.670> the
