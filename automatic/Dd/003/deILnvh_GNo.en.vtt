00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.109 
ah ok and I wouldn't do a first or
second<00:02:04.659> special<00:02:04.930> on<00:02:05.259> him<00:02:05.440> because<00:02:05.880> he<00:02:06.880> can

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:07.119 
second special on him because he can

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:09.300 
second special on him because he can
block<00:02:07.540> it<00:02:07.570> for<00:02:08.080> some<00:02:08.289> reason<00:02:08.319> so<00:02:08.890> I<00:02:08.950> save<00:02:09.280> up

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 
block it for some reason so I save up

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:12.150 
block it for some reason so I save up
for<00:02:09.640> my<00:02:09.729> third<00:02:10.179> now<00:02:10.720> she<00:02:10.840> stood<00:02:11.380> stunned<00:02:11.830> him

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
for my third now she stood stunned him

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.370 
for my third now she stood stunned him
so<00:02:12.400> i'll<00:02:12.520> get<00:02:12.640> to<00:02:12.819> hit<00:02:13.060> him<00:02:13.180> again<00:02:13.300> i<00:02:13.840> might<00:02:14.350> be

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380 
so i'll get to hit him again i might be

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:15.780 
so i'll get to hit him again i might be
able<00:02:14.560> to<00:02:14.680> hit<00:02:14.770> him<00:02:14.890> for<00:02:14.980> two<00:02:15.220> rounds<00:02:15.730> of

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
right let's take in my Hulk Hulk should

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:55.410 
right let's take in my Hulk Hulk should
be<00:02:48.730> able<00:02:48.819> to<00:02:49.000> do<00:02:49.180> this<00:02:49.330> not<00:02:49.600> a<00:02:49.630> problem<00:02:54.420> and

be able to do this not a problem and

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:59.059 
be able to do this not a problem and
then<00:02:56.319> we'll<00:02:56.500> look<00:02:56.709> at<00:02:57.040> the<00:02:57.459> rewards<00:02:58.269> and<00:02:58.660> the

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:02.019 
ISO 84 this has been actually very

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:05.190 
ISO 84 this has been actually very
generous<00:03:02.680> and<00:03:03.670> I've<00:03:04.299> been<00:03:04.420> able<00:03:04.540> to<00:03:04.840> rank<00:03:05.079> up

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
generous and I've been able to rank up

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:10.440 
generous and I've been able to rank up
my<00:03:05.380> Hawkeye<00:03:05.920> quite<00:03:06.280> a<00:03:06.310> bit<00:03:06.640> because<00:03:06.820> of<00:03:07.150> it<00:03:09.450> and

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
my Hawkeye quite a bit because of it and

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:13.979 
my Hawkeye quite a bit because of it and
like<00:03:10.660> I<00:03:10.750> said<00:03:10.810> tons<00:03:11.440> of<00:03:12.070> crystals<00:03:12.880> like<00:03:13.660> it

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:13.989 
like I said tons of crystals like it

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:16.110 
like I said tons of crystals like it
seems<00:03:14.290> like<00:03:14.440> at<00:03:14.560> least<00:03:14.709> ten<00:03:15.040> ah<00:03:15.400> look<00:03:16.000> at<00:03:16.060> that

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
seems like at least ten ah look at that

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.180 
seems like at least ten ah look at that
he<00:03:16.390> stuns<00:03:16.750> you<00:03:16.870> and<00:03:17.079> then<00:03:17.200> does<00:03:17.350> power<00:03:17.560> drain<00:03:17.980> I

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:18.190 
he stuns you and then does power drain I

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:19.800 
he stuns you and then does power drain I
think<00:03:18.549> that's<00:03:18.670> worse<00:03:18.940> than<00:03:18.970> doing<00:03:19.480> a<00:03:19.570> third

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810 
think that's worse than doing a third

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:22.650 
think that's worse than doing a third
special<00:03:20.290> actually<00:03:21.090> okay<00:03:22.090> let's<00:03:22.299> see<00:03:22.450> what<00:03:22.570> we

exploration rewards those are really
cool<00:03:35.910> yep<00:03:36.910> a<00:03:37.120> crystal<00:03:37.600> and<00:03:37.930> then<00:03:38.829> an<00:03:39.010> alpha

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.370 
cool yep a crystal and then an alpha

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:45.390 
cool yep a crystal and then an alpha
catalyst<00:03:40.530> 250<00:03:41.530> gold<00:03:41.829> shards<00:03:42.400> huge<00:03:43.739> very<00:03:44.739> cool

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:45.400 
catalyst 250 gold shards huge very cool

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:46.979 
catalyst 250 gold shards huge very cool
let's<00:03:45.670> take<00:03:45.850> a<00:03:45.880> look<00:03:46.150> at<00:03:46.269> this<00:03:46.450> because<00:03:46.780> this

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:46.989 
let's take a look at this because this

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:50.430 
let's take a look at this because this
is<00:03:47.200> actually<00:03:47.440> I<00:03:48.130> think<00:03:48.430> pretty<00:03:48.970> cool<00:03:49.329> all<00:03:49.630> tons

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:53.729 
is actually I think pretty cool all tons
of<00:03:50.829> rewards<00:03:51.519> and<00:03:51.760> like<00:03:52.329> all<00:03:52.630> of<00:03:53.079> these<00:03:53.230> this

00:03:53.729 --> 00:03:53.739 
of rewards and like all of these this
