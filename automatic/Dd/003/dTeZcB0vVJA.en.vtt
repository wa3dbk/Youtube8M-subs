thumb you want to do your repeater trick

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.550 
thumb you want to do your repeater trick
about<00:00:13.280> three<00:00:14.280> times<00:00:14.519> if<00:00:15.199> for<00:00:16.199> it<00:00:16.289> to<00:00:16.410> count

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
about three times if for it to count

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.019 
about three times if for it to count
that's<00:00:16.830> how<00:00:16.949> it<00:00:17.010> used<00:00:17.190> to<00:00:17.250> be<00:00:17.310> in<00:00:17.520> the<00:00:17.670> latter

into the beginning of that trick okay a
couple<00:01:15.060> pointers<00:01:15.570> that<00:01:15.780> will<00:01:15.900> help<00:01:16.020> you<00:01:16.170> be

quicker when you go into your 1.5 and
drop<00:01:21.780> you<00:01:22.470> want<00:01:22.740> to<00:01:23.040> make<00:01:23.640> sure<00:01:23.939> that<00:01:24.210> you

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
drop you want to make sure that you

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.960 
drop you want to make sure that you
wrapped<00:01:24.750> your<00:01:24.900> 1.5<00:01:25.530> towards<00:01:26.280> the<00:01:26.430> tip<00:01:26.670> of<00:01:26.850> your

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
wrapped your 1.5 towards the tip of your

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.249 
wrapped your 1.5 towards the tip of your
pointer<00:01:27.270> finger<00:01:27.509> that<00:01:27.659> gives<00:01:27.869> you<00:01:27.990> a<00:01:28.020> little

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
pointer finger that gives you a little

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.109 
pointer finger that gives you a little
bit<00:01:28.350> more<00:01:28.560> of<00:01:28.680> a<00:01:28.770> gap<00:01:29.040> back<00:01:29.310> here<00:01:29.700> that's

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
bit more of a gap back here that's

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:31.700 
bit more of a gap back here that's
easier<00:01:30.540> to<00:01:30.600> swing<00:01:30.930> back<00:01:31.110> out<00:01:31.350> into<00:01:31.560> your

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
easier to swing back out into your

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.300 
easier to swing back out into your
trapeze<00:01:32.220> and<00:01:33.060> then<00:01:33.650> also<00:01:34.650> when<00:01:34.979> you're<00:01:35.100> going

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
trapeze and then also when you're going

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.490 
trapeze and then also when you're going
from<00:01:35.460> your<00:01:35.579> trapeze<00:01:36.030> down<00:01:36.299> into<00:01:36.659> trapeze<00:01:37.409> and

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
from your trapeze down into trapeze and

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.800 
from your trapeze down into trapeze and
his<00:01:37.560> brother<00:01:37.650> I<00:01:38.100> wrap<00:01:38.850> it<00:01:39.030> down<00:01:39.270> around<00:01:39.479> my

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
his brother I wrap it down around my

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.069 
his brother I wrap it down around my
thumb<00:01:40.460> instead<00:01:41.460> of<00:01:41.610> back<00:01:41.820> off<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:42.720> trapeze

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
thumb instead of back off the trapeze

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.020 
thumb instead of back off the trapeze
and<00:01:43.110> then<00:01:43.290> back<00:01:43.500> around<00:01:43.890> my<00:01:44.189> pointer<00:01:44.549> finger<00:01:44.820> I

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
and then back around my pointer finger I

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.580 
and then back around my pointer finger I
just<00:01:45.479> wrap<00:01:45.659> it<00:01:45.689> straight<00:01:46.020> around<00:01:46.110> my<00:01:46.350> thumb

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
just wrap it straight around my thumb

00:01:46.590 --> 00:02:57.870 
just wrap it straight around my thumb
makes<00:01:47.430> for<00:01:47.610> an<00:01:47.729> easier<00:01:48.030> transition<00:01:48.299> for<00:01:48.899> me
