00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:44.810 
don't love triggering samples you never

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:47.200 
don't love triggering samples you never
feel<00:00:45.110> like<00:00:45.380> you're<00:00:45.560> really<00:00:45.770> involved<00:00:46.610> is<00:00:47.030> like

feel like you're really involved is like
you're<00:00:47.360> just<00:00:47.510> playing

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:48.170 
you're just playing

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:50.799 
you're just playing
you<00:00:48.290> must<00:00:48.440> be<00:00:48.590> pushing<00:00:48.829> play<00:00:49.670> on<00:00:49.910> a<00:00:49.940> tape

00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:50.809 
you must be pushing play on a tape

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:56.010 
you must be pushing play on a tape
recorder<00:00:51.320> or<00:00:51.350> a<00:00:51.559> keyboard<00:00:52.370> or<00:00:52.489> something

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:56.020 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:58.389 

yeah<00:00:57.020> the<00:00:57.170> nor<00:00:57.320> drum<00:00:57.620> -<00:00:57.860> because<00:00:58.070> this<00:00:58.219> is<00:00:58.370> a

00:00:58.389 --> 00:00:58.399 
yeah the nor drum - because this is a

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:02.530 
yeah the nor drum - because this is a
synthesizer<00:00:59.030> the<00:00:59.920> way<00:01:00.920> that<00:01:01.250> the<00:01:01.610> sounds<00:01:02.120> open

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:02.540 
synthesizer the way that the sounds open

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:04.840 
synthesizer the way that the sounds open
up<00:01:03.129> when<00:01:04.129> you're<00:01:04.250> playing<00:01:04.489> them<00:01:04.610> with<00:01:04.759> the

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:04.850 
up when you're playing them with the

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:07.810 
up when you're playing them with the
sticks<00:01:05.119> is<00:01:05.570> great<00:01:06.380> because<00:01:06.920> the<00:01:07.070> synth<00:01:07.310> you

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:07.820 
sticks is great because the synth you

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:21.999 
sticks is great because the synth you
know<00:01:07.969> is<00:01:08.420> a<00:01:08.479> lot<00:01:08.749> more<00:01:08.990> kind<00:01:09.829> of<00:01:09.979> fluid<00:01:21.009> after

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:22.009 
know is a lot more kind of fluid after

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:24.370 
know is a lot more kind of fluid after
10<00:01:22.279> seconds<00:01:22.850> I<00:01:23.029> was<00:01:23.450> flying<00:01:23.749> on<00:01:23.959> this<00:01:24.139> thing

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.380 
10 seconds I was flying on this thing

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.429 
10 seconds I was flying on this thing
that<00:01:24.619> it's<00:01:25.130> a<00:01:25.249> very<00:01:25.490> logical<00:01:25.759> layout<00:01:26.479> it's<00:01:27.200> not

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:27.439 
that it's a very logical layout it's not

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:30.730 
that it's a very logical layout it's not
a<00:01:27.469> kind<00:01:28.459> of<00:01:28.549> little<00:01:28.789> LCD<00:01:29.329> menu<00:01:29.929> thing<00:01:30.529> where

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:30.740 
a kind of little LCD menu thing where

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:31.870 
a kind of little LCD menu thing where
you<00:01:30.799> have<00:01:30.920> to<00:01:31.039> go<00:01:31.159> around<00:01:31.219> with<00:01:31.459> the<00:01:31.520> wheel<00:01:31.700> and

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880 
you have to go around with the wheel and

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:37.139 
you have to go around with the wheel and
press<00:01:32.060> Enter<00:01:32.299> and<00:01:32.329> going<00:01:32.630> to<00:01:32.719> another<00:01:32.810> level

00:01:37.139 --> 00:01:37.149 

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:39.819 

sometimes<00:01:38.149> it's<00:01:38.420> nice<00:01:38.569> to<00:01:38.630> have<00:01:38.810> a<00:01:38.990> patch

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:39.829 
sometimes it's nice to have a patch

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:42.910 
sometimes it's nice to have a patch
that's<00:01:39.859> kind<00:01:40.609> of<00:01:40.670> really<00:01:41.029> almost<00:01:41.840> lo-fi<00:01:42.560> and

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920 
that's kind of really almost lo-fi and

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:48.760 
that's kind of really almost lo-fi and
it's<00:01:43.369> capable<00:01:43.579> of<00:01:43.909> that<00:01:44.060> too

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:48.770 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:53.080 

I<00:01:50.229> like<00:01:51.229> sounds<00:01:51.770> that<00:01:51.920> don't<00:01:52.220> really<00:01:52.399> exist<00:01:52.490> in

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:53.090 
I like sounds that don't really exist in

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.649 
I like sounds that don't really exist in
nature<00:01:53.600> some<00:01:54.320> of<00:01:54.439> them<00:01:54.759> really<00:01:55.759> you<00:01:56.540> know

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:56.659 
nature some of them really you know

00:01:56.659 --> 00:01:59.020 
nature some of them really you know
electronic<00:01:57.350> and<00:01:58.100> obviously<00:01:58.580> kind<00:01:58.970> of

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.030 
electronic and obviously kind of

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:00.880 
electronic and obviously kind of
electronic<00:01:59.540> and<00:01:59.689> some<00:02:00.140> of<00:02:00.259> them<00:02:00.350> just<00:02:00.380> sound

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 
electronic and some of them just sound

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.609 
electronic and some of them just sound
like<00:02:01.009> a<00:02:01.460> cross<00:02:01.850> between<00:02:02.170> three<00:02:03.170> or<00:02:03.320> four

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:03.619 
like a cross between three or four

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:07.210 
like a cross between three or four
ethnic<00:02:04.159> instruments<00:02:05.049> and<00:02:06.049> it's<00:02:06.890> like<00:02:07.070> well

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:07.220 
ethnic instruments and it's like well

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:08.440 
ethnic instruments and it's like well
I've<00:02:07.310> never<00:02:07.460> heard<00:02:07.729> that<00:02:07.759> slow<00:02:08.209> you<00:02:08.330> know

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
I've never heard that slow you know

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.680 
I've never heard that slow you know

gamelan with a rimbor and a vibraphone

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:13.690 
gamelan with a rimbor and a vibraphone
and<00:02:12.140> something<00:02:12.800> else<00:02:12.950> in<00:02:13.190> there<00:02:13.370> but<00:02:13.400> it's

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
and something else in there but it's

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.550 
and something else in there but it's
it's<00:02:14.030> not<00:02:14.209> something<00:02:14.720> you<00:02:15.050> just<00:02:15.080> say<00:02:15.380> oh

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560

it's not something you just say oh
that's<00:02:16.010> a<00:02:16.220> viable<00:02:16.430> phone<00:02:25.450> myself<00:02:26.450> being<00:02:26.959> an

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
that's a viable phone myself being an

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.580 
that's a viable phone myself being an
acoustic<00:02:27.739> drum<00:02:28.010> player<00:02:29.470> dynamics<00:02:30.470> are

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
acoustic drum player dynamics are

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:33.039 
acoustic drum player dynamics are
everything<00:02:30.830> and<00:02:31.190> I<00:02:31.730> find<00:02:32.299> a<00:02:32.510> lot<00:02:32.810> of<00:02:32.930> the

00:02:33.039 --> 00:02:33.049 
everything and I find a lot of the

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:35.830 
everything and I find a lot of the
sounds<00:02:33.380> are<00:02:33.470> very<00:02:33.500> compatible<00:02:34.569> with<00:02:35.569> real

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
sounds are very compatible with real

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:43.539 
sounds are very compatible with real
drums<00:02:41.590> some<00:02:42.590> of<00:02:42.709> the<00:02:42.799> things<00:02:43.040> I<00:02:43.190> really<00:02:43.400> like

00:02:43.539 --> 00:02:43.549 
drums some of the things I really like

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:46.539 
drums some of the things I really like
are<00:02:43.730> the<00:02:43.819> white<00:02:44.120> noise<00:02:44.709> kind<00:02:45.709> of<00:02:45.830> in<00:02:46.100> the<00:02:46.310> same

00:02:46.539 --> 00:02:46.549 
are the white noise kind of in the same

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:49.420 
are the white noise kind of in the same
frequency<00:02:47.090> zone<00:02:47.569> as<00:02:47.810> the<00:02:47.840> hi-hat<00:02:48.319> but<00:02:48.590> they're

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
frequency zone as the hi-hat but they're

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.039 
frequency zone as the hi-hat but they're
not<00:02:49.549> competing<00:02:50.120> with<00:02:50.150> the<00:02:50.330> hi-hat<00:02:50.599> that<00:02:50.840> means

00:02:51.039 --> 00:02:51.049 
not competing with the hi-hat that means
