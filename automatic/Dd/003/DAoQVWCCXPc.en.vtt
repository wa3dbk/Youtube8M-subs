play and this will render it out so it

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:41.729 
play and this will render it out so it
actually<00:03:36.819> goes<00:03:37.470> it<00:03:38.470> tracks<00:03:38.859> the<00:03:40.620> what's<00:03:41.620> a

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:41.739 
actually goes it tracks the what's a

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:43.949 
actually goes it tracks the what's a
call<00:03:41.920> tracks<00:03:42.280> the<00:03:42.430> motion<00:03:42.730> as<00:03:42.959> motion

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:43.959 
call tracks the motion as motion

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:47.849 
call tracks the motion as motion
tracking<00:03:44.200> does<00:03:44.850> so<00:03:45.850> this<00:03:46.690> should<00:03:46.989> zoom<00:03:47.530> out<00:03:47.709> in

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:47.859 
tracking does so this should zoom out in

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:50.250 
tracking does so this should zoom out in
a<00:03:47.950> few<00:03:48.069> seconds<00:03:48.489> there<00:03:48.910> we<00:03:49.060> go<00:03:49.239> as<00:03:49.450> you<00:03:49.959> can<00:03:50.079> see

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:50.260 
a few seconds there we go as you can see

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.590 
a few seconds there we go as you can see
it's<00:03:50.380> tracking<00:03:50.950> the<00:03:51.579> motion<00:03:52.060> of<00:03:52.209> the<00:03:52.420> two

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:52.600 
it's tracking the motion of the two

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:57.720 
it's tracking the motion of the two
squares<00:03:52.930> and<00:03:54.269> once<00:03:55.269> it<00:03:55.690> finishes<00:03:56.440> which<00:03:57.430> it

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:57.730 
squares and once it finishes which it

00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:59.340 
squares and once it finishes which it
should<00:03:57.970> be<00:03:58.120> done<00:03:58.329> it's<00:03:58.780> like<00:03:58.900> halfway<00:03:59.139> done

00:03:59.340 --> 00:03:59.350 
should be done it's like halfway done

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:01.379 
should be done it's like halfway done
now<00:03:59.739> takes<00:04:00.489> a<00:04:00.609> while<00:04:00.790> because<00:04:01.000> it<00:04:01.150> has<00:04:01.239> to

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:01.389 
now takes a while because it has to

00:04:01.389 --> 00:04:03.780 
now takes a while because it has to
render<00:04:01.690> out<00:04:01.840> each<00:04:02.319> individual<00:04:03.130> frame<00:04:03.190> and

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:03.790 
render out each individual frame and

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:05.980 
render out each individual frame and
make<00:04:04.209> keyframes<00:04:04.720> for<00:04:04.870> each<00:04:05.079> of<00:04:05.230> them

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:05.990 
make keyframes for each of them

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:11.260 
make keyframes for each of them
you<00:04:07.330> got<00:04:08.330> two<00:04:08.810> more<00:04:09.050> in<00:04:09.680> movie<00:04:10.520> seconds<00:04:11.000> to<00:04:11.150> go

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:11.270 
you got two more in movie seconds to go

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:14.260 
you got two more in movie seconds to go
I<00:04:11.300> don't<00:04:11.480> know<00:04:11.570> how<00:04:11.720> that<00:04:11.750> translates<00:04:12.910> to<00:04:13.910> the

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:14.270 
I don't know how that translates to the

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:21.300 
I don't know how that translates to the
premiere<00:04:14.720> seconds<00:04:16.750> finish<00:04:17.750> finish<00:04:19.810> detective

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:29.000 
now you have a bunch of keyframes so if

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.480 
now you have a bunch of keyframes so if
you<00:04:29.570> can<00:04:29.720> see<00:04:29.960> right<00:04:29.990> here<00:04:30.530> when<00:04:31.040> I<00:04:31.070> press<00:04:31.460> play

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:31.490 
you can see right here when I press play

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:34.410 
you can see right here when I press play
there's<00:04:32.480> the<00:04:32.720> null<00:04:32.960> object<00:04:33.410> that<00:04:33.620> we<00:04:33.800> created

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:34.420 
there's the null object that we created

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:37.390 
there's the null object that we created
it<00:04:35.420> will<00:04:35.600> just<00:04:35.750> be<00:04:35.840> represented<00:04:36.500> as<00:04:36.650> a<00:04:36.680> square

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:37.400 
it will just be represented as a square

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:40.450 
it will just be represented as a square
and<00:04:38.530> when<00:04:39.530> you<00:04:39.650> zoom<00:04:39.800> out<00:04:39.950> it<00:04:40.130> stays<00:04:40.430> in

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:40.460 
and when you zoom out it stays in

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:42.910 
and when you zoom out it stays in
practically<00:04:41.180> the<00:04:41.390> same<00:04:41.600> place<00:04:41.870> so<00:04:42.530> what

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:42.920 
practically the same place so what

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:44.380 
practically the same place so what
you're<00:04:43.040> going<00:04:43.130> to<00:04:43.190> need<00:04:43.370> to<00:04:43.490> do<00:04:43.610> now<00:04:43.790> is<00:04:44.000> go

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:44.390 
you're going to need to do now is go

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:48.400 
you're going to need to do now is go
over<00:04:44.570> to<00:04:45.140> your<00:04:46.630> creeper<00:04:47.630> or<00:04:47.990> whatever

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:52.250 
character animation press parent and

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:55.840 
character animation press parent and
parent<00:04:53.060> it<00:04:53.180> to<00:04:53.330> the<00:04:53.480> null<00:04:53.780> one<00:04:54.350> null<00:04:55.340> object

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:55.850 
parent it to the null one null object

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:58.420 
parent it to the null one null object
one<00:04:56.090> so<00:04:56.660> when<00:04:56.810> you<00:04:56.900> play<00:04:57.110> it<00:04:57.230> now<00:04:57.410> it<00:04:57.830> will<00:04:58.130> zoom

00:04:58.420 --> 00:04:58.430 
one so when you play it now it will zoom

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:03.010 
one so when you play it now it will zoom
out<00:04:59.120> as<00:04:59.390> well<00:04:59.810> as<00:05:00.050> scale<00:05:00.950> down<00:05:01.190> so<00:05:02.180> you<00:05:02.810> can

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:03.020 
out as well as scale down so you can

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:05.560 
out as well as scale down so you can
fine-tune<00:05:03.620> this<00:05:04.040> why<00:05:04.190> going<00:05:04.610> in<00:05:04.760> and<00:05:04.940> editing

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:05.570 
fine-tune this why going in and editing

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:09.640 
fine-tune this why going in and editing
the<00:05:05.600> keyframes<00:05:06.760> that<00:05:07.760> it<00:05:07.970> has<00:05:08.150> but<00:05:09.020> I<00:05:09.230> this<00:05:09.530> is

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:09.650 
the keyframes that it has but I this is

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:10.990 
the keyframes that it has but I this is
just<00:05:09.830> a<00:05:09.950> quick<00:05:10.070> little<00:05:10.310> test<00:05:10.640> to<00:05:10.730> show<00:05:10.940> you

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:11.000 
just a quick little test to show you

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.970 
just a quick little test to show you
guys<00:05:11.240> the<00:05:11.720> motion<00:05:12.080> tracking<00:05:12.260> abilities<00:05:12.800> you

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:12.980 
guys the motion tracking abilities you

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:16.050 
guys the motion tracking abilities you
can<00:05:13.010> fine-tune<00:05:13.640> it<00:05:13.910> as<00:05:14.030> I<00:05:14.180> said<00:05:14.390> as<00:05:14.600> to<00:05:15.230> train

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:16.060 
can fine-tune it as I said as to train

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:19.710 
can fine-tune it as I said as to train
not<00:05:17.060> train<00:05:17.390> at<00:05:17.660> like<00:05:17.990> track<00:05:18.710> point<00:05:18.950> one

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:19.720 
not train at like track point one

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:22.960 
not train at like track point one
tracker<00:05:20.720> one<00:05:20.990> I<00:05:21.230> think<00:05:22.010> it<00:05:22.100> is<00:05:22.130> yeah<00:05:22.550> if<00:05:22.730> you<00:05:22.880> go

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:22.970 
tracker one I think it is yeah if you go

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:25.540 
tracker one I think it is yeah if you go
to<00:05:23.030> tracker<00:05:23.360> one<00:05:23.660> and<00:05:23.920> click<00:05:24.920> on<00:05:25.100> this<00:05:25.280> and

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:25.550 
to tracker one and click on this and

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:29.650 
to tracker one and click on this and
then<00:05:26.090> you<00:05:26.210> can<00:05:26.360> start<00:05:26.920> editing<00:05:27.920> all<00:05:28.700> of<00:05:29.480> your

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:29.660 
then you can start editing all of your

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:31.060 
then you can start editing all of your
key<00:05:29.870> points<00:05:30.260> so<00:05:30.350> you<00:05:30.410> can<00:05:30.560> move<00:05:30.650> each<00:05:30.860> key

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:31.070 
key points so you can move each key

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:33.220 
key points so you can move each key
point<00:05:31.340> out<00:05:31.520> move<00:05:31.940> it<00:05:32.120> so<00:05:32.330> it<00:05:32.450> doesn't<00:05:32.480> glitch

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:33.230 
point out move it so it doesn't glitch

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:36.130 
point out move it so it doesn't glitch
as<00:05:33.380> much<00:05:33.560> but<00:05:34.180> do<00:05:35.180> it<00:05:35.330> to<00:05:35.420> your<00:05:35.510> liking<00:05:35.630> and<00:05:35.990> it

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:36.140 
as much but do it to your liking and it

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:39.130
