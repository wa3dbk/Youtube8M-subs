00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:37.360 
solution into your case about 3/4 of the

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:45.889 
solution into your case about 3/4 of the
way<00:01:37.539> full<00:01:37.570> or<00:01:38.909> 10<00:01:39.909> ounces<00:01:40.360> about<00:01:41.320> 10<00:01:41.830> ounces

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:51.779 

now<00:01:46.899> put<00:01:47.470> your<00:01:47.940> copper<00:01:49.289> cork<00:01:50.289> and<00:01:50.580> iron<00:01:51.580> rod

00:01:51.779 --> 00:01:51.789 
now put your copper cork and iron rod

00:01:51.789 --> 00:02:05.969 
now put your copper cork and iron rod
into<00:01:52.179> the<00:01:53.159> case<00:01:55.740> tightly<00:02:00.960> now<00:02:02.520> let's<00:02:04.649> take<00:02:05.649> the

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:05.979 
into the case tightly now let's take the

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:12.120 
into the case tightly now let's take the
red<00:02:06.790> wire<00:02:07.709> positive<00:02:08.709> and<00:02:09.399> attach<00:02:09.759> it<00:02:10.440> to<00:02:11.440> the

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
red wire positive and attach it to the

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:19.430 
red wire positive and attach it to the
copper<00:02:12.579> sheet<00:02:14.579> then<00:02:15.750> take<00:02:16.769> your<00:02:17.820> black<00:02:18.820> wire

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
copper sheet then take your black wire

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:31.870 
copper sheet then take your black wire
ground<00:02:20.440> attach<00:02:21.400> it<00:02:21.579> to<00:02:22.890> the<00:02:24.209> iron<00:02:25.209> rod

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:31.880 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:39.250 

then<00:02:32.890> attach<00:02:33.890> the<00:02:33.920> red<00:02:34.460> wire<00:02:34.700> positive<00:02:35.980> to<00:02:38.260> the

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
then attach the red wire positive to the

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:46.420 
then attach the red wire positive to the
red<00:02:39.530> and<00:02:42.310> attach<00:02:43.310> the<00:02:44.060> black<00:02:44.270> wire<00:02:44.600> ground<00:02:45.430> or

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
red and attach the black wire ground or

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:56.040 
red and attach the black wire ground or
negative<00:02:46.850> to<00:02:47.890> the<00:02:48.890> black<00:02:49.130> and<00:02:49.510> it<00:02:50.510> reads<00:02:53.470> 0.49

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:56.050 
negative to the black and it reads 0.49

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:00.790 
negative to the black and it reads 0.49
millivolts<00:02:57.050> and<00:02:58.150> that's<00:02:59.150> how<00:02:59.390> you<00:02:59.530> build<00:03:00.530> a

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:00.800 
millivolts and that's how you build a

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:03.970 
millivolts and that's how you build a
Baghdad<00:03:01.550> battery
