fast and consistent and smart well as
you<00:00:22.350> can<00:00:22.439> see<00:00:22.500> kind<00:00:22.890> of<00:00:23.010> here<00:00:23.250> we<00:00:23.400> have<00:00:23.550> a<00:00:24.210> bit

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
you can see kind of here we have a bit

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.589 
you can see kind of here we have a bit
of<00:00:25.019> a<00:00:25.140> newer<00:00:25.320> section<00:00:25.769> here<00:00:25.890> Impala<00:00:26.189> it<00:00:26.460> was

00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:26.599 
of a newer section here Impala it was

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:28.820 
of a newer section here Impala it was
whoops<00:00:27.599> last<00:00:27.930> year<00:00:28.170> but<00:00:28.320> they're<00:00:28.650> a<00:00:28.680> bit

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
whoops last year but they're a bit

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.529 
whoops last year but they're a bit
smaller<00:00:29.189> so<00:00:29.279> this<00:00:29.580> year<00:00:29.789> you<00:00:29.820> know<00:00:30.240> how<00:00:30.300> to<00:00:30.359> do

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
smaller so this year you know how to do

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.120 
smaller so this year you know how to do
a<00:00:30.570> little<00:00:31.019> bit<00:00:31.199> of<00:00:31.320> a<00:00:31.410> rhythm<00:00:31.619> through<00:00:31.920> it<00:00:32.040> at

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
a little bit of a rhythm through it at

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.260 
a little bit of a rhythm through it at
least<00:00:32.279> that's<00:00:32.489> what<00:00:32.579> it's<00:00:32.700> looking<00:00:32.969> like<00:00:33.000> to

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
least that's what it's looking like to

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.360 
least that's what it's looking like to
me<00:00:33.420> right<00:00:33.719> now<00:00:33.899> and<00:00:34.170> uh<00:00:34.230> you<00:00:34.980> know<00:00:35.070> through

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
me right now and uh you know through

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:36.709 
me right now and uh you know through
something<00:00:35.730> a<00:00:35.820> section<00:00:36.149> like<00:00:36.300> this<00:00:36.420> you<00:00:36.630> would

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
something a section like this you would

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.240 
something a section like this you would
definitely<00:00:37.079> want<00:00:37.230> to<00:00:37.320> squeeze<00:00:37.980> the<00:00:38.100> bike

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
definitely want to squeeze the bike

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.770 
definitely want to squeeze the bike
that's<00:00:38.489> key<00:00:38.730> through<00:00:39.000> any<00:00:39.180> type<00:00:39.450> of<00:00:39.480> loops

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
that's key through any type of loops

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.810 
that's key through any type of loops
rhythm<00:00:40.500> section<00:00:40.980> it<00:00:41.129> doesn't<00:00:41.399> matter<00:00:41.520> what<00:00:41.730> it

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
rhythm section it doesn't matter what it

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:42.950 
rhythm section it doesn't matter what it
is<00:00:41.879> you<00:00:42.030> want<00:00:42.180> to<00:00:42.210> be<00:00:42.300> squeezing<00:00:42.600> that<00:00:42.780> bike

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
is you want to be squeezing that bike

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.619 
is you want to be squeezing that bike
and<00:00:43.520> looking<00:00:44.520> at<00:00:44.640> from<00:00:45.000> here<00:00:45.059> you<00:00:45.480> know<00:00:45.570> you

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
and looking at from here you know you

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.119 
and looking at from here you know you
kind<00:00:45.870> of<00:00:45.899> jump<00:00:46.110> into<00:00:46.320> them<00:00:46.590> you<00:00:46.739> could<00:00:46.890> kind<00:00:47.070> of

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
kind of jump into them you could kind of

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:48.860 
kind of jump into them you could kind of
get<00:00:47.219> your<00:00:47.340> front<00:00:47.640> wheel<00:00:47.820> keep<00:00:48.480> on<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:48.719> back

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
get your front wheel keep on the back

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.479 
get your front wheel keep on the back
and<00:00:49.110> kind<00:00:49.260> of<00:00:49.320> hit<00:00:49.739> your<00:00:49.829> front<00:00:50.070> wheel<00:00:50.190> on<00:00:50.219> each

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
and kind of hit your front wheel on each

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.250 
and kind of hit your front wheel on each
one<00:00:50.730> and<00:00:50.940> kind<00:00:51.149> of<00:00:51.210> just<00:00:51.390> skim<00:00:51.899> through<00:00:52.110> them

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
one and kind of just skim through them

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.619 
one and kind of just skim through them
or<00:00:52.770> you<00:00:52.949> another<00:00:53.219> option<00:00:53.489> is<00:00:53.789> to<00:00:53.820> kind<00:00:54.120> of<00:00:54.180> get

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
or you another option is to kind of get

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.389 
or you another option is to kind of get
a<00:00:54.690> nice<00:00:54.899> smart<00:00:55.289> rhythm<00:00:55.649> through<00:00:55.860> them<00:00:55.980> double

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
a nice smart rhythm through them double

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.420 
a nice smart rhythm through them double
triple<00:00:56.879> double<00:00:57.780> and<00:00:58.020> you<00:00:58.440> know<00:00:58.739> body<00:00:58.980> position

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
triple double and you know body position

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:00.950 
triple double and you know body position
is<00:00:59.489> definitely<00:00:59.670> keying<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.180> loops<00:01:00.390> I<00:01:00.570> I<00:01:00.600> think

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
is definitely keying the loops I I think

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.930 
is definitely keying the loops I I think
I<00:01:01.350> said<00:01:01.559> it<00:01:01.649> rider<00:01:01.890> anyways<00:01:02.370> I<00:01:02.520> know<00:01:02.579> I<00:01:02.699> get<00:01:02.910> a

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
I said it rider anyways I know I get a

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.100 
I said it rider anyways I know I get a
little<00:01:03.090> sketchy<00:01:03.359> every<00:01:03.660> once<00:01:03.870> in<00:01:03.960> a<00:01:04.049> while

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
little sketchy every once in a while

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.440 
little sketchy every once in a while
hanging<00:01:04.650> off<00:01:04.830> but<00:01:05.040> uh<00:01:05.070> you<00:01:05.729> know<00:01:05.850> squeezing

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
hanging off but uh you know squeezing

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.210 
hanging off but uh you know squeezing
the<00:01:06.510> bike<00:01:06.659> number<00:01:07.049> one<00:01:07.200> thing<00:01:07.439> and<00:01:07.650> then<00:01:08.040> you

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
the bike number one thing and then you

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.070 
the bike number one thing and then you
know<00:01:08.250> holding<00:01:08.760> on<00:01:08.909> you<00:01:09.360> use<00:01:09.689> your<00:01:09.840> clutch

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
know holding on you use your clutch

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.570 
know holding on you use your clutch
through<00:01:10.320> these<00:01:10.500> definitely<00:01:11.010> you<00:01:11.159> can't<00:01:11.340> just

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
through these definitely you can't just

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.010 
through these definitely you can't just
kind<00:01:11.760> of<00:01:11.880> walk<00:01:12.330> it<00:01:12.479> through<00:01:12.510> it<00:01:12.780> it<00:01:12.840> won't<00:01:12.930> work

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
kind of walk it through it it won't work

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.810 
kind of walk it through it it won't work
good<00:01:13.350> so<00:01:13.560> you<00:01:13.619> gotta<00:01:13.830> kind<00:01:14.130> of<00:01:14.159> do<00:01:14.610> a<00:01:14.640> little

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
good so you gotta kind of do a little

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.760 
good so you gotta kind of do a little
bit<00:01:14.939> of<00:01:14.970> clutch<00:01:15.240> stir<00:01:15.450> here<00:01:15.689> and<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:16.619> main

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
bit of clutch stir here and the main

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:17.060 
bit of clutch stir here and the main
thing

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
thing

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.550 
thing
just<00:01:17.340> squeeze<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:17.850> bike<00:01:18.060> and<00:01:18.300> keep<00:01:19.229> the<00:01:19.380> power

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
just squeeze the bike and keep the power

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.770 
just squeeze the bike and keep the power
all<00:01:20.430> right<00:01:20.640> well<00:01:20.760> as<00:01:20.880> you<00:01:21.000> can<00:01:21.120> see<00:01:21.390> we're<00:01:21.630> here

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
at the next section we finished up the

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.460 
at the next section we finished up the
whoops<00:01:24.060> and<00:01:24.360> now<00:01:24.479> we're<00:01:24.720> coming<00:01:25.140> into<00:01:25.350> the

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.530 
whoops and now we're coming into the

you land off that and you kind of jump

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.219 
you land off that and you kind of jump
into<00:01:29.970> the<00:01:30.150> face<00:01:30.330> of<00:01:30.360> this<00:01:30.600> a<00:01:30.630> little<00:01:30.840> bit<00:01:31.020> of<00:01:31.140> a

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
into the face of this a little bit of a

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.290 
into the face of this a little bit of a
fence<00:01:31.440> single<00:01:31.830> and<00:01:32.460> you're<00:01:32.580> standing<00:01:33.030> up<00:01:33.180> you

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:33.300 
fence single and you're standing up you

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:34.609 
fence single and you're standing up you
don't<00:01:33.360> want<00:01:33.450> to<00:01:33.600> be<00:01:33.660> sitting<00:01:33.990> down<00:01:34.050> in<00:01:34.380> case

thing you come out of the corner here
like<00:02:03.330> I<00:02:03.420> said<00:02:03.630> on<00:02:03.720> the<00:02:03.810> last<00:02:03.960> double<00:02:04.440> actually

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:05.190 
like I said on the last double actually

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:06.380 
like I said on the last double actually
on<00:02:05.310> these<00:02:05.490> you<00:02:05.700> can<00:02:05.820> actually<00:02:05.940> hit<00:02:06.240> these

on these you can actually hit these

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:07.490 
on these you can actually hit these
sitting<00:02:06.720> down<00:02:06.869> and<00:02:07.050> get<00:02:07.140> a<00:02:07.170> little<00:02:07.410> more

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
corner after that and it's pretty much

corner after that and it's pretty much
these<00:02:33.959> are<00:02:34.019> actually<00:02:34.410> really<00:02:34.560> easy<00:02:34.680> doubles

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
these are actually really easy doubles

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.759 
these are actually really easy doubles
they're<00:02:35.370> huge<00:02:35.700> but<00:02:36.030> they're<00:02:36.959> really<00:02:37.200> easy<00:02:37.410> cuz

00:02:37.759 --> 00:02:37.769

you<00:02:37.890> know<00:02:38.010> you<00:02:38.100> kind<00:02:38.370> of<00:02:38.400> get<00:02:38.579> that<00:02:38.610> nice<00:02:38.940> flow

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:39.239 
you know you kind of get that nice flow

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:42.470 
you know you kind of get that nice flow
boro<00:02:39.720> boro<00:02:40.680> we've<00:02:41.340> done<00:02:41.549> the<00:02:41.670> whoops<00:02:41.850> we've

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
boro boro we've done the whoops we've

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:43.970 
boro boro we've done the whoops we've
done<00:02:42.690> the<00:02:42.810> doubles<00:02:43.200> and<00:02:43.530> we've<00:02:43.650> done<00:02:43.769> these

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
done the doubles and we've done these

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.740 
done the doubles and we've done these
big<00:02:44.190> doubles<00:02:44.610> and<00:02:44.820> the<00:02:44.940> main<00:02:45.090> thing<00:02:45.329> I<00:02:45.510> think

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
big doubles and the main thing I think

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.680 
big doubles and the main thing I think
most<00:02:46.380> of<00:02:46.560> all<00:02:46.709> on<00:02:47.040> all<00:02:47.190> these<00:02:47.370> is<00:02:47.640> uh<00:02:47.690> squeezing

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
most of all on all these is uh squeezing

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.300 
most of all on all these is uh squeezing
the<00:02:48.750> legs<00:02:48.930> and<00:02:49.170> being<00:02:49.590> steady<00:02:49.860> on<00:02:50.010> the<00:02:50.100> power

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
the legs and being steady on the power

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.030 
the legs and being steady on the power
that's<00:02:50.489> the<00:02:50.670> main<00:02:50.850> thing
