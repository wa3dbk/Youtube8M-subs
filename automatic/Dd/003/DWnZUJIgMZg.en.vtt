00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:13.799
 welcome and welcome to steps 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.929
 creative today continuing with the 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:19.270
 special from wsi tape I'll teach you to 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:21.880
 make another kind of wsi tape 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:25.780
 to make these tapes what we're going 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:27.520
 to use is rice paper this paper 

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:30.400
 of rice is a Japanese paper that what 

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:32.590
 they sell in stationeries in bookstores and 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:35.410
 even I buy this in the 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:38.020
 supermarket come in different colors 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:40.629
 they come ready and they also come with 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:42.640
 designs with designs guys and designs 

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:45.390
 big 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:48.790
 you have to remember that the tapes was it 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:52.660
 they are originally made with a paper 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:55.120
 Japanese high quality but today in the 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:56.920
 market there are many types of paper is 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:59.530
 that's why he taught them to do different 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:02.589
 styles which there are several that 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:05.480
 resemble the original guasita in 

00:01:02.589 --> 00:01:06.920
 synthesis are decorated ribbons 

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:11.420
 what we are going to use 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:14.060
 it is for this case double contact tape 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:18.140
 of the thickness they want come in many 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:21.619
 many thicknesses and for this simply 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:23.869
 you have to paste the tape now there are some 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:26.180
 that you notice which is which is the 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:27.640
 reverse what is the right and there are others 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:30.229
 who are equal 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:34.189
 normally where you have a little bit more 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:35.960
 of fluff is the reverse side and the 

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:38.960
 part more list is the part of the right 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:40.909
 but it will depend on the brand 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.369
 then of the part that has more 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:46.869
 pelito which is like the wrong side you 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:46.869
 let's apply the tape 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.799
 this tape we are going to stretch it 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.719
 well so that the paper does not crumple and 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:57.240
 it's important once we 

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:59.530
 We did this by passing it over 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.610
 spatula or 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.610
 some card 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:09.340
 this is going to make the tape adhere 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:13.260
 well and that in the future do not leave 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.260
 once we did this 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:22.590
 just cut out all the surplus 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:22.590
 of paper and leave only the strip 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:29.220
 once we have the cut 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:31.940
 this simply 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.940
 It is peeled 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:38.920
 and can be applied where we want 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:42.189
 we have the option to leave it 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:45.010
 how is it with the design as it comes 

00:02:42.189 --> 00:02:47.079
 for example, those that are here are 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:50.290
 all with the original design that came 

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:53.170
 put in different sizes 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:56.109
 of the double contact tape but also 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:58.389
 we have the option to give you a 

00:02:56.109 --> 00:03:00.579
 more personalized touch or if some are 

00:02:58.389 --> 00:03:03.299
 very smooth and we want to enhance also 

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:03.299
 we can do it 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:09.160
 to do the enhancement we can 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:11.370
 make some freehand drawing or 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:14.940
 we can help with some template 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.940
 with some extension 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:21.390
 and to work on this type of paper 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:24.650
 Here, I recommend working with 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:26.620
 permanent markers 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:29.049
 what are these that are used to 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:33.290
 drawings are also available in 

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:35.360
 bookstores and litter bins and markers 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:37.970
 markers we use to color 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:40.760
 they have to be indelible markers that 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:43.099
 they are not soluble in water and neither do we 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:45.140
 ink inks for scrap 

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:47.590
 because it is in the water either because it 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:50.080
 Opens the ink too much 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:52.480
 the pen so that it serves us for 

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:55.239
 do the drawing to do the design of 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:57.800
 what we want to transfer to 

00:03:55.239 --> 00:04:01.010
 tape 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:03.650
 once we have already checked if 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:05.600
 you see it seems apenitas then 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:08.390
 there we can fill in 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:12.050
 colors but it's important to fill 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:14.840
 with colors that barely touch because if 

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:17.450
 not the ink is going to open too much and it's going 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:20.019
 to smear a lot of the work then 

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:24.000
 they barely touch it 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:24.000
 and this is already marked 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:31.710
 now later if you want to give 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:31.710
 an even greater enhancement to it 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:38.870
 with a permanent marker black color does 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:42.990
 they make all the flange also just 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:45.420
 touching the work 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:48.120
 in this way is marked and you 

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:50.820
 they can make the designs they want 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:54.240
 be with templates or just do 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:55.700
 Drawings with your hands the way you 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:58.220
 want 

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:59.800
