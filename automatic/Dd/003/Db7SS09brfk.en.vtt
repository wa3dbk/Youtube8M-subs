these guys to tap his all new giant and

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:27.360 
these guys to tap his all new giant and
then<00:06:26.139> he<00:06:26.229> alright<00:06:26.590> so<00:06:26.740> this<00:06:26.889> is<00:06:27.039> this<00:06:27.220> was

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:27.370 
then he alright so this is this was

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:28.710 
then he alright so this is this was
definitely<00:06:27.490> the<00:06:27.700> right<00:06:27.760> row<00:06:28.270> right<00:06:28.479> play<00:06:28.690> I

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:28.720 
definitely the right row right play I

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:31.710 
definitely the right row right play I
think<00:06:28.960> because<00:06:29.800> now<00:06:29.950> he's<00:06:30.310> gonna<00:06:30.630> he's<00:06:31.630> gonna

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:31.720 
think because now he's gonna he's gonna

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:34.020 
think because now he's gonna he's gonna
only<00:06:31.930> be<00:06:31.990> able<00:06:32.139> to<00:06:32.260> block<00:06:32.560> one<00:06:33.039> of<00:06:33.130> the<00:06:33.190> twos<00:06:33.460> so

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:34.030 
only be able to block one of the twos so

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:36.950 
only be able to block one of the twos so
he's<00:06:34.150> going<00:06:34.240> still<00:06:34.570> going<00:06:34.599> to<00:06:34.810> take<00:06:35.020> 15<00:06:35.860> damage

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:36.960 
he's going still going to take 15 damage

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:40.200 
he's going still going to take 15 damage
which<00:06:37.960> basically<00:06:38.349> assures<00:06:38.860> me<00:06:38.950> to<00:06:39.400> two

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:40.210 
which basically assures me to two

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:41.999 
which basically assures me to two
the<00:06:40.300> game<00:06:40.449> pretty<00:06:40.720> much<00:06:40.810> next<00:06:41.229> turn<00:06:41.410> unless<00:06:41.889> he
