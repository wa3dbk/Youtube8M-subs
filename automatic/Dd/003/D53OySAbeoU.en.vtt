new squeeze box technology called
squeeze<00:01:47.700> box<00:01:47.970> low<00:01:48.360> there's<00:01:48.869> going<00:01:48.990> to<00:01:49.049> be<00:01:49.110> a

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
squeeze box low there's going to be a

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.859 
squeeze box low there's going to be a
consistent<00:01:49.500> flex<00:01:49.950> in<00:01:50.189> between<00:01:50.549> your<00:01:50.670> feet<00:01:50.939> and

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
consistent flex in between your feet and

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.410 
consistent flex in between your feet and
a<00:01:52.049> little<00:01:52.290> bit<00:01:52.380> stiffer<00:01:52.740> of<00:01:53.040> a<00:01:53.310> of<00:01:53.670> a<00:01:53.850> flex<00:01:54.180> on

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
a little bit stiffer of a of a flex on

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.420 
a little bit stiffer of a of a flex on
the<00:01:54.720> outside<00:01:55.259> of<00:01:55.590> your<00:01:55.680> bindings<00:01:56.219> on<00:01:56.399> a

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
the outside of your bindings on a

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.190 
the outside of your bindings on a
lateral<00:01:56.759> side<00:01:57.210> because<00:01:57.600> the<00:01:57.750> core<00:01:57.990> is

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
lateral side because the core is

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.170 
lateral side because the core is
actually<00:01:58.770> just<00:01:58.890> a<00:01:59.040> little<00:01:59.070> bit<00:01:59.369> thicker<00:01:59.549> for

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
actually just a little bit thicker for

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.630 
actually just a little bit thicker for
more<00:02:00.450> pop<00:02:00.780> now<00:02:01.409> even<00:02:02.009> though<00:02:02.100> the<00:02:02.250> board<00:02:02.490> is

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
more pop now even though the board is

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.069 
more pop now even though the board is
nice<00:02:02.850> and<00:02:03.060> thin<00:02:03.240> because<00:02:03.390> of<00:02:03.600> the<00:02:03.659> off-axis

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
nice and thin because of the off-axis

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.649 
nice and thin because of the off-axis
phileo<00:02:04.979> flex<00:02:05.369> meaning<00:02:05.850> that<00:02:06.000> the<00:02:06.119> whole<00:02:06.299> board

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
phileo flex meaning that the whole board

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.419 
phileo flex meaning that the whole board
is<00:02:06.780> kind<00:02:06.960> of<00:02:07.020> milled<00:02:07.380> down<00:02:07.500> to<00:02:07.890> be<00:02:07.979> really

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
is kind of milled down to be really

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.550 
is kind of milled down to be really
really<00:02:08.640> thin<00:02:08.910> and<00:02:09.060> it's<00:02:09.450> actually<00:02:09.840> so<00:02:10.170> thin

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
really thin and it's actually so thin

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.800 
really thin and it's actually so thin
that<00:02:10.770> Burton<00:02:11.550> had<00:02:11.700> to<00:02:11.819> put<00:02:12.000> pads<00:02:12.300> on<00:02:12.540> here

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
that Burton had to put pads on here

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:13.330 
that Burton had to put pads on here
because<00:02:13.110> of<00:02:13.200> the

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
because of the

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.070 
because of the
channel<00:02:13.670> system<00:02:13.940> is<00:02:14.120> actually<00:02:14.540> a<00:02:14.720> little<00:02:14.930> bit

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
channel system is actually a little bit

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.800 
channel system is actually a little bit
taller<00:02:15.739> a<00:02:15.980> little<00:02:16.370> bit<00:02:16.459> thicker<00:02:16.700> than<00:02:17.000> after<00:02:17.780> a

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
taller a little bit thicker than after a

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:20.140 
taller a little bit thicker than after a
wood<00:02:18.080> courts<00:02:18.530> kind<00:02:18.739> of<00:02:18.830> cool<00:02:18.980> now<00:02:19.640> that<00:02:19.879> core

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
wood courts kind of cool now that core

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:21.970 
wood courts kind of cool now that core
has<00:02:20.269> been<00:02:20.300> wrapped<00:02:20.720> in<00:02:20.989> a<00:02:21.170> Triax<00:02:21.800> fiberglass

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
has been wrapped in a Triax fiberglass

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.190 
has been wrapped in a Triax fiberglass
so<00:02:22.610> this<00:02:22.760> thing<00:02:22.910> is<00:02:23.030> gonna<00:02:23.209> have<00:02:23.420> a<00:02:23.450> lot<00:02:23.840> of<00:02:23.870> pop

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
so this thing is gonna have a lot of pop

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.170 
so this thing is gonna have a lot of pop
to<00:02:24.500> it<00:02:24.530> even<00:02:24.800> though<00:02:25.040> it<00:02:25.370> does<00:02:25.610> have<00:02:25.790> a<00:02:25.819> soft

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
to it even though it does have a soft

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:29.199 
to it even though it does have a soft
flex<00:02:26.569> rating<00:02:26.810> now<00:02:27.550> the<00:02:28.550> base<00:02:28.700> is<00:02:28.970> a<00:02:29.000> sintered

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:29.209 
flex rating now the base is a sintered

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:31.270 
flex rating now the base is a sintered
base<00:02:29.390> it's<00:02:29.780> going<00:02:29.959> to<00:02:30.049> absorb<00:02:30.140> lots<00:02:30.680> of<00:02:30.830> Wax<00:02:31.040> so

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
base it's going to absorb lots of Wax so

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:32.710 
base it's going to absorb lots of Wax so
make<00:02:31.430> sure<00:02:31.459> you<00:02:31.640> keep<00:02:31.790> it<00:02:31.910> maintained<00:02:32.450> and

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
make sure you keep it maintained and

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:37.170 
make sure you keep it maintained and
then<00:02:33.170> there's<00:02:33.769> gonna<00:02:33.920> be<00:02:34.129> off<00:02:34.580> access

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
then there's gonna be off access

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.640 
then there's gonna be off access
frostbite<00:02:38.180> edges<00:02:38.360> to<00:02:38.780> it<00:02:38.900> so<00:02:39.049> that<00:02:39.290> means<00:02:39.470> that

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
frostbite edges to it so that means that

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:41.470 
frostbite edges to it so that means that
there's<00:02:39.890> little<00:02:40.160> protruding<00:02:40.700> edges<00:02:40.819> in<00:02:41.239> the

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
there's little protruding edges in the

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.780 
there's little protruding edges in the
heel<00:02:41.750> area<00:02:41.959> and<00:02:42.319> on<00:02:42.530> the<00:02:42.620> toe<00:02:42.830> area<00:02:43.010> a<00:02:43.370> kind<00:02:43.730> of

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
heel area and on the toe area a kind of

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:46.059 
heel area and on the toe area a kind of
a<00:02:43.910> line<00:02:44.150> at<00:02:44.450> a<00:02:44.599> 15<00:02:45.049> degree<00:02:45.170> in<00:02:45.500> a<00:02:45.560> negative<00:02:45.920> 15

00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:46.069 
a line at a 15 degree in a negative 15

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:48.309 
a line at a 15 degree in a negative 15
degree<00:02:46.549> on<00:02:46.730> your<00:02:47.150> back<00:02:47.329> foot<00:02:47.660> this<00:02:48.110> is<00:02:48.170> an

00:02:48.309 --> 00:02:48.319 
degree on your back foot this is an

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:49.479 
degree on your back foot this is an
awesome<00:02:48.530> board<00:02:48.890> there's<00:02:49.160> a<00:02:49.220> lot<00:02:49.370> of

00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:49.489 
awesome board there's a lot of

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:52.330 
awesome board there's a lot of
Technology<00:02:50.030> a<00:02:50.060> lots<00:02:50.450> of<00:02:50.569> off-axis<00:02:51.470> stuff<00:02:52.040> to
