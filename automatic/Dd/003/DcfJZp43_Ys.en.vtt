at about 58 psi you could have gone with
a<00:02:10.500> 60<00:02:10.890> psi<00:02:11.280> gauge<00:02:11.489> but<00:02:11.790> I<00:02:11.849> decided<00:02:12.060> to<00:02:12.209> go<00:02:12.300> with

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
a 60 psi gauge but I decided to go with

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.500 
a 60 psi gauge but I decided to go with
the<00:02:12.569> hundred

in<00:02:13.660> case<00:02:14.050> I'm<00:02:14.230> over<00:02:14.500> pressuring<00:02:14.920> just<00:02:15.310> I'll

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
in case I'm over pressuring just I'll

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.040 
in case I'm over pressuring just I'll
have<00:02:15.490> a<00:02:15.550> better<00:02:15.640> range<00:02:15.940> to<00:02:16.150> see<00:02:16.330> so<00:02:16.930> we're

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
have a better range to see so we're

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:18.240 
have a better range to see so we're
gonna<00:02:17.140> go<00:02:17.260> ahead<00:02:17.350> and<00:02:17.470> install<00:02:17.709> this<00:02:18.010> today

it's super quick and right away we can

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:21.330 
it's super quick and right away we can
fire<00:02:20.319> it<00:02:20.440> up<00:02:20.530> and<00:02:20.709> see<00:02:20.800> if<00:02:20.890> we're<00:02:20.980> getting<00:02:21.040> fuel

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
fire it up and see if we're getting fuel

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:22.530 
fire it up and see if we're getting fuel

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
problems all right guys so we're under

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:28.710 
problems all right guys so we're under
hood<00:02:25.810> we've<00:02:26.620> got<00:02:26.890> our<00:02:27.180> Jegs<00:02:28.180> fuel<00:02:28.480> pressure

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.380 
hood we've got our Jegs fuel pressure
gauge<00:02:28.840> to<00:02:29.020> be<00:02:29.290> installed<00:02:29.680> we've<00:02:30.520> also<00:02:30.700> got<00:02:31.000> the

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
gauge to be installed we've also got the

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:35.160 
gauge to be installed we've also got the
-<00:02:32.110> six<00:02:32.440> -<00:02:32.620> -<00:02:32.800> six<00:02:33.130> am<00:02:33.459> fitting<00:02:33.730> and<00:02:34.360> because

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
- six - - six am fitting and because

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:36.900 
- six - - six am fitting and because
there<00:02:35.380> is<00:02:35.410> a<00:02:35.530> pipe<00:02:35.770> thread<00:02:36.070> on<00:02:36.220> there<00:02:36.400> it's

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910 
there is a pipe thread on there it's

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:38.610 
there is a pipe thread on there it's
also<00:02:37.090> a<00:02:37.240> good<00:02:37.390> idea<00:02:37.450> to<00:02:37.660> steel<00:02:37.990> pipe<00:02:38.260> threads

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
also a good idea to steel pipe threads

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:41.910 
also a good idea to steel pipe threads
and<00:02:38.890> so<00:02:39.010> I'm<00:02:39.130> using<00:02:39.480> some<00:02:40.480> high<00:02:40.959> temp<00:02:41.260> thread

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
and so I'm using some high temp thread

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.170 
and so I'm using some high temp thread
sealant<00:02:42.190> hopefully<00:02:42.640> you<00:02:42.700> guys<00:02:42.790> can<00:02:42.850> see<00:02:43.000> that

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
sealant hopefully you guys can see that

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.710 
sealant hopefully you guys can see that
there

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720

do<00:02:44.050> not<00:02:44.230> use<00:02:44.470> teflon<00:02:44.890> tape<00:02:45.069> it's<00:02:45.670> a<00:02:45.820> bad<00:02:46.000> idea

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
do not use teflon tape it's a bad idea

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:47.790 
do not use teflon tape it's a bad idea
first<00:02:46.930> thing<00:02:47.080> we<00:02:47.200> got<00:02:47.320> to<00:02:47.350> do<00:02:47.500> is<00:02:47.620> pretty

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:47.800 
first thing we got to do is pretty

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.170 
first thing we got to do is pretty
straightforward<00:02:48.070> pull<00:02:48.640> this<00:02:48.730> engine<00:02:49.000> cover

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
straightforward pull this engine cover

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.150 
straightforward pull this engine cover
off<00:02:49.360> so<00:02:49.540> we<00:02:49.630> can<00:02:49.780> get<00:02:49.870> to<00:02:49.930> the<00:02:50.080> fuel<00:02:50.290> rail<00:02:50.350> I've

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160 
off so we can get to the fuel rail I've

00:02:51.160 --> 00:03:00.770 
off so we can get to the fuel rail I've
got<00:02:51.340> my<00:02:51.430> wrench<00:02:51.640> right<00:02:51.820> here

run recently there should be no pressure
in<00:05:21.340> this<00:05:21.460> line<00:05:21.640> or<00:05:21.880> minimal<00:05:22.270> pressure<00:05:22.480> in<00:05:22.750> this

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:22.900

so<00:05:35.550> a<00:05:51.720> little<00:05:52.720> bit<00:05:52.960> of<00:05:53.020> drip<00:05:53.230> but<00:05:53.410> not<00:05:53.530> bad

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:54.570 
so a little bit of drip but not bad

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:56.820 
so a little bit of drip but not bad
and<00:05:55.570> there<00:05:55.810> we<00:05:55.900> have<00:05:55.930> there's<00:05:56.350> our<00:05:56.470> exposed

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:56.830 
and there we have there's our exposed

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:59.660 
and there we have there's our exposed
end<00:05:57.070> there<00:05:57.940> is<00:05:58.180> our<00:05:58.390> male<00:05:58.720> and<00:05:58.960> off<00:05:59.140> the<00:05:59.350> rail

00:05:59.660 --> 00:05:59.670 
end there is our male and off the rail

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:02.160 
end there is our male and off the rail
so<00:06:00.670> we've<00:06:00.850> got<00:06:01.000> our<00:06:01.120> gauge<00:06:01.390> now<00:06:01.840> it's<00:06:01.990> gonna<00:06:02.110> be

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:02.170 
so we've got our gauge now it's gonna be

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:05.520 
so we've got our gauge now it's gonna be
pointing<00:06:02.650> this<00:06:03.370> way<00:06:03.810> so<00:06:04.810> it<00:06:04.900> can<00:06:05.020> be<00:06:05.110> read<00:06:05.320> with

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:05.530 
pointing this way so it can be read with

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:07.590 
pointing this way so it can be read with
the<00:06:05.620> engine<00:06:05.830> cover<00:06:06.040> off<00:06:06.250> put<00:06:07.240> the<00:06:07.330> male<00:06:07.480> the

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:07.600 
the engine cover off put the male the

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:09.090 
the engine cover off put the male the
female<00:06:07.720> ends<00:06:08.200> go<00:06:08.350> ahead<00:06:08.530> and<00:06:08.650> screw<00:06:08.830> this<00:06:08.950> in

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:09.100 
female ends go ahead and screw this in

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:17.490 
female ends go ahead and screw this in
place<00:06:10.770> tighten<00:06:11.770> it<00:06:11.950> up<00:06:14.370> and<00:06:16.050> then<00:06:17.050> tighten<00:06:17.260> up

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:17.500 
place tighten it up and then tighten up

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:38.689 
place tighten it up and then tighten up
the<00:06:17.800> supply<00:06:18.640> on<00:06:18.790> the<00:06:18.820> rail

00:06:38.689 --> 00:06:38.699 

00:06:38.699 --> 00:06:43.499 

nice<00:06:39.699> and<00:06:39.909> tight<00:06:40.500> all<00:06:41.500> the<00:06:41.560> way<00:06:41.889> around<00:06:42.509> this

00:06:43.499 --> 00:06:43.509 
nice and tight all the way around this

00:06:43.509 --> 00:06:44.909 
nice and tight all the way around this
fitting<00:06:43.870> was<00:06:43.960> never<00:06:44.139> loosened<00:06:44.470> up<00:06:44.620> it's<00:06:44.800> still

00:06:44.909 --> 00:06:44.919 
fitting was never loosened up it's still

00:06:44.919 --> 00:06:46.640 
fitting was never loosened up it's still
securely<00:06:45.400> on<00:06:45.610> the<00:06:45.729> end<00:06:45.879> of<00:06:46.000> the

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:49.469 
securely on the end of the
push-to-connect<00:06:47.650> so<00:06:48.340> before<00:06:49.150> we<00:06:49.240> put<00:06:49.389> the

00:06:49.469 --> 00:06:49.479 
push-to-connect so before we put the

00:06:49.479 --> 00:06:50.580 
push-to-connect so before we put the
engine<00:06:49.599> cover<00:06:49.870> and<00:06:49.990> everything<00:06:50.050> back<00:06:50.409> on

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:50.590 
engine cover and everything back on

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:51.990 
engine cover and everything back on
let's<00:06:50.860> go<00:06:51.009> ahead<00:06:51.129> and<00:06:51.400> crank<00:06:51.580> it<00:06:51.699> up<00:06:51.759> and<00:06:51.879> make

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:52.000 
let's go ahead and crank it up and make

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:58.469 
let's go ahead and crank it up and make
sure<00:06:52.030> we're<00:06:52.270> getting<00:06:52.330> the<00:06:52.479> pressure<00:06:56.970> so<00:06:57.970> the

00:06:58.469 --> 00:06:58.479 
sure we're getting the pressure so the

00:06:58.479 --> 00:07:00.869 
sure we're getting the pressure so the
gauge<00:06:58.659> is<00:06:58.870> installed<00:06:59.400> we've<00:07:00.400> got<00:07:00.669> our

00:07:00.869 --> 00:07:00.879 
gauge is installed we've got our

00:07:00.879 --> 00:07:02.399 
gauge is installed we've got our
adequate<00:07:01.330> pressure<00:07:01.569> there<00:07:01.840> holding<00:07:02.169> on<00:07:02.289> the

00:07:02.399 --> 00:07:02.409 
adequate pressure there holding on the

00:07:02.409 --> 00:07:03.050 
adequate pressure there holding on the
line

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:03.060 
line

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:06.570 
line
there<00:07:04.060> is<00:07:04.210> no<00:07:04.449> leak<00:07:05.069> anywhere<00:07:06.069> around<00:07:06.280> the

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:06.580 
there is no leak anywhere around the

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:09.719 
there is no leak anywhere around the
unit<00:07:07.860> so<00:07:08.860> all<00:07:08.949> you<00:07:09.039> got<00:07:09.130> to<00:07:09.220> do<00:07:09.280> is<00:07:09.430> throw<00:07:09.550> the

00:07:09.719 --> 00:07:09.729 
unit so all you got to do is throw the

00:07:09.729 --> 00:07:11.279 
unit so all you got to do is throw the
engine<00:07:09.970> cover<00:07:10.150> back<00:07:10.360> on<00:07:10.569> there's<00:07:10.870> no<00:07:11.020> leaks

00:07:11.279 --> 00:07:11.289 
engine cover back on there's no leaks

00:07:11.289 --> 00:07:13.499 
engine cover back on there's no leaks
the<00:07:11.710> gauge<00:07:12.220> is<00:07:12.400> holding<00:07:12.669> pressure<00:07:12.880> the

00:07:13.499 --> 00:07:13.509 
the gauge is holding pressure the

00:07:13.509 --> 00:07:14.850 
the gauge is holding pressure the
installation<00:07:13.960> went<00:07:14.139> pretty<00:07:14.229> smoothly<00:07:14.650> and

00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:14.860 
installation went pretty smoothly and

installation went pretty smoothly and
the<00:07:14.919> whole<00:07:15.039> thing<00:07:15.280> took<00:07:15.460> I<00:07:15.729> don't<00:07:15.789> know<00:07:16.030> maybe

00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:16.240 
the whole thing took I don't know maybe

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:18.420 
the whole thing took I don't know maybe
20<00:07:16.479> minutes<00:07:16.750> not<00:07:17.560> bad<00:07:17.800> at<00:07:17.919> all<00:07:17.979> just<00:07:18.250> to<00:07:18.310> make
