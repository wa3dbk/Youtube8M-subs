don't<00:02:50.930> I<00:02:51.050> don't<00:02:51.080> get<00:02:51.470> it<00:02:51.620> I<00:02:54.190> don't<00:02:55.190> get<00:02:55.459> it<00:02:55.670> Rene

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:07.810 

okay<00:03:03.560> I'm<00:03:04.160> taking<00:03:04.430> um<00:03:05.300> and<00:03:06.160> then<00:03:07.160> then<00:03:07.550> let's

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:07.820 
okay I'm taking um and then then let's

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:27.760 
okay I'm taking um and then then let's
see

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:27.770 

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:34.240 

I<00:03:31.480> simply<00:03:32.480> fail<00:03:32.750> to<00:03:32.960> believe<00:03:33.080> that<00:03:33.470> so<00:03:34.040> I'm

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:34.250 
I simply fail to believe that so I'm

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:36.700 
I simply fail to believe that so I'm
taking<00:03:34.520> and<00:03:34.910> then<00:03:35.300> then<00:03:35.600> then<00:03:35.840> I'm<00:03:36.110> then<00:03:36.590> I'm

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:36.710 
taking and then then then I'm then I'm

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:41.560 
taking and then then then I'm then I'm
checking<00:03:37.400> the<00:03:37.550> details<00:03:38.740> okay<00:03:39.820> takes<00:03:40.820> b7<00:03:41.480> I

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:41.570 
checking the details okay takes b7 I

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:47.290 
checking the details okay takes b7 I
guess<00:03:41.840> right<00:03:45.130> it's<00:03:46.130> a<00:03:46.310> whole<00:03:46.520> piece<00:03:46.880> this<00:03:47.240> is

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:47.300 
guess right it's a whole piece this is

00:03:47.300 --> 00:04:04.640 
guess right it's a whole piece this is
the<00:03:47.750> this<00:03:48.080> is<00:03:48.140> the<00:03:48.290> thing<00:03:50.860> ok<00:03:52.270> Ruger<00:03:53.270> tool

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:07.950 

laughs<00:04:05.650> resign<00:04:06.430> this<00:04:06.970> is<00:04:07.090> nothing<00:04:07.540> and<00:04:07.720> we<00:04:07.780> can

a big disaster when you can probably try
to<00:04:19.359> hang<00:04:19.780> on<00:04:19.900> like<00:04:20.380> night<00:04:20.709> over<00:04:21.040> to<00:04:21.190> f5<00:04:21.519> but<00:04:21.880> I

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:22.080 
to hang on like night over to f5 but I

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:26.180 
to hang on like night over to f5 but I
think<00:04:23.080> that<00:04:23.110> this<00:04:23.710> is<00:04:23.890> this<00:04:24.010> is<00:04:24.190> a<00:04:24.370> rather

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.190 
think that this is this is a rather

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:30.300 
think that this is this is a rather
normal<00:04:27.190> line<00:04:27.960> but<00:04:28.960> I'm<00:04:29.440> not<00:04:29.860> really<00:04:30.190> sure

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:30.310 
normal line but I'm not really sure

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:34.830 
normal line but I'm not really sure
about<00:04:30.730> this<00:04:31.060> is<00:04:31.390> six<00:04:31.900> and<00:04:32.110> d5<00:04:33.100> build<00:04:33.460> up<00:04:33.840> after

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:34.840 
about this is six and d5 build up after

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:37.050 
about this is six and d5 build up after
e5<00:04:35.260> it<00:04:35.590> seems<00:04:35.830> that<00:04:36.040> white<00:04:36.280> is<00:04:36.310> better<00:04:36.700> if<00:04:36.940> he

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:37.060 
e5 it seems that white is better if he

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:39.270 
e5 it seems that white is better if he
goes<00:04:37.240> back<00:04:37.600> I<00:04:37.900> mean<00:04:38.110> I'd<00:04:38.260> he<00:04:38.410> only<00:04:38.620> has<00:04:38.890> he<00:04:39.100> aid

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:39.280
