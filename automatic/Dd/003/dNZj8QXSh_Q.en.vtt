00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:08.189
 hey i'm sag i 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.410
 we come to another episode 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.000
 my basecamp tricks in this episode 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.490
 it goes around my cooperation even 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.470
 not base camp and the 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:18.420
 satellite views of google if i did 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.160
 then prepare me for a tour 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.400
 I'll look at those first 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.060
 on my gaming basecap on the 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.529
 map 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.449
 then I have a rough one 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.650
 Overview why are extending away 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:32.279
 height lines, etc 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.870
 where exactly is the whole corner and if 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.030
 I did it then I like it 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.530
 very me a satellite view 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.120
 I usually do that in 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.730
 google maps if I am now 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.559
 the exact same as soon as possible 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.940
 would like to see here in google maps 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.460
 then I just imagine 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.750
 just as a waypoint going on here 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.030
 expanded and then I have the 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.629
 coordinates from this point the copy 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.980
 me me 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:58.289
 and I can easily get in here 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:03.719
 Enter google maps and come immediately 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:08.340
 in exactly the same place and can me 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:09.450
 look at the area here then 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.970
 you get a much better one 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.280
 Overview and what kind of territory 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.560
 there are sometimes even with 3d 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.670
 views you looked helpful in our 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.380
 alpine areas 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.909
 that looks really great because you can do that 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.159
 height gradient, etc 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.750
 pretty much recognize and can 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.060
 a good impression of the terrain 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:31.229
 provide 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:34.470
 yes , of course it is now that way 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.450
 I often come out here again and 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.600
 delete the waypoint that you often 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:43.740
 Of course a route has created that 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:48.659
 I'll do good for a while and now 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:51.990
 any double activity direct 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:53.700
 leads cross country won so i run 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.850
 put me here any cross country 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.130
 route and that's what I want on this 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:02.100
 against liked it so much 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:04.950
 it occurs now know, of course great if 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:07.170
 I also know the exact route in the 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.080
 google maps could see that is unfortunately 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.310
 no but 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.710
 what I can do is very helpful 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:14.020
 i can if i'm right here 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:16.060
 mouse click on my route make me the 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:17.950
 route in google earth ad and google 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:21.190
 earth works her with this 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:22.690
 google satellite stuff and then 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.680
 google opens, we bring that 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:24.700
 now very fast because the program 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.430
 already open 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:30.640
 but then you see exactly the route here 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:34.030
 you have just worked out in the basecamp 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:36.070
 have google earth and that is 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.380
 Of course, super helpful because then know 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:40.060
 You know exactly where you're going now 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:42.670
 Of course, here it is only a forest area 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:44.770
 but in other areas and much 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:48.430
 bigger good there that is very much 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:49.030
 Helpful I really like that one 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:50.730
 can make 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:53.950
 Some people feel a bit heavy 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:55.320
 in the basecamp on a drawn map 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:58.660
 to plan a route 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:01.630
 there are people who like it better 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:03.340
 a satellite view and there you can 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:05.290
 of course here with google earth 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:08.050
 I work It's just another 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:08.709
 other terrain here again only one 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:10.660
 example 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:15.330
 and he'll put me here fast now 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:17.040
 a good departure 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:20.640
 and now I can of course here 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:23.530
 somehow plan something 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:25.170
 here I want to go long made even 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:34.350
 not so long is he just an example again 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:38.019
 Sun and all I call my please 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:40.900
 ok i have them now and this one 

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:43.350
 new route looks a little bit here 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:43.350
 bad to see 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:50.410
 I can save this route now 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:56.440
 Place save as and I save it 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:59.550
 me now in a kml file on mine 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:59.550
 Secure the desk 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:06.310
 and if I never in mine now 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:10.920
 basecamp I can go to this kml file 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:10.920
 import via file import 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:19.019
 my route we are there then she is 

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:23.220
 here already displayed double click on it 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:27.150
 and here I have her and now I have 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:31.080
 exactly the same route I just 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:35.190
 just in google first drawn 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:36.870
 have here in my garmin basecamp 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:38.400
 Program moment is just a bit 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:41.310
 badly visible because it is gray 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:45.379
 just change the color to red 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:49.050
 he is much better to see that and 

00:04:45.379 --> 00:04:51.479
 so now I have my route on the 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:54.750
 satellite, view, she had drawn 

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:56.759
 then in my base camp to the administration 

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:58.860
 You can save over here 

00:04:56.759 --> 00:05:00.990
 and again in the simplest way and 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:04.409
 wisely on my garmin device plays 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:05.159
 mark again what gaming device 

00:05:04.409 --> 00:05:08.039
 plug in 

00:05:05.159 --> 00:05:10.770
 then it will be displayed up here 

00:05:08.039 --> 00:05:12.780
 send and the route is already in 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:15.810
 my garmin gets inside and i can 

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:18.240
 navigate outside after that so easy 

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:19.860
 The cooperation is very helpful 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:21.349
 to work with the satellite views 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:24.889
 I like it a lot 

00:05:21.349 --> 00:05:24.889
 until the next part
