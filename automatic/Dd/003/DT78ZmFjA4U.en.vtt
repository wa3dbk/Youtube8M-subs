00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:05.250
 good blitz session 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:10.519
 first game we're going to look 93 for 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:10.519
 start doctor from usa 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:18.890
 for a little bit fast because we already know that 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:22.360
 in bridge that is important and more to three 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:24.730
 minutes try not to stay 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:28.780
 will not be left behind in the clock is my 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:31.660
 main objective for a scheme that I've 

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:35.020
 used in some items that 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:38.170
 consists of putting your foot on the 4 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:40.510
 and then place it between two there's a 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:44.440
 trick if horse by c4 knight three 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:47.640
 by cayo there are many people who fall into this 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.640
 trick a trap 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.760
 it is given tower to 2 pawn per horse pardon 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.760
 yes tower to 2 bishop b1 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:59.750
 and if I gave the filipe an average of 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.750
 33 who do it 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:03.970
 delivering the opposite quality by 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:10.750
 good grade the quality so I can 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.750
 be quite happy 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:22.170
 but obviously starting the game 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:24.299
 continues but as you can see the trap is 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.439
 It's an easy trap to fall because it's not 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.439
 it is not absolutely obvious 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:34.260
 Now I have to play carefully because 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:37.240
 have some compensation for the quality 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:41.580
 So I can not neglect me 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:45.690
 I will try to play well and if I am able to 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:45.690
 take to good port 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:50.510
 let's try to put my pieces so 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.890
 best possible 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:53.890
 and we'll see 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:05.750
 ah 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.750
 because this column 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:10.009
 I do not have to do that too 

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:11.750
 I opened columns 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:13.460
 it's fine for me to change this cycle that 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:16.410
 it is also important 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:18.360
 who tries to avoid 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:21.590
 wants to play f5 I want to be 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.590
 prepared against this player 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.530
 so if f5 I will take and 40 mg 5 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:30.580
 doctor d 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:38.610
 and now comes the moment of truth 

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:41.900
 let's see if I get 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.900
 generate enough attack 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:47.010
 my idea is to play set 3 in some 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:50.489
 moment 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:55.519
 and go down the tower 8 ago to play tower 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:55.519
 of 818 g8 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:02.200
 but you can not miss either 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.700
 pawns see how they evolve they look for the 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.590
 change of ladies 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:08.540
 the change of ladies may be fine but 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:11.450
 I was really looking for the most 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:14.349
 that simply change the ladies 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:14.349
 but as I have quality emas 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:24.010
 to 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:25.959
 like the towers at stake 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:27.220
 in quality and two towers and many 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:29.049
 open colonies I think this has 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:32.579
 that be well also your pieces are 

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:32.579
 a little weird there on the kingside 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:37.290
 basically I'm going to put my towers 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:39.770
 the columns to see if he can win 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:39.770
 this game 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:42.820
 let's place now 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:49.130
 the well located towers to search 

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:51.380
 change of towers 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:53.570
 because you can eat fine eat all your 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:55.810
 pawns on the king's side and if it does not go 

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:57.190
 make the change korea steak 4 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:58.840
 so it practically has to change 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:01.239
 the moment the game is coming out 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.560
 pretty clean I can not be 

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:04.950
 discontent of how I am when this 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.950
 departure 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:17.350
 13 6 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:20.359
 it's annoying but here I think there was 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:23.980
 calculated to the boss 4 not 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:29.650
 reported report seems good 

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:29.650
 this play is correct I think so 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:32.510
 ah 

00:04:34.689 --> 00:04:40.330
 elsa defined quite well indeed 

00:04:36.839 --> 00:04:43.209
 well this pawn is I have to give and I'm going 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:44.919
 to put your tower pawn here has 

00:04:43.209 --> 00:04:46.839
 some merit tower here is not here 

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:48.039
 tower nor king king king king defend 

00:04:46.839 --> 00:04:51.989
 first and then came in with the tower by 

00:04:48.039 --> 00:04:51.989
 back if maybe it's cleaner 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:03.630
 I think this idea is cleaner because 

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:06.370
 simply oysters this one had not 

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:09.180
 for this new good 

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:09.180
 so there was not 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:16.790
 what does not happen but this has 

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:16.790
 complicated in popular the situation 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:29.870
 I will not complicate life now 

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:31.580
 not split so you clean up thank you I hope 

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:34.360
 that you liked interesting the 

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:34.360
 quality sacrifice 

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:43.270
 basically from this position here 

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:45.880
 now the romanes play 

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:47.680
 tower 1 and horse f1 or something like that and the 

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:51.180
 black placed the bishop now for this 

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:51.180
 diagonal which is very good between fixing 

00:05:51.729 --> 00:05:59.060
 14 4 in the order of the advantage but I 

00:05:56.710 --> 00:06:04.220
 I'm playing 

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:06.460
 on horseback of six of six bishop per pawn 

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:06.460
 by 

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:16.949
 no longer a tower but a horse 5 and a given time 5 

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:18.210
 I check this bus it seems super dangerous 

00:06:16.949 --> 00:06:21.030
 it seems that I could not do more this 

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:23.550
 good good variant I travel to this in 

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:25.410
 slow game and had won but clear 

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:28.979
 the 6-bishop horse per pawn 

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:31.229
 horse by towers caire 5 gave by 6 

00:06:28.979 --> 00:06:32.699
 of bird 5 check and this according to the module 

00:06:31.229 --> 00:06:35.280
 driving to fast defeat so 

00:06:32.699 --> 00:06:37.259
 have to change my strategy and no longer 

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:38.250
 to be able to play this again well 

00:06:37.259 --> 00:06:40.440
 that's what fast games are for 

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:42.840
 because like that in slow game I do not go 

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:45.780
 to place this therefore in game 

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:47.190
 slow against lady of 2 then I will not play at 

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:49.139
 freezer 2 but simply play 

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:50.250
 horse 7 to free 7 a long rocky that 

00:06:49.139 --> 00:06:50.669
 I have also practiced them in other 

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:53.520
 games 

00:06:50.669 --> 00:06:56.210
 therefore good to know 

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:56.210
 until next time
