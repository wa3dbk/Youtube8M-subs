 - facebook via degli armeni 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.110
 1 the pleasure of having the architect cino zucchi with us that hardly 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:15.110
 has withdrawn the work-life seal for the realization of the va salt project 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:17.470
 international car quoto 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:18.500
 what to say 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:19.499
 congratulations 

00:00:19.499 --> 00:00:20.859
 thanks and we are 

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:23.030
 we worked hard because the topic 

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:28.419
 it was very important from the point of view of the company to commission a company 

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:34.740
 that it has always proved to be a leader in sustainability by producing tools 

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:39.370
 renata torre high mountain clothing for which the climbers 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:43.540
 the know photo for paper also very technical clothing and we know 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:45.880
 which installers are also 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:49.520
 those that keep us very much leave the environment as they found it but if 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.430
 pay an ethics 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:54.450
 mountaineers that this sport is also transmitted 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:59.100
 the theme was very beautiful. itaque location is located bolzano a 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:00:59.940
 situation 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.390
 strange because the city is on the border between the fields 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.490
 consolidated and also on the highway but with the mountains in the background a building 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:09.320
 relevant. volumetric 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.000
 elia very interesting 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.830
 for the program that unites 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.200
 let's say space 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.270
 or the more traditional logistics instead the forest of rocks that will perhaps be the 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:20.590
 bigger than europe 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:22.090
 has a nursery 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:26.189
 also the advertising spaces for which also the programmatic formula the parts 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:26.910
 of the theme 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:29.150
 indeed sheep from Rome 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:34.350
 I was very interested in all that was the nurse analysis 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:35.750
 impact because 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:41.090
 currently the landscape contour its strength in fact then comes 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:45.310
 the project is broadcast and then there is another interesting part that has been 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:50.510
 presented before and that in any case this or this architecture becomes in some 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:55.110
 so even an entrance to the city so a kind of brings to the city a new one 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.160
 door 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.520
 in the end you could not say bifacial 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.280
 on your car the road of the fields search 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.070
 nas padova also on warehouses so even the same scale 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.500
 in the larger building and look for a synthetic vision of a silhouette 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:15.320
 given by a profile and by the skin that also for the one that shields itself from 

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:19.520
 south and west weirdly boast the city that welcomes the hot summers here 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:24.940
 cia sad theme matured here coincides the theme of an image with that also the 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:28.890
 protection towards the north-east instead of the side towards the industrial zone 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:33.139
 they open bends to form a sort of square 

00:02:33.139 --> 00:02:37.949
 the reception also collects the most public part of the titan free company 

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:42.539
 senaf lucky coincidence between image and instead structure and even its own 

00:02:42.539 --> 00:02:44.499
 model of seats in the city 

00:02:44.499 --> 00:02:49.909
 + gave you the best away from the south and west and instead more and the next 

00:02:50.899 --> 00:02:52.430
 towards the Roman gate 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:56.000
 ecopol other thing absolutely interesting this art project 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:00.849
 naturally both the aesthetic part and the skin as she called it 

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:04.299
 but above all a new concept of 

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:06.969
 of what life is to keep alive 

00:03:06.969 --> 00:03:09.239
 because it takes place inside not only 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:11.749
 life tied to what is an activity 

00:03:11.749 --> 00:03:15.599
 commercial industry but precisely what can be a different one 

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:17.579
 conception of the working man 

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:21.279
 what is interesting that the company owner is good at him as a person 

00:03:21.279 --> 00:03:22.709
 a person 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:26.670
 extremely escape the photos means cells in your spare time 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:30.960
 pedal found a client who did not do it only for marketing reasons 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:33.959
 companies often have a duty to certify themselves 

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:37.779
 the photo that embodies the same person 

00:03:37.779 --> 00:03:38.859
 these values 

00:03:38.859 --> 00:03:42.309
 and these values ​​have been transmitted is the whole company today we were there to see 

00:03:42.309 --> 00:03:44.159
 the furniture and said 

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:47.799
 because all the feces I cooked more we want to do a thing where 

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:49.690
 executive offices are 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:53.899
 do not stand out from the other chante map of internal tuna democracy 

00:03:53.899 --> 00:03:56.979
 and having almost little agreement to have a tone too 

00:03:56.979 --> 00:04:00.629
 office space so this brings life 

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:05.170
 domestic also in its various activities within the space perhaps 

00:04:05.169 --> 00:04:10.200
 also to relate to an audience is what the tomb may be 

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:11.829
 tried three years ago 

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:15.840
 let me show you all the offers for approx. also heard about 

00:04:15.839 --> 00:04:16.419
 costs 

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:21.239
 kitchens of spaces included because before there cannot be even for the 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:22.809
 spaces for 

00:04:22.809 --> 00:04:25.010
 dependent snow children 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:29.820
 that average + o- looks domestic rather than sky work 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:33.960
 there is some kitchen that there is this beautiful terrace a certain height 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.840
 warehouse attic that faces south and fields 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:40.550
 and there is the kitchen after noon people can go and cook 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:45.750
 eat ecor and then of course everything that is related to the appearance 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:50.800
 landscaping because then we saw that part of the project also 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:54.889
 defined by a park that then relates to architecture and architecture 

00:04:54.889 --> 00:04:58.580
 rock gym a kind of large space with cable 

00:04:59.389 --> 00:05:02.410
 a little the one that opens up the summer so he can 

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:06.940
 host manifestation and manifestations and sin becomes the stage 

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:08.970
 outdoors of this 

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:12.440
 big space so it's not a private business thing too 

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:16.810
 competition can take place on the other side there is this seen that 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:19.349
 embraces the space looking at ipad 

00:05:19.349 --> 00:05:23.270
 we start the green and also from life because that to illustrate needs 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:24.499
 of volleyball with others 

00:05:24.499 --> 00:05:26.729
 one works only put jonas to eat 

00:05:26.729 --> 00:05:31.400
 via we hope to manga visitation tights fabric effect industrial area 

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:36.270
 here are reds in the August introduction forget. echo the person he is 

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:39.120
 intervened proceeding mind. I said. 

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:43.930
 we can no longer limit ourselves to alerting energy efficiency only 

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:49.960
 but it must. work on the quality of life I believe this 

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:54.830
 synergistically and put together all these things a touch the result is 

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:56.119
 state awards 

00:05:56.119 --> 00:06:00.479
 year is also like tradition as we still have a lot of song 

00:06:00.479 --> 00:06:01.650
 photo to the theme 

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:05.529
 let's say what the design of the human mind in general is today 

00:06:05.529 --> 00:06:09.629
 over-specialization tends to give up 

00:06:09.629 --> 00:06:15.229
 efficient at most single piece but by photo 3 pieces if missed this theme by 

00:06:15.229 --> 00:06:19.330
 put things back together for example fairies territorial cc is making 

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:23.530
 account that heidi American suburban model an energy expenditure for i 

00:06:23.529 --> 00:06:24.969
 crazy transports 

00:06:24.969 --> 00:06:30.039
 we are in the whole of europe, redensifying nearby. public transport. which 

00:06:30.949 --> 00:06:33.099
 and especially understanding that 

00:06:33.099 --> 00:06:35.100
 also certain density levels 

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:40.180
 Mapuche density in the mathematical sense I would say of promiscuity between the function 

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:45.520
 present or many cities have survived due to flexibility 

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:49.240
 of the relationship between home and work night of the apartments that becomes difficult then 

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:50.279
 of elba apartments 

00:06:50.279 --> 00:06:51.090
 today 

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:53.830
 too specialized buildings die 

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:57.779
 with their function we think of abandoned shopping centers after 10 years 

00:06:57.779 --> 00:07:02.080
 perhaps the theme of a long duration that has always been architecture 

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:03.460
 cake recipe 

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:06.460
 rice drink if proposed today as a theme 

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:12.330
 respect we could also say that architecture often survives 

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:16.520
 physically to the programmed generated and this is also because of legs ne 

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:19.449
 ancient cities are 2 move cost a city in thirty years 

00:07:19.449 --> 00:07:21.370
 twitter but of durability 

00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:26.030
 all the themes seem to me to be the integration of mobility 

00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:28.569
 cuochella if circles of 

00:07:28.569 --> 00:07:32.970
 starting from the energy base that the fundamental theme casaclima 

00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:36.610
 you articulate copying in this direction 

00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:38.300
 thank you very much also for you thanks
