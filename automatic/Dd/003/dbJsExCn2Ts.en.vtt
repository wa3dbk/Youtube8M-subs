weapons<00:01:45.630> spawn<00:01:46.070> three-minute<00:01:47.070> intervals<00:01:47.340> so

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
weapons spawn three-minute intervals so

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.789 
weapons spawn three-minute intervals so
if<00:01:48.210> they<00:01:48.390> start<00:01:48.630> at<00:01:48.720> 12<00:01:48.930> it's<00:01:49.170> gonna<00:01:49.320> be

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
if they start at 12 it's gonna be

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.139 
if they start at 12 it's gonna be
spawning<00:01:50.070> at<00:01:50.280> nine<00:01:50.460> it's<00:01:50.700> gonna<00:01:50.850> be<00:01:50.939> spawning

don't<00:02:01.070> but<00:02:02.070> so<00:02:02.250> here<00:02:02.430> in<00:02:02.520> place<00:02:02.729> with<00:02:02.939> random

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
don't but so here in place with random

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.010 
don't but so here in place with random
teammates<00:02:03.600> and<00:02:04.490> unfortunately<00:02:05.780> we<00:02:06.780> couldn't

necessarily overcome the handicap of the

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.170 
necessarily overcome the handicap of the
worst<00:02:09.629> of<00:02:09.780> the<00:02:09.929> four<00:02:10.530> players<00:02:10.800> um<00:02:11.220> there<00:02:12.090> was

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
worst of the four players um there was

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.880 
worst of the four players um there was
one<00:02:12.360> guy<00:02:12.510> who<00:02:12.540> went<00:02:12.870> three<00:02:13.200> and<00:02:13.230> seven

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
one guy who went three and seven

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.430 
one guy who went three and seven
teen<00:02:14.069> or<00:02:14.220> 3<00:02:14.460> and<00:02:14.580> 18<00:02:14.670> I<00:02:14.940> think<00:02:15.150> um<00:02:15.410> and<00:02:16.410> that

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
teen or 3 and 18 I think um and that

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.500 
teen or 3 and 18 I think um and that
that<00:02:17.130> really<00:02:17.310> hurt<00:02:17.550> us<00:02:17.640> we<00:02:17.850> ended<00:02:18.030> up<00:02:18.090> losing

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
that really hurt us we ended up losing

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.740 
that really hurt us we ended up losing
by<00:02:18.990> a<00:02:19.020> tiny<00:02:19.290> margin<00:02:20.090> but<00:02:21.090> I<00:02:21.150> just<00:02:21.600> couldn't

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
by a tiny margin but I just couldn't

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.570 
by a tiny margin but I just couldn't
really<00:02:22.080> come<00:02:22.319> back<00:02:22.530> for<00:02:22.800> him<00:02:22.860> it<00:02:23.010> from<00:02:23.250> it<00:02:23.370> I

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
really come back for him it from it I

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.160 
really come back for him it from it I
guess<00:02:23.940> I<00:02:24.030> should<00:02:24.180> have<00:02:24.270> I<00:02:24.510> should<00:02:24.930> have<00:02:25.020> died

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
guess I should have I should have died

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.500 
guess I should have I should have died
as<00:02:25.319> many<00:02:25.500> times<00:02:25.740> as<00:02:25.890> I<00:02:26.069> I<00:02:26.310> did<00:02:26.730> myself<00:02:26.940> I<00:02:27.330> think

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
as many times as I I did myself I think

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:32.030 
as many times as I I did myself I think
I<00:02:27.569> went<00:02:27.780> 20<00:02:28.200> and<00:02:28.230> 15<00:02:28.920> this<00:02:28.950> match<00:02:29.310> or<00:02:29.610> 20<00:02:30.150> and<00:02:31.040> 20

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040

two weeks I one halfway why don't I set
out<00:02:49.050> there<00:02:49.290> so<00:02:50.040> it's<00:02:50.340> one<00:02:50.489> and<00:02:50.550> a<00:02:50.610> half<00:02:50.670> weeks

to what i was thinking of prior to that

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:05.930 
to what i was thinking of prior to that
that<00:03:04.530> a<00:03:04.560> lot<00:03:04.830> of<00:03:04.860> people<00:03:04.980> said<00:03:05.430> I<00:03:05.459> was<00:03:05.640> retarded

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
that a lot of people said I was retarded

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.300 
that a lot of people said I was retarded
for<00:03:06.239> was<00:03:07.050> the<00:03:07.140> fact<00:03:07.320> that<00:03:07.470> yes<00:03:07.739> Mon<00:03:07.980> referred

for was the fact that yes Mon referred
to<00:03:08.459> was<00:03:08.670> still<00:03:08.850> at<00:03:09.000> the<00:03:09.060> top<00:03:09.090> of<00:03:09.269> the<00:03:09.510> live

to was still at the top of the live

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.960 
to was still at the top of the live
charts<00:03:10.019> followed<00:03:10.620> closely<00:03:10.920> by<00:03:11.310> halo<00:03:11.580> three

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
charts followed closely by halo three

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:15.410 
charts followed closely by halo three
and<00:03:13.070> not<00:03:14.070> not<00:03:14.220> followed<00:03:14.580> closely<00:03:14.790> by<00:03:15.090> referred

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
and not not followed closely by referred

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.780 
and not not followed closely by referred
to<00:03:15.540> was<00:03:15.690> was<00:03:15.900> ahead<00:03:16.200> and<00:03:16.470> a<00:03:16.530> fairly<00:03:17.130> good<00:03:17.550> lead

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
to was was ahead and a fairly good lead

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:19.819 
to was was ahead and a fairly good lead
and<00:03:18.000> then<00:03:18.750> it<00:03:18.810> was<00:03:18.930> halo<00:03:19.110> 3<00:03:19.410> and<00:03:19.530> followed<00:03:19.799> very

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:19.829 
and then it was halo 3 and followed very

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:23.420 
and then it was halo 3 and followed very
closely<00:03:20.040> by<00:03:20.489> halo<00:03:20.670> 3<00:03:20.940> was<00:03:21.060> reach<00:03:21.239> on<00:03:21.570> so<00:03:22.430> that's

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
closely by halo 3 was reach on so that's

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:25.069 
closely by halo 3 was reach on so that's
something<00:03:23.610> that<00:03:23.730> we<00:03:23.910> might<00:03:24.060> see<00:03:24.269> be<00:03:24.480> seeing<00:03:24.840> on

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:25.079 
something that we might see be seeing on

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:27.830 
something that we might see be seeing on
next<00:03:25.560> results<00:03:25.950> so<00:03:26.549> he<00:03:26.820> is<00:03:26.940> obviously<00:03:27.299> going

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
next results so he is obviously going

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.270 
next results so he is obviously going
down<00:03:28.079> there<00:03:28.320> to<00:03:28.350> try<00:03:28.620> and<00:03:28.650> get<00:03:28.829> the<00:03:28.920> Rockets

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
down there to try and get the Rockets

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:30.650 
down there to try and get the Rockets
again<00:03:29.519> because<00:03:29.790> they<00:03:29.910> are<00:03:30.030> spawning<00:03:30.329> soon

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
again because they are spawning soon

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:32.870 
again because they are spawning soon
they<00:03:31.320> don't<00:03:31.500> stay<00:03:32.190> spawn<00:03:32.459> and<00:03:32.640> regular

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
they don't stay spawn and regular

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.370 
they don't stay spawn and regular
three-minute<00:03:33.390> intervals<00:03:33.630> based<00:03:33.989> on<00:03:34.140> when<00:03:34.290> you

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
three-minute intervals based on when you

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:35.630 
three-minute intervals based on when you
take<00:03:34.590> them<00:03:34.769> so<00:03:34.980> they're<00:03:35.130> not<00:03:35.220> going<00:03:35.280> to<00:03:35.430> spawn

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 
take them so they're not going to spawn

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:39.229 
take them so they're not going to spawn
and<00:03:35.790> see<00:03:35.910> their<00:03:36.470> Dada<00:03:37.470> so<00:03:38.370> if<00:03:38.700> you<00:03:38.850> take<00:03:39.030> them

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
and see their Dada so if you take them

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:41.270 
and see their Dada so if you take them
30<00:03:39.450> seconds<00:03:39.840> in<00:03:39.930> there<00:03:40.049> going<00:03:40.170> to<00:03:40.230> spawn<00:03:40.440> 30

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
30 seconds in there going to spawn 30

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.610 
30 seconds in there going to spawn 30
seconds<00:03:41.670> later<00:03:41.940> so<00:03:42.810> you<00:03:42.870> just<00:03:42.959> to<00:03:43.260> account<00:03:43.530> for

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
seconds later so you just to account for

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:47.509 
seconds later so you just to account for
that<00:03:43.829> and<00:03:44.100> that<00:03:44.640> guy<00:03:44.880> I<00:03:45.500> unfortunately<00:03:46.519> press

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:52.530 
of that in game it basically looks like

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:53.990 
of that in game it basically looks like
a<00:04:52.560> cloud<00:04:52.949> over<00:04:53.220> your<00:04:53.430> head<00:04:53.490> and<00:04:53.820> then

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:54.000 
a cloud over your head and then

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.730 
a cloud over your head and then
lightning<00:04:54.360> covering<00:04:54.720> your<00:04:54.810> body<00:04:54.960> which<00:04:55.710> is

lightning covering your body which is

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:57.800 
lightning covering your body which is
kind<00:04:56.100> of<00:04:56.160> cool<00:04:56.220> um<00:04:56.610> if<00:04:56.970> the<00:04:57.060> cloud<00:04:57.300> was<00:04:57.479> above

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:57.810 
kind of cool um if the cloud was above

00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:59.330 
kind of cool um if the cloud was above
your<00:04:58.020> head<00:04:58.169> and<00:04:58.350> maybe<00:04:58.590> just<00:04:58.949> like<00:04:59.070> just

00:04:59.330 --> 00:04:59.340 
your head and maybe just like just

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:00.950 
your head and maybe just like just
around<00:04:59.639> the<00:04:59.880> static<00:05:00.210> was<00:05:00.360> just<00:05:00.570> around<00:05:00.780> your

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:00.960 
around the static was just around your

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:03.469 
around the static was just around your
face<00:05:01.169> that<00:05:01.410> meat<00:05:01.699> cooler<00:05:02.699> if<00:05:03.000> you'd<00:05:03.150> like<00:05:03.270> wrap

have teamspeak enabling the game chat I
don't<00:05:55.440> think<00:05:55.889> I'm<00:05:56.070> not<00:05:56.250> one<00:05:56.400> hundred<00:05:56.460> percent

00:05:56.629 --> 00:05:56.639 
don't think I'm not one hundred percent

00:05:56.639 --> 00:05:58.879 
don't think I'm not one hundred percent
positive<00:05:57.110> i'm<00:05:58.110> not<00:05:58.320> sure<00:05:58.560> if<00:05:58.620> there's<00:05:58.800> any

00:05:58.879 --> 00:05:58.889 
positive i'm not sure if there's any

00:05:58.889 --> 00:06:00.379 
positive i'm not sure if there's any
audio<00:05:59.280> volume<00:05:59.430> at<00:05:59.699> all<00:05:59.820> i<00:05:59.970> think<00:06:00.030> they're

00:06:00.379 --> 00:06:00.389 
audio volume at all i think they're

00:06:00.389 --> 00:06:02.029 
audio volume at all i think they're
there<00:06:00.570> has<00:06:00.720> to<00:06:00.900> be<00:06:00.930> if<00:06:01.110> i<00:06:01.199> recorded<00:06:01.590> in<00:06:01.710> theater

00:06:02.029 --> 00:06:02.039 
there has to be if i recorded in theater

00:06:02.039 --> 00:06:05.180 
there has to be if i recorded in theater
i<00:06:02.250> would<00:06:02.729> assume<00:06:02.820> so<00:06:03.500> so<00:06:04.500> here<00:06:04.710> we're<00:06:04.889> starting

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:05.190 
i would assume so so here we're starting

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:07.400 
i would assume so so here we're starting
to<00:06:05.250> lose<00:06:05.430> the<00:06:05.610> lead<00:06:05.760> a<00:06:05.820> bit<00:06:06.139> but<00:06:07.139> i<00:06:07.169> have<00:06:07.380> a

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:07.410 
to lose the lead a bit but i have a

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:09.379 
to lose the lead a bit but i have a
couple<00:06:07.800> of<00:06:07.949> decent<00:06:08.130> plays<00:06:08.520> after<00:06:08.820> this<00:06:09.120> and

00:06:09.379 --> 00:06:09.389 
couple of decent plays after this and

00:06:09.389 --> 00:06:12.589 
couple of decent plays after this and
yeah<00:06:10.320> so<00:06:10.530> I<00:06:10.770> don't<00:06:11.370> know<00:06:11.550> it<00:06:12.150> seems<00:06:12.180> like<00:06:12.419> the

00:06:12.589 --> 00:06:12.599 
yeah so I don't know it seems like the

00:06:12.599 --> 00:06:14.360 
yeah so I don't know it seems like the
maps<00:06:12.810> are<00:06:12.990> relatively<00:06:13.349> limited<00:06:13.560> my

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:14.370 
maps are relatively limited my

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:15.860 
maps are relatively limited my
assumption<00:06:14.940> for<00:06:15.120> what<00:06:15.270> they're<00:06:15.419> doing<00:06:15.720> is

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:15.870 
assumption for what they're doing is

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:18.260 
assumption for what they're doing is
actually<00:06:16.050> the<00:06:16.770> same<00:06:16.979> thing<00:06:17.190> that<00:06:17.310> my<00:06:17.610> workers

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:18.270 
actually the same thing that my workers

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:20.510 
actually the same thing that my workers
who<00:06:18.419> did<00:06:18.630> is<00:06:19.050> that<00:06:19.080> because<00:06:19.770> there<00:06:20.130> are

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:20.520 
who did is that because there are

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:22.760 
who did is that because there are
relatively<00:06:21.210> small<00:06:21.479> amount<00:06:21.750> of<00:06:21.810> maps<00:06:22.080> what

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:22.770 
relatively small amount of maps what

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:23.600 
relatively small amount of maps what
they're<00:06:22.860> going<00:06:22.949> to<00:06:23.010> do<00:06:23.190> is<00:06:23.310> they're<00:06:23.430> going<00:06:23.460> to

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:23.610 
they're going to do is they're going to

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:27.260 
they're going to do is they're going to
state<00:06:23.849> save<00:06:24.270> on<00:06:24.599> the<00:06:25.530> expansion<00:06:26.130> maps<00:06:26.370> on<00:06:26.760> the
