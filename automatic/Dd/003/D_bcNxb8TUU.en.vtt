00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:11.760
 I 'm tired of Nathan Kevin and the cake 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.390
 in this own body with have about the 

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:15.660
 wait a long time 

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:17.310
 htc one s has researched 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.800
 how people use media on one 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.920
 mobile phone such as music videos 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:25.740
 and social media presentation of license 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.700
 that power is best if these were 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.070
 blinkfeed 

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:31.320
 htc blink feed emerges directly 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.669
 down until it goes into hibernation 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.230
 you can find sit link completely 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.210
 used 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.180
 so you can last your facebook in cells 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.410
 news and 19 even sports results 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.270
 thanks to the two on the front 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.800
 placed speakers comes one 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.300
 nice for sound in this device 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.220
 because of this you finally have it again 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.550
 smartphone that is worth going to 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:49.550
 to listen 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.460
 we increasingly see smartphone with 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.489
 asters less 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:59.399
 but since tv the app that delivers html 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.890
 do this just a little further 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.540
 namely also a TV guides built in you 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:07.139
 completely to your own taste and preferences 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:08.310
 choosing with camera clare had its whole 

00:01:07.139 --> 00:01:10.200
 new movement 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.539
 do not use a megapixel camera 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.280
 but ultra-pixel camera 

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:16.829
 This means that you travel less with 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.869
 fewer exposed photos and better photos 

00:01:16.829 --> 00:01:20.759
 with fast moving objects such as with 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.039
 sport witse 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:25.529
 With HTC One it is possible to get a solid one 

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:27.359
 but so is a series of a tank of photos 

00:01:25.529 --> 00:01:29.069
 complete for three seconds 

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:30.479
 this not only gives beautiful effects 

00:01:29.069 --> 00:01:32.130
 but it is also handy if you 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:35.159
 For example, unwanted people 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.200
 want to get a photo or at your points 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.630
 I think the large device has a nice one 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.310
 screen large full hd 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.549
 also has a super good listener 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.380
 and time is camera and fed 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:48.509
 I am Nathan Kevin in this was the he 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.599
 also no bead the pool until next 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.599
 times
