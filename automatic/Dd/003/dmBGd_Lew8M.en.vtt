00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140 
books are written in layers and the

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:08.680 
books are written in layers and the
first<00:03:06.650> draft<00:03:06.980> is<00:03:07.280> usually<00:03:07.940> messy<00:03:08.480> and

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:08.690 
first draft is usually messy and

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:11.259 
first draft is usually messy and
terrible<00:03:09.320> but<00:03:09.830> that's<00:03:10.100> just<00:03:10.310> layer<00:03:10.550> one<00:03:10.940> and

00:03:11.259 --> 00:03:11.269 
terrible but that's just layer one and

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:13.449 
terrible but that's just layer one and
with<00:03:11.540> every<00:03:11.930> new<00:03:12.170> layer<00:03:12.470> you<00:03:12.800> build<00:03:13.070> upon<00:03:13.430> that

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:13.459 
with every new layer you build upon that

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:15.790 
with every new layer you build upon that
it<00:03:13.910> gets<00:03:14.120> better<00:03:14.480> and<00:03:14.780> better<00:03:14.810> you<00:03:15.440> can

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:15.800 
it gets better and better you can

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.640 
it gets better and better you can
improve<00:03:16.459> and<00:03:16.850> fix<00:03:17.120> a<00:03:17.329> messy<00:03:17.840> draft<00:03:18.200> but<00:03:18.530> you

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
improve and fix a messy draft but you

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:21.759 
improve and fix a messy draft but you
can't<00:03:18.980> improve<00:03:19.540> nothing<00:03:20.540> you<00:03:21.049> need<00:03:21.350> that

00:03:21.759 --> 00:03:21.769 
can't improve nothing you need that

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:24.100 
can't improve nothing you need that
first<00:03:22.190> messy<00:03:22.730> draft<00:03:23.060> and<00:03:23.329> then<00:03:23.510> you<00:03:23.630> can<00:03:23.810> build

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:24.110 
first messy draft and then you can build

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:26.530 
first messy draft and then you can build
on<00:03:24.320> that<00:03:24.350> now<00:03:24.860> my<00:03:25.340> ultimate<00:03:25.730> goal<00:03:26.060> is

least if it's in your mind it should be
in<00:03:50.209> like<00:03:50.390> some<00:03:50.720> back<00:03:51.049> little<00:03:51.410> corner<00:03:51.799> locked

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:52.070 
in like some back little corner locked

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:54.340 
in like some back little corner locked
up<00:03:52.310> and<00:03:52.519> gagged<00:03:52.760> because<00:03:53.360> when<00:03:53.630> drafting<00:03:53.900> you

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:54.350 
up and gagged because when drafting you

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:56.319 
up and gagged because when drafting you
definitely<00:03:54.980> do<00:03:55.160> not<00:03:55.190> need<00:03:55.430> thoughts<00:03:56.000> like

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:56.329 
definitely do not need thoughts like

00:03:56.329 --> 00:03:58.600 
definitely do not need thoughts like
this<00:03:57.079> never<00:03:57.290> gonna<00:03:57.560> get<00:03:57.709> published<00:03:58.160> that

00:03:58.600 --> 00:03:58.610 
this never gonna get published that

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:00.729 
this never gonna get published that
just<00:03:59.120> that's<00:03:59.329> not<00:03:59.540> helpful<00:03:59.870> when<00:04:00.290> drafting

00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:00.739 
just that's not helpful when drafting

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:03.720 
just that's not helpful when drafting
your<00:04:01.370> goal<00:04:01.730> is<00:04:02.030> a<00:04:02.060> complete<00:04:02.690> draft<00:04:03.049> not

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:03.730 
your goal is a complete draft not

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:05.800 
your goal is a complete draft not
publication<00:04:04.730> so<00:04:05.090> it's<00:04:05.299> important<00:04:05.750> to

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:05.810 
publication so it's important to

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:08.140 
publication so it's important to
remember<00:04:06.230> that<00:04:06.410> and<00:04:06.829> to<00:04:07.160> kind<00:04:07.400> of<00:04:07.489> narrow<00:04:07.790> your

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:08.150 
remember that and to kind of narrow your

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:10.210 
remember that and to kind of narrow your
focus<00:04:08.209> on<00:04:08.900> that<00:04:09.079> don't<00:04:09.590> look<00:04:09.769> at<00:04:09.890> the<00:04:10.040> big

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:10.220
