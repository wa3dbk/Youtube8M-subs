00:00:02.449 --> 00:00:08.160
 this power to turn one's eyes towards a 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:11.630
 project and work on it 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.630
 it's a pretty cool thing 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:21.210
 It was a building that functioned am one 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:25.759
 car dealer on the neighboring side 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:29.310
 of the regional council wrc building and 

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:31.410
 this terrain and if we were to demolish 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.850
 the building we asked for potential 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.170
 construction of the site were 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.150
 incorporated 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.400
 so we made the decision to just 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:40.830
 to do a renovation is we said kaz 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:44.190
 with pre left the structure part and 

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:46.530
 ended up doing the work on top of that 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.930
 skeleton of the building then the idea 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.900
 of the building that is legal to us 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:55.229
 made a giant table on four pillars 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:56.879
 new ones that fit on top of the building 

00:00:55.229 --> 00:01:00.510
 for us to be able to put a 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:03.269
 cover 90 results in the structure 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.880
 running exactly that 

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:08.490
 made four holes in the bottom is as if the 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:11.820
 people took a 28-meter table by 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:14.750
 14 of placing on top of the building to 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.750
 make the new coverage 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:25.760
 demolished the first five meters of the 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:28.130
 the front duct will create a 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:30.950
 existing alignment and 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:33.970
 reinforced the initial idea I want to work 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:37.670
 base at great time reformed people might 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:41.150
 strengthen and hence on that basis and 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:42.910
 The idea of having a more public building is 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:46.100
 ended up giving some work that is a 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:49.430
 rescuing the building structure is very 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:51.530
 was already in the 1960s and was 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:52.790
 but the result was legal because 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.640
 how we had a very good goal 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:56.990
 vertical and this is a horizontal volume 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:00.770
 ended up doing a good composition 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:03.010
 interesting is where the conjunction of 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:06.590
 volume practiced with horizontal is 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:09.560
 originated to an entrance access where 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:12.130
 linked the two buildings and ended up 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:15.880
 having a system of ramps and connections 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:15.880
 interesting with a green area 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:28.000
 in the first phase we did almost 20 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:32.320
 years ago we were very focused 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:36.340
 in the matter of discussing everyone 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:39.670
 Wrong has no animal le pen has ceiling 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:41.950
 garden has clothing without all these 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:46.660
 issues handled in a way that the 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:49.450
 people found it interesting in that place 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:51.820
 in the second moment 20 years later is the 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:54.160
 We treated the building that was a box 

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:56.140
 closed by a condition that people 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:03:00.700
 have to appropriate the structure 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:02.740
 existing one a look a little more 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.840
 complementary contemporary of that 

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:09.880
 building using the track entitled to a 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:14.650
 investment that moves the wood to 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:18.670
 tablet was also used pasta at last 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:20.350
 also denise was wore a basket of 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:22.360
 materials that are a bit more distinct 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:25.600
 first building that was but was 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:29.220
 made easy white gray and old cache 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:29.220
 I would like to congratulate you 

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:43.130
 the interior garden very large communication 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:46.010
 digital control unit located in a building 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:48.200
 the other side has a ranking system 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:51.020
 and accessibility also role of Dr. 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:53.300
 the two buildings did not have the same level or 

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:56.870
 the attributes of the model we used 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:04:00.500
 there are five correct until now, then you have 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:04.780
 the glass pipe floor ceiling one 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:07.670
 Brilliance lighting control 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:11.900
 work perfectly until today they are 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:13.100
 there works a staff like works 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:15.410
 good 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:17.510
 then those attributes of the model that the 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:20.420
 people used in the first building and transposed 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:24.110
 some the second building I think they 

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:26.780
 the most important note is because the 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:29.240
 The pace is very personal to me, Roberto. 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:32.180
 today, but I think it has a series of 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:35.330
 taxes, which are already sustainable 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:37.990
 were sustained in the past that today 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.990
 it works perfectly
