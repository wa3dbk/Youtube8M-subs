you can draw around if you can't get

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.290 
you can draw around if you can't get
that<00:00:28.380> right<00:00:28.590> let<00:00:29.279> me<00:00:29.369> draw<00:00:29.550> a<00:00:29.580> line<00:00:29.820> kind<00:00:30.150> of

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
that right let me draw a line kind of

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.600 
that right let me draw a line kind of
across<00:00:30.599> the<00:00:31.019> middle<00:00:31.529> that<00:00:32.099> will<00:00:32.250> give<00:00:32.430> you<00:00:32.550> a

that's<00:00:44.820> his<00:00:45.180> face<00:00:45.960> really<00:00:46.500> isn't<00:00:46.620> it<00:00:46.800> there<00:00:46.980> we

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
that's his face really isn't it there we

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.760 
that's his face really isn't it there we
go<00:00:47.129> honey<00:00:47.370> has<00:00:47.610> a<00:00:47.640> few<00:00:47.910> head<00:00:48.090> sticking<00:00:48.329> up<00:00:48.770> and

go honey has a few head sticking up and
in<00:00:50.670> between<00:00:51.120> that<00:00:51.329> space<00:00:51.539> there<00:00:52.079> you<00:00:52.350> kind<00:00:52.559> of

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
in between that space there you kind of

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.799 
in between that space there you kind of
want<00:00:52.800> to<00:00:52.860> have<00:00:53.039> a<00:00:53.070> line<00:00:53.789> across<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:54.780> middle

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
want to have a line across the middle

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.569 
want to have a line across the middle
which<00:00:55.320> will<00:00:55.469> give<00:00:55.620> you<00:00:55.739> where<00:00:55.920> his<00:00:56.129> nose<00:00:56.370> is

which will give you where his nose is
going<00:00:56.760> to<00:00:56.850> be<00:00:57.059> and<00:00:57.649> his<00:00:58.649> eyes<00:00:59.010> will<00:00:59.969> kind<00:01:00.270> of

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
going to be and his eyes will kind of

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.660 
going to be and his eyes will kind of
rest<00:01:00.750> on<00:01:00.870> that<00:01:01.320> line<00:01:01.620> as<00:01:01.920> well<00:01:02.129> so<00:01:02.489> they're

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
rest on that line as well so they're

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.420 
rest on that line as well so they're
circles<00:01:03.619> and<00:01:04.619> then<00:01:04.739> underneath<00:01:05.070> that<00:01:05.220> you

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
circles and then underneath that you

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.230 
circles and then underneath that you
want<00:01:05.640> a<00:01:05.729> curve<00:01:06.030> and<00:01:06.869> then<00:01:06.990> a<00:01:07.020> curve<00:01:07.320> going<00:01:07.350> down

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:08.240 
want a curve and then a curve going down

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.570 
want a curve and then a curve going down
then<00:01:09.240> that<00:01:09.420> would<00:01:09.540> be<00:01:09.570> his<00:01:09.840> mouth<00:01:10.430> he's<00:01:11.430> gonna

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
then that would be his mouth he's gonna

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.179 
then that would be his mouth he's gonna
need<00:01:11.760> some<00:01:11.939> ears<00:01:12.240> as<00:01:12.479> well<00:01:12.689> on<00:01:12.900> the<00:01:13.020> side<00:01:13.229> we

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
need some ears as well on the side we

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.530 
need some ears as well on the side we
can<00:01:14.340> leave<00:01:14.490> it<00:01:14.640> like<00:01:14.790> that<00:01:14.820> for<00:01:15.000> the<00:01:15.180> moment

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
can leave it like that for the moment

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.679 
can leave it like that for the moment
now<00:01:15.990> his<00:01:16.229> spacesuit<00:01:16.970> he<00:01:17.970> has<00:01:18.150> these<00:01:18.330> kind<00:01:18.600> of

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
now his spacesuit he has these kind of

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.580 
now his spacesuit he has these kind of
rubber<00:01:19.350> seals<00:01:19.770> which<00:01:20.960> keep<00:01:21.960> all<00:01:22.140> the<00:01:22.290> air<00:01:22.409> in

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
rubber seals which keep all the air in

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:28.880 
rubber seals which keep all the air in
or<00:01:22.799> whatever<00:01:24.259> you<00:01:25.259> can<00:01:25.439> do<00:01:26.340> that<00:01:26.960> later<00:01:27.960> inside

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
or whatever you can do that later inside

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.800 
or whatever you can do that later inside
that's<00:01:29.340> kind<00:01:29.610> of<00:01:29.670> that's<00:01:30.150> the<00:01:30.270> back<00:01:30.420> anyway

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
that's kind of that's the back anyway

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.289 
that's kind of that's the back anyway
aha<00:01:31.530> so<00:01:32.130> you've<00:01:32.310> got<00:01:32.460> it's<00:01:32.880> kind<00:01:33.090> of<00:01:33.150> like<00:01:33.270> a

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
aha so you've got it's kind of like a

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.210 
aha so you've got it's kind of like a
sausage<00:01:33.780> and<00:01:34.020> then<00:01:34.470> you<00:01:34.590> want<00:01:34.740> to<00:01:34.770> bring<00:01:34.890> two

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
sausage and then you want to bring two

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.810 
sausage and then you want to bring two
lines<00:01:35.520> down<00:01:35.930> straight<00:01:36.930> down<00:01:37.460> there's<00:01:38.460> a<00:01:38.520> curve

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
lines down straight down there's a curve

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.390 
lines down straight down there's a curve
joining<00:01:39.570> them<00:01:39.840> at<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:40.049> bottom<00:01:40.200> and<00:01:40.860> then<00:01:41.310> the

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
joining them at the bottom and then the

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.030 
joining them at the bottom and then the
same<00:01:41.610> kind<00:01:41.880> of<00:01:41.939> sausage<00:01:42.329> shape<00:01:42.890> around<00:01:43.890> the

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
same kind of sausage shape around the

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.850 
same kind of sausage shape around the
bottom<00:01:44.399> there<00:01:44.750> if<00:01:45.750> you<00:01:45.899> draw<00:01:46.079> a<00:01:46.110> little<00:01:46.259> kind<00:01:46.740> a

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
bottom there if you draw a little kind a

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.980 
bottom there if you draw a little kind a
circle<00:01:47.460> another<00:01:47.880> one<00:01:48.149> with<00:01:48.329> a<00:01:48.360> circle<00:01:48.720> inside

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
circle another one with a circle inside

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.510 
circle another one with a circle inside
that's<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.409> zip<00:01:49.829> that<00:01:50.040> holds<00:01:50.369> it<00:01:50.430> all

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
that's the zip that holds it all

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.940 
that's the zip that holds it all
together<00:01:50.689> two<00:01:51.689> lines<00:01:51.960> down<00:01:52.259> below<00:01:52.590> and<00:01:52.860> a

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
together two lines down below and a

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.719 
together two lines down below and a
ladder<00:01:53.270> and<00:01:54.270> that<00:01:54.479> makes<00:01:54.750> the<00:01:55.350> zip<00:01:55.560> he<00:01:56.460> wants<00:01:56.700> a

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
ladder and that makes the zip he wants a

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.389 
ladder and that makes the zip he wants a
little<00:01:56.880> are<00:01:57.240> there<00:01:57.600> to<00:01:57.990> say<00:01:58.170> who<00:01:58.350> he<00:01:58.469> is<00:01:58.500> and<00:01:59.310> he

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
little are there to say who he is and he
