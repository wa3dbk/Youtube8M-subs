00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
the black once I have them cleaned I

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:24.910 
the black once I have them cleaned I
stored<00:02:21.190> about<00:02:22.190> two<00:02:22.520> dozen<00:02:22.730> in<00:02:23.239> a<00:02:23.750> jar<00:02:24.500> with

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
stored about two dozen in a jar with

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.280 
stored about two dozen in a jar with
kosher<00:02:25.190> salt<00:02:25.400> and<00:02:25.910> mortar<00:02:26.239> and<00:02:26.569> I<00:02:26.780> keep<00:02:27.020> it<00:02:27.170> in

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
kosher salt and mortar and I keep it in

some people just keep it in their garage
and<00:02:31.220> I<00:02:31.700> guess<00:02:31.910> that<00:02:32.120> works<00:02:32.360> but<00:02:32.660> I<00:02:32.690> like<00:02:32.959> to

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
and I guess that works but I like to

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:35.110 
and I guess that works but I like to
keep<00:02:33.230> it<00:02:33.410> in<00:02:33.530> the<00:02:33.620> refrigerator<00:02:33.790> the<00:02:34.790> salt

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
couple of weeks in that solution the

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.410 
couple of weeks in that solution the
rest<00:02:42.200> of<00:02:42.380> the<00:02:42.470> is<00:02:42.890> my<00:02:43.069> other<00:02:43.310> two<00:02:43.850> hundred<00:02:44.269> eel

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
rest of the is my other two hundred eel

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:49.210 
rest of the is my other two hundred eel
skins<00:02:44.810> I<00:02:45.769> have<00:02:46.430> frozen<00:02:47.060> in<00:02:47.510> deli<00:02:48.220> containers

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
skins I have frozen in deli containers

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.420 
skins I have frozen in deli containers
in<00:02:49.819> water<00:02:50.269> I<00:02:50.540> put<00:02:50.780> the<00:02:50.900> eel<00:02:51.050> skins<00:02:51.440> in<00:02:51.680> I<00:02:51.920> fill

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
in water I put the eel skins in I fill

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:54.250 
in water I put the eel skins in I fill
it<00:02:52.550> up<00:02:52.640> with<00:02:52.850> water<00:02:53.120> so<00:02:53.600> that<00:02:53.780> all<00:02:53.930> the<00:02:54.049> water

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
it up with water so that all the water

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.160 
it up with water so that all the water
causes<00:02:54.769> the<00:02:54.920> skins<00:02:55.220> and<00:02:55.549> then<00:02:56.510> I<00:02:56.630> freeze<00:02:56.930> them

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.170 
causes the skins and then I freeze them

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:59.050 
causes the skins and then I freeze them
that's<00:02:57.769> so<00:02:58.069> that<00:02:58.220> they<00:02:58.340> don't<00:02:58.489> get<00:02:58.700> freezer

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
that's so that they don't get freezer

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:03.220 
that's so that they don't get freezer
burn<00:03:01.060> so<00:03:02.060> that's<00:03:02.299> the<00:03:02.450> way<00:03:02.600> you<00:03:02.660> would<00:03:02.900> store

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
burn so that's the way you would store

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:07.059 
burn so that's the way you would store
them<00:03:04.120> for<00:03:05.120> future<00:03:05.390> use<00:03:05.620> now<00:03:06.620> I'm<00:03:06.739> going<00:03:06.950> to
