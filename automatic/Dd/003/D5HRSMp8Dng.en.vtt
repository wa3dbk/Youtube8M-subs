functioning<00:02:04.110> parts<00:02:04.500> they<00:02:04.649> pretty<00:02:04.860> much<00:02:04.920> just

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
functioning parts they pretty much just

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:06.469 
functioning parts they pretty much just
do<00:02:05.399> what<00:02:05.520> they<00:02:05.640> always<00:02:05.670> do<00:02:06.000> they<00:02:06.119> just<00:02:06.299> kind<00:02:06.450> of

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
do what they always do they just kind of

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.540 
do what they always do they just kind of
rename<00:02:06.810> it<00:02:06.990> but<00:02:07.740> on<00:02:07.860> something<00:02:08.220> I<00:02:08.340> found

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
rename it but on something I found

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.300 
rename it but on something I found
really<00:02:08.989> scary<00:02:09.989> is<00:02:10.470> the<00:02:10.679> fact<00:02:10.920> that<00:02:11.009> they<00:02:11.220> will

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
really scary is the fact that they will

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.710 
really scary is the fact that they will
be<00:02:11.370> bringing<00:02:11.670> joke<00:02:12.030> about<00:02:12.150> that

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
be bringing joke about that

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.410 
be bringing joke about that
but<00:02:13.290> speculation<00:02:14.190> is<00:02:14.580> it's<00:02:14.790> not<00:02:14.970> going<00:02:15.240> to<00:02:15.330> be

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
but speculation is it's not going to be

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.180 
but speculation is it's not going to be
