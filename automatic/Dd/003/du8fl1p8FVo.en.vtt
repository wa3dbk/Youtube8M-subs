okay what I'm going to show you here is
a<00:00:03.000> boost<00:00:03.780> leak<00:00:03.990> or<00:00:04.170> a<00:00:04.770> leak<00:00:05.220> problem<00:00:05.430> having<00:00:05.970> I

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:06.150 
a boost leak or a leak problem having I

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.490 
a boost leak or a leak problem having I
just<00:00:07.049> modded<00:00:07.500> this<00:00:07.950> is<00:00:08.519> 1g<00:00:08.820> blob<00:00:09.240> out<00:00:09.540> here<00:00:09.809> for

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
just modded this is 1g blob out here for

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.860 
just modded this is 1g blob out here for
the<00:00:10.679> Dodge<00:00:11.370> mod<00:00:11.730> I<00:00:11.759> took<00:00:12.210> and<00:00:12.450> tap<00:00:12.630> that<00:00:12.809> out

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
the Dodge mod I took and tap that out

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.580 
the Dodge mod I took and tap that out
put<00:00:13.740> a<00:00:13.769> set<00:00:14.610> screw<00:00:14.790> in<00:00:14.940> it<00:00:14.969> I<00:00:15.780> took<00:00:16.289> him<00:00:16.410> tap

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
put a set screw in it I took him tap

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.650 
put a set screw in it I took him tap
that<00:00:16.770> out<00:00:16.980> like<00:00:17.220> with<00:00:17.369> a<00:00:17.400> six<00:00:17.699> mil<00:00:17.940> I<00:00:18.210> used<00:00:18.539> the

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
that out like with a six mil I used the

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.630 
that out like with a six mil I used the
threaded<00:00:18.990> bolt<00:00:19.020> and<00:00:19.500> cut<00:00:19.920> it<00:00:20.010> off<00:00:20.160> and<00:00:20.369> I<00:00:20.460> use

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
threaded bolt and cut it off and I use

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.130 
threaded bolt and cut it off and I use
jb<00:00:20.939> weld<00:00:21.090> make<00:00:21.449> a<00:00:21.480> little<00:00:21.720> nipple<00:00:21.840> around<00:00:22.050> the

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
jb weld make a little nipple around the

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.929 
jb weld make a little nipple around the
end<00:00:22.350> so<00:00:22.500> that<00:00:22.529> it<00:00:22.710> seals<00:00:22.920> really<00:00:23.220> well<00:00:23.369> now

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
end so that it seals really well now

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.570 
end so that it seals really well now
once<00:00:24.119> I<00:00:24.210> got<00:00:24.359> this<00:00:24.510> to<00:00:24.660> seal<00:00:24.900> up<00:00:25.080> I<00:00:25.920> put<00:00:26.369> it<00:00:26.460> up

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
once I got this to seal up I put it up

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.910 
once I got this to seal up I put it up
top<00:00:26.820> and<00:00:27.330> I<00:00:27.420> rig<00:00:27.689> something<00:00:27.990> up<00:00:28.109> here<00:00:28.380> I<00:00:28.529> got<00:00:28.890> a

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
top and I rig something up here I got a

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.640 
top and I rig something up here I got a
UH<00:00:29.099> I<00:00:29.730> got<00:00:30.599> a<00:00:30.630> little<00:00:30.810> tee<00:00:31.019> here

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
UH I got a little tee here

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.360 
UH I got a little tee here
three<00:00:32.040> white<00:00:32.219> tee<00:00:32.489> right<00:00:33.210> and<00:00:33.860> one<00:00:34.860> side<00:00:35.070> is<00:00:35.100> my

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
three white tee right and one side is my

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.729 
three white tee right and one side is my
air<00:00:35.550> pressure<00:00:35.969> source<00:00:36.450> I<00:00:36.690> took<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:37.590> little

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
air pressure source I took the little

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.200 
air pressure source I took the little
regulator<00:00:38.129> on<00:00:38.250> the<00:00:38.309> compressor<00:00:38.610> put<00:00:38.969> it<00:00:39.059> about

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
regulator on the compressor put it about

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.569 
regulator on the compressor put it about
thirty<00:00:39.510> thirty<00:00:40.260> pounds<00:00:40.649> or<00:00:40.739> so

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
thirty thirty pounds or so

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.520 
thirty thirty pounds or so
and<00:00:41.879> then<00:00:42.090> this<00:00:42.239> runs<00:00:42.510> into<00:00:42.840> one<00:00:42.870> side<00:00:43.290> of<00:00:43.440> the

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
and then this runs into one side of the

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.360 
and then this runs into one side of the
tee<00:00:43.739> and<00:00:44.520> then<00:00:44.700> another<00:00:44.910> side<00:00:45.210> of<00:00:45.329> the<00:00:45.420> tee

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:46.370 
tee and then another side of the tee

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:51.500 
tee and then another side of the tee
runs<00:00:47.370> down<00:00:47.670> and<00:00:48.090> feeds<00:00:49.610> another<00:00:50.610> tee<00:00:50.879> here<00:00:51.329> and

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
runs down and feeds another tee here and

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.770 
runs down and feeds another tee here and
this<00:00:52.140> tee<00:00:52.410> feeds<00:00:53.219> the<00:00:53.489> top<00:00:53.760> port<00:00:54.120> and<00:00:54.329> the

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
this tee feeds the top port and the

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.660 
this tee feeds the top port and the
boots<00:00:54.989> cages<00:00:55.410> you<00:00:55.530> see<00:00:55.710> over<00:00:55.890> here<00:00:56.070> just<00:00:56.250> just

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
boots cages you see over here just just

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.010 
boots cages you see over here just just
to<00:00:56.789> regulate<00:00:57.180> pressure<00:00:57.449> I<00:00:57.660> have<00:00:57.840> another

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
to regulate pressure I have another

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.270 
to regulate pressure I have another
boost<00:00:58.260> gauge<00:00:58.379> sitting<00:00:58.680> around<00:00:58.800> so<00:00:59.010> I<00:00:59.039> hooked

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
boost gauge sitting around so I hooked

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.889 
boost gauge sitting around so I hooked
it<00:00:59.370> up<00:00:59.489> so<00:00:59.699> I<00:00:59.730> know<00:00:59.789> how<00:01:00.000> much<00:01:00.149> is<00:01:00.270> going<00:01:00.449> in<00:01:00.719> and

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
it up so I know how much is going in and

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.720 
it up so I know how much is going in and
then<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:01.649> other<00:01:01.800> side<00:01:02.039> of<00:01:02.160> this<00:01:02.250> black<00:01:02.520> tee

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
then the other side of this black tee

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.329 
then the other side of this black tee
here<00:01:03.090> runs<00:01:03.660> down<00:01:03.899> in<00:01:04.019> feeds<00:01:04.290> what<00:01:04.890> is<00:01:05.010> the<00:01:05.159> new

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
here runs down in feeds what is the new

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.539 
here runs down in feeds what is the new
bottom<00:01:05.790> port<00:01:06.060> for<00:01:06.720> the<00:01:06.900> for<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:07.680> DJ<00:01:08.010> air<00:01:08.250> for

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
bottom port for the for the DJ air for

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.820 
bottom port for the for the DJ air for
the<00:01:08.610> dodging<00:01:09.000> or<00:01:09.540> you<00:01:09.960> know<00:01:10.080> whatever<00:01:10.439> kind<00:01:10.740> of

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
the dodging or you know whatever kind of

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.679 
the dodging or you know whatever kind of
toolkit<00:01:11.490> you<00:01:11.580> want<00:01:11.700> to<00:01:11.760> call<00:01:11.880> it<00:01:12.060> and<00:01:12.240> what's

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
toolkit you want to call it and what's

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.990 
toolkit you want to call it and what's
happening<00:01:12.960> is<00:01:13.170> when<00:01:13.320> I<00:01:13.409> apply<00:01:13.680> pressure<00:01:14.010> it's

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
happening is when I apply pressure it's

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.880 
happening is when I apply pressure it's
leaking<00:01:15.390> on<00:01:15.509> the<00:01:15.600> inside<00:01:16.020> here<00:01:16.290> and<00:01:16.409> as<00:01:16.680> you

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
leaking on the inside here and as you

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.649 
leaking on the inside here and as you
can<00:01:16.979> see<00:01:17.040> right<00:01:17.369> there<00:01:17.430> right<00:01:18.210> we're<00:01:18.390> worried

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
can see right there right we're worried

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.660 
can see right there right we're worried
about<00:01:18.869> my<00:01:19.080> thumb<00:01:19.290> is<00:01:19.530> it<00:01:19.830> seems<00:01:20.430> like<00:01:20.549> where

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
about my thumb is it seems like where

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.090 
about my thumb is it seems like where
that<00:01:20.759> shaft<00:01:21.299> slides<00:01:21.810> up<00:01:21.990> and<00:01:22.080> down<00:01:22.229> I<00:01:22.650> got<00:01:23.070> a

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
that shaft slides up and down I got a

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.380 
that shaft slides up and down I got a
leak<00:01:23.340> right<00:01:23.369> there<00:01:23.580> I'll<00:01:23.909> show<00:01:24.150> you<00:01:24.210> I<00:01:24.360> got

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
leak right there I'll show you I got

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.560 
leak right there I'll show you I got
some<00:01:24.689> I<00:01:24.900> got<00:01:25.320> some<00:01:25.470> soapy<00:01:25.799> water<00:01:25.979> and<00:01:26.570> I'll

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
some I got some soapy water and I'll

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.010 
some I got some soapy water and I'll
show<00:01:27.900> you<00:01:27.930> where<00:01:28.680> it's<00:01:28.829> leaking<00:01:29.009> it<00:01:29.900> so<00:01:30.900> I've

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
show you where it's leaking it so I've

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.960 
show you where it's leaking it so I've
taken<00:01:31.259> a<00:01:31.500> squirts<00:01:32.280> through<00:01:32.369> this<00:01:32.610> down<00:01:32.790> in

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
taken a squirts through this down in

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.050 
taken a squirts through this down in
there<00:01:33.409> just<00:01:34.409> to<00:01:34.560> get<00:01:34.710> it<00:01:34.829> good<00:01:34.979> and<00:01:35.040> so<00:01:35.850> I<00:01:35.880> can

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
there just to get it good and so I can

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.730 
there just to get it good and so I can
show<00:01:36.210> you<00:01:36.270> what's<00:01:36.450> going<00:01:36.479> on<00:01:36.780> and<00:01:37.259> I<00:01:37.470> apply

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
show you what's going on and I apply

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.850 
show you what's going on and I apply
pressure<00:01:38.009> I<00:01:39.380> don't<00:01:40.380> know<00:01:40.470> if<00:01:40.530> you<00:01:40.619> can<00:01:40.740> hear

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
pressure I don't know if you can hear

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.580 
pressure I don't know if you can hear
that<00:01:40.979> but<00:01:41.479> then<00:01:42.479> we're<00:01:42.630> taking<00:01:42.810> and<00:01:43.320> I<00:01:43.380> just

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
that but then we're taking and I just

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.069 
that but then we're taking and I just
blow<00:01:43.710> your<00:01:43.860> big<00:01:44.040> old<00:01:44.189> boat<00:01:44.369> see<00:01:44.640> it's<00:01:45.600> it's<00:01:45.960> a

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
blow your big old boat see it's it's a

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:49.069 
blow your big old boat see it's it's a
big<00:01:46.229> old<00:01:46.380> boost<00:01:46.590> leaking<00:01:46.950> there<00:01:47.630> you<00:01:48.630> know<00:01:48.810> I

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
big old boost leaking there you know I

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.929 
big old boost leaking there you know I
don't<00:01:49.950> know<00:01:50.009> I<00:01:50.040> don't<00:01:50.189> know<00:01:50.340> why<00:01:50.549> it's<00:01:50.759> leaking

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
don't know I don't know why it's leaking

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.399 
don't know I don't know why it's leaking
I'm<00:01:51.240> guessing<00:01:51.630> there's<00:01:51.780> a<00:01:51.869> seal<00:01:52.079> in<00:01:52.290> there

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
I'm guessing there's a seal in there

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.200 
I'm guessing there's a seal in there
that<00:01:52.530> goes<00:01:52.649> around<00:01:52.799> that<00:01:52.920> shaft<00:01:53.250> and<00:01:53.549> it<00:01:54.000> just

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
that goes around that shaft and it just

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.810 
that goes around that shaft and it just
finally<00:01:54.450> gave<00:01:54.780> out<00:01:54.960> see<00:01:55.470> so<00:01:55.799> I<00:01:56.100> blow<00:01:56.670> you

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
finally gave out see so I blow you

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.149 
finally gave out see so I blow you
another<00:01:57.030> one<00:01:57.240> oh<00:01:58.579> there's<00:01:59.579> some<00:01:59.729> soap<00:01:59.969> money

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:01.159 
another one oh there's some soap money

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:02.389 
another one oh there's some soap money
anyway

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
anyway

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:05.240 
anyway
is<00:02:02.969> it's<00:02:03.479> coming<00:02:03.840> from<00:02:03.960> the<00:02:04.110> bottom<00:02:04.259> port<00:02:04.710> if<00:02:05.009> I

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
is it's coming from the bottom port if I

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.419 
is it's coming from the bottom port if I
take<00:02:05.520> in<00:02:05.729> by<00:02:06.299> taking<00:02:06.659> cut<00:02:06.899> air<00:02:07.140> off<00:02:07.320> I<00:02:07.619> squeeze

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
take in by taking cut air off I squeeze

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.289 
take in by taking cut air off I squeeze
that<00:02:08.610> bottom<00:02:08.910> port<00:02:09.149> shut

00:02:11.289 --> 00:02:11.299 
that bottom port shut

00:02:11.299 --> 00:02:15.619 
that bottom port shut
it's<00:02:12.299> not<00:02:12.510> leaking<00:02:12.870> really<00:02:14.360> without<00:02:15.360> taking

00:02:15.619 --> 00:02:15.629 
it's not leaking really without taking

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:19.069 
it's not leaking really without taking
over<00:02:15.780> the<00:02:15.870> back<00:02:15.989> up<00:02:17.390> and<00:02:18.390> start<00:02:18.629> leaking<00:02:18.780> and

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:19.079 
over the back up and start leaking and

00:02:19.079 --> 00:02:22.309 
over the back up and start leaking and
there<00:02:19.170> comes<00:02:19.349> another<00:02:19.409> bowl<00:02:19.739> see<00:02:20.150> so<00:02:21.319> it's

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319 
there comes another bowl see so it's

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:23.720 
there comes another bowl see so it's
come<00:02:22.530> from<00:02:22.620> the<00:02:22.739> bottom<00:02:23.040> port<00:02:23.280> it<00:02:23.430> seems<00:02:23.610> like

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
come from the bottom port it seems like

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:24.800 
come from the bottom port it seems like
on<00:02:23.849> the<00:02:23.909> bottom<00:02:24.060> side<00:02:24.269> it<00:02:24.420> seems<00:02:24.569> like<00:02:24.750> the

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
on the bottom side it seems like the

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.649 
on the bottom side it seems like the
diaphragms<00:02:25.290> good<00:02:25.939> but<00:02:26.939> on<00:02:27.060> the<00:02:27.239> bottom<00:02:27.390> side

00:02:27.649 --> 00:02:27.659 
diaphragms good but on the bottom side

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:29.809 
diaphragms good but on the bottom side
of<00:02:27.720> that<00:02:27.840> diaphragm<00:02:28.379> where<00:02:29.040> that<00:02:29.250> shaft<00:02:29.519> rides

00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:29.819 
of that diaphragm where that shaft rides

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:32.509 
of that diaphragm where that shaft rides
through<00:02:30.150> I'm<00:02:30.599> guessing<00:02:31.019> there's<00:02:31.170> a<00:02:31.230> seal<00:02:31.519> and

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:32.519 
through I'm guessing there's a seal and

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:34.339 
through I'm guessing there's a seal and
of<00:02:32.909> course<00:02:33.150> as<00:02:33.239> you<00:02:33.360> can<00:02:33.420> see<00:02:33.659> it's<00:02:34.049> not<00:02:34.200> like

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:34.349 
of course as you can see it's not like

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:35.360 
of course as you can see it's not like
it's<00:02:34.470> being<00:02:34.590> pushed<00:02:34.799> open<00:02:35.129> and<00:02:35.250> booth

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
it's being pushed open and booth

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.009 
it's being pushed open and booth
pressures<00:02:35.670> coming<00:02:35.879> through<00:02:36.180> it's<00:02:36.329> actually<00:02:36.989> a

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:37.019 
pressures coming through it's actually a

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:40.220 
pressures coming through it's actually a
problem<00:02:37.319> up<00:02:38.220> top<00:02:38.489> here<00:02:38.730> I<00:02:38.940> just<00:02:39.629> looking<00:02:40.079> for

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
problem up top here I just looking for

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:41.990 
problem up top here I just looking for
y'all's<00:02:40.379> input<00:02:40.769> is<00:02:41.129> this<00:02:41.310> normal<00:02:41.730> do<00:02:41.849> y'all

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
y'all's input is this normal do y'all

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.490 
y'all's input is this normal do y'all
see<00:02:42.269> this<00:02:42.420> all<00:02:42.599> the<00:02:42.689> times<00:02:42.930> there's<00:02:43.260> another

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
see this all the times there's another

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.059 
see this all the times there's another
bubble<00:02:43.739> so<00:02:44.129> I<00:02:44.280> just<00:02:44.459> applied<00:02:44.730> pressure<00:02:44.970> again

00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:46.069 
bubble so I just applied pressure again

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:48.979 
bubble so I just applied pressure again
as<00:02:47.069> you<00:02:47.310> can<00:02:47.459> see<00:02:47.700> by<00:02:48.150> the<00:02:48.209> boost<00:02:48.480> gauge<00:02:48.629> I<00:02:48.810> let

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:48.989 
as you can see by the boost gauge I let

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:51.110 
as you can see by the boost gauge I let
off<00:02:49.170> it'll<00:02:49.739> bleed<00:02:49.920> down<00:02:50.190> you<00:02:50.849> can<00:02:50.940> see<00:02:51.030> the

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
off it'll bleed down you can see the

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.710 
off it'll bleed down you can see the
boost<00:02:51.299> gauge<00:02:51.450> in<00:02:51.599> the<00:02:51.690> background<00:02:53.599> fire<00:02:54.599> it

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
boost gauge in the background fire it

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.759 
boost gauge in the background fire it
back<00:02:54.930> up<00:02:55.200> and<00:02:55.470> it<00:02:56.190> just<00:02:56.400> starts<00:02:56.579> leaking<00:02:56.760> again

00:02:57.759 --> 00:02:57.769 
back up and it just starts leaking again

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:01.129 
back up and it just starts leaking again
you<00:02:58.769> can<00:02:58.889> hear<00:02:59.010> that<00:02:59.209> then<00:03:00.209> you<00:03:00.329> can<00:03:00.569> you<00:03:00.959> can

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:01.139 
you can hear that then you can you can

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:03.920 
you can hear that then you can you can
move<00:03:01.260> this<00:03:01.409> valve<00:03:01.620> side<00:03:01.859> to<00:03:02.010> side<00:03:02.359> see<00:03:03.359> I<00:03:03.599> made

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
move this valve side to side see I made

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:07.190 
move this valve side to side see I made
it<00:03:04.049> louder<00:03:04.609> and<00:03:05.609> go<00:03:05.879> the<00:03:06.000> other<00:03:06.090> way<00:03:06.180> and<00:03:06.450> that

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
it louder and go the other way and that

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.559 
it louder and go the other way and that
made<00:03:07.319> it<00:03:07.349> be<00:03:07.500> quieter<00:03:08.269> but<00:03:09.269> it's<00:03:09.420> still

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:09.569 
made it be quieter but it's still

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:12.050 
made it be quieter but it's still
leaking<00:03:09.780> but<00:03:10.290> it's<00:03:10.409> just<00:03:10.470> quieter<00:03:10.950> so<00:03:11.159> just

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
leaking but it's just quieter so just

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:13.250 
leaking but it's just quieter so just
looking<00:03:12.269> for<00:03:12.389> your<00:03:12.480> take<00:03:12.659> on<00:03:12.690> this

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
looking for your take on this

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.470 
looking for your take on this
did<00:03:13.680> I<00:03:13.799> dodge<00:03:14.280> might<00:03:14.549> apply<00:03:14.730> a<00:03:14.790> blow-off<00:03:15.120> valve

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
did I dodge might apply a blow-off valve

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:16.789 
did I dodge might apply a blow-off valve
and<00:03:15.660> need<00:03:15.750> to<00:03:15.840> get<00:03:15.900> a<00:03:15.989> new<00:03:16.109> one<00:03:16.260> or<00:03:16.379> not<00:03:16.530> I

00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:16.799 
and need to get a new one or not I

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:19.370 
and need to get a new one or not I
appreciate
