00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:10.459
 this is the day that is the magic day was 

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:16.550
 the cuchi cuchi day I previously took 

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:21.370
 the garlic and April and April is 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:24.180
 wet was wet in the container 

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:25.640
 it was hot 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.640
 and 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:32.610
 pretty hot these are the garlics already 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:37.430
 I put them here many of the garlic 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:41.210
 they are wet others are dry there were already 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:41.210
 garlic processing 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:47.910
 for example look at this let's open 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:49.950
 this 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:53.190
 remember that you still need here 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.410
 rest a week yes but here is already 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.540
 The transformation 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:59.770
 this is these are the ones that were down 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:01.900
 a mere down 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:03.930
 remember that we put it in wilde or 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:07.020
 only 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:09.350
 and they are wet they are releasing the juice 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:14.220
 there you can see it 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:18.420
 even the finger and there are other garlics that 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:21.810
 they are completely wet this 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:26.070
 example this garlic is completely 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:30.360
 wet but this is already transformed 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:35.190
 I did not get in like this and it's transformed and still 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:36.630
 the drying is drying but as 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:39.930
 I 'll repeat them again 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:43.820
 there are others that are completely dry 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:46.080
 like this one that is is dry 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:49.860
 completely dry dehydrated 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:54.140
 totally but already inside it is 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:57.400
 black for example let me be one 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.400
 I'm going to hit one 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:04.620
 to be seen 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:04.620
 and look 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:12.910
 here is here this nap is here 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:15.340
 dry is dry 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:17.880
 quite dry and I feel that it is missing 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.500
 a little bit of truth 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:22.740
 or 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:24.630
 the week there are those below to put them 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:27.210
 above and those from top to bottom you have to 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:30.270
 make a movement of the garlic here 

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:36.440
 this lake already transformed to black 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:36.440
 if it is dry it is hard it is taffy 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:42.390
 do not know down 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:42.390
 do not know down 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:48.840
 it's like it's a raisin 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:53.170
 the good state 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:57.990
 but if I feel that on the way to that 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:03:00.800
 those above put them down a week 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:00.800
 why 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:08.959
 they rotate wet evenly all the 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.959
 years and do not have some dry like this 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:17.920
 well then simply in the future 

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:19.510
 black bush who consumes them is not a 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:22.680
 chulada I recommend it from the heart 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:22.680
 pass the good pagÃ¡
