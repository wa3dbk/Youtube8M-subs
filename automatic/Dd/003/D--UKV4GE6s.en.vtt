00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:05.389
 hello friends today we are going to 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.389
 to learn 

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:11.760
 to install old pressures of flash 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:14.190
 in the videos or on the cell phone first thing 

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:16.459
 what we have to do is go to the panel 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.459
 configuration 

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:23.429
 and select the security window 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:27.030
 as you can see with your device 

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:29.130
 Android will find an option 

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:31.230
 to allow unknown origins 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.780
 and verify the applications as much 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.870
 It is likely that this is without 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.480
 select so we should 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:42.190
 select it 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:45.340
 then do this quietly 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:50.010
 we can visit the page one page 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:50.010
 online games like it could be 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.250
 all of this point 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:09.520
 and if you do not deliver this message or another 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.520
 what we have to do is 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:13.240
 click on the button 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:19.440
 and in this article they teach us to 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:28.110
 and install flash applications 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.720
 what is basically the same thing that I 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.890
 I'm showing in the video and if it 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.530
 fix 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:38.080
 in the part in step 2 there are two 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:43.540
 versions this is the version for 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:47.080
 android 4 and for android 2 and 3 as the 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:48.850
 samsung galaxy note that I have deals with 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:53.490
 android 4 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:53.490
 I will download directly from here 

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:58.570
 and I accept even though he is telling me 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:00.220
 that can damage my computer because in 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:02.170
 what I am doing is 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:05.330
 download an old version of android 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:08.540
 that he no longer uses it as a practice 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:09.770
 if you do not accept it natively android 

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:12.790
 4 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:12.790
 then boyacÃ¡ 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:17.950
 I downloaded 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:19.060
 so I can not open the file what 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.980
 it is logical 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:23.400
 so I'm going to go to the explorer later 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.400
 of files 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.480
 but 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:38.600
 I install completely in the installation 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:49.489
 of the flash version for android 4 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:04.940
 once installed we should see the 

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:06.410
 flash game on the cell phone so let's go 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:08.620
 to check again let's go to 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:08.620
 chrome 

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:19.410
 the dress up games again where not 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:21.940
 we could see the game 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:24.310
 we go 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:27.130
 to try to play 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:31.160
 if everything went well we should be able to see 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:34.310
 the game if we did not do it right 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:36.380
 is going to throw the same message and I think that 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:39.100
 look closely at this I just opened 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:41.120
 the page with 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:43.519
 the chrome 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:45.560
 after having installed the application and 

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:48.280
 I keep showing the same message this 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:52.000
 this message 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:54.430
 happens because chrome does not accept 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.730
 even the old versions 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:04:00.969
 of flash player for android so what 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:03.370
 What we should do is find another 

00:04:00.969 --> 00:04:05.790
 browser in this case 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:05.790
 firefox 

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:11.600
 and write dress up games 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:22.889
 org point for example 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:22.889
 it can be any game page 

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:32.250
 and now if we should be able to see the game 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:32.250
 yes that attention 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:41.220
 everything normal here we close the video for 

00:04:38.409 --> 00:04:44.310
 can play and says 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:46.620
 we want to click on that link to 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:47.780
 activate the plugin we are not seeing 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:52.340
 the same message 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:57.699
 so let's see what happens 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:05:01.900
 we activate it and we are already able to play 

00:04:57.699 --> 00:05:01.900
 and watch the flash games 

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:07.820
 so is to enjoy 

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:09.880
 Dress up games or any other 

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:12.660
 that this work 

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:12.660
 Thank you
