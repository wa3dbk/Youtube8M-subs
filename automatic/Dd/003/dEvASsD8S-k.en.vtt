April<00:03:01.780> I<00:03:01.930> said<00:03:02.230> that<00:03:02.380> on<00:03:02.500> the<00:03:02.530> product<00:03:02.890> page

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
April I said that on the product page

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.680 
April I said that on the product page
and<00:03:03.220> that's<00:03:03.340> probably<00:03:03.610> going<00:03:04.120> to<00:03:04.180> be<00:03:04.240> true

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
and that's probably going to be true

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:06.750 
and that's probably going to be true
even<00:03:05.110> though<00:03:05.380> we<00:03:05.500> reach<00:03:05.680> the<00:03:05.890> goal<00:03:06.040> so<00:03:06.310> quickly

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 
even though we reach the goal so quickly

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.000 
even though we reach the goal so quickly
it<00:03:07.390> just<00:03:07.570> takes<00:03:07.780> a<00:03:07.990> long<00:03:08.170> time<00:03:08.200> getting

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
it just takes a long time getting

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:11.220 
it just takes a long time getting
through<00:03:09.220> contracts<00:03:09.880> and<00:03:10.180> legal<00:03:10.390> stuff<00:03:10.900> and

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
production schedules real long and I

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:18.210 
production schedules real long and I
can't<00:03:16.780> really<00:03:16.870> control<00:03:17.290> that<00:03:17.410> so<00:03:17.860> I'm<00:03:18.040> just

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
can't really control that so I'm just

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:20.280 
can't really control that so I'm just
waiting<00:03:18.640> for<00:03:19.180> them<00:03:19.300> at<00:03:19.360> this<00:03:19.600> point<00:03:19.870> and<00:03:20.200> you
