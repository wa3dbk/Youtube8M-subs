00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:16.229
 Doing so is very easy to eat 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:19.350
 Simply we face, after all, 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:21.420
 and tell us we are eating out 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.369
 emotional reasons because we have stress 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.049

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.700

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.710
 grades in school have a bad one 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.119
 have grades in the university because we do not 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.329
 come to terms with our lives 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:38.119
 That's why we eat people 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:40.770
 Of course this is total bullshit 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:43.710

 Energy density yes with the highest 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:08.729

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:14.230
 the most per volume is yes 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:17.350
 salty greasy sugar refined 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:19.450
 sugar chocolate such things you will 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:22.390
 dir da rainha because the body namely 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:24.010

 densest source I have you there 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:35.709
 that's quite easy and that's why 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:38.110
 is it because of your body 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:39.760
 Systematically too little energy exists and 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:44.950
 Although energy in the form of carbohydrates 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:46.660
 in healthy form ripe fruits cereal 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:49.000
 legumes potatoes etc 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:51.430
 yes, if you give your body too little of it 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:57.370
 there is finally over there sometime times 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:03:01.410
 yes, there are such people as somebody 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:03.910
 It had its own essans 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:04.600
 emotional eating that's bullshit that 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:06.610
 is bullshit 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:09.489
 that's exactly how it turns out 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:13.570
 and says sax emotional breathing i breathe 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:17.220
 because i'm having stress with mine 

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:20.950
 girlfriend I start to breathe 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:23.320
 I'll tell you what to do on the train 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:25.030
 race fast and with a kilometer 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:27.310
 hear as fast as you can that is 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:29.680
 race kilometer hurts so fast 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:31.540
 that it hurts right and then stop 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:35.560
 to run and sit down and 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:38.000
 watch what happened to you 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.380
 yaez take breath because your case 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.940
 body has more oxygen to blame 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:43.430
 oxygen needs and compensate 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:45.080
 must be exactly the same effect with the 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:45.950
 there is too little binoculars in the body 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:47.810
 energy given 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:49.340
 and zack bumm everything comes back again 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:52.850
 And it has to be somehow the body bread 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:56.200
 that somehow pure that is completely 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:59.270
 that's easy 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:01.070
 you do not drink for a day 

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:02.780
 Just have a drink for a day 

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:05.090
 nothing will happen if you do that 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:06.950
 next water hole you see shit whether 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:08.960

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:20.000
 Emotional eating people is bullshit that 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:22.370
 is as bullshit as it is emotional 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.700
 that's just as much as the boys breathe 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:27.740
 I can only drink emotionally 

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:29.600

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:31.430
