if you just select this you can bend the
front<00:03:41.459> part<00:03:42.709> then<00:03:43.709> the

thing<00:03:52.720> if<00:03:53.720> some<00:03:53.930> of<00:03:54.019> the<00:03:54.079> bones<00:03:54.290> are<00:03:54.590> a<00:03:54.620> bit

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:54.829 
thing if some of the bones are a bit

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:56.979 
thing if some of the bones are a bit
wonky<00:03:55.519> at<00:03:55.790> the<00:03:55.909> moment<00:03:56.239> I'm<00:03:56.360> also<00:03:56.599> gonna<00:03:56.780> try

00:03:56.979 --> 00:03:56.989 
wonky at the moment I'm also gonna try

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:04.360 
wonky at the moment I'm also gonna try
and<00:03:57.140> fix<00:03:57.290> that<00:04:01.269> I'm<00:04:02.269> bending<00:04:02.659> the<00:04:02.780> wrong<00:04:03.370> area

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:04.370 
and fix that I'm bending the wrong area

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:06.940 
and fix that I'm bending the wrong area
but<00:04:04.640> as<00:04:04.849> you<00:04:05.000> can<00:04:05.150> see<00:04:05.329> you<00:04:05.480> can<00:04:05.690> adjust<00:04:06.470> the

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:06.950 
but as you can see you can adjust the

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:09.819 
but as you can see you can adjust the
front<00:04:07.310> part<00:04:07.489> of<00:04:07.549> the<00:04:07.670> cat<00:04:07.879> with<00:04:08.120> the<00:04:08.870> middle

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:09.829 
front part of the cat with the middle

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:14.229 
front part of the cat with the middle
bone<00:04:11.170> so<00:04:12.170> the<00:04:12.409> spine<00:04:12.799> is<00:04:13.010> customizable<00:04:13.640> and

00:04:14.229 --> 00:04:14.239 
bone so the spine is customizable and

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:17.259 
bone so the spine is customizable and
the<00:04:15.019> part<00:04:15.260> that<00:04:15.349> I<00:04:15.799> really<00:04:16.400> liked<00:04:16.669> about<00:04:16.970> this

00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:17.269 
the part that I really liked about this

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:19.120 
the part that I really liked about this
that<00:04:17.539> I<00:04:17.570> tried<00:04:17.959> to<00:04:18.049> spend<00:04:18.229> a<00:04:18.289> long<00:04:18.440> time<00:04:18.470> on<00:04:18.650> is

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:19.130 
that I tried to spend a long time on is

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:22.390 
that I tried to spend a long time on is
the<00:04:19.850> tail<00:04:20.180> the<00:04:20.479> tail<00:04:20.510> if<00:04:20.959> you<00:04:21.079> can't<00:04:21.289> tell<00:04:21.650> has

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 
the tail the tail if you can't tell has

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.430 
the tail the tail if you can't tell has
a<00:04:22.850> ton<00:04:23.240> of<00:04:23.270> bones<00:04:23.570> a<00:04:23.720> bone<00:04:23.870> for<00:04:24.020> every<00:04:24.229> pixel

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:24.440 
a ton of bones a bone for every pixel

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:27.969 
a ton of bones a bone for every pixel
actually<00:04:25.840> on<00:04:26.840> the<00:04:27.020> tail<00:04:27.199> so<00:04:27.410> when<00:04:27.560> you<00:04:27.650> select

00:04:27.969 --> 00:04:27.979 
actually on the tail so when you select

00:04:27.979 --> 00:04:33.700 
actually on the tail so when you select
this<00:04:28.570> the<00:04:29.800> tail<00:04:30.800> will<00:04:31.190> have<00:04:31.400> a<00:04:32.229> very<00:04:33.229> realistic

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:33.710 
this the tail will have a very realistic

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:36.670 
this the tail will have a very realistic
sort<00:04:34.580> of<00:04:34.729> curling<00:04:35.660> and<00:04:35.840> bending<00:04:36.260> and<00:04:36.320> all<00:04:36.470> that

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:36.680 
sort of curling and bending and all that

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:39.460 
sort of curling and bending and all that
so<00:04:37.430> you<00:04:37.940> could<00:04:38.090> just<00:04:38.300> have<00:04:38.660> it<00:04:38.690> like<00:04:38.810> drag<00:04:39.260> when

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:39.470 
so you could just have it like drag when

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:42.719 
so you could just have it like drag when
it<00:04:39.590> walks<00:04:39.830> or<00:04:40.039> something<00:04:40.430> or<00:04:41.020> when<00:04:42.020> it<00:04:42.199> like

00:04:42.719 --> 00:04:42.729 
it walks or something or when it like

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:44.710

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:10.220 
head when you render it so you don't

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:13.240 
head when you render it so you don't
have<00:05:10.310> to<00:05:10.370> worry<00:05:10.520> about<00:05:10.760> that<00:05:10.970> they<00:05:11.210> won't<00:05:12.250> like

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:14.620 
have to worry about that they won't like
see<00:05:13.400> it<00:05:13.520> looks<00:05:13.760> like<00:05:13.910> it's<00:05:14.060> going<00:05:14.300> out<00:05:14.389> but<00:05:14.539> if

about that
um<00:05:21.380> I<00:05:22.300> just<00:05:23.300> delete<00:05:23.479> this<00:05:24.010> reset<00:05:25.010> these<00:05:25.190> back

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:31.800 

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:35.360 

what<00:05:32.699> are<00:05:32.759> these<00:05:32.849> called<00:05:33.030> um<00:05:33.949> float<00:05:34.949> sliders

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:35.370 
what are these called um float sliders

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:39.650 
what are these called um float sliders
so<00:05:35.819> you<00:05:35.879> can<00:05:36.270> just<00:05:36.650> select<00:05:37.650> these<00:05:38.009> and<00:05:38.789> I've

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:02.460 
any of these little vector field things

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:04.580 
any of these little vector field things
these<00:06:02.879> little<00:06:03.090> 2d<00:06:03.330> fields<00:06:03.720> to<00:06:04.050> go<00:06:04.229> back<00:06:04.409> and

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:04.590 
these little 2d fields to go back and

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:07.189 
these little 2d fields to go back and
I'll<00:06:04.650> make<00:06:04.800> it<00:06:04.830> yourself<00:06:05.009> to<00:06:05.370> zero<00:06:05.720> the<00:06:06.720> open

00:06:07.189 --> 00:06:07.199 
I'll make it yourself to zero the open

00:06:07.199 --> 00:06:09.680 
I'll make it yourself to zero the open
and<00:06:07.349> close<00:06:07.620> that<00:06:08.220> just<00:06:08.490> shows<00:06:09.210> whether<00:06:09.449> you

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:09.690 
and close that just shows whether you

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:12.999 
and close that just shows whether you
have<00:06:09.870> the<00:06:10.080> mouth<00:06:10.849> how<00:06:11.849> far<00:06:12.090> you<00:06:12.240> want<00:06:12.360> it<00:06:12.509> to

00:06:12.999 --> 00:06:13.009 
have the mouth how far you want it to

00:06:13.009 --> 00:06:16.219 
have the mouth how far you want it to
open<00:06:14.009> till<00:06:14.460> close<00:06:15.020> that's<00:06:16.020> a<00:06:16.110> bit

00:06:16.219 --> 00:06:16.229 
open till close that's a bit

00:06:16.229 --> 00:06:18.469 
open till close that's a bit
self-explanatory<00:06:16.680> and<00:06:17.190> then<00:06:17.490> the<00:06:17.610> teeth<00:06:17.849> that

00:06:18.469 --> 00:06:18.479 
self-explanatory and then the teeth that

00:06:18.479 --> 00:06:21.499 
self-explanatory and then the teeth that
will<00:06:18.690> show<00:06:19.470> that<00:06:20.060> changes<00:06:21.060> how<00:06:21.180> much<00:06:21.330> of<00:06:21.449> the

00:06:21.499 --> 00:06:21.509 
will show that changes how much of the

00:06:21.509 --> 00:06:24.709 
will show that changes how much of the
teeth<00:06:21.659> are<00:06:21.810> visible<00:06:22.729> so<00:06:23.729> you<00:06:24.150> could<00:06:24.270> just<00:06:24.300> have

00:06:24.709 --> 00:06:24.719 
teeth are visible so you could just have

00:06:24.719 --> 00:06:28.309 
teeth are visible so you could just have
the<00:06:24.750> teeth<00:06:25.020> close<00:06:25.349> them<00:06:25.530> like<00:06:25.560> this<00:06:26.270> so<00:06:27.319> that

00:06:28.309 --> 00:06:28.319 
the teeth close them like this so that

00:06:28.319 --> 00:06:31.820 
the teeth close them like this so that
again<00:06:29.419> see<00:06:30.419> he<00:06:30.780> has<00:06:30.870> no<00:06:31.050> teeth<00:06:31.229> he<00:06:31.500> is<00:06:31.590> an<00:06:31.680> old

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:31.830 
again see he has no teeth he is an old

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:41.089 
again see he has no teeth he is an old
man<00:06:35.719> no<00:06:36.719> teeth<00:06:36.960> elderly<00:06:38.449> video<00:06:39.449> today<00:06:39.810> I<00:06:40.560> also
