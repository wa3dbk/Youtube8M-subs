mirror on this one so you see a little

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:08.420 
mirror on this one so you see a little
flash<00:03:06.840> that's<00:03:07.170> what<00:03:07.290> it<00:03:07.380> is<00:03:07.500> I'm<00:03:08.190> going<00:03:08.370> to

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
flash that's what it is I'm going to

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:15.860 
flash that's what it is I'm going to
kind<00:03:08.700> of<00:03:08.790> try<00:03:09.060> to<00:03:10.820> draw<00:03:11.820> you<00:03:12.120> know<00:03:12.270> how<00:03:14.870> zombies
