00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
and Finn's right here one bad thing

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.060 
and Finn's right here one bad thing
about<00:00:58.620> it<00:00:58.800> is<00:00:58.920> that<00:00:59.160> there's<00:00:59.789> so<00:01:00.000> many<00:01:00.180> stakes

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:01.070 
about it is that there's so many stakes

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:03.979 
about it is that there's so many stakes
with<00:01:02.070> it<00:01:02.219> it<00:01:02.760> takes<00:01:02.969> a<00:01:03.090> little<00:01:03.239> bit<00:01:03.420> of<00:01:03.480> time<00:01:03.809> to

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
with it it takes a little bit of time to

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.630 
with it it takes a little bit of time to
set<00:01:04.290> up<00:01:05.090> but<00:01:06.090> it's<00:01:06.240> got<00:01:06.390> two<00:01:06.900> doors<00:01:07.460> with<00:01:08.460> all

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
set up but it's got two doors with all

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.660 
set up but it's got two doors with all
that<00:01:08.850> space<00:01:09.560> and<00:01:10.560> one<00:01:11.010> cool<00:01:11.250> thing<00:01:11.430> about<00:01:11.520> it

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
that space and one cool thing about it

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.370 
that space and one cool thing about it
is<00:01:11.820> it<00:01:12.060> rolls<00:01:12.299> up<00:01:12.479> into<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:12.840> small<00:01:13.200> little

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
is it rolls up into the small little

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:19.760
