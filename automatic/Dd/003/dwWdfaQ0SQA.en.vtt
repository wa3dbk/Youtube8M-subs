ROM<00:00:30.390> review<00:00:30.810> but<00:00:31.500> then<00:00:31.650> I<00:00:31.710> installed<00:00:32.189> SIA

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
ROM review but then I installed SIA

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.049 
ROM review but then I installed SIA
kernel<00:00:33.000> and<00:00:33.410> you<00:00:34.410> know<00:00:34.520> without<00:00:35.520> SIA

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
kernel and you know without SIA

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.959 
kernel and you know without SIA
it<00:00:36.450> comes<00:00:37.110> with<00:00:37.320> djibouti<00:00:38.010> no<00:00:38.280> which<00:00:38.640> you<00:00:38.790> can

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
it comes with djibouti no which you can

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:40.250 
it comes with djibouti no which you can
overclock<00:00:39.329> with<00:00:39.660> this<00:00:39.809> one<00:00:39.989> you<00:00:40.110> can

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
overclock with this one you can

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.650 
overclock with this one you can

overview<00:00:57.510> uh<00:00:57.800> about<00:00:58.800> a<00:00:58.859> month<00:00:58.920> ago<00:00:59.190> but<00:00:59.430> a<00:00:59.609> lot

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
overview uh about a month ago but a lot

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.900 
overview uh about a month ago but a lot
of<00:01:00.180> things<00:01:00.600> have<00:01:00.809> gotten<00:01:01.199> even<00:01:01.350> better<00:01:01.910> the

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
of things have gotten even better the

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.630 
of things have gotten even better the
developer<00:01:03.359> show<00:01:03.780> stock<00:01:04.080> has<00:01:04.350> made<00:01:05.189> this<00:01:05.400> ROM

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
developer show stock has made this ROM

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.660 
developer show stock has made this ROM
even<00:01:06.240> Stabler<00:01:07.049> and<00:01:07.200> with<00:01:07.770> SIA<00:01:08.130> kernel<00:01:08.580> it's

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
even Stabler and with SIA kernel it's

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.090 
even Stabler and with SIA kernel it's
running<00:01:09.090> really<00:01:09.479> nice<00:01:09.830> you<00:01:10.830> got<00:01:10.979> the

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
running really nice you got the

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.300 
running really nice you got the
transparent<00:01:11.760> multi<00:01:12.630> window<00:01:13.100> enabled<00:01:14.100> for<00:01:14.280> all

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
transparent multi window enabled for all

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.899 
transparent multi window enabled for all
apps<00:01:14.700> here<00:01:15.320> it<00:01:16.320> works<00:01:16.409> flawless<00:01:17.009> I<00:01:17.250> think<00:01:17.790> it's

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
apps here it works flawless I think it's

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.480 
apps here it works flawless I think it's
probably<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:18.299> best<00:01:18.659> rom<00:01:18.990> if<00:01:19.860> you<00:01:20.040> you<00:01:20.250> see<00:01:20.280> a

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
probably the best rom if you you see a

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.539 
probably the best rom if you you see a
kernel<00:01:20.880> definitely<00:01:21.420> and<00:01:22.350> there<00:01:22.740> we<00:01:22.890> go

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
kernel definitely and there we go

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.820 
kernel definitely and there we go
and<00:01:24.180> I've<00:01:24.509> gotta<00:01:24.750> actually<00:01:24.960> overclocked<00:01:25.650> and

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
and I've gotta actually overclocked and

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.090 
and I've gotta actually overclocked and
this<00:01:26.369> makes<00:01:26.580> it<00:01:26.759> work<00:01:27.180> even<00:01:27.420> better<00:01:28.080> let<00:01:29.040> me

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
this makes it work even better let me

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.010 
this makes it work even better let me
show<00:01:29.250> you<00:01:29.340> my<00:01:29.460> overclock<00:01:29.939> settings<00:01:30.420> it

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
show you my overclock settings it

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.510 
show you my overclock settings it
actually<00:01:31.290> comes<00:01:31.439> with<00:01:31.530> s<00:01:31.799> tweaks<00:01:32.100> apps<00:01:32.340> you

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
actually comes with s tweaks apps you

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.330 
actually comes with s tweaks apps you
don't<00:01:32.670> have<00:01:32.790> to<00:01:32.939> install<00:01:33.270> setcpu<00:01:33.750> I<00:01:34.229> just<00:01:35.130> did

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
don't have to install setcpu I just did

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.410 
don't have to install setcpu I just did
that<00:01:35.990> before<00:01:36.990> installing<00:01:37.290> SIA<00:01:37.590> kernel<00:01:38.210> with<00:01:39.210> s

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
that before installing SIA kernel with s

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.910 
that before installing SIA kernel with s
tweaks<00:01:39.750> you<00:01:39.930> should<00:01:40.140> be<00:01:40.229> able<00:01:40.320> to<00:01:40.439> overclock

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
tweaks you should be able to overclock

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.120 
tweaks you should be able to overclock
it<00:01:41.220> easily<00:01:41.610> to<00:01:42.119> 1.6<00:01:43.079> up<00:01:43.409> to<00:01:43.590> one<00:01:43.710> point<00:01:43.860> 6

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
it easily to 1.6 up to one point 6

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.030 
it easily to 1.6 up to one point 6
gigahertz<00:01:44.369> go<00:01:45.119> ahead<00:01:45.299> and<00:01:45.450> do<00:01:45.600> try<00:01:45.950> running<00:01:46.950> at

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
gigahertz go ahead and do try running at

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.420 
gigahertz go ahead and do try running at
1.6<00:01:47.720> um<00:01:48.720> I'm<00:01:49.140> actually<00:01:49.350> getting<00:01:49.890> pretty<00:01:50.369> good

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
1.6 um I'm actually getting pretty good

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.410 
1.6 um I'm actually getting pretty good
battery<00:01:50.970> life<00:01:51.119> even<00:01:51.329> at<00:01:51.689> 1.6<00:01:52.350> and<00:01:53.180> that's<00:01:54.180> kind

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
battery life even at 1.6 and that's kind

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.020 
battery life even at 1.6 and that's kind
of<00:01:54.509> cool<00:01:54.890> you<00:01:55.890> can<00:01:56.040> see<00:01:56.219> my<00:01:56.369> maximum<00:01:56.820> frequency

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
of cool you can see my maximum frequency

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.780 
of cool you can see my maximum frequency
I've<00:01:57.509> set<00:01:57.719> it<00:01:57.750> to<00:01:57.869> 1.6<00:01:58.640> gigahertz<00:01:59.640> or

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:00.790 
I've set it to 1.6 gigahertz or

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:02.910 
I've set it to 1.6 gigahertz or
yeah<00:02:01.210> that<00:02:01.420> and<00:02:01.720> also<00:02:02.320> you<00:02:02.410> can<00:02:02.530> set<00:02:02.770> it<00:02:02.890> a

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:02.920 
yeah that and also you can set it a

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.760 
yeah that and also you can set it a
little<00:02:03.070> bit<00:02:03.220> lower<00:02:03.400> 1.5<00:02:04.240> um<00:02:04.660> if<00:02:05.020> it's<00:02:05.230> reboots

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:05.770 
little bit lower 1.5 um if it's reboots

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:07.890 
little bit lower 1.5 um if it's reboots
or<00:02:05.920> if<00:02:06.040> it's<00:02:06.190> not<00:02:06.370> stable<00:02:06.610> it<00:02:06.940> just<00:02:07.360> depends<00:02:07.810> on

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:07.900 
or if it's not stable it just depends on

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:09.900 
or if it's not stable it just depends on
the<00:02:08.110> phone<00:02:08.320> you<00:02:08.530> have<00:02:08.740> every<00:02:09.399> CPU<00:02:09.850> is

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:09.910 
the phone you have every CPU is

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:12.420 
the phone you have every CPU is
different<00:02:10.390> because<00:02:10.570> is<00:02:11.230> you<00:02:11.620> know<00:02:11.800> every<00:02:12.010> CPU

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
different because is you know every CPU

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.140 
different because is you know every CPU
is<00:02:12.580> built<00:02:13.110> from<00:02:14.110> sand<00:02:14.610> silicon<00:02:15.610> is<00:02:15.820> made<00:02:16.000> from

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
sand which can vary you know according

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.250 
sand which can vary you know according
to<00:02:19.960> the<00:02:20.530> chip<00:02:20.770> you<00:02:20.920> have<00:02:20.950> so<00:02:21.610> it's<00:02:21.730> just<00:02:21.940> a<00:02:22.260> pick

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
to the chip you have so it's just a pick

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.740 
to the chip you have so it's just a pick
out<00:02:23.410> of<00:02:23.440> the<00:02:23.680> chocolate<00:02:24.340> box<00:02:24.490> or<00:02:25.300> whatever

anyway a CPU voltage I don't I wouldn't

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:31.740 
anyway a CPU voltage I don't I wouldn't
really<00:02:29.080> mess<00:02:29.350> with<00:02:29.380> that<00:02:29.740> CPU<00:02:30.550> tuning<00:02:30.940> if<00:02:31.660> you

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
really mess with that CPU tuning if you

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.660 
really mess with that CPU tuning if you
really<00:02:31.930> want<00:02:32.110> to<00:02:32.170> mess<00:02:32.320> with<00:02:32.500> it<00:02:32.560> you<00:02:32.950> can<00:02:33.220> but

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
really want to mess with it you can but

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:35.940 
really want to mess with it you can but
I<00:02:33.790> wouldn't<00:02:34.330> mess<00:02:34.510> with<00:02:34.540> much<00:02:34.960> of<00:02:35.140> this<00:02:35.290> that's

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
I wouldn't mess with much of this that's

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:37.890 
I wouldn't mess with much of this that's

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
go to mess with it for GPU you can

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.440 
go to mess with it for GPU you can
change<00:02:49.300> the<00:02:49.450> frequency<00:02:49.630> steps<00:02:50.470> this<00:02:51.100> is<00:02:51.250> how

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
change the frequency steps this is how

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.660 
change the frequency steps this is how
the<00:02:52.450> you<00:02:52.990> know<00:02:53.080> the<00:02:53.290> GPU<00:02:53.770> which<00:02:54.010> is<00:02:54.130> a<00:02:54.160> graphic

and actually there's a lot more stuff
I'm<00:04:02.079> not<00:04:02.290> sure<00:04:02.439> if<00:04:02.530> there's<00:04:02.709> a<00:04:02.769> little<00:04:02.920> lock

00:04:03.089 --> 00:04:03.099

I'm not sure if there's a little lock
screen<00:04:03.370> torch<00:04:04.230> no<00:04:05.230> I'm<00:04:05.470> not<00:04:05.709> sure<00:04:05.950> no<00:04:06.400> I<00:04:06.430> don't

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:06.640 
screen torch no I'm not sure no I don't

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:07.229 
screen torch no I'm not sure no I don't
think<00:04:06.819> so

00:04:07.229 --> 00:04:07.239 
think so

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:09.809
