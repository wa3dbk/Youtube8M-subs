00:00:06.069 --> 00:00:10.460
 the truth that will get me with another 

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:14.599
 video did not have much impact either 

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:17.680
 the other but well I did not spread it either 

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:20.359
 a lot this but always deadly that 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:23.240
 commented that he received and with that is 

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:26.060
 enough to upload someone else asked 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:29.210
 another one from zuma so that's what we're going to 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:31.039
 do in this case until rest that is one 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:33.820
 of the topics that particularly 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:33.820
 they like is um 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:40.390
 which is good and quite easy recontra 

00:00:38.199 --> 00:00:41.800
 good for beginners to play and 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:43.829
 also to grab a little more wave 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.829
 do not 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:49.219
 the part more easy chords 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.420
 and that are repeated throughout the song 

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:56.079
 the intro is an intro 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:58.870
 with an arpeggio I leave the tabla tura 

00:00:56.079 --> 00:01:01.289
 in the description and this one is going to sound 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:01.289
 something like that 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:15.710
 and it is repeated twice uses the agreed 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:18.010
 of the greatest and is simple a king 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:20.560
 go back to 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:23.520
 and then do the same 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.520
 and you touch 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:36.670
 and what it does is 123 down and it's going to 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:40.360
 the first quarter 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:43.560
 first second third evil king king 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:43.560
 it's the bass in the room 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:47.150
 3 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.650
 Y 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:50.750
 and three up starting from the 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:53.030
 first returns to the same as the 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:55.840
 beginning 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:55.840
 and it's going to me 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:59.150
 l min 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:09.160
 123 to the first 1 2 3 up 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:11.709
 repeat that twice and that's where we start 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:14.620
 recreate the radio that we are going to use or 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:18.870
 at least it is the one that I use is the one that 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.870
 there's a little more you think is this 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:29.770
 Y 

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:37.500
 you create music 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:43.750
 at first 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:54.420
 then except to 0 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:54.420
 up many again right away 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.610
 i 

00:02:59.859 --> 00:03:07.180
 then down upstairs right away 

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:09.069
 know is also conjugated although it complicates 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.930
 a little more 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:16.349
 and that with that range but you can use in 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:16.349
 the whole song change rhythm after 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.760
 all right 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:30.750
 lessons 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:37.610
 troop is better instead of using 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:42.140
 my oldest use a seventh major 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:44.319
 that we simply raise the room 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:46.250
 finger 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:48.170
 get up 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:50.690
 as she would he 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:51.730
 the minister that sounds best can be 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:55.489
 use the same 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:59.620
 my oldest is not bad and so they come to do 

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:59.620
 the whole song simply 

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:05.970
 and take it 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:05.970
 so 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.760
 and if you would need a video tutorial 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:14.950
 but out there like a little help 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:16.410
 mainly for the throne and the 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:19.709
 strum that out there one does not know well 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:22.990
 how to do it so how good would it be 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:27.210
 it would be everything 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:27.210
 I hope you have served them 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:31.550
 Comment on any other topic if you want 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:33.790
 that to know if you think a little bit of 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:33.790
 tone
