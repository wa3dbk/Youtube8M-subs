00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:31.330 
high-tech welding torch but that could
be<00:02:24.629> a<00:02:24.660> weapon<00:02:24.989> as<00:02:25.319> well<00:02:25.349> I<00:02:25.560> suppose

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.030 

both<00:02:32.340> of<00:02:32.580> these<00:02:33.080> hook<00:02:34.080> up<00:02:34.230> wires<00:02:34.470> attached<00:02:35.010> to

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
both of these hook up wires attached to

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.050 
both of these hook up wires attached to
the<00:02:35.370> backpack<00:02:37.069> and<00:02:38.069> I'll<00:02:38.190> just<00:02:38.370> remove<00:02:38.940> a

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
the backpack and I'll just remove a

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.330 
the backpack and I'll just remove a
backpack<00:02:39.510> now<00:02:39.750> and<00:02:40.620> you<00:02:40.709> can<00:02:40.830> actually<00:02:40.980> see

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
backpack now and you can actually see

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:46.850 
backpack now and you can actually see
the<00:02:43.069> the<00:02:44.069> backpack<00:02:44.549> has<00:02:45.000> a<00:02:45.380> sort<00:02:46.380> of<00:02:46.440> a<00:02:46.620> a

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
the the backpack has a sort of a a

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.210 
the the backpack has a sort of a a
handle<00:02:47.459> on<00:02:47.640> top<00:02:48.030> but<00:02:48.959> it's<00:02:49.110> really<00:02:49.650> thick<00:02:49.980> I

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
handle on top but it's really thick I

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.780 
handle on top but it's really thick I
would<00:02:51.180> really<00:02:51.810> not<00:02:51.900> recommend<00:02:52.680> using<00:02:53.489> that<00:02:53.610> as

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
would really not recommend using that as

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.850 
would really not recommend using that as
a<00:02:53.940> handhold<00:02:54.360> for<00:02:54.660> the<00:02:54.720> figures<00:02:55.049> hands<00:02:55.440> because

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
a handhold for the figures hands because

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:57.650 
a handhold for the figures hands because
I'm<00:02:56.370> pretty<00:02:56.579> sure<00:02:56.730> that<00:02:56.940> would<00:02:57.060> snap<00:02:57.390> off<00:02:57.630> the

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
I'm pretty sure that would snap off the

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:06.319 
I'm pretty sure that would snap off the
thumb<00:03:00.170> in<00:03:01.170> the<00:03:01.500> slots<00:03:04.760> we<00:03:05.760> have<00:03:05.940> what<00:03:06.299> I

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:06.329 
thumb in the slots we have what I

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:13.339 
thumb in the slots we have what I
believe<00:03:06.420> is<00:03:06.900> the<00:03:07.220> hydraulic<00:03:08.220> clamp<00:03:12.200> it<00:03:13.200> also

00:03:13.339 --> 00:03:13.349 
believe is the hydraulic clamp it also

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:16.059 
believe is the hydraulic clamp it also
has<00:03:13.620> a<00:03:13.650> peg<00:03:13.980> on<00:03:14.160> the<00:03:14.310> end<00:03:14.459> so<00:03:14.940> you<00:03:15.030> can<00:03:15.209> use<00:03:15.390> the

00:03:16.059 --> 00:03:16.069 
has a peg on the end so you can use the

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:26.490 
has a peg on the end so you can use the
second<00:03:17.069> wire<00:03:17.720> just<00:03:18.720> to<00:03:18.810> attach<00:03:19.440> to<00:03:19.709> this

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.920 

another<00:03:27.500> item<00:03:27.740> which<00:03:28.100> I<00:03:28.280> have<00:03:28.760> already<00:03:29.060> hooked

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:29.930 
another item which I have already hooked

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:45.390 
another item which I have already hooked
up<00:03:32.110> is<00:03:33.130> the<00:03:34.130> Vario<00:03:34.820> wrench

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:45.400 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:51.000 

it<00:03:45.970> just<00:03:46.180> pops<00:03:46.420> up<00:03:46.629> just<00:03:46.870> like<00:03:46.959> that<00:03:50.010> and

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.010 
it just pops up just like that and

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:54.949 
it just pops up just like that and
lastly<00:03:51.400> we<00:03:51.640> have<00:03:52.980> the<00:03:53.980> forged<00:03:54.489> steel

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:54.959 
lastly we have the forged steel

00:03:54.959 --> 00:04:04.320 
lastly we have the forged steel
sledgehammer

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:04.330 

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:08.190 

it's<00:04:05.020> a<00:04:05.340> rather<00:04:06.340> narrow<00:04:06.670> unfortunately<00:04:07.390> and

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:08.200 
it's a rather narrow unfortunately and

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:09.780 
it's a rather narrow unfortunately and
all<00:04:08.350> these<00:04:08.560> fit<00:04:08.860> on<00:04:08.980> their<00:04:09.190> figures<00:04:09.520> hands

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:09.790 
all these fit on their figures hands

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:14.940 
all these fit on their figures hands
relatively<00:04:10.720> well<00:04:11.250> even<00:04:12.250> with<00:04:12.430> the<00:04:13.680> attach<00:04:14.680> to

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:14.950 
relatively well even with the attach to

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:16.860 
relatively well even with the attach to
hook<00:04:15.100> up<00:04:15.250> wires<00:04:15.520> kind<00:04:16.030> of<00:04:16.090> tugging<00:04:16.510> on<00:04:16.660> these

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:16.870 
hook up wires kind of tugging on these

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:18.720 
hook up wires kind of tugging on these
things<00:04:17.080> it's<00:04:17.380> still<00:04:17.560> bigger<00:04:18.100> still<00:04:18.400> holds<00:04:18.640> it

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:18.730 
things it's still bigger still holds it

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:23.040 
things it's still bigger still holds it
rather<00:04:18.880> well<00:04:21.300> the<00:04:22.300> slots<00:04:22.540> on<00:04:22.720> the<00:04:22.750> backpack

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:23.050 
rather well the slots on the backpack

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:26.400 
rather well the slots on the backpack
are<00:04:23.590> actually<00:04:23.920> Universal<00:04:24.580> so<00:04:25.240> there<00:04:26.050> isn't<00:04:26.170> a

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:26.410 
are actually Universal so there isn't a

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:28.680 
are actually Universal so there isn't a
particular<00:04:26.830> spot<00:04:27.370> for<00:04:27.670> a<00:04:27.700> particular<00:04:28.060> tool

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:28.690 
particular spot for a particular tool

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:30.720 
particular spot for a particular tool
that<00:04:28.960> he<00:04:29.080> has<00:04:29.260> you<00:04:29.920> can<00:04:30.040> just<00:04:30.220> put<00:04:30.430> them<00:04:30.550> in

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:30.730 
that he has you can just put them in

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:34.020 
that he has you can just put them in

actually fairly easy to find on the

expensive<00:05:36.020> which<00:05:37.020> is<00:05:37.169> great<00:05:37.470> for<00:05:37.650> collectors

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:38.100 
expensive which is great for collectors

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:39.830 
expensive which is great for collectors
because<00:05:38.280> many<00:05:38.850> collectors<00:05:39.180> actually<00:05:39.540> buy

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:39.840 
because many collectors actually buy

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:43.060 
because many collectors actually buy
more<00:05:40.169> than<00:05:40.320> one<00:05:40.530> of<00:05:40.650> this<00:05:40.800> figure<00:05:41.240> in<00:05:42.240> fact
