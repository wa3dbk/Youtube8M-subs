problem I'm looking for something and
here<00:00:53.309> is<00:00:53.809> the<00:00:54.809> whole<00:00:54.960> reason<00:00:55.320> for<00:00:55.559> doing<00:00:55.710> this

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
here is the whole reason for doing this

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.049 
here is the whole reason for doing this
that's<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:57.050> 70d<00:00:58.670> if<00:00:59.670> you<00:00:59.730> didn't<00:00:59.940> already

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
that's the 70d if you didn't already

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.660 
that's the 70d if you didn't already
know<00:01:00.239> this<00:01:00.899> has<00:01:01.109> a<00:01:01.140> new<00:01:01.350> technology<00:01:02.070> called

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
know this has a new technology called

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:08.120 
know this has a new technology called
dual<00:01:03.059> pixel<00:01:03.890> autofocus<00:01:04.890> and<00:01:06.799> I'm<00:01:07.799> not<00:01:07.979> sure

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
dual pixel autofocus and I'm not sure

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.429 
dual pixel autofocus and I'm not sure
how<00:01:08.250> it<00:01:08.369> works<00:01:08.610> but<00:01:08.909> it<00:01:09.060> basically<00:01:09.180> allows<00:01:10.170> you

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
how it works but it basically allows you

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.700 
how it works but it basically allows you
to<00:01:10.500> do<00:01:10.979> auto<00:01:11.310> focus<00:01:11.760> in<00:01:12.000> Live<00:01:12.299> View<00:01:12.689> mode<00:01:13.200> and

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
to do auto focus in Live View mode and

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.800 
to do auto focus in Live View mode and
video<00:01:14.159> mode<00:01:14.460> which<00:01:15.240> is<00:01:15.390> supposed<00:01:15.600> to<00:01:15.659> look

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
video mode which is supposed to look

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.950 
video mode which is supposed to look
pretty<00:01:16.439> natural<00:01:16.619> and<00:01:17.340> it's<00:01:17.700> very<00:01:17.939> fast<00:01:18.240> here

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960

so far I really just want to try the
dual<00:04:42.630> pixel<00:04:42.780> autofocus<00:04:43.020> is<00:04:43.590> just<00:04:43.950> a<00:04:44.010> test<00:04:44.190> of

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:44.310 
dual pixel autofocus is just a test of

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:47.020 
dual pixel autofocus is just a test of
that<00:04:44.430> I<00:04:44.700> hope<00:04:45.180> you<00:04:45.330> liked<00:04:45.810> this<00:04:46.080> review<00:04:46.470> its

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:52.110 
BAM that was pretty quick it's pretty

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:57.440 
BAM that was pretty quick it's pretty
quick<00:04:54.260> for<00:04:55.260> people's<00:04:55.590> faces<00:04:55.860> it<00:04:56.310> has<00:04:57.120> the<00:04:57.270> face

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:57.450 
quick for people's faces it has the face

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:00.440 
quick for people's faces it has the face
detection<00:04:57.840> so<00:04:58.169> it<00:04:58.290> quickly<00:04:58.740> grabs<00:04:59.010> it<00:04:59.450> that's

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:00.450 
detection so it quickly grabs it that's

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:03.380 
detection so it quickly grabs it that's
really<00:05:00.780> cool<00:05:01.110> dude<00:05:01.580> we<00:05:02.580> might<00:05:02.730> need<00:05:02.850> to<00:05:02.910> stop

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:03.390 
really cool dude we might need to stop

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:05.030 
really cool dude we might need to stop
this<00:05:03.660> you<00:05:04.169> might<00:05:04.290> need<00:05:04.350> to<00:05:04.440> get<00:05:04.560> this<00:05:04.680> camera

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:05.040 
this you might need to get this camera

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:07.730 
this you might need to get this camera
for<00:05:05.220> vlogging<00:05:06.120> just<00:05:06.990> reference<00:05:07.350> that<00:05:07.470> change

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:07.740 
for vlogging just reference that change

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:10.850 
for vlogging just reference that change
the<00:05:07.980> lens<00:05:08.490> to<00:05:08.790> a<00:05:08.820> 50<00:05:09.180> millimeter<00:05:09.360> 1.4<00:05:10.320> I<00:05:10.560> could

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:10.860 
the lens to a 50 millimeter 1.4 I could

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:12.409 
the lens to a 50 millimeter 1.4 I could
kind<00:05:11.130> of<00:05:11.190> feel<00:05:11.400> it<00:05:11.460> focusing<00:05:12.060> which<00:05:12.210> isn't

00:05:12.409 --> 00:05:12.419 
kind of feel it focusing which isn't

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:14.510 
kind of feel it focusing which isn't
very<00:05:12.780> good<00:05:12.870> I'm<00:05:13.290> thinking<00:05:13.770> that<00:05:13.950> that<00:05:13.979> Sigma

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:14.520 
very good I'm thinking that that Sigma

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:17.860 
very good I'm thinking that that Sigma
lens<00:05:14.700> might<00:05:15.030> be<00:05:15.240> a<00:05:15.479> much<00:05:15.870> better<00:05:16.139> pair<00:05:17.010> than

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:17.870 
lens might be a much better pair than

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:20.629 
lens might be a much better pair than
this<00:05:18.870> lens<00:05:19.200> I<00:05:19.560> thought<00:05:19.950> I<00:05:19.979> would<00:05:20.220> try<00:05:20.400> it<00:05:20.520> out

00:05:20.629 --> 00:05:20.639 
this lens I thought I would try it out

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:21.680 
this lens I thought I would try it out
with<00:05:20.760> something<00:05:20.940> that<00:05:21.180> has<00:05:21.270> a<00:05:21.300> lot<00:05:21.390> of<00:05:21.479> depth

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:21.690 
with something that has a lot of depth

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:23.390 
with something that has a lot of depth
of<00:05:21.780> field<00:05:21.930> right<00:05:22.560> now<00:05:22.650> I'm<00:05:22.740> at<00:05:22.830> 1.8<00:05:23.280> I'll

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:23.400 
of field right now I'm at 1.8 I'll

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:25.990 
of field right now I'm at 1.8 I'll
switch<00:05:23.610> it<00:05:23.640> to<00:05:23.760> 1.4<00:05:24.630> so<00:05:24.930> you<00:05:25.020> could<00:05:25.140> see<00:05:25.320> how<00:05:25.470> it

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:26.000 
switch it to 1.4 so you could see how it

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.060 
switch it to 1.4 so you could see how it
works<00:05:27.000> at<00:05:27.660> the<00:05:27.990> high<00:05:28.140> lowest<00:05:28.710> temperature

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:29.070 
works at the high lowest temperature

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:32.390 
works at the high lowest temperature
possible<00:05:30.440> and<00:05:31.440> I'm<00:05:31.560> kind<00:05:31.770> of<00:05:31.830> curious<00:05:32.070> we

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:32.400 
possible and I'm kind of curious we

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:33.710 
possible and I'm kind of curious we
haven't<00:05:32.640> watched<00:05:32.760> the<00:05:32.910> footage<00:05:33.120> back<00:05:33.360> yet<00:05:33.570> I'm

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:33.720 
haven't watched the footage back yet I'm

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:36.830 
haven't watched the footage back yet I'm
curious<00:05:34.050> if<00:05:34.910> there<00:05:35.910> will<00:05:36.000> be<00:05:36.060> sound<00:05:36.510> and<00:05:36.720> the

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:36.840 
curious if there will be sound and the

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:38.210 
curious if there will be sound and the
other<00:05:36.960> one<00:05:37.169> because<00:05:37.350> it<00:05:37.530> seemed<00:05:37.800> pretty

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:38.220 
other one because it seemed pretty

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:40.670 
other one because it seemed pretty
silent<00:05:38.820> and<00:05:39.570> I<00:05:39.630> didn't<00:05:39.840> feel<00:05:40.050> anything<00:05:40.229> but<00:05:40.620> I

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:40.680 
silent and I didn't feel anything but I

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:42.440 
silent and I didn't feel anything but I
could<00:05:40.950> hear<00:05:41.280> it<00:05:41.400> kind<00:05:41.610> of<00:05:41.700> crunching<00:05:42.180> a<00:05:42.240> little

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:42.450 
could hear it kind of crunching a little

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:43.760 
could hear it kind of crunching a little
bit<00:05:42.539> with<00:05:42.630> this<00:05:42.750> 50<00:05:43.110> millimeter<00:05:43.500> won't<00:05:43.650> play

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:43.770 
bit with this 50 millimeter won't play

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:45.800 
bit with this 50 millimeter won't play
