00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:22.150
 very good to all welcome be to 

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:24.009
 channel I am a parrot and today we will be 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:26.770
 watching a video tutorial on how to do 

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:29.140
 that our computer go much more 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:31.570
 fluid go faster you will have a better 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:35.500
 performance in what would be open 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:39.550
 tabbed windows run programs 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:41.050
 and other this program this tutorial what 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:42.550
 we will perform without needing 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.110
 download any program simply 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:46.930
 let's access the system registry 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:49.000
 and we are going to edit there a little thing is something 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:52.000
 very simple after doing this 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.940
 tutorial I suggest you also pass 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.280
 for the other video of optimizing windows 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:59.170
 that I have that I'm going to leave the 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.820
 link up here if you have the 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:03.489
 active annotations up here in the 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:05.410
 video or below in the description of 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:08.020
 video will be the link so that the 

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:11.170
 tutorial that joining it with this are going to 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:13.659
 achieve a great improvement in 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.850
 in the performance of your system in this 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:19.509
 tutorial we can do it with windows 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:21.009
 7 windows vista or windows xp good for 

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:22.689
 we are going to go to the beginning we are going to 

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:25.000
 write here in this search field 

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:27.480
 regedit 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:31.260
 and we are going to select 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:34.410
 this little program here regedit leaving it 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:37.560
 we select and we are going now to go where 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:39.930
 says hkey local machine 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.329
 unfold by clicking on the little arrow 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.490
 to this arrow that is here we click 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:47.460
 and we unfold let's see where it says 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:51.000
 software we deploy we will search 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:53.530
 microsoft we deploy let's search 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.680
 now where say windows 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:59.080
 here is we are deploying we are going to give 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:01.270
 current version we deploy and go to 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:04.539
 search for explorer 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:06.939
 more simply we select it not what 

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:10.539
 we deploy and now we are going to go to edition 

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:13.030
 new and we're going to write a new value 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:15.790
 chain in the case of windows xp oa 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:17.260
 say numerical harp value or in windows 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:20.080
 sight I think it also goes value 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:21.730
 numeric an alphanumeric value and value 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:24.160
 of chain are the same we are going to 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:25.959
 select them and we will write here 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:30.040
 where it says a new value number one 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:32.819
 the following to the weiss 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.819
 a blog 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:38.600
 and at the end of it, just as it is 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:40.310
 I'm going to leave it here anyway 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:43.250
 description of the video so that 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:45.890
 it is simply copy and paste the first 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:48.560
 uppercase letter side capitalized and 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:51.710
 the final three letters of ll also 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:54.380
 uppercase we give it to enter and now 

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:56.060
 let's double- click on it and here where 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:58.370
 says value information in this field 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.930
 let's add a number one we give 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:02.570
 to accept 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:06.950
 we close here and good and this would be all 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:09.230
 the video tutorial today with this 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:10.700
 we would have realized what would be the 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:12.349
 improvement of the optimization let's 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.540
 restart the system so that it arises 

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:17.810
 effect what we did and we're going to start 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:19.970
 to notice that the programs are open to us 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:21.830
 much faster that also runs us 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:24.290
 faster the system a little bit more 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:28.640
 fluid the windows open with greater 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:31.280
 speed and everything else I invite you to 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:33.019
 visit the other tutorial that is from 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:34.819
 optimize the computer I will leave you the 

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:38.780
 link below I'll put it back here 

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:40.549
