00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.030
 hello everyone knows the tutorials of 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:04.589
 water and is today I'm in my 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.760
 cooking because we're going to do a tutorial 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:09.809
 a little special so indicated white so 

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:11.400
 know what that means 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.290
 what we do ourselves and 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.790
 Today we will use the crayola 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.220
 but why 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.900
 and just because we're going 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.820
 make lipsticks and it turns out 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.800
 in writing yola ago 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.470
 mostly of the sir who is eaten 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.119
 and the dyes are not toxic this 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.000
 which is made expressly for children of 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.380
 0.1 in Scotland so no problem on 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.870
 can make lipsticks 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.219
 so see it's nice with riscle 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:39.899
 to write there is that there are plenty of 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:42.210
 colors so we will be able to do full 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.219
 of lipstick in pretty fun colors 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.579
 and on top of that we will mix the 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.960
 colors created an original color 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:50.309
 so here I am going to show you everything from 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.879
 what you need 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:55.649
 So we will have the griots 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:01:02.160
 coconut oil so here from 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:03.059
 natessance of the containers and a pan 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.909
 with each other 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:09.560
 so we boiled and then we go 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.560
 put a small container 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:19.659
 and we're going to put a spoon of 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:23.020
 our skin that we pour into our 

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:27.670
 container and then we will call our 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:29.619
 primary she we chose and we see 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:33.250
 cut it in a few pieces for its 

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:35.970
 slope faster and we'll put it in 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:35.970
 the recipient 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:44.650
 and we're waiting for it 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:47.760
 once everything is melted we go quickly 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:47.760
 pour into the container 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:58.560
 and then we'll put 10 to 15 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:02:00.880
 minutes the container in the fridge 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.140
 ok so now that we did our 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.220
 lipstick here is what it gives 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.990
 when he will know the boxes 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:08.590
 so you can see parliament the 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:11.920
 colors look super flash and that has 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:15.390
 look well pigmented so we're going 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.390

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:03.709

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:05.060
