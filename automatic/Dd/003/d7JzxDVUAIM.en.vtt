00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:14.510
 to live in the city center like here 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:17.180
 in Paris and be able to enjoy nature 

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:18.890
 from the open air while staying 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:21.080
 at home it is possible provided 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:28.460
 however avoid on the top floor or 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:30.289
 at least have access to a terrace for 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.029
 sir kaufmann from the terrace company 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:33.679
 nature dressed in wood a terrace 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:35.300
 large or small will allow you as well 

00:00:33.679 --> 00:00:37.420
 to take full advantage of your 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:40.010
 apartment in town 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:41.960
 here we are typically in a 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:44.269
 urban environment we are in the seventh 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.639
 floor we have a beautiful view and we have 

00:00:44.269 --> 00:00:49.190
 a magnificent terrace of 70 mÂ² 

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:50.839
 almost had to take advantage of it 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:52.639
 so when we are when we arrived 

00:00:50.839 --> 00:00:54.409
 it is true that this terrace was 

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:56.209
 with gravel slabs of old 

00:00:54.409 --> 00:00:58.339
 grating it was a little sad 

00:00:56.209 --> 00:01:00.829
 we made the choice the customer did the 

00:00:58.339 --> 00:01:04.040
 choice to install a decking wood so 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:05.449
 a wooden deck and it's a choice 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.180
 which imposed itself quite naturally 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:12.109
 because you had to be able to install 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:14.090
 a building site here without overloading the roof 

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:16.609
 it was not necessary to put too much of 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:19.039
 weight on the seal on on the on the 

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:21.049
 roof you had to be able to have a 

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:23.000
 easy to assemble material easy to 

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:25.700
 install it can be eventually 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.619
 a little bit removable and we have 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.749
 decided to install this wooden terrace 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:31.909
 two months were enough to develop this 

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:32.719
 terrace of 70 square meters in the heart of 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:34.130
 Paris 

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:36.409
 because the wood has many 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:39.259
 benefits that sits says that poses the 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:41.090
 implementation is quite easy we could 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:43.789
 create this terrace we put his blades 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:45.579
 of terrace on joists it is a 

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:48.950
 site that is quite easy to achieve 

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:51.619
 which is clean overload not the 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:53.899
 floor and this is a building site that makes 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:55.789
 not so much noise so here's all 

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:58.100
 conditions were met for for 

00:01:55.789 --> 00:02:00.139
 choose the wood material on on this 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:02.600
 terrace in urban environment 

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:04.310
 the decking and simply laid on the 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:07.249
 roof of the condominium while 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:09.170
 preserving its tightness and in case 

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:09.590
 roof intervention nothing more 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:12.019
 simple 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:14.239
 the wooden deck she is simply 

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:16.430
 life so if we had to dismantle the 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:18.680
 part underneath me we have thirty 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:19.989
 some 40 screws to dismount for 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.799
 can be immediately visualized 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:23.870
 the underlying seal 

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:27.349
 work can be done at less 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:28.549
 cool quite easily a terrace in 

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:30.650
 wood does not require maintenance 

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:32.989
 In particular, they resist 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.909
 bad weather and dries the wood quickly 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:39.500
 will skate and gray and slightly 

00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:41.269
 with time if we wanted to make it 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.730
 recover its initial color 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:45.950
 you just have to give him a 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.390
 saturator once a year let's say in 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:49.250
 month season entry February month 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:51.590
 March there for half a day 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:54.110
 we pass a saturator the goual finds 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.909
 his initial colors the color he 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:57.980
 had when we installed the 

00:02:55.909 --> 00:03:01.099
 terrace and we left for a 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:02.930
 season a season of amenity and for 

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:05.030
 sir de villers the owner of 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:06.680
 this apartment in the center of paris 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:09.200
 the wooden deck has changed 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:11.180
 deeply his habits before there 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.670
 had an apartment and a roof goal with 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:15.319
 a bacterium today the summer we pass 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:17.150
 our life on the terrace and suddenly 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:17.840
 obviously beautiful apartment he doubled 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:20.239
 of surface 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.920
 it creates relationships that are very 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:23.720
 different finally when we discuss 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:25.219
 with his friends on a terrace we 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:27.349
 feel in nature even if we are in 

00:03:25.219 --> 00:03:28.939
 in the middle of the 8th it's different than 

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:31.280
 to be in a sofa in front of a table 

00:03:28.939 --> 00:03:32.209
 bass with his glass an atmosphere that 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:35.239
 is completely different people 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:36.890
 are on the way the sky and sinks one sees 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:38.810
 the sky sends the Germans rather sees 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:41.329
 the sky all the terraces every 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:43.129
 balconies we always have a solution for 

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:45.049
 to build a beautiful terrace a 

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:46.939
 beautiful decking wood when one is in a 

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:49.629
 environment in downtown one 

00:03:46.939 --> 00:03:49.629
 urban environment
