00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.070 
you
I<00:02:19.610> could<00:02:20.000> hack<00:02:20.209> at<00:02:20.360> you<00:02:20.480> I<00:02:20.540> could<00:02:20.660> hit<00:02:20.870> your

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
I could hack at you I could hit your

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:22.510 
I could hack at you I could hit your
arms<00:02:21.350> I<00:02:21.470> could<00:02:21.530> hit<00:02:21.680> your<00:02:21.890> legs<00:02:22.070> you'd<00:02:22.280> still

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:22.520 
arms I could hit your legs you'd still

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.310 
arms I could hit your legs you'd still
live<00:02:22.730> through<00:02:23.000> it<00:02:23.090> if<00:02:23.180> you're<00:02:23.330> lucky<00:02:23.510> if<00:02:24.140> I

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:24.320 
live through it if you're lucky if I

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:26.199 
live through it if you're lucky if I
stick<00:02:24.890> you<00:02:24.920> with<00:02:25.130> one<00:02:25.280> of<00:02:25.310> these<00:02:25.489> you're<00:02:25.970> dead

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:26.209 
stick you with one of these you're dead

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:29.229 
stick you with one of these you're dead
so<00:02:26.900> virtually<00:02:27.320> all<00:02:27.470> of<00:02:27.530> true<00:02:28.370> rapier<00:02:28.820> work<00:02:29.000> is

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:29.239 
so virtually all of true rapier work is

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:31.479 
so virtually all of true rapier work is
pointe<00:02:29.750> work<00:02:29.950> the<00:02:30.950> other<00:02:31.070> thing<00:02:31.280> is<00:02:31.370> that

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:31.489 
pointe work the other thing is that

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:34.060 
pointe work the other thing is that
these<00:02:31.580> weapons<00:02:31.790> were<00:02:32.060> extremely<00:02:32.510> long<00:02:33.070> yeah

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:34.070 
these weapons were extremely long yeah

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:36.100 
these weapons were extremely long yeah
just<00:02:34.760> think<00:02:34.940> of<00:02:35.120> how<00:02:35.209> quickly<00:02:35.600> you<00:02:35.840> can<00:02:35.900> do<00:02:36.080> a

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
just think of how quickly you can do a

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.610 
just think of how quickly you can do a
thrust

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
thrust

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.580 
thrust
don't<00:02:36.770> move<00:02:36.920> back<00:02:37.370> ok<00:02:37.940> it's<00:02:38.540> a<00:02:38.690> split<00:02:39.140> second

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
don't move back ok it's a split second

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:40.660 
don't move back ok it's a split second
stay<00:02:40.310> where<00:02:40.430> you<00:02:40.520> are

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
stay where you are

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:44.500 
stay where you are
any<00:02:40.910> thrust<00:02:41.680> you<00:02:42.680> can<00:02:42.830> get<00:02:43.010> to<00:02:43.610> 3<00:02:43.970> thrusts<00:02:44.420> in

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
any thrust you can get to 3 thrusts in

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:47.410 
any thrust you can get to 3 thrusts in
in<00:02:44.660> a<00:02:44.750> second<00:02:45.320> for<00:02:46.160> defense<00:02:46.549> a<00:02:46.850> musketeer

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
in a second for defense a musketeer

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.000 
in a second for defense a musketeer
might<00:02:47.660> use<00:02:47.840> his<00:02:48.019> glove<00:02:48.290> to<00:02:48.500> grab<00:02:48.830> at<00:02:48.980> his

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
might use his glove to grab at his

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.250 
might use his glove to grab at his
opponent's<00:02:49.580> rapier<00:02:49.940> and<00:02:50.150> immobilize<00:02:50.870> it<00:02:51.049> if

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
opponent's rapier and immobilize it if

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.650 
opponent's rapier and immobilize it if
he<00:02:51.830> had<00:02:51.950> a<00:02:51.980> cloak<00:02:52.340> that<00:02:52.610> too<00:02:53.090> could<00:02:53.360> be<00:02:53.450> used

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:53.660 
he had a cloak that too could be used

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:56.530 
he had a cloak that too could be used
for<00:02:53.780> protection<00:02:54.380> but<00:02:55.310> a<00:02:55.370> well-armed<00:02:56.000> duelist

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
for protection but a well-armed duelist

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.900 
for protection but a well-armed duelist
would<00:02:56.989> be<00:02:57.140> armed<00:02:57.470> with<00:02:57.650> something<00:02:57.890> more<00:02:58.220> all

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 
would be armed with something more all

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:00.430 
would be armed with something more all
right<00:02:58.940> now<00:02:59.150> this<00:02:59.299> is<00:02:59.570> a<00:02:59.600> very<00:02:59.870> small<00:03:00.080> shield

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 
right now this is a very small shield

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.350 
right now this is a very small shield
called<00:03:00.739> a<00:03:00.860> buckler<00:03:01.250> this<00:03:01.820> is<00:03:01.970> pretty<00:03:02.150> good

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360 
called a buckler this is pretty good

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.479 
called a buckler this is pretty good
because<00:03:03.019> if<00:03:03.170> you<00:03:03.380> use<00:03:03.560> this<00:03:03.739> in<00:03:03.980> the<00:03:04.070> left<00:03:04.220> hand

00:03:04.479 --> 00:03:04.489 
because if you use this in the left hand

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:06.820 
because if you use this in the left hand
and<00:03:04.670> hold<00:03:04.880> it<00:03:05.090> well<00:03:05.299> out<00:03:05.450> it<00:03:06.200> means<00:03:06.440> that

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:06.830 
and hold it well out it means that

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:10.509 
and hold it well out it means that
virtually<00:03:07.100> your<00:03:07.489> whole<00:03:07.730> body<00:03:08.060> is<00:03:08.299> covered<00:03:09.519> but

00:03:10.509 --> 00:03:10.519 
virtually your whole body is covered but

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:12.160 
virtually your whole body is covered but
the<00:03:10.579> buckler<00:03:11.060> became<00:03:11.360> deadweight<00:03:11.840> if<00:03:12.079> the

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
the buckler became deadweight if the

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:14.979 
the buckler became deadweight if the
fighting<00:03:12.410> got<00:03:12.709> too<00:03:12.890> close<00:03:13.540> the<00:03:14.540> ideal

00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:14.989 
fighting got too close the ideal

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:17.110 
fighting got too close the ideal
complement<00:03:15.590> of<00:03:15.799> the<00:03:15.890> rapier<00:03:16.220> was<00:03:16.700> the<00:03:16.880> left

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
complement of the rapier was the left

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:20.080 
complement of the rapier was the left
hand<00:03:17.390> dagger<00:03:18.100> all<00:03:19.100> right<00:03:19.280> this<00:03:19.489> is<00:03:19.610> an<00:03:19.730> ideal

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
hand dagger all right this is an ideal

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:21.880 
hand dagger all right this is an ideal
