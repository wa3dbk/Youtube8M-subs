the same thing but just instead of the
golems<00:00:17.670> what<00:00:17.850> are<00:00:17.940> we<00:00:18.000> doing<00:00:18.210> the<00:00:18.359> hog<00:00:18.539> riders

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
golems what are we doing the hog riders

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.929 
golems what are we doing the hog riders
I<00:00:19.140> believe<00:00:19.650> in<00:00:19.740> the<00:00:19.830> last<00:00:19.949> episode<00:00:20.310> I<00:00:20.430> did<00:00:20.490> say

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
I believe in the last episode I did say

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.019 
I believe in the last episode I did say
that<00:00:20.970> the<00:00:21.270> gloves<00:00:21.570> once<00:00:21.840> level<00:00:22.140> 3<00:00:22.410> but<00:00:23.070> now<00:00:23.310> now

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
that the gloves once level 3 but now now

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:25.519 
that the gloves once level 3 but now now
that<00:00:24.210> I<00:00:24.269> see<00:00:24.510> it<00:00:24.539> like<00:00:24.840> they're<00:00:25.170> actually

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
that I see it like they're actually

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.650 
that I see it like they're actually
maxed<00:00:25.890> out<00:00:26.039> which<00:00:26.490> is<00:00:26.640> level<00:00:26.760> 2<00:00:27.000> which<00:00:27.240> I<00:00:27.390> did

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
maxed out which is level 2 which I did

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.929 
maxed out which is level 2 which I did
not<00:00:27.750> actually<00:00:27.930> know<00:00:28.380> so<00:00:28.980> I<00:00:29.010> was<00:00:29.130> about<00:00:29.279> like<00:00:29.519> I

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
not actually know so I was about like I

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.460 
not actually know so I was about like I
was<00:00:30.119> a<00:00:30.179> bit<00:00:30.300> surprised<00:00:30.539> about<00:00:30.660> that<00:00:30.810> so<00:00:31.140> and

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
was a bit surprised about that so and

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.049 
was a bit surprised about that so and
this<00:00:31.980> episode<00:00:32.279> wouldn't<00:00:32.489> be<00:00:32.550> doing<00:00:32.730> the<00:00:32.820> hog

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
this episode wouldn't be doing the hog

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:34.580 
this episode wouldn't be doing the hog
riders<00:00:33.420> I<00:00:33.570> believe<00:00:33.809> they<00:00:33.930> go<00:00:34.020> to<00:00:34.079> level<00:00:34.350> 4

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
mistaken so my biggest raid was this one

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.660 
mistaken so my biggest raid was this one
and<00:01:39.570> basically<00:01:40.350> I'm<00:01:40.770> just<00:01:40.799> dropping<00:01:41.579> my

get that loot and that's about it I'm

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.940 
get that loot and that's about it I'm
not<00:01:44.970> trying<00:01:45.030> like<00:01:45.509> I'm<00:01:45.689> not<00:01:45.840> literally<00:01:46.200> trying

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
not trying like I'm not literally trying

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.130 
not trying like I'm not literally trying
like<00:01:47.579> I'm<00:01:47.820> just<00:01:48.060> dropping<00:01:48.509> my<00:01:48.600> troops<00:01:48.899> and

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
like I'm just dropping my troops and

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.170 
like I'm just dropping my troops and
magically<00:01:49.890> gets<00:01:50.130> the<00:01:50.310> recollection<00:01:50.790> which<00:01:50.970> is

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
magically gets the recollection which is

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.700 
magically gets the recollection which is
what's<00:01:51.840> supposed<00:01:52.020> to<00:01:52.170> happen<00:01:52.259> because

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
what's supposed to happen because

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.830 
what's supposed to happen because
balloon<00:01:53.579> Ian<00:01:53.790> it's<00:01:54.030> kind<00:01:54.270> of<00:01:54.299> Oh<00:01:54.390> Pete<00:01:54.630> when

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
balloon Ian it's kind of Oh Pete when

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.030 
balloon Ian it's kind of Oh Pete when
the<00:01:54.960> base<00:01:55.140> is<00:01:55.320> not<00:01:55.439> actually<00:01:55.770> good<00:01:55.920> these

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
the base is not actually good these

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.830 
the base is not actually good these
bases<00:01:56.369> I've<00:01:56.490> attacked<00:01:56.790> me<00:01:56.969> right<00:01:57.119> here<00:01:57.390> and

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
bases I've attacked me right here and

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.620 
bases I've attacked me right here and
they're<00:01:58.020> either<00:01:58.369> rushed<00:01:59.369> with<00:01:59.729> talent<00:02:00.090> 7<00:02:00.420> or

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
they're either rushed with talent 7 or

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.550 
they're either rushed with talent 7 or
just<00:02:01.350> like<00:02:01.619> we<00:02:02.520> call<00:02:02.729> inactive<00:02:03.600> so<00:02:03.840> it<00:02:04.409> was

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
just like we call inactive so it was

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.530 
just like we call inactive so it was
pretty<00:02:04.710> good<00:02:04.890> I<00:02:05.100> got<00:02:05.610> some<00:02:05.790> dark<00:02:05.939> elixir<00:02:06.149> last

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
pretty good I got some dark elixir last

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.029 
pretty good I got some dark elixir last
night<00:02:06.719> was<00:02:06.899> got<00:02:07.049> a<00:02:07.079> lot<00:02:07.409> of<00:02:07.500> thought<00:02:07.649> glacier

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
night was got a lot of thought glacier

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.100 
night was got a lot of thought glacier
and<00:02:08.220> yes<00:02:08.580> so<00:02:08.789> look<00:02:09.479> about<00:02:09.569> some<00:02:09.780> more<00:02:09.869> raids

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
and yes so look about some more raids

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.360 
and yes so look about some more raids
the<00:02:10.319> other<00:02:10.410> one<00:02:10.560> was<00:02:10.709> a<00:02:10.739> thousand<00:02:11.190> 300

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
the other one was a thousand 300

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.760 
the other one was a thousand 300
let's<00:02:13.760> look<00:02:13.910> at<00:02:14.090> this<00:02:14.330> one<00:02:14.510> right<00:02:14.660> here<00:02:14.989> and<00:02:15.140> I

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:15.770 
let's look at this one right here and I

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:17.500 
let's look at this one right here and I
think<00:02:15.980> I<00:02:16.040> had<00:02:16.160> a<00:02:16.190> close<00:02:16.520> one<00:02:16.790> really<00:02:17.209> quick

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
think I had a close one really quick

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.360 
think I had a close one really quick
some<00:02:18.200> of<00:02:18.319> the<00:02:18.410> one<00:02:18.830> of<00:02:18.860> the<00:02:18.980> races<00:02:19.160> I<00:02:19.250> had

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
some of the one of the races I had

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.760 
some of the one of the races I had
closed<00:02:19.640> so<00:02:19.760> this<00:02:19.880> one<00:02:20.000> actually<00:02:20.150> my<00:02:20.599> old<00:02:20.870> base

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:21.770 
closed so this one actually my old base

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:24.100 
closed so this one actually my old base
is<00:02:22.099> called<00:02:22.459> the<00:02:22.730> colt<00:02:23.420> I<00:02:23.480> think<00:02:23.810> it's<00:02:23.930> called

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
is called the colt I think it's called

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:25.330 
is called the colt I think it's called
nada<00:02:24.290> this<00:02:24.440> is<00:02:24.560> not<00:02:24.680> the<00:02:24.800> call<00:02:24.950> the<00:02:25.099> golden

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
nada this is not the call the golden

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.520 
nada this is not the call the golden
planning<00:02:25.640> this<00:02:26.060> is<00:02:26.150> called<00:02:26.300> the<00:02:26.420> ASIS<00:02:26.989> of<00:02:27.260> one

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
planning this is called the ASIS of one

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:29.650 
planning this is called the ASIS of one
well<00:02:28.040> because<00:02:28.760> we<00:02:28.880> have<00:02:29.000> to<00:02:29.150> you<00:02:29.239> in<00:02:29.360> three<00:02:29.540> or

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:29.660 
well because we have to you in three or

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:31.150 
well because we have to you in three or
four<00:02:29.870> and<00:02:30.050> you<00:02:30.200> know<00:02:30.290> stuff<00:02:30.500> like<00:02:30.530> that<00:02:30.650> so<00:02:30.950> I

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 
four and you know stuff like that so I

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.280 
four and you know stuff like that so I
went<00:02:31.670> ahead<00:02:31.819> and<00:02:32.060> did<00:02:32.150> him<00:02:32.300> a<00:02:32.360> favor<00:02:32.599> and<00:02:32.750> I

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
went ahead and did him a favor and I

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.320 
went ahead and did him a favor and I
went<00:02:33.680> ahead<00:02:33.860> and<00:02:34.250> not<00:02:34.489> gave<00:02:34.760> him<00:02:34.849> the<00:02:34.970> to<00:02:35.120> start

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 
went ahead and not gave him the to start

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.030 
went ahead and not gave him the to start
because<00:02:35.569> I<00:02:35.599> felt<00:02:35.870> bad<00:02:36.019> for<00:02:36.050> him<00:02:36.319> I<00:02:36.590> was<00:02:36.950> like

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
because I felt bad for him I was like

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:38.710 
because I felt bad for him I was like
you<00:02:37.160> know<00:02:37.250> what<00:02:37.400> using<00:02:37.760> my<00:02:37.849> base<00:02:38.060> and<00:02:38.090> let's<00:02:38.599> go

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
you know what using my base and let's go

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.750 
you know what using my base and let's go
to<00:02:38.780> give<00:02:38.959> him<00:02:39.080> one<00:02:39.230> start<00:02:39.530> and<00:02:40.310> because<00:02:40.730> I

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
to give him one start and because I

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.610 
to give him one start and because I
wanted<00:02:41.150> to<00:02:41.209> lose<00:02:41.510> like<00:02:41.780> seriously<00:02:42.260> I<00:02:42.349> wanted

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
wanted to lose like seriously I wanted

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.580 
wanted to lose like seriously I wanted
to<00:02:42.709> Lutz<00:02:42.920> and<00:02:43.220> I<00:02:43.580> know<00:02:43.640> like<00:02:44.380> you<00:02:45.380> know<00:02:45.410> the

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
to Lutz and I know like you know the

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:47.229 
to Lutz and I know like you know the
weakness<00:02:45.890> is<00:02:46.069> from<00:02:46.280> this<00:02:46.459> base<00:02:46.670> like<00:02:47.030> when<00:02:47.209> I

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:47.239 
weakness is from this base like when I

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:49.479 
weakness is from this base like when I
create<00:02:47.510> my<00:02:47.600> bases<00:02:47.959> I<00:02:48.200> know<00:02:48.620> the<00:02:48.920> witnesses

00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:49.489 
create my bases I know the witnesses

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:51.160 
create my bases I know the witnesses
from<00:02:49.730> every<00:02:50.030> single<00:02:50.180> base<00:02:50.360> I<00:02:50.540> create<00:02:50.840> so<00:02:50.989> if<00:02:51.080> I

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
from every single base I create so if I

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.320 
from every single base I create so if I
take<00:02:51.410> my<00:02:51.470> base<00:02:51.799> don't<00:02:52.580> expect<00:02:52.880> me<00:02:53.030> to<00:02:53.090> you<00:02:53.299> know

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:53.330 
take my base don't expect me to you know

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:55.360 
take my base don't expect me to you know
fail<00:02:53.750> against<00:02:54.140> that<00:02:54.260> base<00:02:54.470> because<00:02:54.830> I<00:02:54.920> know<00:02:54.980> my

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
fail against that base because I know my

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:57.610 
fail against that base because I know my
bases<00:02:55.880> and<00:02:56.150> I<00:02:56.480> went<00:02:56.660> ahead<00:02:56.720> and<00:02:56.810> bit<00:02:57.080> Devin

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
bases and I went ahead and bit Devin

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:59.620 
bases and I went ahead and bit Devin
that<00:02:58.010> did<00:02:58.340> in<00:02:58.430> my<00:02:58.519> favor<00:02:58.730> and<00:02:58.849> I<00:02:59.060> gave<00:02:59.269> him<00:02:59.330> one

00:02:59.620 --> 00:02:59.630 
that did in my favor and I gave him one

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:01.900 
that did in my favor and I gave him one
start<00:02:59.870> only<00:03:00.170> but<00:03:00.769> took<00:03:01.040> all<00:03:01.280> of<00:03:01.340> his<00:03:01.700> dark

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
start only but took all of his dark

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:03.490 
start only but took all of his dark
elixir<00:03:02.060> which<00:03:02.360> was<00:03:02.510> a<00:03:02.569> thousand<00:03:03.200> Douglas

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 
elixir which was a thousand Douglas

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:04.839 
elixir which was a thousand Douglas
which<00:03:03.769> is<00:03:03.950> not<00:03:04.190> so<00:03:04.400> bad

00:03:04.839 --> 00:03:04.849 
which is not so bad

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:06.610 
which is not so bad

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 
so looking at some more rays we have

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:07.809 
so looking at some more rays we have
some<00:03:06.860> more<00:03:07.130> but<00:03:07.310> I'm<00:03:07.400> gonna<00:03:07.519> show<00:03:07.670> you<00:03:07.790> guys

some more but I'm gonna show you guys
all<00:03:08.209> of<00:03:08.299> them<00:03:08.420> we<00:03:09.140> have<00:03:09.260> this<00:03:09.410> one<00:03:09.560> right<00:03:09.590> here

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
all of them we have this one right here

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:13.479 
all of them we have this one right here
I<00:03:09.980> think<00:03:10.459> I<00:03:11.560> think<00:03:12.560> this<00:03:12.680> one<00:03:12.830> was<00:03:12.950> the<00:03:12.980> really

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:13.489 
I think I think this one was the really

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:15.430 
I think I think this one was the really
really<00:03:13.700> close<00:03:13.910> one<00:03:14.060> so<00:03:14.269> look<00:03:14.900> at<00:03:15.049> this<00:03:15.140> fray<00:03:15.349> it

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440 
really close one so look at this fray it

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.020 
really close one so look at this fray it
was<00:03:15.560> really<00:03:15.860> close<00:03:16.160> it<00:03:16.459> was<00:03:16.580> actually<00:03:17.000> a

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 
was really close it was actually a

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:18.699 
was really close it was actually a
pretty<00:03:17.239> bad<00:03:17.570> raid<00:03:17.840> I'm<00:03:18.079> not<00:03:18.230> too<00:03:18.350> sure<00:03:18.530> what<00:03:18.650> I

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:18.709 
pretty bad raid I'm not too sure what I

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:20.470 
pretty bad raid I'm not too sure what I
did<00:03:18.859> wrong<00:03:19.040> but<00:03:19.370> I<00:03:19.549> think<00:03:19.880> I<00:03:20.239> should<00:03:20.299> have

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:20.480 
did wrong but I think I should have

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:21.520 
did wrong but I think I should have
attacked<00:03:20.690> from<00:03:20.810> the<00:03:20.930> bottom<00:03:21.200> because<00:03:21.380> he<00:03:21.440> got

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.530 
attacked from the bottom because he got

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:22.630 
attacked from the bottom because he got
to<00:03:21.650> our<00:03:21.769> defenses<00:03:22.070> wandering<00:03:22.340> here<00:03:22.459> and<00:03:22.549> one

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:22.640 
to our defenses wandering here and one

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:24.729 
to our defenses wandering here and one
right<00:03:22.670> here<00:03:23.000> but<00:03:23.630> I<00:03:23.810> went<00:03:24.019> ahead<00:03:24.109> and<00:03:24.410> go<00:03:24.620> on

00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:24.739 
right here but I went ahead and go on

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:26.979 
right here but I went ahead and go on
from<00:03:25.130> the<00:03:25.280> right<00:03:25.489> side<00:03:25.760> because<00:03:25.940> I<00:03:26.420> thought

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:26.989 
from the right side because I thought

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:28.360 
from the right side because I thought
the<00:03:27.140> dark<00:03:27.290> elixir<00:03:27.410> side<00:03:27.769> was<00:03:27.980> much<00:03:28.190> more

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.370 
the dark elixir side was much more

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:31.270 
the dark elixir side was much more
easier<00:03:28.819> so<00:03:28.970> I've<00:03:29.090> dropped<00:03:29.359> my<00:03:29.540> uh<00:03:30.069> my<00:03:31.069> wall

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:31.280 
easier so I've dropped my uh my wall

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.670 
easier so I've dropped my uh my wall
breakers<00:03:31.670> and<00:03:32.019> the<00:03:33.019> balloons<00:03:33.319> are<00:03:33.410> actually

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680 
breakers and the balloons are actually

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.470 
breakers and the balloons are actually
going<00:03:33.859> to<00:03:34.069> the<00:03:34.220> left<00:03:34.489> side<00:03:34.760> because<00:03:35.000> the<00:03:35.329> air

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:35.480 
going to the left side because the air

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:37.300 
going to the left side because the air
defense<00:03:35.840> again<00:03:36.109> the<00:03:36.739> air<00:03:36.859> defense<00:03:37.100> all<00:03:37.250> the

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:37.310 
defense again the air defense all the

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:38.979 
defense again the air defense all the
way<00:03:37.400> over<00:03:37.549> there<00:03:37.700> and<00:03:37.940> that<00:03:38.359> was<00:03:38.510> the<00:03:38.660> closest

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:38.989 
way over there and that was the closest

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:41.770 
way over there and that was the closest
defense<00:03:39.380> for<00:03:39.709> them<00:03:39.920> so<00:03:40.220> my<00:03:40.730> king<00:03:41.060> does<00:03:41.420> not<00:03:41.600> go

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:41.780 
defense for them so my king does not go

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:43.650 
defense for them so my king does not go
to<00:03:41.840> the<00:03:42.019> dark<00:03:42.230> elixir<00:03:42.410> and<00:03:42.829> my<00:03:43.040> archers

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:46.579

looking pretty good my meetings a lot
done<00:05:09.680> to<00:05:09.800> the<00:05:09.860> dark<00:05:09.979> elixir<00:05:10.130> so<00:05:10.460> we're

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:10.610 
done to the dark elixir so we're

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:11.559 
done to the dark elixir so we're
definitely<00:05:10.759> gonna<00:05:10.970> get<00:05:11.120> that<00:05:11.240> dark<00:05:11.389> elixir

00:05:11.559 --> 00:05:11.569 
definitely gonna get that dark elixir

00:05:11.569 --> 00:05:13.899 
definitely gonna get that dark elixir
and<00:05:12.110> now<00:05:12.770> I'm<00:05:13.190> gonna<00:05:13.310> go<00:05:13.460> ahead<00:05:13.520> and<00:05:13.610> heal<00:05:13.880> my

00:05:13.899 --> 00:05:13.909 
and now I'm gonna go ahead and heal my

00:05:13.909 --> 00:05:15.430 
and now I'm gonna go ahead and heal my
balloons<00:05:14.539> because<00:05:14.750> I<00:05:14.870> think<00:05:15.169> that<00:05:15.259> they<00:05:15.349> can

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:15.440 
balloons because I think that they can

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:17.950 
balloons because I think that they can
survive<00:05:15.770> some<00:05:16.009> more<00:05:16.250> and<00:05:16.610> that<00:05:17.599> should<00:05:17.630> be<00:05:17.900> it

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:17.960 
survive some more and that should be it
