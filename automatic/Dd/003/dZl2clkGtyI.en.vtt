00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.429 
Indiana the pets that we have for sale
we<00:00:29.970> pretty<00:00:30.180> much<00:00:30.240> carry<00:00:30.660> a<00:00:30.750> broad<00:00:31.199> selection

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
we pretty much carry a broad selection

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.770 
we pretty much carry a broad selection
of<00:00:31.859> the<00:00:32.009> animals<00:00:32.369> I<00:00:32.610> would<00:00:32.940> say<00:00:33.059> our<00:00:33.090> focus<00:00:33.630> is

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
of the animals I would say our focus is

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.229 
of the animals I would say our focus is
primarily<00:00:34.340> would<00:00:35.340> be<00:00:35.460> aquatic<00:00:35.970> would<00:00:36.120> be

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
primarily would be aquatic would be

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.650 
primarily would be aquatic would be
first<00:00:36.829> fresh<00:00:37.829> and<00:00:38.010> saltwater<00:00:38.250> fish<00:00:38.640> and<00:00:39.390> then

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
first fresh and saltwater fish and then

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.270 
first fresh and saltwater fish and then
after<00:00:39.989> that<00:00:40.110> I<00:00:40.170> think<00:00:40.440> it<00:00:40.530> would<00:00:40.620> be<00:00:40.649> Birds<00:00:41.010> and

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
after that I think it would be Birds and

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.790 
after that I think it would be Birds and
then<00:00:41.370> reptiles<00:00:41.820> we<00:00:42.660> try<00:00:42.840> to<00:00:42.899> focus<00:00:43.110> on<00:00:43.469> some<00:00:43.680> of

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
then reptiles we try to focus on some of

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.709 
then reptiles we try to focus on some of
the<00:00:43.890> real<00:00:44.070> basic<00:00:44.550> almost<00:00:44.879> family<00:00:45.090> friendly

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
the real basic almost family friendly

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.139 
the real basic almost family friendly
type<00:00:45.930> of<00:00:46.079> pets<00:00:46.290> if<00:00:46.469> you<00:00:46.620> will<00:00:46.829> in<00:00:47.430> addition<00:00:47.790> we

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
type of pets if you will in addition we

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:49.910 
type of pets if you will in addition we
have<00:00:48.300> some<00:00:48.719> of<00:00:48.840> the<00:00:48.870> bigger<00:00:49.170> macaws<00:00:49.530> and

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
have some of the bigger macaws and

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.520 
have some of the bigger macaws and
cockatoos<00:00:50.489> but<00:00:50.730> we<00:00:51.450> also<00:00:51.629> carry<00:00:52.050> I<00:00:52.110> think<00:00:52.379> are

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
cockatoos but we also carry I think are

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.170 
cockatoos but we also carry I think are
probably<00:00:52.920> our<00:00:53.160> most<00:00:53.190> popular<00:00:53.550> would<00:00:53.940> have<00:00:54.090> to

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
probably our most popular would have to

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.760 
probably our most popular would have to
be<00:00:54.300> our<00:00:54.390> parakeets<00:00:54.870> and<00:00:55.020> our<00:00:55.200> hand<00:00:55.530> fed

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
be our parakeets and our hand fed

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.010 
be our parakeets and our hand fed

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
don't carry too many snakes that we just

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.940 
don't carry too many snakes that we just
carry<00:01:08.609> some<00:01:08.850> of<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:09.090> more<00:01:09.389> popular<00:01:09.950> snakes

carry some of the more popular snakes

00:01:33.949 --> 00:01:33.959 
are all freshwater fish we try to carry

00:01:33.959 --> 00:01:36.889

a large variety both a community type of

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:40.160 
a large variety both a community type of
fish<00:01:37.139> and<00:01:37.409> also<00:01:38.310> some<00:01:38.490> of<00:01:38.520> the<00:01:38.609> more<00:01:38.849> exotics

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
fish and also some of the more exotics

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.280 
fish and also some of the more exotics
in<00:01:40.740> our<00:01:40.860> saltwater<00:01:41.189> fish<00:01:41.580> we<00:01:41.729> carry<00:01:42.000> both

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:42.290 
in our saltwater fish we carry both

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:45.679 
in our saltwater fish we carry both
invertebrates<00:01:43.290> such<00:01:43.619> as<00:01:44.040> corals<00:01:44.520> and<00:01:44.759> sea

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
invertebrates such as corals and sea

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.080 
invertebrates such as corals and sea
anemones<00:01:46.170> starfish<00:01:46.860> and<00:01:47.130> we<00:01:47.280> also<00:01:47.430> carry<00:01:47.790> fish

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
anemones starfish and we also carry fish

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.410 
anemones starfish and we also carry fish
too<00:01:49.130> there<00:01:50.130> is<00:01:50.280> there<00:01:50.610> is<00:01:50.759> an<00:01:50.939> art<00:01:51.119> and<00:01:51.299> a

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
too there is there is an art and a

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.210 
too there is there is an art and a
science<00:01:51.450> taking<00:01:52.290> it<00:01:52.409> taking<00:01:52.710> care<00:01:53.040> of<00:01:53.070> an

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
science taking it taking care of an

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.910 
science taking it taking care of an
aquarium<00:01:53.700> and<00:01:54.299> I<00:01:54.570> think<00:01:54.990> that<00:01:55.229> it<00:01:55.500> helps<00:01:55.799> to

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
aquarium and I think that it helps to

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.370 
aquarium and I think that it helps to
have<00:01:55.950> a<00:01:56.220> good<00:01:56.580> expert<00:01:57.180> staff<00:01:57.450> and<00:01:57.899> that's

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
have a good expert staff and that's

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.630 
have a good expert staff and that's
where<00:01:58.590> I<00:01:58.619> think<00:01:58.920> one<00:01:59.100> of<00:01:59.130> the<00:01:59.280> areas<00:01:59.610> that

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
where I think one of the areas that

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.249 
where I think one of the areas that
might<00:01:59.909> set<00:02:00.149> us<00:02:00.330> apart<00:02:00.509> from<00:02:00.750> from<00:02:01.170> the

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
might set us apart from from the

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:05.420 
might set us apart from from the
competition<00:02:02.750> it<00:02:03.750> if<00:02:04.470> there<00:02:04.710> was<00:02:04.830> a<00:02:04.860> fish<00:02:05.189> that

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
competition it if there was a fish that

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.730 
competition it if there was a fish that
you<00:02:06.119> were<00:02:06.270> looking<00:02:06.630> for<00:02:06.899> that<00:02:07.439> would<00:02:07.590> be

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
you were looking for that would be

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.889 
you were looking for that would be
available<00:02:07.860> we<00:02:08.489> could<00:02:08.729> get<00:02:09.030> that<00:02:09.209> if<00:02:09.690> they<00:02:09.840> were

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
available we could get that if they were

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.600 
available we could get that if they were
looking<00:02:10.110> for<00:02:10.319> something<00:02:10.590> yes<00:02:11.130> we<00:02:11.400> have

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
sources that we could locate down some

exotic more Toro stingray or whatever

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:18.770 
exotic more Toro stingray or whatever
that<00:02:17.489> might<00:02:17.670> be<00:02:17.730> that<00:02:18.030> wouldn't<00:02:18.360> be<00:02:18.450> a<00:02:18.480> problem

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
that might be that wouldn't be a problem

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.170 
that might be that wouldn't be a problem
to<00:02:19.019> do<00:02:19.170> that<00:02:19.350> there<00:02:19.799> are<00:02:19.980> there<00:02:20.549> are<00:02:20.580> fish<00:02:21.150> that

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
to do that there are there are fish that

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.600 
to do that there are there are fish that
we<00:02:21.480> don't<00:02:21.600> carry<00:02:21.959> for<00:02:22.680> a<00:02:22.709> reason<00:02:23.250> there<00:02:23.430> are<00:02:23.549> a

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
we don't carry for a reason there are a

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.479 
we don't carry for a reason there are a
lot<00:02:23.850> of<00:02:23.880> fish<00:02:24.239> that<00:02:24.569> don't<00:02:25.440> survive<00:02:26.069> well<00:02:26.370> in

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:26.489 
lot of fish that don't survive well in

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:28.340 
lot of fish that don't survive well in
captivity<00:02:26.670> I<00:02:27.269> think<00:02:27.600> in<00:02:27.750> that<00:02:27.870> point<00:02:28.140> it's

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
captivity I think in that point it's

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:31.550 
captivity I think in that point it's
more<00:02:28.560> salt<00:02:28.799> water<00:02:28.980> it<00:02:29.280> just<00:02:30.019> it<00:02:31.019> just<00:02:31.170> doesn't

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
more salt water it just it just doesn't

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.830 
more salt water it just it just doesn't
sit<00:02:31.709> well<00:02:31.769> with<00:02:31.950> me<00:02:32.160> to<00:02:32.489> take<00:02:32.670> it<00:02:32.700> or<00:02:32.970> an<00:02:33.209> animal

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
out of the ocean that that might be

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:39.199 
out of the ocean that that might be
doomed<00:02:36.180> in<00:02:36.600> six<00:02:36.930> months<00:02:37.080> that<00:02:37.709> this<00:02:38.209> marvelous

the<00:02:45.480> the<00:02:45.810> aspect<00:02:46.290> of<00:02:46.410> having<00:02:46.739> pets<00:02:47.010> being<00:02:47.579> part

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
the the aspect of having pets being part

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:49.880 
the the aspect of having pets being part
of<00:02:47.910> the<00:02:48.000> family<00:02:48.269> I<00:02:48.450> whether<00:02:48.989> it<00:02:49.170> be<00:02:49.260> a<00:02:49.290> dog<00:02:49.590> or<00:02:49.859> a

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
of the family I whether it be a dog or a

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:51.860 
of the family I whether it be a dog or a
cast<00:02:50.220> they<00:02:50.730> do<00:02:50.790> become<00:02:51.239> part<00:02:51.480> of<00:02:51.540> the<00:02:51.600> family

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
cast they do become part of the family

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.039 
cast they do become part of the family
and<00:02:52.140> there<00:02:52.739> is<00:02:52.920> that<00:02:53.130> idea<00:02:53.519> that<00:02:53.579> the<00:02:54.150> pet<00:02:54.359> just

00:02:55.039 --> 00:02:55.049 
and there is that idea that the pet just

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:57.080 
and there is that idea that the pet just
really<00:02:55.260> doesn't<00:02:55.410> ask<00:02:55.769> for<00:02:55.890> a<00:02:56.100> lot<00:02:56.160> other<00:02:56.970> than

really doesn't ask for a lot other than
