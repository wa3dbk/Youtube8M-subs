00:00:09.429 --> 00:00:15.019
 hi to all forever so we are not here with samsung galaxy s2 now let's see 

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:17.980
 how it behaves in management. 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:23.430
 of the infamous eighty-year-old of you then those problem that manifests itself there 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.940
 causing the telephone signal to be lost completely 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.669
 and now he loves me by turning phone as you can see in full with 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:36.600
 our hands things to see yes the telephone signal is maintained 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.990
 he gets lost 

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:41.990
 obviously text we will last about 3 minutes 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:47.000
 also because going further would not have particular six sepe become boring 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
 also for us to stay in this position 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.810
 as you can see we are about halfway through the initial telephone field 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.810
 now we are treated to 4 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.330
 we will continue coleman testing this position for another couple of minutes 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:18.360
 then we'll see 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:24.920
 you are and you cannot. continue with the use of the telephone or the 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.060
 signal the fans. link 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.590
 the fact of having themes a connection to the operator network allows you 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.549
 obviously to make phone calls and send messages to receive e-mail messages and 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:36.810
 whatever 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.130
 there are even more expensive phones. of this sanson that have the defect 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:45.880
 finally that you go sideways in some strange way I'm going to get 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.270
 just the connection 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.370
 specifically we consider prataccio 4 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:55.930
 indicator can be found at the top right of the galaxy s2 screen 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.490
 we will continue to be in this position for another minute after 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.249
 which we abandon and this text is 

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:10.759
 being 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:15.149
 the behavior so far has kept from this galaxy s2 to seem that finally 

00:02:15.149 --> 00:02:16.249
 it's all right 

00:02:16.249 --> 00:02:20.269
 here niece castravelli substance a little as she likes this phone so much vi 

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:21.629
 door anyway 

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:25.049
 to make phone calls and send messages 1110 

00:02:28.469 --> 00:02:33.659
 the fact of having such a good signal so good signal retention 

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:35.190
 precise telephone presses 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.850
 involves the fact that even the moments when you find yourself with a poor marine 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:43.629
 telephone field can happen kg subscribers in the cellar 

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:50.279
 and in the mountains heroes still allows you to preserve the possibility 

00:02:50.279 --> 00:02:54.980
 to make phone calls for example if you need to make an emergency call 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:59.990
 very important thing to do with simple mail handling 

00:03:05.219 --> 00:03:09.760
 the witness I would say we can do it so I don't think there's anything else 

00:03:09.759 --> 00:03:13.859
 necessary to show you the test and therefore it is absolutely passed 

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:19.409
 as you can see and most of the time to kill we were treated on 420 4 up 

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:20.309
 4 

00:03:20.309 --> 00:03:25.879
 galaxy s2 therefore exceeds for this text is my name not to lose for all

00:03:27.469 --> 00:03:30.849
 in a more brilliant way and therefore your state much to manage for 

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:31.730
 example 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:35.810
 a significant amount of sms the most arrived argentina we made a 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:36.429
 video 

00:03:36.429 --> 00:03:40.879
 and that they called me reel sense theme for we can continue to 

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:45.709
 use it even in conditions not exactly of bari as we have just 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:47.319
