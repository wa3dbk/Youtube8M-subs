sure if I'm crazy about it this one's
kind<00:00:32.340> of<00:00:32.430> interesting<00:00:33.090> though<00:00:34.100> it's<00:00:35.100> can

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:36.380 
kind of interesting though it's can

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:39.619 
kind of interesting though it's can
actually<00:00:37.380> underneath<00:00:37.890> the<00:00:38.640> seat<00:00:38.940> and<00:00:38.969> lock<00:00:39.360> in

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
actually underneath the seat and lock in

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.810 
actually underneath the seat and lock in
so<00:00:39.840> it's<00:00:39.930> like<00:00:40.110> she<00:00:40.260> locked<00:00:40.559> to<00:00:40.739> the<00:00:40.770> plate<00:00:41.100> you

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
so it's like she locked to the plate you

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:47.330 
so it's like she locked to the plate you
can<00:00:42.000> see<00:00:42.210> that<00:00:42.450> there<00:00:42.750> okay<00:00:45.680> then<00:00:46.680> it's<00:00:46.920> bungee

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
can see that there okay then it's bungee

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.650 
can see that there okay then it's bungee
on<00:00:47.489> to<00:00:47.700> make<00:00:47.850> it<00:00:47.969> a<00:00:48.030> little<00:00:48.120> bit<00:00:48.329> stronger<00:00:49.640> it's

zero<00:01:30.540> gravity<00:01:30.869> Turing<00:01:31.619> windscreen<00:01:32.360> it<00:01:33.360> looks

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
zero gravity Turing windscreen it looks

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.749 
zero gravity Turing windscreen it looks
pretty<00:01:33.689> nice<00:01:33.930> actually<00:01:34.229> that's<00:01:35.220> about<00:01:35.460> four

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
pretty nice actually that's about four

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.100 
pretty nice actually that's about four
inches<00:01:35.970> higher<00:01:36.210> than<00:01:36.240> the<00:01:36.570> stock<00:01:36.840> windscreen

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
inches higher than the stock windscreen

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.179 
inches higher than the stock windscreen
and<00:01:37.820> this<00:01:38.820> takes<00:01:39.090> the<00:01:39.869> wind<00:01:40.140> and<00:01:40.860> unless<00:01:41.100> you

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
and this takes the wind and unless you

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:44.480 
and this takes the wind and unless you
went<00:01:41.340> to<00:01:41.490> a<00:01:41.520> real<00:01:41.820> serious<00:01:42.299> tuck<00:01:42.920> and<00:01:43.920> I'm<00:01:44.040> kind

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
went to a real serious tuck and I'm kind

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.179 
went to a real serious tuck and I'm kind
of<00:01:44.630> too<00:01:45.630> old<00:01:45.840> to<00:01:46.049> be<00:01:46.110> riding<00:01:46.530> the<00:01:46.710> tough<00:01:46.950> for

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
of too old to be riding the tough for

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.469 
of too old to be riding the tough for
that<00:01:47.369> long<00:01:49.700> the<00:01:50.700> wind<00:01:50.909> would<00:01:51.030> hit<00:01:51.180> me<00:01:51.270> right<00:01:51.420> in

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
that long the wind would hit me right in

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.410 
that long the wind would hit me right in
the<00:01:51.600> throat<00:01:51.890> basically<00:01:53.119> when<00:01:54.119> you're<00:01:54.240> getting

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
the throat basically when you're getting

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.200 
the throat basically when you're getting
up<00:01:54.600> to<00:01:54.750> highway<00:01:54.930> speed<00:01:55.470> so<00:01:55.829> this<00:01:56.130> brings<00:01:57.000> the

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
up to highway speed so this brings the

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.679 
up to highway speed so this brings the
wind<00:01:57.509> up<00:01:57.750> up<00:01:58.350> and<00:01:58.820> more<00:01:59.820> directed<00:02:00.450> towards

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
wind up up and more directed towards

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.530 
wind up up and more directed towards
your<00:02:00.810> helmet<00:02:01.200> which<00:02:01.350> is<00:02:01.500> fine<00:02:01.770> as<00:02:01.979> the<00:02:02.070> helmets

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:02.540 
your helmet which is fine as the helmets

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:06.520 
your helmet which is fine as the helmets
built<00:02:03.540> in<00:02:03.689> a<00:02:03.750> wind<00:02:04.020> tunnel<00:02:04.110> and<00:02:04.610> so<00:02:05.610> it

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
built in a wind tunnel and so it

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.650 
built in a wind tunnel and so it
takes<00:02:07.280> their<00:02:07.549> around<00:02:07.850> it<00:02:08.000> just<00:02:08.209> fine<00:02:08.390> so<00:02:08.569> it's

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 
takes their around it just fine so it's

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.809 
takes their around it just fine so it's
basically<00:02:08.840> now<00:02:09.830> it's<00:02:09.979> like<00:02:10.069> writing<00:02:10.340> with<00:02:10.580> in

00:02:10.809 --> 00:02:10.819 
basically now it's like writing with in

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:13.199 
basically now it's like writing with in
a<00:02:10.940> car<00:02:11.240> with<00:02:11.450> your<00:02:11.600> windows<00:02:11.990> down<00:02:12.260> rather<00:02:12.980> than

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:13.209 
a car with your windows down rather than

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:15.880 
a car with your windows down rather than
having<00:02:14.209> a<00:02:14.540> stream<00:02:14.840> of<00:02:14.870> air<00:02:15.110> director<00:02:15.590> right<00:02:15.740> at

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
having a stream of air director right at

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:17.350 
having a stream of air director right at
your<00:02:16.010> throat<00:02:16.340> which<00:02:16.700> after<00:02:17.000> a<00:02:17.030> while<00:02:17.150> it<00:02:17.270> gets

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
your throat which after a while it gets

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.400 
your throat which after a while it gets
pretty<00:02:17.569> tiring<00:02:18.910> I<00:02:19.990> think<00:02:20.990> it's<00:02:21.080> acrylic

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
pretty tiring I think it's acrylic

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:24.670 
pretty tiring I think it's acrylic
pretty<00:02:22.400> nicely<00:02:22.670> made<00:02:23.170> the<00:02:24.170> other<00:02:24.290> thing<00:02:24.530> I've

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
pretty nicely made the other thing I've

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.010 
pretty nicely made the other thing I've
done<00:02:24.709> is<00:02:25.069> put<00:02:25.310> on<00:02:25.400> a<00:02:25.430> ram<00:02:25.760> mount<00:02:26.120> if<00:02:26.660> you<00:02:26.840> can

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:27.020 
done is put on a ram mount if you can

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:33.960 
done is put on a ram mount if you can
see<00:02:27.319> it<00:02:27.350> here<00:02:29.470> it<00:02:30.470> goes<00:02:30.739> into<00:02:31.810> into<00:02:32.810> the<00:02:32.900> forks

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
see it here it goes into into the forks

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:39.490 
see it here it goes into into the forks
and<00:02:35.920> it's<00:02:36.920> it's<00:02:37.160> super<00:02:37.580> sturdy<00:02:37.819> and<00:02:38.180> there's<00:02:39.110> a

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
and it's it's super sturdy and there's a

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.590 
and it's it's super sturdy and there's a
couple<00:02:40.489> different<00:02:40.700> mounts<00:02:41.180> you<00:02:41.269> go<00:02:41.420> this

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:41.600 
couple different mounts you go this

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:45.280 
couple different mounts you go this
one's<00:02:41.840> a<00:02:41.900> GPS<00:02:42.380> this<00:02:42.590> GPS<00:02:43.630> happens<00:02:44.630> to<00:02:44.810> be<00:02:44.959> wired

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
one's a GPS this GPS happens to be wired

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.880 
one's a GPS this GPS happens to be wired
now<00:02:45.769> to<00:02:46.730> the<00:02:46.850> bike<00:02:47.060> so<00:02:47.570> there's<00:02:48.530> a<00:02:48.620> wiring

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
now to the bike so there's a wiring

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.220 
now to the bike so there's a wiring
harness<00:02:49.519> that's<00:02:49.730> not<00:02:50.510> going<00:02:50.600> to<00:02:50.720> take<00:02:50.840> my<00:02:50.989> seat

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
harness that's not going to take my seat

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:53.020 
harness that's not going to take my seat
off<00:02:51.440> but<00:02:51.680> the<00:02:51.860> wiring<00:02:52.190> harness<00:02:52.550> is<00:02:52.670> underneath

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
off but the wiring harness is underneath

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:58.750 
off but the wiring harness is underneath
the<00:02:53.090> seat<00:02:53.480> and<00:02:55.690> comes<00:02:56.690> out<00:02:56.900> right<00:02:57.260> here<00:02:57.769> you

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 
the seat and comes out right here you

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.790 
the seat and comes out right here you
can<00:02:58.940> see<00:02:59.180> that<00:02:59.390> so<00:02:59.720> the<00:02:59.840> wiring<00:03:00.230> harness<00:03:00.590> comes

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:00.800 
can see that so the wiring harness comes

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:07.800 
can see that so the wiring harness comes
to<00:03:01.010> here<00:03:01.430> and<00:03:01.819> then<00:03:02.680> there's<00:03:03.680> an<00:03:03.860> adapter<00:03:04.810> by<00:03:06.069> I

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
to here and then there's an adapter by I

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:09.940 
to here and then there's an adapter by I

this<00:03:20.840> adapter<00:03:21.470> has<00:03:21.590> a<00:03:21.650> fuse<00:03:22.100> in<00:03:22.130> it<00:03:22.430> so<00:03:22.700> it<00:03:22.820> will

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:22.910 
this adapter has a fuse in it so it will

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:24.640 
this adapter has a fuse in it so it will
convert<00:03:23.299> the<00:03:23.480> power<00:03:23.720> down<00:03:24.200> to<00:03:24.380> the<00:03:24.500> right

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 
convert the power down to the right

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:27.390
