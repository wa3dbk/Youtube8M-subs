this is a resource of limited mode where

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:22.930 
this is a resource of limited mode where
you<00:03:21.049> need<00:03:21.200> to<00:03:21.319> fight<00:03:21.680> for<00:03:21.709> control<00:03:22.280> of<00:03:22.310> weapon

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:22.940 
you need to fight for control of weapon

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:25.449 
you need to fight for control of weapon
drops<00:03:23.180> to<00:03:23.329> gain<00:03:23.510> superiority<00:03:24.160> this<00:03:25.160> sounds

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:25.459 
drops to gain superiority this sounds

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:26.770 
drops to gain superiority this sounds
interesting<00:03:25.760> this<00:03:26.120> sounds<00:03:26.419> like<00:03:26.599> you

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:26.780 
interesting this sounds like you

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:29.199 
interesting this sounds like you
actually<00:03:26.900> have<00:03:27.139> to<00:03:27.530> start<00:03:28.400> off<00:03:28.549> with<00:03:28.730> nothing

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:29.209 
actually have to start off with nothing

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:31.509 
actually have to start off with nothing
I'm<00:03:30.169> assuming<00:03:30.680> maybe<00:03:30.859> everyone<00:03:31.160> starts<00:03:31.400> off

00:03:31.509 --> 00:03:31.519 
I'm assuming maybe everyone starts off

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:33.640 
I'm assuming maybe everyone starts off
with<00:03:31.639> just<00:03:31.720> their<00:03:32.720> knife<00:03:32.959> the<00:03:33.139> combat<00:03:33.500> knife

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650 
with just their knife the combat knife

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:35.229 
with just their knife the combat knife
and<00:03:33.829> it<00:03:33.889> has<00:03:34.010> the<00:03:34.099> pickup<00:03:34.459> weapon<00:03:34.790> drops<00:03:35.030> and

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:35.239 
and it has the pickup weapon drops and

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:38.050 
and it has the pickup weapon drops and
sort<00:03:35.599> of<00:03:35.630> battle<00:03:36.079> it<00:03:36.139> out<00:03:36.549> sounds<00:03:37.549> similar<00:03:37.790> in

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:38.060 
sort of battle it out sounds similar in

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:39.849 
sort of battle it out sounds similar in
a<00:03:38.150> way<00:03:38.180> to<00:03:38.359> sort<00:03:38.840> of<00:03:38.959> having<00:03:39.169> effective<00:03:39.680> work

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:39.859 
a way to sort of having effective work

00:03:39.859 --> 00:03:41.379 
a way to sort of having effective work
maybe<00:03:40.099> a<00:03:40.220> bit<00:03:40.340> more<00:03:40.489> of<00:03:40.549> a<00:03:40.609> fun<00:03:40.849> mode<00:03:41.120> rather

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:41.389 
maybe a bit more of a fun mode rather

00:03:41.389 --> 00:03:43.420 
maybe a bit more of a fun mode rather
than<00:03:41.510> the<00:03:41.599> serious<00:03:42.049> mode<00:03:42.319> but<00:03:43.099> it's<00:03:43.220> awesome

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.430 
than the serious mode but it's awesome

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:45.129 
than the serious mode but it's awesome
that<00:03:43.639> all<00:03:43.880> these<00:03:44.090> new<00:03:44.269> modes<00:03:44.480> being<00:03:44.690> added

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:45.139 
that all these new modes being added

into the game we also have search and

00:03:47.419 --> 00:03:49.780 
into the game we also have search and
rescue<00:03:47.900> another<00:03:48.380> mode<00:03:48.620> which<00:03:48.829> showed<00:03:49.579> a

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:49.790 
rescue another mode which showed a

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:51.159 
rescue another mode which showed a
little<00:03:50.239> bit<00:03:50.419> of<00:03:50.569> gameplay<00:03:50.750> of<00:03:50.989> it's

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:51.169 
little bit of gameplay of it's

00:03:51.169 --> 00:03:51.759 
little bit of gameplay of it's
essentially<00:03:51.530> the<00:03:51.590> same<00:03:51.620> a

00:03:51.759 --> 00:03:51.769

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:53.060 
search-and-destroy so when you die you

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:55.120 
search-and-destroy so when you die you
