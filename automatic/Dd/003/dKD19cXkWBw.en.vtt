00:00:03.969 --> 00:00:03.979 
hi everyone and welcome to biology

00:00:03.979 --> 00:00:07.210 
hi everyone and welcome to biology
professor<00:00:04.910> today<00:00:05.870> I<00:00:06.019> want<00:00:06.470> to<00:00:06.559> talk<00:00:06.800> about

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:07.220 
professor today I want to talk about

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:10.170 
professor today I want to talk about
genetic<00:00:07.760> recombination<00:00:08.029> in<00:00:08.750> bacteria

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:10.180 
genetic recombination in bacteria

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:13.090 
genetic recombination in bacteria
bacterial<00:00:11.180> cells<00:00:11.510> are<00:00:11.840> pretty<00:00:12.500> cool<00:00:12.860> because

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:13.100 
bacterial cells are pretty cool because

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:16.990 
bacterial cells are pretty cool because
they<00:00:13.400> have<00:00:13.610> the<00:00:13.790> ability<00:00:13.880> to<00:00:14.599> take<00:00:14.990> up<00:00:16.000> foreign

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:17.000 
they have the ability to take up foreign

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.339 
they have the ability to take up foreign
DNA<00:00:17.689> and<00:00:18.999> actually<00:00:20.050> incorporate<00:00:21.050> it<00:00:21.169> into

00:00:21.339 --> 00:00:21.349 
DNA and actually incorporate it into

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:24.179 
DNA and actually incorporate it into
their<00:00:21.529> own<00:00:21.589> genetic<00:00:22.159> profile<00:00:22.669> in<00:00:23.359> order<00:00:23.570> to

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:24.189 
their own genetic profile in order to

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:27.059 
their own genetic profile in order to
make<00:00:25.189> the<00:00:25.339> protein<00:00:25.789> that<00:00:26.150> foreign<00:00:26.839> DNA

00:00:27.059 --> 00:00:27.069 
make the protein that foreign DNA

00:00:27.069 --> 00:00:30.399 
make the protein that foreign DNA
encoded<00:00:28.069> or<00:00:28.279> this<00:00:28.999> can<00:00:29.149> give<00:00:29.300> bacterial<00:00:29.989> cells

00:00:30.399 --> 00:00:30.409 
encoded or this can give bacterial cells

00:00:30.409 --> 00:00:33.040 
encoded or this can give bacterial cells
extra<00:00:31.369> functionality<00:00:32.090> for<00:00:32.480> example<00:00:32.540> they

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:33.050 
extra functionality for example they

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:38.529 
extra functionality for example they
might<00:00:33.290> gain<00:00:33.859> new<00:00:34.430> DNA<00:00:34.850> that<00:00:35.210> has<00:00:36.969> the<00:00:37.969> codes

00:00:38.529 --> 00:00:38.539 
might gain new DNA that has the codes

00:00:38.539 --> 00:00:40.810 
might gain new DNA that has the codes
for<00:00:38.930> toxins<00:00:39.469> so<00:00:39.739> that<00:00:39.890> codes<00:00:40.070> for<00:00:40.160> virulence

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:40.820 
for toxins so that codes for virulence

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:43.150 
for toxins so that codes for virulence
factors<00:00:41.390> with<00:00:41.660> it<00:00:41.780> codes<00:00:42.050> for<00:00:42.260> antibiotic

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:43.160 
factors with it codes for antibiotic

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.189 
factors with it codes for antibiotic
resistance<00:00:43.670> and<00:00:43.940> the<00:00:44.359> bacterial<00:00:44.840> cell<00:00:45.050> can

00:00:45.189 --> 00:00:45.199 
resistance and the bacterial cell can

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:48.849 
resistance and the bacterial cell can
actually<00:00:45.469> gain<00:00:45.850> new<00:00:47.500> functionality<00:00:48.500> through

00:00:48.849 --> 00:00:48.859 
actually gain new functionality through

00:00:48.859 --> 00:00:51.099 
actually gain new functionality through
this<00:00:49.070> way<00:00:49.329> there<00:00:50.329> are<00:00:50.359> three<00:00:50.989> different

00:00:51.099 --> 00:00:51.109 
this way there are three different

00:00:51.109 --> 00:00:54.279 
this way there are three different
mechanisms<00:00:51.890> by<00:00:52.730> which<00:00:52.760> bacteria<00:00:53.179> can<00:00:53.870> obtain

00:00:54.279 --> 00:00:54.289 
mechanisms by which bacteria can obtain

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:58.319 
mechanisms by which bacteria can obtain
foreign<00:00:55.100> DNA<00:00:55.539> these<00:00:56.539> are<00:00:56.859> transformations

00:00:58.319 --> 00:00:58.329 
foreign DNA these are transformations

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:01.450 
foreign DNA these are transformations
conjugation<00:00:59.329> and<00:00:59.570> transduction<00:01:00.409> I<00:01:00.890> have

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:01.460 
conjugation and transduction I have

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:03.369 
conjugation and transduction I have
videos<00:01:01.879> on<00:01:01.909> all<00:01:02.300> three<00:01:02.510> of<00:01:02.539> these<00:01:02.719> mechanisms

00:01:03.369 --> 00:01:03.379 
videos on all three of these mechanisms

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:06.210 
videos on all three of these mechanisms
but<00:01:04.159> today<00:01:04.519> let's<00:01:04.820> talk<00:01:05.059> about<00:01:05.120> first<00:01:05.660> one

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:06.220 
but today let's talk about first one

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:12.070 
but today let's talk about first one
transformation<00:01:09.970> transformation<00:01:10.970> is<00:01:11.210> when<00:01:11.690> a

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:12.080 
transformation transformation is when a

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.690 
transformation transformation is when a
bacterial<00:01:12.770> cell<00:01:12.880> takes<00:01:13.880> up<00:01:14.320> foreign<00:01:15.320> DNA<00:01:15.700> from

of these types of bacteria so now let's
look<00:02:11.819> at<00:02:11.910> this<00:02:12.060> mechanism<00:02:12.390> in<00:02:12.900> a<00:02:13.019> little<00:02:13.230> more

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:13.349 
look at this mechanism in a little more

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:18.309 
look at this mechanism in a little more

bacterial cell
this<00:02:22.110> here<00:02:22.680> is<00:02:22.890> its<00:02:23.400> chromosomal<00:02:24.150> DNA<00:02:31.730> so<00:02:32.730> this

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
this here is its chromosomal DNA so this

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.960 
this here is its chromosomal DNA so this
is<00:02:33.060> the<00:02:33.180> DNA<00:02:33.510> that<00:02:33.780> it<00:02:33.930> has<00:02:34.110> had<00:02:34.700> since<00:02:35.700> it<00:02:35.819> was

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
is the DNA that it has had since it was

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.050 
is the DNA that it has had since it was
produced<00:02:36.390> by<00:02:36.599> replication<00:02:37.530> of<00:02:38.060> previous

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.509 
are now just floating around the
environment<00:03:12.139> the<00:03:13.139> recipient<00:03:13.680> bacterial<00:03:14.190> cell

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:14.519 
environment the recipient bacterial cell

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:20.839 
environment the recipient bacterial cell
can<00:03:14.910> actually<00:03:15.540> take<00:03:15.930> this<00:03:16.470> DNA<00:03:19.609> across<00:03:20.609> its

00:03:20.839 --> 00:03:20.849 
can actually take this DNA across its

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:23.240 
can actually take this DNA across its
plasma<00:03:21.060> membrane<00:03:21.690> so<00:03:22.319> that<00:03:22.440> now<00:03:22.590> this<00:03:22.769> DNA<00:03:23.220> and

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
plasma membrane so that now this DNA and

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.210 
plasma membrane so that now this DNA and
inside<00:03:23.970> the<00:03:24.180> cell<00:03:24.680> then<00:03:25.680> through<00:03:26.130> the<00:03:26.190> process

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
inside the cell then through the process

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:37.520 
inside the cell then through the process
of<00:03:26.819> recombination

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:42.330 

the<00:03:39.330> bacterial<00:03:40.330> cell<00:03:40.630> has<00:03:41.020> its<00:03:41.440> chromosomal

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340 
the bacterial cell has its chromosomal

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:45.930 
the bacterial cell has its chromosomal
DNA<00:03:42.700> that<00:03:43.480> has<00:03:43.830> recombined<00:03:44.830> with<00:03:45.280> this

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:45.940 
DNA that has recombined with this

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:49.080 
DNA that has recombined with this
foreign<00:03:46.450> DNA<00:03:46.690> so<00:03:47.620> the<00:03:47.860> foreign<00:03:48.250> DNA<00:03:48.430> has<00:03:48.850> now

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:49.090 
foreign DNA so the foreign DNA has now

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:52.700 
foreign DNA so the foreign DNA has now
been<00:03:49.890> integrated<00:03:50.890> into<00:03:51.190> the<00:03:51.910> chromosome

this foreign DNA is also going to be
broken<00:04:09.580> down<00:04:10.110> and<00:04:11.110> now<00:04:11.350> we<00:04:11.410> have<00:04:11.860> this

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:12.330 
broken down and now we have this

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:15.330 
broken down and now we have this
genetically<00:04:13.330> transformed<00:04:14.050> bacterial<00:04:15.040> cell

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:15.340

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:18.730 
this new DNA that's taken up can give it

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:21.120 
this new DNA that's taken up can give it
different<00:04:19.090> functions<00:04:19.510> for<00:04:19.810> example<00:04:20.410> there

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:21.130 
different functions for example there

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:24.630 
different functions for example there
are<00:04:21.240> species<00:04:22.240> of<00:04:22.540> e.coli<00:04:23.230> that<00:04:24.040> actually

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:24.640 
are species of e.coli that actually

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:27.510 
are species of e.coli that actually
produce<00:04:24.910> sugar<00:04:25.630> toxin<00:04:26.170> this<00:04:26.770> is<00:04:26.890> a<00:04:26.920> toxin<00:04:27.490> that

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:27.520 
produce sugar toxin this is a toxin that

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:33.590 
produce sugar toxin this is a toxin that
they<00:04:28.120> obtained<00:04:28.870> from<00:04:30.930> bacteria<00:04:31.930> the<00:04:32.110> bacteria

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:33.600 
they obtained from bacteria the bacteria

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:36.720 
they obtained from bacteria the bacteria
tight<00:04:34.600> Shigella<00:04:35.140> so<00:04:35.710> Shigella<00:04:36.100> produces

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:36.730 
tight Shigella so Shigella produces

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:39.030 
tight Shigella so Shigella produces
shigga<00:04:36.970> toxin<00:04:37.420> the<00:04:37.960> son<00:04:38.110> e.coli<00:04:38.440> cells<00:04:38.620> can

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:39.040 
shigga toxin the son e.coli cells can

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:40.770 
shigga toxin the son e.coli cells can
produce<00:04:39.160> it<00:04:39.430> too<00:04:39.640> because<00:04:40.090> they're<00:04:40.390> able<00:04:40.660> to

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:40.780 
produce it too because they're able to

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:41.850 
produce it too because they're able to
go<00:04:40.900> through<00:04:41.110> this<00:04:41.290> genetic<00:04:41.620> recombination

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:41.860 
go through this genetic recombination

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:45.810 
go through this genetic recombination
process<00:04:42.900> this<00:04:43.900> DNA<00:04:44.410> could<00:04:44.620> also<00:04:44.830> encode<00:04:45.460> for

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:45.820 
process this DNA could also encode for

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:49.440 
process this DNA could also encode for
Tyrion's<00:04:46.360> factors<00:04:46.840> for<00:04:47.380> example<00:04:48.270> once<00:04:49.270> it's

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:49.450 
Tyrion's factors for example once it's

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:51.840 
Tyrion's factors for example once it's
real<00:04:49.690> it's<00:04:49.840> factor<00:04:50.170> might<00:04:50.320> be<00:04:50.470> a<00:04:50.500> capsule<00:04:51.100> if

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:51.850 
real it's factor might be a capsule if

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:53.700 
real it's factor might be a capsule if
the<00:04:52.030> bacteria<00:04:52.570> can<00:04:52.780> produce<00:04:52.930> a<00:04:53.080> capsule

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:53.710 
the bacteria can produce a capsule

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:56.820 
the bacteria can produce a capsule
covering<00:04:54.520> its<00:04:54.760> outer<00:04:54.970> cell<00:04:55.300> wall<00:04:55.600> this<00:04:56.410> may

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:56.830 
covering its outer cell wall this may

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:59.460 
covering its outer cell wall this may
enable<00:04:57.070> it<00:04:57.310> to<00:04:57.340> hide<00:04:57.760> from<00:04:58.210> a<00:04:58.510> host<00:04:58.720> immune

00:04:59.460 --> 00:04:59.470 
enable it to hide from a host immune

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:03.180 
enable it to hide from a host immune
system<00:05:00.120> and<00:05:01.120> so<00:05:01.360> this<00:05:01.750> is<00:05:01.990> why<00:05:02.260> the<00:05:02.320> process<00:05:02.830> of

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:03.190 
system and so this is why the process of

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:05.400 
system and so this is why the process of
transformation<00:05:03.670> is<00:05:04.330> very<00:05:04.840> important<00:05:05.320> to

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:05.410 
transformation is very important to

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:07.530 
transformation is very important to
bacterial<00:05:05.920> cells<00:05:06.160> and<00:05:06.520> that<00:05:06.970> it<00:05:07.120> can<00:05:07.300> enable

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:07.540 
bacterial cells and that it can enable

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:10.860 
bacterial cells and that it can enable
them<00:05:07.900> to<00:05:08.130> survive<00:05:09.130> in<00:05:09.870> different

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:10.870 
them to survive in different

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:12.150 
them to survive in different
environments<00:05:10.990> they<00:05:11.650> might<00:05:11.830> not<00:05:11.980> have<00:05:12.070> been

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:12.160 
environments they might not have been

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:14.970 
environments they might not have been
able<00:05:12.280> to<00:05:12.430> otherwise
