00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
it a little twist like so now if you

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:09.410 
it a little twist like so now if you
don't<00:02:08.459> have<00:02:08.550> needlenose<00:02:08.759> pliers<00:02:09.060> you<00:02:09.270> could

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
don't have needlenose pliers you could

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.330 
don't have needlenose pliers you could
technically<00:02:10.140> maybe<00:02:10.380> put<00:02:10.590> a<00:02:10.619> big<00:02:10.830> nail<00:02:11.100> in

technically maybe put a big nail in
there<00:02:11.550> and<00:02:11.760> kind<00:02:12.330> of<00:02:12.360> open<00:02:12.720> it<00:02:12.840> up<00:02:12.960> but<00:02:13.260> the

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
there and kind of open it up but the

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.260 
there and kind of open it up but the
needlenose<00:02:13.950> pliers<00:02:14.310> just<00:02:14.550> give<00:02:15.090> you<00:02:15.150> a<00:02:15.180> little

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
needlenose pliers just give you a little

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:16.040 
needlenose pliers just give you a little
bit<00:02:15.420> more<00:02:15.510> control

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
bit more control

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.280 
bit more control
of<00:02:16.650> what<00:02:16.920> you're<00:02:17.100> doing<00:02:17.430> and<00:02:18.420> it's<00:02:18.810> also<00:02:18.990> a<00:02:19.170> lot

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
of what you're doing and it's also a lot

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.030 
of what you're doing and it's also a lot
safer<00:02:20.150> when<00:02:21.150> doing<00:02:21.480> this<00:02:21.630> and<00:02:22.470> so<00:02:22.710> what<00:02:22.830> you'll

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
safer when doing this and so what you'll

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.100 
safer when doing this and so what you'll
do<00:02:23.220> is<00:02:23.250> you'll<00:02:23.670> open<00:02:23.820> that<00:02:24.030> barrel<00:02:24.540> up<00:02:24.810> and

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
do is you'll open that barrel up and

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:26.690 
do is you'll open that barrel up and
you'll<00:02:25.650> see<00:02:25.710> you're<00:02:26.070> left<00:02:26.280> with<00:02:26.430> a<00:02:26.460> nice

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
you'll see you're left with a nice

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:33.110 
you'll see you're left with a nice
little<00:02:28.040> flat<00:02:29.040> piece<00:02:30.590> like<00:02:31.590> so<00:02:31.890> as<00:02:32.820> you<00:02:32.970> can<00:02:33.060> see

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:20.420 
looks like this and you just simply 3m
on<00:04:16.950> the<00:04:17.040> back<00:04:17.220> stick<00:04:17.880> it<00:04:18.000> to<00:04:18.090> the<00:04:18.209> car<00:04:18.470> and<00:04:19.470> you

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 
on the back stick it to the car and you

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:24.450 
on the back stick it to the car and you
are<00:04:20.459> ready<00:04:20.790> to<00:04:20.970> go<00:04:21.150> and<00:04:22.080> you<00:04:22.290> can

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:24.460 
are ready to go and you can

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:27.840 
are ready to go and you can
also<00:04:25.460> put<00:04:25.670> it<00:04:25.760> in<00:04:25.820> the<00:04:25.880> front<00:04:26.210> if<00:04:27.050> you<00:04:27.200> want<00:04:27.410> to

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:27.850 
also put it in the front if you want to

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:30.160 
also put it in the front if you want to
make<00:04:28.850> one<00:04:29.060> for<00:04:29.240> the<00:04:29.300> front<00:04:29.570> of<00:04:29.600> the<00:04:29.690> car

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:30.170 
make one for the front of the car

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:34.570 
make one for the front of the car
like<00:04:31.100> so<00:04:32.330> but<00:04:32.810> yet<00:04:33.440> the<00:04:33.620> take<00:04:34.070> into<00:04:34.310> account

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:34.580 
like so but yet the take into account

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:36.220 
like so but yet the take into account
though<00:04:34.820> if<00:04:34.880> you're<00:04:35.060> driving<00:04:35.690> your<00:04:35.870> car<00:04:35.900> around

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:36.230 
though if you're driving your car around

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:38.350 
though if you're driving your car around
and<00:04:36.530> you're<00:04:37.280> bumping<00:04:37.610> into<00:04:37.760> things<00:04:38.030> and<00:04:38.150> stuff

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:38.360 
and you're bumping into things and stuff

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:39.760 
and you're bumping into things and stuff
that<00:04:38.510> you<00:04:38.660> may<00:04:38.840> mess<00:04:39.080> up<00:04:39.230> your<00:04:39.380> little<00:04:39.590> toe

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:39.770 
that you may mess up your little toe

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:42.850 
that you may mess up your little toe
hook<00:04:40.010> so<00:04:40.300> it's<00:04:41.300> maybe<00:04:41.570> safer<00:04:42.260> just<00:04:42.350> to<00:04:42.500> put<00:04:42.710> one

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:42.860 
hook so it's maybe safer just to put one

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:45.600 
hook so it's maybe safer just to put one
in<00:04:42.950> the<00:04:43.040> back<00:04:43.250> just<00:04:44.210> to<00:04:44.300> play<00:04:44.480> it<00:04:44.570> safe<00:04:44.600> so<00:04:45.200> I

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:45.610 
in the back just to play it safe so I

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:50.460 
in the back just to play it safe so I
thought<00:04:46.610> this<00:04:46.760> is<00:04:46.910> a<00:04:46.940> pretty<00:04:47.540> neat<00:04:48.280> easy

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:50.470

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:54.160

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:57.970 
simple and cheap which is always good
