00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
are really hard to use because they

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.099 
are really hard to use because they
cause<00:00:59.609> a<00:00:59.640> lot<00:00:59.879> of<00:00:59.910> micro<00:01:00.300> exfoliation<00:01:00.750> on<00:01:00.989> this

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
and that's why I prefer to use sponges /

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.210 
and that's why I prefer to use sponges /
brushes<00:01:03.420> is<00:01:03.629> because<00:01:03.989> any<00:01:04.229> of<00:01:04.409> my<00:01:04.500> dry<00:01:04.739> spots<00:01:05.040> I

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220

just find that brushes just tend to kind

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.330 
just find that brushes just tend to kind
of<00:01:07.200> exaggerated<00:01:07.860> them<00:01:07.979> because<00:01:08.220> I'm

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
of exaggerated them because I'm

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.850 
of exaggerated them because I'm
exfoliating<00:01:09.119> over<00:01:09.420> that<00:01:09.570> area<00:01:09.840> and<00:01:10.229> then

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
exfoliating over that area and then

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.260 
exfoliating over that area and then
sometimes<00:01:11.340> too<00:01:11.549> for<00:01:11.790> people<00:01:12.000> with<00:01:12.119> really

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
your mind because these are a million

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.700 
your mind because these are a million
times<00:01:36.210> easier<00:01:36.420> to<00:01:36.750> use<00:01:36.930> their<00:01:37.229> Millie<00:01:37.439> times

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.980 
times easier to use their Millie times
quicker<00:01:38.040> to<00:01:38.280> use<00:01:38.310> and<00:01:38.729> they<00:01:39.210> don't<00:01:39.329> absorb<00:01:39.720> as

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
think that for mineral foundations you

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:14.890 
think that for mineral foundations you
will<00:02:13.490> still<00:02:13.730> get<00:02:13.850> a<00:02:13.910> much<00:02:14.150> better<00:02:14.390> result<00:02:14.600> with

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
will still get a much better result with

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.380 
will still get a much better result with
an<00:02:15.020> actual<00:02:15.380> mineral<00:02:16.010> foundation<00:02:16.610> brush<00:02:17.060> or

an actual mineral foundation brush or

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:18.580 
an actual mineral foundation brush or
something<00:02:17.690> that's<00:02:17.840> kind<00:02:18.080> of<00:02:18.110> going<00:02:18.290> to<00:02:18.350> buff

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
something that's kind of going to buff

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.530 
something that's kind of going to buff
it<00:02:18.710> in<00:02:18.890> more<00:02:19.160> just<00:02:19.730> because<00:02:19.820> I<00:02:20.030> find<00:02:20.300> that<00:02:20.450> if

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540

them<00:03:47.810> any<00:03:48.049> other<00:03:48.140> sponges<00:03:48.890> they're<00:03:49.220> not<00:03:49.670> at

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:50.030 
them any other sponges they're not at

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:51.759 
them any other sponges they're not at
all<00:03:50.090> sturdy<00:03:50.750> so<00:03:51.170> they're<00:03:51.440> just<00:03:51.620> going<00:03:51.709> to

00:03:51.759 --> 00:03:51.769 
all sturdy so they're just going to

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:53.590 
all sturdy so they're just going to
break<00:03:51.980> down<00:03:52.160> a<00:03:52.220> lot<00:03:52.579> more<00:03:52.760> than<00:03:52.970> a<00:03:53.000> brush<00:03:53.269> will

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:53.600 
break down a lot more than a brush will

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:55.270 
break down a lot more than a brush will
so<00:03:54.079> I<00:03:54.140> think<00:03:54.170> you<00:03:54.410> need<00:03:54.530> to<00:03:54.590> consider<00:03:54.769> that<00:03:54.980> too

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:55.280 
so I think you need to consider that too

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:56.229 
so I think you need to consider that too
when<00:03:55.459> you're<00:03:55.549> thinking<00:03:55.730> about<00:03:55.820> the<00:03:56.000> price

00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:56.239 
when you're thinking about the price

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:58.030 
when you're thinking about the price
difference<00:03:56.540> between<00:03:57.049> these<00:03:57.230> two<00:03:57.470> and<00:03:57.709> I've

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:58.040 
difference between these two and I've

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:59.350 
difference between these two and I've
heard<00:03:58.160> a<00:03:58.340> lot<00:03:58.370> of<00:03:58.519> people<00:03:58.700> to<00:03:58.940> say<00:03:59.150> that

this as opposed to the bottom of this

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:00.190 
this as opposed to the bottom of this
guy<00:04:58.370> which<00:04:58.610> is<00:04:58.760> what<00:04:59.030> I<00:04:59.060> typically<00:04:59.570> use<00:04:59.690> when<00:05:00.170> I

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:00.200 
guy which is what I typically use when I

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:02.440 
guy which is what I typically use when I
am<00:05:00.680> applying<00:05:01.250> this<00:05:01.610> and<00:05:01.880> using<00:05:02.150> it<00:05:02.240> for

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:02.450 
am applying this and using it for

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:05.260 
am applying this and using it for
foundations<00:05:03.050> so<00:05:03.350> I<00:05:03.590> do<00:05:03.920> like<00:05:04.310> that<00:05:04.670> about<00:05:04.820> it<00:05:05.120> I

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:05.270 
foundations so I do like that about it I

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:07.960 
foundations so I do like that about it I
kind<00:05:06.170> of<00:05:06.230> preferred<00:05:06.710> the<00:05:07.160> point<00:05:07.610> on<00:05:07.790> the

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:07.970 
kind of preferred the point on the

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:09.250 
kind of preferred the point on the
Beauty<00:05:08.210> Blender<00:05:08.300> for<00:05:08.780> some<00:05:08.900> reason<00:05:09.170> I<00:05:09.230> just

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:09.260 
Beauty Blender for some reason I just

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:10.480 
Beauty Blender for some reason I just
think<00:05:09.530> it's<00:05:09.620> a<00:05:09.680> little<00:05:09.800> bit<00:05:09.950> more<00:05:10.130> precise

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:10.490 
think it's a little bit more precise

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:12.280 
think it's a little bit more precise
than<00:05:10.700> the<00:05:10.820> point<00:05:11.060> on<00:05:11.150> this<00:05:11.300> one<00:05:11.540> is<00:05:11.720> but

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:12.290 
than the point on this one is but

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:13.960 
than the point on this one is but
regardless<00:05:12.710> it<00:05:13.010> is<00:05:13.070> such<00:05:13.490> a<00:05:13.520> big<00:05:13.760> price

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:13.970 
regardless it is such a big price

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:15.460 
regardless it is such a big price
difference<00:05:14.210> especially<00:05:14.630> if<00:05:15.050> you're<00:05:15.170> like<00:05:15.320> me

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:15.470 
difference especially if you're like me

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:16.780 
difference especially if you're like me
and<00:05:15.500> you<00:05:15.680> tend<00:05:15.890> to<00:05:15.950> repurchase<00:05:16.310> these<00:05:16.610> guys

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:16.790 
and you tend to repurchase these guys

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:18.250 
and you tend to repurchase these guys
like<00:05:17.030> crazy<00:05:17.300> because<00:05:17.750> they<00:05:17.960> are<00:05:18.020> the<00:05:18.230> only

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:18.260 
like crazy because they are the only

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:19.870 
like crazy because they are the only
method<00:05:18.680> of<00:05:18.950> applying<00:05:19.130> foundation<00:05:19.400> that<00:05:19.760> you

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:19.880 
method of applying foundation that you

method of applying foundation that you
like<00:05:20.150> I<00:05:20.450> definitely<00:05:21.170> recommend<00:05:21.470> going<00:05:21.860> with

last time I owned a Beauty Blender this

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:32.620 
last time I owned a Beauty Blender this
guy<00:05:30.050> wasn't<00:05:30.560> invented<00:05:31.040> yet<00:05:31.250> so<00:05:32.030> the<00:05:32.420> Beauty

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:32.630 
guy wasn't invented yet so the Beauty

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:34.060 
guy wasn't invented yet so the Beauty
Blender<00:05:32.750> was<00:05:33.020> really<00:05:33.260> the<00:05:33.380> only<00:05:33.560> good

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:34.070 
Blender was really the only good

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:35.440 
Blender was really the only good
foundation<00:05:34.610> sponge<00:05:34.850> out<00:05:35.030> there<00:05:35.240> on<00:05:35.360> the

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:35.450 
foundation sponge out there on the

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:38.110 
foundation sponge out there on the
market<00:05:35.740> but<00:05:36.740> as<00:05:36.830> soon<00:05:36.980> as<00:05:37.220> I<00:05:37.340> picked<00:05:37.610> up<00:05:37.760> this<00:05:37.910> I

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:38.120 
market but as soon as I picked up this I

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:41.590 
market but as soon as I picked up this I
remember<00:05:39.110> thinking<00:05:39.290> it<00:05:39.500> was<00:05:39.590> so<00:05:39.980> similar<00:05:40.600> but

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:41.600 
remember thinking it was so similar but

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:43.510 
remember thinking it was so similar but
I<00:05:41.660> decided<00:05:42.050> to<00:05:42.230> try<00:05:42.440> this<00:05:42.500> again<00:05:42.770> and<00:05:43.130> honestly

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:43.520 
I decided to try this again and honestly

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:45.040 
I decided to try this again and honestly
I'm<00:05:43.850> just<00:05:44.060> kind<00:05:44.270> of<00:05:44.330> disappointing<00:05:44.840> a<00:05:44.900> nice

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:45.050 
I'm just kind of disappointing a nice

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:46.990 
I'm just kind of disappointing a nice
but<00:05:45.320> twenty<00:05:45.740> dollars<00:05:46.010> on<00:05:46.160> a<00:05:46.190> sponge<00:05:46.490> because

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:47.000 
but twenty dollars on a sponge because

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.030 
but twenty dollars on a sponge because
this<00:05:47.300> guy<00:05:47.480> is<00:05:47.510> exactly<00:05:48.080> the<00:05:48.260> same<00:05:48.410> so<00:05:48.650> if<00:05:48.890> for

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:49.040 
this guy is exactly the same so if for

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:50.350 
this guy is exactly the same so if for
some<00:05:49.100> reason<00:05:49.250> you're<00:05:49.670> still<00:05:49.940> debating

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:50.360 
some reason you're still debating

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:51.490 
some reason you're still debating
between<00:05:50.480> the<00:05:50.810> two<00:05:50.990> or<00:05:51.230> if<00:05:51.350> you're<00:05:51.470> just

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:51.500 
between the two or if you're just

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:54.340 
between the two or if you're just
curious<00:05:51.920> I<00:05:52.340> definitely<00:05:53.180> prefer<00:05:53.660> this<00:05:53.960> one<00:05:54.170> I

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:54.350 
curious I definitely prefer this one I

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:56.230 
curious I definitely prefer this one I
just<00:05:54.590> think<00:05:54.680> the<00:05:54.920> price<00:05:55.280> is<00:05:55.310> better<00:05:55.730> i<00:05:56.000> think

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:56.240 
just think the price is better i think

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:58.870 
just think the price is better i think
that<00:05:56.750> the<00:05:56.930> overall<00:05:57.770> application<00:05:57.950> is<00:05:58.580> a<00:05:58.610> little

00:05:58.870 --> 00:05:58.880 
that the overall application is a little

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:00.730 
that the overall application is a little
bit<00:05:58.970> easier<00:05:59.330> because<00:05:59.570> of<00:06:00.080> the<00:06:00.170> way<00:06:00.320> that<00:06:00.530> this

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:00.740
