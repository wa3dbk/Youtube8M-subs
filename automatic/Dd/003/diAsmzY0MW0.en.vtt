00:03:02.979 --> 00:03:02.989 
string and I pluck it with my Janet

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:06.580 
string and I pluck it with my Janet
Kashmir

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:24.420 

and<00:03:07.590> then<00:03:07.680> I<00:03:07.770> do<00:03:07.830> the<00:03:07.980> hammer<00:03:08.160> on<00:03:08.870> its

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:40.070 

so

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:40.080 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:43.250 

okay<00:03:40.950> now<00:03:41.820> what<00:03:42.210> we'll<00:03:42.330> do<00:03:42.480> is<00:03:42.510> we'll<00:03:42.780> put<00:03:43.170> it

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
okay now what we'll do is we'll put it

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.020 
okay now what we'll do is we'll put it
to<00:03:43.350> a<00:03:43.380> click<00:03:43.680> track<00:03:43.860> so<00:03:44.370> you<00:03:44.400> can<00:03:44.580> hear<00:03:44.850> what<00:03:44.940> it

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
to a click track so you can hear what it

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:48.560 
to a click track so you can hear what it
sounds<00:03:45.270> like<00:03:45.330> -<00:03:45.630> uh<00:03:46.070> -<00:03:47.070> that'd<00:03:47.250> be<00:03:47.570> using

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:48.570 
sounds like - uh - that'd be using

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:51.980 
sounds like - uh - that'd be using
sixteenth<00:03:49.020> notes<00:03:49.730> and<00:03:50.730> it's<00:03:51.240> at<00:03:51.510> right<00:03:51.840> now

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:51.990 
sixteenth notes and it's at right now

00:03:51.990 --> 00:04:11.180 
sixteenth notes and it's at right now
say<00:03:52.200> that<00:03:52.410> 50<00:03:53.040> beats<00:03:53.220> per<00:03:53.490> minute

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.190 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:15.250 

and<00:04:12.090> now<00:04:12.210> I<00:04:12.240> speed<00:04:12.630> up<00:04:12.780> to<00:04:12.990> 80<00:04:13.380> beats<00:04:13.620> per<00:04:13.740> I

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:15.260 
and now I speed up to 80 beats per I

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.110 
and now I speed up to 80 beats per I
think<00:04:16.260> I<00:04:16.320> said<00:04:16.530> 80<00:04:16.709> beats<00:04:17.100> per<00:04:17.220> second<00:04:17.880> but<00:04:18.030> it

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120 
think I said 80 beats per second but it

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:24.710 
think I said 80 beats per second but it
was<00:04:18.420> half<00:04:18.630> 50<00:04:19.230> 80<00:04:19.500> beats<00:04:19.769> per<00:04:19.920> minute<00:04:23.720> all

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:24.720 
was half 50 80 beats per minute all

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:36.610 
was half 50 80 beats per minute all
right

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:36.620 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:39.550 

okay<00:04:37.520> now<00:04:37.700> we'll<00:04:38.330> put<00:04:38.570> it<00:04:38.660> to<00:04:38.780> a<00:04:38.810> drum<00:04:39.410> track

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:39.560 
okay now we'll put it to a drum track

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:58.460 
okay now we'll put it to a drum track
here

00:04:58.460 --> 00:04:58.470 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:08.229 

OOP

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:08.239 

00:05:08.239 --> 00:05:12.319 

all<00:05:09.239> right<00:05:10.249> there's<00:05:11.249> the<00:05:11.339> first<00:05:11.639> part<00:05:11.969> I'll<00:05:12.209> do

00:05:12.319 --> 00:05:12.329 
all right there's the first part I'll do

00:05:12.329 --> 00:05:13.729 
all right there's the first part I'll do
a<00:05:12.359> two-part<00:05:12.899> here<00:05:13.139> I'm<00:05:13.229> not<00:05:13.409> sure<00:05:13.589> how<00:05:13.709> long

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:13.739 
a two-part here I'm not sure how long

00:05:13.739 --> 00:05:16.099 
a two-part here I'm not sure how long
I'm<00:05:13.979> running<00:05:14.279> here<00:05:14.519> but<00:05:14.789> and<00:05:15.509> then<00:05:15.809> we'll<00:05:15.929> move

00:05:16.099 --> 00:05:16.109 
I'm running here but and then we'll move

00:05:16.109 --> 00:05:19.789 
I'm running here but and then we'll move
it<00:05:16.259> up<00:05:16.409> to<00:05:16.459> the<00:05:17.959> pentatonic<00:05:18.959> scale<00:05:19.679> how

00:05:19.789 --> 00:05:19.799 
it up to the pentatonic scale how

00:05:19.799 --> 00:05:22.129 
it up to the pentatonic scale how
exact<00:05:20.189> uses<00:05:20.609> it<00:05:20.759> using<00:05:21.449> the<00:05:21.509> whole<00:05:21.629> pentatonic

00:05:22.129 --> 00:05:22.139 
exact uses it using the whole pentatonic

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:25.669 
exact uses it using the whole pentatonic
scale<00:05:22.409> and<00:05:23.779> give<00:05:24.779> me<00:05:24.869> some<00:05:25.049> comments<00:05:25.529> here

00:05:25.669 --> 00:05:25.679 
scale and give me some comments here

00:05:25.679 --> 00:05:27.469 
scale and give me some comments here
that<00:05:25.949> way<00:05:26.069> if<00:05:26.279> you<00:05:26.429> guys<00:05:26.549> if<00:05:26.939> I'm<00:05:27.089> not<00:05:27.269> showing
