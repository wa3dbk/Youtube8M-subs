00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
so this is going to respond more quickly

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.980 
so this is going to respond more quickly

course<00:01:52.590> pedestrians<00:01:53.430> are<00:01:53.579> still<00:01:53.759> a<00:01:53.790> risk

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 
course pedestrians are still a risk

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.120 
course pedestrians are still a risk
but<00:01:55.159> the<00:01:55.280> cyber<00:01:55.549> card<00:01:55.880> does<00:01:56.240> its<00:01:56.420> job<00:01:57.130> like

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.130 
but the cyber card does its job like

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:00.940 
but the cyber card does its job like
just<00:01:58.369> now<00:01:58.460> the<00:01:58.640> car<00:01:59.090> has<00:01:59.119> brake<00:01:59.719> yeah<00:02:00.079> if<00:02:00.530> you

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950 
just now the car has brake yeah if you

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:03.819 
just now the car has brake yeah if you
found<00:02:01.340> somebody<00:02:01.640> in<00:02:02.090> the<00:02:02.240> past<00:02:02.479> close<00:02:03.020> one<00:02:03.289> but

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:03.829 
found somebody in the past close one but

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:06.789 
found somebody in the past close one but
this<00:02:03.920> near<00:02:04.159> miss<00:02:04.340> isn't<00:02:04.670> just<00:02:04.880> look<00:02:05.619> Power<00:02:06.619> has

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:06.799 
this near miss isn't just look Power has

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:09.130 
this near miss isn't just look Power has
spent<00:02:07.250> years<00:02:07.340> programming<00:02:08.209> the<00:02:08.330> cyber<00:02:08.569> car<00:02:08.869> to

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
spent years programming the cyber car to

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.110 
spent years programming the cyber car to
accurately<00:02:09.649> predict<00:02:10.160> the<00:02:10.369> paths<00:02:10.610> of<00:02:10.940> any

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
accurately predict the paths of any

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.229 
accurately predict the paths of any
obstacle<00:02:11.690> in<00:02:11.840> its<00:02:11.959> way<00:02:12.230> and<00:02:12.560> even<00:02:13.400> anticipate

00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:14.239 
obstacle in its way and even anticipate

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:16.690 
obstacle in its way and even anticipate
obstacles<00:02:14.810> that<00:02:15.019> it<00:02:15.170> can't<00:02:15.410> see<00:02:15.709> powers

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
obstacles that it can't see powers

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.550 
obstacles that it can't see powers
ultimate<00:02:17.150> goal<00:02:17.360> is<00:02:17.569> to<00:02:17.720> expand<00:02:18.080> this<00:02:18.260> car

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560

ultimate goal is to expand this car
sharing<00:02:18.950> system<00:02:19.400> so<00:02:19.670> after<00:02:19.819> you<00:02:20.060> get<00:02:20.269> out<00:02:20.450> the

sharing system so after you get out the

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:22.509

drastically<00:02:32.720> reducing<00:02:33.349> the<00:02:33.470> number<00:02:33.620> of<00:02:33.769> cars

00:02:34.089 --> 00:02:34.099 
drastically reducing the number of cars

drastically reducing the number of cars
on<00:02:34.400> the<00:02:34.519> road<00:02:34.780> last<00:02:35.780> ones<00:02:36.019> it<00:02:36.140> cannot<00:02:36.349> do

on the road last ones it cannot do

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:38.500 
on the road last ones it cannot do
everything<00:02:36.680> cannot<00:02:37.310> go<00:02:37.549> to<00:02:37.610> your<00:02:37.880> doorstep<00:02:38.090> if

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
everything cannot go to your doorstep if

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.449 
everything cannot go to your doorstep if
you<00:02:38.630> live<00:02:38.810> outside<00:02:38.959> of<00:02:39.230> the<00:02:39.380> city<00:02:39.470> so<00:02:40.069> you<00:02:40.130> need

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:40.459 
you live outside of the city so you need

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:42.400 
you live outside of the city so you need
a<00:02:40.489> combination<00:02:41.150> between<00:02:41.360> mass<00:02:41.900> transit<00:02:42.290> and

a combination between mass transit and

a combination between mass transit and
individual<00:02:43.220> transport<00:02:43.670> so<00:02:44.180> the<00:02:44.329> idea<00:02:44.450> is<00:02:44.660> to

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720 
individual transport so the idea is to

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.559 
individual transport so the idea is to
bring<00:02:45.079> actually<00:02:45.920> a<00:02:45.980> new<00:02:46.190> form<00:02:46.519> of<00:02:46.730> individual

00:02:47.559 --> 00:02:47.569 
bring actually a new form of individual

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:49.180 
bring actually a new form of individual
transportation<00:02:48.410> with<00:02:48.650> these<00:02:48.860> automated
