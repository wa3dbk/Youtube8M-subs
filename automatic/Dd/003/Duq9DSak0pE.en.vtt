00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:10.370
 a review of a very good application 

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:13.790
 to create your own skins the 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:16.480
 application is called genes and skins I les 

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:19.369
 I will leave is in the description of the video 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:22.670
 Well, I'll show you right now how 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:24.590
 it works we give it in create new by 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:26.090
 example, as I have a name, I give it 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:29.020
 in 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:29.020
 test 

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:35.710
 let's create after it's cut 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:37.960
 here you do not put him here 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:42.370
 and since you are configuring you for example 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:45.280
 here come the colors and all that you 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:48.720
 you can configure by a tango touch 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:53.390
 do you want it to be your skin 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:53.390
 it will appear in twilight 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:01:00.699
 you will say there is that offers pinche way 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:04.140
 he likes twilight, but it is not 

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:04.140
 only one that came to my mind 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:10.030
 Well, I'll be here to see 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:22.530
 there he is staying 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:22.530
 like the cove of his most bulging eyes 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.810
 and more blue 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:31.090
 and we are going to change this little bit for a green 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:35.490
 appointment not 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:35.490
 and also together a very cheerful 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:42.620
 so happy 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.620
 because you have to be happy 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:51.750
 we are going to put a tone a tone 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.750
 reddish not pink 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:02:00.100
 highlights the red red collapse 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:03.460
 a little bit dark what would he do with 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:05.600
 this good first he finished painting his 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:07.820
 pin 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.420
 do not want with this I will make a small 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.420
 scarf 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.010
 As you can see, there are kids left 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:21.410
 Oh 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.860
 so I stay young 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:39.830
 if you do not like bald speeches and 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.770
 weapons 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:44.770
 well not so much I do not want it to be so 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:47.640
 sad to say 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:47.640
 but you press 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:57.480
 if you keep racing if you already have these 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:03:01.290
 the sides are the same 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:03.360
 this in configure to be able to paint well the 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:06.060
 blah blah as you want 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:09.630

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:13.580
 the truth does not work very well this the 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:13.580

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:19.790

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:23.220
 test 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:26.750

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:26.750

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:38.970
 here where he says the most 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:42.080
 and I think he says he's already saved after 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:42.080
 they go to file manager 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:48.820
 of looking for a folder that awaits them 

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:48.820
