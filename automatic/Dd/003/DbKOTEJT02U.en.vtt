 at some stage, interest is revived 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.950
 something 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:47.930

 considered to be made up of

 impact mechanism which until the end 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.720
 not learned by dirty

 gradual impact but at the same 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:58.579
 time in one lymphatic drainage session with 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:01.670

 materials may contain the most 

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:15.560
 various pollutions are therefore in progress 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.630
 production they should be not easy 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.290
 prepackaged by banks and carefully 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:20.210
 cleared 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:23.000
 mud masks as a rule 

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:24.920
 include their composition clay it is needed and 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.960
 as a classifier and how to dilute in 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.880
 dirt because in some cases dirt 

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:30.890
 is too active to 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.750
 applied and on the skin in pure form but 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:35.210
 sometimes the other extreme happens 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:38.900
 You can purchase mud cosmetics in 

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:40.820
 a kind of cream where the dirt is contained in a very 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.220
 small quantities and rather plays a role 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:44.210
 dye to expect from such a cream 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.520
 mud actions 

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:49.340
 hardly accounted for algal mud 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:51.680
 masks are just figurative and dry 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.810
 dry foods do not need 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:56.330
 preservatives but requires dilution with water 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:58.280
 before use rule cosmetic 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:00.770
 mud and seaweed treatments 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:03.470
 held in motels and cosmetic 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:05.090
 centers and even then not in all but not in 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:06.740
 this is nothing complicated, all this can 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:09.290
 do it yourself at home 

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:11.510
 general rules are skin 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:13.610
 pre-wash mud mask 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:15.050
 mix and heat to comfort 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:17.650
 temperature in a water bath 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:20.720
 mask applied with a spatula or brush 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:22.520
 instead of covering the film is covered and 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:26.390
 wrapped with insulation to 

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:28.520
 keep moisture and heat after 20-30 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:30.740
 minutes the mask is washed off with water without mom 

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:33.160
 dry algal masks are divorced 

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:35.500
 warm water also applied as rubber 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:37.940
 for maximum effect 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:40.180
 recommend course application 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:43.190
 for example to combat acne 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:46.070
 it makes sense to take a course of eight ten 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:46.790
 procedures with an interval of 12 days between 

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:49.010
 procedures 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:50.840
 and supportive care everyone picks up 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:54.170
 for yourself individually it may be 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:56.110
 once a week or 1 1 2 weeks after 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:58.340
 washing off the mask is recommended 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:02.660
 use a technique appropriate to the type 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:04.940
 skin expect an immediate miracle from 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:06.860
 mud algal cosmetics of course 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:08.900
 not necessary but with due patience 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:14.210
 attitude towards a positive result 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:16.640
 not long to wait beauty 

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:18.590
 save the world said dostoevsky length 

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:23.350
 and hisses can not be called to talk but 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:23.350
 it is also known that beauty requires sacrifice
