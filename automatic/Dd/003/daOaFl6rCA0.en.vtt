00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:53.210 
we committed this kind of thing there's
one<00:03:51.330> there<00:03:51.570> in<00:03:51.840> the<00:03:52.020> last<00:03:52.200> fight<00:03:52.500> in<00:03:52.860> the<00:03:53.040> five

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
one there in the last fight in the five

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.040 
one there in the last fight in the five
games<00:03:53.250> that<00:03:53.640> they<00:03:53.730> play<00:03:53.760> these<00:03:54.480> two<00:03:54.750> teams

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:55.050 
games that they play these two teams

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:56.720 
games that they play these two teams
they<00:03:55.230> scored<00:03:55.530> five<00:03:55.740> in<00:03:55.800> the<00:03:56.040> first<00:03:56.220> hour<00:03:56.550> and

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
they scored five in the first hour and

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:00.380 
they scored five in the first hour and
ten<00:03:57.510> in<00:03:57.750> the<00:03:57.810> second<00:03:58.290> so<00:03:59.130> obviously<00:03:59.400> bit<00:04:00.120> cagey

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:00.390 
ten in the second so obviously bit cagey

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:02.330 
ten in the second so obviously bit cagey
the<00:04:00.660> beginning<00:04:01.020> and<00:04:01.260> up<00:04:01.530> it<00:04:01.710> up<00:04:01.800> in<00:04:01.920> the<00:04:02.010> second

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
the beginning and up it up in the second

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:04.010 
the beginning and up it up in the second
half<00:04:02.370> and<00:04:02.850> the<00:04:02.970> second<00:04:03.330> half<00:04:03.480> two<00:04:03.660> of<00:04:03.780> the<00:04:03.900> most

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:04.020 
half and the second half two of the most

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:07.040 
half and the second half two of the most
goals<00:04:04.380> is<00:04:04.560> 205<00:04:05.520> so<00:04:06.390> that<00:04:06.510> looks<00:04:06.630> quite<00:04:06.930> an

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:07.050 
goals is 205 so that looks quite an

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:09.590 
goals is 205 so that looks quite an
interesting<00:04:07.350> bet<00:04:07.740> I<00:04:08.090> think<00:04:09.090> it'd<00:04:09.180> be<00:04:09.209> a<00:04:09.300> cagey

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:09.600 
interesting bet I think it'd be a cagey

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:12.880 
interesting bet I think it'd be a cagey
affair<00:04:09.840> north<00:04:10.380> along<00:04:10.709> goals<00:04:10.980> is<00:04:11.160> 2.7<00:04:12.090> and

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:12.890 
affair north along goals is 2.7 and

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:15.740 
affair north along goals is 2.7 and
offensive<00:04:13.890> the<00:04:14.010> Dutch<00:04:14.220> just<00:04:14.459> to<00:04:14.640> edit<00:04:14.970> draw<00:04:15.570> at

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:15.750 
offensive the Dutch just to edit draw at

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:16.870 
offensive the Dutch just to edit draw at
halftime

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:16.880 
halftime

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:18.280 
halftime
and<00:04:16.970> they'll<00:04:17.120> sneak<00:04:17.450> it<00:04:17.660> in<00:04:17.750> the<00:04:17.840> second<00:04:18.200> half

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:18.290 
and they'll sneak it in the second half

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:21.630 
and they'll sneak it in the second half
so<00:04:18.500> draw<00:04:18.770> halftime<00:04:19.280> Colin<00:04:19.640> full<00:04:19.880> time<00:04:20.120> is<00:04:20.270> 4.25

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:21.640 
so draw halftime Colin full time is 4.25

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:24.370 
so draw halftime Colin full time is 4.25
also<00:04:22.640> there<00:04:22.940> we<00:04:23.120> do<00:04:23.270> off<00:04:23.480> sites<00:04:23.810> and<00:04:24.200> the

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:24.380 
also there we do off sites and the

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:26.980 
also there we do off sites and the
offsides<00:04:24.770> and<00:04:25.100> then<00:04:25.610> at<00:04:26.150> the<00:04:26.270> moment<00:04:26.600> Uruguay

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:26.990 
offsides and then at the moment Uruguay

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:31.690 
offsides and then at the moment Uruguay
about<00:04:27.140> 14<00:04:27.650> offsides<00:04:28.270> Holland<00:04:29.270> 17<00:04:29.840> and<00:04:30.700> Holland

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:31.700 
about 14 offsides Holland 17 and Holland

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:35.200 
about 14 offsides Holland 17 and Holland
to<00:04:31.790> get<00:04:31.940> the<00:04:32.030> most<00:04:32.240> upside<00:04:32.720> is<00:04:33.110> still<00:04:33.500> 2.2<00:04:34.340> so

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:35.210 
to get the most upside is still 2.2 so

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:37.590 
to get the most upside is still 2.2 so
that<00:04:35.360> looks<00:04:35.510> statistically<00:04:36.260> quite<00:04:36.500> good<00:04:36.710> and

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:37.600 
that looks statistically quite good and

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:40.270 
that looks statistically quite good and
an<00:04:38.600> interesting<00:04:38.810> stat<00:04:39.440> is<00:04:39.590> Holland<00:04:40.160> of

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:40.280 
an interesting stat is Holland of

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:42.820 
an interesting stat is Holland of
playset<00:04:40.730> American<00:04:41.240> sides<00:04:41.510> plus<00:04:41.960> 13<00:04:42.530> times

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:42.830 
playset American sides plus 13 times

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:45.610 
playset American sides plus 13 times
we've<00:04:43.100> only<00:04:43.250> lost<00:04:43.490> one<00:04:43.820> game<00:04:44.020> so<00:04:45.020> they've<00:04:45.410> got

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:45.620 
we've only lost one game so they've got

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:47.740 
we've only lost one game so they've got
you<00:04:45.980> know<00:04:46.010> they<00:04:46.280> can<00:04:46.430> soak<00:04:46.910> up<00:04:47.090> this<00:04:47.270> safe

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:47.750 
you know they can soak up this safe

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:50.230 
you know they can soak up this safe
American<00:04:48.320> spirit<00:04:48.770> and<00:04:49.040> there<00:04:49.190> I<00:04:49.400> can<00:04:49.970> see<00:04:50.000> them

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:50.240 
American spirit and there I can see them

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:51.730 
American spirit and there I can see them
doing<00:04:50.420> the<00:04:50.540> same<00:04:50.720> again<00:04:50.990> I<00:04:51.050> think<00:04:51.140> Uruguay's

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:51.740 
doing the same again I think Uruguay's

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:53.770 
doing the same again I think Uruguay's
only<00:04:52.070> hope<00:04:52.250> is<00:04:52.430> maybe<00:04:52.880> they<00:04:53.150> can<00:04:53.330> take<00:04:53.510> it<00:04:53.690> to

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:53.780 
only hope is maybe they can take it to

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:55.930 
only hope is maybe they can take it to
penalties<00:04:54.200> and<00:04:54.920> the<00:04:55.070> Dutch<00:04:55.250> are<00:04:55.400> very<00:04:55.640> good<00:04:55.820> on

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:55.940 
penalties and the Dutch are very good on

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:57.580 
penalties and the Dutch are very good on
penalties<00:04:56.360> they've<00:04:56.630> lost<00:04:56.870> the<00:04:57.110> last<00:04:57.140> four

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:57.590 
penalties they've lost the last four

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:00.130 
penalties they've lost the last four
penalties<00:04:58.070> and<00:04:58.520> only<00:04:58.970> warm<00:04:59.150> one<00:04:59.330> of<00:04:59.450> them<00:04:59.600> so

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:00.140 
penalties and only warm one of them so

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:02.980 
penalties and only warm one of them so
