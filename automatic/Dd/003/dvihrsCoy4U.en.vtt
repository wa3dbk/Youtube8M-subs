basically this is your primer okay it's
a<00:00:22.410> little<00:00:23.070> pump<00:00:23.340> that<00:00:23.490> helps<00:00:23.699> manually<00:00:24.510> pump

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
a little pump that helps manually pump

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.050 
a little pump that helps manually pump
the<00:00:24.810> water<00:00:24.900> through<00:00:25.490> and<00:00:26.490> then<00:00:26.699> you've<00:00:26.880> got

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
the water through and then you've got

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.089 
the water through and then you've got
your<00:00:27.240> in<00:00:28.140> and<00:00:28.740> out<00:00:28.830> outlets<00:00:29.730> if<00:00:29.880> you<00:00:29.970> like

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:31.099 
your in and out outlets if you like

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:37.490 
your in and out outlets if you like
basically<00:00:32.809> this<00:00:33.809> bit<00:00:34.020> here<00:00:34.940> which<00:00:35.940> says<00:00:36.180> in<00:00:36.690> I

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
basically this bit here which says in I

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.880 
basically this bit here which says in I
put<00:00:38.129> on<00:00:38.270> to<00:00:39.270> mean<00:00:39.420> that's<00:00:39.660> the<00:00:39.809> bit<00:00:39.960> that<00:00:40.079> goes

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
put on to mean that's the bit that goes

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:47.229 
put on to mean that's the bit that goes
into<00:00:42.379> the<00:00:43.379> aquarium's<00:00:43.860> that<00:00:44.040> goes<00:00:44.219> up<00:00:44.370> there

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:47.239 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:50.389 

down<00:00:48.239> here<00:00:48.300> okay<00:00:48.960> so<00:00:49.110> basically<00:00:49.680> it<00:00:49.920> sucks<00:00:50.190> the

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
down here okay so basically it sucks the

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.729 
down here okay so basically it sucks the
water<00:00:50.520> in<00:00:51.239> through<00:00:51.750> this<00:00:51.899> two<00:00:52.110> top<00:00:52.320> goes<00:00:52.530> this

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
water in through this two top goes this

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.920 
water in through this two top goes this
way<00:00:52.949> the<00:00:53.100> water<00:00:53.280> flow<00:00:53.489> is<00:00:53.640> going<00:00:53.820> that<00:00:54.719> way

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
way the water flow is going that way

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.810 
way the water flow is going that way
taking<00:00:55.410> it<00:00:55.649> to<00:00:56.039> UM<00:00:57.469> to<00:00:58.469> the<00:00:58.710> to<00:00:59.489> the<00:00:59.609> actual

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
taking it to UM to the to the actual

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.520 
taking it to UM to the to the actual
filter<00:01:00.120> so<00:01:00.629> the<00:01:00.719> water<00:01:00.899> is<00:01:01.079> coming<00:01:01.230> through

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
filter so the water is coming through

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.950 
filter so the water is coming through
here<00:01:01.770> into<00:01:02.579> the<00:01:02.969> system<00:01:03.359> going<00:01:03.629> around<00:01:03.840> the

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
here into the system going around the

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.469 
here into the system going around the
system<00:01:04.400> doing<00:01:05.400> all<00:01:05.489> that<00:01:05.610> stuff<00:01:05.729> and<00:01:06.119> climb

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
system doing all that stuff and climb

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.870 
system doing all that stuff and climb
back<00:01:06.720> out<00:01:06.900> this<00:01:07.380> way<00:01:07.619> yeah<00:01:07.979> so<00:01:08.460> you<00:01:08.549> can<00:01:08.670> all

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
back out this way yeah so you can all

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.310 
back out this way yeah so you can all
intake<00:01:09.210> that<00:01:09.360> by<00:01:09.780> looking<00:01:10.110> at<00:01:10.200> these

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
intake that by looking at these

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.100 
intake that by looking at these
believers<00:01:10.979> here<00:01:11.369> okay<00:01:12.119> so<00:01:12.299> that's<00:01:12.780> one<00:01:13.020> that

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
believers here okay so that's one that

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.990 
believers here okay so that's one that
takes<00:01:13.320> water<00:01:13.530> into<00:01:13.799> the<00:01:13.890> system<00:01:14.070> and<00:01:14.520> that's

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
takes water into the system and that's

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.130 
takes water into the system and that's
the<00:01:15.119> one<00:01:15.240> that<00:01:15.330> takes<00:01:15.540> it<00:01:15.689> back<00:01:15.840> to<00:01:16.049> the

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
the one that takes it back to the

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.830 
the one that takes it back to the
aquarium<00:01:16.490> and<00:01:17.490> looking<00:01:17.790> from<00:01:17.970> above<00:01:18.090> that's

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
aquarium and looking from above that's

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.539 
aquarium and looking from above that's
here<00:01:19.290> and<00:01:19.470> if<00:01:20.130> you<00:01:20.250> situate<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:22.159> the<00:01:23.159> nozzle

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
here and if you situate the the nozzle

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.999 
here and if you situate the the nozzle
there<00:01:23.729> just<00:01:24.540> in<00:01:24.720> the<00:01:24.780> water<00:01:24.990> when<00:01:25.619> you<00:01:25.650> turn<00:01:25.920> it

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
there just in the water when you turn it

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.310 
there just in the water when you turn it
on<00:01:26.130> it<00:01:26.970> nicely<00:01:27.210> turbo<00:01:27.570> lates<00:01:27.750> the<00:01:27.869> water<00:01:28.049> that

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
on it nicely turbo lates the water that

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.120 
on it nicely turbo lates the water that
will<00:01:28.409> oxygenate<00:01:28.979> it<00:01:29.009> as<00:01:29.220> well<00:01:29.430> okay<00:01:30.979> I'm<00:01:31.979> not

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
will oxygenate it as well okay I'm not

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.289 
will oxygenate it as well okay I'm not
going<00:01:32.250> to<00:01:32.310> open<00:01:32.340> it<00:01:32.610> all<00:01:32.670> up<00:01:32.700> and<00:01:32.970> show<00:01:33.119> you<00:01:33.180> the

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
going to open it all up and show you the

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.539 
going to open it all up and show you the
insides<00:01:33.659> but<00:01:33.900> both<00:01:34.079> Lee<00:01:34.380> and<00:01:34.650> there's<00:01:35.310> a<00:01:35.400> shot

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
insides but both Lee and there's a shot

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:36.950 
insides but both Lee and there's a shot
of<00:01:35.610> machism<00:01:35.909> at<00:01:36.119> the<00:01:36.210> moment<00:01:36.479> this<00:01:36.540> is<00:01:36.689> full<00:01:36.869> of

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
of machism at the moment this is full of

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.530 
of machism at the moment this is full of
water<00:01:37.079> as<00:01:37.439> is<00:01:37.829> this<00:01:38.009> all<00:01:38.640> I've<00:01:38.939> done<00:01:39.150> literally

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
water as is this all I've done literally

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.740 
water as is this all I've done literally
is<00:01:39.869> unplugged<00:01:40.590> it<00:01:40.740> so<00:01:41.549> it's<00:01:41.700> working<00:01:41.880> doing<00:01:42.540> it

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
is unplugged it so it's working doing it

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.359 
is unplugged it so it's working doing it
doing<00:01:42.990> its<00:01:43.110> thing<00:01:43.229> and<00:01:43.439> I've<00:01:43.799> unplugged<00:01:44.189> it

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
doing its thing and I've unplugged it

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.270 
doing its thing and I've unplugged it
okay<00:01:44.790> so<00:01:45.360> all<00:01:45.720> you<00:01:45.840> do<00:01:45.930> now<00:01:46.079> is<00:01:46.290> push<00:01:47.159> this

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
okay so all you do now is push this

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.960 
okay so all you do now is push this
lever<00:01:47.490> up<00:01:48.409> okay<00:01:49.439> that<00:01:50.009> stops<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:50.430> water<00:01:50.640> flow

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
lever up okay that stops the water flow

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.340 
lever up okay that stops the water flow
so<00:01:51.000> that's<00:01:51.270> now<00:01:51.390> locked<00:01:51.600> off<00:01:51.810> the<00:01:51.930> water<00:01:52.110> flow

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
so that's now locked off the water flow

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:53.749 
so that's now locked off the water flow
so<00:01:52.470> no<00:01:52.680> water<00:01:52.890> all<00:01:53.040> come<00:01:53.250> out<00:01:53.340> you<00:01:53.460> might<00:01:53.549> get<00:01:53.729> a

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
so no water all come out you might get a

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.609 
so no water all come out you might get a
little<00:01:53.820> trickle<00:01:54.240> and<00:01:54.479> this<00:01:54.840> is<00:01:54.960> the<00:01:55.049> release

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
little trickle and this is the release

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.300 
little trickle and this is the release
mechanism<00:01:56.159> to<00:01:56.670> take<00:01:56.850> these<00:01:56.969> pipes<00:01:57.240> out<00:01:58.310> once

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
mechanism to take these pipes out once

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.179 
mechanism to take these pipes out once
you've<00:01:59.430> done<00:01:59.549> that<00:01:59.610> you<00:02:00.180> lift<00:02:00.689> away<00:02:01.070> and<00:02:02.070> like

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
you've done that you lift away and like

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.249
