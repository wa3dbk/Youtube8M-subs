me play the map claim interface is
practically<00:00:48.809> impenetrable<00:00:49.200> with<00:00:49.860> a<00:00:49.890> huge

number of claims on a single island what

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.840 
number of claims on a single island what
looked<00:00:52.320> decent<00:00:52.530> when<00:00:52.920> they<00:00:53.039> had<00:00:53.219> 10<00:00:53.430> to<00:00:53.520> 15

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
looked decent when they had 10 to 15

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.510 
looked decent when they had 10 to 15
claims<00:00:54.210> looks<00:00:54.660> horrific<00:00:54.899> with<00:00:55.350> hundreds<00:00:55.829> this

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
claims looks horrific with hundreds this

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:57.650 
claims looks horrific with hundreds this
is<00:00:56.610> pretty<00:00:56.820> obvious<00:00:57.000> and<00:00:57.329> i'll<00:00:57.390> be<00:00:57.480> showing

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
is pretty obvious and i'll be showing

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.689 
is pretty obvious and i'll be showing
you<00:00:57.809> in<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:57.960> background<00:00:58.350> exactly<00:00:59.160> how<00:00:59.340> crazy

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
you in the background exactly how crazy

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.459 
you in the background exactly how crazy
it<00:00:59.940> looks<00:01:00.180> so<00:01:00.510> their<00:01:00.719> solution<00:01:01.170> is<00:01:01.289> there

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
it looks so their solution is there

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:02.990 
it looks so their solution is there
going<00:01:01.590> to<00:01:01.680> be<00:01:01.739> completely<00:01:02.309> overhauling<00:01:02.820> the

going to be completely overhauling the

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.939 
going to be completely overhauling the
map<00:01:03.180> and<00:01:03.390> claim<00:01:03.600> interface<00:01:04.019> and<00:01:04.229> making<00:01:04.890> it

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
map and claim interface and making it

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.030 
map and claim interface and making it
extremely<00:01:05.220> easy<00:01:05.580> to<00:01:06.000> understand<00:01:06.450> at<00:01:06.630> a<00:01:06.659> glance

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:07.040 
extremely easy to understand at a glance

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:08.690 
extremely easy to understand at a glance
specifically<00:01:08.040> what<00:01:08.159> they're<00:01:08.310> talking<00:01:08.640> about

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
specifically what they're talking about

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.450 
specifically what they're talking about
is<00:01:09.000> you<00:01:09.840> will<00:01:09.990> never<00:01:10.229> see<00:01:10.530> a<00:01:10.710> claim<00:01:11.040> buffer

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
is you will never see a claim buffer

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.130 
is you will never see a claim buffer
again<00:01:11.670> that<00:01:11.850> is<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.090> white<00:01:12.360> box<00:01:12.720> that's

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140

around the inner box they're going to

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.490

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
down it's gonna be much easier on the

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.670

still<00:01:46.890> be<00:01:46.979> shown<00:01:47.189> as<00:01:47.399> a<00:01:47.430> 3d<00:01:47.850> box<00:01:48.030> that<00:01:48.420> way<00:01:48.509> you

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
still be shown as a 3d box that way you

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.179 
still be shown as a 3d box that way you
can<00:01:48.750> tell<00:01:48.899> how<00:01:49.140> high<00:01:49.409> it<00:01:49.470> is<00:01:49.619> off<00:01:49.799> the<00:01:49.950> ground

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
can tell how high it is off the ground

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:51.740 
can tell how high it is off the ground
up<00:01:50.549> in<00:01:50.759> the<00:01:50.850> air<00:01:50.970> if<00:01:51.180> it's<00:01:51.329> really<00:01:51.570> low

database more stable and it shouldn't

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:20.729 
database more stable and it shouldn't
make<00:02:19.389> it<00:02:19.599> much<00:02:19.780> easier<00:02:19.810> to<00:02:20.139> get<00:02:20.260> into<00:02:20.439> the<00:02:20.590> game
