when<00:04:47.590> the<00:04:47.680> fatalities<00:04:48.340> come<00:04:48.520> I<00:04:48.820> think<00:04:49.210> we

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:49.300 
when the fatalities come I think we

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:51.540 
when the fatalities come I think we
actually<00:04:49.570> do<00:04:49.690> have<00:04:49.780> to<00:04:49.840> get<00:04:50.080> off<00:04:50.340> we<00:04:51.340> know<00:04:51.430> that

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:51.550 
actually do have to get off we know that

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:53.550 
actually do have to get off we know that
the<00:04:51.700> Obama<00:04:52.420> moves<00:04:52.630> down<00:04:52.810> there<00:04:53.020> you<00:04:53.380> want<00:04:53.530> to

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:53.560 
the Obama moves down there you want to

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:55.440 
the Obama moves down there you want to
go<00:04:53.650> one<00:04:53.860> at<00:04:53.950> the<00:04:54.040> minute<00:04:54.220> obviously<00:04:54.580> but<00:04:55.210> I

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:55.450 
go one at the minute obviously but I

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:58.080 
go one at the minute obviously but I
think<00:04:55.870> we<00:04:56.020> do<00:04:56.230> actually<00:04:56.380> have<00:04:56.590> to<00:04:56.770> get<00:04:57.100> freedom

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:58.090 
think we do actually have to get freedom

00:04:58.090 --> 00:04:59.160 
think we do actually have to get freedom
because<00:04:58.360> then<00:04:58.480> we<00:04:58.570> get<00:04:58.660> the<00:04:58.750> further<00:04:58.960> that's

00:04:59.160 --> 00:04:59.170 
because then we get the further that's

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:00.660 
because then we get the further that's
when<00:04:59.290> you<00:04:59.380> can<00:04:59.500> push<00:04:59.680> it<00:04:59.890> so<00:05:00.010> I<00:05:00.100> swear<00:05:00.490> on<00:05:00.580> this

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:00.670 
when you can push it so I swear on this

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:02.850 
when you can push it so I swear on this
tutorial<00:05:00.960> there<00:05:01.960> was<00:05:02.080> a<00:05:02.110> third<00:05:02.410> one<00:05:02.440> there<00:05:02.770> and

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:02.860 
tutorial there was a third one there and

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:04.110 
tutorial there was a third one there and
you<00:05:02.920> push<00:05:03.130> that<00:05:03.280> further<00:05:03.520> one<00:05:03.730> away<00:05:03.880> it<00:05:03.940> was<00:05:04.060> a

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:04.120 
you push that further one away it was a

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:06.240 
you push that further one away it was a
different<00:05:04.420> one<00:05:04.540> I<00:05:04.720> think<00:05:05.170> it<00:05:05.500> was<00:05:05.650> so<00:05:06.220> I

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:06.250 
different one I think it was so I

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:08.450 
different one I think it was so I
hopefully<00:05:06.670> get<00:05:06.790> to<00:05:06.940> do<00:05:07.030> fatalities<00:05:07.570> just<00:05:07.840> yet

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:08.460 
hopefully get to do fatalities just yet

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:10.860 
hopefully get to do fatalities just yet
but<00:05:09.460> when<00:05:09.730> the<00:05:09.850> fatalities<00:05:10.480> come<00:05:10.660> out<00:05:10.750> it

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:10.870 
but when the fatalities come out it

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:11.970 
but when the fatalities come out it
seems<00:05:11.050> to<00:05:11.110> be<00:05:11.170> awesome<00:05:11.530> at<00:05:11.620> least<00:05:11.770> we<00:05:11.860> don't

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:11.980 
seems to be awesome at least we don't

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:13.080 
seems to be awesome at least we don't
have<00:05:12.010> to<00:05:12.100> do<00:05:12.220> like<00:05:12.340> when<00:05:12.520> you're<00:05:12.610> on<00:05:12.640> ps4<00:05:13.030> you
