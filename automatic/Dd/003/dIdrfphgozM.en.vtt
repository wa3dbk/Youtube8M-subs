00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.899
 hello and welcome I am 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:07.830
 I'll explain chelsea and I now 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:10.469
 the five main shows with patch 2.1 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.630
 wait in diablo 3 and the city 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.639
 Of course right at the beginning with the new ones 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.260
 Hellfire amoled who not yet 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.420
 it should know there is the hollow 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.100
 ring of fire that was such an item where you got the 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.869
 you have to collect keywords that you can 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.939
 you can see the teams in the picture on the left 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.279
 everyone gibbon drobny a key 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.170
 these keys open a portal and in the 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.000
 portal kills her then the bosses and then 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.470
 There are such reagents out of the 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.059
 Reagents builds the ring for you 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.920
 that works with the amulet now 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.989
 the same with the difference that 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.210
 the amulet, of course, very much 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.309
 has better network and you really 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.809
 really a very good upgrade gives that 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.420
 important now on the 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.430
 liveserver the keys to farm these 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:51.390
 to keep and then later 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:54.570
 use accordingly and both 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.579
 branch of ramadan this poison and 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.500
 although this is an item 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.390
 if now you can claim that 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.770
 a weapon application an additional 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.239
 pedestal is on this weapon to convincing 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.739
 of course, absolutely express 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.240
 and that's not it if you already 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.159
 it has a base over the already in 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.049
 Socks have the power from this socket 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:13.170
 another puts another 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:15.439
 human attribute such as zakspeed or 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.150
 percent of the match for the weapons with 

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:20.549
 increase water and take afterwards 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.229
 this object and offers gives you 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.850
 an additional socket on it thus 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.909
 For example, instead of four 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:29.520
 men tribute 5min attributes can 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:34.409
 so ready weapons you have 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:36.689
 make much stronger and continue 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.340
 is s directly with fuck number three and 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:40.650
 Number three is the so-called 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.170
 leaderboard and that will be patched 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.299
 2.1 0 1 led and that belongs to the 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.759
 the largest, the bait will is there, the 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.560
 time measured and then accordingly 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.000
 can you find yourself here in this list 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.710
 this so-called leaderboard 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.170
 find again how fast awaits you 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.990
 compare directly with other people 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.700
 We are the top animals for example 424 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.740
 That's if you help one 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.320
 has completed that means once 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.420
 from the beginning to the highest boss keel 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.460
 depending on how fast here comes waiting 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.590
 He then got another turn 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:12.660
 Opponent more opponents and so on and 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.709
 The whole thing then always goes up to the top 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.709
 up and up 

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:25.690
 like that and it goes straight on with facts 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:27.790
 facts , of course, we are the last 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:29.410
 the gems again with patch 2.1 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:31.210
 There is a lot here 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:33.460
 big difference there is always one 

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:35.200
 primary are primary bonus at the 

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:37.420
 gem as well as a secular 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.220
 bonus seconds without one should say 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.680
 or do you have to say if they 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:43.810
 it creates the desired time there 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.100
 swap npc for the secondary bonus 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:47.290
 Of course that is possible 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:49.480
 gemstones are very important because they are so 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.660
 better to cut your skillung 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.660
 can 

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:02.330
 so and finally facts like you see 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.040
 can we have such a great rift the 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:06.020
 with level 17 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:08.510
 and that means quite simple though 

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:10.340
 you want the you play the revocation 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:12.260
 he opened there, you played the 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:14.060
 Timeline foresaw afterward 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:16.130
 comes the so-called vips guardian 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:17.960
 there are also rests during which 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:19.730
 Go no last services drop then 

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:21.680
 all if he killed the guardian 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:24.170
 and how fast you were 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:26.360
 one believes this guardian keel 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:28.580
 more of these whiskeys which you then 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:30.920
 the next know that it is very important 

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:32.510
 not here to chill or handy 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:34.910
 easy to wait but he does 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:36.770
 this not as fast as possible 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:38.210
 faster load the by is all the 

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:39.770
 more level could skip that 

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:42.020
 means he has no one now 

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:43.430
 not such a good beer just needs 

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:45.380
 let's say seven to eight 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:47.390
 minutes to reach the shelves 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:50.030
 kill the stadiums there is a whiskey 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:53.120
 for level 7 that means skipping 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:54.890
 level 2 3 4 5 and 6 or can jump right on 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:56.630
 go into level 7 if we are now 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:58.130
 Of course, they are much faster and faster 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:00.200
 to kill those of the guardian 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:03.020
 Since we can directly from a kia 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:05.300
 and dropped to 17 level 20 or level 25 

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:06.770
 Therefore, always important as fast as 

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:08.420
 possible to go through that we too 

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:11.270
 we will optimize it to some tips 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:13.160
 give a lot of west and thus the 

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:15.140
 to bring the highest possible whiskey 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:17.120
 just so we can move faster 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:24.500
 and also higher and better positioned 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:26.450
 so that 's about 7 56 for patch 2.1 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:29.450
 And in addition, I say that now 

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:31.190
 Finally we have in this video in 

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:32.990
 was background was not played 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:35.090
 we have a little riddle for you 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:36.890
 Hiding something is not like that 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:38.180
 any normal may meet now 

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:39.650
 already noticed 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:41.120
 maybe not if there is a rear wheel 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:43.340
 in the comments if he was 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:45.410
 the solution finds what he is different or 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:47.270
 What gives her something unusual looks 

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:48.920
 let us know in the comments and the 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:50.690
 The first ones to do that are natural 

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:52.790
 Welcome to the next 

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:55.240
 join many thanks and to 

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:55.240
 next time
