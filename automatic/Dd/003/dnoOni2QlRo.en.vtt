 new products on 80 and two thousand square 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.180
 Suzuki's exposure meters represents 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:28.610
 Geneva models already familiar in Russia with

 pads due to jenny grand vitara and sx4 but 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.830
 main focus on devonian stand 

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:36.750
 manufacturer draws new 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.170
 family concept car 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:39.290
 instances 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:41.220
 the Japanese assure that this car will be 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:43.460
 exactly cry Lenin slogan companies 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:45.840
 suzuki is a compact lifestyle 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.230
 sports car bright 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:49.220
 the nature of which is accurately reflected in

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.130
 specifications 

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:57.730
 but this will be judged when it appears 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:00:59.850
 and the production version of this time concept 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.680
 created based on the new world which 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.400
 company in the club recently

 Yes, and I promise that during the course of trading on Thursday 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.330
 this car when it comes out series and 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:15.050
 wait for this is not long

 exhibitions environmental friendliness and 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:24.569
 Meet the new generation of hybrid 

00:01:24.569 --> 00:01:27.740
 technologies would be 60 plug-in hybrid this already 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:29.219
 ready for mass production 

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:32.340
 sports tournament sal with a record low 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.149
 carbon dioxide emissions 

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:37.579
 less than 50 grams per kilometer consumption 

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:38.709
 this scandinavian fuel 

00:01:38.709 --> 00:01:41.200
 make up one point nine liters 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:42.210
 per 100 kilometers

 really believe the future 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.310
 this is already a new technology 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.759
 which combines three engines and 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:58.369
 three ways to drive a diesel on a hybrid

 how to get away from road conditions 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:07.640
 use by the way this technology later 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.560
 will be used on SUVs 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.839
 Volvo which are so popular in Russia 

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:13.729

 car dealership updated master plan 

00:02:15.339 --> 00:02:18.359
 use by the way the details of Stalin 

00:02:18.359 --> 00:02:20.419
 this the Germans carefully concealed 

00:02:20.419 --> 00:02:22.709
 cars changed both outside and inside 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:25.439
 but if you add Ivan, you can 

00:02:25.439 --> 00:02:27.839
 evaluate yourself only technical updates 

00:02:27.839 --> 00:02:28.769
 tell you 1 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:31.469
 it's hard to believe but the car itself 

00:02:31.469 --> 00:02:34.079
 recognizes driver fatigue cant not 

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:36.329
 note and features such as president 

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:38.069
 there will be a traffic lane and 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:39.230
 electronic lock 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.029
 differential automatic 

00:02:41.029 --> 00:02:42.710
 high beam control 

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:44.230
 and how do you seven-speed 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.300
 dual clutch gearbox and 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.660
 system start stop which allows 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.040
 reduce fuel consumption 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.740
 environmental friendliness and profitability here 

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:54.270
 major trends of modern 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:56.670
 automotive clearly 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.419
 what the future is exactly 

00:02:58.419 --> 00:03:00.599
 enrollment technology
