 shape is and classification different 

00:05:08.949 --> 00:05:15.819

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:49.330
 others 

00:05:46.569 --> 00:05:51.159
 It's the side here, it's the same for everything. 

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:54.250
 The world here is bigger. 

00:05:51.159 --> 00:05:57.759

00:05:54.250 --> 00:06:00.279
 staff to ask questions for 

00:05:57.759 --> 00:06:03.159
 and another device 

00:06:00.279 --> 00:06:05.020

00:06:03.159 --> 00:06:08.279
 suggestions for tablet that gives you 

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:18.250
 favorites suggestions appears the same 

00:06:08.279 --> 00:06:22.300
 since the change here pro star wars not 

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:25.330
 is free or paid for and free 

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:27.099
 the player the cocktail is the one that is in 

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:28.479
 first place that is in second place 

00:06:27.099 --> 00:06:37.310
 in the same value 

00:06:28.479 --> 00:06:41.780

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:51.590
 another will have a normal here 

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:56.060
 you will hardly have a hd here pro 

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:58.490
 player is personal is more the owner 

00:06:56.060 --> 00:07:02.690
 of each theme, remembering that here the player 

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:05.090

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:08.600
