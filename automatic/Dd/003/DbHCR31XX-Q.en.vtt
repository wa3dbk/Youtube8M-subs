00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:35.610 
the top of this stack is what we call

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:10.800 
reason it's called a compound is that it

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:14.719 
reason it's called a compound is that it
allows<00:06:11.190> you<00:06:11.400> to<00:06:11.550> cut<00:06:11.760> compound<00:06:12.360> angles<00:06:13.490> on<00:06:14.490> top

the motor so you don't have to turn the
hand<00:07:07.840> wheel<00:07:08.159> and<00:07:09.159> it's<00:07:09.550> also<00:07:09.729> used<00:07:10.090> in<00:07:10.479> a<00:07:10.870> very

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:11.050 
hand wheel and it's also used in a very

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:13.399 
hand wheel and it's also used in a very
similar<00:07:11.289> fashion<00:07:11.590> for<00:07:12.250> cutting<00:07:12.550> threads

00:07:13.399 --> 00:07:13.409 
similar fashion for cutting threads

00:07:13.409 --> 00:07:16.529 
similar fashion for cutting threads
under<00:07:14.409> power<00:07:14.680> from<00:07:15.009> the<00:07:15.099> lathe<00:07:15.360> the<00:07:16.360> main

00:07:16.529 --> 00:07:16.539 
under power from the lathe the main

00:07:16.539 --> 00:07:17.790 
under power from the lathe the main
difference<00:07:16.960> is<00:07:17.139> that<00:07:17.169> when<00:07:17.500> you're<00:07:17.620> cutting

00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:17.800 
difference is that when you're cutting

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:23.219 
difference is that when you're cutting
threads<00:07:18.360> the<00:07:19.360> lead<00:07:19.990> screw<00:07:20.319> turns<00:07:20.590> more<00:07:20.919> slowly
