it<00:01:39.840> on<00:01:39.960> back<00:01:40.350> it<00:01:40.500> all<00:01:40.680> the<00:01:40.829> way<00:01:40.950> off<00:01:41.159> okay<00:01:42.150> as

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
it on back it all the way off okay as

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.600 
it on back it all the way off okay as
far<00:01:42.540> as<00:01:42.659> you<00:01:42.720> can<00:01:42.930> and<00:01:43.049> I'm<00:01:43.170> not<00:01:43.380> a<00:01:43.740> super<00:01:44.430> big

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
far as you can and I'm not a super big

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.069 
far as you can and I'm not a super big
fan<00:01:44.640> of<00:01:44.880> these<00:01:45.119> I<00:01:45.149> think<00:01:45.630> they're<00:01:45.780> a<00:01:45.810> little

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
fan of these I think they're a little

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.679 
fan of these I think they're a little
bit<00:01:46.320> cheap<00:01:46.590> but<00:01:46.920> it<00:01:47.579> is<00:01:47.790> what<00:01:48.000> it<00:01:48.090> is<00:01:48.210> and<00:01:48.479> then

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
bit cheap but it is what it is and then

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.990 
bit cheap but it is what it is and then
it's<00:01:49.530> going<00:01:49.740> to<00:01:49.799> be<00:01:49.890> a<00:01:49.920> tight<00:01:50.189> fit<00:01:50.220> but<00:01:50.790> get

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
it's going to be a tight fit but get

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.480 
it's going to be a tight fit but get
that<00:01:51.149> to<00:01:51.299> go<00:01:51.420> over<00:01:51.869> get<00:01:52.680> the<00:01:52.740> hose<00:01:53.009> to<00:01:53.159> go<00:01:53.280> over

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
that to go over get the hose to go over

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.190 
that to go over get the hose to go over
and<00:01:53.579> slide<00:01:53.790> it<00:01:53.880> as<00:01:54.000> far<00:01:54.299> down<00:01:54.329> as<00:01:54.509> you<00:01:54.630> can<00:01:54.720> like

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
and slide it as far down as you can like

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.889 
and slide it as far down as you can like

fittings<00:02:10.510> so<00:02:11.510> you<00:02:11.600> tighten<00:02:11.930> that<00:02:11.960> up<00:02:12.110> when<00:02:13.010> you

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:13.070 
fittings so you tighten that up when you

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:14.650 
fittings so you tighten that up when you
take<00:02:13.220> this<00:02:13.400> in<00:02:13.610> and<00:02:13.760> again<00:02:14.000> you'll<00:02:14.240> trim<00:02:14.510> these

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660 
take this in and again you'll trim these

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:17.140 
take this in and again you'll trim these
down<00:02:14.720> to<00:02:15.170> your<00:02:15.290> liking<00:02:15.800> things<00:02:16.190> like<00:02:16.400> that<00:02:16.640> you

down to your liking things like that you
do<00:02:17.270> the<00:02:17.390> same<00:02:17.600> thing<00:02:17.780> up<00:02:17.930> here<00:02:18.340> but<00:02:19.340> this<00:02:19.460> is

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
do the same thing up here but this is

up as far as you can like that and then

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.170 
up as far as you can like that and then
these<00:02:29.360> are<00:02:29.420> a<00:02:29.900> little<00:02:30.470> bit<00:02:30.740> tighter<00:02:31.580> to<00:02:31.730> get<00:02:32.030> in

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
these are a little bit tighter to get in

these are a little bit tighter to get in
some<00:02:33.170> people<00:02:34.060> have<00:02:35.080> tricks<00:02:36.080> I<00:02:36.230> just<00:02:36.470> use<00:02:36.650> work

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:37.550 
some people have tricks I just use work

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:43.680 
some people have tricks I just use work
force<00:02:37.910> like<00:02:38.209> the<00:02:38.300> big<00:02:38.450> dumb<00:02:38.660> idiot<00:02:38.959> that<00:02:39.080> I<00:02:39.140> am

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:47.980 

see<00:02:44.690> that<00:02:44.870> all<00:02:45.770> the<00:02:46.010> way<00:02:46.100> up<00:02:46.300> and<00:02:47.300> then<00:02:47.540> screw

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:47.990 
see that all the way up and then screw

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:52.540 
see that all the way up and then screw
that<00:02:48.950> down<00:02:50.380> that's<00:02:51.380> like<00:02:51.620> that<00:02:51.830> now<00:02:52.280> of<00:02:52.400> course

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:52.550 
that down that's like that now of course

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:56.890 
that down that's like that now of course
before<00:02:52.760> you<00:02:53.000> start<00:02:53.270> up<00:02:53.360> your<00:02:53.480> folder<00:02:55.690> pre<00:02:56.690> wash

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900 
before you start up your folder pre wash

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:58.510 
before you start up your folder pre wash
everything<00:02:57.290> so<00:02:58.010> you<00:02:58.100> don't<00:02:58.160> end<00:02:58.370> up<00:02:58.490> with

00:02:58.510 --> 00:02:58.520 
everything so you don't end up with

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:59.560 
everything so you don't end up with
stuffing<00:02:58.820> everywhere<00:02:59.150> and<00:02:59.240> of<00:02:59.270> course<00:02:59.480> I'm

00:02:59.560 --> 00:02:59.570 
stuffing everywhere and of course I'm

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:00.400 
stuffing everywhere and of course I'm
not<00:02:59.630> going<00:02:59.780> to<00:02:59.840> hook<00:02:59.900> this<00:03:00.020> stuff<00:03:00.200> on<00:03:00.320> the

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410 
not going to hook this stuff on the

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:02.110 
not going to hook this stuff on the
front<00:03:00.500> of<00:03:00.620> the<00:03:00.740> tank<00:03:00.920> but<00:03:01.520> this<00:03:01.640> is<00:03:01.790> just<00:03:01.940> to

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
front of the tank but this is just to

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.000 
front of the tank but this is just to
show<00:03:02.180> you<00:03:02.330> guys<00:03:02.600> so<00:03:03.530> you<00:03:03.620> may<00:03:03.739> keep<00:03:03.860> this

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
show you guys so you may keep this

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:07.750 
show you guys so you may keep this
separated<00:03:04.430> these<00:03:04.610> hoses<00:03:04.850> there<00:03:05.209> so<00:03:06.760> now

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760 
separated these hoses there so now

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.940 
separated these hoses there so now
before<00:03:07.880> you<00:03:08.150> plug<00:03:08.360> it<00:03:08.510> in<00:03:08.630> you<00:03:09.019> prime<00:03:09.380> it<00:03:09.650> okay

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
before you plug it in you prime it okay

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:13.390 
before you plug it in you prime it okay
so<00:03:10.610> AQUATOP<00:03:11.600> is<00:03:11.750> not<00:03:11.930> self<00:03:12.170> priming<00:03:12.440> so<00:03:13.280> you

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400 
so AQUATOP is not self priming so you

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:14.680 
so AQUATOP is not self priming so you
have<00:03:13.640> to<00:03:13.730> make<00:03:13.880> sure<00:03:13.910> everything<00:03:14.330> speed<00:03:14.570> is

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:14.690 
have to make sure everything speed is

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:18.490 
have to make sure everything speed is
good<00:03:14.989> and<00:03:15.260> then<00:03:16.070> your<00:03:16.489> big<00:03:16.730> button<00:03:17.350> mine<00:03:18.350> is

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500 
good and then your big button mine is

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:21.460 
good and then your big button mine is
red<00:03:18.769> somewhat<00:03:19.640> more<00:03:19.790> blue<00:03:20.000> you<00:03:20.959> push<00:03:21.170> your<00:03:21.290> big

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:21.470 
red somewhat more blue you push your big

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:23.500 
red somewhat more blue you push your big
red<00:03:21.650> button<00:03:21.950> down<00:03:21.980> some<00:03:22.880> people<00:03:23.150> say<00:03:23.300> I'll

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:23.510 
red button down some people say I'll

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:25.390 
red button down some people say I'll
hold<00:03:23.810> it<00:03:23.930> down<00:03:24.080> for<00:03:24.350> a<00:03:24.380> while<00:03:24.530> some<00:03:25.160> people

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.400 
hold it down for a while some people

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.250 
hold it down for a while some people
just<00:03:25.519> say<00:03:25.640> I'll<00:03:25.790> just<00:03:25.820> keep<00:03:26.150> pumping<00:03:26.390> I<00:03:26.780> got<00:03:27.230> a

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.260 
just say I'll just keep pumping I got a

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:28.539 
just say I'll just keep pumping I got a
little<00:03:27.440> cheat<00:03:27.680> that<00:03:27.709> I'll<00:03:27.980> probably<00:03:28.190> end<00:03:28.459> up

00:03:28.539 --> 00:03:28.549 
little cheat that I'll probably end up

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:30.870 
little cheat that I'll probably end up
doing<00:03:28.820> here<00:03:28.970> later<00:03:29.180> if<00:03:29.630> you<00:03:29.810> watch<00:03:30.019> the<00:03:30.200> output

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:30.880 
doing here later if you watch the output

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:33.550 
doing here later if you watch the output
right<00:03:31.880> there<00:03:32.180> you<00:03:32.870> will<00:03:32.989> see<00:03:33.170> when<00:03:33.320> I<00:03:33.350> push

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.560 
right there you will see when I push

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:36.270 
right there you will see when I push
this<00:03:33.709> down

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:36.280 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:40.020 

lols<00:03:37.090> come<00:03:37.270> out<00:03:37.420> its<00:03:37.690> expelling<00:03:38.110> air<00:03:38.820> and<00:03:39.820> if

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
lols come out its expelling air and if

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:42.110 
lols come out its expelling air and if
you<00:03:40.120> look<00:03:40.300> down<00:03:40.330> the<00:03:40.660> hose<00:03:40.870> of<00:03:41.440> the<00:03:41.680> inlet

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
you look down the hose of the inlet

you look down the hose of the inlet
water<00:03:43.120> is<00:03:43.360> coming<00:03:43.570> in<00:03:44.460> so<00:03:45.460> just<00:03:45.700> keep<00:03:45.970> pumping

and get that water coming in get that

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:51.830 
and get that water coming in get that
air<00:03:49.390> expelled<00:03:49.870> out

okay<00:03:52.840> sure<00:03:53.110> would<00:03:53.320> have<00:03:53.410> been<00:03:53.500> nice<00:03:53.710> if<00:03:53.740> they

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.040 
okay sure would have been nice if they

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:55.590 
okay sure would have been nice if they
would<00:03:54.160> have<00:03:54.220> made<00:03:54.370> an<00:03:54.490> auto<00:03:54.640> priming<00:03:55.120> system

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:55.600 
would have made an auto priming system

00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:00.900 
would have made an auto priming system
but<00:03:55.900> you<00:03:56.500> get<00:03:56.710> what<00:03:56.860> you<00:03:57.010> get<00:03:58.230> no<00:03:59.230> issues<00:03:59.910> and
