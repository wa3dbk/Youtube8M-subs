these<00:01:07.770> hinges<00:01:08.159> these<00:01:09.150> hinges<00:01:09.420> were<00:01:09.780> really

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
these hinges these hinges were really

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.280 
these hinges these hinges were really
loose<00:01:10.590> when<00:01:10.890> it<00:01:11.040> came<00:01:11.250> in<00:01:11.549> and<00:01:11.820> so<00:01:12.540> I<00:01:12.570> made<00:01:13.260> sure

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
loose when it came in and so I made sure

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.490

convert it and put a PC board in it with

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.820 
convert it and put a PC board in it with

a new microphone and receiver and that

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:30.010 
a new microphone and receiver and that
way<00:02:27.830> he<00:02:28.160> could<00:02:28.370> actually<00:02:28.640> use<00:02:29.210> this<00:02:29.450> telephone

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.020 
way he could actually use this telephone

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:32.980 
way he could actually use this telephone
every<00:02:30.380> day<00:02:30.650> now<00:02:31.550> we've<00:02:31.850> got<00:02:32.090> the<00:02:32.240> crank<00:02:32.540> going

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:32.990 
every day now we've got the crank going

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:36.100 
every day now we've got the crank going
but<00:02:33.490> some<00:02:34.490> of<00:02:34.610> the<00:02:34.670> wires<00:02:34.910> to<00:02:35.390> the<00:02:35.420> bells<00:02:35.780> are

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
but some of the wires to the bells are

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:40.960 
but some of the wires to the bells are
disconnected<00:02:36.920> so<00:02:39.400> kind<00:02:40.400> of<00:02:40.490> give<00:02:40.610> you<00:02:40.700> a<00:02:40.760> look

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
disconnected so kind of give you a look

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:42.450 
disconnected so kind of give you a look
at<00:02:41.090> that

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:42.460 
at that

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:44.860 
at that
so<00:02:43.460> the<00:02:43.640> bells<00:02:43.850> not<00:02:44.120> going<00:02:44.300> to<00:02:44.360> ring<00:02:44.570> at<00:02:44.690> this

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
so the bells not going to ring at this

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:46.990 
so the bells not going to ring at this
point<00:02:45.400> we're<00:02:46.400> still<00:02:46.670> in<00:02:46.850> the<00:02:46.970> initial

point we're still in the initial

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.660 
point we're still in the initial
checkout<00:02:47.900> so<00:02:48.740> that's<00:02:49.010> just<00:02:49.220> something<00:02:49.490> that

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
checkout so that's just something that

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:52.360

we'll<00:02:49.910> have<00:02:50.120> to<00:02:50.330> go<00:02:50.510> through<00:02:51.100> but<00:02:52.100> it<00:02:52.190> looks

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
we'll have to go through but it looks
