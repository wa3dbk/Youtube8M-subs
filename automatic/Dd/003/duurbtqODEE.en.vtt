 ricard and how a box mouth works 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:49.860
 but also to make a late start 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:54.480
 what 's the one to call a titan titan 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:58.230
 called the only Briton who hear these are 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:01.289
 letters so rare in beta or even 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:04.110
 even for the game I do not know that you have to 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:07.740
 possibility of calling the other an egg is 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:10.439
 a different titan than the case for us 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:13.680
 open only has 11 titles released 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:16.049

 I have the ability to push the Blessing on 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.560
 I got stuck bancard I burn a 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.060
 pecked iii called the titan 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.700

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:30.240
 for me then I just wanted to show 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:32.430

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.610
 receive the two titans that I came 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.799
 letter as soon as released to that is not 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.920
 so different it's all a show to 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:42.390

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:49.470
 I'll let you come from the gameplay there. 

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:51.780
 with the titan it 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.759
 He does not have that much difference. He has the 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:57.810
 with the same features as the other 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:59.969
