00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
 hello my friends from youtube another video from 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:08.730
 pro vegetables today I'm going to 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:11.550
 have the best camera is no effect or 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.920
 nothing but the best camera with the 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.719
 speed to take the pictures the truth 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.670
 that the speed is less than a second 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.280
 as you can see, so let's take 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.460
 a picture 

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:24.320
 come on I hope we have this approach 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.519
 let's go here in the bottom 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.730
 right 

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:30.230
 we go to take instant or not 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:32.419
 you have to remove the plane that the background that 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:34.969
 approach and nothing else we just play and 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:38.469
 depending on the photos you have several modes like this 

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:38.469
 let's get to know it thoroughly 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.379
 good so let's start with the 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.360
 name of the application as it can not 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:48.870
 be otherwise the application called 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.820
 fast boot camera light there are two versions 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.640
 the light that is what I 'm going to 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:56.550
 teach and the pro but recommended to try and 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:59.670
 download this version and then the other 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:02.659
 if you like it so let's open the 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.659
 camera application 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:08.909
 we hope it is now this 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.240
 It is simple enough already the 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.240
 I showed 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:17.009
 before the intro of this video and what 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.110
 more surprised me about this camera is that 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.390
 there are two versions one until free that 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.429
 it's very amazing and with the speed 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.229
 that I have the pictures or is well we touch 

00:01:23.429 --> 00:01:28.289
 take the picture I do not have to stop that was 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:30.539
 that neither anything like that but as you can see we have 

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:34.920
 to touch this little button of the part 

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:36.810
 lower right will focus us and it's 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:40.170
 the blank vote to get the 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.549
 photos well we touch him take the picture of 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.009
 the places options in the part 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:46.259
 top left as you can see I do not know 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:49.590
 if they will be focusing the camera 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:53.759
 there we are to focus the focus 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:57.170
 is to search to put the mode of 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:58.950
 flash to 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:02.399
 zoom 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:06.830
 other other measures of zooming the 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:09.880
 camera to see the front the mode of 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:09.880
 here this camera 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:18.540
 and the night mode that also has a 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:21.269
 effect to make one of nocturnal 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:24.209
 we see different configurations for 

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:28.159
 take the photo singles or a photo five 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:30.629
 photos many photos and a pre photography 

00:02:28.159 --> 00:02:33.100
 so for example let's select 

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:35.290
 five photos 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:38.950
 let's report without photos I was going to take 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:43.490
 five photos quickly to be finished 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:45.770
 to select but without photos ready 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:47.840
 and as you can see here, now a 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:50.570
 icon that is number 5 before is the 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:53.980
 number one now this number five and 

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:53.980
 let's take the picture 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:59.060
 let's go taking pictures as you see 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:01.700
 He delayed because he had already taken 5 photos 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:03.890
 every time we play once already zokora 5 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:06.530

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:09.849
 the photos that have been saved as 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:09.849

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:16.859
 that's how the revolution light looks 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:19.560
 I continue with the light version yesterday says it and 

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:21.900
 let's see photos as you can see they are 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.370
 photos that we were taking and if 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:26.819

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:29.700
 we can upload it to facebook return it to 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:32.129

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:38.390
 to the camera 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:44.880

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:49.819

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:10.830
 We want the truth that it is very fast and 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:13.170
 as in several stock chambers of the 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:15.990
 Cells do not need to install a 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:18.600
 custom rom or a rom cooked so that 

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:20.220
