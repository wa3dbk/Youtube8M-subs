00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
mind of like Remy units because it is

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:42.540

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
little you know smaller might be a

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:14.640 
little you know smaller might be a
little<00:03:13.210> cheaper<00:03:13.480> I<00:03:13.900> definitely<00:03:14.410> can

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
little cheaper I definitely can

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:16.910

recommend one I did a few videos back
actually<00:03:17.920> um<00:03:18.190> I<00:03:19.090> think<00:03:19.150> it's<00:03:19.510> called<00:03:19.690> the<00:03:19.840> LD

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:20.230 
actually um I think it's called the LD

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:22.950 
actually um I think it's called the LD
113<00:03:21.130> I<00:03:21.160> could<00:03:21.700> be<00:03:21.850> wrong<00:03:22.030> but<00:03:22.090> I<00:03:22.330> don't<00:03:22.660> think<00:03:22.810> I

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:22.960 
113 I could be wrong but I don't think I

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:26.790 
113 I could be wrong but I don't think I
am<00:03:23.170> and<00:03:23.560> that<00:03:24.040> wig<00:03:24.250> is<00:03:24.520> it's<00:03:25.090> not<00:03:25.420> as<00:03:25.480> long<00:03:26.380> as

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:26.800 
am and that wig is it's not as long as

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:28.770 
am and that wig is it's not as long as
this<00:03:26.950> one<00:03:27.160> but<00:03:27.190> it's<00:03:27.460> very<00:03:27.760> full<00:03:28.210> and<00:03:28.510> i

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:28.780 
this one but it's very full and i

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:30.780 
this one but it's very full and i
believe<00:03:29.080> it's<00:03:29.230> about<00:03:29.410> thirty<00:03:29.680> dollars<00:03:30.190> so

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
believe it's about thirty dollars so

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:33.990 
believe it's about thirty dollars so
can't<00:03:31.600> go<00:03:31.660> wrong<00:03:31.870> there<00:03:31.930> either<00:03:32.410> uh<00:03:32.820> but<00:03:33.820> all

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.000 
can't go wrong there either uh but all

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.360 
can't go wrong there either uh but all
of<00:03:34.180> that<00:03:34.240> aside<00:03:34.480> um<00:03:35.110> i<00:03:35.770> think<00:03:35.830> that<00:03:36.220> the

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.370 
of that aside um i think that the

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:38.760 
of that aside um i think that the
quality<00:03:36.700> of<00:03:36.970> the<00:03:37.150> hair<00:03:37.450> is<00:03:37.750> really<00:03:38.050> why<00:03:38.410> I'm

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:38.770 
quality of the hair is really why I'm

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:40.320 
quality of the hair is really why I'm
not<00:03:38.980> you<00:03:39.310> know<00:03:39.370> trying<00:03:39.760> to<00:03:39.790> read<00:03:39.970> this<00:03:40.150> wait

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:40.330 
not you know trying to read this wait
