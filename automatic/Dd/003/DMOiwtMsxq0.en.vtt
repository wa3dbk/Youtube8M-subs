miss any spots and as quick as we get
this<00:03:24.800> on<00:03:25.130> it's<00:03:25.850> making<00:03:26.360> a<00:03:26.450> chemical<00:03:26.690> bond<00:03:27.230> with

this on it's making a chemical bond with

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:31.980 
this on it's making a chemical bond with
the<00:03:27.740> boat<00:03:28.010> now<00:03:28.700> this<00:03:28.910> has<00:03:29.090> UV<00:03:29.510> protectant<00:03:30.110> and

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:31.990 
the boat now this has UV protectant and

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:34.480 
the boat now this has UV protectant and
water<00:03:32.990> shooting<00:03:33.320> action<00:03:33.590> like<00:03:33.860> a<00:03:33.890> natural<00:03:34.370> wax

but<00:03:34.760> again<00:03:34.970> all<00:03:35.180> synthetic<00:03:35.690> makes<00:03:36.200> the<00:03:36.350> bond

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:36.560 
but again all synthetic makes the bond

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.440 
but again all synthetic makes the bond
with<00:03:36.770> the<00:03:36.860> boat<00:03:37.070> because<00:03:37.700> it's<00:03:37.880> thinner<00:03:38.180> it

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:38.450 
with the boat because it's thinner it

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:40.240 
with the boat because it's thinner it
fills<00:03:38.810> in<00:03:39.050> all<00:03:39.170> the<00:03:39.230> pores<00:03:39.710> nooks<00:03:40.100> and

fills in all the pores nooks and

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:41.920 
fills in all the pores nooks and
crannies<00:03:40.700> then<00:03:41.240> you<00:03:41.300> just<00:03:41.480> take<00:03:41.600> a<00:03:41.660> dry

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:41.930 
crannies then you just take a dry

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:44.380 
crannies then you just take a dry
section<00:03:42.260> of<00:03:42.470> tile<00:03:42.650> and<00:03:42.680> watch<00:03:42.950> this<00:03:43.190> just<00:03:44.030> wipe

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:44.390 
section of tile and watch this just wipe

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:47.290 
section of tile and watch this just wipe
off<00:03:44.600> any<00:03:44.900> excess<00:03:45.680> there's<00:03:46.190> no<00:03:46.370> buffing<00:03:46.850> you

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:47.300 
off any excess there's no buffing you

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:49.410 
off any excess there's no buffing you
just<00:03:47.540> pulling<00:03:47.990> off<00:03:48.140> the<00:03:48.350> excess<00:03:48.770> material

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:49.420 
just pulling off the excess material

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:51.490 
just pulling off the excess material
most<00:03:50.420> of<00:03:50.570> its<00:03:50.690> bonded<00:03:50.990> with<00:03:51.080> the<00:03:51.170> boat<00:03:51.320> and<00:03:51.440> you

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:51.500 
most of its bonded with the boat and you

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:53.170 
most of its bonded with the boat and you
can<00:03:51.650> see<00:03:51.800> there's<00:03:51.980> very<00:03:52.250> little<00:03:52.460> to<00:03:52.700> no<00:03:52.730> powder

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:53.180 
can see there's very little to no powder

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:54.970 
can see there's very little to no powder
or<00:03:53.480> anything<00:03:54.020> because<00:03:54.170> there's<00:03:54.350> no<00:03:54.410> fillers

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:54.980 
or anything because there's no fillers

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:56.560 
or anything because there's no fillers
and<00:03:55.250> this<00:03:55.820> is<00:03:55.970> going<00:03:56.060> to<00:03:56.150> leave<00:03:56.300> a<00:03:56.330> great

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:56.570 
and this is going to leave a great
