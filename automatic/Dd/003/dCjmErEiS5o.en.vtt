last few weeks but I've been seeing a

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:21.590 
last few weeks but I've been seeing a
lot<00:04:20.810> of<00:04:20.959> them<00:04:21.109> still

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:21.600 
lot of them still

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.930

the<00:04:22.410> only<00:04:22.770> one<00:04:22.920> I've<00:04:23.040> seen<00:04:23.220> pull<00:04:23.460> anything<00:04:23.700> off

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
the only one I've seen pull anything off

the only one I've seen pull anything off
on<00:04:24.210> this<00:04:24.300> map<00:04:24.510> was<00:04:25.140> be<00:04:25.500> sooo<00:04:25.740> going<00:04:26.040> Sarah

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
on this map was be sooo going Sarah

on this map was be sooo going Sarah
river<00:04:26.670> on<00:04:26.940> this<00:04:27.090> map<00:04:27.300> and<00:04:27.540> I<00:04:27.600> really<00:04:27.930> think

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:28.080 
river on this map and I really think

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:29.990 
river on this map and I really think
that's<00:04:28.290> the<00:04:28.410> only<00:04:28.440> thing<00:04:28.740> that<00:04:29.250> products<00:04:29.850> can

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000 
that's the only thing that products can

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.760 
that's the only thing that products can
do<00:04:30.210> on<00:04:30.390> this<00:04:30.480> map<00:04:30.690> is<00:04:30.720> Siri<00:04:31.110> but<00:04:31.380> because<00:04:31.590> it's

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:31.770 
do on this map is Siri but because it's

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:34.040 
do on this map is Siri but because it's
the<00:04:31.890> only<00:04:31.920> the<00:04:32.790> only<00:04:33.030> real<00:04:33.240> build<00:04:33.540> that<00:04:33.750> the

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:34.050 
the only the only real build that the

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:36.740 
the only the only real build that the
Protoss<00:04:34.500> can<00:04:34.740> do<00:04:34.890> we'll<00:04:35.850> do<00:04:36.000> a<00:04:36.060> normal<00:04:36.300> build<00:04:36.660> I

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:36.750 
Protoss can do we'll do a normal build I

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:38.870 
Protoss can do we'll do a normal build I
guess<00:04:36.930> where<00:04:37.500> they<00:04:37.530> take<00:04:38.010> control<00:04:38.460> the<00:04:38.730> air

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:38.880 
guess where they take control the air

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:40.700 
guess where they take control the air
that's<00:04:39.240> part<00:04:39.570> of<00:04:39.630> their<00:04:39.750> strategy<00:04:40.260> to<00:04:40.410> take

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:40.710 
that's part of their strategy to take

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:42.800 
that's part of their strategy to take
control<00:04:40.980> of<00:04:41.070> the<00:04:41.250> air<00:04:41.430> and<00:04:41.670> if<00:04:42.300> they<00:04:42.450> don't

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:42.810 
control of the air and if they don't

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:45.430 
control of the air and if they don't
take<00:04:43.020> control<00:04:43.290> the<00:04:43.470> air<00:04:43.590> on<00:04:43.680> this<00:04:43.800> map<00:04:43.980> then

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:45.440 
take control the air on this map then

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:49.970 
take control the air on this map then
you<00:04:46.440> know<00:04:46.560> they<00:04:46.800> end<00:04:46.950> up<00:04:47.810> stuck<00:04:48.810> and<00:04:49.530> in<00:04:49.800> the

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:49.980 
you know they end up stuck and in the

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:52.070 
you know they end up stuck and in the
Zerg<00:04:50.280> like<00:04:50.520> I<00:04:50.550> said<00:04:50.820> they<00:04:51.330> can<00:04:51.480> go<00:04:51.630> around<00:04:51.810> and

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080 
Zerg like I said they can go around and

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.290 
Zerg like I said they can go around and
take<00:04:52.770> the<00:04:52.980> expansions<00:04:53.460> all<00:04:53.670> around<00:04:53.970> the<00:04:54.090> sides

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:54.300 
take the expansions all around the sides

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:57.020 
take the expansions all around the sides
of<00:04:54.390> the<00:04:54.510> map<00:04:54.950> there's<00:04:55.950> no<00:04:56.310> double<00:04:56.850> gas

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:57.030 
of the map there's no double gas

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:59.090 
of the map there's no double gas
expansions<00:04:57.720> they<00:04:57.870> can<00:04:58.020> go<00:04:58.140> and<00:04:58.290> take<00:04:58.470> they<00:04:59.070> can

00:04:59.090 --> 00:04:59.100 
expansions they can go and take they can

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:00.830 
expansions they can go and take they can
very<00:04:59.430> easily<00:04:59.490> with<00:04:59.820> four<00:05:00.150> hatcheries<00:05:00.570> end<00:05:00.750> up

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:00.840 
very easily with four hatcheries end up

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:04.070 
very easily with four hatcheries end up
with<00:05:01.020> four<00:05:01.260> gases<00:05:02.000> and<00:05:03.000> that<00:05:03.480> looks<00:05:03.720> like<00:05:03.810> I

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.080 
with four gases and that looks like I

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:08.780 
with four gases and that looks like I
guess<00:05:04.350> I<00:05:04.460> was<00:05:05.460> at<00:05:05.580> a<00:05:05.610> 10,000<00:05:07.460> 100,000<00:05:08.460> won<00:05:08.610> or

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:08.790 
guess I was at a 10,000 100,000 won or

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:13.010 
guess I was at a 10,000 100,000 won or
since<00:05:08.940> you<00:05:09.030> don't<00:05:09.590> looks<00:05:10.590> like<00:05:11.630> five<00:05:12.630> bucks<00:05:12.810> I

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:13.020 
since you don't looks like five bucks I

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:16.610 
since you don't looks like five bucks I
guess<00:05:13.200> um<00:05:14.600> one<00:05:15.600> have<00:05:15.870> a<00:05:15.900> very<00:05:16.140> very<00:05:16.350> low

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:16.620 
guess um one have a very very low

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:19.700 
guess um one have a very very low
exchange<00:05:17.430> rate<00:05:17.670> to<00:05:17.910> two<00:05:18.420> dollars<00:05:18.870> and<00:05:19.590> what

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:19.710 
exchange rate to two dollars and what

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:27.620 
exchange rate to two dollars and what
have<00:05:19.860> you<00:05:24.680> okay<00:05:25.680> no<00:05:25.800> actually<00:05:26.160> yeah<00:05:26.400> so<00:05:26.730> 10,000

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:27.630 
have you okay no actually yeah so 10,000

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:35.570 
have you okay no actually yeah so 10,000
one<00:05:27.810> is<00:05:28.560> eight<00:05:29.280> boss<00:05:29.580> so<00:05:32.270> very<00:05:33.270> low<00:05:34.580> exchange

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:35.580 
one is eight boss so very low exchange

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:38.870 
one is eight boss so very low exchange
rate<00:05:35.730> there<00:05:35.910> um<00:05:36.650> anyway<00:05:37.650> by<00:05:38.280> the<00:05:38.340> way<00:05:38.490> since<00:05:38.730> I

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:38.880 
rate there um anyway by the way since I

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:41.030 
rate there um anyway by the way since I
was<00:05:39.030> talking<00:05:39.300> about<00:05:39.360> donating<00:05:39.920> one<00:05:40.920> of<00:05:40.980> the

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:41.040 
was talking about donating one of the

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:42.050 
was talking about donating one of the
things<00:05:41.160> I<00:05:41.280> think<00:05:41.310> it's<00:05:41.550> been<00:05:41.700> cool<00:05:41.910> about

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:42.060 
things I think it's been cool about

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:44.480 
things I think it's been cool about
getting<00:05:42.660> donations<00:05:42.930> of<00:05:43.440> women<00:05:44.010> side

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:44.490 
getting donations of women side

00:07:42.279 --> 00:07:42.289 
guys can figure it out for yourself this

00:07:42.289 --> 00:07:45.159 
guys can figure it out for yourself this
however<00:07:42.469> is<00:07:42.740> a<00:07:43.219> rather<00:07:43.969> unorthodox<00:07:44.270> strategy

00:07:45.159 --> 00:07:45.169 
however is a rather unorthodox strategy

00:07:45.169 --> 00:07:47.760 
however is a rather unorthodox strategy
but<00:07:45.259> not<00:07:45.490> completely<00:07:46.490> unorthodox<00:07:46.819> rather

00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:47.770

but not completely unorthodox rather
rather<00:07:48.770> rather<00:07:50.379> not<00:07:51.379> usual<00:07:52.129> I<00:07:52.219> guess<00:07:52.249> you<00:07:52.519> say

00:07:52.779 --> 00:07:52.789 
rather rather not usual I guess you say

00:07:52.789 --> 00:07:55.360 
rather rather not usual I guess you say
we're<00:07:53.269> seeing<00:07:53.509> yellow<00:07:54.379> go<00:07:54.680> for<00:07:54.919> basically
