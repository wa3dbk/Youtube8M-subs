00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
all nice and symmetrical until we tilt

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.860 
all nice and symmetrical until we tilt
it<00:00:43.170> sideways<00:00:43.350> and<00:00:43.829> we<00:00:43.950> see<00:00:44.100> that<00:00:44.280> it's<00:00:44.460> almost

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:44.870 
it sideways and we see that it's almost

drawers<00:03:04.810> to<00:03:05.139> open<00:03:05.470> here<00:03:05.909> it<00:03:06.909> doesn't<00:03:07.209> seem<00:03:07.359> to

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 
drawers to open here it doesn't seem to

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:09.059 
drawers to open here it doesn't seem to
be<00:03:07.599> anything<00:03:07.930> at<00:03:08.200> all<00:03:08.290> under<00:03:08.650> there<00:03:08.799> that's

00:03:09.059 --> 00:03:09.069 
be anything at all under there that's

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:11.330 
be anything at all under there that's
just<00:03:09.310> for<00:03:09.489> closing<00:03:10.359> the<00:03:10.450> gap<00:03:10.599> I<00:03:10.840> would<00:03:10.959> assume

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
just for closing the gap I would assume

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:16.379 
just for closing the gap I would assume
this<00:03:12.340> would<00:03:12.519> be<00:03:12.700> the<00:03:12.849> charger<00:03:13.420> or<00:03:13.769> similar<00:03:15.389> so

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:16.389 
this would be the charger or similar so

00:03:16.389 --> 00:03:20.939 
this would be the charger or similar so
you<00:03:16.480> do<00:03:16.780> have<00:03:16.810> a<00:03:18.720> charger<00:03:19.720> with<00:03:19.900> ac/dc<00:03:20.500> adapter

00:03:20.939 --> 00:03:20.949 
you do have a charger with ac/dc adapter

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:25.439 
you do have a charger with ac/dc adapter
here<00:03:21.900> so<00:03:23.310> there's<00:03:24.310> the<00:03:24.579> club<00:03:25.090> that<00:03:25.239> would<00:03:25.329> go

00:03:25.439 --> 00:03:25.449 
here so there's the club that would go

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:27.839 
here so there's the club that would go
into<00:03:25.629> the<00:03:25.780> unit<00:03:26.169> itself<00:03:26.470> and<00:03:26.889> the<00:03:27.489> plug<00:03:27.699> that

00:03:27.839 --> 00:03:27.849 
into the unit itself and the plug that

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:30.240 
into the unit itself and the plug that
goes<00:03:28.060> into<00:03:28.389> the<00:03:28.930> wall<00:03:29.199> and<00:03:29.769> this<00:03:30.040> is<00:03:30.220> a

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
goes into the wall and this is a

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:33.270 
goes into the wall and this is a
converter<00:03:30.760> here<00:03:30.940> so<00:03:31.260> that's<00:03:32.260> one<00:03:33.040> of<00:03:33.159> the

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 
converter here so that's one of the

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.220 
converter here so that's one of the
things<00:03:33.549> that<00:03:33.790> notion<00:03:34.000> Inc<00:03:34.329> informed<00:03:34.840> us<00:03:34.989> is

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230 
things that notion Inc informed us is

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:37.830 
things that notion Inc informed us is
that<00:03:35.409> it<00:03:35.650> does<00:03:35.889> have<00:03:36.280> a<00:03:36.340> USB<00:03:36.940> adapter<00:03:37.720> to

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
that it does have a USB adapter to

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:41.240 
that it does have a USB adapter to
placed<00:03:38.109> on<00:03:38.319> a<00:03:38.590> Vinci<00:03:39.040> or<00:03:39.099> PC<00:03:39.669> and<00:03:40.169> that

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
placed on a Vinci or PC and that

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.500 
placed on a Vinci or PC and that
actually<00:03:42.250> does<00:03:42.400> not<00:03:42.579> come<00:03:42.819> with<00:03:42.970> it<00:03:43.000> but

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:43.510 
actually does not come with it but

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:47.309 
actually does not come with it but
they're<00:03:43.870> so<00:03:44.079> easy<00:03:44.319> to<00:03:44.620> get<00:03:44.829> that<00:03:45.629> you<00:03:46.629> really
