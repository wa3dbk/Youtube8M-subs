00:00:00.969 --> 00:00:06.809
 HP booked innovative design and actually 4 14 through it when you look at the market 

00:00:06.809 --> 00:00:10.260
 for the precursors then you have a number of different segments have the consumer 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:10.970
 notebooks 

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:12.829
 you have the business notebooks 

00:00:12.829 --> 00:00:17.489
 and you have the pol 4 delicious because it was a relatively expensive course I put 

00:00:17.489 --> 00:00:18.170
 to sell 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:22.040
 and that this is actually a bit of hp alternative to an apple for that 

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:25.920
 KPN trying Moselle more than a few hundred euros to watch that 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.110
 this edition cost around 700 euros but you get a lot of hard work for it 

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:31.960
 replacement 14 a set of books 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.910
 and what that is without makes sense to him 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:37.350
 be combined with a core i7 processor 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.649
 cor 7 7 20 km so the quad core variant yes actually no he would not find 

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:46.860
 like the one in the ekko 7 clamp on board, they have the hang of a little more economical 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.329
 twice korea version of the cage 7 but yes this year few new reasonable 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.030
 at aldi Zevenbergen i5 if you go to the points his own versions go to the 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:56.760
 ultra low voltage that is very fond 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.670
 japan came in the performance is just over half the janssen i want 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:04.130
 just do the national debt this is just have yes and that that money 

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.829
 for this 

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:06.250
 sure it is super fast 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:10.050
 the need is high another on the internet this same format also with one 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:15.040
 the cage 7 neatly laid drill that it is still a brother of this 84 40 spacious 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.810
 two years the whole book series but this is really our people who run you 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.540
 nevertheless very nicely finished have to say it is too much like one 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:25.900
 deficit the cheaper normal versions of the van hp which also have a bit 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:26.320
 Unfortunately 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:27.350
 such a finish 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:32.010
 but it is supercomplete lopez is also a 56 50 councilors dejonghe 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:33.910
 graphics processor is in it 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:36.800
 at 640 gigabyte hard drive 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:40.050
 you get two days because of this record it's a big round 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:44.320
 and then the ball turned and he worked to get you or you will not 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:45.969
 they come about three times 

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:49.619
 yes anyway i have that says lifted a goal he found it all very bad 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:50.680
 succeeded yes 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.710
 the big goal for this year's studio is that it is also nice 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:57.980
 terraces Friday afternoon windows that is a bit disappointing to people 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:02.270
 that used you sit with the battery together 600 half an hour and that is not now 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:03.320
 very much 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:07.580
 at an autopsy is a second battery need to do that yes if you 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:10.800
 the screen looks that there is again singer in the screen he swam with 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.780
 issued faster dissolves it has a resolution of 600 and 900 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.860
 there are also the disco dio and that is quite something 

00:02:19.539 --> 00:02:21.810
 The better can be better audio system 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.630
 yes a bit the pen nowadays all the manufacturers search through the 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.399
 cooperation or other 

00:02:26.399 --> 00:02:29.619
 other things to make a little bit but that also applies to this can 

00:02:29.619 --> 00:02:32.029
 you can do just that little bit better but i must honestly say that you still 

00:02:32.029 --> 00:02:35.420
 Staged Vion if you really do have a weird sound for a listening 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.860
 put it on a hospice is to put on a good headset 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:39.279
 your head 

00:02:39.279 --> 00:02:44.689
 and then to the beautiful real quality 9 and the fear is 600 by 900 for VTM 

00:02:44.689 --> 00:02:48.089
 screen is therefore important is that it is always good sharp yes that is 

00:02:48.089 --> 00:02:50.779
 sharp and also have more room for your applications, so for that matter 

00:02:50.779 --> 00:02:52.999
 it is again a very nice choice 

00:02:52.999 --> 00:02:57.029
 and if you go to work or grace vittek I think a little sign that 

00:02:57.029 --> 00:03:00.420
 only four gigabytes of memory still an album of 800 euros 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.990
 I honestly expected them to be 8 gigabytes he would definitely stop 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:07.860
 yes, however, you can hardly fault it 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:10.680
 except that there is still a hard disk to get also is free 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:11.730
 easily replaced by 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:15.250
 Something after, for example, was an SSD sweater. Of course there is also a bluray player 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.570
 in 

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:19.590
 before that, sitting underneath is a very complete one, the four teams also owned yes 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.639
 in terms of connections you also see good jobs 

00:03:21.639 --> 00:03:25.079
 Ahmadinejad pulled out the city to be named as your displayport 

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:25.590
 stand 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:29.950
 and that is Saturday that is also not until half an hour more and more often but it is 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:34.460
 not that all all booklets no yes I have I am also a nice shot 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:37.940
 fifty years of statistics the katwijker is also a nice one 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:38.650
 piece 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:41.280
 the hardware but yes it is a bit unfortunate that it is a bit standard 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:42.399
 looks like 

00:03:42.399 --> 00:03:44.849
 but it is better to wait for concerns 

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:45.879
 and 

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:49.609
 frankly i think it's a shame it's made and four gigabytes of memory 

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:50.710
 bet that 

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:54.270
 4 the if developer even have to purchase his departure forward that 

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:57.310
 a little bit before Sunday, in May 2006 

00:03:58.229 --> 00:04:01.879
 though he would have been two weeks before this week or next Friday 

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:03.549
 and would again so you know
