00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.309
 and this feast a lot of junk food and 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.349
 Overall, after this body has 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.360
 a very long time to recover exactly 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:13.620
 so I'll tell you about the bracelet 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:18.260
 japan companies 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.260
 namely about the up24 template 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.130
 What are these bracelets for? 

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:28.839
 Need Well first return and keep 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:30.220
 your body to keep track of 

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:32.379
 the number of steps 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:34.870
 recruited or vice versa with their wives calories 

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:37.030
 and for the quality of your sleep with the company already 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:38.829
 was an experience in bracelet design one of 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:41.230
 the first was ja bon app mass release 

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:42.699
 which was not so successful 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:45.129
 how many bracelets were defective 

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:46.989
 then there was a certain upgrade and was 

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:49.089
 jawbone up 2.0 released 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:50.050
 and just recently released from 

00:00:49.089 --> 00:00:52.449
 respectively, today's hero 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:55.179
 up24 release template 

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:56.170
 what exactly is different from 24 

00:00:55.179 --> 00:00:58.960
 its predecessor 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:01.030
 Firstly this is the size of the template 20400 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:03.460
 slightly at least a little easier 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.929
 the main difference is inside before 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.880
 to sync your data 

00:01:04.929 --> 00:01:08.619
 who reads a bracelet during the day 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:11.229
 had to embed and logic three with 

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:12.190
 half now jabba us 24 has 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:13.479
 transfer data by 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:15.729
 connect bluetooth 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:17.710
 directly to your gadget but you 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:17.950
 you will have to download the application 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:20.950
 but 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:22.659
 free available in the appstore after 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:24.550
 horse racing will need to pair your gadgets 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:26.350
 Bracelet teach bluetooth on the phone and 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:28.540
 after that all will be available to you 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:30.009
 bracelet possibilities but not necessarily 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:32.200
 keep bluetooth on 

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:34.659
 always enough to sync with 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.969
 morning and evening and during the day even without 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:39.159
 Connect to the bracelet anyway 

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:40.600
 will take your data into account if you 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:42.520
 want to know about the number of steps 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.049
 passed a day about the quality of your sleep 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.829
 have to wear a bracelet on your arm 

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:46.990
 constantly 

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:49.750
 but I would not say that it interferes with the opposite 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:52.240
 even get used to if you sleep in japan 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:54.640
 up24 then in the morning you can find out the data 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:56.680

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:59.530
 what time were the phase of deep sleep in 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:01.270
 which phase of the lung by the way in up24 is 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:03.369
 wonderful alarm clock that share 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.020
 2 types first standard 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:07.119
 you specify the exact time of awakening 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:10.090
 bracelet will be you exactly at this time 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:11.709
 second smart tracking down your sleep phases 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.959
 bracelet will be able to wake you up more 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:15.970
 have time for example set 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:16.600
 wake up parameter 7 am to seven 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:18.490
 twenty 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.020
 the bracelet will wake you up then when you 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:22.480
 will be the phase of light sleep 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:24.760
 it is during this time that I know 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.800
 I never wake up so good 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:29.620
 awakening by the way happens because 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:31.690
 vibrations bracelet on shaban's hand 24 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:33.820
 made of hypoallergenic materials 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:35.320
 he does not rub at all the skin on his hand about 

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:37.060
 there is only one physical 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:39.250
 button that lets you know about 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:42.340
 able to bracelet and translate it from 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:44.200
 daytime night league mode is the opposite if 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:45.520
 we will open the cap below then there will be 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:48.070
 be jack two and a half for 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:49.090
 charging by the way just keeps the battery in 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:51.190
 for 7 days 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:52.480
 at constantly included power - consuming 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:54.640
 bluetooth 4.0 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.230
 of the minuses, I probably note the absence 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.910
 hours since the bracelet is still not 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:00.310
 small size and would like to see 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:01.630
 time for them and the second is the cap 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:04.630
 which can lose that for me 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:06.400
 actually not a problem at all in general 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:07.960
 Overall I really liked the bracelet and 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.150
 I highly recommend to buy 

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:11.830
