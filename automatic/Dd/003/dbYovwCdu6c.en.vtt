00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:27.840 
the week and that's as expected as meant
a<00:00:26.410> lot<00:00:26.740> of<00:00:26.860> the<00:00:26.950> quarry<00:00:27.160> is<00:00:27.310> actually<00:00:27.610> kind<00:00:27.790> of

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:27.850 
a lot of the quarry is actually kind of

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:31.620 
a lot of the quarry is actually kind of
scoured<00:00:28.230> although<00:00:29.230> interestingly<00:00:30.210> we<00:00:31.210> went

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:31.630 
scoured although interestingly we went

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:34.680 
scoured although interestingly we went
in<00:00:31.750> its<00:00:31.900> chances<00:00:32.829> and<00:00:33.390> that<00:00:34.390> actually<00:00:34.450> had

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:34.690 
in its chances and that actually had

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:36.799 
in its chances and that actually had
quite<00:00:34.870> a<00:00:34.899> lot<00:00:35.020> of<00:00:35.110> soft<00:00:35.289> in<00:00:35.440> it<00:00:35.559> run<00:00:35.860> to<00:00:36.100> the

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
quite a lot of soft in it run to the

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.960 
quite a lot of soft in it run to the
climb<00:00:37.809> was<00:00:37.960> called<00:00:38.200> kind<00:00:38.560> of<00:00:38.620> ridge<00:00:38.800> so<00:00:39.790> that's

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:39.970 
climb was called kind of ridge so that's

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:43.050 
climb was called kind of ridge so that's
been<00:00:40.380> catching<00:00:41.380> snow<00:00:41.650> which<00:00:41.860> is<00:00:42.040> good<00:00:42.310> but

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:43.060 
been catching snow which is good but

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:44.580

good sliding on them as we continue to
get<00:01:53.350> more<00:01:54.340> snow<00:01:54.670> in<00:01:55.710> really<00:01:56.710> small<00:01:56.770> amounts

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:57.460 
get more snow in really small amounts

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:59.609 
get more snow in really small amounts
but<00:01:57.670> actually<00:01:58.119> usually<00:01:58.869> that's<00:01:59.200> the<00:01:59.290> best<00:01:59.470> way

00:01:59.609 --> 00:01:59.619 
but actually usually that's the best way

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:01.770 
but actually usually that's the best way
for<00:01:59.799> it<00:01:59.860> to<00:01:59.890> come<00:02:00.040> anyway<00:02:00.360> so<00:02:01.360> the<00:02:01.450> winds<00:02:01.600> this

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:01.780 
for it to come anyway so the winds this

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:03.120 
for it to come anyway so the winds this
week<00:02:01.930> have<00:02:02.110> been<00:02:02.140> predominately<00:02:02.740> stelae

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 
week have been predominately stelae

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:05.160 
week have been predominately stelae
which<00:02:03.450> has<00:02:04.450> meant<00:02:04.659> that<00:02:04.750> they<00:02:05.020> haven't

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170 
which has meant that they haven't

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:06.300 
which has meant that they haven't
actually<00:02:05.350> been<00:02:05.530> quite<00:02:05.680> so<00:02:05.860> strong<00:02:06.100> for<00:02:06.280> us

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:06.310 
actually been quite so strong for us

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:07.980 
actually been quite so strong for us
this<00:02:06.490> week<00:02:06.700> as<00:02:06.850> they<00:02:06.970> have<00:02:07.119> further<00:02:07.750> roast
