little<00:00:38.489> small<00:00:38.760> ones

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:40.730 
little small ones

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:43.479 
little small ones
now<00:00:41.730> you<00:00:41.820> gotta<00:00:42.000> cut<00:00:42.180> the<00:00:42.300> bottom<00:00:42.600> off<00:00:42.719> of<00:00:42.989> it

00:00:43.479 --> 00:00:43.489 
now you gotta cut the bottom off of it

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:45.830 
now you gotta cut the bottom off of it
and<00:00:44.489> cut<00:00:44.730> it<00:00:44.760> you<00:00:44.940> just<00:00:45.149> measure<00:00:45.390> so<00:00:45.719> it's

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
and cut it you just measure so it's

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.510 
and cut it you just measure so it's
about<00:00:46.020> a<00:00:46.079> quarter<00:00:46.350> inch<00:00:46.500> above<00:00:46.950> that<00:00:47.129> the

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
about a quarter inch above that the

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.220 
about a quarter inch above that the
heights<00:00:47.730> of<00:00:47.940> that<00:00:48.090> that<00:00:48.300> cat<00:00:48.510> food<00:00:48.690> can<00:00:48.989> there

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
heights of that that cat food can there

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.510 
heights of that that cat food can there
now<00:00:49.350> you<00:00:49.410> don't<00:00:49.620> have<00:00:49.710> to<00:00:49.770> drill<00:00:50.039> holes<00:00:50.070> in

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
now you don't have to drill holes in

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.150 
now you don't have to drill holes in
this<00:00:50.610> cat<00:00:50.820> food<00:00:51.059> can<00:00:51.329> either<00:00:51.800> just<00:00:52.800> leave<00:00:52.949> it

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
this cat food can either just leave it

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:53.750 
this cat food can either just leave it
alone

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
alone

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.790 
alone
this<00:00:54.480> one<00:00:54.660> here<00:00:54.809> you<00:00:54.899> cut<00:00:55.110> off<00:00:55.289> and<00:00:55.559> you<00:00:55.620> see

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
this one here you cut off and you see

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.290 
this one here you cut off and you see
I've<00:00:55.920> caught<00:00:56.190> little<00:00:56.399> notches<00:00:56.640> in<00:00:56.940> the<00:00:57.030> bottom

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
I've caught little notches in the bottom

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.990 
I've caught little notches in the bottom
and<00:00:57.449> that's<00:00:57.510> to<00:00:57.809> allow<00:00:58.250> the<00:00:59.250> alcohol<00:00:59.460> when<00:00:59.910> you

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
and that's to allow the alcohol when you

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.479 
and that's to allow the alcohol when you
pour<00:01:00.270> it<00:01:00.300> in<00:01:00.449> here<00:01:00.809> to<00:01:01.739> leach<00:01:01.890> out<00:01:02.100> into<00:01:02.160> the

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
pour it in here to leach out into the

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.670 
pour it in here to leach out into the
carbon<00:01:02.850> felt<00:01:03.120> and<00:01:04.110> there's<00:01:04.290> a<00:01:04.350> wick<00:01:04.530> up

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
carbon felt and there's a wick up

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.030 
carbon felt and there's a wick up
through<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:04.949> carbon<00:01:05.250> felt<00:01:05.519> in<00:01:05.610> the<00:01:05.670> bunk<00:01:07.040> put

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
through the carbon felt in the bunk put

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.440 
through the carbon felt in the bunk put
that<00:01:08.220> back<00:01:08.400> down<00:01:08.610> in<00:01:08.820> there<00:01:08.939> without<00:01:09.210> messing

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
that back down in there without messing

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.969 
that back down in there without messing
it<00:01:09.659> up<00:01:11.570> at<00:01:12.570> carbon<00:01:13.020> post<00:01:13.229> you<00:01:13.350> get<00:01:13.560> it<00:01:13.680> over<00:01:13.860> to

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
it up at carbon post you get it over to

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.530 
it up at carbon post you get it over to
Home<00:01:14.159> Depot<00:01:14.189> or<00:01:14.610> Lowe's<00:01:14.790> either<00:01:15.270> one<00:01:15.390> it's

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
Home Depot or Lowe's either one it's

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.330 
Home Depot or Lowe's either one it's
kind<00:01:15.720> of<00:01:15.750> expensive<00:01:16.049> though<00:01:16.350> but<00:01:16.920> you<00:01:17.040> can<00:01:17.189> use

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
kind of expensive though but you can use

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.880 
kind of expensive though but you can use
house<00:01:17.549> insulation<00:01:18.150> in<00:01:18.240> here<00:01:18.270> too<00:01:18.570> photos<00:01:18.930> so

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
house insulation in here too photos so

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.350 
house insulation in here too photos so
it<00:01:19.950> doesn't<00:01:20.220> have<00:01:20.310> to<00:01:20.400> be<00:01:20.520> carbon<00:01:20.880> felt<00:01:21.119> just

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
it doesn't have to be carbon felt just

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.670 
it doesn't have to be carbon felt just
to<00:01:21.509> kind<00:01:21.689> you<00:01:21.780> put<00:01:21.960> in<00:01:22.080> your<00:01:22.170> walls<00:01:22.380> they're

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
to kind you put in your walls they're

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.560 
to kind you put in your walls they're
just<00:01:22.920> about<00:01:23.159> insulation<00:01:23.820> you<00:01:23.880> can<00:01:24.240> put<00:01:24.479> it

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
just about insulation you can put it

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.039 
just about insulation you can put it
down<00:01:24.689> in<00:01:24.869> there<00:01:25.020> too<00:01:25.200> I<00:01:25.470> see<00:01:26.430> how<00:01:26.490> that's<00:01:26.670> cut

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:27.049 
down in there too I see how that's cut

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:29.480 
down in there too I see how that's cut
there's<00:01:28.049> about<00:01:28.229> a<00:01:28.290> quarter<00:01:28.740> inch<00:01:28.920> maybe<00:01:29.189> three

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
there's about a quarter inch maybe three

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.270 
there's about a quarter inch maybe three
3/8<00:01:30.240> of<00:01:30.390> both<00:01:30.600> heights<00:01:31.290> that<00:01:31.500> cat<00:01:31.799> food<00:01:32.040> can

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
3/8 of both heights that cat food can

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.630 
3/8 of both heights that cat food can
enact<00:01:32.520> that<00:01:32.689> exigency<00:01:33.689> in<00:01:33.810> here<00:01:33.960> too<00:01:34.579> now<00:01:35.579> the

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
enact that exigency in here too now the

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.730 
enact that exigency in here too now the
advantage<00:01:36.150> Sisto<00:01:38.750> is<00:01:39.750> the<00:01:39.990> fact<00:01:40.259> two<00:01:40.530> holes

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
advantage Sisto is the fact two holes

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.859 
advantage Sisto is the fact two holes
not<00:01:41.369> being<00:01:41.579> on<00:01:41.700> the<00:01:41.820> outside<00:01:42.180> that<00:01:42.240> doesn't

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
not being on the outside that doesn't

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.109 
not being on the outside that doesn't
those<00:01:43.530> tend<00:01:43.860> to<00:01:43.950> burn<00:01:44.070> out<00:01:44.369> and<00:01:44.670> up

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
those tend to burn out and up

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:46.999 
those tend to burn out and up
this<00:01:45.689> burns<00:01:45.990> right<00:01:46.229> here<00:01:46.470> at<00:01:46.560> the<00:01:46.649> top<00:01:46.799> of<00:01:46.829> this

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
this burns right here at the top of this

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.740 
this burns right here at the top of this
carbon<00:01:47.460> felt<00:01:47.670> so<00:01:47.820> it's<00:01:48.000> concentrated<00:01:48.659> right

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
carbon felt so it's concentrated right

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.410 
carbon felt so it's concentrated right
