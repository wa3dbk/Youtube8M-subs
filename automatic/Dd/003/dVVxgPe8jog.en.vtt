00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.320
 we say it's the system 

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:46.060
 in the program 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:51.340
 so that the blues that have accumulated 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:53.760
 it was shame 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.760
 since then the singer was present 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:59.780
 speaking rantala 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:01.340
 1 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.340
 so it's less safe 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.060
 with 32 points produced 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:18.520
 8 an Assize Court that joined them 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.010
 early 2009 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:22.600
 florence normand tellier 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.010
 so from then on we'll work percent 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:29.140
 the goal was to have in this dance to complete 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:33.920
 so from there in 2010 his lead and gigs 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.100
 plurilingualism out of their mass so that there are super heroes 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.430
 recognize 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:41.910
 for professional pig meals 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:43.530
 to sell 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:44.740
 but nothing 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:48.390
 and the day this year we did it we are hungry if possible find a donor 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.530
 the most beautiful product how do you want little bit before the 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.320
 lift-off 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.970
 a way of salvation is always the same if the concerts begin 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.320
 the goal is untimely find themselves in the studio to record something I 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.320
 go 2011 

00:02:18.679 --> 00:02:20.369
 with the return of the group 

00:02:20.369 --> 00:02:24.729
 these are basically these are the roots of the 40 th hometown 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:30.269
 a person is dead 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:33.269
 group like all the viktor comesa like black sabbath 

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:37.329
 in front of him will wear on the piece their bodies 

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:48.799
 people died at puy-en-velay 

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:52.979
 so I speak and we undergo 

00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:55.959
 a brothers mention 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:03:00.379
 replanting upper margins of the former staff in the future a 

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:01.749
 battle 

00:03:01.749 --> 00:03:04.749
 but she admitted we found the biggest problem 

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:08.219
 Sunday 3 

00:03:08.219 --> 00:03:10.919
 this is a third country 

00:03:10.919 --> 00:03:14.119
 everything has changed between nîmes and alès 

00:03:14.119 --> 00:03:16.029
 the way it works now 

00:03:16.029 --> 00:03:19.089

00:03:27.759 --> 00:03:29.659
 to go back to finding 

00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:32.659
