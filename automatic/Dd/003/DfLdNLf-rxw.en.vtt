 video tutorial I just wanted to give you 

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:30.090
 I wanted to tell you just a few 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.220
 more information about it 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.820
 at the meeting to be held in Naples on 7 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:36.630
 May 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:39.720
 then we will be marta 10 buti 1990 e 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:42.300
 maria 8 then fatima the appointment 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:44.760
 precisely for Tuesday 7 May at 17.00 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.200
 and 30 at the exit of the course gallery 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.830
 umberto primo 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.960
 so we'll be the three of us really 

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:54.720
 very happy indeed if we really are 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:58.230
 happy if any of you 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:59.550
 come on let's move on to the trick then it's a 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.740
 very strong trick 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:05.100
 I know that I surely realize it is not 

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:06.290
 it's the kind for so many of you though 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.900
 however it can be resized 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:14.040
 obviously putting on a lip gloss 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:15.570
 however a nude lipstick is obviously 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.520
 removing false eyelashes 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.340
 I wanted to make the makeup a lot more 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.420
 dramatic for precisely you can 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.830
 resize it according to yours 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.960
 tastes 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:28.410
 with this brush here of others the 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:32.759
 adviser the velino synthetic bristles 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:34.470
 but I will immediately fade the pencil ourselves 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:37.020
 no but that falls on the dry easily 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.909
 so you have to use it as a base 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:44.819
 you must blend it immediately 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:47.229
 yes yes fixed and you can no longer blend it 

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:49.689
 you may like this trick 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:51.880
 so I leave you to the realization 

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:53.859
 for all the others for all color 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:56.380

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:59.649

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:29.150
 small brush of zero and fades it all 

00:05:35.099 --> 00:05:40.329

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:28.760
 can apply the gate and bohemian 

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:32.210

 liked the combination with a lipstick 

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:25.520
