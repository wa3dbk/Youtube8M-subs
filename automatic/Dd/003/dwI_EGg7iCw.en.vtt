00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
we've got here we can see we've got

we've got here we can see we've got
loads<00:00:48.180> of<00:00:48.449> notes<00:00:48.600> all<00:00:48.900> here<00:00:49.170> and<00:00:50.300> if<00:00:51.300> we<00:00:51.330> play

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
loads of notes all here and if we play

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.250 
loads of notes all here and if we play
that<00:00:53.000> that's<00:00:54.000> a<00:00:54.120> snare<00:00:54.390> roll<00:00:54.660> but<00:00:54.870> we<00:00:54.960> wanted

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
that that's a snare roll but we wanted

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.079 
that that's a snare roll but we wanted
to<00:00:55.379> build<00:00:55.589> up<00:00:55.769> and<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.519> first<00:00:56.730> thing<00:00:56.879> to<00:00:57.000> make

00:00:57.079 --> 00:00:57.089 
to build up and the first thing to make

00:00:57.089 --> 00:00:58.969 
to build up and the first thing to make
it<00:00:57.239> build<00:00:57.420> up<00:00:57.570> we<00:00:58.110> want<00:00:58.260> to<00:00:58.350> make<00:00:58.500> it<00:00:58.619> speed<00:00:58.949> up

00:00:58.969 --> 00:00:58.979 
it build up we want to make it speed up

00:00:58.979 --> 00:01:02.090 
it build up we want to make it speed up
as<00:00:59.309> it<00:00:59.640> carries<00:00:59.940> on<00:01:00.059> so<00:01:00.659> at<00:01:01.350> this<00:01:01.530> section<00:01:01.949> near

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
as it carries on so at this section near

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.899 
as it carries on so at this section near
the<00:01:02.129> end<00:01:02.400> here<00:01:02.839> I'm<00:01:03.839> going<00:01:04.140> to<00:01:04.229> zoom<00:01:04.470> in<00:01:05.600> and

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:07.909 
the end here I'm going to zoom in and

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:14.570 
the end here I'm going to zoom in and
then<00:01:09.590> select<00:01:10.590> all<00:01:10.799> these<00:01:10.979> notes<00:01:13.369> make<00:01:14.369> sure

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
then select all these notes make sure

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.910 
then select all these notes make sure
I'm<00:01:14.700> on<00:01:14.820> 30<00:01:15.360> seconds<00:01:15.900> zooming<00:01:16.680> it<00:01:16.770> a<00:01:16.799> little

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
I'm on 30 seconds zooming it a little

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.230 
I'm on 30 seconds zooming it a little
bit<00:01:17.070> more<00:01:17.220> so<00:01:17.400> I<00:01:17.430> can<00:01:17.549> see<00:01:17.729> more<00:01:17.850> accurately

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
bit more so I can see more accurately

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.969 
bit more so I can see more accurately
and<00:01:18.619> then<00:01:19.619> copy<00:01:20.510> these<00:01:21.510> by<00:01:21.990> ctrl-clicking<00:01:22.439> on

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
and then copy these by ctrl-clicking on

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.039 
and then copy these by ctrl-clicking on
Windows<00:01:23.580> and<00:01:23.790> not<00:01:23.880> already<00:01:24.150> as<00:01:24.240> a<00:01:24.299> Mac<00:01:24.570> command

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
Windows and not already as a Mac command

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.050 
Windows and not already as a Mac command
clicking<00:01:25.350> I<00:01:25.560> assume<00:01:25.830> and<00:01:25.979> dragging<00:01:26.790> and<00:01:27.000> then

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
clicking I assume and dragging and then

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.690 
clicking I assume and dragging and then
deselecting<00:01:27.960> so<00:01:28.890> we've<00:01:29.040> got<00:01:29.190> this<00:01:29.370> speeding

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
deselecting so we've got this speeding

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.100 
deselecting so we've got this speeding
up<00:01:29.940> as<00:01:30.120> it<00:01:30.240> goes<00:01:30.270> along<00:01:30.600> so<00:01:30.630> let's<00:01:30.930> take<00:01:31.080> a

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
up as it goes along so let's take a

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.090 
up as it goes along so let's take a
listen<00:01:31.320> to<00:01:31.440> how<00:01:31.530> that<00:01:31.680> speeds<00:01:32.070> up<00:01:32.250> so<00:01:33.210> it'll<00:01:33.450> be

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
listen to how that speeds up so it'll be

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.719 
listen to how that speeds up so it'll be
normal<00:01:35.100> speed

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.490 

and<00:01:39.119> then<00:01:39.390> it<00:01:39.479> will<00:01:39.570> crash<00:01:39.810> into<00:01:40.200> our<00:01:40.229> beat

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
and then it will crash into our beat

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.230 
and then it will crash into our beat
there<00:01:40.969> nice

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
there nice

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.399 
there nice
now<00:01:42.689> for<00:01:42.930> the<00:01:43.020> reverb<00:01:43.409> I<00:01:45.020> just<00:01:46.020> move<00:01:46.140> this<00:01:46.229> up

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
now for the reverb I just move this up

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:47.959 
now for the reverb I just move this up
the<00:01:46.530> top<00:01:46.710> here<00:01:46.890> so<00:01:47.070> we<00:01:47.159> can<00:01:47.280> see<00:01:47.429> more<00:01:47.549> clearly

00:01:47.959 --> 00:01:47.969 
the top here so we can see more clearly

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:50.300 
the top here so we can see more clearly
I<00:01:48.000> liked<00:01:48.450> this<00:01:48.659> healings<00:01:49.140> whole<00:01:49.469> presets<00:01:50.130> just

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
I liked this healings whole presets just

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.550 
I liked this healings whole presets just
with<00:01:50.610> the<00:01:50.700> default<00:01:51.060> values<00:01:51.479> now<00:01:52.140> to<00:01:52.200> apply

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
with the default values now to apply

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.590 
with the default values now to apply
this<00:01:52.619> reverb<00:01:53.070> turn<00:01:53.549> the<00:01:53.670> auxiliary<00:01:54.090> knob<00:01:54.420> to

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
this reverb turn the auxiliary knob to

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.359 
this reverb turn the auxiliary knob to
about<00:01:54.810> five<00:01:55.049> eighths<00:01:55.259> of<00:01:55.439> the<00:01:55.530> way<00:01:55.679> around<00:01:56.009> and

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
about five eighths of the way around and

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.600 
about five eighths of the way around and
if<00:01:56.579> we<00:01:56.670> take<00:01:56.789> a<00:01:56.850> listen<00:01:57.030> to<00:01:57.179> that<00:01:58.159> nice<00:01:59.159> and<00:01:59.399> big

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
if we take a listen to that nice and big

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.510 
if we take a listen to that nice and big
sounding<00:02:00.149> sweet<00:02:01.020> so<00:02:01.740> now<00:02:01.860> we've<00:02:01.979> got<00:02:02.130> a<00:02:02.159> snare

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
sounding sweet so now we've got a snare

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.219 
sounding sweet so now we've got a snare
all<00:02:02.670> sorted<00:02:03.090> we<00:02:03.420> want<00:02:03.600> to<00:02:03.659> make<00:02:03.810> it<00:02:03.929> build<00:02:04.140> up

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
all sorted we want to make it build up

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:05.809 
all sorted we want to make it build up
in<00:02:04.409> volume<00:02:04.799> so<00:02:04.829> I'm<00:02:05.100> going<00:02:05.280> to<00:02:05.340> quickly<00:02:05.520> make<00:02:05.759> a
