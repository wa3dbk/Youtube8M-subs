special<00:01:00.100> about<00:01:00.310> this<00:01:00.550> project<00:01:01.030> for<00:01:01.300> you<00:01:01.420> as<00:01:01.570> a

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:01.600 
special about this project for you as a

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.369 
special about this project for you as a
curator<00:01:02.280> well<00:01:03.280> you<00:01:03.760> know<00:01:03.880> doing<00:01:04.689> public<00:01:05.170> art

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:05.379 
curator well you know doing public art

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:07.770 
curator well you know doing public art
is<00:01:05.590> very<00:01:06.340> different<00:01:06.610> from<00:01:06.880> working<00:01:07.630> in<00:01:07.689> a

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:07.780 
is very different from working in a

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:09.960 
is very different from working in a
museum<00:01:08.079> or<00:01:08.320> gallery<00:01:08.380> and<00:01:08.890> my<00:01:09.009> experience<00:01:09.790> was

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:09.970 
museum or gallery and my experience was

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:13.169 
museum or gallery and my experience was
actually<00:01:10.509> more<00:01:10.890> in<00:01:11.890> non-profit<00:01:12.490> spaces<00:01:13.030> in

00:01:13.169 --> 00:01:13.179 
actually more in non-profit spaces in

00:01:13.179 --> 00:01:17.489 
actually more in non-profit spaces in
museums<00:01:13.600> and<00:01:14.069> I<00:01:15.069> think<00:01:15.729> also<00:01:15.880> doing<00:01:16.780> art<00:01:17.200> on

00:01:17.489 --> 00:01:17.499 
museums and I think also doing art on

00:01:17.499 --> 00:01:19.410 
museums and I think also doing art on
the<00:01:17.590> high<00:01:17.770> line<00:01:17.799> is<00:01:18.369> is<00:01:18.670> really<00:01:18.969> unique

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:19.420 
the high line is is really unique

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:22.980 
the high line is is really unique
because<00:01:19.749> it's<00:01:20.259> unlike<00:01:20.770> any<00:01:20.950> other<00:01:21.159> part<00:01:21.990> it's

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:22.990 
because it's unlike any other part it's

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:25.949 
because it's unlike any other part it's
really<00:01:23.770> very<00:01:24.609> special<00:01:25.149> and<00:01:25.299> it's<00:01:25.450> designed

00:01:25.949 --> 00:01:25.959 
really very special and it's designed

00:01:25.959 --> 00:01:28.020 
really very special and it's designed
and<00:01:26.259> it's<00:01:26.350> layout<00:01:26.560> and<00:01:26.889> its<00:01:27.039> structure<00:01:27.340> it's

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.030 
and it's layout and its structure it's

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.830 
and it's layout and its structure it's
unlike<00:01:28.479> any<00:01:28.689> other<00:01:28.869> space<00:01:29.609> and<00:01:30.609> you<00:01:31.359> know<00:01:31.479> one

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:31.840 
unlike any other space and you know one

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.179 
unlike any other space and you know one
of<00:01:31.869> the<00:01:31.990> interesting<00:01:32.229> things<00:01:32.590> about<00:01:32.709> the<00:01:33.069> high

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:33.189 
of the interesting things about the high

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:35.039 
of the interesting things about the high
line<00:01:33.429> is<00:01:33.609> that<00:01:33.819> the<00:01:34.090> line<00:01:34.270> between<00:01:34.479> public<00:01:34.959> and

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:35.049 
line is that the line between public and

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:36.899 
line is that the line between public and
private<00:01:35.139> space<00:01:35.560> is<00:01:35.799> very<00:01:35.979> thin<00:01:36.369> you<00:01:36.729> know<00:01:36.850> you

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:36.909 
private space is very thin you know you

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:38.699 
private space is very thin you know you
have<00:01:37.179> this<00:01:37.420> structure<00:01:38.020> that<00:01:38.289> literally

00:01:38.699 --> 00:01:38.709 
have this structure that literally

00:01:38.709 --> 00:01:41.069 
have this structure that literally
passes<00:01:39.189> through<00:01:39.490> or<00:01:40.209> underneath<00:01:40.509> buildings

00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:41.079 
passes through or underneath buildings

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:45.569 
passes through or underneath buildings
in<00:01:41.229> certain<00:01:41.499> places<00:01:41.619> and<00:01:43.350> the<00:01:44.350> it's<00:01:45.249> not<00:01:45.399> an

00:01:45.569 --> 00:01:45.579 
in certain places and the it's not an

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:47.069 
in certain places and the it's not an
enclosed<00:01:45.939> space<00:01:46.060> really<00:01:46.539> when<00:01:46.689> you're<00:01:46.810> when

00:01:47.069 --> 00:01:47.079 
enclosed space really when you're when

00:01:47.079 --> 00:01:48.809 
enclosed space really when you're when
you're<00:01:47.200> in<00:01:47.350> the<00:01:47.439> park<00:01:47.709> the<00:01:48.009> experience<00:01:48.520> is

00:01:48.809 --> 00:01:48.819 
you're in the park the experience is

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:50.999 
you're in the park the experience is
about<00:01:49.209> the<00:01:49.810> city<00:01:50.079> that's<00:01:50.350> surrounding<00:01:50.859> you

00:01:50.999 --> 00:01:51.009 
about the city that's surrounding you

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:52.739 
about the city that's surrounding you
you<00:01:51.310> know<00:01:51.429> the<00:01:51.549> park<00:01:51.939> is<00:01:52.090> so<00:01:52.209> beautiful<00:01:52.630> and

00:01:52.739 --> 00:01:52.749 
you know the park is so beautiful and

00:01:52.749 --> 00:01:56.279 
you know the park is so beautiful and
the<00:01:52.840> plantings<00:01:53.259> in<00:01:53.380> the<00:01:53.499> design<00:01:53.829> but<00:01:54.719> the<00:01:55.719> it

00:01:56.279 --> 00:01:56.289 
the plantings in the design but the it

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:57.719 
the plantings in the design but the it
really<00:01:56.590> is<00:01:56.649> a<00:01:56.740> line<00:01:56.950> between<00:01:57.219> the<00:01:57.429> park<00:01:57.609> in

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:57.729 
really is a line between the park in

00:01:57.729 --> 00:01:59.069 
really is a line between the park in
this<00:01:57.849> rounding<00:01:58.149> space<00:01:58.389> is<00:01:58.689> almost

00:01:59.069 --> 00:01:59.079 
this rounding space is almost

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:01.739 
this rounding space is almost
non-existent<00:01:59.380> and<00:02:00.159> so<00:02:00.819> I<00:02:01.090> think<00:02:01.209> the<00:02:01.599> public

00:02:01.739 --> 00:02:01.749 
non-existent and so I think the public

00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:03.719 
non-existent and so I think the public
art<00:02:02.020> program<00:02:02.170> really<00:02:02.619> needs<00:02:03.099> to<00:02:03.310> be<00:02:03.429> similar

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
across the street from the park and I'm

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:27.970 
across the street from the park and I'm
really<00:02:27.170> excited<00:02:27.349> about<00:02:27.590> this<00:02:27.680> project

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
really excited about this project

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.220 
really excited about this project
because<00:02:28.250> we're<00:02:28.579> we're<00:02:29.150> moving<00:02:29.480> off<00:02:29.599> of<00:02:29.810> park

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
because we're we're moving off of park

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:32.199 
because we're we're moving off of park
property<00:02:30.560> and<00:02:31.069> into<00:02:31.400> the<00:02:31.519> neighborhood<00:02:32.000> and

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:32.209 
property and into the neighborhood and

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:34.809 
property and into the neighborhood and
as<00:02:33.019> I<00:02:33.140> said<00:02:33.200> it's<00:02:33.620> really<00:02:34.069> so<00:02:34.340> appropriate

00:02:34.809 --> 00:02:34.819 
as I said it's really so appropriate

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:36.429 
as I said it's really so appropriate
because<00:02:34.970> the<00:02:35.209> experience<00:02:35.780> here<00:02:36.079> on<00:02:36.200> the<00:02:36.319> high

00:02:36.429 --> 00:02:36.439 
because the experience here on the high

00:02:36.439 --> 00:02:39.030 
because the experience here on the high
line<00:02:36.470> is<00:02:36.950> about<00:02:37.670> the<00:02:38.209> neighborhood<00:02:38.659> as<00:02:38.840> well

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
line is about the neighborhood as well

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.960 
line is about the neighborhood as well

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
how many on projects security realize um

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:46.599 
how many on projects security realize um

that<00:03:04.099> that<00:03:04.790> are<00:03:04.909> really<00:03:05.419> unique<00:03:05.569> to<00:03:05.900> the

00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:06.019 
that that are really unique to the

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:08.920 
that that are really unique to the
organization<00:03:07.090> so<00:03:08.090> the<00:03:08.209> future<00:03:08.540> of<00:03:08.720> the<00:03:08.750> High

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
organization so the future of the High

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:11.860 
organization so the future of the High
Line<00:03:09.109> because<00:03:09.739> it's<00:03:10.040> gets<00:03:10.519> extended<00:03:11.239> I<00:03:11.629> think

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
Line because it's gets extended I think

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:15.610 
Line because it's gets extended I think
in<00:03:12.019> in<00:03:12.260> a<00:03:12.730> Hamas<00:03:14.019> that's<00:03:15.019> correct<00:03:15.260> we're

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
in in a Hamas that's correct we're

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.099 
in in a Hamas that's correct we're
expanding<00:03:16.159> the<00:03:16.459> park<00:03:16.669> right<00:03:16.909> now<00:03:17.120> the<00:03:17.690> the

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:20.959 
section one and it's the equivalent of

park<00:03:32.120> will<00:03:32.269> be<00:03:32.299> a<00:03:32.389> mile<00:03:32.629> long<00:03:33.010> is<00:03:34.010> it<00:03:34.220> difficult

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:34.400 
park will be a mile long is it difficult

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.219 
park will be a mile long is it difficult
to<00:03:34.760> sometimes<00:03:35.030> to<00:03:35.359> realize<00:03:35.750> the<00:03:35.900> projects

00:03:36.219 --> 00:03:36.229 
to sometimes to realize the projects

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:37.869 
to sometimes to realize the projects
because<00:03:36.440> as<00:03:36.889> you<00:03:37.069> said<00:03:37.220> it's<00:03:37.459> middle<00:03:37.760> in<00:03:37.819> the

00:03:37.869 --> 00:03:37.879 
because as you said it's middle in the

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:41.369 
because as you said it's middle in the
city<00:03:38.120> and<00:03:38.299> I<00:03:38.750> guess<00:03:38.989> there's<00:03:39.229> some<00:03:39.440> some<00:03:40.299> legal

00:03:41.369 --> 00:03:41.379 
city and I guess there's some some legal

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:45.550 
city and I guess there's some some legal
the<00:03:42.379> things<00:03:43.010> to<00:03:43.099> get<00:03:43.280> to<00:03:43.489> consider<00:03:44.260> how<00:03:45.260> do<00:03:45.470> you

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:45.560 
the things to get to consider how do you

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.589 
the things to get to consider how do you
get<00:03:45.709> along<00:03:45.799> with<00:03:46.010> this<00:03:46.159> it<00:03:46.609> is<00:03:47.030> challenging

00:03:47.589 --> 00:03:47.599 
get along with this it is challenging

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:49.960 
get along with this it is challenging
working<00:03:48.379> in<00:03:48.500> the<00:03:48.590> public<00:03:48.709> realm<00:03:49.040> more<00:03:49.699> so<00:03:49.940> I

working in the public realm more so I

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:53.979 
working in the public realm more so I

we're working on several projects right

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:59.520 
we're working on several projects right
now<00:04:56.920> one<00:04:57.880> of<00:04:57.910> the<00:04:58.180> aspects<00:04:58.930> of<00:04:59.020> high<00:04:59.170> line<00:04:59.380> art

00:04:59.520 --> 00:04:59.530 
now one of the aspects of high line art

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:01.740 
now one of the aspects of high line art
that's<00:04:59.680> really<00:04:59.980> important<00:05:00.370> to<00:05:00.430> us<00:05:00.460> is<00:05:00.790> that<00:05:01.030> it

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:01.750 
that's really important to us is that it

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:03.750 
that's really important to us is that it
incorporates<00:05:02.020> a<00:05:02.530> wide<00:05:02.770> variety<00:05:02.950> of<00:05:03.280> mediums

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:03.760 
incorporates a wide variety of mediums

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:05.610 
incorporates a wide variety of mediums

so I think you know what most people

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:06.840 
so I think you know what most people
think<00:05:05.680> of<00:05:05.830> public<00:05:06.130> art<00:05:06.250> they<00:05:06.520> think<00:05:06.760> of

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:06.850 
think of public art they think of

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:09.090 
think of public art they think of
sculpture<00:05:07.270> but<00:05:07.570> and<00:05:08.290> we<00:05:08.440> certainly<00:05:08.620> have<00:05:08.920> done

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:09.100 
sculpture but and we certainly have done

so for work but we want the program to

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:16.050 
so for work but we want the program to
be<00:05:12.280> very<00:05:12.930> very<00:05:13.930> broad<00:05:14.260> ranging<00:05:14.740> so<00:05:15.700> we've<00:05:15.850> done
