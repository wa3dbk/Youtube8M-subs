 latest e - book readers 

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:08.540

00:00:05.959 --> 00:00:11.240
 that you see here the papyre 630 of grammata 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:12.920
 which has a price of 119 euros that 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:14.990
 this book reader has special 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:17.390
 electronic good its feature more 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:19.250
 highlighted is the screen because as 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:20.660
 you can see is an ink screen 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:21.830
 electronics that you already know all 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:23.210
 benefits you have when reading 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:24.650
 like no house in sight and that 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:27.289
 can read that light perfectly 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:30.560
 with a series of lights that are 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:32.960
 placed around the screen and 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:34.579
 what they do is illuminate the without 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.069
 Let the light go to our eyes with which 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:38.390
 we can read when we do not have the light 

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:40.630
 very strong 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:43.330
 in the dark even 

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:45.490
 and continues without tiring the view we are going to 

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:47.870
 teach how it works because this reader 

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:50.500
 It allows 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:53.570
 that we adjust in the levels as you see 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:55.280
 if we click on the bottom of 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:58.640
 the 6 inch screen and it 's touch 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:00.710
 one of the icons is that of light and 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:03.110
 right now it would be at maximum and 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:08.050
 sliding then for example we put it 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:08.050
 at 1 or we could remove all 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.850
 there it is and it would already be a screen of 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:16.159
 traditional electronic ink like 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:18.229
 we say many benefits when it comes to 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:20.750
 read the screen you have already seen that it is 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:22.790
 tactile and reacts very well to the 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.500
 touch but have one thing to me 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:27.590
 I especially liked it a lot 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:29.270
 that combines that tactile control with ones 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:32.659
 physical controls located in the 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:35.240
 laterals to update to advance 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:36.770
 and to go back and have them in both 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.810
 sides in such a way that we can 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.580
 use them with just one hand and both 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.390
 with the right hand as with the 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:45.960
 left 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:48.840
 as you can see when displaying the bottom menu 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:52.380
 there are other options to go to the screen 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:55.050
 main or for example 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:58.560
 make some adjustments 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:02:02.450
 look for words choose the lens that 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.450
 we want the letter forgiveness we want 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:08.660
 the separation between lines all 

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:11.630
