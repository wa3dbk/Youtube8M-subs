but yeah this you know just two quick

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:25.509 
but yeah this you know just two quick
seed<00:02:23.659> like<00:02:24.590> I<00:02:24.680> say<00:02:24.829> people<00:02:25.069> are<00:02:25.189> always<00:02:25.370> asking

00:02:25.509 --> 00:02:25.519 
seed like I say people are always asking

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:28.319 
seed like I say people are always asking
about<00:02:25.849> glaciers<00:02:26.329> and<00:02:26.870> mystic<00:02:27.230> grows<00:02:27.470> so<00:02:27.920> I

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:28.329 
about glaciers and mystic grows so I

00:02:28.329 --> 00:02:32.309 
about glaciers and mystic grows so I
figured<00:02:29.329> since<00:02:29.510> you<00:02:29.780> spawn<00:02:30.140> in<00:02:30.620> one<00:02:31.459> like

00:02:32.309 --> 00:02:32.319 
figured since you spawn in one like

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:34.809 
figured since you spawn in one like
literally<00:02:33.319> ten<00:02:33.680> blocks<00:02:34.010> away<00:02:34.220> from<00:02:34.340> another

00:02:34.809 --> 00:02:34.819
