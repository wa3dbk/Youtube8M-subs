00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:12.660
 hello to all boys are more ayo 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.509
 review 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:18.619
 today I wanted to show you a little one 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:21.750
 modification I made to my new drone 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:24.359
 practically with this change thing 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:27.840
 we can do normally we can 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:30.300
 drive yes to iphone and ipad 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.189
 our drone directly from ours 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.079
 device 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.780
 then our device that is i 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:39.480
 paddock and both an iphone has a reach 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.309
 maximum of about 50 meters as a range 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.000
 of the wifi 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:46.969
 there are methods to amplify 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.530
 the distance with which we can drive it 

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:53.579
 one of these methods is the ranges 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:57.570
 extender then I'll show you I have 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:59.760
 bought this guy is a little bit 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.699
 used both as a router or can be 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:05.070
 used as the range extender it is 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:07.260
 the advantage of using this this 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.000
 here is a is a tp link first 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.670
 boys should be one of the last 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.590
 models in fact I took what 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.500
 I think it was with the features 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:19.380
 that I read the best because there 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.180
 allows up to about 250 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.409
 meters away 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.990
 this is usually used here 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.939
 in the big houses when 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.040
 we have an apartment on two 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:32.090
 plans that we want to use the same 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:34.490
 wifi network and we want 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:36.979
 take well even above you use 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:39.759
 one of these simply by connecting it 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:43.159
 to the current and we do nothing but 

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:46.219
 configure it as a bridge that serves as a 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:48.469
 communication bridge so that we 

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:49.429
 we can also navigate quickly 

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:52.459
 upstairs 

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:53.509
 I did what guys did configured 

00:01:52.459 --> 00:01:56.539
 this 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:58.069
 tp link with mine with my drone 

00:01:56.539 --> 00:02:01.429
 going to put the same ip address 

00:01:58.069 --> 00:02:03.289
 which uses the drone so that in 

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:07.789
 automatic when I go now 

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:10.340
 turn on and connect directly to the 

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:13.849
 my drone turn on my ipad yes 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:16.400
 connects in turn to him and allows me 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:19.879
 to get up to 250 meters but the thing 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:21.920
 important what is beyond the distance is 

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:24.079
 that as disk height I succeeded 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.530
 get guys at 100 meters I do 

00:02:24.079 --> 00:02:30.650
 see the drawing here right away 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:32.329
 and as you see on the left we have in 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:35.090
 real time 

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:36.859
 the height from the ground I am now 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:40.040
 left from the roof of a car and it is 

00:02:36.859 --> 00:02:42.410
 that's why he didn't start from scratch on 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.880
 right above we have this is 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:46.549
 the application interface with 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.959
 the one so pilot on the right we love 

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:50.239
 how do you see the battery percentage 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:53.510
 that falls dramatically also because 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:57.109
 it's going up pretty fast 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:58.940
 immediately below we have the speed in 

00:02:57.109 --> 00:03:01.940
 km per hour 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:05.180
 and below we have the graph that there 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:09.560
 indicates how you can see the green line 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:12.290
 that would be me with the drone in question is 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:14.750
 the red line of the graph indicating a 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:17.090
 exaggerated surge because I'm going up 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:19.310
 echoed normally with 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:21.889
 however, our ipad will not have arrived 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:24.889
 at this height more or less get there 46 

00:03:21.889 --> 00:03:28.430
 47 no more I managed to do like 

00:03:24.889 --> 00:03:30.829
 see we are already at 74 meters 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:34.609
 I would say that already begins to be seen 

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:36.530
 a lot 80 meters in short boys are 

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:39.470
 managed to reach the height of 100 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:42.530
 I guarantee that the drone 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:45.140
 unless you look 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:46.940
 the monitor hardly makes effort 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:49.910
 just to see it 100 meters high 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:53.150
 that is, if you get distracted for a moment you risk 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:55.910
 not to see him again, luckily at least 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:59.540
 there is the option to land that at least a 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:04:01.790
 earth and shows us where nothing is 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:04.489
 boys this was a small one 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:06.520
 demonstration to show that 

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:10.280
 however there are methods to expand 

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:14.180
 our range obviously this with a 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:16.790
 ios device because it marks to take 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:18.530
 there are people in the field of professional remote controls 

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:20.000
 that a mile or so has arrived 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:23.330
 I sincerely want to use in my own 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:26.419
 buzz and this is the second me is for me 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:30.580
 already the top and nothing thanks to the vision 

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:30.580
 guys and the next hello
