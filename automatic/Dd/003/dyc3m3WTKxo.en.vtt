00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:22.960
 the answer to the question how the fight is played 

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:22.960
 song ceiling ddt group 

00:00:24.489 --> 00:00:31.200
 Here's a fight that is up and down 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:37.280
 click 

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:37.280
 and then down down 3 that is 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:45.829
 and top over try yourself there 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:49.989
 I will not draw the scheme again 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:54.690
 here is the first part that is up-down 

00:00:49.989 --> 00:01:01.219
 right click and then down 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:01.219
 up-down and a-ta-ta overhead light 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:12.600
 four chords played fast 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:15.420
 d to our 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:20.990
 is it already possible here for those who are 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.990
 guys can play well be played like this 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:32.420
 try slowly 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
 but 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:47.290
 once again slowly the whole fight 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.800
 again 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:01.390
 here will be and how to sing but I will not 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:03.520
 sing the whole song I will sing there a piece with 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:06.130
 the first verse is some part of 2 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:10.380
 and at the first to understand the date was 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.380
 the question is how to lay out the photo 

00:02:18.109 --> 00:02:26.299
 so a little bit gone 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.500
 you cut down the box 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:39.900
 yes the lamp has burned down 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:43.920
 maybe 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:46.340
 not a single line 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.340
 few 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:57.470
 and my either 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:17.420
 goes home. 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:20.970
 but 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:38.460
 it said nothing to the brakes and 

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:40.580
 came up with panties which 

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:40.580
 they 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:16.470
 in general, something like this to us again 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:19.620
 someone has joined something is not clear here 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:22.320

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:28.310
