you<00:01:06.880> know<00:01:06.970> what's<00:01:07.270> going<00:01:07.540> on<00:01:07.660> in<00:01:07.930> between

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:08.320 
you know what's going on in between

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.469 
you know what's going on in between
these<00:01:08.950> two<00:01:09.160> ears<00:01:09.460> right<00:01:09.700> here<00:01:09.940> you<00:01:10.119> know<00:01:10.150> can

00:01:10.469 --> 00:01:10.479 
these two ears right here you know can

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:12.540 
these two ears right here you know can
get<00:01:11.110> in<00:01:11.229> the<00:01:11.259> way<00:01:11.410> of<00:01:11.560> so<00:01:11.770> many<00:01:11.979> of<00:01:12.280> our

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:12.550 
get in the way of so many of our

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:14.249 
get in the way of so many of our
students<00:01:12.940> competing<00:01:13.479> so<00:01:13.690> I<00:01:13.720> think<00:01:13.840> the<00:01:14.080> big

00:01:14.249 --> 00:01:14.259 
students competing so I think the big

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:16.499 
students competing so I think the big
thing<00:01:14.290> is<00:01:14.520> that<00:01:15.520> you<00:01:15.759> know<00:01:15.790> we<00:01:16.240> have<00:01:16.360> the

thing is that you know we have the

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:18.540 
thing is that you know we have the
ability<00:01:16.900> to<00:01:16.930> coach<00:01:17.770> our<00:01:17.950> students<00:01:18.369> not<00:01:18.520> only

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:18.550 
ability to coach our students not only

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:20.820 
ability to coach our students not only
