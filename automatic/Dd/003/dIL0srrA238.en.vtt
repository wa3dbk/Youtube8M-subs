let's<00:00:05.360> talk<00:00:05.600> about<00:00:05.750> some<00:00:06.080> basics<00:00:06.500> about<00:00:06.590> how

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:06.770 
let's talk about some basics about how

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:08.980 
let's talk about some basics about how
an<00:00:07.040> Australian<00:00:07.580> saddle<00:00:08.000> should<00:00:08.149> fit<00:00:08.389> for<00:00:08.840> you

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:08.990 
an Australian saddle should fit for you

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:11.320 
an Australian saddle should fit for you
and<00:00:09.290> your<00:00:09.590> horse<00:00:09.820> when<00:00:10.820> you<00:00:10.940> sit<00:00:11.120> in<00:00:11.240> an

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:11.330 
and your horse when you sit in an

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:13.060 
and your horse when you sit in an
Australian<00:00:11.690> saddle<00:00:12.320> with<00:00:12.470> your<00:00:12.620> feet<00:00:12.830> in<00:00:12.980> the

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:13.070 
Australian saddle with your feet in the

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:14.560 
Australian saddle with your feet in the
stirrups<00:00:13.460> there<00:00:13.820> should<00:00:14.000> be<00:00:14.090> about<00:00:14.210> one

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:14.570 
stirrups there should be about one

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:16.330 
stirrups there should be about one
quarter<00:00:15.019> inch<00:00:15.200> to<00:00:15.530> one<00:00:15.679> inch<00:00:15.710> distance

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:16.340 
quarter inch to one inch distance

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:18.580 
quarter inch to one inch distance
between<00:00:16.550> the<00:00:16.820> pulleys<00:00:17.210> and<00:00:17.360> your<00:00:17.480> thighs<00:00:17.720> you

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:18.590 
between the pulleys and your thighs you

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:19.750 
between the pulleys and your thighs you
should<00:00:18.770> be<00:00:18.860> able<00:00:18.950> to<00:00:19.130> slide<00:00:19.340> your<00:00:19.550> hand

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:19.760 
should be able to slide your hand

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:21.939 
should be able to slide your hand
between<00:00:19.970> your<00:00:20.180> thighs<00:00:20.510> and<00:00:20.539> the<00:00:20.840> pulley<00:00:21.050> it's

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:21.949 
between your thighs and the pulley it's

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:23.590 
between your thighs and the pulley it's
a<00:00:22.010> personal<00:00:22.400> preference<00:00:22.640> on<00:00:22.939> exactly<00:00:23.480> how

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:23.600 
a personal preference on exactly how

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.269 
a personal preference on exactly how
close<00:00:23.779> you<00:00:24.050> are<00:00:24.080> but<00:00:24.560> if<00:00:24.680> you're<00:00:24.800> too<00:00:24.920> far<00:00:24.949> away

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:25.279 
close you are but if you're too far away

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:27.400 
close you are but if you're too far away
you'll<00:00:25.580> lose<00:00:25.760> the<00:00:25.910> advantage<00:00:26.000> of<00:00:26.570> the<00:00:26.990> pulleys

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:27.410 
you'll lose the advantage of the pulleys

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:29.410 
you'll lose the advantage of the pulleys
the<00:00:27.619> idea<00:00:28.400> is<00:00:28.519> that<00:00:28.670> the<00:00:28.789> pulley<00:00:29.000> should<00:00:29.180> be

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:29.420 
the idea is that the pulley should be

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:31.060 
the idea is that the pulley should be
close<00:00:29.660> enough<00:00:29.689> to<00:00:30.109> come<00:00:30.260> into<00:00:30.410> play<00:00:30.650> quickly

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:31.070 
close enough to come into play quickly

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:32.890 
close enough to come into play quickly
when<00:00:31.220> you<00:00:31.340> need<00:00:31.490> them<00:00:31.699> but<00:00:32.239> far<00:00:32.540> enough<00:00:32.750> away

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:32.900 
when you need them but far enough away

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:34.900 
when you need them but far enough away
so<00:00:33.290> that<00:00:33.470> your<00:00:33.680> thighs<00:00:33.920> do<00:00:34.160> not<00:00:34.309> rub<00:00:34.519> on<00:00:34.699> them

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:34.910 
so that your thighs do not rub on them

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:37.299 
so that your thighs do not rub on them
as<00:00:35.030> you're<00:00:35.330> riding<00:00:35.530> your<00:00:36.530> legs<00:00:36.829> should<00:00:37.100> be<00:00:37.219> at

as you're riding your legs should be at

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:38.860 
as you're riding your legs should be at
approximately<00:00:37.520> the<00:00:38.000> same<00:00:38.059> angle<00:00:38.630> as<00:00:38.750> the

approximately the same angle as the

approximately the same angle as the
