is a Ledge and on that ledge is a little

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.959 
is a Ledge and on that ledge is a little
red<00:00:45.180> ball<00:00:45.360> and<00:00:45.660> as<00:00:46.469> the<00:00:46.649> spiral<00:00:47.039> turns<00:00:47.340> over<00:00:47.610> 12

red ball and as the spiral turns over 12

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.360 
red ball and as the spiral turns over 12
hours<00:00:48.239> that<00:00:48.450> little<00:00:48.960> ball<00:00:49.140> magically<00:00:49.590> travels

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
hours that little ball magically travels

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.880 
hours that little ball magically travels
up<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:50.610> spiral<00:00:50.850> to<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.180> center<00:00:51.570> and<00:00:51.770> when<00:00:52.770> it

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
up the spiral to the center and when it

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.709 
up the spiral to the center and when it
gets<00:00:52.949> the<00:00:53.160> center<00:00:53.460> after<00:00:53.579> 12<00:00:53.910> hours<00:00:54.090> it<00:00:54.329> plops

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
gets the center after 12 hours it plops

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.779 
gets the center after 12 hours it plops
through<00:00:55.020> a<00:00:55.260> hole<00:00:55.530> in<00:00:55.559> the<00:00:55.890> middle<00:00:56.010> and<00:00:56.219> begins

through a hole in the middle and begins

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.250 
through a hole in the middle and begins
its<00:00:56.879> journey<00:00:56.969> again<00:00:57.270> and<00:00:57.660> we'll<00:00:57.809> see<00:00:57.989> in<00:00:58.170> a<00:00:58.230> bit

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
its journey again and we'll see in a bit

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.110 
its journey again and we'll see in a bit
it<00:00:58.530> does<00:00:58.710> move<00:00:58.980> a<00:00:59.129> bit<00:00:59.309> every<00:00:59.850> minute<00:01:00.090> just

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
it does move a bit every minute just

them<00:01:38.820> we<00:01:39.329> are<00:01:39.479> looking<00:01:39.810> to<00:01:40.020> innovate<00:01:40.680> on<00:01:40.710> the

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
them we are looking to innovate on the

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.490 
them we are looking to innovate on the
idea<00:01:41.549> so<00:01:41.729> we<00:01:41.820> could<00:01:41.939> have<00:01:42.030> 60<00:01:42.329> seconds<00:01:42.869> you

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
idea so we could have 60 seconds you

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.100 
idea so we could have 60 seconds you
know<00:01:43.619> 60<00:01:44.040> minutes<00:01:44.340> and<00:01:44.700> 12<00:01:45.180> hours<00:01:45.390> see<00:01:45.689> three

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
know 60 minutes and 12 hours see three

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.139 
know 60 minutes and 12 hours see three
spirals<00:01:46.500> in<00:01:46.619> one<00:01:46.770> is<00:01:47.159> it<00:01:47.280> completely<00:01:47.759> accurate

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
spirals in one is it completely accurate

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:49.639 
spirals in one is it completely accurate
if<00:01:48.240> you<00:01:48.299> didn't<00:01:48.540> touch<00:01:48.659> it<00:01:48.930> for<00:01:49.170> months<00:01:49.409> on<00:01:49.590> end

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:54.499 
if you didn't touch it for months on end
would<00:01:50.159> it<00:01:50.250> still<00:01:50.490> tell<00:01:50.909> the<00:01:51.030> right<00:01:51.210> time<00:01:53.509> yeah

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
would it still tell the right time yeah

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.840 
would it still tell the right time yeah
it's<00:01:54.869> not<00:01:55.020> crystal<00:01:55.770> or<00:01:55.860> several<00:01:56.189> thousands<00:01:56.729> of

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:05.770 
does it take long to get used to because
it's<00:02:03.770> so<00:02:03.950> different<00:02:04.250> from<00:02:04.580> what<00:02:04.760> we<00:02:04.850> think<00:02:05.000> how

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:05.780 
it's so different from what we think how

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:07.360 
it's so different from what we think how
I<00:02:05.810> say<00:02:06.140> is<00:02:06.290> when<00:02:06.470> children<00:02:06.770> learn<00:02:07.040> to<00:02:07.100> tell<00:02:07.310> the

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:07.370 
I say is when children learn to tell the

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:08.950 
I say is when children learn to tell the
time<00:02:07.610> on<00:02:07.790> analog<00:02:08.119> clocks<00:02:08.330> it<00:02:08.450> does<00:02:08.750> take<00:02:08.930> a

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:08.960 
time on analog clocks it does take a

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:11.260 
time on analog clocks it does take a
while<00:02:09.560> to<00:02:09.590> learn<00:02:10.009> you<00:02:10.700> look<00:02:10.850> at<00:02:10.970> it<00:02:11.060> this<00:02:11.120> I

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:11.270 
while to learn you look at it this I

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:12.640 
while to learn you look at it this I
actually<00:02:11.420> think<00:02:11.630> it's<00:02:11.810> intuitive<00:02:12.290> you<00:02:12.500> look

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
actually think it's intuitive you look

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:14.260 
actually think it's intuitive you look
where<00:02:13.130> the<00:02:13.220> ball<00:02:13.400> is<00:02:13.430> you<00:02:13.880> look<00:02:14.030> to<00:02:14.060> the<00:02:14.240> left

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:14.270 
where the ball is you look to the left

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:15.490 
where the ball is you look to the left
you<00:02:14.600> look<00:02:14.720> to<00:02:14.810> the<00:02:14.900> right<00:02:14.930> on<00:02:15.140> the<00:02:15.260> spiral

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
you look to the right on the spiral

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.290 
you look to the right on the spiral
where<00:02:16.070> it<00:02:16.190> is<00:02:16.280> the<00:02:16.460> position<00:02:16.580> it<00:02:16.880> is<00:02:17.030> at<00:02:17.210> the

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
where it is the position it is at the

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.120 
where it is the position it is at the
time<00:02:17.450> it<00:02:17.600> is<00:02:17.750> and<00:02:18.050> it<00:02:18.140> all<00:02:18.290> started<00:02:18.860> with<00:02:19.070> a

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
time it is and it all started with a

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:21.070 
time it is and it all started with a
doodle<00:02:19.400> on<00:02:19.520> a<00:02:19.550> piece<00:02:19.730> of<00:02:19.760> paper<00:02:20.030> well<00:02:20.300> yeah<00:02:21.050> I

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
doodle on a piece of paper well yeah I

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.920 
doodle on a piece of paper well yeah I
was<00:02:21.550> well<00:02:22.550> as<00:02:22.700> I<00:02:22.730> think<00:02:23.120> of<00:02:23.360> things<00:02:23.450> trying<00:02:23.810> get

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
was well as I think of things trying get

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:25.750 
was well as I think of things trying get
to<00:02:24.020> sleep<00:02:24.200> and<00:02:24.470> I<00:02:24.830> was<00:02:24.890> thinking<00:02:25.010> this<00:02:25.280> giant

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
to sleep and I was thinking this giant

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.280 
to sleep and I was thinking this giant
space<00:02:26.060> station<00:02:26.510> that<00:02:26.660> was<00:02:26.780> shaped<00:02:27.080> like<00:02:27.170> a

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
space station that was shaped like a

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:33.820 
space station that was shaped like a
spiral<00:02:29.770> crazy<00:02:30.770> one<00:02:31.010> time<00:02:31.730> I<00:02:31.940> loved<00:02:32.180> it<00:02:32.330> and<00:02:32.990> and

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:33.830 
spiral crazy one time I loved it and and

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:35.230 
spiral crazy one time I loved it and and
gradually<00:02:34.400> that<00:02:34.430> sort<00:02:34.670> of<00:02:34.700> spiral<00:02:35.120> got

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:35.240 
gradually that sort of spiral got

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:36.370 
gradually that sort of spiral got
smaller<00:02:35.510> and<00:02:35.600> smaller<00:02:35.810> until<00:02:35.900> I<00:02:36.110> thought<00:02:36.290> of

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:36.380 
smaller and smaller until I thought of

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:37.960 
smaller and smaller until I thought of
one<00:02:36.530> side<00:02:36.830> to<00:02:36.950> the<00:02:36.980> London<00:02:37.310> Eye<00:02:37.400> and<00:02:37.430> then<00:02:37.850> it

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:37.970 
one side to the London Eye and then it

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:40.090 
one side to the London Eye and then it
got<00:02:38.060> even<00:02:38.240> smaller<00:02:38.510> and<00:02:38.870> I<00:02:38.900> thought<00:02:39.050> hang<00:02:39.590> on<00:02:39.680> a

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:40.100 
got even smaller and I thought hang on a

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:42.220 
got even smaller and I thought hang on a
ball<00:02:40.310> could<00:02:40.610> roll<00:02:40.790> on<00:02:40.940> this<00:02:41.090> spiral<00:02:41.300> and<00:02:41.630> could

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 
ball could roll on this spiral and could

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:44.949 
ball could roll on this spiral and could
it<00:02:42.320> tail<00:02:42.500> could<00:02:42.890> it<00:02:42.980> tell<00:02:43.130> the<00:02:43.250> time<00:02:43.780> it<00:02:44.780> is

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:44.959 
it tail could it tell the time it is

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:46.690 
it tail could it tell the time it is
beautiful<00:02:45.230> isn't<00:02:45.590> it<00:02:45.709> folks<00:02:45.920> it's<00:02:46.160> lovely<00:02:46.370> and

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
beautiful isn't it folks it's lovely and

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:47.890 
beautiful isn't it folks it's lovely and
it<00:02:46.850> really<00:02:47.000> took<00:02:47.150> off<00:02:47.270> when<00:02:47.330> you<00:02:47.540> met<00:02:47.720> Neil

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
it really took off when you met Neil

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.710 
it really took off when you met Neil
Neil<00:02:48.830> was<00:02:49.100> everything<00:02:49.730> you<00:02:50.030> know<00:02:50.420> we've<00:02:50.600> got<00:02:50.690> a

Neil was everything you know we've got a

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.480 
Neil was everything you know we've got a

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:54.770 
and he's a very very skilled engineer

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:56.470 
and he's a very very skilled engineer
and<00:02:55.250> he's<00:02:55.520> done<00:02:55.670> lots<00:02:55.700> of<00:02:55.940> gadgets

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
and he's done lots of gadgets

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.630 
and he's done lots of gadgets
I<00:02:56.570> was<00:02:56.720> not<00:02:56.900> it's<00:02:57.050> not<00:02:57.200> cheap<00:02:57.470> it's<00:02:57.650> 350<00:02:58.280> pounds

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 
I was not it's not cheap it's 350 pounds

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.070 
I was not it's not cheap it's 350 pounds
is<00:02:58.730> that<00:02:58.880> right<00:02:59.030> who<00:02:59.240> might<00:02:59.660> this<00:02:59.840> clock

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.080 
is that right who might this clock

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:02.440 
is that right who might this clock
appeal<00:03:00.380> to<00:03:00.590> well<00:03:00.890> it's<00:03:01.640> not<00:03:01.850> cheap<00:03:02.060> but<00:03:02.180> it<00:03:02.330> is

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450 
appeal to well it's not cheap but it is

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:05.199 
appeal to well it's not cheap but it is
an<00:03:02.720> original<00:03:02.959> there's<00:03:03.350> any<00:03:03.530> we<00:03:04.400> made<00:03:04.880> ten<00:03:05.090> of

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:05.209 
an original there's any we made ten of

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:08.110 
an original there's any we made ten of
them<00:03:05.330> so<00:03:05.540> far<00:03:05.920> we<00:03:06.920> aim<00:03:07.040> to<00:03:07.070> make<00:03:07.250> lots<00:03:07.790> of<00:03:07.970> them

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120 
them so far we aim to make lots of them

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.000 
them so far we aim to make lots of them
but<00:03:08.390> they're<00:03:08.600> made<00:03:09.019> by<00:03:09.200> the<00:03:09.260> inventor<00:03:09.739> so<00:03:09.980> I

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
but they're made by the inventor so I

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:11.410 
but they're made by the inventor so I
think<00:03:10.130> that<00:03:10.310> valuation<00:03:10.670> you<00:03:11.060> want<00:03:11.209> to<00:03:11.300> make

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.420 
think that valuation you want to make

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:13.180 
think that valuation you want to make
one<00:03:11.570> for<00:03:11.690> the<00:03:11.750> Olympics<00:03:12.110> in<00:03:12.170> 2012<00:03:12.769> that's<00:03:13.010> our

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190 
one for the Olympics in 2012 that's our

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:14.710 
one for the Olympics in 2012 that's our
ambition<00:03:13.610> the<00:03:13.730> giant<00:03:14.030> one<00:03:14.120> for<00:03:14.300> the<00:03:14.360> Olympics

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 
ambition the giant one for the Olympics

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:17.949 
ambition the giant one for the Olympics
possibly<00:03:15.320> a<00:03:15.350> countdown<00:03:15.650> clock<00:03:16.780> you<00:03:17.780> could

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:17.959 
possibly a countdown clock you could

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:20.020 
possibly a countdown clock you could
have<00:03:18.140> you<00:03:18.260> could<00:03:18.380> have<00:03:18.440> like<00:03:18.680> but<00:03:19.370> maybe<00:03:19.550> three

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030 
have you could have like but maybe three

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:22.990 
have you could have like but maybe three
couldn't<00:03:20.420> you<00:03:20.480> on<00:03:20.600> the<00:03:20.690> wall<00:03:20.870> you<00:03:21.320> know<00:03:22.000> what

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.000 
couldn't you on the wall you know what

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.460 
couldn't you on the wall you know what
is<00:03:23.120> the<00:03:23.209> second<00:03:23.600> clock<00:03:23.840> and<00:03:24.080> one<00:03:24.290> could<00:03:24.410> be

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:24.470 
is the second clock and one could be

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:25.570 
is the second clock and one could be
different<00:03:24.500> maybe<00:03:24.920> we<00:03:25.010> get<00:03:25.130> a<00:03:25.160> difference<00:03:25.459> be

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:25.580 
different maybe we get a difference be

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:27.250 
different maybe we get a difference be
to<00:03:25.700> the<00:03:25.790> hour<00:03:25.910> and<00:03:26.150> maybe<00:03:26.269> the<00:03:26.480> day<00:03:26.660> do<00:03:27.170> you

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.260 
to the hour and maybe the day do you

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.130 
to the hour and maybe the day do you
want<00:03:27.410> some<00:03:27.590> intellectual<00:03:28.100> property<00:03:28.400> no<00:03:29.140> we

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:30.140 
want some intellectual property no we

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:31.300 
want some intellectual property no we
definitely<00:03:30.260> gotta<00:03:30.620> take<00:03:30.769> a<00:03:30.800> photograph<00:03:31.040> of

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.310 
definitely gotta take a photograph of
