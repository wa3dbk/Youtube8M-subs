first one I'm just reviewing is this

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.150

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
cheap TPU case from ebay it's really not

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.259 
cheap TPU case from ebay it's really not
specific<00:00:20.609> names<00:00:20.820> just<00:00:21.180> called<00:00:21.660> S<00:00:22.430> shape<00:00:23.430> TPU

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
specific names just called S shape TPU

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:31.310 
specific names just called S shape TPU
case<00:00:26.300> the<00:00:27.300> cases<00:00:27.810> is<00:00:28.109> great<00:00:28.560> I<00:00:29.630> mean<00:00:30.630> I<00:00:30.660> do<00:00:30.810> like

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
case the cases is great I mean I do like

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.290 
case the cases is great I mean I do like
the<00:00:31.349> fact<00:00:31.619> that<00:00:31.920> it<00:00:32.099> has<00:00:32.219> it's<00:00:32.520> nice<00:00:32.730> s<00:00:33.000> shade

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
the fact that it has it's nice s shade

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.450 
the fact that it has it's nice s shade
so<00:00:33.600> it<00:00:33.690> kind<00:00:33.899> of<00:00:33.960> reminds<00:00:34.350> me<00:00:34.410> of<00:00:34.500> old<00:00:34.680> galaxy<00:00:35.280> s

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
so it kind of reminds me of old galaxy s

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.340 
so it kind of reminds me of old galaxy s
and<00:00:36.680> the<00:00:37.680> case<00:00:38.030> does<00:00:39.030> have<00:00:39.270> these<00:00:39.450> nice<00:00:39.660> rubber

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
and the case does have these nice rubber

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.080 
and the case does have these nice rubber
grooves<00:00:40.890> so<00:00:41.129> it's<00:00:41.280> easier<00:00:41.579> for<00:00:41.610> you<00:00:41.730> to<00:00:41.760> grab

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090
