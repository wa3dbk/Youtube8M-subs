00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
furnace mod as you can see in front of

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.780 
furnace mod as you can see in front of
me<00:00:34.320> it<00:00:34.500> just<00:00:34.530> adds<00:00:34.860> more<00:00:35.010> first<00:00:35.309> to<00:00:35.520> the<00:00:35.550> game

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:24.569 
that with two things at once we're going

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:26.179 
that with two things at once we're going
to<00:02:24.629> drop<00:02:24.810> it<00:02:25.170> in<00:02:25.349> there<00:02:25.439> and<00:02:25.680> you<00:02:25.829> stand<00:02:26.069> there

00:02:26.179 --> 00:02:26.189 
to drop it in there and you stand there

00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:28.759 
to drop it in there and you stand there
and<00:02:26.459> they'll<00:02:27.000> both<00:02:27.269> go<00:02:27.689> at<00:02:28.049> the<00:02:28.260> same<00:02:28.439> speed

and<00:02:28.950> both<00:02:29.310> stack<00:02:29.610> up<00:02:29.849> so<00:02:30.450> it's<00:02:30.569> incredibly

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
and both stack up so it's incredibly

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.149
