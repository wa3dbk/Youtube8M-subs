00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:35.120 
friends I'm about 32 or 3 weeks ago and

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:40.040 
friends I'm about 32 or 3 weeks ago and
it's<00:00:36.120> this<00:00:36.510> printed<00:00:37.260> oversized<00:00:38.300> blazer<00:00:39.300> with

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
it's this printed oversized blazer with

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.139 
it's this printed oversized blazer with
sort<00:00:40.739> of<00:00:40.860> this<00:00:41.280> Aztec<00:00:42.059> print<00:00:42.660> and<00:00:43.460> I<00:00:44.460> really

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
sort of this Aztec print and I really

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:46.910 
sort of this Aztec print and I really
liked<00:00:45.329> it<00:00:45.360> and<00:00:45.690> I<00:00:45.809> figured<00:00:46.140> that<00:00:46.260> I<00:00:46.289> could<00:00:46.379> also

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
liked it and I figured that I could also

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.779 
liked it and I figured that I could also
use<00:00:47.579> this<00:00:47.820> as<00:00:48.090> a<00:00:48.450> spring<00:00:49.350> jacket<00:00:49.620> since<00:00:50.309> it<00:00:50.610> is

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
use this as a spring jacket since it is

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.380 
use this as a spring jacket since it is
oversized<00:00:51.449> I<00:00:51.930> also<00:00:52.260> like<00:00:52.620> how<00:00:53.550> there's

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
oversized I also like how there's

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.680 
oversized I also like how there's
pockets<00:00:54.660> on<00:00:55.230> both<00:00:55.829> sides<00:00:55.980> because<00:00:56.820> I<00:00:57.360> hate

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
pockets on both sides because I hate

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.680 
pockets on both sides because I hate
having<00:00:57.930> a<00:00:58.109> jacket<00:00:58.469> without<00:00:58.590> pockets<00:00:59.690> it's

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
having a jacket without pockets it's

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.119 
having a jacket without pockets it's
just<00:01:01.050> so<00:01:01.199> much<00:01:01.320> more<00:01:01.379> convenient<00:01:01.800> when<00:01:01.980> there

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
just so much more convenient when there

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.450 
just so much more convenient when there
is<00:01:02.280> so<00:01:02.579> I<00:01:02.609> was<00:01:02.879> happy<00:01:03.149> about<00:01:03.180> that<00:01:03.359> I<00:01:03.799> think<00:01:04.799> if

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
is so I was happy about that I think if

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.179

to try them on yet
without<00:01:42.540> washing<00:01:42.810> them<00:01:43.200> you<00:01:43.409> could<00:01:43.560> just<00:01:43.740> feel

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
without washing them you could just feel

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:48.590

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:01.480 
the color of like Tostitos how do you
think<00:03:59.750> I'm<00:03:59.870> hungry<00:04:00.200> yeah<00:04:00.770> and<00:04:00.980> it<00:04:01.130> has<00:04:01.280> like

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:01.490 
think I'm hungry yeah and it has like

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:06.540 
think I'm hungry yeah and it has like
these<00:04:01.760> speckled<00:04:02.510> green<00:04:03.410> red<00:04:04.390> parts<00:04:05.390> in<00:04:05.540> it<00:04:05.660> too

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:06.550 
these speckled green red parts in it too

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:10.990 
these speckled green red parts in it too
and<00:04:07.900> I<00:04:08.900> always<00:04:09.140> liked<00:04:09.470> finding<00:04:09.709> longer<00:04:10.700> knits

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:11.000 
and I always liked finding longer knits

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.810 
and I always liked finding longer knits
because<00:04:11.690> then<00:04:12.260> I<00:04:12.410> could<00:04:12.920> wear<00:04:13.100> them<00:04:13.280> with

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:13.820 
because then I could wear them with

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:15.460 
because then I could wear them with
tights<00:04:14.150> and<00:04:14.450> those<00:04:14.630> still<00:04:14.840> covering<00:04:15.140> my<00:04:15.230> butt

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:15.470 
tights and those still covering my butt

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:18.000 
tights and those still covering my butt
so<00:04:15.920> I<00:04:15.950> find<00:04:16.370> that's<00:04:16.459> like<00:04:16.669> the<00:04:16.850> comfiest<00:04:17.299> compo

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:18.010 
so I find that's like the comfiest compo

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:20.349 
so I find that's like the comfiest compo
combination<00:04:19.010> to<00:04:19.310> wear<00:04:19.489> when<00:04:19.730> I<00:04:19.820> go<00:04:19.940> to<00:04:20.000> school

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:20.359 
combination to wear when I go to school

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:22.480
