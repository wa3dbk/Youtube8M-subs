get every day of my life is like when
the<00:00:30.510> fuck<00:00:30.779> is<00:00:30.900> parallel<00:00:31.289> going<00:00:31.470> to<00:00:31.529> be<00:00:31.619> out<00:00:31.710> and

00:00:32.799 --> 00:00:32.809 
the fuck is parallel going to be out and

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:37.520 
the fuck is parallel going to be out and
you<00:00:33.809> know<00:00:35.600> anyways<00:00:36.600> um<00:00:36.840> yesterday<00:00:37.320> was<00:00:37.500> the

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
first time we got a set date for

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.400 
first time we got a set date for
parallel<00:00:40.309> to<00:00:41.309> be<00:00:41.430> released<00:00:41.760> I<00:00:42.030> was<00:00:42.989> talking<00:00:43.379> to

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
parallel to be released I was talking to

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.880 
parallel to be released I was talking to
jeremy<00:00:44.450> you<00:00:45.450> guys<00:00:45.600> known<00:00:45.809> as<00:00:45.960> know<00:00:46.469> him<00:00:46.710> as

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
phage make the one who's that it in

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.810 
phage make the one who's that it in
parallel<00:00:48.690> and<00:00:48.899> if<00:00:49.860> you<00:00:49.950> guys<00:00:50.100> don't<00:00:50.430> know<00:00:50.670> what

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
parallel and if you guys don't know what

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.119 
parallel and if you guys don't know what
parallel<00:00:51.210> is<00:00:51.360> by<00:00:51.690> any<00:00:51.840> chance<00:00:51.870> it's<00:00:52.469> dual

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
parallel is by any chance it's dual

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.740 
parallel is by any chance it's dual
tires<00:00:53.340> that<00:00:53.699> mean<00:00:53.969> face<00:00:54.780> fake<00:00:55.020> you're<00:00:55.260> doing

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:56.750 
tires that mean face fake you're doing

mar<00:00:57.750> 04<00:00:57.930> to<00:00:58.050> do<00:00:58.260> Asajj<00:00:58.910> anyways<00:01:00.680> parallel<00:01:01.680> is

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
mar 04 to do Asajj anyways parallel is

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.690 
mar 04 to do Asajj anyways parallel is
to<00:01:02.160> be<00:01:02.280> out<00:01:02.460> within<00:01:02.699> two<00:01:03.030> weeks<00:01:04.339> that's<00:01:05.339> all<00:01:05.670> I

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
how like the concept of it and it looks

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.789 
how like the concept of it and it looks
really<00:01:36.240> really<00:01:36.840> sick<00:01:37.049> I've<00:01:37.229> never<00:01:37.409> seen<00:01:37.650> it

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
really really sick I've never seen it

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:42.440 
really really sick I've never seen it
before<00:01:37.890> on<00:01:38.130> any<00:01:38.759> any<00:01:39.210> montages<00:01:39.840> so<00:01:41.390> without<00:01:42.390> a

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
before on any any montages so without a

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:43.969 
before on any any montages so without a
doubt<00:01:42.689> parallel<00:01:43.079> is<00:01:43.259> definitely<00:01:43.619> gonna<00:01:43.710> look

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
doubt parallel is definitely gonna look

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:49.399 
doubt parallel is definitely gonna look
sick<00:01:44.250> and<00:01:47.030> other<00:01:48.030> reason<00:01:48.390> was<00:01:48.509> it<00:01:48.810> been<00:01:49.049> taking

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
sick and other reason was it been taking

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.190 
sick and other reason was it been taking
long<00:01:49.590> there<00:01:50.460> was<00:01:50.610> one<00:01:50.790> part<00:01:51.180> where<00:01:51.720> Jeremy

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
long there was one part where Jeremy

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.710 
long there was one part where Jeremy
Jeremy<00:01:52.710> his<00:01:52.950> computer<00:01:53.399> broke<00:01:53.909> and<00:01:54.240> yet<00:01:54.479> to<00:01:54.600> get
