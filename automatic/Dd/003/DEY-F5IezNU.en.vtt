rare biome is quite close

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.060 
rare biome is quite close
so<00:00:44.730> within<00:00:45.450> 2000<00:00:45.930> blocks<00:00:46.140> you<00:00:46.320> can<00:00:46.350> find<00:00:46.800> for

so within 2000 blocks you can find for

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.950 
so within 2000 blocks you can find for

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
the mega taiga and also in the corner

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.610 
the mega taiga and also in the corner
down<00:00:53.129> here<00:00:53.190> you<00:00:53.430> can<00:00:53.640> barely<00:00:53.820> see<00:00:54.090> it<00:00:54.120> but

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:54.620 
down here you can barely see it but

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:59.889 
down here you can barely see it but
there<00:00:55.620> we<00:00:55.770> have<00:00:56.010> some<00:00:56.430> ice<00:00:56.879> by<00:00:57.420> explains<00:00:58.199> and

00:00:59.889 --> 00:00:59.899 
there we have some ice by explains and

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:03.170 
there we have some ice by explains and
yeah<00:01:00.899> so<00:01:01.199> you<00:01:01.260> have<00:01:01.500> all<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:01.980> rare<00:01:02.820> biomes

yeah so you have all the rare biomes
within<00:01:03.539> 2000<00:01:04.409> blocks<00:01:04.739> and<00:01:04.979> you<00:01:05.339> can<00:01:05.489> see<00:01:05.670> all

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
within 2000 blocks and you can see all

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.850 
within 2000 blocks and you can see all
the<00:01:06.090> stuff<00:01:06.360> that<00:01:06.390> you<00:01:06.689> can<00:01:06.900> find<00:01:07.170> on<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:07.500> right

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
the stuff that you can find on the right

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.130 
the stuff that you can find on the right
side<00:01:08.130> of<00:01:08.369> the<00:01:08.520> screen<00:01:08.700> as<00:01:08.970> always<00:01:09.330> but<00:01:09.780> the

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
side of the screen as always but the

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.200 
side of the screen as always but the
more<00:01:10.320> important<00:01:10.740> part<00:01:10.979> for<00:01:11.250> us<00:01:11.430> I<00:01:11.700> guess<00:01:11.939> now

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
more important part for us I guess now

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.760 
more important part for us I guess now
that<00:01:12.240> you<00:01:12.570> have<00:01:12.689> seen<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:13.110> map<00:01:13.260> of<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:13.560> sea

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
that you have seen the map of the sea

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.160 
that you have seen the map of the sea
how<00:01:14.130> does<00:01:14.310> it<00:01:14.430> look<00:01:14.610> in<00:01:14.790> the<00:01:14.970> actual<00:01:15.390> game<00:01:15.600> so

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
how does it look in the actual game so

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.560 
how does it look in the actual game so
let's<00:01:16.590> go<00:01:16.890> back<00:01:16.920> to<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:17.580> game<00:01:17.790> and<00:01:17.909> let<00:01:18.270> me<00:01:18.360> put

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
let's go back to the game and let me put

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.170 
let's go back to the game and let me put
the<00:01:18.689> map<00:01:18.900> on<00:01:19.110> the<00:01:19.170> screen<00:01:19.710> for<00:01:19.890> you<00:01:20.040> so<00:01:20.220> spawn

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
the map on the screen for you so spawn

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.359 
the map on the screen for you so spawn
as<00:01:21.390> a<00:01:21.450> set<00:01:21.780> is<00:01:21.990> in<00:01:22.229> a<00:01:22.640> YA<00:01:23.640> jungle<00:01:24.180> biome<00:01:24.689> and

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:25.369 
as a set is in a YA jungle biome and

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:28.460 
as a set is in a YA jungle biome and
this<00:01:26.369> is<00:01:26.580> actually<00:01:27.150> a<00:01:27.180> jungle<00:01:27.540> edge<00:01:27.689> so<00:01:28.229> there

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
this is actually a jungle edge so there

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.530 
this is actually a jungle edge so there
are<00:01:28.530> no<00:01:28.710> pushers<00:01:29.189> on<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:29.460> floor<00:01:29.729> so<00:01:30.270> it's<00:01:30.420> an

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
are no pushers on the floor so it's an

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.010 
are no pushers on the floor so it's an
awesome<00:01:30.869> spawn<00:01:31.619> and<00:01:31.920> then<00:01:32.159> you<00:01:32.310> have<00:01:32.400> the<00:01:32.549> Mesa

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
awesome spawn and then you have the Mesa

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.300 
awesome spawn and then you have the Mesa
right<00:01:34.020> next<00:01:34.290> to<00:01:34.380> it<00:01:34.470> and<00:01:34.619> you<00:01:34.710> can<00:01:34.860> also<00:01:35.040> see

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
right next to it and you can also see

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.640 
right next to it and you can also see
the<00:01:35.430> tiger<00:01:35.820> and<00:01:36.030> I<00:01:36.600> think<00:01:37.110> that<00:01:37.259> I<00:01:37.350> don't<00:01:37.530> have

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
the tiger and I think that I don't have

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.530 
the tiger and I think that I don't have
to<00:01:37.860> go<00:01:38.040> into<00:01:38.220> too<00:01:38.430> much<00:01:38.460> detail<00:01:38.970> about<00:01:39.030> the

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
to go into too much detail about the

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.749 
to go into too much detail about the
spawn<00:01:39.869> but<00:01:40.049> let's<00:01:40.259> just<00:01:40.560> fly<00:01:41.340> a<00:01:41.369> little<00:01:41.579> bit

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
spawn but let's just fly a little bit

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.240 
spawn but let's just fly a little bit
into<00:01:42.509> this<00:01:42.659> direction<00:01:42.869> because<00:01:43.320> we<00:01:43.770> will<00:01:43.920> come

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
into this direction because we will come

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.120 
into this direction because we will come
to<00:01:44.460> a<00:01:44.490> point<00:01:44.970> over<00:01:45.329> here<00:01:45.360> where<00:01:46.140> you<00:01:46.799> can<00:01:46.950> see

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
to a point over here where you can see

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.249 
to a point over here where you can see
on<00:01:47.220> the<00:01:47.340> map<00:01:47.490> at<00:01:47.700> zerozero<00:01:48.030> everything<00:01:48.930> fits

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
on the map at zerozero everything fits

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.190 
on the map at zerozero everything fits
together<00:01:49.530> so<00:01:50.009> the<00:01:50.250> two<00:01:50.490> Mesa<00:01:51.180> biomes<00:01:51.659> and<00:01:51.899> the

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
together so the two Mesa biomes and the

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.859 
together so the two Mesa biomes and the
jungle<00:01:52.560> and<00:01:52.740> a<00:01:52.979> desert<00:01:53.250> so<00:01:54.180> this<00:01:54.420> is<00:01:54.570> quite

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
jungle and a desert so this is quite

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.219 
jungle and a desert so this is quite
cool<00:01:55.259> and<00:01:55.909> yeah<00:01:56.909> it<00:01:57.030> makes<00:01:57.210> a<00:01:57.420> awesome<00:01:57.899> spawn

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
cool and yeah it makes a awesome spawn

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.819 
cool and yeah it makes a awesome spawn
for<00:01:58.680> a<00:01:59.659> map<00:02:00.659> that<00:02:00.840> you<00:02:00.990> would<00:02:01.170> like<00:02:01.380> to<00:02:01.560> play

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
for a map that you would like to play

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.639 
for a map that you would like to play
and<00:02:02.420> in<00:02:03.420> the<00:02:03.540> last<00:02:03.659> video<00:02:03.869> I<00:02:04.020> asked<00:02:04.439> if<00:02:04.530> you

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
and in the last video I asked if you

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.830 
and in the last video I asked if you
want<00:02:04.829> me<00:02:05.070> to<00:02:05.310> fly<00:02:05.670> around<00:02:05.820> or<00:02:06.210> teleport<00:02:06.780> around

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
want me to fly around or teleport around

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.199 
want me to fly around or teleport around
and<00:02:07.340> everybody<00:02:08.340> that<00:02:08.520> was<00:02:08.700> answering<00:02:09.090> was

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
and everybody that was answering was

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:10.930 
and everybody that was answering was
saying<00:02:09.479> I<00:02:09.660> should<00:02:09.869> fly<00:02:10.050> around<00:02:10.259> so<00:02:10.679> let

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
saying I should fly around so let

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.330 
saying I should fly around so let
quickly<00:02:11.300> do<00:02:11.450> this<00:02:11.600> so<00:02:12.110> here<00:02:12.380> we<00:02:12.500> have<00:02:12.710> some

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
quickly do this so here we have some

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.970 
quickly do this so here we have some
extreme<00:02:13.760> health<00:02:14.000> and<00:02:14.270> I<00:02:15.110> think<00:02:15.230> we<00:02:15.530> can<00:02:15.740> just

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
extreme health and I think we can just

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.550 
extreme health and I think we can just
follow<00:02:16.280> the<00:02:16.610> border<00:02:17.060> of<00:02:17.210> the<00:02:17.360> Mesa<00:02:17.600> here<00:02:18.020> going

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
follow the border of the Mesa here going

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.670 
follow the border of the Mesa here going
south<00:02:18.950> so<00:02:19.670> we'll<00:02:19.940> come<00:02:20.270> to<00:02:20.510> a<00:02:20.540> bit<00:02:20.990> of<00:02:21.020> Plains

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
south so we'll come to a bit of Plains

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.210 
south so we'll come to a bit of Plains
here<00:02:22.160> and<00:02:22.340> now<00:02:23.090> we<00:02:23.150> are<00:02:23.390> reaching<00:02:24.020> the<00:02:24.470> 1,000

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
here and now we are reaching the 1,000

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.690 
here and now we are reaching the 1,000
block<00:02:25.400> line<00:02:25.880> so<00:02:26.600> yeah<00:02:27.560> but<00:02:27.920> of<00:02:28.040> planes<00:02:28.310> but<00:02:28.610> of

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
block line so yeah but of planes but of

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.510 
block line so yeah but of planes but of
forest<00:02:29.150> and<00:02:29.300> if<00:02:30.080> we<00:02:30.260> go<00:02:30.410> further<00:02:30.830> to<00:02:31.340> this

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:31.520 
forest and if we go further to this

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:32.740 
forest and if we go further to this
house

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
house

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:36.340 
house
we<00:02:33.110> will<00:02:33.290> yeah<00:02:33.890> come<00:02:34.220> to<00:02:34.490> a<00:02:35.030> code<00:02:35.720> prime<00:02:35.990> area

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:36.350 
we will yeah come to a code prime area

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:39.370 
we will yeah come to a code prime area
so<00:02:36.560> let's<00:02:36.830> just<00:02:37.550> fly<00:02:37.790> a<00:02:37.820> bit<00:02:38.060> to<00:02:38.630> the<00:02:38.780> left<00:02:39.020> here

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.380 
so let's just fly a bit to the left here

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:41.470 
so let's just fly a bit to the left here
so<00:02:40.010> here<00:02:40.250> you<00:02:40.310> can<00:02:40.460> see<00:02:40.700> that<00:02:40.910> we've<00:02:41.060> got<00:02:41.270> the

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
so here you can see that we've got the

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.050 
so here you can see that we've got the
code<00:02:41.720> areas<00:02:42.260> over<00:02:42.680> here<00:02:43.070> and<00:02:43.250> they<00:02:44.000> are

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
code areas over here and they are

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.450 
code areas over here and they are
actually<00:02:44.270> attached<00:02:45.200> on<00:02:45.410> the<00:02:45.560> Mesa<00:02:45.800> somewhere

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:46.460 
actually attached on the Mesa somewhere

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:48.820 
actually attached on the Mesa somewhere
around<00:02:46.550> here<00:02:47.000> of<00:02:47.120> the<00:02:47.240> transload<00:02:47.750> in<00:02:47.960> properly

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:48.830 
around here of the transload in properly

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:51.370 
around here of the transload in properly
I<00:02:49.220> can<00:02:49.490> see<00:02:49.970> that<00:02:50.090> my<00:02:50.270> CPU<00:02:50.720> is<00:02:50.750> running<00:02:51.080> on<00:02:51.170> 100%

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:51.380 
I can see that my CPU is running on 100%

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:54.160 
I can see that my CPU is running on 100%
also<00:02:52.310> this<00:02:53.210> is<00:02:53.360> quite<00:02:53.570> intense<00:02:53.900> for<00:02:54.050> my

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170 
also this is quite intense for my

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:57.280 
also this is quite intense for my
computer<00:02:54.560> to<00:02:54.740> run<00:02:55.280> this<00:02:55.520> server<00:02:56.360> and<00:02:56.690> also<00:02:56.840> fly

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
computer to run this server and also fly

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:58.510 
computer to run this server and also fly
around<00:02:57.350> in<00:02:57.680> it<00:02:57.830> that<00:02:58.070> fast

00:02:58.510 --> 00:02:58.520 
around in it that fast

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:00.160 
around in it that fast
maybe<00:02:58.880> we<00:02:59.000> should<00:02:59.180> reload<00:02:59.480> the<00:02:59.660> trunk<00:02:59.930> so<00:03:00.080> we

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170 
maybe we should reload the trunk so we

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:02.290 
maybe we should reload the trunk so we
don't<00:03:00.350> get<00:03:00.410> any<00:03:00.620> problems<00:03:01.010> here<00:03:01.220> and<00:03:01.460> yeah

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:02.300 
don't get any problems here and yeah

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.090 
don't get any problems here and yeah
here<00:03:02.660> you<00:03:02.750> can<00:03:02.930> see<00:03:03.170> that<00:03:03.380> the<00:03:03.650> Mesa<00:03:03.830> is

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:04.100 
here you can see that the Mesa is

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:07.240 
here you can see that the Mesa is
touching<00:03:04.580> the<00:03:04.850> ice<00:03:05.210> biomes<00:03:05.810> and<00:03:06.080> I<00:03:06.800> think<00:03:07.100> now

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
touching the ice biomes and I think now

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:10.180 
touching the ice biomes and I think now
we<00:03:07.310> can<00:03:07.700> just<00:03:07.940> fly<00:03:08.210> over<00:03:09.050> this<00:03:09.200> ocean<00:03:09.470> to<00:03:09.920> the

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:10.190 
we can just fly over this ocean to the

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:13.090 
we can just fly over this ocean to the
east<00:03:10.760> here<00:03:11.300> because<00:03:12.020> if<00:03:12.230> we<00:03:12.380> fly<00:03:12.650> from<00:03:12.860> this

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:13.100 
east here because if we fly from this

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:15.699 
east here because if we fly from this
point<00:03:13.490> east<00:03:13.790> you<00:03:14.510> will<00:03:14.690> find<00:03:15.020> an<00:03:15.260> ocean

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:15.709 
point east you will find an ocean

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:17.770 
point east you will find an ocean
monument<00:03:16.100> and<00:03:16.580> it<00:03:16.820> shouldn't<00:03:17.209> be<00:03:17.270> too<00:03:17.480> far

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:17.780 
monument and it shouldn't be too far

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:19.620 
monument and it shouldn't be too far
here<00:03:18.080> let<00:03:18.230> me<00:03:18.260> just<00:03:18.410> check<00:03:18.890> the<00:03:19.070> coordinates

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:19.630 
here let me just check the coordinates

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:23.860 
here let me just check the coordinates
yet<00:03:20.630> we'll<00:03:21.250> get<00:03:22.250> to<00:03:22.520> the<00:03:22.670> monument<00:03:23.090> right<00:03:23.450> here

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
yet we'll get to the monument right here

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:27.550 
yet we'll get to the monument right here
so<00:03:24.200> it's<00:03:24.440> not<00:03:24.590> too<00:03:24.860> far<00:03:25.220> and<00:03:25.959> now<00:03:26.959> if<00:03:27.170> we<00:03:27.320> take<00:03:27.500> a

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:27.560 
so it's not too far and now if we take a

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:30.340 
so it's not too far and now if we take a
look<00:03:27.770> on<00:03:27.950> the<00:03:28.160> map<00:03:28.340> again<00:03:28.489> we<00:03:29.180> are<00:03:29.480> somewhere

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:30.350 
look on the map again we are somewhere

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:34.510 
look on the map again we are somewhere
around<00:03:30.850> here<00:03:31.850> in<00:03:32.060> this<00:03:32.480> area<00:03:32.739> so<00:03:33.739> I<00:03:34.070> guess<00:03:34.340> the

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:34.520 
around here in this area so I guess the

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:36.640 
around here in this area so I guess the
best<00:03:34.670> thing<00:03:35.150> would<00:03:35.300> now<00:03:35.540> to<00:03:35.600> be<00:03:35.900> to<00:03:36.200> go<00:03:36.470> to<00:03:36.500> the

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:36.650 
best thing would now to be to go to the

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:39.430 
best thing would now to be to go to the
mushroom<00:03:37.130> island<00:03:37.310> so<00:03:38.120> let's<00:03:38.570> go<00:03:38.870> back<00:03:38.900> to<00:03:39.140> the

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:39.440 
mushroom island so let's go back to the

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:44.770 
mushroom island so let's go back to the
game<00:03:39.650> and<00:03:39.880> fly<00:03:40.880> yeah<00:03:41.750> to<00:03:42.110> the<00:03:43.510> what<00:03:44.510> is<00:03:44.630> it

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:44.780 
game and fly yeah to the what is it

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:45.660 
game and fly yeah to the what is it

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:49.180 
Norris
East<00:03:46.670> I<00:03:47.239> guess<00:03:47.570> we<00:03:47.810> need<00:03:47.930> to<00:03:48.110> go<00:03:48.260> so<00:03:48.800> this<00:03:49.010> way

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:49.190 
East I guess we need to go so this way

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:52.690 
East I guess we need to go so this way
and<00:03:50.620> then<00:03:51.620> we<00:03:51.739> should<00:03:51.950> reach<00:03:52.160> the<00:03:52.489> land

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:52.700 
and then we should reach the land

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:55.660 
and then we should reach the land
hopefully<00:03:53.630> quite<00:03:54.019> soon<00:03:54.500> and<00:03:54.709> then<00:03:55.400> we<00:03:55.519> already

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:55.670 
hopefully quite soon and then we already

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:57.160 
hopefully quite soon and then we already
have<00:03:55.970> a<00:03:56.000> little<00:03:56.209> bit<00:03:56.360> of<00:03:56.540> mushroom<00:03:56.780> island

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:57.170 
have a little bit of mushroom island

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:00.520 
have a little bit of mushroom island
here<00:03:57.680> so<00:03:57.920> it's<00:03:58.459> the<00:03:59.060> motion<00:03:59.180> monument<00:03:59.720> is<00:03:59.900> also

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:00.530 
here so it's the motion monument is also

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:02.560 
here so it's the motion monument is also
stood<00:04:00.950> and<00:04:01.130> view<00:04:01.370> range<00:04:01.610> from<00:04:01.940> the<00:04:02.150> mushroom

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:02.570 
stood and view range from the mushroom

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:04.870 
stood and view range from the mushroom
island<00:04:02.780> here<00:04:03.200> and<00:04:03.380> if<00:04:04.190> we<00:04:04.250> just<00:04:04.370> take<00:04:04.640> a<00:04:04.700> look

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:04.880 
island here and if we just take a look

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:08.560 
island here and if we just take a look
at<00:04:05.030> this<00:04:05.269> yeah<00:04:05.870> it's<00:04:06.050> connected<00:04:06.560> to<00:04:06.590> the<00:04:07.570> land

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:08.570 
at this yeah it's connected to the land

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:11.979 
at this yeah it's connected to the land
here<00:04:08.930> so<00:04:09.170> we<00:04:09.350> have<00:04:09.500> the<00:04:09.910> desert<00:04:10.910> over<00:04:11.390> here<00:04:11.780> and

00:04:11.979 --> 00:04:11.989 
here so we have the desert over here and

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:14.699 
here so we have the desert over here and
there<00:04:12.200> should<00:04:12.410> also<00:04:12.620> be<00:04:12.769> also<00:04:13.670> monuments

00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:14.709 
there should also be also monuments

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:17.770 
there should also be also monuments
right<00:04:15.709> here<00:04:16.070> yep<00:04:16.400> there<00:04:16.669> it<00:04:16.790> is

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:17.780 
right here yep there it is

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:20.020 
right here yep there it is
and<00:04:17.900> then<00:04:18.680> we<00:04:18.859> have<00:04:19.010> to<00:04:19.130> put<00:04:19.280> up<00:04:19.400> Savannah<00:04:19.790> and

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:20.030 
and then we have to put up Savannah and

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:21.819 
and then we have to put up Savannah and
this<00:04:20.209> is<00:04:20.359> touched<00:04:20.600> and<00:04:20.780> then<00:04:20.870> another<00:04:21.410> jungle

00:04:21.819 --> 00:04:21.829 
this is touched and then another jungle

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:24.490 
this is touched and then another jungle
biome<00:04:22.160> so<00:04:23.030> let's<00:04:23.389> take<00:04:23.630> a<00:04:23.660> look<00:04:23.900> at<00:04:24.139> the<00:04:24.290> depth

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:24.500 
biome so let's take a look at the depth

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:27.100 
biome so let's take a look at the depth
you<00:04:24.889> can<00:04:24.920> see<00:04:25.280> it<00:04:25.400> over<00:04:25.700> here<00:04:25.730> and<00:04:26.330> if<00:04:26.750> we<00:04:26.810> just

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:27.110 
you can see it over here and if we just

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:30.490 
you can see it over here and if we just
follow<00:04:27.410> the<00:04:27.889> side<00:04:28.850> of<00:04:29.030> the<00:04:29.210> jungle<00:04:29.480> we<00:04:30.080> can<00:04:30.260> see

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:30.500 
follow the side of the jungle we can see

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:32.110 
follow the side of the jungle we can see
all<00:04:30.740> kinds<00:04:30.770> of<00:04:31.220> different<00:04:31.280> biomes<00:04:31.850> because

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:32.120 
all kinds of different biomes because

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:35.290 
all kinds of different biomes because
here<00:04:32.510> we<00:04:32.660> have<00:04:32.750> quite<00:04:33.290> some<00:04:33.850> small<00:04:34.850> green

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:35.300 
here we have quite some small green

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:38.770 
here we have quite some small green
biomes<00:04:35.780> and<00:04:36.370> that<00:04:37.370> including<00:04:38.060> yeah<00:04:38.330> here<00:04:38.630> the

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:38.780 
biomes and that including yeah here the

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:41.980 
biomes and that including yeah here the
Savannah<00:04:39.110> stop<00:04:39.820> let's<00:04:40.820> reload<00:04:41.180> chunks<00:04:41.690> again

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:41.990 
Savannah stop let's reload chunks again

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:45.730 
Savannah stop let's reload chunks again
and<00:04:43.510> then<00:04:44.510> we<00:04:44.600> come<00:04:44.780> to<00:04:44.810> a<00:04:44.960> bit<00:04:45.080> of<00:04:45.200> a<00:04:45.290> forest

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:45.740 
and then we come to a bit of a forest

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:47.409 
and then we come to a bit of a forest
and<00:04:46.070> then<00:04:46.460> we<00:04:46.580> should<00:04:46.730> also<00:04:46.910> have<00:04:47.030> a<00:04:47.150> bit<00:04:47.300> of

00:04:47.409 --> 00:04:47.419 
and then we should also have a bit of

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:50.760 
and then we should also have a bit of
planes<00:04:47.930> up<00:04:48.530> here<00:04:48.950> a<00:04:48.980> bit<00:04:49.130> of<00:04:49.340> roof<00:04:49.639> forests<00:04:50.330> and

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:50.770 
planes up here a bit of roof forests and

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:53.230 
planes up here a bit of roof forests and
we're<00:04:51.770> still<00:04:52.010> next<00:04:52.280> to<00:04:52.370> the<00:04:52.490> dung<00:04:52.700> as<00:04:52.910> you<00:04:53.060> can

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:53.240 
we're still next to the dung as you can

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:57.700 
we're still next to the dung as you can
see<00:04:53.510> then<00:04:54.140> a<00:04:54.169> bit<00:04:54.350> of<00:04:54.440> tiger<00:04:55.160> here<00:04:55.610> and<00:04:56.710> then

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:57.710 
see then a bit of tiger here and then

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:00.159 
see then a bit of tiger here and then
this<00:04:58.040> should<00:04:58.370> wrap<00:04:58.610> around<00:04:58.940> to<00:04:59.180> a<00:04:59.210> swamp<00:04:59.990> area

00:05:00.159 --> 00:05:00.169 
this should wrap around to a swamp area

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:02.920 
this should wrap around to a swamp area
and<00:05:00.710> the<00:05:01.490> next<00:05:01.790> to<00:05:01.850> the<00:05:02.000> swamp<00:05:02.330> we'll<00:05:02.660> have<00:05:02.900> a

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:02.930 
and the next to the swamp we'll have a

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:03.940 
and the next to the swamp we'll have a
mega<00:05:03.260> tiger

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:03.950 
mega tiger

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:06.640 
mega tiger
so<00:05:04.310> all<00:05:04.490> kinds<00:05:04.820> of<00:05:04.880> biomes<00:05:05.300> quite<00:05:06.169> close<00:05:06.440> to

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:06.650 
so all kinds of biomes quite close to

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:10.060 
so all kinds of biomes quite close to
each<00:05:06.800> other<00:05:06.980> and<00:05:07.780> make<00:05:08.780> an<00:05:08.960> A<00:05:09.200> yeah<00:05:09.800> good

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:10.070 
each other and make an A yeah good

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:11.260 
each other and make an A yeah good
combination<00:05:10.820> here

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:11.270 
combination here

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:13.390 
combination here
I<00:05:11.300> guess<00:05:11.780> now<00:05:12.050> for<00:05:12.590> the<00:05:12.890> end<00:05:13.010> of<00:05:13.130> this<00:05:13.280> video

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:13.400 
I guess now for the end of this video

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:15.969 
I guess now for the end of this video
let's<00:05:13.850> just<00:05:14.140> lie<00:05:15.140> back<00:05:15.169> maybe<00:05:15.590> we<00:05:15.650> can<00:05:15.800> fly

00:05:15.969 --> 00:05:15.979 
let's just lie back maybe we can fly

00:05:15.979 --> 00:05:17.680 
let's just lie back maybe we can fly
backwards<00:05:16.190> so<00:05:16.639> the<00:05:16.820> chunk<00:05:17.090> loading<00:05:17.240> is<00:05:17.479> better

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:17.690 
backwards so the chunk loading is better

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:21.100 
backwards so the chunk loading is better
or<00:05:18.380> it<00:05:18.800> isn't<00:05:19.070> I<00:05:19.400> don't<00:05:19.430> know<00:05:19.840> it's<00:05:20.840> still

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:21.110 
or it isn't I don't know it's still

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:23.980 
or it isn't I don't know it's still
weird<00:05:21.260> in<00:05:21.470> 1.8<00:05:22.010> we<00:05:22.430> subtract<00:05:22.850> loading<00:05:23.210> some

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:23.990 
weird in 1.8 we subtract loading some

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:26.100 
weird in 1.8 we subtract loading some
times<00:05:24.169> the<00:05:24.350> load<00:05:24.530> sometimes<00:05:24.770> they<00:05:25.490> don't<00:05:25.729> but

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:26.110 
times the load sometimes they don't but

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:28.540 
times the load sometimes they don't but
anyways<00:05:27.110> I<00:05:27.290> hope<00:05:27.470> that<00:05:27.680> you<00:05:27.830> will<00:05:27.979> enjoy<00:05:28.130> the

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:28.550 
anyways I hope that you will enjoy the

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:30.850 
anyways I hope that you will enjoy the
seed<00:05:28.850> I<00:05:29.060> think<00:05:29.419> it's<00:05:29.540> a<00:05:29.660> great<00:05:30.020> one<00:05:30.229> maybe

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:30.860 
seed I think it's a great one maybe

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:32.740 
seed I think it's a great one maybe
let's<00:05:31.100> just<00:05:31.190> go<00:05:31.580> back<00:05:31.760> by<00:05:32.000> killing<00:05:32.570> myself

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:32.750 
let's just go back by killing myself

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:34.690 
let's just go back by killing myself
here<00:05:33.289> you<00:05:33.320> can<00:05:33.530> even<00:05:33.740> see<00:05:33.979> that<00:05:34.010> this<00:05:34.370> is<00:05:34.520> not

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:34.700 
here you can even see that this is not

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:37.480 
here you can even see that this is not
really<00:05:34.970> working<00:05:35.570> as<00:05:35.900> it<00:05:36.050> should<00:05:36.260> be<00:05:36.410> but<00:05:37.130> yeah

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:37.490 
really working as it should be but yeah
