00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
was owned by sea doo and this was

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.200 
was owned by sea doo and this was
actually<00:00:34.739> taken<00:00:35.160> before<00:00:35.280> the<00:00:35.579> wild<00:00:35.730> weekend

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.970 
actually taken before the wild weekend
so<00:00:36.420> it<00:00:36.510> was<00:00:36.630> actually<00:00:36.780> really<00:00:37.260> rare<00:00:37.559> item<00:00:37.829> then

no<00:00:45.750> one<00:00:45.780> naturally<00:00:46.320> where's<00:00:46.559> I<00:00:46.890> mean<00:00:47.250> not<00:00:47.940> that

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
no one naturally where's I mean not that

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.670 
no one naturally where's I mean not that
many<00:00:48.270> people<00:00:48.390> wear<00:00:48.989> them<00:00:49.140> anyway<00:00:49.410> probably

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
many people wear them anyway probably

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.299 
many people wear them anyway probably
but<00:00:50.579> now<00:00:51.300> that<00:00:51.510> they're<00:00:52.079> really<00:00:52.260> common<00:00:52.770> it

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
but now that they're really common it

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:54.979 
but now that they're really common it
sort<00:00:53.699> of<00:00:53.730> gets<00:00:53.879> rid<00:00:54.090> of<00:00:54.149> the<00:00:54.300> whole<00:00:54.449> appeal<00:00:54.690> for

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
sort of gets rid of the whole appeal for

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.340 
sort of gets rid of the whole appeal for
them<00:00:55.879> but<00:00:56.879> this<00:00:57.090> one's<00:00:57.360> the<00:00:57.420> bolt<00:00:57.660> at<00:00:57.899> you

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
anyway that's probably one of my
