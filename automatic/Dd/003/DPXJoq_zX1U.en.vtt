the<00:00:00.329> destruction<00:00:00.570> sounds<00:00:00.989> going<00:00:01.410> back<00:00:01.530> to

00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:01.650 
the destruction sounds going back to

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:02.899 
the destruction sounds going back to
that<00:00:01.680> previously<00:00:02.100> like<00:00:02.460> you're<00:00:02.610> saying<00:00:02.790> we're

00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:02.909 
that previously like you're saying we're

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:06.079 
that previously like you're saying we're
going<00:00:03.060> through<00:00:03.210> libraries<00:00:03.360> and<00:00:03.720> stuff<00:00:05.089> like

00:00:06.079 --> 00:00:06.089 
going through libraries and stuff like

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:07.490 
going through libraries and stuff like
we<00:00:06.299> still<00:00:06.509> did<00:00:06.690> a<00:00:06.720> whole<00:00:06.930> lot<00:00:07.170> of<00:00:07.200> like

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500 
we still did a whole lot of like

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.230 
we still did a whole lot of like
interesting<00:00:08.220> sound<00:00:08.490> designing<00:00:08.970> kind<00:00:09.120> of

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
interesting sound designing kind of

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:10.870 
interesting sound designing kind of
things<00:00:09.450> like<00:00:09.719> like<00:00:10.440> in<00:00:10.620> your<00:00:10.740> average

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:10.880 
things like like in your average

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:12.890 
things like like in your average
concrete<00:00:11.880> hit<00:00:12.059> you<00:00:12.179> know<00:00:12.300> your<00:00:12.809> average

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
concrete hit you know your average

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.270 
concrete hit you know your average
sample<00:00:13.320> libraries<00:00:13.590> not<00:00:13.650> going<00:00:13.860> to<00:00:13.920> have<00:00:14.070> you

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
sample libraries not going to have you

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.160 
sample libraries not going to have you
know<00:00:14.370> building<00:00:14.910> destroyed<00:00:15.120> so<00:00:15.809> we<00:00:15.900> had<00:00:16.049> to

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
know building destroyed so we had to

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:17.930 
know building destroyed so we had to
take<00:00:16.289> like<00:00:16.529> concrete<00:00:17.070> hitting<00:00:17.400> ground<00:00:17.609> and

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
take like concrete hitting ground and

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.140 
take like concrete hitting ground and
keys<00:00:18.539> jangling<00:00:19.020> and<00:00:19.350> dogs<00:00:20.160> barking<00:00:20.730> and<00:00:21.000> you

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
keys jangling and dogs barking and you

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:22.790 
keys jangling and dogs barking and you
know<00:00:21.240> all<00:00:21.480> times<00:00:21.720> like<00:00:21.930> Sam<00:00:22.260> following<00:00:22.680> all

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
know all times like Sam following all

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.290 
know all times like Sam following all
kinds<00:00:23.010> and<00:00:23.100> layer<00:00:23.490> it<00:00:23.609> all<00:00:23.789> together<00:00:23.970> into

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
kinds and layer it all together into

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.500 
kinds and layer it all together into
like<00:00:24.480> giant<00:00:24.960> massive<00:00:25.820> clusters<00:00:26.820> of<00:00:27.230> goodness

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:29.510 
like giant massive clusters of goodness

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:33.049 
like giant massive clusters of goodness
yeah<00:00:30.510> so<00:00:31.260> cluster<00:00:31.949> is<00:00:32.070> the<00:00:32.579> way<00:00:32.669> to<00:00:32.730> describe

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
yeah so cluster is the way to describe

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.330 
yeah so cluster is the way to describe
it<00:00:33.270> it's<00:00:33.630> a<00:00:33.690> big<00:00:33.809> layering<00:00:34.050> process<00:00:34.350> yeah<00:00:35.130> we

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
it it's a big layering process yeah we

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.729 
it it's a big layering process yeah we
use<00:00:36.030> a<00:00:36.059> lot<00:00:36.210> of<00:00:36.420> different<00:00:36.570> sound<00:00:37.290> effects<00:00:37.559> to

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
use a lot of different sound effects to

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.500 
use a lot of different sound effects to
get<00:00:37.890> this<00:00:38.129> feel<00:00:38.460> that<00:00:38.640> way<00:00:38.760> next<00:00:39.090> time<00:00:39.300> though

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
get this feel that way next time though

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.080 
get this feel that way next time though
we're<00:00:39.930> gonna<00:00:40.110> destroy<00:00:40.500> some<00:00:40.710> similar<00:00:41.219> so<00:00:41.790> stop

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
we're gonna destroy some similar so stop

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.369 
we're gonna destroy some similar so stop
some<00:00:42.329> scotch<00:00:42.660> yeah<00:00:42.780> we're<00:00:42.960> gonna<00:00:43.079> go<00:00:43.350> to

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
some scotch yeah we're gonna go to

00:00:43.379 --> 00:01:37.440 
some scotch yeah we're gonna go to
junkyard<00:00:43.770> into<00:00:44.190> some<00:00:44.370> carrot<00:00:44.700> up<00:00:44.820> yeah

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:47.420 
how did you guys get the different audio

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.210 
how did you guys get the different audio
sounds<00:01:47.750> or<00:01:47.870> is<00:01:48.140> there<00:01:48.410> differences<00:01:48.979> between

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:49.220 
sounds or is there differences between

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:50.620 
sounds or is there differences between
like<00:01:49.550> you<00:01:49.670> know<00:01:49.760> breaking<00:01:50.090> through<00:01:50.300> say

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 
like you know breaking through say

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:55.150 
like you know breaking through say
concrete<00:01:51.260> steel<00:01:52.210> human<00:01:53.210> flesh<00:01:53.600> and<00:01:53.810> bones<00:01:54.160> you

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:55.160 
concrete steel human flesh and bones you

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:56.590 
concrete steel human flesh and bones you
know<00:01:55.190> is<00:01:55.610> there<00:01:55.790> any<00:01:55.940> difference<00:01:56.180> you<00:01:56.570> know

00:01:57.969 --> 00:01:57.979 
what did you guys do to actually get

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:02.040 
what did you guys do to actually get
those<00:01:58.190> combined<00:01:59.180> and<00:01:59.420> to<00:01:59.570> make<00:01:59.750> it<00:01:59.869> dynamic

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:02.050 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:04.600 

what<00:02:03.050> we<00:02:03.170> have<00:02:03.320> to<00:02:03.470> do<00:02:03.619> in<00:02:03.800> order<00:02:03.920> to<00:02:04.220> get<00:02:04.369> all

what we have to do in order to get all

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:06.250 
what we have to do in order to get all
the<00:02:04.820> materials<00:02:05.300> sounding<00:02:05.660> correct<00:02:05.930> is<00:02:06.080> work

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:06.260 
the materials sounding correct is work

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.139 
the materials sounding correct is work
very<00:02:06.650> very<00:02:06.770> closely<00:02:07.160> with<00:02:07.640> our<00:02:07.670> artist

do is they make sure to note which
materials<00:02:14.000> the<00:02:14.239> stuff<00:02:14.450> they're<00:02:14.690> making<00:02:15.200> are

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
materials the stuff they're making are

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.350 
materials the stuff they're making are
made<00:02:15.560> out<00:02:15.739> of<00:02:15.770> so<00:02:16.250> when<00:02:16.730> they<00:02:16.820> put<00:02:17.030> together<00:02:17.120> a

made out of so when they put together a

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.270 
made out of so when they put together a
metal<00:02:17.690> building<00:02:17.840> they're<00:02:18.290> sure<00:02:18.500> to<00:02:18.709> mark<00:02:18.920> you

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
metal building they're sure to mark you

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.490

sledgehammer<00:02:40.520> it<00:02:40.640> impacts<00:02:40.880> on<00:02:41.060> that<00:02:41.239> you<00:02:41.299> guys

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420 
sledgehammer it impacts on that you guys

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.870 
sledgehammer it impacts on that you guys
asked<00:02:41.660> about<00:02:41.750> earlier<00:02:42.080> yes<00:02:43.010> we<00:02:43.280> also<00:02:43.400> taken<00:02:43.790> to

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:43.880 
asked about earlier yes we also taken to

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.289 
asked about earlier yes we also taken to
a<00:02:43.910> kind<00:02:44.090> of<00:02:44.120> shape<00:02:44.420> of<00:02:44.799> cylindrical<00:02:46.299> pipe

00:02:47.289 --> 00:02:47.299 
a kind of shape of cylindrical pipe

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:49.810 
a kind of shape of cylindrical pipe
sound<00:02:47.840> different<00:02:48.350> than<00:02:48.380> flat<00:02:48.799> level<00:02:49.310> eight

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:49.820 
sound different than flat level eight

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:51.820 
sound different than flat level eight
tons<00:02:50.150> of<00:02:50.299> different<00:02:50.360> metal<00:02:50.810> sounds<00:02:51.170> yeah<00:02:51.350> yeah

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:51.830 
tons of different metal sounds yeah yeah

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:53.770 
tons of different metal sounds yeah yeah
and<00:02:52.250> so<00:02:52.459> and<00:02:52.670> we<00:02:52.730> also<00:02:52.880> know<00:02:53.030> if<00:02:53.390> is<00:02:53.630> the

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
and so and we also know if is the

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:56.440 
and so and we also know if is the
concrete<00:02:54.260> like<00:02:54.470> sliding<00:02:55.010> is<00:02:55.459> it<00:02:55.610> rolling<00:02:56.090> did

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
concrete like sliding is it rolling did

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:59.199 
concrete like sliding is it rolling did
it<00:02:56.540> just<00:02:56.570> impact<00:02:57.290> the<00:02:57.500> ground<00:02:57.769> so<00:02:58.580> all<00:02:58.790> of<00:02:58.820> that

00:02:59.199 --> 00:02:59.209 
it just impact the ground so all of that

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:00.580 
it just impact the ground so all of that
will<00:02:59.420> queue<00:02:59.630> up<00:02:59.750> different<00:03:00.110> sound<00:03:00.290> effects

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
will queue up different sound effects

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:03.820 
will queue up different sound effects
depending<00:03:00.950> on<00:03:01.100> the<00:03:01.580> situation<00:03:02.830> bodies

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:03.830 
depending on the situation bodies

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:05.350 
depending on the situation bodies
falling<00:03:04.130> has<00:03:04.489> a<00:03:04.519> different<00:03:04.880> sound<00:03:05.030> than<00:03:05.239> the

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:05.360 
falling has a different sound than the

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:06.729 
falling has a different sound than the
concrete<00:03:05.870> falling<00:03:06.079> and<00:03:06.380> we're<00:03:06.470> able<00:03:06.590> to

00:03:06.729 --> 00:03:06.739 
concrete falling and we're able to

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:08.740 
concrete falling and we're able to
assign<00:03:07.070> that<00:03:07.310> after<00:03:07.940> working<00:03:08.120> with<00:03:08.360> artists

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
assign that after working with artists

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:10.840 
assign that after working with artists
and<00:03:08.840> programmers<00:03:08.959> to<00:03:09.470> get<00:03:09.620> what<00:03:09.739> we<00:03:09.829> want<00:03:10.070> the

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:10.850 
and programmers to get what we want the

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:13.090 
and programmers to get what we want the
cool<00:03:11.090> thing<00:03:11.299> is<00:03:11.450> because<00:03:12.350> the<00:03:12.440> Xbox<00:03:12.860> has<00:03:13.040> a

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:13.100 
cool thing is because the Xbox has a

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:15.610 
cool thing is because the Xbox has a
gazillion<00:03:13.519> petabytes<00:03:14.090> of<00:03:14.209> memory<00:03:14.540> we<00:03:15.410> have

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
gazillion petabytes of memory we have

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:17.289 
gazillion petabytes of memory we have
like<00:03:15.829> tons<00:03:16.130> of<00:03:16.370> different<00:03:16.549> variations<00:03:17.180> of

00:03:17.289 --> 00:03:17.299 
like tons of different variations of

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:18.520 
like tons of different variations of
each<00:03:17.480> sound<00:03:17.780> that<00:03:17.959> are<00:03:18.049> very<00:03:18.110> subtle

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530 
each sound that are very subtle

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:20.319 
each sound that are very subtle
differences<00:03:18.950> you<00:03:19.130> know<00:03:19.250> like<00:03:19.400> the<00:03:19.549> concrete

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:20.329 
differences you know like the concrete

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:22.210 
differences you know like the concrete
ten<00:03:20.840> different<00:03:21.049> pieces<00:03:21.380> of<00:03:21.590> concrete<00:03:21.709> hitting

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220 
ten different pieces of concrete hitting

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:24.759 
ten different pieces of concrete hitting
and<00:03:22.370> because<00:03:22.970> of<00:03:23.000> that<00:03:23.120> we<00:03:23.959> can<00:03:24.560> have

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:24.769 
and because of that we can have

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:27.039 
and because of that we can have
variations<00:03:25.670> so<00:03:25.850> that<00:03:26.030> each<00:03:26.209> block<00:03:26.570> that<00:03:26.780> falls

00:03:27.039 --> 00:03:27.049 
variations so that each block that falls

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:28.569 
variations so that each block that falls
has<00:03:27.290> a<00:03:27.320> slightly<00:03:27.709> different<00:03:27.950> sound<00:03:28.280> so<00:03:28.489> it

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:28.579 
has a slightly different sound so it

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:30.100 
has a slightly different sound so it
doesn't<00:03:28.850> sound<00:03:28.970> like<00:03:29.120> the<00:03:29.329> exact<00:03:29.660> same<00:03:29.840> thing

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:30.110 
doesn't sound like the exact same thing

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:31.690 
doesn't sound like the exact same thing
over<00:03:30.230> and<00:03:30.350> over<00:03:30.500> again<00:03:30.620> our<00:03:31.130> ears<00:03:31.370> are<00:03:31.519> very

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:31.700 
over and over again our ears are very

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:35.530 
over and over again our ears are very
good<00:03:31.850> at<00:03:31.970> detecting<00:03:33.700> when<00:03:34.700> a<00:03:34.730> particular

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:35.540 
good at detecting when a particular

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:38.979 
good at detecting when a particular
sound<00:03:35.840> is<00:03:35.989> repeated<00:03:36.860> over<00:03:36.980> and<00:03:37.070> over<00:03:37.220> again<00:03:37.989> so

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:38.989 
sound is repeated over and over again so

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:41.500 
sound is repeated over and over again so
this<00:03:39.500> helps<00:03:39.650> get<00:03:40.400> rid<00:03:40.430> of<00:03:40.579> that<00:03:40.790> effect<00:03:41.239> I

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:41.510 
this helps get rid of that effect I

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:42.840 
this helps get rid of that effect I
think<00:03:41.840> that's<00:03:41.959> one<00:03:42.110> of<00:03:42.140> the

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:42.850 
think that's one of the

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:44.640 
think that's one of the
challenges<00:03:43.510> for<00:03:43.660> sound<00:03:44.080> design<00:03:44.380> especially

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:44.650 
challenges for sound design especially

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:48.090 
challenges for sound design especially
in<00:03:45.130> this<00:03:45.280> type<00:03:45.460> of<00:03:46.260> arbitrary<00:03:47.260> destruction<00:03:47.890> is

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:48.100 
in this type of arbitrary destruction is

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:51.270 
in this type of arbitrary destruction is
making<00:03:48.850> it<00:03:48.940> sound<00:03:49.120> fresh<00:03:49.450> and<00:03:50.040> arbitrary<00:03:51.040> each

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:51.280 
making it sound fresh and arbitrary each

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.220 
making it sound fresh and arbitrary each
time<00:03:51.610> you<00:03:51.820> did<00:03:52.000> you<00:03:52.630> don't<00:03:52.780> want<00:03:52.900> to<00:03:52.960> hear<00:03:53.080> the

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:53.230 
time you did you don't want to hear the

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:54.900 
time you did you don't want to hear the
same<00:03:53.470> thing<00:03:53.860> every<00:03:54.190> time<00:03:54.220> you<00:03:54.490> know<00:03:54.580> destroy

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:54.910 
same thing every time you know destroy

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:57.090 
same thing every time you know destroy
metal<00:03:55.330> so<00:03:55.900> we<00:03:56.140> try<00:03:56.380> to<00:03:56.440> make<00:03:56.650> sure<00:03:56.860> to<00:03:57.010> have

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:57.100 
metal so we try to make sure to have

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:58.710 
metal so we try to make sure to have
enough<00:03:57.160> variation<00:03:57.550> to<00:03:58.360> get<00:03:58.540> rid<00:03:58.690> of

00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:58.720 
enough variation to get rid of

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:05.280 
enough variation to get rid of
repetition<00:04:03.270> okay<00:04:04.270> another<00:04:04.810> question<00:04:04.900> this

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.290 
repetition okay another question this

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:07.980 
repetition okay another question this
one's<00:04:05.530> kind<00:04:06.280> of<00:04:06.340> fun<00:04:06.520> too<00:04:06.760> what<00:04:07.540> about<00:04:07.630> all<00:04:07.750> the

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:07.990 
one's kind of fun too what about all the

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:10.380 
one's kind of fun too what about all the
audio<00:04:08.350> for<00:04:08.710> like<00:04:09.040> the<00:04:09.310> random<00:04:09.910> civilians

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:10.390 
audio for like the random civilians

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:12.420 
audio for like the random civilians
around<00:04:10.480> the<00:04:10.720> game<00:04:10.870> the<00:04:11.080> EDF<00:04:11.410> soldiers<00:04:11.440> you

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:12.430 
around the game the EDF soldiers you

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:14.550 
around the game the EDF soldiers you
know<00:04:12.520> um<00:04:12.760> where<00:04:13.600> did<00:04:13.690> you<00:04:13.810> guys<00:04:13.960> think<00:04:14.200> of<00:04:14.440> the

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:14.560 
know um where did you guys think of the

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:16.440 
know um where did you guys think of the
audio<00:04:14.830> when<00:04:15.040> like<00:04:15.310> say<00:04:15.550> you<00:04:15.610> stick<00:04:16.000> an<00:04:16.120> EDF

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:16.450 
audio when like say you stick an EDF

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:19.229 
audio when like say you stick an EDF
soldier<00:04:16.930> with<00:04:17.860> a<00:04:17.890> remote<00:04:18.190> charge<00:04:18.520> what<00:04:19.120> does

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:19.239 
soldier with a remote charge what does

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:20.820 
soldier with a remote charge what does
he<00:04:19.360> actually<00:04:19.540> say<00:04:19.960> you<00:04:20.170> know<00:04:20.230> what's<00:04:20.500> going<00:04:20.710> on

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:20.830 
he actually say you know what's going on

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:22.410 
he actually say you know what's going on
there<00:04:20.950> while<00:04:21.070> we<00:04:21.220> try<00:04:21.430> and<00:04:21.489> while<00:04:22.270> we're

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:22.420 
there while we try and while we're

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:23.400 
there while we try and while we're
playing<00:04:22.540> over<00:04:22.900> there<00:04:22.990> and<00:04:23.140> talking<00:04:23.290> about

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:23.410 
playing over there and talking about
