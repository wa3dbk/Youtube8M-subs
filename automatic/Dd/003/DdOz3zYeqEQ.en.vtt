first thing I notice getting in this car
is<00:04:27.460> that<00:04:27.490> it's<00:04:27.730> very<00:04:27.790> smooth<00:04:28.690> that<00:04:29.500> that<00:04:29.680> damn

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:29.950 
is that it's very smooth that that damn

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:32.850 
is that it's very smooth that that damn
handbrake<00:04:30.580> is<00:04:30.610> in<00:04:30.940> my<00:04:31.090> way<00:04:31.330> that<00:04:32.050> one<00:04:32.260> to<00:04:32.500> shift
