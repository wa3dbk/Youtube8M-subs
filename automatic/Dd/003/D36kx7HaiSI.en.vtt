00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
gonna hear a lot of numbers and for some

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.570 
gonna hear a lot of numbers and for some
reason<00:02:12.300> some<00:02:12.540> people<00:02:12.570> either<00:02:13.440> don't<00:02:14.190> mind<00:02:14.459> the

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
reason some people either don't mind the

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.050 
reason some people either don't mind the
numbers<00:02:14.910> or<00:02:15.530> then<00:02:16.530> they<00:02:16.890> do<00:02:17.370> mind<00:02:17.640> the<00:02:17.760> numbers

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:23.720 
send out all the imperfections and all
the<00:03:20.820> paint<00:03:21.060> and<00:03:21.959> that<00:03:22.830> way<00:03:23.040> when<00:03:23.250> I<00:03:23.280> clear<00:03:23.640> it

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
the paint and that way when I clear it

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.990 
the paint and that way when I clear it
again<00:03:24.000> it<00:03:24.840> will<00:03:25.140> be<00:03:25.290> perfect<00:03:25.950> and<00:03:26.130> then<00:03:26.820> all<00:03:26.970> I

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
again it will be perfect and then all I

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.479 
again it will be perfect and then all I
got<00:03:27.239> to<00:03:27.330> do<00:03:27.450> is<00:03:27.620> wet<00:03:28.620> sand<00:03:28.860> it<00:03:28.980> down<00:03:29.130> with<00:03:29.340> about

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 
got to do is wet sand it down with about

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:33.590 
got to do is wet sand it down with about
a<00:03:29.610> thousand<00:03:30.120> grit<00:03:30.269> or<00:03:30.720> 1500<00:03:31.530> and<00:03:32.360> then<00:03:33.360> make<00:03:33.570> it

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:33.600 
a thousand grit or 1500 and then make it

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:35.180 
a thousand grit or 1500 and then make it
happen<00:03:33.720> see<00:03:34.200> now<00:03:34.350> you<00:03:34.440> can<00:03:34.709> see<00:03:34.920> how<00:03:35.130> the

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
happen see now you can see how the

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:37.160 
happen see now you can see how the
ridges<00:03:35.610> are<00:03:35.730> right<00:03:35.910> here<00:03:36.090> if<00:03:36.630> I<00:03:36.720> stand<00:03:36.989> this<00:03:37.109> a

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
ridges are right here if I stand this a

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:40.580 
ridges are right here if I stand this a
little<00:03:37.350> bit<00:03:37.530> the<00:03:38.040> ridges<00:03:38.430> disappear<00:03:39.440> and<00:03:40.440> it

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
little bit the ridges disappear and it

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:42.080 
little bit the ridges disappear and it
doesn't<00:03:40.950> take<00:03:41.100> much<00:03:41.130> just

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
doesn't take much just

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:44.240 
doesn't take much just
little<00:03:42.239> bit<00:03:42.360> but<00:03:43.050> you<00:03:43.739> have<00:03:43.860> to<00:03:43.950> have<00:03:44.040> a<00:03:44.099> good

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
little bit but you have to have a good

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:47.420 
little bit but you have to have a good
eye<00:03:44.989> look<00:03:45.989> at<00:03:46.080> most<00:03:46.769> the<00:03:46.890> ridges<00:03:47.160> are<00:03:47.310> gone

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
eye look at most the ridges are gone

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.610 
eye look at most the ridges are gone
when<00:03:47.580> I<00:03:47.610> go<00:03:47.790> over<00:03:47.940> that<00:03:48.030> with<00:03:48.209> nuclear<00:03:48.810> that'll

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
when I go over that with nuclear that'll

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.650 
when I go over that with nuclear that'll
all<00:03:49.800> disappear<00:03:50.400> but<00:03:51.060> you're<00:03:51.209> trying<00:03:51.420> to<00:03:51.510> get

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 
all disappear but you're trying to get

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:53.570 
all disappear but you're trying to get
rid<00:03:51.780> of<00:03:51.900> things<00:03:52.019> like<00:03:52.170> this<00:03:52.319> see<00:03:53.160> right<00:03:53.370> there

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:53.580 
rid of things like this see right there

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:55.309 
rid of things like this see right there
little<00:03:54.209> knots<00:03:54.510> like<00:03:54.750> that<00:03:54.930> you're<00:03:55.050> trying<00:03:55.290> to

00:03:55.309 --> 00:03:55.319 
little knots like that you're trying to

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:57.890 
little knots like that you're trying to
get<00:03:55.470> rid<00:03:55.620> of<00:03:55.650> because<00:03:56.340> this<00:03:56.640> is<00:03:56.849> higher<00:03:57.150> than

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
get rid of because this is higher than

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:59.660 
get rid of because this is higher than
what<00:03:58.140> the<00:03:58.260> clear<00:03:58.500> is<00:03:58.650> so<00:03:59.250> you're<00:03:59.370> trying<00:03:59.580> to

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
what the clear is so you're trying to

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:02.690 
what the clear is so you're trying to
make<00:03:59.790> it<00:03:59.819> all<00:04:00.030> nice<00:04:00.209> and<00:04:00.480> flat<00:04:00.660> now<00:04:01.519> I've<00:04:02.519> been

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:02.700 
make it all nice and flat now I've been

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:05.660 
make it all nice and flat now I've been
on<00:04:02.849> this<00:04:03.060> for<00:04:03.810> about<00:04:04.110> a<00:04:04.140> day<00:04:04.379> and<00:04:04.410> a<00:04:04.530> half<00:04:04.670> going

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:05.670 
on this for about a day and a half going

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:08.869 
on this for about a day and a half going
over<00:04:06.000> the<00:04:06.120> whole<00:04:06.269> thing<00:04:06.330> and<00:04:06.799> I<00:04:07.799> should<00:04:08.790> be

00:04:08.869 --> 00:04:08.879 
over the whole thing and I should be

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:10.820 
over the whole thing and I should be
ready<00:04:09.090> to<00:04:09.209> clear<00:04:09.420> by<00:04:09.660> maybe<00:04:10.049> tomorrow<00:04:10.410> morning

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:10.830 
ready to clear by maybe tomorrow morning

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:13.670 
ready to clear by maybe tomorrow morning
and<00:04:10.980> that's<00:04:11.670> how<00:04:12.000> you<00:04:12.870> get<00:04:13.049> the<00:04:13.200> glass<00:04:13.379> paint

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 
and that's how you get the glass paint

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.390 
and that's how you get the glass paint
job<00:04:13.890> this<00:04:14.370> is<00:04:14.579> why<00:04:14.880> it<00:04:14.940> takes<00:04:15.480> so<00:04:15.810> long<00:04:15.989> and<00:04:16.859> why

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400 
job this is why it takes so long and why

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:20.870 
job this is why it takes so long and why
it's<00:04:17.579> kind<00:04:18.269> of<00:04:18.329> costly<00:04:18.750> this<00:04:19.109> is<00:04:19.459> the<00:04:20.459> step

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 
it's kind of costly this is the step

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:25.040 
it's kind of costly this is the step
that<00:04:22.220> most<00:04:23.220> painters<00:04:23.550> hate<00:04:23.760> because<00:04:24.270> we<00:04:24.900> like

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.050 
that most painters hate because we like

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:26.920 
that most painters hate because we like
to<00:04:25.139> have<00:04:25.229> fun<00:04:25.290> and<00:04:25.500> we<00:04:25.770> like<00:04:25.950> to<00:04:25.979> shoot<00:04:26.550> the

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:26.930 
to have fun and we like to shoot the

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:29.360 
to have fun and we like to shoot the
graphics<00:04:27.930> on<00:04:28.080> but<00:04:28.770> when<00:04:28.860> it<00:04:28.950> comes<00:04:29.130> time<00:04:29.310> to

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:29.370 
graphics on but when it comes time to

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:31.790 
graphics on but when it comes time to
really<00:04:29.790> do<00:04:29.940> the<00:04:30.060> work<00:04:30.090> this<00:04:30.990> is<00:04:31.260> when<00:04:31.470> the<00:04:31.620> work

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:31.800

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:34.909 
really do the work this is when the work
begins<00:04:32.310> but<00:04:33.120> the<00:04:33.600> payoff<00:04:33.990> is<00:04:34.020> absolutely

00:04:34.909 --> 00:04:34.919 
begins but the payoff is absolutely

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:37.310 
begins but the payoff is absolutely
awesome<00:04:35.400> because<00:04:36.389> when<00:04:36.870> you<00:04:37.020> get<00:04:37.169> this

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:37.320
