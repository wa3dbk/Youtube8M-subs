temporarily while you practice this

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:16.760 
temporarily while you practice this
getting<00:00:15.690> it<00:00:15.780> into<00:00:15.960> the<00:00:16.080> exact<00:00:16.440> right<00:00:16.619> spot

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
getting it into the exact right spot

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:17.420 
getting it into the exact right spot
every<00:00:17.070> time

the<00:00:17.730> technique<00:00:18.180> is<00:00:18.560> the<00:00:19.560> super<00:00:19.920> simple

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
the technique is the super simple

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.340 
the technique is the super simple
technique<00:00:20.580> is<00:00:20.789> pull<00:00:21.029> the<00:00:21.180> rod<00:00:21.359> firmly<00:00:21.750> to<00:00:22.320> the

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
technique is pull the rod firmly to the

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.080 
technique is pull the rod firmly to the
wall<00:00:22.769> but<00:00:23.039> slowly<00:00:24.289> let<00:00:25.289> you<00:00:25.980> bring<00:00:26.189> the<00:00:26.369> bumper

wall but slowly let you bring the bumper
to<00:00:27.330> the<00:00:27.750> wall<00:00:28.140> keep<00:00:28.859> it<00:00:29.010> on<00:00:29.130> the<00:00:29.250> wall<00:00:29.400> and

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
to the wall keep it on the wall and

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.749 
to the wall keep it on the wall and
it'll<00:00:30.170> gently<00:00:31.170> bounce<00:00:31.410> back<00:00:31.710> and<00:00:31.980> then<00:00:32.430> kind

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
it'll gently bounce back and then kind

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.180 
it'll gently bounce back and then kind
of<00:00:32.820> caress<00:00:33.270> it<00:00:33.510> decelerating<00:00:34.320> the<00:00:34.350> ball<00:00:34.649> down

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
of caress it decelerating the ball down

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.760 
of caress it decelerating the ball down
from<00:00:35.489> there<00:00:35.700> to<00:00:35.850> there<00:00:36.000> and<00:00:36.570> the<00:00:37.320> good<00:00:37.500> test

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
from there to there and the good test

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.260 
from there to there and the good test
for<00:00:38.040> this<00:00:38.129> is<00:00:38.370> it<00:00:38.640> to<00:00:38.790> get<00:00:38.910> it<00:00:39.030> in<00:00:39.090> the<00:00:39.180> right

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
for this is it to get it in the right

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.470 
for this is it to get it in the right
spot<00:00:39.540> is<00:00:40.219> you<00:00:41.219> can<00:00:41.399> put<00:00:41.670> this<00:00:41.700> second<00:00:42.360> guy

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
spot is you can put this second guy

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.690 
spot is you can put this second guy
right<00:00:43.320> behind<00:00:43.620> it<00:00:43.890> and<00:00:44.040> it<00:00:44.309> lines<00:00:44.489> up

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
right behind it and it lines up

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.700 
right behind it and it lines up
perfectly<00:00:45.180> you'll<00:00:45.629> even<00:00:45.809> see<00:00:45.899> Billy<00:00:46.260> Pappas

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
perfectly you'll even see Billy Pappas

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.319 
perfectly you'll even see Billy Pappas
and<00:00:46.950> other<00:00:47.430> people<00:00:47.760> doing<00:00:48.000> that<00:00:48.149> during

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
and other people doing that during

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
matches sometimes just getting it in

anything else because it basically
eventually<00:01:04.170> you<00:01:04.530> want<00:01:04.710> to<00:01:04.769> be<00:01:04.830> able<00:01:04.920> to<00:01:05.010> do

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
eventually you want to be able to do

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:06.649 
eventually you want to be able to do
classes<00:01:05.549> with<00:01:05.700> your<00:01:05.820> eyes<00:01:05.939> closed<00:01:06.299> and<00:01:06.570> this

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
classes with your eyes closed and this

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.700 
classes with your eyes closed and this
is<00:01:06.840> will<00:01:07.710> build<00:01:07.920> the<00:01:08.070> consistency<00:01:08.970> where<00:01:09.710> if

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
is will build the consistency where if

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.560 
is will build the consistency where if
you're<00:01:11.100> starting<00:01:11.430> passes<00:01:11.850> from<00:01:12.000> out<00:01:12.210> here<00:01:12.450> and

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
you're starting passes from out here and

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:13.820 
you're starting passes from out here and
stuff<00:01:12.720> that<00:01:12.840> are<00:01:12.930> very<00:01:13.080> substantially

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
stuff that are very substantially

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.980 
stuff that are very substantially
different<00:01:14.010> than<00:01:14.280> if<00:01:15.000> you<00:01:15.119> started<00:01:15.450> the<00:01:15.659> exact

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
different than if you started the exact

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.870 
different than if you started the exact
same<00:01:16.200> spot<00:01:16.470> every<00:01:16.530> time<00:01:16.890> and<00:01:17.130> this<00:01:17.430> spot<00:01:17.640> for

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
same spot every time and this spot for

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.730 
same spot every time and this spot for
Lane<00:01:18.150> will<00:01:18.509> pass<00:01:18.720> this<00:01:18.900> works<00:01:19.140> perfect

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
Lane will pass this works perfect

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.980 
Lane will pass this works perfect
because<00:01:20.310> you<00:01:21.000> only<00:01:21.150> have<00:01:21.330> to<00:01:21.479> drag<00:01:21.689> the<00:01:21.840> ball

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
because you only have to drag the ball

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.130 
because you only have to drag the ball
just<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.439> tiniest<00:01:22.860> little<00:01:23.100> bit<00:01:23.369> too<00:01:23.990> to<00:01:24.990> be

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
just the tiniest little bit too to be

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.929 
just the tiniest little bit too to be
able<00:01:25.229> to<00:01:25.409> hit<00:01:25.680> the<00:01:25.830> lane<00:01:26.009> pass<00:01:26.280> and<00:01:26.549> keep<00:01:26.729> them

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
able to hit the lane pass and keep them

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.760 
able to hit the lane pass and keep them
keep<00:01:27.900> make<00:01:28.439> them<00:01:28.650> use<00:01:28.979> the<00:01:29.189> full<00:01:29.430> range<00:01:29.670> of<00:01:29.880> the

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.770 
keep make them use the full range of the

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:33.200 
keep make them use the full range of the
full<00:01:31.770> range<00:01:31.979> of<00:01:32.159> the<00:01:32.250> rod<00:01:32.400> to<00:01:32.610> block<00:01:32.850> between

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
full range of the rod to block between

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.210 
full range of the rod to block between
so<00:01:33.990> it<00:01:34.700> do<00:01:35.700> it<00:01:35.850> like<00:01:36.030> that<00:01:36.740> let's<00:01:37.740> take<00:01:37.979> some

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
so it do it like that let's take some

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.010 
so it do it like that let's take some
time<00:01:38.250> in<00:01:38.610> itself<00:01:38.880> we'll<00:01:39.240> just<00:01:39.420> do<00:01:39.540> it<00:01:39.659> over<00:01:39.780> and

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
time in itself we'll just do it over and

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.880 
time in itself we'll just do it over and
over<00:01:40.259> and<00:01:40.350> over<00:01:41.630> you<00:01:42.630> can<00:01:42.659> also<00:01:42.960> you<00:01:43.619> can<00:01:43.740> also

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
over and over you can also you can also

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.530 
over and over you can also you can also
get<00:01:44.280> off<00:01:44.430> the<00:01:44.610> wall<00:01:44.790> like<00:01:44.970> that<00:01:45.000> but<00:01:45.329> I<00:01:45.420> don't

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
get off the wall like that but I don't

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.179 
get off the wall like that but I don't
recommend<00:01:45.750> it<00:01:45.960> because<00:01:46.170> there's<00:01:46.380> a<00:01:46.500> to<00:01:46.920> rule

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
recommend it because there's a to rule

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.670 
recommend it because there's a to rule
to<00:01:47.670> ball<00:01:47.939> rule<00:01:48.240> so<00:01:48.930> just<00:01:49.200> gives<00:01:49.380> you<00:01:49.470> a<00:01:49.500> guy
