00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:06.010
 we do not see how the leaves of a plant are distributed around the callao 

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:10.240
 starting with the first leaf we count the leaves around the stem until 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:13.530
 get to the contest xxx and on the first sheet 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.099
 for this plant and if the number 8 of gijÃ³n as 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.480
 when reviewing the growth cycle of the leaves we find that tomato and 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.300
 circles around the workshop to get to the eighth leaf 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.300
 the number 3 also comes out of the fibonacci sequence 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.019
 these numbers of life also for each plant in but almost 

00:00:36.019 --> 00:00:39.019
 and without grudges a very active installation in the cinema 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:44.310
 Transportation and the willingness to bid on flowers and trees 

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:46.840
 we will also find this sequence 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.200
 also in the points of sale and or in which leaves and branches are inserted 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.270
 but the relationship between botany and fibonacci does not stay there most 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:01:04.220
 of flowers trosel 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 were the theme of petals I really missed 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:10.240
 and is that in most plant species the number of leaves 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.570
 necessary to give a detailed full turn follows fibonacci numbers 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.190
 can be given with the leaves and a single turn on the trunk or with three leaves 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:24.650
 also with five well two full turns to the trunk or with eight leaves and 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:27.980
 three laps that even with more all fibonacci numbers 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:36.780
 in the heart of many flowers such as daisies or sunflowers 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:41.260
 we can also see if we pay attention spirals whose number in 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.640
 both senses correspond to correlated fibonacci numbers 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:50.270
 naturally the spirals are logistic type with this arrangement is 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:53.030
 get to take advantage of horizontal space more efficiently
