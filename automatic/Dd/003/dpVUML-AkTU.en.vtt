00:00:10.259 --> 00:00:14.199
 This 8 in the user test seems so I turn the headrest 

00:00:14.199 --> 00:00:15.650
 Doubt added to the example 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:17.289
 set exponent .set 

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:21.970
 After going to the rest area and doing fast after three steps 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:24.089
 Because it will be finished 

00:00:24.089 --> 00:00:27.059
 When I hit, I hit Crid's head properly 

00:00:27.059 --> 00:00:30.599
 This is also a function of 11 

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:35.350
 As a new apprentice of this place in the small city Taito ward of the same place 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:38.519
 It looks like it hasn't come out to that Bentley 

00:00:38.519 --> 00:00:41.519
 Right 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:45.480
 To hahahahaha 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.400
 So 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.400
 after that 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:57.370
 In such 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:00.370
 Inquiry is in the same building 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:05.780
 Kanagawa Ayase 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.770
 Price increase rush 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:16.100
 He did 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:17.470
 Kawara 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:20.470
 Maeba closing price 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.050
 We carry out facility 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:27.050
 From Kitakyushu City 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.470
 There are still lawsuits for such people 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:36.070
 I can see quite a bit of stress while selling a bit 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:36.990
 There was a feeling 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.870
 I think the shock is big 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:41.870
 In fact I think that a burden will be imposed on the chief 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.590
 Some excellent US presidential photographs such as 65 years are ahead of the decision 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.590
 Two people are gone by investigation such as 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.840
 Kato Saya is planning to give a present and a more difficult position 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.840
 It is equivalent to take 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:58.580
 It's a cartilage 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:01.430
 Beyond the limit soon from the doctor from fiscal 1984 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:04.190
 I was getting closer to driving 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:05.110
 Man 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:07.280
 There is also the former life 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.909
 I'm wearing a helmet 

00:02:09.909 --> 00:02:13.989
 In 8 schools and 1 army for the full year, it is not a problem 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:14.760
 It will be done 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.800
 Disappointment in the year of about 70 extra extra per person in a box set 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.130
 Even if it is natural, I think it is the time when it is only a splash sound 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:22.309
 is there 

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:24.949
 Always every day 211114 

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:28.409
 I heard the price by looking at the director's short story but take it every day 

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:29.799
 I have run away 

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:32.369
 Give a ticket to the bottom of the midfield 

00:02:32.369 --> 00:02:33.979
 It has never been said before 

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:35.350
 Other than that 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:37.290
 It seems that it is necessary to do it
