00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:14.719
 Threw 60 new helmets that I have for 

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:17.960
 listen to music and to talk and to 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:21.440
 record surely because they have a 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:23.510
 built-in micro but 

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:26.380
 then they will be the ones that I will use also what 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:28.700
 better to burn minecraft whatever 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:32.119
 well we can not upload videos much 

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:33.610
 video because I'm 16 years old the best two 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:35.410
 per week 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:37.830
 and well let's get the box out this is 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:37.830
 a box 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:43.710

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:50.130

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:51.660
 over here bluetooth all this has and 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:56.030
 Well, he has already opened them because he had a 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.030
 plastic and everything are these 

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:03.660

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:05.700
 is set jstor is here is what the 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.579
 reset 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:13.560
 the usb cable this is the reduction of 

00:01:08.579 --> 00:01:15.990
 noises to be able to load it I think it was 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.719
 no this is to put an hour what 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.260
 we'll see in the micro sd for the new 

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:24.310
 micro SD 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:27.160
 this to turn on or that the song is 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:28.930
 stop or follow the mobile to advance the 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:31.140
 song or rewind the volume it 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:33.820
 we pressed it came to raise the volume 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:37.600
 if we keep pressing this backs the 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:41.770
 volume or the next song this 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:43.820
 switch from radio mode to mp3 or micro mode 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:47.130
 sd 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:50.700
 take the calls and if I leave him expelled 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:53.549
 take the call from the previous number 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:56.630
 and well these are the helmets there is no 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:02:00.230
 much more good to attend as 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:03.470
 and it bends very easy and they are very comfortable 

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:08.050
 well let's leave for the municipality 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:08.050
 this is typical of the web for hits 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:13.430
 good is the case already that I here 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:16.340
 if for example you have a tablet like in 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:18.980
 my case does not have bluetooth but you have 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:21.800
 the mobile with bluetooth this moment is 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:24.830
 adaptable and this and the other will connect 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:27.500
 here then now we do not have both 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:29.330
 I have heard this is the cable for 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:33.720
 load it because you have to load the 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:38.220
 helmets on the site where they load on it 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:43.380
 as I said portable or in a source that 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:46.230
 have usb of the charge and blink the 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:47.520
 light when it stops with high and I'm in 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.630
 instruction manual as in the script 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.630
 from having a boxing 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:55.640
 and we go to the little bag where the 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:59.750
 helmets 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:01.780
 and they are already alone and I am not going to put it 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:01.780
 all 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:09.690
 good this gift from santa claus 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.409
 if there is no more 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:30.080
 i 

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:35.320
 well I'm going to cut this 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:41.910
 and well this I advise you to take because 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:44.520
 it's a very good to take a carrefour by 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:49.980
 almost 100 euros 

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:52.860
 it cost us 85 washing and they are very 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:54.330
 good that yes I just advice because I already 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:55.680
 I 've tried you because you buy us now 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:57.600
 the night and I'm doing in action by 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:01.620
 the morning 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:04.920
 and one pass is heard you put them and 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:12.110
 you do not listen outside no one puts us 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:15.530
 very poor listens but through the 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:15.530
 noise reduction 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:24.810
 you ask for abel alves 610 ya a 600 

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:29.530
 days later there is the bird 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:32.530
 611 that has the same as this is a 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:34.690
 little bit smaller and is a model 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:37.810
 annoyed the oldest but that did not have 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:40.720
 neither radio nor micro sd player 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:45.010
 and we take the kids that they 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:47.050
 of loading yes but good I think that already 

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:52.140
 Many are the unboxing of the 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:52.140
