clear picture when this is up I had to

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:16.960 
clear picture when this is up I had to
move<00:02:15.110> that<00:02:15.319> aside<00:02:15.439> so<00:02:15.799> I<00:02:15.860> could<00:02:16.040> spin<00:02:16.280> it<00:02:16.310> then

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
move that aside so I could spin it then

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.020 
move that aside so I could spin it then
you<00:02:17.060> lift<00:02:17.239> these<00:02:17.450> two<00:02:17.840> up<00:02:18.189> it<00:02:19.189> opens<00:02:19.670> up<00:02:19.879> the

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
you lift these two up it opens up the

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:21.610 
you lift these two up it opens up the
side<00:02:20.269> panel<00:02:20.659> I<00:02:20.689> didn't<00:02:20.930> want<00:02:21.049> that<00:02:21.200> to<00:02:21.379> lock

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
side panel I didn't want that to lock

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.330 
side panel I didn't want that to lock
down<00:02:22.269> you<00:02:23.269> see<00:02:23.480> now<00:02:23.659> that<00:02:23.930> swings<00:02:24.530> open<00:02:24.769> like

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
down you see now that swings open like

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.789 
down you see now that swings open like
so<00:02:25.700> when<00:02:26.540> you<00:02:26.689> close<00:02:26.989> the<00:02:27.290> lid

00:02:27.789 --> 00:02:27.799 
so when you close the lid

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:33.369 
so when you close the lid
it<00:02:28.280> pushes<00:02:28.700> these<00:02:29.090> down<00:02:29.510> and<00:02:30.439> locks<00:02:30.739> it<00:02:32.379> done

00:02:33.369 --> 00:02:33.379 
it pushes these down and locks it done

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:35.589 
it pushes these down and locks it done
the<00:02:33.500> last<00:02:33.709> thing<00:02:33.980> is<00:02:34.129> the<00:02:34.220> vacuuming<00:02:34.730> we<00:02:35.359> put<00:02:35.569> a

00:02:35.589 --> 00:02:35.599 
the last thing is the vacuuming we put a

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:38.649 
the last thing is the vacuuming we put a
brand<00:02:35.870> new<00:02:35.930> power<00:02:36.230> supply<00:02:36.530> in<00:02:37.239> okay<00:02:38.239> we<00:02:38.390> put<00:02:38.599> a

00:02:38.649 --> 00:02:38.659 
brand new power supply in okay we put a

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:40.479 
brand new power supply in okay we put a
new<00:02:38.810> capacitor<00:02:39.500> on<00:02:39.650> the<00:02:39.769> sound<00:02:40.099> board<00:02:40.310> the

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:40.489 
new capacitor on the sound board the

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:42.789 
new capacitor on the sound board the
sound<00:02:40.730> words<00:02:40.939> over<00:02:41.269> here<00:02:41.569> we<00:02:42.319> have<00:02:42.440> to<00:02:42.560> change

00:02:42.789 --> 00:02:42.799 
sound words over here we have to change

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:44.770 
sound words over here we have to change
one<00:02:43.040> speaker<00:02:43.519> to<00:02:43.549> we<00:02:43.819> had<00:02:43.970> one<00:02:44.120> bad<00:02:44.389> speaker

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
one speaker to we had one bad speaker

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.770 
one speaker to we had one bad speaker
and<00:02:45.139> here<00:02:46.129> is<00:02:46.310> our<00:02:46.489> logic<00:02:46.700> or<00:02:47.060> little<00:02:47.450> lithium

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
and here is our logic or little lithium

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.589 
and here is our logic or little lithium
battery<00:02:48.139> and<00:02:48.650> a<00:02:48.769> trick<00:02:49.069> connect<00:02:49.400> post<00:02:49.670> we<00:02:50.420> also

00:02:50.589 --> 00:02:50.599 
battery and a trick connect post we also

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:52.660 
battery and a trick connect post we also
changed<00:02:51.319> the<00:02:51.739> edge<00:02:51.920> connector

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:52.670 
changed the edge connector

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:55.149 
changed the edge connector
I've<00:02:53.060> put<00:02:53.329> the<00:02:53.420> Tri<00:02:53.720> Urich<00:02:54.109> on<00:02:54.349> connectors<00:02:54.980> on

00:02:55.149 --> 00:02:55.159 
I've put the Tri Urich on connectors on

00:02:55.159 --> 00:02:57.520 
I've put the Tri Urich on connectors on
it<00:02:55.189> that'll<00:02:55.909> grip<00:02:56.150> the<00:02:56.359> pins<00:02:56.659> on<00:02:56.989> all<00:02:57.170> three

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
it that'll grip the pins on all three

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:00.699 
it that'll grip the pins on all three
sides<00:02:57.939> so<00:02:58.939> the<00:02:59.510> customer<00:02:59.959> down<00:03:00.079> the<00:03:00.290> road<00:03:00.470> will

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:47.410 
all over the board which it would

you change the lithium battery you have
to<00:05:00.010> change<00:05:00.340> the<00:05:01.030> diode<00:05:01.570> on<00:05:01.990> Williams<00:05:02.410> games
