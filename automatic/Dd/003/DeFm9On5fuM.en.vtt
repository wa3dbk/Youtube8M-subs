two<00:00:00.179> part<00:00:00.450> gauge<00:00:00.719> the<00:00:01.350> first<00:00:01.620> needle<00:00:02.060> shows<00:00:03.060> us

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:04.370 
two part gauge the first needle shows us

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:08.419 
two part gauge the first needle shows us
steam<00:00:05.370> pressure<00:00:05.670> for<00:00:06.180> that<00:00:06.500> steam<00:00:07.500> jet<00:00:07.770> in<00:00:08.309> the

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
steam pressure for that steam jet in the

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:11.060 
steam pressure for that steam jet in the
firebox<00:00:08.880> and<00:00:09.179> the<00:00:10.050> white<00:00:10.260> needle<00:00:10.650> is<00:00:10.860> actually

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
firebox and the white needle is actually

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.020 
firebox and the white needle is actually
for<00:00:11.580> the<00:00:11.910> auger<00:00:12.150> the<00:00:12.599> stoker<00:00:13.490> you<00:00:14.490> can<00:00:14.670> control

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
for the auger the stoker you can control

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.609 
for the auger the stoker you can control
that<00:00:15.240> fighting<00:00:15.870> the<00:00:15.900> amount<00:00:16.139> of<00:00:16.230> steam<00:00:16.470> you

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
that fighting the amount of steam you

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.200 
that fighting the amount of steam you
give<00:00:16.830> it<00:00:16.980> you<00:00:17.070> can<00:00:17.130> make<00:00:17.310> it<00:00:17.369> run<00:00:17.640> slow<00:00:17.910> you<00:00:18.060> can

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
give it you can make it run slow you can

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.570 
give it you can make it run slow you can
make<00:00:18.330> it<00:00:18.480> run<00:00:18.570> faster<00:00:19.070> you're<00:00:20.070> running<00:00:20.340> slow

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
make it run faster you're running slow

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.099 
make it run faster you're running slow
you<00:00:20.789> run<00:00:20.939> it<00:00:21.060> nice<00:00:21.240> you<00:00:21.510> just<00:00:21.689> kind<00:00:21.840> of<00:00:21.930> creep

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
you run it nice you just kind of creep

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:28.820 
you run it nice you just kind of creep
it<00:00:24.710> this<00:00:25.710> gauge<00:00:26.010> here<00:00:26.750> which<00:00:27.750> is<00:00:27.930> not<00:00:28.500> up<00:00:28.680> it

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
it this gauge here which is not up it

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.859 
it this gauge here which is not up it
should<00:00:29.010> be<00:00:29.189> over<00:00:29.340> to<00:00:29.550> here<00:00:29.760> it<00:00:29.910> shows<00:00:30.390> us<00:00:30.660> the

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
should be over to here it shows us the

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.160 
should be over to here it shows us the
water<00:00:31.199> level<00:00:31.650> in<00:00:31.859> the<00:00:32.009> tender<00:00:32.809> so<00:00:33.809> we<00:00:33.930> know<00:00:34.050> how

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
water level in the tender so we know how

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.370 
water level in the tender so we know how
much<00:00:34.350> water<00:00:34.620> we<00:00:34.860> have<00:00:35.450> versus<00:00:36.450> was<00:00:36.660> up<00:00:37.020> here

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
much water we have versus was up here

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.220 
much water we have versus was up here
who's<00:00:37.829> the<00:00:37.950> water's<00:00:38.280> last<00:00:38.520> again<00:00:38.910> and<00:00:39.450> then

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
who's the water's last again and then

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.200 
who's the water's last again and then
all<00:00:40.520> these<00:00:41.520> breaths<00:00:41.969> hand<00:00:42.840> wheels<00:00:43.140> and

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:44.210 
all these breaths hand wheels and

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.150 
all these breaths hand wheels and
handles<00:00:45.289> they're<00:00:46.289> basically<00:00:46.860> different

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
handles they're basically different

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.750 
handles they're basically different
accessories<00:00:48.120> that<00:00:48.360> run<00:00:48.690> off<00:00:48.870> of<00:00:49.050> steam

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:49.760 
accessories that run off of steam

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.340 
accessories that run off of steam
there's<00:00:50.760> a<00:00:50.820> big<00:00:51.000> manifold<00:00:51.570> up<00:00:51.750> on<00:00:51.899> top<00:00:52.110> of<00:00:52.260> the

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
there's a big manifold up on top of the

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.680 
there's a big manifold up on top of the
engine<00:00:52.469> right<00:00:52.829> up<00:00:52.949> the<00:00:53.039> front<00:00:53.190> here<00:00:53.520> and<00:00:53.789> we

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
engine right up the front here and we

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.959 
engine right up the front here and we
can<00:00:54.899> turn<00:00:55.110> all<00:00:55.350> these<00:00:55.530> things<00:00:55.890> on<00:00:56.129> we<00:00:56.520> can<00:00:56.730> pick

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
can turn all these things on we can pick

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.000 
can turn all these things on we can pick
which<00:00:57.239> one<00:00:57.449> we<00:00:57.629> want<00:00:57.840> on<00:00:58.050> or<00:00:58.230> off<00:00:58.379> and<00:00:58.739> we<00:00:58.829> can

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
which one we want on or off and we can

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.740 
which one we want on or off and we can
just<00:00:59.129> do<00:00:59.280> that<00:01:00.829> some<00:01:01.829> of<00:01:01.949> these<00:01:02.039> are<00:01:02.309> very

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:02.750 
just do that some of these are very

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:04.549 
just do that some of these are very
intimidating<00:01:03.750> people<00:01:03.870> get<00:01:04.140> in<00:01:04.229> here<00:01:04.379> and<00:01:04.439> then

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
intimidating people get in here and then

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.700 
intimidating people get in here and then
look<00:01:04.710> at<00:01:04.830> all<00:01:04.949> these<00:01:05.100> knobs<00:01:05.430> and<00:01:05.760> they<00:01:05.850> go<00:01:06.000> low

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:06.710 
look at all these knobs and they go low

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:08.750 
look at all these knobs and they go low
that's<00:01:07.710> a<00:01:07.830> lot<00:01:08.040> but<00:01:08.220> it's<00:01:08.369> really<00:01:08.520> pretty

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
that's a lot but it's really pretty

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.510 
that's a lot but it's really pretty
simple

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.010 

we<00:01:11.579> were<00:01:11.700> main<00:01:12.090> steam<00:01:12.450> pressure<00:01:12.689> gage<00:01:13.049> a<00:01:15.020> water

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
we were main steam pressure gage a water

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.370 
we were main steam pressure gage a water
glass<00:01:16.259> again<00:01:17.659> and<00:01:18.659> this<00:01:18.780> is<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:19.110> throttle

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
glass again and this is the throttle

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.100 
glass again and this is the throttle
there's<00:01:19.830> big<00:01:20.070> brass<00:01:20.430> device<00:01:20.850> here<00:01:21.149> this<00:01:21.930> is

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
there's big brass device here this is

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.050 
there's big brass device here this is
the<00:01:22.229> throttle<00:01:22.710> and<00:01:22.860> it's<00:01:23.009> locked<00:01:23.520> for<00:01:24.030> a

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
the throttle and it's locked for a

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.899 
the throttle and it's locked for a
reason<00:01:24.649> when<00:01:25.649> the<00:01:25.770> engines<00:01:26.100> are<00:01:26.280> sitting<00:01:26.640> it's

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
reason when the engines are sitting it's

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.990 
reason when the engines are sitting it's
required<00:01:27.329> by<00:01:27.509> law<00:01:27.689> the<00:01:27.750> throttle<00:01:28.439> be<00:01:28.560> locked

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.000 
required by law the throttle be locked

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.999 
required by law the throttle be locked
that's<00:01:30.000> true<00:01:30.390> for<00:01:30.750> any<00:01:30.960> engine<00:01:31.409> today<00:01:31.679> they

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
that's true for any engine today they

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.980 
that's true for any engine today they
have<00:01:32.670> what<00:01:32.850> they<00:01:32.970> call<00:01:33.149> the<00:01:33.179> reverse<00:01:33.570> or<00:01:33.780> lever

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
have what they call the reverse or lever

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.749 
have what they call the reverse or lever
they<00:01:34.320> have<00:01:34.500> to<00:01:34.649> take<00:01:34.830> out<00:01:35.009> that<00:01:35.250> basically

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
they have to take out that basically

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.210 
they have to take out that basically
lock<00:01:35.970> the<00:01:36.270> engine<00:01:36.600> so<00:01:37.409> nobody<00:01:37.679> can<00:01:37.860> take<00:01:38.039> off

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
lock the engine so nobody can take off

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.850 
lock the engine so nobody can take off
or<00:01:38.670> it<00:01:38.789> can't<00:01:39.000> go<00:01:39.179> by<00:01:39.360> itself<00:01:39.619> this<00:01:40.619> is<00:01:40.830> a

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
or it can't go by itself this is a

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.699 
or it can't go by itself this is a
standard<00:01:41.460> brake<00:01:41.759> system<00:01:42.270> it's<00:01:43.229> the<00:01:43.350> exact

00:01:43.699 --> 00:01:43.709 
standard brake system it's the exact

00:01:43.709 --> 00:01:45.380 
standard brake system it's the exact
same<00:01:43.799> brake<00:01:44.220> system<00:01:44.670> that<00:01:44.850> they<00:01:44.970> use<00:01:45.000> on

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
same brake system that they use on

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.919 
same brake system that they use on
modern<00:01:45.750> day<00:01:45.780> engines<00:01:46.350> today<00:01:46.649> and<00:01:47.330> the<00:01:48.330> little

00:01:48.919 --> 00:01:48.929 
modern day engines today and the little

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:51.620 
modern day engines today and the little
brass<00:01:49.140> lever<00:01:49.470> here<00:01:49.770> is<00:01:49.950> the<00:01:50.130> reverser<00:01:50.759> that

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
brass lever here is the reverser that

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.180 
brass lever here is the reverser that
changes<00:01:52.289> the<00:01:52.619> pitch<00:01:52.860> on<00:01:53.399> the<00:01:54.590> drive<00:01:55.590> system

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:56.190 
changes the pitch on the drive system

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:00.949 
changes the pitch on the drive system
out<00:01:56.520> there<00:01:56.549> so<00:01:57.420> we<00:01:57.509> can<00:01:57.539> go<00:01:57.690> backwards<00:01:59.780> this<00:02:00.780> is

00:02:00.949 --> 00:02:00.959 
out there so we can go backwards this is

00:02:00.959 --> 00:02:02.480 
out there so we can go backwards this is
the<00:02:01.080> whistle<00:02:01.440> and<00:02:01.560> I<00:02:01.590> can<00:02:01.770> blow<00:02:01.920> that<00:02:02.100> for<00:02:02.369> you

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
the whistle and I can blow that for you

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.760 
the whistle and I can blow that for you
if<00:02:02.580> you<00:02:02.729> watch<00:02:06.170> problems<00:02:07.170> like<00:02:07.350> this<00:02:07.590> with

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
if you watch problems like this with

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:14.620 
if you watch problems like this with
both<00:02:07.950> hands

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:14.630 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:17.500 

this<00:02:15.230> is<00:02:15.380> the<00:02:15.530> brake<00:02:15.740> system<00:02:16.240> you<00:02:17.240> have<00:02:17.360> your

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
this is the brake system you have your

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.990 
this is the brake system you have your
independent<00:02:18.200> engine<00:02:18.560> brakes<00:02:18.800> and<00:02:19.610> then<00:02:19.790> your

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
independent engine brakes and then your

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.520 
independent engine brakes and then your
other<00:02:20.120> lever<00:02:20.420> is<00:02:20.660> for<00:02:20.840> your<00:02:20.960> train<00:02:21.230> brakes

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
other lever is for your train brakes

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.680 
other lever is for your train brakes
that<00:02:21.740> controls<00:02:22.160> the<00:02:22.370> brakes<00:02:22.580> on<00:02:22.970> the<00:02:23.360> rest<00:02:23.540> of

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
that controls the brakes on the rest of

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.970 
that controls the brakes on the rest of
the<00:02:23.780> train<00:02:24.070> so<00:02:25.070> you<00:02:25.100> use<00:02:25.370> those<00:02:25.610> brakes

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
the train so you use those brakes

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:34.630 
the train so you use those brakes
generally<00:02:27.980> in<00:02:28.070> combination<00:02:33.280> here<00:02:34.280> is<00:02:34.460> your

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
generally in combination here is your

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.300 
generally in combination here is your
air<00:02:34.850> pressure<00:02:35.030> gauges<00:02:35.690> that<00:02:36.680> shows<00:02:36.980> you<00:02:37.130> your

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
air pressure gauges that shows you your

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:39.160 
air pressure gauges that shows you your
main<00:02:37.520> reservoir<00:02:37.790> pressure<00:02:38.390> and<00:02:38.840> your<00:02:39.020> engine

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
main reservoir pressure and your engine

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:42.640 
main reservoir pressure and your engine
and<00:02:39.760> shows<00:02:40.760> the<00:02:41.630> pressure<00:02:41.900> on<00:02:42.230> the<00:02:42.320> rest<00:02:42.470> of

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
and shows the pressure on the rest of

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:44.740 
and shows the pressure on the rest of
the<00:02:42.770> train<00:02:43.040> the<00:02:43.550> white<00:02:43.790> one<00:02:44.060> up<00:02:44.210> there<00:02:44.450> is<00:02:44.570> your

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
the train the white one up there is your

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:49.030 
the train the white one up there is your
speedometer<00:02:46.000> you<00:02:47.000> have<00:02:47.180> a<00:02:47.210> standard<00:02:47.930> we<00:02:48.920> will

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
speedometer you have a standard we will

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.190 
speedometer you have a standard we will
open<00:02:49.580> the<00:02:49.700> lever<00:02:49.910> and<00:02:50.090> that<00:02:50.150> puts<00:02:50.600> sand<00:02:50.930> on

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
open the lever and that puts sand on

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.140 
open the lever and that puts sand on
down<00:02:51.650> in<00:02:51.950> front<00:02:52.130> of<00:02:52.280> the<00:02:52.340> wheels<00:02:52.520> on<00:02:52.820> the<00:02:52.910> track

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
down in front of the wheels on the track

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.810 
down in front of the wheels on the track
if<00:02:53.420> it's<00:02:53.600> if<00:02:53.960> it's<00:02:54.140> slippery<00:02:54.410> and<00:02:55.040> this<00:02:55.190> this

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:55.820 
if it's if it's slippery and this this

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:58.510 
if it's if it's slippery and this this
brass<00:02:56.330> lever<00:02:56.690> right<00:02:56.930> here<00:02:57.170> is<00:02:58.040> the<00:02:58.280> blowdown

00:02:58.510 --> 00:02:58.520 
brass lever right here is the blowdown

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:01.690 
brass lever right here is the blowdown
valve<00:02:59.710> basically<00:03:00.710> what<00:03:00.890> we<00:03:01.010> have<00:03:01.220> here<00:03:01.250> is<00:03:01.670> a

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 
valve basically what we have here is a

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:06.190 
valve basically what we have here is a
giant<00:03:02.060> hot<00:03:02.480> water<00:03:02.720> heater<00:03:03.050> and<00:03:04.240> we<00:03:05.240> we<00:03:05.600> boil<00:03:05.870> so

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:06.200 
giant hot water heater and we we boil so

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.610 
giant hot water heater and we we boil so
much<00:03:06.410> water<00:03:06.740> that<00:03:07.130> it<00:03:07.990> accumulates<00:03:08.990> sediment

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:09.620 
much water that it accumulates sediment

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:13.240 
much water that it accumulates sediment
and<00:03:10.490> deposits<00:03:11.240> in<00:03:11.390> the<00:03:11.510> boiler<00:03:11.950> so<00:03:12.950> what<00:03:13.130> we

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
and deposits in the boiler so what we

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:15.280 
and deposits in the boiler so what we
have<00:03:13.400> to<00:03:13.550> do<00:03:13.730> is<00:03:13.910> about<00:03:14.210> every<00:03:14.570> day<00:03:14.780> every

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
have to do is about every day every

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:17.650 
have to do is about every day every
morning<00:03:15.710> before<00:03:15.860> we<00:03:16.130> take<00:03:16.340> off<00:03:16.520> we<00:03:16.880> blow<00:03:17.630> it

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:17.660 
morning before we take off we blow it

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:19.930 
morning before we take off we blow it
down<00:03:18.140> so<00:03:18.590> we<00:03:18.680> use<00:03:18.830> the<00:03:19.040> steam<00:03:19.310> pressure<00:03:19.550> in<00:03:19.850> the

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940 
down so we use the steam pressure in the

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:22.210 
down so we use the steam pressure in the
boiler<00:03:20.120> to<00:03:20.540> boil<00:03:21.170> the<00:03:21.320> sediment<00:03:21.800> out<00:03:21.950> of<00:03:22.160> the

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220 
boiler to boil the sediment out of the

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:25.840 
boiler to boil the sediment out of the
bottom<00:03:22.850> of<00:03:22.910> the<00:03:23.000> boiler<00:03:23.360> and<00:03:24.140> that<00:03:24.320> help<00:03:24.850> makes

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:25.850 
bottom of the boiler and that help makes

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:27.460 
bottom of the boiler and that help makes
the<00:03:26.030> boiler<00:03:26.390> Ladin<00:03:26.840> last<00:03:27.050> a<00:03:27.260> lot<00:03:27.410> longer

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:27.470 
the boiler Ladin last a lot longer

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:29.230 
the boiler Ladin last a lot longer
because<00:03:27.980> you<00:03:28.190> know<00:03:28.280> if<00:03:28.400> that<00:03:28.520> sediment<00:03:28.850> stays

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:29.240 
because you know if that sediment stays

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:35.020 
because you know if that sediment stays
in<00:03:29.480> there<00:03:29.690> it<00:03:30.350> starts<00:03:32.380> aggravating<00:03:33.380> and<00:03:34.030> it's

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.030 
in there it starts aggravating and it's

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:37.720 
in there it starts aggravating and it's
not<00:03:35.210> good<00:03:35.510> for<00:03:35.540> the<00:03:35.930> the<00:03:36.860> boiler<00:03:37.190> tubes<00:03:37.430> and

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:37.730 
not good for the the boiler tubes and

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:38.950 
not good for the the boiler tubes and
everything<00:03:37.820> else<00:03:38.150> with<00:03:38.360> all<00:03:38.480> that<00:03:38.630> sediment

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:38.960 
everything else with all that sediment

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:40.630 
everything else with all that sediment
in<00:03:39.260> there<00:03:39.380> so<00:03:39.500> we<00:03:39.590> try<00:03:39.800> to<00:03:39.830> keep<00:03:40.130> it<00:03:40.250> as<00:03:40.370> clean

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:40.640 
in there so we try to keep it as clean

00:03:40.640 --> 00:05:42.129 
in there so we try to keep it as clean
as<00:03:40.850> possible

00:05:42.129 --> 00:05:42.139 

00:05:42.139 --> 00:05:53.890 

you

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:53.900 

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:55.960 

you
