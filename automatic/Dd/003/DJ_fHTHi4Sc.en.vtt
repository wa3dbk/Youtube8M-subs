00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:03.389 
hey guys sports media here with part 7

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:05.990 
hey guys sports media here with part 7
and<00:00:03.859> today<00:00:04.859> I'm<00:00:05.100> going<00:00:05.160> to<00:00:05.370> be<00:00:05.460> teaching<00:00:05.700> us

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.000 
and today I'm going to be teaching us

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.860 
and today I'm going to be teaching us
how<00:00:06.029> to<00:00:06.180> move<00:00:06.600> these<00:00:06.870> platforms<00:00:08.300> are<00:00:09.300> left<00:00:09.719> and

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
how to move these platforms are left and

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.860 
how to move these platforms are left and
right<00:00:09.990> and<00:00:10.200> stuff<00:00:11.480> so<00:00:12.480> you<00:00:12.540> can<00:00:12.719> duplicate

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
right and stuff so you can duplicate

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.189 
right and stuff so you can duplicate
this<00:00:13.380> make<00:00:14.330> second<00:00:15.330> platform<00:00:15.630> is<00:00:15.960> going<00:00:16.080> to<00:00:16.139> be

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
this make second platform is going to be

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.269 
this make second platform is going to be
moving<00:00:16.350> up<00:00:17.160> and<00:00:17.699> down<00:00:17.820> I<00:00:17.940> guess<00:00:18.680> so<00:00:19.680> don't<00:00:20.160> have

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
moving up and down I guess so don't have

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:21.710 
moving up and down I guess so don't have
two<00:00:20.430> platforms<00:00:20.640> we're<00:00:21.029> going<00:00:21.119> to<00:00:21.180> go<00:00:21.330> into<00:00:21.570> our

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
two platforms we're going to go into our

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.160 
two platforms we're going to go into our
scripts<00:00:22.279> i'm<00:00:23.279> going<00:00:23.400> to<00:00:23.460> create<00:00:23.699> a<00:00:24.170> new

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
scripts i'm going to create a new

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:35.240 
scripts i'm going to create a new
JavaScript<00:00:30.140> call<00:00:31.140> it<00:00:31.289> platform<00:00:33.110> and<00:00:34.130> it's<00:00:35.130> a

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
JavaScript call it platform and it's a

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.910 
JavaScript call it platform and it's a
sort<00:00:36.090> of<00:00:36.149> a<00:00:36.270> complicated<00:00:36.690> script<00:00:37.230> gets<00:00:37.620> to<00:00:37.800> do

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
sort of a complicated script gets to do

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:44.319 
sort of a complicated script gets to do
with<00:00:38.960> kindy<00:00:39.960> functions<00:00:40.680> so<00:00:41.640> already<00:00:43.070> found<00:00:44.070> it

00:00:44.319 --> 00:00:44.329 
with kindy functions so already found it

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:49.190 
with kindy functions so already found it
on<00:00:45.329> unify<00:00:46.640> do<00:00:47.640> a<00:00:47.670> min<00:00:47.910> description<00:00:48.420> okay

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
on unify do a min description okay

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.810 
on unify do a min description okay
actually<00:00:49.350> I<00:00:49.530> bareback<00:00:49.860> guys<00:00:50.039> give<00:00:50.670> me<00:00:50.700> a

second all right back also they said I
have<00:00:54.930> this<00:00:55.079> nice<00:00:56.000> script<00:00:57.000> for<00:00:57.239> you<00:00:57.329> guys<00:00:57.480> that

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
have this nice script for you guys that

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.959 
have this nice script for you guys that
I<00:00:58.350> found<00:00:58.770> on<00:00:58.949> ok<00:00:59.579> our<00:00:59.730> unified<00:01:00.090> community<00:01:01.969> it

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
I found on ok our unified community it

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:10.450 
I found on ok our unified community it
pretty<00:01:03.329> much<00:01:03.390> just<00:01:05.150> sets<00:01:06.150> about<00:01:06.689> how<00:01:06.840> much<00:01:08.240> x

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:10.460 
pretty much just sets about how much x

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:16.249 
pretty much just sets about how much x
steps<00:01:12.200> the<00:01:13.200> platform<00:01:13.680> is<00:01:13.950> moving<00:01:14.960> with<00:01:15.960> the

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
steps the platform is moving with the

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:22.340 
steps the platform is moving with the
speed<00:01:16.850> at<00:01:17.850> how<00:01:18.450> fast<00:01:18.780> it's<00:01:18.960> moving<00:01:19.080> and<00:01:21.229> we<00:01:22.229> are

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
speed at how fast it's moving and we are

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.780 
speed at how fast it's moving and we are
it<00:01:22.560> moves<00:01:23.000> sole<00:01:24.000> of<00:01:24.180> the<00:01:24.299> right<00:01:24.330> arm<00:01:25.790> its

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
it moves sole of the right arm its

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.480 
it moves sole of the right arm its
original<00:01:27.000> position<00:01:28.130> which<00:01:29.130> is<00:01:29.159> at<00:01:29.400> the

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
original position which is at the

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.249 
original position which is at the
beginning<00:01:29.579> of<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:30.000> game<00:01:30.150> it's<00:01:30.450> an<00:01:31.079> original

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
beginning of the game it's an original

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:37.069 
beginning of the game it's an original
position<00:01:31.799> and<00:01:33.290> while<00:01:34.290> it<00:01:34.590> is<00:01:34.770> moving<00:01:35.810> the<00:01:36.810> are

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
position and while it is moving the are

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:42.310 
position and while it is moving the are
going<00:01:37.409> to<00:01:37.770> all<00:01:39.200> transform<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.320> direction<00:01:40.619> and

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:42.320 
going to all transform the direction and

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.539 
going to all transform the direction and
um

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:45.549 

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:48.490 

either<00:01:46.549> left<00:01:46.760> or<00:01:46.880> right<00:01:47.060> and<00:01:47.240> then<00:01:48.049> we<00:01:48.200> want<00:01:48.380> to

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500 
either left or right and then we want to

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.620 
either left or right and then we want to
transform<00:01:48.799> opposition<00:01:49.490> to<00:01:50.210> our<00:01:50.240> original

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 
transform opposition to our original

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:55.210 
transform opposition to our original
position<00:01:51.280> plus<00:01:52.420> plus<00:01:53.420> how<00:01:54.110> much<00:01:54.350> we<00:01:54.920> want<00:01:55.130> to

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:55.220 
position plus plus how much we want to

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:58.359 
position plus plus how much we want to
move<00:01:55.750> so<00:01:56.750> five<00:01:57.110> steps<00:01:57.440> or<00:01:57.650> six<00:01:57.890> that's<00:01:58.159> the

00:01:58.359 --> 00:01:58.369 
move so five steps or six that's the

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:01.420 
move so five steps or six that's the
right<00:01:58.690> then<00:01:59.690> the<00:02:00.170> direction<00:02:00.619> to<00:02:00.860> removing<00:02:01.280> in

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:01.430 
right then the direction to removing in

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:05.290 
right then the direction to removing in
either<00:02:01.580> X<00:02:01.850> or<00:02:02.000> Y<00:02:02.590> and<00:02:03.590> then<00:02:04.310> pretty<00:02:04.700> much<00:02:04.790> the

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:05.300 
either X or Y and then pretty much the

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:07.149 
either X or Y and then pretty much the
speed<00:02:05.750> that<00:02:05.869> we're<00:02:06.020> moving<00:02:06.170> at<00:02:06.500> because<00:02:06.710> this

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:07.159 
speed that we're moving at because this

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:10.830 
speed that we're moving at because this
is<00:02:07.369> really<00:02:07.490> confusing<00:02:07.820> right<00:02:08.420> here<00:02:08.600> maths<00:02:09.560> in

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
is really confusing right here maths in

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:17.350 
is really confusing right here maths in
matheson<00:02:11.840> and<00:02:15.640> yeah<00:02:16.640> so<00:02:16.910> let's<00:02:17.090> look<00:02:17.209> a<00:02:17.330> little

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
matheson and yeah so let's look a little

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:22.780 
matheson and yeah so let's look a little
low<00:02:17.900> while<00:02:18.530> loop<00:02:18.769> here<00:02:18.980> so<00:02:21.580> I'm<00:02:22.580> going<00:02:22.730> to

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
low while loop here so I'm going to

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:25.630 
low while loop here so I'm going to
control<00:02:23.180> ctrl<00:02:23.690> s<00:02:23.810> to<00:02:23.840> save<00:02:23.989> and<00:02:24.470> we<00:02:25.459> should

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
control ctrl s to save and we should

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:32.259 
control ctrl s to save and we should
debug<00:02:26.000> for<00:02:26.209> errors<00:02:31.000> now<00:02:32.000> we're<00:02:32.120> going<00:02:32.209> to

00:02:32.259 --> 00:02:32.269 
debug for errors now we're going to

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:38.979 
debug for errors now we're going to
attach<00:02:32.390> it<00:02:32.690> to<00:02:32.720> a<00:02:32.810> second<00:02:33.170> platform<00:02:34.300> and<00:02:37.989> not

00:02:38.979 --> 00:02:38.989 
attach it to a second platform and not

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:40.780 
attach it to a second platform and not
just<00:02:39.170> not<00:02:39.590> to<00:02:39.739> confuse<00:02:40.010> you<00:02:40.160> guys<00:02:40.370> I'm<00:02:40.580> going

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
just not to confuse you guys I'm going

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:51.819 
just not to confuse you guys I'm going
to<00:02:42.459> scroll<00:02:43.459> clear<00:02:43.819> play<00:02:44.060> or<00:02:44.330> place<00:02:47.890> on<00:02:50.829> this

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:51.829 
to scroll clear play or place on this

00:02:51.829 --> 00:03:11.220 
to scroll clear play or place on this
speed<00:02:54.760> that<00:02:55.760> way<00:02:56.000> you<00:02:56.660> actually<00:02:56.840> understand

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:21.949 

oh<00:03:12.900> now<00:03:13.900> that<00:03:14.050> not<00:03:14.230> feel<00:03:14.560> like<00:03:14.980> I'm<00:03:15.220> in<00:03:15.340> a<00:03:20.849> needy

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
oh now that not feel like I'm in a needy

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:33.140 
oh now that not feel like I'm in a needy
steps<00:03:22.959> not<00:03:23.349> speed<00:03:23.680> steps<00:03:25.739> that<00:03:26.739> is<00:03:26.980> my<00:03:27.940> fault

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:38.970 

that<00:03:34.920> steps<00:03:35.920> not<00:03:36.160> speed<00:03:37.379> any<00:03:38.379> steps<00:03:38.769> on<00:03:38.920> your

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:38.980 
that steps not speed any steps on your

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:50.059 
that steps not speed any steps on your
move<00:03:40.709> all<00:03:41.709> right<00:03:42.629> so<00:03:43.629> we<00:03:43.690> can<00:03:43.840> move<00:03:48.030> 5.5<00:03:49.030> and
