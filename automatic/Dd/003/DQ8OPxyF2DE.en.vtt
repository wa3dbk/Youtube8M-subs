00:00:57.859 --> 00:01:03.450
 do not chew 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:08.030
 the performance of Kaskol on teeth 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:10.950
 makes me father and I will understand to be a great 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:13.590
 baggage bag 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:18.810
 beyond the ground and is not so much in the 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:22.610
 history has known its champion can have 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.610
 less taste of salt 26 hours 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:35.900

 Batman in his current champion button

 It's not right to keep hands. 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:14.340

 he is a very bunny ok so now 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:27.090
 We are going to talk about some easter eggs. 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:29.250
 and theories you have about this trailer 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.560
 The first theory is that this general who 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.330
 send the time is chatting throughout 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.610
 that discourse of supervillains that she 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:38.580
 got it and so on 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.480
 can be a DC villain known as the 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.090
 general 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:44.370
 his name is ei cast the croque that is 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.860
 a batman villain is being taken away from 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.600
 one side to the other exactly the same rene 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.700
 brat in the movie the silence of the 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:52.500
 innocent during this week that the 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:55.110
 amendment time of all that speech 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:57.060
 of the river is the bad guy I am the owner and 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:58.920
 Chess is have we saw a scene 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.170
 There's a girl exploring a cave. 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.940
 This girl is probably villain in 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:05.340
 cantorias that is part of the squadron 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:07.710
 suicidal she gains her powers after 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:09.810
 find a demon in this cave 

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:12.240
 this first scene of shootings in the 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:14.670
 trailer probably the joker team 

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:17.880
 invading arkham asylum or for taking 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:20.070
 There or to put there is the first 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:23.280
 appearance of the joker in this trailer in 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:24.750
 not this final apparition it appears 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.630
 walking and calming down somewhere 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:28.260
 in the middle of the trailer but easter eggs here 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:29.489
 O 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.290
 You are seeing this affection here. 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:33.690
 shooting with a goat mask because it is 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:35.459
 he is a reference series gotham in a 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:37.380
 gotham episode that talks about a 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:39.600
 vengeful spirit that goes from being 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:40.260
 generation called the spirit of the 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.360
 goat 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:45.330
 the spirit of the goat perform acts 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:47.070
 violent sacrifices and has the habit of 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:49.019
 wear a goat mask 

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:50.550
 in this scene that Batman is chasing 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:52.260
 a car that is the first time the 

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:54.720
 people see wrong and speak during the 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:56.010
 trailer who is driving this car is 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.660
 the joker himself 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:00.030
 but we still do not know if it's going to be 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:02.130
 a scene itself or if it is going to be 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:04.350
 just a flashback but more likely 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:06.209
 will be a flashback and now bigger 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:08.070
 The theory about this trailer is that people 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:10.440
 will see origin of the radio include in the movie 

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:12.720
 but they will modify their origin a little 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:14.820
 while in the rally comics wedge a 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:17.190
 psychiatrist trying to cure the joker 

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:19.320
 try to understand that crazy head 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:21.510
 him and the joker for being more 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:23.970
 intelligent that she ends up doing it herself 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:26.340
 falls in love with him and turns her into a 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:28.590
 crazy of stone that neither he even doing 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:29.660
 she help him get away and leave the 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:31.790
 movie 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:33.680
 likely to be tortured by the 

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:35.660
 This theory can be psychic. 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:37.760
 because in this scene you see the 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:39.380
 joker going to do something with her 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:41.810
 While she 's crying we see the 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:43.940
 Joker with Causes They Say 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:46.340
 He's probably on the cell phone. 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:50.090
 People see a guy dressed as a panda. 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:51.920
 armed and some scenes before we saw 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:54.380
 a shooting and a patient crying 

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:57.410
 during the shooting and the phrase of corinthinha 

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:59.390
 happens in the same scene that it enters or 

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:01.880
 either he'll probably say that to 

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:03.560
 laugh while going to torture her 

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:05.780
