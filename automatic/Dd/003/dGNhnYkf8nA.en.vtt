get<00:04:18.260> on<00:04:18.409> that<00:04:18.560> side<00:04:18.799> then<00:04:18.859> it<00:04:19.070> flows<00:04:19.370> this<00:04:19.669> way

00:04:19.719 --> 00:04:19.729 
get on that side then it flows this way

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:21.530 
so don't want to keep it on that side

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:23.430 
so don't want to keep it on that side
either<00:04:21.680> so<00:04:22.400> yeah<00:04:22.610> just<00:04:22.849> keep

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:28.290 
on this corner and do that on both sides

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:31.290 
on this corner and do that on both sides
so<00:04:29.290> it'll<00:04:29.530> end<00:04:29.680> up<00:04:29.770> with<00:04:29.950> like<00:04:30.100> this<00:04:30.310> and<00:04:30.610> then

I'll tell you how it does anything okay
so<00:04:59.590> what<00:04:59.830> happens<00:05:00.220> is<00:05:00.460> um<00:05:01.170> this<00:05:02.170> these<00:05:02.620> fence

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:02.860 
so what happens is um this these fence

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:04.680 
so what happens is um this these fence
posts<00:05:03.160> are<00:05:03.250> considered<00:05:03.700> a<00:05:03.790> block<00:05:04.060> the<00:05:04.450> fence

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:04.690 
posts are considered a block the fence

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:07.590 
posts are considered a block the fence
post<00:05:05.010> so<00:05:06.010> but<00:05:06.550> what<00:05:06.760> happens<00:05:06.790> is<00:05:07.240> sort<00:05:07.540> of

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:07.600 
post so but what happens is sort of

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:09.960 
post so but what happens is sort of
tricks<00:05:07.960> the<00:05:08.170> cactuses<00:05:08.740> into<00:05:09.100> growing<00:05:09.370> anyways

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:09.970 
tricks the cactuses into growing anyways

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:12.240 
tricks the cactuses into growing anyways
so<00:05:10.810> they<00:05:10.990> grow<00:05:11.140> the<00:05:11.290> second<00:05:11.590> bug<00:05:11.710> once<00:05:11.950> a<00:05:12.040> third

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:12.250 
so they grow the second bug once a third

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:14.460 
so they grow the second bug once a third
block<00:05:12.550> is<00:05:13.150> growing<00:05:13.540> on<00:05:13.600> top<00:05:13.840> of<00:05:14.020> the<00:05:14.080> second

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:14.470 
block is growing on top of the second

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:17.630 
block is growing on top of the second
cacti<00:05:14.920> um<00:05:15.220> it's<00:05:16.030> sort<00:05:16.210> of<00:05:16.300> like<00:05:16.390> updates<00:05:16.930> the

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:17.640 
cacti um it's sort of like updates the

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:20.070 
cacti um it's sort of like updates the
the<00:05:18.640> block<00:05:18.850> under<00:05:19.090> it<00:05:19.270> to<00:05:19.540> tell<00:05:19.720> that<00:05:19.930> there's

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:20.080 
the block under it to tell that there's

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:22.020 
the block under it to tell that there's
a<00:05:20.170> block<00:05:20.440> right<00:05:21.190> next<00:05:21.490> to<00:05:21.580> you<00:05:21.670> so<00:05:21.820> you

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:22.030 
a block right next to you so you

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:24.540 
a block right next to you so you
shouldn't<00:05:22.270> have<00:05:22.390> grown<00:05:22.690> and<00:05:23.220> it<00:05:24.220> makes<00:05:24.400> it

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:24.550 
shouldn't have grown and it makes it

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:27.540 
shouldn't have grown and it makes it
break<00:05:24.820> itself<00:05:25.210> so<00:05:25.750> yeah<00:05:26.560> and<00:05:26.830> then<00:05:27.250> it<00:05:27.340> breaks

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:27.550 
break itself so yeah and then it breaks

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:28.620 
break itself so yeah and then it breaks
and<00:05:27.820> then<00:05:27.880> it<00:05:28.030> falls<00:05:28.240> into<00:05:28.419> the<00:05:28.600> water

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:28.630 
and then it falls into the water

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:31.500 
and then it falls into the water
hopefully<00:05:29.169> and<00:05:29.760> you<00:05:30.760> got<00:05:30.940> yourself<00:05:31.090> some

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:31.510 
hopefully and you got yourself some

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:33.150 
hopefully and you got yourself some
cactus<00:05:31.960> but<00:05:32.260> the<00:05:32.350> problem<00:05:32.560> with<00:05:32.740> the<00:05:32.830> cactus

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:33.160 
cactus but the problem with the cactus

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:34.680 
cactus but the problem with the cactus
is<00:05:33.220> it<00:05:33.310> does<00:05:33.460> take<00:05:33.610> a<00:05:33.640> long<00:05:33.850> time<00:05:34.060> to<00:05:34.120> grow<00:05:34.450> and

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:34.690 
is it does take a long time to grow and

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:36.570 
is it does take a long time to grow and
but<00:05:35.500> one<00:05:35.650> great<00:05:35.890> thing<00:05:35.919> about<00:05:36.160> these<00:05:36.400> these

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:36.580 
but one great thing about these these

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:39.990 
but one great thing about these these
are<00:05:36.640> stackable<00:05:37.240> um<00:05:37.630> I<00:05:38.560> don't<00:05:39.550> think<00:05:39.700> you<00:05:39.850> guys

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:40.000 
are stackable um I don't think you guys

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.909 
are stackable um I don't think you guys
really<00:05:40.180> need<00:05:40.390> or<00:05:40.870> own<00:05:41.020> house<00:05:41.230> stockholm<00:05:41.800> you

00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:41.919 
really need or own house stockholm you

00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:43.740 
really need or own house stockholm you
just<00:05:42.100> build<00:05:42.280> the<00:05:42.400> same<00:05:42.580> exact<00:05:43.000> concept<00:05:43.510> but<00:05:43.630> on

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:43.750 
just build the same exact concept but on

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:47.490 
just build the same exact concept but on
top<00:05:43.960> of<00:05:44.020> each<00:05:44.260> other<00:05:45.240> and<00:05:46.240> it<00:05:46.750> should<00:05:47.140> work

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:47.500 
top of each other and it should work

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:52.230 
top of each other and it should work
just<00:05:47.919> fine<00:05:49.500> one<00:05:50.500> problem<00:05:50.950> I<00:05:51.220> do<00:05:51.280> not<00:05:51.580> like<00:05:51.820> when

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:52.240 
just fine one problem I do not like when

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:55.830 
just fine one problem I do not like when
you<00:05:52.390> stack<00:05:52.720> them<00:05:52.900> is<00:05:53.940> these<00:05:54.940> four<00:05:55.360> blocks

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:55.840 
you stack them is these four blocks

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:58.230 
you stack them is these four blocks
these<00:05:56.350> ones<00:05:56.620> you<00:05:57.370> know<00:05:57.430> these<00:05:57.850> ones<00:05:58.120> right

00:05:58.230 --> 00:05:58.240 
these ones you know these ones right

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:00.990 
these ones you know these ones right
here<00:05:58.360> the<00:05:59.200> first<00:05:59.620> cactus<00:06:00.280> they<00:06:00.460> get<00:06:00.580> stuck<00:06:00.820> on

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:01.000 
here the first cactus they get stuck on

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.500 
here the first cactus they get stuck on
that<00:06:01.180> so<00:06:01.870> one<00:06:02.110> thing<00:06:02.290> I<00:06:02.530> did<00:06:02.890> was<00:06:03.270> oh<00:06:04.270> yeah<00:06:04.480> I

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:04.510 
that so one thing I did was oh yeah I

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:07.860 
that so one thing I did was oh yeah I
broke<00:06:04.690> out<00:06:05.110> these<00:06:05.970> so<00:06:06.970> I<00:06:07.000> made<00:06:07.240> it<00:06:07.419> so<00:06:07.600> it<00:06:07.840> can

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:07.870 
broke out these so I made it so it can

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:12.030 
broke out these so I made it so it can
come<00:06:08.110> out<00:06:08.169> of<00:06:08.230> both<00:06:08.440> sides<00:06:10.290> yeah<00:06:11.290> let<00:06:11.830> me<00:06:12.010> just

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:12.040 
come out of both sides yeah let me just

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:15.270 
come out of both sides yeah let me just
drop<00:06:12.400> down<00:06:12.640> okay<00:06:13.210> so<00:06:13.360> yeah<00:06:13.540> this<00:06:14.500> is<00:06:14.770> not

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:15.280 
drop down okay so yeah this is not

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:17.100 
drop down okay so yeah this is not
really<00:06:15.460> needed<00:06:15.820> for<00:06:16.090> if<00:06:16.330> you<00:06:16.450> only<00:06:16.630> have<00:06:16.870> one

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:17.110 
really needed for if you only have one

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:19.440 
really needed for if you only have one
higher<00:06:17.410> but<00:06:17.740> if<00:06:17.770> you<00:06:18.040> if<00:06:18.640> you<00:06:18.790> have<00:06:18.970> a<00:06:19.000> second

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:19.450 
higher but if you if you have a second

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:21.690 
higher but if you if you have a second
layer<00:06:19.570> then<00:06:20.200> this<00:06:20.500> is<00:06:20.680> really<00:06:21.130> advisable

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:21.700 
layer then this is really advisable

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:25.230 
layer then this is really advisable
that's<00:06:22.030> what<00:06:22.180> I<00:06:22.270> did<00:06:23.190> and<00:06:24.190> I<00:06:24.340> on<00:06:24.730> the<00:06:24.850> top<00:06:25.060> layer

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:25.240 
that's what I did and I on the top layer

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:26.880 
that's what I did and I on the top layer
I<00:06:25.300> let<00:06:25.540> the<00:06:25.660> water<00:06:25.840> flow<00:06:25.930> through<00:06:26.410> here<00:06:26.680> too

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:26.890 
I let the water flow through here too

00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:31.560 
I let the water flow through here too
and<00:06:27.160> I<00:06:27.760> made<00:06:28.000> an<00:06:28.210> extra<00:06:28.720> opening<00:06:29.400> on<00:06:30.400> to<00:06:31.360> where

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:31.570 
and I made an extra opening on to where

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:34.409 
and I made an extra opening on to where
it<00:06:31.900> can<00:06:32.289> flow<00:06:32.680> through<00:06:32.710> I'll<00:06:33.640> show<00:06:34.060> I'll<00:06:34.240> you

was<00:06:48.470> I<00:06:48.710> have<00:06:48.950> it<00:06:49.130> stack<00:06:49.400> I'm<00:06:49.670> actually<00:06:49.970> later

00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:50.300 
was I have it stack I'm actually later

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:52.030 
was I have it stack I'm actually later
on<00:06:50.420> I'm<00:06:50.510> going<00:06:50.540> to<00:06:50.690> stack<00:06:50.870> even<00:06:51.230> higher<00:06:51.410> more

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:52.040 
on I'm going to stack even higher more

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:54.400 
on I'm going to stack even higher more
but<00:06:52.970> let's<00:06:53.090> see<00:06:53.240> I<00:06:53.300> made<00:06:53.510> two<00:06:53.810> more<00:06:54.020> than<00:06:54.200> one

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:54.410 
but let's see I made two more than one

00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:56.170 
but let's see I made two more than one
opening<00:06:54.860> for<00:06:55.130> the<00:06:55.190> water<00:06:55.430> to<00:06:55.520> flow<00:06:55.790> but<00:06:56.000> then

00:06:56.170 --> 00:06:56.180 
opening for the water to flow but then

00:06:56.180 --> 00:07:00.640 
opening for the water to flow but then
like<00:06:56.360> up<00:06:57.110> here<00:06:57.280> i<00:06:58.750> also<00:06:59.750> broke<00:07:00.110> out<00:07:00.320> a<00:07:00.350> full

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:00.650 
like up here i also broke out a full

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:02.350 
like up here i also broke out a full
right<00:07:00.860> here<00:07:01.190> so<00:07:01.400> that<00:07:01.580> if<00:07:01.670> the<00:07:01.790> water<00:07:01.970> comes<00:07:02.270> to

00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:02.360 
right here so that if the water comes to

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:05.830 
right here so that if the water comes to
this<00:07:02.660> side<00:07:03.100> it'll<00:07:04.100> just<00:07:04.130> flow<00:07:04.550> down<00:07:04.790> and<00:07:05.150> open

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:05.840 
this side it'll just flow down and open

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:09.940 
this side it'll just flow down and open
to<00:07:06.020> the<00:07:06.080> side<00:07:06.380> and<00:07:07.280> this<00:07:07.940> this<00:07:08.240> helps<00:07:08.660> and<00:07:08.960> so

00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:09.950 
to the side and this this helps and so

00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:14.560 
to the side and this this helps and so
it<00:07:10.070> won't<00:07:10.250> get<00:07:10.460> as<00:07:11.180> much<00:07:12.430> if<00:07:13.430> that<00:07:14.000> may<00:07:14.120> tend<00:07:14.450> to

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:14.570 
it won't get as much if that may tend to

00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:16.540 
it won't get as much if that may tend to
it<00:07:14.630> yeah<00:07:14.780> sometimes<00:07:15.410> not<00:07:15.650> only<00:07:15.860> jam<00:07:16.130> like<00:07:16.340> it

00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:16.550 
it yeah sometimes not only jam like it

00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:18.460 
it yeah sometimes not only jam like it
just<00:07:16.730> went<00:07:16.910> the<00:07:17.120> cactus<00:07:17.660> will<00:07:17.840> just<00:07:18.050> get<00:07:18.170> stuck

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:18.470 
just went the cactus will just get stuck

00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:20.710 
just went the cactus will just get stuck
in<00:07:18.590> the<00:07:18.650> middle<00:07:18.770> block<00:07:19.100> and<00:07:19.400> it<00:07:20.330> won't<00:07:20.510> go

00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:20.720 
in the middle block and it won't go

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:23.350 
in the middle block and it won't go
anywhere<00:07:20.990> so<00:07:21.320> I<00:07:21.350> did<00:07:21.590> that<00:07:21.800> to<00:07:22.550> stop<00:07:23.000> that<00:07:23.300> from

00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:23.360 
anywhere so I did that to stop that from

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:25.510 
anywhere so I did that to stop that from
happening<00:07:23.660> it<00:07:24.590> doesn't<00:07:24.830> only<00:07:24.950> happen<00:07:25.190> much

00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:25.520 
happening it doesn't only happen much

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:27.610 
happening it doesn't only happen much

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:27.620 
unless this one breaks this one's only

unless this one breaks this one's only
one<00:07:27.770> that<00:07:27.890> does<00:07:28.040> that<00:07:30.310> so<00:07:31.310> yeah<00:07:31.580> if<00:07:31.940> you<00:07:32.090> like
