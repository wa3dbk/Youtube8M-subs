of drills before you start actual game
situation<00:00:54.750> drills<00:00:55.079> so<00:00:55.829> we<00:00:55.949> talked<00:00:56.160> about

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
situation drills so we talked about

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.639 
situation drills so we talked about
pre-practice<00:00:56.969> fundamentals<00:00:57.750> really<00:00:58.440> just

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
pre-practice fundamentals really just

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.130 
pre-practice fundamentals really just
emphasizing<00:00:59.340> the<00:00:59.430> fundamentals<00:01:00.000> of<00:01:00.140> fielding

and<00:01:01.350> throwing<00:01:01.949> the<00:01:02.039> ball<00:01:02.090> the<00:01:03.090> progression<00:01:03.660> to

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
and throwing the ball the progression to

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.080 
and throwing the ball the progression to
that<00:01:03.930> is<00:01:04.110> then<00:01:04.290> to<00:01:04.500> do<00:01:04.710> ground<00:01:05.400> ball<00:01:05.610> series

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
that is then to do ground ball series

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.730 
that is then to do ground ball series
which<00:01:06.420> is<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:06.600> ground<00:01:06.930> ball<00:01:07.110> right<00:01:07.350> at<00:01:07.409> you

the<00:02:02.189> year<00:02:02.430> I<00:02:02.869> constantly<00:02:03.869> get<00:02:04.229> the<00:02:04.380> question

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
the year I constantly get the question

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:06.950 
the year I constantly get the question
how<00:02:05.460> many<00:02:05.520> balls<00:02:06.149> are<00:02:06.479> we<00:02:06.659> going<00:02:06.810> to<00:02:06.869> be

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
how many balls are we going to be

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.809 
how many balls are we going to be
fielding<00:02:07.500> at<00:02:07.649> one<00:02:07.979> point<00:02:08.220> during<00:02:08.459> the<00:02:08.580> season

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
fielding at one point during the season

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.089 
fielding at one point during the season
it's<00:02:09.209> a<00:02:09.270> very<00:02:09.509> simple<00:02:09.780> formula<00:02:10.229> that<00:02:10.679> we<00:02:10.830> use

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
it's a very simple formula that we use

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.890 
it's a very simple formula that we use
in<00:02:11.370> the<00:02:12.180> off<00:02:12.360> season<00:02:12.629> or<00:02:12.900> preseason<00:02:13.500> if<00:02:13.709> you

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
in the off season or preseason if you

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.289 
in the off season or preseason if you
pre-seasoned<00:02:14.650> you<00:02:15.010> have<00:02:15.129> a<00:02:15.159> high<00:02:15.489> volume<00:02:15.549> of

00:02:16.289 --> 00:02:16.299 
pre-seasoned you have a high volume of

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:18.990 
pre-seasoned you have a high volume of
individual<00:02:16.930> drills<00:02:17.200> as<00:02:17.530> you<00:02:18.250> get<00:02:18.459> closer<00:02:18.819> to

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
individual drills as you get closer to

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.470 
individual drills as you get closer to
the<00:02:19.239> season<00:02:19.780> you<00:02:20.769> shorten<00:02:21.370> up<00:02:21.489> the<00:02:21.970> individual

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
the season you shorten up the individual

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.050 
the season you shorten up the individual
drills<00:02:22.720> and<00:02:22.989> you<00:02:23.620> put<00:02:23.920> a<00:02:23.950> larger<00:02:24.640> number<00:02:24.670> of

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
drills and you put a larger number of

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:26.940 
drills and you put a larger number of
game<00:02:25.360> situation<00:02:26.049> drills<00:02:26.319> because<00:02:26.530> now<00:02:26.890> the

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
game situation drills because now the

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.030 
game situation drills because now the
team<00:02:27.280> has<00:02:27.310> to<00:02:27.760> get<00:02:27.879> used<00:02:28.090> to<00:02:28.239> working<00:02:28.360> together

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
team has to get used to working together

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.160 
team has to get used to working together
but<00:02:30.040> it<00:02:30.189> doesn't<00:02:30.519> matter<00:02:30.790> if<00:02:31.150> your<00:02:31.750> team<00:02:31.989> can

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
but it doesn't matter if your team can

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.259 
but it doesn't matter if your team can
work<00:02:32.349> together<00:02:32.530> if<00:02:32.950> each<00:02:33.489> individual<00:02:34.060> player

00:02:34.259 --> 00:02:34.269 
work together if each individual player

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:36.449 
work together if each individual player
can't<00:02:34.659> pick<00:02:34.870> it<00:02:34.900> up<00:02:35.079> and<00:02:35.290> throw<00:02:35.500> a<00:02:35.590> strike<00:02:35.980> to

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:36.459 
can't pick it up and throw a strike to

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:38.399 
can't pick it up and throw a strike to
their<00:02:36.609> intended<00:02:36.909> target<00:02:37.450> so<00:02:37.900> that's<00:02:38.109> why<00:02:38.260> we

00:02:38.399 --> 00:02:38.409 
their intended target so that's why we

00:02:38.409 --> 00:02:40.800 
their intended target so that's why we
spend<00:02:38.650> a<00:02:38.709> lot<00:02:38.739> of<00:02:38.920> time<00:02:39.220> on<00:02:39.489> individual<00:02:40.239> drill

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
spend a lot of time on individual drill

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.220 
spend a lot of time on individual drill
work<00:02:40.989> so<00:02:41.680> the<00:02:41.799> progression<00:02:42.310> is<00:02:42.400> individual

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
work so the progression is individual

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.479 
work so the progression is individual
