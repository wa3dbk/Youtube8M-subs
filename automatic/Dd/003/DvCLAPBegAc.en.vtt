00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:11.590 

uh

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:11.600 
uh

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:15.129 
uh
frankly<00:00:12.140> I<00:00:12.230> don't<00:00:12.290> think<00:00:12.650> so

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:15.139 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:20.679 

his<00:00:16.139> rivals<00:00:16.680> are<00:00:17.119> younger<00:00:18.119> a<00:00:18.449> lot<00:00:19.260> younger<00:00:19.439> and

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:20.689 
his rivals are younger a lot younger and

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:24.140 
his rivals are younger a lot younger and
especially<00:00:21.689> Contador<00:00:22.320> is<00:00:22.349> as<00:00:23.130> far<00:00:23.340> as<00:00:23.490> I<00:00:23.610> can

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
especially Contador is as far as I can

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.580 
especially Contador is as far as I can
see<00:00:24.210> it<00:00:24.509> is<00:00:24.630> an<00:00:24.779> exceptional<00:00:25.349> rider<00:00:27.590> is

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
see it is an exceptional rider is

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.589 
see it is an exceptional rider is
absolutely<00:00:29.340> the<00:00:29.460> best<00:00:29.610> I<00:00:29.820> mean<00:00:29.849> last<00:00:30.240> year<00:00:30.509> he

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
absolutely the best I mean last year he

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.470 
absolutely the best I mean last year he
won<00:00:30.779> the<00:00:30.869> Tour<00:00:31.050> de<00:00:31.169> France<00:00:31.439> although<00:00:31.739> the<00:00:32.480> tour

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
won the Tour de France although the tour

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.020 
won the Tour de France although the tour
wasn't<00:00:33.750> that<00:00:34.079> hard<00:00:34.410> I<00:00:34.739> mean<00:00:35.489> this<00:00:35.670> year<00:00:35.880> will

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
wasn't that hard I mean this year will

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.479 
wasn't that hard I mean this year will
be<00:00:36.180> a<00:00:36.210> harder<00:00:36.750> raised<00:00:36.960> in<00:00:37.200> terms<00:00:37.950> of<00:00:38.130> climbs

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
be a harder raised in terms of climbs

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.950 
be a harder raised in terms of climbs
and<00:00:38.760> so<00:00:38.940> on<00:00:39.120> and<00:00:40.219> that's<00:00:41.219> why<00:00:41.399> I<00:00:41.430> think<00:00:41.579> that

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:41.960 
and so on and that's why I think that

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.979 
and so on and that's why I think that
Lance<00:00:43.579> doesn't<00:00:44.579> have<00:00:44.850> a<00:00:44.879> chance<00:00:45.420> to<00:00:45.690> win<00:00:45.719> the

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
Lance doesn't have a chance to win the

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.529 
Lance doesn't have a chance to win the
Tour<00:00:46.170> there's<00:00:46.500> one<00:00:47.190> possibility<00:00:47.399> well<00:00:48.300> not

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
Tour there's one possibility well not

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.180 
Tour there's one possibility well not
just<00:00:48.600> one<00:00:48.989> possibility<00:00:49.379> of<00:00:49.620> course<00:00:49.920> but<00:00:50.070> you

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
just one possibility of course but you

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.090 
just one possibility of course but you
have<00:00:50.339> that<00:00:50.550> a<00:00:51.109> few<00:00:52.109> tricky<00:00:52.469> stages<00:00:52.890> in<00:00:53.039> the

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
have that a few tricky stages in the

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.770 
have that a few tricky stages in the
beginning<00:00:53.489> of<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:53.699> tour<00:00:53.909> where<00:00:54.239> you<00:00:54.480> can't

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
beginning of the tour where you can't

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.270 
beginning of the tour where you can't
win<00:00:55.019> the<00:00:55.170> tour<00:00:55.350> but<00:00:55.530> you<00:00:55.620> can<00:00:55.769> lose<00:00:55.980> it<00:00:56.190> and

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
win the tour but you can lose it and

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.700 
win the tour but you can lose it and
also<00:00:56.429> Contador<00:00:57.120> can<00:00:57.300> lose<00:00:57.449> it<00:00:57.600> over<00:00:57.780> there<00:00:58.109> so

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
also Contador can lose it over there so

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.279 
also Contador can lose it over there so
I'm<00:00:59.489> referring<00:00:59.879> to<00:00:59.999> the<00:01:00.179> Kabul<00:01:00.510> the<00:01:00.989> Kabul

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
I'm referring to the Kabul the Kabul

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.950 
I'm referring to the Kabul the Kabul
stage<00:01:01.609> which<00:01:02.609> could<00:01:02.850> become<00:01:02.999> very<00:01:03.359> tricky<00:01:03.749> for

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
stage which could become very tricky for

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.440 
stage which could become very tricky for
our<00:01:04.080> best<00:01:04.320> Oh<00:01:04.500> Lance<00:01:05.339> has<00:01:05.550> a<00:01:05.580> better<00:01:05.820> team<00:01:06.180> to

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
our best Oh Lance has a better team to

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.190 
our best Oh Lance has a better team to
to<00:01:06.870> go<00:01:07.020> over<00:01:07.290> the<00:01:07.380> cobbles<00:01:07.770> and<00:01:08.810> that<00:01:09.810> could<00:01:10.050> be

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
to go over the cobbles and that could be

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.700 
to go over the cobbles and that could be
a<00:01:10.229> possibility<00:01:10.650> for<00:01:11.430> him<00:01:11.610> to<00:01:11.790> win<00:01:12.000> it<00:01:12.150> but

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:12.710 
a possibility for him to win it but

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.010 
a possibility for him to win it but
fairly<00:01:13.710> I<00:01:14.010> don't<00:01:14.310> think<00:01:14.550> so<00:01:14.760> I<00:01:14.790> mean<00:01:14.880> I<00:01:15.090> in<00:01:15.840> my

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
fairly I don't think so I mean I in my

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.620 
fairly I don't think so I mean I in my
opinion<00:01:16.409> it<00:01:16.710> will<00:01:17.070> be<00:01:17.250> Contador<00:01:17.760> who<00:01:17.909> wins<00:01:18.479> the

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
opinion it will be Contador who wins the

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.830 
opinion it will be Contador who wins the
Tour<00:01:18.810> de<00:01:18.900> France

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.319 

I<00:01:22.340> think<00:01:23.340> you'll<00:01:23.460> give<00:01:23.609> it<00:01:23.700> a<00:01:23.759> pretty<00:01:23.939> good<00:01:24.030> go

00:01:24.319 --> 00:01:24.329 
I think you'll give it a pretty good go

00:01:24.329 --> 00:01:26.870 
I think you'll give it a pretty good go
but<00:01:24.689> i<00:01:24.719> also<00:01:24.990> think<00:01:25.140> if<00:01:25.530> Team<00:01:25.740> Sky<00:01:26.100> arrived<00:01:26.759> in

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
but i also think if Team Sky arrived in

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.910 
but i also think if Team Sky arrived in
the<00:01:26.969> tour<00:01:27.210> that<00:01:27.810> they'll<00:01:27.960> give<00:01:28.170> him<00:01:28.289> a<00:01:28.439> hard

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
the tour that they'll give him a hard

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.190 
the tour that they'll give him a hard
ride

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.380 

I<00:01:31.460> think<00:01:32.460> he<00:01:32.579> can<00:01:32.820> I<00:01:33.560> will<00:01:34.560> follow<00:01:34.880> Obama<00:01:35.880> yes

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
I think he can I will follow Obama yes

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.999 
I think he can I will follow Obama yes
he<00:01:36.600> can<00:01:37.700> why<00:01:38.840> because<00:01:39.840> he's<00:01:40.530> a<00:01:40.560> very

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
he can why because he's a very

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.969 
he can why because he's a very
experienced<00:01:41.780> experienced<00:01:42.780> rider<00:01:43.049> very

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
experienced experienced rider very

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.830 
experienced experienced rider very
strong<00:01:44.340> better<00:01:44.729> than<00:01:44.939> last<00:01:45.119> year<00:01:45.479> and<00:01:45.740> I<00:01:47.840> first

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
strong better than last year and I first

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.109 
strong better than last year and I first
of<00:01:48.960> all<00:01:49.020> I<00:01:49.079> doubt<00:01:49.439> about<00:01:49.679> the<00:01:49.920> team<00:01:50.130> of<00:01:50.340> Alberto

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
of all I doubt about the team of Alberto

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:55.100 
of all I doubt about the team of Alberto
Contador<00:01:51.689> and<00:01:52.789> the<00:01:53.789> man<00:01:54.000> behind<00:01:54.210> the<00:01:54.630> real<00:01:54.929> in

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
Contador and the man behind the real in

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.800 
Contador and the man behind the real in
the<00:01:55.200> car<00:01:55.439> because<00:01:56.189> last<00:01:56.460> year<00:01:56.850> there<00:01:57.539> was<00:01:57.659> you

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
the car because last year there was you

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.649 
the car because last year there was you
on<00:01:57.960> Brunell<00:01:58.350> a<00:01:58.530> very<00:01:58.920> small<00:01:59.189> tactical

00:01:59.649 --> 00:01:59.659

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:29.559 
Olympics box everything else fell off
but<00:02:27.530> he<00:02:27.890> he's<00:02:28.670> getting<00:02:28.940> old<00:02:29.180> and<00:02:29.240> those<00:02:29.390> young

00:02:29.559 --> 00:02:29.569 
but he he's getting old and those young

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:32.559 
but he he's getting old and those young
guys<00:02:29.750> getting<00:02:30.110> younger<00:02:30.410> I<00:02:31.390> don't<00:02:32.390> think<00:02:32.510> he

00:02:32.559 --> 00:02:32.569 
guys getting younger I don't think he

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:36.050 
guys getting younger I don't think he
can<00:02:32.690> win<00:02:32.720> it

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.200 

I<00:02:37.260> think<00:02:38.260> Lance<00:02:38.800> Armstrong<00:02:39.400> may<00:02:39.910> struggle

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:40.210 
I think Lance Armstrong may struggle

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:43.170 
I think Lance Armstrong may struggle
this<00:02:40.510> year<00:02:40.720> he<00:02:40.870> may<00:02:41.260> be<00:02:41.400> just<00:02:42.400> a<00:02:42.730> year<00:02:42.880> or<00:02:42.940> two

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
this year he may be just a year or two

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.900 
this year he may be just a year or two
to<00:02:43.420> old<00:02:43.630> and<00:02:43.900> I<00:02:44.800> also<00:02:45.160> think<00:02:45.400> the<00:02:45.550> other<00:02:45.670> teams

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
to old and I also think the other teams

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:52.250 
to old and I also think the other teams
will<00:02:46.210> will<00:02:47.400> be<00:02:48.400> too<00:02:48.820> strong<00:02:49.150> for<00:02:49.330> his<00:02:49.450> new<00:02:49.960> team

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.890 

I<00:02:52.640> definitely<00:02:53.640> think<00:02:53.939> he<00:02:54.090> can<00:02:54.330> I<00:02:54.360> think<00:02:54.750> he'll

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
I definitely think he can I think he'll

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.479 
I definitely think he can I think he'll
be<00:02:55.049> much<00:02:55.290> stronger<00:02:55.590> this<00:02:55.830> year<00:02:55.890> than<00:02:56.459> last

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489 
be much stronger this year than last

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:58.520 
be much stronger this year than last
year<00:02:56.849> even<00:02:57.329> though<00:02:57.450> he'll<00:02:57.659> be<00:02:57.780> one<00:02:57.959> year<00:02:58.170> older

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
year even though he'll be one year older

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.740 
year even though he'll be one year older
he'll<00:02:59.189> be<00:02:59.340> wiser<00:02:59.610> for<00:02:59.849> what<00:03:00.269> he<00:03:00.360> learned<00:03:00.629> an

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
he'll be wiser for what he learned an

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:03.319 
he'll be wiser for what he learned an
experienced<00:03:01.409> last<00:03:01.680> season<00:03:02.189> he<00:03:02.370> knows<00:03:03.090> the

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:03.329 
experienced last season he knows the

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:05.600 
experienced last season he knows the
course<00:03:03.599> and<00:03:03.900> the<00:03:04.500> peloton<00:03:04.950> a<00:03:04.980> lot<00:03:05.159> better<00:03:05.400> than

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
course and the peloton a lot better than

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:08.000 
course and the peloton a lot better than
or<00:03:06.480> the<00:03:06.659> roads<00:03:06.840> of<00:03:07.019> France<00:03:07.049> and<00:03:07.500> the<00:03:07.620> peloton<00:03:07.950> a

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
or the roads of France and the peloton a

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.940 
or the roads of France and the peloton a
lot<00:03:08.220> better<00:03:08.400> than<00:03:08.790> what<00:03:09.440> he<00:03:10.440> wouldn't<00:03:10.709> would

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
lot better than what he wouldn't would

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:12.470 
lot better than what he wouldn't would
have<00:03:11.040> known<00:03:11.220> last<00:03:11.489> year<00:03:11.849> after<00:03:12.150> three<00:03:12.329> and<00:03:12.420> a

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
have known last year after three and a

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.449 
have known last year after three and a
half<00:03:12.540> years<00:03:12.900> absence<00:03:13.049> and<00:03:13.829> also<00:03:14.220> most

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
half years absence and also most

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:17.000 
half years absence and also most
importantly<00:03:14.549> I<00:03:15.060> think<00:03:15.360> he's<00:03:15.569> got<00:03:16.440> that<00:03:16.590> hunger

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
importantly I think he's got that hunger

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:18.770 
importantly I think he's got that hunger
to<00:03:17.129> win<00:03:17.280> this<00:03:17.459> year's<00:03:17.760> tour<00:03:18.000> last<00:03:18.329> year<00:03:18.450> he<00:03:18.659> was

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
to win this year's tour last year he was

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.660 
to win this year's tour last year he was
pretty<00:03:19.049> much<00:03:19.200> feeling<00:03:19.500> his<00:03:19.709> way<00:03:19.920> a<00:03:19.950> bit<00:03:20.190> this

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
pretty much feeling his way a bit this

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:22.220 
pretty much feeling his way a bit this
year<00:03:20.730> he<00:03:21.090> really<00:03:21.329> wants<00:03:21.569> to<00:03:21.659> win<00:03:21.750> it<00:03:21.900> and<00:03:22.049> he'll

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
year he really wants to win it and he'll

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:23.809 
year he really wants to win it and he'll
rise<00:03:22.500> to<00:03:22.709> the<00:03:22.799> occasion<00:03:22.829> of<00:03:23.280> his<00:03:23.430> battle<00:03:23.790> with

00:03:23.809 --> 00:03:23.819 
rise to the occasion of his battle with

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:28.220 
rise to the occasion of his battle with
Alberto<00:03:24.510> Contador

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:31.970 

well<00:03:29.230> for<00:03:29.499> me<00:03:29.620> it<00:03:30.069> will<00:03:30.280> be<00:03:30.459> very<00:03:30.969> difficult

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
well for me it will be very difficult

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:37.080 
well for me it will be very difficult
because<00:03:33.239> this<00:03:34.239> year<00:03:34.480> he<00:03:35.049> arrived<00:03:35.499> third<00:03:35.889> and<00:03:36.430> I

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.090 
because this year he arrived third and I

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:39.449 
because this year he arrived third and I
mean<00:03:37.480> last<00:03:37.749> year<00:03:37.900> this<00:03:38.650> year<00:03:38.709> you<00:03:39.099> would<00:03:39.219> be

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:39.459 
mean last year this year you would be

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:43.470 
mean last year this year you would be
have<00:03:39.819> a<00:03:39.959> one<00:03:40.959> year<00:03:41.170> more<00:03:41.409> and<00:03:42.090> contador<00:03:43.090> and

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 
have a one year more and contador and

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:45.740 
have a one year more and contador and
then<00:03:43.719> each<00:03:43.840> leg<00:03:44.079> should<00:03:44.530> be<00:03:44.590> stronger<00:03:45.519> than

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
then each leg should be stronger than

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:50.039 
then each leg should be stronger than
2009<00:03:46.799> but<00:03:47.799> it's<00:03:48.609> also<00:03:48.790> true<00:03:49.180> that<00:03:49.209> with<00:03:49.930> the

00:03:50.039 --> 00:03:50.049 
2009 but it's also true that with the

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:56.640 
2009 but it's also true that with the
man<00:03:50.879> as<00:03:52.109> Armstrong<00:03:53.250> Never<00:03:54.250> Say<00:03:54.340> Never<00:03:54.579> so<00:03:55.650> for

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:56.650 
man as Armstrong Never Say Never so for

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:00.599 
man as Armstrong Never Say Never so for
me<00:03:56.769> it's<00:03:57.519> unlikely<00:03:57.969> that<00:03:58.829> he<00:03:59.829> would<00:04:00.129> win<00:04:00.340> to

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:00.609 
me it's unlikely that he would win to

00:04:00.609 --> 00:04:04.570 
me it's unlikely that he would win to
the<00:04:00.790> France<00:04:01.000> but<00:04:01.209> I'm<00:04:01.359> not<00:04:01.540> sure<00:04:01.569> of<00:04:01.959> that

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:04.580 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:08.720 

yeah<00:04:05.580> I<00:04:05.610> think<00:04:05.970> he<00:04:06.240> can<00:04:06.890> he's<00:04:07.890> showing<00:04:08.700> that

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
yeah I think he can he's showing that

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:12.230 
yeah I think he can he's showing that
his<00:04:08.970> form<00:04:09.319> this<00:04:10.319> year<00:04:10.650> is<00:04:10.950> already<00:04:11.819> is<00:04:12.000> better

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:12.240 
his form this year is already is better

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:14.780 
his form this year is already is better
than<00:04:12.390> what<00:04:12.569> it<00:04:12.660> was<00:04:12.690> last<00:04:13.050> year<00:04:13.260> and<00:04:14.100> I<00:04:14.520> think

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
than what it was last year and I think

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:16.640 
than what it was last year and I think
the<00:04:14.940> thing<00:04:15.180> that's<00:04:15.240> always<00:04:15.870> motivated

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:16.650 
the thing that's always motivated

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:20.539 
the thing that's always motivated
Armstrong<00:04:17.130> is<00:04:17.810> a<00:04:18.810> fierce<00:04:19.560> rivalry<00:04:20.100> and<00:04:20.250> I

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:20.549 
Armstrong is a fierce rivalry and I

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:22.460 
Armstrong is a fierce rivalry and I
don't<00:04:20.790> think<00:04:21.000> he's<00:04:21.269> had<00:04:21.450> a<00:04:21.480> rivalry<00:04:22.019> through

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:22.470 
don't think he's had a rivalry through

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:23.810 
don't think he's had a rivalry through
his<00:04:22.620> career<00:04:22.860> any<00:04:23.040> bigger<00:04:23.250> than<00:04:23.340> what<00:04:23.520> he's<00:04:23.639> got

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:23.820 
his career any bigger than what he's got

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:28.159 
his career any bigger than what he's got
with<00:04:23.970> Contador<00:04:24.830> and<00:04:26.960> results<00:04:27.960> speak<00:04:28.110> for

00:04:28.159 --> 00:04:28.169 
with Contador and results speak for

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:30.140 
with Contador and results speak for
themselves<00:04:28.350> the<00:04:28.830> guys<00:04:29.010> done<00:04:29.250> it<00:04:29.400> I<00:04:29.550> know<00:04:29.880> his

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:30.150 
themselves the guys done it I know his

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:32.750 
themselves the guys done it I know his
age<00:04:30.330> counts<00:04:30.750> against<00:04:31.080> him<00:04:31.139> but<00:04:31.889> I<00:04:32.280> think<00:04:32.460> he's

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:32.760 
age counts against him but I think he's

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:36.530 
age counts against him but I think he's
very<00:04:32.940> capable<00:04:33.150> of<00:04:33.510> doing<00:04:33.750> it<00:04:33.870> at<00:04:34.169> the<00:04:34.260> time

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:36.540 

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:39.960 

now<00:04:37.540> I<00:04:37.570> don't<00:04:37.780> think<00:04:38.050> he<00:04:38.320> can<00:04:38.590> I<00:04:38.920> think<00:04:39.460> what's

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:39.970 
now I don't think he can I think what's

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:42.060 
now I don't think he can I think what's
happening<00:04:40.420> with<00:04:40.540> Lance's<00:04:41.110> although<00:04:41.500> he's<00:04:41.770> got

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:42.070 
happening with Lance's although he's got

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:44.610 
happening with Lance's although he's got
a<00:04:42.100> challenge<00:04:42.640> I'm<00:04:42.970> questioning<00:04:43.690> the<00:04:44.290> strength

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:44.620 
a challenge I'm questioning the strength

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:46.730 
a challenge I'm questioning the strength
of<00:04:44.830> the<00:04:44.950> team<00:04:44.980> that<00:04:45.460> he's<00:04:45.610> got<00:04:45.880> with<00:04:46.120> him<00:04:46.150> and

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:46.740 
of the team that he's got with him and

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:50.160 
of the team that he's got with him and
I'm<00:04:47.740> thinking<00:04:48.100> that<00:04:48.400> his<00:04:48.490> age<00:04:48.760> will<00:04:49.390> start<00:04:49.930> to

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:50.170 
I'm thinking that his age will start to

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:55.890 
I'm thinking that his age will start to
impact<00:04:50.620> on<00:04:50.950> his<00:04:51.250> ability<00:04:51.960> from<00:04:52.960> this<00:04:53.530> year

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:55.900 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:59.040 

I<00:04:56.430> think<00:04:57.430> Lance<00:04:58.060> Armstrong<00:04:58.540> can<00:04:58.720> absolutely

00:04:59.040 --> 00:04:59.050 
I think Lance Armstrong can absolutely

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:01.140 
I think Lance Armstrong can absolutely
win<00:04:59.470> this<00:04:59.620> year's<00:04:59.830> Tour<00:05:00.070> de<00:05:00.160> France<00:05:00.400> because

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:01.150 
win this year's Tour de France because

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:02.790 
win this year's Tour de France because
not<00:05:01.479> only<00:05:01.509> is<00:05:01.750> he<00:05:01.840> going<00:05:02.050> to<00:05:02.080> be<00:05:02.139> better

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:02.800 
not only is he going to be better

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:04.650 
not only is he going to be better
prepared<00:05:03.009> physically<00:05:03.759> but<00:05:04.360> he's<00:05:04.479> going<00:05:04.600> to

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:04.660 
prepared physically but he's going to

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:07.620 
prepared physically but he's going to
have<00:05:04.720> that<00:05:05.320> same<00:05:05.680> amazing<00:05:06.250> team<00:05:06.490> or<00:05:07.000> very

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:09.160 
similar amazing team that he had in

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:11.610 
similar amazing team that he had in
years<00:05:09.280> past<00:05:09.690> we<00:05:10.690> have<00:05:10.870> the<00:05:11.050> knowledge<00:05:11.229> with

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:11.620 
years past we have the knowledge with

00:05:18.779 --> 00:05:18.789 
for Tomb Raider Shack but that's all

00:05:18.789 --> 00:05:20.879 
for Tomb Raider Shack but that's all
right<00:05:18.940> I<00:05:19.150> believe<00:05:19.810> that<00:05:19.840> we<00:05:20.440> have<00:05:20.590> all<00:05:20.740> the

00:05:20.879 --> 00:05:20.889 
right I believe that we have all the

00:05:20.889 --> 00:05:22.260 
right I believe that we have all the
weapons<00:05:21.039> necessary<00:05:21.430> and<00:05:21.970> we're<00:05:22.120> going<00:05:22.240> to

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:22.270

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:28.410 

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:33.270 

let's<00:05:29.410> said<00:05:29.620> yes<00:05:30.930> because<00:05:31.930> I<00:05:32.139> think<00:05:32.650> he's<00:05:33.129> got

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:33.280 
let's said yes because I think he's got

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:38.999 
let's said yes because I think he's got
a<00:05:33.340> lot<00:05:34.030> of<00:05:34.090> experience<00:05:34.810> and<00:05:36.870> just<00:05:37.870> I<00:05:38.319> asked<00:05:38.860> him

00:05:38.999 --> 00:05:39.009 
a lot of experience and just I asked him

00:05:39.009 --> 00:05:41.159 
a lot of experience and just I asked him
a<00:05:39.129> question<00:05:39.300> in<00:05:40.300> the<00:05:40.449> show<00:05:40.599> that<00:05:40.750> is<00:05:40.840> a<00:05:40.990> last

00:05:41.159 --> 00:05:41.169 
a question in the show that is a last

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:46.320 
a question in the show that is a last
year<00:05:41.409> and<00:05:42.659> not<00:05:43.659> real<00:05:43.930> question<00:05:44.319> I<00:05:44.470> said<00:05:44.710> I<00:05:45.370> want

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:46.330 
year and not real question I said I want

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:50.249 
year and not real question I said I want
to<00:05:46.949> felicitations<00:05:47.949> for<00:05:48.310> your<00:05:48.520> truck<00:05:49.240> cuz<00:05:49.449> I

00:05:50.249 --> 00:05:50.259 
to felicitations for your truck cuz I

00:05:50.259 --> 00:05:52.170 
to felicitations for your truck cuz I
was<00:05:50.560> shred<00:05:50.860> the<00:05:50.979> beginning<00:05:51.280> you<00:05:51.400> you<00:05:51.789> won't

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:52.180 
was shred the beginning you you won't

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:55.439 
was shred the beginning you you won't
finish<00:05:52.449> on<00:05:52.750> the<00:05:52.900> top<00:05:53.110> 10<00:05:53.379> and<00:05:53.800> so<00:05:54.789> it<00:05:55.180> was<00:05:55.300> on

00:05:55.439 --> 00:05:55.449 
finish on the top 10 and so it was on

00:05:55.449 --> 00:05:57.930 
finish on the top 10 and so it was on
the<00:05:55.539> podium<00:05:55.690> and<00:05:56.080> the<00:05:56.289> answer<00:05:56.740> it<00:05:57.610> would<00:05:57.819> be

00:05:57.930 --> 00:05:57.940 
the podium and the answer it would be

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:01.020 
the podium and the answer it would be
better<00:05:58.120> next<00:05:58.630> year<00:05:59.009> so<00:06:00.009> I<00:06:00.280> think<00:06:00.400> it<00:06:00.729> could<00:06:00.909> be

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:01.030 
better next year so I think it could be

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:05.629 
better next year so I think it could be
better<00:06:01.180> this<00:06:01.780> year<00:06:01.840> and<00:06:02.849> maybe<00:06:03.849> not<00:06:04.090> win<00:06:04.360> but<00:06:04.389> I

00:06:05.629 --> 00:06:05.639 
better this year and maybe not win but I

00:06:05.639 --> 00:06:10.710 
better this year and maybe not win but I
let<00:06:06.639> sit<00:06:06.849> second<00:06:07.270> but<00:06:08.880> lots<00:06:09.880> of<00:06:09.970> respect<00:06:10.449> fine

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:10.720 
let sit second but lots of respect fine

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:14.680 
let sit second but lots of respect fine
anyway

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:14.690 

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:18.740 

yes<00:06:15.690> he<00:06:15.840> can<00:06:15.990> real<00:06:16.230> this<00:06:16.770> maybe<00:06:17.040> not<00:06:17.720> the<00:06:18.720> best

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:18.750 
yes he can real this maybe not the best

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:21.440 
yes he can real this maybe not the best
anymore<00:06:19.320> but<00:06:19.680> I<00:06:19.920> think<00:06:20.340> that<00:06:20.400> Contador<00:06:21.210> is<00:06:21.240> a

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:21.450 
anymore but I think that Contador is a

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:23.630 
anymore but I think that Contador is a
little<00:06:21.720> bit<00:06:21.840> higher<00:06:21.990> level<00:06:22.440> but<00:06:23.250> we<00:06:23.370> all<00:06:23.460> know

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:23.640 
little bit higher level but we all know

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:26.270 
little bit higher level but we all know
that<00:06:23.670> lens<00:06:24.360> is<00:06:24.540> the<00:06:24.660> smartest<00:06:25.050> one<00:06:25.290> and<00:06:25.500> that

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:26.280 
that lens is the smartest one and that

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:29.300 
that lens is the smartest one and that
means<00:06:26.610> that<00:06:26.760> technically<00:06:27.660> he<00:06:28.350> will<00:06:28.560> do<00:06:28.950> some

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:29.310 
means that technically he will do some

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:32.090 
means that technically he will do some
strange<00:06:30.300> things<00:06:30.450> but<00:06:31.260> going<00:06:31.410> to<00:06:31.500> make<00:06:31.620> this<00:06:31.830> to

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:32.100 
strange things but going to make this to

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:34.830 
strange things but going to make this to
a<00:06:32.130> very<00:06:32.490> exciting

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:34.840 

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:41.180 

I<00:06:35.460> think<00:06:37.949> impossible<00:06:38.949> to<00:06:39.370> win<00:06:39.550> because

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:41.190 
I think impossible to win because

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:50.580 
I think impossible to win because
contador<00:06:42.190> master<00:06:43.090> on<00:06:43.210> and<00:06:45.479> all<00:06:47.340> too<00:06:48.340> old<00:06:49.590> for

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:50.590 
contador master on and all too old for

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:54.270 
contador master on and all too old for
winning<00:06:51.150> two<00:06:52.150> different<00:06:52.479> I'm<00:06:53.410> some<00:06:53.830> too<00:06:54.070> old

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:54.280 
winning two different I'm some too old

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:57.659 
winning two different I'm some too old
now<00:06:55.060> yeah

00:06:57.659 --> 00:06:57.669 
now yeah

00:06:57.669 --> 00:07:00.479 
now yeah
if<00:06:58.669> he's<00:06:58.969> on<00:06:59.089> the<00:06:59.209> start<00:06:59.419> line<00:06:59.479> he<00:06:59.749> can<00:06:59.929> win<00:07:00.110> it

00:07:00.479 --> 00:07:00.489 
if he's on the start line he can win it

00:07:00.489 --> 00:07:04.359 
if he's on the start line he can win it
but<00:07:01.489> he's<00:07:02.269> not<00:07:02.449> the<00:07:02.509> number<00:07:02.779> one<00:07:03.050> favorite<00:07:03.469> but

00:07:04.359 --> 00:07:04.369 
but he's not the number one favorite but

00:07:04.369 --> 00:07:05.889 
but he's not the number one favorite but
anything<00:07:04.729> can<00:07:04.819> happen<00:07:04.969> container<00:07:05.659> of<00:07:05.779> my

00:07:05.889 --> 00:07:05.899 
anything can happen container of my

00:07:05.899 --> 00:07:09.790 
anything can happen container of my
crash<00:07:06.699> but<00:07:07.699> at<00:07:08.149> this<00:07:08.300> stage<00:07:08.360> would<00:07:08.749> say<00:07:08.989> Lance

00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:09.800 
crash but at this stage would say Lance

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:12.849 
crash but at this stage would say Lance
needs<00:07:10.039> Contador<00:07:10.519> to<00:07:10.639> crash
