Paul<00:00:07.080> with<00:00:07.200> otoscope<00:00:07.680> and<00:00:07.919> today<00:00:08.099> we<00:00:08.189> had<00:00:08.309> a

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
Paul with otoscope and today we had a

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.020 
Paul with otoscope and today we had a
client<00:00:08.519> coming<00:00:08.760> with<00:00:08.910> a<00:00:08.970> BMW<00:00:09.620> 325i<00:00:10.759> 2005<00:00:11.759> model

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
client coming with a BMW 325i 2005 model

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.600 
client coming with a BMW 325i 2005 model
and<00:00:12.420> she<00:00:13.080> was<00:00:13.559> concerned<00:00:13.860> that<00:00:14.009> there<00:00:14.190> was<00:00:14.400> a

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
and she was concerned that there was a

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.700 
and she was concerned that there was a
rotational<00:00:15.360> kind<00:00:15.750> of<00:00:15.809> grinding<00:00:16.199> noise<00:00:16.440> coming

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
rotational kind of grinding noise coming

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.290 
rotational kind of grinding noise coming
from<00:00:16.830> the<00:00:16.949> front<00:00:17.160> of<00:00:17.250> the<00:00:17.310> vehicle<00:00:17.699> they<00:00:18.150> would

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
from the front of the vehicle they would

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.269 
from the front of the vehicle they would
increase<00:00:18.510> in<00:00:18.810> speed<00:00:19.109> and<00:00:19.410> volume<00:00:19.980> when<00:00:20.130> she

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
increase in speed and volume when she

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:21.980 
increase in speed and volume when she
pressed<00:00:20.490> on<00:00:20.609> the<00:00:20.699> accelerator<00:00:21.240> so<00:00:21.689> let's<00:00:21.840> take

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
pressed on the accelerator so let's take

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.480 
pressed on the accelerator so let's take
a<00:00:22.020> look<00:00:22.230> at<00:00:22.350> some<00:00:22.500> of<00:00:22.590> the<00:00:22.650> possible<00:00:23.010> causes

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
a look at some of the possible causes

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.620 
a look at some of the possible causes
and<00:00:23.519> possible<00:00:24.090> solutions

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:26.630 
and possible solutions

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:29.029 
and possible solutions
once<00:00:27.630> our<00:00:27.779> clients<00:00:28.080> car<00:00:28.289> was<00:00:28.439> in<00:00:28.529> the<00:00:28.560> shop<00:00:28.650> we

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
once our clients car was in the shop we

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:30.529 
once our clients car was in the shop we
were<00:00:29.160> able<00:00:29.250> to<00:00:29.400> tell<00:00:29.670> that<00:00:29.849> the<00:00:29.970> rotational

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
were able to tell that the rotational

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.330 
were able to tell that the rotational
noises<00:00:30.960> that<00:00:31.140> she<00:00:31.320> was<00:00:31.470> hearing<00:00:31.830> we're

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
noises that she was hearing we're

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:33.889 
noises that she was hearing we're
actually<00:00:32.489> coming<00:00:32.730> from<00:00:32.880> the<00:00:33.090> belt<00:00:33.420> tensioners

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
actually coming from the belt tensioners

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.709 
actually coming from the belt tensioners
located<00:00:34.620> here<00:00:34.980> and<00:00:35.190> here<00:00:36.000> on<00:00:36.239> this<00:00:36.420> diagram

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
located here and here on this diagram

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.680 
located here and here on this diagram
and<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:37.890> idler<00:00:38.040> pulley<00:00:38.190> which<00:00:38.670> is<00:00:38.850> here<00:00:39.149> all

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
and the idler pulley which is here all

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.660 
and the idler pulley which is here all
three<00:00:39.930> of<00:00:40.050> those<00:00:40.110> components<00:00:40.770> help<00:00:41.100> maintain

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
three of those components help maintain

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.060 
three of those components help maintain
proper<00:00:42.030> tension<00:00:42.390> on<00:00:42.540> the<00:00:42.809> drive<00:00:43.170> belts<00:00:43.739> on<00:00:43.890> the

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
proper tension on the drive belts on the

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.799 
proper tension on the drive belts on the
car<00:00:44.340> so<00:00:44.940> what<00:00:45.149> we're<00:00:45.239> gonna<00:00:45.329> have<00:00:45.420> to<00:00:45.570> do<00:00:45.690> is

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
car so what we're gonna have to do is

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.380 
car so what we're gonna have to do is
replace<00:00:46.110> those<00:00:46.500> over<00:00:47.370> time<00:00:47.550> with<00:00:47.879> age<00:00:48.180> and

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
replace those over time with age and

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.080 
replace those over time with age and
mileage<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:49.590> grease<00:00:50.370> wears<00:00:50.640> out<00:00:50.879> and<00:00:50.910> the

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
mileage the grease wears out and the

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.240 
mileage the grease wears out and the
bearings<00:00:51.420> start<00:00:51.660> to<00:00:51.780> fail<00:00:51.989> so<00:00:52.620> next<00:00:53.129> we'll

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
bearings start to fail so next we'll

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.880 
bearings start to fail so next we'll
take<00:00:53.370> a<00:00:53.430> look<00:00:53.520> at<00:00:53.760> the<00:00:54.140> replacement<00:00:55.140> parts<00:00:55.680> as

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
take a look at the replacement parts as

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.580 
take a look at the replacement parts as
well<00:00:56.100> as<00:00:56.160> the<00:00:56.250> old<00:00:56.430> parts<00:00:57.050> here's<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:58.260> first

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
well as the old parts here's the first

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:59.869 
well as the old parts here's the first
play<00:00:58.800> that<00:00:58.890> we're<00:00:59.100> going<00:00:59.190> to<00:00:59.280> talk<00:00:59.460> about<00:00:59.609> this

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
play that we're going to talk about this

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.970 
play that we're going to talk about this
is<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.149> tensioner<00:01:00.510> pulley<00:01:00.719> for<00:01:01.050> the<00:01:01.199> belt

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
is the tensioner pulley for the belt

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.149 
is the tensioner pulley for the belt
that<00:01:02.070> runs<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:02.430> AC<00:01:02.609> compressor<00:01:03.149> and<00:01:03.799> you<00:01:04.799> tell

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
that runs the AC compressor and you tell

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:06.740 
that runs the AC compressor and you tell
that<00:01:05.189> it's<00:01:05.369> quite<00:01:05.970> old<00:01:06.180> as<00:01:06.390> it<00:01:06.570> originally

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
that it's quite old as it originally

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.050 
that it's quite old as it originally
came<00:01:07.170> with<00:01:07.380> the<00:01:07.500> vehicle<00:01:07.680> and<00:01:08.280> if<00:01:08.820> you<00:01:08.909> listen

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
came with the vehicle and if you listen

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.429 
came with the vehicle and if you listen
carefully<00:01:09.299> you'll<00:01:09.659> be<00:01:09.750> able<00:01:09.810> to<00:01:09.930> hear<00:01:10.229> the

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
carefully you'll be able to hear the

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.830 
carefully you'll be able to hear the
bearings<00:01:11.100> in<00:01:11.189> there<00:01:11.310> that<00:01:11.549> are<00:01:11.729> loose<00:01:12.060> this<00:01:12.630> is

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
bearings in there that are loose this is

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
bearings in there that are loose this is
the<00:01:12.990> reason<00:01:13.290> that<00:01:13.320> we<00:01:13.500> are<00:01:13.650> replacing<00:01:13.920> this

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:23.860 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:26.130 

and<00:01:24.460> one<00:01:24.700> another<00:01:24.850> one<00:01:25.510> other<00:01:25.660> thing<00:01:25.930> that<00:01:25.960> I

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:26.140 
and one another one other thing that I

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:30.300 
and one another one other thing that I
should<00:01:26.200> mention<00:01:26.560> is<00:01:27.370> I<00:01:28.590> can<00:01:29.590> show<00:01:29.800> you<00:01:29.860> here<00:01:30.130> on

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:30.310 
should mention is I can show you here on

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:32.850 
should mention is I can show you here on
the<00:01:30.400> new<00:01:30.550> unit<00:01:31.140> you<00:01:32.140> can<00:01:32.260> see<00:01:32.410> that<00:01:32.560> this<00:01:32.650> does

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:32.860 
the new unit you can see that this does

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:34.740 
the new unit you can see that this does
not<00:01:32.890> spin<00:01:33.400> quite<00:01:33.700> as<00:01:33.880> freely<00:01:34.270> that's<00:01:34.480> because

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:34.750 
not spin quite as freely that's because

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:38.010 
not spin quite as freely that's because
the<00:01:34.870> grease<00:01:35.110> in<00:01:35.260> here<00:01:35.440> is<00:01:35.530> fresh<00:01:36.930> you<00:01:37.930> know

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.020 
the grease in here is fresh you know

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:39.540 
the grease in here is fresh you know
comes<00:01:38.230> from<00:01:38.290> the<00:01:38.470> factory<00:01:38.830> it's<00:01:39.010> still<00:01:39.250> fresh

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:39.550 
comes from the factory it's still fresh

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:41.970 
comes from the factory it's still fresh
and<00:01:39.880> it's<00:01:40.630> able<00:01:40.750> to<00:01:40.900> do<00:01:41.050> its<00:01:41.200> job<00:01:41.410> much<00:01:41.770> much

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:41.980 
and it's able to do its job much much

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:49.830 
and it's able to do its job much much
better<00:01:47.970> the<00:01:48.970> second<00:01:49.330> pulley<00:01:49.510> that<00:01:49.720> we're

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:49.840 
better the second pulley that we're

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.120 
better the second pulley that we're
going<00:01:49.930> to<00:01:49.990> look<00:01:50.260> at<00:01:50.440> this<00:01:51.130> is<00:01:51.460> the<00:01:51.880> new<00:01:52.450> pulley

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
going to look at this is the new pulley

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.270 
going to look at this is the new pulley
which<00:01:54.130> is<00:01:54.370> the<00:01:54.820> middle<00:01:55.300> tensioner<00:01:55.979> pulley<00:01:56.979> and

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:57.280 
which is the middle tensioner pulley and

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.040 
which is the middle tensioner pulley and
again<00:01:57.880> you<00:01:58.030> can<00:01:58.180> see<00:01:58.360> that<00:01:58.600> because<00:01:58.870> it's

00:01:59.040 --> 00:01:59.050 
again you can see that because it's

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:03.150 
again you can see that because it's
fresh<00:02:01.410> brand<00:02:02.410> new<00:02:02.530> the<00:02:02.620> grease<00:02:02.830> is<00:02:02.950> still

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:03.160 
fresh brand new the grease is still

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:06.810 
fresh brand new the grease is still
fresh<00:02:03.370> it<00:02:03.880> does<00:02:04.120> not<00:02:04.360> want<00:02:04.600> to<00:02:04.720> spend<00:02:05.820> very

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:06.820 
fresh it does not want to spend very

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:09.180 
fresh it does not want to spend very
freely<00:02:07.270> at<00:02:07.360> all<00:02:07.530> the<00:02:08.530> bearings<00:02:08.830> are<00:02:08.979> still

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.190 
freely at all the bearings are still

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:10.590 
freely at all the bearings are still
very<00:02:09.399> tight<00:02:09.640> the<00:02:09.820> grease<00:02:10.000> is<00:02:10.149> packed<00:02:10.390> in<00:02:10.540> the

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:10.600 
very tight the grease is packed in the

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.480 
very tight the grease is packed in the
way<00:02:10.690> it<00:02:10.750> should<00:02:10.869> be<00:02:11.170> now<00:02:11.680> if<00:02:11.740> we<00:02:11.860> compare<00:02:12.070> that

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:12.490 
way it should be now if we compare that

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:16.770 
way it should be now if we compare that
to<00:02:14.250> the<00:02:15.250> used<00:02:15.490> pulley<00:02:15.790> you'll<00:02:16.420> be<00:02:16.570> able<00:02:16.630> to

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
to the used pulley you'll be able to

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.240 
to the used pulley you'll be able to
hear<00:02:16.959> the<00:02:17.110> noise<00:02:17.290> of<00:02:17.470> the<00:02:17.560> bearings<00:02:17.920> you<00:02:18.160> can

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
hear the noise of the bearings you can

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:19.680 
hear the noise of the bearings you can
see<00:02:18.400> that<00:02:18.550> they've<00:02:18.700> deteriorated<00:02:19.360> the<00:02:19.450> grease

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
see that they've deteriorated the grease

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.740 
see that they've deteriorated the grease
is<00:02:19.930> pretty<00:02:20.650> much<00:02:20.800> used<00:02:21.130> up<00:02:21.310> and<00:02:21.610> there<00:02:22.300> is<00:02:22.450> play

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
is pretty much used up and there is play

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.420 
is pretty much used up and there is play
in<00:02:22.990> the<00:02:23.050> shaft<00:02:25.530> which<00:02:26.530> you<00:02:26.680> should<00:02:26.920> you<00:02:27.340> know

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
in the shaft which you should you know

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:30.090 
in the shaft which you should you know
there<00:02:27.760> should<00:02:27.940> be<00:02:28.060> no<00:02:28.239> sound<00:02:28.510> and<00:02:28.870> here's<00:02:29.739> the

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.100 
there should be no sound and here's the

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.250 
there should be no sound and here's the
police<00:02:30.489> pinning<00:02:30.820> this<00:02:31.150> is<00:02:31.390> the<00:02:31.540> cause<00:02:31.750> of<00:02:31.780> the

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
police pinning this is the cause of the

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:41.770 
police pinning this is the cause of the
noise<00:02:32.440> that<00:02:32.500> the<00:02:32.860> client<00:02:33.220> heard

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:43.699 

and<00:02:42.780> as<00:02:42.930> we<00:02:43.049> could<00:02:43.200> hear<00:02:43.319> I'm<00:02:43.409> the<00:02:43.469> only<00:02:43.560> one

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
and as we could hear I'm the only one

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:45.860 
and as we could hear I'm the only one
who<00:02:43.829> did<00:02:44.040> not<00:02:44.159> do<00:02:44.430> that<00:02:44.659> that<00:02:45.659> pulley

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
who did not do that that pulley

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.229 
who did not do that that pulley
definitely<00:02:46.469> needs<00:02:46.709> to<00:02:46.950> be<00:02:47.069> replaced<00:02:47.459> again

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
definitely needs to be replaced again

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:51.920 
definitely needs to be replaced again
here's<00:02:48.750> the<00:02:49.159> the<00:02:50.159> idler<00:02:50.519> pulley<00:02:50.549> and<00:02:51.120> same

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
here's the the idler pulley and same

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.899 
here's the the idler pulley and same
thing<00:02:51.959> here<00:02:52.439> the<00:02:52.590> grease<00:02:52.799> is<00:02:52.980> still<00:02:53.670> fresh

00:02:53.899 --> 00:02:53.909 
thing here the grease is still fresh

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:56.209 
thing here the grease is still fresh
inside<00:02:54.359> from<00:02:54.629> the<00:02:54.719> factory<00:02:55.170> does<00:02:55.680> not<00:02:55.889> spin

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:56.219 
inside from the factory does not spin

00:02:56.219 --> 00:02:58.190 
inside from the factory does not spin
freely<00:02:56.939> but<00:02:57.209> it's<00:02:57.359> very<00:02:57.599> smooth<00:02:57.930> there's

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
freely but it's very smooth there's

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.550 
freely but it's very smooth there's
absolutely<00:02:58.590> no<00:02:58.859> play<00:02:59.129> in<00:02:59.280> the<00:02:59.370> shaft<00:02:59.609> and<00:03:00.560> so

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
absolutely no play in the shaft and so

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.860 
absolutely no play in the shaft and so
this<00:03:01.709> is<00:03:01.859> the<00:03:01.980> new<00:03:02.159> unit<00:03:02.549> as<00:03:02.730> compared<00:03:03.599> to<00:03:03.689> the

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
this is the new unit as compared to the

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.949 
this is the new unit as compared to the
old<00:03:04.109> unit<00:03:04.620> the<00:03:05.040> old<00:03:05.310> idler<00:03:05.700> pulley<00:03:05.939> again<00:03:06.719> this

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
old unit the old idler pulley again this

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:10.550 
old unit the old idler pulley again this
was<00:03:07.079> causing<00:03:07.349> excessive<00:03:07.799> noise<00:03:08.840> and<00:03:09.840> there's

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
was causing excessive noise and there's

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:19.759 
was causing excessive noise and there's
play<00:03:10.799> in<00:03:10.950> the<00:03:11.040> shaft<00:03:11.280> as<00:03:11.549> well<00:03:18.620> so<00:03:19.620> these

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:19.769 
play in the shaft as well so these

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:21.860 
play in the shaft as well so these
pulleys<00:03:20.159> will<00:03:20.310> be<00:03:20.489> replaced<00:03:20.879> the<00:03:21.359> noise<00:03:21.629> will

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
pulleys will be replaced the noise will

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:25.099 
pulleys will be replaced the noise will
go<00:03:22.019> away<00:03:22.230> for<00:03:22.530> the<00:03:22.650> client
