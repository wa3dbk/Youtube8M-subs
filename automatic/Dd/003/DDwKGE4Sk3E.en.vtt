 of the league between 2010 and 2012 enters into 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.480
 lice in the competition and welcomes the 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.100
 tfc winner créteil lap

 previous jose anigo line up a team 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.210
 competitive in lukas mendes is 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.400
 established in the field of defense 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.949
 sides of anne koulou khalifa companion 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.779
 gignac within the attacked Phocaean and 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.700
 small changes in the goals of 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.489
 Toulouse is Olivier Blondel who 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.530
 replace aly hamada olivier blondel 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:41.280
 we will see it in the first minutes 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:43.219
 squirted in the feet of saber khalifa and 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.239
 to interfere to the maximum 

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:47.550
 the Tunisian striker who had a beautiful 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.660
 opportunity but undeniably these are 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.059
 the Marseille people who are the most 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:54.120
 frisky this early game and this 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:56.910
 dominance is going to be concluded by the purpose of 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:00.000
 benjamin mendy from the 13th minute on 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:02.280
 lateral left Marseille marks his 2nd 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.719
 goal of the season him who had found the 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.729
 way of the nets in the league face to 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.560
 saint-etienne he allows marseille to 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.990
 lead 1-0 before the quarter of an hour of play 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.420
 a reaction from the Toulouse 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.799
 with this serge aurier head that 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.229
 goes a few inches from the post 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:18.840
 of steve mandanda but overall the 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:21.000
 Marseille are the most enterprising 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.110
 the most dangerous a situation in the 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.299
 surface to repair 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:30.270
 oliver blondel is at fault on the 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:32.220
 slowed down we see that the right foot of the 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.710
 Toulouse keeper hangs the one 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:37.500
 andré pierre gignac the attacker 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:37.979
 Olympian does justice to half an hour 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.240
 play 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:44.970
 marseille leads 2 to 0 and andré pierre 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.939
 gignac is on his way he who had 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.830
 scored Sunday in the league against 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:52.680
 lyon 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:55.020
 my little mistakes of concentration 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.030
 little looseness just before the break 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.490
 on the part of the Marseillais on this 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:03.000
 free kick of adrien regattin c ur rise 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.770
 spahic who marks steve mandanda is 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.330
 embarrassed in his exit by this balloon 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:11.730
 slightly affected by lukasz mendes 2-1 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:14.070
 at half-time for marseille and in 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:17.190
 second period the Olympians are going to have 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:18.960
 new opportunities with andré 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:22.380
 gignac stone acrobatically 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:24.450
 does not catch the blondel shot frame 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:26.390
 franc for toulouse steve mandanda is 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:29.640
 slightly too short 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:31.950
 it was complicated to intervene for the 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:35.660
 international guardian and a situation 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:37.260
 a little hot for the Toulouse 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:39.690
 luckily for mandanda 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.910
 it was abdullah who was then dropped 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:44.580
 of this balloon not a lot of things in 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:46.050
 second period marseille is needed 2 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.570
 goals to 1 after four matches without 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:50.340
 victory in all competitions 

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:52.770
 the om regain the scent of victory 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:56.000
 and will move to lyon for one of 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:56.000
 shocks from these quarterfinals
