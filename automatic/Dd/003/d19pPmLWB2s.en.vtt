00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.530 
the stitching is that you can actually
feel<00:01:27.930> that<00:01:28.080> there's<00:01:28.229> still<00:01:28.409> part<00:01:29.040> of<00:01:29.189> the

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:29.540 
feel that there's still part of the

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.910 
feel that there's still part of the
canvas<00:01:30.540> on<00:01:30.869> the<00:01:31.110> side<00:01:31.290> chick<00:01:31.409> so<00:01:31.590> it's<00:01:31.619> rough

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
canvas on the side chick so it's rough

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.109 
canvas on the side chick so it's rough
right<00:01:32.100> here<00:01:32.220> the<00:01:32.430> same<00:01:32.549> way<00:01:32.610> too<00:01:32.759> rough<00:01:32.970> on<00:01:33.030> the

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
right here the same way too rough on the

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:34.819 
right here the same way too rough on the
outside<00:01:33.180> edge<00:01:33.750> it's<00:01:34.200> rough<00:01:34.439> on<00:01:34.500> the<00:01:34.619> inside

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
outside edge it's rough on the inside

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.620 
outside edge it's rough on the inside
Actors<00:01:35.040> here<00:01:35.280> as<00:01:35.400> well<00:01:35.549> so<00:01:35.610> I<00:01:35.939> think<00:01:36.150> over<00:01:36.600> time

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
Actors here as well so I think over time

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.830 
Actors here as well so I think over time
you<00:01:37.049> could<00:01:37.350> possibly<00:01:38.070> start<00:01:38.820> to<00:01:39.000> a<00:01:39.030> scratch<00:01:39.630> or

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
you could possibly start to a scratch or

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.590 
you could possibly start to a scratch or
a<00:01:39.869> rub<00:01:40.320> on<00:01:40.530> the<00:01:40.740> edges<00:01:41.430> of<00:01:41.549> your<00:01:41.579> iPad<00:01:41.970> so<00:01:42.570> I

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
a rub on the edges of your iPad so I

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:43.760 
a rub on the edges of your iPad so I
mean<00:01:42.869> obviously<00:01:42.960> that<00:01:43.350> it's<00:01:43.500> brushed

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
mean obviously that it's brushed

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:44.870 
mean obviously that it's brushed
aluminum<00:01:44.220> on<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:44.310> side<00:01:44.520> so<00:01:44.640> you<00:01:44.700> probably

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
aluminum on the side so you probably

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.069 
aluminum on the side so you probably
wants<00:01:45.119> to<00:01:45.149> notice<00:01:45.450> too<00:01:45.570> much<00:01:45.720> but<00:01:45.899> if<00:01:45.990> you

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
wants to notice too much but if you

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.660 
wants to notice too much but if you
screen<00:01:46.530> with<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:46.770> get<00:01:47.040> in<00:01:47.130> contact<00:01:47.310> with<00:01:47.579> that

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
screen with the get in contact with that

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.609 
screen with the get in contact with that
edge<00:01:47.820> and<00:01:48.000> was<00:01:48.090> go<00:01:48.270> back<00:01:48.299> and<00:01:48.630> forth<00:01:48.720> you<00:01:49.320> could

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
edge and was go back and forth you could

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:50.870 
edge and was go back and forth you could
possibly<00:01:49.799> start<00:01:50.189> to<00:01:50.310> scratch<00:01:50.520> it<00:01:50.549> I<00:01:50.729> don't

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
possibly start to scratch it I don't

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:51.859 
possibly start to scratch it I don't
know<00:01:50.939> that<00:01:51.119> for<00:01:51.210> sure<00:01:51.270> does<00:01:51.540> i<00:01:51.570> haven't<00:01:51.750> used

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
know that for sure does i haven't used

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.300 
know that for sure does i haven't used
it<00:01:51.930> that<00:01:52.020> many<00:01:52.200> times<00:01:52.229> but<00:01:52.979> i<00:01:53.070> would<00:01:53.220> think

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
it that many times but i would think

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.980 
it that many times but i would think
over<00:01:53.549> time<00:01:53.579> if<00:01:54.299> you're<00:01:54.420> not<00:01:54.509> careful<00:01:54.689> of<00:01:54.899> how

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
over time if you're not careful of how

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.020 
over time if you're not careful of how
you<00:01:55.049> slide<00:01:55.290> in<00:01:55.439> there<00:01:55.590> it<00:01:56.070> could<00:01:56.159> possibly<00:01:56.790> do

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
you slide in there it could possibly do

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.270 
you slide in there it could possibly do
a<00:01:57.060> little<00:01:57.240> bit<00:01:57.390> of<00:01:57.420> rough<00:01:58.100> rubbing<00:01:59.100> the<00:01:59.189> ball

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
a little bit of rough rubbing the ball

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.370 
a little bit of rough rubbing the ball
on<00:01:59.460> that<00:01:59.610> okay<00:01:59.909> so<00:02:00.630> some<00:02:00.960> of<00:02:01.079> our<00:02:01.229> guys<00:02:01.320> is

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
on that okay so some of our guys is

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.170 
on that okay so some of our guys is
simply<00:02:01.860> a<00:02:01.890> nice<00:02:02.040> sleep<00:02:02.250> if<00:02:02.520> this<00:02:02.790> is<00:02:02.939> the<00:02:02.969> type

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
simply a nice sleep if this is the type

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.940 
simply a nice sleep if this is the type
of<00:02:03.210> style<00:02:03.450> together<00:02:03.840> into<00:02:04.170> this<00:02:04.619> one<00:02:04.799> retails

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
of style together into this one retails

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.679 
of style together into this one retails
for<00:02:05.159> forty<00:02:05.549> dollars<00:02:05.850> so<00:02:06.210> it's<00:02:06.390> not<00:02:06.450> too

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
for forty dollars so it's not too

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.359 
for forty dollars so it's not too
expensive<00:02:06.719> and<00:02:07.350> i<00:02:07.740> can<00:02:07.890> say<00:02:07.979> that<00:02:08.099> will<00:02:08.190> fit

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
expensive and i can say that will fit

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.160 
expensive and i can say that will fit
the<00:02:08.399> ipad<00:02:08.729> 2<00:02:08.879> in<00:02:09.000> a<00:02:09.060> wool<00:02:09.149> for<00:02:09.330> the<00:02:09.450> ipad<00:02:09.750> 1<00:02:09.959> and

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
the ipad 2 in a wool for the ipad 1 and

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.570 
the ipad 2 in a wool for the ipad 1 and
it<00:02:10.619> does<00:02:10.770> pretty<00:02:10.920> good<00:02:11.039> job<00:02:11.220> of<00:02:11.280> just<00:02:11.430> keep

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
it does pretty good job of just keep

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:12.800 
it does pretty good job of just keep
them<00:02:11.670> protected<00:02:11.849> obviously<00:02:12.420> you<00:02:12.540> have<00:02:12.720> to

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
them protected obviously you have to

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:13.190 
them protected obviously you have to
take<00:02:12.959> your

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
take your

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.170 
take your
head<00:02:13.379> out<00:02:13.470> to<00:02:13.739> use<00:02:13.890> it<00:02:14.040> is<00:02:14.520> not<00:02:14.670> be<00:02:14.760> protected

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
head out to use it is not be protected

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:16.760 
head out to use it is not be protected
but<00:02:15.599> this<00:02:15.720> case<00:02:15.900> is<00:02:16.020> kind<00:02:16.200> of<00:02:16.260> thick<00:02:16.440> enough<00:02:16.620> a

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
but this case is kind of thick enough a

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:18.290 
but this case is kind of thick enough a
large<00:02:17.160> enough<00:02:17.340> for<00:02:17.400> if<00:02:17.670> your<00:02:17.760> if<00:02:18.060> you<00:02:18.150> had<00:02:18.269> a

large enough for if your if you had a

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.080 
large enough for if your if you had a

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
something like that nothing too large if

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:25.880 
something like that nothing too large if
I<00:02:24.450> fit<00:02:24.629> that<00:02:24.750> in<00:02:24.840> here<00:02:25.050> as<00:02:25.140> well<00:02:25.290> so<00:02:25.349> when<00:02:25.830> you
