125 gallon aquarium that they dug the
crap<00:02:05.310> out<00:02:05.520> of<00:02:05.549> I<00:02:06.030> had<00:02:06.600> everything<00:02:07.020> situated

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:17.630 
my rock
I<00:02:15.470> think<00:02:16.470> because<00:02:16.770> they<00:02:16.890> were<00:02:17.010> going<00:02:17.250> to<00:02:17.340> spawn

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
I think because they were going to spawn

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:24.820 
I think because they were going to spawn
I<00:02:18.000> put<00:02:18.870> these<00:02:18.990> little<00:02:23.000> clay<00:02:24.000> pots<00:02:24.030> in<00:02:24.540> there

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
I put these little clay pots in there

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:28.210 
I put these little clay pots in there
and<00:02:25.830> they<00:02:26.400> spawned<00:02:26.760> inside<00:02:27.150> that<00:02:27.360> clay<00:02:27.540> pot

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
and they spawned inside that clay pot

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.380 
and they spawned inside that clay pot
they<00:02:29.220> went<00:02:29.430> inside<00:02:29.550> there<00:02:30.000> and<00:02:30.090> laid<00:02:30.240> their

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
they went inside there and laid their

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.020 
they went inside there and laid their
eggs<00:02:30.420> and<00:02:31.050> did<00:02:31.740> their<00:02:31.920> their<00:02:32.430> business<00:02:32.820> in

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
eggs and did their their business in

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.020 
eggs and did their their business in
there<00:02:33.210> and<00:02:33.900> then<00:02:34.830> now<00:02:35.100> they've<00:02:35.370> some<00:02:35.700> reason

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
there and then now they've some reason

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.650 
there and then now they've some reason
moves<00:02:36.240> them<00:02:36.420> out<00:02:36.540> here<00:02:37.940> but<00:02:38.940> whatever<00:02:39.270> I<00:02:39.450> think

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
moves them out here but whatever I think

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.090 
moves them out here but whatever I think
it's<00:02:39.780> funny<00:02:39.960> because<00:02:40.140> the<00:02:40.500> little<00:02:40.710> guys<00:02:40.860> will

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100
