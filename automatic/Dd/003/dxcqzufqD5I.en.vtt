00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.150 

so<00:00:31.060> the<00:00:31.210> actual<00:00:31.300> changes<00:00:31.750> the<00:00:31.870> 0<00:00:32.170> not<00:00:32.650> many<00:00:32.890> but

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:33.160 
so the actual changes the 0 not many but

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.010 
so the actual changes the 0 not many but
they<00:00:33.460> did<00:00:33.760> change<00:00:34.000> the<00:00:34.150> group's<00:00:34.480> I<00:00:34.690> think<00:00:34.930> they

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:35.020 
they did change the group's I think they

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:36.630 
they did change the group's I think they
made<00:00:35.200> them<00:00:35.350> a<00:00:35.380> little<00:00:35.530> bit<00:00:35.680> longer<00:00:35.830> and<00:00:36.160> you

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:36.640 
made them a little bit longer and you

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.060 
made them a little bit longer and you
know<00:00:36.760> and<00:00:36.940> it<00:00:37.600> was<00:00:37.660> quite<00:00:38.380> nice<00:00:38.530> I<00:00:38.770> mean<00:00:38.890> you

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:40.540 
know sort of a little more room to grip

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:42.870 
know sort of a little more room to grip
onto<00:00:40.660> so<00:00:41.080> there<00:00:41.920> is<00:00:42.010> that<00:00:42.160> little<00:00:42.310> changed<00:00:42.730> it

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:46.690 
way that the power goes and everything

have been so good and the past years you
know<00:00:53.489> everything<00:00:54.489> you<00:00:54.640> can<00:00:54.760> down<00:00:54.910> to<00:00:55.090> the

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:55.180 
know everything you can down to the

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:56.750 
know everything you can down to the
adjustment<00:00:55.629> in<00:00:55.750> the<00:00:55.780> bars<00:00:55.989> at<00:00:56.170> the<00:00:56.260> front<00:00:56.470> here

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
adjustment in the bars at the front here

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:21.149 
adjustment in the bars at the front here
it's<00:00:57.760> good<00:00:57.940> white<00:00:58.530> pretty<00:00:59.530> pretty<00:00:59.800> happy

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:21.159 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:23.639 

I<00:01:21.479> think<00:01:22.479> one<00:01:22.570> of<00:01:22.600> the<00:01:22.719> cool<00:01:22.899> things<00:01:22.929> about<00:01:23.259> the

00:01:23.639 --> 00:01:23.649 
I think one of the cool things about the

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:26.039 
I think one of the cool things about the
new<00:01:24.249> for<00:01:24.490> 50s<00:01:24.909> and<00:01:25.210> the<00:01:25.240> Kawasaki<00:01:25.840> is<00:01:25.929> that

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:26.049 
new for 50s and the Kawasaki is that

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:27.450 
new for 50s and the Kawasaki is that
they<00:01:26.140> offer<00:01:26.289> the<00:01:26.499> three<00:01:26.770> different<00:01:26.920> ignition

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:27.460 
they offer the three different ignition

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:29.130 
they offer the three different ignition
plugs<00:01:27.670> that<00:01:27.789> you<00:01:27.939> can<00:01:28.090> use<00:01:28.210> you've<00:01:28.869> got<00:01:28.990> the

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:29.140 
plugs that you can use you've got the

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:30.959 
plugs that you can use you've got the
the<00:01:29.170> green<00:01:29.710> one<00:01:29.890> which<00:01:30.039> is<00:01:30.069> standard<00:01:30.399> then<00:01:30.880> you

00:01:30.959 --> 00:01:30.969 
the green one which is standard then you

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:33.539 
the green one which is standard then you
got<00:01:31.090> the<00:01:31.329> I<00:01:31.840> think<00:01:32.289> the<00:01:32.350> black<00:01:32.500> ones<00:01:32.740> the<00:01:33.009> more

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:33.549 
got the I think the black ones the more

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:36.330 
got the I think the black ones the more
sort<00:01:33.789> of<00:01:33.880> aggressive<00:01:34.240> kind<00:01:34.659> of<00:01:34.750> a<00:01:34.829> more<00:01:35.829> softer

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:36.340 
sort of aggressive kind of a more softer

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:38.010 
sort of aggressive kind of a more softer
a<00:01:36.369> number<00:01:36.819> one<00:01:36.999> which<00:01:37.209> gives<00:01:37.780> you<00:01:37.869> a<00:01:37.899> little

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.020 
a number one which gives you a little

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:39.690 
a number one which gives you a little
bit<00:01:38.200> more<00:01:38.319> pep<00:01:38.890> when<00:01:39.100> you<00:01:39.189> need<00:01:39.310> it<00:01:39.459> and<00:01:39.490> the

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:39.700 
bit more pep when you need it and the

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:41.730 
bit more pep when you need it and the
soft<00:01:40.030> terrain<00:01:40.259> I'm<00:01:41.259> going<00:01:41.380> to<00:01:41.439> be<00:01:41.500> heading

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:41.740 
soft terrain I'm going to be heading

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:43.349 
soft terrain I'm going to be heading
some<00:01:41.950> sort<00:01:42.130> us<00:01:42.459> out<00:01:42.549> there<00:01:42.729> later<00:01:42.880> so<00:01:43.119> i<00:01:43.149> guess

00:01:43.349 --> 00:01:43.359 
some sort us out there later so i guess

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:45.690 
some sort us out there later so i guess
that's<00:01:43.899> will<00:01:44.349> come<00:01:44.619> in<00:01:44.740> handy<00:01:44.770> and<00:01:45.579> then

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:45.700 
that's will come in handy and then

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.339 
that's will come in handy and then
therefore<00:01:45.880> the<00:01:46.030> muscle<00:01:46.420> is<00:01:46.539> the<00:01:46.750> free<00:01:46.959> skating

00:01:47.339 --> 00:01:47.349 
therefore the muscle is the free skating

00:01:47.349 --> 00:01:48.660 
therefore the muscle is the free skating
kind<00:01:47.590> of<00:01:47.709> stuff<00:01:47.920> you<00:01:48.099> know<00:01:48.219> you've<00:01:48.369> got<00:01:48.399> the

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:48.670 
kind of stuff you know you've got the

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.779 
kind of stuff you know you've got the
the<00:01:49.179> other<00:01:49.329> map<00:01:49.630> which<00:01:49.950> they<00:01:50.950> small<00:01:51.549> for<00:01:51.729> the

00:01:51.779 --> 00:01:51.789 
the other map which they small for the

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:53.609 
the other map which they small for the
hard<00:01:51.969> terrain<00:01:52.209> for<00:01:52.479> the<00:01:52.539> staff<00:01:52.750> and<00:01:52.990> while

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:53.619 
hard terrain for the staff and while

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:55.319 
hard terrain for the staff and while
covering<00:01:54.429> is<00:01:54.520> a<00:01:54.549> great<00:01:54.789> option<00:01:54.969> that<00:01:55.209> they've

00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:55.329 
covering is a great option that they've

00:01:55.329 --> 00:01:57.149 
covering is a great option that they've
got<00:01:55.479> the<00:01:56.229> map<00:01:56.409> that<00:01:56.530> i'd<00:01:56.649> probably<00:01:56.829> use<00:01:57.009> the

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:57.159 
got the map that i'd probably use the

00:01:57.159 --> 00:01:59.069 
got the map that i'd probably use the
most<00:01:57.310> on<00:01:57.549> the<00:01:57.579> 250<00:01:58.149> i<00:01:58.179> think<00:01:58.479> i<00:01:58.569> went<00:01:58.750> straight

00:01:59.069 --> 00:01:59.079 
most on the 250 i think i went straight

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:01.619 
most on the 250 i think i went straight
to<00:01:59.229> the<00:01:59.379> heart<00:02:00.099> the<00:02:00.579> soft<00:02:00.819> one<00:02:01.030> which<00:02:01.209> means<00:02:01.509> at

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:01.629 
to the heart the soft one which means at

00:02:01.629 --> 00:02:04.109 
to the heart the soft one which means at
its<00:02:01.719> bit<00:02:01.929> more<00:02:02.049> aggressive<00:02:02.140> I<00:02:02.729> quite<00:02:03.729> like<00:02:03.939> the

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:04.119 
its bit more aggressive I quite like the

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:05.699 
its bit more aggressive I quite like the
aggressiveness<00:02:04.689> and<00:02:04.899> then<00:02:05.079> the<00:02:05.349> two-stroke

00:02:05.699 --> 00:02:05.709 
aggressiveness and then the two-stroke

00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:07.559 
aggressiveness and then the two-stroke
front<00:02:05.920> of<00:02:06.069> filled<00:02:06.250> out<00:02:06.429> of<00:02:06.520> it<00:02:06.640> whereas<00:02:07.420> on<00:02:07.539> the

00:02:07.559 --> 00:02:07.569 
front of filled out of it whereas on the

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:09.270 
front of filled out of it whereas on the
450<00:02:08.140> I'm<00:02:08.229> not<00:02:08.410> sure<00:02:08.590> I'm<00:02:08.799> going<00:02:09.009> to<00:02:09.069> stick<00:02:09.220> with

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
450 I'm not sure I'm going to stick with

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.759 
450 I'm not sure I'm going to stick with
the<00:02:09.519> standard<00:02:09.849> for<00:02:09.940> a<00:02:09.970> little<00:02:10.090> while<00:02:10.299> and<00:02:11.260> I

00:02:11.759 --> 00:02:11.769 
the standard for a little while and I

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:13.559 
the standard for a little while and I
might<00:02:12.010> even<00:02:12.040> try<00:02:12.340> this<00:02:12.459> the<00:02:12.819> other<00:02:13.120> one<00:02:13.329> and

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
might even try this the other one and

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:15.750 
might even try this the other one and
for<00:02:13.930> the<00:02:13.989> heartache<00:02:14.319> terrain<00:02:14.620> let<00:02:15.340> me<00:02:15.430> see<00:02:15.640> how

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
for the heartache terrain let me see how

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.140 
for the heartache terrain let me see how
it<00:02:15.849> goes

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.209 

you
