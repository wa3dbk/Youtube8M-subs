use to look down into the water and see

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.430 
use to look down into the water and see
how<00:00:44.520> far<00:00:44.760> we<00:00:44.820> can<00:00:45.030> see<00:00:45.149> down<00:00:45.360> what<00:00:46.020> I<00:00:46.079> got<00:00:46.230> here

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
how far we can see down what I got here

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.950 
how far we can see down what I got here
is<00:00:46.590> uh<00:00:46.910> this<00:00:47.910> is<00:00:48.030> a<00:00:48.059> little<00:00:48.239> plate<00:00:48.450> that<00:00:48.690> is

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
is uh this is a little plate that is

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.560 
is uh this is a little plate that is
made<00:00:49.350> up<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.710> metal<00:00:50.370> plate<00:00:50.579> through<00:00:51.239> a<00:00:51.270> happy

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
made up the metal plate through a happy

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.500 
made up the metal plate through a happy
face<00:00:51.719> on<00:00:51.989> it<00:00:52.170> and<00:00:52.350> then<00:00:53.340> we<00:00:53.460> got<00:00:53.610> a<00:00:53.820> knot<00:00:54.210> every

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
face on it and then we got a knot every

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.380 
face on it and then we got a knot every
foot<00:00:55.379> on<00:00:55.860> the<00:00:56.070> line<00:00:56.250> so<00:00:56.969> when<00:00:57.090> you<00:00:57.149> lower<00:00:57.300> it

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
foot on the line so when you lower it

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.430 
foot on the line so when you lower it
down<00:00:57.449> you<00:00:57.750> just<00:00:57.870> call<00:00:58.020> it<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.170> knots<00:00:58.640> and

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:00.440 
down you just call it the knots and

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.139 
down you just call it the knots and
it'll<00:01:01.440> give<00:01:01.559> you<00:01:01.590> a<00:01:01.680> rough<00:01:02.489> estimate<00:01:02.940> pretty

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
it'll give you a rough estimate pretty

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:04.789 
it'll give you a rough estimate pretty
close<00:01:03.329> to<00:01:03.480> the<00:01:03.629> how<00:01:04.080> far<00:01:04.290> you<00:01:04.409> can<00:01:04.530> see<00:01:04.650> down

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
close to the how far you can see down

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.649 
close to the how far you can see down
have<00:01:05.100> this<00:01:05.250> obviously<00:01:05.790> it's<00:01:05.909> a<00:01:05.939> white<00:01:06.090> disc<00:01:06.330> so

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
have this obviously it's a white disc so

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.270 
have this obviously it's a white disc so
we<00:01:08.299> act<00:01:09.299> accordingly<00:01:09.810> upon<00:01:10.619> that<00:01:10.830> you<00:01:11.010> know<00:01:11.159> as

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
we act accordingly upon that you know as

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.359 
we act accordingly upon that you know as
far<00:01:11.430> as<00:01:12.350> what<00:01:13.350> you<00:01:13.439> can<00:01:13.470> see<00:01:13.740> if<00:01:13.979> you<00:01:14.070> see<00:01:14.189> well

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
far as what you can see if you see well

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:15.590 
far as what you can see if you see well
I<00:01:14.400> can<00:01:14.549> see<00:01:14.700> that<00:01:14.820> I<00:01:15.030> can<00:01:15.150> see<00:01:15.450> all<00:01:15.570> the

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
I can see that I can see all the

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.780 
I can see that I can see all the
markings<00:01:16.049> on<00:01:16.229> let<00:01:16.439> it<00:01:16.470> fit<00:01:16.799> 8<00:01:17.189> feet<00:01:17.400> crystal

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
markings on let it fit 8 feet crystal

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.020 
markings on let it fit 8 feet crystal
clear<00:01:18.000> but<00:01:18.780> at<00:01:19.740> 10<00:01:20.070> feet<00:01:20.369> it<00:01:20.549> could<00:01:20.729> just

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
clear but at 10 feet it could just

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.539 
clear but at 10 feet it could just
barely<00:01:21.270> make<00:01:21.509> it<00:01:21.540> out<00:01:21.689> maybe<00:01:21.960> who<00:01:22.560> knows<00:01:22.619> we'll

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
barely make it out maybe who knows we'll

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.700 
barely make it out maybe who knows we'll
know<00:01:23.790> when<00:01:23.970> we<00:01:24.090> put<00:01:24.210> it<00:01:24.330> down<00:01:24.479> but<00:01:24.720> then<00:01:25.530> that's

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
know when we put it down but then that's

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.410 
know when we put it down but then that's
what<00:01:25.890> you<00:01:26.009> do<00:01:26.130> and<00:01:26.369> then<00:01:26.460> you<00:01:26.490> just<00:01:26.640> we<00:01:27.210> just

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
what you do and then you just we just

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.289 
what you do and then you just we just
make<00:01:27.600> notes<00:01:27.810> of<00:01:27.990> it<00:01:28.140> mmm<00:01:28.640> GPS<00:01:29.640> the<00:01:29.759> spots<00:01:30.030> and

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
make notes of it mmm GPS the spots and

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.300 
make notes of it mmm GPS the spots and
doesn't<00:01:31.290> mean<00:01:31.380> there's<00:01:31.590> any<00:01:31.710> fish<00:01:31.920> here<00:01:32.130> but

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
doesn't mean there's any fish here but

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.490 
doesn't mean there's any fish here but
at<00:01:32.369> least<00:01:32.460> we<00:01:32.670> know<00:01:32.790> what<00:01:32.909> we<00:01:32.970> can<00:01:33.030> see<00:01:33.270> so<00:01:33.990> and

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
at least we know what we can see so and

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:41.179 
at least we know what we can see so and
then<00:01:34.619> the<00:01:34.710> other<00:01:34.829> thing<00:01:35.070> is<00:01:38.390> this<00:01:39.390> tuba<00:01:39.810> I<00:01:40.189> had

then the other thing is this tuba I had
a<00:01:41.220> guy<00:01:41.460> make<00:01:41.700> me<00:01:41.850> this<00:01:42.119> tube<00:01:42.360> up<00:01:42.540> for<00:01:43.290> years<00:01:43.470> we

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
a guy make me this tube up for years we

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.230 
a guy make me this tube up for years we
just<00:01:43.829> laid<00:01:44.009> down<00:01:44.040> on<00:01:44.430> a<00:01:44.460> blanket<00:01:44.670> or<00:01:44.939> whatever

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
just laid down on a blanket or whatever

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.990 
just laid down on a blanket or whatever
tarp<00:01:45.990> on<00:01:46.200> ice<00:01:46.439> and<00:01:46.740> covered<00:01:47.640> her<00:01:47.700> head<00:01:47.759> up<00:01:47.939> with

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
tarp on ice and covered her head up with

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.469 
tarp on ice and covered her head up with
a<00:01:48.090> blanket<00:01:48.390> looked<00:01:48.630> down<00:01:48.780> and<00:01:50.360> finally<00:01:51.360> they

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
a blanket looked down and finally they

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.600 
a blanket looked down and finally they
come<00:01:51.600> up<00:01:51.750> with<00:01:51.840> the<00:01:51.960> idea<00:01:52.229> hey<00:01:52.560> why<00:01:52.860> not<00:01:53.430> make<00:01:53.579> a

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
come up with the idea hey why not make a

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.969 
come up with the idea hey why not make a
tube<00:01:53.850> fits<00:01:54.360> right<00:01:54.540> in<00:01:54.720> the<00:01:54.869> hole<00:01:55.740> that<00:01:55.920> you

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
tube fits right in the hole that you

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.740 
tube fits right in the hole that you
drilled<00:01:56.340> and<00:01:56.969> then<00:01:57.090> you<00:01:57.210> can<00:01:57.329> just<00:01:57.479> don't<00:01:57.659> have

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
drilled and then you can just don't have

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.950 
drilled and then you can just don't have
to<00:01:57.810> lay<00:01:57.899> down<00:01:58.079> on<00:01:58.229> the<00:01:58.290> ice<00:01:58.439> so<00:01:59.600> that's<00:02:00.600> what<00:02:00.840> we

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
to lay down on the ice so that's what we

peanuts and then we don't see what we
can<00:02:37.710> come<00:02:37.770> up<00:02:37.860> with

well it's pretty good down til about

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:07.170 
well it's pretty good down til about
eight<00:03:02.960> feet<00:03:04.360> I'd<00:03:05.360> say<00:03:05.570> it's<00:03:05.750> a<00:03:05.900> sturgeon

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
eight feet I'd say it's a sturgeon

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:08.980 
eight feet I'd say it's a sturgeon
shanty<00:03:08.180> over<00:03:08.330> yep

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:08.990 
shanty over yep

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:12.520 
shanty over yep
no<00:03:09.710> problem<00:03:10.100> maybe<00:03:10.340> nine<00:03:10.750> but<00:03:11.750> once<00:03:12.260> you<00:03:12.380> get

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530 
no problem maybe nine but once you get

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:14.380 
no problem maybe nine but once you get
to<00:03:12.620> ten<00:03:12.830> feet<00:03:13.070> the<00:03:13.640> whiteness<00:03:14.000> got<00:03:14.180> pretty

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.390 
to ten feet the whiteness got pretty

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:17.740 
to ten feet the whiteness got pretty
blurry<00:03:14.680> and<00:03:15.680> I<00:03:16.330> don't<00:03:17.330> think<00:03:17.480> it's<00:03:17.600> see<00:03:17.720> a

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
blurry and I don't think it's see a

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:18.520 
blurry and I don't think it's see a
stairs<00:03:18.050> in<00:03:18.170> there

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530 
stairs in there

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:22.120 
stairs in there
and<00:03:18.860> this<00:03:19.820> here<00:03:20.030> is<00:03:20.150> about<00:03:20.560> 1718<00:03:21.560> feet<00:03:21.800> deep<00:03:21.980> of

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.130 
and this here is about 1718 feet deep of

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:23.770 
and this here is about 1718 feet deep of
water<00:03:22.280> here<00:03:22.490> so<00:03:22.700> you<00:03:22.790> got<00:03:22.940> a<00:03:22.970> lot<00:03:23.090> of<00:03:23.240> a<00:03:23.510> lot<00:03:23.720> of

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:23.780 
water here so you got a lot of a lot of

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:26.950 
water here so you got a lot of a lot of
water<00:03:23.990> below<00:03:24.170> you<00:03:24.380> but<00:03:25.600> we've<00:03:26.600> got<00:03:26.750> a<00:03:26.780> ways<00:03:26.930> to

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:26.960 
water below you but we've got a ways to

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:31.960 
water below you but we've got a ways to
go<00:03:27.140> yet<00:03:27.260> for<00:03:28.190> two<00:03:28.220> seasons<00:03:28.430> so<00:03:30.460> just<00:03:31.460> gives<00:03:31.670> you

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:31.970 
go yet for two seasons so just gives you

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:34.900 
go yet for two seasons so just gives you
an<00:03:32.030> idea<00:03:32.210> we<00:03:32.600> can<00:03:32.750> keep<00:03:32.960> checking<00:03:33.170> back<00:03:33.910> and

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:34.910 
an idea we can keep checking back and

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:36.190 
an idea we can keep checking back and
see<00:03:35.030> if<00:03:35.120> it's<00:03:35.240> clearing<00:03:35.540> up<00:03:35.690> at<00:03:35.840> all<00:03:35.990> or

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:36.200 
see if it's clearing up at all or

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:44.550 
see if it's clearing up at all or
getting<00:03:36.710> worse<00:03:36.920> or<00:03:37.190> whatever<00:03:37.460> well<00:03:43.000> that's

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560 
getting worse or whatever well that's

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:49.810 
getting worse or whatever well that's
that's<00:03:45.560> basically<00:03:46.040> how<00:03:46.310> we<00:03:46.340> door<00:03:46.580> and<00:03:48.820> it

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:49.820 
that's basically how we door and it

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:56.130 
that's basically how we door and it
beats<00:03:50.030> laying<00:03:50.270> down<00:03:50.450> on<00:03:50.660> the<00:03:51.400> ice<00:03:53.710> so

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:56.140 
beats laying down on the ice so

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:57.570 
beats laying down on the ice so
just<00:03:56.770> thought<00:03:56.890> I'd<00:03:56.980> share<00:03:57.130> that<00:03:57.340> with<00:03:57.460> you

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:57.580 
just thought I'd share that with you

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:59.970 
just thought I'd share that with you
show<00:03:58.120> you<00:03:58.180> how<00:03:58.360> somebody<00:03:58.720> else<00:03:58.750> checks<00:03:59.740> water

00:03:59.970 --> 00:03:59.980 
show you how somebody else checks water

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:01.380 
show you how somebody else checks water
I'm<00:04:00.069> sure<00:04:00.100> everybody's<00:04:00.550> got<00:04:00.700> a<00:04:00.730> different<00:04:01.150> way

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:01.390 
I'm sure everybody's got a different way

I'm sure everybody's got a different way
of<00:04:01.420> doing<00:04:01.569> things<00:04:01.890> laying<00:04:02.890> off<00:04:03.100> the<00:04:03.130> jagged

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:03.580 
of doing things laying off the jagged

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:05.550 
of doing things laying off the jagged
