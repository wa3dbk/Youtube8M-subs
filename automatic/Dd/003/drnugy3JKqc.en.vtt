Hi. This is ONE SHOT VIDEO about Motorola RAZR i.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:30.000
It works with 2 GHz Intel processor.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Camera button on the right side starts camera application also in sleep mode. 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Lock screen is simple, with 4 special shortcuts. 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Quick settings are not in upper roll bar, but there are on the home screen. 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:30.000
In the turn-off-menu restart is missing. 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:45.000
The interface is standard, Motorola brings to Android OS only few changes. 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:59.000
The three basic control buttons can always be found at the bottom of the screen.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Writing messages...

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:45.000
Motorola RAZR i is one of the fastest smartphones on the market.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:59.000
RAM 1 GB, real memory 5 GB + microSD.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:15.000
According to our information, the Motorola RAZR is sold only in selected European markets, but in Slovakia will probably never appear officially.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:40.000
The main message of this video is: Motorola still has something to say and Intel processors will play an important role in the future of smartphones.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:59.000
Google Nexus 4 is good phone. Looking at the HD IPS display, you can feel free to forget the Full HD resolution on that diagonal.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:15.000
Battery: 2 100 mAh

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:45.000
The battery is permanently integrated, you can't change it with stronger one like on Samsung Galaxy S III.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:59.000
Speaker could be much better. 

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:15.000
The biggest problem for me is the price tag of the device.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:30.000
Attention! 16 GB = real 13 GB without memory card slot.
