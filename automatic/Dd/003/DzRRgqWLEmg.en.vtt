00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:05.380
 or the plates and rope were still coming 

00:00:03.429 --> 00:00:09.280
 another new clairvoyant and how they saw it in 

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:12.639
 the title play box playstation 4 and xbox 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:14.410
 one in the same console ok a console 

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:15.910
 which is also portable and was something 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:17.470
 in which I wanted to talk to you on the day of 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:19.330
 today since if you are old 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:21.160
 subscribers and remember some videos 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:24.130
 what I did some time ago I had 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:26.830
 talked about the playbook good no no the 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:28.840
 playbox but if the xbox one idea 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:31.000
 portable playstation 4 as said 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:33.640
 user a very well-known engineer more 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.530
 that nothing in the scope of modification in 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:38.230
 carcasses and all this referring to the 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:40.210
 computation has created this console 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.399
 same way the link of this article is 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:45.010
 I'll leave them in the description so much 

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:46.480
 the video in which it is shown will 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:49.120
 be seeing then some 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:51.429
 images which is said console 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:54.159
 as they see it's called play box and it's a 

00:00:51.429 --> 00:00:56.499
 combination of playstation 4 and xbox one 

00:00:54.159 --> 00:00:58.089
 ok if there is something that can be claimed to 

00:00:56.499 --> 00:01:00.069
 the developers of consoles 

00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:02.019
 videogames is your inability to 

00:01:00.069 --> 00:01:04.629
 turn that experience into a 

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:06.640
 portable device no one can deny 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:10.030
 that the success of the game boy or place 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:13.990
 portable however said as what 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:16.360
 is offered in playstation 4 and xbox one ok 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:18.850
 tell me that to date not acquired 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.710
 the new generation of laptops because 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:22.930
 the truth that they were pretty good not to 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:25.030
 my nintendo I like but I do not know more 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:26.380
 as well as playstation or xbox the truth 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.119
 that would be something that would be enough 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.490
 well since today the console 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:33.250
 Sony's laptop is pretty bad since 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:35.390
 has a very low catalog and it 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:37.820
 many things are missing 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:40.220
 I have seen the console I am going to tell you what 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.659
 which includes the play box has all 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:44.960
 the functions that the two consoles bring 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:49.100
 factory dvd input bluray wifi 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:51.470
 input from hdmi and smart in hd my a 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.840
 vice monitor 22 inches and the 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:55.910
 housing that contains the two consoles the 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.820
 screen was developed on average with 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:01.490
 3d printers and material systems 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:04.430
 They are similar to those used by the boxes 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:06.710
 of both consoles which guarantees that 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:08.420
 the ventilation system does not suffer 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:10.030
 no overheating 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.440
 Obviously, also the engineer 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:15.380
 Saric has said that this is how it is 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:17.450
 creator he has revealed that obviously if 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:19.400
 put the two consoles to position the 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.390
 At the same time what is going to happen is that 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.519
 can burn you for a 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:24.739
 overheating I do not know if it's 

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:26.720
 now you can buy it or the still 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:28.220
 is generating them since I've seen that 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.440
 what the power button is doing 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:32.690
 of the Playstation 4 has a 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:35.989
 small false which does not allow to light 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:37.280
 the console since it generates a then 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:40.300
 simply one generates 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:42.220
 incompatibility no but you can 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:44.590
 learn perfect from the control 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:46.660
 connected to said console you 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:49.540
 tell me what you think about this I do not think 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:51.580
 you still can not know the prices anymore 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:54.550
 prices are under development 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:55.870
 several according to some variables one can 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:57.700
 send your own console to be 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.800
 personalized or you can ask it to be 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:02.020
 buy directly with the design of 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:03.820
 said console not the truth is something that 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:06.520
 it's super good more than anything nice 

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:08.200
 that will be the console I suppose if the 

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:11.230
 can change to other colors what I know 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:14.050
 I put it in blue with green or 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:16.600
 a more beautiful color because if you 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:20.380
 see how they generate the console they make it com 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:22.270
 Well basically 3d printers do not 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:23.710
 which allows all this and the 

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:25.720
 it's really fine I do not know if 

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:27.400
 What do you think about this and tell me what 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:31.390
 like to see me I would like 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:33.670
 basically that the company either xbox 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:36.070
 good microsoft or sony will dedicate to 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:37.780
 buy a project like that and you could 

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:39.700
 have in the comfort of your home not that 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:41.590
 just put a shell that 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.180
 have a monitor and you can play it and 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:44.980
 that includes the battery will not be something 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:47.290
 pretty good I think that 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:49.090
 something is missing that is revolution of 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:51.069
 all this system of video games 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:52.510
 laptops and the truth that would remain 

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:54.549
 pretty good so the description them 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:57.010
 I will leave both the article which I 

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:59.440
 I have read and am going to leave it 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:01.510
 simply what you doing the video in 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:03.610
 which is taught this console so 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:05.470
