using it for a while all of the buttons

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.160 
using it for a while all of the buttons
are<00:00:57.890> perfect<00:00:58.579> it<00:00:59.089> doesn't<00:00:59.300> mess<00:00:59.569> anything<00:00:59.929> up

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:00.170

camera<00:01:09.620> flash<00:01:09.979> and<00:01:10.340> speaker<00:01:11.090> so<00:01:12.020> it<00:01:12.890> the<00:01:13.280> case

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:13.490 
camera flash and speaker so it the case

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.030 
camera flash and speaker so it the case
works<00:01:14.030> good<00:01:14.300> and<00:01:14.870> then<00:01:15.229> you<00:01:15.470> would<00:01:15.620> just<00:01:15.740> put

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:16.040 
works good and then you would just put

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:22.289 
works good and then you would just put
this<00:01:16.159> hard<00:01:16.460> part<00:01:16.700> on<00:01:16.880> to<00:01:17.030> the<00:01:17.120> back<00:01:19.630> and<00:01:20.920> then

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:22.299 
this hard part on to the back and then

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:27.310 
this hard part on to the back and then
it's<00:01:23.299> on<00:01:23.479> so<00:01:24.759> this<00:01:25.759> case<00:01:26.060> does<00:01:26.570> have<00:01:26.869> two

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:27.320 
it's on so this case does have two

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:28.990 
it's on so this case does have two
letters<00:01:27.560> of<00:01:27.740> protection<00:01:27.860> it's<00:01:28.340> gotten<00:01:28.880> like

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.000 
letters of protection it's gotten like

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.109 
letters of protection it's gotten like
this<00:01:29.180> gel<00:01:29.899> stuff<00:01:30.229> here<00:01:30.649> and<00:01:30.799> then<00:01:31.579> I<00:01:31.850> don't

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:32.119 
this gel stuff here and then I don't

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:33.539 
this gel stuff here and then I don't
know<00:01:32.180> if<00:01:32.270> you<00:01:32.360> can<00:01:32.509> really<00:01:32.659> see<00:01:32.930> but<00:01:33.079> there's

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:33.549

there's e two layers of it there's the
two<00:01:39.380> layers<00:01:39.590> of<00:01:39.710> it<00:01:40.509> you<00:01:41.509> can<00:01:41.689> just<00:01:41.719> pop<00:01:42.110> out

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:42.320 
two layers of it you can just pop out

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.010 
two layers of it you can just pop out
this<00:01:43.219> is<00:01:43.430> hard<00:01:43.670> this<00:01:43.909> is<00:01:43.969> like<00:01:44.270> tempered

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.020 
this is hard this is like tempered

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.249 
this is hard this is like tempered
plastic<00:01:45.530> I<00:01:45.619> believe<00:01:45.859> and<00:01:46.630> then<00:01:47.630> we<00:01:47.719> have<00:01:47.869> just

00:01:48.249 --> 00:01:48.259 
plastic I believe and then we have just

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:51.849 
plastic I believe and then we have just
the<00:01:48.409> gel<00:01:48.649> mini<00:01:49.549> case<00:01:49.820> and<00:01:50.119> then<00:01:50.689> we<00:01:50.869> have<00:01:51.079> this

00:01:51.849 --> 00:01:51.859 
the gel mini case and then we have this

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:54.399 
the gel mini case and then we have this
which<00:01:52.280> as<00:01:52.549> you<00:01:53.240> probably<00:01:53.600> already<00:01:53.990> know<00:01:54.140> would

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:54.409 
which as you probably already know would

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:56.319 
which as you probably already know would
slide<00:01:54.649> onto<00:01:54.829> the<00:01:54.979> front<00:01:55.159> of<00:01:55.310> her<00:01:55.430> phone<00:01:55.640> so

00:01:56.319 --> 00:01:56.329 
slide onto the front of her phone so

00:01:56.329 --> 00:02:08.520 
slide onto the front of her phone so
let's<00:01:58.179> put<00:01:59.179> the<00:01:59.270> case<00:01:59.450> on<00:01:59.659> here<00:02:01.000> and
