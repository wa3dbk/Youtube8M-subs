alright guys um my first impression was

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:24.850 
alright guys um my first impression was
that<00:02:21.319> was<00:02:22.069> pretty<00:02:22.670> cool<00:02:22.970> um<00:02:23.569> definitely<00:02:24.560> one

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
that was pretty cool um definitely one

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:26.890 
that was pretty cool um definitely one
of<00:02:24.890> the<00:02:25.040> better<00:02:25.220> looking<00:02:25.489> kinect<00:02:25.970> games<00:02:26.209> even

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
of the better looking kinect games even

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:28.720 
of the better looking kinect games even
though<00:02:26.989> there<00:02:27.200> hasn't<00:02:27.319> been<00:02:27.440> that<00:02:27.650> many<00:02:27.800> but

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
though there hasn't been that many but

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.570 
though there hasn't been that many but
some<00:02:28.900> third<00:02:29.900> third<00:02:30.650> party<00:02:31.040> games<00:02:31.310> aren't

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 
some third third party games aren't

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:33.699 
some third third party games aren't
usually<00:02:31.760> the<00:02:32.090> best<00:02:32.629> but<00:02:33.080> that<00:02:33.349> that<00:02:33.620> actually

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:33.709 
usually the best but that that actually

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:35.920 
usually the best but that that actually
pretty<00:02:34.160> good<00:02:34.340> graphics<00:02:34.819> wise<00:02:35.000> and<00:02:35.360> gameplay

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
pretty good graphics wise and gameplay

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:39.520 
pretty good graphics wise and gameplay
was<00:02:36.140> um<00:02:36.440> I<00:02:36.920> mean<00:02:37.760> the<00:02:38.510> head-butting<00:02:38.900> kicking

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
was um I mean the head-butting kicking

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.350 
was um I mean the head-butting kicking
punching<00:02:40.220> that<00:02:40.549> was<00:02:40.670> pretty<00:02:40.849> cool<00:02:41.030> and<00:02:41.209> then

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 
punching that was pretty cool and then

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:42.550 
punching that was pretty cool and then
the<00:02:41.480> throwing<00:02:41.750> the<00:02:41.900> sword<00:02:42.140> at<00:02:42.230> the<00:02:42.319> end<00:02:42.440> that

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
the throwing the sword at the end that

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.119 
the throwing the sword at the end that
just<00:02:42.769> topped<00:02:43.640> it<00:02:43.790> off<00:02:43.910> for<00:02:44.209> me<00:02:44.239> as<00:02:45.019> you<00:02:45.769> can<00:02:45.980> see

00:02:46.119 --> 00:02:46.129 
just topped it off for me as you can see

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:47.680 
just topped it off for me as you can see
on<00:02:46.220> the<00:02:46.310> screen<00:02:46.459> right<00:02:46.700> now<00:02:46.760> it<00:02:46.880> says<00:02:47.030> Crytek

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 
on the screen right now it says Crytek

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:49.930 
on the screen right now it says Crytek
so<00:02:48.530> obviously<00:02:49.340> that<00:02:49.489> means<00:02:49.549> that<00:02:49.790> it's

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940 
so obviously that means that it's

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:51.670 
so obviously that means that it's
developed<00:02:50.510> and<00:02:50.720> probably<00:02:51.230> published<00:02:51.590> by

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
developed and probably published by

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.610 
developed and probably published by
Crytek<00:02:52.190> so<00:02:53.030> um<00:02:53.390> I'm<00:02:53.989> pretty<00:02:54.260> excited<00:02:54.349> about

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
Crytek so um I'm pretty excited about

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:56.949 
Crytek so um I'm pretty excited about
that<00:02:54.920> actually<00:02:55.130> they<00:02:55.700> made<00:02:55.910> crisis<00:02:56.420> one<00:02:56.690> and

00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:56.959 
that actually they made crisis one and

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:00.009 
that actually they made crisis one and
two<00:02:57.230> and<00:02:57.790> I<00:02:58.790> love<00:02:59.150> the<00:02:59.239> both<00:02:59.390> games<00:02:59.690> they<00:02:59.959> were

00:03:00.009 --> 00:03:00.019 
two and I love the both games they were

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:01.900
