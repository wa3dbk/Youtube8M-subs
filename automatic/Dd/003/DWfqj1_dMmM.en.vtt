00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
 hello you love it is again 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.690
 as far as the month is coming to an end 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:08.040
 and that's why it would be time for 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.080
 a favorite video 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.969
 I just want to give you that today 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.880
 I show products last month 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.529
 like to and often used and will 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.779
 let's say we start now 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.670
 First of all I have a leaf from here 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.490
 mac and that is the color 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.930
 pinnschmidt I love the general 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.640
 mac blanches because super good 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.170
 pigmented in super long hold and 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.949
 can be used super 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:35.070
 yes this color here yes it is such a 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:37.649
 red pink color and i would say this 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.180
 Color really fits every eye make 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.460
 up if you do not know which 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.140
 blanched should then wear this 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.239
 because he just always fits and 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.469
 that's why it's just a favorite of 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.239
 me and I have this past month 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:51.690
 worn very often 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:54.329
 and I carry it on one today too 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.649
 studio finish concealer owned by mac 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.210
 I have been for a long time 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.070
 however, I have it somehow 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.140
 Last month so new for me 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.969
 I hope for the kathrin 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.719
 Meat cream used around pimples 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.630
 cover 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.570
 but last month I have this 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.310
 concealer used again because I think 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:13.439
 this is really one of the distance 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.450
 best concealer for pimples and redness 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.100
 cover for the eyes is then 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.150
 not so suitable because he is not there 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.430
 settle wrinkles 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.500
 but he really covers pimples very well 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.390
 From the color fits perfectly with mine 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.850
 he skin tone nice and creamy, it can be 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.100
 already a work i love the easy 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.979
 It looks like a product that I have every one 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.869
 day since I have it and I have 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.390
 Never had a better product for 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:40.770
 my eyebrows and that anastasia 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:42.450
 beverly hills in the color raging i have 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.360
 yes ever made a video about it too 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.829
 to the parade of a valley me 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.630
 Link this only under the infobox 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:50.729
 and i will infobox you down too 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.590
 times yes, the product probably link that 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:56.729
 heer can get except at anastacia 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:59.040
 beverly hills or very direct and yes 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:01.010
 what should i say i love that 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.150
 simply the color one fits 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:03.470
 perfect as a hair color 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:06.590
 or to a eyebrow 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:09.920
 color and I can not describe 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:12.110
 like so, he is just so incredible 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.300
 Well the next product I have 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:17.840
 someday found in a flat 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:20.660
 and I do not remember where I have it 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.720
 And it is this hand cream from here 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:26.110
 the brand htc nature 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:28.640
 It is the aloe vera hand care creams 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:30.320
 natural cosmetics and I have them 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.820
 used when traveling with my grandma 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:33.500
 was also used and she found 

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:35.750
 she was so happy that she wanted them 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.130
 and then I have dm rossmann and such 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:40.130
 but what are you looking for nowhere 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:42.260
 found and it had at the end of then 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:44.600
 Parents for you ordered these handles 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.410
 very cheap costs five euro 45 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:49.130
 approximately 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:51.290
 there are 75 milliliters in it and it lays 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:52.580
 just so incredibly good i lay it 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:56.420
 just below in the infobox 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:57.800
 So that's it so it's a finished one 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.670
 Hand cream but very fast 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.650
 move in 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:02.360
 that means you have a quick draw 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:03.170
 no greasy hands after a short 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:05.510
 more time 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:07.790
 but hands are still very long 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:09.590
 Well kept so really really long 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:11.660
 yes i can describe the very chic 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:13.430
 somehow but she has me for example 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:15.590
 Also helped very well because I have 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:17.690
 namely always between the nail 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:20.300
 very dry skin and on the other hand has great 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:21.620
 Well helped and for the price i can 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:23.209
 do not complain and that's why I had to 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:25.430
 this hand cream simply necessarily 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:27.650
 show it and then I have one more 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:30.769
 favorites for you in the field of food 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:33.980
 namely these duplo bars 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:36.950
 there are two years so me 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:38.420
 I do not always know it's summer 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:41.840
 In the summer I believe such a limited art 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:43.340
 edition and full of milk I focus 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.320
 really does not like that at all 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:47.570
 taste of coconut and that's why 

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:49.160
 I know rule never tried 

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:51.350
 So many people said this year 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:53.750
 have that bacon try too delicious times 

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:56.720
 and i bought that myself and 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:58.489
 tasted and yes they taste very good 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:00.739
 that is actually like a normal one 

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:02.930
 duplo that then up such a liquid 

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:04.990
 Coconut cream is in it and that tastes good 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:06.910
 it can hurt so incredibly 

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:08.560
 as long as they still exist I wanted you 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:11.020
 the show and look at you 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:12.430
 make sure to try it and try it 

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:14.590
 next i want you a favorite 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:17.709
 Show that I am wearing namely my 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:20.200
 t shirt that's what I'm fine 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:23.080
 bought and I like this imprint 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:24.910
 just totally like and also this gray 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:28.000
 I like washing very well 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:30.310
 and yes it was just as cheap as it was 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.290
 frank is as well and I just have it 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:35.920
 I love to wear it very much 

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:37.540
 casual max very much like a black one 

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:40.750
 jeans and a black leather jacket 

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:43.510
 and thought that shows you just as well 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:44.680
 I have a few days ago 

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:48.100
 first time 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:50.380
 yes people i know i am a late bloomer 

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:53.230
 i have been to the first in the last few days 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:55.900
 seen the tribute of panem 

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:58.560
 I have part 1 in a day then 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:01.540
 looked and then found it okay 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:03.780
 As an essayist I think the movie is 

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:07.810
 totally had and I just have 

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:09.550
 much more is presented to us so 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:12.700
 I expected much more action 

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:14.800
 rather drama much more power 

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:16.450
 I was so a little lacking in the 

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:18.220
 first part but still I have 

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:20.470
 the next day part 2 and part 3 

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:22.510
 looked at and I have to say part 2 is 

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:25.390
 my absolute favorite part of mine 

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:27.610
 god part 2 was so incredibly good part 3 

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:29.980
 was also better than 1 but then well 

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:32.830
 not quite as strong as part 2 

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:34.750
 although the end of part 3 is totally blatant 

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:38.460
 i was great peter venn and 

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:43.060
 that's why it has me a bit 

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:44.710
 angry and I thought I nee 

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:46.870
 Just tell you that was in for 

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:49.300
 a favorite finally a movie 

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:52.150
 to have seen that I liked 

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:53.440
 because it's been a lot in the last few weeks 

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:55.570
 been very in the case 

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:58.570
 and my last favorite for this one 

00:05:55.570 --> 00:06:01.300
 month is an app we would be up 

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:06.130
 instagram probably knows 

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:08.380
 already i have nice around now 

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:10.860
 my god i have the app already 

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:13.180
 somehow downloaded four times 

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:16.210
 try to understand them and have them 

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:19.690
 then deleted again but after sophie 

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:23.050
 many bloggers and youtubers I like 

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:25.150
 look or like to read snapshot 

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:27.009
 I wanted to see us net 

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:28.960
 and just made me more times with 

00:06:27.009 --> 00:06:30.970
 snapshot deals and has google like 

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:33.639
 everything works and then I have it 

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:34.560
 understood and is easy every day 

00:06:33.639 --> 00:06:39.310
 used 

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:41.710
 I am absolutely addicted to snapshot it 

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:44.080
 is just such an app you may 

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:46.090
 be ugly when that shit babbles 

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:48.400
 No idea is not interested 

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:51.699

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:58.930
 to look at you or whenever you write 

00:06:56.199 --> 00:07:01.479
 to answer and and and and because of that 

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:03.490
