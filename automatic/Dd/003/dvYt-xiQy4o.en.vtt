00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.130
 in this video I'll show you how 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.779
 prepare pina colada ice cream and 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.269
 I want to send a greeting to the mari of 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.950
 tree that is a friend and follower of 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.880
 facebook and has always been very 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:26.840
 pending all publications 

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:26.840
 [Music] 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:33.630
 we will need a medium pineapple 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.400
 will buy pineapple in pieces because he knows 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.190
 much cheaper to buy so buy 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:40.739
 a whole pineapple apart the counterpart 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.230
 and I can tell if it 's mature or not 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.550
 what is called honey pineapple 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.650
 I prefer to buy this one because it's more 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.600
 sweet the pineapple in general does not seem 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:52.589
 which is very acidic we occupy a liter of 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:55.800
 milk we take coconut milk the size 

00:00:52.589 --> 00:00:58.949
 they need at least 250 milliliters this 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.780
 container brings 500 milliliters but with this 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.360
 I'm going to make the ice cream in two 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.309
 chances are I will use half for 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:08.250
 this time and I will save half 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:11.070
 to do on another occasion also 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.020
 we occupy sugar sugar not yet 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.680
 we know exactly how much we are going to 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:18.570
 need can be two or three cups 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:21.060
 depending on the water that pineapple gives us 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.610
 because I'm going to split the pineapple and I'm going 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.740
 to liquefy be with enough something that does not 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.950
 come out very thick so we can 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:31.350
 strain well and depending on the water that 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.550
 let's get it going to be the sugar we're going 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.730
 to put in 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:38.310
 a cup of sugar for every liter of 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:40.800
 liquid that we are going to prepare but 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:43.050
 until we see how much habanos given the 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.480
 pineapple let's find out how much sugar 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:49.969
 Lets put 

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:49.969
 [Music] 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:02:13.510
 i 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:02:16.540
 [Music] 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:18.670
 since I peeled and cut the pineapple into pieces 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:21.280
 that are not too big for the 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:23.260
 blender do not try hard I'll 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.840
 liquefy in two parts so as not to 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.670
 well here I 'm going to put a liter of 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:31.170
 water approximately and this I'm going to 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.170
 leave to put another liter 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:46.950
 and now we're going to put it in a 

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:46.950
 container passing it through a colander 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:52.330
 I pretty big container region 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:54.760
 because I'm already seeing that they 're going to 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:56.980
 come out like two liters of predatory water 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:59.440
 and apart the liter of milk then 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:02.560
 he occupied a container that fits me so 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:05.470
 minus about three liters of liquid here 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:08.830
 what they have to do is measure this 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:10.990
 water to know what quantities I o more 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:13.060
 least I know how much I need 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:15.790
 measure it but we will measure it so that 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:17.739
 You see, here I have a jar that 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:20.290
 has the measures that has a liter two 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:22.180
 milliliters three liters this I'm going to 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:25.630
 measure to be sure how many liters 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:27.940
 are these are two and a half liters here 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:30.550
 you can decide if they leave half 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:33.580
 liter to make a fresh half for 

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:36.790
 take or want to use everything I go to 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:38.260
 use two liters nothing else if I want 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:40.300
 leave a newspaper to make me a 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:42.670
 fresh water and take the vast steppe 

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:45.290
 this warmth then I will put the 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:49.329
 liters here nothing more 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:49.329
 Now I'm going to put the liter of milk 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:55.410
 [Music] 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:04:00.560
 and as I already know it's three liters of 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:04:00.560
 liquid I'm going to put three cups of sugar 

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:06.640
 Y 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:09.490
 [Music] 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:12.030
 I do not much measured rates now I use 

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:15.430
 the rates that were used to drink the coffee 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:17.230
 I do not put very good rates if you 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:19.450
 they have the measuring station with the 

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:21.970
 reason I tell you now but generally not 

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:25.840
 we have measuring cases the often all 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:28.600
 have I do I have 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:30.910
 then authors sugar cups here 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:36.130
 I have my measuring cup here I'm going to measure 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:49.270
 with the rate so that you can see that 

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:51.010
 it is necessary to have the publishers and now 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:53.940
 I'm just going to measure here in the cup that 

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:53.940
 put yourself and me not 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:58.990
 and then you can see it's a cup that does not 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:02.200
 it's very full so this way is 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:04.620
 how I measure the quantities and now I'm going 

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:07.510
 to stir until the 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:09.840
 tape and integrate well all 

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:09.840
 ingredients 

00:05:12.249 --> 00:05:17.330
 since it completely dissolved 

00:05:14.809 --> 00:05:19.309
 sugar we are going to fill the sachets that 

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:22.309
 we had shown and that I always 

00:05:19.309 --> 00:05:26.899
 ask for this bag the measure that 

00:05:22.309 --> 00:05:30.159
 is 8 x 26 the brand these are the gps that 

00:05:26.899 --> 00:05:32.240
 gets tired of the moisture mark that this 

00:05:30.159 --> 00:05:34.520
 but if you do not have these bags 

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:36.319
 can use any other measure not 

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:39.289
 matter is the measurement of the liquid that 

00:05:36.319 --> 00:05:41.599
 let's put this I will fill 

00:05:39.289 --> 00:05:44.119
 sachets with this same rate with which 

00:05:41.599 --> 00:05:45.740
 they measured sugar and we're going to make a 

00:05:44.119 --> 00:05:47.209
 amount of this cake that is not very 

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:49.430
 full and that's the amount we're going 

00:05:47.209 --> 00:05:51.229
 to put the bags with this amount 

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:53.689
 I have to leave about 

00:05:51.229 --> 00:05:56.629
 16 ice creams I hope a little more 

00:05:53.689 --> 00:05:57.919
 others I will fill my bag and today 

00:05:56.629 --> 00:06:00.229
 so I show them so they can see 

00:05:57.919 --> 00:06:02.559
 when they came out to me you already know the 

00:06:00.229 --> 00:06:05.119
 way not how to tell them in fact many 

00:06:02.559 --> 00:06:07.430
 ice cream videos and well you know 

00:06:05.119 --> 00:06:09.409
 you how do they hold on to this 

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:11.769
 the measure and we are going to put it to the 

00:06:09.409 --> 00:06:11.769
 sachet 

00:06:16.449 --> 00:06:21.090
 since we have the team we are going to 

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:21.090
 make a knot 

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:26.910
 the knot does not have to go very close to 

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:29.760
 liquid has to go higher so that 

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:32.220
 so that it appears that it is bigger and 

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:34.770
 now freeze it freeze from this 

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:36.360
 shape to the side so that it appears to be 

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:38.580
 bigger the plane and it's going to freeze 

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:41.370
 I'm going to keep coming tapes myself 

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:44.670
 will choose the samples and with this amount 

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:45.480
 of teeth came out 15 degrees as a 

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:47.340
 heap 

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:49.860
 I am very happy now I am going to 

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:51.300
 put in the freezer to freeze and 

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:53.250
 I can not wait for confirmation 

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:53.880
 to enjoy them and for the same 

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:56.400
 freeze 

00:06:53.880 --> 00:07:00.480
 I'm going to enjoy this rich pineapple that 

00:06:56.400 --> 00:07:02.970
 I prepared in the initial 

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:06.720
 and that's how we are left frozen 

00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:09.090
 the pina colada ice cream is here the 

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:10.710
 pineapple like the pineapple pulp went a 

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:12.960
 little bit up and in the part of 

00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:15.390
 down a little bit the water 

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:18.180
 this is normal if they are left like this is not 

00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:20.150
 worry here they will be left but of 

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:36.839
 it tastes delicious all the time 

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:36.839
