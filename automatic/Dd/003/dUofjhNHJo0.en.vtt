 thanks for coming back to my channel now 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:09.059
 I'll be talking a little about the 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.910
 different skin tones that is very 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.950
 important and we can use it a lot to 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.960
 know what kind of base what kind of powder 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.480
 up what kind of clothes and hair color 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:22.070
 use to make us stand out in our 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.070
 beauty then what do you want and 

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:32.489
 two girls then as I told them is 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.950
 know the skin tone is very very 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.840
 necessary and I'm not talking about the tone 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.600
 that are looking up but the one 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.540
 it's under our skin that that's not 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:47.550
 change, I'm going to give you three methods of 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:50.039
 how to know what skin tone are the 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:54.510
 first it is the doll's they are going to look 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:56.570
 Daylight if your veins are color 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:00.500
 green Blue 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:05.239
 or green blue if your veins are green 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:09.170
 like mine are warm tones if your 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:12.229
 veins are blue are cold tone and if your 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:15.100
 veins are the two solver wishes or are 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:19.009
 neutral tone 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:22.310
 the second method is practically 

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:23.479
 grab a silver jewel and a 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.420
 golden jewel 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:28.729
 now ask you and objectively 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:31.220
 choose which one looks best in 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:35.149
 your skin if you answer silver you are tone 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:40.250
 cold and if you answer golden you're tone 

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:43.039
 warm and the third method has to 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:46.039
 grab a card or blush color 

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:48.020
 Orange and one pink color washes her face 

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:50.960
 very well with soap they leave it 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:53.570
 clean in front of a mirror 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:56.780
 Put on a blush or cardboard what 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:59.750
 have orange color and a pink color 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:02.510
 which highlights its beauty more 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:05.360
 which is the one that decreases their 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:07.670
 imperfections if they are warm tones like 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:10.520
 me and she puts on the pink to see her 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:12.470
 imperfections look up even more ok and 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:15.080
 when they change to the orange color their 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:17.000
 imperfections like that diminish and 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:20.000
 they do not look so much then this is the 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.830
 importance of choosing not your color 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.410
 favorite but the color that you really 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:27.290
 is left to know what kind of tone you are and 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:29.870
 already with that I give you the three methods that 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:32.570
