00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
x 14 11 yeah basically an 11 x 14 it's

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.490 
x 14 11 yeah basically an 11 x 14 it's
actually<00:01:42.930> 11<00:01:43.890> point<00:01:44.250> 75<00:01:44.820> x<00:01:45.299> 14<00:01:45.750> but<00:01:46.049> it's<00:01:46.320> close

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
actually 11 point 75 x 14 but it's close

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:52.609 
actually 11 point 75 x 14 but it's close
enough<00:01:48.200> this<00:01:49.200> wind<00:01:49.439> power<00:01:49.649> sketchbook<00:01:51.619> the

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
enough this wind power sketchbook the

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.800 
enough this wind power sketchbook the
cycles<00:01:53.070> which<00:01:53.250> is<00:01:53.399> good<00:01:53.610> maybe<00:01:54.299> wind<00:01:54.600> power

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
cycles which is good maybe wind power

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.480 
cycles which is good maybe wind power
but<00:01:55.259> just<00:01:55.610> fantastic<00:01:56.610> and<00:01:57.530> not<00:01:58.530> really<00:01:58.740> done<00:01:59.100> a

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
but just fantastic and not really done a

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.039 
but just fantastic and not really done a
whole<00:01:59.820> lot<00:01:59.880> in<00:02:00.240> here<00:02:00.540> yet<00:02:01.409> I<00:02:02.659> really<00:02:03.659> like<00:02:03.840> this

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
whole lot in here yet I really like this

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.390 
whole lot in here yet I really like this
on<00:02:04.320> that's<00:02:05.009> not<00:02:05.250> finished

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:06.400 
on that's not finished

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:11.220 
on that's not finished
but<00:02:07.180> I<00:02:07.500> like<00:02:08.500> it<00:02:08.530> it's<00:02:08.830> really<00:02:09.220> smooth<00:02:10.230> fairly

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
but I like it it's really smooth fairly

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:14.070 
but I like it it's really smooth fairly
light<00:02:11.560> paper<00:02:12.000> but<00:02:13.000> it's<00:02:13.480> okay<00:02:13.780> because<00:02:13.810> I'm

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
light paper but it's okay because I'm

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.200 
light paper but it's okay because I'm
not<00:02:14.230> trying<00:02:14.650> to<00:02:14.680> use<00:02:14.920> you<00:02:15.250> know<00:02:15.340> markers<00:02:15.970> or

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:16.210 
not trying to use you know markers or

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:18.270 
not trying to use you know markers or
anything<00:02:16.570> like<00:02:16.600> that<00:02:16.750> here<00:02:17.320> it's<00:02:17.890> basically

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
anything like that here it's basically

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.180 
anything like that here it's basically
just<00:02:18.570> sketching<00:02:19.570> and<00:02:19.900> coloring<00:02:20.860> with<00:02:20.980> some

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
just sketching and coloring with some

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:26.790 
just sketching and coloring with some
code<00:02:21.370> pencils<00:02:21.850> so<00:02:22.230> it<00:02:23.230> works<00:02:24.900> so<00:02:25.900> I<00:02:25.930> guess<00:02:26.200> if

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:26.800 
code pencils so it works so I guess if
