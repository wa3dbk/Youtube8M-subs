00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.799
 hello here is just about everything ebooks.de 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.690
 and today we 'll take a look 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:08.670
 culinary on the right side in the 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.219
 comparison to the turin sparkle on the 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:13.590
 left side 

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:15.750
 we limit ourselves to this short one 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.060
 overview of the hardware of the two 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.160
 Devices that they are software technical 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.510
 barely distinguish 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:24.750
 So let's start with the specifications 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.880
 at the tu linus just luck will be 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:31.019
 well-known girl display with a 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:32.640
 resolution of 1024 x 768 pixels 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.850
 tourino as on the right side 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:39.260
 about a new display also with 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:41.969
 a resolution of 1024 x 768 pixels 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:44.250
 the operation is done on both devices 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:47.879
 via a touchscreen is at 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:52.860
 Tourino Vision Capacitive at the Turin 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:56.520
 sparkle infrared the difference is here 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:01:00.149
 clearly visible the translucent Tourino has 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.920
 via a screen of the 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:05.539
 relatively fit sitting in the housing 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.539
 due to the touchscreen technology 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:14.010
 whereas the tonino vision has a 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:18.720
 plane surface has that is the 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:20.960
 second e book reader with this look 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:28.080
 with this design the first is the 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:29.970
 cobra at the optics has a lot 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:33.990
 changed but the tourino how beautiful is 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:36.570
 still recognizable as a torino device 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:39.479
 So that's mainly because of the 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.610
 brown accents your edge resp 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:44.100
 the back side is very similar 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:50.100
 looks very similar to the two 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:53.369
 devices and of course the home button 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:56.520
 bz design of the home buttons is at 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:59.689
 turiner sparkle with a physical button 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:03.840
 a quick point and the tourino vision 

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:06.619
 is it a capacitive button without 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.619
 haptic feedback 

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:18.780
 as you can see the theater display 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:21.660
 The turin boy makes for a 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:25.320
 better contrast of the tour - one 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:29.240
 Comparison looks a little dull of the 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:31.350
 difference is depending on 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:34.350
 illuminance so relationship after 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:36.540
 was ambient light to different degrees 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:39.180
 it is not always easy to see 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:41.550
 are primarily from the lighting 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.470
 The environment was there too 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:44.960
 hard the difference on camera 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:51.510
 hold 

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:54.390
 I hope you can see it here 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:58.080
 Here, at least this way 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:03:01.200
 you see there is a difference in it 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:07.020
 the brightness backgrounds of the 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:08.760
 screens and thus also the 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:10.940
 contrast ratio for that 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.840
 Contrast ratio in tool innovation 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:14.760
 is a little better 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:18.180
 the difference is not 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:20.580
 as big as zum kinde data was then 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:24.000
 the kindle app award has one 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:26.640
 Capacitive touchscreen without visible 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.980
 sensor lattice when used for genomic and 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.900
 that can be from the homepage 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:33.150
 look is a very fine sensor 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:36.420
 grid over the over the display 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:39.270
 what is distributed is the screen 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:42.870
 a little darker would have to be so 

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:46.440
 bc elversberg to be a sparkle and 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:48.180
 concrete case is then one more 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:51.620
 not mind that the contrast ratio 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:53.400
 visibly better on the device than the 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:55.970
 turin translucent 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:59.310
 that means the readability is better 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:00.959
 Now we want to add the devices 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:02.850
 compare darkness are the 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:05.070
 Compare lighting in the dark 

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:07.560
 I will be able to break down completely and we will 

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:09.540
 We'll be back soon 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:11.220
 a darkened room with the to be 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:12.170
 no as on the right side and 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:14.540
 the Turinians 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:16.040
 on the left side as you can see her immediately 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:18.320
 can see the two differ 

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:20.780
 devices in their lighting very clearly 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:22.180
 the domino as on the right 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:24.350
 page with a clear white 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:27.410
 yellowish light so a warmer 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:29.360
 Tint and the turiner sparkle with one 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:31.660
 very bluish shade 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:33.620
 So I personally like that 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:35.870
 dynamic here much better in 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:39.500
 this respect, that makes my 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:41.419
 eyes much more pleasant the lighting 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:44.150
 even that he is the uniformity of 

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:45.650
 Lighting is not perfect so here 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:46.790
 there are still two devices 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:49.370
 Point of concern 

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:51.919
 That's how we get to eurovision first 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:54.680
 new device in the bottom of the screen 

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:57.200
 is very clearly visible in brightness 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:59.090
 Run one to two 

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:02.540
 centimeters play transit and their 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:05.240
 a screen of light the ears 

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:07.850
 not really far in the picture in one 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:11.300
 socially something less disturbs the bottom 

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:14.030
 It does not do too much 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:18.710
 in the main area where the text 

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:22.580
 appears is the course with are the 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:25.450
 brightness very even than that 

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:28.789
 I like that very much on the 

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:30.560
 margins there is a very slight 

00:05:28.789 --> 00:05:34.000
 However, shadowing does not occur 

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:38.240
 too much in weight so do not mind 

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:39.830
 because regiebetrieb we come to the tourino 

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:41.539
 Shine so here it looks a little 

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:43.340
 otherwise it's especially at the top 

00:05:41.539 --> 00:05:46.660
 screen edge to brightness gradient too 

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:48.590
 look down a bit 

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:51.310
 weakened, the device is clearly 

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:54.500
 more contemplative than above where it a little 

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:57.200
 neutral acts so I like that 

00:05:54.500 --> 00:06:00.729
 then, as in any case, better that way 

00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:03.470
 is not over the entire screen 

00:06:00.729 --> 00:06:06.160
 such a brightness course visible 

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:09.289
 relationships available 

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:10.880
 next to the sparkle of the clear up here 

00:06:09.289 --> 00:06:15.260
 visible there are also at the 

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:18.490
 margins a light 

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:20.510
 paying brightness course of 

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:21.860
 a little worse that the 

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:23.090
 so shadow here is exactly that 

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:27.800
 reverse the case 

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:29.419
 innovation at the bottom of the screen 

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:31.580
 It looks better then again 

00:06:29.419 --> 00:06:35.120
 the tourino has to shine something 

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:36.770
 evenly lit what the 

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:38.479
 Contrast of the two devices is concerned 

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:41.419
 There are no big differences 

00:06:38.479 --> 00:06:43.460
 So the new display technology makes itself 

00:06:41.419 --> 00:06:47.750
 not really in absolute darkness 

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:49.520
 paid and the light guides before 

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:50.169
 does not seem much better here 

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:53.540
 his 

00:06:50.169 --> 00:06:56.479
 So you can see the turbine seem 

00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:58.419
 Contrast does not vary greatly 

00:06:56.479 --> 00:07:00.470
 with a free eye , this is barely perceptible 

00:06:58.419 --> 00:07:02.870
 So here would be more in any case 

00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:04.580
 been was like show other devices 

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:06.080
 of course, to say underline 

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:07.270
 that both devices continue to be very good 

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:10.250
 are readable 

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:13.130
 So that's not a broken leg right now though 

00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:15.610
 it was definitely better who was there 

00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:17.810
 we are already at the end again 

00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:19.910
 Underline is to say that the 

00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:22.520
 domino vision the better device is so 

00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:24.350
 Here you have already put many 

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:25.630
 reformed is perfect, however 

00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:26.870
 not that their second 

00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:28.880
 potential for improvement 

00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:32.510
 in my eyes he is the extra price of 

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:37.100
 30 euro definitely worth turiner 

00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:38.960
 owner is the question of whether to piece 

00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:39.950
 obviously much harder too 

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:41.450
 answer 

00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:44.360
 So everyone has to do that for themselves 

00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:47.289
 it's best to still choose the devices 

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:51.560
 compare times in the shop 

00:07:47.289 --> 00:07:52.880
 otherwise if you choose before the election 

00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:55.849
 I would like the two devices 

00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:57.010
 surcharge of 30 euros in any case 

00:07:55.849 --> 00:07:59.870
 pay 

00:07:57.010 --> 00:08:03.310
 yes that was it too thank you for 

00:07:59.870 --> 00:08:03.310
 watch and see you next video
