00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:23.020 
way that my college schedule set up a

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:24.480 
way that my college schedule set up a
three<00:01:23.350> subject<00:01:23.650> notebook<00:01:23.890> is<00:01:23.980> good<00:01:24.280> for<00:01:24.460> me

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:24.490 
three subject notebook is good for me

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:26.130 
three subject notebook is good for me
and<00:01:24.760> then<00:01:24.850> use<00:01:25.030> one<00:01:25.240> subject<00:01:25.510> I<00:01:25.780> can<00:01:25.930> use<00:01:26.050> on

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:26.140 
and then use one subject I can use on

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:27.780 
and then use one subject I can use on
other<00:01:26.290> days<00:01:26.590> but<00:01:26.890> it's<00:01:27.370> just<00:01:27.550> this<00:01:27.610> really

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:27.790 
other days but it's just this really

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:29.640 
other days but it's just this really
pretty<00:01:27.970> teal<00:01:28.390> color<00:01:28.750> and<00:01:29.110> I<00:01:29.260> thought<00:01:29.440> it<00:01:29.530> went

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:29.650 
pretty teal color and I thought it went

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:31.230 
pretty teal color and I thought it went
well<00:01:29.770> with<00:01:30.160> the<00:01:30.250> Hello<00:01:30.460> Kitty<00:01:30.550> notebook<00:01:31.090> and

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:31.240 
well with the Hello Kitty notebook and

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.420 
well with the Hello Kitty notebook and
also<00:01:31.630> match<00:01:31.900> my<00:01:32.320> planner<00:01:32.710> that<00:01:32.950> I<00:01:33.010> picked<00:01:33.280> up

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:33.430 
also match my planner that I picked up

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:35.640 
also match my planner that I picked up
this<00:01:34.240> is<00:01:34.420> like<00:01:34.540> the<00:01:34.660> perfect<00:01:34.840> size<00:01:35.200> it<00:01:35.410> can<00:01:35.440> fit

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:35.650 
this is like the perfect size it can fit

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:37.320 
this is like the perfect size it can fit
in<00:01:35.740> my<00:01:35.830> bag<00:01:36.040> but<00:01:36.250> I<00:01:36.310> could<00:01:36.460> still<00:01:36.580> write<00:01:36.970> in<00:01:37.150> it

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:37.330 
in my bag but I could still write in it

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:38.790 
in my bag but I could still write in it
what<00:01:37.660> I<00:01:37.720> really<00:01:37.900> like<00:01:38.050> about<00:01:38.080> this<00:01:38.320> platter<00:01:38.650> is

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:38.800 
what I really like about this platter is

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:41.610 
what I really like about this platter is
that<00:01:39.070> it<00:01:39.160> has<00:01:39.510> spots<00:01:40.510> for<00:01:40.810> each<00:01:40.990> day<00:01:41.350> so<00:01:41.410> you

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:41.620 
that it has spots for each day so you

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:43.020 
that it has spots for each day so you
can<00:01:41.680> write<00:01:41.860> your<00:01:42.040> homework<00:01:42.520> or<00:01:42.670> you<00:01:42.820> have<00:01:42.910> to

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:43.030 
can write your homework or you have to

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:45.510 
can write your homework or you have to
do<00:01:43.120> that<00:01:43.270> day<00:01:43.450> then<00:01:43.750> it<00:01:43.840> also<00:01:44.020> has<00:01:44.520> the

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:45.520 
do that day then it also has the

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.610 
do that day then it also has the
calendar<00:01:46.210> like<00:01:46.510> this<00:01:46.780> so<00:01:46.930> you<00:01:47.020> can<00:01:47.050> see<00:01:47.409> the

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:47.620 
calendar like this so you can see the

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:50.700 
calendar like this so you can see the
whole<00:01:47.800> month<00:01:48.190> and<00:01:48.570> just<00:01:49.570> you<00:01:50.380> know<00:01:50.470> look<00:01:50.620> at

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:50.710 
whole month and just you know look at

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:52.350 
whole month and just you know look at
everything<00:01:50.890> at<00:01:51.040> once<00:01:51.220> I<00:01:51.430> like<00:01:51.640> that<00:01:51.850> because

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:52.360 
everything at once I like that because

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:53.250 
everything at once I like that because
there's<00:01:52.659> no<00:01:52.780> way<00:01:52.870> you<00:01:52.930> can<00:01:53.020> write<00:01:53.170> your

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:53.260 
there's no way you can write your

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:54.930 
there's no way you can write your
homework<00:01:53.590> in<00:01:53.710> this<00:01:53.860> little<00:01:54.159> spot<00:01:54.370> so<00:01:54.820> it's

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.470 
anything like this before I used to have
like<00:02:46.140> index<00:02:46.769> cards<00:02:47.129> around<00:02:47.549> like<00:02:47.730> a<00:02:47.819> spiral<00:02:48.180> so

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
like index cards around like a spiral so

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:49.550 
like index cards around like a spiral so
you<00:02:48.569> can<00:02:48.690> flip<00:02:48.900> through<00:02:49.019> them<00:02:49.170> but<00:02:49.290> this<00:02:49.410> is

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
you can flip through them but this is

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.140 
you can flip through them but this is
even<00:02:49.799> better<00:02:50.040> because<00:02:50.220> you<00:02:50.549> can<00:02:50.579> add<00:02:50.910> new

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
even better because you can add new

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:52.940 
even better because you can add new
cards<00:02:51.690> and<00:02:51.959> they<00:02:52.319> have<00:02:52.440> different<00:02:52.620> sized

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.130 
cards and they have different sized
rings<00:02:53.310> depending<00:02:53.940> on<00:02:54.120> how<00:02:54.660> many<00:02:54.720> cards<00:02:55.049> you

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
rings depending on how many cards you

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:56.479 
rings depending on how many cards you
need<00:02:55.290> to<00:02:55.349> put<00:02:55.500> in<00:02:55.620> there<00:02:55.769> so<00:02:56.010> this<00:02:56.220> is<00:02:56.340> perfect
