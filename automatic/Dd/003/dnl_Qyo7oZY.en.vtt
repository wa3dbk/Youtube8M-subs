00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
you use oatmeal mask and it's very good

for<00:02:33.239> dry<00:02:33.600> skin<00:02:33.720> it<00:02:34.080> must<00:02:34.319> rise<00:02:34.620> it<00:02:34.800> is<00:02:34.920> dry<00:02:35.160> skin

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:35.489 
for dry skin it must rise it is dry skin

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:38.930 
for dry skin it must rise it is dry skin
and<00:02:35.610> it<00:02:36.360> also<00:02:36.630> nourishes<00:02:37.230> the<00:02:37.830> normal<00:02:38.730> and

and it also nourishes the normal and
combination<00:02:39.750> skin<00:02:40.470> and<00:02:41.450> I<00:02:42.450> even<00:02:42.840> recommend

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
combination skin and I even recommend

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.190 
combination skin and I even recommend
this<00:02:43.680> for<00:02:43.920> oily<00:02:44.910> skin<00:02:44.940> because<00:02:45.569> it<00:02:45.930> reduces

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
this for oily skin because it reduces

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.270 
this for oily skin because it reduces
the<00:02:46.769> inertial<00:02:47.310> a<00:02:47.489> shiny<00:02:48.450> on<00:02:48.810> oily<00:02:49.470> shine<00:02:49.709> when

in the heat the oily skin gets so oily

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.720 
in the heat the oily skin gets so oily
and<00:02:54.000> looks<00:02:54.780> bad<00:02:55.049> because<00:02:55.650> I<00:02:55.920> have<00:02:56.250> the<00:02:56.370> oily
