of<00:04:59.300> my<00:04:59.389> weddings<00:04:59.780> now<00:05:00.050> the<00:05:00.110> bride<00:05:00.560> and<00:05:00.710> groom

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:00.860 
of my weddings now the bride and groom

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:02.529 
of my weddings now the bride and groom
are<00:05:01.069> seeing<00:05:01.340> each<00:05:01.460> other<00:05:01.610> ahead<00:05:01.969> of<00:05:02.060> time<00:05:02.270> and

are seeing each other ahead of time and

00:05:02.539 --> 00:05:04.779 
are seeing each other ahead of time and
they<00:05:03.229> think<00:05:03.289> that<00:05:03.620> it<00:05:03.710> won't<00:05:03.949> be<00:05:04.129> as<00:05:04.430> special

00:05:04.779 --> 00:05:04.789 
they think that it won't be as special

00:05:04.789 --> 00:05:08.020 
they think that it won't be as special
that<00:05:05.240> way<00:05:05.449> but<00:05:06.319> it<00:05:06.740> really<00:05:07.190> can<00:05:07.400> actually<00:05:07.879> be

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:08.030 
that way but it really can actually be

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:10.149 
that way but it really can actually be
more<00:05:08.270> special<00:05:08.719> because<00:05:08.840> they<00:05:09.409> have<00:05:09.590> a<00:05:09.620> private

00:05:10.149 --> 00:05:10.159 
more special because they have a private

00:05:10.159 --> 00:05:12.369 
more special because they have a private
moment<00:05:10.310> before<00:05:10.849> the<00:05:11.419> whole<00:05:11.599> rest<00:05:11.930> of<00:05:12.080> the<00:05:12.139> day
