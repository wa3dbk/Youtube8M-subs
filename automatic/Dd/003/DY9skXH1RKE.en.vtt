00:00:12.949 --> 00:00:14.199
 It is not the first 

00:00:14.199 --> 00:00:17.499
 I was naive to show you your new tutorial 

00:00:17.499 --> 00:00:22.239
 on that occasion to demonstrate how how to make an optical cinema effect that's 

00:00:22.239 --> 00:00:24.210
 sample 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.359
 baleares a very very simple effect and I hope 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.429
 I could help them ask me to be this tutorial 

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:32.890
 I saw good we started 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:34.620
 in the image 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.690

 he came with his own pictures 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:49.050

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.300
 kapranos right click duplicate sapa 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.300
 OK 

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:59.060

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:02.070
 this is the message sent to you 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.350
 curves 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.330
 we would 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.320
 lower the blacks 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:09.730
 Not that much 

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:12.920
 when going up the light murillo alonso that 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.400
 we are not going to talk about sex with men 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:18.870
 the Mexican team for the little ones 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:20.170
 like nothing 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:21.410
 to 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:23.170
 under this scheme 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:25.090
 balance of the colossus 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.090
 if the illuminations did not 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:31.210
 gonzÃ¡lez not going up the blues 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:33.830
 and in the others we will not lower it 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:36.200
 with the successful completion 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.460
 a lesbian 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.460
 in amazement he managed to put more useful 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.890
 we dined or what we duplicated again the sheet with right slim 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.870
 duplicate capable 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:50.400
 we give it again or that it 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.730
 god and to the country well the throne 

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:55.730
 interpret lighting effects 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:58.140
 here we are going to put a 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.420
 it's a type of the six so many sitting here 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.710
 and if they do not access michael from the ray of common interest the light 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.849
 who reproached him that nothing more illusion in peace where they demand a 

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:13.609
 explanation to citizens about this fact 

00:02:13.609 --> 00:02:16.489
 if you see that light went on in this part 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:19.549
 how we duplicate the layer only heard opacity 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:22.429
 we notify 

00:02:22.429 --> 00:02:25.429
 we combine with 

00:02:26.759 --> 00:02:30.579
 and well again we hear right click explain cappa we give you complaints 

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:33.879
 everything will go to us 

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:35.059
 cc oo 

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:36.389
 unfocused 

00:02:36.389 --> 00:02:39.389
 I do not know why they did it 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:43.989
 we focus a lot without losing the details 

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:47.569
 in a special shock to create a 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:51.139
 kennedy as it is as if it were a professional camera approach 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:57.169
 Obviously if there is your autograph bush you can not create from your camera 

00:02:57.169 --> 00:03:00.219
 T-shirt just missing a bit of his portentous 

00:03:00.219 --> 00:03:01.389
 we are not going to create 

00:03:01.389 --> 00:03:05.769
 well once we wanted him to blur we're going to apply the layer mask with 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:08.679
 that purpose is not our case 

00:03:08.679 --> 00:03:10.140
 we select a brush 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.149
 black color 

00:03:12.149 --> 00:03:13.899
 click here 

00:03:13.899 --> 00:03:17.889
 we select right click here said this is black fifth 

00:03:17.889 --> 00:03:19.429
 the crash 

00:03:19.429 --> 00:03:22.599
 and we only click 

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:25.689
 that part that we want to focus on 

00:03:25.689 --> 00:03:28.689
 in this case the girl 

00:03:31.669 --> 00:03:33.619
 once you have done this 

00:03:33.619 --> 00:03:36.709
 we combine with control one hundred 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:40.539
 and if we see that in that who lacks that something we can 

00:03:40.539 --> 00:03:44.039
 with a little more of Disney's shadow 

00:03:44.039 --> 00:03:46.469
 with in burbank 

00:03:46.469 --> 00:03:49.469
 pressure found the plateau as a synonym for March 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:52.509
 order once this is done 

00:03:52.509 --> 00:03:55.859
 let's go to image 

00:03:55.859 --> 00:03:57.929
 canvas size 

00:03:57.929 --> 00:04:02.219
 and in this case it has 18 points eight centimeters to which I spoke 

00:04:02.219 --> 00:04:04.359
 increased only to height 

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:06.179
 to 23 centimeters 

00:04:06.179 --> 00:04:08.199
 I know that at these lines 

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:11.759
 and with this we conclude and the effect is 

00:04:12.869 --> 00:04:15.869
 the closest to the film I hope you liked it 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:20.599
 if they or river await us the next tutorial 

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:23.840

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:24.410
