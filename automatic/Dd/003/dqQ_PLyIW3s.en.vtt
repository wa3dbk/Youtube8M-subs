00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:06.689
 two 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:20.180
 and here you have the rabbit with the ears 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:22.160
 the world's largest is Dumbo and its 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:26.119
 woman is zumba we just measured from 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:29.290
 Germany win the contest to the rabbit 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:32.660
 english love with the biggest ears 

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:35.000
 then the male dunboa won the first 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:38.690
 award and the female Zumba has won the 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.480
 second prize in the category of ears 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:43.430
 in english love and the first question that 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:46.100
 you usually do, it will be that these 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:48.050
 rabbits with ears so long they hear 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:51.380
 better than other rabbits with ears 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:53.690
 shorter because they do not hear as well 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:56.780
 rabbits have a sense of hearing 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:01:01.820
 quite developed and these ears 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:04.759
 they really are a complication 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:06.920
 added in terms of care leave 

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:09.799
 quiet because we are going to focus on 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.930
 taking care of the ears of these 

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:15.710
 rabbits that have them so big that 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:16.070
 it's the English you see how much of 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:18.830
 foot 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:20.630
 what we have here to take care of what 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:22.880
 occurs these rabbits that have the 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:25.310
 ears so long and so fallen they go 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:27.620
 dragging all the time so there's 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:30.260
 that put soils substrates that are 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:34.280
 special and that do you no harm 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:36.200
 to your skin and inside your ears 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:39.350
 we have to apply some cream 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:41.300
 moisturizer is also ideal for 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:44.380
 clean them internally is to use 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:47.180
 specific head cleaners 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:49.610
 we the one we always use is the 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:51.390
 of our brand cunÃ­ pib 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:54.710
 Y 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.710
 he's got an applicator 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:06.210
 We can clean the entire surface 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.830
 because it is also moisturizing and not 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:11.780
 let's have no fear of falling 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:11.780
 in once applied 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:18.819
 the cleaner simply with a cotton 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:21.760
 let's clean the entire surface of the 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:24.849
 skin and you are going to see that also as they go 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:27.430
 dragging the cotton out to the 

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:30.370
 final a little dirty 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:32.780
 it is important that we also do it in 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.580
 the inside of the ear 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.920
 is that the guinea bug bothers him a little 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:40.270
 it's completely normal to nobody 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.270
 like to be urged inside the ears 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:46.020
 we repeat in the other ear remember by 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:48.600
 the entire surface of the ear of the 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:51.020
 ear forgiveness and also that fall inside 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.020
 of the ear 

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:59.150
 for the rabbit it 's a bit unpleasant 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:00.830
 but we must do it with care and 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:03.350
 sure that with the passage of time 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:06.140
 is going to get used as you see then 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:08.840
 at the end they are still and they are well 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:11.180
 used to us doing it 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:14.930
 and the choice of the substrate is 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:17.629
 fundamentally fix this is sawdust it 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:21.379
 commonly sold as soil substrate 

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:23.330
 universal to keep pets in this 

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:25.519
 kind of rabbits in all but that in 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:28.730
 this kind of rabbits we should never 

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:30.830
 use substrates that are so finite 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:32.180
 of these particles so small and that 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:34.940
 they can get inside the ear and 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:37.400
 generate an infection so we 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:39.319
 we forget that the substrate we will choose 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:41.000
 let's choose a paper substrate of 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:43.310
 newspaper here you have it 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.950
 you have heard me speak a thousand times about 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:48.440
 substrate nature leader of culp and is 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:50.030
 made of newspaper and 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:52.010
 although obviously you can get 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:53.660
 inside the ear like sawdust but at 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:55.819
 be the newspaper is soft 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:58.160
 never going to nail is not going to splinter 

00:03:55.819 --> 00:04:00.379
 it does not make dust and it will not catch 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:03.590
 Ear infections never so much 

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:06.500
 remember ear cleaning for all 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:08.750
 the rabbits once a week 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:12.230
 Cleaning the whole rabbit once a 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:15.790
 month the substrate made from paper of 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:19.570
 newspaper and already the only thing I have left 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:22.509
 show you what these rabbits are like 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:26.889
 you are so long when they are 

00:04:22.509 --> 00:04:31.670
 small here you have a baby from english 

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:34.640
 love when you have 2 months to live 

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:37.400
 note that proportionally still the 

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:40.220
 ears have not grown so much but 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:44.150
 Now you are going to see one with six months of 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:46.820
 life you see that the ears are already beginning 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:49.750
 to grow a lot the English what 

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:54.140
 They are pretty big sized rabbits 

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:58.310
 they even reach up to five or six 

00:04:54.140 --> 00:05:01.010
 kilos of weight and his ears are 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:03.230
 develop they start to get bigger between 

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:05.630
 five months and seven months 

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:08.150
 reaching the maximum when the rabbits 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:10.460
 they finish their growth that is around 

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:14.560
 of the year even up to a year and a half 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:14.560
 life because they are pretty big rabbits
