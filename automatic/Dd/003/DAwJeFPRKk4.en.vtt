00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.150
 high heels standards i want you one 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:09.929
 short safe easy solution for 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:12.000
 diabetes type 2 present in diabetes 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.740
 Type 2 is not really right 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.320
 illness but just one 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:19.400
 The lifestyle that he just arises 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:22.230
 too much fat and too much sugar 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:24.840
 because above all things are therefore the first 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.090
 main reason too much fat than that many 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:31.579
 fat then blocks the sugar intake 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:36.210
 The cell has something fat in it 

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:37.980
 mainly animal products like sausage 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:42.980
 So everything there is to meat 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:45.960
 buy but also milk and milk eggs 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:48.510
 dairy products such as cheese yogurt and such 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.670
 further contain too much fat or 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:54.660
 the most finished products too 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:59.219
 a lot of fat also contains a lot of fat 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:01.109
 which is 100 percent fit and if the type 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.260
 We should also have 2 diabetes 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:06.659
 not just with healthy fats like 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:08.640
 Olive avocados and nuts over food 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.090
 because they also contain a lot 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:15.240
 But fat is the main cause 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:17.640
 animal products for type 2 diabetes if we 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.600
 we do without animal products 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.560
 already a very good chance 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.060
 get rid of type 2 diabetes 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.920
 It is even better if we not only 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:29.250
 to abstain from fat but also to 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:33.329
 sugar then we are diabetes on everyone 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:36.869
 case go so type 2 diabetes type 1 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:39.990
 diabetes is not always curable because 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:43.890
 the pancreas may already 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:46.470
 irreparably damaged but is type 2 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.899
 diabetes is always 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.369
 curable in a relatively short time if we 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:54.210
 to abstain from fat mainly 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:56.399
 animal products and on sugar where is now 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.439
 Now sugar everywhere hides the knowledge 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:01.130
 many not so not only in 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:04.740
 finished sweets 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:07.950
 Household sugar but also in 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:10.739
 heated starch heated rice heated 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:12.959
 Potatoes heated dough and baked goods 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.980
 So everything you can buy at the bakery 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:16.570
 gives 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:21.190
 is also sugar last or last 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:25.780
 Alcohol is pure sugar too 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:27.610
 all sweeteners supposedly healthier 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:31.480
 should contain only pure 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:35.560
 sugar the agave syrup cocos flowers 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:40.150
 sugar silit birch sugar or the 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:44.250
 latest trend of thick juice is only too 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:48.000
 pure sugar and just around there 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:51.900
 people who are addicted to sugar and 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:54.690
 to eat something supposedly healthier 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:57.489
 to pull the money out of the bag 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:59.290
 I can not think of another meaning 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:01.660
 just imagine that just pure 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:05.320
 Sugar is only much more expensive than 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:08.260
 refined sugar too much sugar 

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:10.390
 we can absorb too many sweet ones 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:13.810
 fruits it's all about it 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:17.110
 that our fruits in the supermarket 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:21.190
 sugar was bred for example 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:23.980
 a banana was originally important 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:25.750
 small contained large cores and 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.380
 Did not taste very sweet but 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:31.420
 was much more intense in taste so 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:34.420
 contained much more nutrients and 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:36.780
 not just sugar or worse 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:39.730
 are dry fruits like dates 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:43.630
 contain more than two thirds pure 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:47.010
 sugar it is just as harmful as that 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:49.440
 just mentioned sugar units 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:52.360
 So we are definitely 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:55.209
 type 2 diabetes goes on when we go on fat and 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:04:00.060
 Sugar mainly give up 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:04:00.060
 animal products or other finished products
