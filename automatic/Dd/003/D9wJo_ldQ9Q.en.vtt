00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.290 
explode okay so if you've got a kid are
you<00:00:40.950> teaching<00:00:41.219> on<00:00:41.430> a<00:00:41.520> triple<00:00:41.730> threat<00:00:42.090> where

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
you teaching on a triple threat where

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.900 
you teaching on a triple threat where
you<00:00:42.360> here<00:00:42.800> and<00:00:43.800> you<00:00:43.890> drive<00:00:44.250> off<00:00:44.489> that<00:00:44.520> back

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
you here and you drive off that back

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.670 
you here and you drive off that back
foot<00:00:44.940> if<00:00:45.840> they're<00:00:46.020> standing<00:00:46.379> straight<00:00:46.649> up

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
foot if they're standing straight up

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.740 
foot if they're standing straight up
again<00:00:47.250> it's<00:00:47.760> hard<00:00:47.969> to<00:00:48.090> explode<00:00:48.420> into<00:00:48.570> that

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
again it's hard to explode into that

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.619 
again it's hard to explode into that
corner<00:00:49.110> to<00:00:49.200> shoot<00:00:49.469> so<00:00:50.219> what<00:00:50.430> we<00:00:50.550> do<00:00:50.789> take<00:00:51.539> the

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
corner to shoot so what we do take the

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.350 
corner to shoot so what we do take the

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
ball here keep it away and we take that

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.619 
ball here keep it away and we take that
first<00:00:54.750> step<00:00:55.340> you<00:00:56.340> got<00:00:56.969> to<00:00:57.059> take<00:00:57.180> that<00:00:57.360> first

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
first step you got to take that first

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.260 
first step you got to take that first
step<00:00:57.780> very<00:00:58.350> important<00:00:58.949> to<00:00:59.460> take<00:00:59.640> a<00:00:59.670> basketball

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
step very important to take a basketball

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.930 
step very important to take a basketball
step<00:01:00.629> and<00:01:00.870> explode<00:01:01.260> you<00:01:01.890> need<00:01:02.100> to<00:01:02.280> get<00:01:02.489> past

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
step and explode you need to get past

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.009 
step and explode you need to get past
that<00:01:03.180> defense

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:05.019 
that defense

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:07.950 
that defense
Millis<00:01:05.829> itches<00:01:06.729> like<00:01:07.000> some<00:01:07.570> of<00:01:07.659> the<00:01:07.719> shots

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:07.960 
Millis itches like some of the shots

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:09.660 
Millis itches like some of the shots
that<00:01:08.109> we<00:01:08.200> get<00:01:08.469> off<00:01:08.590> the<00:01:08.740> only<00:01:08.859> play<00:01:09.039> basketball

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:09.670

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:30.010 
step we square up fall up release

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:34.530 
step we square up fall up release
release<00:01:30.729> point<00:01:31.060> okay<00:01:31.890> we<00:01:32.890> need<00:01:33.210> for<00:01:34.210> the<00:01:34.270> same

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:34.540 
release point okay we need for the same

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:37.080 
release point okay we need for the same
thing<00:01:35.290> the<00:01:35.410> whole<00:01:35.560> trip<00:01:35.860> for<00:01:36.040> our<00:01:36.250> defensive

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:37.090 
thing the whole trip for our defensive

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:39.180 
thing the whole trip for our defensive
players<00:01:37.360> defensive<00:01:38.350> players<00:01:38.560> need<00:01:38.830> to<00:01:38.860> do<00:01:39.040> the

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:42.100 
same thing so they're taking a first

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.430 
same thing so they're taking a first
step<00:01:42.310> on<00:01:42.580> you<00:01:43.270> need<00:01:43.479> to<00:01:43.510> take<00:01:43.720> your<00:01:43.900> first<00:01:44.200> step
