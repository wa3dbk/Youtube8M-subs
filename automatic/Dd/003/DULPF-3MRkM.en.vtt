groups<00:00:04.350> as<00:00:04.560> well<00:00:04.799> as<00:00:04.890> my<00:00:04.980> predictions<00:00:05.400> as<00:00:05.549> to

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:05.790 
groups as well as my predictions as to

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:06.800 
groups as well as my predictions as to
who's<00:00:05.970> going<00:00:06.000> to<00:00:06.210> make<00:00:06.270> it<00:00:06.420> out<00:00:06.509> of<00:00:06.540> the<00:00:06.629> group

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:06.810 
who's going to make it out of the group

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:08.900 
who's going to make it out of the group
stage<00:00:06.839> so<00:00:07.290> I<00:00:07.500> just<00:00:07.919> consider<00:00:08.280> eight<00:00:08.639> groups

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
stage so I just consider eight groups

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.720 
stage so I just consider eight groups
here<00:00:09.210> ABCD<00:00:09.719> efg<00:00:09.769> H<00:00:10.769> and<00:00:11.099> in<00:00:11.280> the<00:00:11.340> first<00:00:11.550> group

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
here ABCD efg H and in the first group

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.669 
here ABCD efg H and in the first group
guys<00:00:11.940> group<00:00:12.389> a<00:00:12.540> we<00:00:12.719> have<00:00:12.809> Brazil<00:00:13.139> Croatia<00:00:13.320> in

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
guys group a we have Brazil Croatia in

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.760 
guys group a we have Brazil Croatia in
Mexico<00:00:14.070> and<00:00:14.219> Cameroon<00:00:14.639> so<00:00:15.230> pretty<00:00:16.230> balanced

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
Mexico and Cameroon so pretty balanced

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.230 
Mexico and Cameroon so pretty balanced
group<00:00:16.920> compared<00:00:17.400> to<00:00:17.490> the<00:00:17.580> rest<00:00:17.760> of<00:00:17.940> them

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
group compared to the rest of them

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.120 
group compared to the rest of them
Brazil<00:00:18.810> obviously<00:00:19.260> is<00:00:19.410> the<00:00:19.560> host<00:00:19.770> of<00:00:19.949> this

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
Brazil obviously is the host of this

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.160 
Brazil obviously is the host of this
FIFA<00:00:20.699> World<00:00:20.760> Cup<00:00:21.060> so<00:00:21.330> they're<00:00:21.689> expected<00:00:22.050> to<00:00:22.080> do

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
FIFA World Cup so they're expected to do

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.439 
FIFA World Cup so they're expected to do
quite<00:00:22.439> well<00:00:22.609> Croatia<00:00:23.609> is<00:00:23.789> a<00:00:23.850> pretty<00:00:24.060> decent

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
quite well Croatia is a pretty decent

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.540 
quite well Croatia is a pretty decent
team<00:00:24.630> let<00:00:25.170> me<00:00:25.260> a<00:00:25.289> Mexico<00:00:25.800> and<00:00:25.920> Cameroon<00:00:26.310> who

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
team let me a Mexico and Cameroon who

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.250 
team let me a Mexico and Cameroon who
are<00:00:27.000> probably<00:00:27.269> the<00:00:27.390> two<00:00:27.510> bomb<00:00:27.689> teams<00:00:27.990> in<00:00:28.140> this

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
are probably the two bomb teams in this

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:29.689 
are probably the two bomb teams in this
group<00:00:28.500> but<00:00:28.650> it<00:00:28.740> can<00:00:28.830> definitely<00:00:28.949> compete<00:00:29.519> at

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
group but it can definitely compete at

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.460 
group but it can definitely compete at
least<00:00:29.880> with<00:00:30.000> Croatia<00:00:30.269> for<00:00:30.539> that<00:00:30.689> second<00:00:30.990> spot

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
least with Croatia for that second spot

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.680 
least with Croatia for that second spot
I'd<00:00:32.070> be<00:00:32.369> guys<00:00:32.640> in<00:00:32.880> Group<00:00:33.030> B<00:00:33.059> sorry<00:00:33.480> we<00:00:33.600> have

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
I'd be guys in Group B sorry we have

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.080 
I'd be guys in Group B sorry we have
Spain<00:00:33.989> Netherlands<00:00:34.500> Chile<00:00:34.590> and<00:00:35.160> Australia<00:00:35.610> I

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
Spain Netherlands Chile and Australia I

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.690 
Spain Netherlands Chile and Australia I
think<00:00:36.180> you<00:00:36.540> know<00:00:36.660> Spain<00:00:37.050> being<00:00:37.380> the<00:00:37.700> returning

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
think you know Spain being the returning

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.220 
think you know Spain being the returning
champion<00:00:38.850> Netherlands<00:00:39.690> being<00:00:39.870> the<00:00:39.960> returning

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
champion Netherlands being the returning

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.750 
champion Netherlands being the returning
runner-up<00:00:40.739> that's<00:00:40.950> a<00:00:41.040> lot<00:00:41.160> of<00:00:41.280> power<00:00:41.520> in<00:00:41.700> that

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
runner-up that's a lot of power in that

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.119 
runner-up that's a lot of power in that
group<00:00:42.090> also<00:00:42.450> Chile<00:00:43.050> and<00:00:43.320> Australia<00:00:43.620> are<00:00:43.980> both

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
group also Chile and Australia are both

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.130 
group also Chile and Australia are both
decent<00:00:44.640> teams<00:00:44.879> especially<00:00:45.570> just<00:00:45.870> for<00:00:45.989> like

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
decent teams especially just for like

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.660 
decent teams especially just for like
the<00:00:46.230> third<00:00:46.260> and<00:00:46.590> fourth<00:00:46.800> teams<00:00:47.070> in<00:00:47.280> that<00:00:47.430> group

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
the third and fourth teams in that group

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.630 
the third and fourth teams in that group
on<00:00:48.000> Group<00:00:48.450> C<00:00:48.690> we<00:00:48.809> have<00:00:48.930> Colombia<00:00:49.410> Greece<00:00:49.770> Ivory

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
on Group C we have Colombia Greece Ivory

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.180 
on Group C we have Colombia Greece Ivory
Coast<00:00:50.910> and<00:00:51.210> Japan<00:00:51.629> so<00:00:51.960> this<00:00:52.710> is<00:00:52.829> kind<00:00:53.039> of<00:00:53.070> a

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
Coast and Japan so this is kind of a

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.160 
Coast and Japan so this is kind of a
weak<00:00:53.370> group<00:00:53.670> Colombia<00:00:54.480> is<00:00:54.539> probably<00:00:54.840> the<00:00:54.960> best

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
weak group Colombia is probably the best

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.139 
weak group Colombia is probably the best
team<00:00:55.350> in<00:00:55.500> that<00:00:55.559> group<00:00:55.829> and<00:00:56.039> you<00:00:56.820> know<00:00:56.910> they're

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
team in that group and you know they're

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:58.700 
team in that group and you know they're
not<00:00:57.270> even<00:00:57.329> one<00:00:57.809> of<00:00:57.930> the<00:00:57.989> best<00:00:58.170> teams<00:00:58.440> in<00:00:58.559> this

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
not even one of the best teams in this

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.560 
not even one of the best teams in this
tournament<00:00:59.070> so<00:00:59.370> I<00:00:59.550> shows<00:01:00.030> you<00:01:00.149> how<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:00.270> groups

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
tournament so I shows you how the groups

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.389 
tournament so I shows you how the groups
are<00:01:00.750> really<00:01:00.840> not<00:01:01.050> that<00:01:01.230> balanced<00:01:01.680> a<00:01:01.829> group<00:01:02.250> to

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
are really not that balanced a group to

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.189 
are really not that balanced a group to
you<00:01:02.520> guys<00:01:02.640> we<00:01:02.850> have<00:01:02.940> Uruguay<00:01:03.420> Costa<00:01:03.690> Rica

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
you guys we have Uruguay Costa Rica

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.590 
you guys we have Uruguay Costa Rica
England<00:01:04.949> and<00:01:05.040> Italy<00:01:05.189> so<00:01:05.610> aside<00:01:05.970> from<00:01:06.030> Costa

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
England and Italy so aside from Costa

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.750 
England and Italy so aside from Costa
Rica<00:01:06.840> we<00:01:06.960> have<00:01:07.049> three<00:01:07.380> solid<00:01:08.159> teams<00:01:08.549> who<00:01:08.700> are

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
Rica we have three solid teams who are

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.070 
Rica we have three solid teams who are
all<00:01:08.850> been<00:01:09.060> competing<00:01:09.330> for<00:01:09.570> those<00:01:09.630> top<00:01:09.869> two

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
all been competing for those top two

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.020 
all been competing for those top two
spots<00:01:10.229> I<00:01:10.710> Group<00:01:11.340> II<00:01:11.520> guys<00:01:11.700> we<00:01:11.939> have

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
spots I Group II guys we have

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.390 
spots I Group II guys we have
Switzerland<00:01:12.570> Ecuador<00:01:12.659> France<00:01:13.650> and<00:01:13.920> Honduras

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
Switzerland Ecuador France and Honduras

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.060 
Switzerland Ecuador France and Honduras
so<00:01:14.670> another<00:01:15.479> very<00:01:15.540> weak<00:01:16.500> group<00:01:16.860> I<00:01:17.009> think

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
so another very weak group I think

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.010 
so another very weak group I think
France<00:01:17.549> is<00:01:17.790> pretty<00:01:18.270> lucky<00:01:18.540> to<00:01:18.689> be<00:01:18.810> in<00:01:18.900> that

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
France is pretty lucky to be in that

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.590 
France is pretty lucky to be in that
group<00:01:19.159> Group<00:01:20.159> F<00:01:20.369> guys<00:01:20.610> we<00:01:20.759> have<00:01:20.850> Argentinian

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
group Group F guys we have Argentinian

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.109 
group Group F guys we have Argentinian
Bosnia<00:01:22.110> Iran<00:01:22.890> in<00:01:23.009> Nigeria<00:01:23.549> so<00:01:23.850> this<00:01:24.000> is

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
Bosnia Iran in Nigeria so this is

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:25.370 
Bosnia Iran in Nigeria so this is
another<00:01:24.330> weak<00:01:24.570> group<00:01:24.810> in<00:01:24.930> my<00:01:25.020> opinion

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
another weak group in my opinion

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.560 
another weak group in my opinion
obviously<00:01:25.680> Argentina<00:01:26.490> is<00:01:26.640> the<00:01:26.700> definite

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
obviously Argentina is the definite

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.240 
obviously Argentina is the definite
favored<00:01:27.780> in<00:01:27.930> that<00:01:28.080> group<00:01:28.320> and<00:01:28.530> probably

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
favored in that group and probably

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.700 
favored in that group and probably
Bosnia<00:01:29.850> as<00:01:29.939> the<00:01:30.060> runner-up<00:01:30.329> in<00:01:30.659> Group<00:01:31.140> G<00:01:31.350> guys

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
Bosnia as the runner-up in Group G guys

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.980 
Bosnia as the runner-up in Group G guys
we<00:01:31.920> have<00:01:32.040> Germany<00:01:32.490> Portugal<00:01:32.670> gone<00:01:33.299> in<00:01:33.479> USA<00:01:33.930> so

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
we have Germany Portugal gone in USA so

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.980 
we have Germany Portugal gone in USA so
that<00:01:34.770> group<00:01:35.070> is<00:01:35.310> probably<00:01:36.090> the<00:01:36.540> toughest

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
that group is probably the toughest

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.499 
that group is probably the toughest
group<00:01:37.200> in<00:01:37.409> the<00:01:37.829> FIFA<00:01:38.040> World<00:01:38.130> Cup<00:01:38.430> just<00:01:39.090> kind<00:01:39.420> of

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
group in the FIFA World Cup just kind of

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.899 
group in the FIFA World Cup just kind of
insane<00:01:39.930> how<00:01:40.170> they<00:01:40.740> have<00:01:40.860> four<00:01:41.579> really<00:01:41.729> good

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
insane how they have four really good

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.370 
insane how they have four really good
teams<00:01:42.180> there<00:01:42.390> I<00:01:42.420> believe<00:01:42.720> all<00:01:42.930> four<00:01:43.200> of<00:01:43.229> those

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
teams there I believe all four of those

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.560 
teams there I believe all four of those
teams<00:01:43.680> made<00:01:43.950> it<00:01:43.979> past<00:01:44.909> the<00:01:45.119> group<00:01:45.240> stage<00:01:45.540> in

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
teams made it past the group stage in

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.090 
teams made it past the group stage in
the<00:01:45.780> 2010<00:01:46.200> World<00:01:46.229> Cup<00:01:46.560> and<00:01:46.740> now<00:01:46.829> they're<00:01:46.979> all

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
the 2010 World Cup and now they're all

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.920 
the 2010 World Cup and now they're all
in<00:01:47.280> the<00:01:47.820> same<00:01:47.850> group<00:01:48.240> so<00:01:48.479> it's<00:01:48.570> gonna<00:01:48.659> be<00:01:48.780> quite

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
in the same group so it's gonna be quite

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.569 
in the same group so it's gonna be quite
interesting<00:01:49.320> obviously<00:01:49.500> Germany<00:01:50.399> and

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
interesting obviously Germany and

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.639 
interesting obviously Germany and
Portugal<00:01:50.729> probably<00:01:51.390> the<00:01:51.810> two<00:01:52.020> favourites<00:01:52.500> but

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
Portugal probably the two favourites but

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.380 
Portugal probably the two favourites but
gone<00:01:52.799> and<00:01:52.950> USA<00:01:53.250> are<00:01:53.280> both<00:01:53.579> quite<00:01:53.909> competitive

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
gone and USA are both quite competitive

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:55.580 
gone and USA are both quite competitive
teams<00:01:54.630> and<00:01:54.810> they<00:01:54.869> could<00:01:55.020> possibly<00:01:55.320> a

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
teams and they could possibly a

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.560 
teams and they could possibly a
dark-horse<00:01:56.009> and<00:01:56.310> slide<00:01:56.880> into<00:01:57.119> the<00:01:57.240> second

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
dark-horse and slide into the second

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.539 
dark-horse and slide into the second
spot<00:01:57.719> and<00:01:57.960> finally<00:01:58.619> guys<00:01:58.740> in<00:01:58.950> Group<00:01:59.100> H<00:01:59.250> we<00:01:59.490> have

those teams so that should be a

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.110 
those teams so that should be a
interesting<00:02:13.950> group<00:02:14.130> and<00:02:14.340> Irene<00:02:14.850> here<00:02:14.940> guys

want<00:02:15.330> to<00:02:15.390> give<00:02:15.480> you<00:02:15.540> my<00:02:15.630> predictions<00:02:16.260> on<00:02:16.440> which

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
want to give you my predictions on which

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.230 
want to give you my predictions on which
two<00:02:17.100> teams<00:02:17.280> from<00:02:17.490> each<00:02:17.580> group<00:02:17.670> I<00:02:17.940> think<00:02:18.000> you're

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
two teams from each group I think you're

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.270 
two teams from each group I think you're
hearing<00:02:18.390> to<00:02:18.630> advance<00:02:18.900> so<00:02:19.170> I<00:02:19.410> just<00:02:19.890> can<00:02:20.040> see<00:02:20.190> in

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
hearing to advance so I just can see in

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.610 
hearing to advance so I just can see in
group<00:02:20.459> a<00:02:20.580> I<00:02:20.640> picked<00:02:21.000> Brazil<00:02:21.360> and<00:02:21.480> Croatia

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
group a I picked Brazil and Croatia

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.780 
group a I picked Brazil and Croatia
Brazil<00:02:22.620> is<00:02:22.680> by<00:02:22.890> far<00:02:23.160> the<00:02:23.190> best<00:02:23.370> team<00:02:23.610> in<00:02:23.640> that

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
Brazil is by far the best team in that

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.580 
Brazil is by far the best team in that
group<00:02:24.000> as<00:02:24.150> well<00:02:24.300> being<00:02:24.480> the<00:02:24.600> host<00:02:24.810> nation<00:02:25.500> I

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
group as well being the host nation I

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:26.780 
group as well being the host nation I
think<00:02:25.620> you<00:02:25.860> know<00:02:25.950> there's<00:02:26.130> gonna<00:02:26.220> have<00:02:26.310> added

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
think you know there's gonna have added

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.790 
think you know there's gonna have added
pressure<00:02:27.600> as<00:02:27.840> well<00:02:27.959> as<00:02:28.020> added<00:02:28.290> motivation<00:02:28.410> to

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
pressure as well as added motivation to

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.410 
pressure as well as added motivation to
make<00:02:28.920> it<00:02:29.130> co<00:02:29.550> Asia<00:02:29.819> thinks<00:02:30.120> probably<00:02:30.360> the

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
make it co Asia thinks probably the

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.540 
make it co Asia thinks probably the
second<00:02:30.690> best<00:02:30.840> team<00:02:31.500> in<00:02:31.650> that<00:02:31.770> group<00:02:31.980> and<00:02:32.190> I

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
second best team in that group and I

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:33.949 
second best team in that group and I
think<00:02:32.730> they'll<00:02:32.850> definitely<00:02:33.209> take<00:02:33.330> that<00:02:33.360> spot

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
think they'll definitely take that spot

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:36.380 
think they'll definitely take that spot
Group<00:02:34.350> B<00:02:34.590> you<00:02:35.520> know<00:02:35.610> Spain<00:02:36.000> being<00:02:36.270> the

probably<00:02:53.519> the<00:02:53.700> only<00:02:53.910> African<00:02:54.269> team<00:02:54.450> I<00:02:54.540> think<00:02:54.600> I

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
probably the only African team I think I

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:55.910 
probably the only African team I think I
picked<00:02:54.989> to<00:02:55.080> make<00:02:55.230> it<00:02:55.410> but<00:02:55.530> I<00:02:55.590> think<00:02:55.739> they're

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
picked to make it but I think they're

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.560 
picked to make it but I think they're
one<00:02:56.430> of<00:02:56.459> the<00:02:56.580> better<00:02:56.700> ones<00:02:57.030> and<00:02:57.150> I<00:02:57.239> think<00:02:57.420> that

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.570 
one of the better ones and I think that

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:58.699 
one of the better ones and I think that
they<00:02:57.690> have<00:02:57.780> a<00:02:57.840> really<00:02:58.050> good<00:02:58.170> shot<00:02:58.440> in<00:02:58.590> this

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
they have a really good shot in this

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:01.729 
they have a really good shot in this
group<00:02:59.150> group<00:03:00.150> key<00:03:00.300> guys<00:03:00.510> probably<00:03:01.500> lot<00:03:01.680> of

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739 
group group key guys probably lot of

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:02.660 
group group key guys probably lot of
people<00:03:01.890> are<00:03:01.950> gonna<00:03:02.069> agree<00:03:02.220> with<00:03:02.370> this<00:03:02.489> I<00:03:02.610> have

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
people are gonna agree with this I have

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.479 
people are gonna agree with this I have
England<00:03:03.090> Italy<00:03:03.300> obviously

00:03:04.479 --> 00:03:04.489 
England Italy obviously

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:06.770 
England Italy obviously
Uruguay<00:03:05.489> is<00:03:05.550> gonna<00:03:05.760> not<00:03:05.970> be<00:03:06.150> making<00:03:06.330> it<00:03:06.630> I

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
Uruguay is gonna not be making it I

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.120 
Uruguay is gonna not be making it I
think<00:03:07.170> Italy's<00:03:07.530> probably<00:03:07.800> gonna<00:03:07.890> finish

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
think Italy's probably gonna finish

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:10.130 
think Italy's probably gonna finish
first<00:03:08.459> England<00:03:08.850> finished<00:03:09.120> second<00:03:09.569> all<00:03:09.989> the

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
first England finished second all the

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:11.390 
first England finished second all the
only<00:03:10.230> reason<00:03:10.470> I<00:03:10.530> have<00:03:10.680> England<00:03:11.069> finishing

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
only reason I have England finishing

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.759 
only reason I have England finishing
ahead<00:03:11.489> of<00:03:11.610> Uruguay<00:03:12.110> basically<00:03:13.110> I<00:03:13.170> think<00:03:13.260> yurga

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:13.769 
ahead of Uruguay basically I think yurga

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:15.259 
ahead of Uruguay basically I think yurga
ways<00:03:13.860> defense<00:03:14.280> isn't<00:03:14.459> strong<00:03:14.819> enough<00:03:14.850> and<00:03:15.180> I

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:15.269 
ways defense isn't strong enough and I

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:16.490 
ways defense isn't strong enough and I
think<00:03:15.450> Ealing<00:03:15.750> it's<00:03:15.900> a<00:03:16.019> better<00:03:16.200> all-around

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
think Ealing it's a better all-around

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.160 
think Ealing it's a better all-around
team<00:03:16.950> also<00:03:17.820> a<00:03:17.850> little<00:03:18.030> bit<00:03:18.090> biased<00:03:18.480> there<00:03:18.630> I'm

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
team also a little bit biased there I'm

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:20.840 
team also a little bit biased there I'm
Canadian<00:03:19.500> so<00:03:19.739> I<00:03:19.890> never<00:03:19.950> really<00:03:20.400> get<00:03:20.549> to<00:03:20.579> cheer

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:20.850 
Canadian so I never really get to cheer

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:22.580 
Canadian so I never really get to cheer
on<00:03:20.940> Canada<00:03:21.269> in<00:03:21.329> the<00:03:21.390> World<00:03:21.540> Cup<00:03:21.600> but<00:03:21.989> I<00:03:22.170> always

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
on Canada in the World Cup but I always

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.770 
on Canada in the World Cup but I always
Sharon<00:03:22.920> England<00:03:23.190> as<00:03:23.310> you<00:03:23.489> know<00:03:23.579> I'm<00:03:23.670> a<00:03:23.910> lot<00:03:24.600> of

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
Sharon England as you know I'm a lot of

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:26.360 
Sharon England as you know I'm a lot of
my<00:03:24.870> family<00:03:25.049> comes<00:03:25.380> from<00:03:25.530> England<00:03:25.650> so<00:03:26.010> that's

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
my family comes from England so that's

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:28.430 
my family comes from England so that's
team<00:03:26.549> I<00:03:26.640> like<00:03:26.730> to<00:03:26.880> see<00:03:27.030> do<00:03:27.209> good<00:03:27.420> and<00:03:27.660> even<00:03:27.989> even

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
team I like to see do good and even even

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:29.539 
team I like to see do good and even even
aside<00:03:28.680> from<00:03:28.709> that<00:03:28.860> like<00:03:29.100> I<00:03:29.130> said<00:03:29.190> I<00:03:29.370> think

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:29.549 
aside from that like I said I think

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:31.310 
aside from that like I said I think
they're<00:03:29.670> more<00:03:29.820> balanced<00:03:30.180> team<00:03:30.420> but<00:03:30.660> that'll

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:31.320 
they're more balanced team but that'll

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.500 
they're more balanced team but that'll
be<00:03:31.380> very<00:03:31.410> closed<00:03:32.180> group<00:03:33.180> they're<00:03:33.360> I<00:03:33.390> think

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
be very closed group they're I think

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:34.610 
be very closed group they're I think
they're<00:03:33.840> probably<00:03:33.989> the<00:03:34.170> second<00:03:34.470> strongest

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
they're probably the second strongest

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:37.580 
they're probably the second strongest
groups<00:03:35.010> behind<00:03:35.640> group<00:03:36.000> G<00:03:36.180> Group<00:03:36.209> II<00:03:37.170> guys<00:03:37.380> we

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
groups behind group G Group II guys we

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:39.590 
groups behind group G Group II guys we
have<00:03:37.739> Switzerland<00:03:38.670> and<00:03:38.760> France<00:03:38.790> both<00:03:39.239> moving

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:39.600 
have Switzerland and France both moving

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.870 
have Switzerland and France both moving
on<00:03:39.720> I<00:03:39.750> think<00:03:40.110> I<00:03:40.290> said<00:03:40.769> France<00:03:41.280> is<00:03:41.400> definitely

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
on I think I said France is definitely

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.640 
on I think I said France is definitely
one<00:03:41.970> of<00:03:42.000> the<00:03:42.120> better<00:03:42.239> teams<00:03:42.420> in<00:03:42.600> this<00:03:42.780> you<00:03:43.530> know

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
one of the better teams in this you know

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:45.590 
one of the better teams in this you know
tournament<00:03:44.220> they're<00:03:44.549> not<00:03:44.820> very<00:03:45.060> very<00:03:45.359> good<00:03:45.510> at

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:45.600 
tournament they're not very very good at

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.630 
tournament they're not very very good at
gnashed<00:03:45.810> international<00:03:46.620> play<00:03:46.799> but<00:03:47.040> I<00:03:47.250> have<00:03:47.609> a

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:47.640 
gnashed international play but I have a

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:48.710 
gnashed international play but I have a
pretty<00:03:47.790> weak<00:03:48.000> group<00:03:48.209> here<00:03:48.390> and<00:03:48.510> I<00:03:48.540> think

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
pretty weak group here and I think

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.030 
pretty weak group here and I think
Switzerland<00:03:49.140> is<00:03:49.200> a<00:03:49.230> pretty<00:03:49.410> young<00:03:49.590> team<00:03:49.859> and<00:03:49.890> I

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
Switzerland is a pretty young team and I

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:50.960 
Switzerland is a pretty young team and I
think<00:03:50.190> they<00:03:50.280> have<00:03:50.370> the<00:03:50.519> potential<00:03:50.790> to

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
think they have the potential to

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:52.759 
think they have the potential to
definitely<00:03:51.480> make<00:03:51.989> it<00:03:52.019> to<00:03:52.230> that<00:03:52.350> second<00:03:52.680> spot

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:52.769 
definitely make it to that second spot

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:53.810 
definitely make it to that second spot
and<00:03:53.040> who<00:03:53.130> knows<00:03:53.280> what<00:03:53.400> they<00:03:53.489> could<00:03:53.549> do<00:03:53.730> from

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:53.820 
and who knows what they could do from

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:54.229 
and who knows what they could do from
there

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 
there

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:56.240 
there
Ecuador<00:03:54.989> Honduras<00:03:55.440> are<00:03:55.620> both<00:03:55.799> not<00:03:56.070> gonna<00:03:56.190> be

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
Ecuador Honduras are both not gonna be

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:57.860 
Ecuador Honduras are both not gonna be
making<00:03:56.400> it<00:03:56.640> in<00:03:57.060> Group<00:03:57.239> F<00:03:57.390> guys<00:03:57.690> have

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870 
making it in Group F guys have

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:00.170 
making it in Group F guys have
Argentinian<00:03:58.560> obviously<00:03:59.070> making<00:03:59.370> it<00:03:59.489> just<00:03:59.970> you

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
Argentinian obviously making it just you

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:01.580 
Argentinian obviously making it just you
know<00:04:00.269> powerhouse<00:04:00.690> in<00:04:00.840> that<00:04:00.930> group<00:04:01.109> and<00:04:01.260> I

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
know powerhouse in that group and I

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:03.110 
know powerhouse in that group and I
Boston<00:04:02.070> I<00:04:02.130> getting<00:04:02.340> that<00:04:02.400> second<00:04:02.730> place<00:04:02.850> spot

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
Boston I getting that second place spot

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.330 
Boston I getting that second place spot
I<00:04:03.150> think<00:04:03.209> Boston<00:04:03.720> has<00:04:03.840> more<00:04:04.019> depth<00:04:04.290> more<00:04:04.560> just

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
I think Boston has more depth more just

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:06.590 
I think Boston has more depth more just
good<00:04:05.519> players<00:04:05.760> throughout<00:04:06.000> the<00:04:06.150> team<00:04:06.329> then<00:04:06.570> I

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:06.600 
good players throughout the team then I

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:09.470 
good players throughout the team then I
either<00:04:07.140> Iran<00:04:07.739> or<00:04:07.950> Nigeria<00:04:08.250> in<00:04:08.820> Group<00:04:09.060> G<00:04:09.090> guys

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
either Iran or Nigeria in Group G guys

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.180 
either Iran or Nigeria in Group G guys
this<00:04:09.750> is<00:04:09.870> obviously<00:04:10.140> really<00:04:10.290> tough<00:04:10.590> one<00:04:10.769> but<00:04:11.010> I

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.190 
this is obviously really tough one but I

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:13.160 
this is obviously really tough one but I
think<00:04:11.519> I<00:04:11.579> gotta<00:04:11.760> go<00:04:11.820> with<00:04:12.030> the<00:04:12.209> favorites<00:04:12.989> here

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:13.170 
think I gotta go with the favorites here

tough<00:05:12.539> for<00:05:12.719> them<00:05:12.810> to<00:05:12.930> repeat<00:05:13.289> World<00:05:13.800> Cup

00:05:13.939 --> 00:05:13.949 
tough for them to repeat World Cup

00:05:13.949 --> 00:05:15.260 
tough for them to repeat World Cup
finals<00:05:14.370> plus<00:05:14.610> with<00:05:14.759> the<00:05:14.849> Euro<00:05:15.030> Cup

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:17.250 
championship Netherlands I don't really

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:19.010 
championship Netherlands I don't really
like<00:05:17.460> their<00:05:17.639> defense<00:05:18.120> Brazil<00:05:18.539> being<00:05:18.719> the<00:05:18.810> host

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:19.020 
like their defense Brazil being the host

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:21.260 
like their defense Brazil being the host
during<00:05:19.590> when<00:05:19.680> you<00:05:19.740> just<00:05:19.919> being<00:05:20.490> such<00:05:20.819> a<00:05:20.849> solid

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:21.270 
during when you just being such a solid

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:22.430 
during when you just being such a solid
team<00:05:21.419> throughout<00:05:21.719> I<00:05:21.810> think<00:05:22.020> those<00:05:22.139> two<00:05:22.319> teams

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:22.440 
team throughout I think those two teams

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:24.529 
team throughout I think those two teams
we're<00:05:22.650> playing<00:05:22.860> the<00:05:22.949> finals<00:05:23.340> and<00:05:23.460> then<00:05:24.030> the
