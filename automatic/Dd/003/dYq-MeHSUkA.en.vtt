00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.950 
hi hi I'm here so what I'm gonna do in
this<00:00:12.900> video<00:00:13.110> is<00:00:13.320> just<00:00:13.530> a<00:00:13.889> little<00:00:14.160> burn<00:00:14.370> test

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:14.960 
this video is just a little burn test

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:17.840 
this video is just a little burn test
see<00:00:15.960> how<00:00:16.139> that<00:00:16.320> the<00:00:16.440> tonka<00:00:16.920> alcohol<00:00:17.490> burner

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
see how that the tonka alcohol burner

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.160 
see how that the tonka alcohol burner
compares<00:00:18.420> to<00:00:18.720> a<00:00:18.750> trans<00:00:19.260> year<00:00:19.590> burner<00:00:20.960> both<00:00:21.960> of

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
compares to a trans year burner both of

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.970 
compares to a trans year burner both of
them<00:00:22.289> were<00:00:22.470> burned<00:00:22.859> dry<00:00:24.500> this<00:00:25.500> one<00:00:25.710> on<00:00:25.859> the

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
them were burned dry this one on the

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.990 
them were burned dry this one on the
Tatanka<00:00:26.640> I<00:00:26.849> went<00:00:27.420> through<00:00:27.689> eight<00:00:27.900> ounces<00:00:28.800> of

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:29.000 
Tatanka I went through eight ounces of

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.870 
Tatanka I went through eight ounces of
methanol<00:00:30.000> in<00:00:30.210> this<00:00:30.590> to<00:00:31.590> make<00:00:31.769> sure<00:00:32.009> in<00:00:32.489> the

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
methanol in this to make sure in the

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.000 
methanol in this to make sure in the
past<00:00:33.120> I've<00:00:33.480> seen<00:00:34.200> and<00:00:34.440> I<00:00:34.500> haven't<00:00:34.739> been<00:00:34.860> able

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
past I've seen and I haven't been able

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.819 
past I've seen and I haven't been able
to<00:00:35.100> prove<00:00:35.370> it<00:00:35.550> yet<00:00:35.760> but<00:00:36.510> when<00:00:36.660> I<00:00:36.690> use<00:00:36.989> a<00:00:37.020> brand

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
to prove it yet but when I use a brand

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.549 
to prove it yet but when I use a brand
new<00:00:38.040> Trangia<00:00:38.670> it<00:00:39.480> doesn't<00:00:39.930> perform<00:00:40.079> as<00:00:40.500> well

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
new Trangia it doesn't perform as well

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.310 
new Trangia it doesn't perform as well
as<00:00:40.829> a<00:00:41.550> trans<00:00:42.059> year<00:00:42.270> than<00:00:42.480> I've<00:00:42.600> been<00:00:42.629> using<00:00:43.050> for

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
as a trans year than I've been using for

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.100 
as a trans year than I've been using for
a<00:00:43.559> while<00:00:43.820> it<00:00:44.820> seems<00:00:45.149> like<00:00:45.360> there's<00:00:45.570> a<00:00:45.629> break-in

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
a while it seems like there's a break-in

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.670 
a while it seems like there's a break-in
period<00:00:46.520> so<00:00:47.520> to<00:00:47.579> make<00:00:47.789> these<00:00:48.000> even<00:00:48.360> I<00:00:48.690> ran<00:00:49.350> eight

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
period so to make these even I ran eight

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.830 
period so to make these even I ran eight
ounces<00:00:50.219> of<00:00:50.280> fluid<00:00:50.820> ounces<00:00:51.239> of<00:00:51.420> methanol

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
ounces of fluid ounces of methanol

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.600 
ounces of fluid ounces of methanol
through<00:00:52.110> this<00:00:52.260> burner<00:00:52.590> before<00:00:52.920> I<00:00:53.160> do<00:00:53.280> this

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
through this burner before I do this

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.240 
through this burner before I do this
test<00:00:54.500> so<00:00:55.500> there's<00:00:55.739> one<00:00:55.949> ounce

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
test so there's one ounce

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.340 
test so there's one ounce
they're<00:00:56.760> both<00:00:57.030> burned<00:00:57.329> out<00:00:57.539> there's<00:00:58.199> one

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
they're both burned out there's one

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.389 
they're both burned out there's one
ounce<00:00:58.680> of<00:00:58.980> methanol<00:00:59.579> at<00:00:59.789> each<00:00:59.910> one<00:01:00.180> of<00:01:00.270> them

00:01:01.389 --> 00:01:01.399 
ounce of methanol at each one of them

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:08.660 
ounce of methanol at each one of them
let<00:01:02.399> me<00:01:02.430> like<00:01:02.699> this<00:01:04.790> now<00:01:05.790> I'm<00:01:05.970> trying<00:01:06.360> a<00:01:07.670> new

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
let me like this now I'm trying a new

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.590 
let me like this now I'm trying a new
camera<00:01:09.030> too<00:01:10.580> so<00:01:11.580> I'm<00:01:11.700> hoping<00:01:12.090> that<00:01:12.150> this<00:01:12.390> will

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
camera too so I'm hoping that this will

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.480 
camera too so I'm hoping that this will
show<00:01:12.960> up<00:01:13.110> on<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.350> camera<00:01:13.710> if<00:01:13.799> not<00:01:14.070> I'll<00:01:14.250> stay

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
show up on the camera if not I'll stay

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.910 
show up on the camera if not I'll stay
with<00:01:14.670> camera<00:01:15.150> one<00:01:17.659> you<00:01:18.659> can<00:01:18.840> see<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:19.619> Trangia

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
with camera one you can see the Trangia

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.620 
with camera one you can see the Trangia
came<00:01:20.610> to<00:01:20.820> bloom<00:01:21.060> a<00:01:21.210> little<00:01:21.240> bit<00:01:21.509> before<00:01:23.630> now

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
came to bloom a little bit before now

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.030 
came to bloom a little bit before now
one<00:01:24.810> thing<00:01:24.960> I've<00:01:25.080> been<00:01:25.110> thinking<00:01:25.229> about<00:01:25.560> is<00:01:25.830> if

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
one thing I've been thinking about is if

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.319 
one thing I've been thinking about is if
you<00:01:26.220> fill<00:01:26.549> the<00:01:27.479> tatanka<00:01:28.229> burner<00:01:28.500> with<00:01:29.490> alcohol

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
you fill the tatanka burner with alcohol

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.569 
you fill the tatanka burner with alcohol
it's<00:01:31.140> going<00:01:31.350> to<00:01:31.409> take<00:01:31.590> longer<00:01:31.920> to<00:01:32.100> warm<00:01:32.310> up

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
it's going to take longer to warm up

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.510 
it's going to take longer to warm up
than<00:01:33.180> the<00:01:33.390> Trangia<00:01:33.689> both<00:01:34.650> of<00:01:34.829> these<00:01:34.920> only<00:01:35.280> have

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
than the Trangia both of these only have

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.940 
than the Trangia both of these only have
one<00:01:35.909> fluid<00:01:36.329> ounce<00:01:36.479> in<00:01:36.750> them<00:01:36.869> so<00:01:37.619> that's<00:01:37.740> gonna

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
one fluid ounce in them so that's gonna

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.690 
one fluid ounce in them so that's gonna
make<00:01:38.189> a<00:01:38.220> bit<00:01:38.460> of<00:01:38.579> a<00:01:38.640> difference<00:01:39.090> in<00:01:39.270> time<00:01:40.700> this

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
make a bit of a difference in time this

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.389 
make a bit of a difference in time this
is<00:01:41.850> what<00:01:42.030> it<00:01:42.150> did<00:01:42.390> on<00:01:42.600> the<00:01:42.689> Tatanka<00:01:43.560> it's<00:01:44.130> been

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
is what it did on the Tatanka it's been

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:49.609 
is what it did on the Tatanka it's been
burning<00:01:44.670> pure<00:01:45.240> yellow<00:01:47.270> I<00:01:48.290> don't<00:01:49.290> know<00:01:49.380> if<00:01:49.500> it's

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.910 
burning pure yellow I don't know if it's
whatever<00:01:49.860> the<00:01:50.070> liner<00:01:50.430> is<00:01:50.729> inside<00:01:51.470> but<00:01:52.470> it<00:01:52.649> just

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.469 
whatever the liner is inside but it just
burns<00:01:53.189> yellow<00:01:54.259> oops<00:01:55.259> I<00:01:55.439> forgot

we'll see what it does with eight with
one<00:02:01.829> ounce<00:02:01.979> of<00:02:02.280> methanol<00:02:02.850> each

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:01.440 
of them did have one fluid ounce of
methanol<00:02:59.440> in<00:02:59.500> there<00:02:59.890> it<00:03:00.610> could<00:03:00.880> mean<00:03:01.120> that<00:03:01.180> the

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
methanol in there it could mean that the

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.110 
methanol in there it could mean that the
Trangia<00:03:01.720> is<00:03:02.050> burning<00:03:02.410> a<00:03:02.500> little<00:03:02.620> bit<00:03:02.800> hotter

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
Trangia is burning a little bit hotter

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.700 
Trangia is burning a little bit hotter
it<00:03:04.120> would<00:03:04.270> actually<00:03:04.660> be<00:03:04.780> a<00:03:04.810> little<00:03:04.990> extra<00:03:05.230> time

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:05.710 
it would actually be a little extra time

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:07.170 
it would actually be a little extra time
here<00:03:05.740> because<00:03:06.340> I<00:03:06.430> didn't<00:03:06.670> turn<00:03:06.820> this<00:03:06.940> on<00:03:07.150> right

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
here because I didn't turn this on right

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.020 
here because I didn't turn this on right
away<00:03:07.510> but<00:03:07.690> in<00:03:08.680> relation<00:03:09.220> to<00:03:09.250> each<00:03:09.400> other

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
away but in relation to each other

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:15.150 
away but in relation to each other
the<00:03:10.750> Trangia<00:03:11.200> ran<00:03:11.770> out<00:03:11.980> first<00:03:13.350> the<00:03:14.350> flames<00:03:14.800> on

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.160 
the Trangia ran out first the flames on

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.600 
the Trangia ran out first the flames on
the<00:03:15.220> Tatanka<00:03:16.290> were<00:03:17.290> really<00:03:17.860> really<00:03:18.280> really

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:18.610 
the Tatanka were really really really

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:21.060 
the Tatanka were really really really
yellow<00:03:19.270> in<00:03:19.510> the<00:03:19.660> beginning<00:03:20.080> now<00:03:20.590> there's<00:03:20.860> some

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:21.070 
yellow in the beginning now there's some

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:22.680 
yellow in the beginning now there's some
hoping<00:03:21.580> it'll<00:03:21.700> show<00:03:21.970> up<00:03:22.060> on<00:03:22.210> the<00:03:22.300> camera

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
hoping it'll show up on the camera

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:28.250 
hoping it'll show up on the camera
there's<00:03:23.350> some<00:03:23.650> blue<00:03:23.950> coming<00:03:24.250> out<00:03:24.520> here<00:03:26.130> but<00:03:27.130> I

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
there's some blue coming out here but I

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.030 
there's some blue coming out here but I
don't<00:03:29.260> know<00:03:29.320> if<00:03:29.410> this<00:03:29.530> is<00:03:29.560> the<00:03:29.740> way<00:03:29.860> it'll

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.040 
don't know if this is the way it'll

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:32.580 
don't know if this is the way it'll
always<00:03:30.370> burn<00:03:30.610> yellow<00:03:31.090> versus<00:03:31.630> the<00:03:31.870> nice<00:03:32.230> blue

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
always burn yellow versus the nice blue

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:35.730 
always burn yellow versus the nice blue
on<00:03:32.800> the<00:03:32.920> Trangia<00:03:33.690> if<00:03:34.690> anybody<00:03:35.140> has<00:03:35.380> it<00:03:35.590> to

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:35.740 
on the Trangia if anybody has it to

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:38.100 
on the Trangia if anybody has it to
tanka<00:03:36.190> let<00:03:37.000> me<00:03:37.120> know<00:03:37.270> what<00:03:37.450> kind<00:03:37.660> of<00:03:37.750> color

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:38.110 
tanka let me know what kind of color

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:41.820 
tanka let me know what kind of color
they<00:03:38.350> get<00:03:38.560> out<00:03:38.680> of<00:03:38.830> theirs<00:03:39.450> using<00:03:40.830> denatured

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:41.830 
they get out of theirs using denatured

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:47.310 
they get out of theirs using denatured
alcohol<00:03:41.980> or<00:03:42.490> methanol<00:03:45.450> mm-hmm<00:03:46.450> so<00:03:46.780> I<00:03:46.990> don't

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:47.320 
alcohol or methanol mm-hmm so I don't

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:51.150 
alcohol or methanol mm-hmm so I don't
know<00:03:47.380> still<00:03:48.070> burning<00:03:48.490> I<00:03:48.610> don't<00:03:49.530> know<00:03:50.530> if<00:03:50.680> I<00:03:50.830> see

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:51.160 
know still burning I don't know if I see

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.130 
know still burning I don't know if I see
any<00:03:51.400> alcohol<00:03:52.000> on<00:03:52.210> the<00:03:52.300> bottom<00:03:52.660> it<00:03:52.810> might<00:03:52.840> just

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:53.140 
any alcohol on the bottom it might just

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:55.830 
any alcohol on the bottom it might just
be<00:03:53.230> running<00:03:53.650> out<00:03:53.770> on<00:03:54.610> what<00:03:55.000> wicking<00:03:55.480> there<00:03:55.690> is

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:55.840 
be running out on what wicking there is

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.570 
be running out on what wicking there is
in<00:03:56.020> here<00:03:56.260> now<00:03:56.740> there<00:03:56.920> will<00:03:57.040> be<00:03:57.100> a<00:03:57.220> little<00:03:57.430> bit

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:57.580 
in here now there will be a little bit

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:00.330 
in here now there will be a little bit
more<00:03:57.730> wicking<00:03:58.210> in<00:03:58.930> the<00:03:59.140> Tatanka<00:03:59.740> than<00:03:59.920> in<00:04:00.070> on

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:00.340 
more wicking in the Tatanka than in on

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:03.090 
more wicking in the Tatanka than in on
the<00:04:00.630> Trangia<00:04:01.630> because<00:04:02.260> of<00:04:02.410> the<00:04:02.500> height<00:04:02.710> of<00:04:02.980> the

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:03.100 
the Trangia because of the height of the

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:08.400 
the Trangia because of the height of the
burner<00:04:05.370> so<00:04:06.370> that<00:04:06.580> gives<00:04:06.790> us<00:04:06.940> an<00:04:07.120> idea<00:04:07.290> what<00:04:08.290> the

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:08.410 
burner so that gives us an idea what the

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:11.360 
burner so that gives us an idea what the
flames<00:04:08.680> look<00:04:08.980> like<00:04:09.190> between<00:04:09.490> these<00:04:09.790> two<00:04:10.090> and

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.370 
flames look like between these two and

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:14.700 
flames look like between these two and
maybe<00:04:12.570> which<00:04:13.570> one<00:04:13.810> might<00:04:14.050> be<00:04:14.080> burning<00:04:14.650> a

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:14.710 
maybe which one might be burning a

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:16.080 
maybe which one might be burning a
little<00:04:14.800> bit<00:04:14.950> hotter<00:04:15.220> and<00:04:15.490> using<00:04:15.850> up<00:04:15.970> the

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:16.090 
little bit hotter and using up the

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:20.130 
little bit hotter and using up the
alcohol<00:04:16.450> faster<00:04:17.200> I<00:04:18.210> guess<00:04:19.210> my<00:04:19.390> next<00:04:19.420> test<00:04:19.900> now

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:20.140 
alcohol faster I guess my next test now

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:23.550 
alcohol faster I guess my next test now
will<00:04:21.100> be<00:04:21.280> to<00:04:21.670> do<00:04:21.850> a<00:04:21.880> boil<00:04:22.240> test<00:04:22.660> using<00:04:23.530> the

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:23.560 
will be to do a boil test using the

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:27.780 
will be to do a boil test using the
Tatanka<00:04:24.250> on<00:04:24.520> its<00:04:24.820> stand<00:04:26.190> see<00:04:27.190> how<00:04:27.310> that<00:04:27.520> does

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:27.790 
Tatanka on its stand see how that does

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:29.820 
Tatanka on its stand see how that does
as<00:04:27.970> far<00:04:28.210> as<00:04:28.360> heating<00:04:28.690> up<00:04:28.810> I<00:04:29.050> was<00:04:29.500> also<00:04:29.800> thinking

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:29.830 
as far as heating up I was also thinking

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:31.830 
as far as heating up I was also thinking
I<00:04:30.280> might<00:04:30.460> have<00:04:30.610> to<00:04:30.730> do<00:04:30.850> another<00:04:31.090> test<00:04:31.420> after

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:31.840 
I might have to do another test after

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:35.370 
I might have to do another test after
that<00:04:32.050> using<00:04:32.890> the<00:04:33.220> Trangia<00:04:33.520> in<00:04:34.390> the<00:04:34.750> Tatanka

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:35.380 
that using the Trangia in the Tatanka

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:39.000 
that using the Trangia in the Tatanka
pot<00:04:35.830> stand<00:04:36.220> just<00:04:37.180> like<00:04:37.330> the<00:04:37.510> actual<00:04:38.380> do<00:04:38.590> actual

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:39.010 
pot stand just like the actual do actual

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:42.100 
pot stand just like the actual do actual
comparing<00:04:39.550> there<00:04:40.890> but

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:42.110 
comparing there but

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:43.750 
comparing there but
there<00:04:42.320> we<00:04:42.410> have<00:04:42.590> a<00:04:42.620> flame<00:04:43.010> test<00:04:43.340> and<00:04:43.640> it's

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:43.760 
there we have a flame test and it's

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:47.230 
there we have a flame test and it's
still<00:04:43.970> going<00:04:45.220> getting<00:04:46.220> bluer<00:04:46.490> as<00:04:46.790> it<00:04:46.970> comes

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:47.240 
still going getting bluer as it comes

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:48.640 
still going getting bluer as it comes
down<00:04:47.450> I<00:04:47.510> don't<00:04:47.870> know<00:04:48.020> if<00:04:48.140> it's<00:04:48.290> that<00:04:48.500> it's

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:48.650 
down I don't know if it's that it's

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:51.100 
down I don't know if it's that it's
burning<00:04:49.010> out<00:04:49.130> what's<00:04:49.400> in<00:04:49.640> there<00:04:49.850> or<00:04:50.720> if

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:51.110 
burning out what's in there or if

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:53.140 
burning out what's in there or if
getting<00:04:51.470> lower<00:04:51.830> on<00:04:52.100> the<00:04:52.220> alcohol<00:04:52.700> makes<00:04:52.970> it

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:53.150 
getting lower on the alcohol makes it

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:55.810 
getting lower on the alcohol makes it
burn<00:04:54.050> see<00:04:54.440> now<00:04:54.620> it's<00:04:54.770> almost<00:04:54.980> completely<00:04:55.460> blue

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:55.820 
burn see now it's almost completely blue

00:04:55.820 --> 00:05:03.070 
burn see now it's almost completely blue
I<00:04:58.510> don't<00:04:59.510> see<00:05:00.020> any<00:05:00.200> alcohol<00:05:00.650> in<00:05:00.800> there<00:05:02.080> another

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:03.080 
I don't see any alcohol in there another

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:06.850 
I don't see any alcohol in there another
thing<00:05:03.230> here<00:05:04.130> I<00:05:04.310> try<00:05:05.150> not<00:05:05.330> to<00:05:05.480> let<00:05:05.630> my<00:05:05.860> Trangia

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:06.860 
thing here I try not to let my Trangia

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:10.450 
thing here I try not to let my Trangia
run<00:05:07.400> out<00:05:07.640> to<00:05:08.330> burn<00:05:08.600> out<00:05:08.810> I<00:05:09.050> have<00:05:10.010> a<00:05:10.040> feeling

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:10.460 
run out to burn out I have a feeling

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:12.730 
run out to burn out I have a feeling
that's<00:05:10.640> what's<00:05:10.850> causing<00:05:11.120> the<00:05:11.420> cracking<00:05:11.930> when

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:12.740
