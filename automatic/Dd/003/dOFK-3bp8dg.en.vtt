00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.520
 these lice, there is no one to hold them 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.520
 the artist career is this 

00:00:09.219 --> 00:00:10.619
 an object 

00:00:10.619 --> 00:00:13.149
 it is intended to be a wonderful musical instrument 

00:00:13.149 --> 00:00:15.579
 that usually has four orders 

00:00:15.579 --> 00:00:16.659
 because in the doubles 

00:00:16.659 --> 00:00:20.640
 8 7 strings ie the first followed the first double 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.199
 that of changing between 7 and 8 

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:25.789
 the renaissance guitar 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:28.720
 I think it's related to smallpox, obviously the first one in 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:32.419
 times in which is intervened by order of the vihuela that reached up to 7 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:33.210
 hours 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.260
 the guitar one only had 4 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.630
 in fact the first Baroque guitar still had four orders as the 

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:39.900
 to close the crisis 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.530
 and I'll expand it to five 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.790
 when the scenario eventually get in the way the last boat called the 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:49.210
 late classicism and starting 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:51.139
 almost always romanticism 

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:53.030
 when I came back late it was added 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.030
 the sixth and sometimes even a seventh body 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:59.190
 curd bonds 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.950
 curd percent because animated 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:04.280
 good that text 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.540
 this summer but it was taken because not only for everything and all men 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:10.870
 has a decorative pike I do not know why people have been made 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:13.440
 in Navarre agree how the instruments of this era 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.790
 habitually 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:20.730
 and this process pegbox shaped like leaves and pointed very close to the height of the 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:23.680
 tremendous pegs that I bought to order 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.650
 I was not me, we're going down 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:30.230
 is a small guitar as you can see that it did not prevent a length of 

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:32.750
 vibrant leather 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:33.780
 until 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.500
 well approximately 2 soon 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.610
 It is important 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:41.230
 one was normal 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:44.230
 who loses 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:47.870
 66 drenthe 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.310
 the winslet ana 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.310
 a dance I think 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.070
 I do not think that I do not fit flamenco flamenco not flanders 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:01.020
 b out there 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.020
 Renaissance of 1400 and few g 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:08.500
 not in vain
