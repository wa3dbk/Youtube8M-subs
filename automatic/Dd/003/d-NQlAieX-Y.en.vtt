00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 save save br guys are all very 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:07.080
 welcome to the most remarkable here on the channel 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.870
 and as you can see from the bottom it's kind of 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.790
 a guide and cleidson made icann and a 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.400
 poll all together and mixed because I 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.360
 I did not want to leave a bottom with nothing to 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.910
 look right 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.770
 well our poll is the following you give 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.900
 value in your game 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.730
 This is the topic of the poll. This is what I 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.519
 I would like to know a little bit about 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.170
 you or sicme is here on youtube 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.320
 you already know that we have a diversity 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.030
 very large of games available 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.100
 the business is the following most 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.010
 Sometimes the person does not value that game. 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.140
 or simply to value that content 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.550
 because he was able to get it was provided 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.340
 for free 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.770
 if you catch the same game you go there and 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.629
 buy the game you will play more 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.079
 that game than if you can 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:54.510
 that same game for free 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:57.270
 I have realized this because it is in the 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.120
 latest releases that have emerged from the 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:03.210
 person sometimes waits for launch 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:06.510
 Arise brow goes there and buys the game and 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:08.460
 play the game online what happens is 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:12.090
 leaving a little emphasis 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:14.310
 360 will talk ruby pony - following the 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:17.460
 360 is already at the end of life 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.930
 we already have xbox one available 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.869
 Good people, what do I have to say to you? 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:25.710
 You the next one in the background are you 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:27.659
 actually seeing a me playing or gta5 on 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.790
 xbox the year is sure I was testing 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.950
 here are some games that I get 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.049
 recently to be able to test and make the 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.790
 mp of content so I'm doing 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:38.909
 here in the background for you 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:41.009
 guys this year and 1 year ago I 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:43.200
 I believe that most games 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.790
 especially last year this year 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.310
 is starting the game grid now 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.829
 last year we did not have 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.990
 most games that came out for xbox one 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:54.689
 we had for 360 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.790
 if you are to calculate the question of 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:58.590
 values were you have a rh you go 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.229
 get everything for free 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.719
 and you end up not playing you do not give 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:04.259
 value to the content that is provided by eng 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.299
 H 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:09.300
 I say this I say on a plateau in 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:10.679
 general is in the content of emulators in the 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.500
 dawn update 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:15.150
 the galley understands all this content 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.370
 there are people who dedicated themselves to 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.680
 provide this for free people 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:22.560
 have stopped doing other activities to 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.360
 power is doing it for you 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.610
 make it available to you in a 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.290
 free 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:30.330
 but what happens the person gets a 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.620
 game that will cost 16 200 reais 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.959
 two hundred and fifty reais 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:36.420
 free of charge and it does not give the 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:38.400
 That game said that the game is not good. 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.560
 said the game did not work cool says 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:43.230
 which game is this here another three 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.540
 weeks after you alleyway playing type 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:48.030
 on live on line a game like it was 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:50.130
 there in the commentary and 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:52.790
 understood then I realized that the person only 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:55.610
 gives value in the game if she buys she pays 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:58.920
 this has done what is the devaluation 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:02.400
 not only the console but the content itself 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:03.900
 there has been a drop in players on 360 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.959
 A lot of people are failing to play in the 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:09.120
 link to popular power you have as the ps3 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:11.640
 occurred in many cases and other 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:14.520
 people stop playing for power 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:17.310
 pc left the back here beauty or can 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:21.150
 rain often have many 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:23.310
 people have left there is to play is not 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:25.890
 It's filling to go to the pc to sting. 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:29.070
 to go to order you mean so 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:32.370
 other content because the game 

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:33.930
 ends up becoming cheap on xbox one we 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:36.360
 we have the possibilities of you 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:39.360
 can play games there at a price 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:41.730
 affordable type 30 reais 20 reais 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:44.010
 some hot but very good air games 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:45.030
 very well worked, which is the case with 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:46.620
 hÃ³ri type 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:49.290
 the oil is costing thirty-nine reais 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:51.690
 and a cool new generation game 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:55.110
 that even rumors that will come out also for 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:57.269
 the 360 good but the topic of our poll is 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:59.430
 you give value in your type game how much 

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:01.590
 Do you think your game is worth? 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:03.720
 if you buy the game you play a lot 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:06.480
 if you have there in your hd without games you 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:08.850
 type jumps from game and game and finishes 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:10.890
 not playing anything this is what i walk 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:12.510
 Seeing that's what I'm going through 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:15.120
 often put on the net 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:19.079
 social port playing here so places up 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:21.299
 game fotinho and does not play type only that is 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:23.310
 that there is a lot and not 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:25.200
 enjoy anything from the console 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:27.420
 sometimes the console spends more time on the 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:29.310
 shelf than the guy playing in 

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:32.730
 but if he buys an original game 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:34.890
 it comes with a kinect tennis game o 

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:38.700
 just because the original game it will stay 

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:40.710
 type 12 15 hours a day playing has 

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:43.110
 Winter is expensive has 24 hours a 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:45.000
 playing day is a game just because he 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:46.860
 is an original game then the 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.750
 following guys that you are at home and 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:51.240
 I would like to know very much the opinion of 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:53.670
 You guys about if you value your game. 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:55.980
 or simply if you value your 

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:56.820
 console on if you throw it if you do not 

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:58.500
 play 

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:00.990
 Okay, let's not understand this here. 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:02.370
 be a somewhat challenging poll is 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:05.010
 It's logical because we want to know 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:07.170
 really what with your opinion the 

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:08.940
 Do you think the audience that we 

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:10.290
 is achieving this is a legal content 

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:13.290
 because I like to create a 

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:14.760
 interactivity here with the subscribers is 

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:18.120
 Another thing I wanted to know was the 

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:19.770
 next you have to know what it is when 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:21.990
 you get content in a way 

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:24.240
 free you sometimes do not give the value 

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:26.400
 and this is what I want to open the 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:28.080
 It's not like that. 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:29.910
 content that is provided to you 

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:30.720
 that there was no one who 

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:32.340
 dedicated 

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:33.600
 someone who even stopped working and 

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:35.910
 earn some money to be able 

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:37.680
 provide you with what you have 

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:39.840
 stop and take a look and reflect a 

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:42.630
 little else is good and kind of 

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:44.550
 so nothing to swear to 

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:46.620
 bossa nova is missing wait the 

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:47.970
 content is still in type so test 

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:50.160
 to improve 

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:52.170
 years since it does not exist 

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:54.510
 more update for freestyle then 

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:57.270
 it means a lot has happened 

00:05:54.510 --> 00:06:00.030
 in recent years and sometimes the user 

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:03.990
 always starts busy because it does not give 

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:05.970
 an incentive to people doing this 

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:08.010
 kind of work that is people of the 

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:10.470
 region that in my opinion is a 

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:14.280
 great work going on year 

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:15.930
 after good year but the following guys leave 

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:18.330
 here below in the comments I would like 

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:20.220
 to know what you think about the 

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:22.620
 How much is your game worth your 

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:24.960
 console if you actually play the game 

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:27.990
 beauty or if you are one of those guys who 

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:30.210
 type just because I have cost 999 reais 

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:32.460
 he is the top of the galaxies he has in this 

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:34.080
 Horrible cold right just because it is expensive 

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:35.820
 You put on your chest, go to the mall. 

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:37.590
 thinking that you work healthy and 

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:39.120
 truth is not all that 

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:40.240
 You're a guy who values ââwhat you do. 

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:42.400
 Are you a going guy? 

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:43.750
 so its console and the diversity of 

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:45.759
 games he has 

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:48.580
 or you're a guy who values ââthe game 

00:06:45.759 --> 00:06:50.650
 for the price is for possession or simply 

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:52.090
 because the game is pushing 250 reais 

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:54.699
 You go there and buy the game only for 

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:56.110
 say you have a game and you also do not play 

00:06:54.699 --> 00:06:59.500
 the content if you can get it 

00:06:56.110 --> 00:07:01.780
 free of charge and has the same 

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:04.000
 in the game that you could buy or use 

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:06.490
 money for another purpose do not know 

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.590
 so in your opinion it compensates not 

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:12.130
 It pays to have a 

00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:14.380
 interesting you are cool is not what you 

00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:17.199
 do you really think of urgh you think 

00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:18.699
 value you think you do not value or 

00:07:17.199 --> 00:07:21.009
 You just think the game to 

00:07:18.699 --> 00:07:23.620
 You're worthless because it's about 

00:07:21.009 --> 00:07:26.289
 of a game that to run in the region of 

00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:27.759
 beauty finally let down then your 

00:07:26.289 --> 00:07:29.409
 comment your opinion on our 

00:07:27.759 --> 00:07:31.750
 This week's poll for us to 

00:07:29.409 --> 00:07:34.150

00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:36.310
 of the public and the user question that 

00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:38.650
 accompanies us here on youtube beauty 

00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:40.330
 chicken I'm going to stay here I want 

00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:44.759
