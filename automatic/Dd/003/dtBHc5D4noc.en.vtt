it prices at the minute make no

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:50.749 
it prices at the minute make no
difference<00:01:49.770> it<00:01:50.070> just<00:01:50.220> depends<00:01:50.520> how<00:01:50.610> much

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
difference it just depends how much

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.389 
difference it just depends how much
coins<00:01:51.149> people<00:01:52.020> have<00:01:52.200> on<00:01:52.710> the<00:01:52.829> day<00:01:52.979> but<00:01:53.040> there's

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
coins people have on the day but there's

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.069 
coins people have on the day but there's
literally<00:01:53.700> ordered<00:01:54.119> all<00:01:54.509> that<00:01:54.720> is<00:01:54.869> you<00:01:55.020> know

literally ordered all that is you know

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.109 
literally ordered all that is you know
there's<00:01:55.320> no<00:01:55.409> logic<00:01:55.829> behind<00:01:56.009> players<00:01:56.700> prices

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
there's no logic behind players prices

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.910 
there's no logic behind players prices
at<00:01:57.240> the<00:01:57.329> minute<00:01:57.570> so<00:01:57.780> prices<00:01:58.350> aren't<00:01:58.649> really

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
at the minute so prices aren't really

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.889 
at the minute so prices aren't really
important<00:01:59.219> i<00:01:59.280> think<00:01:59.310> this<00:01:59.520> squads<00:01:59.820> about<00:02:00.060> 800
