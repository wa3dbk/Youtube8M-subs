00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.839 
NAB yeah so our new product for this
show<00:00:28.410> I<00:00:28.439> guess<00:00:28.710> you'd<00:00:28.830> say<00:00:28.859> is<00:00:29.160> our<00:00:29.279> new<00:00:29.519> unit

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
show I guess you'd say is our new unit

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.669 
show I guess you'd say is our new unit

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.139 
drive 3 access control system originally
we're<00:00:31.830> going<00:00:31.949> to<00:00:32.009> do<00:00:32.099> a<00:00:32.130> one<00:00:32.399> axis<00:00:32.759> digital

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
we're going to do a one axis digital

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.510 
we're going to do a one axis digital
control<00:00:33.450> for<00:00:33.690> our<00:00:33.780> parallax<00:00:34.350> device<00:00:34.710> mostly

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
control for our parallax device mostly

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.250 
control for our parallax device mostly
just<00:00:35.700> for<00:00:35.820> looping<00:00:36.210> but<00:00:36.690> when<00:00:36.840> I<00:00:36.870> took<00:00:37.050> a<00:00:37.170> step

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
just for looping but when I took a step

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.470 
just for looping but when I took a step
further<00:00:37.620> made<00:00:37.950> it<00:00:38.070> a<00:00:38.129> three<00:00:38.370> axis<00:00:38.520> digital

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
further made it a three axis digital

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.670 
further made it a three axis digital
control<00:00:39.870> so<00:00:40.050> this<00:00:40.140> is<00:00:40.260> truly<00:00:40.879> closed-loop

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:42.680 
control so this is truly closed-loop

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.260 
control so this is truly closed-loop
digital<00:00:43.680> control<00:00:44.010> same<00:00:44.430> as<00:00:44.670> our<00:00:44.820> Sinha<00:00:45.030> Drive

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
digital control same as our Sinha Drive

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:46.700 
digital control same as our Sinha Drive
system<00:00:45.539> so<00:00:45.989> you're<00:00:46.110> gonna<00:00:46.200> have<00:00:46.350> the<00:00:46.379> same

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
system so you're gonna have the same

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.040 
system so you're gonna have the same
performance<00:00:47.030> smoothness<00:00:48.030> reliability<00:00:48.809> and

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
performance smoothness reliability and

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.889 
performance smoothness reliability and
repeatability<00:00:49.680> is<00:00:50.039> our<00:00:50.420> larger<00:00:51.420> Sinha<00:00:51.629> drive

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
repeatability is our larger Sinha drive

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.740 
repeatability is our larger Sinha drive
system<00:00:52.350> but<00:00:52.949> scale<00:00:53.219> down<00:00:53.399> super<00:00:54.329> easy<00:00:54.510> to<00:00:54.719> use

system $6.99 for the one axis system
which<00:01:09.900> is<00:01:10.020> I<00:01:10.110> that's<00:01:10.619> just<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.369> head<00:01:11.580> or

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
which is I that's just the the head or

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.149 
which is I that's just the the head or
is<00:01:11.939> that<00:01:12.060> yeah<00:01:12.659> so<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:12.900> head<00:01:13.080> would<00:01:13.229> be<00:01:13.409> you

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
is that yeah so the head would be you

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:15.710 
is that yeah so the head would be you
know<00:01:14.220> one<00:01:14.400> axis<00:01:14.670> is<00:01:14.760> a<00:01:14.790> slider<00:01:15.090> motor<00:01:15.360> which<00:01:15.570> is

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
know one axis is a slider motor which is

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.170 
know one axis is a slider motor which is
a<00:01:15.750> three-speed<00:01:16.259> slider<00:01:16.740> motor<00:01:17.040> so<00:01:17.400> unlike

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
a three-speed slider motor so unlike

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.640 
a three-speed slider motor so unlike
before<00:01:18.330> we<00:01:18.689> had<00:01:18.869> to<00:01:18.960> buy<00:01:19.049> different<00:01:19.320> motor

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
before we had to buy different motor

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.200 
before we had to buy different motor
gearing's<00:01:20.070> to<00:01:20.250> fit<00:01:20.400> different<00:01:20.490> application

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
gearing's to fit different application

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.760 
gearing's to fit different application
this<00:01:21.390> is<00:01:21.509> one<00:01:21.780> motor<00:01:22.020> you<00:01:22.170> just<00:01:22.320> change<00:01:22.590> out

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
this is one motor you just change out

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.109 
this is one motor you just change out
the<00:01:22.890> pulleys<00:01:23.220> as<00:01:23.369> a<00:01:23.400> quick<00:01:23.640> change<00:01:23.790> pulley

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
the pulleys as a quick change pulley

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.240 
the pulleys as a quick change pulley
system<00:01:24.450> on<00:01:24.570> it<00:01:24.720> so<00:01:25.470> that<00:01:25.590> saves<00:01:25.830> the<00:01:25.950> end-user

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
system on it so that saves the end-user

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.590 
system on it so that saves the end-user
time<00:01:26.549> and<00:01:26.759> money<00:01:26.880> there<00:01:27.090> from<00:01:27.299> renting<00:01:27.540> to

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
time and money there from renting to

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.830 
time and money there from renting to
switch<00:01:27.810> out<00:01:27.990> you<00:01:28.200> know<00:01:28.290> motors<00:01:28.790> and<00:01:29.790> then<00:01:30.540> you

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
switch out you know motors and then you

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.899 
switch out you know motors and then you
know<00:01:30.960> so<00:01:31.619> one<00:01:32.100> axe<00:01:32.250> this<00:01:32.340> would<00:01:32.490> be<00:01:32.579> just<00:01:32.790> a

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
know so one axe this would be just a

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.429 
know so one axe this would be just a
slider<00:01:33.119> motor<00:01:33.390> three<00:01:33.900> axes<00:01:34.170> would<00:01:34.320> be

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
slider motor three axes would be

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.429 
slider motor three axes would be
including<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.100> pan<00:01:35.310> and<00:01:35.460> tilt<00:01:35.610> head<00:01:36.439> all

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
including the pan and tilt head all

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:41.179 
including the pan and tilt head all
right<00:01:37.560> so<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:37.829> Sena<00:01:38.070> drive<00:01:39.799> has<00:01:40.799> this<00:01:40.979> crazy

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
right so the Sena drive has this crazy

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.510 
right so the Sena drive has this crazy
controller<00:01:41.729> also<00:01:42.119> you<00:01:42.570> can<00:01:42.689> see<00:01:42.840> it<00:01:42.960> behind<00:01:43.079> us

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:43.520 
controller also you can see it behind us

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.789 
controller also you can see it behind us
and<00:01:44.520> air<00:01:44.850> scan<00:01:45.090> tell<00:01:45.240> us<00:01:45.360> about<00:01:45.540> the<00:01:45.869> remote

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
and air scan tell us about the remote

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.280 
and air scan tell us about the remote
controlled<00:01:47.130> car<00:01:47.369> I<00:01:47.610> mean<00:01:47.880> the<00:01:48.869> controller

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
controlled car I mean the controller

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:50.929 
controlled car I mean the controller
yeah<00:01:49.439> interesting<00:01:49.710> yeah<00:01:50.220> so<00:01:50.369> obviously<00:01:50.520> Sena

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
yeah interesting yeah so obviously Sena

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.789 
yeah interesting yeah so obviously Sena
drives<00:01:51.180> not<00:01:51.329> new<00:01:51.600> but<00:01:51.960> we<00:01:52.110> keep<00:01:52.259> building<00:01:52.560> new

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
drives not new but we keep building new

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.980 
drives not new but we keep building new
things<00:01:52.829> for<00:01:53.340> so<00:01:53.520> obviously<00:01:53.820> we<00:01:53.970> have<00:01:54.000> a<00:01:54.570> whole

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
things for so obviously we have a whole

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.600 
things for so obviously we have a whole
new<00:01:55.140> software<00:01:55.530> for<00:01:55.649> the<00:01:55.740> show<00:01:55.950> three<00:01:56.369> point

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
new software for the show three point

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.219 
new software for the show three point
one<00:01:56.850> which<00:01:57.119> has<00:01:57.299> a<00:01:57.329> lot<00:01:57.540> of<00:01:57.659> amazing<00:01:57.869> features

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
one which has a lot of amazing features

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.260 
one which has a lot of amazing features
built<00:01:58.560> into<00:01:58.740> it<00:01:58.920> the<00:01:59.340> other<00:01:59.369> thing<00:02:00.060> that<00:02:00.090> our

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
built into it the other thing that our

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.819 
built into it the other thing that our
customers<00:02:00.719> and<00:02:00.869> users<00:02:01.020> were<00:02:01.229> was<00:02:01.320> requesting

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
customers and users were was requesting

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.490 
customers and users were was requesting
was<00:02:01.920> an<00:02:02.040> analog<00:02:02.610> interface<00:02:03.180> so<00:02:03.659> we<00:02:03.780> have<00:02:03.899> this

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
was an analog interface so we have this

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.170 
was an analog interface so we have this
is<00:02:04.680> three<00:02:04.920> axis<00:02:05.219> joystick<00:02:05.610> left<00:02:05.820> right<00:02:06.000> up<00:02:06.030> and

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
is three axis joystick left right up and

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.850 
is three axis joystick left right up and
down<00:02:06.270> twist<00:02:06.630> then<00:02:07.110> we<00:02:07.229> have<00:02:07.320> a<00:02:07.350> shift<00:02:07.619> which

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
down twist then we have a shift which

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.660 
down twist then we have a shift which
will<00:02:08.039> give<00:02:08.340> you<00:02:08.459> three<00:02:08.789> more<00:02:08.940> axes

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
will give you three more axes

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:12.270 
will give you three more axes
then<00:02:10.270> we<00:02:10.420> have<00:02:10.570> our<00:02:10.810> focus<00:02:11.620> and<00:02:11.740> jog<00:02:12.010> wheels

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
then we have our focus and jog wheels

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:13.890 
then we have our focus and jog wheels
and<00:02:12.490> these<00:02:12.580> just<00:02:12.790> magnetically<00:02:13.450> click<00:02:13.660> under

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
and these just magnetically click under

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.500 
and these just magnetically click under
the<00:02:13.930> cage<00:02:14.340> you<00:02:15.340> can<00:02:15.370> use<00:02:15.760> these<00:02:15.940> independently

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
the cage you can use these independently

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.480 
the cage you can use these independently
or<00:02:16.840> in<00:02:17.050> combination<00:02:17.260> with<00:02:17.740> the<00:02:17.860> joystick<00:02:18.310> so

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:18.490 
or in combination with the joystick so

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:19.590 
or in combination with the joystick so
it<00:02:18.550> just<00:02:18.670> gives<00:02:18.850> you<00:02:18.940> a<00:02:18.970> lot<00:02:19.150> of<00:02:19.180> hands-on

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:19.600 
it just gives you a lot of hands-on

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.320 
it just gives you a lot of hands-on
control<00:02:20.020> over<00:02:20.770> the<00:02:20.860> system<00:02:21.070> so<00:02:21.790> you<00:02:21.850> set<00:02:22.300> your

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
control over the system so you set your

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.250 
control over the system so you set your
lens<00:02:22.630> limits<00:02:23.590> and<00:02:24.310> then<00:02:24.490> they'll<00:02:24.880> light<00:02:25.210> up

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
lens limits and then they'll light up

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.900 
lens limits and then they'll light up
yellow<00:02:26.260> and<00:02:26.710> you<00:02:26.800> can<00:02:27.010> set<00:02:27.160> temporary<00:02:27.550> limits

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 
yellow and you can set temporary limits

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:30.000 
yellow and you can set temporary limits
inside<00:02:28.510> of<00:02:28.660> your<00:02:28.780> main<00:02:28.990> so<00:02:29.380> you<00:02:29.590> know<00:02:29.680> you<00:02:29.800> set

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
inside of your main so you know you set

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.580 
inside of your main so you know you set
focus<00:02:30.430> one<00:02:30.640> go<00:02:31.480> to<00:02:31.540> your<00:02:31.720> focus<00:02:32.020> 2<00:02:32.200> and<00:02:32.530> now

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
focus one go to your focus 2 and now

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.350 
focus one go to your focus 2 and now
when<00:02:32.770> you<00:02:32.800> pull<00:02:33.040> between<00:02:33.400> those<00:02:33.640> it<00:02:34.180> only

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
when you pull between those it only

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:38.460 
when you pull between those it only
limits<00:02:34.780> are<00:02:37.020> these<00:02:38.020> things<00:02:38.230> that<00:02:38.350> you're

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
limits are these things that you're

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.470 
limits are these things that you're
selling<00:02:38.920> separately<00:02:39.640> or<00:02:39.820> is<00:02:39.910> it<00:02:40.060> with<00:02:40.330> yeah

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
selling separately or is it with yeah

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:41.820 
selling separately or is it with yeah
these<00:02:40.630> are<00:02:40.780> all<00:02:40.900> components<00:02:41.260> they're<00:02:41.709> all

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:41.830 
these are all components they're all

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:44.490 
these are all components they're all
modular<00:02:42.280> components<00:02:42.910> of<00:02:43.000> 75<00:02:43.510> all<00:02:44.260> right<00:02:44.380> and

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
modular components of 75 all right and

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.290 
modular components of 75 all right and
here's<00:02:44.680> the<00:02:44.800> iPad<00:02:45.190> app<00:02:45.400> for<00:02:45.430> the<00:02:45.850> set<00:02:46.000> of<00:02:46.090> drive

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:46.300 
here's the iPad app for the set of drive

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:47.880 
here's the iPad app for the set of drive
so<00:02:46.930> you<00:02:46.959> can<00:02:47.170> see<00:02:47.290> here<00:02:47.470> we<00:02:47.560> have<00:02:47.680> a<00:02:47.709> full

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 
so you can see here we have a full

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:50.729 
so you can see here we have a full
graphical<00:02:48.459> display<00:02:49.050> these<00:02:50.050> lines<00:02:50.380> are<00:02:50.620> our

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:50.739 
graphical display these lines are our

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:52.650 
graphical display these lines are our
trajectories<00:02:51.459> and<00:02:51.640> those<00:02:51.790> dots<00:02:52.300> are<00:02:52.510> the

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
trajectories and those dots are the

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:54.090 
trajectories and those dots are the
keyframes<00:02:53.170> where<00:02:53.380> we<00:02:53.500> record<00:02:53.890> those

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:54.100 
keyframes where we record those

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:56.280 
keyframes where we record those
particular<00:02:54.430> points<00:02:55.060> so<00:02:55.510> you<00:02:55.540> get<00:02:55.780> you<00:02:56.140> can

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
particular points so you get you can

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:57.870 
particular points so you get you can
edit<00:02:56.440> you<00:02:56.980> know<00:02:57.100> the<00:02:57.190> move<00:02:57.340> with<00:02:57.550> a<00:02:57.610> curve

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880 
edit you know the move with a curve

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.449 
edit you know the move with a curve
that's<00:02:58.390> the<00:02:58.750> the<00:02:59.080> damping<00:02:59.500> quality<00:03:00.070> coming<00:03:00.370> in

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:00.459 
that's the the damping quality coming in

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:01.620 
that's the the damping quality coming in
to<00:03:00.550> those<00:03:00.670> points<00:03:01.090> you<00:03:01.180> can<00:03:01.330> move<00:03:01.450> its

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:01.630 
to those points you can move its

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:04.199 
to those points you can move its
position<00:03:02.410> by<00:03:02.709> pushing<00:03:03.520> and<00:03:03.730> holding<00:03:03.790> and

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:04.209 
position by pushing and holding and

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:05.670 
position by pushing and holding and
using<00:03:04.450> these<00:03:04.540> bump<00:03:04.840> buttons<00:03:05.200> to<00:03:05.440> move<00:03:05.620> the

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
using these bump buttons to move the

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.620 
using these bump buttons to move the
position<00:03:06.190> those<00:03:06.370> particular<00:03:06.670> keyframes<00:03:07.330> you

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:07.630 
position those particular keyframes you

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:09.390 
position those particular keyframes you
have<00:03:07.930> full<00:03:08.110> control<00:03:08.290> over<00:03:08.530> everything<00:03:09.070> its

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:09.400 
have full control over everything its

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.640 
have full control over everything its
position<00:03:09.940> how<00:03:10.570> it<00:03:10.750> moves<00:03:10.930> the<00:03:11.200> runtime

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
position how it moves the runtime

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:14.370 
position how it moves the runtime
time-lapse<00:03:12.280> stop-motion<00:03:13.090> we<00:03:13.840> now<00:03:13.959> just<00:03:14.200> built

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:14.380 
time-lapse stop-motion we now just built

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:17.850 
time-lapse stop-motion we now just built
in<00:03:14.500> this<00:03:14.640> analog<00:03:15.640> interface<00:03:16.269> as<00:03:16.510> well<00:03:16.780> so<00:03:17.620> this

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:17.860 
in this analog interface as well so this

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:19.949 
in this analog interface as well so this
could<00:03:18.070> be<00:03:18.100> your<00:03:18.220> focus<00:03:18.459> you<00:03:19.390> can<00:03:19.450> do<00:03:19.600> focus

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:19.959 
could be your focus you can do focus

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:21.330 
could be your focus you can do focus
pulls<00:03:20.170> this<00:03:20.350> way<00:03:20.560> and<00:03:20.709> these<00:03:20.799> are<00:03:20.920> temporary

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 
pulls this way and these are temporary

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:24.270 
pulls this way and these are temporary
limits<00:03:22.120> so<00:03:23.049> this<00:03:23.080> bar<00:03:23.530> represents<00:03:24.040> the<00:03:24.130> full

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 
limits so this bar represents the full

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:25.650 
limits so this bar represents the full
calibrated<00:03:24.850> range<00:03:25.060> let's<00:03:25.299> say<00:03:25.390> your<00:03:25.510> first

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:25.660 
calibrated range let's say your first

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:26.789 
calibrated range let's say your first
focus<00:03:26.110> was<00:03:26.260> there

00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:26.799 
focus was there

explode button now that ranges this full
range<00:03:35.170> here<00:03:35.440> we<00:03:36.130> have<00:03:36.280> virtual<00:03:36.640> joysticks<00:03:37.420> so

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:38.170 
range here we have virtual joysticks so

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:40.110 
range here we have virtual joysticks so
these<00:03:38.290> are<00:03:38.470> two<00:03:38.590> axis<00:03:38.920> virtual<00:03:39.670> joysticks

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:40.120 
these are two axis virtual joysticks

these are two axis virtual joysticks
pans<00:03:40.360> and<00:03:40.570> tilts<00:03:40.630> and<00:03:41.110> then<00:03:41.709> these<00:03:41.830> two<00:03:42.040> little

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:42.459 
pans and tilts and then these two little

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:43.979 
pans and tilts and then these two little
icons<00:03:42.580> in<00:03:42.940> the<00:03:43.030> corners<00:03:43.360> if<00:03:43.510> you<00:03:43.600> push<00:03:43.810> and

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:43.989 
icons in the corners if you push and

hold<00:03:44.140> that<00:03:44.260> that<00:03:44.799> activates<00:03:45.340> the<00:03:45.489> devices

00:03:46.259 --> 00:03:46.269 
hold that that activates the devices

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:48.539 
hold that that activates the devices
accelerometer<00:03:47.049> so<00:03:47.470> now<00:03:47.620> this<00:03:47.830> can<00:03:48.040> tilt<00:03:48.280> and

00:03:48.539 --> 00:03:48.549 
accelerometer so now this can tilt and

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:52.710 
accelerometer so now this can tilt and
pan<00:03:48.810> just<00:03:49.810> by<00:03:49.930> moving<00:03:50.080> the<00:03:50.320> iPad<00:03:50.709> okay<00:03:51.610> so<00:03:51.720> what

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 
pan just by moving the iPad okay so what

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.710 
pan just by moving the iPad okay so what
is<00:03:52.840> all<00:03:52.959> this<00:03:53.110> crazy<00:03:53.709> gizmos<00:03:54.610> stuff<00:03:55.000> cost<00:03:55.299> and

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:55.720 
is all this crazy gizmos stuff cost and

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:56.610 
is all this crazy gizmos stuff cost and
where<00:03:55.959> can<00:03:56.049> they<00:03:56.170> get<00:03:56.320> it

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:56.620 
where can they get it

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:59.220 
where can they get it
unit<00:03:57.160> drive<00:03:57.390> for<00:03:58.390> the<00:03:58.480> one<00:03:58.600> axis<00:03:58.780> system

basically<00:04:07.209> starts<00:04:07.690> with<00:04:07.840> the<00:04:07.989> brain<00:04:08.320> at<00:04:08.500> about

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:08.680 
basically starts with the brain at about

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:11.550 
basically starts with the brain at about
$1000<00:04:09.430> and<00:04:09.640> then<00:04:09.790> built<00:04:10.239> up<00:04:10.390> to<00:04:10.510> a<00:04:10.570> system<00:04:10.810> this

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:11.560 
$1000 and then built up to a system this

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.930 
$1000 and then built up to a system this
is<00:04:11.739> 5<00:04:11.920> axis<00:04:12.280> about<00:04:12.489> 10,000

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:13.940 
is 5 axis about 10,000

is 5 axis about 10,000
the<00:04:14.030> common<00:04:14.390> system<00:04:14.810> that<00:04:14.930> we<00:04:15.020> sells<00:04:15.200> a<00:04:15.320> 3-axis

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:15.890 
the common system that we sells a 3-axis

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:17.740 
the common system that we sells a 3-axis
system<00:04:16.700> for<00:04:16.820> about<00:04:16.970> six<00:04:17.150> thousand<00:04:17.540> dollars

and<00:04:18.410> the<00:04:18.560> iPad<00:04:18.860> app<00:04:19.040> is<00:04:19.190> included<00:04:19.610> with<00:04:19.730> you

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:24.100 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:27.700 

and<00:04:25.100> what<00:04:25.460> about<00:04:25.610> the<00:04:25.790> remote<00:04:26.660> in<00:04:26.930> the<00:04:26.990> follow

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:27.710 
and what about the remote in the follow

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:31.240 
and what about the remote in the follow
focus<00:04:28.100> I<00:04:28.760> sure<00:04:29.360> the<00:04:29.390> remote<00:04:29.900> is<00:04:30.110> right<00:04:31.040> now
