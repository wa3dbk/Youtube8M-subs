00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
that some of the damage is starting to

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.450 
that some of the damage is starting to
happen<00:01:06.299> with<00:01:06.630> these<00:01:07.260> plants<00:01:07.770> here<00:01:07.979> to<00:01:08.159> start

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
happen with these plants here to start

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.600 
happen with these plants here to start
to<00:01:08.580> turn<00:01:08.790> brown<00:01:08.850> now<00:01:09.390> and<00:01:10.340> some<00:01:11.340> of<00:01:11.460> them<00:01:11.580> are

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
to turn brown now and some of them are

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.390 
to turn brown now and some of them are
even<00:01:11.930> turning<00:01:12.930> a<00:01:13.080> little<00:01:13.200> black<00:01:14.040> in<00:01:14.310> the

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
even turning a little black in the

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.840 
even turning a little black in the
middle<00:01:15.920> just<00:01:16.920> trying<00:01:17.189> to<00:01:17.220> get<00:01:17.400> these<00:01:17.610> things

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
middle just trying to get these things

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.260 
middle just trying to get these things
under<00:01:18.210> control<00:01:19.759> I'll<00:01:20.759> probably<00:01:20.970> end<00:01:21.180> up

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
under control I'll probably end up

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.200 
under control I'll probably end up
having<00:01:21.570> to<00:01:21.630> pull<00:01:21.869> some<00:01:22.170> of<00:01:22.200> this<00:01:22.909> but<00:01:23.909> a<00:01:23.939> lot<00:01:24.150> of

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
having to pull some of this but a lot of

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.539 
having to pull some of this but a lot of
it<00:01:24.420> will<00:01:24.509> just<00:01:24.570> disintegrate<00:01:28.280> show<00:01:29.280> you<00:01:29.340> the

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
it will just disintegrate show you the

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:34.880 
it will just disintegrate show you the
more<00:01:29.759> profound<00:01:30.630> results<00:01:30.869> in<00:01:31.700> the<00:01:32.700> back<00:01:33.829> but<00:01:34.829> I

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
more profound results in the back but I

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.569 
more profound results in the back but I
also<00:01:35.100> used<00:01:35.549> it<00:01:36.320> along<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:37.350> edge<00:01:37.710> of<00:01:37.979> the<00:01:38.100> fence

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
also used it along the edge of the fence

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:42.550 
also used it along the edge of the fence
over<00:01:38.880> here<00:01:39.680> just<00:01:40.680> to<00:01:41.009> kind<00:01:41.579> of<00:01:41.670> get<00:01:41.909> the

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560 
over here just to kind of get the

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.270 
over here just to kind of get the
overgrowth<00:01:43.610> under<00:01:44.610> control<00:01:45.090> and<00:01:46.040> let's<00:01:47.040> get

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
overgrowth under control and let's get

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.469 
overgrowth under control and let's get
through<00:01:47.549> this<00:01:47.579> fence<00:01:47.970> here<00:01:50.030> and<00:01:51.030> you<00:01:51.119> can<00:01:51.240> see

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479

this<00:02:11.140> crack<00:02:11.500> over<00:02:11.860> here<00:02:12.040> really<00:02:12.400> bad<00:02:12.610> but

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
this crack over here really bad but

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.240 
this crack over here really bad but
these<00:02:13.630> are<00:02:13.870> this<00:02:14.110> is<00:02:14.170> just<00:02:14.500> one<00:02:14.740> day<00:02:14.920> and<00:02:15.190> this

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
these are this is just one day and this

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.110 
these are this is just one day and this
is<00:02:15.460> still<00:02:15.640> pretty<00:02:16.210> early<00:02:16.390> in<00:02:16.690> the<00:02:16.840> morning<00:02:17.170> and

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
is still pretty early in the morning and

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.390 
is still pretty early in the morning and
they're<00:02:19.120> just<00:02:19.330> turning<00:02:19.690> black<00:02:20.160> just<00:02:21.160> getting

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
they're just turning black just getting

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:26.400 
they're just turning black just getting
obliterated<00:02:23.220> anyway<00:02:24.220> I<00:02:25.030> think<00:02:25.960> this<00:02:26.260> is

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
obliterated anyway I think this is

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:29.240 
obliterated anyway I think this is
really<00:02:26.620> promising<00:02:27.250> especially<00:02:27.790> since<00:02:28.060> that

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
really promising especially since that

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.280 
really promising especially since that
that<00:02:30.250> whole<00:02:30.460> thing<00:02:30.760> of<00:02:31.000> worryfree<00:02:31.360> was

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
that whole thing of worryfree was

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:35.010 
that whole thing of worryfree was
sitting<00:02:32.620> out<00:02:32.709> on<00:02:32.740> my<00:02:32.920> front<00:02:33.130> porch<00:02:33.510> over<00:02:34.510> the

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:35.020 
sitting out on my front porch over the

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:37.830 
sitting out on my front porch over the
