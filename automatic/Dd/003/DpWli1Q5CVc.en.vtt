00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:30.650 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:33.729 

I<00:00:31.090> grew<00:00:32.090> up<00:00:32.180> in<00:00:32.390> this<00:00:32.570> pretty<00:00:33.140> little<00:00:33.350> place

00:00:33.729 --> 00:00:33.739 
I grew up in this pretty little place

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:37.510 
I grew up in this pretty little place
called<00:00:34.130> the<00:00:34.430> broken<00:00:35.000> head<00:00:35.180> reserve<00:00:35.600> and<00:00:36.520> my

called the broken head reserve and my

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:39.130 
called the broken head reserve and my
earliest<00:00:37.850> memory<00:00:38.239> of<00:00:38.390> any<00:00:38.540> attention<00:00:38.870> being

earliest memory of any attention being
brought<00:00:39.410> to<00:00:39.590> my<00:00:39.739> race<00:00:39.950> was<00:00:40.220> when<00:00:40.400> I<00:00:40.430> was<00:00:40.670> about

00:00:40.869 --> 00:00:40.879 
brought to my race was when I was about

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:52.600 
brought to my race was when I was about
seven<00:00:48.460> there<00:00:49.460> was<00:00:49.610> a<00:00:49.640> teacher<00:00:51.400> who<00:00:52.400> said

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:52.610 
seven there was a teacher who said

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:54.490 
seven there was a teacher who said
something<00:00:52.820> to<00:00:52.940> me<00:00:53.059> that<00:00:53.089> pretty<00:00:53.570> much<00:00:53.780> scarred

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:54.500 
something to me that pretty much scarred

00:00:54.500 --> 00:01:11.370 
something to me that pretty much scarred
me<00:00:54.800> for<00:00:55.160> years<00:00:55.280> to<00:00:55.400> come<00:00:55.760> she<00:00:56.420> said<00:01:09.610> there<00:01:10.610> was

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:11.380 
me for years to come she said there was

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:13.870 
me for years to come she said there was
only<00:01:12.380> then<00:01:12.830> it<00:01:13.070> occurred<00:01:13.340> to<00:01:13.369> me<00:01:13.460> that<00:01:13.549> there

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:13.880 
only then it occurred to me that there

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.539 
only then it occurred to me that there
were<00:01:14.119> differences<00:01:14.630> with<00:01:15.170> people<00:01:15.619> and<00:01:16.250> then<00:01:16.460> I

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:16.549 
were differences with people and then I

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:17.980 
were differences with people and then I
thought<00:01:16.760> more<00:01:16.939> of<00:01:17.030> eating<00:01:17.390> that<00:01:17.540> Apple<00:01:17.689> than

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:17.990 
thought more of eating that Apple than

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:21.010 
thought more of eating that Apple than
what<00:01:18.140> she<00:01:18.320> meant<00:01:18.439> by<00:01:18.680> it<00:01:18.740> at<00:01:18.950> the<00:01:19.070> time<00:01:19.990> so<00:01:20.990> I

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:21.020 
what she meant by it at the time so I

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.260 
what she meant by it at the time so I
ran<00:01:21.710> out<00:01:21.890> with<00:01:22.040> my<00:01:22.220> new<00:01:22.460> knowledge<00:01:22.880> and<00:01:23.030> half

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:23.270 
ran out with my new knowledge and half

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:25.330 
ran out with my new knowledge and half
we<00:01:23.450> told<00:01:23.780> at<00:01:23.960> least<00:01:23.990> ten<00:01:24.530> other<00:01:24.860> Little

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:25.340
