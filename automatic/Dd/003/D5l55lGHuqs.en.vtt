a review on the Black Widow ultimate

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.069 
a review on the Black Widow ultimate
which<00:00:46.230> does<00:00:46.620> have<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:47.329> blue<00:00:48.329> cherry<00:00:48.960> MX

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
which does have the blue cherry MX

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.189 
which does have the blue cherry MX
switches<00:00:49.379> and<00:00:50.270> after<00:00:51.270> trying<00:00:51.539> that<00:00:51.750> out<00:00:51.809> I

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
switches and after trying that out I

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.920 
switches and after trying that out I
really<00:00:52.800> have<00:00:52.949> to<00:00:53.070> say<00:00:53.250> that<00:00:53.489> I'm<00:00:53.940> glad<00:00:54.660> I<00:00:54.690> got

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
really have to say that I'm glad I got

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.590 
really have to say that I'm glad I got
the<00:00:55.079> Browns<00:00:55.350> I<00:00:55.969> think<00:00:56.969> they're<00:00:57.120> much<00:00:57.390> more

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
the Browns I think they're much more

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.099 
the Browns I think they're much more
comfortable<00:00:58.109> to<00:00:58.260> type<00:00:58.500> on<00:00:58.969> there<00:00:59.969> and<00:01:00.660> they<00:01:00.870> I

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
comfortable to type on there and they I

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.930 
comfortable to type on there and they I
think<00:01:01.410> they<00:01:01.530> sound<00:01:01.800> better<00:01:02.129> you<00:01:02.670> know<00:01:02.760> that's

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
think they sound better you know that's

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.719 
think they sound better you know that's
just<00:01:03.000> a<00:01:03.180> personal<00:01:03.660> preference<00:01:03.989> and<00:01:04.729> they're

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
just a personal preference and they're

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.950 
just a personal preference and they're
just<00:01:05.880> more<00:01:06.000> comfortable<00:01:07.430> on<00:01:08.430> my<00:01:08.700> own<00:01:09.240> context

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
just more comfortable on my own context

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.850 
just more comfortable on my own context
shift<00:01:10.200> I<00:01:10.380> did<00:01:11.189> a<00:01:11.220> short<00:01:11.640> article<00:01:11.970> about

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:12.860 
shift I did a short article about

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:17.060 
shift I did a short article about
modding<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:14.100> key<00:01:14.400> switches<00:01:14.729> so<00:01:15.979> modding<00:01:16.979> the

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
modding the key switches so modding the

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.580 
modding the key switches so modding the
key<00:01:17.220> switches<00:01:17.490> with<00:01:17.759> o-rings<00:01:18.240> so<00:01:18.720> it<00:01:19.290> would<00:01:19.439> be

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
key switches with o-rings so it would be

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:25.219 
key switches with o-rings so it would be
quieter<00:01:20.479> I<00:01:21.650> think<00:01:22.650> with<00:01:22.770> me<00:01:22.950> is<00:01:23.360> I'm<00:01:24.360> kind<00:01:24.990> of<00:01:25.140> a

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
quieter I think with me is I'm kind of a

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.410 
quieter I think with me is I'm kind of a
night<00:01:25.439> owl<00:01:25.470> so<00:01:26.009> I<00:01:26.250> do<00:01:26.400> a<00:01:26.549> lot<00:01:26.759> of<00:01:26.790> my<00:01:26.970> typing<00:01:27.210> at

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
night owl so I do a lot of my typing at

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.340 
night owl so I do a lot of my typing at
night<00:01:27.799> my<00:01:28.799> girlfriend<00:01:29.430> hates<00:01:30.210> it<00:01:30.780> when<00:01:30.810> I<00:01:31.020> type

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
night my girlfriend hates it when I type

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:31.940 
night my girlfriend hates it when I type
at<00:01:31.530> night

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
at night

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.710 
at night
so<00:01:32.700> doing<00:01:33.420> the<00:01:33.720> whole<00:01:34.530> ring<00:01:34.770> mod<00:01:35.119> helps<00:01:36.119> a<00:01:36.479> bit

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
so doing the whole ring mod helps a bit

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.940 
so doing the whole ring mod helps a bit
but<00:01:37.680> if<00:01:37.920> I<00:01:38.100> had<00:01:38.310> the<00:01:38.520> cherry<00:01:39.299> MX<00:01:39.420> blue<00:01:39.659> switches

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 
but if I had the cherry MX blue switches

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.429 
but if I had the cherry MX blue switches
she<00:01:40.950> would<00:01:41.070> go<00:01:41.220> crazy<00:01:41.899> I'm<00:01:42.899> just<00:01:43.170> gonna<00:01:43.259> give

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
she would go crazy I'm just gonna give

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:44.630 
she would go crazy I'm just gonna give
you<00:01:43.470> a<00:01:43.560> quick<00:01:43.770> demonstration<00:01:43.950> of<00:01:44.399> the

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640

old<00:02:36.030> ring<00:02:36.239> mod<00:02:36.420> and<00:02:36.720> one<00:02:37.319> of<00:02:37.410> the<00:02:37.470> reasons<00:02:37.830> for

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
old ring mod and one of the reasons for

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.070 
old ring mod and one of the reasons for
that<00:02:38.099> is<00:02:38.310> I<00:02:38.340> didn't<00:02:39.000> have<00:02:39.120> enough<00:02:39.330> roll<00:02:39.510> rings

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
that is I didn't have enough roll rings

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:44.960 
that is I didn't have enough roll rings
and<00:02:41.930> you<00:02:42.930> know<00:02:43.050> I<00:02:43.080> just<00:02:43.290> did<00:02:43.470> a<00:02:43.500> home<00:02:43.709> rose<00:02:43.980> and

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
and you know I just did a home rose and

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.720 
and you know I just did a home rose and
a<00:02:45.060> few<00:02:45.269> of<00:02:45.360> these<00:02:45.450> keys<00:02:46.130> that<00:02:47.130> I<00:02:47.190> use<00:02:47.489> all<00:02:47.700> the

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
a few of these keys that I use all the

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:52.280 
a few of these keys that I use all the
time<00:02:47.880> but<00:02:50.060> I'm<00:02:51.060> thinking<00:02:51.360> about<00:02:51.390> getting<00:02:52.049> some

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
time but I'm thinking about getting some

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.050 
time but I'm thinking about getting some
more<00:02:52.319> old<00:02:52.560> rings<00:02:52.769> to<00:02:52.950> just<00:02:53.160> fill<00:02:53.400> up<00:02:53.519> the<00:02:53.730> rest

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
more old rings to just fill up the rest

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.930 
more old rings to just fill up the rest
of<00:02:54.180> the<00:02:54.269> keys<00:02:54.870> they<00:02:55.620> can<00:02:55.769> get<00:02:55.950> a<00:02:55.980> pretty<00:02:56.700> loud

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:58.759 
of the keys they can get a pretty loud

at night it doesn't sound like much of a

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:00.530 
at night it doesn't sound like much of a
difference<00:02:59.099> but<00:02:59.310> when<00:02:59.910> you're<00:03:00.060> typing<00:03:00.269> on<00:03:00.450> at

about 6065 words a minute right now

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:15.860 
about 6065 words a minute right now
which<00:04:13.380> isn't<00:04:13.650> fast<00:04:13.889> but<00:04:14.280> you<00:04:14.609> know<00:04:14.730> I've<00:04:15.480> never

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:15.870 
which isn't fast but you know I've never

been able to type more than 25 a few

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:21.949 
been able to type more than 25 a few
months<00:04:18.989> ago<00:04:19.079> so<00:04:19.889> I<00:04:19.919> think<00:04:20.010> that's<00:04:20.459> the<00:04:20.959> big

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:21.959 
months ago so I think that's the big

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:26.750 
months ago so I think that's the big
deal<00:04:22.169> and<00:04:23.419> it's<00:04:24.419> way<00:04:25.229> more<00:04:25.260> enjoyable<00:04:26.010> on<00:04:26.400> this

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:26.760 
deal and it's way more enjoyable on this

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:29.510 
deal and it's way more enjoyable on this
or<00:04:26.970> then<00:04:27.180> let's<00:04:27.900> say<00:04:28.230> let's<00:04:29.070> say<00:04:29.130> this<00:04:29.370> key

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520 
or then let's say let's say this key

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:35.360 
or then let's say let's say this key
with<00:04:29.670> my<00:04:29.820> my<00:04:30.630> laptop<00:04:31.170> keyboard<00:04:32.870> which<00:04:34.370> sucks

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:35.370 
with my my laptop keyboard which sucks

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:39.110 
with my my laptop keyboard which sucks

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:20.580 
hands like an angle I can't really do my

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:21.680 
hands like an angle I can't really do my
own<00:06:20.640> hand<00:06:20.880> cuz<00:06:21.000> I'm<00:06:21.090> holding<00:06:21.390> this<00:06:21.450> camera

you're typing like this but after typing
on<00:06:30.240> that<00:06:30.450> keyboard<00:06:30.720> for<00:06:31.080> about<00:06:31.350> a<00:06:31.380> year<00:06:31.710> and

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:31.860 
on that keyboard for about a year and

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:34.220 
on that keyboard for about a year and
typing<00:06:32.610> on<00:06:32.760> this<00:06:32.880> keyboard<00:06:32.940> for<00:06:33.630> a<00:06:33.690> few<00:06:33.900> months

typing on this keyboard for a few months

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:37.400 
typing on this keyboard for a few months
I<00:06:34.380> can<00:06:35.130> I<00:06:35.370> can<00:06:35.610> probably<00:06:35.760> say<00:06:36.060> that<00:06:36.450> the

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:37.410 
I can I can probably say that the

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:38.720 
I can I can probably say that the
the<00:06:37.860> most<00:06:38.160> important<00:06:38.580> thing<00:06:38.700> about

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:38.730 
the most important thing about

00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:41.120 
the most important thing about
ergonomics<00:06:39.060> in<00:06:39.930> typing<00:06:40.530> I<00:06:40.650> believe<00:06:40.920> is<00:06:41.040> the

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:41.130 
ergonomics in typing I believe is the

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:43.190 
ergonomics in typing I believe is the
key<00:06:41.340> switches<00:06:41.640> because<00:06:42.450> when<00:06:42.810> I'm<00:06:42.930> talking

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:43.200 
key switches because when I'm talking

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:45.710 
key switches because when I'm talking
for<00:06:43.320> a<00:06:43.380> long<00:06:43.530> period<00:06:43.980> of<00:06:44.040> periods<00:06:44.640> of<00:06:44.760> time<00:06:44.970> my

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:45.720 
for a long period of periods of time my

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:47.920 
for a long period of periods of time my
fingers<00:06:46.140> don't<00:06:46.290> get<00:06:46.440> tired<00:06:46.680> anymore<00:06:47.010> it's

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:47.930
