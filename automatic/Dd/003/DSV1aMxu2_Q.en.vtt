00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:20.439
 what little is known about it is really 

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:20.439
 scary 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:28.920
 it was created in 1827 in a coal mine 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:32.910
 this had an approximate speed of 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.560
 160 kilometers per hour at its very point 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.050
 strong 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:40.440
 The scary thing about this is that I did not have 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:45.350
 no type of insurance or retention and the 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.350
 trip lasted about 30 minutes 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:50.880
 in 1937 it was dismantled 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:01:01.460
 in position number 4 we have the thunder 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:05.869
 golf and is in Tokyo starts with 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:08.440
 vertiginous lunge of 218 feet up 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:10.660
 an angle of 80 degrees 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:12.940
 this roller coaster is known for its 

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:14.430
 Unique design that goes around 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:17.940
 buildings 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:22.130
 and reaches a maximum speed of 130 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:22.130
 kilometers per hour 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:41.100
 now 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.100
 goodbye 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:10.300
 already the list is going down what they are going 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.980
 to see from here are enough 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:14.349
 terrifying 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:16.630
 in position number 3 we have the 

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:18.790
 millenium work 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:22.350
 this was the first roller coaster in 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:24.770
 exceed 300 feet in height in the year 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:28.280
 2000 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:32.820
 his fall of 300 feet can be quite 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:35.530
 bad for what they take from the passengers 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:40.630
 it is currently the steel roller coaster 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:46.150
 longest in the USA with six thousand 595 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:48.130
 feet and reaches about 150 kilometers 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:51.040
 hour 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:55.780
 the journey takes about two minutes and is 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:57.000
 capable of carrying up to 1,600 passengers 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:01.070
 hours 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.070
 Here is the video 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:46.250
 it is known as the first strata 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:49.130
 quarter the top three ldrac story tells 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:51.860
 with more than 400 feet in height and one 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:53.110
 speed of about 190 kilometers 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:56.550
 hour 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:04:00.070
 when he debuted for the first time in 2003 

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:03.640
 set three records which was the 

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:06.100
 higher the steepest fall and the 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:08.730
 Faster 

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:12.470
 they all break later 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:12.470
 one more 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:55.310
 here we come to the end of the top with the 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:58.490
 number 1 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:05:01.560
 the mother of roller coasters the most 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:05.790
 high and the most 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:08.310
 is the fifth house located in new 

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:10.740
 jersey has a design similar to the 

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:15.470
 previous but the speed and height 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:15.470
 that reaches this makes it different 

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:22.280
 manages to reach 206 kilometers per hour 

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:27.770
 in 35 seconds and at the end of the tower 

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:32.180
 main reaches a height of 456 feet 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:34.910
 this roller coaster opened in 2005 and by 

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:38.030
 technical problems had to close 

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:41.599
 several times a curiosity is that to 

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:44.470
 early May in 2009 was hit 

00:05:41.599 --> 00:05:44.470
 by lightning 

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:50.490
 bayern 

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:27.190
 and well this was all the top today 

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:30.970
 I hope you liked it like a 

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:34.290
 comment is appreciated and see you in the 

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:34.290
