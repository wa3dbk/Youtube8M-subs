with the frame of the door I've made a

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.289 
with the frame of the door I've made a
series<00:03:39.629> of<00:03:39.799> cuts<00:03:40.799> here<00:03:41.129> approximately<00:03:41.639> the

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:42.299

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:46.909 
depth of the middle of the strike flange
and<00:03:45.060> I'll<00:03:45.419> be<00:03:45.689> taking<00:03:46.109> the<00:03:46.199> rest<00:03:46.439> out<00:03:46.650> with<00:03:46.889> a

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:46.919 
and I'll be taking the rest out with a

00:03:46.919 --> 00:03:57.140 
and I'll be taking the rest out with a
chisel<00:03:55.310> so<00:03:56.310> now<00:03:56.459> we're<00:03:56.639> going<00:03:56.729> to<00:03:56.849> see<00:03:57.030> how

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
chisel so now we're going to see how

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:12.940 
chisel so now we're going to see how
that<00:03:57.180> looks<00:04:03.229> it's<00:04:04.229> a<00:04:04.379> little<00:04:04.799> bit<00:04:04.919> more<00:04:05.099> room

got<00:05:23.039> lots<00:05:23.250> of<00:05:23.430> wire<00:05:23.669> and<00:05:24.210> now<00:05:24.330> we're<00:05:24.479> just

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:24.630 
got lots of wire and now we're just

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:28.610 
got lots of wire and now we're just
going<00:05:24.840> to<00:05:24.930> tuck<00:05:25.139> this<00:05:25.380> wire<00:05:27.590> into<00:05:28.590> the

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:28.620 
going to tuck this wire into the

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:33.050 
going to tuck this wire into the
doorframe<00:05:30.620> now<00:05:31.620> I'm<00:05:31.770> going<00:05:32.039> to<00:05:32.130> pre-drill<00:05:32.639> the

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:33.060 
doorframe now I'm going to pre-drill the

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:41.129 
doorframe now I'm going to pre-drill the
holes<00:05:33.300> to<00:05:34.130> screw<00:05:35.130> in<00:05:35.280> the<00:05:35.400> screws

00:05:41.129 --> 00:05:41.139 

00:05:41.139 --> 00:05:43.360 

this<00:05:42.139> is<00:05:42.320> a<00:05:42.350> lot<00:05:42.500> of<00:05:42.650> work<00:05:42.800> I<00:05:42.950> think<00:05:43.010> I'm<00:05:43.250> going

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:43.370 
this is a lot of work I think I'm going

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:44.770 
this is a lot of work I think I'm going
to<00:05:43.430> use<00:05:43.550> the<00:05:43.669> power<00:05:43.820> drill<00:05:44.150> for<00:05:44.389> the<00:05:44.480> rest<00:05:44.630> of

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:44.780 
to use the power drill for the rest of

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:56.260 
to use the power drill for the rest of
this<00:05:51.310> this<00:05:52.310> is<00:05:52.520> a<00:05:52.550> metal<00:05:52.910> door<00:05:53.810> frame<00:05:54.169> and<00:05:55.270> we

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:56.270 
this this is a metal door frame and we

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:59.040 
this this is a metal door frame and we
wanted<00:05:56.570> to<00:05:56.660> fill<00:05:56.960> in<00:05:57.200> a<00:05:57.440> little<00:05:57.860> bit<00:05:58.010> of<00:05:58.190> the

00:05:59.040 --> 00:05:59.050 
wanted to fill in a little bit of the

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:01.180 
wanted to fill in a little bit of the
cutout<00:06:00.050> of<00:06:00.080> the<00:06:00.230> metal<00:06:00.590> so<00:06:00.800> we<00:06:00.830> had<00:06:01.040> a<00:06:01.070> little

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:01.190 
cutout of the metal so we had a little

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:05.650 
cutout of the metal so we had a little
metal<00:06:01.550> shim<00:06:01.880> in<00:06:02.060> there<00:06:02.240> and<00:06:02.710> we<00:06:03.710> just<00:06:04.660> painted

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:05.660 
metal shim in there and we just painted

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:08.710 
metal shim in there and we just painted
it<00:06:05.750> up<00:06:05.930> to<00:06:06.139> make<00:06:06.320> it<00:06:06.440> match<00:06:06.919> part<00:06:07.400> of<00:06:07.490> the<00:06:07.720> body

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:08.720 
it up to make it match part of the body

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:11.560
