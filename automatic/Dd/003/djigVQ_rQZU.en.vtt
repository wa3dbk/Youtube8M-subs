sugar you're eating what you eat and and

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.310 
sugar you're eating what you eat and and
what<00:00:45.030> your<00:00:45.149> hormones<00:00:45.450> look<00:00:45.600> like<00:00:45.780> can<00:00:46.050> have<00:00:46.230> an

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
what your hormones look like can have an

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.540 
what your hormones look like can have an
effect<00:00:46.620> on<00:00:46.710> the<00:00:46.829> way<00:00:46.950> you're<00:00:47.129> storing<00:00:47.399> your

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
effect on the way you're storing your

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.600 
effect on the way you're storing your
body<00:00:47.730> fat<00:00:48.000> so<00:00:48.360> if<00:00:49.289> it's<00:00:49.770> the<00:00:50.070> you're<00:00:50.370> stuck<00:00:50.520> at

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
body fat so if it's the you're stuck at

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:51.920 
body fat so if it's the you're stuck at
the<00:00:50.670> fort<00:00:50.879> back<00:00:50.969> and<00:00:51.210> can't<00:00:51.390> get<00:00:51.480> a<00:00:51.539> six-pack

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
the fort back and can't get a six-pack

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.229 
the fort back and can't get a six-pack
maybe<00:00:52.590> look<00:00:52.770> at<00:00:52.890> your<00:00:53.010> sugar<00:00:53.219> intake<00:00:53.399> versus

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
maybe look at your sugar intake versus

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.240 
maybe look at your sugar intake versus
and<00:00:55.020> your<00:00:55.140> sleep<00:00:55.410> and<00:00:55.559> recovery<00:00:55.949> and<00:00:56.070> stuff

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
and your sleep and recovery and stuff

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.330 
and your sleep and recovery and stuff
like<00:00:56.370> that<00:00:57.140> but<00:00:58.140> what<00:00:58.680> I<00:00:58.739> would<00:00:58.949> do<00:00:59.039> first<00:00:59.190> is

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
like that but what I would do first is

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.160 
like that but what I would do first is
make<00:00:59.520> sure<00:00:59.550> that<00:01:00.059> you're<00:01:00.449> using<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:00.989> right

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
tools and measure yourself using

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:03.979 
tools and measure yourself using
calipers<00:01:02.609> make<00:01:03.059> sure<00:01:03.180> they're<00:01:03.329> calibrated

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
calipers make sure they're calibrated

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.770 
calipers make sure they're calibrated
and<00:01:04.250> you<00:01:05.250> know<00:01:05.369> the<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:06.060> best<00:01:06.210> thing<00:01:06.360> to<00:01:06.479> go

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
and you know the the best thing to go

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.330 
and you know the the best thing to go
get<00:01:07.020> if<00:01:07.229> you<00:01:07.380> want<00:01:07.590> to<00:01:07.680> really<00:01:08.010> know<00:01:08.159> what<00:01:08.189> your

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
get if you want to really know what your

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.130 
get if you want to really know what your
body<00:01:08.520> fat<00:01:08.729> is<00:01:08.760> is<00:01:09.090> a<00:01:09.240> DEXA<00:01:09.659> scan<00:01:09.930> as

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
body fat is is a DEXA scan as

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.910 
body fat is is a DEXA scan as
dual-energy<00:01:10.799> x-ray

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:12.920 
dual-energy x-ray

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.609 
dual-energy x-ray
forget<00:01:13.920> so<00:01:14.760> it's<00:01:15.540> something<00:01:15.720> like<00:01:15.840> that<00:01:16.140> you

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
forget so it's something like that you

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.800 
forget so it's something like that you
can<00:01:16.770> go<00:01:16.920> there's<00:01:17.700> probably<00:01:18.000> a<00:01:18.090> doctor<00:01:18.570> in<00:01:18.689> your

between 150 and 300 dollars for that

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.969 
between 150 and 300 dollars for that
test<00:01:23.520> I've<00:01:24.479> had<00:01:24.720> it<00:01:24.840> done<00:01:24.990> and<00:01:25.259> it's<00:01:25.770> a

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
test I've had it done and it's a

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.920 
test I've had it done and it's a
extremely<00:01:26.460> insightful<00:01:27.030> so<00:01:27.540> check<00:01:27.750> that<00:01:27.780> out
