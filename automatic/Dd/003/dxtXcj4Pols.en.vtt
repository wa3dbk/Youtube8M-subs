Technical description _rtH8 1/4:
Although in fact the flow which propels this automatism originates in an external power source, the current circle remains open until a rotating piece, hooked onto the engine through a gear assembly, pushes the button that closes the circuit providing energy for an instant during which it gathers power in order to cause the piece to turn once more and push the button that closes the circuit providing energy for an instant during which it gathers power in order to cause the piece to turn once more and push the button that closes the circuit providing energy for an instant during which it gathers power in order to cause the piece to turn once more and push the button that closes the circuit providing energy for an instant during which it gathers power in order to cause the piece to turn once more and push the button that closes the circuit providing energy for an instant during which it gathers power in order to cause the piece to turn once more and push the button ...
Each time the moving piece drives down the button which infuses the engine with energy, a small red led light connected in parallel sees the current flowing through it reduced and its brightness decreases.

Contextual description _rtH8 2/4:
As part of the process of degradation of contemporary art and its endeavor to move away from beautiful forms, during the first half of the 20th century an interplay with the idea of progress took place and as a result, there was an approach to industrial and scientific advances, in an attempt to reflect the era to which the works belonged.
This piece made out of spare parts of a radio-cassette player not only falls within this current, but also, due to its absolute lack of meaning and narrative function, it can already be said nowadays to represent the death rattle of the analog era in pro of a new fully digital one.

00:02:09.694 --> 00:02:33.694
Socio-biological description _rtH8 3/4:
We can clearly discern a metaphor about the role of the artist and how he perceives himself before society and is perceived in turn by i      t, since at the same time that this automaton must necessarily be connected to a power source, it also establishes a process of autonomous feedback that represents his inability to make himself understood by his fellow men due to his starting out from certain assumptions that they fail to comprehend.

00:02:36.189 --> 00:02:39.559
Psychoanalytic description _rtH8 4/4:
(disregarding a more poetic one)

00:02:39.526 --> 00:02:43.062
THIS ROBOT IS MASTURBATING!

00:02:55.141 --> 00:02:58.311
