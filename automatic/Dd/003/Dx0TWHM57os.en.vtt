00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
if I build a machine I know what's best

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.810 
if I build a machine I know what's best
for<00:00:55.379> that<00:00:55.559> machine<00:00:55.949> like<00:00:56.129> I<00:00:56.250> know<00:00:56.309> what<00:00:56.520> parts

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
for that machine like I know what parts

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.910 
for that machine like I know what parts
need<00:00:56.879> to<00:00:57.090> go<00:00:57.239> in<00:00:57.360> it<00:00:57.539> and<00:00:57.719> I<00:00:57.840> know<00:00:57.899> like<00:00:58.199> what

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
need to go in it and I know like what

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.799 
need to go in it and I know like what
kind<00:00:58.949> of<00:00:59.190> parts<00:00:59.520> that<00:00:59.579> if<00:00:59.940> if<00:01:00.300> they<00:01:00.510> were<00:01:00.570> put

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
kind of parts that if if they were put

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.380 
kind of parts that if if they were put
into<00:01:00.989> it<00:01:01.289> it<00:01:01.410> would<00:01:01.530> make<00:01:01.710> it<00:01:01.829> break<00:01:02.039> down<00:01:02.390> so

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
into it it would make it break down so

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.020 
into it it would make it break down so
like<00:01:03.570> God<00:01:03.809> who<00:01:04.019> has<00:01:04.140> created<00:01:04.199> the<00:01:04.530> universe<00:01:05.030> he

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
like God who has created the universe he

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.969 
like God who has created the universe he
knows<00:01:06.270> what's<00:01:06.510> best<00:01:06.810> for<00:01:06.960> each<00:01:07.320> individual

knows what's best for each individual

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.820 
knows what's best for each individual
person<00:01:08.250> and<00:01:08.729> so<00:01:09.390> he<00:01:09.540> tells<00:01:09.810> them<00:01:10.110> good<00:01:10.530> things

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
person and so he tells them good things

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.490 
person and so he tells them good things
that<00:01:11.070> they<00:01:11.400> should<00:01:11.580> follow<00:01:11.790> and<00:01:12.240> evil<00:01:13.200> things

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
that they should follow and evil things

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.940

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:15.950 
they should avoid okay and so

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.170 
they should avoid okay and so

adopt for various reasons whether they

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.780 
adopt for various reasons whether they
were<00:01:21.299> raised<00:01:21.780> by<00:01:22.020> an<00:01:22.140> abusive<00:01:22.350> father<00:01:22.790> whether
