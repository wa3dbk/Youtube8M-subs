tip<00:00:36.530> another<00:00:37.530> thing<00:00:37.920> we<00:00:38.160> liked<00:00:38.399> about<00:00:38.550> the

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
tip another thing we liked about the

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.910 
tip another thing we liked about the
gauge<00:00:39.059> is<00:00:39.270> a<00:00:39.300> fact<00:00:39.629> that<00:00:39.930> we<00:00:40.350> could<00:00:40.530> look<00:00:40.770> at

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
gauge is a fact that we could look at

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.240 
gauge is a fact that we could look at
our<00:00:41.660> voltage<00:00:42.660> from<00:00:43.020> the<00:00:43.170> battery<00:00:43.559> when

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
our voltage from the battery when

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:45.950 
our voltage from the battery when
running<00:00:44.550> auxilary<00:00:45.030> equipment<00:00:45.570> such<00:00:45.780> as<00:00:45.809> a

winch or other auxiliary lighting this
gauge<00:00:51.030> it<00:00:51.500> basically<00:00:52.500> replaces<00:00:53.219> the<00:00:53.399> stock

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
gauge it basically replaces the stock

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.500 
gauge it basically replaces the stock
OEM<00:00:54.629> gauge<00:00:55.230> and<00:00:55.590> uses<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:56.640> same<00:00:56.850> connectors

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
OEM gauge and uses the same connectors

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.830 
OEM gauge and uses the same connectors
that<00:00:58.129> the<00:00:59.129> OEM<00:00:59.430> gauge<00:00:59.699> uses<00:01:00.180> with<00:01:00.809> the

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
that the OEM gauge uses with the

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.840 
that the OEM gauge uses with the
addition<00:01:01.289> of<00:01:01.410> the<00:01:01.649> central<00:01:02.579> package<00:01:02.940> plug
