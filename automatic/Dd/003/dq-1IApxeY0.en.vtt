00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:08.279
 Today is Momo- kun's composition class day welcome 

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:08.279
 I care of the house today 

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:19.810
 This song 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:22.289
 It 's a rusty piano for the current track but I 've made it so far 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:22.289
 song 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:47.140
 I 'm going to say boo then I will go 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:48.160
 I thought that it was not a form but I wanted to put on a piano- like decoration like Janchan 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:51.460
 You 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:58.059
 I will explain my head as it is 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:01:00.510
 I thought I wanted to put on a decoration, so I thought the lyrics of this song 's rust 

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:00.510
 Zoo 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:04.370
 Abei 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:06.550
 Horticulture 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:08.270
 Yeah yeah 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:11.970
 sore 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:17.960
 Hmmm 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:17.960
 Neeun translation in Japanese 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:26.690
 Translated to Myanmar 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.690
 It is ringing the sound of gongs by ringing the bell 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:35.980
 To let you know that there is another way 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:38.990
 Is ringing the sound of meaning that you are is good or gongs Tteyuu 

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:45.390
 To let you know that there is another way 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:54.409
 It's the sound of bells is ringing the sound of the bell I thought I'll be represented by a piano 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:54.409
 And the answer that I selected as a result of trying to express is the woman batting 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.930
 me 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.450
 me 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:03.490
 ni 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:05.330
 me 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.860
 me 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:09.430
 me 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.430
 none 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:18.310
 It is 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:23.380
 I thought of a backing that feels like 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:27.390
 Because color is not good from color 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:31.860
 It looks like a nice color from color 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:32.660
 I did backing like the bell sound was expressed 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:37.700
 so 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:41.110
 First this backing is also considered in the basic melody 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:42.370
 Is that think in saying If you turn on and what it 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:47.080
 Well 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:49.150
 First of all, I think it's from this kind of movement 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:51.180
 me 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:53.110
 ni 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:55.140
 me 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:57.410
 ni 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:58.460
 ni 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:07.580
 1 I 

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:07.580
 I wanted to make this sound most audible to me 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:15.720
 So 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:22.260
 Because I wanted to give a more voluminous feeling on that 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:22.260
 I put 1 between these two sounds 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:27.270
 I wind Tteyuu 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:29.440
 As a result, the altitude is 

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:30.730
 No, and 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:34.090
 a not 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:36.280
 It has become emi Naa nice a minor 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:38.420
 It will be a move 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:40.569
 What would happen to you 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:42.720
 tar 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:43.800
 me 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.790
 ni 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:46.830
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:48.299
 me 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:51.180
 It becomes like this 

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:54.240
 To give a more voluminous feel 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:55.430
 You Yes been thinking, it is left 

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:56.510

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:57.600
 me 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:58.550

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.000

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:00.920
 The wind Tteyuu 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.520
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:05.650
 I got a batting that this was fine for this song 

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:10.329
 Huh 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:13.659
 It is a flow, so I'll pull in this time 

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:19.120
 I will skip the screen of hey 

00:04:13.659 --> 00:04:24.039
 Listen to the last version of the piano and put it to the end 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:25.639
 Composer classroom and after variety which has issued on Sunday that it is renewing as One
