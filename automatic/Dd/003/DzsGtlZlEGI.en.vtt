00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:07.620
 good day bikers can leave 

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:10.930
 as they read it in the title of the video 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:13.540
 it turns out that I was reviewing the internet 

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:16.390
 during this night and I found that 

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:19.720
 in the global page of berries are 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:23.079
 enlisting the pulsar 200 cms as 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:27.039
 available with electronic injection in 

00:00:23.079 --> 00:00:29.069
 turkey which gives me to think that it is 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:31.810
 likely to also arrive in Colombia 

00:00:29.069 --> 00:00:34.660
 Pulsar 200 ms with an injection 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:36.790
 electronic that is in fact one of the 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:39.010
 only reasons why until 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:41.890
 now I have not bought a pulsar 200 in 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:44.540
 that when I tried that of a friend to 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:46.550
 I personally liked it a lot 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:48.980
 I liked how it feels I thought of 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:54.140
 true an evolution in general of 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:56.860
 Cycling performance in appearance is 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:01:00.340
 confirmed is no longer a rumor 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:03.280
 if they check here below in the description 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:05.830
 of the video you will find good links a 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:08.470
 only link that will be the link to the 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:10.240
 global page of berries and there you can see 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:13.060
 which no longer a rumor and is 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:15.729
 something confirmed that in Turkey is 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:18.850
 available pressing 200 ns with 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:20.920
 electronic injection there they have the 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:22.980
 many internet users 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.990
 I wanted to talk to them about 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:28.220
 it is not for you 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:31.420
 when they go on the motorcycle 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:34.700
 they usually talk only because I do 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:36.470
 our I think I'm not the only one I think 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.900
 that we are more who speak alone 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:40.600
 when we are rolling from those who do not 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:42.280
 we make 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:45.729
 then who believe or enter the 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:48.060
 comments of the video the most I wanted them 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:50.399
 propose something 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.110
 tell me what topics you want me to try not 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.979
 it has to be motorcycle any subject 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:59.390
 however controversial religion may be 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:02:01.970
 abortion drugs any kind of subject 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:04.909
 dm topics for those who are interested 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:07.590
 to speak to you in the comments and in 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:10.349
 next videos 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:12.890
 I will make a video for each of your 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.890
 topics that I 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.470
 this is first a test to know if 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:21.680
 the audio is good 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:24.100
 if not, and improving with time and 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.100
 dedication 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.000
 and when he manages to find a balance 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:34.239
 I'll keep that balance for now 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:36.450
 I'm using my cell phone with people from 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:38.370
 pixar 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.850
 and the hands- free microphone in the 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:43.230
 mobile 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:44.940
 they put it in the helmet pads 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.640
 doing tests in offices I've 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:49.290
 I heard very well but now that you 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.629

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.909

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:38.390

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:41.329
 it can be about religion can be about 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:44.819
 abortion can be about marriage 

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:48.000
