when using bootcamp in terms of having
the<00:00:19.930> drivers<00:00:20.290> working<00:00:20.500> I'm<00:00:20.800> you<00:00:21.520> can<00:00:21.669> see<00:00:21.849> that

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:22.270 
the drivers working I'm you can see that

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:24.179 
the drivers working I'm you can see that
I<00:00:22.300> am<00:00:22.509> on<00:00:22.660> a<00:00:22.689> MacBook<00:00:23.140> Pro<00:00:23.169> here<00:00:23.590> and<00:00:23.800> that<00:00:24.040> I<00:00:24.070> do

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:24.189 
I am on a MacBook Pro here and that I do

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:26.580 
I am on a MacBook Pro here and that I do
not<00:00:24.580> have<00:00:24.640> a<00:00:24.910> bug<00:00:25.240> the<00:00:25.390> keyboard<00:00:25.750> and<00:00:25.930> the

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:26.590 
not have a bug the keyboard and the

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:28.049 
not have a bug the keyboard and the
reason<00:00:26.830> for<00:00:26.919> my<00:00:27.039> keyboard<00:00:27.399> not<00:00:27.520> being<00:00:27.730> backlit

00:00:28.049 --> 00:00:28.059 
reason for my keyboard not being backlit

00:00:28.059 --> 00:00:29.639 
reason for my keyboard not being backlit
is<00:00:28.210> the<00:00:28.360> bootcamp<00:00:28.660> drivers<00:00:29.020> haven't<00:00:29.320> started

00:00:29.639 --> 00:00:29.649 
is the bootcamp drivers haven't started

00:00:29.649 --> 00:00:31.740 
is the bootcamp drivers haven't started
and<00:00:29.919> you<00:00:30.579> can<00:00:30.610> see<00:00:30.849> that<00:00:31.029> down<00:00:31.239> here<00:00:31.480> because

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:31.750 
and you can see that down here because

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:36.270 
and you can see that down here because
the<00:00:32.710> bootcamp<00:00:33.370> Dimond<00:00:33.880> isn't<00:00:34.149> there<00:00:34.300> now<00:00:35.280> the

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:36.280 
the bootcamp Dimond isn't there now the

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.459 
the bootcamp Dimond isn't there now the
way<00:00:36.370> to<00:00:36.430> fix<00:00:36.760> this<00:00:37.030> is<00:00:37.270> to<00:00:37.329> just<00:00:37.719> go<00:00:37.930> to<00:00:37.989> your<00:00:38.260> C

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:10.659 
shortcut to the startup folder in your

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:13.740 
shortcut to the startup folder in your
Program<00:01:11.080> Files<00:01:11.640> like<00:01:12.640> in<00:01:12.820> your<00:01:13.000> program<00:01:13.390> on

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:13.750 
Program Files like in your program on

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:16.050 
Program Files like in your program on
the<00:01:14.050> Start<00:01:14.259> menu<00:01:14.310> so<00:01:15.310> if<00:01:15.369> you<00:01:15.490> just<00:01:15.670> drag<00:01:15.880> it

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:16.060 
the Start menu so if you just drag it

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.530 
the Start menu so if you just drag it
onto<00:01:16.240> your<00:01:16.750> Start<00:01:17.110> menu<00:01:17.380> and<00:01:17.670> then<00:01:18.670> onto<00:01:18.940> all

00:01:22.889 --> 00:01:22.899 
programs and then find your startup

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:27.150 
programs and then find your startup
folder<00:01:23.110> which<00:01:23.409> is<00:01:24.270> and<00:01:25.500> then<00:01:26.500> just<00:01:26.679> drop<00:01:26.890> it<00:01:27.039> in

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:27.160 
folder which is and then just drop it in

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:29.730 
folder which is and then just drop it in
there<00:01:27.660> so<00:01:28.660> you<00:01:28.720> can<00:01:28.899> see<00:01:29.020> that<00:01:29.140> it's<00:01:29.259> now<00:01:29.380> in<00:01:29.590> my

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:29.740 
there so you can see that it's now in my

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:31.650 
there so you can see that it's now in my
style<00:01:30.009> folder<00:01:30.429> and<00:01:30.610> what<00:01:31.030> that<00:01:31.210> folder<00:01:31.479> does

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:31.660 
style folder and what that folder does

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:33.510 
style folder and what that folder does
is<00:01:31.869> it<00:01:32.110> will<00:01:32.259> start<00:01:32.380> everything<00:01:33.190> that<00:01:33.369> has<00:01:33.490> a

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:33.520 
is it will start everything that has a

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.249 
is it will start everything that has a
shortcut<00:01:33.910> in<00:01:34.119> that<00:01:34.270> folder<00:01:34.479> when<00:01:35.050> your

00:01:35.249 --> 00:01:35.259 
shortcut in that folder when your

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:37.950 
shortcut in that folder when your
machine<00:01:35.440> starts<00:01:36.130> so<00:01:37.000> although<00:01:37.300> boot<00:01:37.630> camp<00:01:37.840> is

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:37.960 
machine starts so although boot camp is

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:39.900 
machine starts so although boot camp is
meant<00:01:38.500> to<00:01:38.590> start<00:01:38.770> by<00:01:38.890> default<00:01:39.190> anyway<00:01:39.490> on<00:01:39.700> the

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:39.910 
meant to start by default anyway on the

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:41.940 
meant to start by default anyway on the
times<00:01:40.119> it<00:01:40.270> doesn't<00:01:40.600> what<00:01:41.170> that<00:01:41.410> will<00:01:41.560> do<00:01:41.679> is

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:41.950 
times it doesn't what that will do is

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:43.440 
times it doesn't what that will do is
that<00:01:42.190> will<00:01:42.340> force<00:01:42.640> it<00:01:42.789> to<00:01:42.909> start<00:01:43.179> up<00:01:43.240> and<00:01:43.420> run

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.450 
that will force it to start up and run

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:47.730 
that will force it to start up and run
it<00:01:43.630> manually<00:01:43.929> the<00:01:44.350> way<00:01:44.440> you<00:01:44.500> just<00:01:44.590> did<00:01:46.440> so<00:01:47.440> that

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:47.740 
it manually the way you just did so that

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:49.290 
it manually the way you just did so that
you<00:01:47.830> won't<00:01:48.009> have<00:01:48.159> any<00:01:48.340> issues<00:01:48.429> with<00:01:48.729> drivers

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:49.300 
you won't have any issues with drivers

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:51.090 
you won't have any issues with drivers
not<00:01:49.420> starting<00:01:49.840> when<00:01:50.259> you<00:01:50.350> start<00:01:50.619> because<00:01:50.979> if

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:51.100 
not starting when you start because if

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:52.499 
not starting when you start because if
it<00:01:51.220> doesn't<00:01:51.490> start<00:01:51.640> properly<00:01:52.060> it<00:01:52.300> will<00:01:52.390> be

00:01:52.499 --> 00:01:52.509 
it doesn't start properly it will be

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:54.120 
it doesn't start properly it will be
forced<00:01:52.840> to<00:01:52.899> start<00:01:53.110> up<00:01:53.200> afterwards<00:01:53.649> so<00:01:53.979> it's

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.130 
forced to start up afterwards so it's

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:57.330 
forced to start up afterwards so it's
effectively<00:01:54.490> stating<00:01:55.179> it<00:01:55.270> like<00:01:55.860> it<00:01:56.860> will<00:01:57.130> try

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:57.340

to tie it twice but it kind of you see
site<00:02:00.250> twice<00:02:00.430> because<00:02:00.640> if<00:02:00.759> you<00:02:00.820> started<00:02:01.090> once

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:01.329

it won't started again kind of thing I
had<00:02:05.020> this<00:02:05.110> issue<00:02:05.259> like<00:02:05.590> half<00:02:05.770> an<00:02:05.890> hour<00:02:05.950> ago<00:02:06.009> and

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:06.189 
had this issue like half an hour ago and

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:07.980 
had this issue like half an hour ago and
I<00:02:06.280> looked<00:02:06.430> on<00:02:06.520> the<00:02:06.579> forums<00:02:07.030> the<00:02:07.450> Apple<00:02:07.689> forums

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:07.990

I looked on the forums the Apple forums
and<00:02:08.170> there<00:02:08.259> was<00:02:08.380> like<00:02:08.590> no<00:02:08.860> fix<00:02:09.280> really<00:02:09.700> so<00:02:09.940> I

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
and there was like no fix really so I

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:12.630
