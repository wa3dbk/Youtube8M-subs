moving<00:01:07.530> on<00:01:07.860> into<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.490> shoe<00:01:08.790> here<00:01:09.119> is<00:01:09.210> the<00:01:09.360> mesh

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
moving on into the shoe here is the mesh

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.190 
moving on into the shoe here is the mesh
part<00:01:10.159> just<00:01:11.159> goes<00:01:11.340> from<00:01:11.490> here<00:01:11.820> and<00:01:11.880> then<00:01:12.180> just<00:01:12.990> a

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
part just goes from here and then just a

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.450 
part just goes from here and then just a
toe<00:01:13.439> box<00:01:13.680> as<00:01:13.860> mush<00:01:15.259> come<00:01:16.259> around<00:01:16.500> the<00:01:16.770> edge<00:01:16.890> we

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
toe box as mush come around the edge we

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:23.149 
toe box as mush come around the edge we
have<00:01:17.700> a<00:01:18.470> little<00:01:20.119> like<00:01:21.119> a<00:01:21.650> rubber<00:01:22.650> material

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
have a little like a rubber material

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.030 
have a little like a rubber material
surrounding<00:01:24.119> the<00:01:24.240> edges<00:01:24.630> so<00:01:25.409> they<00:01:25.530> don't<00:01:25.680> rip

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
surrounding the edges so they don't rip

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:31.219 
surrounding the edges so they don't rip
I'm<00:01:26.310> assuming<00:01:26.880> that's<00:01:27.600> for<00:01:28.579> um<00:01:30.079> you<00:01:31.079> know
