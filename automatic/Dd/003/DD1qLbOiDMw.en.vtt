00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:02.700 
okay Lucas you had a tremendous start to

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.579 
okay Lucas you had a tremendous start to
last<00:00:02.909> season<00:00:03.360> then<00:00:03.570> obviously<00:00:03.780> disaster

00:00:04.579 --> 00:00:04.589 
last season then obviously disaster

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:06.440 
last season then obviously disaster
struck<00:00:04.830> with<00:00:05.009> the<00:00:05.040> injury<00:00:05.460> against<00:00:06.089> Chelsea

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:06.450 
struck with the injury against Chelsea

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:08.660 
struck with the injury against Chelsea
how<00:00:06.930> difficult<00:00:07.230> was<00:00:07.620> it<00:00:07.680> to<00:00:07.859> watch<00:00:08.250> the<00:00:08.490> rest

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670 
how difficult was it to watch the rest

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:10.280 
how difficult was it to watch the rest
of<00:00:08.790> the<00:00:08.849> season<00:00:09.030> and<00:00:09.360> watch<00:00:09.840> the<00:00:10.080> team

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
of the season and watch the team

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.580 
of the season and watch the team
struggle<00:00:11.130> without<00:00:11.219> you<00:00:11.519> being<00:00:11.759> inside<00:00:12.559> well<00:00:13.559> I

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
struggle without you being inside well I

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.580 
struggle without you being inside well I
think<00:00:13.799> it's<00:00:14.630> it's<00:00:15.630> difficult<00:00:16.170> when<00:00:16.350> you<00:00:16.470> are

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
think it's it's difficult when you are

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.970 
think it's it's difficult when you are
out<00:00:16.770> of<00:00:16.980> the<00:00:17.130> team<00:00:17.779> for<00:00:18.779> some<00:00:19.020> reason<00:00:19.529> but

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
out of the team for some reason but

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.189 
out of the team for some reason but
especially<00:00:20.250> on<00:00:20.670> my<00:00:21.090> case<00:00:21.390> I<00:00:21.420> think<00:00:21.660> it<00:00:22.020> was

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
especially on my case I think it was

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.130 
especially on my case I think it was
even<00:00:22.410> harder<00:00:23.010> because<00:00:23.600> you<00:00:24.600> know<00:00:24.720> it<00:00:24.900> was<00:00:25.109> a

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
even harder because you know it was a

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.519 
even harder because you know it was a
serious<00:00:25.650> injury<00:00:26.220> I<00:00:26.340> need<00:00:26.760> I<00:00:27.210> need<00:00:27.779> to<00:00:28.080> have<00:00:28.289> an

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
serious injury I need I need to have an

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.370 
serious injury I need I need to have an
operation<00:00:29.160> so<00:00:29.849> it<00:00:30.359> was<00:00:30.630> a<00:00:30.660> complicated

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
operation so it was a complicated

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.319 
operation so it was a complicated
surgery<00:00:32.750> so<00:00:33.750> it<00:00:33.989> was<00:00:34.260> a<00:00:34.739> difficult<00:00:35.579> moment<00:00:35.940> in

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
surgery so it was a difficult moment in

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.040 
surgery so it was a difficult moment in
my<00:00:36.480> career<00:00:36.540> but<00:00:36.960> I<00:00:37.680> got<00:00:38.250> through<00:00:38.460> it<00:00:38.579> and<00:00:39.059> ready

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
my career but I got through it and ready

last season watching the tail end of the
season<00:00:55.770> you<00:00:56.129> have<00:00:56.340> two<00:00:57.059> different<00:00:57.270> scenarios

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
season you have two different scenarios

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.360 
season you have two different scenarios
Liverpool<00:00:58.230> doing<00:00:58.500> very<00:00:58.800> well<00:00:59.039> in<00:00:59.070> cup

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
Liverpool doing very well in cup

Liverpool doing very well in cup
competitions<00:00:59.550> to<00:01:00.300> cup<00:01:00.570> finals<00:01:01.020> but<00:01:01.559> a

competitions to cup finals but a

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.319 
competitions to cup finals but a

disappointing eighth place finish in the

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.509 
disappointing eighth place finish in the
league<00:01:03.539> how<00:01:04.199> would<00:01:04.350> you<00:01:04.379> categorize<00:01:04.739> that<00:01:05.309> is

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
league how would you categorize that is

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.670 
league how would you categorize that is
that<00:01:05.700> a<00:01:05.729> successful<00:01:06.540> season<00:01:06.720> or<00:01:07.170> does<00:01:07.530> the

that a successful season or does the

that a successful season or does the
league<00:01:07.830> position<00:01:08.070> mean<00:01:08.430> it's<00:01:08.580> not<00:01:08.760> a

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
league position mean it's not a

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.670 
league position mean it's not a
successful<00:01:09.360> season<00:01:09.479> well<00:01:09.990> if<00:01:10.260> you<00:01:10.409> think

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
successful season well if you think

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.700 
successful season well if you think
about<00:01:10.770> the<00:01:11.100> cups<00:01:11.689> it<00:01:12.689> was<00:01:12.990> a<00:01:13.020> successful

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
about the cups it was a successful

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.240 
about the cups it was a successful
season<00:01:14.070> but<00:01:14.490> we<00:01:15.090> know<00:01:15.270> the<00:01:15.509> main<00:01:15.720> main

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:16.250 
season but we know the main main

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:19.730 
season but we know the main main
competition<00:01:17.250> for<00:01:17.759> us<00:01:17.909> it<00:01:18.659> was<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.200> Premier

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
competition for us it was the Premier

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.460 
competition for us it was the Premier
League<00:01:19.770> and<00:01:20.100> it's<00:01:20.939> clear<00:01:21.240> that<00:01:21.270> we<00:01:21.659> were<00:01:22.290> not

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
League and it's clear that we were not

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.850 
League and it's clear that we were not
good<00:01:22.710> enough<00:01:23.040> and<00:01:23.840> maybe<00:01:24.840> were<00:01:25.170> a<00:01:25.200> bit<00:01:25.530> unlucky

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
good enough and maybe were a bit unlucky

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.690 
good enough and maybe were a bit unlucky
in<00:01:26.100> a<00:01:26.189> few<00:01:26.400> games<00:01:26.610> but<00:01:27.060> in<00:01:27.659> terms<00:01:27.869> of<00:01:28.700> during

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
in a few games but in terms of during

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.569 
in a few games but in terms of during
the<00:01:29.729> 38<00:01:30.240> games<00:01:30.600> I<00:01:30.869> think<00:01:31.170> we<00:01:31.380> we<00:01:31.860> didn't<00:01:32.220> play

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
the 38 games I think we we didn't play

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:36.440 
the 38 games I think we we didn't play
our<00:01:32.850> best<00:01:33.150> and<00:01:33.680> and<00:01:34.680> they<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.759> league<00:01:35.939> table<00:01:36.180> I

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
our best and and they the league table I

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.840 
our best and and they the league table I
think<00:01:36.720> don't<00:01:36.930> lie<00:01:37.110> and<00:01:37.470> you<00:01:38.100> just<00:01:38.310> have<00:01:38.610> to

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
think don't lie and you just have to

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.940 
think don't lie and you just have to
realize<00:01:39.659> that<00:01:39.900> we<00:01:40.049> need<00:01:40.229> to<00:01:40.259> do<00:01:40.500> a<00:01:40.530> lot<00:01:40.740> better

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
realize that we need to do a lot better

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.880 
realize that we need to do a lot better
this<00:01:41.310> season<00:01:41.549> to<00:01:42.119> be<00:01:42.329> you<00:01:43.079> know<00:01:43.229> where<00:01:43.470> we<00:01:43.649> want

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
this season to be you know where we want

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:49.670 
this season to be you know where we want
to<00:01:43.950> be<00:01:44.070> it's<00:01:44.780> on<00:01:45.780> top<00:01:46.200> and<00:01:47.450> hopefully<00:01:48.680> coming

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
to be it's on top and hopefully coming

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.649 
to be it's on top and hopefully coming
playing<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:50.670> Champions<00:01:51.149> League<00:01:51.210> again

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
playing the Champions League again

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.660 
playing the Champions League again
that's<00:01:51.960> the<00:01:52.170> main<00:01:52.350> target<00:01:52.799> for<00:01:53.009> us<00:01:53.159> of<00:01:53.430> course

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
that's the main target for us of course

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.700 
that's the main target for us of course
and<00:01:54.090> I<00:01:54.750> think<00:01:55.470> we're<00:01:55.799> a<00:01:56.159> Liverpool<00:01:56.759> should<00:01:57.030> be

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:57.710 
and I think we're a Liverpool should be

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:59.990 
and I think we're a Liverpool should be
challenging<00:01:58.710> every<00:01:59.070> single<00:01:59.399> season<00:01:59.610> and

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
challenging every single season and

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.990 
challenging every single season and
that's<00:02:00.960> what<00:02:01.200> we<00:02:01.439> try<00:02:02.100> to<00:02:02.130> do<00:02:02.430> this<00:02:02.759> season

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
that's what we try to do this season

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.179 
that's what we try to do this season
well<00:02:03.570> last<00:02:03.869> year<00:02:04.079> it<00:02:04.439> was<00:02:04.469> under<00:02:04.829> kind<00:02:05.009> of<00:02:05.100> the

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
well last year it was under kind of the

played with a lot of confidence when he

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.449 
played with a lot of confidence when he
was<00:02:35.430> the<00:02:35.609> manager<00:02:36.019> but<00:02:37.019> football<00:02:37.530> it's<00:02:38.159> like

00:02:41.149 --> 00:02:41.159 
that it's not only with the manager but

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:44.509 
that it's not only with the manager but
players<00:02:41.970> going<00:02:42.450> and<00:02:42.780> coming<00:02:43.019> a<00:02:43.409> lot<00:02:44.040> of<00:02:44.069> change

played<00:03:33.569> in<00:03:33.959> our<00:03:34.109> field<00:03:34.379> and<00:03:34.739> it<00:03:34.859> was<00:03:35.129> a<00:03:35.519> very

00:03:36.409 --> 00:03:36.419 
played in our field and it was a very

00:03:36.419 --> 00:03:40.099 
played in our field and it was a very
difficult<00:03:36.959> game<00:03:37.949> to<00:03:37.980> play<00:03:38.340> a<00:03:38.870> difficult<00:03:39.870> team

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:40.109 
difficult game to play a difficult team

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:42.800 
difficult game to play a difficult team
to<00:03:40.319> play<00:03:40.470> against<00:03:41.040> and<00:03:41.310> they<00:03:42.060> styled<00:03:42.629> that

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
to play against and they styled that

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:45.920 
to play against and they styled that
they<00:03:43.440> played<00:03:44.250> it<00:03:44.639> was<00:03:44.879> very<00:03:45.120> hard<00:03:45.389> to<00:03:45.479> get<00:03:45.780> the

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
they played it was very hard to get the

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.949 
they played it was very hard to get the
ball<00:03:46.109> and<00:03:46.500> they<00:03:46.979> always<00:03:47.220> kept<00:03:48.180> the<00:03:48.299> possession

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 
ball and they always kept the possession

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:51.830 
ball and they always kept the possession
very<00:03:49.229> well<00:03:49.470> so<00:03:49.979> i<00:03:50.340> think<00:03:50.909> the<00:03:51.269> principal<00:03:51.750> will

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
very well so i think the principal will

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.409 
very well so i think the principal will
be<00:03:52.019> exactly<00:03:52.560> the<00:03:52.769> same<00:03:52.799> liverpool<00:03:53.790> you<00:03:54.060> try<00:03:54.359> to

00:03:54.409 --> 00:03:54.419 
be exactly the same liverpool you try to

00:03:54.419 --> 00:03:58.039 
be exactly the same liverpool you try to
put<00:03:54.780> a<00:03:55.010> display<00:03:56.010> the<00:03:56.190> same<00:03:56.400> way<00:03:56.549> that<00:03:56.790> he<00:03:57.049> they

00:03:58.039 --> 00:03:58.049 
put a display the same way that he they

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:02.899 
put a display the same way that he they
played<00:03:58.349> in<00:03:59.340> in<00:03:59.729> swansea<00:04:00.359> so<00:04:01.250> we<00:04:02.250> hope<00:04:02.459> with<00:04:02.729> the

00:04:02.899 --> 00:04:02.909 
played in in swansea so we hope with the

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:05.469 
played in in swansea so we hope with the
players<00:04:03.180> that<00:04:03.239> we<00:04:03.540> have<00:04:03.750> and<00:04:04.049> with<00:04:04.769> a<00:04:04.949> few<00:04:05.159> more

00:04:05.469 --> 00:04:05.479 
players that we have and with a few more

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:07.879 
players that we have and with a few more
players<00:04:06.479> coming<00:04:06.900> I<00:04:07.169> think<00:04:07.379> we'll<00:04:07.620> have<00:04:07.829> a

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:07.889

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:19.460 
you talked about the style of play at
Swansea<00:04:18.299> it<00:04:18.389> should<00:04:18.570> be<00:04:18.659> a<00:04:18.690> simple<00:04:18.750> transition

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.470 
Swansea it should be a simple transition

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:21.379 
Swansea it should be a simple transition
given<00:04:20.190> Liverpool<00:04:20.549> are<00:04:20.579> known<00:04:20.880> to<00:04:21.090> be<00:04:21.120> that

00:04:21.379 --> 00:04:21.389 
given Liverpool are known to be that

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:23.659 
given Liverpool are known to be that
style<00:04:21.750> of<00:04:21.870> team<00:04:22.079> a<00:04:22.109> passing<00:04:22.680> team<00:04:23.190> with<00:04:23.490> the

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:23.669 
style of team a passing team with the

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:31.939 
midfield yeah well
I<00:04:27.360> think<00:04:28.139> they<00:04:28.349> you<00:04:28.949> know<00:04:28.979> we<00:04:29.280> have<00:04:29.490> a<00:04:30.860> more<00:04:31.860> or

00:04:31.939 --> 00:04:31.949 
I think they you know we have a more or

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:33.740 
I think they you know we have a more or
less<00:04:32.069> the<00:04:32.190> same<00:04:32.220> mentality<00:04:32.759> the<00:04:33.240> way<00:04:33.389> we<00:04:33.569> want

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:33.750 
less the same mentality the way we want

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:37.550 
less the same mentality the way we want
to<00:04:33.810> play<00:04:33.949> is<00:04:34.949> just<00:04:35.250> a<00:04:35.370> question<00:04:35.819> of<00:04:36.560> adjustment

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:37.560 
to play is just a question of adjustment

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:41.839 
to play is just a question of adjustment
in<00:04:37.800> terms<00:04:38.099> of<00:04:38.330> position<00:04:39.330> or<00:04:39.889> you<00:04:40.889> know<00:04:41.009> play

00:04:41.839 --> 00:04:41.849 
in terms of position or you know play

00:04:41.849 --> 00:04:45.020 
in terms of position or you know play
the<00:04:42.120> way<00:04:42.330> exactly<00:04:42.990> the<00:04:43.440> way<00:04:43.620> he<00:04:43.650> wants<00:04:43.860> us<00:04:44.699> to

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:45.030 
the way exactly the way he wants us to

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:47.930 
the way exactly the way he wants us to
play<00:04:45.210> it<00:04:46.050> will<00:04:46.349> have<00:04:46.590> a<00:04:46.620> few<00:04:47.099> chains<00:04:47.370> of<00:04:47.610> course

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940 
play it will have a few chains of course

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:52.029 
play it will have a few chains of course
but<00:04:48.509> I<00:04:49.259> don't<00:04:49.740> think<00:04:49.889> will<00:04:50.159> be<00:04:50.340> a<00:04:50.940> massive

00:04:52.029 --> 00:04:52.039 
but I don't think will be a massive

00:04:52.039 --> 00:04:57.020 
but I don't think will be a massive
