00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.110 
negative positive positive
so<00:03:06.830> again<00:03:07.040> if<00:03:07.190> you<00:03:07.310> need<00:03:07.520> to<00:03:07.640> remove<00:03:07.940> it

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120 
so again if you need to remove it

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.030 
so again if you need to remove it
because<00:03:08.660> because<00:03:08.900> you<00:03:09.170> got<00:03:09.320> the<00:03:09.530> pleiades

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
because because you got the pleiades

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.880 
because because you got the pleiades
mixed<00:03:10.460> around<00:03:10.870> just<00:03:11.870> twist<00:03:12.140> it<00:03:12.290> like<00:03:12.350> this<00:03:12.470> and

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:12.890 
mixed around just twist it like this and

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:14.710 
mixed around just twist it like this and
then<00:03:13.340> pop<00:03:13.550> it<00:03:13.700> out<00:03:13.790> and<00:03:13.850> it<00:03:14.180> should<00:03:14.300> choose<00:03:14.690> a

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 
then pop it out and it should choose a

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:18.840 
then pop it out and it should choose a
backhand<00:03:15.250> lock<00:03:16.250> it<00:03:16.400> in<00:03:16.460> place<00:03:16.610> like<00:03:16.850> that<00:03:17.530> okay

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:18.850 
backhand lock it in place like that okay

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:21.850 
backhand lock it in place like that okay
get<00:03:19.850> your<00:03:19.880> wire<00:03:20.240> that's<00:03:20.750> going<00:03:20.930> to<00:03:20.990> be<00:03:21.050> d<00:03:21.680> let's

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:21.860 
get your wire that's going to be d let's

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:22.890 
get your wire that's going to be d let's
go<00:03:21.950> into<00:03:22.250> this<00:03:22.340> hole

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 
go into this hole

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.170 
go into this hole
straining<00:03:23.900> it<00:03:24.170> out<00:03:24.290> like<00:03:24.500> this<00:03:24.790> the<00:03:25.790> bottom

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:26.180 
straining it out like this the bottom

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:28.000 
straining it out like this the bottom
wire<00:03:26.360> is<00:03:26.600> the<00:03:26.780> negative<00:03:26.959> and<00:03:27.380> the<00:03:27.500> top<00:03:27.680> bar<00:03:27.890> is

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.010 
wire is the negative and the top bar is

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:30.430 
wire is the negative and the top bar is
the<00:03:28.160> positive<00:03:28.510> so<00:03:29.510> when<00:03:29.840> you<00:03:29.930> connect<00:03:30.260> this

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:30.440 
the positive so when you connect this

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:33.550 
the positive so when you connect this
led<00:03:30.800> in<00:03:31.360> put<00:03:32.360> the<00:03:32.510> negative<00:03:32.720> towards<00:03:33.470> the

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.560 
led in put the negative towards the

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:36.610 
led in put the negative towards the
bottom<00:03:33.740> and<00:03:34.100> positive<00:03:34.670> up<00:03:34.910> top<00:03:35.270> so<00:03:35.300> again<00:03:35.930> it's

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:36.620 
bottom and positive up top so again it's

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:38.530 
bottom and positive up top so again it's
straight<00:03:37.040> like<00:03:37.190> this<00:03:37.430> so<00:03:38.030> make<00:03:38.180> sure<00:03:38.209> it's<00:03:38.420> not

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:38.540 
straight like this so make sure it's not

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:41.140 
straight like this so make sure it's not
twisted<00:03:38.780> or<00:03:39.080> knotted<00:03:39.440> the<00:03:40.160> bottom<00:03:40.490> one<00:03:40.640> is<00:03:40.820> a

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.150 
twisted or knotted the bottom one is a

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:43.510 
twisted or knotted the bottom one is a
negative<00:03:41.540> and<00:03:41.630> ones<00:03:42.020> positive<00:03:42.400> when<00:03:43.400> you

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:43.520 
negative and ones positive when you

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:45.880 
negative and ones positive when you
reinstall<00:03:43.959> make<00:03:44.959> sure<00:03:45.110> you<00:03:45.230> wire<00:03:45.470> these

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:45.890 
reinstall make sure you wire these

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:47.979 
reinstall make sure you wire these
things<00:03:46.280> up<00:03:46.640> through<00:03:47.060> back<00:03:47.209> here<00:03:47.480> before<00:03:47.690> you

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:55.459 
you just push it against put it down put

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:57.880 
you just push it against put it down put
the<00:03:55.610> screw<00:03:55.910> back<00:03:56.209> in<00:03:56.510> there<00:03:56.870> put<00:03:57.560> the<00:03:57.680> two

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:57.890 
the screw back in there put the two

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:12.460 
the screw back in there put the two
screws<00:03:58.510> down<00:03:59.510> here

headlights<00:04:39.570> all<00:04:40.570> this<00:04:40.900> one<00:04:41.200> should<00:04:41.620> light<00:04:41.830> up

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:41.860 
headlights all this one should light up

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:45.180 
headlights all this one should light up
this<00:04:42.490> row<00:04:42.780> will<00:04:43.780> light<00:04:43.930> up<00:04:44.110> and<00:04:44.290> this<00:04:44.470> one<00:04:44.710> will

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:45.190 
this row will light up and this one will

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:51.560 
this row will light up and this one will
light<00:04:45.370> up<00:04:47.130> hard<00:04:48.130> to<00:04:48.190> see<00:04:48.370> but<00:04:48.610> the<00:04:48.910> light<00:04:49.120> stuff

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:51.570 

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:53.970 

and<00:04:52.570> this<00:04:52.750> is<00:04:52.870> what<00:04:53.080> it<00:04:53.200> looks<00:04:53.350> like<00:04:53.470> what<00:04:53.800> the
