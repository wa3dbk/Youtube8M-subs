today<00:00:08.010> i<00:00:08.040> want<00:00:08.490> to<00:00:08.519> show<00:00:08.849> you<00:00:08.880> two<00:00:09.840> knots<00:00:10.110> that

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
today i want to show you two knots that

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.070 
today i want to show you two knots that
we<00:00:10.469> use<00:00:10.710> to<00:00:11.400> tie<00:00:11.610> our<00:00:11.639> ropes<00:00:12.120> to<00:00:12.630> our<00:00:12.780> anchor

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
we use to tie our ropes to our anchor

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.070 
we use to tie our ropes to our anchor
points<00:00:13.940> first<00:00:14.940> i'll<00:00:15.120> show<00:00:15.330> you<00:00:15.389> the<00:00:15.660> overhand

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
points first i'll show you the overhand

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.570 
points first i'll show you the overhand
loop<00:00:16.289> knowledge<00:00:16.710> which<00:00:16.980> is<00:00:17.130> a<00:00:17.160> very<00:00:17.340> simple

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
loop knowledge which is a very simple

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.609 
loop knowledge which is a very simple
not<00:00:18.020> take<00:00:19.020> my<00:00:19.170> rope<00:00:19.380> and<00:00:19.560> I<00:00:20.039> create<00:00:20.490> a<00:00:20.699> barge

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:21.619 
not take my rope and I create a barge

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:28.790 
not take my rope and I create a barge
and<00:00:22.619> I<00:00:22.740> simply<00:00:23.070> wrap<00:00:24.410> throw<00:00:25.410> under<00:00:25.800> I<00:00:27.800> make

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
and I simply wrap throw under I make

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.020 
and I simply wrap throw under I make
this<00:00:28.949> loop<00:00:29.189> here<00:00:30.859> now<00:00:31.859> take<00:00:32.340> the<00:00:32.489> folded<00:00:32.910> end

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
this loop here now take the folded end

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.780 
this loop here now take the folded end
of<00:00:33.120> the<00:00:33.210> row<00:00:34.399> pass<00:00:35.399> it<00:00:35.579> back<00:00:35.730> over<00:00:37.489> and<00:00:38.489> through

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
of the row pass it back over and through

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.850 
of the row pass it back over and through
the<00:00:38.879> loop<00:00:41.090> the<00:00:42.090> more<00:00:42.300> I<00:00:42.329> pull<00:00:42.660> is<00:00:42.899> not<00:00:43.140> the

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
the loop the more I pull is not the

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.700 
the loop the more I pull is not the
tighter<00:00:44.160> it<00:00:44.280> gets<00:00:44.450> so<00:00:45.450> much<00:00:45.690> that<00:00:46.230> if<00:00:46.350> the<00:00:46.500> Rope

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
tighter it gets so much that if the Rope

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.069 
tighter it gets so much that if the Rope
was<00:00:46.920> to<00:00:47.070> take<00:00:47.219> a<00:00:47.280> heavy<00:00:47.579> load<00:00:47.879> it<00:00:48.539> could<00:00:48.780> become

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
was to take a heavy load it could become

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.970 
was to take a heavy load it could become
almost<00:00:49.289> impossible<00:00:49.590> to<00:00:50.219> undo<00:00:50.520> this<00:00:50.670> not<00:00:51.980> now

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
almost impossible to undo this not now

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.180 
almost impossible to undo this not now
I'm<00:00:53.219> able<00:00:53.399> to<00:00:54.239> attach<00:00:54.480> my<00:00:54.660> carabiner<00:00:55.140> to<00:00:56.100> the

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
I'm able to attach my carabiner to the

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.800 
I'm able to attach my carabiner to the
road

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:01.810 

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:05.180 

now<00:01:02.230> I'll<00:01:02.650> show<00:01:02.710> you<00:01:03.010> the<00:01:03.460> figure<00:01:03.880> 8<00:01:04.030> on<00:01:04.300> a<00:01:04.420> bike

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:05.190 
now I'll show you the figure 8 on a bike

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:10.020 
now I'll show you the figure 8 on a bike
again<00:01:06.190> on<00:01:07.060> the<00:01:07.240> back<00:01:07.450> of<00:01:07.480> my<00:01:07.690> rope<00:01:08.940> then<00:01:09.940> I

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:10.030 
again on the back of my rope then I

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:12.180 
again on the back of my rope then I
start<00:01:10.390> off<00:01:10.570> just<00:01:11.260> like<00:01:11.380> the<00:01:11.620> overhead<00:01:11.980> look

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:12.190 
start off just like the overhead look

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:19.440 
start off just like the overhead look
nice<00:01:14.190> with<00:01:15.190> the<00:01:15.340> loop<00:01:17.490> and<00:01:18.490> I<00:01:18.580> wrap<00:01:18.760> the<00:01:18.790> folded

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:19.450 
nice with the loop and I wrap the folded

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:28.130 
nice with the loop and I wrap the folded
over<00:01:19.630> again<00:01:22.650> to<00:01:23.650> form<00:01:24.490> this<00:01:24.960> figure<00:01:25.960> 8<00:01:26.080> show

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
over again to form this figure 8 show

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.690 
over again to form this figure 8 show
take<00:01:29.140> a<00:01:29.170> fold<00:01:29.500> it<00:01:29.650> into<00:01:29.800> bro<00:01:32.370> pass<00:01:33.370> it<00:01:33.580> back

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:33.700 
take a fold it into bro pass it back

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:38.820 
take a fold it into bro pass it back
through<00:01:33.940> the<00:01:34.030> loop<00:01:36.960> here<00:01:37.960> I<00:01:38.050> have<00:01:38.229> figure<00:01:38.710> 8<00:01:38.800> on

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:38.830 
through the loop here I have figure 8 on

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:41.250 
through the loop here I have figure 8 on
a<00:01:39.010> barge<00:01:39.280> as<00:01:39.550> you<00:01:40.450> can<00:01:40.570> see<00:01:40.720> the<00:01:40.840> figure<00:01:41.110> eight

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:41.260 
a barge as you can see the figure eight

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.190 
a barge as you can see the figure eight
is<00:01:41.440> slightly<00:01:41.710> larger<00:01:41.979> and<00:01:42.490> users<00:01:42.850> more<00:01:43.030> up<00:01:43.270> the

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.200 
is slightly larger and users more up the

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:45.870 
is slightly larger and users more up the
figure<00:01:44.470> eight<00:01:44.619> on<00:01:44.830> a<00:01:44.950> barge<00:01:45.220> is<00:01:45.490> also<00:01:45.850> a

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:45.880 
figure eight on a barge is also a

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.990 
figure eight on a barge is also a
stronger<00:01:46.360> knowledge<00:01:46.660> and<00:01:47.170> again<00:01:47.470> I<00:01:48.000> can

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:49.000 
stronger knowledge and again I can

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.040 
stronger knowledge and again I can
attach<00:01:49.270> my<00:01:49.450> caramel<00:01:51.180> with<00:01:52.180> my<00:01:52.360> carabiner<00:01:52.900> and

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:53.050 
attach my caramel with my carabiner and

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:55.650 
attach my caramel with my carabiner and
rope<00:01:53.320> attached<00:01:53.740> I<00:01:54.009> am<00:01:54.190> now<00:01:54.369> ready<00:01:54.700> to<00:01:54.790> prepare

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:55.660 
rope attached I am now ready to prepare

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:58.980 
rope attached I am now ready to prepare
the<00:01:55.810> anchor<00:01:56.050> point<00:01:56.200> I<00:01:57.060> dip<00:01:58.060> the<00:01:58.090> rope<00:01:58.750> and

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:58.990 
the anchor point I dip the rope and

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:01.020 
the anchor point I dip the rope and
caravana<00:01:59.500> through<00:02:00.070> this<00:02:00.250> hole<00:02:00.490> that<00:02:00.729> I<00:02:00.820> free

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.030 
caravana through this hole that I free

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:04.560 
caravana through this hole that I free
made<00:02:01.300> in<00:02:01.960> the<00:02:02.140> tiles<00:02:02.670> wrap<00:02:03.670> the<00:02:03.970> rope<00:02:04.300> and
