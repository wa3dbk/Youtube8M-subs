00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:18.130 
other day and learned how to tie this
rattlesnake<00:00:16.670> tail<00:00:17.060> this<00:00:17.420> rattlesnake<00:00:17.750> not

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:18.140 
rattlesnake tail this rattlesnake not

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:19.750 
rattlesnake tail this rattlesnake not
thought<00:00:18.770> it<00:00:18.890> was<00:00:19.039> the<00:00:19.160> coolest<00:00:19.190> thing<00:00:19.730> I

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:19.760 
thought it was the coolest thing I

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:21.490 
thought it was the coolest thing I
started<00:00:20.210> tying<00:00:20.390> it<00:00:20.600> in<00:00:20.690> different<00:00:20.810> colors<00:00:21.470> and

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:21.500 
started tying it in different colors and

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.980 
started tying it in different colors and
whatnot<00:00:22.040> in<00:00:22.310> different<00:00:22.970> configurations<00:00:23.120> and

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:23.990 
whatnot in different configurations and

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:26.550 
whatnot in different configurations and
then<00:00:24.620> came<00:00:25.100> up<00:00:25.250> with<00:00:25.460> tying<00:00:25.670> it<00:00:25.820> in<00:00:25.940> the<00:00:26.120> green

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:26.560 
then came up with tying it in the green

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.110 
then came up with tying it in the green
typical<00:00:27.560> OD<00:00:27.830> and<00:00:28.040> then<00:00:28.490> did<00:00:28.640> it<00:00:28.790> in<00:00:28.910> this

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:29.120 
typical OD and then did it in this

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:31.840 
typical OD and then did it in this
coyote<00:00:29.870> color<00:00:30.350> and<00:00:30.620> thought<00:00:31.160> this<00:00:31.340> one<00:00:31.550> looks

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:31.850 
coyote color and thought this one looks

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:34.240 
coyote color and thought this one looks
really<00:00:32.210> cool<00:00:32.419> so<00:00:33.110> then<00:00:33.290> I<00:00:33.320> tried<00:00:33.469> it<00:00:33.829> in<00:00:33.980> a

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:34.250 
really cool so then I tried it in a

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:36.489 
really cool so then I tried it in a
couple<00:00:34.610> of<00:00:34.670> the<00:00:34.820> natural<00:00:35.000> materials<00:00:35.839> some<00:00:36.410> of

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:36.499 
couple of the natural materials some of

00:00:36.499 --> 00:00:39.369 
couple of the natural materials some of
these<00:00:36.589> twines<00:00:36.980> and<00:00:37.600> didn't<00:00:38.600> tie<00:00:39.019> the<00:00:39.079> most

00:00:39.369 --> 00:00:39.379 
these twines and didn't tie the most

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:40.989 
these twines and didn't tie the most
pretty<00:00:39.829> not<00:00:40.010> but<00:00:40.339> I<00:00:40.370> think<00:00:40.429> they<00:00:40.699> do<00:00:40.760> a<00:00:40.910> pretty

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:40.999 
pretty not but I think they do a pretty

00:00:40.999 --> 00:00:43.180 
pretty not but I think they do a pretty
good<00:00:41.269> job<00:00:41.390> of<00:00:41.780> showing<00:00:42.050> you<00:00:42.230> that<00:00:42.409> even<00:00:42.829> with<00:00:43.159> a

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:43.190 
good job of showing you that even with a

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:45.610 
good job of showing you that even with a
crude<00:00:43.489> material<00:00:43.699> a<00:00:44.269> simple<00:00:44.839> not<00:00:45.170> like<00:00:45.379> this

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:45.620 
crude material a simple not like this

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:47.739 
crude material a simple not like this
rattlesnake<00:00:46.579> tail<00:00:46.789> can<00:00:47.390> be<00:00:47.510> pretty

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:47.749 
rattlesnake tail can be pretty

00:00:47.749 --> 00:00:49.899 
rattlesnake tail can be pretty
cool-looking<00:00:48.019> so<00:00:48.980> once<00:00:49.280> I<00:00:49.399> was<00:00:49.550> hooked<00:00:49.760> on

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:49.909 
cool-looking so once I was hooked on

00:00:49.909 --> 00:00:51.759 
cool-looking so once I was hooked on
this<00:00:50.269> channel<00:00:50.539> from<00:00:50.870> seeing<00:00:51.170> how<00:00:51.289> easy<00:00:51.499> it<00:00:51.679> was

00:00:51.759 --> 00:00:51.769 
this channel from seeing how easy it was

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:54.040 
this channel from seeing how easy it was
to<00:00:51.829> tie<00:00:52.100> this<00:00:52.159> one<00:00:52.370> I<00:00:52.760> started<00:00:53.390> digging<00:00:53.539> in<00:00:53.839> and

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:54.050

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.880 
tie I wouldn't call him a very elaborate
not<00:01:08.360> I<00:01:08.390> mean<00:01:08.750> maybe<00:01:08.930> moderate<00:01:09.469> difficulty

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:09.890 
not I mean maybe moderate difficulty

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:11.560 
not I mean maybe moderate difficulty

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:11.570 
once you know how to tie him though you

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:13.090 
once you know how to tie him though you
can<00:01:11.810> just<00:01:11.960> sit<00:01:12.140> there<00:01:12.259> and<00:01:12.409> tie<00:01:12.619> him<00:01:12.770> all<00:01:12.920> day

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:13.100 
can just sit there and tie him all day

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.850 
can just sit there and tie him all day
then<00:01:13.880> last<00:01:14.570> one<00:01:14.750> I<00:01:14.780> found<00:01:15.020> was<00:01:15.200> his<00:01:15.320> snake<00:01:15.619> knot

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:15.860

and<00:01:16.130> this<00:01:16.460> one<00:01:16.640> I<00:01:16.670> really<00:01:16.939> like<00:01:17.320> super<00:01:18.320> soft

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:18.590 
and this one I really like super soft

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:20.260 
and this one I really like super soft
flexible<00:01:19.219> it's<00:01:19.490> like<00:01:19.640> holding<00:01:19.820> a<00:01:20.060> toy

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270 
flexible it's like holding a toy

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:21.520 
flexible it's like holding a toy
caterpillar<00:01:20.899> in<00:01:21.079> your<00:01:21.170> hand<00:01:21.350> or<00:01:21.469> something

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:21.530 
caterpillar in your hand or something

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:24.719 
caterpillar in your hand or something
I've<00:01:22.310> on<00:01:22.610> terminated<00:01:23.360> these<00:01:23.539> with<00:01:23.840> the<00:01:24.170> balls

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:24.729 
I've on terminated these with the balls

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:27.850 
I've on terminated these with the balls
once<00:01:25.729> I<00:01:25.909> tied<00:01:26.509> that<00:01:26.539> first<00:01:26.990> one<00:01:27.259> I<00:01:27.500> tried<00:01:27.680> a

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:27.860 
once I tied that first one I tried a

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:29.980 
once I tied that first one I tried a
couple<00:01:28.070> more<00:01:28.460> to<00:01:28.610> get<00:01:28.729> in<00:01:28.880> practice<00:01:29.360> you<00:01:29.869> know

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:29.990 
couple more to get in practice you know

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:32.349 
couple more to get in practice you know
with<00:01:30.200> the<00:01:30.439> black<00:01:30.890> and<00:01:31.189> tan<00:01:31.399> the<00:01:31.820> green<00:01:32.090> and

00:01:32.349 --> 00:01:32.359 
with the black and tan the green and

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:33.999 
with the black and tan the green and
black<00:01:32.570> and<00:01:32.990> then<00:01:33.109> I<00:01:33.140> tied<00:01:33.409> this<00:01:33.560> one<00:01:33.770> in<00:01:33.890> green

00:01:33.999 --> 00:01:34.009 
black and then I tied this one in green

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:35.590 
black and then I tied this one in green
and<00:01:34.130> tan<00:01:34.399> I<00:01:34.460> think<00:01:34.759> this<00:01:34.850> is<00:01:34.909> my<00:01:35.149> favorite<00:01:35.420> one

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 
and tan I think this is my favorite one

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.840 
and tan I think this is my favorite one
and<00:01:36.320> again<00:01:36.530> it's<00:01:36.680> a<00:01:36.770> real<00:01:36.920> soft<00:01:37.219> one<00:01:37.549> so<00:01:37.759> if

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:37.850 
and again it's a real soft one so if

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:40.420 
and again it's a real soft one so if
