00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
and the second step to the stage would

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.610 
and the second step to the stage would
then<00:00:38.100> be<00:00:38.340> to<00:00:38.880> create<00:00:39.120> and<00:00:39.630> to<00:00:40.260> turn<00:00:40.470> the

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
then be to create and to turn the

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.770 
then be to create and to turn the
drawing<00:00:40.860> into<00:00:41.370> a<00:00:41.400> into<00:00:41.760> into<00:00:42.450> a<00:00:42.480> solidworks

drawing into a into into a solidworks
template<00:00:43.470> file<00:00:43.710> and<00:00:44.490> which<00:00:44.760> will<00:00:44.910> do<00:00:45.060> at<00:00:45.360> the

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:45.630 
template file and which will do at the

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:48.530 
template file and which will do at the
end<00:00:45.660> of<00:00:45.870> this<00:00:45.990> example<00:00:46.940> in<00:00:47.940> this<00:00:48.120> case<00:00:48.360> I<00:00:48.510> have

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:48.540 
end of this example in this case I have

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:50.780 
end of this example in this case I have
a<00:00:48.720> drawing<00:00:49.050> open<00:00:49.620> which<00:00:49.800> is<00:00:50.040> stored<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:50.400> ddm

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:50.790 
a drawing open which is stored the ddm

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:52.670 
a drawing open which is stored the ddm
and<00:00:51.240> and<00:00:51.990> all<00:00:52.110> we're<00:00:52.230> going<00:00:52.320> to<00:00:52.380> do<00:00:52.560> is

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
and and all we're going to do is

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.770 
and and all we're going to do is
basically<00:00:53.130> make<00:00:53.820> some<00:00:53.970> edits<00:00:54.090> to<00:00:54.300> the<00:00:54.450> title

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
basically make some edits to the title

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.290 
basically make some edits to the title
block<00:00:54.930> on<00:00:55.140> here<00:00:55.410> and<00:00:55.530> then<00:00:56.070> obviously<00:00:56.490> convert

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
block on here and then obviously convert

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.870 
block on here and then obviously convert
it<00:00:57.450> to<00:00:57.480> a<00:00:57.630> title<00:00:57.960> block<00:00:58.140> so<00:00:58.710> let's<00:00:58.950> zoom<00:00:59.130> in<00:00:59.310> to

00:00:59.870 --> 00:00:59.880 
it to a title block so let's zoom in to

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:03.440 
it to a title block so let's zoom in to
the<00:01:01.400> corner<00:01:02.400> of<00:01:02.430> the<00:01:02.670> drawing<00:01:02.880> where<00:01:03.240> we<00:01:03.330> can

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:03.450 
the corner of the drawing where we can

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:06.530 
the corner of the drawing where we can
do<00:01:03.540> some<00:01:03.600> work<00:01:04.820> as<00:01:05.820> you<00:01:06.030> can<00:01:06.120> see<00:01:06.270> the<00:01:06.390> drawing

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
do some work as you can see the drawing

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.780 
do some work as you can see the drawing
number<00:01:06.870> is<00:01:06.990> already<00:01:07.320> on<00:01:07.410> on<00:01:07.620> the<00:01:08.010> on<00:01:08.460> the

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
number is already on on the on the

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.370 
number is already on on the on the
border<00:01:09.060> but<00:01:09.540> this<00:01:09.720> droid<00:01:09.870> number<00:01:10.230> is

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
border but this droid number is

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.080 
border but this droid number is
reflecting<00:01:11.190> the<00:01:11.670> solidworks<00:01:13.340> file<00:01:14.340> name<00:01:14.580> so

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
reflecting the solidworks file name so

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.810 
reflecting the solidworks file name so
we're<00:01:15.240> going<00:01:15.330> to<00:01:15.420> convert<00:01:15.720> that<00:01:15.900> over<00:01:16.260> to<00:01:16.470> a

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:16.820 
we're going to convert that over to a

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.880 
we're going to convert that over to a
part<00:01:17.820> number<00:01:17.910> of<00:01:18.750> a<00:01:18.900> DDM<00:01:19.200> part<00:01:19.440> number<00:01:19.710> the

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
part number of a DDM part number the

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.770 
part number of a DDM part number the
first<00:01:20.100> thing<00:01:20.190> we<00:01:20.280> need<00:01:20.370> to<00:01:20.430> do<00:01:20.640> is<00:01:20.880> right<00:01:21.750> click

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
first thing we need to do is right click

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.940 
first thing we need to do is right click
on<00:01:22.080> sheet<00:01:22.260> here<00:01:22.620> and<00:01:22.800> edit<00:01:23.730> the<00:01:23.970> sheet<00:01:24.150> format

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:24.950 
on sheet here and edit the sheet format

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:27.860 
on sheet here and edit the sheet format
this<00:01:25.950> is<00:01:26.040> that<00:01:26.160> allow<00:01:26.370> us<00:01:26.520> to<00:01:26.670> pick<00:01:27.300> the<00:01:27.450> text

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:27.870 
this is that allow us to pick the text

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:30.340 
this is that allow us to pick the text
in<00:01:28.080> this<00:01:28.260> case<00:01:28.500> and<00:01:28.950> we<00:01:29.070> can<00:01:29.190> very<00:01:29.370> quickly

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:30.350 
in this case and we can very quickly

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:33.440 
in this case and we can very quickly
select<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:31.560> link<00:01:31.650> to<00:01:31.800> property<00:01:32.220> button<00:01:32.610> and

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
select the link to property button and

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.950 
select the link to property button and
instead<00:01:34.140> of<00:01:34.170> using<00:01:34.380> current<00:01:34.710> document

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:35.960 
instead of using current document

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.149 
instead of using current document
properties<00:01:36.960> we're<00:01:37.530> going<00:01:37.620> to<00:01:37.710> use<00:01:37.800> the<00:01:37.920> model

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
properties we're going to use the model

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.460 
properties we're going to use the model
properties<00:01:38.610> for<00:01:38.790> ddm<00:01:39.180> so<00:01:39.840> here's<00:01:40.050> our<00:01:40.200> list<00:01:40.350> of

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
properties for ddm so here's our list of

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.160 
properties for ddm so here's our list of
model<00:01:40.740> properties<00:01:41.100> in<00:01:41.220> ddm<00:01:41.810> and<00:01:42.810> all<00:01:42.930> we<00:01:43.020> need

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
model properties in ddm and all we need

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:49.760 
model properties in ddm and all we need
to<00:01:43.200> do<00:01:43.409> now<00:01:43.620> is<00:01:43.830> find<00:01:45.740> our<00:01:46.740> part<00:01:47.700> number<00:01:48.770> which

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
to do now is find our part number which

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.260 
to do now is find our part number which
is<00:01:49.979> there<00:01:52.250> okay<00:01:53.250> obviously<00:01:53.970> I've<00:01:54.030> added<00:01:54.150> the

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
excuse me will right click properties

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.570 
excuse me will right click properties
then<00:02:10.020> that<00:02:10.140> shows<00:02:10.350> us<00:02:10.530> the<00:02:10.679> text<00:02:11.130> or<00:02:11.310> the<00:02:11.370> note

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
then that shows us the text or the note

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:12.900 
then that shows us the text or the note
text<00:02:12.030> eight<00:02:12.150> so

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
text eight so

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.620 
text eight so
we<00:02:12.970> can<00:02:13.090> then<00:02:13.180> remove<00:02:13.330> the<00:02:15.150> first<00:02:16.150> portion<00:02:16.540> of

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630 
we can then remove the first portion of

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:19.500 
we can then remove the first portion of
that<00:02:16.780> so<00:02:17.080> we<00:02:17.110> showed<00:02:17.770> dollar<00:02:18.160> PR<00:02:18.550> sheet<00:02:18.820> part

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
that so we showed dollar PR sheet part

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
that so we showed dollar PR sheet part
number<00:02:21.810> okay<00:02:22.810> so<00:02:22.870> that's<00:02:23.110> now<00:02:23.260> been<00:02:23.350> converted

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
number okay so that's now been converted

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:27.780 
number okay so that's now been converted
onto<00:02:24.010> a<00:02:24.040> DDM<00:02:24.520> numbering<00:02:25.420> system<00:02:26.610> to<00:02:27.610> actually

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
onto a DDM numbering system to actually

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:30.420 
onto a DDM numbering system to actually
copy<00:02:28.240> its<00:02:29.170> kind<00:02:29.350> of<00:02:29.470> information<00:02:29.650> around

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
copy its kind of information around

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:33.030 
copy its kind of information around
perhaps<00:02:31.030> be<00:02:31.660> easier<00:02:31.870> to<00:02:31.930> probably<00:02:32.530> copy<00:02:32.860> this

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
perhaps be easier to probably copy this

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.340 
perhaps be easier to probably copy this
field<00:02:33.340> and<00:02:33.580> then<00:02:34.030> rename<00:02:34.540> it<00:02:34.720> with<00:02:35.020> it<00:02:35.200> with<00:02:35.320> a

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 
field and then rename it with it with a

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:37.050 
field and then rename it with it with a
different<00:02:35.740> feature<00:02:35.920> with<00:02:36.610> a<00:02:36.640> different

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
different feature with a different

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:38.880 
different feature with a different
attribute<00:02:37.210> so<00:02:37.900> in<00:02:38.080> this<00:02:38.170> case<00:02:38.380> what<00:02:38.620> we<00:02:38.710> could

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
attribute so in this case what we could

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:43.350 
attribute so in this case what we could
do<00:02:39.070> is<00:02:39.990> do<00:02:40.990> an<00:02:41.110> edit<00:02:41.260> copy<00:02:42.250> and<00:02:42.670> then<00:02:43.150> on<00:02:43.270> the

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
do is do an edit copy and then on the

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.810 
do is do an edit copy and then on the
drawing<00:02:43.570> oops<00:02:44.350> Cuse<00:02:44.620> me<00:02:44.650> and<00:02:44.980> do<00:02:45.250> a<00:02:45.280> ctrl<00:02:45.640> V

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:45.820 
drawing oops Cuse me and do a ctrl V

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:48.000 
drawing oops Cuse me and do a ctrl V
maybe<00:02:46.060> and<00:02:46.330> then<00:02:46.630> paste<00:02:46.960> on<00:02:47.230> that<00:02:47.770> same

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
maybe and then paste on that same

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:49.860 
maybe and then paste on that same
attributes<00:02:48.490> so<00:02:49.000> once<00:02:49.180> you've<00:02:49.300> lined<00:02:49.450> up<00:02:49.660> using

attributes so once you've lined up using
the<00:02:50.200> alignment<00:02:50.740> tools<00:02:51.420> you<00:02:52.420> could<00:02:52.600> then<00:02:52.630> right

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
the alignment tools you could then right

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:56.010 
the alignment tools you could then right
click<00:02:53.800> package<00:02:54.700> properties<00:02:55.210> we<00:02:55.630> can<00:02:55.780> see<00:02:55.900> it's

click package properties we can see it's

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:58.200 
click package properties we can see it's
part<00:02:56.290> number<00:02:56.350> so<00:02:57.100> let's<00:02:57.280> just<00:02:57.460> link<00:02:57.700> that<00:02:57.970> will

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:59.700 
part number so let's just link that will
delete<00:02:58.540> the<00:02:58.600> part<00:02:58.870> number<00:02:59.050> in<00:02:59.140> this<00:02:59.230> case<00:02:59.320> and

00:02:59.700 --> 00:02:59.710 
delete the part number in this case and

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:07.080

we're<00:03:07.240> done<00:03:08.370> another<00:03:09.370> way<00:03:09.460> of<00:03:09.490> creating<00:03:09.760> this

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
we're done another way of creating this

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.930 
we're done another way of creating this
piece<00:03:10.540> of<00:03:10.630> its<00:03:10.780> a<00:03:10.900> text<00:03:11.290> is<00:03:11.560> to<00:03:12.010> actually<00:03:12.190> works

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940 
piece of its a text is to actually works

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:18.360 
piece of its a text is to actually works
to<00:03:13.030> put<00:03:13.150> up<00:03:13.270> there<00:03:14.160> is<00:03:15.390> to<00:03:16.390> actually<00:03:17.370> create

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370 
to put up there is to actually create

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:20.250 
to put up there is to actually create
brand-new<00:03:18.700> pieces<00:03:19.000> of<00:03:19.240> text<00:03:19.480> so<00:03:19.810> if<00:03:19.930> I<00:03:20.020> wanted

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
brand-new pieces of text so if I wanted

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.290 
brand-new pieces of text so if I wanted
to<00:03:20.320> create<00:03:20.709> a<00:03:20.950> new<00:03:21.459> piece<00:03:21.580> of<00:03:21.700> text<00:03:21.970> we<00:03:22.090> go<00:03:22.240> to

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:22.300 
to create a new piece of text we go to

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:24.690 
to create a new piece of text we go to
the<00:03:22.450> annotations<00:03:22.990> area<00:03:23.380> which<00:03:24.130> select<00:03:24.430> note

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:24.700 
the annotations area which select note

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.720 
the annotations area which select note
and<00:03:25.060> then<00:03:25.480> we<00:03:25.540> just<00:03:25.570> place<00:03:25.900> down<00:03:26.200> our<00:03:26.440> new<00:03:27.430> note

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 
and then we just place down our new note

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:30.570 
and then we just place down our new note
institue<00:03:28.600> then<00:03:29.350> we'd<00:03:29.470> use<00:03:29.800> and<00:03:30.100> without

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:30.580 
institue then we'd use and without

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:33.150 
institue then we'd use and without
closing<00:03:30.910> that<00:03:31.180> area<00:03:31.600> we<00:03:32.260> would<00:03:32.410> then<00:03:32.620> use<00:03:32.920> the

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:33.160 
closing that area we would then use the

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.940 
closing that area we would then use the

the<00:04:40.020> first<00:04:40.230> thing<00:04:40.320> we're<00:04:40.590> going<00:04:40.680> to<00:04:40.740> do<00:04:40.920> is

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:41.690 
the first thing we're going to do is

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:49.700 
the first thing we're going to do is
delete<00:04:43.490> the<00:04:44.490> drawing<00:04:44.760> view<00:04:48.530> which<00:04:49.530> then

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:49.710 
delete the drawing view which then

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:50.930 
delete the drawing view which then
removes<00:04:50.070> all<00:04:50.220> the<00:04:50.280> attribute<00:04:50.820> information

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:50.940 
removes all the attribute information

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:53.390 
removes all the attribute information
and<00:04:51.600> then<00:04:52.230> the<00:04:52.290> second<00:04:52.620> thing<00:04:52.800> we<00:04:52.950> need<00:04:53.100> to<00:04:53.130> do

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:53.400 
and then the second thing we need to do

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:56.840 
and then the second thing we need to do
is<00:04:54.210> go<00:04:54.390> to<00:04:54.450> properties<00:04:55.370> then<00:04:56.370> go<00:04:56.520> to<00:04:56.580> custom

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:56.850 
is go to properties then go to custom

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:58.610 
is go to properties then go to custom
and<00:04:57.420> then<00:04:57.480> we<00:04:57.780> need<00:04:57.930> to<00:04:58.020> individually<00:04:58.290> delete

00:04:58.610 --> 00:04:58.620 
and then we need to individually delete

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:01.460 
and then we need to individually delete
every<00:04:59.250> one<00:04:59.400> of<00:04:59.520> these<00:04:59.640> attributes<00:05:00.570> to<00:05:01.200> clear

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:01.470 
every one of these attributes to clear

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:03.740

up any ddm information that's there you

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:05.540 
up any ddm information that's there you
could<00:05:03.900> also<00:05:04.020> add<00:05:04.260> hyphens<00:05:04.740> into<00:05:05.040> the<00:05:05.160> value<00:05:05.460> or

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:05.550 
could also add hyphens into the value or

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:17.579 
could also add hyphens into the value or
text<00:05:05.850> expression

00:05:17.579 --> 00:05:17.589

pin<00:05:57.680> we<00:05:57.800> were<00:05:57.979> we<00:05:58.339> had<00:05:58.399> in<00:05:58.580> session<00:05:58.849> a<00:05:58.879> minute

00:05:59.079 --> 00:05:59.089 
pin we were we had in session a minute

00:05:59.089 --> 00:06:01.510 
pin we were we had in session a minute
ago<00:05:59.210> let's<00:05:59.689> create<00:05:59.870> a<00:05:59.930> new<00:06:00.020> drawing<00:06:00.529> based<00:06:01.370> on

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:01.520 
ago let's create a new drawing based on

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:06.100 
ago let's create a new drawing based on
DD<00:06:01.819> ma<00:06:02.029> three<00:06:04.059> let's<00:06:05.059> add<00:06:05.300> that<00:06:05.569> drawing<00:06:05.870> on

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:06.110 
DD ma three let's add that drawing on

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:12.279 
DD ma three let's add that drawing on
there<00:06:06.550> and<00:06:10.180> as<00:06:11.180> you<00:06:11.389> can<00:06:11.509> see<00:06:11.539> the<00:06:11.809> drawing

00:06:12.279 --> 00:06:12.289 
there and as you can see the drawing

00:06:12.289 --> 00:06:14.409 
there and as you can see the drawing
board<00:06:12.589> has<00:06:12.710> already<00:06:12.860> starts<00:06:13.249> to<00:06:13.370> fit<00:06:13.580> in<00:06:13.699> and

00:06:14.409 --> 00:06:14.419 
board has already starts to fit in and

00:06:14.419 --> 00:06:19.239 
board has already starts to fit in and
then<00:06:15.050> we<00:06:15.110> can<00:06:15.289> do<00:06:15.439> a<00:06:15.469> DDM<00:06:16.009> save<00:06:17.979> get<00:06:18.979> a<00:06:19.009> new

00:06:19.239 --> 00:06:19.249 
then we can do a DDM save get a new

00:06:19.249 --> 00:06:37.230 
then we can do a DDM save get a new
number

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:37.240 

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:38.969 

and<00:06:37.810> there<00:06:37.960> we<00:06:38.050> have<00:06:38.080> it<00:06:38.199> we've<00:06:38.440> used<00:06:38.650> our<00:06:38.800> new

00:06:38.969 --> 00:06:38.979 
and there we have it we've used our new

00:06:38.979 --> 00:06:41.189 
and there we have it we've used our new
drawing<00:06:39.639> template<00:06:40.090> to<00:06:40.599> create<00:06:40.720> a<00:06:40.840> new<00:06:40.900> drawing

00:06:41.189 --> 00:06:41.199 
drawing template to create a new drawing

00:06:41.199 --> 00:06:43.620 
drawing template to create a new drawing
inside
