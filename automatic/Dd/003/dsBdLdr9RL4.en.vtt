00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:03.730
 or not 

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:14.840
 but it's something I had not seen yet 

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:17.300
 because of course as you know now in 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:19.130
 youtube is playing custom apps I have 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:22.570
 tried I like it a lot I hope clear 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:25.490
 be used to a play command and 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:27.470
 good or those of xbox be 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:30.349
 used to an xbox and then play the 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:33.789
 keyboard and mouse because it shows that it is 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:37.579
 a little then after being 

00:00:33.789 --> 00:00:39.980
 investigating different ways and everything 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:42.230
 there was a way that was with two 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:45.800
 programs one that is this that is the 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:47.870
 only one that we're going to use and the x for 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:50.989
 do a program that I do not know why in 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:53.540
 windows 8 did not work so I've 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:58.130
 discovered an easier way and 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:01:01.710
 simple to put the play control on 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:04.290
 45 or I think it could be that also in 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.409
 any other call of duty go but no 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.049
 he 

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:12.069
 to see apart from being a tutorial is a 

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:14.200
 video to warn that I will upload custom app 

00:01:12.069 --> 00:01:17.109
 surely but it's not cool either 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:20.380
 upload them when you alone so I already know 

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:21.640
 I'm installing a friend and how good 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:25.030
 ask me to install it too 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:28.359
 are installing so good let's start with 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:30.310
 the video tutorial first download the 

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:31.980
 motion yoyos leave the link in the 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:34.950
 description 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:37.490
 and you will be worth it, just open it up 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:40.290
 to all that yes because I would say to try 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:42.420
 encase no other program but 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:45.080
 be careful with that if you see that go 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:48.450
 little by little and check that you do not put 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:49.710
 accept terms of download and that 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.980
 any program that is not the one 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.650
 ye it then it will have what I 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:58.460
 I already have it 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:02:01.630
 and of course I have minimized value and you have 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:05.560
 that go to the driver manager here 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:07.659
 after this the selection isolated go 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.399
 here that seems to appear anti-crisis the 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:12.239
 drivers 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:12.239
 it will take me a little 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:21.250
 ok and here below it will come out to be 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:21.250
 completed then you give install 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:25.440
 and I already want 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:29.310
 It gives a lot of installation windows 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:31.830
 of hardware then to me it does not appear 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:34.500
 because I have it installed first of 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:36.960
 all try the vibrato testing and how 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:40.050
 you see me is vibrating if it vibrates is 

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:41.940
 that everything is fine then it will be in 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:44.370
 playstation 1 insurance play 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:46.140
 station2 I do not know but it will be in one 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.570
 of these because it will detect that it is 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:51.180
 playstation the command but you have to 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:55.430
 put it on xbox 360 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:03:00.210
 because in xbox 360 because very easy because 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:03.300
 with 5 for him because he is to put some 

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:07.020
 commands for you to go the command of 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:10.620
 xbox but as we have the 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:13.290
 play because with this program we cheat and 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:16.710
 we x6 is the Xbox to 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:20.180
 install it with it with the console in the 

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:23.359
 card 85 edward 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:24.870
 so a moment now we're going for 

00:03:23.359 --> 00:03:28.019
 the game 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:30.750
 ok we are already in the game and first of 

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:34.700
 all so that you go to console 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:34.700
 you go to options and controls 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:41.140
 to game options and the active one is the 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:43.180
 console give everything activated 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:46.270
 and it's worth once here it has to be in 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:49.270
 this menu there is a button that is next 

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:52.750
 of number one and above the tab key 

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:54.600
 of the arrows you are clicking and you 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:57.209
 this will appear this is the console 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:04:00.340
 then to install the play command 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:03.890
 you have to put 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:06.340
 running the performer that is run 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:08.380
 in English as shit is said 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:13.140
 of faul 

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:13.140
 low bar controller 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:25.449
 point c efe g once this you give him enter 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:29.080
 leave that maybe to the key to which 

00:04:25.449 --> 00:04:30.639
 you have given to him for you already know so that 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:33.180
 exit the console you go to options and 

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:36.520
 controls 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:38.050
 controls here I did not find it you go 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:40.509
 to movement and tips that you have to see 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:42.759
 that some will leave the lyrics of these 

00:04:40.509 --> 00:04:44.610
 colors and leaves letters of these from 

00:04:42.759 --> 00:04:47.750
 colors 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:50.260
 that you have done well 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:53.110
 so 

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:56.440
 once once the keys come out 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:58.150
 you are for example reloading weapon I 

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:59.890
 will give square because they are the same 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:02.710
 controls but you see that a key will come out 

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:06.870
 that's not that's because the square 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:06.870
 is equivalent to the x key on the xbox control 

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:12.080
 is to paint the same and good with everything 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:13.940
 I and I 'll do that because when I install it 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:15.630
 again the controls then return to 

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:20.400
 predetermined 

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:23.100
 and see you will see that the sensitivity is very 

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:25.860
 very slow and that raising sensitivity 

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:28.200
 It does not work and that is because as you are with 

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:31.310
 that we are with the command we have to 

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:31.310
 put time 

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:36.860
 work 

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:36.860
 all right 

00:05:37.449 --> 00:05:41.240
 continued 

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:44.240
 sensi 

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:44.240
 sensitivity 

00:05:46.639 --> 00:05:51.020
 I think I have pointed because they are things 

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:53.300
 that later I do not remember and from 

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:55.610
 here we will put a number the number that 

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:58.759
 you will be a number one but there it is 

00:05:55.610 --> 00:06:00.319
 the number five with which the numbers 

00:05:58.759 --> 00:06:02.569
 they do not equal for example one of the 

00:06:00.319 --> 00:06:05.229
 white plus and the numbers two I'm going to 

00:06:02.569 --> 00:06:08.870
 compare with those of black ops 2 to see a 

00:06:05.229 --> 00:06:12.590
 2.5 that would be worth a number 7 number 8 

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:16.280
 the 2 would equal number 4 number 5 as well 

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:19.700
 that I will put 2.5 

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:22.400
 and now it will be after 

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:24.320
 configure it the buttons as we want and 

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:27.639
 to look at what is your shenzhou 

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:30.650
 your voice your sensitivity 

00:06:27.639 --> 00:06:32.780
 favorite since you will have it this is 

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:36.340
 all bye by nike subscribe if you do not 

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:36.340
 you are and even another
