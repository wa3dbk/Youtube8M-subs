00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:30.390
 you could assemble it's people 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.649
 guns because the choir cutie is mike ben 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.629

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:37.019

00:00:37.019 --> 00:00:40.440
 combination but that is not right 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.879
 place we are at least i play you 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.159
 with the sniper as you can see 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.720
 and that has been feeling pretty good lately 

00:00:44.159 --> 00:00:48.059
 I play with it but I play the 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:49.140
 not much more call or lately 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.449
 duty 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.579
 this is the reason that I am particularly busy now 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.660
 am with jiji Xpadder fire you if 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.100
 don't know yet 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.050
 link is in the description to the 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.329
 video of the trailer I'm working on 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.679
 I probably have you 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.399
 all see eyes but that doesn't matter 

00:01:01.679 --> 00:01:03.960
 from 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.119
 sorry roof not uploaded for a while 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.009
 I was supposed to have this video 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.960
 actually already came out on Saturday but then 

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:13.679
 I had something clear how what to 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:15.600
 so yes this was just leaving 

00:01:13.679 --> 00:01:16.979
 at least i now saw the time to get one 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.230
 commentary and it was beautiful 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.440
 is still outside and 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:23.930
 naja team lanterns so your arm either 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:26.210
 but yes it has been a while 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:27.800
 I will post you my theory 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:28.580
 done to usually do i am live 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.470
 commentary 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:33.410
 nowadays yes what are live comments 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:35.690
 is that is just that I spell and talk 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:37.880
 at the same time and this is actually me 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:40.070
 got here last time and now i put myself 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.780
 to face with a facecam and then I talk 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:44.150
 actually over it 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:45.290
 And yes that is something that I am true to 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:48.560
 I started with it 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:51.650
 finally true year live commentary 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:53.420
 I think sop it up 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:55.580
 more convenient to do and more fun to do 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.420
 do because what more is my response 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:58.970
 ready 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:01.310
 the game because yes now I can of course 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:03.560
 not going to imitate what I was then 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:06.890
 thought what i did then i go by the way 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:10.160
 28 at two three I think I don't know 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:12.110
 What was the make 4 to me 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.670
 the gameplay and of course, as far 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:15.980
 short for my subject and then 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.720
 I will of course extend this 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.030
 every case 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:22.270
 yes i'm a little bit lately 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:24.800
 been busy with the Jiji x 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:26.660
 battlegrounds and yes I am one of them 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:29.000
 so the game was all about arranging and 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:30.680
 takes care of the server and things like that 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.080
 and of course there will soon be the 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:36.200
 dutch youtube gathering eh so the dutch 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:38.000
 youtube gathering 8 this time and well 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:40.430
 if you want to go there you can 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.250
 you have to hurry because there are now 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:45.380
 fewer than 106 tickets at the moment 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:47.740
 I still happen to know about that 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:49.720
 because I'm in it myself 

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:51.850
 I am a volunteer I will run 4 pi 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:53.500
 but wants a signature or wants 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:55.600
 you in the picture with me or whatever or 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:58.090
 do you want to do your seat with me or do you want 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:59.020
 together to the mac about whatever you like 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:00.760
 want 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:02.770
 yes that can go and of course 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:04.090
 then you can meet me with my chair 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:06.970
 if you want 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:07.960
 Sat my find kid you must do 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:11.800
 nowadays i also have one 

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:13.750
 upload schedule as a schedule but each 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:15.330
 case it's something i'm going to do 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:18.520
 keep the idea is that I now 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:21.310
 a video at least every four days 

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:22.900
 upload that is my intention that I can 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:24.520
 of course not keeping up but it is 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.080
 at least a week as always then 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:28.060
 actually they have been one every week 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:30.190
 video anyway but the intention is 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:32.260
 that I now every four days so as me 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:35.830
 if you see three days then i will go one tomorrow 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:37.000
 upload video and then you get something 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:38.440
 more content for me and what 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.630
 different content because I have 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:42.520
 of course now also run multiple series 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:44.830
 I now have the Pokémon series Pokémon and 

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:46.260
 gray walk together with don or he 

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:48.580
 loses 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:51.040
 In addition, I have the series for the front 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:53.860
 also commit co-op with dill with lucas and 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:57.640
 with seleste and then I have dual 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:59.080
 survival demolish with everyone and yes that 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:00.940
 are the three series that I put on 

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:02.709
 this moment and then of course I have this one 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:04.720
 comment is still that always remain 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:06.760
 because I started with this and 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:08.260
 probably i will just put this in until 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:09.280
 keep doing it in the times as long as I do it 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.470
 like it 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:13.269
 but yes you may still have 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:15.400
 ideas for 

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:16.900
 commentary of one and my game what i 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.760
 will have to do a series that i 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:21.790
 gotta do something or something you 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:23.440
 would find fun and what I think 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:24.190
 hey that seems nice to me too 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:25.630
 to do 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:27.160
 then put it in a comment here 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:28.870
 below is also stated 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:30.550
 title nowadays everything is under 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:31.990
 nothing more above I do not know 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:34.479
 why i didn't point my down but 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:36.430
 everything is, among other things, the case 

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:38.890
 yes you want to see something of my own or 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:40.690
 series what your nice line just puts that 

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:44.770
 just put in the comments that I can or 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:46.030
 responses because I am the Netherlands then will 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:46.750
 I look at that and then look 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:48.340
 from hey 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:52.020
 I think that might also be fun myself 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:52.020
 I do and then you are lucky again 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:55.360
 yes you actually want me to 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:56.009
 post commentaries of this kind 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:58.469
 to do 

00:04:56.009 --> 00:05:00.029
 of course I have been doing this since the beginning 

00:04:58.469 --> 00:05:03.509
 but maybe you find yourself too 

00:05:00.029 --> 00:05:04.860
 live commentary fabric what fun and yes then 

00:05:03.509 --> 00:05:06.389
 of course you can also just do that in the 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:09.149
 put comments if you really like that 

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:12.949
 I like it because yes I like it myself 

00:05:09.149 --> 00:05:15.180
 a bit nicer but yes to loco beauty 

00:05:12.949 --> 00:05:16.979
 To do life commentaries is that anyway 

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:18.869
 a bit different for me because 

00:05:16.979 --> 00:05:22.050
 I am not used to that I am so 

00:05:18.869 --> 00:05:23.819
 strange and yes that will not be very bad 

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:26.759
 say say it would be different 

00:05:23.819 --> 00:05:28.499
 games or say yes only call of duty 

00:05:26.759 --> 00:05:30.210
 but pose is commentaire or other games 

00:05:28.499 --> 00:05:32.249
 I also got angry at the elysis once 

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:35.759
 I have done that strangely 

00:05:32.249 --> 00:05:37.379
 once powdered there is slightly less case 

00:05:35.759 --> 00:05:41.210
 yes the difference is that it is live 

00:05:37.379 --> 00:05:44.249
 and that it is otherwise an a and yes 

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:45.930
 there is not much difference for me 

00:05:44.249 --> 00:05:47.939
 maybe it's nicer to be for 

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:49.529
 you watch so well bet it 

00:05:47.939 --> 00:05:52.729
 the comments and I will look at the 

00:05:49.529 --> 00:05:56.339
 maybe you will see the result 

00:05:52.729 --> 00:05:59.819
 the result will come but yes that 

00:05:56.339 --> 00:06:02.039
 depends on your voice because yes I think 

00:05:59.819 --> 00:06:03.809
 these videos just made fun 

00:06:02.039 --> 00:06:05.249
 just fun to do it doesn't matter 

00:06:03.809 --> 00:06:07.009
 which way i just like it 

00:06:05.249 --> 00:06:10.589
 create and edit videos 

00:06:07.009 --> 00:06:14.309
 and not so much for what I do, but everyone 

00:06:10.589 --> 00:06:16.499
 In case I will give tips and next time 

00:06:14.309 --> 00:06:18.389
 upload tricks and I pull tips and 

00:06:16.499 --> 00:06:20.610
 tricks video and then I see you in the 

00:06:18.389 --> 00:06:24.379
 next kemp commentary i am anne 

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:24.379
 wind and I say see ash
