00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:22.320
 yes all these leaders how are you 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.970
 but listen to me it's going great 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.859
 so today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.029
 new video a little lot a little 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.949
 tutorial as you could see in the 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.720
 title so it's simple it's 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.540
 how this pony in an organic but that one 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:36.329
 1.7.2 so I know that quite a lot of 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.590
 you and me me first I always 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.190
 tried to look for a bios but that I 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.660
 never found 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.850
 so that's why today 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.149
 I present a small video for 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.230
 just found this bio but that 

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:47.899
 directly finally actually I you 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.640
 gave a site that will allow you to 

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:53.930
 spawn and in a bio but that's for 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:57.629
 that you go in the multiplayer 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:58.710
 then direct connect it's not that ah 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.910
 no it's not that I 'm sorry 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.500
 deceived I transmit myself in giant I 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.019
 shit it's a single 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.299
 player so you created new world 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:09.210
 you will call it as you want I 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.500
 will call him but his game mode will 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.040
 put in what you want me I 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:17.340
 creative food then you click 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:19.619
 more option dead or optional click 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.130
 above and here you go back the site 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.890
 map 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:25.480
 so the site is the map number 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.070
 on which you are going this pony and 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:29.320
 and here I am I make you this pony on 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:31.600
 a block but that's it and then 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:33.250
 you change to nothing unless you 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.600
 put them tuitou parents you do this 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:37.810
 that you want then I do you 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:39.490
 give and crack new world and that's it 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:42.580
 do you gonna make that pony on a 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.690
 bios but that's so simple they 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:47.020
 are really very complicated to find 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:48.430
 one that are very rare and so I have 2 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.950
 which makes it possible to fall on 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:53.710
 and so here it is it is a very beautiful 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:56.710
 spawn these practices because there are some 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:59.140
 arts right next door and at the same time 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:00.550
 So you can take wood from 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.010
 you settle in and then right after you 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:03.820
 have a bios but that's it's you 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:05.500
 do as you wish you 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:06.250
 do not install here you do like you 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.540
 I do not care 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:09.820
 but that's me it was just for 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:11.940
 represent the bio but that's so you 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:13.980
 see it all 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.460
 the key in laye c is our club 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.890
 Ardennes 

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:20.630
 so this is it finally it's really 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.790
 a bios conducted here normal and more 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:24.470
 a little the kippah which is nice enough 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:27.130
 frankly so here I find that 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:30.040
 it's really a good side and 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:33.460
 he stretches losing those times no more 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:36.130
 far I think in games even up m 

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:38.320
 1,16 schenk to see further 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:40.450
 I do not know if it's a way it's in 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:42.640
 guard and how beautiful it is 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:45.010
 and it's more of a super big fringe 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.280
 mancelle power well benefited and so 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:47.710
 here 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.360
 on this the sinister has in the description 

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:52.620
 you have just in the fall the rise 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:54.790
 when running the are they at 4000 it's 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.560
 saw you back in the sitdom I 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:58.030
 wanted to say and so here is so on this 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:59.140
 month I tell you has been more leader to 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:01.440
