00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
put in a light that will represent the

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.070 
put in a light that will represent the
Sun<00:00:14.160> in<00:00:14.400> our<00:00:14.490> level<00:00:14.849> which<00:00:15.089> is<00:00:15.269> actually<00:00:15.780> why<00:00:16.049> I

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
Sun in our level which is actually why I

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.670 
Sun in our level which is actually why I
put<00:00:16.680> the<00:00:17.279> Sky<00:00:17.670> box<00:00:17.880> in<00:00:18.150> first<00:00:18.480> a<00:00:18.720> lot<00:00:19.350> of<00:00:19.500> sky

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
put the Sky box in first a lot of sky

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.250 
put the Sky box in first a lot of sky
boxes<00:00:20.160> will<00:00:20.369> have<00:00:20.550> some<00:00:20.970> part<00:00:21.600> of<00:00:21.750> the<00:00:21.900> texture

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
boxes will have some part of the texture

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:23.900 
boxes will have some part of the texture
which<00:00:22.470> looks<00:00:22.769> like<00:00:22.949> a<00:00:22.980> Sun<00:00:23.279> or<00:00:23.580> it<00:00:23.730> looks<00:00:23.850> like

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
which looks like a Sun or it looks like

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.429 
which looks like a Sun or it looks like
a<00:00:24.029> brighter<00:00:24.300> area<00:00:24.689> where<00:00:24.840> a<00:00:24.869> Sun<00:00:25.140> should<00:00:25.380> be

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
a brighter area where a Sun should be

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.200 
a brighter area where a Sun should be
and<00:00:25.769> it's<00:00:26.189> nice<00:00:26.400> to<00:00:26.430> already<00:00:26.849> have<00:00:26.970> that<00:00:27.119> in

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
and it's nice to already have that in

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:28.220 
and it's nice to already have that in
place<00:00:27.390> because<00:00:27.539> it<00:00:27.720> can<00:00:27.840> help<00:00:28.019> you<00:00:28.199> with

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
place because it can help you with

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.830 
place because it can help you with
proper<00:00:28.740> positioning<00:00:29.340> and<00:00:29.550> angling<00:00:30.240> of<00:00:30.390> your

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
proper positioning and angling of your

sunlight now we already have a work
light<00:00:32.910> in<00:00:33.120> place<00:00:33.390> just<00:00:33.660> a<00:00:34.020> basic<00:00:34.620> directional

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
light in place just a basic directional

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.950 
light in place just a basic directional
light<00:00:35.309> instead<00:00:36.239> of<00:00:36.329> getting<00:00:36.540> rid<00:00:36.690> of<00:00:36.750> that

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
light instead of getting rid of that

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.720 
light instead of getting rid of that
replacing<00:00:37.500> it<00:00:37.590> with<00:00:37.680> a<00:00:37.710> Sun<00:00:37.920> light<00:00:38.100> we're<00:00:38.489> just

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
replacing it with a Sun light we're just

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.420 
replacing it with a Sun light we're just
going<00:00:38.910> to<00:00:38.969> promote<00:00:39.719> that<00:00:40.079> light<00:00:40.410> to<00:00:40.800> our<00:00:41.010> Sun

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
going to promote that light to our Sun

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.130 
going to promote that light to our Sun
I'm<00:00:41.700> going<00:00:41.850> to<00:00:41.910> give<00:00:42.000> it<00:00:42.059> a<00:00:42.090> promotion<00:00:42.239> I'm

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
I'm going to give it a promotion I'm

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.660 
I'm going to give it a promotion I'm
going<00:00:43.290> to<00:00:43.350> do<00:00:43.469> that<00:00:43.620> in<00:00:44.160> a<00:00:44.280> couple<00:00:44.430> of<00:00:44.579> ways

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
going to do that in a couple of ways

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.270 
going to do that in a couple of ways
first<00:00:44.969> we're<00:00:45.210> going<00:00:45.420> to<00:00:45.539> change<00:00:46.289> its<00:00:46.559> name<00:00:46.890> so

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
first we're going to change its name so

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.650 
first we're going to change its name so
I'm<00:00:47.789> going<00:00:47.910> to<00:00:47.940> come<00:00:48.120> over<00:00:48.180> here<00:00:48.390> and<00:00:48.450> select

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
I'm going to come over here and select

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.900 
I'm going to come over here and select
directional<00:00:49.500> light<00:00:49.680> and<00:00:49.920> if<00:00:50.309> I<00:00:50.399> click<00:00:50.670> on<00:00:50.760> it

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
directional light and if I click on it

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.660 
directional light and if I click on it
again<00:00:50.969> we<00:00:51.449> can<00:00:51.690> change<00:00:52.050> the<00:00:52.260> name<00:00:52.410> to<00:00:53.510> sunlight

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:55.670 
again we can change the name to sunlight

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:57.799 
again we can change the name to sunlight
that'll<00:00:56.670> work<00:00:56.820> and<00:00:56.969> there's<00:00:57.270> another<00:00:57.539> way

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
that'll work and there's another way

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.090 
that'll work and there's another way
that<00:00:57.840> you<00:00:58.079> could<00:00:58.260> rename<00:00:58.590> it<00:00:59.510> Li<00:01:00.510> f2<00:01:01.260> okay

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
that you could rename it Li f2 okay

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.910 
that you could rename it Li f2 okay
yes<00:01:03.090> we<00:01:03.270> hit<00:01:03.449> it<00:01:03.600> we're<00:01:03.899> going<00:01:04.049> to<00:01:04.140> hit<00:01:04.229> f2<00:01:04.680> with

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
yes we hit it we're going to hit f2 with

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.350 
yes we hit it we're going to hit f2 with
anything<00:01:05.220> we<00:01:05.309> select<00:01:05.610> over<00:01:05.790> here<00:01:05.909> just<00:01:06.090> tap

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
anything we select over here just tap

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.090 
anything we select over here just tap
the<00:01:06.510> f2<00:01:06.810> button<00:01:06.840> and<00:01:07.260> then<00:01:07.650> we<00:01:07.710> can<00:01:07.830> rename<00:01:08.040> it

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
the f2 button and then we can rename it

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.140 
the f2 button and then we can rename it
Sun<00:01:08.580> light<00:01:08.760> will<00:01:08.909> work<00:01:08.939> though<00:01:09.920> now<00:01:10.920> if<00:01:11.880> we

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
Sun light will work though now if we

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.210 
Sun light will work though now if we
take<00:01:12.360> a<00:01:12.420> look<00:01:12.659> at<00:01:12.810> our<00:01:13.110> sky<00:01:13.409> box<00:01:13.650> as<00:01:13.830> I<00:01:13.920> pointed

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
take a look at our sky box as I pointed

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.700 
take a look at our sky box as I pointed
out<00:01:14.310> earlier<00:01:14.490> there<00:01:15.060> is<00:01:15.119> a<00:01:15.720> brightened

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
out earlier there is a brightened

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.320 
out earlier there is a brightened
section<00:01:17.310> that<00:01:17.460> kind<00:01:17.670> of<00:01:17.729> looks<00:01:17.880> like<00:01:17.909> a<00:01:18.030> Sun

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
section that kind of looks like a Sun

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.890 
section that kind of looks like a Sun
and<00:01:18.570> what<00:01:19.560> I<00:01:19.619> want<00:01:19.770> to<00:01:19.830> do<00:01:20.070> is<00:01:20.479> move<00:01:21.479> the<00:01:21.720> light

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
and what I want to do is move the light

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.120 
and what I want to do is move the light
I'm<00:01:22.259> going<00:01:22.350> to<00:01:22.439> get<00:01:22.530> it<00:01:22.619> up<00:01:22.680> off<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:22.950> ground

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
I'm going to get it up off the ground

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.190 
I'm going to get it up off the ground
but<00:01:23.369> I<00:01:23.430> do<00:01:23.520> want<00:01:23.790> to<00:01:23.850> mention<00:01:24.180> because<00:01:24.570> this<00:01:25.080> is

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
but I do want to mention because this is

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.719 
but I do want to mention because this is
a<00:01:25.229> directional<00:01:25.770> light<00:01:25.920> and<00:01:26.189> because<00:01:26.700> a

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
a directional light and because a

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.730 
a directional light and because a
directional<00:01:27.299> light<00:01:27.479> simulates<00:01:28.290> a<00:01:28.470> light

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
directional light simulates a light

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.550 
directional light simulates a light
source<00:01:28.950> that<00:01:29.070> is<00:01:29.340> infinitely<00:01:30.090> far<00:01:30.390> away<00:01:30.600> the

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
source that is infinitely far away the

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:32.690 
source that is infinitely far away the
position<00:01:31.950> of<00:01:32.040> this<00:01:32.159> light<00:01:32.310> is<00:01:32.430> completely

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
position of this light is completely

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.490 
position of this light is completely
irrelevant<00:01:33.150> you<00:01:33.840> won't<00:01:34.020> be<00:01:34.079> able<00:01:34.140> to<00:01:34.290> tell

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
irrelevant you won't be able to tell

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.069 
irrelevant you won't be able to tell
where<00:01:34.829> you<00:01:34.979> move<00:01:35.130> it<00:01:35.280> to<00:01:35.310> but<00:01:36.299> I<00:01:36.479> just<00:01:36.689> find

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
where you move it to but I just find

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.590 
where you move it to but I just find
generally<00:01:37.799> that's<00:01:38.159> you<00:01:38.579> know<00:01:38.729> if<00:01:38.880> I'm<00:01:39.060> working

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
generally that's you know if I'm working

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.510 
generally that's you know if I'm working
on<00:01:39.659> a<00:01:39.720> level<00:01:39.990> I<00:01:40.229> usually<00:01:40.650> expect<00:01:40.920> to<00:01:41.159> find<00:01:41.340> the

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
on a level I usually expect to find the

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.420 
on a level I usually expect to find the
Sun<00:01:41.759> up<00:01:42.000> above<00:01:42.240> the<00:01:42.479> level<00:01:42.720> somewhere<00:01:43.340> at<00:01:44.340> the

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
Sun up above the level somewhere at the

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.520 
Sun up above the level somewhere at the
same<00:01:44.610> time<00:01:44.850> we<00:01:45.299> are<00:01:45.329> going<00:01:45.780> to<00:01:45.990> be<00:01:46.079> putting<00:01:46.350> a

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
same time we are going to be putting a

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.280 
same time we are going to be putting a
lens<00:01:46.950> flare<00:01:47.280> onto<00:01:48.030> this<00:01:48.210> Sun<00:01:48.540> now

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
lens flare onto this Sun now

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.010 
lens flare onto this Sun now
I'm<00:01:49.380> not<00:01:49.979> opening<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:50.670> floor<00:01:51.000> for<00:01:51.390> arguments

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
I'm not opening the floor for arguments

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.330 
I'm not opening the floor for arguments
as<00:01:52.140> to<00:01:52.170> whether<00:01:52.470> or<00:01:52.680> not<00:01:52.770> you<00:01:53.009> should<00:01:53.040> have<00:01:53.310> a

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
as to whether or not you should have a

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.789 
as to whether or not you should have a
lens<00:01:53.640> flare<00:01:53.909> on<00:01:54.210> a<00:01:54.240> cloudy<00:01:54.630> level<00:01:55.110> we're<00:01:55.680> not

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
lens flare on a cloudy level we're not

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.350 
lens flare on a cloudy level we're not
discussing<00:01:56.009> that<00:01:56.310> but<00:01:56.610> it's<00:01:56.729> your<00:01:56.850> first<00:01:56.969> game

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
discussing that but it's your first game

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.480 
discussing that but it's your first game
so<00:01:57.719> all<00:01:58.110> first<00:01:58.530> games<00:01:58.740> have<00:01:58.979> to<00:01:59.100> have<00:01:59.189> a<00:01:59.250> lens

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
so all first games have to have a lens

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.490 
so all first games have to have a lens
part<00:01:59.729> yeah<00:02:00.030> really<00:02:00.540> and<00:02:00.750> as<00:02:00.960> many<00:02:01.170> as<00:02:01.290> you<00:02:01.380> can

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
part yeah really and as many as you can

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.050 
part yeah really and as many as you can
get<00:02:01.680> really<00:02:01.950> so<00:02:02.250> I<00:02:02.280> mean<00:02:02.430> if<00:02:02.520> you<00:02:02.610> can<00:02:02.759> think<00:02:02.939> of

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
get really so I mean if you can think of

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.850 
get really so I mean if you can think of
other<00:02:03.180> places<00:02:03.479> to<00:02:03.810> cram<00:02:04.049> as<00:02:04.200> many<00:02:04.320> lens<00:02:04.590> flares

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
other places to cram as many lens flares

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.429 
other places to cram as many lens flares
of<00:02:05.280> course<00:02:05.490> I'm<00:02:05.640> kidding<00:02:05.990> one<00:02:06.990> is<00:02:07.170> more<00:02:07.409> than

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
of course I'm kidding one is more than

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.050 
of course I'm kidding one is more than
enough<00:02:07.770> I<00:02:08.099> just<00:02:08.129> wanted<00:02:08.429> to<00:02:08.520> show<00:02:08.670> how<00:02:08.819> to<00:02:08.879> add

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
enough I just wanted to show how to add

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.410 
enough I just wanted to show how to add
them<00:02:09.300> in<00:02:09.420> so<00:02:09.860> anyways<00:02:11.030> since<00:02:12.030> we're<00:02:12.270> going<00:02:12.360> to

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
them in so anyways since we're going to

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.850 
them in so anyways since we're going to
be<00:02:12.480> putting<00:02:12.690> on<00:02:12.810> a<00:02:12.840> lens<00:02:13.080> flare<00:02:13.290> we

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
be putting on a lens flare we

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.490 
be putting on a lens flare we
make<00:02:14.070> sure<00:02:14.220> that<00:02:14.370> the<00:02:14.520> Sun<00:02:14.850> is<00:02:15.090> really<00:02:15.960> high<00:02:16.470> up

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
make sure that the Sun is really high up

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.710 
make sure that the Sun is really high up
in<00:02:16.800> the<00:02:16.830> sky<00:02:17.010> even<00:02:17.970> though<00:02:18.240> the<00:02:18.360> position

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
in the sky even though the position

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.240 
in the sky even though the position
doesn't<00:02:18.840> matter<00:02:19.110> in<00:02:19.290> terms<00:02:19.320> of<00:02:19.710> lighting<00:02:19.980> if

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
doesn't matter in terms of lighting if

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.310 
doesn't matter in terms of lighting if
the<00:02:20.370> Sun<00:02:20.580> is<00:02:20.700> too<00:02:20.730> close<00:02:21.120> will<00:02:21.480> actually<00:02:21.900> see

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320 
the Sun is too close will actually see

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.950 
the Sun is too close will actually see
ourselves<00:02:22.740> moving<00:02:23.730> relative<00:02:24.450> to<00:02:24.630> the<00:02:24.750> sun's

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:24.960 
ourselves moving relative to the sun's

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:26.810 
ourselves moving relative to the sun's
position<00:02:25.200> I<00:02:25.620> mean<00:02:25.770> this<00:02:25.890> target<00:02:26.250> the<00:02:26.370> parallax

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:26.820 
position I mean this target the parallax

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:28.910 
position I mean this target the parallax
are<00:02:27.060> exactly<00:02:27.720> exactly<00:02:28.260> its<00:02:28.380> it<00:02:28.590> looked<00:02:28.800> like

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
are exactly exactly its it looked like

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.620 
are exactly exactly its it looked like
the<00:02:29.070> Sun<00:02:29.310> was<00:02:29.520> maybe<00:02:29.760> only<00:02:29.850> a<00:02:30.090> hundred<00:02:30.450> feet<00:02:30.600> in

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
the Sun was maybe only a hundred feet in

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.210 
the Sun was maybe only a hundred feet in
the<00:02:30.810> air<00:02:30.990> and<00:02:31.290> that's<00:02:31.410> no<00:02:31.800> good

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
the air and that's no good

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.070 
the air and that's no good
so<00:02:32.730> to<00:02:32.880> solve<00:02:33.090> that<00:02:33.300> problem<00:02:33.360> what<00:02:33.990> we're

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
so to solve that problem what we're

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.260 
so to solve that problem what we're
going<00:02:34.200> to<00:02:34.230> do<00:02:34.320> is<00:02:34.580> get<00:02:35.580> kind<00:02:35.790> of<00:02:35.850> an<00:02:35.940> idea<00:02:36.210> of

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 
going to do is get kind of an idea of

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:38.290 
going to do is get kind of an idea of
where<00:02:36.450> that<00:02:36.600> bright<00:02:36.870> spot<00:02:37.020> in<00:02:37.290> the<00:02:37.350> sky<00:02:37.560> is

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:38.300 
where that bright spot in the sky is

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.240 
where that bright spot in the sky is
I'll<00:02:39.300> rotate<00:02:39.690> so<00:02:39.840> it's<00:02:39.959> kind<00:02:40.140> of<00:02:40.200> up<00:02:40.440> in<00:02:40.860> to<00:02:41.130> the

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
I'll rotate so it's kind of up in to the

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:42.890 
I'll rotate so it's kind of up in to the
left<00:02:41.580> of<00:02:41.790> me<00:02:41.970> and<00:02:42.000> I'm<00:02:42.180> just<00:02:42.300> going<00:02:42.420> to<00:02:42.450> drag

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
left of me and I'm just going to drag

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.970 
left of me and I'm just going to drag
the<00:02:43.200> light<00:02:43.760> way<00:02:44.760> up<00:02:44.940> here<00:02:45.150> in<00:02:45.240> the<00:02:45.300> air<00:02:45.980> now

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
the light way up here in the air now

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.470 
the light way up here in the air now
we're<00:02:47.160> zoomed<00:02:47.459> so<00:02:47.760> far<00:02:48.060> away<00:02:48.180> right<00:02:48.450> now

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
we're zoomed so far away right now

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.240 
we're zoomed so far away right now
that's<00:02:48.840> that's<00:02:49.170> actually<00:02:49.560> considerable

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
that's that's actually considerable

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.550 
that's that's actually considerable
distance<00:02:50.760> I'm<00:02:51.480> going<00:02:51.630> to<00:02:51.690> rotate<00:02:52.020> underneath

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
distance I'm going to rotate underneath

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.540 
distance I'm going to rotate underneath
our<00:02:53.130> world<00:02:53.930> I'm<00:02:54.930> going<00:02:55.170> to<00:02:55.230> put<00:02:55.530> the<00:02:55.950> map<00:02:56.220> I'm

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
our world I'm going to put the map I'm

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:57.650 
our world I'm going to put the map I'm
going<00:02:56.580> to<00:02:56.730> position<00:02:56.850> the<00:02:57.120> map<00:02:57.270> so<00:02:57.450> that<00:02:57.480> it's

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
going to position the map so that it's

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.300 
going to position the map so that it's
right<00:02:57.870> in<00:02:58.110> the<00:02:58.230> center<00:02:58.260> of<00:02:58.620> the<00:02:58.800> bright<00:02:59.040> spot

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
right in the center of the bright spot

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.670 
right in the center of the bright spot
in<00:02:59.459> the<00:02:59.550> sky<00:02:59.820> and<00:03:00.060> then<00:03:00.660> I<00:03:00.900> will<00:03:01.080> move<00:03:01.440> the

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
in the sky and then I will move the

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.020 
in the sky and then I will move the
light<00:03:01.890> right<00:03:02.340> into<00:03:02.550> the<00:03:02.640> center<00:03:02.880> of<00:03:02.940> that

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
light right into the center of that

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.320 
light right into the center of that
bright<00:03:03.270> spot<00:03:03.650> then<00:03:04.650> I'll<00:03:04.980> tap<00:03:05.520> the<00:03:05.700> e<00:03:05.730> key<00:03:06.180> and

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
bright spot then I'll tap the e key and

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:07.970 
bright spot then I'll tap the e key and
that's<00:03:06.450> going<00:03:06.570> to<00:03:06.630> get<00:03:06.780> my<00:03:06.989> rotation<00:03:07.620> gizmo

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
that's going to get my rotation gizmo

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.610 
that's going to get my rotation gizmo
out<00:03:08.010> and<00:03:08.400> I'll<00:03:09.030> just<00:03:09.060> rotate<00:03:09.780> the<00:03:09.989> light<00:03:10.170> so

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
out and I'll just rotate the light so

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.260 
out and I'll just rotate the light so
it's<00:03:10.800> pointing<00:03:11.190> straight<00:03:11.489> back<00:03:11.760> at<00:03:12.000> us<00:03:12.150> and

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:12.270 
it's pointing straight back at us and

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:14.000 
it's pointing straight back at us and
that<00:03:12.660> should<00:03:12.930> give<00:03:13.080> us<00:03:13.110> a<00:03:13.260> really<00:03:13.680> close

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
that should give us a really close

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.750 
that should give us a really close
approximation<00:03:14.640> of<00:03:14.970> where<00:03:15.810> the<00:03:16.020> Sun<00:03:16.260> would<00:03:16.440> be

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.760 
approximation of where the Sun would be

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.930 
approximation of where the Sun would be
relative<00:03:17.760> to<00:03:17.790> this<00:03:18.060> particular<00:03:18.660> Sky<00:03:18.900> box<00:03:19.110> and

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940 
relative to this particular Sky box and

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:23.840 
relative to this particular Sky box and
that's<00:03:20.940> all<00:03:21.090> there<00:03:21.239> is<00:03:21.269> to<00:03:21.570> that<00:03:21.840> now<00:03:22.850> even

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:23.850 
that's all there is to that now even

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:26.449 
that's all there is to that now even
though<00:03:24.239> it<00:03:24.480> is<00:03:24.570> an<00:03:24.690> overcast<00:03:25.170> day<00:03:25.350> I<00:03:25.739> feel<00:03:26.280> like

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
though it is an overcast day I feel like

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:28.340 
though it is an overcast day I feel like
our<00:03:26.700> lighting<00:03:27.120> might<00:03:27.269> be<00:03:27.390> just<00:03:27.570> a<00:03:27.660> little<00:03:27.690> bit

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
our lighting might be just a little bit

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:31.330 
our lighting might be just a little bit
on<00:03:28.560> the<00:03:28.860> dim<00:03:29.100> side<00:03:29.489> so<00:03:30.420> let's<00:03:30.780> take<00:03:30.989> our

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 
on the dim side so let's take our

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:33.800 
on the dim side so let's take our
intensity<00:03:32.340> and<00:03:32.610> we're<00:03:33.030> going<00:03:33.150> to<00:03:33.180> boost<00:03:33.570> it

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
intensity and we're going to boost it

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:37.250 
intensity and we're going to boost it
just<00:03:34.799> a<00:03:35.150> little<00:03:36.150> bit<00:03:36.299> so<00:03:36.690> we've<00:03:37.110> gone<00:03:37.200> from

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
just a little bit so we've gone from

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.250 
just a little bit so we've gone from
0.25<00:03:37.680> to<00:03:38.190> about<00:03:38.370> 0.35<00:03:38.940> and<00:03:39.420> we'll<00:03:39.989> go<00:03:40.110> with

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
0.25 to about 0.35 and we'll go with

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:41.180 
0.25 to about 0.35 and we'll go with
that<00:03:40.380> we<00:03:40.530> can<00:03:40.650> always<00:03:40.830> make<00:03:40.980> further

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
that we can always make further

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:42.979 
that we can always make further
adjustments<00:03:41.400> to<00:03:41.850> it<00:03:41.940> later<00:03:42.209> if<00:03:42.420> we<00:03:42.450> see<00:03:42.750> fit

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989 
adjustments to it later if we see fit

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:45.410 
adjustments to it later if we see fit
but<00:03:43.590> let's<00:03:43.739> take<00:03:43.890> a<00:03:43.950> look<00:03:44.310> at<00:03:44.519> our<00:03:45.000> level<00:03:45.390> now

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 
but let's take a look at our level now

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.020 
but let's take a look at our level now
so<00:03:45.750> I'm<00:03:45.810> just<00:03:45.959> going<00:03:46.140> to<00:03:46.170> tap<00:03:46.320> the<00:03:46.470> play<00:03:46.620> button

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:47.030 
so I'm just going to tap the play button

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:50.600 
so I'm just going to tap the play button
and<00:03:48.320> here<00:03:49.320> we<00:03:49.440> are<00:03:49.470> we<00:03:49.860> have<00:03:49.890> light<00:03:50.340> now<00:03:50.549> we

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:50.610 
and here we are we have light now we

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:52.820 
and here we are we have light now we
can't<00:03:50.940> really<00:03:51.030> see<00:03:51.420> the<00:03:52.140> result<00:03:52.590> of<00:03:52.769> the

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:52.830 
can't really see the result of the

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:54.350 
can't really see the result of the
lighting<00:03:53.130> right<00:03:53.250> now<00:03:53.400> I<00:03:53.430> mean<00:03:53.580> the<00:03:53.790> the<00:03:54.120> trees

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.360 
lighting right now I mean the the trees

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.060 
lighting right now I mean the the trees
aren't<00:03:54.600> casting<00:03:55.170> any<00:03:55.260> light<00:03:55.500> but<00:03:55.650> we<00:03:55.769> can<00:03:55.799> see

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:56.070 
aren't casting any light but we can see

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:58.970 
aren't casting any light but we can see
it<00:03:56.100> on<00:03:56.250> the<00:03:56.370> terrain<00:03:56.700> as<00:03:57.510> for<00:03:57.750> which<00:03:57.989> sides<00:03:58.709> of

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
it on the terrain as for which sides of

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:00.380 
it on the terrain as for which sides of
the<00:03:59.070> terrain<00:03:59.370> are<00:03:59.580> in<00:03:59.670> shadow<00:03:59.940> and<00:04:00.269> which

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:00.390 
the terrain are in shadow and which

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:03.680 
the terrain are in shadow and which
sides<00:04:00.690> are<00:04:00.900> illuminated<00:04:01.530> as<00:04:02.390> you<00:04:03.390> can<00:04:03.540> already

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.690 
sides are illuminated as you can already

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:06.110 
sides are illuminated as you can already
see<00:04:03.930> and<00:04:04.110> that's<00:04:04.230> pretty<00:04:04.560> cool<00:04:04.739> and<00:04:05.010> I'm<00:04:05.940> going

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
see and that's pretty cool and I'm going

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:07.550 
see and that's pretty cool and I'm going
to<00:04:06.209> gripe<00:04:06.420> about<00:04:06.570> those<00:04:06.840> rocks<00:04:07.110> again<00:04:07.290> per

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
to gripe about those rocks again per

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:08.960 
to gripe about those rocks again per
minute<00:04:07.769> we<00:04:07.860> really<00:04:08.250> got<00:04:08.400> to<00:04:08.489> clean<00:04:08.640> that<00:04:08.670> up

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 
minute we really got to clean that up

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:11.960 
minute we really got to clean that up
but<00:04:09.120> that's<00:04:09.299> okay<00:04:10.430> we'll<00:04:11.430> come<00:04:11.579> back<00:04:11.730> to<00:04:11.850> that

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:11.970 
but that's okay we'll come back to that

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:13.789 
but that's okay we'll come back to that
later<00:04:12.000> so<00:04:12.810> we've<00:04:12.989> got<00:04:13.140> our<00:04:13.260> light<00:04:13.470> in<00:04:13.650> place

00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:13.799 
later so we've got our light in place

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:15.979 
later so we've got our light in place
and<00:04:14.160> now<00:04:14.370> we<00:04:14.430> need<00:04:14.670> to<00:04:14.760> add<00:04:14.910> a<00:04:15.299> lens<00:04:15.810> flare

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:15.989 
and now we need to add a lens flare

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:19.430 
and now we need to add a lens flare
however<00:04:16.950> when<00:04:17.790> we<00:04:17.970> started<00:04:18.419> up<00:04:18.600> our<00:04:18.720> level

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:19.440 
however when we started up our level

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:22.279 
however when we started up our level
when<00:04:19.709> we<00:04:19.859> created<00:04:20.519> our<00:04:20.609> our<00:04:20.840> initial<00:04:21.840> project

00:04:22.279 --> 00:04:22.289 
when we created our our initial project

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:24.950 
when we created our our initial project
we<00:04:22.740> did<00:04:22.919> not<00:04:23.130> load<00:04:23.460> in<00:04:23.669> the<00:04:24.060> lens<00:04:24.479> flares

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 
we did not load in the lens flares

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:26.379 
we did not load in the lens flares
package<00:04:25.680> because

00:04:26.379 --> 00:04:26.389 
package because

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:27.820 
package because
we<00:04:26.479> didn't<00:04:26.659> do<00:04:26.810> that<00:04:26.840> we<00:04:27.110> don't<00:04:27.289> have<00:04:27.439> any<00:04:27.590> lens

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:27.830 
we didn't do that we don't have any lens

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:29.950 
we didn't do that we don't have any lens
flares<00:04:28.129> to<00:04:28.249> play<00:04:28.580> with<00:04:28.789> we<00:04:29.300> need<00:04:29.449> to<00:04:29.509> add<00:04:29.629> those

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:29.960 
flares to play with we need to add those

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:33.339 
flares to play with we need to add those
in<00:04:30.169> now<00:04:30.699> now<00:04:31.699> to<00:04:31.759> do<00:04:31.939> this<00:04:32.120> we<00:04:32.900> already<00:04:33.080> done<00:04:33.259> it

00:04:33.339 --> 00:04:33.349 
in now now to do this we already done it

00:04:33.349 --> 00:04:34.570 
in now now to do this we already done it
a<00:04:33.409> few<00:04:33.560> times<00:04:33.680> in<00:04:33.860> the<00:04:33.949> past<00:04:34.129> I'm<00:04:34.340> going<00:04:34.460> to<00:04:34.520> go

start<00:05:29.689> off<00:05:29.810> by<00:05:29.839> clicking<00:05:30.020> the<00:05:30.409> ones<00:05:30.589> you

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:30.710 
start off by clicking the ones you

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:32.409 
start off by clicking the ones you

absolutely know you're going to need and

00:05:32.419 --> 00:05:34.269 
absolutely know you're going to need and
perhaps<00:05:32.839> when<00:05:33.139> you<00:05:33.229> start<00:05:33.469> you<00:05:33.830> think<00:05:34.099> and

00:05:34.269 --> 00:05:34.279 
perhaps when you start you think and

00:05:34.279 --> 00:05:35.890 
perhaps when you start you think and
maybe<00:05:34.550> I<00:05:34.639> don't<00:05:34.759> need<00:05:35.060> a<00:05:35.120> lens<00:05:35.360> flare<00:05:35.659> and<00:05:35.689> if

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:35.900 
maybe I don't need a lens flare and if

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:37.119 
maybe I don't need a lens flare and if
you<00:05:35.990> think<00:05:36.229> that's<00:05:36.439> probably<00:05:36.620> better<00:05:36.889> not<00:05:37.069> to

00:05:37.119 --> 00:05:37.129 
you think that's probably better not to

00:05:37.129 --> 00:05:38.800 
you think that's probably better not to
load<00:05:37.400> it<00:05:37.520> right<00:05:37.669> now<00:05:37.819> save<00:05:38.389> yourself<00:05:38.719> some

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:38.810 
load it right now save yourself some

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:40.059 
load it right now save yourself some
time<00:05:39.020> and<00:05:39.289> a<00:05:39.319> little<00:05:39.500> bit<00:05:39.589> of<00:05:39.680> space<00:05:39.860> in<00:05:39.889> your

00:05:40.069 --> 00:05:41.769 
time and a little bit of space in your
project<00:05:40.460> so<00:05:41.120> what<00:05:41.180> we're<00:05:41.300> going<00:05:41.389> to<00:05:41.449> do<00:05:41.599> is

project so what we're going to do is
click<00:05:42.259> on<00:05:42.349> light<00:05:42.649> flares<00:05:43.659> click<00:05:44.659> open<00:05:45.020> we'll

00:05:45.339 --> 00:05:45.349 
click on light flares click open we'll

00:05:45.349 --> 00:05:47.589 
click on light flares click open we'll
give<00:05:45.469> this<00:05:45.589> a<00:05:45.649> second<00:05:45.979> to<00:05:46.039> load<00:05:46.219> click<00:05:47.210> import

00:05:47.589 --> 00:05:47.599 
give this a second to load click import

00:05:47.599 --> 00:05:52.200 
give this a second to load click import
and<00:05:48.490> the<00:05:49.490> load<00:05:49.669> is<00:05:49.699> really<00:05:50.120> really<00:05:50.330> fast<00:05:50.569> and

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:52.210 
and the load is really really fast and

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:56.079 
and the load is really really fast and
we<00:05:53.210> now<00:05:53.389> have<00:05:53.419> light<00:05:54.319> flares<00:05:54.649> and<00:05:55.009> there's<00:05:55.759> 15

00:05:56.079 --> 00:05:56.089 
we now have light flares and there's 15

00:05:56.089 --> 00:05:58.019 
we now have light flares and there's 15
millimeter<00:05:56.419> zoom<00:05:56.479> small<00:05:57.229> flare<00:05:57.469> and

naturally a Sun flare now adding a flare
to<00:06:01.610> our<00:06:01.939> Sun<00:06:02.300> is<00:06:02.539> an<00:06:02.659> extremely<00:06:03.289> simple

00:06:03.579 --> 00:06:03.589 
to our Sun is an extremely simple

00:06:03.589 --> 00:06:06.730 
to our Sun is an extremely simple
process<00:06:04.159> if<00:06:04.339> we<00:06:05.180> grab<00:06:05.479> our<00:06:05.779> sunlight<00:06:06.439> here

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:06.740

inside<00:06:06.919> the<00:06:07.039> hierarchy<00:06:07.430> view<00:06:07.669> and<00:06:07.909> take<00:06:08.419> a

00:06:08.469 --> 00:06:08.479 
inside the hierarchy view and take a

00:06:08.479 --> 00:06:10.689 
inside the hierarchy view and take a
look<00:06:08.659> at<00:06:08.719> its<00:06:08.839> properties<00:06:09.139> we<00:06:10.039> see<00:06:10.219> there<00:06:10.490> is<00:06:10.580> a

00:06:10.689 --> 00:06:10.699 
look at its properties we see there is a

00:06:10.699 --> 00:06:12.639 
look at its properties we see there is a
flare<00:06:11.029> property<00:06:11.569> and<00:06:11.750> this<00:06:11.899> is<00:06:12.050> a<00:06:12.080> texture

00:06:12.639 --> 00:06:12.649 
flare property and this is a texture

00:06:12.649 --> 00:06:14.409 
flare property and this is a texture
reference<00:06:13.099> now<00:06:13.759> we've<00:06:13.939> already<00:06:14.120> been

clicking on the little tiny circle area

00:06:16.159 --> 00:06:19.119 
clicking on the little tiny circle area
and<00:06:16.719> this<00:06:17.719> gives<00:06:17.960> you<00:06:18.020> access<00:06:18.199> to<00:06:18.469> any<00:06:18.860> of<00:06:18.949> the

appropriate assets that could be

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:21.770 
associated with it so we could just

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:24.510 
associated with it so we could just

and<00:06:34.490> drag<00:06:35.479> and<00:06:35.779> drop<00:06:36.289> it<00:06:36.529> right<00:06:36.800> on<00:06:37.729> top<00:06:38.029> of<00:06:38.060> the

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:38.180 
and drag and drop it right on top of the

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:40.450 
and drag and drop it right on top of the
flare<00:06:38.389> reference<00:06:38.750> and<00:06:38.930> that<00:06:39.800> makes<00:06:40.009> the

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:40.460 
flare reference and that makes the

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:42.999 
flare reference and that makes the
Association<00:06:41.000> as<00:06:41.120> well<00:06:41.150> so<00:06:41.900> now<00:06:42.020> if<00:06:42.350> we<00:06:42.380> were<00:06:42.949> to

00:06:42.999 --> 00:06:43.009 
Association as well so now if we were to

00:06:43.009 --> 00:06:45.490 
Association as well so now if we were to
look<00:06:43.550> back<00:06:43.610> up<00:06:43.970> into<00:06:44.120> the<00:06:44.300> sky<00:06:44.449> we're<00:06:45.410> not

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:45.500 
look back up into the sky we're not

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:46.360 
look back up into the sky we're not
going<00:06:45.620> to<00:06:45.680> see<00:06:45.770> anything<00:06:45.919> yet<00:06:46.100> until<00:06:46.340> we

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:46.370 
going to see anything yet until we

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:50.080 
going to see anything yet until we
actually<00:06:46.520> play<00:06:46.789> the<00:06:46.910> game<00:06:46.940> but<00:06:48.729> look<00:06:49.729> up<00:06:49.880> and

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:50.090 
actually play the game but look up and

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:52.779 
actually play the game but look up and
there's<00:06:50.840> a<00:06:50.990> Sun<00:06:51.410> showing<00:06:51.889> through<00:06:52.099> which<00:06:52.550> in

00:06:52.779 --> 00:06:52.789 
there's a Sun showing through which in

00:06:52.789 --> 00:06:54.670 
there's a Sun showing through which in
our<00:06:53.060> case<00:06:53.210> is<00:06:53.630> actually<00:06:53.930> giving<00:06:54.199> the<00:06:54.319> effect

00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:54.680 
our case is actually giving the effect

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:56.110 
our case is actually giving the effect
that<00:06:54.770> the<00:06:54.949> clouds<00:06:55.220> are<00:06:55.430> kind<00:06:55.580> of<00:06:55.639> thinning<00:06:56.000> out

00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:56.120 
that the clouds are kind of thinning out

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:57.550 
that the clouds are kind of thinning out
right<00:06:56.360> there<00:06:56.509> in<00:06:56.599> that<00:06:56.630> one<00:06:56.840> little<00:06:56.990> area<00:06:57.169> and

00:06:57.550 --> 00:06:57.560 
right there in that one little area and

00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:59.830 
right there in that one little area and
you<00:06:57.949> can<00:06:58.069> make<00:06:58.430> out<00:06:58.580> the<00:06:58.789> Sun<00:06:59.060> kind<00:06:59.419> of<00:06:59.539> coming

00:06:59.830 --> 00:06:59.840 
you can make out the Sun kind of coming

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:01.689 
you can make out the Sun kind of coming
through<00:06:59.870> the<00:07:00.080> trees<00:07:00.229> it's<00:07:01.220> sort<00:07:01.430> of<00:07:01.490> a<00:07:01.580> nice

00:07:01.689 --> 00:07:01.699 
through the trees it's sort of a nice

00:07:01.699 --> 00:07:04.390 
through the trees it's sort of a nice
effect<00:07:01.910> yes<00:07:02.479> I<00:07:02.690> realize<00:07:03.229> it's<00:07:03.560> probably<00:07:03.740> not

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:04.400 
effect yes I realize it's probably not

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:06.040 
effect yes I realize it's probably not
the<00:07:04.610> most<00:07:04.729> realistic<00:07:05.150> effect<00:07:05.660> in<00:07:05.780> the<00:07:05.870> world

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:06.050 
the most realistic effect in the world

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:08.350 
the most realistic effect in the world
but<00:07:06.650> it<00:07:06.740> gets<00:07:06.860> a<00:07:06.949> point<00:07:07.130> across<00:07:07.280> so<00:07:07.580> if<00:07:07.970> you'd

00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:08.360 
but it gets a point across so if you'd

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:09.969 
but it gets a point across so if you'd
like<00:07:08.539> to<00:07:08.720> use<00:07:08.900> a<00:07:08.930> lens<00:07:09.229> flare<00:07:09.410> in<00:07:09.590> your<00:07:09.710> level

00:07:09.969 --> 00:07:09.979 
like to use a lens flare in your level

00:07:09.979 --> 00:07:14.830 
like to use a lens flare in your level
you<00:07:10.430> now<00:07:10.580> know<00:07:10.789> how<00:07:13.000> Jessamine<00:07:14.000> yeah<00:07:14.360> like

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:14.840 
you now know how Jessamine yeah like

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:16.510 
you now know how Jessamine yeah like
took<00:07:14.990> a<00:07:15.080> deep<00:07:15.229> breath<00:07:15.259> inking<00:07:16.160> about<00:07:16.220> it

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:18.470 
whether or not go ahead and I hit the

00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:20.830 
whether or not go ahead and I hit the
draw<00:07:18.710> halo<00:07:19.130> I<00:07:19.310> check<00:07:20.030> right<00:07:20.210> above<00:07:20.419> the<00:07:20.599> flare

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:20.840 
draw halo I check right above the flare

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:23.770 
draw halo I check right above the flare
in<00:07:21.020> oh<00:07:21.199> sure<00:07:22.070> yeah<00:07:22.400> yeah<00:07:22.789> wait<00:07:23.449> if<00:07:23.570> we're<00:07:23.690> gonna

going to be able to see too much it is
at<00:07:28.160> the<00:07:28.280> white<00:07:28.460> because<00:07:29.120> yeah<00:07:29.330> because<00:07:29.630> of<00:07:29.720> the

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:29.810 
at the white because yeah because of the

00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:31.629 
at the white because yeah because of the
white<00:07:29.990> let's<00:07:30.289> see<00:07:30.410> can<00:07:30.590> I<00:07:30.740> I<00:07:31.039> can<00:07:31.280> click<00:07:31.430> out<00:07:31.580> of

00:07:31.629 --> 00:07:31.639 
white let's see can I I can click out of

00:07:31.639 --> 00:07:33.070 
white let's see can I I can click out of
here<00:07:31.849> I<00:07:31.880> can<00:07:32.090> turn<00:07:32.270> that<00:07:32.419> on<00:07:32.630> and<00:07:32.659> off<00:07:32.870> and

00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:33.080 
here I can turn that on and off and

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:34.390 
here I can turn that on and off and
you're<00:07:33.169> not<00:07:33.259> really<00:07:33.500> going<00:07:33.620> to<00:07:33.680> see<00:07:33.860> much<00:07:34.130> of<00:07:34.159> a

00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:34.400 
you're not really going to see much of a

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:37.240 
you're not really going to see much of a
result<00:07:34.960> and<00:07:35.960> we'll<00:07:36.169> talk<00:07:36.470> about<00:07:36.680> the

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:37.250 
result and we'll talk about the

00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:38.860 
result and we'll talk about the
difference<00:07:37.580> between<00:07:37.639> flares<00:07:38.210> and<00:07:38.449> halos

00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:38.870 
difference between flares and halos

00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:41.110 
difference between flares and halos
later<00:07:39.680> on<00:07:39.889> in<00:07:40.069> some<00:07:40.220> video<00:07:40.490> specifically

00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:41.120 
later on in some video specifically

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:42.610 
later on in some video specifically
about<00:07:41.389> lighting<00:07:41.690> and<00:07:41.990> show<00:07:42.110> you<00:07:42.169> exactly<00:07:42.319> how

00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:42.620 
about lighting and show you exactly how

00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:44.680 
about lighting and show you exactly how
they<00:07:42.830> work<00:07:43.009> and<00:07:43.159> how<00:07:43.250> to<00:07:43.370> set<00:07:43.639> them<00:07:43.789> up<00:07:43.909> now

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:44.690 
they work and how to set them up now

00:07:44.690 --> 00:07:46.390 
they work and how to set them up now
that's<00:07:45.380> everything<00:07:45.770> I<00:07:45.830> want<00:07:45.979> to<00:07:46.039> do<00:07:46.130> here<00:07:46.280> is

that's everything I want to do here is
just<00:07:46.610> set<00:07:46.820> up<00:07:46.970> our<00:07:47.090> sunlight<00:07:47.479> go<00:07:47.780> ahead<00:07:47.930> and

00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:48.050 
just set up our sunlight go ahead and

00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:50.680 
just set up our sunlight go ahead and
get<00:07:48.229> a<00:07:48.259> lens<00:07:48.500> flare<00:07:48.740> in<00:07:48.919> place<00:07:49.220> and<00:07:49.550> that<00:07:50.419> is

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:50.690 
get a lens flare in place and that is

00:07:50.690 --> 00:07:51.909 
get a lens flare in place and that is
going<00:07:50.780> to<00:07:50.840> wrap<00:07:50.990> everything<00:07:51.289> up<00:07:51.470> for<00:07:51.710> this
