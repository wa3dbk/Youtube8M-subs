00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
newest version of show me which just

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.240 
newest version of show me which just
came<00:00:27.060> out<00:00:27.210> which<00:00:27.390> is<00:00:27.510> version<00:00:27.689> 2.0<00:00:28.320> I<00:00:28.500> can<00:00:29.099> go

over here to create a new show me just

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:31.999 
over here to create a new show me just
by<00:00:31.080> hitting<00:00:31.230> on<00:00:31.349> the<00:00:31.439> plus<00:00:31.619> sign

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
now I'm met with a very simple

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.299 
now I'm met with a very simple
interactive<00:00:34.469> whiteboard<00:00:34.800> function<00:00:35.160> I<00:00:35.250> can

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
interactive whiteboard function I can

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.459 
interactive whiteboard function I can
choose<00:00:35.610> my<00:00:35.640> ink<00:00:36.030> color<00:00:36.239> over<00:00:36.510> here<00:00:36.540> let's<00:00:37.350> say

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
choose my ink color over here let's say

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.290 
choose my ink color over here let's say
I'm<00:00:37.530> teaching<00:00:37.829> basic<00:00:38.010> math<00:00:38.340> I'm<00:00:38.940> going<00:00:39.239> to

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
I'm teaching basic math I'm going to

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.180 
I'm teaching basic math I'm going to
have<00:00:39.450> my<00:00:39.629> ink<00:00:39.809> color<00:00:40.050> picked<00:00:40.320> over<00:00:41.010> here

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
have my ink color picked over here

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:42.260 
have my ink color picked over here
you'll<00:00:41.340> notice<00:00:41.520> there<00:00:41.700> are<00:00:41.730> a<00:00:41.790> couple<00:00:41.910> of<00:00:42.090> keys

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
you'll notice there are a couple of keys

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.660 
you'll notice there are a couple of keys
so<00:00:42.540> for<00:00:42.719> example<00:00:43.110> I<00:00:43.200> have<00:00:43.410> the<00:00:43.980> reset<00:00:44.640> button

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
so for example I have the reset button

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.270 
so for example I have the reset button
over<00:00:45.000> here<00:00:45.180> or<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.539> erase<00:00:45.930> button<00:00:45.960> I<00:00:46.410> have<00:00:47.070> the

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
over here or the erase button I have the

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.580 
over here or the erase button I have the
clear<00:00:47.640> screen<00:00:47.969> button<00:00:48.239> over<00:00:48.450> here<00:00:48.660> I<00:00:48.809> have<00:00:49.440> the

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
clear screen button over here I have the

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.380 
clear screen button over here I have the
add<00:00:49.710> content<00:00:50.280> button<00:00:50.460> so<00:00:50.730> I<00:00:50.760> can<00:00:50.969> actually<00:00:51.090> do

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
add content button so I can actually do

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:52.580 
add content button so I can actually do
a<00:00:51.420> couple<00:00:51.750> of<00:00:51.780> things<00:00:51.870> here<00:00:52.140> I<00:00:52.170> can<00:00:52.379> choose<00:00:52.559> a

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
a couple of things here I can choose a

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.619 
a couple of things here I can choose a
photo<00:00:52.860> for<00:00:52.980> my<00:00:53.100> library<00:00:53.520> I<00:00:53.699> can<00:00:54.000> take<00:00:54.360> a<00:00:54.390> photo

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
photo for my library I can take a photo

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.450 
photo for my library I can take a photo
or<00:00:55.199> I<00:00:55.230> can<00:00:55.379> actually<00:00:55.500> search<00:00:55.890> images<00:00:56.250> on<00:00:56.399> the

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
or I can actually search images on the

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:57.830 
or I can actually search images on the
web<00:00:56.579> so<00:00:56.850> if<00:00:56.910> I<00:00:57.000> was<00:00:57.090> teaching<00:00:57.390> a<00:00:57.449> lesson<00:00:57.600> in

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
web so if I was teaching a lesson in

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.689 
web so if I was teaching a lesson in
English<00:00:58.140> and<00:00:58.379> come<00:00:58.890> over<00:00:59.010> here<00:00:59.129> and<00:00:59.370> type<00:00:59.520> in

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
English and come over here and type in

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.990 
English and come over here and type in
let's<00:00:59.879> say<00:01:00.000> Freytag's<00:01:00.480> pyramid<00:01:00.660> and<00:01:01.969> get<00:01:02.969> a

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
let's say Freytag's pyramid and get a

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.219 
let's say Freytag's pyramid and get a
whole<00:01:03.210> bunch<00:01:03.239> of<00:01:03.420> images<00:01:03.780> that<00:01:03.809> would<00:01:03.989> pop<00:01:04.199> up

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
whole bunch of images that would pop up

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.770 
whole bunch of images that would pop up
right<00:01:04.500> away<00:01:04.589> I<00:01:04.949> could<00:01:05.489> use<00:01:05.729> that<00:01:05.760> one<00:01:06.150> click<00:01:06.630> on

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
right away I could use that one click on

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.870 
right away I could use that one click on
it<00:01:06.930> notice<00:01:07.439> I<00:01:07.710> have<00:01:07.860> some<00:01:08.040> functions<00:01:08.700> over

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
it notice I have some functions over

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.820 
it notice I have some functions over
here<00:01:09.000> bring<00:01:09.180> to<00:01:09.299> front<00:01:09.479> move<00:01:09.750> to<00:01:09.900> back<00:01:10.110> want<00:01:10.770> to

here bring to front move to back want to
move<00:01:10.950> it<00:01:11.040> to<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.220> front<00:01:11.400> I<00:01:11.640> could<00:01:11.909> rotate<00:01:12.240> it

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
move it to the front I could rotate it

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:13.910 
move it to the front I could rotate it
of<00:01:12.600> course<00:01:12.750> I'm<00:01:12.990> going<00:01:13.110> to<00:01:13.170> click<00:01:13.350> off<00:01:13.530> of<00:01:13.590> it

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
of course I'm going to click off of it

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.310 
of course I'm going to click off of it
which<00:01:14.460> is<00:01:14.610> going<00:01:14.700> to<00:01:14.760> set<00:01:14.939> it<00:01:15.060> in<00:01:15.119> place<00:01:15.320> my

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
which is going to set it in place my
