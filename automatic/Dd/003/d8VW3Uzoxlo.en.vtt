and<00:03:11.019> that's<00:03:11.650> because<00:03:11.950> it<00:03:12.100> is<00:03:12.870> the<00:03:13.870> main

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:13.989 
and that's because it is the main

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:15.930 
and that's because it is the main
argument<00:03:14.500> when<00:03:14.590> I<00:03:14.620> talk<00:03:14.890> about<00:03:15.040> boots<00:03:15.760> by

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:15.940 
argument when I talk about boots by

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:18.930 
argument when I talk about boots by
position<00:03:16.390> that<00:03:16.569> I<00:03:16.600> use<00:03:16.959> as<00:03:17.170> I<00:03:17.620> say<00:03:18.010> if<00:03:18.579> you<00:03:18.790> put

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:18.940 
position that I use as I say if you put

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:21.120 
position that I use as I say if you put
a<00:03:19.000> player<00:03:19.269> out<00:03:19.540> let's<00:03:19.780> say<00:03:19.930> a<00:03:19.959> speedy<00:03:20.680> winger

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.130

according to boots by position that's

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.990 
according to boots by position that's
the<00:03:28.780> optimal<00:03:29.380> shoe<00:03:29.620> choice<00:03:29.950> for<00:03:30.280> him<00:03:30.459> and<00:03:30.700> you

in<00:04:41.620> their<00:04:41.830> soccer<00:04:42.130> shoes<00:04:42.490> rather<00:04:43.090> than

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:43.419 
in their soccer shoes rather than

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:45.840 
in their soccer shoes rather than
themselves<00:04:43.630> that<00:04:44.560> if<00:04:44.830> they<00:04:45.040> wear<00:04:45.340> this

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:45.850 
themselves that if they wear this

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:47.310 
themselves that if they wear this
control<00:04:46.300> boot<00:04:46.510> they're<00:04:46.690> gonna<00:04:46.780> have<00:04:47.020> a

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:47.320 
control boot they're gonna have a

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:49.050 
control boot they're gonna have a
tremendously<00:04:48.070> better<00:04:48.370> touch<00:04:48.639> on<00:04:48.820> the<00:04:48.940> ball

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:49.060 
tremendously better touch on the ball

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:51.420 
tremendously better touch on the ball
and<00:04:49.360> say<00:04:49.510> if<00:04:49.630> they<00:04:49.750> wore<00:04:49.990> a<00:04:50.200> power<00:04:50.560> boot<00:04:50.919> it's

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:51.430 
and say if they wore a power boot it's

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:53.879 
and say if they wore a power boot it's
just<00:04:51.700> crazy<00:04:52.030> to<00:04:52.210> me<00:04:52.480> and<00:04:52.720> I<00:04:52.780> think<00:04:53.020> after<00:04:53.620> that

00:04:53.879 --> 00:04:53.889 
just crazy to me and I think after that

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:55.140 
just crazy to me and I think after that
explanation<00:04:54.220> a<00:04:54.550> lot<00:04:54.700> of<00:04:54.790> you<00:04:54.850> guys<00:04:54.970> will

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:55.150 
explanation a lot of you guys will

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:56.909 
explanation a lot of you guys will
probably<00:04:55.540> agree<00:04:55.600> with<00:04:55.870> me<00:04:56.050> I<00:04:56.230> know<00:04:56.500> some<00:04:56.800> of

00:04:56.909 --> 00:04:56.919 
probably agree with me I know some of

00:04:56.919 --> 00:04:59.280 
probably agree with me I know some of
you<00:04:57.010> will<00:04:57.130> disagree<00:04:57.430> me<00:04:57.669> and<00:04:57.940> say<00:04:58.600> that<00:04:58.870> the

00:04:59.280 --> 00:04:59.290 
you will disagree me and say that the

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:01.110 
you will disagree me and say that the
placebo<00:04:59.680> effect<00:04:59.860> plays<00:05:00.430> a<00:05:00.460> part<00:05:00.730> in<00:05:00.790> this<00:05:00.940> and

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:01.120 
placebo effect plays a part in this and

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:02.100 
placebo effect plays a part in this and
absolutely<00:05:01.780> it<00:05:01.900> does

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:02.110 
absolutely it does

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:04.080 
absolutely it does
absolutely<00:05:03.100> wearing<00:05:03.340> a<00:05:03.400> lightweight<00:05:03.580> shoe<00:05:03.970> is

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:04.090 
absolutely wearing a lightweight shoe is

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:05.730 
absolutely wearing a lightweight shoe is
gonna<00:05:04.270> make<00:05:04.600> you<00:05:04.720> feel<00:05:04.990> like<00:05:05.200> you<00:05:05.350> can<00:05:05.530> run

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:05.740 
gonna make you feel like you can run

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:07.890 
gonna make you feel like you can run
faster<00:05:06.220> you<00:05:06.640> might<00:05:06.790> not<00:05:06.970> actually<00:05:07.000> run<00:05:07.510> faster

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:07.900 
faster you might not actually run faster

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:11.790 
faster you might not actually run faster
and<00:05:08.080> you<00:05:08.169> probably<00:05:09.990> 99.999%<00:05:10.990> of<00:05:11.350> time<00:05:11.590> will

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:11.800 
and you probably 99.999% of time will

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:14.940 
and you probably 99.999% of time will
not<00:05:11.919> run<00:05:12.190> faster<00:05:13.080> that<00:05:14.080> placebo<00:05:14.440> effect<00:05:14.800> does

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:14.950 
not run faster that placebo effect does

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:16.830 
not run faster that placebo effect does
play<00:05:15.160> a<00:05:15.190> part<00:05:15.280> but<00:05:15.940> again<00:05:16.180> that<00:05:16.360> kind<00:05:16.510> of<00:05:16.630> plays

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:16.840 
play a part but again that kind of plays

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:19.290 
play a part but again that kind of plays
into<00:05:16.870> a<00:05:17.169> confidence<00:05:17.740> thing<00:05:17.919> as<00:05:18.040> well<00:05:18.250> if<00:05:19.060> your

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:19.300 
into a confidence thing as well if your

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:21.420 
into a confidence thing as well if your
if<00:05:19.630> your<00:05:19.750> highest<00:05:20.650> level<00:05:20.710> of<00:05:21.010> confidence

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:21.430 
if your highest level of confidence

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:23.159 
if your highest level of confidence
comes<00:05:21.700> from<00:05:21.850> comes<00:05:22.300> from<00:05:22.390> your<00:05:22.630> soccer<00:05:22.840> shoes

00:05:23.159 --> 00:05:23.169 
comes from comes from your soccer shoes

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:24.870 
comes from comes from your soccer shoes
you<00:05:23.560> should<00:05:23.770> probably<00:05:24.010> train<00:05:24.400> a<00:05:24.430> little<00:05:24.760> bit

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:24.880 
you should probably train a little bit

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:27.210 
you should probably train a little bit
more<00:05:25.090> because<00:05:25.330> you<00:05:26.290> shouldn't<00:05:26.919> be<00:05:27.070> out<00:05:27.190> there

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:27.220 
more because you shouldn't be out there

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:28.620 
more because you shouldn't be out there
on<00:05:27.520> the<00:05:27.610> field<00:05:27.820> thinking<00:05:28.060> that<00:05:28.389> you're<00:05:28.540> gonna

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:28.630 
on the field thinking that you're gonna

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:30.150 
on the field thinking that you're gonna
beat<00:05:28.870> this<00:05:29.020> defender<00:05:29.410> to<00:05:29.530> the<00:05:29.590> ball<00:05:29.860> because

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:30.160 
beat this defender to the ball because

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:31.469 
beat this defender to the ball because
you<00:05:30.310> have<00:05:30.460> a<00:05:30.490> pair<00:05:30.729> of<00:05:30.760> Evo<00:05:31.060> speeds<00:05:31.300> or<00:05:31.419> you

00:05:31.469 --> 00:05:31.479 
you have a pair of Evo speeds or you

00:05:31.479 --> 00:05:32.880 
you have a pair of Evo speeds or you
have<00:05:31.600> a<00:05:31.660> pair<00:05:31.780> of<00:05:31.840> a<00:05:31.990> DS<00:05:32.169> Eros<00:05:32.440> on<00:05:32.560> your<00:05:32.680> feet

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:32.890 
have a pair of a DS Eros on your feet

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:34.770 
have a pair of a DS Eros on your feet
that's<00:05:33.430> just<00:05:33.760> not<00:05:33.910> right<00:05:34.150> you<00:05:34.600> should<00:05:34.750> be

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:34.780 
that's just not right you should be

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:35.760 
that's just not right you should be
thinking<00:05:35.110> about<00:05:35.200> the<00:05:35.350> game<00:05:35.530> and

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:35.770 
thinking about the game and

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:38.250 
thinking about the game and
concentrating<00:05:36.640> when<00:05:37.479> I<00:05:37.510> ever<00:05:37.870> talk<00:05:38.110> about

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:38.260 
concentrating when I ever talk about

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:39.990 
concentrating when I ever talk about
comfort<00:05:38.710> in<00:05:38.800> soccer<00:05:39.040> shoes<00:05:39.340> when<00:05:39.880> you're

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:40.000 
comfort in soccer shoes when you're

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.730 
comfort in soccer shoes when you're
truly<00:05:40.240> comfortable<00:05:40.660> in<00:05:40.870> a<00:05:40.930> soccer<00:05:41.110> shoe<00:05:41.380> you

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:41.740 
truly comfortable in a soccer shoe you

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:42.690 
truly comfortable in a soccer shoe you
should<00:05:41.860> be<00:05:41.919> able<00:05:42.070> to<00:05:42.130> forget<00:05:42.370> that<00:05:42.520> they<00:05:42.669> are

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:42.700 
should be able to forget that they are

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:44.550 
should be able to forget that they are
on<00:05:42.820> your<00:05:43.030> feet<00:05:43.270> the<00:05:44.020> last<00:05:44.200> thing<00:05:44.380> that<00:05:44.410> I

really want to point out here as far as
kind<00:05:47.140> of<00:05:47.169> demonstrating<00:05:48.070> why<00:05:48.220> boots<00:05:48.550> my

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:48.700 
kind of demonstrating why boots my

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:51.210 
kind of demonstrating why boots my
position<00:05:49.090> is<00:05:49.210> kind<00:05:49.450> of<00:05:49.510> silly<00:05:49.750> to<00:05:49.870> me<00:05:50.080> is<00:05:50.260> when

position is kind of silly to me is when

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:52.920 
position is kind of silly to me is when
you<00:05:51.250> stock<00:05:51.640> up<00:05:51.850> let's<00:05:52.090> say<00:05:52.240> again<00:05:52.510> a<00:05:52.539> speedy

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:52.930 
you stock up let's say again a speedy

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:54.300 
you stock up let's say again a speedy
winger<00:05:53.260> who<00:05:53.440> should<00:05:53.620> be<00:05:53.710> in<00:05:53.800> a<00:05:53.890> speed<00:05:54.130> boot
