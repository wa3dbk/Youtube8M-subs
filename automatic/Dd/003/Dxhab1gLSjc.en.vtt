Samuel and in this episode I'm talking

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.680 
Samuel and in this episode I'm talking
about<00:00:10.530> the<00:00:10.889> process<00:00:11.400> of<00:00:11.490> facilitation<00:00:12.269> and

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
about the process of facilitation and

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.499 
about the process of facilitation and
we're<00:00:13.110> going<00:00:13.290> to<00:00:13.349> look<00:00:13.620> at<00:00:13.740> how<00:00:13.980> this<00:00:14.309> leads<00:00:14.820> to

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
we're going to look at how this leads to

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.590 
we're going to look at how this leads to
a<00:00:15.540> longer<00:00:15.990> and<00:00:16.410> stronger<00:00:17.190> response<00:00:17.520> in<00:00:18.060> the

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
a longer and stronger response in the

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.310 
a longer and stronger response in the
postsynaptic<00:00:19.050> cell<00:00:20.180> now<00:00:21.180> here<00:00:21.900> I'm<00:00:22.080> looking

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
postsynaptic cell now here I'm looking

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.429 
postsynaptic cell now here I'm looking
at<00:00:22.590> a<00:00:23.220> neuron<00:00:24.000> and<00:00:24.330> let's<00:00:24.869> say<00:00:25.080> there's<00:00:25.289> an

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
at a neuron and let's say there's an

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.710 
at a neuron and let's say there's an
action<00:00:25.890> potential<00:00:26.250> that<00:00:26.640> comes<00:00:27.150> along<00:00:27.510> this

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
action potential that comes along this

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.919 
action potential that comes along this
axon<00:00:28.349> and<00:00:28.590> enters<00:00:29.310> into<00:00:29.609> the<00:00:30.000> axon<00:00:30.570> terminal

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
axon and enters into the axon terminal

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.740 
axon and enters into the axon terminal
now<00:00:31.650> I've<00:00:31.800> drawn<00:00:32.099> this<00:00:32.340> terminal<00:00:32.940> a<00:00:33.090> little

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
now I've drawn this terminal a little

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.440 
now I've drawn this terminal a little
bigger<00:00:34.290> than<00:00:34.739> the<00:00:35.130> previous<00:00:35.850> ones<00:00:36.149> because

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
bigger than the previous ones because

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.150 
bigger than the previous ones because
there's<00:00:36.930> a<00:00:36.989> lot<00:00:37.170> of<00:00:37.290> stuff<00:00:37.500> that<00:00:37.620> I<00:00:37.680> wanted<00:00:38.040> you

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
there's a lot of stuff that I wanted you

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.060 
there's a lot of stuff that I wanted you
to<00:00:38.280> see<00:00:38.489> in<00:00:38.670> here<00:00:38.969> as<00:00:39.620> we've<00:00:40.620> mentioned<00:00:40.890> before

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
to see in here as we've mentioned before

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.369 
to see in here as we've mentioned before
when<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:41.969> action<00:00:42.390> potential<00:00:42.870> reaches<00:00:43.260> the

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
when the action potential reaches the

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:44.479 
when the action potential reaches the
axon<00:00:43.860> terminal

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
axon terminal

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.779 
axon terminal
it<00:00:44.610> causes<00:00:45.450> voltage-gated<00:00:46.289> calcium<00:00:46.789> channels

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
it causes voltage-gated calcium channels

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:52.939 
it causes voltage-gated calcium channels
to<00:00:47.940> open<00:00:49.160> calcium<00:00:50.160> ions<00:00:50.640> rush<00:00:51.030> in<00:00:51.300> and<00:00:51.949> that

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
to open calcium ions rush in and that

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.000 
to open calcium ions rush in and that
causes<00:00:53.610> the<00:00:54.230> vesicles<00:00:55.230> to<00:00:55.320> fuse<00:00:55.440> with<00:00:55.980> the

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
causes the vesicles to fuse with the

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.529 
causes the vesicles to fuse with the
membrane<00:00:56.300> releasing<00:00:57.920> neurotransmitter

00:00:59.529 --> 00:00:59.539 
membrane releasing neurotransmitter

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:02.959 
membrane releasing neurotransmitter
causing<00:01:00.539> a<00:01:00.629> signal<00:01:01.140> in<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:02.100> postsynaptic

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
causing a signal in the postsynaptic

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.260 
causing a signal in the postsynaptic
cell<00:01:03.780> now<00:01:04.769> this<00:01:04.979> calcium<00:01:05.430> that<00:01:05.670> rushes<00:01:06.090> in

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
cell now this calcium that rushes in

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.740 
cell now this calcium that rushes in
also<00:01:07.020> causes<00:01:07.619> depolarization<00:01:08.520> because<00:01:09.450> this

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
also causes depolarization because this

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.100 
also causes depolarization because this
has<00:01:09.930> a<00:01:09.960> positive<00:01:10.530> charge<00:01:10.560> and<00:01:11.450> usually<00:01:12.450> what

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
has a positive charge and usually what

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.920 
has a positive charge and usually what
happens<00:01:13.140> after<00:01:14.130> that<00:01:14.159> is<00:01:14.930> voltage-gated

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
happens after that is voltage-gated

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.560 
happens after that is voltage-gated
potassium<00:01:16.310> channels<00:01:17.310> open<00:01:17.549> and<00:01:17.909> potassium

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
potassium channels open and potassium

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.590 
potassium channels open and potassium
rushes<00:01:18.990> out<00:01:19.380> of<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:19.740> cell<00:01:20.509> repolarizing<00:01:21.509> the

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
rushes out of the cell repolarizing the

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.200 
rushes out of the cell repolarizing the
membrane<00:01:22.020> ending<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:23.070> signal<00:01:23.520> ending

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
membrane ending the signal ending

neurotransmitter<00:01:27.780> release<00:01:28.400> now<00:01:29.400> in<00:01:29.729> the

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
neurotransmitter release now in the

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.749 
neurotransmitter release now in the
process<00:01:30.090> of<00:01:30.450> facilitation<00:01:31.229> we<00:01:32.130> have<00:01:32.400> this

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
process of facilitation we have this

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.560 
process of facilitation we have this
facility<00:01:33.570> ori<00:01:34.170> neuron<00:01:35.009> or<00:01:35.640> you<00:01:35.939> can<00:01:36.119> kind<00:01:36.509> of

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
facility ori neuron or you can kind of

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.640 
facility ori neuron or you can kind of
call<00:01:36.750> this<00:01:36.900> a<00:01:36.960> presynaptic<00:01:38.060> synapse<00:01:39.060> and<00:01:39.650> this

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
call this a presynaptic synapse and this

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.999 
call this a presynaptic synapse and this
neuron<00:01:41.250> releases<00:01:41.820> the<00:01:42.360> neurotransmitter

00:01:42.999 --> 00:01:43.009 
neuron releases the neurotransmitter

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:46.929 
neuron releases the neurotransmitter
serotonin<00:01:45.079> when<00:01:46.079> it<00:01:46.200> releases<00:01:46.619> that

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:46.939 
serotonin when it releases that

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:49.969 
serotonin when it releases that
neurotransmitter<00:01:47.939> serotonin<00:01:48.470> that<00:01:49.470> binds<00:01:49.950> to

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
neurotransmitter serotonin that binds to

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.850 
neurotransmitter serotonin that binds to
the<00:01:50.159> receptor<00:01:50.820> and<00:01:50.960> this<00:01:51.960> is<00:01:52.200> a<00:01:52.229> metabotropic

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
the receptor and this is a metabotropic

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.060 
the receptor and this is a metabotropic
receptor<00:01:53.430> and<00:01:54.000> this<00:01:54.930> one<00:01:55.350> specifically

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
receptor and this one specifically

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.600 
receptor and this one specifically
activates<00:01:56.820> a<00:01:57.000> g-protein<00:01:57.799> that<00:01:58.799> g-protein

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
activates a g-protein that g-protein

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.830 
activates a g-protein that g-protein
activates<00:02:00.450> adenylate<00:02:01.280> cyclase<00:02:02.840> adenylate

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
activates adenylate cyclase adenylate

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:09.229 
activates adenylate cyclase adenylate
cyclase<00:02:04.549> converts<00:02:05.549> ATP<00:02:05.790> to<00:02:06.479> cyclic<00:02:07.350> ANP<00:02:08.239> which

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
cyclase converts ATP to cyclic ANP which

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:12.460 
cyclase converts ATP to cyclic ANP which
then<00:02:09.599> activates<00:02:10.440> a<00:02:10.649> protein<00:02:11.340> kinase

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
then activates a protein kinase

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:13.940 
then activates a protein kinase
specifically<00:02:13.470> protein

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
specifically protein

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.000 
specifically protein
kinase<00:02:14.430> C<00:02:14.790> so<00:02:15.750> I'll<00:02:15.870> put<00:02:16.050> a<00:02:16.080> C<00:02:16.319> right<00:02:16.530> here<00:02:16.560> and

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
kinase C so I'll put a C right here and

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.990 
kinase C so I'll put a C right here and
that<00:02:17.970> protein<00:02:18.450> kinase<00:02:19.080> phosphorylates<00:02:20.000> the

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
that protein kinase phosphorylates the

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.540 
that protein kinase phosphorylates the
voltage-gated<00:02:21.780> potassium<00:02:22.340> channels<00:02:23.340> and

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
voltage-gated potassium channels and

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:26.300 
voltage-gated potassium channels and
what<00:02:24.120> that<00:02:24.390> does<00:02:24.720> is<00:02:25.080> it<00:02:25.560> shuts<00:02:25.920> those

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
what that does is it shuts those

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.320 
what that does is it shuts those
channels<00:02:26.760> so<00:02:27.690> potassium<00:02:28.310> cannot<00:02:29.310> leave<00:02:29.849> as

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
channels so potassium cannot leave as

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.750 
channels so potassium cannot leave as
easily<00:02:30.780> as<00:02:31.140> it<00:02:31.319> would<00:02:31.620> have<00:02:31.769> in<00:02:32.069> a<00:02:32.220> regular

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
easily as it would have in a regular

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:38.240 
easily as it would have in a regular
situation<00:02:33.769> so<00:02:34.769> the<00:02:34.950> net<00:02:35.190> result<00:02:35.430> here<00:02:36.150> is<00:02:37.250> we

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
situation so the net result here is we

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.390 
situation so the net result here is we
have<00:02:38.280> an<00:02:38.640> action<00:02:39.060> potential<00:02:39.390> that<00:02:39.660> comes<00:02:39.959> down

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
have an action potential that comes down

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.390 
have an action potential that comes down
we<00:02:41.400> have<00:02:42.440> depolarization<00:02:43.440> but<00:02:43.950> instead<00:02:44.250> of

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
we have depolarization but instead of

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.630 
we have depolarization but instead of
repolarization<00:02:45.180> happening<00:02:45.810> quickly

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640 
repolarization happening quickly

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:51.559 
repolarization happening quickly
repolarization<00:02:47.640> takes<00:02:48.299> longer<00:02:49.260> to<00:02:50.040> happen<00:02:50.569> it

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:51.569 
repolarization takes longer to happen it

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:54.020 
repolarization takes longer to happen it
causes<00:02:52.170> the<00:02:52.290> action<00:02:52.739> potential<00:02:53.310> the<00:02:53.489> signal

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:58.190 
causes the action potential the signal
here<00:02:54.750> to<00:02:55.290> last<00:02:55.590> longer<00:02:56.220> and<00:02:56.579> of<00:02:57.510> course<00:02:57.810> what's

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
here to last longer and of course what's

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.440 
here to last longer and of course what's
that<00:02:58.440> what<00:02:58.860> that's<00:02:59.099> going<00:02:59.340> to<00:02:59.430> do<00:02:59.640> is<00:02:59.849> it's

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
that what that's going to do is it's

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.569 
that what that's going to do is it's
going<00:03:00.540> to<00:03:00.690> cause<00:03:00.930> more<00:03:01.440> vesicles<00:03:02.310> to<00:03:02.459> fuse
