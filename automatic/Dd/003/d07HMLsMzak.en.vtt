00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
that I mean a lot of these already come

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.150 
that I mean a lot of these already come
with<00:00:40.020> it<00:00:40.200> I'll<00:00:40.290> just<00:00:40.440> talk<00:00:40.620> about<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:40.890> ones

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
with it I'll just talk about the ones

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.600 
with it I'll just talk about the ones
that<00:00:41.430> that<00:00:41.730> don't<00:00:41.940> necessarily<00:00:42.120> come<00:00:42.750> with

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:43.610 
that that don't necessarily come with

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:46.819 
that that don't necessarily come with
with<00:00:44.610> it<00:00:44.760> this<00:00:44.940> is<00:00:45.090> crap<00:00:45.360> cleaner<00:00:45.719> I<00:00:45.989> really

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
with it this is crap cleaner I really

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:52.600 
with it this is crap cleaner I really
like<00:00:46.980> this<00:00:47.160> program<00:00:48.110> because<00:00:49.110> it<00:00:49.410> clears<00:00:50.219> out

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:52.610 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:54.860 

clears<00:00:53.610> out<00:00:53.730> my<00:00:53.879> my<00:00:54.180> cookies<00:00:54.600> and<00:00:54.780> everything

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
clears out my my cookies and everything

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.200 
clears out my my cookies and everything
when<00:00:55.440> I<00:00:55.469> want<00:00:55.680> to<00:00:55.710> do<00:00:55.890> that<00:00:56.039> and<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:57.030> other

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
when I want to do that and the other

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.060 
when I want to do that and the other
thing<00:00:57.300> that<00:00:57.629> it<00:00:57.750> does<00:00:57.930> is<00:00:58.230> when<00:00:58.590> you<00:00:58.649> go<00:00:58.920> over

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
thing that it does is when you go over

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.689 
thing that it does is when you go over
to<00:00:59.160> the<00:00:59.250> applications<00:01:00.030> and<00:01:00.480> you<00:01:01.050> select<00:01:01.699> Flash

what common hunt Pro is is it's just a

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.609 
what common hunt Pro is is it's just a
software<00:01:49.770> that<00:01:49.890> that<00:01:50.399> finds<00:01:51.390> places<00:01:52.140> blogs

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
software that that finds places blogs

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.370

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
so usually I outsource that but it's a

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:01.999 
so usually I outsource that but it's a
good<00:02:01.020> little<00:02:01.290> program<00:02:01.619> because<00:02:01.829> it's

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
good little program because it's

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:08.570
