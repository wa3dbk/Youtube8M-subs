Snoopy sno-cone machine when I was
younger<00:00:44.760> when<00:00:45.510> I<00:00:45.570> was<00:00:45.719> a<00:00:45.750> wee<00:00:45.809> lad<00:00:46.280> there<00:00:47.280> was

younger when I was a wee lad there was

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.610 
younger when I was a wee lad there was
such<00:00:47.940> a<00:00:47.969> thing<00:00:48.239> as<00:00:48.510> a<00:00:48.660> Snoopy<00:00:49.289> sno-cone

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
such a thing as a Snoopy sno-cone

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.139 
such a thing as a Snoopy sno-cone
machine<00:00:49.920> now<00:00:50.190> there<00:00:50.370> were<00:00:50.460> several<00:00:50.760> different

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
machine now there were several different

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.389 
machine now there were several different
snow<00:00:51.449> cone<00:00:51.660> machines<00:00:52.050> essentially<00:00:52.949> the<00:00:53.070> exact

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
snow cone machines essentially the exact

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.250 
snow cone machines essentially the exact
same<00:00:53.579> thing<00:00:53.879> was<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.239> it<00:00:54.629> was<00:00:54.719> the<00:00:54.780> same<00:00:54.960> idea

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
same thing was the it was the same idea

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.139 
same thing was the it was the same idea
with<00:00:55.379> all<00:00:55.530> of<00:00:55.680> them<00:00:55.800> you<00:00:55.980> put<00:00:56.460> ice<00:00:56.640> cubes<00:00:56.879> in

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
with all of them you put ice cubes in

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.330 
with all of them you put ice cubes in
and<00:00:57.329> then<00:00:57.989> you<00:00:58.109> would<00:00:58.230> you<00:00:58.590> would<00:00:58.710> turn<00:00:59.309> a

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
and then you would you would turn a

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.790 
and then you would you would turn a
lever<00:00:59.850> at<00:01:00.149> the<00:01:00.180> back<00:01:00.480> and<00:01:00.870> it<00:01:00.989> would<00:01:01.440> grind

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
lever at the back and it would grind

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.640 
lever at the back and it would grind
that<00:01:02.219> ice<00:01:02.460> down<00:01:02.820> into<00:01:03.480> a<00:01:03.510> slush<00:01:03.989> that<00:01:04.320> you

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
that ice down into a slush that you

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.950 
that ice down into a slush that you
would<00:01:04.769> put<00:01:04.949> into<00:01:05.070> a<00:01:05.159> cup<00:01:05.489> now<00:01:06.150> they<00:01:06.330> say<00:01:06.600> fruit

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
would put into a cup now they say fruit

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.630 
would put into a cup now they say fruit
juice<00:01:07.229> but<00:01:07.260> who<00:01:07.619> are<00:01:07.680> we<00:01:07.799> kidding<00:01:07.830> back<00:01:08.400> in<00:01:08.549> the

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
juice but who are we kidding back in the

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.940 
juice but who are we kidding back in the
80s<00:01:09.030> when<00:01:09.510> I<00:01:09.570> had<00:01:09.840> the<00:01:09.990> original<00:01:10.260> Snoopy<00:01:10.770> snow

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
80s when I had the original Snoopy snow

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.340 
80s when I had the original Snoopy snow
cone<00:01:11.159> machine<00:01:11.460> we<00:01:12.150> would<00:01:12.299> we<00:01:12.659> basically<00:01:13.049> take

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
cone machine we would we basically take

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.520 
cone machine we would we basically take
kool-aid<00:01:13.950> and<00:01:14.220> make<00:01:14.790> a<00:01:15.020> concentrated<00:01:16.020> sugary

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
kool-aid and make a concentrated sugary

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.580 
kool-aid and make a concentrated sugary
kool-aid<00:01:17.009> that<00:01:17.040> he<00:01:17.250> would<00:01:17.400> drizzle<00:01:17.759> on<00:01:17.909> top

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:18.590 
kool-aid that he would drizzle on top

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.950 
kool-aid that he would drizzle on top

really wish when I was younger and I
grew<00:02:04.740> up<00:02:04.770> I<00:02:05.070> always<00:02:05.219> wished<00:02:05.520> I<00:02:05.700> could<00:02:05.909> have

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.440

unfortunate<00:02:08.580> my<00:02:08.640> parents<00:02:08.940> just<00:02:09.000> gave<00:02:09.270> it<00:02:09.390> away

unfortunate my parents just gave it away

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:10.969 
unfortunate my parents just gave it away
because<00:02:09.929> you<00:02:10.020> know<00:02:10.140> by<00:02:10.349> that<00:02:10.500> point<00:02:10.709> I<00:02:10.860> was

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
because you know by that point I was

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:11.890

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660 
there was no need for me to have it

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:16.449 
there was no need for me to have it
anymore<00:02:14.959> so<00:02:15.590> they<00:02:15.709> just<00:02:15.860> gave<00:02:16.040> it<00:02:16.190> away

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:47.229 
juice but again who are we kidding back
in<00:02:45.680> the<00:02:45.739> 80s<00:02:46.069> it<00:02:46.250> was<00:02:46.310> ghetto<00:02:46.640> kool-aid<00:02:47.090> my

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:47.239 
in the 80s it was ghetto kool-aid my

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:49.690 
in the 80s it was ghetto kool-aid my
friends<00:02:47.569> but<00:02:48.470> everything<00:02:49.130> about<00:02:49.310> this<00:02:49.459> looks

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
friends but everything about this looks

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.360 
friends but everything about this looks
exactly<00:02:50.000> the<00:02:50.239> same<00:02:50.560> the<00:02:51.560> only<00:02:51.620> thing<00:02:51.799> I<00:02:52.069> think

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
exactly the same the only thing I think

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:53.949 
exactly the same the only thing I think
that's<00:02:52.579> different<00:02:53.030> is<00:02:53.299> the<00:02:53.360> fact<00:02:53.630> they<00:02:53.720> to<00:02:53.810> put

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:53.959 
that's different is the fact they to put

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:55.360 
that's different is the fact they to put
obviously<00:02:54.260> the<00:02:54.380> original<00:02:54.799> because<00:02:54.980> back<00:02:55.340> then

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
obviously the original because back then

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:56.890 
obviously the original because back then
it<00:02:55.640> would<00:02:55.760> have<00:02:55.819> been<00:02:55.940> only<00:02:56.030> be<00:02:56.299> called<00:02:56.540> Snoopy

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900 
it would have been only be called Snoopy

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:58.990 
it would have been only be called Snoopy
sno-cone<00:02:57.319> machine<00:02:57.620> but<00:02:58.370> aside<00:02:58.579> from<00:02:58.640> that<00:02:58.790> the

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 
sno-cone machine but aside from that the

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.390 
sno-cone machine but aside from that the
box<00:02:59.239> is<00:02:59.450> exactly<00:02:59.599> the<00:03:00.319> same<00:03:00.530> as<00:03:00.709> it<00:03:00.799> was<00:03:00.980> as<00:03:01.250> far

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
box is exactly the same as it was as far

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.890 
box is exactly the same as it was as far
as<00:03:01.549> a<00:03:01.579> no<00:03:01.760> to<00:03:02.690> the<00:03:02.840> original<00:03:04.360> now<00:03:05.360> I'm<00:03:05.540> actually
