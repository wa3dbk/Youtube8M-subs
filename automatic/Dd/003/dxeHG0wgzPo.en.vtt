00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 hello everyone with you beauty ksyu i'm like 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:07.649
 always check all the beauty recipes on 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.570
 and today I would like to make a scrub 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:13.650
 for a face that removes excessive 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.849
 dry this scrub is suitable for dry and 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.580
 normal skin 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:20.279
 for oily skin this scrub is not suitable 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.410
 due to the fact that the composition includes colors in 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:25.800
 the composition of the scrub will enter the coffee 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:28.949
 Thick 1 tsp and sour cream 1 tsp 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:31.289
 spoon the drier your skin the higher 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:34.079
 the percentage of fat cream should be 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.570
 coffee must be instant 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.690
 and fine-grained in order not to 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.879
 scratch and not injure your skin 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:44.120
 I remind you that facial scrub we do 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:47.520
 at least once a week to 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:51.120
 remove dead skin particles and 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:55.379
 excessive dryness and so mix with 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:58.020
 coffee grounds with sour cream and put this 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.690
 composition on face and then light 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:03.270
 massaging movements for three 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:06.150
 minutes massage the skin and after that 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:08.880
 leave for another two minutes composition on 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:13.530
 face so that the skin is prescribed and 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:15.750
 wash our face with warm water and so we need 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.390
 wash before we apply scrub 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:22.920
 either clean the skin with tonic if you 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:26.190
 washed recently we do everything by 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.700
 massage lines we remember this 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:31.539

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:40.719

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:44.500
 Generally suitable for any 

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:46.869
 parts of the body im very good scrabble 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:49.810
 body on the spoon elbows ki 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:54.909
 it is very light not injure the skin and 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:56.649
 gently peels and coffee contains caffeine 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:58.869
 which is wonderful 

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:01.170
 antioxidant and improves circulation 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:04.030
 blood in the skin 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:06.250
 tones and and therefore after such 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:09.310
 scrub your skin will shine all day and 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:14.739

 what massage circular movements 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:29.160
 on the skin around the eyes, we do not scrub 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:31.630
 we have very thin skin there 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:36.190
 I have a video about massage lines 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:38.470
 punishment for oily skin in principle 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:40.959
 place sour cream can add kefir 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:43.269
 because sour cream is very fat from not 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:46.000
 oily skin it does not fit and kefir like 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:48.700
 just right that is the owners 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.370
 oily skin can be replaced in this 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:53.620
 recipe sour cream for kefir girls 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:54.130

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:57.430
 scrub 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:03:01.209
 often do not recommend every two 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:05.769
 month because coffee gives a little 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:06.519
 tan skin and so it took three 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:09.970
 minutes 

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:10.989
 now two more minutes I'll just sit with 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:15.180
 this scrub 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:18.689

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:39.659
 skin cream after such a scrub can 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:43.019
