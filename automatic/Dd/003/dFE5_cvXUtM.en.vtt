00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
honestly did not like the level design

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.940 
honestly did not like the level design
i've<00:01:27.120> always<00:01:27.570> loved<00:01:27.900> the<00:01:28.020> level<00:01:28.320> design<00:01:28.470> of

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:32.010 
the old sonic and i think that's the

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:33.350 
the old sonic and i think that's the
most<00:01:32.130> important<00:01:32.610> thing<00:01:32.640> they<00:01:32.940> brought<00:01:33.180> in

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360

classic sonic is strictly 2d platforming
at<00:02:20.810> its<00:02:21.140> best<00:02:21.410> in<00:02:21.769> my<00:02:21.920> opinion<00:02:21.950> it's<00:02:22.519> very

00:02:22.869 --> 00:02:22.879 
at its best in my opinion it's very

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:24.820 
at its best in my opinion it's very
comfortable<00:02:23.269> to<00:02:23.420> use<00:02:23.540> Classic<00:02:23.959> Sonic<00:02:24.110> and<00:02:24.470> I

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
comfortable to use Classic Sonic and I

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:27.339 
comfortable to use Classic Sonic and I
like<00:02:25.069> it<00:02:25.220> although<00:02:26.000> sometimes<00:02:26.209> modern<00:02:27.080> sauna

00:02:27.339 --> 00:02:27.349 
like it although sometimes modern sauna

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:28.960 
like it although sometimes modern sauna
can<00:02:27.590> be<00:02:27.680> better<00:02:27.890> as<00:02:28.010> he<00:02:28.129> can<00:02:28.280> dash<00:02:28.489> in<00:02:28.670> midair

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
can be better as he can dash in midair

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:33.220 
can be better as he can dash in midair

know reviewing Assassin's Creed
Revelations<00:02:43.160> doing<00:02:43.849> that<00:02:44.000> then<00:02:44.480> i<00:02:44.510> might<00:02:44.720> go

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
Revelations doing that then i might go

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.660 
Revelations doing that then i might go
ahead<00:02:45.110> and<00:02:45.470> go<00:02:45.650> to<00:02:45.709> this<00:02:45.890> game<00:02:46.129> and<00:02:46.310> then

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
ahead and go to this game and then

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:48.390 
ahead and go to this game and then
finally<00:02:47.090> I'll<00:02:47.180> go<00:02:47.299> to<00:02:47.360> modern<00:02:47.900> warfare<00:02:48.049> 3

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
finally I'll go to modern warfare 3

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.360 
finally I'll go to modern warfare 3
anyway<00:02:49.400> I<00:02:49.700> guess<00:02:50.540> that<00:02:50.720> concludes<00:02:50.930> the<00:02:51.680> first

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
anyway I guess that concludes the first

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:55.240 
anyway I guess that concludes the first
part<00:02:52.579> and<00:02:53.120> here<00:02:54.019> is<00:02:54.140> modern<00:02:54.560> sonic<00:02:54.920> as<00:02:55.040> you<00:02:55.130> can

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
part and here is modern sonic as you can

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:57.339 
part and here is modern sonic as you can
see<00:02:55.370> right<00:02:55.400> here<00:02:55.760> you<00:02:56.480> can<00:02:56.630> see<00:02:56.750> also<00:02:57.049> that<00:02:57.079> the

00:02:57.339 --> 00:02:57.349 
see right here you can see also that the

00:02:57.349 --> 00:02:59.949 
see right here you can see also that the
environment<00:02:57.709> is<00:02:58.069> a<00:02:58.130> lot<00:02:58.430> more<00:02:58.760> detailed<00:02:59.660> not

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959 
environment is a lot more detailed not

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:02.080 
environment is a lot more detailed not
than<00:03:00.440> classic<00:03:01.190> sonic<00:03:01.370> because<00:03:01.760> they're<00:03:01.879> both

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
than classic sonic because they're both

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:04.240 
than classic sonic because they're both
about<00:03:02.239> details<00:03:03.049> it's<00:03:03.260> just<00:03:03.440> with<00:03:03.829> modern

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
about details it's just with modern

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:05.470 
about details it's just with modern
sonic<00:03:04.579> you<00:03:04.670> see<00:03:04.819> it<00:03:04.940> through<00:03:05.120> different

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480 
sonic you see it through different

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:07.809 
sonic you see it through different
dimensions<00:03:06.049> here<00:03:06.680> you<00:03:06.799> see<00:03:06.950> it<00:03:07.040> in<00:03:07.129> a<00:03:07.190> more<00:03:07.340> 3d

00:03:07.809 --> 00:03:07.819 
dimensions here you see it in a more 3d

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:09.729 
dimensions here you see it in a more 3d
aspect<00:03:08.239> and<00:03:08.599> where<00:03:08.930> you<00:03:09.019> can<00:03:09.140> see<00:03:09.290> more<00:03:09.500> of<00:03:09.560> the

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:13.989 
detail of the of the actual island or

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:16.240 
detail of the of the actual island or
mountainous<00:03:14.989> range<00:03:15.319> i<00:03:15.680> guess<00:03:15.829> you<00:03:15.950> can<00:03:16.099> call

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.250 
mountainous range i guess you can call

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:18.729 
mountainous range i guess you can call
it<00:03:16.310> you<00:03:17.060> could<00:03:17.209> see<00:03:17.239> that<00:03:17.900> each<00:03:18.200> specific

00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:18.739 
it you could see that each specific

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:22.479 
it you could see that each specific
mountain<00:03:19.549> range<00:03:20.239> has<00:03:20.390> its<00:03:20.930> own<00:03:21.230> specific<00:03:22.010> way

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:22.489 
mountain range has its own specific way

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:46.040 
cheesy and really just really cliche

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:48.550 
cheesy and really just really cliche

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:48.560 
kind of talking like he talks like I

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:50.680 
kind of talking like he talks like I
don't<00:05:49.460> know<00:05:49.580> it's<00:05:49.880> just<00:05:50.030> it's<00:05:50.300> hard<00:05:50.420> to

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:50.690 
don't know it's just it's hard to

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:52.960 
don't know it's just it's hard to
describe<00:05:50.990> and<00:05:51.410> describe<00:05:52.040> I<00:05:52.340> guess<00:05:52.700> the<00:05:52.820> best

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:52.970 
describe and describe I guess the best

way<00:05:53.090> I<00:05:53.120> could<00:05:53.210> put<00:05:53.420> it<00:05:53.510> is<00:05:53.660> again<00:05:54.080> cliche<00:05:54.740> but

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:56.380 
way I could put it is again cliche but

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:58.690 
way I could put it is again cliche but
classic<00:05:57.380> sonic<00:05:57.560> only<00:05:57.890> has<00:05:58.010> the<00:05:58.130> sound<00:05:58.400> effects

00:05:58.690 --> 00:05:58.700 
classic sonic only has the sound effects

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:01.590 
classic sonic only has the sound effects
to<00:05:58.850> go<00:05:58.970> by<00:05:59.150> which<00:05:59.690> really<00:06:00.020> makes<00:06:00.320> the<00:06:01.040> entire

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:01.600 
to go by which really makes the entire

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:04.660 
to go by which really makes the entire
character<00:06:02.600> itself<00:06:03.170> come<00:06:03.830> to<00:06:04.010> life<00:06:04.250> as<00:06:04.460> you

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:04.670 
character itself come to life as you
