00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:28.830 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:32.040 

once<00:01:29.830> you<00:01:30.010> have<00:01:30.160> the<00:01:30.310> cylinder<00:01:30.640> in<00:01:30.940> you<00:01:31.690> notice

once you have the cylinder in you notice

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:35.610 
once you have the cylinder in you notice
that<00:01:32.370> by<00:01:33.370> just<00:01:33.640> putting<00:01:33.850> it<00:01:34.120> in<00:01:34.300> the<00:01:35.110> cylinder

that by just putting it in the cylinder

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:37.740 
that by just putting it in the cylinder
is<00:01:35.710> activating<00:01:36.400> without<00:01:37.000> using<00:01:37.420> the<00:01:37.540> lift

is activating without using the lift

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:40.860 
is activating without using the lift
lever<00:01:38.760> so<00:01:39.760> that<00:01:39.940> means<00:01:40.120> we<00:01:40.300> have<00:01:40.390> to<00:01:40.480> loosen

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:40.870 
lever so that means we have to loosen
