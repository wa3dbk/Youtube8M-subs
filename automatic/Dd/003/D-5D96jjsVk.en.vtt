00:00:00.599 --> 00:00:03.030
 FC St Pauli vs 11 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:09.410
 SV Duisburg Bundesliga 22 Stuhr August 2011 rare you weird you know outet 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:13.340
 the strange Kenzie means Dirk draw Anderlecht then encounter 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:17.340
 The fifth round of the second Bundesliga meet two teams 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.409
 at the beginning of the 

00:00:19.409 --> 00:00:22.199
 strangely the same to the Co now had 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.250
 but after four rounds they are not even the Kapellener together 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.130
 the host is as expected at the 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.859
 the top of the table 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:34.989
 Before this round he was even the chapel leader and when he was in this 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:38.890
 Duel victories should he again ascend the throne during the Duisburg 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:42.579
 the biggest disappointment in the current part of the season 

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:46.330
 they are in the relegation zone 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:54.990
 22 Straub US 2011 to 8:15 pm it's interesting that the last two duels 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:59.170
 these two rivals ended in a draw, both times 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:02.340

 award-winning bookmaker 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:11.890
 St Pauli is currently playing 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:14.070
 error-free in the championship 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.360
 "In the cup they packed maybe even on purpose 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.619
 they were already in the 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.030
 eliminated in the first round and they probably mourn this one 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.730
 Eliminate not much because the main objective in this 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:29.630
 Season is the return to the first league 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.020
 so far, everything is going according to plan 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.770
 In four rounds, they have only played a draw and that at the guest appearance 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:38.940
 against Eintracht Frankfurt 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:42.000
 is a great result given the 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.650
 Strength of the opponent 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:47.580
 at home they have without much trouble Ingoldstadt and Alemannia Aachen 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:52.390
 defeated their first away win on the final day of play 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:55.720
 very good team from Bochum have recorded 

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:59.630
 they scored at least one goal in every match 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.170
 in the distance they are also very dangerous 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:06.650
 just like last season, they have to return with the numerous 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:10.700
 Injuries fight but so far this has not affected the results 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:12.879
 negatively affected 

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:13.990
 since the beginning of 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:16.720
 As Rome they play without their most expensive defense 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.579
 Player Tooth 3 Mio 

00:02:18.579 --> 00:02:23.080
 it hurt the brilliant midfielder Marc dear after that 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:24.499
 Striker Ebbers 

00:02:24.499 --> 00:02:27.029
 on the last matchday one of the 

00:02:27.029 --> 00:02:29.819
 Player of the team Daggy injured 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:31.639
 as well was 

00:02:31.639 --> 00:02:35.579
 Excluded in the finish so that he is not in this duel 

00:02:36.969 --> 00:02:41.089
 Year that coach Schubert despite excellent results many problems 

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:41.839
 Has 

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:44.889
 in none of the players has the 

00:02:44.889 --> 00:02:46.579
 Setup started 

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:50.249
 In this encounter Hennings will play from the first minute 

00:02:50.939 --> 00:02:52.869
 replace al-beltagi 

00:02:52.869 --> 00:02:56.649
 Proudly defended and the rest of the team remains the same 

00:02:56.649 --> 00:02:58.279
 as in the book 

00:02:58.279 --> 00:03:02.019
 Most of the time you will drive again in the cruiser and Beuel which until now the 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:05.449
 Best single players have been expected 

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:06.909
 expected installation 

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:08.450
 St Pauli's position 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:09.170
 Shauna 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:12.499
 Rothenbach but to Sobiech Gomes 

00:03:12.499 --> 00:03:16.199
 Bartels Hennings could win Bruns Zach League 

00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:21.999
 Duisburg, in contrast to today's opponent has yet recorded a victory with 

00:03:21.999 --> 00:03:24.999
 Exception of the one in the Cup against Babelsberg 

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:29.369
 they can also be satisfied because they have two draws after two defeats 

00:03:29.369 --> 00:03:34.699
 recorded against FSV Frankfurt in the distance and against Hansa 

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:35.639
 in own 

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:36.669
 Stadion 

00:03:36.669 --> 00:03:41.729
 In these two duels, a new problem occurred around 2 inefficiency 

00:03:42.899 --> 00:03:46.949
 They scored three goals in the first two rounds and both became them 

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:51.239
 defeated while not scoring a single goal in the last two rounds 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:54.609
 and yet they were not beaten 

00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:59.169
 they just do not manage to become dominant and usually they are 

00:03:59.169 --> 00:04:02.009
 in a subordinate position 

00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:06.119
 Coach Sasic has against Frankfurt and against exactly the same lineup 

00:04:06.119 --> 00:04:07.969
 Hansa played and therefore 

00:04:07.969 --> 00:04:11.719
 It is not surprising and therefore the achievements were the same 

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:16.999
 In the for inefficiency they should be in the injuries of the two strikers 

00:04:16.999 --> 00:04:21.289
 Jule and Baljak are looking for but these problems can begin theirs 

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:25.459
 Opponents have not been compared because this is the only failure 

00:04:25.459 --> 00:04:26.960
 Duisburg are 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:30.750
 so this is probably the same crew as in the last 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:33.539
 Send two rounds to the field 

00:04:33.539 --> 00:04:35.060
 expected installation 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:36.350
 Position Duisburg 

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:37.430
 Fromlowitz 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:40.919
 Breulmann being League Bruno Soares Berberovic 

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:42.889
 so Carlo Pliatsikas 

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:45.889
 Boltze yes Solar Rosinski 

00:04:46.909 --> 00:04:51.879
 Given what both teams have done so far, we could easily 

00:04:51.879 --> 00:04:55.189
 predict the victory of the host 

00:04:55.189 --> 00:04:59.509
 however, we must not ignore numerous injuries, especially 

00:04:59.509 --> 00:05:02.389
 the latest from Takyi 

00:05:02.389 --> 00:05:06.889
 Schachter is suspended for this game and that will certainly be negative 

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:09.550
 Game of St. Pauli 

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:12.930
 on the other discounters will be satisfied with a draw 

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:18.170
 That's why we think this will be a tough game and not 

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:19.710
 especially attractive
