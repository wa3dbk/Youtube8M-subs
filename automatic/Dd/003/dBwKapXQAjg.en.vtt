00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:04.720 
here guys I just built the trolling

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:07.470 
here guys I just built the trolling
motor<00:00:04.810> mount<00:00:05.320> I<00:00:05.620> got<00:00:06.520> the<00:00:06.640> men<00:00:06.820> Kota<00:00:07.120> 30

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:07.480

motor mount I got the men Kota 30
pounder<00:00:07.930> thrust<00:00:08.650> and<00:00:09.219> we<00:00:09.669> did<00:00:10.389> a<00:00:10.419> steering

00:00:10.919 --> 00:00:10.929 
pounder thrust and we did a steering

00:00:10.929 --> 00:00:13.890 
pounder thrust and we did a steering
mechanism<00:00:11.879> that<00:00:12.879> goes<00:00:13.030> up<00:00:13.269> through<00:00:13.299> two<00:00:13.869> eye

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:13.900 
mechanism that goes up through two eye

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:15.839 
mechanism that goes up through two eye
eyelets<00:00:14.679> and<00:00:14.860> we'll<00:00:15.309> get<00:00:15.459> to<00:00:15.579> that<00:00:15.610> in<00:00:15.730> a

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:15.849 
eyelets and we'll get to that in a

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:16.230 
eyelets and we'll get to that in a
minute

first things first here's what I caught
our<00:00:18.039> complications<00:00:18.730> whirring<00:00:19.000> originally

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:19.420 
our complications whirring originally

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:21.480 
our complications whirring originally
this<00:00:20.199> piece<00:00:20.410> of<00:00:20.560> wood<00:00:20.679> wasn't<00:00:21.130> strong<00:00:21.429> enough

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:21.490 
this piece of wood wasn't strong enough

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:24.240 
this piece of wood wasn't strong enough
with<00:00:22.119> screws<00:00:22.539> in<00:00:22.779> it<00:00:22.929> so<00:00:23.500> we<00:00:23.619> come<00:00:23.769> around<00:00:23.890> here

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:24.250 
with screws in it so we come around here

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:29.040 
with screws in it so we come around here
we<00:00:24.400> got<00:00:24.580> a<00:00:25.949> angle<00:00:26.949> iron<00:00:27.220> and<00:00:27.609> four<00:00:28.269> quarter

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:29.050 
we got a angle iron and four quarter

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:31.620 
we got a angle iron and four quarter
inch<00:00:29.199> nuts<00:00:29.560> and<00:00:29.890> actually<00:00:30.849> mounted<00:00:31.509> it<00:00:31.599> and

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:31.630 
inch nuts and actually mounted it and

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:33.600 
inch nuts and actually mounted it and
screwed<00:00:32.110> it<00:00:32.259> and<00:00:32.410> glued<00:00:32.950> it<00:00:33.100> with<00:00:33.250> Gorilla

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:33.610 
screwed it and glued it with Gorilla

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:35.279 
screwed it and glued it with Gorilla
Glue<00:00:33.910> and<00:00:34.120> if<00:00:34.360> you<00:00:34.450> come<00:00:34.629> around<00:00:34.750> back<00:00:35.079> here

00:00:35.279 --> 00:00:35.289 
Glue and if you come around back here

00:00:35.289 --> 00:00:36.810 
Glue and if you come around back here
you<00:00:35.440> can<00:00:35.559> see<00:00:35.710> where<00:00:35.860> the<00:00:35.920> glue<00:00:36.129> glue<00:00:36.700> is

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:36.820 
you can see where the glue glue is

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:38.549 
you can see where the glue glue is
actually<00:00:37.180> coming<00:00:37.450> back<00:00:37.480> out<00:00:37.780> first<00:00:38.350> time

00:00:38.549 --> 00:00:38.559 
actually coming back out first time

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:39.979 
actually coming back out first time
trying<00:00:38.860> it<00:00:39.010> so<00:00:39.250> hopefully<00:00:39.520> it<00:00:39.610> works<00:00:39.760> well

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
trying it so hopefully it works well

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.119 
trying it so hopefully it works well
came<00:00:40.989> across<00:00:41.230> a<00:00:41.320> little<00:00:41.559> problem<00:00:42.100> with

00:00:42.119 --> 00:00:42.129 
came across a little problem with

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:44.400 
came across a little problem with
cutting<00:00:42.579> out<00:00:42.640> the<00:00:42.879> angle<00:00:43.480> so<00:00:43.930> we<00:00:44.020> had<00:00:44.170> to<00:00:44.260> add<00:00:44.379> a

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:44.410 
cutting out the angle so we had to add a

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:48.869 
cutting out the angle so we had to add a
second<00:00:44.920> board<00:00:45.359> all<00:00:46.359> right<00:00:47.309> the<00:00:48.309> motor<00:00:48.579> mount

00:00:48.869 --> 00:00:48.879 
second board all right the motor mount

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:51.660 
second board all right the motor mount
is<00:00:49.379> mounted<00:00:50.379> with<00:00:50.590> two<00:00:50.680> rope<00:00:51.039> cleats<00:00:51.370> through

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:51.670 
is mounted with two rope cleats through

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:55.080 
is mounted with two rope cleats through
these<00:00:51.789> you<00:00:52.000> clamps<00:00:52.420> right<00:00:52.600> here<00:00:53.850> one<00:00:54.850> on<00:00:54.969> each

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:55.090 
these you clamps right here one on each

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:57.209 
these you clamps right here one on each
side<00:00:55.120> same<00:00:55.629> same<00:00:55.899> and<00:00:56.469> what's<00:00:57.039> going<00:00:57.160> to

00:00:57.209 --> 00:00:57.219 
side same same and what's going to

00:00:57.219 --> 00:00:58.709 
side same same and what's going to
happen<00:00:57.309> is<00:00:57.609> your<00:00:57.730> battery<00:00:58.059> box<00:00:58.210> will<00:00:58.480> actually

00:00:58.709 --> 00:00:58.719 
happen is your battery box will actually

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:00.900 
happen is your battery box will actually
mount<00:00:58.899> right<00:00:59.170> here<00:00:59.230> all<00:01:00.039> out<00:01:00.340> of<00:01:00.370> the<00:01:00.519> way<00:01:00.640> all

rear<00:01:01.590> steerage<00:01:02.590> poundage<00:01:03.129> so<00:01:03.910> and<00:01:04.269> then<00:01:04.900> what

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:05.080 
rear steerage poundage so and then what

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:06.960 
rear steerage poundage so and then what
we<00:01:05.229> did<00:01:05.379> is<00:01:05.439> I<00:01:05.740> ran<00:01:05.950> a<00:01:05.979> carriage<00:01:06.520> bolt<00:01:06.790> through

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:06.970 
we did is I ran a carriage bolt through

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:10.320 
we did is I ran a carriage bolt through
where<00:01:07.960> I<00:01:07.990> put<00:01:08.320> my<00:01:08.350> hand<00:01:08.950> handle<00:01:09.549> and<00:01:09.729> took<00:01:10.210> the

where I put my hand handle and took the

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:12.660 
where I put my hand handle and took the
handle<00:01:10.689> out<00:01:10.869> and<00:01:11.140> I<00:01:11.590> put<00:01:11.770> a<00:01:11.799> piece<00:01:11.979> of<00:01:12.100> PVC<00:01:12.250> in

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:12.670 
handle out and I put a piece of PVC in

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:14.280 
handle out and I put a piece of PVC in
here<00:01:12.790> to<00:01:12.880> keep<00:01:13.000> everything<00:01:13.299> level<00:01:13.600> which<00:01:14.170> it

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:14.290 
here to keep everything level which it

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:15.719 
here to keep everything level which it
looks<00:01:14.439> like<00:01:14.560> I<00:01:14.680> may<00:01:14.920> have<00:01:14.950> to<00:01:15.220> raise<00:01:15.430> it<00:01:15.670> a

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:15.729 
looks like I may have to raise it a

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:17.010 
looks like I may have to raise it a
little<00:01:15.939> bit<00:01:16.150> but<00:01:16.299> that's<00:01:16.450> why<00:01:16.570> I<00:01:16.600> bought<00:01:16.869> such

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:17.020

a<00:01:17.049> long<00:01:17.259> stick<00:01:17.590> bolt<00:01:17.979> so<00:01:18.369> I<00:01:18.430> can<00:01:18.549> keep<00:01:18.729> this

00:01:18.929 --> 00:01:18.939 
a long stick bolt so I can keep this

00:01:18.939 --> 00:01:22.710 
a long stick bolt so I can keep this
level<00:01:19.390> alright<00:01:20.320> and<00:01:20.710> then<00:01:21.369> what<00:01:21.520> we<00:01:21.670> did<00:01:21.880> is<00:01:22.119> we

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:22.720 
level alright and then what we did is we

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.109 
level alright and then what we did is we
got<00:01:22.960> our<00:01:22.990> depth<00:01:23.409> right<00:01:23.680> by<00:01:24.490> using<00:01:24.759> the<00:01:24.909> depth

00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:25.119 
got our depth right by using the depth

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:28.350 
got our depth right by using the depth
gauge<00:01:25.210> here<00:01:25.750> and<00:01:25.960> what<00:01:26.710> I<00:01:26.950> learned<00:01:27.670> on<00:01:27.820> YouTube

all right now left right or you can go
side<00:02:24.120> to<00:02:24.150> side<00:02:24.300> with<00:02:24.660> your<00:02:24.780> hands<00:02:24.960> and<00:02:25.140> don't

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
side to side with your hands and don't

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.680 
side to side with your hands and don't
really<00:02:25.440> at<00:02:25.770> this<00:02:25.920> point<00:02:26.010> it<00:02:26.280> doesn't<00:02:26.550> really

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
really at this point it doesn't really

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:29.390 
really at this point it doesn't really
it's<00:02:27.690> kind<00:02:27.930> of<00:02:28.020> like<00:02:28.170> personal<00:02:28.980> comfort

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
it's kind of like personal comfort

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.290 
it's kind of like personal comfort
comfort<00:02:30.330> all<00:02:30.780> right<00:02:30.960> now<00:02:31.670> next<00:02:32.670> problem<00:02:33.180> that

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
comfort all right now next problem that

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.240 
comfort all right now next problem that
we<00:02:33.360> came<00:02:33.510> across<00:02:33.750> is<00:02:34.020> how<00:02:34.230> do<00:02:34.290> we<00:02:34.530> raise<00:02:34.920> the

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
we came across is how do we raise the

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.610 
we came across is how do we raise the
motor<00:02:35.490> from<00:02:35.910> the<00:02:35.970> cockpit<00:02:36.270> since<00:02:36.750> we<00:02:36.840> can't<00:02:37.080> we

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
motor from the cockpit since we can't we

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.040 
motor from the cockpit since we can't we
can't<00:02:37.860> reach<00:02:38.070> it<00:02:38.450> what<00:02:39.450> we<00:02:39.570> did<00:02:39.720> is<00:02:39.810> we<00:02:39.840> took

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
can't reach it what we did is we took

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:42.800 
can't reach it what we did is we took
the<00:02:40.170> locking<00:02:40.530> device<00:02:40.940> and<00:02:41.940> we<00:02:42.030> zip-tied<00:02:42.630> it

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
the locking device and we zip-tied it

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.710 
the locking device and we zip-tied it
because<00:02:42.990> I<00:02:43.080> wanted<00:02:43.440> the<00:02:43.590> motor<00:02:43.800> to<00:02:43.980> still<00:02:44.280> be

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720 
because I wanted the motor to still be

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.940 
because I wanted the motor to still be
completely<00:02:45.720> functional<00:02:46.020> when<00:02:46.530> I<00:02:46.560> was<00:02:46.770> done

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
completely functional when I was done

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.260 
completely functional when I was done
with<00:02:47.100> it<00:02:47.130> if<00:02:47.400> I<00:02:47.490> wanted<00:02:47.700> to<00:02:47.790> take<00:02:47.910> it<00:02:48.030> off<00:02:48.120> and

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.270 
with it if I wanted to take it off and

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:49.460 
with it if I wanted to take it off and
put<00:02:48.330> it<00:02:48.450> somewhere<00:02:48.720> else<00:02:48.960> or<00:02:49.110> sell<00:02:49.350> it

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
put it somewhere else or sell it

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.740 
put it somewhere else or sell it
whatever<00:02:49.680> so<00:02:50.430> I<00:02:50.460> just<00:02:50.670> zip-tied<00:02:51.060> that<00:02:51.270> locking

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
whatever so I just zip-tied that locking

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.530 
whatever so I just zip-tied that locking
mechanism<00:02:52.200> open<00:02:52.590> and<00:02:53.210> let<00:02:54.210> me<00:02:54.300> show<00:02:54.420> you<00:02:54.510> a

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
mechanism open and let me show you a

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.310 
mechanism open and let me show you a
demonstration<00:02:54.810> the<00:02:55.620> weight<00:02:55.950> of<00:02:56.220> the<00:02:56.340> motor

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:57.320 
demonstration the weight of the motor

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:01.940 
demonstration the weight of the motor
will<00:02:58.320> always<00:02:58.830> up<00:02:59.670> right<00:03:00.120> it<00:03:00.270> by<00:03:00.750> itself<00:03:01.080> all

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
will always up right it by itself all

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.790 
will always up right it by itself all
right<00:03:02.100> so<00:03:03.050> to<00:03:04.050> raise<00:03:04.200> the<00:03:04.440> motor

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:04.800 
right so to raise the motor

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:08.180 
right so to raise the motor
I<00:03:05.630> got<00:03:06.630> a<00:03:06.660> carabiner<00:03:07.110> right<00:03:07.380> here<00:03:07.710> now<00:03:08.100> I'm

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
I got a carabiner right here now I'm

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:13.640 
I got a carabiner right here now I'm
going<00:03:08.340> to<00:03:08.400> actually<00:03:08.730> hook<00:03:08.940> to<00:03:09.540> my<00:03:09.810> kayak

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:16.229 

now<00:03:14.650> let's<00:03:15.310> look<00:03:15.459> at<00:03:15.580> the<00:03:15.700> motor<00:03:15.879> I'll<00:03:16.060> show

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:16.239 
now let's look at the motor I'll show

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:18.929 
now let's look at the motor I'll show
you<00:03:16.299> how<00:03:16.390> it's<00:03:16.540> going<00:03:16.659> to<00:03:16.720> go<00:03:16.840> up<00:03:17.519> I'm<00:03:18.519> turning

00:03:18.929 --> 00:03:18.939 
you how it's going to go up I'm turning

00:03:18.939 --> 00:03:21.289 
you how it's going to go up I'm turning
it<00:03:19.060> slightly<00:03:19.480> pulling<00:03:19.989> it<00:03:20.230> pulling<00:03:20.260> it

00:03:21.289 --> 00:03:21.299 
it slightly pulling it pulling it

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:29.970 
it slightly pulling it pulling it
turning<00:03:22.299> it<00:03:27.329> and<00:03:28.329> that's<00:03:28.480> it<00:03:28.810> now<00:03:29.769> I<00:03:29.799> can

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:29.980 
turning it and that's it now I can

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:31.350 
turning it and that's it now I can
do<00:03:30.069> a<00:03:30.099> better<00:03:30.340> sitting<00:03:30.670> down<00:03:30.790> I'm<00:03:30.940> standing<00:03:31.239> up

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:31.360 
do a better sitting down I'm standing up

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:32.940 
do a better sitting down I'm standing up
right<00:03:31.420> now<00:03:31.690> and<00:03:31.989> then<00:03:32.319> I'll<00:03:32.409> just<00:03:32.590> basically

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:32.950 
right now and then I'll just basically

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:34.740 
right now and then I'll just basically
leash<00:03:33.250> this<00:03:33.489> and<00:03:33.760> let<00:03:34.299> the<00:03:34.420> weight<00:03:34.569> of<00:03:34.599> the

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750 
leash this and let the weight of the

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:36.930 
leash this and let the weight of the
motor<00:03:34.930> just<00:03:35.019> kind<00:03:35.319> of<00:03:35.379> settle<00:03:35.739> like<00:03:35.890> that<00:03:36.099> so

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:36.940 
motor just kind of settle like that so

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:39.420 
motor just kind of settle like that so
this<00:03:37.090> is<00:03:37.239> leashed<00:03:37.480> the<00:03:38.230> motors<00:03:38.590> here<00:03:38.920> and<00:03:39.099> it's

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
this is leashed the motors here and it's

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:42.000 
this is leashed the motors here and it's
clearing<00:03:39.970> this<00:03:40.120> no<00:03:40.390> problem<00:03:40.870> we're<00:03:41.829> out<00:03:41.980> of

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
clearing this no problem we're out of

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:44.190 
clearing this no problem we're out of
the<00:03:42.189> water<00:03:42.430> the<00:03:43.000> battery<00:03:43.390> box<00:03:43.510> will<00:03:43.780> still<00:03:44.019> not

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:44.200 
the water the battery box will still not

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.729 
the water the battery box will still not
be<00:03:44.230> affected<00:03:44.769> by<00:03:44.920> any<00:03:45.190> of<00:03:45.310> this<00:03:45.659> so<00:03:46.659> that's<00:03:47.560> the

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:47.739 
be affected by any of this so that's the

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:50.819 
be affected by any of this so that's the
