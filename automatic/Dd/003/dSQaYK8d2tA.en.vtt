00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:07.850
 christmas the period that everyone expects 

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:10.730
 every year I have prepared you 

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:12.410
 today a little tutorial just 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:14.960
 for the end of the year holidays that this 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:17.180
 either Christmas or New Year so we are 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:19.340
 party I'm going to start by applying 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:21.590
 a base he has shadow insurance of 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:24.500
 all faced in order to fit my 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:26.330
 lighthouses all night so I apply 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.100
 on the eyelid and how far 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:29.750
 source 

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:31.670
 then I'll take the film palette 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:33.440
 black of summer lauder and i'm going 

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:36.229
 start by taking the color white 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:38.030
 and apply it exactly where I have 

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:41.510
 applied my base to create a kind of 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:44.479
 second phase with the gel liner and meaning 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:46.819
 I'm going to make a cat eye liner 

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:49.459
 with a whore and 10.1 I start with 

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:52.369
 just draw a simple trait really at 

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:54.769
 flush her eyelashes and I'm going 

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:57.079
 also in the inner corner and 

00:00:54.769 --> 00:01:00.170
 then I create my little comma 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:03.350
 aiming for the tip of my eyebrows that I 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:05.990
 brings the line back to the liner so makes a 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:08.270
 sort of triangle that you run through 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:11.550
 following with the liner and I do the same 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.870
 on the second 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:14.900
 seguin 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:14.900
 m 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.010
 ap hugo 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.299
 an airplane 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:29.100
 so that's what it gives 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.830
 back to the palette I do take the 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:35.100
 silvery go for summer I'm going 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:36.659
 use to blur this liner create a 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.460
 sort of effect a little bit this word that 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:42.390
 is I will also lead her into the 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:44.070
 hollow I use a beveled brush of 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.869
 at sigma I think it's more 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.740
 practical because it's really accurate for 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.990
 apply color 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.340
 take the time you need, of course 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.890
 do not hurry for this step 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.080
 you put in an external corner on 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:58.920
 the foot and the liner is hollow and 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:00.240
 we fade of course not all sounds 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.369
 the being is of importance made us eight 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.030
 dead so that's what it gives my 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.039
 once dimmed 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.979
 I keep the same palette and I will 

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:09.989
 take the silver lighter on the finger 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:12.480
 and unfortunately it's blurry but I 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:14.730
 will apply it on the middle of the 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.739
 eyelid and I'm just blurred towards 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.900
 inside to the inner corner 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:20.700
 that's pretty much what it gives and with 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.440
 a your eye liner brush I come 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.810
 take the black out of the palette and I'm going 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.580
 just iron this liner since 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.160
 the silver went on so this one 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:31.140
 little erased I take the silver 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:34.220
 do not go summer and I just put 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.220
 lower eyelashes 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.799
 and I take back the silvered clearer than 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:42.110
 I also come to put on the eye lashes 

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:45.530
 lower but this time from the corner 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.670
 internal in the center then with my finger 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:48.230
 always i will learn the color 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:49.970
 white and I'm going to apply in 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:56.239
 highlight ie just under the 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:59.299
 eyebrow and in inner corner and then 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:01.010
 stage fun the fossils and yes first 

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:04.159
 video with fossils that I use 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:06.470
 the glue duo to paste but fossils 

00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:09.459
 are false eyelashes that I found at 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:12.379
 nocibe seems to me and it's naturalness 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:14.060
 natural I do not know too much and this is the 

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:16.519
 range wanted but are they are really 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:18.170
 very thin and it really does it remains 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:19.670
 natural in fact sajjad ie 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:21.260
 it brings volume and length but 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:23.209
 it's really natural it's not the 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:25.790
 costs even more fossils than the whole 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:27.829
 world remark I'm applying with my forceps 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:30.379
 to depilate and especially take your time 

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:31.970
 do not panic the glue while drying 

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:33.980
 becomes transparent so that does not 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:37.519
 will not come back your makeup and that's it 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:39.049
 what does that give with fossils to 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:41.000
 there is a small point that is not well 

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:43.970
 then stick for the bioderma lotion 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.280
 and I come to remove the falls that there are 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:48.260
 could have lighthouses that's why 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:50.690
 besides that I made my complexion fair 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:52.310
 after and I take the black pencil glued 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:58.639
 maybelline contours that I come 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:04:00.739
 placed in the neck then I 

00:03:58.639 --> 00:04:03.530
 take my mascara loose blast volume of 

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:06.470
 covergirl that you surely know to 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:09.829
 force and I come to apply it to make 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:12.310
 melt the fossils and but true if they 

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:12.310
 enter 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:20.650
 jeans but also on the scenes 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:22.960
 inside and then we'll go to 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:24.280
 complexion that I do in second for 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:27.040
 precisely that they are not ruined 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:29.020
 by the falls of my makeup so I 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:31.510
 start by applying my base which is 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:33.070
 La laura mercier for him fruit I 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:34.900
 I apply on your face and no 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:37.660
 basket I 'm getting red that's normal 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:39.280
 mapou and sensitive precisely for there 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:41.860
 remedy and I use the corrector 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:43.030
 green chanel that I apply on all 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:44.920
 the areas where I can be a red light 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:48.550
 my acne scars what kind of things 

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:50.680
 and then I'm faded on the finger and then 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:52.510
 I use foundation lancÃ´me complexion 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:53.440
 miracle that I come out since these 

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:55.090
 winter mornings 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:57.760
 I do not know why he does it too 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:05:00.040
 yellow on the video that's enough 

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:03.190
 weird but it's my skin tone and 

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:06.280
 it's yellow precisely to fade 

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:08.200
 redness and I use the corrector fit 

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:10.780
 maybelline mine that I just involved 

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:14.460
 on my dark circles and also on the 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:14.460
 redness that can stay 

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:23.500
 so here I apply on the redness and then 

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:25.600
 i take the fail bim of beneficial which 

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:31.060
 is a liquid illuminator and placed 

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:33.100
 just years old and on the bone of mean fast and I 

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:35.440
 So just dimmed the finger and then 

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:36.930
 I go powdered with the belote by their 

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:38.919

 gemma for every day that we can 

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:43.800

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:45.880

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:53.260
 on my dark circles 

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:55.210
 that's not it sounds weird 

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:57.940
 but in fact it is that reflects the 

00:05:55.210 --> 00:06:00.280
 light so that held my dark circles and 

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:01.510
