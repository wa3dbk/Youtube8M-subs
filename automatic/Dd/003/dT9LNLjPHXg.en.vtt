elevation change in that short amount of

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:42.300 
elevation change in that short amount of
time<00:02:40.359> I<00:02:40.450> mean<00:02:40.690> the<00:02:40.810> corkscrew<00:02:41.410> you<00:02:42.100> might

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
time I mean the corkscrew you might

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.160 
time I mean the corkscrew you might
compare<00:02:42.819> it<00:02:43.060> to<00:02:43.150> a<00:02:43.180> little<00:02:43.389> bit<00:02:43.600> but<00:02:43.930> you<00:02:44.049> know

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
compare it to a little bit but you know

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:46.500 
compare it to a little bit but you know
this<00:02:44.410> this<00:02:44.709> is<00:02:44.950> definitely<00:02:45.400> sets<00:02:45.940> it<00:02:46.060> apart<00:02:46.150> in

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
this this is definitely sets it apart in

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:47.910 
this this is definitely sets it apart in
it<00:02:46.660> and<00:02:46.810> the<00:02:46.870> brake<00:02:47.139> and<00:02:47.290> the<00:02:47.380> hard<00:02:47.590> braking

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
it and the brake and the hard braking

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.050 
it and the brake and the hard braking
you<00:02:47.950> can<00:02:48.130> do<00:02:48.250> up<00:02:48.489> that<00:02:48.519> hill

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
you can do up that hill

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:58.690 
you can do up that hill
you<00:02:49.630> can<00:02:49.780> brake<00:02:49.959> so<00:02:50.200> late<00:02:50.410> it<00:02:50.590> just<00:02:50.799> doesn't

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.910 

think<00:02:59.270> about<00:02:59.390> those<00:02:59.540> s<00:02:59.750> is<00:02:59.930> is<00:03:00.080> connect<00:03:00.830> the

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 
think about those s is is connect the

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.490 
think about those s is is connect the
dots<00:03:01.130> as<00:03:01.430> long<00:03:01.760> as<00:03:01.940> you're<00:03:02.060> smooth<00:03:02.540> and<00:03:03.140> you're

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 
dots as long as you're smooth and you're

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.170 
dots as long as you're smooth and you're
carrying<00:03:03.860> the<00:03:03.950> speed<00:03:04.190> you<00:03:04.340> can<00:03:04.460> care<00:03:04.610> what

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
carrying the speed you can care what

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:07.360 
carrying the speed you can care what
you'll<00:03:05.360> find<00:03:05.510> you<00:03:05.720> try<00:03:05.870> to<00:03:05.930> carry<00:03:06.260> half<00:03:07.250> a

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
you'll find you try to carry half a

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:09.010 
you'll find you try to carry half a
kilometer<00:03:07.760> war<00:03:07.970> speed<00:03:08.330> and<00:03:08.630> you're<00:03:08.900> just

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:09.020 
kilometer war speed and you're just

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:10.750 
kilometer war speed and you're just
gonna<00:03:09.110> push<00:03:09.410> the<00:03:09.530> front<00:03:09.800> and<00:03:09.920> run<00:03:10.010> out<00:03:10.160> what<00:03:10.400> so

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 
gonna push the front and run out what so

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.790 
gonna push the front and run out what so
you<00:03:11.420> can<00:03:11.450> lose<00:03:11.810> a<00:03:11.840> lot<00:03:11.990> of<00:03:12.140> time<00:03:12.350> if<00:03:12.500> you<00:03:12.590> make<00:03:12.770> a

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:12.800 
you can lose a lot of time if you make a

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:14.920 
you can lose a lot of time if you make a

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:25.760 
it getting a drive getting it stood up

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.150 
it getting a drive getting it stood up
sitting<00:03:26.570> at<00:03:26.690> the<00:03:26.750> power<00:03:26.900> on<00:03:27.080> early<00:03:27.410> you<00:03:28.040> know

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:28.160 
sitting at the power on early you know

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:29.560 
sitting at the power on early you know
you<00:03:28.220> can<00:03:28.430> make<00:03:28.610> four<00:03:28.880> bike<00:03:29.090> lengths<00:03:29.360> off<00:03:29.480> the

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:29.570 
you can make four bike lengths off the

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:31.600 
you can make four bike lengths off the
corner<00:03:29.959> but<00:03:30.170> you<00:03:30.830> might<00:03:31.010> be<00:03:31.130> able<00:03:31.190> to<00:03:31.280> make<00:03:31.430> up

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:31.610 
corner but you might be able to make up

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:33.699 
corner but you might be able to make up
a<00:03:31.700> bike<00:03:31.940> length<00:03:32.180> a<00:03:32.450> little<00:03:32.690> bit<00:03:32.900> off<00:03:33.080> line<00:03:33.410> in

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:33.709 
a bike length a little bit off line in

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:35.020 
a bike length a little bit off line in
some<00:03:33.950> of<00:03:34.040> those<00:03:34.100> corners<00:03:34.610> so<00:03:34.760> you're<00:03:34.880> really

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.030 
some of those corners so you're really

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:36.910 
some of those corners so you're really
thinking<00:03:35.180> about<00:03:35.510> the<00:03:35.780> ultimate<00:03:36.080> goal<00:03:36.350> is<00:03:36.680> get

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:36.920 
thinking about the ultimate goal is get

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:41.110 
thinking about the ultimate goal is get
good<00:03:37.160> drive<00:03:37.430> off<00:03:37.610> onto<00:03:38.209> the<00:03:38.300> straight<00:03:40.120> motor

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.120 
good drive off onto the straight motor

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:42.760 
good drive off onto the straight motor
three<00:03:41.390> is<00:03:41.480> gonna<00:03:41.630> be<00:03:41.840> insane<00:03:42.170> yes

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:42.770 
three is gonna be insane yes

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:44.710 
three is gonna be insane yes
those<00:03:43.340> guys<00:03:43.520> are<00:03:43.700> straighten<00:03:44.030> so<00:03:44.180> long<00:03:44.450> they

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:44.720 
those guys are straighten so long they

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:46.300 
those guys are straighten so long they
can<00:03:44.870> actually<00:03:45.020> make<00:03:45.320> a<00:03:45.350> mistake<00:03:45.770> and<00:03:45.980> back<00:03:46.160> in

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:46.310 
can actually make a mistake and back in

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:49.000 
can actually make a mistake and back in
the<00:03:46.400> drive<00:03:46.670> and<00:03:46.970> pass<00:03:47.209> again<00:03:47.750> so<00:03:48.050> it's<00:03:48.709> one<00:03:48.920> of

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.010 
the drive and pass again so it's one of

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:50.440 
the drive and pass again so it's one of

those places to where you can dive up
the<00:03:50.720> inside<00:03:51.020> but<00:03:51.260> you<00:03:51.350> you<00:03:51.860> know<00:03:52.010> they're

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:52.130 
the inside but you you know they're

00:03:52.130 --> 00:04:05.960 
the inside but you you know they're
gonna<00:03:52.250> come<00:03:52.340> right<00:03:52.610> back<00:03:52.760> bike
