00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:07.770
 no no no no 

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:13.310
 hello everyone and welcome to a new 

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:15.770
 video today we are going to explain how 

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:18.890
 get a 3g connection with your 

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:21.880
 nexus 7 tablet although it is valid for 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:24.939
 any Android tablet that does not have 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:28.329
 3g connection that is only wifi for it 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:30.640
 let's use the wifi connection of a 

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:31.989
 mobile or the bluetooth that is to say we have 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.329
 two ways of doing the same now 

00:00:31.989 --> 00:00:36.340
 we will explain the difference we are going to 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:40.449
 use a samsung galaxy s2 with the 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:43.720
 version 4.0 of android and the nexus 7 that 

00:00:40.449 --> 00:00:45.850
 has the living 4.1 on the mobile for 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:50.649
 first method the wifi we are going to 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:52.440
 menu system settings plus anchor to 

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:56.590
 network and wifi zone 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:58.690
 we activated the portable wifi zone 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:01.890
 and on the table we go to the 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:01.890
 settings in settings 

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:10.250
 we press wifi and select our 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:13.680
 connection that in this case android app 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:16.950
 we say establish connection is 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:19.920
 establishing in the same configuring 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:22.520
 the ip and others and we already have the connection 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:25.840
 established let's try 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.840
 opening a post 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.720
 As you can see, it is loading quite fast 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:39.270
 and wifi as we say ss like 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.250
 we can check 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:45.420
 on the mobile the network appears anchored and 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:47.770
 wifi zone activated and wifi connection if 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.900
 we tested it 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:54.160
 it is android app 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:56.570
 another option to do this without resorting to 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:58.970
 Bluetooth and Wi-Fi forgiveness is with 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:02.130
 bluetooth for this we're going to turn off the 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:07.280
 wifi on it 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:07.280
 table we turn bluetooth 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:13.530
 and on the mobile we disable wifi zone 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:15.860
 portable and activate anchor 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.860
 bluetooth 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.950
 we go to the configuration of 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.950
 bluetooth 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:27.940
 and we have already paired nexus 7 with the 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:31.990
 Samsung Galaxy S2 whose code name 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:33.880
 of gt and 9,100 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:37.600
 how do we connect it in the 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:40.150
 options of this model we give you access 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:43.150
 Internet marking 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:46.569
 It was further back and we click on the 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:48.610
 name puts connected it turns on the 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:49.659
 bluetooth icon that was previously in 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:52.060
 gray simply because we have it 

00:02:49.659 --> 00:02:54.730
 activated but not connected and now if 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:58.860
 we go back to the browser as 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:03:00.780
 We can try another address 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.980
 As you can see, the connection is slower than 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:05.319
 by wifi 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:08.260
 but that also has an advantage and that 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:12.040
 consumes less battery ie when the 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:14.379
 priority be the vega the battery the 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:18.660
 consumption instead of speed we can 

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:21.780
 use the bluetooth connection to 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:24.090
 to have data on the tablet without 3g 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:26.510
 As you can see, the load is the same 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:26.510
 slow 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:33.450
 not too much but something slower so 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:35.130
 is and as we say we always have that 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:37.590
 option so that the option is also worth 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:40.860
 of bluetooth when software is 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:43.560
 layer gives the option to make the hotspot 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:45.330
 wifi if you have any questions although the 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.340
 manual is very simple you can not leave 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:49.440
 in the post I will try to help only 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:52.080
 say that this manual is also valid 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:54.270
 for other tablets as we say wifi that 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:55.950
 do not have 3g connection and mobiles 

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:57.990
 Android that support them also depends 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:01.790
 of the model and especially the version of 

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:01.790
 Android that has the mobile
