00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
was asleep so I thought it'd be a little

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.220 
was asleep so I thought it'd be a little
bit<00:00:35.160> selfish<00:00:35.550> if<00:00:35.670> I<00:00:35.820> did<00:00:36.030> I'm<00:00:36.780> just<00:00:36.960> randomly

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
bit selfish if I did I'm just randomly

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.110 
bit selfish if I did I'm just randomly
stopped<00:00:37.469> speaking<00:00:37.739> so<00:00:38.550> instead<00:00:38.969> I<00:00:39.090> just

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
stopped speaking so instead I just

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.700 
stopped speaking so instead I just
thought<00:00:39.420> to<00:00:39.540> do<00:00:39.600> it<00:00:39.660> the<00:00:39.750> next<00:00:39.870> day<00:00:40.050> and<00:00:40.469> she

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
thought to do it the next day and she

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.729 
thought to do it the next day and she
said<00:00:40.890> it<00:00:40.980> in<00:00:41.100> so<00:00:41.340> but<00:00:41.670> in<00:00:42.000> a<00:00:42.170> MIDI<00:00:43.170> Silpat<00:00:43.620> we've
