00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:08.410
 good as they are today I am going to make them a 

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:12.060
 kind of tutorial or how to put together a good 

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:16.170
 aquarium for semiaquatic turtles 

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:18.870
 a good sized fish tank to start 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.320
 this is a measure roughly 60 liters 

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:21.320
 they have 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.420
 I advise you once the 60 liter one 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:30.290
 mother 33 turtle 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:36.270
 now you can appreciate what I did was 

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:37.830
 gather sea beach stones and appealed 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.050
 on one side so they have the 

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:42.809
 enough place 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.180
 to walk I know that he likes to be 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.420
 outside and inside the water almost as much 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.420
 same 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.040
 when the water part a 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:58.340
 on the ground so you can swim 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.340
 freely 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.790
 we can see they have no drama 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.410
 in living with tropical fish 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:09.870
 so that when it's bigger if what 

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:12.930
 want to eat but now but good 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:14.560
 good fundamental stressed the piece 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:18.340
 principal 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:20.110
 in this aquarium is the filter without filter 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:22.750
 they can not have turtles because they are going to 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:25.119
 be changing in the water every 34 days 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:27.340
 but with this filter I change the 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:30.130
 good is a month yes because if I want 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:32.860
 I can have 22 months because I do not 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:35.960
 I ask for the water nothing the filter is 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:38.900
 the week pretty 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:40.659
 the heater key as the 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:43.350
 turtles with cold water do not eat 

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:48.420
 keep it between 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:49.979
 between 24 and 28 degrees 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.150
 with warm water is turtles going to 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:54.860
 eat 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:57.820
 good as you can see my 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:59.590
 it is not much not so much 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:02.440
 but with this from the turtles you're 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:03.550
 Happy good theme that light I 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:05.240
 I'm using a common lamp and 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:07.729
 current 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:10.310
 because I have the fish tank next to the 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:14.930
 window that receives sunlight in the 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:17.660
 If they do not receive sunlight, they get 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:20.450
 half of ultraviolet 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:22.530
 and at least two hours a day 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.870
 tortures of the invader 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.440
 if they do not find themselves in trouble in the 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.780
 shell 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:31.520
 since they need the sun's vitamin not 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:34.240
 and also with merchandise 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:38.080
 and that white that is there 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:40.490
 it was a participation that was made 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:42.770
 and good 

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:46.100
 there's basically 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:50.620
 would be all the information for 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:50.620
 have these two happy and healthy
