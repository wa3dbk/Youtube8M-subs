00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
what I think are the pros and the cons

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.209 
what I think are the pros and the cons
of<00:00:28.800> having<00:00:29.070> a<00:00:29.340> pixie<00:00:30.060> do<00:00:30.210> pro<00:00:31.199> number<00:00:31.529> one<00:00:31.769> I've

in<00:00:44.190> life<00:00:44.370> and<00:00:44.670> I<00:00:44.820> think<00:00:44.850> that's<00:00:45.329> a<00:00:45.480> good<00:00:45.629> thing

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
in life and I think that's a good thing

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.790 
in life and I think that's a good thing
I<00:00:46.170> have<00:00:46.800> had<00:00:47.039> long<00:00:47.460> hair<00:00:48.059> for<00:00:48.660> so<00:00:49.050> many<00:00:49.350> years

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
I have had long hair for so many years

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:55.610 
I have had long hair for so many years
so<00:00:50.370> I<00:00:51.329> really<00:00:52.969> don't<00:00:53.969> feel<00:00:54.270> like<00:00:54.510> a<00:00:54.750> new<00:00:54.960> person

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
so I really don't feel like a new person

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.849 
so I really don't feel like a new person
the<00:00:56.219> second<00:00:56.730> Pro<00:00:56.910> is<00:00:57.239> that<00:00:57.270> I<00:00:57.690> could<00:00:58.140> try<00:00:58.530> new

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
the second Pro is that I could try new

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.770 
the second Pro is that I could try new
things<00:00:58.890> like<00:01:00.260> funky<00:01:01.260> styles<00:01:01.859> with<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:02.850> hair

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
things like funky styles with the hair

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.720 
things like funky styles with the hair
wax<00:01:04.530> just<00:01:05.040> you<00:01:05.280> can<00:01:05.460> do

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:08.730 

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:12.149 

the<00:01:09.730> third<00:01:10.350> proves<00:01:11.350> the<00:01:11.590> fact<00:01:11.620> that<00:01:11.890> there's

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:12.159 
the third proves the fact that there's

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:15.540 
the third proves the fact that there's
less<00:01:12.340> fixing<00:01:12.850> time<00:01:13.060> I<00:01:13.560> basically<00:01:14.560> have<00:01:15.130> to

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:15.550 
less fixing time I basically have to

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:18.390 
less fixing time I basically have to
just<00:01:15.820> blow<00:01:16.180> dry<00:01:16.570> a<00:01:16.870> bit<00:01:16.900> of<00:01:17.290> my<00:01:17.440> bags<00:01:17.710> and<00:01:18.220> then

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:18.400 
just blow dry a bit of my bags and then

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:24.410 
just blow dry a bit of my bags and then
the<00:01:18.520> rest<00:01:18.790> I<00:01:19.000> just<00:01:19.180> do<00:01:19.360> this<00:01:22.350> and<00:01:23.350> I<00:01:23.920> look<00:01:24.070> okay

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
the rest I just do this and I look okay

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.350 
the rest I just do this and I look okay
one<00:01:25.420> Pro<00:01:25.690> I<00:01:25.930> think<00:01:26.290> that<00:01:26.740> people<00:01:27.070> with<00:01:28.060> short

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:28.360 
one Pro I think that people with short

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.290 
one Pro I think that people with short
hair<00:01:28.660> take<00:01:29.080> for<00:01:29.350> granted<00:01:29.560> is<00:01:30.520> the<00:01:31.060> backup

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:31.300 
hair take for granted is the backup

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:36.480 
hair take for granted is the backup
breeze<00:01:32.400> nothing<00:01:33.400> feels<00:01:34.300> better<00:01:35.100> and<00:01:36.100> a<00:01:36.220> breeze

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:36.490 
breeze nothing feels better and a breeze

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:40.109 
breeze nothing feels better and a breeze
in<00:01:37.300> your<00:01:37.360> bottle<00:01:38.040> the<00:01:39.040> best<00:01:39.340> thing<00:01:39.700> about

in your bottle the best thing about
having<00:01:40.750> short<00:01:41.229> hair<00:01:41.320> is<00:01:41.979> the<00:01:42.310> fact<00:01:42.550> that<00:01:42.670> you

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:42.940 
having short hair is the fact that you

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:47.160 
having short hair is the fact that you
can<00:01:43.180> look<00:01:43.450> under<00:01:43.720> honest<00:01:44.470> I<00:01:44.789> can<00:01:45.789> finally<00:01:46.509> pull
