00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:10.530
 beauty talks to you 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.210
 in today's video I wanted to go 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.190
 for you a technique I 'm using 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.990
 recently and I'm enjoying the 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.650
 result so I'll share with 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.880
 you 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.810
 first I have to go to 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:23.160
 You who want to make muscle is a tissue. 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:25.680
 connective tissue that surrounds the 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.970
 our whole body and it ends up compressed 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.150
 our musculature 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:32.489
 so it somehow limits our 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.829
 muscle growth because it took time to 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.809
 a little to stretch does not grow the same 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.000
 it does not follow the same rhythm as 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.800
 growth of our muscles so 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.360
 it is easier for you to recover your 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.040
 measured from what you get there by 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.039
 first time because beyond memory 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.200
 Your easy muscle will already be a 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:52.620
 little more elongated a little more ti 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.270
 cadu then the muscle he will be more 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.280
 free will have a larger space for 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:01:00.149
 grow to be developed 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.829
 so if you stretch your easy you 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:05.070
 can speed up your 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:07.799
 results and this you can achieve 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.350
 through punk that is nothing more than a 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:12.590
 increase an excess of blood in your 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:16.710
 muscle tissue we went there shift 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:18.299
 this technique is the basis of the training fsp 7 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.520
 I'm just not going to go into details about 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.860
 Because it's a hardcore workout it 's a 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.240
 training for those who train for more 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.509
 two years 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:30.060
 I do not train, but I use the technique. 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:33.299
 that actually closes the training with a key 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:35.640
 of gold between act the bambi it finishes 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:38.009
 forcing you to stretch 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.299
 so it leaves a better space for the 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:42.990
 musician grew up 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:44.939
 you can cause a larger dot at the end 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.070
 of your workout you do not support this 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:49.710
 doing chest I do four exercises 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:54.060
 for pm then make the first three and 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:56.700
 last exercise I take an insulator one 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.890
 exercise joins preferably 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.360
 on the machine so you can concentrate more 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.840
 in making force 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:08.250
 insulating exercises can be flying 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:10.229
 mondal pink scot in machine single strings 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:13.319
 Flexora tensioners 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:16.260
 then you will make it more serious in case 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:17.760
 stf and seven are seven final series and 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:21.840
 I do it too 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:24.239
 you use 7 sets with 12 8 repetitions or 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.280
 until the concentric failure only you go 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:29.400
 give your muscles a smaller rest 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:31.200
 of 30 seconds or less of rest 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.269
 it is logical that you have a breadth 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.879
 you will have to reduce the load 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:38.280
 is normal and beyond the series is also very 

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:39.989
 important you make a stretch here 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.000
 5 to 10 seconds 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:42.720
 in fact you do not have to chase the 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.269
 punk 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:47.040
 it's not because you're with 11 big 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:49.709
 You trained well what you did not have 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:53.400
 you trained badly if that 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:55.109
 influence the hypertrophy you pick up 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.760
 a direct route put 10 15 pounds in 

00:02:55.109 --> 00:02:59.220
 do 50 repetitions 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.989
 you get a big point but for the 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:02.970
 hypertrophy was not something very 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:06.660
 significant was useful 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:08.640
 so try to reduce the rest time 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:12.780
 between series using a load 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:14.849
 acceptable and is not greatly increase the 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:17.790
 amount of repetitions greatly reducing 

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:19.440
 loading has no scientific evidence 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:22.049
 that the Pope helped in the growth 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.730
 only as a pump it is just an increase 

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:25.500
 of blood in the muscle 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:27.480
 if you have more blood you have a 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:29.220
 greater availability of carbohydrates 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:32.010
 proteins and nutrients 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:32.730
 then you will have a more 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.950
 fast 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:37.760
 furthermore if you sharpen your strength 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:41.069
 muscular you increase definition galera 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:42.780
 today is this very short 

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:45.180
 I wanted to ask you to use these 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:47.819
 tips with test intelligence and see if 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:50.579
 This works for you, I already added that 

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:53.040
 this is a rather heavy technique like 

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:54.030
 I train only one song once per 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.190
 week 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:59.040
 I was feeling a little stagnant. 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:59.940
 so I tried using this technique to exit 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:04.109
 this phase 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:07.349
 and when my training of btt ondoy the 

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:09.150
 menu of the day p hurts just will stop hurting 

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:12.510
 the other day when I start training 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:14.459
 here give a warmed song then song 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:16.859
 I only recommend it to anyone who has a good diet 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:19.430
 because he has a good rest and for whom 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:22.079
 has been training for some time before 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:23.110
 close this video I wanted to thank you 

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:25.150
 two people 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:27.250
 first I think barbosa has not 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:29.500
 No one, the guy is helping. 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:31.599
 advertising the channel dear very good people

 world I 'm even accused with it because 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:38.680
 He's filling his bag there to post. 

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:40.180
 my things and is the first time that the 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:42.159
 little he posted was already a couple of 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:44.560
 in the morning I told our face in that 

00:04:42.159 --> 00:04:47.080
 Schedule already helped me imagine the 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:48.580
 Then golden spoke there can not stay 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:50.319
 Calm down, I'll post your own another time. 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:53.409
 books live better'll help you 

00:04:50.319 --> 00:04:56.139
 to publicize then it was worth the aston hugs
