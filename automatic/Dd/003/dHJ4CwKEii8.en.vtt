00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:18.040
 there are liposculpture techniques and there 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:21.290
 technologies in sculpture 

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:23.510
 then the technologies in sculpture 

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:26.510
 basically they are divided into the ultrasound 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:30.460
 laser and vibrio liposculpture or 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:33.579
 motorized cannulas and 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:36.180
 the liposculpture techniques then it 

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:40.629
 refer to the way the surgeon 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:43.660
 extract the fat I think the best 

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:45.250
 technique is the technique that removes the 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:47.199
 amount of fat from the sites 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:50.220
 problems with any of the 

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:52.930
 technologies of which the surgeon 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:56.199
 dispose and do it in a way 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:58.780
 natural and pleasant in general when 

00:00:56.199 --> 00:01:02.409
 a liposculpture is technically good 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:05.800
 made and the patient gains weight the 

00:01:02.409 --> 00:01:08.740
 patient is not going to go up with his employer 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:12.429
 of fat distribution prior to 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:14.259
 surgery the patient goes up evenly I say 

00:01:12.429 --> 00:01:17.080
 me with the new pattern that the surgeon 

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:20.110
 gave him then here is very important 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:22.630
 the hand of the surgeon to have 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:25.479
 extracted in an appropriate manner that 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:27.550
 fat of the sites problems if that is 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:29.170
 got well done with surgery with 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:31.899
 any of the technologies either 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:34.119
 Laser will be or liposculpture vibrio 

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:36.310
 and the patient gets fat after 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:37.450
 patient is not going to come up with his 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.420
 let's call him with his 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:43.240
 problem before but it's going to go up from 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:46.920
 weight with that new shape that the surgeon 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:49.240
 gave him now why this is very important 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:52.630
 explain to our patients and 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:54.310
 educate him that liposculpture is not 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:57.549
 a surgery like a sport then I 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:59.439
 I get fat I do a lipo went down to the 

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:01.360
 six months come back and another lipo does not 

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:03.460
 because one should never do more than two 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.740
 surgeries of the body contour in the 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:07.569
 life of a patient why because the 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:09.640
 skin after will not respond then 

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:12.549
 Liposculpture has to come from the 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:14.440
 hand life changing for change 

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:17.110
 forgiveness in the patient's lifestyle 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.880
 in which the patient tries to put 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:21.069
 very much on his part of not returning to 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:23.880
 raise and lose weight to not alter the 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:23.880
 skin quality
