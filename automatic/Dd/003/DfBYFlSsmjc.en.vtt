that's<00:00:26.730> really<00:00:27.090> cool<00:00:27.300> about<00:00:27.539> these<00:00:27.720> speakers

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
that's really cool about these speakers

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.710 
that's really cool about these speakers
is<00:00:28.439> there's<00:00:29.340> some<00:00:29.580> great<00:00:29.910> controls<00:00:30.330> on<00:00:30.570> the

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
environment on the back you'll see this

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.060 
environment on the back you'll see this
acoustic<00:00:38.160> tuning<00:00:38.879> area<00:00:39.870> and<00:00:40.110> you<00:00:40.860> have

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
acoustic tuning area and you have

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.270 
acoustic tuning area and you have
controls<00:00:41.730> for<00:00:41.879> mid-range<00:00:42.120> and<00:00:42.570> high-end

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:43.280 
controls for mid-range and high-end

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.560 
controls for mid-range and high-end
tuning<00:00:44.280> but<00:00:44.820> the<00:00:45.059> other<00:00:45.180> thing<00:00:45.390> that's<00:00:45.450> really

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
tuning but the other thing that's really

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.510 
tuning but the other thing that's really
great<00:00:45.989> is<00:00:46.050> is<00:00:46.379> you've<00:00:46.559> got<00:00:46.770> this<00:00:46.920> acoustic

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
great is is you've got this acoustic

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.459 
great is is you've got this acoustic
space<00:00:47.789> switch<00:00:48.180> and<00:00:48.570> if<00:00:49.020> you<00:00:49.079> look<00:00:49.289> at<00:00:49.379> the

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
space switch and if you look at the

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.830 
space switch and if you look at the
diagrams<00:00:49.950> below<00:00:50.399> depending<00:00:50.940> on<00:00:51.360> where<00:00:51.629> you

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
diagrams below depending on where you

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.220 
diagrams below depending on where you
place<00:00:52.079> your<00:00:52.230> studio<00:00:52.890> monitors<00:00:53.899> as<00:00:54.899> you<00:00:55.079> can

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
place your studio monitors as you can

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.310 
place your studio monitors as you can
see<00:00:55.379> like<00:00:55.530> on<00:00:56.120> Figure<00:00:57.120> a<00:00:57.329> if<00:00:57.629> you<00:00:58.050> have<00:00:58.199> them

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
see like on Figure a if you have them

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.319 
see like on Figure a if you have them
kind<00:00:58.739> of<00:00:58.829> angled<00:00:59.309> in<00:00:59.430> it<00:00:59.579> you<00:00:59.760> kind<00:01:00.000> of<00:01:00.059> tight

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
kind of angled in it you kind of tight

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.920 
kind of angled in it you kind of tight
against<00:01:00.780> the<00:01:00.840> wall<00:01:00.930> or<00:01:01.460> be<00:01:02.460> if<00:01:02.730> they're<00:01:03.600> coming

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
against the wall or be if they're coming

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.899 
against the wall or be if they're coming
straight<00:01:04.049> at<00:01:04.260> you<00:01:04.619> but<00:01:04.949> they're<00:01:05.339> still<00:01:05.610> kind

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
straight at you but they're still kind

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.450 
straight at you but they're still kind
of<00:01:05.970> close<00:01:06.210> to<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:06.510> wall<00:01:06.689> and<00:01:06.960> then<00:01:07.560> see<00:01:07.890> if<00:01:08.189> you

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
of close to the wall and then see if you

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.250 
of close to the wall and then see if you
have<00:01:08.610> them<00:01:08.729> kind<00:01:08.970> of<00:01:09.119> straight<00:01:09.450> but<00:01:10.049> you've

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
have them kind of straight but you've

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.410 
have them kind of straight but you've
got<00:01:10.470> some<00:01:10.680> distance<00:01:11.100> between<00:01:11.280> you<00:01:12.060> and<00:01:12.090> the

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
got some distance between you and the

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.050 
got some distance between you and the
back<00:01:12.659> wall<00:01:12.900> you<00:01:13.200> can<00:01:13.740> change<00:01:14.159> the<00:01:14.610> acoustic

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
back wall you can change the acoustic

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.899 
back wall you can change the acoustic
space<00:01:15.299> just<00:01:15.659> by<00:01:15.810> flicking<00:01:16.439> the<00:01:16.710> switch<00:01:16.909> the

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
space just by flicking the switch the

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.280 
space just by flicking the switch the
other<00:01:18.030> thing<00:01:18.240> that<00:01:18.270> you<00:01:18.450> have<00:01:18.479> on<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:18.960> back<00:01:19.110> of

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
other thing that you have on the back of

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.560 
other thing that you have on the back of
the<00:01:19.380> air<00:01:19.530> monitors<00:01:20.310> is<00:01:20.520> a<00:01:20.580> variety<00:01:21.180> of

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
the air monitors is a variety of

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.249 
the air monitors is a variety of
different<00:01:22.320> inputs<00:01:22.830> so<00:01:23.070> whether<00:01:23.520> you're<00:01:23.790> using

00:01:24.249 --> 00:01:24.259 
different inputs so whether you're using

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:27.920 
different inputs so whether you're using
unbalanced<00:01:25.259> RCA<00:01:25.350> or<00:01:26.119> balanced<00:01:27.119> TRS<00:01:27.689> or

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
unbalanced RCA or balanced TRS or

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.840 
unbalanced RCA or balanced TRS or
balanced<00:01:28.500> XLR<00:01:28.770> you've<00:01:29.220> got<00:01:29.400> all<00:01:29.579> three

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
balanced XLR you've got all three

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.100 
balanced XLR you've got all three
connectors<00:01:30.329> on<00:01:30.509> the<00:01:30.540> back<00:01:32.450> so<00:01:33.450> now<00:01:33.780> let's

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
connectors on the back so now let's

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.330 
connectors on the back so now let's
listen<00:01:34.409> to<00:01:34.500> a<00:01:34.530> little<00:01:34.590> bit<00:01:34.920> of<00:01:35.009> audio

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
listen to a little bit of audio

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.429 
listen to a little bit of audio
demonstration<00:01:35.630> obviously<00:01:36.630> it's<00:01:37.229> the

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
demonstration obviously it's the

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.289 
demonstration obviously it's the
Internet<00:01:37.799> so<00:01:38.130> this<00:01:38.340> is<00:01:38.490> not<00:01:38.640> the<00:01:38.850> best<00:01:39.030> way<00:01:39.270> to

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
Internet so this is not the best way to

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.660 
Internet so this is not the best way to
demo<00:01:39.900> these<00:01:40.170> speakers<00:01:40.560> but<00:01:40.860> what<00:01:41.520> I'm<00:01:41.579> going

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
demo these speakers but what I'm going

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.999 
demo these speakers but what I'm going
to<00:01:41.729> be<00:01:41.850> playing<00:01:42.329> back<00:01:42.659> for<00:01:42.960> you<00:01:43.140> is<00:01:43.409> just<00:01:43.829> some

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
to be playing back for you is just some

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.690 
to be playing back for you is just some
raw<00:01:44.720> multitrack<00:01:45.720> files<00:01:45.990> this<00:01:46.229> is<00:01:46.290> not

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 
raw multitrack files this is not

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.280 
raw multitrack files this is not
mastered<00:01:47.700> audio<00:01:48.420> at<00:01:48.600> all<00:01:48.720> this<00:01:48.930> was<00:01:49.110> actually

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
mastered audio at all this was actually

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.679 
mastered audio at all this was actually
recorded<00:01:49.770> one<00:01:50.100> of<00:01:50.130> our<00:01:50.310> artists<00:01:50.759> Brianna
