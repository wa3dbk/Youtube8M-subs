00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:04.859
 Araquari was already remembered as the 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.740
 capital of the state of maracuja 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:09.809
 annually sets a record in harvests and 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.730
 producers increasingly bet 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.099
 this culture is isabela over time 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.179
 diseases have eventually 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.400
 productivity 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.740
 now searches for new varieties 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.470
 which is better suited to the region's climate 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.670
 and are also more resistant to 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:30.060
 fungi and viruses 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:33.059
 accompany in the article the culture of the 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.430
 passion fruit has always been essential for 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:38.100
 municipality of araquari near 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.530
 Joinville in northern Santa Catarina 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.140
 many rural families had this 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.800
 activity as the main 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:49.140
 but in recent years local production 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:52.190
 has greatly reduced the 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:56.070
 difficult to harvest 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:01:00.090
 araquari came to have harvests of almost 4 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:03.390
 thousand tons a year today 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:06.450
 more than 600 tonnes per year an impact 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:08.909
 and so much for who depends on this fruit 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.430
 for this reason, the producers of 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.799
 region are working together in a 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.590
 participatory research 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:19.799
 work is being carried out by the 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:23.070
 epagri here of araquari is precisely the 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:24.810
 selection of plants more resistant to 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.689
 passion fruit diseases 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.610
 the search for specific seeds for 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:32.369
 this type of climate 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:35.850
 all this to strengthen araquari with 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:38.670
 a passion fruit capital of Santa Catarina 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:41.280
 rodrigo simões engineer agronomist 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.770
 epagri speaks of the fall of production in 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.470
 region and the main reasons for 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:49.860
 led to this retraction 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:52.170
 analyzing the profile of the production of 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:56.579
 passion fruit over the years 20 years of 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:59.490
 produced a peak in production in the 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:02.189
 first ten years he did not start falling 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.320
 this according to the incidence of illness 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:05.420
 that just brought that program diseases 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.920
 by municipality 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:09.700
 basically the lack of care in the 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.670
 production itself 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:15.190
 the calendar year an easy situation is just 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.840
 plant and harvest and went relaxing 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:20.739
 then there was an incidence of the disease 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:24.849
 due to a bad care when driving in 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:27.340
 and to obtain improvements in the 

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:29.470
 passion fruit fighting fungi and viruses 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.239
 typical of culture 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.640
 nothing better than the performance of 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:36.190
 professionals from the area 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:40.420
 field experience of producers 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:43.269
 hence the participatory research is thus 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:47.349
 that the work is already giving results 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:50.560
 his iracilde has worked for 14 years in 

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:53.739
 passion fruit farming has about 1,200 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:55.900
 Lord's feet, so the sound was 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:57.819
 explaining that you have made some 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:00.700
 tests on this first other seeds 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:03.310
 that they will explain if it is in the case 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:05.380
 of these passion fruit you made here 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:08.140
 to have this passion fruit is more 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:10.060
 resistant and with more quality 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:13.390
 is one of the great challenges that people 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:15.280
 I had was to make the existing passion in 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:17.380
 region because why us when we 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:20.049
 we started planting passion fruit here in the 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:22.030
 region 14 years ago we started to 

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:24.700
 to work with seed, right? 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:27.880
 It's been working a few years with seed. 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:28.750
 the producer made our seedlings 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.870
 knowledge 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:33.100
 then still looked for began to seek 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:36.190
 felt that it would have to increase production 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:38.260
 and seek to be related 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:41.829
 and then we started looking for 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:43.180
 seedlings is similar in general mining right 

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:45.340
 here comes the technician in mines general gave 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:47.799
 some hope we started to 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:50.380
 to plant the seed of mines 

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:52.150
 but there the problem the mine seed 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:55.599
 because a totally 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:57.730
 different from there to ours here, right? 

00:03:55.599 --> 00:04:00.609
 and over the years I started to have 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:01.920
 problems with our production 

00:04:00.609 --> 00:04:06.819
 of passion fruit 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:08.590
 then we started looking for urussanga in the 

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:10.959
 Urussanga Experimental Station in the 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:13.870
 recent years was already planting the 

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:15.849
 seed of gold blood but it is in our 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:18.909
 meeting guilty only of the page 

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:21.070
 the union it uses the producers I 

00:04:18.909 --> 00:04:23.500
 I started as soon as the following knots 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:26.620
 continue not having a seed 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:27.460
 is acclimatised our region with the 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:28.840
 our climate 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:31.390
 We will continue to say have 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:35.410
 Hence, I would suggest that people 

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:37.150
 make some seeds we're not acclimatized 

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:39.190
 Ours with our climate 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:41.830
 and then I started to propose to do that 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:42.880
 because we had a quality until 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:45.460
 reasonable 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:47.560
 I set out to make your menus and then 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:49.690
 We did it We did not get the 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:53.290
 first year passion fruit that quim 

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:54.970
 We caught after a foot passion 

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:57.370
 passion fruit that is born there in the 

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:58.180
 was a passion fruit of the planting of five years 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:01.870
 behind 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:03.250
 and then we made the right merger and the 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:05.460
 seed of passion fruit that we have 

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:09.070
 also brought humans up a year ago 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:11.560
 of morretes in the paraná that was a shadow 

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:12.910
 accused of the region 

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:15.910
 then we merged these 

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:18.010
 growth and this result one of the 

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:22.120
 carry on the attack marks 

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:25.270
 here but to arrive at these results 

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:29.800
 much information and 

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:32.890
 Of course having attitude and with your will say 

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:34.810
 so the difficulties appear and he 

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:37.810
 runs after injury 

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:39.550
 you have to make a living for it. 

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:41.440
 and family 

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:43.810
 so he bought a machine 

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:45.970
 stripper fair 

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:47.380
 here we are willing to talk about leaving 

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:50.830
 bit ready right 

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:53.169
 the seed we use for the silver of 

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:54.640
 creation of equipment for chicken I is 

00:05:53.169 --> 00:05:57.910
 a very good deal 

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:59.890
 Today you enjoy bark if you are 

00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:03.370
 very timely make flour 

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:06.250
 of passion fruit peel proven 

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:09.010
 that the tool for diabetes is then 

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:12.729
 in the human truth whose today you do 

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:15.400
 all in use when 

00:06:12.729 --> 00:06:18.010
 in diseases in the adult plant is 

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:21.520
 I need to turn the attention back there 

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:24.130
 still in the seed it is no use taking all 

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:26.860
 care in the field if the seedling 

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:29.410
 strong and healthy 

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:32.200
 when we are going to sow this seedling 

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:35.830
 seed is the main source of where 

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:36.680
 comes without having disease and problems later on 

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:40.699
 production 

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:44.419
 and with some problem in the farmer we 

00:06:40.699 --> 00:06:46.340
 producer who takes very good care of the 

00:06:44.419 --> 00:06:49.610
 plants after adult 

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:51.620
 there in your crop or it is no use 

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:53.960
 nothing after doing a job there if 

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:56.570
 It does not want to be healthy anymore and only I 

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:58.610
 but even so they still healthy here 

00:06:56.570 --> 00:07:01.130
 the farmer in the field will have to have 

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:05.030
 taking care of producing 

00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:08.389
 quality here in the Araquari 

00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:11.990
 problems appeared and discouraged 

00:07:08.389 --> 00:07:14.570
 people more joint action brings 

00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:16.430
 new hope to producers 

00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:19.130
 and nothing better for example from your 

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:21.800
 iracilde is infecting whoever 

00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:25.340
 Doubt it was quarry, yes you can go back 

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:28.580
 to your good times of good harvest 

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:30.590
 of passion fruit and today what we 

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:33.080
 said that our challenge is to continue to 

00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:34.940
 use because why passion fruit today 

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:36.889
 he returns 

00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:38.570
 the bigger problem is to make us produce 

00:07:36.889 --> 00:07:41.030
 more time trying to work this 

00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:42.919
 question I think from now on 

00:07:41.030 --> 00:07:45.409
 I think we have to join forces. 

00:07:42.919 --> 00:07:50.349
 products in the region to work 

00:07:45.409 --> 00:07:54.229
 this issue is not giving up on the first 

00:07:50.349 --> 00:07:56.780
 round but we'll be fighting for what 

00:07:54.229 --> 00:07:59.260
 this happens that our producer is 

00:07:56.780 --> 00:08:02.360
 acquire this capacity we are 

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:05.240
 seeing form we chasing after the trios 

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:07.780
 ways to continue producing passion fruit 

00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:07.780
 in the region
