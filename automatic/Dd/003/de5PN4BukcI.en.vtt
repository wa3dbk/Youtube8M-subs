they kind of go under the radar a little

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:35.690 
they kind of go under the radar a little
bit<00:01:34.710> especially<00:01:35.040> after<00:01:35.340> we<00:01:35.490> watch<00:01:35.670> that

horrific performance against the 49ers a

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.160

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
really really good offensive line beat

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.490 
really really good offensive line beat
that<00:01:51.119> can<00:01:51.329> establish<00:01:51.630> the<00:01:52.020> run<00:01:52.140> game<00:01:52.380> it's

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
that can establish the run game it's

that can establish the run game it's
going<00:01:52.649> to<00:01:52.740> be<00:01:52.799> fun<00:01:53.040> to<00:01:53.549> see<00:01:53.579> this<00:01:53.880> offensive

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
going to be fun to see this offensive

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.060 
going to be fun to see this offensive

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
line against Graham defensive line and

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.190 
line against Graham defensive line and
so<00:01:56.490> far<00:01:56.759> the<00:01:56.880> for<00:01:57.060> the<00:01:57.270> Dallas<00:01:57.570> defense<00:01:57.719> has

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
so far the for the Dallas defense has

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.440 
so far the for the Dallas defense has
been<00:01:58.340> coming<00:01:59.340> out<00:01:59.430> and<00:01:59.549> ready<00:01:59.729> to<00:01:59.850> play<00:02:00.000> this

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
been coming out and ready to play this

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.030 
been coming out and ready to play this
is<00:02:00.630> a<00:02:00.659> different<00:02:01.079> defense<00:02:01.439> than<00:02:01.590> what<00:02:01.740> we<00:02:01.860> saw

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
is a different defense than what we saw

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.190 
is a different defense than what we saw
last<00:02:02.070> year<00:02:02.579> you<00:02:03.030> remember<00:02:03.420> Tennessee<00:02:03.930> d

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
last year you remember Tennessee d

Kansas City handily in Kansas City Week
one<00:02:06.570> I<00:02:06.630> thought<00:02:06.899> valid<00:02:07.200> the<00:02:07.290> statement<00:02:07.770> went

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
one I thought valid the statement went

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.619 
one I thought valid the statement went
for<00:02:08.099> Dallas<00:02:08.459> I<00:02:08.640> think<00:02:09.149> the<00:02:09.239> Rams<00:02:09.450> are

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
for Dallas I think the Rams are

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.059 
for Dallas I think the Rams are
obviously<00:02:10.170> a<00:02:10.229> mess<00:02:10.500> at<00:02:10.649> the<00:02:10.679> quarterback

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
obviously a mess at the quarterback

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.100 
obviously a mess at the quarterback
situation<00:02:11.489> they<00:02:12.060> kind<00:02:12.270> of<00:02:12.330> wanted<00:02:12.569> defensive

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
situation they kind of wanted defensive

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.970 
situation they kind of wanted defensive
field-goal<00:02:13.410> battle

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
field-goal battle

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.920 
field-goal battle
Tampa<00:02:14.400> Bay<00:02:14.550> I<00:02:14.760> think<00:02:15.239> Dallas<00:02:15.360> has<00:02:15.629> too<00:02:15.810> many

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
Tampa Bay I think Dallas has too many

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.899 
Tampa Bay I think Dallas has too many
weapons<00:02:16.200> on<00:02:16.590> on<00:02:16.860> offense<00:02:17.489> I<00:02:17.640> think<00:02:17.819> they're

00:02:17.899 --> 00:02:17.909 
weapons on on offense I think they're

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:19.160 
weapons on on offense I think they're
going<00:02:18.000> to<00:02:18.060> get<00:02:18.150> enough<00:02:18.390> points<00:02:18.599> i<00:02:18.870> think<00:02:19.049> they

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
going to get enough points i think they

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:20.690 
going to get enough points i think they
win<00:02:19.319> this<00:02:19.470> football<00:02:19.709> game<00:02:19.920> i'd<00:02:20.220> be<00:02:20.340> shocked<00:02:20.580> to

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
win this football game i'd be shocked to

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.250 
win this football game i'd be shocked to
see<00:02:20.879> and<00:02:21.000> fall<00:02:21.150> flat<00:02:21.390> on<00:02:21.450> their<00:02:21.569> face<00:02:21.840> the

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
see and fall flat on their face the

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.199 
see and fall flat on their face the
question<00:02:22.650> is<00:02:22.799> then<00:02:23.040> you<00:02:23.610> know<00:02:23.640> why<00:02:23.940> is<00:02:24.000> this

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
question is then you know why is this

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:25.910 
question is then you know why is this
line<00:02:24.480> where<00:02:24.870> it<00:02:24.989> is<00:02:25.110> why<00:02:25.290> is<00:02:25.349> it<00:02:25.530> so<00:02:25.709> low<00:02:25.890> i

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
line where it is why is it so low i

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.770 
line where it is why is it so low i
guess<00:02:26.220> you'd<00:02:26.459> say<00:02:26.670> because<00:02:27.000> st.<00:02:27.269> Louis<00:02:27.299> got<00:02:27.750> a

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
guess you'd say because st. Louis got a

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.630 
guess you'd say because st. Louis got a
road<00:02:27.989> win<00:02:28.200> last<00:02:28.379> week<00:02:28.620> maybe<00:02:28.799> I<00:02:29.069> think<00:02:29.519> it

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
road win last week maybe I think it

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:30.979 
road win last week maybe I think it
stopped<00:02:29.849> you<00:02:30.030> know<00:02:30.060> st.<00:02:30.390> Louis<00:02:30.599> has<00:02:30.720> always

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:30.989 
stopped you know st. Louis has always

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:32.900 
stopped you know st. Louis has always
known<00:02:31.260> in<00:02:31.440> the<00:02:31.530> tub<00:02:31.739> replace<00:02:32.069> the<00:02:32.280> play<00:02:32.459> like<00:02:32.760> I

said be most people out there to look at

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:36.530 
said be most people out there to look at
Dallas<00:02:35.310> they<00:02:35.430> just<00:02:35.640> think<00:02:35.879> stayed<00:02:36.120> Dallas

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
Dallas they just think stayed Dallas

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.059 
Dallas they just think stayed Dallas
fade<00:02:36.750> Dallas<00:02:37.170> Dallas<00:02:37.319> and<00:02:37.799> a<00:02:37.860> team<00:02:38.040> that

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:38.069 
fade Dallas Dallas and a team that

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:39.979 
fade Dallas Dallas and a team that
hasn't<00:02:38.610> covered<00:02:38.910> too<00:02:39.180> many<00:02:39.330> spreads<00:02:39.690> here<00:02:39.900> in

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
hasn't covered too many spreads here in

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:41.839 
hasn't covered too many spreads here in
the<00:02:40.079> past<00:02:40.290> so<00:02:40.560> I<00:02:40.769> think<00:02:41.280> people<00:02:41.459> are<00:02:41.670> probably

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:41.849 
the past so I think people are probably

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:43.610 
the past so I think people are probably
exiting<00:02:42.450> out<00:02:42.540> of<00:02:42.720> their<00:02:42.810> mind<00:02:43.019> what<00:02:43.260> happened

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
exiting out of their mind what happened

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.559 
exiting out of their mind what happened
last<00:02:43.769> week<00:02:44.040> and<00:02:44.250> then<00:02:44.700> just<00:02:44.909> thinkin<00:02:45.269> Dallas

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:45.569 
last week and then just thinkin Dallas

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:47.150 
last week and then just thinkin Dallas
of<00:02:45.690> an<00:02:45.810> eight<00:02:45.959> make<00:02:46.200> rapke<00:02:46.680> team<00:02:46.860> again<00:02:47.129> I

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
of an eight make rapke team again I

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:48.410 
of an eight make rapke team again I
