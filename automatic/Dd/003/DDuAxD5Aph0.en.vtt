00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:20.340 
here and there and I'm able to get

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:21.950 
here and there and I'm able to get
myself<00:05:20.490> some<00:05:20.820> assists<00:05:21.180> and<00:05:21.270> play<00:05:21.389> some<00:05:21.570> decent

myself some assists and play some decent

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:23.749 
myself some assists and play some decent
defense<00:05:22.080> so<00:05:22.500> I<00:05:22.680> don't<00:05:23.039> really<00:05:23.130> know<00:05:23.340> how<00:05:23.550> much

00:05:23.749 --> 00:05:23.759 
defense so I don't really know how much

00:05:23.759 --> 00:05:25.339 
defense so I don't really know how much
long<00:05:23.940> I'm<00:05:24.090> gonna<00:05:24.210> keep<00:05:24.389> my<00:05:24.570> God<00:05:24.750> the<00:05:24.930> way<00:05:25.080> he<00:05:25.110> is

00:05:25.339 --> 00:05:25.349 
long I'm gonna keep my God the way he is

00:05:25.349 --> 00:05:26.960 
long I'm gonna keep my God the way he is
but<00:05:25.740> it<00:05:25.860> seems<00:05:26.070> like<00:05:26.250> even<00:05:26.430> if<00:05:26.580> you<00:05:26.669> do<00:05:26.789> have<00:05:26.909> a

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:26.970 
but it seems like even if you do have a

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:28.790 
but it seems like even if you do have a
low<00:05:27.150> overall<00:05:27.509> as<00:05:27.750> long<00:05:28.169> as<00:05:28.289> you<00:05:28.380> play<00:05:28.530> some

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:28.800 
low overall as long as you play some

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:30.200 
low overall as long as you play some
really<00:05:29.070> good<00:05:29.280> fundamental<00:05:29.789> basketball<00:05:29.909> you

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:30.210 
really good fundamental basketball you

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:32.930 
really good fundamental basketball you
should<00:05:30.360> be<00:05:30.509> fine<00:05:30.720> but<00:05:30.930> Chris<00:05:31.199> Paul<00:05:31.800> hold<00:05:32.340> on

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:32.940 
should be fine but Chris Paul hold on

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:35.810 
should be fine but Chris Paul hold on
how<00:05:33.539> did<00:05:33.599> he<00:05:33.930> hit<00:05:34.139> that<00:05:34.349> shot<00:05:34.740> over<00:05:35.610> not<00:05:35.789> only

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:35.820 
how did he hit that shot over not only

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:37.939 
how did he hit that shot over not only
me<00:05:36.479> but<00:05:36.509> I<00:05:36.780> believe<00:05:37.110> that<00:05:37.289> was<00:05:37.380> Devin<00:05:37.710> Harris

00:05:37.939 --> 00:05:37.949 
me but I believe that was Devin Harris

00:05:37.949 --> 00:05:40.129 
me but I believe that was Devin Harris
or<00:05:38.190> Monta<00:05:38.520> Ellis<00:05:38.550> as<00:05:38.909> well<00:05:39.150> so<00:05:39.330> he<00:05:39.479> just<00:05:39.659> shot<00:05:39.900> a

00:05:40.129 --> 00:05:40.139 
or Monta Ellis as well so he just shot a

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:43.610 
or Monta Ellis as well so he just shot a
you<00:05:41.070> know<00:05:41.220> a<00:05:41.430> buzzard<00:05:41.880> beam<00:05:42.060> three-pointer<00:05:42.840> so

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:43.620 
you know a buzzard beam three-pointer so

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:46.129 
you know a buzzard beam three-pointer so
far<00:05:43.949> out<00:05:44.220> from<00:05:44.580> the<00:05:44.699> perimeter<00:05:45.030> over<00:05:45.479> two

00:05:46.129 --> 00:05:46.139 
far out from the perimeter over two

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:47.870 
far out from the perimeter over two
defenders<00:05:46.289> and<00:05:46.680> got<00:05:47.130> it<00:05:47.310> to<00:05:47.460> go<00:05:47.580> you<00:05:47.610> know
