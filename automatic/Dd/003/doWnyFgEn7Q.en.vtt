thought<00:01:20.430> conditions<00:01:20.939> were<00:01:21.060> playing<00:01:21.270> really

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
thought conditions were playing really

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.899 
thought conditions were playing really
fast<00:01:21.750> today<00:01:21.960> and<00:01:22.439> then<00:01:22.770> I<00:01:23.100> didn't<00:01:23.610> make<00:01:23.729> many

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
fast today and then I didn't make many

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.760 
fast today and then I didn't make many
mistakes<00:01:24.090> from<00:01:24.930> the<00:01:25.080> baseline<00:01:25.259> I<00:01:25.500> think<00:01:25.680> it

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
mistakes from the baseline I think it

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.249 
mistakes from the baseline I think it
was<00:01:25.860> very<00:01:26.070> concentrated<00:01:26.820> on<00:01:27.240> how<00:01:27.780> my<00:01:28.080> game

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
was very concentrated on how my game

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.260 
was very concentrated on how my game
plan<00:01:28.470> should<00:01:28.770> be<00:01:28.829> and<00:01:29.189> then<00:01:29.549> I<00:01:29.700> was<00:01:29.880> able<00:01:29.909> to

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
plan should be and then I was able to

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.999 
plan should be and then I was able to
you<00:01:30.600> know<00:01:30.689> pull<00:01:30.930> away<00:01:31.020> quickly<00:01:31.409> it<00:01:31.619> was<00:01:31.710> a<00:01:31.740> set

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
you know pull away quickly it was a set

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.039 
you know pull away quickly it was a set
and<00:01:32.189> a<00:01:32.220> break<00:01:32.250> and<00:01:32.759> from<00:01:33.210> then<00:01:33.360> on<00:01:33.420> obviously

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
and a break and from then on obviously

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.980 
and a break and from then on obviously
got<00:01:34.229> got<00:01:34.590> tougher<00:01:34.920> for<00:01:35.070> him<00:01:35.130> but<00:01:35.430> he<00:01:35.850> got<00:01:36.780> into

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
got got tougher for him but he got into

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.660 
got got tougher for him but he got into
the<00:01:37.079> match<00:01:37.200> in<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:37.439> third<00:01:37.650> and<00:01:37.829> he<00:01:37.920> became<00:01:38.340> a

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
the match in the third and he became a

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.340 
the match in the third and he became a
pretty<00:01:39.030> tough<00:01:39.240> match<00:01:39.479> I<00:01:39.630> thought<00:01:39.840> after<00:01:40.049> that

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
pretty tough match I thought after that

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.770 
pretty tough match I thought after that
but<00:01:40.680> I<00:01:41.040> just<00:01:41.490> think<00:01:41.909> I<00:01:42.060> mix<00:01:42.420> it<00:01:42.479> up<00:01:42.570> well

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
but I just think I mix it up well

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.179 
but I just think I mix it up well
against<00:01:43.170> him<00:01:43.290> and<00:01:43.380> maybe<00:01:43.500> just<00:01:43.829> a<00:01:43.920> bit<00:01:44.009> too

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
against him and maybe just a bit too

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:45.740 
against him and maybe just a bit too
much<00:01:44.399> to<00:01:44.610> really<00:01:44.850> allow<00:01:45.390> them<00:01:45.479> to<00:01:45.600> feel

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
much to really allow them to feel

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.630 
much to really allow them to feel
comfortable<00:01:45.780> even<00:01:46.710> on<00:01:46.799> clean<00:01:47.009> so<00:01:47.430> will<00:01:47.549> you

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
comfortable even on clean so will you

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.490 
comfortable even on clean so will you
take<00:01:47.850> out<00:01:48.000> of<00:01:48.119> a<00:01:48.180> match<00:01:48.360> like<00:01:48.390> that<00:01:48.630> the<00:01:49.259> fact

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
take out of a match like that the fact

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:50.899 
take out of a match like that the fact
that<00:01:49.590> you<00:01:49.829> played<00:01:50.100> the<00:01:50.250> right<00:01:50.399> shot<00:01:50.640> at<00:01:50.670> the

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
that you played the right shot at the

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.490 
that you played the right shot at the
right<00:01:51.090> time<00:01:51.360> or<00:01:51.780> that<00:01:52.110> you're<00:01:52.259> hitting<00:01:52.470> the

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
right time or that you're hitting the

right time or that you're hitting the
ball<00:01:52.590> really<00:01:52.920> well<00:01:53.220> I<00:01:53.250> mean<00:01:53.490> tactically<00:01:54.090> was

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.749 
of both honest I think I'm hitting a
ball<00:01:58.049> at<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.259> moment<00:01:58.590> you<00:01:59.100> know<00:01:59.219> I'm<00:01:59.310> setting

that you're coming in on shots like that

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.720 
that you're coming in on shots like that
and<00:02:36.299> and<00:02:36.780> you're<00:02:37.349> prepared<00:02:37.680> to<00:02:38.129> hit<00:02:38.340> a<00:02:38.370> tough

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:40.079 
of ollie you're not waiting for an easy

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:42.140 
of ollie you're not waiting for an easy
volley<00:02:40.349> and<00:02:40.590> again<00:02:41.220> there's<00:02:41.640> a<00:02:41.730> lot<00:02:41.909> of<00:02:41.940> talk

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
volley and again there's a lot of talk

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:43.670 
volley and again there's a lot of talk
about<00:02:42.180> you<00:02:42.480> changing<00:02:42.690> your<00:02:42.959> style<00:02:43.349> or<00:02:43.500> every

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
about you changing your style or every

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.110 
about you changing your style or every
but<00:02:43.769> it<00:02:43.860> really<00:02:44.190> seems<00:02:44.310> to<00:02:44.670> me<00:02:44.790> like<00:02:44.819> it's

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
but it really seems to me like it's

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.089 
but it really seems to me like it's
happening<00:02:45.329> yeah<00:02:45.989> I'm<00:02:46.170> working<00:02:46.590> I<00:02:46.709> think<00:02:47.010> this

00:02:47.089 --> 00:02:47.099 
happening yeah I'm working I think this

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:48.800 
happening yeah I'm working I think this
is<00:02:47.160> how<00:02:47.370> I<00:02:47.400> you<00:02:47.579> always<00:02:47.940> used<00:02:48.120> to<00:02:48.209> play<00:02:48.450> I<00:02:48.629> just

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
is how I you always used to play I just

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.270 
is how I you always used to play I just
think<00:02:48.959> it<00:02:49.140> becomes<00:02:49.410> something<00:02:49.650> harder<00:02:50.160> to

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
think it becomes something harder to

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:51.920 
think it becomes something harder to
come<00:02:50.489> to<00:02:50.519> the<00:02:50.730> net<00:02:50.879> just<00:02:51.060> because<00:02:51.299> about<00:02:51.480> guys

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
come to the net just because about guys

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.809 
come to the net just because about guys
are<00:02:52.140> hitting<00:02:52.260> harder<00:02:52.950> and<00:02:53.129> by<00:02:53.220> hitting<00:02:53.400> harder

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:53.819 
are hitting harder and by hitting harder

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:55.940 
are hitting harder and by hitting harder
that<00:02:53.970> hits<00:02:54.120> deeper<00:02:54.540> too<00:02:54.750> so<00:02:55.109> you<00:02:55.530> know<00:02:55.650> either

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
that hits deeper too so you know either

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.160 
that hits deeper too so you know either
they're<00:02:56.910> just<00:02:57.060> going<00:02:57.150> to<00:02:57.239> hit<00:02:57.420> it<00:02:57.450> past<00:02:57.780> you<00:02:58.019> or

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
they're just going to hit it past you or

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:59.780 
they're just going to hit it past you or
they're<00:02:58.319> going<00:02:58.409> to<00:02:58.470> make<00:02:58.620> a<00:02:58.650> mistake<00:02:59.010> or<00:02:59.280> it's

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
they're going to make a mistake or it's

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:01.309 
they're going to make a mistake or it's
not<00:02:59.970> so<00:03:00.120> much<00:03:00.180> you<00:03:00.480> know<00:03:00.510> that's<00:03:00.750> cheap<00:03:01.140> and

00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:01.319 
not so much you know that's cheap and

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:02.960 
not so much you know that's cheap and
then<00:03:01.470> you<00:03:01.590> get<00:03:01.920> the<00:03:02.040> chance<00:03:02.220> to<00:03:02.370> come<00:03:02.459> in<00:03:02.760> like

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
then you get the chance to come in like

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:04.819 
then you get the chance to come in like
we<00:03:03.150> saw<00:03:03.329> more<00:03:03.569> against<00:03:03.750> Lopez<00:03:03.989> you<00:03:04.349> know<00:03:04.500> sure

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:04.829 
we saw more against Lopez you know sure

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:07.280 
we saw more against Lopez you know sure
so<00:03:05.099> i<00:03:05.129> think<00:03:05.250> i<00:03:05.700> was<00:03:06.209> able<00:03:06.359> to<00:03:06.569> maneuver<00:03:06.780> stand

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
so i think i was able to maneuver stand

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:08.990 
so i think i was able to maneuver stand
around<00:03:07.470> well<00:03:07.769> and<00:03:08.310> like<00:03:08.430> you<00:03:08.549> said<00:03:08.700> thing<00:03:08.940> i

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
around well and like you said thing i

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.009 
around well and like you said thing i
really<00:03:09.150> do<00:03:09.329> have<00:03:09.480> to<00:03:09.540> take<00:03:09.780> my<00:03:09.900> opportunities

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:10.019 
really do have to take my opportunities

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:11.599 
really do have to take my opportunities
to<00:03:10.620> come<00:03:10.799> to<00:03:10.920> the<00:03:11.010> net<00:03:11.129> because<00:03:11.400> i<00:03:11.430> actually

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:11.609 
to come to the net because i actually

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:13.099

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
because i think i don't know if it was a

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:16.280 
because i think i don't know if it was a
year<00:03:14.909> ago<00:03:15.030> or<00:03:15.209> one<00:03:15.750> and<00:03:15.840> a<00:03:15.900> half<00:03:15.930> years<00:03:16.230> ago

do you back off at the beginning and
then<00:03:39.269> I<00:03:39.480> mean<00:03:39.720> how<00:03:39.930> does<00:03:40.049> it<00:03:40.169> I<00:03:40.200> just<00:03:40.799> look<00:03:41.160> at

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
then I mean how does it I just look at

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:42.890 
then I mean how does it I just look at
the<00:03:41.340> big<00:03:41.489> pictures<00:03:41.879> I<00:03:42.000> don't<00:03:42.180> enter<00:03:42.510> into<00:03:42.660> to

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
the big pictures I don't enter into to

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:44.360 
the big pictures I don't enter into to
too<00:03:43.139> many<00:03:43.260> tournaments<00:03:43.650> because<00:03:43.949> the<00:03:44.220> worst

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
too many tournaments because the worst

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:46.250 
too many tournaments because the worst
thing<00:03:44.519> I<00:03:44.730> think<00:03:44.790> is<00:03:45.060> for<00:03:45.389> myself<00:03:45.750> and<00:03:45.930> for<00:03:45.959> fans

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
thing I think is for myself and for fans

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:47.930 
thing I think is for myself and for fans
as<00:03:46.500> if<00:03:46.680> they<00:03:46.859> get<00:03:47.010> disappointed<00:03:47.609> by<00:03:47.699> me

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
as if they get disappointed by me

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.270 
as if they get disappointed by me
pulling<00:03:48.209> out<00:03:48.419> in<00:03:48.870> at<00:03:49.260> some<00:03:49.410> stage<00:03:49.709> I<00:03:49.889> can

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280 
pulling out in at some stage I can

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.250 
pulling out in at some stage I can
anyway<00:03:50.760> always<00:03:51.030> get<00:03:51.180> a<00:03:51.209> wild<00:03:51.510> card<00:03:51.629> anywhere<00:03:52.199> I

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
anyway always get a wild card anywhere I

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.099 
anyway always get a wild card anywhere I
want<00:03:52.560> to<00:03:52.620> so<00:03:52.949> I<00:03:53.160> always<00:03:53.699> I<00:03:54.030> think<00:03:54.359> I<00:03:54.480> also<00:03:54.810> tried

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:55.109 
want to so I always I think I also tried

00:03:55.109 --> 00:03:56.900 
want to so I always I think I also tried
to<00:03:55.139> set<00:03:55.410> the<00:03:55.530> trend<00:03:55.799> of<00:03:55.949> not<00:03:56.400> entering<00:03:56.549> too

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910 
to set the trend of not entering too

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:59.119 
to set the trend of not entering too
many<00:03:57.120> tournaments<00:03:57.480> you<00:03:57.900> know<00:03:58.019> so<00:03:58.980> I<00:03:59.010> think

00:03:59.119 --> 00:03:59.129 
many tournaments you know so I think

00:03:59.129 --> 00:04:00.770 
many tournaments you know so I think
that's<00:03:59.340> been<00:03:59.669> smart<00:04:00.060> and<00:04:00.269> then<00:04:00.359> you<00:04:00.569> know<00:04:00.660> when

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
that's been smart and then you know when

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:02.059 
that's been smart and then you know when
you're<00:04:00.870> lacking<00:04:01.049> matches<00:04:01.470> you<00:04:01.560> can<00:04:01.680> always

00:04:02.059 --> 00:04:02.069 
you're lacking matches you can always

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:03.409 
you're lacking matches you can always
still<00:04:02.310> you<00:04:02.519> know<00:04:02.609> except<00:04:03.000> a<00:04:03.060> wire<00:04:03.239> cut

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:03.419 
still you know except a wire cut

00:04:03.419 --> 00:04:04.849 
still you know except a wire cut
somewhere<00:04:03.720> which<00:04:03.900> I<00:04:04.019> haven't<00:04:04.319> had<00:04:04.379> to<00:04:04.530> do<00:04:04.650> in

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:04.859 
somewhere which I haven't had to do in

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:06.860 
somewhere which I haven't had to do in
you<00:04:05.069> know<00:04:05.190> over<00:04:05.730> a<00:04:05.790> long<00:04:06.060> period<00:04:06.090> of<00:04:06.449> time<00:04:06.510> and

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870 
you know over a long period of time and

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:08.360 
you know over a long period of time and
I<00:04:06.900> always<00:04:07.019> say<00:04:07.290> if<00:04:07.440> you<00:04:07.470> play<00:04:07.709> less<00:04:07.919> at<00:04:08.129> times

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
I always say if you play less at times

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:10.520 
I always say if you play less at times
that<00:04:09.030> adds<00:04:09.389> up<00:04:09.690> at<00:04:09.930> the<00:04:10.019> back<00:04:10.199> end<00:04:10.410> of<00:04:10.500> your

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 
that adds up at the back end of your

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:12.559 
that adds up at the back end of your
career<00:04:10.799> because<00:04:11.579> my<00:04:11.849> goal<00:04:12.150> has<00:04:12.299> always<00:04:12.419> been

00:04:12.559 --> 00:04:12.569 
career because my goal has always been

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:14.809 
career because my goal has always been
longevity<00:04:13.019> and<00:04:13.410> to<00:04:13.560> play<00:04:13.739> for<00:04:13.949> a<00:04:14.160> long<00:04:14.579> time

00:04:14.809 --> 00:04:14.819 
longevity and to play for a long time

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:16.699 
longevity and to play for a long time
and<00:04:15.090> I<00:04:15.419> think<00:04:15.690> by<00:04:16.019> looking<00:04:16.229> at<00:04:16.410> the<00:04:16.530> big

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:16.709 
and I think by looking at the big

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:19.039 
and I think by looking at the big
picture<00:04:16.739> not<00:04:17.280> being<00:04:17.489> hurried<00:04:17.820> into<00:04:18.060> you<00:04:18.930> know

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:19.049

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:21.949 
picture not being hurried into you know
panic<00:04:19.799> decisions<00:04:20.280> just<00:04:20.669> by<00:04:20.910> the<00:04:20.970> results<00:04:21.870> at

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:21.959 
panic decisions just by the results at

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:23.480 
panic decisions just by the results at
that<00:04:22.229> very<00:04:22.440> moment<00:04:22.560> I<00:04:23.010> think<00:04:23.219> I've<00:04:23.370> been

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490 
that very moment I think I've been

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:25.070 
that very moment I think I've been
always<00:04:23.640> also<00:04:24.240> been<00:04:24.599> able<00:04:24.750> to<00:04:24.930> stay

true to my plan and it's paid off with
the<00:04:28.670> biggest<00:04:28.910> tournaments<00:04:29.330> but<00:04:29.480> I<00:04:29.780> feel<00:04:30.170> like

any of those feelings um yeah I've never
thought<00:04:53.450> about<00:04:53.510> it<00:04:53.720> that<00:04:53.840> way<00:04:54.050> but<00:04:54.290> it's<00:04:54.560> true

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:54.770 
thought about it that way but it's true

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:56.770 
thought about it that way but it's true
i<00:04:54.800> mean<00:04:54.890> i<00:04:55.100> think<00:04:55.160> with<00:04:55.520> the<00:04:55.790> wind<00:04:56.060> and<00:04:56.330> rain

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:56.780 
i mean i think with the wind and rain

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:59.200 
i mean i think with the wind and rain
and<00:04:57.200> you<00:04:57.770> know<00:04:57.890> coolness<00:04:58.460> and<00:04:58.670> i<00:04:58.790> think<00:04:59.090> it's

00:04:59.200 --> 00:04:59.210 
and you know coolness and i think it's

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:00.820 
and you know coolness and i think it's
them<00:04:59.540> the<00:04:59.840> clade<00:05:00.110> because<00:05:00.500> of<00:05:00.620> the<00:05:00.680> natural

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:00.830 
them the clade because of the natural

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:03.430 
them the clade because of the natural
surface<00:05:01.340> is<00:05:01.700> it<00:05:01.850> is<00:05:02.300> it<00:05:02.600> reacts<00:05:02.990> much<00:05:03.170> more

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:03.440 
surface is it is it reacts much more

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:05.770 
surface is it is it reacts much more
extreme<00:05:03.800> than<00:05:04.160> let's<00:05:05.000> say<00:05:05.060> hardcore<00:05:05.540> would

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:05.780 
extreme than let's say hardcore would

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:07.930 
extreme than let's say hardcore would
even<00:05:06.500> though<00:05:06.590> that<00:05:06.740> also<00:05:07.190> has<00:05:07.340> a<00:05:07.370> bit

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:07.940 
even though that also has a bit

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:09.790 
even though that also has a bit
different<00:05:08.270> feelings<00:05:08.630> to<00:05:08.810> it<00:05:08.900> sometimes<00:05:09.350> but<00:05:09.590> I

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:09.800 
different feelings to it sometimes but I

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:12.190 
different feelings to it sometimes but I
think<00:05:10.100> especially<00:05:10.160> on<00:05:10.580> clays<00:05:10.850> so<00:05:11.210> last<00:05:11.990> year<00:05:12.110> I

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:12.200 
think especially on clays so last year I

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:13.360 
think especially on clays so last year I
paid<00:05:12.380> the<00:05:12.470> price<00:05:12.650> for<00:05:12.710> it<00:05:12.920> maybe<00:05:13.070> you<00:05:13.220> know<00:05:13.280> I

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:13.370 
paid the price for it maybe you know I

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:14.860 
paid the price for it maybe you know I
played<00:05:13.640> against<00:05:13.820> oiling<00:05:14.150> in<00:05:14.300> the<00:05:14.420> rain<00:05:14.570> almost

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:14.870 
played against oiling in the rain almost

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:17.380 
played against oiling in the rain almost
a<00:05:15.080> whole<00:05:15.200> time<00:05:15.440> it's<00:05:15.860> just<00:05:15.920> not<00:05:16.220> as<00:05:16.340> nice<00:05:16.550> later

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:17.390 
a whole time it's just not as nice later

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:19.030 
a whole time it's just not as nice later
when<00:05:17.960> it's<00:05:18.140> here<00:05:18.380> but<00:05:18.470> I<00:05:18.530> mean<00:05:18.710> he<00:05:18.800> played

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:19.040 
when it's here but I mean he played

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:21.190 
when it's here but I mean he played
fantastic<00:05:19.700> and<00:05:19.820> maybe<00:05:20.030> against<00:05:20.480> that<00:05:21.020> kind<00:05:21.110> of

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:21.200 
fantastic and maybe against that kind of

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:23.590 
fantastic and maybe against that kind of
a<00:05:21.290> player<00:05:21.530> and<00:05:22.220> a<00:05:22.280> different<00:05:22.760> condition<00:05:22.910> may

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:23.600 
a player and a different condition may

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:25.570 
a player and a different condition may
might<00:05:24.050> have<00:05:24.170> been<00:05:24.320> better<00:05:24.470> for<00:05:24.620> me<00:05:24.890> but<00:05:25.100> look

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:25.580 
might have been better for me but look

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:27.250 
might have been better for me but look
at<00:05:25.760> me<00:05:25.790> he<00:05:26.000> took<00:05:26.120> advantage<00:05:26.390> of<00:05:26.720> it<00:05:26.900> and<00:05:27.050> it's

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:27.260 
at me he took advantage of it and it's

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.470 
at me he took advantage of it and it's
true<00:05:27.920> that<00:05:28.070> always<00:05:28.490> has<00:05:28.850> it<00:05:29.000> there's<00:05:29.150> a<00:05:29.240> little

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:29.480 
true that always has it there's a little

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:31.840 
true that always has it there's a little
?<00:05:29.840> to<00:05:30.290> how<00:05:30.740> the<00:05:30.800> next<00:05:31.100> day<00:05:31.220> is<00:05:31.310> going<00:05:31.460> to<00:05:31.520> be<00:05:31.640> and
