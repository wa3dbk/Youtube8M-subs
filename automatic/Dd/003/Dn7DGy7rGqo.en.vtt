they practice together on an indoor

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:27.440 
they practice together on an indoor
gymnasium<00:04:25.770> so<00:04:26.370> they<00:04:26.820> said<00:04:27.030> that<00:04:27.150> the<00:04:27.270> weather

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:27.450 
gymnasium so they said that the weather

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:28.760 
gymnasium so they said that the weather
had<00:04:27.660> been<00:04:27.690> giving<00:04:28.080> them<00:04:28.200> quite<00:04:28.440> a<00:04:28.470> bit<00:04:28.680> of

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:28.770 
had been giving them quite a bit of

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:30.500 
had been giving them quite a bit of
trouble<00:04:28.920> and<00:04:29.370> that<00:04:29.910> will<00:04:30.060> discuss<00:04:30.360> the

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:30.510 
trouble and that will discuss the

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:32.210 
trouble and that will discuss the
interview<00:04:30.780> after<00:04:31.050> their<00:04:31.170> performance<00:04:31.290> but<00:04:32.190> i

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:32.220 
interview after their performance but i

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:33.890 
interview after their performance but i
think<00:04:32.670> that<00:04:32.790> they<00:04:32.880> had<00:04:33.000> a<00:04:33.030> very<00:04:33.120> consistent

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:33.900 
think that they had a very consistent

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:36.320 
think that they had a very consistent
turnout<00:04:34.260> that's<00:04:35.190> correct<00:04:35.490> they<00:04:35.940> do<00:04:36.000> they<00:04:36.270> do

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:36.330 
turnout that's correct they do they do

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:38.360 
turnout that's correct they do they do
play<00:04:36.660> a<00:04:36.690> lot<00:04:36.930> indoors<00:04:37.470> so<00:04:37.890> when<00:04:38.070> they<00:04:38.160> come<00:04:38.340> out

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:38.370 
play a lot indoors so when they come out

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:40.190 
play a lot indoors so when they come out
to<00:04:38.550> the<00:04:38.640> conditions<00:04:39.090> words<00:04:39.570> a<00:04:39.780> little<00:04:40.050> bit

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:40.200 
to the conditions words a little bit

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:41.990 
to the conditions words a little bit
windier<00:04:40.560> a<00:04:40.620> little<00:04:40.800> bit<00:04:40.920> gusty<00:04:41.160> it's<00:04:41.790> a<00:04:41.820> little

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000 
windier a little bit gusty it's a little

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.850 
windier a little bit gusty it's a little
more<00:04:42.090> difficult<00:04:42.300> for<00:04:42.600> him<00:04:42.810> but<00:04:43.050> as<00:04:43.350> you<00:04:43.530> see
