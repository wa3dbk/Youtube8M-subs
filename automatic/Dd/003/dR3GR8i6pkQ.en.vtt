00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.450
 I'm going to try it 

00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:07.629
 at this time 

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:08.860
 the salary increase for all 

00:00:07.629 --> 00:00:13.240
 personnel of the national armed force 

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:15.820
 Bolivarian of the year 2013 as part of 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:17.830
 the military workers that are 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:21.000
 you the workers who have the 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:23.810
 weapons of the republic 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.730
 this year 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:30.220
 'we have 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:32.980
 I have come to a linear formula 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:35.739
 we have arrived at a linear formula that 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:38.430
 they will explain the military high command by 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:41.150
 the different communication mechanisms 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:45.950
 that have 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:48.290
 to report a significant increase 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:51.650
 substantial you know that you have to 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:53.900
 combine in the case of salaries and 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:56.690
 wages I know from experience 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:01:01.090
 as a trade unionist and so he talked 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:01.090
 with the admiral in chief 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:07.940
 good if one only advances in 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:12.220
 increases in percentage 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:14.720
 there is a tendency for them to separate 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:16.810
 abruptly the different scales of 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:21.520
 wages that exist 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:24.159
 then the last increase was 40% and 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:26.470
 this increase had an important impact 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:28.720
 we're going to do it linearly and in 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:32.140
 this opportunity will allow to favor 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:35.740
 to the scales of lowest wages thing 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:38.159
 which is understood openly by 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:40.539
 our greatest admiral generals 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:43.899
 Rear Admiral so he's going to have a 

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:45.250
 higher increase the Argentines the 

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:47.700
 lieutenants the first lieutenants 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:50.340
 captains and seniors 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:56.549
 because it's going to be a linear increase that's going 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:59.100
 even allow adjust and improve 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:01.759
 salary table of our armed force 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.759
 Bolivarian national 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.670
 and this is good that we learned it 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:08.270
 supreme commander is something very 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:12.440
 important because 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:14.890
 you are like workers and workers with 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:17.770
 rifles in the hands with tanks 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:20.500
 making homeland every day without 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:23.260
 rest watching the motherland all 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:27.459
 days so this great black mission 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:29.800
 first that has four components 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:31.770
 five fundamental components one of 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:34.530
 they welfare 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:36.810
 and the social protection of our 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:39.390
 soldiers and soldiers and their family 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:42.060
 well let's continue to do us 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.950
 every day the greatest effort that 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.050
 you have the highest level of 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:50.160
 social security care 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:55.530
 tranquility and modest access as 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:58.320
 they have but just worth to happiness 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:00.810
 social to social life so I 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:03.990
 I hope these decisions are 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:06.060
 communicated communicated explained and 

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:10.010
 happen immediately because the 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:12.960
 increase we have applied it with the method 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:15.290
 progressive that is also a method that 

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:18.870
 created the chÃ¡vez commander and is very useful 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:21.000
 to manage the first resources 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:22.360
 of the state and secondly for the 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.220
 economy 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:27.460
 for the economy for handling 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:30.550
 responsible for the economy so a 

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:32.140
 important percentage of this increase goes 

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:35.020
 to enter into force as early as the month of 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:37.060
 May another in September and another in 

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:39.460
 November as was also the 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:41.290
 methodology that was applied for the rest 

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:43.150
 of the workers of the 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:46.960
 country in the rest of the workers is 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:49.630
 applied 20 percent in May that already 

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:52.150
 will be effective 10 percent in 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:53.980
 September and a variable between 5 and 10 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:56.230
 percent according behave as 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:58.690
 the growth of the economy and the 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:02.110
 inflation variable for the month of 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:03.550
 November driving with a lot 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:06.400
 responsibility but also with 

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:09.680
 social justice criterion everything that 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:12.200
 has to see the resources of the state 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:15.290
 the impact it must have to protect 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:17.030
 the salt the life of 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:19.280
 the workers 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:22.970
 Venezuelans and in this case about 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:24.950
 workers who give their whole lives everything 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:28.250
 its time 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:32.170
 and all his love for the defense of our 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:32.170
 sovereignty and the fatherland
