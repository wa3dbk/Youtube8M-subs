00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:06.189
 two 

00:00:01.989 --> 00:00:06.189
 pymes peru 

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:12.430
 then I make ideas I was not up close 

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:14.950
 with you who then says to 

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:18.510
 Minister of Agriculture Milton von Hesse 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:20.630
 and I would say 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.140
 the cooperative has withdrawn us 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:24.869
 exclusively to the cooperative 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.590
 I just do not know if it's from 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:32.750
 the officials or is 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:35.390
 there are indications but the law does not 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:38.000
 see that they accept us because the headquarters 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:40.400
 You can do two years in Andahuaylas him 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.670
 they would appreciate or the government would also 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:46.190
 worry about the environment we 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:48.559
 what do we do with so much that we have the 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:51.020
 hope of surviving to produce 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:54.530
 we are together if the environment is going to 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:58.970
 be impaired by a percentage I do not know 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:01:02.600
 if it is 50 80 90 100 while on one side 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:05.360
 we work, we do not see what we are going 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:07.580
 have a strength a better future and it is 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:10.310
 healthy are authorizing mining 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:13.130
 I just returned from one of these 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:15.610
 heights visiting some communities and 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:19.210
 we found just 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:19.930
 on one side of irresponsibility 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:21.880
 the citizens 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:24.600
 on the other side of authority throwing 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:28.210
 plastic bottles vehicle parts 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.920
 that's a theme the other issue is the evil 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:31.780
 handling of the say of the 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:35.020
 insecticides the pesticides that also 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:37.770
 it's a way to pollute and contribute 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:40.900
 to global warming and third 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:43.240
 definitely download it through you 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:45.280
 incorporate on the work table this 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:47.970
 environmental care campaign 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:50.890
 from our production we shout 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.710
 we ask you to intervene by the 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:55.780
 environment that does not authorize 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.820
 imagine the risk of chalhuanca that 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:00.310
 it was a trout production area 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:02.619
 that now there is not one and I want to make you 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:05.170
 a question the owner has not been 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:06.910
 commented that at the same time that 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:10.119
 planted this plant is at our 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:14.200
 This plant was also planted 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:15.580
 of avocado because let's say the difference in 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.670
 their growth while another day they are 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:19.790
 bearing fruit 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:24.060
 that's how it looks here we're going to see several 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:27.390
 factors we have to see 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:30.390
 how this seedling has been produced and the 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:34.650
 time that this plant has in what 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:37.080
 is the leader phase because this is what 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.900
 which determines in itself a good plant to 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.849
 future is there then where you 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:45.720
 recommends that at the time of 

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:47.730
 select the seed be let's say with 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:51.180
 quality control certification 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:53.790
 quality if we were touching the subject of 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:55.620
 the seed selection that's a 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:59.340
 very important factor that you have to take 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:02.280
 in account and the other thing that needs to be seen 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:05.040
 also very carefully is the management 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:08.240
 that we should give in the nursery phase 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:11.830
 many times we 

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:13.880
 We are producing in low beds and 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:16.040
 using irrigation systems 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:18.610
 flood that that's going to eventually 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:22.340
 harm as what is the presence 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:26.090
 of lafita doctor sinama that after 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:27.680
 many years are going to give the symptoms 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:31.040
 of this disease so that 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:34.099
 later our seedlings 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:37.420
 begin to approach we have seen several 

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:41.560
 of these fallen fruits around 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:44.110
 this one of the main reasons that 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:46.390
 we are seeing is because of the strong 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:51.220
 presence of the winds because there is a 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:54.820
 friction between them and that deserves that 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:57.130
 some fruits are falling and apart 

00:03:54.820 --> 00:04:00.310
 of it that as it goes 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:03.160
 developing these fruits are going to have 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:06.220
 friction between each other between the fruits and 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:09.040
 that also makes me lose what is the 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:10.980
 adequate production but that is 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:13.950
 difficult to control 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:16.530
 yes but I think that we can go 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:18.790
 controlling what is with the one of 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:20.590
 the alternatives would be the 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:25.330
 with the use of live fences 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:27.880
 for a bit avoid the strong presence 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:29.200
 of the wind directly to the plant 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:33.550
 when we speak do code we are 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:35.530
 talking about that bamboo eucalyptus 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:38.080
 what types are we talking for example 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:40.040
 from this here we have the presence of 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:43.249
 angora place 

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:46.729
 that works very well 

00:04:43.249 --> 00:04:49.249
 and we could not suddenly involve 

00:04:46.729 --> 00:04:51.979
 some species that would make it difficult 

00:04:49.249 --> 00:04:55.249
 the production of the crop from part of the 

00:04:51.979 --> 00:04:57.169
 environment what is the eucalyptus very 

00:04:55.249 --> 00:04:59.389
 important to analyze the bamboo not because 

00:04:57.169 --> 00:05:01.399
 it's a very utilitarian product yes yes 

00:04:59.389 --> 00:05:03.049
 we are seeing we are seeing here 

00:05:01.399 --> 00:05:04.879
 when I am speaking the presidency of 

00:05:03.049 --> 00:05:12.050
 Senasa referring to us, we talk about the 

00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:15.480
 fruit to see 1 2 3 4 5 and 6 7 8 9 10 

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:17.910
 10 built-in flies 

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:21.080
 and then these we swear with a 

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:21.080
 insecticide with plasticity 

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:42.789
 how many 1 1 2 3 4 5 6 

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:44.480
 then later we have to be 

00:05:42.789 --> 00:05:48.070
 fumigating 

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:48.070
 every certain period 

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:54.740
 nothing helps us now see it very 

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:57.550
 nice we can not because this 

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:57.550
 fruit 

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:01.729
 we already take the camera 

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:06.240
 we have 

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:08.580
 corroborating what was said by the president 

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:11.099
 of the cooperative we are just 

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:14.729
 here observing against in the process of 

00:06:11.099 --> 00:06:18.090
 construction the center that will be the 

00:06:14.729 --> 00:06:21.030
 collection center for avocados and 

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:23.789
 president has indicated that they will be able 

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:27.030
 cater to all producers who 

00:06:23.789 --> 00:06:29.909
 obviously they have to bring here their 

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:32.009
 production in fact good initiative 

00:06:29.909 --> 00:06:33.569
 is in an important advance as 

00:06:32.009 --> 00:06:37.120
 We can observe with our cameras 

00:06:33.569 --> 00:06:39.910
 still still by the way has not concluded 

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:42.370
 however there is the hope that 

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:45.479
 soon the avocado growers of this 

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:48.280
 valley then have your collection center 

00:06:45.479 --> 00:06:51.340
 meanwhile let's continue with our 

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:55.840
 visit other fields in order to converse 

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:59.260
 with another of the leaders of this 

00:06:55.840 --> 00:07:03.490
 of this production activity of 

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:05.229
 paltas in fact every opinion of them is 

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:08.380
 very important to us is 

00:07:05.229 --> 00:07:12.100
 important for development in the 

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:15.310
 the pastoral sector market and that is why 

00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:17.440
 that we are reiterating doing our 

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:19.690
 visit to each space both in the 

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:22.949
 fields like in this case in the center of 

00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:22.949
 production and storing 

00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:27.500
