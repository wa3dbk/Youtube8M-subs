00:00:00.949 --> 00:00:05.370
 the arrival of this huge rotorcraft 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.859
 cars in Kazakhstan in the Ministry of Emergency 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.630
 waited a year and a half after the upgrade 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.030
 almost complete refit to 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.250
 in Novosibirsk in 26 became almost like 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.719
 new at the time of the collapse of the Soviet Union 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.090
 large remains in kazakhstan 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.100
 grouping numbering 24 such 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.090
 the helicopters that were deployed in 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.529
 trance after withdrawal from afghanistan 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.600
 Soviet troops 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.220
 however, in the 90s due to its 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.740
 lack of demand and lack of money 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.240
 such services all our mi-26 steel 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.279
 unfit for use 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.930
 a few years ago two helicopters 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.160
 restored at the Moscow aircraft factory 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.350
 for the ministry of defense 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:42.030
 he is now his own air cargo 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:45.920
 appeared and have mischief for us and it's a span 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:48.480
 is one of the leading in our 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:51.420
 Samantha Motor Park because he 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:54.180
 can carry up to 20 tons of cargo on 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:57.120
 suspension up to 15 tons at the same time 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.530
 can be carried by stomping 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.289
 brew like not that to us 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:04.350
 it is necessary to fill various sections 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:06.090
 let's say other us -2 helicopters 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.850
 considered a legendary car on it 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.740
 11 world records set sizes 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.630
 helicopters actually hit the lead 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.240
 the diameter of its rotor consisting 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.280
 of eight blades is 32 meters 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.610
 which is equal to the wingspan of the passenger 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.530
 boeing 737 this ice can at once 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.689
 carry up to 20 tons of cargo including 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.880
 and on the outside of the inside can 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.799
 accommodate a company of paratroopers or 60 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.150
 stretcher with wounded similar parameters 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.159
 do mi-26 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.170
 the indispensable case of major emergency 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.439
 situations we have a lot of work 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:40.979
 just building this new technique 

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:43.290
 crew and flight training is required 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.720
 composition and slide composition stitchs 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:49.470
 but touched us have we spent 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:52.470
 training three 3 crews here but 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:55.470
 now it is necessary to operate one crew 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.579
 we had time and sisters but remained still hanging 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.520
 two crews therefore 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:00.869
 work haunting very much 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.850
 the recovery story is also curious 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.049
 helicopter in march of the twelfth year he is in 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.460
 unassembled was transported 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:07.920
 Novosibirsk on the external suspension 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.810
 similar Russian MI-26 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.660
 it became a unique transport 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.430
 operations 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.320
 the return helicopter came under its own power 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.770
 and piloted the Kazakh type 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:19.060
 prepared by utair 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:21.040
 Now at the aircraft plant in Novosibirsk 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:23.530
 another mi-26 is being completed 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.090
 for Kazakhstani emergency situations he will go to 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:26.320
 Kazakhstan end of November and will 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:28.630
 to be based in Atyrau 

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:29.620
 main task 2 cars part in 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:31.930
 eliminate possible emergency 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:34.960
 oil development situations 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:36.100
 of the Caspian region, Gregory Bedenko 

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:38.370
 Sergeant Jumabayev 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.370
