00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
we got these snow guys that slip and

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:10.810 
we got these snow guys that slip and
slide<00:02:09.380> all<00:02:09.410> over<00:02:09.649> the<00:02:09.950> place<00:02:10.070> they're<00:02:10.580> kind<00:02:10.729> of

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:10.820 
slide all over the place they're kind of

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:12.550 
slide all over the place they're kind of
unpredictable<00:02:11.390> and<00:02:11.570> they<00:02:11.630> can<00:02:11.780> skip<00:02:12.020> skip

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
unpredictable and they can skip skip

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.900 
unpredictable and they can skip skip
across<00:02:12.710> gaps<00:02:13.190> to<00:02:13.570> like<00:02:14.570> that<00:02:14.750> see<00:02:15.080> that<00:02:15.230> yeah

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
across gaps to like that see that yeah

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:17.740 
across gaps to like that see that yeah
so<00:02:16.910> just<00:02:17.120> when<00:02:17.210> you<00:02:17.330> think<00:02:17.480> they're<00:02:17.630> gonna

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
so just when you think they're gonna

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:19.780 
so just when you think they're gonna
fall<00:02:18.080> they're<00:02:18.320> not<00:02:18.440> gonna<00:02:18.590> fall<00:02:18.860> they<00:02:19.340> survive

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
fall they're not gonna fall they survive

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:21.930 
fall they're not gonna fall they survive
and<00:02:20.450> you<00:02:20.510> got<00:02:20.630> to<00:02:20.720> do<00:02:20.840> a<00:02:20.870> little<00:02:21.050> tricky<00:02:21.500> low

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
and you got to do a little tricky low

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.400 
and you got to do a little tricky low
tricky<00:02:22.940> little<00:02:23.090> thing<00:02:23.240> there<00:02:23.660> and<00:02:23.690> go<00:02:24.200> right

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
tricky little thing there and go right

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:27.370 
tricky little thing there and go right
down<00:02:24.620> there<00:02:24.980> and<00:02:25.190> grab<00:02:25.370> the<00:02:25.640> spaceship<00:02:26.380> plant

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:27.380

down there and grab the spaceship plant
whatever<00:02:27.709> I<00:02:28.070> guess<00:02:28.430> spaceships<00:02:29.000> now<00:02:29.240> grow<00:02:29.510> on

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:29.660 
whatever I guess spaceships now grow on

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:31.380 
whatever I guess spaceships now grow on
the<00:02:29.810> ground<00:02:30.050> there's<00:02:30.320> something<00:02:30.709> evidently
