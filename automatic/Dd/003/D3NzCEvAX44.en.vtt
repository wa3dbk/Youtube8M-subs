let's see let's move it actually over
here<00:06:28.690> so<00:06:29.690> create<00:06:30.230> right<00:06:30.380> there<00:06:30.590> and<00:06:30.890> as<00:06:31.430> you

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:31.610 
here so create right there and as you

here so create right there and as you
see<00:06:31.820> you<00:06:31.940> got<00:06:32.120> this<00:06:32.300> nice<00:06:32.570> little<00:06:32.810> block

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:33.290 
see you got this nice little block

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:36.640 
see you got this nice little block
that's<00:06:34.130> like<00:06:34.250> a<00:06:34.370> prison<00:06:34.850> are<00:06:35.030> a<00:06:35.060> pillar<00:06:35.650> move

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:36.650

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:38.430 
that's like a prison are a pillar move
it<00:06:36.800> so<00:06:37.010> it's<00:06:37.160> about<00:06:37.280> the<00:06:37.610> height<00:06:37.850> of<00:06:37.880> a<00:06:38.180> person

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:38.440

looks like press ENTER and let's change

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:53.530 
looks like press ENTER and let's change
the<00:06:50.480> texture<00:06:50.840> so<00:06:51.260> shift<00:06:51.680> a<00:06:51.950> browse<00:06:52.640> to<00:06:53.300> some

00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:53.540 
the texture so shift a browse to some

00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:55.930 
the texture so shift a browse to some
sort<00:06:53.690> of<00:06:53.720> concrete<00:06:54.460> let's<00:06:55.460> make<00:06:55.610> it<00:06:55.670> like<00:06:55.910> a

00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:55.940 
sort of concrete let's make it like a

00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:58.690 
sort of concrete let's make it like a
cool<00:06:56.480> concrete<00:06:57.080> press<00:06:57.290> apply<00:06:57.530> so<00:06:58.430> now<00:06:58.520> we<00:06:58.580> have

00:06:58.690 --> 00:06:58.700 
cool concrete press apply so now we have

00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:01.300 
cool concrete press apply so now we have
this<00:06:58.820> block<00:06:59.180> what<00:07:00.080> we<00:07:00.200> want<00:07:00.410> to<00:07:00.500> do<00:07:00.650> is<00:07:00.950> create

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:01.310 
this block what we want to do is create

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:04.420 
this block what we want to do is create
a<00:07:01.400> button<00:07:02.300> for<00:07:02.630> that<00:07:02.750> block<00:07:03.020> so<00:07:03.410> zoom<00:07:04.250> it<00:07:04.400> in

00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:04.430 
a button for that block so zoom it in

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:06.430 
a button for that block so zoom it in
the<00:07:04.580> bird's<00:07:04.790> eye<00:07:04.910> view<00:07:04.940> hold<00:07:05.450> on<00:07:05.510> to<00:07:05.600> alt<00:07:05.780> and

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:06.440 
the bird's eye view hold on to alt and

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:09.010 
the bird's eye view hold on to alt and
make<00:07:06.590> it<00:07:06.740> little<00:07:07.270> walk<00:07:08.270> like<00:07:08.480> that<00:07:08.510> but<00:07:08.960> you

00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:09.020 
make it little walk like that but you

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:10.570 
make it little walk like that but you
see<00:07:09.170> it's<00:07:09.290> too<00:07:09.440> tall<00:07:09.710> so<00:07:10.130> what<00:07:10.250> we're<00:07:10.370> going<00:07:10.460> to

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:10.580 
see it's too tall so what we're going to

different concrete so maybe a lighter
concrete<00:07:27.320> press<00:07:27.650> apply<00:07:27.890> so<00:07:28.850> now<00:07:28.940> you<00:07:29.000> can<00:07:29.210> see

00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:29.330 
concrete press apply so now you can see

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:32.110 
concrete press apply so now you can see
it<00:07:29.420> looks<00:07:29.510> like<00:07:29.630> a<00:07:29.720> button
