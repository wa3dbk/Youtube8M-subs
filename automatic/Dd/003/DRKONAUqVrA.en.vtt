00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:12.900
 hello hello dear friends with you and 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:16.650
 Claire and today we have a review on 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:18.510
 messerschmitt 410 harley are watching 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.609
 distinguished by excellent firepower and 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.710
 precision good turrets 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:25.320
 and good altitude you of the minuses 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.119
 You can select not the largest 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.779
 maneuverability and not the highest 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.570
 speed 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.830
 as always compare characteristics 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:33.380
 planes level six you can 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.239
 pause video 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:38.219
 as you see we have an excellent stock 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.379
 strength excellent firepower and 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.989
 good optimal speed but to 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.940
 Unfortunately, we lose all weight in 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.940
 maneuverability therefore maneuverable combat 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.320
 absolutely not our choice 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:51.690
 let's talk about ribbons 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.629
 incendiary we take for machine guns 792 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.460
 for 20 we take armor piercing if you fly 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.829
 complete with my thirty something, too, 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.870
 put on them armor-piercing and equipment 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:04.080
 we take a straightforward manual restart 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.430
 fire extinguisher and and dressing bag of 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.500
 equipment all standard 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.990
 we install varnish coatings reinforced 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.630
 trim and their improved sight 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.460
 We just pump everything over the modules 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.890
 first engine then extra 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:20.009
 twenties then top engine well and 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:22.920
 if you want thirty pilot perks 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:25.890
 we put the standard improved review from 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.630
 motors sniper farther by 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.310
 Germany has no onboard arrow therefore 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.399
 on-board shooter can only come in handy 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.020
 on bf 110 c6 if it is bought from you or you 

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:36.840
 you can leave him in the barracks 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.420
 for example German stormtroopers 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:42.180
 which is possible when they appear with 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.310
 these calculations, we establish the following 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.420
 perks improved visibility keen eye 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.820
 keen eye 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.700
 Well, then pump over the remaining 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:53.060
 mentor on this with a hangar all and 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.740
 go to battle 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:57.929
 I want to draw your attention to the composition 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.030
 teams have a lot of opponents Frederick 

00:01:57.929 --> 00:02:02.789
 of there are mosquitoes there are 410 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.350
 if 410 we can still fight if 

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:06.690
 for example he is with thirty me to my 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.729
 we twist the here for example grease that 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:11.190
 fighting is already difficult if we climb on 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.200
 his ceiling then he feels himself on it 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.360
 good enough and we twists and 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.650
 it also surpasses therefore 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.900
 you need to fight with him very carefully 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:23.030
 try to drag him under the allies 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.030
 ask for help don't forget about it 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:41.020
 so you see our task now 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:43.210
 is to destroy and choles 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:45.430
 who came here and did not give for 

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:48.880
 tear your headquarters unfortunately here appeared 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:51.910
 lacquer 3 regret for him we destroy and 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:54.280
 we see further Ella who flew very 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:55.930
 low so we didn't notice our 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:59.880
 the priority is destroy it 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:59.880
 years that he blows up our headquarters 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:38.400
 after we are done with everyone 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.710
 chores from all the light fighters 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.720
 who took to our base we must 

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:45.330
 gain the highest possible height and 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:47.700
 fly to the center of the map naturally there 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:49.770
 there will be many opponents so we 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:54.740
 you need to keep your height as you can 

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:54.740
 taller and destroy first the tall men 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:11.129
 so we have gained the height that we need 

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:12.629
 naturally we take in provided those goals 

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:15.540
 who are exactly at this height 

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:16.709
 we have here 410 on unfortunately for him 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:18.810
 I can't get there 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:21.180
 but I notice fredrika who flies 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:23.759
 up gradually losing speed he 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:26.490
 f4u destroyed one also flies in a straight line 

00:04:23.759 --> 00:04:30.350
 does not attempt to maneuver even after 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:30.350
 my attack and his wing takes off 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:42.020
 after 2 spent and so much we 

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:42.020
 lost height so you need to gain it 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:03.819
 I was lucky opponents got off my 

00:05:01.449 --> 00:05:08.220
 tail and I go on top of the spitfire 

00:05:03.819 --> 00:05:08.220
 I start the attack and it bursts too 

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:24.009
 naturally after maneuver and again 

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:26.560
 gaining height i see our 

00:05:24.009 --> 00:05:29.050
 ally problem trying to help him with 

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:31.830
 frederick starting attack and frederick 

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:31.830
 destroy 

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:56.840
 atsky 88 working off in a straight line doing 

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:58.730
 vertical maneuver and a is mine 

00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:01.690
 actually so kill her 

00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:01.690
 easy enough 

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:14.840
 replay plan fit ring i will 

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:17.030
 sum up the 410 is a great car 

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:18.800
 with excellent powerful weapons with good 

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:19.700
 optimal Kai and with a good margin 

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:21.710
 strength 

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:23.390
 the main thing when playing it is not to step 

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:25.340
 maneuvering battle with other strands and 

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:26.720
 light fighters kill them on 

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:29.150
 aisles and mushrooms zoom 

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:31.810
 on this I had everything with you and shaken up 

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:31.810
 see you soon
