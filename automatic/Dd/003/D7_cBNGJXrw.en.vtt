 Al Qaeda branch is considered 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.850
 the most deadly region 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.619
 are their sworn enemies 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.140
 sole force and capable 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.119
 confront them the united states do not accept 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.640
 direct participation in air strikes on 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:28.560
 represent intelligence data exist 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.140
 serious fears that america will want 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.939
 get your outposts back in time 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.740
 Yemen pass the most important routes 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:36.090
 oil transportation which is now 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.250
 are at risk because 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.600
 bombardment 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:41.130
 Many experts believe that precisely those 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.229
 only prices for the confrontation between 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.090
 Gulf countries and Iran 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:47.159
 deputy foreign minister 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.259
 Iran in an exclusive interview rt 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:53.159
 outlined the position of Tehran on the situation 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:55.350
 time, we think that the way out 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.450
 which has developed in Yemen should wear 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.100
 purely political nature we 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.200
 let's say so surprised that 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.390
 some foreign states lead 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.250
 military campaign of time we know what 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.140
 military intervention of foreign forces is not 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.179
 just won't solve the problem but even more 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.069
 complicate the situation we believe that in 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.960
 Yemen should be held constructive 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.730
 conversation 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:15.710
 countries of the region including saudi 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.810
 Arabia should not interfere with political 

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:19.760
 process and we are ready to contribute to it 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.620
 in this country we do not believe that 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.020
 time conflict there is a military solution 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.880
 we are also against military assistance 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:27.620
 to the rebels of the hackits we will not 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.780
 contribute to the unleashing of the military 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.850
 action in the country we are sure that Yemen 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:33.620
 belongs to all its citizens and neither 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:34.190
 one group is not one can not 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.890
 dominate 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:38.690
 Ansar Allah supports the population of the people 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:40.550
 It is with respect to the leaders 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:42.800
 this movement is the only solution 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:46.870
 Yemeni question this arrangement and 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:46.870
 political partnership of all groups
