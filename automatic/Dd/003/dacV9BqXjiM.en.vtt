00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.989
 is simply because I 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.620

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.290
 rest on one's laurels should never 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.459

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.790

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:39.930
 series the judge rots them for a purpose 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:41.769
 in all modesty 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.330
 normal when to make them a blink 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:44.620

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:48.180
 word since it's an artist 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:50.530

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:04.000
 nice pieces offered by these two 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:12.190
 magistrates become of the sea ​​very good 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:13.989
 case is beginning to be written off in 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:15.220
 doing my talk about my guests from 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:17.400
 I also proves you right now 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:19.209
 my mixtape she kept noting that iad and 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:22.230
 here are some very great artists 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:24.430
 in this mixtape a nessbeal example 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:26.079
 city ​​here is for me who is an artist 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:27.970
 that I listened to young people who have him 

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:30.310
 also rocked my youth that I appreciate 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:32.620
 which I appreciate very much humanly and 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:34.510
 artistically speaking in the amp and 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:36.790
 in 2012 he appeared to me in no 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:37.610
 project except last m and that's when 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:39.320
 even 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:40.730
 a big head of french rap promonet 

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:44.990
 this goal I prefer to talk about that 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:48.950
 yeah we talk about something else small 

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:50.270
 just for fear of this case we will not 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:52.370
 to lie to himself that Catalans do not want 

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:53.450
 the big ones well when you see the 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:57.020
 phenomenon of tan 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:57.530
 pastore it's frankly it's not but 

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:59.390
 it's magic 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:00.440
 already like that was magic but there 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:02.810
 it's still magic because when you 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:04.250
 look here are the games of talking to me 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:08.030
 I tell myself that in two or three 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:11.750
 four years I think and 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:14.390
 I think that to be able to compete 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:16.970
 with big big teams 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:18.560
 for example me frankly from the website of 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:20.269
 three years it would not surprise me to see a 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:22.700
 real bet is to see a draw even 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:25.220
 1 0 bets where it's a very tight match 

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:27.470
 and while knowing that the real the barça 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:29.630
 cds really teams 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:30.680
 and when we must when we see paris 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:31.910
 today I tell myself that it is 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:36.280
 promising and frankly I think that 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:36.280
 qatar have done a great job at the club
