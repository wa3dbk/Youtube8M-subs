00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.680
 hello you love here he speaks k i 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.960
 I am very happy for you there too 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:11.420
 his and today again on a topic 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:14.070
 it will just be so crazy to talk 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:16.320
 total passion is I'm a 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.699
 great advocates of the green again and 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.760
 Of course nothing special that that 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:23.490
 wild greens but today comes the the 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.680
 small step below the wild green is 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.480
 The kale and kale is one 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.400
 fantastic food 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.720
 that is out of strange invent me 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.969
 inexplicable reasons in germany 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.770
 Mainly always in winter because 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.550
 that grows in costa rica with us 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.260
 all year round 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.809
 So there is no real reason 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.390
 The farmer has started the mini-vans 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.770
 cold frost outside is so grow up 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.629
 kale it should be the whole thing 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.800
 could give year to grow or 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.750
 inspire your farmers around the corner 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:54.440
 to grow that 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:58.620
 So I like you a few today 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:01:03.149
 Healthy and tasty methods show how 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:05.030
 your kale in your diet with 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.740
 could integrate number one 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:09.810
 Of course, the green juices 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.310
 that is the simplest way and 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.830
 the most efficient way we do 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.689
 have every day or almost every day 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.729
 kale and even I do not like myself 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.960
 maximum like the green a bit 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.340
 to alternate is if I always that 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.530
 but kale really have the same 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.340
 an integral component of our diet Us 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.470
 nutritional form 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.240
 and if you can hold a few more somehow 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.400
 fruits in the juice with or adds 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.290
 Just sweeter vegetables like 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.579
 carrots for example then you can 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.200
 me also really good taste 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:37.979
 get it done and just these many 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.240
 nutrients and vitamins right here 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.340
 make available 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.399
 the green is the wild green especially 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.390
 is the most nutritious that is 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.899
 not the most nutritious 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.850
 foods of the world and like that 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.110
 many do not hear because there is no money 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.930
 co-earn because they are free 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:57.210
 outside the world is a green planet 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.979
 everything green 80 90 of the green what you 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.899
 look at why you can run 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:04.060
 eat and it is the best food 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:06.520
 there is kale is the conventional 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:09.130
 forum but in principle we are exactly 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:11.530
 the same super high and minerals 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:14.800
 vitamins vitamin protein i hold 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:16.390
 even vital substances to the best 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.739
 food that is so again 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.849
 One was the set number 2 course 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:21.760
 simply as a salad 

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:23.620
 you can just make salads with it 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:27.040
 and stop with other vegetables 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:28.090
 mix or just a nice yummy 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.010
 make dressing 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.630
 furthermore we love that it is ish 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:34.480
 degree in the states where we are 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:42.580
 everyday kale chips are the easy ones 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:44.410
 with a lard of paprika salt sauce too 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:45.700
 drink and throw a wire 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:48.220
 or an oven mostly on kale 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.810
 make chips from it's number four 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:54.580
 It is easy to get into instead of 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:56.140
 burrito or a rap red what you take 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:58.030
 quasi shows abroad where you are in 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:00.220
 reinpackt things and instead one is 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:04.780
 Somehow, gluten bread takes over that 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:07.120
 to pack things and kale 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.769
 sheet also a very good kind and 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:11.410
 as of course to make as 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:13.630
 musicians can use it as the 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:15.040
 in contrast to the juice it is in 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:17.290
 smoothie is just a word for the leaf and the word 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:19.510
 bananas all together mixa off 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:20.500
 from mixed and drinking and as a juice 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:22.540
 would you just stop because they only 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.010
 Extract plant juice is the 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:26.819
 difference between smoothie and that 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:30.220
 juice and the juice 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:35.500
 yes that were 1 6 6 different kind and 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:38.260
 Show how easy and tasty more 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:40.150
 Kale and over there add a diet 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:42.000
