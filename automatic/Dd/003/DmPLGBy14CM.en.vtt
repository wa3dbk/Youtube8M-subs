short space of time what happens is that

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.750 
short space of time what happens is that
not<00:01:13.229> only<00:01:13.500> does<00:01:13.619> the<00:01:13.740> water<00:01:13.920> run<00:01:14.490> away<00:01:14.700> from

not only does the water run away from

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.999 
not only does the water run away from
the<00:01:15.030> farm<00:01:15.270> but<00:01:15.750> it<00:01:15.869> takes<00:01:16.049> the<00:01:16.200> most<00:01:16.350> the<00:01:16.830> most

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
the farm but it takes the most the most

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.550 
the farm but it takes the most the most
fertile<00:01:17.220> soil<00:01:18.210> from<00:01:18.689> the<00:01:18.780> farm<00:01:18.990> as<00:01:19.170> well

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
fertile soil from the farm as well

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.830 
fertile soil from the farm as well
so<00:01:20.250> the<00:01:20.369> first<00:01:20.610> step<00:01:20.820> has<00:01:20.970> got<00:01:21.180> to<00:01:21.330> be<00:01:21.450> not<00:01:21.659> to

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
so the first step has got to be not to

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.810 
so the first step has got to be not to
capture<00:01:22.049> water<00:01:22.350> in<00:01:22.530> the<00:01:22.619> valleys<00:01:22.950> but<00:01:23.670> to

capture water in the valleys but to

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.580 
capture water in the valleys but to

capture water first of all in the farms
that's<00:01:26.280> the<00:01:26.430> way<00:01:26.549> in<00:01:26.640> which<00:01:26.759> they're<00:01:26.939> going<00:01:27.119> to

the clouds there is much more do you now
hear<00:04:05.470> and<00:04:05.620> also<00:04:06.459> the<00:04:06.819> birds<00:04:07.150> and<00:04:07.799> the<00:04:08.799> insects

00:04:09.509 --> 00:04:09.519 
hear and also the birds and the insects

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:11.550 
hear and also the birds and the insects
and<00:04:09.730> the<00:04:09.790> wind<00:04:10.030> are<00:04:10.269> bringing<00:04:10.660> more<00:04:10.900> seed<00:04:11.200> here

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:11.560 
and the wind are bringing more seed here

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:14.370 
and the wind are bringing more seed here
so<00:04:12.130> what<00:04:12.280> is<00:04:12.400> happening<00:04:12.819> here<00:04:13.419> is<00:04:13.599> that<00:04:13.780> over

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:14.380 
so what is happening here is that over

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:17.699 
so what is happening here is that over
the<00:04:14.620> last<00:04:14.769> 25<00:04:15.280> years<00:04:15.389> this<00:04:16.389> climatic<00:04:16.900> zone<00:04:17.320> has

to be spread across the board would

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:33.390 
to be spread across the board would

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.500 
benefits of soil and water conservation
can<00:04:38.650> clearly<00:04:39.010> be<00:04:39.160> seen<00:04:39.490> in<00:04:39.669> these<00:04:39.850> pictures<00:04:40.210> of

July 1984 there and after several dams
were<00:04:47.260> built<00:04:47.290> in<00:04:47.590> the<00:04:47.680> valley<00:04:47.860> in<00:04:48.070> 1985<00:04:48.910> the

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:49.270 
were built in the valley in 1985 the

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:53.100 
were built in the valley in 1985 the
impact<00:04:49.720> was<00:04:49.870> obvious<00:04:50.410> in<00:04:50.919> August<00:04:51.370> 2002<00:04:52.270> these

conventional thinking on development is

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:02.070 
conventional thinking on development is

that development needs to be inhibited

that development needs to be inhibited
in<00:05:02.710> order<00:05:03.010> to<00:05:03.160> protect<00:05:03.520> the<00:05:03.850> environment
