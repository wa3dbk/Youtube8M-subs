00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
so at the end of the game the whole

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.240 
so at the end of the game the whole
starting<00:03:01.050> five<00:03:01.320> was<00:03:01.590> jumping<00:03:01.950> up<00:03:02.010> together

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:13.190 
of the bench so they all jumped out
right<00:03:11.610> at<00:03:11.760> the<00:03:11.850> same<00:03:12.060> time<00:03:12.300> right<00:03:12.600> towards<00:03:12.660> me
