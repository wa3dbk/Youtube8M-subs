00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:07.670 
section out this large triangle it

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:09.490 
section out this large triangle it
starts<00:02:08.090> just<00:02:08.390> behind<00:02:08.660> the<00:02:08.840> high<00:02:08.959> point<00:02:09.259> of<00:02:09.380> the

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500 
starts just behind the high point of the

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.110 
starts just behind the high point of the
head<00:02:09.679> which<00:02:09.860> we<00:02:10.010> did<00:02:10.130> by<00:02:10.220> balancing<00:02:10.519> the<00:02:10.850> comb

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
head which we did by balancing the comb

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.120 
head which we did by balancing the comb
we<00:02:11.450> did<00:02:11.660> by<00:02:11.810> balancing<00:02:12.110> our<00:02:12.410> comb<00:02:12.590> finding<00:02:13.040> the

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
we did by balancing our comb finding the

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:14.710 
we did by balancing our comb finding the
high<00:02:13.250> point<00:02:13.549> going<00:02:13.760> back<00:02:14.030> one<00:02:14.269> inch<00:02:14.480> and<00:02:14.690> a

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
high point going back one inch and a

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.300 
high point going back one inch and a
little<00:02:14.870> bit<00:02:14.959> over<00:02:15.170> to<00:02:15.260> the<00:02:15.350> left<00:02:15.560> and<00:02:15.769> we

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
little bit over to the left and we

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.220 
little bit over to the left and we
created<00:02:16.519> a<00:02:16.670> slightly<00:02:16.940> asymmetric<00:02:17.690> triangle

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
created a slightly asymmetric triangle

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.110 
created a slightly asymmetric triangle
alright<00:02:18.620> I'm<00:02:18.830> combing<00:02:19.130> that<00:02:19.430> all<00:02:19.610> down<00:02:19.910> and

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120

00:02:26.289 --> 00:02:26.299 
yes oh it's right on the floor actually

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:27.370 
yes oh it's right on the floor actually
why<00:02:26.360> what's<00:02:26.540> down<00:02:26.720> there<00:02:26.870> you<00:02:27.049> know<00:02:27.140> I<00:02:27.170> want<00:02:27.350> to

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
try I just want to try this to see if it

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:31.570 
try I just want to try this to see if it
makes<00:02:29.540> any<00:02:29.720> sense<00:02:29.930> how<00:02:30.709> does<00:02:30.860> it<00:02:30.980> going<00:02:31.220> but

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 
makes any sense how does it going but

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:33.009 
makes any sense how does it going but
that's<00:02:31.760> not<00:02:31.820> straight<00:02:32.180> awesome<00:02:32.480> now<00:02:32.660> can<00:02:32.900> you

00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:33.019 
that's not straight awesome now can you

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:35.710 
that's not straight awesome now can you
walk<00:02:33.230> walk<00:02:34.130> by<00:02:34.430> then<00:02:34.640> and<00:02:34.850> then<00:02:35.420> you<00:02:35.510> could<00:02:35.630> be

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
walk walk by then and then you could be

if i was a bit taller so is that the
hype<00:02:39.620> I'm<00:02:39.950> it<00:02:40.580> needs<00:02:40.880> to<00:02:40.970> be<00:02:41.060> sort<00:02:41.239> of<00:02:41.269> more

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 
hype I'm it needs to be sort of more

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:42.789
