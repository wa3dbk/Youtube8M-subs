again and again but this time instead of
a<00:03:18.239> turning<00:03:18.600> a<00:03:18.690> half<00:03:18.989> it<00:03:19.680> will<00:03:19.950> be<00:03:20.100> a<00:03:20.130> full<00:03:20.489> turn

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
a turning a half it will be a full turn

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:24.680 
a turning a half it will be a full turn
and<00:03:21.739> will<00:03:22.739> scoot<00:03:23.040> over<00:03:23.220> to<00:03:23.760> our<00:03:23.970> right<00:03:24.270> two

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
and will scoot over to our right two

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:29.750 
and will scoot over to our right two
times<00:03:24.959> so<00:03:25.350> let's<00:03:25.530> make<00:03:25.709> that<00:03:25.860> full<00:03:26.160> turn<00:03:28.760> scoop

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
times so let's make that full turn scoop

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:34.790 
times so let's make that full turn scoop
scoop<00:03:30.180> -<00:03:30.540> you're<00:03:30.720> right<00:03:31.760> scoop<00:03:33.500> then<00:03:34.500> to<00:03:34.680> the

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:34.800 
scoop - you're right scoop then to the

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:37.640 
scoop - you're right scoop then to the
left<00:03:35.300> you're<00:03:36.300> going<00:03:36.420> to<00:03:36.480> fake<00:03:36.720> it<00:03:36.870> out<00:03:36.989> meaning

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
left you're going to fake it out meaning

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:38.960 
left you're going to fake it out meaning
you're<00:03:37.739> going<00:03:37.769> to<00:03:37.980> step<00:03:38.190> out<00:03:38.400> twice<00:03:38.700> but

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
you're going to step out twice but

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:42.590 
you're going to step out twice but
you're<00:03:39.150> not<00:03:39.269> really<00:03:39.510> going<00:03:39.720> to<00:03:39.810> go<00:03:40.019> and<00:03:41.600> then

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:42.600 
you're not really going to go and then

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.840 
you're not really going to go and then
you're<00:03:42.900> going<00:03:43.050> to<00:03:43.200> count<00:03:43.560> six<00:03:43.950> turning<00:03:44.670> to

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:44.850 
you're going to count six turning to

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:51.520 
you're going to count six turning to
your<00:03:45.000> right<00:03:45.620> one<00:03:46.620> two<00:03:47.550> three<00:03:48.410> four<00:03:49.410> five<00:03:50.340> six

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:51.530 
your right one two three four five six

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:53.870 
your right one two three four five six
you<00:03:52.530> gotta<00:03:52.709> fake<00:03:53.010> it<00:03:53.040> out<00:03:53.280> again<00:03:53.609> with<00:03:53.790> your

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:53.880 
you gotta fake it out again with your

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:55.240 
you gotta fake it out again with your
left<00:03:53.940> foot

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:55.250 
left foot

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:57.480 
left foot
going<00:03:56.250> out<00:03:56.400> twice

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:57.490 
going out twice

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:59.550 
going out twice
and<00:03:57.580> then<00:03:58.330> you're<00:03:58.480> going<00:03:58.660> to<00:03:58.780> spin<00:03:59.050> it<00:03:59.080> this<00:03:59.380> is

00:03:59.550 --> 00:03:59.560 
and then you're going to spin it this is

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:01.020 
and then you're going to spin it this is
tricky<00:03:59.950> it's<00:04:00.100> almost<00:04:00.430> like<00:04:00.700> you're<00:04:00.880> on<00:04:01.000> a

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:01.030 
tricky it's almost like you're on a

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:04.010 
tricky it's almost like you're on a
skateboard<00:04:01.530> watch<00:04:02.530> the<00:04:02.860> feet

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:04.020 
skateboard watch the feet

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:08.730 
skateboard watch the feet
spin<00:04:05.400> spin<00:04:06.400> all<00:04:07.120> my<00:04:07.450> weight<00:04:07.750> is<00:04:08.020> in<00:04:08.260> my<00:04:08.470> right

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:08.740 
spin spin all my weight is in my right

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:11.970 
spin spin all my weight is in my right
leg<00:04:09.070> I<00:04:09.520> have<00:04:10.150> to<00:04:10.660> shift<00:04:10.960> it<00:04:11.200> over<00:04:11.320> so<00:04:11.800> that<00:04:11.830> I

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:11.980 
leg I have to shift it over so that I

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:17.100 
leg I have to shift it over so that I
can<00:04:12.220> go<00:04:12.810> cross<00:04:13.810> left<00:04:14.440> cross<00:04:15.209> right<00:04:16.209> because

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:17.110 
can go cross left cross right because

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:18.690 
can go cross left cross right because
that's<00:04:17.290> the<00:04:17.440> beginning<00:04:17.620> of<00:04:18.070> the<00:04:18.130> slide<00:04:18.250> again

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:18.700 
that's the beginning of the slide again

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:21.390 
that's the beginning of the slide again
so<00:04:19.510> we<00:04:19.690> just<00:04:19.900> completed<00:04:20.500> a<00:04:20.650> full<00:04:20.980> rotation

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:21.400 
so we just completed a full rotation

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:24.600 
so we just completed a full rotation
that's<00:04:22.180> called<00:04:22.420> one<00:04:22.750> rotation<00:04:23.350> do<00:04:24.040> it<00:04:24.220> with<00:04:24.430> us

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:24.610 
that's called one rotation do it with us

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:26.010 
that's called one rotation do it with us

ok<00:05:44.710> another<00:05:45.010> part<00:05:45.400> of<00:05:45.490> our<00:05:45.790> slide<00:05:46.450> is<00:05:46.810> called

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:47.080 
ok another part of our slide is called

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:50.550 
ok another part of our slide is called
the<00:05:47.260> bridge<00:05:47.560> remember<00:05:48.460> and<00:05:48.780> so<00:05:49.780> I'm<00:05:50.110> going<00:05:50.440> to

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:50.560 
the bridge remember and so I'm going to

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:53.580 
the bridge remember and so I'm going to
demonstrate<00:05:51.310> where<00:05:51.580> the<00:05:51.700> bridge<00:05:51.970> comes<00:05:52.540> in<00:05:52.930> do

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:53.590 
demonstrate where the bridge comes in do

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:55.350 
demonstrate where the bridge comes in do
you<00:05:53.680> remember<00:05:53.980> this<00:05:54.250> piece<00:05:54.550> we're<00:05:54.850> faking<00:05:55.240> it

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:55.360 
you remember this piece we're faking it

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:57.950 
you remember this piece we're faking it
out<00:05:55.480> on<00:05:55.660> our<00:05:55.810> left<00:05:56.110> pick<00:05:56.920> it<00:05:57.100> out

00:05:57.950 --> 00:05:57.960 
out on our left pick it out
