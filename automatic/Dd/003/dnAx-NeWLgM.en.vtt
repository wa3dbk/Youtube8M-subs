00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
here the center of the hub isn't where

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.640 
here the center of the hub isn't where
it<00:01:35.640> it<00:01:36.060> mounts<00:01:36.479> in<00:01:36.630> the<00:01:36.659> frame<00:01:36.990> itself<00:01:37.320> set

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
it it mounts in the frame itself set

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.140 
it it mounts in the frame itself set
this<00:01:37.829> bit<00:01:38.070> is<00:01:38.130> where<00:01:38.280> it<00:01:38.400> drops<00:01:38.640> its<00:01:38.820> and<00:01:39.000> drop
