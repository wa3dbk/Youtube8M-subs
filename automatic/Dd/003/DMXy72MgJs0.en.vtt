00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:07.130
 hello everyone today very short 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.410
 video 

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:14.190
 I'm going to show you how I'm 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:17.310
 stage my carrots and how I reach 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.869
 self-sufficiency so I show you 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.380
 how to know how we do very 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:31.410
 simple very easy and always the same 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:35.670
 autonomy then behind me so I 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:38.010
 allowed to go to seed is of course a 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.190
 two three four and five 5 feet from 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.559
 carrots 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:43.860
 I had already shown them in 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.440
 videos 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:50.760
 so there are good dry monthan change 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:52.770
 of color so there it remains more 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.789
 now only on trial but hey I have 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.789
 prepared a small piece of land 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.240
 watch a lot of units 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:18.130
 we cut a very dry head and 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:18.130
 attention there these difficulties 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:26.520
 and we are not afraid we do not put 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:51.210
 here and the rest we follow him in the 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:53.570
 earth is biodegradable so in a 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.570
 head 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:02.570
 in a head like that we have to see 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:03.710
 equivalent to the two packets and 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:09.520
 still i'm sure i'm 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:11.990
 pessimistic of carrot seeds so 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.250
 a head like this can do your 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:16.540
 consumption for the year of carrots 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:21.200
 widely and as we have plenty 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:25.250
 one foot gave in five six big 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:28.730
 heads like that so that's why 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:32.030
 to deprive oh no but all that pushes it 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:35.030
 push rhin onr piqueras we can even 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:37.450
 take them off everything that drives dad 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.450
 why not 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.760
 what can you say 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:15.090
 and besides you are cute, do not know if we 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:16.830
 see on the cameras is that it's raining 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:23.700
 so I do not like to need a 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:24.920
 pink but everywhere and today it's 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.150
 everything is good 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:30.060
 so once we have this dish 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:32.970
 what plan to speech input anything 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:38.310
 always watered less than three 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:40.950
 evenings behind that since the storm 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:45.560
 does not have the weather is not super lenient with 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:45.560
 So here it is to place top 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:04:01.120
 So that's the easiest method the 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:01.120
 world we go to the shelter 

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:05.480
 that's because it's starting to see itself 

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:06.709
 still strong enough for that's the 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:09.349
 the simplest method in the world for 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:10.819
 transplanting carrots and there you are 

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:15.799
 completely autonomous you have to 

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:18.109
 abundance a few heads do is put 

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:20.359
 also inside I will keep and 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:22.150
 will persist even more the one that me 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:26.979
 but a big data to friends 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:28.130
 So here we are with 5 carrots 

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:30.710
 grow 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:33.410
 so of course are not carrots type 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:35.169
 f1 we can not picket each 

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:37.260
 point it's good carrots 

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:40.710
 that is to say 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:42.240
 we can reuse each time so there 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:43.800
 I planted my carrots for the year 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:46.860
 next and I also won in a 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:49.110
 other end of garden etc story time 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:49.560
 to plenty you have to be 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:52.980
 pleasure 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:56.280
 and so here are some little videos 

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:58.890
 short videos do not say much about them 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:59.700
 urge to do the same keep your seeds 

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:01.140
 from one year to another 

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:03.150
 always the same I was I say 

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:05.430
 often 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:08.520
 we need our seeds to get used 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:11.160
 to get used to gardeners and that 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:11.820
 here we are autonomous in seed of 

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:15.210
 plus it'll go 

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:17.850
 and bigger industries is worth 

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:21.750
 create seeds for can not 

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:23.880
 do in the garden but at home so soon 

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:28.220
 now makes beautiful seed stock 

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:31.950
 teach your seeds to react as you 

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:34.350
 like to garden and more years 

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:37.350
 to pass and more are strong and 

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:40.140
 disease-resistant and more beautiful 

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:42.290
 are autonomous and more important thanks to 

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:42.290
 all
