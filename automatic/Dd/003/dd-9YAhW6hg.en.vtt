say<00:02:27.560> if<00:02:28.040> I<00:02:28.130> was<00:02:28.280> honest<00:02:28.580> I<00:02:29.000> was<00:02:29.570> a<00:02:29.600> bit

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
say if I was honest I was a bit

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.230 
say if I was honest I was a bit
depressed<00:02:30.080> at<00:02:30.230> the<00:02:30.260> time<00:02:30.530> and<00:02:30.800> I<00:02:31.240> suffered

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:32.240 
depressed at the time and I suffered

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:34.930 
depressed at the time and I suffered
from<00:02:32.390> a<00:02:32.540> light<00:02:33.320> depression<00:02:33.890> but<00:02:34.640> I<00:02:34.670> think

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 
from a light depression but I think

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:38.890 
from a light depression but I think
since<00:02:35.690> then<00:02:35.960> I've<00:02:36.230> put<00:02:37.100> myself<00:02:37.220> all<00:02:37.900> started

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
since then I've put myself all started

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:39.670 
since then I've put myself all started
changing

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
changing

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.400 
changing
my<00:02:40.340> way<00:02:40.490> of<00:02:40.610> thinking<00:02:41.090> and<00:02:41.270> I've<00:02:41.960> lost<00:02:42.110> a<00:02:42.260> lot

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 
my way of thinking and I've lost a lot

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:44.740 
my way of thinking and I've lost a lot
of<00:02:42.470> weight<00:02:42.680> on<00:02:43.280> the<00:02:44.000> right<00:02:44.150> path<00:02:44.450> and

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
of weight on the right path and

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.560 
of weight on the right path and
hopefully<00:02:45.580> next<00:02:46.580> it'd<00:02:46.820> be<00:02:46.910> a<00:02:46.940> big<00:02:47.120> season<00:02:47.270> for

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:47.570 
hopefully next it'd be a big season for

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:48.850 
hopefully next it'd be a big season for
me<00:02:47.690> you<00:02:47.990> know<00:02:48.080> when<00:02:48.230> when<00:02:48.590> do<00:02:48.680> you<00:02:48.770> think

00:04:29.779 --> 00:04:29.789 
best moment at the pub probably

00:04:29.789 --> 00:04:33.659 
best moment at the pub probably
there<00:04:30.789> be<00:04:30.879> a<00:04:30.909> couple<00:04:31.330> I<00:04:31.479> think<00:04:32.279> the<00:04:33.279> war<00:04:33.519> must

00:04:33.659 --> 00:04:33.669 
there be a couple I think the war must

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:35.100 
there be a couple I think the war must
stand<00:04:33.879> out<00:04:34.029> for<00:04:34.149> me<00:04:34.239> obviously<00:04:34.629> is<00:04:34.779> scoring

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:35.110 
stand out for me obviously is scoring

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:37.469 
stand out for me obviously is scoring
five<00:04:35.319> minutes<00:04:35.619> after<00:04:36.009> I<00:04:36.249> think<00:04:37.059> that<00:04:37.179> that<00:04:37.389> was

00:04:37.469 --> 00:04:37.479 
five minutes after I think that that was

00:04:37.479 --> 00:04:41.159 
five minutes after I think that that was
a<00:04:37.539> big<00:04:37.689> moment<00:04:37.899> for<00:04:38.080> me<00:04:38.289> I<00:04:38.619> think<00:04:40.050> when<00:04:41.050> I<00:04:41.080> came

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:41.169 
a big moment for me I think when I came

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:46.199 
a big moment for me I think when I came
on<00:04:41.499> again<00:04:41.879> stop<00:04:42.879> or<00:04:43.679> after<00:04:44.759> I'd<00:04:45.759> been<00:04:45.789> out<00:04:46.029> for

00:04:46.199 --> 00:04:46.209 
on again stop or after I'd been out for

00:04:46.209 --> 00:04:50.040 
on again stop or after I'd been out for
a<00:04:46.269> while<00:04:47.249> really<00:04:48.249> like<00:04:48.369> we<00:04:48.580> lost<00:04:49.389> he<00:04:49.719> won<00:04:49.929> at

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:50.050 
a while really like we lost he won at

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:51.929 
a while really like we lost he won at
home<00:04:50.129> but<00:04:51.129> the<00:04:51.219> fun's<00:04:51.429> gonna<00:04:51.639> be<00:04:51.729> a<00:04:51.759> really

00:04:51.929 --> 00:04:51.939 
home but the fun's gonna be a really

00:04:51.939 --> 00:04:53.219 
home but the fun's gonna be a really
good<00:04:52.179> reception<00:04:52.419> when<00:04:52.689> I<00:04:52.749> finally<00:04:52.929> came<00:04:53.199> back

00:04:53.219 --> 00:04:53.229 
good reception when I finally came back

00:04:53.229 --> 00:04:55.589 
good reception when I finally came back
but<00:04:54.189> I'd<00:04:54.249> say<00:04:54.429> that<00:04:54.580> probably<00:04:54.849> the<00:04:54.969> standout

00:04:55.589 --> 00:04:55.599 
but I'd say that probably the standout

00:04:55.599 --> 00:04:57.959 
but I'd say that probably the standout
was<00:04:55.929> my<00:04:56.559> first<00:04:56.800> game<00:04:56.979> back<00:04:57.159> for<00:04:57.429> my<00:04:57.550> Achilles

injury against Cambridge and then the

00:05:01.689 --> 00:05:03.559 
injury against Cambridge and then the
funds<00:05:01.899> got<00:05:02.110> me<00:05:02.229> stunned<00:05:02.409> innovation<00:05:03.039> and
