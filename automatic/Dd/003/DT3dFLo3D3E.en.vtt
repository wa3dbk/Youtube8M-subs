go on quite the same as the other head
gear<00:00:56.190> it<00:00:56.399> slips<00:00:56.670> on<00:00:56.850> more<00:00:57.059> like<00:00:57.210> a<00:00:57.239> hat<00:00:57.539> you

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
gear it slips on more like a hat you

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.510 
gear it slips on more like a hat you
start<00:00:58.109> it<00:00:58.230> this<00:00:58.350> way<00:00:58.559> with<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:58.829> chin<00:00:59.070> cap<00:00:59.280> up

start it this way with the chin cap up

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.229 
start it this way with the chin cap up
slip<00:01:00.210> it<00:01:00.359> onto<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:00.690> head<00:01:00.930> bring<00:01:01.739> it<00:01:01.859> down<00:01:02.239> so

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
slip it onto the head bring it down so

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.000 
slip it onto the head bring it down so
that<00:01:03.270> it's<00:01:03.600> going<00:01:03.930> past<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:04.470> nose<00:01:04.619> and<00:01:04.830> under

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
that it's going past the nose and under

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:05.870 
that it's going past the nose and under
the<00:01:05.100> chin<00:01:05.250> go<00:01:05.430> ahead<00:01:05.549> and<00:01:05.640> float<00:01:05.790> it<00:01:05.850> down

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
the chin go ahead and float it down

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.940 
the chin go ahead and float it down
thereby<00:01:06.330> we're<00:01:06.720> gonna<00:01:06.869> pull<00:01:07.080> this<00:01:07.229> down<00:01:07.470> we

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
thereby we're gonna pull this down we

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.950 
thereby we're gonna pull this down we
only<00:01:08.100> have<00:01:08.220> to<00:01:08.340> do<00:01:08.430> this<00:01:08.549> one<00:01:08.790> time<00:01:08.820> and<00:01:09.450> notice

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
only have to do this one time and notice

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.570 
only have to do this one time and notice
it's<00:01:10.170> dropping<00:01:10.650> down<00:01:10.830> so<00:01:11.189> that<00:01:11.310> I'm<00:01:11.430> gonna

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
it's dropping down so that I'm gonna

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.100 
it's dropping down so that I'm gonna
give<00:01:11.760> it<00:01:11.880> under<00:01:12.090> these<00:01:12.180> lobes<00:01:12.540> on<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:12.930> back

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
give it under these lobes on the back

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.999 
give it under these lobes on the back
okay<00:01:14.010> then<00:01:14.909> once<00:01:15.420> that's<00:01:15.659> done<00:01:15.840> then<00:01:16.680> we<00:01:16.770> turn

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
okay then once that's done then we turn

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.140 
okay then once that's done then we turn
this<00:01:17.130> thing<00:01:17.189> and<00:01:17.430> it's<00:01:17.520> got<00:01:17.640> one<00:01:17.670> loop<00:01:18.119> here

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
this thing and it's got one loop here

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.240 
this thing and it's got one loop here
and<00:01:18.420> we<00:01:18.570> start<00:01:18.900> pulling<00:01:19.200> this<00:01:19.290> loop<00:01:19.619> notice

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
and we start pulling this loop notice

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.039 
and we start pulling this loop notice
this<00:01:20.400> loop<00:01:20.580> is<00:01:20.729> hooking<00:01:21.150> under<00:01:21.479> this<00:01:21.600> temporal

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
this loop is hooking under this temporal

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.080 
this loop is hooking under this temporal
lobe<00:01:22.229> welcome<00:01:22.650> into<00:01:22.890> that<00:01:22.979> temporal<00:01:23.400> lobe<00:01:23.580> and

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
lobe welcome into that temporal lobe and

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.270 
lobe welcome into that temporal lobe and
there's<00:01:24.210> one<00:01:24.420> on<00:01:24.570> the<00:01:24.689> ears<00:01:24.930> right<00:01:25.860> here<00:01:26.130> it's

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
there's one on the ears right here it's

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.300 
there's one on the ears right here it's
gonna<00:01:26.400> hold<00:01:26.580> it<00:01:26.790> back<00:01:26.970> and<00:01:27.270> as<00:01:27.570> I<00:01:27.689> pull<00:01:27.990> it<00:01:28.310> now

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
gonna hold it back and as I pull it now

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:30.620 
gonna hold it back and as I pull it now
I<00:01:29.340> can<00:01:29.610> I<00:01:29.820> can<00:01:29.970> probably<00:01:30.150> squeeze<00:01:30.420> these

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
I can I can probably squeeze these

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.270 
I can I can probably squeeze these
brains<00:01:30.960> out<00:01:31.259> here<00:01:31.500> but<00:01:31.650> I'm<00:01:31.740> not<00:01:31.770> going<00:01:32.070> to<00:01:32.130> do

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
brains out here but I'm not going to do

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.969 
brains out here but I'm not going to do
it<00:01:32.840> that's<00:01:33.840> pretty<00:01:33.960> tight<00:01:34.259> tight<00:01:34.740> on<00:01:34.890> the

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
it that's pretty tight tight on the
