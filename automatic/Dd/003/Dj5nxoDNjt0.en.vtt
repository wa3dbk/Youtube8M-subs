00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.870
 how to mother passion 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:16.400
 ok, yes, we prayed right 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:23.720
 what I read say this way 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:28.640
 we need our prayers for anyone 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:32.399
 for the living for the dead for all his mouth 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:38.390
 only then will be effective 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:41.399
 and accepted by God when we ourselves begin 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:45.469
 at least a little fight with their 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:48.450
 passions when am I only language 

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:51.930
 I remember they commemorated there let's say 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:54.260
 deceased or giving notes but not myself 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.620
 pray then prayers turn out 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.469
 inactive 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.500
 the saint writes very well about this 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:04.110
 Theophan the Recluse 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:06.600
 inactive and the end of prayer can our 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.540
 only when we first pray 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:13.049
 with attention awe in contrition 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:16.080
 hearts and secondly itâ€™s very important though 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:19.259
 but we try to keep the right one 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:22.380
 Christian life like degree 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:26.880
 our spiritual cleansing to my soul 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:28.110
 degree passes the light of God on those beyond 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.100
 whom we pray 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:35.610
 when do we keep our soul black 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:39.540
 here look at the window glass 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:42.030
 the light will not break god this sun 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:47.189
 illuminating and our prayers what does 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:49.049
 gives way for God's light which 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:52.520
 can only heal and help our 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:57.119
 deceased by this window glass 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:02:00.030
 is our soul therefore paid 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:03.869
 I teach attention to the saints 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:06.439
 pray why their prayers then 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:11.430
 effective understand why 

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:13.170
 cleaned this glass and then their prayers 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:16.730
 that is, here they are turning 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:20.370
 God's light then passes and if we 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:23.730
 we will be completely neglected 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:26.489
 the condition of his soul neglect nothing 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:29.190
 We live like pagans perform purely 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:32.160
 externally and ecclesiastical only rules and not 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:34.920
 we will fight our passions 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:37.470
 the glass of the soul remains forever the same 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:41.160
 black and then our prayers 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:43.910
 will be without effect so we will 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:48.150
 try to live like a Christian 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:51.360
 confession and communion to perform 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:53.790
 the commandments repent violations and then our 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:57.350
 prayers will be effective 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:57.350
 only under this condition
