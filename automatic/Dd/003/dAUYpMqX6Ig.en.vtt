00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.160
 hello guys welcome to a new video 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.589
 of watercolor for beginners 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:10.349
 in this episode we will see how to do it 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:12.000
 abstract exercises to learn a 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.690
 handle wet on wet e 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.690
 wrong on dry 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.930
 the necessary materials are as always 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.490
 scotch paper card and tablet 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.580
 watercolors in this case I will use 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:29.699
 those of the lidl is a container like 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:33.140
 a dish water compartments and brushes for 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.140
 watercolor then round tip brushes 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:40.379
 so let's see how to do it as before 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.780
 what do you prepare your colors in 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.300
 flat with compartments for each compartment 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.620
 so a color I use colors 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.300
 mostly bright colors 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.720
 of the rainbow but you can use 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.640
 all the colors you like the most and 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:55.949
 so then go and dissolve the colors 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.079
 with water a lot of beginners 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.059
 among you they ask me how to do a 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.710
 manage the relationship between water and color 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.739
 well for this exercise you don't owe yourself 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:08.060
 Worrying about this in any case is a 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.060
 something that comes with experience 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.159
 and now let's start the exercise as before 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:21.009
 what you need to go about creating circles 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:22.780
 on your sheet using water if 

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:24.759
 you feel more confident you can do it 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:26.439
 however, drawing them with a pencil I will 

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:28.240
 I recommend to be very free for 

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:29.950
 this exercise which is abstract and not 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.960
 must be absolutely precise and of 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:33.610
 go and draw your circles 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:36.219
 simply with a wet brush 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:37.719
 of water 

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:40.840
 at this point take the colors and 

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:42.759
 start coloring your circles 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.000
 performing a wet on wet 

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:48.490
 this exercise has the purpose 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.630
 absolutely get rid of any 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:51.849
 concern towards 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:54.159
 of the watercolor you have to take it 

00:01:51.849 --> 00:01:56.140
 really like a liberation not 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:58.869
 think too much about the colors you want 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:00.670
 use do not reflect do not use the 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:04.000
 rationality but simply pure 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:06.189
 instinct then continue to color 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.789
 all your circles with colors 

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:08.789
 which you like the most 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:17.150
 the purpose of this exercise is to 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:19.040
 learn to manage color on 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.260
 wet backing so understand how 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:24.650
 color interacts with paper 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:27.200
 wet for example by blending it towards the 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:30.160
 blank sheet and how i interact 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.160
 colors between them 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:37.600
 you also find to give effects like 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:39.130
 for example, spray clean water with 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:41.640
 a spray or use the walsh 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:41.640
 white 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:50.770
 repeat this circle thing with 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:52.300
 wet on wet until not 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:54.610
 you feel satisfied you can fill up 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:57.400
 also sheets and sheets with these exercises 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:58.690
 stretches worried, not judging 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.850
 while you do it but simply 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:04.420
 experiment then tilt the sheet 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:07.020
 move the color experiment play 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:07.020
 with color 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.580
 another really useful exercise 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:19.580
 consists of drawing strips 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:22.010
 more or less thick lines always 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:23.390
 using different colors to see 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:26.180
 how they interact with each other 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:27.290
 you can do it both on the wet surface and 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:29.780
 on the dry surface 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:31.400
 this exercise will serve just beyond 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:34.489
 that to understand how i interact 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:38.360
 colors also to acquire more manual skills 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:41.000
 and better manage the brush precisely 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:43.459
 tracing straight lines that they are 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.260
 certainly difficult to trace a 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:48.700
 free hand then a great exercise 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.700
 of dexterity 

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:55.099
 also for this exercise guys 

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:57.319
 remember that we are not trying to 

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:59.180
 just make a masterpiece we are 

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:01.040
 trying to figure out how to take advantage of this 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:03.049
 and a half at its best 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:06.230
 potential then free your mind e 

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:08.780
 be creative and obviously not 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:15.200
 judge v but perform the exercise in 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:16.519
 total ease and freedom another 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:18.530
 very useful exercise to acquire 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:20.810
 greater dexterity and greater control 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:22.610
 of the medium always consists in tracing 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:25.400
 some lines, however, a little thinner than the 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:29.120
 precedents in three colors only in three 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:30.740
 alternating colors between these lines 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:33.970
 they must be traced in a manner 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:33.970
 safe and decisive 

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:44.380
 and after that dry at once 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:47.520
 dry repeating this 

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:50.050
 time the new strips with strips 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:52.630
 previous and then see how 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:54.790
 the color interacts once dry 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:57.540
 with the underlying color then as yes 

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:57.540
 they do the glazes 

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:03.910
 well guys the exercise is over 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:05.720
 I hope I gave you some ideas 

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:07.300
 interesting to start with 

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:10.130
 start practicing with watercolor 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:11.150
