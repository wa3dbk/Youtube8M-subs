00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:44.440 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:46.710 

so<00:04:44.980> I'm<00:04:45.100> not<00:04:45.220> sure<00:04:45.280> if<00:04:45.550> I<00:04:45.700> pick<00:04:46.120> the<00:04:46.300> right<00:04:46.450> car

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:46.720 
so I'm not sure if I pick the right car

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:49.590 
so I'm not sure if I pick the right car
for<00:04:46.750> this<00:04:46.990> but<00:04:47.170> you<00:04:47.260> go<00:04:47.380> to<00:04:47.470> lobby<00:04:48.390> but<00:04:49.390> like<00:04:49.510> I

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:49.600 
for this but you go to lobby but like I

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:50.940 
for this but you go to lobby but like I
said<00:04:49.660> I<00:04:49.810> just<00:04:49.840> wanted<00:04:50.170> to<00:04:50.200> show<00:04:50.380> off<00:04:50.410> the<00:04:50.680> skin

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:50.950 
said I just wanted to show off the skin

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:56.220 
said I just wanted to show off the skin
a<00:04:50.980> little<00:04:51.160> bit<00:04:53.430> and<00:04:54.450> we're<00:04:55.450> just<00:04:56.140> about

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:56.230 
a little bit and we're just about

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:57.810 
a little bit and we're just about
finishing<00:04:56.620> up<00:04:56.740> the<00:04:56.830> third<00:04:57.010> lap<00:04:57.250> but<00:04:57.400> I<00:04:57.490> think

00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:57.820 
finishing up the third lap but I think

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:59.580 
finishing up the third lap but I think
there's<00:04:58.150> a<00:04:58.210> guy<00:04:58.420> catching<00:04:58.990> me<00:04:59.110> pretty<00:04:59.410> good

00:04:59.580 --> 00:04:59.590 
there's a guy catching me pretty good

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:02.280 
there's a guy catching me pretty good
here<00:05:00.300> there<00:05:01.300> may<00:05:01.420> be<00:05:01.450> someone<00:05:01.780> that<00:05:01.870> started

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:02.290 
here there may be someone that started

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:03.450 
here there may be someone that started
back<00:05:02.410> in<00:05:02.470> the<00:05:02.620> pack<00:05:02.860> that's<00:05:03.010> a<00:05:03.130> little<00:05:03.370> bit

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:03.460 
back in the pack that's a little bit

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:06.060 
back in the pack that's a little bit
faster<00:05:03.610> than<00:05:04.000> I<00:05:04.090> am<00:05:04.740> so<00:05:05.740> I<00:05:05.800> need<00:05:06.010> to

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:06.070 
faster than I am so I need to

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:07.410 
faster than I am so I need to
concentrate<00:05:06.220> on<00:05:06.640> driving<00:05:06.910> a<00:05:07.120> little<00:05:07.240> bit

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:07.420 
concentrate on driving a little bit

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:09.120 
concentrate on driving a little bit
better<00:05:07.570> there's<00:05:08.290> two<00:05:08.470> cars<00:05:08.710> catching<00:05:09.040> me

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:09.130 
better there's two cars catching me

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:18.740 
better there's two cars catching me
actually<00:05:11.100> yeah<00:05:12.100> they're<00:05:12.550> not<00:05:12.700> too<00:05:12.850> far<00:05:13.060> back

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:18.750 

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:20.300 

see<00:05:19.290> if<00:05:19.350> I<00:05:19.410> can<00:05:19.560> make<00:05:19.590> it<00:05:19.800> through<00:05:19.890> the<00:05:20.010> city

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:20.310 
see if I can make it through the city

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:23.090 
see if I can make it through the city
real<00:05:20.520> quick<00:05:20.550> I<00:05:21.170> actually<00:05:22.170> have<00:05:22.440> a<00:05:22.470> grace<00:05:22.770> c

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:23.100 
real quick I actually have a grace c

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:25.490 
real quick I actually have a grace c
class<00:05:23.340> for<00:05:23.640> quite<00:05:23.760> a<00:05:23.880> while<00:05:24.410> so<00:05:25.410> I<00:05:25.440> haven't

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:25.500 
class for quite a while so I haven't

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:29.420 
class for quite a while so I haven't
revisited<00:05:25.890> my<00:05:26.400> car<00:05:26.700> I<00:05:26.910> haven't<00:05:28.070> applied<00:05:29.070> all

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:29.430 
revisited my car I haven't applied all

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:30.980 
revisited my car I haven't applied all
the<00:05:29.550> things<00:05:29.760> that<00:05:29.910> I've<00:05:30.000> learned<00:05:30.030> from<00:05:30.510> tuning

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:30.990 
the things that I've learned from tuning

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:34.640 
the things that I've learned from tuning
up<00:05:31.410> in<00:05:31.770> the<00:05:31.860> higher<00:05:31.980> classes<00:05:32.220> back<00:05:32.820> down<00:05:33.410> we<00:05:34.410> do

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:34.650 
up in the higher classes back down we do

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:46.300 
up in the higher classes back down we do
that<00:05:34.830> I<00:05:35.780> think<00:05:36.780> these<00:05:36.870> cars<00:05:37.140> even<00:05:37.350> better

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:46.310 

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:50.580 

just<00:05:47.150> a<00:05:47.450> little<00:05:47.660> ways<00:05:47.870> back<00:05:48.110> there

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:50.590 

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:53.370 

should<00:05:51.460> be<00:05:51.760> off<00:05:52.480> although<00:05:52.750> I<00:05:52.840> mean<00:05:53.110> that's<00:05:53.230> a

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:53.380 
should be off although I mean that's a

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:59.180 
should be off although I mean that's a
whole<00:05:53.560> labs<00:05:54.540> anything<00:05:55.540> can<00:05:55.660> happen

00:05:59.180 --> 00:05:59.190 

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:09.970 

making<00:05:59.580> this<00:05:59.700> right<00:05:59.940> here

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:09.980 

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:11.950 

the<00:06:10.910> other<00:06:11.030> thing<00:06:11.150> to<00:06:11.270> be<00:06:11.360> really<00:06:11.600> cool<00:06:11.750> if<00:06:11.810> you

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:11.960 
the other thing to be really cool if you

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:13.150 
the other thing to be really cool if you
guys<00:06:12.050> could<00:06:12.290> hop<00:06:12.470> into<00:06:12.740> some<00:06:12.980> of<00:06:13.070> these

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:13.160 
guys could hop into some of these

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:16.300 
guys could hop into some of these
hoppers<00:06:13.550> when<00:06:13.790> i'm<00:06:13.880> racing<00:06:14.060> is<00:06:14.860> the<00:06:15.860> guys<00:06:16.130> that

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:16.310 
hoppers when i'm racing is the guys that

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:18.220 
hoppers when i'm racing is the guys that
I<00:06:16.430> do<00:06:16.490> race<00:06:16.790> with<00:06:17.060> when<00:06:17.360> I<00:06:17.600> do<00:06:17.660> a<00:06:17.780> race<00:06:17.990> with

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:18.230 
I do race with when I do a race with

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:20.740 
I do race with when I do a race with
wrought<00:06:18.410> series<00:06:18.860> they're<00:06:19.790> pretty<00:06:20.660> good

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:20.750 
wrought series they're pretty good

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:24.999 
wrought series they're pretty good
drivers<00:06:21.170> as<00:06:21.290> well

00:06:24.999 --> 00:06:25.009 

00:06:25.009 --> 00:06:26.679 

so<00:06:25.550> you<00:06:25.639> might<00:06:25.789> see<00:06:26.029> a<00:06:26.059> little<00:06:26.150> bit<00:06:26.419> more

00:06:26.679 --> 00:06:26.689 
so you might see a little bit more

00:06:26.689 --> 00:06:29.399 
so you might see a little bit more
strong<00:06:27.680> competition<00:06:28.219> right<00:06:28.580> now<00:06:28.610> I'm<00:06:28.909> kind<00:06:29.180> of

00:06:29.399 --> 00:06:29.409 
strong competition right now I'm kind of

00:06:29.409 --> 00:06:31.600 
strong competition right now I'm kind of
kind<00:06:30.409> of<00:06:30.529> walking<00:06:30.710> away<00:06:30.949> with<00:06:31.219> this<00:06:31.339> and<00:06:31.550> I

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:31.610 
kind of walking away with this and I

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:35.769 
kind of walking away with this and I
think<00:06:31.669> I'm<00:06:31.909> pretty<00:06:32.330> safe<00:06:34.059> as<00:06:35.059> i<00:06:35.240> do<00:06:35.300> something

00:06:35.769 --> 00:06:35.779 
think I'm pretty safe as i do something

00:06:35.779 --> 00:06:48.800 
think I'm pretty safe as i do something
really<00:06:35.930> really<00:06:37.360> silly

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:48.810 

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:50.600 

yeah<00:06:49.350> I<00:06:49.470> just<00:06:49.590> pretty<00:06:49.889> much<00:06:49.950> need<00:06:50.190> to<00:06:50.250> be<00:06:50.370> safe

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:50.610 
yeah I just pretty much need to be safe

00:06:50.610 --> 00:07:03.590 
yeah I just pretty much need to be safe
here<00:06:50.880> the<00:06:51.000> rest<00:06:51.150> of<00:06:51.300> the<00:06:52.490> risk<00:06:53.490> the<00:06:53.639> race

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:03.600 

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:07.300 

but<00:07:04.170> a<00:07:04.200> pretty<00:07:04.470> decent<00:07:04.740> lap<00:07:04.860> time<00:07:05.100> down<00:07:05.310> ago

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:07.310 
but a pretty decent lap time down ago

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:09.440 
but a pretty decent lap time down ago
see<00:07:08.310> what<00:07:08.430> happens<00:07:08.730> when<00:07:08.760> you<00:07:08.910> don't<00:07:09.060> talk<00:07:09.210> so

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:09.450 
see what happens when you don't talk so

like<00:07:35.610> there<00:07:35.880> was<00:07:36.030> a<00:07:36.740> Honda<00:07:37.740> Civic<00:07:37.770> that<00:07:38.220> was

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:38.310 
like there was a Honda Civic that was

00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:41.840 
like there was a Honda Civic that was
faster<00:07:38.759> than<00:07:38.789> I<00:07:39.030> was<00:07:40.190> although<00:07:41.190> his<00:07:41.340> lap<00:07:41.669> was

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:41.850 
faster than I was although his lap was
