00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
this is the warranty card I guess for

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.790

winners that we need for charging same

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:56.060 
winners that we need for charging same
thing<00:03:52.350> with<00:03:52.560> pcs<00:03:53.540> first<00:03:54.540> is<00:03:54.930> yet<00:03:55.230> this<00:03:55.769> is<00:03:55.950> the

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:56.070 
thing with pcs first is yet this is the

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:58.640 
thing with pcs first is yet this is the
wall<00:03:56.280> charger<00:03:56.880> the<00:03:57.600> other<00:03:57.750> end<00:03:58.019> is<00:03:58.140> yellow<00:03:58.530> so

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
wall charger the other end is yellow so

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:01.280 
wall charger the other end is yellow so
that<00:03:58.800> you<00:03:58.950> want<00:03:59.130> mistaken<00:03:59.900> to<00:04:00.900> be<00:04:01.019> the<00:04:01.170> other

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
that you want mistaken to be the other

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:04.210 
that you want mistaken to be the other
one<00:04:01.530> I<00:04:01.760> think<00:04:02.760> this<00:04:03.000> would<00:04:03.180> be<00:04:03.300> different<00:04:03.480> from

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:04.220 
one I think this would be different from

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:06.650 
one I think this would be different from
slightly<00:04:05.220> larger<00:04:05.640> I<00:04:05.670> guess<00:04:06.000> from<00:04:06.300> the<00:04:06.390> one

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:06.660 
slightly larger I guess from the one

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:07.940 
slightly larger I guess from the one
that<00:04:06.780> you<00:04:06.870> will<00:04:06.989> be<00:04:07.019> using<00:04:07.140> for<00:04:07.410> your<00:04:07.650> black

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:07.950 
that you will be using for your black

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:09.010 
that you will be using for your black
boots

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:09.020 
boots

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:12.370 
boots
and<00:04:09.280> then<00:04:10.280> this<00:04:10.460> one<00:04:10.790> is<00:04:10.820> the<00:04:11.270> USB<00:04:11.690> cable<00:04:12.080> for

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:12.380 
and then this one is the USB cable for

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:18.850 
and then this one is the USB cable for
sinking<00:04:12.890> and<00:04:15.190> the<00:04:16.780> adapter<00:04:17.780> for<00:04:18.110> the<00:04:18.170> wall

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:18.860 
sinking and the adapter for the wall

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:22.030 
sinking and the adapter for the wall
charger<00:04:20.260> another<00:04:21.260> one<00:04:21.440> I<00:04:21.470> think<00:04:21.560> is<00:04:21.739> for<00:04:21.950> the

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:22.040 
charger another one I think is for the

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:24.160 
charger another one I think is for the
Asian<00:04:22.190> version<00:04:22.610> this<00:04:22.940> is<00:04:23.000> for<00:04:23.360> the<00:04:23.390> UK<00:04:23.750> version
