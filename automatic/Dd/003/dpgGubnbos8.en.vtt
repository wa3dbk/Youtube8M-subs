imagine what environment these drums

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:55.750 
imagine what environment these drums
might<00:03:52.970> exelon<00:03:53.720> life<00:03:53.930> like<00:03:54.470> in<00:03:54.739> a<00:03:55.220> live<00:03:55.489> setting

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:55.760 
might exelon life like in a live setting

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:58.719 
might exelon life like in a live setting
what<00:03:56.569> would<00:03:56.780> be<00:03:56.989> a<00:03:57.019> more<00:03:57.470> preferable<00:03:58.159> set<00:03:58.459> in<00:03:58.699> a

00:03:58.719 --> 00:03:58.729 
what would be a more preferable set in a

00:03:58.729 --> 00:04:02.259 
what would be a more preferable set in a
recording<00:03:59.389> setting<00:03:59.780> after<00:04:00.590> this<00:04:01.269> experiment

00:04:02.259 --> 00:04:02.269 
recording setting after this experiment

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:06.039 
recording setting after this experiment
I<00:04:02.449> conclude<00:04:03.379> for<00:04:04.069> me<00:04:04.250> I<00:04:04.489> love<00:04:05.150> the<00:04:05.389> warmth<00:04:05.900> and

it's the hardware it's very well in

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:41.530 
it's the hardware it's very well in
jamia<00:04:38.510> well<00:04:38.870> engineered<00:04:39.560> and<00:04:39.889> sturdy<00:04:40.639> strong

jamia well engineered and sturdy strong

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:44.320 
jamia well engineered and sturdy strong
sturdy<00:04:42.110> and<00:04:42.350> about<00:04:42.740> the<00:04:42.919> sound<00:04:43.160> I<00:04:43.460> don't<00:04:44.150> want

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:44.330 
sturdy and about the sound I don't want

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:46.780 
sturdy and about the sound I don't want
to<00:04:44.450> give<00:04:44.630> the<00:04:44.990> sound<00:04:45.650> engineer<00:04:45.919> a<00:04:46.220> hard<00:04:46.550> time

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:46.790 
to give the sound engineer a hard time

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:51.760 
to give the sound engineer a hard time
mixing<00:04:47.660> my<00:04:48.080> sound<00:04:48.380> on<00:04:49.310> stage<00:04:49.730> so<00:04:50.720> I<00:04:51.260> guess<00:04:51.530> I'll

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:51.770 
mixing my sound on stage so I guess I'll

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:55.300 
mixing my sound on stage so I guess I'll
take<00:04:52.160> a<00:04:52.190> reference<00:04:53.000> for<00:04:53.780> live<00:04:54.320> situations<00:04:55.010> and

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:55.310 
take a reference for live situations and

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:57.850 
take a reference for live situations and
actually<00:04:56.030> i<00:04:56.060> read<00:04:56.600> about<00:04:56.630> tons<00:04:57.229> of<00:04:57.410> artists

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:12.290 
okay and i think when we listen to the

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:14.230 
okay and i think when we listen to the
gretsch<00:05:12.620> inside<00:05:13.040> the<00:05:13.220> room<00:05:13.400> it's<00:05:13.729> ok<00:05:14.060> it's

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:14.240 
gretsch inside the room it's ok it's

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:16.300 
gretsch inside the room it's ok it's
normal<00:05:14.690> sounding<00:05:15.200> right<00:05:15.500> it's<00:05:15.800> yeah<00:05:16.100> yeah

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:16.310 
normal sounding right it's yeah yeah

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:18.520 
normal sounding right it's yeah yeah
it's<00:05:16.460> nothing<00:05:16.760> special<00:05:17.060> but<00:05:17.270> we<00:05:17.930> listen<00:05:18.410> to

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:18.530 
it's nothing special but we listen to

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:21.040 
it's nothing special but we listen to
the<00:05:18.560> reference<00:05:19.070> kit<00:05:19.400> it<00:05:19.580> sounds<00:05:19.970> so<00:05:20.120> punchy<00:05:20.960> in

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:21.050 
the reference kit it sounds so punchy in

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:24.100 
the reference kit it sounds so punchy in
the<00:05:21.169> room<00:05:21.380> but<00:05:21.710> when<00:05:22.430> we<00:05:22.610> recorded<00:05:23.150> it<00:05:23.300> that's

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:24.110 
the room but when we recorded it that's
