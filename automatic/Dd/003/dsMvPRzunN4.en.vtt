tried to use this reel you remember that
there<00:00:29.310> was<00:00:29.400> a<00:00:29.460> problem<00:00:29.820> that<00:00:30.060> sometimes<00:00:30.840> it

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
there was a problem that sometimes it

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.069 
there was a problem that sometimes it
just<00:00:31.500> couldn't<00:00:31.949> retrieve<00:00:32.460> the<00:00:32.700> line<00:00:32.880> and<00:00:33.329> both

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079

uncle Steve and Eric and I looked it

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.060 
uncle Steve and Eric and I looked it
over<00:00:36.780> looked<00:00:37.170> it<00:00:37.290> over<00:00:37.380> and<00:00:37.590> looked<00:00:37.829> it<00:00:37.950> over

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
over looked it over and looked it over

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.590 
over looked it over and looked it over
and<00:00:38.520> sometimes<00:00:38.969> it<00:00:39.149> would<00:00:39.270> work<00:00:39.390> and

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
and sometimes it would work and

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.330 
and sometimes it would work and
sometimes<00:00:39.840> it<00:00:40.170> wouldn't<00:00:40.410> and<00:00:40.680> we<00:00:41.040> knew<00:00:41.190> that

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
sometimes it wouldn't and we knew that

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.850 
sometimes it wouldn't and we knew that
the<00:00:41.550> pin<00:00:42.059> that<00:00:42.480> you<00:00:42.660> can<00:00:42.840> see<00:00:43.050> there<00:00:43.290> was<00:00:43.559> being

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
the pin that you can see there was being

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.639 
the pin that you can see there was being
cocked<00:00:44.309> properly<00:00:44.969> but<00:00:45.149> for<00:00:45.390> some<00:00:45.629> reason<00:00:46.079> it

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
cocked properly but for some reason it

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.889 
cocked properly but for some reason it
just<00:00:46.680> wasn't<00:00:47.399> grabbing<00:00:47.850> the<00:00:48.180> line<00:00:48.450> and

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
just wasn't grabbing the line and

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.040 
just wasn't grabbing the line and
spooling<00:00:49.770> the<00:00:50.280> finally<00:00:51.000> enter<00:00:51.239> Steve<00:00:51.480> took<00:00:51.989> a

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
spooling the finally enter Steve took a

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.350 
spooling the finally enter Steve took a
look<00:00:52.350> at<00:00:52.530> a<00:00:52.649> schematic<00:00:52.949> of<00:00:53.460> this<00:00:53.879> particular

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
look at a schematic of this particular

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.080 
look at a schematic of this particular
reel<00:00:54.960> and<00:00:55.530> other<00:00:55.890> Steve<00:00:56.190> realized<00:00:56.640> that<00:00:56.879> there

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
reel and other Steve realized that there

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.990 
reel and other Steve realized that there
was<00:00:57.300> a<00:00:57.329> part<00:00:57.840> missing<00:00:58.109> in<00:00:58.440> both<00:00:58.620> he<00:00:58.920> and<00:00:59.190> Eric

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
was a part missing in both he and Eric

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.779 
was a part missing in both he and Eric
had<00:01:00.440> overlooked<00:01:01.440> that<00:01:01.680> and<00:01:01.980> it<00:01:02.370> was<00:01:02.550> that

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
had overlooked that and it was that

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.119 
had overlooked that and it was that
there<00:01:02.969> needed<00:01:03.239> to<00:01:03.270> be<00:01:03.359> a<00:01:03.510> c-clip<00:01:04.199> or<00:01:04.500> an<00:01:04.589> e<00:01:04.799> clip

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
there needed to be a c-clip or an e clip

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.120 
there needed to be a c-clip or an e clip
to<00:01:05.519> hold<00:01:05.549> the<00:01:06.060> spool<00:01:06.439> against<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:07.590> back<00:01:07.799> plate

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
to hold the spool against the back plate

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.950 
to hold the spool against the back plate
now<00:01:08.640> you<00:01:08.729> can<00:01:09.090> see<00:01:09.210> there<00:01:09.390> knuckle<00:01:09.659> Steve

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
now you can see there knuckle Steve

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.520 
now you can see there knuckle Steve
solve<00:01:10.740> that<00:01:11.010> problem<00:01:11.580> by<00:01:12.119> using<00:01:12.180> some<00:01:13.110> wire

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
solve that problem by using some wire

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.070 
solve that problem by using some wire
they<00:01:13.860> wrapped<00:01:14.220> on<00:01:14.460> there<00:01:14.760> and<00:01:14.970> twisted<00:01:15.420> into

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
they wrapped on there and twisted into

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.590 
they wrapped on there and twisted into
the<00:01:16.380> slot<00:01:17.130> can<00:01:17.460> you<00:01:17.580> see<00:01:17.790> the<00:01:17.970> slot<00:01:18.240> that<00:01:18.270> the

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
the slot can you see the slot that the

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.260 
the slot can you see the slot that the
wires<00:01:18.840> in<00:01:19.140> and<00:01:19.380> that<00:01:19.920> holds<00:01:20.490> the<00:01:20.640> reel<00:01:20.880> in

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
wires in and that holds the reel in

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.300 
wires in and that holds the reel in
place<00:01:21.570> that<00:01:21.930> was<00:01:22.140> the<00:01:22.170> solution<00:01:22.439> and<00:01:22.950> it<00:01:23.130> works

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
place that was the solution and it works

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.359 
place that was the solution and it works
fine<00:01:23.670> but<00:01:24.450> uncle<00:01:24.780> Steve<00:01:25.049> thought<00:01:25.740> you<00:01:26.220> know

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
fine but uncle Steve thought you know

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.120 
fine but uncle Steve thought you know
maybe<00:01:27.000> we<00:01:27.180> could<00:01:27.570> restore<00:01:27.840> this<00:01:28.259> to<00:01:28.500> closer<00:01:28.799> to

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
maybe we could restore this to closer to

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.340 
maybe we could restore this to closer to
the<00:01:29.250> way<00:01:29.369> it<00:01:29.490> was<00:01:29.640> originally<00:01:29.820> by<00:01:30.750> getting<00:01:31.170> up

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
the way it was originally by getting up

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.170 
the way it was originally by getting up
clip<00:01:31.710> and<00:01:31.950> here<00:01:32.250> you<00:01:32.400> can<00:01:32.579> see<00:01:32.759> what<00:01:32.909> uncle

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
clip and here you can see what uncle

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.640 
clip and here you can see what uncle
Steve<00:01:33.390> found<00:01:33.659> it<00:01:33.869> one<00:01:34.020> of<00:01:34.140> the<00:01:34.259> big<00:01:34.439> box

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
Steve found it one of the big box

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.560 
Steve found it one of the big box
hardware<00:01:35.040> stores<00:01:35.579> this<00:01:35.909> is<00:01:36.090> what<00:01:36.240> he<00:01:36.329> bought

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
hardware stores this is what he bought

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.200 
hardware stores this is what he bought
was<00:01:36.840> two<00:01:37.049> in<00:01:37.170> a<00:01:37.229> pack<00:01:37.470> and<00:01:37.770> by<00:01:38.130> taking<00:01:38.909> the<00:01:39.030> reel

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
was two in a pack and by taking the reel

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.319 
was two in a pack and by taking the reel
with<00:01:39.540> him<00:01:39.869> and<00:01:40.369> eyeballing<00:01:41.369> it<00:01:41.520> he<00:01:41.880> decided

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
with him and eyeballing it he decided

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.230 
with him and eyeballing it he decided
that<00:01:42.570> it<00:01:42.840> was<00:01:42.990> it<00:01:43.380> was<00:01:43.530> a<00:01:43.560> 5/8<00:01:44.159> inch<00:01:44.310> clip<00:01:44.970> that

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
that it was it was a 5/8 inch clip that

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.300 
that it was it was a 5/8 inch clip that
was<00:01:45.390> needed<00:01:45.600> but<00:01:46.200> when<00:01:46.350> he<00:01:46.439> got<00:01:46.590> it<00:01:46.770> home<00:01:46.979> and

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
was needed but when he got it home and

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.580 
was needed but when he got it home and
tried<00:01:47.790> to<00:01:47.820> put<00:01:48.090> it<00:01:48.210> on<00:01:48.390> he<00:01:48.960> discovered<00:01:49.560> that

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
tried to put it on he discovered that

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.030 
tried to put it on he discovered that
the<00:01:49.829> clip<00:01:50.130> was<00:01:50.369> the<00:01:50.549> right<00:01:50.759> size<00:01:51.470> except<00:01:52.470> one

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
the clip was the right size except one

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.340 
the clip was the right size except one
dimension<00:01:53.610> it's<00:01:53.970> too<00:01:54.180> thick<00:01:54.450> you<00:01:54.990> see<00:01:55.229> it's

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
dimension it's too thick you see it's

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.340 
dimension it's too thick you see it's
supposed<00:01:55.710> to<00:01:55.979> slide<00:01:56.670> into<00:01:56.969> that<00:01:57.270> slot<00:01:57.990> there

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
supposed to slide into that slot there

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.830 
supposed to slide into that slot there
on<00:01:58.619> the<00:01:58.890> stem<00:01:59.340> do<00:01:59.610> you<00:01:59.670> see<00:01:59.909> the<00:02:00.270> place

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
on the stem do you see the place

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.639 
on the stem do you see the place
well<00:02:01.200> the<00:02:02.100> clip<00:02:02.430> is<00:02:02.700> thicker<00:02:03.180> than<00:02:03.719> the<00:02:04.290> width

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
well the clip is thicker than the width

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:07.219 
well the clip is thicker than the width
of<00:02:04.860> that<00:02:04.920> slot<00:02:05.549> now<00:02:06.210> uncle<00:02:06.360> Steve<00:02:06.750> tried

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
of that slot now uncle Steve tried

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.520 
of that slot now uncle Steve tried
filing<00:02:08.160> the<00:02:08.610> edges<00:02:09.119> the<00:02:09.360> inner<00:02:09.539> edges<00:02:10.140> of<00:02:10.410> this

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
filing the edges the inner edges of this

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:11.680 
filing the edges the inner edges of this
clip<00:02:10.920> too

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
clip too

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:14.080 
clip too
it<00:02:11.870> fit<00:02:12.140> into<00:02:12.350> the<00:02:12.530> slaw<00:02:12.890> but<00:02:13.550> he<00:02:13.640> found<00:02:13.910> that

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
it fit into the slaw but he found that

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:15.760 
it fit into the slaw but he found that
the<00:02:14.210> clip<00:02:14.450> was<00:02:14.630> made<00:02:14.660> of<00:02:15.080> really<00:02:15.530> hard

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:15.770 
the clip was made of really hard

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:17.620 
the clip was made of really hard
material<00:02:16.430> and<00:02:16.550> that<00:02:16.670> Steve<00:02:17.000> doesn't<00:02:17.240> have

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630 
material and that Steve doesn't have

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:19.990 
material and that Steve doesn't have
even<00:02:18.410> the<00:02:18.500> right<00:02:18.650> kind<00:02:18.920> of<00:02:19.040> files<00:02:19.310> to<00:02:19.700> try<00:02:19.940> to

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
even the right kind of files to try to

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.110 
even the right kind of files to try to
make<00:02:20.480> any<00:02:20.720> progress<00:02:21.160> filing<00:02:22.160> it<00:02:22.280> down<00:02:22.520> to<00:02:22.970> make

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
make any progress filing it down to make

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.270 
make any progress filing it down to make
it<00:02:23.150> thin<00:02:23.600> enough<00:02:23.630> then<00:02:24.590> uncle<00:02:24.830> Steve<00:02:24.980> got<00:02:25.160> an

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
it thin enough then uncle Steve got an

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.810 
it thin enough then uncle Steve got an
idea

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:25.820

now what you see in this picture is two

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.820 
now what you see in this picture is two
kinds<00:02:31.670> of<00:02:31.760> wire<00:02:31.970> the<00:02:32.570> swirl<00:02:32.960> of<00:02:33.200> wire<00:02:33.440> in<00:02:33.770> the

Steve<00:02:36.590> is<00:02:36.740> using<00:02:37.070> right<00:02:37.220> now<00:02:37.250> and<00:02:37.730> it's

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:38.270 
Steve is using right now and it's

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:40.540 
Steve is using right now and it's
galvanized<00:02:38.900> number<00:02:39.320> twenty-two<00:02:39.890> steel<00:02:40.220> wire

stainless steel wire that he bought for
making<00:02:59.510> lures<00:02:59.900> it's<00:03:00.560> the<00:03:00.800> correct<00:03:01.130> diameter

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
making lures it's the correct diameter

fitting to the slot he already has the

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.190 
fitting to the slot he already has the
tools<00:03:04.340> that<00:03:04.550> he<00:03:04.790> would<00:03:04.940> need<00:03:05.240> to<00:03:05.810> work<00:03:05.960> with

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:06.200 
tools that he would need to work with

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.010

that wire to shape it the arrows

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:12.280 
that wire to shape it the arrows
pointing<00:03:09.590> to<00:03:09.650> the<00:03:09.860> first<00:03:10.310> try<00:03:10.790> and<00:03:11.210> you<00:03:11.810> kind

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
pointing to the first try and you kind

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:15.160 
pointing to the first try and you kind
of<00:03:12.410> can<00:03:12.590> see<00:03:12.650> that<00:03:13.640> it<00:03:13.760> was<00:03:13.850> meant<00:03:14.090> to<00:03:14.150> be<00:03:14.270> wrap

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.170 
of can see that it was meant to be wrap

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:18.280 
of can see that it was meant to be wrap
around<00:03:15.590> and<00:03:16.250> it<00:03:16.370> works<00:03:16.580> fine<00:03:16.940> but<00:03:17.750> uncle<00:03:18.080> Steve

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290 
around and it works fine but uncle Steve

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:21.400 
around and it works fine but uncle Steve
thought<00:03:18.800> he<00:03:19.459> could<00:03:19.610> do<00:03:19.760> better<00:03:20.170> maybe<00:03:21.170> he

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:21.410 
thought he could do better maybe he

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:24.160 
thought he could do better maybe he
could<00:03:21.560> simplify<00:03:21.890> it<00:03:22.130> so<00:03:22.400> now<00:03:23.270> the<00:03:23.330> clip<00:03:23.870> on<00:03:24.020> the

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.170 
could simplify it so now the clip on the

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:27.400 
could simplify it so now the clip on the
far<00:03:24.410> left<00:03:24.739> is<00:03:25.340> simpler<00:03:26.000> and<00:03:26.150> would<00:03:26.720> take<00:03:26.959> fewer

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:27.410 
far left is simpler and would take fewer

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:30.930 
far left is simpler and would take fewer
bends<00:03:28.190> to<00:03:28.820> do<00:03:29.030> and<00:03:29.360> that<00:03:29.870> one<00:03:30.050> works<00:03:30.230> fine<00:03:30.590> also

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940 
bends to do and that one works fine also

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:34.660 
bends to do and that one works fine also
then<00:03:31.940> uncle<00:03:32.239> Steve<00:03:32.450> kind<00:03:32.870> of<00:03:33.020> remembered<00:03:33.709> some

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:34.670 
then uncle Steve kind of remembered some

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:38.050 
then uncle Steve kind of remembered some
clips<00:03:35.000> that<00:03:35.120> he<00:03:35.900> has<00:03:36.560> seen<00:03:37.010> in<00:03:37.370> industrial<00:03:38.000> use

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:38.060 
clips that he has seen in industrial use

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:40.780 
clips that he has seen in industrial use
and<00:03:38.270> so<00:03:38.989> he<00:03:39.020> bent<00:03:39.680> the<00:03:39.739> one<00:03:40.040> that's<00:03:40.280> at<00:03:40.489> the<00:03:40.580> top

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:40.790 
and so he bent the one that's at the top

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:44.170 
and so he bent the one that's at the top
and<00:03:41.150> that<00:03:41.180> one<00:03:41.810> works<00:03:42.050> fine<00:03:42.620> also<00:03:43.100> but<00:03:44.060> you

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:44.180 
and that one works fine also but you

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:47.620 
and that one works fine also but you
know<00:03:44.300> that<00:03:44.510> one<00:03:44.780> it's<00:03:45.590> sort<00:03:46.370> of<00:03:46.610> close<00:03:47.239> to<00:03:47.510> the

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:47.630 
know that one it's sort of close to the

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:50.320 
know that one it's sort of close to the
e<00:03:47.660> clip<00:03:48.170> but<00:03:48.470> the<00:03:48.800> clip<00:03:49.430> design<00:03:49.850> on<00:03:50.030> the<00:03:50.150> bottom

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:50.330 
e clip but the clip design on the bottom

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:52.240 
e clip but the clip design on the bottom
is<00:03:50.780> actually<00:03:51.230> the<00:03:51.380> one<00:03:51.560> that<00:03:51.769> uncle<00:03:52.040> Steve

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:52.250 
is actually the one that uncle Steve

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:55.479 
is actually the one that uncle Steve
decided<00:03:52.910> finally<00:03:53.209> to<00:03:53.420> make<00:03:53.810> and<00:03:54.110> to<00:03:54.830> use<00:03:55.100> as

00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:55.489 
decided finally to make and to use as

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:57.940 
decided finally to make and to use as
the<00:03:55.700> final<00:03:55.730> design<00:03:56.450> and<00:03:56.780> that<00:03:57.380> one<00:03:57.650> actually

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:57.950 
the final design and that one actually

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:02.070 
the final design and that one actually
acts<00:03:58.940> the<00:03:59.360> most<00:03:59.660> like<00:04:00.140> the<00:04:00.440> e<00:04:00.680> clip<00:04:01.160> now

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:02.080 
acts the most like the e clip now

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:05.620 
acts the most like the e clip now
remember<00:04:03.080> that<00:04:03.110> the<00:04:03.530> clip<00:04:03.830> is<00:04:04.070> meant<00:04:04.400> to<00:04:04.640> slide

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:05.630 
remember that the clip is meant to slide

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:09.580 
remember that the clip is meant to slide
onto<00:04:06.110> and<00:04:06.800> in<00:04:07.190> that<00:04:07.700> slot<00:04:08.120> on<00:04:08.450> the<00:04:08.600> stamp<00:04:08.870> can

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:09.590 
onto and in that slot on the stamp can

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:12.580 
onto and in that slot on the stamp can
you<00:04:09.739> see<00:04:09.980> it<00:04:10.130> okay<00:04:10.910> here's<00:04:11.810> how<00:04:12.019> uncle<00:04:12.350> Steve

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:12.590 
you see it okay here's how uncle Steve

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:15.699 
you see it okay here's how uncle Steve
made<00:04:13.010> that<00:04:13.280> final<00:04:13.790> shape<00:04:14.480> there's<00:04:15.110> a<00:04:15.290> piece<00:04:15.530> of

00:04:15.699 --> 00:04:15.709 
made that final shape there's a piece of

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:19.300 
made that final shape there's a piece of
wire<00:04:15.920> and<00:04:16.280> he<00:04:16.880> used<00:04:17.239> the<00:04:17.540> e<00:04:17.570> clip<00:04:18.169> as<00:04:18.380> a<00:04:18.440> guide

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:19.310 
wire and he used the e clip as a guide

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:23.500 
wire and he used the e clip as a guide
for<00:04:19.989> dimensioning<00:04:20.989> the<00:04:21.739> bending<00:04:22.550> process<00:04:22.789> see

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:23.510 
for dimensioning the bending process see

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:24.980 
for dimensioning the bending process see
there's<00:04:23.750> the<00:04:23.930> first<00:04:24.080> Bend

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:24.990 
there's the first Bend

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:28.189 
there's the first Bend
and<00:04:25.080> the<00:04:25.889> angle<00:04:26.400> of<00:04:26.490> the<00:04:26.639> bend<00:04:26.850> is<00:04:27.330> intentional

00:04:28.189 --> 00:04:28.199 
and the angle of the bend is intentional

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:30.620 
and the angle of the bend is intentional
and<00:04:28.380> you'll<00:04:28.770> see<00:04:28.979> how<00:04:29.340> that's<00:04:29.639> so<00:04:29.910> in<00:04:30.180> a<00:04:30.270> moment

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:30.630 
and you'll see how that's so in a moment

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:33.439 
and you'll see how that's so in a moment
now<00:04:31.229> here's<00:04:31.470> the<00:04:31.650> second<00:04:32.039> band<00:04:32.250> the<00:04:32.940> width<00:04:33.240> at

00:04:33.439 --> 00:04:33.449 
now here's the second band the width at

00:04:33.449 --> 00:04:36.379 
now here's the second band the width at
the<00:04:33.479> top<00:04:33.840> is<00:04:34.400> intentional<00:04:35.400> and<00:04:35.550> the<00:04:36.150> two

00:04:36.379 --> 00:04:36.389 
the top is intentional and the two

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:39.860 
the top is intentional and the two
angles<00:04:36.960> are<00:04:37.500> intentional<00:04:38.280> as<00:04:38.460> you<00:04:39.449> can<00:04:39.630> see

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:39.870 
angles are intentional as you can see

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:42.439 
angles are intentional as you can see
here<00:04:40.199> so<00:04:40.919> in<00:04:41.069> other<00:04:41.190> words<00:04:41.490> uncle<00:04:41.910> Steve<00:04:42.150> has

00:04:42.439 --> 00:04:42.449 
here so in other words uncle Steve has

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:46.040 
here so in other words uncle Steve has
come<00:04:42.780> close<00:04:43.139> to<00:04:43.880> replicating<00:04:44.880> the<00:04:45.750> three

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:46.050 
come close to replicating the three

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:49.100 
come close to replicating the three
contact<00:04:46.590> points<00:04:47.009> of<00:04:47.190> a<00:04:47.400> typical<00:04:47.789> Eclipse<00:04:48.660> but

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:49.110 
contact points of a typical Eclipse but

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:51.830 
contact points of a typical Eclipse but
using<00:04:49.530> wire<00:04:49.740> and<00:04:50.039> this<00:04:51.000> is<00:04:51.180> the<00:04:51.300> finalized

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:51.840 
using wire and this is the finalized

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.559 
using wire and this is the finalized
clip<00:04:52.289> it<00:04:52.889> only<00:04:53.039> took<00:04:53.280> a<00:04:53.340> little<00:04:53.880> more<00:04:54.000> bending

00:04:54.559 --> 00:04:54.569 
clip it only took a little more bending

00:04:54.569 --> 00:04:56.689 
clip it only took a little more bending
in<00:04:54.720> snipping<00:04:55.440> off<00:04:55.560> the<00:04:55.770> excess<00:04:56.099> you<00:04:56.370> can<00:04:56.490> see

00:04:56.689 --> 00:04:56.699 
in snipping off the excess you can see

00:04:56.699 --> 00:05:01.150 
in snipping off the excess you can see
that<00:04:57.090> the<00:04:57.509> demo<00:04:57.810> clip<00:04:58.560> is<00:04:58.889> close<00:04:59.759> in<00:05:00.180> shape<00:05:00.750> and

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:01.160 
that the demo clip is close in shape and

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:03.620 
that the demo clip is close in shape and
dimension<00:05:02.160> to<00:05:02.340> the<00:05:02.729> one<00:05:02.940> that<00:05:03.150> uncle<00:05:03.419> Steve

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:03.630 
dimension to the one that uncle Steve

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:05.810 
dimension to the one that uncle Steve
decided<00:05:04.050> was<00:05:04.440> the<00:05:04.800> right<00:05:04.979> one<00:05:05.160> to<00:05:05.310> use<00:05:05.520> and

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:05.820 
decided was the right one to use and

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:08.930 
decided was the right one to use and
there<00:05:06.479> it<00:05:06.570> is<00:05:06.630> in<00:05:07.110> place<00:05:07.590> and<00:05:07.949> notice<00:05:08.639> that<00:05:08.789> it

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:08.940 
there it is in place and notice that it

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:11.719 
there it is in place and notice that it
has<00:05:08.970> three<00:05:09.539> points<00:05:09.900> of<00:05:09.990> contact<00:05:10.400> just<00:05:11.400> the<00:05:11.610> way

00:05:11.719 --> 00:05:11.729 
has three points of contact just the way

00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:14.570 
has three points of contact just the way
an<00:05:11.910> eclipse<00:05:12.570> will<00:05:12.750> have<00:05:12.990> here's<00:05:13.979> another<00:05:14.280> view

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:14.580 
an eclipse will have here's another view

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:17.689 
an eclipse will have here's another view
you<00:05:15.270> can<00:05:15.479> see<00:05:15.720> how<00:05:15.930> it's<00:05:16.289> this<00:05:16.770> diameter<00:05:17.430> wire

00:05:17.689 --> 00:05:17.699 
you can see how it's this diameter wire

00:05:17.699 --> 00:05:21.140 
you can see how it's this diameter wire
notice<00:05:18.389> this<00:05:18.990> diameter<00:05:19.530> wire<00:05:20.039> fits<00:05:20.789> easily

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:21.150 
notice this diameter wire fits easily

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:24.890 
notice this diameter wire fits easily
into<00:05:21.780> the<00:05:21.960> slot<00:05:22.440> as<00:05:22.770> uncle<00:05:23.610> Steve<00:05:23.789> said<00:05:24.210> the

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:24.900 
into the slot as uncle Steve said the

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:26.809 
into the slot as uncle Steve said the
Eclipse<00:05:25.530> that<00:05:25.650> he<00:05:25.770> bought<00:05:26.039> at<00:05:26.280> the<00:05:26.310> hardware

00:05:26.809 --> 00:05:26.819 
Eclipse that he bought at the hardware

00:05:26.819 --> 00:05:29.480 
Eclipse that he bought at the hardware
store<00:05:26.880> would<00:05:27.659> have<00:05:27.780> been<00:05:27.990> correct<00:05:28.229> except<00:05:29.070> it

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:29.490 
store would have been correct except it

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:32.149 
store would have been correct except it
was<00:05:29.909> twice<00:05:30.419> the<00:05:30.449> thickness<00:05:31.199> of<00:05:31.380> this<00:05:31.620> wire<00:05:31.889> and

00:05:32.149 --> 00:05:32.159 
was twice the thickness of this wire and

00:05:32.159 --> 00:05:34.490 
was twice the thickness of this wire and
therefore<00:05:32.909> would<00:05:33.090> not<00:05:33.120> slide<00:05:33.690> into<00:05:34.050> that<00:05:34.229> slot

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:34.500 
therefore would not slide into that slot

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:37.640 
therefore would not slide into that slot
here's<00:05:35.370> another<00:05:35.669> view<00:05:35.940> and<00:05:36.240> if<00:05:37.080> you<00:05:37.229> wanted<00:05:37.500> to

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:37.650 
here's another view and if you wanted to

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:40.279 
here's another view and if you wanted to
take<00:05:37.830> this<00:05:38.009> clip<00:05:38.280> off<00:05:38.550> you<00:05:38.849> can<00:05:39.030> see<00:05:39.300> how<00:05:39.599> you

00:05:40.279 --> 00:05:40.289 
take this clip off you can see how you

00:05:40.289 --> 00:05:42.770 
take this clip off you can see how you
could<00:05:40.469> easily<00:05:40.620> do<00:05:41.099> it<00:05:41.280> just<00:05:42.060> pushing<00:05:42.599> with

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:42.780 
could easily do it just pushing with

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:45.860 
could easily do it just pushing with
both<00:05:43.020> your<00:05:43.259> thumbs<00:05:43.590> on<00:05:43.919> those<00:05:44.190> two<00:05:44.550> tabs<00:05:45.090> they

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:45.870 
both your thumbs on those two tabs they

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:48.110 
both your thumbs on those two tabs they
serve<00:05:46.139> a<00:05:46.169> purpose<00:05:46.259> too<00:05:46.889> and<00:05:47.130> the<00:05:47.789> clip<00:05:47.969> would

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:48.120 
serve a purpose too and the clip would

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:50.529 
serve a purpose too and the clip would
come<00:05:48.330> right<00:05:48.509> off<00:05:48.560> because<00:05:49.560> the<00:05:50.009> clip<00:05:50.280> is

00:05:50.529 --> 00:05:50.539 
come right off because the clip is

00:05:50.539 --> 00:05:53.810 
come right off because the clip is
spring-like<00:05:51.539> it<00:05:52.080> doesn't<00:05:52.590> distort<00:05:53.039> and<00:05:53.400> it

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:53.820 
spring-like it doesn't distort and it

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:55.700 
spring-like it doesn't distort and it
holds<00:05:54.060> its<00:05:54.360> dimensions<00:05:54.960> so<00:05:55.110> you<00:05:55.199> can<00:05:55.409> put<00:05:55.590> the

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:55.710 
holds its dimensions so you can put the

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:57.649 
holds its dimensions so you can put the
clip<00:05:55.949> on<00:05:56.130> and<00:05:56.400> take<00:05:56.580> it<00:05:56.610> off<00:05:56.880> a<00:05:57.210> number<00:05:57.509> of

00:05:57.649 --> 00:05:57.659 
clip on and take it off a number of

00:05:57.659 --> 00:06:00.230 
clip on and take it off a number of
times<00:05:57.990> so<00:05:58.830> here<00:05:59.130> again<00:05:59.370> you<00:05:59.610> see<00:05:59.820> the

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:00.240 
times so here again you see the
