 then the contest officially starts e 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:43.190
 what are the rules are very much 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:46.700
 simple 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:50.270
 then to start the contest now 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:51.920
 remains a book we can do that yes 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:54.340
 first let's take then a take 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:57.379
 moment our little booklet 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:01:01.970
 we can however just a case says 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:03.379
 this little book and book book stuff is there 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:03.860
 one of the sheets needs the holes ce 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:06.830
 we 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:08.840
 or that he has a couple of sheets but they are 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:12.260
 bari we have the books directly or that 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:16.070
 we have a very good book boo keun 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:21.800
 needs a piece of this in 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:23.090
 csac plus this indeed no look book in 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.820
 that is fine 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:28.340
 all three together then 1 2 and 3 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.750
 very well in this way we register what 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.540
 you can do so to be able to participate 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:36.260
 to the contest 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:37.960
 ok very simple network these three different 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:42.290
 passages make a first comment 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:44.390
 comment below in the script 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:46.070
 quietly to read it again 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:49.960
 comment below 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:51.920
 therefore in the comments for veroli comments 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:54.170
 seems quite useless as tardini 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:57.530
 comedy comment below with 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:02:01.300
 written three string we talk assigns 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.300
 you have to write your nickname minecraft 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:05.960
 then 7 premium 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:09.260
 you will have a skinner if you are not 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:13.160
 he would have it then we will decide where with 

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:14.600
 the thing you want to do ie what you want 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.750
 your pg 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:21.440
 if it will be extracted then for 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:26.300
 example a job you have to type stay 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:31.250
 firm that I am guarding etcetera 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:35.690
 in short, the third is why you want 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:38.660
 that there is a pg in the ulisse kraft one is 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:42.860
 went in to the belgium cup so you have to 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:50.120
 write the reason he wants to participate in the 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:52.790
 contest in a simple way ok very well 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.170
 so he did this and you will have these 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:56.120
 all three strings will be there 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:59.000
 participants the participants well 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.630
 almost participants who had written 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:05.220
 these 3 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:08.550
 things will be automatically taken and 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:12.930
 inserted in a small database a 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:19.290
 small txt place txt then it will serve because 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:20.900
 we should do a let's say a draw 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:25.860
 to choose the winner 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:29.760
 mainly will we say 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:32.280
 the winner chosen in two ways indeed 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:35.760
 two winners are a winner who 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:39.030
 will be sufficient chosen by the system 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:42.980
 random and then will be inserted a 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:47.090
 second instead that will be inserted if 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:49.980
 will have given a very nice answer e 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:52.260
 however different from the usual ones 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:53.650
 answers that are given in this type 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:56.980
