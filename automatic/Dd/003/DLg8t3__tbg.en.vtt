I'm<00:00:57.620> gyming<00:00:58.190> I<00:00:58.340> say<00:00:58.610> in<00:00:58.960> boulder<00:00:59.960> Club

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.910 

we're<00:01:10.180> sort<00:01:10.480> of<00:01:10.570> the<00:01:10.690> odd<00:01:10.870> band<00:01:11.320> on<00:01:11.590> the<00:01:11.680> tour<00:01:11.890> I

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:11.920
