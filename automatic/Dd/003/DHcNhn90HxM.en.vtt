00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:22.540
 and finally we have three packages of 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:25.090
 mary cookies that can also be 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:27.090

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:29.460
 sweet cookie 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.619

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.659
 Place all ingredients in 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.460
 the blender first let's place the 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:38.009
 cream cheese and then both 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.409
 Milk cans once incorporated 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:44.479
 the two milk cans add the 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.479
 quarter cup of lemon juice 

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:52.630
 after the three ingredients 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:57.120
 are inside the blender liquefies up 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:57.120
 that the whole mixture remains homogeneous 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:02.590
 when you have the mix ready, we will 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:05.230
 take the mold and put a layer of 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:08.500
 cookies then we put the mixture on 

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:11.100
 the layer of cookies and scatter it with 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.100
 a spoon 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:18.709
 and then we put another layer of cookies and 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:20.920
 we put another layer of mixture and 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:24.349
 we do it until we finish 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.819
 filling all our mold or your country of 

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:27.890
 ready I recommend you to put it a 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:31.219
 time to the refrigerator and you will stay 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:33.870
 more or less like this way you can already 

00:02:31.219 --> 00:02:36.659
 eat it when you want 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.940

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:43.170

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:57.510
 very important your comments me 

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:59.819

 like to see on this channel and that together 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:04.349
 we can learn to do new things 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:07.159
 true thank you very much and see you in the 

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:07.159
 next video 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.970
 hi again I know she sees me 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:13.340
 fired but I have a reason 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:14.900
 important to stay during each 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:17.569
 video we are going to be making a 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:20.000
 section that is called curious data this 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:22.939
 curious fact where we will be talking 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.430
 of very general issues today's topic is 

00:03:22.939 --> 00:03:27.049
 I'll tell you some 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:29.629
 platform statistics so that 

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:32.600
 know her a little better than me 

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:34.880
 they called a lot a lot of attention 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:38.410
 and then you find 61 countries the 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:38.410
 61 different languages 

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:43.600
 to minutes and you imagine every minute it 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:45.490
 upload 100 hours of video on the 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:46.780
 platform the truth this to me 

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:48.880
 was very surprised because if we do 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:51.550
 accounts and multiply by 2,400 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:53.770
 minutes that they have the day to is a lot 

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:56.380
 may these statistics serve you or 

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:58.360
 maybe not but today we already learned something 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:01.360
 again I am very happy that you have 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:03.340
 stayed to this point of the video and of 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:05.800
 I really hope you subscribe to me 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:07.270
 channel and that we can see each Tuesday 

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:08.960
 thank you 

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:11.470
 main 

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:11.470
