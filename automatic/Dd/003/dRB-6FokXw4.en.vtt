bike<00:00:14.929> County<00:00:15.929> your<00:00:16.049> standard<00:00:16.560> 1<00:00:17.430> watt<00:00:17.869> device

00:00:24.589 --> 00:00:24.599 

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:32.369 

beside<00:00:25.599> the<00:00:25.900> 10<00:00:26.439> watt<00:00:26.590> flasher<00:00:30.689> so<00:00:31.689> we'll<00:00:32.140> take

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:32.379 
beside the 10 watt flasher so we'll take

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:34.229 
beside the 10 watt flasher so we'll take
a<00:00:32.410> trip<00:00:32.680> back<00:00:32.890> and<00:00:32.920> look<00:00:33.190> at<00:00:33.309> the<00:00:33.489> planet<00:00:34.059> bike

00:00:34.229 --> 00:00:34.239 
a trip back and look at the planet bike

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:37.830 
a trip back and look at the planet bike
in<00:00:34.449> the<00:00:34.570> fulbright<00:00:35.850> okay<00:00:36.850> so<00:00:36.910> here<00:00:37.329> we<00:00:37.360> are<00:00:37.480> one

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:37.840 
in the fulbright okay so here we are one

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:44.160 
in the fulbright okay so here we are one
drive<00:00:38.140> way<00:00:38.379> later<00:00:39.930> and<00:00:42.510> you<00:00:43.510> might<00:00:43.750> be<00:00:43.900> able<00:00:43.989> to

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:44.170 
drive way later and you might be able to

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:50.229 
drive way later and you might be able to
see<00:00:44.379> it

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:50.239 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:52.420 

and<00:00:50.840> there's<00:00:51.170> what<00:00:51.350> a<00:00:51.379> 10-watt<00:00:51.739> flasher<00:00:52.219> looks

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:52.430 
and there's what a 10-watt flasher looks

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:55.510 
and there's what a 10-watt flasher looks
like<00:00:52.670> in<00:00:52.910> the<00:00:53.059> Braeden<00:00:53.450> daytime<00:00:54.309> all<00:00:55.309> right<00:00:55.489> I

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:55.520 
like in the Braeden daytime all right I

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.610 
like in the Braeden daytime all right I
slowed<00:00:55.879> this<00:00:56.090> section<00:00:56.510> down<00:00:56.690> so<00:00:57.020> you<00:00:57.079> can<00:00:57.350> see

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:57.620 
slowed this section down so you can see

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:00.280 
slowed this section down so you can see
that<00:00:57.920> the<00:00:58.040> planet<00:00:58.489> bike<00:00:58.730> is<00:00:59.140> barely<00:01:00.140> visible

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:00.290 
that the planet bike is barely visible

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:02.560 
that the planet bike is barely visible
next<00:01:00.920> to<00:01:01.010> the<00:01:01.100> 10<00:01:01.280> watt<00:01:01.399> flasher<00:01:01.940> in<00:01:02.090> the<00:01:02.360> full

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:02.570 
next to the 10 watt flasher in the full

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:07.950 
next to the 10 watt flasher in the full
daytime<00:01:05.110> so<00:01:06.110> this<00:01:06.290> is<00:01:06.500> my<00:01:06.680> favorite<00:01:07.100> shot<00:01:07.310> here

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:07.960 
daytime so this is my favorite shot here

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.990 
daytime so this is my favorite shot here
this<00:01:08.960> was<00:01:09.140> really<00:01:09.380> the<00:01:09.500> goal<00:01:09.680> was<00:01:10.550> to<00:01:10.670> create<00:01:10.820> a

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:11.000 
this was really the goal was to create a

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.630 
this was really the goal was to create a
light<00:01:11.270> with<00:01:11.509> enough<00:01:11.990> output<00:01:12.470> that<00:01:13.340> you<00:01:13.399> could

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:13.640 
light with enough output that you could

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.450 
light with enough output that you could
really<00:01:13.909> stand<00:01:14.210> out<00:01:14.479> on<00:01:14.780> a<00:01:14.840> full<00:01:15.530> bright

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:16.460 
really stand out on a full bright

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.170 
really stand out on a full bright
sunshine<00:01:16.940> day<00:01:17.259> pretty<00:01:18.259> much<00:01:18.409> just<00:01:18.680> like<00:01:18.830> a<00:01:19.180> EMS

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:20.180 
sunshine day pretty much just like a EMS

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.840 
sunshine day pretty much just like a EMS
vehicle<00:01:20.630> going<00:01:21.050> down<00:01:21.200> the<00:01:21.320> road<00:01:21.500> and<00:01:22.399> the

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:22.850 
vehicle going down the road and the

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:29.980 
vehicle going down the road and the
Fulton<00:01:23.240> lines<00:01:23.479> will<00:01:23.990> I<00:01:24.200> do<00:01:24.259> that<00:01:28.630> so<00:01:29.630> this<00:01:29.780> clip

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:29.990 
Fulton lines will I do that so this clip

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:32.190 
Fulton lines will I do that so this clip
was<00:01:30.170> taken<00:01:30.530> about<00:01:30.740> 30<00:01:31.070> minutes<00:01:31.429> after<00:01:31.640> sunset

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:32.200 
was taken about 30 minutes after sunset

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.700 
was taken about 30 minutes after sunset
with<00:01:33.200> the<00:01:33.350> unit<00:01:33.649> running<00:01:33.890> at<00:01:34.100> full<00:01:34.340> power

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:35.710 
with the unit running at full power

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:39.070 
with the unit running at full power
this<00:01:36.710> design<00:01:37.100> is<00:01:37.399> ideally<00:01:38.270> run<00:01:38.539> off<00:01:38.690> of<00:01:38.720> a

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:39.080 
this design is ideally run off of a

this design is ideally run off of a

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:42.409 
three cell lithium ion pack which is

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:44.410 
three cell lithium ion pack which is
nominally<00:01:42.890> 11.1<00:01:43.670> but<00:01:44.060> you<00:01:44.179> could

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420 
nominally 11.1 but you could

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.779 
nominally 11.1 but you could
realistically<00:01:45.140> use<00:01:45.619> any<00:01:45.860> battery<00:01:46.310> down<00:01:46.580> to

00:01:46.779 --> 00:01:46.789 
realistically use any battery down to

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:50.830 
realistically use any battery down to
about<00:01:47.000> six<00:01:47.330> volts<00:01:48.490> at<00:01:49.490> full<00:01:49.819> power<00:01:50.060> the<00:01:50.240> six

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 
about six volts at full power the six

about six volts at full power the six
Cree<00:01:51.140> LEDs<00:01:51.170> put<00:01:52.009> out<00:01:52.130> roughly<00:01:52.780> 495<00:01:53.780> lumens

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:54.909 
Cree LEDs put out roughly 495 lumens

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:58.060 
Cree LEDs put out roughly 495 lumens
which<00:01:55.909> is<00:01:56.180> more<00:01:57.170> than<00:01:57.380> double<00:01:57.590> the<00:01:57.799> light

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:58.070 
which is more than double the light

which is more than double the light

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:04.729 
tail light and at night you could

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:06.459 
tail light and at night you could
definitely<00:02:05.299> argue<00:02:05.659> that<00:02:05.840> this<00:02:06.020> is<00:02:06.229> way<00:02:06.409> too

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:06.469 
definitely argue that this is way too

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:08.949 
definitely argue that this is way too
much<00:02:06.770> power<00:02:07.009> as<00:02:07.610> you<00:02:07.670> can<00:02:08.060> see<00:02:08.299> the<00:02:08.479> intensity

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:08.959 
much power as you can see the intensity

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:11.500 
much power as you can see the intensity
is<00:02:09.170> similar<00:02:09.619> to<00:02:09.829> the<00:02:09.950> car<00:02:10.209> headlights<00:02:11.209> coming

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
is similar to the car headlights coming

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.380 
is similar to the car headlights coming
at<00:02:11.690> the<00:02:11.780> camera<00:02:12.400> but<00:02:13.400> it's<00:02:13.610> nice<00:02:14.030> to<00:02:14.060> have<00:02:14.329> it

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
at the camera but it's nice to have it

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:17.860 
at the camera but it's nice to have it
if<00:02:14.570> you<00:02:14.690> need<00:02:14.840> it<00:02:14.870> especially<00:02:15.470> in<00:02:15.890> the<00:02:16.010> daytime

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
if you need it especially in the daytime

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
allows you to set up to five power

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.300 
allows you to set up to five power

mode<00:02:30.260> so<00:02:31.260> you<00:02:31.290> can<00:02:31.530> turn<00:02:31.650> it<00:02:31.710> way<00:02:31.980> down<00:02:32.340> if

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
mode so you can turn it way down if

you're riding in a group or need to

conserve power or at nighttime as I turn
