00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
this is Rascals glider the smallest of

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:10.490 
this is Rascals glider the smallest of
the<00:00:07.799> legends<00:00:08.519> of<00:00:08.700> Chima<00:00:08.760> sets<00:00:09.690> here<00:00:10.230> in<00:00:10.410> the

the legends of Chima sets here in the
first<00:00:10.830> wave<00:00:11.990> 2013<00:00:12.990> and<00:00:13.340> even<00:00:14.340> though<00:00:14.460> it<00:00:14.639> was

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
first wave 2013 and even though it was

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.529

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
the back with these pieces I thought

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.980 
the back with these pieces I thought
that<00:01:57.630> was<00:01:57.780> clever<00:01:58.430> here<00:01:59.430> is<00:01:59.640> the<00:01:59.880> Chi<00:02:00.210> that<00:02:00.719> is

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
that was clever here is the Chi that is

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:06.889 
that was clever here is the Chi that is
powering<00:02:01.590> the<00:02:02.490> vehicle<00:02:03.000> and<00:02:04.430> we<00:02:05.430> have<00:02:05.899> the

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
powering the vehicle and we have the

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:12.410 
powering the vehicle and we have the
wings<00:02:07.200> of<00:02:07.530> the<00:02:07.590> Raven<00:02:08.330> which<00:02:09.330> also<00:02:09.660> move

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.410 

the<00:02:13.140> tail<00:02:13.440> moves<00:02:13.830> and<00:02:14.190> the<00:02:14.700> wings<00:02:14.970> on<00:02:15.270> the

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
the tail moves and the wings on the

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:20.620 
the tail moves and the wings on the
other<00:02:15.540> side<00:02:16.130> move<00:02:17.130> as<00:02:17.280> well<00:02:17.489> and<00:02:18.050> we<00:02:19.050> do<00:02:19.530> have

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 
other side move as well and we do have

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:25.100 
other side move as well and we do have
some<00:02:21.630> weaponry<00:02:22.110> happening<00:02:22.860> if<00:02:23.090> we<00:02:24.090> push<00:02:24.900> this

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
some weaponry happening if we push this

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.809 
some weaponry happening if we push this
in<00:02:25.970> this<00:02:26.970> will<00:02:27.239> come<00:02:27.450> flying<00:02:28.380> out<00:02:28.770> but<00:02:29.489> it

00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:29.819 
in this will come flying out but it

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:32.570 
in this will come flying out but it
stays<00:02:30.150> attached<00:02:30.600> and<00:02:31.050> just<00:02:31.830> from<00:02:32.130> looking<00:02:32.459> the

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
stays attached and just from looking the

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.699 
stays attached and just from looking the
pictures<00:02:32.970> on<00:02:33.090> the<00:02:33.180> box<00:02:33.480> it<00:02:33.720> looks<00:02:34.080> like<00:02:34.410> this

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
pictures on the box it looks like this

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:38.600 
pictures on the box it looks like this
also<00:02:35.459> may<00:02:35.700> be<00:02:35.760> used<00:02:36.270> to<00:02:36.540> grab<00:02:37.170> Chi<00:02:37.830> so<00:02:38.130> as<00:02:38.340> it

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
also may be used to grab Chi so as it
