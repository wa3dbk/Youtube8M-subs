00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
the most part his sword swings will

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.500 
the most part his sword swings will
never<00:01:09.180> hit<00:01:09.360> me<00:01:09.540> I<00:01:10.369> I'm<00:01:11.369> gonna<00:01:11.700> show<00:01:11.880> you<00:01:11.939> melee

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
I just may laid him for a little bit I

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.999 
I just may laid him for a little bit I
could<00:01:14.760> do<00:01:14.880> that<00:01:15.030> but<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.330> whole<00:01:15.450> fight<00:01:15.780> but<00:01:16.770> I

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
could do that but the whole fight but I

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.039 
could do that but the whole fight but I
am<00:01:17.220> faith-based<00:01:17.700> so<00:01:18.030> I'm<00:01:18.299> gonna<00:01:18.450> just<00:01:18.630> search

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
am faith-based so I'm gonna just search

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:20.810 
am faith-based so I'm gonna just search
their<00:01:19.409> own<00:01:19.530> lightning<00:01:20.159> from<00:01:20.400> side<00:01:20.670> him

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
their own lightning from side him

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.300 
their own lightning from side him
because<00:01:21.030> I<00:01:21.270> mean<00:01:22.170> either<00:01:22.560> way<00:01:22.799> you<00:01:22.860> want<00:01:23.100> to<00:01:23.189> do

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
because I mean either way you want to do

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.999 
because I mean either way you want to do
it<00:01:23.460> if<00:01:23.549> you're<00:01:23.700> a<00:01:23.729> caster<00:01:24.210> or<00:01:24.270> melee<00:01:25.200> you<00:01:25.830> can

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
it if you're a caster or melee you can

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.330 
it if you're a caster or melee you can
see<00:01:26.220> that<00:01:26.520> the<00:01:26.640> strategy<00:01:27.119> works<00:01:27.360> for<00:01:27.600> both<00:01:27.750> and

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340 
see that the strategy works for both and

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.310 
see that the strategy works for both and
in<00:01:29.340> fact<00:01:29.670> he's<00:01:30.090> so<00:01:30.270> easy<00:01:30.509> if<00:01:30.780> you<00:01:30.930> stay<00:01:31.140> behind

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
in fact he's so easy if you stay behind

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.510 
in fact he's so easy if you stay behind
him<00:01:31.619> that<00:01:32.460> I<00:01:32.490> think<00:01:32.790> even<00:01:33.299> if<00:01:33.420> you<00:01:33.600> had<00:01:33.840> him<00:01:34.079> at

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520 
him that I think even if you had him at

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.580 
him that I think even if you had him at
32<00:01:35.520> times<00:01:35.820> defense<00:01:36.360> if<00:01:36.600> you<00:01:36.720> had<00:01:36.869> the<00:01:36.990> patience

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
32 times defense if you had the patience

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.679 
32 times defense if you had the patience
you<00:01:37.770> could<00:01:38.759> probably<00:01:38.970> kill<00:01:39.479> him

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
you could probably kill him

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:43.310 
you could probably kill him
I<00:01:41.210> initially<00:01:42.210> had<00:01:42.570> a<00:01:42.600> lot<00:01:42.750> of<00:01:42.780> trouble<00:01:43.170> with

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
I initially had a lot of trouble with

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.050 
I initially had a lot of trouble with
him<00:01:43.470> cuz<00:01:43.619> I<00:01:43.710> was<00:01:43.829> trying<00:01:44.040> to<00:01:44.100> fight<00:01:44.340> him<00:01:44.520> front

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
him cuz I was trying to fight him front

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.749 
him cuz I was trying to fight him front
to<00:01:45.329> front<00:01:45.560> once<00:01:46.560> I<00:01:46.710> realized<00:01:47.100> you<00:01:47.340> just<00:01:47.369> got<00:01:47.670> to

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
to front once I realized you just got to

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.319 
to front once I realized you just got to
stay<00:01:47.909> behind<00:01:48.060> him<00:01:48.450> wow<00:01:49.320> it's<00:01:49.970> quite<00:01:50.970> a<00:01:51.119> bit

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
stay behind him wow it's quite a bit

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:54.679 
stay behind him wow it's quite a bit
easier<00:01:51.450> so<00:01:52.880> once<00:01:53.880> you<00:01:54.060> kill<00:01:54.360> the<00:01:54.479> King

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
easier so once you kill the King

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.780 
easier so once you kill the King
vendrick<00:01:54.899> one<00:01:55.320> thing<00:01:55.530> to<00:01:55.649> note<00:01:55.860> is<00:01:56.100> that<00:01:56.549> you

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
vendrick one thing to note is that you

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.950 
vendrick one thing to note is that you
