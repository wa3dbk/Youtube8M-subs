again

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:39.740 
again

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.670 
again
that's<00:01:40.310> the<00:01:40.700> s3<00:01:41.150> without<00:01:41.509> flash<00:01:41.840> and<00:01:42.320> that's

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 
the s3 with flash let's go to back again

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:47.430 
the s3 with flash let's go to back again
so<00:01:45.740> we<00:01:45.829> can<00:01:45.950> see<00:01:46.070> a<00:01:46.100> different

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:47.440 
so we can see a different

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.620 
so we can see a different
there<00:01:48.070> you<00:01:48.190> go<00:01:48.370> and<00:01:48.610> I<00:01:48.670> think<00:01:48.910> that's<00:01:49.420> what

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:49.630 
there you go and I think that's what

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:52.560 
there you go and I think that's what
PureView<00:01:50.110> technology<00:01:50.250> is<00:01:51.250> all<00:01:51.550> about<00:01:51.910> we<00:01:52.360> know

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:52.570 
PureView technology is all about we know

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:54.570 
PureView technology is all about we know
how<00:01:52.780> superior<00:01:53.230> this<00:01:53.590> is<00:01:53.800> compared<00:01:54.310> to<00:01:54.430> other

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:54.580 
how superior this is compared to other

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:57.930 
how superior this is compared to other
cameras<00:01:55.570> and<00:01:55.780> phones<00:01:56.070> but<00:01:57.070> especially<00:01:57.280> when

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:57.940 
cameras and phones but especially when

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:02.550 
cameras and phones but especially when
you<00:01:58.420> compare<00:01:58.600> this<00:01:59.020> to<00:01:59.560> the<00:02:01.290> flagship<00:02:02.290> phone

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:02.560 
you compare this to the flagship phone

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.700 
you compare this to the flagship phone
from<00:02:03.160> samsung<00:02:03.400> with<00:02:04.320> definitely<00:02:05.320> great
