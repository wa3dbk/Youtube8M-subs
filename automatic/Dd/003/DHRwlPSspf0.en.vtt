00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
inside steps as well okay so it's a

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.069 
inside steps as well okay so it's a
beautiful<00:02:02.820> thing<00:02:03.329> now<00:02:03.750> we're<00:02:03.930> going<00:02:04.020> to

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
beautiful thing now we're going to

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:08.630 
beautiful thing now we're going to
transition<00:02:05.600> into<00:02:06.600> the<00:02:06.719> hopping<00:02:07.200> step<00:02:07.439> okay<00:02:07.890> so

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
transition into the hopping step okay so

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.820 
transition into the hopping step okay so
the<00:02:08.759> hopping<00:02:09.149> step<00:02:09.390> is<00:02:09.569> the<00:02:09.720> same<00:02:09.989> it's<00:02:10.649> a

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
the hopping step is the same it's a

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.620 
the hopping step is the same it's a
closed<00:02:11.099> stance

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
closed stance

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:15.560 
closed stance

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:18.960 
the people that are practicing this what

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:20.270 
the people that are practicing this what
they'll<00:02:19.110> notice<00:02:19.470> is<00:02:19.650> they<00:02:19.770> will<00:02:19.950> be<00:02:19.980> out<00:02:20.250> of

right<00:02:31.350> which<00:02:31.620> is<00:02:31.830> more<00:02:32.100> dynamic<00:02:32.390> all<00:02:33.390> right<00:02:33.600> so

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500

right which is more dynamic all right so
I'm<00:02:34.620> going<00:02:34.770> to<00:02:34.830> have<00:02:35.040> you<00:02:35.190> alternate<00:02:36.090> between

I'm going to have you alternate between

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.680 
I'm going to have you alternate between
walking<00:02:37.050> and<00:02:37.530> hopping<00:02:38.430> okay<00:02:38.730> that's<00:02:39.540> a

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
walking and hopping okay that's a

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
walking and hopping okay that's a
walking<00:02:40.140> okay<00:02:41.210> that's<00:02:42.210> a<00:02:42.420> hopping<00:02:42.810> all<00:02:43.260> right

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:43.710 
walking okay that's a hopping all right

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:48.260 
walking okay that's a hopping all right
so<00:02:44.070> walking<00:02:44.430> step<00:02:45.020> okay<00:02:46.260> hopping<00:02:46.980> step<00:02:47.270> all

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.270 
so walking step okay hopping step all

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:53.240 
so walking step okay hopping step all
right<00:02:48.590> okay<00:02:49.590> walking<00:02:50.040> step<00:02:50.490> and<00:02:51.980> hopping<00:02:52.980> step

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
right okay walking step and hopping step

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.060 
right okay walking step and hopping step
so<00:02:53.700> every<00:02:54.060> time<00:02:54.270> I'm<00:02:54.540> going<00:02:54.690> back<00:02:54.930> behind<00:02:55.380> this

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.070 
so every time I'm going back behind this

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:58.220 
so every time I'm going back behind this
every<00:02:56.580> time<00:02:56.790> correct<00:02:57.360> and<00:02:57.570> then<00:02:57.960> I'm<00:02:58.050> moving

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
every time correct and then I'm moving

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.470 
every time correct and then I'm moving
the<00:02:59.100> reason<00:02:59.400> why<00:02:59.490> it's<00:02:59.640> important<00:03:00.030> to<00:03:00.060> do<00:03:00.240> that

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
the reason why it's important to do that

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.890 
the reason why it's important to do that
is<00:03:00.750> to<00:03:01.650> learn<00:03:01.920> the<00:03:02.490> back<00:03:02.670> and<00:03:02.910> forth<00:03:03.180> okay<00:03:03.840> so

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
is to learn the back and forth okay so

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.080 
is to learn the back and forth okay so
that<00:03:04.170> you<00:03:04.320> move<00:03:04.440> in<00:03:04.680> and<00:03:04.920> then<00:03:05.790> you<00:03:05.910> move<00:03:06.060> back

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
that you move in and then you move back

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:10.160 
that you move in and then you move back
to<00:03:06.450> create<00:03:06.750> space<00:03:08.480> just<00:03:09.480> like<00:03:09.600> that<00:03:09.900> what<00:03:10.140> I

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
to create space just like that what I

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.260 
to create space just like that what I
love<00:03:10.440> about<00:03:10.620> watching<00:03:11.160> you<00:03:11.250> do<00:03:11.430> this<00:03:11.610> will<00:03:12.030> is

steps already so I have other footwork

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:21.260 
steps already so I have other footwork

do some hybrids as well okay which shows

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:30.050 
do some hybrids as well okay which shows
to<00:03:26.940> me<00:03:27.120> that<00:03:27.150> it's<00:03:28.110> starting<00:03:28.470> to<00:03:28.500> sink<00:03:28.830> in<00:03:29.060> all

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
to me that it's starting to sink in all
