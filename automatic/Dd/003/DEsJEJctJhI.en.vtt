 Hello today I want you the top 5 

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:10.670
 Destinations for geeks and nerds 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:13.250
 imagine 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:14.299
 in fifth place is cardiff bay in 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:16.820
 cardiff wales 

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:18.109
 there you will find the pot or the 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:21.439
 torchwood pope I know that the 

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:23.449
 Right technique article is the death has 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:24.680
 In any case, death knows that is one 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:26.060
 spin off from doctor who probably 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:29.300
 know what I'm talking Germany have 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:32.599
 is the center where the team is always 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:34.010
 so meets her base and there is 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:35.809
 just the entrance at cardiff bay the 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:36.739
 you can still find me and me 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:38.510
 now nothing should be on everyone 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:40.280
 case in episode episode dies 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:41.629
 important character and since then 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:45.379
 actually this entrance in cardiff 

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:46.760
 as a kind of resting place as a shrine to 

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:49.010
 Of course, this character uses this character 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.840
 also something funny or macabre or too 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.850
 simply absurd for a fictional character 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.930
 but it is also very cute and somehow 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:55.489
 Above all, the windows come in place 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:57.620
 Letters read through together 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:01:00.199
 photos hung there were lying 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:02.120
 partially flowers everything you can 

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:03.620
 before finding it's funny and 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.510
 should value brands of course 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:07.670
 make sure to travel then 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:09.619
 Fourth , I have sherlock speedys 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.510

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:12.890
 that of the cafés and should too 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:14.680
 absolutely go that is in the 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:16.880
 Moscow street in London 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:18.590
 You can just go and see yourself 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.310
 for example, a job or a motzen 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.140
 order web 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.939
 and for fans of the series that's cool 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.470
 was already there and very tasty and 

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:26.150
 is fun to go there and actually 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:28.100
 also to sit at the places where also 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:31.310
 the actors have been before 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:35.990
 then in third place I have star wars 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:37.700
 Tunisia in Tunisia is numerous 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:40.460
 movie stars by stars and up to episode 5 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.750
 I have all the films there too 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.369
 would not be on your own now 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.299
 because you can blow some I watch 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:45.680
 then you would just what in 

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:48.240
 Write infobox and you can do it yourself 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:51.790
 Let's see where you want to go 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:54.070
 then on place two oxford the screech 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:55.540
 that christchurch college is there eg 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:02:00.430
 A room will be the big hall in Harry 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:01.840
 potter has inspired and so are 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:03.130
 really movie by harry potter 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.230
 namely, the stairs and stairs are the ones for wood 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:06.880
 oxford is also still in use 

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:09.040
 Interesting because of course one 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.780
 Tolkien places such there has 

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:13.060
 taught and there is also the 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.470
 grave of Tolkien and also the pub in the 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.850
 have always met against each other 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:16.150
 Oxford is definitely also a journey 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:18.460
 value 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.990
 and as my number a freestyle team 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:22.630
 Of course I hope so 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:24.280
 written on it or matamata in 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:25.960
 New Zealand, of course, is not that 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.580
 only travel so the place you give them the 

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:29.740
 visit only theme in new zealand 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.600
 but should come I would say that 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:32.950
 the ultimate goal if I know that 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.910
 I'll visit it someday 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.280
 and then I will be the green one 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:36.900
 drink something and kite 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.110
 like a have to, I'm looking forward 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.110
 it 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:15.550
 if you have the child I do not have much 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:17.080
 to say that if you do not know her 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:18.100
 should look infobox and through the 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:19.870
 must see 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:24.000
 I thought yes it's my humor 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:24.000
 is really funny then
