and<00:01:05.189> I<00:01:05.280> think<00:01:05.309> coming<00:01:05.670> off<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:05.939> bench<00:01:06.090> backing

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
and I think coming off the bench backing

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.690 
and I think coming off the bench backing
up<00:01:06.630> Dwight<00:01:06.840> Howard<00:01:07.170> as<00:01:07.290> the<00:01:07.920> backup<00:01:08.100> center<00:01:08.460> is

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
up Dwight Howard as the backup center is

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.160 
up Dwight Howard as the backup center is
a<00:01:08.729> vital<00:01:09.150> role<00:01:09.270> he<00:01:09.390> gives<00:01:09.600> him<00:01:09.750> a<00:01:09.810> viable

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
a vital role he gives him a viable

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.200 
a vital role he gives him a viable
option<00:01:10.290> in<00:01:10.619> the<00:01:10.680> low<00:01:10.770> post<00:01:10.950> off<00:01:11.220> the<00:01:11.369> bench<00:01:11.580> but

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
option in the low post off the bench but

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.940
