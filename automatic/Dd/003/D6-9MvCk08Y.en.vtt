even triple so here in this example I am

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:37.259 
even triple so here in this example I am
at<00:00:35.980> the<00:00:36.129> end<00:00:36.280> of<00:00:36.370> a<00:00:36.460> row<00:00:36.640> so<00:00:36.940> I'm<00:00:37.030> just<00:00:37.149> gonna

00:00:37.259 --> 00:00:37.269 
at the end of a row so I'm just gonna

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:43.030 
my pattern tells me to change three

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:45.149 
my pattern tells me to change three
because<00:00:43.539> I'm<00:00:43.719> double<00:00:44.199> crocheting<00:00:44.649> we're

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:45.159 
because I'm double crocheting we're

00:00:45.159 --> 00:00:48.090 
because I'm double crocheting we're
gonna<00:00:45.309> flip<00:00:45.489> it<00:00:45.640> over<00:00:45.760> and<00:00:46.589> for<00:00:47.589> this<00:00:47.710> one<00:00:47.920> what

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:48.100

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:51.760 
we need to do is we need to do half of a

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.459 
we need to do is we need to do half of a
shell<00:00:52.059> so<00:00:52.480> to<00:00:52.539> do<00:00:52.809> that<00:00:52.839> we're<00:00:53.230> just<00:00:53.319> gonna

00:00:53.459 --> 00:00:53.469 
shell so to do that we're just gonna

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:55.559 
shell so to do that we're just gonna
we're<00:00:53.980> going<00:00:54.129> to<00:00:54.190> mimic<00:00:54.460> it<00:00:54.670> right<00:00:54.999> here<00:00:55.359> at

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:55.569 
we're going to mimic it right here at

00:00:55.569 --> 00:01:00.209 
we're going to mimic it right here at
the<00:00:55.719> end<00:00:56.489> by<00:00:57.489> just<00:00:58.120> double<00:00:59.109> crocheting<00:00:59.530> at<00:00:59.979> the

00:01:00.209 --> 00:01:00.219 
the end by just double crocheting at the

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:05.189 
the end by just double crocheting at the
base<00:01:00.460> of<00:01:00.489> the<00:01:00.760> chain<00:01:02.339> twice<00:01:03.339> in<00:01:03.760> one<00:01:03.940> hole<00:01:04.239> and

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:05.199 
base of the chain twice in one hole and

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:08.490 
base of the chain twice in one hole and
go<00:01:05.409> and<00:01:05.740> then<00:01:06.460> to<00:01:07.030> make<00:01:07.240> the<00:01:07.420> actual<00:01:07.719> shell<00:01:08.200> the

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:08.500 
go and then to make the actual shell the

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:12.600 
go and then to make the actual shell the
dip<00:01:09.070> what<00:01:09.520> we<00:01:09.670> do<00:01:09.850> is<00:01:09.969> we<00:01:10.119> skip<00:01:10.509> two<00:01:10.840> and<00:01:11.610> we

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:12.610 
dip what we do is we skip two and we

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:14.789 
dip what we do is we skip two and we
just<00:01:12.880> do<00:01:13.000> a<00:01:13.030> single<00:01:13.329> crochet<00:01:13.869> in<00:01:14.200> the<00:01:14.770> third

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:14.799 
just do a single crochet in the third

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:17.910 
just do a single crochet in the third
one<00:01:15.310> from<00:01:15.490> the<00:01:15.549> hook<00:01:15.790> there<00:01:16.590> so<00:01:17.590> we'll<00:01:17.710> just<00:01:17.799> do

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:17.920 
one from the hook there so we'll just do

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:19.679 
one from the hook there so we'll just do
a<00:01:17.950> single<00:01:18.159> crochet<00:01:18.490> and<00:01:18.850> see<00:01:19.000> how<00:01:19.119> that<00:01:19.180> pulled

00:01:19.679 --> 00:01:19.689 
a single crochet and see how that pulled

00:01:19.689 --> 00:01:22.770 
a single crochet and see how that pulled
your<00:01:20.380> shell<00:01:20.710> over<00:01:20.979> and<00:01:21.340> now<00:01:22.270> we're<00:01:22.539> going<00:01:22.689> to

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:22.780 
your shell over and now we're going to

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.940 
your shell over and now we're going to
work<00:01:23.020> a<00:01:23.229> full<00:01:23.500> shell<00:01:23.799> so<00:01:24.130> we'll<00:01:24.280> do<00:01:24.430> that<00:01:24.630> they

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
work a full shell so we'll do that they

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.289 
work a full shell so we'll do that they
this<00:01:26.950> particular<00:01:27.219> pattern<00:01:27.549> they<00:01:27.820> stack<00:01:28.090> on

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:28.299 
this particular pattern they stack on

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:31.950 
this particular pattern they stack on
top<00:01:28.329> of<00:01:28.539> each<00:01:28.780> other<00:01:29.909> so<00:01:30.909> what<00:01:31.509> we're<00:01:31.689> going<00:01:31.869> to

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:31.960 
top of each other so what we're going to

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.249 
top of each other so what we're going to
do<00:01:32.229> is<00:01:32.560> go<00:01:32.799> skip<00:01:33.219> to<00:01:33.520> this<00:01:34.509> pattern<00:01:34.750> always

00:01:35.249 --> 00:01:35.259 
do is go skip to this pattern always

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:38.099 
do is go skip to this pattern always
skips<00:01:35.530> two<00:01:35.859> and<00:01:36.159> we're<00:01:36.909> gonna<00:01:37.000> work<00:01:37.299> five

00:01:38.099 --> 00:01:38.109 
skips two and we're gonna work five

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:41.429 
skips two and we're gonna work five
double<00:01:38.590> crochets<00:01:39.159> in<00:01:39.490> the<00:01:39.969> same<00:01:40.299> stitch<00:01:40.439> and

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:41.439 
double crochets in the same stitch and

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:43.469 
double crochets in the same stitch and
that's<00:01:41.560> what<00:01:41.799> makes<00:01:42.070> the<00:01:42.340> actual<00:01:42.700> shell<00:01:43.180> in

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:43.479 
that's what makes the actual shell in

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:47.039 
that's what makes the actual shell in
this<00:01:43.659> case<00:01:44.310> so<00:01:45.310> you<00:01:45.759> can<00:01:45.880> see<00:01:46.179> it<00:01:46.450> sounds

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:47.049 
this case so you can see it sounds

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:49.560 
this case so you can see it sounds
intimidating<00:01:47.590> but<00:01:48.429> it<00:01:48.549> is<00:01:48.729> actually<00:01:49.539> very

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:49.570 
intimidating but it is actually very

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:59.760 
intimidating but it is actually very
easy<00:01:51.240> so<00:01:52.240> there's<00:01:52.390> three<00:01:54.149> four<00:01:56.579> five<00:01:58.770> alright

00:01:59.760 --> 00:01:59.770 
easy so there's three four five alright

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:02.580 
easy so there's three four five alright
so<00:02:00.130> you<00:02:00.219> see<00:02:00.249> it<00:02:00.549> makes<00:02:00.789> your<00:02:01.539> little<00:02:01.780> shell

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:02.590 
so you see it makes your little shell

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:05.249 
so you see it makes your little shell
and<00:02:02.950> then<00:02:03.729> skip<00:02:04.329> two<00:02:04.600> and<00:02:04.630> do<00:02:04.960> a<00:02:04.990> single

00:02:05.249 --> 00:02:05.259 
and then skip two and do a single

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:07.169 
and then skip two and do a single
crochet<00:02:05.409> and<00:02:05.890> that's<00:02:06.070> what<00:02:06.249> locks<00:02:06.520> that<00:02:06.850> shell

00:02:07.169 --> 00:02:07.179 
crochet and that's what locks that shell

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:10.440 
crochet and that's what locks that shell
down<00:02:07.539> and<00:02:07.990> keeps<00:02:08.890> that<00:02:09.100> curve<00:02:09.340> in<00:02:09.520> place<00:02:09.729> so

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
down and keeps that curve in place so

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:12.210 
down and keeps that curve in place so
you<00:02:10.539> just<00:02:10.690> repeat<00:02:11.050> that<00:02:11.080> the<00:02:11.680> number<00:02:11.890> of<00:02:11.920> times

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
you just repeat that the number of times

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:13.740 
you just repeat that the number of times
your<00:02:12.400> pattern<00:02:12.700> says<00:02:12.940> and<00:02:13.239> I'll<00:02:13.330> show<00:02:13.540> you<00:02:13.629> what
