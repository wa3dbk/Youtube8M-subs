okay<00:01:34.190> let's<00:01:34.790> do<00:01:34.970> the<00:01:35.090> math<00:01:35.270> I<00:01:35.570> got<00:01:35.930> to<00:01:36.020> figure

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.200 
okay let's do the math I got to figure

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.810 
okay let's do the math I got to figure
out<00:01:36.320> how<00:01:36.440> to<00:01:36.500> grow<00:01:36.650> four<00:01:36.980> years<00:01:37.280> worth<00:01:37.490> of<00:01:37.640> food

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:37.820 
out how to grow four years worth of food

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.950 
out how to grow four years worth of food
here<00:01:38.450> on<00:01:38.690> a<00:01:39.050> planet<00:01:39.500> where<00:01:39.590> nothing<00:01:39.950> grows<00:01:40.960> but

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:41.960 
here on a planet where nothing grows but

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.000 
here on a planet where nothing grows but
if<00:01:42.050> I<00:01:42.140> can't<00:01:42.320> figure<00:01:42.470> out<00:01:42.590> a<00:01:42.680> way<00:01:42.800> to<00:01:42.860> make

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:43.010 
if I can't figure out a way to make

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:44.740 
if I can't figure out a way to make
contact<00:01:43.460> with<00:01:43.550> NASA<00:01:43.850> none<00:01:44.210> of<00:01:44.330> this<00:01:44.390> matters
