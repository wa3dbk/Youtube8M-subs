00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
guy how on earth

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.070 
guy how on earth
if<00:00:22.230> the<00:00:22.410> park<00:00:22.710> could<00:00:22.890> get<00:00:23.130> a<00:00:23.160> good<00:00:23.789> guy<00:00:24.080> he

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
if the park could get a good guy he

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.920 
if the park could get a good guy he
makes<00:00:25.350> no<00:00:25.619> sense<00:00:26.060> you<00:00:27.060> know<00:00:27.240> I<00:00:27.449> think<00:00:27.660> they're

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
makes no sense you know I think they're

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.370 
makes no sense you know I think they're
just<00:00:28.080> looking<00:00:28.349> struggling<00:00:29.130> to<00:00:29.250> find<00:00:29.490> bosses

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:30.380 
just looking struggling to find bosses

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:32.359 
just looking struggling to find bosses
right<00:00:31.380> now<00:00:31.560> I<00:00:31.590> didn't<00:00:31.830> mention<00:00:31.980> this<00:00:32.189> was

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
right now I didn't mention this was

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.310 
right now I didn't mention this was
backwards<00:00:33.050> and<00:00:34.050> backwards<00:00:34.710> it<00:00:34.800> is<00:00:36.320> your

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
backwards and backwards it is your

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.319 
backwards and backwards it is your
problem<00:00:37.710> for<00:00:38.250> the<00:00:38.309> first<00:00:38.550> part<00:00:38.879> if<00:00:39.090> you<00:00:39.210> get

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
problem for the first part if you get

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.770 
problem for the first part if you get
here<00:00:39.540> our<00:00:39.660> mode<00:00:39.870> first<00:00:40.399> it'll<00:00:41.399> be<00:00:41.640> really<00:00:42.300> easy

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
here our mode first it'll be really easy

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.470 
here our mode first it'll be really easy
he's<00:00:43.649> my<00:00:43.770> bait<00:00:44.010> because<00:00:44.610> in<00:00:44.910> here<00:00:45.059> I<00:00:45.120> made<00:00:45.360> him

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
he's my bait because in here I made him

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.150 
he's my bait because in here I made him
invincible<00:00:45.719> and<00:00:46.500> all<00:00:46.590> you<00:00:46.710> ought<00:00:46.829> to<00:00:46.920> do<00:00:47.039> is

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
invincible and all you ought to do is

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:53.110 
invincible and all you ought to do is
wait<00:00:47.340> for<00:00:47.370> a<00:00:47.579> shield<00:00:47.850> to<00:00:48.000> go<00:00:48.120> down

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:53.120 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.260 

so<00:00:53.720> you're<00:00:53.870> probably<00:00:54.050> gonna<00:00:54.320> want<00:00:55.060> Congo<00:00:56.060> here

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:56.270 
so you're probably gonna want Congo here

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:03.549 
so you're probably gonna want Congo here
because<00:00:56.510> he's<00:00:56.660> fast

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:03.559 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:21.300 

right<00:01:04.559> you<00:01:04.890> have<00:01:05.040> to<00:01:05.159> pay<00:01:05.339> attention

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:21.310 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:26.250 

right<00:01:21.909> there's<00:01:22.210> a<00:01:22.330> kombu<00:01:22.810> mask<00:01:23.760> over<00:01:24.760> here<00:01:25.260> and

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:26.260 
right there's a kombu mask over here and

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:29.889 
right there's a kombu mask over here and
there<00:01:26.500> was<00:01:26.530> a<00:01:26.619> Java<00:01:26.860> mask<00:01:27.100> over<00:01:27.400> there

00:01:29.889 --> 00:01:29.899 

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:35.160 

why<00:01:30.500> for<00:01:30.740> now

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.170 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:37.530 

really<00:01:35.920> have<00:01:36.070> to<00:01:36.190> be<00:01:36.280> careful<00:01:36.700> with<00:01:36.820> axon<00:01:37.270> I

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:37.540 
really have to be careful with axon I

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:39.150 
really have to be careful with axon I
mean<00:01:37.990> if<00:01:38.080> you<00:01:38.170> got<00:01:38.320> here<00:01:38.530> our<00:01:38.680> mode<00:01:38.860> then<00:01:39.040> you

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:39.160 
mean if you got here our mode then you

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:44.940 
mean if you got here our mode then you
find

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:44.950 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:48.490 

yeah<00:01:46.240> basically<00:01:47.240> you<00:01:47.480> starts<00:01:47.990> off<00:01:48.170> and<00:01:48.380> you

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500 
yeah basically you starts off and you

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.160 
yeah basically you starts off and you
you're<00:01:48.860> quite<00:01:49.730> likely<00:01:49.970> tap<00:01:50.390> hero<00:01:50.660> mode<00:01:50.960> when

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.170 
you're quite likely tap hero mode when

00:01:51.170 --> 00:02:00.899 
you're quite likely tap hero mode when
you<00:01:51.290> go<00:01:51.440> into<00:01:51.740> this<00:01:51.860> fight

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:00.909 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:04.490 

right<00:02:01.509> so<00:02:01.689> he<00:02:01.810> sends<00:02:02.170> out<00:02:02.320> these<00:02:02.590> guys

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
right so he sends out these guys

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.570 
right so he sends out these guys
I<00:02:06.470> see<00:02:07.470> the<00:02:07.590> first<00:02:07.830> bit<00:02:07.980> you<00:02:08.009> might<00:02:08.280> want<00:02:08.460> to

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
I see the first bit you might want to

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.130 
I see the first bit you might want to
fire<00:02:08.790> on<00:02:09.119> the<00:02:09.270> state<00:02:09.479> with<00:02:09.630> Congreve<00:02:09.990> the

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
fire on the state with Congreve the

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:20.800 
fire on the state with Congreve the
whole<00:02:10.259> fight<00:02:12.830> right

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.550 

axon

Aslan<00:02:24.560> himself<00:02:24.829> around<00:02:25.370> a<00:02:25.459> bit<00:02:25.900> you<00:02:26.900> not<00:02:27.170> the

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:27.319 
Aslan himself around a bit you not the

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:30.119 
Aslan himself around a bit you not the
first<00:02:27.560> piece<00:02:27.799> of<00:02:27.950> his<00:02:28.040> armor<00:02:28.310> off

he was backs and gets ready

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:35.679 
he was backs and gets ready
why<00:02:34.010> on<00:02:34.189> earth<00:02:34.219> you'll<00:02:34.579> fight<00:02:34.879> him<00:02:35.120> I<00:02:35.269> still

why on earth you'll fight him I still

00:02:35.689 --> 00:02:41.970 
why on earth you'll fight him I still
don't<00:02:35.959> know<00:02:36.109> he<00:02:36.560> should<00:02:36.829> be<00:02:36.980> helping<00:02:37.250> you

in<00:03:14.630> April<00:03:14.990> you<00:03:15.110> have<00:03:15.140> to<00:03:15.380> be<00:03:15.440> careful<00:03:15.830> with

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:15.890 
in April you have to be careful with

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:20.110 
in April you have to be careful with
axon<00:03:16.310> once<00:03:16.520> you<00:03:16.730> lose<00:03:16.940> hero<00:03:17.240> mode<00:03:18.970> and<00:03:19.970> you'll

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 
axon once you lose hero mode and you'll

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.480

see<00:03:20.330> how<00:03:20.569> in<00:03:20.750> a<00:03:20.810> bit

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:23.490 

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:27.970 

his<00:03:23.970> axon<00:03:24.540> I<00:03:24.900> once<00:03:25.770> had<00:03:25.950> about<00:03:26.160> four<00:03:26.730> hearts

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:27.980

his axon I once had about four hearts
these<00:03:28.980> are<00:03:29.190> the<00:03:29.250> silver<00:03:29.490> fully<00:03:29.910> upgraded

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 
these are the silver fully upgraded

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:33.620 
these are the silver fully upgraded
heart<00:03:30.630> and<00:03:30.990> I<00:03:31.050> think<00:03:31.110> in<00:03:31.350> a<00:03:31.410> single<00:03:31.800> blow<00:03:32.630> axon
