00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:21.710 
it's how it works on this one too and a

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.249 
it's how it works on this one too and a
little<00:01:22.710> bit<00:01:22.799> of<00:01:22.890> dirt<00:01:23.070> in<00:01:23.189> there<00:01:23.400> and<00:01:24.259> just

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
little bit of dirt in there and just

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:26.690 
little bit of dirt in there and just
because<00:01:25.500> this<00:01:25.590> thing<00:01:25.740> was<00:01:25.860> so<00:01:26.009> dirty<00:01:26.280> this<00:01:26.640> is

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
because this thing was so dirty this is

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.600 
because this thing was so dirty this is
a<00:01:26.880> coax<00:01:27.240> mounted<00:01:27.720> thing<00:01:27.990> so<00:01:28.290> the<00:01:28.950> driver<00:01:29.280> goes

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
a coax mounted thing so the driver goes

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.580 
a coax mounted thing so the driver goes
faces<00:01:30.180> through<00:01:30.390> here<00:01:30.689> and<00:01:30.840> there's<00:01:30.990> the<00:01:31.229> the

accumulated inside the voice coil
causing<00:01:40.560> issues<00:01:40.939> and<00:01:41.939> I<00:01:42.780> used<00:01:43.350> just<00:01:43.729> instead

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
causing issues and I used just instead

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:45.950 
causing issues and I used just instead
of<00:01:44.790> wood<00:01:45.000> glue<00:01:45.180> like<00:01:45.360> they<00:01:45.450> used<00:01:45.600> before<00:01:45.930> I

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
of wood glue like they used before I

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.359 
of wood glue like they used before I
used<00:01:46.259> some<00:01:46.950> clear<00:01:47.159> silicone<00:01:48.860> so<00:01:49.860> if<00:01:50.189> this

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
used some clear silicone so if this

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:51.800 
used some clear silicone so if this
thing<00:01:50.579> ever<00:01:50.670> fails<00:01:51.090> I<00:01:51.299> can<00:01:51.479> replace<00:01:51.750> it

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
thing ever fails I can replace it

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.870 
thing ever fails I can replace it
because<00:01:52.170> I<00:01:52.409> I<00:01:52.439> know<00:01:52.950> a<00:01:53.070> place<00:01:53.280> where<00:01:53.579> you<00:01:53.759> can

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
because I I know a place where you can

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.520 
because I I know a place where you can
get<00:01:54.060> other<00:01:54.210> speakers<00:01:54.720> like<00:01:54.899> this<00:01:55.140> that<00:01:55.380> will

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
get other speakers like this that will

had<00:02:29.870> something<00:02:30.230> done<00:02:30.680> to<00:02:30.920> it<00:02:30.950> I<00:02:31.160> don't<00:02:31.340> know

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:31.490 
had something done to it I don't know

what<00:02:31.670> this<00:02:31.880> is<00:02:31.940> about<00:02:32.210> but<00:02:32.570> it's<00:02:32.690> probably

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
what this is about but it's probably

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.530 
what this is about but it's probably
taken<00:02:33.260> apart<00:02:33.500> before<00:02:33.830> I<00:02:34.180> don't<00:02:35.180> know<00:02:35.390> what

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.150 
taken apart before I don't know what
that's<00:02:35.720> all<00:02:35.870> about<00:02:35.900> these<00:02:36.260> scratches<00:02:36.620> way<00:02:36.950> up

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 
that's all about these scratches way up

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:38.790 
that's all about these scratches way up
here<00:02:37.430> where<00:02:37.580> nothing<00:02:37.880> would<00:02:38.030> ever<00:02:38.180> hit<00:02:38.390> it

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:38.800 
here where nothing would ever hit it

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.200 
here where nothing would ever hit it
so<00:02:39.800> yeah<00:02:40.190> this<00:02:40.370> would<00:02:40.520> definitely<00:02:40.640> be<00:02:40.850> our

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:41.210 
so yeah this would definitely be our

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:42.970 
so yeah this would definitely be our
restoration<00:02:41.780> project<00:02:42.200> in<00:02:42.290> the<00:02:42.410> future<00:02:42.560> if<00:02:42.890> I

ever plan to use it anywhere else

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:47.350 
ever plan to use it anywhere else
besides<00:02:46.130> the<00:02:46.460> house<00:02:46.610> because<00:02:46.940> I<00:02:47.000> don't<00:02:47.180> look
