00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:10.740 
this shorter distance rowdy I think
characters<00:02:09.729> better<00:02:10.000> in<00:02:10.180> the<00:02:10.270> hundreds<00:02:10.630> o

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:31.220 
and that's what handsome did he

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:33.730 
and that's what handsome did he
maintained<00:03:32.000> that<00:03:32.030> great<00:03:32.540> temple<00:03:33.050> all<00:03:33.260> the<00:03:33.620> way

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:33.740 
maintained that great temple all the way

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:35.920 
maintained that great temple all the way
through<00:03:34.040> his<00:03:34.220> stroke<00:03:34.580> he's<00:03:35.090> got<00:03:35.120> great<00:03:35.660> legs

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:35.930 
through his stroke he's got great legs

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:38.200 
through his stroke he's got great legs
did<00:03:36.350> you<00:03:36.500> remember<00:03:36.680> you<00:03:36.920> said<00:03:37.190> he's<00:03:37.310> 15<00:03:37.790> pounds

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:38.210 
did you remember you said he's 15 pounds

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:39.940 
did you remember you said he's 15 pounds
lighter<00:03:38.390> he<00:03:38.570> rides<00:03:38.810> much<00:03:39.170> better<00:03:39.410> on<00:03:39.590> top<00:03:39.800> of

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:39.950 
lighter he rides much better on top of

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:41.950 
lighter he rides much better on top of
the<00:03:40.010> water<00:03:40.160> he's<00:03:40.640> got<00:03:40.910> that<00:03:41.090> great<00:03:41.450> extension

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:41.960 
the water he's got that great extension

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:44.110 
the water he's got that great extension
and<00:03:42.260> he<00:03:42.350> makes<00:03:42.620> so<00:03:42.890> much<00:03:43.160> out<00:03:43.400> of<00:03:43.430> the<00:03:43.610> kick<00:03:43.910> to

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:44.120 
and he makes so much out of the kick to

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.600 
and he makes so much out of the kick to
ride<00:03:44.420> that<00:03:44.450> extension<00:03:45.230> in<00:03:45.530> breaststroke<00:03:46.250> I

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:46.610 
ride that extension in breaststroke I

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:48.970 
ride that extension in breaststroke I
think<00:03:47.270> it's<00:03:47.450> the<00:03:47.510> most<00:03:47.750> critical<00:03:48.200> stroke<00:03:48.800> to

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:48.980 
think it's the most critical stroke to

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:50.680 
think it's the most critical stroke to
have<00:03:49.160> great<00:03:49.520> technique<00:03:50.090> but<00:03:50.330> once<00:03:50.510> again
