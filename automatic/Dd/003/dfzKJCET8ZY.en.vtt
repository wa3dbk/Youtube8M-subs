how long have you been involved well
it's<00:00:23.100> very<00:00:23.189> interesting<00:00:23.310> because<00:00:23.910> I<00:00:24.090> realized

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
it's very interesting because I realized

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.929 
it's very interesting because I realized
that<00:00:24.750> in<00:00:25.109> traditional<00:00:25.920> medicine<00:00:26.369> we<00:00:26.640> treat

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
that in traditional medicine we treat

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.900 
that in traditional medicine we treat
symptoms<00:00:27.449> and<00:00:27.630> not<00:00:27.750> disease<00:00:28.230> and<00:00:28.650> not<00:00:29.220> causes

symptoms and not disease and not causes

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.330 
symptoms and not disease and not causes
we<00:00:30.689> think<00:00:30.990> we're<00:00:31.170> doing<00:00:31.320> something<00:00:31.529> but<00:00:32.099> it<00:00:32.250> is

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
we think we're doing something but it is

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.970 
we think we're doing something but it is
the<00:00:32.489> basic<00:00:32.910> cause<00:00:33.210> that<00:00:34.020> is<00:00:34.230> the<00:00:34.469> root<00:00:34.710> of<00:00:34.890> the

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
the basic cause that is the root of the

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.549 
the basic cause that is the root of the
later<00:00:35.700> deficiencies<00:00:36.570> and<00:00:36.840> then<00:00:36.989> disorders

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
later deficiencies and then disorders

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.680 
later deficiencies and then disorders
that<00:00:37.770> we<00:00:37.920> see<00:00:38.129> the<00:00:38.700> eye<00:00:38.730> is<00:00:38.879> a<00:00:39.090> perfect<00:00:39.540> example

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
that we see the eye is a perfect example

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.160 
that we see the eye is a perfect example
it<00:00:40.649> has<00:00:40.829> a<00:00:40.860> high<00:00:41.190> metabolism<00:00:41.610> it<00:00:42.480> needs<00:00:42.780> lots

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
it has a high metabolism it needs lots

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.619 
it has a high metabolism it needs lots
of<00:00:43.410> good<00:00:44.040> nutritional<00:00:44.910> foods<00:00:45.239> and

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
of good nutritional foods and

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.500 
of good nutritional foods and
supplements<00:00:45.840> in<00:00:46.829> order<00:00:47.100> to<00:00:47.250> keep<00:00:47.430> going<00:00:47.700> and

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
supplements in order to keep going and

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.479 
supplements in order to keep going and
all<00:00:48.660> of<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:48.930> nutrition<00:00:49.500> is<00:00:49.680> in<00:00:49.829> the<00:00:49.950> liver<00:00:50.160> I

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
all of the nutrition is in the liver I

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.930 
all of the nutrition is in the liver I
took<00:00:51.030> several<00:00:51.239> courses<00:00:51.660> in<00:00:52.050> Graduate

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:52.940 
took several courses in Graduate

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.819 
took several courses in Graduate
biochemistry<00:00:53.940> and<00:00:54.149> nutrition<00:00:54.719> and<00:00:54.930> realized

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
biochemistry and nutrition and realized

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.630 
biochemistry and nutrition and realized
it's<00:00:56.370> so<00:00:56.670> important<00:00:57.360> to<00:00:57.629> feed<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:58.410> eye

00:00:58.630 --> 00:00:58.640 
it's so important to feed the eye

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.750 
it's so important to feed the eye
because<00:00:59.899> vision<00:01:00.899> is<00:01:01.079> mandatory<00:01:01.739> in<00:01:02.129> society

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
because vision is mandatory in society

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.020 
because vision is mandatory in society
today<00:01:03.110> 80%<00:01:04.110> of<00:01:04.199> what<00:01:04.320> we<00:01:04.379> do<00:01:04.769> is<00:01:05.040> visually

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
today 80% of what we do is visually

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.270 
today 80% of what we do is visually
oriented<00:01:06.390> and<00:01:06.780> people's<00:01:07.619> eyes<00:01:07.830> are<00:01:07.860> so

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
oriented and people's eyes are so

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.719 
oriented and people's eyes are so
necessary<00:01:08.549> at<00:01:09.330> the<00:01:09.510> same<00:01:09.780> time<00:01:10.400> sunshine<00:01:11.400> and

and<00:01:15.570> occupationally<00:01:16.439> available<00:01:17.280> are<00:01:17.610> things

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
and occupationally available are things

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.390 
and occupationally available are things
that<00:01:18.450> deteriorate<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:19.680> tissues<00:01:20.070> of<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.310> eye

that deteriorate the tissues of the eye
and<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:21.420> good<00:01:21.659> nutritional<00:01:22.290> support<00:01:22.560> is

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
and the good nutritional support is

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.429 
and the good nutritional support is
mandatory<00:01:23.549> and<00:01:24.360> you<00:01:24.479> talk<00:01:24.720> about<00:01:25.020> nutrition

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
mandatory and you talk about nutrition

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.230 
mandatory and you talk about nutrition
most<00:01:25.830> of<00:01:25.950> us<00:01:26.040> don't<00:01:26.159> think<00:01:26.280> about<00:01:26.490> feeding<00:01:27.090> the

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
most of us don't think about feeding the

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.260 
most of us don't think about feeding the
eye<00:01:27.390> as<00:01:27.750> you<00:01:27.930> say<00:01:28.170> that's<00:01:28.920> correct<00:01:29.280> I<00:01:29.579> mean<00:01:29.640> the

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
eye as you say that's correct I mean the

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.450 
eye as you say that's correct I mean the
retina<00:01:30.810> which<00:01:31.200> is<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:31.530> back<00:01:31.740> of<00:01:31.770> the<00:01:32.040> eye<00:01:32.070> let

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
retina which is the back of the eye let

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.249 
retina which is the back of the eye let
me<00:01:32.549> just<00:01:32.729> be<00:01:32.880> a<00:01:32.909> little<00:01:33.240> more<00:01:33.360> specific<00:01:33.630> okay

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
me just be a little more specific okay

look<00:01:38.610> at<00:01:38.729> an<00:01:38.850> eye<00:01:38.939> that<00:01:39.000> eyeball<00:01:39.540> is<00:01:39.750> basically

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
look at an eye that eyeball is basically

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:46.010

we'll discuss later like lutein are very

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.280 
we'll discuss later like lutein are very
important<00:03:00.340> in<00:03:00.520> the<00:03:00.790> rebound<00:03:01.300> from<00:03:01.630> glare<00:03:02.020> and

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
important in the rebound from glare and

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.590 
important in the rebound from glare and
the<00:03:02.620> protection<00:03:03.250> from<00:03:03.580> light<00:03:03.850> stress<00:03:04.240> on<00:03:04.480> the

the protection from light stress on the
retina<00:03:05.190> okay<00:03:06.190> and<00:03:06.490> so<00:03:07.240> there<00:03:07.450> are<00:03:07.480> nutrients

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:08.320 
retina okay and so there are nutrients

retina okay and so there are nutrients
that<00:03:08.440> we<00:03:08.560> can<00:03:08.740> take<00:03:08.950> to<00:03:09.130> feed<00:03:09.310> the<00:03:09.460> eye<00:03:09.490> besides

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
that we can take to feed the eye besides

well I think you begin always with your

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:17.460 
well I think you begin always with your
diet<00:03:15.820> because<00:03:16.120> you<00:03:16.450> make<00:03:16.660> a<00:03:16.690> choice<00:03:17.050> on<00:03:17.320> what

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470 
diet because you make a choice on what

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:19.600 
you put in it has to be absorbed go

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:21.600 
you put in it has to be absorbed go
through<00:03:19.810> your<00:03:19.990> liver<00:03:20.230> and<00:03:20.500> at<00:03:20.920> nighttime<00:03:21.160> when

through your liver and at nighttime when
you're<00:03:21.760> sleeping<00:03:22.240> there's<00:03:22.870> when<00:03:23.080> the

you're sleeping there's when the

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:25.199 
you're sleeping there's when the
nutrients<00:03:23.800> seep<00:03:24.160> out<00:03:24.370> into<00:03:24.430> the<00:03:24.940> remote

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:25.209 
nutrients seep out into the remote

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:27.810 
nutrients seep out into the remote
places<00:03:25.810> when<00:03:26.380> your<00:03:26.530> muscles<00:03:26.980> aren't<00:03:27.250> taking

places when your muscles aren't taking
up<00:03:27.970> all<00:03:28.150> the<00:03:28.180> energy<00:03:28.780> and<00:03:28.990> all<00:03:29.110> the<00:03:29.290> food<00:03:29.730> diet

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
up all the energy and all the food diet

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:33.390 
up all the energy and all the food diet
is<00:03:31.000> critical<00:03:31.570> but<00:03:32.350> we<00:03:32.380> don't<00:03:32.770> always<00:03:33.010> get

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
is critical but we don't always get

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.130 
is critical but we don't always get
enough<00:03:33.790> of<00:03:33.970> the<00:03:34.120> right<00:03:34.300> foods<00:03:34.690> in<00:03:34.990> our<00:03:35.080> diet

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:35.140 
enough of the right foods in our diet

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:38.280 
enough of the right foods in our diet
and<00:03:35.830> therefore<00:03:36.480> supplementation<00:03:37.480> I<00:03:37.720> feel<00:03:38.020> is

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:38.290 
and therefore supplementation I feel is

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:40.680 
and therefore supplementation I feel is
very<00:03:38.650> important<00:03:39.250> for<00:03:39.459> people<00:03:39.760> of<00:03:39.850> all<00:03:40.030> ages
