00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
myself haven't worn excuse we haven't

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:28.449 
myself haven't worn excuse we haven't
worn<00:02:26.990> our<00:02:27.080> knee<00:02:27.230> braces<00:02:27.620> in<00:02:27.740> a<00:02:27.800> while<00:02:27.980> so<00:02:28.280> my

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:28.459 
worn our knee braces in a while so my

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:30.550 
worn our knee braces in a while so my
knee<00:02:28.520> brace<00:02:28.820> tan<00:02:29.060> is<00:02:29.180> actually<00:02:29.630> going<00:02:30.350> away

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560

which is great my knees have been
feeling<00:02:32.450> awesome<00:02:32.690> I<00:02:33.700> think<00:02:34.700> that<00:02:35.150> might<00:02:35.239> be

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:35.300 
feeling awesome I think that might be

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.570 
feeling awesome I think that might be
because<00:02:35.590> the<00:02:36.590> terrain<00:02:36.800> is<00:02:37.130> kind<00:02:37.370> of<00:02:37.459> evening

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:37.580 
because the terrain is kind of evening

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:39.190 
because the terrain is kind of evening
out<00:02:37.910> so<00:02:38.150> it's<00:02:38.300> not<00:02:38.420> as<00:02:38.570> much<00:02:38.690> pounding

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
out so it's not as much pounding

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.350 
out so it's not as much pounding
downhill<00:02:39.650> so<00:02:39.920> I<00:02:39.950> haven't<00:02:40.370> really<00:02:40.610> felt<00:02:41.209> the

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 
downhill so I haven't really felt the

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:42.910 
downhill so I haven't really felt the
need<00:02:41.510> to<00:02:41.720> wear<00:02:41.900> it<00:02:41.930> which<00:02:42.260> is<00:02:42.410> good<00:02:42.680> so

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
need to wear it which is good so

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.410 
need to wear it which is good so
hopefully<00:02:43.070> that<00:02:43.400> continues<00:02:43.520> so<00:02:44.030> I<00:02:44.060> can<00:02:44.239> build

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
hopefully that continues so I can build

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:46.630 
hopefully that continues so I can build
up<00:02:44.570> you<00:02:45.440> know<00:02:45.560> a<00:02:45.590> lot<00:02:45.709> of<00:02:45.830> strength<00:02:46.250> so<00:02:46.489> when<00:02:46.610> I
