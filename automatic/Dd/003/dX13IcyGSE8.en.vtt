00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:11.550
 Hello everyone, Time is in Brazil. 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.110
 beginning and the cold front that still acts 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.670
 over the Southeast maintains the sky with 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.710
 cloudiness in the region 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.420
 other areas of instability 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.700
 were growing over the southern region 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.500
 leaving the sky also cloudy and 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:23.880
 conditions and during the end of 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.919

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.869

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:29.220
 rio de janeiro although the cold front already 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.599
 begins to move away 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.640

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.239
