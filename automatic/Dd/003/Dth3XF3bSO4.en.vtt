 Hi, I'm Ikumi Nakamura, concept artist for Tango Gameworks. 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.656
 How are you preparing to create monsters? 

00:00:32.656 --> 00:00:34.410
 No need. 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.996
 Really. I am always ready to immerse myself in the monstrous. 

00:00:39.996 --> 00:00:42.835
 Do you have nightmares? 

00:00:44.045 --> 00:00:47.005
 This is my first time working with Mikami, 

00:00:47.005 --> 00:00:52.095
 but since we started, I'm actually having a lot of nightmares. 

00:00:52.135 --> 00:00:55.640
 I do not dream that Mikami is shouting at me, 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:00.060
 but rather that I come to work and find him dead, 

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:09.526
 or that he is waiting for me sitting with a white bag on his head. 

00:01:09.526 --> 00:01:15.116
 These are horrible images that turn the stomach. 

00:01:15.616 --> 00:01:17.576
 Have you always drawn monsters? 

00:01:17.576 --> 00:01:20.415
 No. This is my first time [for concept art]. 

00:01:20.996 --> 00:01:23.331
 Until now, I was working on environments. 

00:01:23.331 --> 00:01:29.005
 So I start with characters and monsters. 

00:01:29.296 --> 00:01:32.260
 What is the strangest illustration that you have been asked for? 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:34.676
 A curious request? 

00:01:36.636 --> 00:01:38.640
 Even other employers? 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:45.065
 In Japan, adventures for girls are often drawn in "moe" style. 

00:01:45.065 --> 00:01:50.401
 I can not draw like that, but I was asked once. 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:58.035
 It's really difficult for an illustrator to make such images. 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:04.875
 I like realism, but here you have to make pink hair and big eyes, 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.920
 and a little voice that's mincing.
