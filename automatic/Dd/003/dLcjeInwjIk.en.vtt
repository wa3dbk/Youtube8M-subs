have<00:01:45.960> been<00:01:45.990> five<00:01:46.799> and<00:01:47.130> six<00:01:47.520> which<00:01:48.270> you<00:01:48.329> can<00:01:48.420> see

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
have been five and six which you can see

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.899 
have been five and six which you can see
at<00:01:48.659> the<00:01:48.720> bottom<00:01:48.840> there<00:01:49.229> and<00:01:49.520> the<00:01:50.520> reason<00:01:50.670> why

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
at the bottom there and the reason why

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.580 
at the bottom there and the reason why
this<00:01:50.970> works<00:01:51.299> so<00:01:51.420> well<00:01:51.509> is<00:01:51.750> having<00:01:51.990> a<00:01:52.049> 60<00:01:52.470> degree

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
this works so well is having a 60 degree

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.700 
this works so well is having a 60 degree
angle<00:01:52.829> up<00:01:53.399> front<00:01:53.790> works<00:01:54.509> perfect<00:01:55.110> it<00:01:55.259> gives

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
angle up front works perfect it gives

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.120 
angle up front works perfect it gives
you<00:01:55.799> the<00:01:55.890> balance<00:01:56.219> of<00:01:57.649> pinpointing<00:01:58.649> people

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
you the balance of pinpointing people

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.179 
you the balance of pinpointing people
with<00:01:59.969> a<00:02:00.000> much<00:02:00.299> I<00:02:00.630> don't<00:02:01.140> know<00:02:01.290> well<00:02:01.649> higher

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
with a much I don't know well higher

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.580 
with a much I don't know well higher
degree<00:02:02.520> of<00:02:02.610> accuracy<00:02:02.820> like<00:02:03.210> if<00:02:04.079> you<00:02:04.200> see<00:02:04.380> their

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
degree of accuracy like if you see their

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.399 
degree of accuracy like if you see their
number<00:02:04.920> two<00:02:05.159> and<00:02:05.340> three<00:02:06.000> they<00:02:06.329> have<00:02:06.659> a<00:02:06.930> 45

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
number two and three they have a 45

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.499 
number two and three they have a 45
degree<00:02:07.710> angle<00:02:07.920> now<00:02:08.369> I<00:02:08.670> thought<00:02:09.239> this<00:02:09.360> would<00:02:09.479> be

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
degree angle now I thought this would be

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:10.910 
degree angle now I thought this would be
bear<00:02:09.780> and<00:02:10.020> some<00:02:10.170> people<00:02:10.379> said<00:02:10.560> it's<00:02:10.679> better

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
bear and some people said it's better

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.440 
bear and some people said it's better
online<00:02:11.160> about

more<00:02:12.720> precise<00:02:13.110> upfront<00:02:13.590> but<00:02:14.280> what<00:02:14.490> I've<00:02:14.970> been

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
more precise upfront but what I've been

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.090 
more precise upfront but what I've been
getting<00:02:15.480> quite<00:02:15.930> confused<00:02:16.560> with<00:02:16.740> that<00:02:16.860> saying

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
getting quite confused with that saying

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.010 
getting quite confused with that saying
it<00:02:17.340> sounds<00:02:18.180> like<00:02:18.270> they're<00:02:18.390> in<00:02:18.480> front<00:02:18.690> of<00:02:18.840> you

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
it sounds like they're in front of you

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.840 
it sounds like they're in front of you
when<00:02:19.770> the<00:02:19.890> more<00:02:20.100> to<00:02:20.250> the<00:02:20.340> left<00:02:20.550> and<00:02:20.730> to<00:02:20.819> the

when the more to the left and to the

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
right side be looking forward thinking

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:23.240 
right side be looking forward thinking
they're<00:02:22.560> going<00:02:22.650> to<00:02:22.709> come<00:02:22.830> through<00:02:22.950> the<00:02:23.069> door

and it turns out too much further to the

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990 
those stands and I just I was getting

number<00:02:40.650> 5<00:02:40.890> &amp;<00:02:41.130> 6<00:02:41.280> is<00:02:41.459> great<00:02:41.700> now<00:02:41.819> I'm<00:02:41.940> trying<00:02:42.150> to

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
number 5 &amp; 6 is great now I'm trying to

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.180 
number 5 &amp; 6 is great now I'm trying to
work<00:02:42.330> out<00:02:42.540> which<00:02:42.690> I<00:02:42.840> like<00:02:42.959> the<00:02:43.110> most<00:02:43.380> I<00:02:43.650> think

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
work out which I like the most I think

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:47.180 
work out which I like the most I think
at<00:02:44.459> the<00:02:44.610> minute<00:02:44.880> I'm<00:02:45.030> more<00:02:45.750> favoring<00:02:46.709> number<00:02:46.920> 5

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
at the minute I'm more favoring number 5

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.640 
at the minute I'm more favoring number 5
because<00:02:47.430> the<00:02:47.760> 150<00:02:48.480> degree<00:02:49.080> angle<00:02:49.380> as<00:02:49.440> you<00:02:49.530> can

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
because the 150 degree angle as you can

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:50.330 
because the 150 degree angle as you can
see<00:02:49.800> on<00:02:49.920> six

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
see on six

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.520 
see on six
it<00:02:50.459> is<00:02:51.209> a<00:02:51.239> bit<00:02:51.480> too<00:02:51.690> broad<00:02:52.080> you<00:02:52.110> can<00:02:52.440> be

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
it is a bit too broad you can be

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.290 
it is a bit too broad you can be
basically<00:02:52.950> I<00:02:53.070> know<00:02:53.459> you<00:02:53.550> turn<00:02:53.850> around<00:02:54.150> when

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
basically I know you turn around when

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:55.520 
basically I know you turn around when
you<00:02:54.360> hear<00:02:54.480> a<00:02:54.510> noise<00:02:54.660> behind<00:02:54.900> you<00:02:55.200> but<00:02:55.350> say<00:02:55.500> for

it's<00:03:07.410> just<00:03:07.560> a<00:03:07.769> little<00:03:07.950> bit<00:03:08.190> too<00:03:08.400> broad<00:03:08.700> on<00:03:08.940> the

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
it's just a little bit too broad on the

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.259 
it's just a little bit too broad on the
back<00:03:09.300> but<00:03:09.510> there<00:03:09.630> is<00:03:09.750> the<00:03:10.260> more<00:03:10.680> open<00:03:11.190> Maps<00:03:11.430> my

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:12.269 
back but there is the more open Maps my

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:13.670 
back but there is the more open Maps my
overlord<00:03:12.840> or<00:03:13.080> something<00:03:13.440> where<00:03:13.560> you're

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
overlord or something where you're

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.580

outside<00:03:14.239> it<00:03:15.239> does<00:03:15.480> tend<00:03:15.660> to<00:03:15.750> works<00:03:15.930> off<00:03:16.110> I<00:03:16.320> tend

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
outside it does tend to works off I tend

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.380 
outside it does tend to works off I tend
to<00:03:16.650> flip<00:03:16.890> between<00:03:17.070> five<00:03:17.519> and<00:03:17.549> six<00:03:17.970> now<00:03:18.209> that's

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390 
to flip between five and six now that's

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:20.990 
to flip between five and six now that's
just<00:03:18.890> tapping<00:03:19.890> the<00:03:20.070> bottom<00:03:20.340> on<00:03:20.430> on<00:03:20.670> the<00:03:20.820> side

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
just tapping the bottom on on the side

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.120 
just tapping the bottom on on the side
of<00:03:21.120> the<00:03:21.180> wireless<00:03:21.360> dongle<00:03:21.690> what<00:03:22.140> the<00:03:22.290> dongle

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
of the wireless dongle what the dongle

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:24.729 
of the wireless dongle what the dongle
camera<00:03:23.430> it's<00:03:23.549> called<00:03:23.730> the<00:03:23.880> world<00:03:24.030> box<00:03:24.299> them

00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:24.739 
camera it's called the world box them

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:27.650 
camera it's called the world box them
that<00:03:25.739> sits<00:03:25.920> on<00:03:26.040> top<00:03:26.130> of<00:03:26.190> the<00:03:26.310> ps4<00:03:26.790> so<00:03:27.450> you<00:03:27.540> just

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
that sits on top of the ps4 so you just

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.630 
that sits on top of the ps4 so you just
flick<00:03:27.870> between<00:03:27.959> those<00:03:28.650> two<00:03:28.890> but<00:03:29.070> majority<00:03:29.340> the

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
flick between those two but majority the

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.420 
flick between those two but majority the
time<00:03:29.820> I<00:03:29.850> have<00:03:30.090> been<00:03:30.239> playing<00:03:31.250> using<00:03:32.250> number

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
time I have been playing using number

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:35.900 
time I have been playing using number
five<00:03:32.700> also<00:03:33.570> the<00:03:34.260> far<00:03:34.620> more<00:03:34.860> sports<00:03:35.370> games<00:03:35.730> I

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
five also the far more sports games I

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:38.479 
five also the far more sports games I
found<00:03:36.180> that<00:03:36.560> number<00:03:37.560> four<00:03:37.829> work<00:03:38.040> so<00:03:38.190> well<00:03:38.400> it

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:38.489 
found that number four work so well it

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:41.420 
found that number four work so well it
kind<00:03:38.640> of<00:03:38.700> gives<00:03:38.850> you<00:03:38.910> an<00:03:39.030> urn<00:03:39.239> a<00:03:39.269> full<00:03:40.430> balance

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
kind of gives you an urn a full balance

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:43.009 
kind of gives you an urn a full balance
around<00:03:41.670> sound<00:03:42.150> biking<00:03:42.570> if<00:03:42.660> the<00:03:42.780> crowd

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510

and six of them angles I'm not sure

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.729 
and six of them angles I'm not sure
which<00:03:57.390> I<00:03:57.570> can<00:03:57.750> find<00:03:57.780> an<00:03:58.079> angle<00:03:58.200> for<00:03:58.560> number

worn<00:03:58.950> it<00:03:59.070> just<00:03:59.220> looks<00:03:59.400> like<00:03:59.750> horrendous

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:00.750 
worn it just looks like horrendous

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:03.620 
worn it just looks like horrendous
8-inch<00:04:01.019> 30<00:04:01.290> degrees<00:04:01.530> at<00:04:01.650> 405<00:04:02.370> out<00:04:02.579> wide<00:04:02.790> not

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
sure what that's even for if anybody

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.340 
sure what that's even for if anybody
uses<00:04:05.489> that<00:04:05.730> same<00:04:05.940> let<00:04:06.120> me<00:04:06.209> know<00:04:06.329> if<00:04:06.450> it's<00:04:06.600> what

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:07.350 
uses that same let me know if it's what

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:09.530 
uses that same let me know if it's what
you're<00:04:07.470> using<00:04:07.650> it<00:04:07.799> for<00:04:07.880> and<00:04:08.880> so<00:04:09.269> that<00:04:09.390> covers

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540 
you're using it for and so that covers

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.420 
you're using it for and so that covers
the<00:04:09.720> sound<00:04:09.930> angles<00:04:10.290> front<00:04:10.530> for<00:04:10.739> me<00:04:10.859> but<00:04:11.220> five

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430 
the sound angles front for me but five

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:13.069 
the sound angles front for me but five
and<00:04:11.640> six<00:04:11.850> have<00:04:12.000> been<00:04:12.030> the<00:04:12.239> best<00:04:12.420> so<00:04:12.570> far<00:04:12.600> the

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:13.079 
and six have been the best so far the

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:18.050 
and six have been the best so far the
next<00:04:13.230> part<00:04:13.560> is<00:04:13.829> the<00:04:15.709> equalizer<00:04:16.709> and<00:04:17.160> basically

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.060 
next part is the equalizer and basically

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:20.000 
next part is the equalizer and basically
this<00:04:18.239> gives<00:04:18.450> you<00:04:18.539> a<00:04:18.570> number<00:04:18.720> one<00:04:19.019> flat<00:04:19.769> like

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.010 
this gives you a number one flat like

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:21.289 
this gives you a number one flat like
it's<00:04:20.190> supposed<00:04:20.489> to<00:04:20.609> come<00:04:20.729> out<00:04:20.760> the<00:04:20.910> factory

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:21.299 
it's supposed to come out the factory

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:22.580 
it's supposed to come out the factory
that's<00:04:21.419> why<00:04:21.539> it<00:04:21.599> supposed<00:04:21.810> to<00:04:21.840> sound<00:04:21.989> like<00:04:22.080> to

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:22.590 
that's why it supposed to sound like to

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:24.380 
that's why it supposed to sound like to
is<00:04:22.740> a<00:04:22.770> bass<00:04:23.010> boost<00:04:23.280> three<00:04:23.729> is<00:04:23.789> a<00:04:23.880> treble<00:04:24.180> boost

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:24.390 
is a bass boost three is a treble boost

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:26.450 
is a bass boost three is a treble boost
and<00:04:24.630> four<00:04:25.260> is<00:04:25.410> base<00:04:25.650> on

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460 
and four is base on

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:28.520 
and four is base on
now<00:04:26.760> it's<00:04:26.910> pretty<00:04:27.120> self-explanatory<00:04:27.930> but

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:28.530 
now it's pretty self-explanatory but

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:30.620 
now it's pretty self-explanatory but
just<00:04:29.040> cover<00:04:29.250> what<00:04:29.520> sends<00:04:29.970> out<00:04:30.150> to<00:04:30.330> have<00:04:30.420> it<00:04:30.540> on

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:30.630 
just cover what sends out to have it on

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:32.360 
just cover what sends out to have it on
for<00:04:30.870> this<00:04:30.960> for<00:04:31.200> plain<00:04:31.290> collar<00:04:31.590> do<00:04:31.830> it<00:04:32.010> always

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:32.370 
for this for plain collar do it always

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:35.930 
for this for plain collar do it always
number<00:04:33.030> three<00:04:34.130> it<00:04:35.130> kind<00:04:35.340> of<00:04:35.400> reduces<00:04:35.520> the

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:35.940 
number three it kind of reduces the

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:39.860 
number three it kind of reduces the
boost<00:04:36.210> boost<00:04:37.140> base<00:04:37.730> but<00:04:38.730> really<00:04:39.330> amplifies

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:39.870 
boost boost base but really amplifies

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:41.360 
boost boost base but really amplifies

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:09.960 
number I kind of 90 times that template

number I kind of 90 times that template
on<00:06:10.520> number<00:06:11.520> four<00:06:11.820> if<00:06:12.540> I'm<00:06:12.720> playing<00:06:12.870> on<00:06:13.050> a<00:06:13.110> map

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:13.290 
on number four if I'm playing on a map

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:15.650 
on number four if I'm playing on a map
where<00:06:13.560> it<00:06:14.040> for<00:06:14.700> example<00:06:15.030> has<00:06:15.150> a<00:06:15.180> lot<00:06:15.270> of<00:06:15.390> wood

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:15.660 
where it for example has a lot of wood

where it for example has a lot of wood
on<00:06:15.810> the<00:06:15.930> floor<00:06:16.200> all<00:06:16.500> our<00:06:16.860> steps<00:06:17.190> like<00:06:17.580> I<00:06:17.700> think

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:17.880 
on the floor all our steps like I think

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:20.210 
on the floor all our steps like I think
four<00:06:18.210> did<00:06:18.390> I<00:06:18.570> put<00:06:19.080> onto<00:06:19.230> number<00:06:19.440> three<00:06:19.920> just<00:06:20.100> to

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:20.220 
four did I put onto number three just to

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:23.270 
four did I put onto number three just to
the<00:06:20.340> fact<00:06:20.580> that<00:06:20.700> the<00:06:21.360> footsteps<00:06:21.990> sound<00:06:22.920> better

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:23.280 
the fact that the footsteps sound better

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:25.850 
the fact that the footsteps sound better
and<00:06:23.460> it<00:06:23.880> went<00:06:24.450> basically<00:06:24.600> running<00:06:25.290> on<00:06:25.440> what<00:06:25.710> it
