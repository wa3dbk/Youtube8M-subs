00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:14.419
 revolutionary but you look at it 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:16.070
 hood ominous hello everyone with you 

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:18.410
 Game Review Channel 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:20.480
 I want to playtation for review today 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:22.700
 share your opinion on the new part 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:25.280
 assassin's creed called unity 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:26.660
 The game was released in October 2014 from 

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:29.510
 ubisoft montreal companies 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:31.070
 even on e3, the developers assured us that 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:33.230
 this is a brand new assassin 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:36.200
 new both in history and in technical 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:38.420
 This plan turned out to be true about the end 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:41.270
 did the game engine finally redone in 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:43.280
 the game building scale 1 to 1 and finally 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:44.930
 there is a nice detail with 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.300
 good character animation 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:49.250
 the game action takes place in one of the most 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.850
 cruel and bloody in history 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:54.050
 periods the times of the french revolution 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:56.090
 the developers did very well 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:58.579
 to convey the atmosphere of Paris at that time 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:01.250
 crazy people who are looking for someone else 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:03.380
 kill a sea of ​​blood of dirt and ashes from 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:06.079
 burning everything we can 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:08.299
 play arnaud son assassin when you 

00:01:06.079 --> 00:01:10.340
 his father was killed and or knew brought up 

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:13.219
 high-ranking family 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:16.280
 gordini templar and his stepfather head 

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:19.459
 the templar need to be nothing especially 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:21.439
 Now in the course of the plot we will meet 

00:01:19.459 --> 00:01:23.179
 Satisfied with famous personalities such as 

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:25.459
 young napoleon bonaparte 

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:27.709
 Marquis de Sade should be noted that even in 

00:01:25.459 --> 00:01:30.679
 side missions can be found for example 

00:01:27.709 --> 00:01:32.740
 Madame Tussauds generally playing in unity first 

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:35.389
 watch you just want to run around the city and 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:36.709
 consider all its beauty and very 

00:01:35.389 --> 00:01:38.990
 tightly hooked on historical facts 

00:01:36.709 --> 00:01:41.840
 which can be read about various places 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:43.939
 buildings people much more all this 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.950
 diluted with humor from developers 

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:47.959
 that was not very boring in the game 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.609
 slightly changed the mechanics now to 

00:01:47.959 --> 00:01:52.249
 climb on the building will leave more 

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:54.020
 time is all due to the scale of one to 

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:54.859
 to one about which I mentioned 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.679
 the beginning of the review 

00:01:54.859 --> 00:02:00.409
 the building is now huge beautiful what with 

00:01:57.679 --> 00:02:02.509
 I want them to look awesome 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:04.399
 synchronize all points on the map 

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:05.990
 visually the game is very good all 

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:08.539
 worked out to the smallest detail 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:09.170
 of course this is not cj rollers new call 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:11.629
 of duty 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.460
 but the videos in the assassin are not cj on 

00:02:11.629 --> 00:02:16.100
 game engine 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:18.260
 the world in revolutionary paris is very much alive 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:21.050
 yubisoft did a good job on watch 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:23.330
 dog themselves with the study of the game world and in 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:25.520
 unity it looks even better on everyone 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:27.680
 step people do something somewhere goes 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:30.500
 penalty summer chanting slogans and harness 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:33.470
 fires someone distributes newspapers and someone 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:35.180
 sings songs all have unique animation 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:37.640
 it can be seen that the developers have a lot of time 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:39.500
 killed but such additional elements in 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.720
 the game as in other parts there are 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.580
 mini puzzles you run her see that by 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.800
 road appear to some people and 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:47.180
 Of course, I offer to help them earlier. 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:48.890
 This is not particularly engaged 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:51.440
 for it took a lot of time 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:53.000
 especially if one gets involved in a fight but 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.250
 blame it all happens so much 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.530
 fast and the main thing is that on the way 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.630
 you pass all the quick tasks for 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:02.080
 which give certain bonuses in general 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:04.670
 saying wallpaper it has become at times effects and 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:05.780
 more interesting but harder to kill you now 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:07.790
 much easier 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:10.010
 from two hits from a gun at once and 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:12.830
 so you like in battle you must either skillfully 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:15.680
 use the skills of counter rolling 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:16.820
 either run if there are many enemies in this 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:19.070
 parts feel really 

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:19.610
 assassin to honor from someone you run away to 

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:21.740
 the roof 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:24.350
 then most likely he will not climb for you 

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:26.510
 as you used to be an assassin and still the whole 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:29.120
 the city with you it imposes 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:31.760
 its mark on the game and was hiding 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:34.070
 more difficult and not interesting should be noted 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:36.080
 what's in the game and this is probably the first game with 

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:37.970
 open and so developed world 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:40.070
 where a lot of people 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:41.990
 really when you make your way through the crowd 

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:44.180
 people feeling house in town 

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:46.130
 felt even stronger than me as well 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:48.920
 pleased that the game is paid little 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:50.900
 the present tense namely abstergo 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:52.820
 and how we ended up in this time 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:55.070
 honestly i never had it 

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:57.320
 interesting I always had fun 

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:59.540
 play in the historical era that 

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:01.400
 we were provided by the developers but 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:03.560
 completely part of the real not cut out 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:05.510
 just said that Abstergo created 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:07.100
 helix is a gaming type 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:09.320
 prefix with which we can 

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:11.750
 relive part of the story from the video in my 

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:13.910
 couch and periodically throws us over 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:15.800
 the time interval or rather faults 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:17.390
 then we find ourselves in paris at 

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:19.880
 construction of the statue of liberty 

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:21.590
 then during the second world war I think 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:23.870
 you will also be interested to run there 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:25.400
 Generally speaking about additional issue 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:26.250
 some might even say 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:28.430
 more interesting with 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:31.170
 Aries have a new type of mission called 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:33.600
 the investigation very much reminded me of the whole 

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:35.610
 number we have to find evidence and 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:37.410
 determine who committed the crime 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:39.810
 also in the game there are nostradamus puzzles 

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:42.150
 here you will need to know at least a little 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:44.430
 history of paris and and architecture 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:46.950
 very many other missions where we also 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:49.470
 will meet interesting characters in 

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:51.420
 beat the game leveling your character can not 

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:53.220
 say that it is very diverse but 

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:55.290
 some skills that used to be in the game 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:57.990
 were given in fact now you need to download 

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:59.970
 weapons of clothing are more than enough with 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:02.790
 In time you will still be able to buy on tutu 

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:04.919
 play money and donat which made 

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:07.200
 developers are more likely for those who want 

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:10.140
 get it all at once so by this 

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:12.030
 I wouldn't worry too much about not 

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:14.280
 had money problems advise immediately 

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:16.230
 pump cafe theaters and only manages 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:18.419
 collect money from him with another chip 

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:20.580
 games became cooperative support up 

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:22.500
 four players in the game have missions 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:24.750
 which can be held 200 with friends 

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:26.970
 or do random players need to talk 

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:29.160
 that it adds even more fun when 

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:31.500
 the game when you eat four chop 

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:33.090
 guards left and right for those who 

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:34.140
 likes to collect chests here you have to 

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:36.300
 to work hard 

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:38.370
 not all chests open just like that 

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:40.610
 some need to be hacked and for that 

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:43.050
 need for points to buy the skill 

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:44.910
 some chests open after 

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:47.250
 how do you do a certain task in 

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:49.680
 mobile application companion a few words 

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:51.930
 o application it can be used as 

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:54.510
 an extra card is very beautiful 

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:56.010
 It is also convenient to notice when you have collected 

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:58.229
 game historical information can be 

00:05:56.010 --> 00:06:00.870
 read on the go through the app 

00:05:58.229 --> 00:06:02.820
 well, and also here you can download assassins 

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:05.040
 send them to tasks get paid for it 

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:06.630
 bonuses open certain chests in 

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:08.010
 the main game what have we come to 

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:10.380
 the moment about which I do not really like 

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:12.570
 speak but then I will not be honest before 

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:15.150
 the audience what it would be and heights 

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:16.380
 no bugs and problems can be seen immediately that the game 

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:18.840
 created a rush 

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:21.660
 it's all a desire to release the game quickly 

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:23.400
 and annual and then everything close the patch 

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:26.160
 Well, at least I tried to do it 

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:28.830
 in the game at certain moments strongly 

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:31.169
 suffers fps people happen to fail in 

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:33.300
 textures on the internet are already a bunch of vidos with 

00:06:31.169 --> 00:06:35.340
 by the gods and looking at what partner in 

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:37.050
 the game has changed a bit now there 

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:39.689
 separate combination of descent and ascent 

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:41.519
 anyway sometimes the hero tupit and tugging 

00:06:39.689 --> 00:06:44.009
 you are not where you want but sometimes it happens 

00:06:41.519 --> 00:06:45.809
 jump high-rise palace call to these 

00:06:44.009 --> 00:06:47.129
 moments in principle you get used to and through 

00:06:45.809 --> 00:06:49.499
 some time they do not deliver 

00:06:47.129 --> 00:06:51.479
 inconvenience bugs grow at home in 

00:06:49.499 --> 00:06:53.129
 nearest patches corrected for example 

00:06:51.479 --> 00:06:55.169
 last patch most problems already 

00:06:53.129 --> 00:06:57.509

 and the story is not the plot part but in 

00:07:02.189 --> 00:07:06.989
 In general, the whole game is very interesting 

00:07:04.529 --> 00:07:09.029
 new for some gameplay chips

 call the new developers did not have enough 

00:07:15.959 --> 00:07:19.469
 a little time to optimize and be 

00:07:18.029 --> 00:07:22.199
 maybe on the main story 

00:07:19.469 --> 00:07:24.539
