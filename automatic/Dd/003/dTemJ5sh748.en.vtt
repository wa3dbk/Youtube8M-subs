this some these sorts of cases do they

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:22.950 
this some these sorts of cases do they
affect<00:02:21.579> screen

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:22.960 
affect screen

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:24.960

covers or screen protectors and as you
can<00:02:25.090> see<00:02:25.120> on<00:02:25.330> this<00:02:25.480> edge<00:02:25.750> if<00:02:26.320> i<00:02:26.440> push<00:02:26.740> against

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
can see on this edge if i push against

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:29.280 
can see on this edge if i push against
the<00:02:27.250> case<00:02:27.520> it<00:02:27.730> does<00:02:28.030> lift<00:02:28.450> that<00:02:28.630> screen<00:02:29.020> cover

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
the case it does lift that screen cover

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:32.250 
the case it does lift that screen cover
up<00:02:29.500> so<00:02:30.460> but<00:02:30.760> with<00:02:30.910> a<00:02:30.940> bit<00:02:31.120> of<00:02:31.180> manipulation<00:02:31.630> i

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
up so but with a bit of manipulation i

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.780 
up so but with a bit of manipulation i
think<00:02:33.190> you<00:02:33.580> can<00:02:33.730> get<00:02:34.090> the<00:02:34.990> case<00:02:35.230> to<00:02:35.530> come

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
think you can get the case to come

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.430 
think you can get the case to come
probably<00:02:36.790> above<00:02:37.120> the<00:02:37.390> screen<00:02:37.630> cover<00:02:38.050> so<00:02:38.350> it's

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
probably above the screen cover so it's

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:39.780 
probably above the screen cover so it's
probably<00:02:38.830> something<00:02:39.130> that<00:02:39.250> just<00:02:39.520> needs<00:02:39.730> a

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
probably something that just needs a

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:42.710 
probably something that just needs a
little<00:02:39.820> bit<00:02:40.090> of<00:02:40.150> manipulation<00:02:41.070> it<00:02:42.070> also

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
little bit of manipulation it also

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.180 
little bit of manipulation it also
protrudes<00:02:43.720> from<00:02:44.020> the<00:02:44.500> top<00:02:44.710> of<00:02:44.830> the<00:02:44.920> screen

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
protrudes from the top of the screen

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:48.900 
protrudes from the top of the screen
very<00:02:45.730> slightly<00:02:46.680> probably<00:02:47.680> only<00:02:47.950> about<00:02:48.250> maybe

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
very slightly probably only about maybe

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:51.420 
very slightly probably only about maybe
a<00:02:49.030> millimeter<00:02:49.360> of<00:02:50.070> protrusion<00:02:51.070> so<00:02:51.280> if<00:02:51.340> you

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
a millimeter of protrusion so if you

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.150 
a millimeter of protrusion so if you
place<00:02:51.640> your<00:02:51.820> iphone<00:02:52.300> on<00:02:52.510> a<00:02:53.230> table<00:02:53.920> or<00:02:54.040> a<00:02:54.100> desk

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
place your iphone on a table or a desk

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.810 
place your iphone on a table or a desk
or<00:02:55.090> face<00:02:55.420> down<00:02:55.750> the<00:02:56.530> screen<00:02:56.950> isn't<00:02:57.190> physically

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:57.820 
or face down the screen isn't physically

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:59.340 
or face down the screen isn't physically
going<00:02:57.940> to<00:02:58.060> touch<00:02:58.210> the<00:02:58.390> surface<00:02:58.600> that's<00:02:59.110> nice

00:02:59.340 --> 00:02:59.350 
going to touch the surface that's nice

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:01.200 
going to touch the surface that's nice
it<00:02:59.650> doesn't<00:02:59.920> protrude<00:03:00.130> us<00:03:00.370> as<00:03:00.580> much<00:03:00.880> as<00:03:00.910> some

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:01.210 
it doesn't protrude us as much as some

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:04.190 
it doesn't protrude us as much as some
cases<00:03:01.720> but<00:03:01.930> this<00:03:02.440> is<00:03:02.590> a<00:03:02.620> lot<00:03:03.100> slimmer<00:03:03.460> profile

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
cases but this is a lot slimmer profile

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.020 
cases but this is a lot slimmer profile
protection<00:03:05.200> wise<00:03:05.380> the<00:03:05.950> rubbers<00:03:06.340> nice<00:03:06.760> and

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 
protection wise the rubbers nice and

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:09.510 
protection wise the rubbers nice and
flexible<00:03:07.420> though<00:03:07.750> quite<00:03:08.050> rigid<00:03:08.320> and<00:03:08.680> if<00:03:09.400> you

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:09.520 
flexible though quite rigid and if you

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:11.700 
flexible though quite rigid and if you
dropped<00:03:09.820> it<00:03:09.970> on<00:03:10.090> a<00:03:10.120> desk<00:03:10.420> or<00:03:11.110> on<00:03:11.170> the<00:03:11.530> floor

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:11.710 
dropped it on a desk or on the floor

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:13.500 
dropped it on a desk or on the floor
then<00:03:12.130> at<00:03:12.310> least<00:03:12.460> the<00:03:12.670> case<00:03:12.880> is<00:03:13.060> going<00:03:13.210> to<00:03:13.300> take

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510 
then at least the case is going to take

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:16.710 
then at least the case is going to take
most<00:03:13.960> of<00:03:14.260> the<00:03:14.610> drop<00:03:15.610> or<00:03:15.910> the<00:03:16.090> force<00:03:16.390> of<00:03:16.600> the

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720 
most of the drop or the force of the

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:18.990 
most of the drop or the force of the
drop<00:03:16.960> so<00:03:17.560> should<00:03:17.740> offer<00:03:17.890> up<00:03:18.070> a<00:03:18.100> decent<00:03:18.520> amount

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 
drop so should offer up a decent amount

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.810 
drop so should offer up a decent amount
of<00:03:19.090> protection<00:03:19.680> now<00:03:20.680> I<00:03:20.740> like<00:03:21.100> the<00:03:21.370> design<00:03:21.520> on

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:21.820 
of protection now I like the design on

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:22.920 
of protection now I like the design on
the<00:03:21.880> back<00:03:21.910> of<00:03:22.060> the<00:03:22.240> set<00:03:22.330> I<00:03:22.390> think<00:03:22.630> that's<00:03:22.750> one

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930 
the back of the set I think that's one

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:24.180 
the back of the set I think that's one
of<00:03:22.960> the<00:03:23.110> biggest<00:03:23.260> features<00:03:23.710> of<00:03:23.860> this<00:03:23.920> case

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:24.190 
of the biggest features of this case

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:26.940 
of the biggest features of this case
this<00:03:24.460> nice<00:03:24.670> glittery<00:03:25.240> effect<00:03:25.660> price<00:03:26.560> is<00:03:26.770> good

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:26.950 
this nice glittery effect price is good

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:28.560 
this nice glittery effect price is good
too<00:03:27.190> it's<00:03:27.730> going<00:03:27.850> to<00:03:27.910> cost<00:03:28.060> you<00:03:28.240> around<00:03:28.300> about

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:28.570 
too it's going to cost you around about

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:31.500 
too it's going to cost you around about
13<00:03:29.110> pounds<00:03:29.140> in<00:03:29.710> the<00:03:29.800> UK<00:03:30.190> twenty<00:03:31.150> dollars<00:03:31.480> in
