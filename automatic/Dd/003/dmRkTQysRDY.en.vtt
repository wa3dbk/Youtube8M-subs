00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:18.730 
significant differences with this shot

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:22.380 
significant differences with this shot
basically<00:00:20.010> what<00:00:21.010> you're<00:00:21.100> going<00:00:21.189> to<00:00:21.279> do<00:00:21.369> is<00:00:21.520> the

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:22.390 
basically what you're going to do is the

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:25.249

00:00:25.249 --> 00:00:25.259 
man is going to go behind the ball and

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:27.960 
man is going to go behind the ball and
then<00:00:26.259> hit<00:00:26.439> it<00:00:26.470> into<00:00:26.680> the<00:00:26.740> goal<00:00:26.950> so<00:00:27.369> this<00:00:27.730> kind

then hit it into the goal so this kind

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:32.940 
then hit it into the goal so this kind
of<00:00:28.029> movement<00:00:31.020> also<00:00:32.020> the<00:00:32.290> Swiss<00:00:32.560> are<00:00:32.710> very

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:32.950 
of movement also the Swiss are very

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:34.770 
of movement also the Swiss are very
different<00:00:33.070> about<00:00:33.340> this<00:00:33.460> shot<00:00:33.730> is<00:00:33.880> the<00:00:34.510> hand

00:00:38.069 --> 00:00:38.079 
I'll show later on in the video a bit

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:48.100 
I'll show later on in the video a bit
but<00:00:38.860> this<00:00:39.010> is<00:00:39.070> the<00:00:39.160> basic<00:00:39.460> kind<00:00:39.640> of<00:00:39.700> just

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:48.110 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:49.869

okay guys now I'm going to show you the
basic<00:00:50.239> hand<00:00:50.510> movement<00:00:51.110> of<00:00:51.260> the<00:00:51.440> pin<00:00:51.649> it's<00:00:52.100> very

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:52.309 
basic hand movement of the pin it's very

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:54.310 
basic hand movement of the pin it's very
similar<00:00:52.550> to<00:00:52.670> a<00:00:52.790> snake<00:00:53.030> I<00:00:53.149> guess<00:00:53.360> but<00:00:53.960> what

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:54.320 
similar to a snake I guess but what

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:55.930 
similar to a snake I guess but what
instead<00:00:54.710> of<00:00:54.800> using<00:00:54.949> your<00:00:55.160> wrist<00:00:55.340> like<00:00:55.730> you<00:00:55.820> did

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:55.940 
instead of using your wrist like you did

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.000 
instead of using your wrist like you did
before<00:00:56.000> you're<00:00:56.690> now<00:00:56.840> going<00:00:57.079> to<00:00:57.230> use<00:00:57.410> the<00:00:57.800> palm

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.010 
before you're now going to use the palm

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.549 
before you're now going to use the palm
of<00:00:58.160> your<00:00:58.190> hand<00:00:58.340> and<00:00:59.090> Biscay<00:00:59.449> garbled<00:01:00.019> wit<00:01:00.260> nice

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:00.559 
of your hand and Biscay garbled wit nice

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:01.990 
of your hand and Biscay garbled wit nice
firm<00:01:00.829> grip<00:01:01.070> the<00:01:01.370> mail<00:01:01.519> room<00:01:01.610> it<00:01:01.730> probably

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.000 
firm grip the mail room it probably

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.250 
firm grip the mail room it probably
won't<00:01:02.120> make<00:01:02.210> sure<00:01:02.360> you<00:01:02.480> throw<00:01:02.660> it<00:01:02.780> out<00:01:02.899> the<00:01:03.079> way

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:03.260 
won't make sure you throw it out the way

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.530 
won't make sure you throw it out the way
and<00:01:03.530> basically<00:01:04.400> we'll<00:01:04.850> move<00:01:04.940> on<00:01:05.180> the<00:01:05.300> ball

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:05.540 
and basically we'll move on the ball

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:07.649 
and basically we'll move on the ball
like<00:01:05.869> I<00:01:05.960> said<00:01:06.020> summer<00:01:06.409> move<00:01:07.070> around<00:01:07.310> it<00:01:07.580> and

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:07.659 
like I said summer move around it and

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:10.120 
like I said summer move around it and
then<00:01:08.659> with<00:01:09.020> the<00:01:09.170> power<00:01:09.350> of<00:01:09.380> our<00:01:09.530> hands<00:01:09.740> we<00:01:10.009> are

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.130 
then with the power of our hands we are

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.370 
then with the power of our hands we are
going<00:01:10.250> to<00:01:10.340> flip<00:01:10.700> up<00:01:10.940> as<00:01:11.270> high<00:01:11.390> as<00:01:11.420> we<00:01:11.570> can<00:01:11.840> on

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:12.380 
going to flip up as high as we can on

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:16.300 
going to flip up as high as we can on
this<00:01:12.619> kind<00:01:12.800> of<00:01:12.920> motion<00:01:14.710> okay<00:01:15.710> guys<00:01:15.890> one<00:01:16.130> thing

about the pin is that you don't need to

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.900 
about the pin is that you don't need to
do<00:01:20.300> the<00:01:20.450> go<00:01:20.930> round<00:01:21.229> motion<00:01:21.770> something<00:01:22.700> that's

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:22.910 
do the go round motion something that's

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:24.700 
do the go round motion something that's
much<00:01:23.060> more<00:01:23.119> simple<00:01:23.660> and<00:01:23.810> easy<00:01:24.020> is<00:01:24.320> to<00:01:24.530> just

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:24.710 
much more simple and easy is to just

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:29.020 
much more simple and easy is to just
simply<00:01:25.330> kind<00:01:26.330> of<00:01:26.450> like<00:01:26.750> the<00:01:26.869> snake<00:01:27.140> so<00:01:28.030> hand

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
simply kind of like the snake so hand

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.600 
simply kind of like the snake so hand
action<00:01:29.210> for<00:01:29.479> this<00:01:29.570> is<00:01:29.840> to<00:01:30.200> basically<00:01:30.560> just<00:01:31.160> let

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:31.610 
action for this is to basically just let

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:33.910 
action for this is to basically just let
go<00:01:31.729> of<00:01:31.789> the<00:01:31.940> rod<00:01:32.090> they'll<00:01:32.810> catch<00:01:33.050> it<00:01:33.229> again<00:01:33.320> and

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 
go of the rod they'll catch it again and

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:35.350 
go of the rod they'll catch it again and
make<00:01:34.070> sure<00:01:34.220> you<00:01:34.340> catch<00:01:34.520> it<00:01:34.729> otherwise<00:01:35.000> that<00:01:35.240> is

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:35.360 
make sure you catch it otherwise that is

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.100 
make sure you catch it otherwise that is

you can number them once you get a lot

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:57.340 
you can number them once you get a lot
better<00:01:55.369> it<00:01:55.580> move<00:01:56.150> the<00:01:56.360> ball<00:01:56.510> with<00:01:56.659> control<00:01:57.080> you
