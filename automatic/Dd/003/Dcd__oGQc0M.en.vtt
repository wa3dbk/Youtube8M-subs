variant<00:02:37.570> except<00:02:37.870> for<00:02:38.080> beta<00:02:38.620> ray<00:02:38.860> bill<00:02:39.120> but

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
variant except for beta ray bill but

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.270 
variant except for beta ray bill but
what<00:02:40.569> we'll<00:02:40.690> do<00:02:40.810> is<00:02:40.900> we'll<00:02:41.020> open<00:02:41.380> spider-woman

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
what we'll do is we'll open spider-woman

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:43.620 
what we'll do is we'll open spider-woman
up<00:02:42.580> here<00:02:42.880> and<00:02:43.120> we

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:43.630 
up here and we

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:45.120 
up here and we
we'll<00:02:43.720> have<00:02:43.930> a<00:02:43.960> look<00:02:44.380> at<00:02:44.500> the<00:02:44.650> figure<00:02:44.920> so

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.130 
we'll have a look at the figure so

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:47.670 
we'll have a look at the figure so
here's<00:02:45.460> spider-woman<00:02:46.270> if<00:02:47.110> we<00:02:47.290> have<00:02:47.380> a<00:02:47.410> look<00:02:47.590> at

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
here's spider-woman if we have a look at

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.920 
here's spider-woman if we have a look at
the<00:02:47.800> accessories<00:02:48.220> that<00:02:48.340> she<00:02:48.580> comes<00:02:48.820> with<00:02:49.060> she

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
the accessories that she comes with she

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.890 
the accessories that she comes with she
comes<00:02:50.260> with<00:02:50.500> a<00:02:50.530> stand<00:02:51.280> clip<00:02:51.910> and<00:02:52.210> then<00:02:52.780> the

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
comes with a stand clip and then the

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.010 
comes with a stand clip and then the
idea<00:02:53.200> with<00:02:53.380> the<00:02:53.560> clip<00:02:54.070> is<00:02:54.340> that<00:02:54.370> the<00:02:55.000> the<00:02:55.630> card

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:56.020 
idea with the clip is that the the card

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:58.110 
idea with the clip is that the the card
that<00:02:56.380> she<00:02:56.530> can't<00:02:56.740> comes<00:02:57.070> and<00:02:57.310> also<00:02:57.580> serves<00:02:57.880> as

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
that she can't comes and also serves as

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.640 
that she can't comes and also serves as
a<00:02:58.480> backdrop<00:02:58.810> and<00:02:59.440> then<00:02:59.980> it<00:03:00.100> pour<00:03:00.430> sits<00:03:00.730> in<00:03:00.880> the

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
a backdrop and then it pour sits in the

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.580 
a backdrop and then it pour sits in the
sits<00:03:02.650> in<00:03:02.800> the<00:03:02.890> peg<00:03:03.160> here<00:03:03.480> and<00:03:04.480> then<00:03:04.660> she<00:03:05.440> can

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
sits in the peg here and then she can

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:08.610 
sits in the peg here and then she can
stand<00:03:05.800> in<00:03:06.010> front<00:03:06.190> of<00:03:06.340> it<00:03:06.430> also<00:03:07.300> includes<00:03:07.840> motox

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
stand in front of it also includes motox

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.940 
stand in front of it also includes motox
head<00:03:09.660> which<00:03:10.660> I<00:03:10.930> suppose<00:03:11.290> if<00:03:11.530> you<00:03:11.650> don't<00:03:11.830> get

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
head which I suppose if you don't get

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:14.130 
head which I suppose if you don't get
the<00:03:12.100> other<00:03:12.220> pieces<00:03:12.490> of<00:03:12.790> Modoc<00:03:13.180> you<00:03:13.450> basically

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.140 
the other pieces of Modoc you basically

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:18.240 
the other pieces of Modoc you basically
just<00:03:14.230> have<00:03:14.410> motox<00:03:14.830> head<00:03:15.130> and<00:03:15.510> I<00:03:16.860> won't<00:03:17.860> get<00:03:18.100> the

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.250 
just have motox head and I won't get the

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:20.760 
just have motox head and I won't get the
other<00:03:18.400> characters<00:03:19.330> in<00:03:19.450> this<00:03:19.570> wave<00:03:19.780> so<00:03:20.140> I've

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:20.770 
other characters in this wave so I've

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:23.910 
other characters in this wave so I've
essentially<00:03:21.370> just<00:03:21.670> got<00:03:21.790> Botox<00:03:21.940> head<00:03:22.360> if<00:03:22.920> we

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:23.920 
essentially just got Botox head if we

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:27.960 
essentially just got Botox head if we
have<00:03:24.040> a<00:03:24.070> look<00:03:24.280> at<00:03:24.490> Spider<00:03:25.270> Woman<00:03:25.450> I<00:03:26.970> prefer

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:29.350 
this Spider Woman over the original

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:32.730 
this Spider Woman over the original
Spider<00:03:29.800> Woman<00:03:29.980> figure<00:03:30.790> I<00:03:31.180> like<00:03:31.780> this<00:03:32.050> paint

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
follow the invasion angle on Marvel

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:46.190

Comics<00:03:43.350> of<00:03:44.350> course<00:03:44.620> Spider<00:03:45.160> Woman<00:03:45.280> plays<00:03:45.640> a

predominant<00:03:47.200> role<00:03:47.350> in<00:03:47.710> in<00:03:48.220> that<00:03:48.370> series<00:03:49.260> so<00:03:50.260> I

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:50.290 
predominant role in in that series so I

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:51.540 
predominant role in in that series so I
just<00:03:50.500> thought<00:03:50.710> it<00:03:50.800> was<00:03:50.890> fitting<00:03:51.070> to<00:03:51.220> kind<00:03:51.490> of

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:51.550 
just thought it was fitting to kind of

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:54.780 
just thought it was fitting to kind of
do<00:03:51.670> a<00:03:51.700> review<00:03:52.600> on<00:03:52.660> her<00:03:53.110> the<00:03:54.100> figure<00:03:54.430> itself

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:54.790 
do a review on her the figure itself

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:58.140 
do a review on her the figure itself
isn't<00:03:55.090> isn't<00:03:55.720> too<00:03:56.140> bad<00:03:56.440> there's<00:03:57.310> some<00:03:57.850> gripes

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:58.150 
isn't isn't too bad there's some gripes

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:00.900 
isn't isn't too bad there's some gripes

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:00.910 
I have with the figure one of them is

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:03.780 
I have with the figure one of them is
that<00:04:01.330> the<00:04:01.900> I<00:04:02.110> don't<00:04:02.440> like<00:04:02.530> the<00:04:02.890> low<00:04:03.250> lower

waist area of the figure I know you can
if<00:04:07.690> pretty<00:04:08.440> clear<00:04:08.980> that<00:04:09.010> you<00:04:09.580> can<00:04:09.700> see<00:04:09.910> what

females in the Marvel Legends always

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:27.000 
females in the Marvel Legends always
came<00:04:24.580> across<00:04:24.820> like<00:04:25.350> you<00:04:26.350> could<00:04:26.500> see<00:04:26.680> that<00:04:26.860> you

came across like you could see that you

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:29.130 
came across like you could see that you
could<00:04:27.070> see<00:04:27.340> the<00:04:27.490> joints<00:04:27.970> on<00:04:28.180> the<00:04:28.870> figure

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:29.140 
could see the joints on the figure

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:32.460 
could see the joints on the figure
itself<00:04:30.060> it<00:04:31.060> doesn't<00:04:31.690> look<00:04:31.930> like<00:04:31.960> it's<00:04:32.320> a

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:32.470 
itself it doesn't look like it's a

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:37.300 
it just kind of looks like you know you

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:39.510 
it just kind of looks like you know you
you<00:04:37.840> got<00:04:37.990> her<00:04:38.080> torso<00:04:38.380> then<00:04:38.950> you<00:04:39.040> got<00:04:39.220> you<00:04:39.370> can

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:53.040 
don't I'm not a big fan of the hands I

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:55.740 
don't I'm not a big fan of the hands I
find<00:04:54.040> the<00:04:54.220> hands<00:04:54.490> look<00:04:54.880> first<00:04:55.180> of<00:04:55.300> all<00:04:55.419> way<00:04:55.690> too

find the hands look first of all way too

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:57.750 
find the hands look first of all way too
large<00:04:56.290> for<00:04:56.440> the<00:04:56.710> figure

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:57.760 
large for the figure

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:00.600 
large for the figure
also<00:04:58.270> they<00:04:58.540> they've<00:04:58.990> decided<00:04:59.440> to<00:04:59.710> put<00:04:59.950> open

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:00.610 
also they they've decided to put open

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:04.350 
also they they've decided to put open
hands<00:05:00.940> on<00:05:01.060> both<00:05:01.300> their<00:05:01.540> both<00:05:02.290> hands<00:05:03.150> on<00:05:04.150> both

hands on both their both hands on both

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:06.870 
hands on both their both hands on both
of<00:05:04.510> her<00:05:04.600> hands<00:05:04.840> so<00:05:05.140> as<00:05:05.260> a<00:05:05.290> result<00:05:05.640> they<00:05:06.640> just

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:06.880 
of her hands so as a result they just

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:09.900 
of her hands so as a result they just
look<00:05:07.150> too<00:05:07.420> large<00:05:07.750> for<00:05:07.900> the<00:05:08.200> figure<00:05:08.560> I<00:05:09.220> would

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:09.910 
look too large for the figure I would

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:11.040 
look too large for the figure I would
have<00:05:10.000> liked<00:05:10.360> if<00:05:10.510> they<00:05:10.660> were<00:05:10.720> a<00:05:10.780> little<00:05:10.930> bit

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:11.050 
have liked if they were a little bit

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:13.800 
have liked if they were a little bit
smaller<00:05:11.910> and<00:05:12.910> then<00:05:13.180> of<00:05:13.300> course<00:05:13.540> you've<00:05:13.780> got

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:13.810 
smaller and then of course you've got

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:16.410 
smaller and then of course you've got
the<00:05:14.020> the<00:05:14.680> symbol<00:05:15.070> here<00:05:15.280> I've<00:05:15.880> got<00:05:16.120> a<00:05:16.150> little

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:16.420 
the the symbol here I've got a little

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:18.360 
the the symbol here I've got a little
bit<00:05:16.510> of<00:05:16.600> paint<00:05:16.870> that's<00:05:17.560> come<00:05:17.890> off<00:05:17.920> mine

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:18.370 
bit of paint that's come off mine

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:23.400 
bit of paint that's come off mine
unfortunately<00:05:20.670> another<00:05:21.670> issue<00:05:22.000> with<00:05:22.540> the<00:05:22.750> at

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:23.410 
unfortunately another issue with the at

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:25.860 
unfortunately another issue with the at
least<00:05:23.560> the<00:05:23.710> women<00:05:24.040> side<00:05:25.030> of<00:05:25.180> Marvel<00:05:25.510> Legends

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:25.870 
least the women side of Marvel Legends

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:27.990 
least the women side of Marvel Legends
was<00:05:26.050> the<00:05:26.170> fact<00:05:26.380> that<00:05:26.490> because<00:05:27.490> of<00:05:27.700> the<00:05:27.880> way

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:28.000 
was the fact that because of the way

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.910 
was the fact that because of the way
they're<00:05:28.180> jointed<00:05:28.720> they<00:05:29.050> don't<00:05:29.230> stand<00:05:29.620> all

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:29.920 
they're jointed they don't stand all

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:34.950 
they're jointed they don't stand all
that<00:05:29.950> well<00:05:32.220> their<00:05:33.220> legs<00:05:33.490> are<00:05:33.730> very<00:05:33.960> bowlegs

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:34.960 
that well their legs are very bowlegs

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:38.940 
that well their legs are very bowlegs
bowlegged<00:05:35.740> I<00:05:35.980> guess<00:05:36.990> there<00:05:37.990> is<00:05:38.140> on<00:05:38.440> the<00:05:38.800> back

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:38.950 
bowlegged I guess there is on the back

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:40.890 
bowlegged I guess there is on the back
of<00:05:39.130> the<00:05:39.190> figure<00:05:39.490> however<00:05:39.730> there<00:05:40.120> is<00:05:40.270> a<00:05:40.450> peg

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:40.900 
of the figure however there is a peg

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:45.420 
of the figure however there is a peg
hole<00:05:41.170> you<00:05:41.980> can<00:05:42.130> get<00:05:42.460> the<00:05:43.350> mountable<00:05:44.430> stands

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:45.430 
hole you can get the mountable stands

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:46.950 
hole you can get the mountable stands
that<00:05:45.640> peg<00:05:45.910> into<00:05:46.180> the<00:05:46.210> back<00:05:46.510> so<00:05:46.780> you<00:05:46.810> can

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:46.960 
that peg into the back so you can

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:49.710 
that peg into the back so you can
actually<00:05:47.080> have<00:05:47.410> her<00:05:47.650> standing<00:05:48.180> they<00:05:49.180> didn't

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:49.720 
actually have her standing they didn't

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:50.970 
actually have her standing they didn't
include<00:05:50.020> it<00:05:50.170> with<00:05:50.290> this<00:05:50.470> figure<00:05:50.800> and<00:05:50.890> they

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:50.980 
include it with this figure and they

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:52.290 
include it with this figure and they
didn't<00:05:51.190> actually<00:05:51.280> include<00:05:51.790> those<00:05:51.970> stands

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:52.300 
didn't actually include those stands

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:54.420 
didn't actually include those stands
with<00:05:52.480> a<00:05:52.510> lot<00:05:52.750> of<00:05:52.780> the<00:05:52.960> figures<00:05:53.320> I<00:05:53.560> think<00:05:54.160> until

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:54.430 
with a lot of the figures I think until

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:58.680 
with a lot of the figures I think until
later<00:05:54.700> on<00:05:54.820> in<00:05:55.000> the<00:05:55.300> series<00:05:56.160> but<00:05:57.480> it's<00:05:58.480> not<00:05:58.660> a

00:05:58.680 --> 00:05:58.690 
later on in the series but it's not a

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:01.020 
later on in the series but it's not a
bad<00:05:58.870> figure<00:05:59.200> I<00:05:59.530> don't<00:05:59.860> think<00:06:00.160> I'd<00:06:00.280> suggest<00:06:00.820> it

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:01.030 
bad figure I don't think I'd suggest it

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:03.180
