bars you actually have is depending on

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.270 
bars you actually have is depending on
what<00:02:50.329> Saab<00:02:50.629> SCS<00:02:51.200> compression<00:02:51.799> you<00:02:51.920> should<00:02:52.129> get

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
what Saab SCS compression you should get

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.629 
what Saab SCS compression you should get
because<00:02:52.760> this<00:02:53.540> is<00:02:53.870> a<00:02:54.319> big<00:02:54.680> compression<00:02:55.250> system

00:02:55.629 --> 00:02:55.639 
because this is a big compression system

00:02:55.639 --> 00:02:58.030 
because this is a big compression system
but<00:02:56.209> then<00:02:56.389> again<00:02:56.540> you<00:02:56.989> can<00:02:57.079> get<00:02:57.260> baby<00:02:57.620> SES

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
but then again you can get baby SES

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.640 
but then again you can get baby SES
which<00:02:58.700> is<00:02:58.970> for<00:02:59.180> undersized<00:02:59.599> bars<00:02:59.900> just<00:03:00.200> like

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.650 
which is for undersized bars just like

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:05.710 
which is for undersized bars just like
this<00:03:01.040> with<00:03:01.400> our<00:03:01.639> shim<00:03:03.639> by<00:03:04.639> that<00:03:04.819> but<00:03:05.510> you<00:03:05.599> can

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:05.720 
this with our shim by that but you can

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.599 
this with our shim by that but you can
put<00:03:05.930> a<00:03:05.959> shim<00:03:06.230> on<00:03:06.260> if<00:03:06.620> you<00:03:06.889> are<00:03:06.920> going<00:03:07.040> to<00:03:07.250> use<00:03:07.430> it

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:07.609 
put a shim on if you are going to use it

00:03:07.609 --> 00:03:10.089 
put a shim on if you are going to use it
with<00:03:07.730> big<00:03:08.450> compression<00:03:09.019> system<00:03:09.379> like<00:03:09.680> the<00:03:09.980> one

00:03:10.089 --> 00:03:10.099 
with big compression system like the one

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:14.530 
with big compression system like the one
I<00:03:10.129> have<00:03:10.489> and<00:03:11.150> that<00:03:11.629> is<00:03:11.750> an<00:03:11.959> SCS<00:03:12.439> shim<00:03:13.269> these<00:03:14.269> are

really just two of them I'll work I'll
just<00:03:45.319> one<00:03:45.709> but<00:03:46.340> two<00:03:46.370> makes<00:03:46.909> it<00:03:47.090> a<00:03:47.120> bit<00:03:47.239> more

00:03:47.259 --> 00:03:47.269 
just one but two makes it a bit more

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:50.589 
just one but two makes it a bit more
solid<00:03:47.659> so<00:03:48.639> you've<00:03:49.639> got<00:03:49.790> half<00:03:50.000> your<00:03:50.030> scooter

00:03:50.589 --> 00:03:50.599

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:55.370 
with the SES onto the Fox you now need

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:59.379 
with the SES onto the Fox you now need
to<00:03:55.430> put<00:03:55.790> a<00:03:56.000> pair<00:03:56.239> of<00:03:56.269> bars<00:03:56.629> on<00:03:57.069> so<00:03:58.069> I'm<00:03:58.970> going<00:03:59.299> to

00:03:59.379 --> 00:03:59.389 
to put a pair of bars on so I'm going to

00:03:59.389 --> 00:04:04.930 
to put a pair of bars on so I'm going to
put<00:03:59.569> the<00:03:59.870> eight<00:04:00.620> own<00:04:00.919> custom<00:04:01.370> bars<00:04:01.549> on<00:04:03.940> with

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:04.940 
put the eight own custom bars on with

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:09.159 
put the eight own custom bars on with
the<00:04:05.120> two<00:04:05.419> district<00:04:05.840> shims<00:04:06.400> also<00:04:07.750> you<00:04:08.750> cannot

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:09.169 
the two district shims also you cannot

00:04:09.169 --> 00:04:13.180 
the two district shims also you cannot
use<00:04:09.769> a<00:04:10.040> slips<00:04:10.519> with<00:04:11.030> SES<00:04:11.810> it<00:04:12.500> will<00:04:12.769> snap<00:04:13.040> your

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:13.190 
use a slips with SES it will snap your

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:16.580 
use a slips with SES it will snap your
bars<00:04:13.459> in<00:04:13.819> minutes<00:04:14.629> seriously

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
bars in minutes seriously

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:21.989 
bars in minutes seriously
so<00:04:17.590> I'm<00:04:17.949> going<00:04:18.249> to<00:04:18.340> place<00:04:19.979> these<00:04:20.979> bars<00:04:21.340> in<00:04:21.729> the

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:21.999 
so I'm going to place these bars in the

00:04:21.999 --> 00:04:26.040 
so I'm going to place these bars in the
SCS<00:04:22.479> compression<00:04:23.080> system<00:04:24.749> when<00:04:25.749> I've<00:04:25.840> got<00:04:26.020> a

foolish straight guy to push it in like

00:04:32.499 --> 00:04:32.969 
foolish straight guy to push it in like
that

00:04:32.969 --> 00:04:32.979 
that

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:39.330 
that
now<00:04:33.939> I<00:04:34.300> need<00:04:34.830> for<00:04:35.830> SCS<00:04:36.400> bolts<00:04:36.789> and<00:04:37.830> a<00:04:38.830> 5<00:04:39.099> mil

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:39.340 
now I need for SCS bolts and a 5 mil

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:40.860 
now I need for SCS bolts and a 5 mil
allen<00:04:39.580> key<00:04:39.729> to<00:04:39.939> tighten<00:04:40.240> them

ride<00:04:58.590> but<00:04:59.590> I<00:04:59.620> found<00:04:59.919> of<00:05:00.129> using<00:05:00.719> compression

00:05:01.709 --> 00:05:01.719 
ride but I found of using compression

00:05:01.719 --> 00:05:05.490 
ride but I found of using compression
like<00:05:01.840> HIC<00:05:02.710> ICS<00:05:03.639> seems<00:05:04.629> to<00:05:04.750> come<00:05:04.900> loose<00:05:05.139> but

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:05.500 
like HIC ICS seems to come loose but

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:08.730 
like HIC ICS seems to come loose but
with<00:05:06.250> SCS<00:05:06.759> compression<00:05:07.389> I've<00:05:07.659> seen<00:05:08.349> to<00:05:08.500> find

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:08.740 
with SCS compression I've seen to find

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:11.610 
with SCS compression I've seen to find
that<00:05:09.009> it<00:05:10.000> doesn't<00:05:10.180> really<00:05:10.360> actually<00:05:10.870> do<00:05:11.409> come

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:11.620 
that it doesn't really actually do come

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:16.709 
that it doesn't really actually do come
loose<00:05:12.689> not<00:05:13.689> much<00:05:13.900> actually<00:05:14.139> if<00:05:14.620> not<00:05:14.919> ever<00:05:15.719> also

00:05:16.709 --> 00:05:16.719 
loose not much actually if not ever also

00:05:16.719 --> 00:05:19.559 
loose not much actually if not ever also

00:05:19.569 --> 00:05:22.409 
doesn't wobble with hitch se and I made
your<00:05:19.719> balls<00:05:20.050> and<00:05:20.379> with<00:05:20.469> ICS<00:05:20.979> I've<00:05:21.849> had<00:05:22.029> ICS

00:05:22.409 --> 00:05:22.419 
your balls and with ICS I've had ICS

00:05:22.419 --> 00:05:25.079 
your balls and with ICS I've had ICS
snap<00:05:22.719> in<00:05:22.960> with<00:05:23.169> this<00:05:23.550> L<00:05:24.550> I<00:05:24.669> think<00:05:24.849> really

00:05:25.079 --> 00:05:25.089 
snap in with this L I think really

00:05:25.089 --> 00:05:26.820 
snap in with this L I think really
anyone's<00:05:25.479> ever<00:05:25.599> snap<00:05:25.870> to<00:05:25.990> pro<00:05:26.169> SES<00:05:26.500> to<00:05:26.770> be

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:26.830 
anyone's ever snap to pro SES to be

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:28.980 
anyone's ever snap to pro SES to be
honest<00:05:27.099> so<00:05:28.029> when<00:05:28.180> you<00:05:28.240> put<00:05:28.389> your<00:05:28.419> bolts<00:05:28.870> in

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:28.990 
honest so when you put your bolts in

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:32.209 
honest so when you put your bolts in
like<00:05:29.139> that

00:05:32.209 --> 00:05:32.219 

00:05:32.219 --> 00:05:36.709 

you<00:05:33.219> want<00:05:33.339> to<00:05:33.399> be<00:05:33.490> using<00:05:33.610> a<00:05:33.789> 5<00:05:34.029> mil<00:05:34.409> to

00:05:36.709 --> 00:05:36.719 
you want to be using a 5 mil to

00:05:36.719 --> 00:05:41.519 
you want to be using a 5 mil to
basically<00:05:37.800> tighten<00:05:38.800> these<00:05:39.699> up<00:05:40.379> don't<00:05:41.379> need<00:05:41.469> to

00:05:41.519 --> 00:05:41.529 
basically tighten these up don't need to

00:05:41.529 --> 00:05:47.129 
basically tighten these up don't need to
be<00:05:41.589> really<00:05:41.860> tight<00:05:42.099> just<00:05:44.939> just<00:05:45.939> so<00:05:46.120> you<00:05:46.990> know

00:05:47.129 --> 00:05:47.139 
be really tight just just so you know
