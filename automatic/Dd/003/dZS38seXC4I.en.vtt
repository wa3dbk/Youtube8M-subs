00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:23.870
 in auto bild let's live a 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:27.380
 unique experience we are on board the 

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:32.060
 porsche 918 spyder a vehicle almost 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:33.890
 800 thousand euros that has 800 87 horses 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:37.640
 this power nothing a gasoline engine 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:40.820
 of 8 cylinders in v of 600 eight horses 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:43.699
 plus two 285 electric motors 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:46.220
 horses in total what I tell you 887 

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:50.199
 horses we will enjoy as dwarfs 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:50.199
 and accelerates from 0 to 100 in 26 seconds 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:01:00.380
 we currently count on the 918 spyder 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.790
 with the same steering wheel as in the mach 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:03.590
 which will lead future models of 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:05.540
 porsche but a very different 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:09.009
 important is here on the button of the 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:09.009
 different ignition maps 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:15.740
 in the porsche 918 spyder there are five modes 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:17.720
 of driving and for the mode and power h 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:20.300
 for hybrid mode s for mode 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:22.580
 sport and race mode and in race mode 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:23.899
 you leave the active red button pressed 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.190
 hot lab mode for laps of 

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:27.050
 career qualification for example 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:29.150
 where you have the maximum 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:34.460
 even circulating with the engines 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:35.690
 empty electric then when 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:37.430
 you start with the key on the side 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:38.960
 left as good porch is 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:41.150
 ready to start the march in the 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.100
 power mode 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:46.550
 so the only thing we have to do 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:48.110
 is to remove the electric handbrake on 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:50.750
 the electric mode accelerates from 0 to 100 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:52.910
 kilometers per hour in about 6 seconds and 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:55.490
 reaches a maximum speed of 150 

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:57.410
 kilometers per hour if you overcome 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:59.800
 speed the combustion engine is 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:59.800
 turn on 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.140
 but you can change the mode of 

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:06.759
 driving whenever you want if you put the 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:08.920
 sport mode the gasoline engine will 

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:11.560
 active and you can reach your maximum 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:13.510
 speed of 345 kilometers per hour 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.840
 but they offer less force than in the mode 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.840
 race 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.670
 if you drive on an open road to 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:27.510
 traffic you can choose the hybrid mode and 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:29.280
 the engine goes off the hybrid mode is 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.739
 suitable for low power consumption and with 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:35.730
 electric mode you can go about 60 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:37.650
 kilometers in this mode turns on or 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:41.090
 turns off the combustion engine according to 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.090
 of the demand with the accelerator 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:45.790
 it accelerated the engine is understood and 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.620
 deliver more power if there is more traffic 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:50.130
 in front the engine shuts down and circulates in 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.130
 electric mode 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:57.580
 and if you drive in the power mode and 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:59.290
 you tighten the throttle to the engine 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:01.660
 of combustion is turned on to deliver 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:03.580
 all the power required if you go 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:05.740
 quiet and release the pedal the engine will 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:07.720
 again turn off the reason is that power 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:10.000
 circulate in power mode but if 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.650
 you need to overtake a vehicle 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.190
 you can also have all the power 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:14.190
 to do it 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:20.480
 now let's put in race mode for 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.380
 Enjoy the greatest acceleration 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.380
 possible 

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:38.180
 and its deceleration is also surprising 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:40.250
 we have been automatic mode but also 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:43.540
 you can press manual mode and change 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:43.540
 with the steering wheel cams or 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.760
 by5 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:28.310
 so when you need all the 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:32.950
 power and squeeze the throttle to butt 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:32.950
 he takes the available electric power 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:38.750
 and if you want to recharge the batteries 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:41.110
 we're still in race mode and so 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:44.110
 it takes less than 8 minutes to recharge 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:44.110
 completely 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:50.190
 if you need to brake braking 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:52.280
 regenerative and also recharges 

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:52.280
 batteries 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:59.470
 let's slow down and look at the first 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:59.470
 engine how it recharges little by little 

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:05.720
 yes 

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:11.960
 when 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:13.789
 and this makes it any way we 

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:15.440
 the hybrid mode to arrive quietly 

00:05:13.789 --> 00:05:17.650
 to our starting point and this is 

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:17.650
 all 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:24.180
 it's a fascinating experience many 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:24.180
 thanks for everything 

00:05:26.099 --> 00:05:32.909
 now you have seen awesome friends 

00:05:28.989 --> 00:05:32.909
 of 18
