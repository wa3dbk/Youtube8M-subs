scrub<00:00:08.340> and<00:00:08.490> in<00:00:08.639> this<00:00:08.730> video<00:00:08.940> we're<00:00:09.179> going<00:00:09.300> to

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
scrub and in this video we're going to

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:12.200 
scrub and in this video we're going to
put<00:00:09.570> the<00:00:10.200> grant<00:00:10.440> against<00:00:10.830> the<00:00:10.920> s4<00:00:11.429> so<00:00:12.090> the

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
put the grant against the s4 so the

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.600 
put the grant against the s4 so the
ground<00:00:12.450> is<00:00:12.570> running<00:00:12.840> an<00:00:12.960> older<00:00:13.290> 4.1.2<00:00:14.130> Android

bean on a set of two quad-core
processors<00:00:22.279> so<00:00:23.279> let's<00:00:23.460> talk<00:00:23.670> size<00:00:23.910> the<00:00:24.600> s4<00:00:25.080> is

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
processors so let's talk size the s4 is

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.560 
processors so let's talk size the s4 is
five<00:00:25.590> inches<00:00:25.800> and<00:00:25.980> so<00:00:26.580> is<00:00:26.760> the<00:00:26.910> Galaxy<00:00:27.330> grant

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
five inches and so is the Galaxy grant

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.589 
five inches and so is the Galaxy grant
but<00:00:28.320> the<00:00:28.439> s4<00:00:28.980> has<00:00:29.220> resolution<00:00:29.820> of<00:00:29.970> 1080<00:00:30.570> by

on<00:02:13.650> the<00:02:13.800> s4<00:02:14.160> is<00:02:14.190> slightly<00:02:14.670> new<00:02:14.910> and<00:02:15.180> more

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
on the s4 is slightly new and more

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:20.030 
on the s4 is slightly new and more
advanced<00:02:15.959> hopefully<00:02:16.680> the<00:02:16.940> s4<00:02:18.170> features<00:02:19.170> not

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
advanced hopefully the s4 features not

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.590 
advanced hopefully the s4 features not
all<00:02:20.190> of<00:02:20.340> them<00:02:20.490> but<00:02:20.580> quite<00:02:21.150> a<00:02:21.180> few<00:02:21.330> of<00:02:21.450> them

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
all of them but quite a few of them

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.990 
all of them but quite a few of them
would<00:02:21.840> be<00:02:21.990> ported<00:02:22.800> to<00:02:22.830> galaxy<00:02:23.280> grant<00:02:23.520> as<00:02:23.640> well

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
would be ported to galaxy grant as well

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.900 
would be ported to galaxy grant as well
now<00:02:24.480> the<00:02:24.540> Settings<00:02:25.080> panel<00:02:25.140> has<00:02:25.560> been<00:02:25.910> quite

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
now the Settings panel has been quite

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:28.460 
now the Settings panel has been quite
revamped<00:02:27.660> and<00:02:27.840> as<00:02:27.930> you<00:02:28.050> can<00:02:28.170> see<00:02:28.319> it's

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
revamped and as you can see it's

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.920 
revamped and as you can see it's
categorized<00:02:29.010> properly<00:02:29.390> between<00:02:30.390> my<00:02:30.630> devices

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
categorized properly between my devices

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:32.900 
categorized properly between my devices
accounts<00:02:31.530> and<00:02:31.650> more<00:02:31.830> so<00:02:32.370> you<00:02:32.430> know<00:02:32.550> you<00:02:32.670> know

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
accounts and more so you know you know

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.840 
accounts and more so you know you know
where<00:02:33.120> is<00:02:33.270> what<00:02:33.720> except<00:02:34.560> in<00:02:34.800> the<00:02:35.310> galaxy<00:02:35.640> grant

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
where is what except in the galaxy grant

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:38.090 
where is what except in the galaxy grant
it's<00:02:36.000> all<00:02:36.120> in<00:02:36.239> a<00:02:36.300> list<00:02:36.510> the<00:02:37.380> gallery<00:02:37.770> view<00:02:37.950> is

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
it's all in a list the gallery view is

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:41.510 
it's all in a list the gallery view is
also<00:02:38.370> slightly<00:02:38.550> different<00:02:39.030> in<00:02:39.630> the<00:02:40.260> galaxy<00:02:40.980> s4

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
also slightly different in the galaxy s4

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.610 
also slightly different in the galaxy s4
you<00:02:42.120> now<00:02:42.330> have<00:02:42.569> air<00:02:42.780> gesture<00:02:43.260> which<00:02:43.410> do<00:02:43.590> not

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
you now have air gesture which do not

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.229 
you now have air gesture which do not
have<00:02:43.830> on<00:02:44.069> the<00:02:44.160> galaxy<00:02:44.520> grand<00:02:44.640> as<00:02:44.790> you<00:02:44.910> can<00:02:45.060> see

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
have on the galaxy grand as you can see

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:47.330 
have on the galaxy grand as you can see
so<00:02:45.810> when<00:02:45.989> I<00:02:46.019> just<00:02:46.110> hover<00:02:46.440> my<00:02:46.650> finger<00:02:46.980> over<00:02:47.100> the

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
so when I just hover my finger over the

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:48.830 
so when I just hover my finger over the
image<00:02:47.640> it<00:02:47.790> just<00:02:48.000> gives<00:02:48.180> me<00:02:48.269> a<00:02:48.390> quick<00:02:48.660> preview

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
image it just gives me a quick preview

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.520 
image it just gives me a quick preview
just<00:02:49.680> a<00:02:50.130> good<00:02:50.250> feature<00:02:50.400> to<00:02:50.519> have<00:02:51.320> now<00:02:52.320> let's

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
just a good feature to have now let's

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:53.990 
just a good feature to have now let's
talk<00:02:52.620> about<00:02:52.830> the<00:02:52.920> camera<00:02:53.100> interface<00:02:53.370> on<00:02:53.790> the

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
talk about the camera interface on the

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.759 
talk about the camera interface on the
s4<00:02:54.390> it's<00:02:54.600> a<00:02:54.750> lot<00:02:54.959> like<00:02:55.170> what<00:02:55.410> you've<00:02:55.560> seen<00:02:55.680> on

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:55.769 
s4 it's a lot like what you've seen on

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:57.350 
s4 it's a lot like what you've seen on
the<00:02:55.890> Galaxy<00:02:56.250> camera<00:02:56.400> so<00:02:56.820> you<00:02:56.880> know<00:02:57.060> you've<00:02:57.180> got

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
the Galaxy camera so you know you've got

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.170 
the Galaxy camera so you know you've got
a<00:02:57.660> whole<00:02:57.959> bunch<00:02:57.989> of<00:02:58.319> new<00:02:58.500> modes<00:02:58.800> and<00:02:59.040> a<00:02:59.700> lot<00:03:00.030> of

a whole bunch of new modes and a lot of

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:01.699 
a whole bunch of new modes and a lot of
fluid<00:03:00.450> effects<00:03:00.780> a<00:03:00.900> lot<00:03:01.050> of<00:03:01.140> color<00:03:01.350> effects

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
fluid effects a lot of color effects

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:03.860 
fluid effects a lot of color effects
that<00:03:01.920> is<00:03:02.130> and<00:03:02.340> you<00:03:02.670> can<00:03:02.819> apply<00:03:03.120> these<00:03:03.180> effects

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
that is and you can apply these effects

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:05.180 
that is and you can apply these effects
even<00:03:04.140> before<00:03:04.260> you<00:03:04.470> take<00:03:04.620> a<00:03:04.650> picture<00:03:04.920> so<00:03:05.130> you

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
even before you take a picture so you

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.160 
even before you take a picture so you
know<00:03:05.310> you<00:03:05.430> have<00:03:05.550> a<00:03:05.580> live<00:03:05.790> preview<00:03:06.090> now<00:03:07.019> in<00:03:07.110> the
