spotter who provides too much help or
not<00:01:18.760> enough<00:01:19.090> help<00:01:19.710> will<00:01:20.710> negate<00:01:21.070> the<00:01:21.310> benefits

of<00:01:22.030> forced<00:01:22.450> reps<00:01:24.600> that's<00:01:25.600> why<00:01:25.930> it's<00:01:26.140> important

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:26.680 
of forced reps that's why it's important

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.980 
of forced reps that's why it's important
that<00:01:26.710> they<00:01:26.950> provide<00:01:27.340> just<00:01:27.820> enough<00:01:27.940> help<00:01:28.390> so

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:28.990 
that they provide just enough help so

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:34.330 
that they provide just enough help so
that<00:01:29.170> you<00:01:29.530> can<00:01:29.890> keep<00:01:30.070> the<00:01:30.280> set<00:01:30.550> going
