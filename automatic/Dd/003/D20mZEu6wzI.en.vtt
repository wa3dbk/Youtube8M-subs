00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
as a conservationist they launched this

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.020 
as a conservationist they launched this
conservation<00:00:52.019> campaign<00:00:52.800> through<00:00:53.580> their

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
conservation campaign through their

conservation campaign through their
church<00:00:54.860> they<00:00:55.860> went<00:00:56.190> to<00:00:56.400> traditions<00:00:57.059> that<00:00:57.390> they

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
church they went to traditions that they

knew gospel music God and passion and
they<00:01:02.489> went<00:01:02.699> up<00:01:02.820> against<00:01:03.210> this<00:01:03.330> refinery<00:01:03.809> in

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
they went up against this refinery in

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.670 
they went up against this refinery in
southern<00:01:04.409> Louisiana<00:01:05.100> that<00:01:06.000> was<00:01:06.290> did<00:01:07.290> not<00:01:07.470> have

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
southern Louisiana that was did not have

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.300 
southern Louisiana that was did not have
monitors<00:01:08.190> on<00:01:08.430> their<00:01:08.610> stacks<00:01:08.940> and<00:01:09.270> they<00:01:09.840> won

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:10.310 
monitors on their stacks and they won

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.310 
monitors on their stacks and they won
the<00:01:11.310> stack<00:01:11.640> emissions<00:01:11.850> were<00:01:12.750> finally

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
the stack emissions were finally

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.980 
the stack emissions were finally
regulated<00:01:14.960> this<00:01:15.960> idea<00:01:16.890> of<00:01:17.159> putting<00:01:17.990> religion

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
regulated this idea of putting religion

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.319 
regulated this idea of putting religion
and<00:01:19.170> conservation<00:01:20.009> had<00:01:20.549> never<00:01:20.789> really

00:01:21.319 --> 00:01:21.329 
and conservation had never really

00:01:21.329 --> 00:01:24.020 
and conservation had never really
occurred<00:01:21.750> to<00:01:21.960> me<00:01:22.079> before<00:01:22.460> I'd<00:01:23.460> been<00:01:23.700> working

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
occurred to me before I'd been working

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.270 
occurred to me before I'd been working
in<00:01:24.149> conservation<00:01:24.570> for<00:01:25.259> a<00:01:25.500> number<00:01:25.979> of<00:01:26.159> years

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
in conservation for a number of years

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.920 
in conservation for a number of years
and<00:01:27.409> this<00:01:28.409> was<00:01:28.649> a<00:01:28.680> new<00:01:28.950> idea<00:01:29.359> six<00:01:30.359> years<00:01:30.689> after

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
and this was a new idea six years after

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.630 
and this was a new idea six years after
this<00:01:31.500> occurred<00:01:32.130> I<00:01:32.810> was<00:01:34.039> going<00:01:35.039> down<00:01:35.159> to

a<00:02:36.230> sacred<00:02:36.710> value<00:02:37.400> so<00:02:38.180> it<00:02:38.480> occurred<00:02:39.080> to<00:02:39.110> me<00:02:39.410> that

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
a sacred value so it occurred to me that

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.650 
a sacred value so it occurred to me that
I<00:02:39.680> needed<00:02:40.130> to<00:02:40.250> go<00:02:40.520> to<00:02:40.580> the<00:02:40.820> religious<00:02:41.300> leaders

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:41.660

and<00:02:41.870> begin<00:02:42.320> to<00:02:42.350> talk<00:02:42.680> to<00:02:42.890> them<00:02:43.130> it<00:02:43.580> was<00:02:44.300> when<00:02:44.600> I

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
and begin to talk to them it was when I

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:51.250
