00:00:00.639 --> 00:00:03.639
 here are the images that were taken during the accident 

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:10.869
 bike 

00:00:10.869 --> 00:00:13.229
 the directors of the systems 

00:00:13.229 --> 00:00:15.029
 thanks to them 

00:00:15.029 --> 00:00:17.159
 to appeal 

00:00:17.159 --> 00:00:19.390
 a mother at this time close to the antenna 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:22.220
 the pilot wanted to land at barns who wanted to refuel 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:25.410
 advanced like that you have to land on a mobile platform so that 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.460
 helicopters can then be removed to the station of 150 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:30.479
 plots were 39 points 

00:00:30.479 --> 00:00:34.429
 it is worth to me any other form speaking very fantastic in Bordeaux ranking 

00:00:34.429 --> 00:00:35.629
 do not pronounce themselves 

00:00:35.629 --> 00:00:38.460
 it's this week that the scene 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:39.780
 Mass 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.479
 in turn control asked him to land on this platform 

00:00:42.479 --> 00:00:46.239
 but the traits 3 first he did not want to shoot from it and after his skate 

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:48.810
 slipped and flipped 

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:51.810
 we are not judging 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.470
 recently an important step is important 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:59.900
 he had bad luck as I said the platform is very narrow and 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.170
 the helicopter must land in a very precise way 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:05.700
 he misjudged distance and he passed with one of the skates and that's it 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.230
 enough is a woman's shot is unique because we test in this context because 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:10.410
 that as we can 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:11.840
 in room on request 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.979
 this mobile platform landing a surface 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:18.210
 nick fury of 6 meters on three fifty meters was causing 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.470
 the accident 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.690
 if to dare to ask for extreme precision 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:26.990
 although experienced amateur pilots who had rented in June did not 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:28.540
 air is needed 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:31.950
 the use of this type of platform is extremely 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:36.729
 the driver who was able to extricate itself from the cabin is still in shock 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:41.750
 remember by the way because apple will not appeal status quo the peer-to-peer duck 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.920
 is a little blues accents the pilot was lucky she's fine he did not 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.270
 been seriously hurt he is naturally very shocked 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.130
 today he stayed at home to rest but given the 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.360
 circumstances will not happen again was a great opportunity to do the 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.150
 Party 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:59.050
 completely destroyed the helicopter has already been moved into the hangars 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:01.370
 ten high school students out of sight 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:03.610
 for further examinations 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:07.280
 the accident caused no casualties or injuries but the material damage 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.250
 are estimated at one point 3 million francs 

00:02:12.109 --> 00:02:16.349
 an investigation was initiated to determine the exact circumstances of the 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:18.429
 this crash on landing 

00:02:18.429 --> 00:02:22.339
 the flood at the museum to the point where we can only wish the investigated office 

00:02:22.339 --> 00:02:25.279
 about aviation accidents with the police opened an investigation and 

00:02:25.279 --> 00:02:27.840
 now we are going to establish the feasts of what went wrong 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.790
 and why not exactly this accident happened on the road we can also 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:33.099
 think 

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:35.389
 This series of accidents nevertheless remains extremely
