00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:09.979 
how you're supposed to be using Nate and

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:12.190 
how you're supposed to be using Nate and
battlefield<00:01:10.490> 4<00:01:10.790> but<00:01:11.330> basically<00:01:11.540> all<00:01:12.020> I'm

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:12.200 
battlefield 4 but basically all I'm

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.930 
battlefield 4 but basically all I'm
saying<00:01:12.470> is<00:01:12.590> that<00:01:12.770> if<00:01:13.040> you<00:01:13.159> hang<00:01:13.430> out<00:01:13.580> with<00:01:13.640> the

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:13.940 
saying is that if you hang out with the

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:17.170 
saying is that if you hang out with the
negative<00:01:14.650> eventually<00:01:15.650> you<00:01:16.340> become<00:01:16.520> negative

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:17.180 
negative eventually you become negative

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:19.149 
negative eventually you become negative
