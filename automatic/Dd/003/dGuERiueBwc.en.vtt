Little Giant Ladder the classic Little
Giant<00:00:14.660> Ladder<00:00:14.690> in<00:00:15.080> that<00:00:15.769> it's<00:00:16.129> just<00:00:16.490> a

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:16.609 
Giant Ladder in that it's just a

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:20.229 
Giant Ladder in that it's just a
telescoping<00:00:17.359> a-frame<00:00:18.109> ladder<00:00:18.789> and<00:00:19.789> by<00:00:19.999> that<00:00:20.210> I

00:00:20.229 --> 00:00:20.239 
telescoping a-frame ladder and by that I

00:00:20.239 --> 00:00:22.479 
telescoping a-frame ladder and by that I
mean<00:00:20.449> it<00:00:20.630> does<00:00:20.839> not<00:00:21.019> open<00:00:21.349> straight<00:00:21.739> as<00:00:21.980> an

00:00:22.479 --> 00:00:22.489 
mean it does not open straight as an

00:00:22.489 --> 00:00:25.059 
mean it does not open straight as an
extension<00:00:22.880> ladder<00:00:23.210> this<00:00:23.869> is<00:00:24.140> great<00:00:24.380> for<00:00:24.710> all

step has a single leg in the back that's
to<00:01:05.990> reduce<00:01:06.290> the<00:01:06.500> weight<00:01:06.679> but<00:01:07.310> down<00:01:07.490> here<00:01:07.520> at

00:01:07.779 --> 00:01:07.789 
to reduce the weight but down here at

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:11.020 
to reduce the weight but down here at
the<00:01:07.969> bottom<00:01:08.299> it<00:01:08.450> is<00:01:08.479> flared<00:01:09.049> for<00:01:09.439> stability
