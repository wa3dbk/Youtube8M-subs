00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:00.239
 after the first stage have filled our 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.949
 goals on the first match since 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:05.369
 will meet our competitor 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:07.979
 live and so on a game a little bit 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.570
 difficult we still get to 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.100
 go out 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.630
 the next day match even harder 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.439
 against chambly 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:18.690
 there we put everything back flat and we see a 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:23.009
 little what we worked for for the 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:26.550
 continuation and for the second step a 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.990
 started in 1997 at aramon on a tournament 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:30.330
 which was called 20 years of the horse ball 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.729
 from that moment on I started to 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:35.670
 play as young people in 98 I did my 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.490
 first lamotte beuvron and then all one 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.409
 circuit I have a good memory with 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:42.799
 the team of aramon in 2003 on a cut 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:46.140
 of France where I played with 

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:47.490
 joel cyrille melchior and felt it 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.770
 that they were with me today who 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.330
 players and me currently 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.170
 Then I went to play for a 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:55.619
 year in arles 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.179
 always to play with my friends from there 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.550
 I stopped for two years for the 

00:01:57.179 --> 00:02:01.530
 work I spent a few few 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:03.539
 diplomas in the horse trades for 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.789
 finish then to take off again 

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:10.319
 with the bellegarde club and I attack 

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:11.730
 my fifth year with them then my 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:14.849
 horse is pacha damage fishing 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:17.280
 hunt and I rattle that I got back and has 

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:18.180
 out of the races at the age of 8 this is 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.610
 a horse that was doing a lot of 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:23.790
 races to found the 3000 and 4000 m 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:26.580
 it's a horse that has the abilities that 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.500
 has the qualities of easily holding 20 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:31.440
 minutes of match and it's a horse that 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:33.540
 is fast and is starting to become 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.440
 handy he still has a little flaw he 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.440
 has a lot of strength 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.090
 suddenly 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:41.080
 to force a little bit of composing 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:44.260
 my game without big advantage is his 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:47.140
 stability and thanks to that I can when 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.400
 even be a little more comfortable compared to 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:50.200
 my old horse who was holy 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.880
 laurent who was much more manageable 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:56.980
 and fast but I felt a lot 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:58.510
 less comfortable on it then my team 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:01.300
 in three words I would first say a 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:01.810
 band of colleagues is very close in 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:03.820
 is very close 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.110
 in the game we are especially very 

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:08.080
 close to the field one is 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:11.590
 really we win a little bit but 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:14.290
 we are really friends the second thing 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:17.170
 I would say that we are always in solidarity 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:18.760
 in this idea of ​​the team we can 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:21.730
 service center even when it's not 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:24.700
 in question of horse ball and and we 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:26.830
 still the ease of 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:28.510
 find on the ground in a 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:29.980
 certain usability and this 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:31.660
 solidarity we really start to 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:33.730
 find on the ground we start at the 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:34.930
 find in match and to finish I would say 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:37.330
 that it's a swinging team 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:39.760
 because here we have we really want 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:43.209
 to do something about this season 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:47.850
 we're coming back from a pro season and we 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:47.850
 would like to maintain this elite place 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:54.340
 so my favorite player on the 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:58.450
 last season it's the player who has 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:04:01.780
 was finally elected to jardy for this start 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:03.640
 of season I would say that the players that 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:04.930
 I was waiting are not really really 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:06.670
 at the appointment I did not have time to 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:08.110
 see all the matches on those on this 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:11.489
 first step then i'm waiting for the 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:11.489
 second step to pronounce
