 they requested it several times through 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.410
 the different social networks then 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.550

 to accompany us again in the

 hatchery outside any that yesterday to 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.130
 we are very important to be with 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.050
 you in the Julian program please 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.790
 let's remind viewers 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.980
 what genetic lines accompany almost 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.840
 skin riding good eye health is almost that 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.570
 he never told them from home that here the blanket 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.579
 out of contest in dulcinea like 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.200
 we know that it stays face blanket is a 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.719
 very representative player that 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.190
 unfortunately, this 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.780
 horse nationally leaves you a 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.059
 very important legacy that has been seen 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.609
 reflected both in their offspring and being 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.960
 maternal and paternal grandfather good we are going to 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.690
 luisa now I want to talk about mom 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.159
 It is almost oral called dulcinea this 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.390
 Mare made a competitive race 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.120
 interesting already 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.340
 obtained from 4 to 5 best in process in 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:14.550
 the fairs and was champion three times and 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.200
 in 69 was champion four times 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:19.260
 version and you want to accompany a very race 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.030
 pretty she is the daughter of paganini that 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:23.400
 you know is the son of mourning in a 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:26.070
 extraordinary mare called the 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:29.729
 tongolele out of contest in trot and 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:31.140
 gallop and here also hollow you is very 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.630
 important to note that all the 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.700
 genealogy that accompanies almost that the 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:39.270
 juncal has been important both in 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:41.369
 pieces as in reproduction with juliana 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.800
 Well, as I said it is if you have a race 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:46.590
 very nice that that horse we see in the 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:48.360
 maternal part twice a duel that stops 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.130
 I am one of the best grandparents there 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.630
 next to helmsman next to this one I 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.789
 the orange trees but next to several 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.840
 representative examples that have been 

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:56.850
 highlighted not only in the part 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.700
 reproductive but also very 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:02.190
 important as grandparents that copy what 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.720
 we have seen lately since in 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:06.479
 competition not in the path has not 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:08.399
 been very long but but good we go for 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:10.259
 Please tell the viewers what 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.000
 has been this competitive part of almost 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.320
 the boom sing and jose luis 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.660
 although almost never the casino has 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:17.100
 come out to tracks we are working very 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:20.010
 hard on him to get the most 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:21.840
 potential however we have taken it out on 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.360
 some important equine exhibitions 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.760
 where he has always been on the scoreboard 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.920
 in the last one that participated in the cup of 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.769
 the santanderes where it was great champion 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.390
 reserved Jose Luis we are working 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:34.829
 very hard with almost that the juncal for 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.230
 correct some things that we should 

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:39.360
 have so that next year it comes out 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.459
 the clues nationwide people 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:44.050
 You can see the potential of the 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:45.730
 horse live and live 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:47.800
 good as you have been able to give an account 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.870
 in the images this is a horse in 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:52.480
 the exquisite movements not a trail 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:55.210
 very good very good speed 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:57.970
 tread a very nice phenotype because 

00:02:55.210 --> 00:03:00.370
 draws attention to only see it by 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:01.900
 Please Julian, let's mention these 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:04.030
 virtues that the horse has both 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:06.490
 its phenotype as in its mechanics in its 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:08.680
 blind displacement you know that makes 

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:11.470
 Some fit highlights for its speed by 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:13.270
 its tread by its color and its cold 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:15.670
 that even though it's a horse with 

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:17.560
 very temperament he behaves very 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:19.600
 well on the tracks I want to emphasize that 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:21.910
 they have never made it repeat a step 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:23.440
 the track lasts because it is very defined in 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:26.050
 his walk because the trail outside 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:28.060
 Colombian now how can you 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:30.430
 realize is the only son of almost 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:31.990
 that to each black blanket or so 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:34.540
 less than the only one that we 

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:35.950
 we know therefore we know that the 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.410
 genes in their color are very dominant 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:40.600
 We have seen this reflected in 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:43.780
 their offspring although they are few because the 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:45.760
 horse is very young we see in his 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:47.980
 phenotype that is a very nice horse 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:50.920
 with very good elevation and that their lines of 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:52.840
 aplomb are very correct to finalize 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:54.550
 José Luis, I want to tell you that we have already 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:56.800
 seen several casey cities that the 

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:58.540
 Juncal are very well moved screens 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:00.880
 and of very good color since they took the 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:02.920
 Same house color in the part 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:05.230
 reproductive of the horse we are very 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:06.550
 calm because the down gave me a 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:08.020
 excellent quality 

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:09.970
 Julian thank you very much for having us 

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:13.030
 attended again here in the hatchery 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:14.890
 of the lupe as they could see it is a 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:16.209
 and also the only copy I know 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:18.430
 I the only son of almost that of 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:20.380
 caramanta of that color with many 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:23.410
 qualities in their movements a line 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:25.870
 of very attractive genetics and good we 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:27.460
 we see in another opportunity thank you very much 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:29.500
 José Luís for coming to the farm 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:30.380
 I hope you liked our 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:32.030
 new player 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:33.770
 It's almost like the juncal and as I 've 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:35.969
 repeated on other occasions the doors 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:38.479
 to create or they will always be open 

00:04:35.969 --> 00:04:38.479
 ah
