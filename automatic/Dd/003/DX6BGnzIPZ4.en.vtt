00:00:06.249 --> 00:00:06.259 
alright guys back to this table the my

00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:09.549 
alright guys back to this table the my
next<00:00:06.470> step<00:00:06.740> I'm<00:00:07.009> going<00:00:07.669> to<00:00:07.850> build<00:00:08.389> a<00:00:08.840> skirt

00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:09.559 
next step I'm going to build a skirt

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:15.579 
next step I'm going to build a skirt
that<00:00:09.860> goes<00:00:10.400> around<00:00:10.639> that<00:00:11.290> table<00:00:12.290> so<00:00:14.170> so<00:00:15.170> the

00:00:15.579 --> 00:00:15.589 
that goes around that table so so the

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:18.840 
that goes around that table so so the
front<00:00:16.040> of<00:00:16.129> it<00:00:16.280> just<00:00:16.580> a<00:00:17.240> little<00:00:17.420> bit<00:00:17.540> of<00:00:17.600> skirt

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:18.850 
front of it just a little bit of skirt

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:25.990 
front of it just a little bit of skirt
two<00:00:19.850> and<00:00:20.000> a<00:00:20.030> quarter<00:00:20.150> inches<00:00:20.630> the<00:00:24.850> that<00:00:25.850> way<00:00:25.970> I

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:26.000 
two and a quarter inches the that way I

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.990 
two and a quarter inches the that way I
can<00:00:26.360> mount<00:00:27.880> what<00:00:28.880> I'm<00:00:28.970> thinking<00:00:29.330> is<00:00:29.510> mounting

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:31.000 
can mount what I'm thinking is mounting

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.030 
can mount what I'm thinking is mounting
five<00:00:32.000> legs<00:00:32.800> one<00:00:33.800> over<00:00:34.040> here<00:00:34.840> one<00:00:35.840> there<00:00:36.080> one<00:00:36.920> in

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:37.040 
five legs one over here one there one in

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:41.740 
five legs one over here one there one in
the<00:00:37.100> center<00:00:37.670> of<00:00:37.880> the<00:00:38.540> front<00:00:39.190> one<00:00:40.190> at<00:00:40.370> this<00:00:40.750> part

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:41.750 
the center of the front one at this part

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:48.640 
the center of the front one at this part
and<00:00:42.350> one<00:00:42.560> up<00:00:42.830> here<00:00:43.190> so<00:00:44.180> this<00:00:44.540> is<00:00:44.690> my<00:00:44.720> next<00:00:45.020> step

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:48.650 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:51.190 

all<00:00:49.220> right<00:00:49.370> my<00:00:49.880> next<00:00:50.150> step<00:00:50.300> on<00:00:50.510> that<00:00:50.690> table<00:00:50.900> I'm

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:51.200 
all right my next step on that table I'm

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.340 
all right my next step on that table I'm
building<00:00:51.890> the<00:00:51.980> skirt<00:00:52.340> that<00:00:52.760> goes<00:00:53.140> around<00:00:54.140> the

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:54.350 
building the skirt that goes around the

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:57.220 
building the skirt that goes around the
front<00:00:54.620> of<00:00:54.830> it<00:00:54.980> and<00:00:55.100> I<00:00:56.030> have<00:00:56.210> a<00:00:56.270> piece<00:00:56.450> of<00:00:56.660> select

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:57.230 
front of it and I have a piece of select

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:01.210 
front of it and I have a piece of select
pine<00:00:57.470> no<00:00:58.040> knots<00:00:58.280> in<00:00:58.520> it<00:00:58.670> and<00:00:58.850> I<00:00:59.840> would<00:01:00.290> resaw<00:01:01.010> it

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:01.220 
pine no knots in it and I would resaw it

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:05.830 
pine no knots in it and I would resaw it
on<00:01:01.400> a<00:01:01.430> bandsaw<00:01:02.270> but<00:01:02.900> I<00:01:03.140> don't<00:01:03.410> have<00:01:03.560> one<00:01:03.800> so<00:01:04.840> my

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:05.840 
on a bandsaw but I don't have one so my

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.490 
on a bandsaw but I don't have one so my
next<00:01:06.020> step<00:01:06.170> is<00:01:06.530> I'm<00:01:06.740> going<00:01:06.980> to<00:01:07.130> use<00:01:08.170> my<00:01:09.170> table

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:09.500 
next step is I'm going to use my table

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.790 
next step is I'm going to use my table
saw<00:01:09.650> and<00:01:09.920> I'm<00:01:10.520> hope<00:01:11.090> I'm<00:01:11.330> hoping<00:01:11.810> I<00:01:11.960> can<00:01:11.990> get<00:01:12.410> at

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:12.800 
saw and I'm hope I'm hoping I can get at

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:16.810 
saw and I'm hope I'm hoping I can get at
least<00:01:13.280> two<00:01:13.850> pieces<00:01:14.060> or<00:01:15.310> maybe<00:01:16.310> three<00:01:16.610> pieces

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:16.820 
least two pieces or maybe three pieces

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:21.340 
least two pieces or maybe three pieces
out<00:01:17.390> of<00:01:17.960> this<00:01:18.850> because<00:01:19.850> it's<00:01:20.030> going<00:01:20.150> to<00:01:20.350> curve

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.350 
out of this because it's going to curve

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:28.150 
out of this because it's going to curve
I<00:01:23.500> want<00:01:24.500> it<00:01:24.590> to<00:01:25.540> be<00:01:26.540> thin<00:01:26.990> and<00:01:27.229> I'll<00:01:27.740> glue<00:01:28.040> the

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:28.160 
I want it to be thin and I'll glue the

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.280 
I want it to be thin and I'll glue the
pieces<00:01:28.340> together<00:01:28.640> and<00:01:29.030> then<00:01:29.420> the<00:01:29.540> outside<00:01:30.050> of

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:30.290 
pieces together and then the outside of

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:34.810 
pieces together and then the outside of
it<00:01:30.470> I'll<00:01:31.340> either<00:01:31.520> cut<00:01:32.090> a<00:01:32.119> piece<00:01:32.360> of<00:01:33.820> cherry

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:34.820 
it I'll either cut a piece of cherry

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:38.190 
it I'll either cut a piece of cherry
that<00:01:35.060> I<00:01:35.119> have<00:01:35.420> or<00:01:35.810> use<00:01:36.440> the<00:01:36.710> cherry<00:01:37.400> veneer<00:01:37.820> and

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:38.200 
that I have or use the cherry veneer and

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.990 
that I have or use the cherry veneer and
I<00:01:39.200> might<00:01:39.410> use<00:01:39.590> the<00:01:39.710> cherry<00:01:40.010> veneer<00:01:40.280> just<00:01:40.880> so<00:01:40.970> I

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
I might use the cherry veneer just so I

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.510 
I might use the cherry veneer just so I
can<00:01:41.270> show<00:01:41.420> you<00:01:41.479> all<00:01:43.090> that<00:01:44.260> but<00:01:45.280> we'll<00:01:46.280> go<00:01:46.430> ahead

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:46.520 
can show you all that but we'll go ahead

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:47.290 
can show you all that but we'll go ahead
and<00:01:46.729> get<00:01:46.910> started

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:47.300 
and get started

00:01:47.300 --> 00:03:06.710 
and get started
let<00:01:47.479> me<00:01:47.540> get<00:01:47.660> my<00:01:47.750> earmuffs

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.160

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
now that I got one side done and it

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:14.330 
now that I got one side done and it
matches<00:03:10.410> here<00:03:11.300> I'm<00:03:12.300> going<00:03:12.960> to<00:03:13.290> since<00:03:13.680> the

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
matches here I'm going to since the

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.040 
matches here I'm going to since the
other<00:03:14.490> side<00:03:14.760> is<00:03:14.940> the<00:03:15.180> square<00:03:15.390> side<00:03:15.780> I'm<00:03:15.900> going

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:16.050 
other side is the square side I'm going

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:21.410 
other side is the square side I'm going
to<00:03:16.170> flip<00:03:16.680> this<00:03:19.280> Thanks<00:03:20.310> this<00:03:20.820> side<00:03:21.030> is<00:03:21.210> square

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
to flip this Thanks this side is square

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.750 
to flip this Thanks this side is square
on<00:03:22.080> this<00:03:22.350> side<00:03:22.530> of<00:03:22.560> square<00:03:22.800> we'll<00:03:23.400> flip<00:03:23.640> it

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
on this side of square we'll flip it

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.700 
on this side of square we'll flip it
over<00:03:23.910> and<00:03:24.060> we<00:03:24.720> saw<00:03:24.900> it<00:03:24.960> this<00:03:25.110> way<00:03:25.320> and<00:03:25.530> then

I'll run it through my planer to make

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:46.729 
I'll run it through my planer to make
them<00:03:30.810> all<00:03:31.320> even
