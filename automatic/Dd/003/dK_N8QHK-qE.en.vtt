 severe pressure

 Ukraine in general did not count with us I 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.699
 I think that the referendum would tell all 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:20.010
 to their seats and we return our 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.990

 preparation is already in full swing of power 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.039

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.560

 Crimea referendum say no teachers 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.670
 words lessons cannot be politicized but 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.410
 students should know then and how Crimea 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.780
 was attached to Ukraine what is 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.940
 autonomy and of course this is what the Crimea 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:03.570
 have their own constitution and Crimeans 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.840

 current Ukrainian legislation 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.500
 Sevastopol on a par with the capital of Kiev 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.950
 has a special city status 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.180
 national significance decision 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.610
 which adopted the Crimean Parliament 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.229
 reported to Vladimir Putin a little later 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.540
 Kremlin press service reported that 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:39.060
 the president discussed the situation in Ukraine 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.439
 including news from Simferopol with 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.829

 deputies of the State Duma and the Supreme Council 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:57.930
 Crimea, his delegation was still waiting today 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.450
 but parliamentarians are just at this time 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.399
 discussed the decision on the timing of the broadcast 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.140
 home and issues 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:06.030
 experts meanwhile are sorting 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.980
 arguments that lead to the Crimean 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.290
 autonomy in favor of self determination 

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:13.020
 in Kiev against him will continue Dmitri 

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:14.760
 Kochetkov Supreme Council of Crimea announcing 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:17.190
 Crimea Council announced entry into 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.200
 The composition of the Russian referendum is absolutely 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:22.440
 legitimate authority consists of several 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:24.510
 factions elected back in 2010 for five years in 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.680
 full compliance with the laws of Ukraine and 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.840
 Crimean autonomy 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.920
 these are obvious facts to argue with which 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.260
 impossible at all 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.970
 European officials found another 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.960
 argument as the representative says 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:38.700
 European Union in Ukraine, Yan Tombinsky 

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:41.430
 issues of separation of the Crimea can be resolved 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.620
 only in a national referendum on 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:46.020
 This says Article 73 of the Constitution 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.090
 Ukraine but experts say 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:50.240
 Crimean deputies have every right 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:52.290
 decide self determination 

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:54.300
 legal grounds to accept such 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.140
 to the bus to the Crimean deputies as a matter of fact gave 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.850
 euromaidan 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:59.070
 he formed the Ukrainian government 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:01.470
 which the west recognized reality legitimate 

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:04.170
 and now any decision made on the street 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:06.990
 in Ukraine can be considered legitimate on 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:08.130
 referendum supreme council of the people of Crimea 

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:10.740
 can bear 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:13.980
 any question they see fit 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:17.450
 and the answer to the referendum is the answer on this 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:20.610
 the referendum will be further well some 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:23.100
 roadmap to address the rest 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:26.100
 question decision of the Supreme Council of Crimea 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:29.310
 about the approach of dates 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:31.820
 referendum absolutely correct this 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:34.350
 the decision will not give the opportunity 

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:37.080
 interested forces to organize 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:38.940
 provocations for disrupting the referendum we are 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:41.250
 Kiev referendum is not recognized here 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.600
 insist on strict observance of the letter 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:45.330
 its basic law 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:47.730
 days of random this referendum is 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:50.010
 unconstitutional we need to return 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:51.810
 discussion in the legal field there are many 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:53.810
 scenarios but no 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:55.830
 meaning now discuss initially 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:57.110
 unconstitutional 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:59.430
 one that is strictly enforced 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:01.050
 constitutions spoke in the country in 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:02.190
 which actually occurred 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:04.620
 coup d'Ã©tat 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:06.690
 action films throwing golden eagle cocktails 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:09.510
 Molotov police shot 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:11.940
 imbibed heads of regional administrations and 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:14.400
 seize administrative buildings about 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:16.500
 the constitution for some reason did not remember not 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:19.260
 Dula with people of the basic law of Ukraine 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:20.519
 deputies of the Supreme Rada elected 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.740
 acting president 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:24.000
 alexander turchinova with live 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:26.000
 President Yanukovych 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.020
 although all in the same constitution of Ukraine 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.510
 clearly stated about the three ways 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:32.550
 removing the president from power is 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:34.500
 death personal statement or impeachment 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:36.570
 as we know none of the above on 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:38.540
 happened by the way so that in legality 

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:40.800
 decisions of the new government no one doubted 

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:43.740
 constitutional court in Ukraine in general 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:49.020
 dispersed ex judges frighten criminal 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:51.870
 affairs in Kiev revolution bard house 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:55.800
 no power of lawlessness 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:05:00.000
 killing violence such conditions people 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:02.730
 In trouble is people experiencing tyranny 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.970
 the most difficult situation who will rise on 

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:09.570
 protection of Russians and Ukrainians at this time 

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:12.590
 there is no legitimate president 

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:15.050
 repent from outside Ukraine 

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:18.090
 impostors try to seize power 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:21.060
 so of course I think that 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:23.460
 March 16 will be a holiday for Crimeans 

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:28.830
 people are too fresh 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:31.800
 the sensations of the pogroms of violence murders to all and 

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:33.660
 in Russia, too, expects that they will earn there 

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:36.270
 international observers and we will get 

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:38.190
 answers who did it for what it was 

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:38.790
 walls nothing needed so high 

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:43.080
 price 

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:45.600
 a dozen lives of people in the name of what and who 

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:47.970
 Now it is still there and who renders 

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:50.520
 pressure that's all acts just 

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:52.800
 him the population of the Crimea who wants both 

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:56.610
 get to safe as soon as possible 

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:58.740
 space safe diction russia 

00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:00.210
 strange logic when the opposition with 

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:02.430
 using the far-right militants 

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:04.949
 seizes the power to break the constitution 

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:06.750
 possible and when after a revolt in the capital 

00:06:04.949 --> 00:06:09.210
 one of the regions wants to identify itself 

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:11.909
 already can not deviate from it either to the letter 

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:14.250
 in the Crimea would such a logic do not want to live on 

00:06:11.909 --> 00:06:17.729
 Ukraine now largely goes 

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:20.340
 process 0 such legal creativity 

00:06:17.729 --> 00:06:23.280
 Now I am talking about saying 

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:26.580
 certain political will different 

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:28.939
 regions of Ukraine and kelly in how would he not 

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:32.689
 I wanted to consider it illegitimate and 

00:06:28.939 --> 00:06:32.689
 unconstitutional obliged
