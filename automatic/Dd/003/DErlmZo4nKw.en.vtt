Anthony<00:00:13.710> what<00:00:14.160> do<00:00:14.219> you<00:00:14.309> think<00:00:14.580> about<00:00:14.700> this<00:00:15.059> new

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
Anthony what do you think about this new

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.029 
Anthony what do you think about this new
theory<00:00:16.049> that<00:00:16.199> has<00:00:16.590> popped<00:00:16.830> up<00:00:17.100> I<00:00:17.570> think<00:00:19.039> and

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
theory that has popped up I think and

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.859 
theory that has popped up I think and
the<00:00:20.369> reason<00:00:20.730> I<00:00:21.000> think<00:00:22.220> is<00:00:23.220> because<00:00:24.029> I<00:00:24.750> think

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
the reason I think is because I think

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.370 
the reason I think is because I think
that<00:00:25.199> Star<00:00:25.859> Wars<00:00:26.160> at<00:00:26.460> its<00:00:26.640> core<00:00:27.000> should<00:00:27.330> be<00:00:27.960> the

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
that Star Wars at its core should be the

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.880 
that Star Wars at its core should be the
story<00:00:28.890> of<00:00:29.250> the<00:00:29.550> Skywalker's<00:00:30.359> and<00:00:30.590> I'm<00:00:31.590> not

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
story of the Skywalker's and I'm not

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.260 
story of the Skywalker's and I'm not
saying<00:00:32.189> we're<00:00:32.340> gonna<00:00:32.399> find<00:00:32.790> this<00:00:32.969> out<00:00:33.120> in

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
saying we're gonna find this out in

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:34.549 
saying we're gonna find this out in
Episode<00:00:33.630> seven<00:00:33.870> I<00:00:33.960> don't<00:00:34.110> think<00:00:34.290> we're<00:00:34.440> gonna

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
Episode seven I don't think we're gonna

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.610 
Episode seven I don't think we're gonna
find<00:00:34.770> it<00:00:34.950> out<00:00:35.010> for<00:00:35.700> like<00:00:35.910> a<00:00:35.940> couple<00:00:36.180> years<00:00:36.620> at

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
find it out for like a couple years at

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.639 
find it out for like a couple years at
least<00:00:37.890> until<00:00:38.129> episode<00:00:38.250> eight<00:00:39.379> but<00:00:40.379> I<00:00:40.440> think

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
least until episode eight but I think

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.250 
least until episode eight but I think
there's<00:00:40.800> gonna<00:00:40.950> be<00:00:41.010> a<00:00:41.160> reveal<00:00:41.989> that<00:00:42.989> they're

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
there's gonna be a reveal that they're

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.139 
there's gonna be a reveal that they're
brother<00:00:43.500> and<00:00:43.590> sister<00:00:43.739> and<00:00:44.280> that<00:00:44.820> she's

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
brother and sister and that she's

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.529 
brother and sister and that she's
actually<00:00:45.360> a<00:00:45.600> Skywalker<00:00:46.170> and<00:00:47.329> that<00:00:48.329> could

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
actually a Skywalker and that could

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:49.910 
actually a Skywalker and that could
further<00:00:48.719> the<00:00:49.020> story<00:00:49.260> because<00:00:49.590> I<00:00:49.680> don't<00:00:49.829> think

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
further the story because I don't think

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.180 
further the story because I don't think
that<00:00:50.210> the<00:00:51.210> this<00:00:52.020> story<00:00:52.320> of<00:00:52.590> this<00:00:52.770> new<00:00:52.920> trilogy

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
that the this story of this new trilogy

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.029 
that the this story of this new trilogy
is<00:00:53.550> gonna<00:00:53.760> focus<00:00:54.030> on<00:00:54.539> the<00:00:55.020> original<00:00:55.410> cast<00:00:55.680> I

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
is gonna focus on the original cast I

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.110 
is gonna focus on the original cast I
think<00:00:56.910> their<00:00:57.120> job<00:00:57.149> is<00:00:57.690> to<00:00:58.609> push<00:00:59.609> the<00:00:59.640> story

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
think their job is to push the story

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.200 
think their job is to push the story
forward<00:01:00.210> and<00:01:00.870> then<00:01:01.140> kind<00:01:01.440> of<00:01:01.590> just<00:01:01.859> get<00:01:02.010> out

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.210 
forward and then kind of just get out

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:05.840 
forward and then kind of just get out
you<00:01:03.210> know<00:01:03.329> what<00:01:03.420> I<00:01:03.480> mean<00:01:03.690> so<00:01:04.589> I<00:01:04.619> think<00:01:04.769> that<00:01:05.100> it

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
you know what I mean so I think that it

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.780 
you know what I mean so I think that it
would<00:01:05.970> make<00:01:06.180> sense<00:01:06.570> to<00:01:07.080> you<00:01:07.710> know<00:01:07.799> find<00:01:08.520> a<00:01:08.640> way

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
would make sense to you know find a way

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.670 
would make sense to you know find a way
to<00:01:08.850> further<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.600> story<00:01:09.869> of<00:01:09.960> the<00:01:10.049> stepmothers

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
to further the story of the stepmothers

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.730 
to further the story of the stepmothers
so<00:01:11.640> when<00:01:12.000> you<00:01:12.150> say<00:01:12.390> they<00:01:13.020> could<00:01:13.200> Skywalker

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
so when you say they could Skywalker

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.870 
so when you say they could Skywalker
which<00:01:14.070> Skywalker<00:01:14.670> are<00:01:15.210> you<00:01:15.450> referring<00:01:15.960> to<00:01:16.170> I

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:16.880 
which Skywalker are you referring to I

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:22.390 
which Skywalker are you referring to I
assume<00:01:17.880> that<00:01:17.909> they're<00:01:18.720> gonna<00:01:19.020> be<00:01:19.259> lay<00:01:19.650> as<00:01:19.710> kids

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:22.400 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.749 

which<00:01:23.400> would<00:01:23.640> be<00:01:23.790> fine<00:01:24.060> you<00:01:24.540> know<00:01:25.549> it's<00:01:26.549> the

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
which would be fine you know it's the

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.010 
which would be fine you know it's the
same<00:01:26.939> bloodline<00:01:27.210> they<00:01:27.509> don't<00:01:27.659> have<00:01:27.780> to<00:01:27.900> be

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
same bloodline they don't have to be

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.440 
same bloodline they don't have to be
directly<00:01:28.670> like<00:01:29.670> they<00:01:29.820> don't<00:01:29.970> have<00:01:30.090> to<00:01:30.210> be<00:01:30.299> the

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
directly like they don't have to be the

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.319 
directly like they don't have to be the
offspring<00:01:30.600> of<00:01:31.280> Luke<00:01:32.280> Skywalker<00:01:32.820> because<00:01:33.240> I

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
offspring of Luke Skywalker because I

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.390 
offspring of Luke Skywalker because I
don't<00:01:33.479> think<00:01:33.540> that<00:01:33.840> he<00:01:34.110> will<00:01:34.920> really<00:01:35.159> ever

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
don't think that he will really ever

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.380 
don't think that he will really ever
have<00:01:35.670> kids<00:01:36.000> it<00:01:36.720> doesn't<00:01:37.049> look<00:01:37.200> like<00:01:37.380> he's<00:01:38.390> you

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
have kids it doesn't look like he's you

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.600 
have kids it doesn't look like he's you
know<00:01:39.420> in<00:01:39.840> a<00:01:40.049> position<00:01:40.380> where<00:01:41.100> he's<00:01:41.250> like<00:01:41.369> in<00:01:41.520> a

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
know in a position where he's like in a

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.679 
know in a position where he's like in a
happy<00:01:41.939> marriage<00:01:42.899> or<00:01:43.350> something<00:01:43.860> or<00:01:44.189> you<00:01:44.850> know

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
happy marriage or something or you know

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.410 
happy marriage or something or you know
it<00:01:46.380> it<00:01:47.040> just<00:01:47.250> seems<00:01:47.460> like<00:01:47.670> he's<00:01:47.909> kind<00:01:47.939> of<00:01:48.270> been

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
it it just seems like he's kind of been

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.980 
it it just seems like he's kind of been
on<00:01:48.570> his<00:01:48.689> own<00:01:49.549> but<00:01:50.549> I<00:01:50.850> think<00:01:51.210> that<00:01:51.420> they're

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
on his own but I think that they're

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.499 
on his own but I think that they're
gonna<00:01:52.170> do<00:01:52.409> something<00:01:52.770> with<00:01:53.070> Han<00:01:53.970> and<00:01:54.299> Leia

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
gonna do something with Han and Leia

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.139 
gonna do something with Han and Leia
having<00:01:55.350> kids<00:01:55.649> maybe<00:01:56.549> they're<00:01:56.790> not<00:01:56.939> together

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
having kids maybe they're not together

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:01.100 
having kids maybe they're not together
anymore<00:01:57.689> but<00:01:58.200> maybe<00:01:58.380> they<00:01:58.649> work<00:01:58.860> it's<00:02:00.110> maybe

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
anymore but maybe they work it's maybe

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.950 
anymore but maybe they work it's maybe
they<00:02:01.520> sent<00:02:02.520> their<00:02:02.700> kids<00:02:02.729> away<00:02:03.210> because<00:02:03.689> they

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
they sent their kids away because they

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.289 
they sent their kids away because they
didn't<00:02:04.290> want<00:02:04.469> them<00:02:04.770> to<00:02:05.759> get<00:02:05.909> in<00:02:06.060> any<00:02:06.210> trouble

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
didn't want them to get in any trouble

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:09.859 
didn't want them to get in any trouble
from<00:02:07.020> them<00:02:07.890> I'm<00:02:08.250> not<00:02:08.429> sure<00:02:08.489> you<00:02:08.970> know<00:02:09.119> it's

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
from them I'm not sure you know it's

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.930 
from them I'm not sure you know it's
it's<00:02:10.649> gonna<00:02:10.890> be<00:02:11.099> interesting<00:02:11.340> but<00:02:11.700> like<00:02:11.819> I

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
it's gonna be interesting but like I

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.040 
it's gonna be interesting but like I
said<00:02:12.000> I<00:02:12.150> don't<00:02:12.390> think<00:02:12.569> we're<00:02:12.690> gonna

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
said I don't think we're gonna

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:17.930 
said I don't think we're gonna
now<00:02:14.570> yeah<00:02:15.570> it's<00:02:15.780> kind<00:02:16.020> of<00:02:16.080> like<00:02:16.230> a<00:02:16.940> secret

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
now yeah it's kind of like a secret

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.330 
now yeah it's kind of like a secret
that'll<00:02:18.480> be<00:02:18.600> kept<00:02:18.840> but<00:02:19.500> still<00:02:19.800> in<00:02:19.950> kitchen

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
that'll be kept but still in kitchen

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.240 
that'll be kept but still in kitchen
it's<00:02:20.610> also<00:02:20.910> it<00:02:21.390> it's<00:02:21.960> kind<00:02:22.560> of<00:02:22.710> taking<00:02:23.100> from

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
it's also it it's kind of taking from

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.040 
it's also it it's kind of taking from
the<00:02:23.430> original<00:02:23.820> trilogy<00:02:24.000> to<00:02:24.420> because<00:02:24.810> they

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
the original trilogy to because they

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:29.120 
the original trilogy to because they
never<00:02:26.240> you<00:02:27.240> know<00:02:27.330> told<00:02:27.660> you<00:02:27.780> that<00:02:27.960> until<00:02:28.350> what

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
never you know told you that until what

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:32.600 
never you know told you that until what
was<00:02:29.280> it<00:02:29.400> sixth<00:02:29.730> movie<00:02:30.030> yet<00:02:30.240> so<00:02:31.250> told<00:02:32.250> you<00:02:32.370> did<00:02:32.580> I

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
was it sixth movie yet so told you did I

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:39.010 
was it sixth movie yet so told you did I
do<00:02:33.230> that<00:02:35.420> means<00:02:37.340> until<00:02:38.340> Return<00:02:38.640> of<00:02:38.670> the<00:02:38.790> Jedi

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:39.020 
do that means until Return of the Jedi

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:42.740 
do that means until Return of the Jedi
so<00:02:40.020> I<00:02:40.380> think<00:02:40.530> that<00:02:40.950> in<00:02:41.460> some<00:02:42.030> ways<00:02:42.240> they're

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
so I think that in some ways they're

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.640 
so I think that in some ways they're
trying<00:02:43.080> to<00:02:44.540> you<00:02:45.540> know<00:02:45.570> kind<00:02:45.990> of<00:02:46.110> capture<00:02:46.620> the

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
trying to you know kind of capture the

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.800 
trying to you know kind of capture the
feel<00:02:47.100> of<00:02:47.130> the<00:02:47.490> original<00:02:47.610> trilogy<00:02:48.150> and<00:02:48.450> I<00:02:48.600> think

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
feel of the original trilogy and I think

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.030 
feel of the original trilogy and I think
that<00:02:48.990> would<00:02:49.110> be<00:02:49.260> one<00:02:49.410> of<00:02:49.500> the<00:02:49.560> ways<00:02:49.710> to<00:02:49.740> do<00:02:50.010> it

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
that would be one of the ways to do it

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.460 
that would be one of the ways to do it
is<00:02:50.360> to<00:02:51.360> kind<00:02:51.510> of<00:02:51.660> have<00:02:51.750> this<00:02:51.870> reveal<00:02:52.200> of

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
is to kind of have this reveal of

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:53.840 
is to kind of have this reveal of
although<00:02:52.830> they<00:02:53.010> were<00:02:53.130> actually<00:02:53.580> in<00:02:53.610> the

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
although they were actually in the

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:57.230 
although they were actually in the
bloodline<00:02:54.200> but<00:02:55.200> nobody<00:02:55.740> ever<00:02:55.920> knew<00:02:56.160> you<00:02:57.120> know

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:57.240 
bloodline but nobody ever knew you know

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:00.620 
bloodline but nobody ever knew you know
that<00:02:57.510> would<00:02:57.780> be<00:02:57.900> pretty<00:02:58.620> cool<00:02:59.240> yeah<00:03:00.240> I<00:03:00.270> mean

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
that would be pretty cool yeah I mean

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:04.100 
that would be pretty cool yeah I mean
that<00:03:01.560> could<00:03:02.190> work<00:03:02.400> well<00:03:02.670> I'm<00:03:03.420> gonna<00:03:03.660> kind<00:03:04.020> of

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
that could work well I'm gonna kind of

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:05.870 
that could work well I'm gonna kind of
play<00:03:04.290> devil's<00:03:04.500> advocate<00:03:04.770> here<00:03:05.430> and<00:03:05.580> I'm<00:03:05.670> gonna

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
play devil's advocate here and I'm gonna

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:07.520 
play devil's advocate here and I'm gonna
say<00:03:06.060> that<00:03:06.240> they're<00:03:06.390> not<00:03:06.570> I'm<00:03:06.840> gonna<00:03:07.050> say<00:03:07.290> that

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
say that they're not I'm gonna say that

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:11.540 
say that they're not I'm gonna say that
it's<00:03:07.710> a<00:03:08.480> really<00:03:09.480> I<00:03:09.950> don't<00:03:10.950> want<00:03:11.220> to<00:03:11.310> use<00:03:11.430> the

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:11.550 
it's a really I don't want to use the

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:13.640 
it's a really I don't want to use the
word<00:03:11.700> cliche<00:03:12.360> but<00:03:12.420> I<00:03:12.870> mean<00:03:13.080> it's<00:03:13.230> been<00:03:13.410> done

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
word cliche but I mean it's been done

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:16.850 
word cliche but I mean it's been done
before<00:03:13.860> and<00:03:14.450> maybe<00:03:15.450> we<00:03:15.900> we<00:03:16.530> could<00:03:16.740> see

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 
before and maybe we we could see

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:18.290 
before and maybe we we could see
something<00:03:17.220> a<00:03:17.280> little<00:03:17.489> bit<00:03:17.610> different<00:03:18.060> with

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:18.300 
something a little bit different with

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:21.440 
something a little bit different with
just<00:03:19.110> a<00:03:19.320> bad<00:03:19.500> guy<00:03:19.800> and<00:03:20.100> maybe<00:03:20.400> raise<00:03:20.820> just<00:03:21.209> a

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
just a bad guy and maybe raise just a

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:24.920 
just a bad guy and maybe raise just a
another<00:03:22.370> pre<00:03:23.370> force<00:03:23.700> user<00:03:23.970> if<00:03:24.270> she<00:03:24.450> is<00:03:24.540> a<00:03:24.570> force

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
another pre force user if she is a force

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:26.810 
another pre force user if she is a force
user<00:03:25.110> and<00:03:25.470> then<00:03:25.590> the<00:03:25.739> force<00:03:25.950> awakens<00:03:26.459> in<00:03:26.640> her

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:26.820 
user and then the force awakens in her

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:29.780 
user and then the force awakens in her
and<00:03:27.090> kind<00:03:27.780> of<00:03:27.900> these<00:03:28.140> brand-new<00:03:28.739> children<00:03:29.670> of

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
and kind of these brand-new children of

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:31.190 
and kind of these brand-new children of
the<00:03:29.910> force<00:03:30.209> in<00:03:30.450> a<00:03:30.510> way<00:03:30.630> are<00:03:30.780> coming<00:03:31.080> together

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
the force in a way are coming together

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.560 
the force in a way are coming together
and<00:03:31.830> they<00:03:32.190> don't<00:03:32.370> really<00:03:32.520> have<00:03:32.760> any<00:03:32.820> relation

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:33.570 
and they don't really have any relation

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:37.220 
and they don't really have any relation
to<00:03:33.750> anyone<00:03:34.080> else<00:03:35.420> so<00:03:36.420> I<00:03:36.450> think<00:03:36.570> that<00:03:36.930> could

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
to anyone else so I think that could

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:40.010 
to anyone else so I think that could
work<00:03:37.260> but<00:03:37.739> I<00:03:38.190> mean<00:03:38.940> it's<00:03:39.120> very<00:03:39.330> possible<00:03:39.570> that

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:40.020 
work but I mean it's very possible that

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:43.340 
work but I mean it's very possible that
they<00:03:40.110> could<00:03:40.200> be<00:03:40.350> brother<00:03:40.650> and<00:03:40.739> sister<00:03:42.350> kylo

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:43.350 
they could be brother and sister kylo

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:46.610 
they could be brother and sister kylo
Ren<00:03:43.560> is<00:03:43.709> clearly<00:03:44.010> the<00:03:44.340> older<00:03:44.640> brother<00:03:45.350> if<00:03:46.350> they

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
Ren is clearly the older brother if they

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:49.430 
Ren is clearly the older brother if they
are<00:03:46.800> indeed<00:03:47.130> but<00:03:48.090> it's<00:03:48.330> just<00:03:48.900> interesting<00:03:49.200> the

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
are indeed but it's just interesting the

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:53.270 
are indeed but it's just interesting the
to<00:03:50.100> know<00:03:50.250> like<00:03:51.080> where<00:03:52.080> people<00:03:52.140> end<00:03:52.590> up<00:03:52.739> and<00:03:52.980> um

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
to know like where people end up and um

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.729 
to know like where people end up and um
if<00:03:53.910> they<00:03:54.150> are<00:03:54.330> indeed<00:03:54.660> I'd<00:03:54.900> be<00:03:55.080> or<00:03:55.350> even<00:03:55.440> if

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:55.739 
if they are indeed I'd be or even if

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:57.710 
if they are indeed I'd be or even if
they're<00:03:55.890> not<00:03:56.010> I'm<00:03:56.760> interested<00:03:57.209> to<00:03:57.330> find<00:03:57.480> out

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
they're not I'm interested to find out

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:00.699 
they're not I'm interested to find out
how<00:03:57.930> exactly<00:03:58.440> they<00:03:58.650> got<00:03:58.860> to<00:03:59.070> where<00:03:59.220> they<00:03:59.250> are<00:03:59.400> I

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:00.709 
how exactly they got to where they are I

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:04.610 
how exactly they got to where they are I
mean<00:04:01.709> why<00:04:02.220> is<00:04:02.280> she<00:04:02.670> just<00:04:03.390> the<00:04:03.540> scavenger<00:04:04.380> and

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
mean why is she just the scavenger and

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:08.540 
mean why is she just the scavenger and
why<00:04:04.800> is<00:04:04.860> he<00:04:05.900> basically<00:04:06.900> a<00:04:07.160> agent<00:04:08.160> for<00:04:08.400> the

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:08.550 
why is he basically a agent for the

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:10.340 
why is he basically a agent for the
first<00:04:08.910> order<00:04:09.180> I<00:04:09.480> mean<00:04:09.600> it's<00:04:09.930> gonna<00:04:10.019> be<00:04:10.200> really

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:10.350 
first order I mean it's gonna be really

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:15.670 
first order I mean it's gonna be really
interesting<00:04:10.590> to<00:04:10.860> find<00:04:11.100> this<00:04:11.280> stuff<00:04:11.519> out<00:04:12.170> yeah

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:15.680 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:17.990 

it's<00:04:16.680> not<00:04:16.859> impossible<00:04:17.160> to<00:04:17.430> rule<00:04:17.640> out<00:04:17.820> that

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
it's not impossible to rule out that

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.860 
it's not impossible to rule out that
it's<00:04:18.890> maybe<00:04:19.890> only<00:04:20.040> one<00:04:20.609> of<00:04:20.760> them<00:04:20.880> could<00:04:21.690> be<00:04:21.720> a

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 
it's maybe only one of them could be a

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:23.690 
it's maybe only one of them could be a
Skywalker<00:04:22.470> like<00:04:22.620> maybe<00:04:22.830> Daisy<00:04:23.220> with

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:23.700 
Skywalker like maybe Daisy with

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:26.050 
Skywalker like maybe Daisy with
character<00:04:24.150> right<00:04:24.330> is<00:04:24.810> the<00:04:25.020> Skywalker<00:04:25.440> in<00:04:25.680> the

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:26.060 
character right is the Skywalker in the

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:28.460 
character right is the Skywalker in the
kylo<00:04:27.060> Ren<00:04:27.240> isn't<00:04:27.690> there's<00:04:27.990> a<00:04:28.080> lot<00:04:28.290> of

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:28.470 
kylo Ren isn't there's a lot of

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:32.150 
kylo Ren isn't there's a lot of
different<00:04:29.510> possibilities<00:04:30.560> but<00:04:31.560> I<00:04:31.740> think<00:04:32.040> when

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:32.160 
different possibilities but I think when

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.210 
different possibilities but I think when
it<00:04:32.280> comes<00:04:32.370> to<00:04:32.550> the<00:04:32.610> Star<00:04:32.820> Wars<00:04:33.440> it's<00:04:34.440> a<00:04:34.770> story

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:35.220 
it comes to the Star Wars it's a story

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:39.620 
it comes to the Star Wars it's a story
of<00:04:35.310> kind<00:04:35.670> of<00:04:35.790> like<00:04:35.940> your<00:04:36.900> destiny<00:04:37.590> and<00:04:38.210> I<00:04:39.210> think

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:39.630 
of kind of like your destiny and I think

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:42.050 
of kind of like your destiny and I think
that<00:04:39.870> they're<00:04:40.200> gonna<00:04:40.380> play<00:04:40.680> with<00:04:40.890> that<00:04:41.060> the

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:42.060 
that they're gonna play with that the

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:43.760 
that they're gonna play with that the
whole<00:04:42.210> Skywalker<00:04:42.750> family<00:04:43.200> could<00:04:43.590> be<00:04:43.650> or

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:43.770 
whole Skywalker family could be or

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:07.200 
pretty much covered it I mean it could

pretty much covered it I mean it could
go<00:05:07.350> either<00:05:07.560> way

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:07.860 
go either way

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:10.640 
go either way
really<00:05:08.670> I'd<00:05:08.940> be<00:05:09.120> fine<00:05:09.330> either<00:05:09.540> way<00:05:09.840> yeah<00:05:10.080> but

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:10.650 
really I'd be fine either way yeah but

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:12.620 
really I'd be fine either way yeah but
really<00:05:11.130> Star<00:05:11.340> Wars<00:05:11.550> is<00:05:11.670> a<00:05:11.700> story<00:05:12.090> about<00:05:12.150> family
