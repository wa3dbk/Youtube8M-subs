you're looking at here is way it should

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:16.830 
you're looking at here is way it should
look<00:00:14.950> when<00:00:15.130> it's<00:00:15.280> all<00:00:15.460> done<00:00:15.670> nice<00:00:16.209> even<00:00:16.630> gap

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:16.840 
look when it's all done nice even gap

look when it's all done nice even gap
along<00:00:17.170> the<00:00:17.350> body<00:00:17.560> pulled<00:00:18.310> up<00:00:18.490> tight<00:00:18.699> close<00:00:19.030> to

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:19.210 
along the body pulled up tight close to

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:21.630 
along the body pulled up tight close to
the<00:00:19.300> body<00:00:19.480> a<00:00:19.780> small<00:00:20.410> gap<00:00:20.770> at<00:00:20.800> each<00:00:21.100> end<00:00:21.400> where

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:21.640 
the body a small gap at each end where

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:23.370 
the body a small gap at each end where
the<00:00:21.730> end<00:00:21.880> cap<00:00:22.119> is<00:00:22.150> so<00:00:22.600> there's<00:00:22.750> no<00:00:22.869> contact

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:23.380 
the end cap is so there's no contact

the end cap is so there's no contact
with<00:00:23.530> the<00:00:23.680> body<00:00:24.090> and<00:00:25.090> you<00:00:25.210> will<00:00:25.360> notice<00:00:25.570> in<00:00:25.750> the

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:25.840 
with the body and you will notice in the

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:28.500 
with the body and you will notice in the
front<00:00:26.110> there<00:00:26.590> is<00:00:26.740> a<00:00:26.770> slight<00:00:27.190> larger<00:00:28.090> gap<00:00:28.270> than

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:28.510 
front there is a slight larger gap than

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:29.760 
front there is a slight larger gap than
the<00:00:28.570> rest<00:00:28.750> of<00:00:28.840> the<00:00:28.930> board<00:00:29.170> and<00:00:29.350> that's<00:00:29.470> due<00:00:29.650> to

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:29.770 
the rest of the board and that's due to

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:31.950 
the rest of the board and that's due to
the<00:00:29.800> body<00:00:30.070> shape<00:00:30.430> it<00:00:30.670> turns<00:00:30.880> in<00:00:31.210> and<00:00:31.449> under<00:00:31.810> at

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:31.960 
the body shape it turns in and under at

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:33.930 
the body shape it turns in and under at
that<00:00:32.020> point<00:00:32.529> but<00:00:33.250> this<00:00:33.399> is<00:00:33.460> the<00:00:33.670> way<00:00:33.789> it<00:00:33.879> should

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:33.940 
that point but this is the way it should

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:36.450 
that point but this is the way it should
look<00:00:34.170> now<00:00:35.170> what<00:00:35.379> we're<00:00:35.499> going<00:00:35.589> to<00:00:35.649> do<00:00:35.859> is<00:00:36.069> show

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:36.460 
look now what we're going to do is show

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:38.250 
look now what we're going to do is show
you<00:00:36.489> some<00:00:36.789> things<00:00:37.059> where<00:00:37.359> people<00:00:37.929> run<00:00:38.079> into

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:38.260 
you some things where people run into

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.200 
you some things where people run into
some<00:00:38.469> problems<00:00:38.769> on<00:00:38.890> the<00:00:38.979> install<00:00:39.399> and<00:00:39.699> that

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:40.210 
some problems on the install and that

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:41.849 
some problems on the install and that
due<00:00:40.659> mainly<00:00:41.050> to<00:00:41.260> not<00:00:41.530> reading<00:00:41.800> the

00:00:41.849 --> 00:00:41.859 
due mainly to not reading the

00:00:41.859 --> 00:00:43.379 
due mainly to not reading the
instructions<00:00:42.429> but<00:00:42.940> we're<00:00:43.059> going<00:00:43.149> to<00:00:43.210> walk<00:00:43.359> you

00:00:48.299 --> 00:00:48.309 
install is the board will be pulled away

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:50.459 
install is the board will be pulled away
from<00:00:48.460> the<00:00:48.670> body<00:00:48.879> in<00:00:49.059> the<00:00:49.179> front<00:00:49.389> or<00:00:49.659> it<00:00:50.260> can<00:00:50.379> be

00:00:50.459 --> 00:00:50.469 
from the body in the front or it can be

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:51.779 
from the body in the front or it can be
tight<00:00:50.679> in<00:00:50.799> the<00:00:50.889> front<00:00:50.920> pulled<00:00:51.399> away<00:00:51.549> in<00:00:51.639> the
