would have been great one nice thing is

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:37.430 
would have been great one nice thing is
the<00:00:36.180> first<00:00:36.390> time<00:00:36.540> we<00:00:36.690> saw<00:00:36.809> this<00:00:36.989> figure<00:00:37.170> had<00:00:37.410> a

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
the first time we saw this figure had a

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.369 
the first time we saw this figure had a
big<00:00:37.680> chest<00:00:37.980> piece<00:00:38.250> and<00:00:38.719> they<00:00:39.719> took<00:00:39.960> that<00:00:39.989> off

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
big chest piece and they took that off

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.440 
big chest piece and they took that off
for<00:00:41.129> the<00:00:41.250> final<00:00:41.579> production<00:00:41.850> I<00:00:42.180> think<00:00:42.360> it

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
for the final production I think it

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.580 
for the final production I think it
looks<00:00:42.600> better<00:00:42.660> without<00:00:43.469> the<00:00:43.860> big<00:00:44.040> chest<00:00:44.309> piece

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:45.590 
looks better without the big chest piece

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:49.160 
looks better without the big chest piece
he's<00:00:46.590> got<00:00:46.890> this<00:00:47.850> is<00:00:48.030> a<00:00:48.059> new<00:00:48.270> waste<00:00:48.510> piece<00:00:48.840> and<00:00:49.110> a

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
he's got this is a new waste piece and a

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.889 
he's got this is a new waste piece and a
new<00:00:49.289> cape<00:00:49.559> I<00:00:50.180> really<00:00:51.180> like<00:00:51.270> the<00:00:51.420> way<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:51.690> Cape

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
new cape I really like the way the Cape

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.959 
new cape I really like the way the Cape
flows<00:00:52.289> in<00:00:52.500> the<00:00:52.590> back<00:00:52.800> I<00:00:53.190> think<00:00:53.760> it<00:00:53.820> looks

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
flows in the back I think it looks

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.290 
flows in the back I think it looks
awesome<00:00:54.860> these<00:00:55.860> gloves<00:00:56.190> are<00:00:56.370> new<00:00:56.550> as<00:00:56.670> well<00:00:56.699> but

of sense also I seem to have gotten yeah
I<00:01:13.950> did<00:01:14.220> huh<00:01:15.200> got<00:01:16.200> two<00:01:16.350> left<00:01:16.560> arms<00:01:16.860> in<00:01:16.979> mine

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.380 
I did huh got two left arms in mine
that's<00:01:17.850> nice

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:20.390 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:24.080 

the<00:01:21.390> tamp<00:01:21.960> was<00:01:22.200> on<00:01:22.289> the<00:01:22.380> arm<00:01:22.640> don't<00:01:23.640> go<00:01:23.789> all<00:01:24.060> the

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
the tamp was on the arm don't go all the

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.239 
the tamp was on the arm don't go all the
way<00:01:24.240> around<00:01:24.329> the<00:01:24.659> arm<00:01:24.840> but<00:01:25.229> I<00:01:25.469> think<00:01:26.159> we<00:01:26.219> should

00:01:26.239 --> 00:01:26.249 
way around the arm but I think we should

00:01:26.249 --> 00:01:29.179 
way around the arm but I think we should
be<00:01:26.490> used<00:01:26.670> to<00:01:26.789> that<00:01:26.819> by<00:01:26.969> now<00:01:27.950> alright<00:01:28.950> we<00:01:29.039> ran

be used to that by now alright we ran

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:30.980 
be used to that by now alright we ran

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
out of batteries there I was saying that

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.719 
out of batteries there I was saying that
Thor<00:01:31.229> comes<00:01:31.500> with<00:01:31.710> his<00:01:31.920> hammer<00:01:32.130> which<00:01:32.429> is<00:01:32.549> also

a new sculpt it's pretty detailed very
movie<00:01:36.390> accurate<00:01:37.100> it's<00:01:38.100> a<00:01:38.130> great<00:01:38.369> size<00:01:38.640> forum

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 
movie accurate it's a great size forum

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:44.660 
movie accurate it's a great size forum
if<00:01:41.130> you<00:01:41.219> take<00:01:41.369> off<00:01:41.520> his<00:01:41.670> hair<00:01:41.969> and<00:01:43.369> by<00:01:44.369> the<00:01:44.429> way

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
if you take off his hair and by the way

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:45.559 
if you take off his hair and by the way
this<00:01:44.909> would<00:01:45.090> have<00:01:45.179> been<00:01:45.209> a<00:01:45.329> great<00:01:45.450> opportunity

00:01:45.559 --> 00:01:45.569 
this would have been a great opportunity

00:01:45.569 --> 00:01:48.859 
this would have been a great opportunity
to<00:01:46.380> put<00:01:46.649> a<00:01:47.030> yelling<00:01:48.030> face<00:01:48.209> on<00:01:48.390> the<00:01:48.450> back<00:01:48.599> of<00:01:48.630> his

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
to put a yelling face on the back of his

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.599 
to put a yelling face on the back of his
head<00:01:49.020> I<00:01:49.259> wish<00:01:49.740> diamond<00:01:49.950> would<00:01:50.189> do<00:01:50.310> that<00:01:50.429> more

00:01:50.599 --> 00:01:50.609 
head I wish diamond would do that more

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:53.440 
head I wish diamond would do that more
often<00:01:50.789> I<00:01:51.149> think<00:01:51.509> they've<00:01:51.630> only<00:01:51.750> done<00:01:51.899> it<00:01:51.959> twice

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
often I think they've only done it twice

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:58.069 
often I think they've only done it twice
anyway<00:01:54.450> and<00:01:54.840> he<00:01:54.869> has<00:01:55.200> it<00:01:55.349> helmets<00:01:56.659> the<00:01:57.659> helmet

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
anyway and he has it helmets the helmet

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:02.809 
anyway and he has it helmets the helmet
I<00:02:00.500> suppose<00:02:01.500> it<00:02:01.619> looks<00:02:01.770> a<00:02:01.860> little<00:02:02.129> big<00:02:02.429> on<00:02:02.579> him

00:02:02.809 --> 00:02:02.819 
I suppose it looks a little big on him

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:06.020 
I suppose it looks a little big on him
but<00:02:03.530> as<00:02:04.530> far<00:02:04.739> as<00:02:04.799> minimates<00:02:05.340> go<00:02:05.549> I<00:02:05.579> think<00:02:05.789> it's

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
but as far as minimates go I think it's

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.389 
but as far as minimates go I think it's
a<00:02:06.090> pretty<00:02:06.239> good<00:02:06.360> fit<00:02:06.780> I<00:02:07.020> think<00:02:08.009> it<00:02:08.099> looks<00:02:08.250> cool

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
a pretty good fit I think it looks cool

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:13.460

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
looks like he walked right out of the

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.380 
looks like he walked right out of the
film<00:02:26.819> pretty<00:02:27.180> much<00:02:28.099> he<00:02:29.099> really<00:02:30.060> should<00:02:30.360> be

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
film pretty much he really should be

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.470 
film pretty much he really should be
taller<00:02:30.870> based<00:02:31.380> on<00:02:31.590> his<00:02:31.709> film<00:02:32.010> appearance<00:02:32.480> I'm

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
but sure to be nice if they could have

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:41.630
