00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
card and I put it in there nice and

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.030 
card and I put it in there nice and
gently<00:01:49.079> the<00:01:49.200> way<00:01:49.290> it<00:01:49.380> isn't<00:01:49.500> I<00:01:49.590> always<00:01:49.770> have<00:01:49.920> it

towards<00:01:52.890> the<00:01:52.979> top<00:01:53.329> what<00:01:54.329> I<00:01:54.360> do<00:01:54.450> nice<00:01:54.720> is<00:01:54.869> just

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
towards the top what I do nice is just

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:56.990 
towards the top what I do nice is just
like<00:01:55.229> you<00:01:55.350> guys<00:01:55.500> are<00:01:55.560> normally<00:01:56.009> do<00:01:56.189> go<00:01:56.850> ahead

like you guys are normally do go ahead

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.980 
like you guys are normally do go ahead
and<00:01:57.090> peel<00:01:57.240> it<00:01:57.390> off<00:01:58.310> and<00:01:59.310> fold<00:02:00.149> it<00:02:00.270> over<00:02:00.329> lay<00:02:00.869> it

this is where most people end up

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.249 
this is where most people end up
stopping<00:02:05.909> and<00:02:06.270> this<00:02:06.450> is<00:02:06.540> how<00:02:06.659> I<00:02:06.689> receive<00:02:07.049> a<00:02:07.079> lot

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
stopping and this is how I receive a lot

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:08.300 
stopping and this is how I receive a lot
of<00:02:07.409> cards<00:02:07.649> when<00:02:07.770> they<00:02:07.860> do<00:02:07.950> put<00:02:08.129> them<00:02:08.220> in

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
of cards when they do put them in

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:09.680 
of cards when they do put them in
packages<00:02:08.700> like<00:02:08.759> this<00:02:08.940> I<00:02:09.030> was<00:02:09.149> appreciate<00:02:09.539> when

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
packages like this I was appreciate when

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:10.660 
packages like this I was appreciate when
they<00:02:09.780> do

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
they do

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:13.030 
they do
to<00:02:10.819> me<00:02:11.360> problem<00:02:12.290> is<00:02:12.440> that<00:02:12.740> they<00:02:12.830> got<00:02:12.920> this

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
to me problem is that they got this

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.190 
to me problem is that they got this
little<00:02:13.340> wings<00:02:14.240> on<00:02:14.480> the<00:02:14.569> side<00:02:14.780> here<00:02:14.989> and<00:02:15.080> it

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
shove it all the way to one side of the

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.000 
shove it all the way to one side of the
package<00:02:26.480> see<00:02:26.750> oh<00:02:26.780> that's<00:02:26.900> real<00:02:27.590> close<00:02:27.739> to<00:02:27.890> one

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
package see oh that's real close to one

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:29.199 
package see oh that's real close to one
side<00:02:28.220> of<00:02:28.280> the<00:02:28.340> package<00:02:28.670> of<00:02:28.790> the<00:02:28.819> other<00:02:28.970> side

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:29.209 
side of the package of the other side

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:31.420 
side of the package of the other side
it's<00:02:29.330> got<00:02:29.450> that<00:02:29.600> little<00:02:29.870> lip<00:02:30.530> there<00:02:30.560> next

I actually pinch it down the cardigan

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:55.300 
I actually pinch it down the cardigan
lay<00:02:52.280> flat<00:02:52.640> down<00:02:52.940> and<00:02:53.840> where<00:02:54.319> that<00:02:54.590> lip<00:02:54.860> over

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
lay flat down and where that lip over

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:57.940 
lay flat down and where that lip over
and<00:02:55.880> pinch<00:02:56.600> it<00:02:56.690> down<00:02:56.900> and<00:02:57.110> actually<00:02:57.230> tape<00:02:57.650> that

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
and pinch it down and actually tape that

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:01.870 
and pinch it down and actually tape that
lip<00:02:58.250> down<00:02:59.000> to<00:02:59.420> the<00:02:59.950> actual<00:03:00.950> vein<00:03:01.190> to<00:03:01.819> the
