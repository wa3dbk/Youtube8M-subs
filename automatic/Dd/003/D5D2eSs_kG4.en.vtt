and<00:00:47.430> I<00:00:48.149> have<00:00:49.039> blow-dried<00:00:50.039> it's<00:00:50.309> just<00:00:51.059> that

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
and I have blow-dried it's just that

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.260 
and I have blow-dried it's just that
it's<00:00:51.360> all<00:00:51.629> really<00:00:52.050> really<00:00:52.170> dry<00:00:52.680> and<00:00:53.100> just<00:00:53.670> to

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
it's all really really dry and just to

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.439 
it's all really really dry and just to
sort<00:00:54.510> of<00:00:54.660> tame<00:00:55.170> it<00:00:55.410> a<00:00:55.620> little<00:00:55.949> bit<00:00:56.160> because<00:00:56.460> my

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
sort of tame it a little bit because my

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.450 
sort of tame it a little bit because my
hair<00:00:57.660> is<00:00:57.840> naturally<00:00:58.050> quite<00:00:58.530> big<00:00:58.800> and<00:00:59.100> frizzy

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
hair is naturally quite big and frizzy

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.689 
hair is naturally quite big and frizzy
so<00:01:00.239> it<00:01:00.870> just<00:01:01.140> makes<00:01:01.320> it<00:01:01.500> a<00:01:01.649> little<00:01:01.859> bit<00:01:02.129> easy<00:01:02.430> to

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
so it just makes it a little bit easy to

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.500 
so it just makes it a little bit easy to
work<00:01:02.879> with<00:01:02.940> if<00:01:03.390> I<00:01:03.510> do<00:01:03.570> that<00:01:03.870> first<00:01:04.220> so<00:01:05.510> we're

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
work with if I do that first so we're

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.760 
work with if I do that first so we're
going<00:01:06.659> to<00:01:06.780> begin<00:01:07.470> by<00:01:08.220> first<00:01:09.439> sectioning<00:01:10.439> the

sections

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.850 
sections
just<00:01:17.159> like<00:01:17.549> this<00:01:17.909> on<00:01:18.240> either<00:01:18.420> side<00:01:18.810> and<00:01:19.229> I

just like this on either side and I

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.620

defense spray anyway and the one that

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.380 
defense spray anyway and the one that
I've<00:01:24.180> used<00:01:24.420> is<00:01:24.689> this<00:01:24.869> resume<00:01:25.439> heat<00:01:26.390> styling

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390

wand<00:01:32.280> and<00:01:32.520> this<00:01:32.670> one<00:01:32.909> is<00:01:33.150> the<00:01:33.720> Remington<00:01:34.380> I

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
wand and this one is the Remington I

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.380 
wand and this one is the Remington I
can't<00:01:35.040> remember<00:01:35.280> the<00:01:35.520> name<00:01:35.700> I<00:01:36.000> think<00:01:36.240> it's

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
can't remember the name I think it's

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.749 
can't remember the name I think it's
something<00:01:36.630> to<00:01:36.869> do<00:01:36.990> with<00:01:37.079> pearls<00:01:37.439> and<00:01:38.130> I'll

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
something to do with pearls and I'll

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.300 
something to do with pearls and I'll
find<00:01:39.180> out<00:01:39.299> and<00:01:39.600> put<00:01:39.840> the<00:01:39.930> link<00:01:40.140> below<00:01:40.229> and<00:01:40.860> it

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
find out and put the link below and it

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.160 
find out and put the link below and it
just<00:01:41.520> looks<00:01:41.700> like<00:01:41.790> this<00:01:42.060> it's<00:01:42.420> got<00:01:42.659> a<00:01:42.840> really

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
just looks like this it's got a really

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.429 
just looks like this it's got a really
simple<00:01:43.530> em<00:01:44.240> setting<00:01:45.240> so<00:01:45.720> I've<00:01:45.840> got<00:01:46.020> this<00:01:46.140> step

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
simple em setting so I've got this step

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:51.200 
simple em setting so I've got this step
that's<00:01:46.740> 808<00:01:47.700> C<00:01:48.500> so<00:01:49.500> we're<00:01:49.710> just<00:01:49.740> going<00:01:50.189> to<00:01:50.610> to

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
that's 808 C so we're just going to to

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.280 
that's 808 C so we're just going to to
get<00:01:51.360> the<00:01:51.479> type<00:01:51.689> of<00:01:51.720> curls

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
get the type of curls

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.100 
get the type of curls
that<00:01:52.500> you<00:01:52.649> saw<00:01:52.860> before<00:01:53.009> and<00:01:53.810> you're<00:01:54.810> going<00:01:55.079> to

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
that you saw before and you're going to

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.999 
that you saw before and you're going to
wait<00:01:55.409> to<00:01:55.680> hold<00:01:56.549> the<00:01:57.270> one<00:01:57.479> up<00:01:57.810> and<00:01:58.110> then<00:01:58.560> down

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
wait to hold the one up and then down

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:03.260 
wait to hold the one up and then down
like<00:01:59.520> this<00:02:00.860> because<00:02:01.860> you<00:02:02.040> can<00:02:02.280> do<00:02:02.430> it<00:02:02.610> just

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
like this because you can do it just

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.600 
like this because you can do it just
wrapping<00:02:03.540> around<00:02:03.659> that<00:02:04.110> way<00:02:04.320> which<00:02:05.219> also

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
wrapping around that way which also

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.330 
wrapping around that way which also
works<00:02:06.119> fine<00:02:06.750> but<00:02:07.200> it<00:02:07.380> just<00:02:07.649> means<00:02:07.860> that<00:02:08.039> the

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
works fine but it just means that the

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.669 
works fine but it just means that the
curl<00:02:08.640> will<00:02:08.849> look<00:02:09.000> a<00:02:09.119> little<00:02:09.209> bit<00:02:09.390> different<00:02:09.899> so

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
curl will look a little bit different so

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.210 
curl will look a little bit different so
this<00:02:11.099> look<00:02:11.370> that<00:02:11.610> I'm<00:02:11.819> sure

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
this look that I'm sure

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.460 
this look that I'm sure

you guys you're gonna want to lift this

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:19.170 
you guys you're gonna want to lift this

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
just gonna want to take this piece of

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:27.120

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.130 
hair and wrap this around the wand like

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.450 
hair and wrap this around the wand like
so<00:02:27.700> and<00:02:28.630> you're<00:02:29.530> not<00:02:29.650> gonna<00:02:29.740> want<00:02:29.830> to<00:02:30.010> hold<00:02:30.280> it

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:30.460 
so and you're not gonna want to hold it

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:32.790 
so and you're not gonna want to hold it
for<00:02:30.670> very<00:02:30.940> long<00:02:31.270> that's<00:02:31.570> all<00:02:31.780> maybe<00:02:32.080> like<00:02:32.350> five

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:32.800 
for very long that's all maybe like five

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:38.190 
for very long that's all maybe like five
seconds<00:02:33.580> and<00:02:33.970> that<00:02:34.390> will<00:02:34.420> do<00:02:34.780> the<00:02:34.930> trick<00:02:34.960> so<00:02:37.200> if

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
seconds and that will do the trick so if

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.880 
seconds and that will do the trick so if
I<00:02:38.350> just<00:02:38.560> pull<00:02:38.800> this<00:02:38.920> up<00:02:39.160> now<00:02:39.990> and<00:02:40.990> you<00:02:41.410> can<00:02:41.620> see

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
I just pull this up now and you can see

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:44.970 
I just pull this up now and you can see
it<00:02:42.010> there's<00:02:42.400> definitely<00:02:43.150> a<00:02:43.450> nice<00:02:44.170> curl<00:02:44.680> them

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
it there's definitely a nice curl them

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:46.740 
it there's definitely a nice curl them
and<00:02:45.190> I<00:02:45.220> don't<00:02:45.280> want<00:02:45.459> to<00:02:45.550> hold<00:02:45.700> it<00:02:45.850> too<00:02:46.060> long<00:02:46.240> one

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
and I don't want to hold it too long one

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.750 
and I don't want to hold it too long one
because<00:02:47.290> I<00:02:47.560> find<00:02:47.800> it<00:02:47.920> really<00:02:47.950> damaging<00:02:48.520> for

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
because I find it really damaging for

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.170 
because I find it really damaging for
the<00:02:48.820> hair<00:02:49.120> and<00:02:49.530> two<00:02:50.640> it's<00:02:51.640> just<00:02:51.880> unnecessary

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
the hair and two it's just unnecessary

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:56.300 
the hair and two it's just unnecessary
to<00:02:52.690> do<00:02:52.900> so<00:02:53.170> to<00:02:53.980> get<00:02:54.160> this<00:02:54.310> type<00:02:54.640> of<00:02:54.670> curl<00:02:55.600> so

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
to do so to get this type of curl so

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.250 
to do so to get this type of curl so
that's<00:02:57.310> one<00:02:58.090> for<00:02:58.450> you<00:02:58.630> and<00:02:58.870> for<00:02:59.050> the<00:02:59.140> other

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
that's one for you and for the other

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:00.570 
that's one for you and for the other
side<00:02:59.530> we're<00:02:59.740> gonna<00:02:59.800> repeat<00:03:00.160> the<00:03:00.310> exact<00:03:00.550> same

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:00.580 
side we're gonna repeat the exact same

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:03.870 
side we're gonna repeat the exact same
steps<00:03:02.010> I'll<00:03:03.010> just<00:03:03.130> turn<00:03:03.310> this<00:03:03.490> way<00:03:03.670> you<00:03:03.730> will

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:03.880 
steps I'll just turn this way you will

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:07.470 
steps I'll just turn this way you will
lift<00:03:04.060> the<00:03:04.360> one<00:03:04.540> up<00:03:04.810> and<00:03:05.350> back<00:03:05.800> down<00:03:06.330> take<00:03:07.330> the

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
lift the one up and back down take the

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.060 
lift the one up and back down take the
piece<00:03:07.660> of<00:03:07.690> hair<00:03:07.870> and<00:03:08.380> you're<00:03:08.500> just<00:03:08.620> gonna<00:03:08.800> want

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:13.870 
to wrap this around the one and then

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:17.280 
to wrap this around the one and then
just<00:03:14.140> hold<00:03:14.500> this<00:03:14.920> for<00:03:15.250> about<00:03:16.180> five<00:03:16.600> seconds

and then hold for like I say about five
seconds<00:04:05.140> you<00:04:05.830> will<00:04:05.950> not<00:04:06.040> need<00:04:06.190> this<00:04:06.370> any

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:06.580 
seconds you will not need this any

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:10.560 
seconds you will not need this any
longer<00:04:07.060> than<00:04:07.209> that<00:04:07.450> and<00:04:08.700> then<00:04:09.700> just<00:04:09.970> pull<00:04:10.540> the

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:10.570 
longer than that and then just pull the

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:15.060 
longer than that and then just pull the
hair<00:04:10.810> up<00:04:11.019> and<00:04:12.269> you'll<00:04:13.269> have<00:04:13.330> a<00:04:13.540> nice<00:04:13.750> curl<00:04:14.140> so

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:15.070 
hair up and you'll have a nice curl so

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:16.830 
hair up and you'll have a nice curl so
I'm<00:04:15.220> just<00:04:15.430> gonna<00:04:15.580> carry<00:04:15.850> on<00:04:16.150> repeating<00:04:16.720> at

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:16.840 
I'm just gonna carry on repeating at

00:04:16.840 --> 00:06:10.660 
I'm just gonna carry on repeating at
these<00:04:16.959> steps<00:04:17.290> on<00:04:17.470> both<00:04:17.769> sides<00:04:18.070> of<00:04:18.130> my<00:04:18.250> hair

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:10.670 

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:14.360 

so<00:06:11.670> once<00:06:12.240> you<00:06:12.570> are<00:06:12.600> completely<00:06:13.560> done<00:06:13.889> you<00:06:14.250> will

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:14.370 
so once you are completely done you will

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:16.490 
so once you are completely done you will
have<00:06:14.610> something<00:06:14.910> that<00:06:15.120> looks<00:06:15.540> a<00:06:15.870> little<00:06:16.139> bit

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:16.500 
have something that looks a little bit

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:17.840 
have something that looks a little bit
like<00:06:16.980> this

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:17.850 
like this

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:22.640 
like this
and<00:06:18.260> I<00:06:19.310> think<00:06:20.310> this<00:06:20.730> looks<00:06:21.090> quite<00:06:21.389> nice<00:06:21.810> but<00:06:22.380> I

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:22.650 
and I think this looks quite nice but I

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:25.190 
and I think this looks quite nice but I
definitely<00:06:23.130> like<00:06:23.700> it<00:06:23.730> a<00:06:24.090> little<00:06:24.330> bit<00:06:24.630> looser

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:25.200 
definitely like it a little bit looser

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:27.890 
definitely like it a little bit looser
so<00:06:25.440> what<00:06:26.100> I<00:06:26.340> like<00:06:26.520> to<00:06:26.730> do<00:06:26.850> is<00:06:27.060> just<00:06:27.330> take<00:06:27.570> any

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:27.900

so what I like to do is just take any
brush<00:06:28.320> and<00:06:28.740> just<00:06:29.580> start<00:06:30.030> to<00:06:30.180> brush<00:06:30.389> through

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:30.630 
brush and just start to brush through

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:33.909 
brush and just start to brush through
the<00:06:30.750> ends<00:06:31.410> of<00:06:31.590> the<00:06:31.710> hair<00:06:31.919> not<00:06:32.910> from<00:06:33.540> the<00:06:33.720> roots
