I<00:04:14.010> think<00:04:14.580> was<00:04:14.760> public<00:04:15.180> pressure<00:04:15.450> it's<00:04:15.780> very

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
I think was public pressure it's very

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:18.229 
I think was public pressure it's very
likely<00:04:16.350> that<00:04:16.560> Mike<00:04:16.919> Rice<00:04:17.220> does<00:04:17.850> end<00:04:18.120> up

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:18.239 
likely that Mike Rice does end up

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:19.640 
likely that Mike Rice does end up
getting<00:04:18.570> fired<00:04:18.840> I<00:04:19.079> think<00:04:19.320> the<00:04:19.410> thing<00:04:19.440> that

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:19.650 
getting fired I think the thing that

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:21.949 
getting fired I think the thing that
I've<00:04:19.859> come<00:04:20.160> to<00:04:20.370> is<00:04:20.459> I<00:04:20.609> should<00:04:21.480> he<00:04:21.540> be<00:04:21.690> fine<00:04:21.930> i

the gym and walk away from the game and
that's<00:05:15.570> not<00:05:15.900> what<00:05:16.169> a<00:05:16.200> coach<00:05:16.500> should<00:05:16.740> be<00:05:16.889> about

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:18.110 
that's not what a coach should be about

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:20.750 
that's not what a coach should be about
we'll<00:05:19.110> see<00:05:19.350> ultimately<00:05:19.650> what<00:05:20.130> does<00:05:20.340> transpire

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:20.760 
we'll see ultimately what does transpire

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:24.050 
we'll see ultimately what does transpire
with<00:05:21.240> mike<00:05:21.810> rice<00:05:22.140> in<00:05:22.470> the<00:05:22.979> Rutgers<00:05:23.370> situation

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:24.060 
with mike rice in the Rutgers situation

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:27.170 
with mike rice in the Rutgers situation
but<00:05:24.240> I<00:05:24.270> think<00:05:24.870> having<00:05:25.410> seen<00:05:25.830> this<00:05:25.979> video<00:05:26.370> it's

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:27.180 
but I think having seen this video it's

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:28.820 
but I think having seen this video it's
pretty<00:05:27.539> clear<00:05:27.870> that<00:05:27.900> he<00:05:28.229> is<00:05:28.350> going<00:05:28.590> to<00:05:28.770> be

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:28.830 
pretty clear that he is going to be

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:31.460 
pretty clear that he is going to be
fired<00:05:29.130> and<00:05:29.490> it's<00:05:29.669> a<00:05:29.789> matter<00:05:30.000> of<00:05:30.150> when<00:05:30.870> not<00:05:31.200> if

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:31.470 
fired and it's a matter of when not if

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:34.850 
fired and it's a matter of when not if
I'll<00:05:31.890> catch<00:05:32.130> you<00:05:32.280> guys<00:05:32.310> next<00:05:32.430> time
