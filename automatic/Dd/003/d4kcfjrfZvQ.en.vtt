stay on the table no matter what and

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:04.299 
stay on the table no matter what and
this<00:01:02.269> we<00:01:02.930> put<00:01:03.140> in<00:01:03.230> a<00:01:03.320> rule<00:01:03.530> that<00:01:03.559> it<00:01:03.980> could<00:01:04.129> hit

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:04.309 
this we put in a rule that it could hit

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:06.250 
this we put in a rule that it could hit
off<00:01:04.430> anything<00:01:04.850> like<00:01:05.269> the<00:01:05.449> walls<00:01:05.720> the<00:01:06.020> poles

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:06.260 
off anything like the walls the poles

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:07.899 
off anything like the walls the poles
the<00:01:06.440> ceiling<00:01:06.800> as<00:01:06.950> long<00:01:07.430> as<00:01:07.520> the<00:01:07.580> hit<00:01:07.700> on<00:01:07.730> the

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:07.909 
the ceiling as long as the hit on the

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:09.940 
the ceiling as long as the hit on the
table<00:01:08.270> before<00:01:08.420> it<00:01:08.630> hit<00:01:08.810> the<00:01:08.840> ground<00:01:08.930> again<00:01:09.290> so

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:09.950 
table before it hit the ground again so

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:11.680 
table before it hit the ground again so
you<00:01:10.010> would<00:01:10.190> have<00:01:10.220> we<00:01:10.730> actually<00:01:10.880> video<00:01:11.120> tape<00:01:11.450> 21

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:11.690
