 families with children and some smaller ones 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:45.110
 children is all that suits something 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:47.000

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.780
 13 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:31.220
 accident number but in this case 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.599
 this certainly not an accident because you will find here 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:34.970
 the best snow 

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:36.769
 red or black variant remains the 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:39.700

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:39.700
 crack in the snow

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:05.110
 people come and that is actually crazy 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:06.220
 stand under a your route moon on the 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:07.750
 piste map that the whole of the 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.640

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:11.290
 not that spectacular but in it 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.909
 it really is really nice to stand 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:13.750
 trees next to the slopes a lot of wooden 

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:15.459
 huts 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:16.900
 it really characterizes the piste 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:19.510
 execution is number 3 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:21.400
 and that is in black, blue and red 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:21.910

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.280
 speed

 also great to start than descent 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.909
