00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:06.020 
on the old days when we didn't have

on the old days when we didn't have
tracked<00:00:06.319> men<00:00:06.559> or<00:00:06.710> any<00:00:06.859> of<00:00:07.010> those<00:00:07.099> devices<00:00:07.460> if<00:00:08.300> I

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:08.450 
tracked men or any of those devices if I

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:10.390 
tracked men or any of those devices if I
got<00:00:08.660> a<00:00:08.690> new<00:00:08.870> driver<00:00:09.170> I<00:00:09.349> had<00:00:09.620> to<00:00:09.740> go<00:00:09.860> out<00:00:10.070> on<00:00:10.099> the

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:10.400 
got a new driver I had to go out on the

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.790 
got a new driver I had to go out on the
golf<00:00:10.610> course<00:00:10.880> and<00:00:11.150> hit<00:00:11.810> it<00:00:11.930> on<00:00:12.140> my<00:00:12.290> old<00:00:12.500> driver

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:12.800 
golf course and hit it on my old driver

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.620 
golf course and hit it on my old driver
against<00:00:13.100> my<00:00:13.310> new<00:00:13.460> driver<00:00:13.760> to<00:00:14.030> see<00:00:14.210> which<00:00:14.420> one

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:14.630 
against my new driver to see which one

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:18.009 
against my new driver to see which one
goes<00:00:14.810> further<00:00:15.140> nowadays<00:00:16.039> if<00:00:17.029> I<00:00:17.269> I<00:00:17.300> can<00:00:17.779> test

00:00:18.009 --> 00:00:18.019 
goes further nowadays if I I can test

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:20.380 
goes further nowadays if I I can test
ten<00:00:18.470> drivers<00:00:18.950> in<00:00:19.190> a<00:00:19.280> matter<00:00:19.520> of<00:00:19.610> 10<00:00:20.000> minutes

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:20.390 
ten drivers in a matter of 10 minutes

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:22.390 
ten drivers in a matter of 10 minutes
with<00:00:20.780> the<00:00:20.810> track<00:00:21.140> man<00:00:21.410> just<00:00:21.740> hit<00:00:21.890> two<00:00:22.100> or<00:00:22.220> three

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:22.400 
with the track man just hit two or three

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.910 
with the track man just hit two or three
balls<00:00:22.670> and<00:00:23.000> it<00:00:23.119> tells<00:00:23.390> me<00:00:23.539> right<00:00:23.840> away<00:00:23.990> whether

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:24.920 
balls and it tells me right away whether

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:28.390 
balls and it tells me right away whether
this<00:00:25.220> driver<00:00:25.550> has<00:00:25.880> you<00:00:26.390> know<00:00:26.980> potential<00:00:27.980> but

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:28.400 
this driver has you know potential but

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:29.800 
this driver has you know potential but
it<00:00:28.550> might<00:00:28.789> be<00:00:28.940> better<00:00:29.150> than<00:00:29.390> the<00:00:29.510> one<00:00:29.660> I'm

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:29.810 
it might be better than the one I'm

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:32.200 
it might be better than the one I'm
using<00:00:30.020> or<00:00:30.380> if<00:00:30.529> it's<00:00:30.680> no<00:00:30.980> good<00:00:31.010> just<00:00:31.400> by<00:00:31.789> looking

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:32.210 
using or if it's no good just by looking

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:34.060 
using or if it's no good just by looking
at<00:00:32.300> the<00:00:32.449> numbers<00:00:32.780> I<00:00:33.020> think<00:00:33.350> everyone<00:00:33.710> uses<00:00:34.039> it

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:34.070 
at the numbers I think everyone uses it

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:36.219 
at the numbers I think everyone uses it
when<00:00:34.340> they<00:00:34.579> when<00:00:35.210> they<00:00:35.329> especially<00:00:35.600> taste<00:00:36.050> the

00:00:36.219 --> 00:00:36.229 
when they when they especially taste the

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:38.619 
when they when they especially taste the
woods<00:00:36.519> there's<00:00:37.519> a<00:00:37.579> lot<00:00:37.760> of<00:00:37.819> guys<00:00:38.030> that<00:00:38.239> travel

00:00:38.619 --> 00:00:38.629 
woods there's a lot of guys that travel

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:40.629 
woods there's a lot of guys that travel
with<00:00:38.780> it<00:00:38.929> they've<00:00:39.440> got<00:00:39.620> it<00:00:39.739> at<00:00:39.859> home<00:00:39.890> practice

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:40.639 
with it they've got it at home practice

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:41.139 
with it they've got it at home practice
with<00:00:40.819> it

00:00:41.139 --> 00:00:41.149 
with it

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:45.639

00:00:56.229 --> 00:00:56.239 
actually around the Greens because the

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:58.090 
actually around the Greens because the
spin<00:00:56.569> rate<00:00:56.749> so<00:00:57.079> there's<00:00:57.199> a<00:00:57.260> quite<00:00:57.469> nice<00:00:57.649> tool

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:58.100 
spin rate so there's a quite nice tool

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.840 
spin rate so there's a quite nice tool
to<00:00:58.129> to<00:00:58.940> practice<00:00:59.269> with<00:01:00.249> I'm<00:01:01.249> more<00:01:01.519> interested

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:05.659 
in the spin rate to carry the run out

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:07.840 
in the spin rate to carry the run out
and<00:01:05.900> the<00:01:06.080> you<00:01:06.440> know<00:01:06.560> overall<00:01:06.860> clubheads<00:01:07.670> be

I'm whenever I'm working on different

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:29.710 
I'm whenever I'm working on different
shops<00:01:26.930> I<00:01:27.110> do<00:01:27.380> do<00:01:27.950> go<00:01:28.130> and<00:01:28.250> track<00:01:28.430> well<00:01:29.180> you<00:01:29.600> know

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:29.720 
shops I do do go and track well you know

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.240 
shops I do do go and track well you know
usually<00:01:30.260> when<00:01:30.350> you're<00:01:30.500> standing<00:01:30.710> on<00:01:31.100> the

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:31.250 
usually when you're standing on the

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:33.760 
usually when you're standing on the
range<00:01:31.460> and<00:01:31.700> you<00:01:31.880> you<00:01:32.660> just<00:01:32.870> hit<00:01:33.020> balls<00:01:33.320> in<00:01:33.650> a

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:33.770 
range and you you just hit balls in a

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:35.440 
range and you you just hit balls in a
sunless<00:01:34.130> sea<00:01:34.220> you<00:01:34.340> get<00:01:34.460> into<00:01:34.730> a<00:01:34.760> routine<00:01:35.150> that

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:35.450 
sunless sea you get into a routine that

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:36.910 
sunless sea you get into a routine that
you<00:01:35.510> don't<00:01:35.690> focus<00:01:36.080> that<00:01:36.200> much<00:01:36.260> anymore

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:36.920 
you don't focus that much anymore

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.350 
you don't focus that much anymore
and<00:01:37.280> with<00:01:37.400> a<00:01:37.430> track<00:01:37.670> man<00:01:37.850> you<00:01:37.940> know<00:01:38.060> it's<00:01:38.210> quite

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:38.360 
and with a track man you know it's quite

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.360 
and with a track man you know it's quite
nice<00:01:38.540> to<00:01:38.600> get<00:01:39.080> a<00:01:39.140> distance<00:01:39.530> control<00:01:39.890> over<00:01:40.220> the

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:40.370 
nice to get a distance control over the

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:43.930 
nice to get a distance control over the
especially<00:01:40.850> with<00:01:40.940> the<00:01:41.000> short<00:01:41.240> irons<00:01:42.790> if<00:01:43.790> you

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:43.940 
especially with the short irons if you

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:47.890 
especially with the short irons if you
know<00:01:44.150> exactly<00:01:44.770> how<00:01:45.770> how<00:01:46.220> long<00:01:46.250> you<00:01:46.700> hit<00:01:46.900> a

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:47.900 
know exactly how how long you hit a

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:50.500 
know exactly how how long you hit a
regular<00:01:48.710> wedge<00:01:48.920> a<00:01:49.159> regular<00:01:49.490> 8-iron<00:01:49.909> so<00:01:50.210> it's

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:50.510 
regular wedge a regular 8-iron so it's
