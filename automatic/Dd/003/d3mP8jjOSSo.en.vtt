to show you and I lost it but a
vertebrae<00:01:54.979> in<00:01:55.979> a<00:01:56.100> puppy<00:01:56.430> is<00:01:56.579> about<00:01:56.909> the<00:01:57.119> size

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
vertebrae in a puppy is about the size

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.100 
vertebrae in a puppy is about the size
of<00:01:57.600> that<00:01:57.659> circle<00:01:58.350> on<00:01:58.500> the<00:01:59.189> 8th<00:01:59.750> you<00:02:00.750> can<00:02:00.899> see

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
of that circle on the 8th you can see

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.550 
of that circle on the 8th you can see
that<00:02:01.340> and<00:02:02.340> look<00:02:03.210> at<00:02:03.360> it<00:02:03.479> in<00:02:03.600> comparison<00:02:04.229> to<00:02:04.259> the

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
that and look at it in comparison to the

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:05.420 
that and look at it in comparison to the
size<00:02:04.740> of<00:02:04.890> the<00:02:05.009> band

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
size of the band

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.540

yesterday<00:02:05.939> they<00:02:06.149> only<00:02:06.299> desire<00:02:06.659> twice<00:02:07.550> the

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
yesterday they only desire twice the

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.999 
yesterday they only desire twice the
diameter<00:02:08.819> of<00:02:09.179> that<00:02:09.539> band<00:02:09.869> so<00:02:10.770> you're<00:02:10.890> talking

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
diameter of that band so you're talking

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.559 
diameter of that band so you're talking
about<00:02:11.160> a<00:02:11.250> vertebrae<00:02:11.700> that<00:02:11.910> is

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
about a vertebrae that is

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:14.539 
about a vertebrae that is
candy<00:02:13.230> candy<00:02:13.439> teeny<00:02:13.709> ends<00:02:13.950> and<00:02:14.250> it's

00:02:14.539 --> 00:02:14.549 
candy candy teeny ends and it's

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:16.970 
candy candy teeny ends and it's
surrounded<00:02:15.030> by<00:02:15.090> muscle<00:02:15.719> so<00:02:16.530> getting<00:02:16.769> it

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
surrounded by muscle so getting it

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.800 
surrounded by muscle so getting it
between<00:02:17.219> vertebra<00:02:17.790> if<00:02:18.269> you<00:02:18.480> guys<00:02:18.599> think

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
between vertebra if you guys think

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.589 
between vertebra if you guys think
that's<00:02:19.019> possible<00:02:19.530> you're<00:02:20.040> wrong<00:02:20.250> it<00:02:21.239> can't<00:02:21.510> be

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:21.599 
that's possible you're wrong it can't be

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:23.649
