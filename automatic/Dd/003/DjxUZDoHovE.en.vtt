00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.329
 I think a damn good chance that's why I store now 

00:00:11.329 --> 00:00:14.789
 although the opponent is not dead yet 

00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:15.799
 and I will 

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:17.050
 wines 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:20.050
 in serious injury 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.699
 it starts 

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:27.869
 where is he 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.609
 which AndrÃ© Moore had to record nationwide 

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:31.630
 these are 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:33.840
 not all weak opponents 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.380
 especially if you do not know them 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:39.380
 and I'm a bit driven collar 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.390
 and I think I'm stuck 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:46.390
 no, I do not think so 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.260
 was that you were told 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.860
 I saw him 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:59.040
 catch a breath 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:00.560
 and 

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.560
 Violin and 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:05.930
 do that 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:07.610
 War threatened 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:10.510
 I warred you today 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:13.510
 with delay 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:17.690
 which is not so good 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:20.690
 so first a great 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.300
 Morning air rank for the oyster and directly time unit rank and to the air 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.450
 Pauli up 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:31.450
 just to i throws 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.040
 France has also fallen behind 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.640
 and I think that's great 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:43.360
 I have realistic chances 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:53.920
 so now at least in 1 Menderes 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.920
 I do not know why I never say otherwise but always is 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:00.730
 the last punch places are 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:04.450
 Euro I have a normal way by my own 

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:13.339
 that is there that is typical 

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:16.339
 this is not the one on 

00:02:16.999 --> 00:02:19.999
 does not save anything safe 

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:25.309
 I'm already stronger than before, you have to see that we are now 

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:27.719
 really by far stronger opponent 

00:02:27.719 --> 00:02:30.689
 as the ones we are dealing with last time 

00:02:30.689 --> 00:02:34.179
 the last time were normal style to protect 

00:02:34.179 --> 00:02:37.469
 here are a lot 

00:02:37.469 --> 00:02:40.869
 and that she really only barbered good Barber so we should still here 

00:02:40.869 --> 00:02:42.889
 not be 

00:02:42.889 --> 00:02:45.969
 that is not intended that we are provided 

00:02:47.729 --> 00:02:50.729
 we are a damn good 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:55.009
 there hid 

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:58.009
 small 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:03.269
 and now coin dated 

00:03:04.139 --> 00:03:07.139
 not returned to the recipient 

00:03:11.149 --> 00:03:14.149
 from Dirk Godder view totally the habit from no matter 

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:17.000
 Bernd attachment find 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
 Healing and healing cure very well 

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:25.109
 Sina Resch 

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:30.419
 yes i know that you hate me yes i know that the world montage Eter me 

00:03:30.419 --> 00:03:33.419
 know that 

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:39.019
 I stated "The u 

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:42.019
 May grow steadily again 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:47.219
 under Voeckler 

00:03:47.219 --> 00:03:50.219
 I'm coming "I do not come here way people 

00:03:52.439 --> 00:03:54.529
 I just do not get away 

00:03:54.529 --> 00:03:57.739
 who could protect again Wengen BAG from the IMF 

00:03:59.429 --> 00:04:01.619
 Breker 

00:04:01.619 --> 00:04:04.619
 after highest 

00:04:06.009 --> 00:04:10.019
 deadly met now I'm redeeming you but something from member notes 

00:04:13.149 --> 00:04:16.549
 because they are totally professional and so on 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:19.549
 No until now 

00:04:25.029 --> 00:04:26.999
 that was too much 

00:04:26.999 --> 00:04:28.650
 and you have your heart 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:31.439
 I did not expect that anymore 

00:04:31.439 --> 00:04:34.459
 after what I have gone through with you now I would not have 

00:04:34.459 --> 00:04:37.710
 expects you to have a heart 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:38.979
 I can go out 

00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:41.599
 they said that there are enemies 

00:04:41.599 --> 00:04:43.889
 we have to do that 

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:45.889
 what's going on here 

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:48.889
 God does not tell me the destination 

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:51.889
 after seven times a boot are broken 

00:04:53.219 --> 00:04:56.150
 not so bad 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:58.639
 as I said that now opponents 

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:00.919
 vocally not intended for me 

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:03.919
 which ever meet from therefore 

00:05:06.629 --> 00:05:09.659
 what is actually quite okay what we have done there 

00:05:14.219 --> 00:05:16.189
 the opponent in the next room 

00:05:16.189 --> 00:05:19.189
 is the adversary of whom I want the soul 

00:05:20.289 --> 00:05:23.059
 real 

00:05:23.059 --> 00:05:25.289
 Tauber's deepest need 

00:05:25.289 --> 00:05:28.289
 At the same time he is a very strong opponent 

00:05:28.849 --> 00:05:31.849
 however, a single person is alone 

00:05:35.009 --> 00:05:38.199
 which is already an advantage 

00:05:38.199 --> 00:05:41.199
 I do not think that good to save while you stop 

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:47.180
 that's right 

00:05:47.789 --> 00:05:50.139
 a door but nothing that we could not fulfill
