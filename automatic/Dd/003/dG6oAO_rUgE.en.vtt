be one and a half ounces why do we need

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.720 
be one and a half ounces why do we need
dairy<00:00:27.590> well<00:00:28.590> aside<00:00:28.890> from<00:00:28.949> being<00:00:29.310> a<00:00:29.550> good

source<00:00:29.939> of<00:00:30.060> protein<00:00:31.130> we<00:00:32.130> get<00:00:32.759> calcium<00:00:33.120> from

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
source of protein we get calcium from

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.930 
source of protein we get calcium from
dairy<00:00:33.840> products<00:00:34.500> calcium<00:00:35.340> is<00:00:35.489> a<00:00:35.520> mineral<00:00:35.579> that

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
dairy products calcium is a mineral that

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.119 
dairy products calcium is a mineral that
we<00:00:36.149> need<00:00:36.329> in<00:00:36.360> relatively<00:00:36.930> large<00:00:37.440> amounts

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
we need in relatively large amounts

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.180 
we need in relatively large amounts
that's<00:00:38.730> why<00:00:38.910> we<00:00:39.059> need<00:00:39.210> the<00:00:39.360> dairy<00:00:39.600> products

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:40.190 
that's why we need the dairy products

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:43.729 
that's why we need the dairy products
calcium<00:00:41.190> of<00:00:41.340> course<00:00:41.579> is<00:00:42.540> needed<00:00:43.020> for<00:00:43.230> muscle

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
calcium of course is needed for muscle

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.220 
calcium of course is needed for muscle
contraction<00:00:44.390> it's<00:00:45.390> very<00:00:45.660> soothing<00:00:45.930> and

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
contraction it's very soothing and

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.889 
contraction it's very soothing and
relaxing<00:00:46.260> to<00:00:46.800> the<00:00:46.890> nervous<00:00:47.219> system<00:00:47.899> studies

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
relaxing to the nervous system studies

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.360 
relaxing to the nervous system studies
even<00:00:49.140> suggest<00:00:49.289> that<00:00:49.770> it<00:00:49.890> helps<00:00:50.100> to<00:00:50.219> lower

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
even suggest that it helps to lower

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.540 
even suggest that it helps to lower

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.650 
blood pressure has an alkalizing effect
on<00:00:53.879> the<00:00:54.000> body<00:00:54.410> so<00:00:55.670> dairy<00:00:56.670> products<00:00:57.090> are<00:00:57.270> very

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
on the body so dairy products are very

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.520 
on the body so dairy products are very
dependable<00:00:58.590> source<00:00:59.309> of<00:00:59.670> calcium<00:00:59.940> and<00:01:00.570> I<00:01:01.469> know

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
dependable source of calcium and I know

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.170 
dependable source of calcium and I know
that<00:01:01.739> some<00:01:01.920> people<00:01:02.190> don't<00:01:02.430> do<00:01:02.670> well<00:01:02.879> with

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
that some people don't do well with

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.729 
that some people don't do well with
