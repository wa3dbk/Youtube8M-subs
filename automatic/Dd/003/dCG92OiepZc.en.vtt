00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:02.730 
this is Michael from Ebola Middletown

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.340 
this is Michael from Ebola Middletown
and<00:00:03.440> then<00:00:04.440> to<00:00:04.560> top<00:00:04.770> sweep<00:00:05.870> distance<00:00:06.870> and<00:00:07.080> a<00:00:07.170> lot

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350 
and then to top sweep distance and a lot

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:08.900 
and then to top sweep distance and a lot
of<00:00:07.589> people<00:00:08.460> we<00:00:08.760> are

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
of people we are

of people we are
trouble<00:00:09.420> with<00:00:09.570> so<00:00:10.559> let<00:00:10.980> us<00:00:11.010> start<00:00:11.580> we<00:00:12.480> go<00:00:12.660> to

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
trouble with so let us start we go to

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.670 
trouble with so let us start we go to
insert<00:00:13.380> with<00:00:14.160> and<00:00:14.660> then<00:00:15.660> you<00:00:15.780> see<00:00:16.049> sketchy

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
insert with and then you see sketchy

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.300 
insert with and then you see sketchy
treachery<00:00:17.190> on<00:00:17.880> that<00:00:18.560> click<00:00:19.560> on<00:00:19.800> the<00:00:20.039> stress

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
treachery on that click on the stress

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.640 
treachery on that click on the stress
pain<00:00:21.590> slap<00:00:22.590> miss<00:00:22.920> stepping<00:00:23.490> water<00:00:23.910> scares<00:00:24.359> on

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:24.650 
pain slap miss stepping water scares on

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:31.269 
pain slap miss stepping water scares on
and<00:00:26.119> then<00:00:27.119> click<00:00:27.359> on<00:00:27.660> the<00:00:27.869> sketch<00:00:28.170> wheel

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:31.279 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:34.670 

now<00:00:32.279> you<00:00:32.340> can<00:00:32.640> subtle<00:00:33.120> sketch<00:00:33.530> first<00:00:34.530> thing

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
now you can subtle sketch first thing

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.100 
now you can subtle sketch first thing
you'll<00:00:34.860> enjoy<00:00:35.190> is<00:00:35.460> the<00:00:35.640> trajectory<00:00:35.899> this<00:00:36.899> is

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
you'll enjoy is the trajectory this is

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:54.960 
you'll enjoy is the trajectory this is
how<00:00:37.710> you<00:00:37.770> want<00:00:38.219> your<00:00:38.430> path<00:00:39.440> to<00:00:40.440> move

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:54.970 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:58.200 

now<00:00:55.540> we<00:00:55.600> are<00:00:55.960> going<00:00:56.170> a<00:00:56.500> few<00:00:57.010> strychnine<00:00:57.730> and

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:58.210 
now we are going a few strychnine and

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:08.990 
now we are going a few strychnine and
then<00:00:58.600> one<00:00:58.870> sugar<00:00:59.170> line<00:00:59.590> the<00:01:00.430> emulsification

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.310 

vicious<00:01:10.350> -<00:01:10.740> no<00:01:11.030> not<00:01:12.030> okay<00:01:12.600> on<00:01:13.080> the

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
vicious - no not okay on the

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:29.469 
vicious - no not okay on the
pop-up<00:01:13.590> learning

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:29.479 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:34.289 

now<00:01:30.049> at<00:01:30.229> your<00:01:30.380> circle<00:01:30.950> I<00:01:31.159> do<00:01:32.149> a<00:01:32.299> circle<00:01:32.840> at<00:01:33.049> the

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:34.299 
now at your circle I do a circle at the

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:39.060 
now at your circle I do a circle at the
region<00:01:35.299> the<00:01:35.630> trajectory<00:01:36.200> or<00:01:36.530> region<00:01:36.950> and<00:01:37.600> then

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:39.070 
region the trajectory or region and then

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:43.990 
region the trajectory or region and then
after<00:01:40.070> that<00:01:40.219> I<00:01:40.460> can<00:01:40.969> okay<00:01:41.780> and<00:01:42.110> he<00:01:42.799> will<00:01:43.070> now

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.000 
after that I can okay and he will now

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.990 
after that I can okay and he will now
you<00:01:44.630> can<00:01:44.750> see<00:01:45.079> the<00:01:45.409> final<00:01:45.799> product<00:01:46.189> is<00:01:46.369> the

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.000 
you can see the final product is the

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.779 
you can see the final product is the
circle<00:01:47.569> will<00:01:48.259> move<00:01:48.679> along<00:01:49.039> the<00:01:49.579> trajectory

00:01:49.779 --> 00:01:49.789 
circle will move along the trajectory

00:01:49.789 --> 00:02:05.810 
circle will move along the trajectory
and<00:01:50.659> create<00:01:51.259> a<00:01:51.500> path

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.369 

it<00:02:06.390> is<00:02:06.540> personal<00:02:07.140> and<00:02:07.350> I<00:02:07.590> hope<00:02:07.770> you<00:02:07.920> like<00:02:08.130> that
