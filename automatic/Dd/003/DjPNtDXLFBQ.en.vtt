00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:10.550 
good sort of overall coverage of
actually<00:03:08.850> diamond<00:03:09.270> which<00:03:09.420> I<00:03:09.570> chose<00:03:09.840> her<00:03:10.140> when

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
actually diamond which I chose her when

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.580 
actually diamond which I chose her when
I<00:03:10.650> was<00:03:10.830> spraying<00:03:11.190> and<00:03:11.720> I<00:03:12.720> look<00:03:13.320> at<00:03:13.440> him<00:03:13.530> he

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
I was spraying and I look at him he

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:15.710 
I was spraying and I look at him he
looks<00:03:13.800> pretty<00:03:13.920> good<00:03:14.220> but<00:03:14.280> i<00:03:14.790> think<00:03:15.600> we

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
looks pretty good but i think we

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.420 
looks pretty good but i think we
highlight<00:03:16.050> it<00:03:16.170> has<00:03:16.290> had<00:03:16.530> a<00:03:16.560> little<00:03:16.920> bit<00:03:17.100> maybe

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
highlight it has had a little bit maybe

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.700 
highlight it has had a little bit maybe
made<00:03:17.700> the<00:03:17.820> grass<00:03:18.030> green<00:03:18.450> so<00:03:19.320> here<00:03:19.560> we<00:03:19.590> have

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:19.710 
made the grass green so here we have

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:22.760 
made the grass green so here we have
again<00:03:20.460> some<00:03:21.060> great<00:03:21.270> colors<00:03:21.750> Christmas<00:03:22.500> red

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:22.770 
again some great colors Christmas red

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:25.670 
again some great colors Christmas red
and<00:03:23.490> our<00:03:23.760> green<00:03:24.120> and<00:03:24.690> I<00:03:25.290> think<00:03:25.470> we're<00:03:25.560> just

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
and our green and I think we're just

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.260 
and our green and I think we're just
going<00:03:25.830> to<00:03:25.860> go<00:03:26.070> and<00:03:26.280> give<00:03:26.760> them<00:03:26.910> a<00:03:26.940> good<00:03:27.090> old

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:27.270 
going to go and give them a good old

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:29.180 
going to go and give them a good old
done<00:03:27.510> the<00:03:27.960> old<00:03:28.080> my<00:03:28.320> old-fashioned<00:03:28.950> technique

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
done the old my old-fashioned technique

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:31.910 
done the old my old-fashioned technique
and<00:03:29.960> then<00:03:30.960> we'll<00:03:31.110> just<00:03:31.230> painted<00:03:31.590> it<00:03:31.650> to<00:03:31.710> make

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
and then we'll just painted it to make

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.720 
and then we'll just painted it to make
sure<00:03:32.070> that<00:03:32.250> he<00:03:32.310> looks<00:03:32.490> good<00:03:32.730> we'll<00:03:32.910> do<00:03:33.060> this

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:33.730 
sure that he looks good we'll do this

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:36.059 
sure that he looks good we'll do this
and<00:03:34.050> and<00:03:35.050> then<00:03:35.170> we<00:03:35.260> might<00:03:35.409> just<00:03:35.470> finish<00:03:35.800> up

00:03:36.059 --> 00:03:36.069 
and and then we might just finish up

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:37.589 
and and then we might just finish up
with<00:03:36.280> a<00:03:36.340> little<00:03:36.580> bit<00:03:36.700> of<00:03:36.760> cinnamon<00:03:37.120> just<00:03:37.390> got

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:38.950 
to make the mushroom look like a chip

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:44.520 
to make the mushroom look like a chip
here<00:03:39.760> we<00:03:39.879> go

a little green we'll come back in a
little<00:05:13.759> while<00:05:13.849> I'll<00:05:14.240> just<00:05:14.360> try<00:05:14.659> and<00:05:14.900> see<00:05:15.319> what

00:05:15.489 --> 00:05:15.499 
little while I'll just try and see what

00:05:15.499 --> 00:05:17.469 
little while I'll just try and see what

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:27.820 
there guys back here in the education
room<00:05:24.319> at<00:05:24.499> ranger<00:05:24.889> and<00:05:26.080> you<00:05:27.080> can<00:05:27.229> see<00:05:27.439> my<00:05:27.469> little

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:27.830 
room at ranger and you can see my little

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:29.350 
room at ranger and you can see my little
gnome<00:05:28.069> it's<00:05:28.339> kind<00:05:28.550> of<00:05:28.580> taken<00:05:28.789> on<00:05:29.029> some<00:05:29.240> good

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:29.360 
gnome it's kind of taken on some good

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:33.219 
gnome it's kind of taken on some good
color<00:05:29.599> as<00:05:29.809> you<00:05:29.930> can<00:05:30.110> see<00:05:30.319> and<00:05:31.180> i<00:05:32.180> was<00:05:32.960> looking

00:05:33.219 --> 00:05:33.229 
color as you can see and i was looking

00:05:33.229 --> 00:05:34.659 
color as you can see and i was looking
at<00:05:33.259> though<00:05:33.469> and<00:05:33.680> you<00:05:33.949> know<00:05:34.069> a<00:05:34.099> little<00:05:34.369> too<00:05:34.520> much

00:05:34.659 --> 00:05:34.669 
at though and you know a little too much

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:36.579 
at though and you know a little too much
gold<00:05:34.939> in<00:05:35.089> the<00:05:35.149> front<00:05:35.419> so<00:05:35.719> I<00:05:35.990> thought<00:05:36.529> maybe

00:05:36.579 --> 00:05:36.589 
gold in the front so I thought maybe

00:05:36.589 --> 00:05:38.290 
gold in the front so I thought maybe
would<00:05:36.949> make<00:05:37.129> the<00:05:37.249> mushroom<00:05:37.580> pop<00:05:37.789> a<00:05:37.819> little<00:05:38.119> bit

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:38.300 
would make the mushroom pop a little bit

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:40.269 
would make the mushroom pop a little bit
so<00:05:38.990> I<00:05:39.020> went<00:05:39.169> back<00:05:39.229> in<00:05:39.499> the<00:05:39.589> pick<00:05:39.740> and<00:05:39.860> pack<00:05:40.009> and

00:05:40.269 --> 00:05:40.279 
so I went back in the pick and pack and

00:05:40.279 --> 00:05:42.879 
so I went back in the pick and pack and
I<00:05:40.309> kind<00:05:40.490> of<00:05:40.550> found<00:05:40.729> cinnamon<00:05:41.240> and<00:05:41.800> a<00:05:42.800> little

00:05:42.879 --> 00:05:42.889 
I kind of found cinnamon and a little

00:05:42.889 --> 00:05:44.350 
I kind of found cinnamon and a little
bit<00:05:43.189> great<00:05:43.370> color<00:05:43.610> for<00:05:43.669> the<00:05:43.819> mushroom<00:05:44.089> so

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:44.360 
bit great color for the mushroom so

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:47.290 
bit great color for the mushroom so
let's<00:05:44.809> give<00:05:45.110> that<00:05:45.289> a<00:05:45.319> little<00:05:45.499> go<00:05:45.770> and<00:05:46.009> I<00:05:46.300> might

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:47.300 
let's give that a little go and I might

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:49.059 
let's give that a little go and I might
try<00:05:47.509> a<00:05:47.599> slightly<00:05:48.050> different<00:05:48.349> technique<00:05:48.860> with

00:05:49.059 --> 00:05:49.069 
try a slightly different technique with

00:05:49.069 --> 00:05:52.179 
try a slightly different technique with
this<00:05:49.219> where<00:05:49.490> I'm<00:05:49.610> going<00:05:49.849> to<00:05:50.289> just<00:05:51.289> squirt<00:05:52.069> it

00:05:52.179 --> 00:05:52.189 
this where I'm going to just squirt it

00:05:52.189 --> 00:05:56.110 
this where I'm going to just squirt it
on<00:05:52.719> yet<00:05:53.719> China<00:05:54.339> and<00:05:55.339> then<00:05:55.520> we'll<00:05:55.699> just<00:05:55.849> use<00:05:56.029> our

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:56.120 
on yet China and then we'll just use our

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:57.909 
on yet China and then we'll just use our
fingers<00:05:56.360> to<00:05:56.539> kind<00:05:56.899> of<00:05:56.990> smudge<00:05:57.349> it<00:05:57.499> around<00:05:57.740> a

00:05:57.909 --> 00:05:57.919 
fingers to kind of smudge it around a

00:05:57.919 --> 00:06:08.570 
fingers to kind of smudge it around a
bit

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:08.580 

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:11.390 

I<00:06:09.210> think<00:06:09.870> maybe<00:06:10.259> this<00:06:10.500> little<00:06:10.560> ladybug<00:06:11.159> needs

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:11.400 
I think maybe this little ladybug needs

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:14.149 
I think maybe this little ladybug needs
a<00:06:11.520> little<00:06:11.669> a<00:06:12.139> little<00:06:13.139> revving<00:06:13.620> up<00:06:13.740> as<00:06:13.919> well
