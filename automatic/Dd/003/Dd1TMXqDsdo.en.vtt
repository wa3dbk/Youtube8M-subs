large screens on the face of each of the
three<00:01:02.129> towers<00:01:02.340> you<00:01:02.699> know<00:01:02.760> I<00:01:02.820> was<00:01:02.940> very

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
three towers you know I was very

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.210 
three towers you know I was very
skeptical<00:01:03.660> we<00:01:04.140> were<00:01:04.290> able<00:01:04.409> to<00:01:04.559> go<00:01:04.769> back<00:01:04.949> to<00:01:05.189> the

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
skeptical we were able to go back to the

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.359 
skeptical we were able to go back to the
arkies<00:01:05.729> and<00:01:06.090> say<00:01:06.330> you<00:01:07.140> know<00:01:07.260> could<00:01:07.860> this<00:01:08.070> work

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
arkies and say you know could this work

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.490 
arkies and say you know could this work
and<00:01:08.670> they'd<00:01:08.790> say<00:01:08.820> well<00:01:09.080> yeah<00:01:10.080> but<00:01:10.290> that's

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
and they'd say well yeah but that's

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.710 
and they'd say well yeah but that's
that's<00:01:10.860> going<00:01:11.159> to<00:01:11.220> be<00:01:11.310> really<00:01:11.580> tricky<00:01:11.790> so<00:01:12.299> you

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
that's going to be really tricky so you

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.420 
that's going to be really tricky so you
know<00:01:12.810> what<00:01:13.080> what<00:01:13.500> were<00:01:13.650> you<00:01:13.799> thinking<00:01:14.280> about

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
know what what were you thinking about

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.560 
know what what were you thinking about
how<00:01:14.970> how<00:01:15.689> canted<00:01:16.320> are<00:01:16.619> the<00:01:16.740> columns<00:01:17.220> and<00:01:17.610> you

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
how how canted are the columns and you

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.320 
how how canted are the columns and you
know<00:01:18.689> how<00:01:18.869> far<00:01:19.229> away<00:01:19.380> is<00:01:19.680> the<00:01:19.830> screen<00:01:20.330> pulled

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
know how far away is the screen pulled

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:22.850 
know how far away is the screen pulled
away<00:01:21.450> from<00:01:21.600> the<00:01:21.840> major<00:01:22.020> structure<00:01:22.619> and<00:01:22.770> how

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
away from the major structure and how

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.920 
away from the major structure and how
can<00:01:22.920> we<00:01:23.070> brace<00:01:23.400> this<00:01:23.729> and<00:01:24.030> that<00:01:24.450> from<00:01:24.750> an

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
can we brace this and that from an

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.830 
can we brace this and that from an
engineering<00:01:25.439> standpoint<00:01:25.770> it<00:01:26.250> raised<00:01:26.490> a<00:01:26.970> whole

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
engineering standpoint it raised a whole

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.109 
engineering standpoint it raised a whole
field<00:01:28.110> of<00:01:28.350> concerns<00:01:28.920> and<00:01:29.220> problems<00:01:29.369> that<00:01:29.729> I

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
field of concerns and problems that I

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.030 
field of concerns and problems that I
knew<00:01:30.509> it<00:01:30.570> would<00:01:30.720> be<00:01:30.900> addressed<00:01:31.770> I'm

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
knew it would be addressed I'm

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.520 
knew it would be addressed I'm
essentially<00:01:32.670> a<00:01:32.700> whole<00:01:32.970> nother<00:01:33.810> structure

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
essentially a whole nother structure

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.469 
essentially a whole nother structure
just<00:01:34.860> sort<00:01:35.280> of<00:01:35.310> hanging<00:01:35.610> off<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:36.030> side<00:01:36.240> of<00:01:36.270> our

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
just sort of hanging off the side of our

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.359 
just sort of hanging off the side of our
building<00:01:36.689> in<00:01:37.530> talking<00:01:38.009> with<00:01:38.220> the

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
building in talking with the

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.969 
building in talking with the
architectural<00:01:39.329> engineering<00:01:39.780> students<00:01:40.409> we

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
architectural engineering students we

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.889 
architectural engineering students we
decided<00:01:41.549> that<00:01:41.579> the<00:01:42.119> screens<00:01:42.450> could<00:01:42.720> also

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
decided that the screens could also

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.560 
decided that the screens could also
serve<00:01:43.350> a<00:01:43.680> structural<00:01:44.310> component<00:01:44.939> it<00:01:45.420> was

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
serve a structural component it was

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.289 
serve a structural component it was
really<00:01:46.290> great<00:01:46.700> being<00:01:47.700> an<00:01:47.790> architectural

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
really great being an architectural

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.170 
really great being an architectural
engineer<00:01:49.020> to<00:01:49.290> be<00:01:49.380> able<00:01:49.439> to<00:01:49.619> work<00:01:50.030> with<00:01:51.030> the

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
engineer to be able to work with the

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.139 
engineer to be able to work with the
other<00:01:51.299> discipline<00:01:51.899> and<00:01:52.340> see<00:01:53.340> and<00:01:53.579> hopefully

through the language barriers that we
