00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:04.180
 op 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.560
 I 'm just 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:28.039
 love 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:34.750
 the good so I with my odd skin already 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:36.550
 with sunscreen like I already told 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:40.090
 sometimes I use this sunscreen 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:43.059
 ultra- dry filter is what leaves the 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:47.050
 skin much longer and 

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:51.040
 So I know that my bad baby is here. 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:53.980
 at that time bed for the baby client 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:55.629
 the acne protection factor 20 why 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:57.970
 I use sunscreen before I think 

00:00:55.629 --> 00:01:03.119
 you need to use a protective 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:06.100
 before him also is he promises to 

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:09.880
 coverage leave a natural finish 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:10.960
 it is anti acne moisturizes the skin and does not 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.179
 make proud 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.770
 taste very very good and excellent and 

00:01:13.179 --> 00:01:20.979
 then there 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:23.729
 Ok you check it out, I'll apply one. 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:31.929
 here is a little finger 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:35.259
 so the stadium and support some points 

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:38.470
 Okay, look at his color compared to 

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:43.229
 my skin is it's not a kiss anymore 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:46.810
 it is bumpy as for the frequent and 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:49.560
 more rosy like that 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.560
 al 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:52.890
 when we see 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:07.540
 the spanish well 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:16.280
 so you can see those who have a 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:18.260
 Really nice coverage but it was very natural 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.270
 a very thin layer 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:22.070
 If you want to pick up and put a 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:24.260
 a little more product 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:27.970
 so if I want in some points the 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.970
 I'll pick up here a little bit more 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:33.860
 I come from some agencies I think 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:36.160
 I want a little more than 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.160
 roof 

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:52.480
 then that here I do not know but I think 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:54.190
 does not have tonality is this the only color 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.720
 at least when I went to buy I did not have 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:59.740
 color option 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:02.800
 I bought and it worked 

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:06.640
 my tone I wore even when I was 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:09.490
 A little bit darker, it worked. 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:11.800
 despite giving you coverage until good 

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:14.020
 so it does not look like you 're 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:17.140
 with a product on the skin looks very natural 

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:19.710
 so cool and very soft and so the 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:22.600
 continued sardines today can not 

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:25.390
 sbp it does not have such a high coverage 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:27.430
 point to cover fully all okay and 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:30.610

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:32.710

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:35.380
 Dude, I'll explain myself. 

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:39.540

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:39.540
 the pimples here on the forehead 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:56.190

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:12.870

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:12.870

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:27.630

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:34.170

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:52.750
 corrected on the eyebrow practically 

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.140

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:19.570
