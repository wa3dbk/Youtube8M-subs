00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:11.780
 so prong today with glasses 

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:17.940
 4 inch display is proven bean on and it would 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:21.420
 cost about 600 rubles and the initial 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:27.830
 positioned as a mobile for 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:27.830
 viewing there I omit the rear phenomena 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:44.070
 come such a box here a box 4 3 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:48.390
 inch he warm brazing 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:51.329
 characteristics of its voltage written 27 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:58.609
 here is a DC percentage 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:01:08.520
 let's call it sandy 9 to 35 volts 

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:09.210
 He actually has two entrances 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.540
 million 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:23.930
 Good for the intended purpose and as seen 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:23.930
 Eye than tell the viewing angles from him 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:34.190
 rather sad especially 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:38.680
 vertical slight deflection about 90 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:42.200
 degrees down already started by myself 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:48.710
 quite serious changes at all 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:51.009
 nothing is visible from above 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:57.220
 believes it is enough choice 

00:01:51.009 --> 00:02:02.810
 ok behind the flax umbrella basically 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:05.710
 almost does not change if so what is it 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:08.060
 this is the way fit three goals 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:14.780
 from the bottom he wants to see then he is there 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:21.220
 saw nothing behind there are three 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:24.730
 Multiple language buttons 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.730
 I'll show you later 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:29.040
 bright with contrast and saturation 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:39.609
 took away 

00:02:32.469 --> 00:02:42.579
 This complex relation is called 

00:02:39.609 --> 00:02:43.389
 sides since measure tied black 

00:02:42.579 --> 00:03:10.269
 stripes on the sides 

00:02:43.389 --> 00:03:12.599
 I prefer the great basically everything 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:12.599
 more 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:25.450
 as a display for video mask 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:27.910
 It is acceptable only acceptable 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:30.430
 that he has redone mounting to the wall 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:34.330
 she initially goes from this angle then 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:38.560
 bent him just sawed 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:48.480
 warmed up soldered the world a bit ahead on 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:48.480
 straight such 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:54.800
 all tip 

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:59.920
 all all bye
