00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:02.100 
the specialty customers of mechanics

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.579 
the specialty customers of mechanics
were<00:00:02.220> exposed<00:00:02.700> to<00:00:03.000> extreme<00:00:03.659> environments

00:00:04.579 --> 00:00:04.589 
were exposed to extreme environments

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:06.980 
were exposed to extreme environments
we're<00:00:05.370> talking<00:00:05.790> in<00:00:06.120> the<00:00:06.359> mornings<00:00:06.779> we're

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
we're talking in the mornings we're

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:08.780 
we're talking in the mornings we're
talking<00:00:07.379> the<00:00:07.830> industrial<00:00:08.309> saying<00:00:08.550> where

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
talking the industrial saying where

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.440 
talking the industrial saying where
there's<00:00:08.880> high<00:00:09.510> risk<00:00:10.110> of<00:00:10.320> cut<00:00:10.559> puncture<00:00:11.490> you

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
there's high risk of cut puncture you

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.690 
there's high risk of cut puncture you
name<00:00:12.660> it<00:00:12.840> so<00:00:13.440> mechanics<00:00:14.190> were<00:00:14.280> wanted<00:00:14.549> to

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
name it so mechanics were wanted to

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.570 
name it so mechanics were wanted to
develop<00:00:15.599> a<00:00:15.809> material<00:00:16.440> and<00:00:16.619> address<00:00:17.340> this<00:00:17.520> need

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
develop a material and address this need

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.840 
develop a material and address this need
the<00:00:18.119> directive<00:00:18.930> was<00:00:19.199> to<00:00:19.230> use<00:00:19.650> a<00:00:19.680> material<00:00:20.400> that

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
the directive was to use a material that

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.359 
the directive was to use a material that
was<00:00:21.029> basically<00:00:21.330> indestructible<00:00:21.990> that<00:00:22.980> needed

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
was basically indestructible that needed

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.429 
was basically indestructible that needed
to<00:00:23.400> be<00:00:23.490> cut<00:00:24.060> resistant<00:00:24.689> to<00:00:24.779> puncture<00:00:25.170> proof

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
to be cut resistant to puncture proof

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.790 
to be cut resistant to puncture proof

and have really high abrasion resistance

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.209 
and have really high abrasion resistance
we<00:00:29.460> knew<00:00:29.670> we<00:00:29.699> needed<00:00:30.119> a<00:00:30.630> expert<00:00:31.500> in<00:00:31.740> making

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
we knew we needed a expert in making

brought<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:50.910> problem<00:00:51.329> to<00:00:51.570> us<00:00:51.750> of<00:00:52.199> developing

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
brought the problem to us of developing

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.459 
brought the problem to us of developing
a<00:00:52.920> new<00:00:53.100> material<00:00:53.250> i<00:00:53.989> knew<00:00:54.989> that<00:00:55.020> it<00:00:55.260> would<00:00:55.350> be

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
a new material i knew that it would be

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.680 
a new material i knew that it would be
difficult<00:00:55.680> because<00:00:56.190> great<00:00:56.820> dexterity<00:00:57.120> and

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
difficult because great dexterity and

cut resistance traditionally haven't
gone<00:01:00.000> together<00:01:00.210> i<00:01:00.690> knew<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:01.800> difficulty<00:01:02.460> of

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
gone together i knew the difficulty of

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.700 
gone together i knew the difficulty of
cut<00:01:02.789> resistance<00:01:03.359> that<00:01:03.780> it's<00:01:04.140> got<00:01:04.439> to<00:01:04.559> be<00:01:04.680> a

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
cut resistance that it's got to be a

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.340 
cut resistance that it's got to be a
very<00:01:05.010> tough<00:01:05.280> material<00:01:05.939> when<00:01:06.930> you<00:01:07.049> think<00:01:07.260> about

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
very tough material when you think about

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.289 
very tough material when you think about
soft<00:01:07.860> and<00:01:08.070> flexible<00:01:08.250> and<00:01:08.700> tough<00:01:08.880> they<00:01:09.119> don't

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
soft and flexible and tough they don't

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.109 
soft and flexible and tough they don't
typically<00:01:09.689> go<00:01:09.900> well<00:01:10.140> together<00:01:10.939> one<00:01:11.939> of<00:01:12.060> the

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
typically go well together one of the

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:13.670 
typically go well together one of the
things<00:01:12.270> we<00:01:12.450> were<00:01:12.570> trying<00:01:12.780> to<00:01:12.840> do<00:01:12.990> is<00:01:13.140> build<00:01:13.380> cut

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
things we were trying to do is build cut

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.649 
things we were trying to do is build cut
resistance<00:01:14.220> from<00:01:14.369> multiple<00:01:14.850> angles<00:01:15.030> and<00:01:15.570> as

resistance from multiple angles and as

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.330 
resistance from multiple angles and as
we<00:01:15.869> built<00:01:16.140> this<00:01:16.320> three<00:01:16.590> dimensional<00:01:16.710> fabric

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
we built this three dimensional fabric

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.340 
we built this three dimensional fabric
we<00:01:17.729> were<00:01:17.909> looking<00:01:18.240> at<00:01:18.360> not<00:01:18.869> just<00:01:19.110> traditional

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
we were looking at not just traditional

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.230 
we were looking at not just traditional
cut<00:01:19.950> resistance<00:01:20.460> where<00:01:20.700> you<00:01:20.790> look<00:01:20.970> at<00:01:21.090> the

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
cut resistance where you look at the

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.210 
cut resistance where you look at the
straight<00:01:21.540> planar<00:01:21.869> angle<00:01:22.320> but<00:01:22.770> how<00:01:22.950> would<00:01:23.009> it

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
straight planar angle but how would it

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.399 
straight planar angle but how would it
perform<00:01:23.700> at<00:01:23.880> multiple<00:01:24.360> angles<00:01:24.509> our

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
perform at multiple angles our

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.320 
perform at multiple angles our

three-dimensional construction allowed

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.690 
three-dimensional construction allowed
us<00:01:27.540> to<00:01:27.689> provide<00:01:28.049> cut<00:01:28.350> resistance<00:01:28.920> at<00:01:29.159> multiple

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
us to provide cut resistance at multiple

us to provide cut resistance at multiple
angles<00:01:29.880> which<00:01:30.270> is<00:01:30.450> really<00:01:30.689> a<00:01:30.810> new<00:01:31.049> feature<00:01:31.320> in

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
angles which is really a new feature in

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.850 
angles which is really a new feature in
these<00:01:31.829> type<00:01:32.009> of<00:01:32.040> materials<00:01:33.680> one<00:01:34.680> of<00:01:34.799> the

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
these type of materials one of the

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.770 
these type of materials one of the
problems<00:01:35.220> of<00:01:35.310> using<00:01:35.729> a<00:01:35.909> yarn<00:01:36.180> that's<00:01:36.390> stronger

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
than steel at a traditional knitting

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:39.350 
than steel at a traditional knitting
machine<00:01:38.640> is<00:01:38.790> you've<00:01:38.909> got<00:01:39.060> to<00:01:39.180> worry<00:01:39.299> about

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
machine is you've got to worry about

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.510 
machine is you've got to worry about
breaking<00:01:39.750> parts<00:01:40.380> the<00:01:40.680> yarn<00:01:40.920> doesn't<00:01:41.340> break

breaking parts the yarn doesn't break

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.060 
breaking parts the yarn doesn't break

it<00:01:59.130> would<00:01:59.250> take<00:01:59.460> to<00:01:59.700> give<00:02:00.210> the<00:02:00.329> best<00:02:00.540> cut

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
it would take to give the best cut

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:05.149 
it would take to give the best cut
resistance<00:02:01.380> as<00:02:01.560> well<00:02:01.770> as<00:02:01.920> flexibility<00:02:04.159> right

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
resistance as well as flexibility right

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.069 
resistance as well as flexibility right
now<00:02:05.310> we're<00:02:05.549> in<00:02:05.579> our<00:02:05.880> advanced<00:02:06.210> materials<00:02:06.840> lab

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
now we're in our advanced materials lab

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:10.219 
now we're in our advanced materials lab
in<00:02:07.380> this<00:02:07.890> lab<00:02:08.099> we<00:02:08.129> can<00:02:08.520> prototype<00:02:08.940> any<00:02:09.690> type<00:02:10.200> of

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
in this lab we can prototype any type of

stage does he look at this product the

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:18.980 
stage does he look at this product the
three<00:02:17.550> characteristics<00:02:17.970> we're<00:02:18.450> looking<00:02:18.750> for

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
three characteristics we're looking for

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:21.110 
three characteristics we're looking for
is<00:02:19.110> cut<00:02:19.410> resistance<00:02:20.010> puncture<00:02:20.580> resistance

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
is cut resistance puncture resistance

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.750 
is cut resistance puncture resistance
and<00:02:21.270> abrasion<00:02:21.720> resistance<00:02:22.230> and<00:02:22.440> the<00:02:23.280> cut<00:02:23.490> test

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
and abrasion resistance and the cut test

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.790 
and abrasion resistance and the cut test
is<00:02:24.000> actually<00:02:24.480> just<00:02:24.750> that<00:02:24.930> you<00:02:25.230> use<00:02:25.410> a<00:02:25.440> very

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
is actually just that you use a very

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.130 
is actually just that you use a very
sharp<00:02:25.860> razor<00:02:26.400> but<00:02:27.120> you<00:02:27.300> use<00:02:27.480> a<00:02:27.510> controlled

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
sharp razor but you use a controlled

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:29.960 
sharp razor but you use a controlled
situation<00:02:28.380> with<00:02:29.070> a<00:02:29.100> known<00:02:29.340> amount<00:02:29.520> of<00:02:29.820> weight

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
situation with a known amount of weight

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:31.550 
situation with a known amount of weight
and<00:02:30.000> you're<00:02:30.270> looking<00:02:30.420> at<00:02:30.660> the<00:02:30.810> force<00:02:31.170> that<00:02:31.440> it

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
and you're looking at the force that it

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.270 
and you're looking at the force that it
takes<00:02:31.770> to<00:02:32.220> cut<00:02:32.430> through<00:02:32.670> the<00:02:32.850> fabric<00:02:33.590> on<00:02:34.590> the

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
takes to cut through the fabric on the

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.890 
takes to cut through the fabric on the
puncture<00:02:35.790> resistance<00:02:36.360> it's<00:02:36.570> pretty

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
puncture resistance it's pretty

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.010 
puncture resistance it's pretty
intuitive<00:02:37.230> you're<00:02:37.620> literally<00:02:38.010> looking<00:02:38.490> for

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:39.020 
intuitive you're literally looking for

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.810 
intuitive you're literally looking for
the<00:02:40.020> resistance<00:02:40.590> of<00:02:40.740> the<00:02:40.860> material<00:02:40.890> to<00:02:41.490> keep<00:02:41.670> a

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820 
the resistance of the material to keep a

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:44.000 
the resistance of the material to keep a
small<00:02:42.150> object<00:02:42.660> from<00:02:42.840> penetrating<00:02:43.440> through<00:02:43.590> it

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
small object from penetrating through it

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.190 
small object from penetrating through it
so<00:02:44.220> if<00:02:44.310> you<00:02:44.400> think<00:02:44.430> of<00:02:44.820> an<00:02:45.030> ice<00:02:45.540> pick<00:02:45.930> or

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
so if you think of an ice pick or

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.160 
so if you think of an ice pick or
something<00:02:46.650> on<00:02:46.800> that<00:02:46.980> kind<00:02:47.280> of<00:02:47.400> magnitude<00:02:48.180> and

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
something on that kind of magnitude and

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.290 
something on that kind of magnitude and
then<00:02:49.440> third<00:02:49.860> is<00:02:50.040> abrasion<00:02:50.550> resistance<00:02:51.060> what

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300 
then third is abrasion resistance what

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:52.760 
then third is abrasion resistance what
we're<00:02:51.450> looking<00:02:51.720> for<00:02:51.750> is<00:02:52.110> that<00:02:52.230> the<00:02:52.380> material

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770 
we're looking for is that the material

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:55.610 
we're looking for is that the material
doesn't<00:02:52.950> wear<00:02:53.280> away<00:02:53.400> very<00:02:53.820> quickly<00:02:54.350> and<00:02:55.350> so<00:02:55.530> if

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
doesn't wear away very quickly and so if

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.860 
doesn't wear away very quickly and so if
you<00:02:55.770> think<00:02:55.800> basically<00:02:56.430> like<00:02:56.910> sandpaper<00:02:57.390> we're

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
you think basically like sandpaper we're

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.870 
you think basically like sandpaper we're
looking<00:02:58.200> at<00:02:58.320> how<00:02:58.500> long<00:02:58.950> will<00:02:59.280> it<00:02:59.310> resists

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
looking at how long will it resists

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.180 
looking at how long will it resists
being<00:03:00.030> worn<00:03:00.510> away<00:03:00.720> after<00:03:01.590> they<00:03:01.739> built<00:03:02.070> the

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
being worn away after they built the

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.040 
being worn away after they built the
first<00:03:02.370> prototypes<00:03:03.000> out<00:03:03.239> of<00:03:03.390> this<00:03:03.450> Mikhail<00:03:03.870> I

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.050 
first prototypes out of this Mikhail I

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:05.840 
first prototypes out of this Mikhail I
was<00:03:04.200> really<00:03:04.470> excited<00:03:04.680> to<00:03:04.920> see<00:03:05.070> the<00:03:05.190> glove<00:03:05.370> and

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850 
was really excited to see the glove and

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:07.490 
was really excited to see the glove and
I<00:03:06.209> was<00:03:06.360> happy<00:03:06.630> to<00:03:06.750> see<00:03:06.930> that<00:03:06.959> when<00:03:07.170> you<00:03:07.230> put<00:03:07.410> it

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
I was happy to see that when you put it

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:08.870 
I was happy to see that when you put it
on<00:03:07.590> you<00:03:07.830> could<00:03:07.980> move<00:03:08.190> in<00:03:08.400> and<00:03:08.580> had<00:03:08.700> good

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
on you could move in and had good

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.300 
on you could move in and had good
dexterity<00:03:09.300> knew<00:03:10.230> that<00:03:10.440> the<00:03:10.590> materials<00:03:11.130> were

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
dexterity knew that the materials were

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:12.920 
dexterity knew that the materials were
hot<00:03:11.489> you<00:03:11.610> know<00:03:11.730> cut<00:03:12.030> resistant<00:03:12.570> puncture

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
hot you know cut resistant puncture

hot you know cut resistant puncture
resistant<00:03:13.470> and<00:03:13.700> I<00:03:14.700> was<00:03:15.090> really<00:03:15.360> pleased<00:03:15.630> with

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
resistant and I was really pleased with

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.680 
resistant and I was really pleased with
the<00:03:15.930> way<00:03:15.989> it<00:03:16.110> turned<00:03:16.140> out<00:03:16.500> I<00:03:17.239> took<00:03:18.239> over<00:03:18.600> a<00:03:18.630> year

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
the way it turned out I took over a year

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:20.420 
the way it turned out I took over a year
to<00:03:18.900> develop<00:03:19.140> this<00:03:19.440> cut<00:03:19.680> resistant<00:03:20.040> material

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
to develop this cut resistant material
