they're<00:00:11.660> pretty<00:00:11.809> much<00:00:11.870> all<00:00:11.990> the<00:00:12.080> same<00:00:12.230> I<00:00:12.469> saw

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:12.590 
they're pretty much all the same I saw

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:14.339 
they're pretty much all the same I saw
the<00:00:12.650> lower<00:00:12.860> youtuber<00:00:13.340> he<00:00:13.580> said<00:00:13.790> the<00:00:13.910> order

00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:14.349 
the lower youtuber he said the order

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:17.349 
the lower youtuber he said the order
wouldn't<00:00:15.349> be<00:00:15.410> cheap<00:00:15.620> ones<00:00:15.799> and<00:00:16.160> it<00:00:16.999> worked<00:00:17.239> on

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:17.359 
wouldn't be cheap ones and it worked on

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:19.359 
wouldn't be cheap ones and it worked on
his<00:00:17.480> t4i<00:00:17.869> so<00:00:18.259> just<00:00:18.829> to<00:00:18.890> make<00:00:18.980> sure<00:00:19.039> that<00:00:19.220> this

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.649 
it up and try not so just show you what
the<00:00:23.359> side<00:00:23.569> which<00:00:23.929> is<00:00:24.079> a<00:00:24.109> box<00:00:24.619> whole<00:00:24.800> thing

00:00:25.649 --> 00:00:25.659 
the side which is a box whole thing

00:00:25.659 --> 00:00:34.000 
the side which is a box whole thing
my<00:00:26.659> basic<00:00:27.289> stuff<00:00:27.499> but<00:00:27.649> there<00:00:28.309> we<00:00:28.369> go<00:00:32.530> and<00:00:33.530> we

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:34.010 
my basic stuff but there we go and we

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:42.130 
my basic stuff but there we go and we
have<00:00:34.250> a<00:00:35.050> so<00:00:40.629> there's<00:00:41.629> a<00:00:41.660> little<00:00:41.870> locking

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:42.140 
have a so there's a little locking

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.740 
have a so there's a little locking
mechanism<00:00:42.859> so<00:00:43.280> you<00:00:43.309> can<00:00:43.489> lock<00:00:43.699> it<00:00:44.359> to<00:00:44.539> the

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:44.750 
mechanism so you can lock it to the

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:46.989 
mechanism so you can lock it to the
bottom<00:00:45.019> of<00:00:45.109> the<00:00:45.260> camera<00:00:45.550> on<00:00:46.550> an<00:00:46.699> off<00:00:46.850> switch

out<00:03:00.560> of<00:03:00.590> you<00:03:00.830> t4i<00:03:01.250> or<00:03:01.549> t2i

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
out of you t4i or t2i

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.590 
out of you t4i or t2i
to<00:03:02.299> 300<00:03:03.459> it<00:03:04.459> wasn't<00:03:04.700> very<00:03:04.790> expensive<00:03:04.970> at<00:03:05.239> all

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:05.600 
to 300 it wasn't very expensive at all

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:06.570 
to 300 it wasn't very expensive at all
so<00:03:05.780> you

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:06.580 
so you

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:08.790 
so you
just<00:03:06.850> a<00:03:06.910> little<00:03:07.030> bit<00:03:07.180> more<00:03:07.330> option<00:03:07.900> to<00:03:08.050> put<00:03:08.230> it

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:08.800 
just a little bit more option to put it

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:10.770 
just a little bit more option to put it
definitely<00:03:09.100> adds<00:03:09.250> some<00:03:09.610> weight<00:03:10.360> to<00:03:10.510> it<00:03:10.540> but

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:10.780 
definitely adds some weight to it but

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:12.660 
definitely adds some weight to it but
also<00:03:10.900> this<00:03:11.170> lens<00:03:11.410> is<00:03:11.650> pretty<00:03:11.890> heavy<00:03:12.040> too<00:03:12.280> if

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:12.670 
also this lens is pretty heavy too if

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:14.310 
also this lens is pretty heavy too if
you<00:03:12.790> have<00:03:12.880> any<00:03:12.970> questions<00:03:13.270> or<00:03:13.420> concerns<00:03:13.720> or
