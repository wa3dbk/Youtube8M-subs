00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
types of mic models built into it a

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.750 
types of mic models built into it a
large<00:01:37.350> diaphragm<00:01:37.619> condenser<00:01:37.830> a<00:01:38.430> small

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:38.760 
large diaphragm condenser a small

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:40.340 
large diaphragm condenser a small
diaphragm<00:01:39.030> condenser<00:01:39.330> and<00:01:39.810> a<00:01:39.900> ribbon<00:01:40.080> mic

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
diaphragm condenser and a ribbon mic

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.590 
diaphragm condenser and a ribbon mic
we<00:01:40.950> also<00:01:41.100> have<00:01:41.340> options<00:01:41.760> for<00:01:41.820> focus<00:01:42.299> or<00:01:42.450> wide

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
we also have options for focus or wide

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.170 
we also have options for focus or wide
so<00:01:42.840> that's<00:01:43.020> my<00:01:43.200> mic<00:01:43.619> placement<00:01:43.860> options<00:01:44.490> a

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
so that's my mic placement options a

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.420 
so that's my mic placement options a
resonance<00:01:45.960> control<00:01:46.350> and<00:01:46.590> automatic<00:01:47.250> feedback

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
resonance control and automatic feedback

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:48.800 
resonance control and automatic feedback
reductions<00:01:48.090> so<00:01:48.330> if<00:01:48.390> you're<00:01:48.509> getting<00:01:48.689> some

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
reductions so if you're getting some

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.210 
reductions so if you're getting some
feedback<00:01:48.960> it's<00:01:49.380> real<00:01:49.560> easy<00:01:49.680> just<00:01:49.979> hit<00:01:50.130> the

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
feedback it's real easy just hit the

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.410 
feedback it's real easy just hit the
