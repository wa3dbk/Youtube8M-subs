the<00:01:05.610> detail<00:01:06.000> on<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.330> car<00:01:06.540> is<00:01:06.750> really<00:01:07.200> very

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
the detail on the car is really very

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.350 
the detail on the car is really very
nice<00:01:07.650> got<00:01:08.010> the<00:01:08.130> correct<00:01:08.430> road<00:01:08.670> wheels<00:01:08.939> on<00:01:09.210> it

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
nice got the correct road wheels on it

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.590 
nice got the correct road wheels on it
we<00:01:09.869> put<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.080> BF<00:01:10.350> Goodrich<00:01:10.710> radials<00:01:10.860> EAS<00:01:11.369> on<00:01:11.700> we

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
we put the BF Goodrich radials EAS on we

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.149 
we put the BF Goodrich radials EAS on we
could<00:01:12.780> have<00:01:12.869> done<00:01:12.990> red<00:01:13.290> lines<00:01:13.530> but<00:01:13.860> maybe<00:01:13.979> that

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
could have done red lines but maybe that

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.370 
could have done red lines but maybe that
might<00:01:14.250> have<00:01:14.369> been<00:01:14.460> too<00:01:14.610> much<00:01:14.760> red<00:01:15.140> but<00:01:16.140> I<00:01:16.200> think

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
might have been too much red but I think

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:17.570 
might have been too much red but I think
if<00:01:16.470> you<00:01:16.530> take<00:01:16.650> a<00:01:16.710> walk<00:01:16.920> around<00:01:17.070> the<00:01:17.250> car<00:01:17.400> and

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
if you take a walk around the car and

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.270

obviously<00:01:54.420> is<00:01:54.509> not<00:01:54.630> factory<00:01:55.049> because<00:01:55.229> it's

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
obviously is not factory because it's

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.020

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
that cold this has modern heat in it

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.969 
that cold this has modern heat in it
also<00:02:03.360> and<00:02:04.079> the<00:02:04.200> air<00:02:04.290> conditioning<00:02:04.680> is<00:02:04.829> nice
