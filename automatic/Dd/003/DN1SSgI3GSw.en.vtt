 jet helmets 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.690
 which we have seen so far as 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.170
 you hold it seems like you are not doing anything 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.790
 you have hands 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.920

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.449
 gift to you have the option of one 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.280
 add glasses that are not included 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.930
 but what is included as standard is one 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.280
 light shade visor that we can 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.079
 assemble 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.480
 behind these pictures we take it off 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.579
 and then the visor goes on I have it 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.290
 here just put on a helmet is the 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.990
 room actually do pretty much the same 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.619
 helmet only with very large ones 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:09.180
 vents you get I on 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.920
 caps to close 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.810
 so you want a helmet friends summer with 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.430
 maximum ventilation this might be one 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.250
 better option so we clearly see it 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.200
 visor long visor comes to just below 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.880
 to the children it is a bit colder or 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.250
 right you can see with this type too 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.110
 pilon ride through the light tint filter 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.970
 which is also the sharp of the without ipad 2 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.890
 adjustable positions to the rear is that 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.570
 open it falls nicely over the dish 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:35.009
 so you do it with down 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:36.750
 closing very nice round on this him 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.280
 so there is no ventilation what I like me 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.470
 said the doom does have that ventilation 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.000
 now some air comes through here 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.840
 inside and at the back we also see 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.820
 two out layers 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.770
 so you do not have some ventilation 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.030
 very much because it is a jet helmet 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.979
 Of course all of the breeze in your face 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.320
 is ventilation vignette him anyway 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:54.360
 already know what better fit of this helmet 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.280
 is slightly oval 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.990
 because that ensures if you what 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.640
 have a longer forehead from behind 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.020
 forward side of you about it longer 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.399
 then from left to right that you too 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.150
 well over your head this deed not the 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:06.940
 sticking out 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:10.149
 the lining of this helmet is removable 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:13.270
 anchors are stuck with snaps 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:16.660
 and on the other hand we can do that too 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:19.140
 the entire inside of the bed at once 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:19.140
 clear 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:23.470
 you can easily do it again 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:28.030
 wash it will last longer you stay 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:29.800
 longer hygienic and then we see as we 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:31.570
 we see the lining on the 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:33.250
 inside space sea ​​where the ventilation 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:35.230
 which nevertheless comes a little can 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:36.610
 circulate and can cool 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.800
 it is beautifully finished with leather on the 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:41.950
 inside luxury brown lining that fights 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:43.390
 and sweat draining off and on 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:45.820
 inside we see then stayed here 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:46.900
 ventilation opening it you and through which the 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:48.160
