but<00:03:57.989> sadly<00:03:58.440> just<00:03:58.799> feels<00:03:59.100> dated<00:03:59.400> I<00:03:59.850> can<00:04:00.570> look

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
but sadly just feels dated I can look

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.720 
but sadly just feels dated I can look
past<00:04:00.930> the<00:04:01.140> old-school<00:04:01.560> cartoony<00:04:02.130> graphics<00:04:02.220> as

past the old-school cartoony graphics as

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:05.000 
past the old-school cartoony graphics as
it<00:04:03.060> just<00:04:03.239> adds<00:04:03.420> character<00:04:03.630> but<00:04:04.590> for<00:04:04.769> me<00:04:04.860> the

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.010 
it just adds character but for me the

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:07.670 
it just adds character but for me the
game<00:04:05.190> lacks<00:04:05.400> any<00:04:05.549> real<00:04:05.700> content<00:04:06.410> while<00:04:07.410> I<00:04:07.440> am
