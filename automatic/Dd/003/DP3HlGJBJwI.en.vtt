00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
found in a Maryland we've drawn up the

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.120 
found in a Maryland we've drawn up the
spine<00:00:13.080> in<00:00:13.230> the<00:00:13.290> first<00:00:13.500> segment<00:00:13.650> now<00:00:13.920> we're

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
spine in the first segment now we're

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.990 
spine in the first segment now we're
gonna<00:00:14.280> draw<00:00:14.639> a<00:00:15.289> line<00:00:16.289> that<00:00:17.250> goes<00:00:17.310> all<00:00:17.550> the<00:00:17.760> way

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
gonna draw a line that goes all the way

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:31.429 
gonna draw a line that goes all the way
through<00:00:25.310> let's<00:00:26.310> try<00:00:26.519> our<00:00:26.670> on<00:00:27.000> the<00:00:27.119> line<00:00:30.439> I'm

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
through let's try our on the line I'm

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:41.530 
through let's try our on the line I'm
just<00:00:31.560> buying<00:00:31.980> like<00:00:32.219> this

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:41.540 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:44.530 

actually<00:00:42.350> ice<00:00:42.440> which<00:00:42.710> depends<00:00:43.250> on<00:00:43.370> best<00:00:44.300> use

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:44.540 
actually ice which depends on best use

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:49.440 
actually ice which depends on best use
pencil<00:00:44.870> in<00:00:44.960> this<00:00:45.080> case

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:49.450 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:55.350 

let's<00:00:49.989> turn<00:00:50.170> trying<00:00:50.559> a<00:00:50.739> ribbon<00:00:54.360> that's

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:55.360 
let's turn trying a ribbon that's

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:04.960 
let's turn trying a ribbon that's
equidistant<00:00:56.110> from<00:00:56.170> your<00:00:56.500> spine<00:00:56.860> like<00:00:57.309> this

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:04.970 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.710 

it<00:01:05.720> just<00:01:05.930> follows<00:01:06.650> the<00:01:06.680> spine<00:01:07.630> it's<00:01:08.630> gonna

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:08.720 
it just follows the spine it's gonna

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:10.090 
it just follows the spine it's gonna
show<00:01:08.930> you<00:01:08.960> the<00:01:09.080> quick<00:01:09.260> way<00:01:09.380> but<00:01:09.590> probably<00:01:09.920> the

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:10.100 
show you the quick way but probably the

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:19.210 
show you the quick way but probably the
short<00:01:10.670> way<00:01:10.790> is<00:01:10.940> probably<00:01:11.240> the<00:01:11.360> best<00:01:11.510> idea<00:01:18.220> the

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:19.220 
short way is probably the best idea the

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:23.230 
short way is probably the best idea the
short<00:01:19.520> of<00:01:19.790> being<00:01:20.000> the<00:01:20.180> long<00:01:20.390> of<00:01:20.570> course<00:01:22.240> there

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:23.240 
short of being the long of course there

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.740 
short of being the long of course there
now<00:01:24.160> let's<00:01:25.160> draw<00:01:25.400> a<00:01:25.430> ribbon<00:01:25.850> that<00:01:25.970> goes<00:01:26.030> on<00:01:26.480> the

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:26.750 
now let's draw a ribbon that goes on the

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:40.480 
now let's draw a ribbon that goes on the
other<00:01:26.900> side<00:01:27.260> of<00:01:27.290> your<00:01:27.470> spine<00:01:31.810> like<00:01:32.810> so<00:01:39.490> it's

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 
other side of your spine like so it's

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:42.160 
other side of your spine like so it's
okay<00:01:40.820> to<00:01:40.880> be<00:01:41.060> rough<00:01:41.300> and<00:01:41.510> if<00:01:41.660> your<00:01:41.810> Russian

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:42.170 
okay to be rough and if your Russian

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:46.150 
okay to be rough and if your Russian
Asst<00:01:43.120> but<00:01:44.500> you'll<00:01:45.500> probably<00:01:45.620> have<00:01:45.920> to<00:01:45.950> draw

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:46.160 
Asst but you'll probably have to draw

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:47.860 
Asst but you'll probably have to draw
this<00:01:46.370> several<00:01:46.640> times<00:01:46.790> in<00:01:47.300> order<00:01:47.360> to<00:01:47.510> get<00:01:47.720> it<00:01:47.840> to

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:47.870 
this several times in order to get it to

00:01:47.870 --> 00:02:04.860 
this several times in order to get it to
be<00:01:48.080> perfect

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:04.870 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:07.330 

now<00:02:05.870> what<00:02:06.409> we're<00:02:06.560> gonna<00:02:06.650> do<00:02:06.920> is<00:02:07.040> we're<00:02:07.250> gonna

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
now what we're gonna do is we're gonna

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.440 
now what we're gonna do is we're gonna
start<00:02:07.750> inking<00:02:08.750> around<00:02:09.140> this
