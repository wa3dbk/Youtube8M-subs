00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.560
 guys all welcomed where all of her 

00:00:05.399 --> 00:00:09.750
 you can see our next car 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.520
 for firewood from this particular tree 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.129
 Coal Why we did sharks 

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:16.250
 why such a large scale let's 

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:19.230
 come closer face soup was visible hotel 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:20.790
 well you could hide all this luggage 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.440
 no she always could 

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:24.390
 fit not big balloon 

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:26.910
 filter compact but we did more 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.670
 What is the reason for this? 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.350
 tasked to do 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:33.899
 the device on the 3 local coal as sand 

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:36.239
 pay attention azanni not rotar and 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:39.989
 charcoal working on 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:42.539
 pieces ranging in size from 6 to 20 millimeters and 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:45.030
 trivia content less than 6 millimeters 

00:00:42.539 --> 00:00:46.769
 less than 5 percent acceptable but was 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.940
 the task is to make it perfectly 

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:51.420
 on this one 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:53.969
 charcoal which in principle is not 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:57.030
 recommend it clogs everything clogs up like 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:59.719
 would that be who we coped with this task 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.499
 and it turned out so that's 

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:03.809
 an experimental model would be on it 

00:01:01.499 --> 00:01:06.810
 we have traveled here and now we can 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.670
 build on a big installation on 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.810
 generating problems there now 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:14.520
 arise and a person has such 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.719
 dry distillation apparatus so wood 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.460
 called Hindus 

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:19.619
 they are bought from them every hour 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.229
 falls out in such a cough 250 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.869
 kilogram here it is necessary to put them somewhere 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:27.899
 I understand by communication a lot of people 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:30.930
 and all and do not know how this wood 

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:32.549
 charcoal 5 porridge sprite we try after 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.540
 an experimental model to do 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.910
 big so 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.640
 In principle, everything is ok and on charcoal and 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:40.590
 rides on will lie to us here clutched 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.360
 done very high quality therefore 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:46.640
 power was high smartest 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.640
 gas cooling had shadrina 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.980
 graduate 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.160
 double and thank you all bye bye
