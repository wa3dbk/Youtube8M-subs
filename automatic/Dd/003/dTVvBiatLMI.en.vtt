00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.859
 pina, I do not know if this is how it will do it but not 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.650
 I do not know 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:28.439
 So we're going to make that perfume. 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.539
 that the man did not ask me to do that 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:34.079
 There are people who have a lot of 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.430
 perfumes gave né magentis a film that 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.570
 it's not van's 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.800
 I'll explain to you so we can 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:43.800
 advance in the campaign says that I 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.980
 I lost 10 18 for this if I'm not mistaken. 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:50.820
 I lost 18 Aug has partnered with 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:54.570
 company called cot package the coaching 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:59.250
 but the companies only opened perfumes of the 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:02.309
 I know adidas playboy since beck and 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.140
 several other famous ones there and several others 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.710
 brands that are well known here in the 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:10.380
 Brazil also apart so let's do the 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:13.770
 campaign 18 and the first perfume that 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:18.390
 released was the liner and the band 's year 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:21.330
 Smoke is fine as well. 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.490
 different from Avon's perfume there 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:27.450
 many people who have our doubts and 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:29.070
 this movie is good then the 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:34.890
 people are going to tell my opinion to you 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:38.549
 It's the first time I see perfume I 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:41.100
 already look at this era of avon if it was not 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:43.020
 thick was not even expect no 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.650
 has avon name here in the box does not have 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.710
 it was not possible 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:48.540
 the perfume glass is not from the van then 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.710
 of the company thing that the van did 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.690
 partnership 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.420
 so we do not just have a perfume 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:56.460
 How many playboy's here I'll do 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:01.320
 an example here in this magazine gave the 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:04.800
 2011 campaign will have these perfumes 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:07.110
 here are they going to leave here too 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:09.540
 I do not know what's on the campaign but I'm going to release 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.649
 this look for the bank to make partnership 

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:19.860
 so i 'll do it 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:24.480
 I prayed to you and 6/2 adidas has the 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:25.410
 of the island and has a male 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.060
 playboy 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:32.540
 then these perfumes were passed and 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:37.950
 The one I'm going to show you now. 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:41.970
 is to wait and show you the first 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:44.700
 that launched people was the one of the band 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:48.690
 Where did I tell you this? 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:50.310
 here is the lining and this movie is what 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:52.769
 I 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:54.600
 it is quite a smelly 20 but you preferred 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:58.260
 of other brands 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:03:01.800
 so the good people this perfume is that the 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:04.769
 his box is so super cute that 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:07.260
 Are you seeing super crafted box 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:09.150
 I had details I found super beautiful I 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.670
 I bought more people, you speak the truth to 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:14.820
 you by the packaging than by the smell 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:18.590
 because it 's you who gave me there 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:21.720
 prejudice and I started bad and such 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:24.390
 but I bought it so I took the risk 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:31.709
 perfume is so people is the beautiful perfume 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:33.830
 very beautiful, look, I've picked it up here. 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:37.590
 Focusing there for you to see right. 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:40.260
 but I have been born here in the back 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:43.530
 Your name is playboy, I do not know if you can see. 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:46.200
 because it's dark but it tunes well 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:48.600
 light and the smell of it is wonderful 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:50.549
 Where can you buy I do not have? 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:53.010
 afraid to buy it because the smell is 

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:55.079
 very good if you like to see more 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:58.549
 strong it will not be good for you 

00:03:55.079 --> 00:04:02.220
 not very light perfume 

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:04.200
 I found it very soft and light so nothing 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:05.190
 see with your family they go because I eat 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:07.109
 come from the van 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:09.090
 I already know some perfumes they used in the 

00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:11.880
 so I know this is the time too 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:14.940
 It's different they gave different smell 

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:17.280
 the fragrance is right but he is so henrique 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:19.290
 It's very beautiful and it's very generous. 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:22.169
 I will not tell you no perfume 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:25.290
 You pass it all, it's a good movie. 

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:27.330
 gentle and discreet and I like perfume 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:31.560
 so I do not like to stay here so much 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:35.850
 strong then know this positive moment 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:41.340
 For me, that's why I'm going to talk about it. 

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:43.139
 fragrance that the fragrance is 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:46.620
 developed in france, 

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:51.060
 I noticed some things and the works have 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:54.870
 bad and has all woody pineapple sticks 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:57.360
 back resins took uberlândia nor in 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:05:00.690
 wood whether pt or dem and co 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:02.810
 So these are the notes of this dance. 

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:06.300
 so we do not have anything to talk about anymore 

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:09.660
 about this perfume just to say that it is good and 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:12.300
 that I was not afraid and that it is a 

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:14.669
 partnership even though she made corpus a cut 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:17.400
 and will have several other releases of 

00:05:14.669 --> 00:05:21.480
 perfumes like you and the 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:23.910
 buy several places and I loved people there 

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:27.300
 in the packaging that is a little grace is not much 

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:29.699
 cute collects pretty dressing table 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:32.190
 Well folks, that's it, I hope so. 

00:05:29.699 --> 00:05:33.750
 that you liked but it's super 

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:37.550
 simple do not have much to 

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:37.550
 talk about perfume because 

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:45.039
 So that's the love thing and it was a lot of you. 

00:05:42.099 --> 00:05:46.810
