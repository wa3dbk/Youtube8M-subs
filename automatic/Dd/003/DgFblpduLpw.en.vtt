00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
they are a little expensive and I think

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.420 
they are a little expensive and I think
you're<00:01:12.750> getting<00:01:12.870> harder<00:01:13.470> time<00:01:13.830> so<00:01:14.130> you<00:01:14.250> can

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
you're getting harder time so you can

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.570 
you're getting harder time so you can
look<00:01:14.520> at<00:01:14.700> fabric<00:01:14.910> stores<00:01:15.450> and<00:01:16.340> maybe<00:01:17.340> there's

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
look at fabric stores and maybe there's

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.730 
look at fabric stores and maybe there's
someone<00:01:17.910> in<00:01:18.090> your<00:01:18.330> town<00:01:18.690> or<00:01:18.720> city<00:01:19.200> that<00:01:19.530> does

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
someone in your town or city that does

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
your fabric in you're waiting for a

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:42.950 
your fabric in you're waiting for a
table<00:01:41.640> you're<00:01:41.970> waiting<00:01:42.360> for<00:01:42.390> an<00:01:42.690> iron

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
table you're waiting for an iron

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.870 
table you're waiting for an iron
sometimes<00:01:43.560> you<00:01:43.740> have<00:01:43.860> to<00:01:44.010> share<00:01:44.310> a<00:01:44.340> sewing

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
sometimes you have to share a sewing

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.140 
sometimes you have to share a sewing
machine<00:01:45.030> and<00:01:46.070> I've<00:01:47.070> the<00:01:47.280> biggest<00:01:47.640> problem<00:01:48.030> I

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:48.150 
machine and I've the biggest problem I

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:50.270 
machine and I've the biggest problem I
think<00:01:48.420> is<00:01:48.600> that<00:01:48.630> your<00:01:48.990> instructor<00:01:49.740> is<00:01:49.770> very

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
think is that your instructor is very

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.240 
think is that your instructor is very
busy<00:01:50.730> so<00:01:51.330> when<00:01:51.690> you<00:01:51.840> have<00:01:52.050> a<00:01:52.080> question<00:01:52.650> you're

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
busy so when you have a question you're

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.000 
busy so when you have a question you're
waiting<00:01:53.700> for<00:01:53.940> an<00:01:54.060> answer<00:01:54.330> and<00:01:54.900> that's<00:01:55.710> not

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:56.010 
waiting for an answer and that's not

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:58.160 
waiting for an answer and that's not
always<00:01:56.370> very<00:01:56.640> conducive<00:01:57.120> to<00:01:57.420> a<00:01:57.690> good<00:01:57.900> learning

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
always very conducive to a good learning

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.040 
always very conducive to a good learning
environment<00:01:58.550> so<00:01:59.550> the<00:01:59.730> online<00:02:00.150> classes<00:02:00.510> are

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:01.050 
environment so the online classes are

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:04.940 
environment so the online classes are
good<00:02:01.860> because<00:02:02.250> you<00:02:02.970> get<00:02:03.180> to<00:02:03.360> learn<00:02:03.740> when<00:02:04.740> you

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
good because you get to learn when you

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.460 
good because you get to learn when you
want<00:02:05.220> to<00:02:05.340> when<00:02:06.120> you<00:02:06.330> have<00:02:06.600> the<00:02:06.810> time<00:02:07.020> and<00:02:07.080> you

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:07.470 
want to when you have the time and you

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:09.680 
want to when you have the time and you
don't<00:02:07.590> have<00:02:07.710> to<00:02:08.039> hire<00:02:08.310> a<00:02:08.340> babysitter<00:02:08.700> you<00:02:09.300> can

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
don't have to hire a babysitter you can

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.180 
don't have to hire a babysitter you can
do<00:02:09.840> it<00:02:09.959> at<00:02:10.050> any<00:02:10.200> time<00:02:10.530> of<00:02:10.709> the<00:02:10.739> day<00:02:10.830> or<00:02:11.160> night

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
do it at any time of the day or night

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.680 
do it at any time of the day or night
whenever<00:02:12.000> you<00:02:12.390> have<00:02:12.630> the<00:02:12.840> time<00:02:14.450> there<00:02:15.450> are

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
whenever you have the time there are

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.190 
whenever you have the time there are
some<00:02:16.050> other<00:02:16.260> classes<00:02:16.980> online<00:02:17.460> and<00:02:18.360> I<00:02:18.810> think

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
some other classes online and I think

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.410 
some other classes online and I think
some<00:02:19.440> of<00:02:19.530> them<00:02:19.710> are<00:02:19.860> excellent<00:02:20.340> the<00:02:20.850> problem<00:02:21.300> I

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
some of them are excellent the problem I

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.480 
some of them are excellent the problem I
see<00:02:21.750> with<00:02:21.780> them<00:02:22.260> though<00:02:22.500> is<00:02:22.710> that<00:02:22.740> they<00:02:23.310> are

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:23.490 
see with them though is that they are

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:26.060 
see with them though is that they are
for<00:02:24.240> more<00:02:24.420> advanced<00:02:24.840> students<00:02:25.590> they<00:02:25.770> aren't

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070 
for more advanced students they aren't

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:28.970 
for more advanced students they aren't
specifically<00:02:26.820> for<00:02:27.330> beginner<00:02:27.780> tours<00:02:28.320> they

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
specifically for beginner tours they

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.700 
specifically for beginner tours they
have<00:02:29.220> very<00:02:29.490> advanced<00:02:30.390> language<00:02:31.260> so<00:02:31.560> they're

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:31.710 
have very advanced language so they're

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:33.440 
have very advanced language so they're
giving<00:02:32.010> you<00:02:32.100> a<00:02:32.130> lot<00:02:32.400> of<00:02:32.430> terms<00:02:32.820> that<00:02:33.030> you<00:02:33.270> may

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
giving you a lot of terms that you may

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.900 
giving you a lot of terms that you may
not<00:02:33.660> understand<00:02:34.380> I've<00:02:35.100> developed<00:02:35.580> these

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
not understand I've developed these

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:39.770 
not understand I've developed these
classes<00:02:36.690> so<00:02:37.680> that<00:02:37.860> the<00:02:38.040> projects<00:02:38.819> are<00:02:39.000> built

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
classes so that the projects are built

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.290 
classes so that the projects are built
upon<00:02:39.990> the<00:02:40.400> sample<00:02:41.400> techniques<00:02:41.880> that<00:02:42.120> you've

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
upon the sample techniques that you've

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.630 
upon the sample techniques that you've
done<00:02:42.510> during<00:02:42.780> the<00:02:43.050> week<00:02:43.080> and<00:02:43.500> that<00:02:44.310> way<00:02:44.580> you

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
done during the week and that way you

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.940 
done during the week and that way you
already<00:02:45.330> know<00:02:45.600> how<00:02:45.930> to<00:02:45.960> do<00:02:46.260> it<00:02:46.410> because<00:02:46.590> you've

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
already know how to do it because you've

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.550 
already know how to do it because you've
already<00:02:47.190> made<00:02:47.550> a<00:02:47.610> sample<00:02:48.060> and<00:02:48.480> I<00:02:49.050> wanted<00:02:49.380> to

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
already made a sample and I wanted to

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.800 
already made a sample and I wanted to
show<00:02:49.830> you<00:02:49.860> the<00:02:50.340> type<00:02:50.580> of<00:02:50.790> samples<00:02:51.330> that<00:02:51.540> you'll

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
show you the type of samples that you'll

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.170 
show you the type of samples that you'll
be<00:02:51.930> doing<00:02:52.340> you're<00:02:53.340> going<00:02:53.550> to<00:02:53.670> be<00:02:53.790> making<00:02:53.970> a

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
be doing you're going to be making a

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.660 
be doing you're going to be making a
book<00:02:54.510> you'll<00:02:55.020> take<00:02:55.260> a<00:02:55.290> scrap<00:02:55.740> of<00:02:55.950> fabric<00:02:56.190> and

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
book you'll take a scrap of fabric and

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.059 
book you'll take a scrap of fabric and
you<00:02:56.730> actually<00:02:57.000> try<00:02:57.450> to<00:02:57.540> technique<00:02:58.260> on<00:02:58.530> a<00:02:58.560> spare

00:02:59.059 --> 00:02:59.069 
you actually try to technique on a spare

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:01.430 
you actually try to technique on a spare
piece<00:02:59.370> of<00:02:59.580> fabric<00:02:59.819> and<00:03:00.210> then<00:03:00.690> put<00:03:00.990> it<00:03:01.080> into

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
piece of fabric and then put it into

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.770 
piece of fabric and then put it into
your<00:03:01.590> very<00:03:01.860> own<00:03:02.010> book<00:03:02.430> it's<00:03:03.030> got<00:03:03.300> complete

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
your very own book it's got complete

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.870 
your very own book it's got complete
instructions<00:03:04.590> in<00:03:04.800> a<00:03:04.860> place<00:03:05.130> for<00:03:05.400> you<00:03:05.520> to<00:03:05.640> put

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
instructions in a place for you to put

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.059 
instructions in a place for you to put
that<00:03:06.090> and<00:03:06.330> the<00:03:06.810> reason<00:03:07.230> I<00:03:07.319> like<00:03:07.530> the<00:03:07.800> sample

00:03:08.059 --> 00:03:08.069 
that and the reason I like the sample

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:11.170 
that and the reason I like the sample
book<00:03:08.459> is<00:03:08.790> that<00:03:08.880> you<00:03:09.690> can<00:03:09.930> use<00:03:10.230> this<00:03:10.560> after

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:11.180 
book is that you can use this after

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:14.690 
book is that you can use this after
you've<00:03:12.500> after<00:03:13.500> you've<00:03:13.620> done<00:03:13.920> for<00:03:14.250> a<00:03:14.280> while<00:03:14.370> you

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
you've after you've done for a while you

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.730 
you've after you've done for a while you
may<00:03:14.880> forget<00:03:15.150> how<00:03:15.480> to<00:03:15.540> do<00:03:15.780> a<00:03:15.810> certain<00:03:16.140> technique

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:16.740 
may forget how to do a certain technique

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:19.130 
may forget how to do a certain technique
this<00:03:17.430> allows<00:03:17.790> you<00:03:18.090> to<00:03:18.209> go<00:03:18.360> back<00:03:18.569> and<00:03:18.840> you<00:03:18.930> say

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
this allows you to go back and you say

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:21.530 
this allows you to go back and you say
oh<00:03:19.319> I<00:03:19.620> did<00:03:19.950> that<00:03:20.130> technique<00:03:20.610> before<00:03:20.880> I<00:03:21.120> know<00:03:21.360> I

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
oh I did that technique before I know I

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:24.260 
oh I did that technique before I know I
can<00:03:21.900> do<00:03:22.020> it<00:03:22.050> again<00:03:22.470> so<00:03:23.220> that's<00:03:23.400> why<00:03:23.700> the<00:03:23.760> sample

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:24.270 
can do it again so that's why the sample

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:27.170 
can do it again so that's why the sample
book<00:03:24.420> is<00:03:24.600> great<00:03:24.900> but<00:03:25.620> once<00:03:26.550> you've<00:03:26.819> learned

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
book is great but once you've learned

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:30.380 
book is great but once you've learned
and<00:03:27.540> done<00:03:28.110> the<00:03:28.260> samples<00:03:28.770> for<00:03:29.160> from<00:03:30.060> the<00:03:30.180> weekly

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.390 
and done the samples for from the weekly

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:33.800 
and done the samples for from the weekly
emails<00:03:30.959> then<00:03:31.920> you<00:03:32.280> have<00:03:32.670> exactly<00:03:33.420> the<00:03:33.540> skills

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
emails then you have exactly the skills

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:35.690 
emails then you have exactly the skills
you<00:03:34.080> need<00:03:34.290> to<00:03:34.349> make<00:03:34.770> the<00:03:34.950> project<00:03:35.190> that's

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
you need to make the project that's

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.050 
you need to make the project that's
given<00:03:36.120> at<00:03:36.270> the<00:03:36.420> end<00:03:36.599> of<00:03:36.720> the<00:03:36.870> month<00:03:37.819> there<00:03:38.819> are

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
given at the end of the month there are

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.120 
given at the end of the month there are
a<00:03:39.209> lot<00:03:39.420> of<00:03:39.450> people<00:03:39.990> that<00:03:40.170> say<00:03:40.410> they<00:03:40.590> just<00:03:40.890> don't

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 
a lot of people that say they just don't

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:44.030 
a lot of people that say they just don't
have<00:03:41.340> the<00:03:41.459> time<00:03:41.819> to<00:03:42.209> do<00:03:42.450> this<00:03:42.720> but<00:03:43.140> the<00:03:43.830> way<00:03:44.010> I
