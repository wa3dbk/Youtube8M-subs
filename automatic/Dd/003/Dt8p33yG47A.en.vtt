00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:05.860
 all right 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:11.590
 two 

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:14.490
 guys, how are you and how are you today? 

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:18.070
 I bring a very cool house that is very 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:20.050
 modernist and super easy to do as 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:22.090
 you can see is a good octagon a 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:25.330
 octagon species wrong done but one 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:27.310
 kind of octagon and good the way 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:29.170
 it is very cool to play also is 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:31.690
 very practical because you can go giving it 

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:35.400
 go around the house quietly and 

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:38.280
 you have all all on screen no 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:41.150
 and hey you have these super windows for 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.350
 that between all the natural light 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:47.609
 Y 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:50.190
 when the idea came from a plane of a 

00:00:47.609 --> 00:00:52.829
 round house that I do not remember very 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.050
 well how it was but it was similar to this one and 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.449
 I thought it was a chulada that house 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:02.100
 although you are only for two people but 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:04.649
 it's super cool and then I draw it 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.190
 a little bit and I decided to make my own 

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:10.259
 model that is the one you are seeing here 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:11.850
 the best thing about the class is that it's super 

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:13.710
 simple to do good already you are 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:17.039
 seeing is that they are four walls 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:20.159
 counted and everything else is a space 

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:21.720
 open and that furnished as you are 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:26.550
 seeing as it gives a feeling of 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:28.740
 modernity very very cool lav in the 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:30.780
 kitchen I always like to put islands like 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.090
 good other blocks that are there in 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.890
 medium because the feeling that it is a 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.310
 closed space but at the same time it's very 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.159
 open 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:41.770
 and it looks very good the table and the 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:43.869
 chairs are small because it's a house 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:47.500
 thought for everyone and good if you have 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:51.220
 invited then 4 not then already with that 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:53.380
 it was enough for the dining room it cost me a 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:56.500
 little think how to organize it and in the end 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:58.450
 decided that as it is a modern house and 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:01.929
 all that because I was not going to put television 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:05.920
 simply the sofas without every two one 

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:09.549
 with another and good always combining with 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:13.019
 white and brown and well then that 

00:02:09.549 --> 00:02:16.450
 the lights these are that way 

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:19.450
 modernists and nothing to decorate a little 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:22.870
 walls and such always a very very style 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:25.239
 simple as you see is not very ornate 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:28.690
 of furniture is a very open space 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:31.690
 all white and there are hardly any flowers 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:33.849
 and some pictures and that's it for you to see 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:37.900
 that if this house you can do it in 10 

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:39.670
 minutes 15 minutes maximum your presence 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.049
 and with which something strange has happened that 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:44.189
 is that the windows when I put them 

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:45.970
 on the sides they have been made as 

00:02:44.189 --> 00:02:48.099
 horizontals in it have been made more 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:50.409
 big and then I could put curtains 

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:53.620
 in all the windows or later in the most 

00:02:50.409 --> 00:02:56.109
 small and now we go to the bedroom 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:59.200
 that put these tables that found 

00:02:56.109 --> 00:03:01.209
 I think I've never seen them and I 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.939
 they have looked very modern like that white 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:06.970
 with this strange shape and nothing a 

00:03:03.939 --> 00:03:09.609
 comfortable everything everything very normal what 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:13.810
 could you just put it 

00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:15.609
 where flowers are good and such a 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:18.860
 picture and you already have a room that is 

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:23.060
 sad because of the way he has 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:25.780
 the window of that big that good super 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:25.780
 easy to do 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:30.500
 and here goes the bathroom that although it seems to you 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:32.870
 that has a weird way I love it 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:35.660
 this bathroom because all the pieces 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:38.360
 fit is that perfection is left 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:41.270
 very very modernist and very elegant the 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:43.340
 bathroom by the large mirror clearance and 

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:45.440
 now the bathtub is square to the 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:50.420
 perfection or it gives you a very 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:53.540
 large between the toilet and the bathtub and 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:57.130
 that gives a super-large bathroom is like 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:59.960
 super super nice hotel bathroom 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:01.460
 and also how good is that the spaces 

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:06.040
 then there was everyone as a kind of 

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:08.049
 loft this house but in super large 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:09.900
 and nothing here goes to the desk that I 

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:12.900
 I always put desks in the houses 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:14.620
 this is more normal, they are not 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:18.039
 modernists you see that they cost 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:20.590
 desks and with drawers and everything and good 

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:23.320
 a little bit of all the painting and the 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:26.199
 books and such to create a space like 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:28.919
 of relaxation to read and no longer so 

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:32.139
 white that that would already see headache 

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:34.090
 warmer a more expensive space good 

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:36.910
 for this would be general the house as it has 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:39.009
 stayed and now good I'm going for the 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:41.259
 roof because the roof also in a 

00:04:39.009 --> 00:04:44.289
 octagonal house is a little is important 

00:04:41.259 --> 00:04:46.180
 and good the truth is that with the roofs 

00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:49.389
 automatic that has been left to all 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:53.800
 possible ways and finally look at me 

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:56.139
 I decide for this one not tonight and I've 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:57.970
 painted a bit then pulling to follow and 

00:04:56.139 --> 00:05:00.160
 it's because clear white gray is more 

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:02.919
 modernist good has left me a lot 

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:04.660
 of space outside so you see it and 

00:05:02.919 --> 00:05:07.810
 well I decide to do a bit of 

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:09.070
 jardincito vale you know that to me 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:12.160
 love the 

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:14.740
 the grass is super green so I've 

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:16.630
 covered everything and well let's make a 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:19.450
 very simple garden that becomes very very 

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:21.460
 fast, it's good first, let's put 

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:25.570
 This caminito stone at the entrance 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:28.780
 that also gives a very modernist touch and 

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:33.660
 nothing put a couple of a couple of trees 

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:33.660
 very easy 

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:38.030
 and good to finish well to put the 

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:40.340
 trees and such as all how many 

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:42.650
 progresses on the foot and started 

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:46.010
 blue combined super well with pink 

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:47.360
 this so precious of these trees and 

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:49.190
 It is also that with super good together 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:51.230
 with the house style house and everything 

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:53.270
 and well he wants back I've seen that there 

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:55.210
 a huge space so if you want 

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:58.160
 this house support you can do with 

00:05:55.210 --> 00:06:00.350
 a super small solar you can see it no 

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:02.210
 you need a lot so big to not 

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:04.190
 be that you want to make garden and pool and 

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:08.150
 all that I have decided to make a 

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:11.060
 small garden behind not very large 

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:14.570
 I'm just going to put this on the 

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:16.790
 fence is the chairs and what for 

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:19.550
 do barbecue and such not to complete 

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:21.170
 a little the house not but good that 

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:24.050
 you can do what you want pool or 

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:26.240
 columbia or whatever I have put 

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:29.220
 these sunflowers that is that I love 

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:32.260
 how they are are super super fun 

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:35.950
 and nothing hammocks 

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:39.190
 for your children to take the sun and such and 

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:40.600
 this would be the whole garden and I would 

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:41.950
 I could have worked a little harder 

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:46.330
 garden but as it has been so very 

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:49.400
 spontaneous because it's already that way and 

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:53.840
 well here you can see the whole house with 

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:57.390
 with the roof and the garden and everything and nothing 

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:59.310
 Well, if you liked to like 

00:06:57.390 --> 00:07:01.500

 Simple easy and beautiful then nothing
