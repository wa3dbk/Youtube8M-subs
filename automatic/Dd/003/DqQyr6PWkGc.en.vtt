00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:06.830 
couldn't really ever get immersed to

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:08.320 
couldn't really ever get immersed to
that<00:03:06.980> and<00:03:07.190> I<00:03:07.280> have<00:03:07.460> a<00:03:07.490> feeling<00:03:07.970> that<00:03:08.090> when<00:03:08.240> I'm

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:08.330 
that and I have a feeling that when I'm

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:10.180 
that and I have a feeling that when I'm
watching<00:03:08.510> this<00:03:08.780> new<00:03:08.960> version<00:03:09.320> of<00:03:09.380> Batman<00:03:09.590> I'm

watching this new version of Batman I'm
gonna<00:03:10.400> get<00:03:10.550> the<00:03:10.670> sense<00:03:10.940> that<00:03:11.000> Ben<00:03:11.240> Affleck<00:03:11.570> is

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
gonna get the sense that Ben Affleck is

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:13.450 
gonna get the sense that Ben Affleck is
just<00:03:12.050> behind<00:03:12.290> that<00:03:12.410> Batman<00:03:12.920> mask<00:03:13.100> you<00:03:13.370> know

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:15.080 
I'm not gonna get completely immersed to

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:16.600 
I'm not gonna get completely immersed to
the<00:03:15.170> fact<00:03:15.380> that<00:03:15.560> Batman's<00:03:16.160> on<00:03:16.280> the<00:03:16.370> screen

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:16.610 
the fact that Batman's on the screen

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:18.250 
the fact that Batman's on the screen
kicking<00:03:16.970> ass<00:03:17.090> or<00:03:17.270> hey<00:03:17.480> that's<00:03:17.690> Bruce<00:03:18.020> Wayne

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
kicking ass or hey that's Bruce Wayne

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:19.690

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700 
and when it comes to movies I'm pretty

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:21.400 
and when it comes to movies I'm pretty
open-minded<00:03:20.000> okay<00:03:20.570> let's<00:03:20.810> just<00:03:20.990> assume<00:03:21.260> for

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:21.410 
open-minded okay let's just assume for

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:23.380 
open-minded okay let's just assume for
the<00:03:21.500> fact<00:03:21.740> Ben<00:03:22.220> Affleck<00:03:22.580> looks<00:03:22.820> great<00:03:23.210> in<00:03:23.360> that

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:23.390 
the fact Ben Affleck looks great in that

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:25.180 
the fact Ben Affleck looks great in that
Batman<00:03:23.870> so<00:03:24.080> he's<00:03:24.260> pulling<00:03:24.500> off<00:03:24.710> the<00:03:24.890> character

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190 
Batman so he's pulling off the character

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:31.070 
hanging out with Superman or they're

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:32.950 
hanging out with Superman or they're
either<00:03:31.100> fighting<00:03:31.700> each<00:03:31.820> other<00:03:32.060> however<00:03:32.420> they

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:35.270 
play out Man of Steel but let's just

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:37.120 
play out Man of Steel but let's just

okay<00:03:37.670> I<00:03:37.700> think<00:03:37.880> that's<00:03:38.180> where<00:03:38.540> it<00:03:38.690> fails<00:03:39.050> for

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:39.230 
okay I think that's where it fails for

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:41.230 
okay I think that's where it fails for
me<00:03:39.560> in<00:03:39.800> my<00:03:40.040> mind<00:03:40.310> I<00:03:40.640> just<00:03:40.910> get<00:03:41.030> this<00:03:41.120> little
