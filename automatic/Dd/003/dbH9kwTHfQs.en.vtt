00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:39.559
 my name is pedro soto I am 22 years old 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:42.400
 175 and I'm a junior competitor since 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:42.400
 2014 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:50.140
 do not 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:04.739
 I started this sport practicing 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.540
 martial arts at the beginning and I started it 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.000
 to reconcile a little bit with the 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:12.170
 lifting weights and in the end I 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.170
 end up opting for this sport 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:24.430
 and training routine varies 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:26.740
 depending on the time but it's never the same 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:30.549
 we always try to vary the 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:34.259
 repetitions the exercises and what is 

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:37.360
 the execution time to be able 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:39.720
 stimulate maximum fiber and never is 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.720
 So expensive 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:08.960
 during the training I supplement with 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:12.050
 rapidly absorbed carbohydrates and 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:15.770
 ceas and vitamin my three exercises 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:21.350
 favorites would be maybe the flat bench 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:23.240
 with bar press and rowing machine 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:27.320
 only the exercises with which I 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:30.100
 I feel more comfortable and I consider that I have 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:30.100
 more stimulation 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:34.980
 I do not 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:49.770
 currently my diet is quite low in 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:49.770
 carbohydrates due to competition 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:25.760
 and he made six meals a day and 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:29.180
 currently my biggest source is the 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:30.410
 white fish, brown rice and 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:32.570
 vegetable 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:34.970
 my advice to someone who wants to start 

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:38.030
 in this sport it would be that you do not hurry 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:41.780
 do not run do not want to learn to run 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:44.830
 before walking and especially that is 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:44.830
 Very disciplined 

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:50.670
 the indicted 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:02.520
 the best advice they could give me 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:04.590
 has been to follow my dreams 

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:06.240
 chase it in your dreams always when 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:08.450
 I started training like all the 

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:11.360
 world made my mistakes 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:13.519
 for example the bad executions of the 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:17.510
 exercises wanting to lift more weight 

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:19.870
 thinking that more is better and that's what 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:19.870
 always happens 

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:29.879
 my motivation is comes from when I was a 

00:04:25.469 --> 00:04:32.909
 child to me had always caused me a 

00:04:29.879 --> 00:04:34.979
 great impression a person with a physical 

00:04:32.909 --> 00:04:38.310
 out of the ordinary he had called me 

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:41.610
 a lot of attention and I would like it 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:44.669
 approaching the maximum to that I decided that 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:46.800
 I wanted to be a competitor since I 

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:49.889
 I started this sport because I was passionate 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:53.900
 and it was not until I met my 

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:58.110
 preparador jorge martÃ­nez that we started 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:59.569
 this project I consider that my 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:02.039
 greatest achievement to date 

00:04:59.569 --> 00:05:05.819
 sportingly speaking would be to have 

00:05:02.039 --> 00:05:09.080
 managed to gain 10 kilos in since 2014 

00:05:05.819 --> 00:05:09.080
 until 2015 

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:54.240
 Y 

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:01.670
 do not
