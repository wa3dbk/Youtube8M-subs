my mixer so I am going to show how to
bypass<00:01:39.869> this<00:01:40.259> it's<00:01:40.979> so<00:01:41.189> simple

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.190 

first<00:01:45.990> disconnect<00:01:46.770> these<00:01:46.890> wires<00:01:48.049> they<00:01:49.049> are

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
first disconnect these wires they are

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.929 
first disconnect these wires they are
just<00:01:49.439> attached<00:01:50.159> to<00:01:50.369> this<00:01:50.460> you<00:01:50.579> can<00:01:50.729> just

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
just attached to this you can just

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.420 
just attached to this you can just
detach<00:01:51.270> they<00:01:51.720> are<00:01:51.780> not<00:01:52.009> welded<00:01:53.009> or<00:01:53.220> soldered

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
detach they are not welded or soldered

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.539 
detach they are not welded or soldered
or<00:01:53.729> anything<00:01:54.799> so<00:01:55.799> then<00:01:55.950> carefully<00:01:56.369> remove

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
or anything so then carefully remove

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.340 
or anything so then carefully remove
this<00:01:56.880> circuit<00:01:57.240> breaker<00:01:57.509> or<00:01:57.659> you<00:01:57.899> can<00:01:58.049> leave<00:01:58.229> it

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
this circuit breaker or you can leave it

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.319 
this circuit breaker or you can leave it
as<00:01:58.500> it<00:01:58.680> is<00:01:58.770> in<00:01:59.520> case<00:01:59.850> you<00:02:00.000> are<00:02:00.090> going<00:02:00.180> to

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
as it is in case you are going to

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.359 
as it is in case you are going to
replace<00:02:00.540> this<00:02:00.810> you<00:02:01.259> have<00:02:01.469> to<00:02:01.590> remove<00:02:01.860> this<00:02:02.040> if

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
replace this you have to remove this if

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:03.560 
replace this you have to remove this if
you<00:02:02.520> are<00:02:02.579> going<00:02:02.759> to<00:02:02.850> get<00:02:02.939> a<00:02:03.000> new<00:02:03.240> circuit

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
you are going to get a new circuit

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.800 
you are going to get a new circuit
breaker<00:02:04.460> remove<00:02:05.460> this<00:02:05.610> and<00:02:06.030> then<00:02:06.360> replace<00:02:06.719> it

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
breaker remove this and then replace it

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.680 
breaker remove this and then replace it
with<00:02:06.899> anyone<00:02:07.229> but<00:02:07.950> I<00:02:08.129> I<00:02:08.489> know<00:02:08.610> this<00:02:08.970> my<00:02:09.270> circuit

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
with anyone but I I know this my circuit

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.630 
with anyone but I I know this my circuit
breaker<00:02:09.869> is<00:02:10.200> faulty<00:02:10.709> and<00:02:11.129> I'm<00:02:11.280> just<00:02:11.459> going<00:02:11.610> to

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
breaker is faulty and I'm just going to

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.309 
breaker is faulty and I'm just going to
keep<00:02:11.760> it<00:02:11.910> as<00:02:12.030> it<00:02:12.180> is<00:02:12.300> until<00:02:12.750> I<00:02:12.840> get<00:02:13.020> a<00:02:13.050> new

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
keep it as it is until I get a new

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:14.429 
keep it as it is until I get a new
replaced

00:02:14.429 --> 00:02:14.439 
replaced

00:02:14.439 --> 00:02:17.199 
replaced
so<00:02:15.439> as<00:02:15.590> a<00:02:15.620> temporary<00:02:15.950> solution<00:02:16.249> I<00:02:16.670> am<00:02:16.790> going<00:02:17.120> to

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:17.209 
so as a temporary solution I am going to

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:20.949 
so as a temporary solution I am going to
bypass<00:02:17.540> this<00:02:17.870> circuit<00:02:18.109> so<00:02:19.719> after<00:02:20.719> removing

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:20.959 
bypass this circuit so after removing

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:22.899 
bypass this circuit so after removing
these<00:02:21.200> two<00:02:21.469> wires<00:02:21.620> so<00:02:22.280> these<00:02:22.459> are<00:02:22.670> the<00:02:22.760> two

00:02:22.899 --> 00:02:22.909 
these two wires so these are the two

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:24.369 
these two wires so these are the two
wires<00:02:23.180> which<00:02:23.540> are<00:02:23.719> controlled<00:02:24.139> by<00:02:24.230> the

00:02:24.369 --> 00:02:24.379 
wires which are controlled by the

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:27.309 
wires which are controlled by the
circuit<00:02:25.219> breaker<00:02:25.519> so<00:02:26.239> all<00:02:26.569> what<00:02:26.959> we<00:02:27.109> need<00:02:27.260> to

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:27.319 
circuit breaker so all what we need to

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:31.660 
circuit breaker so all what we need to
do<00:02:27.439> is<00:02:27.590> just<00:02:28.370> remove<00:02:28.849> this<00:02:29.290> outer<00:02:30.370> outer<00:02:31.370> layer

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 
do is just remove this outer outer layer

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:34.360 
do is just remove this outer outer layer
also<00:02:32.060> so<00:02:32.420> that<00:02:32.450> these<00:02:33.170> you<00:02:33.500> see<00:02:33.920> these<00:02:34.159> two

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
also so that these you see these two

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:40.659 
also so that these you see these two
metal<00:02:34.639> strips<00:02:35.120> so<00:02:36.099> just<00:02:37.099> get<00:02:37.250> a<00:02:37.280> maybe<00:02:39.669> tape

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:40.669 
metal strips so just get a maybe tape

00:02:40.669 --> 00:02:42.789 
metal strips so just get a maybe tape
and<00:02:41.030> insulation<00:02:41.389> tape<00:02:41.659> or<00:02:41.959> a<00:02:42.019> surgical<00:02:42.500> tape

00:02:42.789 --> 00:02:42.799 
and insulation tape or a surgical tape

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:47.349 
and insulation tape or a surgical tape
like<00:02:43.669> this<00:02:43.700> one<00:02:45.040> just<00:02:46.040> disconnect<00:02:46.519> this<00:02:47.090> and

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:47.359 
like this one just disconnect this and

00:02:47.359 --> 00:02:53.020 
like this one just disconnect this and
this<00:02:47.840> and<00:02:50.260> ensure<00:02:51.260> that<00:02:51.469> these<00:02:52.310> two<00:02:52.730> metal

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
this and ensure that these two metal

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:55.270 
this and ensure that these two metal
strips<00:02:53.299> touch<00:02:53.540> each<00:02:53.719> other<00:02:53.900> and<00:02:54.079> then<00:02:55.069> put<00:02:55.250> a

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
strips touch each other and then put a

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.599 
strips touch each other and then put a
surgical<00:02:55.699> tape<00:02:55.879> on<00:02:56.090> it<00:02:56.239> just<00:02:56.750> keep<00:02:56.930> it<00:02:57.049> in<00:02:57.199> and

00:02:57.599 --> 00:02:57.609 
surgical tape on it just keep it in and

00:02:57.609 --> 00:03:01.149 
surgical tape on it just keep it in and
just<00:02:58.609> close<00:02:59.269> the<00:02:59.510> bottom<00:02:59.930> lid<00:03:00.109> that's<00:03:00.799> all<00:03:00.980> we

00:03:01.149 --> 00:03:01.159 
just close the bottom lid that's all we

00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:02.740 
just close the bottom lid that's all we
are<00:03:01.250> done<00:03:01.370> with<00:03:01.549> this<00:03:01.669> and<00:03:01.879> then<00:03:02.299> this<00:03:02.480> motor

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
are done with this and then this motor

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:05.280 
are done with this and then this motor
will<00:03:02.900> this<00:03:03.319> mixer<00:03:03.769> will<00:03:03.919> start<00:03:04.219> working<00:03:04.430> but

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290 
will this mixer will start working but

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:07.780 
will this mixer will start working but
without<00:03:06.290> a<00:03:06.349> circuit<00:03:06.709> breaker<00:03:06.799> ensure<00:03:07.519> that

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790 
without a circuit breaker ensure that

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:10.509 
without a circuit breaker ensure that
you<00:03:08.090> do<00:03:08.239> not<00:03:08.419> overload<00:03:08.989> the<00:03:09.230> machine<00:03:09.519> thank

00:03:10.509 --> 00:03:10.519 
you do not overload the machine thank

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:13.599 
you do not overload the machine thank
you<00:03:10.639> thanks<00:03:11.030> for<00:03:11.060> watching<00:03:11.389> my<00:03:11.510> video
