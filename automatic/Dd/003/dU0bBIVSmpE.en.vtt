00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 hall youtube and welcome to one 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:06.870
 short technique slutty video again 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.340
 with the new model or engine 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.580
 third generation 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.110
 this time the front camera is on it 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.990
 yes we improve now we have one 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:18.300
 5 megapixel sensor also installed full 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.980
 hd can record videos and what I 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.020
 right here on tour and if I have 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.240
 over to the smartphone display chile 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.650
 then it looks really good 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.840
 Well, I'm sitting here, of course 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.550
 again under ideal light conditions 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.920
 the big window again a few 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.230
 lamps so the lighting is great 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.579
 and also what the audio recording quality 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.230
 This should be all right again 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.230
 be reasonable when i sit in mine 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.989
 major ten meters maximum of 20 meters 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.450
 get away from memory when you do with it 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.800
 skype or video chat or something like that 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.149
 you keep the device actually in the 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.530
 usually a bit closer 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.199
 then there should still be at the 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.670
 audio quality euros what his rauszuholen 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.250
 this is the way, of course, the 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.050
 second generation motorola moto gp 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.390
 Of course there will be enough 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.500
 compare videos and the devices 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.719
 to feel on the tooth 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.129
 I got used to it slowly 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.170
 here a little bit longer the video 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.790
 just that one speaker 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.650
 is installed at the third g 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.270
 generation which I find very bad what 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.630
 I also can not understand how 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.310
 before the price and how much better the 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.200
 video quality has become or the 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.090
 Of course , you still want a photo quality 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.830
 compare but I always give it 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.530
 open again and honest to that 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:28.140
 motoki has behind me the factor 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.570
 the price performance champions and da tu 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:34.140
 I have to agree with the price of from yes 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.310
 say 230 euros extremely hard 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.079
 and now we can do a bit more 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:42.030
 Movements here in the videos are like that 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:42.869
 once ran away again and again and 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.000
 ran 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:51.630
 yes the darkened seems good too 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:53.579
 work only with movement was that 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.990
 actually fits on this little one 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:57.509
 smartphone display comes that here 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.369
 being really extremely good 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.049
 I also have to say mine in the video 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.579
 Test from the back of the camera 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.079
 this looks really well smartphones 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:06.899
 reasonable from there one thinks oneself where 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:08.489
 super video quality as soon as I get that 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.530
 video then but on the big monitor 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:12.239
 angucke 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:14.940
 It does not look that way anymore 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:16.319
 that's why chris paus still as small 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.269
 Tip on the edge not only such a video 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:19.980
 then on the small display look the 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:21.060
 Of course, then it also falsifies 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.010
 even a bigger monitor 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.379
 If you look at these the videos 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.360
 otherwise, one looks afterwards 

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:30.000
 but a little disappointed if you then the 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.660
 pictures sometimes in big looks good that 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.040
 but it should have been 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.720
 Of course we mainly with one 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.220
 small smartphone monitor plays around 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.319
 is that no matter enough then something 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.950
 small but that's it now 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:39.510
 his 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:43.970
 Thanks for watching it makes it good 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.970
 and bye video bye
