00:00:02.709 --> 00:00:05.709
 d 

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:12.730
 26 

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:12.730
 likewise the good life 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:22.869
 there's a boy 

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:35.760
 do not 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:41.510
 ah 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:51.890
 ah 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:00.410
 ah 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:13.150
 hello everyone how are only seven 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:14.800
 kingdoms I bring a new video and I 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:18.370
 I bring the simulation of combat between 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:20.110
 100 punk champion vdw against rail 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:22.270
 goes for the double double vou title 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:23.740
 it is clear and good this fight has been 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:27.220
 confirmed a week ago if I did not 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:29.650
 wrong and good the expectation of 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:31.990
 fight as everyone believes I think that 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:34.270
 everyone knows that he will win that 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:37.480
 combat always because the expectation 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:41.080
 let's go everybody wants to see well they are 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:43.870
 fighting against the rock on wheels bmr 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:47.230
 or what of what we want 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:49.760
 we want to see the other field at 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:52.640
 another champion in quotes 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:54.380
 to the other side of the brand and at the expense of 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.650
 rock like I did in china ago 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:59.720
 almost a year against rock control in 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:01.610
 Armenian wheels as you know with 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:03.680
 victory for defeat and there are many 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:05.540
 chances that the rock wins that 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.880
 combat wheel rumble who wins the 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:10.580
 title of the vdw remove the title without 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:13.400
 pack and lose it the average salt against the 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:15.410
 same against 100 punk the truth 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.480
 is that it would be pretty good but 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:19.400
 it's also rumored like that in bread 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.410
 against undertaker or if in bread against 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.360
 stone cold steve austin in does not end 29 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:26.180
 The truth is that no one knows what is going 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:28.670
 to spend in the months that we have left for 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.320
 ahead because it comes from him yes now 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:33.860
 same that will face up as if 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:36.800
 found in leyva bread that started as 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:38.420
 a monster from the company's and to the 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.860
 final finished against someone who stops 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:41.870
 because skin to make you lose 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:44.180
 they have to be Shia this rise to 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:45.700
 real pig as you say right now 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:48.459
 I do not get forgive 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:50.440
 they have to do scams like 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:53.470
 you have seen in the first fight 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:56.140
 brad magicians that has already disappeared 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:58.540
 comes out in the second bout for the title 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:00.760
 of heaven like this from nothing like that because 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:02.620
 but I think that saying yes it's going to 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.110
 have importance 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:08.019
 and now in a third that's the one time 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:10.330
 more is to imply every setback in 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:14.440
 a table slider sanchez plus a tlc more 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:16.959
 the truth is with stairs and chairs and 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:20.500
 tables and as you know you have to upload the 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:22.540
 staircase is that we have to go up and 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:25.120
 lower the belt 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:28.599
 well no I do not imagine up going up to 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:30.610
 the ladder and lowering the title I see 

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:32.560
 more like that in bread as you already know and as 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:32.950
 I was saying nobody knows what's going to 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.379
 happen 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:38.349
 during these months on skin if they are going to 

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:40.480
 face these two in round the champion 

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:43.690
 the winner of that fight against rock 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:46.269
 that surely after you from you the 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:49.510
 yes from that combat appear 

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:51.970
 start appearing and raw rock 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:53.480
 smackdown I do not think but it will not go back to 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:55.550
 Appear 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:59.000
 and from there the road to 

00:03:55.550 --> 00:04:01.250
 wrestlemania and then at the weddings of 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.610
 silver we will see who is the one who wins the 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:07.010
 royal rumble let's hope they are 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:09.200
 saying that he will win once again one 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:11.390
 of the blue mark and will challenge the champion 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:12.830
 of the heavyweight and do not want to because 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:17.120
 they want to interfere in the fight for the 

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:20.630
 title of the vdw and very possibly be 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:23.479
 the maine sell or semenya before as 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:25.070
 you know the winner the rumble winner was 

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:27.440
 the main event of russell media but it 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:29.449
 changed and the winner of oaky rumble 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:31.880
 has his title opportunity as the 

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:33.650
 last year was the first fight the 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:37.039
 after prison for repression or almost 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:39.680
 does not count and well let's hope it wins 

00:04:37.039 --> 00:04:40.910
 who click even if who wants the uat w 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:43.910
 because you know what is it they decide 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:45.440
 we bet on punk although I 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:47.060
 I would like it to win top but good 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:48.919
 we bet on the part I hope it is 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:49.760
 liked the life life favorites will be 

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:52.240
 next friends 

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:52.240
 goodbye
