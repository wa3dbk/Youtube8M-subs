00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:07.170
 we are again at lake like george 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.019
 in the north of new york state and now 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:12.660
 the camera shows a beautiful panorama 

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:18.390
 cloudy day but visible lake visible hills 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:20.640
 I myself will go to these places when recently with 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.359
 historical point of view lived the Indians 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:26.070
 this is one of the centers of the north 

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:28.560
 of indian civilization here in these mountains in 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:32.399
 these harsh on very beautiful places with 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:36.390
 Windows lakes something like Russia 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:38.700
 On our Siberia lived Indians and the shaft of communication 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.629
 with this very often talking to 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:44.280
 by americans 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:47.879
 I heard that once the ancestors of modern 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.579
 white Americans they came here 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:53.640
 destroyed Indian civilization 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:56.610
 built their own state here but then 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.469
 bakhyt but punished and now america on 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.140
 eyes populated by put already 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.609
 other non-Christian nations here are very 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.430
 a lot of chinese a lot of hindus 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:08.640
 Arabs America gradually turns into 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.619
 so very civilized outwardly very 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.170
 financially well off but still 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:15.450
 babylon walking down central street 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.759
 new york can hear chinese speech 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.920
 indian arabic russian speech can 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.689
 hear anyway passing kilometer 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.270
 in New York, you can always questions 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:26.729
 Russian speech and good or bad 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.070
 let everyone decide she comes to me 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.780
 head completely different thoughts for some reason 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:35.970
 I think about this beautiful story 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:37.229
 lands that I now turned out to me 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.119
 another thing comes to mind 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.009
 comparison yes here were Indians 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.810
 they had their own culture and Indians 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.670
 probably were different but still we 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.310
 We know that mostly Indians were 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.710
 pagans many had human 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.550
 sacrifices and from the Christian point 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.620
 of view 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:55.920
 many of them were satanists they 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:58.200
 worshiped the devil iv north america and 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.630
 in south america and when did they come here 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.780
 Christians because they were Indians 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.670
 baptize and those Indians who were baptized 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:09.600
 and removed them from the Christians no one 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:11.570
 destroyed they lived and saved could 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:14.700
 compare your culture your civilization 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:16.380
 but some Indians resisted and they 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.510
 resisted not only because 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:22.910
 strangers came to their land not 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.910
 defended their faith they send us 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:31.740
 my delusions and it seems to me that 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:34.310
 be the situation was that 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:38.070
 then god helped the christians 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:41.220
 good real Christians in the fight 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:42.150
 against pagans against evil which 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.030
 carried in delirium 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:47.310
 and then these Christians are descendants of these 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.960
 Christians how could we not be related to 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.850
 the creation of the united states but 

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:53.490
 the founders of the United States were believers 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:55.590
 yes many of them were wrong they were 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:56.550
 different confessions some were sent 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:58.620
 but many 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:00.300
 I will not name them now and not 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:02.880
 specialist american history but 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:03.810
 many wrote that a person should do 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:07.470
 laws 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:08.940
 only based on the laws of god the founders 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:11.550
 American state in particular 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:13.500
 jefferson wrote that if some 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:15.660
 the ruler makes laws that 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.970
 contradict the law of god people should not 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:20.070
 to obey him that is they believed that 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:21.870
 every Christian person should himself 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:24.600
 determine what is good what is bad 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:27.840
 so that the will of God is against the will of his 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:29.790
 gradually the descendants of these Christians 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:33.569
 became atheists 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:36.540
 became tolerant stopped believing in 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:41.159
 God began to live as primitive Dikari 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:43.230
 and now god punish them he gives it 

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:46.140
 they gave this land as a gift to the richest 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:48.420
 there were a lot of beautiful Russian people here 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:50.010
 19th century sit about it and there are cities here 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:53.090
 Moscow, Saint Petersburg 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:57.959
 here you can see the name of the Cossack villages by you 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:59.639
 can be interesting and Russian pupyr and but in 

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:01.560
 whole as an American civilization 

00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:03.480
 began to abandon its foundations from 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:06.000
 Christianity and now god punishes 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:08.609
 now non-christians are coming anti 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.560
 Christians and rule this world is not 

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:13.340
 Christians when we hear about what 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:15.209
 President Obama has spoken in support 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:17.060
 homosexual marriages of this being built 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:20.549
 arrived 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:23.250
 I came here a lot that I heard from Putin 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:24.360
 until he spoke for it 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:26.520
 be one of the few positive 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:29.099
 comparisons that I can do 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:30.840
 to Putin so that he would not support him 

00:04:29.099 --> 00:04:34.349
 was a sexy married god forbid and not 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:36.750
 supported and that's because 

00:04:34.349 --> 00:04:39.419
 granite base once a person leaves 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:40.530
 from a deep Christian position 

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:42.500
 morality it ceases to be 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:45.659
 man turns into such 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:48.500
 cultural live and I would really like 

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:51.060
 so that the problem of america is solved by 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:55.620
 the return of its indigenous population 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:56.770
 christian seems to me then everything will be 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:58.599
 OK 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:01.810
 the same can be said about my country 

00:04:58.599 --> 00:05:03.669
 and Russia only if we are Russian folk 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:06.490
 other indigenous people will be back in 

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:08.319
 Christianity some nations to Islam 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:11.349
 maybe if they consider themselves 

00:05:08.319 --> 00:05:14.400
 Muslims are Tatars but most 

00:05:11.349 --> 00:05:17.080
 our people and Russian Christians and 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:20.710
 decanters you are christians we must return 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:24.419
 to Christianity then probably almost everything 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:24.419
 problems of our country russia
