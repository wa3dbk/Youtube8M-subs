touch<00:04:01.410> sliding<00:04:02.040> controls<00:04:02.900> so<00:04:03.900> part<00:04:04.140> of<00:04:04.170> the

touch sliding controls so part of the
reason<00:04:04.470> why<00:04:05.130> I<00:04:05.160> dislike<00:04:05.519> these<00:04:05.940> is<00:04:06.150> because<00:04:06.450> my

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:06.600 
reason why I dislike these is because my

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:08.240 
reason why I dislike these is because my
device<00:04:06.959> had<00:04:07.440> a<00:04:07.470> little<00:04:07.650> bit<00:04:07.769> of<00:04:07.829> a<00:04:07.890> hard<00:04:08.040> time

device had a little bit of a hard time
with<00:04:08.430> this<00:04:08.519> game<00:04:08.700> and<00:04:09.410> one<00:04:10.410> of<00:04:10.500> the<00:04:10.560> awesome

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:10.950 
with this game and one of the awesome

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:12.350 
with this game and one of the awesome
things<00:04:10.980> that<00:04:11.220> happened<00:04:11.700> is<00:04:11.820> as<00:04:12.030> you're

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:12.360 
things that happened is as you're

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.720 
things that happened is as you're
steering<00:04:12.780> if<00:04:12.930> the<00:04:13.110> game<00:04:13.290> jitters<00:04:13.739> in<00:04:13.980> any<00:04:14.519> way

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:14.730 
steering if the game jitters in any way

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:15.440 
steering if the game jitters in any way
whatsoever

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:15.450 
whatsoever

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:17.150 
whatsoever
it<00:04:15.660> decides<00:04:16.109> that<00:04:16.260> it's<00:04:16.590> not<00:04:16.859> going<00:04:17.070> to

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 
it decides that it's not going to

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.340 
it decides that it's not going to
recognize<00:04:17.579> your<00:04:17.760> touch<00:04:18.000> any<00:04:18.239> longer<00:04:18.539> so<00:04:19.229> you

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:19.350 
recognize your touch any longer so you

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:20.060 
recognize your touch any longer so you
run<00:04:19.440> into<00:04:19.590> the<00:04:19.680> wall

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
run into the wall

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:22.850 
run into the wall
and<00:04:20.250> what's<00:04:20.519> finally<00:04:20.940> left<00:04:21.239> is<00:04:21.510> an<00:04:22.140> exercise

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 
and what's finally left is an exercise

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:26.029 
and what's finally left is an exercise
and<00:04:23.370> frustration<00:04:24.300> so<00:04:25.260> fortunately<00:04:25.770> for<00:04:25.890> me<00:04:26.010> I

00:04:26.029 --> 00:04:26.039 
and frustration so fortunately for me I

00:04:26.039 --> 00:04:28.340 
and frustration so fortunately for me I
swap<00:04:26.669> the<00:04:26.789> controls<00:04:27.120> back<00:04:27.330> went<00:04:27.660> back<00:04:27.930> to<00:04:28.229> the

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:28.350 
swap the controls back went back to the

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:30.650 
swap the controls back went back to the
tilt<00:04:28.560> screen<00:04:28.770> but<00:04:29.190> it<00:04:29.280> wasn't<00:04:29.700> after<00:04:30.000> I<00:04:30.570> had

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:30.660 
tilt screen but it wasn't after I had

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:32.659 
tilt screen but it wasn't after I had
already<00:04:30.780> done<00:04:31.020> too<00:04:31.169> much<00:04:31.320> damage<00:04:31.380> and<00:04:31.979> I

00:04:32.659 --> 00:04:32.669 
already done too much damage and I

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:37.700 
already done too much damage and I
wrecked<00:04:33.450> myself<00:04:34.430> but<00:04:35.430> my<00:04:35.550> car<00:04:35.789> can<00:04:36.060> fly<00:04:36.710> so

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:37.710 
wrecked myself but my car can fly so

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:39.469 
wrecked myself but my car can fly so
overall<00:04:38.010> my<00:04:38.160> experience<00:04:38.340> with<00:04:38.850> this<00:04:38.940> game<00:04:39.030> was

00:04:39.469 --> 00:04:39.479 
overall my experience with this game was

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:41.659 
overall my experience with this game was
it's<00:04:39.810> pretty<00:04:40.140> average<00:04:40.380> for<00:04:40.890> a<00:04:40.919> driver<00:04:41.280> for

00:04:41.659 --> 00:04:41.669 
it's pretty average for a driver for

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:42.980 
it's pretty average for a driver for
seven<00:04:41.970> dollars<00:04:42.060> I<00:04:42.330> think<00:04:42.360> you<00:04:42.600> could<00:04:42.750> probably

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:42.990 
seven dollars I think you could probably

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:44.390 
seven dollars I think you could probably
buy<00:04:43.440> a<00:04:43.470> better

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:44.400 
buy a better

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.370 
buy a better
than<00:04:44.580> this<00:04:44.699> one<00:04:44.940> so<00:04:44.970> this<00:04:45.419> moment<00:04:45.630> I<00:04:45.930> would<00:04:46.110> not

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:46.380 
than this one so this moment I would not

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:47.689 
than this one so this moment I would not
recommend<00:04:46.680> this<00:04:47.040> game

00:04:47.689 --> 00:04:47.699 
recommend this game

00:04:47.699 --> 00:04:49.219 
recommend this game
there's<00:04:47.850> too<00:04:48.000> many<00:04:48.090> performance<00:04:48.810> issues<00:04:49.199> and

00:04:49.219 --> 00:04:49.229 
there's too many performance issues and

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:51.020 
there's too many performance issues and
there's<00:04:49.620> not<00:04:49.830> enough<00:04:50.100> that<00:04:50.280> really<00:04:50.610> sets<00:04:50.880> this

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:51.030 
there's not enough that really sets this

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:53.300 
there's not enough that really sets this
game<00:04:51.150> apart<00:04:51.300> from<00:04:51.780> other<00:04:51.990> racers<00:04:52.470> but<00:04:53.070> it<00:04:53.190> is

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:53.310 
game apart from other racers but it is

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:54.740 
game apart from other racers but it is
pretty<00:04:53.490> decent<00:04:53.729> game<00:04:54.030> so<00:04:54.300> if<00:04:54.360> you're<00:04:54.479> in<00:04:54.600> the

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:54.750 
pretty decent game so if you're in the

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:57.320 
pretty decent game so if you're in the
racers<00:04:55.340> maybe<00:04:56.340> but<00:04:56.880> if<00:04:56.940> you're<00:04:57.060> not<00:04:57.150> into

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:57.330 
racers maybe but if you're not into

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:59.450 
racers maybe but if you're not into
