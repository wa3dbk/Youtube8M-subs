00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
off by the color that we're going to be

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.760 
off by the color that we're going to be
producing<00:00:44.100> of<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.360> drink<00:00:45.600> because<00:00:46.170> it

producing of the drink because it

actually<00:00:47.280> is<00:00:47.520> quite<00:00:47.730> tasty<00:00:48.120> and<00:00:48.359> and<00:00:48.510> it<00:00:48.870> might

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
actually is quite tasty and and it might

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.569 
actually is quite tasty and and it might
be<00:00:49.079> for<00:00:49.440> some<00:00:49.559> people<00:00:49.800> maybe<00:00:49.829> it's<00:00:50.219> a<00:00:50.309> bit<00:00:50.430> of

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
be for some people maybe it's a bit of

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.279 
be for some people maybe it's a bit of
an<00:00:50.730> earthy<00:00:51.180> taste<00:00:51.359> it's<00:00:51.629> a<00:00:51.690> little<00:00:51.930> acquired

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
an earthy taste it's a little acquired

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.380 
an earthy taste it's a little acquired
but<00:00:52.680> it's<00:00:53.280> actually<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.789> juice<00:00:53.969> makes<00:00:54.239> it

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
but it's actually the juice makes it

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.959 
but it's actually the juice makes it
taste<00:00:54.600> really<00:00:54.660> nice<00:00:54.960> and<00:00:55.140> sweet<00:00:55.350> and<00:00:55.969> it's

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
taste really nice and sweet and it's

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.459 
taste really nice and sweet and it's
probably<00:00:57.180> cheaper<00:00:57.329> than<00:00:57.719> going<00:00:58.050> out<00:00:58.230> and

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
probably cheaper than going out and

00:00:58.469 --> 00:00:59.990 
probably cheaper than going out and
buying<00:00:58.620> expensive<00:00:58.980> drinks<00:00:59.309> and<00:00:59.460> actually<00:00:59.910> you

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
buying expensive drinks and actually you

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.290 
buying expensive drinks and actually you
can<00:01:00.180> make<00:01:00.359> it<00:01:00.539> more<00:01:01.530> high-quality<00:01:02.210> doing<00:01:03.210> it

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
can make it more high-quality doing it

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.419 
can make it more high-quality doing it

of<00:01:48.179> the<00:01:48.420> glass<00:01:49.080> jar<00:01:49.470> this<00:01:49.979> jar<00:01:50.280> for<00:01:50.459> the<00:01:50.580> record

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:50.910 
of the glass jar this jar for the record

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:53.510 
of the glass jar this jar for the record
is<00:01:51.030> probably<00:01:51.360> like<00:01:51.709> 300<00:01:52.709> milliliters<00:01:53.160> or<00:01:53.190> so

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
is probably like 300 milliliters or so

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.229 
is probably like 300 milliliters or so
it's<00:01:53.700> just<00:01:53.849> over<00:01:54.330> a<00:01:54.539> cup<00:01:55.369> by<00:01:56.369> a<00:01:56.399> bit<00:01:56.640> so<00:01:57.149> we'll

00:01:57.229 --> 00:01:57.239 
it's just over a cup by a bit so we'll

00:01:57.239 --> 00:01:59.210 
it's just over a cup by a bit so we'll
just<00:01:57.270> use<00:01:57.569> some<00:01:57.780> blueberry<00:01:58.379> juice<00:01:58.649> and<00:01:58.950> then

00:01:59.210 --> 00:01:59.220 
just use some blueberry juice and then

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.729 
just use some blueberry juice and then
the<00:01:59.520> rest<00:01:59.729> i'm<00:02:00.720> going<00:02:00.840> to<00:02:00.959> use<00:02:01.050> apple<00:02:01.379> juice<00:02:01.560> if

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:01.739 
the rest i'm going to use apple juice if

00:02:01.739 --> 00:02:03.410 
the rest i'm going to use apple juice if
you<00:02:01.830> buy<00:02:01.920> a<00:02:01.950> juice<00:02:02.310> that's<00:02:02.580> like<00:02:02.759> blueberry

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
been sprayed on the apples and this

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.710

so<00:02:24.100> depending<00:02:25.100> on<00:02:25.190> your<00:02:25.280> bio<00:02:25.460> region<00:02:25.820> i<00:02:25.970> live

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
so depending on your bio region i live

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:28.510 
so depending on your bio region i live
in<00:02:26.690> ontario<00:02:26.870> when<00:02:27.290> and<00:02:27.500> there's<00:02:28.010> an<00:02:28.220> abundance

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:28.520 
in ontario when and there's an abundance

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:30.190 
in ontario when and there's an abundance
of<00:02:28.760> apples<00:02:29.120> so<00:02:29.330> i<00:02:29.480> can<00:02:29.660> always<00:02:29.750> find<00:02:29.990> good

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
of apples so i can always find good

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.390 
of apples so i can always find good
organic<00:02:30.440> apple<00:02:30.770> juice<00:02:30.950> around<00:02:31.130> this<00:02:31.190> not

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
organic apple juice around this not

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.940 
organic apple juice around this not
super<00:02:31.640> expensive<00:02:31.930> so<00:02:32.930> that's<00:02:33.140> about<00:02:33.350> half<00:02:33.710> the

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
super expensive so that's about half the

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.760 
super expensive so that's about half the
jar<00:02:34.220> maybe<00:02:35.030> a<00:02:35.120> little<00:02:35.240> bit<00:02:35.600> less<00:02:35.870> but<00:02:35.900> that's

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:36.770 
jar maybe a little bit less but that's

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:38.620 
jar maybe a little bit less but that's
what<00:02:36.950> a<00:02:36.980> good<00:02:37.100> quantity<00:02:37.310> and<00:02:37.640> then<00:02:38.270> we're

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:38.630 
what a good quantity and then we're

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:40.270 
what a good quantity and then we're
going<00:02:38.720> to<00:02:38.810> put<00:02:38.930> in<00:02:39.080> the<00:02:39.260> first<00:02:39.590> green<00:02:40.040> powder

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
going to put in the first green powder

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.940 
going to put in the first green powder
so<00:02:40.670> this<00:02:40.820> is<00:02:40.940> just<00:02:41.180> kind<00:02:41.300> of<00:02:41.390> like<00:02:41.690> a<00:02:41.950> general

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
so this is just kind of like a general

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:45.520 
so this is just kind of like a general
green<00:02:43.910> powder<00:02:44.180> there<00:02:44.720> are<00:02:44.780> lots<00:02:45.050> of<00:02:45.200> different

and stuff like that and i would suggest
avoiding<00:03:01.100> those<00:03:01.430> because<00:03:01.610> it's<00:03:01.700> not<00:03:01.850> really

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
avoiding those because it's not really

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:04.150 
avoiding those because it's not really
worth<00:03:02.270> it<00:03:02.450> this<00:03:02.900> one<00:03:03.110> does<00:03:03.650> feel<00:03:03.890> kind<00:03:03.950> of

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.160 
worth it this one does feel kind of

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:05.560 
worth it this one does feel kind of
steep<00:03:04.430> in<00:03:04.550> price<00:03:04.790> when<00:03:05.000> you<00:03:05.090> buy<00:03:05.270> it<00:03:05.300> all<00:03:05.540> at

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:05.570 
steep in price when you buy it all at

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:08.020 
steep in price when you buy it all at
once<00:03:05.870> but<00:03:06.020> it<00:03:06.710> adds<00:03:06.860> averages<00:03:07.640> out<00:03:07.730> to<00:03:07.820> like<00:03:08.000> a

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
once but it adds averages out to like a

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:10.270 
once but it adds averages out to like a
dollar<00:03:08.360> a<00:03:08.450> dollar<00:03:08.720> fifty<00:03:09.020> per<00:03:09.560> serving<00:03:10.130> and

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.280 
dollar a dollar fifty per serving and

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:11.470 
dollar a dollar fifty per serving and
that's<00:03:10.610> kind<00:03:10.790> of<00:03:10.820> like<00:03:10.940> going<00:03:11.150> out<00:03:11.270> for<00:03:11.420> coffee

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480 
that's kind of like going out for coffee

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.360 
that's kind of like going out for coffee
or<00:03:11.990> maybe<00:03:12.320> even<00:03:12.410> cheaper<00:03:12.860> they<00:03:12.950> went<00:03:13.130> out<00:03:13.160> for

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370 
or maybe even cheaper they went out for

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:15.010 
or maybe even cheaper they went out for
coffee<00:03:13.490> so<00:03:13.880> I<00:03:14.090> don't<00:03:14.480> think<00:03:14.540> it's<00:03:14.720> that<00:03:14.780> bad

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:15.020 
coffee so I don't think it's that bad

something<00:05:10.719> that<00:05:10.810> I<00:05:10.870> talked<00:05:11.080> about<00:05:11.110> in<00:05:11.409> my<00:05:11.500> book

00:05:11.519 --> 00:05:11.529 
something that I talked about in my book

00:05:11.529 --> 00:05:16.200 
something that I talked about in my book
it's<00:05:12.520> kind<00:05:12.669> of<00:05:12.759> the<00:05:13.000> the<00:05:13.419> cheapest<00:05:15.210> filter

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:16.210 
it's kind of the the cheapest filter

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:17.369 
it's kind of the the cheapest filter
that<00:05:16.330> you<00:05:16.419> can<00:05:16.539> get<00:05:16.629> that's<00:05:16.840> good<00:05:16.990> quality

00:05:17.369 --> 00:05:17.379 
that you can get that's good quality

00:05:17.379 --> 00:05:19.170 
that you can get that's good quality
it's<00:05:17.710> better<00:05:17.889> quality<00:05:18.279> than<00:05:18.310> a<00:05:18.460> like<00:05:18.849> a<00:05:18.879> Brita

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:19.180 
it's better quality than a like a Brita

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:21.269

up a jug and then keep it on the counter

00:05:22.719 --> 00:05:25.619

eyeballing and will just screw on the

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:40.140 
eyeballing and will just screw on the
lid<00:05:37.240> make<00:05:37.599> sure<00:05:37.750> it's<00:05:37.900> nice<00:05:38.050> and<00:05:38.110> tight<00:05:39.150> give
