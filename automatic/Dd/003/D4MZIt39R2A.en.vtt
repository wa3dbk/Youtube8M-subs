00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:13.500
 meal quinny at the start and 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.500
 Welcome to a new part of you on 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.580
 skype this time for the first time in mw3 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.430
 the map mission 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:23.310
 and yes I have two servers class 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.920
 prepared because I often 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.510
 annoyed by Barrett types therefore 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.220
 This time I have the already 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.920
 packed but if the first time the 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:35.399
 quite normal yes I say so the 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.980
 locations over the l 11 and let's see 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.950
 how it works here was that 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.790
 Nothing 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:43.950
 I would have it for now purely 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.260
 I grew in the stream yesterday too 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:49.379
 Of course, mp3 plays with normal 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:53.789
 weapons and it was amazing 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:55.739
 very good so good and i am 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.800
 really on the superior of the times again 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:05.909
 to gamble in w3 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:07.740
 the watch again more times look no 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.290
 that may not be true now I want 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:16.710
 it may not be true he 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:21.320
 Will you get me this year? 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:23.090
 down there again marca 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:26.110
 that's why I'm so short of people's cross 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.110
 not something from 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.289
 oh come 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.510
 it's enough for me too and I'm in shape 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:43.900
 on 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:46.260
 I thought I come by there hey look 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:48.700
 you constantly up your pants or you 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:51.600
 the cases are left behind 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:54.490
 and I run or I go insane 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:57.720
 from young now also first drone out 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:57.720
 and then you go right around 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:04.630
 This is just unreal 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:06.280
 I'm just doing it in the back tomorrow 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:09.300
 bad it will not work 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.300
 while the hackers are not 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:16.560
 It's easy with illnesses in the game 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:23.370
 Oh, exceptionally I should not 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:23.370
 clap now or what 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:29.180
 oh my god and down 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:36.500
 I can tell it again a fuck 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:43.530
 I'm still a bit too 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:47.010
 rusted what the savings 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:47.610
 Here's something better for you 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:51.450
 current 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:57.269
 oh my god you are the old running one 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:58.709
 piece of atommÃ¼ll boy yes I would have 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:00.540
 to move sooner or weapon 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:09.380
 then it would have to come out again 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:09.380
 or human children the soups kaspar 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:16.980
 I'm in close combat there 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.980
 just bad 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:21.560
 there but was still far worse 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:26.629
 again lie back old 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:29.590
 also garbage 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:44.350
 if nothing else helps take pistol 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:50.860
 Before I look in this corner we will see 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:53.440
 out of here wittmaack people better me 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:57.760
 I can also say my msr 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:04:02.760
 Mr there is still running or 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:07.410
 but remains could bring are 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:07.410
 you stupid season 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:22.549
 oh my god what am I doing what am I doing 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:22.549
 my god, too, is open to people 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:32.910
 unfortunately, comes constantly from the back and from 

00:04:27.759 --> 00:04:32.910
 young at the same time I raced off 

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:40.110
 I'm sorry people but I sell 

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:47.650
 and again from behind 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:56.050
 they are so bubbly but where do they come from ? 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:57.250
 because you people I have to 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:03.000
 It is not mine 

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:06.190
 controller is in front and misplace 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:09.970
 I piss off and I'm right 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:12.630
 surrounded by his whores are young 

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:12.630
 that's not normal anymore 

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:25.539
 I would like to have the right weapon 

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:27.150
 always take the snowboard katar wonders 

00:05:25.539 --> 00:05:29.620
 he always loses himself 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:32.470
 how can i only make the decision in 

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:38.580
 hittnau it is not anymore 

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:38.580
 normally lost the same 

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:58.240
 that was close there was once the run 

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:58.240
 into the house I have no gun anymore 

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:03.340
 warm room 

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:17.789
 no no no no that 's not true 

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:22.860
 and then there are still young ones 

00:06:17.789 --> 00:06:26.160
 in the back then I can also do something 

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:30.410
 even just gone 

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:33.800
 that was not the top 30 thought 

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:37.230
 are 19 deaths 

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:41.460
 but it worked better than for example 

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:42.990
 in black ops two but while the hip 

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:45.420
 Hopper I would not have been guaranteed 

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:47.610
 in the top 3 so that's for sure 

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:49.920
 Maybe I would not have won that 

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:51.480
 but not with the sniper at least 

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:54.330
 top 3 I would be with me 

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:56.370
 Satisfied yes it did not have to 

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:59.910
 But it was also the first time 

00:06:56.370 --> 00:07:01.200
 mp3 and i thought i actually find it 

00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:04.220
 I have to be really cool again 

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:08.370
 I did not think I had thought 

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:09.870
 Mw3 played when I played the ps3 again 

00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:12.060
 I would have gotten that as me 

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:14.220
 I have recovered used now 

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:16.860
 is fun but in w3 have three 

00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:18.600
 Rounds played and three round ecology 

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:19.440
 and since then I never have the game 

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:21.270
 touched again 

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:23.540
 but now in the last games rest 

00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:28.650
 not a single hacker in my knowledge 

00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:29.940
 what you really like so and so 

00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:39.630
 I would say that was it with the 

00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:41.010
 today also follow times less people 

00:07:39.630 --> 00:07:44.190
 That's it with today's result 

00:07:41.010 --> 00:07:46.470
 Let's see what's next 

00:07:44.190 --> 00:07:50.130
 has to be a bit orderly again 

00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:51.690
 bring in my video upload to 

00:07:50.130 --> 00:07:52.860
 example challenge me did not come for a long time 

00:07:51.690 --> 00:07:54.200
 That's what I have to do again 

00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:57.120
 bring 

00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:58.590
 but well what should I say skin in 

00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:01.590
 let yourself be surprised 

00:07:58.590 --> 00:08:03.419
 until the next video basdorf me 

00:08:01.590 --> 00:08:06.150
 Try mw3 next time though 

00:08:03.419 --> 00:08:07.850
 There are quite a few in my knowledge 

00:08:06.150 --> 00:08:10.310
 hacker at work 

00:08:07.850 --> 00:08:15.330
 which is why the whole thing a bit 

00:08:10.310 --> 00:08:19.130
 was more complicated once was eight 

00:08:15.330 --> 00:08:19.130
 but very good
