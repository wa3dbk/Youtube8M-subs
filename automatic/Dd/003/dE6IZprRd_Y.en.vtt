either<00:00:22.599> the<00:00:23.599> forward<00:00:23.900> gear<00:00:24.349> you<00:00:24.650> can<00:00:24.710> see<00:00:25.009> that

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:25.720 
either the forward gear you can see that

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.620 
either the forward gear you can see that
has<00:00:26.720> two<00:00:27.020> teeth<00:00:27.320> knocked<00:00:27.650> out<00:00:27.860> of<00:00:28.099> it

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:28.630 
has two teeth knocked out of it

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:32.340 
has two teeth knocked out of it
I've<00:00:29.630> seen<00:00:29.930> this<00:00:30.140> a<00:00:30.380> whole<00:00:30.710> bunch<00:00:31.189> in<00:00:31.489> the<00:00:31.640> past

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:32.350 
I've seen this a whole bunch in the past

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:37.660 
I've seen this a whole bunch in the past
usually<00:00:33.350> what<00:00:33.649> happens<00:00:35.380> you<00:00:36.380> hit<00:00:36.890> some<00:00:37.309> kind

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:37.670 
usually what happens you hit some kind

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:40.900 
usually what happens you hit some kind
of<00:00:37.760> obstruction<00:00:38.300> in<00:00:38.690> the<00:00:38.720> in<00:00:39.140> the<00:00:39.260> water<00:00:39.910> stump

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:40.910 
of obstruction in the in the water stump

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:45.939 
of obstruction in the in the water stump
or<00:00:41.390> anything<00:00:42.230> and<00:00:43.149> it<00:00:44.149> weakens<00:00:45.050> those<00:00:45.620> teeth

00:00:45.939 --> 00:00:45.949 
or anything and it weakens those teeth

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:50.110 
or anything and it weakens those teeth
these<00:00:46.160> teeth<00:00:46.550> or<00:00:46.910> these<00:00:47.359> gears<00:00:47.870> are<00:00:49.120> extremely

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:50.120 
these teeth or these gears are extremely

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.939 
these teeth or these gears are extremely
hard<00:00:50.539> and<00:00:52.420> what<00:00:53.420> happens<00:00:53.780> is<00:00:53.960> they<00:00:54.140> built

00:00:54.939 --> 00:00:54.949 
hard and what happens is they built

00:00:54.949 --> 00:01:00.430 
hard and what happens is they built
crack<00:00:55.309> and<00:00:55.640> then<00:00:57.190> as<00:00:58.190> time<00:00:58.670> goes<00:00:59.210> on<00:00:59.420> at<00:01:00.019> any

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:00.440 
crack and then as time goes on at any

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.819 
crack and then as time goes on at any
given<00:01:00.739> second<00:01:01.249> any<00:01:01.699> given<00:01:02.030> moment<00:01:02.440> the<00:01:03.440> teeth

00:01:03.819 --> 00:01:03.829 
given second any given moment the teeth

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:06.100 
given second any given moment the teeth
will<00:01:04.010> just<00:01:04.190> break<00:01:04.400> off<00:01:04.610> if<00:01:04.850> it's<00:01:05.030> like<00:01:05.269> usually

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:06.110 
will just break off if it's like usually

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:07.810 
will just break off if it's like usually
the<00:01:06.590> teeth<00:01:06.770> break<00:01:07.010> off<00:01:07.220> when<00:01:07.430> every<00:01:07.640> year

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:07.820 
the teeth break off when every year

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.050 
the teeth break off when every year
under<00:01:08.090> heavy<00:01:08.570> load<00:01:08.870> so<00:01:09.200> like<00:01:09.470> if<00:01:09.620> you're

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.060 
under heavy load so like if you're

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.480 
under heavy load so like if you're
cruising<00:01:11.060> along<00:01:11.090> and<00:01:11.540> you<00:01:11.920> mash<00:01:12.920> on<00:01:13.220> it<00:01:13.370> pretty

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:13.490 
cruising along and you mash on it pretty

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.510 
cruising along and you mash on it pretty
hard<00:01:13.790> that's<00:01:14.509> when<00:01:14.899> it<00:01:15.020> does<00:01:15.290> it<00:01:15.470> and<00:01:15.590> that's

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:16.520 
hard that's when it does it and that's

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.340 
hard that's when it does it and that's
what<00:01:16.700> this<00:01:16.880> one<00:01:17.090> done<00:01:17.329> and<00:01:17.720> we<00:01:18.110> caught<00:01:18.320> it

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:18.350 
what this one done and we caught it

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:23.319 
what this one done and we caught it
before<00:01:18.829> it<00:01:19.189> completely<00:01:20.149> shelled<00:01:20.570> out<00:01:22.329> I've

00:01:23.319 --> 00:01:23.329 
before it completely shelled out I've

00:01:23.329 --> 00:01:25.149 
before it completely shelled out I've
checked<00:01:23.689> all<00:01:23.869> the<00:01:24.049> bearings<00:01:24.439> all<00:01:24.920> the

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:25.159 
checked all the bearings all the

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:28.389 
checked all the bearings all the
bearings<00:01:25.460> are<00:01:25.640> good<00:01:25.990> the<00:01:26.990> prop<00:01:27.259> shaft<00:01:27.290> is<00:01:28.100> not

00:01:28.389 --> 00:01:28.399 
bearings are good the prop shaft is not

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:35.100 
bearings are good the prop shaft is not
bent<00:01:30.009> there's<00:01:31.009> the<00:01:31.960> drive<00:01:32.960> shaft<00:01:33.320> tube<00:01:34.250> or

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:35.110 
bent there's the drive shaft tube or

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:41.289 
bent there's the drive shaft tube or
cavity<00:01:36.549> there's<00:01:37.549> the<00:01:37.969> shift'<00:01:38.299> cavity<00:01:40.119> here<00:01:41.119> is

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:41.299 
cavity there's the shift' cavity here is

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:45.249 
cavity there's the shift' cavity here is
the<00:01:41.479> drive<00:01:41.750> shaft<00:01:43.329> there<00:01:44.329> is<00:01:44.479> a<00:01:44.509> wafer<00:01:44.750> bearing

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:45.259 
the drive shaft there is a wafer bearing

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:49.709 
the drive shaft there is a wafer bearing
on<00:01:45.409> that<00:01:45.590> end<00:01:45.799> of<00:01:45.950> it<00:01:45.979> that's<00:01:46.219> still<00:01:46.969> good

00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:49.719 

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:53.740 

shift<00:01:50.719> block<00:01:51.110> with<00:01:51.890> the<00:01:52.189> thrust<00:01:52.670> bearings<00:01:53.149> all

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
shift block with the thrust bearings all

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.380 
shift block with the thrust bearings all
the<00:01:53.960> bearings<00:01:54.229> are<00:01:54.409> good<00:01:54.560> and<00:01:55.119> so<00:01:56.119> basically

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
the bearings are good and so basically

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.730 
the bearings are good and so basically
what<00:01:56.570> I<00:01:56.630> want<00:01:56.810> to<00:01:56.869> do<00:01:57.969> since<00:01:58.969> this<00:01:59.210> is<00:01:59.450> an<00:01:59.960> 89

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:00.740 
what I want to do since this is an 89

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.190 
what I want to do since this is an 89
model<00:02:01.189> I'm<00:02:01.340> going<00:02:01.399> to<00:02:02.210> probably<00:02:02.450> try<00:02:02.930> to<00:02:02.960> find

some good used parts and we'll put this

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:15.880 
some good used parts and we'll put this
puppy<00:02:14.360> back<00:02:14.600> together<00:02:14.750> probably<00:02:15.500> for<00:02:15.680> less

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
puppy back together probably for less

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:19.150 
puppy back together probably for less
than<00:02:16.070> $100<00:02:16.730> I<00:02:16.910> hope<00:02:17.470> if<00:02:18.470> you<00:02:18.530> put<00:02:18.800> all<00:02:19.130> new

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
than $100 I hope if you put all new

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.430 
than $100 I hope if you put all new
gears<00:02:19.850> in<00:02:20.060> it<00:02:20.150> you<00:02:20.360> put<00:02:20.570> a<00:02:20.890> forward<00:02:21.890> gear

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
gears in it you put a forward gear

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.480 
gears in it you put a forward gear
and<00:02:23.160> a<00:02:23.400> reverse<00:02:23.730> gear<00:02:24.120> clutch<00:02:24.840> dog<00:02:25.220> new<00:02:26.220> clutch

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:26.490 
and a reverse gear clutch dog new clutch

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:30.290 
and a reverse gear clutch dog new clutch
dog<00:02:26.760> spring<00:02:27.270> and<00:02:27.630> a<00:02:28.590> seal<00:02:28.830> kit<00:02:29.100> will<00:02:29.970> probably

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
dog spring and a seal kit will probably

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:34.480 
dog spring and a seal kit will probably
cost<00:02:30.450> you<00:02:30.660> around<00:02:30.780> $400<00:02:31.770> parts<00:02:32.700> and<00:02:32.820> labor<00:02:33.030> so

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:34.490 
cost you around $400 parts and labor so

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:37.310 
cost you around $400 parts and labor so
this<00:02:35.490> is<00:02:35.670> going<00:02:35.910> to<00:02:35.970> be<00:02:36.150> another<00:02:36.870> part<00:02:37.170> to<00:02:37.230> this

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
this is going to be another part to this

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.260 
this is going to be another part to this
video<00:02:37.710> we'll<00:02:38.490> get<00:02:38.610> it<00:02:38.700> all<00:02:38.790> put<00:02:38.970> back<00:02:39.000> together

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
video we'll get it all put back together

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:42.890 
video we'll get it all put back together
and<00:02:40.430> we'll<00:02:41.430> see<00:02:41.610> how<00:02:41.760> it<00:02:41.850> goes<00:02:41.880> you'll<00:02:42.690> have<00:02:42.840> a

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
and we'll see how it goes you'll have a

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.200 
and we'll see how it goes you'll have a
good<00:02:43.050> day
