00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:07.480
 i 

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:12.930
 Hi, I'm Dr. Robert Young Solmicro 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.820
 biologist specifically in research 

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:17.250
 cellular and I would like to show you a 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.170
 experiment that I call you first and what 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:23.340
 that we are going to be testing today is water 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.990
 to see which one turns on my light and here 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.880
 I have two of the most water bottles 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.850
 popular that I'll be pouring in 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:32.359
 these glasses we are going to start filling the 

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:34.530
 first glass 

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:36.570
 excited 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.550
 and now we will continue with our 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:43.140
 second bottle of water 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:43.140
 and fill the glass 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:51.100
 Now we will go with a bottle of water 

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:53.620
 which called miraculous water ph which is 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:56.230
 a water rich in electrons we are going to 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:01:00.519
 fill the glass now let's see which of 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:02.920
 these waters to turn on the light here 

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:06.400
 I have my project what I will put in 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:10.270
 water and not this water in particular not 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:13.060
 it makes me sound like a song 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:15.250
 what I just said let's go to the next 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:19.899
 this other popular water does not either 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:23.729
 turn on the light let's go now the water ph 

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:23.729
 miraculous to see if the light comes on 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:30.070
 Now what we have here is a water that 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:31.960
 contains electrons that we can 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:34.410
 measure this electric potential called 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:36.670
 reduction potential oxidation 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:39.220
 we are really moving the potential 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:40.810
 electric water and its ability to 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:42.969
 give light that continues to increase its 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:45.289
 brightness 

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:49.939
 let's go back to these other waters 

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:52.369
 popular as you will see they do not make the 

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:55.130
 Light water is water everywhere but 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:57.350
 none is apt to take I want to say 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:59.810
 there are over 700 bottles of water in the 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:03.020
 market today and there is none that is 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:04.850
 able to turn on my light and that's why it's 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:07.250
 that it is important that you handle what 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:11.550
 you take because water is essential for the 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:15.150
 life and that water has to be started 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:18.540
 and electrolyzed so that we can 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:20.820
 give light and more light in our body is 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:25.560
 important is why I wanted 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:27.210
 show you this experiment today so that 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.610
 start thinking about the type of water 

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:31.950
 they are taking and that the best water to 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:35.120
 take is one that has vih of so 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.120
 minus nine to nine and a half 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:42.720
 and has a potential for reducing the 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:44.730
 oxidation of minus 150 minus 200 that is 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.470
 measured in electrons or millivolts if 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.390
 You have a water that you would like me 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.460
 every time you want to turn on the light which 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:52.590
 I have not found yet but we continue 

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:54.300
 looking for most water bottles 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:56.730
 out there they contain no potential 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:03:00.200
 electric or energy that literally 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:00.200
 area turn on your internal light
