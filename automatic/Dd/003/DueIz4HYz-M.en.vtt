00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:40.610 
behavioral things and eyes and this is

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:42.610 
behavioral things and eyes and this is
not<00:00:40.730> the<00:00:40.880> other<00:00:41.000> thing<00:00:41.239> but<00:00:41.420> it's<00:00:41.570> also<00:00:41.720> it's

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:42.620 
not the other thing but it's also it's

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:49.130 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:51.450 

yeah<00:00:49.760> I<00:00:49.790> think<00:00:49.940> in<00:00:50.120> the<00:00:50.210> pilot<00:00:50.570> script<00:00:50.870> DJ

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:51.460 
yeah I think in the pilot script DJ

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:54.460 
yeah I think in the pilot script DJ
refers<00:00:52.460> to<00:00:52.610> him<00:00:52.730> as<00:00:52.760> a<00:00:52.970> John<00:00:53.630> Wayne<00:00:53.930> you<00:00:54.350> know

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:54.470 
refers to him as a John Wayne you know

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:56.680 
refers to him as a John Wayne you know
that<00:00:54.650> was<00:00:54.770> the<00:00:54.920> way<00:00:55.070> he<00:00:55.100> idolized<00:00:56.060> his<00:00:56.420> dad

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:56.690 
that was the way he idolized his dad

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:59.710 
that was the way he idolized his dad
growing<00:00:57.020> up<00:00:57.290> a<00:00:57.680> blind<00:00:58.550> guy<00:00:58.850> who<00:00:58.910> just<00:00:59.480> doesn't

00:00:59.710 --> 00:00:59.720 
growing up a blind guy who just doesn't

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.600 
growing up a blind guy who just doesn't
let<00:00:59.900> it<00:00:59.930> get<00:01:00.260> in<00:01:00.380> the<00:01:00.410> way

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:03.610 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:05.430 

I<00:01:03.760> think<00:01:04.480> the<00:01:04.540> relationship<00:01:04.989> between<00:01:05.080> Mel<00:01:05.410> and

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:05.440 
I think the relationship between Mel and

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.680 
I think the relationship between Mel and
Henry<00:01:05.770> is<00:01:05.800> something<00:01:06.400> that<00:01:06.550> a<00:01:06.910> lot<00:01:07.000> of<00:01:07.210> fathers

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:07.690 
Henry is something that a lot of fathers

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:10.640 
Henry is something that a lot of fathers
and<00:01:08.110> sons<00:01:08.170> sort<00:01:08.710> of<00:01:08.830> aspire<00:01:09.310> to<00:01:09.640> you<00:01:09.940> know
