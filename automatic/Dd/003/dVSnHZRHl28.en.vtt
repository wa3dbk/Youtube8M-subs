00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:22.310 
and then cloud died right after me and
we<00:00:20.880> were<00:00:20.939> like<00:00:21.060> well<00:00:21.660> this<00:00:21.720> game<00:00:21.900> might<00:00:22.140> be<00:00:22.170> a

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
we were like well this game might be a

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.400 
we were like well this game might be a
stomp<00:00:22.650> but<00:00:23.100> they<00:00:23.869> didn't<00:00:24.869> put<00:00:25.050> up<00:00:25.170> as<00:00:25.289> much

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
stomp but they didn't put up as much

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.140 
stomp but they didn't put up as much
pressure<00:00:25.680> it<00:00:26.310> was<00:00:26.460> more<00:00:26.670> of<00:00:26.699> us<00:00:26.880> making

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
pressure it was more of us making

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.339 
pressure it was more of us making
mistakes<00:00:27.510> than<00:00:27.660> them<00:00:27.779> actually<00:00:27.990> playing

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
mistakes than them actually playing

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.349 
mistakes than them actually playing
really<00:00:28.500> well<00:00:28.590> so<00:00:28.920> we<00:00:29.519> recovered<00:00:29.970> after<00:00:30.090> that

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
really well so we recovered after that

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.510 
really well so we recovered after that
and<00:00:30.539> got<00:00:30.689> a<00:00:30.720> good<00:00:31.140> catch<00:00:31.320> or<00:00:31.560> good<00:00:31.920> few<00:00:32.160> catches

behind<00:00:56.430> early<00:00:56.670> but<00:00:56.969> you<00:00:57.149> had<00:00:57.239> something<00:00:57.629> to

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
behind early but you had something to

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.599 
behind early but you had something to
say<00:00:57.930> about<00:00:57.960> scars<00:00:58.440> item<00:00:58.739> build<00:00:58.920> I<00:00:59.129> believe<00:00:59.489> in

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
say about scars item build I believe in

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:00.770 
say about scars item build I believe in
that<00:00:59.699> game<00:00:59.940> do<00:01:00.359> you<00:01:00.420> think<00:01:00.539> you<00:01:00.600> could<00:01:00.660> have

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
that game do you think you could have

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.240 
that game do you think you could have
done<00:01:00.840> something<00:01:00.989> better<00:01:01.199> I<00:01:01.440> think<00:01:02.010> he<00:01:02.160> went

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
done something better I think he went

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.369 
done something better I think he went
deathcap<00:01:02.640> early<00:01:03.149> it<00:01:03.420> would<00:01:03.570> have<00:01:03.719> just<00:01:03.989> been<00:01:04.260> a

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
deathcap early it would have just been a

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:05.780 
deathcap early it would have just been a
lot<00:01:04.589> more<00:01:04.619> damage<00:01:04.890> instead<00:01:05.280> of<00:01:05.460> just<00:01:05.580> trying

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
lot more damage instead of just trying

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.160 
lot more damage instead of just trying
to<00:01:05.850> instant<00:01:06.150> kill<00:01:06.270> one<00:01:06.420> person<00:01:06.450> because<00:01:07.020> I

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
to instant kill one person because I

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.570 
to instant kill one person because I
don't<00:01:07.560> think<00:01:07.680> he<00:01:07.740> gotta<00:01:07.920> give<00:01:08.100> on<00:01:08.250> anyone<00:01:08.549> but

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
don't think he gotta give on anyone but

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.240 
don't think he gotta give on anyone but
besides<00:01:09.090> that<00:01:09.180> he<00:01:09.600> played<00:01:09.810> well<00:01:10.020> yeah<00:01:10.979> and<00:01:11.130> we

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
then once they come in they group up I'm

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:55.700 
then once they come in they group up I'm

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:57.980 
now they have no chance of killing me
and<00:01:57.090> then<00:01:57.180> they<00:01:57.270> went<00:01:57.390> all<00:01:57.509> meals<00:01:57.689> okay<00:01:57.899> I'm

and then they went all meals okay I'm
dead<00:01:58.140> I'm<00:01:58.290> out<00:01:58.439> I'm<00:01:58.469> out<00:01:58.740> and<00:01:58.950> then<00:01:59.490> we<00:02:00.240> just

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
dead I'm out I'm out and then we just

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.090 
dead I'm out I'm out and then we just
started<00:02:00.600> cleaning<00:02:00.750> up<00:02:00.960> because<00:02:01.110> even<00:02:02.009> though

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
started cleaning up because even though

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.889 
started cleaning up because even though
it<00:02:02.219> looks<00:02:02.399> like<00:02:02.579> we<00:02:02.729> won<00:02:03.390> the<00:02:03.570> fight<00:02:03.719> it<00:02:03.869> was

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
it looks like we won the fight it was

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:05.209 
it looks like we won the fight it was
mostly<00:02:04.200> bare<00:02:04.409> and<00:02:04.560> I<00:02:04.619> think<00:02:04.770> Baron<00:02:05.009> took<00:02:05.130> off

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
mostly bare and I think Baron took off

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:06.920 
mostly bare and I think Baron took off
like<00:02:05.369> forty<00:02:06.030> percent<00:02:06.240> of<00:02:06.390> all<00:02:06.479> of<00:02:06.600> them<00:02:06.719> and

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
like forty percent of all of them and

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.960 
like forty percent of all of them and
then<00:02:07.380> once<00:02:07.590> they<00:02:07.920> got<00:02:08.069> out<00:02:08.220> of<00:02:08.340> position<00:02:08.520> we

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
then once they got out of position we

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.479 
then once they got out of position we
just<00:02:09.179> got<00:02:09.750> the<00:02:09.959> free<00:02:10.170> kills<00:02:10.500> and<00:02:10.770> then<00:02:10.860> we<00:02:11.220> just

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
just got the free kills and then we just

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:12.470 
just got the free kills and then we just
got<00:02:11.640> baron<00:02:11.879> after<00:02:12.150> it

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
got baron after it

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.119 
got baron after it
and<00:02:12.599> at<00:02:13.170> that<00:02:13.260> point<00:02:13.440> it<00:02:13.620> seemed<00:02:13.920> like<00:02:14.040> you

00:02:14.119 --> 00:02:14.129 
and at that point it seemed like you

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:15.350 
and at that point it seemed like you
guys<00:02:14.159> just<00:02:14.280> controlled<00:02:14.849> the<00:02:14.879> game<00:02:14.940> throughout

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
guys just controlled the game throughout

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.570 
guys just controlled the game throughout
but<00:02:15.540> even<00:02:15.780> even<00:02:15.900> leading<00:02:16.349> up<00:02:16.590> to<00:02:16.739> that<00:02:16.769> what

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
but even even leading up to that what

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.610 
but even even leading up to that what
was<00:02:17.760> your<00:02:17.970> mindset<00:02:18.480> like<00:02:18.870> knowing<00:02:19.349> you<00:02:19.440> had

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
was your mindset like knowing you had

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.059 
was your mindset like knowing you had
such<00:02:19.830> a<00:02:19.860> poor<00:02:20.280> early<00:02:20.730> game<00:02:21.290> our<00:02:22.290> minds<00:02:22.769> i<00:02:22.830> claim

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:23.069 
such a poor early game our minds i claim

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:25.100 
such a poor early game our minds i claim
do<00:02:23.280> they<00:02:23.640> don't<00:02:24.180> really<00:02:24.269> have<00:02:24.480> a<00:02:24.510> fast<00:02:24.780> Baron

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
do they don't really have a fast Baron

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.350 
do they don't really have a fast Baron
team<00:02:25.260> so<00:02:25.799> them<00:02:26.159> doing<00:02:26.459> Baron<00:02:26.730> isn't<00:02:27.180> as<00:02:27.269> scary

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
team so them doing Baron isn't as scary

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.690 
team so them doing Baron isn't as scary
as<00:02:27.659> we<00:02:28.140> need<00:02:28.349> to<00:02:28.500> be<00:02:28.680> like<00:02:28.830> oh<00:02:29.010> they<00:02:29.489> could<00:02:29.610> be

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
as we need to be like oh they could be

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.550 
as we need to be like oh they could be
on<00:02:29.790> Baron<00:02:29.970> has<00:02:30.090> gone<00:02:30.239> instantly<00:02:30.480> and<00:02:30.810> so<00:02:31.170> all

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
on Baron has gone instantly and so all

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.140 
on Baron has gone instantly and so all
they<00:02:31.830> have<00:02:31.860> to<00:02:32.129> do<00:02:32.250> they<00:02:32.489> have<00:02:32.700> it<00:02:32.849> really<00:02:33.000> good

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
they have to do they have it really good

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:34.940 
they have to do they have it really good
is<00:02:33.269> catching<00:02:33.690> so<00:02:34.170> we're<00:02:34.290> just<00:02:34.319> really<00:02:34.680> scared

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
to face check unless it was one of our

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:37.190 
to face check unless it was one of our
big<00:02:36.269> things<00:02:36.510> because<00:02:36.690> they<00:02:36.870> blew<00:02:37.019> everything

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
big things because they blew everything

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.839 
big things because they blew everything
on<00:02:37.379> a<00:02:37.410> big<00:02:37.560> thing<00:02:37.739> we<00:02:38.129> still<00:02:38.370> might<00:02:38.489> be<00:02:38.610> able<00:02:38.700> to

00:02:38.839 --> 00:02:38.849 
on a big thing we still might be able to

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:40.520 
on a big thing we still might be able to
win<00:02:38.940> a<00:02:39.000> fight<00:02:39.209> so<00:02:39.480> all<00:02:39.840> we<00:02:39.959> had<00:02:40.049> to<00:02:40.079> do<00:02:40.230> is<00:02:40.349> make

about man cloud right now because he had

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:53.930 
about man cloud right now because he had

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
such a fantastic split last year and

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.059 
such a fantastic split last year and
he's<00:02:54.030> had<00:02:54.090> a<00:02:54.150> very<00:02:54.209> slow<00:02:55.200> start<00:02:55.260> there<00:02:55.829> what<00:02:56.010> do

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:56.069 
he's had a very slow start there what do

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:57.710 
he's had a very slow start there what do
you<00:02:56.129> think's<00:02:56.310> going<00:02:56.459> on<00:02:56.519> with<00:02:56.700> it<00:02:56.819> I<00:02:57.000> think

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
you think's going on with it I think

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.410 
you think's going on with it I think
it's<00:02:57.840> just<00:02:57.900> the<00:02:58.079> matter<00:02:58.590> shift<00:02:58.920> right<00:02:59.160> now

00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.420 
it's just the matter shift right now

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:02.960 
it's just the matter shift right now
most<00:03:00.420> of<00:03:00.569> his<00:03:00.720> champions<00:03:01.140> are<00:03:01.319> not<00:03:02.099> in<00:03:02.370> like

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
most of his champions are not in like

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.089 
most of his champions are not in like
the<00:03:03.120> star<00:03:03.359> like<00:03:04.230> into<00:03:04.470> the<00:03:04.530> show<00:03:04.709> light<00:03:04.890> I

00:03:05.089 --> 00:03:05.099 
the star like into the show light I

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:08.420 
the star like into the show light I
think<00:03:05.640> he<00:03:05.940> just<00:03:06.150> needs<00:03:06.359> to<00:03:06.590> be<00:03:07.590> comfortable<00:03:08.220> on

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
think he just needs to be comfortable on

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:11.180 
think he just needs to be comfortable on
more<00:03:08.730> of<00:03:08.970> the<00:03:09.209> meta<00:03:09.660> champions<00:03:10.079> right<00:03:10.200> now<00:03:10.349> cuz

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
more of the meta champions right now cuz

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:14.210 
more of the meta champions right now cuz
mostly<00:03:11.910> his<00:03:12.120> Riven<00:03:12.660> said<00:03:13.170> most<00:03:13.799> of<00:03:13.890> that<00:03:14.010> got

mostly his Riven said most of that got

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.640 
mostly his Riven said most of that got
nerve<00:03:14.430> and<00:03:15.120> he<00:03:15.510> needs<00:03:15.690> to<00:03:15.750> focus<00:03:15.900> on<00:03:16.140> more<00:03:16.319> like

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
nerve and he needs to focus on more like

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.620 
nerve and he needs to focus on more like
KP<00:03:17.130> champions<00:03:17.609> because<00:03:17.700> he<00:03:17.849> likes<00:03:18.060> going<00:03:18.299> ad

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
KP champions because he likes going ad

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:22.099 
KP champions because he likes going ad
melee<00:03:19.620> all<00:03:19.859> the<00:03:20.099> time<00:03:20.280> and<00:03:20.540> usually<00:03:21.540> I'm<00:03:21.870> there

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:22.109

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.280 
to back him up before but I think God

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:28.099 
to back him up before but I think God
shifting<00:03:26.280> or<00:03:26.400> like<00:03:27.269> place<00:03:27.480> all<00:03:27.660> right<00:03:27.750> now<00:03:27.900> is

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:28.109 
shifting or like place all right now is

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:29.360 
shifting or like place all right now is
I<00:03:28.139> think<00:03:28.349> gonna<00:03:28.680> be<00:03:28.799> better<00:03:29.040> in<00:03:29.160> the<00:03:29.220> long<00:03:29.310> run

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:45.289 
game I think that's pretty much where
we're<00:03:44.220> faltering<00:03:44.700> really<00:03:44.940> hard<00:03:45.120> is<00:03:45.269> just

00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:45.299 
we're faltering really hard is just

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:47.240 
we're faltering really hard is just
we're<00:03:45.900> getting<00:03:46.139> outplayed<00:03:46.260> in<00:03:46.470> lots<00:03:46.919> of<00:03:47.040> lanes

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
we're getting outplayed in lots of lanes

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.430 
we're getting outplayed in lots of lanes
lots<00:03:47.669> of<00:03:47.790> times<00:03:47.970> if<00:03:48.209> we<00:03:48.599> improve<00:03:48.870> that<00:03:49.079> because

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
lots of times if we improve that because

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.440 
lots of times if we improve that because
our<00:03:50.010> biggest<00:03:50.489> ring<00:03:50.609> was<00:03:50.819> our<00:03:50.940> early<00:03:51.150> game<00:03:51.299> is

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
our biggest ring was our early game is

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:53.509 
our biggest ring was our early game is
in<00:03:51.540> our<00:03:51.630> band<00:03:51.810> pics<00:03:52.079> and<00:03:52.319> if<00:03:52.829> we<00:03:52.980> can<00:03:53.099> adjust<00:03:53.430> to

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:53.519 
in our band pics and if we can adjust to

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:56.030 
in our band pics and if we can adjust to
our<00:03:53.609> early<00:03:54.120> game<00:03:54.329> just<00:03:55.169> as<00:03:55.349> strong<00:03:55.709> as<00:03:55.829> we<00:03:55.919> had

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
our early game just as strong as we had

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.470 
our early game just as strong as we had
it<00:03:56.160> before<00:03:56.250> I<00:03:56.459> think<00:03:56.760> would<00:03:56.910> be<00:03:57.150> a<00:03:57.180> top

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
it before I think would be a top

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.089 
it before I think would be a top
