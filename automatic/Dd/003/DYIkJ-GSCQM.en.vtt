00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
foundation to do this I generally use

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.190 
foundation to do this I generally use
the<00:02:35.550> Revlon<00:02:35.970> Colorstay<00:02:36.300> whipped<00:02:36.540> and<00:02:37.050> now

the Revlon Colorstay whipped and now

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.860 
the Revlon Colorstay whipped and now
it's<00:02:37.380> time<00:02:37.590> to<00:02:37.620> apply<00:02:37.920> your<00:02:38.370> foundation<00:02:38.550> and<00:02:39.210> a

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
it's time to apply your foundation and a

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.000 
it's time to apply your foundation and a
mistake<00:02:40.170> that<00:02:40.290> people<00:02:40.410> make<00:02:40.560> is<00:02:40.710> that<00:02:40.860> they

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
mistake that people make is that they

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.430 
mistake that people make is that they
apply<00:02:41.400> too<00:02:41.460> much<00:02:41.790> foundation<00:02:42.690> or<00:02:43.080> they'll<00:02:43.260> use

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
apply too much foundation or they'll use

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.500 
apply too much foundation or they'll use
too<00:02:43.740> thick<00:02:44.010> of<00:02:44.130> a<00:02:44.190> product<00:02:44.640> and<00:02:44.820> because<00:02:45.420> they

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
too thick of a product and because they

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:46.970 
too thick of a product and because they
want<00:02:45.750> to<00:02:45.900> just<00:02:46.230> go<00:02:46.350> ahead<00:02:46.380> and<00:02:46.590> get<00:02:46.770> it<00:02:46.890> all

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
want to just go ahead and get it all

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.230 
want to just go ahead and get it all
done<00:02:47.040> because<00:02:47.490> I<00:02:47.550> think<00:02:47.610> it'll<00:02:47.910> be<00:02:47.970> quicker

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:48.240 
done because I think it'll be quicker

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:49.400 
done because I think it'll be quicker
and<00:02:48.510> it<00:02:48.840> won't<00:02:49.080> work

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
and it won't work

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.440 
and it won't work
so<00:02:49.950> what<00:02:50.160> you<00:02:50.310> want<00:02:50.460> to<00:02:50.490> do<00:02:50.610> is<00:02:50.790> get<00:02:50.940> a<00:02:51.000> small

so what you want to do is get a small
amount<00:02:51.810> of<00:02:51.960> foundation<00:02:52.170> and<00:02:52.680> I<00:02:52.740> just<00:02:52.950> dot<00:02:53.250> it

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
do that I'm going to take an even

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:09.170 
do that I'm going to take an even
smaller<00:03:07.080> amount<00:03:07.320> of<00:03:07.740> foundation<00:03:07.950> and<00:03:08.490> dot<00:03:09.000> it

smaller amount of foundation and dot it

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.510 
smaller amount of foundation and dot it
on<00:03:09.360> those<00:03:09.600> areas<00:03:09.900> where<00:03:10.080> I<00:03:10.320> want<00:03:10.500> to<00:03:11.040> have<00:03:11.310> that

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:11.520 
on those areas where I want to have that

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:13.760 
on those areas where I want to have that
full<00:03:11.760> coverage<00:03:12.210> then<00:03:12.690> I<00:03:12.720> will<00:03:12.900> take<00:03:13.080> my<00:03:13.140> flat

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:13.770 
full coverage then I will take my flat

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:15.710 
full coverage then I will take my flat
top<00:03:14.070> brush<00:03:14.340> and<00:03:14.760> I'm<00:03:15.180> going<00:03:15.390> to<00:03:15.480> do<00:03:15.690> a

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
top brush and I'm going to do a

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.930 
top brush and I'm going to do a
stippling<00:03:16.500> motion<00:03:16.560> so<00:03:17.130> you<00:03:17.160> just<00:03:17.490> pass<00:03:17.730> your

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
stippling motion so you just pass your

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.090 
stippling motion so you just pass your
brush<00:03:18.150> up<00:03:18.360> and<00:03:18.450> down<00:03:18.570> like<00:03:18.900> this<00:03:18.930> I<00:03:19.440> tend<00:03:19.860> to<00:03:19.920> do

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
brush up and down like this I tend to do

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.220 
brush up and down like this I tend to do
it<00:03:20.220> fast<00:03:20.490> and<00:03:20.730> I<00:03:20.850> just<00:03:21.060> move<00:03:21.660> it<00:03:21.780> around<00:03:21.870> in

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
it fast and I just move it around in

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.500 
it fast and I just move it around in
that<00:03:22.410> area<00:03:22.680> that<00:03:23.070> needs<00:03:23.280> to<00:03:23.400> be<00:03:23.430> full<00:03:24.120> coverage

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
that area that needs to be full coverage

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.060 
that area that needs to be full coverage
so<00:03:24.900> I'll<00:03:25.020> kind<00:03:25.230> of<00:03:25.290> show<00:03:25.350> you<00:03:25.530> from<00:03:25.709> the<00:03:25.860> side

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.070 
so I'll kind of show you from the side

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:30.080 
so I'll kind of show you from the side
what<00:03:26.310> it<00:03:26.400> looks<00:03:26.580> like<00:03:28.160> and<00:03:29.160> I'm<00:03:29.640> just<00:03:29.820> going<00:03:29.970> to

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
what it looks like and I'm just going to

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.540 
what it looks like and I'm just going to
do<00:03:30.180> that<00:03:30.330> in<00:03:30.600> the<00:03:30.900> areas<00:03:31.380> that<00:03:31.410> need<00:03:31.740> it<00:03:31.950> now

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:32.550 
do that in the areas that need it now

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:34.640 
do that in the areas that need it now
why<00:03:32.820> this<00:03:32.880> works<00:03:33.300> better<00:03:33.630> than<00:03:33.930> just<00:03:34.200> pushing

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
why this works better than just pushing

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:36.800 
why this works better than just pushing
the<00:03:35.010> product<00:03:35.250> around<00:03:35.730> moving<00:03:36.120> it<00:03:36.270> around<00:03:36.390> or

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
the product around moving it around or

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:39.020 
the product around moving it around or
I'm<00:03:37.350> using<00:03:37.620> a<00:03:37.860> sponge<00:03:38.130> is<00:03:38.520> because<00:03:38.820> this

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
I'm using a sponge is because this

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:41.090 
I'm using a sponge is because this
allows<00:03:39.420> it<00:03:39.660> to<00:03:39.690> stay<00:03:39.989> concentrated<00:03:40.860> in<00:03:41.010> the

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:41.100 
allows it to stay concentrated in the

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:42.170 
allows it to stay concentrated in the
area<00:03:41.459> that<00:03:41.610> needs<00:03:41.820> it

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
area that needs it

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:43.340 
area that needs it
so<00:03:42.390> you're<00:03:42.510> making<00:03:42.840> sure<00:03:42.900> that<00:03:43.200> you're

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:43.350 
so you're making sure that you're

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:45.140 
so you're making sure that you're
getting<00:03:43.590> that<00:03:43.709> full<00:03:43.920> coverage<00:03:44.190> but<00:03:44.880> with<00:03:45.060> the

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
getting that full coverage but with the

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:46.760 
getting that full coverage but with the
passing<00:03:45.600> motion<00:03:45.930> the<00:03:46.050> stippling<00:03:46.440> motion

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:46.770 
passing motion the stippling motion

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:48.410 
passing motion the stippling motion
you're<00:03:46.920> allowing<00:03:47.250> it<00:03:47.370> to<00:03:47.430> blend<00:03:47.790> out<00:03:48.030> as<00:03:48.209> well

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 
you're allowing it to blend out as well

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:49.970 
you're allowing it to blend out as well
so<00:03:48.780> it<00:03:48.870> doesn't<00:03:49.170> look<00:03:49.290> like<00:03:49.350> you<00:03:49.560> have<00:03:49.590> pockets

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
so it doesn't look like you have pockets

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:52.070 
so it doesn't look like you have pockets
of<00:03:50.340> huge<00:03:50.670> product<00:03:51.209> but<00:03:51.660> after<00:03:51.930> you've

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:52.080 
of huge product but after you've

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.080 
of huge product but after you've
completely<00:03:52.560> stippled<00:03:53.100> it<00:03:53.220> in<00:03:53.370> if<00:03:53.520> you<00:03:53.730> still

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
completely stippled it in if you still

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:56.150 
completely stippled it in if you still
need<00:03:54.120> covers<00:03:54.660> take<00:03:54.930> an<00:03:55.050> even<00:03:55.410> smaller<00:03:55.920> amount

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 
need covers take an even smaller amount

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.640 
need covers take an even smaller amount
and<00:03:56.700> just<00:03:57.090> go<00:03:57.239> back<00:03:57.450> through<00:03:57.780> and<00:03:58.020> continue<00:03:58.560> to

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
and just go back through and continue to

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:00.560 
and just go back through and continue to
add<00:03:58.680> layers<00:03:59.040> until<00:03:59.459> you<00:03:59.520> get<00:03:59.730> desired<00:04:00.060> effect

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:00.570 
add layers until you get desired effect

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:02.120 
add layers until you get desired effect
that<00:04:00.720> you<00:04:00.840> want<00:04:01.110> so<00:04:01.380> another<00:04:01.830> thing<00:04:01.890> that<00:04:02.010> you

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:02.130 
that you want so another thing that you

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:03.890 
that you want so another thing that you
could<00:04:02.310> do<00:04:02.489> if<00:04:02.700> you<00:04:02.760> have<00:04:03.150> a<00:04:03.180> really<00:04:03.480> really<00:04:03.720> dry

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
could do if you have a really really dry

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:05.780 
could do if you have a really really dry
skin<00:04:03.959> and<00:04:04.350> you<00:04:04.440> get<00:04:04.620> the<00:04:04.739> cake<00:04:04.950> faced<00:04:05.220> with<00:04:05.760> a

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790 
skin and you get the cake faced with a

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:08.030 
skin and you get the cake faced with a
powder<00:04:06.090> is<00:04:06.330> completely<00:04:06.480> to<00:04:07.230> avoid<00:04:07.650> the<00:04:07.830> powder

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040

00:04:58.170 --> 00:04:58.180 
reason that you might still have cake

00:04:58.180 --> 00:04:59.760 
reason that you might still have cake
face<00:04:58.390> is<00:04:58.570> you<00:04:58.930> try<00:04:59.140> to<00:04:59.200> do<00:04:59.380> this<00:04:59.500> stippling

00:04:59.760 --> 00:04:59.770 
face is you try to do this stippling

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:02.010 
face is you try to do this stippling
motion<00:05:00.220> is<00:05:00.310> that<00:05:00.490> your<00:05:00.670> brush<00:05:00.910> might<00:05:01.390> be<00:05:01.600> too

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:02.020 
motion is that your brush might be too

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:04.050 
motion is that your brush might be too
dirty<00:05:02.290> so<00:05:02.830> you<00:05:02.920> see<00:05:03.130> for<00:05:03.250> example<00:05:03.370> this<00:05:03.820> one

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:04.060 
dirty so you see for example this one

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:05.970 
dirty so you see for example this one
it's<00:05:04.420> not<00:05:04.660> really<00:05:04.990> moving<00:05:05.230> around<00:05:05.710> much

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:05.980 
it's not really moving around much

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:07.830 
it's not really moving around much
because<00:05:06.310> it's<00:05:06.490> so<00:05:06.700> dirty<00:05:06.970> and<00:05:07.270> what<00:05:07.720> it's

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:07.840 
because it's so dirty and what it's

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:09.690 
because it's so dirty and what it's
going<00:05:07.870> to<00:05:08.050> do<00:05:08.140> is<00:05:08.320> possibly<00:05:08.560> deposit<00:05:09.430> even

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:09.700 
going to do is possibly deposit even

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:11.730 
going to do is possibly deposit even
more<00:05:09.940> product<00:05:10.420> and<00:05:10.600> just<00:05:11.020> not<00:05:11.320> really<00:05:11.560> do<00:05:11.710> a

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:11.740 
more product and just not really do a

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:13.350 
more product and just not really do a
good<00:05:11.890> job<00:05:11.950> at<00:05:12.280> stippling<00:05:12.760> and<00:05:12.850> moving<00:05:13.240> it

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:13.360 
good job at stippling and moving it

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:15.720 
good job at stippling and moving it
around<00:05:13.480> so<00:05:14.140> that's<00:05:14.620> why<00:05:14.920> I<00:05:14.950> have<00:05:15.190> so<00:05:15.370> many<00:05:15.520> of

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:15.730 
around so that's why I have so many of

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:17.430 
around so that's why I have so many of
these<00:05:15.790> face<00:05:16.150> brushes<00:05:16.540> so<00:05:16.690> what<00:05:16.810> I<00:05:16.840> wanted<00:05:17.230> so

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:18.880 
what I would do is just switch to

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:21.390 
what I would do is just switch to
another<00:05:19.090> face<00:05:19.510> brush<00:05:19.780> or<00:05:20.110> take<00:05:20.920> a<00:05:20.950> dampened
