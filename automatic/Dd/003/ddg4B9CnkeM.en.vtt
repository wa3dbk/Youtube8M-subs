00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:39.749 
but I found this one as an open box unit
for<00:01:36.719> $15<00:01:37.719> so<00:01:38.140> I<00:01:38.469> didn't<00:01:39.219> think<00:01:39.369> that<00:01:39.520> I<00:01:39.579> could

00:01:39.749 --> 00:01:39.759 
for $15 so I didn't think that I could

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:42.300 
for $15 so I didn't think that I could
really<00:01:39.909> go<00:01:40.119> wrong<00:01:40.649> I've<00:01:41.649> actually<00:01:41.799> had<00:01:42.130> it<00:01:42.159> out

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:42.310

of<00:01:42.429> the<00:01:42.490> box<00:01:42.670> and<00:01:43.000> tested<00:01:43.390> it<00:01:43.479> already<00:01:43.780> at<00:01:44.109> the

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:44.560 
of the box and tested it already at the

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.529 
of the box and tested it already at the
store<00:01:44.920> where<00:01:45.189> I<00:01:45.219> bought<00:01:45.280> it<00:01:45.520> so<00:01:45.849> I<00:01:45.879> know<00:01:46.209> the

00:01:46.529 --> 00:01:46.539 
store where I bought it so I know the

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:49.529 
store where I bought it so I know the
unit<00:01:46.750> works<00:01:46.989> and<00:01:47.349> for<00:01:47.920> $15<00:01:48.700> even<00:01:49.149> if<00:01:49.299> the<00:01:49.420> only

00:01:49.529 --> 00:01:49.539 
unit works and for $15 even if the only

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:51.119 
unit works and for $15 even if the only
thing<00:01:49.629> I<00:01:49.899> ever<00:01:50.020> do<00:01:50.229> with<00:01:50.379> it<00:01:50.500> is<00:01:50.649> play<00:01:50.979> video

thing I ever do with it is play video
games<00:01:51.549> then<00:01:52.179> I<00:01:52.299> think<00:01:52.479> it's<00:01:52.599> worth<00:01:52.780> it<00:01:52.959> and

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.110

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:53.300 
the accessories usually the $99 units
come<00:03:49.269> with<00:03:49.450> a<00:03:50.130> case<00:03:51.130> and<00:03:51.550> a<00:03:52.300> keyboard<00:03:52.510> as<00:03:52.810> well

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
come with a case and a keyboard as well

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:55.680 
come with a case and a keyboard as well
but<00:03:54.310> like<00:03:54.519> I<00:03:54.670> said<00:03:54.730> I<00:03:54.910> bought<00:03:55.150> this<00:03:55.299> one<00:03:55.480> for

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:55.690

$15

$15

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:01.199 
$15
so<00:03:57.930> after<00:03:58.930> tax<00:03:59.200> you<00:03:59.830> know<00:03:59.980> it<00:04:00.129> was<00:04:00.340> around<00:04:00.880> 20

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:01.209

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:04.979

00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:04.989 
bucks and I just didn't figure that I

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:06.780 
bucks and I just didn't figure that I
could<00:04:05.230> go<00:04:05.349> wrong<00:04:05.530> for<00:04:05.769> that<00:04:05.890> price<00:04:06.220> you<00:04:06.700> know
