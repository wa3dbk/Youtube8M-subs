somewhere<00:02:06.260> in<00:02:06.320> that<00:02:06.380> range<00:02:06.940> it's<00:02:07.940> good<00:02:08.060> for

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:08.210 
somewhere in that range it's good for

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:09.340 
somewhere in that range it's good for
them<00:02:08.300> to<00:02:08.330> compete<00:02:08.630> against<00:02:08.929> each<00:02:09.020> other<00:02:09.290> and

motion movement just going to allow you

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:31.850

to<00:02:29.800> overload<00:02:30.310> the<00:02:30.340> weight<00:02:30.670> overload<00:02:31.300> the<00:02:31.390> top

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
to overload the weight overload the top

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.050 
to overload the weight overload the top
some<00:02:32.860> people<00:02:33.100> like<00:02:33.220> to<00:02:33.250> get<00:02:33.400> all<00:02:33.520> fancy<00:02:34.030> and

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
some people like to get all fancy and

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:35.880 
some people like to get all fancy and
talk<00:02:34.330> about<00:02:34.450> the<00:02:34.780> central<00:02:35.260> nervous<00:02:35.320> system

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
talk about the central nervous system

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:38.370 
talk about the central nervous system
and<00:02:36.220> how<00:02:37.090> it<00:02:37.120> adapts<00:02:37.690> to<00:02:37.720> the<00:02:37.870> weights<00:02:38.080> but

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:38.380 
and how it adapts to the weights but

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:41.130 
and how it adapts to the weights but
basically<00:02:39.000> you're<00:02:40.000> handling<00:02:40.360> weights<00:02:40.630> in<00:02:40.870> a

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.140 
basically you're handling weights in a

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:43.860 
basically you're handling weights in a
shorter<00:02:41.500> distance<00:02:42.330> allowing<00:02:43.330> your<00:02:43.600> body<00:02:43.630> to

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
shorter distance allowing your body to

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:45.240 
shorter distance allowing your body to
handle<00:02:44.050> heavier<00:02:44.500> weights<00:02:44.740> and<00:02:45.010> your<00:02:45.130> body

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
handle heavier weights and your body

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:50.520 
handle heavier weights and your body
will<00:02:45.490> get<00:02:45.610> used<00:02:45.820> to<00:02:45.970> it<00:02:46.030> over<00:02:46.150> time<00:02:49.530> just

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
will get used to it over time just
