hey guys we just completed a day of

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:14.350 
hey guys we just completed a day of
recording<00:00:12.320> drums<00:00:12.590> all<00:00:13.130> day<00:00:13.460> just<00:00:13.910> getting<00:00:14.090> one

shots for this drum library and while

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:17.380 
shots for this drum library and while
we're<00:00:16.580> at<00:00:16.700> it<00:00:16.730> I'm<00:00:16.910> going<00:00:16.939> to<00:00:17.060> give<00:00:17.270> you<00:00:17.360> a

we're at it I'm going to give you a

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:19.420 
we're at it I'm going to give you a
little<00:00:17.750> quick<00:00:17.900> tutorial<00:00:18.500> on<00:00:18.770> how<00:00:18.830> to<00:00:19.189> put

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:19.430 
little quick tutorial on how to put

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:21.429 
little quick tutorial on how to put
together<00:00:19.520> some<00:00:20.300> really<00:00:20.360> great<00:00:20.720> drum<00:00:21.020> captures

00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:21.439 
together some really great drum captures

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:23.350 
together some really great drum captures
different<00:00:21.800> approaches<00:00:22.250> and<00:00:22.279> things<00:00:22.939> that<00:00:23.090> you

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:23.360 
different approaches and things that you

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:25.150 
different approaches and things that you
can<00:00:23.450> do<00:00:23.599> to<00:00:23.689> get<00:00:23.840> different<00:00:23.990> sounds<00:00:24.439> so<00:00:24.619> the

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:25.160 
can do to get different sounds so the

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:26.380 
can do to get different sounds so the
first<00:00:25.369> thing<00:00:25.520> I'm<00:00:25.610> going<00:00:25.730> to<00:00:25.790> show<00:00:25.880> you<00:00:25.970> is<00:00:26.360> a

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:26.390 
first thing I'm going to show you is a

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:28.510 
first thing I'm going to show you is a
couple<00:00:26.689> of<00:00:26.779> different<00:00:27.169> outside<00:00:27.520> mic

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:28.520 
couple of different outside mic

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:30.069 
couple of different outside mic
techniques<00:00:29.060> what's<00:00:29.419> important<00:00:29.779> to<00:00:29.840> know<00:00:29.960> is

00:00:30.069 --> 00:00:30.079 
techniques what's important to know is

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:31.990 
techniques what's important to know is
that<00:00:30.110> this<00:00:30.320> side<00:00:30.529> here<00:00:30.980> is<00:00:31.070> the<00:00:31.489> resonant<00:00:31.939> head

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:32.000 
that this side here is the resonant head

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.299 
that this side here is the resonant head
and<00:00:32.419> this<00:00:33.110> side<00:00:33.320> here<00:00:33.620> is<00:00:33.710> the<00:00:33.829> batter<00:00:34.040> head

00:00:34.299 --> 00:00:34.309 
and this side here is the batter head

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:35.950 
and this side here is the batter head
the<00:00:34.460> batter<00:00:34.640> head<00:00:34.850> is<00:00:35.000> where<00:00:35.149> the<00:00:35.360> drummer<00:00:35.780> is

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:35.960 
the batter head is where the drummer is

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.770 
the batter head is where the drummer is
going<00:00:36.110> to<00:00:36.170> be<00:00:36.320> playing<00:00:37.100> their<00:00:37.370> foot<00:00:37.550> pedal<00:00:37.820> so

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:38.780 
going to be playing their foot pedal so

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:40.060 
going to be playing their foot pedal so
this<00:00:38.930> is<00:00:39.020> where<00:00:39.170> the<00:00:39.260> attack<00:00:39.500> is<00:00:39.680> coming<00:00:39.800> from

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:40.070 
this is where the attack is coming from

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:41.530 
this is where the attack is coming from
this<00:00:40.280> is<00:00:40.340> where<00:00:40.610> the<00:00:40.700> tone<00:00:40.910> and<00:00:41.149> the<00:00:41.210> body<00:00:41.360> is

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:41.540 
this is where the tone and the body is

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:43.120 
this is where the tone and the body is
coming<00:00:41.750> from<00:00:41.960> so<00:00:42.620> when<00:00:42.740> you're<00:00:42.860> doing<00:00:43.040> an

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:43.130 
coming from so when you're doing an

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:44.950 
coming from so when you're doing an
outside<00:00:43.460> kick<00:00:43.730> mic<00:00:43.970> a<00:00:44.150> lot<00:00:44.330> of<00:00:44.450> the<00:00:44.510> times<00:00:44.720> what

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:44.960 
outside kick mic a lot of the times what

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:46.570 
outside kick mic a lot of the times what
you're<00:00:45.080> really<00:00:45.230> trying<00:00:45.500> to<00:00:45.620> capture<00:00:45.860> is<00:00:46.250> a

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:46.580 
you're really trying to capture is a

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:49.090 
you're really trying to capture is a
very<00:00:46.970> vivid<00:00:47.540> and<00:00:47.690> focused<00:00:48.350> image<00:00:48.650> of<00:00:48.800> the<00:00:48.920> low

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:49.100 
very vivid and focused image of the low

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:50.770 
very vivid and focused image of the low
end<00:00:49.130> to<00:00:49.550> the<00:00:49.730> tone<00:00:50.000> the<00:00:50.240> resonance<00:00:50.630> of<00:00:50.720> the

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:50.780 
end to the tone the resonance of the

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.200 
end to the tone the resonance of the
kick<00:00:51.020> so<00:00:51.560> here's<00:00:51.920> here's<00:00:52.490> a<00:00:52.640> quick<00:00:52.820> way<00:00:52.850> to<00:00:53.030> do

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:53.210 
kick so here's here's a quick way to do

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:57.850 
kick so here's here's a quick way to do
that<00:00:55.360> you<00:00:56.360> use<00:00:56.570> a<00:00:56.600> microphone<00:00:57.170> like<00:00:57.560> a<00:00:57.620> good

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:57.860 
that you use a microphone like a good

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:02.020 
that you use a microphone like a good
condenser<00:00:58.340> I<00:00:58.370> like<00:00:58.730> an<00:00:58.850> EM<00:00:58.970> 147<00:00:59.750> and<00:01:00.850> you<00:01:01.850> get

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:02.030 
condenser I like an EM 147 and you get

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:04.060 
condenser I like an EM 147 and you get
about<00:01:02.270> level<00:01:02.870> with<00:01:03.110> the<00:01:03.260> center<00:01:03.560> of<00:01:03.739> the<00:01:03.829> drum

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.070 
about level with the center of the drum

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:06.940 
about level with the center of the drum
and<00:01:04.720> it<00:01:05.720> takes<00:01:05.869> a<00:01:05.930> little<00:01:06.049> experiment<00:01:06.799> but<00:01:06.920> I

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:06.950 
and it takes a little experiment but I

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:09.550 
and it takes a little experiment but I
find<00:01:07.280> that<00:01:07.369> actually<00:01:08.090> pretty<00:01:08.360> far-out<00:01:08.659> it's

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:09.560 
find that actually pretty far-out it's

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.200 
find that actually pretty far-out it's
pretty<00:01:09.829> good<00:01:09.950> space<00:01:10.250> this<00:01:10.549> is<00:01:10.700> maybe<00:01:10.909> about

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210 
pretty good space this is maybe about

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.570 
pretty good space this is maybe about
two<00:01:11.479> feet<00:01:11.720> sometimes<00:01:12.530> even<00:01:12.829> further<00:01:13.040> but

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:13.580 
two feet sometimes even further but

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:15.100 
two feet sometimes even further but
usually<00:01:13.909> about<00:01:14.000> two<00:01:14.360> two-and-a-half<00:01:14.900> feet

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:15.110 
usually about two two-and-a-half feet

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:17.380 
usually about two two-and-a-half feet
out<00:01:15.560> from<00:01:15.620> the<00:01:16.190> drum<00:01:16.460> that's<00:01:17.000> where<00:01:17.270> you're

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:17.390 
out from the drum that's where you're

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.000 
out from the drum that's where you're
going<00:01:17.510> to<00:01:17.570> get<00:01:17.690> the<00:01:17.870> biggest<00:01:18.080> low-end<00:01:18.650> sound

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:19.010 
going to get the biggest low-end sound

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:21.340 
going to get the biggest low-end sound
now<00:01:19.520> when<00:01:19.700> you've<00:01:19.820> got<00:01:19.940> a<00:01:19.970> full<00:01:20.270> kit<00:01:20.540> in<00:01:20.750> a<00:01:20.960> lot

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.350 
now when you've got a full kit in a lot

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:22.750 
now when you've got a full kit in a lot
of<00:01:21.380> times<00:01:21.650> what<00:01:21.830> you<00:01:21.950> need<00:01:22.100> to<00:01:22.190> do<00:01:22.310> is<00:01:22.460> grab

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:22.760 
of times what you need to do is grab

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:24.850 
of times what you need to do is grab
moving<00:01:23.360> blankets<00:01:23.810> of<00:01:23.960> some<00:01:24.170> sort<00:01:24.440> packing

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:24.860 
moving blankets of some sort packing

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:28.450 
moving blankets of some sort packing
blankets<00:01:24.979> and<00:01:25.490> drape<00:01:26.200> over<00:01:27.200> the<00:01:27.229> kick<00:01:27.770> and<00:01:27.979> the

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:28.460 
blankets and drape over the kick and the

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:30.160 
blankets and drape over the kick and the
microphone<00:01:28.970> what<00:01:29.479> this<00:01:29.659> does<00:01:29.870> is<00:01:30.049> it

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:30.170 
microphone what this does is it

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.350 
microphone what this does is it
eliminates<00:01:30.350> the<00:01:30.920> the<00:01:31.370> cymbal<00:01:31.790> sound<00:01:32.060> from

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:32.360 
eliminates the the cymbal sound from

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.210 
eliminates the the cymbal sound from
getting<00:01:32.630> directly<00:01:32.960> into<00:01:33.320> the<00:01:33.409> mic<00:01:33.590> and<00:01:33.830> this

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:34.220 
getting directly into the mic and this

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.250 
getting directly into the mic and this
gives<00:01:34.430> you<00:01:34.520> just<00:01:34.729> a<00:01:34.940> focused<00:01:35.570> picture<00:01:36.020> of<00:01:36.140> the

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:36.260 
gives you just a focused picture of the

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.170 
gives you just a focused picture of the
low-end<00:01:36.590> it's<00:01:36.770> called<00:01:36.979> tunneling<00:01:37.430> so<00:01:38.000> that's

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:38.180 
low-end it's called tunneling so that's

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:40.539 
low-end it's called tunneling so that's
a<00:01:38.270> great<00:01:38.479> way<00:01:38.630> to<00:01:38.659> get<00:01:38.869> a<00:01:38.930> good<00:01:39.200> sub<00:01:39.770> out<00:01:40.040> of<00:01:40.310> out

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:40.549 
a great way to get a good sub out of out

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:43.090 
a great way to get a good sub out of out
of<00:01:40.790> a<00:01:40.850> kick<00:01:41.060> now<00:01:41.750> let's<00:01:41.990> say<00:01:42.140> that<00:01:42.380> you<00:01:42.710> want<00:01:43.040> to

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.100 
of a kick now let's say that you want to

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.030 
of a kick now let's say that you want to
get<00:01:43.340> more<00:01:43.700> smack<00:01:44.240> out<00:01:44.510> of<00:01:45.140> the<00:01:45.290> overall<00:01:45.740> sound

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:46.040 
get more smack out of the overall sound

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:48.700 
get more smack out of the overall sound
and<00:01:46.430> you<00:01:47.210> don't<00:01:47.450> mind<00:01:47.690> getting<00:01:48.049> the<00:01:48.260> cymbals

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:48.710 
and you don't mind getting the cymbals

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:50.560 
and you don't mind getting the cymbals
and<00:01:48.979> the<00:01:49.130> snare<00:01:49.400> into<00:01:49.790> the<00:01:49.880> sound<00:01:50.119> as<00:01:50.360> well

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:50.570 
and the snare into the sound as well

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:52.300 
and the snare into the sound as well
like<00:01:50.900> if<00:01:51.020> you're<00:01:51.140> doing<00:01:51.229> like<00:01:51.440> a<00:01:51.500> jazz<00:01:51.830> setup

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
like if you're doing like a jazz setup

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:53.320 
like if you're doing like a jazz setup
or<00:01:52.460> something<00:01:52.490> like<00:01:52.909> that

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:53.330 
or something like that

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:54.820 
or something like that
and<00:01:53.420> you're<00:01:53.720> using<00:01:53.900> a<00:01:54.049> minimal<00:01:54.439> mic<00:01:54.590> technique

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:54.830 
and you're using a minimal mic technique

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:57.940 
and you're using a minimal mic technique
instead<00:01:55.610> of<00:01:55.700> having<00:01:55.880> the<00:01:56.119> the<00:01:56.420> mic<00:01:56.600> here<00:01:57.020> you

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950 
instead of having the the mic here you

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:59.649 
instead of having the the mic here you
might<00:01:58.130> want<00:01:58.340> to<00:01:58.369> actually<00:01:58.549> raise<00:01:59.000> the<00:01:59.030> mic<00:01:59.450> up

00:01:59.649 --> 00:01:59.659 
might want to actually raise the mic up

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:03.670 
might want to actually raise the mic up
a<00:02:00.610> little<00:02:01.610> bit<00:02:01.729> higher<00:02:01.970> and<00:02:02.330> have<00:02:03.110> it<00:02:03.229> closer

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:03.680 
a little bit higher and have it closer

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.039 
a little bit higher and have it closer
to<00:02:03.860> the<00:02:04.010> kick<00:02:04.310> and<00:02:04.460> aimed<00:02:04.850> down<00:02:05.240> and<00:02:05.750> what's

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:06.049 
to the kick and aimed down and what's

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:07.480 
to the kick and aimed down and what's
going<00:02:06.200> to<00:02:06.229> happen<00:02:06.560> is<00:02:06.680> that<00:02:06.710> the<00:02:06.979> low<00:02:07.159> end<00:02:07.369> is

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490 
going to happen is that the low end is

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:09.639 
going to happen is that the low end is
going<00:02:07.580> to<00:02:07.640> come<00:02:07.850> off<00:02:08.000> axis<00:02:08.539> so<00:02:09.019> relative<00:02:09.530> to

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
going to come off axis so relative to

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:11.110 
going to come off axis so relative to
the<00:02:09.769> low<00:02:09.920> end<00:02:09.950> you're<00:02:10.489> actually<00:02:10.819> going<00:02:10.939> to<00:02:11.000> get

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
the low end you're actually going to get

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.330 
the low end you're actually going to get
more<00:02:11.360> smack<00:02:11.810> and<00:02:12.049> more<00:02:12.319> punch<00:02:12.620> from<00:02:12.980> the<00:02:13.099> tone

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
more smack and more punch from the tone

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.550 
more smack and more punch from the tone
this<00:02:13.760> is<00:02:13.939> a<00:02:13.970> really<00:02:14.269> good<00:02:14.450> technique<00:02:14.659> the<00:02:15.319> con

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
this is a really good technique the con

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.470 
this is a really good technique the con
of<00:02:15.590> it<00:02:15.860> is<00:02:15.980> that<00:02:16.189> you<00:02:16.430> can't<00:02:16.730> really<00:02:16.939> get<00:02:17.209> the

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
of it is that you can't really get the

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.110 
of it is that you can't really get the
cymbal<00:02:18.049> sound<00:02:18.319> and<00:02:18.590> snare<00:02:18.799> sound<00:02:19.099> out<00:02:19.340> but<00:02:19.939> if

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
cymbal sound and snare sound out but if

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:21.429 
cymbal sound and snare sound out but if
you<00:02:20.209> can<00:02:20.359> get<00:02:20.480> the<00:02:20.599> placement<00:02:21.049> just<00:02:21.079> right

00:02:21.429 --> 00:02:21.439 
you can get the placement just right

00:02:21.439 --> 00:02:22.800 
you can get the placement just right
where<00:02:21.650> it<00:02:21.769> sounds<00:02:21.950> good<00:02:22.279> for<00:02:22.549> all

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
where it sounds good for all

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:24.210 
where it sounds good for all
those<00:02:22.989> things<00:02:23.260> this<00:02:23.620> could<00:02:23.770> actually<00:02:23.890> be<00:02:24.099> a

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
those things this could actually be a

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.280 
those things this could actually be a
really<00:02:24.520> great<00:02:24.730> technique<00:02:25.000> now<00:02:25.900> of<00:02:26.020> course<00:02:26.230> a

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
really great technique now of course a

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.890 
really great technique now of course a
tried<00:02:26.530> and<00:02:26.560> true<00:02:26.800> rock<00:02:27.099> technique<00:02:27.690> for<00:02:28.690> like

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
tried and true rock technique for like

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.850 
tried and true rock technique for like
solid<00:02:29.500> punch<00:02:29.770> is<00:02:30.160> just<00:02:30.700> to<00:02:30.819> get<00:02:30.970> the<00:02:31.030> condenser

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
solid punch is just to get the condenser

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.500 
solid punch is just to get the condenser
real<00:02:32.860> close<00:02:33.220> right<00:02:33.730> up<00:02:33.910> against<00:02:34.270> the<00:02:34.360> head

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
real close right up against the head

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:36.839 
real close right up against the head
this<00:02:34.720> is<00:02:34.780> going<00:02:34.989> to<00:02:35.050> give<00:02:35.170> you<00:02:35.319> a<00:02:35.349> good<00:02:35.730> to<00:02:36.730> the

00:02:36.839 --> 00:02:36.849 
this is going to give you a good to the

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:38.520 
this is going to give you a good to the
tone<00:02:37.060> it's<00:02:37.270> going<00:02:37.390> to<00:02:37.450> be<00:02:37.540> shorter<00:02:37.870> decay<00:02:38.170> the

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
tone it's going to be shorter decay the

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:39.960 
tone it's going to be shorter decay the
low-end<00:02:38.860> isn't<00:02:39.130> going<00:02:39.250> to<00:02:39.310> extend<00:02:39.550> this<00:02:39.760> far

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
low-end isn't going to extend this far

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:41.160 
low-end isn't going to extend this far
but<00:02:40.390> it's<00:02:40.510> going<00:02:40.599> to<00:02:40.660> give<00:02:40.810> you<00:02:40.930> a<00:02:40.989> lot<00:02:41.140> of

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
but it's going to give you a lot of

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:42.479 
but it's going to give you a lot of
power<00:02:41.380> in<00:02:41.650> the<00:02:41.739> attack<00:02:42.010> that's<00:02:42.310> like<00:02:42.459> a

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:42.489 
power in the attack that's like a

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:45.720 
power in the attack that's like a
classic<00:02:43.090> rock<00:02:43.540> setup<00:02:44.130> all<00:02:45.130> right<00:02:45.280> so<00:02:45.489> what

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
classic rock setup all right so what

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.820 
classic rock setup all right so what
else<00:02:45.760> can<00:02:46.030> you<00:02:46.120> do<00:02:46.269> well<00:02:46.540> let's<00:02:47.380> say<00:02:47.530> that<00:02:47.739> you

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830 
else can you do well let's say that you

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:49.680 
else can you do well let's say that you
want<00:02:48.040> to<00:02:48.069> get<00:02:48.250> the<00:02:48.489> shell<00:02:48.849> tone<00:02:49.120> that's<00:02:49.420> sort

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
want to get the shell tone that's sort

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:51.960 
want to get the shell tone that's sort
of<00:02:49.750> mid-range<00:02:50.110> II<00:02:50.650> I<00:02:50.920> don't<00:02:51.430> want<00:02:51.790> to<00:02:51.849> say

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
of mid-range II I don't want to say

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:53.520 
of mid-range II I don't want to say
clanky<00:02:52.420> because<00:02:52.630> that<00:02:52.750> makes<00:02:52.870> it<00:02:52.989> sound<00:02:53.170> bad

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
clanky because that makes it sound bad

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:55.800 
clanky because that makes it sound bad
but<00:02:53.800> sort<00:02:54.099> of<00:02:54.190> that<00:02:54.430> like<00:02:54.700> I<00:02:55.030> don't<00:02:55.450> know<00:02:55.600> Jeb

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
but sort of that like I don't know Jeb

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:57.150 
but sort of that like I don't know Jeb
how<00:02:55.930> would<00:02:56.049> you<00:02:56.140> describe<00:02:56.380> the<00:02:56.739> sound<00:02:56.980> that

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.160 
how would you describe the sound that

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.220 
how would you describe the sound that
you<00:02:57.310> get<00:02:57.459> when<00:02:57.610> you<00:02:57.700> put<00:02:57.850> the<00:02:58.000> mic<00:02:58.450> inside<00:02:58.930> and

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
you get when you put the mic inside and

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:02.550 
you get when you put the mic inside and
aimed<00:02:59.890> at<00:03:00.010> the<00:03:00.069> shell<00:03:00.400> I<00:03:01.110> think<00:03:02.110> it's<00:03:02.260> a<00:03:02.380> very

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
aimed at the shell I think it's a very

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.300 
aimed at the shell I think it's a very
residential<00:03:04.470> shell<00:03:05.470> say<00:03:05.680> on<00:03:05.799> the<00:03:05.920> timbre<00:03:06.220> of

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
residential shell say on the timbre of

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:08.580 
residential shell say on the timbre of
the<00:03:06.400> drum<00:03:06.640> yeah<00:03:07.420> so<00:03:07.900> okay<00:03:07.930> so<00:03:08.319> that's

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
the drum yeah so okay so that's

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:09.809 
the drum yeah so okay so that's
basically<00:03:08.650> what<00:03:09.099> it<00:03:09.190> is<00:03:09.220> it's<00:03:09.459> the<00:03:09.580> shell

00:03:09.809 --> 00:03:09.819 
basically what it is it's the shell

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:11.370 
basically what it is it's the shell
sound<00:03:10.090> so<00:03:10.480> what<00:03:10.599> you're<00:03:10.720> going<00:03:10.870> to<00:03:10.900> do<00:03:11.080> is

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:11.380 
sound so what you're going to do is

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:13.860 
sound so what you're going to do is
you're<00:03:11.620> going<00:03:11.650> to<00:03:11.860> take<00:03:12.160> the<00:03:12.340> D<00:03:13.180> 112<00:03:13.599> or

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:13.870 
you're going to take the D 112 or

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:15.270 
you're going to take the D 112 or
something<00:03:14.230> similar<00:03:14.620> a<00:03:14.650> large<00:03:14.950> diaphragm

those flavors now another way that you

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.470 
those flavors now another way that you
can<00:03:41.350> approach<00:03:41.470> miking<00:03:42.220> a<00:03:42.430> kick<00:03:42.910> drum<00:03:42.940> is<00:03:43.329> to

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 
can approach miking a kick drum is to

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.830 
can approach miking a kick drum is to
actually<00:03:43.630> mic<00:03:44.170> both<00:03:44.829> the<00:03:45.190> outside<00:03:45.340> and<00:03:45.970> the

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840 
actually mic both the outside and the

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.240 
actually mic both the outside and the
batter<00:03:47.079> head<00:03:47.440> which<00:03:47.680> is<00:03:47.829> going<00:03:47.920> to<00:03:47.980> give<00:03:48.130> you

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.250 
batter head which is going to give you

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:49.800 
batter head which is going to give you
an<00:03:48.370> attack<00:03:48.670> so<00:03:49.269> there's<00:03:49.450> a<00:03:49.480> couple<00:03:49.600> of<00:03:49.750> ways

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.810 
an attack so there's a couple of ways

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:51.569 
an attack so there's a couple of ways
you<00:03:49.870> can<00:03:50.079> do<00:03:50.230> that<00:03:50.440> one<00:03:50.709> way<00:03:50.859> you<00:03:50.920> can<00:03:51.160> do<00:03:51.280> it<00:03:51.310> is

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:51.579 
you can do that one way you can do it is

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:54.300 
you can do that one way you can do it is
you<00:03:51.700> can<00:03:51.850> take<00:03:52.030> your<00:03:52.180> D<00:03:52.359> 112<00:03:52.810> and<00:03:53.190> point<00:03:54.190> it

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.310 
you can take your D 112 and point it

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:56.970 
you can take your D 112 and point it
forward<00:03:54.730> or<00:03:54.910> even<00:03:54.970> an<00:03:55.269> sm57<00:03:55.720> if<00:03:56.440> you<00:03:56.530> want<00:03:56.739> and

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:56.980 
forward or even an sm57 if you want and

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:59.280 
forward or even an sm57 if you want and
go<00:03:57.250> all<00:03:57.519> the<00:03:57.549> way<00:03:57.850> inside<00:03:58.209> the<00:03:58.269> kick<00:03:58.569> right

00:03:59.280 --> 00:03:59.290 
go all the way inside the kick right

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:00.870 
go all the way inside the kick right
near<00:03:59.500> the<00:03:59.620> batter<00:03:59.799> head<00:04:00.130> and<00:04:00.400> that's<00:04:00.670> going<00:04:00.819> to

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:00.880 
near the batter head and that's going to

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:02.910 
near the batter head and that's going to
give<00:04:01.030> you<00:04:01.120> a<00:04:01.209> very<00:04:01.569> cliquey<00:04:01.989> punchy<00:04:02.590> attack

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:02.920 
give you a very cliquey punchy attack

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:05.729 
give you a very cliquey punchy attack
very<00:04:03.579> short<00:04:04.120> duration<00:04:04.299> that's<00:04:05.230> really<00:04:05.530> good

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:05.739 
very short duration that's really good

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:07.770 
very short duration that's really good
for<00:04:06.040> things<00:04:06.190> like<00:04:06.489> metal<00:04:06.940> records<00:04:07.299> anything

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:07.780 
for things like metal records anything

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:09.240 
for things like metal records anything
where<00:04:07.900> the<00:04:07.989> kick<00:04:08.139> drum<00:04:08.350> is<00:04:08.380> going<00:04:08.620> to<00:04:08.680> be<00:04:08.799> like

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:09.250 
where the kick drum is going to be like

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:12.390 
where the kick drum is going to be like
hitting<00:04:09.459> very<00:04:09.819> quickly<00:04:10.920> another<00:04:11.920> way<00:04:12.130> to<00:04:12.190> do

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:12.400 
hitting very quickly another way to do

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.490 
hitting very quickly another way to do
it<00:04:12.519> is<00:04:12.670> to<00:04:13.239> actually<00:04:13.389> go<00:04:13.780> around<00:04:13.900> the<00:04:14.380> other

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:14.500 
it is to actually go around the other

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:22.560 
it is to actually go around the other
side<00:04:14.650> and<00:04:18.600> like<00:04:19.600> this<00:04:20.500> side<00:04:20.799> of<00:04:21.010> the<00:04:21.130> kick<00:04:21.570> so

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:22.570 
side and like this side of the kick so

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:23.909 
side and like this side of the kick so
when<00:04:22.750> you're<00:04:22.870> making<00:04:23.050> up<00:04:23.289> that<00:04:23.410> side<00:04:23.680> of<00:04:23.830> the

00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:23.919 
when you're making up that side of the

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:25.680 
when you're making up that side of the
kick<00:04:24.130> the<00:04:24.550> one<00:04:24.760> thing<00:04:24.970> you<00:04:25.060> have<00:04:25.240> to<00:04:25.270> remember

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:25.690 
kick the one thing you have to remember

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:27.750 
kick the one thing you have to remember
is<00:04:25.990> that<00:04:26.020> you<00:04:26.500> have<00:04:26.680> a<00:04:26.710> phase<00:04:27.100> thing<00:04:27.550> to

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:27.760 
is that you have a phase thing to

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:30.090 
is that you have a phase thing to
consider<00:04:27.940> now<00:04:28.360> that<00:04:29.200> the<00:04:29.350> distance<00:04:29.830> between

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:30.100 
consider now that the distance between

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:32.940 
consider now that the distance between
the<00:04:30.639> resonant<00:04:31.120> head<00:04:31.180> and<00:04:31.630> where<00:04:32.200> you've<00:04:32.440> the

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:32.950 
the resonant head and where you've the

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:36.060 
the resonant head and where you've the
batter<00:04:33.220> side<00:04:33.580> should<00:04:34.360> be<00:04:34.419> equivalent<00:04:35.289> to<00:04:35.919> how

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:36.070 
batter side should be equivalent to how

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:36.870 
batter side should be equivalent to how
far<00:04:36.370> any

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:36.880 
far any

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:38.220 
far any
outside<00:04:37.150> kick<00:04:37.390> is<00:04:37.510> going<00:04:37.660> to<00:04:37.720> be<00:04:37.840> so<00:04:38.050> once

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:38.230 
outside kick is going to be so once

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:39.780 
outside kick is going to be so once
again<00:04:38.380> we're<00:04:38.620> going<00:04:38.740> back<00:04:38.860> to<00:04:39.160> this<00:04:39.310> idea<00:04:39.520> of

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:39.790 
again we're going back to this idea of

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:41.850 
again we're going back to this idea of
having<00:04:40.000> to<00:04:40.270> kick<00:04:40.450> out<00:04:40.630> like<00:04:40.990> actually<00:04:41.590> fairly

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:41.860 
having to kick out like actually fairly

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:44.280 
having to kick out like actually fairly
far<00:04:42.220> from<00:04:42.490> the<00:04:42.610> drum<00:04:42.820> the<00:04:43.600> important<00:04:44.020> thing<00:04:44.140> is

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:44.290 
far from the drum the important thing is

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:47.040 
far from the drum the important thing is
is<00:04:44.410> that<00:04:44.620> this<00:04:45.220> is<00:04:45.430> your<00:04:45.580> low<00:04:45.820> ends<00:04:46.270> this<00:04:46.540> this

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:47.050 
is that this is your low ends this this

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:49.680 
is that this is your low ends this this
side<00:04:47.560> here<00:04:47.980> is<00:04:48.010> going<00:04:48.190> to<00:04:48.250> give<00:04:48.430> you<00:04:48.550> the<00:04:48.790> boom

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:49.690 
side here is going to give you the boom

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:52.530 
side here is going to give you the boom
the<00:04:50.260> the<00:04:50.680> punch<00:04:50.950> and<00:04:51.280> the<00:04:51.430> the<00:04:51.790> thickness<00:04:52.390> of

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:52.540 
the the punch and the the thickness of

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:55.080 
the the punch and the the thickness of
it<00:04:52.660> that's<00:04:53.290> what<00:04:53.590> needs<00:04:53.800> to<00:04:53.920> be<00:04:54.070> in<00:04:54.190> phase<00:04:54.490> the

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:55.090 
it that's what needs to be in phase the

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:57.240 
it that's what needs to be in phase the
attack<00:04:55.450> it's<00:04:55.870> such<00:04:56.110> a<00:04:56.140> short<00:04:56.380> duration<00:04:56.590> that

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:57.250 
attack it's such a short duration that

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:59.370 
attack it's such a short duration that
the<00:04:57.580> phase<00:04:57.910> issues<00:04:58.300> are<00:04:58.450> going<00:04:58.570> to<00:04:58.690> be<00:04:58.750> fairly

00:04:59.370 --> 00:04:59.380 
the phase issues are going to be fairly

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:00.870 
the phase issues are going to be fairly
minimal<00:04:59.650> and<00:05:00.040> not<00:05:00.070> something<00:05:00.520> you<00:05:00.700> need<00:05:00.820> to

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:00.880 
minimal and not something you need to

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:02.010 
minimal and not something you need to
terribly<00:05:01.360> worry<00:05:01.540> about

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:02.020 
terribly worry about

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:04.350 
terribly worry about
so<00:05:02.350> remember<00:05:02.770> it's<00:05:02.890> not<00:05:03.010> the<00:05:03.220> distance<00:05:03.730> from

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:04.360 
so remember it's not the distance from

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:06.330 
so remember it's not the distance from
the<00:05:04.540> batter<00:05:04.840> head<00:05:05.170> to<00:05:05.350> that<00:05:05.530> mic<00:05:05.800> being<00:05:06.190> the

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:06.340 
the batter head to that mic being the

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:08.610 
the batter head to that mic being the
same<00:05:06.580> as<00:05:06.850> the<00:05:07.480> resonant<00:05:07.900> head<00:05:07.960> to<00:05:08.200> this<00:05:08.380> mic

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:08.620 
same as the resonant head to this mic

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:10.410 
same as the resonant head to this mic
it's<00:05:09.190> actually<00:05:09.640> the<00:05:09.760> distance<00:05:09.940> from<00:05:10.240> the

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:10.420 
it's actually the distance from the

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:14.190 
it's actually the distance from the
resonant<00:05:10.930> head<00:05:10.960> to<00:05:11.470> the<00:05:11.680> batter<00:05:11.890> head<00:05:13.200> out

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:14.200 
resonant head to the batter head out

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:15.770 
resonant head to the batter head out
that<00:05:15.160> makes<00:05:15.370> sense

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:15.780 
that makes sense

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:18.030 
that makes sense
all<00:05:16.780> right<00:05:16.900> cool<00:05:17.140> so<00:05:17.410> that's<00:05:17.620> a<00:05:17.710> couple<00:05:17.860> of

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:18.040 
all right cool so that's a couple of

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:20.790 
all right cool so that's a couple of
ways<00:05:18.160> you<00:05:18.310> can<00:05:18.400> make<00:05:18.550> a<00:05:18.580> kick<00:05:18.820> drum<00:05:19.170> hope<00:05:20.170> hope

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:20.800 
ways you can make a kick drum hope hope

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:29.040 
ways you can make a kick drum hope hope
you<00:05:20.920> learned<00:05:21.070> something

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:29.050 

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:31.110
