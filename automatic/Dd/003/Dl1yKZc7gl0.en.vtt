 I'm going to show you how to prepare 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:32.239
 delicious basic spaghetti because they are 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:33.739
 basic because I teach you how to 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:36.019
 prepare them and then you can 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:37.579
 add the sauce to the ingredients that 

00:00:36.019 --> 00:00:40.519
 I just want to show you 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:42.889
 how to cook them and the rest is your 

00:00:40.519 --> 00:00:44.409
 imagination the limit is the sky like this 

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:47.420
 that you can add whatever you want 

00:00:44.409 --> 00:00:50.030
 sausages meat and vegetables what you 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:52.670
 you can sautÃ© with oil 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:54.859
 olive with butter and you can 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:57.850
 accompany your cheese I prefer 

00:00:54.859 --> 00:01:02.160
 I'm going to prepare them with Parmesan cheese 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:05.129
 and that his spot so stay 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.630
 in a large pot we put water to boil 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:10.570
 with a spoonful of salt 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:13.110
 We pack a spaghetti packet 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.110
 half 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:19.150
 and we add it to our boiling water 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:23.040
 that we previously put a spoonful 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:25.590
 salt soup and a spoonful of oil 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:28.560
 it can be olive oil coconut oil 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:31.620
 or butter what you decide the 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:35.730
 we stir little by little until 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:37.650
 We see the video or spaghetti 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:40.950
 they are putting much more soft 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:44.479
 can be cooked for 10 to 15 minutes or 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.479
 consistency that you like 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:52.440
 we take out a noodle we put it on a table 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:55.050
 if the center comes out white 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:56.850
 is that you still lack cooking if you no longer 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:59.880
 you see a little white dot like in this 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:03.030
 is that it is fully cooked and already 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.490
 is ready to eat if it is crossed 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.470
 I would see a little white dot in the center 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:10.740
 then we're going to take it out and we're going to 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:11.940
 drain in a pasta drainer there is 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:14.010
 to be very careful because we 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.739
 we went to burn with the water 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:20.220
 in a pan or in a pot we are going to 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:22.140
 put butter oil olive oil 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.780
 of coconut what you decide for 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.700
 skip their relatives in this case like 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.239
 it's for my children I decided to do it with a 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.239
 little butter 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.300
 at medium heat 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:42.709
 when I make butter 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:45.080
 we incorporate the spaghetti with the help 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:47.690
 from a spoon a fork what you 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:52.209
 decide what they can move 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:52.209
 Skip our records and you're done 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:58.060
 we put on a plate and add them 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:02.290
 the cheese that you want can you 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:04.630

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:12.210

 give a little salt to the spaghetti 

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:18.180
