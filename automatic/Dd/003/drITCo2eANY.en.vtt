 calculation in catering and 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:31.760
 find actually and retell compilation 

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:33.800
 you can read it yourself but read because 

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:38.390
 that when reading nothing will be clear 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:41.510
 and I will learn how to die a dish just 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:43.540
 it is clear this gradually we will work 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:46.760
 understand all subtleties above the dish 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:53.809
 costing gradually expose all 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:55.960
 techniques and all the tables and the homelands of the book in 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:59.410
 Mostly these lessons are intended for 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:04.220
 beginner businessmen beginners 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:05.930
 catering working because 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:07.940
 what if the enterprise is public 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:11.030
 food works in the labor market is equal to 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:14.000
 already for many, many years of course already 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:16.369
 they work professionally they are and 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.340
 colder accountants regulators and on 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:21.170
 free all programs by programmers 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:26.240
 expensive you can buy the program 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:31.970
 what is there suck issue 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:34.880
 and take a walk and technology but actually 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:40.220
 every entrepreneur wants to know himself 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:42.520
 how to make such products go from what 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:49.330
 is the price 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:54.070
 how to calculate which tables are valid 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:54.070
 to be calculated on them could 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:02:01.600
 we fix potatoes 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:04.940
 the tables just in front of me are 25 compilations 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:07.310
 input calculation diverge i exit bad 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:10.369
 household dictator of development 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:13.070
 I write a collection of all that visually 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:18.830
 show what is valid if in costing 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:21.920
 take good that's it this is what 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:25.340
 on September 1, mainly the cost estimate view 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:29.590
 on September 1, it is written there first 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:33.110
 taken 133 let's say this is uncleaned 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:33.970
 it turns out with growth and if we take 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:37.040
 February 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:40.880
 let's say January to February are already ancient 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:43.520
 that 33 is so 24 on the table and therefore in 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:49.060
 costing it need you still do that 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:52.390
 there is no longer taking 130 to 150 490 and 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:55.810
 completed village 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:57.910
 and in September how to do it 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:00.610
 I still need to do everything 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:04.240
 telling hands of course I will rule 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:06.330
 Lyceum program lessons here are very 

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:07.690
 it is convenient to calculate 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:11.380
 soup 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:14.380
 burn compilations how they look there take 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:16.450
 on of 2 columns gross net category 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:19.090
 first category 2 3 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:20.950
 these are different categories this is exchange 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:23.560
 evaluation category it was already on 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:26.800
 the station is about this what is this restaurant 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:29.830
 and here comes a very full full grown 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:32.380
 the dish is more expensive here 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:35.470
 let's say to the flash drive all sorts of yes 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:39.670
 already a little cheaper and the third time she 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:43.450
 generally give for those who he 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:47.590
 who earn less so that it is 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:50.680
 cheaper the same was delicious too this 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:53.739
 It was all said but all the tables 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:55.030
 let's say i say about the table not only 

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:58.230
 vegetables 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:04:01.080
 but it's like astronomical goods 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:03.520
 the table will be in the face 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:06.400
 interchangeability of products like her 

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:13.750
 will act on costing it 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:16.109
 also need to say what else we will 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:20.260
 compete the dish 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:23.979
 regulate i will talk about 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:26.229
 replace tomato with tomato paste and fat 

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:32.650
 I'll be on the store too 

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:36.550
 telling it is done the same lessons in 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:41.280
 first let's say I talk about bills 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:47.200
 drilled I will give not only 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:49.979
 footage but i will make a tab to 

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:49.979
 could read 

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:58.740
 someone likes to study and someone doesn't 

00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:05.979
 perceive by ear and it is easier for him 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:19.140
 read and also lessons your investments not 

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:19.140
 only costing you yourself 

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:32.919
 learn to work with a collection of recipes 

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:35.370
 come to my to my blog and be with 

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:35.370
 communicate with you 

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:38.810
 I myself
