hi<00:00:05.190> guys<00:00:05.430> this<00:00:05.730> is<00:00:06.149> a<00:00:06.180> short<00:00:06.660> video<00:00:06.810> just<00:00:07.380> to

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529 
hi guys this is a short video just to

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:10.700 
hi guys this is a short video just to
speak<00:00:07.830> really<00:00:08.400> quickly<00:00:08.670> about<00:00:09.260> the<00:00:10.260> concept<00:00:10.650> I

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
speak really quickly about the concept I

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.619 
speak really quickly about the concept I
have<00:00:10.740> for<00:00:11.190> duplicating<00:00:11.760> some<00:00:11.910> of<00:00:12.030> the<00:00:12.090> ms-20

00:00:12.619 --> 00:00:12.629 
have for duplicating some of the ms-20

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:15.230 
have for duplicating some of the ms-20
circuits<00:00:13.020> as<00:00:13.860> many<00:00:14.340> of<00:00:14.459> you<00:00:14.549> know<00:00:14.580> some<00:00:15.030> of<00:00:15.059> you

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
circuits as many of you know some of you

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.240 
circuits as many of you know some of you
have<00:00:15.270> the<00:00:15.480> ms-20<00:00:15.959> some<00:00:16.110> of<00:00:16.230> you<00:00:16.320> don't<00:00:16.500> it's<00:00:17.039> a

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
have the ms-20 some of you don't it's a

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.340 
have the ms-20 some of you don't it's a
it's<00:00:17.430> a<00:00:17.520> pretty<00:00:17.670> versatile<00:00:18.119> synthesizer<00:00:18.660> but

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
it's a pretty versatile synthesizer but

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:20.500 
it's a pretty versatile synthesizer but
what<00:00:19.500> really<00:00:19.650> sets<00:00:19.890> it<00:00:20.070> apart<00:00:20.160> from

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:20.510 
what really sets it apart from

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:22.610 
what really sets it apart from
traditional<00:00:21.510> old-school<00:00:21.780> synthesizers<00:00:22.440> is

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:22.620 
traditional old-school synthesizers is

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:24.790 
traditional old-school synthesizers is
patch<00:00:22.950> section<00:00:23.520> where<00:00:24.240> you've<00:00:24.450> got<00:00:24.660> a

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:24.800 
patch section where you've got a

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.220 
patch section where you've got a
modulation<00:00:25.800> generator<00:00:26.420> that<00:00:27.420> is<00:00:27.690> basically

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
modulation generator that is basically

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.859 
modulation generator that is basically
the<00:00:28.650> out<00:00:28.830> of<00:00:29.250> the<00:00:29.880> one<00:00:30.060> that's<00:00:30.240> built<00:00:30.390> in<00:00:30.600> here

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
the out of the one that's built in here

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.600 
the out of the one that's built in here
on<00:00:30.990> the<00:00:31.080> panel<00:00:31.289> you've<00:00:31.920> got<00:00:32.070> a<00:00:32.099> separate

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
on the panel you've got a separate

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:33.950 
on the panel you've got a separate
sample<00:00:33.000> and<00:00:33.090> hold<00:00:33.210> that<00:00:33.390> you<00:00:33.510> can<00:00:33.629> completely

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
sample and hold that you can completely

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.740 
sample and hold that you can completely
patch<00:00:34.230> in<00:00:34.550> and<00:00:35.550> you've<00:00:35.640> got<00:00:35.789> a<00:00:35.820> VCA<00:00:36.239> and<00:00:36.630> that's

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
patch in and you've got a VCA and that's

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:37.790 
patch in and you've got a VCA and that's
what<00:00:36.870> I'm<00:00:36.960> going<00:00:37.050> to<00:00:37.110> be<00:00:37.200> demonstrating<00:00:37.320> in

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
what I'm going to be demonstrating in

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.260 
what I'm going to be demonstrating in
this<00:00:37.920> video<00:00:38.160> and<00:00:38.670> you've<00:00:38.760> also<00:00:38.910> got<00:00:39.060> a<00:00:39.090> noise

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
this video and you've also got a noise

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:40.910 
this video and you've also got a noise
generator<00:00:39.750> that<00:00:39.930> you<00:00:40.020> have<00:00:40.200> to<00:00:40.320> patch<00:00:40.560> into

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
generator that you have to patch into

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.040 
generator that you have to patch into
the<00:00:41.100> synth<00:00:41.370> if<00:00:41.940> you<00:00:42.120> want<00:00:42.300> to<00:00:42.390> hear<00:00:42.660> it<00:00:42.750> in<00:00:42.780> any

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
the synth if you want to hear it in any

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.900 
the synth if you want to hear it in any
of<00:00:43.200> your<00:00:43.260> patches<00:00:43.500> so<00:00:44.280> today<00:00:44.610> we're<00:00:44.730> going<00:00:44.820> to

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
of your patches so today we're going to

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.000 
of your patches so today we're going to
talk<00:00:45.030> about<00:00:45.060> the<00:00:45.329> VCA<00:00:45.660> this<00:00:46.020> separate<00:00:46.590> VCA<00:00:46.920> is

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
talk about the VCA this separate VCA is

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.200 
talk about the VCA this separate VCA is
something<00:00:47.430> I'm<00:00:47.550> thinking<00:00:47.579> about<00:00:47.820> doing<00:00:48.030> a

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
something I'm thinking about doing a

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.840 
something I'm thinking about doing a
circuit<00:00:48.480> board<00:00:48.600> for<00:00:48.870> it'll<00:00:49.860> be<00:00:49.980> very<00:00:50.309> simple

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
circuit board for it'll be very simple

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.960 
circuit board for it'll be very simple
with<00:00:51.390> an<00:00:51.870> in<00:00:52.110> and<00:00:52.260> out<00:00:52.470> for<00:00:53.070> the<00:00:53.130> audio<00:00:53.489> as<00:00:53.910> well

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:53.970 
with an in and out for the audio as well

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:56.299 
with an in and out for the audio as well
as<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:54.510> CV<00:00:54.840> input<00:00:55.230> with<00:00:55.380> a<00:00:55.410> volume<00:00:55.680> pot<00:00:56.010> one

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
as the CV input with a volume pot one

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.330 
as the CV input with a volume pot one
pot<00:00:56.520> basically<00:00:57.200> to<00:00:58.200> control<00:00:58.530> the<00:00:58.770> amount<00:00:59.219> of

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
pot basically to control the amount of

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.520 
pot basically to control the amount of
CV<00:00:59.670> you're<00:00:59.880> sending<00:01:00.180> into<00:01:00.329> it<00:01:00.510> now<00:01:01.140> this<00:01:01.350> is<00:01:01.500> a

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
CV you're sending into it now this is a

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.830 
CV you're sending into it now this is a
VAT<00:01:01.800> all<00:01:02.100> based<00:01:02.520> VCA<00:01:03.030> and<00:01:03.360> that's<00:01:03.480> really<00:01:03.719> what

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
VAT all based VCA and that's really what

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.289 
VAT all based VCA and that's really what
I<00:01:03.870> wanted<00:01:04.140> to<00:01:04.229> demonstrate<00:01:04.379> here<00:01:04.860> because<00:01:05.299> in

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
I wanted to demonstrate here because in

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.239 
I wanted to demonstrate here because in
the<00:01:06.540> design<00:01:06.869> I<00:01:06.899> really<00:01:07.409> planned<00:01:07.649> to<00:01:07.799> duplicate

00:01:08.239 --> 00:01:08.249 
the design I really planned to duplicate

00:01:08.249 --> 00:01:09.739 
the design I really planned to duplicate
it<00:01:08.369> exactly<00:01:08.909> as<00:01:09.060> it<00:01:09.240> is<00:01:09.270> in<00:01:09.569> the<00:01:09.630> original

00:01:09.739 --> 00:01:09.749 
it exactly as it is in the original

00:01:09.749 --> 00:01:11.929 
it exactly as it is in the original
ms-20<00:01:10.560> and<00:01:10.829> that<00:01:11.100> includes<00:01:11.429> a<00:01:11.549> little<00:01:11.670> bit<00:01:11.850> of

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
ms-20 and that includes a little bit of

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:16.219 
ms-20 and that includes a little bit of
bleed<00:01:12.149> through<00:01:14.299> for<00:01:15.299> the<00:01:15.389> for<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:15.899> signal

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
bleed through for the for the signal

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:17.899 
bleed through for the for the signal
it's<00:01:16.709> probably<00:01:17.100> going<00:01:17.219> to<00:01:17.280> be<00:01:17.369> really<00:01:17.579> hard<00:01:17.759> to

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
it's probably going to be really hard to

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.330 
it's probably going to be really hard to
hear<00:01:18.329> here<00:01:18.600> on<00:01:18.719> iphone<00:01:19.200> video<00:01:19.380> but<00:01:19.829> let<00:01:20.279> me

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
hear here on iphone video but let me

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:21.769 
hear here on iphone video but let me
give<00:01:20.490> it<00:01:20.579> a<00:01:20.609> shot<00:01:20.819> I'm<00:01:21.299> gonna<00:01:21.420> go<00:01:21.569> ahead<00:01:21.659> and

00:01:21.769 --> 00:01:21.779 
give it a shot I'm gonna go ahead and

00:01:21.779 --> 00:01:24.980 
give it a shot I'm gonna go ahead and
down<00:01:22.380> here<00:01:22.529> on<00:01:22.619> my<00:01:22.649> axis<00:01:23.009> virus<00:01:23.369> press<00:01:24.329> a<00:01:24.359> key

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
down here on my axis virus press a key

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.059 
down here on my axis virus press a key
and<00:01:26.509> let<00:01:27.509> me<00:01:27.569> try<00:01:27.719> and<00:01:27.779> put<00:01:27.959> the<00:01:28.109> mic<00:01:28.679> up<00:01:28.859> to<00:01:28.979> the

00:01:29.059 --> 00:01:29.069 
and let me try and put the mic up to the

00:01:29.069 --> 00:01:31.760 
and let me try and put the mic up to the
speaker<00:01:30.109> here<00:01:31.109> there's<00:01:31.319> a<00:01:31.380> little<00:01:31.560> bit<00:01:31.649> of

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
speaker here there's a little bit of

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.550 
speaker here there's a little bit of
belief<00:01:31.979> you're<00:01:32.130> going<00:01:32.340> on<00:01:32.429> right<00:01:32.609> now<00:01:33.560> maybe

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
belief you're going on right now maybe

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.279 
belief you're going on right now maybe
maybe<00:01:34.920> you<00:01:35.039> can't<00:01:35.219> hear<00:01:35.340> that<00:01:35.369> on<00:01:35.609> youtube<00:01:35.939> but

00:01:36.279 --> 00:01:36.289 
maybe you can't hear that on youtube but

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:38.719 
maybe you can't hear that on youtube but
let<00:01:37.289> me<00:01:37.380> show<00:01:37.770> you<00:01:37.829> the<00:01:38.009> natural<00:01:38.399> decay<00:01:38.700> of

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
let me show you the natural decay of

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:45.289 
let me show you the natural decay of
this<00:01:38.999> sound<00:01:39.240> here<00:01:43.700> now<00:01:44.700> this<00:01:44.819> is<00:01:44.880> just<00:01:45.119> a

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
this sound here now this is just a

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.870 
this sound here now this is just a
straight<00:01:45.569> gate<00:01:45.810> signal<00:01:46.319> going<00:01:47.039> to<00:01:47.159> the<00:01:47.429> VCA<00:01:47.759> so

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
straight gate signal going to the VCA so

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.279 
straight gate signal going to the VCA so
you<00:01:48.149> hear<00:01:48.389> a<00:01:48.419> little<00:01:48.599> bit<00:01:48.779> of<00:01:48.899> fade-out

00:01:49.279 --> 00:01:49.289 
you hear a little bit of fade-out

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:53.539 
you hear a little bit of fade-out
because<00:01:49.740> of<00:01:49.889> the<00:01:49.979> backdrop<00:01:52.159> but<00:01:53.159> really<00:01:53.429> the

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
because of the backdrop but really the

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.699 
because of the backdrop but really the
best<00:01:53.729> way<00:01:53.939> to<00:01:53.969> demonstrate<00:01:54.179> this<00:01:54.689> is<00:01:54.749> to<00:01:55.020> to

00:01:55.699 --> 00:01:55.709 
best way to demonstrate this is to to

00:01:55.709 --> 00:01:57.379 
best way to demonstrate this is to to
get<00:01:55.859> a<00:01:55.889> sequence<00:01:56.279> going<00:01:56.669> so<00:01:56.849> I<00:01:56.880> have<00:01:57.029> my<00:01:57.149> Fat

00:01:57.379 --> 00:01:57.389 
get a sequence going so I have my Fat

00:01:57.389 --> 00:01:59.800 
get a sequence going so I have my Fat
Controller<00:01:57.569> and<00:01:58.200> I'm<00:01:58.770> going<00:01:58.889> to<00:01:58.950> plug<00:01:59.159> the

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 
Controller and I'm going to plug the

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.539 
Controller and I'm going to plug the
gate<00:02:00.810> out<00:02:01.079> of<00:02:01.409> the<00:02:01.560> Fat<00:02:01.709> Controller<00:02:01.859> into<00:02:02.459> the

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
gate out of the Fat Controller into the

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.609 
gate out of the Fat Controller into the
control<00:02:02.880> input<00:02:03.239> obviously<00:02:03.929> with<00:02:04.289> the<00:02:04.349> control

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
control input obviously with the control

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.739 
control input obviously with the control
input<00:02:04.859> from<00:02:04.979> VGA<00:02:05.310> you<00:02:05.369> could<00:02:05.609> use<00:02:05.759> an<00:02:05.909> adsr<00:02:06.509> but

00:02:06.739 --> 00:02:06.749 
input from VGA you could use an adsr but

00:02:06.749 --> 00:02:08.059 
input from VGA you could use an adsr but
for<00:02:06.899> the<00:02:06.989> sake<00:02:07.169> of<00:02:07.200> showing<00:02:07.349> that<00:02:07.770> decay<00:02:08.009> of

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
for the sake of showing that decay of

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:09.949 
for the sake of showing that decay of
the<00:02:08.190> back<00:02:08.340> row<00:02:08.550> I'm<00:02:09.030> going<00:02:09.450> to<00:02:09.509> go<00:02:09.599> ahead<00:02:09.690> and

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
the back row I'm going to go ahead and

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.170 
the back row I'm going to go ahead and
just<00:02:10.110> use<00:02:10.229> the<00:02:10.530> gate<00:02:10.679> signal<00:02:10.920> and<00:02:11.250> on<00:02:11.790> the<00:02:12.000> Fat

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
just use the gate signal and on the Fat

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.070 
just use the gate signal and on the Fat
Controller

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
Controller

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.910 
Controller
you<00:02:14.650> can<00:02:14.830> set<00:02:15.280> the<00:02:15.430> gate<00:02:15.670> time<00:02:16.500> to<00:02:17.500> be<00:02:17.650> at

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
you can set the gate time to be at

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.530 
you can set the gate time to be at
length<00:02:18.160> I'll<00:02:18.370> set<00:02:18.550> it<00:02:18.580> to<00:02:18.760> a<00:02:18.790> nice<00:02:18.970> length<00:02:19.209> here

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
length I'll set it to a nice length here

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.559 
length I'll set it to a nice length here
and<00:02:19.720> then<00:02:19.900> we'll<00:02:20.910> shorten<00:02:21.910> it<00:02:22.120> down<00:02:22.180> so<00:02:22.540> you

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:22.569 
and then we'll shorten it down so you

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:25.020 
and then we'll shorten it down so you
can<00:02:22.720> hear<00:02:22.840> the<00:02:22.959> decay<00:02:23.200> of<00:02:23.230> the<00:02:23.380> back<00:02:23.530> row<00:02:24.030> okay

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
can hear the decay of the back row okay

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:43.320 
can hear the decay of the back row okay
so<00:02:25.090> we're<00:02:25.360> going<00:02:25.450> to<00:02:25.540> start<00:02:25.780> the<00:02:25.900> sequence

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.330 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.309 

okay<00:02:44.330> so<00:02:44.390> we're<00:02:44.599> gonna<00:02:44.690> come<00:02:44.900> back<00:02:44.989> over<00:02:45.049> to

00:02:45.309 --> 00:02:45.319 
okay so we're gonna come back over to

00:02:45.319 --> 00:03:00.160 
okay so we're gonna come back over to
the<00:02:45.409> gate<00:02:45.620> I'm<00:02:46.510> shorten<00:02:47.510> that<00:02:47.569> down<00:02:59.170> what

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170 
the gate I'm shorten that down what

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:01.479 
the gate I'm shorten that down what
you're<00:03:00.290> really<00:03:00.409> listening<00:03:00.799> for<00:03:01.040> here<00:03:01.250> and<00:03:01.400> I'm

00:03:01.479 --> 00:03:01.489 
you're really listening for here and I'm

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:02.860 
you're really listening for here and I'm
trying<00:03:01.730> to<00:03:01.819> demonstrate<00:03:01.940> is<00:03:02.420> the<00:03:02.450> fact<00:03:02.780> that

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
trying to demonstrate is the fact that

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:54.180 
trying to demonstrate is the fact that
there's<00:03:03.470> no<00:03:03.650> envelope<00:03:04.040> generator<00:03:04.430> being<00:03:04.640> used

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.190 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:56.860 

and<00:03:55.190> that's<00:03:55.340> it<00:03:55.519> that's<00:03:55.669> about<00:03:56.239> what<00:03:56.629> it's

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:56.870 
and that's it that's about what it's

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:58.150 
and that's it that's about what it's
gonna<00:03:57.049> the<00:03:57.260> circuit<00:03:57.560> is<00:03:57.620> going<00:03:57.680> to<00:03:57.799> end<00:03:57.919> up<00:03:58.040> to

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:58.160 
gonna the circuit is going to end up to

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:59.589 
gonna the circuit is going to end up to
be<00:03:58.190> again<00:03:58.760> it's<00:03:58.910> going<00:03:59.030> to<00:03:59.090> be<00:03:59.150> pretty<00:03:59.389> much<00:03:59.569> a

00:03:59.589 --> 00:03:59.599 
be again it's going to be pretty much a

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:02.349 
be again it's going to be pretty much a
straight<00:03:59.900> duplication<00:04:00.590> and<00:04:01.090> the<00:04:02.090> circuit

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:02.359 
straight duplication and the circuit

00:04:02.359 --> 00:04:04.210 
straight duplication and the circuit
boards<00:04:02.599> the<00:04:03.319> mini<00:04:03.530> circuit<00:04:03.709> boards<00:04:04.069> I'm

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:04.220 
boards the mini circuit boards I'm

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:05.559 
boards the mini circuit boards I'm
trying<00:04:04.519> to<00:04:04.579> put<00:04:04.730> together<00:04:04.790> our<00:04:05.060> aimed<00:04:05.389> at

00:04:05.559 --> 00:04:05.569 
trying to put together our aimed at

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:08.289 
trying to put together our aimed at
being<00:04:05.690> very<00:04:06.470> cost<00:04:06.739> effective<00:04:07.250> basically<00:04:08.150> all

00:04:08.289 --> 00:04:08.299 
being very cost effective basically all

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:10.390 
being very cost effective basically all
of<00:04:08.449> them<00:04:08.599> will<00:04:08.780> have<00:04:08.810> one<00:04:09.500> board<00:04:09.799> mounted<00:04:09.980> pot

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:10.400 
of them will have one board mounted pot

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:14.559 
of them will have one board mounted pot
and<00:04:11.379> maybe<00:04:12.379> one<00:04:12.709> or<00:04:12.859> two<00:04:12.889> off<00:04:13.250> board<00:04:13.639> pots<00:04:13.940> but

00:04:14.559 --> 00:04:14.569 
and maybe one or two off board pots but

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:16.629 
and maybe one or two off board pots but
the<00:04:14.690> idea<00:04:14.989> being<00:04:15.260> that<00:04:15.440> any<00:04:15.919> format<00:04:16.400> whether

00:04:16.629 --> 00:04:16.639 
the idea being that any format whether

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:19.420 
the idea being that any format whether
you're<00:04:16.849> Euro<00:04:17.090> five<00:04:17.449> you<00:04:18.130> whatever<00:04:19.130> you<00:04:19.280> got

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:19.430 
you're Euro five you whatever you got

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:21.849 
you're Euro five you whatever you got
going<00:04:19.729> you<00:04:19.940> can<00:04:20.660> pretty<00:04:20.959> much<00:04:21.049> pop<00:04:21.380> this<00:04:21.590> board

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:21.859 
going you can pretty much pop this board

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:23.589 
going you can pretty much pop this board
into<00:04:22.190> any<00:04:22.340> module<00:04:22.760> that<00:04:22.880> you<00:04:22.940> want<00:04:23.120> to<00:04:23.210> modify

00:04:23.589 --> 00:04:23.599 
into any module that you want to modify

00:04:23.599 --> 00:04:25.930 
into any module that you want to modify
and
