once<00:00:01.469> you've<00:00:01.650> cast<00:00:01.890> on<00:00:02.190> as<00:00:02.429> many<00:00:02.730> stitches<00:00:02.970> as

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:03.179 
once you've cast on as many stitches as

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:06.940 
once you've cast on as many stitches as
you<00:00:03.419> need<00:00:03.629> you're<00:00:04.440> ready<00:00:04.620> to<00:00:04.770> begin<00:00:04.890> knitting

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:06.950 
you need you're ready to begin knitting

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:09.530 
you need you're ready to begin knitting
make<00:00:07.950> sure<00:00:08.189> you've<00:00:08.400> aligned<00:00:08.760> all<00:00:09.269> your

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
make sure you've aligned all your

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.629 
make sure you've aligned all your
stitches<00:00:09.780> in<00:00:10.080> this<00:00:10.230> way<00:00:10.469> so<00:00:11.130> that<00:00:11.160> the<00:00:11.340> bumps

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
stitches in this way so that the bumps

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:14.390 
stitches in this way so that the bumps
are<00:00:11.790> on<00:00:11.880> the<00:00:11.969> bottom<00:00:12.120> and<00:00:12.920> the<00:00:13.920> loops<00:00:14.099> are<00:00:14.309> on

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
are on the bottom and the loops are on

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.660 
are on the bottom and the loops are on
the<00:00:14.519> top<00:00:14.990> you're<00:00:15.990> always<00:00:16.199> going<00:00:16.590> to<00:00:16.650> work<00:00:16.949> from

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
the top you're always going to work from

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.380 
the top you're always going to work from
underneath<00:00:18.270> the<00:00:18.750> left-hand<00:00:19.199> needle<00:00:20.359> you<00:00:21.359> need

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
underneath the left-hand needle you need

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.330 
underneath the left-hand needle you need
to<00:00:21.660> make<00:00:21.840> sure<00:00:21.869> that<00:00:22.140> you<00:00:22.500> have<00:00:22.710> the<00:00:22.920> yarn<00:00:23.130> at

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
to make sure that you have the yarn at

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.330 
to make sure that you have the yarn at
the<00:00:23.519> back<00:00:23.699> of<00:00:23.730> the<00:00:24.000> work<00:00:24.150> and<00:00:24.920> be<00:00:25.920> careful<00:00:26.279> not

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
the back of the work and be careful not

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.670 
the back of the work and be careful not
to<00:00:26.580> bring<00:00:26.760> it<00:00:26.880> over<00:00:27.029> your<00:00:27.599> needle<00:00:27.960> because

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
to bring it over your needle because

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.910 
to bring it over your needle because
this<00:00:28.980> will<00:00:29.160> form<00:00:29.400> another<00:00:29.609> loop<00:00:30.650> so<00:00:31.650> you<00:00:31.710> will

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
this will form another loop so you will

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.900 
this will form another loop so you will
have<00:00:32.040> an<00:00:32.160> extra<00:00:32.430> stitch<00:00:34.460> it's<00:00:35.460> helpful<00:00:35.760> to

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
have an extra stitch it's helpful to

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.819 
have an extra stitch it's helpful to
remember<00:00:36.030> how<00:00:36.510> many<00:00:36.570> stitches<00:00:36.989> you<00:00:37.200> cast<00:00:37.559> on

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
remember how many stitches you cast on

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.299 
remember how many stitches you cast on
and<00:00:38.450> count<00:00:39.450> at<00:00:39.870> the<00:00:40.200> end<00:00:40.350> of<00:00:40.530> every<00:00:40.800> row<00:00:40.980> to

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
and count at the end of every row to

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.459 
and count at the end of every row to
make<00:00:41.340> sure<00:00:41.670> you<00:00:41.790> haven't<00:00:42.090> added<00:00:42.300> or<00:00:42.960> decreased

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
make sure you haven't added or decreased

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:48.110 
make sure you haven't added or decreased
any<00:00:43.680> stitches<00:00:44.989> so<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.170> knit<00:00:46.350> stitch<00:00:46.649> is<00:00:47.280> very

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
any stitches so the knit stitch is very

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.240 
any stitches so the knit stitch is very
similar<00:00:48.719> to<00:00:48.870> the<00:00:48.989> cast<00:00:49.200> on<00:00:49.969> once<00:00:50.969> again<00:00:52.070> we<00:00:53.070> go

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
similar to the cast on once again we go

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.670 
similar to the cast on once again we go
into<00:00:53.399> this<00:00:53.699> first<00:00:54.030> loop<00:00:54.410> from<00:00:55.410> the<00:00:55.590> left<00:00:57.680> like

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
into this first loop from the left like

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.799 
into this first loop from the left like
so<00:01:00.320> then<00:01:01.320> we<00:01:01.500> take<00:01:01.680> our<00:01:02.489> working<00:01:02.820> yarn<00:01:03.059> the<00:01:03.629> one

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
so then we take our working yarn the one

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.080 
so then we take our working yarn the one
that's<00:01:03.989> attached<00:01:04.290> to<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.619> ball<00:01:04.769> and<00:01:05.070> we<00:01:05.909> make

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
that's attached to the ball and we make

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.560 
that's attached to the ball and we make
a<00:01:06.299> clockwise<00:01:06.869> loop<00:01:07.850> around<00:01:08.850> our<00:01:09.119> right<00:01:09.299> hand

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
a clockwise loop around our right hand

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.240 
a clockwise loop around our right hand
needle<00:01:10.250> and<00:01:11.250> we<00:01:11.909> pull<00:01:12.150> this<00:01:12.299> loop<00:01:13.100> through<00:01:14.100> the

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
needle and we pull this loop through the

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.600 
needle and we pull this loop through the
loop<00:01:14.460> on<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.450> left<00:01:15.570> hand<00:01:15.900> needle

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:16.610 
loop on the left hand needle

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.200 
loop on the left hand needle
now<00:01:17.610> instead<00:01:18.030> of<00:01:18.150> placing<00:01:18.390> this<00:01:19.380> new<00:01:19.860> loop

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:20.210 
now instead of placing this new loop

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:23.570 
now instead of placing this new loop
onto<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.299> left<00:01:21.479> hand<00:01:21.750> needle<00:01:22.400> we're<00:01:23.400> actually

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
onto the left hand needle we're actually

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.390 
onto the left hand needle we're actually
going<00:01:24.000> to<00:01:24.119> drop<00:01:24.420> the<00:01:25.020> last<00:01:25.259> stitch<00:01:25.560> off<00:01:26.340> the

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
going to drop the last stitch off the

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.149 
going to drop the last stitch off the
left<00:01:26.850> hand<00:01:27.270> needle<00:01:27.950> and<00:01:28.950> weave<00:01:29.220> knit<00:01:29.430> a<00:01:29.460> stitch

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:31.159 
left hand needle and weave knit a stitch

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:34.340 
left hand needle and weave knit a stitch
now<00:01:32.159> we<00:01:32.280> just<00:01:32.640> repeat<00:01:32.729> this<00:01:33.180> with<00:01:34.079> all<00:01:34.200> the

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
now we just repeat this with all the

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.390 
now we just repeat this with all the
other<00:01:34.380> stitches<00:01:34.829> on<00:01:35.430> the<00:01:35.520> left<00:01:35.729> hand<00:01:35.939> needle

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:37.400 
other stitches on the left hand needle

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:41.810 
other stitches on the left hand needle
so<00:01:38.400> we<00:01:38.549> pull<00:01:38.759> the<00:01:38.850> loop<00:01:39.060> and<00:01:40.189> if<00:01:41.189> we<00:01:41.400> just<00:01:41.610> talk

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
so we pull the loop and if we just talk

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.600 
so we pull the loop and if we just talk
on<00:01:42.000> this<00:01:42.710> the<00:01:43.710> loop<00:01:43.890> will<00:01:44.100> drop<00:01:44.280> off<00:01:44.460> the

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
on this the loop will drop off the

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:50.139 
on this the loop will drop off the
left-hand<00:01:45.000> needle<00:01:46.340> you<00:01:47.340> go<00:01:47.520> in<00:01:47.899> from<00:01:48.899> the<00:01:49.049> left

00:01:50.139 --> 00:01:50.149 
left-hand needle you go in from the left

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:58.639 
left-hand needle you go in from the left
find<00:01:51.149> I<00:01:51.420> on<00:01:51.600> round<00:01:53.479> and<00:01:54.479> gently<00:01:56.509> then<00:01:57.509> drop<00:01:58.469> a

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
find I on round and gently then drop a

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:04.030 
find I on round and gently then drop a
stitch<00:01:58.890> off

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:04.040 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:08.390 

so<00:02:05.040> now<00:02:05.280> you<00:02:05.760> know<00:02:05.910> how<00:02:06.060> to<00:02:06.090> knit
