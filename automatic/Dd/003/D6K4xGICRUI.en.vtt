00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:48.620

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.059
 spain early september 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:55.309
 that's why I did not give 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:55.790
 a lot of news now I'm 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:57.470
 back 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:59.239
 and today I offer you a 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:01.220
 new sewing tutorial 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:02.690
 I could not wait to introduce you since 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:05.120
 it's been a few weeks since 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:06.770
 I had this idea in mind so like the 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.530
 name of an evening monday that today 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:10.670
 we will powder an asymmetrical skirt 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:12.380
 it's very fashionable right now 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.000
 very trendy I was inspired 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.530
 particular model that I saw in the 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.930
 magazines and on the internet 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.340
 and I hope you will like it in a 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:22.780
 first time I 'm going to train more 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.780
 accessory how to use 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:44.660
 contrary to what we can think 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.550
 the realization of this skirt takes us 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:47.510
 really not much time is very 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:49.040
 easy to make 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:51.530
 if you remember my last 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:53.000
 tutorial consisted of sewing a jacket 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.520
 you can find it by clicking 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.260
 just here 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.820
 and this tellin tutorial of more complicated 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.860
 we have done so far 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:02.780
 so compared to this one sew a 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.070
 asymmetrical skirt it will be cake 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.210
 kingdom 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.800
 I will not go later I will 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:09.250
 start immediately the realization 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.250
 of my skirt 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:15.680
 to start I talmont fabric on the 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:17.290
 table had then become pinned the 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.599
 boss on this one 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:22.430
 I pin it well edge to edge at the level 

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:25.840
 from the top of the skirt and then I will come 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.840
 cut all around 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:18.450
 before bending the elastic with the top 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:20.489
 of my skirt I will do but 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:22.670
 the elastic using machines to 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:22.670
 to sew 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:34.230
 I then spread the fabric that goes to me 

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:36.090
 serve for the realization of my skirt 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:38.909
 on his place so as to have 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:41.069
 back to me I folded back 

00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:44.810
 inside both edges which features 

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:44.810
 divested asymmetric 

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:50.129
 we can now sew the elastic 

00:03:48.389 --> 00:03:51.870
 with the top of the skirt 

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:54.239
 now that the latter has been sewn 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:56.370
 I'm going at first pinned 

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:58.799
 each edge of the elastic with each 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:00.719
 edge of the skirt to be able to adjust 

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:03.090
 the whole skirt on the elastic 

00:04:00.719 --> 00:04:05.159
 it will then pleated the latter 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:05.790
 before pinning it on the ledge of 

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:08.370
 elastic 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:10.739
 obviously make sure all 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:13.530
 this step with your skirt flipping 

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:16.019
 on its back we can now sew 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:18.889
 the skirt and the elastic enters with the help of 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:18.889
 our sewing machine 

00:04:55.730 --> 00:05:00.090
 last step of my tutorial I'm going 

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:01.680
 now on yarn and sewing I 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:04.010

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:04.010

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:44.419
