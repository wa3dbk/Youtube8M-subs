you think that it was going to go mid uh

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.240 
you think that it was going to go mid uh
I<00:00:17.369> really<00:00:18.090> saw<00:00:18.270> that<00:00:18.619> gragas<00:00:19.619> is<00:00:19.770> going<00:00:20.070> mid

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
I really saw that gragas is going mid

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.700 
I really saw that gragas is going mid
and<00:00:22.189> like<00:00:23.189> I<00:00:23.789> was<00:00:24.480> thinking<00:00:24.930> about<00:00:25.140> ribbon<00:00:25.529> or

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
and like I was thinking about ribbon or

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.339 
and like I was thinking about ribbon or
Zed<00:00:26.010> but<00:00:26.849> after<00:00:27.420> seeing<00:00:27.630> like<00:00:27.840> glutes<00:00:28.109> and

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
Zed but after seeing like glutes and

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.370 
Zed but after seeing like glutes and
peak<00:00:28.650> and<00:00:29.130> listen<00:00:29.640> pig<00:00:29.880> I<00:00:30.150> thought<00:00:30.779> that<00:00:30.960> Z<00:00:31.349> is

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
peak and listen pig I thought that Z is

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.030 
peak and listen pig I thought that Z is
better<00:00:31.740> overall<00:00:32.570> so<00:00:33.570> I<00:00:34.110> decided<00:00:34.469> to<00:00:34.680> pick<00:00:34.829> that

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
better overall so I decided to pick that

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.580 
better overall so I decided to pick that
and<00:00:35.309> then<00:00:35.460> they<00:00:35.610> pick<00:00:35.969> fees<00:00:36.210> and<00:00:36.450> I<00:00:36.510> like<00:00:36.719> okay

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
and then they pick fees and I like okay

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.799 
and then they pick fees and I like okay
like<00:00:37.950> this<00:00:38.160> is<00:00:38.309> strong<00:00:38.550> against<00:00:38.850> that<00:00:39.059> Toby

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
like this is strong against that Toby

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.709 
like this is strong against that Toby
toe<00:00:40.579> but<00:00:41.579> I<00:00:41.640> was<00:00:41.790> sure<00:00:41.820> that<00:00:42.120> like<00:00:42.360> diamonds

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
toe but I was sure that like diamonds

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.330 
toe but I was sure that like diamonds
back<00:00:42.870> up<00:00:43.050> will<00:00:43.230> be<00:00:43.320> buyers<00:00:43.500> in<00:00:43.710> cyanides<00:00:44.100> for

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
back up will be buyers in cyanides for

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.430 
back up will be buyers in cyanides for
me<00:00:44.460> and<00:00:44.670> I<00:00:45.239> thought<00:00:45.570> it<00:00:45.660> will<00:00:45.809> be<00:00:45.960> stronger<00:00:46.200> to

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
me and I thought it will be stronger to

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.000 
me and I thought it will be stronger to
me<00:00:46.559> too<00:00:46.739> so<00:00:47.579> I<00:00:47.969> thought<00:00:48.870> I<00:00:49.289> will<00:00:49.469> be<00:00:49.680> okay<00:00:49.950> in

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010

me too so I thought I will be okay in
lane<00:00:50.190> and<00:00:50.520> overall<00:00:51.390> like<00:00:52.260> my<00:00:53.039> team<00:00:53.219> didn't

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:18.610 
am I gonna do now what did you do from
there<00:02:14.300> so<00:02:16.099> this<00:02:17.099> is<00:02:17.130> the<00:02:17.340> usual<00:02:17.489> gambit<00:02:17.970> game

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
there so this is the usual gambit game

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.920 
there so this is the usual gambit game
when<00:02:19.910> we<00:02:20.910> invite<00:02:21.180> on<00:02:21.300> blue<00:02:21.510> and<00:02:21.630> die<00:02:21.750> again

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
when we invite on blue and die again

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:27.229 
when we invite on blue and die again
static<00:02:22.200> so<00:02:22.920> it's<00:02:23.220> our<00:02:23.370> tradition<00:02:24.950> so<00:02:25.950> after<00:02:26.640> we

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239 
static so it's our tradition so after we

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:29.120 
static so it's our tradition so after we
lost<00:02:27.599> a<00:02:27.750> couple<00:02:27.840> of<00:02:28.140> games<00:02:28.290> like<00:02:28.560> that<00:02:28.590> we<00:02:29.069> are

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
lost a couple of games like that we are

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.190 
lost a couple of games like that we are
getting<00:02:29.250> used<00:02:29.550> to<00:02:29.730> it<00:02:29.849> so<00:02:30.420> it<00:02:30.690> was<00:02:30.720> much<00:02:30.989> easier

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
getting used to it so it was much easier

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.960 
getting used to it so it was much easier
this<00:02:31.530> time<00:02:31.590> and<00:02:32.599> I<00:02:33.599> think<00:02:34.560> that<00:02:34.709> after<00:02:35.640> like

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
this time and I think that after like

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.479 
this time and I think that after like
they<00:02:36.180> died<00:02:36.360> too<00:02:36.630> I<00:02:36.900> think<00:02:37.650> that<00:02:37.769> Darren<00:02:38.130> got

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:38.489 
they died too I think that Darren got

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:41.330 
they died too I think that Darren got
some<00:02:38.760> of<00:02:38.880> experience<00:02:39.810> that<00:02:40.050> he<00:02:40.349> needed<00:02:40.530> for<00:02:41.160> 1

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
some of experience that he needed for 1

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.509 
some of experience that he needed for 1
V<00:02:41.489> 2<00:02:41.519> I<00:02:42.440> expecting<00:02:43.440> at<00:02:43.560> late<00:02:43.739> to<00:02:43.920> lane<00:02:44.099> so<00:02:44.400> he

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:44.519 
V 2 I expecting at late to lane so he

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:46.850 
V 2 I expecting at late to lane so he
lost<00:02:44.670> some<00:02:44.850> experience<00:02:45.420> and<00:02:45.690> overall<00:02:46.650> I<00:02:46.680> think

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
lost some experience and overall I think

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.400 
lost some experience and overall I think
that<00:02:47.160> like<00:02:48.030> okay<00:02:48.360> gragas<00:02:48.750> could<00:02:48.989> deal<00:02:49.170> with

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
that like okay gragas could deal with

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.430 
that like okay gragas could deal with
the<00:02:49.530> lane<00:02:49.709> but<00:02:50.220> I<00:02:50.250> think<00:02:50.819> you<00:02:50.910> could<00:02:51.030> do<00:02:51.209> it

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 
the lane but I think you could do it

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:53.960 
the lane but I think you could do it
overall<00:02:52.440> like<00:02:52.799> gragas<00:02:53.190> would<00:02:53.340> be<00:02:53.430> denied<00:02:53.760> less

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
overall like gragas would be denied less

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.780 
overall like gragas would be denied less
than<00:02:54.239> mundo<00:02:54.569> so<00:02:55.560> this<00:02:56.010> was<00:02:56.190> like<00:02:56.370> only<00:02:56.640> two

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
than mundo so this was like only two

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.370 
than mundo so this was like only two
kills<00:02:57.090> that<00:02:57.269> give<00:02:57.420> less<00:02:57.569> gold<00:02:57.810> then<00:02:58.230> they

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
kills that give less gold then they

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:01.070 
kills that give less gold then they
usually<00:02:58.769> did<00:02:59.040> so<00:02:59.790> it<00:02:59.940> was<00:03:00.090> okay<00:03:00.660> because<00:03:00.840> they

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
usually did so it was okay because they

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.630 
usually did so it was okay because they
didn't<00:03:01.319> even<00:03:01.380> invite<00:03:01.709> our<00:03:01.890> blue<00:03:02.130> or<00:03:02.220> anything

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
didn't even invite our blue or anything

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.729 
didn't even invite our blue or anything
