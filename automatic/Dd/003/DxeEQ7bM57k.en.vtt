00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:04.420 
the energy fields is you know for years

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:06.359 
the energy fields is you know for years
now<00:01:04.749> look<00:01:05.259> back<00:01:05.469> on<00:01:05.499> will<00:01:05.829> G<00:01:06.009> that<00:01:06.189> very

that's how that's how quickly things

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.709 
that's how that's how quickly things
move<00:01:50.259> and<00:01:50.409> I<00:01:50.439> think<00:01:50.649> really<00:01:50.799> 10<00:01:51.100> years<00:01:51.310> ago<00:01:51.719> you

00:01:52.709 --> 00:01:52.719 
move and I think really 10 years ago you

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:54.809 
move and I think really 10 years ago you
know<00:01:52.810> chiropractic<00:01:53.560> everyone<00:01:53.950> and<00:01:54.159> medicine

00:01:54.809 --> 00:01:54.819 
know chiropractic everyone and medicine

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:56.879 
know chiropractic everyone and medicine
hated<00:01:55.149> it<00:01:55.270> and<00:01:55.509> then<00:01:55.749> homeopathy<00:01:56.229> is<00:01:56.590> is

00:01:56.879 --> 00:01:56.889 
hated it and then homeopathy is is

00:01:56.889 --> 00:01:59.730 
hated it and then homeopathy is is
barely<00:01:57.609> still<00:01:58.090> acceptable<00:01:58.600> and<00:01:59.079> energy

00:01:59.730 --> 00:01:59.740 
barely still acceptable and energy

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.219 
barely still acceptable and energy
medicine<00:02:00.219> that<00:02:00.999> was<00:02:01.179> a<00:02:01.209> definite<00:02:01.719> no-no<00:02:01.959> in

that's on the kind of on the frontier

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:10.199 
that's on the kind of on the frontier
with<00:02:08.530> homeopathy<00:02:08.860> and<00:02:09.489> even<00:02:10.119> though

non-traditional heating for years and

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:28.570 
have experienced it myself so that I

works but not completely but I do know

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.060 
works but not completely but I do know
that<00:02:33.970> we<00:02:34.270> human<00:02:34.600> beings<00:02:34.630> and<00:02:35.140> can<00:02:35.830> heal

ourselves and it has a lot to do with

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:06.520 
to be focused much more on healing than

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:08.220 
to be focused much more on healing than
we<00:03:06.670> are<00:03:06.700> right<00:03:06.850> now<00:03:07.180> we're<00:03:07.390> really<00:03:07.480> so<00:03:07.810> focused

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
we are right now we're really so focused

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.740 
we are right now we're really so focused
on<00:03:08.350> on<00:03:08.620> the<00:03:08.860> mechanics<00:03:09.430> of<00:03:09.550> Medicine<00:03:10.030> on<00:03:10.180> the

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
on on the mechanics of Medicine on the

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:12.300 
on on the mechanics of Medicine on the
use<00:03:10.930> of<00:03:10.960> pharmaceuticals<00:03:11.860> in<00:03:12.010> surgery<00:03:12.280> now

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
use of pharmaceuticals in surgery now

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:13.980 
use of pharmaceuticals in surgery now
these<00:03:12.730> aren't<00:03:13.000> great<00:03:13.210> tools<00:03:13.480> now<00:03:13.780> that<00:03:13.960> I

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:13.990 
these aren't great tools now that I

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:16.230 
these aren't great tools now that I
don't<00:03:14.170> prescribe<00:03:14.380> them<00:03:14.680> myself<00:03:14.860> but<00:03:15.280> I<00:03:15.790> think

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:16.240 
don't prescribe them myself but I think

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:17.640 
don't prescribe them myself but I think
it's<00:03:16.390> about<00:03:16.510> being<00:03:16.810> integrative<00:03:17.410> and<00:03:17.560> it's

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
it's about being integrative and it's

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:19.770 
it's about being integrative and it's
using<00:03:17.920> the<00:03:17.950> best<00:03:18.220> of<00:03:18.370> all<00:03:18.880> resources<00:03:19.060> are<00:03:19.600> at

using the best of all resources are at

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:21.840 
using the best of all resources are at
our<00:03:19.930> disposal<00:03:20.320> I<00:03:20.560> love<00:03:20.890> scanning<00:03:21.310> technology

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:21.850 
our disposal I love scanning technology

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:23.580 
our disposal I love scanning technology
and<00:03:21.940> genomics<00:03:22.360> and<00:03:22.570> stem<00:03:22.780> so<00:03:22.990> incredibly

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590 
and genomics and stem so incredibly

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:27.090 
and genomics and stem so incredibly
exciting<00:03:24.720> but<00:03:25.720> I<00:03:25.750> think<00:03:26.050> that<00:03:26.200> actually<00:03:26.590> being

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:27.100 
exciting but I think that actually being

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:29.700 
exciting but I think that actually being
much<00:03:27.310> more<00:03:27.520> grounded<00:03:28.030> in<00:03:28.180> using<00:03:28.710> therapies

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:29.710 
much more grounded in using therapies

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:31.230 
much more grounded in using therapies
and<00:03:30.010> approaches<00:03:30.520> that<00:03:30.550> have<00:03:30.670> been<00:03:30.850> around<00:03:30.940> for

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:31.240 
and approaches that have been around for

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:33.780 
and approaches that have been around for
years<00:03:31.750> or<00:03:32.260> decades<00:03:32.440> or<00:03:32.890> sometimes<00:03:33.310> millennia

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:33.790 
years or decades or sometimes millennia

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:35.190 
years or decades or sometimes millennia
I<00:03:34.030> think<00:03:34.480> incorporating<00:03:35.050> this<00:03:35.140> into

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:35.200 
I think incorporating this into

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:36.870 
I think incorporating this into
healthcare<00:03:35.680> and<00:03:36.100> using<00:03:36.340> the<00:03:36.400> best<00:03:36.580> of<00:03:36.760> all

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:36.880 
healthcare and using the best of all

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.130 
healthcare and using the best of all
resources<00:03:37.060> going<00:03:37.690> to<00:03:37.750> make<00:03:37.870> a<00:03:37.900> dramatic

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:38.140 
resources going to make a dramatic

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:41.280 
resources going to make a dramatic
difference<00:03:38.610> as<00:03:39.610> medicine<00:03:40.180> becomes<00:03:40.480> has<00:03:41.260> a

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.290 
difference as medicine becomes has a

35%<00:03:46.570> the<00:03:46.630> nation's<00:03:46.900> medical<00:03:47.110> school<00:03:47.560> deans

35% the nation's medical school deans
now<00:03:48.040> has<00:03:48.520> said<00:03:48.790> that<00:03:48.910> medical<00:03:49.300> school

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:49.450 
now has said that medical school

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:51.360 
now has said that medical school
education<00:03:49.840> should<00:03:50.170> be<00:03:50.230> integrative<00:03:50.920> so<00:03:51.340> i

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:51.370 
education should be integrative so i

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:53.160 
education should be integrative so i
think<00:03:51.460> that<00:03:51.790> the<00:03:51.970> even<00:03:52.360> the<00:03:52.480> establishment<00:03:53.110> is

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:53.170 
think that the even the establishment is

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:55.230 
think that the even the establishment is
recognizing<00:03:53.890> that<00:03:54.370> a<00:03:54.430> change<00:03:54.730> needs<00:03:54.970> to<00:03:55.030> take

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:55.240 
recognizing that a change needs to take

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:57.690 
recognizing that a change needs to take
place<00:03:55.270> in<00:03:55.810> how<00:03:56.020> consumers<00:03:56.560> or<00:03:57.160> receiving

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:57.700 
place in how consumers or receiving

00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:59.610 
place in how consumers or receiving
their<00:03:57.880> healthcare<00:03:58.150> it<00:03:58.420> and<00:03:58.600> how<00:03:58.720> doctors<00:03:59.500> are

their healthcare it and how doctors are

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:02.370 
their healthcare it and how doctors are
changed<00:03:59.980> so<00:04:00.100> for<00:04:00.310> me<00:04:00.460> I<00:04:00.870> mr.<00:04:01.870> glasshalffull

changed so for me I mr. glasshalffull

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:04.740 
changed so for me I mr. glasshalffull
anyway<00:04:02.890> but<00:04:03.100> I<00:04:03.310> really<00:04:04.090> think<00:04:04.120> that<00:04:04.420> this<00:04:04.540> is

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:04.750 
anyway but I really think that this is

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:08.490 
anyway but I really think that this is
both<00:04:05.080> extremely<00:04:05.500> well<00:04:05.740> for<00:04:05.770> the<00:04:06.370> future<00:04:07.500> we're
