market yet as you can see in that pack

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.150 
market yet as you can see in that pack
we<00:02:16.450> do<00:02:16.569> get<00:02:16.720> another<00:02:16.930> pelay<00:02:17.230> about<00:02:17.860> the<00:02:17.980> fifth

we do get another pelay about the fifth

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.440 
we do get another pelay about the fifth
or<00:02:18.220> sixth<00:02:18.520> time<00:02:18.550> we<00:02:18.819> add<00:02:18.910> them<00:02:19.030> in<00:02:19.090> these<00:02:19.180> packs

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
or sixth time we add them in these packs

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.390 
or sixth time we add them in these packs
is<00:02:19.599> quite<00:02:19.959> a<00:02:19.989> bit<00:02:20.170> of<00:02:20.230> a<00:02:20.260> troll<00:02:20.500> and<00:02:20.680> we<00:02:21.190> did<00:02:21.340> get

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
is quite a bit of a troll and we did get

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.670 
is quite a bit of a troll and we did get
a<00:02:21.459> simulator<00:02:21.849> and<00:02:22.209> a<00:02:22.360> couple<00:02:22.569> of<00:02:22.690> more<00:02:22.900> and<00:02:23.110> I

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
a simulator and a couple of more and I

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.010 
a simulator and a couple of more and I
think<00:02:23.890> we<00:02:24.400> will<00:02:24.880> acquire<00:02:25.060> quite<00:02:25.510> close<00:02:25.810> to

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:26.020 
think we will acquire quite close to

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:27.720 
think we will acquire quite close to
breaking<00:02:26.230> even<00:02:26.410> from<00:02:26.770> that<00:02:26.800> pattern<00:02:27.340> because

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
breaking even from that pattern because

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.089 
breaking even from that pattern because
I<00:02:27.760> think<00:02:28.000> I've<00:02:28.450> now<00:02:29.140> sold<00:02:29.470> everything<00:02:29.680> I<00:02:29.890> think

00:02:30.089 --> 00:02:30.099 
I think I've now sold everything I think

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:33.449 
I think I've now sold everything I think
around<00:02:30.400> 500<00:02:31.000> to<00:02:31.060> 600<00:02:31.300> k<00:02:31.569> back<00:02:31.780> from<00:02:32.050> 1.1<00:02:32.560> mil<00:02:32.890> so

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:33.459 
around 500 to 600 k back from 1.1 mil so

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:35.490 
around 500 to 600 k back from 1.1 mil so
that's<00:02:33.730> not<00:02:33.880> the<00:02:33.940> worst<00:02:34.209> of<00:02:34.540> returns<00:02:35.170> to<00:02:35.410> be

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
that's not the worst of returns to be

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.589 
that's not the worst of returns to be
fair<00:02:35.739> and<00:02:35.890> in<00:02:36.370> the<00:02:36.489> courts<00:02:36.730> below<00:02:36.760> guys<00:02:37.090> if<00:02:37.239> you
