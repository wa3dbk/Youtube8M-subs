00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.550
 he does not know 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:22.640
 the 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.640
 he 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.970
 now we are not surprised we have 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:29.790
 worked all week for that 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:31.230
 and then that was the match he 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.480
 had to make a good match at near the 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:37.020
 defeat at Aurillac and we do not take 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:40.920
 points so that's for sure 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:43.740
 pleased to win from finishing to finish 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.930
 the block of 4 on a five victory 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:46.440
 points so it's good at the level 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.650
 accounting 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:52.350
 the team was really really ultra 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:54.690
 ultra performant that you dominated 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:56.280
 really bizarre you do it for sure 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:59.430
 we made a good match everyone 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:02.190
 to focus on what will be going to 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.720
 do so here we are happy to 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:06.270
 to win 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:11.100
 here I think this victory is going 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:12.930
 serve for one for the rest of the matches 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:14.520
 earlier and earlier in half hue and 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:17.370
 it is true that we had at heart to 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:19.110
 redeem to send the game to make 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:22.110
 doe noise thinks having this after 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:23.340
 at noon we did some nice rugby and we 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:25.140
 had good deeds but rather I 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.560
 think a good match overall 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:29.210
 look so we are rather satisfied 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:31.860
 and reassured 

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:33.420
 good will reassure no because we knew 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:35.240
 that we were capable of the red star 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:38.550
 it is sure that after we made matches 

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:41.680
 rather complicated against 

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:44.530
 masisi justin young 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:46.540
 aurillac good we knew we were going 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:47.890
 stop there and we put that in place 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:50.230
 this week 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:52.090
 we also saw to let go a little bit 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:54.430
 a little bit more to play between this 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:56.640
 father so what are we going to do and it has rather 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:56.640
 fear 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:06.269
 to dominate them much less you can 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:08.730
 pitiful detail every week 

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:10.470
 we are going to work it is that we had a 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:12.540
 point of honor to have a big but 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:14.220
 today I think on the whole 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:16.260
 matches but rather pretty good she 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:17.459
 would be that he was keen to dominate 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.930
 it's always easier for people 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:21.209
 three quarters of the dominated to have the 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:23.639
 balloons so here we were we did it 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:26.160
 after telling me here we are writing we are 

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:28.800
 rather rather happy that this is 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:31.940
 always the expression mandanda - sagna 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.940
 what's more, of quality
