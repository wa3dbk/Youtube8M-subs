00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
references to the original series like

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.120 
references to the original series like
certain<00:01:33.509> characters<00:01:33.960> different<00:01:34.500> mechs<00:01:34.920> and

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
certain characters different mechs and

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.399 
certain characters different mechs and
stuff<00:01:35.310> like<00:01:35.520> that<00:01:35.759> and<00:01:36.030> once<00:01:36.930> again<00:01:37.110> I<00:01:37.259> think

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
stuff like that and once again I think

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.200 
stuff like that and once again I think
this<00:01:37.619> episode<00:01:38.070> might<00:01:38.280> be<00:01:38.400> doing<00:01:38.729> something

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
this episode might be doing something

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.819 
this episode might be doing something
like<00:01:39.240> that<00:01:39.509> I<00:01:39.750> feel<00:01:40.020> like<00:01:40.049> this<00:01:40.320> episode<00:01:40.740> is

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
like that I feel like this episode is

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.530 
like that I feel like this episode is
trying<00:01:41.100> to<00:01:41.280> make<00:01:41.430> references<00:01:42.060> to<00:01:42.119> its

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
trying to make references to its

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.080 
trying to make references to its
previous<00:01:42.930> series<00:01:43.200> and<00:01:43.680> that<00:01:44.220> is<00:01:44.399> why<00:01:44.610> it's

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
previous series and that is why it's

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.789 
previous series and that is why it's
kind<00:01:45.299> of<00:01:45.450> like<00:01:45.600> it<00:01:45.750> was<00:01:45.899> in<00:01:46.079> this<00:01:46.170> episode<00:01:46.619> and

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
kind of like it was in this episode and

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.039 
kind of like it was in this episode and

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
why us new anime fans might walk into

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.050 
why us new anime fans might walk into

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
there was a lot of potential set up

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.670 
there was a lot of potential set up
especially<00:03:03.060> with<00:03:03.300> how<00:03:03.450> we<00:03:03.510> had<00:03:03.840> to<00:03:04.020> wear<00:03:04.170> D

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.440 
ultraman Kingdom is living hell
there<00:03:08.130> was<00:03:08.220> a<00:03:08.250> lot<00:03:08.520> of<00:03:08.550> potential<00:03:09.270> for

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
there was a lot of potential for

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.120 
there was a lot of potential for
character<00:03:10.140> development<00:03:10.410> and<00:03:10.560> setup<00:03:10.980> with

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
character development and setup with

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:13.070 
character development and setup with
that<00:03:11.250> ending<00:03:11.550> of<00:03:11.670> last<00:03:11.880> week's<00:03:12.120> episode<00:03:12.270> and

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080 
that ending of last week's episode and

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:14.330 
that ending of last week's episode and
I'm<00:03:13.200> kind<00:03:13.410> of<00:03:13.500> disappointed<00:03:14.100> that<00:03:14.130> this

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
I'm kind of disappointed that this

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.340 
I'm kind of disappointed that this
episode<00:03:14.760> it<00:03:14.910> tried<00:03:15.150> to<00:03:15.180> dive<00:03:15.600> into<00:03:15.900> that<00:03:16.080> but

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
episode it tried to dive into that but

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:18.770 
episode it tried to dive into that but
at<00:03:16.470> the<00:03:16.560> exact<00:03:16.860> same<00:03:17.070> time<00:03:17.400> I'm<00:03:17.850> kind<00:03:18.360> of<00:03:18.540> happy

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
at the exact same time I'm kind of happy

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.350 
at the exact same time I'm kind of happy
it<00:03:19.110> didn't<00:03:19.620> because<00:03:20.010> this<00:03:20.220> episode<00:03:20.400> was<00:03:21.000> meant

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 
it didn't because this episode was meant

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.479 
it didn't because this episode was meant
as<00:03:21.480> comedy<00:03:22.320> and<00:03:22.590> if<00:03:22.920> you<00:03:23.010> would<00:03:23.160> have<00:03:23.220> tried<00:03:23.430> to

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:23.489 
as comedy and if you would have tried to

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:26.000 
as comedy and if you would have tried to
force<00:03:23.970> in<00:03:24.180> this<00:03:24.330> drama<00:03:24.690> type<00:03:25.110> tones<00:03:25.410> to<00:03:25.739> it<00:03:25.860> it

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
force in this drama type tones to it it

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:27.920 
force in this drama type tones to it it
might<00:03:26.220> have<00:03:26.370> felt<00:03:26.550> very<00:03:26.610> forced<00:03:27.300> and<00:03:27.540> it<00:03:27.750> might

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
might have felt very forced and it might

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:29.900 
might have felt very forced and it might
not<00:03:27.959> have<00:03:28.230> have<00:03:28.350> worked<00:03:28.620> out<00:03:28.860> as<00:03:29.190> properly<00:03:29.730> as

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
not have have worked out as properly as

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:32.750 
not have have worked out as properly as
it<00:03:30.090> did<00:03:30.270> in<00:03:30.390> this<00:03:30.510> episode<00:03:31.050> so<00:03:31.410> I<00:03:31.739> think<00:03:32.489> they

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
it did in this episode so I think they

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.190 
it did in this episode so I think they
most<00:03:32.970> likely<00:03:33.150> just<00:03:33.450> did<00:03:33.600> this<00:03:33.720> episode<00:03:34.080> to

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
most likely just did this episode to

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:35.690 
most likely just did this episode to
have<00:03:34.410> a<00:03:34.440> comedy<00:03:34.800> based<00:03:34.950> episode<00:03:35.400> and<00:03:35.550> maybe

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
have a comedy based episode and maybe

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.640 
have a comedy based episode and maybe
next<00:03:35.940> week<00:03:36.180> we<00:03:36.330> might<00:03:36.510> have<00:03:36.660> a<00:03:36.690> serious<00:03:37.200> drama

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
next week we might have a serious drama

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:39.979 
next week we might have a serious drama
filled<00:03:38.430> episode<00:03:39.090> we'll<00:03:39.270> have<00:03:39.450> to<00:03:39.600> see<00:03:39.780> but

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:39.989 
filled episode we'll have to see but

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:42.410 
filled episode we'll have to see but
