cables<00:01:28.110> and<00:01:28.350> check<00:01:28.829> it<00:01:29.040> at<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:29.250> inner

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:29.869

would thread in for your cable ends so
right<00:01:35.400> now<00:01:35.579> we<00:01:35.640> are<00:01:35.880> reading<00:01:36.299> 12<00:01:37.079> point<00:01:37.560> 12<00:01:38.100> or

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
right now we are reading 12 point 12 or

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.539 
right now we are reading 12 point 12 or
12<00:01:38.820> point<00:01:39.030> to<00:01:39.270> 4<00:01:39.600> volts<00:01:40.290> across<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:41.250> top<00:01:41.430> of

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
12 point to 4 volts across the top of

12 point to 4 volts across the top of
the<00:01:41.610> battery<00:01:41.790> terminals<00:01:42.360> so<00:01:43.049> now<00:01:43.290> what<00:01:43.500> you're

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
the battery terminals so now what you're

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.940 
the battery terminals so now what you're
gonna<00:01:43.770> do<00:01:44.070> is<00:01:44.549> you're<00:01:44.759> gonna<00:01:44.850> move<00:01:45.240> the<00:01:46.200> red

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
gonna do is you're gonna move the red

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.050 
gonna do is you're gonna move the red
doesn't<00:01:47.220> matter<00:01:47.430> which<00:01:47.549> one<00:01:47.729> we'll<00:01:47.880> start

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
doesn't matter which one we'll start

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.270 
doesn't matter which one we'll start
with<00:01:48.149> the<00:01:48.210> red<00:01:48.360> one<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:49.409> red<00:01:49.439> positive<00:01:50.100> cable

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
with the red one the red positive cable

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.980 
with the red one the red positive cable
ends<00:01:50.579> out<00:01:50.790> to<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:52.850> super-<00:01:53.850> bury<00:01:54.420> your<00:01:54.659> go<00:01:54.840> out

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
ends out to the super- bury your go out

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.260 
ends out to the super- bury your go out
to<00:01:55.290> the<00:01:55.380> cable<00:01:55.680> end<00:01:55.829> so<00:01:56.340> we<00:01:56.460> moved<00:01:56.670> out<00:01:56.820> one

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
to the cable end so we moved out one

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.630 
to the cable end so we moved out one
step<00:01:57.570> and<00:01:57.899> we're<00:01:58.439> reading<00:01:58.590> exactly<00:01:59.189> the<00:01:59.430> same

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
step and we're reading exactly the same

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.789 
step and we're reading exactly the same
so<00:02:00.210> what<00:02:00.360> that<00:02:00.509> tells<00:02:00.719> us<00:02:01.020> is<00:02:01.229> there<00:02:01.439> is<00:02:01.590> no

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
so what that tells us is there is no

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.249 
so what that tells us is there is no
corrosion<00:02:02.219> there's<00:02:02.820> no<00:02:03.030> loss<00:02:03.270> of<00:02:03.479> power<00:02:03.630> we're

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
corrosion there's no loss of power we're

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:07.370 
corrosion there's no loss of power we're
not<00:02:04.409> losing<00:02:04.619> any<00:02:04.920> voltage<00:02:05.219> between<00:02:05.969> the<00:02:06.810> posts

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
not losing any voltage between the posts

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.940 
not losing any voltage between the posts
and<00:02:07.469> the<00:02:07.560> cable<00:02:08.550> and<00:02:08.869> now<00:02:09.869> we<00:02:09.929> move<00:02:10.470> it<00:02:10.649> back<00:02:10.920> to

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
and the cable and now we move it back to

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.610 
and the cable and now we move it back to
the<00:02:11.250> post<00:02:11.540> and<00:02:12.540> we<00:02:12.840> do<00:02:12.930> the<00:02:13.020> same<00:02:13.260> thing<00:02:13.500> for

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
the post and we do the same thing for

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.940 
the post and we do the same thing for
the<00:02:13.709> name

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
the name

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.520 
the name
Kable<00:02:14.430> you're<00:02:14.790> gonna<00:02:14.910> now<00:02:15.239> touch<00:02:16.080> keep<00:02:16.379> it

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
Kable you're gonna now touch keep it

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.589 
Kable you're gonna now touch keep it
touch<00:02:16.680> the<00:02:16.860> center<00:02:17.160> and<00:02:17.340> then<00:02:17.940> move<00:02:18.150> to<00:02:18.569> the

00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:18.599 
touch the center and then move to the

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:22.460 
touch the center and then move to the
cable<00:02:18.989> end<00:02:19.200> for<00:02:20.129> the<00:02:20.220> battery<00:02:20.519> cable<00:02:21.180> and<00:02:21.470> same

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
cable end for the battery cable and same

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.130 
cable end for the battery cable and same
thing<00:02:22.739> we're<00:02:23.040> at<00:02:23.160> 12:24<00:02:24.030> so<00:02:24.420> again<00:02:24.720> we've<00:02:24.900> lost

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
thing we're at 12:24 so again we've lost

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:29.000 
thing we're at 12:24 so again we've lost
no<00:02:25.530> voltage<00:02:26.099> between<00:02:26.610> the<00:02:27.510> cable<00:02:28.140> end<00:02:28.349> and<00:02:28.620> the

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
no voltage between the cable end and the

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.180 
no voltage between the cable end and the
top<00:02:29.220> post<00:02:29.519> and<00:02:29.879> what<00:02:30.690> you'll<00:02:30.840> find<00:02:30.900> is<00:02:31.530> if<00:02:32.069> you

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
top post and what you'll find is if you

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.430 
top post and what you'll find is if you
have<00:02:32.310> a<00:02:32.340> corroded<00:02:32.790> battery<00:02:32.940> or<00:02:33.390> bad<00:02:33.690> cable<00:02:34.230> end

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
have a corroded battery or bad cable end

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.559 
have a corroded battery or bad cable end
a<00:02:34.739> lot<00:02:35.160> of<00:02:35.220> times<00:02:35.550> you'll<00:02:35.849> have<00:02:35.970> a<00:02:36.030> huge

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:36.569 
a lot of times you'll have a huge

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:39.500 
a lot of times you'll have a huge
voltage<00:02:36.900> change<00:02:37.790> sometimes<00:02:38.790> a<00:02:38.940> couple<00:02:39.090> volts

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
voltage change sometimes a couple volts

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.030 
voltage change sometimes a couple volts
or<00:02:39.599> more<00:02:39.780> and<00:02:39.989> that<00:02:40.019> right<00:02:40.560> there<00:02:40.739> will<00:02:40.860> cause

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
or more and that right there will cause

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.860 
or more and that right there will cause
the<00:02:41.190> vehicle<00:02:41.430> if<00:02:41.489> it's<00:02:41.640> not<00:02:41.760> to<00:02:41.880> start<00:02:42.180> or<00:02:42.450> do

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
the vehicle if it's not to start or do

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.050 
the vehicle if it's not to start or do
all<00:02:42.989> kinds<00:02:43.200> of<00:02:43.230> other<00:02:43.319> funky<00:02:43.620> stuff<00:02:43.910> so<00:02:44.910> now

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
all kinds of other funky stuff so now

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:46.729 
all kinds of other funky stuff so now
the<00:02:45.120> next<00:02:45.299> thing<00:02:45.450> to<00:02:45.569> do<00:02:45.780> is<00:02:45.870> we<00:02:45.989> can<00:02:46.140> move<00:02:46.290> back

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:46.739 
the next thing to do is we can move back

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:49.070 
the next thing to do is we can move back
to<00:02:47.340> the<00:02:47.430> center<00:02:47.610> of<00:02:47.760> the<00:02:47.819> take<00:02:47.970> the<00:02:48.120> post<00:02:48.390> and

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
to the center of the take the post and

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.069 
to the center of the take the post and
we're<00:02:49.290> back<00:02:49.380> to<00:02:49.440> 24<00:02:50.099> and<00:02:50.400> if<00:02:51.030> you<00:02:51.120> want<00:02:51.569> to<00:02:51.840> the

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:52.079 
we're back to 24 and if you want to the

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:54.289 
we're back to 24 and if you want to the
next<00:02:52.470> step<00:02:52.709> is<00:02:52.920> you<00:02:53.130> can<00:02:53.280> take<00:02:53.519> both<00:02:53.790> cable

00:02:54.289 --> 00:02:54.299 
next step is you can take both cable

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:57.559 
next step is you can take both cable
tester<00:02:54.930> ends<00:02:55.230> and<00:02:55.380> move<00:02:55.920> bolt<00:02:56.459> of<00:02:56.670> amount<00:02:56.940> to

00:02:57.559 --> 00:02:57.569 
tester ends and move bolt of amount to

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:00.380 
tester ends and move bolt of amount to
the<00:02:57.690> cable<00:02:58.049> ends<00:02:58.319> and<00:02:58.940> again<00:02:59.940> there<00:03:00.209> we<00:03:00.360> are

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
the cable ends and again there we are

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.330 
the cable ends and again there we are
the<00:03:00.599> same<00:03:00.810> so<00:03:01.349> at<00:03:01.530> this<00:03:01.680> point<00:03:01.950> we've<00:03:02.160> now

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
the same so at this point we've now

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:03.979 
the same so at this point we've now
hundred-percent<00:03:03.000> verified<00:03:03.540> there's<00:03:03.810> no

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
hundred-percent verified there's no

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:06.650 
hundred-percent verified there's no
break<00:03:04.349> between<00:03:04.380> either<00:03:05.099> of<00:03:05.640> the<00:03:06.120> cable<00:03:06.480> ends

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
break between either of the cable ends

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:10.789 
break between either of the cable ends
or<00:03:06.989> the<00:03:07.049> top<00:03:07.470> post<00:03:07.799> so<00:03:08.549> we<00:03:08.819> now<00:03:09.180> verify<00:03:09.870> with

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:10.799 
or the top post so we now verify with

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:12.949 
or the top post so we now verify with
you<00:03:11.280> know<00:03:11.340> pretty<00:03:11.610> good<00:03:12.209> certainty<00:03:12.420> that<00:03:12.840> the

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
you know pretty good certainty that the

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:15.350 
you know pretty good certainty that the
battery<00:03:13.260> is<00:03:13.410> good<00:03:13.650> the<00:03:14.610> only<00:03:14.760> other<00:03:15.060> thing<00:03:15.239> you

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
battery is good the only other thing you

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:18.170 
battery is good the only other thing you
could<00:03:15.510> do<00:03:15.660> to<00:03:16.019> make<00:03:16.349> this<00:03:16.560> test<00:03:16.829> a<00:03:16.980> little<00:03:17.180> more

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
could do to make this test a little more

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.660 
could do to make this test a little more
positive<00:03:19.139> would<00:03:19.680> be<00:03:19.859> if<00:03:20.010> you<00:03:20.100> had<00:03:20.220> a<00:03:20.250> second

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
positive would be if you had a second

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:22.250 
positive would be if you had a second
person<00:03:21.090> you<00:03:21.540> could<00:03:21.690> have<00:03:21.780> somebody<00:03:21.989> try<00:03:22.200> to

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
person you could have somebody try to

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.800 
person you could have somebody try to
crank<00:03:22.530> the<00:03:22.799> engine<00:03:23.160> over<00:03:23.639> hold<00:03:24.239> the<00:03:24.389> key<00:03:24.600> on

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
crank the engine over hold the key on

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:26.809 
crank the engine over hold the key on
like<00:03:25.350> you're<00:03:25.470> starting<00:03:25.709> the<00:03:25.889> car<00:03:26.100> while

00:03:26.809 --> 00:03:26.819 
like you're starting the car while

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:28.580 
like you're starting the car while
you're<00:03:27.000> doing<00:03:27.299> this<00:03:27.420> test<00:03:27.720> which<00:03:28.260> is<00:03:28.410> going<00:03:28.530> to

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
you're doing this test which is going to

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:30.259 
you're doing this test which is going to
put<00:03:28.769> an<00:03:28.859> excessive<00:03:29.310> draw<00:03:29.549> on<00:03:29.760> the<00:03:29.850> circuit

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:30.269 
put an excessive draw on the circuit

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:31.849 
put an excessive draw on the circuit
like<00:03:30.720> the<00:03:30.870> starter<00:03:31.170> is<00:03:31.230> trying<00:03:31.440> to<00:03:31.500> start<00:03:31.739> it

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:31.859 
like the starter is trying to start it

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:33.830 
like the starter is trying to start it
and<00:03:32.069> it's<00:03:32.549> going<00:03:32.670> to<00:03:32.730> load<00:03:32.970> that<00:03:33.239> circuit<00:03:33.690> and

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
and it's going to load that circuit and

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.289 
and it's going to load that circuit and
draw<00:03:34.350> a<00:03:34.380> ton<00:03:34.680> of<00:03:34.709> power<00:03:34.920> so<00:03:35.639> if<00:03:35.760> you<00:03:35.880> do<00:03:36.090> have<00:03:36.269> a

00:03:36.289 --> 00:03:36.299 
draw a ton of power so if you do have a

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:37.670 
draw a ton of power so if you do have a
break<00:03:36.690> that's<00:03:36.930> like<00:03:37.079> an<00:03:37.170> intermittent

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
break that's like an intermittent

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.309 
break that's like an intermittent
problem<00:03:37.709> or<00:03:38.250> something<00:03:38.940> that's<00:03:39.090> not<00:03:39.209> easy<00:03:40.079> to

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:48.989 
that can help you find problems that may

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:50.930 
that can help you find problems that may
not<00:03:49.200> show<00:03:49.500> up<00:03:49.530> in<00:03:49.799> like<00:03:50.040> a<00:03:50.069> static<00:03:50.519> type<00:03:50.700> test

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 
not show up in like a static type test

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:53.690 
not show up in like a static type test
we<00:03:51.090> call<00:03:51.269> it<00:03:51.420> so<00:03:51.989> as<00:03:52.319> of<00:03:52.769> right<00:03:52.799> now<00:03:52.950> you<00:03:53.639> know

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
we call it so as of right now you know

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.879 
we call it so as of right now you know
the<00:03:53.910> cables<00:03:54.239> check<00:03:54.480> good<00:03:54.720> the<00:03:55.230> battery<00:03:55.590> checks

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:55.889 
the cables check good the battery checks

00:03:55.889 --> 00:03:59.360 
the cables check good the battery checks
good<00:03:57.109> the<00:03:58.109> next<00:03:58.620> step<00:03:58.859> since<00:03:59.069> you're<00:03:59.220> hoping

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
good the next step since you're hoping

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:00.589 
good the next step since you're hoping
your<00:03:59.519> keep<00:03:59.670> your<00:03:59.700> cables<00:04:00.120> and<00:04:00.239> normally<00:04:00.480> go

00:04:00.589 --> 00:04:00.599 
your keep your cables and normally go

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:03.229 
your keep your cables and normally go
through<00:04:00.840> here<00:04:01.170> you<00:04:01.889> could<00:04:02.069> even<00:04:02.280> go<00:04:02.639> out<00:04:02.910> to

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:03.239 
through here you could even go out to

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:05.180 
through here you could even go out to
the<00:04:03.329> cables<00:04:03.720> themselves<00:04:03.950> because<00:04:04.950> these<00:04:05.069> are

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:05.190 
the cables themselves because these are

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:07.160 
the cables themselves because these are
aftermarket<00:04:05.549> style<00:04:06.060> cable<00:04:06.420> ends<00:04:06.569> you<00:04:07.019> can

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170 
aftermarket style cable ends you can

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:09.199 
aftermarket style cable ends you can
have<00:04:07.260> a<00:04:07.290> bad<00:04:07.530> connection<00:04:07.739> here<00:04:08.190> where<00:04:09.000> the

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:09.209 
have a bad connection here where the

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:12.050 
have a bad connection here where the
cables<00:04:09.750> go<00:04:09.930> into<00:04:10.380> the<00:04:10.470> cable<00:04:10.650> end<00:04:10.980> so<00:04:11.549> the<00:04:11.849> next

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
cables go into the cable end so the next

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:13.909 
cables go into the cable end so the next
step<00:04:12.359> you<00:04:12.510> just<00:04:12.540> continue<00:04:12.900> out<00:04:13.169> again<00:04:13.500> keep

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:13.919 
step you just continue out again keep

00:04:13.919 --> 00:04:15.319 
step you just continue out again keep
the<00:04:14.069> one<00:04:14.220> that<00:04:14.310> are<00:04:14.400> negative<00:04:14.790> and<00:04:14.940> then<00:04:15.180> go

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:15.329 
the one that are negative and then go

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:18.229 
the one that are negative and then go
out<00:04:15.510> to<00:04:15.750> your<00:04:16.190> cable<00:04:17.190> end<00:04:17.519> right<00:04:17.760> here<00:04:17.970> if<00:04:18.150> the

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:18.239 
out to your cable end right here if the

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:19.729 
out to your cable end right here if the
cable<00:04:18.539> is<00:04:18.630> coming<00:04:18.840> out<00:04:18.959> and<00:04:19.200> then<00:04:19.500> same<00:04:19.709> thing

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 
cable is coming out and then same thing

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:21.979 
cable is coming out and then same thing
on<00:04:19.950> the<00:04:20.010> other<00:04:20.039> side<00:04:20.220> so<00:04:21.030> that's<00:04:21.539> kind<00:04:21.840> of<00:04:21.870> how

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989 
on the other side so that's kind of how

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:23.899 
on the other side so that's kind of how
you<00:04:22.019> do<00:04:22.380> it's<00:04:22.800> called<00:04:22.950> a<00:04:23.010> voltage<00:04:23.159> drop<00:04:23.490> test

00:04:23.899 --> 00:04:23.909 
you do it's called a voltage drop test

00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:25.570 
you do it's called a voltage drop test
and

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:25.580 
and

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:27.879 
and
if<00:04:25.669> everything<00:04:26.180> passes<00:04:26.659> here<00:04:27.080> the<00:04:27.470> next<00:04:27.710> step

00:04:27.879 --> 00:04:27.889 
if everything passes here the next step

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:30.010 
if everything passes here the next step
would<00:04:28.340> be<00:04:28.400> to<00:04:28.759> check<00:04:28.909> the<00:04:29.360> starter<00:04:29.810> and

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:30.020 
would be to check the starter and

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.350 
would be to check the starter and
there's<00:04:30.650> going<00:04:30.770> to<00:04:30.830> be<00:04:30.889> a<00:04:31.039> single<00:04:31.400> wire<00:04:31.699> going

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:32.360 
there's going to be a single wire going

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:34.659 
there's going to be a single wire going
down<00:04:32.780> to<00:04:33.139> the<00:04:33.289> starter<00:04:33.710> that<00:04:34.129> will<00:04:34.280> come<00:04:34.490> from

00:04:34.659 --> 00:04:34.669 
down to the starter that will come from

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:36.640 
down to the starter that will come from
the<00:04:34.819> key<00:04:35.000> switch<00:04:35.229> it's<00:04:36.229> always<00:04:36.409> going<00:04:36.530> to<00:04:36.590> be

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:36.650 
the key switch it's always going to be

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:39.219 
the key switch it's always going to be
the<00:04:36.770> small<00:04:37.039> wire<00:04:37.280> smallest<00:04:37.939> lawyer<00:04:38.180> and<00:04:38.419> that

00:04:39.219 --> 00:04:39.229 
the small wire smallest lawyer and that

00:04:39.229 --> 00:04:42.369 
the small wire smallest lawyer and that
is<00:04:39.500> the<00:04:39.710> the<00:04:40.159> wire<00:04:40.340> that<00:04:40.610> receives<00:04:41.000> power<00:04:41.379> from

00:04:42.369 --> 00:04:42.379 
is the the wire that receives power from

00:04:42.379 --> 00:04:45.610 
is the the wire that receives power from
the<00:04:42.919> ignition<00:04:43.189> when<00:04:43.849> you<00:04:43.969> crank<00:04:44.270> it<00:04:44.389> and<00:04:44.659> your

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:45.620 
the ignition when you crank it and your

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:47.499 
the ignition when you crank it and your
fat<00:04:45.919> cable<00:04:46.340> on<00:04:46.520> the<00:04:46.610> starter<00:04:46.939> is<00:04:47.090> always<00:04:47.360> your

00:04:47.499 --> 00:04:47.509 
fat cable on the starter is always your

00:04:47.509 --> 00:04:49.659 
fat cable on the starter is always your
battery<00:04:47.870> positive<00:04:48.050> start<00:04:48.800> of<00:04:48.949> battery

00:04:49.659 --> 00:04:49.669 
battery positive start of battery

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:53.379 
battery positive start of battery
positive<00:04:49.939> wire<00:04:50.659> so<00:04:51.669> once<00:04:52.669> you<00:04:52.789> verified<00:04:53.240> this

00:04:53.379 --> 00:04:53.389 
positive wire so once you verified this

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:55.510 
positive wire so once you verified this
is<00:04:53.539> all<00:04:53.689> good<00:04:53.960> you<00:04:54.379> now<00:04:54.560> move<00:04:54.800> on<00:04:54.979> the<00:04:55.129> test<00:04:55.340> and

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:55.520 
is all good you now move on the test and

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.219 
is all good you now move on the test and
your<00:04:55.610> starter<00:04:56.090> to<00:04:56.419> confirm<00:04:56.659> the<00:04:56.780> starter<00:04:57.139> is

00:04:57.219 --> 00:04:57.229 
your starter to confirm the starter is

00:04:57.229 --> 00:05:00.249 
your starter to confirm the starter is
either<00:04:57.379> good<00:04:57.710> or<00:04:57.740> bad<00:04:58.009> and<00:04:58.599> with<00:04:59.599> that<00:04:59.780> that's

00:05:00.249 --> 00:05:00.259 
either good or bad and with that that's

00:05:00.259 --> 00:05:05.710 
either good or bad and with that that's
how<00:05:00.469> you<00:05:00.530> do<00:05:00.949> a<00:05:00.979> battery<00:05:01.879> a<00:05:02.090> voltage<00:05:02.719> drop<00:05:03.259> test
