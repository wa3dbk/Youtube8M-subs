but what sets yours apart from others um

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:21.380 
but what sets yours apart from others um
well<00:02:16.620> I<00:02:17.270> guess<00:02:18.270> I<00:02:18.600> actually<00:02:18.990> have<00:02:19.380> a<00:02:20.250> bit<00:02:21.030> of<00:02:21.060> an

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
well I guess I actually have a bit of an

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.870 
well I guess I actually have a bit of an
affinity<00:02:21.810> to<00:02:22.290> the<00:02:22.860> Middle<00:02:23.130> East<00:02:23.310> and<00:02:23.610> I've<00:02:23.760> got

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
affinity to the Middle East and I've got

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.460 
affinity to the Middle East and I've got
a<00:02:23.910> massive<00:02:24.210> middle-eastern<00:02:24.990> following

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
a massive middle-eastern following

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.130 
a massive middle-eastern following
actually<00:02:25.650> and<00:02:26.160> so<00:02:26.280> I<00:02:26.310> do<00:02:26.460> hijab<00:02:27.270> tutorials<00:02:27.900> and

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
actually and so I do hijab tutorials and

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.650 
actually and so I do hijab tutorials and
other<00:02:28.260> sort<00:02:29.220> of<00:02:29.280> tutorials<00:02:30.030> directed<00:02:30.390> at<00:02:30.510> them

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
other sort of tutorials directed at them

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.840 
other sort of tutorials directed at them
so<00:02:31.020> I<00:02:31.290> guess<00:02:31.770> that's<00:02:32.040> really<00:02:32.220> what<00:02:32.430> sets<00:02:32.670> me

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
so I guess that's really what sets me

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:34.730 
so I guess that's really what sets me
apart<00:02:32.880> I'm<00:02:33.540> very<00:02:33.690> passionate<00:02:33.870> about<00:02:34.200> that<00:02:34.500> and

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:34.740 
apart I'm very passionate about that and

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:37.070 
apart I'm very passionate about that and
proud<00:02:34.980> of<00:02:35.130> that<00:02:35.250> so<00:02:35.820> that's<00:02:36.480> probably<00:02:36.750> one

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
proud of that so that's probably one

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:38.300 
proud of that so that's probably one
thing<00:02:37.290> that<00:02:37.470> really<00:02:37.590> sets<00:02:37.890> me<00:02:37.950> apart<00:02:38.040> from

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
thing that really sets me apart from

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:39.650 
thing that really sets me apart from
other<00:02:38.490> people<00:02:38.880> did<00:02:39.060> you<00:02:39.150> have<00:02:39.270> to<00:02:39.360> do<00:02:39.480> some

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
think if you go up the cheekbone it's

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:42.320 
think if you go up the cheekbone it's
gonna<00:03:40.380> highlight<00:03:40.710> that<00:03:41.010> shape<00:03:41.370> and<00:03:41.610> if<00:03:42.060> you<00:03:42.150> go

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:42.330 
gonna highlight that shape and if you go

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:44.450 
gonna highlight that shape and if you go
over<00:03:42.780> the<00:03:42.930> apples<00:03:43.800> will<00:03:44.040> just<00:03:44.220> give<00:03:44.340> you<00:03:44.400> a

00:05:07.159 --> 00:05:07.169 
the angles how do you do that yeah I

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:09.379 
the angles how do you do that yeah I
mean<00:05:07.470> it's<00:05:07.650> hard<00:05:07.860> if<00:05:08.009> you<00:05:08.130> want<00:05:08.820> like<00:05:09.120> a<00:05:09.150> high

00:05:09.379 --> 00:05:09.389 
mean it's hard if you want like a high

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:10.939 
mean it's hard if you want like a high
arch<00:05:09.660> and<00:05:09.870> you<00:05:09.900> just<00:05:10.080> don't<00:05:10.199> have<00:05:10.320> hair<00:05:10.680> there

00:05:10.939 --> 00:05:10.949 
arch and you just don't have hair there

00:05:10.949 --> 00:05:13.129 
arch and you just don't have hair there
but<00:05:11.160> I<00:05:11.550> guess<00:05:11.789> I<00:05:12.030> just<00:05:12.419> think<00:05:12.810> you<00:05:12.870> should<00:05:12.900> go

00:05:13.129 --> 00:05:13.139 
but I guess I just think you should go

00:05:13.139 --> 00:05:15.620 
but I guess I just think you should go
with<00:05:13.289> your<00:05:13.380> natural<00:05:13.860> shape<00:05:14.370> yeah<00:05:14.910> just<00:05:15.479> let

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:15.630 
with your natural shape yeah just let

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:17.779 
with your natural shape yeah just let
them<00:05:15.810> fully<00:05:16.080> grow<00:05:16.259> out<00:05:16.470> and<00:05:16.740> probably<00:05:16.949> go<00:05:17.310> to<00:05:17.370> a

00:05:17.779 --> 00:05:17.789 
them fully grow out and probably go to a

00:05:17.789 --> 00:05:19.610 
them fully grow out and probably go to a
professional<00:05:18.270> to<00:05:18.659> do<00:05:18.810> it<00:05:18.930> maybe<00:05:19.110> don't<00:05:19.380> try<00:05:19.560> to
