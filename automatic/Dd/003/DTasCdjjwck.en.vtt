00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.070 
firm though you've got two choices here

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:08.420 
firm though you've got two choices here
you<00:03:05.340> can<00:03:05.549> ebert<00:03:06.230> flour<00:03:07.230> surface<00:03:07.860> roller<00:03:08.190> out

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
you can ebert flour surface roller out

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:12.410 
you can ebert flour surface roller out
and<00:03:08.820> use<00:03:09.780> a<00:03:09.810> cookie<00:03:10.260> cutter<00:03:10.670> to<00:03:11.670> create<00:03:12.030> a<00:03:12.180> nice

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420

and use a cookie cutter to create a nice
round<00:03:12.750> skull<00:03:13.080> shapes<00:03:13.530> but<00:03:14.280> I've<00:03:15.150> got<00:03:15.390> enough

00:03:16.039 --> 00:03:16.049 
round skull shapes but I've got enough

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:18.259 
round skull shapes but I've got enough
type<00:03:16.290> that<00:03:16.530> so<00:03:16.799> what<00:03:17.010> I<00:03:17.040> do<00:03:17.370> is<00:03:17.580> I'm<00:03:17.820> gonna<00:03:18.000> just

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269 
type that so what I do is I'm gonna just

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:20.930 
type that so what I do is I'm gonna just

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:26.610 
just going to divide it into this will

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:29.330 
just going to divide it into this will
make<00:03:26.730> roughly<00:03:27.329> eight<00:03:27.660> scones<00:03:28.290> but<00:03:28.739> you<00:03:29.250> know

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:33.950 
bit bigger you don't have to big and

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:36.990 
bit bigger you don't have to big and
then<00:03:34.950> just<00:03:35.390> shape<00:03:36.390> it<00:03:36.600> in
