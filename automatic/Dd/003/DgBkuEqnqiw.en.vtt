00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.449
 after applying the concealer and the 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:05.700
 makeup base we continue 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:07.440
 contouring the face we are going to use a 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.080
 bronzer powder and a brush for 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.269
 blusher cojemos product we remove the 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.450
 excess of the hand and we mark below the 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:17.780
 cheekbone to sink this area and make 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.430
 the cheekbone protrude 

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:22.710
 to enhance this effect we are going to 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.140
 illuminate with a powder illuminator 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.660
 loose and a lucky brush also 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.869
 we take product and apply it in the 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:33.290
 higher points of the face on the temple and 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.290
 the cheekbone 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:37.620
 also in the nasal septum 

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:44.450
 in the arch of the lips 

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:47.060
 and a little on the chin 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:49.760
 to finish with the face we take a 

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:52.240
 pink blusher and we mark it on top of the 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.240
 contour 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:59.130
 in that 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:02.160
 and we are going to continue with the eyes 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:04.710
 as always we prepare the eyelid with 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.510
 a prebase for shadows this is going to do 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.390
 that we do not get folds and that the 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.460
 color of the shadows is more intense with 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.120
 We can distribute the finger itself 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.120
 by all 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:22.380
 so that the shadow is more intense I will 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.750
 to use a silver pencil and I'm going to 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.900
 Apply all over the mobile eyelid to 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.850
 create a base shade 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:33.620
 you can use a cream shadow or 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.620
 even jump systems 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:47.460
 with a brush we will unify the stroke 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:50.829
 so there is no area without shadow 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:53.890
 I'm going to use this palette we start with a 

00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:56.500
 gray more clearly a display with a 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:59.140
 flat brush cojemos product and what 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:02.220
 we apply as always to small touches 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.220
 all over the mobile eyelid 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:10.530
 I prefer to apply less quantity 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:13.140
 and little by little 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.910
 since we can always apply more but 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.390
 if we pass it will be harder to come back 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:17.390
 backward 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:23.740
 with a looser brush we take a 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:26.500
 pink shadow 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:29.120
 we remove the excess to go little by little and 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:31.220
 let's mark the basin 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.580
 always start from the end of 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.650
 eye up 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.450
 so that the intensity stays on 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:39.970
 all abroad 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:42.620
 using this brush apply it if 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:44.750
 blur we have at the same time 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.310
 and so we will not be too strong 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.940
 also by the bottom line of 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:50.960
 tabs 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.960
 towards the center 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:57.440
 now with a beveled brush I'm going to take 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:00.920
 a shadow clarita in this case also 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:04.450
 It has a pink hue and we apply it 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.450
 under the arch of the eyebrows 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:08.579
 with this brush and this shadow too 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:11.189
 we will help so that there is no 

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:13.639
 cut between dark pink and this pink 

00:03:11.189 --> 00:03:13.639
 clarito 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:24.060
 also we apply to the lacrimal 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:25.890
 illuminate the look 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:28.110
 now let's take a gray shadow 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:31.560
 dark black the tone that you 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:33.840
 you want to take product we remove excess 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:37.380
 and we're going to mark the basin but a little 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:39.599
 more inland under the pink of 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:43.260
 this way we will make the look more 

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:47.280
 marked deeper and we will make a 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:49.860
 degraded gray silver darker towards 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:52.130
 pink applying it on top of the rose 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:55.700
 there will be a purple tone 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:57.500
 and at the end that will give the rose 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:59.560
 since we're not going to get to the 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:03.130
 outside of the top 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:04.750
 also in the lower lashes we're going 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:07.620
 to illuminate 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:11.140
 in the water line with a clear pencil 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:13.840
 we will apply a test for pigment 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:15.580
 since we are going to apply a pigment 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:18.549
 silver to mark more the shadow 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:20.230
 silver this step also if you want 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:22.600
 You can skip it, it's just for 

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:26.260
 give more importance to the look more 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:29.260
 shine on these dates that you have to 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:33.630
 take advantage if you want to apply things 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:33.630
 bright is the season to do it 

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:38.570
 and as always the pigment I like 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:40.880
 Apply it to little touches so you do not 

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:43.600
 we fall in the face and we stain 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:43.600
 our foundation 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:54.740
 in that year 

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:57.160
 we apply a very finite eyeliner if 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:59.570
 you want to make a small revilla 

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:03.569
 we continue with the eyebrows I always 

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:05.849
 like to comb the before filling the 

00:05:03.569 --> 00:05:07.710
 with a pencil or with shadow with what 

00:05:05.849 --> 00:05:10.559
 you manage better we are going to 

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:14.059
 small little holes and fill me 

00:05:10.559 --> 00:05:14.059
 like to extend a little 

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:22.290
 again we comb it back so that 

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:25.250
 do not remain artificial and we fix them with 

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:25.250
 a transparent gel 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:36.020
 we apply two layers of mask 

00:05:32.389 --> 00:05:39.729
 tabs starting at the root for 

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:39.729
 lift them and curl 

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:46.620
 go turning the bull towards the tips 

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:53.290
 On the lips I have chosen a nude tone 

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:56.570
 since the eyes are quite marked 

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:59.240
 this is a natural tone that pulls a little 

00:05:56.570 --> 00:06:01.039
 towards rosa 

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:02.870
 but I wanted to put a little bit of 

00:06:01.039 --> 00:06:05.030
 shine and darken it a bit then 

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:07.880
 I have chosen a shine that pulls purple 

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:11.169
 to give you that more juiciness and a 

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:11.169
 little more of darkness 

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:17.240
 and nothing is that it would be the makeup 

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:20.710
 I hope you liked it and 

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:20.710
 See you next time
