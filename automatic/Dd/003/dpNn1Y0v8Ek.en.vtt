00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:08.380
 this sound says more than a thousand words 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:16.160
 He is back the reissue of the Audi R8 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.140
 The city of Ingolstadt is already visually appealing 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:21.090
 super athletes sharper than ever 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:24.090
 lightweight and aerodynamic 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.130
 the r8 improves yet again 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:31.710
 We are especially looking forward to the heart 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:33.930
 the 52 liter v10 medium engine despite 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.050
 his super athlete gene gives himself up 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.300
 interior anything but spartan 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:41.309
 Look out from the fine sport leather seats 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:46.079
 we are on audis new virtual cockpit 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:48.570
 a real eye-catcher on the sports steering wheel 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.969
 find buttons for settings 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:54.000
 Chassis engine and gear and 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:56.450
 Of course the start button is our blood pressure 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.450
 increases 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:12.340
 never before has a series of audi been so close to 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:15.429
 racing we notice that already on the 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:17.289
 first meters the r8 is not only 

00:01:15.429 --> 00:01:18.490
 lighter and stiffer but 

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:21.069
 sticks thanks to the advanced 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:24.069
 four-wheel drive xwd even better on the 

00:01:21.069 --> 00:01:26.079
 asphalt the soundscape of the after 

00:01:24.069 --> 00:01:31.149
 is speeds in yawing woman 10 

00:01:26.079 --> 00:01:33.039
 tremendously so much power but also 

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:34.940
 you have to drive out properly 

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:38.430
 already on a race track 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:40.850
 we switch to sports mode and on 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.850
 it's 

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:50.840
 the handling of the r8 is fantastic the 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:56.270
 traction perfect the acceleration 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:58.220
 Brilliant at the end of the day we can 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:02.530
 then still audis new laser due 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:02.530
