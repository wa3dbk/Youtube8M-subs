00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:12.869
 we drive the landrover discovery 4 of the 

00:00:11.369 --> 00:00:15.150
 year of construction 2013 

00:00:12.869 --> 00:00:18.150
 Our test car is powered by a V6 diesel 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.810
 with 256 ps and 600 newton meters 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.820
 driven 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:24.230
 the power transmission takes place on all 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.759
 Four wheels via an eight- speed automatic 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:27.720
 Robustness and variability are his 

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:29.880
 Trademark 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.640
 That's why Landrover focused 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.320
 at the 2013 model year of his discovery 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.720
 on its design comfort 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.640
 we wanted to convince ourselves how 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:40.800
 that feels concrete and went with it 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:44.850
 the three-liter sdv6 diesel on the 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:47.100
 already stretch his outfit black 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.080
 design with striking details in black 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.760
 signals at first sight that 

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:53.270
 here we are with a mixture of luxury 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.130
 and get to master red 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:57.030
 emphasizes the special 

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:59.430
 body shape still striking 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.320
 big black 20 inch from alu den 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:05.160
 also black grille or 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:07.440
 darkened slices the eye-catching 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:09.030
 color combination of bright red and 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:10.240
 Rich black has been formally with us 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.070
 built-in 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:15.189
 inside, we're expecting land rover 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:18.250
 typical flair variable functional and 

00:01:15.189 --> 00:01:20.590
 Beautifully it goes to the finest leather for 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:22.240
 dashboard center console and steering wheel 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.460
 meets rubberized floor mats 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:27.100
 avoid unnecessary stress in everyday life 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:30.070
 the seats of the spacious discovery are 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.780
 extremely comfortable and give good support 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:33.280
 the discovery 4 is on the way 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:35.649
 pure luxury on four wheels 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.119
 thanks to the 256 hp, the car feels 

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:38.740
 not only on the street but also 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:39.880
 with the permanent all-wheel drive in the 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.830
 terrain perfect 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.909
 but unfortunately this one has luxury and this 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:44.979
 fun also its price 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:48.819
 Our model here se equipment 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:51.490
 starts at around 55,000 euros in ride 

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:53.470
 brings that about 2580 kilo heavy 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:57.340
 endangers a demanding three-liter v6 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:02:02.069
 diesel in two versions as tdv6 with 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:04.539
 211 ps or as sdv6 with 256 ps 

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:06.130
 This drove our test car in 

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:07.659
 interact with his 600th 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:09.929
 Newton meters and the precise 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:12.790
 coordinated eight-speed automatic from zf 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:15.010
 decidedly cultured ahead of the 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.900
 specified consumption values â€‹â€‹of around 8.8 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:19.209
 liter diesel to reach 100 kilometers 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.040
 unfortunately we do not have to do a little bit more 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:23.350
 be it especially if you like 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.150
 Faster on the highway when it drives 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:26.049
 The discovery at one does not lack 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.480
 then that's power 

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:31.150
 it is abundant anytime, anywhere 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.829
 This is what makes the big one 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:35.610
 english in the city as well as on 

00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:37.650
 highways and highways always 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.090
 he is well on the road and the 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.520
 Interior noise is kept in 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:44.340
 borders also leaves difficult terrain 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:46.050
 The non-capitulating research ramps 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.670
 and tilt angles of discovery worry 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:49.260
 for that even adventurous 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.030
 Slope or slope with flying colors 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.590
 The land rover can be taken 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:54.570
 Discovery is certainly a vehicle 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:56.370
 that polarizes there are hundreds 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:57.240
 cheaper vehicles but only a few 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.650
 make more fun 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:00.240
 He brings us everywhere and sees 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.980
 but damn good especially 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:04.140
 as well as you stand here with the black 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:06.590
 design package under color red us 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.590
 like it
