aliens<00:00:10.219> look<00:00:11.219> at<00:00:11.340> this<00:00:11.460> it's<00:00:12.120> a<00:00:12.269> steering

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
aliens look at this it's a steering

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:14.690 
aliens look at this it's a steering
wheel<00:00:12.630> from<00:00:13.019> a<00:00:13.110> Silver<00:00:13.500> Arrow<00:00:13.530> from<00:00:13.860> the<00:00:13.920> 1950s

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
wheel from a Silver Arrow from the 1950s

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.090 
wheel from a Silver Arrow from the 1950s
it's<00:00:15.179> a<00:00:15.299> perfect<00:00:15.690> circle<00:00:15.900> with<00:00:16.139> no<00:00:16.470> buttons<00:00:16.890> to

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
it's a perfect circle with no buttons to

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.800 
it's a perfect circle with no buttons to
push<00:00:17.279> since<00:00:17.789> it<00:00:17.910> only<00:00:18.000> had<00:00:18.180> one<00:00:18.210> function

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
push since it only had one function

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.859 
push since it only had one function
which<00:00:19.320> is<00:00:19.350> to<00:00:19.470> steer<00:00:19.800> the<00:00:19.830> car

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:22.869 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:24.880 

nowadays<00:00:23.869> my<00:00:24.079> steering<00:00:24.380> wheel<00:00:24.410> looks<00:00:24.710> a<00:00:24.800> bit

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:24.890 
nowadays my steering wheel looks a bit

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:27.599 
nowadays my steering wheel looks a bit
different<00:00:25.060> this<00:00:26.060> is<00:00:26.210> it<00:00:26.359> right<00:00:26.509> here<00:00:26.570> and

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:27.609 
different this is it right here and

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:30.429 
different this is it right here and
there's<00:00:28.609> more<00:00:28.910> than<00:00:29.089> 20<00:00:29.630> buttons<00:00:29.989> on<00:00:30.140> there<00:00:30.259> to

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:30.439 
there's more than 20 buttons on there to

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:32.019 
there's more than 20 buttons on there to
push<00:00:30.649> but<00:00:31.099> to<00:00:31.279> be<00:00:31.340> honest<00:00:31.550> if<00:00:31.669> you<00:00:31.699> look<00:00:31.880> on<00:00:32.000> a

00:00:32.019 --> 00:00:32.029 
push but to be honest if you look on a

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:33.340 
push but to be honest if you look on a
road<00:00:32.239> car<00:00:32.480> they're<00:00:32.750> getting<00:00:33.019> more<00:00:33.199> and<00:00:33.290> more

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:33.350 
road car they're getting more and more

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:38.430 
road car they're getting more and more
functions<00:00:33.860> integrated<00:00:34.399> into<00:00:34.610> the<00:00:34.730> wheel<00:00:34.879> too

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:38.440 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.899 

it's<00:00:39.440> just<00:00:39.620> clever<00:00:39.860> thinking<00:00:40.190> because<00:00:40.790> it

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:40.909 
it's just clever thinking because it

00:00:40.909 --> 00:00:42.880 
it's just clever thinking because it
makes<00:00:41.030> it<00:00:41.239> safer<00:00:41.600> and<00:00:41.629> easier<00:00:42.019> to<00:00:42.379> handle<00:00:42.530> it

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:42.890 
makes it safer and easier to handle it

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.040 
makes it safer and easier to handle it
means<00:00:43.220> your<00:00:43.399> eyes<00:00:43.579> stay<00:00:43.879> on<00:00:44.059> the<00:00:44.300> road<00:00:44.479> at<00:00:44.690> all

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:45.050 
means your eyes stay on the road at all

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:50.389 
means your eyes stay on the road at all
times

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.799 

but<00:00:51.399> while<00:00:51.579> it<00:00:51.700> may<00:00:51.879> have<00:00:52.090> all<00:00:52.360> these<00:00:52.540> gadgets

00:00:52.799 --> 00:00:52.809 
but while it may have all these gadgets

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:55.139 
but while it may have all these gadgets
and<00:00:53.170> gizmos<00:00:53.379> on<00:00:53.739> it<00:00:53.920> there's<00:00:54.550> one<00:00:54.640> safety

00:00:55.139 --> 00:00:55.149 
and gizmos on it there's one safety

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:57.420 
and gizmos on it there's one safety
system<00:00:55.629> a<00:00:55.809> road<00:00:56.050> car<00:00:56.260> has<00:00:56.440> that<00:00:56.920> is<00:00:57.040> missing<00:00:57.340> on

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:57.430 
system a road car has that is missing on

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:00.360 
system a road car has that is missing on
here<00:00:57.670> which<00:00:58.149> is<00:00:58.300> an<00:00:58.420> airbag<00:00:58.780> an<00:00:59.110> f1<00:00:59.920> we<00:01:00.190> just

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:00.370 
here which is an airbag an f1 we just

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:01.619 
here which is an airbag an f1 we just
couldn't<00:01:00.670> fit<00:01:00.850> one<00:01:01.000> inside<00:01:01.300> the<00:01:01.449> tiny

00:01:01.619 --> 00:01:01.629 
couldn't fit one inside the tiny

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:03.330 
couldn't fit one inside the tiny
steering<00:01:02.050> wheel<00:01:02.199> and<00:01:02.350> the<00:01:02.739> wheel<00:01:02.890> has<00:01:03.070> to<00:01:03.190> be

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:03.340 
steering wheel and the wheel has to be

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:05.130 
steering wheel and the wheel has to be
removable<00:01:03.910> so<00:01:04.390> that<00:01:04.540> I<00:01:04.570> can<00:01:04.629> get<00:01:04.839> out<00:01:04.930> of<00:01:04.989> the

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:05.140 
removable so that I can get out of the

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:07.499 
removable so that I can get out of the
car<00:01:05.350> in<00:01:05.560> a<00:01:05.650> couple<00:01:05.979> of<00:01:06.040> seconds<00:01:06.520> in<00:01:06.700> emergency

00:01:07.499 --> 00:01:07.509 
car in a couple of seconds in emergency

00:01:07.509 --> 00:01:09.300 
car in a couple of seconds in emergency
so<00:01:07.930> it<00:01:07.990> will<00:01:08.110> be<00:01:08.140> tough<00:01:08.380> to<00:01:08.440> design<00:01:08.860> an<00:01:08.979> airbag

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:09.310 
so it will be tough to design an airbag

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:11.609 
so it will be tough to design an airbag
to<00:01:09.610> allow<00:01:09.820> that<00:01:09.880> instead<00:01:10.869> innovative

00:01:11.609 --> 00:01:11.619 
to allow that instead innovative

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:13.230 
to allow that instead innovative
thinking<00:01:11.979> led<00:01:12.190> to<00:01:12.310> the<00:01:12.369> development<00:01:12.550> of<00:01:13.090> the

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:13.240 
thinking led to the development of the

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.060 
thinking led to the development of the
head<00:01:13.450> and<00:01:13.630> neck<00:01:13.720> support<00:01:14.140> system<00:01:14.530> or<00:01:14.710> hands
