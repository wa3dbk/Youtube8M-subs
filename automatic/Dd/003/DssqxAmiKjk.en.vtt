00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:42.340 
the dream before we get to end meeting I

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:45.080 
the dream before we get to end meeting I
thought<00:00:42.910> it'd<00:00:43.059> be<00:00:43.090> a<00:00:43.210> good<00:00:43.329> idea<00:00:43.480> just<00:00:43.750> kind<00:00:44.260> of

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
thought it'd be a good idea just kind of

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.209 
thought it'd be a good idea just kind of
show<00:00:46.090> you<00:00:46.149> how<00:00:46.270> it<00:00:46.540> works<00:00:46.660> a<00:00:46.930> little<00:00:47.050> bit<00:00:47.320> house

00:00:48.209 --> 00:00:48.219 
show you how it works a little bit house

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:50.370 
show you how it works a little bit house
what<00:00:48.820> what<00:00:49.149> stop-motion<00:00:49.780> is<00:00:49.840> like<00:00:50.020> just<00:00:50.260> to

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:50.380 
what what stop-motion is like just to

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:54.530 
what what stop-motion is like just to
show<00:00:50.590> you<00:00:50.649> how<00:00:51.780> absolutely<00:00:53.070> exciting<00:00:54.070> and

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:54.540 
show you how absolutely exciting and

00:00:54.540 --> 00:01:02.130 
show you how absolutely exciting and
irresistible<00:00:55.800> this<00:00:56.800> art<00:00:57.190> is

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:02.140 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:06.870 

so<00:01:02.820> stop<00:01:03.820> motion<00:01:04.269> is<00:01:04.420> basically<00:01:04.780> just<00:01:05.520> a<00:01:06.520> bunch

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:06.880 
so stop motion is basically just a bunch

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.660 
so stop motion is basically just a bunch
of<00:01:07.299> pictures<00:01:07.720> played<00:01:08.409> really<00:01:08.830> fast<00:01:09.100> and<00:01:09.460> it

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:09.670 
of pictures played really fast and it

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:12.240 
of pictures played really fast and it
gives<00:01:09.939> the<00:01:10.119> illusion<00:01:10.240> of<00:01:10.659> movement<00:01:10.920> so<00:01:11.920> in<00:01:12.100> my

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:12.250 
gives the illusion of movement so in my

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.139 
gives the illusion of movement so in my
case<00:01:12.640> I<00:01:13.540> am<00:01:13.960> meet<00:01:14.409> at<00:01:14.680> 15<00:01:15.250> frames<00:01:15.430> per<00:01:15.729> second

00:01:16.139 --> 00:01:16.149 
case I am meet at 15 frames per second

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:22.249 
case I am meet at 15 frames per second
so<00:01:18.509> for<00:01:19.509> every<00:01:19.720> second<00:01:20.110> of<00:01:20.170> animation<00:01:20.289> there's

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
so for every second of animation there's

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.820 
so for every second of animation there's
as<00:01:23.259> you<00:01:23.500> can<00:01:23.649> see<00:01:23.860> we<00:01:24.580> have<00:01:24.759> our<00:01:24.970> guy<00:01:25.180> here<00:01:25.830> and

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:26.830 
as you can see we have our guy here and

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:29.370 
as you can see we have our guy here and
let's<00:01:27.340> just<00:01:27.460> say<00:01:27.789> this<00:01:27.970> is<00:01:28.119> your<00:01:28.240> shot<00:01:28.509> right

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:29.380 
let's just say this is your shot right

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.749 
let's just say this is your shot right
here<00:01:30.030> you're<00:01:31.030> gonna<00:01:31.179> start<00:01:31.600> out<00:01:31.750> and<00:01:32.759> let's

00:01:33.749 --> 00:01:33.759 
here you're gonna start out and let's

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:35.100 
here you're gonna start out and let's
say<00:01:33.939> for<00:01:34.119> example<00:01:34.149> you<00:01:34.509> want<00:01:34.659> the<00:01:34.720> guy<00:01:34.840> to<00:01:34.899> bow

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:35.110 
say for example you want the guy to bow

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:37.919 
say for example you want the guy to bow
that's<00:01:35.470> what<00:01:35.619> we'll<00:01:35.770> do<00:01:36.179> you<00:01:37.179> start<00:01:37.600> out<00:01:37.750> you

00:01:37.919 --> 00:01:37.929 
that's what we'll do you start out you

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:41.820 
that's what we'll do you start out you
take<00:01:38.170> an<00:01:38.470> initial<00:01:38.830> picture<00:01:40.319> picture<00:01:41.319> taken

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:41.830 
take an initial picture picture taken

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:47.340 
take an initial picture picture taken
and<00:01:42.580> then<00:01:43.140> you<00:01:44.140> go<00:01:44.289> in<00:01:44.590> with<00:01:44.830> your<00:01:44.979> hand<00:01:46.350> move

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:47.350 
and then you go in with your hand move

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:53.160 
and then you go in with your hand move
them<00:01:47.619> ever<00:01:47.890> so<00:01:48.220> slightly<00:01:50.069> like<00:01:51.069> so<00:01:52.170> take

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.170 
them ever so slightly like so take

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:58.440 
them ever so slightly like so take
another<00:01:53.470> picture<00:01:54.899> go<00:01:55.899> in<00:01:56.140> again<00:01:57.330> don't<00:01:58.330> ever

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:58.450 
another picture go in again don't ever

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:04.889 
another picture go in again don't ever
so<00:01:58.810> slightly<00:02:02.939> you<00:02:03.939> might<00:02:04.179> be<00:02:04.390> able<00:02:04.600> to<00:02:04.689> start

00:02:04.889 --> 00:02:04.899 
so slightly you might be able to start

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:17.470 
so slightly you might be able to start
recognizing<00:02:05.020> a<00:02:05.590> pattern<00:02:06.099> by<00:02:06.280> now

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.250
