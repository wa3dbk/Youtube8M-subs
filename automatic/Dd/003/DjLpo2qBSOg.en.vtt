00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
row together and the reason I'm doing it

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.709 
row together and the reason I'm doing it
this<00:01:46.799> way<00:01:46.859> instead<00:01:47.280> of<00:01:47.459> lining<00:01:47.759> it<00:01:47.969> up<00:01:48.090> like<00:01:48.600> I

00:01:48.709 --> 00:01:48.719 
this way instead of lining it up like I

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:52.870 
this way instead of lining it up like I
usually<00:01:49.109> do<00:01:49.319> in<00:01:50.179> columns<00:01:51.179> is<00:01:51.780> because<00:01:52.200> this<00:01:52.439> is

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:52.880 
usually do in columns is because this is

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:58.309 
usually do in columns is because this is
doesn't<00:01:53.880> line<00:01:54.149> up<00:01:54.649> so<00:01:56.569> I'll<00:01:57.569> go<00:01:57.810> ahead

00:01:58.309 --> 00:01:58.319 
doesn't line up so I'll go ahead

00:01:58.319 --> 00:02:00.789 
doesn't line up so I'll go ahead
