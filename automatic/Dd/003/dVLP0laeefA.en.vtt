 welcome to the raw cup in edition 

00:00:36.039 --> 00:00:40.149
 2015 this afternoon the beginning of the 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:42.850
 group stage of this cup 

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:44.829
 intercollegiate that unites 70 teams of 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:46.719
 different night schools over 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:49.479
 500 players are going to be fighting 

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:51.579
 during nine dates the pass to the 

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:53.199
 playoffs of this cup and see who 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:56.079
 raise the cup of this new edition 

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:57.820
 without further ado my name is samir and 

00:00:56.079 --> 00:01:01.559
 we are going to show you how this cup looks 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.559
 from inside and this starts like this 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.440
 and here 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:17.070
 with new with current goal scorer 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.420
 of the cup shared April 2014 fought 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.490
 harder than we expected 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.710
 we knew wanted in a couple of players 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.860
 who really performed, we would be 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:28.560
 prepared for what you could get to 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.970
 pass and with egg and with fire and with 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.120
 We went ahead and we could 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.120
 win 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:38.760
 I think we complement each other very well what 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:42.950
 enter with the companions and that and that and 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:42.950
 with that we managed to get the result 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:55.109
 We knew how to handle well and we see na 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.789
 share the truth difficult because they 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:06.509
 they sang well apart from a couple of 

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:08.940
 mistakes we had but the two 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:11.720
 shifts I now forward playing by 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.720
 luck and it was not very good 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:24.930
 match fought for the first 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:30.019
 time we start winning 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:34.219
 then nothing happens but shared 

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:36.319
 fought and the team went well it was 

00:02:34.219 --> 00:02:38.090
 full 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:44.590
 that I call you in team also we 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:44.590
 complicated all the equipment 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:58.750
 when the same way we can today and 

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:01.269
 If we make a mistake, let's fix what 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:03.930
 what we did wrong and for a future like that 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:03.930
 we can win the cup
