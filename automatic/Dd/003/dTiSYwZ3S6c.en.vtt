00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:27.040 
I think the the the in defense of Robin

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:29.670 
I think the the the in defense of Robin
the<00:06:27.790> difference<00:06:28.120> between<00:06:28.270> him<00:06:29.110> and<00:06:29.170> I<00:06:29.380> think

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:29.680 
the difference between him and I think

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:31.020 
the difference between him and I think
other<00:06:29.830> folks<00:06:30.100> is<00:06:30.250> that<00:06:30.280> there's<00:06:30.550> an<00:06:30.640> actual

comic<00:06:45.010> I<00:06:45.130> think<00:06:45.520> if<00:06:45.760> he<00:06:46.180> if<00:06:46.330> he<00:06:46.390> hadn't<00:06:46.990> done

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:47.140 
comic I think if he if he hadn't done

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:49.800 
comic I think if he if he hadn't done
that<00:06:47.200> because<00:06:47.830> I've<00:06:48.010> been<00:06:48.400> his<00:06:48.610> best<00:06:49.390> friend<00:06:49.750> I

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:49.810 
that because I've been his best friend I

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:53.820 
that because I've been his best friend I
mean<00:06:49.960> I<00:06:49.990> was<00:06:50.160> his<00:06:51.180> best<00:06:52.180> best<00:06:52.930> man<00:06:53.140> and<00:06:53.380> I<00:06:53.470> think

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:53.830 
mean I was his best best man and I think

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:56.970 
mean I was his best best man and I think
right<00:06:54.070> I<00:06:54.340> think<00:06:54.490> um<00:06:55.320> I'm<00:06:56.320> a<00:06:56.410> little<00:06:56.500> hurt<00:06:56.800> he

00:06:56.970 --> 00:06:56.980 
right I think um I'm a little hurt he

00:06:56.980 --> 00:06:58.730 
right I think um I'm a little hurt he
never<00:06:57.160> lifted<00:06:57.490> anything<00:06:57.610> in<00:06:57.880> mind<00:06:58.060> that<00:06:58.330> I

00:06:58.730 --> 00:06:58.740 
never lifted anything in mind that I

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:01.020 
never lifted anything in mind that I
think<00:06:59.740> it's<00:06:59.860> exaggerated<00:07:00.490> because<00:07:00.880> I<00:07:00.910> think

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:01.030 
think it's exaggerated because I think

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:02.610 
think it's exaggerated because I think
there's<00:07:01.360> bragging<00:07:01.810> rights<00:07:02.050> with<00:07:02.200> people

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:02.620 
there's bragging rights with people

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:04.260 
there's bragging rights with people
they'd<00:07:02.830> be<00:07:02.980> able<00:07:03.070> to<00:07:03.220> say<00:07:03.430> you<00:07:03.760> know<00:07:03.880> that<00:07:04.120> but

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:04.270 
they'd be able to say you know that but

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:05.850 
they'd be able to say you know that but
I<00:07:04.300> think<00:07:04.540> he<00:07:04.630> did<00:07:04.840> he<00:07:05.050> did<00:07:05.230> the<00:07:05.350> right<00:07:05.530> thing

00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:05.860
