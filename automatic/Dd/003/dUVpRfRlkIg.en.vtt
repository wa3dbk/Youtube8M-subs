this<00:00:06.540> is<00:00:06.689> a<00:00:06.720> pile<00:00:07.049> of<00:00:07.319> mulch<00:00:07.649> that<00:00:08.010> we<00:00:08.160> got<00:00:08.940> free

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
this is a pile of mulch that we got free

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.000 
this is a pile of mulch that we got free
from<00:00:09.599> the<00:00:09.750> county<00:00:10.080> they<00:00:10.440> make<00:00:10.620> this<00:00:10.740> from<00:00:10.920> the

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
from the county they make this from the

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.539 
from the county they make this from the
greenways<00:00:11.400> throughout<00:00:11.849> the<00:00:12.360> region<00:00:12.750> and<00:00:13.549> just

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
greenways throughout the region and just

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:16.700 
greenways throughout the region and just
dumped<00:00:14.850> here<00:00:15.059> and<00:00:15.240> we<00:00:15.750> use<00:00:15.930> it<00:00:16.080> to<00:00:16.170> cover<00:00:16.379> all

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
dumped here and we use it to cover all

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.370 
dumped here and we use it to cover all
of<00:00:16.740> our<00:00:16.980> soil<00:00:17.340> so<00:00:18.060> something<00:00:18.720> really<00:00:19.109> simple

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
of our soil so something really simple

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.849 
of our soil so something really simple
to<00:00:19.560> do<00:00:19.800> also<00:00:20.189> in<00:00:20.310> the<00:00:20.400> garden<00:00:20.789> to<00:00:21.090> remember<00:00:21.449> is

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:21.859 
to do also in the garden to remember is

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:24.290 
to do also in the garden to remember is
cover<00:00:22.859> your<00:00:23.070> soil<00:00:23.339> like<00:00:23.730> it<00:00:23.849> would<00:00:23.999> be<00:00:24.119> in<00:00:24.210> the

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
cover your soil like it would be in the

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.659 
cover your soil like it would be in the
forest<00:00:24.779> or<00:00:25.109> even<00:00:25.320> in<00:00:25.439> the<00:00:25.560> chaparral<00:00:26.159> around

00:00:26.659 --> 00:00:26.669 
forest or even in the chaparral around

00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:28.429 
forest or even in the chaparral around
here<00:00:26.970> there's<00:00:27.150> really<00:00:27.329> no<00:00:27.539> bare<00:00:27.810> soil<00:00:28.169> in

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
here there's really no bare soil in

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.769 
here there's really no bare soil in
nature<00:00:28.800> there's<00:00:29.460> always<00:00:29.640> leaf<00:00:29.880> litter<00:00:30.210> sticks

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
nature there's always leaf litter sticks

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.930 
nature there's always leaf litter sticks
and<00:00:31.109> things<00:00:31.349> it's<00:00:31.919> kind<00:00:32.070> of<00:00:32.189> half<00:00:32.520> breaking

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
and things it's kind of half breaking

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.229 
and things it's kind of half breaking
down<00:00:33.329> and<00:00:33.630> covering<00:00:34.590> the<00:00:34.710> soil<00:00:35.010> protects<00:00:35.940> the

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
down and covering the soil protects the

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:37.639 
down and covering the soil protects the
moisture<00:00:36.720> that's<00:00:36.870> in<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:37.079> soil<00:00:37.350> from

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
moisture that's in the soil from

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.250 
moisture that's in the soil from
evaporating<00:00:38.460> it<00:00:39.090> also<00:00:39.240> keeps<00:00:39.600> all<00:00:39.810> the<00:00:40.020> soil

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
evaporating it also keeps all the soil

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.890 
evaporating it also keeps all the soil
microbes<00:00:40.800> and<00:00:41.010> critters<00:00:41.490> alive<00:00:42.360> that<00:00:42.810> are

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:42.900 
microbes and critters alive that are

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:44.900 
microbes and critters alive that are
down<00:00:43.050> there<00:00:43.200> that<00:00:43.380> help<00:00:43.560> soil<00:00:44.280> stay<00:00:44.460> rich<00:00:44.670> for

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
down there that help soil stay rich for

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.930 
down there that help soil stay rich for
the<00:00:45.000> plants<00:00:45.420> if<00:00:45.960> it<00:00:46.140> gets<00:00:46.290> too<00:00:46.440> hot<00:00:46.680> the<00:00:47.220> mulch

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
the plants if it gets too hot the mulch

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.550 
the plants if it gets too hot the mulch
will<00:00:48.270> moderate<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:48.720> temperature<00:00:48.870> of<00:00:49.440> the

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:49.560 
will moderate the temperature of the

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:51.680 
will moderate the temperature of the
soil<00:00:49.830> too<00:00:50.130> so<00:00:50.730> it<00:00:50.850> keeps<00:00:51.000> the<00:00:51.270> roots<00:00:51.540> from

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
soil too so it keeps the roots from

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.420 
soil too so it keeps the roots from
getting<00:00:51.960> too<00:00:52.110> hot<00:00:52.260> and<00:00:52.500> too<00:00:52.560> cold<00:00:53.040> that<00:00:53.340> we

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
getting too hot and too cold that we

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.110 
getting too hot and too cold that we
sometimes<00:00:53.790> we<00:00:54.150> have<00:00:54.240> around<00:00:54.480> here<00:00:54.750> at<00:00:55.710> night

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:56.120 
sometimes we have around here at night

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:01.730 
sometimes we have around here at night
and<00:00:57.120> if<00:00:58.110> you<00:00:59.010> take<00:00:59.370> a<00:00:59.670> hard<00:01:00.090> compacted<00:01:00.740> clay

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:01.740 
and if you take a hard compacted clay

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:04.819 
and if you take a hard compacted clay
that's<00:01:02.130> really<00:01:02.580> unhealthy<00:01:03.150> and<00:01:03.390> dead<00:01:04.229> soil

00:01:04.819 --> 00:01:04.829 
that's really unhealthy and dead soil

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:06.830 
that's really unhealthy and dead soil
and<00:01:05.129> you<00:01:05.250> put<00:01:05.489> six<00:01:05.759> inches<00:01:06.030> of<00:01:06.090> this<00:01:06.329> mulch<00:01:06.630> on

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
and you put six inches of this mulch on

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.810 
and you put six inches of this mulch on
it<00:01:07.049> leave<00:01:07.619> it<00:01:07.650> there<00:01:07.920> for<00:01:07.950> six<00:01:08.280> months<00:01:08.640> and

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
it leave it there for six months and

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.060 
it leave it there for six months and
that<00:01:09.600> after<00:01:10.020> that<00:01:10.140> six<00:01:10.350> months<00:01:10.710> you'll<00:01:10.980> be

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
that after that six months you'll be

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.530 
that after that six months you'll be
able<00:01:11.220> to<00:01:11.370> stick<00:01:11.550> your<00:01:11.670> hand<00:01:11.909> a<00:01:12.060> few<00:01:12.360> inches

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
able to stick your hand a few inches

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.560 
able to stick your hand a few inches
into<00:01:12.870> that<00:01:13.140> it'll<00:01:13.830> have<00:01:14.010> life<00:01:14.400> breathed<00:01:15.210> back

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
into that it'll have life breathed back

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.200 
into that it'll have life breathed back
into<00:01:16.050> it<00:01:16.230> just<00:01:16.890> keeping<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.310> moisture<00:01:18.000> in<00:01:18.030> a

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
into it just keeping the moisture in a

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.090 
into it just keeping the moisture in a
little<00:01:18.659> bit<00:01:18.750> of<00:01:18.810> organic<00:01:19.320> matter<00:01:19.500> seeping

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
little bit of organic matter seeping

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.300 
little bit of organic matter seeping
down<00:01:20.840> will<00:01:21.840> create<00:01:22.229> a<00:01:22.260> lot<00:01:22.500> more<00:01:22.530> life<00:01:22.890> it's

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
down will create a lot more life it's

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.219 
down will create a lot more life it's
just<00:01:23.520> makes<00:01:24.120> the<00:01:24.360> soil<00:01:24.510> healthy<00:01:24.960> again<00:01:25.170> and

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
just makes the soil healthy again and

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.320 
just makes the soil healthy again and
makes<00:01:25.530> it<00:01:25.650> better<00:01:25.770> for<00:01:25.890> the<00:01:26.040> plants<00:01:26.430> which<00:01:26.790> can

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
makes it better for the plants which can

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.380 
makes it better for the plants which can
translate<00:01:27.840> to<00:01:28.110> less<00:01:28.950> cost<00:01:29.580> you're<00:01:30.090> not<00:01:30.240> going

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
translate to less cost you're not going

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.180 
translate to less cost you're not going
to<00:01:30.450> be<00:01:30.540> out<00:01:30.720> there<00:01:30.750> having<00:01:31.200> to<00:01:31.320> replace<00:01:31.590> plants

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:32.190 
to be out there having to replace plants

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:33.800 
to be out there having to replace plants
having<00:01:32.460> to<00:01:32.580> fertilize<00:01:33.060> them<00:01:33.300> happy<00:01:33.479> to<00:01:33.570> water

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
having to fertilize them happy to water

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.080 
having to fertilize them happy to water
them<00:01:34.020> as<00:01:34.140> much<00:01:34.350> it<00:01:35.100> really<00:01:35.400> is<00:01:35.610> a<00:01:35.640> holistic

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
them as much it really is a holistic

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.840 
them as much it really is a holistic
method<00:01:36.750> of<00:01:36.870> keeping<00:01:37.020> them<00:01:37.290> healthy<00:01:37.670> so<00:01:38.670> and

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
method of keeping them healthy so and

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.390 
method of keeping them healthy so and
this<00:01:38.940> is<00:01:39.120> really<00:01:39.270> good<00:01:39.570> compost<00:01:40.280> excuse<00:01:41.280> me

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
this is really good compost excuse me

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.660 
this is really good compost excuse me
this<00:01:41.460> is<00:01:41.580> really<00:01:41.760> good<00:01:42.000> mulch<00:01:42.240> here<00:01:43.159> and<00:01:44.159> one

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
this is really good mulch here and one

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.789 
this is really good mulch here and one
of<00:01:44.760> the<00:01:44.850> ways<00:01:44.970> we<00:01:45.150> can<00:01:45.299> tell<00:01:45.600> is<00:01:45.900> that<00:01:45.960> it<00:01:46.530> has

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
of the ways we can tell is that it has

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:52.490 
of the ways we can tell is that it has
this<00:01:47.430> white<00:01:48.080> stuff<00:01:49.080> in<00:01:49.500> it<00:01:50.570> looks<00:01:51.570> like<00:01:51.720> duster

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
this white stuff in it looks like duster

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.580 
this white stuff in it looks like duster
and<00:01:52.880> what<00:01:53.880> they<00:01:54.030> mostly<00:01:54.540> are<00:01:54.750> or<00:01:55.080> fungal

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
and what they mostly are or fungal

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.100 
and what they mostly are or fungal
spores<00:01:56.070> the<00:01:56.400> white<00:01:56.640> is<00:01:56.820> the<00:01:57.119> mycelium<00:01:57.869> that

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
spores the white is the mycelium that

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.640 
spores the white is the mycelium that
little<00:01:58.320> hair<00:01:58.770> hair<00:01:59.580> like<00:01:59.820> network<00:02:00.390> of<00:02:00.650> the

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
work together the plant will get

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.950 
work together the plant will get
nitrogen<00:02:53.470> from<00:02:54.280> and<00:02:54.610> water<00:02:55.210> from<00:02:55.630> and<00:02:55.870> other

nutrients from the fungus and the fungus
will<00:02:58.540> get<00:02:58.720> sugars<00:02:59.530> from<00:02:59.710> the<00:02:59.890> plant<00:03:00.160> so<00:03:00.880> it's

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
will get sugars from the plant so it's

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:02.640 
will get sugars from the plant so it's
good<00:03:01.210> to<00:03:01.240> have<00:03:01.480> the<00:03:01.690> fungus<00:03:02.080> in<00:03:02.260> there<00:03:02.440> for

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
good to have the fungus in there for

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.310 
good to have the fungus in there for
that<00:03:02.800> reason<00:03:03.040> too<00:03:03.610> but<00:03:04.360> the<00:03:04.600> fungi<00:03:05.080> are<00:03:05.200> the

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:05.320 
that reason too but the fungi are the

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:07.110 
that reason too but the fungi are the
ones<00:03:05.530> that<00:03:05.680> are<00:03:05.920> doing<00:03:06.520> a<00:03:06.610> lot<00:03:06.820> of<00:03:06.880> the

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
ones that are doing a lot of the

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.610 
ones that are doing a lot of the
decomposition<00:03:07.990> they're<00:03:08.140> taking<00:03:08.500> these

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
decomposition they're taking these

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:10.110 
decomposition they're taking these
sticks<00:03:09.010> and<00:03:09.340> leaves<00:03:09.520> that<00:03:09.880> aren't<00:03:10.030> really

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120 
sticks and leaves that aren't really

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.600 
sticks and leaves that aren't really
broken<00:03:10.450> down<00:03:10.780> a<00:03:11.050> plant<00:03:11.500> can't<00:03:11.800> the<00:03:12.190> plant<00:03:12.400> root

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:12.610 
broken down a plant can't the plant root

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:14.910 
broken down a plant can't the plant root
can't<00:03:12.910> suck<00:03:13.210> up<00:03:13.390> a<00:03:13.510> stick<00:03:13.780> to<00:03:14.230> get<00:03:14.410> nutrients

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920 
can't suck up a stick to get nutrients

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:16.050 
can't suck up a stick to get nutrients
it<00:03:15.040> has<00:03:15.160> to<00:03:15.280> be<00:03:15.370> broken<00:03:15.550> down<00:03:15.730> to<00:03:15.970> the

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
it has to be broken down to the

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:19.350 
it has to be broken down to the
elemental<00:03:16.690> level<00:03:17.070> so<00:03:18.070> the<00:03:18.460> fungus<00:03:18.910> is<00:03:19.120> the

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:19.360 
elemental level so the fungus is the

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:22.350 
elemental level so the fungus is the
thing<00:03:19.540> doing<00:03:20.140> that<00:03:20.410> primarily<00:03:21.400> the<00:03:21.580> bacteria

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:22.360 
thing doing that primarily the bacteria

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:24.300 
thing doing that primarily the bacteria
too<00:03:22.570> but<00:03:22.810> the<00:03:22.900> fungus<00:03:23.290> does<00:03:23.470> it<00:03:23.590> even<00:03:23.800> more<00:03:24.040> so

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.310 
too but the fungus does it even more so

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:28.430 
too but the fungus does it even more so
so<00:03:24.580> this<00:03:24.850> is<00:03:25.060> good<00:03:25.450> adding<00:03:26.230> this<00:03:26.350> on<00:03:26.560> top<00:03:26.830> will

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
so this is good adding this on top will

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:32.580 
so this is good adding this on top will
really<00:03:29.440> just<00:03:29.470> be<00:03:30.010> a<00:03:30.990> little<00:03:31.990> bit<00:03:32.200> of<00:03:32.290> a<00:03:32.350> silver

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
really just be a little bit of a silver

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:34.320 
really just be a little bit of a silver
bullet<00:03:32.950> you<00:03:33.400> know<00:03:33.550> for<00:03:33.820> taking<00:03:34.060> care<00:03:34.180> of<00:03:34.210> your

bullet you know for taking care of your
garden<00:03:34.690> and<00:03:34.810> you<00:03:34.930> can<00:03:35.080> do<00:03:35.230> it<00:03:35.410> in<00:03:35.950> it<00:03:36.130> in<00:03:36.490> a<00:03:36.580> low

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:37.420 
garden and you can do it in it in a low

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:40.650 
garden and you can do it in it in a low
intensity<00:03:38.200> kind<00:03:38.680> of<00:03:38.800> lazy<00:03:39.310> way<00:03:39.640> just<00:03:39.970> put<00:03:40.180> keep

putting<00:03:40.900> mulch<00:03:41.050> out<00:03:41.260> there<00:03:41.530> and<00:03:41.920> it'll<00:03:42.310> do<00:03:43.300> the

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:43.420 
putting mulch out there and it'll do the

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:46.630 
putting mulch out there and it'll do the
trick

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:46.640 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:48.760 

one<00:03:47.000> thing<00:03:47.360> to<00:03:47.390> remember<00:03:47.540> about<00:03:47.900> mulch<00:03:48.319> it's

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:48.770 
one thing to remember about mulch it's

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:51.040 
one thing to remember about mulch it's
pretty<00:03:49.040> simple<00:03:49.310> to<00:03:49.550> put<00:03:49.670> it<00:03:49.819> out<00:03:49.940> here<00:03:50.000> if<00:03:50.900> you

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:51.050 
pretty simple to put it out here if you

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:54.130 
pretty simple to put it out here if you
want<00:03:51.260> to<00:03:51.580> retain<00:03:52.580> if<00:03:53.420> you<00:03:53.540> want<00:03:53.690> to<00:03:53.750> use<00:03:53.840> mulch

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:54.140 
want to retain if you want to use mulch

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:56.650 
want to retain if you want to use mulch
to<00:03:54.350> keep<00:03:54.590> soil<00:03:55.010> moisture<00:03:55.640> in<00:03:55.819> use<00:03:56.480> at<00:03:56.630> least

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:56.660 
to keep soil moisture in use at least

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:00.309 
to keep soil moisture in use at least
two<00:03:57.110> inches<00:03:57.290> thick<00:03:58.040> of<00:03:58.880> mulch<00:03:59.450> so<00:03:59.720> two<00:03:59.990> inches

00:04:00.309 --> 00:04:00.319 
two inches thick of mulch so two inches

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:03.400 
two inches thick of mulch so two inches
down<00:04:00.530> if<00:04:01.370> you<00:04:01.550> want<00:04:01.700> to<00:04:01.880> use<00:04:02.090> it<00:04:02.120> to<00:04:02.480> suppress

down if you want to use it to suppress
weeds<00:04:03.560> so<00:04:04.490> a<00:04:04.850> weed<00:04:05.720> like<00:04:05.959> this<00:04:06.170> nutsedge<00:04:08.620> if<00:04:09.620> we

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:09.800 
weeds so a weed like this nutsedge if we

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:11.590 
weeds so a weed like this nutsedge if we
pulled<00:04:10.100> it<00:04:10.280> and<00:04:10.430> threw<00:04:10.910> it<00:04:10.940> on<00:04:11.090> the<00:04:11.120> ground<00:04:11.360> we

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:11.600 
pulled it and threw it on the ground we

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:14.110 
pulled it and threw it on the ground we
need<00:04:11.630> at<00:04:11.900> least<00:04:11.930> four<00:04:12.410> inches<00:04:12.470> of<00:04:13.160> mulch<00:04:13.820> on

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:14.120 
need at least four inches of mulch on

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:16.270 
need at least four inches of mulch on
top<00:04:14.180> of<00:04:14.690> that<00:04:14.810> to<00:04:15.380> keep<00:04:15.560> it<00:04:15.680> from<00:04:15.830> reese<00:04:16.040> prowl

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:16.280 
top of that to keep it from reese prowl

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:18.460 
top of that to keep it from reese prowl
ting<00:04:16.489> from<00:04:16.669> this<00:04:16.820> roots<00:04:17.090> so<00:04:17.480> for<00:04:18.290> weed

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:18.470 
ting from this roots so for weed

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:21.490 
ting from this roots so for weed
suppression<00:04:18.820> four<00:04:19.820> or<00:04:20.180> more<00:04:20.480> inches<00:04:20.720> for

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:21.500 
suppression four or more inches for

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:24.820 
suppression four or more inches for
moisture<00:04:22.160> retention<00:04:22.450> two<00:04:23.450> or<00:04:23.780> more<00:04:24.200> inches<00:04:24.410> so

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:24.830 
moisture retention two or more inches so

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:27.909 
moisture retention two or more inches so
I<00:04:25.040> basically<00:04:25.490> just<00:04:25.820> say<00:04:26.600> four<00:04:27.230> inches<00:04:27.620> will<00:04:27.800> do

00:04:27.909 --> 00:04:27.919 
I basically just say four inches will do

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:29.590 
I basically just say four inches will do
the<00:04:28.040> trick<00:04:28.160> for<00:04:28.280> both<00:04:28.610> and<00:04:29.210> that's<00:04:29.390> what<00:04:29.480> we

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:29.600 
the trick for both and that's what we

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.270 
the trick for both and that's what we
put<00:04:29.780> out<00:04:29.810> here<00:04:30.200> but<00:04:30.680> the<00:04:30.740> other<00:04:30.860> little<00:04:31.100> rule

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:31.280 
put out here but the other little rule

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:33.870 
put out here but the other little rule
of<00:04:31.430> thumb<00:04:31.580> is<00:04:31.820> don't<00:04:32.000> have<00:04:32.600> it<00:04:32.900> up<00:04:33.020> against<00:04:33.500> the

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:33.880 
of thumb is don't have it up against the

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:36.850 
of thumb is don't have it up against the
trunk<00:04:34.880> of<00:04:35.060> or<00:04:35.540> the<00:04:35.570> woody<00:04:35.870> part<00:04:35.960> of<00:04:36.470> any<00:04:36.680> kind

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:36.860 
trunk of or the woody part of any kind

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:39.820 
trunk of or the woody part of any kind
of<00:04:36.950> plant<00:04:37.220> perennial<00:04:37.820> tree<00:04:38.050> shrub<00:04:39.050> because

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:39.830 
of plant perennial tree shrub because

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:42.280 
of plant perennial tree shrub because
moisture<00:04:40.250> this<00:04:40.910> is<00:04:41.060> the<00:04:41.180> stem<00:04:41.570> it's<00:04:41.840> not<00:04:41.990> meant

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:42.290 
moisture this is the stem it's not meant

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:43.870 
moisture this is the stem it's not meant
to<00:04:42.380> have<00:04:42.560> moisture<00:04:43.070> next<00:04:43.370> to<00:04:43.490> it<00:04:43.610> it<00:04:43.760> will

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:43.880 
to have moisture next to it it will

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:45.820 
to have moisture next to it it will
start<00:04:44.180> to<00:04:44.240> rot<00:04:44.570> if<00:04:44.840> there's<00:04:45.050> moisture<00:04:45.230> next<00:04:45.740> to

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:45.830 
start to rot if there's moisture next to

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:47.950 
start to rot if there's moisture next to
it<00:04:45.950> so<00:04:46.400> keep<00:04:46.610> it<00:04:46.760> oh<00:04:46.940> we<00:04:47.450> like<00:04:47.600> to<00:04:47.690> say<00:04:47.810> like<00:04:47.930> a

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:47.960 
it so keep it oh we like to say like a

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:51.040 
it so keep it oh we like to say like a
dinner<00:04:48.230> plate-sized<00:04:48.950> or<00:04:49.400> more<00:04:49.730> away<00:04:50.300> from<00:04:50.930> the

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:51.050 
dinner plate-sized or more away from the

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:52.180 
dinner plate-sized or more away from the
trunk<00:04:51.260> of<00:04:51.440> the<00:04:51.500> tree<00:04:51.530> and<00:04:51.740> that's<00:04:51.950> what<00:04:52.100> you're

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:52.190 
trunk of the tree and that's what you're

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:53.710 
trunk of the tree and that's what you're
seeing<00:04:52.400> here<00:04:52.490> so<00:04:52.729> it<00:04:52.850> looks<00:04:53.030> like<00:04:53.210> there's<00:04:53.450> a

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:53.720 
seeing here so it looks like there's a

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:56.290 
seeing here so it looks like there's a
little<00:04:54.110> bit<00:04:54.260> of<00:04:54.320> it<00:04:54.500> the<00:04:54.710> plant<00:04:55.010> is<00:04:55.280> in<00:04:55.790> a<00:04:56.000> dip

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:56.300 
little bit of it the plant is in a dip

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:58.719 
little bit of it the plant is in a dip
like<00:04:56.540> a<00:04:56.600> little<00:04:56.930> shallow<00:04:57.290> basin<00:04:58.040> but<00:04:58.580> that's

00:04:58.719 --> 00:04:58.729 
like a little shallow basin but that's

00:04:58.729 --> 00:05:00.610 
like a little shallow basin but that's
mostly<00:04:58.880> because<00:04:59.090> the<00:04:59.360> mulch<00:04:59.600> is<00:04:59.810> up<00:04:59.960> here<00:05:00.470> and

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:00.620 
mostly because the mulch is up here and

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:02.530 
mostly because the mulch is up here and
then<00:05:00.740> stops<00:05:01.040> and<00:05:01.370> this<00:05:01.790> is<00:05:01.940> the<00:05:02.090> soil<00:05:02.330> level

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:02.540 
then stops and this is the soil level

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:04.600 
then stops and this is the soil level
meeting<00:05:03.080> the<00:05:03.200> root<00:05:03.680> crown<00:05:03.979> right<00:05:04.250> at<00:05:04.400> the<00:05:04.460> base

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:04.610 
meeting the root crown right at the base

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:06.760 
meeting the root crown right at the base
there<00:05:04.940> so<00:05:05.690> we<00:05:05.810> don't<00:05:05.900> have<00:05:06.080> that<00:05:06.140> mulch<00:05:06.530> up

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:06.770 
there so we don't have that mulch up

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:11.560 
there so we don't have that mulch up
next<00:05:07.130> to<00:05:07.250> it<00:05:09.160> so<00:05:10.160> mulch<00:05:10.430> on<00:05:10.669> the<00:05:10.970> soil<00:05:11.120> can<00:05:11.390> also

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:11.570 
next to it so mulch on the soil can also

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:14.290 
next to it so mulch on the soil can also
help<00:05:11.900> help<00:05:12.470> lessen<00:05:13.010> the<00:05:13.280> impact<00:05:13.400> of<00:05:13.970> rain<00:05:14.270> or

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:14.300 
help help lessen the impact of rain or

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:15.940 
help help lessen the impact of rain or
sprinkler<00:05:14.960> any<00:05:15.080> kind<00:05:15.229> of<00:05:15.290> water<00:05:15.470> droplets

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:15.950 
sprinkler any kind of water droplets

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:18.219 
sprinkler any kind of water droplets
hitting<00:05:16.220> the<00:05:16.310> soil<00:05:16.610> and<00:05:16.790> spread<00:05:17.750> that<00:05:17.930> water

00:05:18.219 --> 00:05:18.229 
hitting the soil and spread that water

00:05:18.229 --> 00:05:21.490 
hitting the soil and spread that water
out<00:05:18.350> and<00:05:18.770> hold<00:05:19.040> on<00:05:19.220> to<00:05:19.460> it<00:05:19.610> and<00:05:20.470> let<00:05:21.470> it

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:21.500 
out and hold on to it and let it

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:23.500 
out and hold on to it and let it
infiltrate<00:05:22.190> down<00:05:22.430> before<00:05:22.970> running<00:05:23.270> off

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:23.510 
infiltrate down before running off

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:27.190 
infiltrate down before running off
anytime<00:05:24.440> water<00:05:25.419> hits<00:05:26.419> the<00:05:26.600> ground<00:05:26.810> and

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:27.200 
anytime water hits the ground and

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:29.440 
anytime water hits the ground and
there's<00:05:27.830> a<00:05:27.890> slope<00:05:28.310> it'll<00:05:28.790> gain<00:05:29.000> speed<00:05:29.419> and

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:29.450 
there's a slope it'll gain speed and

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:31.420 
there's a slope it'll gain speed and
when<00:05:29.720> it<00:05:29.810> gains<00:05:29.990> speed<00:05:30.169> it<00:05:30.500> gains<00:05:30.919> erosive

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:31.430 
when it gains speed it gains erosive

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:34.480 
when it gains speed it gains erosive
force<00:05:32.030> it'll<00:05:32.390> start<00:05:32.630> roading<00:05:33.229> things<00:05:33.590> so<00:05:34.280> if

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:34.490 
force it'll start roading things so if

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:36.640 
force it'll start roading things so if
we<00:05:34.610> slow<00:05:34.910> it<00:05:34.940> down<00:05:35.090> by<00:05:35.750> mulch<00:05:36.080> you<00:05:36.289> can<00:05:36.410> imagine

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:36.650 
we slow it down by mulch you can imagine

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:39.490 
we slow it down by mulch you can imagine
a<00:05:37.039> water<00:05:37.580> droplet<00:05:37.880> hitting<00:05:38.479> a<00:05:38.630> sponge<00:05:39.140> it

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:39.500 
a water droplet hitting a sponge it

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:41.380 
a water droplet hitting a sponge it
would<00:05:39.620> kind<00:05:39.830> of<00:05:39.860> just<00:05:39.919> go<00:05:40.520> in<00:05:40.669> and<00:05:40.789> soak<00:05:41.150> out

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:41.390 
would kind of just go in and soak out

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:44.170 
would kind of just go in and soak out
soak<00:05:41.990> in<00:05:42.200> slowly<00:05:42.680> and<00:05:42.950> spread<00:05:43.250> out<00:05:43.430> as<00:05:43.669> opposed

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:44.180 
soak in slowly and spread out as opposed

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:46.390 
soak in slowly and spread out as opposed
to<00:05:44.270> hitting<00:05:44.479> a<00:05:44.570> pane<00:05:44.780> of<00:05:44.810> glass<00:05:44.960> just<00:05:45.620> ding<00:05:46.010> and

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:46.400 
to hitting a pane of glass just ding and

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:49.060 
to hitting a pane of glass just ding and
rolling<00:05:46.940> right<00:05:47.120> off<00:05:47.270> really<00:05:47.450> fast<00:05:47.740> so<00:05:48.740> this<00:05:48.919> is

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:49.070 
rolling right off really fast so this is

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:50.710 
rolling right off really fast so this is
like<00:05:49.160> a<00:05:49.220> sponge<00:05:49.520> it's<00:05:49.880> an<00:05:50.000> organic<00:05:50.180> matter

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:50.720 
like a sponge it's an organic matter

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:51.790 
like a sponge it's an organic matter

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:54.330 
sponge
and<00:05:51.919> it<00:05:52.009> will<00:05:52.099> hold<00:05:52.340> a<00:05:52.520> lot<00:05:52.669> of<00:05:52.819> moisture<00:05:52.970> and

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:54.340 
and it will hold a lot of moisture and

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:57.100 
and it will hold a lot of moisture and
make<00:05:55.340> it<00:05:55.460> available<00:05:55.639> longer<00:05:56.419> to<00:05:56.599> the<00:05:56.690> plants

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:57.110 
make it available longer to the plants

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:59.200 
make it available longer to the plants
too<00:05:57.319> so<00:05:57.770> you're<00:05:58.069> going<00:05:58.190> to<00:05:58.250> have<00:05:58.310> a<00:05:58.669> lot<00:05:58.970> less

00:05:59.200 --> 00:05:59.210 
too so you're going to have a lot less

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:10.110 
too so you're going to have a lot less
drought<00:06:00.199> problems<00:06:00.470> with<00:06:01.099> mulch

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:10.120
