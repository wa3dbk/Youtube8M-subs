00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:56.780 
and they executed so it's not like a

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:58.600 
and they executed so it's not like a
button<00:00:57.020> pressing<00:00:57.380> type<00:00:57.560> thing<00:00:57.800> but<00:00:57.950> it's<00:00:58.280> very

00:00:58.600 --> 00:00:58.610 
button pressing type thing but it's very

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:59.889 
button pressing type thing but it's very
very<00:00:58.790> action-oriented<00:00:59.329> because<00:00:59.660> there's<00:00:59.840> a

00:00:59.889 --> 00:00:59.899 
very action-oriented because there's a

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:01.420 
very action-oriented because there's a
lot<00:00:59.960> of<00:01:00.050> things<00:01:00.260> going<00:01:00.410> on<00:01:00.710> if<00:01:00.860> you<00:01:00.950> feel<00:01:01.190> a

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:01.430 
lot of things going on if you feel a

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:03.010 
lot of things going on if you feel a
good<00:01:01.670> sense<00:01:01.880> of<00:01:02.030> urgency<00:01:02.180> you<00:01:02.600> can<00:01:02.840> jump

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:03.020 
good sense of urgency you can jump

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:04.179 
good sense of urgency you can jump
around<00:01:03.140> between<00:01:03.440> the<00:01:03.590> characters<00:01:03.710> see<00:01:04.070> how

00:01:04.179 --> 00:01:04.189 
around between the characters see how

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:07.090 
around between the characters see how
they're<00:01:04.339> doing<00:01:05.680> I'm<00:01:06.680> not<00:01:06.799> going<00:01:06.920> to<00:01:07.009> really

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:07.100 
they're doing I'm not going to really

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.410 
they're doing I'm not going to really
talk<00:01:07.280> about<00:01:07.340> enemy<00:01:07.820> scaling<00:01:08.210> at<00:01:08.299> this

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:08.420 
talk about enemy scaling at this

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:09.910 
talk about enemy scaling at this
standpoint<00:01:08.750> but<00:01:09.020> I<00:01:09.079> can<00:01:09.259> see<00:01:09.439> when<00:01:09.590> we<00:01:09.680> develop

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:09.920 
standpoint but I can see when we develop

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.249 
standpoint but I can see when we develop
the<00:01:10.430> universe<00:01:10.850> the<00:01:11.149> Dragon<00:01:11.479> Age<00:01:11.600> universe<00:01:12.020> and

the areas that we were using in dragon
age<00:01:15.170> origins<00:01:15.409> we<00:01:16.310> chose<00:01:17.180> those<00:01:17.510> areas<00:01:18.080> to

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:18.260 
age origins we chose those areas to

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.440 
age origins we chose those areas to
support<00:01:18.710> the<00:01:18.830> story<00:01:19.159> and<00:01:19.460> those<00:01:19.880> areas<00:01:20.270> have

support the story and those areas have

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:23.010 
support the story and those areas have
very<00:01:20.690> specific<00:01:20.960> creatures<00:01:21.620> very<00:01:21.950> specific
