00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
that was a little different because your

00:01:58.259 --> 00:01:59.660 
that was a little different because your

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.679 
you're not thinking up to someone's
mouth<00:02:01.950> because<00:02:02.729> their<00:02:03.210> mouths<00:02:03.420> move

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
per se I mean it is animated but the

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.640 
per se I mean it is animated but the
characters<00:02:24.030> don't<00:02:24.599> have<00:02:24.840> an<00:02:24.930> automated<00:02:25.410> type

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650
