American Craftsman workshop now I think

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.179 
American Craftsman workshop now I think
it's<00:01:04.049> important<00:01:04.409> to<00:01:04.470> talk<00:01:04.559> about<00:01:04.619> how<00:01:04.979> I<00:01:05.010> use

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
it's important to talk about how I use

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.670 
it's important to talk about how I use
the<00:01:05.309> card<00:01:05.489> scraper<00:01:05.869> because<00:01:06.869> this<00:01:07.350> is<00:01:07.500> going

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
the card scraper because this is going

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.679 
the card scraper because this is going
to<00:01:07.770> put<00:01:07.920> my<00:01:08.040> sharpening<00:01:08.549> method<00:01:08.700> into<00:01:09.060> context

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
to put my sharpening method into context

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.109 
to put my sharpening method into context
the<00:01:09.869> card<00:01:10.560> scraper<00:01:11.040> is<00:01:11.310> part<00:01:11.700> of<00:01:11.790> an<00:01:11.880> overall

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
the card scraper is part of an overall

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.179 
the card scraper is part of an overall
workflow<00:01:12.540> that<00:01:13.229> may<00:01:13.470> start<00:01:13.740> with<00:01:13.830> the<00:01:13.950> drum

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
workflow that may start with the drum

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.920 
workflow that may start with the drum
sander<00:01:14.670> which<00:01:15.090> leaves<00:01:15.360> tracked<00:01:15.659> lines

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
sander which leaves tracked lines

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.350 
sander which leaves tracked lines
because<00:01:16.439> it<00:01:16.590> doesn't<00:01:16.860> oscillate<00:01:17.000> the<00:01:18.000> card

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
because it doesn't oscillate the card

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.390 
because it doesn't oscillate the card
scraper<00:01:18.780> will<00:01:19.080> quickly<00:01:19.560> remove<00:01:19.979> this<00:01:20.159> track

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
scraper will quickly remove this track

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.760 
scraper will quickly remove this track
lines<00:01:20.700> then<00:01:21.210> I<00:01:21.240> always<00:01:21.600> follow<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:22.500> card

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770

here's how I sharpen my card scraper

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.370 
here's how I sharpen my card scraper
using<00:01:47.399> just<00:01:47.579> a<00:01:47.729> file<00:01:48.000> I<00:01:48.299> leave<00:01:48.869> the<00:01:48.960> mill<00:01:49.140> file

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
using just a file I leave the mill file

using just a file I leave the mill file
chucked<00:01:49.829> up<00:01:49.979> in<00:01:50.159> my<00:01:50.310> vise<00:01:50.759> on<00:01:51.000> the<00:01:51.090> bench<00:01:51.299> and<00:01:51.630> I

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
chucked up in my vise on the bench and I

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.499 
chucked up in my vise on the bench and I
simply<00:01:52.829> hold<00:01:53.040> it<00:01:53.130> at<00:01:53.220> a<00:01:53.250> 90<00:01:53.520> I<00:01:53.820> don't<00:01:54.090> use<00:01:54.240> jigs

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
simply hold it at a 90 I don't use jigs

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.899 
simply hold it at a 90 I don't use jigs
or<00:01:54.659> anything<00:01:54.869> I<00:01:55.259> simply<00:01:56.070> hold<00:01:56.219> this<00:01:56.340> at<00:01:56.520> a<00:01:56.549> 90

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
or anything I simply hold this at a 90

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.940 
or anything I simply hold this at a 90
to<00:01:57.149> the<00:01:57.180> file<00:01:57.659> and<00:01:57.960> I<00:01:58.259> stroke<00:01:58.530> it<00:01:58.649> three<00:01:58.829> or

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
to the file and I stroke it three or

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.120 
to the file and I stroke it three or
four<00:01:59.100> times<00:01:59.310> then<00:02:00.060> I<00:02:00.180> flip<00:02:00.479> it<00:02:00.509> and<00:02:01.079> Stroke<00:02:02.009> it

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
four times then I flip it and Stroke it

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.830 
four times then I flip it and Stroke it
three<00:02:02.280> to<00:02:02.369> four<00:02:02.549> times<00:02:02.670> more<00:02:03.030> this<00:02:03.450> simply

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
three to four times more this simply

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.450 
three to four times more this simply
creates<00:02:04.140> even<00:02:04.409> wear<00:02:04.619> so<00:02:04.890> I<00:02:04.920> don't<00:02:05.189> end<00:02:05.340> up<00:02:05.430> with

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
creates even wear so I don't end up with

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:11.540 
creates even wear so I don't end up with
a<00:02:05.610> tapered<00:02:05.880> card

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:20.059 

now<00:02:12.550> I<00:02:12.580> flip<00:02:12.880> it<00:02:12.910> over<00:02:13.150> and<00:02:13.270> do<00:02:13.480> the<00:02:13.510> other<00:02:13.630> side

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:20.069 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:28.140 

now<00:02:21.069> watch<00:02:21.310> this<00:02:25.110> and<00:02:26.130> I<00:02:27.130> can<00:02:27.340> push<00:02:27.760> the<00:02:27.910> card

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
now watch this and I can push the card

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.150 
now watch this and I can push the card
or<00:02:28.360> I<00:02:28.390> can<00:02:28.600> pull<00:02:28.780> it<00:02:28.810> and<00:02:29.160> produce

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
or I can pull it and produce

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:44.160 
or I can pull it and produce
feather-like<00:02:30.610> shavings<00:02:32.700> there<00:02:33.700> we<00:02:33.820> go<00:02:43.170> okay

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
feather-like shavings there we go okay

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:45.780 
feather-like shavings there we go okay
now<00:02:44.200> here's<00:02:44.530> the<00:02:44.590> method<00:02:44.980> and<00:02:45.100> close-up<00:02:45.489> again

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
now here's the method and close-up again

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:48.690 
now here's the method and close-up again
I<00:02:45.970> simply<00:02:46.450> hold<00:02:47.080> the<00:02:47.200> card<00:02:47.500> at<00:02:47.680> a<00:02:47.739> ninety<00:02:48.550> to

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
I simply hold the card at a ninety to

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.060 
I simply hold the card at a ninety to
the<00:02:48.820> file<00:02:49.060> and<00:02:49.330> I<00:02:50.110> stroke<00:02:50.410> at<00:02:50.590> three<00:02:50.800> to<00:02:50.890> four

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:51.070 
the file and I stroke at three to four

00:02:51.070 --> 00:03:00.810 
the file and I stroke at three to four
times<00:02:53.940> turn<00:02:54.940> it<00:02:55.090> around<00:02:58.560> and<00:02:59.560> Stroke<00:03:00.489> it<00:03:00.640> three

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:00.820 
times turn it around and Stroke it three

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:03.060 
times turn it around and Stroke it three
to<00:03:00.910> four<00:03:01.090> times<00:03:01.239> again<00:03:01.630> just<00:03:02.500> just<00:03:02.709> helps

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:03.070 
to four times again just just helps

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:05.190 
to four times again just just helps
create<00:03:03.370> even<00:03:03.760> where<00:03:03.970> now<00:03:04.840> I'm<00:03:04.930> going<00:03:05.050> to<00:03:05.110> do

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
create even where now I'm going to do

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:21.330 
create even where now I'm going to do
the<00:03:05.320> other<00:03:05.410> side<00:03:05.709> now<00:03:11.310> watch<00:03:12.310> this<00:03:12.640> I<00:03:20.340> think

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 
the other side now watch this I think

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:24.560 
the other side now watch this I think
right<00:03:21.549> there<00:03:21.579> the<00:03:22.180> proof<00:03:22.450> is<00:03:22.630> in<00:03:22.660> the<00:03:22.810> pudding

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:24.570 
right there the proof is in the pudding

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:27.900 
right there the proof is in the pudding
