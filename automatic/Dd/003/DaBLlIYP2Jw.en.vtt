00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:20.920 
that's about it so first off I really

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.589 
that's about it so first off I really
like<00:01:21.099> him<00:01:21.340> I<00:01:21.459> think<00:01:21.520> he's<00:01:21.729> a<00:01:21.759> cool<00:01:21.880> looking

00:01:22.589 --> 00:01:22.599 
like him I think he's a cool looking

like him I think he's a cool looking
figure<00:01:23.020> his<00:01:23.709> mace<00:01:24.599> does<00:01:25.599> tab<00:01:26.170> into<00:01:26.739> the<00:01:26.830> tail

00:01:27.059 --> 00:01:27.069 
figure his mace does tab into the tail

00:01:27.069 --> 00:01:28.910 
figure his mace does tab into the tail
here<00:01:27.399> it<00:01:27.520> actually<00:01:27.849> fits<00:01:28.119> in<00:01:28.270> these<00:01:28.390> little

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
here it actually fits in these little

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.180 
here it actually fits in these little
slots<00:01:29.920> it<00:01:30.670> I<00:01:31.420> don't<00:01:32.349> really<00:01:32.410> like<00:01:32.679> to<00:01:32.860> do<00:01:33.009> it

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:33.190 
slots it I don't really like to do it

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:36.449 
slots it I don't really like to do it
because<00:01:33.399> if<00:01:34.119> you'll<00:01:34.360> see<00:01:35.069> there's<00:01:36.069> a<00:01:36.190> peg

00:01:36.449 --> 00:01:36.459 
because if you'll see there's a peg

00:01:36.459 --> 00:01:39.960 
because if you'll see there's a peg
right<00:01:36.729> there<00:01:38.190> it<00:01:39.190> already<00:01:39.489> is<00:01:39.640> getting

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:39.970 
right there it already is getting

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:41.729 
right there it already is getting
stretch<00:01:40.300> marks<00:01:40.630> in<00:01:40.780> the<00:01:40.869> hole<00:01:41.080> and<00:01:41.380> when<00:01:41.590> you

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:41.739 
stretch marks in the hole and when you

00:01:41.739 --> 00:01:45.300 
stretch marks in the hole and when you
put<00:01:42.009> this<00:01:42.220> on<00:01:42.459> it<00:01:42.970> like<00:01:43.709> pinches<00:01:44.709> it's<00:01:44.890> so

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:45.310 
put this on it like pinches it's so

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.809 
put this on it like pinches it's so
tight<00:01:45.759> that<00:01:46.090> it<00:01:47.020> is<00:01:47.380> gonna<00:01:48.190> mess<00:01:48.369> it<00:01:48.520> up<00:01:48.580> and<00:01:48.729> I

00:01:48.809 --> 00:01:48.819 
tight that it is gonna mess it up and I

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:51.589 
tight that it is gonna mess it up and I
think<00:01:49.060> it's<00:01:49.179> the<00:01:49.330> dumbest<00:01:49.959> thing<00:01:50.050> to<00:01:50.800> have

00:01:51.589 --> 00:01:51.599 
think it's the dumbest thing to have

00:01:51.599 --> 00:01:54.719 
think it's the dumbest thing to have
that<00:01:52.599> it<00:01:53.229> just<00:01:53.410> looks<00:01:53.560> awful<00:01:54.039> so<00:01:54.069> just<00:01:54.610> leave

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:54.729 
that it just looks awful so just leave

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:58.229 
that it just looks awful so just leave
it<00:01:54.819> off<00:01:54.970> to<00:01:55.119> the<00:01:55.209> side<00:01:56.160> but<00:01:57.160> as<00:01:57.369> far<00:01:57.580> as<00:01:57.610> him<00:01:58.030> his

00:01:58.229 --> 00:01:58.239 
it off to the side but as far as him his

00:01:58.239 --> 00:02:01.650 
it off to the side but as far as him his
gimmick<00:01:58.840> or<00:01:59.050> feature<00:02:00.270> you<00:02:01.270> push<00:02:01.479> this<00:02:01.599> button

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:01.660 
gimmick or feature you push this button

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:10.260 
gimmick or feature you push this button
here<00:02:03.119> and<00:02:05.550> his<00:02:06.550> mouth<00:02:06.910> open<00:02:07.629> and<00:02:07.780> closes<00:02:09.270> he's

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:12.540 
here and his mouth open and closes he's
very<00:02:10.929> cool<00:02:11.200> it<00:02:11.530> means<00:02:11.770> a<00:02:11.890> cool<00:02:12.069> looking<00:02:12.370> figure

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
very cool it means a cool looking figure

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:17.070 
very cool it means a cool looking figure
he<00:02:13.920> transforms<00:02:14.920> very<00:02:15.220> easily<00:02:15.760> he's<00:02:16.330> nice<00:02:16.629> I

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
he transforms very easily he's nice I

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.259 
he transforms very easily he's nice I
probably<00:02:17.980> will<00:02:18.190> fumble<00:02:18.430> now<00:02:18.760> that<00:02:18.910> I<00:02:18.940> said<00:02:19.060> it

00:02:19.259 --> 00:02:19.269

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
well he's cool so let's get to transform

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
well he's cool so let's get to transform
and<00:02:28.290> I'm<00:02:28.350> I<00:02:28.410> don't<00:02:28.470> want<00:02:28.650> to<00:02:28.710> drag<00:02:28.860> this<00:02:29.010> out

because<00:05:35.030> whenever<00:05:35.390> I<00:05:35.540> say<00:05:35.840> oh<00:05:36.110> he<00:05:36.380> can

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:36.560 
because whenever I say oh he can

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:38.770 
because whenever I say oh he can
obviously<00:05:37.160> hold<00:05:37.520> that<00:05:37.640> his<00:05:37.790> hand<00:05:38.060> it<00:05:38.570> doesn't

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:38.780 
obviously hold that his hand it doesn't

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:40.960 
obviously hold that his hand it doesn't
want<00:05:38.960> to<00:05:39.080> go<00:05:39.170> in<00:05:39.350> whatever<00:05:40.160> figure<00:05:40.520> it<00:05:40.640> is<00:05:40.790> it's

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:40.970 
want to go in whatever figure it is it's

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:46.240 
want to go in whatever figure it is it's
amazing<00:05:42.250> hold<00:05:43.250> up<00:05:44.620> this<00:05:45.620> is<00:05:45.830> supposed<00:05:46.040> to<00:05:46.100> go

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:46.250 
amazing hold up this is supposed to go

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:48.730 
amazing hold up this is supposed to go
in<00:05:46.280> here<00:05:46.490> so<00:05:46.940> there<00:05:47.480> we<00:05:47.570> go<00:05:47.600> they<00:05:48.500> probably

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:48.740 
in here so there we go they probably

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:50.200 
in here so there we go they probably
would<00:05:48.980> go<00:05:49.130> into<00:05:49.310> that<00:05:49.400> one<00:05:49.640> it's<00:05:49.820> just<00:05:49.970> it's<00:05:50.120> a

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:50.210 
would go into that one it's just it's a

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:53.860 
would go into that one it's just it's a
little<00:05:50.420> bit<00:05:50.540> tighter<00:05:50.780> so<00:05:51.610> anyways<00:05:52.610> so<00:05:53.600> here's

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:53.870 
little bit tighter so anyways so here's

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:55.500 
little bit tighter so anyways so here's
his<00:05:54.080> mace

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:55.510 
his mace

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:58.480 
his mace
there's<00:05:56.510> the<00:05:57.020> Grimlock<00:05:57.530> and<00:05:58.070> he<00:05:58.280> looked

00:05:58.480 --> 00:05:58.490

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:02.410 
there's the Grimlock and he looked
pretty<00:05:58.730> cool<00:05:58.940> so<00:05:59.560> he<00:06:00.880> definitely<00:06:01.880> a<00:06:02.180> nice

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:05.420 
looking figure he it's a tough call I

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:07.420 
looking figure he it's a tough call I

don't know if I like him this one the

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:11.350 
don't know if I like him this one the
Voyager<00:06:07.820> more<00:06:08.060> than<00:06:08.210> I<00:06:08.300> like<00:06:08.540> the<00:06:10.330> yeah<00:06:11.330> I

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:11.360 
Voyager more than I like the yeah I

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:12.430 
Voyager more than I like the yeah I
don't<00:06:11.450> know<00:06:11.570> if<00:06:11.660> I<00:06:11.720> like<00:06:11.870> the<00:06:11.960> Voyager<00:06:12.290> more

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:12.440 
don't know if I like the Voyager more

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:17.410 
don't know if I like the Voyager more
than<00:06:12.560> I<00:06:12.620> like<00:06:12.770> the<00:06:12.890> leader<00:06:13.100> it's<00:06:14.200> 50/50<00:06:16.270> but<00:06:17.270> no

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:17.420 
than I like the leader it's 50/50 but no

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:19.840 
than I like the leader it's 50/50 but no
it's<00:06:18.350> kind<00:06:18.560> of<00:06:18.590> hard<00:06:18.770> to<00:06:18.830> say<00:06:19.100> I<00:06:19.130> think<00:06:19.460> that

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:19.850 
it's kind of hard to say I think that

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:21.250 
it's kind of hard to say I think that
they're<00:06:20.390> both<00:06:20.510> great

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:21.260 
they're both great

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:26.050 
they're both great
it's<00:06:21.410> just<00:06:22.150> preference<00:06:24.760> you<00:06:25.760> know<00:06:25.790> this

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:26.060 
it's just preference you know this

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:29.350 
it's just preference you know this
himself<00:06:26.750> I<00:06:27.260> mean<00:06:27.410> he<00:06:27.680> he<00:06:27.980> does<00:06:28.190> look<00:06:28.520> make<00:06:29.330> sure

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:29.360 
himself I mean he he does look make sure

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:37.320 
himself I mean he he does look make sure
I<00:06:29.480> have<00:06:29.570> this<00:06:29.690> done<00:06:29.930> right<00:06:30.170> I<00:06:31.480> guess<00:06:32.480> so<00:06:35.410> yep<00:06:36.410> I

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:37.330 
I have this done right I guess so yep I

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:39.540 
I have this done right I guess so yep I
think<00:06:38.330> that's<00:06:38.690> right

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:39.550 
think that's right

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:43.420 
think that's right
so<00:06:40.960> yeah<00:06:41.960> it's<00:06:42.140> 50/50<00:06:42.740> whatever<00:06:43.010> you<00:06:43.130> think<00:06:43.340> is

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:43.430 
so yeah it's 50/50 whatever you think is

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:44.680 
so yeah it's 50/50 whatever you think is
better<00:06:43.580> I<00:06:43.730> actually<00:06:43.940> like<00:06:44.270> the<00:06:44.390> leader<00:06:44.600> a

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:44.690 
better I actually like the leader a

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:47.560 
better I actually like the leader a
little<00:06:44.960> bit<00:06:45.110> better<00:06:45.260> in<00:06:45.500> robot<00:06:45.890> mode<00:06:46.570> dinosaur

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:49.880 
mode on both is kind of weak but it's

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:52.120
