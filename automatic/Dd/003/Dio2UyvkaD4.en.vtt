00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.930
 the other capitals come naturally 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.910
 also still on it 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.489
 when this happens and what is going on there 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.530
 expected you read the best times on the 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.020

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.300
 letter through the get agile into 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.969
 play a box and yes I am 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.100
 now here in lionstone there is 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.720
 that's a lot to discover though 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.030
 ticks is not there yet 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.159
 first of all, of course, here is like 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.290
 stone has been decorated one has now 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.250
 this wintery Christmas 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.590
 ambiance 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.000
 very much effort was remembered 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.350
 him like me 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.920
 and of course there are three new ones 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:27.720
 mini-games extra for this big event 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:30.780
 the mini games themselves can be found here 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.909
 near the mystical forge the 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.710
 now has a huge snow globe 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.840
 get donated as much as quantity 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.090
 looks and in this snail itself 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.710
 then find the mini mirror instead 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.689
 you do not need the mystic 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:46.320
 hour to the mini games to 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:48.299
 but the npcs and those can be located 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.770
 here around the mystical games around 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:52.530
 For example, we have the bells 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.130
 maestro offers the chimes 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.770
 on 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.719
 Here we have a festive 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.829
 young people he offers a new one 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.540
 staff 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:02.850
 and finally there is the 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:06.159
 gardisten offers festive offers 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.960
 a new pvp mini game for you 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:12.099
 and I would say a look 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:13.209
 the chimes I play now and on 

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:14.830
 At the beginning there is a small one 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:17.160
 instructions what you actually do 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:19.930
 in order to make it short you have to 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:22.480
 single pieces of music from guild wars 2 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:24.790
 after playing for it just chatting 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:28.000
 this snowman and then says to 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:30.160
 which pitch you actually play 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.160
 So would like my sound one 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:35.010
 play medium or low tone and 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:38.170
 if you have decided for it 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:40.030
 If you end up hurrying on this model what 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:42.129
 you see it in the middle and had to 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:44.410
 In addition to sharing a particular piece of music 

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:46.319
 replay and have these pieces of music 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:48.489
 also different difficulties 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:50.110
 and I am here now too 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:52.000
 just arrange on this 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:54.519
 I can already say that I am 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.200
 really bad in this mini play this 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:57.879
 I think there is hardly anybody like that 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.799
 quickly lost the mini-game like 

00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:01.299
 I'm actually the trick 

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:02.859
 Just you have to paint so fast 

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:05.680
 as you press the farther you go 

00:03:02.859 --> 00:03:07.000
 are and the colors you can see below 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.530
 at 1 to 9 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.170
 vice because here too on this model 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:12.280
 and even the sounds distributed at even 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.290
 again the colors so actually 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:16.060
 you know quite well but he do 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:17.829
 the colors come out the more harm 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:20.620
 cause them if they are with you 

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:22.720
 arrive and yes I have that totally 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:23.590
 somehow sweaty and now have too 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.930
 lost again 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:27.459
 This is definitely not my girl's game 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:29.230
 and that's why I would say 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:31.690
 to throw a look into the now 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:34.150
 picture here you have right now 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:36.489
 again before a small overflight 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:39.160
 you can fit into jumping yourself and come 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:42.220
 to know where to go and then 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:44.859
 You end up here in this waiting room because 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:47.500
 the jumping kassel is limited in time 

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:49.060
 and if you can not do that like two 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:51.430
 to come new then you have only with the 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:55.180
 Waiting room and have to wait until the bar 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:57.639
 is full on the top right and I am 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:59.290
 me here in jumping kassel myself 

00:03:57.639 --> 00:04:00.700
 the jumping kassel has a few 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:02.349
 special features to look out for 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:04.090
 but I will not do that now 

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:06.430
 I will also go jumping 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:09.069
 Do not solve a person if you want to know 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:11.769
 you want to pay attention or just 

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:14.190
 Participants also solved the doping problem 

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:16.560
 You go to the best times 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:18.690
 dusel the dÃ¼ssel has everything 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:22.260
 important recorded and also has that 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:23.520
 jumping base solved and I would say 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:26.700
 we'll throw one more now 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:29.580
 Final view of the pvp mini 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:32.580
 That is also in this play 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:36.540
 winter tone held and the task is 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:39.000
 actually relatively easy you have to 

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:40.830
 present in the middle of the pvp 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.950
 battlefield is in its own 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:44.430
 bring base and score points in the tariff 

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:46.320
 can 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:47.820
 but you do not do this with your own 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:50.160
 class you just picked 

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:52.140
 but just shares with one 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.820
 Premade class you can 

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:54.930
 for this a total of three classes 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:57.330
 decide 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:58.950
 I once took the of supported 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:01.500
 the supporters actually did exactly 

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:04.440
 what the name already suggests 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:07.200
 he supports his members in the 

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:09.390
 he drops or turns off his opponents 

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:11.550
 slip or just divide one 

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:13.200
 ice wall poses and the allies heals 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:15.480
 So that's all 

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:17.670
 needs support and here we have 

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:20.600
 now this carrier has the must 

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:22.350
 now just run back to the starting point 

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:24.330
 and the opponent must of course 

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:27.000
 prevented killing and even that 

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:29.820
 to take gift and into its base too 

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:33.270
 like me , but surely bring him and 

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:36.510
 defends so he has no problems 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:39.990
 in the base to the nuclear is usually 

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:41.700
 because my constant back and forth and if 

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:44.040
 to hand over gifts in the basis 

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:46.770
 you get points by killing them 

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:50.310
 Players also get points and who 

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:52.860
 500 points as the first one 

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:55.230
 has won this round 

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:57.960
 but there is also a pvp where this is 

00:05:55.230 --> 00:06:00.570
 mini game is not pvp points 

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:04.320
 Unfortunately, that's all I have to do 

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:06.330
 say of minigames one until now 

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:09.360
 I was able to play this here 

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:11.190
 Most fun and I can do it 

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:12.870
 also only recommend 

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:16.080
 and yes that was the same again 

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:17.160
 Survey for the winter day 2012 I hope 

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:19.500
 She liked the i hope 

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:22.080
 I enjoyed it and I wish it 

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:23.880
 Definitely beautiful christmas and 

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:26.900
 See you next time 

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:26.900
 then again bite
