00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.940
 Hi there, this is the fourth video of 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:08.760
 performance pc series 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:11.040
 This is our power unit for powerful 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:15.089
 computer need a powerful power supply a 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:16.880
 put and 1 kilowatt from the company 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.570
 thermaltake called thermaltake 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:21.570
 tr2 rx 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.699
 1000 watts is a bronze block series 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.519
 Power professional gamers can 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:29.400
 put and gold and even a new dress 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.890
 a series but we have enough of it all 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.350
 choose the power supply as well as set 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.170
 memory is not enough but a lot will just 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:40.649
 overpayment of money must be taken with a margin 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:43.500
 about 50 watts count it just 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:46.410
 the video card consumes about 400 500 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.989
 watts of energy is the newest on the site 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.210
 manufacturer can find out the processor 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:54.180
 about 100 watts the rest is already 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:58.469
 Winchester cooler only turns out 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:01.829
 that 500 + 100 plus 100 equals 700 margin 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:04.320
 it's about 750 but everyone has their own stock 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:07.409
 power and later I will tell why 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.540
 need such a power supply itself black 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:15.200
 matt with all possible cables 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:15.200
 Standard and from 24 x house to unpack 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:22.500
 inside we have this instruction 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:26.920
 This apparently warranty card 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:31.329
 Immediately remove the left side of us 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:33.820
 there is a power cord in 

00:01:31.329 --> 00:01:38.200
 such a black thermal bag 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:40.890
 Velcro take we are all 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.890
 cables 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:46.960
 so the power supply itself is black matte 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:48.569
 standard from and the fan is mounted on 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.520
 140 millimeters 

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:53.590
 1800 rpm most 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:56.189
 males as I have already shown comes off 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:59.319
 and excess can be removed in a handbag 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:03.659
 embedded cables installed major 

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:08.970
 this is powering the motherboard 24 ping and 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:11.680
 processor power 8 pints and 2 x 4 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:14.290
 cable length is great for 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:16.630
 placing the power supply from the bottom to the word i 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:18.340
 I am looking for ordered a pair of wires extension for 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:24.340
 small modding they look 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:24.850
 something like this they will be all black 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.560
 colors 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:30.400
 Well, let's see how they will look at 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:33.130
 our body as for the text about 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:37.359
 widows that we had a set of 6 pin 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:43.569
 write 3 8 pins too 3 8 pins on 

00:02:37.359 --> 00:02:48.400
 processor 1 15-pin us from 8 pieces 4 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:50.829
 pin for processor 1 and 2 incomprehensible 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:54.190
 I have connectors that have not long ago 

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:58.239
 this is 4 pin for the flop 1 and 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:03:00.700
 4 pin 18 and incomprehensible pieces there 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:04.000
 the end unfortunately that's all 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:06.880
