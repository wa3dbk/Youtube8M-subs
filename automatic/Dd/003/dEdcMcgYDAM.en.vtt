amen when my mind is jacked in and I'm
walking<00:00:43.350> around<00:00:44.270> experiencing<00:00:45.530> 1937<00:00:46.530> on<00:00:46.770> the

body stays here and kind of holds the
consciousness<00:00:49.890> of<00:00:50.039> the<00:00:50.160> program<00:00:50.579> link<00:00:50.820> unit

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
consciousness of the program link unit

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.869 
consciousness of the program link unit
they<00:00:51.750> thought<00:00:52.140> they<00:00:52.559> could<00:00:52.770> maintain<00:00:52.980> control

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
they thought they could maintain control

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.540 
they thought they could maintain control
you<00:00:54.809> can't<00:00:55.110> just<00:00:55.379> keep<00:00:55.590> plugging<00:00:56.129> your<00:00:56.250> brain

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
you can't just keep plugging your brain

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.410 
you can't just keep plugging your brain
into<00:00:57.030> this<00:00:57.149> machine

00:00:59.410 --> 00:00:59.420 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:08.230 

but<00:00:59.690> once<00:00:59.989> they<00:01:00.289> opened<00:01:00.769> the<00:01:01.010> door

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:08.240 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:13.100 

is<00:01:09.240> this<00:01:09.510> real<00:01:10.340> the<00:01:11.340> experiment<00:01:12.180> turned<00:01:12.659> on

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
is this real the experiment turned on

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.620 
is this real the experiment turned on
them<00:01:13.409> you<00:01:13.800> think<00:01:13.979> one<00:01:14.220> of<00:01:14.250> them<00:01:14.460> units<00:01:14.909> crawled

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
them you think one of them units crawled

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.060 
them you think one of them units crawled
up<00:01:15.780> the<00:01:15.960> extension<00:01:16.260> cord<00:01:16.710> and<00:01:16.860> kill<00:01:16.979> this

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
up the extension cord and kill this

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:23.240 
up the extension cord and kill this
maker<00:01:17.750> you<00:01:21.020> saying<00:01:22.020> there's<00:01:22.500> another<00:01:22.560> world

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
maker you saying there's another world

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.940 
maker you saying there's another world
on<00:01:23.820> top<00:01:24.150> of<00:01:24.360> this<00:01:24.479> one<00:01:24.690> that's<00:01:25.290> right<00:01:25.530> we're

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
on top of this one that's right we're

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.290 
on top of this one that's right we're
nothing<00:01:26.070> but<00:01:26.310> a<00:01:26.340> simulation<00:01:26.850> on<00:01:27.060> some

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:27.300 
nothing but a simulation on some

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:34.100 
nothing but a simulation on some
computer<00:01:27.780> so<00:01:28.470> who's<00:01:28.650> in<00:01:28.920> control<00:01:32.930> you<00:01:33.930> could

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
computer so who's in control you could

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:50.719 
computer so who's in control you could
call<00:01:34.290> it<00:01:34.409> the<00:01:34.560> end<00:01:34.680> of<00:01:34.830> the<00:01:34.890> world

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.469 

the<00:01:51.030> 13th<00:01:51.630> floor<00:01:51.930> you<00:01:52.920> can't<00:01:53.250> go<00:01:53.430> there<00:01:53.820> even

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
the 13th floor you can't go there even

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:59.149 
the 13th floor you can't go there even
though<00:01:54.630> it<00:01:54.810> doesn't<00:01:55.079> exist

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.070 

hey<00:02:00.159> what'd<00:02:00.430> you<00:02:00.460> do<00:02:00.640> to<00:02:00.729> the<00:02:00.820> world<00:02:01.030> turned<00:02:01.960> it

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:02.080 
hey what'd you do to the world turned it

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.229 
hey what'd you do to the world turned it
off
