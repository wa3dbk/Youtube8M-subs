is actually white in the bok choy is
it's<00:00:40.390> yellow<00:00:41.320> right<00:00:41.860> so<00:00:42.840> look<00:00:43.840> at<00:00:43.960> the<00:00:44.079> stock

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:44.320

here this is almost the size of my thumb
but<00:00:47.890> is<00:00:48.040> the<00:00:48.190> perfect<00:00:48.820> this<00:00:49.480> is<00:00:49.540> the<00:00:49.630> perfect

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:49.960 
but is the perfect this is the perfect

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:54.030 
but is the perfect this is the perfect
one<00:00:50.350> to<00:00:50.590> to<00:00:50.860> harvest<00:00:51.190> fit<00:00:51.420> okay<00:00:52.420> so<00:00:53.110> I<00:00:53.440> guess<00:00:53.860> a

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:54.040 
one to to harvest fit okay so I guess a

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:56.520 
one to to harvest fit okay so I guess a
the<00:00:54.250> stem<00:00:55.239> or<00:00:55.510> the<00:00:55.540> stock<00:00:55.840> is<00:00:56.050> actually<00:00:56.440> the

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:56.530 
the stem or the stock is actually the

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:58.830 
the stem or the stock is actually the
best<00:00:56.710> part<00:00:56.890> to<00:00:57.130> eat<00:00:57.309> but<00:00:58.059> the<00:00:58.180> leaves<00:00:58.390> actually

00:00:58.830 --> 00:00:58.840 
best part to eat but the leaves actually

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.650 
best part to eat but the leaves actually
is<00:00:59.410> very<00:00:59.649> nutritious<00:00:59.950> as<00:01:00.250> well<00:01:00.460> you<00:01:01.329> can<00:01:01.480> also

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:01.660 
is very nutritious as well you can also

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:05.330 
is very nutritious as well you can also
eat<00:01:02.079> that<00:01:02.520> you<00:01:03.520> can<00:01:03.579> boil<00:01:03.910> them<00:01:04.149> up<00:01:04.239> steam<00:01:05.079> them
