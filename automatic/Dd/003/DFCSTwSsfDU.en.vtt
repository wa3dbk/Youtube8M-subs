bit<00:01:51.509> of<00:01:51.570> an<00:01:51.659> explanation<00:01:51.869> the<00:01:52.770> next<00:01:53.159> two<00:01:53.460> ones

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
bit of an explanation the next two ones

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.770 
bit of an explanation the next two ones
that<00:01:53.939> you<00:01:54.030> can<00:01:54.180> adjust<00:01:54.299> are<00:01:54.840> are<00:01:55.439> really<00:01:56.780> not

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
that you can adjust are are really not

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.200 
that you can adjust are are really not
so<00:01:58.110> difficult<00:01:58.439> to<00:01:58.649> get<00:01:58.829> around<00:01:59.040> and<00:01:59.700> they<00:02:00.060> are

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
so difficult to get around and they are

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.899 
so difficult to get around and they are
more<00:02:00.479> about<00:02:01.140> the<00:02:01.640> aggressiveness<00:02:02.640> of<00:02:02.700> the

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
more about the aggressiveness of the

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.399 
more about the aggressiveness of the
response<00:02:03.540> to<00:02:03.689> the<00:02:03.780> aircraft<00:02:04.079> or<00:02:04.200> something

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
response to the aircraft or something

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.980 
response to the aircraft or something
that<00:02:04.560> you<00:02:04.740> do<00:02:04.920> on<00:02:05.189> the<00:02:05.250> sticks<00:02:05.820> and<00:02:06.090> these<00:02:06.810> are

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
that you do on the sticks and these are

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:12.080 
that you do on the sticks and these are
called<00:02:07.259> attitude<00:02:07.979> and<00:02:08.539> braking<00:02:09.830> so<00:02:11.090> they're

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
called attitude and braking so they're

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.820 
called attitude and braking so they're
both<00:02:12.239> just<00:02:12.510> one<00:02:12.660> setting<00:02:13.050> a<00:02:13.140> percentage

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
both just one setting a percentage

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.760 
both just one setting a percentage
in<00:02:13.890> lohi<00:02:14.340> summer<00:02:14.700> in<00:02:14.820> them<00:02:14.940> in<00:02:15.090> the<00:02:15.210> middle<00:02:15.480> and

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:15.770 
in lohi summer in them in the middle and

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:20.000 
in lohi summer in them in the middle and
an<00:02:16.770> attitude<00:02:17.610> is<00:02:18.210> is<00:02:18.420> all<00:02:19.200> it<00:02:19.530> means<00:02:19.680> is

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
an attitude is is all it means is

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.070 
an attitude is is all it means is
basically<00:02:20.610> when<00:02:21.000> you<00:02:21.270> do<00:02:21.510> something<00:02:21.900> on<00:02:21.960> the

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
basically when you do something on the

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.930 
basically when you do something on the
sticks<00:02:22.380> how<00:02:22.590> aggressive<00:02:23.220> is<00:02:23.370> the<00:02:23.520> response

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
sticks how aggressive is the response

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:29.540 
sticks how aggressive is the response
how<00:02:24.180> crisp<00:02:24.600> and<00:02:25.400> rapid<00:02:26.400> will<00:02:27.060> the<00:02:27.180> aircraft<00:02:28.550> do

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
how crisp and rapid will the aircraft do

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:32.930 
how crisp and rapid will the aircraft do
what<00:02:29.730> it<00:02:29.820> is<00:02:29.910> you've<00:02:30.090> asked<00:02:30.330> it<00:02:30.420> to<00:02:30.510> do<00:02:30.980> so<00:02:32.010> the

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
what it is you've asked it to do so the

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.000 
what it is you've asked it to do so the
tightest<00:02:33.540> level<00:02:33.840> if<00:02:33.930> I<00:02:34.050> suddenly<00:02:34.380> heal<00:02:34.710> over

tightest level if I suddenly heal over

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:36.740 
tightest level if I suddenly heal over
one<00:02:35.190> way<00:02:35.370> off<00:02:35.910> you<00:02:36.090> know<00:02:36.180> it<00:02:36.300> should<00:02:36.480> react

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
one way off you know it should react

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.080 
one way off you know it should react
almost<00:02:37.350> instantaneously<00:02:38.100> at<00:02:38.700> the<00:02:38.790> lowest

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
level if I suddenly heal it over there

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.670 
level if I suddenly heal it over there
should<00:02:40.800> be<00:02:40.890> a<00:02:40.920> kind<00:02:41.130> of<00:02:41.250> a<00:02:41.340> lead-in<00:02:42.530> and<00:02:43.530> that's

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
should be a kind of a lead-in and that's

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:44.990 
should be a kind of a lead-in and that's
that<00:02:43.830> and<00:02:43.980> they've<00:02:44.070> done<00:02:44.220> they've<00:02:44.610> done<00:02:44.790> away

that and they've done they've done away

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.790 
that and they've done they've done away
in<00:02:45.030> the<00:02:45.180> p2<00:02:45.570> range<00:02:45.870> you<00:02:46.020> could<00:02:46.170> adjust<00:02:46.260> those

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
in the p2 range you could adjust those

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.340 
in the p2 range you could adjust those
across<00:02:47.220> a<00:02:47.520> few<00:02:48.090> of<00:02:48.180> the<00:02:48.300> parameters<00:02:48.900> what

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
across a few of the parameters what

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:50.930 
across a few of the parameters what
they've<00:02:49.500> done<00:02:49.650> now<00:02:49.830> is<00:02:49.950> just<00:02:50.100> put<00:02:50.250> one<00:02:50.580> overall

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
they've done now is just put one overall

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:52.940 
they've done now is just put one overall
setting<00:02:51.480> called<00:02:51.690> attitude<00:02:52.290> which<00:02:52.680> basically

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
setting called attitude which basically

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.230 
setting called attitude which basically
governs<00:02:53.640> how<00:02:53.850> every<00:02:54.420> stick<00:02:55.350> control<00:02:56.240> how

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:57.240 
governs how every stick control how

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:59.060 
governs how every stick control how
sharp<00:02:57.690> the<00:02:57.870> response<00:02:58.230> of<00:02:58.320> the<00:02:58.410> aircraft<00:02:58.740> is<00:02:58.860> to

00:02:59.060 --> 00:02:59.070 
sharp the response of the aircraft is to

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:01.870 
sharp the response of the aircraft is to
your<00:02:59.250> input<00:03:00.110> fairly<00:03:01.110> straightforward

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:01.880 
your input fairly straightforward

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:03.830 
your input fairly straightforward
although<00:03:02.880> it<00:03:03.000> can<00:03:03.180> make<00:03:03.360> a<00:03:03.390> bit<00:03:03.720> of<00:03:03.780> a

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
although it can make a bit of a

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.600 
although it can make a bit of a
difference<00:03:04.230> and<00:03:04.470> I<00:03:04.590> will<00:03:05.010> look<00:03:05.100> at<00:03:05.250> some<00:03:05.400> video

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
difference and I will look at some video

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:08.420 
difference and I will look at some video
showing<00:03:06.480> that<00:03:06.690> in<00:03:06.840> a<00:03:07.200> second<00:03:07.620> the<00:03:08.220> other

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
control that you can see down there is

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:15.380 
control that you can see down there is

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
scratching amongst other people but what

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:20.000 
scratching amongst other people but what
this<00:03:17.280> basically<00:03:17.880> refers<00:03:18.239> to<00:03:18.269> is<00:03:18.840> again<00:03:19.830> it's

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
this basically refers to is again it's

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:21.860 
this basically refers to is again it's
an<00:03:20.459> aggressiveness<00:03:21.269> factor<00:03:21.690> how

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
an aggressiveness factor how

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:24.620 
an aggressiveness factor how
aggressively<00:03:22.440> does<00:03:22.680> the<00:03:22.800> aircraft<00:03:23.360> come<00:03:24.360> to<00:03:24.600> a

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:39.300 
setting it's relatively aggressive it

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:41.360 
setting it's relatively aggressive it
puts<00:03:39.540> in<00:03:39.720> some<00:03:39.930> opposite<00:03:40.500> input<00:03:40.920> if<00:03:41.070> you<00:03:41.160> like

puts in some opposite input if you like

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:43.400

back and come to a stop you can soften

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:48.800 
back and come to a stop you can soften
that<00:03:47.340> up<00:03:47.400> a<00:03:47.640> little<00:03:47.790> bit<00:03:48.030> by<00:03:48.239> adjusting<00:03:48.660> this

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
that up a little bit by adjusting this

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:50.930 
that up a little bit by adjusting this
setting<00:03:49.230> so<00:03:49.260> if<00:03:49.800> you<00:03:49.980> don't<00:03:50.370> want<00:03:50.610> for

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 
setting so if you don't want for

the memory card of the camera to find

the memory card of the camera to find
that<00:04:56.590> it's<00:04:56.710> completely<00:04:57.070> corrupted<00:04:57.490> I<00:04:57.610> think

00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:57.820 
that it's completely corrupted I think

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:59.670 
that it's completely corrupted I think
the<00:04:58.030> card<00:04:58.360> has<00:04:58.600> finally<00:04:58.930> died<00:04:59.139> after<00:04:59.530> many

the card has finally died after many

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:01.270 
years first time it's happened so I was

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:04.230 
years first time it's happened so I was
bit<00:05:01.419> gutted<00:05:01.600> however<00:05:02.460> by<00:05:03.460> a<00:05:03.490> flukish

I<00:05:09.580> was<00:05:09.669> using<00:05:09.820> with<00:05:10.000> the<00:05:10.060> p3<00:05:10.419> so<00:05:10.900> I<00:05:10.930> have

00:05:11.129 --> 00:05:11.139 
I was using with the p3 so I have

braking<00:05:36.190> maneuvers<00:05:36.280> one<00:05:36.970> with<00:05:37.750> the<00:05:38.370> high

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:39.370 
braking maneuvers one with the high

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:40.860 
braking maneuvers one with the high
level<00:05:39.700> of<00:05:39.760> braking<00:05:40.240> the<00:05:40.330> other<00:05:40.450> one<00:05:40.599> with<00:05:40.750> it

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:40.870 
level of braking the other one with it

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:42.180 
level of braking the other one with it
down<00:05:41.080> to<00:05:41.289> its<00:05:41.380> minimum<00:05:41.830> and<00:05:42.070> you'll

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:42.190 
down to its minimum and you'll

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:43.740 
down to its minimum and you'll
definitely<00:05:42.940> see<00:05:43.090> the<00:05:43.210> difference<00:05:43.240> in<00:05:43.660> the

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:43.750 
definitely see the difference in the

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:54.780 
definitely see the difference in the
slop<00:05:44.099> so<00:05:45.099> we'll<00:05:45.669> have<00:05:45.729> a<00:05:45.789> look<00:05:45.910> at<00:05:46.000> those<00:05:46.090> now

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:42.850 
I think the memory card involved was

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:45.710 
I think the memory card involved was
many<00:06:43.690> many<00:06:43.990> views<00:06:44.740> long<00:06:44.980> in<00:06:45.100> the<00:06:45.160> tooth<00:06:45.340> so

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:45.720 
many many views long in the tooth so

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:47.940 
many many views long in the tooth so
we've<00:06:46.720> got<00:06:46.840> a<00:06:46.870> shiny<00:06:47.110> new<00:06:47.320> one<00:06:47.470> in<00:06:47.560> there<00:06:47.680> so<00:06:47.860> we

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:47.950 
we've got a shiny new one in there so we

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:50.040 
we've got a shiny new one in there so we
shouldn't<00:06:48.190> have<00:06:48.340> that<00:06:48.490> again<00:06:48.810> sadly<00:06:49.810> I<00:06:49.870> just
