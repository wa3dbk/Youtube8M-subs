able to get up and down the field and

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:55.180 
able to get up and down the field and
you<00:02:53.959> know<00:02:54.080> with<00:02:54.230> like<00:02:54.319> coach<00:02:54.560> said<00:02:54.590> we<00:02:54.980> got<00:02:55.100> to

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190 
you know with like coach said we got to

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:56.710

be<00:02:55.280> able<00:02:55.370> to<00:02:55.519> run<00:02:55.640> I<00:02:55.670> think<00:02:55.760> it's<00:02:56.000> like<00:02:56.090> 120

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 
be able to run I think it's like 120

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:57.699 
be able to run I think it's like 120
plays<00:02:56.930> a<00:02:56.959> game<00:02:57.230> or<00:02:57.380> something<00:02:57.560> like<00:02:57.620> that

00:02:57.699 --> 00:02:57.709 
plays a game or something like that

00:02:57.709 --> 00:02:59.350 
plays a game or something like that
something<00:02:58.069> like<00:02:58.160> that<00:02:58.400> so<00:02:58.549> it's<00:02:59.090> a<00:02:59.180> lot<00:02:59.299> of

00:02:59.350 --> 00:02:59.360 
something like that so it's a lot of

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.660 
something like that so it's a lot of
place<00:02:59.630> we<00:02:59.900> got<00:03:00.019> to<00:03:00.110> do<00:03:00.200> that<00:03:00.350> the<00:03:01.220> defense<00:03:01.549> has

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:01.670 
place we got to do that the defense has

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:02.710 
place we got to do that the defense has
kind<00:03:01.850> of<00:03:01.880> seemed<00:03:02.090> to<00:03:02.180> pick<00:03:02.299> up<00:03:02.450> this<00:03:02.540> new

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:02.720 
kind of seemed to pick up this new

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.390 
kind of seemed to pick up this new
system<00:03:02.959> a<00:03:03.170> little<00:03:03.200> faster<00:03:03.769> than<00:03:03.799> the<00:03:04.040> offense

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
system a little faster than the offense

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:05.890 
system a little faster than the offense
can<00:03:04.910> you<00:03:05.030> see<00:03:05.180> what<00:03:05.360> the<00:03:05.450> reason<00:03:05.750> for<00:03:05.870> that

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
can you see what the reason for that

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:07.449 
can you see what the reason for that
that's<00:03:06.380> just<00:03:06.470> that's<00:03:06.650> just<00:03:06.799> that's<00:03:07.160> just<00:03:07.280> how
