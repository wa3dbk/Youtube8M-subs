00:00:01.879 --> 00:00:08.849
 so unusual to look at yourself without 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:10.920
 red lipstick as always meaningless 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.840
 was then did not foresee hi friends 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:16.590
 Today our rubric is very relevant 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.970
 reviews will be two lipsticks from flyuit and i 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.010
 I thought that the last time I 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.310
 filmed review on lipstick cast eat then 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:26.220
 Thought need to withdraw reviews on those mods 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.140
 which I like because it can 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.029
 about a month or a half seems to me 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.170
 months I shot a review for another 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:36.210
 a collection of lipstick flyal I will throw the link in 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:38.460
 information about the video and so the lecture was 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.020
 a very good and very cursed but 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.219
 then I will not think there is a good picture 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.329
 fruits need to talk about them just 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:46.410
 to somehow install some 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:49.230
 justice and honor marks so i 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:54.059
 I shoot you a video wire, these two crumbs 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:56.730
 this gun is a desir collection and there are two 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:59.520
 shade the first one is 301 envy 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.079
 and he is left on my lips 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.520
 literally so much I tell you about him 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.409
 told me it seems cosmetics 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.420
 who did not like during 2014 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:09.030
 years and I said something so little left 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.650
 I'm afraid to use to the end and I'm still 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.720
 joked very funny about what 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.610
 because this shade is so lucky 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.290
 that I use it just without ceasing 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.869
 surely you ritual with them 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.030
 reproduction or ha ha ha i said 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.600
 maybe they have already removed this shade from 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.280
 production 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.040
 I was sure that I was joking very funny 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.390
 because I doubt that no matter how kind 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.310
 maybe a company motivation to take off 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.579
 so successful color from production and 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:35.790
 clean shake I went to the site flyuyal 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:37.049
 new online store has come here 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.680
 lipstick collection and 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:42.780
 and guess what you guess are unique and 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.439
 guess you can guess that no one 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.149
 happened before 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.799
 they took off the production and shade they 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:49.110
 out of production and will be given 2 terrorist attacks 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:52.170
 which I will tell later but as if 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.759
 my grief had no barriers and I did not 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.040
 I understand why the whip somehow 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:58.680
 It was I decided that I taught you I hear about 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.270
 these lipsticks are just because the collection 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.040
 there are colors changed but not so 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:05.880
 less i will tell you about the texture itself 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:08.099
 this light is the perfect color for me 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.959
 the best color in the world to this mountain 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:11.890
 come in and I have a lot of rmat you know that 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:14.530
 there is for me such a scythe fit 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:16.680
 really beautiful but be that as it may 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:19.450
 was i tell you about the textures of lipstick and 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.890
 I don't know when next time I myself 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:23.200
 because I stayed for one use 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:25.270
 and I just need to handle it 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.400
 I do n't need it myself, I don't know where it’s special 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:29.590
 event to take your lipstick because 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.060
 really so good these 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:33.310
 lipstick is very mystical to you 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.300
 Demonstrate is applied very easily in 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:36.640
 same time not quite pigmented 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:38.410
 they are too dense less dense than 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.370
 ordinary lipstick but they are rather 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:41.800
 moisturizing 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:43.989
 that is, they are less pigmented by that 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:45.520
 less of us straight as lip balm they 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:45.940
 very soft they are very comfortable on 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:48.280
 lips 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:49.930
 there are a lot of bang this lipstick really 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.090
 It looks like a lip balm so not 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.989
 that it nourishes and moisturizes 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:55.600
 I google for quite a while 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:59.290
 holding on but for moisturizing lipstick you 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:02.019
 some can judge that is about an hour 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:03.489
 maybe a little bit more than an hour my light 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:05.290
 On lipstick in principle, you are a good time 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:07.870
 I wear about two or three layers to 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:09.370
 Now get this color but it is like 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:11.410
 nothing terrible, that is, she is very 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:13.600
 comfortable on the lips she i would say that 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:15.880
 does not spread much and with this shade 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:17.860
 this is not very noticeable next shade 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:19.420
 this is osmosis 312 i'm just you 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:21.040
 I will demonstrate how we let him too 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:21.489
 left a little you see love these 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:26.140
 crumbs 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:28.630
 he is more berry but you see he 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:30.790
 much more pigmented on my 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:33.730
 the lips the oil here is rather red but it 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:35.230
 still need to consider the color of the lips that 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:37.600
 you have because these lipsticks are a little bit 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:39.700
 less dense than let's say matte lipstick 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:41.320
 so they let a little less color but 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.390
 it looks red to us so it is 

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:45.250
 pretty berry again very 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:47.500
 comfortable to wear he's pretty 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:49.720
 resistant to moisturizing lipstick but 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:51.519
 again dark and red colors all 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:53.970
 satisfied with the light than the light and therefore he 

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:56.410
 holding her would say two hours easy 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:57.700
 then you need to send it again this 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:00.910
 I try to wear lipstick 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:03.040
 either with a pencil or said in one 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:04.260
 a layer that is like a little bit of shade 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:07.209
 the village 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:08.530
 when if suddenly it spreads there 

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:10.359
 will not be so important 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:12.910
 or all the same with our City Honor 

00:04:10.359 --> 00:04:15.489
 wear again very comfortable she 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:17.140
 very moisturizes very pleasant and this 

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:18.970
 color is pretty strong this is one of 

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:20.919
 my such populated red because 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:21.609
 Noah country is quite bright on the other 

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:27.460
 side a 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:30.159
 they are too tight and not so not so 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:31.599
 not very good , that is, it is you 

00:04:30.159 --> 00:04:33.729
 series if you need some bright 

00:04:31.599 --> 00:04:36.840
 dirty tricks she stands because she 

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:40.870
 looks pretty appropriate in any 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:42.990
 again it is very difficult to find again 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:45.490
 same one more word parasite which i 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:46.560
 find out from my videos I need him 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:50.469
 fight 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:52.180
 so this lipstick is pretty good 

00:04:50.469 --> 00:04:53.770
 for me new yes simply because 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:55.629
 I have a lot of red lipstick and 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:59.050
 most of them are very bright for example 

00:04:55.629 --> 00:05:02.050
 if i go somewhere there well to work 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:04.870
 or somewhere I don't need too 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:05.469
 bright lips then this is my choice this 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:08.379
 pretty 

00:05:05.469 --> 00:05:11.289
 on strong red lipstick than me again 

00:05:08.379 --> 00:05:13.330
 pretty here it seems like a shade they have me 

00:05:11.289 --> 00:05:15.430
 I do not remember what else the name is 

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:18.129
 rockstar is something else that is in 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:18.729
 such a berry color among their new 

00:05:18.129 --> 00:05:24.430
 shades 

00:05:18.729 --> 00:05:25.900
 there I will try to find it did not have time to know 

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:27.759
 do I go to the beach fly than this video 

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:31.449
 will go to the channel but if I have time I will write 

00:05:27.759 --> 00:05:33.129
 Shade number in the description in general, too 

00:05:31.449 --> 00:05:35.289
 very good shade so just 

00:05:33.129 --> 00:05:37.690
 the collection itself I really like it 

00:05:35.289 --> 00:05:39.219
 as if i will buy new colors from 

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:39.639
 Of course, this collection will not replace anything. 

00:05:39.219 --> 00:05:43.080
 to me 

00:05:39.639 --> 00:05:45.430
 envy is just the perfect color and 

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:46.930
 nothing even close there is no departure in this 

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:49.419
 a new collection but nevertheless themselves 

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:51.279
 colors are very good some pink 

00:05:49.419 --> 00:05:54.219
 shades there is a peach in there 

00:05:51.279 --> 00:05:56.529
 were beige there is red they are 

00:05:54.219 --> 00:05:57.819
 pretty much expanded here the range 

00:05:56.529 --> 00:06:00.759
 its flowers in this collection 

00:05:57.819 --> 00:06:02.229
 so it seems to me that in general I would 

00:06:00.759 --> 00:06:03.879
 I recommended you to take a closer look myself 

00:06:02.229 --> 00:06:05.919
 I will definitely buy more color 

00:06:03.879 --> 00:06:08.050
 because it is a successful collection it 

00:06:05.919 --> 00:06:10.060
 moisturizes so she comfortable lips 

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:11.830
 she absolutely does not dry them that is for 

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:14.110
 me this lipstick for example for the winter then 

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:15.759
 what is needed is lipstick which gives and color 

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:17.009
 and moisturizing here it seems to me 

00:06:15.759 --> 00:06:19.750
 great combination 

00:06:17.009 --> 00:06:20.800
 plus many colors and yet 

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:22.089
 pretty good she doesn't 

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:23.979
 spreads out unlike many 

00:06:22.089 --> 00:06:25.419
 moisturizers here it doesn't spread on 

00:06:23.979 --> 00:06:27.300
 half of your face because i have 

00:06:25.419 --> 00:06:31.560
 there were a variety of cases 

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:33.150
 keeps well in general just perfect 

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:35.539
 lipstick i think in this case 

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:40.650
 letuual did an excellent job 

00:06:35.539 --> 00:06:42.960
 the purpose of this in general i set tiempo madam 

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:44.849
 five out of five for moisturizers they 

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:47.250
 quite stable and give moisture 

00:06:44.849 --> 00:06:48.900
 very much i am very satisfied very much 

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:51.060
 I advise you at least do not look 

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:52.830
 to this shade try like this 

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:54.590
 This texture like well there they do not know 

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:57.090
 Turks with them anywhere 

00:06:54.590 --> 00:07:00.150
 just look first very 

00:06:57.090 --> 00:07:02.400
 highly recommend on this my 

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:04.500
 very timely review ends 

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:06.659
 thank you very much for watching if 

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:08.819
 there are some models of roofing that you 

00:07:06.659 --> 00:07:11.310
 liked that email me because 

00:07:08.819 --> 00:07:13.500
 when I shot you the previous video about 

00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:14.969
 which I cursed these lipsticks many zaz 

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:16.199
 wrote that you also tried lipstick 

00:07:14.969 --> 00:07:19.110
 collections you didn’t like them either 

00:07:16.199 --> 00:07:20.969
 which was a relief for me 

00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:23.340
 because it means that I did not scold 

00:07:20.969 --> 00:07:25.409
 product in vain in general if you need something 

00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:26.729
 I like it from this brand, I will write 

00:07:25.409 --> 00:07:30.440
 glad worth a try and great for you 

00:07:26.729 --> 00:07:30.440
 thanks for watching and love you all
