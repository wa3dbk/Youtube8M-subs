00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:33.380 
don't like the dragging thing there's
another<00:04:32.010> way<00:04:32.160> to<00:04:32.190> do<00:04:32.400> it<00:04:32.490> which<00:04:32.610> is<00:04:32.640> highlight

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:33.390 
another way to do it which is highlight

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:35.980 
another way to do it which is highlight
one<00:04:33.600> and<00:04:33.900> then<00:04:34.470> hold<00:04:34.710> the<00:04:34.860> command<00:04:35.220> key<00:04:35.430> click

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:35.990 
one and then hold the command key click

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:38.930 
one and then hold the command key click
the<00:04:36.990> other<00:04:37.140> and<00:04:37.590> then<00:04:38.430> you<00:04:38.460> can<00:04:38.670> go<00:04:38.790> up<00:04:38.910> to

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:38.940 
the other and then you can go up to

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:41.600 
the other and then you can go up to
events<00:04:39.480> and<00:04:40.380> then<00:04:40.620> create<00:04:40.950> a<00:04:40.980> new<00:04:41.220> one<00:04:41.340> based

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:41.610 
events and then create a new one based

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:46.250 
events and then create a new one based
on<00:04:41.790> those<00:04:41.940> two<00:04:43.730> there<00:04:44.730> we<00:04:44.820> have<00:04:44.970> it<00:04:45.260> although

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:47.810 
on those two there we have it although
it's<00:04:46.650> kind<00:04:46.740> of<00:04:46.860> frustrating<00:04:47.310> about<00:04:47.400> that<00:04:47.670> is

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:47.820

00:05:59.570 --> 00:05:59.580 
best way to take care of this in my

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:01.640 
best way to take care of this in my
