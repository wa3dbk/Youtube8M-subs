for similar to sleep as well and there

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.360 
for similar to sleep as well and there
is<00:02:45.840> a<00:02:45.870> hatch<00:02:46.170> in<00:02:46.200> this<00:02:46.530> compartment<00:02:46.920> so<00:02:47.310> you

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
is a hatch in this compartment so you

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.910 
is a hatch in this compartment so you
can<00:02:47.550> open<00:02:47.670> it<00:02:47.879> up<00:02:47.940> against<00:02:48.300> coup<00:02:48.540> air<00:02:49.260> or<00:02:49.620> warm

there's<00:03:45.300> the<00:03:45.510> radar<00:03:45.900> open<00:03:46.590> array

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:52.309 

around<00:03:49.500> the<00:03:49.620> front<00:03:49.799> we<00:03:50.099> got<00:03:50.250> to<00:03:51.230> cut<00:03:52.230> some

00:03:52.309 --> 00:03:52.319 
around the front we got to cut some

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:54.250 
around the front we got to cut some
ropes<00:03:52.560> up<00:03:52.799> here

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:54.260 
ropes up here

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:59.170 
ropes up here
platform<00:03:55.260> for<00:03:55.470> your<00:03:55.560> anchor<00:03:55.860> roller

00:03:59.170 --> 00:03:59.180 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:04.720 

there's<00:03:59.750> the<00:03:59.870> front<00:04:00.080> windows<00:04:00.500> to<00:04:00.739> pilothouse

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:04.730 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:06.880 

there's<00:04:05.060> the<00:04:05.240> top<00:04:05.480> side<00:04:05.750> at<00:04:05.900> a/c<00:04:06.170> unit<00:04:06.710> and

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:06.890 
there's the top side at a/c unit and

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:08.560 
there's the top side at a/c unit and
then<00:04:07.100> we've<00:04:07.250> got<00:04:07.400> a<00:04:07.430> generator<00:04:07.970> over<00:04:08.300> there<00:04:08.480> as

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:08.570 
then we've got a generator over there as

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:13.560 
then we've got a generator over there as
well<00:04:09.550> told<00:04:10.550> it<00:04:10.730> only<00:04:10.850> has<00:04:11.030> a<00:04:11.060> few<00:04:11.300> hours<00:04:11.360> on<00:04:11.810> it

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:13.570 
well told it only has a few hours on it

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:16.140 
well told it only has a few hours on it
and<00:04:14.570> then<00:04:14.720> this<00:04:14.870> is<00:04:14.930> what<00:04:15.200> we<00:04:15.320> look<00:04:15.440> like<00:04:15.470> in

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:16.150 
and then this is what we look like in

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:18.220 
and then this is what we look like in
the<00:04:17.150> back<00:04:17.329> we'll<00:04:17.570> go<00:04:17.690> take<00:04:17.840> a<00:04:17.900> look<00:04:18.079> at<00:04:18.170> the

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:18.230 
the back we'll go take a look at the

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:27.500 
the back we'll go take a look at the
outside<00:04:18.530> of<00:04:18.590> the<00:04:18.739> Bell<00:04:18.859> cement

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:27.510
