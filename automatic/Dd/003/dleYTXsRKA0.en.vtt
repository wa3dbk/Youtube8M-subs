00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:13.280
Silly Couple Going Out

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:21.500
Tada.

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.400
Cute.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.840
That's it?

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:31.620
You look cute.

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:33.800
You don't mean it.

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:37.320
Your eyes are not sparkling.

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:38.820
It's true. You look cute.

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:40.560
You made me down.

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:42.380
Don't say that.

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:45.760
You know how long it took to
choose this outfit?

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.360
- 2 weeks!
- Really?

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:53.280
- You let me down.
- You look great!

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.680
- The silhouette is awesome.
 Don't Believe you.

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:59.260
You're so mean.

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:05.100
You never know how much I
thought over to buy this.

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.060
Actually, I don't...

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.580
- But it's cute.
- It's okay now.

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.580
I don't want to go now.

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:15.340
Let's go.
We're running out of time.

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.660
It's all your fault.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.700
When I showed up,
you should've told me I was gorgeous.

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:26.360
Then we could have had
good time out together by now.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.840
It's because you didn't say anything...

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:30.440
That's not true.

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:36.440
I told you you are pretty.
The color matches the season.

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.680
You know, it's chic.

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.560
- You are lying. I'm not going.
- I'm not lying.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.020
You're so cute.

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:50.380
I'm not going.
Why your eyes are sparkling now?

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:53.100
- I hate it.
- Don't say that.

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.320
You don't want to walk with me.

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.180
What are you saying?
That's totally not true.

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.160
You're the prettiest in the world.

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.500
- It's true.
- You don't mean it.

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.360
I mean it.

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.000
But it's not bad to hear.

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.740
Great! Then let's go.

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.800
But I can't forgive your attitude.
I'm not going.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.800
Why is that?

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.940
Let's go. You're gorgeous.

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.040
Will you do me a favor?

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.260
I want you to...

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.500
buy me a dress you like.

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:35.380
I bought this dress
because I thought it'll please you.

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:40.940
I spent 2 weeks on choosing it.
But you were not so excited about it.

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:45.780
So it's best that you choose the one
you like.

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:47.760
Please buy me a dress.

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.760
We should go now.

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.880
- I can't in this dress.
- Let's go together.

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.560
You like it yourself, right?

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.600
If you don't like it, I don't.

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:04.120
I like it. It's very chic.

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.500
The silhouette is beautiful.

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.280
Then why weren't you look
happy when I showed up?

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.120
I was just thinking about something else.

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.120
What? Something else?

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:18.520
Something else was more important
than my outfit?!

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:22.280
It's not true! It blew off something else.

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:25.780
But your eyes didn't say that.

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:30.140
I'm sorry, I've been busy at work lately.

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:32.040
I was just thinking about it.

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.660
Work's more important than this dress?

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:37.500
No, the dress is more important.

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.940
- Really?
- Of course!

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:41.120
You get it?

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:45.500
Yeah, that's obvious...
But you're the one who didn't realize it.

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:51.340
If you knew that, your eyes
should've sparkled at that moment.

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:53.480
You're telling non-sence.

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:56.460
Your eyes were dead.

00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:00.520
Is there anything that you don't like
except that?

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:05.100
I'm just talking about how you
reacted. That's all.

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:06.780
How about now?

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:07.500
Now, it's okay.

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.500
You're gorgeous.

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.560
It makes no difference.
I want to play video game.

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:16.700
Forget about video game.

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.340
You shouldn't walk with me
in this outfit.

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:22.080
We made a reservation at a restaurant.

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:25.260
I can't go.
Let's play video game.

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:32.560
Because I can't go out
in this dress.

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:37.220
Why can't you?
You're such a beauty.

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:39.460
I'm proud of you.

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:43.240
No, I know my face is funny.

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:46.880
It's not true.

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:49.920
I know that.
That's why I spent 2 weeks...

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:53.700
Your face is not funny.

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:56.380
Why are you laughing?

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:58.900
Tell me, why are you laughing?

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:02.400
You agree that my face is funny, huh?

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.220
That's why it makes you laugh.

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:09.000
That's it. We should break up.
I can't date you any more.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.460
- You get it wrong.
- Let's break up.

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:16.200
I'll miss you but we should break up.
