machines and as you all know there are

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.920 
machines and as you all know there are
several<00:00:33.329> problems<00:00:33.809> with<00:00:34.579> these<00:00:35.579> machines

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:35.930 
several problems with these machines

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:39.470 
several problems with these machines
first<00:00:36.930> of<00:00:37.050> all<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:38.160> problem<00:00:38.610> of<00:00:38.760> for<00:00:39.360> instance

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
first of all the problem of for instance

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.830 
first of all the problem of for instance
the<00:00:40.399> 5310<00:00:41.399> let's<00:00:42.120> find<00:00:42.390> it

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
the 5310 let's find it

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:49.790 
the 5310 let's find it
Acer<00:00:44.930> 5310<00:00:47.690> the<00:00:48.690> problem<00:00:49.110> with<00:00:49.289> this<00:00:49.440> machine

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
Acer 5310 the problem with this machine

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.959 
Acer 5310 the problem with this machine
my<00:00:50.489> friends<00:00:50.940> is<00:00:51.530> that<00:00:52.530> it's<00:00:53.160> collecting<00:00:53.670> a<00:00:53.789> lot

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
my friends is that it's collecting a lot

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.799 
my friends is that it's collecting a lot
of<00:00:54.090> dust<00:00:54.390> and<00:00:55.370> at<00:00:56.370> that<00:00:56.640> certain<00:00:57.059> point<00:00:57.510> you

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
of dust and at that certain point you

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.020 
of dust and at that certain point you
will<00:00:57.960> get<00:00:58.140> a<00:00:58.350> shutdown<00:00:58.739> problem<00:00:59.430> at<00:00:59.879> the

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
will get a shutdown problem at the

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.080 
will get a shutdown problem at the
moment<00:01:00.180> that<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:01.140> site<00:01:01.379> here<00:01:01.680> gets<00:01:01.980> full<00:01:02.250> then

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
moment that the site here gets full then

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.370 
moment that the site here gets full then
you<00:01:03.690> know<00:01:04.229> the<00:01:04.650> machine<00:01:05.010> won't<00:01:05.339> get<00:01:06.200> too<00:01:07.200> much

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
you know the machine won't get too much

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.560 
you know the machine won't get too much
air<00:01:07.650> anymore<00:01:08.189> and<00:01:08.340> then<00:01:08.850> at<00:01:09.060> a<00:01:09.119> certain<00:01:09.540> moment

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
air anymore and then at a certain moment

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.450 
air anymore and then at a certain moment
it<00:01:10.020> will<00:01:10.170> just<00:01:10.380> shut<00:01:10.590> off<00:01:10.619> just<00:01:11.070> to<00:01:11.250> save

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
it will just shut off just to save

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.730 
it will just shut off just to save
itself<00:01:11.820> you<00:01:12.479> might<00:01:12.630> then<00:01:12.840> want<00:01:12.900> to<00:01:13.200> open<00:01:13.650> the

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
itself you might then want to open the

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.310 
itself you might then want to open the
fan<00:01:13.979> case<00:01:14.250> and<00:01:14.520> then<00:01:14.700> remove<00:01:15.090> the<00:01:15.270> dust<00:01:15.479> but

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
fan case and then remove the dust but

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.780 
fan case and then remove the dust but
sometimes<00:01:17.280> you<00:01:17.909> know<00:01:18.060> especially<00:01:18.600> at<00:01:19.020> the

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
that although this is the 5310 I'm

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:33.429 
that although this is the 5310 I'm
showing<00:01:28.170> you<00:01:28.640> we<00:01:29.640> have<00:01:29.820> to<00:01:29.939> go<00:01:30.090> for<00:01:30.329> the<00:01:30.420> 53:15

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:33.439 

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:36.169 

this<00:01:34.439> one<00:01:34.649> here<00:01:34.890> it's<00:01:35.460> almost<00:01:35.789> the<00:01:36.000> same

00:01:36.169 --> 00:01:36.179 
this one here it's almost the same

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:39.260 
this one here it's almost the same
machine<00:01:36.979> it's<00:01:37.979> in<00:01:38.189> fact<00:01:38.460> the<00:01:38.609> same<00:01:38.850> machine

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
machine it's in fact the same machine

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.969 
machine it's in fact the same machine
only<00:01:39.509> the<00:01:39.840> processor<00:01:40.469> is<00:01:40.789> 1700<00:01:41.789> megahertz<00:01:42.979> but

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
only the processor is 1700 megahertz but

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.340 
only the processor is 1700 megahertz but
by<00:01:44.939> the<00:01:45.000> way<00:01:45.149> this<00:01:45.299> one<00:01:45.479> has<00:01:45.659> a<00:01:45.689> webcam<00:01:45.960> and

by the way this one has a webcam and
some<00:01:47.340> of<00:01:47.460> them<00:01:47.609> has<00:01:47.819> no<00:01:48.030> webcam<00:01:48.509> built-in<00:01:49.610> so

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:51.409 
some of them has no webcam built-in so

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
let me tell you about these machines

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.899 
let me tell you about these machines
when<00:01:54.750> you<00:01:54.929> remove<00:01:55.259> the<00:01:55.439> dust<00:01:55.679> and<00:01:55.950> you<00:01:56.609> still

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:21.600 
I created a map of this thing so you

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.540 
I created a map of this thing so you
know<00:04:21.630> these<00:04:21.960> are<00:04:22.230> very<00:04:22.260> powerful<00:04:23.010> computers

and<00:04:26.010> also<00:04:26.670> update<00:04:27.360> the<00:04:27.390> bias<00:04:27.840> you<00:04:28.620> know<00:04:28.770> to<00:04:28.830> let

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:29.160 
and also update the bias you know to let

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:32.810 
and also update the bias you know to let
this<00:04:29.280> thing<00:04:29.520> work<00:04:29.790> 100%<00:04:30.140> so<00:04:31.140> you<00:04:31.650> know<00:04:31.770> I<00:04:32.340> hope
