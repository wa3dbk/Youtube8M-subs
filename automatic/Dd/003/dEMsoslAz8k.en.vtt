against<00:03:59.380> Tottenham<00:03:59.709> but<00:04:00.269> as<00:04:01.269> seems<00:04:01.600> to<00:04:01.660> be<00:04:01.750> the

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840 
against Tottenham but as seems to be the

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.210 
against Tottenham but as seems to be the
case<00:04:02.050> at<00:04:02.230> the<00:04:02.290> moment<00:04:02.560> we<00:04:02.680> don't<00:04:02.920> seem<00:04:03.130> to

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:03.220 
case at the moment we don't seem to

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:05.430 
case at the moment we don't seem to
better<00:04:03.400> hold<00:04:04.030> on<00:04:04.180> to<00:04:04.330> a<00:04:04.360> lead<00:04:04.630> so<00:04:04.930> we'll<00:04:05.140> see<00:04:05.320> in

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:05.440 
better hold on to a lead so we'll see in

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.380 
better hold on to a lead so we'll see in
this<00:04:05.530> second<00:04:05.890> half<00:04:05.920> now<00:04:06.160> if<00:04:06.459> we<00:04:06.790> actually<00:04:06.940> can
