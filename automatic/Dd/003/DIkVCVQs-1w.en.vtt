00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
I think I should count them are they

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.820 
I think I should count them are they
evenly<00:01:00.690> distributed<00:01:01.440> or<00:01:01.559> not<00:01:03.379> alright<00:01:04.379> so

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
evenly distributed or not alright so

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.100 
evenly distributed or not alright so
yeah<00:01:05.189> it's<00:01:05.519> quite<00:01:05.760> obvious<00:01:05.939> it's<00:01:06.450> not<00:01:06.689> evenly
