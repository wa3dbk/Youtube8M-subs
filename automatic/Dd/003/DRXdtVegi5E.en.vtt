the<00:02:18.000> beginning<00:02:18.300> a<00:02:18.420> trick<00:02:18.780> I<00:02:18.930> showed<00:02:19.260> you<00:02:19.410> two

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
the beginning a trick I showed you two

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.790 
the beginning a trick I showed you two
aces<00:02:20.060> that<00:02:21.060> I<00:02:21.090> then<00:02:21.390> in<00:02:21.630> clip<00:02:21.960> to<00:02:22.140> make<00:02:22.260> sure<00:02:22.530> I

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
aces that I then in clip to make sure I

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.150 
aces that I then in clip to make sure I
couldn't<00:02:23.370> um<00:02:23.840> do<00:02:24.840> anything<00:02:25.200> with<00:02:25.320> them<00:02:25.470> but<00:02:26.040> if

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
couldn't um do anything with them but if

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.760 
couldn't um do anything with them but if
I<00:02:26.340> throw<00:02:26.730> the<00:02:27.090> pack<00:02:27.330> down<00:02:27.660> flips<00:02:28.170> a<00:02:28.320> clip<00:02:28.530> came

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
I throw the pack down flips a clip came

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:32.030 
I throw the pack down flips a clip came
off<00:02:28.980> and<00:02:29.640> very<00:02:30.150> it<00:02:30.420> just<00:02:31.110> like<00:02:31.350> this<00:02:31.590> for<00:02:31.980> a

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
off and very it just like this for a

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.770 
off and very it just like this for a
second<00:02:32.430> let<00:02:32.700> it<00:02:32.820> touch<00:02:34.970> you'll<00:02:35.970> see<00:02:36.270> that<00:02:36.570> in

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
second let it touch you'll see that in

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.610 
second let it touch you'll see that in
pack<00:02:38.000> there's<00:02:39.000> a<00:02:39.210> third<00:02:39.690> card<00:02:40.110> with<00:02:40.350> the<00:02:40.440> two

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
pack there's a third card with the two

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.030 
pack there's a third card with the two
aces<00:02:40.830> and<00:02:41.370> that<00:02:42.000> third<00:02:42.300> card<00:02:42.630> is<00:02:42.930> the<00:02:43.320> selected

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
aces and that third card is the selected

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:49.610 
aces and that third card is the selected
card<00:02:44.370> the<00:02:44.970> six<00:02:45.270> of<00:02:45.510> spades<00:02:47.270> so<00:02:48.440> that's<00:02:49.440> the

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
card the six of spades so that's the

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.620 
card the six of spades so that's the
performance<00:02:49.920> of<00:02:50.190> the<00:02:50.280> trick<00:02:50.550> maybe<00:02:51.210> not<00:02:51.480> the

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
performance of the trick maybe not the

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:55.220 
performance of the trick maybe not the
best<00:02:51.660> but<00:02:52.230> oh<00:02:52.440> well<00:02:52.710> I<00:02:53.690> now<00:02:54.690> here's<00:02:54.960> for<00:02:55.200> the

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
best but oh well I now here's for the

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.340 
best but oh well I now here's for the
tutorial<00:02:55.860> I'm<00:02:56.340> going<00:02:56.580> to<00:02:56.700> do<00:02:57.000> a<00:02:57.080> version<00:02:58.080> of

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
tutorial I'm going to do a version of

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:01.460 
tutorial I'm going to do a version of
the<00:02:58.470> tutorial<00:02:59.070> that<00:02:59.760> you<00:03:00.420> can<00:03:00.660> do<00:03:00.840> we're<00:03:01.320> after

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
the tutorial that you can do we're after

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.890 
the tutorial that you can do we're after
the<00:03:01.740> trick<00:03:02.010> you<00:03:02.250> can<00:03:02.430> actually<00:03:02.640> show<00:03:03.150> the<00:03:03.690> deck

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
the trick you can actually show the deck

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.330 
the trick you can actually show the deck
to<00:03:04.110> the<00:03:04.230> people<00:03:04.590> to<00:03:04.710> show<00:03:04.830> that<00:03:04.950> you<00:03:05.040> didn't

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
to the people to show that you didn't

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.160 
to the people to show that you didn't
have<00:03:05.460> a<00:03:05.490> duplicate<00:03:06.000> obviously<00:03:06.540> you<00:03:06.630> can<00:03:06.780> see<00:03:06.990> I

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
have a duplicate obviously you can see I

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.440 
have a duplicate obviously you can see I
do<00:03:07.500> the<00:03:08.280> reason<00:03:08.610> I<00:03:08.760> didn't<00:03:09.000> do<00:03:09.120> it<00:03:09.270> in<00:03:09.390> my

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
do the reason I didn't do it in my

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:10.640 
do the reason I didn't do it in my
performance<00:03:09.810> is<00:03:10.110> because<00:03:10.320> you<00:03:10.440> need<00:03:10.590> to

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
performance is because you need to

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:13.460 
performance is because you need to
double<00:03:10.800> stick<00:03:11.130> tape<00:03:11.160> on<00:03:11.460> the<00:03:12.150> top<00:03:12.390> and<00:03:12.660> that<00:03:13.230> is

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
double stick tape on the top and that is

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:16.940 
double stick tape on the top and that is
disturbingly<00:03:14.240> visible<00:03:15.240> so<00:03:15.960> and<00:03:16.530> it<00:03:16.710> doesn't

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
disturbingly visible so and it doesn't

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:19.340 
disturbingly visible so and it doesn't
matter<00:03:17.070> that<00:03:17.190> my<00:03:17.460> clip<00:03:17.760> fell<00:03:18.060> we<00:03:18.810> actually

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
matter that my clip fell we actually

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:21.020 
matter that my clip fell we actually
don't<00:03:19.470> need<00:03:19.680> to<00:03:19.740> use<00:03:19.950> it<00:03:20.130> so<00:03:20.220> what<00:03:20.370> you<00:03:20.550> do<00:03:20.790> is

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
don't need to use it so what you do is

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.450 
don't need to use it so what you do is
you<00:03:21.900> basically<00:03:22.110> just<00:03:22.470> present<00:03:23.070> these<00:03:23.250> two

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:23.460 
you basically just present these two

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:25.370 
you basically just present these two
aces<00:03:23.670> and<00:03:24.120> you're<00:03:24.420> gonna<00:03:24.510> hide<00:03:24.780> the<00:03:24.990> six<00:03:25.230> of

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
aces and you're gonna hide the six of

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.620 
aces and you're gonna hide the six of
spades<00:03:25.650> high<00:03:26.040> in<00:03:26.100> one<00:03:26.460> of<00:03:26.550> the<00:03:26.640> aces<00:03:27.030> you<00:03:27.570> can

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630 
spades high in one of the aces you can

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:29.510 
spades high in one of the aces you can
say<00:03:27.870> if<00:03:27.990> two<00:03:28.200> aces<00:03:28.380> here<00:03:28.830> you<00:03:28.950> make<00:03:29.130> sure<00:03:29.370> that

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:29.520 
say if two aces here you make sure that

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:32.960 
say if two aces here you make sure that
the<00:03:30.350> six<00:03:31.350> then<00:03:31.770> gets<00:03:32.100> sandwiched<00:03:32.520> after<00:03:32.880> you

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
the six then gets sandwiched after you

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:35.150 
the six then gets sandwiched after you
clip<00:03:33.210> it<00:03:33.330> in<00:03:33.480> you<00:03:33.630> can<00:03:33.780> do<00:03:33.960> it<00:03:34.110> off<00:03:34.620> the<00:03:34.680> deck

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160 
clip it in you can do it off the deck

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.990 
clip it in you can do it off the deck
where<00:03:35.930> you<00:03:36.930> do<00:03:37.380> one<00:03:37.680> and<00:03:37.950> then<00:03:38.580> you<00:03:38.700> would<00:03:38.820> do<00:03:38.970> a

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
where you do one and then you would do a

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.630 
where you do one and then you would do a
double<00:03:39.630> lift<00:03:39.990> with<00:03:40.590> the<00:03:40.740> other<00:03:40.860> two<00:03:41.190> there's

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:24.840 
you do this is this card force that I

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:26.260 
you do this is this card force that I
used<00:04:25.169> I've<00:04:25.440> seen<00:04:25.710> it<00:04:25.830> in<00:04:25.919> one

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:26.270 
used I've seen it in one

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:27.909 
used I've seen it in one
their<00:04:26.389> video<00:04:26.629> so<00:04:26.810> I<00:04:26.840> decided<00:04:27.379> to<00:04:27.500> do<00:04:27.650> it<00:04:27.800> so<00:04:27.889> I

00:04:27.909 --> 00:04:27.919 
their video so I decided to do it so I

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:30.300 
their video so I decided to do it so I
could<00:04:28.069> do<00:04:28.129> a<00:04:28.160> tutorial<00:04:28.490> on<00:04:29.030> that<00:04:29.090> one<00:04:29.419> as<00:04:29.509> well

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:30.310 
could do a tutorial on that one as well

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:35.559 
could do a tutorial on that one as well
is<00:04:31.310> any<00:04:31.669> number<00:04:31.849> you<00:04:32.120> choose<00:04:33.759> I'm<00:04:34.759> burping

00:04:35.559 --> 00:04:35.569 
is any number you choose I'm burping

00:04:35.569 --> 00:04:38.260 
is any number you choose I'm burping
any<00:04:36.050> number<00:04:36.349> you<00:04:36.379> choose<00:04:36.470> from<00:04:36.979> 10<00:04:37.220> to<00:04:37.340> 20<00:04:37.759> if

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:38.270 
any number you choose from 10 to 20 if

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:39.999 
any number you choose from 10 to 20 if
you<00:04:38.360> add<00:04:38.690> the<00:04:38.900> digits<00:04:39.259> together<00:04:39.470> and<00:04:39.889> then

00:04:39.999 --> 00:04:40.009 
you add the digits together and then

00:04:40.009 --> 00:04:42.309 
you add the digits together and then
subtract<00:04:40.610> the<00:04:40.879> sum<00:04:41.210> of<00:04:41.240> the<00:04:41.449> digits<00:04:41.659> from<00:04:41.960> the

00:04:42.309 --> 00:04:42.319 
subtract the sum of the digits from the

00:04:42.319 --> 00:04:45.339 
subtract the sum of the digits from the
original<00:04:42.710> number<00:04:43.009> you<00:04:43.400> get<00:04:43.580> 9<00:04:43.819> take<00:04:44.479> 11<00:04:44.960> sum<00:04:45.259> of

00:04:45.339 --> 00:04:45.349 
original number you get 9 take 11 sum of

00:04:45.349 --> 00:04:48.850 
original number you get 9 take 11 sum of
the<00:04:45.409> digits<00:04:45.590> is<00:04:45.860> to<00:04:46.039> 11<00:04:46.520> minus<00:04:46.669> 2<00:04:47.060> is<00:04:47.389> 9<00:04:47.720> take<00:04:48.409> 14

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:48.860 
the digits is to 11 minus 2 is 9 take 14

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:52.300 
the digits is to 11 minus 2 is 9 take 14
sum<00:04:49.250> of<00:04:49.340> the<00:04:49.400> 14<00:04:50.000> digits<00:04:50.750> is<00:04:50.870> 5<00:04:51.110> 14<00:04:51.650> minus<00:04:51.889> 5<00:04:52.099> is

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:52.310 
sum of the 14 digits is 5 14 minus 5 is

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:55.420 
sum of the 14 digits is 5 14 minus 5 is
9<00:04:52.580> anyway<00:04:53.330> if<00:04:53.539> you<00:04:53.720> deal<00:04:54.020> any<00:04:54.349> number<00:04:54.800> 10<00:04:55.009> to<00:04:55.099> 20

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:55.430 
9 anyway if you deal any number 10 to 20

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:57.339 
9 anyway if you deal any number 10 to 20
on<00:04:55.610> the<00:04:55.729> deck<00:04:55.940> and<00:04:56.090> then<00:04:56.389> you<00:04:56.539> deal<00:04:56.810> from<00:04:57.289> that

00:04:57.339 --> 00:04:57.349 
on the deck and then you deal from that

00:04:57.349 --> 00:04:58.930 
on the deck and then you deal from that
little<00:04:57.979> pack<00:04:58.250> which<00:04:58.550> would<00:04:58.729> be<00:04:58.849> you

00:04:58.930 --> 00:04:58.940 
little pack which would be you

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:01.120 
little pack which would be you
subtracting<00:04:59.659> the<00:05:00.169> sum<00:05:00.440> of<00:05:00.500> the<00:05:00.620> digits<00:05:00.770> you

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:01.130 
subtracting the sum of the digits you

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:04.270 
subtracting the sum of the digits you
get<00:05:01.310> to<00:05:01.490> the<00:05:01.580> ninth<00:05:01.759> card<00:05:02.500> so<00:05:03.500> hopefully<00:05:04.130> that

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:04.280 
get to the ninth card so hopefully that

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:05.559 
get to the ninth card so hopefully that
makes<00:05:04.310> sense<00:05:04.669> if<00:05:04.880> you<00:05:04.940> just<00:05:05.060> put<00:05:05.240> in<00:05:05.330> the<00:05:05.389> 9th

00:05:05.559 --> 00:05:05.569 
makes sense if you just put in the 9th

00:05:05.569 --> 00:05:08.680 
makes sense if you just put in the 9th
position<00:05:05.750> do<00:05:06.199> what<00:05:06.319> I<00:05:06.349> do<00:05:06.440> it'll<00:05:06.979> work<00:05:07.250> ok<00:05:07.699> so<00:05:08.389> I

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:08.690 
position do what I do it'll work ok so I

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:11.020 
position do what I do it'll work ok so I
have<00:05:09.380> them<00:05:09.560> selected<00:05:09.740> numbered<00:05:10.340> you<00:05:10.699> can<00:05:10.849> just

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:11.030 
have them selected numbered you can just

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:15.249 
have them selected numbered you can just
say<00:05:11.120> it's<00:05:11.270> 14<00:05:11.690> 1<00:05:11.930> 2<00:05:12.199> 3<00:05:12.530> 4<00:05:12.979> 5<00:05:13.280> 6<00:05:13.580> 7<00:05:13.880> 8<00:05:14.150> 9<00:05:14.419> 10<00:05:14.780> 11<00:05:14.990> 12

00:05:15.249 --> 00:05:15.259 
say it's 14 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12

00:05:15.259 --> 00:05:17.950 
say it's 14 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12
13<00:05:15.650> 14<00:05:16.250> the<00:05:17.060> reason<00:05:17.360> you<00:05:17.449> deal<00:05:17.630> from<00:05:17.870> the

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:17.960 
13 14 the reason you deal from the

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:21.189 
13 14 the reason you deal from the
bottom<00:05:18.319> is<00:05:18.500> so<00:05:18.860> you<00:05:19.210> don't<00:05:20.210> deal<00:05:20.599> anything<00:05:21.050> on

00:05:21.189 --> 00:05:21.199 
bottom is so you don't deal anything on

00:05:21.199 --> 00:05:23.110 
bottom is so you don't deal anything on
your<00:05:21.380> double<00:05:21.620> stick<00:05:21.860> tape<00:05:21.889> it<00:05:22.669> would<00:05:22.940> work

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:23.120 
your double stick tape it would work

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:24.760 
your double stick tape it would work
from<00:05:23.360> the<00:05:23.449> top<00:05:23.659> and<00:05:23.840> it<00:05:23.960> does<00:05:24.110> another<00:05:24.379> tricks

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:24.770 
from the top and it does another tricks

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:27.700 
from the top and it does another tricks
not<00:05:25.340> this<00:05:25.550> one<00:05:25.789> cuz<00:05:26.030> the<00:05:26.240> tape<00:05:26.690> on<00:05:26.960> the<00:05:27.080> top<00:05:27.289> and

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:27.710 
not this one cuz the tape on the top and

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:31.990 
not this one cuz the tape on the top and
then<00:05:28.340> you<00:05:28.520> do<00:05:28.819> the<00:05:29.569> sum<00:05:30.289> of<00:05:30.319> the<00:05:30.469> digits<00:05:30.650> 14<00:05:31.490> 1<00:05:31.759> 4

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:32.000 
then you do the sum of the digits 14 1 4

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.490 
then you do the sum of the digits 14 1 4
5<00:05:32.240> 1<00:05:32.900> 2<00:05:32.930> 3<00:05:33.259> 4<00:05:33.800> 5<00:05:34.729> deal<00:05:35.539> them<00:05:35.750> their<00:05:35.900> card<00:05:36.169> you

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:36.500 
5 1 2 3 4 5 deal them their card you

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:38.260 
5 1 2 3 4 5 deal them their card you
just<00:05:36.740> force<00:05:36.949> the<00:05:37.099> six<00:05:37.310> of<00:05:37.460> Spades<00:05:37.669> on<00:05:37.819> really

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:38.270 
just force the six of Spades on really

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:40.059 
just force the six of Spades on really
you<00:05:38.360> can<00:05:38.539> force<00:05:38.750> it<00:05:38.960> on<00:05:39.110> them<00:05:39.560> any<00:05:39.860> way<00:05:40.009> you

00:05:40.059 --> 00:05:40.069 
you can force it on them any way you

00:05:40.069 --> 00:05:41.040 
you can force it on them any way you
want

00:05:43.689 --> 00:05:43.699 
then for the double stick tape version

00:05:43.699 --> 00:05:45.839 
then for the double stick tape version

00:05:55.839 --> 00:05:55.849 
to get it stuck there on the top a

00:05:55.849 --> 00:05:57.939 
to get it stuck there on the top a
little<00:05:56.060> bit<00:05:56.210> and<00:05:57.139> it<00:05:57.289> is<00:05:57.409> in<00:05:57.560> the<00:05:57.650> middle<00:05:57.860> but

00:05:59.649 --> 00:05:59.659 
you stuck it to the top card so that

00:05:59.659 --> 00:06:02.050 
you stuck it to the top card so that
it'll<00:05:59.810> be<00:06:00.020> hidden<00:06:00.289> if<00:06:00.650> you<00:06:00.830> show<00:06:01.520> the<00:06:01.669> deck<00:06:01.880> to

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:02.060

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:04.059 
it'll be hidden if you show the deck to
them<00:06:02.240> then<00:06:02.779> these<00:06:02.990> pack<00:06:03.380> of<00:06:03.560> cards<00:06:03.830> have<00:06:03.949> been

00:06:04.059 --> 00:06:04.069 
them then these pack of cards have been

00:06:04.069 --> 00:06:05.740 
them then these pack of cards have been
clipped<00:06:04.340> I<00:06:04.520> didn't<00:06:04.729> clip<00:06:04.880> it<00:06:04.969> in<00:06:05.060> the<00:06:05.150> tutorial

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:05.750 
clipped I didn't clip it in the tutorial

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:06.909 
clipped I didn't clip it in the tutorial
and<00:06:05.840> then<00:06:05.930> you<00:06:06.020> could<00:06:06.169> take<00:06:06.319> the<00:06:06.469> clips<00:06:06.710> off

00:06:06.909 --> 00:06:06.919

00:06:06.919 --> 00:06:08.620 
and then you could take the clips off
you<00:06:07.400> can<00:06:07.520> like<00:06:07.669> put<00:06:07.849> it<00:06:07.940> in<00:06:08.060> the<00:06:08.150> deck<00:06:08.360> you<00:06:08.509> can

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:08.630 
you can like put it in the deck you can

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:09.999 
you can like put it in the deck you can
throw<00:06:08.870> the<00:06:09.020> pack<00:06:09.229> while<00:06:09.469> it's<00:06:09.560> still<00:06:09.710> clipped

00:06:09.999 --> 00:06:10.009 
throw the pack while it's still clipped

00:06:10.009 --> 00:06:12.339 
throw the pack while it's still clipped
and<00:06:10.219> show<00:06:10.460> that<00:06:11.000> the<00:06:11.150> car<00:06:11.360> that<00:06:11.509> they<00:06:11.630> chose<00:06:11.960> is

00:06:12.339 --> 00:06:12.349 
and show that the car that they chose is

00:06:12.349 --> 00:06:14.800 
and show that the car that they chose is
in<00:06:12.650> there<00:06:12.889> brilliant<00:06:13.699> and<00:06:14.270> then<00:06:14.479> if<00:06:14.599> you<00:06:14.719> use

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:14.810 
in there brilliant and then if you use

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:16.240 
in there brilliant and then if you use
the<00:06:15.139> double<00:06:15.440> stick<00:06:15.650> tape<00:06:15.680> and<00:06:16.099> it<00:06:16.159> was

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:16.250 
the double stick tape and it was

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:18.040 
the double stick tape and it was
invisible<00:06:16.759> and<00:06:16.849> everything<00:06:17.270> then<00:06:17.659> you<00:06:17.750> can<00:06:17.930> go

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:18.050 
invisible and everything then you can go

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:20.800 
invisible and everything then you can go
through<00:06:18.289> the<00:06:18.380> cards<00:06:18.770> briefly<00:06:19.449> ensure<00:06:20.449> there's

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:20.810 
through the cards briefly ensure there's

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:24.459 
through the cards briefly ensure there's
no<00:06:20.900> 6<00:06:21.710> of<00:06:21.919> spades<00:06:22.069> in<00:06:22.610> there<00:06:23.419> at<00:06:23.539> all<00:06:23.630> so<00:06:23.990> there

00:06:24.459 --> 00:06:24.469 
no 6 of spades in there at all so there

00:06:24.469 --> 00:06:25.779 
no 6 of spades in there at all so there
are<00:06:24.500> no<00:06:24.919> duplicates

00:06:25.779 --> 00:06:25.789 
are no duplicates

00:06:25.789 --> 00:06:27.760 
are no duplicates
I<00:06:25.909> feel<00:06:26.539> the<00:06:26.659> effect<00:06:26.960> is<00:06:27.110> much<00:06:27.229> stronger<00:06:27.560> that

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:27.770 
I feel the effect is much stronger that

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:30.850 
I feel the effect is much stronger that
way<00:06:27.919> but<00:06:28.400> in<00:06:28.699> my<00:06:28.969> performance<00:06:29.810> head<00:06:30.259> I<00:06:30.289> used<00:06:30.620> it

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:30.860 
way but in my performance head I used it

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:34.629 
way but in my performance head I used it
I<00:06:31.069> would<00:06:31.430> have<00:06:31.490> looked<00:06:31.699> pretty<00:06:32.150> silly<00:06:33.639> so

00:06:34.629 --> 00:06:34.639 
I would have looked pretty silly so

00:06:34.639 --> 00:06:36.279 
I would have looked pretty silly so
again<00:06:35.000> I<00:06:35.029> don't<00:06:35.180> know<00:06:35.330> the<00:06:35.509> title<00:06:36.050> of<00:06:36.110> this

00:06:36.279 --> 00:06:36.289 
again I don't know the title of this

00:06:36.289 --> 00:06:37.839 
again I don't know the title of this
trick<00:06:36.589> I'll<00:06:36.949> have<00:06:37.219> one

00:06:37.839 --> 00:06:37.849
