00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:12.650
 Hello, well, here is the chef carme 

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:14.480
 preparing my meals for tomorrow 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:15.740
 I'm going to say that put in the morning and 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:17.330
 for the rest of the week 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:20.090
 well actually not for then the 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:22.429
 week but as we say from here to the 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:24.050
 Wednesday and the best known state 

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:28.160
 extend that be for Thursday and 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:31.150
 Friday as good here I have some 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:34.579
 oats that jacko if there is something else that 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:36.680
 I had to be very relaxed to 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:38.150
 cooking is extensive as taking a 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:42.829
 wine glass that you already know is 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:45.020
 allowed and this is so I do not 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:47.930
 I'm leaving the program we're fine 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:51.109
 nothing happens I relax but richer more 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:54.219
 relaxed and lighter 

00:00:51.109 --> 00:00:56.090
 well here I have oatmeal that already prepare 

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:57.980
 obviously I put it in the continuous 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:00.550
 large and then medium work in 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:03.470
 this case oats is a carbohydrate 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:06.710
 healthy that is measured in the yellow 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:08.450
 and then I have the quinoa also prepare 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:11.060
 a cup of quinoa and here I go 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:12.440
 grabbing during the week to put it 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.540
 in the container that is another 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:18.230
 healthy carbohydrate and goes on the 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:21.980
 yellow here I have a mixture of 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:25.180
 vegetables I actually have because you can 

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:29.530

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:33.280
 Broccoli, I call you little sprouts 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:36.640
 what or a little bit of corn 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:39.310
 chicharito and little carrots good 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:42.070
 obviously my toys that 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:44.290
 we were in what I'm going to measure the 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:47.440
 food here I already have 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:49.180
 the quinoa ready to put the protein 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:52.390
 once you congratulate what I am 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:55.240

 Greek yogurt tomorrow something with a little 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:04.899
 of coconut and chia seeds incredible 

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:07.750
 it seems that it almost does not fit this 

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:10.000
 container to this orange but then 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:11.380
 here is enough is to be like 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.840
 pajarito environment where you still 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:16.150
 work eating are issued are military and 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.069

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.930
 that I in which I am I as two 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:23.769
 lots of fruits that obviously the 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:26.950
 fruit goes in this purple container the 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:29.800
 measure the grapes the orange I'm ready 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:31.560
 and I have another portion of protein in 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:34.590
 this case then on Saturday 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:36.900
 not enough also of my meals and then 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:40.319
 good here 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:43.349
 we have the coach parked because 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:46.110
 I tell them I'm not a cook I'm not the 

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:49.099
 better person in the kitchen but then 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:52.140
 I like to invent here I have a topo 

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:53.879
 I just put a little bit of you can 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:56.879
 appreciate well here all I put a little 

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:58.530
 of pepper salt a little bit down and here 

00:02:56.879 --> 00:03:00.480
 back I have very chile 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:03.290
 chipotle only goes with a little chili 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:05.360
 chipotle and this is going to be the protein 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:08.569
 like good mexicana us the chile so is 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:10.310
 I said tofu is from those of the 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:12.319
 condiments or the foods that 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:13.760
 adapt the flavor of what you put 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:17.060
 so right now it smells 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:19.860
 I tell you I was hungry a very rich 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:22.260
 with the to remove the 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:26.010
 the pepper and I'll put it here back 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:28.650
 I have the chipotle and here I have a 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:31.100
 chick the fact the chick I put it to 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:36.420
 Marinate with a little wine 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:38.940
 just with salt and pepper and it was 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:40.830
 everything really then was 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:43.560
 manipulating marinating a couple of hours in 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:47.010
 the rest and that's why a little 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:49.320
 purple because you put some wine 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:52.680
 because not if I take it because I do not 

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:54.880
 as true then then here I am 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:57.880
 preparing meals 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:59.620
 and my proteins are almost ready now 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:03.370
 that are ready, I keep them in another 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:04.960
 pan cited guys already really know the 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:06.850
 true to say you do not get tired of 

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:10.150
 eat the same thing because the truth is not because 

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:12.640
 or like the same thing for at least three days or 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:14.590
 ended up eating junk food and then 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:16.450
 in the case in my case I prefer as 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:18.850
 the same I am very busy during the 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:21.190
 week and I I'll put not cook 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:23.350
 every day so that for me that what 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:25.840
 that works have to look and see that 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:27.610
 it works for you and if you can 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:29.380
 cook every day how delicious what 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:31.990
 envy I wish I could have the time 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:34.150
 but it 's what works for me happy about 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:36.970
 life came to my work with all my 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:38.800
 containers the already measured foods and 

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:41.440
 I do not have to worry about what I'm going to 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:44.200
 eat in fact until my puppies 

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:47.200
 cook and of course they have to eat rich 

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:49.060
 healthy as mom and well then here 

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:51.430

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:54.070

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:56.740
 organize with your meals the truth the 

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:59.410
 secret and these three successes are my 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:02.080
 Little toys in the kitchen fascinate me 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:03.550
 I can tell you if I eat healthy rich 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:05.980
 this is not diet this is learning to 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:07.870
 eat with the right people and 

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:09.760
