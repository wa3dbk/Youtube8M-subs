this very easy function to work round

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:23.730 
this very easy function to work round
but<00:00:21.449> okay<00:00:22.449> connect<00:00:22.810> run<00:00:23.350> to<00:00:23.560> you<00:00:23.619> in<00:00:23.680> the

but okay connect run to you in the

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:25.320 
but okay connect run to you in the
studio<00:00:23.800> make<00:00:24.430> sure<00:00:24.460> your<00:00:24.699> connected<00:00:24.820> to<00:00:25.210> the

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:25.330 
studio make sure your connected to the

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:30.179 
studio make sure your connected to the
ECU<00:00:25.990> and<00:00:26.020> the<00:00:26.350> ignitions<00:00:26.800> on<00:00:28.980> basically<00:00:29.980> as

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:30.189 
ECU and the ignitions on basically as

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:33.420 
ECU and the ignitions on basically as
soon<00:00:30.220> as<00:00:30.490> you<00:00:30.580> start<00:00:30.850> date<00:00:31.090> logging<00:00:32.280> and<00:00:33.280> you

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:33.430 
soon as you start date logging and you

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:37.410 
soon as you start date logging and you
suddenly<00:00:33.640> save<00:00:34.150> the<00:00:34.360> file<00:00:34.600> and<00:00:36.059> tuning<00:00:37.059> studio

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:37.420 
suddenly save the file and tuning studio

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:39.840 
suddenly save the file and tuning studio
starts<00:00:37.809> to<00:00:38.050> record<00:00:38.800> that<00:00:38.949> date<00:00:39.159> log<00:00:39.370> and<00:00:39.640> then

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:39.850 
starts to record that date log and then

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:42.600 
starts to record that date log and then
the<00:00:40.000> sims<00:00:40.269> 2<00:00:40.420> news<00:00:40.720> studio<00:00:40.989> is<00:00:41.229> stopped<00:00:41.650> now

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:42.610 
the sims 2 news studio is stopped now

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:44.640 
the sims 2 news studio is stopped now
you<00:00:42.670> shut<00:00:43.120> it<00:00:43.269> down<00:00:43.449> or<00:00:43.780> you<00:00:43.900> stop<00:00:44.170> date<00:00:44.409> log

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:44.650 
you shut it down or you stop date log

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:47.340 
you shut it down or you stop date log
and<00:00:44.830> then<00:00:45.040> that<00:00:45.220> day<00:00:45.370> clock<00:00:45.580> stops<00:00:46.199> so<00:00:47.199> it's

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:47.350 
and then that day clock stops so it's

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:49.410 
and then that day clock stops so it's
important<00:00:47.860> that<00:00:48.100> you<00:00:48.129> can<00:00:48.640> realize<00:00:49.180> that<00:00:49.330> they

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:49.420 
important that you can realize that they

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:51.840 
important that you can realize that they
don't<00:00:49.659> just<00:00:49.979> connecting<00:00:50.979> the<00:00:51.100> studio<00:00:51.460> to<00:00:51.699> it

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:51.850 
don't just connecting the studio to it

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:54.960 
don't just connecting the studio to it
and<00:00:52.030> preference<00:00:52.690> record<00:00:53.470> what's<00:00:53.979> happened<00:00:54.460> it

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:54.970 
and preference record what's happened it

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:57.240 
and preference record what's happened it
only<00:00:55.089> records<00:00:55.360> what<00:00:55.809> it's<00:00:56.019> seeing<00:00:56.440> at<00:00:57.010> them

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:57.250 
only records what it's seeing at them

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:59.180 
only records what it's seeing at them
they're<00:00:57.430> bad<00:00:57.610> once<00:00:57.940> you<00:00:58.030> start<00:00:58.330> date<00:00:58.570> logging

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
they're bad once you start date logging

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.430 
they're bad once you start date logging
okay<00:01:00.190> so<00:01:00.250> up<00:01:00.580> top<00:01:00.850> gusta<00:01:01.299> date<00:01:01.600> logging<00:01:01.989> start

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:02.440 
okay so up top gusta date logging start

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.550 
okay so up top gusta date logging start
date<00:01:02.680> logging<00:01:03.780> and<00:01:04.780> you<00:01:04.869> get<00:01:05.019> the<00:01:05.080> box<00:01:05.290> up

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:05.560 
date logging and you get the box up

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.319 
date logging and you get the box up
where<00:01:06.280> rich<00:01:06.490> you're<00:01:06.609> going<00:01:06.729> to<00:01:06.789> save<00:01:07.000> on<00:01:07.180> what

00:01:07.319 --> 00:01:07.329 
where rich you're going to save on what

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
little bit different because you'll have

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:12.509 
little bit different because you'll have
a<00:03:11.019> link<00:03:11.230> running<00:03:11.590> engine<00:03:11.890> rather<00:03:12.070> than<00:03:12.250> just

00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:12.519 
a link running engine rather than just

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:15.100 
me sitting in a workshop and you can

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:19.710 
me sitting in a workshop and you can

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:31.180 
so we've got rpm in yellow you will see

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:34.650 
so we've got rpm in yellow you will see
