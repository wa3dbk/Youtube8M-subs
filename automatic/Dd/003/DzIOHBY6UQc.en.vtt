00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:35.480 
you end up what you have to do for this

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.640 
you end up what you have to do for this
is<00:00:35.540> you<00:00:35.629> take<00:00:35.900> one<00:00:36.760> really<00:00:37.760> long<00:00:37.910> piece<00:00:38.210> of

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:38.650 
is you take one really long piece of

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:41.650 
is you take one really long piece of
waxed<00:00:39.650> thread<00:00:39.890> that's<00:00:40.460> twice<00:00:41.239> your<00:00:41.420> arm's

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:41.660 
waxed thread that's twice your arm's

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:45.460 
waxed thread that's twice your arm's
length<00:00:41.750> and<00:00:42.170> you<00:00:43.160> thread<00:00:43.489> your<00:00:44.450> needles<00:00:45.379> on

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:45.470 
length and you thread your needles on

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:47.110 
length and you thread your needles on
both<00:00:45.590> ends<00:00:45.890> all<00:00:46.430> right<00:00:46.550> so<00:00:46.730> you<00:00:46.820> have<00:00:46.910> a<00:00:46.940> needle

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:47.120 
both ends all right so you have a needle

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:48.250 
both ends all right so you have a needle
on<00:00:47.180> both<00:00:47.360> its<00:00:47.480> and<00:00:47.600> you<00:00:47.660> feed<00:00:47.840> it<00:00:47.930> through<00:00:47.960> once

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:48.260 
on both its and you feed it through once

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.740 
on both its and you feed it through once
and<00:00:48.559> so<00:00:49.220> you<00:00:49.340> have<00:00:49.489> the<00:00:50.000> thread<00:00:50.239> goes<00:00:50.449> through

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:50.750 
and so you have the thread goes through

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.229 
and so you have the thread goes through
the<00:00:51.440> material<00:00:51.950> back<00:00:52.310> over<00:00:52.850> here<00:00:53.000> is<00:00:53.090> where<00:00:53.210> I

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:53.239 
the material back over here is where I

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:55.690 
the material back over here is where I
started<00:00:53.570> and<00:00:53.780> then<00:00:54.190> what<00:00:55.190> you<00:00:55.280> do<00:00:55.400> is<00:00:55.430> you<00:00:55.579> end

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:55.700 
started and then what you do is you end

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:58.150 
started and then what you do is you end
up<00:00:55.760> Criss<00:00:56.030> crossing<00:00:56.480> your<00:00:56.600> stitches<00:00:56.960> as<00:00:57.860> you

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:58.160 
up Criss crossing your stitches as you

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.750 
up Criss crossing your stitches as you
walk<00:00:58.640> your<00:00:58.820> way<00:00:58.970> down<00:00:59.210> through<00:00:59.930> the<00:01:00.079> material

walk your way down through the material

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:02.770 
walk your way down through the material
the<00:01:01.760> way<00:01:01.850> you<00:01:01.910> mark<00:01:02.180> your<00:01:02.239> material<00:01:02.630> is<00:01:02.690> they

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:02.780 
the way you mark your material is they

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:04.540 
the way you mark your material is they
have<00:01:02.899> like<00:01:03.079> an<00:01:03.200> edger<00:01:03.380> that<00:01:04.009> comes<00:01:04.250> in<00:01:04.339> here

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:04.550 
have like an edger that comes in here

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:08.080 
have like an edger that comes in here
and<00:01:04.699> it<00:01:04.820> cuts<00:01:05.030> up<00:01:05.180> cuts<00:01:06.080> a<00:01:06.170> groove<00:01:06.200> and<00:01:07.090> inside

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:08.090 
and it cuts up cuts a groove and inside

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:09.639 
and it cuts up cuts a groove and inside
that<00:01:08.119> groove<00:01:08.450> is<00:01:08.600> where<00:01:08.780> your<00:01:09.110> stitches<00:01:09.470> will

00:01:09.639 --> 00:01:09.649 
that groove is where your stitches will

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:12.760 
that groove is where your stitches will
be<00:01:09.830> recessed<00:01:10.670> so<00:01:10.880> your<00:01:11.300> butt<00:01:11.840> won't<00:01:12.020> rub<00:01:12.320> the

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:12.770 
be recessed so your butt won't rub the

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.340 
be recessed so your butt won't rub the
threads<00:01:13.130> and<00:01:13.310> cause<00:01:13.550> them<00:01:13.759> to<00:01:13.880> come<00:01:14.000> off<00:01:14.350> the

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:15.350 
threads and cause them to come off the

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:16.630 
threads and cause them to come off the
way<00:01:15.440> you<00:01:15.470> mark<00:01:15.800> your<00:01:15.890> threads<00:01:16.250> is<00:01:16.399> you<00:01:16.490> use<00:01:16.610> a

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:16.640 
way you mark your threads is you use a

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.850 
way you mark your threads is you use a
stitching<00:01:17.149> wheel<00:01:17.270> or<00:01:17.479> a<00:01:17.540> over<00:01:17.960> stitch<00:01:18.649> wheel

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:18.860 
stitching wheel or a over stitch wheel

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:20.830 
stitching wheel or a over stitch wheel
and<00:01:19.160> that<00:01:19.940> writes<00:01:20.180> right<00:01:20.420> in<00:01:20.509> this<00:01:20.630> groove

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:20.840 
and that writes right in this groove

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:26.719 
and that writes right in this groove
news

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.270 

okay<00:01:27.729> so<00:01:27.790> this<00:01:28.060> is<00:01:28.240> a<00:01:28.320> needle<00:01:29.320> that<00:01:29.830> we<00:01:29.950> use<00:01:30.100> to

needle used for sewing this is the

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:42.710 
needle used for sewing this is the
stitching<00:01:40.420> awl<00:01:40.570> it's<00:01:40.840> a<00:01:40.960> it's<00:01:41.799> basically<00:01:42.430> a

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
stitching awl it's a it's basically a

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:47.560 
dull so you have to sharpen them on your

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:49.770 
dull so you have to sharpen them on your
your<00:01:48.130> wet<00:01:48.250> stones<00:01:48.490> you<00:01:48.640> end<00:01:48.759> up<00:01:48.850> stabbing<00:01:49.119> this

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:49.780 
your wet stones you end up stabbing this

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:51.210 
your wet stones you end up stabbing this
is<00:01:49.960> your<00:01:50.080> stone<00:01:50.200> you<00:01:50.380> end<00:01:50.500> up<00:01:50.560> stabbing<00:01:50.799> this

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:51.220 
is your stone you end up stabbing this

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:53.580 
is your stone you end up stabbing this
way<00:01:51.369> on<00:01:52.000> all<00:01:52.210> four<00:01:52.509> sides<00:01:52.540> because<00:01:53.290> it's<00:01:53.440> got

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:53.590 
way on all four sides because it's got

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.899 
way on all four sides because it's got
two<00:01:54.490> four<00:01:54.970> facets<00:01:55.420> on<00:01:55.570> it<00:01:55.720> so<00:01:55.899> and<00:01:56.440> it's<00:01:56.909> that's

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:57.909 
two four facets on it so and it's that's

00:01:57.909 --> 00:01:59.460 
two four facets on it so and it's that's
held<00:01:58.119> securely<00:01:58.390> with<00:01:58.660> this<00:01:58.780> kind<00:01:59.050> of<00:01:59.080> call<00:01:59.320> it

00:01:59.460 --> 00:01:59.470 
held securely with this kind of call it

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:01.469 
held securely with this kind of call it
system<00:01:59.830> which<00:01:59.979> is<00:02:00.100> really<00:02:00.399> better<00:02:01.119> than<00:02:01.240> the

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:01.479 
system which is really better than the

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:03.419 
system which is really better than the
the<00:02:01.960> other<00:02:02.110> kinds<00:02:02.500> of<00:02:02.560> it<00:02:02.679> is<00:02:02.800> jammed<00:02:03.160> in<00:02:03.310> there

00:02:03.419 --> 00:02:03.429 
the other kinds of it is jammed in there

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:07.919 
the other kinds of it is jammed in there
and<00:02:03.640> so<00:02:04.119> this<00:02:04.300> is<00:02:04.420> also<00:02:04.600> a<00:02:05.289> groove<00:02:06.360> that<00:02:07.360> it's

00:02:07.919 --> 00:02:07.929 
and so this is also a groove that it's

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:09.330 
and so this is also a groove that it's
flat<00:02:08.229> sided<00:02:08.470> and<00:02:08.619> has<00:02:08.709> a<00:02:08.739> groove<00:02:08.979> here<00:02:09.009> so<00:02:09.220> that

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 
flat sided and has a groove here so that

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:12.180 
flat sided and has a groove here so that
it<00:02:09.429> can<00:02:09.610> ride<00:02:09.910> and<00:02:10.290> be<00:02:11.290> held<00:02:11.500> when<00:02:11.769> your<00:02:11.890> pinkie

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 
it can ride and be held when your pinkie

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:13.530 
it can ride and be held when your pinkie
when<00:02:12.310> you're<00:02:12.430> holding<00:02:12.730> this<00:02:12.819> in<00:02:13.030> the<00:02:13.300> tool

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
when you're holding this in the tool

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.470 
when you're holding this in the tool
when<00:02:14.019> you<00:02:14.110> go<00:02:14.230> start<00:02:14.440> stitching

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.260 

so<00:02:18.230> the<00:02:18.470> way<00:02:18.590> you<00:02:18.650> hold<00:02:18.980> these<00:02:19.250> needles<00:02:19.790> is<00:02:20.000> you

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:20.270 
so the way you hold these needles is you

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:23.589 
so the way you hold these needles is you
you<00:02:20.810> take<00:02:20.989> your<00:02:21.200> left<00:02:21.440> hand<00:02:21.560> needle<00:02:21.980> is<00:02:22.940> held

00:02:23.589 --> 00:02:23.599 
you take your left hand needle is held

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:25.210 
you take your left hand needle is held
between<00:02:23.720> your<00:02:24.110> index<00:02:24.890> finger<00:02:25.069> your<00:02:25.190> ring

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
between your index finger your ring

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.400 
between your index finger your ring
finger<00:02:25.610> and<00:02:25.790> the<00:02:26.599> same<00:02:26.810> thing<00:02:27.019> on<00:02:27.110> your<00:02:27.140> right

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
finger and the same thing on your right

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:30.550 
finger and the same thing on your right
hand<00:02:27.560> and<00:02:28.030> your<00:02:29.030> pinkie<00:02:29.390> locks<00:02:29.599> around<00:02:29.810> the

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
hand and your pinkie locks around the

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.860 
hand and your pinkie locks around the
the<00:02:30.950> stitching<00:02:31.250> all<00:02:31.400> and<00:02:31.640> you<00:02:32.030> never<00:02:32.480> want<00:02:32.750> to

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
the stitching all and you never want to

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:34.210 
the stitching all and you never want to
you<00:02:33.230> know<00:02:33.290> drop<00:02:33.590> your<00:02:33.769> stitching<00:02:34.069> awl<00:02:34.190> or

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
you know drop your stitching awl or

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:35.620 
you know drop your stitching awl or
anything<00:02:34.489> and<00:02:34.670> you<00:02:34.730> can<00:02:34.940> use<00:02:35.060> your<00:02:35.180> your

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:35.630 
anything and you can use your your

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:38.080 
anything and you can use your your
fingers<00:02:35.930> to<00:02:36.080> manipulate<00:02:36.590> the<00:02:36.880> needles<00:02:37.880> when

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
fingers to manipulate the needles when

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:40.089 
fingers to manipulate the needles when
you<00:02:38.180> start<00:02:38.390> to<00:02:38.480> work<00:02:38.630> with<00:02:38.660> them<00:02:38.930> so<00:02:39.140> the<00:02:39.769> way

00:02:40.089 --> 00:02:40.099 
you start to work with them so the way

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:42.699 
you start to work with them so the way
you<00:02:40.160> start<00:02:40.430> off<00:02:40.550> is<00:02:40.880> you<00:02:41.599> want<00:02:41.810> since<00:02:42.349> this<00:02:42.530> is

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:42.709 
you start off is you want since this is

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:44.470 
you start off is you want since this is
got<00:02:43.190> facets<00:02:43.730> on<00:02:43.819> it<00:02:43.940> you<00:02:44.030> want<00:02:44.180> to<00:02:44.269> pick<00:02:44.450> a

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
got facets on it you want to pick a

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.449 
got facets on it you want to pick a
facet<00:02:44.989> and<00:02:45.110> normally<00:02:45.590> that<00:02:45.620> I<00:02:45.739> always<00:02:46.280> pick

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:46.459 
facet and normally that I always pick

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:48.369 
facet and normally that I always pick
this<00:02:46.610> the<00:02:46.849> flat<00:02:47.120> side<00:02:47.390> so<00:02:47.810> that<00:02:47.840> it's<00:02:48.170> shaped

00:02:48.369 --> 00:02:48.379 
this the flat side so that it's shaped

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:51.280 
this the flat side so that it's shaped
kind<00:02:49.099> of<00:02:49.190> like<00:02:49.250> that<00:02:49.580> as<00:02:49.880> it's<00:02:50.150> going<00:02:50.450> into<00:02:51.140> the

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
kind of like that as it's going into the

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:52.809 
kind of like that as it's going into the
hole<00:02:51.440> so<00:02:51.620> it<00:02:51.709> goes<00:02:52.160> too<00:02:52.280> straight<00:02:52.549> and<00:02:52.580> then

00:02:52.809 --> 00:02:52.819 
hole so it goes too straight and then

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:53.979 
hole so it goes too straight and then
goes<00:02:52.940> down<00:02:52.970> it<00:02:53.480> makes<00:02:53.630> kind<00:02:53.750> of<00:02:53.870> like<00:02:53.959> a

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:53.989 
goes down it makes kind of like a

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:56.140 
goes down it makes kind of like a
diamond<00:02:54.170> shape<00:02:54.440> and<00:02:54.680> you<00:02:55.579> use<00:02:55.730> your<00:02:55.760> over

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
diamond shape and you use your over

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.030 
diamond shape and you use your over
stick<00:02:56.360> your<00:02:56.540> your<00:02:57.079> wheel<00:02:57.260> stitching<00:02:57.920> wheel

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
stick your your wheel stitching wheel

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:59.740 
stick your your wheel stitching wheel
here<00:02:58.250> to<00:02:58.940> mark<00:02:59.150> where<00:02:59.269> you<00:02:59.329> going<00:02:59.450> to<00:02:59.510> go<00:02:59.599> so

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 
here to mark where you going to go so

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:03.720 
here to mark where you going to go so
here's<00:02:59.930> one<00:03:00.140> mark<00:03:00.590> here<00:03:00.769> and<00:03:01.090> you<00:03:02.090> shove<00:03:02.840> it<00:03:02.959> in

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
here's one mark here and you shove it in

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:06.009 
here's one mark here and you shove it in
between<00:03:04.730> your<00:03:04.849> fingers<00:03:04.970> here<00:03:05.269> and<00:03:05.450> try<00:03:05.810> not<00:03:05.930> to

00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:06.019 
between your fingers here and try not to

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:08.949 
between your fingers here and try not to
stab<00:03:06.200> yourself<00:03:06.319> and<00:03:06.709> then<00:03:07.340> you<00:03:07.430> twist<00:03:07.579> it<00:03:07.959> when

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:08.959 
stab yourself and then you twist it when

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:11.259 
stab yourself and then you twist it when
you<00:03:09.079> pull<00:03:09.260> it<00:03:09.349> back<00:03:09.380> out<00:03:09.849> and<00:03:10.849> then<00:03:11.030> you<00:03:11.120> take

00:03:11.259 --> 00:03:11.269 
you pull it back out and then you take

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:13.000 
you pull it back out and then you take
your<00:03:11.299> other<00:03:11.450> hand<00:03:11.569> and<00:03:11.840> you<00:03:12.500> pull<00:03:12.709> the<00:03:12.799> thread

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 
your other hand and you pull the thread

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:15.420 
your other hand and you pull the thread
through<00:03:13.040> and<00:03:13.579> you<00:03:14.569> feed<00:03:14.810> the<00:03:14.930> other<00:03:14.959> thread

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
through and you feed the other thread

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:51.280 
through and you feed the other thread
back<00:03:16.430> over<00:03:16.730> this<00:03:16.819> hand<00:03:17.079> and<00:03:18.079> then

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:51.290 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:55.190 

so<00:03:52.580> one<00:03:53.580> of<00:03:53.610> the<00:03:53.730> the<00:03:54.390> other<00:03:54.420> one<00:03:54.960> of<00:03:55.050> the<00:03:55.110> other

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 
so one of the the other one of the other

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.290 
so one of the the other one of the other
steps<00:03:55.830> to<00:03:55.890> this<00:03:56.100> technique<00:03:56.460> is<00:03:56.580> that<00:03:56.610> when<00:03:57.180> you

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:57.300 
steps to this technique is that when you

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:59.870 
steps to this technique is that when you
stitch<00:03:57.990> through<00:03:58.260> and<00:03:58.440> you<00:03:58.710> go<00:03:58.920> through<00:03:59.100> a<00:03:59.190> fair

00:03:59.870 --> 00:03:59.880 
stitch through and you go through a fair

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:02.560 
stitch through and you go through a fair
amount<00:04:00.120> of<00:04:00.150> material<00:04:00.240> and<00:04:00.750> it's<00:04:01.410> too<00:04:01.860> thick

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:02.570 
amount of material and it's too thick

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:04.610 
amount of material and it's too thick
when<00:04:03.570> you<00:04:03.690> drive<00:04:03.900> your<00:04:04.050> second<00:04:04.380> needle

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
when you drive your second needle

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:06.590 
when you drive your second needle
through<00:04:04.830> they<00:04:05.190> can<00:04:05.340> get<00:04:05.490> pretty<00:04:06.150> tough<00:04:06.420> and

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:06.600 
through they can get pretty tough and

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:08.180 
through they can get pretty tough and
this<00:04:06.960> thing<00:04:07.140> is<00:04:07.230> waxed<00:04:07.650> and<00:04:07.740> it's<00:04:07.890> hard<00:04:08.040> to<00:04:08.070> get

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:08.190 
this thing is waxed and it's hard to get

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:10.040 
this thing is waxed and it's hard to get
a<00:04:08.220> hold<00:04:08.340> of<00:04:08.490> so<00:04:09.180> one<00:04:09.420> of<00:04:09.450> the<00:04:09.570> techniques<00:04:09.690> is

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:10.050 
a hold of so one of the techniques is

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:12.770 
a hold of so one of the techniques is
that<00:04:10.200> you<00:04:10.590> can<00:04:10.740> grab<00:04:10.890> the<00:04:11.040> needle<00:04:11.220> itself<00:04:11.780> with

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
that you can grab the needle itself with

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:14.240 
that you can grab the needle itself with
a<00:04:12.810> thread<00:04:13.170> that<00:04:13.290> you<00:04:13.410> just<00:04:13.650> pulled<00:04:14.070> through

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250 
a thread that you just pulled through

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:16.789 
a thread that you just pulled through
from<00:04:14.400> the<00:04:14.490> backside<00:04:14.850> to<00:04:15.300> help<00:04:15.480> pull<00:04:15.959> through

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799 
from the backside to help pull through

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:18.680 
from the backside to help pull through
and<00:04:17.070> if<00:04:17.310> that<00:04:17.430> doesn't<00:04:17.640> work<00:04:17.790> you<00:04:18.660> can

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
and if that doesn't work you can

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:20.720 
and if that doesn't work you can
actually<00:04:19.109> wrap<00:04:19.350> the<00:04:19.980> thread<00:04:20.430> around<00:04:20.549> the

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:20.730 
actually wrap the thread around the

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:24.050 
actually wrap the thread around the
needle<00:04:20.790> and<00:04:21.150> back<00:04:21.570> a<00:04:21.600> little<00:04:21.959> bit<00:04:22.169> so<00:04:22.910> it<00:04:23.910> gives

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060 
needle and back a little bit so it gives
