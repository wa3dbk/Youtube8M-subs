00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.060
 hi friends from youtube I hope you are 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:09.240
 well today I'm going to teach 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:11.140
 how to have music on your ipod iphone 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.780
 touch ipad 

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:17.150
 without needing to have the break like this 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:20.140
 Ok, let's start 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:22.490
 as I told you a few seconds ago this 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:25.579
 this video is not necessary to have a 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:27.830
 jailbreak so then let's go to the 

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:31.660
 app store 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:35.840
 we go to the app store and we look for that one 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:37.970
 application is called music box 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:40.250
 and how do they see the icon and how do I see the 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:43.760
 discharge of weight 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:47.040
 it weighs 24 mb and says it requires some 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:50.190
 6.1 later there is no need to warn them 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:52.940
 then we're going to open it 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:57.230
 quickly 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:01:00.199
 and how they see the interface and there are like times 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:04.390
 I've been testing it a bit but it's 

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:04.390
 it would be like an interface 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.900
 as an interface so to speak and here 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:12.960
 in looking for you look for the 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:15.119
 song that they want that yes before 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.690
 continue with the video the only detail is 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:21.120
 that this application always needs a 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:23.220
 Internet connection 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:25.830
 so you keep your music in 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.930
 Favorites in lists in lists of 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.610
 reproduction to be able to reproduce it if 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.850
 you are not in your homes you have to 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:35.190
 have an internet connection then 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.530
 let's keep looking at any 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:40.770
 linkin park 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:43.020
 and we're going to good at the bottom and 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.500
 as you see is the search 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.630
 are the favorites 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:50.030
 to add the music to listen to it 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:53.430
 when they are outside their homes 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:56.530
 here are in players 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:59.770
 and here it is in the options 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:03.580
 and as you see you say reduce the use of 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:06.159
 data says it shows the cover or the 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:08.110
 album cover in the place of the video 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:10.780
 so that the data consumption is reduced 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:12.959
 and here I have the data activated 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:12.959
 mobile 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:20.480
 then we continue in the search we are going to 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:24.800
 play let's play some two 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:26.900
 seconds the indigenous song because 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:31.230
 they know for copyright reasons 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:35.150
 it will be only two seconds we go there 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.150
 and there they go and then 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:41.600
 and how they see there is working 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:44.880

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:48.640
