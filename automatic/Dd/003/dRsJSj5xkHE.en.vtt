00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:05.710
 today I would like to talk about an animal that 

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:08.080
 it's really funny it's called bear 

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:10.870
 lazy surely many will have 

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:14.049
 heard about or have you already seen 

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:16.630
 some video of this animal this animal 

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:18.850
 is the slowest animal in the world there is no 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:21.310
 no animal that moves more slowly 

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:23.910
 nor that he takes life so calmly 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:25.530
 how is it wrong 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.760
 you know how long it takes to do 

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:32.550
 digestion one month it takes to do the 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:35.489
 digestion a month let's say it's your 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:38.730
 stomach is specialized in digesting 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:42.300
 all kinds of leaves even the hard ones and 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:44.940
 their digestions last up to a month alone 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:48.330
 low tree live the trees and only 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:51.000
 go down the tree once a week to 

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:53.730
 defecate and urinate is to say to make your 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.090
 poop and for me he said in words 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.220
 less thin 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:00.110
 however he does it so slowly that 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:02.240
 often he is hunted for his 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:04.879
 main adversaries such as can be 

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:08.120
 for example the puma or some birds 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:10.940
 raptors notwithstanding despite being so 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:13.250
 slow is not as harmless as you 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:16.760
 you think you have some claws 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:18.710
 about this size very sharp 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:21.020
 who use them to hold on to 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:23.869
 trees but you can also use 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.970
 as a defense system nonetheless 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:28.280
 against a cougar 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:32.060
 against a bird maybe yes but against a 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:34.430
 little cougar serves them we are talking 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.980
 that these bears are capable of 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:43.460
 reach a top speed one 

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:45.700
 maximum speed of 0 202 kilometers per 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:45.700
 hour 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:53.140
 a normal person walking goes to 34 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:55.270
 kilometers per hour we are talking about 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:58.560
 that these animals move like a 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:58.560
 thing like that 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:08.770
 and that going at full speed 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:11.200
 let's say a lazy bear that for something 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:15.100
 they've called it that way it's just going to max 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:17.950
 speed which is as I said 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:20.470
 he only goes at that speed when he's in 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:22.810
 Danger your life or when you are in danger 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:25.900
 their offspring but it is usually 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:29.350
 usually move much slower them 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:33.140
 Take a whole day to get off the glass 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:36.920
 a tree we are talking about a species 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:40.069
 very curious because everything all this being 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:42.020
 live is slow or the functioning of 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:44.280
 your body is very slow it takes to do the 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:46.380
 digestion one month 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.940
 and the way to walk the way the 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:51.180
 way to move between the trees 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:52.890
 it's also very slow they live close to the 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:55.800
 trees that must also be said for 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:57.450
 If you did not know, they have claws that 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:00.180
 he has already mentioned above that they are like this 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:02.100
 who use them to stay clinging 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.260
 to the tree that is where they are most 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:07.620
 insurance 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:11.519
 and well, they only shit once a week and 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:14.310
 piss once a week really are 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:16.829
 very strange beings in some cases 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:18.659
 they can be funny even if you can see 

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:22.470
 some video on youtube or anything 

00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:24.720
 I sincerely recommend you some 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:26.610
 they will laugh at others it will seem curious 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:31.640
 but what is clear is that this 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:31.640
 animal is the slowest in the world
