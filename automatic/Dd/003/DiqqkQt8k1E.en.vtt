added<00:01:55.259> to<00:01:55.380> my<00:01:55.530> routine<00:01:55.890> I<00:01:56.869> don't<00:01:57.869> think<00:01:58.049> that

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
added to my routine I don't think that

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.740 
added to my routine I don't think that
you<00:01:58.259> have<00:01:58.439> to<00:01:58.560> add<00:01:58.740> any<00:01:59.069> particular<00:01:59.880> amount<00:02:00.420> of

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
you have to add any particular amount of

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.199 
you have to add any particular amount of
product<00:02:01.709> to<00:02:01.770> your<00:02:02.009> hair<00:02:02.280> I<00:02:02.520> think<00:02:03.000> it's<00:02:03.119> just

00:02:03.199 --> 00:02:03.209 
product to your hair I think it's just

00:02:03.209 --> 00:02:04.819 
product to your hair I think it's just
whatever<00:02:03.630> you're<00:02:03.899> comfortable<00:02:04.200> with<00:02:04.560> your

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
whatever you're comfortable with your

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:08.059 
whatever you're comfortable with your
hair<00:02:05.099> but<00:02:05.969> of<00:02:06.420> course<00:02:07.109> the<00:02:07.289> more<00:02:07.469> oils<00:02:07.829> you<00:02:07.920> add

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
hair but of course the more oils you add

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:09.800 
hair but of course the more oils you add
to<00:02:08.250> you<00:02:08.340> here<00:02:08.580> the<00:02:08.729> heavier<00:02:09.060> it's<00:02:09.269> going<00:02:09.450> to<00:02:09.660> be

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
to you here the heavier it's going to be

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.140 
to you here the heavier it's going to be
like<00:02:10.470> mine<00:02:10.709> is<00:02:10.979> a<00:02:11.009> lot<00:02:11.400> more<00:02:11.579> heavy<00:02:11.849> than<00:02:11.940> I

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
like mine is a lot more heavy than I

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.520 
like mine is a lot more heavy than I

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:31.859 
it's kind of smells like Carol's

00:02:31.859 --> 00:02:34.880 
it's kind of smells like Carol's
daughter's<00:02:32.340> hair<00:02:32.970> milk<00:02:33.209> and<00:02:33.930> this<00:02:34.200> is<00:02:34.379> such<00:02:34.859> a

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890

great smell so that coupled with the
avocado<00:02:37.049> oil<00:02:37.470> is<00:02:37.890> definitely<00:02:38.459> a<00:02:38.489> little<00:02:38.849> heavy

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:39.239
