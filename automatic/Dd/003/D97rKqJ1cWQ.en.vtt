 this is the game news from Friday 6 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.990
 February 2015 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:27.150
 assasins creed pro is coming to PC 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:30.119
 game not over suits you european 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.840
 union and the xbox 360 is the 7 part in it 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.790
 this series 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.380
 I assume that takes place during the 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.090
 seven year war 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.030
 of which they do have characters from the will u 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.890
 that alcerance not four places just before 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.780
 the clarity in so no done can 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.940
 Your port of Assassin's Creed Unity so 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.559
 this game is ten times better anyway 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.910
 all things to release we are also there 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.520
 Rumors that he is also game to the 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.320
 on other platforms comes the playstation 4 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.510
 and only have xbox one version 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.010
 heard nothing at all that i am a 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.020
 Work is in came that we actually knew 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.460
 about types or had announced him 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.140
 just not when 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.539
 and we now know that the date is 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.220
 namely March 10 at this release 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.590
 the about what extra that option added 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.790
 and support for ajax operation 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.500
 devices 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.850
 because it would be useful if you 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.979
 namely with your eyes to the left or to 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.400
 looks right then the camera comes along 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.400
 to turn 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.530
 I'm curious what you think of Reed Broke 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.860

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:24.750

 oh yeah in the is amazingly good 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.619
 news you choose me soft treat 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.600
 has been deactivated for hours from 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.340
 reactivated last week 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.259
 as long as you already have the game 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.210
 played in peer the game so there will be 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.380
 also happy to be silent about this criticism 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.820
 fraud case 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.680
 because they can just play their gamer 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.259
 you could have paid for it 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.060
 send ubisoft that was a long time ago 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.070
 epic game visible selective number 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.360
 people within his community a 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.250
 mysterious milchers 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.770
 neighborhood in this mail is just one 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.840
 view image without text 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.730
 the mails or could eat dust of dark blue 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.830
 app and games.com 

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:00.750
 The picture show character Jack Gramm 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:02.910
 the seeing and the kampai 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.400
 nice only this is not his own 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:08.640
 this seems to me a gamer very much 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:09.899
 will hear the chainsaw Become a few 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.280
 the big question is of course what 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.140
 this image is trying to us 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.030
 tell a new gears or war 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.920
 maybe he could probably 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:19.440
 Perhaps epic games the entire franchise 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.540
 has sold to microsoft microsoft 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.220
 has its own studio looks like 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.260
 studios that have new cue horn 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.630
 development can still be 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.489
 that a new test prep is arriving in 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:30.900
 was a platform series of the 90s and 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:32.190
 with no less than two games 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.870
 these were made by war now 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.209
 sweating is known as trying or one 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.400
 basement a series and club bleszinski that 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:40.590
 can know sparks or hear there was one 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.239
 third game a development that and 2000 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:44.520
 was canceled for lack of 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:46.680
 polo shirt with internet in the game and 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:48.860
 2002 there was another jazz I am one 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:52.470
 game made for the game boy advance 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:55.110
 not watching over , so we have 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:56.430
 a few maybe frame so much too 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:57.870
 asked on your ipad 2 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:00.150

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:02.310

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:04.830

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:08.910
 I swear I have I want George 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:11.220
 rr is yes pull your wallet but because 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:13.680

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:16.940

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:21.269
 which I don't know what it is 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.519
 you can negotiate in this extension 

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:25.650
 you can go to new work locations 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:27.299
 shimmer up his own business and 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:29.730
 can't thin everything in his store 

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:31.920
 a new shopping comes in April 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:34.200
 this expansion package from the full 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:36.239
 version of sims 4 for my boxes or 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.870
 mac is required to do this 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:39.030
 play 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:40.950
 the price is also not yet known exactly 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:42.600
 but i will probably go around 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:45.450
 40 euros 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:47.519
 in short you have to work yourself to become a child 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:50.120
 work then your sims to 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:50.120
