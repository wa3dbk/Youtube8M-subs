I don't really know how it was invented
I've<00:00:12.179> got<00:00:12.300> a<00:00:12.330> sort<00:00:12.570> of<00:00:12.599> theory<00:00:12.840> on<00:00:13.019> this<00:00:13.110> I

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
I've got a sort of theory on this I

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:14.270 
I've got a sort of theory on this I
think<00:00:13.380> I<00:00:13.530> think<00:00:13.710> it's<00:00:13.799> basically<00:00:14.099> been

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
think I think it's basically been

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:15.919 
think I think it's basically been
created<00:00:14.730> to<00:00:14.820> be<00:00:14.910> as<00:00:15.000> opposite<00:00:15.450> to<00:00:15.480> English

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929

created to be as opposite to English
people<00:00:16.470> as<00:00:16.590> possible<00:00:16.740> I<00:00:17.160> think<00:00:17.550> at<00:00:17.850> some<00:00:18.060> stage

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
people as possible I think at some stage

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.599 
people as possible I think at some stage
during<00:00:18.779> history<00:00:19.250> Scottish<00:00:20.250> people<00:00:20.400> got

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
during history Scottish people got

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:21.890 
during history Scottish people got
together<00:00:20.789> and<00:00:20.970> said<00:00:21.150> all<00:00:21.359> right<00:00:21.390> today<00:00:21.779> we're

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
together and said all right today we're

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.920 
together and said all right today we're
going<00:00:22.080> to<00:00:22.140> design<00:00:22.230> the<00:00:22.560> Scot<00:00:22.830> alright<00:00:23.869> now<00:00:24.869> the

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
going to design the Scot alright now the

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.150 
going to design the Scot alright now the
theory<00:00:25.170> on<00:00:25.380> this<00:00:25.500> is<00:00:25.560> we're<00:00:25.830> going<00:00:25.920> to<00:00:26.010> have

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
theory on this is we're going to have

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.040
