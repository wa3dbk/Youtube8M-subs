00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
just a little too too generic I wanted

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:15.960 
just a little too too generic I wanted
to<00:00:15.180> do<00:00:15.330> something

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:15.970 
to do something

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:23.540 
to do something
more<00:00:16.210> interesting

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.580 

and<00:00:23.849> it's<00:00:24.269> the<00:00:24.449> speed<00:00:24.779> training<00:00:25.050> video

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
and it's the speed training video

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.849 
and it's the speed training video
working<00:00:25.919> on<00:00:26.220> taking<00:00:26.699> your<00:00:26.789> speed<00:00:27.119> up<00:00:27.829> to<00:00:28.829> a

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
working on taking your speed up to a

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:34.430 
working on taking your speed up to a
whole<00:00:29.099> other<00:00:30.619> level

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.110 

and<00:00:34.559> the<00:00:34.800> way<00:00:34.920> I've<00:00:35.100> learned<00:00:35.609> how<00:00:35.730> to<00:00:35.760> do<00:00:35.969> that

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
and the way I've learned how to do that

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:42.350 
and the way I've learned how to do that
is<00:00:36.329> just<00:00:36.379> my<00:00:37.379> practicing<00:00:38.100> real<00:00:39.090> fast

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.480 

and<00:00:42.480> practicing<00:00:43.470> that<00:00:43.680> way<00:00:46.370> you're<00:00:47.370> in

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:47.490 
and practicing that way you're in

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:51.500 
and practicing that way you're in
control<00:00:48.380> lines<00:00:49.380> are<00:00:49.590> controlled<00:00:50.360> motions<00:00:51.360> are

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
control lines are controlled motions are

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.660 
control lines are controlled motions are
controls<00:00:52.050> they're<00:00:52.230> not<00:00:52.380> sloppy<00:00:52.710> and<00:00:53.490> you

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
controls they're not sloppy and you

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.680 
controls they're not sloppy and you
practice<00:00:54.360> right<00:00:54.750> in<00:00:54.780> that<00:00:55.910> in<00:00:56.910> that<00:00:56.970> zone<00:00:57.390> of

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
practice right in that in that zone of

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.950 
practice right in that in that zone of
control<00:00:58.590> quick<00:00:59.190> speed

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
control quick speed

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.480 
control quick speed
until<00:01:01.530> treatment

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:06.490 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:09.140 

this<00:01:07.090> helps<00:01:07.420> your

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
this helps your

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.410 
this helps your
it's<00:01:09.540> helped<00:01:09.750> some<00:01:09.960> speed<00:01:10.230> take<00:01:10.500> it<00:01:10.650> up<00:01:10.800> to<00:01:10.980> a

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:11.420 
it's helped some speed take it up to a

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.800 
it's helped some speed take it up to a
couple<00:01:12.420> notches<00:01:13.460> ox<00:01:14.460> increases<00:01:15.060> and<00:01:15.420> you'll

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
couple notches ox increases and you'll

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.360 
couple notches ox increases and you'll
notice<00:01:16.140> that

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:17.370 
notice that

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:19.700 
notice that
the<00:01:17.820> next<00:01:18.090> time<00:01:18.240> you<00:01:18.360> think<00:01:18.630> again<00:01:19.230> a<00:01:19.260> good<00:01:19.500> our

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
the next time you think again a good our

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.260 
the next time you think again a good our
end<00:01:20.100> of<00:01:20.570> training<00:01:21.620> we<00:01:22.620> surprised<00:01:23.100> on<00:01:23.550> how<00:01:23.580> how

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
end of training we surprised on how how

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:25.970 
end of training we surprised on how how
fast<00:01:24.630> you'll<00:01:24.870> get<00:01:25.080> and<00:01:25.260> see<00:01:25.440> like<00:01:25.620> a<00:01:25.650> week's

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:25.980 
fast you'll get and see like a week's

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:31.100 
fast you'll get and see like a week's
time<00:01:26.270> it's<00:01:27.270> pretty<00:01:27.570> a<00:01:27.690> pretty<00:01:28.140> remarkable<00:01:30.110> but

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
time it's pretty a pretty remarkable but

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.320 
time it's pretty a pretty remarkable but
again<00:01:31.410> you<00:01:31.530> gotta<00:01:31.740> practice<00:01:32.460> as<00:01:32.640> fast<00:01:32.940> as<00:01:33.180> you

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:33.330 
again you gotta practice as fast as you

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:35.540 
again you gotta practice as fast as you
can<00:01:33.570> you<00:01:34.560> don't<00:01:34.710> want<00:01:34.860> to<00:01:34.950> get<00:01:35.040> sloppy<00:01:35.310> you

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:35.550 
can you don't want to get sloppy you

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:38.120 
can you don't want to get sloppy you
want<00:01:35.730> to<00:01:35.790> stay<00:01:35.940> control<00:01:36.360> next<00:01:36.690> to<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:37.860> zone

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
want to stay control next to the zone

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:44.660 
want to stay control next to the zone
you<00:01:38.310> want<00:01:38.520> to<00:01:38.580> do

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670
