 I want to ask you a question, what 's Easter? 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.000
 For you, what does it represent? 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:15.660
 means only an easter egg the 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:19.020

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:41.010
 I still know what the meaning is. 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.989

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:49.590
 Even though it's good, it 's something that 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.969
 was made to divert your goal 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.399
 main 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:56.820
 this is the focus of what it really means 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:59.010
 Easter is not 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.780
 money is not even human makes 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.850
 one of the ways to be afraid of death 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.790
 but no I like also 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:08.010

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:12.659
 You who do not know what Easter is? 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:15.650
 just what fun is not the moment 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:17.880

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:20.369

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.030
 earth passed as human being the chicken 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.850
 people preached the gospel and came to 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.350
 bring freedom and salvation because 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:47.100
 freedom we have free will 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:49.259
