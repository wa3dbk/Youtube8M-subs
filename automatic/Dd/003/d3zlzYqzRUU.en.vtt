varieties that we're growing currently
we<00:01:02.930> can<00:01:03.109> tell<00:01:03.320> that<00:01:03.469> the<00:01:03.620> corals<00:01:04.009> are<00:01:04.100> healthy

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:04.519 
we can tell that the corals are healthy

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:06.789 
we can tell that the corals are healthy
and<00:01:04.670> growing<00:01:04.879> because<00:01:05.390> newer<00:01:05.659> polyps<00:01:06.200> form<00:01:06.560> in

00:01:06.789 --> 00:01:06.799 
and growing because newer polyps form in

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:08.740 
and growing because newer polyps form in
between<00:01:07.220> the<00:01:07.369> more<00:01:07.520> mature<00:01:07.729> polyps<00:01:08.270> as<00:01:08.479> seen

between the more mature polyps as seen
here<00:01:09.220> one<00:01:10.220> possible<00:01:10.700> reason<00:01:10.880> the<00:01:11.119> flowerpot

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:11.630 
here one possible reason the flowerpot

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:13.660 
here one possible reason the flowerpot
corals<00:01:11.960> are<00:01:12.049> doing<00:01:12.320> well<00:01:12.530> for<00:01:12.830> us<00:01:13.009> is<00:01:13.250> their

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:13.670 
corals are doing well for us is their

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:15.820 
corals are doing well for us is their
feeding<00:01:13.909> regimen<00:01:14.470> whenever<00:01:15.470> we<00:01:15.710> encounter

delicate species we try to see if it

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.190 
delicate species we try to see if it
responds<00:01:18.770> to<00:01:18.920> food<00:01:19.280> in<00:01:19.580> our<00:01:20.509> experience

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200

corals<00:01:21.799> that<00:01:21.890> accept<00:01:22.310> feeding<00:01:22.880> tend<00:01:23.299> to<00:01:23.450> do

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:23.600 
corals that accept feeding tend to do

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:24.130 
corals that accept feeding tend to do
better

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:24.140 
better

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.260 
better
the<00:01:25.039> problem<00:01:25.549> with<00:01:25.700> Ghana<00:01:25.940> you<00:01:26.090> plural

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270 
the problem with Ghana you plural

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.570 
the problem with Ghana you plural
however<00:01:26.810> is<00:01:27.110> that<00:01:27.740> they're<00:01:27.920> very<00:01:28.190> sensitive

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:28.580 
however is that they're very sensitive

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:31.480 
however is that they're very sensitive
to<00:01:29.000> contact<00:01:29.570> it<00:01:30.140> seems<00:01:30.799> like<00:01:31.039> it's<00:01:31.220> first

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:31.490 
to contact it seems like it's first

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:33.969 
to contact it seems like it's first
impulse<00:01:32.000> is<00:01:32.210> to<00:01:32.479> shrink<00:01:32.960> away<00:01:33.140> from<00:01:33.590> the<00:01:33.710> food

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:33.979 
impulse is to shrink away from the food

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:36.399 
impulse is to shrink away from the food
so<00:01:34.759> it's<00:01:35.000> important<00:01:35.509> to<00:01:35.659> try<00:01:35.899> to<00:01:35.929> introduce

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:36.409 
so it's important to try to introduce

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:38.380 
so it's important to try to introduce
the<00:01:36.560> food<00:01:36.710> slightly<00:01:37.190> off<00:01:37.369> of<00:01:37.700> the<00:01:37.819> coral<00:01:38.090> and

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:38.390 
the food slightly off of the coral and

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:40.450 
the food slightly off of the coral and
then<00:01:38.780> have<00:01:38.960> the<00:01:39.080> current<00:01:39.470> take<00:01:39.830> the<00:01:39.979> food<00:01:40.190> to

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
then have the current take the food to

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:42.639 
then have the current take the food to
the<00:01:40.610> coral<00:01:40.970> rather<00:01:41.810> than<00:01:42.050> forcefully

00:01:42.639 --> 00:01:42.649 
the coral rather than forcefully

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:45.460 
the coral rather than forcefully
directing<00:01:43.130> the<00:01:43.220> food<00:01:43.429> at<00:01:43.640> it<00:01:44.050> the<00:01:45.050> feeding

directing the food at it the feeding

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:47.200 
directing the food at it the feeding
behavior<00:01:45.979> should<00:01:46.310> look<00:01:46.610> like<00:01:46.759> the<00:01:46.880> stalks

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:47.210 
behavior should look like the stalks

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:50.020 
behavior should look like the stalks
start<00:01:47.810> a<00:01:47.899> bobbing<00:01:48.350> motion<00:01:48.770> and<00:01:49.009> then<00:01:49.610> start<00:01:49.940> to
