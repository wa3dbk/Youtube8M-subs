00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:02.940
 ah 

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:17.360
 working on this new smartphone the 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:19.070
 people sent us enough emails 

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:24.160
 asking us which of course 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:24.160
 we do not answer because we do not have time 

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:35.540
 with 616 which is going to be the same as 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.540
 I have always bought 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.810
 and do that because they keep buying their 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.240
 product all of us know that it is a 

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:45.140
 bullshit but there are bands of assholes 

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:47.640
 saying keys and the new one came out in a 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:50.400
 land of some applications pendejas 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.739
 has the same way pendeja answer 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:55.980
 that does not have anything new personally 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.930
 I think that more than anything is the possible 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.059
 social status that this represents 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.980
 they bought a device from the apple and 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.989
 text made the new smartphones 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.520
 they have made stupid and useless though 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.070
 all the applications that have to 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:10.650
 According to to exercise and sugar 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.240
 nobody uses them bastard even I do not 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.160
 I know what the fuck are invented 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.690
 bullshit good design all 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:18.360
 we know the design of our places 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:20.280
 that are fashionable children are safe 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.930
 rich indeed our smartphone is 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.970
 designed for rich children 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.890
 Of course, they are the largest market that 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.990
 we cover without mentioning them when 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.490
 you write the one who repeats the same thing and 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.259
 lorca because we are one of the most 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.330
 big multi-billion dollar companies in the 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.860
 world there is a curious thing in most 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.050
 of our commercials about this 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.020
 product 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:42.260
 in three white blue eyes gentleman 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:44.380
 and this team is good we are here in 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.380
 Mexico 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:54.170
 in Mexico, it would be a bit racist 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:56.810
 made of not selling them iphones in 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.130
 Mexico but I 'm not going to do it in fact and it 's 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.720
 thanks to this we are expanding 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.240
 our horizons are already right now 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:05.569
 is covering the market in chile 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:09.250
 venezuela colombia east fixate wig 

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:09.250
 white oak 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:15.660
 that is the white in fact the product was 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.670
 invented for white people 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.260
 I do not know in fact personally 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:22.350
 I would feel much better knowing that a 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:29.070
 French an Italian is using a 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:31.290
 Mexican product or one of the 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:34.110
 Main functions of the new iPhone 6 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:36.780
 this is the good clearly the most 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:39.180
 important because Caesar on facebook that 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:42.930
 make an account on Instagram take you 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:44.630
 that office take pictures of your dog 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:47.190
 I think they are the most important 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:49.590
 be hit be advanced to 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:51.480
 languages the important people 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:54.480
 which you have ironic since whatsapp is 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:56.190
 a base application derail this almost 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:59.130
 free that wealthy children use 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:00.540
 this thing and the only ironic thing with 10 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:03.580
 and you're supposed to have money to 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:05.860
 buy a pretty expensive iphone 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:08.750
 I like it because this uses a 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:10.790
 third world application has 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:11.990
 I think that it would be more feasible to hire 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:14.600
 a plan and some company of 

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:17.120
 telecommunications in dv 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:20.800
 it's an idea to get into debt and draw plans 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:20.800
 for the new iphone 6 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:26.740
 do not buy the iphone to communicate 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:28.510
 via telephone do not buy the iphone for 

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:31.030
 Take pictures with your family and 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:32.620
 save them for souvenirs they buy from the 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:35.800
 he left for social status that 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:38.020
 represents if the social status buy 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:41.170
 an iphone for people to say 

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:43.600
 you have a cell phone from the manzanita that you 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:45.610
 of social status the rest does not matter what 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:47.830
 what matters is the social status and how 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:50.050
 people give you a look and they look like things 

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:52.270
 that you're not because probably not 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:55.200
 it's pathetic imbecile but we had 

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:55.200
 social status 

00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:03.660
 selling through us in both 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:03.660
 state 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:07.140
 Y
