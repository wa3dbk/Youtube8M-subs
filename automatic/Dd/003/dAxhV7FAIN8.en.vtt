because nothing's worse than having a

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.179 
because nothing's worse than having a
bomb<00:01:02.100> and<00:01:02.640> hairstyle<00:01:03.420> with<00:01:03.930> dry<00:01:04.379> flakes<00:01:04.949> all

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
regular water nothing added just a

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.740 
regular water nothing added just a
little<00:01:11.610> bit<00:01:11.729> not<00:01:11.880> too<00:01:11.909> much<00:01:12.119> because<00:01:12.600> your

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
little bit not too much because your

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.020

butters<00:02:07.329> but<00:02:07.509> I<00:02:07.539> chose<00:02:07.780> this<00:02:07.990> one<00:02:08.050> because<00:02:08.470> it

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 
butters but I chose this one because it

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:10.520 
butters but I chose this one because it
has<00:02:08.709> a<00:02:08.739> lot<00:02:08.950> of<00:02:08.979> essential<00:02:09.520> oils<00:02:09.849> in<00:02:10.030> it<00:02:10.179> and

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
has a lot of essential oils in it and

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.729 
has a lot of essential oils in it and
beeswax<00:02:11.530> which<00:02:11.890> is<00:02:12.220> what<00:02:12.640> is<00:02:12.849> going<00:02:13.209> to

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:13.739 
beeswax which is what is going to

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:17.220 
beeswax which is what is going to
essentially<00:02:14.739> hold<00:02:15.069> the<00:02:15.640> twist<00:02:16.000> in<00:02:16.390> place<00:02:16.989> or

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
essentially hold the twist in place or

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.559 
essentially hold the twist in place or
hold<00:02:17.440> the<00:02:17.560> definition<00:02:18.190> of<00:02:18.400> the<00:02:18.640> twist<00:02:19.090> out<00:02:19.269> in

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:19.569 
hold the definition of the twist out in

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:24.259 
hold the definition of the twist out in
place<00:02:19.930> so<00:02:20.769> now<00:02:21.519> you<00:02:22.000> can<00:02:22.150> see<00:02:22.420> that<00:02:22.690> my<00:02:22.989> hair<00:02:23.319> is

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:24.269

when they're doing that and you're just

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.140 
when they're doing that and you're just
repeating<00:03:17.769> now<00:03:18.100> when<00:03:18.250> you<00:03:18.340> get<00:03:18.459> to<00:03:18.549> the<00:03:18.640> ends

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150

between<00:03:22.660> your<00:03:23.019> fingers<00:03:23.410> and<00:03:23.650> that's<00:03:23.769> pretty

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:24.489 
between your fingers and that's pretty

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:27.500 
between your fingers and that's pretty
much<00:03:24.639> how<00:03:24.880> you<00:03:24.989> lock<00:03:25.989> in

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
much how you lock in

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:29.660 
much how you lock in
if<00:03:27.900> your<00:03:28.170> twist<00:03:28.470> won't<00:03:28.800> stay<00:03:29.069> in<00:03:29.220> like<00:03:29.430> mine

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
if your twist won't stay in like mine

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
you can use bobby pins or flexi rods to

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:37.610 
you can use bobby pins or flexi rods to
kind<00:03:34.560> of<00:03:34.739> keep<00:03:35.400> the<00:03:35.610> integrity<00:03:36.269> of<00:03:36.300> the<00:03:37.110> ends

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
kind of keep the integrity of the ends

00:04:42.759 --> 00:04:42.769 

00:04:42.769 --> 00:04:46.029 

now<00:04:43.369> I'm<00:04:43.549> just<00:04:43.789> clipping<00:04:44.029> my<00:04:44.330> hair<00:04:44.659> up<00:04:45.469> and

starting from the back and the twist

00:04:48.559 --> 00:04:50.799 
starting from the back and the twist

should be really easy to pull apart

00:04:50.809 --> 00:04:53.709 
should be really easy to pull apart
that's<00:04:51.739> why<00:04:51.979> we<00:04:52.279> you<00:04:52.699> know<00:04:52.819> don't<00:04:53.119> borrow<00:04:53.389> from

00:04:53.709 --> 00:04:53.719 
that's why we you know don't borrow from

00:04:53.719 --> 00:04:55.839 
that's why we you know don't borrow from
each<00:04:54.169> side<00:04:54.619> and<00:04:54.649> everything<00:04:55.309> like<00:04:55.429> that<00:04:55.669> you

00:04:55.839 --> 00:04:55.849 
each side and everything like that you

00:04:55.849 --> 00:04:57.219 
each side and everything like that you
know<00:04:55.969> you<00:04:56.029> want<00:04:56.269> to<00:04:56.360> try<00:04:56.509> to<00:04:56.569> keep<00:04:56.809> the<00:04:57.019> two

00:04:57.219 --> 00:04:57.229 
know you want to try to keep the two

00:04:57.229 --> 00:04:59.439 
know you want to try to keep the two
strands<00:04:57.619> separated<00:04:58.429> as<00:04:58.579> much<00:04:58.759> as<00:04:58.909> possible<00:04:59.089> so

00:04:59.439 --> 00:04:59.449 
strands separated as much as possible so

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:16.540 
strands separated as much as possible so
that<00:04:59.599> you<00:04:59.719> take<00:05:00.019> down<00:05:01.539> easy<00:05:15.279> so<00:05:16.279> I've<00:05:16.399> done

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:16.550 
that you take down easy so I've done

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:20.919 
that you take down easy so I've done
this<00:05:16.759> all<00:05:17.619> throughout<00:05:18.619> my<00:05:19.099> hair<00:05:19.419> it<00:05:20.419> has<00:05:20.629> a<00:05:20.659> lot

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:20.929 
this all throughout my hair it has a lot

00:05:20.929 --> 00:05:22.659 
this all throughout my hair it has a lot
of<00:05:21.019> balance<00:05:21.259> and<00:05:21.559> movement<00:05:22.009> as<00:05:22.129> you<00:05:22.279> can<00:05:22.429> see

00:05:22.659 --> 00:05:22.669 
of balance and movement as you can see

00:05:22.669 --> 00:05:24.399 
of balance and movement as you can see
and<00:05:22.969> now<00:05:23.149> because<00:05:23.719> my<00:05:23.929> hair<00:05:24.139> is<00:05:24.259> a<00:05:24.289> little

00:05:24.399 --> 00:05:24.409 
and now because my hair is a little

00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:26.589 
and now because my hair is a little
disheveled<00:05:24.709> I'm<00:05:25.550> gonna<00:05:25.729> take<00:05:25.969> this<00:05:26.119> duckbill

00:05:26.589 --> 00:05:26.599 
disheveled I'm gonna take this duckbill

00:05:26.599 --> 00:05:29.169 
disheveled I'm gonna take this duckbill
clips<00:05:26.899> and<00:05:27.169> I'm<00:05:27.289> going<00:05:27.559> to<00:05:27.619> basically<00:05:28.519> pin<00:05:29.029> my

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:29.179 
clips and I'm going to basically pin my

00:05:29.179 --> 00:05:32.549 
clips and I'm going to basically pin my
hair<00:05:29.360> down<00:05:29.629> so<00:05:30.019> that<00:05:30.169> it<00:05:30.289> can<00:05:30.469> relax<00:05:31.159> over<00:05:31.849> time

00:05:32.549 --> 00:05:32.559 
hair down so that it can relax over time

00:05:32.559 --> 00:05:35.439 
hair down so that it can relax over time
in<00:05:33.559> a<00:05:33.739> downward<00:05:34.159> motion<00:05:34.189> so<00:05:34.969> that's<00:05:35.149> just<00:05:35.329> not

00:05:35.439 --> 00:05:35.449 
in a downward motion so that's just not

00:05:35.449 --> 00:05:39.609 
in a downward motion so that's just not
as<00:05:36.199> wild<00:05:36.619> since<00:05:36.979> I<00:05:37.069> had<00:05:37.279> it<00:05:37.309> up<00:05:37.550> so<00:05:38.419> as<00:05:38.989> you<00:05:39.529> can

00:05:39.609 --> 00:05:39.619 
as wild since I had it up so as you can

00:05:39.619 --> 00:05:42.009 
as wild since I had it up so as you can
see<00:05:39.679> I've<00:05:40.009> kind<00:05:40.189> of<00:05:40.309> moved<00:05:40.549> the<00:05:41.059> clips<00:05:41.749> a

00:05:42.009 --> 00:05:42.019 
see I've kind of moved the clips a

00:05:42.019 --> 00:05:44.739 
see I've kind of moved the clips a
little<00:05:42.259> bit<00:05:42.379> further<00:05:42.679> down<00:05:43.360> after<00:05:44.360> about<00:05:44.479> five

00:05:44.739 --> 00:05:44.749 
little bit further down after about five

00:05:44.749 --> 00:05:46.629 
little bit further down after about five
minutes<00:05:44.779> I<00:05:45.199> just<00:05:45.229> moved<00:05:45.619> them<00:05:45.800> back<00:05:45.829> down<00:05:46.279> so

00:05:46.629 --> 00:05:46.639 
minutes I just moved them back down so

00:05:46.639 --> 00:05:48.579 
minutes I just moved them back down so
that<00:05:46.819> I<00:05:46.849> can<00:05:47.029> get<00:05:47.179> more<00:05:47.449> length<00:05:47.989> out<00:05:48.199> of<00:05:48.289> my

00:05:48.579 --> 00:05:48.589 
that I can get more length out of my

00:05:48.589 --> 00:05:51.309 
that I can get more length out of my
hair<00:05:48.860> you<00:05:49.429> can<00:05:49.669> position<00:05:50.389> the<00:05:50.629> clips<00:05:50.869> whatever

00:05:51.309 --> 00:05:51.319 
hair you can position the clips whatever

00:05:51.319 --> 00:05:54.850 
hair you can position the clips whatever
you<00:05:51.619> want<00:05:52.119> but<00:05:53.119> I<00:05:53.509> find<00:05:53.989> the<00:05:54.199> lower<00:05:54.469> that<00:05:54.679> you

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:54.860 
you want but I find the lower that you

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:57.129 
you want but I find the lower that you
put<00:05:55.039> them<00:05:55.300> the<00:05:56.300> more<00:05:56.569> length<00:05:56.809> that<00:05:57.019> you

00:05:57.129 --> 00:05:57.139 
put them the more length that you

00:05:57.139 --> 00:06:01.209 
put them the more length that you
probably<00:05:57.379> get<00:05:57.919> and<00:05:58.389> that's<00:05:59.389> it<00:06:00.009> there<00:06:01.009> you<00:06:01.039> go
