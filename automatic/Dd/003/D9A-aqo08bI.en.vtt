00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
 poopcia and TytanowyJanusz92. 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
 So AZP on tour. 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
 I apologize for the worse image quality than usual. 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
 When I processed the video material, I gave the body. 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
 I will not write: poopci, it would sound very bad. 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
 Eh, see the brown riffraff and not be able to withdraw it :-( 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
 Our Heroes ride the T-25, the German premium V tieru. 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
 The gun has AP 116/110, APCR 167/110. 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
 The Wiki says it has a plain MM. 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
 Those 116 on VII tier are not enough. 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
 Ooooh! Well. One less farrier. 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
 Farciarz, or a combination of two words. 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
 The first one is from English :-P. 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
 No, it's not about "far" but close. 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
 In the sense that not the opposite is far away ... 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
 Geeeesus, but my tongue (fingers?) Is confusing ... 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
 The end of insinuations, because I'm going to go. 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
 It's about fart. 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
 And it does not mean "fuksa". 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
 Poopcia has binos. 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
 As usual, they provide invaluable services. 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
 But this BDR shines proximity. 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000
 A lonely Matilda at the base can not make it. 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000
 She did not give. Twice. 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
 And in Polish, and after literal translation into English. 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.000
 Deadly Tomatoes cleaned the base, but ... 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000
 ... all ordinary tomatoes have already fallen. 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.000
 So they settled on the verve and admire the views (on the base). 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000
 OJC! Sam on five ?! 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000
 Poopcia must really fasten up the streaks now. 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.000
 Yeah. I cut out a bit, and what? 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.000
 He did not throw himself at them, he just waited. 

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.000
 Okay, now he was throwing himself, but he turned back to the sound of the siren. 

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.000
 Not only in Greek myths, mermaids are attracting heroes. 

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000
