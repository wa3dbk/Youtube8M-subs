00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
is not the matter that North Korea

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.680 
is not the matter that North Korea
really<00:02:08.970> has<00:02:09.209> to<00:02:09.450> do<00:02:10.160> what<00:02:11.160> it<00:02:11.250> has<00:02:11.280> to<00:02:11.610> do<00:02:11.760> to

in its own way more opposition North

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.670 
in its own way more opposition North
Korea<00:02:17.970> in<00:02:18.150> many<00:02:18.330> ways<00:02:18.540> simply<00:02:18.990> gives<00:02:19.140> it<00:02:19.320> more

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
Korea in many ways simply gives it more

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.710 
Korea in many ways simply gives it more
leverage<00:02:20.010> and<00:02:20.100> more<00:02:20.310> publicity<00:02:20.820> right<00:02:21.330> so<00:02:21.630> the

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
leverage and more publicity right so the

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.090

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
more people get worked up about I can't

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:24.380 
more people get worked up about I can't
believe<00:02:23.340> that<00:02:23.520> North<00:02:23.700> Korea<00:02:23.880> is<00:02:23.940> going<00:02:24.090> to<00:02:24.210> do

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
believe that North Korea is going to do

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.630 
believe that North Korea is going to do
this<00:02:24.600> the<00:02:25.170> more<00:02:25.380> North<00:02:25.590> Korean<00:02:25.890> knows<00:02:26.070> that

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
this the more North Korean knows that

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.070 
this the more North Korean knows that
people<00:02:26.850> are<00:02:27.120> watching<00:02:27.330> what<00:02:27.690> do<00:02:27.780> you<00:02:27.870> think

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
people are watching what do you think

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.710 
people are watching what do you think
more<00:02:28.740> inclusion<00:02:29.250> of<00:02:29.580> North<00:02:29.940> Korean<00:02:30.270> works<00:02:30.480> I

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
more inclusion of North Korean works I

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.090 
more inclusion of North Korean works I
guess<00:02:30.870> acceptance<00:02:31.440> of<00:02:31.590> it<00:02:31.710> in<00:02:31.770> the<00:02:31.830> future

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
guess acceptance of it in the future

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.220 
guess acceptance of it in the future
would<00:02:32.250> that<00:02:32.490> help<00:02:32.840> ensure<00:02:33.840> peace<00:02:34.200> and

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
would that help ensure peace and

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.530 
would that help ensure peace and
stability<00:02:34.440> in<00:02:34.800> that<00:02:34.830> region<00:02:34.920> it<00:02:35.330> might<00:02:36.330> but

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
stability in that region it might but

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:37.940 
stability in that region it might but
see<00:02:36.690> the<00:02:36.780> problem<00:02:36.870> is<00:02:37.140> is<00:02:37.260> North<00:02:37.530> Korea<00:02:37.710> always

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
see the problem is is North Korea always

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:39.290 
see the problem is is North Korea always
wants<00:02:38.160> the<00:02:38.220> acceptance<00:02:38.700> only<00:02:38.970> on<00:02:39.030> its<00:02:39.180> own

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
wants the acceptance only on its own

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.000 
wants the acceptance only on its own
terms<00:02:39.630> I<00:02:40.020> mean<00:02:40.320> this<00:02:40.380> is<00:02:40.500> this<00:02:40.620> goes<00:02:40.770> back<00:02:40.980> to

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
terms I mean this is this goes back to

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.160 
terms I mean this is this goes back to
the<00:02:41.310> sunshine<00:02:41.700> policy<00:02:41.910> period<00:02:42.330> under<00:02:42.990> Kim

dae-jung in South Korea in which the

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:45.990 
idea was to kind of unconditionally

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:48.830 
idea was to kind of unconditionally
accept<00:02:46.170> and<00:02:46.890> embrace<00:02:46.950> North<00:02:47.430> Korea<00:02:47.730> and<00:02:48.090> over

accept and embrace North Korea and over

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.120 
accept and embrace North Korea and over

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:52.100 
time people looking very disenchanted
about<00:02:50.670> that<00:02:50.880> because<00:02:51.240> North<00:02:51.570> Korea<00:02:51.630> seemed<00:02:52.050> to

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
about that because North Korea seemed to

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:57.860 
about that because North Korea seemed to
just<00:02:52.260> take<00:02:52.380> advantage<00:02:52.410> of<00:02:52.980> it<00:02:56.360> do<00:02:57.360> you<00:02:57.450> see<00:02:57.720> at

just take advantage of it do you see at

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.990 
just take advantage of it do you see at
all<00:02:58.050> a<00:02:58.380> possibility<00:02:59.040> of<00:02:59.130> a<00:02:59.220> peaceful<00:02:59.700> solution

to this
sure<00:03:01.590> I<00:03:01.620> mean<00:03:01.860> that<00:03:02.040> there<00:03:02.160> are<00:03:02.220> a<00:03:02.280> number<00:03:02.430> of

and there are a number of ways that
North<00:03:06.630> Korea<00:03:06.900> would<00:03:07.530> probably<00:03:07.860> respond

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
North Korea would probably respond

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:09.500 
North Korea would probably respond
