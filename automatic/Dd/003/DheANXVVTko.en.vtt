00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:05.580
 ah 

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:12.540
 ah 

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:21.420
 hello cooks today we are going to prepare your 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:24.119
 Raw sauerkraut is a typical dish of 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:27.410
 Central Europe that is served as 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:30.660
 accompaniment of knuckle sausages or 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:32.349
 this kind of meat consisting of 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:36.760
 pork 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:40.180
 the original crude is cabbage fermented with 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:42.879
 Salt and spices are left to ferment and that 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:44.079
 is what we then consume as the 

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:45.940
 chubut 

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:47.609
 we will prepare us 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:51.220
 it really is not a preparation of 

00:00:47.609 --> 00:00:53.470
 fermented but it's going to be cooked 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:56.680
 the reason is that the ferment what 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:01:00.340
 really requires special vessels 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:02.200
 and a long preparation time is 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:05.500
 much more comfortable and simpler the 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:07.280
 do it cooking but you'll see that 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:10.610
 Really 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:12.650
 it's easy to do and the result is going to 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:15.350
 be very similar to what can be a 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:18.250
 fermented sauerkraut 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:23.200
 ingredients that we will use will be 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:26.800
 cabbage or apple cabbage 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:28.450
 olive oil vinegar 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.080
 to sugar 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:32.940
 Salt 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:35.720
 white wine or wine to slide 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:38.290
 ground pepper 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:40.640
 a little butter 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:43.510
 to aniseed powder 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.510
 and nail 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:50.359
 We will take a portion of the cabbage 

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:53.840
 200 grams approximately and 

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:55.260
 we will start by taking away your heart or 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.320
 trunk 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:01.170
 because it's too hard 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:04.260
 and we will also remove the most 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:06.150
 external ones that are too hard 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:09.590
 next we will use the mandolin 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:09.590
 to go cutting 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:21.060
 and we have the cabbage ready to cook 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:23.110
 then we will take an apple 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.300
 about half an apple for the 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:28.630
 how much cabbage we're 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:32.640
 using and we will fight and the 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:32.640
 We will also cut in July 

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:49.270
 and now we have the ingredients 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:51.250
 ready to start cooking 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:53.810
 we will put the fire to heat to fire 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:57.340
 medium 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:59.610
 and we are going to put 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:03.980
 the butter 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:03.980
 so that it melts 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:11.140
 once the butter we see that 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:13.319
 starts 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:15.610
 To boil 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:18.660
 we will put 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:18.660
 the Apple 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:24.970
 to sauté the 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.480
 and 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:39.280
 yes 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:47.550
 then we will add the cabbage 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:10.790
 and we will mix it all 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:23.130
 we will add the white wine 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:29.440
 we will add the vinegar 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:36.900
 we will put half a tablespoon of 

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:36.900
 sugar 

00:04:40.569 --> 00:04:44.429
 a quarter of a tablespoon of salt 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:52.650
 a pinch of anise the grain 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:00.660
 a couple of nails 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:06.220
 and finally a little black pepper 

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:06.220
 milled 

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:15.520
 we will remove everything well 

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:23.150
 and we'll let him know 

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:25.940
 first on high heat 

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:27.860
 until it breaks to boil and starts to see 

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:29.960
 sea ​​a little 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:32.330
 once it starts to boil what 

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:35.780
 let it simmer covered 

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:41.539
 about 15 minutes to cook well 

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:42.710
 the cabbage and the apple and then what 

00:05:41.539 --> 00:05:45.860
 we will uncover and we will have it 

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:48.020
 approximately 2 hours at very low heat 

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:52.810
 to finish consuming all the 

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:52.810
 liquid and we only have the cabbage 

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:59.800
 once past this time we already see that 

00:05:57.130 --> 00:06:04.110
 The color has completely changed 

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:07.020
 the cabbage is quite cooked 

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:09.870
 and now we will have a very slow fire 

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:12.450
 for a couple of hours and uncovered for 

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:14.700
 that all is completely consumed 

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:16.950
 liquid once all the 

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:19.380
 we will remove it from the fire and 

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:21.900
 we can reserve it to use it 

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:25.380
 when we want in the fridge we can 

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:27.960
 endure several months this would be a 

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:29.900
 Typical example for using sauerkraut 

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:34.009
 as a garnish 

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:39.759
 with a sausage a little mustard the 

00:06:34.009 --> 00:06:39.759
 sauerkraut and a sweet havre gherkin
