00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:05.520
 behaved mature and efficient this is the 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:09.140
 better definition for the new voyage 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.140
 2014 model 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.049
 exhibiting the new look of the German brand in 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.510
 front and new taillights 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.189
 It looked like cousin j 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.199
 point for the appearance since it is 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:25.010
 most expensive and breaking car face 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.010
 current 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:32.009
 this version also won some bingos 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:33.780
 interesting as the eco- comfort that gives 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.239
 important notices to the driver in the 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.070
 panel to alert you to close the 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.010
 when the air conditioner is 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.379
 connected the interior but remained the same 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.600
 but nothing that depreciates the finish to 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.219
 quality of materials and bolts 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.500
 still very good 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.420
 is with respect to internal space and 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.149
 especially in the rear seat 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.219
 only two adults and 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:59.340
 a child in the middle and not to mention that 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:01.680
 in this place has a headrest but 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.820
 missing the three-point belt 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:07.229
 to understand at least the trunk with 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:09.270
 480 liters capacity 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.760
 it is reasonable for a car with pretensions 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.580
 in mechanics there is also no 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.920
 news in this version the engine is 1.6 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.830
 total flex that once again proved to be 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.299
 the most suitable for this body 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:25.110
 delivering enough torque at lows 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:26.880
 rotation allows quick responses and 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.280
 with which the voyage is very legal of 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.400
 driving mainly in the city without 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.930
 speak in the camp easy and precise continues 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.390
 being a reference between the cars 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.880
 if national stability if the goiÃ¡s 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:42.659
 comes out well and with safe behavior in the 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:46.079
 consumption a small skid the 6.2 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:48.540
 kilometers per liter of ethanol and 8.8 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:51.360
 gasoline emits on average that we 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.610
 in our testing circuit are few 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.040
 to the present day organs in English 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.240
 last night the world has only three 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.880
 Team points 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.520
 because neither worse without great news in the 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.110
 goiÃ¡s of 2014 counts on the tradition 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.540
 quality standards to be imposed on the 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:09.509
 but here among us with several competitors 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:12.270
 like big fiat and nissan versa by 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:15.930
 example cheaper than even 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:19.700
 the bigger the inside his life is 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.700
 getting harder and harder
