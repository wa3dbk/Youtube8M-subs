00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:06.750
 and welcome people to one more 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.429
 Video channel 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.710
 in today's video we will see a little 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:13.139
 about the history of your 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.540
 up to market condition 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.900
 I hope you like the video and we're going 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.900
 over there 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:39.690
 nvidia corporation founded in 1993 by 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:41.910
 three co-founders luÃ­s melo kells that the 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.890
 yen and gee sung yong 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:47.730
 the first project made by nvidia was 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:50.190
 the ssg thomson chipset in 1995 more 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.260
 known as he sees one was about 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.180
 a 2D and 3d graphics processor with 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.520
 Built-in 32-channel sound memory 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.390
 with support for games bids compatible with 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.550
 sega saturn 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.859
 but the level presented a problem 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.110
 despite offering 3D graphic performance 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.640
 reasonable to use 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.979
 was far from being 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.659
 popular at the time being different from 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.409
 polygon pattern of three 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.869
 sides 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.610
 the audio processing was medium with 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.220
 evaluations pointing to a quality 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.020
 only acceptable for this project 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.820
 has a very high cost of 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.009
 because it contains many resources 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.939
 so nvidia discontinued the 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.479
 project 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:30.060
 later in 1999 mg launched geforce and 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:33.240
 v10 that has the new features of 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:35.250
 3d graphics utilizing lighting 120 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.770
 mhz frequency product made very successful 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.390
 in a short time microsoft synthesized the 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.250
 nvidia projects and has closed a contract 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.869
 millionaire to manufacture his new 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.640
 xbox in mid 2000 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.350
 it is worth remembering that in 2004 nvidia 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.840
 began to develop the project of the new 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.090
 playstation 3 graphics chip that will be 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.130
 released only 2006, the curious thing is that this 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.810
 innovative powerful atom processor that 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.729
 was used massively by the Air Force 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.479
 united states to ride a super 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.310
 computer 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:01.860
 In those years, NVIDIA came 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.259
 technologies such as 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.420
 sl technology that enables connection 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:08.310
 up to four video cards of the same 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.229
 chip working together depending on 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.970
 the model so you can increase the 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.620
 performance in its 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:14.480
 3d work games without spending too much 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:16.220
 money with a stronger board 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.260
 the content of the technology 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.060
 scheduling unfortunately we still have 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.920
 many games that do not use very well 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:25.780
 this resource doing what I know is if it 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.780
 does not perform as it should have 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:35.110
 we also have the technology of 5 is about 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:37.989
 of integrated technology and monitors 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:39.459
 what makes a careless games disappear like 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:41.319
 monitor work on a frequency 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:43.269
 different from video cards there is a 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:45.580
 civilization of the image leaving the 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:47.890
 quality of the cheerleading problem 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:50.140
 that could only be fixed with the v5 that 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:52.209
 limited the frame rate in the gpu to 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:53.769
 stay in line with the monitor but thanks 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:55.480
 to this jesse technology where this does not 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:57.400
 is more necessary because the quality of 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.590
 image you see in games is maintained 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.450
 since the gpu and a monitor are operating 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:03.489
 at similar rates within another 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:05.500
 nvidia technology has a focus on 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:07.269
 nvidia child is a console 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:09.640
 laptop with android operating system 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:11.470
 able to perform streaming games 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:13.870
 pc without any problems 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:16.989
 The notebook has the Tegra 4 chip . 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:21.040
 1.9 ghz 2 gb of ram 5 inch screen 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:22.959
 resolution 1280 by 720 pixels but with 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.940
 certainty in the gaming world technology 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:26.890
 most famous of nvidia or physics 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:28.569
 is a proprietary plate technology 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:31.150
 Video here also has resources 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:32.859
 physics in games that support it and the 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:34.780
 instead of being sued by the 

00:03:32.859 --> 00:03:36.310
 processor is processed by the adapter 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.090
 video using hide behind which 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:39.220
 for this 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:41.410
 so the processor that less cag the game 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:43.750
 it looks much more beautiful and like nvidia 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:45.579
 is currently on the market well 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:46.959
 currently leads the pilot market 

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:49.060
 with his maxwell line 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:51.519
 are very strong plates of low consumption 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:54.310
 in several technologies, highlighting the 

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:56.049
 gtx 970 because it is considered one of the 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:58.060
 better value for money cards 

00:03:56.049 --> 00:03:59.650
 history of the company having 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:02.769
 almost equal to that of his former queen of 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:04.299
 breaks the gtx 781 in this new generation 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:05.980
 We have to be here for two years. 

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:10.870
 monsters that deal with the 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:12.910
 gtx 983 gt xytex to gtx 980 i have got 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:15.069
 less specifications than tec tex 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:17.200
 but it's a flagship car of the plates of force 

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:19.660
 titan window is a blend between plates 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:22.000
 block and geforce board and by having 12 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:24.520
 gb ram the board holds up very well in 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.199
 tests at high resolutions and for being max 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:28.120
 gets cox very high in overclocking 

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:30.280
 even though it is a plate with fairing of 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:32.220
 reference to nvidia also has the 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:34.240
 they are used processors 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:36.340
 imported and smartphones 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:39.099
 the most advanced tegra chip today 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:40.729
 to south techcrunch has 256 cores 

00:04:39.099 --> 00:04:42.169
 course you can take before 

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:44.569
 the chip also has an architecture 

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:46.370
 max and has 20 nanometers and is worth 

00:04:44.569 --> 00:04:48.169
 remember that in addition to their geforce boards 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:50.389
 nvidia also has the tesla line 

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:52.400
 made for workstation and frame line 

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:53.749
 will return to 3d computing in addition to 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:56.389
 be present graphics processors 

00:04:53.749 --> 00:04:57.800
 mobile phones to the technologies of 

00:04:56.389 --> 00:05:01.309
 nvidia are also present in 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:03.050
 car servers and workstations the 

00:05:01.309 --> 00:05:04.309
 people are staying here I hope 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:05.900
 that you liked 

00:05:04.309 --> 00:05:08.330
 I tried to summarize the most 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:10.669
 important is nvidia in this technology 

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:12.080
 the main ones as it is in the market 

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:14.330
 currently 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:16.999
 If you liked, share the video or 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:19.689
 then she in fanpage's it is up 

00:05:16.999 --> 00:05:19.689
 more
