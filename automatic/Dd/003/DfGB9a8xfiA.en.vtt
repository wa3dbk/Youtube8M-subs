00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
gloved hands but it will still work and

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.030 
gloved hands but it will still work and
still<00:02:55.739> serve<00:02:55.980> its<00:02:56.129> purpose<00:02:56.489> very<00:02:56.669> well<00:02:58.040> the

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
still serve its purpose very well the

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:04.039 
still serve its purpose very well the
liners<00:02:59.489> like<00:03:00.030> I<00:03:00.150> said<00:03:00.590> fully<00:03:02.000> run<00:03:03.000> run<00:03:03.780> fully

00:03:04.039 --> 00:03:04.049 
liners like I said fully run run fully

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:05.659 
liners like I said fully run run fully
through<00:03:04.319> the<00:03:04.409> handle<00:03:04.769> they're<00:03:05.400> not

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:05.669 
through the handle they're not

00:03:05.669 --> 00:03:07.729 
through the handle they're not
skeletonized<00:03:06.450> so<00:03:07.049> it<00:03:07.109> gives<00:03:07.260> us<00:03:07.349> some<00:03:07.530> extra

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:07.739 
skeletonized so it gives us some extra

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:11.420 
skeletonized so it gives us some extra
rigidity<00:03:08.750> does<00:03:09.750> have<00:03:09.930> a<00:03:09.989> liner<00:03:10.200> lock<00:03:10.439> but

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
rigidity does have a liner lock but

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.520 
rigidity does have a liner lock but
what's<00:03:11.579> really<00:03:11.730> cool<00:03:11.879> about<00:03:12.060> this<00:03:12.359> knife<00:03:12.629> same

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
what's really cool about this knife same

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:16.610 
what's really cool about this knife same
on<00:03:13.680> the<00:03:13.799> other<00:03:13.829> m16<00:03:14.700> models<00:03:15.120> and<00:03:15.409> on<00:03:16.409> the

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
on the other m16 models and on the

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.969 
on the other m16 models and on the
Pocket<00:03:17.040> version<00:03:18.139> the<00:03:19.139> pocket<00:03:19.470> carry<00:03:19.590> version

00:03:19.969 --> 00:03:19.979 
Pocket version the pocket carry version

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:24.759 
Pocket version the pocket carry version
of<00:03:20.069> the<00:03:20.129> m16<00:03:20.400> is<00:03:21.349> a<00:03:22.489> the<00:03:23.489> liner<00:03:23.790> lock<00:03:24.180> itself

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:24.769 
of the m16 is a the liner lock itself

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:28.460 
of the m16 is a the liner lock itself
this<00:03:25.769> is<00:03:25.829> a<00:03:25.979> separate<00:03:26.609> lock<00:03:26.870> that<00:03:27.870> locks<00:03:28.260> the

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
this is a separate lock that locks the

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.530 
this is a separate lock that locks the
liner<00:03:28.709> so<00:03:28.859> you<00:03:29.040> cannot<00:03:29.370> disengage<00:03:29.909> the<00:03:30.329> lock

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
liner so you cannot disengage the lock

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:33.860 
liner so you cannot disengage the lock
itself<00:03:30.959> from<00:03:31.169> the<00:03:31.290> knife<00:03:31.879> so<00:03:32.879> what<00:03:33.780> you

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
itself from the knife so what you

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:36.379 
itself from the knife so what you
basically<00:03:34.049> do<00:03:34.500> is<00:03:34.699> disengages<00:03:35.699> lock<00:03:35.729> up<00:03:36.120> here

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:36.389 
basically do is disengages lock up here

00:03:36.389 --> 00:03:39.469 
basically do is disengages lock up here
that<00:03:37.319> frees<00:03:37.709> the<00:03:38.310> liner<00:03:38.519> lock<00:03:38.760> and<00:03:39.120> you're

00:03:39.469 --> 00:03:39.479
