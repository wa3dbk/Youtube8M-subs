00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:10.519
 good we are going to present the Chinese crane 

00:00:04.129 --> 00:00:10.519
 first has been designed by us 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:16.400
 no part of the back there is almost 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.400
 all 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:23.060
 we have a nothing 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:38.780
 rudimentary I hope it works well 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:41.329
 as you can see in this way the 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:43.100
 painters work a little more 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:45.339
 comfortable since the weight of the 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.339
 hives 

00:00:51.339 --> 00:01:01.839
 with a 12 volt motor that goes 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:05.530
 installed in this we will do that is a 

00:01:01.839 --> 00:01:05.530
 Remote control 

00:01:05.969 --> 00:01:10.140
 what brings him to Carlos in his hand 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:19.060
 followed by let's see and there you have it 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:22.180
 it's very simple it's very simple and I was 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:27.939
 connected to the car with which we avoid 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:31.259
 having to have to dispose of 

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:31.259
 obligation of a group d 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:37.110
 and the light and there we have the plug of the 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:37.110
 Rúa 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:44.470
 and by means of unplug we stop the 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:47.740
 electricity directly to the poly pasture 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:51.800
 that is installed in the middle with water 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:54.380
 measures 4 meters of the night tapatía 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:56.270
 and as you can see in this case we have 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.530
 brought only the traces because still 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:03.390
 we still have to prepare 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:09.420
 let's say the ballet seats for 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:11.550
 to put to catch the hives by which 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.980
 it's true two by two or four in 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:18.930
 four since the pointed crane can 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:21.270
 load 150 kilos and in the center that 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.700
 you can also work with two controls 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:27.030
 can load 300 and peak kilos is 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:31.190
 ready for a good video 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:31.190
 without more a greeting from Uncle Carlos 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:38.569
 and you see here where we are 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:38.569
 in the middle of natural landscape 

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:49.250
 and now we are going to teach you how to take 

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:52.660
 in the box come goes to carlitos exact 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:52.660
 I have already taken the box 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.860
 and it 's just with one hand he handles it 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:58.860
 directly 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:06.079
 its what I thought
