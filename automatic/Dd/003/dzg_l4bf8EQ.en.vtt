I'm just gonna put that all over the top
as<00:05:41.420> well<00:05:41.450> in<00:05:42.020> fact<00:05:42.050> I<00:05:42.350> think<00:05:42.560> it's<00:05:42.830> easier<00:05:43.250> if

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:43.880 
as well in fact I think it's easier if

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:45.610 
as well in fact I think it's easier if
you<00:05:44.090> just<00:05:44.270> dump<00:05:44.570> it<00:05:44.750> like<00:05:44.900> this<00:05:45.140> and<00:05:45.470> then<00:05:45.590> just

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:45.620 
you just dump it like this and then just

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:49.480 
you just dump it like this and then just
kind<00:05:45.830> of<00:05:46.160> push<00:05:46.850> it<00:05:46.880> around<00:05:48.130> looks<00:05:49.130> like<00:05:49.280> that

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:49.490 
kind of push it around looks like that

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:51.160 
kind of push it around looks like that
we're<00:05:49.670> gonna<00:05:49.820> pop<00:05:50.000> it<00:05:50.030> in<00:05:50.180> the<00:05:50.330> oven<00:05:50.570> 350

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:51.170 
we're gonna pop it in the oven 350

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:55.510 
we're gonna pop it in the oven 350
degrees<00:05:51.490> for<00:05:52.490> about<00:05:52.870> 30<00:05:53.870> minutes<00:05:54.370> there's<00:05:55.370> all

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:55.520 
degrees for about 30 minutes there's all

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:57.670 
degrees for about 30 minutes there's all
the<00:05:55.640> layers<00:05:55.940> so<00:05:56.180> you<00:05:56.480> can<00:05:56.660> see<00:05:57.020> everything<00:05:57.560> all

00:05:57.670 --> 00:05:57.680 
the layers so you can see everything all

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:58.600 
the layers so you can see everything all
together

00:05:58.600 --> 00:05:58.610 
together

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:00.520 
together
YUM<00:05:59.390> I<00:05:59.630> can't<00:05:59.810> wait<00:05:59.960> to<00:06:00.050> see<00:06:00.169> what<00:06:00.290> it<00:06:00.380> looks

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:00.530 
YUM I can't wait to see what it looks

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:03.310 
YUM I can't wait to see what it looks
like<00:06:00.650> when<00:06:00.800> it<00:06:00.919> comes<00:06:01.010> out<00:06:01.840> okay<00:06:02.840> so<00:06:02.900> I<00:06:03.260> just

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:03.320 
like when it comes out okay so I just

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:06.460 
like when it comes out okay so I just
pulled<00:06:03.830> the<00:06:03.980> lasagna<00:06:04.490> out<00:06:04.669> of<00:06:04.760> the<00:06:05.000> oven<00:06:05.180> so<00:06:05.690> it

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:06.470 
pulled the lasagna out of the oven so it

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:09.070 
pulled the lasagna out of the oven so it
looks<00:06:06.710> like<00:06:06.830> still<00:06:07.280> bubbling<00:06:07.880> and<00:06:08.360> it<00:06:08.840> was<00:06:08.930> in

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:09.080 
looks like still bubbling and it was in

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:11.110 
looks like still bubbling and it was in
there<00:06:09.230> about<00:06:09.500> 30<00:06:09.800> minutes<00:06:10.370> there's<00:06:10.730> all<00:06:10.940> the

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:11.120 
there about 30 minutes there's all the

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:13.330 
there about 30 minutes there's all the
layers<00:06:11.390> I'm<00:06:12.020> gonna<00:06:12.200> let<00:06:12.290> it<00:06:12.380> sit<00:06:12.710> up<00:06:12.830> for<00:06:13.100> just

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:13.340 
layers I'm gonna let it sit up for just

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:19.810 
layers I'm gonna let it sit up for just
a<00:06:13.490> little<00:06:13.640> bit<00:06:13.790> before<00:06:14.150> I<00:06:14.300> slice<00:06:14.630> into<00:06:14.900> it<00:06:18.820> all

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:19.820 
a little bit before I slice into it all

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:20.370 
a little bit before I slice into it all
right

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:20.380 
right

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:22.980
