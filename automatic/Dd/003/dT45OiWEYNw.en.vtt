00:00:04.879 --> 00:00:09.230 

well<00:00:05.879> I<00:00:06.120> got<00:00:06.390> a<00:00:06.420> coil<00:00:06.720> again<00:00:07.670> heading<00:00:08.670> from

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
well I got a coil again heading from

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.490 
well I got a coil again heading from
Hamilton<00:00:09.750> Ontario<00:00:09.840> to<00:00:10.440> tell<00:00:10.889> it<00:00:11.040> dick<00:00:11.300> Alabama

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:12.500 
Hamilton Ontario to tell it dick Alabama

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.160 
Hamilton Ontario to tell it dick Alabama
single-coil<00:00:13.500> it's<00:00:13.740> only<00:00:13.889> 18,000<00:00:14.670> pounds<00:00:15.139> so<00:00:16.139> I

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
single-coil it's only 18,000 pounds so I

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.170 
single-coil it's only 18,000 pounds so I
used<00:00:17.180> three<00:00:18.180> chains<00:00:19.430> which<00:00:20.430> is<00:00:20.580> basically<00:00:20.970> an

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
used three chains which is basically an

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.410 
used three chains which is basically an
overkill<00:00:21.630> already<00:00:22.020> because<00:00:22.650> these<00:00:23.519> are<00:00:23.820> you

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
overkill already because these are you

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.509 
overkill already because these are you
know<00:00:24.710> 3/8<00:00:25.760> jeans<00:00:26.760> right<00:00:26.970> but<00:00:27.980> my<00:00:28.980> spools<00:00:29.369> are

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
know 3/8 jeans right but my spools are

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.020 
know 3/8 jeans right but my spools are
only<00:00:29.670> rated<00:00:29.910> for<00:00:30.090> 5500<00:00:30.990> pounds<00:00:31.140> right<00:00:32.030> it's

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
only rated for 5500 pounds right it's

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.470 
only rated for 5500 pounds right it's
always<00:00:33.270> a<00:00:33.390> good<00:00:33.570> idea<00:00:33.630> to<00:00:33.930> check<00:00:35.120> each<00:00:36.120> trailer

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
always a good idea to check each trailer

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.810 
always a good idea to check each trailer
should<00:00:36.750> have<00:00:37.129> something<00:00:38.129> like<00:00:38.250> this<00:00:38.489> like<00:00:38.700> I

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
should have something like this like I

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.760 
should have something like this like I
was<00:00:38.969> saying<00:00:39.210> in<00:00:39.300> my<00:00:39.329> previous<00:00:40.170> videos<00:00:40.500> you<00:00:40.530> see

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
was saying in my previous videos you see

was saying in my previous videos you see
like<00:00:40.920> my<00:00:41.100> strongest<00:00:41.610> one<00:00:41.850> in<00:00:42.570> rail<00:00:42.899> chain

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
like my strongest one in rail chain

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.900 
like my strongest one in rail chain
dying<00:00:43.739> down<00:00:43.920> 60<00:00:44.579> 100<00:00:45.200> so<00:00:46.200> that's<00:00:46.670> one<00:00:47.670> of<00:00:47.820> these

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
dying down 60 100 so that's one of these

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.139 
dying down 60 100 so that's one of these
babies<00:00:48.149> right<00:00:49.070> yes<00:00:50.070> unfortunately<00:00:50.250> it<00:00:50.969> was

too too close it was too close to the

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.680 
too too close it was too close to the
coil<00:00:55.199> like<00:00:56.160> I<00:00:56.280> tried<00:00:56.550> to<00:00:56.670> hook<00:00:56.789> it<00:00:56.940> up<00:00:57.059> here<00:00:57.329> and

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
coil like I tried to hook it up here and

I'm gonna spend money on this and then
of<00:01:56.330> course<00:01:56.390> you<00:01:56.660> have<00:01:56.810> to<00:01:56.960> use<00:01:57.010> edge

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:58.010 
of course you have to use edge

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:59.770 
of course you have to use edge
perspective<00:01:58.640> I<00:01:58.790> learned<00:01:59.060> is<00:01:59.360> that<00:01:59.420> very

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
perspective I learned is that very

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.920 
perspective I learned is that very
important<00:02:00.290> is<00:02:00.560> when<00:02:01.160> they<00:02:01.310> load<00:02:01.550> this<00:02:01.930> like

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:02.930 
important is when they load this like

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:05.410 
important is when they load this like
these<00:02:03.170> things<00:02:03.440> can<00:02:03.680> twist<00:02:04.010> so<00:02:04.880> what<00:02:05.030> I<00:02:05.060> did<00:02:05.150> I

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
these things can twist so what I did I

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.560 
these things can twist so what I did I
got<00:02:05.870> a<00:02:06.080> hammer<00:02:06.410> and<00:02:06.800> actually<00:02:07.580> I<00:02:07.610> tried<00:02:07.760> to<00:02:08.179> you

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:08.570 
got a hammer and actually I tried to you

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:11.800 
got a hammer and actually I tried to you
know<00:02:08.600> hammer<00:02:09.500> this<00:02:09.770> part<00:02:10.100> make<00:02:10.399> it<00:02:10.810> create

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
know hammer this part make it create

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:13.420 
know hammer this part make it create
like<00:02:11.960> an<00:02:12.110> angle<00:02:12.380> here<00:02:12.620> because<00:02:13.100> when<00:02:13.280> it's

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
like an angle here because when it's

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:15.460 
like an angle here because when it's
really<00:02:13.910> ninety<00:02:14.270> degrees<00:02:14.630> the<00:02:14.870> coil<00:02:15.140> doesn't

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
really ninety degrees the coil doesn't

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:17.290 
really ninety degrees the coil doesn't
like<00:02:15.620> that<00:02:15.830> and<00:02:16.010> then<00:02:16.190> the<00:02:16.340> wood<00:02:16.520> starts<00:02:16.910> going

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
like that and then the wood starts going

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.360 
like that and then the wood starts going
sideways<00:02:18.260> you<00:02:18.560> see<00:02:18.709> like<00:02:18.860> here<00:02:19.070> it's<00:02:19.190> that

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
sideways you see like here it's that

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:23.230 
sideways you see like here it's that
it's<00:02:19.700> it<00:02:20.030> started<00:02:20.360> flipping<00:02:20.750> up<00:02:20.900> and<00:02:21.740> I<00:02:22.430> asked

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:23.240 
it's it started flipping up and I asked

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:24.820 
it's it started flipping up and I asked
the<00:02:23.330> crane<00:02:23.570> guy<00:02:23.810> to<00:02:23.870> lift<00:02:24.260> it<00:02:24.410> a<00:02:24.470> couple<00:02:24.650> of

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
the crane guy to lift it a couple of

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:28.380

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:21.170 
all different so like my previous coil

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:23.860 
all different so like my previous coil
was<00:03:21.350> much<00:03:21.590> more<00:03:22.430> narrow<00:03:22.820> this<00:03:23.300> one<00:03:23.540> is<00:03:23.660> like

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
was much more narrow this one is like

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:27.730 
was much more narrow this one is like
breaking<00:03:24.440> as<00:03:24.740> wide<00:03:25.550> as<00:03:25.700> the<00:03:25.730> trailer<00:03:26.620> so<00:03:27.620> now

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:27.740 
breaking as wide as the trailer so now

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:30.850 
breaking as wide as the trailer so now
the<00:03:27.800> fun<00:03:28.100> begins<00:03:28.900> see<00:03:29.900> that<00:03:30.080> black<00:03:30.350> actively

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:32.240 
thing on the asphalt there on the

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:35.470 
thing on the asphalt there on the
concrete<00:03:32.830> that's<00:03:33.830> my<00:03:34.250> top<00:03:34.580> but<00:03:35.030> thankfully

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:35.480 
concrete that's my top but thankfully

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:39.580 
concrete that's my top but thankfully
it's<00:03:35.570> only<00:03:35.630> 16<00:03:36.260> by<00:03:36.410> 16<00:03:36.910> so<00:03:37.910> it's<00:03:38.300> only<00:03:38.510> 15<00:03:39.230> kilos

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:39.590 
it's only 16 by 16 so it's only 15 kilos

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:43.120 
it's only 16 by 16 so it's only 15 kilos
or<00:03:39.920> thirty<00:03:40.310> pounds<00:03:41.260> doesn't<00:03:42.260> look<00:03:42.560> perfect

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.130 
or thirty pounds doesn't look perfect

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:44.860 
or thirty pounds doesn't look perfect
but<00:03:43.459> I<00:03:43.520> think<00:03:43.700> it's<00:03:44.060> Turkey<00:03:44.330> this<00:03:44.600> time<00:03:44.840> I

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:44.870 
but I think it's Turkey this time I

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:46.990 
but I think it's Turkey this time I
tried<00:03:45.020> to<00:03:45.200> use<00:03:45.380> something<00:03:45.680> new<00:03:45.980> something<00:03:46.790> I

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:47.000 
tried to use something new something I

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.410 
tried to use something new something I
saw<00:03:47.300> on<00:03:47.810> how<00:03:48.530> the<00:03:48.590> guys<00:03:48.890> trucks<00:03:49.420> normally

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:50.420 
saw on how the guys trucks normally

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:52.449 
saw on how the guys trucks normally
would<00:03:50.570> never<00:03:50.750> leave<00:03:51.380> the<00:03:51.560> front<00:03:51.770> open<00:03:52.250> like

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:52.459 
would never leave the front open like

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:57.340 
would never leave the front open like
this<00:03:53.350> but<00:03:54.350> I<00:03:54.680> saw<00:03:55.100> on<00:03:55.370> many<00:03:55.550> trucks<00:03:55.910> that<00:03:56.350> he

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:57.350 
this but I saw on many trucks that he

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:59.890 
this but I saw on many trucks that he
was<00:03:57.500> staying<00:03:57.769> in<00:03:57.920> place<00:03:58.209> because<00:03:59.209> it's<00:03:59.480> so<00:03:59.630> low

00:03:59.890 --> 00:03:59.900 
was staying in place because it's so low

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:01.690 
was staying in place because it's so low
profile<00:04:00.470> so<00:04:00.709> the<00:04:00.860> wind<00:04:01.070> actually<00:04:01.250> keeps

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:01.700 
profile so the wind actually keeps

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:06.809 
profile so the wind actually keeps
hanging<00:04:02.120> down<00:04:02.920> a<00:04:03.920> couple<00:04:04.610> of<00:04:04.730> hours<00:04:04.970> later

00:04:06.809 --> 00:04:06.819 
hanging down a couple of hours later

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:10.430 
hanging down a couple of hours later
and<00:04:06.939> the<00:04:07.180> miracle<00:04:07.390> I<00:04:07.719> was<00:04:08.290> hoping<00:04:08.709> for

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.440 
and the miracle I was hoping for

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:15.559 
and the miracle I was hoping for
did<00:04:10.620> not<00:04:10.740> happen

00:04:15.559 --> 00:04:15.569 

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:18.800 

was<00:04:15.870> bubbling<00:04:16.320> up<00:04:16.530> he's<00:04:16.769> amazing
