but<00:01:06.510> to<00:01:06.930> really<00:01:07.110> be<00:01:07.350> on<00:01:07.380> that<00:01:07.560> next<00:01:07.770> level<00:01:08.010> to

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
but to really be on that next level to

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.670

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.740 
+ deadlift there's no way around it but
something<00:01:16.920> I<00:01:17.040> certainly<00:01:17.460> want<00:01:17.759> assume<00:01:18.479> that

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
something I certainly want assume that

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.840 
something I certainly want assume that
I'm<00:01:19.020> certainly<00:01:19.409> looking<00:01:19.710> to<00:01:20.130> move<00:01:20.310> towards

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850

but you obviously I just haven't done
enough<00:01:22.979> for<00:01:23.220> my<00:01:23.340> training<00:01:23.700> to<00:01:23.759> get<00:01:23.909> there<00:01:24.119> so

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
enough for my training to get there so

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.330 
enough for my training to get there so
you<00:01:25.080> know<00:01:25.140> going<00:01:25.380> forward<00:01:25.680> you<00:01:25.799> can<00:01:25.890> see<00:01:26.040> a<00:01:26.070> lot

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340
