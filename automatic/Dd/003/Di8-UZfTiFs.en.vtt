things up a bit and go for Corsairs

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:17.440 
things up a bit and go for Corsairs
probably<00:05:16.280> all<00:05:16.430> right<00:05:16.610> hand<00:05:16.790> spotting<00:05:17.180> that<00:05:17.210> so

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:17.450 
probably all right hand spotting that so

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:19.450 
probably all right hand spotting that so
that's<00:05:17.630> pretty<00:05:17.900> on<00:05:18.080> on<00:05:18.740> target<00:05:19.190> with<00:05:19.220> this

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:19.460 
that's pretty on on target with this

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:22.000 
that's pretty on on target with this
spotting<00:05:20.390> this<00:05:20.540> time<00:05:20.750> i<00:05:21.200> expect<00:05:21.710> him<00:05:21.830> play<00:05:21.980> a

spotting this time i expect him play a

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:23.820 
spotting this time i expect him play a
little<00:05:22.160> bit<00:05:22.310> safer<00:05:22.550> probably<00:05:23.510> getting<00:05:23.690> some

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:23.830 
little bit safer probably getting some

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:27.760 
little bit safer probably getting some

genome strategy that if if that is what

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:36.040 
genome strategy that if if that is what

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:38.210 
mind but j dongs you got to think about

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:39.280 
mind but j dongs you got to think about
the<00:05:38.330> strategy<00:05:38.570> he<00:05:38.630> had<00:05:38.750> a<00:05:38.780> last<00:05:38.930> night<00:05:39.140> is

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:39.290 
the strategy he had a last night is

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:40.480 
the strategy he had a last night is

controlling speed it you got to think

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:44.170 
controlling speed it you got to think
about<00:05:42.500> what<00:05:42.650> he<00:05:42.710> went<00:05:42.860> for<00:05:43.070> went<00:05:43.700> from<00:05:43.820> udaas

the goon and he did that and once he saw
that<00:06:05.150> was<00:06:05.390> coming<00:06:05.690> and<00:06:05.840> because<00:06:06.320> he<00:06:06.350> knew<00:06:06.590> that

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:06.620 
that was coming and because he knew that

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:08.740 
that was coming and because he knew that
all<00:06:07.100> that<00:06:07.490> situation<00:06:08.210> was<00:06:08.300> going<00:06:08.510> on<00:06:08.600> him

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:08.750 
all that situation was going on him

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:10.540 
all that situation was going on him
swinging<00:06:08.930> that<00:06:09.080> too<00:06:09.320> much<00:06:09.440> there<00:06:09.680> but<00:06:09.710> because

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:10.550 
swinging that too much there but because

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:11.920 
swinging that too much there but because
of<00:06:10.580> the<00:06:10.700> damage<00:06:10.850> he<00:06:11.060> did<00:06:11.090> he<00:06:11.390> also<00:06:11.540> knew<00:06:11.900> that

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:11.930 
of the damage he did he also knew that

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:14.350 
of the damage he did he also knew that
the<00:06:12.410> observatory<00:06:13.130> would<00:06:13.280> be<00:06:13.400> heavily<00:06:13.940> delayed

the<00:06:18.860> observatory<00:06:19.610> is<00:06:19.670> gonna<00:06:19.790> be<00:06:19.880> very<00:06:19.910> heavily

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:20.390 
the observatory is gonna be very heavily

the observatory is gonna be very heavily
delayed<00:06:20.660> so<00:06:20.810> we<00:06:20.900> just<00:06:21.020> went<00:06:21.140> for<00:06:21.320> a<00:06:21.350> few

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:21.470 
delayed so we just went for a few

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:23.800 
delayed so we just went for a few
workers<00:06:21.770> to<00:06:21.920> defend<00:06:22.280> to<00:06:23.120> kind<00:06:23.390> of<00:06:23.450> get<00:06:23.660> some

games okies didn't even eat what for
I've<00:06:33.030> got<00:06:33.330> the<00:06:33.560> no<00:06:34.560> crack<00:06:34.800> upgrade<00:06:35.160> for<00:06:35.370> his

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:35.520 
I've got the no crack upgrade for his

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:37.159 
I've got the no crack upgrade for his

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:51.790 
attack speed upgrade and just alongside
a<00:06:48.300> few<00:06:48.449> workers<00:06:48.750> one<00:06:48.960> and<00:06:49.110> what<00:06:49.440> we<00:06:49.530> dominated

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:51.800 
a few workers one and what we dominated

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:54.140 
a few workers one and what we dominated
so<00:06:52.800> I'm<00:06:52.979> wondering<00:06:53.100> what<00:06:53.430> are<00:06:53.580> there<00:06:53.789> yeah

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:54.150 
so I'm wondering what are there yeah

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:56.350 
so I'm wondering what are there yeah
probably<00:06:54.389> with<00:06:54.990> that<00:06:55.199> aggressive<00:06:55.560> strategy

00:06:56.350 --> 00:06:56.360 
probably with that aggressive strategy

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:58.520 
probably with that aggressive strategy
muta<00:06:57.360> strategy<00:06:57.780> is<00:06:57.840> going<00:06:57.960> to<00:06:58.020> force<00:06:58.259> that<00:06:58.380> to

00:06:58.520 --> 00:06:58.530 
muta strategy is going to force that to

00:06:58.530 --> 00:06:59.450 
muta strategy is going to force that to
play<00:06:58.740> probably<00:06:59.070> a<00:06:59.100> little<00:06:59.190> bit<00:06:59.340> more

00:06:59.450 --> 00:06:59.460 
play probably a little bit more

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:02.150 
play probably a little bit more

going to be a can in there those so yeah
it's<00:07:27.060> already<00:07:27.330> a<00:07:27.570> couple<00:07:27.750> of<00:07:27.900> candidates<00:07:28.229> that

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:28.590 
it's already a couple of candidates that
