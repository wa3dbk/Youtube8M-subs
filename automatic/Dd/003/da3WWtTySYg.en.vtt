then the I've got a pretty this is this
is<00:01:03.930> a<00:01:03.989> new<00:01:04.110> addition<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:05.220> Wu<00:01:05.400> audio<00:01:05.790> wa7

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
is a new addition the the Wu audio wa7

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.580 
is a new addition the the Wu audio wa7
Firefly's<00:01:07.500> so<00:01:08.250> it's<00:01:08.490> a<00:01:08.670> it's<00:01:09.060> a<00:01:09.240> DAC<00:01:09.780> so<00:01:10.470> it's

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
Firefly's so it's a it's a DAC so it's

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.560 
Firefly's so it's a it's a DAC so it's
got<00:01:10.770> kind<00:01:10.950> of<00:01:11.040> like<00:01:11.100> the<00:01:11.310> best<00:01:11.549> of<00:01:11.790> the<00:01:11.909> future

got kind of like the best of the future

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:13.940 
got kind of like the best of the future
and<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:12.840> best<00:01:13.140> of<00:01:13.229> the<00:01:13.290> pass<00:01:13.500> cuz<00:01:13.770> there's<00:01:13.920> a

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
and the best of the pass cuz there's a

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.340 
and the best of the pass cuz there's a
tube<00:01:14.310> amplifier<00:01:14.880> pre<00:01:15.630> amplifier<00:01:15.840> section

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
tube amplifier pre amplifier section

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.280 
tube amplifier pre amplifier section
with<00:01:16.770> this<00:01:16.950> really<00:01:17.369> nice<00:01:17.610> DAC<00:01:18.150> and<00:01:18.600> then<00:01:18.780> my

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
with this really nice DAC and then my

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.980 
with this really nice DAC and then my
most<00:01:19.590> recent<00:01:20.009> upgrade<00:01:20.880> was<00:01:21.270> just<00:01:21.630> this<00:01:21.780> whole

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
most recent upgrade was just this whole

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.590 
most recent upgrade was just this whole
tower<00:01:22.460> this<00:01:23.460> has<00:01:23.670> kind<00:01:24.150> of<00:01:24.270> got<00:01:24.420> some

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
tower this has kind of got some

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.359 
tower this has kind of got some
nostalgia<00:01:25.229> value

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
nostalgia value

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.120 
nostalgia value
it's<00:01:26.610> an<00:01:26.759> old<00:01:26.970> HP<00:01:27.540> power<00:01:28.140> called<00:01:28.500> a<00:01:28.619> blackbird

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
it's an old HP power called a blackbird

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.760 
it's an old HP power called a blackbird
and<00:01:29.520> that<00:01:29.939> they<00:01:30.090> made<00:01:30.299> like<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:30.780> mid<00:01:30.990> 2000s

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
and that they made like the mid 2000s

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.219 
and that they made like the mid 2000s
it's<00:01:32.100> got<00:01:32.490> a<00:01:32.850> bunch<00:01:33.270> of<00:01:33.509> course<00:01:34.049> they're

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
it's got a bunch of course they're

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.499 
it's got a bunch of course they're
upgrades<00:01:34.590> so<00:01:34.799> I<00:01:34.829> kind<00:01:35.070> of<00:01:35.159> modernized<00:01:36.060> it<00:01:36.299> with

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
upgrades so I kind of modernized it with

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.020 
upgrades so I kind of modernized it with
ddr4<00:01:37.290> I've<00:01:37.829> basically<00:01:38.310> redid<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:38.909> whole

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
ddr4 I've basically redid the whole

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.060 
ddr4 I've basically redid the whole
water<00:01:39.329> cooling<00:01:39.720> system<00:01:40.049> with<00:01:40.259> an<00:01:40.380> H<00:01:40.530> 100<00:01:40.979> I

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
water cooling system with an H 100 I

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.120 
water cooling system with an H 100 I
it's<00:01:41.640> got<00:01:41.850> an<00:01:42.060> X<00:01:42.299> 15<00:01:42.689> our<00:01:42.780> die<00:01:42.930> our<00:01:43.560> supply<00:01:43.890> so

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
it's got an X 15 our die our supply so

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.069 
it's got an X 15 our die our supply so
it<00:01:44.610> doesn't<00:01:44.970> even<00:01:45.060> come<00:01:45.270> on<00:01:45.299> this<00:01:45.689> monitor

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
it doesn't even come on this monitor

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:50.240 
it doesn't even come on this monitor
here<00:01:46.619> it's<00:01:46.920> 34<00:01:47.520> 40<00:01:47.939> by<00:01:48.079> 1440<00:01:49.079> so<00:01:49.680> it's<00:01:49.950> sort<00:01:50.189> of

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
here it's 34 40 by 1440 so it's sort of

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.460 
here it's 34 40 by 1440 so it's sort of
in<00:01:50.579> in-between<00:01:51.270> 4k<00:01:51.780> and

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
in in-between 4k and

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.440 
in in-between 4k and
but<00:01:53.250> it<00:01:53.430> really<00:01:53.730> kind<00:01:53.910> of<00:01:53.940> enables<00:01:54.300> you<00:01:54.420> to

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
but it really kind of enables you to

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.480 
but it really kind of enables you to
have<00:01:54.780> a<00:01:55.080> really<00:01:55.440> immersive<00:01:56.070> gaming

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
have a really immersive gaming

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.520 
have a really immersive gaming
experience<00:01:57.150> I've<00:01:57.420> got<00:01:57.630> the<00:01:57.780> the<00:01:58.050> k70<00:01:58.500> RGB

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
experience I've got the the k70 RGB

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.220 
experience I've got the the k70 RGB
keyboard<00:01:59.220> which<00:01:59.400> I<00:01:59.520> love<00:02:00.060> actually<00:02:00.540> just<00:02:01.080> went

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:01.230 
keyboard which I love actually just went

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:03.380 
keyboard which I love actually just went
to<00:02:01.410> mechanical<00:02:01.950> so<00:02:02.160> kind<00:02:02.730> of<00:02:02.850> kind<00:02:03.210> of<00:02:03.240> took

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
to mechanical so kind of kind of took

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.120 
to mechanical so kind of kind of took
the<00:02:03.540> big<00:02:03.690> leap<00:02:03.720> and<00:02:04.140> the<00:02:04.350> Sabre<00:02:04.560> Mouse<00:02:04.800> which

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
the big leap and the Sabre Mouse which

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.130
