 he says he gets a fatal error this is 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:18.640
 because there are some bookstores and the truth 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.240
 I do not really know how to solve it 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.470
 but 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:25.600

 download the pure minecraft that all 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:32.710
 we have to go to the limit of 

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:34.530
 description that will lead you to this 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:36.510
 make up tour page 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.990

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:38.990

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:50.600

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:53.450
 says to be rust thrower and say to and from 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:56.960
 you should go well charter launcher to the neighbor 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:58.759

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.710
 we drag it to the desk and here 

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:04.150
 I have we can change the name what 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:04.150
 that we want and we open it 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:14.150
 then in the trade the screen or the 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.610
 profile of the launcher before this one 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.700
 it's so different but it's updated 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.680
 now 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:22.120
 I do not know I think you showed them 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:25.380
 first really this 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:27.690
 to present with what they do their 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:30.950
 how do you want to call if you have a 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.950
 ladder to appear 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:38.810
 here as always are the profiles 

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:42.439
 and here to see this is what is going to be called 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:44.329
 practically the same the same 

00:02:42.439 --> 00:02:48.010
 same lion things close earlier 

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:48.010
 the assigned arrivals 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:53.230
 here so that they see that there is no 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:54.910
 error that's like the last launcher that 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:57.610
 launched minecraft the ashmolean that is 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:03:01.770
 the same but it is created 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:01.770

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:25.700
 by the act so that great success 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:34.210
 the part that I camelas kim in an idol 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:37.380
 and I have everything that is tetris 

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:37.380
 how can you see the errors 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:42.850
 better than the sound of having tripled 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.850
 all right 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:47.250
 a good see 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:52.370
