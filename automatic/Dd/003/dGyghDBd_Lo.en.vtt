00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:06.470
 how the stop and butt initiative was born on the beach 

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:10.610
 well the initiative is born from the cooked video and you always find yourself 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:16.079
 every year you find yourself on a beach you are alas eh punctually 

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:17.230
 here I'm 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:22.429
 own export perra giulia I have to say unfortunately it costs me 

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:23.880
 % 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.150
 for the incivility the people unfortunately this truth 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:31.419
 for a malpractice uses the object of the cigarette 

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:35.699
 for the beach then our indignation our polere well to 

00:00:35.699 --> 00:00:40.960
 our life takes us by force, and throws a message that it wants 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:46.230
 be an obviously positive perre message trying to unite anyway 

00:00:46.229 --> 00:00:49.240
 our land would fly in this case I do not know the beach 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.320
 launch a small message of civilization for which it is possible 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:59.520
 simply having as tools or having a minimum of 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:00.800
 self-respect 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.550
 time must be maintained 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.750
 if the clean beach is like that to have a place for the bad to hate all 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:07.640
 file so 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.900
 I'm not civil that's why this initiative is born 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.900
 but the choice is your own in a way or yes 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.740
 few boys instead it is enough to talk just to complain we do 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:25.350
 something ourselves putting our will in there is a weir there 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:31.159
 simply arming us good will by trying to make everyone aware 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:35.380
 those who are beach vendors towards a problem yourself anyway 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:36.350
 exists 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:40.140
 and I like to point out to you that we don't place ourselves in contradiction with 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:45.130
 no one is there ourselves that we put our faces and try to do 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:49.200
 understand to citizens that they are not necessarily the administration 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.940
 anything else they drink going to clean things that maybe we do if we get dirty 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:58.180
 we are the first that need clean paved antennas which is why it is born 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:00.880
 initiative we leave everything to raise awareness 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.560
 all vendors bar on something that they would like to clean 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.920
 even the adivor to genre ashtrays I can hold together with others 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:10.439
 What do I feel for you 

00:02:10.439 --> 00:02:13.379
 this is a practical example of how 

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:16.429
 it takes little to be able to put the city 

00:02:16.429 --> 00:02:19.129
 in a tiny plastic affarino 

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:23.930
 close it and vote for it in any container, then just open it a little 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.349
 to keep the beach clean this will allow for a reduction of 

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:28.039
 trash 

00:02:28.039 --> 00:02:34.859
 yes sure list size. filippo-il this sensitization action but must 

00:02:34.859 --> 00:02:36.700
 be one of many that 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:41.060
 in agrigento where the actors of the operators are citizens where manna is 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.930
 tourist or commercial chains anyone 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:46.739
 must make this contribution some system today 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:49.739
 is no longer manageable today system 

00:02:50.639 --> 00:02:55.389
 is supported suppresses all of us citizens from operators was 

00:02:55.389 --> 00:03:00.250
 beautiful old following the first initiative tried on the 5th is May 5th 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:02.670

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:09.409

 to its customers an ashtray 

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:16.819
 from an ashtray on the busy stretch of beach then ahahah why 

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:21.319
 by the operators the citizens cannot make a contribution 

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:23.500
 the administration then has to do its part 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.520
 but we care about our side to prevent trying to reduce 

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:33.290
 what the refusal and above all to dirty - the city - gets dirty city 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:36.940
 and not even what the whole community could do to keep the city 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:42.060
 clean here is a little or a way we specify a beggar apple 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:46.800
