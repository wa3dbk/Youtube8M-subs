00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.660 
once on a twitcam but it didn't go very
well<00:00:14.610> so<00:00:15.000> I<00:00:15.059> thought<00:00:15.179> I'd<00:00:15.330> film<00:00:15.570> it<00:00:15.719> and

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:16.670

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:18.920 
well so I thought I'd film it and
hopefully<00:00:17.670> it's<00:00:18.180> not<00:00:18.270> going<00:00:18.390> to<00:00:18.480> go<00:00:18.570> the<00:00:18.720> same
