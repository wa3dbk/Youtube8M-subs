the first races and we haven't really
had<00:01:04.089> that<00:01:04.150> in<00:01:04.750> the<00:01:04.839> past<00:01:05.019> so<00:01:05.409> you<00:01:06.310> know<00:01:06.430> work

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:06.700 
had that in the past so you know work

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.370 
had that in the past so you know work
definitely<00:01:07.000> worked<00:01:07.330> for<00:01:07.510> me<00:01:07.659> last<00:01:07.690> year<00:01:08.049> that

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:08.380

was on the podium and liquidy is the
first<00:01:10.360> race<00:01:10.570> I<00:01:10.840> think<00:01:11.560> that<00:01:11.740> was<00:01:11.920> kind<00:01:12.760> of<00:01:12.909> a

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
first race I think that was kind of a

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.660
