00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.140
 because this time it made me very very very 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.759
 late but as always I ask you to 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.650

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.180
 this video series recalls the 

00:00:27.239 --> 00:00:32.640
 We went up Monday, Wednesday and Friday 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:34.290
 we found a car racing model this is going 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.210
 to be kind of good they are going to be 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.300
 car racing but the cars are 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:42.180
 little ones are like toy is very 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.170
 well created I liked pretty very simple 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.600
 you can see that here we have the 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.600
 controls is very very very simple to play 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.220
 and indeed 100 percent recommended 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.140
 friends take advantage that is completely 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:55.800
 Free today we also find 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.870
 to morgues mind on 2 this kind of 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.270
 games like that make me a 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:04.290
 addiction and right now I'm playing one that 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.369
 it's called woolwich something like that is called I think 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.040
 that always to be free that is 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.450
 free game but really like me 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.549
 is hooked today on the level 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.620
 forty- something is more or less to this 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:17.170
 you have to put together you have to do 

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:19.900
 then the pieces are joined not three pieces or 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:21.820
 more than each game of each monkey 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:23.500
 these are the ones I'm playing but in 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:25.390
 it's really super addictive I'm going to level 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.610
 forty- something I tell them and each time 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:29.140
 more addictive it should be illegal this 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:32.080
 type of games because it is very addictive 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:35.140
 zombies also find blood is 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:37.120
 well the game another by denying is very 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:39.610
 well achieved but I entered the category 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:41.890
 of frame yum you will always download 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:44.110
 it's going to be free but inside the game 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:47.230
 they already ask you to buy things that you 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:49.090
 they ask for a lot of money for having the game to 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:51.310
 full that's the bad part of that kind of 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:54.640
 games I'm not so fanatical about games 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:58.000
 premium we found to skate main is very 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:00.850
 good but to my point of view that 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.740
 they did this copy so I was the 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:03.850
 name of the game but you know which one 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.830
 is 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:07.720
 but it's also skateboarding the other 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:10.090
 I say no later you have to do it 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:12.970
 have to go from left to right and 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:15.730
 dodge wagons ajam I remember the 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:17.080
 name of the game that they copied but if 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.390
 they play they will realize it is a game 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.890
 very famous is also easy to 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.020
 identify but it's good to 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:25.390
 end of accounts is a max copy but 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:28.180
 Well, it's good, we also find 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:30.910
 speed book this is going to be so you can 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.950
 have your finances in order so that 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:34.989
 you know what you spent in that you kept 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:36.459
 when you lost when you won when 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:38.980
 you were able to save at the end of accounts 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:40.209
 they come out and the only bad thing that I do not like 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.910
 this application is that you have to 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:44.500
 record absolutely everything 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:48.069
 you've spent to make it work for you 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:51.219
 100% I do not know if you're going to buy 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:53.200
 a water in the store you have to 

00:02:51.219 --> 00:02:55.319
 register that you bought a water if not 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:59.139
 Well, it does not work properly 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:03:01.239
 We find mutu and this will be a 

00:02:59.139 --> 00:03:03.549
 Personalized agenda you will have your 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:05.469
 calendar and your calendar your watch you're going to 

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:08.829
 to be able to tell him to remind you of each 

00:03:05.469 --> 00:03:10.719
 how much do you have an appointment I have always 

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:13.000
 said I'm not such a fan of that kind of 

00:03:10.719 --> 00:03:15.280
 things I prefer to just put it in 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.519
 reminders on the iphone and ready sounds 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:20.769
 every day you want a day before 

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:22.689
 hour before 15 minutes before you can 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:25.120
 configure at least that's my 

00:03:22.689 --> 00:03:28.060
 opinion we also find a division 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:29.920
 It is very good but 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:32.410
 I dont know 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:35.440
 I do not know that's good but I always 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:38.020
 I take this type of monkeys or I go 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:41.290
 I compare it a lot with the game of zelda 

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:43.180
 the zelda game of the link I do not know why 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:45.010
 but that's how I always feel that way 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:48.160
 kind of games I always am 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:49.930
 comparing with the no if I feel that before 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:52.600
 had hooked so much with the game of 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:54.970
 zelda that now then everything I compare with 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:56.470
 He did not, but he was good at stake 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:58.360
 nothing more than if also in certain 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:00.790
 points ask you for money to buy 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:01.989
 things is the only thing I do not like this 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:03.640
 kind of games that no longer give you 

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:05.830
 free and no and enter category 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:07.900

 mathematics ranges from primary to 

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:16.329

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:18.040

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:20.290
