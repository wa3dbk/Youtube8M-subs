PhD student at the impr s from a PhD
project<00:00:15.570> the<00:00:15.719> main<00:00:15.900> question<00:00:16.289> is<00:00:16.470> does<00:00:17.279> light

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
project the main question is does light

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.510 
project the main question is does light
and<00:00:18.210> pollution<00:00:19.020> affect<00:00:19.770> the<00:00:20.279> biological

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
and pollution affect the biological

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.630 
and pollution affect the biological
cycles<00:00:21.510> of<00:00:21.779> birds<00:00:22.439> in<00:00:22.920> urban<00:00:23.490> environments

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:25.640 
cycles of birds in urban environments

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.920 
cycles of birds in urban environments
when<00:00:26.640> I<00:00:26.670> talk<00:00:26.880> about<00:00:27.029> light<00:00:27.359> pollution<00:00:27.689> I

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
when I talk about light pollution I

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.410 
when I talk about light pollution I
refer<00:00:28.289> to<00:00:28.500> light<00:00:29.010> and<00:00:29.340> night<00:00:29.609> light<00:00:30.179> that

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
refer to light and night light that

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.959 
refer to light and night light that
should<00:00:30.599> not<00:00:30.840> be<00:00:31.050> there<00:00:31.349> basically<00:00:31.949> because<00:00:32.520> in

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
should not be there basically because in

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.700 
should not be there basically because in
natural<00:00:33.390> environments<00:00:33.989> we<00:00:34.200> don't<00:00:34.380> have<00:00:34.500> any

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
natural environments we don't have any

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.520 
natural environments we don't have any
light<00:00:34.920> at<00:00:35.070> night<00:00:35.250> and<00:00:35.579> so<00:00:36.360> the<00:00:36.630> question<00:00:36.960> is<00:00:37.140> is

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
light at night and so the question is is

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.860 
light at night and so the question is is
this<00:00:37.770> light<00:00:38.100> at<00:00:38.250> night<00:00:38.460> affecting<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.450> animal

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
this light at night affecting the animal

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:46.869 
this light at night affecting the animal
and<00:00:40.079> if<00:00:40.440> so<00:00:40.710> how<00:00:41.160> and<00:00:41.690> how<00:00:42.690> do<00:00:42.750> animals<00:00:43.200> respond

00:00:46.869 --> 00:00:46.879 

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:49.490 

the<00:00:47.879> European<00:00:48.329> black<00:00:48.539> bird<00:00:48.780> is<00:00:48.960> the<00:00:49.110> perfect

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
the European black bird is the perfect

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.500 
the European black bird is the perfect
model<00:00:49.710> species<00:00:50.190> for<00:00:50.430> the<00:00:50.520> questions<00:00:50.940> that<00:00:51.149> I'm

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
model species for the questions that I'm

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.840 
model species for the questions that I'm
focusing<00:00:52.020> on<00:00:52.140> he's<00:00:52.620> doing<00:00:52.649> very<00:00:52.920> well<00:00:53.309> in

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
focusing on he's doing very well in

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.090 
focusing on he's doing very well in
urban<00:00:54.270> areas<00:00:54.690> so<00:00:54.899> actually<00:00:55.379> the<00:00:55.590> density<00:00:55.800> of

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
urban areas so actually the density of

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.819 
urban areas so actually the density of
black<00:00:56.520> birds<00:00:56.699> in<00:00:56.940> in<00:00:57.539> cities<00:00:58.020> is<00:00:58.230> higher<00:00:58.559> than

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
black birds in in cities is higher than

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.799 
black birds in in cities is higher than
the<00:00:58.980> density<00:00:59.100> of<00:00:59.399> black<00:00:59.609> birds<00:00:59.789> in<00:01:00.239> forest

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
the density of black birds in forest

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.690 
the density of black birds in forest
environments<00:01:03.680> from<00:01:04.680> previous<00:01:05.100> studies<00:01:05.519> we

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
environments from previous studies we

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.490 
environments from previous studies we
know<00:01:05.880> that<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:06.479> black<00:01:06.689> birds<00:01:06.930> living<00:01:07.229> in

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
know that the black birds living in

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.830 
know that the black birds living in
urban<00:01:07.830> areas<00:01:08.220> they<00:01:08.400> differ<00:01:08.640> from<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.420> black

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
urban areas they differ from the black

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.080 
urban areas they differ from the black
birds<00:01:10.080> living<00:01:10.290> in<00:01:10.500> forest<00:01:10.890> environments<00:01:11.700> in

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
birds living in forest environments in

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.380 
birds living in forest environments in
the<00:01:12.390> temporal<00:01:13.260> activity<00:01:13.530> on<00:01:14.189> both<00:01:14.670> a<00:01:14.909> daily

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
the temporal activity on both a daily

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.469 
the temporal activity on both a daily
and<00:01:15.659> on<00:01:15.810> a<00:01:15.930> seasonal<00:01:16.350> basis<00:01:17.060> what<00:01:18.060> we<00:01:18.210> wanted

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
and on a seasonal basis what we wanted

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.570 
and on a seasonal basis what we wanted
to<00:01:18.630> know<00:01:18.810> is<00:01:19.110> what<00:01:19.770> is<00:01:19.920> driving<00:01:20.189> these

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
to know is what is driving these

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.999 
to know is what is driving these
differences<00:01:21.240> that<00:01:21.540> we<00:01:21.930> observe<00:01:22.320> in<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:22.710> field

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
differences that we observe in the field

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.210 
differences that we observe in the field
what<00:01:23.520> is<00:01:23.549> causing<00:01:24.119> the<00:01:24.270> earlier<00:01:24.750> start<00:01:25.680> of<00:01:25.979> the

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
what is causing the earlier start of the

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.060 
what is causing the earlier start of the
singing<00:01:26.759> in<00:01:27.150> urban<00:01:27.659> areas<00:01:28.110> what<00:01:28.560> is<00:01:28.680> causing

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
singing in urban areas what is causing

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.969 
singing in urban areas what is causing
the<00:01:29.220> earlier<00:01:29.930> breeding<00:01:30.930> time<00:01:31.200> and<00:01:31.560> so<00:01:31.770> one

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
the earlier breeding time and so one

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.670 
the earlier breeding time and so one
idea<00:01:32.310> is<00:01:32.610> that<00:01:32.850> light<00:01:33.630> is<00:01:34.049> causing<00:01:34.560> this

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
idea is that light is causing this

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.249 
idea is that light is causing this
difference<00:01:35.159> because<00:01:35.549> the<00:01:36.270> length<00:01:36.630> of<00:01:36.930> the<00:01:37.079> day

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
difference because the length of the day

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.190 
difference because the length of the day
is<00:01:37.530> one<00:01:37.799> of<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.130> major<00:01:38.640> site<00:01:39.270> gaiba<00:01:39.689> for<00:01:40.170> a

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
is one of the major site gaiba for a

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.740 
is one of the major site gaiba for a
bird

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:41.750 
bird

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.300 
bird
and<00:01:42.750> so<00:01:42.930> the<00:01:43.049> first<00:01:43.259> thing<00:01:43.439> that<00:01:43.740> we<00:01:43.860> did<00:01:44.070> was

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
and so the first thing that we did was

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.060 
and so the first thing that we did was
capturing<00:01:44.880> wild<00:01:45.570> birds<00:01:45.869> and<00:01:46.140> tagging<00:01:46.890> them

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
capturing wild birds and tagging them

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.490 
capturing wild birds and tagging them
with<00:01:47.340> the<00:01:47.549> light<00:01:48.180> loggers<00:01:48.689> and<00:01:48.720> also<00:01:49.200> with<00:01:49.350> the

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
with the light loggers and also with the

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.340 
with the light loggers and also with the
radios<00:01:50.070> and<00:01:50.250> so<00:01:51.119> the<00:01:51.540> purpose<00:01:52.049> of<00:01:52.200> this

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
radios and so the purpose of this

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.410 
radios and so the purpose of this
experiment<00:01:52.710> was<00:01:52.979> a<00:01:53.369> force<00:01:53.759> to<00:01:53.820> figure<00:01:54.270> out

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
experiment was a force to figure out

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.050 
experiment was a force to figure out
whether<00:01:55.259> the<00:01:55.979> light<00:01:56.189> intensity<00:01:56.700> that<00:01:56.909> they

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
whether the light intensity that they

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.300 
whether the light intensity that they
are<00:01:57.210> exposed<00:01:57.750> to<00:01:57.899> during<00:01:58.619> the<00:01:58.860> night<00:01:59.039> is

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
are exposed to during the night is

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.539 
are exposed to during the night is
higher<00:01:59.580> in<00:01:59.940> cities<00:02:00.330> than<00:02:00.720> in<00:02:00.750> forests<00:02:01.530> and<00:02:01.770> the

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
higher in cities than in forests and the

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:05.270 
higher in cities than in forests and the
second<00:02:03.149> does<00:02:03.450> it<00:02:03.630> correlate<00:02:03.960> with<00:02:04.409> activity

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
second does it correlate with activity

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.370 
second does it correlate with activity
patterns<00:02:08.090> of<00:02:09.090> course<00:02:09.420> doing<00:02:09.660> these<00:02:10.110> kinds<00:02:10.350> of

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:10.380 
patterns of course doing these kinds of

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.589 
patterns of course doing these kinds of
experiments<00:02:10.860> only<00:02:11.280> in<00:02:11.610> the<00:02:11.730> field<00:02:12.060> is<00:02:12.330> really

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
experiments only in the field is really

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:14.360 
experiments only in the field is really
challenging<00:02:12.870> because<00:02:13.349> we<00:02:13.560> cannot<00:02:13.950> control

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
challenging because we cannot control

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.790 
challenging because we cannot control
for<00:02:15.060> other<00:02:15.209> confounding<00:02:15.930> variables<00:02:16.470> like

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
for other confounding variables like

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.539 
for other confounding variables like
food<00:02:17.130> like<00:02:17.269> temperature<00:02:18.269> so<00:02:18.660> what<00:02:18.810> I<00:02:18.840> did<00:02:18.989> was

00:02:19.539 --> 00:02:19.549 
food like temperature so what I did was

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:23.000 
food like temperature so what I did was
capturing<00:02:20.549> birds<00:02:21.209> from<00:02:21.660> forest<00:02:22.110> and<00:02:22.319> city

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
capturing birds from forest and city

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.309 
capturing birds from forest and city
areas<00:02:23.489> that<00:02:23.670> bringing<00:02:24.209> them<00:02:24.630> into<00:02:24.900> the<00:02:25.019> lab

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319 
areas that bringing them into the lab

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:27.910 
areas that bringing them into the lab
and<00:02:25.769> putting<00:02:26.549> them<00:02:26.700> in<00:02:26.880> two<00:02:27.090> different<00:02:27.330> rooms

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
and putting them in two different rooms

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.789 
and putting them in two different rooms
in<00:02:28.920> one<00:02:29.310> room<00:02:29.580> I<00:02:29.940> simulated<00:02:30.540> a<00:02:31.049> forest

00:02:31.789 --> 00:02:31.799 
in one room I simulated a forest

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:33.770 
in one room I simulated a forest
environment<00:02:32.489> so<00:02:32.730> with<00:02:32.940> no<00:02:33.120> light<00:02:33.360> at<00:02:33.569> night

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
environment so with no light at night

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.259 
environment so with no light at night
and<00:02:34.140> in<00:02:34.590> the<00:02:34.709> second<00:02:35.040> room<00:02:35.190> I<00:02:35.519> simulated<00:02:36.150> a

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:36.269 
and in the second room I simulated a

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:40.100 
and in the second room I simulated a
city<00:02:36.660> environment

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.250 

the<00:02:40.680> results<00:02:41.340> are<00:02:41.520> quite<00:02:41.700> clear<00:02:42.030> so<00:02:42.660> the<00:02:43.020> birds

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
the results are quite clear so the birds

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.320 
the results are quite clear so the birds
which<00:02:43.590> were<00:02:43.800> in<00:02:44.010> the<00:02:44.220> light<00:02:44.610> and<00:02:44.820> night<00:02:45.000> room

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
which were in the light and night room

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.020 
which were in the light and night room
that<00:02:45.660> started<00:02:46.020> to<00:02:46.140> reproduce<00:02:46.790> almost<00:02:47.790> one

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
that started to reproduce almost one

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:49.850 
that started to reproduce almost one
month<00:02:48.300> earlier<00:02:48.600> and<00:02:49.080> they<00:02:49.410> also<00:02:49.560> had<00:02:49.830> a

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
month earlier and they also had a

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:51.380 
month earlier and they also had a
different<00:02:50.310> activity<00:02:50.730> pattern<00:02:51.090> so<00:02:51.270> they

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
different activity pattern so they

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.360 
different activity pattern so they
started<00:02:51.720> to<00:02:51.840> sing<00:02:52.050> earlier<00:02:52.500> they<00:02:53.010> were<00:02:53.070> more

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
started to sing earlier they were more

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.010 
started to sing earlier they were more
active<00:02:53.580> at<00:02:53.940> night

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:56.020 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:00.480 

so<00:02:56.830> what<00:02:57.490> I<00:02:57.520> achieved<00:02:58.030> so<00:02:58.960> far<00:02:58.990> was<00:02:59.560> to<00:02:59.800> show

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:00.490 
so what I achieved so far was to show

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:02.430 
so what I achieved so far was to show
that<00:03:00.520> light<00:03:01.060> night<00:03:01.510> can<00:03:01.900> affect<00:03:02.320> the

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 
that light night can affect the

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:05.280 
that light night can affect the
biological<00:03:03.130> cycles<00:03:03.610> of<00:03:03.820> the<00:03:04.270> Blackbirds<00:03:04.780> but

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290 
biological cycles of the Blackbirds but

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:08.550 
biological cycles of the Blackbirds but
what<00:03:05.470> I<00:03:05.500> don't<00:03:05.860> know<00:03:06.220> yet<00:03:06.910> is<00:03:07.270> what<00:03:07.660> this<00:03:07.930> means

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
what I don't know yet is what this means

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.460 
what I don't know yet is what this means
eventually<00:03:08.890> in<00:03:09.580> terms<00:03:09.940> of<00:03:10.240> physiology<00:03:10.900> in

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.470 
eventually in terms of physiology in

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:13.770 
eventually in terms of physiology in
terms<00:03:11.710> of<00:03:11.920> genetics<00:03:12.610> and<00:03:13.060> in<00:03:13.270> terms<00:03:13.540> of

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 
terms of genetics and in terms of

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.740 
terms of genetics and in terms of
lifespan<00:03:14.380> in<00:03:14.620> the<00:03:14.770> end

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:16.750 
lifespan in the end

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:19.690 
lifespan in the end
ylai<00:03:17.750> tonight<00:03:18.170> is<00:03:18.409> an<00:03:18.590> important<00:03:19.159> issue<00:03:19.340> is

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700 
ylai tonight is an important issue is

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.589 
ylai tonight is an important issue is
getting<00:03:20.530> increasing<00:03:21.530> interest<00:03:22.189> from

00:03:22.589 --> 00:03:22.599 
getting increasing interest from

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:25.569 
getting increasing interest from
different<00:03:23.599> fields<00:03:24.200> of<00:03:24.319> research<00:03:24.560> in<00:03:25.040> biology

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:25.579 
different fields of research in biology

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:29.229 
different fields of research in biology
or<00:03:26.180> medicine<00:03:26.269> as<00:03:27.079> well<00:03:27.260> for<00:03:27.950> example<00:03:28.239> women

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:29.239 
or medicine as well for example women

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:32.500 
or medicine as well for example women
who<00:03:30.019> do<00:03:30.470> shift<00:03:30.769> works<00:03:31.069> they<00:03:31.280> show<00:03:31.519> higher<00:03:31.819> rate

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:32.510 
who do shift works they show higher rate

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:37.949 
who do shift works they show higher rate
of<00:03:32.840> breast<00:03:33.409> cancer<00:03:34.120> and<00:03:35.120> so<00:03:35.750> we<00:03:36.560> should<00:03:37.310> try<00:03:37.730> to

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:37.959 
of breast cancer and so we should try to

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:40.809 
of breast cancer and so we should try to
understand<00:03:38.959> whether<00:03:39.890> this<00:03:40.310> is<00:03:40.489> also

00:03:40.809 --> 00:03:40.819 
understand whether this is also

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:43.210 
understand whether this is also
affecting<00:03:41.359> wild<00:03:41.840> animals<00:03:42.290> and<00:03:42.650> we<00:03:42.829> are<00:03:43.010> really

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:43.220 
affecting wild animals and we are really

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:45.160 
affecting wild animals and we are really
looking<00:03:43.400> forward<00:03:43.819> to<00:03:44.090> go<00:03:44.540> on<00:03:44.750> with<00:03:45.140> our

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:45.170 
looking forward to go on with our

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:50.199 
looking forward to go on with our
research<00:03:47.650> the<00:03:48.650> most<00:03:48.799> unexpected<00:03:49.250> thing<00:03:50.030> you

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:50.209 
research the most unexpected thing you

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:55.659 
research the most unexpected thing you
ever<00:03:50.359> caught<00:03:50.750> in<00:03:50.780> your<00:03:50.989> net<00:03:51.310> was<00:03:52.310> a<00:03:52.760> drunk<00:03:53.150> man
