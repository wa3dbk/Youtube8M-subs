was<00:00:19.670> your<00:00:19.820> thoughts<00:00:20.000> um<00:00:20.539> we<00:00:21.140> just<00:00:21.320> knew<00:00:21.410> that

00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:21.439 
was your thoughts um we just knew that

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:23.380 
was your thoughts um we just knew that
it<00:00:21.590> was<00:00:21.680> a<00:00:21.710> really<00:00:21.829> tanky<00:00:22.189> team<00:00:22.369> comp<00:00:22.609> which<00:00:22.880> we

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:23.390 
it was a really tanky team comp which we

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:24.579 
it was a really tanky team comp which we
kind<00:00:23.599> of<00:00:23.660> light<00:00:23.839> because<00:00:24.019> we<00:00:24.140> already<00:00:24.259> had<00:00:24.499> his

00:00:24.579 --> 00:00:24.589 
kind of light because we already had his

00:00:24.589 --> 00:00:25.779 
kind of light because we already had his
ear<00:00:24.769> and<00:00:24.829> his<00:00:25.099> ears<00:00:25.249> probably<00:00:25.369> one<00:00:25.640> of<00:00:25.669> the

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:25.789 
ear and his ears probably one of the

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:27.669 
ear and his ears probably one of the
best<00:00:25.939> ap<00:00:26.659> carries<00:00:26.929> at<00:00:27.050> killing<00:00:27.289> tanks<00:00:27.560> because

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:27.679 
best ap carries at killing tanks because

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:29.079 
best ap carries at killing tanks because
the<00:00:27.829> soldiers<00:00:28.130> do<00:00:28.279> so<00:00:28.400> much<00:00:28.550> damage<00:00:28.579> so<00:00:29.060> I

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:29.089 
the soldiers do so much damage so I

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:30.849 
the soldiers do so much damage so I
think<00:00:29.300> that<00:00:29.419> we<00:00:29.509> had<00:00:29.689> a<00:00:29.869> really<00:00:30.230> good<00:00:30.409> draft<00:00:30.679> I

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:30.859 
think that we had a really good draft I

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:32.589 
think that we had a really good draft I
don't<00:00:31.009> think<00:00:31.130> they<00:00:31.189> expected<00:00:31.279> the<00:00:31.999> early<00:00:32.390> pic

00:00:32.589 --> 00:00:32.599 
don't think they expected the early pic

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:35.290 
don't think they expected the early pic
of<00:00:33.160> Nautilus's<00:00:34.160> ear<00:00:34.400> first<00:00:34.610> rotation<00:00:35.060> I<00:00:35.120> think

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:35.300 
of Nautilus's ear first rotation I think

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:36.729 
of Nautilus's ear first rotation I think
they<00:00:35.420> probably<00:00:35.899> wanted<00:00:36.290> to<00:00:36.350> get<00:00:36.470> his<00:00:36.590> ear<00:00:36.710> and

00:00:36.729 --> 00:00:36.739 
they probably wanted to get his ear and

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:38.620 
they probably wanted to get his ear and
later<00:00:37.010> rotations<00:00:37.460> and<00:00:37.610> since<00:00:38.420> they<00:00:38.510> got

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:38.630 
later rotations and since they got

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:40.330 
later rotations and since they got
gragas<00:00:39.050> first<00:00:39.230> pick<00:00:39.440> I<00:00:39.560> had<00:00:39.710> Rex<00:00:39.920> I<00:00:40.040> which<00:00:40.250> is

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:40.340 
gragas first pick I had Rex I which is

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:42.850 
gragas first pick I had Rex I which is
like<00:00:40.460> the<00:00:40.490> even<00:00:40.820> matchup<00:00:41.260> to<00:00:42.260> pick<00:00:42.440> later<00:00:42.680> on

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:42.860 
like the even matchup to pick later on

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:43.900 
like the even matchup to pick later on
in<00:00:42.980> the<00:00:43.040> dress<00:00:43.250> so<00:00:43.370> I<00:00:43.430> didn't<00:00:43.610> even<00:00:43.700> have<00:00:43.820> to

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:43.910 
in the dress so I didn't even have to

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:46.420 
in the dress so I didn't even have to
worry<00:00:44.030> about<00:00:44.210> that<00:00:44.300> so<00:00:44.660> actually<00:00:45.650> thought<00:00:46.310> the

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:46.430 
worry about that so actually thought the

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:48.010 
worry about that so actually thought the
pic<00:00:46.550> man<00:00:46.700> was<00:00:46.850> good<00:00:46.970> and<00:00:47.090> they<00:00:47.180> also<00:00:47.330> been<00:00:47.570> left

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:48.020 
pic man was good and they also been left

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:49.360 
pic man was good and they also been left
because<00:00:48.320> we<00:00:48.440> played<00:00:48.620> it<00:00:48.830> against<00:00:49.130> them<00:00:49.220> and

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:49.370 
because we played it against them and

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:51.250 
because we played it against them and
screams<00:00:49.640> a<00:00:49.730> lot<00:00:49.850> and<00:00:50.630> we<00:00:50.750> had<00:00:50.870> like<00:00:50.990> a<00:00:51.020> bunch<00:00:51.200> of

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:51.260 
screams a lot and we had like a bunch of

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.530 
screams a lot and we had like a bunch of
a<00:00:51.350> life<00:00:51.530> com<00:00:51.770> so<00:00:52.040> I<00:00:52.520> think<00:00:52.760> they're<00:00:53.120> they're

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:53.540 
a life com so I think they're they're

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:55.060 
a life com so I think they're they're
expecting<00:00:54.320> us<00:00:54.410> to<00:00:54.560> go<00:00:54.650> for<00:00:54.800> something<00:00:54.950> like

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:55.070 
expecting us to go for something like

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:56.320 
expecting us to go for something like
that<00:00:55.250> since<00:00:55.430> it<00:00:55.550> worked<00:00:55.700> well<00:00:55.880> against<00:00:56.120> them

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:56.330 
that since it worked well against them

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:58.300 
that since it worked well against them
they<00:00:56.870> banned<00:00:57.080> that<00:00:57.230> out<00:00:57.410> so<00:00:57.590> it<00:00:57.860> just<00:00:58.040> ended<00:00:58.190> up

00:00:58.300 --> 00:00:58.310 
they banned that out so it just ended up

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:59.500 
they banned that out so it just ended up
being<00:00:58.490> like<00:00:58.610> the<00:00:58.820> wreck<00:00:59.090> site<00:00:59.120> raucous

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:17.450 
think it's hard to tell because people

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:19.540 
think it's hard to tell because people
were<00:01:17.800> considering<00:01:18.800> a<00:01:18.860> couple<00:01:19.070> things<00:01:19.220> counter

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:19.550

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:26.770 
people think des REE omid counters his
ear<00:01:24.830> but<00:01:25.040> in<00:01:25.340> reality<00:01:25.640> the<00:01:26.060> zoo<00:01:26.240> can<00:01:26.420> push<00:01:26.630> on

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
ear but in reality the zoo can push on

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:27.880 
ear but in reality the zoo can push on
that<00:01:26.930> as<00:01:26.990> well<00:01:27.140> a<00:01:27.200> lot<00:01:27.350> early<00:01:27.680> and<00:01:27.800> can

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:27.890 
that as well a lot early and can

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:29.230 
that as well a lot early and can
potentially<00:01:28.010> take<00:01:28.430> it<00:01:28.550> straight<00:01:28.670> before<00:01:28.940> the

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 
potentially take it straight before the

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.390 
potentially take it straight before the
Azrael<00:01:29.540> even<00:01:29.810> like<00:01:30.470> ramps<00:01:30.710> up<00:01:30.890> gets<00:01:31.159> the<00:01:31.250> ring

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:31.400 
Azrael even like ramps up gets the ring

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.850 
Azrael even like ramps up gets the ring
blade<00:01:31.550> and<00:01:31.670> everything<00:01:31.909> like<00:01:32.030> that<00:01:32.090> so<00:01:32.860> I

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:33.860 
blade and everything like that so I

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.130 
blade and everything like that so I
think<00:01:34.400> that<00:01:34.729> just<00:01:34.760> as<00:01:35.030> ears<00:01:35.210> has<00:01:35.720> been<00:01:35.930> a<00:01:35.960> top

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:36.140 
think that just as ears has been a top

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:37.360 
think that just as ears has been a top
pick<00:01:36.290> in<00:01:36.320> the<00:01:36.470> meta<00:01:36.620> and<00:01:36.890> after<00:01:37.070> they<00:01:37.159> nerfed

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:37.370 
pick in the meta and after they nerfed

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:39.310 
pick in the meta and after they nerfed
casio<00:01:38.150> he's<00:01:38.330> still<00:01:38.540> probably<00:01:38.720> like<00:01:38.930> just<00:01:39.140> the

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:39.320 
casio he's still probably like just the

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.800 
casio he's still probably like just the
best<00:01:39.530> midland<00:01:40.190> champion<00:01:40.790> overall<00:01:41.210> he's<00:01:41.659> good

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810 
best midland champion overall he's good

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:43.780 
best midland champion overall he's good
early<00:01:42.110> game<00:01:42.260> he's<00:01:42.440> good<00:01:42.650> late<00:01:42.830> game<00:01:43.070> he<00:01:43.670> has

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:43.790 
early game he's good late game he has

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:45.399 
early game he's good late game he has
good<00:01:44.150> playmaking<00:01:44.540> ability<00:01:44.990> and<00:01:45.080> just<00:01:45.200> a<00:01:45.260> lot

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:45.409 
good playmaking ability and just a lot

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:46.360 
good playmaking ability and just a lot
of<00:01:45.440> damage<00:01:45.680> so<00:01:45.890> he<00:01:45.979> doesn't<00:01:46.100> have<00:01:46.280> many

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:46.370 
of damage so he doesn't have many

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:48.370 
of damage so he doesn't have many
weaknesses<00:01:46.610> and<00:01:47.090> Phoenix<00:01:47.750> is<00:01:47.810> just<00:01:48.020> a<00:01:48.080> got<00:01:48.229> on

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
weaknesses and Phoenix is just a got on

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.100 
weaknesses and Phoenix is just a got on
him<00:01:48.500> so<00:01:48.799> I<00:01:49.630> don't<00:01:50.630> know<00:01:50.690> if<00:01:50.750> teams<00:01:50.900> should<00:01:50.990> be

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:51.110 
him so I don't know if teams should be

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:52.660 
him so I don't know if teams should be
banning<00:01:51.409> it<00:01:51.500> or<00:01:51.680> they<00:01:51.860> should<00:01:52.040> prioritize<00:01:52.460> it

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670 
banning it or they should prioritize it

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:54.160 
banning it or they should prioritize it
higher<00:01:52.820> but<00:01:53.180> it's<00:01:53.570> something<00:01:53.750> I<00:01:53.960> think<00:01:54.049> is

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
higher but it's something I think is

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:55.450 
higher but it's something I think is
really<00:01:54.229> strong<00:01:54.560> for<00:01:54.770> us<00:01:54.830> because<00:01:55.010> I<00:01:55.159> feel<00:01:55.190> like

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:55.460 
really strong for us because I feel like

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:56.710 
really strong for us because I feel like
it's<00:01:55.610> a<00:01:55.670> stronger<00:01:56.000> pick<00:01:56.150> for<00:01:56.270> us<00:01:56.330> than<00:01:56.540> it<00:01:56.600> is

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:56.720 
it's a stronger pick for us than it is

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.480 
it's a stronger pick for us than it is
for<00:01:56.840> other<00:01:56.960> teams<00:01:57.229> so<00:01:57.500> if<00:01:57.740> they<00:01:58.070> get<00:01:58.220> his<00:01:58.340> ear

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 
for other teams so if they get his ear

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:59.620 
for other teams so if they get his ear
it's<00:01:58.640> not<00:01:58.760> like<00:01:58.880> they<00:01:59.000> instantly<00:01:59.299> win<00:01:59.540> the

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
it's not like they instantly win the

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:01.450 
it's not like they instantly win the
game<00:01:59.780> but<00:02:00.110> if<00:02:00.229> we<00:02:00.320> get<00:02:00.470> his<00:02:00.619> ear<00:02:00.830> than<00:02:01.070> like<00:02:01.280> he

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460 
game but if we get his ear than like he

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.880 
game but if we get his ear than like he
can<00:02:01.610> go<00:02:02.090> off<00:02:02.119> and<00:02:02.420> carry<00:02:02.570> a<00:02:02.630> lot<00:02:02.780> of<00:02:02.810> games<00:02:03.020> last

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:03.890 
can go off and carry a lot of games last

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:05.410 
can go off and carry a lot of games last

just<00:03:13.810> threw<00:03:14.109> like<00:03:14.290> I<00:03:14.379> think<00:03:14.560> we<00:03:14.620> probably<00:03:14.829> at

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 
just threw like I think we probably at

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:16.530

Baron<00:03:15.280> situation<00:03:15.670> really<00:03:15.790> bad<00:03:16.000> I<00:03:16.030> think<00:03:16.269> up<00:03:16.389> to

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540 
Baron situation really bad I think up to

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:17.580 
Baron situation really bad I think up to
that<00:03:16.659> point<00:03:16.780> it<00:03:16.900> was<00:03:16.959> really<00:03:17.230> clean<00:03:17.409> like

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
that point it was really clean like

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:18.750 
that point it was really clean like
people<00:03:17.769> are<00:03:17.829> gonna<00:03:17.950> say<00:03:18.099> that<00:03:18.220> was<00:03:18.310> a<00:03:18.370> passive

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
people are gonna say that was a passive

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.599 
people are gonna say that was a passive
game<00:03:19.090> but<00:03:19.659> for<00:03:19.810> us<00:03:20.019> they<00:03:20.500> elected<00:03:21.220> for<00:03:21.549> the

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:21.609 
game but for us they elected for the

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:23.339 
game but for us they elected for the
passive<00:03:21.939> game<00:03:22.090> like<00:03:22.269> we<00:03:22.510> sent<00:03:22.870> our<00:03:22.989> bot<00:03:23.170> lane

00:03:23.339 --> 00:03:23.349 
passive game like we sent our bot lane

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:25.140 
passive game like we sent our bot lane
bot<00:03:23.560> and<00:03:23.829> we<00:03:24.430> were<00:03:24.519> going<00:03:24.699> to<00:03:24.760> just<00:03:24.940> try<00:03:25.090> to

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.150 
bot and we were going to just try to

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:27.420 
bot and we were going to just try to
like<00:03:25.299> him<00:03:25.419> blame<00:03:25.599> them<00:03:25.780> at<00:03:25.900> the<00:03:26.190> line<00:03:27.190> lanes

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430 
like him blame them at the line lanes

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:29.430 
like him blame them at the line lanes
evenly<00:03:27.849> just<00:03:28.030> match<00:03:28.180> up<00:03:28.209> directly<00:03:29.199> like

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:29.440 
evenly just match up directly like

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:30.659 
evenly just match up directly like
toppling<00:03:29.739> vers<00:03:29.889> top<00:03:30.040> laner<00:03:30.250> at<00:03:30.370> that<00:03:30.489> point

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:30.669 
toppling vers top laner at that point

00:03:30.669 --> 00:03:32.640 
toppling vers top laner at that point
but<00:03:31.060> they<00:03:31.180> decided<00:03:31.540> to<00:03:31.599> send<00:03:31.780> a<00:03:31.870> bottling<00:03:32.410> top

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:32.650 
but they decided to send a bottling top

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:34.740 
but they decided to send a bottling top
which<00:03:32.829> is<00:03:32.859> good<00:03:33.430> for<00:03:33.459> us<00:03:33.730> because<00:03:33.910> we're<00:03:34.510> both

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750 
which is good for us because we're both

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:35.849 
which is good for us because we're both
just<00:03:34.930> going<00:03:35.109> to<00:03:35.169> be<00:03:35.230> farming<00:03:35.500> the<00:03:35.560> jungle<00:03:35.829> on

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:35.859 
just going to be farming the jungle on

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:37.530 
just going to be farming the jungle on
opposite<00:03:36.220> sides<00:03:36.400> were<00:03:36.549> like<00:03:36.940> the<00:03:37.150> junglers

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:37.540 
opposite sides were like the junglers

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.300 
opposite sides were like the junglers
and<00:03:37.810> top<00:03:38.260> layers<00:03:38.470> are<00:03:38.590> relegated<00:03:38.799> to<00:03:39.129> doing

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:39.310 
and top layers are relegated to doing

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:41.849 
and top layers are relegated to doing
the<00:03:39.370> same<00:03:39.519> things<00:03:39.849> but<00:03:40.419> the<00:03:41.290> advantage<00:03:41.440> we<00:03:41.680> get

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:41.859 
the same things but the advantage we get

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:43.140 
the same things but the advantage we get
is<00:03:42.010> we<00:03:42.159> have<00:03:42.370> dragon<00:03:42.669> control<00:03:42.940> because

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.150 
is we have dragon control because

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:44.520 
is we have dragon control because
dragons<00:03:43.269> on<00:03:43.540> the<00:03:43.599> box<00:03:43.750> out<00:03:43.900> of<00:03:43.930> the<00:03:44.019> map<00:03:44.199> so<00:03:44.379> by

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530 
dragons on the box out of the map so by

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:45.899 
dragons on the box out of the map so by
keeping<00:03:44.709> our<00:03:44.919> bottling<00:03:45.190> there<00:03:45.400> we're<00:03:45.819> getting

00:03:45.899 --> 00:03:45.909 
keeping our bottling there we're getting

00:03:45.909 --> 00:03:47.819 
keeping our bottling there we're getting
a<00:03:46.090> small<00:03:46.269> advantage<00:03:46.659> so<00:03:46.870> that's<00:03:47.440> pretty<00:03:47.680> much

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:47.829 
a small advantage so that's pretty much

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:48.899 
a small advantage so that's pretty much
something<00:03:48.010> that<00:03:48.190> we<00:03:48.250> kept<00:03:48.519> until<00:03:48.819> they

00:03:48.899 --> 00:03:48.909 
something that we kept until they

00:03:48.909 --> 00:03:50.789 
something that we kept until they
actually<00:03:49.030> default<00:03:49.659> they<00:03:50.109> put<00:03:50.379> their<00:03:50.500> top<00:03:50.650> on

00:03:50.789 --> 00:03:50.799 
actually default they put their top on

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:54.180 
actually default they put their top on
your<00:03:50.829> back<00:03:51.040> top<00:03:51.250> again<00:03:51.519> so<00:03:52.030> I<00:03:52.919> actually<00:03:53.919> think

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.190 
your back top again so I actually think

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:55.920 
your back top again so I actually think
that<00:03:54.280> that<00:03:54.489> was<00:03:54.609> like<00:03:54.790> a<00:03:54.970> good<00:03:55.479> situation<00:03:55.659> for

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:55.930 
that that was like a good situation for

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:58.289 
that that was like a good situation for
us<00:03:56.049> and<00:03:56.260> then<00:03:56.349> when<00:03:56.500> I<00:03:56.530> got<00:03:56.590> to<00:03:56.829> like<00:03:56.949> the<00:03:57.299> Baron

00:03:58.289 --> 00:03:58.299 
us and then when I got to like the Baron

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:01.170 
us and then when I got to like the Baron
part<00:03:58.919> we<00:03:59.919> just<00:04:00.250> gotta<00:04:00.430> pick<00:04:00.579> off<00:04:00.760> and<00:04:00.970> i<00:04:01.000> think

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:01.180 
part we just gotta pick off and i think

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:02.189 
part we just gotta pick off and i think
we<00:04:01.239> probably<00:04:01.359> should<00:04:01.599> have<00:04:01.659> finished<00:04:01.840> Baron

00:04:02.189 --> 00:04:02.199 
we probably should have finished Baron

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:03.420 
we probably should have finished Baron
but<00:04:02.349> we<00:04:02.530> were<00:04:02.650> kind<00:04:02.829> of<00:04:02.859> split<00:04:03.069> on<00:04:03.159> the<00:04:03.250> call

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430 
but we were kind of split on the call

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:05.610 
but we were kind of split on the call
like<00:04:03.669> I<00:04:03.879> thought<00:04:04.629> quass<00:04:04.870> was<00:04:05.019> in<00:04:05.109> a<00:04:05.169> good<00:04:05.319> good

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:05.620 
like I thought quass was in a good good

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:06.809 
like I thought quass was in a good good
position<00:04:05.979> to<00:04:06.010> engage<00:04:06.280> on<00:04:06.430> their<00:04:06.549> back<00:04:06.669> line

00:04:06.809 --> 00:04:06.819 
position to engage on their back line

and since jinx was bottom we might have

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:10.110

get off Baron easily and we took a lot

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:14.159 
get off Baron easily and we took a lot
of<00:04:13.239> damage<00:04:13.449> from<00:04:13.659> because<00:04:13.900> it<00:04:13.959> was<00:04:14.049> so<00:04:14.139> early

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:14.169 
of damage from because it was so early

00:04:14.169 --> 00:04:15.689

00:04:15.689 --> 00:04:15.699 
in the game so that was kind of like a

00:04:15.699 --> 00:04:16.620 
in the game so that was kind of like a
throw<00:04:15.940> there<00:04:16.120> that's<00:04:16.299> something<00:04:16.479> that<00:04:16.510> we'll

doesn't happen anymore and then after

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:21.060 
doesn't happen anymore and then after

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:21.070 
that it just kind of became like a

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:22.589 
that it just kind of became like a
back-and-forth<00:04:21.310> game<00:04:21.669> and<00:04:21.970> we<00:04:22.270> miss<00:04:22.419> played

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:55.930 
like the week's plan for scrims we

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:58.290 
like the week's plan for scrims we
review<00:04:56.470> both<00:04:56.770> of<00:04:56.920> our<00:04:57.010> LCS<00:04:57.700> games<00:04:57.910> with<00:04:58.120> the

00:04:58.290 --> 00:04:58.300 
review both of our LCS games with the

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:00.420 
review both of our LCS games with the
audio<00:04:58.600> synced<00:04:59.080> up<00:04:59.140> so<00:04:59.410> we're<00:04:59.560> like<00:05:00.220> really

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:00.430 
audio synced up so we're like really

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:02.220 
audio synced up so we're like really
going<00:05:00.760> in-depth<00:05:01.060> and<00:05:01.240> we<00:05:01.600> end<00:05:01.780> up<00:05:01.900> doing<00:05:01.930> like

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:02.230 
going in-depth and we end up doing like

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:03.720 
going in-depth and we end up doing like
a<00:05:02.260> three<00:05:02.500> four-hour<00:05:02.740> meeting<00:05:03.100> instead<00:05:03.520> of<00:05:03.670> a

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:03.730 
a three four-hour meeting instead of a

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:04.680 
a three four-hour meeting instead of a
scrim<00:05:03.940> black<00:05:04.090> which<00:05:04.240> I<00:05:04.330> think<00:05:04.480> has<00:05:04.600> been

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:04.690 
scrim black which I think has been

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:06.240 
scrim black which I think has been
helping<00:05:04.930> us<00:05:05.080> like<00:05:05.320> having<00:05:05.920> a<00:05:05.980> bunch<00:05:06.160> of

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:06.250 
helping us like having a bunch of

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:07.380 
helping us like having a bunch of
screams<00:05:06.490> like<00:05:06.610> we've<00:05:06.760> played<00:05:06.910> a<00:05:06.970> lot<00:05:07.120> of<00:05:07.150> games

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:07.390 
screams like we've played a lot of games

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:08.370 
screams like we've played a lot of games
together<00:05:07.570> I<00:05:07.750> don't<00:05:07.870> think<00:05:08.110> that<00:05:08.140> the

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:08.380 
together I don't think that the

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:10.290 
together I don't think that the
repetitions<00:05:08.980> are<00:05:09.280> as<00:05:09.550> important<00:05:10.060> for<00:05:10.150> us<00:05:10.270> as

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:10.300 
repetitions are as important for us as

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:12.660 
repetitions are as important for us as
just<00:05:10.870> like<00:05:11.020> being<00:05:11.440> able<00:05:11.620> to<00:05:11.710> think<00:05:11.890> more<00:05:12.010> being

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:12.670 
just like being able to think more being

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:15.120 
just like being able to think more being
able<00:05:12.850> to<00:05:13.000> just<00:05:13.200> prepare<00:05:14.200> more<00:05:14.440> and<00:05:14.740> like<00:05:14.980> have

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:23.440 
going to do and we line that all up so

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:25.410 
going to do and we line that all up so
we<00:05:23.800> go<00:05:23.950> into<00:05:24.100> the<00:05:24.220> scrims<00:05:24.430> really<00:05:24.790> focused<00:05:25.240> and

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:25.420 
we go into the scrims really focused and

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:26.700 
we go into the scrims really focused and
we<00:05:25.810> don't<00:05:25.960> really<00:05:26.050> care<00:05:26.170> about<00:05:26.320> winning<00:05:26.560> or

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:26.710 
we don't really care about winning or

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:27.960 
we don't really care about winning or
losing<00:05:26.920> the<00:05:27.100> scrims<00:05:27.310> as<00:05:27.430> much<00:05:27.580> as<00:05:27.700> just<00:05:27.820> like

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:27.970 
losing the scrims as much as just like

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:29.910 
losing the scrims as much as just like
practicing<00:05:28.630> the<00:05:28.840> small<00:05:29.080> area<00:05:29.380> we<00:05:29.530> need<00:05:29.740> and

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:29.920 
practicing the small area we need and

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:33.120 
practicing the small area we need and
making<00:05:30.460> sure<00:05:30.610> that<00:05:30.730> we<00:05:30.820> don't<00:05:30.970> slack<00:05:31.450> on<00:05:32.130> other

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:33.130 
making sure that we don't slack on other

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:34.800 
making sure that we don't slack on other
like<00:05:33.580> important<00:05:34.000> areas<00:05:34.270> later<00:05:34.480> in<00:05:34.600> the<00:05:34.690> week

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:34.810 
like important areas later in the week

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:36.120 
like important areas later in the week
so<00:05:34.960> like<00:05:35.170> the<00:05:35.320> first<00:05:35.470> couple<00:05:35.740> days<00:05:35.770> will<00:05:36.010> be

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:36.130 
so like the first couple days will be

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:38.310 
so like the first couple days will be
focused<00:05:36.490> on<00:05:36.600> certain<00:05:37.600> things<00:05:37.630> will<00:05:38.230> be

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:38.320 
focused on certain things will be

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:39.720 
focused on certain things will be
prioritizing<00:05:38.920> that<00:05:39.040> more<00:05:39.220> in<00:05:39.310> game<00:05:39.490> and<00:05:39.610> then

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:39.730 
prioritizing that more in game and then

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:40.680 
prioritizing that more in game and then
towards<00:05:40.000> the<00:05:40.030> end<00:05:40.090> of<00:05:40.270> the<00:05:40.360> week<00:05:40.480> we'll<00:05:40.660> start

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:40.690 
towards the end of the week we'll start

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:43.520 
towards the end of the week we'll start
screaming<00:05:41.170> more<00:05:41.350> like<00:05:41.500> LCS<00:05:41.920> we'll<00:05:42.640> have<00:05:43.180> more

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:43.530 
screaming more like LCS we'll have more

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:46.020 
screaming more like LCS we'll have more
even<00:05:44.530> games<00:05:44.740> that<00:05:44.890> we<00:05:44.980> try<00:05:45.130> to<00:05:45.190> just<00:05:45.730> play<00:05:45.850> like

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:46.030 
even games that we try to just play like

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:48.540 
even games that we try to just play like
we<00:05:46.150> would<00:05:46.270> in<00:05:46.390> LCS<00:05:46.690> and<00:05:46.990> I<00:05:47.950> think<00:05:48.280> that<00:05:48.430> that

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:48.550 
we would in LCS and I think that that

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:50.580 
we would in LCS and I think that that
kind<00:05:49.300> of<00:05:49.330> practice<00:05:49.720> regimen<00:05:49.990> has<00:05:50.200> helped<00:05:50.440> us<00:05:50.530> a

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:50.590 
kind of practice regimen has helped us a

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:52.260 
kind of practice regimen has helped us a
lot<00:05:50.680> more<00:05:50.830> than<00:05:51.040> just<00:05:51.220> like<00:05:51.490> having<00:05:51.790> that<00:05:51.880> one

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:52.270 
lot more than just like having that one

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:53.490 
lot more than just like having that one
extra<00:05:52.480> skin<00:05:52.720> block<00:05:52.930> early<00:05:53.200> in<00:05:53.290> the<00:05:53.380> week

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:53.500 
extra skin block early in the week

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:55.890 
extra skin block early in the week
that's<00:05:54.490> very<00:05:54.610> efficient<00:05:55.270> sounding<00:05:55.630> with<00:05:55.750> all

00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:55.900 
that's very efficient sounding with all

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:57.090 
that's very efficient sounding with all
of<00:05:55.990> like<00:05:56.020> the<00:05:56.260> meetings<00:05:56.560> and<00:05:56.740> stuff<00:05:56.800> um

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:12.190 
on the strong side like normally when I

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:13.230 
on the strong side like normally when I
see<00:06:12.340> a<00:06:12.370> champion<00:06:12.550> that<00:06:12.730> looks<00:06:12.940> super<00:06:13.210> good

see a champion that looks super good

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:15.930 
see a champion that looks super good
super<00:06:13.450> bad<00:06:13.810> i<00:06:14.020> feel<00:06:14.980> like<00:06:15.130> the<00:06:15.250> bed<00:06:15.460> is<00:06:15.760> just

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:15.940 
super bad i feel like the bed is just

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:16.980 
super bad i feel like the bed is just
people<00:06:16.240> not<00:06:16.360> knowing<00:06:16.540> how<00:06:16.690> to<00:06:16.720> play<00:06:16.900> the

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:16.990 
people not knowing how to play the

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:18.210 
people not knowing how to play the
champion<00:06:17.320> and<00:06:17.500> then<00:06:17.770> the<00:06:17.860> good<00:06:17.980> is<00:06:18.130> the

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:18.220 
champion and then the good is the

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:20.040 
champion and then the good is the
champions<00:06:18.580> potential<00:06:19.000> so<00:06:19.480> i<00:06:19.510> think<00:06:19.630> it's<00:06:19.930> like

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:20.050 
champions potential so i think it's like

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:22.260 
champions potential so i think it's like
pretty<00:06:20.350> strong<00:06:20.650> as<00:06:20.950> a<00:06:20.980> support<00:06:21.460> like<00:06:21.970> being

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:22.270 
pretty strong as a support like being

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:23.760 
pretty strong as a support like being
able<00:06:22.360> to<00:06:22.510> just<00:06:22.570> like<00:06:22.810> eat<00:06:22.990> your<00:06:23.170> ad<00:06:23.320> carry<00:06:23.590> and

able to just like eat your ad carry and

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:25.470 
able to just like eat your ad carry and
