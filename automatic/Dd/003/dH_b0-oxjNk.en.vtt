 is an Apple 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.470
 i 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:30.300
 we have a very impressive and also 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.870
 look guys where are we 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.640
 effectively on a new map and that is 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.260
 guys who already have this game 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.180
 because it's going to be my first 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.339
 departure on the map of atlantis a new 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.720
 map in convoy kraft in skyworks and the 

00:00:41.339 --> 00:00:44.579
 truth is that I would like to play it for 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:46.290
 see how to say let's see my 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.640
 live reaction and that you know my 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:49.199
 first impressions about this 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.729
 new map once good to see 

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:52.320
 first it looks good it reminds me of a 

00:00:50.729 --> 00:00:54.030
 little bit to the music map let's say in the 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.710
 distance from the islands yes I believe that 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.220
 pretty much maybe a little more 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.589
 music 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:00.629
 but hey, it would look like we have 

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:02.640
 the setting is like a temple of 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.739
 sea ​​is worth in the wooden sea ​​temple 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.970
 it perfect moment for me is 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.659
 Like, let's see what we see around here 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:11.729
 well two chests per island okay I do not know if 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.159
 there would be a hidden chest 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.720
 let's look for it can not be low 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:20.730
 Boys 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:22.470
 I promise you that if the first one is the most 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:24.240
 not though we have a hidden chest for 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.160
 island is not bad also the island to 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.810
 cheating has been mein kapital 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.400
 it's pretty good because there's no need 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.350
 chop much better I like I like 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.600

 quite and peak guys ok we are in the 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:04.439
 map studying that the islands have a 

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:05.579
 ideal distance sap also that those of 

00:03:04.439 --> 00:03:07.349
 cube that they have taken an example of 

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:09.420
 let's say the maps that we like to 

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:11.410

 seen to be horrible in physics we're going to 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.600
 try to go to the center of this game 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.100
 for that reason it catches me to the quid of the blocks 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:38.920
 instead of spying me the kit that 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:40.840
 normally he usually uses does not want to be of 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:43.150
 the armor but let's go inside 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:45.610
 quickly without anyone being able to 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:50.160
 avoid 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:50.160
 his life does not exist 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:57.360

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:02.070
 to play another part more in fact and 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:03.450
 center because the boat that looks very 

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:04.860
 beautiful 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:06.540

 with this deposit we do not know how to speak for 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:19.109

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:28.050
 life and everything we're going to see this is a 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:31.110
 ping and parkour that I think will happen 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:33.480

 frame as it leaves today is very nice 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:39.480
