00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:06.679 

here<00:00:05.220> at<00:00:05.370> the<00:00:05.430> University<00:00:05.910> of<00:00:05.939> Reading<00:00:06.210> we're

00:00:06.679 --> 00:00:06.689 
here at the University of Reading we're

00:00:06.689 --> 00:00:09.470 
here at the University of Reading we're
doing<00:00:07.049> a<00:00:07.290> study<00:00:07.740> looking<00:00:08.099> into<00:00:08.700> cat<00:00:08.910> behavior

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
doing a study looking into cat behavior

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.049 
doing a study looking into cat behavior
so<00:00:10.469> we're<00:00:10.620> looking<00:00:10.740> at<00:00:11.250> their<00:00:11.580> hunting

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
so we're looking at their hunting

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:14.840 
so we're looking at their hunting
behavior<00:00:12.240> specifically<00:00:13.250> and<00:00:14.250> whether<00:00:14.609> they

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:14.850 
behavior specifically and whether they

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:16.849 
behavior specifically and whether they
might<00:00:15.029> be<00:00:15.240> having<00:00:15.420> an<00:00:15.660> impact<00:00:15.990> on<00:00:16.289> wild<00:00:16.710> bird

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
might be having an impact on wild bird

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.370 
might be having an impact on wild bird
populations<00:00:17.609> within<00:00:17.850> urban<00:00:18.060> areas<00:00:18.600> bird

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
populations within urban areas bird

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.439 
populations within urban areas bird
populations<00:00:20.160> are<00:00:20.279> declining<00:00:20.310> because<00:00:20.999> of<00:00:21.269> big

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
populations are declining because of big

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.989 
populations are declining because of big
things<00:00:21.480> like<00:00:21.929> habitat<00:00:22.349> fragmentation<00:00:22.999> but

00:00:23.989 --> 00:00:23.999 
things like habitat fragmentation but

00:00:23.999 --> 00:00:26.480 
things like habitat fragmentation but
urbanization<00:00:24.839> is<00:00:24.960> a<00:00:24.990> major<00:00:25.320> thing<00:00:25.679> in<00:00:25.859> that<00:00:25.890> so

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
urbanization is a major thing in that so

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.960 
urbanization is a major thing in that so
the<00:00:27.359> more<00:00:27.509> buildings<00:00:27.929> we<00:00:28.109> have<00:00:28.349> the<00:00:28.619> less<00:00:28.800> of<00:00:29.099> a

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
the more buildings we have the less of a

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.640 
the more buildings we have the less of a
nice<00:00:30.150> environment<00:00:30.449> we<00:00:30.810> provide<00:00:31.140> for<00:00:31.319> our<00:00:31.409> bird

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
nice environment we provide for our bird

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.300 
nice environment we provide for our bird
populations<00:00:32.510> and<00:00:33.510> with<00:00:34.020> urbanization<00:00:34.590> comes

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:35.310 
populations and with urbanization comes

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:38.900 
populations and with urbanization comes
high<00:00:35.610> high<00:00:36.120> levels<00:00:36.480> of<00:00:36.660> human<00:00:37.440> densities<00:00:37.920> and

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
high high levels of human densities and

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.390 
high high levels of human densities and
with<00:00:39.120> people<00:00:39.510> comes<00:00:39.810> cats<00:00:40.080> so<00:00:41.040> the<00:00:41.160> first

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:41.400 
with people comes cats so the first

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.060 
with people comes cats so the first
thing<00:00:41.490> we<00:00:41.760> did<00:00:41.940> when<00:00:42.630> I<00:00:42.690> started<00:00:43.110> my<00:00:43.170> PhD<00:00:43.470> was

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
thing we did when I started my PhD was

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.130 
thing we did when I started my PhD was
to<00:00:44.370> recruit<00:00:44.700> cat<00:00:44.970> owners<00:00:45.330> into<00:00:45.600> the<00:00:45.690> project

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
to recruit cat owners into the project

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.610 
to recruit cat owners into the project
so<00:00:46.470> we<00:00:47.010> recruited<00:00:47.420> 180<00:00:48.420> people<00:00:48.990> and<00:00:49.470> their

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
so we recruited 180 people and their

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.010 
so we recruited 180 people and their
cats<00:00:49.830> into<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.370> project<00:00:50.820> I'm<00:00:51.510> really

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
cats into the project I'm really

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.600 
cats into the project I'm really
fascinating<00:00:52.620> cats<00:00:52.860> anyway<00:00:53.070> I<00:00:53.250> think<00:00:53.490> they

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
fascinating cats anyway I think they

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.730 
fascinating cats anyway I think they
have<00:00:53.760> such<00:00:54.060> independent<00:00:54.840> little<00:00:55.080> nature's<00:00:55.560> I

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:55.740 
have such independent little nature's I

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:56.960 
have such independent little nature's I
thought<00:00:55.950> it'd<00:00:56.130> be<00:00:56.160> really<00:00:56.490> interesting<00:00:56.940> to

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:56.970 
thought it'd be really interesting to

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:59.870 
thought it'd be really interesting to
find<00:00:57.120> out<00:00:57.300> what<00:00:57.480> they<00:00:57.660> do<00:00:57.720> a<00:00:58.140> to<00:00:58.890> help<00:00:59.250> out<00:00:59.490> with

00:00:59.870 --> 00:00:59.880 
find out what they do a to help out with

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:01.490 
find out what they do a to help out with
the<00:01:00.030> study<00:01:00.270> but<00:01:00.480> also<00:01:00.630> to<00:01:00.840> find<00:01:01.140> out<00:01:01.320> for

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
the study but also to find out for

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.470 
the study but also to find out for
myself<00:01:01.620> what<00:01:02.190> my<00:01:02.340> cats<00:01:02.640> were<00:01:02.760> up<00:01:02.970> to<00:01:03.210> tips

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
myself what my cats were up to tips

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.600 
myself what my cats were up to tips
really<00:01:03.810> interesting<00:01:04.470> well<00:01:05.040> we<00:01:05.159> just<00:01:05.339> make<00:01:05.579> a

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
really interesting well we just make a

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.340 
really interesting well we just make a
diary<00:01:05.939> of<00:01:06.299> all<00:01:06.479> the<00:01:06.630> things<00:01:06.780> that<00:01:07.020> they<00:01:07.140> bring

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
diary of all the things that they bring

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.360 
diary of all the things that they bring
home<00:01:07.619> if<00:01:07.920> they<00:01:08.310> do<00:01:08.369> take<00:01:08.940> any<00:01:09.120> prey<00:01:10.040> we<00:01:11.040> collect

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:11.370 
home if they do take any prey we collect

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:13.130 
home if they do take any prey we collect
it<00:01:11.610> and<00:01:11.790> we<00:01:11.909> get<00:01:12.060> in<00:01:12.150> touch<00:01:12.300> with<00:01:12.480> Becky<00:01:12.690> and

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
it and we get in touch with Becky and

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.350 
it and we get in touch with Becky and
she<00:01:13.290> comes<00:01:13.500> and<00:01:13.650> collects<00:01:14.100> it<00:01:14.280> we<00:01:14.940> have<00:01:15.180> been

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
she comes and collects it we have been

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.690 
she comes and collects it we have been
doing<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:15.870> predation<00:01:16.470> survey<00:01:16.980> for<00:01:17.310> over<00:01:17.670> a

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
doing the predation survey for over a

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.910 
doing the predation survey for over a
year<00:01:17.790> now<00:01:18.260> so<00:01:19.260> we<00:01:19.350> have<00:01:19.530> quite<00:01:19.740> a<00:01:19.770> lot

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
year now so we have quite a lot

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.969 
year now so we have quite a lot
information<00:01:20.040> about<00:01:20.700> what<00:01:21.030> cats<00:01:21.300> are<00:01:21.510> killing

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:21.979 
information about what cats are killing

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:24.380 
information about what cats are killing
the<00:01:22.979> big<00:01:23.340> question<00:01:23.820> that<00:01:23.940> we<00:01:24.030> have<00:01:24.180> at<00:01:24.300> the

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
the big question that we have at the

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.840 
the big question that we have at the
moment<00:01:24.420> is<00:01:24.960> where<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:25.890> cats<00:01:26.130> are<00:01:26.310> returning

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
moment is where the cats are returning

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.550 
moment is where the cats are returning
all<00:01:27.030> of<00:01:27.240> their<00:01:27.390> prey<00:01:27.630> to<00:01:27.990> their<00:01:28.140> owners

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
all of their prey to their owners

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.860 
all of their prey to their owners
although<00:01:29.520> we<00:01:29.700> found<00:01:30.030> that<00:01:30.210> quite<00:01:30.420> a<00:01:30.479> few<00:01:30.630> of

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:30.870 
although we found that quite a few of

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:32.540 
although we found that quite a few of
our<00:01:30.990> cats<00:01:31.200> are<00:01:31.440> going<00:01:31.770> out<00:01:31.890> and<00:01:31.920> killing<00:01:32.190> prey

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:32.550 
our cats are going out and killing prey

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:34.399 
our cats are going out and killing prey
we<00:01:32.850> want<00:01:33.030> to<00:01:33.150> know<00:01:33.180> what<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:33.690> other<00:01:33.720> cats<00:01:34.229> are

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
we want to know what the other cats are

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.050 
we want to know what the other cats are
doing<00:01:34.740> whether<00:01:35.010> they're<00:01:35.340> in<00:01:35.580> fact<00:01:35.760> not

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
doing whether they're in fact not

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.060 
doing whether they're in fact not
killing<00:01:36.360> prey<00:01:36.600> or<00:01:36.870> whether<00:01:37.140> they<00:01:37.350> are<00:01:37.380> killing

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
killing prey or whether they are killing

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.070 
killing prey or whether they are killing
prey<00:01:38.340> and<00:01:38.610> just<00:01:39.090> not<00:01:39.240> returning<00:01:39.690> it<00:01:39.780> to<00:01:39.930> their

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:40.080 
prey and just not returning it to their

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.860 
prey and just not returning it to their
homes<00:01:40.350> to<00:01:40.740> do<00:01:41.220> that<00:01:41.430> we'll<00:01:41.580> be<00:01:41.610> using<00:01:41.870> data

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:42.870 
homes to do that we'll be using data

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:44.840 
homes to do that we'll be using data
loggers<00:01:43.260> or<00:01:43.500> daily<00:01:43.860> Diaries<00:01:44.370> the

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
loggers or daily Diaries the

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.539 
loggers or daily Diaries the
acceleration<00:01:45.510> data<00:01:45.659> loggers<00:01:46.140> work<00:01:46.549> almost

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
acceleration data loggers work almost

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.450 
acceleration data loggers work almost
like<00:01:47.850> a<00:01:47.909> Nintendo<00:01:48.570> Wii<00:01:48.840> so<00:01:49.710> they<00:01:50.130> measure

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
like a Nintendo Wii so they measure

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.300 
like a Nintendo Wii so they measure
acceleration<00:01:50.960> so<00:01:51.960> whenever<00:01:52.320> the<00:01:52.740> data<00:01:52.979> logger

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
acceleration so whenever the data logger

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.520 
acceleration so whenever the data logger

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
measures that that information but

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.350 
measures that that information but
instead<00:01:59.010> of<00:01:59.159> transferring<00:01:59.400> it<00:02:00.030> into<00:02:00.180> a

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
instead of transferring it into a

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.780 
instead of transferring it into a
videogame<00:02:00.960> it<00:02:01.200> stores<00:02:01.560> the<00:02:01.710> information<00:02:01.950> on

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
videogame it stores the information on

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.410 
videogame it stores the information on
like<00:02:03.630> an<00:02:03.750> SD<00:02:04.049> card<00:02:04.080> having<00:02:04.920> your<00:02:05.040> camera<00:02:05.520> then

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
like an SD card having your camera then

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.929 
like an SD card having your camera then
we<00:02:06.570> can<00:02:06.750> take<00:02:06.869> that<00:02:07.020> information<00:02:07.080> and<00:02:07.700> we<00:02:08.700> can

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:08.939 
we can take that information and we can

00:02:08.939 --> 00:02:11.029 
we can take that information and we can
try<00:02:09.299> and<00:02:09.330> find<00:02:09.720> out<00:02:10.200> what<00:02:10.379> the<00:02:10.470> cats<00:02:10.679> are<00:02:10.769> doing

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
try and find out what the cats are doing

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.490 
try and find out what the cats are doing
at<00:02:11.159> that<00:02:11.189> time<00:02:11.340> so<00:02:12.180> cats<00:02:12.870> are<00:02:13.080> very<00:02:13.110> signature

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
at that time so cats are very signature

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.320 
at that time so cats are very signature
movements<00:02:14.430> so<00:02:14.760> when<00:02:15.390> they<00:02:15.599> are<00:02:15.780> going<00:02:16.530> to<00:02:16.800> hunt

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
movements so when they are going to hunt

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:18.880 
movements so when they are going to hunt
because<00:02:17.450> they're<00:02:17.600> ambush<00:02:17.930> predators<00:02:18.500> they'll

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
because they're ambush predators they'll

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:20.740 
because they're ambush predators they'll
the<00:02:19.550> course<00:02:19.790> or<00:02:19.970> crawl<00:02:20.240> along<00:02:20.420> the<00:02:20.600> ground

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
the course or crawl along the ground

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.320 
the course or crawl along the ground
almost<00:02:21.530> and<00:02:22.490> then<00:02:22.640> they<00:02:22.730> have<00:02:22.910> that<00:02:23.090> that

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.330 
almost and then they have that that

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.320 
almost and then they have that that
pounce<00:02:23.720> that<00:02:24.020> cats<00:02:24.440> always<00:02:24.970> do<00:02:25.970> when<00:02:26.180> they're

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
pounce that cats always do when they're

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.000 
pounce that cats always do when they're
jumping<00:02:26.690> on<00:02:26.810> their<00:02:26.960> prey<00:02:27.170> so<00:02:27.560> we'll<00:02:27.770> be<00:02:27.920> able

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
jumping on their prey so we'll be able

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:30.130 
jumping on their prey so we'll be able
to<00:02:28.220> pick<00:02:28.580> out<00:02:28.760> that<00:02:29.030> information<00:02:29.390> all<00:02:29.930> those

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
to pick out that information all those

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.770 
to pick out that information all those
signature<00:02:30.770> movements<00:02:31.340> from<00:02:31.580> the<00:02:31.790> data<00:02:32.000> when

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
signature movements from the data when

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:34.570 
signature movements from the data when
we<00:02:32.900> get<00:02:33.050> it<00:02:33.140> back<00:02:33.350> the<00:02:33.800> other<00:02:33.980> project<00:02:34.460> that

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
we get it back the other project that

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:36.250 
we get it back the other project that
we're<00:02:34.730> running<00:02:34.880> as<00:02:35.210> well<00:02:35.420> is<00:02:35.690> to<00:02:35.870> look<00:02:36.020> at

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
we're running as well is to look at

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.110 
we're running as well is to look at
where<00:02:36.860> our<00:02:37.100> cats<00:02:37.340> go<00:02:37.610> when<00:02:37.820> we're<00:02:37.970> not<00:02:38.060> looking

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
where our cats go when we're not looking

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.200 
where our cats go when we're not looking
so<00:02:38.750> we're<00:02:39.050> using<00:02:39.230> GPS<00:02:39.830> tracking<00:02:40.190> devices<00:02:40.640> and

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:41.210 
so we're using GPS tracking devices and

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:43.330 
so we're using GPS tracking devices and
it<00:02:41.570> has<00:02:41.690> never<00:02:41.840> been<00:02:42.020> done<00:02:42.230> on<00:02:42.530> domestic<00:02:43.130> cats

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
it has never been done on domestic cats

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.090 
it has never been done on domestic cats
before<00:02:43.820> the<00:02:44.360> GPS<00:02:44.960> actually<00:02:45.560> is<00:02:45.710> very<00:02:45.800> very

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.100 
before the GPS actually is very very

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.760 
before the GPS actually is very very
easy<00:02:46.310> to<00:02:46.550> use<00:02:46.580> and<00:02:47.120> it<00:02:47.210> allows<00:02:47.480> us<00:02:47.510> to<00:02:48.170> very

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:48.770 
easy to use and it allows us to very

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:50.650 
easy to use and it allows us to very
very<00:02:48.830> quickly<00:02:49.160> download<00:02:49.580> the<00:02:49.910> information<00:02:50.120> to

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660 
very quickly download the information to

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:52.960 
very quickly download the information to
the<00:02:50.690> computer<00:02:51.290> and<00:02:51.530> the<00:02:52.130> nice<00:02:52.310> thing<00:02:52.340> about<00:02:52.610> it

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 
the computer and the nice thing about it

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:55.060 
the computer and the nice thing about it
is<00:02:53.060> that<00:02:53.090> it's<00:02:53.780> very<00:02:54.020> visual<00:02:54.500> so<00:02:54.530> you<00:02:54.890> can

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:55.070 
is that it's very visual so you can

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:57.100 
is that it's very visual so you can
actually<00:02:55.220> use<00:02:55.490> Google<00:02:56.390> Earth<00:02:56.540> and<00:02:56.780> you<00:02:56.930> can

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:57.110 
actually use Google Earth and you can

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:59.350 
actually use Google Earth and you can
actually<00:02:57.260> see<00:02:57.470> where<00:02:57.920> the<00:02:58.070> cats<00:02:58.250> of<00:02:58.430> being<00:02:58.760> so

00:02:59.350 --> 00:02:59.360 
actually see where the cats of being so

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:02.830 
actually see where the cats of being so
the<00:02:59.480> GPS<00:02:59.990> actually<00:03:00.410> takes<00:03:01.070> a<00:03:01.570> fix<00:03:02.570> or<00:03:02.780> a

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840 
the GPS actually takes a fix or a

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.770 
the GPS actually takes a fix or a
position<00:03:03.380> of<00:03:03.530> your<00:03:03.709> car<00:03:03.980> every<00:03:04.790> minute<00:03:05.150> so

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
position of your car every minute so

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:07.780 
position of your car every minute so
every<00:03:06.500> minute<00:03:06.860> we're<00:03:07.250> getting<00:03:07.550> information

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790 
every minute we're getting information

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:10.480 
every minute we're getting information
on<00:03:08.209> exactly<00:03:08.420> where<00:03:09.020> your<00:03:09.170> cat<00:03:09.410> is<00:03:09.650> at<00:03:10.220> the<00:03:10.370> end

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:10.490 
on exactly where your cat is at the end

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:11.980 
on exactly where your cat is at the end
of<00:03:10.580> the<00:03:10.670> study<00:03:10.910> we<00:03:11.180> hope<00:03:11.480> that<00:03:11.750> we'll<00:03:11.870> be<00:03:11.900> able

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:11.990 
of the study we hope that we'll be able

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:14.170 
of the study we hope that we'll be able
to<00:03:12.230> get<00:03:12.410> information<00:03:12.590> to<00:03:13.130> actually<00:03:13.580> buys<00:03:13.820> cat

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180 
to get information to actually buys cat

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.720 
to get information to actually buys cat
owners<00:03:14.660> on<00:03:14.930> how<00:03:15.709> they<00:03:15.890> could<00:03:16.100> reduce<00:03:16.400> their

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.730 
owners on how they could reduce their

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:19.810 
owners on how they could reduce their
cats<00:03:16.970> impact<00:03:17.480> on<00:03:17.750> wildlife<00:03:18.280> so<00:03:19.280> we're<00:03:19.430> hoping

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:19.820 
cats impact on wildlife so we're hoping

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:21.850 
cats impact on wildlife so we're hoping
to<00:03:20.000> find<00:03:20.240> out<00:03:20.480> things<00:03:20.780> like<00:03:20.959> when<00:03:21.470> the<00:03:21.650> cats

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:21.860 
to find out things like when the cats

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:23.860 
to find out things like when the cats
are<00:03:22.070> most<00:03:22.280> active<00:03:22.459> when<00:03:23.060> they<00:03:23.300> are<00:03:23.450> hunting

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
are most active when they are hunting

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:26.199 
are most active when they are hunting
the<00:03:24.019> most<00:03:24.230> so<00:03:24.920> using<00:03:25.340> a<00:03:25.400> data<00:03:25.640> love<00:03:25.880> technology

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:26.209 
the most so using a data love technology

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:28.690 
the most so using a data love technology
will<00:03:26.630> allow<00:03:26.720> us<00:03:26.870> to<00:03:27.230> see<00:03:27.500> when<00:03:28.100> the<00:03:28.280> cats<00:03:28.489> are

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700 
will allow us to see when the cats are

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:30.880 
will allow us to see when the cats are
actually<00:03:29.000> out<00:03:29.120> and<00:03:29.390> about<00:03:29.630> and<00:03:29.900> hunting<00:03:30.380> we

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:30.890 
actually out and about and hunting we

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:33.400 
actually out and about and hunting we
expect<00:03:31.370> that<00:03:31.430> that<00:03:31.640> will<00:03:31.700> be<00:03:32.060> during<00:03:32.930> dawn<00:03:33.260> and

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:33.410 
expect that that will be during dawn and

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:36.670 
expect that that will be during dawn and
dusk<00:03:33.620> so<00:03:34.250> it<00:03:34.700> might<00:03:35.090> end<00:03:35.630> up<00:03:36.410> with<00:03:36.650> a

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:36.680 
dusk so it might end up with a

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:39.040 
dusk so it might end up with a
recommendation<00:03:36.890> that<00:03:37.760> people<00:03:38.090> could<00:03:38.360> keep

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:39.050 
recommendation that people could keep

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:41.110 
recommendation that people could keep
their<00:03:39.230> cats<00:03:39.440> in<00:03:39.680> overnight<00:03:40.130> if<00:03:40.400> they<00:03:40.820> felt

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.120 
their cats in overnight if they felt

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:42.790

that<00:03:41.239> their<00:03:41.390> cats<00:03:41.600> were<00:03:41.810> having<00:03:42.140> an<00:03:42.230> impact<00:03:42.500> a

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:42.800 
that their cats were having an impact a

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:45.310 
that their cats were having an impact a
lot<00:03:43.430> of<00:03:43.459> people<00:03:43.610> such<00:03:44.450> as<00:03:44.630> the<00:03:44.750> RSPCA

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:45.320 
lot of people such as the RSPCA

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:47.949 
lot of people such as the RSPCA
recommend<00:03:45.980> cats<00:03:46.250> wearing<00:03:46.640> bells<00:03:47.120> and<00:03:47.540> that

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:47.959 
recommend cats wearing bells and that

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:49.090 
recommend cats wearing bells and that
has<00:03:48.110> actually<00:03:48.260> been<00:03:48.530> found<00:03:48.830> to<00:03:48.980> reduce

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:49.100 
has actually been found to reduce

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:51.070 
has actually been found to reduce
predation<00:03:49.820> rates<00:03:50.090> because<00:03:50.390> obviously<00:03:50.660> it's<00:03:50.959> a

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:51.080 
predation rates because obviously it's a

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:52.840 
predation rates because obviously it's a
way<00:03:51.260> of<00:03:51.290> alerting<00:03:51.709> animals<00:03:52.370> to<00:03:52.550> the<00:03:52.670> cat's

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:52.850 
way of alerting animals to the cat's

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:54.910 
way of alerting animals to the cat's
presence<00:03:53.300> I<00:03:53.660> don't<00:03:54.110> think<00:03:54.170> my<00:03:54.320> view<00:03:54.590> of<00:03:54.650> cats

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:54.920 
presence I don't think my view of cats

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:56.290 
presence I don't think my view of cats
have<00:03:55.100> changed<00:03:55.370> that<00:03:55.519> much<00:03:55.550> I'm<00:03:56.030> really

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:56.300 
have changed that much I'm really

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:58.470 
have changed that much I'm really
interesting<00:03:56.870> to<00:03:56.959> find<00:03:57.110> out<00:03:57.350> what<00:03:57.560> they<00:03:57.739> do<00:03:57.800> and

00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:58.480 
interesting to find out what they do and

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:00.340 
interesting to find out what they do and
there's<00:03:59.480> also<00:03:59.600> they<00:03:59.810> have<00:03:59.959> their<00:04:00.080> own<00:04:00.170> little

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:00.350 
there's also they have their own little

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:02.380 
there's also they have their own little
independent<00:04:01.130> lies<00:04:01.310> and<00:04:01.580> I<00:04:01.640> know<00:04:01.700> for<00:04:02.209> certain

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:02.390 
independent lies and I know for certain

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:04.509 
independent lies and I know for certain
that<00:04:02.600> the<00:04:02.840> cats<00:04:03.050> just<00:04:03.320> go<00:04:03.590> they<00:04:04.220> have<00:04:04.370> their

00:04:04.509 --> 00:04:04.519 
that the cats just go they have their

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:06.759 
that the cats just go they have their
own<00:04:04.550> little<00:04:04.730> routes<00:04:05.060> during<00:04:05.720> the<00:04:05.900> day<00:04:06.110> so<00:04:06.470> if<00:04:06.650> I

00:04:06.759 --> 00:04:06.769 
own little routes during the day so if I

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:08.170 
own little routes during the day so if I
can't<00:04:07.010> wait<00:04:07.190> to<00:04:07.250> find<00:04:07.550> out<00:04:07.730> what<00:04:07.790> they<00:04:08.150> did

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:08.180 
can't wait to find out what they did

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:09.790 
can't wait to find out what they did
what<00:04:08.540> they<00:04:08.570> get<00:04:08.750> up<00:04:08.810> to<00:04:08.989> and<00:04:09.410> they're<00:04:09.500> wearing

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:09.800 
what they get up to and they're wearing

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:11.440 
what they get up to and they're wearing
these<00:04:09.920> things<00:04:10.190> well<00:04:10.700> I<00:04:10.730> think<00:04:10.820> that<00:04:11.030> cats<00:04:11.269> are

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:11.450 
these things well I think that cats are

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:13.449 
these things well I think that cats are
really<00:04:11.480> beautiful<00:04:11.989> interesting<00:04:12.890> creatures

00:04:13.449 --> 00:04:13.459 
really beautiful interesting creatures

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:15.789 
really beautiful interesting creatures
and<00:04:14.150> the<00:04:14.239> thing<00:04:14.450> I<00:04:14.600> most<00:04:15.049> interesting<00:04:15.590> about

00:04:15.789 --> 00:04:15.799 
and the thing I most interesting about

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:17.259 
and the thing I most interesting about
them<00:04:15.950> is<00:04:16.070> that<00:04:16.130> it<00:04:16.400> had<00:04:16.519> these<00:04:16.669> secret<00:04:17.120> lives

00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:17.269 
them is that it had these secret lives

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:18.580 
them is that it had these secret lives
that<00:04:17.630> we<00:04:17.720> just<00:04:17.810> don't<00:04:18.049> know<00:04:18.140> anything<00:04:18.380> about

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:18.590 
that we just don't know anything about

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:21.729 
that we just don't know anything about
so<00:04:19.280> using<00:04:20.120> the<00:04:20.209> GPS<00:04:20.690> and<00:04:21.140> the<00:04:21.229> data<00:04:21.470> logger

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:21.739 
so using the GPS and the data logger

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:23.890 
so using the GPS and the data logger
technology<00:04:22.280> will<00:04:22.460> give<00:04:22.970> us<00:04:23.120> a<00:04:23.300> really<00:04:23.750> good

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:23.900 
technology will give us a really good

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:26.110 
technology will give us a really good
insight<00:04:24.350> into<00:04:24.710> what<00:04:24.890> cats<00:04:25.250> are<00:04:25.490> getting<00:04:25.789> up<00:04:25.910> to

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:26.120 
insight into what cats are getting up to

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:28.750 
insight into what cats are getting up to
and<00:04:26.330> we're<00:04:26.450> not<00:04:26.570> watching
