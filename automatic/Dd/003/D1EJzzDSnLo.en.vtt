00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
would really have to look into the

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.420 
would really have to look into the
long-term<00:01:09.360> health<00:01:09.990> hazards<00:01:10.619> of<00:01:10.950> drinking

these<00:01:11.549> things<00:01:11.820> over<00:01:12.090> time<00:01:12.299> right<00:01:12.540> so<00:01:12.840> if

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
these things over time right so if

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.200 
these things over time right so if
you're<00:01:13.170> drinking<00:01:13.439> it<00:01:13.740> just<00:01:14.340> to<00:01:14.580> stay<00:01:14.820> up<00:01:15.000> and

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
you're drinking it just to stay up and

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.270 
you're drinking it just to stay up and
stay<00:01:15.420> energetic<00:01:16.020> for<00:01:16.259> midterms<00:01:16.680> and<00:01:16.860> finals

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
stay energetic for midterms and finals

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.410 
stay energetic for midterms and finals
but<00:01:17.460> other<00:01:17.670> than<00:01:17.820> that<00:01:17.880> you<00:01:18.119> don't<00:01:18.270> really

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
but other than that you don't really

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.870 
but other than that you don't really
drink<00:01:18.689> them<00:01:18.960> I'm<00:01:19.170> sure<00:01:19.650> it'll<00:01:19.799> be<00:01:19.950> fine<00:01:20.250> but

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
drink them I'm sure it'll be fine but

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.550 
drink them I'm sure it'll be fine but
keep<00:01:21.210> in<00:01:21.360> mind<00:01:21.390> that<00:01:21.780> these<00:01:21.900> drinks<00:01:22.350> have<00:01:22.530> a

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
keep in mind that these drinks have a

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.390 
keep in mind that these drinks have a
high<00:01:23.040> amount<00:01:23.640> of<00:01:23.790> sugar<00:01:24.290> they<00:01:25.400> accelerate

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
high amount of sugar they accelerate

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.940 
high amount of sugar they accelerate
your<00:01:26.580> heart<00:01:26.880> rate<00:01:27.090> and<00:01:27.960> that's<00:01:28.380> not<00:01:28.710> a<00:01:28.740> good

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
your heart rate and that's not a good

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:29.420 
your heart rate and that's not a good
thing

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
thing

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.580 
thing
so<00:01:29.759> drinking<00:01:30.060> them<00:01:30.210> regularly<00:01:30.659> is<00:01:31.110> not<00:01:31.350> a<00:01:31.380> good

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
so drinking them regularly is not a good

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.370 
so drinking them regularly is not a good
idea<00:01:31.710> however<00:01:32.700> if<00:01:33.630> you're<00:01:33.810> just<00:01:34.049> gonna<00:01:34.200> drink

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
idea however if you're just gonna drink

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.399 
idea however if you're just gonna drink
it<00:01:34.530> for<00:01:35.490> like<00:01:35.640> a<00:01:35.670> week<00:01:35.790> just<00:01:36.210> to<00:01:36.329> cram<00:01:36.600> I'm<00:01:37.140> sure

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
it for like a week just to cram I'm sure

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.560 
it for like a week just to cram I'm sure
it'll<00:01:37.590> be<00:01:37.710> fine<00:01:37.740> but<00:01:38.549> you<00:01:38.790> should<00:01:39.240> definitely

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
it'll be fine but you should definitely

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.230 
it'll be fine but you should definitely
look<00:01:39.689> into<00:01:39.810> the<00:01:40.079> risks<00:01:40.409> and<00:01:40.619> and<00:01:41.119> you<00:01:42.119> know

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
look into the risks and and you know

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
reports that have been written about it

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.020 
reports that have been written about it
however<00:01:44.130> it<00:01:44.189> should<00:01:44.340> be<00:01:44.430> noted<00:01:44.700> we<00:01:44.790> are<00:01:44.880> not
