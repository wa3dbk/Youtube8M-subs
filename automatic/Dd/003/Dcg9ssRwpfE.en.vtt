00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.820 

I<00:00:27.330> took<00:00:28.330> I<00:00:28.480> had<00:00:28.660> this<00:00:28.750> idea<00:00:28.900> who<00:00:29.380> all<00:00:29.710> these

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:29.830 
I took I had this idea who all these

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:31.859 
I took I had this idea who all these
hands<00:00:30.279> just<00:00:30.520> started<00:00:30.730> coming<00:00:30.910> out<00:00:31.150> all

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:31.869

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:35.549 
hands just started coming out all
grabber<00:00:32.140> um<00:00:33.090> sounds<00:00:34.090> pretty<00:00:34.210> spooky<00:00:34.840> and<00:00:35.440> then

00:00:35.549 --> 00:00:35.559 
grabber um sounds pretty spooky and then

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:36.750 
grabber um sounds pretty spooky and then
I<00:00:35.590> thought<00:00:35.800> would<00:00:35.950> be<00:00:36.040> very<00:00:36.070> nice<00:00:36.400> if<00:00:36.430> the

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:36.760 
I thought would be very nice if the

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.990 
I thought would be very nice if the
hands<00:00:37.629> started<00:00:38.050> talking<00:00:38.650> to<00:00:38.710> her<00:00:38.920> I<00:00:39.250> remember

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:40.000 
hands started talking to her I remember

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.069 
hands started talking to her I remember
seeing<00:00:40.150> people<00:00:40.270> doing<00:00:40.600> those<00:00:40.750> things<00:00:40.900> where

00:00:41.069 --> 00:00:41.079 
seeing people doing those things where

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:42.750 
seeing people doing those things where
they<00:00:41.140> paint<00:00:41.350> lipstick<00:00:41.800> on<00:00:41.920> their<00:00:42.129> hand<00:00:42.580> like

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:42.760 
they paint lipstick on their hand like

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.000 
they paint lipstick on their hand like
that<00:00:42.790> and<00:00:43.000> then<00:00:43.390> two<00:00:43.660> eyes<00:00:43.809> and<00:00:44.320> then<00:00:44.440> they<00:00:44.590> hit

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:45.010 
that and then two eyes and then they hit

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:46.259 
that and then two eyes and then they hit
and<00:00:45.190> so<00:00:45.309> I<00:00:45.340> thought<00:00:45.489> what<00:00:45.730> are<00:00:45.820> the<00:00:45.879> hands<00:00:46.150> get

00:00:46.259 --> 00:00:46.269 
and so I thought what are the hands get

00:00:46.269 --> 00:00:47.460 
and so I thought what are the hands get
some<00:00:46.480> lipstick<00:00:46.870> and<00:00:46.989> does<00:00:47.110> that<00:00:47.260> and<00:00:47.410> it

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:47.470 
some lipstick and does that and it

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:50.729 
some lipstick and does that and it
starts<00:00:47.650> talking<00:00:47.920> to<00:00:48.190> to<00:00:48.970> her<00:00:49.960> and<00:00:50.530> then<00:00:50.680> I

00:00:50.729 --> 00:00:50.739 
starts talking to to her and then I

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:53.100 
starts talking to to her and then I
think<00:00:50.920> um<00:00:51.250> Jim<00:00:52.059> liked<00:00:52.300> the<00:00:52.420> idea<00:00:52.660> the<00:00:52.750> shaft<00:00:52.989> of

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:53.110 
think um Jim liked the idea the shaft of

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:54.240 
think um Jim liked the idea the shaft of
hands<00:00:53.260> and<00:00:53.410> he<00:00:53.470> suggested<00:00:53.890> that<00:00:53.949> hands

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:54.250 
hands and he suggested that hands

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:55.979 
hands and he suggested that hands
actually<00:00:54.460> should<00:00:54.760> just<00:00:55.330> form<00:00:55.510> face<00:00:55.750> it

00:00:55.979 --> 00:00:55.989 
actually should just form face it

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:59.009 
actually should just form face it
probably<00:00:56.290> can<00:00:56.530> be<00:00:56.680> done<00:00:56.860> but<00:00:57.160> gia<00:00:57.370> turned<00:00:58.019> and

00:00:59.009 --> 00:00:59.019 
probably can be done but gia turned and

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:02.460 
probably can be done but gia turned and
actually<00:00:59.350> one<00:00:59.530> person<00:00:59.890> doing<00:01:00.070> Oh<00:01:01.229> both<00:01:02.229> odds

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:02.470 
actually one person doing Oh both odds

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:03.750 
actually one person doing Oh both odds
