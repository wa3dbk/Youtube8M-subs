00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
circular and this is square you can

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.139 
circular and this is square you can
round<00:00:36.239> it<00:00:36.390> off<00:00:36.540> or<00:00:36.780> whatever<00:00:37.160> it<00:00:38.160> has<00:00:38.370> a<00:00:38.399> very

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149

thick 3m VHB type of adhesive and

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:47.569 
thick 3m VHB type of adhesive and
obviously<00:00:46.170> this<00:00:46.800> will<00:00:47.039> stick<00:00:47.309> on<00:00:47.460> the<00:00:47.550> bottom

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
obviously this will stick on the bottom

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:52.040 
obviously this will stick on the bottom
and<00:00:48.030> then<00:00:48.180> you<00:00:48.329> will<00:00:48.450> mount<00:00:48.629> it<00:00:48.899> onto<00:00:49.050> the<00:00:51.050> boat

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
could put it on multiple items but

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.300 
could put it on multiple items but
anyway<00:01:10.260> you<00:01:10.320> get<00:01:10.710> a<00:01:10.760> get<00:01:11.760> those<00:01:11.970> pieces<00:01:13.310> you

get the standard mount that comes on the
bottom<00:01:18.000> of<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.150> housing<00:01:18.360> to<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:18.750> camera<00:01:19.229> and

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
bottom of the housing to the camera and

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.380 
bottom of the housing to the camera and
this<00:01:20.040> new<00:01:20.250> piece<00:01:20.520> which<00:01:21.030> I've<00:01:21.180> never<00:01:21.210> seen

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
this new piece which I've never seen

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:27.830 
this new piece which I've never seen
before<00:01:23.270> which<00:01:24.270> will<00:01:24.509> obviously<00:01:26.780> allow<00:01:27.780> the

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
before which will obviously allow the

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.690 
before which will obviously allow the
camera<00:01:28.500> to<00:01:28.710> be

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:43.700 

um<00:01:34.430> looks<00:01:35.430> like

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:51.970 

huh<00:01:44.479> okay<00:01:45.479> this<00:01:46.140> is<00:01:46.350> interesting

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:51.980 

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:54.250 

you've<00:01:52.580> got<00:01:52.730> another<00:01:53.000> supposed<00:01:53.960> to<00:01:54.020> be<00:01:54.080> like<00:01:54.230> a

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:54.260 
you've got another supposed to be like a

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:59.260 
you've got another supposed to be like a
safety<00:01:54.680> part<00:01:55.150> that<00:01:56.150> obviously<00:01:57.940> comes<00:01:58.940> with

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.270 
safety part that obviously comes with

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:04.470 
safety part that obviously comes with
the<00:02:00.020> piece<00:02:00.460> there's<00:02:01.460> not<00:02:01.580> any<00:02:01.760> kind<00:02:01.970> of<00:02:02.180> manual

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:04.480 
the piece there's not any kind of manual

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:08.020 
the piece there's not any kind of manual
so<00:02:05.480> I'll<00:02:05.600> have<00:02:05.900> to<00:02:05.960> look<00:02:06.200> into<00:02:06.380> this<00:02:06.740> but<00:02:07.730> I

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
so I'll have to look into this but I

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.610 
so I'll have to look into this but I
believe<00:02:08.720> this<00:02:08.900> either<00:02:09.140> connects<00:02:09.650> to<00:02:09.860> hear

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
believe this either connects to hear

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.680 
believe this either connects to hear
usually<00:02:12.620> going<00:02:12.710> to<00:02:12.770> be<00:02:12.890> a<00:02:12.920> screw<00:02:13.280> involved<00:02:13.760> no

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
usually going to be a screw involved no

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:21.810 
usually going to be a screw involved no
longer<00:02:15.110> piece<00:02:16.870> and<00:02:18.370> then<00:02:19.370> this<00:02:19.610> would<00:02:19.820> mount

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:21.820 
longer piece and then this would mount

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:30.400 
longer piece and then this would mount
onto<00:02:22.820> here<00:02:24.280> and<00:02:25.280> then

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:34.390 

I'm<00:02:30.890> thinking<00:02:31.070> this<00:02:31.460> goes<00:02:31.700> in<00:02:31.940> there<00:02:32.150> or<00:02:33.400> see

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
I'm thinking this goes in there or see

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.670 
I'm thinking this goes in there or see
the<00:02:34.520> camera<00:02:34.760> is<00:02:34.910> going<00:02:34.940> to<00:02:35.090> be<00:02:35.240> there<00:02:35.680> I've

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
the camera is going to be there I've

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.260 
the camera is going to be there I've
been<00:02:36.890> looking<00:02:36.950> to<00:02:37.280> see<00:02:37.430> what<00:02:37.580> this<00:02:37.700> piece<00:02:37.940> does

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:38.270 
been looking to see what this piece does

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:40.300 
been looking to see what this piece does

basically<00:02:55.490> it<00:02:55.850> just<00:02:55.910> goes<00:02:56.240> here<00:02:56.690> and<00:02:56.870> you

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:57.140 
basically it just goes here and you

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.710 
basically it just goes here and you
press<00:02:57.440> down<00:02:57.500> on<00:02:57.860> it<00:02:58.130> and<00:02:58.520> that<00:02:58.550> will<00:02:59.330> keep<00:02:59.540> this

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
piece from rattling so you don't get

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:04.000 
piece from rattling so you don't get
that<00:03:01.070> rally<00:03:01.460> near<00:03:01.730> audio<00:03:02.650> so<00:03:03.650> that's<00:03:03.830> that's

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
that rally near audio so that's that's
