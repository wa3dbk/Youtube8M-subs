00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 hello to you with alexander and welcome 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.779
 my heading to the epic card 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:09.510
 maykravt today we have a map which I 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:11.759
 call minotaur island why ask 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.549
 you are because there is a huge 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:17.910
 minotaur right in the middle and he tries 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:20.279
 grab some airship with one hand 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:23.850
 he even managed to grab hold but the author is 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:26.160
 it's time to wipe the same time we 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:29.840
 we can pay attention to what he has 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:32.399
 legs but like water she grabs him here 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:35.570
 that is, the water hangs in the air very much 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:37.829
 cool done i really like and 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:39.660
 Immediately I want to say that you can now 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.390
 You will see a longer cut cards 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.969
 really stupidly loaded it does not 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:48.050
 wants to dive on the map itself 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:52.940
 there are three such islands 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:57.270
 small about them there is such a hal 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:01:00.300
 I don't even know how to carry on 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:03.180
 that with her in general we are sick just like that 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:06.150
 can say but she's epic like that 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.610
 the temple he is very accomplished that is we 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.860
 can be attention to each 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.729
 the detail is here the steps are there there 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.570
 half blocks 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:19.590
 and so on there rbu bay theme here 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:23.000
 such an island and actually here as well 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:25.710
 there are some more islands 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.439
 here actually this first island he 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:33.509
 2 Left of center but the view third from right 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:37.650
 and this is the lowest right this 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:40.049
 chip and higher this higher they are nothing 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:44.189
 they just look awesome 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:47.640
 there is also such a tree here 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:50.880
 I know why he is with novak this is unusual 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:53.729
 so there is nothing else you can 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.760
 use this card basically for 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:58.340
 his strained spawn 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:00.500

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.970
