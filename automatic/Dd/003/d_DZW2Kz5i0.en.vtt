00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:44.460
 up to three years 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.310
 He escapes play but I say once again the lap times everything in Holland 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:53.610
 but the man dancing the Siemens dance next to the predictions 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.050
 let's take this in this 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.050

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:11.330
 especially comfort is not 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.100
 small part of the damage still costs in the areas 

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:20.880
