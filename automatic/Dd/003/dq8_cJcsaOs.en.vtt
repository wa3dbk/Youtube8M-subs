very good your stabilizers are working
to<00:01:17.000> a<00:01:17.030> great<00:01:17.300> extent<00:01:17.690> any<00:01:18.560> unilateral

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:18.920 
to a great extent any unilateral

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.860 
to a great extent any unilateral
exercise<00:01:19.640> your<00:01:19.880> stabilizers<00:01:20.450> work<00:01:20.659> to<00:01:20.840> a

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:20.870 
exercise your stabilizers work to a

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:23.340 
exercise your stabilizers work to a
great<00:01:21.229> great<00:01:21.560> extent<00:01:22.010> so<00:01:22.610> you<00:01:22.700> should<00:01:22.820> always

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:23.350 
great great extent so you should always

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:25.890 
great great extent so you should always
involve<00:01:24.350> such<00:01:24.530> type<00:01:24.770> of<00:01:24.799> exercise<00:01:25.310> in<00:01:25.549> your

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:25.900 
involve such type of exercise in your

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:30.100 
involve such type of exercise in your
exercise<00:01:26.900> routines<00:01:28.270> very<00:01:29.270> very<00:01:29.420> important<00:01:30.049> to

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:30.110 
exercise routines very very important to

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:31.539 
exercise routines very very important to
keep<00:01:30.260> in<00:01:30.380> mind<00:01:30.440> that<00:01:30.710> the<00:01:30.860> elbow<00:01:31.159> is<00:01:31.220> not

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:31.549 
keep in mind that the elbow is not

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:33.730 
keep in mind that the elbow is not
banging<00:01:32.390> down<00:01:32.540> but<00:01:32.780> it's<00:01:32.930> just<00:01:33.140> touching<00:01:33.530> the

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:33.740 
banging down but it's just touching the

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:35.890 
banging down but it's just touching the
floor<00:01:34.369> for<00:01:34.640> a<00:01:34.700> few<00:01:34.909> seconds<00:01:35.299> and<00:01:35.420> coming<00:01:35.750> up

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:35.900 
floor for a few seconds and coming up

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:37.630 
floor for a few seconds and coming up
the<00:01:36.170> difference<00:01:36.350> between<00:01:36.799> this<00:01:36.950> exercise<00:01:37.430> and

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:37.640 
the difference between this exercise and

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.520 
the difference between this exercise and
a<00:01:37.670> normal<00:01:37.970> fly<00:01:38.180> is<00:01:38.240> you're<00:01:38.960> cutting<00:01:39.110> down<00:01:39.409> the

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 
a normal fly is you're cutting down the

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:41.830 
a normal fly is you're cutting down the
momentum<00:01:39.799> but<00:01:40.400> involving<00:01:41.090> your<00:01:41.240> stabilizers

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:41.840 
momentum but involving your stabilizers

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:43.149 
momentum but involving your stabilizers
so<00:01:42.020> making<00:01:42.200> the<00:01:42.409> exercise<00:01:42.830> a<00:01:42.860> little<00:01:43.010> more

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:43.159 
so making the exercise a little more

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:48.060 
so making the exercise a little more
tougher<00:01:43.670> that's<00:01:44.570> it

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.070 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:49.770 

you<00:01:48.550> have<00:01:48.730> to<00:01:48.850> repeat<00:01:49.150> this<00:01:49.330> with<00:01:49.510> the<00:01:49.630> other

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:49.780 
you have to repeat this with the other

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.110 
you have to repeat this with the other
hand<00:01:50.080> if<00:01:50.590> your<00:01:50.950> goal<00:01:51.159> is<00:01:51.190> to<00:01:51.340> increase<00:01:51.729> muscle

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:52.120 
hand if your goal is to increase muscle

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:53.640 
hand if your goal is to increase muscle
mass<00:01:52.270> then<00:01:52.659> take<00:01:52.810> a<00:01:52.840> heavier<00:01:53.200> weight<00:01:53.409> which

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:53.650 
mass then take a heavier weight which

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:54.960 
mass then take a heavier weight which
will<00:01:53.800> give<00:01:53.950> you<00:01:54.070> around<00:01:54.220> eight<00:01:54.580> to<00:01:54.760> ten<00:01:54.940> reps

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:54.970 
will give you around eight to ten reps

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:56.640 
will give you around eight to ten reps
but<00:01:55.510> if<00:01:55.600> you<00:01:55.659> just<00:01:55.840> want<00:01:55.930> to<00:01:56.110> lean<00:01:56.620> down

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:56.650 
but if you just want to lean down

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:58.560 
but if you just want to lean down
