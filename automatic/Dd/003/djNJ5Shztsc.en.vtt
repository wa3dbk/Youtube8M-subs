00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:05.560 
good now the thing that's also
disappointing<00:02:04.579> is<00:02:04.670> that<00:02:04.700> there's<00:02:05.000> only<00:02:05.149> ten

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:05.570 
disappointing is that there's only ten

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:08.590 
disappointing is that there's only ten
tracks<00:02:05.930> on<00:02:06.229> the<00:02:06.350> album<00:02:06.469> and<00:02:07.299> there<00:02:08.299> aren't<00:02:08.570> any

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:08.600 
tracks on the album and there aren't any

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:11.140 
tracks on the album and there aren't any
bonus<00:02:09.110> tracks<00:02:09.410> or<00:02:09.649> anything<00:02:09.860> and<00:02:10.369> it's<00:02:11.000> only

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
bonus tracks or anything and it's only

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.569 
bonus tracks or anything and it's only
about<00:02:11.450> 33<00:02:12.019> minutes<00:02:12.290> in<00:02:12.410> length<00:02:12.560> and<00:02:12.890> that's

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:13.579 
about 33 minutes in length and that's

00:02:13.579 --> 00:02:15.069 
about 33 minutes in length and that's
kind<00:02:13.850> of<00:02:13.910> disappointing<00:02:14.060> to<00:02:14.540> me<00:02:14.630> after

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:15.079 
kind of disappointing to me after

00:02:15.079 --> 00:02:17.520 
kind of disappointing to me after
waiting<00:02:15.680> six<00:02:16.519> years<00:02:16.730> for<00:02:16.970> this<00:02:17.060> new<00:02:17.209> album
