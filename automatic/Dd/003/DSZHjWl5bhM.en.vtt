can do a lot of extra damage to them I

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:21.710 
can do a lot of extra damage to them I
don't<00:00:20.490> think<00:00:20.760> I've<00:00:20.880> upgraded<00:00:21.090> the<00:00:21.390> magnet

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
don't think I've upgraded the magnet

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.509 
don't think I've upgraded the magnet
level<00:00:22.020> 3<00:00:22.439> yet<00:00:23.000> um<00:00:24.000> so<00:00:24.689> there<00:00:24.869> is<00:00:24.990> some

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:25.519 
level 3 yet um so there is some

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:27.769 
level 3 yet um so there is some
persistence<00:00:26.519> between<00:00:26.910> playthroughs<00:00:27.449> and<00:00:27.449> I

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
persistence between playthroughs and I

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.419 
persistence between playthroughs and I
decided<00:00:28.080> to<00:00:28.230> keep<00:00:28.439> that<00:00:28.680> just<00:00:28.859> because<00:00:29.160> it's<00:00:29.369> a

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
decided to keep that just because it's a

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.550 
decided to keep that just because it's a
relatively<00:00:29.820> hard<00:00:30.119> game<00:00:30.300> and<00:00:30.539> one<00:00:31.410> thing<00:00:31.500> I

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
relatively hard game and one thing I

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:32.569 
relatively hard game and one thing I
should<00:00:31.710> talk<00:00:31.830> about<00:00:31.920> before<00:00:32.130> I<00:00:32.250> get<00:00:32.369> into<00:00:32.460> the

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
should talk about before I get into the

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.290 
should talk about before I get into the
guns<00:00:32.850> too<00:00:33.030> much<00:00:33.210> is<00:00:33.390> that<00:00:33.420> this<00:00:34.380> game<00:00:35.180> if<00:00:36.180> you

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
guns too much is that this game if you

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.760 
guns too much is that this game if you
play<00:00:36.450> a<00:00:36.480> lot<00:00:36.630> of<00:00:36.750> shooters<00:00:37.020> you're<00:00:37.559> going<00:00:37.710> to

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
play a lot of shooters you're going to

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.229 
play a lot of shooters you're going to
struggle<00:00:37.980> with<00:00:38.219> it<00:00:38.340> for<00:00:38.550> a<00:00:38.579> bit<00:00:38.640> because

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
struggle with it for a bit because

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.930 
struggle with it for a bit because
there's<00:00:39.600> no<00:00:39.719> regenerating<00:00:40.320> health<00:00:40.350> and<00:00:40.950> i

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
there's no regenerating health and i

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.510 
there's no regenerating health and i
would<00:00:42.719> say<00:00:42.930> anythings<00:00:43.469> are<00:00:43.649> wrong<00:00:43.920> right

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
would say anythings are wrong right

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:45.950 
would say anythings are wrong right
because<00:00:44.969> like<00:00:45.180> normal<00:00:45.480> you<00:00:45.570> can<00:00:45.629> just<00:00:45.809> kind<00:00:45.930> of

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
because like normal you can just kind of

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.389 
because like normal you can just kind of
peek<00:00:46.140> your<00:00:46.230> head<00:00:46.289> out<00:00:46.440> see<00:00:46.739> everybody<00:00:47.070> is<00:00:47.219> in

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
peek your head out see everybody is in

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.369 
peek your head out see everybody is in
the<00:00:47.460> contact<00:00:47.879> behind<00:00:48.149> cover<00:00:48.329> and<00:00:48.690> do<00:00:49.110> fine

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
the contact behind cover and do fine

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.439 
the contact behind cover and do fine
this<00:00:49.829> you<00:00:50.280> have<00:00:50.430> to<00:00:50.520> be<00:00:50.640> a<00:00:50.670> lot<00:00:51.149> more

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
this you have to be a lot more

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.930 
this you have to be a lot more
methodical<00:00:52.289> about<00:00:52.800> how<00:00:53.070> you<00:00:53.129> get<00:00:53.340> through<00:00:53.520> and

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
methodical about how you get through and

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.119 
methodical about how you get through and
health<00:00:54.210> packs<00:00:54.449> only<00:00:54.780> fill<00:00:55.050> up<00:00:55.230> about<00:00:55.949> a<00:00:56.010> third

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
health packs only fill up about a third

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.270 
health packs only fill up about a third
of<00:00:56.579> your<00:00:56.699> health<00:00:56.940> mm-hmm<00:00:57.780> some<00:00:58.469> enemies<00:00:58.859> drop

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
of your health mm-hmm some enemies drop

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.810 
of your health mm-hmm some enemies drop
health<00:00:59.550> packs<00:01:00.500> so<00:01:01.500> it's<00:01:02.129> definitely<00:01:02.489> good<00:01:02.789> to

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
health packs so it's definitely good to

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.000 
health packs so it's definitely good to
kind<00:01:03.149> of<00:01:03.180> look<00:01:03.300> around<00:01:03.449> after<00:01:04.080> a<00:01:04.110> battle<00:01:04.379> see

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
kind of look around after a battle see

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.109 
kind of look around after a battle see
if<00:01:05.070> you<00:01:05.129> can<00:01:05.250> find<00:01:05.369> some<00:01:05.580> extra<00:01:05.729> health<00:01:05.939> back

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
if you can find some extra health back

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.630 
if you can find some extra health back
somewhere<00:01:06.770> and<00:01:07.770> pick<00:01:07.860> up<00:01:07.979> ammo<00:01:08.189> and<00:01:08.430> all<00:01:08.490> that

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
somewhere and pick up ammo and all that

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.380 
somewhere and pick up ammo and all that
stuff<00:01:08.760> but<00:01:10.280> yeah<00:01:11.280> like<00:01:11.640> I<00:01:11.760> can't<00:01:12.030> remember<00:01:12.299> the

stuff but yeah like I can't remember the
last<00:01:12.510> time<00:01:12.689> I<00:01:12.810> played<00:01:13.020> a<00:01:13.740> first-person

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
last time I played a first-person

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.789 
last time I played a first-person
shooter<00:01:14.909> that<00:01:15.119> didn't<00:01:15.540> have<00:01:15.799> regenerating

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
shooter that didn't have regenerating

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.910 
shooter that didn't have regenerating
health<00:01:17.570> yam<00:01:18.570> used<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:18.990> old<00:01:19.170> resistance<00:01:19.680> at

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
health yam used the old resistance at

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.280 
health yam used the old resistance at
least<00:01:20.189> had<00:01:20.430> like<00:01:20.780> quarter<00:01:21.780> of<00:01:21.960> it<00:01:22.140> would

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
least had like quarter of it would

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.149 
least had like quarter of it would
regenerate<00:01:22.619> resistance<00:01:23.430> to<00:01:23.700> was<00:01:24.479> every<00:01:25.439> you

inspirational quote that I kept thinking
to<00:02:50.180> myself<00:02:50.210> while<00:02:50.720> building<00:02:50.960> wikigameguides

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 
to myself while building wikigameguides

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.190 
to myself while building wikigameguides
cuz<00:02:52.100> I<00:02:52.280> mean<00:02:52.700> it's<00:02:52.850> only<00:02:53.000> worth<00:02:53.360> building<00:02:53.690> it

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
cuz I mean it's only worth building it

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:55.690 
cuz I mean it's only worth building it
the<00:02:54.350> way<00:02:54.470> I<00:02:54.500> did<00:02:54.650> build<00:02:55.040> it<00:02:55.220> if<00:02:55.400> people

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
the way I did build it if people

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.090 
the way I did build it if people
actually<00:02:55.970> use<00:02:56.150> it<00:02:56.300> and<00:02:57.020> people<00:02:57.500> are<00:02:57.740> using<00:02:57.920> it

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:58.100 
actually use it and people are using it

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:00.520 
actually use it and people are using it
so<00:02:58.310> I<00:02:58.490> built<00:02:58.820> it<00:02:59.000> and<00:02:59.240> they<00:02:59.840> came<00:03:00.080> they're

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530 
so I built it and they came they're

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:02.080 
so I built it and they came they're
coming<00:03:00.710> they're<00:03:01.040> coming<00:03:01.100> all<00:03:01.490> over<00:03:01.520> our<00:03:01.880> faith

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090
