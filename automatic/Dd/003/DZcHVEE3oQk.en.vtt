00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
trying to feel that intensely as

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.510 
trying to feel that intensely as
possible<00:00:36.540> and<00:00:37.040> who<00:00:38.040> your<00:00:38.190> best<00:00:38.370> to

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
possible and who your best to

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.040 
possible and who your best to
communicate<00:00:38.700> it<00:00:39.120> to<00:00:39.149> the<00:00:39.329> to<00:00:39.629> your<00:00:39.780> audience

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
communicate it to the to your audience

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.920 
communicate it to the to your audience
but<00:00:40.770> if<00:00:40.860> you're<00:00:41.040> not<00:00:41.160> you<00:00:41.850> know<00:00:41.910> prepare<00:00:42.719> agree

but if you're not you know prepare agree

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.680 
but if you're not you know prepare agree
over<00:00:43.440> prepared<00:00:43.950> then<00:00:44.730> you<00:00:44.910> won't<00:00:45.120> be<00:00:45.180> able<00:00:45.420> to

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
over prepared then you won't be able to

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.799 
over prepared then you won't be able to
get<00:00:46.680> inside<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:47.250> music<00:00:47.550> that's<00:00:47.670> fully<00:00:48.000> on

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
took a lot less time so that allowed me

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.510 
took a lot less time so that allowed me
more<00:01:06.930> kind<00:01:07.110> of<00:01:07.140> practice<00:01:07.530> from<00:01:07.680> the<00:01:07.799> age<00:01:07.979> of<00:01:08.159> 11

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
training I didn't eight hours a day of

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.840 
training I didn't eight hours a day of
personal<00:01:13.049> practice<00:01:13.470> every<00:01:14.130> day<00:01:14.159> not

the<00:01:17.869> great<00:01:18.049> thing<00:01:18.079> about<00:01:18.229> the<00:01:18.469> homeschooling

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:18.920 
the great thing about the homeschooling

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.499 
the great thing about the homeschooling
is<00:01:19.100> I<00:01:19.250> still<00:01:19.460> had<00:01:19.579> plenty<00:01:19.759> of<00:01:19.939> time<00:01:20.180> left<00:01:20.329> over

00:01:20.499 --> 00:01:20.509 
is I still had plenty of time left over

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:22.959 
is I still had plenty of time left over
for<00:01:20.810> a<00:01:20.869> social<00:01:21.259> life<00:01:21.430> with<00:01:22.430> even<00:01:22.729> with<00:01:22.850> those

for a social life with even with those
eight<00:01:23.149> hours<00:01:23.450> I<00:01:23.659> guess<00:01:23.810> it's<00:01:23.990> like<00:01:24.140> training

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:24.619 
eight hours I guess it's like training

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:26.649 
eight hours I guess it's like training
for<00:01:24.920> the<00:01:25.009> Olympics<00:01:25.399> or<00:01:25.520> something<00:01:25.579> but<00:01:26.509> ever

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:26.659
