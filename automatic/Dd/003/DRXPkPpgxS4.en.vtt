until it starts crashing and it looks
sort<00:03:19.290> of<00:03:19.349> simple<00:03:19.709> it<00:03:20.190> actually<00:03:20.489> gets

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:20.579 
sort of simple it actually gets

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:23.629 
sort of simple it actually gets
challenging<00:03:21.120> as<00:03:21.349> you<00:03:22.349> can<00:03:22.500> see<00:03:22.620> i<00:03:22.650> felt<00:03:23.129> so

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:23.639 
challenging as you can see i felt so

00:03:23.639 --> 00:03:26.330 
challenging as you can see i felt so
since<00:03:23.819> I<00:03:23.940> fell<00:03:24.530> it<00:03:25.530> puts<00:03:25.769> a<00:03:25.829> little<00:03:25.980> tombstone

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
since I fell it puts a little tombstone

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.520 
since I fell it puts a little tombstone
down<00:03:26.760> there<00:03:26.940> if<00:03:27.150> my<00:03:27.419> camera<00:03:27.840> will<00:03:28.019> be<00:03:28.169> a<00:03:28.199> dull

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
down there if my camera will be a dull

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.949 
down there if my camera will be a dull
and<00:03:28.769> focus<00:03:29.159> puts<00:03:29.909> a<00:03:30.030> little<00:03:30.180> tombstone<00:03:30.510> down

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
and focus puts a little tombstone down

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:33.830 
and focus puts a little tombstone down
there<00:03:31.139> just<00:03:31.620> kind<00:03:31.799> of<00:03:31.889> cool<00:03:32.040> so<00:03:33.030> that's<00:03:33.239> there

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
there just kind of cool so that's there

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.830 
there just kind of cool so that's there
