00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:19.910
Hey it’s Kristen with Collision Hub and
we’re here at SEMA 2014.

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:24.180
Now if you’re like a lot of us we all invasion
our self as fabricators.

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.680
But if you’re like me you struggle with
it.

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:30.609
And plasma cutting is one of the things that
have kind of helped change fabs.

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:34.210
JoAnn I wanted to stop by and learn a lot
about plasmas so I’m hoping you’re going

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:35.640
to help me out on that.

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.370
One of the neat things about Hypertherm all
they do is plasma they’ve been doing plasma

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:41.660
for over 40 years now.

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:45.910
One of the things I struggled with and you
mentioned to me earlier is with the early

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:50.530
days of fab plasma it seemed like I was working
harder to fix it just going the traditional

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:54.960
way with a lot of clean up and you kind of
felt the same way until you met them what

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.220
was going on then?

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:00.700
Back in the mid 80’s I used to work for
a fabrication company and I was doing wielding

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:05.320
all kinds of fabrication and one day I was
put on the plasma cutter and it was the worst

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:06.909
two days of my life.

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:11.790
It was loud it was noisy; messy there were
sparks everywhere.

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.250
And then to make matters worse you would cut
the parts then you would have to go back and

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:18.810
debrer everything.

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.810
And you know time is money.

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.940
And so once they took me off the plasma cutter
I never wanted to use plasma again.

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:30.100
But now you got a chance to meet with Hypertherm
and that kind of changed your mind.

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.960
What changed your mind about plasma and using
it in fabrication?

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:39.799
SEMA show 2012 going by the Hypertherm booth
and tried out one of the machines.

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:41.409
And I really didn’t think I was going to
like it.

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:44.159
I mean I was already bias against plasma.

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:49.200
I walked up and picked up the torch and of
the cool things about the power max machines

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.259
is that you can drag the torch tip directly
on the metal.

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:59.530
There are not many machines you can do that
with so it just makes it really nice and easy

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:00.530
to get a smooth cut.

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:05.490
And that’s what I did I walked up put on
the gloves the glasses and I started drawing

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.009
flame shapes on the metal.

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:15.400
I drew a flame shape then I picked up the
sheet the cut out just feel nice and clean

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:21.900
still there on the table and I was just blown
away I was like this is plasma?

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:27.769
It’s much quieter much less sparks and the
edges are so clean.

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:31.109
Well we know what all you can do from the
motorcycles that you’re fabing up to the

00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:35.340
car you had here last year and that amazing
run you had on motor city masters.

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.650
So I think fabrication advice and cutting
advice from you is some of the best we can

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:39.650
have.

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:41.960
So if you’re interested in learning more
about plasma and the cutters.

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:45.559
And what they can do for fab in your shop
or just for fun on those weekend builds visit

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:49.809
Hypertherm and get information about there
line and you may be a convert just like JoAnn

00:02:49.809 --> 00:02:49.849
was.
