there

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:40.709 

wheels<00:02:40.150> are<00:02:40.299> turning

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:40.719 
wheels are turning

00:02:40.719 --> 00:02:45.629 
wheels are turning
now<00:02:41.340> the<00:02:42.340> lasagna<00:02:43.120> a<00:02:43.420> motor<00:02:44.109> driving<00:02:44.950> one

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:45.639 
now the lasagna a motor driving one

00:02:45.639 --> 00:02:49.589 
now the lasagna a motor driving one
bogey<00:02:46.230> so<00:02:47.760> part<00:02:48.760> of<00:02:48.939> the<00:02:49.090> cleaning<00:02:49.419> mechanism

00:02:49.589 --> 00:02:49.599 
bogey so part of the cleaning mechanism

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:53.970 
bogey so part of the cleaning mechanism
is<00:02:50.290> to<00:02:50.530> slide<00:02:51.359> the<00:02:52.359> rolling<00:02:52.659> stop<00:02:52.989> backwards

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
is to slide the rolling stop backwards

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:57.920 
is to slide the rolling stop backwards
and<00:02:54.069> forwards<00:02:55.349> so<00:02:56.349> that<00:02:56.560> the<00:02:57.010> driven<00:02:57.280> wheels

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
and forwards so that the driven wheels

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.780 
and forwards so that the driven wheels
are<00:02:58.930> being<00:02:59.260> cleaned<00:02:59.500> by<00:02:59.799> rotation<00:03:00.549> by<00:03:00.730> the

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
are being cleaned by rotation by the

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:03.149 
are being cleaned by rotation by the
other<00:03:01.030> wheels<00:03:01.239> are<00:03:01.540> being<00:03:01.719> cleaned<00:03:02.010> simply<00:03:03.010> by

00:03:03.149 --> 00:03:03.159 
other wheels are being cleaned simply by

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:04.979 
other wheels are being cleaned simply by
rolling<00:03:03.639> backwards<00:03:04.000> and<00:03:04.120> forwards<00:03:04.480> on<00:03:04.659> a

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:04.989 
rolling backwards and forwards on a

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:12.240 
rolling backwards and forwards on a
cleaning<00:03:05.349> pad<00:03:09.510> now<00:03:10.510> I<00:03:10.859> think<00:03:11.859> the<00:03:11.949> driven

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250 
cleaning pad now I think the driven

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:14.189 
cleaning pad now I think the driven
wheels<00:03:12.430> are<00:03:12.909> coming<00:03:13.329> cleaner<00:03:13.750> because<00:03:14.079> they

00:03:14.189 --> 00:03:14.199 
wheels are coming cleaner because they

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:16.500 
wheels are coming cleaner because they
have<00:03:14.290> been<00:03:14.409> spun<00:03:14.709> the<00:03:15.370> problem<00:03:15.790> is<00:03:15.939> that<00:03:16.389> the

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
have been spun the problem is that the

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:19.409 
have been spun the problem is that the
heavy<00:03:16.689> dirt<00:03:16.959> buildup<00:03:17.409> on<00:03:17.530> the<00:03:18.419> non-written

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:19.419 
heavy dirt buildup on the non-written

00:03:19.419 --> 00:03:30.370 
heavy dirt buildup on the non-written
wheels<00:03:20.370> which<00:03:21.370> is

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:30.380 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:44.770 

means<00:03:31.190> that<00:03:31.400> it's<00:03:31.640> taking<00:03:41.140> slowly<00:03:43.660> so<00:03:44.660> it's

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:44.780 
means that it's taking slowly so it's

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:48.850 
means that it's taking slowly so it's
not<00:03:45.020> a<00:03:45.290> shortcut<00:03:45.800> cleaning<00:03:46.490> the<00:03:46.550> wheels<00:03:47.860> our

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:48.860 
not a shortcut cleaning the wheels our

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:52.150 
not a shortcut cleaning the wheels our
pound<00:03:49.130> bins<00:03:49.370> compare<00:03:49.790> that<00:03:50.860> because<00:03:51.860> effect

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:52.160 
pound bins compare that because effect

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:53.620 
pound bins compare that because effect
I'm<00:03:52.370> just<00:03:52.550> rubbing<00:03:52.760> your<00:03:52.910> wheels<00:03:53.120> up<00:03:53.330> and<00:03:53.480> down

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:53.630 
I'm just rubbing your wheels up and down

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:54.940 
I'm just rubbing your wheels up and down
across<00:03:53.930> a<00:03:54.020> clean

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:54.950 
across a clean

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:56.860 
across a clean
that's<00:03:55.400> the<00:03:55.670> these<00:03:56.120> are<00:03:56.300> the<00:03:56.390> non<00:03:56.570> driven

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:56.870 
that's the these are the non driven

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:00.160 
that's the these are the non driven
wheels<00:03:58.030> these<00:03:59.030> ones<00:03:59.330> that's<00:03:59.660> fine<00:03:59.750> they're

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:00.170 
wheels these ones that's fine they're

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:02.830 
wheels these ones that's fine they're
being<00:04:00.320> turned<00:04:00.530> around<00:04:01.060> I<00:04:02.060> don't<00:04:02.540> think<00:04:02.720> that's

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:02.840 
being turned around I don't think that's

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:05.140 
being turned around I don't think that's
going<00:04:03.020> to<00:04:03.080> be<00:04:03.230> any<00:04:03.320> quicker<00:04:03.560> and<00:04:03.980> easier<00:04:04.150> than

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:05.150 
going to be any quicker and easier than

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:09.340 
going to be any quicker and easier than
using<00:04:05.840> any<00:04:06.680> other<00:04:06.860> cleaning<00:04:07.820> device<00:04:08.480> against

the<00:04:09.410> wheels<00:04:09.590> from<00:04:09.800> just<00:04:10.040> turning<00:04:10.340> the<00:04:10.430> wheels

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:11.200 
the wheels from just turning the wheels

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:14.440 
the wheels from just turning the wheels
we'll<00:04:12.200> try<00:04:12.470> it<00:04:13.150> okay

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:14.450 
we'll try it okay

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:21.970 
we'll try it okay
verdict<00:04:16.000> if<00:04:17.000> you've<00:04:17.870> got<00:04:18.880> one<00:04:19.880> of<00:04:20.000> these<00:04:20.980> I

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:21.980 
verdict if you've got one of these I

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:23.470 
verdict if you've got one of these I
would<00:04:22.550> say<00:04:22.730> stick<00:04:22.970> with<00:04:23.000> this

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:23.480 
would say stick with this

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:28.780 
would say stick with this
that's<00:04:23.960> the<00:04:24.200> wire<00:04:24.440> brush<00:04:25.480> for<00:04:27.190> the<00:04:28.190> job<00:04:28.400> I<00:04:28.550> had

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:28.790 
that's the wire brush for the job I had

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:35.530 
that's the wire brush for the job I had
which<00:04:29.150> was<00:04:29.300> a<00:04:31.690> coke<00:04:32.690> Co<00:04:33.460> engine<00:04:34.460> an<00:04:35.300> engine

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:35.540 
which was a coke Co engine an engine

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:38.050 
which was a coke Co engine an engine
where<00:04:36.020> only<00:04:36.380> one<00:04:36.710> of<00:04:36.830> the<00:04:36.920> bogus<00:04:37.310> was<00:04:37.550> driven

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:38.060 
where only one of the bogus was driven

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:40.840 
where only one of the bogus was driven
but<00:04:38.960> the<00:04:39.260> other<00:04:39.740> bogie<00:04:40.220> was<00:04:40.370> required<00:04:40.730> for

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:40.850 
but the other bogie was required for

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:42.610 
but the other bogie was required for
pickup<00:04:41.240> and<00:04:41.480> therefore<00:04:41.930> it's<00:04:42.050> too<00:04:42.230> long<00:04:42.440> to

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:42.620 
pickup and therefore it's too long to

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:45.850 
pickup and therefore it's too long to
fit<00:04:42.770> on<00:04:42.950> to<00:04:43.070> that<00:04:43.270> then<00:04:44.270> the<00:04:44.870> answer<00:04:45.200> is<00:04:45.380> this

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:45.860 
fit on to that then the answer is this

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:49.180 
fit on to that then the answer is this
fiberglass<00:04:46.460> pencil<00:04:47.680> I've<00:04:48.680> just<00:04:48.890> cleaned<00:04:49.100> the
