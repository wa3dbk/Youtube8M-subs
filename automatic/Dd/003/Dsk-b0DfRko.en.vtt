00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:19.750 
can manage to get it on there it will

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:23.520 
can manage to get it on there it will
make<00:01:20.080> the<00:01:20.380> general<00:01:22.290> process<00:01:23.290> a<00:01:23.320> little

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:23.530 
make the general process a little

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.150 
make the general process a little
smoother<00:01:24.840> so<00:01:25.840> go<00:01:26.020> ahead<00:01:26.350> and<00:01:26.530> kind<00:01:26.680> of<00:01:26.800> plan

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:27.160 
smoother so go ahead and kind of plan

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:29.370 
smoother so go ahead and kind of plan
out<00:01:27.340> how<00:01:27.640> you're<00:01:27.940> going<00:01:28.150> to<00:01:28.240> be<00:01:28.690> splitting<00:01:29.080> up

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:29.380 
out how you're going to be splitting up

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.060 
out how you're going to be splitting up
the<00:01:29.440> lip<00:01:29.920> cream<00:01:30.220> I'm<00:01:31.090> making<00:01:31.570> a<00:01:31.690> five<00:01:32.020> star<00:01:32.440> you

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:33.070 
the lip cream I'm making a five star you

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:34.770 
the lip cream I'm making a five star you
can<00:01:33.310> try<00:01:33.580> to<00:01:33.640> make<00:01:33.850> a<00:01:33.880> eight<00:01:34.180> star<00:01:34.480> if<00:01:34.570> you'd

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:34.780 
can try to make a eight star if you'd

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:37.620 
can try to make a eight star if you'd
like<00:01:34.990> but<00:01:35.380> it's<00:01:35.710> really<00:01:36.130> difficult<00:01:36.460> I<00:01:37.030> find

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:37.630 
like but it's really difficult I find

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.040 
like but it's really difficult I find
found<00:01:38.110> to<00:01:38.560> even<00:01:39.010> make<00:01:39.130> a<00:01:39.190> five<00:01:39.490> star<00:01:39.870> mostly<00:01:40.870> al

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:41.050 
found to even make a five star mostly al

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:45.330 
found to even make a five star mostly al
if<00:01:41.320> I<00:01:41.470> don't<00:01:42.840> watch<00:01:43.840> correctly<00:01:44.770> I<00:01:45.010> will

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:45.340 
if I don't watch correctly I will

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:47.790 
if I don't watch correctly I will
usually<00:01:45.640> end<00:01:46.060> up<00:01:46.240> with<00:01:46.300> something<00:01:46.900> like<00:01:47.530> a

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:47.800 
usually end up with something like a

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:51.390 
usually end up with something like a
four<00:01:48.220> star<00:01:48.550> or<00:01:48.850> even<00:01:48.880> a<00:01:49.270> three<00:01:49.510> star<00:01:50.340> so<00:01:51.340> you

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:51.400 
four star or even a three star so you

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.490 
four star or even a three star so you
have<00:01:51.670> to<00:01:51.880> make<00:01:52.030> your<00:01:52.300> indents<00:01:52.750> accordingly

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:53.500 
have to make your indents accordingly

00:01:53.500 --> 00:02:01.430 
have to make your indents accordingly
and<00:01:54.010> kind<00:01:54.580> of<00:01:54.780> divide<00:01:55.780> that<00:01:56.050> pretty<00:01:56.650> evenly

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:01.440 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.190 

looks<00:02:02.440> like<00:02:02.650> this<00:02:02.860> one<00:02:03.100> would<00:02:03.430> be<00:02:03.700> a<00:02:03.729> six<00:02:04.659> star

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200 
looks like this one would be a six star

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.660 
looks like this one would be a six star
and<00:02:06.120> what<00:02:07.120> I<00:02:07.150> mean<00:02:07.360> by<00:02:07.420> star<00:02:07.900> is<00:02:08.200> the<00:02:08.670> icing

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
and what I mean by star is the icing

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:12.600 
and what I mean by star is the icing
tips<00:02:09.940> that<00:02:10.300> would<00:02:10.450> normally<00:02:10.629> squeeze<00:02:11.610> real

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
tips that would normally squeeze real

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:18.809 
tips that would normally squeeze real
icing<00:02:14.459> have<00:02:15.459> five<00:02:16.209> star<00:02:16.599> point<00:02:17.080> tips<00:02:17.379> or<00:02:17.819> eight

00:02:18.809 --> 00:02:18.819 
icing have five star point tips or eight

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:23.309 
icing have five star point tips or eight
star<00:02:19.180> point<00:02:19.450> tips<00:02:19.659> so<00:02:20.819> this<00:02:21.819> would<00:02:22.239> be<00:02:22.540> a<00:02:22.569> six

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:23.319 
star point tips so this would be a six

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:27.660 
star point tips so this would be a six
star<00:02:24.659> as<00:02:25.659> you<00:02:25.840> can<00:02:26.019> see<00:02:26.200> I've<00:02:26.319> made<00:02:26.370> all<00:02:27.370> the

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
star as you can see I've made all the

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.870 
star as you can see I've made all the
indents<00:02:28.060> and<00:02:28.360> I'm<00:02:28.510> going<00:02:28.780> to<00:02:28.959> start<00:02:29.819> kind<00:02:30.819> of

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880 
indents and I'm going to start kind of

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.930 
indents and I'm going to start kind of
pushing<00:02:31.330> into<00:02:31.600> the<00:02:31.720> middle<00:02:32.050> and

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
pushing into the middle and

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:41.480 
pushing into the middle and
taking<00:02:33.180> those<00:02:33.390> and<00:02:33.660> then<00:02:33.840> it's<00:02:34.050> more<00:02:34.260> visible

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:41.490 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:46.070 

so<00:02:42.240> when<00:02:42.870> you<00:02:43.640> have<00:02:44.640> that<00:02:44.910> you<00:02:45.240> can<00:02:45.270> start<00:02:45.840> kind

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
so when you have that you can start kind

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:57.790 
so when you have that you can start kind
of<00:02:46.140> pushing<00:02:46.560> up<00:02:46.740> the<00:02:47.870> top

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:57.800 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.550 

to<00:02:58.430> imitate<00:02:58.730> and<00:02:59.390> you<00:02:59.510> can<00:02:59.660> just<00:02:59.810> kind<00:03:00.020> of<00:03:00.140> pull

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
to imitate and you can just kind of pull

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:04.120 
to imitate and you can just kind of pull
on<00:03:00.590> it<00:03:00.860> really<00:03:01.010> gently<00:03:01.930> to<00:03:02.930> imitate<00:03:03.590> a<00:03:03.860> real

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.130 
on it really gently to imitate a real

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:10.780 
on it really gently to imitate a real
icing<00:03:04.460> finish<00:03:09.310> that's<00:03:10.310> something<00:03:10.610> that's

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790 
icing finish that's something that's

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:15.130 
icing finish that's something that's
really<00:03:10.880> difficult<00:03:11.510> to<00:03:11.660> get<00:03:11.810> so<00:03:13.690> I'm<00:03:14.690> going<00:03:14.960> to

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:15.140 
really difficult to get so I'm going to

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:45.199 
really difficult to get so I'm going to
define<00:03:15.500> this<00:03:15.980> a<00:03:16.040> little<00:03:16.370> bit<00:03:16.640> more

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:48.050 

and<00:03:45.810> as<00:03:46.140> you<00:03:46.260> can<00:03:46.439> see<00:03:46.739> the<00:03:47.099> bottom<00:03:47.879> is

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
and as you can see the bottom is

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:51.580 
and as you can see the bottom is
predefined<00:03:48.689> but<00:03:49.019> if<00:03:49.170> you<00:03:49.439> went<00:03:49.769> while<00:03:50.129> you

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:51.590 
predefined but if you went while you

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:54.470 
predefined but if you went while you
have<00:03:52.590> the<00:03:52.980> defined<00:03:53.340> bottom<00:03:53.640> the<00:03:53.819> top<00:03:54.030> is<00:03:54.269> not

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
have the defined bottom the top is not

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:57.319 
have the defined bottom the top is not
as<00:03:55.469> defined<00:03:56.069> so<00:03:56.280> I'm<00:03:56.400> going<00:03:56.670> to<00:03:56.819> go<00:03:56.939> ahead<00:03:57.000> and

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:57.329 
as defined so I'm going to go ahead and

00:03:57.329 --> 00:04:02.839 
as defined so I'm going to go ahead and
pave<00:03:58.140> the<00:03:58.170> top<00:03:58.680> a<00:03:58.709> little<00:03:58.950> bit<00:03:59.219> more<00:04:01.819> so<00:04:02.819> that

00:04:02.839 --> 00:04:02.849 
pave the top a little bit more so that

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:06.559 
pave the top a little bit more so that
we<00:04:03.030> just<00:04:03.420> straight<00:04:03.900> to<00:04:04.319> that<00:04:04.349> little<00:04:05.450> point<00:04:06.450> on

00:04:06.559 --> 00:04:06.569 
we just straight to that little point on

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:14.209 
we just straight to that little point on
the<00:04:06.750> top<00:04:12.139> of<00:04:13.139> course<00:04:13.379> this<00:04:13.620> doesn't<00:04:13.889> have<00:04:14.159> to

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:14.219 
the top of course this doesn't have to

00:04:14.219 --> 00:04:21.999 
the top of course this doesn't have to
be<00:04:14.400> perfect<00:04:14.819> because<00:04:14.969> it's<00:04:15.329> a<00:04:15.450> little<00:04:15.750> detail

00:04:21.999 --> 00:04:22.009 

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:24.589 

so<00:04:23.009> this<00:04:23.280> is<00:04:23.490> the<00:04:23.699> whip<00:04:23.849> cream<00:04:24.150> that<00:04:24.389> will

00:04:24.589 --> 00:04:24.599 
so this is the whip cream that will

00:04:24.599 --> 00:04:28.879 
so this is the whip cream that will
result<00:04:25.050> and<00:04:25.500> if<00:04:26.250> you<00:04:26.639> this<00:04:27.300> is<00:04:27.650> pushing<00:04:28.650> it

00:04:28.879 --> 00:04:28.889 
result and if you this is pushing it

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:31.070 
result and if you this is pushing it
straight<00:04:29.070> up<00:04:29.490> but<00:04:29.970> as<00:04:30.210> you<00:04:30.449> can<00:04:30.570> see<00:04:30.630> on<00:04:30.870> this

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:31.080 
straight up but as you can see on this

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:34.969 
straight up but as you can see on this
one<00:04:31.320> I've<00:04:31.949> kind<00:04:32.400> of<00:04:33.289> indented<00:04:34.289> it<00:04:34.410> to<00:04:34.590> the<00:04:34.710> side

00:04:34.969 --> 00:04:34.979 
one I've kind of indented it to the side

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:38.240 
one I've kind of indented it to the side
like<00:04:35.009> this<00:04:35.280> in<00:04:35.970> a<00:04:36.090> twist<00:04:36.419> and<00:04:36.930> that<00:04:37.250> will

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:38.250 
like this in a twist and that will

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:40.730 
like this in a twist and that will
result<00:04:38.430> in<00:04:38.759> a<00:04:38.880> more<00:04:39.180> realistic<00:04:39.449> whipped<00:04:40.410> cream

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:40.740 
result in a more realistic whipped cream

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:42.740 
result in a more realistic whipped cream
dollop<00:04:41.130> but<00:04:41.520> of<00:04:41.729> course<00:04:42.120> you<00:04:42.240> can<00:04:42.479> definitely

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:42.750 
dollop but of course you can definitely

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:46.480 
dollop but of course you can definitely
do<00:04:43.199> this<00:04:43.259> as<00:04:43.650> well<00:04:43.889> and<00:04:44.690> to<00:04:45.690> finish<00:04:46.050> it<00:04:46.199> off

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:46.490 
do this as well and to finish it off

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:52.820 
do this as well and to finish it off
going<00:04:47.490> to<00:04:49.940> make<00:04:50.940> a<00:04:51.180> zig-zag<00:04:51.690> pattern<00:04:51.990> with<00:04:52.710> the

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:52.830 
going to make a zig-zag pattern with the

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:55.820 
going to make a zig-zag pattern with the
tip<00:04:53.039> if<00:04:53.760> you<00:04:54.000> used<00:04:54.270> an<00:04:54.479> icing<00:04:54.870> tip<00:04:55.110> then<00:04:55.590> you

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:55.830 
tip if you used an icing tip then you

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:59.899 
tip if you used an icing tip then you
would<00:04:56.010> normally<00:04:56.490> have<00:04:56.699> a<00:04:57.380> zigzag<00:04:58.380> 'add<00:04:58.909> design

00:04:59.899 --> 00:04:59.909 
would normally have a zigzag 'add design

00:04:59.909 --> 00:05:03.830 
would normally have a zigzag 'add design
if<00:05:00.330> you<00:05:00.389> know<00:05:00.960> what<00:05:01.080> I'm<00:05:01.169> talking<00:05:01.500> about<00:05:02.840> so

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:03.840 
if you know what I'm talking about so

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:05.510 
if you know what I'm talking about so
I'm<00:05:03.930> going<00:05:04.139> to<00:05:04.260> try<00:05:04.409> to<00:05:04.440> imitate<00:05:04.919> that<00:05:04.949> by

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:05.520 
I'm going to try to imitate that by

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:10.360 
I'm going to try to imitate that by
taking<00:05:06.330> these<00:05:06.630> individual<00:05:07.820> little<00:05:08.820> parts<00:05:09.240> and

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:10.370 
taking these individual little parts and

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:12.649 
taking these individual little parts and
putting<00:05:11.370> applying<00:05:12.150> a<00:05:12.240> little<00:05:12.419> bit<00:05:12.539> of

00:05:12.649 --> 00:05:12.659 
putting applying a little bit of

00:05:12.659 --> 00:05:18.250 
putting applying a little bit of
pressure

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:18.260 

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:24.630 

and<00:05:18.710> gently<00:05:19.510> squeezing<00:05:20.510> them<00:05:20.810> so<00:05:21.200> that

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:24.640 

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:29.410 

they'll<00:05:25.640> have<00:05:25.820> a<00:05:26.030> sharper<00:05:26.540> finish<00:05:28.330> so<00:05:29.330> of

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:29.420 
they'll have a sharper finish so of

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:31.510 
they'll have a sharper finish so of
course<00:05:29.660> I<00:05:29.840> didn't<00:05:30.200> take<00:05:30.440> my<00:05:30.620> time<00:05:30.890> as<00:05:31.160> much<00:05:31.340> on

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:31.520 
course I didn't take my time as much on

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:34.000 
course I didn't take my time as much on
this<00:05:31.670> one<00:05:31.940> so<00:05:32.780> it<00:05:32.870> doesn't<00:05:32.900> look<00:05:33.290> as<00:05:33.470> nice<00:05:33.650> as

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:34.010 
this one so it doesn't look as nice as

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:36.190 
this one so it doesn't look as nice as
the<00:05:34.490> other<00:05:34.520> ones<00:05:35.000> that<00:05:35.120> I've<00:05:35.270> made<00:05:35.510> but<00:05:36.020> you

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:36.200 
the other ones that I've made but you

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:38.170 
the other ones that I've made but you
can<00:05:36.380> kind<00:05:36.590> of<00:05:36.650> definitely<00:05:37.070> see<00:05:37.430> the<00:05:37.640> outline

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:38.180 
can kind of definitely see the outline

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:40.080 
can kind of definitely see the outline
starting<00:05:39.140> to<00:05:39.260> take<00:05:39.470> shape

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:40.090 
starting to take shape

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:44.620 
starting to take shape
