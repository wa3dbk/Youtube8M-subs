 seal it with translucent powder after 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.690

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.850
 with a flat brush to illuminate the 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.379
 bone of the eyebrows and blur this tone 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.320

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:01.920
 eyelid later I will take a shadow 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:06.000

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.720
 fold intensifying the color and as 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.630
 you can see the orange color that we put 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:30.119
 previously it helps us a lot to be 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:33.360
 lose tonality after I'm going to take 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:35.490
