00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:16.190 
waste our energy we have to strike as
soon<00:02:11.090> as<00:02:11.209> the<00:02:11.299> cocoon<00:02:11.660> opens

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:28.590 

looks<00:02:17.200> like<00:02:17.440> Zoey's<00:02:17.830> late<00:02:18.070> as<00:02:18.250> usual<00:02:27.600> I'm

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:28.600 
looks like Zoey's late as usual I'm

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.360 
looks like Zoey's late as usual I'm
starting<00:02:29.170> to<00:02:29.200> think<00:02:29.290> that<00:02:29.590> cocoons<00:02:30.160> a

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
starting to think that cocoons a

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:32.730 
starting to think that cocoons a
diversion<00:02:31.000> according<00:02:31.960> to<00:02:32.050> the<00:02:32.170> readouts<00:02:32.560> I'm

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:32.740 
diversion according to the readouts I'm

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:33.960 
diversion according to the readouts I'm
getting<00:02:33.010> from<00:02:33.220> many<00:02:33.460> of<00:02:33.580> you<00:02:33.700> there<00:02:33.910> are

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
getting from many of you there are

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:35.790 
getting from many of you there are
several<00:02:34.270> Preta<00:02:34.630> sites<00:02:34.900> deep<00:02:35.230> underneath<00:02:35.650> the

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:35.800 
several Preta sites deep underneath the

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.800 
several Preta sites deep underneath the
tower<00:02:36.010> I<00:02:36.400> think<00:02:37.000> they're<00:02:37.180> digging<00:02:37.600> for

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
tower I think they're digging for

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:41.070 
tower I think they're digging for
something<00:02:38.010> like<00:02:39.010> blue<00:02:39.370> aqua<00:02:39.940> that<00:02:40.450> cocoons<00:02:40.900> a

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
something like blue aqua that cocoons a

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:42.600 
something like blue aqua that cocoons a
threat<00:02:41.380> for<00:02:41.560> sure<00:02:41.800> but<00:02:42.070> if<00:02:42.190> those<00:02:42.310> Cinna

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
threat for sure but if those Cinna

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:44.460 
threat for sure but if those Cinna
clones<00:02:42.910> get<00:02:43.150> their<00:02:43.330> hands<00:02:43.720> on<00:02:43.810> blue<00:02:44.110> aqua

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
clones get their hands on blue aqua

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:47.610 
clones get their hands on blue aqua
