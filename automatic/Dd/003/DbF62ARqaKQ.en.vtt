it's<00:00:46.260> the<00:00:46.469> estimation<00:00:47.600> investigation<00:00:48.629> let's

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
it's the estimation investigation let's

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.319 
it's the estimation investigation let's
estimate<00:00:49.800> how<00:00:50.039> many<00:00:50.100> balls<00:00:50.550> are<00:00:50.850> in<00:00:51.120> this

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
estimate how many balls are in this

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.410 
estimate how many balls are in this
estimation<00:00:51.989> jar<00:00:52.399> first<00:00:53.399> look<00:00:54.000> at<00:00:54.149> the<00:00:54.210> balls

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
estimation jar first look at the balls

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.020 
estimation jar first look at the balls
in<00:00:54.660> the<00:00:54.750> jar<00:00:54.780> really<00:00:55.289> carefully<00:00:56.129> look<00:00:56.760> at<00:00:56.850> them

make your best estimate open the jar and

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.440 
make your best estimate open the jar and
count<00:01:06.060> out<00:01:06.240> ten<00:01:06.600> balls<00:01:07.610> hold<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:08.790> balls<00:01:08.970> or

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
count out ten balls hold the balls or

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.300 
count out ten balls hold the balls or
just<00:01:09.750> make<00:01:09.930> a<00:01:09.960> little<00:01:10.170> pile<00:01:10.530> in<00:01:10.799> front<00:01:11.070> of<00:01:11.159> you

just make a little pile in front of you

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.670 
just make a little pile in front of you
take<00:01:12.000> a<00:01:12.060> good<00:01:12.360> look<00:01:12.420> at<00:01:12.780> what<00:01:12.960> a<00:01:12.990> group<00:01:13.229> of<00:01:13.350> ten

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
take a good look at what a group of ten

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.520 
take a good look at what a group of ten
balls<00:01:13.979> looks<00:01:14.340> like<00:01:14.689> okay<00:01:15.689> put<00:01:16.080> them<00:01:16.140> back<00:01:16.320> in

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
balls looks like okay put them back in

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.010 
balls looks like okay put them back in
the<00:01:16.619> jar<00:01:16.650> with<00:01:17.040> the<00:01:17.159> rest<00:01:17.340> of<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:17.580> ball<00:01:18.020> now

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
what estimations you made SID let's take

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:28.550 
what estimations you made SID let's take
a<00:02:26.860> look<00:02:27.070> at<00:02:27.160> your<00:02:27.280> journal<00:02:27.550> first<00:02:27.880> I'm<00:02:28.150> sure

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
a look at your journal first I'm sure

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.770 
a look at your journal first I'm sure
let's<00:02:29.560> see<00:02:29.680> first<00:02:30.010> I<00:02:30.370> counted<00:02:30.940> out<00:02:31.300> 10

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
let's see first I counted out 10

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.410 
let's see first I counted out 10
seashells<00:02:32.470> so<00:02:33.040> I<00:02:33.250> knew<00:02:33.610> I<00:02:33.640> had<00:02:33.940> more<00:02:34.150> than<00:02:34.209> that

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
seashells so I knew I had more than that

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:35.520 
seashells so I knew I had more than that
in<00:02:34.720> the<00:02:34.810> jar<00:02:35.050> huh

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
in the jar huh

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:39.660 
in the jar huh
then<00:02:36.010> I<00:02:36.750> estimated<00:02:37.750> there<00:02:38.200> were<00:02:38.230> 22<00:02:39.190> shells

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
then I estimated there were 22 shells

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:42.990 
then I estimated there were 22 shells
and<00:02:40.090> when<00:02:40.900> I<00:02:40.930> counted<00:02:41.410> them<00:02:41.590> I<00:02:41.860> found<00:02:42.640> out

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
and when I counted them I found out

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.090 
and when I counted them I found out
there<00:02:43.540> were<00:02:43.750> 28<00:02:44.350> shells

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:45.100 
there were 28 shells

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:47.730 
there were 28 shells
oh<00:02:45.220> that's<00:02:45.940> a<00:02:46.090> lot<00:02:46.300> of<00:02:46.330> shells<00:02:46.660> and<00:02:46.930> when<00:02:47.560> I<00:02:47.590> get

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:47.740 
oh that's a lot of shells and when I get

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:50.400 
oh that's a lot of shells and when I get
home<00:02:47.920> I'm<00:02:48.490> gonna<00:02:48.820> estimate<00:02:49.060> how<00:02:49.720> many<00:02:49.780> shells

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
home I'm gonna estimate how many shells

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:53.520 
home I'm gonna estimate how many shells
I<00:02:50.709> have<00:02:50.980> in<00:02:51.190> my<00:02:51.400> whole<00:02:51.820> bucket<00:02:52.480> oh<00:02:52.600> great<00:02:53.170> work

little bit more than that my jar so I
estimated<00:03:09.130> fifteen<00:03:09.940> rocks<00:03:10.420> and<00:03:10.780> when<00:03:11.230> I

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
estimated fifteen rocks and when I

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.199 
estimated fifteen rocks and when I
counted<00:03:11.680> them<00:03:11.830> out<00:03:11.920> there<00:03:12.519> were<00:03:12.670> sixteen

at<00:03:41.890> estimating<00:03:42.069> I<00:03:42.819> think<00:03:43.810> it's<00:03:44.140> time<00:03:44.530> to<00:03:44.590> be<00:03:45.459> a

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:45.489 
at estimating I think it's time to be a

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:54.140 
at estimating I think it's time to be a
with<00:03:45.910> all<00:03:46.030> your<00:03:46.300> new<00:03:46.599> estimation<00:03:47.470> skills

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:57.479
