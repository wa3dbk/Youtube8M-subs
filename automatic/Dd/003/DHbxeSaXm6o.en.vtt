00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
take a chance on it let's go ahead and

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.440 
take a chance on it let's go ahead and

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
put a couple more coats and and then we

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:22.490 
put a couple more coats and and then we
definitely<00:01:21.810> are<00:01:21.869> going<00:01:21.990> to<00:01:22.049> reduce<00:01:22.290> it<00:01:22.470> a

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
definitely are going to reduce it a

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.140 
definitely are going to reduce it a
little<00:01:22.619> more<00:01:22.799> this<00:01:23.009> time<00:01:23.189> and<00:01:23.430> spray<00:01:23.700> faster

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150

some ended up with some filler up there
and<00:01:43.770> had<00:01:43.860> to<00:01:43.950> sand<00:01:44.220> that<00:01:44.340> off<00:01:44.520> just<00:01:45.000> you<00:01:45.299> know

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
and had to sand that off just you know

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.840 
and had to sand that off just you know
from<00:01:45.689> the<00:01:45.990> swap<00:01:46.380> marks<00:01:46.799> catching<00:01:47.430> it<00:01:47.520> up<00:01:47.640> there

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
from the swap marks catching it up there

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.770 
from the swap marks catching it up there
and<00:01:48.560> so<00:01:49.560> yesterday<00:01:49.979> when<00:01:50.100> we<00:01:50.280> primed<00:01:50.579> I<00:01:50.909> took

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
and so yesterday when we primed I took

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.359 
and so yesterday when we primed I took
the<00:01:52.020> tape<00:01:52.229> the<00:01:52.439> paper<00:01:52.680> and<00:01:53.009> laid<00:01:53.159> it<00:01:53.280> up

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
the tape the paper and laid it up

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.249 
the tape the paper and laid it up
against<00:01:53.729> the<00:01:53.790> bat<00:01:53.970> tape<00:01:54.270> and<00:01:54.540> then<00:01:54.630> you<00:01:55.140> know

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
against the bat tape and then you know

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:56.899 
against the bat tape and then you know
kind<00:01:55.470> of<00:01:55.530> folded<00:01:55.829> it<00:01:55.979> down<00:01:56.130> and<00:01:56.340> it<00:01:56.399> created<00:01:56.729> a

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
kind of folded it down and it created a

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.060 
kind of folded it down and it created a
pretty<00:01:57.180> sharp<00:01:57.570> crease<00:01:58.469> and<00:01:58.680> left<00:01:58.860> a<00:01:58.950> little

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
pretty sharp crease and left a little

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.249 
pretty sharp crease and left a little
bit<00:01:59.219> of<00:01:59.340> a<00:01:59.430> more<00:02:00.390> of<00:02:00.450> a<00:02:00.509> hard<00:02:00.719> line<00:02:00.930> there<00:02:01.110> that

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
bit of a more of a hard line there that

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.830 
bit of a more of a hard line there that
I<00:02:01.290> wanted<00:02:01.619> so<00:02:01.829> get<00:02:02.520> this<00:02:02.759> deal<00:02:03.479> going<00:02:03.810> here

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
I wanted so get this deal going here

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.490 
I wanted so get this deal going here
hopefully<00:02:04.290> that<00:02:04.439> allow<00:02:04.680> some

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:06.500 
hopefully that allow some

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:07.630 
hopefully that allow some
primer<00:02:06.740> to<00:02:06.920> blow<00:02:07.100> up<00:02:07.280> under<00:02:07.490> there<00:02:07.580> and

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 
primer to blow up under there and

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.560 
primer to blow up under there and
feather<00:02:07.970> out<00:02:09.280> so<00:02:10.280> i<00:02:10.789> think<00:02:11.060> i've<00:02:11.300> seen<00:02:11.330> some

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:53.360 
that we had to use so rather than mix up

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:58.300 
that we had to use so rather than mix up
and<00:02:53.600> have<00:02:54.080> to<00:02:55.570> dirty<00:02:56.570> up<00:02:56.690> a<00:02:56.900> spray<00:02:57.140> gun<00:02:57.310> for

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:00.860 
that I'll just mix it up a tiny amount

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:02.500 
that I'll just mix it up a tiny amount
in<00:03:01.220> there<00:03:01.640> and<00:03:01.790> use<00:03:01.910> the<00:03:02.030> brush<00:03:02.239> and<00:03:02.450> just

guys<00:03:04.820> do<00:03:05.000> that<00:03:05.150> also<00:03:05.300> all<00:03:06.200> right<00:03:06.320> we'll<00:03:06.530> show

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
guys do that also all right we'll show

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:09.670 
guys do that also all right we'll show
you<00:03:06.680> more<00:03:06.830> later<00:03:07.840> all<00:03:08.840> right<00:03:09.020> all<00:03:09.200> primer<00:03:09.560> it

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 
you more later all right all primer it

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.729 
you more later all right all primer it
up<00:03:09.800> and<00:03:10.120> get<00:03:11.120> the<00:03:11.239> trunk<00:03:11.480> lid<00:03:11.690> off<00:03:12.680> and

00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:12.739 
up and get the trunk lid off and

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:16.990 
up and get the trunk lid off and
starting<00:03:13.610> to<00:03:13.730> get<00:03:14.120> get<00:03:14.510> it<00:03:14.630> prepped<00:03:15.850> got<00:03:16.850> some

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000 
starting to get get it prepped got some

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.780 
starting to get get it prepped got some
primer<00:03:17.830> overspray<00:03:18.830> on<00:03:18.860> the<00:03:19.130> corners<00:03:19.459> and<00:03:19.700> I'm

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:19.790 
primer overspray on the corners and I'm

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:22.300 
primer overspray on the corners and I'm
assuming<00:03:20.209> that<00:03:20.390> all<00:03:20.860> that's<00:03:21.860> got<00:03:22.040> to<00:03:22.130> come<00:03:22.250> off

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.310 
assuming that all that's got to come off

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:25.630 
assuming that all that's got to come off
because<00:03:22.940> underneath<00:03:23.360> that<00:03:23.570> is<00:03:24.640> unstuffed

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:25.640 
because underneath that is unstuffed

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:29.580 
because underneath that is unstuffed
ecoute<00:03:26.120> so<00:03:26.450> I'm<00:03:26.660> guessing<00:03:26.900> that's<00:03:27.140> a<00:03:27.970> just<00:03:28.970> a

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
ecoute so I'm guessing that's a just a

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:32.979 
ecoute so I'm guessing that's a just a
delamination<00:03:31.180> issue<00:03:32.180> waiting<00:03:32.660> to<00:03:32.720> happen

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:32.989 
delamination issue waiting to happen

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:35.530 
delamination issue waiting to happen
there<00:03:33.170> so<00:03:33.500> we'll<00:03:33.650> work<00:03:33.799> on<00:03:33.980> that<00:03:34.010> and<00:03:34.400> I<00:03:35.360> got

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:35.540 
there so we'll work on that and I got

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:42.340 
there so we'll work on that and I got
the<00:03:35.630> trunk<00:03:35.810> jams<00:03:37.239> in<00:03:38.239> 400<00:03:38.810> so<00:03:40.959> got<00:03:41.959> that<00:03:42.140> done

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:42.350 
the trunk jams in 400 so got that done

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:44.410 
the trunk jams in 400 so got that done
we'll<00:03:42.829> get<00:03:42.980> this<00:03:43.100> done<00:03:43.160> tomorrow<00:03:44.030> night<00:03:44.299> we'll

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:44.420 
we'll get this done tomorrow night we'll
