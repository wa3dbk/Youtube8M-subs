00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
is actually expandable meaning that it

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.450 
is actually expandable meaning that it
has<00:01:48.450> this<00:01:48.689> buttons<00:01:49.229> here<00:01:49.590> that<00:01:49.829> you<00:01:50.280> can

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
has this buttons here that you can

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.060 
has this buttons here that you can
actually<00:01:50.850> detach<00:01:51.210> so<00:01:51.570> that<00:01:52.049> you<00:01:52.229> know<00:01:52.380> it<00:01:52.799> can

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
actually detach so that you know it can

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.850 
actually detach so that you know it can
make<00:01:53.310> it<00:01:53.579> wider<00:01:54.119> at<00:01:54.450> the<00:01:54.479> top<00:01:54.600> portion<00:01:55.110> it's

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
make it wider at the top portion it's

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.560 
make it wider at the top portion it's
actually<00:01:56.369> right<00:01:56.549> down<00:01:56.579> here<00:01:57.000> and<00:01:57.270> it<00:01:57.420> gets

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
actually right down here and it gets

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.410 
actually right down here and it gets
narrower<00:01:58.200> at<00:01:58.500> the<00:01:58.530> top<00:01:58.649> so<00:01:59.520> if<00:01:59.729> you<00:01:59.820> guys<00:02:00.000> have

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
narrower at the top so if you guys have

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.859 
narrower at the top so if you guys have
more<00:02:00.689> things<00:02:00.869> to<00:02:01.140> put<00:02:01.380> so<00:02:01.979> you<00:02:02.040> may<00:02:02.280> consider

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:02.869 
more things to put so you may consider

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:06.889 
more things to put so you may consider
opening<00:02:03.869> or<00:02:04.020> detaching<00:02:04.829> the<00:02:05.399> buttons<00:02:06.119> at<00:02:06.509> both

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
opening or detaching the buttons at both

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:28.620 
I think it's not common or not usual

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:31.610 
I think it's not common or not usual
because<00:04:28.800> usually<00:04:29.160> the<00:04:29.790> interior<00:04:30.330> for<00:04:30.510> a<00:04:30.750> Tamia

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:31.620 
because usually the interior for a Tamia

a Beltran is being raped

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:37.130 
a Beltran is being raped
so<00:04:34.170> I<00:04:34.590> actually<00:04:34.920> asked<00:04:35.250> my<00:04:35.370> ass<00:04:35.640> a<00:04:35.910> and<00:04:36.810> wonder

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:37.140 
so I actually asked my ass a and wonder

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:39.170 
so I actually asked my ass a and wonder
whether<00:04:37.320> will<00:04:37.620> they<00:04:37.770> come<00:04:37.980> up<00:04:38.130> with<00:04:38.310> the

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:39.180 
whether will they come up with the

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:41.450 
whether will they come up with the
second<00:04:39.870> version<00:04:40.050> of<00:04:40.320> it<00:04:40.440> consistent<00:04:41.130> with<00:04:41.190> the

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:41.460 
second version of it consistent with the

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:44.750 
second version of it consistent with the
red<00:04:41.700> lining<00:04:41.970> but<00:04:42.870> I<00:04:42.930> guess<00:04:43.590> the<00:04:43.860> answer<00:04:44.310> was<00:04:44.490> no

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:44.760 
red lining but I guess the answer was no

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:47.120 
red lining but I guess the answer was no
I<00:04:44.790> mean<00:04:45.060> she<00:04:45.240> was<00:04:45.420> unsure<00:04:45.600> but<00:04:46.320> I<00:04:46.350> felt<00:04:47.040> that

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:47.130 
I mean she was unsure but I felt that

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:49.370 
I mean she was unsure but I felt that
the<00:04:47.790> challenges<00:04:48.270> of<00:04:48.510> it<00:04:48.660> being<00:04:48.930> a<00:04:49.110> red

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:49.380 
the challenges of it being a red

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:52.040 
the challenges of it being a red
interior<00:04:49.890> is<00:04:50.190> very<00:04:50.460> very<00:04:50.760> scheme<00:04:51.120> so<00:04:51.510> I<00:04:51.810> could

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:52.050 
interior is very very scheme so I could

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:54.530 
interior is very very scheme so I could
really<00:04:52.260> put<00:04:52.530> a<00:04:52.710> lot<00:04:52.740> of<00:04:53.010> things<00:04:53.250> inside<00:04:53.970> me<00:04:54.300> bag

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:56.970 
but you have to be very careful because

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:59.420 
but you have to be very careful because
of<00:04:57.390> the<00:04:57.480> light<00:04:57.990> interior<00:04:58.410> color<00:04:58.890> for<00:04:59.400> example

don't<00:05:09.660> want<00:05:10.050> to<00:05:10.140> worry<00:05:10.380> that<00:05:10.500> portion<00:05:11.010> so<00:05:11.220> much

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:11.460 
don't want to worry that portion so much

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:14.360 
don't want to worry that portion so much
but<00:05:11.850> if<00:05:12.210> you<00:05:12.480> guys<00:05:12.690> are<00:05:13.200> those<00:05:13.410> type<00:05:13.800> that<00:05:14.040> just

but if you guys are those type that just

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:16.460 
but if you guys are those type that just
you<00:05:14.580> know<00:05:14.610> get<00:05:15.390> your<00:05:15.540> stuff<00:05:15.810> and<00:05:15.840> throw<00:05:16.290> it<00:05:16.350> to
