00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.530
 I studied human rights in Amsterdam 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:48.680

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:49.930
 freshmen 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:52.060

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:17.459
 so poker tour 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:20.779
 I would lie if I say that poker is not a different midfielder 

00:02:20.779 --> 00:02:21.710
 and this is crazy 

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:23.790
 the 27 year old boy from Haarlem 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.229
 poker sporadically visits the internet several times a week 

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:30.279
 you can you can just really 

00:02:30.279 --> 00:02:33.599
 well being balkenende that appeals to me very much 

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:37.239
 send also I see also see some perspective 

00:02:39.089 --> 00:02:41.069
 of the week I have them 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:44.069
 with the necessary effort with the proceeds simply on the internet 

00:02:44.749 --> 00:02:47.749
 our spheres as 15 114 

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:51.649
 but the kid for something brought away is four hundred on his parents 

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:56.599
 well done this week a little less so the week before 

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:58.469
 what me 

00:02:58.469 --> 00:02:59.679
 this is mine made 

00:02:59.679 --> 00:03:01.149
 i play true 

00:03:01.149 --> 00:03:04.149
 in per week 

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:07.929
 yes you have to be ten I think online 

00:03:07.929 --> 00:03:09.709
 so one is not sure 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:12.709
 that's a 10 21 taken from the good 

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:17.289
 they can't do that so much 

00:03:17.289 --> 00:03:20.289
 it must make 

00:03:26.889 --> 00:03:28.069
 the Friday 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:31.519
 that and the n va last week no longer understood 

00:03:32.149 --> 00:03:34.579
 there I go 

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:37.579
 where is the location brought the poll the dog is being held 

00:03:38.589 --> 00:03:41.159
 the place where the vvd should be 

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:44.159
 proof falcon worth 

00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:47.459
 more 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:49.739
 it is always recorded there 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:52.369
 you used to get your own work out 

00:03:52.369 --> 00:03:55.369
 In the past there were also six months ago 

00:03:57.079 --> 00:03:58.329
 the whole week 

00:03:58.329 --> 00:04:00.799
 mainly came to the government on Friday 

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:03.799
 where is it sometimes bothering 

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:08.599
 when they get a bit off 

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:11.489
 eighty percent of their time and I think this one 

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:14.279
 also for further investigation 

00:04:14.279 --> 00:04:18.239
 then think that no one up there seriously intends to be with him 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:19.709
 to 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:22.249
 only stay open longer 

00:04:22.249 --> 00:04:25.279
 and they make money that is earned 

00:04:25.279 --> 00:04:27.669
 and that has been a conscious choice 

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:30.749
 for that matter says a lot on monday if you check the 

00:04:30.749 --> 00:04:32.499
 the sixteen hours a day 

00:04:32.499 --> 00:04:34.650
 that means you 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:37.650
 this because he is busy with poker after the hefty de is a bit exaggerated 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:42.940
 Bakers and an incredible amount of quality that is always with me at the moment 

00:04:43.719 --> 00:04:47.569
 And yes I have to admit the ball is easy to talk to staff that aren't that much 

00:04:47.569 --> 00:04:49.639
 There are days when I do 

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:54.270
 However, the traces might be at a state of the day poker order early 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:58.199
 in the evening in the Amsterdam area, I can handle the poker tournament 

00:04:59.059 --> 00:05:02.289
 We are wanted both the casinos that will be present 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:04.599
 to portray 

00:05:04.599 --> 00:05:06.650
 can stimulate 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:09.710
 all things are stolen so can be nothing 

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:17.120
 the 

00:05:22.319 --> 00:05:25.749
 it no longer does itself poppins 

00:05:25.749 --> 00:05:29.619
 those who enjoy playing poker without coercion 

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:34.960
 so it's cozy it's cozy that's something of it 

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:35.909
 the fact that 

00:05:35.909 --> 00:05:37.680
 the police move 

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:39.729
 the first is placed 

00:05:39.729 --> 00:05:41.949
 stupid 

00:05:41.949 --> 00:05:47.050
 I mean that if you go with this sort of thing you often go to the local hallway 

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:48.020
 avoid or 

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:50.379
 on a role play 

00:05:50.379 --> 00:05:54.169
 that is what most people continue to do because it is a man through terribly hard 

00:05:54.169 --> 00:05:56.059
 thief dealt with professionally 

00:05:56.059 --> 00:06:00.019
 and now therefore basically lost control over agreeing 

00:06:00.019 --> 00:06:00.179
 the holes
