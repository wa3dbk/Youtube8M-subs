00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
we're going to start our machine again

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.290 
we're going to start our machine again
and<00:00:44.329> basically<00:00:45.329> all<00:00:45.510> I<00:00:45.539> do<00:00:45.690> is<00:00:46.110> I<00:00:46.379> take<00:00:46.620> a

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
it's one of the few machines that will

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.300 
it's one of the few machines that will
juice<00:01:06.360> wheatgrass<00:01:06.390> or<00:01:07.229> brought<00:01:07.530> any<00:01:07.740> graphics

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
juice wheatgrass or brought any graphics

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.219 
juice wheatgrass or brought any graphics
very<00:01:08.520> well<00:01:08.820> you<00:01:09.360> can<00:01:09.540> hear<00:01:09.659> it<00:01:09.810> kind<00:01:09.930> of<00:01:10.049> made<00:01:10.200> a

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
very well you can hear it kind of made a

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.630 
very well you can hear it kind of made a
bit<00:01:10.409> of<00:01:10.500> squeaky<00:01:10.950> noise<00:01:11.130> when<00:01:11.369> it<00:01:11.460> went

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
bit of squeaky noise when it went

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.399 
bit of squeaky noise when it went
through<00:01:11.820> there<00:01:12.030> and<00:01:12.390> that's<00:01:12.630> just<00:01:12.720> typical

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
through there and that's just typical

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.469 
through there and that's just typical
what<00:01:13.979> happens<00:01:14.310> when<00:01:14.490> you<00:01:14.610> when<00:01:15.060> you<00:01:15.180> put<00:01:15.360> the

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
what happens when you when you put the

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.539 
what happens when you when you put the
wheatgrass<00:01:15.810> through<00:01:16.229> there<00:01:16.470> another<00:01:17.130> handful

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
wheatgrass through there another handful

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
of wheatgrass if that started in there

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.580 
of wheatgrass if that started in there
you<00:01:21.390> can<00:01:21.540> hear<00:01:21.689> it<00:01:21.810> squeaking<00:01:22.259> as<00:01:22.409> it's

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
you can hear it squeaking as it's

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.770 
you can hear it squeaking as it's
pulling<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:23.580> grass<00:01:23.820> down<00:01:24.210> in<00:01:24.450> there<00:01:24.659> and

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
pulling the grass down in there and

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.600 
pulling the grass down in there and
working<00:01:25.140> on<00:01:25.290> it<00:01:26.960> put<00:01:27.960> another<00:01:28.200> handful<00:01:28.740> in<00:01:28.979> it

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
working on it put another handful in it

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.310 
working on it put another handful in it
see<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:29.970> juice<00:01:30.210> coming<00:01:30.240> out<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:30.810> bottom<00:01:30.960> and

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
see the juice coming out the bottom and

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.590 
see the juice coming out the bottom and
you<00:01:31.979> can<00:01:32.130> see<00:01:32.310> what<00:01:32.490> I'm<00:01:32.579> getting<00:01:32.729> down<00:01:33.180> to<00:01:33.479> the

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
you can see what I'm getting down to the

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:34.190 
you can see what I'm getting down to the
end<00:01:33.810> of<00:01:33.930> this

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
end of this

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.980 
end of this
we're<00:01:35.100> a<00:01:35.130> shop<00:01:35.520> that<00:01:35.549> basically<00:01:36.210> commend<00:01:36.719> a

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
few inches so out of a tree like this

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.399 
few inches so out of a tree like this
I'd<00:01:39.840> probably<00:01:39.869> get<00:01:40.439> one<00:01:40.979> two<00:01:41.310> three<00:01:42.060> four<00:01:42.780> five

price five kilograms it's probably

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:00.690 
price five kilograms it's probably
enough<00:02:58.630> to<00:02:58.780> make<00:02:58.960> oh<00:02:59.290> I<00:03:00.130> don't<00:03:00.370> know<00:03:00.550> I'm<00:03:00.670> just

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
enough to make oh I don't know I'm just

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.210 
enough to make oh I don't know I'm just
got<00:03:01.150> a<00:03:01.180> guess<00:03:01.570> here<00:03:01.840> twenty<00:03:02.380> to<00:03:02.500> thirty<00:03:02.830> trace

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
got a guess here twenty to thirty trace

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:05.730 
got a guess here twenty to thirty trace
probably<00:03:04.210> easily<00:03:04.630> out<00:03:04.810> of<00:03:04.840> that<00:03:05.080> maybe<00:03:05.440> even

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:05.740 
probably easily out of that maybe even

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:08.910 
probably easily out of that maybe even
more<00:03:05.980> so<00:03:06.850> it's<00:03:06.970> quite<00:03:07.150> economical<00:03:07.560> not<00:03:08.560> cents

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920 
more so it's quite economical not cents

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.460 
more so it's quite economical not cents
and<00:03:09.720> so<00:03:10.720> I'm<00:03:10.780> just<00:03:10.960> gonna<00:03:11.050> do<00:03:11.170> the<00:03:11.260> same<00:03:11.290> thing
