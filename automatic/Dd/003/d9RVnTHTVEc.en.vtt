00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.630 
um but overall still you know really
really<00:02:18.330> good<00:02:18.540> screen<00:02:18.990> as<00:02:19.230> would<00:02:20.100> be<00:02:20.250> the<00:02:20.430> thing

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
really good screen as would be the thing

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.940 
really good screen as would be the thing
that<00:02:20.700> I<00:02:20.850> would<00:02:20.970> emphasize<00:02:21.440> about<00:02:22.440> this<00:02:22.650> phone

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
that I would emphasize about this phone

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.230 
that I would emphasize about this phone
if<00:02:23.190> you're<00:02:23.310> looking<00:02:23.580> for<00:02:23.610> a<00:02:23.820> really<00:02:24.060> good

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:24.240 
if you're looking for a really good

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.630 
if you're looking for a really good
screen<00:02:24.600> for<00:02:24.870> watching<00:02:25.200> videos<00:02:25.530> this<00:02:26.400> would

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
screen for watching videos this would

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.960 
screen for watching videos this would
definitely<00:02:26.790> be<00:02:27.240> a<00:02:27.270> way<00:02:27.510> to<00:02:27.540> go<00:02:27.800> um<00:02:28.820> the<00:02:29.820> other

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
definitely be a way to go um the other

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.440 
definitely be a way to go um the other
thing<00:02:30.300> that<00:02:30.330> I<00:02:30.540> noticed<00:02:31.050> is<00:02:31.350> that<00:02:31.410> the<00:02:31.830> the

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
thing that I noticed is that the the

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:36.430 
thing that I noticed is that the the
sound<00:02:33.450> on<00:02:33.690> this<00:02:33.810> phone<00:02:34.110> is<00:02:34.470> really<00:02:34.860> good<00:02:35.130> um

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 
sound on this phone is really good um

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.080 
sound on this phone is really good um
it's<00:02:37.440> probably<00:02:37.950> the<00:02:38.280> best<00:02:38.310> I've<00:02:38.700> heard<00:02:38.940> on<00:02:39.060> a

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
it's probably the best I've heard on a

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:44.060 
it's probably the best I've heard on a
phone<00:02:40.970> taking<00:02:41.970> into<00:02:42.120> consideration<00:02:42.150> the<00:02:43.070> HTC

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.070 
phone taking into consideration the HTC

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:45.560 
phone taking into consideration the HTC
One<00:02:44.340> would<00:02:44.580> probably<00:02:44.940> the<00:02:45.000> only<00:02:45.090> thing<00:02:45.390> that's

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.570 
One would probably the only thing that's

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:47.210 
One would probably the only thing that's
right<00:02:45.780> up<00:02:45.900> there<00:02:46.110> with<00:02:46.260> it<00:02:46.440> just<00:02:46.650> in<00:02:46.800> terms<00:02:46.950> of

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
right up there with it just in terms of

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.620 
right up there with it just in terms of
sound<00:02:47.720> and<00:02:48.720> playing<00:02:49.110> music<00:02:50.030> goes<00:02:51.030> really<00:02:51.420> loud

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
sound and playing music goes really loud

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:54.950 
sound and playing music goes really loud
really<00:02:51.930> good<00:02:52.200> sound<00:02:53.570> I'll<00:02:54.570> give<00:02:54.720> you<00:02:54.780> an<00:02:54.870> idea

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:54.960 
really good sound I'll give you an idea

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:56.360 
really good sound I'll give you an idea
obviously<00:02:55.350> it's<00:02:55.800> not<00:02:55.980> going<00:02:56.130> to<00:02:56.220> work

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
obviously it's not going to work

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.940 
obviously it's not going to work
perfectly<00:02:56.430> but<00:02:57.240> it'll<00:02:58.140> just<00:02:58.380> kind<00:02:58.620> of<00:02:58.710> show

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
perfectly but it'll just kind of show

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.810 
perfectly but it'll just kind of show
you<00:02:58.980> what<00:02:59.340> it<00:02:59.490> what<00:03:00.300> it<00:03:00.330> sounds<00:03:00.750> like<00:03:01.220> you<00:03:02.220> can

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820 
you what it what it sounds like you can

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:06.050 
you what it what it sounds like you can
just<00:03:02.850> kind<00:03:03.150> of<00:03:03.180> hear<00:03:03.360> how<00:03:03.510> loud<00:03:03.750> it<00:03:03.930> goes<00:03:05.060> I'm

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
just kind of hear how loud it goes I'm

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.270 
just kind of hear how loud it goes I'm
recording<00:03:06.510> with<00:03:06.990> a<00:03:07.020> camera<00:03:07.290> that<00:03:07.500> has<00:03:07.800> full

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
recording with a camera that has full

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:38.880 
recording with a camera that has full
stereo<00:03:08.610> sound<00:03:09.140> so<00:03:10.520> it'll<00:03:11.520> give<00:03:11.640> you<00:03:11.730> an<00:03:11.850> idea

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:38.890 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:42.610 

so<00:03:39.890> the<00:03:40.100> sound<00:03:40.280> is<00:03:40.490> really<00:03:40.730> great<00:03:41.060> on<00:03:41.330> it<00:03:41.620> it

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620 
so the sound is really great on it it

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:44.530 
so the sound is really great on it it
does<00:03:42.860> take<00:03:43.130> a<00:03:43.160> sim<00:03:43.430> card<00:03:43.490> which<00:03:44.120> is<00:03:44.300> another

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 
does take a sim card which is another

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:47.830 
does take a sim card which is another
advantage<00:03:45.730> the<00:03:46.730> disadvantage<00:03:47.300> is<00:03:47.450> you're<00:03:47.750> not

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:47.840 
advantage the disadvantage is you're not

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:49.990 
advantage the disadvantage is you're not
going<00:03:48.020> to<00:03:48.080> get<00:03:48.230> 4G<00:03:48.710> LTE<00:03:48.950> unless<00:03:49.550> you<00:03:49.700> have<00:03:49.850> your

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.000 
going to get 4G LTE unless you have your

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.420 
going to get 4G LTE unless you have your
sim<00:03:50.210> card<00:03:50.450> in<00:03:50.570> the<00:03:51.500> biggest<00:03:51.770> advantage<00:03:52.220> is<00:03:52.370> you

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:52.430 
sim card in the biggest advantage is you

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:54.490 
sim card in the biggest advantage is you
can<00:03:52.730> take<00:03:52.910> this<00:03:53.090> overseas<00:03:53.720> versus<00:03:54.350> the<00:03:54.470> other

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:54.500 
can take this overseas versus the other

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:57.340 
can take this overseas versus the other
cdma<00:03:55.160> phones<00:03:55.640> offered<00:03:56.630> through<00:03:56.810> sprint<00:03:57.140> you

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:57.350 
cdma phones offered through sprint you

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:01.810 
cdma phones offered through sprint you
cannot<00:03:58.300> so<00:03:59.300> keep<00:03:59.480> that<00:03:59.510> in<00:03:59.660> mind<00:04:00.460> the<00:04:01.460> reasons

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:01.820 
cannot so keep that in mind the reasons

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:03.400 
cannot so keep that in mind the reasons
why<00:04:02.030> I<00:04:02.060> would<00:04:02.360> buy<00:04:02.510> this<00:04:02.570> phone<00:04:02.960> is<00:04:03.170> if<00:04:03.320> I

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:03.410 
why I would buy this phone is if I

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:06.700 
why I would buy this phone is if I

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:49.490 
apps or widgets built into the phone so

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:50.740 
apps or widgets built into the phone so
you<00:04:49.520> kind<00:04:49.760> of<00:04:49.790> have<00:04:49.850> to<00:04:49.970> download<00:04:50.270> your<00:04:50.570> own
