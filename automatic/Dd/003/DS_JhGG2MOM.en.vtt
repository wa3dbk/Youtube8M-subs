first<00:00:22.500> time<00:00:22.830> in<00:00:23.010> three<00:00:23.160> or<00:00:23.250> four<00:00:23.310> seasons<00:00:23.850> so

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
first time in three or four seasons so

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.150 
first time in three or four seasons so
there's<00:00:24.510> lots<00:00:24.720> and<00:00:25.019> lots<00:00:25.260> of<00:00:25.439> changes<00:00:25.740> the

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
that we expected so there is a chance
