00:00:04.509 --> 00:00:09.410
 Hi, welcome to the picture today, let's go. 

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:12.290
 keep talking about system 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:14.809
 respiratory system in one 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:17.590
 we have already seen that the breath is 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:20.599
 related to gas exchange 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:24.019
 mainly oxygen inlet and 

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:28.099
 and there we saw 

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:31.640
 two special types of breathing 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:34.040
 cutaneous and branchial respiration in class 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:36.530
 today we will see two more types 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:39.380
 The third type of breathing is 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:42.620
 tracheal breathing that is found 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:46.250
 especially in insects that are 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:48.470
 within the edge of arthropods already draws 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:49.970
 that a cricket for us to analyze this 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:53.810
 type of breathing 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:58.460
 good the tracheal breathing as the own 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:01:01.820
 name says occurs through trachea the 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:05.059
 tracheae are tube systems that 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:06.320
 has direct contact with the environment 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:09.490
 outdoor 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:14.030
 and this system of tubes will be 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:17.810
 branching until reaching the cells and 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:21.170
 there is an opening that communicates and 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:24.530
 system of tubes with the external medium 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:28.369
 these openings are called spira 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:29.210
 and allow the entry and exit of 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:32.780
 gases 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:35.560
 then during the breathing process the 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:40.130
 oxygen that is here in the environment 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:44.299
 enters through the kuhn spira and kayak 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:47.679
 this system of tubes that oxygen will 

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:52.549
 being transported until arriving 

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:57.380
 directly in the cells much attention 

00:01:52.549 --> 00:02:01.749
 the oxygen reaches the cell directly 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:05.479
 In this case the respiratory system is 

00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:08.390
 independent of the circulatory system 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:11.690
 you must remember that arthropods 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:14.000
 has an open circulation and this 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:17.870
 type of circulatory system is not very 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:21.230
 efficient because the hemolymph circulates 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:24.730
 under low pressure it circulates very slowly 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:29.150
 so it is interesting that cells 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:32.360
 I directly receive this oxygen that 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:35.329
 arrives here through the trachea and 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:37.819
 doing the opposite process the gas 

00:02:35.329 --> 00:02:40.569
 carbon dioxide that has emerged 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:44.629
 metabolism of the cell will be 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:45.709
 transported out into the environment 

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:48.019
 environment 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:51.859
 then here is the tracheal breath 

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:56.239
 mainly found in insects and 

00:02:51.859 --> 00:03:00.079
 to close the last type of breath is 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:03.799
 pulmonary respiration that is our 

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:07.750
 and beyond the color of the data as 

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:10.909
 the mammalian reptile children and the birds 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:14.390
 other organisms such as 

00:03:10.909 --> 00:03:18.530
 molluscs also perform the 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:22.750
 pulmonary respiration and when this occurs 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:25.250
 kind of good breathing these organisms 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:29.540
 there are lungs 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:32.750
 the lungs are air pockets that stay 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:35.569
 located inside the body of the animal 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:38.660
 in which case a process 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:41.900
 we call pulmonary ventilation that 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:45.280
 allows entry and exit of air and 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:49.959
 that occurs during the process of 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:53.090
 oxygen enters here through the 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:56.629
 trachea goes through the bronchi 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:57.799
 bronchitis light until it reaches the alveolus 

00:03:56.629 --> 00:04:01.069
 pulmonary 

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:04.280
 this region of the pulmonary 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:08.150
 is here in the lung is rich in pots 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:11.269
 and blood in these blood vessels is 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:15.709
 What will happen gas exchange the 

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:19.220
 oxygen will be diffused to them and 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:23.030
 blood will be transported to the other 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:26.630
 body cells observe that in this case 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:30.050
 the respiratory system and the circulatory system 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:32.300
 are very related and doing here 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:35.060
 the reverse path the charge gas 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:37.729
 the only one comes through these vessels 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:40.360
 blood and this carbon dioxide will 

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:44.150
 pass through the pulmonary alveoli 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:47.990
 Here we go the other way 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:51.500
 reach the external environment being eliminated 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:55.310
 by the breathing process then the 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:58.900
 personal during inspiration happens 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:05:02.539
 oxygen intake and with inspiration 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:05.090
 the exit of carbon dioxide occurs and only 

00:05:02.539 --> 00:05:09.259
 to remember here this process happens 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:12.289
 on both sides of the lung on the right side 

00:05:09.259 --> 00:05:15.590
 and on the left side we end here 

00:05:12.289 --> 00:05:16.159
 with the respiratory system and in the next 

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:17.949
 class 

00:05:16.159 --> 00:05:22.180
 Let's talk about the excretory system 

00:05:17.949 --> 00:05:22.180
 good studies until then
