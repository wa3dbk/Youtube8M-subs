00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:05.470
 hello welcome to this 

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:08.800
 create a black and white esic image in different ways to color a 

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:11.670
 photoshop image with which I will use this time we can get very 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.259
 good results 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.369
 we press against the j to duplicate lehman 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:17.679
 the famous coat 

00:00:17.679 --> 00:00:19.519
 new adjustment layer 

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:22.519
 and there we will take transatlantic 

00:00:24.819 --> 00:00:27.819
 and enable the colony box 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:30.810
 for juste let's choose 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.420
 the tone of the skin 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.320
 the tatio since at any time we can adjust the color giving double 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:37.380
 click 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.120
 grandson of the adjustment layer 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.590
 as we will see a campus 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:41.910
 stream of this tutorial 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.270
 for now let's leave those values 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:47.550
 juan abente saturation 33 luminosidad -3 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.120
 about the previous preparation 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.490
 kyl and now we go the image 

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:57.290
 your 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:58.710
 to invest 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.840
 pizarro that we have the white color summoned the frontal 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.200
 since it's important because white paints 

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:07.630
 and the black radilla 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:10.790
 we take a suitable brush the client does not want to give color 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:13.760
 in that way 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.070
 about the whole part 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:16.570
 where do you end 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:17.800
 face 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.220
 holman towers 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:20.650
 look at the video 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:23.540
 so it does not get too heavy but 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:25.640
 tell you that 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:26.790
 be very careful with 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.100
 well 11 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.220
 the hair be careful and do not paint 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.220
 using a suitable type according to the area where it goes 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:42.080
 and so we would go to complete the whole area of ​​the beach 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.010
 for the color as I said then you can anytime modify 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.930
 that merely indicative 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:17.619
 you have to be careful with the paint 

00:02:17.619 --> 00:02:19.749
 with a beautiful goal 

00:02:19.749 --> 00:02:22.749
 intraocular does not reach my way either 

00:02:30.469 --> 00:02:32.729
 they always fall wrong ipod and cheers 

00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:36.929
 I would only have to invert the white color for black and we will be very well 

00:02:36.929 --> 00:02:39.929
 later they found it 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:50.459
 and eating for what 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:53.079
 the employer pimec the right one for aquino 

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:56.079
 your mission 

00:03:02.359 --> 00:03:05.669
 the blessed land that to create chlorine we take the black color impacted 

00:03:05.669 --> 00:03:08.669
 we would run where we did not see in 

00:03:37.219 --> 00:03:39.509
 and everything for him 

00:03:39.509 --> 00:03:42.509
 those who do not 

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:48.549
 and we're going for a new layer of just 

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:52.119
 tony saturation 

00:03:52.119 --> 00:03:53.110
 or what 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:55.729
 I'm able to color 

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:58.729
 and take a tone that I used to give the hair a new color 

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:04.319
 we put the following parliament 

00:04:05.919 --> 00:04:08.619
 17 39 +8 

00:04:08.619 --> 00:04:12.519
 has been a very good layer so saturation image 

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:13.689
 settings 

00:04:13.689 --> 00:04:16.689
 to invest 

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:20.329
 and we can start 

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:23.279
 to paint with a suitable brush 

00:04:23.279 --> 00:04:26.279
 with the color we have chosen for the hair 

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:30.129
 and again accelerated the live and this time you have to go very carefully 

00:04:30.129 --> 00:04:34.460
 of not leaving the area of ​​hair condom every moment dye the right 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:37.490
 reducing by increasing the size of said interest according to the area by the 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:39.080
 street house 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:41.020
 and any time with gave them 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:44.870
 they also criticize that it combines the black color instead of the white one and so that it returns 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:47.870
 to repeat 

00:05:08.409 --> 00:05:11.479
 the deputy all that area where they communicate 

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:39.030
 this layer 

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:42.030
 let's put hair 

00:05:44.839 --> 00:05:47.839
 and standing on the miniature of the blue layer t 

00:05:51.199 --> 00:05:54.199
 I'm going to bet the color until I like the result 

00:06:08.789 --> 00:06:11.789
 friehling 22 39 mx 

00:06:22.759 --> 00:06:25.809
 I come to make a lower page 

00:06:25.809 --> 00:06:29.009
 and a finer brush I will finish reviewing the hair 

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:49.520
 for the cidh they also leave parity 

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:53.520
 since the excavation I want them to stand out just like the hair 

00:06:59.039 --> 00:07:01.939
 - careful not to leave 

00:07:01.939 --> 00:07:04.939
 with a fine brush 

00:07:18.529 --> 00:07:21.529
 and if we do not come out with a blur 

00:07:52.059 --> 00:07:56.189
 yes I am going to go over the bowels a bit with a martino brush and I have taken a 

00:07:56.189 --> 00:07:57.369
 opportunity to decrease
