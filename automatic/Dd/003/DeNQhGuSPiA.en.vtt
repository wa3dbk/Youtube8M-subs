00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:12.000
 few hours to the debut of the engine on the track 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:14.790
 we are really all excited in 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.160
 patients is a job that started more 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:20.910
 two years ago it involved electrons 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.020
 motorists project done together of 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.000
 common agreement with our colleagues 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.990
 chassis and therefore we really are 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:31.710
 proud to see the engine in 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:33.239
 car it is clear that it is only the beginning 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.950
 and only the beginning of this adventure does not 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.780
 we must lose concentration because 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.390
 much of the work still has to be 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.579
 made the reliability of an engine from 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.190
 formula 1 is done and I would say for 90 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.410
 percent over the counter and clear that this 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.809
 powertrain and completely new is a 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.920
 power train where energy recovery 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.860
 then the usage strategy 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.820
 important so we worked so hard 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.440
 at the desk 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.719
 we also had to update all the 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.059
 our simulation techniques for 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.620
 bring this powertrain a level 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.329
 very high in reliability 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.159
 so a lot of work at the counter but not 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.299
 only at the engine counter 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.240
 we have worked so hard also at 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.820
 simulator reading simulator because 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.140
 it was important that our pilots 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:15.090
 they began to understand how it works 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.509
 this powertrain and give us 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.220
 information to develop the tests in 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.740
 track therefore remain in any case 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.290
 these are the fundamental problems 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.900
 they are few and very close to 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:31.409
 championship so we will only need them 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:34.350
 for a refinement it is a confirmation of the 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:36.930
 product that we put in the car but 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.880
 unfortunately during bahrain tests we will be 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.390
 already in preparation of the race engines 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.360
 melbourne 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:45.600
 therefore there is no possibility of intervention 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.340
 the 2014 regulation states that one 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.229
 once you start the championship you don't 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.320
 can make changes to the engine that 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.700
 bring a performance increase 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.729
 so it is clear that until the last 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.409
 day we will try to introduce 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:59.420
 changes that increase performance 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:02.040
 of the powertrain 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:04.670
 on the other hand it is also true that 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:07.590
 penalties associated with breakages 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:10.560
 especially how much one will use the 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.620
 sixth power units are so high that 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.569
 reliability 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:15.580
 will play a key role this year 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:17.019
 so what we are doing in 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.159
 these days we were allowing 

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:20.590
 reliability 

00:02:18.159 --> 00:02:23.409
 basically it is a job this has 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:24.730
 really made a group because yes 

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:27.400
 it's about defining all the 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:29.319
 procedures to help our own 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.480
 suppliers that are important things in 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:34.599
 this phase is for what concerns 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:36.250
 the reliability that the first performance 

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:39.849
 among all shelley in this case why 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:41.290
 in the turbo engine performance comes a lot 

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:43.750
 of fuels and reliability is 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:45.579
 linked to purifying but all too 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.470
 acceptance checks of the parts in 

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:49.810
 home all assembly procedures 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:52.120
 so we are working hard for 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:54.549
 succeed in making the production of 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:57.879
 this most reliable power unit 

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:59.829
 possible and it is clear that even from the first 

00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:01.510
 test that we will do we will try to make 

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:06.359
 those changes you bring in 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:06.359
 reliability as the primary factor
