00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.099
 hi everyone i hope you 

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:10.719
 be ok I was talking to you about the apple 

00:00:09.099 --> 00:00:11.320
 watch monday and i want to continue 

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:12.730
 today 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:15.519
 but this time we will protect her 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:17.740
 with the hull ruetsch armor from 

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:19.090
 speed embarrassment it's true that it's not very 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:19.720
 common to protect a watch from 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:21.070
 watchmaker 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.750
 but I find that with the call wake 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:24.910
 it's a little bit different 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:27.550
 more with the sport version lucas does not have 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:29.500
 sapphire crystal screen inside 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:31.000
 the box of this shell we have two films 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.739
 plastics to protect the screen from the 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.969
 shows what's really cool about 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:35.679
 their part to provide them 

00:00:33.969 --> 00:00:38.949
 we also have a certificate of authenticity 

00:00:35.679 --> 00:00:40.659
 of course the hull that is right there we 

00:00:38.949 --> 00:00:42.969
 sees immediately applied the plastic film 

00:00:40.659 --> 00:00:45.039
 make up for watch to protect her for 

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:45.699
 it's very simple we take off the back 

00:00:45.039 --> 00:00:47.710
 plastic 

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:51.989
 then gently apply the film 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:55.620
 on our screen we take off the front 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:58.120
 and we hunt fast makes the bubbles 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.710
 overall that's what it gives you 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.049
 admit I was not doing very well 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:03.420
 stick but good since there are two 

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:07.000
 can afford to miss a 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:09.310
 the road armor here it is a hull 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.320
 black in my case for apple watch 42 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:13.480
 mm halls also exists for its 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.220
 little sister we really see that the 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:16.360
 shell is really bombay to cushion 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.850
 maximum shock 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.410
 if the watch falls to put it on 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:21.910
 our apple or watch is simple 

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:22.680
 first, we remove the 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:24.700
 bracelets 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:28.620
 now will slip the apple i watch to 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:31.890
 inside we enter the digital crown 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:31.890
 on the plate 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:37.720
 that's what is done now we can 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.280
 put back the bracelets and finally 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:41.740
 that's the result your apple watch is 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.360
 now super protected on the one hand with 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.370
 the plastic film we applied everything to 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.080
 the time but also thanks to the hull 

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:48.780
 covers the entire watch 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:50.980
 that's what's really good 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.840
 despite reinforcements a little bit 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:54.670
 everywhere we always have total access to 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.920
 all the connectors the crown 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.330
 digital turns perfectly well the 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.560
 power button was squarely entitled to 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.160
 a coating that is plastic 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.350
 bright 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:04.840
 on the other side the speakers and the microphone 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.940
 remains fully functional and back 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:09.970
 the heart rate sensor is 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:11.290
 always in touch with our skin 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:12.550
 we must admit that your apple watch 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:14.320
 is still a little bigger 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:15.670
 with this shell but it is rather 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:17.500
 not badly seen that it allows you both 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.820
 to protect your screen as I wanted 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.400
 10 goals he is not in direct contact 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:23.620
 with the surfaces it also protects 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.390
 against scratches and that she does everything 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.470
 the watch's turn but it protects 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:28.540
 also against shocks 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:30.600
 good between us the udc showed it on 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:32.770
 our wrist it will not fall a 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:34.000
 that I really found great with 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:36.070
 this shell is the fact that we have the 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.520
 detour buttons to remove 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:38.260
 bracelets 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:39.820
 it seems a little bit like saying 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.590
 that but on the last odds for 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:43.510
 watch reminder that I tested it 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:45.220
 covers is totally the buttons of the 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:47.200
 blow on the one hand we knew more where he 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:48.880
 was but even worse it was no longer 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.980
 clickable and blow to remove the 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.750
 bracelets it was a real tanner with 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.370
 this one not at all you can put 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.110
 the hull swap your bracelets as much 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:58.090
 of times that you want to not disturb 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:59.470
 not finally this shell is not 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:00.850
 very nice it must be admitted but if 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:02.890
 you often do manual work 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:04.930
 if you go to the forest if you do 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:06.850
 any other sport or activity 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.230
 which could damage your watch that 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:10.780
 strongly advise the rough 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:13.360
 spacejunk armor to your world 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:16.360
 will be in good hands or between 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:17.860
 your wrist that's what I can you 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:19.870
 say on this hull if you want you 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:21.250
 get it or even know its price 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:23.680
 you wanted to take a look in the 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.750
 description where you will put a link to 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.180
 mobile fun in this shop 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:31.400
