00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:55.570

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:03.430
 day we always had with the nasa 17 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:05.290
 something up with family 18th only 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:07.270
 announced today marks the first race 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:08.230
 that it was a bit more difficult with 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:10.900
 especially on the wind 

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:12.880
 had to do our best to keep up and 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:15.340
 then down wind and had to push hard 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.590
 double party to get them over 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.270
 again and again pass 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.650
 and yes we did our best and it 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.260
 good training for us 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:24.190
 so we are actually very satisfied there 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.510
 was a nice day 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:28.000
 from started this morning across from 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:30.790
 naruto can soften and the 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.620
 We did the first matches through and 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:37.090
 second match you don't drain 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:38.590
 while the one break that was in the car 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.290
 as the unpleasant but a break 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:43.690
 prefer to stay here but just go ahead 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:46.510
 that the afternoon games also went 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:48.610
 nice in the last potti was about it 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:50.620
 who who would win that 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.390
 who would win the pot like you were before 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:53.530
 the start likes you go up to them 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:56.970
 just put a little pressure 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:59.620
 one that he also secretly and we 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:03.220
 then race along to the left of 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:04.960
 the line we had a good start and now 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.040
 that all space needed because they went 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.410
 david very hard 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:09.770
 but here worthy of the wind 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:11.780
 therefore in t had to 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:14.120
 had to work put everything and everything 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:16.310
 to stay under it 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.300
 had succeeded they saw worbla a title 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.280
 of the year 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.170
 well sweet beautiful nature with a pack 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.480
 but in the end it goes because ours 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.750
 achieve training objectives and certainly 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.750
 this afternoon 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:29.420
 yes you really did and 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:31.610
 swim very nicely over the course and 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.710
 because it ultimately involves the 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:37.460
 difficult moment for my 18 formula 

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:38.570
 compare but miss yes and they have 

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:40.730
 just a super beautiful 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:43.340
 nicely hazards that clip is perspectives 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.840
 for the round tomorrow yes yes I love 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:47.510
 by the circle through the cutting water 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:49.940
 biggest concern and or further I think 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:51.770
 we like that we because we are with the front 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:53.210
 ranks can participate and their chance 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:56.120
 to work 

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:57.620
 I hope I continue that 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:01.460
 gives us a good starting position 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:04.100
 my fourth victory figure in a row 

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:05.060
 that la mort I am the only one in four 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:06.200
 has won times 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:08.090
 walk there is a second you in business 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:11.410
