00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.640
 honor herring 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:32.189
 for cooking we need hell 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:37.219

 spoon polya right on the bow I'm better 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.580
 marinate 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:20.700
 still add a little teaspoon and 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:28.870
 add two teaspoons of boiled water 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:35.650
 here so let about 15 minutes bow stand so 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:44.220
 I will marry further I'll take the egg 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:55.240
 I'll put the boil in the bowl 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:02:00.610
 cut off a slice of white bread and in white 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:02.970
 I will cut the bread, cut the crust on 4

 cut herring should be salted 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:50.230
 if suddenly the herring is salted you 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:52.730
 you need to soak it in milk or tea and 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:56.950
 if the herring is slightly salty then 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:59.390
