 the traditional balsamic vinegar of reggio emilia nata mature ages and yes 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.069
 refines in wooden barrels 

00:00:14.069 --> 00:00:16.939
 the most beautiful set of different wood essences 

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:19.939
 it is called a battery 

00:00:25.819 --> 00:00:29.929
 the battery normally consists of five barrels of different capacity 

00:00:30.479 --> 00:00:34.270
 the woods used mainly are im + oak 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:36.310
 the chestnut 

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:37.940
 the mulberry 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:39.520
 the cherry tree

 reggini pro 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.420
 to get an acid from the overall scents you need to diversify the 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:49.420
 wood essences in the composition of the battery 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:01.150
 the barrels commonly used have thick slats in an oblong shape with 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:04.150
 an opening at the top known as the bunghole 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.180
 this square shaped hole is relatively wide and allows 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:13.659
 easy barrel control including cleaning inspections 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.530
 the most suitable place for vinegar is the policy floor exposed to excursions 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:34.620
 thermal due to the succession of seasons that go well with the 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.659
 traditional reggio emilia balsamic vinegar cycle 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:41.670
 the hot period corresponds to the maximum activity 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.110
 in this period the natural alcoholic fermentations or oxidations take place 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.110
 accents that 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.180
 in the smallest caskets mainly reactions take place 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.020
 natural aging and maturation 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:06.549
 in which substances that are transferred from wood also contribute, contributing 

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:09.779
 to the formation of the characteristic buckley 

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:14.129
 since certification is an aerobic process that needs a lot of oxygen 

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:19.019
 it is essential that the plant be placed in an airy environment or not 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:21.829
 closed but in contact with its natural habitat
