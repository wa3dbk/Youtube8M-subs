man's<00:00:03.120> channel<00:00:03.510> so<00:00:03.659> I've<00:00:03.780> been<00:00:03.899> playing

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:04.080 
man's channel so I've been playing

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.470 
man's channel so I've been playing
around<00:00:04.410> a<00:00:04.500> little<00:00:04.589> more<00:00:04.740> with<00:00:05.069> this<00:00:05.330> with<00:00:06.330> this

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480 
around a little more with this with this

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:07.909 
around a little more with this with this
gear<00:00:06.720> box<00:00:06.930> here<00:00:07.259> and<00:00:07.379> what<00:00:07.470> I<00:00:07.500> did<00:00:07.770> was

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:07.919 
gear box here and what I did was

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:11.930 
gear box here and what I did was
actually<00:00:08.220> I<00:00:08.519> added<00:00:09.059> an<00:00:09.179> extra<00:00:10.280> cog<00:00:11.280> here<00:00:11.700> an

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
actually I added an extra cog here an

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.509 
actually I added an extra cog here an
extra<00:00:12.210> pulley<00:00:12.540> to<00:00:13.080> slow<00:00:13.320> bit<00:00:14.009> more<00:00:14.219> and<00:00:14.400> this

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
extra pulley to slow bit more and this

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.609 
extra pulley to slow bit more and this
seems<00:00:14.820> to<00:00:14.969> be<00:00:15.059> spinning<00:00:15.570> about<00:00:16.260> the<00:00:16.440> right

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
seems to be spinning about the right

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.620 
seems to be spinning about the right
speed<00:00:16.949> now<00:00:17.220> I've<00:00:17.460> got<00:00:17.699> a<00:00:17.730> mark<00:00:18.029> on<00:00:18.210> this<00:00:18.390> and

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
speed now I've got a mark on this and

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.179 
speed now I've got a mark on this and
all<00:00:18.720> this<00:00:18.900> I'll<00:00:19.140> start<00:00:19.410> this<00:00:19.560> thing<00:00:19.770> up<00:00:19.949> and

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
all this I'll start this thing up and

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.490 
all this I'll start this thing up and
and<00:00:20.640> let<00:00:20.820> you<00:00:20.910> see<00:00:21.090> it<00:00:21.180> running<00:00:21.390> and<00:00:21.720> you'll

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
and let you see it running and you'll

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:23.810 
and let you see it running and you'll
see<00:00:22.710> that<00:00:22.890> it's<00:00:23.070> spinning<00:00:23.430> quite<00:00:23.609> a<00:00:23.640> bit

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
see that it's spinning quite a bit

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.470 
see that it's spinning quite a bit
slower<00:00:24.090> now<00:00:24.240> so<00:00:25.400> see<00:00:26.400> my<00:00:26.580> mark<00:00:26.880> there<00:00:27.119> so<00:00:27.330> it's

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
slower now so see my mark there so it's

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.689 
slower now so see my mark there so it's
been<00:00:27.689> in<00:00:27.810> less<00:00:28.019> than<00:00:28.260> way<00:00:28.680> less<00:00:28.920> than<00:00:28.949> 60<00:00:29.580> I'm

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
been in less than way less than 60 I'm

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.139 
been in less than way less than 60 I'm
guessing<00:00:30.090> somewheres<00:00:30.480> between<00:00:30.689> no<00:00:31.820> 35<00:00:32.820> or

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
guessing somewheres between no 35 or

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.500 
guessing somewheres between no 35 or
maybe<00:00:33.329> 40<00:00:33.840> rpms<00:00:34.380> which<00:00:34.880> lining<00:00:35.880> it<00:00:36.000> up<00:00:36.090> with<00:00:36.149> my

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
maybe 40 rpms which lining it up with my

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.290 
maybe 40 rpms which lining it up with my
other<00:00:36.540> with<00:00:37.200> my<00:00:37.380> power<00:00:37.620> feeder<00:00:38.010> for<00:00:38.370> my<00:00:38.550> my

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
other with my power feeder for my my

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.600 
other with my power feeder for my my
router<00:00:39.600> table<00:00:39.899> it's<00:00:40.710> spinning<00:00:41.219> just<00:00:41.370> about

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
router table it's spinning just about

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.260 
router table it's spinning just about
right<00:00:41.879> now<00:00:42.680> so<00:00:43.680> the<00:00:44.309> next<00:00:44.550> stage<00:00:44.820> of<00:00:45.030> this<00:00:45.180> game

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
right now so the next stage of this game

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.450 
right now so the next stage of this game
is<00:00:45.750> you<00:00:46.050> know<00:00:46.170> I've<00:00:46.350> got<00:00:46.559> to<00:00:46.710> kind<00:00:47.129> of<00:00:47.250> make

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
is you know I've got to kind of make

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.190 
is you know I've got to kind of make
this<00:00:47.610> a<00:00:47.670> little<00:00:47.879> bit<00:00:48.090> more<00:00:48.300> compact<00:00:48.809> I<00:00:49.020> think

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
this a little bit more compact I think

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.510 
this a little bit more compact I think
I'm<00:00:49.289> going<00:00:49.379> to<00:00:49.440> try<00:00:49.620> to<00:00:49.649> move<00:00:49.890> the<00:00:50.070> motor<00:00:50.280> to

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
I'm going to try to move the motor to

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.889 
I'm going to try to move the motor to
the<00:00:50.640> top<00:00:50.850> and<00:00:51.210> then<00:00:52.140> I've<00:00:52.949> got<00:00:53.250> to<00:00:53.489> I've<00:00:54.390> got<00:00:54.750> to

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
the top and then I've got to I've got to

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.020 
the top and then I've got to I've got to
get<00:00:55.079> some<00:00:55.289> longer<00:00:55.739> bolts<00:00:56.129> or<00:00:56.280> some<00:00:56.640> some

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
get some longer bolts or some some

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.450 
get some longer bolts or some some
longer<00:00:57.449> shafts<00:00:57.719> here<00:00:58.199> because<00:00:58.949> I've<00:00:59.129> got<00:00:59.160> to

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
longer shafts here because I've got to

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.790 
longer shafts here because I've got to
add<00:00:59.609> a<00:01:00.059> little<00:01:00.570> pulley<00:01:00.809> to<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.230> side<00:01:01.500> of<00:01:01.710> this

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
add a little pulley to the side of this

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.729 
add a little pulley to the side of this
thing<00:01:02.039> now<00:01:02.250> or<00:01:02.280> a<00:01:02.520> little<00:01:02.789> sprocket<00:01:03.059> because

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:03.739 
thing now or a little sprocket because

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:08.270 
thing now or a little sprocket because
the<00:01:04.850> router<00:01:05.850> tape<00:01:06.180> runs<00:01:07.140> off<00:01:07.380> a<00:01:07.409> change<00:01:07.860> which

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
the router tape runs off a change which

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.520 
the router tape runs off a change which
is<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:09.299> best<00:01:09.510> way<00:01:09.689> of<00:01:09.720> doing<00:01:09.930> it<00:01:10.170> so<00:01:10.200> I'm<00:01:10.380> not

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
is the best way of doing it so I'm not

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.910 
is the best way of doing it so I'm not
going<00:01:10.710> to<00:01:10.770> switch<00:01:11.010> that<00:01:11.250> so<00:01:11.869> I've<00:01:12.869> got<00:01:13.140> to<00:01:13.260> get

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
going to switch that so I've got to get

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.580 
going to switch that so I've got to get
this<00:01:14.610> a<00:01:14.670> little<00:01:14.880> bit<00:01:15.119> thicker<00:01:15.780> so<00:01:16.080> that<00:01:16.229> I<00:01:16.259> can

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
this a little bit thicker so that I can

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.770 
this a little bit thicker so that I can
add<00:01:16.740> one<00:01:16.979> more<00:01:17.220> stage<00:01:17.549> this<00:01:17.909> and<00:01:18.150> I<00:01:18.330> figured

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
add one more stage this and I figured

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.240 
add one more stage this and I figured
out<00:01:18.869> a<00:01:18.930> simple<00:01:19.200> way<00:01:19.470> to<00:01:19.500> add<00:01:19.680> these<00:01:20.040> little

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
out a simple way to add these little

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.190 
out a simple way to add these little
pulleys<00:01:20.670> I<00:01:20.820> I've<00:01:21.450> got<00:01:21.659> a<00:01:21.689> bunch<00:01:21.960> of<00:01:22.080> these

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
pulleys I I've got a bunch of these

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.560 
pulleys I I've got a bunch of these
little<00:01:22.259> sprockets<00:01:23.040> around<00:01:23.340> here<00:01:23.700> that<00:01:24.270> got

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
little sprockets around here that got

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.600 
little sprockets around here that got
some<00:01:24.780> little<00:01:24.930> ears<00:01:25.320> on<00:01:25.500> it<00:01:25.530> here<00:01:25.890> and<00:01:25.920> you<00:01:26.490> know

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
some little ears on it here and you know

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.490 
some little ears on it here and you know
they<00:01:26.759> fit<00:01:26.939> on<00:01:27.119> there<00:01:27.330> 3/8<00:01:27.810> these<00:01:28.110> ones<00:01:28.350> here

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
they fit on there 3/8 these ones here

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:29.960 
they fit on there 3/8 these ones here
but<00:01:28.680> I'm<00:01:28.979> going<00:01:29.159> to<00:01:29.220> have<00:01:29.340> to<00:01:29.460> pick<00:01:29.610> up<00:01:29.640> one

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
but I'm going to have to pick up one

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.630 
but I'm going to have to pick up one
with<00:01:30.150> a<00:01:30.180> 5/8<00:01:30.720> shaft<00:01:31.170> and<00:01:31.439> then<00:01:32.340> it'll<00:01:32.549> just

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
with a 5/8 shaft and then it'll just

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.370 
with a 5/8 shaft and then it'll just
slide<00:01:33.090> through<00:01:33.420> you<00:01:33.659> know<00:01:33.780> how<00:01:33.869> to<00:01:33.930> figure

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
slide through you know how to figure

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.630 
slide through you know how to figure
that<00:01:34.530> I<00:01:34.560> could<00:01:34.799> just<00:01:34.979> slide<00:01:35.220> it<00:01:35.400> through<00:01:35.430> the

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
that I could just slide it through the

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.789 
that I could just slide it through the
wooden<00:01:35.970> pulley<00:01:36.210> with<00:01:37.079> the<00:01:37.110> shaft<00:01:37.439> and<00:01:37.680> then

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
wooden pulley with the shaft and then

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.560 
wooden pulley with the shaft and then
add<00:01:38.009> a<00:01:38.040> couple<00:01:38.340> of<00:01:38.490> screws<00:01:38.759> here<00:01:39.060> so<00:01:39.240> that<00:01:39.390> when

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
add a couple of screws here so that when

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.810 
add a couple of screws here so that when
it<00:01:40.320> runs<00:01:40.409> up<00:01:40.829> against<00:01:41.250> it<00:01:41.340> that's<00:01:41.490> going<00:01:41.759> to

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
it runs up against it that's going to

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.030 
it runs up against it that's going to
lock<00:01:42.030> it<00:01:42.060> as<00:01:42.450> you<00:01:43.170> can<00:01:43.350> see<00:01:43.530> here<00:01:43.799> and<00:01:43.920> then

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
lock it as you can see here and then

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.190 
lock it as you can see here and then
that<00:01:44.220> will<00:01:44.369> enable<00:01:44.610> it<00:01:44.880> to<00:01:45.509> spin<00:01:45.780> the<00:01:45.930> chain

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
that will enable it to spin the chain

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.050 
that will enable it to spin the chain
off<00:01:46.710> of<00:01:46.770> one<00:01:47.130> of<00:01:47.250> these<00:01:47.340> wooden<00:01:47.640> poise<00:01:47.820> and

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
off of one of these wooden poise and

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.359 
off of one of these wooden poise and
kind<00:01:48.329> of<00:01:48.360> a<00:01:48.450> neat<00:01:48.630> way<00:01:48.840> or<00:01:49.079> a<00:01:49.320> real<00:01:49.829> simple<00:01:50.250> way

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
kind of a neat way or a real simple way

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.490 
kind of a neat way or a real simple way
is<00:01:50.579> all<00:01:50.759> it<00:01:50.880> is<00:01:50.970> a<00:01:51.000> real<00:01:51.299> simple<00:01:51.720> and<00:01:51.960> fast<00:01:52.200> way

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
is all it is a real simple and fast way

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.649 
is all it is a real simple and fast way
to<00:01:52.799> hook<00:01:53.310> it<00:01:53.430> on<00:01:53.549> so<00:01:53.759> then<00:01:53.909> this<00:01:54.090> set<00:01:54.299> of<00:01:54.420> chains

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
to hook it on so then this set of chains

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.600 
to hook it on so then this set of chains
will<00:01:54.899> run<00:01:55.079> down<00:01:55.320> to<00:01:55.560> another<00:01:55.770> two<00:01:56.070> sprocket

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
will run down to another two sprocket

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.600 
will run down to another two sprocket
which<00:01:57.299> will<00:01:57.570> connect<00:01:58.320> the<00:01:58.500> little<00:01:58.740> rubber

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
which will connect the little rubber

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.670 
which will connect the little rubber
wheels<00:01:59.969> to<00:02:00.329> run<00:02:00.509> the<00:02:00.659> power<00:02:00.869> feeder<00:02:01.259> for<00:02:01.590> the
