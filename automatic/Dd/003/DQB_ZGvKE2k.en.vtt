defending against an open by the small

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:37.800 
defending against an open by the small
blind<00:00:35.260> is<00:00:35.590> a<00:00:36.030> really<00:00:37.030> favorable<00:00:37.510> situation

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:37.810 
blind is a really favorable situation

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:43.260 
blind is a really favorable situation
and<00:00:38.560> is<00:00:38.920> one<00:00:39.190> which<00:00:39.400> is<00:00:39.430> often<00:00:39.850> ignored<00:00:41.460> if<00:00:42.460> you

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:43.270 
and is one which is often ignored if you

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:44.729 
and is one which is often ignored if you
just<00:00:43.480> think<00:00:43.570> about<00:00:43.870> it<00:00:44.170> for<00:00:44.200> a<00:00:44.440> little<00:00:44.590> bit

00:00:44.729 --> 00:00:44.739 
just think about it for a little bit

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:47.520 
just think about it for a little bit
when<00:00:45.730> the<00:00:45.880> small<00:00:46.150> blind<00:00:46.360> opens<00:00:46.930> let's<00:00:47.200> say<00:00:47.350> he

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:47.530 
when the small blind opens let's say he

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:52.350 
when the small blind opens let's say he
opens<00:00:47.890> to<00:00:48.250> a<00:00:48.280> standard<00:00:48.850> 3<00:00:49.570> x<00:00:49.920> rays<00:00:51.360> you're

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:52.360 
opens to a standard 3 x rays you're

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:54.990 
opens to a standard 3 x rays you're
getting<00:00:52.660> two<00:00:53.140> to<00:00:53.320> one<00:00:53.530> odds<00:00:53.739> to<00:00:54.310> call<00:00:54.640> and

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:55.000 
getting two to one odds to call and

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.569 
getting two to one odds to call and
you're<00:00:55.989> going<00:00:56.110> to<00:00:56.170> have<00:00:56.380> position<00:00:56.980> for<00:00:57.489> the

00:00:57.569 --> 00:00:57.579 
you're going to have position for the

00:00:57.579 --> 00:00:59.729 
you're going to have position for the
remainder<00:00:57.850> of<00:00:58.030> the<00:00:58.239> hand<00:00:58.480> which<00:00:59.200> is<00:00:59.440> very

00:00:59.729 --> 00:00:59.739 
remainder of the hand which is very

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:01.620 
remainder of the hand which is very
different<00:01:00.070> from<00:01:00.309> when<00:01:00.520> the<00:01:00.670> button<00:01:00.880> or<00:01:01.210> the<00:01:01.239> or

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:01.630 
different from when the button or the or

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:04.079 
different from when the button or the or
the<00:01:01.660> cutoff<00:01:02.110> opens<00:01:02.760> where<00:01:03.760> you're<00:01:03.910> going<00:01:04.030> to

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:04.089 
the cutoff opens where you're going to

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:07.010 
the cutoff opens where you're going to
be<00:01:04.210> out<00:01:04.239> of<00:01:04.390> position<00:01:04.689> for<00:01:05.259> the<00:01:05.350> whole<00:01:05.469> hand<00:01:05.770> ah

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
be out of position for the whole hand ah

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.350 
be out of position for the whole hand ah
so<00:01:08.190> when<00:01:09.190> you're<00:01:09.340> getting<00:01:09.610> two<00:01:09.850> to<00:01:10.000> one<00:01:10.150> odds

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:10.360 
so when you're getting two to one odds

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:13.649 
so when you're getting two to one odds
that<00:01:10.690> means<00:01:11.080> you<00:01:11.770> only<00:01:12.130> need<00:01:12.610> thirty<00:01:13.180> three

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:13.659 
that means you only need thirty three

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:17.190 
that means you only need thirty three
percent<00:01:13.690> equity<00:01:14.350> to<00:01:15.340> break<00:01:15.549> even<00:01:15.960> if<00:01:16.960> you're

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:17.200 
percent equity to break even if you're

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.180 
percent equity to break even if you're
going<00:01:17.320> to<00:01:17.440> call<00:01:18.479> so<00:01:19.479> now<00:01:19.630> what<00:01:20.200> I<00:01:20.229> did<00:01:20.560> was<00:01:20.830> in

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:21.190 
going to call so now what I did was in

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:23.490 
going to call so now what I did was in
order<00:01:21.580> to<00:01:21.700> get<00:01:21.850> kind<00:01:22.090> of<00:01:22.180> a<00:01:22.270> basic<00:01:22.810> starting

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:23.500 
order to get kind of a basic starting

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.520 
order to get kind of a basic starting
point<00:01:23.820> for<00:01:24.820> you<00:01:25.570> know<00:01:25.690> what<00:01:25.869> kind<00:01:25.990> of<00:01:26.140> ranges

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:26.530 
point for you know what kind of ranges

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:29.490 
point for you know what kind of ranges
we<00:01:26.710> should<00:01:26.920> be<00:01:27.070> looking<00:01:27.220> to<00:01:27.549> defend<00:01:27.700> I<00:01:28.260> made<00:01:29.260> up

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:29.500 
we should be looking to defend I made up

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.460 
we should be looking to defend I made up
a<00:01:29.970> opening<00:01:30.970> range<00:01:31.210> for<00:01:31.479> the<00:01:31.570> small<00:01:31.840> blind<00:01:32.080> when

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:32.470 
a opening range for the small blind when

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:36.660 
a opening range for the small blind when
it<00:01:32.530> folds<00:01:32.890> to<00:01:33.190> him<00:01:33.369> and<00:01:34.200> I<00:01:35.200> decided<00:01:35.650> we're<00:01:36.369> just

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:36.670 
it folds to him and I decided we're just

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:38.789 
it folds to him and I decided we're just
going<00:01:36.820> to<00:01:36.880> give<00:01:37.060> them<00:01:37.210> like<00:01:38.049> a<00:01:38.080> thirty-five

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:38.799 
going to give them like a thirty-five

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:40.770 
going to give them like a thirty-five
percent<00:01:39.070> range<00:01:39.549> you<00:01:40.210> know<00:01:40.330> kind<00:01:40.630> of<00:01:40.689> a

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:40.780 
percent range you know kind of a

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:45.090 
percent range you know kind of a
reasonable<00:01:41.320> range<00:01:43.049> so<00:01:44.049> here<00:01:44.439> we<00:01:44.560> can<00:01:44.590> see<00:01:44.920> that

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:45.100 
reasonable range so here we can see that

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.609 
reasonable range so here we can see that
range<00:01:45.430> there<00:01:45.820> that<00:01:46.119> I<00:01:46.210> made<00:01:46.420> up<00:01:46.450> for<00:01:46.930> the<00:01:46.960> small

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:47.619 
range there that I made up for the small

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:51.120 
range there that I made up for the small
blind<00:01:47.860> it's<00:01:48.250> basically<00:01:49.320> Broadway's<00:01:50.320> any<00:01:50.830> Ace

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.130

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:54.890 
blind it's basically Broadway's any Ace
any<00:01:51.490> pair<00:01:52.000> and<00:01:52.270> a<00:01:53.200> few<00:01:53.409> suited<00:01:53.770> connectors

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:54.900 
any pair and a few suited connectors

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.210 
any pair and a few suited connectors
once<00:01:55.900> i<00:01:56.110> had<00:01:56.350> that<00:01:56.560> thirty<00:01:56.920> five<00:01:57.189> percent

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:57.220 
once i had that thirty five percent

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:00.810 
once i had that thirty five percent
range<00:01:57.880> i<00:01:58.210> decided<00:01:59.140> to<00:01:59.320> see<00:01:59.590> which<00:01:59.890> hands<00:02:00.460> had

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:00.820 
range i decided to see which hands had

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.390 
range i decided to see which hands had
the<00:02:01.180> thirty-three<00:02:01.869> percent<00:02:02.049> equity<00:02:02.590> we<00:02:03.159> need

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:03.400 
the thirty-three percent equity we need

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.370 
the thirty-three percent equity we need
against<00:02:03.970> that<00:02:04.119> range<00:02:04.420> when<00:02:05.110> we're<00:02:05.290> getting

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
against that range when we're getting

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.210 
against that range when we're getting
two<00:02:05.740> to<00:02:05.860> one<00:02:06.009> odds<00:02:07.079> the<00:02:08.079> answer<00:02:08.500> is<00:02:08.530> amazing

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.220 
two to one odds the answer is amazing

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:12.390 
two to one odds the answer is amazing
that's<00:02:09.879> the<00:02:10.209> range<00:02:10.420> there<00:02:10.689> that<00:02:10.869> i<00:02:10.959> got<00:02:11.170> on<00:02:11.409> as

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
that's the range there that i got on as

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.400 
that's the range there that i got on as
you<00:02:13.090> can<00:02:13.209> see<00:02:13.390> it's<00:02:13.540> a<00:02:13.599> seventy-nine<00:02:14.200> percent

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410 
you can see it's a seventy-nine percent

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:16.920 
you can see it's a seventy-nine percent
range<00:02:14.890> that<00:02:15.250> has<00:02:15.280> enough<00:02:15.849> equity<00:02:16.060> to<00:02:16.330> continue

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
range that has enough equity to continue

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.490
