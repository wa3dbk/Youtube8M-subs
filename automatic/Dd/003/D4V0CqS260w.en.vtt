00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
agree with um has this little sphere

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:57.770 
agree with um has this little sphere
here<00:00:56.399> I<00:00:56.670> don't<00:00:57.000> know<00:00:57.120> the<00:00:57.239> correct<00:00:57.510> name<00:00:57.750> for

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
here I don't know the correct name for

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.959 
here I don't know the correct name for
but<00:00:58.289> if<00:00:58.410> you<00:00:58.500> slide<00:00:58.739> this<00:00:58.859> over<00:00:59.039> you<00:00:59.730> can<00:00:59.760> see

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
but if you slide this over you can see

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.970 
but if you slide this over you can see
that<00:01:00.120> right<00:01:00.210> there<00:01:00.270> um<00:01:00.660> you<00:01:01.649> can<00:01:01.800> basically

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
that right there um you can basically

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.160 
that right there um you can basically
put<00:01:02.219> another<00:01:02.520> adapter<00:01:03.210> piece<00:01:03.390> on<00:01:03.539> there<00:01:03.750> and

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
put another adapter piece on there and

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.170 
put another adapter piece on there and
that's<00:01:04.439> for<00:01:04.589> measuring<00:01:04.979> light<00:01:05.189> for<00:01:05.489> flat

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
that's for measuring light for flat

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.539 
that's for measuring light for flat
surfaces<00:01:06.210> such<00:01:07.080> as<00:01:07.110> like<00:01:07.500> paintings<00:01:08.070> pictures

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
surfaces such as like paintings pictures

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.859 
surfaces such as like paintings pictures
on<00:01:08.700> the<00:01:08.820> wall<00:01:09.439> or<00:01:10.439> even<00:01:10.500> the<00:01:10.920> wall<00:01:11.360> also<00:01:12.360> for

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
on the wall or even the wall also for

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.260 
on the wall or even the wall also for
like<00:01:12.990> if<00:01:13.770> you're<00:01:13.950> looking<00:01:14.189> for<00:01:14.369> even<00:01:14.670> exposure

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
like if you're looking for even exposure

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.700 
like if you're looking for even exposure
on<00:01:15.630> an<00:01:15.750> infinite<00:01:15.960> white<00:01:16.259> backdrop<00:01:16.530> or<00:01:18.200> a<00:01:19.200> green

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
on an infinite white backdrop or a green

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.760 
on an infinite white backdrop or a green
screen<00:01:20.009> blue<00:01:20.790> screen<00:01:21.180> whatever<00:01:21.680> that's<00:01:22.680> what

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
screen blue screen whatever that's what

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.859 
screen blue screen whatever that's what
that's<00:01:22.950> useful<00:01:23.159> as<00:01:23.880> different<00:01:24.360> modes<00:01:24.509> on<00:01:24.689> here

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
that's useful as different modes on here

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.320 
that's useful as different modes on here
there's<00:01:25.110> a<00:01:25.170> pitcher<00:01:25.950> mode<00:01:26.130> and<00:01:26.430> there's<00:01:27.180> also

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
there's a pitcher mode and there's also

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.160 
there's a pitcher mode and there's also
a<00:01:27.770> cinematic<00:01:28.770> mode<00:01:28.920> for<00:01:29.390> videographers<00:01:30.390> and

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
a cinematic mode for videographers and

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.210 
a cinematic mode for videographers and
that's<00:01:31.350> what<00:01:31.500> this<00:01:31.590> was<00:01:31.740> kind<00:01:31.920> of<00:01:31.979> geared

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
that's what this was kind of geared

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.490 
that's what this was kind of geared
towards<00:01:32.310> and<00:01:32.790> then<00:01:33.450> it<00:01:33.810> still<00:01:34.200> has<00:01:34.350> the

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
towards and then it still has the

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.520 
towards and then it still has the
photography<00:01:35.159> functions<00:01:35.700> but<00:01:36.200> the<00:01:37.200> other<00:01:37.350> one

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
photography functions but the other one

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:38.990 
photography functions but the other one
that<00:01:37.560> was<00:01:37.710> in<00:01:37.829> the<00:01:37.890> same<00:01:38.070> price<00:01:38.340> range<00:01:38.460> I<00:01:38.850> can

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
that was in the same price range I can

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.490 
that was in the same price range I can
remember<00:01:39.119> the<00:01:39.299> name<00:01:39.479> of<00:01:39.509> it<00:01:39.750> but<00:01:39.990> it's<00:01:40.110> like<00:01:40.170> it

something like that it's pretty much the
same<00:01:44.670> price<00:01:45.000> but<00:01:45.329> it<00:01:45.990> doesn't<00:01:46.380> have<00:01:46.500> the<00:01:46.740> video

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
same price but it doesn't have the video
