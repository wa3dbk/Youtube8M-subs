hello<00:00:13.060> my<00:00:13.960> name<00:00:14.110> is<00:00:14.200> my<00:00:14.410> brother<00:00:14.650> today<00:00:15.520> we're

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:15.760 
hello my name is my brother today we're

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:18.060 
hello my name is my brother today we're
going<00:00:15.940> to<00:00:16.030> talk<00:00:16.209> about<00:00:16.390> linear<00:00:16.660> workflow<00:00:17.290> and

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:18.070 
going to talk about linear workflow and

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:20.490 
going to talk about linear workflow and
how<00:00:18.580> we<00:00:18.640> can<00:00:18.880> apply<00:00:19.090> it<00:00:19.210> in<00:00:19.390> 3ds<00:00:19.750> max<00:00:19.779> and<00:00:20.260> be<00:00:20.470> a

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:20.500 
how we can apply it in 3ds max and be a

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.960 
how we can apply it in 3ds max and be a
ring<00:00:21.090> so<00:00:22.140> let's<00:00:23.140> go<00:00:23.320> ahead<00:00:23.349> and<00:00:23.590> get<00:00:23.770> started

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
ring so let's go ahead and get started

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.290 
ring so let's go ahead and get started
here<00:00:24.970> I<00:00:25.000> have<00:00:25.240> a<00:00:25.270> simple<00:00:25.599> scene<00:00:26.050> with<00:00:26.950> a<00:00:27.300> sphere

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:28.300 
here I have a simple scene with a sphere

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:34.290 
here I have a simple scene with a sphere
inside<00:00:29.009> the<00:00:30.009> material<00:00:32.790> one<00:00:33.790> under<00:00:34.000> the<00:00:34.030> Sun

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:34.300 
inside the material one under the Sun

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:39.680 
inside the material one under the Sun
reflecting<00:00:34.810> all<00:00:35.470> right<00:00:35.649> it's<00:00:36.160> a<00:00:36.280> parameter<00:00:37.350> so

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
reflecting all right it's a parameter so

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.540 
reflecting all right it's a parameter so
before<00:00:40.690> starting<00:00:41.230> in<00:00:41.350> and<00:00:41.500> wondering<00:00:41.949> or<00:00:42.219> any

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:42.550 
before starting in and wondering or any

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:45.170

vray<00:00:43.149> let's<00:00:43.629> go<00:00:43.840> ahead<00:00:43.930> and<00:00:44.079> and<00:00:44.379> and

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
vray let's go ahead and and and

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.099 
vray let's go ahead and and and

turn you will see the color that you
will<00:01:21.690> see<00:01:22.690> in<00:01:22.900> your<00:01:23.230> final<00:01:23.590> render<00:01:24.010> so<00:01:24.940> the

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:25.120 
will see in your final render so the

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:27.120 
will see in your final render so the
same<00:01:25.420> color<00:01:25.810> you<00:01:26.080> will<00:01:26.200> see<00:01:26.440> in<00:01:26.590> your<00:01:26.710> material

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.130 
same color you will see in your material

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:31.320 
same color you will see in your material
slot<00:01:27.930> you're<00:01:28.930> being<00:01:29.140> in<00:01:29.350> the<00:01:29.560> final<00:01:29.890> angle<00:01:30.330> now

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:31.330 
slot you're being in the final angle now

this value sometimes making it to one is

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.580 
this value sometimes making it to one is
correct<00:01:44.920> but<00:01:45.670> you<00:01:45.820> have<00:01:46.060> to<00:01:46.300> enter<00:01:46.480> 2.2<00:01:47.290> each

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:47.590 
correct but you have to enter 2.2 each

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:51.720 
correct but you have to enter 2.2 each
time<00:01:47.860> we<00:01:48.250> load<00:01:48.430> a<00:01:48.640> texture<00:01:49.030> as<00:01:49.210> a<00:01:49.270> bitmap<00:01:50.730> which

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:51.730 
time we load a texture as a bitmap which

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:54.600 
time we load a texture as a bitmap which
is<00:01:51.880> time<00:01:52.090> consuming<00:01:52.270> so<00:01:52.900> make<00:01:53.770> it<00:01:53.920> to<00:01:54.100> point<00:01:54.310> to

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:54.610 
is time consuming so make it to point to

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:57.230 
is time consuming so make it to point to
and<00:01:54.850> if<00:01:55.060> you<00:01:55.330> your<00:01:55.960> texture<00:01:56.320> look<00:01:56.590> darker

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
and if you your texture look darker

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.060 
and if you your texture look darker
change<00:01:58.240> it<00:01:58.450> to<00:01:59.020> 1<00:01:59.290> by<00:01:59.800> own<00:02:00.040> writing<00:02:00.520> its<00:02:01.000> volume

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
change it to 1 by own writing its volume

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:13.100 
change it to 1 by own writing its volume
