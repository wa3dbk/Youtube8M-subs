 your images turned out to be more 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:18.470
 qualitatively more beautiful that on her 

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:20.660
 Prince could see well, that for 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:22.150
 beginnings we will need a framework this 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:26.179
 card which is already 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:31.220

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:41.940
 image pixels to become more 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:46.549

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:19.930
