00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.649 

okay<00:00:00.659> the<00:00:00.960> object<00:00:01.410> is<00:00:01.589> to<00:00:01.620> change<00:00:02.159> the<00:00:02.659> valve

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:03.659 
okay the object is to change the valve

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:06.260 
okay the object is to change the valve
from<00:00:03.959> the<00:00:04.020> outside<00:00:04.589> we<00:00:05.460> have<00:00:05.580> some<00:00:05.819> special

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 
from the outside we have some special

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.459 
from the outside we have some special
tools<00:00:06.560> this<00:00:07.560> one<00:00:07.859> you<00:00:07.980> grab<00:00:08.360> that<00:00:09.360> device<00:00:10.139> them

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
tools this one you grab that device them

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.030 
tools this one you grab that device them
from<00:00:11.300> you<00:00:12.300> slide<00:00:12.599> it<00:00:12.780> in<00:00:13.019> between<00:00:13.080> the<00:00:13.620> FET

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
from you slide it in between the FET

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.230 
from you slide it in between the FET
there<00:00:14.660> the<00:00:15.660> rim<00:00:16.039> and<00:00:17.039> get<00:00:17.250> it<00:00:17.369> here<00:00:17.760> and<00:00:18.090> you

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
there the rim and get it here and you

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.090 
there the rim and get it here and you
grab<00:00:19.100> in<00:00:20.100> the<00:00:20.520> hole<00:00:20.760> and<00:00:21.109> then<00:00:22.109> just<00:00:22.350> pull<00:00:22.980> it

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
grab in the hole and then just pull it

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.599 
grab in the hole and then just pull it
out<00:00:23.779> then<00:00:24.779> we<00:00:24.810> have<00:00:25.050> a<00:00:25.230> special<00:00:25.769> funnel<00:00:26.369> type

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
out then we have a special funnel type

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.460 
out then we have a special funnel type
tool<00:00:26.970> here<00:00:27.420> where<00:00:28.260> you<00:00:28.500> put<00:00:28.800> there<00:00:29.519> the<00:00:30.470> valve

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
tool here where you put there the valve

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.970 
tool here where you put there the valve
in<00:00:31.800> push<00:00:32.790> it<00:00:33.000> through<00:00:33.180> the<00:00:33.270> funnel<00:00:33.739> pops<00:00:34.739> out

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
in push it through the funnel pops out

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.180 
in push it through the funnel pops out
on<00:00:35.190> the<00:00:35.280> other<00:00:35.370> side<00:00:35.730> and<00:00:36.059> it's<00:00:37.020> inside<00:00:37.590> and

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
on the other side and it's inside and

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.470 
on the other side and it's inside and
then<00:00:38.340> you<00:00:38.489> just<00:00:38.730> pull<00:00:39.000> it<00:00:39.120> back<00:00:39.149> so<00:00:41.480> this

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
then you just pull it back so this

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.270 
then you just pull it back so this
particular<00:00:42.989> rim<00:00:44.000> is<00:00:45.410> extra<00:00:46.410> difficult<00:00:46.920> to<00:00:47.100> do

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
particular rim is extra difficult to do

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.290 
particular rim is extra difficult to do
it<00:00:47.489> with<00:00:47.700> because<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.480> valve<00:00:48.809> is<00:00:49.590> recessed<00:00:50.340> so

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
it with because the valve is recessed so

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.549 
it with because the valve is recessed so
in<00:00:51.629> on<00:00:51.870> the<00:00:52.649> regular<00:00:53.280> steel<00:00:53.670> rims<00:00:54.320> the<00:00:55.320> valve

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
in on the regular steel rims the valve

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.819 
in on the regular steel rims the valve
is<00:00:55.800> flat<00:00:56.760> with<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.120> rim<00:00:57.390> and<00:00:57.690> to<00:00:58.379> get<00:00:58.620> this

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
is flat with the rim and to get this

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.090 
is flat with the rim and to get this
tool<00:00:59.100> in<00:00:59.430> is<00:00:59.760> not<00:01:00.090> that<00:01:00.480> difficult<00:01:00.890> so<00:01:01.890> it's<00:01:02.010> a

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
tool in is not that difficult so it's a

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.770 
tool in is not that difficult so it's a
little<00:01:02.280> bit<00:01:02.489> of<00:01:02.699> a<00:01:02.789> fight<00:01:03.600> to<00:01:04.470> get<00:01:04.680> the<00:01:04.860> tool<00:01:05.129> in

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:05.780 
little bit of a fight to get the tool in

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.630 
little bit of a fight to get the tool in
to<00:01:06.780> pull<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.140> old<00:01:07.260> one<00:01:07.409> out<00:01:07.650> once<00:01:08.159> we<00:01:08.369> have<00:01:08.520> the

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
to pull the old one out once we have the

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.240 
to pull the old one out once we have the
old<00:01:08.790> one<00:01:09.000> out<00:01:09.119> we<00:01:09.960> are<00:01:10.020> more<00:01:10.740> or<00:01:10.830> less<00:01:10.890> home

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
old one out we are more or less home

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.870 
old one out we are more or less home
free<00:01:11.580> so<00:01:12.330> you<00:01:12.390> start<00:01:12.720> by<00:01:13.100> inflating<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.670> tire

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
free so you start by inflating the tire

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.240 
free so you start by inflating the tire
you<00:01:15.840> don't<00:01:16.020> need<00:01:16.200> to<00:01:16.350> need<00:01:16.470> to<00:01:16.619> take<00:01:16.799> the<00:01:16.979> tire

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
you don't need to need to take the tire

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.960 
you don't need to need to take the tire
out<00:01:17.549> the<00:01:18.540> rim<00:01:18.750> off<00:01:19.020> or<00:01:19.369> fire<00:01:20.369> off<00:01:20.610> the<00:01:20.820> rim

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
out the rim off or fire off the rim

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:34.399 
out the rim off or fire off the rim
that's<00:01:21.299> the<00:01:21.509> idea<00:01:21.869> with<00:01:22.080> this<00:01:25.820> so<00:01:26.820> to<00:01:27.330> get

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.880 

this<00:01:34.950> is<00:01:35.130> grabbing<00:01:36.119> it<00:01:36.270> from<00:01:36.539> the<00:01:36.890> whole

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
this is grabbing it from the whole

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:44.620 
this is grabbing it from the whole
inside<00:01:38.780> and<00:01:40.159> then<00:01:41.210> it<00:01:42.210> comes<00:01:42.509> out<00:01:42.689> okay<00:01:43.320> I

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.630 
inside and then it comes out okay I

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.539 
inside and then it comes out okay I
think<00:01:45.630> that's<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.320> probably<00:01:47.250> the<00:01:47.369> most

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
think that's the probably the most

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.830 
think that's the probably the most
difficult<00:01:48.469> then<00:01:49.469> we<00:01:49.649> put<00:01:49.860> the<00:01:50.070> the<00:01:50.840> funnel

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
difficult then we put the the funnel

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.710 
difficult then we put the the funnel
type<00:01:52.079> thing<00:01:52.860> and<00:01:53.100> we<00:01:54.090> push<00:01:54.329> in<00:01:54.539> the<00:01:55.369> the<00:01:56.369> back

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:56.720 
type thing and we push in the the back

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:01.010 
type thing and we push in the the back
now<00:01:57.720> the<00:01:57.780> valve<00:01:58.110> is<00:01:58.380> in<00:01:58.560> place<00:01:58.880> and<00:01:59.880> we<00:02:00.240> pull<00:02:00.899> it

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
now the valve is in place and we pull it

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:10.029 
now the valve is in place and we pull it
out<00:02:02.210> take<00:02:03.210> off<00:02:03.509> them<00:02:06.500> the<00:02:07.500> pulling<00:02:07.860> tool<00:02:08.160> and

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:10.039 
out take off them the pulling tool and

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:16.600 
out take off them the pulling tool and
the<00:02:11.039> valve<00:02:11.250> is<00:02:11.430> place<00:02:12.290> ready<00:02:13.290> to<00:02:13.500> be<00:02:13.650> in<00:02:13.860> place

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:20.360 

so<00:02:17.610> it<00:02:17.819> doesn't<00:02:17.849> take<00:02:18.360> a<00:02:18.569> lot<00:02:18.900> of<00:02:18.959> time<00:02:19.349> but<00:02:20.160> of

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
so it doesn't take a lot of time but of

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.900 
so it doesn't take a lot of time but of
course<00:02:20.640> it's<00:02:20.819> a<00:02:20.910> little<00:02:20.970> extra<00:02:21.209> effort<00:02:21.750> to<00:02:22.910> put

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
course it's a little extra effort to put

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:43.020 
course it's a little extra effort to put
so<00:02:24.180> now<00:02:28.459> tie<00:02:29.459> pressure<00:02:29.760> way<00:02:30.030> we<00:02:30.180> want<00:02:30.420> it<00:02:30.569> to<00:02:31.640> 32

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:51.890 

I<00:02:43.060> like<00:02:43.720> to<00:02:43.900> run<00:02:44.080> this<00:02:44.260> at<00:02:44.470> 33

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.500 

that's<00:02:52.500> what<00:02:52.739> I<00:02:52.769> wanted

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:57.790 

we<00:02:55.569> have<00:02:55.780> the<00:02:55.930> valve<00:02:56.140> caps

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:57.800 
we have the valve caps

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.910 
we have the valve caps
they<00:02:58.280> can<00:02:58.520> stick<00:02:58.730> their<00:02:58.760> off

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 
they can stick their off

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:18.270 
they can stick their off
the<00:03:01.250> bottom

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:22.320 

you<00:03:18.730> on<00:03:18.880> the<00:03:19.060> wrong<00:03:19.240> camp

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:22.330 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:28.330 

get<00:03:22.420> it<00:03:22.570> all<00:03:22.810> the<00:03:22.870> way<00:03:23.140> down

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:28.340 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:31.460 

screw<00:03:28.730> it

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:36.510 

-<00:03:31.620> flash

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:36.520 

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:39.580 

and<00:03:37.390> put<00:03:37.630> it<00:03:37.750> back<00:03:37.900> on

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:39.590 
and put it back on

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:44.170 
and put it back on
now<00:03:40.130> all<00:03:40.730> set<00:03:41.090> and<00:03:41.569> ready<00:03:41.660> to<00:03:42.020> go
