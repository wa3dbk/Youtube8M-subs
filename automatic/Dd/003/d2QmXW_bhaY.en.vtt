00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:06.460
 let's set up a folder to 

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:09.730
 share it within our group of 

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:12.610
 I work in our Wi-Fi home network and 

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:16.109
 so you can access it from any 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:19.630
 device connected to our wifi network 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:24.210
 and be able to share with others the 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:24.210
 files that we can store in it 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:31.140
 in windows 7 we have the option of 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:33.239
 share with a group at home a 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.640
 group at home is the option that 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:38.400
 they have the equipment they have installed 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.280
 at least windows 7 to share 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:43.590
 files within a home network 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.960
 The problem of the group at home is that 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.600
 We can not access your content or 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:52.050
 the shared folders from others 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:54.510
 computers with windows xp or devices 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.600
 android therefore what are we going to 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:00.180
 to do is how we have created a group of 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:05.090
 home that includes computers with windows 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:07.860
 xp windows 7 and android devices is 

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:10.020
 configure the folder that we have created 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:13.470
 in our team with windows 7 that 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.990
 called pc folder and that contains a photo 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.960
 we are going to configure it to be 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:21.119
 accessible by all the teams that 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:24.220
 are connected to our group of 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:27.550
 work within our wifi network 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:29.820
 for it in the organize tab 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:33.690
 inside the folder that we have created 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:36.100
 we go to the property option 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:38.560
 we open properties do not leave 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:42.190
 properties of our folder and we 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:45.730
 let's go to the share tab inside 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:50.530
 to share we are going to shared 

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:55.050
 has advanced we click on it and we mark 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:59.640
 the option to share this folder 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:02:03.750
 below on the permissions button we are going to 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:06.840
 granting permissions to this folder is 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:09.450
 so we can by default come as read 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:12.510
 that is let's allow others 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:15.120
 teams can only see the content of 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:18.450
 that folder can not copy it or 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:22.920
 cut it or delete it if we mark the 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:25.770
 option to change let's allow that 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:28.590
 other teams can see and change 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:31.590
 the contents of that folder and if 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:33.630
 we press in total control what we are going to 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:36.270
 do is give you total control of the 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:39.210
 files from that folder to the rest of 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:41.000
 that is, they will be able to do what 

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:42.390
 who want with the files that we have 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.820
 shared 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:46.740
 let's leave it in total control and 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:49.740
 we accept 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:52.290
 well again in the share tab 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:56.910
 what we are going to do is press the button 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:59.520
 of sharing let's choose the people 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:03.000
 the teams with which to share the 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:06.000
 content of this folder we begin in 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:10.070
 a home network a work group in 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:13.950
 my case I have four computers connected 

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:16.650
 a computer with xp an android device 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:18.990
 an android tablet and a playstation 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:23.280
 we are going to select that all 

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:27.240
 the computers of said network have access 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:29.400
 to this folder we can discriminate between 

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:31.530
 teams select one allows denying to 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.930
 but we're going to do it to 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:38.550
 all the computers in the folder in the 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:40.170
 we open it and look for the 

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:42.900
 equipment that we have at that time 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:44.730
 connected in our home network 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:47.130
 I'm going to select all and it's 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:50.730
 allow you access to all equipment 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:53.120
 to connect and click on Add 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:58.190
 we see how in the picture we already have 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:04:00.480
 added all in the drop-down we're going to 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:02.820
 confirm it so you can read and 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:04.250
 write is to say so you can do 

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:08.100
 what you want with all the files 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:10.019
 click on share and let us know 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:13.050
 that our folder is shared 

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:14.650
 within our home network we press 

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:16.900
 in ready 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:19.120
 and we close the box and we have 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:20.440
 our shared folder and now what 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:23.020
 what we have to do is verify that 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:26.080
 we can access it and its files 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:28.919
 from another device for example in the 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:31.840
 next video from a nexus 5 

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:34.470
 using the application is file 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:34.470
