 He speaks of July definitely a product 

00:00:18.509 --> 00:00:24.220
 addressed to the company and the 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:26.820
 ultrabook that hides some 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:28.480
 particularly features 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.849
 interesting 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:34.660
 despite being an ultrabook we talk about two 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:36.880
 different sizes and 72 40 and with 12.5 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:40.150
 inch and then we also have the version 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:42.970
 14 inches that the 74 40 me while being 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:44.110
 of an ultrabook hides some gods 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:46.390
 feature features 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:48.550
 typically business is beginning 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:50.860
 from the physical docking station attack that 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:53.230
 among other things, this is a flower 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:55.030
 in the buttonhole of dell maintains a 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:57.910
 backward compatibility with all docking 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:00.490
 family station series is latitude 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:02.140
 and therefore already exist for about four 

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:04.839
 years now 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:06.700
 another element to note with a 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:07.450
 particular attention is the battery 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.400
 extractable 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:12.490
 under this chassey you can hide 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:15.130
 a 3 to 1 to 4 cells of 3 cells has one 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:16.659
 autonomy close to 10 hours 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:19.090
 and this also thanks to optimization 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:21.370
 made by fourth processors 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:25.510
 intel generation that we succeed in 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:27.670
 mount i3 i5 i7 is a product from 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:31.120
 remarkable performance as it is 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:33.250
 also notable work done around 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:36.850
 to the concept of duel robustness 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:38.500
 ability we were able to integrate one 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:41.260
 certification that until recently was 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:43.330
 present only on rugged notebooks 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:45.940
 semi rugged that the certification e 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:48.820
 military standard 810g in protection 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:51.220
 from impacts high dust temperatures 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:53.860
 in short, a very very robust product 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:55.780
 in a nutshell it is always continuing 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.250
 in the technical specifications there are two 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:59.320
 versions of these products 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:01.930
 the first is a non- touchscreen version 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:03.480
 which is a colored aluminum body 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:06.870

 and in this case the external part of the 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:23.700
 cover turns black in carbon fiber 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.550
 rubberized material also very pleasant 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.050
 at the touch 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:30.420
 always on this product on the family 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:33.360

 which allows a wireless connection 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:41.420
 according to the most common standards 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:45.720
 used by the wireless world then 802 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:47.790
 ign and among other things is always available

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:59.510
 therefore a very complete product very much 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:03:03.019
 robust 3 usb ports on board 3.0 we have 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:05.510
 the LAN RJ45 to connect it easily 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:06.890
 without any type of adapter the doors 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:10.010
 they are full size so no need 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:12.530
 of any kind of angle and we have 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:14.190
 also an hdmi video output that is 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:16.590
 certainly 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:19.460
