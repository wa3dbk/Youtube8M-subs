contamination<00:02:36.390> is<00:02:36.570> to<00:02:36.960> start<00:02:37.290> with<00:02:37.470> the

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
contamination is to start with the

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:28.080 
die-cut itself and I I really like to do

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:30.350 
die-cut itself and I I really like to do
that<00:03:28.260> too<00:03:28.500> if<00:03:28.739> you<00:03:29.190> make<00:03:29.370> the<00:03:29.550> die-cut<00:03:29.910> wet<00:03:30.120> and

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 
that too if you make the die-cut wet and

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.810 
that too if you make the die-cut wet and
it<00:03:30.540> will<00:03:30.660> take<00:03:30.930> in<00:03:31.140> last<00:03:31.470> ink<00:03:31.890> and<00:03:32.340> again<00:03:32.640> the

it will take in last ink and again the
ink<00:03:33.030> will<00:03:33.270> blend<00:03:33.600> more<00:03:33.900> easily<00:03:34.440> and<00:03:34.650> will

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:34.800 
ink will blend more easily and will

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:37.640 
ink will blend more easily and will
travel<00:03:35.130> a<00:03:35.250> little<00:03:35.459> further<00:03:35.989> as<00:03:36.989> I<00:03:37.200> press<00:03:37.440> down

travel a little further as I press down
onto<00:03:37.920> the<00:03:38.070> die-cut<00:03:38.550> you<00:03:38.670> can<00:03:38.820> see<00:03:39.030> the<00:03:39.180> ink

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:39.420 
onto the die-cut you can see the ink

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.390 
onto the die-cut you can see the ink

check if you liked the result here I
instantly<00:03:47.250> have<00:03:47.610> a<00:03:47.640> few<00:03:48.000> spots<00:03:48.269> of<00:03:48.570> different

that didn't pick any color at all this

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.640 
that didn't pick any color at all this
happened<00:03:54.209> due<00:03:54.390> to<00:03:54.420> the<00:03:54.540> heat<00:03:54.810> embossing<00:03:55.110> the

happened due to the heat embossing the
raised<00:03:55.890> edges<00:03:56.220> prevented<00:03:57.120> ink<00:03:57.300> from

raised edges prevented ink from

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.750 
raised edges prevented ink from
travelling<00:03:58.080> everywhere<00:03:58.230> if<00:03:59.010> your<00:03:59.250> docket<00:03:59.580> was

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 
travelling everywhere if your docket was

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:01.640 
travelling everywhere if your docket was
stamped<00:04:00.330> and<00:04:00.450> not<00:04:00.600> heat<00:04:00.870> emboss<00:04:01.170> the<00:04:01.470> ink

stamped and not heat emboss the ink

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:02.960 
stamped and not heat emboss the ink
would<00:04:01.890> have<00:04:02.010> covered<00:04:02.340> it<00:04:02.489> better<00:04:02.700> and<00:04:02.880> would

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
would have covered it better and would

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:05.270 
would have covered it better and would
have<00:04:03.060> traveled<00:04:03.480> further<00:04:03.750> now<00:04:04.709> I<00:04:04.739> think<00:04:05.130> that

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
have traveled further now I think that

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.400 
have traveled further now I think that
this<00:04:05.400> looks<00:04:05.670> great<00:04:05.910> as<00:04:06.239> is<00:04:06.510> but<00:04:06.989> I<00:04:07.050> want<00:04:07.230> to<00:04:07.290> add

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.410 
this looks great as is but I want to add

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:09.229 
this looks great as is but I want to add
some<00:04:07.650> more<00:04:07.800> color<00:04:07.860> so<00:04:08.519> I'm<00:04:08.580> going<00:04:08.820> to<00:04:08.880> press

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:09.239 
some more color so I'm going to press

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:11.540 
some more color so I'm going to press
this<00:04:09.870> die-cut<00:04:10.080> onto<00:04:10.560> my<00:04:10.680> clear<00:04:10.980> block<00:04:11.190> again

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:11.550 
this die-cut onto my clear block again

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:13.490 
this die-cut onto my clear block again
onto<00:04:11.880> the<00:04:12.209> areas<00:04:12.540> where<00:04:12.720> I<00:04:12.750> still<00:04:13.080> have<00:04:13.260> some

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.500 
onto the areas where I still have some

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.830 
onto the areas where I still have some
ink<00:04:13.730> don't<00:04:14.730> be<00:04:14.820> afraid<00:04:15.120> to<00:04:15.239> do<00:04:15.330> that<00:04:15.450> if<00:04:15.720> you

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 
ink don't be afraid to do that if you

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.509 
ink don't be afraid to do that if you
mess<00:04:16.049> it<00:04:16.230> up<00:04:16.320> you<00:04:16.380> still<00:04:16.859> have<00:04:17.040> some<00:04:17.220> spare

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:17.519 
mess it up you still have some spare

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:19.310 
mess it up you still have some spare
die-cuts<00:04:17.970> and<00:04:18.209> you<00:04:18.269> can<00:04:18.419> always<00:04:18.840> start<00:04:19.140> over

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:19.320 
die-cuts and you can always start over

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:21.080 
die-cuts and you can always start over
this<00:04:19.859> is<00:04:20.070> sort<00:04:20.370> of<00:04:20.430> like<00:04:20.549> a<00:04:20.609> watercolor

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:21.090 
this is sort of like a watercolor

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:22.790 
this is sort of like a watercolor
technique<00:04:21.690> without<00:04:22.140> the<00:04:22.289> use<00:04:22.410> of<00:04:22.440> any

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:22.800 
technique without the use of any

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.310 
technique without the use of any
watercolor<00:04:23.250> mediums<00:04:23.880> I<00:04:24.120> actually<00:04:24.750> think<00:04:25.169> I

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:25.320 
watercolor mediums I actually think I

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:26.990 
watercolor mediums I actually think I
spent<00:04:25.680> like<00:04:25.770> an<00:04:25.979> hour<00:04:26.130> and<00:04:26.400> a<00:04:26.460> half

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 
spent like an hour and a half

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.640 
spent like an hour and a half
playing<00:04:27.270> with<00:04:27.450> my<00:04:27.570> butterfly<00:04:27.840> die-cuts<00:04:28.410> and

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:28.650 
playing with my butterfly die-cuts and

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:31.130 
playing with my butterfly die-cuts and
all<00:04:28.830> new<00:04:29.070> inks<00:04:29.610> experimenting<00:04:30.450> and<00:04:30.720> mixing

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:31.140 
all new inks experimenting and mixing

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:33.170 
all new inks experimenting and mixing
colors<00:04:31.610> actually<00:04:32.610> ended<00:04:32.880> up<00:04:32.970> mixing

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:33.180 
colors actually ended up mixing

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:35.390 
colors actually ended up mixing
different<00:04:33.750> colors<00:04:34.020> too<00:04:34.320> I<00:04:34.560> was<00:04:34.740> trying<00:04:35.040> to<00:04:35.130> see

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:35.400 
different colors too I was trying to see

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.490 
different colors too I was trying to see
how<00:04:35.610> that<00:04:35.850> will<00:04:36.000> work<00:04:36.240> it<00:04:36.660> didn't<00:04:37.230> work<00:04:37.350> how

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:37.500 
how that will work it didn't work how

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:39.440 
how that will work it didn't work how
well<00:04:37.770> but<00:04:38.310> I'm<00:04:38.520> glad<00:04:38.670> I<00:04:38.790> tried

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:39.450 
well but I'm glad I tried

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:41.870 
well but I'm glad I tried
now<00:04:40.440> as<00:04:40.590> you<00:04:40.710> add<00:04:40.830> color<00:04:41.070> to<00:04:41.220> your<00:04:41.400> die-cuts

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:41.880 
now as you add color to your die-cuts

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:43.490 
now as you add color to your die-cuts
and<00:04:42.060> if<00:04:42.210> you<00:04:42.330> feel<00:04:42.570> you<00:04:42.750> do<00:04:42.840> not<00:04:42.960> have<00:04:43.200> enough

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:43.500 
and if you feel you do not have enough

more water and press your die-cut onto

more water and press your die-cut onto
the<00:04:47.370> clear<00:04:47.610> puddle<00:04:47.940> again<00:04:48.210> and<00:04:48.480> pick<00:04:48.630> up<00:04:48.780> some

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:10.050 
to try this you don't have to use a

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:12.200 
to try this you don't have to use a
butterfly<00:05:10.500> try<00:05:10.890> some<00:05:11.100> flowers<00:05:11.610> try<00:05:12.000> some

leaves<00:05:12.480> some<00:05:13.350> other<00:05:13.500> images<00:05:13.919> too<00:05:14.160> you're

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:14.460 
leaves some other images too you're

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:16.730 
leaves some other images too you're
going<00:05:14.820> to<00:05:14.970> love<00:05:15.330> this<00:05:15.540> technique<00:05:15.960> you<00:05:16.590> can

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:16.740 
going to love this technique you can

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:18.440 
going to love this technique you can
even<00:05:17.130> do<00:05:17.280> this<00:05:17.460> vice<00:05:17.700> versa

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:18.450 
even do this vice versa

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:20.659 
even do this vice versa
first<00:05:18.900> by<00:05:19.260> creating<00:05:19.320> a<00:05:19.800> colorful<00:05:20.190> background

00:05:20.659 --> 00:05:20.669 
first by creating a colorful background

00:05:20.669 --> 00:05:22.610 
first by creating a colorful background
and<00:05:21.000> then<00:05:21.330> by<00:05:21.510> stamping<00:05:22.110> and<00:05:22.260> die-cutting

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:22.620 
and then by stamping and die-cutting

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:24.560 
and then by stamping and die-cutting
your<00:05:22.830> images<00:05:23.220> just<00:05:24.000> make<00:05:24.150> sure<00:05:24.360> your

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:24.570 
your images just make sure your

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:26.330 
your images just make sure your
background<00:05:25.080> is<00:05:25.230> dry<00:05:25.500> before<00:05:25.980> you<00:05:26.100> see

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:26.340 
background is dry before you see

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:28.280 
background is dry before you see
anything<00:05:26.700> on<00:05:26.970> to<00:05:27.180> it<00:05:27.300> and<00:05:27.419> before<00:05:27.600> you<00:05:27.810> cut<00:05:28.169> it

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:28.290 
anything on to it and before you cut it

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:30.470 
anything on to it and before you cut it
and<00:05:28.650> this<00:05:29.100> way<00:05:29.310> you<00:05:29.370> won't<00:05:29.669> even<00:05:29.850> need<00:05:30.120> to<00:05:30.300> use

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:30.480 
and this way you won't even need to use

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:33.409 
and this way you won't even need to use
waterproof<00:05:31.080> ink<00:05:31.490> so<00:05:32.490> for<00:05:32.669> my<00:05:32.760> next<00:05:32.790> butterfly

00:05:33.409 --> 00:05:33.419 
waterproof ink so for my next butterfly

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:35.600 
waterproof ink so for my next butterfly
I<00:05:33.600> used<00:05:33.810> yellow<00:05:34.140> inks<00:05:34.770> from<00:05:34.979> altenew<00:05:35.250> and

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:35.610 
I used yellow inks from altenew and

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:37.760 
I used yellow inks from altenew and
basically<00:05:36.060> did<00:05:36.240> the<00:05:36.270> same<00:05:36.630> thing<00:05:36.930> add<00:05:37.260> a<00:05:37.440> color

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:37.770 
basically did the same thing add a color

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:39.740 
basically did the same thing add a color
to<00:05:37.860> my<00:05:38.130> clear<00:05:38.370> block<00:05:38.640> added<00:05:39.540> water

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:39.750 
to my clear block added water

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:42.530 
to my clear block added water
transferred<00:05:40.560> ink<00:05:40.770> onto<00:05:41.010> the<00:05:41.190> die-cut<00:05:41.700> I<00:05:41.910> also

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:42.540 
transferred ink onto the die-cut I also

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:44.690 
transferred ink onto the die-cut I also
did<00:05:42.840> a<00:05:42.870> green<00:05:43.229> butterfly<00:05:43.740> and<00:05:44.070> a<00:05:44.250> not<00:05:44.490> so

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:44.700 
did a green butterfly and a not so

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:46.880 
did a green butterfly and a not so
pretty<00:05:44.910> pink<00:05:45.390> and<00:05:45.630> yellow<00:05:45.900> and<00:05:46.229> green<00:05:46.440> one<00:05:46.680> I

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:46.890 
pretty pink and yellow and green one I

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:48.560 
pretty pink and yellow and green one I
was<00:05:47.220> trying<00:05:47.340> to<00:05:47.520> see<00:05:47.760> if<00:05:47.880> those<00:05:48.090> would<00:05:48.330> work

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:48.570 
was trying to see if those would work

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:49.600 
was trying to see if those would work
well<00:05:48.810> together

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:49.610 
well together

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:52.040 
well together
obviously<00:05:50.610> pink<00:05:51.000> did<00:05:51.270> not<00:05:51.479> agree<00:05:51.720> with<00:05:51.810> the

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:52.050 
obviously pink did not agree with the

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:53.750 
obviously pink did not agree with the
rest<00:05:52.290> of<00:05:52.500> the<00:05:52.560> colors<00:05:52.890> and<00:05:53.220> it<00:05:53.340> ended<00:05:53.640> up

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:53.760 
rest of the colors and it ended up

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:57.080 
rest of the colors and it ended up
looking<00:05:53.940> one<00:05:54.540> big<00:05:55.050> mess<00:05:55.470> there<00:05:55.820> so<00:05:56.820> I<00:05:56.850> then

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:57.090 
looking one big mess there so I then

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:59.030 
looking one big mess there so I then
said<00:05:57.360> my<00:05:57.510> butterflies<00:05:57.960> aside<00:05:58.410> and<00:05:58.680> started

00:05:59.030 --> 00:05:59.040 
said my butterflies aside and started

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:00.920 
said my butterflies aside and started
working<00:05:59.460> on<00:05:59.610> my<00:05:59.880> background<00:06:00.150> forward<00:06:00.810> my

of like a fuller background I don't know
it<00:06:34.830> just<00:06:34.919> felt<00:06:35.160> better<00:06:35.490> with<00:06:35.820> the<00:06:36.000> alternating

00:06:36.589 --> 00:06:36.599 
it just felt better with the alternating

it just felt better with the alternating
upside-down<00:06:37.169> lines<00:06:37.620> I<00:06:37.970> also<00:06:38.970> connected<00:06:39.419> the

pretty now I know a lot of people do not

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:56.280 
pretty now I know a lot of people do not
like<00:06:54.760> bold<00:06:55.090> backgrounds<00:06:55.630> like<00:06:55.780> this<00:06:56.020> if

00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:56.290 
like bold backgrounds like this if

00:06:56.290 --> 00:06:58.470 
like bold backgrounds like this if
you're<00:06:56.530> one<00:06:56.740> of<00:06:56.860> those<00:06:56.950> people<00:06:57.220> then<00:06:58.150> try

00:06:58.470 --> 00:06:58.480 
you're one of those people then try

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:01.020 
you're one of those people then try
using<00:06:58.540> a<00:06:58.990> non<00:06:59.230> black<00:06:59.590> ink<00:06:59.950> so<00:07:00.460> if<00:07:00.670> I<00:07:00.790> were<00:07:00.970> to

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:01.030 
using a non black ink so if I were to

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:03.210 
using a non black ink so if I were to
add<00:07:01.300> a<00:07:01.330> hot<00:07:01.660> pink<00:07:01.930> butterfly<00:07:02.410> to<00:07:02.470> this<00:07:02.680> card<00:07:03.010> I

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:03.220 
add a hot pink butterfly to this card I

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:05.370 
add a hot pink butterfly to this card I
would<00:07:03.430> use<00:07:03.610> a<00:07:03.640> frost<00:07:04.270> pink<00:07:04.600> ink<00:07:04.870> from<00:07:05.110> altenew

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:05.380 
would use a frost pink ink from altenew

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:07.080 
would use a frost pink ink from altenew
to<00:07:05.740> stamp<00:07:05.980> the<00:07:06.100> background<00:07:06.490> this<00:07:06.760> is<00:07:06.820> the

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:07.090 
to stamp the background this is the

00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:08.910 
to stamp the background this is the
lightest<00:07:07.540> pink<00:07:07.720> that<00:07:07.990> they<00:07:08.110> have<00:07:08.350> it<00:07:08.680> would

00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:08.920 
lightest pink that they have it would

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:11.420 
lightest pink that they have it would
look<00:07:09.040> very<00:07:09.430> nice<00:07:09.670> but<00:07:10.030> not<00:07:10.210> nearly<00:07:10.540> as<00:07:10.720> bold<00:07:11.170> I

00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:11.430 
look very nice but not nearly as bold I

00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:14.190 
look very nice but not nearly as bold I
also<00:07:12.430> decided<00:07:12.880> I<00:07:13.090> needed<00:07:13.300> to<00:07:13.450> die<00:07:13.660> cut<00:07:13.900> a<00:07:13.930> few

00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:14.200 
also decided I needed to die cut a few

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:16.140 
also decided I needed to die cut a few
butterflies<00:07:14.620> out<00:07:14.800> of<00:07:14.980> Vow<00:07:15.190> um<00:07:15.400> I<00:07:15.610> did<00:07:16.000> not

butterflies out of Vow um I did not

00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:18.120 
butterflies out of Vow um I did not
stamp<00:07:16.480> for<00:07:16.660> the<00:07:16.720> images<00:07:17.110> I<00:07:17.260> only<00:07:17.530> cut<00:07:17.950> the

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:18.130 
stamp for the images I only cut the

00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:20.100 
stamp for the images I only cut the
shapes<00:07:18.370> out<00:07:18.580> I<00:07:18.910> use<00:07:19.480> these<00:07:19.720> to<00:07:19.930> create

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:20.110 
shapes out I use these to create

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:22.170 
shapes out I use these to create
multi-layered<00:07:21.100> embellishments<00:07:21.940> for<00:07:22.060> my

00:07:22.170 --> 00:07:22.180
