gonna be teaching you how to create a

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:06.200 
gonna be teaching you how to create a
multi-tool<00:00:04.529> in<00:00:04.740> Minecraft<00:00:05.400> console<00:00:05.819> versions

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:06.210 
multi-tool in Minecraft console versions

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:08.030 
multi-tool in Minecraft console versions
that<00:00:06.509> can<00:00:06.629> be<00:00:06.720> used<00:00:06.870> as<00:00:07.049> a<00:00:07.080> shovel<00:00:07.500> so<00:00:07.799> you<00:00:07.859> can

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
that can be used as a shovel so you can

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:09.890 
that can be used as a shovel so you can
shovel<00:00:08.309> dirt<00:00:08.550> really<00:00:09.059> quickly<00:00:09.389> can<00:00:09.690> be<00:00:09.780> used

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
shovel dirt really quickly can be used

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:10.910 
shovel dirt really quickly can be used
as<00:00:09.990> an<00:00:10.080> axe<00:00:10.290> so<00:00:10.410> you<00:00:10.500> can<00:00:10.590> chop<00:00:10.740> down<00:00:10.860> trees

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
as an axe so you can chop down trees

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.709 
as an axe so you can chop down trees
really<00:00:11.309> quickly<00:00:11.580> and<00:00:11.759> as<00:00:12.030> well<00:00:12.269> as<00:00:12.360> that<00:00:12.540> it

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
really quickly and as well as that it

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:14.330 
really quickly and as well as that it
also<00:00:12.840> functions<00:00:13.170> ashes<00:00:13.860> so<00:00:14.070> if<00:00:14.130> you<00:00:14.190> need<00:00:14.309> to

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
also functions ashes so if you need to

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.070 
also functions ashes so if you need to
share<00:00:14.549> something<00:00:14.820> you<00:00:15.389> can<00:00:15.480> do<00:00:15.570> that<00:00:15.719> or<00:00:15.900> you

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
share something you can do that or you

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.720 
share something you can do that or you
can<00:00:16.199> chop<00:00:16.379> down<00:00:16.590> wall<00:00:16.830> really<00:00:17.340> really<00:00:17.490> fast

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
can chop down wall really really fast

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.310 
can chop down wall really really fast
and<00:00:17.940> on<00:00:18.359> top<00:00:18.539> of<00:00:18.630> doing<00:00:18.720> all<00:00:18.930> those<00:00:19.109> free

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
and on top of doing all those free

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.890 
and on top of doing all those free
things<00:00:19.529> in<00:00:19.710> one<00:00:19.949> it<00:00:20.160> has<00:00:20.369> unlimited

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:20.900 
things in one it has unlimited

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:22.790 
things in one it has unlimited
durability<00:00:21.900> that's<00:00:22.109> that<00:00:22.260> right<00:00:22.410> it<00:00:22.650> will

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
durability that's that right it will

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.189 
durability that's that right it will
never<00:00:23.189> ever<00:00:23.460> go<00:00:23.910> broken<00:00:24.359> which<00:00:24.660> is<00:00:24.779> absolutely

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
never ever go broken which is absolutely

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.140 
never ever go broken which is absolutely
insane<00:00:25.350> so<00:00:25.769> this<00:00:26.220> works<00:00:26.430> for<00:00:26.580> any<00:00:26.699> Minecraft

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
insane so this works for any Minecraft

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.759 
insane so this works for any Minecraft
console<00:00:27.480> that<00:00:27.599> has<00:00:27.660> anvils<00:00:28.140> and<00:00:28.320> enchanted

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
console that has anvils and enchanted

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.410 
console that has anvils and enchanted
books<00:00:28.949> aka<00:00:29.310> all<00:00:29.580> of<00:00:29.670> them<00:00:29.849> so<00:00:30.150> let's<00:00:30.300> show<00:00:30.390> you

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
books aka all of them so let's show you

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:31.640 
books aka all of them so let's show you
have<00:00:30.599> to<00:00:30.750> listen<00:00:30.990> so<00:00:31.140> the<00:00:31.260> first<00:00:31.410> thing<00:00:31.529> you'll

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
have to listen so the first thing you'll

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.290 
have to listen so the first thing you'll
do<00:00:31.859> is<00:00:32.040> get<00:00:32.250> yourself<00:00:32.340> some<00:00:32.700> inefficiency<00:00:32.880> for

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
do is get yourself some inefficiency for

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.420 
do is get yourself some inefficiency for
enchanted<00:00:34.020> books<00:00:34.260> so<00:00:34.590> you<00:00:34.800> can't<00:00:35.280> actually

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
enchanted books so you can't actually

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.130 
enchanted books so you can't actually
enchant<00:00:35.940> shares<00:00:36.270> directly<00:00:36.480> if<00:00:36.840> you<00:00:36.899> try<00:00:37.079> to

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
enchant shares directly if you try to

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.270 
enchant shares directly if you try to
put<00:00:37.230> them<00:00:37.290> in<00:00:37.380> there<00:00:37.530> you<00:00:37.680> don't<00:00:37.950> get<00:00:38.129> anything

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
put them in there you don't get anything

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.040 
put them in there you don't get anything
so<00:00:38.879> you<00:00:38.969> need<00:00:39.090> to<00:00:39.180> put<00:00:39.300> books<00:00:39.510> in<00:00:39.690> there<00:00:39.840> and

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
so you need to put books in there and

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.569 
so you need to put books in there and
keep<00:00:40.260> on<00:00:40.410> enchanting<00:00:40.920> with<00:00:41.010> level<00:00:41.219> 13

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
keep on enchanting with level 13

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.010 
keep on enchanting with level 13
shamans'<00:00:41.850> and<00:00:42.239> to<00:00:42.390> eventually<00:00:42.809> you<00:00:42.899> get

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
shamans' and to eventually you get

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.779 
shamans' and to eventually you get
efficiency<00:00:43.379> fought<00:00:43.710> twice<00:00:43.920> it's<00:00:44.489> gonna<00:00:44.610> take

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
efficiency fought twice it's gonna take

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.310 
efficiency fought twice it's gonna take
some<00:00:44.940> time<00:00:44.969> but<00:00:45.390> it's<00:00:45.539> gonna<00:00:45.719> be<00:00:45.809> worth<00:00:46.050> it

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
some time but it's gonna be worth it

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.900 
some time but it's gonna be worth it
because<00:00:46.649> I<00:00:46.920> want<00:00:47.100> you<00:00:47.190> get<00:00:47.280> efficiency<00:00:47.640> for

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
because I want you get efficiency for

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.670 
because I want you get efficiency for
you<00:00:48.120> go<00:00:48.270> to<00:00:48.390> an<00:00:48.480> anvil<00:00:48.629> and<00:00:48.870> you<00:00:49.079> put<00:00:49.289> that<00:00:49.469> on

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
you go to an anvil and you put that on

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.889 
you go to an anvil and you put that on
your<00:00:50.190> so<00:00:50.579> once<00:00:51.149> you<00:00:51.239> have<00:00:51.329> efficiency

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
your so once you have efficiency

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.540 
your so once you have efficiency
fought<00:00:52.110> on<00:00:52.289> your<00:00:52.440> shares<00:00:52.739> then<00:00:53.070> you<00:00:53.190> have<00:00:53.370> the

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
fought on your shares then you have the

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:54.290 
fought on your shares then you have the
multi<00:00:53.940> tools

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
multi tools

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.119 
multi tools
so<00:00:54.449> those<00:00:54.989> things<00:00:55.110> absolutely<00:00:55.680> incredible

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
so those things absolutely incredible

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:57.590 
so those things absolutely incredible
because<00:00:56.309> if<00:00:56.610> you<00:00:56.760> are<00:00:56.910> looking<00:00:57.149> and<00:00:57.390> this<00:00:57.480> is

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
because if you are looking and this is

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.360 
because if you are looking and this is
how<00:00:57.719> fast<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:58.050> kind<00:00:58.260> of<00:00:58.289> straight<00:00:58.559> dirt<00:00:58.770> I'll

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
how fast the kind of straight dirt I'll

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:00.709 
how fast the kind of straight dirt I'll
play<00:00:59.699> over<00:00:59.730> to<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.030> trees<00:01:00.270> over<00:01:00.480> there<00:01:00.539> and

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
play over to the trees over there and

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.119 
play over to the trees over there and
show<00:01:00.809> you<00:01:00.870> how<00:01:00.989> but<00:01:01.140> quickly<00:01:01.350> can<00:01:01.590> do<00:01:01.710> that<00:01:01.859> and

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
show you how but quickly can do that and

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.100 
show you how but quickly can do that and
yeah<00:01:02.550> this<00:01:02.699> entirely<00:01:03.030> works<00:01:03.300> in<00:01:03.510> survival<00:01:03.960> too

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
yeah this entirely works in survival too

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.690 
yeah this entirely works in survival too
which<00:01:04.260> is<00:01:04.409> just<00:01:04.439> insane<00:01:04.949> and<00:01:05.129> as<00:01:05.400> you<00:01:05.460> can<00:01:05.519> see

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
which is just insane and as you can see

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.070 
which is just insane and as you can see
as<00:01:05.850> I'm<00:01:05.970> doing<00:01:06.150> wolf<00:01:06.299> this<00:01:06.479> besides<00:01:06.900> when<00:01:07.049> I

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
as I'm doing wolf this besides when I

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.750 
as I'm doing wolf this besides when I
just<00:01:07.290> dropped<00:01:07.439> down<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.560> tree<00:01:07.830> at<00:01:08.010> least<00:01:08.430> just

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
just dropped down the tree at least just

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:09.830 
just dropped down the tree at least just
there<00:01:08.939> because<00:01:09.150> that's<00:01:09.240> the<00:01:09.420> one<00:01:09.540> thing<00:01:09.689> that

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
there because that's the one thing that

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.149 
there because that's the one thing that
takes<00:01:09.930> your<00:01:10.080> bility<00:01:10.439> everything<00:01:11.010> besides

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
takes your bility everything besides

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.640 
takes your bility everything besides
leafs<00:01:11.700> and<00:01:12.090> actually<00:01:12.720> shearing<00:01:13.049> sheep<00:01:13.290> will

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
leafs and actually shearing sheep will

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.230 
leafs and actually shearing sheep will
not<00:01:13.830> take<00:01:14.010> away<00:01:14.189> any<00:01:14.430> G<00:01:14.670> ability<00:01:14.970> from<00:01:15.030> this

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
not take away any G ability from this

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.490 
not take away any G ability from this
thing<00:01:15.390> so<00:01:15.630> as<00:01:15.750> you<00:01:15.810> can<00:01:15.930> see<00:01:16.080> even<00:01:16.229> if<00:01:16.409> I'm

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
thing so as you can see even if I'm

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.020 
thing so as you can see even if I'm
going<00:01:16.680> to<00:01:16.770> go<00:01:16.860> insane<00:01:17.310> go<00:01:17.369> this<00:01:17.729> way<00:01:17.880> it<00:01:17.970> will

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
going to go insane go this way it will

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.940 
going to go insane go this way it will
where<00:01:18.210> one<00:01:18.390> you<00:01:18.900> can<00:01:19.020> do<00:01:19.140> that<00:01:19.290> so<00:01:19.590> this<00:01:19.770> is<00:01:19.830> the

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
where one you can do that so this is the

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.950 
where one you can do that so this is the
multitude<00:01:20.280> already<00:01:20.610> but<00:01:21.000> this<00:01:21.479> can<00:01:21.780> be

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
multitude already but this can be

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.840 
multitude already but this can be
improved<00:01:22.380> one<00:01:22.619> step<00:01:22.890> further<00:01:23.100> so<00:01:23.400> how<00:01:23.610> can<00:01:23.670> you

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
improved one step further so how can you

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.700 
improved one step further so how can you
do<00:01:23.970> that<00:01:24.090> because<00:01:24.330> you<00:01:24.840> got<00:01:25.080> what<00:01:25.380> you<00:01:25.409> can<00:01:25.590> do

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
do that because you got what you can do

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.440 
do that because you got what you can do
is<00:01:25.860> if<00:01:25.950> you<00:01:26.040> have<00:01:26.400> second<00:01:26.759> deficiency<00:01:27.270> poor

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
is if you have second deficiency poor

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:27.800 
is if you have second deficiency poor
thing

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
thing

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.080 
thing
or<00:01:28.020> you<00:01:28.140> can<00:01:28.290> throw<00:01:28.470> this<00:01:28.650> into<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:29.549> trauma

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
or you can throw this into the trauma

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.719 
or you can throw this into the trauma
table<00:01:30.450> and<00:01:30.570> get<00:01:30.930> efficiency<00:01:31.500> five<00:01:32.009> shares

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
table and get efficiency five shares

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.060 
table and get efficiency five shares
that's<00:01:33.119> right<00:01:33.390> efficiency<00:01:33.720> five<00:01:34.380> you

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
that's right efficiency five you

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.230 
that's right efficiency five you
can<00:01:35.189> even<00:01:35.340> name<00:01:35.430> them<00:01:35.579> if<00:01:35.700> you<00:01:35.759> want<00:01:35.909> like<00:01:36.060> the

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
can even name them if you want like the

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.179 
can even name them if you want like the
ultimate<00:01:36.689> tool<00:01:36.869> and<00:01:37.049> this<00:01:37.409> means<00:01:37.619> you'll

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
ultimate tool and this means you'll

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.069 
ultimate tool and this means you'll
actually<00:01:38.310> be<00:01:38.460> mining<00:01:38.790> faster<00:01:39.720> than<00:01:39.869> any

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
actually be mining faster than any

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:41.600 
actually be mining faster than any
shovel<00:01:40.500> possibly<00:01:41.009> which<00:01:41.159> I'm<00:01:41.280> not<00:01:41.400> trees

top of that no TT as you can see it just

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.649 
top of that no TT as you can see it just
ends<00:01:45.990> two<00:01:46.140> going<00:01:46.439> and<00:01:46.909> as<00:01:47.909> well<00:01:48.360> as<00:01:48.450> you<00:01:48.570> know

you on screen how long it takes to mind

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.100 
you on screen how long it takes to mind
with<00:02:02.759> anything<00:02:03.119> it<00:02:03.210> creative<00:02:03.540> you<00:02:04.020> can

actually go in survival and use this to

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.700 
actually go in survival and use this to
mind<00:02:05.969> faster<00:02:06.570> than<00:02:06.719> you<00:02:06.840> can<00:02:07.049> in<00:02:07.320> create<00:02:07.590> it

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
mind faster than you can in create it

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.410

that's<00:02:07.860> right<00:02:08.039> look<00:02:08.640> how<00:02:08.759> fast<00:02:09.000> you<00:02:09.179> can<00:02:09.300> do

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
that's right look how fast you can do

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:10.699 
that's right look how fast you can do
this<00:02:09.569> this<00:02:09.750> is<00:02:09.899> how<00:02:09.989> awesome<00:02:10.349> go<00:02:10.470> if<00:02:10.590> you

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
this this is how awesome go if you

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.589 
this this is how awesome go if you
sprint<00:02:11.009> and<00:02:11.129> flying<00:02:11.400> gasps<00:02:11.640> survive

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
sprint and flying gasps survive

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:14.360 
sprint and flying gasps survive
this<00:02:12.900> is<00:02:13.049> it's<00:02:13.319> just<00:02:13.379> it's<00:02:13.709> just<00:02:13.769> ridiculous

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
this is it's just it's just ridiculous

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:17.390 
this is it's just it's just ridiculous
like<00:02:15.290> again<00:02:16.290> this<00:02:16.440> is<00:02:16.620> entirely<00:02:16.920> survival

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
like again this is entirely survival

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:18.949 
like again this is entirely survival
just<00:02:17.519> for<00:02:17.700> the<00:02:17.940> I'm<00:02:18.090> using<00:02:18.239> flanker<00:02:18.720> images

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
just for the I'm using flanker images

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:23.539 
just for the I'm using flanker images
but<00:02:19.110> besides<00:02:19.349> that<00:02:19.440> this<00:02:19.769> is<00:02:19.950> survival<00:02:20.610> so<00:02:22.549> you

00:02:23.539 --> 00:02:23.549 
but besides that this is survival so you

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:25.490 
but besides that this is survival so you
can<00:02:23.700> mind<00:02:23.909> so<00:02:24.180> forth<00:02:24.480> it's<00:02:24.780> just<00:02:24.989> it's<00:02:25.200> so

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
can mind so forth it's just it's so

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.680 
can mind so forth it's just it's so
ridiculous<00:02:26.099> efficiency<00:02:26.489> 5<00:02:26.700> and<00:02:26.970> as<00:02:27.540> I<00:02:27.629> said

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
ridiculous efficiency 5 and as I said

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.649 
ridiculous efficiency 5 and as I said
