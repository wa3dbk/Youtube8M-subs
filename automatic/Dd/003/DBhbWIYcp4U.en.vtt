give<00:02:36.910> it<00:02:37.000> a<00:02:37.060> few<00:02:37.180> mixes<00:02:37.600> and<00:02:37.870> then<00:02:38.110> put<00:02:38.290> it<00:02:38.380> into

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
give it a few mixes and then put it into

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.560 
give it a few mixes and then put it into
a<00:02:38.560> piping<00:02:38.800> bag<00:02:39.190> and<00:02:39.220> reserve<00:02:39.850> until<00:02:40.030> ready<00:02:40.390> to

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:40.570 
a piping bag and reserve until ready to

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:52.290 
a piping bag and reserve until ready to
use

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:52.300 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:54.460 

all<00:02:53.300> right<00:02:53.420> so<00:02:53.570> once<00:02:53.750> the<00:02:53.840> ganache<00:02:54.050> is<00:02:54.290> done

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
all right so once the ganache is done

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:56.500 
all right so once the ganache is done
your<00:02:54.740> thin<00:02:55.010> mint<00:02:55.220> wafers<00:02:55.580> are<00:02:55.790> probably<00:02:56.240> ready

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
your thin mint wafers are probably ready

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:58.060 
your thin mint wafers are probably ready
to<00:02:56.630> go<00:02:56.780> so<00:02:57.230> pull<00:02:57.470> them<00:02:57.590> out<00:02:57.620> of<00:02:57.710> the<00:02:57.770> oven<00:02:57.860> let

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:58.070 
to go so pull them out of the oven let

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:59.770 
to go so pull them out of the oven let
them<00:02:58.370> cool<00:02:58.550> down<00:02:58.610> for<00:02:58.940> five<00:02:59.210> minutes<00:02:59.240> and<00:02:59.690> then

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
them cool down for five minutes and then

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.740 
them cool down for five minutes and then
put<00:02:59.930> them<00:03:00.080> onto<00:03:00.200> a<00:03:00.380> plate<00:03:00.440> and<00:03:00.860> set<00:03:01.520> them<00:03:01.640> aside

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
put them onto a plate and set them aside

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:05.050 
put them onto a plate and set them aside
now<00:03:02.750> it's<00:03:02.990> on<00:03:03.200> to<00:03:03.410> the<00:03:03.650> macaroons<00:03:04.190> so<00:03:04.820> in<00:03:04.970> a

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.060 
now it's on to the macaroons so in a

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:06.190 
now it's on to the macaroons so in a
small<00:03:05.300> bowl<00:03:05.510> you're<00:03:05.600> going<00:03:05.690> to<00:03:05.750> add<00:03:05.870> one<00:03:05.900> egg
