00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.390
 real coastal military with a 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:31.890
 impressive system of fortifications 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:35.120
 designed to withstand an air attack 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.120
 maritime and terrestrial 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:45.799
 this system of fortifications is unique 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.810
 in america and one of the few that remains 

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:50.030
 in the world since they were built 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:54.129
 thinking about resisting a world war 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:54.129
 and even an atomic war 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:00.980
 all these structures were 

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:03.430
 operational until the year 2000 and now they are 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:03.430

 Second World War waiting 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:13.690
 again perazzo 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:21.420
 hidden and protected by the jungle 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:24.530
 operators should attack batteries like 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:27.750
 this bunkers built underground 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:30.209
 solidly fortified in their corridors 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:34.549
 and underground runners the players

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:40.739
 it's an ajax where we have to destroy 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:42.750
 main objective factory 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:44.959
 chemical weapons you're not ready to 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:44.959
 after 

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:52.769
 I usually understand bolt you will spend in a 

00:03:50.219 --> 00:03:55.170
 instant of a fight in the jungle to 

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:57.569
 demanding tactical operations of that 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:59.219
 club and the team the entire bonus has 

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:00.719
 been working in recent months 

00:03:59.219 --> 00:04:02.549
 so that these buildings dating 

00:04:00.719 --> 00:04:04.500
 of the Second World War are 

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:05.550
 ready for a 100,000 experience 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:08.010
 dreams 

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:11.250
 here there are no wooden walls or 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:13.580
 playboy are real buildings ready to 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:13.580
 the fight 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:18.290
 in this area will be built the 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:20.269
 trenches that will protect the mortar and 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:23.379
 that mission key can 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:23.379
 and it must be destroyed 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:39.380
 on this beach will happen the atlantean mission 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:41.420
 where the amphibious commands and the 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:43.340
 combat divers will prepare a head 

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:45.700
 of beach that allows the advance of the 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:45.700
 own 

00:04:55.070 --> 00:05:00.860
 these bases were built for a 

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:03.980
 real war but never saw 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:06.569
 action in 50 years until now where 

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:09.210
 tree makes it possible 

00:05:06.569 --> 00:05:11.039
 only in operation where the other you 

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:13.649

00:05:13.649 --> 00:05:18.629
 complete 1000 experience without there 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:21.659
 lived because this is much more than a 

00:05:18.629 --> 00:05:24.659
 game is all set to make them 

00:05:21.659 --> 00:05:27.740
 feel as close as possible to a 

00:05:24.659 --> 00:05:27.740
 real war
