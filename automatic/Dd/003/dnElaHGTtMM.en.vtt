that<00:00:37.050> the<00:00:37.140> bezels<00:00:37.530> are<00:00:37.649> pretty<00:00:37.920> thin<00:00:38.190> so<00:00:38.579> if

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
that the bezels are pretty thin so if

accidentally hit the volume toggle but

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.090 
accidentally hit the volume toggle but
it's<00:00:42.480> easy<00:00:42.629> enough<00:00:42.780> to<00:00:42.960> hold<00:00:43.230> a<00:00:43.500> device<00:00:43.860> from

it's easy enough to hold a device from
the<00:00:44.160> bottom<00:00:44.550> we<00:00:45.120> also<00:00:45.270> liked<00:00:45.690> it<00:00:45.840> it<00:00:45.960> has<00:00:46.140> this

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
the bottom we also liked it it has this

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.920 
the bottom we also liked it it has this

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
kind of textured finish and this brown

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.090 
kind of textured finish and this brown
shade<00:00:49.260> it<00:00:49.440> adds<00:00:49.620> a<00:00:49.739> little<00:00:49.860> bit<00:00:50.010> of

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
shade it adds a little bit of

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.740

see<00:00:52.020> on<00:00:52.489> plastic<00:00:53.489> Galaxy<00:00:53.969> devices<00:00:54.120> and<00:00:54.719> if<00:00:55.230> we

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
see on plastic Galaxy devices and if we

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.350 
see on plastic Galaxy devices and if we
bring<00:00:55.590> in<00:00:55.710> the<00:00:55.800> galaxy<00:00:56.340> eight-point<00:00:56.820> note<00:00:57.120> 8.0

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
bring in the galaxy eight-point note 8.0

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.450 
bring in the galaxy eight-point note 8.0
you'll<00:00:58.140> see<00:00:58.350> that<00:00:58.500> this<00:00:58.649> really<00:00:59.010> is<00:00:59.160> a<00:00:59.190> much

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
you'll see that this really is a much

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.360 
you'll see that this really is a much
thinner<00:00:59.489> device<00:01:00.149> so<00:01:00.809> that's<00:01:01.020> what<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.590> tab<00:01:02.039> 3

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
thinner device so that's what the tab 3

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.460 
thinner device so that's what the tab 3
8<00:01:02.520> or<00:01:02.730> no<00:01:02.879> has<00:01:03.059> in<00:01:03.210> its<00:01:03.390> neighbour<00:01:03.629> another

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
8 or no has in its neighbour another
