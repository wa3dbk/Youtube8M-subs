much so it's nice to have a prop you
know<00:00:25.490> okay<00:00:26.490> so<00:00:26.519> the<00:00:26.789> time<00:00:27.029> machine<00:00:29.510> if

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
know okay so the time machine if

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.500 
know okay so the time machine if
directly<00:00:31.320> answering<00:00:32.040> that<00:00:32.130> question<00:00:32.309> the<00:00:33.239> two

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
directly answering that question the two

directly answering that question the two
color<00:00:33.989> multicolor<00:00:34.860> LED<00:00:35.370> that's<00:00:35.610> because

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
color multicolor LED that's because

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.490 
color multicolor LED that's because
there's<00:00:36.120> a<00:00:36.180> modern<00:00:36.540> mode<00:00:36.750> and<00:00:37.260> there's<00:00:37.440> a

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
there's a modern mode and there's a

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.860 
there's a modern mode and there's a
vintage<00:00:37.890> mode<00:00:38.129> the<00:00:38.820> modern<00:00:39.180> mode<00:00:39.360> is<00:00:39.540> what<00:00:39.719> you

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
vintage mode the modern mode is what you

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.900 
vintage mode the modern mode is what you
would<00:00:39.960> expect<00:00:40.020> in<00:00:40.530> other<00:00:40.680> words<00:00:40.890> when<00:00:41.489> you<00:00:41.640> set

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
would expect in other words when you set

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.330 
would expect in other words when you set
a<00:00:42.090> repeat<00:00:42.540> in<00:00:42.750> the<00:00:42.899> modern<00:00:43.230> mode<00:00:43.440> what<00:00:44.219> you

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
a repeat in the modern mode what you

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.600 
a repeat in the modern mode what you
play<00:00:44.550> into<00:00:44.820> it<00:00:44.969> comes<00:00:45.210> back<00:00:45.450> exactly<00:00:46.610> sounding

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
play into it comes back exactly sounding

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.490 
play into it comes back exactly sounding
exactly<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.570> way<00:00:48.690> that<00:00:48.840> you<00:00:48.899> played<00:00:49.200> into<00:00:49.469> it

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
exactly the way that you played into it

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:50.810 
exactly the way that you played into it
so<00:00:49.829> it's<00:00:49.950> full<00:00:50.190> fidelity

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
so it's full fidelity

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:56.360 
so it's full fidelity
there's<00:00:51.660> no<00:00:52.820> overt<00:00:54.469> steam<00:00:55.469> compression<00:00:56.250> or

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
there's no overt steam compression or

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:57.979 
there's no overt steam compression or
saturation<00:00:56.910> that<00:00:57.120> we're<00:00:57.390> trying<00:00:57.629> to<00:00:57.690> emulate

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
saturation that we're trying to emulate

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.750 
saturation that we're trying to emulate
it's<00:00:58.649> pretty<00:00:58.920> much<00:00:59.070> going<00:00:59.309> to<00:00:59.399> whack<00:00:59.550> you

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
it's pretty much going to whack you

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.040 
it's pretty much going to whack you
right<00:00:59.940> in<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.120> face<00:01:00.300> just<00:01:00.629> the<00:01:00.750> way<00:01:00.840> that<00:01:00.989> you

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
right in the face just the way that you

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.290 
right in the face just the way that you
played<00:01:01.440> it<00:01:01.649> and<00:01:02.550> then<00:01:02.699> when<00:01:02.850> you<00:01:02.940> switch<00:01:03.270> to

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
played it and then when you switch to

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.300 
played it and then when you switch to
the<00:01:03.629> vintage<00:01:03.809> mode<00:01:04.250> a<00:01:05.270> really<00:01:06.270> unique

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:07.310 
the vintage mode a really unique

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.130 
the vintage mode a really unique
simulation<00:01:08.310> of<00:01:08.549> tape<00:01:08.880> saturation<00:01:09.119> kicks<00:01:09.900> in

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
simulation of tape saturation kicks in

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.910 
simulation of tape saturation kicks in
and<00:01:10.470> this<00:01:11.070> is<00:01:11.310> to<00:01:12.049> simulate<00:01:13.049> it<00:01:13.530> to<00:01:13.619> give<00:01:13.799> you

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
and this is to simulate it to give you

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.830 
and this is to simulate it to give you
the<00:01:13.979> feel<00:01:14.369> of<00:01:14.400> playing<00:01:14.970> into<00:01:15.210> an<00:01:15.330> old<00:01:15.509> Echoplex

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
the feel of playing into an old Echoplex

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.920 
the feel of playing into an old Echoplex
Allah<00:01:16.350> and<00:01:16.530> we<00:01:16.680> used<00:01:16.950> a<00:01:17.100> very<00:01:17.369> old<00:01:18.119> grey<00:01:18.630> beat

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
Allah and we used a very old grey beat

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.300 
Allah and we used a very old grey beat
up<00:01:19.049> a<00:01:19.170> complex<00:01:19.530> that<00:01:19.740> I've<00:01:19.890> had<00:01:20.040> for<00:01:20.280> years

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
up a complex that I've had for years

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.460 
up a complex that I've had for years
used<00:01:21.240> it<00:01:21.420> on<00:01:21.479> many<00:01:21.750> records<00:01:22.229> and

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:23.470 
used it on many records and

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:26.040 
used it on many records and
it<00:01:24.340> had<00:01:24.760> two<00:01:24.940> features<00:01:25.150> number<00:01:25.570> one<00:01:25.720> it<00:01:25.900> had<00:01:26.020> a

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:26.050 
it had two features number one it had a

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:28.740 
it had two features number one it had a
really<00:01:26.290> beautiful<00:01:27.040> tape<00:01:27.670> saturation<00:01:27.970> sound

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:28.750 
really beautiful tape saturation sound

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:30.150 
really beautiful tape saturation sound
that<00:01:28.990> would<00:01:29.110> just<00:01:29.320> make<00:01:29.470> everything<00:01:29.710> that

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:30.160 
that would just make everything that

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:31.700 
that would just make everything that
came<00:01:30.370> back<00:01:30.580> in<00:01:30.760> the<00:01:30.850> delay<00:01:31.150> sound<00:01:31.480> beautiful

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
came back in the delay sound beautiful

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.320 
came back in the delay sound beautiful
it<00:01:32.710> also<00:01:32.860> had<00:01:33.160> this<00:01:33.250> one<00:01:33.460> problem<00:01:33.820> which<00:01:34.150> is

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:34.330 
it also had this one problem which is

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:37.860 
it also had this one problem which is
the<00:01:34.480> the<00:01:34.990> roller<00:01:35.380> of<00:01:35.470> the<00:01:35.560> capstan<00:01:36.540> was<00:01:37.540> just

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:37.870 
the the roller of the capstan was just

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:40.560 
the the roller of the capstan was just
so<00:01:38.080> trashed<00:01:38.710> that<00:01:39.010> it<00:01:39.670> completely<00:01:40.090> changed

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:40.570 
so trashed that it completely changed

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:42.480 
so trashed that it completely changed
the<00:01:40.690> pitch<00:01:40.930> just<00:01:40.960> about<00:01:41.500> every<00:01:41.800> two<00:01:41.980> seconds

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:42.490 
the pitch just about every two seconds

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:45.210 
the pitch just about every two seconds
so<00:01:43.090> it<00:01:43.450> was<00:01:43.630> pretty<00:01:43.840> barb<00:01:44.200> Lee<00:01:44.380> sounding<00:01:44.800> and<00:01:45.010> a

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:45.220 
so it was pretty barb Lee sounding and a

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:47.040 
so it was pretty barb Lee sounding and a
lot<00:01:45.520> of<00:01:45.550> times<00:01:45.820> we<00:01:46.000> had<00:01:46.150> to<00:01:46.240> keep<00:01:46.390> reprinting

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:47.050 
lot of times we had to keep reprinting

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:48.930 
lot of times we had to keep reprinting
him<00:01:47.170> when<00:01:47.740> we<00:01:47.830> were<00:01:47.950> using<00:01:48.130> it<00:01:48.370> for<00:01:48.400> a<00:01:48.610> record

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:48.940 
him when we were using it for a record

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:51.720 
him when we were using it for a record
but<00:01:49.690> every<00:01:50.290> once<00:01:50.500> in<00:01:50.650> a<00:01:50.740> while<00:01:50.770> it<00:01:51.490> would

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:51.730 
but every once in a while it would

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:54.270 
but every once in a while it would
wobble<00:01:51.970> just<00:01:52.240> the<00:01:52.930> right<00:01:53.110> amount<00:01:53.440> and<00:01:54.040> that's

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:54.280 
wobble just the right amount and that's

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.940 
wobble just the right amount and that's
what<00:01:54.490> we<00:01:54.840> simulated<00:01:55.840> in<00:01:56.020> the<00:01:56.110> vintage<00:01:56.290> mode<00:01:56.680> so

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:56.950 
what we simulated in the vintage mode so

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:00.060 
what we simulated in the vintage mode so
there's<00:01:57.130> a<00:01:57.190> very<00:01:57.610> slight<00:01:58.170> pitch<00:01:59.170> fluctuation

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:00.070 
there's a very slight pitch fluctuation

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:02.910 
there's a very slight pitch fluctuation
that<00:02:00.510> you'll<00:02:01.510> hear<00:02:01.750> coming<00:02:02.080> out<00:02:02.170> of<00:02:02.350> here<00:02:02.500> when

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:02.920 
that you'll hear coming out of here when

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.960 
that you'll hear coming out of here when
when<00:02:03.490> you<00:02:03.670> engage<00:02:04.030> the<00:02:04.619> vintage<00:02:05.619> mode<00:02:05.970> in

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:06.970 
when you engage the vintage mode in

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:09.870 
when you engage the vintage mode in
addition<00:02:07.450> to<00:02:07.540> that<00:02:07.690> there's<00:02:08.560> an<00:02:08.770> EQ<00:02:09.310> switch<00:02:09.610> on

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:09.880 
addition to that there's an EQ switch on

your delay pedal if you're not looking

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:36.990 
your delay pedal if you're not looking
for<00:02:35.110> actual<00:02:35.739> repeats<00:02:36.190> but<00:02:36.700> you're<00:02:36.850> really

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
for actual repeats but you're really

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.400 
for actual repeats but you're really

like<00:02:38.790> repeats<00:02:39.790> delays<00:02:40.500> almost<00:02:41.500> more

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:41.800 
like repeats delays almost more

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.420

fifty<00:03:13.950> two<00:03:14.280> hundred<00:03:14.310> fifty<00:03:15.000> eight<00:03:15.030> hundred

milliseconds something like that with

00:03:20.839 --> 00:03:20.849 
the tap function so if you really like

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:22.789 
the tap function so if you really like
those<00:03:21.030> ultra<00:03:21.480> long<00:03:21.720> delays<00:03:22.079> I<00:03:22.379> don't<00:03:22.650> think

those ultra long delays I don't think

those ultra long delays I don't think
I've<00:03:22.859> ever<00:03:22.950> used
