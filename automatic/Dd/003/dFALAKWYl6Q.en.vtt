hands on video the LG g2 now this phone
is<00:00:10.349> interesting<00:00:11.160> and<00:00:11.280> has<00:00:11.490> caught<00:00:12.000> some

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
is interesting and has caught some

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.570 
is interesting and has caught some
attention<00:00:13.019> because<00:00:13.469> it<00:00:13.740> is<00:00:13.889> the<00:00:14.009> first<00:00:14.190> phone

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
attention because it is the first phone

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.260 
attention because it is the first phone
to<00:00:14.610> have<00:00:14.910> controls<00:00:15.660> on<00:00:16.049> the<00:00:16.260> back<00:00:16.440> now<00:00:17.430> LG<00:00:17.910> has

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
to have controls on the back now LG has

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:19.820 
to have controls on the back now LG has
clearly<00:00:18.570> thought<00:00:18.810> about<00:00:18.960> this<00:00:19.140> actually<00:00:19.619> and

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
clearly thought about this actually and

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.250 
clearly thought about this actually and
although<00:00:20.250> some<00:00:20.609> people<00:00:20.730> are<00:00:21.000> sort<00:00:21.180> of

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:21.260 
although some people are sort of

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.480 
although some people are sort of
questioned<00:00:22.260> the<00:00:22.380> logic<00:00:22.769> of<00:00:22.890> having<00:00:23.220> buttons

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
questioned the logic of having buttons

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.130 
questioned the logic of having buttons
on<00:00:23.580> the<00:00:23.670> back<00:00:23.760> I<00:00:23.970> can<00:00:24.119> actually<00:00:24.390> see<00:00:24.570> why

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
on the back I can actually see why

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.660 
on the back I can actually see why
they've<00:00:25.380> done<00:00:25.560> it<00:00:25.680> for<00:00:26.099> example<00:00:26.430> it<00:00:26.580> is

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
they've done it for example it is

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.160 
they've done it for example it is
actually<00:00:26.849> quite<00:00:27.119> nice<00:00:27.330> to<00:00:27.599> adjust<00:00:27.869> the<00:00:27.990> call

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
actually quite nice to adjust the call

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.050 
actually quite nice to adjust the call
volume<00:00:28.230> while<00:00:28.980> you're<00:00:29.189> on<00:00:29.429> the<00:00:29.789> call<00:00:29.970> without

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
volume while you're on the call without

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.490 
volume while you're on the call without
having<00:00:30.449> to<00:00:30.539> fumble<00:00:30.720> around<00:00:30.929> the<00:00:31.140> side<00:00:31.320> now

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
having to fumble around the side now

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:32.870 
having to fumble around the side now
I've<00:00:31.619> done<00:00:31.800> that<00:00:31.949> loads<00:00:32.189> of<00:00:32.340> times<00:00:32.579> with<00:00:32.759> my

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
I've done that loads of times with my

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.000 
I've done that loads of times with my
phone<00:00:33.180> and<00:00:33.660> I've<00:00:33.780> always<00:00:34.050> found<00:00:34.500> it<00:00:34.649> to<00:00:34.680> be<00:00:34.739> a

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
phone and I've always found it to be a

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.729 
phone and I've always found it to be a
problem<00:00:35.640> and<00:00:36.390> it's<00:00:36.750> just<00:00:36.840> not<00:00:37.230> here<00:00:37.500> that's

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
problem and it's just not here that's

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.190 
problem and it's just not here that's
much<00:00:37.980> easier<00:00:38.160> way<00:00:38.730> of<00:00:38.760> doing<00:00:39.149> things<00:00:39.420> now

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
much easier way of doing things now

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.959 
much easier way of doing things now
obviously<00:00:40.410> the<00:00:40.920> buttons<00:00:41.340> on<00:00:41.399> the<00:00:41.489> back<00:00:41.610> mean

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
obviously the buttons on the back mean

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.760 
obviously the buttons on the back mean
the<00:00:42.180> phone<00:00:42.390> doesn't<00:00:42.750> have<00:00:42.780> buttons<00:00:43.290> on<00:00:43.469> the

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
the phone doesn't have buttons on the

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.670 
the phone doesn't have buttons on the
side<00:00:44.329> and<00:00:45.329> that<00:00:45.510> means<00:00:45.780> that<00:00:46.050> there's<00:00:46.440> no<00:00:46.559> way

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
side and that means that there's no way

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.680 
side and that means that there's no way
to<00:00:46.739> turn<00:00:47.010> it<00:00:47.160> on<00:00:47.250> it<00:00:47.399> release<00:00:47.610> not<00:00:47.789> visibly<00:00:48.239> but

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
to turn it on it release not visibly but

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:49.970 
to turn it on it release not visibly but
in<00:00:48.780> fact<00:00:48.930> the<00:00:49.110> solution<00:00:49.500> to<00:00:49.559> that<00:00:49.680> is<00:00:49.739> rather

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
in fact the solution to that is rather

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.420 
in fact the solution to that is rather
clever<00:00:50.280> you<00:00:50.489> simply<00:00:50.940> double<00:00:51.629> tap<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:52.170> screen

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:52.430 
clever you simply double tap the screen

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:56.180 
clever you simply double tap the screen
and<00:00:53.430> all<00:00:53.640> it<00:00:53.760> comes<00:00:54.000> and<00:00:54.300> also<00:00:55.199> if<00:00:55.440> you<00:00:55.620> double

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
and all it comes and also if you double

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.310 
and all it comes and also if you double
tap<00:00:56.309> screen<00:00:56.550> again<00:00:56.879> the<00:00:57.660> phone<00:00:57.870> goes<00:00:58.079> off<00:00:58.170> into

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
tap screen again the phone goes off into

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.170 
tap screen again the phone goes off into
standby<00:00:58.710> that's<00:00:59.219> actually<00:00:59.489> a<00:00:59.609> really<00:00:59.699> elegant

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
standby that's actually a really elegant

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.240 
standby that's actually a really elegant
solution<00:01:00.960> a<00:01:01.079> really<00:01:01.350> nice<00:01:01.530> way<00:01:01.770> around<00:01:02.039> using

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
solution a really nice way around using

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.939 
solution a really nice way around using
a<00:01:02.399> button<00:01:02.730> and<00:01:03.660> actually<00:01:04.140> I<00:01:04.530> think<00:01:04.619> it's

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
a button and actually I think it's

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.320 
a button and actually I think it's
amazing<00:01:05.339> that<00:01:05.580> no<00:01:05.760> one's<00:01:05.970> thought<00:01:06.119> of<00:01:06.180> it

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
amazing that no one's thought of it

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.020 
amazing that no one's thought of it
before<00:01:06.450> because<00:01:06.810> it's<00:01:07.020> such<00:01:07.200> a<00:01:07.229> good<00:01:07.500> idea<00:01:08.030> so

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
before because it's such a good idea so

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.429 
before because it's such a good idea so
what<00:01:09.330> else<00:01:09.450> do<00:01:09.540> I<00:01:09.630> well<00:01:09.840> physically<00:01:10.170> this

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
what else do I well physically this

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.170 
what else do I well physically this
phone<00:01:10.680> is<00:01:10.860> actually<00:01:11.159> very<00:01:11.189> nice<00:01:11.549> indeed<00:01:11.850> if

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
phone is actually very nice indeed if

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.270 
phone is actually very nice indeed if
you<00:01:12.210> look<00:01:12.299> at<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.659> design<00:01:13.080> it's<00:01:13.680> got<00:01:14.070> a<00:01:14.100> nice

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
you look at the design it's got a nice

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.219 
you look at the design it's got a nice
glossy<00:01:14.729> look<00:01:15.150> it<00:01:15.360> is<00:01:15.509> a<00:01:15.540> fingerprint<00:01:16.110> magnet

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
glossy look it is a fingerprint magnet

ago<00:01:42.390> a<00:01:42.479> phone<00:01:42.780> I<00:01:42.990> really<00:01:43.320> really<00:01:43.710> liked<00:01:44.450> what

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
ago a phone I really really liked what

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.210 
ago a phone I really really liked what
else<00:01:45.600> is<00:01:45.810> interesting<00:01:45.990> about<00:01:46.350> this<00:01:46.560> well<00:01:46.890> it's

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
else is interesting about this well it's

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.399 
else is interesting about this well it's
got<00:01:47.369> a<00:01:47.399> sim<00:01:47.970> tray<00:01:48.390> you<00:01:48.450> have<00:01:48.659> to<00:01:48.810> pop<00:01:49.020> out<00:01:49.200> with

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
got a sim tray you have to pop out with

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.410 
got a sim tray you have to pop out with
a<00:01:49.439> pin<00:01:49.790> that's<00:01:50.790> getting<00:01:51.090> more<00:01:51.270> and<00:01:51.360> more

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
a pin that's getting more and more

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.139 
a pin that's getting more and more
common<00:01:51.600> but<00:01:51.869> of<00:01:51.960> course<00:01:52.110> the<00:01:52.229> battery<00:01:53.149> isn't

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
common but of course the battery isn't

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:55.760 
common but of course the battery isn't
accessible<00:01:54.630> and<00:01:54.840> you<00:01:54.930> can't<00:01:55.229> move<00:01:55.470> the<00:01:55.590> back

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
accessible and you can't move the back

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.230 
accessible and you can't move the back
of<00:01:55.979> the<00:01:56.070> phone<00:01:56.340> now<00:01:56.850> what's<00:01:57.060> interesting

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
of the phone now what's interesting

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.719 
of the phone now what's interesting
about<00:01:57.659> that<00:01:57.780> is<00:01:57.960> that<00:01:58.140> LG<00:01:58.649> has<00:01:58.799> used<00:01:59.250> the<00:01:59.430> shape

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
about that is that LG has used the shape

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.560 
about that is that LG has used the shape
of<00:01:59.969> this<00:02:00.119> phone<00:02:00.619> and<00:02:01.619> it's<00:02:02.310> that's<00:02:02.969> part<00:02:03.450> of

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
of this phone and it's that's part of

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.870 
of this phone and it's that's part of
how<00:02:03.840> the<00:02:03.899> battery<00:02:04.500> capacity<00:02:05.009> is<00:02:05.189> so<00:02:05.430> large<00:02:05.670> it

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
how the battery capacity is so large it

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.719 
how the battery capacity is so large it
has<00:02:06.350> 3,000<00:02:07.350> milliamp<00:02:08.009> hour

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
has 3,000 milliamp hour

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.880 
has 3,000 milliamp hour
tree<00:02:09.060> that's<00:02:09.899> quite<00:02:10.050> impressive<00:02:10.349> and<00:02:10.739> it's

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
tree that's quite impressive and it's

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.520 
tree that's quite impressive and it's
actually<00:02:11.129> nearly<00:02:12.120> as<00:02:12.450> much<00:02:12.690> capacity<00:02:13.049> as<00:02:13.440> you

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
actually nearly as much capacity as you

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.020 
actually nearly as much capacity as you
get<00:02:13.680> in<00:02:13.739> a<00:02:13.799> Galaxy<00:02:14.099> Note<00:02:14.340> 2<00:02:14.519> and<00:02:14.670> that<00:02:14.879> is<00:02:15.000> a

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
get in a Galaxy Note 2 and that is a

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.509 
get in a Galaxy Note 2 and that is a
much<00:02:15.299> bigger<00:02:15.510> phone<00:02:16.159> the<00:02:17.159> difference

00:02:17.509 --> 00:02:17.519 
much bigger phone the difference

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:20.149 
much bigger phone the difference
obviously<00:02:17.640> here<00:02:18.090> is<00:02:18.290> you<00:02:19.290> can't<00:02:19.530> access<00:02:20.010> it

00:02:20.149 --> 00:02:20.159 
obviously here is you can't access it

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:22.039 
obviously here is you can't access it
but<00:02:20.280> also<00:02:20.430> the<00:02:20.670> battery<00:02:21.090> is<00:02:21.239> a<00:02:21.510> side<00:02:22.019> of

00:02:22.039 --> 00:02:22.049 
but also the battery is a side of

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:24.350 
but also the battery is a side of
InDesign<00:02:22.500> it's<00:02:22.799> some<00:02:23.069> it's<00:02:23.519> got<00:02:23.670> a<00:02:23.700> step<00:02:24.120> on

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
InDesign it's some it's got a step on

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.390 
InDesign it's some it's got a step on
the<00:02:24.540> edge<00:02:24.659> which<00:02:24.870> enables<00:02:25.349> them<00:02:25.500> to<00:02:25.560> have<00:02:25.799> more

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
the edge which enables them to have more

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.650 
the edge which enables them to have more
capacity<00:02:26.519> it's<00:02:26.879> not<00:02:27.030> a<00:02:27.060> sort<00:02:27.269> of<00:02:27.299> battery

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
capacity it's not a sort of battery

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:28.970 
capacity it's not a sort of battery
you're<00:02:27.840> familiar<00:02:28.019> with<00:02:28.200> seeing<00:02:28.500> but<00:02:28.769> because

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
you're familiar with seeing but because

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:30.400 
you're familiar with seeing but because
it's<00:02:29.129> built<00:02:29.370> in<00:02:29.580> it<00:02:29.760> doesn't<00:02:30.030> really<00:02:30.150> matter

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 
it's built in it doesn't really matter

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:34.430 
it's built in it doesn't really matter
and<00:02:31.410> that's<00:02:31.799> a<00:02:31.920> really<00:02:32.160> nice<00:02:32.430> idea<00:02:33.180> but<00:02:33.480> while

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
and that's a really nice idea but while

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:35.900 
and that's a really nice idea but while
we're<00:02:34.560> talking<00:02:34.680> about<00:02:34.920> battery<00:02:35.459> it's<00:02:35.790> not

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
we're talking about battery it's not

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:37.460 
we're talking about battery it's not
just<00:02:35.970> about<00:02:36.360> the<00:02:36.569> capacity<00:02:37.260> of<00:02:37.290> the<00:02:37.410> battery

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
just about the capacity of the battery

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.559 
just about the capacity of the battery
itself<00:02:37.860> that's<00:02:38.340> important<00:02:38.790> because<00:02:39.360> the

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:39.569 
itself that's important because the

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:42.020 
itself that's important because the
high-resolution<00:02:39.930> screen<00:02:40.680> will<00:02:41.310> always<00:02:41.670> drain

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
high-resolution screen will always drain

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:43.759 
high-resolution screen will always drain
more<00:02:42.360> power<00:02:42.660> than<00:02:42.810> a<00:02:42.900> low<00:02:43.019> resolution<00:02:43.170> screen

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:43.769 
more power than a low resolution screen

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:45.800 
more power than a low resolution screen
what<00:02:44.430> is<00:02:44.549> interesting<00:02:45.000> is<00:02:45.150> that<00:02:45.209> this<00:02:45.510> is<00:02:45.690> the

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
what is interesting is that this is the

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.440 
what is interesting is that this is the
first<00:02:46.079> phone<00:02:46.319> to<00:02:46.500> use<00:02:46.769> something<00:02:47.310> called<00:02:47.609> G

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
first phone to use something called G

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.199 
first phone to use something called G
RAM<00:02:48.690> and<00:02:49.560> what<00:02:49.769> the<00:02:49.920> idea<00:02:50.280> here<00:02:50.519> is<00:02:50.549> if<00:02:50.700> you're

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
RAM and what the idea here is if you're

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:52.789 
RAM and what the idea here is if you're
if<00:02:51.510> you're<00:02:51.599> doing<00:02:51.870> something<00:02:52.290> where<00:02:52.470> an<00:02:52.590> image

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:52.799 
if you're doing something where an image

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:54.530 
if you're doing something where an image
is<00:02:52.920> retained<00:02:53.310> on<00:02:53.579> screen<00:02:53.940> for<00:02:54.150> a<00:02:54.180> long<00:02:54.329> period

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
is retained on screen for a long period

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.140 
is retained on screen for a long period
of<00:02:54.720> time<00:02:54.780> and<00:02:55.200> it<00:02:55.260> doesn't<00:02:55.500> move<00:02:55.680> much

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
of time and it doesn't move much

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.520 
of time and it doesn't move much
traditionally<00:02:57.150> in<00:02:57.239> a<00:02:57.299> phone<00:02:57.540> the<00:02:58.079> apparent

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
traditionally in a phone the apparent

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.800 
traditionally in a phone the apparent
the<00:02:58.620> graphics<00:02:58.920> memory<00:02:59.069> would<00:02:59.430> be<00:03:00.359> dealing

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
the graphics memory would be dealing

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:02.449 
the graphics memory would be dealing
with<00:03:00.840> that<00:03:00.989> and<00:03:01.170> your<00:03:01.260> GPU<00:03:01.680> would<00:03:02.040> be<00:03:02.160> running

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
with that and your GPU would be running

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:04.910 
with that and your GPU would be running
and<00:03:02.579> using<00:03:02.849> power<00:03:03.120> but<00:03:03.359> what<00:03:03.480> LG<00:03:04.200> has<00:03:04.440> done<00:03:04.680> is

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
and using power but what LG has done is

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.729 
and using power but what LG has done is
use<00:03:05.849> this<00:03:06.209> G<00:03:06.510> RAM<00:03:06.720> and<00:03:06.989> that<00:03:07.170> enables<00:03:07.590> the

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:07.739 
use this G RAM and that enables the

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:10.309 
use this G RAM and that enables the
screen<00:03:08.040> to<00:03:08.220> display<00:03:08.310> an<00:03:08.910> image<00:03:09.170> for<00:03:10.170> a<00:03:10.200> long

00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:10.319 
screen to display an image for a long

screen to display an image for a long
period<00:03:10.410> of<00:03:10.560> time<00:03:10.620> but<00:03:10.769> use<00:03:10.980> much<00:03:11.340> less<00:03:11.370> power

00:03:11.869 --> 00:03:11.879 
period of time but use much less power

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:14.839 
period of time but use much less power
they<00:03:12.120> say<00:03:12.450> on<00:03:12.599> a<00:03:12.660> static<00:03:13.109> image<00:03:13.260> as<00:03:14.220> little<00:03:14.669> as

00:03:14.839 --> 00:03:14.849 
they say on a static image as little as

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:18.500 
they say on a static image as little as
twenty<00:03:15.359> five<00:03:15.630> percent<00:03:15.660> power<00:03:16.880> over<00:03:17.880> rivals

twenty five percent power over rivals

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.780 
twenty five percent power over rivals
and<00:03:19.109> they<00:03:19.260> reckon<00:03:19.560> that<00:03:19.680> equates<00:03:20.069> to<00:03:20.190> a<00:03:20.370> ten

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
and they reckon that equates to a ten

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:23.210 
and they reckon that equates to a ten
percent<00:03:20.940> saving<00:03:21.720> over<00:03:21.840> all<00:03:22.380> use<00:03:22.680> of<00:03:22.889> the<00:03:22.980> phone

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
percent saving over all use of the phone

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.819 
percent saving over all use of the phone
now<00:03:23.700> which<00:03:23.880> is<00:03:23.910> pretty<00:03:24.209> good<00:03:24.419> LG<00:03:25.200> told<00:03:25.440> us<00:03:25.590> they

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:25.829 
now which is pretty good LG told us they

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:28.250 
now which is pretty good LG told us they
think<00:03:26.190> it's<00:03:26.489> got<00:03:27.180> a<00:03:27.209> good<00:03:27.450> day<00:03:27.690> and<00:03:27.870> a<00:03:27.900> half<00:03:28.079> to

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
think it's got a good day and a half to

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.289 
think it's got a good day and a half to
two<00:03:28.290> days<00:03:28.769> life<00:03:29.069> in<00:03:29.340> it<00:03:29.489> and<00:03:29.819> that<00:03:29.880> kind<00:03:30.209> of

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:30.299 
two days life in it and that kind of

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:32.750 
two days life in it and that kind of
fits<00:03:30.569> with<00:03:30.810> my<00:03:31.410> experience<00:03:31.950> of<00:03:32.099> phones<00:03:32.489> with

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
fits with my experience of phones with

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.129 
fits with my experience of phones with
three<00:03:33.090> thousand<00:03:33.630> million<00:03:33.870> per<00:03:34.019> hour

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:34.139 
three thousand million per hour

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:35.780 
three thousand million per hour
batteries<00:03:35.040> but<00:03:35.190> of<00:03:35.280> course<00:03:35.459> it<00:03:35.609> really

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
batteries but of course it really

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:37.190 
batteries but of course it really
depends<00:03:36.090> on<00:03:36.150> how<00:03:36.209> you<00:03:36.329> use<00:03:36.480> the<00:03:36.750> phone<00:03:36.989> and

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
depends on how you use the phone and

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.640 
depends on how you use the phone and
everyone's<00:03:37.530> usage<00:03:38.010> is<00:03:38.160> different<00:03:39.620> now<00:03:40.620> I

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
everyone's usage is different now I

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:43.520 
everyone's usage is different now I
mentioned<00:03:41.400> that<00:03:42.150> you<00:03:42.540> can<00:03:42.750> double<00:03:43.109> tap<00:03:43.290> the

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
mentioned that you can double tap the

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:45.500 
mentioned that you can double tap the
screen<00:03:43.769> to<00:03:43.980> turn<00:03:44.280> it<00:03:44.430> on<00:03:44.549> and<00:03:44.760> double<00:03:45.269> tap<00:03:45.389> it

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
screen to turn it on and double tap it

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:47.030 
screen to turn it on and double tap it
again<00:03:45.750> to<00:03:45.900> turn<00:03:46.049> it<00:03:46.200> off<00:03:46.319> and<00:03:46.560> that<00:03:46.620> works<00:03:46.859> very

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
again to turn it off and that works very

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.330 
again to turn it off and that works very
well<00:03:47.160> there<00:03:47.760> are<00:03:47.880> also<00:03:48.060> other<00:03:48.510> gestures<00:03:49.340> three

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
well there are also other gestures three

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:52.780 
well there are also other gestures three
fingers<00:03:50.760> in<00:03:50.790> the<00:03:50.910> display<00:03:51.180> enable<00:03:51.660> you<00:03:51.780> to

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:52.790 
fingers in the display enable you to

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:55.129 
fingers in the display enable you to
multitask<00:03:53.790> between<00:03:54.269> a<00:03:54.389> set<00:03:54.720> number<00:03:54.750> of<00:03:54.989> apps

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:55.139 
multitask between a set number of apps

00:03:55.139 --> 00:03:57.319 
multitask between a set number of apps
now<00:03:55.319> the<00:03:55.379> maximum<00:03:55.829> is<00:03:55.980> three<00:03:56.340> what<00:03:57.000> you<00:03:57.060> can<00:03:57.209> do

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:57.329

00:03:57.329 --> 00:04:00.170 
now the maximum is three what you can do
is<00:03:57.450> you<00:03:57.540> can<00:03:57.569> be<00:03:57.780> inside<00:03:58.200> the<00:03:58.260> gallery<00:03:59.180> swipe

easily and you can see what each of them

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:08.569 
easily and you can see what each of them
is<00:04:07.590> running<00:04:07.859> it's<00:04:08.190> a<00:04:08.220> nice<00:04:08.400> little

cool<00:04:13.440> feature<00:04:13.680> and<00:04:13.949> I<00:04:13.980> rather<00:04:14.190> liked<00:04:14.459> it<00:04:15.410> also

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:16.410 
cool feature and I rather liked it also

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:18.420

of<00:05:00.940> the<00:05:01.090> camera<00:05:01.539> and<00:05:01.720> it's<00:05:01.930> a<00:05:02.020> 13<00:05:02.560> megapixel

00:05:02.909 --> 00:05:02.919

00:05:02.919 --> 00:05:04.950 
of the camera and it's a 13 megapixel
shooter<00:05:03.400> and<00:05:04.060> there<00:05:04.449> were<00:05:04.539> lots<00:05:04.750> of

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:04.960 
shooter and there were lots of

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:07.469 
shooter and there were lots of
interesting<00:05:05.800> ways<00:05:05.860> in<00:05:06.580> which<00:05:06.639> the<00:05:07.000> camera<00:05:07.360> app

00:05:07.469 --> 00:05:07.479 
interesting ways in which the camera app

00:05:07.479 --> 00:05:08.879 
interesting ways in which the camera app
works<00:05:07.720> it<00:05:07.990> seems<00:05:08.320> to<00:05:08.440> have<00:05:08.530> been<00:05:08.620> thought<00:05:08.770> out

00:05:08.879 --> 00:05:08.889 
works it seems to have been thought out

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:11.390 
works it seems to have been thought out
quite<00:05:09.099> well<00:05:09.130> has<00:05:09.639> a<00:05:09.669> 9-point<00:05:10.479> focusing<00:05:11.110> system

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:11.400 
quite well has a 9-point focusing system

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.320 
quite well has a 9-point focusing system
which<00:05:12.400> means<00:05:12.639> it's<00:05:12.789> able<00:05:13.030> to<00:05:13.060> sort<00:05:13.270> of

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:13.330 
which means it's able to sort of

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:16.350 
which means it's able to sort of
automatically<00:05:13.780> track<00:05:14.320> 9<00:05:14.800> sort<00:05:15.639> of<00:05:15.699> areas<00:05:16.150> on

screen<00:05:16.810> you<00:05:17.229> can<00:05:17.380> you<00:05:17.530> still<00:05:17.830> use<00:05:17.860> the<00:05:18.009> tap<00:05:18.400> to

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:18.610

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:20.400 
screen you can you still use the tap to
focus<00:05:18.639> method<00:05:19.360> which<00:05:19.479> I<00:05:19.660> think<00:05:19.900> people<00:05:20.110> are

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:20.410 
focus method which I think people are

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:22.110 
focus method which I think people are
probably<00:05:20.770> quite<00:05:21.070> used<00:05:21.340> to<00:05:21.460> these<00:05:21.669> days<00:05:21.880> owner

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:22.120 
probably quite used to these days owner

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:23.850 
probably quite used to these days owner
is<00:05:22.510> probably<00:05:22.870> one<00:05:23.020> of<00:05:23.050> the<00:05:23.169> better<00:05:23.320> ways<00:05:23.620> of

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:23.860 
is probably one of the better ways of

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:27.270 
is probably one of the better ways of
taking<00:05:24.250> pictures<00:05:24.880> from<00:05:25.870> a<00:05:25.960> video<00:05:26.289> perspective

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:27.280 
taking pictures from a video perspective

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:30.240 
taking pictures from a video perspective
you<00:05:28.210> get<00:05:28.360> 1080p<00:05:29.050> and<00:05:29.260> you<00:05:29.349> get<00:05:29.470> that<00:05:29.560> in<00:05:29.680> 60

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:30.250 
you get 1080p and you get that in 60

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:31.589 
you get 1080p and you get that in 60
frames<00:05:30.610> a<00:05:30.760> second<00:05:31.120> now<00:05:31.180> that's<00:05:31.330> actually

00:05:31.589 --> 00:05:31.599 
frames a second now that's actually

00:05:31.599 --> 00:05:34.050 
frames a second now that's actually
quite<00:05:31.720> good<00:05:31.810> and<00:05:32.080> you<00:05:32.169> get<00:05:32.800> very<00:05:32.979> very<00:05:33.490> smooth

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:34.060 
quite good and you get very very smooth

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:36.810 
quite good and you get very very smooth
motion<00:05:34.419> doing<00:05:35.020> that<00:05:35.229> that's<00:05:36.070> sort<00:05:36.699> of<00:05:36.760> like

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:36.820 
motion doing that that's sort of like

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:38.939 
motion doing that that's sort of like
the<00:05:37.060> equivalent<00:05:37.570> of<00:05:37.659> if<00:05:38.409> you've<00:05:38.680> seen

00:05:38.939 --> 00:05:38.949 
the equivalent of if you've seen

00:05:38.949 --> 00:05:41.250 
the equivalent of if you've seen
something<00:05:39.130> like<00:05:39.250> Sky<00:05:39.789> News<00:05:40.120> HD<00:05:40.599> it<00:05:40.780> looks<00:05:40.990> very

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:41.260 
something like Sky News HD it looks very

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:42.659 
something like Sky News HD it looks very
similar<00:05:41.380> to<00:05:41.560> that<00:05:41.770> because<00:05:41.979> it's<00:05:42.190> high<00:05:42.370> frame

00:05:42.659 --> 00:05:42.669 
similar to that because it's high frame

00:05:42.669 --> 00:05:44.700 
similar to that because it's high frame
rate<00:05:42.880> it's<00:05:43.210> not<00:05:43.419> got<00:05:43.599> that<00:05:43.630> film<00:05:44.139> look<00:05:44.440> that

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:44.710 
rate it's not got that film look that

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:46.649 
rate it's not got that film look that
people<00:05:44.949> are<00:05:45.039> probably<00:05:45.250> used<00:05:45.460> to<00:05:45.580> with<00:05:45.760> HDTV<00:05:46.150> so

00:05:46.649 --> 00:05:46.659 
people are probably used to with HDTV so

00:05:46.659 --> 00:05:48.050 
people are probably used to with HDTV so
it<00:05:46.750> is<00:05:46.870> a<00:05:46.900> very<00:05:47.139> smooth<00:05:47.590> very

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:48.060 
it is a very smooth very

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:51.270 
it is a very smooth very
realistic-looking<00:05:49.060> image<00:05:50.070> another<00:05:51.070> feature

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:51.280

we're really rather fond of is guest
mode<00:05:54.580> now<00:05:54.909> what<00:05:55.120> that<00:05:55.150> means<00:05:55.449> is<00:05:55.690> if<00:05:56.139> you<00:05:56.349> use

00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:56.680 
mode now what that means is if you use

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:58.170 
mode now what that means is if you use
an<00:05:57.009> unlock<00:05:57.250> pattern<00:05:57.460> to<00:05:57.669> get<00:05:57.789> into<00:05:58.000> your
