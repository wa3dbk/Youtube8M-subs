00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:08.369
 Hello and welcome to another video 

00:00:08.369 --> 00:00:12.989
 Today it is time again and is Larry Korda and this time in connection with the 

00:00:12.989 --> 00:00:18.269
 Programs own in the moment what you can open for Mac and for Windows 

00:00:18.269 --> 00:00:20.800
 I think it costs about 15 euros 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.800
 or $ 15, but I'm not sure 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:24.849
 I believe Euro 

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:29.999
 In any case, he is in my opinion the Wittlich easiest 

00:00:29.999 --> 00:00:33.259
 Possibility these videos that one with that Gary Cole on 8 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.370
 to get on his PC especially because you have the possibility so 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.450
 at least then so I made now you have the sound directly on the possibility 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.190
 to record at the same time 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:46.229
 that is called 

00:00:46.229 --> 00:00:49.979
 In percentages, these problems only countered me as everyone shared the 

00:00:49.979 --> 00:00:53.729
 iPod iPhone or iPad RS on the computer Copy 

00:00:53.729 --> 00:00:57.509
 would lie with video editing program the soundtrack you 

00:00:57.509 --> 00:01:01.080
 somehow now parallel to it has recorded or other 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:03.510
 You can do everything in one go 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.510
 Sounds like this is best with my iPod 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:10.390
 in Seattle first a demo 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:13.220
 I can also say the motto to the program so you can see them 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.660
 be from 4 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:20.590
 m if you make a legally safe village first builds l Piszczek was rolling 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:23.900
 that's that it's it's clear that's good 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.820
 then at the hearth percent of wisdom 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.020
 I also put it automatically you can 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.539
 m choose between iPhone so that's it now an i-phone Friedli 

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:35.110
 or percent how about 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:36.229
 and you can 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:39.229
 one percent then there is still iPhone 4 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.850
 the historical data 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.480
 and there is still the possibility to choose a suitable one 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.070
 Well, of course, I now take an iPhone 4 of course, although I turn off an iPod Touch 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:51.600
 Euro 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.880
 that should not be the problem 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.100
 good goes on then you have the margins size you can do that 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:02.690
 Example down to 50 percent or you just make it century 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.479
 I always have it at 115 12% at maximum 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:08.620
 around 

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:10.399
 Galls on a maximum of St 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:12.999
 that has the advantage i just take mine 

00:02:12.999 --> 00:02:15.159
 mainvestor Go on 

00:02:15.159 --> 00:02:18.370
 and this program with reference to her you see that the back is just mine 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:19.349
 background 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:22.830
 and he is now Mehmet's own ears with Camtasia Studio 

00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:24.589
 mean the sale 

00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:29.239
 and then have a break after the recording probably stop here a euro so 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:32.489
 relatively neat bigger the display in front of my iPod can be seen 

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:37.269
 so the whole thing is also in landscape mode you can never say hotels Left Kurt 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:38.199
 worldwide 

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:40.219
 Kemal twice good slices like that 

00:02:40.219 --> 00:02:44.430
 and by now that's about Max so if that's mostly Macs 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.979
 it has now been over the entire screen that is now indeed 

00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:49.400
 by something 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.619
 x light so only something important 

00:02:51.619 --> 00:02:55.689
 but for having all that size it really is a good one 

00:02:55.689 --> 00:02:57.969
 You can not give quality 

00:02:57.969 --> 00:03:01.150
 The past at 100% then you see it is getting smaller 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:04.470
 now this would be the resolution the retina display is 

00:03:06.169 --> 00:03:10.680
 I'm still on as if and as Dreyer is that again and again 

00:03:10.679 --> 00:03:11.849
 around 

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:14.429
 and because you have a quick look 

00:03:14.429 --> 00:03:18.669
 and I still make my iPod once so the crawling used 

00:03:18.669 --> 00:03:19.499
 wireless Internet access 

00:03:19.499 --> 00:03:22.759
 so also at the Alkotest the Accord individual teaches and then I have now 

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:25.489
 here the possibility here the fleas Kauder 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:27.709
 select overripe 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:29.529
 or I have the opportunity 

00:03:29.529 --> 00:03:32.439
 simply connect the iPod to the computer 

00:03:32.439 --> 00:03:34.309
 I did that sometimes 

00:03:34.309 --> 00:03:37.679
 Datenklau and proppevoll then I also have the possibility that via USB too 

00:03:37.679 --> 00:03:38.599
 do 

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:42.029
 has the advantage that via USB that runs no bit more fluid 

00:03:43.779 --> 00:03:46.349
 it should also be here via USB 

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:49.349
 Dead spots short it is 

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:52.779
 but how was I now able to do that Ferry Char Darreh Bauer 2 

00:03:52.779 --> 00:03:56.309
 or that for records via USB I will now off via USB 

00:03:57.709 --> 00:03:59.889
 because it just goes bissiger so 

00:03:59.889 --> 00:04:03.319
 now it is that we first black man Albert Einstein at St 

00:04:04.059 --> 00:04:07.059
 and Prince, I'll do it 

00:04:08.999 --> 00:04:11.999
 Capello remains open Utl will 

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:17.519
 Well, by all means, you can now just about everything about its program 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:19.829
 Weekend as first video record 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:22.949
 and it is actor Tbilisi I think so 

00:04:22.949 --> 00:04:25.259
 that's enough 

00:04:25.259 --> 00:04:28.259
 it is also feasible for games 

00:04:28.849 --> 00:04:32.319
 and actually there are quite no problems i can also order once 

00:04:32.319 --> 00:04:35.340
 Landscape Witness Butt keeps holding 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:38.430
 so 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:42.510
 So it is actually hardly pixelated I think the quality is still 

00:04:42.509 --> 00:04:45.180
 Tampitt also suffered according to formats 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:48.610
 so if you watch it on YouTube and on Cook even if it's fullscreen 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:51.069
 I think the quality of the 60 1a 

00:04:51.069 --> 00:04:54.020
 and then that you have this size and the video then really into the house 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:57.250
 Georg Laden can as long as new monitor son resolution degree 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:00.990
 m that's a good result for me 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:04.409
 Rolf Emmermann both show I have their goal right there 

00:05:04.409 --> 00:05:07.599
 it means Intel's first software runs along with it 

00:05:07.599 --> 00:05:13.199
 and now I'm taking over as my screen and primulae round 

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:16.439
 what he is her animal itself 

00:05:16.439 --> 00:05:20.599
 and yes, of course, I'm going to set the tone for it right now and it is 

00:05:20.599 --> 00:05:24.619
 also in a file simply by the fact that Kim Tae Theres Studio the 

00:05:24.619 --> 00:05:27.919
 Sound recording here below you can see the audio 

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:30.449
 "If I speak then yes this p 

00:05:30.449 --> 00:05:32.249
 this rule 

00:05:32.249 --> 00:05:35.610
 and yes this is really just super possibility i can own my own 

00:05:35.609 --> 00:05:38.609
 really only recommend it if it costs a bit 

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:42.879
 and you have commented on this video and please 

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:45.659
 see you 

00:05:45.659 --> 00:05:47.849
 yes at the next video library parquet clear
