hi free percussion lessons calm we're
working<00:00:06.359> through<00:00:06.750> rudiments<00:00:07.649> a<00:00:08.929> rudiment

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
working through rudiments a rudiment

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:11.390 
working through rudiments a rudiment
that<00:00:10.110> we<00:00:10.200> all<00:00:10.320> need<00:00:10.500> to<00:00:10.620> practice<00:00:11.070> is<00:00:11.250> the

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
that we all need to practice is the

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.570 
that we all need to practice is the
double<00:00:11.730> paradiddle<00:00:12.320> if<00:00:13.320> you<00:00:13.500> remember<00:00:13.980> a<00:00:14.160> lot

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
double paradiddle if you remember a lot

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.640 
double paradiddle if you remember a lot
of<00:00:14.639> the<00:00:14.880> rudiments<00:00:15.360> I<00:00:15.540> would<00:00:16.080> say<00:00:16.230> most<00:00:16.440> of

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
of the rudiments I would say most of

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.880 
of the rudiments I would say most of
them<00:00:16.830> are<00:00:17.010> onomatopoeia<00:00:18.410> meaning<00:00:19.410> that<00:00:19.439> the

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
them are onomatopoeia meaning that the

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.390 
them are onomatopoeia meaning that the
word<00:00:20.820> itself<00:00:21.480> sounds<00:00:21.900> like<00:00:22.350> the<00:00:22.710> rudiment

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
word itself sounds like the rudiment

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.640 
word itself sounds like the rudiment
that<00:00:23.519> we're<00:00:23.640> trying<00:00:23.850> to<00:00:23.939> play<00:00:24.170> so<00:00:25.170> double

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
that we're trying to play so double

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.740 
that we're trying to play so double
paradiddle<00:00:26.210> so<00:00:27.210> double<00:00:27.779> pair<00:00:28.109> of<00:00:28.349> digital<00:00:28.980> six

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:29.750 
paradiddle so double pair of digital six

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:35.630 
paradiddle so double pair of digital six
notes<00:00:30.750> to<00:00:30.990> that<00:00:31.170> and<00:00:33.500> the<00:00:34.500> Dibble<00:00:34.920> is<00:00:35.100> the<00:00:35.489> only

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
notes to that and the Dibble is the only

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:53.330 
notes to that and the Dibble is the only
one<00:00:35.969> with<00:00:36.149> a<00:00:36.180> double<00:00:36.290> stroke<00:00:37.290> so<00:00:38.129> it's<00:00:52.219> it's<00:00:53.219> a

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
one with a double stroke so it's it's a

00:00:53.340 --> 00:01:04.640 
one with a double stroke so it's it's a
feeling<00:00:53.730> of<00:00:53.789> six<00:00:54.120> usually<00:01:03.379> always<00:01:04.379> start

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
feeling of six usually always start

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:15.039 
feeling of six usually always start
slowly<00:01:05.189> and<00:01:13.220> gradually<00:01:14.220> speed<00:01:14.760> up

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:15.049 
slowly and gradually speed up

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:30.249 
slowly and gradually speed up
maintaining<00:01:16.049> control<00:01:16.409> all<00:01:16.799> the<00:01:16.860> time

00:01:30.249 --> 00:01:30.259 

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:35.899
