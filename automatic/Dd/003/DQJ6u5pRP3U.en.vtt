00:00:27.729 --> 00:00:27.739 
much budget I mean I don't can't really

00:00:27.739 --> 00:00:28.630 
much budget I mean I don't can't really
think<00:00:27.800> of<00:00:27.919> anything<00:00:28.099> that's<00:00:28.369> too<00:00:28.460> expensive

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:28.640 
think of anything that's too expensive

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:30.519 
think of anything that's too expensive
than<00:00:29.300> using<00:00:29.449> this<00:00:29.659> deck<00:00:29.869> and<00:00:30.140> the<00:00:30.199> extra<00:00:30.439> deck

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:30.529 
than using this deck and the extra deck

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:32.860 
than using this deck and the extra deck
because<00:00:30.800> basically<00:00:30.999> you<00:00:31.999> have<00:00:32.150> to<00:00:32.270> use<00:00:32.390> utopia

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:32.870

because basically you have to use utopia
that's<00:00:33.350> about<00:00:33.530> it<00:00:33.739> then<00:00:33.920> you<00:00:34.010> pretty<00:00:34.160> much<00:00:34.220> use

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:34.460 
that's about it then you pretty much use

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:36.940 
that's about it then you pretty much use
any<00:00:34.670> rank<00:00:35.270> 5s<00:00:35.870> or<00:00:36.020> 4s<00:00:36.350> or<00:00:36.440> whatever<00:00:36.650> you<00:00:36.740> have

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:36.450 
throwing in an odd Reyes I mean it can

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:38.090

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:53.940 
Sigma a little better in certain

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:55.760 
Sigma a little better in certain
situations<00:06:54.570> and<00:06:54.930> it<00:06:55.229> would<00:06:55.320> also<00:06:55.440> help<00:06:55.650> me

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:55.770
