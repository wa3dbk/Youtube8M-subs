00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:22.460 
where you can see what I was talking
about<00:06:19.470> this<00:06:19.830> is<00:06:19.980> like<00:06:20.190> a<00:06:20.370> sliver<00:06:20.850> of<00:06:21.470> material

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:22.470 
about this is like a sliver of material

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:24.680 
about this is like a sliver of material
it<00:06:22.740> doesn't<00:06:23.190> even<00:06:23.250> cover<00:06:23.550> the<00:06:23.670> whole<00:06:24.120> heal<00:06:24.480> it

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:24.690 
it doesn't even cover the whole heal it

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:27.320 
it doesn't even cover the whole heal it
just<00:06:24.720> covers<00:06:25.020> like<00:06:25.380> the<00:06:26.010> back<00:06:26.340> so<00:06:26.730> it<00:06:27.120> feels

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:27.330 
just covers like the back so it feels

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:29.690 
just covers like the back so it feels
kind<00:06:27.630> of<00:06:27.690> strange<00:06:27.870> but<00:06:28.710> hopefully<00:06:29.460> I'll<00:06:29.580> get
