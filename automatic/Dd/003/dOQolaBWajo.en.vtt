00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.449
 race he won the criterium of the 3 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.449

 gaston brunet that sense that this test 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.030
 at war is not a goal for him 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.989
 Briefly it looks a priori difficult to 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.969
 ahead is the 15 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:42.120

 Criterium of 4 years the eleven deschamps 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.570

 performance in the test aratories him 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.230

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.100
 investigation 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.479
 it's one to a very first horse 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.909
 plan he will lead the opposition in 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.140
 company of 13 athletissima who told me 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.640
 much better in the reserved preparatory 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.500
 to fillies and finish third in 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.360
 effect of the price gaston de wazières and this to 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.740
 the favor of a noted end of the race 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.240
 if he can benefit from a good career 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:20.470
 hidden his final speed spike 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.990
 should wreak havoc 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:26.440
 the twelfth duquesne companion 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:27.460

 of an event disputed at the beginning of February 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:40.060
 confirmation that if expected the 16th it's 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:41.530
 to whom even green ducas who no longer has to 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.960
 prove itself in groups i 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:46.270

 before one hundred 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.840
 little but all in all quite surely 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.659
 called cima she finds here the 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.950
 number 6 ie jocelyn she a 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.710
 horse that was spared by the city

 with always esteemed by within his 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.050
 entourage 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:05.400
 it comes back to the level of 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:07.560
 groupings with strong ambitions 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:09.209
 at least for obtaining a 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.360
 beautiful place him who had been unhappy 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:14.280
 in my youth the criterion 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.870
 number five is atos of the elves who 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.420
 find the course of his last 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:21.420
 success that obtained in the prize phaeton 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:23.400
 a semi-classical level test and 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.350
 who has hard horse riding to 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.430
 the effort that in my opinion can do well 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:28.080
 in this lot it can make the reports worse 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.459
 he who can recommend a pronoun 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.910
 13.7 on the course that we 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:32.269
 interested

 encrypted summary for this competition 

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:40.290
 15 11 13 12 16 10 6 and 5 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:42.300
 for resuming the program 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.010
 vincennes in the first and well 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.239
 philippe 13th much the 108 avatar 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.070
 battle a horse that brought him from 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:48.660
 satisfaction during the 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:50.790
 last weeks aligning several 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:52.350
 success he must forgive her 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.400
 recent disqualification the horse is 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:54.989
 hard to effort he is able to 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.370
 settle in first and resist 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:56.970
 many attacks in my opinion you can 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.530
 go far enough 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:00.630
 I will ask him, however, the 115 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.130
 archibald a horse that has yet 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:03.510
 never won at vincennes but who 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:05.370
 has two lines of lines 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:07.230
 interesting in the province the horse is 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:08.850
 a son of monique horta who in my opinion 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:10.799
 should age very well it has been 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:12.000
 arranged by the Levac team and here it 

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:14.280
 promises to be formidable because the commitment 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:18.090
 is quite favorable is 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:19.620
 interesting 115-108 in the next the 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:21.540
 207 coire and gauthier that I have you 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:23.220
 already indicated several times that has 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:25.410
 won several of his last 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:26.910
 attempts goes back to vincennes with 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:28.920
 ambitions the horse is at best he did 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:30.480
 never been so powerful and powerful 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.829
 that it is at this age of 10 fabrice 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.930
 rush his mentor does a great job 

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:35.340
 the horse is aging very well and despite 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:36.930
 his distance performance he can 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:39.420
 finish on the podium 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:41.940
 the opposition the 210 remember jihem who 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:44.970
 remains on three consecutive podiums under 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:46.890
 the saddle and the 201 uppercut two innings 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:48.890
 by the earnings gap that stays him on 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:51.110
 two successes and who hears it well 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:53.300
 is confirmed he will benefit from a 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:56.390
 initial advantage of 25 meters on the 200 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:56.900
 it is such 210 201 207 210 in the 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:59.420
 third 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:02.000
 a nice match in perspective between two 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:03.380
 subjects invents a vanquished 306 landlord 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.730
 of sina son of rieussec who counts 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:05.209
 four wins in as many outings 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:07.580
 public 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:09.500
 same topo for 304 bros troubadours 

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:12.410
 four wins in as many 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:15.020
 benefits so one of the two should 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:17.750
 losing one's invincibility at the end of 

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:20.419
 this test 306 304 is in ambush 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:22.280
 we will be wary of the 307 it's bamako 

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:23.810
 angles also estimated by his 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:26.090
 surrounding the horse already has six 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:27.230
 podiums in seven races run 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:28.850
 he is a first-time suitor 

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:31.400
 places so notice to lovers to pair 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:34.280
 what order 304 6 7 to why not try 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:36.650
 in different orders in the fourth 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:38.150
 the 403th recoil of eating erases a 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:40.820
 favorable engagement she faces her 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:42.740
 seniors the lot at his fingertips for this 

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:44.150
 6 year old mare has always been good at 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:45.560
 been complicated at the beginning at the beginning of 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:46.760
 career but it seems to progress 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:48.560
 in this area and in my opinion in this 

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:49.970
 lot it looks daunting la de la 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:51.680
 holding she is hard to effort is everything 

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:54.140
 simply she is good and sparing by 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:56.150
 the verva family 403 urs he had to eat 

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:58.760
 I finish with a last favorite 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:59.990
 it will be 903 your dream of chaos that 

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:01.070
 better than these two 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:02.750
 last disqualifications 

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:04.040
 know that it will be sold out 

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:05.240
 later for this race which 

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:07.370
 is a goal 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:09.169
 Besides his last unshod 

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:12.650
 later has resulted in a 

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:14.600
 success it was January 11 in a 

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:16.700
 race well compose on the racecourse 

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:18.260
 of paris-vincennes so in this lot the 

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:20.419
 protected thomas family should 

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.890
 actively fight for all 

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:23.690
 first places 

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:27.380
 targeted race at vincennes on this saturday 

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:28.660
 1st 2nd 3rd 4th and 9th very good game to all 

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:30.660
 good start of weekend and 

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:30.660
