00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:07.040 
driving a motorcycle pardon my french
this<00:03:02.220> is<00:03:02.340> a<00:03:02.370> that's<00:03:02.760> a<00:03:02.850> fuel<00:03:03.120> pump<00:03:03.299> the<00:03:03.540> ad

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.050 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:08.300 

I<00:03:07.110> wonder<00:03:07.560> what<00:03:07.650> the<00:03:07.740> purpose<00:03:08.010> of<00:03:08.130> that<00:03:08.160> was

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
I wonder what the purpose of that was

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:11.870 
I wonder what the purpose of that was
for<00:03:08.730> back<00:03:08.820> in<00:03:08.850> 1937

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.730 

strange<00:03:12.660> they<00:03:12.870> roll

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:15.740 

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:20.190 

like<00:03:15.860> how<00:03:16.130> switches

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.220 

we<00:03:20.290> call<00:03:20.500> churches<00:03:21.040> from<00:03:21.250> houses

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230

so<00:03:25.939> I<00:03:26.000> guess<00:03:26.150> a<00:03:26.319> signal<00:03:27.430> probably<00:03:28.430> made<00:03:28.579> out<00:03:28.730> of

00:03:28.869 --> 00:03:28.879 
so I guess a signal probably made out of

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:33.009 
so I guess a signal probably made out of
your<00:03:29.269> washer<00:03:29.680> flip-flops<00:03:30.680> which<00:03:31.780> very<00:03:32.780> cool

the<00:06:27.580> world<00:06:27.759> and<00:06:28.120> put<00:06:28.300> a<00:06:28.360> single<00:06:28.719> hinge<00:06:28.870> down

00:06:29.129 --> 00:06:29.139 
the world and put a single hinge down

00:06:29.139 --> 00:06:31.200 
the world and put a single hinge down
the<00:06:29.289> middle<00:06:29.469> so<00:06:29.949> I<00:06:29.979> put<00:06:30.250> double<00:06:30.639> hinges<00:06:30.969> so<00:06:31.120> it

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:31.210 
the middle so I put double hinges so it

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:33.119 
the middle so I put double hinges so it
matches<00:06:31.509> the<00:06:31.810> shape<00:06:32.110> of<00:06:32.289> the<00:06:32.349> radiator<00:06:32.740> the

00:06:33.119 --> 00:06:33.129 
matches the shape of the radiator the

00:06:33.129 --> 00:06:35.459 
matches the shape of the radiator the
other<00:06:33.430> thing<00:06:33.699> I<00:06:33.819> did<00:06:33.879> is<00:06:34.479> I<00:06:34.719> move<00:06:34.990> the<00:06:35.289> engine

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:40.110 
transmission and firewall back 18 inches
just<00:06:38.589> that<00:06:38.919> insistent<00:06:39.430> tilt<00:06:39.639> sliding

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:40.120 
just that insistent tilt sliding

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:42.179 
just that insistent tilt sliding
everything<00:06:40.419> back<00:06:40.569> cutting<00:06:41.139> me<00:06:41.379> the<00:06:41.919> drive

00:06:42.179 --> 00:06:42.189 
everything back cutting me the drive

00:06:42.189 --> 00:06:44.939 
everything back cutting me the drive
shaft<00:06:42.550> 18<00:06:43.210> inches<00:06:43.569> and<00:06:43.719> that<00:06:44.199> did<00:06:44.469> two<00:06:44.650> things

00:06:44.939 --> 00:06:44.949 
shaft 18 inches and that did two things

00:06:44.949 --> 00:06:47.579 
shaft 18 inches and that did two things
it<00:06:45.099> gave<00:06:45.219> it<00:06:45.400> a<00:06:45.460> beautiful<00:06:45.849> long<00:06:46.270> nose<00:06:46.599> which

00:06:47.579 --> 00:06:47.589 
it gave it a beautiful long nose which

00:06:47.589 --> 00:06:50.790 
it gave it a beautiful long nose which
is<00:06:47.620> what<00:06:47.949> I<00:06:47.979> like<00:06:48.339> and<00:06:49.180> it<00:06:49.689> also<00:06:49.960> gave<00:06:50.469> it<00:06:50.620> a

00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:50.800 
is what I like and it also gave it a

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:53.640 
is what I like and it also gave it a
sports<00:06:51.219> car<00:06:51.639> weight<00:06:52.479> distribution<00:06:53.349> so<00:06:53.529> it

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:53.650 
sports car weight distribution so it

00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:55.589 
sports car weight distribution so it
handles<00:06:53.830> just<00:06:54.279> like<00:06:54.400> I<00:06:54.729> won't<00:06:54.909> say<00:06:55.120> a<00:06:55.150> Ferrari

00:06:55.589 --> 00:06:55.599

00:06:58.679 --> 00:06:58.689 
if it is it's a very very old Ferrari

00:06:58.689 --> 00:07:01.619 
if it is it's a very very old Ferrari
but<00:06:59.529> it<00:06:59.710> handles<00:07:00.129> awfully<00:07:00.669> well<00:07:00.879> and<00:07:01.180> they're

00:07:01.619 --> 00:07:01.629 
but it handles awfully well and they're

00:07:01.629 --> 00:07:03.300 
but it handles awfully well and they're
just<00:07:01.870> beautiful<00:07:02.020> we<00:07:02.469> have<00:07:02.649> a<00:07:02.680> ball<00:07:02.979> of<00:07:03.189> them

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:05.620 
and when we sell them which we

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:07.679 
and when we sell them which we
eventually<00:07:05.860> will<00:07:06.370> what<00:07:06.849> I'm<00:07:06.969> going<00:07:07.210> to<00:07:07.270> do<00:07:07.449> is
