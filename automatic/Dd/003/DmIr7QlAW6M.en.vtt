 hello I'm giulio fs children's reporter 

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:49.199
 I'm at a very special and 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.670
 very hot place in the 

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:55.440
 Muellheizkraftwerk of the city 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:57.629
 frankfurt and the special you the fas 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.469
 Revenge works and lives here 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.469
 hello for her 

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:07.859
 my age full 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.310
 a colleague of the environment 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.850
 I am glad that we have the plant today 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:22.040
 best we can catch as well 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.479
 right here a dropped off because there is 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.370
 the garbage dumped in the bunker 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:33.910
 But first I have to give the helmet 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:33.910
 because afterwards later afterwards 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:49.660
 Around 250 rubbish cars load their garbage 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:49.660
 monday to friday every day from 8000 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:55.070
 but two million kilos well calculated 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.480
 I would say we go up now 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:59.590
 then you can go to the crane 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:59.590
 garbage workers arrive at the top 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:38.600
 probably connect the waste in the 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.250
 incinerator are on this page 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:44.300
 Although on the other side are again 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:47.950
 but it is always only three in 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:47.950
 operation is still a reserve 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:03:00.700
 But what are just 5000 kilo that 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:00.700
 are three cars 

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:23.740
 July will continue 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:50.940
 calm that is hot on that too 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:54.129
 than at least 850 degrees and his toughe 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:57.069
 burned pretty much what is left 

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:58.720
 is this slag what happens then 

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:01.120
 She comes in a treatment plant 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:02.709
 There, the metals are taken out and 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:04.500
 what's left is in the road construction 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:08.340
 used 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:08.340
 England is seen at home 

00:04:41.259 --> 00:04:46.220
 juli you have now seen everything what you 

00:04:43.819 --> 00:04:48.879
 in the akw from the outside can see but in the 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:51.289
 hidden things happen much more 

00:04:48.879 --> 00:04:53.419
 prestige old but please turn on the light 

00:04:51.289 --> 00:04:55.909
 We produce electricity and heat 

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:58.009
 and that works so this blue 

00:04:55.909 --> 00:04:59.810
 pipes are filled with water like you 

00:04:58.009 --> 00:05:01.939
 you can see the tubes are in here, too 

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:03.500
 Upper part of the hot combustion furnace 

00:05:01.939 --> 00:05:05.919
 Do you know what happens when water 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:09.110
 is heated 

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:11.270
 right in the red tubes is now the 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:13.340
 steam goes to the power plant and 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:15.379
 operates this turbine and is doing so 

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:18.289
 electricity is produced and the electricity goes in 

00:05:15.379 --> 00:05:20.509
 flats yes almost 30,000 flats 

00:05:18.289 --> 00:05:22.520
 get your stream from us and not 

00:05:20.509 --> 00:05:25.099
 only electricity but also heat in winter 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:25.610
 for the heating should and what is that 

00:05:25.099 --> 00:05:27.919
 here still 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:29.979
 This will be the smoke gases at 

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:33.050
 Our combustion is cleansed 

00:05:29.979 --> 00:05:37.629
 then there is the air strengthen came out top 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:37.629
 chimney comes out nice and clean 

00:05:41.199 --> 00:05:44.289
 Many Thanks
