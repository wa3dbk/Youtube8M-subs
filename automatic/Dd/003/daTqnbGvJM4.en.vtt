00:00:01.819 --> 00:00:01.829 
hey guys just a quick video to show you

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:03.649 
hey guys just a quick video to show you
how<00:00:01.979> to<00:00:02.010> solve<00:00:02.310> problems<00:00:02.460> with<00:00:03.000> applications

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:03.659 
how to solve problems with applications

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:05.840 
how to solve problems with applications
not<00:00:03.870> showing<00:00:04.230> up<00:00:04.350> in<00:00:04.529> launchpad<00:00:05.130> now<00:00:05.700> this

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:05.850 
not showing up in launchpad now this

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:07.039 
not showing up in launchpad now this
isn't<00:00:06.000> a<00:00:06.089> proper<00:00:06.330> fix<00:00:06.569> but<00:00:06.810> it<00:00:06.899> is<00:00:07.020> a

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
isn't a proper fix but it is a

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:08.870 
isn't a proper fix but it is a
workaround<00:00:07.649> to<00:00:07.950> get<00:00:08.069> it<00:00:08.160> working<00:00:08.490> with<00:00:08.610> any

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
workaround to get it working with any

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.820 
workaround to get it working with any
application<00:00:09.450> so<00:00:10.230> I've<00:00:10.290> just<00:00:10.349> installed<00:00:10.769> a

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
application so I've just installed a

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.499 
application so I've just installed a
piece<00:00:10.980> of<00:00:11.160> software<00:00:11.400> called<00:00:11.490> magic<00:00:12.059> Q<00:00:12.330> which

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
piece of software called magic Q which

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:15.140 
piece of software called magic Q which
is<00:00:12.540> sham<00:00:12.900> sis<00:00:13.139> lighting<00:00:13.559> software<00:00:14.089> this<00:00:15.089> is

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
is sham sis lighting software this is

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:16.849 
is sham sis lighting software this is
the<00:00:15.269> application<00:00:15.389> near<00:00:15.870> magic<00:00:16.230> Q<00:00:16.500> and<00:00:16.650> is<00:00:16.710> also

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
the application near magic Q and is also

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.580 
the application near magic Q and is also
magic<00:00:17.340> vis<00:00:17.640> now<00:00:18.570> install<00:00:19.050> the<00:00:19.140> software<00:00:19.289> and

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
magic vis now install the software and

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:20.900 
magic vis now install the software and
it's<00:00:19.740> sitting<00:00:20.010> in<00:00:20.130> a<00:00:20.220> folder<00:00:20.550> within<00:00:20.699> my

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
it's sitting in a folder within my

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.640 
it's sitting in a folder within my
Applications<00:00:21.420> folder<00:00:21.480> so<00:00:22.289> it<00:00:22.380> should<00:00:22.560> be

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
Applications folder so it should be

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.529 
Applications folder so it should be
coming<00:00:22.920> up<00:00:23.010> under<00:00:23.310> launchpad<00:00:23.730> but<00:00:24.000> there<00:00:24.420> is

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
coming up under launchpad but there is

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.000 
coming up under launchpad but there is
no<00:00:24.750> application<00:00:24.930> here<00:00:25.500> I've<00:00:25.619> just<00:00:25.650> installed

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
no application here I've just installed

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.380 
no application here I've just installed
the<00:00:26.189> software<00:00:26.340> and<00:00:26.730> the<00:00:26.820> application<00:00:27.300> is

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
the software and the application is

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.240 
the software and the application is
missing<00:00:27.779> so<00:00:28.320> there's<00:00:28.500> a<00:00:28.560> really<00:00:28.740> easy<00:00:29.010> way<00:00:29.220> to

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
missing so there's a really easy way to

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.950 
missing so there's a really easy way to
solve<00:00:29.640> this<00:00:29.820> and<00:00:30.060> first<00:00:30.300> we<00:00:30.420> need<00:00:30.570> to<00:00:30.630> go<00:00:30.779> up<00:00:30.929> to

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
solve this and first we need to go up to

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.770 
solve this and first we need to go up to
another<00:00:31.230> application<00:00:31.619> called<00:00:32.009> Automator<00:00:32.910> now

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
another application called Automator now

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.299 
another application called Automator now
this<00:00:33.899> application<00:00:34.050> comes<00:00:34.590> built-in<00:00:34.950> on<00:00:35.130> all

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
this application comes built-in on all

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.310 
this application comes built-in on all
Macs<00:00:35.579> so<00:00:36.149> what<00:00:36.239> you<00:00:36.300> need<00:00:36.390> to<00:00:36.480> do<00:00:36.570> is<00:00:36.750> just<00:00:36.930> open

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
Macs so what you need to do is just open

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.650 
Macs so what you need to do is just open
it<00:00:37.350> up<00:00:37.969> and<00:00:38.969> it's<00:00:39.149> going<00:00:39.239> to<00:00:39.300> come<00:00:39.450> up<00:00:39.570> with

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
it up and it's going to come up with

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:40.850 
it up and it's going to come up with
this<00:00:39.750> screen<00:00:40.020> we<00:00:40.140> want<00:00:40.290> to<00:00:40.379> create<00:00:40.530> a<00:00:40.649> new

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
this screen we want to create a new

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.580 
this screen we want to create a new
document<00:00:41.870> and<00:00:42.870> we<00:00:43.050> want<00:00:43.230> to<00:00:43.290> create<00:00:43.440> an

document and we want to create an

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.920 
document and we want to create an
application<00:00:43.820> just<00:00:44.820> click<00:00:44.940> that<00:00:45.239> it<00:00:45.600> choose

and then up in the search bar here type
in<00:00:48.539> launch<00:00:48.829> and<00:00:49.829> we'll<00:00:49.950> get<00:00:50.070> launch

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
in launch and we'll get launch

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.430 
in launch and we'll get launch

going to launch pad you'll see that the
application<00:01:30.689> should<00:01:30.810> just<00:01:31.020> pop<00:01:31.140> up<00:01:31.350> and<00:01:32.310> there

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
application should just pop up and there

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.219 
application should just pop up and there
you<00:01:32.579> go<00:01:32.670> you<00:01:33.119> can<00:01:33.150> now<00:01:33.360> open<00:01:33.659> it<00:01:33.780> up<00:01:33.900> black

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:42.290 
file so it does show up in launchpad and

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:44.870 
file so it does show up in launchpad and
now<00:01:43.290> we<00:01:43.350> can<00:01:43.619> go<00:01:43.740> back<00:01:43.770> into<00:01:44.100> our<00:01:44.189> Applications

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
now we can go back into our Applications

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
the icon so now we go back into

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:10.190 
the icon so now we go back into
Launchpad<00:02:07.849> the<00:02:08.849> icon<00:02:09.149> should<00:02:09.360> update<00:02:09.509> like

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
opening the application even though

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:16.650 
opening the application even though
you're<00:02:15.130> opening<00:02:15.430> an<00:02:15.520> automated<00:02:16.000> file<00:02:16.330> to<00:02:16.480> do

so so that's it really simply how you
can<00:02:19.180> get<00:02:19.270> applications<00:02:19.420> that<00:02:19.900> aren't<00:02:20.140> showing

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
can get applications that aren't showing

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.530 
can get applications that aren't showing
up<00:02:20.410> in<00:02:20.530> launchpad<00:02:20.950> to<00:02:21.430> show<00:02:21.580> up<00:02:21.700> thanks<00:02:22.450> for

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540
