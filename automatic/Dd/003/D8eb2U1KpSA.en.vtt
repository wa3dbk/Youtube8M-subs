 I've been recording something about something, but I've been feeling a lot like this before. 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:41.460

 Even if I go abroad to overseas and now go to overseas performances, 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:01:00.239
 We have a lot of Korean food 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:01.739

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:27.330
 The No. Well're supposed to not play well in the usual wet gap can now rival the feast 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:28.680
 Seems like more delicious food such as my mother is also another move, 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:33.570
 It is. 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:37.950

 This is what we say at once. 1 2 3 4 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:07.440
 Yes, it is more like a mother who plays the mother of our team.

 My son-in-law always gets up first and we wake up and then 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:25.770
 They can give me value for the law, clean it, 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:26.640

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:29.970
 Delicious thing 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:35.190
 It was a magical sex school. 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:39.900
 Yoriremazu is proud of his food. He is a friend of mine rather than this. 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:45.330
 The most diligent and self-catering friends . 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:49.520

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:57.220
 Situation or 4 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:03:04.120
 It looks like the transition is a little bit too beautiful to be colored. 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:08.290
 Head and brilliant colors, rather than something like that 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:15.450
 It's a little strange about the book. 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:21.070
 Haejwoya its oil yudeul way it got to be one yudeul shatters records show that something 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:23.830
 It's not that kind of gorgeous thing that makes you sullen . 

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:27.030
 The taste is as good as the minute 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:30.670
 I think that's the charm of Korean food. 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:36.099
 I am a foreigner 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:37.660

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:41.470

 It's just that the mark picture is drawn as it is in the evil cartoon . 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:51.819
 I am always so far away from what I am now, but with my mother now 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:55.959
 Far away from the family, but always go back to the hometown and give that mother's 

00:03:51.819 --> 00:04:00.640
 When you eat a delicious meal night was young I painted that picture the old film

 Then some Korean food should give us our memories again . 

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:12.849
