 indicated that the exchange was made 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:52.170
 operations themselves take time at all 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.600
 a little somewhere between five and thirty 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.250
 but my average goes somewhere from 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:00.540
 five to ten minutes 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:03.119
 based on practice after us on 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:06.600
 Mail has received a letter that our money 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:11.610
 rubles changed to check we go back 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:12.989
 in exchange and already our receipt depending on 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:17.239

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:20.540

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:21.959

 Our check amount is specified in 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:34.410
 letter on our mail 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:37.170
 we see with an automatic machine what we get on our 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:39.299
 share the wallet again 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:42.120
 details click continue 

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:44.549
 if for some reason the translation is not 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:47.330
 happened automatically 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:50.040
 the service itself tell us about it and 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:52.350
 ask to write a data letter 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:55.650
 the person we received our mail 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:57.900
 on their mail which they will indicate after 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:01.260
 after we send the data found 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:04.109
 webmoney check and the post of 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:07.350
 service within 50 minutes they 

00:03:04.109 --> 00:03:09.989
 will automatically produce it so not 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:13.470
 But in principle, this is one of the ways 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:16.500
