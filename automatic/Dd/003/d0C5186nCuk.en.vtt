mean<00:05:05.190> the<00:05:05.670> no<00:05:06.030> big<00:05:06.210> deal<00:05:06.360> though<00:05:06.570> we<00:05:06.690> could

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:06.840 
mean the no big deal though we could

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:08.570 
mean the no big deal though we could
easily<00:05:07.170> just<00:05:07.350> that<00:05:07.650> by<00:05:07.800> putting<00:05:08.040> someone<00:05:08.370> into

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:08.580

way<00:06:37.020> more<00:06:37.050> yard<00:06:37.440> loose<00:06:37.650> then<00:06:37.890> they<00:06:38.040> would<00:06:38.250> have

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:38.910 
way more yard loose then they would have

way more yard loose then they would have
if<00:06:39.150> you<00:06:39.240> didn't<00:06:39.600> pass<00:06:39.780> them<00:06:40.020> it<00:06:40.170> so<00:06:40.470> it's<00:06:40.650> not<00:06:40.740> a

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:41.100 
if you didn't pass them it so it's not a

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:43.580 
if you didn't pass them it so it's not a
huge<00:06:41.280> difference<00:06:41.790> you<00:06:42.360> know<00:06:42.510> either<00:06:42.720> way<00:06:43.050> but

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:43.590 
huge difference you know either way but

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:46.640 
huge difference you know either way but
