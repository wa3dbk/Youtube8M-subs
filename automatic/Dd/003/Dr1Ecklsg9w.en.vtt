00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:06.330
 physical training in our system 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:08.519
 also somewhat different from why 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.440
 accustomed to people involved in fighting 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:16.139
 arts or just physical 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:18.539
 development of great physical strength and weight 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.490
 these are powerful arguments in hand-to-hand 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:24.510
 scramble 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:26.279
 but not the most important they should 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.960
 accompanied by such significant 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.720
 physical qualities as soon as 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:34.110
 power endurance sharpness speed 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:36.300
 in all these qualities strength sharpness 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.870
 speed and pace power endurance on 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.809
 one person goes very rare and 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.920
 exercise which we will now show 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:47.309
 allow you to develop these qualities in 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:53.550
 complex a few words about the order 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:56.670
 exercise to start the lines 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.500
 repeat in each exercise somewhere through 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:03.030
 two weeks when you can easily 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:06.749
 do it is necessary to add one at a time 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:09.299
 a week but exercise should 

00:01:06.749 --> 00:01:11.420
 run at maximum speed on 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:14.100
 maximum range of motion 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:17.329
 got between repetitions and between 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:20.599
 good luck exercises 

00:01:17.329 --> 00:01:23.579
 this exercise is called coincidence 

00:01:20.599 --> 00:01:26.609
 as you can see performer but not squat 

00:01:23.579 --> 00:01:30.689
 picks up his legs and falls sharply 

00:01:26.609 --> 00:01:33.179
 to the full depth reaching the bottom 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:36.709
 a line without delay powerful push legs 

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:40.169
 comes out again the top rack 

00:01:36.709 --> 00:01:42.090
 here he wring out his fists on the batter 

00:01:40.169 --> 00:01:45.829
 fist surface about this we say 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:50.310
 later here on all five fingers 

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:52.169
 paying attention then to 4 fingers hno3 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.950
 and so on I pay attention that the nails 

00:01:52.169 --> 00:01:55.850
 should be straight 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:58.649
 work to the full amplitude 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:04.130
 here the performer shrinks in three fingers 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:06.750
 and wrung out on the tourist frame brush 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:08.819
 again straighten elbow to the end 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:13.220
 now transitions from the back of the hand 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:13.220
 on food the surface of the fist and 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:18.090
 worked out the back in general back 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:23.129
 body surfaces like that 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:25.349
 deflections now shutter speed is so 

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:28.080
 seconds how many repetitions we do on 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:29.790
 exercise now it's time to work 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.150
 front surface of the body first 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:37.380
 queue abdominals 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:39.780
 horizontal scissors leg turns 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:42.870
 more precisely the rotation of the legs horizontal 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:47.310
 scissors twisted legs rotation 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:49.890
 right and left you need to lean your hands 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:54.530
 in the back you can keep balance 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:54.530
 hand -drawn vertical scissors 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:03.140
 in this exercise the main thing is not to tear off 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:05.210
 arm off the floor except the load on the abdominal 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:09.040
 the press is very good break 

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:09.040
 spinal flexibility developed 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:15.590
 here is the same compatibility load 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:18.380
 on came press is being worked out 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:22.910
 spine socks need to try 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:23.570
 get to the floor behind the head here and you can 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:27.020
 pull out 

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:29.030
 forward can be lowered down on this 

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:32.320
 exercise you need to get a new one between 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:35.090
 feet elbows further as to measure 

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:36.710
 Improvements in physical condition 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:38.660
 get alternately right and left 

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:41.630
 elbow or twist the body 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:43.910
 on exercise during this exercise 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:45.850
 the main thing is not to keep the elbows in the asset 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:48.110
 to be widely divorced 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:48.890
 Completed complex with godparents 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:51.340
 jumps 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:53.810
 rotating the brushes right and left with 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:56.570
 desire once clenching fists 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:59.060
 as you can see in three minutes the performer 

00:03:56.570 --> 00:04:00.980
 got a load on all the ligament muscles and 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:02.990
 cardiovascular joints and 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:05.380
 respiratory systems not inferior 

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:07.910
 loads from one hour jogging 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:08.420
 the mouse massaged all the internal 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:10.910
 organs 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:14.380
 developed all skeletal joints 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:14.380
 including the spine
