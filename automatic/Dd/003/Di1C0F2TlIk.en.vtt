00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:03.550
 Y 

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:11.510
 hello everyone hello javi we love 

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:14.480
 have you here again and be here 

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:16.219
 so we like and says all 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:17.990
 Bugs in the wild are necessary 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:20.840
 not the big ones the little insects 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:22.370
 but there are some that are very annoying and 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:25.250
 that can even bring diseases 

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:27.510
 as for example the flies especially 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:29.340
 in summer they are very heavy 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.350
 here is they are always giving palme 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:35.010
 all that is what we are going to do 

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:36.420
 trap for flies because of course we have already 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.090
 made a trap earlier that is 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.830
 for mosquitoes and in short the 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.960
 mechanics is the same the difference is 

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:44.670
 that the content does not why because the 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.860
 mosquitoes are attracted to the dioxide 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.860
 carbon that flies the flies are 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:52.620
 like us greedy and what is going for them is 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:55.340
 the sugar sugar so that by the 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.090
 Fly Trap Let's see let's 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:59.340
 comment 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.900
 when everyone has a bottle 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.050
 empty at home of any kind of 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:06.870
 refresh then what we do is that 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:10.320
 we select them with a feature 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:13.500
 very important and is that when sectioning what 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.510
 we have to go over the curve because if 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.130
 what we did on this part would be 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:20.430
 too narrow and we would be placed to 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:22.410
 the time to turn it upside down exactly is 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.360
 so we look for the curve 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:26.100
 then let's move on to explain the 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.399
 ingredients 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:32.340
 we have the quarter cup 

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:35.430
 white vinegar cider vinegar are not 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:38.080
 the target effectively we have four 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:41.350
 tablespoons of sugar 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:44.370
 a cup of water 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:48.740
 very ripe banana 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:48.740
 a spoon and a funnel 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:57.120
 we went to should be I guess to attract 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.470
 also to tiny flies is that 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:00.870
 They are also very bad fruit fly 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:03.630
 who calls him is like that is not to say 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:06.750
 necessary that we put the 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.610
 vinegar ingredient always because 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.979
 this is rather it would be oriented to the 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.690
 as silvia says the tiny fly of 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:16.100
 the fruit in case we put it on 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.100
 we mark them 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:25.470
 we will be putting in 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:27.710
 concretely now we are going to throw the 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:31.850
 sugar and now if you help me silvia 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:31.850
 naturally I in my hand 

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:41.900
 we are doing very homogeneous the 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:46.730
 liquid so that it is well mixed 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:48.710
 here we have sugar molasses and now 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:51.170
 ready to place the truth ingested 

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:53.860
 everything is clear and for that we take the 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.860
 funnel 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:03:00.330
 and we overturn 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:00.330
 you do not see 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:10.730
 this is here I put it serves very well 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:13.220
 second part 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:17.090
 we take this invention 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:19.750
 and we rub the banana 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:19.750
 what are you seeing 

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:25.790
 you are watching how I am doing it in 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:29.060
 spiral from the outside in 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:31.790
 I'm getting more and more silver a slight 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:33.560
 layer either and if it were not banana 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:36.220
 any very ripe fruit really very 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:39.570
 ripe and very sweet 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:39.570
 once we have it 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:47.030
 we drop the channel and now it has 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:49.640
 the trap has been made 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:51.500
 with the banana of silver will not come 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:55.910
 attracted flies and all kinds of 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:58.550
 insects will be drawn to eat the 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:04:00.350
 banana will stay floating in the water 

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:02.720
 they can not leave anymore because the wings are 

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:04.310
 they will get wet and in the case 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:07.400
 of wanting to escape 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:09.110
 you can take one directly clear 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:11.270
 that if I would never make a correct exit 

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:14.180
 very far here we have that trap for 

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:16.190
 flies and there's one even faster than 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:17.120
 it's the grandmother's field that says 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:18.680
 govern 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:20.269
 If you are in a hurry, hurry, hurry 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:22.669
 night you want the flies to 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:24.260
 bother take a little dish the analyzes 

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:25.970
 of milk from whole milk that have their 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:28.010
 Brasilia and put it on the bedside table 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:30.680
 you'll see that the next morning 

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:32.330
 the mosquitoes are gone to there 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:33.950
 look for the grease and such will be 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:36.169
 stuck with the legs are not going to 

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:38.060
 be able to fly and all the flies instead 

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:40.550
 to annoy you they are going to 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:42.830
 stay in the milk and throw a lot of clear 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:44.390
 here and good as we are not 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:45.950
 flies, we hope not to be the 

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:49.040
 annoying to you and keep living 

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:53.260
 all our videos are really many 

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:53.260
 thanks to thanks to silvia day
