00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
trying to install this into virtual box

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.080 
trying to install this into virtual box
and<00:00:18.449> I<00:00:19.439> always<00:00:19.770> get<00:00:19.980> the<00:00:20.160> same<00:00:20.310> question<00:00:20.850> hey

I'm getting this error code 5d why is
that<00:00:24.359> and<00:00:25.099> basically<00:00:26.099> this<00:00:26.490> happens<00:00:26.910> when

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
that and basically this happens when

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.540 
that and basically this happens when
you're<00:00:27.210> trying<00:00:27.750> to<00:00:27.930> install<00:00:28.410> off<00:00:28.800> of<00:00:29.130> the<00:00:29.250> disk

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
you're trying to install off of the disk

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.200 
you're trying to install off of the disk
from<00:00:30.150> the<00:00:30.300> iso<00:00:30.630> file<00:00:30.929> that<00:00:31.529> you<00:00:31.679> downloaded

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:32.210 
from the iso file that you downloaded

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:34.760 
from the iso file that you downloaded
now<00:00:33.210> remember<00:00:33.600> this<00:00:33.719> is<00:00:33.780> Windows<00:00:34.200> 10<00:00:34.440> preview

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
now remember this is Windows 10 preview

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.450 
now remember this is Windows 10 preview
and<00:00:35.190> as<00:00:36.149> of<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:36.600> recording<00:00:36.690> of<00:00:37.020> this<00:00:37.140> video

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:37.460 
and as of the recording of this video

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.459 
and as of the recording of this video
virtualbox<00:00:38.460> doesn't<00:00:38.910> know<00:00:39.180> what<00:00:39.780> Windows<00:00:40.140> 10

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
virtualbox doesn't know what Windows 10

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.069 
virtualbox doesn't know what Windows 10
is<00:00:40.980> so<00:00:41.879> there's<00:00:42.090> two<00:00:42.270> things<00:00:42.450> we<00:00:42.629> need<00:00:42.780> to<00:00:42.809> do

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
is so there's two things we need to do

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.709 
is so there's two things we need to do
one<00:00:43.800> you<00:00:44.579> need<00:00:44.730> to<00:00:44.850> make<00:00:44.969> sure<00:00:45.000> you're<00:00:45.420> running

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
one you need to make sure you're running

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.650 
one you need to make sure you're running
the<00:00:45.809> latest<00:00:45.989> version<00:00:46.230> of<00:00:46.860> virtualbox<00:00:47.520> and<00:00:48.059> to

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
the latest version of virtualbox and to

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.100 
the latest version of virtualbox and to
you<00:00:49.289> want<00:00:49.590> to<00:00:50.059> reconfigure<00:00:51.059> your<00:00:51.480> virtual

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
you want to reconfigure your virtual

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.010 
you want to reconfigure your virtual
machine<00:00:52.469> with<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:52.800> proper<00:00:53.190> settings<00:00:53.640> so<00:00:54.449> this

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
machine with the proper settings so this

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.959 
machine with the proper settings so this
particular<00:00:55.230> virtual<00:00:55.980> machine<00:00:56.309> is<00:00:56.489> called<00:00:56.670> win

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
you see the error so I've emulated the

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.520 
you see the error so I've emulated the
problem<00:01:02.750> now<00:01:03.750> the<00:01:03.870> first<00:01:04.049> thing<00:01:04.199> you<00:01:04.350> want<00:01:04.500> to

do is you want to check out your version

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.340 
do is you want to check out your version
if<00:01:06.030> you<00:01:06.090> go<00:01:06.180> to<00:01:06.240> help<00:01:06.540> and<00:01:06.810> go<00:01:06.960> to<00:01:06.990> about

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
if you go to help and go to about

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.039 
if you go to help and go to about
VirtualBox<00:01:08.130> you<00:01:08.820> could<00:01:09.030> see<00:01:09.210> your<00:01:09.479> version<00:01:09.930> at

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
VirtualBox you could see your version at

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.929 
VirtualBox you could see your version at
the<00:01:10.170> bottom<00:01:10.500> here<00:01:10.740> you<00:01:10.890> want<00:01:11.549> to<00:01:11.640> be<00:01:11.760> running

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
the bottom here you want to be running

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.770 
the bottom here you want to be running
version<00:01:12.510> 4.3<00:01:13.350> or<00:01:14.010> higher<00:01:14.549> if<00:01:14.939> you're<00:01:15.659> running

anything<00:01:16.140> less<00:01:16.500> than<00:01:16.710> 4.3<00:01:17.280> then<00:01:17.970> VirtualBox

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
anything less than 4.3 then VirtualBox

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.539 
anything less than 4.3 then VirtualBox
won't<00:01:18.930> be<00:01:19.049> able<00:01:19.170> to<00:01:19.259> recognize<00:01:19.619> the<00:01:20.040> software

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
won't be able to recognize the software

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.020 
won't be able to recognize the software
properly<00:01:21.119> in<00:01:21.299> fact<00:01:22.049> anything<00:01:22.860> prior<00:01:23.460> to

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
properly in fact anything prior to

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.980 
properly in fact anything prior to
version<00:01:24.210> 4.3<00:01:25.400> doesn't<00:01:26.400> even<00:01:26.610> recognize

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:26.990 
version 4.3 doesn't even recognize

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:31.310 
version 4.3 doesn't even recognize
Windows<00:01:27.990> 8.1<00:01:29.450> so<00:01:30.450> you<00:01:30.570> definitely<00:01:30.930> want<00:01:31.290> to

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
Windows 8.1 so you definitely want to

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.289 
Windows 8.1 so you definitely want to
upgrade<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:32.009> software<00:01:32.250> and<00:01:32.729> when<00:01:32.850> you<00:01:32.939> do<00:01:33.090> so

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
upgrade the software and when you do so

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.179 
upgrade the software and when you do so
you'll<00:01:33.509> see<00:01:33.720> some<00:01:33.900> more<00:01:34.020> options<00:01:34.290> when<00:01:34.860> you

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
you'll see some more options when you

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.980 
you'll see some more options when you
create<00:01:35.640> the<00:01:35.820> virtual<00:01:35.970> machine<00:01:37.130> now<00:01:38.130> if<00:01:38.369> we

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 
create the virtual machine now if we

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:43.370 
create the virtual machine now if we
close<00:01:39.990> out<00:01:40.259> of<00:01:40.290> this<00:01:40.439> and<00:01:41.780> I'll<00:01:42.780> just<00:01:42.960> save<00:01:43.200> the

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
close out of this and I'll just save the

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.690 
close out of this and I'll just save the
machine<00:01:43.680> state<00:01:44.009> for<00:01:44.189> this<00:01:44.340> guy

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:45.700 
machine state for this guy

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.630 
machine state for this guy
and<00:01:45.820> you'll<00:01:46.600> see<00:01:46.750> a<00:01:46.780> list<00:01:46.990> of<00:01:47.229> virtualbox<00:01:47.950> VMS

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340 
running less than version 4.3 they won't

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.479 
running less than version 4.3 they won't
recognize<00:02:07.110> 8.1<00:02:08.110> they'll<00:02:08.500> only<00:02:08.649> go<00:02:08.890> up<00:02:08.920> to<00:02:09.190> 8

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:09.489 
recognize 8.1 they'll only go up to 8

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:11.789 
recognize 8.1 they'll only go up to 8
perhaps<00:02:10.030> so<00:02:10.959> you've<00:02:11.080> got<00:02:11.110> to<00:02:11.319> update<00:02:11.650> the

00:02:11.789 --> 00:02:11.799 
perhaps so you've got to update the

00:02:11.799 --> 00:02:14.610 
perhaps so you've got to update the
software<00:02:11.980> and<00:02:12.580> then<00:02:13.299> you<00:02:13.390> want<00:02:13.510> to<00:02:13.599> select<00:02:13.840> 8.1

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
software and then you want to select 8.1

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.289 
software and then you want to select 8.1
and<00:02:14.980> of<00:02:15.160> course<00:02:15.370> you<00:02:15.519> decide<00:02:15.819> whether<00:02:16.120> you're

00:02:16.289 --> 00:02:16.299 
and of course you decide whether you're

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:18.690 
and of course you decide whether you're
doing<00:02:16.390> a<00:02:16.540> 64<00:02:17.019> or<00:02:17.170> 32<00:02:17.440> bit<00:02:17.950> you're<00:02:18.190> most<00:02:18.430> likely

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
doing a 64 or 32 bit you're most likely

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.110 
doing a 64 or 32 bit you're most likely
doing<00:02:19.000> 64-bit<00:02:20.220> that's<00:02:21.220> your<00:02:21.459> main<00:02:21.580> setting

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
doing 64-bit that's your main setting

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.699 
doing 64-bit that's your main setting
there<00:02:22.299> that<00:02:22.540> you<00:02:22.660> want<00:02:22.780> to<00:02:22.959> change<00:02:23.260> make<00:02:23.560> sure

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:23.709 
there that you want to change make sure

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:26.309 
there that you want to change make sure
you're<00:02:23.920> running<00:02:24.130> Windows<00:02:24.400> 8.1<00:02:24.750> 64-bit<00:02:25.750> but

00:02:26.309 --> 00:02:26.319 
you're running Windows 8.1 64-bit but

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:29.120 
you're running Windows 8.1 64-bit but
there's<00:02:26.500> more<00:02:26.560> if<00:02:27.190> we<00:02:27.250> go<00:02:27.940> to<00:02:28.030> the<00:02:28.360> system

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
there's more if we go to the system

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:32.400 
there's more if we go to the system
section<00:02:30.130> here<00:02:30.549> and<00:02:30.780> we<00:02:31.780> look<00:02:31.989> down<00:02:32.110> at<00:02:32.319> the

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410 
section here and we look down at the

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:36.390 
section here and we look down at the
motherboard<00:02:33.690> chipset<00:02:35.010> we<00:02:36.010> want<00:02:36.190> to<00:02:36.250> make<00:02:36.370> sure

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
motherboard chipset we want to make sure

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.979 
motherboard chipset we want to make sure
we're<00:02:36.670> using<00:02:36.700> ich9<00:02:37.540> as<00:02:38.349> the<00:02:38.799> chipset<00:02:39.370> and<00:02:39.989> you

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:40.989 
we're using ich9 as the chipset and you

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:45.780 
we're using ich9 as the chipset and you
also<00:02:41.230> want<00:02:41.620> to<00:02:41.829> enable<00:02:42.340> IO<00:02:43.260> apic<00:02:44.260> in<00:02:44.790> addition

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
also want to enable IO apic in addition

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:48.569 
also want to enable IO apic in addition
if<00:02:46.060> we<00:02:46.180> go<00:02:46.299> to<00:02:46.390> the<00:02:46.480> processor<00:02:47.140> we<00:02:48.130> want<00:02:48.430> to

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:48.579 
if we go to the processor we want to

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:55.050 
if we go to the processor we want to
enable<00:02:48.849> pae<00:02:49.720> and<00:02:50.170> X<00:02:51.069> and<00:02:53.010> by<00:02:54.010> default<00:02:54.190> it<00:02:54.670> sets

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 
enable pae and X and by default it sets

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:57.479 
enable pae and X and by default it sets
you<00:02:55.209> to<00:02:55.299> one<00:02:55.540> cpu<00:02:56.200> you<00:02:56.530> can<00:02:56.709> change<00:02:57.010> it<00:02:57.160> to<00:02:57.190> four

00:02:57.479 --> 00:02:57.489 
you to one cpu you can change it to four

00:02:57.489 --> 00:02:59.430 
you to one cpu you can change it to four
cpus<00:02:57.760> if<00:02:58.180> you're<00:02:58.299> running<00:02:58.389> a<00:02:58.600> quad-core<00:02:58.900> or

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 
cpus if you're running a quad-core or

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.680 
cpus if you're running a quad-core or
something<00:02:59.739> like<00:02:59.859> that<00:02:59.920> and<00:03:00.420> finally<00:03:01.420> we<00:03:01.510> go<00:03:01.630> to

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 
something like that and finally we go to

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:04.140 
something like that and finally we go to
acceleration<00:03:02.319> and<00:03:02.769> we<00:03:03.310> want<00:03:03.489> to<00:03:03.579> enable<00:03:03.819> both

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150 
acceleration and we want to enable both

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:07.110 
acceleration and we want to enable both
of<00:03:04.389> these<00:03:05.010> so<00:03:06.010> that's<00:03:06.370> what<00:03:06.670> you<00:03:06.730> want<00:03:06.910> to<00:03:07.000> do

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
of these so that's what you want to do

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.819 
of these so that's what you want to do
you<00:03:07.269> want<00:03:07.450> to<00:03:07.510> go<00:03:07.630> to<00:03:07.690> motherboard<00:03:08.230> change<00:03:08.709> it

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:08.829 
you want to go to motherboard change it

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:12.080 
you want to go to motherboard change it
to<00:03:08.920> ich9<00:03:09.400> change<00:03:10.030> the<00:03:10.180> chipset<00:03:10.660> to<00:03:10.840> I<00:03:10.870> ch.9

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
to ich9 change the chipset to I ch.9

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:16.710 
to ich9 change the chipset to I ch.9
enable<00:03:13.090> IO<00:03:13.269> apic<00:03:14.170> and<00:03:14.549> in<00:03:15.549> a<00:03:15.639> processor<00:03:16.239> enable

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720 
enable IO apic and in a processor enable

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:21.449 
enable IO apic and in a processor enable
pae<00:03:17.109> and<00:03:17.500> X<00:03:17.950> and<00:03:19.109> an<00:03:20.109> acceleration<00:03:20.650> enable

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:21.459 
pae and X and an acceleration enable

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:24.360 
pae and X and an acceleration enable
both<00:03:21.579> of<00:03:21.790> these<00:03:22.650> but<00:03:23.650> the<00:03:23.739> most<00:03:23.889> important

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
both of these but the most important

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:26.910 
both of these but the most important
configuration<00:03:24.609> is<00:03:25.290> change<00:03:26.290> it<00:03:26.440> to<00:03:26.560> Windows

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:26.920 
configuration is change it to Windows

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.190 
configuration is change it to Windows
8.1<00:03:27.130> and<00:03:27.940> you<00:03:28.269> actually<00:03:28.420> have<00:03:28.690> to<00:03:28.810> set<00:03:29.049> this

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200 
8.1 and you actually have to set this

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.830 
8.1 and you actually have to set this
when<00:03:29.440> you<00:03:29.530> create<00:03:29.889> the<00:03:30.099> virtual<00:03:30.250> machine<00:03:30.840> so

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
when you create the virtual machine so

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.629 
when you create the virtual machine so
definitely<00:03:32.170> Windows<00:03:32.650> 8.1<00:03:32.829> is<00:03:33.340> the<00:03:33.430> one<00:03:33.549> you

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:33.639 
definitely Windows 8.1 is the one you

00:03:33.639 --> 00:03:36.059 
definitely Windows 8.1 is the one you
want<00:03:33.670> to<00:03:33.880> select<00:03:34.120> later<00:03:34.750> on<00:03:35.019> with<00:03:35.769> newer

00:03:36.059 --> 00:03:36.069 
want to select later on with newer

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:37.800 
want to select later on with newer
versions<00:03:36.549> of<00:03:36.609> virtualbox<00:03:37.000> you'll<00:03:37.510> see

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:37.810 
versions of virtualbox you'll see

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:39.809 
versions of virtualbox you'll see
Windows<00:03:38.380> 10<00:03:38.410> but<00:03:39.010> for<00:03:39.190> now<00:03:39.310> as<00:03:39.579> of<00:03:39.700> the

00:03:39.809 --> 00:03:39.819 
Windows 10 but for now as of the

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:42.030 
Windows 10 but for now as of the
recording<00:03:39.910> of<00:03:40.239> this<00:03:40.359> video<00:03:40.650> just<00:03:41.650> to<00:03:41.709> help<00:03:41.829> out

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:45.669 
want to select Windows 8.1 because

00:03:45.669 --> 00:03:49.080 
want to select Windows 8.1 because
that's<00:03:45.910> the<00:03:46.359> closest<00:03:47.230> version

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:49.090 
that's the closest version

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:50.670 
that's the closest version
and<00:03:49.180> of<00:03:49.540> course<00:03:49.569> versions<00:03:50.260> are<00:03:50.410> very

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:50.680 
and of course versions are very

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:54.570 
and of course versions are very
interesting<00:03:51.840> I'm<00:03:52.840> showing<00:03:53.590> a<00:03:53.739> screenshot<00:03:54.370> of

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:54.580 
interesting I'm showing a screenshot of

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:57.000 
interesting I'm showing a screenshot of
a<00:03:54.760> Windows<00:03:55.060> 10<00:03:55.330> system<00:03:55.840> that<00:03:56.170> actually<00:03:56.440> runs

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:57.010 
a Windows 10 system that actually runs

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:01.110 
a Windows 10 system that actually runs
in<00:03:57.430> virtual<00:03:57.940> in<00:03:58.379> VirtualBox<00:03:59.379> and<00:03:59.819> you<00:04:00.819> can<00:04:00.940> see

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:01.120 
in virtual in VirtualBox and you can see

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:02.940 
in virtual in VirtualBox and you can see
the<00:04:01.330> version<00:04:01.569> if<00:04:01.840> we<00:04:01.959> type<00:04:02.170> v<00:04:02.349> ER<00:04:02.680> and<00:04:02.860> the

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:02.950 
the version if we type v ER and the

command prompt is version 6.4 that's

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:09.240 
command prompt is version 6.4 that's
right<00:04:06.819> Windows<00:04:07.480> 10<00:04:07.750> is<00:04:07.780> version<00:04:08.349> 6.4<00:04:09.099> well

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:09.250 
right Windows 10 is version 6.4 well

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:11.309 
right Windows 10 is version 6.4 well
this<00:04:09.400> has<00:04:09.519> been<00:04:09.670> going<00:04:09.879> on<00:04:10.060> for<00:04:10.120> ages<00:04:10.420> the

00:04:11.309 --> 00:04:11.319 
this has been going on for ages the

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:13.680 
this has been going on for ages the
original<00:04:11.890> version<00:04:12.069> 6<00:04:12.700> was<00:04:13.150> Windows<00:04:13.510> Vista

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:13.690 
original version 6 was Windows Vista

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:17.310 
original version 6 was Windows Vista
then<00:04:14.650> you<00:04:14.830> had<00:04:15.040> windows<00:04:15.580> 7<00:04:15.970> was<00:04:16.120> 6.1<00:04:16.690> and<00:04:17.229> then

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:17.320 
then you had windows 7 was 6.1 and then

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:18.900 
then you had windows 7 was 6.1 and then
you<00:04:17.440> had<00:04:17.590> windows<00:04:17.949> 8<00:04:18.160> was<00:04:18.370> the<00:04:18.519> next<00:04:18.729> version

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:18.910 
you had windows 8 was the next version

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:21.469 
you had windows 8 was the next version
next<00:04:19.239> version<00:04:19.600> so<00:04:20.019> Windows<00:04:20.440> 10<00:04:20.709> is<00:04:20.739> actually

00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:21.479 
next version so Windows 10 is actually

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:25.920 
next version so Windows 10 is actually
6.4<00:04:22.479> is<00:04:23.430> it<00:04:24.430> all<00:04:24.580> that<00:04:24.639> much<00:04:25.270> different

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:25.930 
6.4 is it all that much different

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:30.180 
6.4 is it all that much different
architectural<00:04:26.770> II<00:04:27.040> than<00:04:27.400> Windows<00:04:27.910> 8.1<00:04:29.190> well

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:30.190 
architectural II than Windows 8.1 well

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:32.550 
architectural II than Windows 8.1 well
not<00:04:30.460> according<00:04:30.790> to<00:04:31.030> this<00:04:31.389> because<00:04:32.020> it's<00:04:32.380> only

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:32.560 
not according to this because it's only

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.500 
not according to this because it's only
a<00:04:32.680> point<00:04:33.040> release<00:04:33.340> different<00:04:33.850> it's<00:04:34.060> not<00:04:34.330> an

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:34.510 
a point release different it's not an

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:37.830 
a point release different it's not an
actual<00:04:34.690> version<00:04:35.229> number<00:04:35.470> different<00:04:36.220> so<00:04:36.840> you

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:37.840 
actual version number different so you

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:39.870 
actual version number different so you
know<00:04:37.960> the<00:04:38.169> closest<00:04:38.889> operating<00:04:39.460> systems<00:04:39.790> the

know the closest operating systems the

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:41.490 
know the closest operating systems the

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:41.500 
one you want to select in this case so

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:43.379
