00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 very good kids we are here in the 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:05.040
 My business's clash of clans channel 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.440
 some guys as you see I bring you a 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.330
 wifi attack a thing like that a bit 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.219
 different than what we normally are 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.620
 used to see and as you see then 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.299
 good I have three goals level 35 brujilla 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.430
 if a few cuffs few the 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.529
 true but good I wanted to see if with 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.869
 the witches is enough to get 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.740
 make a good attack the problem has 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.300
 changed in this attack is 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.619
 mainly that those break walls are 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.269
 throw a little bit more I would have to 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.949
 have waited for that mortarball 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.720
 fall for so well throw them away 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.669
 there and break the pure but good 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.739
 for a spell of rage just put there 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.390
 to end all those defenses 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.340
 and on top of the wall, well, they are 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.770
 pretty good although good most of 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.239
 skeletons have deviated a bit but 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.250
 they were there entertaining a 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.809
 poquillo to tesla etcetera and so the 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.879
 true, well, I was a little better 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.410
 the attack as you see a healing success 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.719
 over here just in case that mortar that 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.489
 there's that right side, well, well, 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.829
 kill me the witches and meanwhile then 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.750
 well I freeze this area here so that 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.390
 meanwhile the barbarian king along with 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.250
 the queen archer and other herds 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.750
 well go adding more percentage me 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.060
 I fell on those defenses and at least 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.860
 good the queen who was the arrive from 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.270
 behind the wall to knock me down 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.009
 City Hall as you see they have just 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.079
 lay down that mortar the queen archer 

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:14.490
 begins to plug in the town hall 

00:01:13.079 --> 00:01:17.250
 he used his ability to have me 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.140
 remove as soon as possible but does not have the 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.490
 enough force to knock him down so 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.439
 Well, I have to wait for those 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.869
 make up if those skeletons get 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:26.340
 knock me down the town hall they get 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.649
 knock me out the town hall the queen 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.750
 archer is laying down that tower of 

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:32.700
 archers begin to go all the 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.799
 trophies to the gold store and the 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.530
 really good the attack took me a 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:40.259
 good booty especially the xxi the curo 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.750
 plus the league bonus that like all 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:45.209
 you will know in this league of teachers level 2 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.220
 is 120 thousand resources of each at 

00:01:45.209 --> 00:01:48.509
 which is very, very good that the 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.630
 problem that good because it could have 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:53.399
 plus 50% but kill me those 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.080
 trophies from there on top it is archer and 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:56.729
 it could have done 48 percent 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.470
 but some guys I hope that I have 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.060
 liked this attack is a little different 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:02.280
 what we are used to seeing 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.170
 I will try to bring you along 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.640
 different weeks videos as you have 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.799
 seen in the schedule sorry if I have not 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.530
 I could meet today but I did not have 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:12.060
 practically time to be able to prepare 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.520
 videos and only 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.900
 well could have this attack leaves the 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:17.430

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.920

 throughout the week, be it 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:29.519
 good attacks with mixtures is worth as per 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:31.610
 example in this case then let's fly if 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:34.110
 only magicians or golems and witches or 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:36.300
