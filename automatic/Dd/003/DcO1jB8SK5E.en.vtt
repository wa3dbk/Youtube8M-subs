00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 and that is going to be Jorge vergara for the 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:07.350
 next tournament because I insist there 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.030
 many doubts still when a team of 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.650
 the category of the magnitude of chivas 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.019
 It is three points from the zone of 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.910
 descent I think something with those bulbs 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.650
 permanently lit reds have to 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.970
 do they should do something 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.310
 righ now 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.939
 but is that approved to invest will take 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:26.519
 because they have more home players 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.990
 beyond the investment that is intended 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.920
 It has to be important because it 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:33.630
 they sell expensive to chivas has to 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:35.489
 exchange players I think a 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.440
 nigris aldo in the system that they have 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.719
 current I do not know I do not know if it can work 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.820
 with more extremes in one time like this has 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.200
 presence but good something in go and I 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.050
 I think what several teams did 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.000
 and there to be able to do some exchange and 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.309
 out there some others the same chatón 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.899
 Enriquez, who at the time called a lot 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.090
 the attention of Bergara himself 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.579
 Promoted a lot can be played 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.590
 quoted can be counted games that 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.690
 they did not work that does not work and marked 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.250
 Fabián no longer worked in Chivas and 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.680
 work until what back 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.610
 what was not stable not that 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.610
 come back more can not go back 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:15.090
 but it would be we are talking about there 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.550
 players that for some reason having 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.010
 a lot of quality a lot of talent are not already 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:21.420
 surrendering in chivas those players who 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:24.210
 I think they do have something still 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.010
 quote can go to the times I 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:30.560
 I think the chatón enríquez can be 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:33.620
 a good currency and nothing else 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:39.080
 aldo de nigris I what has been 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:42.420
 operated or rafa marquez I do not think that the 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:45.780
 team is doing and everything plays well 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.610
 goals but he did not play well morelia that's why 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.590
 I did not put it in third place by dint of 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.200
 be mentioned names and the other then 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.490
 is to have money to buy them if 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.100
 they have money is the problem of chivas 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.010
 it's not that they do not have a line, I think 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.750
 chivas has to go through oribe peralta 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:02.820
 he has to go for the best players 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:06.720
 what's in the market has to go by 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:08.310
 very good containment come out of the 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:11.370
 chivas and they go to the selection case of 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.810
 ponce case of fabian like this happens with chivas 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.000
 something happens 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:24.090
 and it has to go for extremes I think that 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:26.970
 aldo de nigris gets tired because pablo 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:29.010
 barrier for example that stood out in pumas 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:31.380
 who went to play in England and who has 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:34.260
 already had two operations here or one 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:36.900
 second and that is recovering in core 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:39.120
 blue does not have the will and right now can 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:42.930
 be a player that exploded with the volpe 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:46.739
 It can be if if you look for it you need a 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:49.080
 goalkeeper experience I do not think he's 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:51.060
 it is better to invest in forwards and 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.590
 midfielders that a goalkeeper program 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.049
 if you have a coach that does have 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:57.360
 offensive vocation put together a team 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:59.700
 Arman offensive team really 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:01.290
 offensive with prestes will be made the 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.540
 president of day 4 runs to the 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:05.040
 volpe good to come that I think Jorge 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.510
 vergara beyond some 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.980
 contradictions that have had as everything 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:09.810
 the world I think he has always 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:12.810
 defended an offensive project always 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:14.120
 if he dares him as owner he always wants 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:18.590
 when 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:20.540
 brought arias arias arias has not gone all 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:23.239
 we criticized the world but there it was 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:26.200
 they say achar that was part of their 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:26.200
 advisory council
