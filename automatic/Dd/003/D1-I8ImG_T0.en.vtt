00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.060
 I found a new extravagant position 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:08.280
 to do this, I know it is the same 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.260
 chair of the previous video 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.639
 with the difference that it is no longer full 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:20.340
 like yesterday for those who were who they were 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:23.279
 above would you deserve the table e 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.650
 I ate my salad with the 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:30.179
 project ball historical head yes because 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:31.920
 I'm on a diet will say I was reflecting a 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.440
 little bit, however, while nibbled 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.390
 of phone calls received in 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.550
 days when one hypothetically 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.670
 should rest and phone calls 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:44.129
 they always come when it's done 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.530
 very late the previous night 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.719
 or when there are some festivities 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.430
 but I have red hair and 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.539
 morning and therefore you rightly want 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.699
 would sleep needle 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:56.820
 but suddenly the phone rings and 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:59.940
 they call us the most absurd people are 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:03.239
 several cases morning calls the first 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:06.210

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:09.619
 centers that call you for each 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:12.299

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:20.280

 in body and nobody gets up to respond 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.159
 because all the magically are 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.960

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.140
