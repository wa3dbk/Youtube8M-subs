00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:47.979 
fire out super fast so I was sitting how

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:49.789 
fire out super fast so I was sitting how
far<00:01:48.310> can<00:01:48.520> fire<00:01:48.790> myself<00:01:49.030> across<00:01:49.240> a<00:01:49.329> level

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
far can fire myself across a level

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.590 
far can fire myself across a level
because<00:01:50.799> I<00:01:50.829> reckon<00:01:51.250> at<00:01:51.310> that<00:01:51.430> speed<00:01:51.729> you<00:01:52.479> could

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:52.600 
because I reckon at that speed you could

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.039 
because I reckon at that speed you could
go<00:01:52.750> pretty<00:01:53.170> far<00:01:53.439> to<00:01:53.500> be<00:01:53.710> fur<00:01:54.150> so<00:01:55.150> that<00:01:55.420> see

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:56.049 
go pretty far to be fur so that see

00:01:56.049 --> 00:01:58.200 
go pretty far to be fur so that see
really<00:01:56.710> don't<00:01:56.979> always<00:01:57.340> reset<00:01:57.729> once<00:01:57.880> if<00:01:58.060> you

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.210 
really don't always reset once if you

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:59.819 
really don't always reset once if you
stay<00:01:58.360> on<00:01:58.420> the<00:01:58.509> same<00:01:58.689> stage<00:01:58.990> the<00:01:59.259> porters<00:01:59.619> won't

00:01:59.819 --> 00:01:59.829 
stay on the same stage the porters won't

00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:02.100 
stay on the same stage the porters won't
we<00:01:59.950> set<00:02:00.189> but<00:02:00.880> once<00:02:01.060> I<00:02:01.210> because<00:02:01.540> I<00:02:01.570> went<00:02:01.840> into

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.110 
we set but once I because I went into

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:04.770 
we set but once I because I went into
that<00:02:02.229> of<00:02:02.590> a<00:02:02.680> bit<00:02:02.829> it's<00:02:03.490> now<00:02:03.790> reset<00:02:04.240> so<00:02:04.479> the<00:02:04.600> blue

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:04.780 
that of a bit it's now reset so the blue

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:06.630 
that of a bit it's now reset so the blue
one<00:02:04.930> has<00:02:05.020> disappeared<00:02:05.470> but<00:02:06.340> that's<00:02:06.490> no

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 
one has disappeared but that's no

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.249 
one has disappeared but that's no
problem<00:02:06.909> let's<00:02:07.570> just<00:02:07.630> hammer<00:02:07.930> through<00:02:08.140> this

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:08.259 
problem let's just hammer through this

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:11.880 
problem let's just hammer through this
level<00:02:09.090> well<00:02:10.090> 101<00:02:10.569> and<00:02:11.200> pretty<00:02:11.620> sure<00:02:11.739> it's<00:02:11.860> the

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
level well 101 and pretty sure it's the

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:14.149
