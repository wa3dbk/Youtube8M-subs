just about that far and you make a

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.030 
just about that far and you make a
couple<00:01:16.979> of<00:01:17.189> different<00:01:17.670> ones<00:01:18.119> I<00:01:18.619> only<00:01:19.619> have<00:01:19.860> two

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
right now they go really far that way if

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.440 
right now they go really far that way if
you<00:01:22.920> look<00:01:23.040> on<00:01:23.220> my<00:01:23.250> map<00:01:23.580> you<00:01:23.820> actually<00:01:24.390> you

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
you look on my map you actually you

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
far I'll just turn my render distance up

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.490 
far I'll just turn my render distance up
too<00:01:27.869> far<00:01:28.700> and<00:01:29.700> I'll<00:01:29.820> show<00:01:30.150> you<00:01:30.290> what<00:01:31.290> it<00:01:31.350> looks
