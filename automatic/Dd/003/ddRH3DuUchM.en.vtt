00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:20.020

 felix and today I bring you back to the far cry 4 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:24.669
 with a compilation of self recca said 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:26.919
 that like all ubisoft games and is 

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:29.800
 very rich distere and references to 

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:33.820
 other games or things 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:36.520
 quite famous we begin immediately with the 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:38.530
 initial scene of doing 34 would be 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.420
 revenge the first scenes of park 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:42.280
 retequattro and like everyone else by now 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:44.260
 you know after these first initial scenes 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.879
 immediately the first easter egg is that of 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.289
 end of 15 minutes 

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:49.690
 if you don't know what I'm talking about 

00:00:47.289 --> 00:00:52.440
 see the video of the tubs 13 he has 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:54.640
 published some time ago channel 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.039
 however it is as you know in that easter 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:59.319
 egg must stay still for 

00:00:57.039 --> 00:01:01.780
 complete with selectin and use of 

00:00:59.319 --> 00:01:03.310
 alternative machine or move 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:05.260
 so do what 

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:07.000
 says the game to continue 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.560
 real adventure 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.120
 here are the first ones to stay even right here 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.980
 in fact at the end of this sequence 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:14.200
 animated feel of the very famous 

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:16.810
 song judas the growth votes of 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:19.210
 clash just should i stay or should i 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.230
 go you are literally will have to stay o 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:22.390
 I should leave 

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:25.210
 so here is the first other reference 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:31.270
 serebbe me the experience of the game and 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:33.670
 immediately to bomb here we are the boys of 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:34.900
 according to easter egg to see the 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:38.530
 coordinates look at the bottom right 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:40.150
 on the map this easter egg be 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:41.770
 to the world the cinema in 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:44.140
 particular to the film by nana jones e 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:44.890
 the last crusade in fact milan jones in 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.130
 that film 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:50.080
 the task of finding the sacred grail e 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:53.350
 this adventure of his is accompanied by 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:55.360
 another person and to find this 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:57.340
 place simply needs to albeit in 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.660
 so that is offering me and fencing 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:00.970
 you have to do a moment of parkour is 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:02.890
 followed this path once 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:04.479
 arrived you find the same scene that 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:06.280
 located in the jones and in the movie that is 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:10.450
 this table with many goblets e 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:14.200
 gold glasses in the movie his companion 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:16.570
 he is overwhelmed and killed transformed 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.130
 a skeleton with the head peeling off 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:21.010
 while in the jones it succeeds on the start 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:22.270
 because it immediately identifies the sacred grail 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.940
 here is the scene as you can see it 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:28.090
 parquet 4 was created recreated 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:30.819
 very faithfully here instead we lost 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:32.920
 would you guys just see here too 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:34.900
 on the map of the coordinates are many 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.060
 lower right with that ruin e 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:40.750
 very easily this house but 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:41.960
 attention here is protected by two hit men 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:44.480
 of pagans 

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:47.210
 so before you venture you do 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:50.210
 beware and kill this one would stand 

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:51.230
 instead it is dedicated to a very strong game 

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:54.520
 which is skyrim 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:58.580
 in fact in this the select will be at 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:03:00.230
 I refer to the famous man of the 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:02.210
 gene arrow or spans on play 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:04.160
 skyrim you will surely have met 

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:05.480
 someone who had also told me a 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.550
 time was an ice of comets e 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:08.810
 but now I had to stop because of me 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:11.150
 I got a knee arrow 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:13.400
 so this poor fellow here with the 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:15.470
 knee arrow and while the 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.810
 bucket on his head is a trick that 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:19.190
 use in skyrim to steal without being 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:20.870
 seen as we say just put a 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:23.270
 bucket in head in skyrim to be able to 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:26.830
 steal without being seen and here is the 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:26.830
 I refer to far cry as carne 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:30.650
 here is the guys with a dolly shot 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:33.430
 end of easter egg unfortunately they are not 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:36.350
 managed to bring veils the first whys 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:38.090
 hear the radio in English and I have the 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:40.880
 young Italian so I'm not 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:42.320
 then managed to wear veils and then those who hear 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:44.180
 let's say the radio in the version of 

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:46.490
 English game will hear to the speaker 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:48.020
 radio, however, not when it is 

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:50.270
 under the control of the ordinary of 

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:52.970
 pan am inn this whole sticker and that 

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:56.000
 will talk about me the ferrari you were bringing 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:59.150
 back to walker white and that is 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.650
 heinberg of brighi and is in this very much 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:04.010
 curious why ubisoft already had 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:06.560
 honored this TV series also in work 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:08.390
 stoxx is always via the radio yes 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:13.010
 will hear about the times of the 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:15.400
 president obama instead another easter 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:18.080
 egg recco are not share repair I have seen 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:20.670
 of photos of Rome not exempt you can not 

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:24.960
 what part of the map they were 

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:26.700
 that is, it will be this reference and the walls it is 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:30.150
 You can find writings with 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:34.370
 written pays 1200 I strap this reference 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:37.170
 clear and decisive to the 1984 book by orwell 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:39.720
 where there were writings in all the houses 

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:41.550
 all the places we say about the city ​​with 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:43.260
 written big brother is watching 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:46.440
 so let's say this reference 

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:48.330
 literary george orwell good boys the 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:51.030
