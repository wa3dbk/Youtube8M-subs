00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
see this is an XXL my original one is an

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:56.000 
see this is an XXL my original one is an
extra-large<00:03:53.209> this<00:03:54.209> one<00:03:54.600> is<00:03:55.019> roughly<00:03:55.500> four

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
extra-large this one is roughly four

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:58.380 
extra-large this one is roughly four
inches<00:03:56.660> shorter

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:58.390 
inches shorter

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:01.770 
inches shorter
my<00:03:58.600> extra-large<00:03:59.530> and<00:03:59.940> also<00:04:00.940> the<00:04:01.150> width<00:04:01.480> is

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:01.780 
my extra-large and also the width is

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:05.870 
my extra-large and also the width is
about<00:04:02.610> maybe<00:04:03.610> an<00:04:03.819> inch<00:04:04.090> or<00:04:04.300> so<00:04:04.510> and<00:04:04.540> width<00:04:05.140> from

about maybe an inch or so and width from
our<00:04:06.880> pathar<00:04:07.810> bit<00:04:08.080> shorter<00:04:08.590> so<00:04:09.040> it<00:04:09.130> actually

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:09.280 
our pathar bit shorter so it actually

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:13.380 
our pathar bit shorter so it actually
fits<00:04:09.819> smaller<00:04:10.450> than<00:04:11.230> my<00:04:11.470> extra-large<00:04:12.190> um<00:04:12.640> I

possible I've tried to live in a
research<00:04:27.400> and<00:04:27.640> homework<00:04:27.820> but<00:04:28.390> I<00:04:28.419> can't<00:04:28.900> find

00:04:29.159 --> 00:04:29.169 
research and homework but I can't find

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:31.710 
research and homework but I can't find
anything<00:04:29.590> about<00:04:29.830> that<00:04:30.220> but<00:04:30.970> you<00:04:31.120> know<00:04:31.270> like<00:04:31.600> I

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:31.720 
anything about that but you know like I

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:34.590 
anything about that but you know like I
said<00:04:31.780> I<00:04:32.050> mean<00:04:32.440> this<00:04:32.800> is<00:04:33.130> probably<00:04:33.550> if<00:04:34.090> it<00:04:34.390> is<00:04:34.570> a

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:34.600 
said I mean this is probably if it is a

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:38.040 
said I mean this is probably if it is a
knockoff<00:04:35.169> the<00:04:35.610> world's<00:04:36.610> greatest<00:04:37.060> knockoff<00:04:37.840> I

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:38.050 
knockoff the world's greatest knockoff I

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:40.140 
knockoff the world's greatest knockoff I
mean<00:04:38.230> whoever<00:04:38.680> made<00:04:38.950> this<00:04:39.190> and<00:04:39.820> it<00:04:39.940> doesn't

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:40.150 
mean whoever made this and it doesn't

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:41.970 
mean whoever made this and it doesn't
make<00:04:40.390> any<00:04:40.570> sense<00:04:40.900> because<00:04:41.260> why<00:04:41.650> would<00:04:41.860> they

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:41.980 
make any sense because why would they

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:44.250 
make any sense because why would they
put<00:04:42.190> all<00:04:42.400> this<00:04:42.610> effort<00:04:42.820> into<00:04:43.180> making<00:04:44.020> a

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:44.260 
put all this effort into making a

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.530 
put all this effort into making a
knockoff<00:04:44.650> Jersey<00:04:45.160> it<00:04:45.520> doesn't<00:04:46.270> make<00:04:46.390> any

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:46.540 
knockoff Jersey it doesn't make any

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:49.250 
knockoff Jersey it doesn't make any
sense<00:04:46.710> because<00:04:47.710> you<00:04:48.040> know<00:04:48.070> especially<00:04:48.280> with
