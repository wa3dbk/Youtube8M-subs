seven<00:00:49.170> months<00:00:49.379> ago<00:00:49.590> maybe<00:00:49.920> and<00:00:50.610> now<00:00:50.910> in<00:00:51.120> the

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
seven months ago maybe and now in the

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.819 
seven months ago maybe and now in the
new<00:00:51.390> polyp<00:00:51.780> since<00:00:52.020> I<00:00:52.110> got<00:00:52.230> these<00:00:52.379> lights<00:00:52.620> I'm

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
new polyp since I got these lights I'm

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.389 
new polyp since I got these lights I'm
noticing<00:00:53.100> green<00:00:53.670> orange<00:00:54.480> yellow<00:00:55.160> even<00:00:56.160> a

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
noticing green orange yellow even a

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.630 
noticing green orange yellow even a
little<00:00:56.610> red<00:00:56.879> maybe<00:00:57.500> so<00:00:58.520> they'll<00:00:59.520> be

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
little red maybe so they'll be

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:00.860 
little red maybe so they'll be
interesting<00:00:59.940> to<00:01:00.000> see<00:01:00.149> what<00:01:00.270> that<00:01:00.300> grows<00:01:00.660> out

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
interesting to see what that grows out

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:08.480 
interesting to see what that grows out
to<00:01:03.830> but<00:01:04.830> basically<00:01:05.400> I'm<00:01:06.000> seeing<00:01:07.340> coloring<00:01:08.340> up

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
to but basically I'm seeing coloring up

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.200 
to but basically I'm seeing coloring up
better<00:01:08.729> than<00:01:08.790> I've<00:01:09.060> had<00:01:09.270> with<00:01:09.540> my<00:01:09.780> other<00:01:10.110> stuff

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210 
better than I've had with my other stuff

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:14.750 
better than I've had with my other stuff
growth<00:01:12.210> is<00:01:12.479> great<00:01:12.979> polyp<00:01:13.979> extension<00:01:14.460> on<00:01:14.580> this

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
growth is great polyp extension on this

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.310 
growth is great polyp extension on this
on<00:01:15.060> this<00:01:15.299> meteor<00:01:15.630> shower<00:01:15.869> I've<00:01:16.020> had<00:01:16.170> this

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.410 
on this meteor shower I've had this
piece<00:01:16.560> for<00:01:16.710> maybe<00:01:16.890> eight<00:01:17.100> months<00:01:17.310> it's<00:01:17.909> never

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
piece for maybe eight months it's never

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.280 
piece for maybe eight months it's never
had<00:01:18.630> polyp<00:01:18.930> extension<00:01:19.409> like<00:01:19.560> this

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:23.290 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:26.550 

I<00:01:23.380> mean<00:01:24.010> that's

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:26.560 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.600 

that's<00:01:27.130> pretty<00:01:27.369> good<00:01:27.549> if<00:01:27.729> you<00:01:27.760> ask<00:01:27.850> me<00:01:29.610> other

that's pretty good if you ask me other

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:33.800 
that's pretty good if you ask me other
than<00:01:30.670> that<00:01:30.760> softies<00:01:31.420> love<00:01:31.659> it

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
than that softies love it

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.719 
than that softies love it
SPS<00:01:34.810> seems<00:01:35.080> to<00:01:35.200> love<00:01:35.380> it<00:01:35.590> I<00:01:35.770> haven't<00:01:36.460> burnt

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:36.729 
SPS seems to love it I haven't burnt

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:39.510 
SPS seems to love it I haven't burnt
anything<00:01:37.920> with<00:01:38.920> these<00:01:39.100> lights

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:39.520 
anything with these lights

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.340 
anything with these lights
I<00:01:39.640> don't<00:01:40.450> crack<00:01:40.690> them<00:01:40.840> up<00:01:40.960> to<00:01:41.080> a<00:01:41.140> hundred

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:41.350 
I don't crack them up to a hundred

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:43.550 
I don't crack them up to a hundred
percent<00:01:41.740> I<00:01:41.950> get<00:01:42.490> them<00:01:42.640> to<00:01:42.790> maybe<00:01:42.940> 80

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
percent I get them to maybe 80

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.190 
percent I get them to maybe 80
throughout<00:01:44.560> the<00:01:44.710> day<00:01:44.920> I<00:01:45.810> keep<00:01:46.810> them<00:01:46.930> in<00:01:47.050> the

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:47.200 
throughout the day I keep them in the

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.270 
throughout the day I keep them in the
probably<00:01:47.590> 20<00:01:47.950> to<00:01:48.100> 15k<00:01:48.850> range<00:01:49.210> at<00:01:49.780> least<00:01:50.110> 15k<00:01:51.009> I

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:51.280 
probably 20 to 15k range at least 15k I

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.300 
probably 20 to 15k range at least 15k I
like<00:01:51.820> a<00:01:51.850> little<00:01:52.299> bluer<00:01:52.540> spectrum<00:01:53.380> it's

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:54.310 
like a little bluer spectrum it's

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:56.310 
like a little bluer spectrum it's
probably<00:01:54.640> a<00:01:54.700> little<00:01:54.970> bluer<00:01:55.210> in<00:01:55.479> person<00:01:56.170> than

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:56.320 
probably a little bluer in person than

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:56.789 
probably a little bluer in person than
it<00:01:56.409> looks

00:01:56.789 --> 00:01:56.799 
it looks

00:01:56.799 --> 00:01:59.820 
it looks
through<00:01:57.190> the<00:01:57.280> camera<00:01:57.460> right<00:01:57.850> now<00:01:58.000> but<00:01:58.830> other

00:01:59.820 --> 00:01:59.830 
through the camera right now but other

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:01.889 
through the camera right now but other
than<00:02:00.009> that<00:02:00.100> I<00:02:00.399> I<00:02:00.759> got<00:02:01.509> nothing<00:02:01.750> but<00:02:01.840> good

00:02:01.889 --> 00:02:01.899 
than that I I got nothing but good

things<00:02:02.259> to<00:02:02.350> say<00:02:02.440> about<00:02:02.619> these<00:02:02.979> lights<00:02:03.300> so<00:02:04.300> if

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:04.600 
things to say about these lights so if

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.060 
things to say about these lights so if
any<00:02:04.750> of<00:02:04.810> you<00:02:04.869> guys<00:02:05.050> are<00:02:05.289> questioning<00:02:05.800> getting

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:06.070 
any of you guys are questioning getting

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:07.800 
any of you guys are questioning getting
them<00:02:06.159> there<00:02:06.369> they're<00:02:06.880> worth<00:02:07.060> the<00:02:07.270> money<00:02:07.479> it's

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 
them there they're worth the money it's

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:12.509 
them there they're worth the money it's
it's<00:02:08.530> a<00:02:08.619> big<00:02:08.830> bullet<00:02:09.190> to<00:02:09.310> bite<00:02:09.519> but<00:02:09.850> I<00:02:11.519> think

00:02:12.509 --> 00:02:12.519 
it's a big bullet to bite but I think

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:14.400 
it's a big bullet to bite but I think
with<00:02:12.670> the<00:02:12.819> longevity<00:02:13.510> and<00:02:13.690> the<00:02:13.720> warranty<00:02:14.230> and

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410 
with the longevity and the warranty and

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:15.840 
with the longevity and the warranty and
everything<00:02:14.590> else<00:02:15.040> they<00:02:15.220> got<00:02:15.370> going<00:02:15.700> there

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:15.850 
everything else they got going there

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:17.070 
everything else they got going there
they're<00:02:16.330> really<00:02:16.360> starting<00:02:16.750> to<00:02:16.959> gain

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
they're really starting to gain

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:22.350 
they're really starting to gain
popularity<00:02:17.590> no<00:02:17.980> so<00:02:19.920> my<00:02:20.920> guess<00:02:21.160> would<00:02:21.910> be<00:02:21.970> that

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
popularity no so my guess would be that

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.120 
popularity no so my guess would be that
they're<00:02:22.900> going<00:02:23.019> to<00:02:23.110> come<00:02:23.290> out<00:02:23.440> with<00:02:23.680> well<00:02:24.100> I

they're going to come out with well I

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:25.170

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
know they're going to come out with a

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.540 
know they're going to come out with a
fixture<00:02:25.650> so<00:02:26.650> if<00:02:26.890> you<00:02:26.980> don't<00:02:27.220> want<00:02:27.400> the
