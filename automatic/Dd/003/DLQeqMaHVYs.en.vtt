I<00:00:17.610> think<00:00:18.090> the<00:00:18.150> astronauts<00:00:18.480> might<00:00:18.660> want<00:00:18.810> to<00:00:18.869> see

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
I think the astronauts might want to see

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.810 
I think the astronauts might want to see
where<00:00:19.050> they're<00:00:19.140> going

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:30.180 
course they did otherwise it wouldn't be

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:40.240 
course they did otherwise it wouldn't be
able<00:00:30.240> to<00:00:30.360> see<00:00:30.570> from<00:00:30.720> their<00:00:30.869> seats

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:40.250 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:46.369 

what<00:00:41.540> what<00:00:42.540> do<00:00:42.600> they<00:00:42.690> don't<00:00:42.870> need<00:00:42.989> seats<00:00:45.379> they

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
have to have seats John why they can fly

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.040 
have to have seats John why they can fly
standing<00:00:49.800> up<00:00:49.920> yes<00:00:50.550> but<00:00:50.850> they<00:00:50.970> have<00:00:51.000> to<00:00:51.300> land<00:00:51.510> in

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
standing up yes but they have to land in

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.470 
standing up yes but they have to land in
one-sixth<00:00:52.650> gravity<00:00:52.940> that<00:00:53.940> legs<00:00:54.150> are<00:00:54.300> great

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
one-sixth gravity that legs are great

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.280 
one-sixth gravity that legs are great
shock<00:00:54.720> absorbers<00:00:56.809> if<00:00:57.809> they<00:00:57.960> were<00:00:58.019> standing

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:58.290 
shock absorbers if they were standing

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:00.320 
shock absorbers if they were standing
they'd<00:00:59.280> be<00:00:59.339> a<00:00:59.460> lot<00:00:59.640> closer<00:00:59.820> to<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.089> window

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:00.330 
they'd be a lot closer to the window

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:02.180 
they'd be a lot closer to the window
which<00:01:01.050> would<00:01:01.230> increase<00:01:01.500> their<00:01:01.680> field<00:01:01.920> of<00:01:02.100> view

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
which would increase their field of view

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.350 
which would increase their field of view
which<00:01:02.370> would<00:01:02.519> mean<00:01:02.640> we<00:01:02.790> wouldn't<00:01:03.030> need<00:01:03.120> such

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:03.360 
which would mean we wouldn't need such

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.560 
which would mean we wouldn't need such
big<00:01:03.390> windows<00:01:03.870> in<00:01:04.019> the<00:01:04.080> first<00:01:04.259> place<00:01:05.509> what<00:01:06.509> do

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
big windows in the first place what do

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.570 
big windows in the first place what do
you<00:01:06.630> think<00:01:07.009> well<00:01:08.009> I<00:01:08.070> think<00:01:08.100> it's<00:01:08.430> interesting

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
you think well I think it's interesting

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.120 
you think well I think it's interesting
