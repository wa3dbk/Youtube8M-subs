00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.070 
of the other hairs we have like

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:49.640 
of the other hairs we have like
synthetic<00:01:47.070> or<00:01:48.080> here<00:01:49.080> is<00:01:49.260> you<00:01:49.440> can<00:01:49.620> see

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:49.650 
synthetic or here is you can see

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:52.430 
synthetic or here is you can see
squirrel<00:01:50.340> hair<00:01:50.750> another<00:01:51.750> interesting

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:52.440 
squirrel hair another interesting

squirrel hair another interesting
feature<00:01:52.650> here<00:01:53.220> is<00:01:53.460> that<00:01:55.040> the<00:01:56.040> tip<00:01:56.280> of<00:01:56.520> of<00:01:56.970> the

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
feature here is that the tip of of the

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:02.090 
feature here is that the tip of of the
hog<00:01:57.450> Bristol<00:01:57.960> hair<00:01:58.260> is<00:01:59.220> flagged<00:01:59.790> or<00:02:00.830> split<00:02:01.830> in

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
hog Bristol hair is flagged or split in

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.800 
hog Bristol hair is flagged or split in
two<00:02:02.310> parts<00:02:02.960> so<00:02:03.960> this<00:02:04.200> flex<00:02:04.590> are<00:02:05.450> what<00:02:06.450> makes

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
two parts so this flex are what makes

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.759 
two parts so this flex are what makes
hog<00:02:07.290> Bristol<00:02:07.890> hair<00:02:08.690> very<00:02:09.690> nice<00:02:10.019> for

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:10.769 
hog Bristol hair very nice for

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:16.380 
hog Bristol hair very nice for
distributing<00:02:11.519> paint

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:19.870 

okay<00:02:17.390> let<00:02:17.660> us<00:02:17.690> first<00:02:18.200> measure<00:02:18.650> the<00:02:19.010> diameter

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
okay let us first measure the diameter

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.920 
okay let us first measure the diameter
of<00:02:20.090> the<00:02:20.870> kolinsky<00:02:21.410> sable<00:02:21.860> hair<00:02:22.240> so<00:02:23.240> here<00:02:23.570> just

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
of the kolinsky sable hair so here just

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.500 
of the kolinsky sable hair so here just
I<00:02:24.410> just<00:02:25.340> put<00:02:25.580> this<00:02:25.730> picture<00:02:26.000> for<00:02:26.390> you

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
I just put this picture for you

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:27.280 
I just put this picture for you
information

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
information

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.670 
information
it's<00:02:27.640> the<00:02:28.640> birth<00:02:28.850> of<00:02:29.150> the<00:02:29.720> kolinsky<00:02:30.260> sable

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
it's the birth of the kolinsky sable

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.610 
it's the birth of the kolinsky sable
hair<00:02:30.920> and<00:02:31.370> now<00:02:32.030> now<00:02:32.450> let's<00:02:32.750> go<00:02:33.230> to<00:02:33.290> the

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
hair and now now let's go to the

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:38.530 
hair and now now let's go to the
measurements<00:02:34.900> so<00:02:35.900> first<00:02:36.700> here<00:02:37.700> we<00:02:38.000> we

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
measurements so first here we we

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.940 
measurements so first here we we
measured<00:02:39.020> on<00:02:39.730> the<00:02:40.730> diameter<00:02:41.300> of<00:02:41.630> the<00:02:42.380> kolinsky

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
measured on the diameter of the kolinsky

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:47.350 
measured on the diameter of the kolinsky
fire<00:02:43.220> at<00:02:44.050> 1<00:02:45.050> centimeter<00:02:45.770> from<00:02:46.490> the<00:02:46.610> tip<00:02:46.820> of<00:02:47.180> the

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
fire at 1 centimeter from the tip of the

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:52.080 
fire at 1 centimeter from the tip of the
hair<00:02:47.570> so<00:02:48.490> we<00:02:49.490> find<00:02:49.820> that<00:02:49.940> the<00:02:50.210> diameter<00:02:50.450> is

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
hair so we find that the diameter is

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:57.250 
hair so we find that the diameter is
about<00:02:53.200> 77<00:02:54.200> micrometers<00:02:55.160> so<00:02:55.610> now<00:02:56.450> let's<00:02:56.720> go<00:02:56.960> to

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 
about 77 micrometers so now let's go to

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:01.690 
about 77 micrometers so now let's go to
the<00:02:57.800> next<00:02:57.980> picture<00:02:59.770> here<00:03:00.770> we<00:03:01.010> measured<00:03:01.460> the

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 
the next picture here we measured the

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.750 
the next picture here we measured the
diameter<00:03:02.000> of<00:03:02.480> kolinsky<00:03:03.230> fire<00:03:03.500> at<00:03:03.860> 5

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:04.760 
diameter of kolinsky fire at 5

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:07.600 
diameter of kolinsky fire at 5
millimeters<00:03:05.630> from<00:03:06.110> the<00:03:06.380> tip<00:03:06.590> of<00:03:06.800> the<00:03:07.070> hair<00:03:07.310> and

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:07.610 
millimeters from the tip of the hair and

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:12.970 
millimeters from the tip of the hair and
it's<00:03:08.600> around<00:03:09.440> 50<00:03:10.090> micrometers<00:03:11.470> so<00:03:12.470> now<00:03:12.650> let's

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:12.980 
it's around 50 micrometers so now let's

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:18.060 
it's around 50 micrometers so now let's
go<00:03:13.250> to<00:03:13.280> the<00:03:13.670> clip<00:03:14.770> so<00:03:15.770> here<00:03:16.130> here<00:03:16.610> is<00:03:16.760> a<00:03:16.790> clip<00:03:17.120> of

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:18.070 
go to the clip so here here is a clip of

kolinsky sable hair let us zoom in again
and<00:03:24.200> here<00:03:24.590> you<00:03:25.130> I'm<00:03:25.730> not<00:03:26.000> sure<00:03:26.270> if<00:03:26.510> you<00:03:26.720> could

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:26.959 
and here you I'm not sure if you could

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:30.790 
and here you I'm not sure if you could
see<00:03:27.020> it<00:03:27.320> on<00:03:27.860> your<00:03:28.040> video<00:03:28.250> but<00:03:28.640> it's<00:03:29.620> here<00:03:30.620> we

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:30.800 
see it on your video but it's here we

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:34.949 
see it on your video but it's here we
measured<00:03:31.160> the<00:03:31.340> diameter<00:03:31.489> and<00:03:32.120> it's<00:03:32.770> about<00:03:33.770> 26

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:34.959 
measured the diameter and it's about 26

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:39.070 
measured the diameter and it's about 26
micrometers<00:03:35.959> and<00:03:36.550> we<00:03:37.550> did<00:03:37.790> the<00:03:38.540> measurement

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:39.080 
micrometers and we did the measurement

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:43.660

the<00:06:46.949> clip<00:06:47.479> and<00:06:48.860> here<00:06:49.860> if<00:06:50.580> you<00:06:50.820> look<00:06:51.000> at<00:06:51.180> this

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:51.360 
the clip and here if you look at this

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:55.420 
the clip and here if you look at this
picture<00:06:52.460> we<00:06:53.460> notice<00:06:53.880> a<00:06:54.180> couple<00:06:54.570> of<00:06:54.810> scenes

00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:55.430 
picture we notice a couple of scenes

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:58.370 
picture we notice a couple of scenes
well<00:06:56.430> first<00:06:56.760> of<00:06:56.940> all<00:06:57.120> as<00:06:57.389> the<00:06:57.419> diameter<00:06:57.810> is

00:06:58.370 --> 00:06:58.380 
well first of all as the diameter is

00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:01.580 
well first of all as the diameter is
quite<00:06:58.710> small<00:06:59.070> it<00:06:59.760> it<00:07:00.210> is<00:07:00.449> smaller<00:07:00.870> than<00:07:01.229> the

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:01.590 
quite small it it is smaller than the

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:05.439 
quite small it it is smaller than the
diameter<00:07:01.770> of<00:07:02.270> both<00:07:03.300> kolinsky<00:07:03.900> sable<00:07:04.680> and

00:07:05.439 --> 00:07:05.449 
diameter of both kolinsky sable and

00:07:05.449 --> 00:07:09.290 
diameter of both kolinsky sable and
siberian<00:07:06.449> squirrel<00:07:06.810> hair<00:07:07.229> and<00:07:08.120> we<00:07:09.120> also

00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:09.300 
siberian squirrel hair and we also

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:14.300 
siberian squirrel hair and we also
noticed<00:07:10.229> that<00:07:11.180> it's<00:07:12.180> not<00:07:12.510> straight<00:07:13.169> as<00:07:13.470> as<00:07:13.860> is

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:14.310 
noticed that it's not straight as as is

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:18.379 
noticed that it's not straight as as is
in<00:07:14.699> the<00:07:14.760> case<00:07:15.180> of<00:07:15.830> kolinsky<00:07:16.830> or<00:07:17.120> squirrel<00:07:18.120> hair

00:07:18.379 --> 00:07:18.389 
in the case of kolinsky or squirrel hair

00:07:18.389 --> 00:07:24.189 
in the case of kolinsky or squirrel hair
it<00:07:19.110> is<00:07:19.320> a<00:07:20.180> little<00:07:21.180> bit<00:07:21.360> bent<00:07:21.690> and<00:07:22.610> we<00:07:23.610> believe

00:07:24.189 --> 00:07:24.199 
it is a little bit bent and we believe

00:07:24.199 --> 00:07:28.040 
it is a little bit bent and we believe
this<00:07:25.280> the<00:07:26.280> fact<00:07:26.550> that<00:07:26.699> the<00:07:27.240> diameter<00:07:27.840> is<00:07:28.020> very

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:28.050 
this the fact that the diameter is very

00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:31.879 
this the fact that the diameter is very
small<00:07:28.729> is<00:07:29.729> the<00:07:30.389> reason<00:07:30.750> why<00:07:30.990> artists

00:07:31.879 --> 00:07:31.889 
small is the reason why artists

00:07:31.889 --> 00:07:35.529 
small is the reason why artists
sometimes<00:07:32.669> report<00:07:33.479> that<00:07:33.990> synthetic<00:07:34.949> brush

00:07:35.529 --> 00:07:35.539 
sometimes report that synthetic brush

00:07:35.539 --> 00:07:38.719 
sometimes report that synthetic brush

here<00:07:46.409> we<00:07:46.650> add<00:07:47.430> the<00:07:48.120> very<00:07:48.389> tip<00:07:48.719> and<00:07:48.960> we<00:07:49.349> measure

00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:50.420 
here we add the very tip and we measure

00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:55.000 
here we add the very tip and we measure
the<00:07:51.410> diameter<00:07:52.070> and<00:07:52.280> it's<00:07:53.500> around<00:07:54.500> four
