guys so you place an item in the hopper

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.340 
guys so you place an item in the hopper
it's<00:01:10.130> like<00:01:11.130> I'd<00:01:11.700> say<00:01:11.850> it's<00:01:11.970> quite<00:01:12.180> fast<00:01:12.420> and<00:01:12.659> it

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
it's like I'd say it's quite fast and it

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.780 
it's like I'd say it's quite fast and it
goes<00:01:13.560> into<00:01:14.390> that<00:01:15.390> so<00:01:16.200> in<00:01:16.979> order<00:01:17.369> to<00:01:17.549> place<00:01:17.759> a

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
goes into that so in order to place a

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.340 
goes into that so in order to place a
hopper<00:01:20.540> you're<00:01:21.540> we're<00:01:21.689> gonna<00:01:21.869> need<00:01:22.020> to<00:01:22.229> do

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
hopper you're we're gonna need to do

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.859 
hopper you're we're gonna need to do
this<00:01:22.530> you<00:01:22.830> need<00:01:23.040> to<00:01:23.100> press<00:01:23.369> shift<00:01:23.580> which<00:01:24.540> makes

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
this you need to press shift which makes

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.830 
this you need to press shift which makes
you<00:01:25.049> crouch<00:01:25.530> and<00:01:26.180> just<00:01:27.180> place<00:01:27.360> it<00:01:27.390> like<00:01:27.659> that

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
you crouch and just place it like that

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.410 
you crouch and just place it like that
you<00:01:28.619> can<00:01:28.650> also<00:01:28.860> place<00:01:29.189> it<00:01:29.340> to<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:29.460> side<00:01:29.549> either

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
you can also place it to the side either

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.929 
you can also place it to the side either
side<00:01:30.780> and<00:01:31.020> on<00:01:31.110> top<00:01:31.380> so<00:01:32.340> as<00:01:32.460> long<00:01:32.579> as<00:01:32.640> you<00:01:32.820> guys

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
side and on top so as long as you guys

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.789 
side and on top so as long as you guys
can<00:01:33.090> see<00:01:33.150> that<00:01:33.450> it's<00:01:33.600> connected<00:01:34.229> right<00:01:34.590> there

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
can see that it's connected right there

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.539 
can see that it's connected right there
like<00:01:35.549> that<00:01:35.759> I<00:01:36.060> don't<00:01:36.810> is<00:01:37.110> it<00:01:37.710> connected<00:01:38.250> to<00:01:38.310> the

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
like that I don't is it connected to the

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.240 
like that I don't is it connected to the
chest<00:01:39.060> I<00:01:39.210> don't<00:01:39.390> I<00:01:39.630> don't<00:01:39.810> really<00:01:40.079> know<00:01:40.250> but

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
chest I don't I don't really know but

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.330 
chest I don't I don't really know but
anyways<00:01:42.210> it<00:01:42.630> actually<00:01:43.290> it<00:01:43.409> is<00:01:43.560> connected<00:01:44.009> just

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
anyways it actually it is connected just

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.310 
anyways it actually it is connected just
like<00:01:44.520> that<00:01:44.729> so<00:01:44.970> that'll<00:01:45.240> leave<00:01:45.420> and<00:01:45.840> that'll

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
like that so that'll leave and that'll

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.840 
like that so that'll leave and that'll
go<00:01:46.470> into<00:01:46.950> there<00:01:48.079> so<00:01:49.079> this<00:01:49.560> works<00:01:49.860> the<00:01:50.430> same<00:01:50.640> way

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
go into there so this works the same way

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.460 
go into there so this works the same way
except<00:01:51.180> it's<00:01:51.329> kind<00:01:51.509> of<00:01:51.630> kind<00:01:52.110> of<00:01:52.200> a<00:01:52.259> letdown

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
except it's kind of kind of a letdown

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.270 
except it's kind of kind of a letdown
because<00:01:53.340> instead<00:01:54.060> of<00:01:54.799> putting<00:01:55.799> these<00:01:55.979> it

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
because instead of putting these it

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.219 
because instead of putting these it
won't<00:01:56.520> go<00:01:56.670> to<00:01:56.700> the<00:01:56.939> fuel<00:01:57.299> section<00:01:57.780> it'll<00:01:58.049> just

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
won't go to the fuel section it'll just

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:02.060 
won't go to the fuel section it'll just
go<00:01:58.380> to<00:01:58.740> the<00:01:58.829> item<00:01:58.979> section<00:01:59.969> which<00:02:01.009> kind<00:02:02.009> of

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
go to the item section which kind of

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.740 
go to the item section which kind of
sucks<00:02:02.340> because<00:02:02.520> if<00:02:02.820> you<00:02:02.880> ever<00:02:02.969> had<00:02:03.210> coal<00:02:03.479> and

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
sucks because if you ever had coal and

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.420 
sucks because if you ever had coal and
you<00:02:03.810> wanted<00:02:04.020> to<00:02:04.049> transport<00:02:04.590> it<00:02:04.710> you'd<00:02:05.159> have<00:02:05.310> to

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
you wanted to transport it you'd have to

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:10.699 
you wanted to transport it you'd have to
do<00:02:05.549> that<00:02:05.579> by<00:02:06.119> yourself<00:02:06.240> and<00:02:08.690> for<00:02:09.690> this<00:02:10.349> all

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
do that by yourself and for this all

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.380 
do that by yourself and for this all
pretty<00:02:11.190> much<00:02:11.310> the<00:02:11.459> exact<00:02:11.730> same<00:02:11.760> as<00:02:12.030> the<00:02:12.180> chest

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
pretty much the exact same as the chest

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
pretty much the exact same as the chest
it'll<00:02:12.690> just

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
it'll just

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.890 
it'll just
keep<00:02:13.590> going<00:02:13.890> in<00:02:14.310> so<00:02:14.820> we'll<00:02:15.270> just<00:02:15.480> grab<00:02:15.600> these

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
keep going in so we'll just grab these

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:21.170 
keep going in so we'll just grab these
and<00:02:16.680> grab<00:02:17.460> that<00:02:18.590> so<00:02:19.590> now<00:02:19.740> right<00:02:20.190> here<00:02:20.520> I<00:02:20.700> want

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
and grab that so now right here I want

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:22.970 
and grab that so now right here I want

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
diamonds and well let's say you put a

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.020 
diamonds and well let's say you put a
hopper<00:03:03.150> on<00:03:03.330> every<00:03:03.780> block<00:03:04.050> you<00:03:04.320> went<00:03:04.560> past

eventually oh oh right okay so I didn't
connect<00:03:26.930> the<00:03:27.930> hopper<00:03:28.230> to<00:03:28.350> the<00:03:28.440> chest<00:03:28.740> what

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
connect the hopper to the chest what

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:31.250 
connect the hopper to the chest what
they<00:03:29.040> do<00:03:29.100> end<00:03:29.370> up<00:03:29.520> here<00:03:29.820> so<00:03:30.420> I<00:03:30.450> will<00:03:30.690> just<00:03:30.900> show

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
they do so yeah guys that is how you use

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.540 
they do so yeah guys that is how you use
a<00:03:48.180> hopper<00:03:48.930> that<00:03:49.230> gives<00:03:49.440> a<00:03:49.590> basic<00:03:49.770> definition

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:50.550 
a hopper that gives a basic definition

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:53.870 
a hopper that gives a basic definition
of<00:03:50.610> what<00:03:50.760> a<00:03:50.790> hopper<00:03:51.120> does<00:03:52.310> just<00:03:53.310> there's<00:03:53.580> a<00:03:53.670> lot

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:53.880 
of what a hopper does just there's a lot

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:57.410 
of what a hopper does just there's a lot
more<00:03:54.420> things<00:03:54.750> a<00:03:54.900> hopper<00:03:55.230> can<00:03:55.380> do<00:03:55.670> I'm<00:03:56.670> guessing

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:57.420 
more things a hopper can do I'm guessing

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:59.810 
more things a hopper can do I'm guessing
because<00:03:57.840> I<00:03:58.080> this<00:03:58.410> is<00:03:58.560> only<00:03:58.800> really<00:03:59.130> the<00:03:59.610> things

00:03:59.810 --> 00:03:59.820 
because I this is only really the things

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:02.660 
because I this is only really the things
I've<00:03:59.970> done<00:04:00.000> with<00:04:00.330> it<00:04:00.650> but<00:04:01.650> if<00:04:02.130> this<00:04:02.400> helped<00:04:02.640> you
