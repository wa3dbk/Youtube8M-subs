00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 well yes there many times reading I will tell you 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:08.030
 in Russian translation compared to 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:13.019
 Slavic translation Slavic made 

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:17.070
 translation from the Greek text from that 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:20.970
 Greek text which is 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:26.330
 translation from the Hebrew text done 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:29.550
 for more than 200 years, even the power of Christ 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:31.679
 this is a Greek translation of this 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.500
 Greek translation made our 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:38.129
 Slavic translation of the Bible into Russian 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:40.680
 the translation is made mostly true not 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:43.140
 quite but mostly with so called 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:46.140
 Masoretic text that is Jewish 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.570
 the text we were from was very simple 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.420
 that after all is one thing and the script 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.820
 another thing translation and translation from translation 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:57.600
 imagine what could be there 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:01:00.480
 but at the same time in the church constantly 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:03.180
 persistently present thought that 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.979
 I also expressed the philosopher, then I donâ€™t 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.200
 but the mouth has confirmed it 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.280
 that we are Soviet here this 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.720
 Hebrew text 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:15.210
 it was not the original text and 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:17.070
 damaged in anything about this in this 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.250
 evidence is very certain that in 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:23.880
 hundredth year of our era hundredth first century 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:27.680
 so here that all were collected 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:31.670
 synagogue bible list 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:35.430
 Old Testament were assembled and replaced 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:38.759
 new lists and the old ones were all 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.759
 It destroyed it was done just here 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:44.850
 this year that is in the era 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:48.930
 the strongest heat struggle with the advent 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:51.869
 Christianity and that has been going since then 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.750
 if you want this is now well argue that there 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:57.420
 nineteen centuries what to give 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:02:01.969
 preference for this new masoretic 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:06.350
 text or greek translation 70 and 

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:11.150
 only thanks to Qumran discoveries 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:13.230
 1900 nine hundred and forty-eight 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:17.659
 subsequent translation of the find 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:23.750
 it was lived that the Masoretic text is true 

00:02:17.659 --> 00:02:28.290
 proved to be immeasurably more damaged 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:30.739
 distorted even than the translation itself 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:33.120
 seventy 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:35.700
 thanks to these Qumran finds 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.160
 only able to match because 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.810
 found manuscripts 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:42.120
 pre-christian era second third 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:45.660
 centuries and could match them with 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:48.269
 the masoretic translation and even amusin 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:50.549
 our largest researcher is up 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:54.739
 manuscripts still Soviet researcher 

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:57.359
 by the way he is a Jew here he writes 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:59.700
 countless corrections that 

00:02:57.359 --> 00:03:02.629
 required to do in masoretskom 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:06.359
 Hebrew text of the post I'm not here 

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:08.180
 the original and in the septuagint much 

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:11.670
 less damage 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:14.359
 so that the Slavic text is necessary 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:18.959
 say that much more correct 

00:03:14.359 --> 00:03:21.480
 much more true this text here but 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:26.099
 that not everyone can read of course 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:29.239
 Slavic text I will tell you so for 

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:32.910
 we have something greater new testament 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:34.400
 from the old covenant and the old covenant 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:37.139
 of course psalms 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:38.700
 Slavic and Slavic read if 

00:03:37.139 --> 00:03:40.859
 anyone for solyansky 1 need 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:43.340
 Parallel straight look so as not to 

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:46.819
 to be mistaken in some things 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:50.639
 by the way one place is special there 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:51.269
 striking was one place of 

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:56.280
 psalm 

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:59.810
 where wash your 21 psalm cards where by 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:03.569
 masoretic text in solva 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:11.419
 talks about christ about the future mission 

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:14.459
 deliverers like a lion as a lion, as it is written 

00:04:11.419 --> 00:04:16.829
 all plug-ty in the Greek translation 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:19.829
 written and in the Slavic text us 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:24.210
 written pierced my hands 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:25.050
 and my legs that is a direct indication of 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:29.849
 suffering 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:31.530
 missions you hear and there by means of here 

00:04:29.849 --> 00:04:36.000
 of these trimmer marks and on 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:38.610
 urgent transferred as a mission lion will 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.409
 like a lion represent and suddenly 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:44.849
 pierced my hands 

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:47.900
 and my legs are amazing for you 

00:04:44.849 --> 00:04:51.090
 it is the strongest place 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:54.479
 like that so of course of course who 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:58.580
 can then relate to the Slavic 

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:58.580
 text it is more accurate
