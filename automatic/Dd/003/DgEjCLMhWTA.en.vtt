00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:12.869 
it was a megatron going after the cube
or<00:02:09.149> the<00:02:10.149> Fallen<00:02:10.629> coming<00:02:11.050> down<00:02:11.290> and<00:02:11.879> building

00:02:12.869 --> 00:02:12.879 
or the Fallen coming down and building

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:14.820 
or the Fallen coming down and building
pyramids<00:02:13.150> or<00:02:13.510> whatever<00:02:13.750> or<00:02:14.140> not<00:02:14.409> to<00:02:14.500> fall<00:02:14.680> on

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
pyramids or whatever or not to fall on

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:17.880 
pyramids or whatever or not to fall on
but<00:02:15.040> the<00:02:15.760> the<00:02:16.720> primes<00:02:17.050> and<00:02:17.349> then<00:02:17.500> the<00:02:17.590> Fallen

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
but the the primes and then the Fallen

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:19.800 
but the the primes and then the Fallen
being<00:02:18.040> part<00:02:18.250> of<00:02:18.310> the<00:02:18.400> parts<00:02:18.640> at<00:02:18.730> the<00:02:18.819> time<00:02:19.000> so

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
being part of the parts at the time so

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:21.300 
being part of the parts at the time so
in<00:02:19.930> this<00:02:20.080> one<00:02:20.349> it<00:02:20.470> seems<00:02:20.709> like<00:02:20.950> there's<00:02:21.159> going

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
in this one it seems like there's going

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:23.130 
in this one it seems like there's going
to<00:02:21.459> be<00:02:21.519> transformer<00:02:22.330> ships<00:02:22.569> arriving<00:02:22.900> at

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
to be transformer ships arriving at

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.250 
to be transformer ships arriving at
Earth<00:02:23.290> during<00:02:23.560> prehistoric<00:02:23.890> times<00:02:24.670> and

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
Earth during prehistoric times and

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.320 
Earth during prehistoric times and
that's<00:02:26.260> I<00:02:26.680> think<00:02:26.769> probably<00:02:27.700> he's<00:02:28.090> going<00:02:28.239> to

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
that's I think probably he's going to

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:29.819 
that's I think probably he's going to
set<00:02:28.480> the<00:02:28.599> tone<00:02:28.780> for<00:02:28.810> the<00:02:29.080> Dinobots<00:02:29.530> and<00:02:29.739> how

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:29.829 
set the tone for the Dinobots and how

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:31.920 
set the tone for the Dinobots and how
they<00:02:29.980> came<00:02:30.159> to<00:02:30.219> be<00:02:30.400> because<00:02:31.180> as<00:02:31.510> you<00:02:31.629> know<00:02:31.659> when

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
they came to be because as you know when

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:33.330 
they came to be because as you know when
the<00:02:32.019> Transformers<00:02:32.530> arrived<00:02:32.739> to<00:02:32.859> earth<00:02:33.010> they

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
the Transformers arrived to earth they

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:34.250 
the Transformers arrived to earth they
scan

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
scan

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.820 
scan
whatever<00:02:34.439> they<00:02:34.650> want<00:02:34.890> to<00:02:35.360> you<00:02:36.360> know<00:02:36.530> look<00:02:37.530> like

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
whatever they want to you know look like

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:40.610 
whatever they want to you know look like
or<00:02:38.299> stuff<00:02:39.299> like<00:02:39.420> that<00:02:39.480> I've<00:02:40.079> never<00:02:40.260> seen<00:02:40.379> them

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
or stuff like that I've never seen them

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.110 
or stuff like that I've never seen them
do<00:02:40.769> anything<00:02:41.129> or<00:02:41.280> organic<00:02:41.730> with<00:02:42.030> the

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
do anything or organic with the

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.179 
do anything or organic with the
exception<00:02:42.510> of<00:02:42.569> the<00:02:42.720> one<00:02:42.750> that<00:02:43.110> was<00:02:43.230> in<00:02:43.439> revenge

00:02:44.179 --> 00:02:44.189 
exception of the one that was in revenge

00:02:44.189 --> 00:02:45.679 
exception of the one that was in revenge
of<00:02:44.280> the<00:02:44.340> Fallen<00:02:44.760> the<00:02:44.909> chick<00:02:45.180> in<00:02:45.329> the<00:02:45.390> beginning

00:02:45.679 --> 00:02:45.689 
of the Fallen the chick in the beginning

00:02:45.689 --> 00:02:48.410 
of the Fallen the chick in the beginning
of<00:02:45.750> the<00:02:45.840> movie<00:02:46.110> so<00:02:46.860> looks<00:02:47.159> like<00:02:47.280> that's<00:02:48.060> how

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
of the movie so looks like that's how

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:49.819 
of the movie so looks like that's how
the<00:02:48.480> Dinobots<00:02:49.019> come<00:02:49.260> now<00:02:49.439> that's<00:02:49.739> the

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:49.829 
the Dinobots come now that's the

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:51.530 
the Dinobots come now that's the
speculation<00:02:50.519> the<00:02:50.610> guy<00:02:50.700> didn't<00:02:50.940> even<00:02:50.970> say<00:02:51.299> that

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
speculation the guy didn't even say that

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.259 
speculation the guy didn't even say that
but<00:02:52.230> he<00:02:52.349> did<00:02:52.590> say<00:02:52.860> that<00:02:53.280> a<00:02:53.310> series<00:02:53.879> of<00:02:53.909> ships

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:54.269 
but he did say that a series of ships

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:55.970 
but he did say that a series of ships
come<00:02:54.629> to<00:02:54.780> earth<00:02:54.930> during<00:02:55.140> prehistoric<00:02:55.440> times

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
come to earth during prehistoric times

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.670 
come to earth during prehistoric times
so<00:02:56.909> that's<00:02:57.329> my<00:02:57.690> guess<00:02:57.750> is<00:02:57.959> that<00:02:58.230> that's<00:02:58.500> how

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
so that's my guess is that that's how

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.190 
so that's my guess is that that's how
the<00:02:58.739> Dinobots<00:02:59.190> are<00:02:59.340> born<00:02:59.610> they<00:02:59.879> get<00:03:00.480> there<00:03:00.720> in

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
the Dinobots are born they get there in

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.589 
the Dinobots are born they get there in
their<00:03:01.849> Cybertronian<00:03:02.849> form<00:03:03.120> and<00:03:03.390> then<00:03:03.450> they

00:03:03.589 --> 00:03:03.599 
their Cybertronian form and then they

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:08.449 
their Cybertronian form and then they
scan<00:03:04.049> and<00:03:04.500> become<00:03:05.280> the<00:03:05.310> dinobots<00:03:05.939> now<00:03:07.459> another

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459 
scan and become the dinobots now another

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:09.830 
scan and become the dinobots now another
thing<00:03:08.579> they<00:03:08.790> said<00:03:09.030> is<00:03:09.060> if<00:03:09.420> you<00:03:09.510> remember<00:03:09.750> the

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
thing they said is if you remember the

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.449 
thing they said is if you remember the
trailer<00:03:10.170> that<00:03:10.319> ship<00:03:10.590> flying<00:03:10.859> overhead<00:03:11.190> that

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
trailer that ship flying overhead that

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:13.399 
trailer that ship flying overhead that
seems<00:03:11.670> to<00:03:11.790> be<00:03:11.879> sucking<00:03:12.239> stuff<00:03:12.480> up<00:03:12.659> well<00:03:13.200> that's

00:03:13.399 --> 00:03:13.409 
seems to be sucking stuff up well that's

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:15.860 
seems to be sucking stuff up well that's
lockdown<00:03:14.099> ship<00:03:14.489> and<00:03:14.730> it's<00:03:15.090> got<00:03:15.239> a<00:03:15.269> magnetism

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
lockdown ship and it's got a magnetism

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:17.890 
lockdown ship and it's got a magnetism
about<00:03:16.290> it<00:03:16.470> and<00:03:16.620> that's<00:03:16.769> how<00:03:16.980> he<00:03:17.010> captures

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:17.900 
about it and that's how he captures

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:20.059 
about it and that's how he captures
robots<00:03:18.900> because<00:03:19.260> apparently<00:03:19.650> he's<00:03:19.859> like<00:03:20.040> a

00:03:20.059 --> 00:03:20.069 
robots because apparently he's like a

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:22.339 
robots because apparently he's like a
like<00:03:20.700> a<00:03:20.730> junk<00:03:21.120> collector<00:03:21.269> it<00:03:21.750> collected<00:03:22.079> junk

00:03:22.339 --> 00:03:22.349 
like a junk collector it collected junk

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:24.319 
like a junk collector it collected junk
and<00:03:22.530> robot<00:03:23.400> parts<00:03:23.730> and<00:03:23.849> stuff<00:03:23.909> whatever<00:03:24.150> I

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:24.329 
and robot parts and stuff whatever I

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:26.629 
and robot parts and stuff whatever I
guess<00:03:24.569> to<00:03:24.720> maybe<00:03:24.900> enhance<00:03:25.230> himself<00:03:25.680> and<00:03:25.920> they

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:26.639 
guess to maybe enhance himself and they

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:28.580 
guess to maybe enhance himself and they
talk<00:03:26.879> about<00:03:26.909> him<00:03:27.329> kidnapping<00:03:27.780> optimist<00:03:28.319> so

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
talk about him kidnapping optimist so

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:30.349 
talk about him kidnapping optimist so
you<00:03:29.250> know<00:03:29.370> we'll<00:03:29.579> see<00:03:29.609> what<00:03:29.730> happens<00:03:30.030> with

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:30.359 
you know we'll see what happens with

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:33.020 
you know we'll see what happens with
that<00:03:30.470> he<00:03:31.470> did<00:03:31.739> confirm<00:03:32.220> that<00:03:32.250> Galvatron

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
that he did confirm that Galvatron

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:36.009 
that he did confirm that Galvatron
obviously<00:03:33.450> is<00:03:33.569> man-made<00:03:34.190> human-controlled

00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:36.019 
obviously is man-made human-controlled

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:38.149 
obviously is man-made human-controlled
some<00:03:37.019> people<00:03:37.319> in<00:03:37.440> my<00:03:37.560> other<00:03:37.709> video<00:03:37.829> that<00:03:38.129> I

00:03:38.149 --> 00:03:38.159 
some people in my other video that I

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:40.580 
some people in my other video that I
posted<00:03:38.220> the<00:03:38.669> other<00:03:38.699> day<00:03:39.379> mentioned<00:03:40.379> that

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
posted the other day mentioned that

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:42.500 
posted the other day mentioned that
maybe<00:03:40.829> Galvatron<00:03:41.459> will<00:03:41.609> end<00:03:41.849> up<00:03:42.000> going<00:03:42.030> rogue

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
maybe Galvatron will end up going rogue

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:44.629 
maybe Galvatron will end up going rogue
and<00:03:43.379> I<00:03:43.470> see<00:03:43.680> I<00:03:43.829> see<00:03:43.889> that<00:03:44.280> as<00:03:44.310> a<00:03:44.400> possibility

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:44.639 
and I see I see that as a possibility

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:47.089 
and I see I see that as a possibility
and<00:03:45.299> I<00:03:46.139> don't<00:03:46.410> know<00:03:46.500> if<00:03:46.590> that<00:03:46.709> will<00:03:46.799> alleviate

00:03:47.089 --> 00:03:47.099 
and I don't know if that will alleviate

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:49.339 
and I don't know if that will alleviate
the<00:03:47.489> pain<00:03:47.730> that<00:03:48.000> he's<00:03:48.239> even<00:03:48.269> created<00:03:49.019> by<00:03:49.109> man

00:03:49.339 --> 00:03:49.349 
the pain that he's even created by man

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:52.640 
the pain that he's even created by man
in<00:03:49.530> the<00:03:49.590> first<00:03:49.829> place<00:03:50.060> but<00:03:51.060> um<00:03:51.379> we'll<00:03:52.379> see<00:03:52.410> how

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
in the first place but um we'll see how

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:55.189 
in the first place but um we'll see how
that<00:03:52.709> plays<00:03:52.949> out<00:03:53.280> so<00:03:54.030> very<00:03:54.540> interesting<00:03:54.750> you

00:03:55.189 --> 00:03:55.199

00:03:57.239 --> 00:03:59.720 
know and then they talk about Mark
Wahlberg's<00:03:57.690> role<00:03:58.049> and<00:03:58.560> how<00:03:58.799> he<00:03:59.220> finds

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730 
Wahlberg's role and how he finds

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:02.420 
Wahlberg's role and how he finds
optimist<00:04:00.720> and<00:04:01.079> how<00:04:01.199> the<00:04:01.260> government<00:04:01.650> I<00:04:02.099> guess

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
optimist and how the government I guess

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:05.449 
optimist and how the government I guess
has<00:04:02.639> a<00:04:02.669> way<00:04:03.000> of<00:04:03.030> tracking<00:04:04.250> transformers<00:04:05.250> when

they're known in particular I guess they

00:04:07.139 --> 00:04:08.420
