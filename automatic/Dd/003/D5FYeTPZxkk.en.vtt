00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.800

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:07.770
 hi i am anti welcome again 

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:10.020
 to my kitchen on February 14th I already know 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.910
 about the day of love and friendship and of 

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:13.230
 sure many of you are thinking 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.750
 in which they will give that person 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.119
 special or maybe they already have good 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.580
 I hide that gift waiting for the 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.770
 perfect time to give it 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:26.240
 and if that person has not arrived yet 

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:26.240
 special that you love so much 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:34.259
 we can also scream us in high s 

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:34.259
 especially and make us a very good test 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:41.090
 but this is not about me but about you 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:44.060
 so I'm going to teach you how to make a 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:45.860
 good breakfast and everyone knows them 

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:48.860
 famous for cakes 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:50.960
 here according to where the country where you live 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:53.989
 whatever it's called but let's do it from 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:56.059
 a funny pretty romantic way 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:58.760
 that you can present a good breakfast 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:01:02.210
 for that person that you want so much 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:04.940
 let's start for the mass of hot cakes 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:06.770
 you can already use the boxes that come 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:09.440
 recipe prepared with nothing else 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:11.060
 they add this water 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:13.009
 egg 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.570
 and when you finish put the whole dough 

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:17.180
 in a bottle how are you in a 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:19.939
 each bulb we heat our 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:22.850
 pan over medium heat and either with 

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:25.399
 butter or with oil let's put 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:27.290
 a little bit and with the napkin we are 

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:29.960
 all the excess 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:33.430
 this is an idea of ​​decoration that 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.430
 can put down 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:37.600
 If you do not have a bottle like this 

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:39.910
 as I mentioned you then use 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.370
 a spoon or better you can put everything 

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:44.380
 in a little bag without a block and make it 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:46.100
 bear and very carefully towards the 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.530
 designs 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:51.450
 look how beautiful it looks and this is one of 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:53.610
 the many ideas so we can 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.490
 you can also write the name nothing 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:59.219
 more than I'm going to write backwards leave it 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.409
 a lot of time because it has to highlight 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:03.630
 the time to flip our ranking 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:06.509
 then you can make a little heart or what 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.970
 that is them but stuffed and we hope 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:10.679
 for any life you can leave more 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:14.459
 time because I stay a little bit of credit 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:16.260
 my name and also for that so that I 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:19.459
 I do not lie anything else I have an idea that 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.459
 later I'll show you 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:35.130
 well let's continue let's focus on 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:38.010
 what can we do to make our plate 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:39.800
 it's decorated very nice so it's not 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:46.200
 just the dish 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:48.120
 but when we study ideas 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.190
 but here the father is that he can leave 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.590
 fly your imagination and do all kinds 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:55.470
 of figures 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:58.080
 like these this is a mini heart and it's 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:01.019
 very easy to do nothing more 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.900
 you squeeze a little and pull and squeeze 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:05.080
 mijares 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:07.330
 ah 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:09.850
 On the other hand, we are going to write a 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:12.520
 message first if we cut it for 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:15.750
 create a template we can decorate 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:18.460
 our plate with chocolate we put the 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:21.460
 rankings and we use the templates 

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:25.150
 well we really did and we discovered it 

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:27.880
 with icing sugar we remove a lot 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:29.320
 Take care and see how beautiful it looks here 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:31.630
 you can also let your 

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:33.670
 imagination and do all kinds of 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:36.040
 templates 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:37.830
 we put the mini hearts look what 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:40.900
 pretty 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:44.020
 while decorating another dish is 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:46.569
 sugar problem we put in the middle the 

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:49.569
 'ranking' we put our name and with 

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:53.819
 chocolate we would give you the letters too 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:53.819
 let's outline the outline of the heart 

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:58.210
 and with the same technique that we use 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:59.740
 to make the decoration that is 

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:03.150
 around the heart we can also 

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:03.150
 decorate our plate 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:08.750
 how fun it is to transform something that 

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:11.240
 we cooked so much that we were 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:14.080
 little ones with just a few details 

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:16.660
 do something 

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:19.570
 now remember that the valentine is 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:22.390
 just one day someone decided that 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:24.860
 outside the day of love and in many 

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:27.980
 but really the day of love has to 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:30.740
 be every day to show the 

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:34.810
 person that you love your mom so much 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:36.610
 to your friends to everyone and especially to one 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:38.919
