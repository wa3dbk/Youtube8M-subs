00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:35.150
 series of factors after the mother to be the 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:38.330

 now 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:51.960

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.650
 Ricardinho

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.410
 This is about this president. 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:21.519
 I have to think about this in the living era is 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:24.659
 the accident is beautiful and has several factors 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:24.659
 but is 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.190
 most of them are human error this is 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.900
 evident 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:35.420
 another part of the accident 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:38.110
 of the gold part but usually always 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.110
 the human error 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.210
 new and pomegranate 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:45.230
 Not that I say that the guy I was 

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:47.730
 I castrate castela up was heir 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:49.650
 may have been an error of another and perhaps 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:52.020
 to try to save the life of another 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:55.620
 try to get rid of a greater misfortune 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:58.110
 clamor is said to hunt the partners wait there 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:00.360
 that the partner has suffered one by one 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:04.500
 accident with something more claw and 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:07.080
 if only material damage and if it was mistake 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:08.310
 that he rethink their attitude in the 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:11.750
 road 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:16.820
 if it was only if it was tired, it was fatigue 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:16.820
 he rethink was not she that 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:24.609
 You will have the Q5 and anything and 

00:03:21.969 --> 00:03:26.170
 annoys morning there with the scene asserting 

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:29.140
 my truck is stolen 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:34.989
 the same way that anyone who sees a truck 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:36.760
 tombar only judges after that in this 

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:38.769
 time or talk after the game ends 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:44.049
 who does not know the result 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:46.989
 I want to see you guys before and unfortunately 

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:47.889
 this kind of thing're subject everyone 

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:51.849
 subject 

00:03:47.889 --> 00:03:53.260
 what I ask is that who does the inside 

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:56.019
 yes on the road 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:59.139
 the day incorrectly reflects the 

00:03:56.019 --> 00:04:01.209
 how much time and how much disorder 

00:03:59.139 --> 00:04:05.200
 can cause in your daily life 

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:07.750
 after seeing a scene of these idps this 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:10.750
 how much will you lose if how much you 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:13.450
 It will be hurt by this as you 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:17.229
 sometimes had to deal with the issue 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:19.729
 of a well-stealing attitude 

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:24.590
 serve as an example so that people 

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:29.050
 reflect and has 15 as attitude 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:29.050
 and regardless of whether there is an accident 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:34.930
 it is as if the request did not cause the 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:39.010
 accident but could have prevented 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:42.060
 Thank you Tribal guys too on the 20th
