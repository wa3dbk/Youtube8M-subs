00:06:18.589 --> 00:06:21.049 

should<00:06:19.589> not<00:06:19.740> have<00:06:19.800> been<00:06:20.039> treated<00:06:20.490> the<00:06:20.879> way

00:06:21.049 --> 00:06:21.059 
should not have been treated the way

00:06:21.059 --> 00:06:23.389 
should not have been treated the way
that<00:06:21.599> we<00:06:21.749> were<00:06:21.959> treated<00:06:22.469> but<00:06:22.800> i<00:06:22.919> think<00:06:23.159> it<00:06:23.309> was

00:06:23.389 --> 00:06:23.399 
that we were treated but i think it was

00:06:23.399 --> 00:06:30.109 
that we were treated but i think it was
part<00:06:23.759> of<00:06:23.909> the<00:06:26.270> American<00:06:28.759> notion<00:06:29.759> of<00:06:29.879> white

00:06:30.109 --> 00:06:30.119 
part of the American notion of white

00:06:30.119 --> 00:06:33.230 
part of the American notion of white
supremacy<00:06:30.360> and<00:06:31.199> I<00:06:32.159> think<00:06:32.550> they<00:06:32.669> were<00:06:32.729> treated

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:33.240 
supremacy and I think they were treated

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:37.309 
supremacy and I think they were treated
like<00:06:33.389> an<00:06:33.569> inferior<00:06:34.139> race<00:06:34.469> and<00:06:35.990> in<00:06:36.990> the<00:06:37.110> same

00:06:37.309 --> 00:06:37.319 
like an inferior race and in the same

00:06:37.319 --> 00:06:39.769 
like an inferior race and in the same
way<00:06:37.559> that<00:06:37.830> Indians<00:06:38.490> are<00:06:38.699> treated<00:06:39.089> badly<00:06:39.389> and

00:06:39.769 --> 00:06:39.779 
way that Indians are treated badly and

00:06:39.779 --> 00:06:42.129 
way that Indians are treated badly and
the<00:06:39.929> slaves<00:06:40.289> were<00:06:40.469> treated<00:06:40.919> even<00:06:41.039> worse<00:06:41.429> I

00:06:42.129 --> 00:06:42.139 
the slaves were treated even worse I

00:06:42.139 --> 00:06:45.739 
the slaves were treated even worse I
think<00:06:43.139> was<00:06:43.259> part<00:06:43.589> of<00:06:43.709> America's<00:06:44.429> racism<00:06:45.179> that

00:06:45.739 --> 00:06:45.749 
think was part of America's racism that

00:06:45.749 --> 00:06:50.439 
think was part of America's racism that
we<00:06:45.990> ended<00:06:46.860> up<00:06:46.979> in<00:06:47.039> those<00:06:47.369> camps
