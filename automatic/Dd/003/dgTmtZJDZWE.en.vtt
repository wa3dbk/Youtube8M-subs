is<00:00:28.369> Phillies<00:00:29.369> hunting<00:00:29.880> knife<00:00:30.060> I<00:00:30.330> think

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
is Phillies hunting knife I think

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.450 
is Phillies hunting knife I think
there's<00:00:30.689> and<00:00:30.900> said<00:00:31.529> the<00:00:31.650> quest<00:00:31.890> stands<00:00:32.189> upon

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
there's and said the quest stands upon

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:33.950 
there's and said the quest stands upon
the<00:00:32.489> edge<00:00:32.730> of<00:00:32.850> the<00:00:32.969> knife<00:00:33.090> so<00:00:33.450> is<00:00:33.570> it<00:00:33.600> probably

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
the edge of the knife so is it probably

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.930 
the edge of the knife so is it probably

like it they just slide it back in there
and<00:03:18.940> it's<00:03:19.360> some<00:03:19.630> rest<00:03:19.870> and<00:03:20.260> the<00:03:21.220> last<00:03:21.400> one

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:21.610 
and it's some rest and the last one

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:24.120 
and it's some rest and the last one
probably<00:03:22.300> the<00:03:22.420> coolest<00:03:22.540> is<00:03:23.320> to<00:03:23.739> which<00:03:23.860> King

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.130 
probably the coolest is to which King

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:25.920 
probably the coolest is to which King
Sagar<00:03:24.370> I<00:03:24.610> just<00:03:25.209> really<00:03:25.450> like<00:03:25.600> the<00:03:25.750> way<00:03:25.780> it

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
Sagar I just really like the way it

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:28.080 
Sagar I just really like the way it
looks<00:03:26.040> so<00:03:27.040> it's<00:03:27.130> got<00:03:27.250> 30<00:03:27.430> damage<00:03:27.700> so<00:03:27.970> it's

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 
looks so it's got 30 damage so it's

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:30.210 
looks so it's got 30 damage so it's
probably<00:03:28.239> like<00:03:28.480> really<00:03:29.470> low<00:03:29.680> for<00:03:30.040> like

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.220 
probably like really low for like

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:32.670 
probably like really low for like
endgame<00:03:30.730> sort<00:03:31.030> of<00:03:31.120> stuff<00:03:31.330> but<00:03:32.230> it<00:03:32.440> just<00:03:32.590> looks

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680 
endgame sort of stuff but it just looks

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.280 
endgame sort of stuff but it just looks
so<00:03:33.070> pointy<00:03:33.550> so<00:03:34.270> do<00:03:34.480> not<00:03:34.660> know<00:03:34.840> death<00:03:35.080> when<00:03:35.260> you

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
so pointy so do not know death when you

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:37.290 
so pointy so do not know death when you
see<00:03:35.560> it<00:03:35.650> while<00:03:35.950> wearing<00:03:36.250> this<00:03:36.400> or<00:03:36.850> equipping

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:37.300 
see it while wearing this or equipping

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:40.710 
see it while wearing this or equipping
this<00:03:37.510> people<00:03:38.440> are<00:03:38.590> gonna<00:03:38.770> die<00:03:38.940> because<00:03:39.940> you

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:40.720 
this people are gonna die because you

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.180 
this people are gonna die because you
can<00:03:40.870> barely<00:03:41.200> see<00:03:41.440> it<00:03:41.560> when<00:03:41.709> you<00:03:41.739> swing<00:03:42.040> because

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:42.190 
can barely see it when you swing because

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:43.740 
can barely see it when you swing because
it's<00:03:42.400> so<00:03:42.580> small<00:03:42.880> and<00:03:43.150> you<00:03:43.209> can<00:03:43.300> barely<00:03:43.480> see<00:03:43.690> it

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:43.750 
it's so small and you can barely see it

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:45.479 
it's so small and you can barely see it
