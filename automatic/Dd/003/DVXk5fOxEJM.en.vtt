over the years about what hit points
mean<00:03:39.459> let's<00:03:40.459> take<00:03:40.640> a<00:03:40.670> look<00:03:40.910> and<00:03:41.060> see<00:03:41.120> what<00:03:41.300> the

the one that nails you in the chest so
it<00:04:57.770> doesn't<00:04:58.310> necessarily<00:04:58.600> represent<00:04:59.600> like<00:04:59.750> in

00:04:59.920 --> 00:04:59.930 
it doesn't necessarily represent like in

it doesn't necessarily represent like in
a<00:04:59.990> video<00:05:00.260> game<00:05:00.320> that<00:05:00.830> you're<00:05:00.979> running<00:05:01.340> around

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:01.460 
a video game that you're running around

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:04.090 
a video game that you're running around
and<00:05:02.060> you've<00:05:02.780> got<00:05:02.990> half<00:05:03.380> a<00:05:03.560> dozen<00:05:03.740> arrows

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:04.100 
and you've got half a dozen arrows

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:07.000 
and you've got half a dozen arrows
sticking<00:05:04.580> out<00:05:04.880> of<00:05:05.000> your<00:05:05.030> body<00:05:05.650> so<00:05:06.650> just<00:05:06.889> keep

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:07.010 
sticking out of your body so just keep

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:08.590 
sticking out of your body so just keep
that<00:05:07.070> in<00:05:07.400> mind<00:05:07.580> it's<00:05:07.850> it's<00:05:08.060> an<00:05:08.210> abstract

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:08.600 
that in mind it's it's an abstract

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:12.600 
that in mind it's it's an abstract
system<00:05:09.320> is<00:05:10.510> representative<00:05:11.510> of<00:05:11.690> the<00:05:11.840> battle

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:12.610 
system is representative of the battle

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:15.580 
system is representative of the battle
it's<00:05:13.610> not<00:05:13.910> necessarily<00:05:14.690> representative<00:05:15.289> of

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:15.590 
it's not necessarily representative of

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:18.629 
it's not necessarily representative of
each<00:05:15.860> and<00:05:16.190> every<00:05:16.400> single<00:05:17.120> wound<00:05:17.300> that<00:05:17.539> you<00:05:17.750> get

00:05:18.629 --> 00:05:18.639 
each and every single wound that you get

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:21.550 
each and every single wound that you get
so<00:05:19.639> that's<00:05:20.240> an<00:05:20.419> old<00:05:20.630> debate<00:05:20.990> that's<00:05:21.199> going<00:05:21.320> on

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:21.560 
so that's an old debate that's going on

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:25.000 
so that's an old debate that's going on
for<00:05:21.919> many<00:05:22.010> years<00:05:22.160> and<00:05:23.200> that's<00:05:24.200> led<00:05:24.530> to<00:05:24.710> a<00:05:24.740> lot

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:25.010 
for many years and that's led to a lot

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:28.600 
for many years and that's led to a lot
of<00:05:25.130> people<00:05:25.280> debating<00:05:25.910> about<00:05:26.889> how<00:05:27.889> armor<00:05:28.370> works

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:28.610 
of people debating about how armor works

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:34.210 
of people debating about how armor works
you<00:05:29.210> know<00:05:29.360> well<00:05:29.570> your<00:05:30.289> armor<00:05:30.740> is<00:05:33.100> making<00:05:34.100> you

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:34.220 
you know well your armor is making you

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:39.279 
you know well your armor is making you
harder<00:05:35.229> what<00:05:36.229> is<00:05:36.349> it<00:05:36.500> harder<00:05:37.310> to<00:05:37.490> hit<00:05:38.289> armor

00:05:39.279 --> 00:05:39.289 
harder what is it harder to hit armor

00:05:39.289 --> 00:05:40.990 
harder what is it harder to hit armor
doesn't<00:05:39.470> make<00:05:39.830> you<00:05:39.979> harder<00:05:40.280> to<00:05:40.400> hit<00:05:40.550> it<00:05:40.729> slows

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:41.000 
doesn't make you harder to hit it slows

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.240 
doesn't make you harder to hit it slows
you<00:05:41.030> down<00:05:41.180> it<00:05:41.690> makes<00:05:41.870> you<00:05:42.110> easier<00:05:42.919> to<00:05:43.010> hit

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:43.250 
you down it makes you easier to hit

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:46.180 
you down it makes you easier to hit
because<00:05:43.400> you're<00:05:43.700> slower<00:05:44.030> but<00:05:44.389> it<00:05:44.690> it<00:05:45.289> absorbs

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:46.190 
because you're slower but it it absorbs

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:49.330 
because you're slower but it it absorbs
damage<00:05:46.280> and<00:05:47.020> then<00:05:48.020> people<00:05:48.260> get<00:05:48.560> into<00:05:48.860> using

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:49.340 
damage and then people get into using

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:52.719 
damage and then people get into using
armor<00:05:49.760> as<00:05:49.970> damage<00:05:50.389> reduction<00:05:50.690> and<00:05:51.580> then<00:05:52.580> you

00:05:52.719 --> 00:05:52.729 
armor as damage reduction and then you

00:05:52.729 --> 00:05:55.710 
armor as damage reduction and then you
get<00:05:52.880> into<00:05:53.000> a<00:05:53.150> whole<00:05:53.389> problem<00:05:53.660> there<00:05:54.310> when

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:55.720 
get into a whole problem there when

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:57.520 
get into a whole problem there when
weapons<00:05:56.720> that<00:05:56.930> should<00:05:57.200> be<00:05:57.349> considered

00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:57.530 
weapons that should be considered

00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:00.250 
weapons that should be considered
dangerous<00:05:58.039> can't<00:05:58.669> penetrate<00:05:58.940> the<00:05:59.270> armor<00:05:59.630> so

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:00.260 
dangerous can't penetrate the armor so

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:01.600 
dangerous can't penetrate the armor so
then<00:06:00.440> you<00:06:00.590> think<00:06:00.620> about<00:06:01.039> well<00:06:01.220> how<00:06:01.370> do<00:06:01.430> you

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:01.610 
then you think about well how do you

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:03.730 
then you think about well how do you
make<00:06:01.789> daggers<00:06:02.270> dangerous<00:06:02.960> against<00:06:03.410> a<00:06:03.500> fully

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:03.740 
make daggers dangerous against a fully

make daggers dangerous against a fully
armored<00:06:04.190> opponent<00:06:04.669> well<00:06:05.630> then<00:06:05.780> you<00:06:05.870> have<00:06:05.900> to

00:06:06.129 --> 00:06:06.139 
armored opponent well then you have to

00:06:06.139 --> 00:06:07.719 
armored opponent well then you have to
figure<00:06:06.320> out<00:06:06.620> some<00:06:06.860> way<00:06:07.039> to<00:06:07.070> do<00:06:07.310> finesse

00:06:07.719 --> 00:06:07.729 
figure out some way to do finesse

00:06:07.729 --> 00:06:10.000 
figure out some way to do finesse
attacks<00:06:08.120> or<00:06:08.510> called<00:06:09.020> shots<00:06:09.380> or<00:06:09.680> something

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:11.320 
attacks or called shots or something
like<00:06:10.099> that<00:06:10.160> it<00:06:10.430> leads<00:06:10.580> to<00:06:10.789> a<00:06:10.820> whole<00:06:11.030> bunch<00:06:11.210> of

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:11.330 
like that it leads to a whole bunch of

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:15.219 
like that it leads to a whole bunch of
other<00:06:11.450> complications<00:06:13.419> this<00:06:14.419> is<00:06:14.599> just<00:06:14.810> keeping

00:06:15.219 --> 00:06:15.229 
other complications this is just keeping

00:06:15.229 --> 00:06:17.680 
other complications this is just keeping
it<00:06:15.320> simple<00:06:15.530> from<00:06:16.099> its<00:06:16.280> old<00:06:16.580> roots<00:06:16.910> it<00:06:17.210> keeps<00:06:17.479> it

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:17.690 
it simple from its old roots it keeps it

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:21.129 
it simple from its old roots it keeps it
simple<00:06:19.120> remember<00:06:20.120> it's<00:06:20.270> abstract<00:06:20.690> when

00:06:21.129 --> 00:06:21.139 
simple remember it's abstract when

00:06:21.139 --> 00:06:22.690 
simple remember it's abstract when
you're<00:06:21.289> hit<00:06:21.530> it<00:06:21.710> doesn't<00:06:22.130> mean<00:06:22.310> that<00:06:22.340> you're

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:22.700 
you're hit it doesn't mean that you're

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:25.240 
you're hit it doesn't mean that you're
necessarily<00:06:23.470> bleeding<00:06:24.470> at<00:06:24.620> that<00:06:24.800> point<00:06:25.130> it

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:25.250 
necessarily bleeding at that point it

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:26.290 
necessarily bleeding at that point it
doesn't<00:06:25.430> mean<00:06:25.760> that<00:06:25.789> you're<00:06:26.150> necessarily

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:26.300 
doesn't mean that you're necessarily

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:30.159 
doesn't mean that you're necessarily
struck<00:06:27.260> it<00:06:27.979> ramin<00:06:28.969> that<00:06:29.240> you<00:06:29.419> have<00:06:29.570> avoided<00:06:30.080> a

00:06:30.159 --> 00:06:30.169 
struck it ramin that you have avoided a

00:06:30.169 --> 00:06:32.050 
struck it ramin that you have avoided a
threat<00:06:30.530> and<00:06:30.830> you're<00:06:31.099> still<00:06:31.340> on<00:06:31.490> your<00:06:31.580> feet<00:06:31.849> and

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:32.060 
threat and you're still on your feet and

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:33.190 
threat and you're still on your feet and
surviving

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:33.200 
surviving

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:36.940 
surviving
so<00:06:34.210> your<00:06:35.210> armor<00:06:35.690> helps<00:06:36.050> protect<00:06:36.290> you<00:06:36.740> from

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:36.950 
so your armor helps protect you from

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:40.090 
so your armor helps protect you from
those<00:06:37.160> threats<00:06:37.610> in<00:06:37.910> most<00:06:38.270> cases<00:06:38.920> so<00:06:39.920> that's

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:40.100 
those threats in most cases so that's

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:43.540 
those threats in most cases so that's
what<00:06:40.370> that's<00:06:40.970> representative<00:06:42.100> so<00:06:43.100> those

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:43.550 
what that's representative so those

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:45.760 
what that's representative so those
words<00:06:43.850> are<00:06:44.060> just<00:06:44.270> for<00:06:44.480> me<00:06:44.660> my<00:06:44.690> opinions<00:06:45.410> as<00:06:45.620> an

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:45.770 
words are just for me my opinions as an

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:49.320 
words are just for me my opinions as an
as<00:06:45.980> a<00:06:46.180> gamer<00:06:47.180> going<00:06:47.600> back<00:06:47.780> all<00:06:48.020> the<00:06:48.140> way<00:06:48.290> to

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:49.330 
as a gamer going back all the way to

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:54.550 
as a gamer going back all the way to
nineteen<00:06:51.640> nineteen<00:06:52.640> eighty-two<00:06:52.880> I<00:06:53.410> guess<00:06:54.410> is

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:54.560 
nineteen nineteen eighty-two I guess is

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:58.150 
nineteen nineteen eighty-two I guess is
when<00:06:54.740> I<00:06:54.770> started<00:06:56.110> so<00:06:57.110> there<00:06:57.290> we<00:06:57.380> go<00:06:57.410> that<00:06:57.950> is

00:06:58.150 --> 00:06:58.160 
when I started so there we go that is

00:06:58.160 --> 00:06:59.980 
when I started so there we go that is
the<00:06:58.280> end<00:06:58.430> of<00:06:58.550> that<00:06:58.730> round<00:06:59.000> we'll<00:06:59.570> pick<00:06:59.780> it<00:06:59.810> up

00:06:59.980 --> 00:06:59.990 
the end of that round we'll pick it up

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:03.250 
the end of that round we'll pick it up
with<00:07:00.230> my<00:07:00.440> dwarf<00:07:00.740> next
