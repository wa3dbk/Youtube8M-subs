 Fishtanktv.com on a beautiful Sunday. I don't know how much of Sunday like this we are going to have to leave. Frankly, I want to snow it because I want to go snowboarding, but that is a very different story. It is Sunday. It's kind of a Sunday. I have been fired. I start off sundays off with something special. I'm outside because it's a good day and my daughter's sleep. So the lead off hitter, the number one factory for the current Sunday types, how it started today, Sunday types. Dwarf Sag. This stuff is the shit. Let me see why. Ok so I have dwarf Sag here. Dwarf Sagittaria. Probably grows 4-5 centimeters. Remains low. You can trim it. You can cut. This plant is incredible. There are many different types of archer. I have this breed. I also have some greater variety in my tank. My 90 neon tank that I do a water change. Large, large beginner plant. Gives you good luck early and often. Grows well and it is very hardy. Here's how hardy is. If I had Bryan's camera I would go underwater and show you. Oh, that's cold. This is also dwarf sag from my pond. So you're getting it here. You understand it's cold, it's freezing, this stuff survives the winter. I don't know where it comes from, I have to look it up. Exactly the same types here. Like a tree. Grows great, love it. I mean, if you want to do a simple tank, do dirt, drop dwarf and do Jungle Fall, and forget it. I mean, it will look as cool as hell. So big, big fan of archer in general. I personally don't have too many different varieties, but I probably have to look up how many there are. If someone else has other races, place a photo or video. Lead off hitter today, grabbed some from my pond. If anyone wants a part of this just a shitload of it. Of course I can grow it in my pond so ... Let me know. I also have a ... well I later on the sword. Yes, Dwarf Sag. Done first today. There is a reason for that. It is a large, large, large plant. You get a few dwarf sag people. You will not be disappointed. The only beef I have with it is that it can take on plants such as crypts and things like that. But it is a good beginner factory and it will give you great success from the shoot. There you go. Types of Sundays, lead off hitter, dwarf sagittarias.
