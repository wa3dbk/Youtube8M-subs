00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:02.620
This vlog is presented to you by...

00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:04.640
NOBODY GIVES A **** ABOUT NAMES

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:06.570
Whatever, I've got something to say though.

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:11.800
A while ago, I was asked via YouTube message if I had ever thought about the meaning of life.

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:13.150
"Ever"!

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:17.000
I didn't write back, but decided to make a

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:23.060
I already explained recently that I want to get rid of that notion I had in earlier vlogs at times -

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:34.880
the notion that if I talk about a topic in a vlog, I have to get to some kind of all-explaining conclusion at the end.

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:38.630
That's not a recommendable way to cover these kinds of topics I talk about here.

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:43.700
That makes a lot of topics impossible to cover, and "the meaning of life" is such a topic.

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:55.870
Because if you want to find a "solution" to that problem so that viewers can say: all right, that explains it - you won't get far.

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:02.110
In other words: If I pretended to have an actual solution to the problem of the meaning of life,

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:05.340
that would be quite the most enormous case of bragging ever.

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:13.620
I mean, that problem has been tried to solve by, like, all of humanity. Some think about it more than others, but everyone considers it.

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:18.250
So yeah... I shouldn't claim being able to solve that out of thin air. Or in general.

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:24.290
And nobody should. I mean, just imagine someone would actually find THE one answer -

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:29.100
The headlines in the newspapers: "Meaning of life found. Also: Congress argues over debt reducing policy."

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:31.810
(That was the most ageless headline I could think of.)

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:36.620
In Wikipedia, somewhere between the list of fictional ducks [I did NOT make that up o.0]

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:41.060
and the article about Lost Springs, Wyoming (a town with 4 inhabitants), there would be a page saying: "The meaning of life is..."

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:52.170
If you're now wondering what Wikipedia does say about the meaning of life - they avoid the issue by saying it is a question.

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:58.580
Now that was quite a long introduction just to say that I... don't know it either.

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:01.410
But I do have some thoughts on the topic.

00:01:36.620 --> 00:02:13.910
That's like explaining a word using the word itself. You still have the same question: When can you say that your life has a meaning?

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:19.020
You're just shifting the problem. It's a bit like that advice to "be yourself".

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:28.590
It didn't help me in general. What I've found more helpful has been thinking about what the meaning of life surely is NOT.

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.740
And I'm quite sure about some points there.

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:36.310
After all, what you do with your life should at least be something that COULD be the right answer to the question about the meaning of life.

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:42.360
You can't know it, but you can be close or far away from it - and I think you're very far away if you

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:52.080
let your life be dominated by a system of irrelevant, short-lived, frustrating, stressful changes in the price of something - the stock market.

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:59.800
Some people seem to feel very important as soon as they're wearing a tie and a suit and make banal things sound like sharp analyses.

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:07.510
By the way, if you disagree to my notion that stock exchange rates are mostly random, please explain this experiment to me:

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:16.600
A distinguished "analyst", Wolf Drees, had his prediction skills tested there.

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:17.600
He lost.

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:18.970
His opponent was...

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.280
a CAMEL.

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:28.040
And that's not the only such result. I can't help but finding stock exchange news involuntarily funny...

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:32.310
All I can think about it is: Are you really, REALLY taking this stuff this seriously?

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:36.640
It is not the meaning of life to complete it with as little damage as possible.

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:40.580
Which is a bit inconvenient for me to say because that is sort of my weakness there.

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:49.150
It's not what I believe in, but I often can't help but wanting to take the safest, the most convenient way.

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:53.900
My personal record for the longest time with no notable ups or downs stands at four months.

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:58.550
Let's just get through this somehow - that's not how it's intended.

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:02.150
(And it's a different question if life was "intended" in any way.)

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:07.300
I would also claim that the meaning of life is surely not power, but maybe that's a matter of taste.

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:11.960
But I'm a bit puzzled about people who base their success in life on injustice - I'm not sure where that's supposed to go.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:24.310
I mean, bad stuff from your past can always backfire on you, and how can you be happy if you have to fear that backfiring?

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:28.460
Maybe why I'm puzzled about that is that I believe it always does backfire - maybe some people just don't think that will happen to them.

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:35.450
By the way, I wasn't referring to some sort of afterlife there, I don't believe there's something as an afterlife.

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:46.350
But I like how that is theoretically a question that can't be answered - because I don't want to KNOW there's no afterlife.

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:52.920
I mean, just imagine there would somehow be a proof that there's now afterlife - how depressing would that be?

00:04:52.960 --> 00:05:01.750
I want to at least be able to imagine what could be there - even though I don't believe there is anything.

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:14.340
What I would love would be that these economy twerps etc. wouldn't be told: TO HELL WITH YOU!, but rather something like:

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:16.310
Sorry, but you missed the topic!

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:23.300
Also, because I'm sure this would otherwise be claimed in the comments: Near death experiences are as little a proof for an afterlife

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:28.040
as reports of Magic Mushroom consumers are a proof that there are talking elephants.

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:31.500
Okay, I think I went a bit off topic there. And I'll just do that again now.

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:35.220
On this issue, I just have to also talk about my hobby quite a bit.

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:40.990
The other half of this channel - there are not just the vlogs, but also the dominoes.

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:48.780
Aaaand this is a cool moment for all domino colleagues who are not really interested in vlogs, but did watch this one until here - it was worth it! Emm, so -

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:56.700
What this has to do with the topic - we are, ironically, often confronted with the reproach: You don't understand the meaning of life!

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:04.810
I mean, what else does it mean if someone says that I "don't have a life" or need to "get a hobby" - which is funny when we're talking about my hobby -

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:08.330
or I would have too much time on my hands and certainly was a virgin, too...

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:11.050
[intranslatable pun]

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:14.820
Basically, what is meant is: Dude, that's a waste of time.

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:21.380
And there is some truth in that - everyone of you other domino-builders has to admit that.

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:32.420
But the thing is: You could say that to almost everyone. Because incredibly many pastimes could be called "meaningless".

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:41.010
Practise pole vault every week. Play CoD. Watch Two and a Half Men... which nobody will mention as an hobby of theirs, but it's something they spend time with.

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:44.960
Making vlogs about what you find most annoying about Facebook!

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.840
Speaking of Facebook, maybe you know that I'm proudly NOT using Facebook - and I could give back that reproach there.

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:52.870
Like, You're on Facebook all the time...? Dude, get a life.

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:57.750
Now if someone wants to reply: Yeah, but playing CoD is FUN, and that's why I do it.

00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:02.060
Well guess what, I find my hobby fun, too. I wouldn't do it otherwise...

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:07.610
I think the question whether something is "meaningful" is practically answered by how many people claim it to be.

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:15.180
If games were an extremly unusual hobby, they would surely be looked at the same way creating beautiful stuff with dominoes is now.

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:19.020
Yeah, I actually just wanted to mention that marginally. It's just a wide topic.

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:25.310
I probably don't have to ask you explicitly to leave your opinions in the comments. Hm, I can't get break the habit of this gesture although I hate it.

00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:29.890
And now, here's the big surprise at the end of this video.

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:32.080
Someone has in fact found the meaning of life. Here, this guy who you are about to see^^

00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:37.650
who I felt a bit of sympathy for when he lost - but mostly I was cheering enthusiastically^^,

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:39.790
...he knows what counts!

00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:59.450
Oh, by the way, the answer is probably love. That's what I believe. But... I don't know.
