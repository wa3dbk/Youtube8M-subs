00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:16.030
 hey friends and therefore cordial 

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:18.369
 Welcome to a new video chat 

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:21.550
 and I am on one today 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:25.060
 other game, not fifa saw 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:26.529
 on promotion soccer 2015 maybe 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:29.919
 you can know its know 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:32.950
 and yes, I think there is actually 

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:34.960
 relatively cheap is, so to speak, far ahead 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:36.790
 at least since I was yesterday have 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.530
 I took my time to make it a time 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:41.860
 to test out a bit but I have to say 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:44.170
 it is much more complicated than fifa 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:45.880
 due and that is what I wanted to do today 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:48.280
 I'll make a little pony on it 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:50.080
 Here's how they pack two for free and then 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.430
 somehow also in all store again 

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:54.850
 A few degrees respect we meet 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:57.340
 to reach 55, I do not know 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:59.590
 what should that be gold page or something like that 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:01.990
 You can just kind of pull those black ones 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:04.530
 or open this golden band shown 

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:06.670
 now this one first 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.960
 As I said I do not know me so well 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:09.880
 so I do not know 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.380
 yes, I think that's a very good thing 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:15.009
 with three but I still have the 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:18.729
 chance for a good ball maybe 

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:21.039
 yes a golden or black or 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:27.869
 white no names 

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:31.109
 yes i do not think so well 62 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.109
 we say 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:40.399
 Okay, well, karat agrees another is like that 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:46.460
 we come already to the next 

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:49.039
 day not okay so I know 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:51.469
 but he can be the golden one at that 

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:54.409
 we can get black clicks 

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:55.849
 then yes so I'm curious 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:59.709
 maybe there is a small one 

00:01:55.849 --> 00:02:02.270
 trick but no, apparently not a pity 

00:01:59.709 --> 00:02:05.209
 can count off how much then always 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:08.539
 another is that I do not know 

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:10.190
 notion why not such a system like this or 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:14.959
 probably have to go back now 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:17.060
 then here is one exactly and there we have 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:20.920
 also a free play there you can now 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:28.250
 only black wave pull so I hope 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:30.109
 that we now choose and how children 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.620
 decided because watch wants it 

00:02:30.109 --> 00:02:38.989
 thought 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:42.019
 and who is hey my good I have 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:43.250
 already a little anticipated cool ideas 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:45.109
 we definitely need the 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:47.389
 Add mannheimer to the club 

00:02:45.109 --> 00:02:49.310
 first time here so later in our 

00:02:47.389 --> 00:02:50.870
 pack and may be 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:52.700
 i also play with it but i do 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:54.919
 do not know yet quite so now 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:58.340
 we still think five pieces of 

00:02:54.919 --> 00:03:01.040
 open this that the percentage of 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:04.280
 the black a bit lower 56 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:06.919
 and speaks to the golden 84.4 so 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:08.180
 you do not pull gold and black like that 

00:03:06.919 --> 00:03:09.889
 I'm happy again then 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:12.109
 unfortunately my camera is just now 

00:03:09.889 --> 00:03:15.500
 Going out then I want to say click 

00:03:12.109 --> 00:03:16.880
 Let's just go back and we will 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.480
 Hope we have a black ball 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:21.319
 pull 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:25.099
 yes oh my god I'm quite like that 

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:28.060
 bad did not think ibrahimovic 

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:28.060
 that's it 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:39.959
 oh my god i can not do anything 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:44.799
 on it clear 4 90s overall rating 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:47.260
 Head ibrahimovic in god and the 

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:51.030
 always in the first right field yourself 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:54.400
 so to speak himself on paid coins 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:55.329
 my good ibrahimovic age I thought 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.569
 OK 

00:03:55.329 --> 00:04:00.459
 At this bob I can catch the back and there 

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:02.680
 afterwards that is clearly what bidder 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:06.010
 or relate one or I very high 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:09.400
 Only packs truth is I goodness 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:11.079
 We are not lucky here 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:15.329
 tough feelings once to our club 

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:17.320
 Added friends 

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:18.759
 You can not add any other players 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:23.919
 Obligate as there are no vacancies 

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:25.630
 what have the head with me now 

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:28.750
 do not know so I'll talk 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:29.259
 try a few places free too 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:30.849
 to get 

00:04:29.259 --> 00:04:32.229
 in any case , for one thing, the other 

00:04:30.849 --> 00:04:35.229
 should not work then it was too 

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:36.550
 with the video friends so am already 

00:04:35.229 --> 00:04:38.860
 I create a few now 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:40.750
 my squad thrown out and 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:41.800
 I have targeted ibrahimovic but even 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:43.570
 not if she sees how good that 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:46.300
 Actually, as I said, I know 

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:48.010
 I'm not great with pro 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:50.050
 evolution soccer it was simply prefer 

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:52.360
 before I emphasize something wrong again 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:53.979
 so I would say first now 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:56.409
 couple midfielder pack and 

00:04:53.979 --> 00:05:01.690
 maybe we have luck like him 

00:04:56.409 --> 00:05:02.199
 even with our load the curve once 

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:04.000
 drawn 

00:05:02.199 --> 00:05:05.259
 but I think golden is too 

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:09.400
 not so bad I hope 

00:05:05.259 --> 00:05:11.349
 at least then I have two then 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:14.320
 I do not know how long now the 

00:05:11.349 --> 00:05:15.220
 lasts until they come but maybe 

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:17.560
 we are back 

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:22.139
 yes oh my god how happy i am 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:22.139
 finally i am so good in there 

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:27.639
 savio i really thought is the 

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:29.919
 However, overall knowledge would have 

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:31.880
 sorry that is not bad 

00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:36.050
 and the controller more 

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:38.210
 am also really bright blue xavier I roy 

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:40.700
 think more you can already and 

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:46.400
 just adding that's my kind of 

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:48.890
 kader has the same as said 

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:51.830
 I'm totally there, we immediately come to 

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:53.750
 So blind in this game you have to me 

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:58.130
 they know we open now 

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:59.480
 I've got a defender 

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:02.420
 even her just noticed that it 

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:11.750
 different positions for that 

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:13.010
 so it looks like it takes time and again 

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:14.540
 a bit longer than there and me 

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:16.400
 always different but now pulling 

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:19.940
 Let's have a golden ball 

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:27.530
 let's see what we are for a player 

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:30.890
 get scissors 770 of 

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:34.190
 Overall rating is not bad 

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:35.570
 works and I think then we have 

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:37.640
 one more day and i would say it 

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:39.170
 me still a midfield falls to me 

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:41.960
 usually possible to have fun there too 

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:43.990
 open so I actually find 

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:46.820
 not so bad the animation 

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:47.930
 I do not think that plays badly 

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:51.940
 I actually think of a whole game 

00:06:47.930 --> 00:07:03.190
 already made quite cool 

00:06:51.940 --> 00:07:07.060
 no no dear stupid or lukas silver 

00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:10.750
 ok 67er overall rating 

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:13.240
 76 sorry so i know now but me 

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:14.889
 think now have a space free them 

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:16.810
 do not think it on request here now 

00:07:14.889 --> 00:07:18.730
 first the antique one wide 

00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:21.639
 Now we take in midfield or 

00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:25.660
 In the storm, then we will open 

00:07:21.639 --> 00:07:26.980
 A die away to the conclusion and whether 

00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:29.320
 I say we are actually relative 

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:35.050
 well as these get by mail so 

00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:36.669
 very good and very tricky as well 

00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:40.419
 After the last black we pull the 

00:07:36.669 --> 00:07:42.639
 ball press needs so and then 

00:07:40.419 --> 00:07:45.400
 Let's hope that we may have one 

00:07:42.639 --> 00:07:45.760
 get dark green how is that unfortunately 

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:48.460
 Not 

00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:52.200
 unfortunately not the golden one, unfortunately 

00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:52.200
 yes, it does not have to be that bad 

00:07:53.610 --> 00:07:58.900
 money money 

00:07:55.919 --> 00:08:01.750
 okay that 's it opec so I'm relative 

00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:03.850
 so happy with this pack 

00:08:01.750 --> 00:08:04.990
 opening, so to speak, is drawn by the way 

00:08:03.850 --> 00:08:06.130
 what do you want more? 

00:08:04.990 --> 00:08:07.510
 I would say that was it, too 

00:08:06.130 --> 00:08:11.430
 already with the video I'm out skin 

00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:11.430
 Go on until next time and ciao
