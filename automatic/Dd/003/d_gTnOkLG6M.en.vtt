00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
gonna have to sit in a window and watch

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.020 
gonna have to sit in a window and watch
the<00:01:34.650> sniper<00:01:34.890> the<00:01:35.070> whole<00:01:35.159> time<00:01:35.369> or<00:01:35.549> you're

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
the sniper the whole time or you're

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.999 
the sniper the whole time or you're
gonna<00:01:36.150> have<00:01:36.299> to<00:01:36.390> get<00:01:36.689> a<00:01:36.750> sniper<00:01:37.350> yourself<00:01:37.799> and

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
gonna have to get a sniper yourself and

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.350 
gonna have to get a sniper yourself and
just<00:01:38.280> sit<00:01:38.520> there<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:38.850> whole<00:01:38.939> time<00:01:39.000> it's

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
just sit there the whole time it's

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.940 
just sit there the whole time it's
boring<00:01:39.750> then<00:01:40.079> you<00:01:40.170> do<00:01:40.320> something<00:01:40.650> to<00:01:40.829> enhance

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940 
guns not only does this add a lot more

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:14.790 
guns not only does this add a lot more
depth<00:03:13.300> to<00:03:13.450> the<00:03:13.570> game<00:03:13.780> it<00:03:14.290> also<00:03:14.470> gives<00:03:14.710> you

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:14.800 
depth to the game it also gives you

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.530 
depth to the game it also gives you
something<00:03:15.070> more<00:03:15.340> to<00:03:15.520> do<00:03:15.640> rather<00:03:16.000> than<00:03:16.180> playing

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540 
something more to do rather than playing

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:18.300 
something more to do rather than playing
the<00:03:16.630> objective<00:03:16.750> the<00:03:17.200> whole<00:03:17.290> time<00:03:17.560> it's<00:03:18.160> kind

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
the objective the whole time it's kind

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:19.770 
the objective the whole time it's kind
of<00:03:18.340> like<00:03:18.430> a<00:03:18.490> small<00:03:18.970> little<00:03:19.000> mini<00:03:19.450> game<00:03:19.630> they

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
of like a small little mini game they

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:21.720 
of like a small little mini game they
put<00:03:19.960> inside<00:03:20.140> the<00:03:20.290> game<00:03:20.470> the<00:03:20.980> only<00:03:21.130> downside<00:03:21.370> to

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 
put inside the game the only downside to

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:23.340 
put inside the game the only downside to
this<00:03:21.850> is<00:03:22.090> if<00:03:22.300> you<00:03:22.540> watch<00:03:22.690> most<00:03:22.930> of<00:03:23.080> the<00:03:23.140> game

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:23.350 
this is if you watch most of the game

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:24.630 
this is if you watch most of the game
plays<00:03:23.560> that<00:03:23.740> people<00:03:23.980> do<00:03:24.100> when<00:03:24.280> they're<00:03:24.400> trying

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:24.640 
plays that people do when they're trying

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:26.310 
plays that people do when they're trying
to<00:03:24.760> get<00:03:24.910> headshots<00:03:25.090> kind<00:03:26.020> of<00:03:26.140> looks<00:03:26.260> like

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:26.320 
to get headshots kind of looks like

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:27.870 
to get headshots kind of looks like
they're<00:03:26.530> a<00:03:26.560> little<00:03:26.710> autistic<00:03:26.920> kid<00:03:27.430> run<00:03:27.640> around

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:27.880 
they're a little autistic kid run around

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:29.640 
they're a little autistic kid run around
shooting<00:03:27.970> for<00:03:28.300> people's<00:03:28.570> hair<00:03:28.810> it's<00:03:29.410> kind<00:03:29.530> of

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:29.650 
shooting for people's hair it's kind of

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:33.900 
shooting for people's hair it's kind of
funny<00:03:29.890> though<00:03:31.980> number<00:03:32.980> four<00:03:33.220> we<00:03:33.820> have

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:33.910 
funny though number four we have

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:36.300 
funny though number four we have
consistency<00:03:34.630> now<00:03:35.440> what<00:03:35.590> this<00:03:35.710> means<00:03:36.040> it's

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:36.310 
consistency now what this means it's

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:37.440 
consistency now what this means it's
pretty<00:03:36.580> much<00:03:36.700> you<00:03:36.820> guys<00:03:36.850> should<00:03:37.150> have<00:03:37.240> got

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.450 
pretty much you guys should have got

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:39.000 
pretty much you guys should have got
three<00:03:37.780> times<00:03:38.020> in<00:03:38.170> the<00:03:38.230> chest<00:03:38.260> and<00:03:38.650> you<00:03:38.770> get<00:03:38.920> the

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010 
three times in the chest and you get the

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:40.920 
three times in the chest and you get the
kill<00:03:39.220> next<00:03:40.090> time<00:03:40.240> you<00:03:40.330> should<00:03:40.360> have<00:03:40.600> got<00:03:40.720> three

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:40.930 
kill next time you should have got three

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:42.360 
kill next time you should have got three
times<00:03:41.140> and<00:03:41.290> chest<00:03:41.500> you<00:03:41.650> expect<00:03:42.040> to<00:03:42.160> kill

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.370 
times and chest you expect to kill

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:44.400 
times and chest you expect to kill
pretty<00:03:42.970> much<00:03:43.060> consistency<00:03:43.570> is<00:03:43.750> a<00:03:43.810> major<00:03:44.080> part

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:44.410 
pretty much consistency is a major part

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:46.020 
pretty much consistency is a major part
in<00:03:44.440> a<00:03:44.530> first-person<00:03:44.890> shooter<00:03:45.310> just<00:03:45.850> because

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 
in a first-person shooter just because

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:47.790 
in a first-person shooter just because
you're<00:03:46.150> expecting<00:03:46.720> stuff<00:03:47.050> to<00:03:47.200> happen<00:03:47.380> because

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:47.800 
you're expecting stuff to happen because

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:49.950 
you're expecting stuff to happen because
you<00:03:48.130> know<00:03:48.310> how<00:03:48.520> good<00:03:48.730> your<00:03:48.880> skill<00:03:49.150> is<00:03:49.330> then<00:03:49.870> you

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:49.960 
you know how good your skill is then you

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:52.380 
you know how good your skill is then you
expect<00:03:50.290> it<00:03:50.470> to<00:03:50.560> happen<00:03:50.710> pretty<00:03:51.640> much<00:03:51.790> with<00:03:51.910> mp7

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:52.390 
expect it to happen pretty much with mp7

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:54.060 
expect it to happen pretty much with mp7
and<00:03:52.690> Morrow<00:03:52.840> for<00:03:52.930> three<00:03:53.080> it<00:03:53.530> was<00:03:53.680> one<00:03:53.890> of<00:03:53.980> the

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:54.070 
and Morrow for three it was one of the

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:55.650 
and Morrow for three it was one of the
most<00:03:54.160> consistent<00:03:54.550> guns<00:03:54.940> in<00:03:55.090> the<00:03:55.150> game<00:03:55.360> that's

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:55.660 
most consistent guns in the game that's

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:57.720 
most consistent guns in the game that's
why<00:03:55.780> everyone<00:03:56.200> labeled<00:03:56.560> it<00:03:56.650> as<00:03:56.860> a<00:03:56.890> trihard<00:03:57.460> gun

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:57.730 
why everyone labeled it as a trihard gun

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:00.120 
why everyone labeled it as a trihard gun
and<00:03:57.970> now<00:03:58.570> the<00:03:58.630> mp7<00:03:58.930> and<00:03:59.260> black<00:03:59.410> ops<00:03:59.620> 2<00:03:59.830> is<00:04:00.070> uh

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:00.130 
and now the mp7 and black ops 2 is uh

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:03.030 
and now the mp7 and black ops 2 is uh
it's<00:04:00.850> it's<00:04:01.150> becoming<00:04:01.690> that<00:04:02.020> it's<00:04:02.380> a<00:04:02.740> very<00:04:02.950> good

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:03.040 
it's it's becoming that it's a very good

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.990 
it's it's becoming that it's a very good
gun<00:04:03.490> it's<00:04:04.120> just<00:04:04.300> a<00:04:04.390> little<00:04:04.570> inconsistent<00:04:05.080> and

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
gun it's just a little inconsistent and

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.150 
gun it's just a little inconsistent and
this<00:04:07.000> is<00:04:07.120> actually<00:04:07.270> why<00:04:08.170> I<00:04:08.200> believe<00:04:08.620> that<00:04:08.770> the

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:09.160 
this is actually why I believe that the

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.280 
this is actually why I believe that the
more<00:04:09.340> consistency<00:04:09.910> in<00:04:10.090> a<00:04:10.150> game<00:04:10.330> is<00:04:10.510> the<00:04:11.080> better

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:11.290 
more consistency in a game is the better

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:13.470 
more consistency in a game is the better
the<00:04:11.470> game<00:04:11.500> is<00:04:11.860> now<00:04:12.490> black<00:04:12.670> ops<00:04:12.880> 2<00:04:13.030> is<00:04:13.090> getting

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:13.480 
the game is now black ops 2 is getting

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:16.349 
the game is now black ops 2 is getting
that<00:04:13.630> it<00:04:14.620> takes<00:04:14.800> time<00:04:15.100> but<00:04:15.700> they<00:04:15.940> they're

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:16.359 
that it takes time but they they're

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:18.479 
that it takes time but they they're
slowly<00:04:16.780> getting<00:04:17.230> the<00:04:17.560> consistency<00:04:18.220> and<00:04:18.400> I

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:18.489 
slowly getting the consistency and I

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:20.510 
slowly getting the consistency and I
makes<00:04:19.090> it<00:04:19.209> a<00:04:19.270> lot<00:04:19.359> more<00:04:19.420> enjoyable<00:04:19.840> game

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:20.520 
makes it a lot more enjoyable game

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:23.219 
makes it a lot more enjoyable game
number<00:04:21.520> five<00:04:21.760> the<00:04:22.270> one<00:04:22.450> thing<00:04:22.630> that<00:04:22.690> black<00:04:23.020> ops

00:04:23.219 --> 00:04:23.229 
number five the one thing that black ops

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:24.420 
number five the one thing that black ops
2<00:04:23.410> is<00:04:23.530> actually<00:04:23.830> brought<00:04:24.040> to<00:04:24.160> the<00:04:24.250> table

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:24.430 
2 is actually brought to the table

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:26.580 
2 is actually brought to the table
that's<00:04:24.760> actually<00:04:25.180> beats<00:04:25.630> all<00:04:25.930> the<00:04:26.080> other<00:04:26.200> call

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:26.590 
that's actually beats all the other call
