public<00:02:09.869> I<00:02:10.350> think<00:02:10.769> the<00:02:10.860> art<00:02:11.070> should<00:02:11.400> have<00:02:11.640> a

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
public I think the art should have a

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.850 
public I think the art should have a
place<00:02:11.970> it's<00:02:12.510> more<00:02:12.780> important<00:02:13.320> than<00:02:13.350> Hollywood

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
place it's more important than Hollywood

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.130 
place it's more important than Hollywood
and<00:02:14.100> politics<00:02:14.549> I<00:02:14.790> think<00:02:15.209> that<00:02:15.390> is<00:02:15.510> it<00:02:15.780> can

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
and politics I think that is it can

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.440 
and politics I think that is it can
really<00:02:16.350> change<00:02:16.680> people's<00:02:17.160> lives<00:02:17.250> and<00:02:17.880> i<00:02:18.239> want

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
to change people's lives through my art

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.220 
to change people's lives through my art
how<00:02:20.880> it<00:02:20.940> should<00:02:21.180> be<00:02:21.209> everywhere<00:02:21.660> art<00:02:21.930> is

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
how it should be everywhere art is

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:34.050 
how it should be everywhere art is
everywhere<00:02:22.410> anyway
