00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.219 
like that and a tab like that okay then
let's<00:01:53.189> take<00:01:53.340> a<00:01:53.670> front<00:01:54.270> picture<00:01:54.659> of<00:01:54.780> the<00:01:54.899> vacuum

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
let's take a front picture of the vacuum

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:56.870 
let's take a front picture of the vacuum
clean<00:01:55.409> this<00:01:55.590> is<00:01:55.770> a<00:01:55.799> singer<00:01:56.219> vacuum<00:01:56.640> cleaner

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
clean this is a singer vacuum cleaner

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.940 
clean this is a singer vacuum cleaner
also<00:01:57.149> power<00:01:57.689> flight<00:01:58.079> made<00:01:58.350> a<00:01:58.380> vacuum<00:01:58.829> cleaner

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
also power flight made a vacuum cleaner

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.819 
also power flight made a vacuum cleaner
just<00:01:59.430> like<00:01:59.640> this<00:01:59.880> that<00:02:00.119> was<00:02:00.329> blue<00:02:00.689> and<00:02:01.049> had<00:02:01.799> a

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
just like this that was blue and had a

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.410 
just like this that was blue and had a
little<00:02:02.130> bit<00:02:02.250> longer<00:02:02.490> of<00:02:02.640> the<00:02:02.850> cord<00:02:03.149> but<00:02:03.270> the

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
little bit longer of the cord but the

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.690 
little bit longer of the cord but the
parts<00:02:03.689> are<00:02:03.810> interchangeable<00:02:04.340> now<00:02:05.340> on<00:02:05.549> the

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
parts are interchangeable now on the

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.600 
parts are interchangeable now on the
belt<00:02:05.909> change<00:02:06.240> on<00:02:06.479> these<00:02:06.689> guys<00:02:06.960> here<00:02:07.320> yo<00:02:07.920> you'll

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
belt change on these guys here yo you'll

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.360 
belt change on these guys here yo you'll
will<00:02:08.910> find<00:02:09.149> it<00:02:09.300> very<00:02:09.330> difficult<00:02:09.989> to<00:02:10.590> get<00:02:11.099> the

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
will find it very difficult to get the

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.180 
will find it very difficult to get the
exact<00:02:11.970> bags<00:02:12.569> that

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
exact bags that

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.700 
exact bags that
we'll<00:02:13.280> fit<00:02:13.490> this<00:02:13.730> machine<00:02:14.240> so<00:02:15.080> what<00:02:15.350> you<00:02:15.470> could

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:15.710 
we'll fit this machine so what you could

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:18.240 
we'll fit this machine so what you could
do<00:02:15.950> is<00:02:16.220> if<00:02:16.790> you<00:02:16.970> need<00:02:17.120> backs<00:02:17.390> for<00:02:17.660> this<00:02:17.840> machine

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
do is if you need backs for this machine

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:21.790 
do is if you need backs for this machine
take<00:02:19.250> a<00:02:19.280> picture<00:02:19.700> of<00:02:19.730> this<00:02:19.940> eureka<00:02:20.750> F&amp;G<00:02:21.530> bags
