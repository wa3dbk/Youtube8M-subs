this area once looking for it and the
second<00:00:42.360> time<00:00:42.480> was<00:00:42.540> just<00:00:42.960> kind<00:00:43.140> of<00:00:43.280> by

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
second time was just kind of by

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.670 
second time was just kind of by
happenstance<00:00:45.120> so<00:00:45.629> this<00:00:46.140> is<00:00:46.260> actually<00:00:46.410> the

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
happenstance so this is actually the

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.940 
happenstance so this is actually the
second<00:00:47.070> time<00:00:47.250> I<00:00:48.350> just<00:00:49.350> happen<00:00:49.649> to<00:00:49.680> see<00:00:49.800> the

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.900 
second time I just happen to see the
guys<00:00:50.100> spawn<00:00:50.430> so<00:00:51.090> Luca<00:00:52.370> might<00:00:53.370> as<00:00:53.460> well<00:00:53.489> go<00:00:53.699> for

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
guys spawn so Luca might as well go for

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.689 
guys spawn so Luca might as well go for
it<00:00:54.030> again<00:00:54.059> might<00:00:54.420> as<00:00:54.510> well<00:00:54.629> kill<00:00:54.809> him<00:00:54.960> again<00:00:55.699> so

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
it again might as well kill him again so

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.639 
it again might as well kill him again so
anyways<00:00:56.969> is<00:00:57.149> this<00:00:57.690> is<00:00:57.809> my<00:00:57.930> second<00:00:58.289> attempt

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
here and I'm basically just starting the

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.429 
here and I'm basically just starting the
event<00:01:02.190> you<00:01:02.570> start<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:03.690> event<00:01:03.930> by<00:01:04.049> killing

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
event you start the event by killing

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.050 
event you start the event by killing
these<00:01:04.559> guys<00:01:04.799> with<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.189> Rockets<00:01:05.640> you<00:01:05.790> pick<00:01:05.939> up

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
these guys with the Rockets you pick up

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.780 
these guys with the Rockets you pick up
their<00:01:06.210> rockets<00:01:06.689> and<00:01:07.130> you<00:01:08.130> start<00:01:08.369> seeing<00:01:08.580> a

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
their rockets and you start seeing a

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.550 
their rockets and you start seeing a
series<00:01:09.090> of<00:01:09.150> ships<00:01:09.479> coming<00:01:09.750> in<00:01:09.960> and<00:01:10.229> then

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
series of ships coming in and then

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.050 
series of ships coming in and then
you'll<00:01:10.740> just<00:01:10.950> basically<00:01:11.310> kill<00:01:11.610> all<00:01:11.760> the<00:01:11.880> waves

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
you'll just basically kill all the waves

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.179 
you'll just basically kill all the waves
of<00:01:12.240> enemies<00:01:12.630> so<00:01:12.900> it's<00:01:13.380> not<00:01:13.590> terribly<00:01:13.979> it<00:01:14.159> a

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
of enemies so it's not terribly it a

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.039 
of enemies so it's not terribly it a
little<00:01:14.369> difficult<00:01:14.850> this<00:01:15.630> one<00:01:15.810> I<00:01:15.840> would

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
little difficult this one I would

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.170 
little difficult this one I would
probably<00:01:16.229> say<00:01:16.500> is<00:01:16.860> the<00:01:17.070> second<00:01:17.640> most

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
probably say is the second most

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.240 
probably say is the second most
difficult<00:01:18.689> guy<00:01:18.900> of<00:01:19.680> the<00:01:19.830> three<00:01:20.040> that<00:01:20.159> I've

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250

the chest but I didn't know where this

00:02:55.879 --> 00:02:58.240 
the chest but I didn't know where this
with<00:02:56.120> Jess<00:02:56.480> location<00:02:57.169> was<00:02:57.349> so<00:02:57.650> I<00:02:57.829> know<00:02:58.129> that

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250

with Jess location was so I know that
there's<00:02:58.579> one<00:02:58.790> up<00:02:59.030> on<00:02:59.150> this<00:02:59.329> cliff<00:02:59.629> or<00:02:59.959> up<00:03:00.079> on

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
there's one up on this cliff or up on

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:03.099 
there's one up on this cliff or up on
one<00:03:00.409> of<00:03:00.500> those<00:03:00.590> pillars<00:03:00.980> right<00:03:01.189> there<00:03:01.959> but<00:03:02.959> I<00:03:02.989> I

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:03.109 
one of those pillars right there but I I

00:03:03.109 --> 00:03:05.800 
one of those pillars right there but I I
wasn't<00:03:03.859> sure<00:03:04.220> exactly<00:03:04.760> where<00:03:05.299> this<00:03:05.450> one<00:03:05.659> would

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
wasn't sure exactly where this one would

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:08.229 
wasn't sure exactly where this one would
be<00:03:05.840> so<00:03:06.230> there's<00:03:06.769> like<00:03:06.950> three<00:03:07.489> in<00:03:07.700> this<00:03:07.849> area

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:08.239 
be so there's like three in this area

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:11.949 
be so there's like three in this area
right<00:03:08.419> here<00:03:10.150> two<00:03:11.150> were<00:03:11.269> probably<00:03:11.629> two<00:03:11.930> or

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:11.959 
right here two were probably two or

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:15.309 
right here two were probably two or
three<00:03:12.400> but<00:03:13.400> I<00:03:13.790> couldn't<00:03:14.689> for<00:03:14.870> the<00:03:14.959> life<00:03:14.989> of<00:03:15.260> me

00:03:15.309 --> 00:03:15.319 
three but I couldn't for the life of me

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:18.159 
three but I couldn't for the life of me
find<00:03:15.620> it<00:03:15.829> for<00:03:16.010> I<00:03:16.730> don't<00:03:17.419> know<00:03:17.540> probably<00:03:17.780> 45

00:03:18.159 --> 00:03:18.169 
find it for I don't know probably 45

00:03:18.169 --> 00:03:20.559 
find it for I don't know probably 45
seconds<00:03:18.859> but<00:03:19.069> it<00:03:19.579> ended<00:03:19.790> up<00:03:19.879> being<00:03:20.090> up<00:03:20.299> on<00:03:20.449> this

00:03:20.559 --> 00:03:20.569 
seconds but it ended up being up on this

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:21.759 
seconds but it ended up being up on this
cliff<00:03:20.870> so<00:03:21.079> make<00:03:21.229> sure<00:03:21.260> you're<00:03:21.500> looking

00:03:21.759 --> 00:03:21.769 
cliff so make sure you're looking

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:23.140 
cliff so make sure you're looking
everywhere<00:03:22.040> make<00:03:22.430> sure<00:03:22.579> you're<00:03:22.729> finding

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.150 
everywhere make sure you're finding

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:25.000 
everywhere make sure you're finding
these<00:03:23.329> treasure<00:03:23.659> chest<00:03:23.989> I'll<00:03:24.440> probably<00:03:24.709> do<00:03:24.979> a

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010 
these treasure chest I'll probably do a

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:27.129 
these treasure chest I'll probably do a
video<00:03:25.280> later<00:03:25.609> on<00:03:25.879> with<00:03:26.090> all<00:03:26.269> the<00:03:26.419> locations<00:03:26.750> of

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:27.139 
video later on with all the locations of

00:03:27.139 --> 00:03:30.129 
video later on with all the locations of
the<00:03:27.500> chest<00:03:27.799> just<00:03:28.129> a<00:03:28.909> compilation<00:03:29.120> of<00:03:29.659> all<00:03:29.900> the

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:30.139 
the chest just a compilation of all the

different<00:03:30.500> locations<00:03:30.949> and<00:03:31.069> stuff<00:03:31.370> but<00:03:33.069> if<00:03:34.069> you

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:34.250 
different locations and stuff but if you

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:37.270 
different locations and stuff but if you
see<00:03:34.489> if<00:03:34.729> you<00:03:34.940> can<00:03:35.120> look<00:03:35.239> up<00:03:35.419> into<00:03:35.720> the<00:03:35.840> right<00:03:36.280> it

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:37.280 
see if you can look up into the right it

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:39.069 
see if you can look up into the right it
doesn't<00:03:37.549> look<00:03:37.609> like<00:03:37.669> you<00:03:37.909> can<00:03:38.030> see<00:03:38.269> it<00:03:38.359> yet<00:03:38.690> but

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:39.079 
doesn't look like you can see it yet but
