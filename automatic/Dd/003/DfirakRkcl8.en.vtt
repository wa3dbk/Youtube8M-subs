 this is six pencils 9 squares in 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:37.079
 each and 43 20 billion combinations 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.620
 possible 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:47.190
 only one is the right that makes each color 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:50.219
 its place is to anyway to 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:53.190
 as a pyramid that the staff competes in 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:57.510

00:00:53.190 --> 00:01:03.809
 only one injured hand complements 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:06.739

 people will finish two layers of the cube 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:37.170
 even layers sales from down to globalia 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:40.260
 the next step is to put the yellows in the 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:43.500
 top in the mayan at the top and then I look 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:48.240
 combination that is being analyzed 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:49.980
 neither easy nor easy for him that already
