secrets that'll make it go a lot easier
the<00:00:28.070> most<00:00:28.340> common<00:00:28.970> use<00:00:29.570> of<00:00:29.599> crown<00:00:30.230> molding<00:00:30.259> is

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:30.949 
the most common use of crown molding is

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:33.730 
the most common use of crown molding is
to<00:00:31.099> provide<00:00:31.429> a<00:00:31.460> visual<00:00:31.820> break<00:00:32.540> or<00:00:32.960> transition

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:33.740 
to provide a visual break or transition

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:36.790 
to provide a visual break or transition
between<00:00:33.980> the<00:00:34.460> wall<00:00:34.820> and<00:00:35.050> the<00:00:36.050> ceiling<00:00:36.320> it

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:36.800 
between the wall and the ceiling it

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.310 
between the wall and the ceiling it
comes<00:00:37.190> in<00:00:37.400> three<00:00:37.820> angles<00:00:38.450> the<00:00:38.660> most<00:00:38.870> common

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:39.320 
comes in three angles the most common

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.610 
comes in three angles the most common
being<00:00:39.610> 45<00:00:40.610> degrees<00:00:41.270> such<00:00:41.719> as<00:00:41.899> in<00:00:42.079> this<00:00:42.200> walnut

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:42.620 
being 45 degrees such as in this walnut

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:46.720 
being 45 degrees such as in this walnut
piece<00:00:43.070> right<00:00:43.340> here<00:00:43.399> the<00:00:44.329> other<00:00:44.539> one<00:00:44.809> is<00:00:45.730> 38

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:46.730 
piece right here the other one is 38

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:51.250 
piece right here the other one is 38
degrees<00:00:46.899> and<00:00:48.160> the<00:00:49.160> complement<00:00:49.789> of<00:00:49.879> that<00:00:50.510> angle

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:51.260 
degrees and the complement of that angle

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.650 
degrees and the complement of that angle
which<00:00:51.500> would<00:00:51.710> be<00:00:51.859> 52<00:00:52.520> degrees<00:00:52.969> and<00:00:53.270> would<00:00:53.449> give

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:53.660 
which would be 52 degrees and would give

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:56.770 
which would be 52 degrees and would give
a<00:00:53.690> a<00:00:54.050> gentler<00:00:54.949> break<00:00:55.460> to<00:00:55.879> the<00:00:55.910> ceiling<00:00:56.449> you<00:00:56.750> can

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:56.780 
a a gentler break to the ceiling you can

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:58.840 
a a gentler break to the ceiling you can
generally<00:00:57.379> tell<00:00:57.590> the<00:00:57.769> bottom<00:00:58.190> from<00:00:58.460> the<00:00:58.579> top

00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:58.850 
generally tell the bottom from the top

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.029 
generally tell the bottom from the top
and<00:00:59.149> that<00:00:59.300> the<00:00:59.449> bottom<00:00:59.629> almost<00:01:00.019> always<00:01:00.500> has<00:01:00.739> a

00:01:01.029 --> 00:01:01.039 
and that the bottom almost always has a

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:04.960 
and that the bottom almost always has a
cold<00:01:01.399> molding<00:01:01.969> running<00:01:02.359> along<00:01:03.610> we<00:01:04.610> have<00:01:04.790> to

a<00:02:22.610> 38<00:02:22.970> degree<00:02:23.380> molding<00:02:24.380> so<00:02:24.650> it<00:02:25.040> covers<00:02:25.400> the<00:02:25.850> the

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:25.880 
a 38 degree molding so it covers the the

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.690 
a 38 degree molding so it covers the the
waterfront<00:02:26.750> and<00:02:26.930> you<00:02:27.380> simply<00:02:27.800> put<00:02:28.430> that

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
waterfront and you simply put that

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.420 
waterfront and you simply put that
molding<00:02:29.090> in<00:02:29.270> there<00:02:29.540> and<00:02:30.410> make<00:02:30.740> the<00:02:30.920> cuts<00:02:31.190> as

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
molding in there and make the cuts as

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.200 
molding in there and make the cuts as
normal<00:02:32.150> miter<00:02:32.600> cuts<00:02:33.050> all<00:02:33.620> left<00:02:34.610> hand<00:02:34.940> pieces

there or lack thereof it's simply to put

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:52.630 
there or lack thereof it's simply to put
a<00:02:49.640> level<00:02:50.060> on<00:02:50.330> this<00:02:50.750> part<00:02:51.230> and<00:02:51.590> as<00:02:52.070> long<00:02:52.280> as<00:02:52.490> the

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 
a level on this part and as long as the

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.120 
a level on this part and as long as the
solace<00:02:53.210> level<00:02:53.600> this<00:02:54.110> little<00:02:54.530> ledge<00:02:54.740> here

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.130 
solace level this little ledge here

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:58.300 
solace level this little ledge here
should<00:02:55.610> also<00:02:55.790> be<00:02:56.240> level<00:02:56.630> like<00:02:57.200> so<00:02:57.470> the<00:02:58.280> first

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 
should also be level like so the first

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:00.880 
should also be level like so the first
thing<00:02:58.790> I've<00:02:58.970> done<00:02:59.390> here<00:02:59.960> I<00:02:59.990> want<00:03:00.110> to<00:03:00.410> cover<00:03:00.710> my

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
thing I've done here I want to cover my

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:02.050 
thing I've done here I want to cover my
dovetails

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
dovetails

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.590 
dovetails
so<00:03:02.540> I've<00:03:02.840> scribed<00:03:03.350> a<00:03:03.650> belt<00:03:04.160> line<00:03:04.460> all<00:03:05.120> the<00:03:05.570> way

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:05.600 
so I've scribed a belt line all the way

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:08.760 
so I've scribed a belt line all the way
around<00:03:06.080> this<00:03:06.290> cabinet<00:03:06.920> that<00:03:07.760> is<00:03:07.910> level<00:03:08.240> and

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:08.770 
around this cabinet that is level and

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:12.730 
around this cabinet that is level and
covers<00:03:09.770> the<00:03:09.980> dovetails<00:03:10.460> the<00:03:11.330> next<00:03:12.320> thing<00:03:12.530> I<00:03:12.680> do

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:12.740 
covers the dovetails the next thing I do

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:15.880 
covers the dovetails the next thing I do
is<00:03:12.920> take<00:03:13.430> a<00:03:13.700> protractor<00:03:14.630> and<00:03:15.470> I<00:03:15.680> actually

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:15.890 
is take a protractor and I actually

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:18.490 
is take a protractor and I actually
measure<00:03:16.520> this<00:03:16.940> corner<00:03:17.450> better<00:03:17.930> to<00:03:18.140> be<00:03:18.260> lucky

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500 
measure this corner better to be lucky

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.060 
measure this corner better to be lucky
than<00:03:18.710> good<00:03:19.090> I'm<00:03:20.090> exactly<00:03:20.990> ninety<00:03:21.620> degrees<00:03:22.040> so

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:22.070 
than good I'm exactly ninety degrees so

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:25.900 
than good I'm exactly ninety degrees so
half<00:03:22.730> of<00:03:22.910> that<00:03:22.970> is<00:03:23.300> 45<00:03:24.170> if<00:03:24.800> I<00:03:25.400> had<00:03:25.580> something

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:25.910 
half of that is 45 if I had something

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:28.690 
half of that is 45 if I had something
other<00:03:26.270> ninety<00:03:27.140> I<00:03:27.170> would<00:03:27.560> divide<00:03:28.370> that

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700 
other ninety I would divide that

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:31.480 
other ninety I would divide that
measurement<00:03:29.540> in<00:03:29.750> two<00:03:30.080> and<00:03:30.440> that<00:03:31.040> is<00:03:31.220> what<00:03:31.460> I

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:31.490 
measurement in two and that is what I

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:34.390 
measurement in two and that is what I
would<00:03:31.790> set<00:03:32.060> my<00:03:32.270> chop<00:03:32.570> saw<00:03:32.600> to

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:34.400 
would set my chop saw to

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:38.229 
would set my chop saw to
by<00:03:35.030> placing<00:03:35.480> my<00:03:35.930> jig<00:03:36.349> right<00:03:37.190> flush<00:03:37.640> like<00:03:37.940> this

00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:38.239 
by placing my jig right flush like this

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:42.420 
by placing my jig right flush like this
with<00:03:38.569> the<00:03:38.720> edge<00:03:39.489> of<00:03:40.489> the<00:03:41.390> chip<00:03:41.599> guard<00:03:41.900> and

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:42.430 
with the edge of the chip guard and

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:44.920 
with the edge of the chip guard and
making<00:03:43.430> it<00:03:43.549> a<00:03:43.580> little<00:03:43.790> line<00:03:44.000> so<00:03:44.420> I<00:03:44.450> could<00:03:44.750> right

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:44.930 
making it a little line so I could right

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:46.899 
making it a little line so I could right
there<00:03:45.200> on<00:03:45.409> my<00:03:45.440> fence<00:03:45.950> so<00:03:46.159> I<00:03:46.220> can<00:03:46.400> put<00:03:46.610> it<00:03:46.730> back

00:03:46.899 --> 00:03:46.909 
there on my fence so I can put it back

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:49.420 
there on my fence so I can put it back
there<00:03:47.150> each<00:03:47.450> time<00:03:47.480> I<00:03:48.110> have<00:03:48.980> determined

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.430 
there each time I have determined

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:53.229 
there each time I have determined
through<00:03:49.760> a<00:03:49.879> trial<00:03:50.269> cut<00:03:50.590> that<00:03:51.760> this<00:03:52.760> will<00:03:53.000> cut

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:53.239 
through a trial cut that this will cut

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:56.440 
through a trial cut that this will cut
about<00:03:53.480> an<00:03:53.659> inch<00:03:53.900> and<00:03:54.290> 3/16<00:03:55.250> from<00:03:55.489> the<00:03:55.670> end<00:03:55.970> of

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:56.450 
about an inch and 3/16 from the end of

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:59.289 
about an inch and 3/16 from the end of
the<00:03:56.510> jig<00:03:56.840> so<00:03:57.560> when<00:03:57.799> I<00:03:57.829> put<00:03:58.190> this<00:03:58.220> in<00:03:58.579> here<00:03:58.610> all<00:03:59.239> I

00:03:59.289 --> 00:03:59.299 
the jig so when I put this in here all I

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:02.559 
the jig so when I put this in here all I
had<00:03:59.810> to<00:03:59.930> do<00:04:00.140> is<00:04:00.349> line<00:04:00.950> up<00:04:00.980> my<00:04:01.400> line<00:04:01.790> down<00:04:02.239> here
