your watch battery or even less but it's
just<00:00:46.590> enough<00:00:46.890> to<00:00:47.100> stimulate<00:00:47.550> the<00:00:47.700> plant<00:00:48.000> to

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
just enough to stimulate the plant to

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.900 
just enough to stimulate the plant to
absorb<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:49.079> nutrients<00:00:49.559> for<00:00:50.460> me<00:00:50.579> the<00:00:50.730> journey

started<00:00:51.329> back<00:00:51.510> in<00:00:51.690> junior<00:00:51.899> high<00:00:52.110> school<00:00:52.170> where

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
started back in junior high school where

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.709 
started back in junior high school where
I<00:00:52.890> did<00:00:53.129> this<00:00:53.309> as<00:00:53.460> a<00:00:53.489> science<00:00:53.910> fair<00:00:54.059> project<00:00:54.120> and

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
I did this as a science fair project and

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.540 
I did this as a science fair project and
actually<00:00:54.870> took<00:00:55.260> first<00:00:55.620> place<00:00:55.800> at<00:00:55.920> state<00:00:56.340> two

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
actually took first place at state two

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.939 
actually took first place at state two
years<00:00:56.789> in<00:00:56.940> a<00:00:57.030> row<00:00:57.180> so<00:00:58.140> here<00:00:58.289> you<00:00:58.440> can<00:00:58.530> see<00:00:58.739> one

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
years in a row so here you can see one

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.099 
years in a row so here you can see one
plant<00:00:59.280> had<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.670> AG<00:00:59.820> revolt<00:01:00.149> one<00:01:00.390> plant<00:01:00.719> dented

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
plant had the AG revolt one plant dented

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.810 
plant had the AG revolt one plant dented
it's<00:01:01.289> pretty<00:01:01.530> obvious<00:01:01.920> which<00:01:02.100> one<00:01:02.160> had<00:01:02.609> it

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
it's pretty obvious which one had it

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.729 
it's pretty obvious which one had it
these<00:01:03.719> are<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:03.930> kind<00:01:04.170> of<00:01:04.229> results<00:01:04.379> that<00:01:04.650> we

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
these are the kind of results that we

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.260 
these are the kind of results that we
would<00:01:04.949> expect<00:01:05.250> you<00:01:05.430> to<00:01:05.460> find<00:01:05.790> at<00:01:05.939> home<00:01:05.970> with

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
at the University of Florida who was

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.060 
at the University of Florida who was
very<00:01:12.240> interested<00:01:12.510> in<00:01:12.930> this<00:01:13.080> and<00:01:13.380> decided<00:01:14.010> to

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
very interested in this and decided to

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.700 
very interested in this and decided to
do<00:01:14.189> a<00:01:14.220> six-month<00:01:14.580> research<00:01:15.060> project<00:01:15.570> we<00:01:16.530> grew

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
do a six-month research project we grew

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.600 
do a six-month research project we grew
tomatoes<00:01:16.970> lettuce<00:01:17.970> beans<00:01:18.659> and<00:01:19.259> celery<00:01:20.040> and<00:01:20.460> we

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
tomatoes lettuce beans and celery and we

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.160 
tomatoes lettuce beans and celery and we
had<00:01:20.790> increased<00:01:21.270> growth<00:01:21.540> anywhere<00:01:21.960> from

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
had increased growth anywhere from

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.050 
had increased growth anywhere from
thirty<00:01:22.500> to<00:01:22.619> seventy<00:01:22.979> percent<00:01:23.189> in<00:01:23.610> both<00:01:23.759> fresh

thirty to seventy percent in both fresh

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.780 
thirty to seventy percent in both fresh
and<00:01:24.090> dry<00:01:24.570> weight<00:01:24.890> so<00:01:25.890> an<00:01:26.009> added<00:01:26.280> bonus<00:01:26.430> that<00:01:26.670> we

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
and dry weight so an added bonus that we

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.130 
and dry weight so an added bonus that we
discovered<00:01:27.299> at<00:01:27.390> the<00:01:27.479> University<00:01:27.930> of<00:01:27.960> Florida

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.050 
discovered at the University of Florida
was<00:01:28.500> that<00:01:28.680> it<00:01:28.799> did<00:01:29.009> decrease<00:01:29.490> insect

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
was that it did decrease insect

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.120 
was that it did decrease insect
