beginning<00:00:47.520> in<00:00:47.910> my<00:00:48.030> childhood<00:00:48.660> for<00:00:48.989> me<00:00:49.170> it<00:00:49.320> was

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
beginning in my childhood for me it was

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.490 
beginning in my childhood for me it was
two<00:00:49.620> weeks<00:00:49.770> after<00:00:50.070> I<00:00:50.399> graduated<00:00:50.940> from<00:00:51.149> college

two weeks after I graduated from college
it<00:00:52.500> was<00:00:52.680> then<00:00:52.980> that<00:00:53.309> I<00:00:53.850> ended<00:00:54.090> up<00:00:54.180> with<00:00:54.270> my

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
it was then that I ended up with my

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.709 
it was then that I ended up with my
first<00:00:54.629> turtle<00:00:55.110> almost<00:00:55.590> out<00:00:55.890> of<00:00:55.920> happenstance

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
and tortoises I think it's pretty simple

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.950

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
day one step at a time that's probably

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.230 
day one step at a time that's probably
one<00:01:20.310> of<00:01:20.340> the<00:01:20.460> reasons<00:01:20.549> why<00:01:20.850> they're<00:01:21.060> still

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
one of the reasons why they're still

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.179

around<00:01:21.390> why<00:01:21.810> they've<00:01:21.990> been<00:01:22.110> around<00:01:22.320> so<00:01:22.590> long<00:01:22.619> I

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
around why they've been around so long I

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:24.530 
around why they've been around so long I
think<00:01:23.640> it's<00:01:23.759> something<00:01:23.970> we<00:01:24.119> could<00:01:24.299> all<00:01:24.390> learn

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
think it's something we could all learn

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.520 
think it's something we could all learn
from<00:01:24.680> at<00:01:25.680> age<00:01:25.890> 9<00:01:26.509> on<00:01:27.509> a<00:01:27.570> visit<00:01:27.930> to<00:01:27.960> the<00:01:28.200> Bronx
