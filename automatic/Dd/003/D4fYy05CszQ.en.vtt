00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
puts a huge emphasis when it comes to

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.650 
puts a huge emphasis when it comes to
awards<00:02:26.190> like<00:02:26.340> the<00:02:26.520> MVP<00:02:27.090> and<00:02:27.270> Rookie<00:02:27.300> of<00:02:27.600> the

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
Year it has mostly to do with the number

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.310 
Year it has mostly to do with the number
of<00:02:31.530> home<00:02:31.709> runs<00:02:31.739> you<00:02:32.040> hit<00:02:32.280> now<00:02:32.910> while<00:02:33.180> I<00:02:33.570> might

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
of home runs you hit now while I might

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:38.060 
of home runs you hit now while I might

really<00:02:38.400> no<00:02:38.670> way<00:02:38.850> that<00:02:39.060> I<00:02:39.090> can<00:02:39.209> catch<00:02:39.600> up<00:02:39.840> in<00:02:40.050> it

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
Rookie of the Year race so I'd hate to

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
really have a fair shake at it but you

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.160 
really have a fair shake at it but you
know<00:02:52.500> what<00:02:52.830> that's<00:02:53.790> just<00:02:54.030> a<00:02:54.299> small<00:02:54.630> goal<00:02:54.989> that

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
know what that's just a small goal that

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:00.199 
know what that's just a small goal that
I'd<00:02:55.260> like<00:02:55.440> to<00:02:55.620> hit<00:02:56.900> the<00:02:57.900> main<00:02:58.140> ones<00:02:58.410> though<00:02:59.209> get

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
I'd like to hit the main ones though get

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:02.830 
I'd like to hit the main ones though get
the<00:03:00.360> MVP<00:03:00.590> someday<00:03:01.590> win<00:03:02.310> a<00:03:02.340> World<00:03:02.640> Championship

robbed of a hit by the picture

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:17.569 
robbed of a hit by the picture
and<00:03:14.519> now<00:03:14.790> that<00:03:15.060> the<00:03:15.180> focus<00:03:15.510> has<00:03:16.260> changed<00:03:16.579> to

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:17.579 
and now that the focus has changed to

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:20.199 
and now that the focus has changed to
simply<00:03:18.480> showing<00:03:18.780> up<00:03:19.049> and<00:03:19.260> playing<00:03:19.560> every<00:03:19.859> day

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:20.209 
simply showing up and playing every day

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:23.390 
simply showing up and playing every day
I've<00:03:21.209> got<00:03:21.510> to<00:03:21.540> do<00:03:21.780> my<00:03:21.810> best<00:03:22.290> to<00:03:22.620> make<00:03:22.680> sure<00:03:23.099> that

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
I've got to do my best to make sure that

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.059 
I've got to do my best to make sure that
I'm<00:03:23.579> fulfilling<00:03:24.090> my<00:03:24.450> role<00:03:24.900> at<00:03:25.049> this<00:03:25.230> point<00:03:25.620> I'm

00:03:26.059 --> 00:03:26.069 
I'm fulfilling my role at this point I'm

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:29.300 
I'm fulfilling my role at this point I'm
starting<00:03:26.370> to<00:03:26.639> notice<00:03:27.409> that<00:03:28.409> my<00:03:28.590> solid<00:03:29.040> hits

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
starting to notice that my solid hits

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:30.770 
starting to notice that my solid hits
they're<00:03:29.519> not<00:03:29.670> quite<00:03:29.819> traveling<00:03:30.420> this<00:03:30.480> far<00:03:30.540> and

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
they're not quite traveling this far and

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.229 
they're not quite traveling this far and
I<00:03:30.840> think<00:03:31.170> that's<00:03:31.379> got<00:03:31.620> a<00:03:31.650> lot<00:03:31.950> to<00:03:32.159> do<00:03:32.340> with<00:03:32.579> the

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239 
I think that's got a lot to do with the

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:37.660 
I think that's got a lot to do with the
better<00:03:33.480> pitching<00:03:34.079> you<00:03:34.739> see<00:03:35.209> your<00:03:36.209> player

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:37.670 
better pitching you see your player

big<00:03:54.120> impact<00:03:54.389> as<00:03:54.870> well<00:03:55.139> so<00:03:55.799> I've<00:03:55.949> got<00:03:56.159> to

00:03:56.179 --> 00:03:56.189 
big impact as well so I've got to

00:03:56.189 --> 00:03:59.360 
big impact as well so I've got to
overcome<00:03:56.819> that<00:03:57.060> by<00:03:57.359> increasing<00:03:58.019> my<00:03:58.620> skills<00:03:59.129> at

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
overcome that by increasing my skills at

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:02.869 
overcome that by increasing my skills at
the<00:03:59.459> plate<00:04:00.409> second<00:04:01.409> and<00:04:02.189> this<00:04:02.489> is<00:04:02.669> going<00:04:02.790> to

00:04:02.869 --> 00:04:02.879 
the plate second and this is going to

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:04.819 
the plate second and this is going to
get<00:04:02.969> down<00:04:03.180> for<00:04:03.419> extra<00:04:03.750> bases<00:04:03.870> is<00:04:04.379> that'll<00:04:04.709> get

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:04.829 
get down for extra bases is that'll get

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:08.170 
get down for extra bases is that'll get
one<00:04:05.129> if<00:04:05.370> not<00:04:05.519> both<00:04:05.579> of<00:04:05.849> the<00:04:06.090> boys<00:04:06.299> and<00:04:07.139> the<00:04:07.169> run
