but now three is really nice actually
but<00:01:42.119> if<00:01:42.270> you<00:01:42.329> guys<00:01:42.420> are<00:01:42.570> playing<00:01:42.720> on<00:01:42.840> four<00:01:43.140> and

but if you guys are playing on four and

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.660

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
it's eating a little bit too fast and

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.010 
it's eating a little bit too fast and
you<00:01:44.729> don't<00:01:45.360> want<00:01:45.479> to<00:01:45.540> go<00:01:45.600> down<00:01:45.689> to<00:01:45.750> three

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
you don't want to go down to three

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.389 
you don't want to go down to three
because<00:01:46.200> you<00:01:46.259> feel<00:01:46.409> like<00:01:46.439> it's<00:01:46.619> too<00:01:46.740> slow<00:01:46.979> go

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
because you feel like it's too slow go

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.580 
because you feel like it's too slow go

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
down to 33 feels really good like my

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:50.990 
down to 33 feels really good like my
shot<00:01:49.860> is<00:01:49.890> a<00:01:50.070> lot<00:01:50.310> better<00:01:50.460> now<00:01:50.670> with<00:01:50.700> three

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
shot is a lot better now with three

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.090 
shot is a lot better now with three
because<00:01:51.509> especially<00:01:51.720> here<00:01:52.020> in<00:01:52.079> midair<00:01:52.320> trying

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
because especially here in midair trying

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.530 
because especially here in midair trying
to<00:01:53.159> like<00:01:53.280> kill<00:01:53.430> us<00:01:53.490> when<00:01:53.579> you're<00:01:53.729> like<00:01:53.820> x-wing

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
to like kill us when you're like x-wing

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.630 
to like kill us when you're like x-wing
midair<00:01:54.869> their<00:01:55.619> x-wing<00:01:56.040> back<00:01:56.189> and<00:01:56.369> forth<00:01:56.579> like

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
midair their x-wing back and forth like

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:57.920 
midair their x-wing back and forth like
it's<00:01:56.759> really<00:01:56.969> hard<00:01:57.180> to<00:01:57.270> hit<00:01:57.360> them<00:01:57.540> on<00:01:57.600> on<00:01:57.750> like

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
it's really hard to hit them on on like

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.630 
it's really hard to hit them on on like
a<00:01:57.960> higher<00:01:58.140> sensitivity<00:01:58.409> so<00:01:59.100> on<00:01:59.250> three<00:01:59.460> is<00:01:59.520> a

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
a higher sensitivity so on three is a

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.340 
a higher sensitivity so on three is a
little<00:01:59.909> bit<00:02:00.000> easier<00:02:00.299> and<00:02:00.570> also<00:02:00.869> hitting<00:02:01.200> the

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
little bit easier and also hitting the

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:02.810 
little bit easier and also hitting the
long-range<00:02:01.799> shots<00:02:02.070> on<00:02:02.280> three<00:02:02.460> is<00:02:02.579> a<00:02:02.610> lot

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
long-range shots on three is a lot

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.520 
long-range shots on three is a lot
easier<00:02:02.850> than<00:02:03.180> hitting<00:02:03.450> out<00:02:03.600> for<00:02:03.869> that's<00:02:04.350> just

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
easier than hitting out for that's just

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.289 
easier than hitting out for that's just
my<00:02:04.619> personal<00:02:05.040> opinion<00:02:05.130> about<00:02:05.549> it<00:02:05.700> so<00:02:06.180> if<00:02:06.240> you

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299

um when I get the car champs I'll test

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:23.330 
um when I get the car champs I'll test
it<00:02:21.659> out<00:02:21.750> a<00:02:21.810> little<00:02:21.930> bit<00:02:22.049> more<00:02:22.290> in<00:02:22.500> c3<00:02:23.010> on<00:02:23.129> land

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
it out a little bit more in c3 on land

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.179 
it out a little bit more in c3 on land
honestly<00:02:24.269> I<00:02:24.360> believe<00:02:24.989> that<00:02:25.019> I<00:02:25.290> on<00:02:25.560> land<00:02:25.799> the

00:02:26.179 --> 00:02:26.189 
honestly I believe that I on land the

00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:27.770 
honestly I believe that I on land the
sentence<00:02:26.489> TVs<00:02:26.700> get<00:02:26.849> a<00:02:26.879> little<00:02:27.329> little<00:02:27.569> little

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
sentence TVs get a little little little

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.140 
sentence TVs get a little little little
bit<00:02:28.170> faster<00:02:28.349> like<00:02:29.040> when<00:02:29.579> I<00:02:29.609> play<00:02:29.790> on<00:02:29.909> for

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
bit faster like when I play on for

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.030 
bit faster like when I play on for
online<00:02:30.420> it<00:02:30.540> felt<00:02:30.689> like<00:02:30.780> 5<00:02:31.140> online<00:02:31.409> like<00:02:31.769> they

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
online it felt like 5 online like they

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.429 
online it felt like 5 online like they
get<00:02:32.189> a<00:02:32.220> little<00:02:32.549> bit<00:02:33.120> faster<00:02:33.329> I<00:02:33.569> believe<00:02:33.989> some

00:02:34.429 --> 00:02:34.439

the<00:03:06.299> sensitivities<00:03:06.989> get<00:03:07.109> a<00:03:07.139> little<00:03:07.439> bit

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
the sensitivities get a little bit

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:09.170 
the sensitivities get a little bit
faster<00:03:07.859> land<00:03:08.069> I've<00:03:08.220> on<00:03:08.370> see<00:03:08.489> softest<00:03:08.849> since<00:03:09.090> I

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
faster land I've on see softest since I

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.390 
faster land I've on see softest since I
went<00:03:09.299> to<00:03:09.389> my<00:03:09.480> first<00:03:09.689> land<00:03:09.989> in<00:03:10.170> black<00:03:11.069> ops<00:03:11.280> 2

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
went to my first land in black ops 2

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:12.890 
went to my first land in black ops 2
that's<00:03:12.090> when<00:03:12.209> I<00:03:12.239> started<00:03:12.480> thinking<00:03:12.689> I'm<00:03:12.780> like

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
that's when I started thinking I'm like

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.569 
that's when I started thinking I'm like
wow<00:03:13.019> like<00:03:13.049> I<00:03:13.470> played<00:03:13.829> on<00:03:13.950> I<00:03:14.129> think<00:03:14.340> four<00:03:14.549> or

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:14.579 
wow like I played on I think four or

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:16.909 
wow like I played on I think four or
five<00:03:14.790> and<00:03:15.120> I<00:03:16.049> was<00:03:16.169> like<00:03:16.199> wow<00:03:16.410> I<00:03:16.560> feel<00:03:16.709> like<00:03:16.859> a

00:03:16.909 --> 00:03:16.919 
five and I was like wow I feel like a

00:03:16.919 --> 00:03:19.550 
five and I was like wow I feel like a
lot<00:03:17.250> faster<00:03:17.549> than<00:03:18.060> I<00:03:18.449> usually<00:03:18.900> do<00:03:19.139> a<00:03:19.169> lot<00:03:19.440> on

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
lot faster than I usually do a lot on

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.500 
lot faster than I usually do a lot on
the<00:03:19.650> sensitivity<00:03:20.220> so<00:03:20.370> i<00:03:20.400> was<00:03:20.579> like<00:03:20.699> maybe<00:03:21.329> I'm

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
the sensitivity so i was like maybe I'm

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:23.720 
the sensitivity so i was like maybe I'm
a<00:03:21.540> little<00:03:21.660> bit<00:03:21.900> crazy<00:03:22.109> but<00:03:22.500> now<00:03:23.220> i'm<00:03:23.310> just<00:03:23.519> i<00:03:23.639> i

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
a little bit crazy but now i'm just i i

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.089 
a little bit crazy but now i'm just i i
really<00:03:24.000> think<00:03:24.419> that<00:03:24.629> that's<00:03:25.079> how<00:03:25.440> it<00:03:25.560> is<00:03:25.650> I

00:03:26.089 --> 00:03:26.099 
really think that that's how it is I

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:28.099 
really think that that's how it is I
just<00:03:26.310> think<00:03:26.430> that<00:03:26.699> my<00:03:26.970> land<00:03:27.239> sentatives<00:03:28.019> you

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:28.109 
just think that my land sentatives you

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:29.990 
just think that my land sentatives you
get<00:03:28.230> a<00:03:28.260> little<00:03:28.409> bit<00:03:28.590> higher<00:03:28.739> and<00:03:29.040> that's<00:03:29.819> it

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
get a little bit higher and that's it

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.360 
get a little bit higher and that's it
but<00:03:30.989> yeah<00:03:31.139> so<00:03:31.379> I'll<00:03:31.769> just<00:03:31.829> like<00:03:32.069> called<00:03:32.280> you
