00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.940
 World Cup of Germany-2006 on June 16 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:08.340
 mexico had to face angola in 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.440
 hannover that day for the first time in the 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.910
 history of the worlds the selection 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:17.030
 I started a match with two players 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:17.030
 naturalized sinha and guille franco 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.029
 after the triumphant they will go in the 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:23.369
 presentation for many 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.590
 Angola meant three safe points 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.660
 but the game was as expected 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.000
 the start was promising 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.640
 Rafael Marquez burst the post in the 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.220
 first minutes and later that of 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.190
 Franco forgave the Africans but 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:41.340
 Until then Mexico dominated the game or more 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.180
 his production was null osvaldo asked 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.070
 calm 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.440
 Marquez began to get upset with his 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.350
 companions the same as the blow from 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.680
 the bank thus finished the first time 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.659
 with a tricolor that was starting to worry 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:57.000
 the supplement had a controversial start 

00:00:54.659 --> 00:00:59.549
 with a penalty that was not marked on the 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.949
 guille franco but mexico was still 

00:00:59.549 --> 00:01:05.489
 dominating and also failing first 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:08.130
 frank and then arellano later when 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.830
 sea ​​bravo the inoperability of angola was 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.619
 greater when at minute 79 he stayed with 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.630
 ten men for the expulsion of andrés 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:18.479
 but the story does not even change here 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.189
 fifth did not enter accurate and bravo followed 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.920
 failing before the desperation of 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:24.689
 national technician plus he 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:28.310
 Angolan goalkeeper was the figure of 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.310
 Marquis is only good then 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.470
 after 90 minutes Mexico was unable to 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.840
 make a goal 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.480
 angola celebrates the draw as a triumph 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:48.210
 while for ours the 

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:50.760
 result left a flavor to defeat less 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.590
 for the national technician if what 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:55.170
 it was meant for a celebration 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:58.310
 was turned into questions that 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:02.430
 further muddied the difficult environment 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:04.710
 world tricolor of Germany-2006 after 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:07.140
 the tie before angola the atmosphere in 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:09.000
 around the Mexican team changed in 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.010
 ricardo la volpe unleashed the war against 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.290
 the means by throwing water at some 

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:14.880
 photographers with that environment 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.980
 the tricolor was presented in gelsenkirchen 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.959
 to play the qualification to the 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.680
 second round against the opponent more 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:22.740
 complicated 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:25.260
 portugal selection that with the first 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:27.990
 insured place decided to give rest to 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:30.630
 deco and Christian ronaldo of the great 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:31.980
 Lusitanian stars alone Luis Figo took 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:34.380
 party in the party 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:38.300
 in just six minutes maniche 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:38.300
 ratified the tricolor crisis 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:57.810
 still missing the worst rafa marquez lived 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:00.390
 one of his blackest afternoons wronging 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:02.870
 all your passes and to top it off committing 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.870
 an end 

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:10.420
 then the qualification of mexico 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:10.420
 I was in danger 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:19.110
 However, after 5 minutes, the 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:21.470
 reaction that gave hope to the 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:21.470
 green 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:27.690
 and in the second time the tri seemed 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:29.640
 leave this lethargy with a nothing 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:32.030
 brilliant that caused a penalty 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.030
 controversial 

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:47.859
 was the expected opportunity a goal that 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:50.549
 would ensure the qualification but that 

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:50.549
 never arrived 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:01.360
 shortly after Luis Perez was expelled 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:03.770
 for trying to cheat the referee 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:06.290
 situation that could influence so that the 

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:08.210
 whistle lubes michel not dare to 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:12.260
 mark a clear criminal on omar bravo 

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:14.240
 well the time was over and mexico 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:16.820
 advanced to the next phase with 

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:19.250
 suspense for the tie between irán and 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:22.520
 angola in mexico was already in the second 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:25.120
 round with a football that nobody lost 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:25.120
 single 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:32.360
 of Germany-2006 was the city of 

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:33.979
 leipzig on june 24 mexico and 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:37.419
 Argentina jumped to the court in the 

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:37.419
 round of the round of 16 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:52.910
 margin store in the big favorite but 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.009
 just at minute 6 Mexico he said to 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:57.370
 world that the outcome could be 

00:04:55.009 --> 00:04:57.370
 different 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:14.470
 the joy was ephemeral so only four 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:17.669
 minutes later Argentina was asserting its 

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:17.669
 big team condition 

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:27.090
 from now on the game became dramatic 

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:29.250
 osvaldo was in charge of ruining a 

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:32.370
 very clear opportunity of hernán the rest 

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:35.100
 and shortly after it was abbondanzieri who 

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:37.860
 with a masterful tackle prevented the goal 

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:40.110
 of borgetti but fortune too 

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:42.840
 he plays and that day he took sides 

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:45.810
 Argentina at minute 38 

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:47.310
 pavel pardo came out injured situation 

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:50.130
 that affected the midfield and the 

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:52.590
 distribution of the ball and in the second 

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:54.360
 time was andré saved who despite 

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:57.060
 to play his first game in world 

00:05:54.360 --> 00:06:00.030
 had distinguished himself as one of the 

00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:02.100
 better on the court still Mexico 

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:04.140
 his best game in the world and the 

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:06.690
 attention was kept mostly with the 

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:09.000
 lionel messi's entrance 

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:11.430
 however by getty it was still a 

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:14.540
 happy in the argentine area and osvaldo 

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:14.540
 it looked insurmountable 

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:25.550
 the tie stayed again mexico 

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:27.950
 I had to suffer the stressful times 

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:28.880
 extras to make history or stay 

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:31.910
 as usual 

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:34.120
 in those 30 minutes more there were no errors 

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:37.040
 of ours but a genius 

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:39.050
 unrepeatable of the Argentines was the one 

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:41.740
 he scored 2-1 

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:41.740
 good 

00:06:51.639 --> 00:06:58.340
 but 

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:58.340
 a little bit of everything 

00:06:59.139 --> 00:07:02.949
 the advantage was handled by the 

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:04.900
 Argentines in their own way 

00:07:02.949 --> 00:07:07.210
 staying with them with the triumph and 

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:09.629
 we with the sad consolation of 

00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:09.629
 forever 

00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:24.030
 the history of mexico in the world 

00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:24.030
 an avid history of revenge 

00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:28.750
 and this was the story of the 13 

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:31.210
 Mexico's medal shares in the 

00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:33.610
 world six ratings twice is 

00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:35.860
 led to the quarterfinals and in four 

00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:37.990
 consecutive occasions the most recent 

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:40.360
 to the second round 

00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:42.970
 the trend says that it is getting more 

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:46.900
 close to return to the quarterfinals 

00:07:42.970 --> 00:07:49.630
 I hope and it's in South Africa-2010 

00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:51.900
 thank you very much for joining us more 

00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:51.900
