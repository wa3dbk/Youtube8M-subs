00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:07.549

00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:09.350
 dreams, after all, no, but we are 

00:00:07.549 --> 00:00:10.639
 advancing let's go out there was the 

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:12.770
 residence of the jury who spoke 

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:16.730
 composed in particular the juries do not 

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:20.180
 no we are not talking about participating in 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:22.820
 the program but if I get to be it will be 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:25.550
 let me take a little bit so the 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:30.560
 production would be crossed with moria 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:37.970
 casan are not things that are not counted 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:41.600
 would be indecent until the sixth so much that 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:44.210
 you talk for two days or so putting 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.579

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:48.110

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:49.190
 jury know and who ends up being 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:51.680
 jury in what measures now what 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:53.239
 important is that you feel like yes yes no 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.649
 I would not be talking is also the 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:58.370
 possibility of making a character 

00:00:54.649 --> 00:01:00.649

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:02.480

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:06.260
 a little what the block wants 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:13.010
 I want to know I do not know how to 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:14.450
 I do not know what this proposal will be like and 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:15.980
 that always wants you loves you 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:19.490

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:22.220

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:24.470
 father and this one also studies but these 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:27.090
 two years call me in the middle of another by 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:30.149
 luck and this 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.530
 I'm not there is nothing solved per day 

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:34.310
 from today now came I want to load a thing 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.310
 that says out there tomorrow 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:40.939
 you have to talk to her 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:57.140
 it's also a little bit just last year in 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.940
 study with susana este and 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.950
 and some way from the proposal that 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:03.680
 have renewed and is distinct to 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.640
 another weird thing but what are we 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.530
 doing 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.440
 with susana we always end with the 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.390
 grandmother that does not seem bad to me but 17 ago 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:16.720
 years that we do the same in the dancing 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:22.890
 there is talk of being in the last chair 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:22.890
 I do not know if I'm the last one and more in the middle 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:26.970
 of the end 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:36.270
 well I will do this second that I 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.460
 it matters, I look, it's done that this is not 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:41.100
 to argue or to fight me is for 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:42.960
 have fun enjoying it is something that is 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:45.150
 know why I understand dance has 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:46.620
 non-theater air choreographies 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.940
 young guys who have money now 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.700
 they danced with me in the bad pass of 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:52.800
 four years as big as queen dance 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:55.020
 with my memory as there was work is 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:56.730
 say I understand this and that's why I get 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:58.620
 If I could not say a word, I would not 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:00.540
 put as a topic of disrespect 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:03.020
 of the participants there will be lack of 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.020
 respect 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.120
 the truth so that it is for you 

00:03:05.439 --> 00:03:09.790
 lack the respect you have to have 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:12.060
 weak your will or your respect to 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:12.060
 yourself
