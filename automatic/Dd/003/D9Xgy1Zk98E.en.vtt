00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
basic black seat but I thought that was

basic black seat but I thought that was
really<00:01:17.909> comfortable<00:01:18.360> so<00:01:18.509> I<00:01:18.540> put<00:01:18.750> this<00:01:18.869> on<00:01:19.049> and

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
really comfortable so I put this on and

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.980 
really comfortable so I put this on and
just<00:01:19.860> rubber<00:01:20.130> grips<00:01:20.580> up<00:01:20.790> here<00:01:21.060> so<00:01:21.689> I'm<00:01:21.840> just

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
just rubber grips up here so I'm just

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.130 
just rubber grips up here so I'm just
going<00:01:22.200> to<00:01:22.580> fry<00:01:23.580> it<00:01:23.640> around<00:01:24.030> a<00:01:24.210> little<00:01:24.330> bit<00:01:24.479> so

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
going to fry it around a little bit so

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:34.960 
going to fry it around a little bit so
that<00:01:25.170> you<00:01:25.380> can<00:01:25.560> get<00:01:25.740> a<00:01:25.770> better<00:01:26.070> idea<00:01:26.189> of

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:34.970 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:55.890 

it<00:01:35.970> helps<00:01:36.210> me<00:01:36.299> I'm<00:01:36.390> not<00:01:36.479> in<00:01:36.630> the<00:01:36.690> heart<00:01:36.869> is<00:01:36.990> here

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:55.900 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:58.200 

so<00:01:56.380> as<00:01:56.560> you<00:01:56.680> can<00:01:56.770> see<00:01:56.830> I'm<00:01:57.280> leaning<00:01:57.580> over<00:01:57.670> a<00:01:57.940> bit

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.210 
so as you can see I'm leaning over a bit

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:00.900 
so as you can see I'm leaning over a bit
but<00:01:58.660> not<00:01:58.780> too<00:01:58.840> much<00:01:59.080> it's<00:02:00.010> a<00:02:00.160> much<00:02:00.340> faster<00:02:00.580> ride

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:00.910 
but not too much it's a much faster ride

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:03.180 
but not too much it's a much faster ride
when<00:02:01.120> I'm<00:02:01.210> not<00:02:01.360> in<00:02:01.540> deep<00:02:01.900> grass<00:02:02.650> but<00:02:02.980> I<00:02:03.010> hope

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:03.190 
when I'm not in deep grass but I hope

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:06.260 
when I'm not in deep grass but I hope
that<00:02:03.370> gives<00:02:03.520> you<00:02:03.640> a<00:02:03.700> pretty<00:02:04.030> good<00:02:04.330> idea<00:02:05.040> if
