two<00:02:06.390> hundred<00:02:06.540> and<00:02:06.780> forty<00:02:07.079> dollars<00:02:07.200> whereas

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
two hundred and forty dollars whereas

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.040 
two hundred and forty dollars whereas
none<00:02:07.860> of<00:02:07.979> the<00:02:08.039> other<00:02:08.280> jackets<00:02:08.819> cost<00:02:09.420> over<00:02:09.869> two
