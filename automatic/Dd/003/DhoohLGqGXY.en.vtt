because<00:00:54.170> my<00:00:55.170> opinion<00:00:55.620> on<00:00:55.770> this<00:00:55.949> and<00:00:56.010> as<00:00:56.399> Pro

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
because my opinion on this and as Pro

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.150 
because my opinion on this and as Pro
just<00:00:57.480> from<00:00:57.809> what<00:00:57.989> I've<00:00:58.109> been<00:00:58.140> reading<00:00:58.500> so<00:00:58.859> far

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
just from what I've been reading so far

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.840 
just from what I've been reading so far
I<00:00:59.430> think<00:00:59.820> that's<00:01:00.270> probably<00:01:00.960> because<00:01:01.370> they<00:01:02.370> in

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
I think that's probably because they in

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.920 
I think that's probably because they in
order<00:01:03.180> to<00:01:03.359> make<00:01:03.539> the<00:01:03.780> phone<00:01:04.710> thinner<00:01:05.189> and

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:05.930 
order to make the phone thinner and

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.710
