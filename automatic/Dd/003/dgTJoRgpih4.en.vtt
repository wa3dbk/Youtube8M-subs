00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:21.090
 the three comrades greet juanjo 

00:00:18.599 --> 00:00:23.099
 Today, I bring you a video about 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.680
 the scams in the food business 

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:28.230
 quick I will focus on three chains of 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.149
 fast food burger king mcdonald's and 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.710
 kfc 

00:00:29.149 --> 00:00:34.050
 First of all this video is not for 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.660
 defaming those restaurants is only for 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.190
 that they reconsider because there are times that 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.290
 is the restaurant announces a 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.150
 promotion and things can happen for not 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.420
 make it current or if they give you the 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:48.480
 promotion but not as you get announced 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:51.120
 ok then let's start first I'll talk 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.130
 about burger king it is worth mentioning that a 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.110
 I like their burgers but there 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:56.820
 times that promotions do not 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:00.720
 worth it and you stay a flavor 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:04.059
 bitter for example announce you this and you 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:06.610
 give this hahaha ok I exaggerated 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:08.649
 but seriously speaking the following 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:10.869
 of photos that I will show you are from clients 

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:13.149
 of burger king in the burger 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:14.770
 king of mexico all the photos 

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:16.530
 you can find on the page 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:19.689
 official facebook of burger king mexico 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.580
 here we can see a whopper but you 

00:01:19.689 --> 00:01:24.820
 They put a meat of water juniors 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:27.820
 xd now see this one of a whopper that 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:29.500
 passed cooking and was burned 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:32.320
 what is that black that has water but 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:34.840
 apparently they exaggerated with the mounting of 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:36.970
 this hold on and that they announce it to you 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.799
 so for apparently they removed one 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:41.830
 promotion before the announced date 

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:44.049
 that caused a lot of annoying customers a 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:45.909
 already classic promotion in burger king is 

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:48.369
 that when the Mexican national team plays 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:50.979
 of soccer if you win the game they give you 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:53.439
 a whopper juniors free but you have 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:55.479
 have to buy some small potatoes but 

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:57.789
 when you go to the restaurant they tell you that 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:02:00.090
 you have to be big potatoes if you do not 

00:01:57.789 --> 00:02:03.450
 they give neither a pussy 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.109
 now I will talk about mcdonald so what 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.020
 I can say 

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:08.910
 this is the chain with the most complaints not only 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.550
 for their promotions but for the quality 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.319
 of your food, by the way, I invite you to 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:15.330
 that you see my video about secrets and 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:17.160
 rumors of mcdonald's that is in the 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:20.100
 description of the video so that 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:22.740
 understand the quality of mcdonald's 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:24.810
 just like burger king mcdonald's does not 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:28.140
 it stays behind as far as nonconformity 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:30.690
 of the client for example to announce this 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.820
 and they give you this there are also clients that 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:35.360
 they complain about the poor service and quality of 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:38.510
 mcdonald's food 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.970
 and finally we will talk about kfc at 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.630
 same as the two restaurants 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:44.420
 previously mentioned 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:47.180
 kfc does not give a service as it should and does not 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:50.990
 Valid promotions for example 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:53.320
 they announce this to you and they give you this x of 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:53.320
 shit 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:59.260

 past something similar to what was said in the 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:08.230
 video and if they have been scammed I would 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:10.180
