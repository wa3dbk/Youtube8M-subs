00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:06.540
 big hello to all of you quickly 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.490
 I'm telling you what's the matter with me yesterday 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.860
 in this pot accidentally burned 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.900
 carrot really doesn't matter what 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:16.710
 burned but you know it was 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:18.750
 carrots and all that could be cleaned 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:22.260
 easy of course i cleaned and here 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:25.230
 there was a black burned patina on the bottom 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:30.000
 pans enamel pan here i am 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:31.740
 poured water and boiled this water poured 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.320
 then citric acid you see what 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:40.770
 happens if you see that you can see that 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:46.140
 black shmotochki swim already in the water column 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:51.000
 and some black bits are like 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:54.030
 center to the right is still partially stuck to 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.010
 the bottom of the pan partially they rest in 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.160
 water that is thus obtained 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:03.989
 that I boil a pot at the bottom of which 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:05.970
 burnt carrot water contains lemon 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.549
 its acid what happens all these 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:11.939
 black pieces peel off 1 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:14.850
 and I really hope that I have all this 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:16.049
 will help that in the end I will succeed 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.210
 easy without difficulty 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:21.420
 clean this pan and she will already 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.520
 ready today and I'll cook in it 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.430
 the potatoes are really up to the pan 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:29.930
 they just so I took care of it all so 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.930
 Well, let's see what happens next 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:41.380
 but then I acted with ordinary water 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:44.640
 ordinary sponge as we see on the ice is very 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:48.160
 easy and then walks alone 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:51.250
 pots here it remains that some spots 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:53.140
 I think I will need powder already 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:56.320
 polish to perfection 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:02:02.140
 but here it is itself suitable for this here 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:05.110
 so very easy moving away from over shade 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:08.530
 absolutely not the same as scrape 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:11.820
 it's all with powder for a long time and so 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:14.470
 more than some iron metal 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:18.030
 such a special washcloth all you 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.030
 have to just turn on al 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:32.150
 Well, that's all easy and simple of course not 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:36.159
 perfect condition but I will not with 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:39.890
 your permission to fan and leave so 

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:41.750
 the rest is already up to cleaned for 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:43.489
 subsequent wash and pan on 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:46.310
 believe in a week will be perfect 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:47.239
 white the most important thing is that this creepy 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:49.129
 black soot 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:52.159
 which was formed after there 

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:56.780
 burnt food namely carrots without 

00:02:52.159 --> 00:03:00.079
 labor strain and proudly torment succeeded 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:03.680
 remove as follows boiling in 

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:05.599
 for about let's say somewhere 10 minutes I 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:08.329
 time intersected for example we are somewhere 

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:10.730
 10 minutes with a small amount 

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:15.680
 I do not know exactly how much citric acid 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:18.200
 but somewhere probably 2 grams probably 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:21.019
 in general let's say a tablespoon two 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:23.359
 tablespoons about here and the remains i 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:25.720
 already removed abrasive powder not 

00:03:23.359 --> 00:03:30.260
 perfect but nevertheless quite 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:32.919
 enough to ruin the potatoes all 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.919
 bye everyone
