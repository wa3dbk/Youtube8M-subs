making some modifications that I had no

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.119 
making some modifications that I had no
idea<00:00:48.660> I<00:00:48.719> was<00:00:48.899> going<00:00:49.230> to<00:00:49.379> do<00:00:49.500> when<00:00:49.649> I<00:00:49.680> set<00:00:49.980> out<00:00:50.100> to

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
idea I was going to do when I set out to

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.639 
idea I was going to do when I set out to
make<00:00:50.370> this<00:00:50.550> thing<00:00:50.969> so<00:00:51.239> I'm<00:00:52.050> really<00:00:52.199> happy<00:00:52.410> with

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
make this thing so I'm really happy with

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.549 
make this thing so I'm really happy with
the<00:00:52.770> way<00:00:52.890> that<00:00:53.280> it<00:00:53.340> turned<00:00:53.820> out<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.270> first

00:00:54.549 --> 00:00:54.559 
the way that it turned out the first

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:58.670 
the way that it turned out the first
major<00:00:55.559> thing<00:00:55.920> that<00:00:56.039> you<00:00:56.160> notice<00:00:56.460> is<00:00:57.350> it's<00:00:58.350> got

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
major thing that you notice is it's got

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.670 
major thing that you notice is it's got
fabric<00:00:58.980> on<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.399> outside<00:01:00.289> that<00:01:01.289> happened

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
fabric on the outside that happened

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.290 
fabric on the outside that happened
because<00:01:01.770> I<00:01:02.010> actually<00:01:02.430> went<00:01:02.789> and<00:01:02.879> bought<00:01:03.030> some

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
because I actually went and bought some

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.780 
because I actually went and bought some
spray<00:01:03.629> paint<00:01:03.660> and<00:01:04.199> of<00:01:04.799> course<00:01:05.070> I<00:01:05.220> made<00:01:05.430> sure

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
spray paint and of course I made sure

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.410 
spray paint and of course I made sure
that<00:01:06.570> it<00:01:06.689> said<00:01:06.930> bonds<00:01:07.560> to<00:01:07.710> plastic<00:01:08.420> the

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
that it said bonds to plastic the

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.830 
that it said bonds to plastic the
problem<00:01:09.780> is<00:01:10.280> it<00:01:11.280> didn't<00:01:11.640> bond<00:01:11.820> it<00:01:12.119> to<00:01:12.240> plastic

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
problem is it didn't bond it to plastic

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.289 
problem is it didn't bond it to plastic
you<00:01:13.680> can<00:01:13.830> actually<00:01:13.979> see<00:01:14.369> where<00:01:14.549> it<00:01:14.729> flaked<00:01:15.060> off

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
you can actually see where it flaked off

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.719 
you can actually see where it flaked off
here<00:01:15.570> on<00:01:15.720> the<00:01:15.840> inside<00:01:15.990> a<00:01:16.290> little<00:01:16.530> bit<00:01:16.740> I<00:01:17.070> had

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
here on the inside a little bit I had

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.749 
here on the inside a little bit I had
let<00:01:17.970> it<00:01:18.000> dry<00:01:18.390> and<00:01:18.780> then<00:01:18.840> as<00:01:19.799> I'd<00:01:20.070> handle<00:01:20.490> it<00:01:20.580> it

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
let it dry and then as I'd handle it it

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.230 
let it dry and then as I'd handle it it
started<00:01:21.119> to<00:01:21.330> to<00:01:22.189> kind<00:01:23.189> of<00:01:23.280> just<00:01:23.490> chip<00:01:23.759> off<00:01:23.939> and

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
started to to kind of just chip off and

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.330 
started to to kind of just chip off and
I<00:01:24.479> was<00:01:24.600> really<00:01:24.780> frustrated<00:01:25.049> so<00:01:25.770> I<00:01:25.799> was<00:01:26.159> sitting

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
I was really frustrated so I was sitting

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.399 
I was really frustrated so I was sitting
around<00:01:26.580> in<00:01:26.820> trying<00:01:27.240> to<00:01:27.630> figure<00:01:27.960> out<00:01:28.020> what<00:01:28.259> to

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
around in trying to figure out what to

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.050 
around in trying to figure out what to
do<00:01:28.560> with<00:01:28.770> this<00:01:28.950> since<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:29.670> paint<00:01:29.850> was

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
do with this since the paint was

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.969 
do with this since the paint was
chipping<00:01:30.360> off<00:01:30.630> of<00:01:30.840> it<00:01:30.960> and<00:01:31.140> I<00:01:31.200> thought<00:01:31.799> to

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
chipping off of it and I thought to

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.710 
chipping off of it and I thought to
myself<00:01:32.100> I<00:01:32.340> wish<00:01:32.490> I<00:01:32.579> had<00:01:32.700> some<00:01:32.909> type<00:01:33.060> of<00:01:33.090> fabric

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
myself I wish I had some type of fabric

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.109 
myself I wish I had some type of fabric
or<00:01:33.900> something<00:01:34.380> that<00:01:35.250> I<00:01:35.280> could<00:01:35.369> wrap<00:01:35.700> around

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
or something that I could wrap around

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.120 
or something that I could wrap around
this<00:01:36.329> and<00:01:36.570> kind<00:01:37.020> of<00:01:37.110> make<00:01:37.229> it<00:01:37.259> look<00:01:37.530> nice<00:01:37.860> and

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
this and kind of make it look nice and

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.530 
this and kind of make it look nice and
neat<00:01:38.340> and<00:01:38.400> maybe<00:01:38.729> look<00:01:39.150> a<00:01:39.240> little<00:01:39.360> bit

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
neat and maybe look a little bit

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.109 
neat and maybe look a little bit
different<00:01:39.990> and<00:01:40.189> it<00:01:41.189> just<00:01:41.549> dawned<00:01:41.759> on<00:01:41.909> me<00:01:41.970> that

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
different and it just dawned on me that

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.690 
different and it just dawned on me that
I'd<00:01:42.329> purchase<00:01:42.840> some<00:01:42.990> new<00:01:43.140> socks<00:01:43.470> and<00:01:43.829> so<00:01:44.670> I

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
I'd purchase some new socks and so I

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.240 
I'd purchase some new socks and so I
figured<00:01:45.299> well<00:01:45.659> that's<00:01:45.899> a<00:01:46.200> sock<00:01:46.560> is<00:01:46.799> nice<00:01:47.009> and

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
figured well that's a sock is nice and

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.399 
figured well that's a sock is nice and
kind<00:01:47.700> of<00:01:47.759> tight<00:01:48.060> already<00:01:48.450> maybe<00:01:48.750> I<00:01:48.869> can<00:01:49.110> slide

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
kind of tight already maybe I can slide

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.620 
kind of tight already maybe I can slide
this<00:01:49.619> right<00:01:49.829> over<00:01:50.220> it<00:01:50.369> and<00:01:50.490> it<00:01:51.240> actually

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
this right over it and it actually

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.270 
this right over it and it actually
worked<00:01:51.840> out<00:01:51.990> pretty<00:01:52.200> well<00:01:52.320> one<00:01:52.979> of<00:01:53.100> the<00:01:53.220> things

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
worked out pretty well one of the things

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.859 
worked out pretty well one of the things
I<00:01:53.579> was<00:01:53.670> actually<00:01:54.060> concerned<00:01:54.450> about<00:01:54.600> with

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
I was actually concerned about with

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.569 
I was actually concerned about with
making<00:01:55.049> this<00:01:55.290> viewfinder<00:01:55.590> was<00:01:56.219> you<00:01:56.460> know<00:01:56.549> I

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
making this viewfinder was you know I

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.760 
making this viewfinder was you know I
didn't<00:01:56.820> want<00:01:56.939> to<00:01:57.030> scratch<00:01:57.450> up<00:01:57.479> my<00:01:57.869> LCD<00:01:58.409> screen

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
didn't want to scratch up my LCD screen

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.149 
didn't want to scratch up my LCD screen
oh<00:01:58.950> my<00:01:59.549> god<00:01:59.840> you<00:02:00.840> know<00:02:00.930> I<00:02:00.960> just<00:02:01.140> cut<00:02:01.350> one<00:02:01.680> end<00:02:01.920> of

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
oh my god you know I just cut one end of

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:06.230 
oh my god you know I just cut one end of
it<00:02:02.340> and<00:02:03.649> ended<00:02:04.649> up<00:02:04.799> you<00:02:05.460> know<00:02:05.490> hot<00:02:05.820> gluing

it and ended up you know hot gluing
around<00:02:06.509> the<00:02:06.630> inside<00:02:07.079> here<00:02:07.649> and<00:02:07.879> then<00:02:08.879> kind<00:02:09.179> of

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
around the inside here and then kind of

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.540 
around the inside here and then kind of
wrapped<00:02:09.479> the<00:02:09.750> sock<00:02:09.989> around<00:02:10.170> neatly<00:02:10.679> and<00:02:11.129> and

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
wrapped the sock around neatly and and

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.520 
wrapped the sock around neatly and and
tried<00:02:11.730> to<00:02:11.849> do<00:02:11.970> it<00:02:12.060> as<00:02:12.180> evenly<00:02:12.540> as<00:02:12.629> I<00:02:12.870> could

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
tried to do it as evenly as I could

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.100 
tried to do it as evenly as I could
and<00:02:13.620> then<00:02:13.950> on<00:02:14.069> the<00:02:14.160> top<00:02:14.340> part<00:02:14.730> you<00:02:15.110> can

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
and then on the top part you can

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.080 
and then on the top part you can
actually<00:02:16.470> see<00:02:16.709> that<00:02:16.950> there's<00:02:17.220> this<00:02:17.850> side

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
actually see that there's this side

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.150 
actually see that there's this side
looks<00:02:18.360> really<00:02:18.780> good<00:02:18.930> I<00:02:18.990> got<00:02:19.319> the<00:02:19.350> seams<00:02:19.740> I<00:02:19.950> took

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
looks really good I got the seams I took

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.910 
looks really good I got the seams I took
my<00:02:20.310> time<00:02:20.580> when<00:02:21.090> I<00:02:21.120> hot-glued<00:02:21.709> you<00:02:22.709> know<00:02:22.860> you

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
my time when I hot-glued you know you

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.300 
my time when I hot-glued you know you
kind<00:02:23.550> of<00:02:23.610> have<00:02:23.819> to<00:02:24.030> cut<00:02:24.930> a<00:02:24.959> little<00:02:25.260> bit<00:02:25.380> around

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
kind of have to cut a little bit around

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.160 
kind of have to cut a little bit around
the<00:02:26.430> edges<00:02:26.520> so<00:02:27.209> you<00:02:27.300> can<00:02:27.450> bring<00:02:27.660> your<00:02:27.780> fabric

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
the edges so you can bring your fabric

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:29.750 
the edges so you can bring your fabric
in<00:02:28.319> nice<00:02:28.530> and<00:02:28.770> tight<00:02:28.950> and<00:02:29.130> then<00:02:29.250> kind<00:02:29.459> of<00:02:29.520> tuck

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
in nice and tight and then kind of tuck

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.540 
in nice and tight and then kind of tuck
it<00:02:29.910> here<00:02:30.300> this<00:02:31.200> I<00:02:31.380> actually<00:02:31.560> didn't<00:02:32.040> even<00:02:32.130> glue

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
it here this I actually didn't even glue

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:38.150 
it here this I actually didn't even glue
in<00:02:34.010> and<00:02:35.300> but<00:02:36.300> as<00:02:36.420> you<00:02:36.690> put<00:02:37.680> some<00:02:37.860> glue<00:02:38.069> around

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
in and but as you put some glue around

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:39.590 
in and but as you put some glue around
the<00:02:38.370> inside<00:02:38.790> here<00:02:39.090> and<00:02:39.120> you<00:02:39.209> kind<00:02:39.360> of<00:02:39.450> have<00:02:39.569> to

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
the inside here and you kind of have to

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.540 
the inside here and you kind of have to
tuck<00:02:39.870> this<00:02:40.020> fabric<00:02:40.470> in<00:02:40.650> you<00:02:41.190> know<00:02:41.280> you<00:02:41.340> have<00:02:41.459> to

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 
tuck this fabric in you know you have to

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:43.160 
tuck this fabric in you know you have to
make<00:02:41.670> a<00:02:41.700> couple<00:02:41.970> of<00:02:42.060> cuts<00:02:42.300> so<00:02:42.510> that<00:02:42.540> the<00:02:42.810> fabric

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
make a couple of cuts so that the fabric

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:44.960 
make a couple of cuts so that the fabric
lays<00:02:43.500> flat<00:02:43.800> and<00:02:44.040> doesn't<00:02:44.280> kind<00:02:44.370> of<00:02:44.520> fold<00:02:44.760> over

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
lays flat and doesn't kind of fold over

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.570 
lays flat and doesn't kind of fold over
top<00:02:45.270> of<00:02:45.300> it<00:02:45.600> and<00:02:45.959> I<00:02:46.350> did<00:02:46.620> a<00:02:46.680> good<00:02:46.800> job<00:02:46.860> on<00:02:47.220> on

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
top of it and I did a good job on on

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.100 
top of it and I did a good job on on
this<00:02:47.820> side<00:02:48.060> and<00:02:48.420> then<00:02:48.570> I<00:02:48.690> started<00:02:48.989> working

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
this side and then I started working

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.020 
this side and then I started working
real<00:02:49.410> fast<00:02:49.680> over<00:02:50.070> here<00:02:50.340> so<00:02:50.550> you<00:02:50.640> can<00:02:50.760> kind<00:02:50.940> of

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
real fast over here so you can kind of

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:54.890 
real fast over here so you can kind of
see<00:02:51.209> I've<00:02:51.300> got<00:02:51.480> two<00:02:51.660> big<00:02:52.190> scars<00:02:53.190> here<00:02:53.340> I<00:02:54.120> went

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
see I've got two big scars here I went

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.520 
see I've got two big scars here I went
back<00:02:55.080> and<00:02:55.410> got<00:02:55.620> a<00:02:56.660> black<00:02:57.660> magic<00:02:57.870> marker<00:02:58.140> and

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
back and got a black magic marker and

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:59.750 
back and got a black magic marker and
kind<00:02:58.680> of<00:02:58.769> covered<00:02:59.040> it<00:02:59.220> up<00:02:59.310> a<00:02:59.370> little<00:02:59.459> bit<00:02:59.670> it

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
kind of covered it up a little bit it

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.300 
kind of covered it up a little bit it
doesn't<00:02:59.910> look<00:03:00.120> bad<00:03:00.650> this<00:03:01.650> side<00:03:01.860> looks<00:03:02.069> really

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
doesn't look bad this side looks really

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:06.199 
doesn't look bad this side looks really
great<00:03:02.519> I<00:03:02.580> think<00:03:02.730> but<00:03:03.239> anyway<00:03:03.810> this<00:03:05.060> fits<00:03:06.060> in

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
great I think but anyway this fits in

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:07.580 
great I think but anyway this fits in
here<00:03:06.360> so<00:03:06.569> snug<00:03:06.870> that<00:03:06.900> I<00:03:07.050> didn't<00:03:07.260> I<00:03:07.319> actually

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
here so snug that I didn't I actually

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.530 
here so snug that I didn't I actually
didn't<00:03:08.040> even<00:03:08.100> have<00:03:08.310> to<00:03:08.400> glue<00:03:08.610> it<00:03:08.730> in<00:03:08.850> there<00:03:09.120> so

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
didn't even have to glue it in there so

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.449 
didn't even have to glue it in there so
the<00:03:10.290> other<00:03:10.319> thing<00:03:10.650> I<00:03:10.739> did<00:03:10.890> that<00:03:10.920> was<00:03:11.130> a<00:03:11.250> little

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
the other thing I did that was a little

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:13.100 
the other thing I did that was a little
bit<00:03:11.640> different<00:03:11.850> was<00:03:12.239> instead<00:03:12.720> of<00:03:12.840> using<00:03:12.989> the

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
bit different was instead of using the

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:16.270 
bit different was instead of using the
rubber<00:03:13.290> bands<00:03:13.769> to<00:03:14.040> attach<00:03:14.940> this<00:03:15.239> to<00:03:15.300> my<00:03:15.569> DSLR

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.280 
rubber bands to attach this to my DSLR

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.789 
rubber bands to attach this to my DSLR
or<00:03:17.280> the<00:03:18.090> hair<00:03:18.269> bands<00:03:18.630> I<00:03:18.810> decided<00:03:19.410> I<00:03:19.560> wanted<00:03:19.739> to

00:03:19.789 --> 00:03:19.799 
or the hair bands I decided I wanted to

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:23.600 
or the hair bands I decided I wanted to
try<00:03:20.130> using<00:03:20.700> a<00:03:21.510> little<00:03:22.290> bit<00:03:22.440> of<00:03:22.590> elastic<00:03:22.829> and<00:03:23.340> so

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:23.610 
try using a little bit of elastic and so

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:26.900 
try using a little bit of elastic and so
for<00:03:23.940> like<00:03:24.090> a<00:03:24.120> buck<00:03:24.570> 20<00:03:24.959> at<00:03:25.610> Walmart<00:03:26.610> and<00:03:26.760> wasn't

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
for like a buck 20 at Walmart and wasn't

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:29.020 
for like a buck 20 at Walmart and wasn't
got<00:03:27.150> some<00:03:27.420> and<00:03:27.570> I<00:03:27.630> actually<00:03:27.810> what<00:03:28.110> I<00:03:28.140> did<00:03:28.320> was<00:03:28.530> I

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:29.030 
got some and I actually what I did was I

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:31.069 
got some and I actually what I did was I
cut<00:03:30.030> it<00:03:30.150> because<00:03:30.420> you<00:03:30.540> want<00:03:30.660> it<00:03:30.750> to<00:03:30.810> be<00:03:30.930> really

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:31.079 
cut it because you want it to be really

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:33.800 
cut it because you want it to be really
snug<00:03:31.530> and<00:03:31.860> so<00:03:32.519> that<00:03:32.730> it<00:03:32.820> really<00:03:33.030> grips<00:03:33.420> ahold

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
snug and so that it really grips ahold

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:37.880 
snug and so that it really grips ahold
of<00:03:34.140> your<00:03:34.739> LCD<00:03:35.160> panel<00:03:35.850> and<00:03:36.239> so<00:03:37.170> I<00:03:37.200> measured<00:03:37.799> it

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:37.890 
of your LCD panel and so I measured it

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:40.030 
of your LCD panel and so I measured it
out<00:03:38.070> and<00:03:38.250> then<00:03:38.340> I<00:03:38.400> actually<00:03:38.640> stapled<00:03:39.540> it<00:03:39.690> in

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.040 
out and then I actually stapled it in

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:42.920 
out and then I actually stapled it in
place<00:03:41.040> in<00:03:41.310> and<00:03:41.640> it<00:03:41.760> held<00:03:41.970> really<00:03:42.150> nicely<00:03:42.450> you

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
place in and it held really nicely you

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:44.360 
place in and it held really nicely you
kind<00:03:43.230> of<00:03:43.290> have<00:03:43.410> to<00:03:43.470> Jimmy<00:03:43.769> rig<00:03:43.980> it<00:03:44.100> a<00:03:44.160> little

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
kind of have to Jimmy rig it a little

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:45.560 
kind of have to Jimmy rig it a little
bit<00:03:44.519> to<00:03:44.609> make<00:03:44.700> sure<00:03:44.760> and<00:03:45.000> get<00:03:45.090> it<00:03:45.150> get<00:03:45.450> your

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:45.570 
bit to make sure and get it get your

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:47.360 
bit to make sure and get it get your
staples<00:03:45.989> straight<00:03:46.350> but<00:03:46.890> actually<00:03:47.190> when<00:03:47.340> you

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
staples straight but actually when you

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:51.050 
staples straight but actually when you
fold<00:03:47.850> over<00:03:48.410> the<00:03:49.410> fabric<00:03:49.590> on<00:03:49.890> the<00:03:50.010> inside<00:03:50.549> I

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
fold over the fabric on the inside I

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.360 
fold over the fabric on the inside I
actually<00:03:51.660> added<00:03:52.049> a<00:03:52.380> little<00:03:52.530> bit<00:03:52.709> of<00:03:52.799> fabric<00:03:53.160> in

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
actually added a little bit of fabric in

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:56.479 
actually added a little bit of fabric in
there<00:03:54.299> to<00:03:54.600> cover<00:03:55.170> the<00:03:55.380> staples<00:03:55.620> so<00:03:56.100> it<00:03:56.250> didn't

00:03:56.479 --> 00:03:56.489 
there to cover the staples so it didn't

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:59.870 
there to cover the staples so it didn't
scratch<00:03:56.910> up<00:03:57.180> my<00:03:57.420> Maya<00:03:58.320> LCD<00:03:59.040> screen<00:03:59.400> there<00:03:59.609> but

00:03:59.870 --> 00:03:59.880 
scratch up my Maya LCD screen there but

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:03.050 
scratch up my Maya LCD screen there but
so<00:04:00.690> I<00:04:00.750> slid<00:04:01.019> it<00:04:01.109> on<00:04:01.230> there<00:04:01.410> and<00:04:01.880> it<00:04:02.880> works

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
so I slid it on there and it works

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:04.580 
so I slid it on there and it works
pretty<00:04:03.239> good<00:04:03.359> let<00:04:03.900> me<00:04:03.959> switch<00:04:04.170> cameras<00:04:04.500> and

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
pretty good let me switch cameras and

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:08.030 
pretty good let me switch cameras and
we'll<00:04:04.680> take<00:04:04.799> a<00:04:04.859> look<00:04:05.070> at<00:04:05.160> it<00:04:06.560> so<00:04:07.560> here<00:04:07.739> we<00:04:07.890> are

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
we'll take a look at it so here we are

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.720 
we'll take a look at it so here we are
I've<00:04:08.250> got<00:04:08.430> my<00:04:08.640> um<00:04:08.790> Canon<00:04:09.359> 60d<00:04:09.720> out<00:04:10.170> and

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:10.730 
I've got my um Canon 60d out and

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:14.170 
I've got my um Canon 60d out and
basically<00:04:11.730> you<00:04:11.850> just<00:04:11.880> have<00:04:12.150> to<00:04:12.470> kind<00:04:13.470> of<00:04:13.560> slide

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:14.180 
basically you just have to kind of slide

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:18.440 
basically you just have to kind of slide
the<00:04:15.180> panel<00:04:15.390> in<00:04:15.780> a<00:04:15.989> little<00:04:16.289> bit<00:04:16.729> turn<00:04:17.729> this<00:04:17.940> over

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:18.450 
the panel in a little bit turn this over

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:22.279 
the panel in a little bit turn this over
and<00:04:19.010> then<00:04:20.150> pull<00:04:21.150> the<00:04:21.390> panel<00:04:21.750> out<00:04:21.959> the<00:04:22.080> other

00:04:22.279 --> 00:04:22.289 
and then pull the panel out the other

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:26.250 
and then pull the panel out the other
side<00:04:23.510> and<00:04:24.510> there<00:04:25.200> you<00:04:25.289> go<00:04:25.470> it

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:26.260 
side and there you go it

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:30.650 
side and there you go it
it's<00:04:27.300> nice<00:04:28.300> and<00:04:28.330> snug<00:04:28.750> over<00:04:29.140> the<00:04:29.260> back<00:04:29.410> there

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:30.660 
it's nice and snug over the back there

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:33.300 
it's nice and snug over the back there
it's<00:04:31.660> important<00:04:32.170> to<00:04:32.230> actually<00:04:32.680> keep<00:04:33.010> this

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:33.310 
it's important to actually keep this

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:35.250 
it's important to actually keep this
elastic<00:04:34.000> when<00:04:34.150> you<00:04:34.300> staple<00:04:34.720> it<00:04:34.810> on<00:04:34.930> there<00:04:35.110> to

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:35.260 
elastic when you staple it on there to

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:36.510 
elastic when you staple it on there to
make<00:04:35.440> sure<00:04:35.470> that<00:04:35.740> it's<00:04:35.890> nice<00:04:36.130> and<00:04:36.370> snug

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:36.520 
make sure that it's nice and snug

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:38.520 
make sure that it's nice and snug
because<00:04:36.880> if<00:04:37.300> it's<00:04:37.480> too<00:04:37.630> loose<00:04:37.840> obviously<00:04:38.350> it

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:38.530 
because if it's too loose obviously it

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:43.500 
because if it's too loose obviously it
won't<00:04:38.920> stay<00:04:39.250> on<00:04:39.960> but<00:04:41.010> there<00:04:42.010> you<00:04:42.130> go<00:04:42.420> so<00:04:43.420> the

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:43.510 
won't stay on but there you go so the

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:45.120 
won't stay on but there you go so the
one<00:04:43.660> thing<00:04:43.810> that<00:04:43.870> I<00:04:43.990> like<00:04:44.200> about<00:04:44.350> this<00:04:44.680> um<00:04:44.920> as<00:04:45.100> a

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:45.130 
one thing that I like about this um as a

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:46.590 
one thing that I like about this um as a
videographer<00:04:45.850> and<00:04:45.880> the<00:04:46.210> thing<00:04:46.360> I<00:04:46.420> love<00:04:46.570> about

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:46.600

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:49.230 
videographer and the thing I love about
the<00:04:46.900> 60d<00:04:47.380> with<00:04:47.560> the<00:04:47.650> articulating<00:04:48.370> LCD<00:04:48.490> screen

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:49.240 
the 60d with the articulating LCD screen

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:51.660 
the 60d with the articulating LCD screen
is<00:04:49.420> that<00:04:49.570> I<00:04:49.660> get<00:04:49.810> to<00:04:49.900> get<00:04:50.020> all<00:04:50.200> sorts<00:04:50.500> of<00:04:50.710> really

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:51.670 
is that I get to get all sorts of really

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:53.730 
is that I get to get all sorts of really
kind<00:04:51.940> of<00:04:52.030> low<00:04:52.270> angle<00:04:52.750> shots<00:04:53.050> and<00:04:53.350> things<00:04:53.560> like

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:53.740 
kind of low angle shots and things like

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:55.140 
kind of low angle shots and things like
that<00:04:53.800> and<00:04:54.430> if<00:04:54.580> you're<00:04:54.700> using<00:04:54.880> the<00:04:55.000> rubber

that and if you're using the rubber

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:56.970 
that and if you're using the rubber
bands<00:04:55.480> across<00:04:55.990> the<00:04:56.170> front<00:04:56.440> here<00:04:56.620> and<00:04:56.830> across

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:56.980 
bands across the front here and across

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:59.760 
bands across the front here and across
the<00:04:57.070> bottom<00:04:57.550> you<00:04:58.330> you<00:04:58.840> don't<00:04:58.990> get<00:04:59.050> to<00:04:59.140> use<00:04:59.170> the

00:04:59.760 --> 00:04:59.770 
the bottom you you don't get to use the

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:01.770 
the bottom you you don't get to use the
screen<00:05:00.100> yeah<00:05:00.580> you<00:05:00.850> kind<00:05:01.090> of<00:05:01.120> have<00:05:01.270> to<00:05:01.300> keep

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:01.780 
screen yeah you kind of have to keep

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:05.460 
screen yeah you kind of have to keep
shooting<00:05:02.470> straight<00:05:02.770> here<00:05:03.070> so<00:05:03.580> with<00:05:04.090> this<00:05:04.470> you

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:05.470 
shooting straight here so with this you

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:06.900 
shooting straight here so with this you
get<00:05:05.560> to<00:05:05.680> pull<00:05:05.830> the<00:05:05.920> articulating<00:05:06.460> screen<00:05:06.610> out

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:06.910 
get to pull the articulating screen out

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:09.480 
get to pull the articulating screen out
to<00:05:07.060> the<00:05:07.150> side<00:05:07.360> and<00:05:07.780> get<00:05:08.080> all<00:05:08.260> sorts<00:05:08.560> of<00:05:08.650> crazy

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:09.490 
to the side and get all sorts of crazy

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:12.330 
to the side and get all sorts of crazy
angles<00:05:10.000> with<00:05:10.210> it<00:05:10.420> as<00:05:10.630> why<00:05:10.900> I<00:05:10.930> like<00:05:11.260> it<00:05:11.290> you<00:05:12.190> can

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:12.340 
angles with it as why I like it you can

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:17.220 
angles with it as why I like it you can
still<00:05:12.580> use<00:05:12.820> it<00:05:13.470> flat<00:05:14.470> up<00:05:14.710> it<00:05:15.370> does<00:05:16.230> protrude

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:17.230 
still use it flat up it does protrude

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:21.750 
still use it flat up it does protrude
just<00:05:17.620> a<00:05:17.770> little<00:05:18.220> bit<00:05:18.720> here<00:05:19.720> but<00:05:20.350> really<00:05:21.160> it's

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:21.760 
just a little bit here but really it's

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:22.860 
just a little bit here but really it's
not<00:05:21.940> that<00:05:22.000> big<00:05:22.330> of<00:05:22.360> a<00:05:22.480> deal

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:22.870 
not that big of a deal

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:26.160 
not that big of a deal
so<00:05:23.190> there<00:05:24.190> you<00:05:24.220> go<00:05:24.490> big<00:05:25.060> things<00:05:25.360> to<00:05:25.660> not<00:05:25.870> top

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:26.170 
so there you go big things to not top

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:30.200 
so there you go big things to not top
and<00:05:26.470> of<00:05:26.560> course<00:05:26.860> dave<00:05:27.370> dugdale<00:05:28.170> great<00:05:29.170> idea

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:30.210 
and of course dave dugdale great idea

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:34.710 
and of course dave dugdale great idea
really<00:05:31.210> simple<00:05:31.810> easy<00:05:32.080> to<00:05:32.800> do<00:05:32.980> and<00:05:33.720> works

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:34.720
