00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.330
 well it humiliates him mocks I hope that 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.549
 you 're well we end up 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.440
 today for a video tips on 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:09.750
 how to achieve a strong ice effect 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.509
 really realistic so I'm doing this 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.519
 video following the publication of some 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:15.929
 photos on g instinct and people 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.199
 actually asked me how I was doing 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:21.420
 to have a nice icing effect 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.980
 realistic so I decided to make you 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.180
 this video to show you how 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.310
 do you go see what you need 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.150
 quite a few things and that's 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.769
 pretty simple things 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.929
 so then you will be able to 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.520
 to make very beautiful icing on 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.110
 any other cake 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.760
 delicacies and especially people see 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.320
 pass the list of material so 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.180
 about a product I'm applying 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.890
 to make icing sugar facts 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.059
 realism then you will see that this is 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.059
 something that you 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.230
 do not wait at all I know well 

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:47.850
 about who will go to me 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.460
 necessarily put comments I feel 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.710
 from here we can not put any 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.390
 food products if you want to sell 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.649
 his creations and well yes know that 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.480
 it's true we could not 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.039
 use for example more she or the 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.650
 flour on your creations if you 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.990
 want 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:03.370
 it's forbidden by law so he goes 

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:06.670
 have to think of something else style 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:08.440
 of alc or else so this product so so 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:10.840
 it's a powder that comes from lush 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:12.610
 here it is that he does not lie the use 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:15.250
 first of this kind of products but hey 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:17.830
 I did not really find that great 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:19.950
 utility to put powder on the 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:22.660
 body so suddenly and well come quickly 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.180
 replaced by us for them rather for 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:26.530
 the creative leisure and it really makes a 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:27.850
 little wind now that she is the 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:29.860
 only court is yet there is not going down 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:32.590
 not fast at all and so she only serves 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:34.060
 to close icing sugar effect she is 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:35.920
 perfumed with vanilla so we know 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.320
 very well in vettel generally 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:41.400
 that uses and see them it gives a 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:43.690
 very nice effect even on creations 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:46.690
 so then we will talk about derby 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:48.280
 since it's still a good product 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:50.530
 volatile and we will suppose to 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:52.479
 associate it with a tendency to fly in all 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.500
 the senses I advise not to sneeze to 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:56.500
 side of icing sugar 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:58.930
 so you'll need nail polish and 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:02.229
 varnish if possible applicable either 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:03.659
 spray either by applicators that 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:07.140
 calls lipszyc 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:08.849
 either you use good polish so 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.470
 then I will not varnish is 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:12.120
 really good I advise you to 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.319
 take the matte polish why because 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.879
 the creations we usually do 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:16.650
 gluttony are not brilliant 

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:18.120
 if you still want something 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.010
 from brilliant my first lady seeing it 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.290
 that it's very healthy me I think especially 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.469
 the matte varnish works well it sticks well 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.700
 sure everything 

00:02:23.469 --> 00:02:27.079
 icing sugar effect without making easter 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.180
 especially prospecting it would 

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:31.489
 really very ugly and you do that 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.980
 allows to hold a little bit more and 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:34.690
 you will see that 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:36.069
 it will take two layers I will not 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:38.709
 not be able to do it here because 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:40.420
 let it dry a little while but it 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:42.519
 you will need two layers when you 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:46.629
 would like to apply this kind of 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:48.970
 technical otherwise what I had done and 

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:51.610
 some time I had bought this kind 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:53.800
 small spray of angola this 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:56.590
 kind of titles that were done everywhere 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:57.850
 and then it's for the less sweet epiq 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.910
 but in fact I see them all ready 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:03.740
 for that inside it's polish 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:04.940
 fimo maths and that's it 

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:06.380
 wait until I did not know how to do it 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:08.450
 and I would tell you that my studio not 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:09.860
 which I did not like so I put there 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:12.050
 in and they serve me time in 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:13.220
 time on occasion that's it can 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:17.120
 also serve for this guy 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:19.010
 of use so to finish then 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:21.110
 you will need a very specific tool 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:23.570
 that maybe you have at home 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:26.120
 besides, that's it if you want it 

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:28.400
 stung to your mother ask him before or 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:30.350
 buy shining another since that's 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.690
 soon Mother's Day is this 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:33.950
 so a little tea ball and you 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:36.200
 see that it's super convenient 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:37.310
 so obviously there those who are there 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.720
 know a pastry bun 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:41.570
 agree yes finally it comes from there built 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:43.310
 would be what actually it just 

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:45.080
 watch a little bit of videos from 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:47.480
 pastry chefs or people who is going to be 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:49.490
 a lot of cakes so we will prepare 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:52.160
 our tea ball that is going to be our 

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:54.110
 happy powdered with icing sugar so 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:56.000
 I put my laundry is here to protect 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:58.520
 their fingers will not prevent me from going 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.130
 badly of time to remove the powder so 

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:03.200
 you will take your talent that 

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:04.640
 your flour what you want your 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:06.560
 powder in any case must they be 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:08.810
 as fine as flour 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:13.010
 we will then take our tea ball 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:14.450
 we will therefore open the one paid attention 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:17.780
 could still pinch at the voted 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:18.980
 what and we will come to pour a whole 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:20.630
 little bit there is no need to 

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:23.480
 put a ton and fill the 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:24.980
 faking took my fit me so this is a 

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:27.290
 very simple muffin that I had made 

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:30.050
 some time ago and we will come 

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:31.550
 the varnish with the wii matte varnish that is 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:32.810
 really a very good bomb varnish 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:34.070
 you will see that it is much more 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:36.170
 simple that a polish we take 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:40.430
 would not apply to the brush so I'm going 

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:42.080
 apply a little varnish not the 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:43.210
 to give back a sum is 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:47.630
 then we will come 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:49.610
 sprinkle our kopecky 

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:52.130
 so with the tea ball so I take 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:53.990
 the tea ball take manna from 

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:55.610
 prefect rey and we will come give 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:05:00.400
 a few taps on the top 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:05:00.400
 to place ourselves our key 

00:05:01.689 --> 00:05:04.139
 here 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:08.949
 this way we get a broadcast 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:11.580
 uniform but we will be able to classify 

00:05:08.949 --> 00:05:13.979
 our cake realistically 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:16.770
 so if you see that you put a 

00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:19.199
 little bit of icing sugar like here 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:21.900
 it does not matter we will come on our 

00:05:19.199 --> 00:05:26.310
 linen is and we will pat everything 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:28.229
 gently to remove the excess which 

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:30.240
 will not stick to the varnish will 

00:05:28.229 --> 00:05:32.879
 obviously leave and you 

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:34.830
 find with a cupcake perfectly 

00:05:32.879 --> 00:05:37.020
 icy and well here's my guillemot this 

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:38.430
