00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 so hello dear minecraft friends today 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:07.470
 I'll show you the fast and 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.940
 short video as he vsv the 10.1 shader 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.710
 much smoother in your simplicity 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:14.130
 computer you get look at me 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:17.250
 okay i just got eleven ps 10 fps new 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.690
 apps and what exactly as an extra 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.980
 fast so you can now 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:25.109
 everything you look at makes it easy then 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:26.580
 on break that is just now 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:30.199
 nothing makes simple structure but 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.199
 you can watch the whole thing 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.740
 then we come to the most important ones 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.320
 then you have to look there 

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:51.720
 can you get in a lot of fps ? 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:55.380
 dollar still so if you 're on it 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:01:00.330
 So I'll show you one now 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:05.309
 attitude if you are a very bad one 

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:07.170
 Graphics then testify as well there now 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.120
 just through the recording program constant 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.150
 30 fps but that is standard because 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:13.350
 by march on the program 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:15.560
 it is no longer allowed anyway 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:20.580
 normally I would now have 81 ps 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:23.160
 then we do it for those where 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:30.810
 a bit better graphics card moves 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:32.490
 Although now times and since I have 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:43.050
 also 30 fps 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:44.220
 So it's very fluid then 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:49.740
 we can do it again times and day 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:52.409
 make it so to me during the day but at the 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:55.320
 vsv 10.1 shader me a bit 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:57.600
 it is exciting that we probably 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.070
 Already the fps notes go clearly in 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.740
 the cellar if you are in front of water 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:04.619
 Well, that's not so strong either 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.750
 but you go down will you 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:09.780
 probably remember 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:10.290
 but what do you want to do not have 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.920
 so bad 

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:15.590
 you can forgive the song shelter 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:18.299
 no problem 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:23.580
 so and now I show you again what 

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:26.310
 it makes a big difference yes me 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.110
 Just tell it so you have it now 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.130
 here 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:30.630
 so you realize it is already 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:36.450
 much slower to click and one 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:38.430
 gets along much easier 30 fps 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.950
 with recording program is normal 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:44.910
 because I'm recording right now and that 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:48.090
 recording program then only at 30 fps 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:53.799
 that's 80 fps for me 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:57.549
 Everything tests for that are now 

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:57.549
 550 ps yes yes 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:14.290
 lasting 30 fps 17 ff where I am 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:15.430
 a bit better graphics card there 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:17.739
 I could play that too 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:19.709
 make me happy that now not so 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:23.680
 blurred so only unify the blur 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:31.980
 so already as swallow 11 fps 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:31.980
 until 10 sa panama now the 87 ff 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:40.090
 and so on then better completely 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:41.799
 turn off but shader runs smoothly 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:42.940
 could now be one of the energy 

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:45.459
 for example, save on standing take 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:48.040
 the kula shaker so the churer skull 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:51.280
 runs without me also on 1000 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:53.519
 50 fps is a very strong shader 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:56.620
 now this one 

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:59.430
 You can do it that way too 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:01.420
 so much better now 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:04.120
 I do not like something very good 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:06.910
 students then look and what else I have 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:10.090
 must note that is an ultimately pc 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:11.530
 So I have the data in the 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:17.160
 description 1 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:20.139
 But it's not my best pc 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:22.180
 but only my display area i 

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:25.570
 my good pc not so full of trash 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:27.250
 because I have a lot with the game pc 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:37.330
 very many fps on highest 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:41.460
 Graphics settings say so okay because 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:44.860
 honestly i know espa cash and 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:48.360
 Handy again and I have one 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:48.360
 better than a haudrauf
