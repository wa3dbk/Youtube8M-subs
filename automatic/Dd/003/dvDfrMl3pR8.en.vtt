notice<00:01:46.909> about<00:01:47.030> the<00:01:47.329> speaker<00:01:47.659> is<00:01:47.810> the<00:01:48.079> way<00:01:48.770> the

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
notice about the speaker is the way the

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.399 
notice about the speaker is the way the
woofer<00:01:49.189> and<00:01:49.219> tweeter<00:01:49.369> z'<00:01:49.640> are<00:01:49.939> positioned<00:01:50.509> you

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:51.409 
woofer and tweeter z' are positioned you

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:52.959 
woofer and tweeter z' are positioned you
got<00:01:51.530> a<00:01:51.560> wolf<00:01:51.829> or<00:01:51.920> a<00:01:51.979> tweeter<00:01:52.310> firing<00:01:52.789> in<00:01:52.880> this

00:01:52.959 --> 00:01:52.969 
got a wolf or a tweeter firing in this

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:54.669 
got a wolf or a tweeter firing in this
direction<00:01:53.179> and<00:01:53.689> you<00:01:53.840> also<00:01:53.990> have<00:01:54.259> a<00:01:54.289> looker

00:01:54.669 --> 00:01:54.679 
direction and you also have a looker

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:57.219 
direction and you also have a looker
tweeter<00:01:54.979> firing<00:01:55.429> in<00:01:55.579> that<00:01:55.729> direction<00:01:56.229> this

00:01:57.219 --> 00:01:57.229 
tweeter firing in that direction this

00:01:57.229 --> 00:01:58.809 
tweeter firing in that direction this
setting<00:01:57.649> this<00:01:57.740> particular<00:01:58.189> setup<00:01:58.429> is<00:01:58.579> going

00:01:58.809 --> 00:01:58.819 
setting this particular setup is going

00:01:58.819 --> 00:02:00.399 
setting this particular setup is going
to<00:01:58.880> really<00:01:59.270> enhance<00:01:59.450> some<00:01:59.929> of<00:02:00.020> the<00:02:00.079> modes<00:02:00.229> that

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:00.409 
to really enhance some of the modes that

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:01.990 
to really enhance some of the modes that
we<00:02:00.500> have<00:02:00.710> available<00:02:00.950> on<00:02:01.340> the<00:02:01.490> speaker<00:02:01.850> the

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.000 
we have available on the speaker the

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.209 
we have available on the speaker the
fire<00:02:02.210> pole<00:02:02.479> mode<00:02:02.659> the<00:02:03.200> dipole<00:02:03.679> mode<00:02:03.860> and<00:02:04.130> the

00:02:04.209 --> 00:02:04.219 
fire pole mode the dipole mode and the

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:06.850 
fire pole mode the dipole mode and the
cue<00:02:04.429> effects<00:02:04.759> mode<00:02:04.969> so<00:02:05.899> a<00:02:05.929> question<00:02:06.439> why<00:02:06.649> use

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:06.860 
cue effects mode so a question why use

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:08.740 
cue effects mode so a question why use
this<00:02:07.009> speaker<00:02:07.340> over<00:02:07.610> a<00:02:07.640> you<00:02:07.939> know<00:02:08.060> named<00:02:08.269> 7mt

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
or mt6 or an MTA now let's talk about

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:12.789 
or mt6 or an MTA now let's talk about
some<00:02:11.750> of<00:02:11.780> the<00:02:11.900> features<00:02:12.200> of<00:02:12.230> how<00:02:12.410> this<00:02:12.590> can

00:02:12.789 --> 00:02:12.799 
some of the features of how this can

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:15.009 
some of the features of how this can
enhance<00:02:12.950> your<00:02:13.340> listening<00:02:13.670> area<00:02:14.000> may<00:02:14.750> be<00:02:14.780> able

to work for when your applications so
the<00:02:17.120> first<00:02:17.329> one<00:02:17.540> we<00:02:17.690> want<00:02:17.810> to<00:02:17.959> talk<00:02:18.110> about<00:02:18.170> is

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
the first one we want to talk about is

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.620 
the first one we want to talk about is
going<00:02:18.590> to<00:02:18.650> be<00:02:18.769> the<00:02:18.890> viable<00:02:19.340> mode<00:02:19.549> what<00:02:20.480> this

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 
going to be the viable mode what this

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:22.150 
going to be the viable mode what this
mode<00:02:20.840> does<00:02:20.870> is<00:02:21.079> actually<00:02:21.410> creates<00:02:21.829> a<00:02:21.920> really

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
mode does is actually creates a really

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.729 
mode does is actually creates a really
diffused<00:02:22.610> listening<00:02:23.299> area<00:02:23.540> the<00:02:24.410> woofer<00:02:24.709> and

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:24.739 
diffused listening area the woofer and

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:26.620 
diffused listening area the woofer and

working<00:02:28.040> together<00:02:28.220> pushing<00:02:29.030> the<00:02:29.239> sound

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
working together pushing the sound

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:31.089 
working together pushing the sound
around<00:02:29.599> the<00:02:29.900> listener<00:02:30.110> rather<00:02:30.470> than<00:02:30.739> directly

00:02:31.089 --> 00:02:31.099 
around the listener rather than directly

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:33.880 
around the listener rather than directly
at<00:02:31.340> the<00:02:31.489> listener<00:02:31.849> really<00:02:32.480> awesome<00:02:32.870> for<00:02:33.140> you

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
at the listener really awesome for you

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:35.170 
at the listener really awesome for you
know<00:02:33.980> surround<00:02:34.400> sound<00:02:34.640> settings<00:02:34.970> where<00:02:35.150> you

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
know surround sound settings where you

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:36.520 
know surround sound settings where you
want<00:02:35.480> to<00:02:35.569> be<00:02:35.660> in<00:02:35.750> the<00:02:35.840> middle<00:02:36.140> of<00:02:36.230> the<00:02:36.380> movie

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
want to be in the middle of the movie

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:38.530 
want to be in the middle of the movie
this<00:02:36.829> is<00:02:37.010> really<00:02:37.220> going<00:02:37.340> to<00:02:37.430> create<00:02:37.670> that<00:02:37.910> now

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
this is really going to create that now

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.569 
this is really going to create that now
if<00:02:38.690> we<00:02:38.840> change<00:02:39.079> it<00:02:39.230> to<00:02:39.319> a<00:02:39.349> dipole<00:02:39.620> mode<00:02:40.040> the

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:40.579 
if we change it to a dipole mode the

00:02:40.579 --> 00:02:42.490 
if we change it to a dipole mode the
dipole<00:02:41.000> mode<00:02:41.150> is<00:02:41.269> actually<00:02:41.930> enhancing<00:02:42.319> it<00:02:42.440> a

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
dipole mode is actually enhancing it a

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:43.930 
dipole mode is actually enhancing it a
little<00:02:42.650> more<00:02:42.890> it's<00:02:43.160> giving<00:02:43.400> us<00:02:43.519> more<00:02:43.700> good

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:43.940 
little more it's giving us more good

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:46.360 
little more it's giving us more good
just<00:02:44.090> a<00:02:44.390> few<00:02:44.629> sound<00:02:44.900> and<00:02:45.200> really<00:02:45.799> broadening

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
just a few sound and really broadening

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.430 
just a few sound and really broadening
the<00:02:46.489> listening<00:02:46.879> area<00:02:47.030> so<00:02:47.360> again<00:02:48.079> it's<00:02:48.230> really

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
the listening area so again it's really

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.170 
the listening area so again it's really
enhancing<00:02:49.010> the<00:02:49.370> environment<00:02:49.940> that<00:02:50.060> you're

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
enhancing the environment that you're

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.090 
enhancing the environment that you're
hearing<00:02:50.329> the<00:02:50.959> audio<00:02:51.260> coming<00:02:51.560> from<00:02:51.590> whether

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:52.100 
hearing the audio coming from whether

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.370 
hearing the audio coming from whether
it's<00:02:52.280> music<00:02:52.819> or<00:02:53.209> movies<00:02:53.389> or<00:02:53.600> what<00:02:54.079> happens

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:54.380 
it's music or movies or what happens

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:55.750 
it's music or movies or what happens
it's<00:02:54.500> really<00:02:54.530> going<00:02:54.799> to<00:02:54.889> enhance<00:02:55.010> the

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 
it's really going to enhance the

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:59.050 
it's really going to enhance the
atmosphere<00:02:56.139> now<00:02:57.139> the<00:02:57.430> last<00:02:58.430> mode<00:02:58.700> we<00:02:58.819> have<00:02:58.940> is

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
atmosphere now the last mode we have is

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.120 
atmosphere now the last mode we have is
acute<00:02:59.359> effects<00:02:59.600> mode<00:02:59.810> this<00:03:00.440> mode<00:03:00.620> is<00:03:00.799> giving

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.130 
acute effects mode this mode is giving

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:03.699 
acute effects mode this mode is giving
us<00:03:01.250> at<00:03:01.430> the<00:03:01.700> best<00:03:02.000> of<00:03:02.150> both<00:03:02.329> both<00:03:02.750> worlds<00:03:03.230> the

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:03.709 
us at the best of both both worlds the

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:05.830 
us at the best of both both worlds the
bipolar<00:03:04.310> pole<00:03:04.760> and<00:03:05.090> actually<00:03:05.420> giving<00:03:05.569> us<00:03:05.720> a

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 
bipolar pole and actually giving us a

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.870 
bipolar pole and actually giving us a
lot<00:03:05.959> more<00:03:06.139> low-end<00:03:06.290> so<00:03:06.799> now<00:03:07.340> try<00:03:07.609> it<00:03:07.670> out<00:03:07.790> in

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:07.880 
lot more low-end so now try it out in

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:09.099 
lot more low-end so now try it out in
your<00:03:07.970> application<00:03:08.420> and<00:03:08.540> see<00:03:08.630> if<00:03:08.750> you<00:03:08.840> like<00:03:08.959> the

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:09.109 
your application and see if you like the
