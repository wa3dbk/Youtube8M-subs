00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.190
 so hey german mecom to a new one 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.319
 video here on max fps channel i am 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.880
 Although not the max eyth for the more 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:10.380
 stands and today I will give you times 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.259
 a little something to battlefield 3 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.750
 bring and he said talk about it 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:18.240
 why you should still play the game 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.369
 speak possible long-term motivations 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.170
 are today's topic but I want to 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.880
 to throw in again for all those 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.529
 wonder why I'm here at all 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.689
 if we were the max me 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.130
 invited this little showcase 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.689
 to make video and I will be you 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.149
 just show a little bit or 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.460
 give a little insight what 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.680
 usually on my channel 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.809
 My little one is going around 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.730
 Battlefield 3 and accordingly much 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.110
 I've already been looking for the difficult one 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.420
 corresponds since the release of 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.850
 Battlefield 3 Whats number one and a half 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:51.000
 years ago is some time in the country 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.260
 passed or in bellevue 3 in the case 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.390
 and then you already have to 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.340
 partly wonder why I play 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.500
 That still or how can I play the game for 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.210
 make me more interesting with it 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.680
 not so boring is just for 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.330
 the people already by now 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:07.140
 Rank 144 or kÃ¶rdel 100 are talking 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.820
 maximum level in battlefield 3 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.130
 have reached there is this 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.810
 rather ask because usually the 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.270
 main reason why I'm such a multiplayer 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.909
 first person shooter game games is now 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.009
 just like that the ranking system I say 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.840
 wants to be the highest level in order to 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.460
 show that I played and properly 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:27.299
 if you have this already 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.950
 premier goal has reached 145 levels 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.780
 then you might want to go too 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.610
 bring in a bit of life because 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.680
 now and then the motivation has flutes 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.090
 So why should I go bellevue? 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.720
 play three if I already 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.490
 all has 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.720
 and there comes the first thing 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.220
 what I should suggest to you 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.770
 So I do not know if you already know that 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.899
 but made 500 kills per weapon 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.820
 just about all the essays 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.500
 unlock or dog 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.759
 unlock those tags for this 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.680
 weapons are available 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:54.750
 that was a thing for me, for example 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.430
 think that kba has suggested me as 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.380
 it was about the topic and I have to be real 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.329
 say that's a cool thing because of that 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.040
 you do not just play with all weapons 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:04.530
 but really has everything free 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.750
 connected say can in each 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.560
 situation always his perfect weapon 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.239
 Find 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.410
 I also have in my own video 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:12.239
 ever said that it always 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.250
 boring is with the same weapon 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:16.860
 play or something but yes there is me 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:19.950
 people who are partially with their 16 or 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.959
 ipad only or speak exclusively 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.190
 play and for the people I put 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:25.739
 but a little more heartfelt 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:28.650
 to test other weapons than straight 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:31.019
 if you are with your 500 600 700 hours 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:33.450
 only three or four top weapons left 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:35.430
 with more than 1,000 kills from then it is 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.810
 right on time a few new ones 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.730
 to test weapons 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:39.989
 another point but where you really 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.480
 ever have to play a bit more 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:44.549
 just to get a thing these are 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.950
 for example the vehicle but text because 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:48.630
 because you get a super cool the optics 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:51.330
 that it is at least on the ground and so on 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:52.739
 that she does not look nice and shows too 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:54.450
 The people just that you a lot 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:56.280
 has played or is alba 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:59.250
 So has it are for example 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:01.349
 jet service there 100 dog tags these things 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:03.810
 to obtain accordingly stop 

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:05.489
 100 service saas and that can be done 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:07.980
 for a while, for example, here 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:09.780
 people pslv dog have the thing too 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:12.359
 already get it because they are simple 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:13.739
 super much and can fly Great 

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:15.600
 I mean who ever against helper 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:17.489
 and, for example, he flew white 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:19.950
 as that usually ends in 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:22.079
 puncto dog tags themselves a long term 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:22.440
 Setting goals can be quite interesting 

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:24.569
 his 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:26.609
 Unfortunately, there is this dog text breaks 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:28.500
 These golden things do not even look that way 

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:31.200
 Often I think that is really only for 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.880
 for example, by the name of but you have 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.069
 rather less here in battlefield 3 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.959
 at least no official one 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:39.209
 give this de and then stop too 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:41.010
 even these vehicles and not too 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:42.450
 forget when the trend gets 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.680
 it is synonymous but it has somehow 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:46.260
 less to do with the challenge 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:48.299
 at least playfully in the big and 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:50.760
 So there is not even anything at all 

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:52.769
 so many of these beautiful golden of 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:54.630
 Children's dog tags which are very long 

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:56.220
 need to unlock them 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:58.829
 that's why I would be very happy 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:01.170
 if, for example, in bathrooms like four new jobs 

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:03.329
 so much more dog tags are added 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:05.040
 which take longer to free them 

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:06.959
 switch because currently are very much 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:09.450
 many of them after about three 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:11.639
 matches or so has enabled and 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:13.620
 that, of course, it's less likely 

00:04:11.639 --> 00:04:15.290
 long-term motivation connected 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:17.570
 there are challenges 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:19.459
 not visually perceive at least not 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:21.440
 in the game speaks if you apply someone 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:22.820
 then that's the way work changes 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:25.550
 not really a thing you have no 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:27.110
 weapons camouflage or no special dr 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:29.030
 in principle , these are these 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:32.720
 challenges can be seen also Battlelog 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:34.759
 Say scruples and kd are saying yes 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:36.680
 and I have to tell you things like that 

00:04:34.759 --> 00:04:39.020
 It can be a bit frustrating 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:40.789
 just because you just less of these 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:42.470
 you get back after that 

00:04:40.789 --> 00:04:45.229
 often desirable just when you have a lot 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:47.030
 Who invests time in a game? 

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:48.710
 example, his head in the height 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:50.570
 wants to shoot the players on 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:51.889
 best only if it somehow stops 

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:53.210
 to be there properly 

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:55.490
 Of course 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:56.930
 or you go on metro course borders and 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:59.030
 so on and so on there you should 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:01.130
 his scope minute already something in 

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:03.080
 The height can also drift 

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:04.910
 new public event this is now in the 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:07.669
 next month and the whole thing will be 

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:08.210
 Almost 100 hours speak for four days 

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:10.880
 his 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:12.650
 Somehow it has to improve his kg 

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:14.690
 you have to be a little bit more on yourself 

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:16.340
 really a relatively good stop 

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:19.130
 At least you have to be a player 

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:20.870
 stop improving to increase his kd 

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:22.880
 Say if I now for example the 

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:24.169
 all the time just out of the corner 

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:26.000
 Run out even when I'm out 

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:28.310
 I'll be shot if I am 

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.020
 of course it is clear if I am 

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:32.330
 but now my perception in the game 

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:34.550
 Improve for example a topic in 

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:37.130
 will be one of my next video 

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:39.860
 then you can change your playing style or rather 

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:42.080
 said his successes to his choir and 

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:44.300
 as far as he can improve a lot 

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:45.710
 or better said, to improve a lot 

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:48.229
 I do not want to get into it too much right now 

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:50.479
 theme of psyche and attitude and 

00:05:48.229 --> 00:05:52.370
 So what's going in there when you go 

00:05:50.479 --> 00:05:53.750
 Battlefield 3 pulled but I believe her 

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:55.190
 You have often noticed that yourself 

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:57.139
 when coming home and totally 

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:58.940
 and then first a round 

00:05:57.139 --> 00:06:00.949
 battlefield comes to a close then it will be in the 

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:03.260
 Do not believe so well as you do 

00:06:00.949 --> 00:06:05.210
 just relax in the evening again for a 

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:06.949
 a few rounds with all friends 

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:08.539
 I gambles together would be very 

00:06:06.949 --> 00:06:10.849
 happy if I have your 

00:06:08.539 --> 00:06:13.280
 long-term motivation to battlefield 

00:06:10.849 --> 00:06:15.320
 3 shares or just tells you why 

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:17.599
 every game I still pulled mine 

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:20.690
 it can be that you also once from 

00:06:17.599 --> 00:06:22.759
 this level 145 all weapons camouflage 

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:24.500
 or weapons etta james unlocked 

00:06:22.759 --> 00:06:24.820
 has and so on and so forth what is 

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:26.560
 then 

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:28.330
 the reason why you play the game 

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:30.610
 still leave me in the comments and 

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:32.590
 he know we're here only once at the end 

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:33.670
 From the video me personally has really fun 

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:35.680
 made a little bit about it 

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:37.870
 to think what my own 

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:39.370
 Long term motivation is the whole thing 

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:41.020
 gamble at all because balls are a lot 

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:43.180
 beer just comes in the next one 

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:44.890
 months do not look like we said we are on 

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:46.270
 end of the video I'll say here first 

00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:48.960
 thanks to see you and hopefully see you soon 

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:48.960
 next time
