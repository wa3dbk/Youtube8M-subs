then control each merge layers and then
ctrl<00:02:30.920> J<00:02:31.220> again<00:02:31.610> and<00:02:32.000> this<00:02:32.420> time<00:02:32.480> we're<00:02:32.810> going

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
ctrl J again and this time we're going

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:35.740 
ctrl J again and this time we're going
to<00:02:32.990> flip<00:02:33.200> vertically<00:02:33.770> and<00:02:34.330> then<00:02:35.330> you<00:02:35.450> want<00:02:35.660> to

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
to flip vertically and then you want to

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:38.320 
to flip vertically and then you want to
make<00:02:35.930> it<00:02:36.050> look<00:02:36.200> like<00:02:36.350> that<00:02:36.790> then<00:02:37.790> you<00:02:37.820> want<00:02:38.180> to

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.330 
make it look like that then you want to

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:41.199 
make it look like that then you want to
merge<00:02:38.690> the<00:02:38.900> layers<00:02:38.930> of<00:02:39.470> control<00:02:39.830> e<00:02:40.090> then<00:02:41.090> you

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:41.209 
merge the layers of control e then you

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:42.699 
merge the layers of control e then you
bring<00:02:41.450> that<00:02:41.600> down<00:02:41.840> a<00:02:41.900> little<00:02:42.020> bit<00:02:42.380> for<00:02:42.650> some

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:42.709 
bring that down a little bit for some

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:44.650 
bring that down a little bit for some
shine<00:02:43.070> in<00:02:43.220> the<00:02:43.310> middle<00:02:43.640> and<00:02:43.850> then<00:02:44.480> go<00:02:44.630> to

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
shine in the middle and then go to

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:46.840 
shine in the middle and then go to
filter<00:02:45.110> blur<00:02:45.170> motion<00:02:45.770> blur<00:02:46.100> but<00:02:46.490> we're<00:02:46.670> not

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:46.850 
filter blur motion blur but we're not

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:50.230 
filter blur motion blur but we're not
going<00:02:46.880> to<00:02:47.150> have<00:02:47.360> it<00:02:47.510> as<00:02:47.770> high<00:02:48.770> as<00:02:48.980> we<00:02:49.130> did<00:02:49.370> so

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:50.240 
going to have it as high as we did so

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:52.690 
going to have it as high as we did so
distance<00:02:50.840> is<00:02:50.990> still<00:02:51.230> 90<00:02:51.680> and<00:02:51.890> I<00:02:52.040> put<00:02:52.340> it<00:02:52.490> are

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
distance is still 90 and I put it are

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.520 
distance is still 90 and I put it are
the<00:02:53.120> angles<00:02:53.270> still<00:02:53.780> 90<00:02:54.110> and<00:02:54.200> I<00:02:54.230> put<00:02:54.440> the

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
the angles still 90 and I put the

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:58.210 
the angles still 90 and I put the
distance<00:02:54.890> of<00:02:55.040> 70<00:02:55.690> and<00:02:56.690> then<00:02:57.650> you<00:02:57.830> want<00:02:58.010> to<00:02:58.070> set

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
distance of 70 and then you want to set

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.910 
distance of 70 and then you want to set
that<00:02:58.370> to<00:02:58.519> overlay<00:02:59.350> and<00:03:00.350> then<00:03:00.620> you<00:03:00.709> want<00:03:00.860> to

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 
that to overlay and then you want to

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:05.949 
that to overlay and then you want to
make<00:03:01.040> a<00:03:01.070> new<00:03:01.340> layer<00:03:01.610> and<00:03:02.470> then<00:03:04.750> you<00:03:05.750> want<00:03:05.900> to

00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:05.959 
make a new layer and then you want to

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:09.100 
make a new layer and then you want to
find<00:03:06.170> the<00:03:06.350> car<00:03:06.620> you<00:03:06.830> want<00:03:07.070> take<00:03:07.820> the<00:03:08.180> paint

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:09.110 
find the car you want take the paint

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:14.440 
find the car you want take the paint
bucket<00:03:09.700> paint<00:03:10.700> over<00:03:11.120> it<00:03:11.150> um<00:03:12.100> I<00:03:13.269> usually<00:03:14.269> do

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450 
bucket paint over it um I usually do

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:17.560 
bucket paint over it um I usually do
overlay<00:03:15.050> or<00:03:15.080> soft<00:03:15.680> light<00:03:16.010> although<00:03:16.610> most

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:17.570 
overlay or soft light although most

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:21.729 
overlay or soft light although most
people<00:03:17.750> recommend<00:03:18.590> that<00:03:18.800> you<00:03:19.010> use<00:03:19.040> on<00:03:20.739> color

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:21.739 
people recommend that you use on color

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:24.670 
people recommend that you use on color
but<00:03:22.700> I<00:03:22.880> find<00:03:23.239> that<00:03:23.480> to<00:03:23.720> be<00:03:23.870> like<00:03:24.019> really<00:03:24.320> dull

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:24.680 
but I find that to be like really dull

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.000 
but I find that to be like really dull
and<00:03:25.239> boring<00:03:26.239> and<00:03:26.750> it<00:03:27.110> really<00:03:27.320> doesn't<00:03:27.530> bring

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.010 
and boring and it really doesn't bring

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:31.000 
and boring and it really doesn't bring
up<00:03:28.190> the<00:03:28.570> full<00:03:29.570> shine<00:03:30.019> if<00:03:30.320> you<00:03:30.410> have<00:03:30.530> natural

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.010 
up the full shine if you have natural

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:35.820 
up the full shine if you have natural
colors<00:03:32.230> actually<00:03:33.230> I<00:03:33.290> guess<00:03:33.440> it<00:03:33.620> does<00:03:33.800> but

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:35.830 
colors actually I guess it does but

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:39.590 
colors actually I guess it does but
these<00:03:36.830> course<00:03:37.130> not

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:39.600 
these course not

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:45.440 
these course not
so<00:03:40.600> I'll<00:03:40.930> go<00:03:41.230> with<00:03:41.470> that<00:03:41.710> no<00:03:42.640> I'm<00:03:42.820> so<00:03:43.120> different

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
so I'll go with that no I'm so different

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:48.300 
so I'll go with that no I'm so different
it's<00:03:46.450> just<00:03:46.690> a<00:03:46.810> prop<00:03:47.140> trial<00:03:47.620> and<00:03:47.860> error<00:03:48.100> to<00:03:48.190> find

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310 
it's just a prop trial and error to find

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:51.560 
it's just a prop trial and error to find
the<00:03:48.610> perfect<00:03:48.820> color<00:03:49.180> that<00:03:49.480> you<00:03:49.510> want

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:51.570 
the perfect color that you want

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:53.550 
the perfect color that you want
obviously<00:03:52.570> I<00:03:52.600> keep<00:03:52.840> on<00:03:52.990> hearing<00:03:53.020> a<00:03:53.290> lot<00:03:53.500> of

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 
obviously I keep on hearing a lot of

00:03:53.560 --> 00:04:03.720 
obviously I keep on hearing a lot of
blondes<00:03:54.310> I<00:03:54.540> don't<00:03:55.540> know<00:03:55.660> why<00:04:02.130> also<00:04:03.130> I<00:04:03.160> find

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:03.730 
blondes I don't know why also I find

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:07.230 
blondes I don't know why also I find
that<00:04:03.940> color<00:04:04.330> it<00:04:04.840> makes<00:04:05.830> it<00:04:06.040> like<00:04:06.220> so<00:04:06.910> it's<00:04:07.090> not

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:07.240 
that color it makes it like so it's not

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:09.420 
that color it makes it like so it's not
a<00:04:07.300> natural<00:04:07.900> color<00:04:08.140> could<00:04:08.590> see<00:04:08.800> that<00:04:09.040> should<00:04:09.310> be

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:09.430 
a natural color could see that should be

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:11.280 
a natural color could see that should be
like<00:04:09.580> a<00:04:09.610> dark<00:04:09.940> brown<00:04:10.150> but<00:04:10.570> it's<00:04:10.720> more<00:04:10.870> like<00:04:11.080> a

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:11.290 
like a dark brown but it's more like a

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:13.650 
like a dark brown but it's more like a
really<00:04:11.710> light<00:04:12.040> brown<00:04:12.400> and<00:04:12.760> if<00:04:13.360> you<00:04:13.450> go<00:04:13.600> to

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:13.660 
really light brown and if you go to

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:15.870 
really light brown and if you go to
overlay<00:04:14.230> or<00:04:14.260> soft<00:04:14.770> light<00:04:15.070> then<00:04:15.550> you<00:04:15.670> get<00:04:15.850> a

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:15.880 
overlay or soft light then you get a

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:21.710 
overlay or soft light then you get a
different<00:04:16.299> color<00:04:16.630> even<00:04:17.590> not<00:04:18.280> multiply<00:04:19.709> um

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:21.720 
different color even not multiply um

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:31.439 
different color even not multiply um
maybe<00:04:22.720> then<00:04:23.140> your<00:04:23.320> burn<00:04:24.090> maybe<00:04:25.090> not<00:04:27.000> hmm

00:04:31.439 --> 00:04:31.449 

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:33.779

00:04:51.899 --> 00:04:51.909 
put this on the tree viewer whoa so I

00:04:51.909 --> 00:04:57.119 
put this on the tree viewer whoa so I
set<00:04:52.180> it<00:04:52.270> to<00:04:52.300> overlay<00:04:55.710> you<00:04:56.710> have<00:04:56.830> a<00:04:56.889> lot<00:04:57.099> of

00:04:57.119 --> 00:04:57.129 
set it to overlay you have a lot of

00:04:57.129 --> 00:05:07.249 
set it to overlay you have a lot of
files<00:05:03.779> the<00:05:04.779> pre<00:05:05.259> viewer<00:05:05.560> doesn't<00:05:06.129> like<00:05:06.490> PNG

00:05:07.249 --> 00:05:07.259 
files the pre viewer doesn't like PNG

00:05:07.259 --> 00:05:11.010 
files the pre viewer doesn't like PNG
but<00:05:08.259> I<00:05:08.469> really<00:05:08.889> could<00:05:09.069> care<00:05:09.279> less<00:05:09.310> it<00:05:10.020> just

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:11.020 
but I really could care less it just

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:16.499 
but I really could care less it just
makes<00:05:11.680> it<00:05:11.889> so<00:05:12.039> you<00:05:12.849> have<00:05:13.089> to<00:05:13.449> UM<00:05:15.060> so<00:05:16.060> you<00:05:16.120> have
