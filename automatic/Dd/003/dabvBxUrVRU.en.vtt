00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:20.189
 water is much more epic than cocaine 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:22.140
 shit a lot they say that this masterpiece 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.960
 it is very overvalued and it is very bad 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.300
 quality and for God perhaps they do not see that 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.519
 well stylized are the cartoons these 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.710

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.180
 pulse and quality as the animes of

 which is water is for children or my god 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:51.239
 fairy tale is not for children and is more than 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.190
 perfect for all audiences with their 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.710
 erotic but subtle fan scenes 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.480
 service his epic battles carried with 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.640
 intelligence and without so many of ucs 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.100
 machines with their enormous abundance and 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.260
 richness of characters which you can 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.159
 identify yourself and of course your 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.380
 messages that teach us the values 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:10.450
 of friendship fellowship and about 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:12.640
 all respect so stop being some 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:14.950
 blasphemous shit saying that fairy 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:17.079
 tale is mediocre or garbage fuck if they say 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:18.789
 that's because they are subnormal of shit 

00:01:17.079 --> 00:01:21.159

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:23.590
 off-hook moms fuck fucking with 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:25.179

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.969
 have respect to those we like 

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:30.189
 the good ones are is really fuck all 

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:32.259
 they strike a fairy time as the shadow of 

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:34.270
 that adorably decent fuck of one 

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:36.250
 piece even when we all know that 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:39.380
 maybe one piece is a pirate version 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:41.899
 of dragon ball but of you 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.880
 fairytale is plagiarism from the shadow of a 

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:46.039
 shadow is fucked so he sees you tokyo 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:48.470
 I hope you regret doing a 

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:51.079
 shit like canceling fairy tale besides 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:53.450

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:14.540
 forms that I would like since in 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.760
 more than a year the sleeve of this work 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:18.200
 teacher has advanced in an atrocious way 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.060
 unrealistic in a way that 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.490
 practically my eyes cry from the 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.470
 immense happiness that they also feel in 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:26.990
 the very rare case in which the anime 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:28.790
 reach the sleeve as there is no problem 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:30.350
 that thanks to the fillings we can 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.209
 know more about all of your 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:34.250
 secondary characters of the series 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:36.920
 besides these fillings are so 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:39.230
 entertained and last very little time or 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.239
 my god is an darwin I want to see how 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:43.190

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:46.010

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:47.989

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:56.300
 best news of all 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:58.640
 Goku will have a new transformation of 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:00.440
 super sayayin but surely this will be 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.959
 much more pro than the other prick 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:04.880
 transformation in super sayayin phase 4 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:06.830

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:07.580
 transformation will be designed by the 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:09.680
 very respected 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:11.780
 akira toriyama who designed the new 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:14.030
 transformation of the most epic character 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:16.370
 of the Japanese animation also has the 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:18.380
 word god fuck but what else are you 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:20.240

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:22.220
 enormous integrity as mangaka already 

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:24.740

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:46.400
 where he stayed or we will forget 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:48.290
 of the gt trauma and maybe someday 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.450
 we can contemplate enemies 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:52.490
 ridiculously powerful in the very good 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:54.290
 meaning of the word and who knows 

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:56.209
 soon we will live long enough to 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:58.570
 contemplate in its maximum splendor the 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:04:01.400
 transformation of the super sayayin phase 

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:03.590
 25.0 good and now leaving aside my 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:05.810
 pseudo sarcasm with a synthesizer 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:07.760
 voice for weones that gives them to use a 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:10.040
 fucking microphone and talking just like 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:12.080
 subnormal in my house while my parents 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:13.300
 they see a game of overrated football 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:15.100
 all volume 

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:17.049
 Well now I will talk about video games 

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:19.030
 gringos and good for the one who half me 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:20.980
 Know well because you will know that I am a 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:22.750
 pseudo fan boy of the explode and chasm and 

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:25.390
 overrated takes off from assassin's creed 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:27.730
 Well, exactly one week ago 

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:29.530
 the trailer for the fourth part was announced 

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:31.750
 of the franchise though technically 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:33.490
 it would be the sixth part of the 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:35.710
 franchise 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:37.990
 now we will be some dogs children of his 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:40.840
 recontra fucking mother of the seven seas or 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:43.060
 be pirates in this game good not 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:45.220
 I know if I feel good considering that 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:47.680
 it's been a year since it was announced 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:49.720
 that would come assassin's creed 3 game that 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:51.970
 had one of the flattest protagonists 

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:54.550
 and bored of all the overexploited 

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:56.560
 saga I say that it is interesting to put 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:58.900
 to a serious pseudo script that despite 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:01.690
 to be in his twenties seems like a brat 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:03.490
 14-year-old pubert with emo complexes 

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:05.349
 avenger who believes blindly in the 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:07.210
 freedom of the gringos and that has 

00:05:05.349 --> 00:05:09.159
 as much or less charisma than a table 

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:11.530
 fuck and I who complained about the 

00:05:09.159 --> 00:05:13.690
 Japanese powers to overexploit their 

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:16.060
 animes sleeves when in the world of 

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:18.039
 video games do the same thing in order 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:19.090
 while that game has a gameplay 

00:05:18.039 --> 00:05:21.069
 of mother whore 

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:23.050
 a fucking story and a 

00:05:21.069 --> 00:05:25.090
 protagonist blond german martin who 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:27.009
 has more charisma than a table for 

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:29.919
 until suddenly I get the game of 

00:05:27.009 --> 00:05:31.750
 everything in the 10 years if it is not that more and 

00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:34.270
 I just hope that the game has at least 

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:36.370
 a decent final beggar that mine 

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:38.350
 almost all the assassin's finals 

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:40.840
 creed have the ends more rarely 

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:43.570
 two and unsatisfactory that never 

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:47.310
 I have seen in my humble and young life like this 

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:47.310
 Goodbye and until my next video
