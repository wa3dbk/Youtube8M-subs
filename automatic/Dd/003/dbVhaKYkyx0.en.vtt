personally I actually found myself

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:41.949 
personally I actually found myself
feeling<00:02:40.489> sick<00:02:40.940> to<00:02:41.060> my<00:02:41.180> stomach<00:02:41.209> the<00:02:41.660> first

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:41.959

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:43.459 
time I played the game because of the

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:45.610 
time I played the game because of the
moving<00:02:43.730> backgrounds<00:02:44.390> this<00:02:45.170> didn't<00:02:45.470> happen

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
moving backgrounds this didn't happen

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.320

again though when I played it the second

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:49.630 
again though when I played it the second
time<00:02:47.360> and<00:02:47.930> it's<00:02:48.410> just<00:02:48.650> really<00:02:48.950> the<00:02:49.069> nature<00:02:49.430> of

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
time and it's just really the nature of

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.570 
time and it's just really the nature of
