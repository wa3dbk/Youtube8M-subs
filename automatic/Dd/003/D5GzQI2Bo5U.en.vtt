people<00:01:28.080> had<00:01:28.229> concerns<00:01:28.770> with<00:01:29.159> a<00:01:29.189> skull

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
people had concerns with a skull

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.539 
people had concerns with a skull
originally<00:01:30.390> and<00:01:30.930> to<00:01:31.829> me<00:01:31.950> it<00:01:32.070> looks<00:01:32.250> pretty

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549

cool<00:01:32.790> I<00:01:33.090> don't<00:01:33.720> think<00:01:33.990> people<00:01:34.140> knew<00:01:34.409> that<00:01:34.439> the

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
cool I don't think people knew that the

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.580 
cool I don't think people knew that the

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:36.950 
let's take a peek here okay I'm just
kind<00:04:33.180> of<00:04:33.270> like<00:04:33.390> the<00:04:35.240> Scarlett<00:04:36.240> Johansson<00:04:36.750> body

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:36.960

kind of like the Scarlett Johansson body
but<00:04:37.200> I'm<00:04:37.320> not<00:04:37.470> sure<00:04:37.710> it<00:04:37.830> might<00:04:37.920> be<00:04:38.070> a<00:04:38.100> little<00:04:38.340> I

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:38.490
