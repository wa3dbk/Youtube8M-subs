00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:10.960 
you don't have one you set the interval

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:12.780 
you don't have one you set the interval
time<00:05:11.230> how<00:05:11.680> many<00:05:11.890> times<00:05:12.130> you<00:05:12.310> want<00:05:12.340> to<00:05:12.460> do<00:05:12.610> it

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:12.790 
time how many times you want to do it

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:15.600 
time how many times you want to do it
and<00:05:13.030> then<00:05:13.210> the<00:05:13.540> rest<00:05:13.720> period<00:05:14.230> and<00:05:14.470> it's<00:05:15.310> just

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:15.610 
and then the rest period and it's just

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:17.890 
and then the rest period and it's just
so<00:05:15.850> much<00:05:15.910> more<00:05:16.270> helpful<00:05:16.450> and<00:05:16.930> used

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:17.900
