take damage it'll increase your
adrenaline<00:02:56.220> so<00:02:56.459> that<00:02:56.610> pretty<00:02:57.030> much<00:02:57.239> you<00:02:57.300> can

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.570 
adrenaline so that pretty much you can

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:59.960 
adrenaline so that pretty much you can
kill<00:02:57.810> people<00:02:58.140> a<00:02:58.200> lot<00:02:58.380> faster<00:02:58.860> with<00:02:59.250> one<00:02:59.610> blow

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
kill people a lot faster with one blow

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.810 
kill people a lot faster with one blow
