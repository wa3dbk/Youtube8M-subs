00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
stuff on you you know so we're just

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:19.600 
stuff on you you know so we're just
gonna<00:02:13.099> add<00:02:13.190> that<00:02:13.520> to<00:02:13.580> there<00:02:18.250> we're<00:02:19.250> gonna<00:02:19.340> stir

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
gonna add that to there we're gonna stir

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:21.309 
gonna add that to there we're gonna stir
it<00:02:19.670> up<00:02:19.760> a<00:02:19.940> little<00:02:20.060> bit<00:02:20.300> see<00:02:21.080> how<00:02:21.140> it<00:02:21.200> gets

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:21.319 
it up a little bit see how it gets

it up a little bit see how it gets
cloudy<00:02:21.940> this<00:02:22.940> is<00:02:23.150> an<00:02:23.270> exothermic<00:02:23.810> reaction

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
cloudy this is an exothermic reaction

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:27.190 
cloudy this is an exothermic reaction
meaning<00:02:25.040> it<00:02:25.310> gives<00:02:25.489> off<00:02:25.690> this<00:02:26.690> is<00:02:26.840> actually

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
meaning it gives off this is actually

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.490 
meaning it gives off this is actually
kind<00:02:27.440> of<00:02:27.530> hot<00:02:27.739> where<00:02:28.489> it's<00:02:28.670> gonna<00:02:28.970> get<00:02:29.180> hot

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
kind of hot where it's gonna get hot

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.309 
kind of hot where it's gonna get hot
we're<00:02:30.500> just<00:02:30.739> going<00:02:31.040> over<00:02:31.220> there<00:02:31.520> goes<00:02:32.319> yeah

00:02:33.309 --> 00:02:33.319 
we're just going over there goes yeah

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:35.620 
we're just going over there goes yeah
this<00:02:34.130> is<00:02:34.280> going<00:02:34.459> to<00:02:34.519> get<00:02:34.640> hot<00:02:34.819> and<00:02:35.120> we're<00:02:35.510> going

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:35.630 
this is going to get hot and we're going

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:38.800 
this is going to get hot and we're going
to<00:02:35.690> let<00:02:35.810> it<00:02:35.840> sit<00:02:36.260> until<00:02:37.330> that<00:02:38.330> cloudiness

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
to let it sit until that cloudiness

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:41.590 
to let it sit until that cloudiness
dissipates<00:02:39.670> we're<00:02:40.670> going<00:02:40.940> to<00:02:41.120> prepare<00:02:41.330> our

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
get some towels to wrap this up now that

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.080 
get some towels to wrap this up now that
this<00:02:50.269> is<00:02:50.450> cleared<00:02:50.780> up<00:02:51.340> we're<00:02:52.340> just<00:02:52.370> gonna<00:02:52.549> pour

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
this is cleared up we're just gonna pour

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:57.910 
this is cleared up we're just gonna pour
it<00:02:53.959> in<00:02:54.140> there<00:02:54.380> and<00:02:54.819> let<00:02:55.819> the<00:02:55.970> heat<00:02:56.239> of<00:02:56.420> it<00:02:56.920> melt

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
it in there and let the heat of it melt

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:01.449 
it in there and let the heat of it melt
the<00:02:58.640> floor<00:02:59.360> this<00:03:00.260> is<00:03:00.470> a<00:03:00.500> heck<00:03:00.980> of<00:03:01.130> a<00:03:01.250> lot<00:03:01.400> easier

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:01.459 
the floor this is a heck of a lot easier

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:05.650 
the floor this is a heck of a lot easier
than<00:03:02.709> any<00:03:03.709> of<00:03:03.950> the<00:03:04.069> other<00:03:04.220> methods<00:03:04.730> just<00:03:05.360> sort

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.660 
than any of the other methods just sort

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:15.729 
than any of the other methods just sort
of<00:03:05.720> push<00:03:05.900> it<00:03:06.049> in<00:03:06.140> there<00:03:14.170> yeah<00:03:15.170> nothing<00:03:15.650> it

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:15.739 
of push it in there yeah nothing it

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:20.020 
of push it in there yeah nothing it
we're<00:03:16.609> gonna<00:03:16.730> do<00:03:17.030> this<00:03:18.519> with<00:03:19.519> the<00:03:19.670> blender

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030 
we're gonna do this with the blender

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:22.780 
we're gonna do this with the blender
till<00:03:20.209> we<00:03:20.359> get<00:03:20.540> it<00:03:20.630> to<00:03:20.780> trace<00:03:21.340> see<00:03:22.340> now<00:03:22.549> it's

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:22.790 
till we get it to trace see now it's

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:28.599 
till we get it to trace see now it's
starting<00:03:23.180> to<00:03:23.329> slide<00:03:26.769> then<00:03:27.769> we<00:03:27.920> plop<00:03:28.160> it<00:03:28.310> across

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:28.609 
starting to slide then we plop it across

00:03:28.609 --> 00:03:32.259 
starting to slide then we plop it across
it<00:03:28.880> and<00:03:29.299> it<00:03:29.420> whips<00:03:29.630> up<00:03:29.930> it<00:03:30.109> Frost's<00:03:30.530> up<00:03:31.269> that's

00:03:32.259 --> 00:03:32.269 
it and it whips up it Frost's up that's

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:35.349 
it and it whips up it Frost's up that's
trick<00:03:33.250> now<00:03:34.250> that<00:03:34.459> we've<00:03:34.579> reached<00:03:34.760> trace<00:03:35.120> all

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:35.359 
trick now that we've reached trace all

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:38.800 
trick now that we've reached trace all
we<00:03:35.450> have<00:03:35.600> to<00:03:35.720> do<00:03:35.870> is<00:03:36.019> just<00:03:36.200> pour<00:03:36.440> our<00:03:36.590> soap<00:03:37.810> into

we have to do is just pour our soap into
our<00:03:38.989> mold<00:03:43.450> and<00:03:44.450> now<00:03:44.630> that<00:03:44.870> the<00:03:44.989> lids<00:03:45.200> on<00:03:45.440> we're

00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:45.739 
our mold and now that the lids on we're

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:52.410 
our mold and now that the lids on we're
just<00:03:45.950> going<00:03:46.070> to<00:03:46.160> take<00:03:46.280> us<00:03:46.459> some<00:03:46.489> towels

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:52.420

and we're just gonna let this sit and in
about<00:03:57.640> four<00:03:58.000> hours<00:03:58.030> or<00:03:58.660> so<00:03:58.690> we're<00:03:59.620> gonna<00:03:59.740> open

00:03:59.970 --> 00:03:59.980 
about four hours or so we're gonna open

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:02.040 
about four hours or so we're gonna open
it<00:04:00.220> up<00:04:00.400> and<00:04:00.700> cut<00:04:00.970> it<00:04:01.090> before<00:04:01.420> it<00:04:01.540> gets<00:04:01.630> hard<00:04:01.900> I

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:02.050 
it up and cut it before it gets hard I

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:13.260 
it up and cut it before it gets hard I
could<00:04:02.459> let's<00:04:03.459> just<00:04:03.640> take<00:04:03.819> it<00:04:03.850> out<00:04:04.150> I<00:04:12.270> guess

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:13.270 
could let's just take it out I guess

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:15.930 
could let's just take it out I guess
I'll<00:04:13.450> be<00:04:13.480> able<00:04:13.600> to<00:04:13.750> reuse<00:04:14.700> parchment<00:04:15.700> paper
