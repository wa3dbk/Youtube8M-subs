and they run independent of each other I

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:17.819 
and they run independent of each other I
mean<00:03:16.900> they<00:03:17.140> worked<00:03:17.319> you<00:03:17.379> know<00:03:17.470> they<00:03:17.650> work

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:17.829 
mean they worked you know they work

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:19.589 
mean they worked you know they work
together<00:03:18.010> where<00:03:18.400> you<00:03:18.430> can<00:03:18.760> turn<00:03:18.940> one<00:03:19.209> turn<00:03:19.450> it

00:03:19.589 --> 00:03:19.599 
together where you can turn one turn it

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:22.259 
together where you can turn one turn it
on<00:03:19.750> or<00:03:20.049> off<00:03:20.079> from<00:03:20.620> either<00:03:20.829> end<00:03:21.129> whichever<00:03:22.060> one

there's<00:04:37.090> low<00:04:37.270> and<00:04:37.479> then<00:04:37.570> it'll<00:04:37.659> cycle<00:04:37.870> back

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:38.200 
there's low and then it'll cycle back

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:40.560 
there's low and then it'll cycle back
through<00:04:38.520> whichever<00:04:39.520> one<00:04:39.789> you<00:04:39.940> want<00:04:40.150> that's

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:48.580 
cycle back up through you go to medium

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:50.430 
cycle back up through you go to medium
or<00:04:48.670> high<00:04:48.880> you<00:04:49.300> let<00:04:49.480> go<00:04:49.630> that's<00:04:49.930> where<00:04:50.110> it's<00:04:50.260> at
