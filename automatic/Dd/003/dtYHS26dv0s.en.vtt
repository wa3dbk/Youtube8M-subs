00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:06.670 
little ramekins so great best idea to

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:08.520 
little ramekins so great best idea to
align<00:01:06.940> with<00:01:07.149> the<00:01:07.420> bases<00:01:07.810> then<00:01:08.050> you'll<00:01:08.200> be<00:01:08.320> sure

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:08.530 
align with the bases then you'll be sure

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:10.440 
align with the bases then you'll be sure
that<00:01:08.740> they'll<00:01:08.890> turn<00:01:09.369> out<00:01:09.460> other<00:01:09.700> words<00:01:09.850> stick

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:10.450 
that they'll turn out other words stick

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:14.400 
that they'll turn out other words stick
so<00:01:10.750> can't<00:01:11.440> trace<00:01:11.680> around<00:01:11.979> the<00:01:12.670> bottom<00:01:13.000> now<00:01:13.960> 22

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:14.410

our egg this one egg for this residue I
want<00:02:26.800> the<00:02:26.890> sugar<00:02:27.250> so<00:02:29.610> what<00:02:30.610> we<00:02:30.760> got<00:02:30.940> if<00:02:31.209> you<00:02:31.360> go

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
want the sugar so what we got if you go

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:38.310 
want the sugar so what we got if you go
to<00:02:31.540> sugar<00:02:31.989> for<00:02:32.230> two<00:02:34.320> okay<00:02:36.390> then<00:02:37.390> it<00:02:37.510> goes<00:02:37.720> until

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:38.320 
to sugar for two okay then it goes until

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:41.580 
to sugar for two okay then it goes until
it's<00:02:38.590> smooth<00:02:38.920> but<00:02:39.610> not<00:02:40.360> your<00:02:40.810> hair<00:02:41.080> at<00:02:41.260> it<00:02:41.410> too

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
it's smooth but not your hair at it too

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:49.430 
it's smooth but not your hair at it too
much<00:02:41.769> just<00:02:43.680> slides<00:02:44.680> down<00:02:46.470> into<00:02:47.760> mixing<00:02:48.760> and

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
much just slides down into mixing and

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:59.180 
much just slides down into mixing and
it'll<00:02:50.440> be<00:02:50.590> essentially<00:02:51.220> pistols<00:02:57.120> that's

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
it'll be essentially pistols that's

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:03.900 
it'll be essentially pistols that's
smooth<00:03:01.080> which<00:03:02.100> then<00:03:03.100> is<00:03:03.280> going<00:03:03.519> to<00:03:03.640> divide

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:03.910 
smooth which then is going to divide

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:07.949 
smooth which then is going to divide
that<00:03:04.180> between<00:03:04.330> the<00:03:04.600> two<00:03:05.760> prepared<00:03:06.760> lawns<00:03:07.090> or

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:07.959 
that between the two prepared lawns or

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:12.240 
that between the two prepared lawns or
ramekins<00:03:08.500> and<00:03:09.810> you<00:03:10.810> know<00:03:10.900> this<00:03:11.709> is<00:03:11.769> a<00:03:11.950> great

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250 
ramekins and you know this is a great

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:15.570 
ramekins and you know this is a great
base<00:03:12.610> you<00:03:12.910> could<00:03:13.380> take<00:03:14.380> this<00:03:14.560> in<00:03:14.800> direction

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:15.580 
base you could take this in direction

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:17.030 
base you could take this in direction
you<00:03:15.700> wanted<00:03:15.940> to<00:03:16.150> really<00:03:16.390> so<00:03:16.630> if<00:03:16.690> you<00:03:16.780> want

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
you wanted to really so if you want
