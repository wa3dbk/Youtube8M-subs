00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:06.530 
a radio frequency and what it does is it

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:08.590 
a radio frequency and what it does is it
causes<00:01:06.799> the<00:01:07.159> cells<00:01:07.430> to<00:01:07.700> vibrate<00:01:08.180> and<00:01:08.360> that's

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:08.600 
causes the cells to vibrate and that's

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.050 
causes the cells to vibrate and that's

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:11.060 
how it generates its heat so it doesn't

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.399 
how it generates its heat so it doesn't
burn<00:01:11.270> and<00:01:12.229> it's<00:01:12.560> a<00:01:13.869> it's<00:01:14.869> almost<00:01:15.110> foolproof

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 
okay and it really does make a

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.819 
okay and it really does make a
difference<00:01:59.030> that<00:01:59.359> they<00:01:59.450> do<00:01:59.509> look<00:01:59.780> softer<00:02:00.289> mmm

difference that they do look softer mmm
in<00:02:00.950> the<00:02:01.069> before<00:02:01.340> the<00:02:01.549> after<00:02:01.909> treatment<00:02:02.329> and

00:02:02.529 --> 00:02:02.539 
in the before the after treatment and

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:04.029 
in the before the after treatment and
again<00:02:02.990> we're<00:02:03.170> looking<00:02:03.380> at<00:02:03.469> those<00:02:03.590> wrinkles

00:02:04.029 --> 00:02:04.039 
again we're looking at those wrinkles

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:06.969 
again we're looking at those wrinkles
around<00:02:04.219> our<00:02:04.429> eyes<00:02:04.929> in<00:02:05.929> just<00:02:06.200> 30<00:02:06.409> days<00:02:06.499> after

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:06.979 
around our eyes in just 30 days after

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:09.430 
around our eyes in just 30 days after
it's<00:02:07.130> a<00:02:07.219> big<00:02:07.369> difference<00:02:07.929> yes<00:02:08.929> we<00:02:09.140> do<00:02:09.289> the

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 
it's a big difference yes we do the

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.410 
it's a big difference yes we do the
treatments<00:02:10.340> what's<00:02:10.550> recommended<00:02:10.759> is<00:02:11.210> to<00:02:11.300> do

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
treatments what's recommended is to do

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.420 
treatments what's recommended is to do
the<00:02:11.540> treatments<00:02:11.960> about<00:02:12.200> 30<00:02:12.530> days<00:02:12.740> apart<00:02:13.130> and

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
the treatments about 30 days apart and

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:16.020 
the treatments about 30 days apart and
what<00:02:14.120> you're<00:02:14.330> doing<00:02:14.630> is<00:02:14.750> you're<00:02:14.780> actually

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
what you're doing is you're actually

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.010 
what you're doing is you're actually
contracting<00:02:17.030> the<00:02:17.120> collagen<00:02:17.600> layer<00:02:17.780> or<00:02:17.960> the

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:18.020 
contracting the collagen layer or the

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:19.790 
contracting the collagen layer or the
foundation<00:02:18.680> of<00:02:18.770> the<00:02:18.890> skin<00:02:19.190> and

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
foundation of the skin and

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.700 
foundation of the skin and
that<00:02:20.100> contracts<00:02:20.880> almost<00:02:21.480> immediately<00:02:21.720> and<00:02:22.260> it

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:22.710 
that contracts almost immediately and it

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:24.350 
that contracts almost immediately and it
will<00:02:22.800> stimulate<00:02:23.010> new<00:02:23.400> collagen<00:02:23.430> growth<00:02:23.940> that

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
will stimulate new collagen growth that

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.140 
will stimulate new collagen growth that
will<00:02:24.480> help<00:02:24.660> maintain<00:02:24.900> the<00:02:25.410> effect<00:02:25.770> okay<00:02:26.460> and

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
will help maintain the effect okay and

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:28.160 
will help maintain the effect okay and
that<00:02:27.330> seems<00:02:27.510> to<00:02:27.630> be<00:02:27.660> the<00:02:27.840> big<00:02:27.990> thing<00:02:28.140> that

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
that seems to be the big thing that

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:29.390 
that seems to be the big thing that
everyone's<00:02:28.530> talking<00:02:28.590> about<00:02:28.860> now<00:02:29.100> is<00:02:29.190> you<00:02:29.280> got

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
to get that collagen working again get

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:32.990 
to get that collagen working again get
that<00:02:31.260> youthful<00:02:31.590> appearance<00:02:31.830> back<00:02:32.220> yep<00:02:32.580> all

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
that youthful appearance back yep all

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.160 
that youthful appearance back yep all
right<00:02:33.150> how<00:02:33.270> many<00:02:33.330> treatments<00:02:33.810> does<00:02:33.930> a<00:02:33.960> person

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
right how many treatments does a person

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:35.600 
right how many treatments does a person
typically<00:02:34.590> need<00:02:34.800> to<00:02:34.950> see<00:02:35.100> some<00:02:35.250> difference

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
typically need to see some difference

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.360 
typically need to see some difference
you<00:02:36.570> can<00:02:36.600> see<00:02:36.990> improvement<00:02:37.800> after<00:02:37.890> the<00:02:38.130> first

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
you can see improvement after the first

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.700 
you can see improvement after the first
treatment<00:02:38.640> we<00:02:39.600> recommend<00:02:40.140> doing<00:02:40.290> three

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:40.710 
treatment we recommend doing three

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:43.760 
treatment we recommend doing three
treatments<00:02:41.190> at<00:02:41.760> one<00:02:42.690> month<00:02:42.840> intervals<00:02:43.170> okay

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770 
treatments at one month intervals okay

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:46.370 
treatments at one month intervals okay
and<00:02:44.010> so<00:02:44.160> by<00:02:44.520> the<00:02:44.580> 30<00:02:45.480> days<00:02:45.720> you're<00:02:46.050> seeing<00:02:46.260> a

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
and so by the 30 days you're seeing a

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:47.810 
and so by the 30 days you're seeing a
difference<00:02:46.740> you<00:02:46.890> get<00:02:47.040> another<00:02:47.250> treatment<00:02:47.520> and

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820 
difference you get another treatment and

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:49.400 
difference you get another treatment and
it's<00:02:47.940> improved<00:02:48.330> and<00:02:48.510> it<00:02:48.630> just<00:02:48.780> keeps<00:02:48.870> actually

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
it's improved and it just keeps actually

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:50.960 
it's improved and it just keeps actually
out<00:02:49.590> right<00:02:49.620> after<00:02:49.980> the<00:02:50.190> procedure<00:02:50.370> you<00:02:50.790> can

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
out right after the procedure you can

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.520 
out right after the procedure you can
actually<00:02:51.120> feel<00:02:51.510> a<00:02:51.540> little<00:02:51.750> tightening<00:02:52.380> of<00:02:52.500> the

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
collagen grows after about two to three

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:05.600
