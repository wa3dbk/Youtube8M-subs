00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:23.779
 s 

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:27.679
 Below is a new edition of the race 

00:00:28.319 --> 00:00:31.319
 Of course, I think that's designed to be torn 

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:42.300
 This may finally be a simple and thus penultimate and a linkage 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.020
 from an old self 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:46.040
 to get all the water tight 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.150
 you have to de 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:50.480
 Tighten obstetrician 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.560
 You can attach credits in this point as well 

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:56.740
 as well as at the four corners of the tent 

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:58.360
 the world 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:01.360
 put a wedding ring when it arises 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.600
 but let's take a look at the structure of the tent 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.570
 the set consists as already mentioned of two old ten bars on the 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.680
 corresponding length was deflected in this case six segments 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:19.799
 and at the ends are the shock 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.320
 each 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.320
 to solve 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.400
 through this 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.300
 the linkage is guided 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:30.990
 as 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.450
 Sorkin 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:35.970
 Function for the whole list it became in this case one 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.850
 Cap of a New Year's Eve rocket used of these we need four 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.090
 Piece to the 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.470
 four corners of the offender 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:47.880
 each to have a fixation 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.560
 in the middle where the poles intersect 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.550
 gets easy with the Brado's body cells 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:55.400
 the cross tied together 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.580
 around here too 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:59.820
 one to have the clarification 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.640
 All in all the tent flies inclusive poles 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.160
 both and a killer 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:10.800
 It's going to be 11,600 grams so it's going to be all in all 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.129
 and just easy 

00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:15.129
 fit 

00:02:16.089 --> 00:02:19.139
 Another way to set the top ten 

00:02:19.139 --> 00:02:22.139
 it is in the unfolded state simply to take in a tree 

00:02:22.929 --> 00:02:25.369
 and to have such a protection from behind 

00:02:25.369 --> 00:02:29.349
 who now, for example, find a way in case of a strong thunderstorm 

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:29.889
 would 

00:02:29.889 --> 00:02:31.789
 or it starts to rain 

00:02:31.789 --> 00:02:35.189
 You should always have it with you for the covenant and thus you have one 

00:02:35.189 --> 00:02:37.929
 Lingen less minutes 

00:02:37.929 --> 00:02:40.469
 built a protection claim 

00:02:40.469 --> 00:02:42.989
 This is easy to set up 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:46.269
 This can also be said as zones protection to the man 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:49.229
 and a kind of beach shell 

00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:51.549
 and either dumping kipping a tree 

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:53.950
 or just the planners alone without the linkage 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:54.939
 easy with 

00:02:54.939 --> 00:02:58.699
 Hambach a few steps and Eddy Risch only at the tree distance 

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:04.430
 As already mentioned, the page is also easier to use 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:05.889
 Build pitched roof 

00:03:05.889 --> 00:03:08.999
 this simply two corners were the punch 

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:12.219
 each attached to a tree 

00:03:12.219 --> 00:03:15.739
 and back at the back the whole thing was stuck with 2 

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:18.999
 Tensioned on the ground 

00:03:18.999 --> 00:03:20.819
 So you just stuck 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:22.379
 Pop Art 

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:25.089
 that protects against wind and weather 

00:03:25.089 --> 00:03:27.099
 the hood in the middle 

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:30.039
 Real can be tied off if necessary 

00:03:30.039 --> 00:03:33.409
 with those already mentioned 

00:03:33.409 --> 00:03:36.409
 Cord bands that are automatically included 

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:40.229
 be the account 

00:03:40.999 --> 00:03:43.969
 It would also be possible for two rather weak Nideggen 

00:03:43.969 --> 00:03:46.769
 the top or the Punjab 

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:49.769
 horizontally between several bulls aufzuspannen 

00:03:50.309 --> 00:03:53.919
 Seat brings on the one hand Linzer big shadow surfaces there for several 

00:03:53.919 --> 00:03:56.919
 Persons suitable to find shelter again 

00:03:57.449 --> 00:04:00.449
 and another big plus of this construction variant 

00:04:01.189 --> 00:04:03.449
 is that in case of need 

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:06.289
 on the plane itself could collect what 

00:04:06.289 --> 00:04:09.609
 Poaching middle class and paving the way for boats 

00:04:09.609 --> 00:04:12.609
 together running club simply complaining with a stone 

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:16.780
 and you could put underneath and parents 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:19.549
 or trade association called for hundreds of deaths 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:21.629
 in the tank troops would 

00:04:21.629 --> 00:04:25.999
 so you could have a drinking water supply or could 

00:04:25.999 --> 00:04:28.999
 to collect drinking water for the simplified variant 

00:04:29.999 --> 00:04:35.439
 Our survival speed makes my goal easier between 10 and 15 

00:04:35.439 --> 00:04:37.689
 Euro depending on sources of supply 

00:04:37.689 --> 00:04:38.900
 it is yes 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:42.530
 universally applicable outdoor equipment is very easy 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:45.560
 about 250 to 350 grams EOS leadership 

00:04:47.099 --> 00:04:49.850
 finds q-cells in each backpack 

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:54.780
 about CHD call rain when you're on the mountain or hikers generally should 

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:55.779
 stays 

00:04:55.779 --> 00:04:57.809
 or wood carries the land 

00:04:57.809 --> 00:05:00.960
 as a fox Bern he as a water collection 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:02.029
 Your theme 

00:05:02.029 --> 00:05:05.999
 Hertha I hope that he fell Haider cr-z Schulangst and me 

00:05:05.999 --> 00:05:06.809
 look forward to the next time
