00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
with this series is they've experimented

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.929 
with this series is they've experimented
with<00:01:39.150> those<00:01:39.390> things<00:01:40.369> we<00:01:41.369> have<00:01:41.549> eight

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
with those things we have eight

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.490 
with those things we have eight
different<00:01:42.150> drums<00:01:42.570> different<00:01:43.320> shell

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
different drums different shell

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.620 
different drums different shell
materials<00:01:44.040> but<00:01:44.579> they've<00:01:44.729> experimented<00:01:45.149> with

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
materials but they've experimented with

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.870 
materials but they've experimented with
the<00:01:45.750> snares<00:01:46.049> the<00:01:46.619> hoops<00:01:46.860> and<00:01:47.159> the<00:01:47.310> lugs<00:01:47.549> on

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
the snares the hoops and the lugs on

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.700 
the snares the hoops and the lugs on
each<00:01:48.030> one<00:01:48.299> to<00:01:48.990> kind<00:01:49.170> of<00:01:49.229> bring<00:01:49.439> out<00:01:49.560> the

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
each one to kind of bring out the

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.530 
each one to kind of bring out the
characteristics<00:01:50.490> of<00:01:50.610> each<00:01:50.759> particular<00:01:51.119> drum

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
characteristics of each particular drum

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.480 
characteristics of each particular drum
and<00:01:51.780> I<00:01:51.869> think<00:01:52.049> that<00:01:52.170> gives<00:01:52.320> each<00:01:52.560> drum<00:01:52.829> its<00:01:53.340> own

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
and I think that gives each drum its own

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.030 
and I think that gives each drum its own
personality
