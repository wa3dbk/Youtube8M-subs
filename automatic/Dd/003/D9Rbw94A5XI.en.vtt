your specific exercises in the gym so
you<00:00:27.449> don't<00:00:27.660> have<00:00:27.869> to<00:00:28.080> so<00:00:28.859> let's<00:00:29.010> jump<00:00:29.340> right

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
you don't have to so let's jump right

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:35.120 
you don't have to so let's jump right
into<00:00:29.640> the<00:00:29.789> demo<00:00:33.020> so<00:00:34.020> here<00:00:34.200> you<00:00:34.350> see<00:00:34.380> a<00:00:34.530> raw<00:00:34.829> data

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
into the demo so here you see a raw data

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.130 
into the demo so here you see a raw data
stream<00:00:35.489> from<00:00:35.700> one<00:00:35.850> of<00:00:35.969> our<00:00:36.030> prototypes<00:00:36.600> so<00:00:37.050> you

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
stream from one of our prototypes so you

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.770 
stream from one of our prototypes so you
can<00:00:37.290> see<00:00:37.469> if<00:00:37.649> I<00:00:37.770> move<00:00:38.070> in<00:00:38.340> this<00:00:38.790> direction<00:00:39.000> you

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
can see if I move in this direction you

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.260 
can see if I move in this direction you
pronounce<00:00:40.140> either<00:00:40.770> trace<00:00:41.010> in<00:00:41.190> blue<00:00:41.399> if<00:00:42.000> I<00:00:42.059> move

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
pronounce either trace in blue if I move

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.330 
pronounce either trace in blue if I move
in<00:00:42.420> this<00:00:42.570> direction<00:00:42.840> you<00:00:43.530> see<00:00:43.770> it<00:00:43.860> in<00:00:43.920> red<00:00:44.160> and

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
in this direction you see it in red and

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.930 
in this direction you see it in red and
likewise<00:00:45.090> for<00:00:45.120> this<00:00:45.480> direction<00:00:45.660> in<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.620> green

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:46.940 
likewise for this direction in the green

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.729 
likewise for this direction in the green
Atlas<00:00:47.940> sifts<00:00:48.600> through<00:00:48.629> these<00:00:48.989> data<00:00:49.379> streams

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
Atlas sifts through these data streams

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.130 
Atlas sifts through these data streams
and<00:00:50.010> essentially<00:00:50.820> maps<00:00:51.149> out<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:51.510> motion

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
and essentially maps out the motion

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.470 
and essentially maps out the motion
trajectory<00:00:52.710> of<00:00:52.890> your<00:00:53.190> wrist<00:00:53.399> so<00:00:54.210> let's<00:00:54.360> do

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
trajectory of your wrist so let's do

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:01.580 
trajectory of your wrist so let's do
some<00:00:54.660> exercises<00:00:59.510> so<00:01:00.510> alice<00:01:00.840> is<00:01:00.960> a<00:01:00.989> single

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
some exercises so alice is a single

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.340 
some exercises so alice is a single
wrist-worn<00:01:02.340> sensor<00:01:02.820> and<00:01:03.000> you<00:01:03.660> can<00:01:03.809> see<00:01:04.019> here

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
wrist-worn sensor and you can see here

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.950 
wrist-worn sensor and you can see here
you<00:01:04.500> begin<00:01:04.830> to<00:01:04.860> identify<00:01:05.119> certain<00:01:06.119> motion

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
you begin to identify certain motion

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.350 
you begin to identify certain motion
fingerprints<00:01:07.670> characteristic<00:01:08.670> of<00:01:08.820> specific

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
fingerprints characteristic of specific

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.200 
fingerprints characteristic of specific
movements<00:01:09.869> as<00:01:10.100> I<00:01:11.100> complete<00:01:11.490> these<00:01:11.610> exercises

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
movements as I complete these exercises

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.359 
movements as I complete these exercises
Atlas<00:01:12.900> will<00:01:13.049> automatically<00:01:13.680> identify<00:01:14.310> the

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
Atlas will automatically identify the

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.539 
Atlas will automatically identify the
exercise<00:01:14.939> and<00:01:15.210> count<00:01:15.509> them<00:01:15.659> for<00:01:15.960> me<00:01:16.080> and<00:01:16.549> also

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
exercise and count them for me and also

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.429 
exercise and count them for me and also
with<00:01:17.820> just<00:01:18.090> a<00:01:18.210> single<00:01:18.479> wrist-worn<00:01:18.990> sensor

with just a single wrist-worn sensor

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:24.100 
with just a single wrist-worn sensor
Atlas<00:01:19.799> can<00:01:19.920> also<00:01:20.070> do<00:01:20.280> full<00:01:20.549> body<00:01:20.790> motions

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.110 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:32.660 

doing<00:01:25.110> squats<00:01:25.439> on<00:01:25.560> stage<00:01:28.009> there<00:01:29.009> you<00:01:29.159> go<00:01:31.670> not

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
doing squats on stage there you go not

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.300 
doing squats on stage there you go not
only<00:01:32.909> that<00:01:33.030> but<00:01:33.210> Atlas<00:01:33.960> is<00:01:34.110> specific<00:01:34.740> such

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
only that but Atlas is specific such

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.179 
only that but Atlas is specific such
that<00:01:35.460> it<00:01:35.549> can<00:01:35.579> tell<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:36.000> difference<00:01:36.150> between

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:37.189 
that it can tell the difference between

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:44.480 
that it can tell the difference between
simultaneous<00:01:38.189> bicep<00:01:38.579> curls<00:01:41.030> and<00:01:43.189> also<00:01:44.189> when<00:01:44.460> i

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
simultaneous bicep curls and also when i

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.240 
simultaneous bicep curls and also when i
switch<00:01:44.759> to<00:01:44.790> alternating<00:01:45.360> bicep<00:01:45.869> curls<00:01:46.250> again

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
switch to alternating bicep curls again

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:55.520 
switch to alternating bicep curls again
all<00:01:47.520> done<00:01:47.939> with<00:01:48.119> a<00:01:48.149> single<00:01:48.689> wrist-worn<00:01:49.140> sensor

this<00:03:23.200> markets<00:03:23.530> already<00:03:23.739> done<00:03:23.890> what<00:03:24.070> are<00:03:24.160> you

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.220 
this markets already done what are you

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:25.440 
this markets already done what are you
doing<00:03:24.400> it's<00:03:24.519> too<00:03:24.610> crowded<00:03:24.790> I<00:03:25.060> don't<00:03:25.239> think<00:03:25.390> it

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450 
doing it's too crowded I don't think it

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:27.180 
doing it's too crowded I don't think it
is<00:03:25.600> because<00:03:25.810> I<00:03:26.200> think<00:03:26.290> for<00:03:26.709> the<00:03:26.739> right

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.190 
is because I think for the right

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:29.250 
is because I think for the right
solution<00:03:27.880> there's<00:03:28.180> it<00:03:28.420> is<00:03:28.570> still<00:03:28.930> not

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
solution there's it is still not

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.979 
solution there's it is still not
satisfying<00:03:30.010> and<00:03:30.250> I<00:03:30.280> were<00:03:30.610> early<00:03:30.970> days<00:03:31.180> so<00:03:31.750> I

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:31.989 
satisfying and I were early days so I

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:33.420 
satisfying and I were early days so I
like<00:03:32.260> that<00:03:32.380> you're<00:03:32.500> going<00:03:32.709> after<00:03:32.860> this<00:03:33.070> market

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:33.430 
like that you're going after this market

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:35.400 
like that you're going after this market
even<00:03:33.580> though<00:03:33.730> it's<00:03:33.850> seemingly<00:03:34.209> crowded<00:03:34.780> a

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:35.410 
even though it's seemingly crowded a

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:38.040 
even though it's seemingly crowded a
couple<00:03:36.250> concerns<00:03:36.550> though<00:03:36.910> you<00:03:37.450> know<00:03:37.540> I<00:03:37.750> think

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:38.050 
couple concerns though you know I think

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:40.320 
couple concerns though you know I think
the<00:03:38.260> look<00:03:38.590> of<00:03:38.769> it<00:03:38.920> it<00:03:39.130> really<00:03:39.670> looks<00:03:40.209> like

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:40.330 
the look of it it really looks like

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:42.300 
the look of it it really looks like
something<00:03:40.810> you<00:03:40.930> would<00:03:41.019> only<00:03:41.350> wear<00:03:41.709> in<00:03:41.920> the<00:03:41.950> gym

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.310 
something you would only wear in the gym

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:44.729 
something you would only wear in the gym
whereas<00:03:43.120> like<00:03:43.300> the<00:03:43.450> nice<00:03:43.630> thing<00:03:43.870> about<00:03:43.900> the

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:44.739 
whereas like the nice thing about the

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:46.620 
whereas like the nice thing about the
you<00:03:45.040> know<00:03:45.160> fuel<00:03:45.459> or<00:03:45.700> the<00:03:45.850> up<00:03:46.030> is<00:03:46.269> it<00:03:46.420> something

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:46.630 
you know fuel or the up is it something

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:49.320 
you know fuel or the up is it something
that's<00:03:46.930> 40<00:03:47.590> it's<00:03:47.860> not<00:03:48.040> jewelry<00:03:48.400> certainly<00:03:49.120> but

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:49.330 
that's 40 it's not jewelry certainly but

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:51.000 
that's 40 it's not jewelry certainly but
it's<00:03:49.450> something<00:03:49.780> you<00:03:49.900> can<00:03:50.080> wear<00:03:50.230> everyday<00:03:50.680> and

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.010 
it's something you can wear everyday and

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:53.490 
it's something you can wear everyday and
it<00:03:51.100> doesn't<00:03:51.400> look<00:03:51.430> out<00:03:51.700> of<00:03:51.850> place<00:03:51.880> so<00:03:52.780> if<00:03:53.200> it's

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:53.500 
it doesn't look out of place so if it's

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:57.120 
it doesn't look out of place so if it's
really<00:03:54.130> only<00:03:54.370> for<00:03:54.820> this<00:03:54.940> power<00:03:55.360> gym<00:03:55.959> user<00:03:56.380> how

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:57.130 
really only for this power gym user how

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:59.220 
really only for this power gym user how
big<00:03:57.489> of<00:03:57.519> a<00:03:57.700> market<00:03:58.030> is<00:03:58.150> that<00:03:58.510> yeah<00:03:59.019> absolutely

00:03:59.220 --> 00:03:59.230 
big of a market is that yeah absolutely

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:02.420 
big of a market is that yeah absolutely
uh<00:03:59.820> initially<00:04:00.820> I<00:04:01.000> totally<00:04:01.720> agree<00:04:01.810> with<00:04:02.140> the

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
uh initially I totally agree with the

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:04.920 
uh initially I totally agree with the
solutions<00:04:03.430> in<00:04:03.610> the<00:04:03.640> market<00:04:03.790> but<00:04:04.630> moving

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:04.930 
solutions in the market but moving

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:07.430 
solutions in the market but moving
towards<00:04:05.260> a<00:04:05.380> little<00:04:05.590> bit<00:04:05.710> with<00:04:05.890> the

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440 
towards a little bit with the

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.900 
towards a little bit with the
93<00:04:08.440> preprint<00:04:08.890> photo<00:04:09.070> so<00:04:09.400> the<00:04:09.520> design<00:04:09.640> itself

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:09.910 
93 preprint photo so the design itself

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:12.240 
93 preprint photo so the design itself
of<00:04:10.240> the<00:04:10.270> Atlas<00:04:10.630> is<00:04:10.810> modular<00:04:11.350> so<00:04:12.010> the

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:12.250 
of the Atlas is modular so the

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:13.980 
of the Atlas is modular so the
electronics<00:04:12.910> are<00:04:13.030> housed<00:04:13.300> in<00:04:13.660> the<00:04:13.690> top

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:13.990 
electronics are housed in the top

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:15.720 
electronics are housed in the top
component<00:04:14.620> and<00:04:14.740> the<00:04:15.040> band<00:04:15.280> is<00:04:15.400> something<00:04:15.640> that

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:15.730 
component and the band is something that

you<00:04:15.820> can<00:04:15.850> actually<00:04:16.120> swap<00:04:16.660> out<00:04:16.959> so<00:04:17.530> you're<00:04:17.650> not

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:17.769 
you can actually swap out so you're not

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:20.280 
you can actually swap out so you're not
limited<00:04:18.340> to<00:04:18.580> the<00:04:18.880> standard<00:04:19.330> black<00:04:19.870> band<00:04:20.170> that

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:20.290 
limited to the standard black band that

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:21.750 
limited to the standard black band that
it<00:04:20.380> comes<00:04:20.560> with<00:04:20.620> in<00:04:20.830> fact<00:04:21.010> you<00:04:21.130> can<00:04:21.220> customize

thank<00:04:22.300> you<00:04:23.550> there's<00:04:24.550> some<00:04:24.670> tape<00:04:24.850> here<00:04:24.880> but

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:25.240 
thank you there's some tape here but

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:27.690 
thank you there's some tape here but
it's<00:04:26.170> customizable<00:04:26.800> two<00:04:27.190> different<00:04:27.490> types<00:04:27.610> of

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:27.700 
it's customizable two different types of

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:29.010 
it's customizable two different types of
materials<00:04:28.210> different<00:04:28.420> types<00:04:28.720> of<00:04:28.810> colors

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:29.020 
materials different types of colors

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:31.140 
materials different types of colors
different<00:04:29.590> bands<00:04:29.800> thicknesses<00:04:30.460> so<00:04:30.910> you<00:04:31.000> can

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:31.150 
different bands thicknesses so you can

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:33.300 
different bands thicknesses so you can
really<00:04:31.420> take<00:04:31.930> control<00:04:32.290> of<00:04:32.440> the<00:04:32.710> fashionable

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:33.310 
really take control of the fashionable

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:35.400 
really take control of the fashionable
component<00:04:33.850> of<00:04:33.940> these<00:04:34.360> wearables<00:04:34.870> and<00:04:35.020> really

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:35.410 
component of these wearables and really

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:37.140 
component of these wearables and really
make<00:04:35.560> it<00:04:35.590> your<00:04:35.830> own<00:04:35.860> right<00:04:36.520> but<00:04:36.760> it's<00:04:36.910> still

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:37.150 
make it your own right but it's still

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:40.080 
make it your own right but it's still
pretty<00:04:37.480> fat<00:04:38.010> absolutely<00:04:39.010> so<00:04:39.400> just<00:04:39.790> one<00:04:39.970> other

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:40.090 
pretty fat absolutely so just one other

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:41.820 
pretty fat absolutely so just one other
things<00:04:40.390> I<00:04:40.540> want<00:04:40.660> to<00:04:40.720> make<00:04:40.810> sure<00:04:40.840> I<00:04:40.930> don't<00:04:40.990> hog

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:41.830 
things I want to make sure I don't hog

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:45.930 
things I want to make sure I don't hog
all<00:04:42.040> of<00:04:42.190> the<00:04:42.310> time<00:04:43.440> how<00:04:44.440> beyond<00:04:45.040> just<00:04:45.310> curls

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:45.940 
all of the time how beyond just curls

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:48.210 
all of the time how beyond just curls
and<00:04:46.240> squats<00:04:46.840> which<00:04:47.350> you<00:04:47.650> can<00:04:47.830> see<00:04:48.010> why

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:48.220 
and squats which you can see why

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:50.370 
and squats which you can see why
movement<00:04:48.730> would<00:04:48.820> do<00:04:48.970> it<00:04:49.120> how<00:04:49.540> deep<00:04:49.960> does<00:04:50.200> that

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:50.380 
movement would do it how deep does that

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:51.870 
movement would do it how deep does that
go<00:04:50.620> like<00:04:50.950> does<00:04:51.220> it<00:04:51.250> know<00:04:51.460> the<00:04:51.580> difference

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:51.880 
go like does it know the difference

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:54.030 
go like does it know the difference
between<00:04:51.940> me<00:04:52.270> doing<00:04:52.300> yoga<00:04:52.780> or<00:04:53.110> pilates<00:04:53.500> does<00:04:53.920> it

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:54.040 
between me doing yoga or pilates does it

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:55.440 
between me doing yoga or pilates does it
know<00:04:54.160> when<00:04:54.310> I'm<00:04:54.430> clanking<00:04:54.940> that<00:04:55.060> I'm<00:04:55.150> doing<00:04:55.270> a

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:55.450 
know when I'm clanking that I'm doing a

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:57.000 
know when I'm clanking that I'm doing a
plank<00:04:55.660> and<00:04:55.930> not<00:04:56.050> a<00:04:56.080> push-up<00:04:56.350> does<00:04:56.740> it<00:04:56.830> know<00:04:56.920> if

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:57.010 
plank and not a push-up does it know if

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:59.010 
plank and not a push-up does it know if
I'm<00:04:57.130> using<00:04:57.280> my<00:04:57.490> knees<00:04:57.790> like<00:04:58.060> that<00:04:58.420> to<00:04:58.690> me<00:04:58.870> is

00:04:59.010 --> 00:04:59.020 
I'm using my knees like that to me is

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:00.390 
I'm using my knees like that to me is
where<00:04:59.200> the<00:04:59.320> rubber<00:04:59.470> meets<00:04:59.650> the<00:04:59.950> road<00:05:00.040> and

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:00.400 
where the rubber meets the road and

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:02.160 
where the rubber meets the road and
tracking<00:05:00.760> fitness<00:05:01.150> and<00:05:01.360> that's<00:05:01.720> what<00:05:01.930> I<00:05:01.960> find

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:02.170 
tracking fitness and that's what I find

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:04.110 
tracking fitness and that's what I find
unsatisfying<00:05:02.920> about<00:05:03.310> all<00:05:03.580> the<00:05:03.730> other<00:05:03.880> ones

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:04.120 
unsatisfying about all the other ones

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:06.210 
unsatisfying about all the other ones
i'm<00:05:04.300> happy<00:05:04.630> to<00:05:04.720> log<00:05:04.930> a<00:05:04.960> workout<00:05:05.440> but<00:05:05.920> like<00:05:06.100> i

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:06.220 
i'm happy to log a workout but like i

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:07.470 
i'm happy to log a workout but like i
don't<00:05:06.430> know<00:05:06.490> the<00:05:06.610> difference<00:05:06.700> between<00:05:06.880> in<00:05:07.300> the

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:07.480 
don't know the difference between in the

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:10.050 
don't know the difference between in the
zone<00:05:07.720> or<00:05:08.080> moderate<00:05:08.650> like<00:05:08.890> the<00:05:09.220> intensity<00:05:09.880> is

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:10.060 
zone or moderate like the intensity is

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:12.330 
zone or moderate like the intensity is
really<00:05:10.630> hard<00:05:10.900> so<00:05:11.200> does<00:05:11.710> it<00:05:11.800> do<00:05:11.980> beyond

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:12.340 
really hard so does it do beyond

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:14.370 
really hard so does it do beyond
weightlifting<00:05:13.150> yeah<00:05:13.480> so<00:05:13.690> speaking<00:05:14.110> to<00:05:14.169> the

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:14.380 
weightlifting yeah so speaking to the

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:16.380 
weightlifting yeah so speaking to the
technology<00:05:14.919> atlas<00:05:15.370> is<00:05:15.610> the<00:05:15.820> tech<00:05:16.000> the<00:05:16.180> core

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:16.390 
technology atlas is the tech the core

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:18.840 
technology atlas is the tech the core
tech<00:05:16.720> software<00:05:17.470> tech<00:05:17.650> does<00:05:18.070> move<00:05:18.340> beyond<00:05:18.669> just

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:18.850 
tech software tech does move beyond just

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:20.490 
tech software tech does move beyond just
weightlifting<00:05:19.480> as<00:05:19.990> a<00:05:20.050> start-up

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:20.500 
weightlifting as a start-up

weightlifting as a start-up
unfortunately<00:05:21.130> we're<00:05:21.280> limited<00:05:21.580> in<00:05:21.669> both<00:05:21.700> time

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:22.060 
unfortunately we're limited in both time

our<00:05:23.530> battles<00:05:23.560> and<00:05:24.070> strength<00:05:24.730> training<00:05:25.000> is<00:05:25.120> a

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:25.180 
our battles and strength training is a

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:27.720 
our battles and strength training is a
very<00:05:25.480> easy<00:05:25.950> beachhead<00:05:26.950> for<00:05:27.010> us<00:05:27.340> to<00:05:27.460> begin<00:05:27.610> to

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:27.730 
very easy beachhead for us to begin to

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:29.880 
very easy beachhead for us to begin to
move<00:05:28.030> into<00:05:28.240> different<00:05:28.720> verticals<00:05:29.169> and<00:05:29.350> the

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:29.890 
move into different verticals and the

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:30.900 
move into different verticals and the
benefit<00:05:30.220> of<00:05:30.250> strength<00:05:30.550> training<00:05:30.760> of<00:05:30.880> course

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:30.910 
benefit of strength training of course

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:34.140 
benefit of strength training of course
is<00:05:31.240> form<00:05:32.169> is<00:05:32.440> of<00:05:32.710> very<00:05:32.980> high<00:05:33.250> importance<00:05:33.760> but

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:34.150 
is form is of very high importance but

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:36.440 
is form is of very high importance but
similarly<00:05:34.570> with<00:05:34.870> yoga<00:05:35.320> as<00:05:35.470> well<00:05:35.710> pilates

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:36.450 
similarly with yoga as well pilates

swimming<00:05:37.450> tennis<00:05:37.720> golf<00:05:38.110> there<00:05:38.560> are<00:05:38.680> also<00:05:38.830> very

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:39.370 
swimming tennis golf there are also very

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:42.720 
swimming tennis golf there are also very

gesture and form dependent physical

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:44.610 
gesture and form dependent physical
activities<00:05:43.240> so<00:05:43.930> though<00:05:44.080> initially<00:05:44.350> we're

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:44.620 
activities so though initially we're

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:46.290 
activities so though initially we're
starting<00:05:44.950> only<00:05:45.160> with<00:05:45.310> strength<00:05:45.610> training<00:05:45.940> the

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:46.300 
starting only with strength training the

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:48.030 
starting only with strength training the

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:48.040 
platform and the engine itself is very

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:50.010 
platform and the engine itself is very
much<00:05:48.460> flexible<00:05:49.030> to<00:05:49.120> all<00:05:49.270> different<00:05:49.630> types<00:05:49.810> of

3d<00:05:50.830> motion<00:05:51.070> let's<00:05:51.640> get<00:05:51.760> another<00:05:52.000> question<00:05:52.360> I

00:05:52.409 --> 00:05:52.419 
3d motion let's get another question I

00:05:52.419 --> 00:05:53.550

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:04.330 
the bounds of the technology yet but

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:05.310 
the bounds of the technology yet but
that's<00:07:04.390> something<00:07:04.690> we'll<00:07:04.810> be<00:07:04.930> able<00:07:05.020> to<00:07:05.110> solve

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:05.320
