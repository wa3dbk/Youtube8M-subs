00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
with the engineering how its put

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.349 
with the engineering how its put
together<00:00:21.810> a<00:00:22.590> couple<00:00:23.460> really<00:00:23.609> nice<00:00:23.820> sirloins

for about a half-hour and then go from

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.049 
for about a half-hour and then go from
there<00:00:31.050> so<00:00:31.769> I've<00:00:31.830> got<00:00:32.009> some<00:00:32.189> nicer<00:00:32.550> loins<00:00:32.790> on

just got them in the smoke right now so

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.229 
just got them in the smoke right now so
I<00:00:46.739> just<00:00:46.920> kind<00:00:47.190> of<00:00:47.250> want<00:00:47.430> everything<00:00:47.969> just<00:00:48.090> to

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
I just kind of want everything just to

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.840 
I just kind of want everything just to

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
smoke for a half hour I've got it at 200

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.220 
smoke for a half hour I've got it at 200
degrees<00:00:51.180> using<00:00:51.690> oak<00:00:51.870> pellets<00:00:52.320> and<00:00:54.110> let's<00:00:55.110> see

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
degrees using oak pellets and let's see

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.939 
degrees using oak pellets and let's see
how<00:00:55.350> it<00:00:55.500> does

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.069 

we're<00:00:59.550> going<00:00:59.730> to<00:00:59.789> pull<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.149> steaks<00:01:00.420> off<00:01:00.690> after

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
we're going to pull the steaks off after

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.619 
we're going to pull the steaks off after
a<00:01:01.109> half<00:01:01.350> hour<00:01:01.559> and<00:01:02.039> then<00:01:02.789> turn<00:01:03.120> the<00:01:03.239> heat<00:01:03.269> up<00:01:03.449> a

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
a half hour and then turn the heat up a

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.649 
a half hour and then turn the heat up a
little<00:01:03.659> bit<00:01:04.019> and<00:01:04.290> cook<00:01:04.500> everything<00:01:04.979> off<00:01:05.159> and

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:05.659 
little bit and cook everything off and

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:08.289 
little bit and cook everything off and
turn<00:01:06.659> it<00:01:06.810> up<00:01:06.930> a<00:01:07.049> lot<00:01:07.259> this<00:01:07.530> thing<00:01:07.740> goes<00:01:07.890> up<00:01:07.920> to

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:08.299 
turn it up a lot this thing goes up to

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:10.850 
turn it up a lot this thing goes up to
700<00:01:09.299> degrees<00:01:09.659> for<00:01:09.960> direct<00:01:10.200> searing

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
700 degrees for direct searing

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.620 
700 degrees for direct searing
then<00:01:11.280> we<00:01:11.399> put<00:01:11.549> the<00:01:11.640> steaks<00:01:11.880> back<00:01:12.119> on<00:01:12.360> for<00:01:12.600> a

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
then we put the steaks back on for a

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.359 
then we put the steaks back on for a
couple<00:01:12.899> minutes<00:01:13.020> assessed<00:01:13.470> up<00:01:13.680> at<00:01:13.890> 200

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
couple minutes assessed up at 200

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.940 
couple minutes assessed up at 200
degrees<00:01:14.759> for<00:01:15.690> 30<00:01:15.990> minutes<00:01:16.409> so<00:01:16.619> I'm<00:01:16.710> going<00:01:16.830> to

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
degrees for 30 minutes so I'm going to

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.740 
degrees for 30 minutes so I'm going to
pull<00:01:17.070> the<00:01:17.190> steaks<00:01:17.460> off<00:01:17.700> and<00:01:17.970> turn<00:01:18.180> it<00:01:18.330> up<00:01:18.479> you

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
pull the steaks off and turn it up you

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.870 
pull the steaks off and turn it up you
guys<00:01:19.350> need<00:01:19.649> to<00:01:19.770> check<00:01:19.979> out<00:01:20.220> this<00:01:20.460> control

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
later it is 30 30 minutes now I am going

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.309 
later it is 30 30 minutes now I am going
to<00:01:32.670> pull<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.149> steaks<00:01:33.420> off<00:01:33.659> and<00:01:33.929> set<00:01:34.140> them

00:01:34.309 --> 00:01:34.319 
to pull the steaks off and set them

00:01:34.319 --> 00:01:36.529 
to pull the steaks off and set them
aside<00:01:34.490> and<00:01:35.490> turn<00:01:35.729> the<00:01:35.880> temperature<00:01:36.090> up<00:01:36.509> to

00:01:36.529 --> 00:01:36.539 
aside and turn the temperature up to

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:40.130 
aside and turn the temperature up to
about<00:01:36.690> 350<00:01:37.409> and<00:01:38.330> let<00:01:39.330> everything<00:01:39.569> cook<00:01:39.929> I

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
about 350 and let everything cook I

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.020 
about 350 and let everything cook I
don't<00:01:40.200> know<00:01:40.440> if<00:01:40.530> I'm<00:01:40.649> going<00:01:40.799> to<00:01:40.890> go<00:01:40.979> 30<00:01:41.310> 45<00:01:41.970> or
