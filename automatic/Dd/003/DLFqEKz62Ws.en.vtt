the process for making iberian ham is

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:12.459 
the process for making iberian ham is
now<00:00:10.580> mechanized<00:00:11.090> but<00:00:11.809> the<00:00:11.900> human<00:00:12.259> touch<00:00:12.440> is

00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:12.469 
now mechanized but the human touch is

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:17.050 
now mechanized but the human touch is
