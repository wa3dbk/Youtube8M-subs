00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:22.600 
to visualize what they're thinking about
it<00:02:20.300> so<00:02:21.260> it's<00:02:21.410> not<00:02:21.530> just<00:02:21.590> about<00:02:21.860> drawing<00:02:22.310> what

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
it so it's not just about drawing what

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:25.330 
it so it's not just about drawing what
you<00:02:22.730> see<00:02:23.080> it's<00:02:24.080> actually<00:02:24.320> drawing<00:02:24.830> what<00:02:25.160> your

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
you see it's actually drawing what your

you see it's actually drawing what your

experimentation and their ideas will be
more<00:02:35.450> mature<00:02:35.780> and<00:02:36.080> they're<00:02:36.350> under<00:02:36.620> voice<00:02:36.830> the

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.130

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:39.709 
creative voice will be stronger when I

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:41.440 
creative voice will be stronger when I
decided<00:02:39.980> to<00:02:40.100> do<00:02:40.220> something<00:02:40.640> that<00:02:40.850> I<00:02:41.030> hadn't

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
decided to do something that I hadn't

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:44.229 
decided to do something that I hadn't
done<00:02:41.480> before<00:02:41.600> just<00:02:42.080> me<00:02:42.170> pop<00:02:42.350> off<00:02:42.500> a<00:02:42.530> book<00:02:43.239> it

00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:44.239 
done before just me pop off a book it

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:46.380 
done before just me pop off a book it
was<00:02:44.510> based<00:02:44.750> in<00:02:44.930> the<00:02:44.989> story<00:02:45.260> of<00:02:45.530> this<00:02:45.680> bird<00:02:45.980> that

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
was based in the story of this bird that

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:49.150 
was based in the story of this bird that
you<00:02:47.390> know<00:02:47.510> was<00:02:47.780> this<00:02:47.900> beautiful<00:02:48.350> bird<00:02:48.530> so<00:02:49.100> you

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
you know was this beautiful bird so you

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:50.590 
you know was this beautiful bird so you
got<00:02:49.340> the<00:02:49.459> feeling<00:02:49.820> that<00:02:49.910> they're<00:02:50.090> pushing<00:02:50.300> at

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:50.600 
got the feeling that they're pushing at

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.420 
got the feeling that they're pushing at
the<00:02:50.630> boundaries<00:02:51.110> a<00:02:51.230> little<00:02:51.410> bit<00:02:51.620> they're

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
the boundaries a little bit they're

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:54.160 
the boundaries a little bit they're
creating<00:02:52.880> a<00:02:52.970> little<00:02:53.120> bit<00:02:53.390> of<00:02:53.540> tension<00:02:53.810> between

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170 
creating a little bit of tension between

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:55.930 
creating a little bit of tension between
themselves<00:02:54.980> and<00:02:55.130> what<00:02:55.250> they're<00:02:55.400> doing<00:02:55.670> very

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
themselves and what they're doing very

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:59.350 
themselves and what they're doing very
often<00:02:56.510> our<00:02:56.870> job<00:02:57.200> is<00:02:57.350> to<00:02:57.760> help<00:02:58.760> student<00:02:59.180> them

00:02:59.350 --> 00:02:59.360 
often our job is to help student them

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:03.040 
often our job is to help student them
understand<00:02:59.930> what<00:03:00.920> level<00:03:01.730> is<00:03:02.000> suited<00:03:02.750> to<00:03:02.780> them

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.050 
understand what level is suited to them

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:04.930 
understand what level is suited to them
so<00:03:03.620> for<00:03:03.800> example<00:03:04.160> if<00:03:04.250> they<00:03:04.370> want<00:03:04.550> to<00:03:04.610> do<00:03:04.730> a<00:03:04.760> BA

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940 
so for example if they want to do a BA

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:07.270 
so for example if they want to do a BA
program<00:03:05.180> in<00:03:05.630> something<00:03:06.049> but<00:03:06.709> it's<00:03:06.890> obvious

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
program in something but it's obvious

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.009 
program in something but it's obvious
that<00:03:07.310> they<00:03:07.610> may<00:03:07.820> perhaps<00:03:08.120> need<00:03:08.570> more<00:03:08.810> help

00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:09.019 
that they may perhaps need more help

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:12.640 
that they may perhaps need more help
with<00:03:09.110> divine<00:03:09.650> development<00:03:10.310> or<00:03:11.650> process

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:44.740 
and the skills then of that discipline

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:48.210

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:00.220 
what is it I'm looking to learn and

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:02.970 
what is it I'm looking to learn and
develop<00:05:00.430> on<00:05:00.910> a<00:05:00.940> degree<00:05:01.390> I<00:05:01.630> had<00:05:02.440> this<00:05:02.560> idea<00:05:02.740> that

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:02.980 
develop on a degree I had this idea that

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:04.890 
develop on a degree I had this idea that
if<00:05:03.310> it<00:05:03.460> comes<00:05:03.610> easily<00:05:03.970> then<00:05:04.480> it's<00:05:04.630> what<00:05:04.780> you're

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:04.900 
if it comes easily then it's what you're

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:06.960 
if it comes easily then it's what you're
going<00:05:05.050> to<00:05:05.140> do<00:05:05.260> if<00:05:05.440> you<00:05:05.530> struggle<00:05:05.950> then<00:05:06.220> it's

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:06.970 
going to do if you struggle then it's

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:08.580 
going to do if you struggle then it's
not<00:05:07.240> that<00:05:07.420> great<00:05:07.600> but<00:05:07.870> I<00:05:07.990> love<00:05:08.230> the<00:05:08.350> struggle

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:08.590 
not that great but I love the struggle

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:11.310 
not that great but I love the struggle
now<00:05:08.830> because<00:05:09.670> with<00:05:09.880> this<00:05:10.030> persistence<00:05:10.600> I<00:05:10.840> get

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:11.320
