 special for oily skin 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.820
 and a question and a concern that 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:23.270
 they make us constantly so the 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:26.980

 that will take you to minimal and be 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:33.440
 changed the name this a change that 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:35.510
 I have a long time ago is that 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:39.559
 we are here has already been there I do not like 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:42.200
 because it is for all of us specifically 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:44.750
 is filled in these openings that are a 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:46.510
 very common factor of unhappiness 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:49.940
 said this can be it these main 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:52.730
 makes an introduction to this broadcast is 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:54.500
 concern of amelia the poles 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:57.170
 shines 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:59.210
 and imperfection as the factors 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.550
 common I'm fine in particular combat 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:03.110
 the dilated pores the more forums 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:05.540
 open especially in the area 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:08.330
 around the nose and the unanimism already 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:10.729
 that apart from filling the towns they leave 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:13.190
 finished a little more opaque then 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:16.400
 fight two problems at once this two 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:19.010
 or super soft and it is also intended 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.630
 for babies with the xerez removes sensitive 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:22.580
 with more clinics and that does not find a 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.750
 new product and alternatiba for that already 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.640
 that the prizes that can also be 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.840
 retouch the seen over a bit of 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.460
 makeup the good man is not 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.930
 make up for example this I want 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.210
 touch up a little here and they can do it 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:34.040
 during time I do not have the price but 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:35.660
 we'll go to it later in the box or in the 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.850
 post the list with all the names of 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:41.060
 the prizes with their prices after 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:42.850
 I have this we declare that this is a 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.050
 shows I do not have at this time 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:47.660
 prevails but the one who occupied 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:49.580
 usually but because they say it is 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:53.360
 here first because it's the first prime 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:54.980
 analyzer that I discovered and never again what 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.600
 I took out of my suitcase 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:59.150
 because I like it so much because it 's the 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:02.180
 skin very well skinned third has a 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:04.610
 filler effect and without preparing all 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:07.610
 ages has a pretty price 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:09.110
 convenient I do not want to risk 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:13.190
 throw them away because I can go wrong 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:16.040
 but it yields a lot and needs very little 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.750
 amount that's why I like it so much and 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:21.410
 that if you that would be like for the skin is 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:24.170
 the main thing that is magnificent but of 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:26.240
 Natural way you do not have it if you want 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:29.480
 you have extremely oily skin and 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:32.330
 wants to be completely opaque, it's not 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:34.520
 so like that but it keeps you empty 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:36.920
 but in a natural way that you like 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:39.790
 you feel soft the skin is not that thing 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.790
 as a tie 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:46.590
 and I like it 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:49.230
 then we have the king of the middle of 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:53.040
 glory we expect of you fat and I 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:55.470
 I had a video already in this year basically 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.450
 It will be indicated for skins a little more 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.790
 mature let's say how this line of dices 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:01.110
 as of the 35-40 years not the names 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.420
 as sting comments per day more or 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:06.780
 less good so consider more important 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:08.970
 know how to be this is for they fixed 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:11.819
 little wrinkles the line and the modes already 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:13.260
 and what it has to emphasize that 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:16.530
 they have a sun protection factor 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:20.340
 high of trail of spear that very few 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:22.620
 first they have sun protection and they 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:25.650
 can occupy before makeup and 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:27.239
 You can also use it only for those purposes 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:28.530
 of a week that maybe your skin does not 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:30.390
 requires a base does not require a 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:32.400
 corrector but if you want it to look more 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:36.110
 cute softer 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.110
 we would all like to see more list 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:41.190
 and a little the main face of this 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:43.830
 it effectively says instance kings 12 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:44.460
 here immediately this track and that of 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:46.470
 salvation 

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:48.480
 this is 106 company inside only applies 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:50.070
 in your hand as a face and proof 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:52.530
 melon and comarcales in class and 

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:54.360
 effectively does it carry a 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:56.640
 cheaper alternative also because 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:59.010
 if you remember a few years ago 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:00.870
 only the most luxurious denies had a 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:01.980
 first and today day lines juan macÃ­as 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:04.350
 they also have them that can 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:06.540
 find in pharmacies and supermarkets 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:09.540
 now we are also going to talk about this 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:13.410
 garnier that is the five optical flyer 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:15.330
 seconds that you effectively enroll and you 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:18.070
 they notice less imperfections and 

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:21.250
 wrinkles now yes they will come 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:22.720
 I am the same they are quite the great 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:25.870
 let's say fulfill the function quite 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:28.060
 similar to true the first two must 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:31.000
 warn wrinkles in addition to use the 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:33.640
 rough let's say they fill in an effect or 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:36.100
 integrate a temporary optician supplies to 

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:38.460
 me a lot is thought for pain the 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:40.450
 I really think that the visions 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:42.490
 differences I found the project 

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:45.100
 product was that this one I feel is more 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:47.860
 compact one is more opaque and a little bit 

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:49.840
 less moisturizing either albeit both 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:52.510
 I recommend the day with someone more fat 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:54.520
 this one that is actually I feel it's a 

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:56.320
 little bit more moisturizing maybe just a 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:58.270
 bit slower in maybe it makes you be a 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:00.660
 little faster and it's also a little bit 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:00.660
 less 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:10.070
 and although this one was indicated 

00:05:06.069 --> 00:05:12.610
 and this is the youngest it would be like 

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:12.610
 Y 

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:22.400
 and I had to sell here but like me 

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:25.520
 calls me 

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:27.860
 and we know what to buy online or 

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:30.740
 do commissions and someone oldies and the 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:33.340
 mark went well already if it costs you 

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:35.580
 makeup not know 

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:37.990
 you have exploration 

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:41.500
 you are learning a line of primers 

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:43.419
 this is for you in fat is today was I 

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:45.250
 I think it is quite normal and 

00:05:43.419 --> 00:05:48.550
 especially this one I like because 

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:51.130
 they have more silicone effect but 

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:53.080
 super super soft stuffs the skin without 

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:55.060
 leave the stiff and like that is true 

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:57.220
 that leaves it lighter than those that are 

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:59.380
 alice before pocket is like point 

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:01.750
 next medium that you want to leave slightly 

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:04.210
 list the skin but not as such 

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:06.370
 not so much statesman let's say and besides 

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:07.780
 super super good now my injury 

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:11.470
 then the person who arrives who 

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:12.940
 transpires because it shines too much because 

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:15.639
 it seems I apply it reinforces a little back 

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:17.530
 He found out that I do not have here 

00:06:15.639 --> 00:06:20.050
 are of matt capps isadora that 

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:24.330
 considered that it is for baby so very 

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:27.910
 thanks to this one 

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:29.889
 and all the other functions but also 

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:31.930
 we want to tell you that while these 

00:06:29.889 --> 00:06:33.460
 legalisms for oily skin do not want 

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:35.380
 say that if you do not have oily skin 

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:38.710
 you can not occupy it if you have a 

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:40.569
 mixed skin or more or more close but 

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:42.460
 certain areas if they have more fat or 

00:06:40.569 --> 00:06:45.370
 with little you can apply it in a 

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:48.370
 localized but not in all the other already what 

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:49.810
 they know blindly without knowing them he would say them 

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:52.389
 that all drivers would recommend 

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:55.690
 for a person with abnormal oily skin 

00:06:52.389 --> 00:06:57.370
 already for pleasure the whole face has 

00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:59.949
 to be careful because these 

00:06:57.370 --> 00:07:02.259
 problems tend to remove true light 

00:06:59.949 --> 00:07:04.060
 makes it cost less and then there is no 

00:07:02.259 --> 00:07:05.949
 life for you you can think about it before 

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:07.870
 hydrate at the very dry end and remove 

00:07:05.949 --> 00:07:09.320
 the pretty the area that you have to have a 

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:12.140
 little more fat 

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:14.480
 then also hit is to remember 

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:16.580
 that the first ones are used after the 

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:17.720
 True beauty flour to clean and 

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:21.680
 cut the skin 

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:24.290
 the solar factor 7 days the first and also 

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:27.490
 can be used as much as in the step of 

00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:27.490
 makeup or alone 

00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:37.840
