bluetooth<00:02:53.700> devices<00:02:54.510> have<00:02:55.200> this<00:02:55.410> dpi<00:02:56.010> button

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
bluetooth devices have this dpi button

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.730 
bluetooth devices have this dpi button
and<00:02:56.610> when<00:02:57.240> you<00:02:57.270> click<00:02:57.570> on<00:02:57.600> it<00:02:57.930> it<00:02:58.080> increases

00:02:58.730 --> 00:02:58.740 
and when you click on it it increases

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:02.720 
and when you click on it it increases
the<00:02:59.250> sensitivity<00:02:59.610> on<00:03:00.680> the<00:03:01.680> mouse<00:03:01.980> itself<00:03:02.400> so

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
the sensitivity on the mouse itself so

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.670 
the sensitivity on the mouse itself so
you<00:03:03.090> know<00:03:03.180> this<00:03:03.420> is<00:03:03.570> a<00:03:03.600> very<00:03:03.930> small<00:03:04.260> screen<00:03:04.470> to

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
you know this is a very small screen to

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.020 
you know this is a very small screen to
work<00:03:04.800> out<00:03:05.010> so<00:03:05.130> I<00:03:05.160> don't<00:03:05.370> think<00:03:05.520> you'd<00:03:05.820> bother

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
that normal so it has about three

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.010 
that normal so it has about three
different<00:03:19.860> levels<00:03:20.010> of<00:03:20.310> functionality<00:03:21.020> before

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:22.020 
different levels of functionality before

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:23.810 
different levels of functionality before
we<00:03:22.170> move<00:03:22.440> on<00:03:22.590> any<00:03:22.800> further<00:03:23.010> I<00:03:23.160> want<00:03:23.370> to<00:03:23.460> let<00:03:23.790> you
