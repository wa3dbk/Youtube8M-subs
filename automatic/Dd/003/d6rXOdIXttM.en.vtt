00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.420
TWITCH: Hey, what's goin' on ya'all? I'm tWitch. 
CAMERON: What's up? And I'm Cameron.

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:13.500
TWITCH: Since the beginning of time, humans have 
debated the great topics. CAMERON: Batman vs. Superman,

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:19.370
Oreo vs. Chips Ahoy, Ryan Gosling vs. Little
Baby Goslings. TWITCH: But today on the Great

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:27.500
Debate, we are debating Flash Mobs - the 21st
century dance craze...CAMERON: versus the Mob.

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:33.500
TWITCH: Like the Mob, like the Mafia the Mob?
CAMERON: Like, "I'm gonna make him an offer

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:38.300
he can't refuse." TWITCH: You might think
that the Mob and dance have nothing to do

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.000
with each other. CAMERON: Oh, but you're wrong.
TWITCH: Right, right. CAMERON: You're so wrong.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.329
TWITCH: So, here we go. Round 1: Who has the
bigger scale? I mean flash mobs can occur

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:59.000
in the hugest, hugest public area. They shut
down central station in Belgium with this one.

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.399
CAMERON: Well, I'll have you know, Al
Pacino shut down Grand Central Station in

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:22.800
New York City for the greatest 
mob chase of all time. 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:34.000
"He's here!" [Screaming]

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.700
CAMERON: Say hello to my little friend! 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.729
TWITCH: Okay, round 2. 
Who uses popular music the best?

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:47.300
I mean, these two awesome flash mobs used
Glee's version of "Don't Stop Believin'."

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:10.970
CAMERON&amp;TWITCH: Don't stop - believin'.
TWITCH: See, I mean there's no way that the Mob can

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:16.000
do anything like that. CAMERON: Uh, did you
see the finale of the best mob show of all

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.500
time, The Sopranos? 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.170
TWITCH: But, the ending just didn't 
make sense. What happened? I don't

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.940
know. CAMERON: That's why it's so good. Anything
could have happened. He could have died, he

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.000
could have lived, he could 
have magically turned into a lemur. 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.140
TWITCH: Round 3: Which

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:52.700
one is more utilitarian? All right, flash
mobs make sense. You can do them at weddings

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.000
with your family. 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:08.400
CAMERON: Well, what about the wedding of 
Michael and Apollonia in The Godfather?

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.100
TWITCH: That''s great. I mean,
looks like they're having a good time, blowin'

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:21.000
it up. CAMERON: Oh, you don't know the half
of it. "No, no! Apollonia!" 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.850
TWITCH: Wow.

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:30.300
CAMERON: It was a short marriage. So, tWitch, I know
it's your birthday so I got you a little something.

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:40.000
TWITCH: Oh, gee thanks, Cam! You know you
didn't have to. This is great. It's a fish.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.270
CAMERON: It means, you're about to sleep with
the fishes. TWITCH: I'm about to fish slap you.

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:50.110
Let's go ahead and move into round 4.
Which one was more of global phenomenon? And

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:53.800
I present to you this sick British flash mob.

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:11.500
CAMERON: Oh! Jolly old England, haha. Home

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:20.000
of the tea-time, of The Beatles, questionable
dentistry, and of course, my favorite British

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.000
Mob movie director, Guy Ritchie. Check out
this clip from "Snatch." 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:34.500
Eh, save your [Unintelligible] and
[Unintelligible]...

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:39.000
Right. [Unintelligible] 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:39.680
TWITCH: That wasn't even

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:45.680
English! Okay, we're done here, alright? So
the debate is over. Please let us know

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:51.909
who you thought won in the suggestion box
below. Was it Flash Mobs or the Mob? Cam,

00:04:51.909 --> 00:04:57.000
let's get out of here. CAMERON: Yah, absolutely,
just - just when I thought I was out, they

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:03.000
pull me back in! TWITCH: Pacino? CAMERON:
Yes! TWITCH: Nice! CAMERON: You get me.
