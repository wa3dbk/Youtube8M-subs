millimeters<00:00:38.310> so<00:00:38.460> you<00:00:38.520> can<00:00:38.640> go<00:00:38.700> from<00:00:38.820> extremely

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
millimeters so you can go from extremely

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.600 
millimeters so you can go from extremely
wide<00:00:39.840> or<00:00:40.620> you<00:00:40.710> can<00:00:40.829> see<00:00:40.950> everything<00:00:41.430> around

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610

you<00:00:41.820> all<00:00:42.060> the<00:00:42.090> way<00:00:42.719> to<00:00:43.230> four<00:00:43.590> hundred<00:00:43.859> and

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
you all the way to four hundred and

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.549 
you all the way to four hundred and
twenty<00:00:44.160> millimeters<00:00:44.579> which<00:00:44.640> is<00:00:44.789> a<00:00:44.820> huge<00:00:45.559> huge

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
twenty millimeters which is a huge huge

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.799 
twenty millimeters which is a huge huge
huge<00:00:46.890> zoom<00:00:47.219> it<00:00:47.430> also<00:00:47.699> has<00:00:47.940> a<00:00:48.090> macro<00:00:48.480> shooting

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
huge zoom it also has a macro shooting

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.869 
huge zoom it also has a macro shooting
ability<00:00:49.140> so<00:00:49.379> as<00:00:49.949> you<00:00:50.129> can<00:00:50.219> imagine<00:00:50.280> let's<00:00:50.820> say

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
ability so as you can imagine let's say

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.939 
ability so as you can imagine let's say
that<00:00:51.090> this<00:00:51.180> is<00:00:51.329> your<00:00:51.449> subject<00:00:51.960> and<00:00:52.320> you<00:00:52.829> were

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
that this is your subject and you were

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.189 
that this is your subject and you were
shooting<00:00:53.160> it<00:00:53.460> in<00:00:54.120> regular<00:00:54.600> mode<00:00:54.750> you<00:00:54.899> actually

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
shooting it in regular mode you actually

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.830 
shooting it in regular mode you actually
have<00:00:55.289> to<00:00:55.350> be<00:00:55.469> about<00:00:55.679> 20<00:00:56.100> inches<00:00:56.129> away<00:00:56.719> for<00:00:57.719> the

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
have to be about 20 inches away for the

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.020 
have to be about 20 inches away for the
camera<00:00:58.170> to<00:00:58.199> actually<00:00:58.620> focus<00:00:58.829> on<00:00:59.070> that<00:00:59.699> subject

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
camera to actually focus on that subject

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.910 
camera to actually focus on that subject
but<00:01:00.449> if<00:01:00.719> you<00:01:00.870> throw<00:01:01.079> it<00:01:01.140> into<00:01:01.260> macro<00:01:01.679> mode<00:01:01.800> you

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
but if you throw it into macro mode you

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.400 
but if you throw it into macro mode you
can<00:01:01.980> actually<00:01:02.519> get<00:01:02.699> point<00:01:03.329> four<00:01:03.750> inches<00:01:04.260> away

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:04.410 
can actually get point four inches away

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:07.340 
can actually get point four inches away
which<00:01:04.739> is<00:01:04.860> about<00:01:05.600> that<00:01:06.600> far<00:01:07.020> and<00:01:07.200> it<00:01:07.260> will

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
which is about that far and it will

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:08.720 
which is about that far and it will
actually<00:01:07.530> record<00:01:08.100> in<00:01:08.190> detail<00:01:08.460> and<00:01:08.550> it<00:01:08.640> will

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:08.730 
actually record in detail and it will

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:11.150 
actually record in detail and it will
focus<00:01:08.970> on<00:01:09.720> the<00:01:09.930> detail<00:01:10.290> of<00:01:10.320> your<00:01:10.500> subject<00:01:11.070> so

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:11.160 
focus on the detail of your subject so

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:12.980 
focus on the detail of your subject so
that's<00:01:11.310> a<00:01:11.430> very<00:01:11.610> very<00:01:11.760> cool<00:01:12.030> it<00:01:12.390> also<00:01:12.510> has<00:01:12.690> five

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
that's a very very cool it also has five

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.020 
that's a very very cool it also has five
way<00:01:13.230> image<00:01:13.560> stabilization<00:01:13.950> I<00:01:14.520> can<00:01:14.909> actually

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
way image stabilization I can actually

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.940 
way image stabilization I can actually
probably<00:01:15.299> illustrate<00:01:16.049> that<00:01:16.079> I'm<00:01:16.650> going<00:01:16.799> to<00:01:16.860> go

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
probably illustrate that I'm going to go

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.740 
probably illustrate that I'm going to go
really<00:01:17.280> wide<00:01:17.579> now<00:01:17.880> I'm<00:01:18.390> gonna<00:01:18.509> do<00:01:18.600> is<00:01:18.689> I'm

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
really wide now I'm gonna do is I'm

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.780 
really wide now I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna<00:01:18.810> put<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.140> camera<00:01:19.530> on<00:01:19.710> my<00:01:20.400> face<00:01:20.610> i'ma

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
gonna put the camera on my face i'ma

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:21.770 
gonna put the camera on my face i'ma
zoom<00:01:21.030> in<00:01:21.119> a<00:01:21.180> little<00:01:21.240> bit<00:01:21.360> you're<00:01:21.509> going<00:01:21.630> to<00:01:21.689> see

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
zoom in a little bit you're going to see

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.630 
zoom in a little bit you're going to see
that<00:01:21.810> my<00:01:22.049> chin<00:01:22.409> is<00:01:22.439> at<00:01:22.560> the<00:01:22.619> bottom<00:01:22.740> my<00:01:23.340> head<00:01:23.520> is

that my chin is at the bottom my head is

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.100 
that my chin is at the bottom my head is
the<00:01:23.759> top<00:01:23.970> and<00:01:24.180> I'm<00:01:24.600> going<00:01:24.750> to<00:01:24.810> shake<00:01:24.990> the

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
the top and I'm going to shake the

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.480 
the top and I'm going to shake the
camera<00:01:25.290> you're<00:01:25.590> going<00:01:25.710> to<00:01:25.770> see<00:01:25.860> that<00:01:25.890> it<00:01:26.130> you

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
camera you're going to see that it you

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:27.649 
camera you're going to see that it you
know<00:01:26.579> the<00:01:26.670> camera<00:01:26.880> doesn't<00:01:27.119> shake<00:01:27.390> the<00:01:27.509> image

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
know the camera doesn't shake the image

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:28.969 
know the camera doesn't shake the image
doesn't<00:01:27.990> shake<00:01:28.290> even<00:01:28.470> though<00:01:28.590> I'm<00:01:28.710> shaking

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
doesn't shake even though I'm shaking

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.280 
doesn't shake even though I'm shaking
the<00:01:29.070> camera<00:01:29.220> so<00:01:30.090> very<00:01:30.390> cool<00:01:30.630> has<00:01:30.750> four-way<00:01:31.259> a

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
the camera so very cool has four-way a

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:32.810 
the camera so very cool has four-way a
mental<00:01:31.649> image<00:01:31.770> stabilization<00:01:32.189> so<00:01:32.549> used<00:01:32.759> to

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
mental image stabilization so used to

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.670 
mental image stabilization so used to
maybe<00:01:32.939> one<00:01:33.840> or<00:01:33.990> two<00:01:34.020> different<00:01:34.229> way<00:01:34.439> so<00:01:34.500> this

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
maybe one or two different way so this

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.469 
maybe one or two different way so this
has<00:01:34.799> four<00:01:35.189> and<00:01:35.490> I'll<00:01:35.970> go<00:01:36.119> through<00:01:36.329> those

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
has four and I'll go through those

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.060 
has four and I'll go through those
individually<00:01:37.079> now<00:01:37.170> first<00:01:37.380> of<00:01:37.500> all<00:01:37.590> is<00:01:37.740> the

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
individually now first of all is the

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.270 
individually now first of all is the
optical<00:01:38.610> image<00:01:38.850> stabilization<00:01:39.200> basically

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:40.280 
optical image stabilization basically

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.649 
optical image stabilization basically
you<00:01:41.280> have<00:01:41.430> the<00:01:41.610> sensor<00:01:41.939> is<00:01:42.119> right<00:01:42.420> in<00:01:42.509> here

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
you have the sensor is right in here

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:43.910 
you have the sensor is right in here
imagine<00:01:42.930> the<00:01:43.020> sensor<00:01:43.259> being<00:01:43.439> right<00:01:43.619> in<00:01:43.770> there

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
imagine the sensor being right in there

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.880 
imagine the sensor being right in there
and<00:01:44.070> it<00:01:44.430> it's<00:01:45.119> parallel<00:01:45.570> to<00:01:45.600> the<00:01:45.960> lens<00:01:46.200> if

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
and it it's parallel to the lens if

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.679 
and it it's parallel to the lens if
you're<00:01:47.189> tilting<00:01:47.670> it<00:01:47.729> like<00:01:47.909> this<00:01:48.119> what<00:01:48.360> happens

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
you're tilting it like this what happens

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.450 
you're tilting it like this what happens
is<00:01:48.780> that<00:01:48.810> sensor<00:01:49.350> inside<00:01:49.590> is<00:01:49.860> actually

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
is that sensor inside is actually

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.760 
is that sensor inside is actually
tilting<00:01:50.850> back<00:01:51.119> and<00:01:51.360> forth<00:01:51.630> to<00:01:52.350> make<00:01:52.500> sure<00:01:52.649> that

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
tilting back and forth to make sure that

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.679 
tilting back and forth to make sure that
you<00:01:52.860> don't<00:01:53.039> get<00:01:53.189> blurry<00:01:53.520> images<00:01:54.000> and<00:01:54.539> that's

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
you don't get blurry images and that's

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.510 
you don't get blurry images and that's
just<00:01:54.750> one<00:01:55.110> of<00:01:55.140> the<00:01:55.439> four<00:01:55.680> ways<00:01:55.920> of<00:01:56.070> this<00:01:56.159> camera

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
just one of the four ways of this camera

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.310 
just one of the four ways of this camera
actually<00:01:56.700> shoots<00:01:57.210> image<00:01:57.990> stabilization

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
actually shoots image stabilization

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.170 
actually shoots image stabilization
another<00:01:58.799> way<00:01:58.920> is<00:01:59.039> electronic<00:01:59.640> which<00:01:59.789> is<00:02:00.030> a

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
another way is electronic which is a

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.240 
another way is electronic which is a
chip<00:02:01.110> inside<00:02:01.380> that's<00:02:01.530> going<00:02:01.680> to<00:02:01.740> process<00:02:02.100> the

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
chip inside that's going to process the

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.039 
chip inside that's going to process the
image<00:02:02.460> and<00:02:02.610> take<00:02:02.969> out<00:02:03.090> the<00:02:03.119> blur<00:02:03.360> another<00:02:03.930> one

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
image and take out the blur another one

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:05.719 
image and take out the blur another one
is<00:02:04.079> motion<00:02:04.500> detection<00:02:04.829> basically<00:02:05.369> when<00:02:05.700> the

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
is motion detection basically when the

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.099 
is motion detection basically when the
camera<00:02:06.060> understands<00:02:06.479> that<00:02:06.600> either<00:02:06.810> your

00:02:07.099 --> 00:02:07.109 
camera understands that either your

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:08.990 
camera understands that either your
camera<00:02:07.560> or<00:02:07.770> your<00:02:07.799> subject<00:02:08.369> are<00:02:08.460> moving<00:02:08.880> and

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
camera or your subject are moving and

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.760 
camera or your subject are moving and
there<00:02:09.390> is<00:02:09.539> motion<00:02:09.869> in<00:02:10.140> the<00:02:10.229> camera<00:02:10.530> it's<00:02:10.649> going

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
there is motion in the camera it's going

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.050 
there is motion in the camera it's going
to<00:02:10.830> automatically<00:02:11.400> crank<00:02:11.670> up<00:02:11.790> the<00:02:11.880> shutter

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
to automatically crank up the shutter

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.670 
to automatically crank up the shutter
speed<00:02:12.270> and<00:02:12.420> it's<00:02:12.630> going<00:02:12.750> to<00:02:12.810> crank<00:02:12.960> up<00:02:13.050> the<00:02:13.200> ISO

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
speed and it's going to crank up the ISO

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.370 
speed and it's going to crank up the ISO
to<00:02:14.430> give<00:02:14.610> you<00:02:14.730> that<00:02:14.970> sharper<00:02:15.450> clearer<00:02:15.840> image

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
to give you that sharper clearer image

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.229 
to give you that sharper clearer image
now<00:02:16.770> the<00:02:16.830> ISO<00:02:17.370> on<00:02:17.400> this<00:02:17.610> camera<00:02:17.820> goes<00:02:18.030> up<00:02:18.150> to

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:18.239 
now the ISO on this camera goes up to

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:21.619 
now the ISO on this camera goes up to
6400<00:02:19.230> which<00:02:19.319> is<00:02:19.440> extremely<00:02:19.980> high<00:02:20.340> as<00:02:21.090> far<00:02:21.390> as<00:02:21.510> I

00:02:21.619 --> 00:02:21.629 
6400 which is extremely high as far as I

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:22.850 
6400 which is extremely high as far as I
so<00:02:21.989> goes<00:02:22.230> and<00:02:22.349> that's<00:02:22.470> going<00:02:22.560> to<00:02:22.620> give<00:02:22.680> you

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
so goes and that's going to give you

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:23.600 
so goes and that's going to give you
some

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
some

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.730 
some
really<00:02:24.120> really<00:02:24.330> crisp<00:02:24.900> pictures<00:02:25.470> when<00:02:25.620> you're

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:25.740 
really really crisp pictures when you're

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:28.010 
really really crisp pictures when you're
shooting<00:02:25.920> in<00:02:26.670> low<00:02:27.030> light<00:02:27.060> now<00:02:27.510> you<00:02:27.570> are<00:02:27.900> going

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
shooting in low light now you are going

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:29.360 
shooting in low light now you are going
to<00:02:28.110> get<00:02:28.230> a<00:02:28.260> dirty<00:02:28.650> or<00:02:28.800> images<00:02:29.100> going<00:02:29.220> to<00:02:29.280> have

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
to get a dirty or images going to have

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.550 
to get a dirty or images going to have
more<00:02:29.550> noise<00:02:29.820> but<00:02:30.240> this<00:02:30.780> camera<00:02:31.110> does<00:02:31.350> have<00:02:31.530> a

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
more noise but this camera does have a

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.160 
more noise but this camera does have a
dual<00:02:31.920> pass<00:02:32.280> noise<00:02:33.210> reduction<00:02:33.480> system<00:02:33.840> in<00:02:34.080> it

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
dual pass noise reduction system in it

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:35.660 
dual pass noise reduction system in it
so<00:02:34.290> it's<00:02:34.410> very<00:02:34.590> good<00:02:34.800> at<00:02:34.950> that<00:02:35.070> another<00:02:35.520> cool

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
so it's very good at that another cool

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:36.920 
so it's very good at that another cool
feature<00:02:35.730> for<00:02:36.030> taking<00:02:36.210> the<00:02:36.360> sharp<00:02:36.540> photos<00:02:36.840> with

person you'll notice is it right up here

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.100 
person you'll notice is it right up here
at<00:02:50.640> the<00:02:50.670> top<00:02:50.730> you<00:02:51.030> do<00:02:51.150> have<00:02:51.300> left<00:02:51.630> and<00:02:51.840> right

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
at the top you do have left and right

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:53.870 
at the top you do have left and right
microphones<00:02:52.860> so<00:02:53.040> you<00:02:53.130> do<00:02:53.220> have<00:02:53.280> stereo<00:02:53.670> mics

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
microphones so you do have stereo mics

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.370 
microphones so you do have stereo mics
and<00:02:54.030> that<00:02:54.450> is<00:02:54.540> because<00:02:54.630> this<00:02:54.780> camera<00:02:55.110> does

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:35.580 
rechargeable batteries

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:37.040 
rechargeable batteries
and<00:04:35.699> you<00:04:36.150> can<00:04:36.270> actually<00:04:36.539> charge<00:04:36.720> them<00:04:36.990> by

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:37.050 
and you can actually charge them by

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:38.629 
and you can actually charge them by
plugging<00:04:37.319> it<00:04:37.560> in<00:04:37.650> there<00:04:37.800> or<00:04:38.009> you<00:04:38.159> can<00:04:38.310> just<00:04:38.430> run

00:04:38.629 --> 00:04:38.639 
plugging it in there or you can just run

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:41.390 
plugging it in there or you can just run
off<00:04:38.819> of<00:04:38.990> ground<00:04:39.990> pati<00:04:40.259> you<00:04:40.949> know<00:04:41.039> off<00:04:41.159> of<00:04:41.310> the

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:41.400 
off of ground pati you know off of the

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.159 
off of ground pati you know off of the
power<00:04:41.550> cord<00:04:41.939> what's<00:04:42.539> really<00:04:42.689> cool<00:04:42.900> about<00:04:42.960> this

00:04:43.159 --> 00:04:43.169 
power cord what's really cool about this

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:44.300 
power cord what's really cool about this
camera<00:04:43.470> is<00:04:43.500> that<00:04:43.590> even<00:04:43.800> though<00:04:43.949> it<00:04:44.039> only<00:04:44.069> uses

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:44.310 
camera is that even though it only uses

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:46.520 
camera is that even though it only uses
for<00:04:44.729> double<00:04:45.120> a<00:04:45.240> lithium-ion<00:04:45.719> batteries<00:04:46.199> it's

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:46.530 
for double a lithium-ion batteries it's

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:50.240 
for double a lithium-ion batteries it's
going<00:04:46.710> to<00:04:46.770> give<00:04:46.860> you<00:04:47.360> 840<00:04:48.360> images<00:04:48.930> per<00:04:49.800> charge

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:50.250 
going to give you 840 images per charge

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:51.409 
going to give you 840 images per charge
or<00:04:50.520> it's<00:04:50.610> gonna<00:04:50.669> give<00:04:50.819> you<00:04:50.879> a<00:04:50.939> full<00:04:51.120> seven

hours of 720p HD video so that's a lot

00:04:54.539 --> 00:04:57.320 
hours of 720p HD video so that's a lot
of<00:04:54.750> video<00:04:55.560> and<00:04:55.849> finally<00:04:56.849> let's<00:04:57.030> talk<00:04:57.150> a<00:04:57.210> little

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:57.330 
of video and finally let's talk a little

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:00.110 
of video and finally let's talk a little
bit<00:04:57.509> about<00:04:57.689> some<00:04:57.870> of<00:04:57.930> the<00:04:58.139> in-camera<00:04:59.120> like

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:00.120 
bit about some of the in-camera like

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:01.790 
bit about some of the in-camera like
kind<00:05:00.300> of<00:05:00.360> like<00:05:00.449> the<00:05:00.539> special<00:05:00.990> functions<00:05:01.590> let's

00:05:05.659 --> 00:05:05.669 
to find on normal cameras and I'll go

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:06.950 
to find on normal cameras and I'll go
over<00:05:05.699> those<00:05:05.909> individually<00:05:06.389> the<00:05:06.509> first<00:05:06.719> one<00:05:06.870> to

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:09.330 
tell you about is the in-camera post

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:14.089 
tell you about is the in-camera post
which<00:05:10.199> is<00:05:10.319> basically<00:05:10.710> a<00:05:12.560> couple<00:05:13.560> options<00:05:13.800> that

00:05:14.089 --> 00:05:14.099 
which is basically a couple options that

00:05:14.099 --> 00:05:15.800 
which is basically a couple options that
you<00:05:14.159> can<00:05:14.190> do<00:05:14.370> on<00:05:14.520> the<00:05:14.669> camera<00:05:15.030> once<00:05:15.629> you've

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:15.810 
you can do on the camera once you've

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:17.959 
you can do on the camera once you've
already<00:05:15.900> taken<00:05:16.139> the<00:05:16.349> photo<00:05:16.469> basically<00:05:17.129> you

00:05:17.959 --> 00:05:17.969 
already taken the photo basically you

00:05:17.969 --> 00:05:20.180 
already taken the photo basically you
can<00:05:18.210> do<00:05:18.960> red<00:05:19.289> eye<00:05:19.319> removal<00:05:19.560> which<00:05:19.919> is<00:05:20.009> pretty

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:20.190 
can do red eye removal which is pretty

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:23.390 
can do red eye removal which is pretty
cool<00:05:20.430> you<00:05:20.849> can<00:05:21.000> also<00:05:21.240> do<00:05:21.810> a<00:05:21.919> smoothing<00:05:22.919> of<00:05:23.069> skin

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:23.400 
cool you can also do a smoothing of skin

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:24.619 
cool you can also do a smoothing of skin
tone<00:05:23.610> so<00:05:23.759> if<00:05:23.819> you<00:05:23.879> took<00:05:24.000> a<00:05:24.060> portrait<00:05:24.539> of

00:05:24.619 --> 00:05:24.629 
tone so if you took a portrait of

00:05:24.629 --> 00:05:26.899 
tone so if you took a portrait of
somebody<00:05:24.840> and<00:05:25.740> you<00:05:26.099> want<00:05:26.280> to<00:05:26.400> smooth<00:05:26.729> out

00:05:26.899 --> 00:05:26.909 
somebody and you want to smooth out

00:05:26.909 --> 00:05:28.399 
somebody and you want to smooth out
their<00:05:27.150> skin<00:05:27.389> tones<00:05:27.599> even<00:05:27.990> everything<00:05:28.169> out

00:05:28.399 --> 00:05:28.409 
their skin tones even everything out

00:05:28.409 --> 00:05:30.680 
their skin tones even everything out
maybe<00:05:28.620> reduce<00:05:28.919> some<00:05:29.849> skin<00:05:30.120> and<00:05:30.210> perfection<00:05:30.629> so

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:30.690 
maybe reduce some skin and perfection so

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:31.939 
maybe reduce some skin and perfection so
you<00:05:30.810> can't<00:05:31.020> see<00:05:31.139> them<00:05:31.259> you<00:05:31.349> can<00:05:31.469> do<00:05:31.620> that<00:05:31.800> as

00:05:31.939 --> 00:05:31.949 
you can't see them you can do that as

00:05:31.949 --> 00:05:33.439 
you can't see them you can do that as
well<00:05:31.979> so<00:05:32.279> those<00:05:32.520> are<00:05:32.639> the<00:05:32.699> two<00:05:32.759> most<00:05:32.969> common

00:05:33.439 --> 00:05:33.449 
well so those are the two most common

00:05:33.449 --> 00:05:34.790 
well so those are the two most common
that<00:05:33.810> you're<00:05:33.900> going<00:05:33.990> to<00:05:34.050> be<00:05:34.169> using<00:05:34.319> is<00:05:34.620> you

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:34.800 
that you're going to be using is you

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:36.980 
that you're going to be using is you
know<00:05:34.919> the<00:05:35.219> soft<00:05:35.490> skin<00:05:35.789> and<00:05:36.000> the<00:05:36.689> red<00:05:36.960> eye

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:36.990 
know the soft skin and the red eye

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:38.510 
know the soft skin and the red eye
removal<00:05:37.259> but<00:05:37.590> there's<00:05:37.800> even<00:05:37.860> more<00:05:38.009> there's<00:05:38.370> a

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:38.520 
removal but there's even more there's a

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:40.550 
removal but there's even more there's a
continuous<00:05:39.449> mode<00:05:39.659> where<00:05:39.900> you<00:05:40.259> hold<00:05:40.440> the

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:40.560 
continuous mode where you hold the

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:41.809 
continuous mode where you hold the
shutter<00:05:40.740> down<00:05:40.889> it's<00:05:41.039> going<00:05:41.129> to<00:05:41.219> keep<00:05:41.430> taking

00:05:41.809 --> 00:05:41.819 
shutter down it's going to keep taking

00:05:41.819 --> 00:05:43.820 
shutter down it's going to keep taking
shots<00:05:42.120> of<00:05:42.560> something<00:05:43.560> that's<00:05:43.650> moving

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:43.830 
shots of something that's moving

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:45.409 
shots of something that's moving
continuously<00:05:44.190> not<00:05:44.610> doesn't<00:05:44.940> do<00:05:45.000> that<00:05:45.150> very

00:05:45.409 --> 00:05:45.419 
continuously not doesn't do that very

00:05:45.419 --> 00:05:47.959 
continuously not doesn't do that very
fast<00:05:45.750> like<00:05:45.990> a<00:05:46.020> big<00:05:46.349> professional<00:05:46.560> SLR<00:05:47.310> camera

00:05:47.959 --> 00:05:47.969 
fast like a big professional SLR camera

00:05:47.969 --> 00:05:49.550 
fast like a big professional SLR camera
does<00:05:48.539> but<00:05:48.810> it<00:05:48.930> does<00:05:49.080> have<00:05:49.199> a<00:05:49.229> really<00:05:49.440> cool

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:49.560 
does but it does have a really cool

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:51.529 
does but it does have a really cool
feature<00:05:49.620> called<00:05:49.860> sports<00:05:50.370> continuous<00:05:51.000> what<00:05:51.449> it

00:05:51.529 --> 00:05:51.539 
feature called sports continuous what it

00:05:51.539 --> 00:05:52.790 
feature called sports continuous what it
does<00:05:51.719> then<00:05:51.960> is<00:05:52.139> that<00:05:52.259> it<00:05:52.349> actually<00:05:52.469> takes<00:05:52.710> a

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:52.800 
does then is that it actually takes a

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:55.100 
does then is that it actually takes a
lower<00:05:53.099> resolution<00:05:53.969> image<00:05:54.539> but<00:05:54.750> it<00:05:54.900> does<00:05:55.020> take

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:55.110 
lower resolution image but it does take

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:57.740 
lower resolution image but it does take
120<00:05:55.919> frames<00:05:56.159> per<00:05:56.310> second<00:05:57.000> which<00:05:57.360> is<00:05:57.389> very

00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:57.750 
120 frames per second which is very

00:05:57.750 --> 00:05:58.850 
120 frames per second which is very
intense<00:05:58.020> you're<00:05:58.259> going<00:05:58.379> to<00:05:58.440> get<00:05:58.500> lots<00:05:58.740> of

00:05:58.850 --> 00:05:58.860 
intense you're going to get lots of

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:00.140 
intense you're going to get lots of
little<00:05:59.159> tiny<00:05:59.310> pictures<00:05:59.729> but<00:05:59.849> you're<00:05:59.969> going<00:06:00.089> to

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:00.150 
little tiny pictures but you're going to

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:01.790 
little tiny pictures but you're going to
get<00:06:00.270> all<00:06:00.449> that<00:06:00.719> action<00:06:00.990> that's<00:06:01.349> happening<00:06:01.409> so

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:01.800 
get all that action that's happening so

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:03.079 
get all that action that's happening so
if<00:06:01.889> let's<00:06:02.310> say<00:06:02.370> somebody<00:06:02.580> was<00:06:02.729> hitting<00:06:03.029> a

00:06:03.079 --> 00:06:03.089 
if let's say somebody was hitting a

00:06:03.089 --> 00:06:04.730

baseball you're going to get an image of
each<00:06:04.860> part<00:06:05.729> of<00:06:05.849> the<00:06:05.940> swing<00:06:06.509> as<00:06:06.690> the<00:06:06.930> baseball

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:07.080

too big it's not too small it's got a
little<00:06:18.659> bit<00:06:18.990> more<00:06:19.229> because<00:06:20.129> it<00:06:20.190> does<00:06:20.310> shoot

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:20.460 
little bit more because it does shoot

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:22.820 
little bit more because it does shoot
720p<00:06:20.789> video<00:06:21.360> this<00:06:21.479> is<00:06:21.569> a<00:06:21.629> 12<00:06:21.930> megapixel<00:06:22.080> sensor

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:22.830 
720p video this is a 12 megapixel sensor

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:24.260 
720p video this is a 12 megapixel sensor
of<00:06:22.949> very<00:06:23.190> high<00:06:23.370> so<00:06:23.729> so<00:06:23.849> it's<00:06:23.909> a<00:06:24.000> little<00:06:24.180> bit

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:24.270 
of very high so so it's a little bit

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:26.149 
of very high so so it's a little bit
more<00:06:24.449> powerful<00:06:24.930> than<00:06:25.469> let's<00:06:25.680> say<00:06:25.770> a<00:06:25.830> really

00:06:26.149 --> 00:06:26.159 
more powerful than let's say a really

00:06:26.159 --> 00:06:27.740 
more powerful than let's say a really
small<00:06:26.339> point<00:06:26.610> and<00:06:26.729> shoot<00:06:26.879> but<00:06:27.089> as<00:06:27.330> you<00:06:27.479> can<00:06:27.569> see

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:27.750 
small point and shoot but as you can see

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:29.450 
small point and shoot but as you can see
it's<00:06:27.960> not<00:06:28.169> a<00:06:28.199> huge<00:06:28.529> camera<00:06:28.889> it's<00:06:29.099> definitely
