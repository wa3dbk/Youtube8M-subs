00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:14.040
 Well, many people have liked it since 

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:17.609
 saw the ruby video use this server 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:19.550
 playing posters lapse the pit bikes 

00:02:17.609 --> 00:02:21.560
 pinball let's go 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:23.630
 and Cuba in kraft lobby or these are 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.500
 here I'm going to go to the one I like the most 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:30.620
 is that 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:32.900
 I do not know if it will dodge only the aleph 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:35.150
 I'm going to Stewart, I have not done that for a long time 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:37.129
 a campaign is not going it seems that you are a lawyer 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.780
 Now that I'll have to go I think 

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:40.310
 what is this here if it does not have a little 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.200
 of lag 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:43.459
 Well, I do not know why it's because I want to 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.989
 say what happens with action every time 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:47.840
 that I record with action ball passes this vale 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:49.670
 this someone puts you worth is worth very well 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.260
 the times that I have won the cattle 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:54.340
 months that have already died all those who 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:56.760
 you have noticed and all this all very process 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:59.720
 subtracting things 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.720
 to the posts 

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:07.680
 here 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:07.680
 ok we are entering 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:14.010
 do not bother me 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:23.849
 and the chests are empty 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:23.849
 I believe that I should not be here 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:29.440
 what's happening nigga good seems to be 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:32.720
 which is that it does not go because I 've already 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:35.550
 got into six games and is who 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:38.880
 come on if you want I can not put in another 

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:41.770
 played because they look like villas but 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:43.960
 players is impossible let's go here 

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:46.600
 is that I do not know I do not know what's happening here 

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:47.580
 but good I will teach another thing of this 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:48.960
 server 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:50.430
 I hope we do this in some 

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:55.100
 moment if you ever get caught 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:56.720
 something like putting the key and solving it beep 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:58.670
 and well this is the one we have entered 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:01.070
 let's hope this goes well and that 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:03.080
 This ship has been and everything is going well and 

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:04.760
 start in 10 seconds if you're the 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:06.620
 moment is a bit strange because I do not know 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:08.540
 why will it be because I believe that already 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:10.520
 You should be commenting well after 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:11.900

00:04:54.809 --> 00:04:58.369
