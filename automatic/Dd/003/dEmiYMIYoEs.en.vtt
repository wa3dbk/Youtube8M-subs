starts with E 4 and then Knight f6 the
other<00:00:36.630> kinds<00:00:36.930> defense<00:00:37.350> the<00:00:38.340> idea<00:00:38.610> being<00:00:38.850> to

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
other kinds defense the idea being to

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.810 
other kinds defense the idea being to
lure<00:00:39.450> white<00:00:39.930> spawns<00:00:40.379> forward<00:00:40.950> and<00:00:41.219> then

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
lure white spawns forward and then

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.420 
lure white spawns forward and then
hopefully<00:00:42.090> attack<00:00:42.989> them<00:00:43.290> em<00:00:43.469> as<00:00:44.040> they<00:00:44.190> become

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
hopefully attack them em as they become

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.670 
hopefully attack them em as they become
too<00:00:44.670> far<00:00:44.940> advanced<00:00:45.539> but<00:00:46.320> it's<00:00:46.410> normally<00:00:46.649> a

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
too far advanced but it's normally a

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.470 
too far advanced but it's normally a
good<00:00:46.829> idea<00:00:47.070> not<00:00:47.129> to<00:00:47.340> fall<00:00:48.090> in<00:00:48.239> with<00:00:48.360> your

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
good idea not to fall in with your

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.200 
good idea not to fall in with your
opponent's<00:00:48.930> plans<00:00:49.230> to<00:00:49.530> readily<00:00:49.890> and<00:00:50.129> so<00:00:51.000> why

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
opponent's plans to readily and so why

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.380 
opponent's plans to readily and so why
it<00:00:51.270> just<00:00:51.539> simply<00:00:51.750> plays<00:00:52.079> Knight<00:00:52.379> c3<00:00:52.620> and<00:00:53.390> after

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
it just simply plays Knight c3 and after

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.689 
it just simply plays Knight c3 and after
the<00:00:54.449> next<00:00:54.570> few<00:00:54.989> moves<00:00:55.230> were<00:00:56.010> back<00:00:56.219> into<00:00:56.670> a

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
the next few moves were back into a

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.099 
the next few moves were back into a
regular<00:00:57.109> four<00:00:58.109> nights<00:00:58.350> opening<00:00:59.960> now<00:01:00.960> there's

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
regular four nights opening now there's

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
been played for hundreds of years so

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.050 
been played for hundreds of years so
there's<00:01:04.049> quite<00:01:04.409> a<00:01:04.439> well-developed<00:01:05.400> theory<00:01:06.000> in

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
there's quite a well-developed theory in

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.870 
there's quite a well-developed theory in
it<00:01:06.210> and<00:01:08.090> after<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.210> next<00:01:09.510> few<00:01:09.720> moves<00:01:10.729> we<00:01:11.729> reach

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
it and after the next few moves we reach

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.780 
it and after the next few moves we reach
a<00:01:12.030> position<00:01:12.210> where<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:13.710> normal<00:01:14.100> response<00:01:14.220> for

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
a position where the normal response for

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.749 
a position where the normal response for
black<00:01:15.000> is<00:01:15.299> simply<00:01:16.080> to<00:01:16.229> play<00:01:16.470> Queen<00:01:17.340> takes<00:01:17.580> pawn

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
black is simply to play Queen takes pawn

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:22.010 
black is simply to play Queen takes pawn
and<00:01:18.530> after<00:01:19.530> white<00:01:19.920> captures<00:01:20.220> on<00:01:20.549> c3<00:01:20.810> black<00:01:21.810> as

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
and after white captures on c3 black as

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.340 
and after white captures on c3 black as
a<00:01:22.049> smooth<00:01:22.500> Queen<00:01:22.799> eg5<00:01:23.159> check<00:01:24.020> there's<00:01:25.020> a<00:01:25.080> check

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
a smooth Queen eg5 check there's a check

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.039 
a smooth Queen eg5 check there's a check
it's<00:01:25.710> threatening<00:01:26.040> to<00:01:26.130> take<00:01:26.220> bishop<00:01:26.670> on<00:01:26.790> b5<00:01:27.270> so

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
it's threatening to take bishop on b5 so

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.420 
it's threatening to take bishop on b5 so
why<00:01:28.170> does<00:01:28.350> kind<00:01:28.560> of<00:01:28.650> force<00:01:28.920> to<00:01:28.979> exchange

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
why does kind of force to exchange

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.060 
why does kind of force to exchange
Queens<00:01:29.820> and<00:01:30.119> you<00:01:30.600> get<00:01:30.750> a<00:01:30.780> very<00:01:30.960> equal<00:01:31.710> looking

those<00:04:18.539> pieces<00:04:19.340> Queen<00:04:20.340> check<00:04:20.609> King<00:04:21.269> in<00:04:21.390> the

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:21.450 
those pieces Queen check King in the

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:23.930 
those pieces Queen check King in the
middle<00:04:21.720> and<00:04:21.979> white<00:04:22.979> almost<00:04:23.340> two<00:04:23.580> pieces<00:04:23.910> left

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
middle and white almost two pieces left

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:25.880 
middle and white almost two pieces left
but<00:04:24.360> that's<00:04:24.510> all<00:04:24.750> we<00:04:24.840> needs<00:04:25.050> to<00:04:25.560> provide<00:04:25.710> a

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:25.890 
but that's all we needs to provide a

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:27.499 
but that's all we needs to provide a
mate

00:04:27.499 --> 00:04:27.509 
mate

00:04:27.509 --> 00:04:30.840 
mate
so<00:04:28.509> if<00:04:29.289> we<00:04:29.470> move<00:04:29.650> back<00:04:29.860> you<00:04:30.340> see<00:04:30.550> that<00:04:30.699> that's

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:30.850 
so if we move back you see that that's

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:34.439 
so if we move back you see that that's
why<00:04:31.259> in<00:04:32.259> this<00:04:32.500> position<00:04:32.979> black<00:04:33.880> is<00:04:34.060> not<00:04:34.270> able

00:04:34.439 --> 00:04:34.449 
why in this position black is not able

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:38.129 
why in this position black is not able
to<00:04:34.780> capture<00:04:35.110> the<00:04:35.380> bishop<00:04:35.710> on<00:04:35.860> b5<00:04:36.840> so<00:04:37.840> he<00:04:37.930> wants

00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:38.139 
to capture the bishop on b5 so he wants

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:39.510 
to capture the bishop on b5 so he wants
to<00:04:38.199> get<00:04:38.319> us<00:04:38.470> Cling<00:04:38.680> a<00:04:38.770> little<00:04:38.949> bit<00:04:39.039> safer<00:04:39.430> than

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:39.520 
to get us Cling a little bit safer than

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:43.409 
to get us Cling a little bit safer than
is<00:04:39.699> currently<00:04:39.970> three<00:04:40.449> castles<00:04:41.910> but<00:04:42.910> again<00:04:43.180> the

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:43.419 
is currently three castles but again the

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:46.379 
is currently three castles but again the
awkward<00:04:43.900> position<00:04:44.050> of<00:04:44.380> black<00:04:45.190> screen<00:04:45.639> allows

00:04:46.379 --> 00:04:46.389 
awkward position of black screen allows

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:50.520 
awkward position of black screen allows
white<00:04:46.750> to<00:04:46.979> develop<00:04:47.979> further<00:04:48.580> with<00:04:49.120> temple<00:04:49.630> so

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:50.530 
white to develop further with temple so

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:52.469 
white to develop further with temple so
he<00:04:50.560> attacks<00:04:50.860> the<00:04:50.979> Queen<00:04:51.280> Queen<00:04:51.729> must<00:04:51.910> move<00:04:52.090> and

he attacks the Queen Queen must move and

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:55.680 
he attacks the Queen Queen must move and
this<00:04:53.259> magic<00:04:53.919> brook<00:04:54.190> shoots<00:04:54.789> along<00:04:55.150> attacks

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:55.690 
this magic brook shoots along attacks

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:58.920 
this magic brook shoots along attacks
the<00:04:55.870> Queen<00:04:56.080> again<00:04:56.380> and<00:04:57.120> queens<00:04:58.120> how<00:04:58.660> they<00:04:58.810> got

00:04:58.920 --> 00:04:58.930 
the Queen again and queens how they got

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:00.480 
the Queen again and queens how they got
any<00:04:59.110> squares<00:04:59.530> to<00:04:59.740> move<00:04:59.889> to<00:05:00.039> now<00:05:00.160> it's<00:05:00.280> almost

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:00.490 
any squares to move to now it's almost

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:04.980 
any squares to move to now it's almost
trapped<00:05:01.229> if<00:05:02.229> it<00:05:02.470> was<00:05:02.560> to<00:05:02.710> move<00:05:02.889> to<00:05:03.190> e4<00:05:03.990> then

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:04.990 
trapped if it was to move to e4 then

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:07.890 
trapped if it was to move to e4 then
white<00:05:05.380> could<00:05:05.590> just<00:05:05.740> play<00:05:05.889> Bishop<00:05:06.099> d3<00:05:06.460> and<00:05:07.000> then

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:07.900 
white could just play Bishop d3 and then

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:10.200 
white could just play Bishop d3 and then
when<00:05:08.050> the<00:05:08.110> Queen<00:05:08.320> moves<00:05:08.500> again<00:05:08.800> h7<00:05:09.490> is<00:05:09.699> hanging

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:10.210 
when the Queen moves again h7 is hanging

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:13.260 
when the Queen moves again h7 is hanging
so<00:05:10.539> that's<00:05:10.720> no<00:05:10.930> good<00:05:11.400> so<00:05:12.400> the<00:05:12.460> only<00:05:12.580> other<00:05:12.880> safe

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:13.270 
so that's no good so the only other safe

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:15.150 
so that's no good so the only other safe
square<00:05:13.599> for<00:05:13.840> black<00:05:14.020> is<00:05:14.320> to<00:05:14.500> put<00:05:14.680> the<00:05:14.770> Queen<00:05:15.009> on

f4 but no rest for the wicked there

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.730 
f4 but no rest for the wicked there
should<00:05:19.150> be<00:05:19.180> five<00:05:19.539> disturbing<00:05:20.349> the<00:05:20.440> screen

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:20.740 
should be five disturbing the screen

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:24.029 
should be five disturbing the screen
again<00:05:21.039> and<00:05:21.509> obviously<00:05:22.509> again<00:05:22.900> can't<00:05:23.320> go<00:05:23.470> to<00:05:23.530> e4

00:05:24.029 --> 00:05:24.039 
again and obviously again can't go to e4

00:05:24.039 --> 00:05:26.520 
again and obviously again can't go to e4
cause<00:05:24.280> of<00:05:24.400> Bishop<00:05:24.639> d3<00:05:24.849> so<00:05:25.720> the<00:05:25.840> Queen<00:05:26.020> has<00:05:26.259> to

move to be four so only other safe
square<00:05:29.520> and<00:05:30.840> now<00:05:31.840> you<00:05:31.900> see<00:05:32.229> that<00:05:32.259> White's

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:32.560

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:34.439 
square and now you see that White's
pieces<00:05:32.979> are<00:05:33.070> all<00:05:33.099> mast<00:05:33.430> against<00:05:34.090> the<00:05:34.210> black
