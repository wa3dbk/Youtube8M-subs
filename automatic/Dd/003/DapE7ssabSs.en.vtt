Meyer what's this thing it's a YikeBike
it's<00:00:37.980> a<00:00:38.100> new<00:00:38.280> form<00:00:38.640> of<00:00:38.700> personal

transportation<00:00:39.600> and<00:00:40.170> today<00:00:40.410> we're<00:00:40.710> checking

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
transportation and today we're checking

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.220 
transportation and today we're checking
it<00:00:41.100> out

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:45.230 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:47.260

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:47.270 
so you might remember those bikes from

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:48.550 
so you might remember those bikes from
back<00:00:47.480> in<00:00:47.510> the<00:00:47.750> day<00:00:47.930> there<00:00:48.200> were<00:00:48.290> penny

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:48.560 
back in the day there were penny

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:49.960 
back in the day there were penny
farthings<00:00:49.220> they<00:00:49.430> were<00:00:49.520> the<00:00:49.640> ones<00:00:49.790> with<00:00:49.940> the

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:49.970 
farthings they were the ones with the

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:51.760 
farthings they were the ones with the
big<00:00:50.240> wheels<00:00:50.450> up<00:00:50.720> front<00:00:50.990> the<00:00:51.170> small<00:00:51.440> one<00:00:51.620> in<00:00:51.710> the

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:51.770 
big wheels up front the small one in the

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:54.100 
big wheels up front the small one in the
back<00:00:51.980> this<00:00:52.550> is<00:00:52.760> similar<00:00:53.000> to<00:00:53.180> that<00:00:53.300> in<00:00:53.660> design

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:54.110 
back this is similar to that in design

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:56.560 
back this is similar to that in design
but<00:00:54.830> the<00:00:54.950> purpose<00:00:55.310> of<00:00:55.430> this<00:00:55.610> is<00:00:55.880> all<00:00:56.210> about

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:56.570 
but the purpose of this is all about

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:59.080 
but the purpose of this is all about
mobility<00:00:57.500> it's<00:00:57.950> all<00:00:58.070> about<00:00:58.250> functionality

00:00:59.080 --> 00:00:59.090 
mobility it's all about functionality

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:00.430 
mobility it's all about functionality
and<00:00:59.210> efficiency<00:00:59.330> you<00:00:59.780> can<00:00:59.810> fold<00:01:00.200> this<00:01:00.380> thing

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:00.440 
and efficiency you can fold this thing

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.700 
and efficiency you can fold this thing
up<00:01:00.830> it<00:01:01.160> weighs<00:01:01.280> about<00:01:01.460> 22<00:01:02.210> pounds<00:01:02.780> put<00:01:03.500> it<00:01:03.590> on<00:01:03.680> a

up it weighs about 22 pounds put it on a

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:05.110 
up it weighs about 22 pounds put it on a
strap<00:01:04.070> or<00:01:04.280> you<00:01:04.370> can<00:01:04.489> just<00:01:04.610> put<00:01:04.790> your<00:01:04.820> hand

up and go someone might look at this

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:10.420 
up and go someone might look at this
thing<00:01:08.630> and<00:01:08.780> think<00:01:08.960> well<00:01:09.110> I<00:01:09.140> can't<00:01:09.830> I'm<00:01:10.250> not

little bit about how all this started
how<00:01:39.500> you<00:01:39.560> guys<00:01:39.800> went<00:01:40.100> from<00:01:40.310> an<00:01:40.670> idea<00:01:41.060> to<00:01:41.149> this

thing I'm grown Ryan the CEO of yoke
bite<00:01:45.440> came<00:01:45.920> up<00:01:46.100> with<00:01:46.310> an<00:01:46.430> idea<00:01:46.759> that<00:01:46.820> he<00:01:47.300> needed

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:47.570 
bite came up with an idea that he needed

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:51.010 
bite came up with an idea that he needed
a<00:01:47.810> new<00:01:48.080> form<00:01:48.979> of<00:01:49.220> urban<00:01:49.550> transport<00:01:50.270> but<00:01:50.929> he

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
a new form of urban transport but he

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:52.620 
a new form of urban transport but he
wanted<00:01:51.319> it<00:01:51.470> to<00:01:51.530> make<00:01:51.830> it<00:01:51.979> the<00:01:52.100> smallest

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:52.630 
wanted it to make it the smallest

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:55.150 
wanted it to make it the smallest
lightest<00:01:53.630> folding<00:01:54.289> bicycle<00:01:54.800> in<00:01:54.890> the<00:01:54.979> world

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:55.160 
lightest folding bicycle in the world

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:56.889 
lightest folding bicycle in the world
you<00:01:55.580> guys<00:01:55.729> kind<00:01:55.970> of<00:01:56.000> have<00:01:56.149> two<00:01:56.390> versions<00:01:56.810> of

00:01:56.889 --> 00:01:56.899 
you guys kind of have two versions of

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:58.210 
you guys kind of have two versions of
these<00:01:57.020> right<00:01:57.229> one<00:01:57.440> that's<00:01:57.619> a<00:01:57.679> carbon<00:01:57.979> fiber

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:58.220 
these right one that's a carbon fiber

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.419 
these right one that's a carbon fiber
which<00:01:58.520> by<00:01:58.670> the<00:01:58.729> way<00:01:58.819> looks<00:01:59.060> awesome<00:01:59.509> Batman's

00:02:00.419 --> 00:02:00.429 
which by the way looks awesome Batman's

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:03.249 
which by the way looks awesome Batman's
reclinable<00:02:01.429> getaway<00:02:01.910> car<00:02:02.149> so<00:02:02.899> this<00:02:03.020> is<00:02:03.170> the

00:02:03.249 --> 00:02:03.259 
reclinable getaway car so this is the

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:05.020 
reclinable getaway car so this is the
carbon<00:02:03.440> fiber<00:02:03.770> and<00:02:04.069> then<00:02:04.250> there's<00:02:04.459> a<00:02:04.520> version

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.030 
carbon fiber and then there's a version

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.590 
carbon fiber and then there's a version
called<00:02:05.420> a<00:02:05.509> fusion<00:02:05.929> which<00:02:06.289> is<00:02:06.319> a<00:02:06.500> copolymer

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:07.600 
called a fusion which is a copolymer

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.540 
called a fusion which is a copolymer
composite<00:02:08.600> version<00:02:08.869> with<00:02:09.319> a<00:02:09.350> aluminum<00:02:10.069> frame

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550 
composite version with a aluminum frame

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:12.760 
composite version with a aluminum frame
which<00:02:11.300> will<00:02:11.420> be<00:02:11.540> heavier<00:02:11.840> obviously<00:02:12.470> but<00:02:12.680> it's

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:12.770 
which will be heavier obviously but it's

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:15.300 
which will be heavier obviously but it's
going<00:02:12.860> to<00:02:12.920> cost<00:02:13.069> less<00:02:13.370> the<00:02:13.700> carbon<00:02:14.090> version<00:02:14.480> is

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
going to cost less the carbon version is

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:18.010 
going to cost less the carbon version is
$3,800<00:02:16.310> okay<00:02:16.700> and<00:02:16.970> the<00:02:17.150> fusion<00:02:17.390> version<00:02:17.870> is

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:18.020 
$3,800 okay and the fusion version is

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:22.110 
$3,800 okay and the fusion version is
just<00:02:18.650> under<00:02:18.890> $2,000

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.910 

on<00:02:23.120> here<00:02:23.480> there's<00:02:23.690> regenerative<00:02:24.349> braking<00:02:24.800> in

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
on here there's regenerative braking in

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.949 
on here there's regenerative braking in
the<00:02:25.010> front<00:02:25.310> so<00:02:25.849> when<00:02:26.000> you<00:02:26.090> simply<00:02:26.360> let<00:02:26.569> off<00:02:26.750> the

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:26.959 
the front so when you simply let off the

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:29.229 
the front so when you simply let off the
accelerator<00:02:27.830> the<00:02:28.099> bike<00:02:28.459> begins<00:02:28.760> to<00:02:28.880> slow<00:02:29.090> down

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:29.239 
accelerator the bike begins to slow down

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:31.330 
accelerator the bike begins to slow down
on<00:02:29.450> its<00:02:29.599> own<00:02:29.750> you<00:02:30.290> can't<00:02:30.500> come<00:02:30.739> to<00:02:30.860> a<00:02:30.890> complete

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
on its own you can't come to a complete

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.910 
on its own you can't come to a complete
stop<00:02:31.610> using<00:02:31.910> the<00:02:32.150> brakes<00:02:32.390> it's<00:02:33.349> only<00:02:33.560> meant<00:02:33.830> to

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
stop using the brakes it's only meant to

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.740 
stop using the brakes it's only meant to
slow<00:02:34.130> you<00:02:34.190> down<00:02:34.340> so<00:02:34.790> going<00:02:35.180> down<00:02:35.270> that<00:02:35.569> hill

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
slow you down so going down that hill

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:36.160 
slow you down so going down that hill
there

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
there

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:38.229 
there
I<00:02:36.200> couldn't<00:02:36.680> have<00:02:36.770> just<00:02:36.950> stopped<00:02:37.280> if<00:02:37.670> an

00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:38.239 
I couldn't have just stopped if an

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:39.670 
I couldn't have just stopped if an
alligator<00:02:38.480> ran<00:02:38.989> in<00:02:39.140> front<00:02:39.319> of<00:02:39.410> me<00:02:39.500> for

the handle bars which are ingeniously
placed<00:02:51.440> behind<00:02:51.920> you<00:02:52.160> in<00:02:52.489> case<00:02:52.700> something<00:02:53.209> were

to happen and I had to stop abruptly I

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:59.979 
to happen and I had to stop abruptly I
could<00:02:55.880> just<00:02:56.480> step<00:02:56.720> right<00:02:56.930> off<00:02:57.170> no<00:02:58.090> problem<00:02:59.090> the

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:02.600 
turning radius is really limited by this

turning radius is really limited by this
foot<00:03:03.080> peg<00:03:03.319> on<00:03:03.560> the<00:03:03.680> side<00:03:03.920> so<00:03:04.549> it's<00:03:04.670> not<00:03:04.790> like

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:04.970 
foot peg on the side so it's not like

foot peg on the side so it's not like
you're<00:03:05.120> going<00:03:05.239> to<00:03:05.299> take<00:03:05.450> this<00:03:05.600> thing<00:03:05.840> and<00:03:06.110> make

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
you're going to take this thing and make

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:07.690 
you're going to take this thing and make
quick<00:03:06.500> turns<00:03:06.530> but<00:03:06.920> you're<00:03:07.040> only<00:03:07.160> going<00:03:07.400> about

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:07.700 
quick turns but you're only going about

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.740 
quick turns but you're only going about
12<00:03:07.970> miles<00:03:08.209> an<00:03:08.480> hour<00:03:09.519> it's<00:03:10.519> a<00:03:10.640> lot<00:03:10.819> of<00:03:10.850> fun<00:03:11.150> the

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
12 miles an hour it's a lot of fun the

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:13.300 
12 miles an hour it's a lot of fun the
acceleration<00:03:12.500> on<00:03:12.620> it<00:03:12.769> because<00:03:13.040> it's<00:03:13.190> an

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
acceleration on it because it's an

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:15.280 
acceleration on it because it's an
electric<00:03:13.670> motor<00:03:13.910> a<00:03:14.180> little<00:03:14.390> bit<00:03:15.200> of

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
electric motor a little bit of

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:15.699 
electric motor a little bit of
get-up-and-go

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:15.709 
get-up-and-go

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:18.309 
get-up-and-go
it's<00:03:16.700> not<00:03:17.000> the<00:03:17.180> most<00:03:17.299> comfortable<00:03:17.810> thing<00:03:18.080> you

00:03:18.309 --> 00:03:18.319 
it's not the most comfortable thing you

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:21.070 
it's not the most comfortable thing you
can<00:03:18.470> see<00:03:18.680> being<00:03:19.010> on<00:03:19.160> here<00:03:19.340> for<00:03:19.549> more<00:03:19.850> than<00:03:20.080> 20

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:21.080 
can see being on here for more than 20

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:23.289 
can see being on here for more than 20
minutes<00:03:21.350> or<00:03:21.530> so<00:03:21.739> your<00:03:22.250> bum<00:03:22.610> would<00:03:22.880> start<00:03:23.180> to

00:03:23.289 --> 00:03:23.299 
minutes or so your bum would start to

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:25.509 
minutes or so your bum would start to
hurt<00:03:23.510> but<00:03:24.140> once<00:03:24.440> you<00:03:24.530> get<00:03:24.620> past<00:03:24.680> those<00:03:25.130> simple

00:03:25.509 --> 00:03:25.519 
hurt but once you get past those simple

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:27.640 
hurt but once you get past those simple
facts<00:03:25.760> it<00:03:26.359> makes<00:03:26.630> a<00:03:26.720> lot<00:03:26.840> of<00:03:26.900> sense<00:03:27.230> and<00:03:27.500> it's

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650 
facts it makes a lot of sense and it's

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:37.070 
facts it makes a lot of sense and it's
fun

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:37.080 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:40.320 

you<00:03:38.080> guys<00:03:38.230> have<00:03:38.440> a<00:03:38.470> bit<00:03:38.860> of<00:03:38.890> a<00:03:39.010> covert<00:03:39.520> history

with with the Ike back right so tell me
a<00:03:42.070> little<00:03:42.160> bit<00:03:42.280> about<00:03:42.400> the<00:03:42.580> beginnings<00:03:42.940> there

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.150 
a little bit about the beginnings there

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:45.960 
a little bit about the beginnings there
yeah<00:03:43.930> it<00:03:43.990> was<00:03:44.200> very<00:03:44.230> closed<00:03:44.830> doors<00:03:45.100> we<00:03:45.790> can

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:45.970 
yeah it was very closed doors we can

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:48.030 
yeah it was very closed doors we can
tell<00:03:46.390> anybody<00:03:46.600> what<00:03:46.900> we<00:03:47.050> were<00:03:47.200> doing<00:03:47.560> wife

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:50.350 
know what she what I went off she didn't

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:51.720 
know what she what I went off she didn't
know<00:03:50.440> even<00:03:50.770> while<00:03:50.890> you're<00:03:51.010> doing<00:03:51.280> not<00:03:51.490> so<00:03:51.670> the

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:51.730

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:54.160 
first that's that was good fun and then

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.490 
first that's that was good fun and then
it<00:03:54.340> was<00:03:54.490> all<00:03:54.670> down<00:03:55.000> to<00:03:55.030> hell<00:03:55.540> the<00:03:55.780> life<00:03:56.200> is

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:56.500 
it was all down to hell the life is

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.800 
it was all down to hell the life is
released<00:03:56.950> into<00:03:57.460> the<00:03:57.550> world<00:03:57.760> and<00:03:58.000> we<00:03:58.600> didn't

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:58.810 
released into the world and we didn't

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:01.830 
released into the world and we didn't
want<00:03:58.900> any<00:03:59.140> media<00:03:59.530> getting<00:03:59.800> an<00:04:00.160> idea<00:04:00.550> of<00:04:00.840> what

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840 
want any media getting an idea of what

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:04.530 
want any media getting an idea of what
it<00:04:01.990> was<00:04:02.110> what<00:04:02.380> we<00:04:02.530> were<00:04:02.709> designing<00:04:03.240> so<00:04:04.240> where

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:04.540 
it was what we were designing so where

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:05.760 
it was what we were designing so where
do<00:04:04.600> you<00:04:04.660> guys<00:04:04.750> go<00:04:04.990> from<00:04:05.170> here<00:04:05.350> I<00:04:05.470> mean<00:04:05.620> are<00:04:05.709> they

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:05.770 
do you guys go from here I mean are they

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:07.350 
do you guys go from here I mean are they
going<00:04:05.800> to<00:04:05.980> be<00:04:06.100> quicker<00:04:06.580> more<00:04:06.940> efficient

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:07.360 
going to be quicker more efficient

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:09.480 
going to be quicker more efficient
lighter<00:04:07.690> you<00:04:08.200> gonna<00:04:08.320> put<00:04:08.470> wings<00:04:08.680> is<00:04:09.310> that

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:09.490 
lighter you gonna put wings is that

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:11.340 
lighter you gonna put wings is that
something<00:04:09.820> maybe<00:04:09.850> in<00:04:10.180> the<00:04:10.270> future<00:04:10.390> there<00:04:11.230> will
