this<00:00:53.460> is<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:53.960> furthest<00:00:54.960> tip<00:00:55.110> it<00:00:55.800> can<00:00:56.219> go<00:00:56.399> not

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
this is the furthest tip it can go not

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.400 
this is the furthest tip it can go not
more<00:00:57.390> than<00:00:57.510> that<00:00:57.980> anyway<00:00:59.809> this<00:01:00.809> amp<00:01:01.109> is<00:01:01.379> a

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
more than that anyway this amp is a

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:22.520 
more than that anyway this amp is a
