picture<00:02:16.650> you<00:02:16.830> fixed<00:02:17.220> on<00:02:17.310> the<00:02:17.400> subject<00:02:19.040> so<00:02:20.040> it

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
picture you fixed on the subject so it

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.390 
picture you fixed on the subject so it
can<00:02:20.310> take<00:02:20.430> pictures<00:02:20.700> like<00:02:21.090> these<00:02:21.420> lovely

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
can take pictures like these lovely

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.039 
can take pictures like these lovely
meanwhile<00:02:23.400> in<00:02:23.700> the<00:02:23.970> case<00:02:24.209> of<00:02:24.239> the<00:02:24.540> next<00:02:24.870> five

00:02:25.039 --> 00:02:25.049 
meanwhile in the case of the next five

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:27.470 
meanwhile in the case of the next five
you<00:02:25.739> can't<00:02:26.069> see<00:02:26.340> the<00:02:26.459> subject<00:02:26.730> when<00:02:27.150> you<00:02:27.269> set

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
you can't see the subject when you set

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.449 
you can't see the subject when you set
the<00:02:27.630> menu<00:02:27.930> so<00:02:28.319> it<00:02:28.470> fails<00:02:28.739> to<00:02:28.980> capture<00:02:29.130> the

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
the menu so it fails to capture the

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:31.850 
the menu so it fails to capture the
moment<00:02:29.849> while<00:02:30.000> adjusting<00:02:30.120> to<00:02:30.720> the<00:02:30.840> menu<00:02:31.170> now

let's<00:02:32.099> look<00:02:32.250> at<00:02:32.370> the<00:02:32.519> pictures<00:02:32.880> taken<00:02:33.329> this<00:02:33.989> is

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
let's look at the pictures taken this is

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.130 
let's look at the pictures taken this is

next five has good sensitivity of the

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:41.509 
next five has good sensitivity of the
noise<00:02:39.480> but<00:02:40.200> we<00:02:40.319> can<00:02:40.500> see<00:02:40.709> several<00:02:40.950> purple

pictures<00:03:10.579> nx100<00:03:11.579> is<00:03:12.060> better<00:03:12.359> than<00:03:12.599> the<00:03:12.780> next

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
pictures nx100 is better than the next

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.319 
pictures nx100 is better than the next
five<00:03:13.260> the<00:03:13.920> difference<00:03:14.280> has<00:03:14.459> grown<00:03:14.760> to<00:03:15.090> go<00:03:15.269> to

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:15.329 
five the difference has grown to go to

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:17.750 
five the difference has grown to go to
the<00:03:15.540> edges<00:03:15.900> of<00:03:16.019> the<00:03:16.109> pictures<00:03:16.620> also<00:03:16.950> in<00:03:17.579> low

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
the edges of the pictures also in low

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.430 
the edges of the pictures also in low
value<00:03:18.120> of<00:03:18.239> aperture<00:03:18.690> the<00:03:18.900> difference<00:03:19.260> has

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
value of aperture the difference has

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.420 
value of aperture the difference has
grown<00:03:19.739> too<00:03:21.410> okay<00:03:22.410> so<00:03:22.470> sometimes<00:03:23.069> you<00:03:23.190> can't

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
grown too okay so sometimes you can't

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:24.470 
grown too okay so sometimes you can't
charge<00:03:23.639> the<00:03:23.790> battery<00:03:24.060> when<00:03:24.239> you're<00:03:24.359> outside

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
charge the battery when you're outside

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.390 
charge the battery when you're outside
so<00:03:24.989> let's<00:03:25.200> take<00:03:25.410> a<00:03:25.440> look<00:03:25.650> at<00:03:25.739> the<00:03:25.829> battery<00:03:26.190> life

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
so let's take a look at the battery life

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.870 
so let's take a look at the battery life
I<00:03:26.700> have<00:03:27.569> taken<00:03:27.810> a<00:03:27.989> picture<00:03:28.230> /<00:03:28.829> 30<00:03:29.160> seconds<00:03:29.760> in

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:29.880 
I have taken a picture / 30 seconds in

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.990 
I have taken a picture / 30 seconds in
the<00:03:30.060> same<00:03:30.269> condition<00:03:30.870> the<00:03:31.590> next<00:03:31.980> 5<00:03:32.220> has<00:03:32.549> taken

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
the same condition the next 5 has taken

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.759 
the same condition the next 5 has taken
a<00:03:33.150> total<00:03:33.510> of<00:03:33.569> three<00:03:33.599> hundred<00:03:34.079> and<00:03:34.380> thirty-two

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:34.769 
a total of three hundred and thirty-two

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:38.449 
a total of three hundred and thirty-two
pictures<00:03:35.430> and<00:03:35.959> nx100<00:03:36.959> has<00:03:37.530> taken<00:03:37.889> a<00:03:37.980> total<00:03:38.280> of

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
pictures and nx100 has taken a total of

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:40.159 
pictures and nx100 has taken a total of
four<00:03:38.730> hundred<00:03:39.090> and<00:03:39.209> twenty-six<00:03:39.720> pictures

00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:40.169 
four hundred and twenty-six pictures

00:03:40.169 --> 00:03:43.640 
four hundred and twenty-six pictures
with<00:03:41.040> that<00:03:41.220> said<00:03:41.579> the<00:03:41.910> nx100<00:03:42.540> is<00:03:43.109> able<00:03:43.410> to<00:03:43.470> take

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
with that said the nx100 is able to take

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:46.940 
with that said the nx100 is able to take
more<00:03:44.310> pictures<00:03:44.579> than<00:03:44.970> the<00:03:45.239> next<00:03:45.569> five<00:03:45.780> I<00:03:46.139> think

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
more pictures than the next five I think

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:47.730 
more pictures than the next five I think
this<00:03:47.099> is<00:03:47.310> because

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:47.740 
this is because

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:52.560 
this is because
the<00:03:47.920> display<00:03:49.110> nx100<00:03:50.110> has<00:03:50.770> amo<00:03:51.490> LED<00:03:51.970> display

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:52.570 
the display nx100 has amo LED display

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:56.000 
the display nx100 has amo LED display
but<00:03:53.140> next<00:03:53.350> 5<00:03:53.650> has<00:03:53.950> true<00:03:54.310> black<00:03:54.550> LCD<00:03:55.330> display

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
but next 5 has true black LCD display

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:59.430 
but next 5 has true black LCD display
amo<00:03:57.010> led<00:03:57.490> is<00:03:57.760> in<00:03:58.090> the<00:03:58.210> spotlight<00:03:58.450> as<00:03:58.840> displayed

00:03:59.430 --> 00:03:59.440 
amo led is in the spotlight as displayed

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:01.980 
amo led is in the spotlight as displayed
of<00:03:59.680> a<00:03:59.770> dream<00:04:00.300> scientists<00:04:01.300> said<00:04:01.480> we<00:04:01.810> can

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:01.990 
of a dream scientists said we can

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:05.570 
of a dream scientists said we can
substitute<00:04:02.230> amo<00:04:03.190> LED<00:04:03.730> for<00:04:04.360> LCD<00:04:04.810> in<00:04:05.080> the<00:04:05.200> future

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:05.580 
substitute amo LED for LCD in the future

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:09.240 
substitute amo LED for LCD in the future
according<00:04:06.580> to<00:04:06.610> wikipedia<00:04:07.140> amo<00:04:08.140> LED<00:04:08.620> has<00:04:08.950> many

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:09.250 
according to wikipedia amo LED has many

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:13.230 
according to wikipedia amo LED has many
benefits<00:04:09.570> the<00:04:10.570> next<00:04:10.870> 5<00:04:11.050> has<00:04:11.350> tilting<00:04:11.980> LCD<00:04:12.240> so

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:13.240 
benefits the next 5 has tilting LCD so

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:15.510 
benefits the next 5 has tilting LCD so
you<00:04:13.300> can<00:04:13.540> use<00:04:13.810> it<00:04:14.260> to<00:04:14.500> take<00:04:14.650> a<00:04:14.710> picture<00:04:14.980> of<00:04:15.280> high

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:15.520 
you can use it to take a picture of high

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:19.020 
you can use it to take a picture of high
or<00:04:15.850> low<00:04:16.180> angle<00:04:16.780> but<00:04:17.500> it<00:04:17.590> is<00:04:17.709> not<00:04:17.890> fully<00:04:18.280> back<00:04:18.610> so

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:19.030 
or low angle but it is not fully back so

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:21.590 
or low angle but it is not fully back so
