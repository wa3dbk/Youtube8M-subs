symptoms as then what happened it was
actually<00:00:27.680> just<00:00:27.740> a<00:00:27.890> few<00:00:28.010> nights<00:00:28.190> ago<00:00:28.310> I<00:00:28.730> felt

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:29.360 
actually just a few nights ago I felt

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:30.850 
actually just a few nights ago I felt
like<00:00:29.510> a<00:00:29.539> weird<00:00:29.780> spot<00:00:30.020> on<00:00:30.170> the<00:00:30.230> back<00:00:30.350> of<00:00:30.530> my<00:00:30.650> head

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:30.860 
like a weird spot on the back of my head

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:34.360 
like a weird spot on the back of my head
um<00:00:31.090> constantly<00:00:32.090> rubbing<00:00:32.210> it<00:00:32.509> in<00:00:32.989> its<00:00:33.590> unit<00:00:33.920> not

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:34.370 
um constantly rubbing it in its unit not

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:35.920 
um constantly rubbing it in its unit not
really<00:00:34.640> understanding<00:00:35.360> what<00:00:35.510> was<00:00:35.600> going<00:00:35.840> on

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:35.930 
really understanding what was going on

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:38.889 
really understanding what was going on
um<00:00:36.170> I<00:00:36.710> thought<00:00:37.520> perhaps<00:00:37.820> it<00:00:38.180> was<00:00:38.300> just<00:00:38.450> -<00:00:38.600> abort

00:00:38.889 --> 00:00:38.899 
um I thought perhaps it was just - abort

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:41.670 
um I thought perhaps it was just - abort
dermatitis<00:00:39.770> I<00:00:40.070> think<00:00:40.370> that's<00:00:40.520> how<00:00:40.610> you<00:00:40.640> say<00:00:40.850> it

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:41.680 
dermatitis I think that's how you say it

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:44.380 
dermatitis I think that's how you say it
annoying<00:00:42.680> me<00:00:42.980> and<00:00:43.160> once<00:00:44.030> again<00:00:44.120> I<00:00:44.239> haven't

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:44.390

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:45.940 
annoying me and once again I haven't
been<00:00:44.570> diagnosed<00:00:45.050> with<00:00:45.110> that<00:00:45.290> yet<00:00:45.500> either<00:00:45.710> at

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:45.950

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:35.770 
went through the rule out of it being
bleached<00:04:33.650> because<00:04:34.130> I<00:04:34.310> bleached<00:04:34.669> my<00:04:34.760> hair<00:04:34.820> but

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:35.780 
bleached because I bleached my hair but

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:39.340 
bleached because I bleached my hair but
I<00:04:35.840> did<00:04:36.320> that<00:04:36.560> three<00:04:37.400> months<00:04:37.639> ago<00:04:37.790> and<00:04:38.350> this

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:39.350 
I did that three months ago and this

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:41.350 
I did that three months ago and this
traumatic<00:04:39.770> loss<00:04:40.070> just<00:04:40.280> happened<00:04:40.700> I<00:04:40.940> do<00:04:41.060> have

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:41.360 
traumatic loss just happened I do have

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:43.510 
traumatic loss just happened I do have
hair<00:04:41.540> girls<00:04:41.780> coming<00:04:42.050> back<00:04:42.200> so<00:04:42.590> I<00:04:42.620> don't<00:04:42.830> think

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:43.520 
hair girls coming back so I don't think

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:45.820 
hair girls coming back so I don't think
it's<00:04:43.790> cancer<00:04:44.080> typically<00:04:45.080> cancer<00:04:45.470> you<00:04:45.680> don't

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:45.830 
it's cancer typically cancer you don't

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:47.740 
it's cancer typically cancer you don't
have<00:04:46.070> the<00:04:46.190> hair<00:04:46.370> coming<00:04:46.610> back<00:04:46.760> um<00:04:47.000> it<00:04:47.630> could

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:47.750 
have the hair coming back um it could

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:51.129 
have the hair coming back um it could
also<00:04:47.930> be<00:04:48.110> alopecia<00:04:49.010> areata<00:04:49.840> but<00:04:50.840> once<00:04:51.020> again

00:04:51.129 --> 00:04:51.139

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:54.710 
and the other cases out there I'm pretty

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:57.159 
and the other cases out there I'm pretty
