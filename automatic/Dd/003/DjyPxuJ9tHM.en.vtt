school<00:00:22.380> the<00:00:22.529> bottom<00:00:22.890> I<00:00:23.039> did<00:00:23.310> that<00:00:23.460> when<00:00:23.609> I<00:00:23.640> was

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760

00:00:25.839 --> 00:00:25.849 
playing around with it on the bottom

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:28.189 
playing around with it on the bottom
because<00:00:26.849> it<00:00:27.119> is<00:00:27.300> close<00:00:27.660> the<00:00:27.810> other<00:00:27.930> one<00:00:28.109> you

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
because it is close the other one you

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.109 
because it is close the other one you
are<00:00:28.410> gonna<00:00:28.650> have<00:00:28.800> this<00:00:28.920> little<00:00:29.130> flappy<00:00:29.640> thing

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
are gonna have this little flappy thing

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.069 
are gonna have this little flappy thing
left<00:00:30.390> so<00:00:31.170> try<00:00:31.740> as<00:00:31.800> hard<00:00:32.160> as<00:00:32.369> you<00:00:32.430> can<00:00:32.820> and<00:00:33.090> you

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
left so try as hard as you can and you

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.840 
left so try as hard as you can and you
can<00:00:34.530> always<00:00:34.980> use<00:00:36.530> tweezers<00:00:37.530> if<00:00:38.129> you<00:00:38.399> find<00:00:38.640> it

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
can always use tweezers if you find it

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:44.240 
can always use tweezers if you find it
hard<00:00:41.120> and<00:00:42.140> basically<00:00:43.140> you<00:00:43.320> can<00:00:43.469> keep<00:00:43.680> pushing

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
hard and basically you can keep pushing

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.569 
hard and basically you can keep pushing
it<00:00:44.340> closer<00:00:44.700> to<00:00:46.010> you<00:00:47.010> can<00:00:47.190> move<00:00:47.370> it<00:00:47.489> around

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
it closer to you can move it around

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:54.459 
it closer to you can move it around
really<00:00:48.239> easy<00:00:50.449> which<00:00:51.449> is<00:00:51.629> not<00:00:51.809> a<00:00:51.840> bad<00:00:51.960> thing

00:00:54.459 --> 00:00:54.469 

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:57.200 

unless<00:00:55.469> you<00:00:55.590> want<00:00:55.800> it<00:00:55.860> to<00:00:56.010> really<00:00:56.460> stay<00:00:56.969> there

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
unless you want it to really stay there

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.709 
unless you want it to really stay there
for<00:00:57.390> a<00:00:57.420> long<00:00:57.660> time<00:00:58.789> yeah<00:00:59.789> so<00:01:00.000> remember<00:01:00.239> to<00:01:00.270> spot

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
for a long time yeah so remember to spot

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.070 
for a long time yeah so remember to spot
what<00:01:01.350> you<00:01:01.440> can<00:01:01.710> do<00:01:02.039> afterwards<00:01:02.730> is<00:01:02.940> to<00:01:03.809> purify

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
what you can do afterwards is to purify

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.490 
what you can do afterwards is to purify
it<00:01:04.439> for<00:01:05.430> it<00:01:05.489> to<00:01:05.610> last<00:01:05.820> a<00:01:06.119> long<00:01:06.270> time<00:01:06.330> you<00:01:07.320> get

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
it for it to last a long time you get

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.670 
it for it to last a long time you get
some<00:01:07.710> spirit<00:01:08.130> gum<00:01:08.310> and<00:01:08.549> you<00:01:09.210> put<00:01:09.479> it<00:01:09.570> over<00:01:09.840> what

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
some spirit gum and you put it over what

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.080 
some spirit gum and you put it over what
you've<00:01:10.830> done<00:01:11.040> already<00:01:13.520> so<00:01:14.520> I<00:01:14.549> did<00:01:14.880> these

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
you've done already so I did these

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.160 
you've done already so I did these
little<00:01:15.450> fake<00:01:15.750> lines<00:01:16.100> faint<00:01:17.100> lines<00:01:17.340> there<00:01:17.670> I

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.170 
little fake lines faint lines there I

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:22.219 
little fake lines faint lines there I
forgot<00:01:19.170> that<00:01:19.470> I<00:01:19.530> done<00:01:19.740> them<00:01:19.920> and<00:01:20.960> you<00:01:21.960> can<00:01:22.110> make

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
forgot that I done them and you can make

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.030 
forgot that I done them and you can make
them<00:01:22.409> better<00:01:22.590> I<00:01:24.140> have<00:01:25.140> a<00:01:25.170> bit<00:01:25.409> more<00:01:25.439> intensive

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
them better I have a bit more intensive

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.330 
them better I have a bit more intensive
intensify<00:01:26.970> them<00:01:27.150> a<00:01:27.180> little<00:01:27.360> bit<00:01:27.600> and<00:01:28.340> do

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
intensify them a little bit and do

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.969 
intensify them a little bit and do
another<00:01:29.460> light<00:01:31.070> layer<00:01:32.070> over<00:01:32.369> the<00:01:32.549> top<00:01:32.790> just<00:01:33.979> a

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
another light layer over the top just a

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.649 
another light layer over the top just a
little<00:01:35.280> light<00:01:35.460> layer<00:01:35.700> doesn't<00:01:36.270> need<00:01:36.479> to<00:01:36.570> be

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
little light layer doesn't need to be

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:42.160 
little light layer doesn't need to be
heaps

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:42.170 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:53.880 

my<00:01:43.170> nest<00:01:43.350> mates<00:01:43.560> turn<00:01:43.829> part<00:01:44.159> 1<00:01:44.340> part<00:01:44.610> 2<00:01:44.670> video

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:53.890 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:56.790 

so<00:01:54.820> I've<00:01:54.909> got<00:01:55.150> my<00:01:55.180> last<00:01:55.690> one<00:01:56.080> see<00:01:56.409> I've<00:01:56.530> got<00:01:56.770> a

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:56.800 
so I've got my last one see I've got a

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.780 
so I've got my last one see I've got a
that<00:01:57.460> that<00:01:57.820> and<00:01:57.940> I<00:01:57.970> need<00:01:58.150> another<00:01:58.390> one<00:01:58.600> there

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
that that and I need another one there

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.160 
that that and I need another one there
so<00:02:00.790> again<00:02:01.240> you're<00:02:01.450> just<00:02:01.570> going<00:02:01.720> to<00:02:01.780> pinch<00:02:02.080> the

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.170 
so again you're just going to pinch the

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.700 
so again you're just going to pinch the
sides<00:02:02.680> of<00:02:02.979> it<00:02:03.930> so<00:02:04.930> that's<00:02:04.990> what<00:02:05.229> happens<00:02:05.530> when

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:05.710 
sides of it so that's what happens when

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:09.930 
sides of it so that's what happens when
I<00:02:06.010> pinched<00:02:06.460> it<00:02:07.619> it<00:02:08.619> still<00:02:08.979> got<00:02:09.220> the<00:02:09.340> bit<00:02:09.759> in<00:02:09.880> the

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 
I pinched it it still got the bit in the

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:11.910 
I pinched it it still got the bit in the
middle<00:02:10.090> but<00:02:10.330> I'm<00:02:10.479> just<00:02:10.630> pinching<00:02:11.200> this<00:02:11.380> the

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
middle but I'm just pinching this the

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.810 
middle but I'm just pinching this the
edges<00:02:12.430> of<00:02:12.610> my<00:02:12.670> little<00:02:13.150> bulb<00:02:13.950> shape<00:02:14.950> cycle

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:15.820 
edges of my little bulb shape cycle

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:19.860 
edges of my little bulb shape cycle
thing<00:02:16.360> looks<00:02:16.810> like<00:02:16.870> a<00:02:16.959> pimple<00:02:17.320> basically<00:02:18.870> but

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
thing looks like a pimple basically but

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:21.510 
thing looks like a pimple basically but
you<00:02:19.989> kind<00:02:20.200> of<00:02:20.320> do<00:02:20.530> you<00:02:20.739> kind<00:02:21.040> of<00:02:21.130> want<00:02:21.340> it<00:02:21.400> to

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:21.520 
you kind of do you kind of want it to

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:22.800 
you kind of do you kind of want it to
look<00:02:21.640> like<00:02:21.700> a<00:02:21.850> pimple<00:02:22.270> because<00:02:22.540> it<00:02:22.660> looks

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
look like a pimple because it looks

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:26.660 
look like a pimple because it looks
pretty<00:02:22.959> cool<00:02:23.140> like<00:02:23.470> that<00:02:23.500> um<00:02:24.040> I<00:02:24.610> don't<00:02:25.180> know<00:02:25.480> I

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
pretty cool like that um I don't know I

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:31.140 
pretty cool like that um I don't know I
call<00:02:27.670> it<00:02:27.790> my<00:02:27.820> little<00:02:27.940> pimple<00:02:29.790> can<00:02:30.790> always<00:02:30.970> use

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
call it my little pimple can always use

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.690 
call it my little pimple can always use
it<00:02:31.300> as<00:02:31.390> a<00:02:31.420> pimple<00:02:31.840> if<00:02:31.930> you<00:02:32.050> really<00:02:32.800> want<00:02:33.040> don't

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
it as a pimple if you really want don't

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.150 
it as a pimple if you really want don't
really<00:02:33.820> matter<00:02:34.140> yeah<00:02:35.140> I<00:02:35.170> find<00:02:35.560> that<00:02:35.739> if<00:02:35.950> you

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
really matter yeah I find that if you

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.400 
really matter yeah I find that if you
aren't<00:02:36.610> pinch<00:02:36.850> it<00:02:37.060> first<00:02:37.480> and<00:02:37.900> then<00:02:38.019> apply<00:02:38.350> it

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410 
aren't pinch it first and then apply it

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:45.479 
aren't pinch it first and then apply it
it's<00:02:38.739> so<00:02:39.700> much<00:02:39.760> easier<00:02:40.510> to<00:02:42.690> push<00:02:43.690> down<00:02:43.720> on<00:02:44.489> your

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:45.489 
it's so much easier to push down on your

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:52.800 
it's so much easier to push down on your
face<00:02:49.620> and<00:02:50.620> smooth<00:02:51.580> it<00:02:51.760> into<00:02:52.030> your<00:02:52.090> face<00:02:52.330> I<00:02:52.570> just

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
face and smooth it into your face I just

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480 
when I smile like I like that that's got

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:25.560 
when I smile like I like that that's got
a<00:03:22.510> line<00:03:22.780> on<00:03:22.810> it<00:03:23.019> so<00:03:24.010> it's<00:03:24.180> pushed<00:03:25.180> it<00:03:25.450> a<00:03:25.540> bit

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:25.570 
a line on it so it's pushed it a bit

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:48.240 
a line on it so it's pushed it a bit

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:53.360 
so by doing the little lines you don't
have<00:03:50.860> a<00:03:50.890> perfect<00:03:51.670> line<00:03:51.940> like<00:03:52.240> these<00:03:52.420> ones<00:03:52.660> here
