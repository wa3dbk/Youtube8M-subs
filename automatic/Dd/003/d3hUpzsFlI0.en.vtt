 Here the top 5 fastest I Skiles 

00:00:31.989 --> 00:00:35.470
 I was thinking about finishing this series

 only you are enjoying it a lot 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:41.740
 type in the last video people got two 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:43.660
 a thousand and a few websites almost 2,500 then I 

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:46.810
 I'm going to continue the series and you're 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:49.150
 sending several epic games there in the 

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:51.640
 My email is hard for damn good people. 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:54.040
 because for example I saw some 300 emails 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:57.460
 to choose five matches 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:01:00.100
 It's very difficult, but it's okay. 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:02.260
 How are you, people? What's up? 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:04.059

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:08.799
 episodes only bug here because it will be 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:11.259
 A little tricky even to make 

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:13.659
 have to fetch all the videos of the year and 

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:15.580
 and I had trouble downloading the 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:17.500
 videos so I 'm here for a couple of hours 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:19.260
 and it all but exists that the video was 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:22.510
 complicated now for you to have a notion 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:25.390
 but that's it, I hope you like it 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:28.360

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:39.460
 the fifth placed 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:42.130
 Then he began to pick up his body from the chest. 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:44.500
 I already went next to the opponent's island. 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.630
 that the guy did not even see and livin and 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:49.240
 type almost no one think even the rhythm 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:52.060
 and took 26 thousand there he had enough 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:53.710
 soup in the inventory and touched ginger he 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.140
 he already has a guy making a bridge there 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:59.260
 to get the clay attacked the snow lard 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:01.540
 - two faces there less than 40 seconds 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:03.310
 there he started to make the bridge 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:05.950
 to go to this guy he was inside 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.299
 of the beautiful cube cave and stood with 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:12.340
 daily sword that helped me a lot 

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:16.450
 He managed to kill the guy now and 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:19.599
 tava turning what was this guy there and 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:21.310
 It was there and jumped on the island and ready to 

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:24.340
 dude it was a very match 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:26.290
 but it was not such an epoch that neither the 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:30.340
 next so that's why we 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:32.349
 left here as fifth placed beauty 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.870

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:59.479
 His face with an arrow is when he 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:02.000
 He saw that he kind takes his attention he 

00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:04.099
 It was there for him and there was a guy coming 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.400

 already killed a guy right from the start the guy 

00:06:15.469 --> 00:06:21.620
 but you'll see what he's going to do 

00:06:17.509 --> 00:06:24.380
 just with an expensive wooden ax 

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:26.389
 You did not see the beauty and started to 

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:30.319
