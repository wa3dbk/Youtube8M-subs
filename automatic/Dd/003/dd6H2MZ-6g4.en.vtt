00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.349 
spot so let's see if this actually
covers<00:00:22.800> so<00:00:23.279> what<00:00:23.430> it<00:00:23.519> does<00:00:23.670> is<00:00:23.820> you<00:00:23.970> shake<00:00:24.330> it

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359

up and remember air foams typically have

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.990 
up and remember air foams typically have
alcohol<00:00:27.689> in<00:00:28.050> them<00:00:28.289> so<00:00:28.859> it<00:00:29.039> might<00:00:29.279> be<00:00:29.429> a<00:00:29.460> tad<00:00:29.849> bit

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
alcohol in them so it might be a tad bit

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.799 
alcohol in them so it might be a tad bit
drying<00:00:30.330> and<00:00:30.660> it<00:00:31.109> pops<00:00:31.320> out<00:00:31.529> just<00:00:31.800> like<00:00:31.980> that

00:00:32.799 --> 00:00:32.809 
drying and it pops out just like that

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:36.170 
drying and it pops out just like that
just<00:00:33.809> like<00:00:33.930> a<00:00:34.050> a<00:00:34.410> mousse<00:00:35.010> this<00:00:35.880> is<00:00:36.059> the

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
just like a a mousse this is the

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.990 
just like a a mousse this is the
consistency<00:00:36.809> so<00:00:37.230> it<00:00:37.320> kind<00:00:37.500> of<00:00:37.530> just<00:00:38.000> bubbles

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
consistency so it kind of just bubbles

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.610
