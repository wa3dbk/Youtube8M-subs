00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.770
 Yes 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:45.670
 Yes 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:16.620
 We are relative in the first half 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.120
 good until the 16th still played 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.010
 then of course have the 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.510
 let miss on 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.740
 see on the last meters of the 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.240
 we do not have it in the last zone 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:25.740
 managed to get behind the defense 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:27.450
 that is very many 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:30.570
 attack for heidfeld will test in this 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.980
 instant and atlas comes naturally 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:33.720
 by the standard to the 10 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.250
 Of course you can do that well over almost 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.410
 the best team actually in the 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:39.390
 league with very good header players 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:41.070
 have had to do that very well 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.360
 the second half because of that 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:44.340
 also has a bit open 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.840
 this of course gives space for 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:48.960
 Atlas she also used very well 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:51.060
 and nevertheless we are us 

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:52.140
 are table leaders still and me 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.490
 just have that to my boys 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:57.140
 I am quite sure that we as 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:57.140
 Master will go upstairs 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:05.330
 of course too much 

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:07.490
 I think it was a deserved victory 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:09.430
 team has implemented the plan well 

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:11.360
 compliment to the team 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:14.300
 the key was sure that we 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:16.790
 defensively well we confessed that 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:18.440
 the offensive forces of Ganderkesee 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:20.270
 have taken the game thomas motor 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:22.370
 very good against the Czech Republic on the 

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:25.430
 On the other side of the klik niklas 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:26.930
 Baumeister went on ramge later on Dietrich 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:28.430
 came across not so much outside that 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:29.750
 ganderkesee actually always forced 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:32.360
 was the long ball on carino 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:35.900
 play or had we air righteousness with 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:37.400
 flo knipping and also philipp stephan like that 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:40.580
 that ganderkesee not played out either 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:41.750
 could develop a lot and we wanted 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:43.250
 fast forward play fast 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:44.330
 switch to the baller conquest the 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:46.430
 we succeeded too 

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:48.830
 I think that was a deserved victory 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:51.760
 and now have three games against 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:54.440
 Ganderkesee earned three times 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:55.790
 exactly we are still undefeated 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:57.440
 have won the direct duel the 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:00.310
 championship is open again it 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:02.450
 exciting that was our goal 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:04.220
 now we just have to look in the 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:06.410
 final sprint gunderkesee plays a great 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:08.870
 season we also who still have a mistake 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:11.030
 Overall, I have to say both 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:13.880
 Teams play a great season 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:15.470
 and the frame today that speaks well 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:18.820
 both have earned each other for themselves 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:18.820
 That was a great event today
