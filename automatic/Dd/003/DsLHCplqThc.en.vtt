00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:56.600 
pressing the pedal then we'll just learn

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.620 
pressing the pedal then we'll just learn
these<00:00:56.900> pedals<00:00:57.910> for<00:00:58.910> each<00:00:59.030> of<00:00:59.240> the<00:00:59.390> three

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:02.840 
instruments and you'll notice I'm

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.830 
instruments and you'll notice I'm
clicking<00:01:03.110> the<00:01:03.320> the<00:01:03.920> pedal<00:01:04.729> before<00:01:04.910> I<00:01:05.239> select

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:05.840 
clicking the the pedal before I select

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.320 
clicking the the pedal before I select
learn<00:01:06.160> otherwise<00:01:07.160> it<00:01:07.370> learns<00:01:07.610> the<00:01:07.880> previous

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:08.330 
learn otherwise it learns the previous

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.490 
learn otherwise it learns the previous
pedal<00:01:08.750> when<00:01:08.870> it's<00:01:09.050> switching<00:01:09.290> off<00:01:10.630> so<00:01:11.630> just<00:01:12.290> go

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500 
pedal when it's switching off so just go

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.450 
pedal when it's switching off so just go
through<00:01:12.830> that<00:01:13.040> to<00:01:13.640> learned<00:01:14.000> and<00:01:15.310> finally<00:01:16.310> the

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:16.460 
through that to learned and finally the

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.380 
through that to learned and finally the
last<00:01:16.610> one

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:19.390 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:22.649 

there<00:01:20.020> we<00:01:20.140> go<00:01:20.580> and<00:01:21.580> let's<00:01:21.640> see<00:01:22.090> what<00:01:22.210> it<00:01:22.330> can<00:01:22.450> do

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:22.659 
there we go and let's see what it can do

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:51.350 
there we go and let's see what it can do
now

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:02:10.249 

you

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.319 

you
