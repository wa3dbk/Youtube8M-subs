00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:17.430 
others to do it I think it's definitely

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:20.600 
others to do it I think it's definitely
the<00:05:18.210> time<00:05:18.449> component<00:05:18.839> I<00:05:19.229> mean<00:05:19.680> this<00:05:19.800> is<00:05:19.979> a<00:05:20.009> it's

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:20.610 
the time component I mean this is a it's

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:23.510 
the time component I mean this is a it's
a<00:05:20.789> double<00:05:21.719> the<00:05:21.809> work<00:05:22.020> you've<00:05:22.349> got<00:05:22.379> to<00:05:22.620> get<00:05:23.370> your

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:23.520 
a double the work you've got to get your

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:27.730 
a double the work you've got to get your
physique<00:05:23.849> ready<00:05:24.120> dial<00:05:24.719> in<00:05:24.900> cardio<00:05:25.379> and<00:05:25.740> also

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:27.740 
physique ready dial in cardio and also

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:30.320 
physique ready dial in cardio and also
routine<00:05:28.740> that's<00:05:29.069> you<00:05:29.490> know<00:05:29.580> my<00:05:29.789> day<00:05:29.849> of

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:30.330 
routine that's you know my day of

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:31.999 
routine that's you know my day of
stretching<00:05:30.810> and<00:05:30.990> running<00:05:31.349> routine<00:05:31.680> is<00:05:31.860> a

00:05:31.999 --> 00:05:32.009 
stretching and running routine is a

00:05:32.009 --> 00:05:33.769 
stretching and running routine is a
two-hour<00:05:32.580> that's<00:05:32.969> a<00:05:33.120> minimum<00:05:33.360> two-hour

00:05:33.769 --> 00:05:33.779 
two-hour that's a minimum two-hour

00:05:33.779 --> 00:05:36.079 
two-hour that's a minimum two-hour
session<00:05:34.319> so<00:05:34.889> definitely<00:05:35.339> I<00:05:35.400> think<00:05:35.460> time<00:05:35.819> does

00:05:36.079 --> 00:05:36.089 
session so definitely I think time does

00:05:36.089 --> 00:05:37.999 
session so definitely I think time does
have<00:05:36.330> a<00:05:36.360> huge<00:05:37.080> factor<00:05:37.439> to<00:05:37.560> play<00:05:37.740> in<00:05:37.860> it<00:05:37.979> and

00:05:37.999 --> 00:05:38.009 
have a huge factor to play in it and

00:05:38.009 --> 00:05:41.019 
have a huge factor to play in it and
expense<00:05:38.580> the<00:05:38.849> cost<00:05:39.060> of<00:05:39.360> the<00:05:39.930> extra<00:05:40.259> cost<00:05:40.499> of

00:05:41.019 --> 00:05:41.029 
expense the cost of the extra cost of

00:05:41.029 --> 00:05:44.149 
expense the cost of the extra cost of
your<00:05:42.029> choreography<00:05:42.749> and<00:05:43.080> your<00:05:43.349> music<00:05:43.860> your

00:05:44.149 --> 00:05:44.159 
your choreography and your music your

00:05:44.159 --> 00:05:46.279 
your choreography and your music your
