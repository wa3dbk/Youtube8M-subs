00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:52.580 
around the curling wand and then I like

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:54.370 
around the curling wand and then I like
to<00:05:52.729> pull<00:05:53.000> the<00:05:53.030> curl<00:05:53.539> because<00:05:53.750> I<00:05:53.930> feel<00:05:54.110> like<00:05:54.260> it

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:54.380 
to pull the curl because I feel like it

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:56.200 
to pull the curl because I feel like it
helps<00:05:54.949> hold<00:05:55.099> its<00:05:55.310> shape<00:05:55.370> a<00:05:55.669> little<00:05:55.849> bit<00:05:55.970> longer

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:56.210 
helps hold its shape a little bit longer

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:57.909 
helps hold its shape a little bit longer
doing<00:05:56.840> the<00:05:56.930> same<00:05:57.169> thing<00:05:57.440> on<00:05:57.590> the<00:05:57.680> other<00:05:57.710> side

00:05:57.909 --> 00:05:57.919 
doing the same thing on the other side

00:05:57.919 --> 00:06:00.730 
doing the same thing on the other side
very<00:05:58.580> very<00:05:58.789> simple<00:05:59.510> these<00:06:00.050> are<00:06:00.260> titanium

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:00.740 
very very simple these are titanium

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:02.890 
very very simple these are titanium
barrels<00:06:01.550> so<00:06:01.789> it<00:06:01.909> actually<00:06:02.120> makes<00:06:02.510> my<00:06:02.659> hair

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:02.900 
barrels so it actually makes my hair

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:05.439 
barrels so it actually makes my hair
look<00:06:02.930> shinier<00:06:03.770> after<00:06:04.250> using<00:06:04.550> them<00:06:04.880> and<00:06:05.150> here

00:06:05.439 --> 00:06:05.449 
look shinier after using them and here

00:06:05.449 --> 00:06:07.360
