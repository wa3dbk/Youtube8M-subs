00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:11.589
 I bless you all 

00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:13.600
 let's continue with reading 

00:00:11.589 --> 00:00:18.760
 proverbs 

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:20.920
 Chapter 1 and this time from the case 8 to 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:24.240
 19 

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:24.240
 says the word of God 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:30.609
 in the name of the father of the holy spirit 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.950
 Admonitions of wisdom hears son 

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:35.790
 mine the instruction of your father and not 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:38.590
 despises the direction of your mother 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:41.829
 because adornment of grace will be to your 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:44.199
 head and necklaces to your neck my son 

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:48.430
 if sinners who would cheat 

00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:50.379
 do not consent if they digest see with 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:52.100
 we put snares for 

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:55.200
 bloodshed 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:58.380
 so we have no reason to the innocent 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:01.340
 we will treat them alive as the sun and 

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:03.480
 integers like those that fall into an abyss 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:06.740
 we will find riches of all kinds 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:10.170
 we will fill our houses with spoils 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:12.159
 throw your luck between us let's have 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.659
 a whole bag 

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:19.479
 My son, do not walk on the road with them 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:22.420
 put your foot away from their paths because their 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:25.509
 feet run towards evil and go resursos 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:28.920
 to shed blood because in vain 

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:31.560
 generates the network before the eyes of every bird 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.350
 but in their own blood they put those of 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:37.350
 jesting 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:41.250
 already their souls have the bond 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:44.299
 such are the paths of all who are 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:47.930
 given to greed which takes away life 

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:47.930
 of its owners 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.250
 now 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:56.680
 let's meditate a little do a little 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:59.670
 study 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.670
 a little analysis 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.479
 of what God is not talking about 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:10.670
 he says he hears an instruction from 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:13.460
 father and mother 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:15.880
 why a thing like that 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:19.160
 Well, I say that 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:22.940
 If we honor father and mother, 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:25.020
 to our day the earth are going to be 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:28.200
 they are going to start 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:31.050
 it's a great promise 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:34.050
 and the others because who else could not 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:36.080
 give better advice than a father and a 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.080
 mother 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:41.500
 then he tells us that he adorned misfortunes 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:43.340
 they will be at your head and I will hang it to your neck 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:45.800
 why 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:49.060
 because God knows that through life 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:51.849
 of man on earth 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:54.940
 many ups and downs of 

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:57.209
 According to his teaching, this is going to be his 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.209
 walk 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:03.870
 this person has been taught 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:06.540
 duly through a good father and 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:09.390
 of a good mother 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:13.340
 this will save you from many bad 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:13.340
 circumstances that could be 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:19.310
 in which you could have 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:23.799
 involved if on the other hand not 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:23.799
 I would have had a good father and a mother 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:30.890
 here tells us if my son if the 

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:33.170
 sinners who would cheat not 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:35.239
 you consent if they said come with us 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:38.840
 let's put rejects to shed blood 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:41.640
 let's stop them in what are the 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:43.620
 sinners good 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:44.730
 there have always been sinners about the 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:48.510
 earth the fact who is speaking 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:50.549
 sinner the exceptions that 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:53.610
 the one in credits new creature 

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:56.000
 is and we are washed by the blood of 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:56.000
 Christ 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:01.310
 but sinners as sinners do not 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:01.310
 we do not do anything good 

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:08.430
 and we could get along well what could 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:10.469
 take a sinner astray 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:13.709
 and direct let's keep talking more 

00:04:10.469 --> 00:04:17.030
 forward today we have many bad 

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:19.459
 roads many bad trails 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:21.570
 I'm going to advance a little 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:23.570
 we have 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:25.240
 the drug 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:30.039
 of alcohol 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:33.280
 the television the computer are not 

00:04:30.039 --> 00:04:34.990
 bad things are things that have their 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:38.700
 good part 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:41.000
 but it also brings bad bad trails 

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:43.520
 bad roads 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:47.110
 then we are still talking in fact 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:47.110
 thank you very much I bless you
