00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
want to make sure that your controller

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.459 
want to make sure that your controller
is<00:00:44.190> not<00:00:44.430> turned<00:00:44.789> on<00:00:44.969> before<00:00:45.899> you<00:00:45.989> turn<00:00:46.170> on<00:00:46.320> the

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:15.240 

okay<00:03:14.050> it<00:03:14.110> looks<00:03:14.260> like<00:03:14.410> I'm<00:03:14.530> gonna<00:03:14.680> have<00:03:14.770> to

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 
okay it looks like I'm gonna have to

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:17.760 
okay it looks like I'm gonna have to
allow<00:03:15.940> this<00:03:16.240> again<00:03:16.630> so<00:03:17.140> that<00:03:17.260> I<00:03:17.350> can<00:03:17.500> get<00:03:17.650> my

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:17.770 
allow this again so that I can get my

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:21.150 
allow this again so that I can get my
camera<00:03:17.830> working<00:03:19.500> one<00:03:20.500> of<00:03:20.590> the<00:03:20.650> things<00:03:20.860> I<00:03:20.980> get

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.160 
camera working one of the things I get

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.340 
camera working one of the things I get
to<00:03:21.190> do<00:03:21.430> again<00:03:21.730> now<00:03:22.090> that<00:03:22.330> I've<00:03:22.540> installed<00:03:22.810> the

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:23.350 
to do again now that I've installed the

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:26.960 
to do again now that I've installed the
software<00:03:23.980> is<00:03:24.630> recalibrate<00:03:25.630> the<00:03:25.780> compass<00:03:26.230> so

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
software is recalibrate the compass so

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:30.540 
software is recalibrate the compass so
I'm<00:03:27.970> going<00:03:28.330> to<00:03:28.480> go<00:03:28.660> ahead<00:03:28.750> and<00:03:28.990> do<00:03:29.140> this<00:03:29.550> be

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:30.550 
I'm going to go ahead and do this be

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:33.510 
I'm going to go ahead and do this be
sure<00:03:30.790> I've<00:03:31.750> put<00:03:32.320> the<00:03:32.500> aircraft<00:03:32.680> over<00:03:33.250> there

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:33.520 
sure I've put the aircraft over there

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:36.870 
sure I've put the aircraft over there
and<00:03:34.090> I'm<00:03:34.180> gonna<00:03:34.590> make<00:03:35.590> sure<00:03:35.650> no<00:03:36.100> metal<00:03:36.400> objects

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:36.880 
and I'm gonna make sure no metal objects

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:39.840 
and I'm gonna make sure no metal objects
the<00:03:37.480> Apple<00:03:37.870> watch<00:03:38.050> I<00:03:38.290> are<00:03:39.130> probably<00:03:39.520> any

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:39.850 
the Apple watch I are probably any

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:44.270 
the Apple watch I are probably any
SmartWatch<00:03:40.450> has<00:03:40.780> enough<00:03:41.080> RF<00:03:41.530> interference<00:03:41.970> to

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
SmartWatch has enough RF interference to

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.050 
SmartWatch has enough RF interference to
confuse<00:03:45.280> the<00:03:45.430> compass<00:03:45.760> when<00:03:45.940> you're

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.060 
confuse the compass when you're

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:47.400 
confuse the compass when you're
calibrating<00:03:46.660> it<00:03:46.720> so<00:03:46.959> if<00:03:47.080> you<00:03:47.230> have<00:03:47.380> a

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:47.410 
calibrating it so if you have a

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:48.960 
calibrating it so if you have a
SmartWatch<00:03:48.040> you<00:03:48.280> want<00:03:48.459> to<00:03:48.520> take<00:03:48.700> it<00:03:48.820> off

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:48.970 
SmartWatch you want to take it off

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:54.930 
SmartWatch you want to take it off
before<00:03:49.209> you<00:03:49.540> calibrate<00:03:50.050> the<00:03:50.170> compass<00:03:53.940> I'll

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:54.940 
before you calibrate the compass I'll

00:03:54.940 --> 00:04:20.590 
before you calibrate the compass I'll
start<00:03:55.270> up<00:03:55.360> the<00:03:55.390> camera

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:20.600 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:22.660
