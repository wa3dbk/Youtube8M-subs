00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
detracts from a game because people will

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.369 
detracts from a game because people will
just<00:00:53.039> shoot<00:00:53.219> at<00:00:53.430> the<00:00:53.670> triangle<00:00:53.969> and<00:00:54.449> even<00:00:55.230> if

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
just shoot at the triangle and even if

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.680

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
though that person is behind a bush or

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.569 
though that person is behind a bush or
behind<00:00:57.930> a<00:00:58.079> wall<00:00:58.289> and<00:00:58.590> you<00:00:58.920> can't<00:00:59.129> actually<00:00:59.280> see

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
behind a wall and you can't actually see

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.010 
behind a wall and you can't actually see
them<00:00:59.730> they'll<00:01:00.120> still<00:01:00.329> shoot<00:01:00.539> at<00:01:00.660> them<00:01:00.809> in

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
them they'll still shoot at them in

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.020 
them they'll still shoot at them in
hopes<00:01:01.289> that<00:01:01.379> they'll<00:01:01.559> get<00:01:01.649> the<00:01:01.770> kill<00:01:01.949> so<00:01:02.910> what

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
hopes that they'll get the kill so what

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.490 
hopes that they'll get the kill so what
they're<00:01:03.149> doing<00:01:03.390> here<00:01:03.660> instead<00:01:03.870> is<00:01:04.170> that

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
they're doing here instead is that

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.149 
they're doing here instead is that
they're<00:01:04.619> still<00:01:04.799> gonna<00:01:04.949> be<00:01:05.040> 3d<00:01:05.400> spotting<00:01:05.640> and

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:07.159 
they're still gonna be 3d spotting and

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:09.170 
they're still gonna be 3d spotting and
also<00:01:08.159> 2d<00:01:08.400> spotting<00:01:08.700> so<00:01:08.790> you're<00:01:08.909> gonna<00:01:09.030> see

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
also 2d spotting so you're gonna see

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.880 
also 2d spotting so you're gonna see
them<00:01:09.270> on<00:01:09.330> your<00:01:09.450> mini-map<00:01:09.780> but<00:01:10.409> if<00:01:10.650> that<00:01:10.830> person

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
them on your mini-map but if that person

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.660 
them on your mini-map but if that person
goes<00:01:11.430> behind<00:01:12.049> cover<00:01:13.049> and<00:01:13.290> you<00:01:14.040> no<00:01:14.250> longer<00:01:14.400> have

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
goes behind cover and you no longer have

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.249 
goes behind cover and you no longer have
line<00:01:14.820> of<00:01:14.850> sight<00:01:14.939> on<00:01:15.119> them<00:01:15.390> they<00:01:15.720> are<00:01:15.900> no<00:01:16.020> longer

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
line of sight on them they are no longer

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.010 
line of sight on them they are no longer
going<00:01:16.500> to<00:01:16.619> actually<00:01:17.369> have<00:01:18.119> that<00:01:18.270> red<00:01:18.540> triangle

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
going to actually have that red triangle

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.030 
going to actually have that red triangle
over<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:19.200> head<00:01:19.320> they'll<00:01:19.500> still<00:01:19.799> be<00:01:19.920> on<00:01:20.009> your

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
over the head they'll still be on your

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.469 
over the head they'll still be on your
mini-map<00:01:20.460> so<00:01:20.640> you'll<00:01:20.729> still<00:01:20.939> have<00:01:21.030> a<00:01:21.090> general

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
mini-map so you'll still have a general

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.090 
mini-map so you'll still have a general
idea<00:01:21.600> of<00:01:21.750> where<00:01:21.930> they're<00:01:22.049> at<00:01:22.229> but<00:01:22.830> they<00:01:22.950> will

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
idea of where they're at but they will

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.539 
idea of where they're at but they will
not<00:01:23.250> have<00:01:23.310> the<00:01:24.290> 3d<00:01:25.290> spotting<00:01:25.500> so<00:01:25.950> that<00:01:26.400> was

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
not have the 3d spotting so that was

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:27.770 
not have the 3d spotting so that was
their<00:01:26.670> solution<00:01:27.090> I<00:01:27.180> think<00:01:27.210> it's<00:01:27.450> a<00:01:27.509> good<00:01:27.659> one

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
their solution I think it's a good one

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.420 
their solution I think it's a good one
nice<00:01:28.080> and<00:01:28.439> I'm<00:01:28.590> kind<00:01:28.890> of<00:01:28.920> interested<00:01:29.040> to<00:01:29.250> see

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
nice and I'm kind of interested to see

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:30.679 
nice and I'm kind of interested to see
how<00:01:29.640> it's<00:01:29.850> actually<00:01:29.939> going<00:01:30.210> to<00:01:30.299> work<00:01:30.420> with

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
how it's actually going to work with

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.870 
how it's actually going to work with
line<00:01:30.840> of<00:01:30.960> sight<00:01:31.220> but<00:01:32.220> I<00:01:32.400> think<00:01:32.579> it's<00:01:32.670> gonna<00:01:32.759> be

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
line of sight but I think it's gonna be

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.840 
line of sight but I think it's gonna be
good<00:01:33.259> so<00:01:34.259> up<00:01:34.439> next<00:01:34.799> a<00:01:34.950> lot<00:01:35.130> of<00:01:35.280> people<00:01:35.520> really

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
good so up next a lot of people really

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.780 
good so up next a lot of people really
wanted<00:01:36.150> to<00:01:36.240> have<00:01:36.420> 6<00:01:36.780> man<00:01:36.990> squads<00:01:37.380> and<00:01:37.680> dice<00:01:38.490> is

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
wanted to have 6 man squads and dice is

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.789 
wanted to have 6 man squads and dice is
sticking<00:01:39.180> with<00:01:39.210> only<00:01:39.720> 4<00:01:40.140> man<00:01:40.290> squads<00:01:40.590> from

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
sticking with only 4 man squads from

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.889 
sticking with only 4 man squads from
battlefield<00:01:41.189> 3<00:01:41.299> there<00:01:42.299> were<00:01:42.479> 6<00:01:42.750> in

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
battlefield 3 there were 6 in

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.060 
battlefield 3 there were 6 in
battlefield<00:01:43.259> 2<00:01:43.409> so<00:01:43.560> that's<00:01:43.710> why<00:01:43.860> a<00:01:43.890> lot<00:01:44.040> of

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
battlefield 2 so that's why a lot of

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.429 
battlefield 2 so that's why a lot of
people<00:01:44.159> were<00:01:45.030> wanting<00:01:45.930> to<00:01:46.110> have<00:01:46.290> that

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
people were wanting to have that

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.920 
people were wanting to have that
implemented<00:01:46.979> and<00:01:47.420> they<00:01:48.420> also<00:01:48.570> one<00:01:48.810> of<00:01:48.840> the

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
implemented and they also one of the

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.450 
implemented and they also one of the
common<00:01:49.229> rows<00:01:49.380> or<00:01:49.560> the<00:01:49.590> command<00:01:49.920> Rose<00:01:50.159> I<00:01:50.310> think

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
common rows or the command Rose I think

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.340 
common rows or the command Rose I think
that's<00:01:50.610> what's<00:01:50.729> called<00:01:50.939> in<00:01:51.720> battlefield<00:01:52.200> 3

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
that's what's called in battlefield 3

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:53.929 
that's what's called in battlefield 3
for<00:01:52.380> PC<00:01:52.829> and<00:01:53.009> they<00:01:53.159> actually<00:01:53.310> did<00:01:53.610> get<00:01:53.790> that

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
for PC and they actually did get that

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.429 
for PC and they actually did get that
request<00:01:54.360> so<00:01:54.689> there<00:01:54.869> is<00:01:55.020> going<00:01:55.200> to<00:01:55.259> be<00:01:55.350> the

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
request so there is going to be the

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.830 
request so there is going to be the
commander<00:01:55.740> Rose<00:01:55.920> in<00:01:56.189> battlefield<00:01:57.180> 3<00:01:57.420> but

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
commander Rose in battlefield 3 but

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.420 
commander Rose in battlefield 3 but
they're<00:01:58.020> not<00:01:58.229> going<00:01:58.500> to<00:01:58.619> actually<00:01:58.829> have<00:01:59.189> the

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
they're not going to actually have the

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:00.950 
they're not going to actually have the
six<00:01:59.640> man<00:01:59.790> squad<00:02:00.090> so<00:02:00.240> it's<00:02:00.360> only<00:02:00.450> gonna<00:02:00.600> be<00:02:00.689> 4

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
six man squad so it's only gonna be 4

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.990 
six man squad so it's only gonna be 4
man<00:02:01.110> squads<00:02:01.439> but<00:02:02.040> they<00:02:02.159> have<00:02:02.369> made<00:02:02.610> a<00:02:02.640> change

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
man squads but they have made a change

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.929 
man squads but they have made a change
aware<00:02:03.930> I<00:02:04.469> believe<00:02:04.920> all<00:02:05.189> you<00:02:05.460> could<00:02:05.729> only

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
aware I believe all you could only

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:08.419 
aware I believe all you could only
actually<00:02:06.360> spawn<00:02:06.689> on<00:02:06.960> your<00:02:07.229> your<00:02:07.860> squad<00:02:08.190> leader

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
actually spawn on your your squad leader

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.910 
actually spawn on your your squad leader
and<00:02:08.640> they've<00:02:09.569> reverted<00:02:10.080> back<00:02:10.200> to<00:02:10.379> actually

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
and they've reverted back to actually

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.290 
and they've reverted back to actually
Battlefield<00:02:11.310> Bad<00:02:11.340> Company<00:02:11.459> 2<00:02:11.730> where<00:02:12.090> you<00:02:12.180> can

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
Battlefield Bad Company 2 where you can

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.770 
Battlefield Bad Company 2 where you can
actually<00:02:12.569> spawn<00:02:12.810> on<00:02:12.989> anyone<00:02:13.410> on

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
actually spawn on anyone on

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.320 
actually spawn on anyone on
your<00:02:13.870> team<00:02:14.080> so<00:02:14.520> if<00:02:15.520> your<00:02:15.819> squad<00:02:16.060> leader<00:02:16.090> is

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
your team so if your squad leader is

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:17.580 
your team so if your squad leader is
dead<00:02:16.600> you're<00:02:16.930> still<00:02:17.140> gonna<00:02:17.230> have<00:02:17.319> that<00:02:17.470> option

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
dead you're still gonna have that option

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:19.530 
dead you're still gonna have that option
to<00:02:17.830> actually<00:02:18.220> be<00:02:18.700> up<00:02:18.880> in<00:02:19.060> the<00:02:19.180> front<00:02:19.300> lines

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
to actually be up in the front lines

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.240 
to actually be up in the front lines
again<00:02:19.870> and<00:02:20.080> not<00:02:20.380> have<00:02:20.440> to<00:02:20.650> be<00:02:20.770> run<00:02:20.980> all<00:02:21.160> the<00:02:21.220> way

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
again and not have to be run all the way

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.010 
again and not have to be run all the way
back<00:02:21.520> from<00:02:22.000> your<00:02:22.270> spawn<00:02:22.480> points<00:02:22.810> so<00:02:22.870> I<00:02:22.900> think

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:23.020 
back from your spawn points so I think

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:25.050 
back from your spawn points so I think
this<00:02:23.200> is<00:02:23.319> a<00:02:23.350> good<00:02:23.530> change<00:02:23.740> I<00:02:24.069> would<00:02:24.850> imagine

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
this is a good change I would imagine

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:26.520 
this is a good change I would imagine
that<00:02:25.300> it<00:02:25.480> would<00:02:25.569> get<00:02:25.660> really<00:02:25.780> frustrating<00:02:26.440> if

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
that it would get really frustrating if

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:27.990 
that it would get really frustrating if
you<00:02:26.620> had<00:02:26.770> a<00:02:26.800> squad<00:02:27.100> leader<00:02:27.130> that<00:02:27.520> just<00:02:27.700> had<00:02:27.819> no

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
you had a squad leader that just had no

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.880 
you had a squad leader that just had no
idea<00:02:28.030> what<00:02:28.360> he<00:02:28.420> was<00:02:28.450> doing<00:02:28.900> and<00:02:29.020> he<00:02:29.410> would<00:02:29.709> she

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
idea what he was doing and he would she

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:31.410 
idea what he was doing and he would she
would<00:02:29.980> just<00:02:30.130> you<00:02:30.220> know<00:02:30.250> die<00:02:30.489> constantly<00:02:31.120> and

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
would just you know die constantly and

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:32.760 
would just you know die constantly and
he<00:02:31.450> wouldn't<00:02:31.810> actually<00:02:31.930> big-play<00:02:32.350> that<00:02:32.590> kind

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:32.770 
he wouldn't actually big-play that kind

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:34.260 
he wouldn't actually big-play that kind
of<00:02:32.860> mobile<00:02:33.040> spawn<00:02:33.430> sit<00:02:33.730> back<00:02:33.910> a<00:02:33.940> little<00:02:34.030> bit

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:34.270 
of mobile spawn sit back a little bit

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:37.800 
of mobile spawn sit back a little bit
and<00:02:34.590> more<00:02:35.590> be<00:02:35.770> a<00:02:35.800> more<00:02:36.010> passive<00:02:36.220> player<00:02:36.670> I<00:02:37.420> feel

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
and more be a more passive player I feel

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:38.970 
and more be a more passive player I feel
like<00:02:37.930> that<00:02:38.020> would<00:02:38.170> get<00:02:38.290> a<00:02:38.350> little<00:02:38.560> frustrating

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
like that would get a little frustrating

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:40.320 
like that would get a little frustrating
so<00:02:39.069> I'm<00:02:39.160> glad<00:02:39.280> to<00:02:39.459> see<00:02:39.610> that<00:02:39.730> they<00:02:39.880> are<00:02:39.910> just

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 
so I'm glad to see that they are just

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.390 
so I'm glad to see that they are just
reverting<00:02:41.020> back<00:02:41.050> to<00:02:41.200> that<00:02:41.380> being<00:02:42.160> able<00:02:42.250> to

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
reverting back to that being able to

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:43.530 
reverting back to that being able to
spawn<00:02:42.640> at<00:02:42.730> anyone<00:02:43.000> I<00:02:43.030> think<00:02:43.209> that's<00:02:43.330> a<00:02:43.390> good

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
spawn at anyone I think that's a good

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:45.030 
spawn at anyone I think that's a good
change<00:02:43.750> and<00:02:44.080> I<00:02:44.260> think<00:02:44.440> most<00:02:44.590> people<00:02:44.709> are<00:02:44.890> going

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
change and I think most people are going

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.130 
change and I think most people are going
to<00:02:45.220> appreciate<00:02:45.489> it<00:02:45.780> when<00:02:46.780> the<00:02:46.870> game<00:02:47.019> is

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 
to appreciate it when the game is

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:49.880 
to appreciate it when the game is
actually<00:02:47.290> released<00:02:48.090> another<00:02:49.090> thing<00:02:49.420> is<00:02:49.630> that

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
actually released another thing is that

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.380 
actually released another thing is that
I've<00:02:50.890> mentioned<00:02:51.340> this<00:02:51.400> before<00:02:51.459> but<00:02:51.910> the<00:02:52.030> EOD

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
I've mentioned this before but the EOD

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:54.420 
I've mentioned this before but the EOD
bot<00:02:52.600> they<00:02:52.989> haven't<00:02:53.260> mentioned<00:02:53.590> much<00:02:53.769> but<00:02:54.310> they

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
bot they haven't mentioned much but they

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:55.949 
bot they haven't mentioned much but they

players who you know really invest in
trying<00:03:37.720> to<00:03:37.870> master<00:03:38.320> the<00:03:39.070> air<00:03:39.220> vehicles<00:03:39.730> so<00:03:39.940> a

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 
trying to master the air vehicles so a

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:41.729 
trying to master the air vehicles so a
newer<00:03:40.540> player<00:03:40.720> is<00:03:40.989> going<00:03:41.200> to<00:03:41.320> be<00:03:41.410> able<00:03:41.470> to<00:03:41.620> fly

around<00:03:41.829> the<00:03:41.980> new<00:03:42.100> jet<00:03:42.310> they<00:03:42.459> may<00:03:42.609> not<00:03:42.820> do<00:03:42.970> very

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
around the new jet they may not do very

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:44.699 
around the new jet they may not do very
well<00:03:43.269> and<00:03:43.600> there's<00:03:44.019> really<00:03:44.200> going<00:03:44.410> to<00:03:44.590> be<00:03:44.680> a

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:44.709 
well and there's really going to be a

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:46.259 
well and there's really going to be a
difference<00:03:45.010> between<00:03:45.070> a<00:03:45.370> new<00:03:45.700> player<00:03:45.970> playing

00:03:46.259 --> 00:03:46.269 
difference between a new player playing

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:47.729 
difference between a new player playing
on<00:03:46.420> the<00:03:46.480> jet<00:03:46.690> and<00:03:46.870> one<00:03:47.350> of<00:03:47.440> those<00:03:47.500> players

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:47.739 
on the jet and one of those players

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:49.410 
on the jet and one of those players
that's<00:03:47.980> played<00:03:48.160> you<00:03:48.250> know<00:03:48.370> our<00:03:48.790> ridiculous

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:49.420 
that's played you know our ridiculous

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:51.030 
that's played you know our ridiculous
amount<00:03:49.630> of<00:03:49.690> hours<00:03:49.930> trying<00:03:50.200> to<00:03:50.230> master<00:03:50.560> it<00:03:50.680> so<00:03:50.859> I

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.040 
amount of hours trying to master it so I

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:52.349 
amount of hours trying to master it so I
think<00:03:51.340> that's<00:03:51.549> good

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:52.359 
think that's good

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:53.699 
think that's good
they've<00:03:52.660> also<00:03:52.930> mentioned<00:03:53.290> that<00:03:53.350> they<00:03:53.500> don't

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:53.709 
they've also mentioned that they don't

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:55.530 
they've also mentioned that they don't
want<00:03:53.920> the<00:03:54.070> players<00:03:54.310> that<00:03:54.579> are<00:03:54.640> you<00:03:55.209> know<00:03:55.329> they

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:55.540 
want the players that are you know they

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:56.970 
want the players that are you know they
put<00:03:55.840> a<00:03:55.900> lot<00:03:55.989> of<00:03:56.109> time<00:03:56.260> into<00:03:56.410> it<00:03:56.500> to<00:03:56.709> just<00:03:56.890> be

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:56.980 
put a lot of time into it to just be

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:58.800 
put a lot of time into it to just be
completely<00:03:57.459> overpowered<00:03:58.000> so<00:03:58.150> they<00:03:58.510> are<00:03:58.630> gonna

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:58.810 
completely overpowered so they are gonna

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:00.240 
completely overpowered so they are gonna
make<00:03:58.900> it<00:03:59.079> so<00:03:59.350> that<00:03:59.380> Jets<00:03:59.709> can't<00:03:59.980> just<00:04:00.130> be

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:00.250 
make it so that Jets can't just be

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:02.460 
make it so that Jets can't just be
ridiculous<00:04:00.850> but<00:04:01.420> they're<00:04:01.600> also<00:04:01.840> going<00:04:02.260> to<00:04:02.350> be

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:02.470 
ridiculous but they're also going to be

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:04.050 
ridiculous but they're also going to be
able<00:04:02.560> and<00:04:02.769> allowed<00:04:03.070> to<00:04:03.400> actually<00:04:03.820> use<00:04:03.940> the

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:04.060 
able and allowed to actually use the

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:05.880 
able and allowed to actually use the
physics<00:04:04.359> of<00:04:04.450> the<00:04:04.540> engine<00:04:04.870> to<00:04:04.989> pull<00:04:05.560> off<00:04:05.680> some

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:05.890 
physics of the engine to pull off some

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:08.340 
physics of the engine to pull off some
pretty<00:04:06.160> crazy<00:04:06.459> stunts<00:04:06.940> and<00:04:07.209> do<00:04:08.019> a<00:04:08.049> lot<00:04:08.260> of

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:08.350 
pretty crazy stunts and do a lot of

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:09.420 
pretty crazy stunts and do a lot of
crazy<00:04:08.560> stuff<00:04:08.650> with<00:04:08.890> it<00:04:09.010> so<00:04:09.130> I<00:04:09.160> think<00:04:09.280> that's

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:09.430 
crazy stuff with it so I think that's

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:11.370 
crazy stuff with it so I think that's
really<00:04:09.820> cool<00:04:10.090> I'm<00:04:10.359> glad<00:04:10.720> to<00:04:10.900> see<00:04:11.079> that<00:04:11.109> there

so<00:04:21.489> speaking<00:04:21.909> of<00:04:22.120> air<00:04:22.510> vehicles<00:04:22.960> there<00:04:23.229> has

00:04:23.339 --> 00:04:23.349 
so speaking of air vehicles there has

00:04:23.349 --> 00:04:24.719 
so speaking of air vehicles there has
been<00:04:23.470> a<00:04:23.530> lot<00:04:23.800> of<00:04:23.830> worry<00:04:24.070> that<00:04:24.340> they<00:04:24.430> are<00:04:24.520> going

00:04:24.719 --> 00:04:24.729 
been a lot of worry that they are going

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:26.190 
been a lot of worry that they are going
to<00:04:24.820> be<00:04:24.909> too<00:04:25.060> powerful<00:04:25.240> Jets<00:04:25.780> are<00:04:25.870> gonna<00:04:25.930> fly

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:26.200 
to be too powerful Jets are gonna fly

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:27.000 
to be too powerful Jets are gonna fly
around<00:04:26.320> and<00:04:26.770> just

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.010 
around and just

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:29.190 
around and just
destroy<00:04:27.400> people<00:04:27.730> on<00:04:27.820> the<00:04:27.910> ground<00:04:28.150> and<00:04:28.480> it

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:29.200 
destroy people on the ground and it

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:30.720 
destroy people on the ground and it
looks<00:04:29.440> like<00:04:29.650> from<00:04:29.830> all<00:04:30.040> the<00:04:30.190> information<00:04:30.280> that

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:30.730 
looks like from all the information that

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:32.340 
looks like from all the information that
has<00:04:30.850> been<00:04:30.910> released<00:04:31.240> that<00:04:31.660> dice<00:04:31.900> is<00:04:31.930> really

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:32.350 
has been released that dice is really

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:34.110 
has been released that dice is really
taking<00:04:32.650> a<00:04:32.710> lot<00:04:32.770> of<00:04:32.890> counter<00:04:33.160> measures<00:04:33.460> to<00:04:33.940> make

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:34.120 
taking a lot of counter measures to make

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:36.420 
taking a lot of counter measures to make
sure<00:04:34.150> that<00:04:34.480> people<00:04:34.810> don't<00:04:35.110> feel<00:04:35.680> useless<00:04:36.070> when

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:36.430 
sure that people don't feel useless when

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:40.290 
sure that people don't feel useless when
a<00:04:36.730> a<00:04:37.380> helicopter<00:04:38.380> or<00:04:38.590> a<00:04:39.040> jet<00:04:39.490> is<00:04:39.610> overhead<00:04:40.060> and

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:40.300 
a a helicopter or a jet is overhead and

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:41.820 
a a helicopter or a jet is overhead and
that<00:04:40.480> they<00:04:40.630> really<00:04:40.930> have<00:04:41.200> a<00:04:41.230> lot<00:04:41.380> of<00:04:41.410> tools<00:04:41.620> at

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:41.830 
that they really have a lot of tools at

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:43.200 
that they really have a lot of tools at
their<00:04:41.890> disposal<00:04:41.950> to<00:04:42.400> actually<00:04:42.700> take<00:04:42.880> them<00:04:43.030> out

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:43.210 
their disposal to actually take them out

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:45.960 
their disposal to actually take them out
so<00:04:43.540> there<00:04:44.140> are<00:04:44.470> anti-air<00:04:45.190> vehicles<00:04:45.670> there<00:04:45.940> is

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:45.970 
so there are anti-air vehicles there is

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:48.690 
so there are anti-air vehicles there is
also<00:04:46.300> the<00:04:46.600> support<00:04:46.990> class<00:04:47.230> that<00:04:47.590> has<00:04:47.800> anti-air

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:48.700 
also the support class that has anti-air

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:50.250 
also the support class that has anti-air
missiles<00:04:49.090> it<00:04:49.240> looks<00:04:49.390> like<00:04:49.630> and<00:04:49.870> it<00:04:49.930> looks<00:04:50.080> also

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:50.260 
missiles it looks like and it looks also

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.880 
missiles it looks like and it looks also
I<00:04:50.650> in<00:04:51.580> my<00:04:51.850> in<00:04:52.180> my<00:04:52.390> opinion<00:04:52.690> I<00:04:52.780> thought<00:04:53.020> that<00:04:53.290> the

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:53.890 
I in my in my opinion I thought that the

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:55.710 
I in my in my opinion I thought that the
engineer<00:04:54.460> was<00:04:54.700> going<00:04:54.970> to<00:04:55.120> be<00:04:55.270> the<00:04:55.390> anti

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:55.720 
engineer was going to be the anti

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:57.690 
engineer was going to be the anti
everything<00:04:56.020> vehicle<00:04:56.920> but<00:04:57.160> it<00:04:57.250> looks<00:04:57.400> like<00:04:57.580> the

00:04:57.690 --> 00:04:57.700 
everything vehicle but it looks like the

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:59.100 
everything vehicle but it looks like the
support<00:04:58.000> class<00:04:58.120> is<00:04:58.420> going<00:04:58.690> to<00:04:58.840> have<00:04:58.960> that

00:04:59.100 --> 00:04:59.110 
support class is going to have that

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:01.110 
support class is going to have that
option<00:04:59.290> and<00:04:59.710> it<00:05:00.100> looks<00:05:00.250> like<00:05:00.310> the<00:05:00.610> engineer<00:05:01.030> is

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:01.120 
option and it looks like the engineer is

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:04.650 
option and it looks like the engineer is
going<00:05:01.360> to<00:05:01.450> be<00:05:01.540> more<00:05:01.720> ground-based<00:05:02.460> and<00:05:03.660> less

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:04.660 
going to be more ground-based and less

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:06.570 
going to be more ground-based and less
and<00:05:04.870> well<00:05:05.260> they<00:05:05.470> can<00:05:05.590> also<00:05:05.770> repair<00:05:06.160> vehicles

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:06.580 
and well they can also repair vehicles

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:08.100 
and well they can also repair vehicles
in<00:05:06.730> air<00:05:07.060> vehicles<00:05:07.480> and<00:05:07.600> stuff<00:05:07.720> like<00:05:07.810> that<00:05:07.990> but

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:08.110 
in air vehicles and stuff like that but

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:09.540 
in air vehicles and stuff like that but
it<00:05:08.200> looks<00:05:08.230> like<00:05:08.380> they're<00:05:08.560> gonna<00:05:08.680> be<00:05:08.740> the<00:05:09.310> anti

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:09.550 
it looks like they're gonna be the anti

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:11.820 
it looks like they're gonna be the anti
ground<00:05:09.850> and<00:05:10.180> it<00:05:10.810> looks<00:05:11.020> like<00:05:11.140> support<00:05:11.740> is

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:11.830 
ground and it looks like support is

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:13.800 
ground and it looks like support is
going<00:05:11.950> to<00:05:12.100> be<00:05:12.220> anti<00:05:12.460> air<00:05:12.670> so<00:05:13.000> I'm<00:05:13.180> was<00:05:13.660> kind<00:05:13.780> of

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:13.810 
going to be anti air so I'm was kind of

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:15.170 
going to be anti air so I'm was kind of
interesting<00:05:14.260> twist<00:05:14.470> that<00:05:14.620> I'd<00:05:14.710> like<00:05:14.800> to<00:05:14.830> see

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:15.180 
interesting twist that I'd like to see

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:17.820 
interesting twist that I'd like to see
so<00:05:16.180> some<00:05:16.450> final<00:05:16.600> stuff<00:05:17.050> they<00:05:17.260> have<00:05:17.410> mentioned

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:17.830 
so some final stuff they have mentioned

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:19.380 
so some final stuff they have mentioned
that<00:05:17.920> there<00:05:18.160> is<00:05:18.280> going<00:05:18.460> to<00:05:18.550> be<00:05:18.670> all<00:05:19.000> game<00:05:19.360> modes

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:19.390 
that there is going to be all game modes

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:21.750 
that there is going to be all game modes
on<00:05:19.990> every<00:05:20.440> single<00:05:20.620> map<00:05:20.980> which<00:05:21.280> isn't<00:05:21.490> my

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:21.760 
on every single map which isn't my

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:23.640 
on every single map which isn't my
opinion<00:05:22.120> is<00:05:22.210> a<00:05:22.240> rific<00:05:22.600> is<00:05:22.870> really<00:05:23.200> good<00:05:23.350> to<00:05:23.470> see

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:23.650 
opinion is a rific is really good to see

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:25.500 
opinion is a rific is really good to see
because<00:05:23.980> I<00:05:24.010> remember<00:05:24.310> in<00:05:24.430> Bad<00:05:24.610> Company<00:05:24.850> 2<00:05:25.060> it

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:25.510 
because I remember in Bad Company 2 it

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:27.480 
because I remember in Bad Company 2 it
was<00:05:25.870> a<00:05:25.900> little<00:05:26.200> annoying<00:05:26.500> to<00:05:26.710> plan<00:05:26.920> a<00:05:26.950> map<00:05:27.250> and

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:27.490 
was a little annoying to plan a map and

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:28.890 
was a little annoying to plan a map and
knowing<00:05:27.760> that<00:05:27.940> you<00:05:28.210> could<00:05:28.390> only<00:05:28.510> play<00:05:28.690> that

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:28.900 
knowing that you could only play that

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:30.780 
knowing that you could only play that
actually<00:05:29.320> that<00:05:29.470> one<00:05:29.800> game<00:05:30.070> mode<00:05:30.250> on<00:05:30.490> that<00:05:30.670> one

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:30.790 
actually that one game mode on that one

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:33.540 
actually that one game mode on that one
particular<00:05:31.240> map<00:05:31.480> and<00:05:32.040> some<00:05:33.040> maps<00:05:33.220> I<00:05:33.340> really

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:33.550 
particular map and some maps I really

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:34.770 
particular map and some maps I really
enjoyed<00:05:33.820> playing<00:05:33.850> on<00:05:34.240> and<00:05:34.390> it<00:05:34.450> was<00:05:34.540> really

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:34.780 
enjoyed playing on and it was really

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:36.030 
enjoyed playing on and it was really
disappointing<00:05:34.900> to<00:05:35.380> only<00:05:35.530> be<00:05:35.740> able<00:05:35.800> to<00:05:35.890> play

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:36.040 
disappointing to only be able to play

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:37.830 
disappointing to only be able to play
that<00:05:36.160> one<00:05:36.310> game<00:05:36.520> mode<00:05:36.670> but<00:05:37.330> they're<00:05:37.510> making

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:37.840 
that one game mode but they're making

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:39.030 
that one game mode but they're making
sure<00:05:38.080> that<00:05:38.260> that<00:05:38.380> is<00:05:38.470> not<00:05:38.590> the<00:05:38.650> case<00:05:38.860> in

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:39.040 
sure that that is not the case in

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:41.070 
sure that that is not the case in
battlefield<00:05:39.400> 3<00:05:39.460> and<00:05:39.760> so<00:05:40.240> every<00:05:40.600> single<00:05:40.780> game

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:41.080 
battlefield 3 and so every single game

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:42.510 
battlefield 3 and so every single game
mode<00:05:41.260> is<00:05:41.410> going<00:05:41.590> to<00:05:41.650> be<00:05:41.740> you're<00:05:42.160> gonna<00:05:42.280> be<00:05:42.460> able

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:42.520 
mode is going to be you're gonna be able

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:43.980 
mode is going to be you're gonna be able
to<00:05:42.670> play<00:05:42.790> on<00:05:43.030> every<00:05:43.210> single<00:05:43.540> map<00:05:43.660> so<00:05:43.840> I<00:05:43.870> think

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:43.990 
to play on every single map so I think

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:46.800 
to play on every single map so I think
that's<00:05:44.200> very<00:05:44.380> cool<00:05:44.640> as<00:05:45.640> for<00:05:45.970> snipers<00:05:46.450> I<00:05:46.630> know<00:05:46.690> a

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:46.810 
that's very cool as for snipers I know a
