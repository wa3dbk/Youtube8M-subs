00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:05.700
 Kirsch demanded from the Mediterranean everything is organic 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:11.380
 at 5 and 21 with 2 with a one the k 51 professor and active graphic 

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:12.519
 built 

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:16.570
 and I want to show here how to use the hard drive the ram Hemberg 

00:00:16.569 --> 00:00:17.269
 collided 

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:19.900
 and how that goes from in Warsaw m 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:21.419
 this new platform 

00:00:21.419 --> 00:00:25.919
 I have not suffered anything yet in the netbook Dennis r completely new from 

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:27.210
 therefore have 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.060
 Curling now, you could be on the side and the kitchen and in the kitchen 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.840
 Cercle lying around a lot of Schromm 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.280
 because I had to cost over 30 pieces 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:39.100
 for that break is completely then from the inside can show but that was it 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:39.830
 value 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:42.860
 because I could get a picture of the way and 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:44.820
 um understand now why 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.380
 It's not that loud, for example 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:50.810
 other breaks 1p Pozos could sound 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:53.239
 the drives too rare processor 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:55.030
 which stands here 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:59.700
 so much case at 7 o'clock in space wanted to exchange the hard drive has us all 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:00.239
 register 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:01.799
 made very bad 

00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:05.089
 here the senses screws they are sown are your 1 at 3 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:07.920
 4 5 6 and 7 from the must 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.490
 Here he likes to lose Thiemig Esser copywriter this gaping intended 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.140
 that you can build them, too "confesses 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.140
 So the operations here are also hard disk and the warning sign 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:21.290
 The combing of the Beijing interfered with her at the first time 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:23.650
 Hiking map made because it is quite difficult 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:25.590
 but now it is very easy 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:26.920
 I ask him 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.430
 new York 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.300
 and 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:33.100
 Thank you already see we have 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.150
 a 52-year-old hard drive 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:40.350
 a memory and a fine Kizil Express unfortunately not so often but only 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:44.150
 Klatt you have to yourself here one percent 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:46.560
 next to again 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.630
 So dissolve promise 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.600
 or this actually kept free for the juvenile skate 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.520
 for which there is a slot and were too 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:56.840
 will see soon 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.060
 the one dam her Eichler is present in the case 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.480
 Here you see the role of Sam 

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:05.060
 Picards detect Bluetooth and Wi-Fi 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.140
 London as we speak directly 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.259
 and you can easily have that from the 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:12.409
 William Anane had not seen the show just so 2 

00:02:12.409 --> 00:02:15.219
 But push plastic outwards 

00:02:15.219 --> 00:02:19.239
 and then the whole thing already pops out he thinks lie in ddr3 Rami built 

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:25.120
 I'm not sure if you can have two or four a tree theoretically 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.249
 seen are a maximum of four possible as far as I'm from 

00:02:28.249 --> 00:02:29.239
 a the 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:31.919
 Yesim can be heard but we also have a castle 

00:02:31.919 --> 00:02:34.809
 so I would go with two again for sure 

00:02:34.809 --> 00:02:37.869
 it takes more II finally not n1 q7 the hearted 

00:02:38.589 --> 00:02:41.579
 um can not process so much then what 

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:44.919
 Fiege would come a long way so it was time to start again 

00:02:44.919 --> 00:02:47.089
 Artist page Sunden 

00:02:47.089 --> 00:02:48.149
 reason 

00:02:48.149 --> 00:02:49.409
 communicated to 

00:02:49.409 --> 00:02:51.940
 You can not only see pins if you use them all together 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:53.759
 accompanied by Humboldt 

00:02:53.759 --> 00:02:55.149
 Son Thomas is in it 

00:02:55.149 --> 00:02:56.219
 that worked 

00:02:56.219 --> 00:02:58.649
 not screwed this further 

00:02:58.649 --> 00:03:02.209
 Percent but we have here on the sides like that 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:05.169
 June is not quite stable for you, you just have to go here 

00:03:05.169 --> 00:03:05.929
 antics 

00:03:05.929 --> 00:03:08.049
 Goals that have an effect 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:11.349
 so you have to go outside and then they just test us 

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:13.409
 which failed 

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:16.870
 so and then you have here already the performance of title 2 50 here 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:17.699
 hard disk 

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:18.560
 the one 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.949
 Scorpio Pluess in this case 

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:22.489
 of course in the future 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:26.049
 Canisters also obstruct something else Mansons then sees the ones we have here 

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:29.389
 the hard drive and these 

00:03:29.389 --> 00:03:33.819
 or those feet that are stuck here or the criticism because it is 

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:36.819
 not long 

00:03:37.929 --> 00:03:41.549
 they are screwed on here as well as you just have to do this with Hansa 

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:43.479
 this agreement with the Greens 

00:03:43.479 --> 00:03:44.509
 and 

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:47.419
 then it's expensive or her big hard drive has you 

00:03:47.419 --> 00:03:49.749
 to turn it on and then you could do it all 

00:03:49.749 --> 00:03:51.039
 with install 

00:03:51.039 --> 00:03:54.039
 infected with the iPhone 4 Kids Council 

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:59.669
 therefore saw a rich 2-connection course hairdressing 

00:03:59.669 --> 00:04:00.909
 unclear 

00:04:00.909 --> 00:04:02.309
 in addition to impressions 

00:04:02.309 --> 00:04:04.119
 would have liked too 

00:04:04.119 --> 00:04:05.639
 new hard drive 

00:04:05.639 --> 00:04:07.509
 either way nasty bottom 

00:04:07.509 --> 00:04:11.269
 the plants they look over 20 for me 

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:14.150
 The ladies of honor together that I have something completely me already said far 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:15.389
 wanted apart 

00:04:15.389 --> 00:04:17.569
 to continue watching with the short songs 

00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:19.829
 Of course you have to do that first 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:22.800
 the keyboard has relieved itself of the keyboard 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.349
 you can just take out if you still solve the convertible 

00:04:26.349 --> 00:04:29.150
 we know the procedure already shows team works 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:32.909
 just open up here and redeem amounts of board as well as I do 

00:04:32.909 --> 00:04:35.699
 change with it 

00:04:35.699 --> 00:04:37.039
 that destroys that 

00:04:37.039 --> 00:04:40.770
 then it will be solved after countless foam 

00:04:41.349 --> 00:04:45.259
 let's see if I can stream them back all but their strength back though 

00:04:45.259 --> 00:04:47.740
 Actually, everything is nicely labeled and confusing 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:48.569
 returned 

00:04:48.569 --> 00:04:51.180
 then you can do that if we lower the on the Main 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:53.400
 Synaptics multicard city locks 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.870
 so she worked very well 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:57.539
 Titan could be here too 

00:04:57.539 --> 00:05:00.159
 the inner of one's all 

00:05:00.159 --> 00:05:03.419
 Of course, with Buck all the other plants are looking at it 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:07.500
 the processor is on the other side that's just the bottom and that 

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:10.979
 I always think that we are the way Grafite is now dumped it 

00:05:10.979 --> 00:05:12.669
 the complete 

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:13.960
 Bavaria ahead 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:15.259
 the metal 

00:05:15.259 --> 00:05:19.090
 Seiser at 10 04 comes on it and then only from Mittal 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:22.860
 Keyboards 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:25.969
 is cooled and JÃ¶rg Honsel see beautiful 

00:05:25.969 --> 00:05:28.150
 then there is a lot of space everything is 

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:29.629
 4 percent 

00:05:29.629 --> 00:05:31.199
 beautifully processed 

00:05:31.199 --> 00:05:32.819
 but side here we have 

00:05:32.819 --> 00:05:35.259
 with thale fins during ventilation 

00:05:35.259 --> 00:05:38.300
 and yes HDMI is here at the region before 

00:05:38.939 --> 00:05:42.400
 the wireless charging high here said that the BAG had 

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:46.210
 Multicard reader nice big and the goal I do not know what it is 

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:46.789
 but that 

00:05:46.789 --> 00:05:48.050
 Bernd Voss 

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:51.970
 Hats Bluetooth or w-lan or what to do because Circle Mac Plus 

00:05:52.789 --> 00:05:55.380
 hence a work as nothing in the picture 

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:58.520
 I hope I can also offer a first insight there 

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:01.629
 to get into the inner workings of the Acer Aspire One 521 

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:04.889
 GrafenwÃ¶rth a 20 

00:06:04.889 --> 00:06:09.379
 Kostal 30 euros can play full HD movies on the videos and it 

00:06:09.379 --> 00:06:10.669
 Follow soon 

00:06:10.669 --> 00:06:11.990
 come in the rating 

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:15.850
 Kids for watching Euro and a lot of fun upgrading with more RAM 

00:06:15.849 --> 00:06:17.069
 and hard disk 

00:06:17.069 --> 00:06:18.050
 Peres 

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:19.770
 netbooks 

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:20.580
 thanks has to watch
