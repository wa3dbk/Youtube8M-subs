00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
can do in my mind is making crawlers on

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.490 
can do in my mind is making crawlers on
that

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
that

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.310 
that
you<00:02:13.560> know<00:02:13.800> less<00:02:14.070> zombies<00:02:14.490> on<00:02:14.700> you<00:02:15.120> and<00:02:15.390> you

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
you know less zombies on you and you

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:17.720 
you know less zombies on you and you
know<00:02:16.410> of<00:02:16.710> course<00:02:16.860> going<00:02:17.130> to<00:02:17.190> make<00:02:17.280> it<00:02:17.370> easier

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
know of course going to make it easier

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.100 
know of course going to make it easier
if<00:02:17.820> there's<00:02:18.000> less<00:02:18.120> zombies<00:02:18.420> on<00:02:18.570> you<00:02:18.750> and<00:02:19.020> you

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
if there's less zombies on you and you

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:20.540 
if there's less zombies on you and you
can<00:02:19.170> see<00:02:19.290> how<00:02:19.320> fast<00:02:19.650> a<00:02:19.770> zombie<00:02:20.070> is<00:02:20.190> and<00:02:20.460> just

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
can see how fast a zombie is and just

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.580 
can see how fast a zombie is and just
like<00:02:20.790> with<00:02:21.120> the<00:02:21.240> m14<00:02:21.600> no<00:02:21.780> that<00:02:21.990> is<00:02:22.110> not<00:02:22.230> a<00:02:22.290> mod

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
like with the m14 no that is not a mod

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.770 
like with the m14 no that is not a mod
and<00:02:23.090> just<00:02:24.090> to<00:02:24.180> throw<00:02:24.330> it<00:02:24.450> out<00:02:24.570> there<00:02:24.720> my

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
and just to throw it out there my

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.450 
and just to throw it out there my
fingers<00:02:25.170> killing<00:02:25.650> me<00:02:25.770> right<00:02:25.800> now<00:02:25.950> shooting

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:26.460 
fingers killing me right now shooting

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:29.060 
fingers killing me right now shooting
that<00:02:26.670> fashion<00:02:27.060> past<00:02:27.270> like<00:02:27.480> two<00:02:28.350> days<00:02:28.560> is<00:02:28.830> just

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
that fashion past like two days is just

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:30.470 
that fashion past like two days is just
ridiculous<00:02:29.580> but<00:02:29.850> yeah<00:02:30.180> so<00:02:30.330> basically

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
ridiculous but yeah so basically

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.420 
ridiculous but yeah so basically
crawlers<00:02:31.440> mean<00:02:31.650> you<00:02:31.740> know<00:02:31.860> of<00:02:32.010> course<00:02:32.130> less

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
crawlers mean you know of course less

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.550 
crawlers mean you know of course less
zombies<00:02:32.820> on<00:02:32.940> you<00:02:33.150> makes<00:02:33.750> it<00:02:33.870> easier<00:02:34.110> strides

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
zombies on you makes it easier strides

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:35.900 
zombies on you makes it easier strides
like<00:02:34.800> hoping<00:02:35.160> you<00:02:35.280> know<00:02:35.370> maybe<00:02:35.610> I'll<00:02:35.790> get

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
like hoping you know maybe I'll get

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:37.550 
like hoping you know maybe I'll get
passes<00:02:36.330> but<00:02:36.540> I<00:02:36.600> was<00:02:36.870> like<00:02:37.020> pretty<00:02:37.290> sure<00:02:37.530> I

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
passes but I was like pretty sure I

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:38.990 
passes but I was like pretty sure I
wasn't<00:02:37.890> gonna<00:02:38.070> be<00:02:38.220> able<00:02:38.310> to<00:02:38.459> do<00:02:38.550> it<00:02:38.580> because

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
wasn't gonna be able to do it because

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.260 
wasn't gonna be able to do it because
it's<00:02:39.300> just<00:02:39.390> I<00:02:40.250> don't<00:02:41.250> even<00:02:41.310> know<00:02:41.670> I<00:02:41.850> just<00:02:41.940> like

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
it's just I don't even know I just like

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:44.150 
it's just I don't even know I just like
all<00:02:42.420> there<00:02:42.540> goes<00:02:42.690> like<00:02:42.810> five<00:02:43.050> hours<00:02:43.080> I<00:02:43.440> did

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160
