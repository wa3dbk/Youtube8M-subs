 I have a dms for you I was at 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:12.450
 wm several times here still am down there 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:16.020
 a quince and have bought a lot 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:18.660
 from the new year in the products 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.490
 gone and I have until the end of the 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.380
 year I waited okay okay I start 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.150
 only in the new year with my the 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.949
 shopping and that's why I have it now 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.670
 also made over the days with the 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:31.439
 tomorrow to the dm and have my things 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.989
 Bought that I am so in the times 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.630
 one likes to buy again actually 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.579
 more than you planned because there 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.620
 always something that comes to my mind 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.260
 at least and that's what I would say 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.070
 I start directly start times like this 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.100
 small steps 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:50.280
 I have this barrier once 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:53.160
 cuddly cleansing cloths buys in 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.870
 These circles size I think the awesome 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.100
 They cleanse the face for the first time 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.500
 to make the make-up off 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:02.910
 for that I use the first line and 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:05.100
 then a cleaning but so make 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.600
 up to remove mascara to remove 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.369
 I think that's very good here again 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.040
 doctor scheller facial cream at this time 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:13.560
 but the organic rosmarin anti age 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.500
 day care the other he was such a 24 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:19.740
 hours of moisturizing and there me 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.570
 yes 27 am and mine and want to prevent 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.060
 to get wrinkles I have not me 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.830
 then just bought these I am very 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.540
 satisfied with the products especially 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.180
 because it also costs natural cosmetics 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:33.299
 products are free and no parabens 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:37.020
 of silicone mineral substances is 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:39.540
 and is still great for my skin type 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.430
 I also like it every now and then 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.560
 respond to products and to the 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.390
 What's not done is finished 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.880
 I bought a night care 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.640
 have it from la vera that it 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:53.700
 again a punctual night care anti 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.259
 aging and hyaluron is also here 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.320
 be is also so an endogenous 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:59.470
 fabric again for the 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:01.120
 so the skin takes care of it and she thereby 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.670
 simply reduces wrinkles and 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:05.830
 be prevented over night 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:07.150
 I wear it then and this one too 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:09.009
 bit richer than such a 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:10.390
 Day cream may also be suitable over this 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:11.860
 You really wear makeup 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:13.780
 Do not be surprised about my nails 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:15.370
 i have different colors here because 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.209
 I made the colors I had the same 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.390
 show 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:21.580
 and here I have my one 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:24.070
 bought shampoo category 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:26.560
 pure janko I have since I 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:30.489
 Thinking can always be used 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:32.620
 also not expensive and I'm great so 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:33.670
 I always have very good experiences with 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.650
 made this product 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:37.150
 then I have the next one here 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:38.770
 Production threw in that two 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:40.930
 nail polishes of essence that are so 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:43.959
 newer colors so little white 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:46.480
 his name was dull and he is shiny and 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:48.220
 these are beautiful colors my god 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.950
 The covering power is awesome 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:53.320
 The formula really is this color intensity 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:55.480
 is that if you really live it now 

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:59.890
 looks is so awesome and especially this one 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:03.280
 matte nail polish looks so beautiful holds 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:05.890
 also for a long time I already have that from 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.209
 three days once applied and I am 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:08.709
 I'm not sure which color 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:11.890
 I should wear now if it is red 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:14.070
 should give or this pink I would 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:17.829
 However, my nails yet I hone 

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:20.079
 have you 2000 in this eternal form 

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:21.700
 but I think I'm leaving 

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:24.160
 again a bit in the rounded 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:25.720
 form fits i believe you suits me 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.760
 as well as anxious for two days 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:29.110
 i bought love eating nail polish 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.810
 then I'm still popkomm 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:35.410

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:37.299
 i love salty popcorn i dont know 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:38.890
 do you like to get salty or you 

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:40.840
 you can say in the comments if 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:43.390
 you are so salty or sweet type 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:47.920
 then comes next 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:50.590
 I bought something here again and 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:52.900
 while there are 35 peeling waits patch from 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:55.750
 Ebeleben I've never tested 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:57.160
 and there are many nubs that should 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:57.580
 I believe these pills the effect 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:00.640
 to have 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:03.070
 I'm curious how they are and then have 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.480
 I still head here accused 

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:06.130

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:16.870

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:19.000
 we are very practical then I have me 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:20.919

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.650
 I always lose that oh god I know

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:26.950

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:29.380
 I'm not the only woman binder now 

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:32.440

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:38.940
 I am still entering the country for years 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:41.440

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:43.660

 I'll take the pack with me then 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:48.150
 But I think of valea 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:50.169
 Shaving cream bought aloe vera 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:51.910
 sensitive skin I do not know how 

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:55.660
 that smells the cheap the first time I 

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:57.430
 otherwise always had some of - and 

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:58.910
 thought okay I give it a try in 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:03.050
 then I have 

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:06.530
 a few more teachers kreml bodylotion 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:09.200
 this is a velvety intensive care 

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:10.790
 for dry and stressed skin with 

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:12.710
 40 images in part 

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:15.170
 that too limited I'm so excited 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:16.820
 I have not tested it yet but that 

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:19.190
 Smells so if so then I have 

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:21.950
 I bought again in the sender brush from 

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:23.930
 ebeleben and I think great for the 

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:26.240
 Price is not the best quality now 

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:28.760
 in terms of the brush to cure before 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:30.290
 but all my god if you then 

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:33.020
 Publisher does not do it as it does 

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:35.510
 you buy a brush for 30 40 euro 

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:36.950
 and especially for beginners the 

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:38.720
 not necessarily too much money now 

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:40.490
 I want to spend for brushes 

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:42.530
 the very good one always needs blendl 

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:44.300
 That's why I always buy brushes 

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:46.880
 again one of them I have here 

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:49.130
 of essence a eyebrow brother 

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:51.080
 I bought you a video 

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:52.730
 asked if he once drove me out of the drugstore 

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:53.840

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:55.910
 these are recommended here 

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:58.250
 That's why I want to thank you 

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:59.510
 of course also patrice 

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:01.010
 I'm back to my single first 

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:04.130

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:05.750

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:08.150
 meanwhile you know them already 

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:09.410
 from my videos and I think so 

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:11.510

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:14.390
