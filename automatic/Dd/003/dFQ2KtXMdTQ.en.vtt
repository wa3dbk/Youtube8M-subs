prefer<00:01:41.100> to<00:01:41.130> use<00:01:41.400> the<00:01:41.550> brush<00:01:41.790> as<00:01:41.970> much<00:01:42.180> because

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
prefer to use the brush as much because

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.800 
prefer to use the brush as much because
I<00:01:42.990> feel<00:01:43.200> like<00:01:43.230> it's<00:01:43.560> more<00:01:44.210> thoroughly<00:01:45.210> if<00:01:45.660> I

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
I feel like it's more thoroughly if I

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.660 
I feel like it's more thoroughly if I
use<00:01:45.960> my<00:01:46.140> hands<00:01:46.530> that<00:01:47.010> way<00:01:47.190> I<00:01:47.220> could<00:01:47.400> actually

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
use my hands that way I could actually

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.120 
use my hands that way I could actually
feel<00:01:48.210> the<00:01:48.390> hair<00:01:48.600> and<00:01:48.810> I<00:01:49.350> can<00:01:49.380> feel<00:01:49.830> that<00:01:50.040> the

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
feel the hair and I can feel that the

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.820 
feel the hair and I can feel that the
hair<00:01:50.310> is<00:01:50.370> actually<00:01:50.760> wet<00:01:51.360> because<00:01:52.110> the<00:01:52.620> more

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:52.830 
hair is actually wet because the more

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:57.350 
hair is actually wet because the more
wet<00:01:53.400> it<00:01:53.700> is<00:01:54.680> the<00:01:55.680> more<00:01:55.860> likely<00:01:56.310> you<00:01:56.910> know<00:01:56.940> that

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
wet it is the more likely you know that

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.150 
wet it is the more likely you know that
all<00:01:57.450> the<00:01:57.660> color<00:01:57.900> has<00:01:58.140> actually<00:01:58.650> penetrate

00:01:59.150 --> 00:01:59.160 
all the color has actually penetrate

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.040 
all the color has actually penetrate
into<00:01:59.400> the<00:01:59.580> hair<00:01:59.700> so<00:02:00.390> it<00:02:00.420> won't<00:02:00.750> be<00:02:00.900> any

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:01.050 
into the hair so it won't be any

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:03.200 
into the hair so it won't be any
strength<00:02:01.470> and<00:02:02.130> I'm<00:02:02.310> just<00:02:02.550> flipping<00:02:02.790> sighs

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
strength and I'm just flipping sighs

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.690 
strength and I'm just flipping sighs
here<00:02:03.690> and<00:02:04.050> doing<00:02:04.860> the<00:02:04.920> same<00:02:05.100> thing<00:02:05.370> on<00:02:05.520> the

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
here and doing the same thing on the

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.270 
here and doing the same thing on the
other<00:02:05.730> side<00:02:05.910> and<00:02:06.510> I'm<00:02:07.200> doing<00:02:07.710> a<00:02:07.770> little<00:02:07.950> bit<00:02:08.160> on

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
other side and I'm doing a little bit on

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.190 
other side and I'm doing a little bit on
the<00:02:08.369> tracks<00:02:08.670> I'm<00:02:08.940> not<00:02:09.090> really<00:02:09.210> focusing<00:02:09.780> too

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200

the tracks I'm not really focusing too
much<00:02:10.230> on<00:02:10.530> actual<00:02:11.280> tracks<00:02:11.640> because<00:02:12.240> the<00:02:12.720> track

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
much on actual tracks because the track

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.170 
much on actual tracks because the track
is<00:02:13.020> not<00:02:13.410> going<00:02:13.560> to<00:02:13.650> be<00:02:13.710> shown<00:02:13.920> anyway<00:02:14.310> so<00:02:14.370> if

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:36.260 
want it to be a little bit more brownish
color<00:02:33.510> and<00:02:33.840> then<00:02:34.470> I'm<00:02:34.709> going<00:02:34.950> to<00:02:35.100> gradually<00:02:35.670> on

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 
color and then I'm going to gradually on

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:37.130 
color and then I'm going to gradually on
by<00:02:36.570> the<00:02:36.630> hair

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
by the hair

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.250 
by the hair
so<00:02:37.980> I<00:02:38.010> basically<00:02:38.310> used<00:02:38.850> one<00:02:39.300> pack<00:02:39.660> of<00:02:39.900> hair<00:02:40.050> dye

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
so I basically used one pack of hair dye

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.780 
so I basically used one pack of hair dye
for<00:02:41.010> each<00:02:41.160> bundle

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:48.580 

and<00:02:44.830> now<00:02:45.830> I'm<00:02:46.129> just<00:02:46.659> wrapping<00:02:47.659> it<00:02:47.750> in<00:02:48.079> this

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
and now I'm just wrapping it in this

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.640 
and now I'm just wrapping it in this
foil<00:02:48.980> because<00:02:49.310> this<00:02:49.909> will<00:02:50.120> make<00:02:50.299> the<00:02:51.019> color

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
foil because this will make the color

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:54.850 
foil because this will make the color
develop<00:02:52.640> quicker<00:02:53.000> because<00:02:53.989> the<00:02:54.409> foil<00:02:54.709> will

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:54.860 
develop quicker because the foil will

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:57.399 
develop quicker because the foil will
create<00:02:55.129> heat<00:02:55.519> and<00:02:55.879> heat<00:02:56.390> makes<00:02:56.780> the<00:02:56.930> color

00:02:57.399 --> 00:02:57.409 
create heat and heat makes the color

00:02:57.409 --> 00:03:00.309 
create heat and heat makes the color
develop<00:02:57.890> faster<00:02:58.310> somehow<00:02:58.700> and<00:02:59.090> I<00:02:59.870> left<00:03:00.049> it<00:03:00.230> in

00:03:00.309 --> 00:03:00.319 
develop faster somehow and I left it in

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:03.550 
develop faster somehow and I left it in
for<00:03:00.590> about<00:03:00.709> one<00:03:01.430> hour<00:03:01.700> and<00:03:02.180> this<00:03:03.170> is<00:03:03.319> how<00:03:03.440> it

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
for about one hour and this is how it

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.899 
for about one hour and this is how it
looks<00:03:03.739> when<00:03:04.459> it's<00:03:04.760> done<00:03:05.180> this<00:03:06.019> is<00:03:06.170> the<00:03:06.290> 18<00:03:06.620> inch

00:03:06.899 --> 00:03:06.909 
looks when it's done this is the 18 inch

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:09.490 
looks when it's done this is the 18 inch
I<00:03:07.909> use<00:03:08.269> a<00:03:08.480> different<00:03:08.720> type<00:03:09.049> of<00:03:09.079> hair<00:03:09.349> dye<00:03:09.470> on

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500 
I use a different type of hair dye on

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.580 
I use a different type of hair dye on
the<00:03:09.739> 18<00:03:10.099> inch<00:03:10.280> I<00:03:10.489> used<00:03:11.000> cream<00:03:11.510> of<00:03:11.750> nature<00:03:12.290> and

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:12.590 
the 18 inch I used cream of nature and

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:17.080 
the 18 inch I used cream of nature and
the<00:03:13.010> color<00:03:13.280> is<00:03:13.400> called<00:03:13.579> ginger<00:03:14.150> blonde<00:03:15.340> 9.3<00:03:16.340> so

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.090 
the color is called ginger blonde 9.3 so

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:19.420 
the color is called ginger blonde 9.3 so
that<00:03:17.269> was<00:03:17.390> the<00:03:17.510> 18<00:03:17.810> inch<00:03:18.019> now<00:03:18.379> for<00:03:18.799> the<00:03:18.890> 20<00:03:19.250> inch

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430 
that was the 18 inch now for the 20 inch

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:22.750 
that was the 18 inch now for the 20 inch
and<00:03:19.760> also<00:03:20.329> on<00:03:20.690> the<00:03:20.870> 22<00:03:21.319> inch<00:03:21.530> I<00:03:21.739> use<00:03:22.040> the<00:03:22.370> dark

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760 
and also on the 22 inch I use the dark

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:28.869 
and also on the 22 inch I use the dark
and<00:03:22.970> lovely<00:03:23.349> number<00:03:24.349> 384<00:03:27.579> so<00:03:28.579> when<00:03:28.790> you

00:03:28.869 --> 00:03:28.879 
and lovely number 384 so when you

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:31.420 
and lovely number 384 so when you
compare<00:03:29.389> these<00:03:30.200> two<00:03:30.260> you<00:03:30.769> can<00:03:30.799> see<00:03:30.980> that<00:03:31.310> the

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:31.430 
compare these two you can see that the

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:34.119 
compare these two you can see that the
18<00:03:31.760> inch<00:03:31.940> is<00:03:32.150> a<00:03:32.180> little<00:03:32.540> bit<00:03:32.629> lighter<00:03:32.959> which<00:03:33.950> I

00:03:34.119 --> 00:03:34.129 
18 inch is a little bit lighter which I

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:36.129 
18 inch is a little bit lighter which I
wanted<00:03:34.549> as<00:03:34.670> well<00:03:34.700> because<00:03:35.569> it's<00:03:35.720> going<00:03:35.870> to<00:03:36.019> be

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:36.139 
wanted as well because it's going to be

00:03:36.139 --> 00:03:38.170 
wanted as well because it's going to be
on<00:03:36.200> the<00:03:36.260> top<00:03:36.470> of<00:03:36.590> my<00:03:36.680> head<00:03:36.859> now<00:03:37.609> I've<00:03:37.909> marked

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:38.180 
on the top of my head now I've marked

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:40.899 
on the top of my head now I've marked
out<00:03:38.540> where<00:03:39.019> I<00:03:39.049> want<00:03:39.349> my<00:03:39.470> own<00:03:39.769> break<00:03:40.069> to<00:03:40.370> start

00:03:40.899 --> 00:03:40.909 
out where I want my own break to start

00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:44.920 
out where I want my own break to start
and<00:03:41.440> on<00:03:42.440> each<00:03:42.680> bundle<00:03:43.129> obviously<00:03:43.639> I<00:03:43.930> marked

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:44.930 
and on each bundle obviously I marked

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:47.440 
and on each bundle obviously I marked
them<00:03:45.019> on<00:03:45.230> differently<00:03:45.829> lengths<00:03:46.400> because<00:03:46.790> when

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:47.450 
them on differently lengths because when

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:49.689 
them on differently lengths because when
I<00:03:47.480> wear<00:03:47.810> the<00:03:48.079> hair<00:03:48.379> they're<00:03:49.010> always<00:03:49.160> going<00:03:49.579> to

00:03:49.689 --> 00:03:49.699 
I wear the hair they're always going to

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:51.189 
I wear the hair they're always going to
fall<00:03:50.030> in<00:03:50.239> different<00:03:50.599> lengths<00:03:50.870> because<00:03:51.079> they

00:03:51.189 --> 00:03:51.199 
fall in different lengths because they

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:53.979 
fall in different lengths because they
are<00:03:51.319> different<00:03:51.560> lengths<00:03:51.919> so<00:03:52.730> I<00:03:52.760> try<00:03:53.359> to<00:03:53.419> make

00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:53.989 
are different lengths so I try to make

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:59.680 
are different lengths so I try to make
this<00:03:54.410> little<00:03:55.750> diagonal<00:03:56.750> shape<00:03:57.709> so<00:03:58.400> that<00:03:58.690> once

00:03:59.680 --> 00:03:59.690 
this little diagonal shape so that once

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:04.140 
this little diagonal shape so that once
I<00:03:59.870> wear<00:04:00.079> it<00:04:00.290> it<00:04:00.739> will<00:04:00.799> fall<00:04:01.280> accordingly<00:04:02.209> like

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.150 
I wear it it will fall accordingly like

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:07.420 
I wear it it will fall accordingly like
so<00:04:05.150> and<00:04:05.510> this<00:04:06.139> is<00:04:06.199> the<00:04:06.290> color<00:04:06.620> I<00:04:06.919> used<00:04:07.190> once

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:07.430 
so and this is the color I used once

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:10.030 
so and this is the color I used once
again<00:04:07.760> this<00:04:08.269> is<00:04:08.389> a<00:04:08.419> different<00:04:08.870> package<00:04:09.199> now<00:04:09.440> so

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:10.040 
again this is a different package now so

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:12.490 
again this is a different package now so
I<00:04:10.069> use<00:04:10.280> basically<00:04:10.669> two<00:04:11.030> of<00:04:11.060> these<00:04:11.359> but<00:04:12.169> this

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:12.500 
I use basically two of these but this

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:14.800 
I use basically two of these but this
one<00:04:12.739> now<00:04:12.980> I'm<00:04:13.220> using<00:04:13.489> only<00:04:13.819> to<00:04:14.269> create<00:04:14.599> the

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:14.810 
one now I'm using only to create the

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:18.099 
one now I'm using only to create the
ombre<00:04:15.230> effect<00:04:15.590> after<00:04:15.829> diet<00:04:16.609> over<00:04:16.970> here<00:04:17.180> so<00:04:17.959> as

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:18.109 
ombre effect after diet over here so as

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:20.080 
ombre effect after diet over here so as
you<00:04:18.229> can<00:04:18.349> see<00:04:18.410> the<00:04:19.160> consistency<00:04:19.519> of<00:04:19.940> this

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:20.090 
you can see the consistency of this

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:22.089 
you can see the consistency of this
cream<00:04:20.359> is<00:04:20.539> a<00:04:20.570> little<00:04:20.870> bit<00:04:20.959> thicker<00:04:21.229> and<00:04:21.530> it's

00:04:22.089 --> 00:04:22.099 
cream is a little bit thicker and it's

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:24.070 
cream is a little bit thicker and it's
more<00:04:22.280> white<00:04:22.520> and<00:04:22.789> that's<00:04:23.030> because<00:04:23.300> this<00:04:23.449> color

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:24.080 
more white and that's because this color

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.170 
more white and that's because this color
is<00:04:24.320> a<00:04:24.500> lot<00:04:24.919> stronger<00:04:25.310> than<00:04:25.550> the<00:04:25.760> dark<00:04:26.000> and

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:26.180 
is a lot stronger than the dark and

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:28.719 
is a lot stronger than the dark and
lovely<00:04:26.270> color<00:04:26.770> so<00:04:27.770> how<00:04:27.919> much<00:04:28.099> leaves<00:04:28.460> in<00:04:28.639> the

00:04:28.719 --> 00:04:28.729 
lovely color so how much leaves in the

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:30.399 
lovely color so how much leaves in the
comb<00:04:29.000> now

00:04:30.399 --> 00:04:30.409 
comb now

00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:32.020 
comb now
well<00:04:30.860> I'm<00:04:30.949> starting<00:04:31.340> to<00:04:31.370> anyways<00:04:31.760> and<00:04:31.940> then

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:32.030 
well I'm starting to anyways and then

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:33.750 
well I'm starting to anyways and then
afterwards<00:04:32.659> I<00:04:32.780> use<00:04:33.409> just

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:33.760 
afterwards I use just

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:36.210 
afterwards I use just
my<00:04:33.820> fingers<00:04:34.240> and<00:04:34.570> make<00:04:35.500> sure<00:04:35.740> the<00:04:35.980> cream

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:36.220 
my fingers and make sure the cream

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:39.570 
my fingers and make sure the cream
actually<00:04:36.900> penetrated<00:04:37.900> into<00:04:38.080> the<00:04:38.320> hair<00:04:38.680> and

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:39.580 
actually penetrated into the hair and

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:43.080

I'm<00:04:39.880> using<00:04:40.090> quite<00:04:40.390> a<00:04:40.510> lot<00:04:40.810> I've<00:04:41.530> used<00:04:42.090> probably

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:43.090 
I'm using quite a lot I've used probably

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:45.540 
I'm using quite a lot I've used probably
half<00:04:43.600> the<00:04:43.630> bottle<00:04:44.140> while<00:04:44.770> doing<00:04:45.130> this<00:04:45.280> three

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:45.550 
half the bottle while doing this three

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:49.140 
half the bottle while doing this three
bundles<00:04:46.380> then<00:04:47.380> when<00:04:48.070> I<00:04:48.100> rinsed<00:04:48.670> it<00:04:48.760> out<00:04:48.880> I

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:49.150 
bundles then when I rinsed it out I

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:52.530 
bundles then when I rinsed it out I
still<00:04:49.720> felt<00:04:50.050> like<00:04:50.110> it<00:04:50.440> was<00:04:50.560> too<00:04:50.920> dark<00:04:51.160> I<00:04:51.640> put<00:04:52.450> it

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:52.540 
still felt like it was too dark I put it

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:56.490 
still felt like it was too dark I put it
in<00:04:52.630> up<00:04:52.810> the<00:04:53.530> for<00:04:53.860> once<00:04:54.250> again<00:04:54.460> and<00:04:55.060> I<00:04:56.020> lasted

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:56.500 
in up the for once again and I lasted

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:59.040 
in up the for once again and I lasted
him<00:04:56.620> probably<00:04:57.130> for<00:04:57.430> yet<00:04:57.910> another<00:04:58.090> hour<00:04:58.570> to<00:04:58.930> be

00:04:59.040 --> 00:04:59.050 
him probably for yet another hour to be

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:01.110 
him probably for yet another hour to be
honest<00:04:59.350> and<00:04:59.590> it<00:05:00.100> was<00:05:00.220> still<00:05:00.520> not<00:05:00.730> as<00:05:00.970> the

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:01.120 
honest and it was still not as the

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:03.210 
honest and it was still not as the
lightest<00:05:01.390> I<00:05:01.480> wanted<00:05:01.810> it<00:05:01.930> so<00:05:01.960> because<00:05:02.950> I<00:05:02.980> had

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:03.220 
lightest I wanted it so because I had

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:08.040 
lightest I wanted it so because I had
half<00:05:03.810> the<00:05:04.810> bottom<00:05:05.140> left<00:05:05.410> I<00:05:05.680> actually<00:05:06.510> put<00:05:07.510> the

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:08.050 
half the bottom left I actually put the

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:11.700 
half the bottom left I actually put the
rest<00:05:08.290> of<00:05:08.440> the<00:05:08.530> half<00:05:08.680> on<00:05:09.340> again<00:05:10.140> to<00:05:11.140> create<00:05:11.350> the

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:11.710 
rest of the half on again to create the

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:43.930 
rest of the half on again to create the
look<00:05:11.860> that<00:05:12.160> you're<00:05:12.550> going<00:05:12.790> to<00:05:13.000> see

fully<00:05:47.580> dried<00:05:47.910> and<00:05:48.180> look<00:05:48.750> at<00:05:48.930> these<00:05:49.050> and<00:05:49.350> they

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:04.650 
however I'm used to a little bit more

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:07.129 
however I'm used to a little bit more
blonde<00:07:05.310> color<00:07:05.760> so<00:07:06.150> I'm<00:07:06.270> actually<00:07:06.450> considering

00:07:07.129 --> 00:07:07.139 
blonde color so I'm actually considering

00:07:07.139 --> 00:07:10.400 
blonde color so I'm actually considering
maybe<00:07:08.070> dyeing<00:07:08.669> it<00:07:08.880> even<00:07:09.389> lighter<00:07:09.599> but<00:07:09.930> for<00:07:10.200> now

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:10.410 
maybe dyeing it even lighter but for now
