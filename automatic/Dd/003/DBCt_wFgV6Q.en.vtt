00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.339
 welcome from the mobile worker 2015 where 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.750
 here we have the new samsung galaxy s 6 as 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:10.260
 write that there are six in the middle 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.670
 bottom right the iphone 6 the big one 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.230
 Here's what differentiated samsung in particular 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.400
 on the mwc has emphasized in comparison to 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.500
 yourself aware not to oppose the 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.880
 camera but the new s different 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.660
 expert twice as fast for example 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:23.070
 can charge 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:24.689
 like the ms 6 plus though it's 2900 media 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.039
 I think as a battery has huge 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.189
 correspondingly but somehow yes 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:31.140
 Also a big big screen of 5.5 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.329
 inch here with only 5.1 but each one should 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.800
 a 2006 media so about ten 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.510
 percent still differed twice 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.250
 we can quickly get the samsung here 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.610
 charge or the samsung goes charging 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.780
 like the iphone 6x great but of course 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.250
 There are other interesting techniques 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.260
 there we correspondingly easy yet 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.620
 but we will explain the design times 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.149
 on 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.500
 because that is also a crucial one 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.449
 cause for example that we are here at 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.949
 Samsung also finally used metal 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.809
 So here once out of the room 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.969
 completely made of metal the device also the 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.770
 back here the iphone too to 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.539
 example completely made of metal here 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.760
 but then a glass of gorilla glass 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.930
 film to be exact what a blatant is that 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.880
 It is quite nice , for example 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.560
 a wrap or a foil like 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.640
 I now on the iPhone 6 to 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.260
 an example where, for example, an apple 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.610
 would scratch relatively easily 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.409
 besides, we only have an 8 here 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.659
 Megapixel camera while samsung here 16 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.950
 the htc is the same 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.689
 So we can continue our pulse 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.479
 otherwise measure the lightning and continue 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:23.340
 Of course, it's pretty much the same 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:25.350
 55 inches against 5.1 should now who 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.280
 actually from higher hennig so must 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.950
 we already have the differences here 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.619
 We can clearly see the size 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.390
 that the iphone 6 plus is a knocker 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.590
 he is really big i can get you 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.140
 Here the samsung has put forward 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.210
 and then you see , it's really enough 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.330
 first with the outside around here 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.360
 device around 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:44.800
 here again centimeters or 107 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.450
 centimeters each cut off 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:47.920
 whether we see them watch from the side 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:49.780
 we are harmless in the thickness 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.610
 also the buttons and connections are 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:55.510
 pretty much yes I do not say copied now 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:56.740
 but similar especially if we are not 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:58.840
 that arise in the matches for 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.740
 for easy import of another 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.870
 above 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:03.100
 but what we have samsung in it is 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:04.870
 an infrared sensor that's great 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:09.010
 Practically, for example, we have 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:10.810
 the iphone not so let's go here 1 

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:12.480
 1 of the main features we at all 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.650
 here phones probably use of 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.190
 no matter which production method is the 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:16.690
 camera 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:18.190
 I already mentioned that at samsung 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.200
 twice as many at high resolution 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:21.970
 Apple believes in the back and the front 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.830
 I only have two megapixels left here 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.900
 even we are five megapixel and are too 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:26.800
 low light being aligned with the 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.750
 apple actually quite good 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.920
 managed because that's exactly 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:31.870
 the same hardware has as 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.040
 example take the normal s6 now 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:34.480
 Just compare the two 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.860
 that is our object that many 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.400
 I want to take photos in a short time 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:38.400
 the camera a 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.290
 and we start to shine with that 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:45.739
 safety because that was just open here 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:47.180
 I 'll turn around all the time and then 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:49.939
 we see the wide angle is a lot much 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.870
 much better of samsung galaxy s 6 

00:02:49.939 --> 00:02:55.879
 and 3 6 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:58.040
 that is exactly the iphone 6 plus 

00:02:55.879 --> 00:02:59.180
 easy from the wide angle not at all 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.859
 so beautiful and not quite as sharp 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:02.450
 So on my drive you see many 

00:03:00.859 --> 00:03:04.250
 details or at the grid above or at 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:05.540
 the lamps such as the iphone 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:07.220
 I would not have to be visible 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:09.950
 completely in the right hold so bad 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:12.859
 is wide so we turn times 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:14.150
 both by the way to a maximum 

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:17.389
 screen brightness adjusted 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:18.950
 if such 100 are the farm ok i 

00:03:17.389 --> 00:03:20.659
 must really admit to the iphone 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:22.639
 just lifelike so scottish 

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:25.579
 in fact and the iphone or 

00:03:22.639 --> 00:03:26.930
 samsung galaxy s edge too and the 16th 

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:29.060
 with the conscious not behind 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:31.069
 With two branches, it fits 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:34.519
 just a lot more in the picture at it 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:35.959
 a pity on the iphone 6 plus, though 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:36.920
 Well you can not win everywhere 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:38.959
 but i can give you the attitude here 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:40.189
 go short and the whole synonymous weitwinkel 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:42.949
 maybe you can see then 

00:03:40.189 --> 00:03:44.299
 a little more or 16 megapixels 

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:45.949
 at least, looking a bit 

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:47.930
 better but not quite so 

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:49.810
 good as the six plus will now 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:52.930
 definitely say 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:54.220
 exactly what else I want now 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:55.750
 not at all compare my weight 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:57.250
 batteries are so I had to at the 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:58.390
 it's six more out there 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:59.680
 when we come back soon 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:01.780
 the counting very short 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:03.970
 Comparison for the largest so to speak 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:04.900
 Thick and the feel feels 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:06.459
 Both are great 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:08.500
 everything now metal of course and 

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:10.330
 similarly well processed but the price 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:12.519
 chamberlain not from iphone of new 

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:14.019
 Samsung Galaxy S 6 past the tenth 

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:15.880
 april weather shines and until then if you 

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:16.959
 In any case around the 800 euros 

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:18.130
 then probably pay for it 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:19.239
 need for two-wheel safety and 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:20.560
 By the way , you can also the memory 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:22.570
 no more you have to get away from 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:25.330
 beginning at steep slices between 32 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:27.160
 64 or 188 each until next time 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:30.090
 for the stuttering pascal and forget 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:30.090
