 Hi everyone I love potatoes and green onions and introduce the dishes that use them 

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:27.800
 I will 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:31.420
 It is a gratin that can be easily made with fresh cream without white sauce 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:33.010
 Then I will introduce the material 

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:34.240
 Potatoes

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:46.110
 And fresh cream 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:48.490
 Potatoes are are prepared to soften until about passage of the medium-tightening skewer Oh 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:53.370

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:58.190

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.190

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:02.600
 Yes 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:05.630
 There is no gap 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:10.899
 Let's pack together 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:10.899
 Next we will lay onion leeks 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:17.219
 Stop when potato is covering up 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:26.630
 And anchovy 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:31.310
 Place it on top Anchovy please put half of the dose 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:32.650

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:36.920
 this 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:38.950
 To the extent that Imai I can wear the material 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.729

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:41.729
 Please apply 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:47.970
 And again I repeat the operation 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:52.490
 We will continue to put the potatoes 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:57.200
