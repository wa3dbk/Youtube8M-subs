00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:14.220
 she's killing the world I hope you 

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:15.540
 be fine, I'm fine excuse 

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:16.740
 my shit voice but actually I'm coming 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.869
 to wake up but hey it's not 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.910
 yet today we find ourselves 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.159
 an exceptional video have dared the word 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.839
 is not it a modern video 

00:00:23.159 --> 00:00:26.189
 warfare 2 so you go to my opinion 

00:00:24.839 --> 00:00:27.810
 well liked since the time that one has me 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.970
 asked for a video on my flagship two 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.710
 also not forgotten the little bit of m 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.840
 to the intervention so here are the videos 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.460
 on modern warfare 2 to intervention and 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.230
 especially the live ones to 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.780
 the intervention is a bit we will say 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.760
 my trademark on the chain so 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.560
 someone is told or helicopter 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.590
 the arsenic tm the dude will respond live to 

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:47.940
 the intervention in my opinion for little 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.460
 that they know the chain obviously 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.410
 to what is not won but so here 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.990
 live to the intervention what am I 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.430
 tells video commented on the intervention 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:58.200
 I am not a student like you 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.700
 will have noticed 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:02.130
 I was not hot enough yet 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:04.290
 to make a live and actually to 

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:06.330
 cause without lying to you yes then there 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.160
 sorry if I camp a little I admit to go 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.930
 at this spot at the beginning of the game 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:11.670
 until I get killed and play 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.980
 complex absolutely not at this level 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.080
 since it's really an excellent spot 

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:16.440
 to make some frags at the beginning of 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.570
 part 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:20.850
 me after I stay there until I 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.220
 to kill what will not delay the wap 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:26.490
 I'm going to run out of reflexes 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:28.440
 exactly right the history of this 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.690
 gameplay it's just that I have 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:32.820
 turned on my ps3 launched modern warfare 2 se 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:34.800
 had been for a good month and there I you 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.690
 are not lacking it was very honestly 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:38.430
 a good month that I will not play at 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:40.350
 intervention on mana in far of them 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.759
 same on modern warfare 2 I think 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.070
 it was also a good month end brief 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:46.170
 it was really the total disaster 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.720
 I was doing shitty parts 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.070
 and then this gameplay came as a 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.630
 messier then it's true that I have not 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.410
 still found all my little reflexes 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.759
 of old the little quick scope etc 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:58.080
 I'm going a lot have missed a lot of 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.880
 haft coop too i'm going to miss 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.320
 you will notice it well I hope that 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.479
 you understand a little vocabulary that 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:06.090
 I say it's not it's not obvious I 'm 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:08.399
 account in the vocabulary of geeks 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.890
 a little bit of something else but 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.870
 anyway 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:12.880
 and so here you are going to notice 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:15.650
 technically its exceptional size 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:18.860
 but at the score level it's really 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:20.720
 something something that to my 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:23.150
 notice you will very rarely have views on 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.950
 youtube in the sense that at the intervention 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.430
 authentic he in a match but by 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:28.640
 teams 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.450
 yes then the little attention that lateral 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.700
 It's been a long time 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:34.670
 I was saying team match to death 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:36.739
 the limit is at 75 he age indeed 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:39.110
 56 it is necessary to have three 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:40.670
 quarters of the illuminations what is 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:43.040
 really very very good I think you 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:45.170
 will rarely have seen this at the intervention 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.100
 so here yes I apologize for moving forward for 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:48.080
 the opposing team 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:50.739
 it was not very nice but hey the guy 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:52.700
 killed me finally good good it's true 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:53.989
 sorry I sent them a small 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:57.200
 message of excuses 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:03:01.550
 In short, I completely fall for it was the 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:03.860
 first 5 in 1 of my life at the predator and 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:05.510
 in three years it had been for three years 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:07.370
 that I had eyes and it was my all 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:09.590
 first 50 years with atr and more 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:11.989
 especially my very first full 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:14.060
 team predator because you have to know 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:15.980
 that they were only 5 in front and that 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:18.350
 after a player will join anyway 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:20.700
 it was the first of my life so 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:21.930
 understand that I was rather happy 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.370
 I can do not yet account in 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.769
 did some gameplay that I was busy at 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:28.200
 to be good so far it was not it 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:29.870
 not technically exceptional at most 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.280
 high level of the score I was not yet 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:35.849
 extremely advanced but actually the thing 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:37.990
 it's that my allies and spas 

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:39.550
 gm batteries which allowed me to 

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:42.160
 to monopolize we will say the 

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:45.120
 illuminations and especially the enemies 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:47.890
 were really bad to stay nice 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:51.070
 and that's really what allowed me to 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:53.770
 wadi to do a good part then 

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:55.570
 it's not my best it's not my 

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:57.430
 best match but not flagship team at 

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:59.590
 level of the number of releases I 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:00.950
 already done 60 batch elimination 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:02.629
 banks 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:05.090
 and it was the series besides I 

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:07.640
 meet a little print screen there 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:11.300
 the screen for those who would think that I 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:13.640
 mens is but here it was the CFCT 

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:15.800
 not intervention so intervention 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:17.680
 it's the best match to death by 

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:21.009
 team that I did at the name level 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:24.880
 of elimination so that's saying 

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:26.949
 other beauvau the nation predator ariÃ© 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:28.639
 and can the water really is the trio 

00:04:26.949 --> 00:04:30.229
 folk winner at word 

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:31.610
 I do not know how to call it the little one 

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:35.449
 do very early bar it's still 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:38.689
 full and so that's good but what 

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:40.069
 strict fetish that's how 

00:04:38.689 --> 00:04:42.979
 past your entry me for now 

00:04:40.069 --> 00:04:44.509
 it's rather chill is not it so 

00:04:42.979 --> 00:04:48.150
 here is the purchase actually I am in the daytime 

00:04:44.509 --> 00:04:49.680
 pedagogical to move leave 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:51.060
 and then last week actually it was the 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:52.110
 back in yeah but I missed all three 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:53.670
 first days of school 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:54.900
 I had a gastro in fact ben 

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:56.100
 obviously stay all this is 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:58.170
 disgusting will kill two letters three 

00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:00.920
 first school days but I you 

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:03.030
 assure that it sucked me 

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:05.750
 I was really in the famous poo 

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:09.600
 dream he dies three little word games 

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:10.640
 awesome and so here it is but I hope 

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:12.510
 that everything went well 

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:14.400
 finally as I tell you to me for 

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:14.970
 the moment I sticky not bad about 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:16.470
 chain 

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:18.480
 I always have to duel 

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:20.700
 commentary in original quotation marks 

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:22.380
 which I hope you will like but for 

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:23.940
 the moment no one guessed the 

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:25.770
 person with whom i want to do it i 

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:27.510
 will do it and I first want that 

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:30.360
 someone living 

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:31.410
 before doing so so here I go 

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:33.510
 give you an extra clue 

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:35.340
 so remember the previous clues 

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:36.780
 this excellent is a man he does not 

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:38.220
 did not have to be a geek for college 

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:40.020
 since same name per year know him to 

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:43.110
 my opinion and we must not play games 

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:44.520
 video to know him a lot he is 

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:46.680
 very well known a lot of people the 

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:48.450
 know we can talk to him we can 

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:49.350
 not talk to him in real life we ââcan just him 

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:51.810
 talk on the phone 

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:54.240
 and I add an additional clue that 

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:57.120
 should all make you guess it 

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:59.340
 wi fi so here's a reminder of a wood of 

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:01.380
 this box for the one who guesses so here is 

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:03.750
 it will be the little challenge good then 

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:05.009
 the goal is no longer a common duel 

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:06.780
 original tackle 

00:06:05.009 --> 00:06:08.699
 I do not know it's going to be funny I know 

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:09.300
 it's not going to be fun I just wanted 

00:06:08.699 --> 00:06:11.340
 try 

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:12.599
 and I give you boxing or finally laugh 

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:13.979
 we'll see in any case I had 

00:06:12.599 --> 00:06:15.750
 really want to try 

00:06:13.979 --> 00:06:17.700
 I had this little idea 

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:19.710
 two weeks ago 

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:21.600
 so here I want to try I have a 

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:24.630
 other project about the chain but 

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:26.280
 it's a little more serious 

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:27.630
 is going to say so I'm going to tell you a 

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:29.640
 day when I will have a little more time 

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:31.560
 since the video is already finished 

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:33.300
 it was really a good bassac 

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:34.650
 you will have noticed a g edit the 

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:36.840
 color of gameplay I find they 

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:38.280
 are more enjoyable like that and you 

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:40.460
 you yourself said in the previous 

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:41.690
 video that you prefer when 

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:43.630
 like at home he watched all that 

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:46.320
 I miss it 

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:46.320
 a nice match 

00:06:46.349 --> 00:06:49.659
 and 

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:50.680
 I tell you something more you had some 

00:06:49.659 --> 00:06:52.060
 some colors you like so 

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:54.159
 now here I am going to put them to 

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:56.770
 each video yes I forgot to specify 

00:06:54.159 --> 00:06:59.500
 only on mac os 9 105 intervention forgiveness 

00:06:56.770 --> 00:07:00.759
 I did not target this lead so I put 

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:02.830
 commando because I had not yet 

00:07:00.759 --> 00:07:05.050
 unlocked report but rest assured I 

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:06.939
 do not use it I do not think I have 

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:08.830
 stabbed during 

00:07:06.939 --> 00:07:11.139
 the good match after that it's true that my 

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:12.759
 moreau bonus really well helped so the 

00:07:11.139 --> 00:07:14.319
 final score will not delay in his record and 

00:07:12.759 --> 00:07:16.300
 I'm still going to finish with a beautiful 

00:07:14.319 --> 00:07:18.069
 xk the story of a little catch up 

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:19.539
 technical level I come back I created 

00:07:18.069 --> 00:07:20.469
 with this word but it's really big 

00:07:19.539 --> 00:07:22.029
 lack of this gameplay 

00:07:20.469 --> 00:07:23.529
 I hope you will but this 

00:07:22.029 --> 00:07:25.599
 party did not hesitate to put a small 

00:07:23.529 --> 00:07:28.330
 green thumb is very important for my 

00:07:25.599 --> 00:07:29.620
 psychological state fans have frankly 

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:31.330
 it makes me happy I do not hide it 

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:33.340
 I hope you will but this video 

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:34.870
 I'm looking forward to meeting you for 

00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:36.550
 the next video so it will surely 

00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:36.939
 the dual commentary really needs that I 

00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:38.949
 do it 

00:07:36.939 --> 00:07:42.569
 good luck to find the name and I 

00:07:38.949 --> 00:07:42.569
 you say bye-bye hi goodbye
