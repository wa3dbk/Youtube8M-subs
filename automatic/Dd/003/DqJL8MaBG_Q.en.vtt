00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 Hello everyone today I bring you 5 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:06.390
 things that were not clear to me in the 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.490
 Oscar winning film in the 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.160
 animation category if I refer to 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.410
 disney frozen I must admit that I had 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.690
 many expectations when I heard of 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.220
 her in 2012 and the characters and their 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.680
 scenarios caught my attention 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.840
 but when I went to see her her dubbing in 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.460
 Spanish bored me and I fell asleep to 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.590
 half was not until I saw 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.970
 subtitled when I finally saw her 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.970
 complete and with much more attention 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:41.980
 number 5 because the parents of elsa 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:44.350
 they decide to close it in the castle as 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:46.420
 if it was an infection if the 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:48.430
 troll knew that love was the solution 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:50.710
 it would not have been easier for them to 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:55.050
 say instead of ruining childhood the 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:55.050
 girl what kind of parents are those 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:08.220
 number 4 because when he escapes from 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:11.250
 kingdom the guards allow anna to be 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.530
 who goes to look for the girl passed 13 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.540
 years locked in the castle perhaps 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.760
 between his classes of good manners and 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.130
 Sewing also received lessons from 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:22.530
 survival in the mountains without 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.900
 mention your good judgment until the serve 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.940
 she spent more time in seclusion than she knew 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:30.320
 that he should not trust strangers 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:30.320
 - marry them 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:43.470
 number 3 maybe this is one of my 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.570
 bigger doubts as the sã did for 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.390
 arrive in less than 5 minutes to the top 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.460
 of the mountain if we pay attention not 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.770
 much happens from the scene where we see 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.690
 elsa escape and the scene where Anna 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.270
 He decides to look for it and then start 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:59.520
 sing letting go to anaya christophe les 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.290
 It took a whole day to reach the top but 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.190
 apparently the sã had an elevator 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.190
 electric ice 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:17.370
 number 2 was really necessary the 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.020
 snowman know that many will say that 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:22.140
 it was he who took them to the castle of 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:24.360
 elsa but really really needed 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.069
 a guide to find the castle throws 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:29.930
 Charo mortal ties on top of the 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:29.930
 highest mountain in the damn place 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.599
 number 1 because suddenly the sã 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.519
 he understood everything that in 13 years 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:46.920
 had not been able in just a few 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:48.900
 seconds with just listening to the 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.939
 olaf words of love thaws 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:53.340
 seems to have learned the bible in 

00:02:50.939 --> 00:02:56.099
 a single sitting this has been all of my 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:58.409
 part until next time if the video will 

00:02:56.099 --> 00:03:01.909
