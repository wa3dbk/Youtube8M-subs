 let you out between 4 and 6 creps 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:13.950
 to need a little bit of cooked chard 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.950
 and sliced ham 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:21.250

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:23.530
 little bit of pepper I got you gado in 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:25.119
 just a little oil you know 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:28.390
 but we can use a little bit of 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:30.399
 Olive oil is good but you have to 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:32.860
 be very careful with this and also 

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:34.479
 our quick sauce of tomatoes that 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.950
 I am also leaving here the link 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:38.140
 so you can see how to do it and you can 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:40.720
 remember let's go now to put together 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.390
 directly the cross first we will do the 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:45.600
 filling 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:48.350
 we are going to put in a container we will put 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.350
 the cell 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.659
 the Swiss chard you have to try to 

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:56.450
 haberles removed the water if you find it 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:58.820
 left of cooking sometimes when the 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.950
 we keep that a little bit is lost a 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:03.229
 little bit of water after cooling down 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:06.619
 let's put a couple of tablespoons of the 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:08.899
 chopped onion and we will incorporate the 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:11.629
 Ham 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:14.269
 and those are all the ingredients like 

00:02:11.629 --> 00:02:17.360
 I have already added salt to the cooking of 

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:19.190
 Swiss chard and also onion 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:22.670
 I go 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:26.720
 to put nothing else if you want you can 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:30.710
 use a better egg or a clear one to 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:33.260
 flirt a little bit what is the filling 

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:35.090
 but also as you see if there is not 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.600
 well I mention this because 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:40.210
 often used 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:41.860
 an egg to link well all the 

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:43.300
 fillings ingredients if you 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:45.420
 You can do so many want that 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:49.390
 we are allowed to use clear at will 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:52.050
 so now let's take one of 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:54.680
 our crepes 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:54.680
 and let's go 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:00.440
 We put enough of 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.440
 filling 

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:08.050
 and we're just going to go 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:10.520
 way 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:12.350
 we are going to 

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:14.710
 and then we're going to put on this 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:14.710
 plate 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:22.629
 very good then now what we have 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:26.349
 what to do is directly we are going to put 

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:28.629
 a little bit of the sauce above and what 

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:32.190
 let's take a few minutes of oven 

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:32.190
 so that it's free 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:38.540
 the sauce you can put the amount that 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:38.540
 you like it 

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:44.260
 as I was saying is a different recipe 

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:52.510
 We take to the oven and ready to eat
