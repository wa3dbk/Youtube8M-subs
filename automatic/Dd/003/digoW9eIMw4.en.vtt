let's<00:00:00.659> do<00:00:00.810> a<00:00:00.840> mental<00:00:01.260> math<00:00:01.410> test<00:00:01.770> is<00:00:02.030> the

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:03.030 
let's do a mental math test is the

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.019 
let's do a mental math test is the
number<00:00:03.740> 613<00:00:04.740> thousand<00:00:05.310> two<00:00:05.609> hundred<00:00:05.640> and

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
pressure Locker in this video I'll teach

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:16.790 
pressure Locker in this video I'll teach
you<00:00:14.940> a<00:00:14.969> math<00:00:15.389> trick<00:00:15.750> where<00:00:16.230> you<00:00:16.379> can<00:00:16.529> test

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
you a math trick where you can test

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.370 
you a math trick where you can test
divisibility<00:00:17.760> by<00:00:18.150> 11<00:00:18.630> in<00:00:18.779> your<00:00:19.140> head<00:00:21.380> here's

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
divisibility by 11 in your head here's

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.630 
divisibility by 11 in your head here's
the<00:00:22.590> trick<00:00:23.900> starting<00:00:24.900> from<00:00:25.380> the<00:00:25.800> first<00:00:26.070> digit

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
the trick starting from the first digit

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.570 
the trick starting from the first digit
on<00:00:26.760> the<00:00:27.029> left<00:00:27.269> you<00:00:27.930> want<00:00:28.109> to<00:00:28.349> subtract<00:00:28.920> and<00:00:29.250> add

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
on the left you want to subtract and add

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.190 
on the left you want to subtract and add
every<00:00:30.390> other<00:00:30.599> digit<00:00:31.320> in<00:00:31.439> the<00:00:31.619> number<00:00:33.200> the

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
every other digit in the number the

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.880 
every other digit in the number the
first<00:00:34.440> digit<00:00:34.920> is<00:00:35.070> 6<00:00:35.690> so<00:00:36.690> we<00:00:36.840> will<00:00:36.989> subtract<00:00:37.530> the

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
first digit is 6 so we will subtract the

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.889 
first digit is 6 so we will subtract the
next<00:00:38.250> digit<00:00:38.550> of<00:00:38.670> 1<00:00:39.030> add<00:00:39.620> the<00:00:40.620> next<00:00:40.829> digit<00:00:41.160> 3

00:00:41.889 --> 00:00:41.899 
next digit of 1 add the next digit 3

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:46.400 
next digit of 1 add the next digit 3
subtract<00:00:42.899> the<00:00:43.079> next<00:00:43.410> digit<00:00:43.739> 2<00:00:44.539> then<00:00:45.539> add<00:00:45.840> 6<00:00:46.170> and

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
subtract the next digit 2 then add 6 and

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.319 
subtract the next digit 2 then add 6 and
finally<00:00:47.280> subtract<00:00:47.910> 1<00:00:49.670> this<00:00:50.670> is<00:00:50.879> an<00:00:51.000> easy

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
finally subtract 1 this is an easy

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.900 
finally subtract 1 this is an easy
calculation<00:00:51.690> to<00:00:52.230> perform<00:00:52.680> and<00:00:52.890> we<00:00:53.579> get<00:00:53.760> the

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
calculation to perform and we get the

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.310 
calculation to perform and we get the
answer<00:00:54.059> of<00:00:54.329> 11<00:00:55.190> if<00:00:56.210> the<00:00:57.210> result<00:00:57.629> from<00:00:58.079> this

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
answer of 11 if the result from this

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.279 
answer of 11 if the result from this
alternating<00:00:58.920> sum<00:00:59.280> is<00:00:59.460> divisible<00:00:59.760> by<00:01:00.120> 11<00:01:00.300> then

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
alternating sum is divisible by 11 then

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.490 
alternating sum is divisible by 11 then
the<00:01:01.500> original<00:01:01.739> number<00:01:02.309> is<00:01:02.340> as<00:01:02.730> well<00:01:03.030> so<00:01:03.870> 11<00:01:04.350> is

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
the original number is as well so 11 is

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:05.750 
the original number is as well so 11 is
divisible<00:01:04.860> by<00:01:05.040> 11

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
divisible by 11

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.340 
divisible by 11
so<00:01:05.970> we<00:01:06.119> know<00:01:06.270> the<00:01:06.450> original<00:01:06.900> number<00:01:07.229> is

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
so we know the original number is

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.399 
so we know the original number is
divisible<00:01:07.439> by<00:01:08.250> 11

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:12.409 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:15.140 

let's<00:01:13.409> use<00:01:13.680> this<00:01:13.830> trick<00:01:14.100> to<00:01:14.610> do<00:01:14.729> a<00:01:14.760> couple<00:01:15.119> of

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
let's use this trick to do a couple of

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:15.920 
let's use this trick to do a couple of
examples

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
examples

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.440 
examples
let's<00:01:16.590> do<00:01:16.830> fifteen<00:01:17.580> thousand<00:01:18.090> two<00:01:18.420> hundred

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
let's do fifteen thousand two hundred

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.980 
let's do fifteen thousand two hundred
and<00:01:18.960> thirty<00:01:19.290> seven<00:01:19.619> in<00:01:20.450> our<00:01:21.450> heads<00:01:21.750> we

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
and thirty seven in our heads we

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:27.020 
and thirty seven in our heads we
calculate<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:22.799> alternating<00:01:23.520> sum<00:01:23.939> is<00:01:24.150> two<00:01:26.030> two

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
calculate the alternating sum is two two

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.499 
calculate the alternating sum is two two
is<00:01:27.330> not<00:01:27.750> divisible<00:01:28.200> by<00:01:28.439> 11<00:01:28.619> so<00:01:29.220> we<00:01:29.850> know<00:01:30.060> the

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
is not divisible by 11 so we know the

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.179 
is not divisible by 11 so we know the
original<00:01:31.020> number<00:01:31.290> is<00:01:31.439> not<00:01:31.860> divisible<00:01:31.890> by<00:01:32.640> 11

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:34.189 
original number is not divisible by 11

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:36.770 
original number is not divisible by 11
let's<00:01:35.189> do<00:01:35.430> one<00:01:35.700> one<00:01:35.909> two<00:01:36.150> two<00:01:36.180> three<00:01:36.390> three

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
let's do one one two two three three

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.609 
let's do one one two two three three
four<00:01:37.200> four

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:39.619 
four four

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:42.649 
four four
we<00:01:40.619> could<00:01:40.890> take<00:01:41.070> the<00:01:41.220> alternating<00:01:41.729> sum<00:01:42.000> but<00:01:42.509> we

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
we could take the alternating sum but we

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.109 
we could take the alternating sum but we
can<00:01:42.840> easily<00:01:43.140> see<00:01:43.530> every<00:01:43.979> other<00:01:44.009> digit<00:01:44.460> cancels

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
can easily see every other digit cancels

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.710 
can easily see every other digit cancels
out<00:01:45.270> the<00:01:45.509> digit<00:01:45.840> before<00:01:46.460> so<00:01:47.460> we<00:01:47.670> know<00:01:47.700> zero<00:01:48.600> is

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
out the digit before so we know zero is

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:49.340 
out the digit before so we know zero is
the<00:01:48.869> result

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
the result

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.980 
the result
zero<00:01:50.100> is<00:01:50.220> divisible<00:01:50.520> by<00:01:50.700> 11<00:01:51.240> so<00:01:51.450> the<00:01:51.630> original

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
zero is divisible by 11 so the original

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.980 
zero is divisible by 11 so the original
number<00:01:52.290> is<00:01:52.320> also<00:01:52.799> divisible<00:01:53.100> by<00:01:53.369> 11<00:01:53.780> it's<00:01:54.780> a

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
number is also divisible by 11 it's a

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.139 
number is also divisible by 11 it's a
really<00:01:55.290> cool<00:01:55.470> trick<00:01:55.829> you<00:01:56.369> can<00:01:56.610> figure<00:01:56.969> out

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
really cool trick you can figure out

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.990 
really cool trick you can figure out
whether<00:01:57.420> a<00:01:57.570> number<00:01:57.810> is<00:01:57.990> divisible<00:01:58.560> by<00:01:58.829> 11<00:01:59.009> by

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
whether a number is divisible by 11 by

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.300 
whether a number is divisible by 11 by
performing<00:02:00.630> a<00:02:00.719> simple<00:02:00.799> calculation<00:02:01.799> in<00:02:02.130> your
