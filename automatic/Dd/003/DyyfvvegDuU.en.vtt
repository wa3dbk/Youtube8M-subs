00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.080 
same thing the sides were a little bit
cumbersome<00:01:04.680> just<00:01:05.040> because<00:01:05.280> either<00:01:05.430> so<00:01:05.729> thin

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
cumbersome just because either so thin

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.270 
cumbersome just because either so thin
that<00:01:06.630> they<00:01:06.750> tend<00:01:07.049> to<00:01:07.140> shake<00:01:07.560> around<00:01:07.920> a<00:01:08.070> lot<00:01:08.250> so

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
that they tend to shake around a lot so

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.340 
that they tend to shake around a lot so
to<00:01:08.549> align<00:01:09.000> it<00:01:09.180> was<00:01:09.360> just<00:01:09.540> a<00:01:09.659> little<00:01:09.810> bit<00:01:10.020> tough

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
to align it was just a little bit tough

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.969 
to align it was just a little bit tough
but<00:01:11.220> I<00:01:11.310> think<00:01:11.490> I<00:01:11.549> did<00:01:11.610> a<00:01:11.700> pretty<00:01:11.939> good<00:01:12.119> job<00:01:12.979> now

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
but I think I did a pretty good job now

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.410 
but I think I did a pretty good job now
this<00:01:14.130> won't<00:01:14.280> impede<00:01:14.549> the<00:01:14.670> usage<00:01:15.000> of<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.210> phone

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
this won't impede the usage of the phone

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:16.940 
this won't impede the usage of the phone
at<00:01:15.570> all<00:01:15.659> so<00:01:15.930> one<00:01:16.080> thing<00:01:16.259> I<00:01:16.320> like<00:01:16.350> to<00:01:16.590> know<00:01:16.740> is

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
you can remove the back cover very

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.380 
you can remove the back cover very
easily<00:01:19.380> just<00:01:22.670> pull<00:01:23.670> it<00:01:23.790> out<00:01:23.909> and<00:01:24.060> as<00:01:24.180> you<00:01:24.299> can
