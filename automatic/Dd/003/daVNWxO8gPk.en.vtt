the<00:00:07.440> moving<00:00:07.710> axis<00:00:08.309> aircraft<00:00:08.880> simulator<00:00:09.450> was

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
the moving axis aircraft simulator was

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.980 
the moving axis aircraft simulator was
finished<00:00:10.320> in<00:00:10.440> October<00:00:10.920> of<00:00:11.010> 2008<00:00:11.820> this<00:00:12.780> was<00:00:12.960> a

well done we had a rollout party people
got<00:00:37.739> to<00:00:37.860> try<00:00:38.070> the<00:00:38.129> simulator<00:00:38.670> and<00:00:39.120> they<00:00:39.300> had

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
got to try the simulator and they had

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.150 
got to try the simulator and they had
fun<00:00:40.309> but<00:00:41.309> I<00:00:41.370> wasn't<00:00:41.700> satisfied<00:00:42.480> with<00:00:42.510> it<00:00:42.719> I

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:43.160 
fun but I wasn't satisfied with it I

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:46.279 
fun but I wasn't satisfied with it I
knew<00:00:44.160> that<00:00:44.190> I<00:00:44.489> could<00:00:44.700> build<00:00:44.910> a<00:00:45.090> better<00:00:45.420> motion

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289

knew that I could build a better motion
flight<00:00:46.530> simulator<00:00:47.129> and<00:00:47.730> I<00:00:47.910> wanted<00:00:48.210> to<00:00:48.300> start

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
flight simulator and I wanted to start

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.729

to<00:01:28.860> air<00:01:29.220> shows<00:01:29.610> but<00:01:30.240> I<00:01:30.420> took<00:01:30.479> too<00:01:30.900> long<00:01:30.930> to

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
to air shows but I took too long to

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.420 
to air shows but I took too long to
build<00:01:32.130> it<00:01:32.369> and<00:01:32.610> missed<00:01:33.420> the<00:01:33.630> entire<00:01:34.430> 2008

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430

as<00:01:37.710> it<00:01:38.100> turns<00:01:38.340> out<00:01:38.550> we<00:01:38.850> couldn't<00:01:39.150> have<00:01:39.240> made

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
as it turns out we couldn't have made

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.350 
as it turns out we couldn't have made
much<00:01:39.660> money<00:01:39.900> with<00:01:40.170> it<00:01:40.290> anyway<00:01:41.180> expenses<00:01:42.180> would

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
much money with it anyway expenses would

much money with it anyway expenses would
have<00:01:42.480> been<00:01:42.600> hired<00:01:42.840> because<00:01:43.730> we<00:01:44.730> would<00:01:44.940> have

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
have been hired because we would have

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.240 
have been hired because we would have

now<00:01:50.250> I'll<00:01:50.700> tell<00:01:50.940> you<00:01:51.120> about<00:01:51.270> the<00:01:51.570> end<00:01:51.780> of<00:01:52.230> the

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
now I'll tell you about the end of the

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.540 
now I'll tell you about the end of the
max<00:01:52.860> project<00:01:53.730> I<00:01:54.560> needed<00:01:55.560> a<00:01:55.620> place<00:01:55.890> to<00:01:55.950> store

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:56.550

the<00:01:57.150> simulator<00:01:57.720> for<00:01:58.110> the<00:01:58.290> winter<00:01:58.620> it<00:01:59.040> couldn't

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
the simulator for the winter it couldn't

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.590 
the simulator for the winter it couldn't
stay<00:01:59.730> in<00:02:00.120> my<00:02:00.480> garage<00:02:00.860> so<00:02:01.860> I<00:02:02.310> asked<00:02:02.790> around<00:02:02.880> to

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
stay in my garage so I asked around to

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.240 
stay in my garage so I asked around to
see<00:02:03.810> if<00:02:03.930> there<00:02:04.110> is<00:02:04.140> a<00:02:04.260> place<00:02:04.590> I<00:02:04.800> could<00:02:04.860> store<00:02:05.220> it

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
see if there is a place I could store it

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.020 
see if there is a place I could store it
for<00:02:05.520> free<00:02:06.080> but<00:02:07.080> everyone<00:02:07.710> was<00:02:07.890> freaking<00:02:08.880> out

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
for free but everyone was freaking out

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.180 
for free but everyone was freaking out
about<00:02:09.060> the<00:02:09.869> recession<00:02:10.560> and<00:02:10.709> they<00:02:10.830> weren't<00:02:11.010> in

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
about the recession and they weren't in

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:16.300 
about the recession and they weren't in
the<00:02:11.280> mood<00:02:11.340> to<00:02:11.610> talk<00:02:11.790> about<00:02:12.000> free<00:02:12.690> stuff<00:02:13.220> so<00:02:14.220> I

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
the mood to talk about free stuff so I

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.520 
the mood to talk about free stuff so I
partially<00:02:17.390> disassembled<00:02:18.390> the<00:02:18.600> simulator<00:02:19.410> I

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
partially disassembled the simulator I

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.850 
partially disassembled the simulator I
took<00:02:19.680> the<00:02:20.040> fuselage<00:02:20.580> off<00:02:20.940> of<00:02:21.150> the<00:02:21.300> base<00:02:21.570> and<00:02:22.020> my

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
took the fuselage off of the base and my

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.520 
took the fuselage off of the base and my
idea<00:02:23.250> was<00:02:23.520> to<00:02:23.670> prop<00:02:24.000> up<00:02:24.030> the<00:02:24.390> fuselage<00:02:24.959> against

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
idea was to prop up the fuselage against

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
idea was to prop up the fuselage against
the<00:02:25.740> wall<00:02:25.980> of<00:02:26.520> the<00:02:26.760> garage<00:02:27.680> at<00:02:28.680> one<00:02:28.920> point<00:02:29.190> I

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
the wall of the garage at one point I

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:33.590 
the wall of the garage at one point I
lift<00:02:30.420> it<00:02:30.600> up<00:02:30.720> on<00:02:30.959> part<00:02:31.860> of<00:02:31.950> the<00:02:32.040> nose<00:02:32.540> that<00:02:33.540> I

lift it up on part of the nose that I

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.740 
lift it up on part of the nose that I

important purpose by working on this
simulator<00:03:09.930> I<00:03:10.230> got<00:03:10.860> the<00:03:11.040> idea<00:03:11.430> for<00:03:11.880> a<00:03:11.940> much

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
simulator I got the idea for a much

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:15.680 
simulator I got the idea for a much
better<00:03:12.709> motion<00:03:13.709> flight<00:03:14.010> simulator<00:03:14.550> as<00:03:14.820> it's

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
better motion flight simulator as it's

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:18.020 
better motion flight simulator as it's
happened<00:03:16.050> so<00:03:16.230> many<00:03:16.290> times<00:03:16.470> before<00:03:16.920> I<00:03:17.489> had<00:03:17.910> to

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
happened so many times before I had to

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:21.080 
happened so many times before I had to
work<00:03:18.180> on<00:03:18.360> the<00:03:18.480> mediocre<00:03:18.930> idea<00:03:19.500> before<00:03:20.489> the

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
work on the mediocre idea before the

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:24.610 
work on the mediocre idea before the
great<00:03:21.450> idea<00:03:21.900> would<00:03:22.260> reveal<00:03:22.799> itself

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:24.620 
great idea would reveal itself

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:28.460 
great idea would reveal itself
everything<00:03:25.620> I<00:03:25.920> don't<00:03:26.730> like<00:03:27.030> about<00:03:27.269> the<00:03:27.840> max<00:03:28.110> i

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
everything I don't like about the max i

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:31.039 
everything I don't like about the max i
can<00:03:28.890> fix<00:03:29.160> by<00:03:30.000> building<00:03:30.450> a<00:03:30.540> new<00:03:30.720> flight

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:31.049 
can fix by building a new flight

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:35.150 
can fix by building a new flight
simulator<00:03:31.820> but<00:03:32.820> that<00:03:33.720> takes<00:03:34.500> me<00:03:34.769> to<00:03:34.890> the<00:03:35.010> end

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160
