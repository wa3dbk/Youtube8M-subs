 Competition at the moment becomes busy 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.250

 huge chaos sykes you cool 

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:46.250
 okay, we 've had sleepless months 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:48.410
 I'm 15, that's it 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:51.320
 Coffee maker that's what I thought 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:55.340
 It's not good for bouldering for me 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:56.059
 the day only with a good coffee 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:59.379
 boat 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:59.379
 now we are done 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:07.789
 I believe that a little bit too 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:09.499
 they all still have to do that now 

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:11.840
 Most of them also arrive 

00:01:09.499 --> 00:01:13.789
 the wall we reinforcements with martin 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.719
 and josef warriors the things still 

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:16.490
 they were never easy 

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:20.170
 screw it on and off for it or 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:28.219
 not quite so sexy my wall 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:29.329
 I also take it with you have one 

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:31.310
 grabbed the wall 

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:32.750
 the well screwed white brother 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.939
 it is far from that if we have the 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:38.360
 Citizen building we pay attention to a lot 

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:40.069
 things for example that we the 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.780
 handles are set in one color 

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:43.129
 ie there can be many things 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:45.459
 go to the professional kas is 

00:01:43.129 --> 00:01:47.420
 So explain 

00:01:45.459 --> 00:01:52.489
 This looks more like climbing Eisner 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:54.890
 we just wanted to screw you out 

00:01:52.489 --> 00:01:56.030
 ask what are you screwing 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:58.909
 just for such a right match 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:01.399
 tomorrow we'll take care of it 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:03.229
 first 80 first okay what you can achieve 

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:05.569
 want to select at the competition 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:07.640
 Okay, so of course, the best has to be 

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:10.099
 but of course wins the 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.670
 weakest part also have fun listening to the 

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:12.230
 case 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:13.549
 It should look good a good one 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:16.340
 mood in stables is a bit 

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:18.440
 action you have here now 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.720
 screwed the red or the exact one 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.459
 the rodenhof is trying somehow 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.799
 watched if that fits and I have 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:26.870
 screwed this green yellow exactly 

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:28.010
 definitely looks so hard for 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:30.470
 me how does it work 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:32.690
 So yes, the idea was so there 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.980
 can approach have different 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:35.750
 to be inspired by the wall 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.060
 you have handles that inspire you or 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:39.829
 I had an idea with the brother now 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:41.900
 just the idea okay I want 

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:43.790
 somehow run into the Bahrain and there 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:46.849
 I would like to have a great handle on 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:48.650
 The next time he pulls just that, that's just right 

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:50.510
 a from over there over there but 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:52.819
 if you screw them you have to do the same 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:56.889
 also create or you should open it 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:56.889
 every case unsuccessfully killed 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.310
 Hope we could give you a little something 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:02.569
 show the ipad of the good coffee like us 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:05.000
 here our good screws 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:06.080
 how you see the dark circles do not come 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.879
 We also have the night by about 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.739
 in front of us you still have much to do 

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:11.930
 so throw yourself out of here now 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:13.909
 if he suggestions to the next 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:15.440
 have programs or themes that we 

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:17.390
 maybe where few can look after 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:19.280
 can travel whom we can meet what 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:20.810
 we could just show it 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.290
 post below in the comments by then 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:23.290
