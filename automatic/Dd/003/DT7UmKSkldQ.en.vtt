00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650

golf or ping-pong or anything else it's

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.850 
golf or ping-pong or anything else it's
about<00:01:26.100> practice<00:01:26.700> just<00:01:26.880> like<00:01:26.939> videotaping<00:01:27.860> you

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
about practice just like videotaping you

about practice just like videotaping you
gotta<00:01:29.100> practice<00:01:29.369> but<00:01:30.240> I<00:01:30.270> think<00:01:30.509> the<00:01:30.600> most

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
gotta practice but I think the most

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.480 
gotta practice but I think the most
important<00:01:31.200> thing<00:01:31.320> is<00:01:31.439> you<00:01:31.530> gotta<00:01:31.770> make<00:01:32.340> the

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
important thing is you gotta make the

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.480 
important thing is you gotta make the
decision<00:01:32.970> yourself<00:01:33.090> and<00:01:33.630> if<00:01:34.320> you<00:01:34.439> really<00:01:35.250> like

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
decision yourself and if you really like

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.760 
decision yourself and if you really like
something<00:01:35.759> you<00:01:36.329> do<00:01:36.570> the<00:01:36.869> very<00:01:37.079> best<00:01:37.290> you<00:01:37.500> can

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
something you do the very best you can

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.980 
something you do the very best you can
but<00:01:38.189> you<00:01:38.280> don't<00:01:38.460> have<00:01:38.549> to<00:01:38.700> follow<00:01:39.509> the<00:01:39.750> norm

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
but you don't have to follow the norm

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.740 
but you don't have to follow the norm
and<00:01:40.380> just<00:01:40.890> follow<00:01:41.159> your<00:01:41.340> instinct<00:01:41.850> the<00:01:42.509> favor
