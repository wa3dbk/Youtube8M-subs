turns badly and terrorist now II do it
situation<00:00:28.890> that<00:00:29.070> this<00:00:29.220> engine<00:00:29.700> is<00:00:29.910> very<00:00:30.210> cold

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:30.600 
situation that this engine is very cold

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:34.729 
situation that this engine is very cold
and<00:00:30.930> it<00:00:31.590> has<00:00:31.830> been<00:00:32.160> in<00:00:32.850> bad<00:00:33.600> condition<00:00:34.440> many

and it has been in bad condition many
weeks<00:00:35.129> and<00:00:35.489> that<00:00:35.850> we<00:00:36.120> need<00:00:36.449> to<00:00:36.690> give<00:00:36.989> revs<00:00:37.530> and

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:38.480 
weeks and that we need to give revs and

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.960 
weeks and that we need to give revs and
let's<00:00:39.480> look<00:00:39.750> the<00:00:40.199> result<00:00:40.559> how<00:00:40.830> this<00:00:41.640> called

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:41.970 
let's look the result how this called

00:00:41.970 --> 00:01:40.760 
let's look the result how this called
engine<00:00:42.690> runs

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:47.870 

triplicate

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.830 

check<00:01:48.360> the<00:01:48.570> footage

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:52.840 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.069 

okay<00:01:53.799> and<00:01:54.130> what<00:01:54.340> helps<00:01:54.820> that<00:01:55.149> kind<00:01:55.420> of<00:01:55.540> Easter

00:01:56.069 --> 00:01:56.079 
okay and what helps that kind of Easter

00:01:56.079 --> 00:02:00.060 
okay and what helps that kind of Easter
is<00:01:56.829> this<00:01:57.250> revs<00:01:57.670> this<00:01:58.299> engine<00:01:58.899> needs<00:01:59.259> a<00:01:59.680> lot<00:01:59.829> of

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:00.070 
is this revs this engine needs a lot of

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:03.690 
is this revs this engine needs a lot of
revs<00:02:00.430> and<00:02:00.909> that<00:02:01.600> that<00:02:01.960> it<00:02:02.200> it<00:02:02.439> becomes<00:02:02.920> hot<00:02:03.310> and

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:03.700 
revs and that that it it becomes hot and

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.969 
revs and that that it it becomes hot and
next<00:02:04.060> I<00:02:04.210> will<00:02:04.270> show<00:02:04.420> that<00:02:04.840> how<00:02:05.320> it<00:02:05.560> happens

next I will show that how it happens

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:17.220 
next I will show that how it happens
let's<00:02:06.369> look<00:02:06.640> and<00:02:07.000> enjoy

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:21.300 

this<00:02:17.980> would<00:02:18.190> look<00:02:18.370> like<00:02:18.640> something<00:02:19.120> like<00:02:20.310> 4007

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
this would look like something like 4007

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.720 
this would look like something like 4007
