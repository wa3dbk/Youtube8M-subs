00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.860
 Translated by the CG Portal website: http://kg-portal.ru/ 

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:10.440
 From the studio that gave you Snow White ... 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:11.460
 "Fantasy" ... 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.920
 And "History of menstruation." 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.340
 A fairy tale that was filmed again ... 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:18.280
 And again… 

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:19.220
 And again… 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:20.640
 And again… 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:21.880
 And again… 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:23.260
 And again… 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:24.480
 And again… 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:25.740
 And again… 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.240
 And again in cinemas! 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:30.800
 "Cinderella". 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:33.640
 Reconsider the classics of animation ... 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.800
 Which would nullify all thoughts of equality, 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.400
 Who taught your daughter "Cold Heart". 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.400
 Sewing is for women! 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:41.900
 There girls are taught to obey. 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.380
 Do all the housework. 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:45.220
 And explain that all problems can be solved 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:47.300
 If they are beautiful enough to grab a rich hubby. 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.900
 Enjoy the Cinderella story: 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.560
 orphans who are in slavery by the adoptive family. 

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:56.260
 She is either a powerful druid, and can communicate with animals ... 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:57.520
 He fell into the trap! Trapped! 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:59.340
 Where? In a trap ?! 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.500
 Either after years in prison ... 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:02.940
 And sewing sweaters for mice ... 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.800
 They slowly slid off the coils. 

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:06.640
 Yes, I know that the morning is beautiful. 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.000
 But the dream was no less remarkable. 

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:11.800
 Yeah, definitely gone crazy. 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.780
 But that will change when she meets her fairy godmother. 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.200
 Guardian angel, who for many years and did not think to somehow improve the life of Cinderella. 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.600
 But you could help her when her parents died ... 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.080
 Or at least when the foster family made a slave out of a girl. 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:26.700
 Thanks for the dress, lady, 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.120
 But it would be much more useful if you decided to take a snap-snap into the society for the protection of children's rights. 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:31.640
 About eight years ago. 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.660
 And let the name of Cinderella in the title of the film ... 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.300
 You are more than half the film will look at how the cat ... 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.120
 Trying to cope with an army of pests ... 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:41.780
 Captured every corner of the house. 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:45.260
 And for all these valid attempts to deal with a horde of pests ... 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.460
 His unstuck from the window. 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.620
 Soak up the age-old love story ... 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:54.620
 In which the prince broke to look for a future wife. 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:56.860
 And the king so desperately needs grandchildren ... 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:00.420
 What he does not care whose womb his son uses as a child-bearing factory. 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:03.040
 Be it a poor maid, chatting with mice, 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:05.140
 Or anyone with the same shoe size. 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:07.820
 But this little shoe can fit a lot of girls! 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:08.880
 This is his problem. 

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:09.540
 Oh, don't care. 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.680
 So go back to the times simpler ... 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.360
 And get ready to sing along to classic songs that you have loved since childhood. 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.500
 For example, a song that inspires false hopes. 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:24.440
 But my song is snag. 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.480
 Dreams do not come true - the majority. 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:34.720
 But I am a rare exception. 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:40.640
 Slender and beautiful, sweet. 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.680
 Or a cute mouse song. 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.600
 The mice here are smart as humans. 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.240
 Soak in a dream you can. 

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:48.240
 Tell who you want? 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.180
 You do not believe! 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.000
 And scissors are subservient to us! 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.700
 It is necessary - take out the insides. 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.700
 Ile's eyes pierce with a needle. 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:57.320
 Just like in the Middle Ages! 

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:00.580
 So do not climb on mice with human consciousness! 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.840
 Or Oscar-nominated song rubbish. 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:06.280
 Blurpi and blurp, but a tinkering turf ... 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.280
 And blibidi blabidi blynk! 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.000
 Rhyming is easier by inventing words. 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.220
 Zipiti note. 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:13.300
 Flipiti flapiti…. 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:15.140
 Obviously because the author booze. 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:18.080
 Starring 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:19.900
 Not saying that she thinks only about money ... 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.900
 Dracula Bram Stoker 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:23.680
 Kardashians 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.120
 Wilford Brimley 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:26.620
 Prince Fetishist 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:27.980
 Rosie odonnell 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:29.620
 Honest mouse 

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:34.360
 And Unbelievable expectations from relationships that girls pull into adulthood 

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:36.440
 "Drayara Beauty" 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:40.840
 I know the stepmother was not a gift. 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:42.540
 But now try to get along with in-law 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:45.200
 If anything goes wrong ...
