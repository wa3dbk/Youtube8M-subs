00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
macarons it doesn't go right to the edge

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:00.529 
macarons it doesn't go right to the edge
because<00:00:59.520> when<00:00:59.699> you<00:00:59.789> sandwich<00:01:00.180> the<00:01:00.359> two

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
because when you sandwich the two

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.510 
because when you sandwich the two
together<00:01:00.719> the<00:01:01.140> filling<00:01:01.920> will<00:01:02.070> end<00:01:02.370> up

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
together the filling will end up

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.870 
together the filling will end up
pressing<00:01:03.120> out<00:01:03.420> to<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:03.690> edges<00:01:04.580> by<00:01:05.580> itself

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
pressing out to the edges by itself

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.890 
pressing out to the edges by itself
quite<00:01:06.479> naturally<00:01:08.330> so<00:01:09.330> what<00:01:09.510> we're<00:01:09.600> gonna<00:01:09.659> do

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
quite naturally so what we're gonna do

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.600 
quite naturally so what we're gonna do
now<00:01:10.049> is<00:01:10.200> cut<00:01:10.590> a<00:01:10.619> little<00:01:10.830> hole<00:01:10.920> on<00:01:11.220> the<00:01:11.310> side<00:01:11.460> of

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
now is cut a little hole on the side of

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.390 
now is cut a little hole on the side of
the<00:01:11.700> bag<00:01:11.939> of<00:01:12.450> the<00:01:12.600> lemon<00:01:12.869> curd<00:01:13.049> and<00:01:14.010> then<00:01:14.100> pipe

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
the bag of the lemon curd and then pipe

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.249 
the bag of the lemon curd and then pipe
the<00:01:14.580> lemon<00:01:14.850> curd<00:01:15.000> directly<00:01:15.570> into<00:01:15.750> the<00:01:15.840> center

of<00:01:16.409> the<00:01:17.189> macaron<00:01:17.640> shell<00:01:18.650> so<00:01:19.650> this<00:01:19.799> is<00:01:19.920> like<00:01:20.100> a

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
of the macaron shell so this is like a

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.740 
of the macaron shell so this is like a
little<00:01:20.400> surprise<00:01:20.580> when<00:01:21.060> you<00:01:21.090> bite<00:01:21.360> into<00:01:21.570> the
