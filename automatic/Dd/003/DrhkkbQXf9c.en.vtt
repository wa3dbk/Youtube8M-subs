00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:11.250
 save all of spaces I am doctor 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.170
 white we are that today with a new video 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.179
 dedicated to subject faculty 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.470
 finally my tutorial on 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.970
 Trade 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.609
 I started doing the last few days 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.230
 buying and selling following an English method 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.760
 which I found on the three card forum 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.109
 I must say that it works 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.820
 I will leave the link in description for 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.189
 have all the further details 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.590
 a small premise, however, before 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:34.860
 start talking about this method not 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.510
 is suitable for those with little patience it 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.790
 will take a lot of patience to do this 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.469
 method and who maybe has so much time 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.510
 to devote to buying and selling then if 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.800
 you have many hours 3 4 hours a 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.050
 this day is not really suitable for this 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.520
 method because it is in the long run that 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.469
 rewards immediately is not 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.110
 very effective there are other methods that 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.760
 unfortunately I do not know because I do not 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.379
 I am never interested in these methods 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.420
 so this is a more method for those who have 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.820
 little time to play and has little time 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.789
 for the sale and has a lot of patience 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.470
 the method is based on the infor values 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.390
 funds that are those with the price of 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.430
 one can easily deduce why of 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.290
 they usually always use after the first 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.780
 week to stay in packages e 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.299
 takes advantage of the buy now and TV buyers 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.610
 lazy enough to look for the price 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:20.400
 better to make good money 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.350
 remember maybe you see the occasionally 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.850
 buy now higher than people buy 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.650
 immediately with the re-cards despite there 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.240
 be some lower this well 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.939
 method up by just those people there who 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.640
 do not check prices before buying 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:35.130
 what needs to be done you have to take a 7 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.619
 8 cards of the same player in this 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.329
 case I tried johnson with i 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:42.329
 style with maicon we try to 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:44.700
 inflating the price of the player to 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:47.850
 for example these johnson's got them all 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:50.970
 under 10.500 credits and I managed to 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.799
 sell them all between 14 thousand 750 and 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.409
 15,000 customers also in the same 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:57.030
 week in which they were then for sale 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:59.250
 you can still find them in the packages 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.799
 I still managed to see 15,000 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.719
 when you buy now they were only 12,000 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:05.680
 credits so it takes advantage of this 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:08.440
 great of the players that maybe 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:10.000
 a series of seven eight players all 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.160
 with the same prices they say well with the 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.200
 price of the player and that then it 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.690
 I buy and spend the buy now 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.880
 this is a fairly obvious method 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:21.010
 is based a little on the fortune of 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:23.890
 however, keep in mind that 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:25.930
 players under 10 thousand creditors yes 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.640
 they take under 11,000 10,000 credits 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.620
 you can't go to loss then up 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.410
 those players there always succeed 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:34.180
 to earn even on kakÃ  e 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:36.520
 michael nyman I'm doing with him 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.440
 along with English players Kaka 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:41.020
 I had taken it on the 38 thousand credits not 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.730
 resold 60,000 the same as yes 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:45.100
 he was under 30 thousand beliefs 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:46.480
 managed to sell it to 59 thousand this 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:48.310
 why because together with the other English 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:51.880
 and those people you find on the forum 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:53.230
 of three cards we decide together of 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:56.080
 inflating the price of this 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:58.690
 player to make it raise its value 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:59.830
 we did michael and matris meno 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:01.180
 last now we are starting to 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:03.070
 resell I am trying to resell 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:05.440
 maicon to 70,000 customers and loved in via 

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:06.520
 100,000 which is slightly higher than 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:08.380
 the one who is trying English 

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:10.180
 however I have no doubt that they will go up matt 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:11.590
 of are trying to lower them on 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:13.120
 80 thousand I saw that it is sold 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:15.489
 quite easily 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.080
 i still have johnson and degas rai that 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:19.180
 I'm not bad to sell 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:20.739
 so it is a somewhat strange method it is not 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:22.510
 just a price fixing for us and not 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:24.549
 let's go and buy all the cards 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:27.640
 available on the market we put a 

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:30.340
 price decided we take a 78 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:33.310
 houses of that player and then we put them 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:35.110
 on the market if you want to take it instead 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:36.340
 more like in the case of jones that yes 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:39.700
 quietly rewards at the price of 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:42.670
 scrap in 3d a 16 17 18 cards in the 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:44.470
 same type of player you can put them 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:45.790
 at a distance of ten minutes each 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:48.310
 on the other hand, maybe you put a first one 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:49.810
 then the group of five cards will be auctioned 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:51.220
 after ten minutes it puts so much in the five 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:52.870
 etc. etc. so as not to do 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:54.760
 the impression you are making with 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:56.650
 loans I leave you some pictures of 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.910
 this method that I think works 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:59.799
 because I'm starting to make money 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:01.329
 some credit is not very fast for i 

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:02.980
 its going a week then becomes 

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:04.570
 they don't think of selling them in the first cycle 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:07.180
 where you sell but definitely 

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:09.870
 in the long run you can certainly succeed in 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:11.819
 make money here too happy 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:13.560
 he answers quietly under 13 thousand 

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:15.150
 you believe you managed to sell it for 20,000 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:17.220
 these are screen priests from the forum of 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:20.729
 electronic then a method that to mine 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:22.470
 opinion works quietly if you have 

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:24.810
 be able to come back 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:26.550
 in the investment is an average of 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:28.169
 interesting every week you can 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:29.669
 decide on who to invest so you do 

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:30.720
 attention not invested numbers on 

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:33.870
 players who do not have 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:35.100
 ap then maybe bet them in shape 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:36.449
 garity plays in England that yes 

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:38.100
 they can easily resell them 

00:04:36.449 --> 00:04:39.990
 maicon is also very important 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:42.060
 Brazilian right read very well 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:43.740
 combined with liszt fathers of brazil 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:46.199
 so these are standard spain 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:49.410
 players that have a lot of appeal to us 

00:04:46.199 --> 00:04:51.330
 buyers to sell them more easily 

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:53.490
 so if you take a go go in 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:55.440
 four who plays in liga bbva will not be 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:58.080
 easy to revenge even if sooner or later 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:59.789
 he can easily place it 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:02.550
 every week I'll put it on my page 

00:04:59.789 --> 00:05:04.470
 facebook the players I will invest on 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:06.180
 or if you go to the tracker forum 

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:08.250
 however you will find I will tell you about who 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:09.720
 invest based on what I feel 

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:11.550
 by the British and we will try to 

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:13.620
 make us all a small evening 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:15.810
 this method is definitely works up 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:17.789
 xbox probably heavy on ps3 because 

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:19.530
 a player under 12,000 credits 

00:05:17.789 --> 00:05:22.530
 you can easily sell it to 

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:23.849
 higher price also on ps3 with today 

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:25.500
 we wanted to miss and the video is me 

00:05:23.849 --> 00:05:27.270
 liked the album as described 

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:29.669
 from the channel I recommend you put a mi 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:31.139
 like if video was helpful to you because it is 

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:32.340
 very important to me 

00:05:31.139 --> 00:05:33.990
 I leave a page in the description 

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:36.060
 facebook to see which players there 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:40.220
 recommend from week to week ne 

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:40.220
 I'll choose hi everyone soon
