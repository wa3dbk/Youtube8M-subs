00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:42.280 
which I think are perfect for making it

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:43.549 
which I think are perfect for making it
a<00:00:42.309> little<00:00:42.399> bit<00:00:42.609> more<00:00:42.730> winter<00:00:43.120> looking

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
a little bit more winter looking

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.500 
a little bit more winter looking
obviously<00:00:44.559> the<00:00:45.159> second<00:00:45.550> thing<00:00:45.729> which<00:00:45.969> is<00:00:46.269> the

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:46.510 
obviously the second thing which is the

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:49.020 
obviously the second thing which is the
most<00:00:46.899> important<00:00:47.559> thing<00:00:47.769> the<00:00:48.039> key<00:00:48.460> part<00:00:48.940> to

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:49.030 
most important thing the key part to

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:51.389 
most important thing the key part to
this<00:00:49.269> is<00:00:49.510> tights<00:00:50.260> because<00:00:50.890> if<00:00:51.129> you<00:00:51.190> don't<00:00:51.280> have

life<00:01:11.770> of<00:01:11.950> your<00:01:12.069> dress<00:01:12.280> doesn't<00:01:12.490> necessarily

life of your dress doesn't necessarily

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:14.940

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:22.800 
for the cooler weather and you're not
overexposed<00:01:20.740> too<00:01:21.159> much<00:01:21.340> then<00:01:22.000> the<00:01:22.450> length<00:01:22.659> of

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:22.810 
overexposed too much then the length of

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:24.449 
overexposed too much then the length of
the<00:01:22.899> dress<00:01:23.140> I<00:01:23.380> mean<00:01:23.679> if<00:01:23.860> you<00:01:23.950> could<00:01:24.100> tell<00:01:24.280> the

00:01:24.449 --> 00:01:24.459 
the dress I mean if you could tell the

00:01:24.459 --> 00:01:26.699 
the dress I mean if you could tell the
length<00:01:24.640> of<00:01:24.819> the<00:01:24.880> dress<00:01:25.090> is<00:01:25.299> way<00:01:26.229> above<00:01:26.409> my

00:01:26.699 --> 00:01:26.709 
length of the dress is way above my

00:01:26.709 --> 00:01:30.270 
length of the dress is way above my
being<00:01:26.979> and<00:01:28.319> it<00:01:29.319> still<00:01:29.590> works<00:01:29.799> now<00:01:30.009> it's<00:01:30.159> not

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:30.280 
being and it still works now it's not

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:31.949 
being and it still works now it's not
too<00:01:30.670> fitted<00:01:30.940> it's<00:01:31.179> not<00:01:31.299> too<00:01:31.479> tight<00:01:31.720> to<00:01:31.869> the

00:01:31.949 --> 00:01:31.959 
too fitted it's not too tight to the

00:01:31.959 --> 00:01:33.660 
too fitted it's not too tight to the
body<00:01:32.080> and<00:01:32.500> it's<00:01:32.679> fitted<00:01:32.979> but<00:01:33.100> it's<00:01:33.280> not<00:01:33.399> really

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:33.670 
body and it's fitted but it's not really

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:34.770 
body and it's fitted but it's not really
tight<00:01:33.880> you<00:01:33.970> can<00:01:34.119> see<00:01:34.270> there's<00:01:34.450> a<00:01:34.509> little<00:01:34.659> bit

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:34.780 
tight you can see there's a little bit

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.190 
tight you can see there's a little bit
loose<00:01:35.649> miss<00:01:36.100> to<00:01:36.369> it<00:01:36.520> so<00:01:37.149> that<00:01:37.539> also<00:01:37.780> makes<00:01:38.049> a

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:38.200 
loose miss to it so that also makes a

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.410 
loose miss to it so that also makes a
little<00:01:38.319> bit<00:01:38.440> more<00:01:38.679> appropriate<00:01:38.979> for<00:01:39.549> the

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:40.420 
little bit more appropriate for the

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:42.149 
little bit more appropriate for the
winter<00:01:40.719> time<00:01:40.899> since<00:01:41.200> it's<00:01:41.350> not<00:01:41.500> way<00:01:41.740> or<00:01:41.799> a<00:01:41.979> way

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:42.159 
winter time since it's not way or a way

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:43.800 
winter time since it's not way or a way
to<00:01:42.369> keep<00:01:42.729> in<00:01:42.880> mind<00:01:43.030> where<00:01:43.329> you<00:01:43.539> will<00:01:43.689> be

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:43.810 
to keep in mind where you will be

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:45.810 
to keep in mind where you will be

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
remember is to make sure that if it is a

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:38.670 
remember is to make sure that if it is a
short<00:02:37.209> dress<00:02:37.540> you<00:02:37.810> don't<00:02:37.959> want<00:02:38.109> it<00:02:38.200> to<00:02:38.319> be<00:02:38.440> too

low or deep in the front of the neck

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:42.390 
low or deep in the front of the neck
