00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
playing the map you'll find yourself

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.660 
playing the map you'll find yourself
kind<00:01:13.110> of<00:01:13.170> moving<00:01:13.380> indoors<00:01:13.950> quite<00:01:14.280> a<00:01:14.310> bit<00:01:14.490> and

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
kind of moving indoors quite a bit and

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.690 
kind of moving indoors quite a bit and
that<00:01:15.330> indoor<00:01:15.960> place-based<00:01:16.560> slash<00:01:16.920> vertical

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
that indoor place-based slash vertical

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.789 
that indoor place-based slash vertical
cover<00:01:17.970> really<00:01:18.720> balances<00:01:19.380> out<00:01:19.500> with<00:01:19.710> the

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
cover really balances out with the

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:20.990 
cover really balances out with the
Banshee<00:01:20.189> it<00:01:20.310> makes<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:20.580> bitch<00:01:20.700> you<00:01:20.850> work

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
Banshee it makes the bitch you work

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.780 
Banshee it makes the bitch you work
perfectly<00:01:21.540> great<00:01:22.259> I<00:01:22.560> don't<00:01:22.770> know<00:01:22.979> I<00:01:23.189> can't<00:01:23.640> use

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
perfectly great I don't know I can't use

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.100 
perfectly great I don't know I can't use
proper<00:01:24.090> grammar<00:01:24.270> because<00:01:24.450> I'm<00:01:24.630> excited<00:01:24.990> but

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
proper grammar because I'm excited but

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.469 
proper grammar because I'm excited but
it<00:01:25.650> makes<00:01:25.890> the<00:01:26.040> Banshee<00:01:26.400> work<00:01:26.610> amazing<00:01:27.299> and

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
it makes the Banshee work amazing and

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.090 
it makes the Banshee work amazing and
the<00:01:27.930> fact<00:01:28.140> that<00:01:28.350> he's<00:01:28.500> actually<00:01:28.799> worked<00:01:28.979> in

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
the fact that he's actually worked in

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.770 
the fact that he's actually worked in
quite<00:01:29.520> a<00:01:29.549> bit<00:01:29.729> of<00:01:29.820> power<00:01:29.939> weapons<00:01:30.420> I<00:01:30.540> I<00:01:30.720> know

there's a lot of vertical cover the

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.149 
there's a lot of vertical cover the
Banshee<00:01:45.990> is<00:01:46.110> very<00:01:46.380> balanced<00:01:46.829> you<00:01:46.890> don't<00:01:47.040> need

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
Banshee is very balanced you don't need

to<00:01:47.250> worry<00:01:47.399> about<00:01:47.460> it<00:01:47.729> just<00:01:48.030> absolutely

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
to worry about it just absolutely

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.240

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
destroying everybody and everything on

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:51.679 
destroying everybody and everything on
the<00:01:50.310> map<00:01:50.460> it<00:01:50.640> works<00:01:50.790> really<00:01:50.970> well<00:01:51.090> and<00:01:51.420> even<00:01:51.509> at

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
the map it works really well and even at

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.630 
the map it works really well and even at
that<00:01:51.869> you<00:01:52.470> don't<00:01:52.680> have<00:01:52.799> that<00:01:52.860> much<00:01:53.220> area<00:01:53.520> to

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
that you don't have that much area to

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:54.980 
that you don't have that much area to
fly<00:01:53.880> in<00:01:54.030> the<00:01:54.119> Banshees<00:01:54.450> so<00:01:54.570> it's<00:01:54.689> kind<00:01:54.840> of<00:01:54.869> like

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
fly in the Banshees so it's kind of like

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.080 
fly in the Banshees so it's kind of like
a<00:01:55.020> power<00:01:55.229> weapon<00:01:55.560> spawns<00:01:56.130> maybe<00:01:56.369> I<00:01:56.460> think<00:01:56.640> it's

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
a power weapon spawns maybe I think it's

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.120 
a power weapon spawns maybe I think it's
180<00:01:57.600> I'm<00:01:57.840> not<00:01:58.049> too<00:01:58.320> sure<00:01:58.500> about<00:01:58.619> the<00:01:58.799> timer<00:01:59.009> I

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
180 I'm not too sure about the timer I

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.160 
180 I'm not too sure about the timer I
could<00:01:59.280> be<00:01:59.399> wrong<00:01:59.520> but<00:02:00.119> it's<00:02:00.479> very<00:02:00.600> balanced<00:02:01.079> it

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
could be wrong but it's very balanced it

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.249 
could be wrong but it's very balanced it
works<00:02:01.290> very<00:02:01.590> well<00:02:01.740> and<00:02:02.130> I<00:02:03.000> love<00:02:03.630> it<00:02:03.750> I<00:02:03.899> love

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
works very well and I love it I love

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.080 
works very well and I love it I love
that<00:02:04.500> he's<00:02:04.619> able<00:02:04.890> to<00:02:05.100> put<00:02:05.490> a<00:02:05.520> banshee<00:02:05.729> in<00:02:05.939> this

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:55.289 
risk versus reward so you are able to
jump<00:02:54.069> from<00:02:54.159> ledge<00:02:54.489> to<00:02:54.730> ledge<00:02:54.849> which<00:02:55.120> is<00:02:55.269> a

00:02:55.289 --> 00:02:55.299 
jump from ledge to ledge which is a

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:56.789 
jump from ledge to ledge which is a
quicker<00:02:55.629> route<00:02:55.840> across<00:02:56.109> the<00:02:56.319> map<00:02:56.439> also<00:02:56.709> you

00:02:56.789 --> 00:02:56.799 
quicker route across the map also you

00:02:56.799 --> 00:02:58.110 
quicker route across the map also you
can<00:02:56.919> actually<00:02:57.010> jump<00:02:57.310> on<00:02:57.459> top<00:02:57.579> of<00:02:57.790> some<00:02:57.939> of<00:02:58.030> the

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
can actually jump on top of some of the

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.789 
can actually jump on top of some of the
buildings<00:02:58.780> are<00:02:58.930> at<00:02:59.019> the<00:02:59.139> different<00:02:59.620> pathways

00:02:59.789 --> 00:02:59.799 
buildings are at the different pathways

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:01.979 
buildings are at the different pathways
which<00:03:00.609> leaves<00:03:00.879> you<00:03:00.970> very<00:03:01.150> exposed<00:03:01.540> also<00:03:01.930> you

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:01.989 
which leaves you very exposed also you

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:03.390 
which leaves you very exposed also you
run<00:03:02.169> the<00:03:02.290> risk<00:03:02.379> of<00:03:02.500> actually<00:03:02.680> falling<00:03:02.950> off<00:03:03.220> the

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400 
run the risk of actually falling off the

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.420 
run the risk of actually falling off the
map<00:03:03.549> so<00:03:03.790> risk<00:03:04.540> versus<00:03:04.900> reward<00:03:05.250> banshee

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 
map so risk versus reward banshee
