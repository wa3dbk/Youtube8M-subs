00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
to completely get rid of it as if it's

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.069 
to completely get rid of it as if it's
not<00:00:51.660> there<00:00:52.850> so<00:00:53.850> I'm<00:00:53.940> starting<00:00:54.420> by<00:00:54.570> pinching

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
not there so I'm starting by pinching

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.270 
not there so I'm starting by pinching
the<00:00:55.969> wrap<00:00:56.969> between<00:00:57.390> my<00:00:57.600> thumb<00:00:57.930> and<00:00:58.280> index

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.459 
the wrap between my thumb and index
finger<00:00:59.510> and<00:01:00.510> I'm<00:01:00.750> going<00:01:00.930> to<00:01:00.989> wrap<00:01:01.199> it<00:01:01.260> around

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
finger and I'm going to wrap it around

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.420 
finger and I'm going to wrap it around
my<00:01:01.770> hands<00:01:02.460> my<00:01:03.120> hands<00:01:03.589> four<00:01:04.589> times<00:01:04.860> so<00:01:05.250> that's

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
my hands my hands four times so that's

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:11.690 
my hands my hands four times so that's
one<00:01:06.080> that's<00:01:07.080> two<00:01:08.360> that's<00:01:09.360> three<00:01:10.490> that's<00:01:11.490> four

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
one that's two that's three that's four

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.480 
one that's two that's three that's four
so<00:01:12.689> on<00:01:12.840> the<00:01:12.960> fourth<00:01:13.200> time<00:01:13.590> I<00:01:13.619> want<00:01:14.159> to<00:01:14.220> leave

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
so on the fourth time I want to leave

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:21.920 
so on the fourth time I want to leave
just<00:01:15.000> about<00:01:15.990> an<00:01:16.170> inch<00:01:16.439> at<00:01:16.619> the<00:01:16.650> bottom

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:27.469 

of<00:01:21.990> the<00:01:22.530> rap<00:01:22.740> for<00:01:23.040> me<00:01:23.130> to<00:01:23.250> grab<00:01:23.430> onto

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.240 

so<00:01:28.049> when<00:01:28.200> I'm<00:01:28.350> done<00:01:28.560> it<00:01:28.740> should<00:01:28.890> look<00:01:29.070> similar

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
so when I'm done it should look similar

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.620 
so when I'm done it should look similar
to<00:01:29.460> this<00:01:31.250> I'm<00:01:32.250> gonna<00:01:32.490> take<00:01:32.820> that<00:01:33.000> inch<00:01:33.299> that<00:01:33.509> I
