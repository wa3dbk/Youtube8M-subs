00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:25.750 
look at the base see how tight it is to

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:28.319 
look at the base see how tight it is to
the<00:00:25.840> skin<00:00:26.199> this<00:00:26.439> one's<00:00:26.739> about<00:00:27.399> that<00:00:27.880> far<00:00:28.149> out

00:00:28.319 --> 00:00:28.329 
the skin this one's about that far out

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:30.659 
the skin this one's about that far out
from<00:00:28.750> the<00:00:28.929> skin<00:00:29.289> which<00:00:29.590> is<00:00:29.619> great<00:00:30.099> that's<00:00:30.399> not

00:00:30.659 --> 00:00:30.669 
from the skin which is great that's not

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:32.670 
from the skin which is great that's not
a<00:00:30.699> tight<00:00:31.000> math<00:00:31.269> this<00:00:31.509> is<00:00:31.570> about<00:00:31.899> ten<00:00:32.290> days<00:00:32.439> to

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:32.680 
a tight math this is about ten days to
