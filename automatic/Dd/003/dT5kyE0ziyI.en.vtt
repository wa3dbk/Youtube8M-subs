00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
why Charlie was so hip and why we can

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.819 
why Charlie was so hip and why we can
still<00:02:04.890> draw<00:02:05.520> on<00:02:05.759> his<00:02:06.000> influence<00:02:06.570> today<00:02:06.930> now

they were gonna get down to it and the

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.740

rhythm<00:02:19.710> that<00:02:19.890> they<00:02:20.160> played<00:02:20.400> was<00:02:20.730> a<00:02:20.760> very<00:02:21.300> easy

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750

electricity<00:02:32.160> was<00:02:32.730> to<00:02:33.000> basically<00:02:34.340> partner<00:02:35.340> up

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:35.490 
electricity was to basically partner up

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:36.710 
electricity was to basically partner up
with<00:02:35.520> the<00:02:35.760> kick<00:02:35.940> drum<00:02:36.210> and<00:02:36.330> lay<00:02:36.480> down<00:02:36.510> a

pattern<00:02:37.140> like<00:02:37.320> this<00:02:50.390> so<00:02:51.390> what<00:02:51.660> he<00:02:51.780> transferred

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
pattern like this so what he transferred

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:55.520 
pattern like this so what he transferred
from<00:02:52.620> his<00:02:52.830> rhythm<00:02:53.310> role<00:02:54.240> as<00:02:54.540> a<00:02:54.600> guitar<00:02:55.290> player

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.720 
in a big band was a profound sense of
how<00:02:58.800> to<00:02:58.860> play<00:02:59.190> time<00:02:59.660> with<00:03:00.660> his<00:03:00.840> melodies<00:03:01.320> and

how to play time with his melodies and

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:04.190 
how to play time with his melodies and
what<00:03:02.730> Charlie<00:03:03.120> would<00:03:03.270> do<00:03:03.480> is<00:03:03.690> he<00:03:03.840> would<00:03:03.870> play

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
what Charlie would do is he would play

what Charlie would do is he would play
syncopated<00:03:05.010> line<00:03:05.190> syncopation<00:03:05.970> means<00:03:06.180> he

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
syncopated line syncopation means he

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:09.800 
syncopated line syncopation means he
shift<00:03:06.630> the<00:03:06.780> accents<00:03:07.430> on<00:03:08.430> and<00:03:08.760> off<00:03:08.910> the<00:03:09.120> beat<00:03:09.330> to

shift the accents on and off the beat to

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.330 
shift the accents on and off the beat to
create<00:03:10.110> something<00:03:10.380> that<00:03:10.530> has<00:03:10.710> a<00:03:10.830> little<00:03:11.070> kind

of a sort of an internal energy to it so

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:17.180 
of a sort of an internal energy to it so
a<00:03:14.490> great<00:03:14.730> example<00:03:14.760> of<00:03:15.270> Charlie's<00:03:16.190> imagination

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
a great example of Charlie's imagination

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:20.630 
a great example of Charlie's imagination
as<00:03:17.340> a<00:03:17.370> syncopated<00:03:18.080> melody<00:03:19.080> player<00:03:19.620> is<00:03:19.920> shown

as a syncopated melody player is shown

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:33.590 
as a syncopated melody player is shown
in<00:03:20.790> Figure<00:03:20.820> one<00:03:21.330> one<00:03:21.660> two<00:03:22.170> three<00:03:22.800> four<00:03:23.370> now<00:03:32.600> he

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:33.600 
in Figure one one two three four now he

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:35.540 
in Figure one one two three four now he
plays<00:03:33.810> just<00:03:34.140> on<00:03:34.350> the<00:03:34.470> down<00:03:34.650> beats<00:03:34.950> until<00:03:35.459> he

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:35.550 
plays just on the down beats until he

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:37.610 
plays just on the down beats until he
puts<00:03:35.760> in<00:03:35.880> that<00:03:36.090> little<00:03:36.390> upbeat<00:03:36.840> and<00:03:37.050> that<00:03:37.260> kind

of gives it this little kick of energy
and<00:03:39.450> then<00:03:40.020> he<00:03:40.140> outlines<00:03:40.530> a<00:03:40.709> major<00:03:40.980> triad

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:44.720 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:47.270 

that's<00:03:45.720> very<00:03:45.900> typical<00:03:46.110> of<00:03:46.500> Charlie's<00:03:46.920> style

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
that's very typical of Charlie's style

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.550 
that's very typical of Charlie's style
is<00:03:47.459> that<00:03:47.490> he<00:03:47.730> would<00:03:47.880> combine<00:03:48.090> a<00:03:48.540> very<00:03:49.050> simple

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
is that he would combine a very simple

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.890 
is that he would combine a very simple
rhythmic<00:03:49.800> phrase<00:03:50.300> with<00:03:51.300> something<00:03:51.720> that

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
rhythmic phrase with something that

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.140 
rhythmic phrase with something that
starts<00:03:52.260> to<00:03:52.380> develop<00:03:52.680> in<00:03:52.980> a<00:03:53.070> more<00:03:53.310> melodically

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
starts to develop in a more melodically

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.930 
starts to develop in a more melodically
complex<00:03:54.959> way<00:03:55.230> and<00:03:55.500> he<00:03:55.860> was<00:03:56.100> a<00:03:56.310> guy<00:03:56.910> who

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 
complex way and he was a guy who

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:58.790 
complex way and he was a guy who
outlined<00:03:57.660> the<00:03:57.959> changes<00:03:58.380> he<00:03:58.500> knew<00:03:58.650> his

arpeggios and he played the changes

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:02.420 
arpeggios and he played the changes
often<00:04:01.110> vertically<00:04:01.740> up<00:04:01.890> and<00:04:02.010> down<00:04:02.220> now

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
often vertically up and down now

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:04.580 
often vertically up and down now
according<00:04:03.209> to<00:04:03.480> people<00:04:03.930> that<00:04:04.080> knew<00:04:04.290> Charlie

interviews<00:04:06.600> talking<00:04:06.990> about<00:04:07.200> his<00:04:07.320> technique

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
interviews talking about his technique

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:09.979 
interviews talking about his technique
they<00:04:08.490> say<00:04:08.670> well<00:04:08.850> he<00:04:08.970> mostly<00:04:09.300> down<00:04:09.630> picked

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:09.989 
they say well he mostly down picked

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:11.210 
they say well he mostly down picked
which<00:04:10.200> is<00:04:10.350> hard<00:04:10.530> to<00:04:10.590> believe<00:04:10.680> because<00:04:11.010> he

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 
which is hard to believe because he

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:13.130 
which is hard to believe because he
moved<00:04:11.370> around<00:04:11.580> quite<00:04:11.850> a<00:04:12.000> bit<00:04:12.239> but<00:04:12.720> he<00:04:12.780> didn't

kind of move the lick rhythmically to
different<00:04:57.389> points<00:04:57.750> in<00:04:57.900> the<00:04:58.349> progression<00:04:58.710> so

00:04:59.420 --> 00:04:59.430 
different points in the progression so

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:01.490 
different points in the progression so
in<00:04:59.550> Figure<00:04:59.849> 2<00:05:00.120> you<00:05:00.360> see<00:05:00.569> an<00:05:00.690> example<00:05:00.780> of<00:05:01.409> that

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:01.500 
in Figure 2 you see an example of that

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:04.279 
in Figure 2 you see an example of that
idea<00:05:02.460> where<00:05:02.759> he<00:05:02.849> takes<00:05:03.000> a<00:05:03.210> simple<00:05:03.659> melody<00:05:03.960> and

00:05:04.279 --> 00:05:04.289 
idea where he takes a simple melody and

00:05:04.289 --> 00:05:06.110 
idea where he takes a simple melody and
shifts<00:05:05.099> it<00:05:05.190> around<00:05:05.430> and<00:05:05.639> twist<00:05:05.759> it<00:05:06.090> and

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:06.120 
shifts it around and twist it and

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:07.909 
shifts it around and twist it and
evolves<00:05:06.870> it<00:05:06.990> into<00:05:07.259> something<00:05:07.469> that's<00:05:07.770> much

00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:07.919 
evolves it into something that's much

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:10.010 
evolves it into something that's much
more<00:05:08.159> sophisticated<00:05:08.569> so<00:05:09.569> played<00:05:09.990> slowly

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:10.020 
more sophisticated so played slowly

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:27.050 
more sophisticated so played slowly
figure<00:05:10.949> 2<00:05:11.159> goes<00:05:11.430> like<00:05:11.669> this<00:05:11.909> 1<00:05:12.509> 2<00:05:12.949> A<00:05:13.949> 1<00:05:14.520> 2<00:05:15.360> 3<00:05:26.060> so

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:27.060 
figure 2 goes like this 1 2 A 1 2 3 so

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:28.399 
figure 2 goes like this 1 2 A 1 2 3 so
you<00:05:27.090> have<00:05:27.300> the<00:05:27.389> feeling<00:05:27.779> that<00:05:27.870> the<00:05:28.020> phrase<00:05:28.229> is

00:05:28.399 --> 00:05:28.409 
you have the feeling that the phrase is

00:05:28.409 --> 00:05:31.189 
you have the feeling that the phrase is
like<00:05:28.590> speeding<00:05:29.190> up<00:05:29.400> because<00:05:30.300> he<00:05:30.449> eliminates

00:05:31.189 --> 00:05:31.199 
like speeding up because he eliminates

00:05:31.199 --> 00:05:33.499 
like speeding up because he eliminates
the<00:05:31.319> gap<00:05:31.529> between<00:05:31.800> the<00:05:32.159> repetitions<00:05:32.819> starts

00:05:33.499 --> 00:05:33.509 
the gap between the repetitions starts

00:05:33.509 --> 00:05:37.040 
the gap between the repetitions starts
to<00:05:33.569> change<00:05:33.810> the<00:05:33.990> melody<00:05:34.349> and<00:05:34.529> then<00:05:36.020> plays<00:05:37.020> a

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:37.050 
to change the melody and then plays a

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:39.469 
to change the melody and then plays a
little<00:05:37.349> alteration<00:05:37.979> there<00:05:38.460> and<00:05:38.699> he<00:05:39.210> was<00:05:39.330> one

00:05:39.469 --> 00:05:39.479 
little alteration there and he was one

00:05:39.479 --> 00:05:41.390 
little alteration there and he was one
of<00:05:39.509> the<00:05:39.659> pioneers<00:05:40.289> in<00:05:40.409> the<00:05:40.710> sense<00:05:40.949> of<00:05:41.099> using

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:41.400 
of the pioneers in the sense of using

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:43.370 
of the pioneers in the sense of using
melodic<00:05:41.909> alteration<00:05:42.599> in<00:05:42.750> the<00:05:42.870> key<00:05:43.050> of<00:05:43.080> b-flat

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:43.380 
melodic alteration in the key of b-flat

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:47.360 
melodic alteration in the key of b-flat
that's<00:05:44.340> like<00:05:44.490> an<00:05:44.669> e-flat<00:05:45.180> minor<00:05:46.130> triad<00:05:47.130> the

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:47.370 
that's like an e-flat minor triad the

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:49.909 
that's like an e-flat minor triad the
four<00:05:47.759> minor<00:05:48.240> four<00:05:48.810> chord<00:05:49.080> and<00:05:49.229> even<00:05:49.469> a<00:05:49.560> b-flat

00:05:49.909 --> 00:05:49.919 
four minor four chord and even a b-flat

00:05:49.919 --> 00:05:53.240 
four minor four chord and even a b-flat
is<00:05:50.159> a<00:05:50.370> flattened<00:05:50.819> so<00:05:51.449> you<00:05:51.539> got<00:05:51.840> D<00:05:52.740> flat<00:05:53.009> minor

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:53.250 
is a flattened so you got D flat minor

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:55.129 
is a flattened so you got D flat minor
which<00:05:53.550> is<00:05:53.580> sort<00:05:53.909> of<00:05:53.940> a<00:05:54.060> substitute<00:05:54.629> court<00:05:54.960> so

00:05:55.129 --> 00:05:55.139 
which is sort of a substitute court so

00:05:55.139 --> 00:05:57.559 
which is sort of a substitute court so
in<00:05:55.289> his<00:05:55.379> melodies<00:05:55.979> he's<00:05:56.580> using<00:05:56.940> alterations

00:05:57.559 --> 00:05:57.569 
in his melodies he's using alterations

00:05:57.569 --> 00:06:02.269 
in his melodies he's using alterations
to<00:05:57.719> create<00:05:58.370> kind<00:05:59.370> of<00:05:59.430> a<00:05:59.520> more<00:06:01.069> what<00:06:02.069> would<00:06:02.190> you

00:06:02.269 --> 00:06:02.279 
to create kind of a more what would you

00:06:02.279 --> 00:06:05.450 
to create kind of a more what would you
call<00:06:02.460> it<00:06:02.580> a<00:06:02.669> colorful<00:06:03.240> melodic<00:06:04.229> line<00:06:04.500> using<00:06:05.400> a

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:05.460 
call it a colorful melodic line using a

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:09.230 
call it a colorful melodic line using a
little<00:06:05.699> bit<00:06:05.819> of<00:06:05.909> dissonance<00:06:06.449> in<00:06:06.659> there<00:06:06.870> so<00:06:08.240> at

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:09.240 
little bit of dissonance in there so at

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:10.760 
little bit of dissonance in there so at
the<00:06:09.389> end<00:06:09.539> of<00:06:09.659> the<00:06:09.750> phrase<00:06:10.020> he<00:06:10.259> does<00:06:10.469> another

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:10.770 
the end of the phrase he does another

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:14.809 
the end of the phrase he does another
favorite<00:06:11.159> trick<00:06:11.370> which<00:06:11.610> is<00:06:11.639> the<00:06:11.969> sweep<00:06:13.819> now

00:06:14.809 --> 00:06:14.819 
favorite trick which is the sweep now

00:06:14.819 --> 00:06:16.909 
favorite trick which is the sweep now
what<00:06:15.419> you<00:06:15.509> got<00:06:15.659> there<00:06:15.810> is<00:06:15.870> a<00:06:15.930> major<00:06:16.169> triad<00:06:16.500> root

00:06:16.909 --> 00:06:16.919 
what you got there is a major triad root

00:06:16.919 --> 00:06:21.290 
what you got there is a major triad root
third<00:06:17.460> fifth<00:06:17.900> with<00:06:18.900> that<00:06:19.139> C<00:06:19.469> up<00:06:19.650> on<00:06:19.830> top<00:06:20.300> and

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:21.300 
third fifth with that C up on top and

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:24.860 
third fifth with that C up on top and
just<00:06:21.360> drag<00:06:21.779> the<00:06:21.960> pick<00:06:22.139> all<00:06:22.379> down<00:06:22.620> storm

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:24.870 
just drag the pick all down storm

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:27.900 
just drag the pick all down storm
right<00:06:25.870> he<00:06:26.560> uses<00:06:26.860> that<00:06:26.980> all<00:06:27.040> over<00:06:27.430> the<00:06:27.520> places
