00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.420
 I greet you dear friends dear 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:08.040
 channel colleagues and viewers will talk more 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.940
 about one serious problem that 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:14.460
 present our work this problem 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:17.820
 called fear and get money 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.770
 the fact is that I am gradually improving 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.109
 the job 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:25.320
 removed some major problem 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:28.320
 questions and float to the surface more 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:32.040
 so to speak petty invisible so to speak 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:38.250
 background here and this question is the same 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:42.090
 the background I noticed that on every object 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:45.100
 I conduct some internal monologue that I 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:48.730
 I will do if the client 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:50.160
 won't give me the full amount well i am now 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:52.750
 exaggerate a little 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.570
 maybe our consciousness is somehow 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:59.530
 disguises that we are not afraid but in any 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:01.449
 case the fact remains a fact to me that 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:04.149
 I conduct some internal monologue 

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:06.850
 I speak for the client who makes 

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:10.810
 I have no complaints and I'm trying to justify myself 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:14.259
 on the other hand when i work at 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:16.330
 someone gratuitously also arises 

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:18.520
 dialogue also this person can 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:21.520
 make a claim but the situation 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:24.490
 somewhat different i'm more relaxed 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:27.100
 calmly working eliminating identified 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:29.619
 flaws not trying to disguise them 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.960
 that is, I do not have such a goal to hide 

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:35.679
 I do not finish the work I like to do work 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:40.509
 good quality in connection with this here 

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:42.580
 these two situations show that 

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:45.970
 there is something 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:50.200
 what creates stress when you 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:53.110
 working with a client some will say 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:56.079
 it's okay next you will see it 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:58.149
 not quite normal there is something that 

00:01:56.079 --> 00:02:01.750
 hiding so to speak 

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:04.630
 ok but not so 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:08.649
 let's go back to the situation when the client 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:14.079
 pay us money and we reveal 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:16.540
 internal dialogue speak for the client and 

00:02:14.079 --> 00:02:19.690
 we are serving him something and so on 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:22.269
 often expressed in such an emotional 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:24.640
 can we even do it with friends 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:27.640
 discuss with colleagues, he said something wrong 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:30.900
 he is wrong then I told him that this is all 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:35.079
 signs of this internal monologue 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:36.880
 I wondered why this is why I 

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:38.260
 I conduct such a monologue of her as if he 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:42.280
 distraction spends some kind of emotional 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:44.470
 resources my time is mine and so on on 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:49.000
 the surface surfaced the next problem i 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:52.600
 I'm afraid that I do not get paid to whether evil 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.710
 there is even some potential fear 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:57.200
 that they won't pay me at all 

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:59.900
 Next, we'll talk about that analyze 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:02.240
 extreme points of this situation and so on 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:04.780
 but here's the fear that the money will not pay and I 

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:08.450
 they will be forced in some way 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:12.110
 defend means when I realized that here 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:14.270
 this kind of fear exists tried 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:17.960
 analyze it and so this feeling 

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:22.940
 our fear is limited to two things 

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:27.200
 and let's say that two forces that 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:31.970
 act on one side and on the other side 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:36.980
 I certainly donâ€™t want to lose one hand 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:40.520
 money but let's say not to participate in 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:44.090
 conflict I could have this some money 

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:46.610
 to concede moreover even I thought that 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:50.420
 you can generally leave the object without receiving 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:53.000
 there is a salary here but 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:55.130
 to participate in the conflict can be so 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.660
 You do not die you can actually 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:58.670
 in general, then even this on the one hand 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:02.560
 looks beautiful imagine yes such 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:02.560
 the master is gone well, I donâ€™t know 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:09.110
 extreme restraint they just 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:13.220
 master it on one side on the other 

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:15.770
 parties second force is David and tells you 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:17.510
 wait how are you giving up the money 

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:21.650
 do you understand if you will perform here 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:25.430
 then you will continue to push and 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:27.470
 this is not a normal situation is one thing 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:31.010
 cede voluntarily to make a discount from 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:32.930
 friend and when they make you cheat 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:35.180
 manipulates you and some here 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:37.100
 inner pride or pride she 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:39.290
 you say you ca n't do that 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:41.330
 you are at work now you are an official 

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:44.060
 responsibly you can't just 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:48.380
 turn and go and here's under 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:52.130
 by the impact of these two forces, we 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:56.440
 are we need to make a decision and 

00:04:52.130 --> 00:05:00.500
 here you go balancing and here 

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:02.660
 finding here this solution point is and 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:07.180
 there is this internal dialogue 

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:10.040
 we are trying to find the point where we are 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:12.400
 Satisfy both the first force and the second force 

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:16.250
 yes, I repeat 

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:18.230
 the first force is due to the fact that it is not necessary for 

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:20.690
 every penny bite down to give in there 

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:22.090
 if something yes the author of the body says well 

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:24.680
 what kind of rag are you 

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:27.800
 You're at work here and an official 

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:28.850
 please do your duty here 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:31.250
 this is an internal dialogue 

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:35.590
 next let's see how with this 

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:35.590
 understand the actual exit there
