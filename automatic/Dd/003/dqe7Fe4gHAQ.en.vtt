 the quantities they take form of the main 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.750
 counted quantities of garlic 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.119
 grinds and turns pasta 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.790
 which is well kept in the fridge and 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.450
 can be used in some cases 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.539
 for my 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:55.259
 and here I am such a marinade such marinade 

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:55.710
 gives a certain specific tastes 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:01.369
 fish 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:01.369
 which of course is very and complementary
