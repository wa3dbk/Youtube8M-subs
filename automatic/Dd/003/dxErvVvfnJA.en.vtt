00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:07.890
 an almost forgotten place in Berlin 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.510
 At the tram parking garage you can still dimly the old 

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:13.069
 Detect ferris wheel 

00:00:13.069 --> 00:00:16.129
 with a dancer a few meters further down stand the remnants of the 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:19.230
 Game days overgrown and almost bitter 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.500
 Aigner since he spent his childhood there and now guides about the 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.089
 The grounds are organized by Christoph Klotter 

00:00:25.089 --> 00:00:26.350
 I just do it 

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:29.380
 For me, the heart is here for me very much in the mouth 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:33.739
 Whether I'm alone every weekend sports games or know today 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:34.670
 take with 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:36.370
 it is almost certain 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:39.880
 just under a third of the 35 rides are still at their disposal 

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:40.710
 old place 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.710
 the rest went back to showman colleagues or became ridiculous 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.160
 sold 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.110
 Lack of money wash a problem earlier 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:50.110
 and the main reason for the closure 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.680
 under 95 but never white water raft on the bank where just up and down 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.200
 The whole they should later you could finally have the steel frame around the 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.710
 Why afford Berg and again half a year later were finally money 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.480
 for the populists 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.780
 charming is the first match day 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.350
 and in its present state a popular backdrop for photographers as well 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:12.350
 film and television productions 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.840
 It would also be music videos filmed if you have me the subject goodbye 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.210
 besides, strangely enough, all really without exception this bridge 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:23.920
 The band is on top of it this summer 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.740
 our bridge runs through a sad performer disappears into the 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:28.990
 hedge 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:32.330
 even if he later lies hidden creative, he is not undetected 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.310
 the guard is trying to assess the club quite but it does not succeed 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:38.110
 always 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:41.230
 after all, season a few weeks also drive the leg choppy throttling 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:43.560
 Tusks eyes opened 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:44.700
 July their service 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.000
 you have to be your being battery operated SPD so have already 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
 for open channels 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.360
 that's special 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:59.570
 there are in Germany 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:03.250
 so rich and beautiful that he gives himself again »death in the amusement park brutal 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:06.700
 love it is all open because we have left us in the cabin 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:12.060
 s5j everything to it always decays more than 40 degrees prevails again 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.820
 Sell ​​spooky out-of-town places that were popular for where they are from their children 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:17.739
 continues 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:20.739
 the video evidence has been transferred 

00:02:21.509 --> 00:02:23.619
 that stands and waits 

00:02:23.619 --> 00:02:27.219
 what is the Spreepark waiting for you to try again and if you can 

00:02:27.219 --> 00:02:29.339
 to return an amusement park 

00:02:29.339 --> 00:02:32.709
 The former operator Norbert Witte would like this idea 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:36.099
 one also says so 

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:39.099
 a feeling of wanting such a bad and 

00:02:39.689 --> 00:02:42.479
 For me, the early universe was lifestyle and that comes with the 

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:44.649
 Mormon 

00:02:44.649 --> 00:02:47.339
 I am of course picking up a nice one again 

00:02:47.339 --> 00:02:51.519
 Nearly two million visitors a year were expected to be around 4,000 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:52.989
 actually come 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:56.249
 a reopening would be possible at most on a smaller scale 

00:02:56.249 --> 00:02:59.249
 with fewer rides calculable expenses 

00:02:59.249 --> 00:03:01.219
 when the partner opens again 

00:03:01.219 --> 00:03:04.119
 if the persons and actually only have winners 

00:03:04.119 --> 00:03:05.749
 and what not 

00:03:05.749 --> 00:03:09.879
 and until then Christoph Hartmann will continue to be interested in his tours 

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:12.189
 Show visitors a piece of Berlin's city history
