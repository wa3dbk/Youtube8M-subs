00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:05.940
 hello to all these adoptions come together 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.160
 for a new video 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.059
 it's an art tip on this lob where I 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.179
 will explain my movements 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.110
 as well as the spawn as I had 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.630
 done for stan should you have been 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.609
 a lot to ask me had the same video 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.810
 on other map so here I am them 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.970
 do I'm going I'm going to do mostly 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.740
 playmate decerto also so here I am 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.480
 you put two as the fight 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.580
 of foreheads in red the evil spirits neither 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:30.599
 towards the good spoon then it takes 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:32.399
 know that the hung up on on 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.390
 other maps besides stand-up what the 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.340
 structures this nine was really 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.980
 predefined on all other maps on 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.230
 Feel less because there is more spoon 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.170
 possible and so it will really depend 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.520
 of your teammates and your enemies from 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.899
 placement of your friends for example elderly 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.579
 pass exactly where I surrounded 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.629
 because our enemies are oriented rather 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.930
 to the right of the amap to the 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.980
 polish angola so if I had wanted 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.180
 really show you all the scouts 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.710
 I would have already surrounded a lot of 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.230
 young people so that was it would have been more 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.969
 use the thing code so that's it 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:04.140
 the go the good sprints or just 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:06.659
 backwards for the p2 it's also 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.950
 as simple as that really the next 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.200
 point which is a very important point 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.610
 because we can do a lot of 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.290
 points without the friends approaching 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.020
 it's really a very easy point to 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.460
 defend it just have that spin there 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:20.640
 the enemies already what a super far 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.200
 towards the blue or at the garage level and 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.780
 if they want to take the point here 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.430
 is going to have a lot of points on this p 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.330
 2 they must have splendors 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.850
 passed through this year which is 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.590
 really easy to defend especially if 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.509
 the friends of the fumigene gesppe or 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.220
 things like that it's really a year 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:38.070
 easy to defend whether they 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:40.070
 try to push through the blue it's 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:43.020
 as easy to defend in quotation marks 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:44.430
 by by my teammates to know that if 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.960
 my teammates die they go 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.240
 go back right behind and they go they 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.040
 can return easily 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:52.290
 so here's a little trick on this 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.479
 point do not hesitate to that kitchen 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.969
 spoon pushed that's how I do it 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.619
 20 seconds to come out of the spawn the goal 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:00.540
 being giving this spleen so has it 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.850
 the old good sprint for the pde to our 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.979
 opponents to make them spoon and 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.990
 super far from the next point there when 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.920
 you see we pushed 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:08.879
 get some that remained on the point there 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.110
 turned around you can see on the 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:11.640
 little card and that's someone trying 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.790
 of someone and the bad spirit the idea 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.469
 it's going to see him 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.329
 it's great for us because they 're going 

00:02:14.469 --> 00:02:17.890
 they walked really great far and 

00:02:16.329 --> 00:02:21.129
 we can anticipate the next spot 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:22.180
 so here it is the fountain the launderette 

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:23.400
 more exactly one must be in the 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.269
 laundry to really have the spirit 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:28.780
 but the fountain is a very important 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:31.379
 easy to really have a 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:33.129
 view and be able to play them easily 

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:33.750
 everyone trying to change 

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:36.340
 the mind 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:38.590
 so that's the laundry very 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:41.139
 important and for those p3 and for the p4 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:43.180
 garage it's really so a team 

00:02:41.139 --> 00:02:44.920
 can really keep this spleen there 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:46.959
 can be so many points so to 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.780
 know 120 120 points that can be 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:51.939
 looked pretty easily need to know 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.769
 that if if you do not push the feathers 

00:02:51.939 --> 00:02:55.269
 for that one he is really very very 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:57.099
 difficult to have points it's 

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:58.569
 virtually data points to at 

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:00.340
 the opponent that's why it takes 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:02.349
 really keep his chickens at the 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.700
 protect and for the team that has not us 

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:04.269
 really attacks and it's really 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.510
 Very important 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:09.489
 example to for the garage as the admit 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:10.870
 the opponents you really had to go 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:12.549
 by the right was trying to go through the 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:15.639
 the blue to have a more list 

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:17.139
 behind behind the p3a see the the 

00:03:15.639 --> 00:03:19.629
 fountain it's very very important I 

00:03:17.139 --> 00:03:21.819
 repeat again to these sentences part series 

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:24.010
 on it all the same way as for 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:26.709
 this nine i really wanted before a 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:28.299
 quick part to avoid any 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:30.459
 simply that which is several points 

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:32.530
 who are coming back and for really you 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:35.199
 show our displacement for you 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:37.690
 explain why at last the way 

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:39.370
 which one must move between 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:42.430
 quotes to have the right spoon and 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:44.799
 give the bad to our opponents 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:48.310
 this is a scream that we made a 

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:50.370
 scream with yacco agony get some and 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:55.419
 this is the first the first part 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:57.659
 we did against a mix so I think 

00:03:55.419 --> 00:03:57.659
 here 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:05.319
 for this point there for the t4 so it takes 

00:04:02.439 --> 00:04:07.750
 know that the good spoon so that was 

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:10.000
 fountain are going to be very bad for the 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:13.569
 point after that because they can do us 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.219
 lose and the p1 and p2 the south after 

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:16.750
 so we will really try to push 

00:04:15.219 --> 00:04:19.000
 you see my teammates we know each other 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:19.900
 the opposite so the good this pool so I 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.720
 know that the opponents are going to be 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:24.940
 behind me I 'm going here I'm you 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:28.380
 see reason they have however in 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:31.449
 this area that I have that I surrounded 

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:33.280
 since we were more rated 

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:36.639
 bricks what I call the bric it's 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:38.889
 the building that fell yesterday month there a 

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:40.630
 very important building for the p2 of the 

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:42.910
 brick we can very easily before 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:45.280
 good spoon there are teams that 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:46.539
 try to push blue too that's 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:48.190
 a way to do but you have to know 

00:04:46.539 --> 00:04:48.430
 that when you push on one side or 

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:51.220
 the other 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:53.320
 also shot the shoulder must try to 

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:55.509
 go to many more times and each of 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:58.000
 our side is more at risk than 

00:04:55.509 --> 00:04:59.250
 thing we are more likely to be 

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.810
 kill everyone on our side 

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:02.889
 so here's the point there g 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:05.050
 middle one tries to trick it's from 

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:06.250
 back off just like my teammates one 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:08.199
 try to back off to really keep 

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:10.690
 the the spoon down we absolutely do not want 

00:05:08.199 --> 00:05:13.150
 that we that our enemies this tire to the good 

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:15.370
 spot for p2 we can really here 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:17.919
 we play EDL from far we stay far 

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:19.210
 leave then let the point the 

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:21.430
 second Cazerians it does not matter the 

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:24.370
 just admit it my teammates simply 

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:25.780
 placed well for the for the next I 

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:28.030
 know it can happen or blue or view 

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:29.710
 middle so here we have more than we have 

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:31.210
 more than doubled to know that if we get 

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:34.330
 Shit it's not dramatic 

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:35.440
 normally there we lost the spoon it's 

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:38.580
 to say that our enemies is moving towards the 

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:40.470
 right so that we 

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:43.199
 but two blue hat alliances so the 

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:45.120
 bad mind a bit more advanced than 

00:05:43.199 --> 00:05:46.919
 the one I surrounded because I was good 

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:47.909
 placed and that the enemies are of course 

00:05:46.919 --> 00:05:49.949
 the right they are not yet in our 

00:05:47.909 --> 00:05:53.189
 hen see they have not taken the 

00:05:49.949 --> 00:05:56.069
 spoon they make that it's off the wall 

00:05:53.189 --> 00:05:58.039
 brick to the hen romance and here and there 

00:05:56.069 --> 00:06:01.919
 we took over nespouls so he repressed 

00:05:58.039 --> 00:06:03.659
 heroes puno bad faith that I had 

00:06:01.919 --> 00:06:05.699
 noted at the garage level 

00:06:03.659 --> 00:06:07.110
 so that's very important there I 

00:06:05.699 --> 00:06:08.669
 see that there are none of my enemies who 

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:09.960
 are none of my forgiving allies who are 

00:06:08.669 --> 00:06:11.460
 in a good way and so my enemies 

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:11.849
 risk of landing but it's the end 

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:14.699
 Of the game 

00:06:11.849 --> 00:06:16.680
 you really have to think about looking at the 

00:06:14.699 --> 00:06:19.289
 placement of all our teammates for 

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:20.759
 try to anticipate the spu leaves 

00:06:19.289 --> 00:06:24.090
 that an opponent simply and has 

00:06:20.759 --> 00:06:25.259
 really a game a spoon game a shot 

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:26.370
 in response 

00:06:25.259 --> 00:06:27.240
 as soon as we kill them we know they 

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:29.940
 change our side it really takes 

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:31.919
 pay attention to that so that's it I hope 

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:33.919
 that this video will help you like for 

00:06:31.919 --> 00:06:35.909
 standoff i'm going to do the other maps 

00:06:33.919 --> 00:06:38.009
 the other maps decerto so here we go 

00:06:35.909 --> 00:06:39.120
 especially as usual do not hesitate to 

00:06:38.009 --> 00:06:40.830
 leave your comments and your 

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:42.779
 reviews via social networks 

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:45.199
 and I tell you the next video 

00:06:42.779 --> 00:06:45.199
 Hi
