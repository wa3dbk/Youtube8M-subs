products<00:00:27.680> anyway

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:28.670 
products anyway

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:31.270 
products anyway
as<00:00:28.730> you<00:00:29.660> may<00:00:29.840> know<00:00:30.050> there's<00:00:30.350> a<00:00:30.440> new<00:00:30.590> regulation

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:42.460 
implies in many different steps so be in
brief<00:00:39.950> there<00:00:40.490> are<00:00:40.550> three<00:00:41.090> steps<00:00:41.390> for<00:00:42.110> EU

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:42.470 
brief there are three steps for EU

brief there are three steps for EU
Cosmetic<00:00:43.310> registration<00:00:44.180> the<00:00:44.750> first<00:00:45.020> one<00:00:45.320> is

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:45.920 
Cosmetic registration the first one is

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.060 
Cosmetic registration the first one is
that<00:00:46.340> you<00:00:46.940> need<00:00:47.239> to<00:00:48.050> prepare<00:00:48.290> a<00:00:48.650> document

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:49.070 
that you need to prepare a document

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:51.040 
that you need to prepare a document
which<00:00:49.730> is<00:00:49.760> called<00:00:50.150> a<00:00:50.239> cosmetic<00:00:50.780> product

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:51.050 
which is called a cosmetic product

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:53.620 
which is called a cosmetic product
safety<00:00:51.530> report<00:00:51.980> or<00:00:52.520> sometimes<00:00:53.090> called<00:00:53.420> a

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:53.630 
safety report or sometimes called a

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:57.280 
safety report or sometimes called a
dossier<00:00:54.350> or<00:00:54.649> a<00:00:55.000> PIF<00:00:56.030> for<00:00:56.660> product<00:00:57.140> information

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:57.290 
dossier or a PIF for product information

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:02.770 
dossier or a PIF for product information
file<00:00:58.690> so<00:00:59.690> this<00:01:00.590> document<00:01:00.950> is<00:01:01.430> a<00:01:01.489> big<00:01:02.120> documents

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:02.780 
file so this document is a big documents

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.580

each of the raw material the certificate
of<00:01:15.680> analysis<00:01:16.340> of<00:01:16.549> each<00:01:16.820> of<00:01:17.120> the<00:01:17.299> raw<00:01:17.540> material

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:18.280 
of analysis of each of the raw material

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.670 
of analysis of each of the raw material
the<00:01:19.280> name<00:01:19.640> of<00:01:19.880> the<00:01:20.030> suppliers<00:01:20.510> of<00:01:20.720> each<00:01:21.229> of<00:01:21.470> the

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:24.229 
raw materials the manufacturing process

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:27.160 
raw materials the manufacturing process
and<00:01:24.380> on<00:01:24.979> and<00:01:25.250> on<00:01:25.400> so<00:01:25.850> there's<00:01:26.510> a<00:01:26.630> lot<00:01:26.930> of

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.170 
and on and on so there's a lot of

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:31.300 
and on and on so there's a lot of
documents<00:01:27.860> in<00:01:28.010> that<00:01:28.070> part<00:01:29.470> we<00:01:30.470> also<00:01:30.680> need<00:01:31.130> to

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
documents in that part we also need to

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:33.870 
documents in that part we also need to
prepare<00:01:31.520> a<00:01:31.940> label<00:01:32.930> with<00:01:33.140> you<00:01:33.320> to<00:01:33.619> make<00:01:33.799> sure

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:33.880 
prepare a label with you to make sure

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.500 
prepare a label with you to make sure
that<00:01:34.880> the<00:01:35.450> label<00:01:35.810> is<00:01:36.260> EU<00:01:36.890> compliant<00:01:37.549> and<00:01:38.150> so

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:38.510 
that the label is EU compliant and so

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:41.620 
that the label is EU compliant and so
legal<00:01:39.350> to<00:01:39.560> market<00:01:40.010> in<00:01:40.280> Europe<00:01:40.640> if<00:01:41.180> you<00:01:41.270> are<00:01:41.600> a

legal to market in Europe if you are a

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:43.410 
legal to market in Europe if you are a
u.s.<00:01:42.200> manufacturer

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:43.420 
u.s. manufacturer

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:46.840 
u.s. manufacturer
there<00:01:44.420> are<00:01:44.540> about<00:01:44.659> 90%<00:01:45.380> of<00:01:45.860> the<00:01:46.159> chances<00:01:46.640> that

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:46.850 
there are about 90% of the chances that

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:49.690 
there are about 90% of the chances that
your<00:01:47.450> current<00:01:47.840> US<00:01:48.229> label<00:01:48.650> will<00:01:49.159> not<00:01:49.430> be

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:49.700 
your current US label will not be

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.110 
your current US label will not be
accepted<00:01:50.390> in<00:01:50.570> Europe

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:51.120 
accepted in Europe

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:54.890 
accepted in Europe
we'll<00:01:51.330> be<00:01:51.540> some<00:01:51.900> corrections<00:01:52.890> to<00:01:53.400> be<00:01:53.550> done<00:01:53.900> so

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:54.900 
we'll be some corrections to be done so

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.410 
we'll be some corrections to be done so
so<00:01:55.500> that<00:01:55.740> was<00:01:55.950> the<00:01:56.130> first<00:01:56.460> step<00:01:56.760> this<00:01:57.210> is<00:01:57.270> the

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
so that was the first step this is the

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.770 
so that was the first step this is the
big<00:01:57.810> part<00:01:58.110> of<00:01:58.320> the<00:01:58.380> world<00:01:58.940> once<00:01:59.940> we<00:02:00.240> have<00:02:00.480> this

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
big part of the world once we have this

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.790 
big part of the world once we have this
you<00:02:01.440> need<00:02:01.680> to<00:02:02.100> probably<00:02:02.490> revise<00:02:03.420> your<00:02:03.800> label

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:04.800 
you need to probably revise your label

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:08.330 
you need to probably revise your label
so<00:02:05.070> that<00:02:05.250> it<00:02:05.430> will<00:02:05.610> be<00:02:05.790> EU<00:02:06.240> compliant<00:02:06.960> and<00:02:07.340> then

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
so that it will be EU compliant and then

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.470 
so that it will be EU compliant and then
we<00:02:08.760> can<00:02:09.060> do<00:02:09.540> the<00:02:09.750> second<00:02:10.170> step<00:02:10.260> which<00:02:10.890> is<00:02:10.920> the

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
we can do the second step which is the

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.030 
we can do the second step which is the
notification<00:02:12.480> of<00:02:12.630> your<00:02:12.660> product<00:02:13.260> this<00:02:13.830> is

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
done on the new notification system

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.710 
done on the new notification system
system<00:02:18.030> which<00:02:18.690> is<00:02:19.580> from<00:02:20.580> the<00:02:20.790> EU<00:02:21.120> government
