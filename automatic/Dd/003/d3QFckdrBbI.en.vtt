00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:39.940 
going to be in this set up you're going

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:41.910 
going to be in this set up you're going
to<00:00:40.000> be<00:00:40.090> using<00:00:40.239> the<00:00:40.630> UAB<00:00:40.960> and<00:00:41.140> the<00:00:41.440> counter<00:00:41.739> UAV

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:41.920 
to be using the UAB and the counter UAV

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.250 
to be using the UAB and the counter UAV
if<00:00:42.340> you<00:00:42.489> want<00:00:42.700> to<00:00:42.850> use<00:00:43.030> the<00:00:43.269> orbital<00:00:43.719> vsat<00:00:43.870> feel

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:44.260 
if you want to use the orbital vsat feel

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.200 
if you want to use the orbital vsat feel
free<00:00:44.379> to<00:00:44.500> do<00:00:44.620> it<00:00:44.649> this<00:00:45.219> setup<00:00:45.640> is<00:00:45.789> a<00:00:45.850> little<00:00:46.120> bit

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:46.210 
free to do it this setup is a little bit

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:47.729 
free to do it this setup is a little bit
harder<00:00:46.480> to<00:00:46.600> use<00:00:46.809> so<00:00:47.079> I<00:00:47.109> didn't<00:00:47.440> want<00:00:47.559> to<00:00:47.649> use

00:00:47.729 --> 00:00:47.739 
harder to use so I didn't want to use

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:48.959 
harder to use so I didn't want to use
something<00:00:47.769> those<00:00:48.309> give<00:00:48.460> me<00:00:48.519> too<00:00:48.640> hard<00:00:48.850> to

00:00:48.959 --> 00:00:48.969 
something those give me too hard to

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:50.729 
something those give me too hard to
reach<00:00:49.149> orbital<00:00:49.719> vsat<00:00:49.839> takes<00:00:50.289> quite<00:00:50.469> a<00:00:50.530> bit<00:00:50.620> of

00:00:50.729 --> 00:00:50.739 
reach orbital vsat takes quite a bit of

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:52.829 
reach orbital vsat takes quite a bit of
time<00:00:50.980> to<00:00:51.370> get<00:00:51.789> in<00:00:52.000> quite<00:00:52.269> a<00:00:52.300> bit<00:00:52.420> of<00:00:52.480> skill

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:52.839 
time to get in quite a bit of skill

00:00:52.839 --> 00:00:55.829 
time to get in quite a bit of skill
running<00:00:53.559> around<00:00:53.649> with<00:00:53.920> a<00:00:54.039> handgun<00:00:54.339> etc<00:00:54.910> so<00:00:55.390> if

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:55.839 
running around with a handgun etc so if

00:00:55.839 --> 00:00:56.669 
running around with a handgun etc so if
you<00:00:55.960> don't<00:00:56.109> feel<00:00:56.199> like<00:00:56.230> you<00:00:56.379> can<00:00:56.410> get<00:00:56.589> an

00:00:56.669 --> 00:00:56.679 
you don't feel like you can get an

00:00:56.679 --> 00:00:58.169 
you don't feel like you can get an
orbital<00:00:57.010> vsat<00:00:57.129> don't<00:00:57.489> do<00:00:57.609> it<00:00:57.699> I<00:00:57.820> didn't<00:00:58.089> feel

00:00:58.169 --> 00:00:58.179 
orbital vsat don't do it I didn't feel

00:00:58.179 --> 00:00:59.400 
orbital vsat don't do it I didn't feel
like<00:00:58.239> I<00:00:58.420> could<00:00:58.449> do<00:00:58.690> it<00:00:58.809> since<00:00:58.960> I<00:00:59.050> normally

00:00:59.400 --> 00:00:59.410 
like I could do it since I normally

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:00.779 
like I could do it since I normally
don't<00:00:59.530> run<00:00:59.710> this<00:00:59.829> kind<00:01:00.039> of<00:01:00.100> class<00:01:00.280> setup<00:01:00.609> so<00:01:00.730> I

00:01:00.779 --> 00:01:00.789 
don't run this kind of class setup so I

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:02.970 
don't run this kind of class setup so I
just<00:01:00.969> used<00:01:01.149> a<00:01:01.239> UAV<00:01:01.539> and<00:01:01.839> cutter<00:01:02.230> UAVs<00:01:02.620> I<00:01:02.829> could

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:02.980 
just used a UAV and cutter UAVs I could

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:04.770 
just used a UAV and cutter UAVs I could
keep<00:01:03.190> using<00:01:03.429> him<00:01:03.670> over<00:01:03.940> and<00:01:04.059> over<00:01:04.180> rinse

would recommend to use that now that's

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:58.150 
would recommend to use that now that's
really<00:03:56.959> not<00:03:57.109> leaflet<00:03:57.530> or<00:03:57.560> the<00:03:57.709> tactical

you smoke grenades and this one I was
using<00:04:01.160> concussion<00:04:01.790> just<00:04:01.970> because<00:04:02.180> I<00:04:02.269> don't

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:02.450 
using concussion just because I don't

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:04.059

have<00:04:02.630> the<00:04:02.750> smoke<00:04:03.049> grenade<00:04:03.350> but<00:04:03.859> i<00:04:03.920> would

00:04:04.059 --> 00:04:04.069 
have the smoke grenade but i would

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:05.379
