00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:06.759
 the texts of the ancients describe a 

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:09.549
 artifact they called shovel 

00:00:06.759 --> 00:00:12.010
 amplification I'm convinced that 

00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:15.400
 this object is vital to access the 

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:18.009
 energy of the elementary stones by 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:20.259
 misfortune in our excavations not 

00:00:18.009 --> 00:00:23.199
 we have managed to breathe the rod or the 

00:00:20.259 --> 00:00:25.449
 stones I feel that despite everything we must 

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:27.189
 keep going I have drawn some plans 

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:29.409
 to create replicas of the rods to 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:31.989
 from descriptions found in the 

00:00:29.409 --> 00:00:36.150
 main camera of arrenta faith that 

00:00:31.989 --> 00:00:36.150
 begins its manufacture immediately 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:45.550
 the investigation of element 115 follows 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:48.100
 throwing unexpected results the 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:50.500
 conversion process creates fields of 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:53.440
 localized energy that look like 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:55.660
 function as portals of those that 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:58.720
 objects of indeterminate origin arise 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:01.750
 my hypothesis as strange as I can 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:04.330
 It seems that this transfer of 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:07.600
 matter could be happening through 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:09.460
 of spacetime I think the answer 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.490
 could be in the stones rubrics 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:14.890
 broken on the mound the 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:17.200
 channeling enough energy from 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:20.970
 the conversion generators to this 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.970
 place may be fruitful 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:29.130
 it was pure coincidence that we opened the 

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:31.289
 Seal the main chamber 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.899
 repeated attempts to use force 

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:36.270
 gross were ineffective and left 

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:39.390
 our exhausted and frustrated men 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.880
 one with the idea of ​​easing one's attention 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.140
 of the soldiers brought a gramophone to the 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:47.800
 camera 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.940
 or of artists known as the south his 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:51.040
 place 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:53.590
 to our amazement while 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:54.400
 we listened to the first bars of the 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.340
 music 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:59.920
 the seal started to open I can not 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:03.010
 avoid wondering if there will be more 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:05.580
 recordings that reveal other areas of 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:05.580
 the catacombs 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:13.739
 the girl's voice calls me with more 

00:02:10.409 --> 00:02:15.840
 frequency that never at the beginning only 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:18.750
 he talked about his imprisonment in a kingdom 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:21.810
 mythical known as a letter now 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:24.700
 she says she is my daughter although I know that 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:27.129
 I do not have any 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:29.550
 I'm afraid I might be losing the 

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:29.550
 judgment 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:35.420
 when I woke up this morning I found out 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.760
 of the mysterious events that happened 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:40.250
 during the night the workers of the 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.620
 installation of the generators said 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:45.380
 have seen old figures that 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:47.690
 they emerged from the earth would doubt their 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:50.180
 story if it were not because of the 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:53.770
 morning many of the men were 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.770
 dead or missing 

00:02:54.409 --> 00:03:01.379
 when the 115 is channeled to the stones 

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:04.110
 ancient an energy field seems 

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:07.620
 drag unknown objects to our 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:09.440
 actually it is possible that the element 115 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:11.630
 is altering the continuum 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:14.120
 space time 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:17.330
 everything could if not an old box 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:20.450
 created pawns will bring weapons of different 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:22.760
 you were maybe even from our own 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:24.590
 future one more study is necessary 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:27.700
 exhaustive about these powerful e 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:27.700
 unpredictable forces 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:35.720
 only a madman would create a machine 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:39.800
 how is this that works with the interest of 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:42.620
 more than 115 to the ancient stones 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:44.750
 an energy time seems to crawl 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:46.940
 one month they struggle to control the 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:49.690
 generators it is possible that the element 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:49.690
 I feel
