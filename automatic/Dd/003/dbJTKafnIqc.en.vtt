just going to toss it out by the shore
you<00:03:22.470> can<00:03:22.710> cut<00:03:23.310> it<00:03:24.050> about<00:03:25.050> here<00:03:25.610> and<00:03:26.610> you<00:03:27.570> can

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
you can cut it about here and you can

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.930 
you can cut it about here and you can
make<00:03:27.870> three<00:03:28.080> but<00:03:29.070> if<00:03:29.160> you're<00:03:29.340> gonna<00:03:29.430> use<00:03:29.730> some

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
make three but if you're gonna use some

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:35.000 
make three but if you're gonna use some
weight<00:03:30.230> you<00:03:31.280> you<00:03:32.450> I'd<00:03:33.450> say<00:03:33.810> you<00:03:34.380> can<00:03:34.560> make<00:03:34.710> two

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
weight you you I'd say you can make two

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:36.380 
weight you you I'd say you can make two
from<00:03:35.310> this<00:03:35.430> if<00:03:35.610> you're<00:03:35.730> gonna<00:03:35.820> use<00:03:36.030> weight<00:03:36.270> and

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
from this if you're gonna use weight and

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:37.220 
from this if you're gonna use weight and
just<00:03:36.450> cut<00:03:36.660> it<00:03:36.690> like<00:03:36.870> that

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
just cut it like that

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.290 
just cut it like that
that's<00:03:37.740> what<00:03:37.890> I'd<00:03:37.980> probably<00:03:38.250> do<00:03:38.730> they're

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:39.300 
that's what I'd probably do they're

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:40.820 
that's what I'd probably do they're
still<00:03:39.660> small<00:03:39.960> and<00:03:40.140> everything<00:03:40.590> you<00:03:40.770> don't

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:40.830 
still small and everything you don't

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:43.940 
still small and everything you don't
have<00:03:41.010> to<00:03:41.160> worry<00:03:41.340> about<00:03:42.080> taking<00:03:43.080> up<00:03:43.350> space<00:03:43.500> so

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
have to worry about taking up space so

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:45.110 
have to worry about taking up space so
what<00:03:44.370> you're<00:03:44.520> gonna<00:03:44.580> do<00:03:44.850> is<00:03:44.970> you're<00:03:45.090> just

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
what you're gonna do is you're just

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.810 
what you're gonna do is you're just
gonna<00:03:45.330> cut<00:03:45.630> right<00:03:45.810> here<00:03:46.490> it<00:03:47.490> doesn't<00:03:47.670> matter

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:47.820 
gonna cut right here it doesn't matter

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:49.010
