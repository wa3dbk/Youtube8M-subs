basically<00:02:03.359> when<00:02:03.570> you<00:02:03.659> power<00:02:03.929> it<00:02:04.310> the<00:02:05.310> it<00:02:06.240> would

00:02:06.349 --> 00:02:06.359 
basically when you power it the it would

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:08.120 
basically when you power it the it would
actually<00:02:06.719> feel<00:02:06.869> tracks<00:02:07.229> will<00:02:07.409> by<00:02:07.530> itself<00:02:07.799> so

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.130

actually feel tracks will by itself so
if<00:02:08.399> I<00:02:08.550> just<00:02:09.440> get<00:02:10.440> some<00:02:10.740> tracks<00:02:11.400> here<00:02:11.580> where

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
if I just get some tracks here where

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.790 
if I just get some tracks here where
there<00:02:14.000> is<00:02:15.000> a<00:02:15.600> art<00:02:15.780> and<00:02:15.990> we<00:02:16.680> just<00:02:16.890> put<00:02:17.040> the<00:02:17.190> track

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
there is a art and we just put the track

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.490 
there is a art and we just put the track
there<00:02:17.980> and<00:02:18.670> as<00:02:19.150> soon<00:02:19.300> as<00:02:19.390> we<00:02:19.450> do<00:02:19.570> that<00:02:19.750> put<00:02:20.410> the

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
there and as soon as we do that put the

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
there and as soon as we do that put the
call<00:02:20.710> in<00:02:20.760> look<00:02:21.760> slowly<00:02:22.390> but<00:02:22.690> surely<00:02:23.220> it<00:02:24.220> builds

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:24.520 
call in look slowly but surely it builds

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:30.270 
call in look slowly but surely it builds
tracks<00:02:25.560> look<00:02:26.760> there<00:02:27.760> you<00:02:27.820> go<00:02:28.000> see<00:02:28.450> and<00:02:29.100> it<00:02:30.100> does

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
tracks look there you go see and it does

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.780 
tracks look there you go see and it does
that<00:02:30.520> until<00:02:31.300> it<00:02:31.330> can't<00:02:31.960> go<00:02:32.110> anywhere<00:02:32.470> and<00:02:33.190> yet

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
that until it can't go anywhere and yet

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:37.650 
that until it can't go anywhere and yet
on<00:02:33.940> to<00:02:34.060> the<00:02:34.150> next<00:02:34.330> one<00:02:34.420> this<00:02:35.110> is<00:02:35.290> a<00:02:36.600> this<00:02:37.600> is

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660 
on to the next one this is a this is

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:40.020 
on to the next one this is a this is
like<00:02:38.020> this<00:02:38.260> but<00:02:38.710> it<00:02:38.890> actually<00:02:39.040> destroys<00:02:39.670> box

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
like this but it actually destroys box

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:44.130 
like this but it actually destroys box
in<00:02:40.210> front<00:02:40.240> of<00:02:40.540> it<00:02:40.690> so<00:02:41.380> if<00:02:41.500> i<00:02:41.590> go<00:02:41.620> here<00:02:41.830> I'll<00:02:43.140> get

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
in front of it so if i go here I'll get

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:49.670 
in front of it so if i go here I'll get
some<00:02:44.380> more<00:02:44.580> minecart<00:02:46.950> put<00:02:47.950> that<00:02:48.100> in<00:02:48.220> there<00:02:48.400> and

that and the next one is a it's an

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:43.710 
that and the next one is a it's an
engine<00:03:42.070> one<00:03:42.250> but<00:03:42.880> you<00:03:43.000> know<00:03:43.120> it<00:03:43.270> it's<00:03:43.540> just

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:43.720 
engine one but you know it it's just

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:44.970 
engine one but you know it it's just
like<00:03:43.900> a<00:03:43.930> minecart<00:03:44.440> but<00:03:44.709> it's<00:03:44.860> actually

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:44.980 
like a minecart but it's actually

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:48.180 
like a minecart but it's actually
powered<00:03:45.520> so<00:03:45.730> you<00:03:45.820> don't<00:03:46.000> need<00:03:46.120> to<00:03:46.980> do<00:03:47.980> anything

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:48.190 
powered so you don't need to do anything

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:50.790 
powered so you don't need to do anything
so<00:03:48.580> you<00:03:48.640> can<00:03:48.970> mount<00:03:49.120> it<00:03:49.420> and<00:03:49.570> then<00:03:50.350> you<00:03:50.470> can<00:03:50.650> put

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:50.800 
so you can mount it and then you can put

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:54.210 
so you can mount it and then you can put
your<00:03:50.920> fuel<00:03:51.430> in<00:03:51.580> and<00:03:51.760> you're<00:03:51.940> off<00:03:53.040> yeah<00:03:54.040> so

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:54.220 
your fuel in and you're off yeah so

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:57.810 
your fuel in and you're off yeah so
that's<00:03:54.400> pretty<00:03:54.580> cool<00:03:54.670> and<00:03:56.430> the<00:03:57.430> next<00:03:57.610> one<00:03:57.790> is

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:57.820 
that's pretty cool and the next one is

00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:59.190 
that's pretty cool and the next one is
exactly<00:03:58.390> the<00:03:58.510> same<00:03:58.660> but<00:03:58.840> you<00:03:59.020> can<00:03:59.110> actually

00:03:59.190 --> 00:03:59.200 
exactly the same but you can actually

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.210 
exactly the same but you can actually
control<00:03:59.830> there<00:04:00.070> we<00:04:00.730> go<00:04:00.940> you<00:04:01.150> can<00:04:01.300> mount<00:04:01.480> it<00:04:01.780> and

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
control there we go you can mount it and

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:07.350 
control there we go you can mount it and
then<00:04:03.220> put<00:04:03.430> a<00:04:03.580> few<00:04:03.820> min<00:04:04.110> stop<00:04:05.110> stop<00:04:06.270> with<00:04:07.270> your

00:05:57.329 --> 00:05:57.339 
corn this is a TNT minecart it's

00:05:57.339 --> 00:05:59.579 
corn this is a TNT minecart it's
basically<00:05:57.639> you<00:05:57.849> can<00:05:58.000> push<00:05:58.240> it<00:05:58.270> and<00:05:58.930> then<00:05:59.319> want
