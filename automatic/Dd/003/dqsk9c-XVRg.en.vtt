Photography<00:01:19.440> begins<00:01:19.800> with<00:01:20.010> a<00:01:20.040> world<00:01:20.370> that's

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
Photography begins with a world that's

Photography begins with a world that's
perhaps<00:01:21.450> over<00:01:22.110> full<00:01:22.440> and<00:01:23.870> needs<00:01:24.870> to<00:01:25.080> sort<00:01:25.290> out

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
perhaps over full and needs to sort out

perhaps over full and needs to sort out
from<00:01:25.830> that<00:01:25.860> world<00:01:26.190> what's<00:01:26.550> meaningful<00:01:26.760> I

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:29.390 
from that world what's meaningful I

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:31.220 
from that world what's meaningful I
think<00:01:30.390> there<00:01:30.480> are<00:01:30.510> number<00:01:30.750> of<00:01:30.780> ways<00:01:30.930> you<00:01:31.110> can

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:31.230 
think there are number of ways you can

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:33.290 
think there are number of ways you can
speak<00:01:31.500> about<00:01:31.650> what<00:01:32.490> is<00:01:32.610> the<00:01:32.700> subject<00:01:33.120> of<00:01:33.210> the
