stack up and farm overall their lineup

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:33.770 
stack up and farm overall their lineup
is<00:03:31.260> just<00:03:31.440> much<00:03:31.709> much<00:03:32.280> harder<00:03:32.550> to<00:03:32.849> to<00:03:33.540> really

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
is just much much harder to to really

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.110 
is just much much harder to to really
just<00:03:33.959> use<00:03:34.260> effectively<00:03:34.800> just<00:03:35.519> small<00:03:35.760> mistakes

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
just use effectively just small mistakes

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
it wasn't enough to just handle how like

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.199 
it wasn't enough to just handle how like
I<00:03:47.010> said<00:03:47.160> this<00:03:47.400> guy<00:03:47.519> whenever<00:03:47.790> he<00:03:47.880> plays<00:03:48.060> his

gyro<00:03:48.390> not<00:03:49.350> just<00:03:49.530> he<00:03:49.590> just<00:03:49.620> farm<00:03:50.010> he<00:03:50.390> runs<00:03:51.390> at

00:03:51.559 --> 00:03:51.569 
gyro not just he just farm he runs at

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:54.350 
gyro not just he just farm he runs at
