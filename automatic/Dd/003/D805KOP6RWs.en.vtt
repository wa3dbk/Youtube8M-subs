and<00:00:10.130> I<00:00:11.130> guess<00:00:11.460> YouTube<00:00:11.940> decided<00:00:12.480> I<00:00:12.570> didn't

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840

and I guess YouTube decided I didn't
need<00:00:12.929> anymore<00:00:13.290> for<00:00:13.590> no<00:00:13.740> apparent<00:00:13.860> reason<00:00:14.219> and

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
go without the VM you think oh it won't

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.090 
go without the VM you think oh it won't
let<00:02:33.210> me<00:02:33.270> play<00:02:35.060> now<00:02:36.090> the<00:02:36.870> bug<00:02:37.260> I<00:02:37.410> have<00:02:37.650> with<00:02:37.980> this

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
let me play now the bug I have with this

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:39.590 
let me play now the bug I have with this
game<00:02:38.280> and<00:02:38.460> a<00:02:38.490> lot<00:02:38.580> of<00:02:38.610> people<00:02:38.970> apparently<00:02:39.240> have

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
game and a lot of people apparently have

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.410 
game and a lot of people apparently have
is<00:02:39.840> that<00:02:40.080> if<00:02:40.200> you<00:02:40.350> press<00:02:40.650> the<00:02:40.830> gas<00:02:41.360> but<00:02:42.360> I

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
is that if you press the gas but I

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.450 
is that if you press the gas but I
actually<00:02:42.570> because<00:02:43.110> if<00:02:43.290> I<00:02:43.500> have<00:02:43.740> this<00:02:43.920> natively

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:44.460 
actually because if I have this natively

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:51.830 
actually because if I have this natively
it<00:02:45.030> detects<00:02:45.420> your<00:02:45.660> um<00:02:46.460> your<00:02:47.460> controls<00:02:50.840> it

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
it detects your um your controls it

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.390 
it detects your um your controls it
doesn't<00:02:52.140> let<00:02:52.260> you<00:02:52.320> map<00:02:52.530> them<00:02:52.740> it<00:02:52.890> just<00:02:52.920> detects

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
doesn't let you map them it just detects

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:58.370 
doesn't let you map them it just detects
them<00:02:53.700> right<00:02:53.940> now<00:02:54.150> so<00:02:54.480> I<00:02:55.730> got<00:02:56.730> a<00:02:56.760> uh<00:02:57.050> it<00:02:58.050> doesn't

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
them right now so I got a uh it doesn't

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.800 
them right now so I got a uh it doesn't
map<00:02:58.530> them<00:02:58.770> very<00:02:58.980> well<00:02:59.220> either<00:02:59.540> that's<00:03:00.540> why<00:03:00.720> I

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
map them very well either that's why I

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:02.660 
map them very well either that's why I
have<00:03:00.990> to<00:03:01.110> go<00:03:01.230> into<00:03:01.380> the<00:03:01.500> options<00:03:02.040> and<00:03:02.340> actually

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
have to go into the options and actually

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:05.780 
have to go into the options and actually
change<00:03:03.200> some<00:03:04.200> of<00:03:04.230> the<00:03:04.380> configurations<00:03:04.980> on<00:03:05.700> the

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
change some of the configurations on the

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:13.760 
change some of the configurations on the
controller<00:03:06.150> so<00:03:12.080> then<00:03:13.080> you<00:03:13.170> could<00:03:13.320> touch<00:03:13.500> mat

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:13.770 
controller so then you could touch mat

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:15.410 
controller so then you could touch mat
but<00:03:13.950> it's<00:03:14.100> probably<00:03:14.280> better<00:03:14.610> just<00:03:15.210> you'll

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
but it's probably better just you'll

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.570 
but it's probably better just you'll
have<00:03:15.540> the<00:03:15.660> on-screen<00:03:16.050> controls<00:03:16.580> because

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580 
have the on-screen controls because

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:19.160 
have the on-screen controls because
you'll<00:03:17.730> didn't<00:03:18.090> get<00:03:18.330> have<00:03:18.570> all<00:03:18.720> the<00:03:18.840> controls

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
you'll didn't get have all the controls

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:23.840 
you'll didn't get have all the controls
you<00:03:19.230> won't<00:03:19.410> have<00:03:19.470> to<00:03:19.620> go<00:03:19.740> through<00:03:19.950> this<00:03:22.070> so<00:03:23.070> I'm

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:23.850 
you won't have to go through this so I'm

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:25.550 
you won't have to go through this so I'm
gonna<00:03:24.000> go<00:03:24.150> back<00:03:24.420> and<00:03:24.450> make<00:03:24.870> sure<00:03:24.900> this<00:03:25.110> is<00:03:25.260> gas

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
gonna go back and make sure this is gas

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:34.240 
gonna go back and make sure this is gas
and<00:03:26.120> then<00:03:27.120> this<00:03:27.300> is<00:03:27.510> going<00:03:27.810> to<00:03:27.990> be<00:03:28.230> brake<00:03:31.610> okay

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:34.250 
and then this is going to be brake okay

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:36.410 
and then this is going to be brake okay
if<00:03:35.250> they<00:03:35.400> get<00:03:35.610> this<00:03:35.730> working<00:03:36.090> I<00:03:36.180> don't<00:03:36.240> know

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
if they get this working I don't know

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:39.140 
if they get this working I don't know
you<00:03:36.540> may<00:03:36.690> want<00:03:36.720> to<00:03:37.290> do<00:03:37.530> that<00:03:37.709> anyways<00:03:38.250> once<00:03:38.970> you

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
you may want to do that anyways once you

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:40.670 
you may want to do that anyways once you
get<00:03:39.330> you<00:03:39.510> know<00:03:39.630> BM<00:03:39.900> you<00:03:40.020> support<00:03:40.380> shouldn't

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
get you know BM you support shouldn't

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:45.650 
get you know BM you support shouldn't
have<00:03:40.770> to<00:03:40.860> do<00:03:40.980> that<00:03:41.130> but<00:03:41.790> on<00:03:42.330> the<00:03:44.450> what<00:03:45.450> you<00:03:45.540> call

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
have to do that but on the what you call

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:49.280 
have to do that but on the what you call
on<00:03:45.900> the<00:03:46.080> Dreamcast<00:03:46.650> the<00:03:47.540> triggers<00:03:48.540> are<00:03:48.780> analog

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
on the Dreamcast the triggers are analog

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:53.620 
on the Dreamcast the triggers are analog
and<00:03:49.590> not<00:03:50.370> digital<00:03:50.820> these<00:03:50.970> are<00:03:51.180> digital<00:03:51.570> so

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:53.630 
and not digital these are digital so

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:57.230 
and not digital these are digital so
it's<00:03:54.740> it<00:03:55.740> may<00:03:55.980> cause<00:03:56.280> a<00:03:56.310> problem<00:03:56.610> I<00:03:56.910> don't<00:03:56.940> know

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:57.240 
it's it may cause a problem I don't know

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:01.010 
it's it may cause a problem I don't know
may<00:03:57.570> not<00:03:57.780> I<00:03:58.220> may<00:03:59.220> be<00:03:59.250> full<00:03:59.670> of<00:03:59.820> it<00:03:59.990> may<00:04:00.990> be

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:01.020 
may not I may be full of it may be

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:02.990 
may not I may be full of it may be
perfectly<00:04:01.320> fine<00:04:01.800> but<00:04:02.250> it<00:04:02.400> may<00:04:02.490> just<00:04:02.670> be<00:04:02.730> better

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
perfectly fine but it may just be better

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.610 
perfectly fine but it may just be better
if<00:04:03.120> you<00:04:03.330> maps<00:04:03.540> it<00:04:03.720> to<00:04:03.870> different<00:04:04.020> buttons<00:04:04.470> or

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
if you maps it to different buttons or

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:09.920 
if you maps it to different buttons or
something<00:04:05.000> um<00:04:07.940> take<00:04:08.940> a<00:04:08.970> course<00:04:09.360> setting

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.930 
something um take a course setting

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:13.490 
something um take a course setting
course<00:04:10.200> we'll<00:04:10.560> go<00:04:10.739> with<00:04:10.920> that<00:04:11.239> and<00:04:12.380> there<00:04:13.380> are

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.500 
course we'll go with that and there are

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.920 
course we'll go with that and there are
glitches<00:04:13.770> in<00:04:14.100> the<00:04:14.190> game<00:04:14.540> there<00:04:15.540> are<00:04:15.690> some

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:15.930 
glitches in the game there are some

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:17.840 
glitches in the game there are some
graphically<00:04:16.799> like<00:04:17.010> right<00:04:17.340> here<00:04:17.580> you<00:04:17.700> can<00:04:17.820> see

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:17.850 
graphically like right here you can see

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:21.730 
graphically like right here you can see
there's<00:04:18.180> a<00:04:18.270> graphical<00:04:18.780> glitch<00:04:19.020> right<00:04:19.230> there

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:21.740 

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:24.740 

but<00:04:22.740> the<00:04:22.830> game<00:04:22.950> runs<00:04:23.160> smoothly<00:04:23.550> and<00:04:24.360> I'm<00:04:24.570> sure

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:24.750 
but the game runs smoothly and I'm sure

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:26.250 
but the game runs smoothly and I'm sure
with<00:04:25.020> some<00:04:25.050> updates

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:26.260 
with some updates

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.770 
with some updates
would<00:04:26.380> be<00:04:26.500> perfectly<00:04:26.950> fine<00:04:27.630> I've<00:04:28.630> been

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:28.780 
would be perfectly fine I've been

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:30.930 
would be perfectly fine I've been
waiting<00:04:29.050> for<00:04:29.230> a<00:04:29.260> Dreamcast<00:04:29.800> emulator<00:04:30.340> on<00:04:30.700> the

waiting for a Dreamcast emulator on the
Android<00:04:31.210> forever<00:04:31.570> I<00:04:31.840> like<00:04:32.140> to<00:04:32.290> have<00:04:32.550> certain

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:33.550

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:37.510 
so here we already see all this

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:42.810

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:48.660 
going on here you see it's doing that
it's<00:04:46.600> literally<00:04:47.110> as<00:04:47.650> if<00:04:47.710> I'm<00:04:47.980> pressing<00:04:48.400> brake

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:48.670 
it's literally as if I'm pressing brake

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:51.780 
it's literally as if I'm pressing brake
and<00:04:48.910> gas<00:04:49.030> at<00:04:49.300> the<00:04:49.390> same<00:04:49.450> time<00:04:50.580> and<00:04:51.580> the<00:04:51.640> only

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:51.790 
and gas at the same time and the only

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:55.260 
and gas at the same time and the only
way<00:04:51.940> I<00:04:51.970> can<00:04:52.150> speed<00:04:52.480> up<00:04:53.580> its<00:04:54.580> normally<00:04:55.000> if<00:04:55.150> I

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:55.270 
way I can speed up its normally if I

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:59.430 
way I can speed up its normally if I
really<00:04:55.810> rapidly<00:04:56.710> press<00:04:57.330> the<00:04:58.330> B<00:04:58.750> button

00:04:59.430 --> 00:04:59.440 
really rapidly press the B button

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:03.840 
really rapidly press the B button
I<00:05:00.300> also<00:05:01.300> remap<00:05:01.750> the<00:05:01.960> B<00:05:02.170> and<00:05:02.440> the<00:05:03.130> a<00:05:03.160> I<00:05:03.310> swapped

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:03.850 
I also remap the B and the a I swapped

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:06.600 
I also remap the B and the a I swapped
the<00:05:04.030> B<00:05:04.210> and<00:05:04.390> the<00:05:04.450> a<00:05:04.480> and<00:05:04.630> the<00:05:05.050> C<00:05:05.080> and<00:05:05.290> D<00:05:05.610> buttons

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:06.610 
the B and the a and the C and D buttons

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:10.350 
the B and the a and the C and D buttons
because<00:05:07.090> they<00:05:07.410> don't<00:05:08.820> you<00:05:09.820> know<00:05:09.850> they<00:05:10.330> don't

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:10.360 
because they don't you know they don't

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:16.110 
because they don't you know they don't
map<00:05:11.200> properly<00:05:11.890> or<00:05:12.460> something<00:05:13.440> so<00:05:14.760> I'm<00:05:15.760> still

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:16.120 
map properly or something so I'm still

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:20.010 
map properly or something so I'm still
not<00:05:16.270> going<00:05:16.480> fast<00:05:16.810> enough<00:05:17.430> but<00:05:18.430> you<00:05:18.850> know<00:05:19.020> it's

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:20.020 
not going fast enough but you know it's

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:23.520 
not going fast enough but you know it's
a<00:05:20.500> lot<00:05:21.280> better<00:05:21.580> it's<00:05:21.940> just<00:05:22.090> not<00:05:22.420> it's<00:05:23.320> still

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:23.530 
a lot better it's just not it's still

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:26.250 
a lot better it's just not it's still
really<00:05:23.890> hard<00:05:24.190> to<00:05:24.370> play<00:05:24.670> and<00:05:25.360> if<00:05:25.570> I<00:05:25.660> let<00:05:25.870> go<00:05:26.110> of

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:26.260 
really hard to play and if I let go of

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:27.870 
really hard to play and if I let go of
the<00:05:26.350> gas<00:05:26.560> it<00:05:26.890> does<00:05:27.070> that<00:05:27.250> again<00:05:27.550> so<00:05:27.760> you<00:05:27.820> have

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:27.880 
the gas it does that again so you have

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:32.820 
the gas it does that again so you have
to<00:05:28.030> like<00:05:28.650> rapidly<00:05:29.650> press<00:05:30.040> the<00:05:30.310> B<00:05:30.520> button<00:05:31.830> until

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:32.830 
to like rapidly press the B button until

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:41.520 
to like rapidly press the B button until
it<00:05:33.100> actually<00:05:33.580> will<00:05:33.940> give<00:05:34.120> you<00:05:34.240> the<00:05:34.390> damn<00:05:40.530> yeah

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:41.530 
it actually will give you the damn yeah

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:43.080 
it actually will give you the damn yeah
and<00:05:41.860> if<00:05:41.980> you<00:05:42.100> have<00:05:42.280> like<00:05:42.430> an<00:05:42.550> Xbox<00:05:42.970> controller

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:43.090 
and if you have like an Xbox controller

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:45.390 
and if you have like an Xbox controller
and<00:05:43.720> you're<00:05:43.810> using<00:05:43.990> it<00:05:44.260> I<00:05:44.470> found<00:05:45.010> that<00:05:45.160> if<00:05:45.250> you

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:45.400 
and you're using it I found that if you

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:49.830 
and you're using it I found that if you
just<00:05:45.850> lightly<00:05:46.420> compress<00:05:47.140> the<00:05:48.750> what's<00:05:49.750> the

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:49.840 
just lightly compress the what's the

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:54.230 
just lightly compress the what's the
McCall<00:05:50.170> it<00:05:51.210> if<00:05:52.210> you<00:05:52.420> lightly<00:05:52.720> compress<00:05:53.530> the

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:54.240 
McCall it if you lightly compress the

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:56.270 
McCall it if you lightly compress the
blah<00:05:55.240> blah<00:05:55.450> the<00:05:55.720> trigger

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:56.280 
blah blah the trigger

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:59.010 
blah blah the trigger
cuz<00:05:57.280> it's<00:05:57.490> analog<00:05:57.910> if<00:05:58.180> you<00:05:58.360> just<00:05:58.720> lightly

00:05:59.010 --> 00:05:59.020 
cuz it's analog if you just lightly

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:02.730 
cuz it's analog if you just lightly
press<00:05:59.470> it<00:05:59.910> slowly<00:06:00.910> then<00:06:01.840> you<00:06:01.990> can<00:06:02.140> get<00:06:02.380> it<00:06:02.530> to

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:02.740 
press it slowly then you can get it to

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:07.560 
press it slowly then you can get it to
actually<00:06:03.250> drive<00:06:05.340> and<00:06:06.340> stuff<00:06:06.670> like<00:06:06.910> that<00:06:07.150> and

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:07.570 
actually drive and stuff like that and

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:10.620 
actually drive and stuff like that and
then<00:06:08.320> you<00:06:08.440> can<00:06:08.560> fully<00:06:08.950> compress<00:06:09.430> it<00:06:09.670> once<00:06:10.390> it

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:10.630 
then you can fully compress it once it

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:14.420 
then you can fully compress it once it
starts<00:06:11.020> doing<00:06:11.980> all<00:06:12.130> the<00:06:12.310> gear<00:06:12.640> shifting<00:06:13.120> shit

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:14.430 
starts doing all the gear shifting shit

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:17.130 
starts doing all the gear shifting shit
but<00:06:15.430> you<00:06:16.060> will<00:06:16.180> not<00:06:16.270> be<00:06:16.480> able<00:06:16.570> to<00:06:16.690> play<00:06:16.900> this

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:17.140 
but you will not be able to play this

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:20.550 
but you will not be able to play this
properly<00:06:17.830> like<00:06:18.160> this<00:06:18.400> of<00:06:18.610> course<00:06:18.960> but<00:06:19.960> if<00:06:20.440> you

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:20.560 
properly like this of course but if you

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:23.310 
properly like this of course but if you
can<00:06:20.680> see<00:06:20.860> it<00:06:21.040> runs<00:06:21.280> really<00:06:21.520> smoothly<00:06:22.320> it's

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:23.320 
can see it runs really smoothly it's

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:24.870 
can see it runs really smoothly it's
quite<00:06:23.500> nice<00:06:23.620> I<00:06:23.770> tried<00:06:23.800> that<00:06:24.100> out<00:06:24.250> on<00:06:24.430> the<00:06:24.550> ouya

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:24.880 
quite nice I tried that out on the ouya

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:26.580 
quite nice I tried that out on the ouya
the<00:06:25.030> UE<00:06:25.150> ed<00:06:25.360> actually<00:06:25.720> does<00:06:25.930> not<00:06:26.110> have<00:06:26.170> that

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:26.590 
the UE ed actually does not have that

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:28.770 
the UE ed actually does not have that
problem<00:06:26.860> with<00:06:27.310> like<00:06:27.850> I'm<00:06:28.030> mentioning<00:06:28.480> but<00:06:28.630> the

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:28.780 
problem with like I'm mentioning but the

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:32.700 
problem with like I'm mentioning but the
Nexus<00:06:29.170> 7<00:06:29.380> does<00:06:30.030> other<00:06:31.030> devices<00:06:31.450> -<00:06:32.200> I've<00:06:32.410> known

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:32.710 
Nexus 7 does other devices - I've known

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:36.390 
Nexus 7 does other devices - I've known
Lee<00:06:32.800> had<00:06:33.040> the<00:06:33.190> Ouya<00:06:33.610> give<00:06:34.510> me<00:06:34.660> any<00:06:34.810> luck<00:06:35.170> so<00:06:35.530> you

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:36.400 
Lee had the Ouya give me any luck so you

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:38.160 
Lee had the Ouya give me any luck so you
wee<00:06:36.550> a<00:06:36.580> controller<00:06:37.060> the<00:06:37.300> only<00:06:37.450> thing<00:06:37.630> is<00:06:37.840> that

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:38.170 
wee a controller the only thing is that

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:39.390 
wee a controller the only thing is that
the<00:06:38.620> the<00:06:38.890> sky

00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:39.400 
the the sky

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:43.590 
the the sky
completely<00:06:39.820> gone<00:06:40.290> it's<00:06:41.290> black<00:06:41.680> and<00:06:42.180> the<00:06:43.180> frame

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:43.600 
completely gone it's black and the frame

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:48.540 
completely gone it's black and the frame
rates<00:06:43.870> not<00:06:44.110> as<00:06:44.380> good<00:06:46.080> so<00:06:47.080> that's<00:06:47.380> that's<00:06:48.310> the

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:48.550 
rates not as good so that's that's the

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:50.670 
rates not as good so that's that's the
trade-off<00:06:48.850> there's<00:06:49.270> no<00:06:49.449> no<00:06:50.139> perfection

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:50.680 
trade-off there's no no perfection

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:54.120 
trade-off there's no no perfection
anywhere<00:06:51.990> but<00:06:52.990> it's<00:06:53.139> an<00:06:53.229> alpha<00:06:53.530> build<00:06:53.740> so<00:06:53.949> it's

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:54.130 
anywhere but it's an alpha build so it's

00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:58.860 
anywhere but it's an alpha build so it's
quite<00:06:54.400> impressive<00:06:55.120> and<00:06:56.190> I'm<00:06:57.190> trying<00:06:58.090> to<00:06:58.270> play

00:06:58.860 --> 00:06:58.870 
quite impressive and I'm trying to play

00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:01.320 
quite impressive and I'm trying to play
but<00:06:59.229> you<00:06:59.470> know<00:06:59.560> I<00:06:59.590> can't<00:06:59.889> let<00:07:00.100> go<00:07:00.160> of<00:07:00.430> the<00:07:00.490> gas<00:07:00.729> I

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:01.330 
but you know I can't let go of the gas I

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:03.840 
but you know I can't let go of the gas I
can't<00:07:01.660> press<00:07:01.780> the<00:07:01.960> brake<00:07:02.320> properly<00:07:03.130> or<00:07:03.550> it

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:03.850 
can't press the brake properly or it

00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:05.820 
can't press the brake properly or it
will<00:07:04.060> stop<00:07:04.389> you<00:07:04.870> know<00:07:04.960> I<00:07:04.990> have<00:07:05.380> to<00:07:05.530> hold<00:07:05.650> the

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:05.830 
will stop you know I have to hold the

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:07.529 
will stop you know I have to hold the
gas<00:07:06.039> like<00:07:06.400> it's<00:07:06.580> what<00:07:07.120> the<00:07:07.210> hell<00:07:07.330> is<00:07:07.389> that

00:07:07.529 --> 00:07:07.539 
gas like it's what the hell is that
