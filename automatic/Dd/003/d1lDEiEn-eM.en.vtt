00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:03.600 
today we're at our local RC park where I

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.869 
today we're at our local RC park where I
wanted<00:00:03.899> to<00:00:04.080> try<00:00:04.560> out<00:00:04.589> a<00:00:04.799> new<00:00:04.950> modification<00:00:05.790> I

00:00:05.869 --> 00:00:05.879 
wanted to try out a new modification I

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:10.040 
wanted to try out a new modification I
made<00:00:06.060> to<00:00:06.210> my<00:00:06.359> v-22<00:00:06.870> -<00:00:08.389> someone<00:00:09.389> had<00:00:09.570> noticed

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
made to my v-22 - someone had noticed

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.660 
made to my v-22 - someone had noticed
that<00:00:10.370> the<00:00:12.349> camera<00:00:13.349> for<00:00:13.679> the<00:00:13.769> galaxy<00:00:14.280> visitor

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
that the camera for the galaxy visitor

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.120 
that the camera for the galaxy visitor
to<00:00:14.849> the<00:00:15.030> HD<00:00:15.389> camera<00:00:15.780> that<00:00:15.839> comes<00:00:16.109> with<00:00:16.320> it<00:00:16.470> was

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
to the HD camera that comes with it was

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.340 
to the HD camera that comes with it was
being<00:00:17.340> offered<00:00:17.490> on<00:00:17.789> Bangla<00:00:18.180> about<00:00:18.539> $17

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
being offered on Bangla about $17

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.260

replacing<00:00:19.770> two<00:00:19.830> cameras<00:00:20.189> and<00:00:20.460> they<00:00:21.119> also

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
replacing two cameras and they also

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.630 
replacing two cameras and they also
noticed<00:00:21.779> that<00:00:21.900> the<00:00:22.020> plug<00:00:22.289> for<00:00:22.529> it<00:00:22.590> was<00:00:23.400> very

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
noticed that the plug for it was very

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.330 
noticed that the plug for it was very
similar<00:00:23.939> if<00:00:24.150> not<00:00:24.240> the<00:00:24.449> exact<00:00:24.900> same<00:00:25.140> as<00:00:25.439> the

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
similar if not the exact same as the

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.720 
similar if not the exact same as the
plug<00:00:26.550> on<00:00:26.880> the<00:00:27.150> v-22<00:00:28.109> -<00:00:28.560> and<00:00:28.859> they<00:00:29.640> were

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
plug on the v-22 - and they were

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.770 
plug on the v-22 - and they were
wondering<00:00:30.210> if<00:00:30.599> it<00:00:30.960> could<00:00:31.109> be<00:00:31.410> used<00:00:31.710> on<00:00:32.550> a<00:00:33.120> v-22

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
wondering if it could be used on a v-22

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.470 
wondering if it could be used on a v-22
-<00:00:34.020> well<00:00:34.500> I<00:00:34.770> went<00:00:35.640> and<00:00:35.730> bought<00:00:35.880> one<00:00:35.940> and<00:00:36.390> the

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
- well I went and bought one and the

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.860 
- well I went and bought one and the
answer<00:00:36.660> to<00:00:36.870> that<00:00:36.989> is<00:00:37.230> yes<00:00:38.059> it's<00:00:39.059> pretty<00:00:39.270> much<00:00:39.420> a

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
answer to that is yes it's pretty much a

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.979 
answer to that is yes it's pretty much a
plug-and-play<00:00:40.620> I<00:00:41.280> change<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:42.780> only

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
plug-and-play I change the only

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.819 
plug-and-play I change the only
difference<00:00:43.320> being<00:00:43.620> in<00:00:43.920> that<00:00:44.129> the<00:00:45.230> cable<00:00:46.230> that

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
difference being in that the cable that

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.340 
difference being in that the cable that
comes<00:00:47.010> with<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:47.430> v-22<00:00:47.760> -<00:00:48.120> is<00:00:48.329> much<00:00:49.079> shorter

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
comes with the v-22 - is much shorter

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.160 
comes with the v-22 - is much shorter
than<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:50.280> cable<00:00:50.760> and<00:00:50.879> the<00:00:51.000> camera<00:00:51.420> that<00:00:51.989> comes

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
than the cable and the camera that comes

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.740 
than the cable and the camera that comes
with<00:00:52.469> the<00:00:52.800> v-22<00:00:53.100> -<00:00:53.460> I'm<00:00:53.730> sorry<00:00:53.879> the<00:00:54.059> cable<00:00:54.390> on

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
with the v-22 - I'm sorry the cable on

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.889 
with the v-22 - I'm sorry the cable on
the<00:00:55.050> galaxy<00:00:55.770> visitor<00:00:56.100> -<00:00:56.250> camera<00:00:56.660> because<00:00:57.660> of

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
the galaxy visitor - camera because of

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.170 
the galaxy visitor - camera because of
that<00:00:58.020> you<00:00:58.649> can't<00:00:58.949> mount<00:00:59.190> it<00:00:59.430> on<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.699> bottom<00:01:00.059> of

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
that you can't mount it on the bottom of

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.410 
that you can't mount it on the bottom of
the<00:01:00.750> quadcopter<00:01:01.469> just<00:01:02.190> won't<00:01:02.370> make<00:01:02.550> it<00:01:02.730> up<00:01:03.059> to

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
the quadcopter just won't make it up to

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.050 
the quadcopter just won't make it up to
the<00:01:03.539> circuit<00:01:03.870> board<00:01:04.080> to<00:01:04.680> do<00:01:05.189> to<00:01:05.670> do<00:01:05.820> such

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
the circuit board to do to do such

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.130 
the circuit board to do to do such
you're<00:01:06.210> going<00:01:06.330> to<00:01:06.390> have<00:01:06.479> to<00:01:06.570> mount<00:01:06.750> it<00:01:06.960> onto

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
you're going to have to mount it onto

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.060 
you're going to have to mount it onto
the<00:01:07.560> camera<00:01:07.860> on<00:01:07.979> top<00:01:08.250> of<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:09.270> quadcopter<00:01:10.070> on

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
the camera on top of the quadcopter on

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.830 
the camera on top of the quadcopter on
the<00:01:11.250> way<00:01:11.400> there's<00:01:11.939> I<00:01:12.210> guess<00:01:12.299> there's<00:01:12.630> many

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
the way there's I guess there's many

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.960 
the way there's I guess there's many
ways<00:01:12.900> you<00:01:13.200> can<00:01:13.350> do<00:01:13.530> that<00:01:13.740> each<00:01:14.670> of<00:01:14.700> you<00:01:14.909> will

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
ways you can do that each of you will

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.020 
ways you can do that each of you will
probably<00:01:15.210> come<00:01:15.360> up<00:01:15.479> with<00:01:15.600> your<00:01:15.840> own<00:01:15.869> variant

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:17.030 
probably come up with your own variant

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.420 
probably come up with your own variant
me<00:01:18.030> in<00:01:18.330> particular<00:01:18.720> I<00:01:19.140> had<00:01:19.439> an<00:01:19.560> extra<00:01:19.920> canopy

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
me in particular I had an extra canopy

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.320 
me in particular I had an extra canopy
from<00:01:21.030> a<00:01:21.180> v2<00:01:21.689> one<00:01:22.049> -<00:01:22.700> which<00:01:23.700> has<00:01:23.880> a<00:01:23.909> nice<00:01:24.150> little

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
from a v2 one - which has a nice little

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.649 
from a v2 one - which has a nice little
flat<00:01:24.600> spot<00:01:24.990> on<00:01:25.020> top<00:01:25.710> of<00:01:25.890> it<00:01:26.040> which<00:01:26.580> is<00:01:27.210> it<00:01:27.450> just

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
flat spot on top of it which is it just

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.080 
flat spot on top of it which is it just
a<00:01:27.750> perfect<00:01:28.170> angle<00:01:28.500> for<00:01:28.530> mounting<00:01:28.920> your<00:01:29.009> camera

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090 
a perfect angle for mounting your camera

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:32.030 
a perfect angle for mounting your camera
so<00:01:30.090> all<00:01:30.240> I<00:01:30.270> did<00:01:30.450> for<00:01:30.780> my<00:01:30.900> modification<00:01:31.619> was<00:01:31.799> I

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
so all I did for my modification was I

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.620 
so all I did for my modification was I
took<00:01:32.610> us<00:01:32.909> a<00:01:33.000> little<00:01:33.180> square<00:01:33.360> piece<00:01:33.600> of
