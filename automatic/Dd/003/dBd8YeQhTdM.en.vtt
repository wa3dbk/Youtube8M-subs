again so the second position of this
riff<00:05:24.620> is<00:05:25.310> all<00:05:25.820> on<00:05:26.000> the<00:05:26.030> fifth<00:05:26.300> fret<00:05:26.510> okay<00:05:27.050> and

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:28.720 
riff is all on the fifth fret okay and

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:31.630 
riff is all on the fifth fret okay and
you<00:05:29.720> can<00:05:29.900> see<00:05:30.140> my<00:05:30.470> two<00:05:30.530> fingers<00:05:31.040> are<00:05:31.220> there<00:05:31.400> on

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:31.640 
you can see my two fingers are there on

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:33.850 
you can see my two fingers are there on
the<00:05:32.360> 2nd<00:05:32.810> and<00:05:32.900> 4th<00:05:33.170> strings

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:33.860 
the 2nd and 4th strings

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:35.980 
the 2nd and 4th strings
okay<00:05:34.160> so<00:05:34.220> we're<00:05:34.490> keeping<00:05:34.760> on<00:05:35.420> the<00:05:35.780> same

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:35.990 
okay so we're keeping on the same

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:40.060 
okay so we're keeping on the same
strings<00:05:36.320> the<00:05:36.470> whole<00:05:36.590> time<00:05:37.000> and<00:05:38.800> it<00:05:39.800> sounds

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:40.070 
strings the whole time and it sounds

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:53.780 
strings the whole time and it sounds
cool

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:53.790 

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:56.790 

and<00:05:54.790> you<00:05:55.780> can<00:05:55.930> see<00:05:56.080> I<00:05:56.110> change<00:05:56.380> up<00:05:56.500> the<00:05:56.650> rhythm

00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:56.800 
and you can see I change up the rhythm

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:01.980 
and you can see I change up the rhythm
each<00:05:57.070> time<00:05:59.160> depending<00:06:00.160> on<00:06:00.580> what<00:06:01.539> suits<00:06:01.780> my

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:01.990 
each time depending on what suits my

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:06.270 
each time depending on what suits my
mood<00:06:02.020> or<00:06:02.440> what<00:06:03.220> fits<00:06:03.460> the<00:06:03.610> rhythm<00:06:03.850> best<00:06:05.280> that

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:06.280 
mood or what fits the rhythm best that

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:07.620 
mood or what fits the rhythm best that
time<00:06:06.490> around<00:06:06.639> I<00:06:06.820> kind<00:06:06.940> of<00:06:07.030> felt<00:06:07.240> like<00:06:07.300> I<00:06:07.479> was<00:06:07.600> a

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:07.630 
time around I kind of felt like I was a

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:11.730 
time around I kind of felt like I was a
little<00:06:07.840> bit<00:06:08.009> too<00:06:09.009> rushed<00:06:09.220> to<00:06:10.380> get<00:06:11.380> that<00:06:11.590> many

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:11.740 
little bit too rushed to get that many

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:16.110 
little bit too rushed to get that many
notes<00:06:11.979> in<00:06:12.160> so<00:06:12.310> I<00:06:12.370> just<00:06:12.990> get<00:06:13.990> them<00:06:14.110> together<00:06:15.120> and

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:16.120 
notes in so I just get them together and

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:19.110 
notes in so I just get them together and
that's<00:06:16.990> a<00:06:17.080> good<00:06:17.229> point<00:06:17.500> also<00:06:17.770> when<00:06:18.430> you<00:06:18.550> learn

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:19.120 
that's a good point also when you learn

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:22.260 
that's a good point also when you learn
a<00:06:19.150> riff<00:06:19.419> don't<00:06:20.139> learn<00:06:20.259> it<00:06:20.380> just<00:06:20.410> one<00:06:20.770> way<00:06:21.270> break

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:22.270 
a riff don't learn it just one way break

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:23.430 
a riff don't learn it just one way break
it<00:06:22.419> down<00:06:22.509> and<00:06:22.690> look<00:06:22.810> at<00:06:22.960> what<00:06:23.139> you're<00:06:23.259> actually

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:23.440 
it down and look at what you're actually

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:26.640 
it down and look at what you're actually
dealing<00:06:23.889> with<00:06:24.010> and<00:06:24.780> you<00:06:25.780> know<00:06:25.870> try<00:06:26.080> to<00:06:26.110> use<00:06:26.620> it

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:26.650 
dealing with and you know try to use it

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:30.450 
dealing with and you know try to use it
in<00:06:26.830> as<00:06:26.949> many<00:06:27.070> different<00:06:27.250> ways<00:06:27.430> as<00:06:27.550> you<00:06:27.729> can<00:06:29.460> so

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:30.460 
in as many different ways as you can so

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:34.170 
in as many different ways as you can so
let's<00:06:30.520> go<00:06:30.699> through<00:06:30.850> this<00:06:30.970> once<00:06:31.210> more<00:06:31.449> and<00:06:33.180> have

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:34.180 
let's go through this once more and have

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:43.320 
let's go through this once more and have
some<00:06:34.330> fun

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:43.330 

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:52.480 

and<00:06:45.220> that<00:06:46.220> time<00:06:46.570> I'm<00:06:47.570> through<00:06:48.790> from<00:06:49.790> the<00:06:51.490> from

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:52.490 
and that time I'm through from the from

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:54.460 
and that time I'm through from the from
the<00:06:52.580> fourth<00:06:52.850> string<00:06:53.120> sounds<00:06:53.510> best<00:06:53.750> ally<00:06:54.080> you

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:54.470 
the fourth string sounds best ally you

00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:57.909 
the fourth string sounds best ally you
can<00:06:54.710> do<00:06:54.980> it<00:06:55.100> from<00:06:55.190> the<00:06:55.340> fifth<00:06:55.550> string<00:06:56.740> and<00:06:57.740> I

00:06:57.909 --> 00:06:57.919 
can do it from the fifth string and I

00:06:57.919 --> 00:06:59.470 
can do it from the fifth string and I
just<00:06:58.130> strum<00:06:58.310> through<00:06:58.550> those<00:06:58.730> those<00:06:59.270> four

00:06:59.470 --> 00:06:59.480 
just strum through those those four

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:02.210 
strings so there's a few variations for
