00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
split it up into sections because that's

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.200 
split it up into sections because that's
the<00:00:45.870> way<00:00:45.899> did<00:00:46.680> i<00:00:46.739> find<00:00:46.950> it<00:00:47.129> looks<00:00:47.340> most<00:00:47.610> natural

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
the way did i find it looks most natural

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.540 
the way did i find it looks most natural
I<00:00:48.390> take<00:00:48.629> my<00:00:48.870> curling<00:00:49.379> iron<00:00:49.559> and<00:00:49.860> I<00:00:49.980> just<00:00:50.190> wrap

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
I take my curling iron and I just wrap

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.299 
I take my curling iron and I just wrap
it<00:00:50.579> like<00:00:51.110> that<00:00:52.110> and<00:00:52.350> I<00:00:52.500> don't<00:00:52.530> close<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:53.070> clamp

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
it like that and I don't close the clamp

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:54.619 
it like that and I don't close the clamp
because<00:00:53.610> if<00:00:53.699> you<00:00:53.789> close<00:00:54.000> the<00:00:54.180> clamp<00:00:54.420> it

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
because if you close the clamp it

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.600 
because if you close the clamp it
usually<00:00:54.930> gives<00:00:55.020> a<00:00:55.170> clamp<00:00:55.710> on<00:00:55.860> your<00:00:56.309> actual

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
usually gives a clamp on your actual

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.510 
usually gives a clamp on your actual
hair<00:00:56.730> and<00:00:57.180> it's<00:00:57.840> just<00:00:58.109> not<00:00:58.289> very<00:00:58.350> cute<00:00:58.949> so<00:00:59.399> I've

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520
