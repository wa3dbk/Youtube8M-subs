00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.490 

I<00:00:00.120> got<00:00:00.630> up<00:00:00.719> this<00:00:00.810> morning<00:00:00.900> and<00:00:01.170> came<00:00:01.319> outside

00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:01.500 
I got up this morning and came outside

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:03.500 
I got up this morning and came outside
to<00:00:01.709> take<00:00:01.920> her<00:00:02.040> my<00:00:02.159> chickens<00:00:02.550> and<00:00:02.790> it<00:00:03.300> seemed

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:03.510 
to take her my chickens and it seemed

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:04.700 
to take her my chickens and it seemed
like<00:00:03.659> two<00:00:03.810> of<00:00:03.959> them<00:00:04.049> were<00:00:04.140> missing<00:00:04.529> they<00:00:04.650> were

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:04.710 
like two of them were missing they were

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:06.769 
like two of them were missing they were
up<00:00:04.890> in<00:00:05.009> the<00:00:05.130> main<00:00:05.279> coop<00:00:05.520> last<00:00:05.940> night<00:00:06.210> and<00:00:06.690> I

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:06.779 
up in the main coop last night and I

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:08.089 
up in the main coop last night and I
thought<00:00:06.960> where<00:00:07.200> could<00:00:07.560> they<00:00:07.710> have<00:00:07.740> gone<00:00:07.919> so

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
thought where could they have gone so

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:09.860 
thought where could they have gone so
they<00:00:08.160> come<00:00:08.309> out<00:00:08.429> and<00:00:08.700> they<00:00:09.210> are<00:00:09.240> in<00:00:09.570> the<00:00:09.719> garden

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
they come out and they are in the garden

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:11.660 
they come out and they are in the garden
so<00:00:10.530> I<00:00:10.559> thought<00:00:10.800> you<00:00:10.950> know<00:00:10.980> what<00:00:11.219> if<00:00:11.280> this<00:00:11.519> is

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
so I thought you know what if this is

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:12.890 
so I thought you know what if this is
the<00:00:11.759> way<00:00:11.880> it's<00:00:12.000> gonna<00:00:12.090> be<00:00:12.210> and<00:00:12.480> if<00:00:12.570> they<00:00:12.690> want

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
the way it's gonna be and if they want

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.120 
the way it's gonna be and if they want
to<00:00:12.960> be<00:00:13.110> out<00:00:13.139> here<00:00:13.290> I'm<00:00:13.650> just<00:00:13.799> gonna<00:00:13.950> let<00:00:14.070> them

today<00:00:25.800> and<00:00:26.130> let<00:00:26.789> him<00:00:26.910> flirt<00:00:27.090> around<00:00:27.210> while<00:00:27.630> I

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
today and let him flirt around while I

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.500 
today and let him flirt around while I
go<00:00:27.840> to<00:00:27.900> work<00:00:28.019> and<00:00:28.730> I<00:00:29.730> did<00:00:30.060> keep<00:00:30.210> the<00:00:30.359> gate

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
go to work and I did keep the gate

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.120 
go to work and I did keep the gate
closed<00:00:30.840> but<00:00:31.080> this<00:00:31.199> is<00:00:31.320> only<00:00:31.410> a<00:00:31.560> 3-foot<00:00:31.890> fence

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
closed but this is only a 3-foot fence

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.799 
closed but this is only a 3-foot fence
so<00:00:32.340> they<00:00:32.460> can<00:00:32.579> obviously<00:00:32.700> clear<00:00:33.329> this<00:00:33.480> if<00:00:33.690> they

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
so they can obviously clear this if they

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.620 
so they can obviously clear this if they
want<00:00:33.960> to<00:00:34.190> and<00:00:35.190> I'm<00:00:35.309> just<00:00:35.430> going<00:00:35.579> to<00:00:35.760> do

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780
