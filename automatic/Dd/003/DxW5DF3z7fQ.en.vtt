00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:14.510 

so<00:00:13.050> what<00:00:13.200> we<00:00:13.290> got<00:00:13.410> here<00:00:13.440> is<00:00:13.680> the<00:00:13.860> MPC<00:00:14.280> PI

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:14.520 
so what we got here is the MPC PI

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:17.359 
so what we got here is the MPC PI
hardware<00:00:15.240> controller<00:00:15.660> for<00:00:15.900> iPad<00:00:16.290> and<00:00:16.529> the<00:00:16.950> MPC

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
hardware controller for iPad and the MPC

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:18.890 
hardware controller for iPad and the MPC
app<00:00:17.520> that<00:00:17.790> kind<00:00:17.939> of<00:00:17.970> goes<00:00:18.150> with<00:00:18.360> it<00:00:18.630> these<00:00:18.720> are

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
app that kind of goes with it these are

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.960 
app that kind of goes with it these are
you<00:00:19.080> know<00:00:19.250> we<00:00:20.250> have<00:00:20.340> retro<00:00:20.640> names<00:00:20.790> have<00:00:20.910> been

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
you know we have retro names have been

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.640 
you know we have retro names have been
working<00:00:21.270> real<00:00:21.450> closely<00:00:21.750> with<00:00:21.990> a<00:00:22.050> guy<00:00:22.200> to<00:00:22.259> kind

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
working real closely with a guy to kind

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:23.929 
working real closely with a guy to kind
of<00:00:22.710> collaborate<00:00:22.950> on<00:00:23.279> the<00:00:23.400> design<00:00:23.700> of<00:00:23.730> the

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
of collaborate on the design of the

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.210 
of collaborate on the design of the
software<00:00:24.240> and<00:00:24.660> the<00:00:24.750> hardware<00:00:24.890> so<00:00:25.890> this<00:00:26.039> will

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
software and the hardware so this will

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.160 
software and the hardware so this will
control<00:00:26.520> anything<00:00:27.119> that<00:00:27.330> uses<00:00:27.510> more<00:00:27.720> MIDI<00:00:27.960> but

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
control anything that uses more MIDI but

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.380 
control anything that uses more MIDI but
this<00:00:28.529> software<00:00:28.859> is<00:00:29.070> designed<00:00:29.400> to<00:00:29.490> work<00:00:29.640> closer

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
this software is designed to work closer

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:31.820 
this software is designed to work closer
than<00:00:30.689> although<00:00:30.960> all<00:00:31.109> the<00:00:31.230> controls<00:00:31.590> on<00:00:31.740> this

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
than although all the controls on this

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.950 
than although all the controls on this
map<00:00:32.099> directly<00:00:32.669> to<00:00:33.000> the<00:00:33.090> controls<00:00:33.449> on<00:00:33.629> this<00:00:33.780> guy

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
map directly to the controls on this guy

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.700 
map directly to the controls on this guy
so<00:00:34.830> the<00:00:35.280> software<00:00:35.699> itself<00:00:36.059> the<00:00:36.390> MPC<00:00:36.809> app<00:00:36.989> is

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
so the software itself the MPC app is

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.439 
so the software itself the MPC app is
really<00:00:38.160> inspired<00:00:38.580> and<00:00:38.879> trying<00:00:39.090> to<00:00:39.180> attempt<00:00:39.420> to

00:00:39.439 --> 00:00:39.449 
really inspired and trying to attempt to

00:00:39.449 --> 00:00:42.950 
really inspired and trying to attempt to
be<00:00:39.660> an<00:00:39.780> authentically<00:00:40.350> MVC<00:00:41.340> 2000<00:00:42.120> era<00:00:42.300> kind<00:00:42.809> of

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
be an authentically MVC 2000 era kind of

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.709 
be an authentically MVC 2000 era kind of
MPC<00:00:43.559> experience<00:00:44.130> on<00:00:44.340> the<00:00:44.489> iPad<00:00:44.880> be<00:00:45.450> more

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
MPC experience on the iPad be more

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:46.850 
MPC experience on the iPad be more
accessible<00:00:45.989> than<00:00:46.260> ever<00:00:46.440> with<00:00:46.710> the

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
accessible than ever with the

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.770 
accessible than ever with the
touchscreen<00:00:47.120> so<00:00:48.120> you<00:00:48.180> know<00:00:48.300> it's<00:00:48.450> kind<00:00:48.600> of<00:00:48.629> got

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
touchscreen so you know it's kind of got

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.540 
touchscreen so you know it's kind of got
the<00:00:48.899> look<00:00:49.079> of<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.379> ultimate<00:00:49.890> like<00:00:50.129> mm

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:51.550 
the look of the ultimate like mm

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:53.100 
the look of the ultimate like mm
but<00:00:51.970> you<00:00:52.180> know<00:00:52.270> the<00:00:52.420> workflows<00:00:52.780> are<00:00:52.960> a<00:00:52.990> little

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:53.110 
but you know the workflows are a little

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:55.740 
but you know the workflows are a little
bit<00:00:53.320> tweaked<00:00:53.770> so<00:00:54.610> Kelly<00:00:54.970> we<00:00:55.150> got<00:00:55.270> our<00:00:55.360> classic

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:55.750 
bit tweaked so Kelly we got our classic

developing<00:01:24.610> some<00:01:24.759> of<00:01:24.790> this<00:01:24.910> is<00:01:25.030> grayed<00:01:25.240> out

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:25.270 
developing some of this is grayed out

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:26.910 
developing some of this is grayed out
but<00:01:25.630> you<00:01:26.080> know<00:01:26.170> you'll<00:01:26.350> be<00:01:26.380> able<00:01:26.500> to<00:01:26.619> record

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:26.920 
but you know you'll be able to record

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.160 
but you know you'll be able to record
and<00:01:27.190> then<00:01:27.220> erase<00:01:27.550> pads<00:01:28.509> out<00:01:28.720> of<00:01:28.869> your<00:01:28.960> seed

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:29.170 
and then erase pads out of your seed

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:30.690 
and then erase pads out of your seed
plants<00:01:29.500> you'll<00:01:29.649> be<00:01:29.740> able<00:01:29.830> to<00:01:29.950> undo<00:01:30.250> recording

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:30.700

takes<00:01:30.880> all<00:01:31.149> that<00:01:32.050> classic<00:01:32.410> study<00:01:32.970> so<00:01:33.970> the

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
takes all that classic study so the

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.330 
takes all that classic study so the
sequences<00:01:35.259> and<00:01:35.380> whatnot<00:01:35.680> like<00:01:35.890> it's<00:01:36.160> got

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:36.340 
sequences and whatnot like it's got

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:38.790 
sequences and whatnot like it's got
hundreds<00:01:37.119> of<00:01:37.210> which<00:01:38.170> is<00:01:38.290> going<00:01:38.410> to<00:01:38.470> be<00:01:38.590> fell

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:38.800 
hundreds of which is going to be fell

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:40.650 
hundreds of which is going to be fell
upon<00:01:39.070> this<00:01:39.220> thing<00:01:39.430> each<00:01:39.880> one<00:01:40.149> has<00:01:40.360> four

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:40.660 
upon this thing each one has four

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:42.780 
upon this thing each one has four
trumpets<00:01:41.009> simultaneously<00:01:42.009> some<00:01:42.190> more<00:01:42.430> tracks

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:42.790 
trumpets simultaneously some more tracks

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:45.030 
trumpets simultaneously some more tracks
so<00:01:43.360> I<00:01:43.420> can<00:01:43.570> navigate<00:01:43.660> the<00:01:43.990> tracks<00:01:44.259> here<00:01:44.560> you

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:45.040 
so I can navigate the tracks here you

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:46.260 
so I can navigate the tracks here you
know<00:01:45.130> and<00:01:45.340> sort<00:01:45.520> of<00:01:45.610> pull<00:01:45.790> up<00:01:45.880> whatever<00:01:46.149> I

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:46.270 
know and sort of pull up whatever I

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:48.840 
know and sort of pull up whatever I
wanted<00:01:46.600> it's<00:01:47.530> got<00:01:47.680> a<00:01:47.710> four<00:01:47.950> track<00:01:48.190> mixer<00:01:48.610> with

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:48.850 
wanted it's got a four track mixer with

pan and kind of games mute solo and
again<00:01:51.490> like<00:01:51.640> the<00:01:51.820> mute<00:01:52.119> solo<00:01:52.300> over<00:01:52.630> here<00:01:52.869> you

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020 
again like the mute solo over here you

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:54.359 
again like the mute solo over here you
know<00:01:53.110> maps<00:01:53.350> to<00:01:53.530> that<00:01:53.649> directly<00:01:54.100> so<00:01:54.190> I<00:01:54.220> can

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:54.369 
know maps to that directly so I can

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:56.400 
know maps to that directly so I can
navigate<00:01:54.520> my<00:01:54.910> tracks<00:01:55.210> and<00:01:55.420> just<00:01:55.479> beautiful

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:56.410 
navigate my tracks and just beautiful

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:58.109 
navigate my tracks and just beautiful
this<00:01:56.500> you<00:01:57.220> know<00:01:57.310> so<00:01:57.429> you<00:01:57.520> could<00:01:57.610> have<00:01:57.819> once<00:01:58.060> you

this you know so you could have once you

00:01:58.119 --> 00:01:59.669 
this you know so you could have once you
got<00:01:58.240> your<00:01:58.360> iPad<00:01:58.660> in<00:01:58.780> here<00:01:58.810> you<00:01:59.440> have<00:01:59.500> this

got your iPad in here you have this
thing<00:01:59.920> up<00:02:00.069> on<00:02:00.220> the<00:02:00.280> screen<00:02:00.610> while<00:02:00.759> you<00:02:00.850> got

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:00.940 
thing up on the screen while you got

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:02.179 
thing up on the screen while you got
your<00:02:01.060> pads<00:02:01.270> down

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
your pads down

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:03.620 
your pads down
and<00:02:02.429> that's<00:02:02.670> kind<00:02:02.909> of<00:02:02.939> the<00:02:02.999> same<00:02:03.210> way<00:02:03.359> it<00:02:03.479> works

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
and that's kind of the same way it works

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.380 
and that's kind of the same way it works
with<00:02:03.840> the<00:02:03.960> effects<00:02:04.649> bus<00:02:04.999> you've<00:02:05.999> got<00:02:06.119> three

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
with the effects bus you've got three

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.359 
with the effects bus you've got three
effects<00:02:06.689> we<00:02:06.960> got<00:02:07.079> a<00:02:07.109> bit<00:02:07.530> crusher<00:02:07.770> distortion

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
effects we got a bit crusher distortion

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:09.529 
effects we got a bit crusher distortion
that<00:02:08.489> you<00:02:08.550> can<00:02:08.640> just<00:02:08.759> draw<00:02:08.940> on<00:02:09.090> each<00:02:09.209> track

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
that you can just draw on each track

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.589 
that you can just draw on each track
real<00:02:09.780> fast<00:02:10.080> a<00:02:10.739> delay<00:02:11.400> that's<00:02:11.670> tempo<00:02:12.060> syncable

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
real fast a delay that's tempo syncable

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:15.350 
real fast a delay that's tempo syncable
has<00:02:13.500> a<00:02:13.530> filtered<00:02:14.310> amp<00:02:14.549> over<00:02:14.790> time<00:02:15.030> and<00:02:15.269> you<00:02:15.330> can

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
has a filtered amp over time and you can

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:16.970 
has a filtered amp over time and you can
fix<00:02:15.690> your<00:02:16.170> track<00:02:16.410> so<00:02:16.560> it's<00:02:16.650> kind<00:02:16.769> of<00:02:16.830> like<00:02:16.920> a

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
fix your track so it's kind of like a

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.890 
fix your track so it's kind of like a
sand<00:02:17.250> effect<00:02:17.400> and<00:02:18.090> then<00:02:18.209> finally<00:02:18.540> we've<00:02:18.660> got<00:02:18.690> a

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
sand effect and then finally we've got a

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.869 
sand effect and then finally we've got a
master<00:02:19.709> and<00:02:19.890> pressure<00:02:20.129> limiter<00:02:20.640> on<00:02:20.670> the

00:02:20.869 --> 00:02:20.879 
master and pressure limiter on the

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:22.970 
master and pressure limiter on the
master<00:02:21.239> Channel<00:02:21.540> beefed<00:02:22.200> up<00:02:22.349> your<00:02:22.530> sound<00:02:22.739> and

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
master Channel beefed up your sound and

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.910 
master Channel beefed up your sound and
everything<00:02:23.370> so<00:02:24.120> you<00:02:24.840> know<00:02:24.870> the<00:02:25.080> MPC<00:02:25.500> it's<00:02:25.650> at

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
everything so you know the MPC it's at

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.039 
everything so you know the MPC it's at
its<00:02:26.160> Mars<00:02:26.370> is<00:02:26.670> a<00:02:26.700> sampler<00:02:27.450> so<00:02:27.660> we<00:02:27.750> got<00:02:27.870> to<00:02:27.989> have

00:02:28.039 --> 00:02:28.049 
its Mars is a sampler so we got to have

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:30.710 
its Mars is a sampler so we got to have
a<00:02:28.110> real<00:02:28.349> fun<00:02:28.670> sampling<00:02:29.670> workflow<00:02:30.090> so<00:02:30.599> let's

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
a real fun sampling workflow so let's

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.690 
a real fun sampling workflow so let's
say<00:02:30.840> I<00:02:30.900> want<00:02:31.110> to<00:02:31.140> edit<00:02:31.319> my<00:02:31.650> conga<00:02:32.160> kit<00:02:32.370> here<00:02:32.549> so

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
I can shortcut right in and I'm editing

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.530 
I can shortcut right in and I'm editing
my<00:02:34.349> kid<00:02:34.680> I<00:02:34.920> can<00:02:35.340> track<00:02:35.579> the<00:02:35.760> samples<00:02:36.180> from<00:02:36.329> pad

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
my kid I can track the samples from pad

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.509 
my kid I can track the samples from pad
and<00:02:36.750> pad<00:02:36.900> duplicate<00:02:37.470> them<00:02:37.620> I<00:02:37.829> can<00:02:38.190> jump<00:02:38.400> right

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:38.519 
and pad duplicate them I can jump right

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:40.699 
and pad duplicate them I can jump right
into<00:02:38.700> my<00:02:38.849> Akai<00:02:39.180> you<00:02:39.480> know<00:02:39.569> like<00:02:39.870> factory<00:02:40.410> sound

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
it's faster than ever to just play out a

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.589 
it's faster than ever to just play out a
drum<00:02:46.950> kit<00:02:47.099> with<00:02:47.280> this<00:02:47.400> thing<00:02:47.610> you<00:02:47.730> know<00:02:47.849> and<00:02:48.360> so

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
like I can also drop on my own samples

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:52.729 
like I can also drop on my own samples
and<00:02:51.239> whatever<00:02:51.690> waves<00:02:52.019> I've<00:02:52.230> got<00:02:52.379> sit<00:02:52.560> around

thing you have access to them the fun
part<00:02:56.849> is<00:02:56.940> like<00:02:57.060> I<00:02:57.180> can<00:02:57.359> select<00:02:57.540> a<00:02:57.690> pad<00:02:57.870> here

00:02:58.369 --> 00:02:58.379 
part is like I can select a pad here

00:02:58.379 --> 00:02:59.839 
part is like I can select a pad here
I<00:02:58.410> just<00:02:58.709> shortcut<00:02:59.069> right<00:02:59.190> to<00:02:59.340> the<00:02:59.430> sampler

00:02:59.839 --> 00:02:59.849 
I just shortcut right to the sampler

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:02.010 
I just shortcut right to the sampler
looks<00:03:00.480> like<00:03:00.690> that<00:03:00.900> you<00:03:00.930> know<00:03:01.109> normal

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:02.020 
looks like that you know normal

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:04.230 
looks like that you know normal
FBC<00:03:02.500> sampler<00:03:03.100> we're<00:03:03.310> close<00:03:03.550> I<00:03:03.880> can<00:03:04.030> sample

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:04.240 
FBC sampler we're close I can sample

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:06.840 
FBC sampler we're close I can sample
from<00:03:04.480> the<00:03:04.600> built-in<00:03:04.840> mic<00:03:05.230> the<00:03:05.830> line<00:03:06.040> input<00:03:06.310> for

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:06.850 
from the built-in mic the line input for

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:08.430 
from the built-in mic the line input for
the<00:03:06.970> dock<00:03:07.180> connector<00:03:07.690> you<00:03:08.020> know<00:03:08.110> if<00:03:08.170> I've<00:03:08.290> got

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:08.440 
the dock connector you know if I've got

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:09.810 
the dock connector you know if I've got
some<00:03:08.650> kind<00:03:08.860> of<00:03:08.890> pro<00:03:09.100> mic<00:03:09.340> or<00:03:09.490> something<00:03:09.730> like

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:09.820 
some kind of pro mic or something like

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:11.670 
some kind of pro mic or something like
that<00:03:09.970> that<00:03:10.120> uses<00:03:10.390> that<00:03:10.540> so<00:03:11.170> I<00:03:11.200> can<00:03:11.380> just<00:03:11.410> sample

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
that that uses that so I can just sample

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:12.990 
that that uses that so I can just sample
right<00:03:11.980> on<00:03:12.130> here<00:03:12.400> and<00:03:12.520> they'll<00:03:12.670> drop<00:03:12.820> it<00:03:12.970> right

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
right on here and they'll drop it right

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000 
right on here and they'll drop it right
on<00:03:13.240> the<00:03:13.330> pad<00:03:13.510> and<00:03:14.110> finally<00:03:14.470> I<00:03:14.500> can<00:03:14.740> pull<00:03:14.890> up<00:03:14.980> my

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.010 
on the pad and finally I can pull up my

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:48.720 
sure it sounds right tag it save it now
try<00:03:46.840> it<00:03:46.900> on<00:03:46.990> that<00:03:47.140> pad<00:03:47.350> so<00:03:48.100> I<00:03:48.130> can<00:03:48.370> just<00:03:48.580> like

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:48.730 
try it on that pad so I can just like

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:51.150 
try it on that pad so I can just like
sample<00:03:49.330> across<00:03:49.630> these<00:03:49.840> pads<00:03:50.110> real<00:03:50.500> easily<00:03:50.740> and
