00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:19.680

 that I have enough time that I do not 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.980
 videos a month or two months but I do not know 

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:33.900
 but I'm back do not worry and 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.330
 at the end I'm around in some things 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:39.360
 they left me they do not let me rather do 

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:40.860
 videos but already those things back and better 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.040
 I dedicate this to fuck your mother to 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:47.910
 good egg let's download the file 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:51.150
 I'll leave you here in the description 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:54.330
 call in create 1.7 I missed the point 2 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:56.280
 so there's no problem then we're going to 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:01:00.020
 unzip already know right click 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.910
 minecraft 1.7 extract 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:04.190
 to unzip a folder that is 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:06.970
 mecca 1.7 we open it we open it fortuneteller 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:10.110
 that exists here is fine x state 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:13.180
 and we also open the folder and we give it 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:16.840
 we started the minecraft launcher very well 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:19.800
 since we open the same crafter we're going to 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:22.680
 make a new profile 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:24.000
 I do not know how about this outbreak because I had 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.210
 created not if I'm going to do it 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.870
 new profile and here the name number 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:33.980
 of the profile rather we are going to put 1 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:35.570
 point 7.2 your name that you want 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:37.510
 here are several options either the 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:39.410
 location where do you want it to be 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:40.940
 enable test versions of 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:43.420
 snapshots as you can see here there is a 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:43.420
 snapshot 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:50.020
 Here he asks us which version we want 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:52.930
 here there are several versions whether it 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:54.250
 can put the 1.7 points 2 or the 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:56.110
 latest version available so if 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:57.430
 there is a single version is updated is 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.710
 updatable this is so it does not 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:01.690
 worry about that the relationship I 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:04.060
 I recommend that you do not hit anything there I do not know 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:06.980
 what could be obvious that is the solution 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:09.650
 but I have not experienced 

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:11.950
 java configuration this here in 

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:14.500
 executable or is it 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:17.140
 how to tell them the program so that 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.519
 boot grip so to speak that 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.940
 is what we get that the minecraft 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:23.349
 the desk something like that not all and 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:26.140
 like this one and how is it here 

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:28.440
 how much roll to study and save 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.440
 profile 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:35.620
 and here we are going to give you a premium account 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:35.620
 should show users well 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:47.570
 we are going to give in playing and it will be 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:50.140
 running on this one and there it is today going to 

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:53.370
 take longer I already had it 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:56.709
 as you can see all normal singleplayer 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:59.010
 I have nothing because I deleted it and the 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:59.010
 fucking 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:03.770
 and every time we want to see we have to 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:07.090
 open the launcher 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:07.090
 so that they see access to a demonstration 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:13.580
 launcher is not the executable of 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:17.380
 minecraft chingue your mother takes a little 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:20.440
 take a little time and that's it 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:24.030
 and we can play him off-line by loading 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:24.030
 loading loading 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:29.420
 and there it is open see no problem 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:31.120

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:34.819
