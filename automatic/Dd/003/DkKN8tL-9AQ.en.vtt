00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:05.970
 we are now recording 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.530
 which was carried out on 20 June 2009 at the railway station of 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:11.569
 Araraquara 

00:00:11.569 --> 00:00:14.789
 interior of são paulo 

00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:16.560
 we see that 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.590
 the train station thank god was not abandoned did not turn one as 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:23.009
 they did not see a bit of bad guys 

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:29.109
 in it was not overthrown as many inner São Paulo stations were so 

00:00:29.979 --> 00:00:32.870
 the araraquara railway station 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:36.110
 today it is the railway museum where the staff also 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.830
 these models and would do the modeling found 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:42.800
 a little thing shortening people 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.050
 since the station and to be abandoned in the then nothing more 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.610
 nothing more just 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:51.850
 than doing it with what it turns out to be that she did 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:54.670
 from the acquis 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:57.990
 of the museum telling the history of the railroad in the city 

00:00:57.990 --> 00:00:59.910
 in the region 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.789
 logically we only have freight trains 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.210
 passing 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:07.100
 we still have the rail yard 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.440
 which was recently renovated 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:13.880
 although they still talk so much about the withdrawal of the rails from the city center 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:14.830
 While 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:16.830
 the uname rome 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.760
 a move 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:23.590
 there is no way to remove these rails in the center of the 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:24.420
 City 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.430
 ah he is he latin america logistics 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:30.600
 it is forming part while it is logically using 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.290
 and so she goes by with her trains 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.820
 here was qualified or centered in the old center at the railway station 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:45.810
 being that 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.619
 if it were green line for which there would be no railway station 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.370
 because it was the railroad makes a specific hard 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:54.840
 make a goal 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.450
 the railroad arrive in the city or the train was going to enter by the village sílvia 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.300
 come to the city center 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:04.380
 and goes out through surveillance via 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.260
 it's a somewhat geography 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:10.260
 how strange but unfortunately we also have to lament here 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:13.709
 we do not have passenger trains anymore 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:16.519
 here they pass by our city 

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:19.519
 This is regrettable because all elections heard promises 

00:02:21.009 --> 00:02:24.189
 I'm very big here today, I just wish 

00:02:24.189 --> 00:02:27.189
 ps the candidate here suddenly 

00:02:27.999 --> 00:02:29.509
 asked me to vote 

00:02:29.509 --> 00:02:32.599

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:34.079

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:35.419
