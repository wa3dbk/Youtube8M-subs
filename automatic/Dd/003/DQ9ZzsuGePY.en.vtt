got some serial numbers on the back but

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.000 
got some serial numbers on the back but
nothing<00:00:35.399> too<00:00:35.750> two<00:00:36.750> major<00:00:36.960> so<00:00:37.620> let's<00:00:37.829> get<00:00:37.950> into

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
nothing too two major so let's get into

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.650 
nothing too two major so let's get into
the<00:00:38.190> box<00:00:38.399> and<00:00:38.670> see<00:00:38.730> if<00:00:39.210> there's<00:00:39.390> anything

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
the box and see if there's anything

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.600 
the box and see if there's anything
different<00:00:39.950> most<00:00:40.950> likely<00:00:41.190> it's<00:00:41.340> going<00:00:41.460> to<00:00:41.550> be

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
different most likely it's going to be

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.060 
different most likely it's going to be
the<00:00:41.670> same<00:00:41.790> as<00:00:41.969> every<00:00:42.270> other<00:00:42.300> iphone<00:00:42.809> but<00:00:43.770> what

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
the same as every other iphone but what

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.970 
the same as every other iphone but what
I<00:00:44.100> would<00:00:44.190> look<00:00:44.309> inside<00:00:44.610> there<00:00:44.789> anyway<00:00:48.920> okay<00:00:49.920> so

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
I would look inside there anyway okay so

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.470 
I would look inside there anyway okay so
I<00:00:50.219> just<00:00:50.430> peeled<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:50.969> bottom<00:00:51.210> it<00:00:51.329> at<00:00:51.420> the

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
I just peeled the bottom it at the

00:00:51.480 --> 00:01:01.849 
I just peeled the bottom it at the
plastic<00:00:51.690> off<00:00:53.090> and<00:00:54.090> there<00:00:54.660> it<00:00:54.809> is<00:01:00.050> so<00:01:01.050> as<00:01:01.590> you

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
plastic off and there it is so as you

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:07.969 
plastic off and there it is so as you
can<00:01:01.949> see<00:01:02.190> is<00:01:02.750> identical<00:01:03.750> to<00:01:05.420> the<00:01:06.420> for<00:01:06.979> nothing

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
can see is identical to the for nothing

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.320 
can see is identical to the for nothing
differ<00:01:08.220> at<00:01:08.430> all<00:01:08.640> not<00:01:08.820> even<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:09.150> back<00:01:09.299> I

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
differ at all not even the back I

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:10.399 
differ at all not even the back I
thought<00:01:09.540> maybe<00:01:09.750> there'll<00:01:10.110> be<00:01:10.140> something

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
thought maybe there'll be something

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:11.630 
thought maybe there'll be something
slightly<00:01:10.680> different<00:01:10.830> on<00:01:11.100> the<00:01:11.189> bottom<00:01:11.430> there

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
slightly different on the bottom there

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.859 
slightly different on the bottom there
but<00:01:12.270> it's<00:01:12.420> completely<00:01:12.630> identical<00:01:14.659> so<00:01:15.659> as<00:01:15.840> you

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
but it's completely identical so as you

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.480 
but it's completely identical so as you
can<00:01:16.020> see<00:01:16.259> if<00:01:16.619> you<00:01:16.830> want<00:01:17.040> to<00:01:17.100> see<00:01:17.189> what<00:01:17.340> one<00:01:17.460> of

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
can see if you want to see what one of

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.940 
can see if you want to see what one of
these<00:01:17.640> look<00:01:17.850> like<00:01:17.880> just<00:01:18.479> look<00:01:18.600> at<00:01:18.750> your<00:01:18.950> iphone

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
these look like just look at your iphone

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.149 
these look like just look at your iphone
4<00:01:20.640> because<00:01:21.509> it's<00:01:21.630> identical<00:01:22.110> now<00:01:22.680> in<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:22.920> Box

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
4 because it's identical now in the Box

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:24.410 
4 because it's identical now in the Box
automation<00:01:23.640> will<00:01:23.759> be<00:01:23.820> the<00:01:23.939> same<00:01:24.119> sort<00:01:24.390> of

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
automation will be the same sort of

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.300 
automation will be the same sort of
things<00:01:24.659> and<00:01:25.110> it<00:01:25.770> is<00:01:25.920> exactly<00:01:26.369> the<00:01:26.610> same<00:01:26.700> as<00:01:28.310> the

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
things and it is exactly the same as the

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.179
