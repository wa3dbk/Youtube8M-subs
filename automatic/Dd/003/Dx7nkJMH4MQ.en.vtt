righty nothing about a centimeter each
I'll<00:00:45.490> be<00:00:45.820> drying<00:00:46.120> them<00:00:46.330> a<00:00:46.420> little<00:00:46.690> bit<00:00:46.810> first

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:47.110 
I'll be drying them a little bit first

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:52.440 
I'll be drying them a little bit first
and<00:00:47.410> then<00:00:47.620> smoking<00:00:48.160> them<00:00:51.060> there<00:00:52.060> you<00:00:52.150> going

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:52.450 
and then smoking them there you going

and then smoking them there you going
this<00:00:52.690> is<00:00:52.960> why<00:00:53.170> I<00:00:53.200> want<00:00:53.530> you<00:00:53.710> to<00:00:53.740> be<00:00:53.980> a<00:00:54.400> sharp

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:54.670 
this is why I want you to be a sharp

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:57.270 
this is why I want you to be a sharp

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:57.280 
knife because you don't want to have

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.850 
knife because you don't want to have
that<00:00:57.460> knife<00:00:57.640> bouncing<00:00:58.450> all<00:00:58.600> over<00:00:58.630> the<00:00:58.960> skin<00:00:59.710> of

00:00:59.850 --> 00:00:59.860 
that knife bouncing all over the skin of

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:02.490 
that knife bouncing all over the skin of
the<00:01:00.010> chili<00:01:00.280> because<00:01:00.730> it's<00:01:01.000> it's<00:01:01.690> like<00:01:01.900> kind<00:01:02.410> of

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:02.500 
the chili because it's it's like kind of

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.590 
the chili because it's it's like kind of
tough<00:01:02.710> to<00:01:02.740> get<00:01:03.010> through<00:01:03.239> you<00:01:04.239> don't<00:01:04.420> have<00:01:04.570> a

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:04.600 
tough to get through you don't have a

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.420 
tough to get through you don't have a
decent<00:01:04.809> bike

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:07.430 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:10.680 

just<00:01:08.060> chop<00:01:08.270> it<00:01:08.300> up<00:01:08.480> really<00:01:08.950> roughly<00:01:09.950> and<00:01:10.370> then

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:10.690 
just chop it up really roughly and then

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:16.120 
just chop it up really roughly and then
we'll<00:01:11.690> grind<00:01:11.990> it<00:01:12.200> later<00:01:12.410> on<00:01:13.450> look<00:01:14.450> at<00:01:14.570> it<00:01:15.130> you

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.130 
we'll grind it later on look at it you

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:17.860 
we'll grind it later on look at it you
might<00:01:16.400> be<00:01:16.430> able<00:01:16.700> to<00:01:17.180> see<00:01:17.360> that

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:17.870 
might be able to see that

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:24.030 
might be able to see that
capsaicin<00:01:18.590> oil<00:01:19.280> kind<00:01:20.000> of<00:01:20.090> shining<00:01:20.450> inside<00:01:20.810> so

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:24.040 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:27.040 

I'm<00:01:25.040> putting<00:01:25.460> it<00:01:25.610> in<00:01:25.760> to<00:01:25.970> dehydrate<00:01:26.690> of<00:01:26.840> these

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:27.050 
I'm putting it in to dehydrate of these

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:32.080 
I'm putting it in to dehydrate of these
chilies<00:01:27.560> I<00:01:28.540> have<00:01:29.540> the<00:01:29.750> theory<00:01:30.170> that<00:01:30.200> I<00:01:30.700> kind<00:01:31.700> of

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.090 
chilies I have the theory that I kind of

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:36.820 
chilies I have the theory that I kind of
dried<00:01:32.750> like<00:01:33.260> 80%<00:01:33.800> dry<00:01:34.550> first<00:01:35.500> so<00:01:36.500> that<00:01:36.710> the

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:36.830 
dried like 80% dry first so that the

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:38.980 
dried like 80% dry first so that the
smoke<00:01:37.130> permeates<00:01:37.850> the<00:01:38.090> chili<00:01:38.450> a<00:01:38.479> little<00:01:38.869> bit

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 
smoke permeates the chili a little bit

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:43.990 
smoke permeates the chili a little bit
better<00:01:39.340> kind<00:01:40.340> of<00:01:40.399> a<00:01:40.520> theory<00:01:40.880> on<00:01:43.000> the

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.000 
better kind of a theory on the

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:53.520 
better kind of a theory on the
dehydrator<00:01:49.210> depending<00:01:50.210> on<00:01:50.330> how<00:01:50.479> much<00:01:52.509> it's

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.530 
dehydrator depending on how much it's

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.040 
dehydrator depending on how much it's
humid<00:01:54.530> outside<00:01:54.710> where<00:01:55.490> my<00:01:55.670> smoker<00:01:55.970> is<00:01:56.360> it's

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:57.050 
humid outside where my smoker is it's

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:02.430 
humid outside where my smoker is it's
snowing<00:01:57.590> on<00:01:57.710> nothing

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:02.440 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:05.200 

there's<00:02:03.440> my<00:02:03.649> cherry<00:02:03.950> wood<00:02:04.220> I<00:02:04.490> like<00:02:04.970> cherry

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.210 
there's my cherry wood I like cherry

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:08.949 
there's my cherry wood I like cherry
wood<00:02:05.570> it's<00:02:05.810> kind<00:02:06.289> of<00:02:06.410> a<00:02:06.440> mild<00:02:07.660> wood<00:02:08.660> smoke

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:08.959 
wood it's kind of a mild wood smoke

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:14.320 
wood it's kind of a mild wood smoke
thing<00:02:10.060> I'm<00:02:11.060> using<00:02:11.360> my<00:02:11.840> smoke<00:02:12.709> daddy<00:02:13.330> the

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
thing I'm using my smoke daddy the

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.420 
thing I'm using my smoke daddy the
smoker<00:02:14.630> I'll<00:02:15.290> put<00:02:15.680> a<00:02:15.709> link<00:02:15.950> in<00:02:16.400> the

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
smoker I'll put a link in the

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.640 
smoker I'll put a link in the
description<00:02:16.970> below<00:02:17.690> so<00:02:18.080> you<00:02:18.200> can<00:02:18.230> see<00:02:18.410> a

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
description below so you can see a

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:20.780 
description below so you can see a
little<00:02:18.920> bit<00:02:19.100> about<00:02:19.160> that

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
little bit about that

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:25.130 
little bit about that
I<00:02:20.819> kind<00:02:21.420> of<00:02:21.480> like<00:02:21.689> it<00:02:23.030> it's<00:02:24.030> a<00:02:24.120> special<00:02:24.629> system

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
I kind of like it it's a special system

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.699 
I kind of like it it's a special system
with<00:02:25.349> the<00:02:25.470> air<00:02:25.709> pump<00:02:26.010> and<00:02:27.049> that<00:02:28.049> feeds<00:02:28.379> it

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
with the air pump and that feeds it

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:30.140 
with the air pump and that feeds it
smoke<00:02:28.980> into<00:02:29.370> the<00:02:29.400> chamber

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
smoke into the chamber

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.470 
smoke into the chamber
here<00:02:30.659> we<00:02:30.750> have<00:02:30.930> it<00:02:31.079> we<00:02:31.530> have<00:02:31.709> smoke<00:02:32.480> I'm

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
here we have it we have smoke I'm

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.449 
here we have it we have smoke I'm
smoking<00:02:33.540> for<00:02:34.230> about<00:02:34.319> two<00:02:34.650> hours<00:02:34.680> with<00:02:35.310> the

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 
smoking for about two hours with the

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.990 

I'm<00:03:06.230> using<00:03:06.470> the<00:03:06.710> pestle<00:03:07.100> and<00:03:07.160> mortar<00:03:07.280> instead

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
I'm using the pestle and mortar instead

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:18.660 
I'm using the pestle and mortar instead
of<00:03:08.120> fighting<00:03:09.020> with<00:03:09.650> it<00:03:10.250> rises<00:03:12.550> to<00:03:13.550> the<00:03:13.580> plate
