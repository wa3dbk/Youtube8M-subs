00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
do check your countries pricing and

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:59.209 
do check your countries pricing and
maybe<00:01:56.640> slightly<00:01:57.060> different<00:01:57.649> you<00:01:58.649> do<00:01:58.829> only<00:01:59.040> get

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
maybe slightly different you do only get

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:00.649 
maybe slightly different you do only get
eight<00:01:59.399> gigabytes<00:01:59.820> of<00:01:59.909> memory<00:01:59.969> with<00:02:00.270> this<00:02:00.450> one

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
eight gigabytes of memory with this one

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.450 
eight gigabytes of memory with this one
although<00:02:00.899> you<00:02:01.020> can<00:02:01.200> tweak<00:02:01.439> it<00:02:01.590> compared<00:02:01.950> to<00:02:02.070> 16

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
although you can tweak it compared to 16

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.450 
although you can tweak it compared to 16
gigabytes<00:02:02.939> with<00:02:03.119> anywhere<00:02:03.420> 14<00:02:03.810> top-spec<00:02:04.649> but

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
gigabytes with anywhere 14 top-spec but

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.940 
gigabytes with anywhere 14 top-spec but
I<00:02:05.640> think<00:02:05.939> 16<00:02:06.509> gigabytes<00:02:06.899> is<00:02:07.079> a<00:02:07.110> bit<00:02:07.350> overkill<00:02:07.740> a

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
I think 16 gigabytes is a bit overkill a

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.750 
I think 16 gigabytes is a bit overkill a
gigabytes<00:02:08.550> is<00:02:08.849> more<00:02:09.270> than<00:02:09.390> enough<00:02:10.220> now<00:02:11.220> I've

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
gigabytes is more than enough now I've

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.790 
gigabytes is more than enough now I've
gone<00:02:12.209> about<00:02:12.480> how<00:02:12.660> great<00:02:12.989> the<00:02:13.140> anywhere<00:02:13.379> 70

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
gone about how great the anywhere 70

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.310 
gone about how great the anywhere 70
in<00:02:14.220> regards<00:02:14.550> to<00:02:14.580> power<00:02:14.820> over<00:02:15.210> the<00:02:15.300> 14<00:02:15.660> but<00:02:16.230> of

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
in regards to power over the 14 but of

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.560 
in regards to power over the 14 but of
course<00:02:16.740> the<00:02:16.950> 14<00:02:17.340> could<00:02:17.700> upgrade<00:02:17.820> the<00:02:18.000> GPU<00:02:18.480> in

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:18.570 
course the 14 could upgrade the GPU in

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:20.870 
course the 14 could upgrade the GPU in
the<00:02:18.660> near<00:02:18.840> future<00:02:19.050> but<00:02:20.010> I<00:02:20.040> still<00:02:20.340> think<00:02:20.700> the

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
the near future but I still think the

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.550 
the near future but I still think the
main<00:02:21.150> thing<00:02:21.600> to<00:02:21.810> consider<00:02:21.960> when<00:02:22.350> deciding

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
main thing to consider when deciding

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.900 
main thing to consider when deciding
between<00:02:22.920> the<00:02:23.160> 14<00:02:23.640> or<00:02:23.850> the<00:02:24.450> 17<00:02:25.020> is<00:02:25.910> the

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
between the 14 or the 17 is the

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.810 
between the 14 or the 17 is the
portability<00:02:27.690> or<00:02:28.140> what<00:02:28.410> how<00:02:29.130> portable<00:02:29.490> you

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
portability or what how portable you

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:33.500 
portability or what how portable you
want<00:02:30.800> your<00:02:31.800> laptop<00:02:32.130> to<00:02:32.220> be<00:02:32.370> now<00:02:33.180> the<00:02:33.240> only
