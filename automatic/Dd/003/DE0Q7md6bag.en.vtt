00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:23.720 
difference this is an Eton airport

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:25.840 
difference this is an Eton airport
important<00:01:24.289> I<00:01:24.320> believe<00:01:24.350> it's<00:01:24.619> called<00:01:24.680> and<00:01:25.100> it's

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:25.850 
important I believe it's called and it's

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:29.440 
important I believe it's called and it's
already<00:01:26.210> blooming<00:01:27.520> problem<00:01:28.520> with<00:01:28.670> this<00:01:28.940> is<00:01:29.270> if

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:29.450 
already blooming problem with this is if

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.859 
already blooming problem with this is if
we<00:01:29.630> have<00:01:29.810> a<00:01:29.840> late<00:01:30.110> frost<00:01:30.410> and<00:01:31.420> we<00:01:32.420> do<00:01:32.570> a<00:01:32.600> lot<00:01:32.810> of

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:32.869 
we have a late frost and we do a lot of

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:35.850 
we have a late frost and we do a lot of
times<00:01:33.170> and<00:01:33.470> Louisiana<00:01:33.890> have<00:01:34.130> a<00:01:34.910> nice<00:01:35.360> to<00:01:35.539> frost

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:35.860 
times and Louisiana have a nice to frost

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:39.969 
times and Louisiana have a nice to frost
so<00:01:36.860> when<00:01:37.520> these<00:01:37.789> early<00:01:38.300> blooming<00:01:38.979> trees

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:39.979 
so when these early blooming trees

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:42.130 
so when these early blooming trees
you're<00:01:40.190> going<00:01:40.340> to<00:01:40.399> lose<00:01:40.550> your<00:01:40.610> crop<00:01:41.060> and<00:01:41.140> I'll

00:01:45.279 --> 00:01:45.289 
show you a pear tree that pairs later

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:48.850 
show you a pear tree that pairs later
I'm<00:01:45.590> that<00:01:46.039> blooms<00:01:46.490> later<00:01:46.849> and<00:01:47.560> usually<00:01:48.560> you

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:01.200 
for all state now but if you notice
these<00:01:59.470> paper<00:01:59.860> just<00:02:00.130> pear<00:02:00.370> tree<00:02:00.700> is<00:02:00.850> just

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:01.210 
these paper just pear tree is just

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:03.990 
these paper just pear tree is just
starting<00:02:01.690> to<00:02:01.720> bloom<00:02:02.340> so<00:02:03.340> if<00:02:03.490> we<00:02:03.550> would<00:02:03.850> have

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:04.000 
starting to bloom so if we would have

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.080 
starting to bloom so if we would have
got<00:02:04.150> an<00:02:04.300> early<00:02:04.600> frost<00:02:05.070> the<00:02:06.070> all<00:02:06.580> the<00:02:06.880> pear

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.090 
got an early frost the all the pear

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:09.810 
got an early frost the all the pear
trees<00:02:07.480> and<00:02:07.720> pick<00:02:08.410> the<00:02:08.649> peach<00:02:09.310> trees<00:02:09.640> and

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:09.820 
trees and pick the peach trees and

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:10.980 
trees and pick the peach trees and
everything<00:02:09.970> that<00:02:10.210> you<00:02:10.330> see<00:02:10.510> that's<00:02:10.690> fully

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:10.990 
everything that you see that's fully

everything that you see that's fully
bloom<00:02:11.320> down<00:02:11.560> flowered<00:02:12.130> we<00:02:12.790> lost<00:02:13.120> all<00:02:13.360> their

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
bloom down flowered we lost all their

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.720 
bloom down flowered we lost all their
crops<00:02:13.890> so<00:02:14.890> that's<00:02:15.070> why<00:02:15.280> I<00:02:15.310> like<00:02:15.370> to<00:02:15.580> do<00:02:15.700> a

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
crops so that's why I like to do a

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.620 
crops so that's why I like to do a
mixture<00:02:16.240> of<00:02:16.540> an<00:02:17.320> early<00:02:17.650> flowering<00:02:18.280> and<00:02:19.210> elite

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630 
mixture of an early flowering and elite

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:21.190 
mixture of an early flowering and elite
flower

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
flower

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.410

the cannery and to preserve this is

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:35.830 
the cannery and to preserve this is
another<00:02:34.670> tree<00:02:34.940> that's<00:02:35.060> a<00:02:35.209> late<00:02:35.360> bloomer<00:02:35.540> if

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
another tree that's a late bloomer if

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.650 
another tree that's a late bloomer if
you<00:02:35.959> look<00:02:36.550> the<00:02:37.550> blooms<00:02:37.849> are<00:02:38.030> just<00:02:38.330> now

you got to do is you got to take the

you got to do is you got to take the

I've<00:03:55.459> never<00:03:55.699> done<00:03:55.969> it<00:03:56.180> but<00:03:56.299> we're<00:03:56.480> going<00:03:56.599> to
