00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.291
 I'm sorry baby 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.631
 It must be obvious to others. 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.081
 I should have left the track. 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.971
 The first time I saw... your expression. 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:33.901
 I plead guilty for not being able to speak out. 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:37.341
 You are always frustrated and ending with a quarrel 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.011
 ...to the end of the self-esteem 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.581
 I wanna see you and love you again 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:47.411
 ...but it’s too late 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.701
 I found out that I'm just a really fool 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:55.191
 "Reminiscence" can't be divided... I am confused about now 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:57.911
 I can't get back that time 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.431
 (can't go back) 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.251
 (past...absolute) 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:04.981
 When you were surely mine 

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:08.241
 (can't fall in love with anyone) 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.881
 (must, except you) 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:11.901
 I can't get back that time 

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:15.181
 (I want to try to move forward) 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:16.281
 (only looking at the future) 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.741
 When you were surely mine 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.061
 (Can not forget you) 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:24.711
 (but can't think of you) 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:28.841
 "It shouldn't be like this" 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:31.671
 Used very often this time 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.891
 But there is a dream that cannot be abandoned. 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.731
 Gradual expansion gap 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.671
 ...continuously looking for errors 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:48.961
 However, the ideal is different from the responsibility of reality, asking it, passing it on 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:50.071
 lost you 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.101
 I shouldn't be the man that I am 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:55.851
 Said "forever" 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.411
 An excuse to maintain the exact moment (Excuse) 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:04.081
 "In any case, time will only pass away"... You said so right? 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:06.621
 I can't get back that time 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.961
 (can't go back) 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:11.291
 (past...absolute) 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.611
 When you were surely mine 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.801
 (can't fall in love with anyone) 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:18.031
 (must, except you) 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.451
 I can't get back that time (Move forward...) 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:23.771
 (I want to try to move forward) 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:24.991
 (only looking at the future) 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.241
 When you were surely mine 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:30.631
 (Can not forget you) 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.451
 (but can't think of you) 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:40.811
 Today, this day soon became yesterday. 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:46.711
 The same is spent...the dream is also, the sigh is also 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:53.661
 You see, today’s sunset is falling. 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.741
 Tears stained cheeks 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.221
 …miss you 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:15.281
 I can't get back that time 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:18.631
 (can't go back) 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:19.951
 (past...absolute) 

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:22.061
 When you were surely mine 

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:25.441
 (can't fall in love with anyone anymore) 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:26.961
 (must, except you) 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.001
 (can't get back that time 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:32.321
 (I want to try to move forward) 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:33.541
 (only looking at the future) 

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:35.801
 When you were surely mine 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:39.191
 (Can not forget you) 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.701
 (but can't think of you) 

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:47.991
 Once you were mine, baby
