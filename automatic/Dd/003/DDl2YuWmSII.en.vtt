 another name he had in mind that commanded the continuity of our listener 

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:09.969
 after all the union budget project 

00:00:09.969 --> 00:00:11.959

 We are going to start our project. 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.039
 so far it's assumed 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:20.179
 resize 

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:23.820
 how come i'm iran said pilot used no tool part knows 

00:00:23.819 --> 00:00:25.210
 is injured there 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:29.079
 She let him come personal to the ball from the middle of the routine 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:34.760
 who you if you can approach the tanks and guns that this is 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:35.970
 a form of June 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:40.010
 but when you leave it pressed in the middle you can make a turn 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.760
 promised 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.660
 made the block objects 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.280
 sector 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.800
 the likud iranduba 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.490
 have been object he is not object 

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:54.490
 three-dimensional state only as a point 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.730
 for you know right? 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:00.730
 the starting point 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.410
 we have 

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:10.150
 if I do not want to know how to take the show or select and from here I'm going to give a dance 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:11.170
 act 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:13.110
 he leaves here 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.140
 Okay, let's see here ok 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.880
 after the basic principles of the basic 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:21.610
 the celebration 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:24.610
 first we have here the tool repeat 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:28.290
 you will start 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:29.360
 working 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.600
 ever 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.600
 Since I figured we have here 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.490
 here we had then our own shaken and 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:39.800
 and here it would go 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:40.939
 the relative girl 

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:44.000
 so why are you going to start working? 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.470
 if I have passed here I can not stand it 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:50.470
 Of course we have the 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:53.900
 the air judge 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:57.650
 so any of these points here you can start directly on the line 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:00.650
 basis or internally explains 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:06.250
 look only down here in the right corner here 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:08.849
 already in the lower right corner 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:11.379
 measures are already appearing 

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:13.309
 with this idea 

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:16.590
 how do you choose the unit measures by centimeter 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.179
 So we're feeling 

00:02:19.179 --> 00:02:23.589
 if you know them Methodist benett if you could mini-track food 

00:02:24.119 --> 00:02:27.119
 and so with a colleague 2 

00:02:28.439 --> 00:02:29.899
 me or here 

00:02:29.899 --> 00:02:32.079
 suit 

00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:33.140
 I'll create here 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:35.059
 The next I can delete this here. 

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:38.479
 without releasing a mouse 

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:39.500
 I'll put it here 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:40.849
 200 

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:43.849
 semicolon 

00:02:45.139 --> 00:02:47.449
 wanted them to automatically create it 

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:51.249
 an image of 200 centimeters per 200 

00:02:55.039 --> 00:02:57.429
 thomati path 

00:02:57.429 --> 00:02:59.899
 I made a comeback and now I can do 

00:02:59.899 --> 00:03:01.629
 the next day 

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:03.119
 by mark zuckerberg 

00:03:03.119 --> 00:03:05.849
 you can have an Achilles name 

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:09.749
 making 

00:03:09.749 --> 00:03:11.389
 the face for example 

00:03:11.389 --> 00:03:14.399
 I want to lose the game right now. 

00:03:14.399 --> 00:03:16.739
 semicolon 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:17.780
 who sees 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:21.269
 lisboa 8 

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:22.680
 I'm imagining myself 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.049
 belÃ©m 

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:28.159
 if you select 

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:31.039
 September of this year this internal part bial 

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:32.049
 selected 

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:32.999
 picket 

00:03:32.999 --> 00:03:34.999
 the professional match 

00:03:34.999 --> 00:03:37.569
 then mabor of the north smile are not 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:39.199
 we agree 

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:42.199
 if you wrap it it will select 

00:03:44.809 --> 00:03:47.809
 so this team is our rita 

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:51.829
 we're going to have a little more about 

00:03:52.809 --> 00:03:54.129
 another tool 

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:57.549
 There we have a line here. 

00:03:57.549 --> 00:03:59.979
 aline then you can plot 

00:03:59.979 --> 00:04:01.899
 as you want 

00:04:01.899 --> 00:04:04.899
 you can move on to continue red 

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:11.119
 in western Libya 

00:04:11.119 --> 00:04:13.479
 I stayed 

00:04:13.479 --> 00:04:15.679
 on the red axis again 

00:04:15.679 --> 00:04:16.900
 what can you see here? 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:20.449
 when I get here near the point he automatically beans 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:25.770
 Because who did this? 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:27.870
 for you to draw your image 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:29.249
 pmt 

00:04:29.249 --> 00:04:32.249
 How did I let you close all the songs? 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:34.330
 he was already 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:37.330
 closed and already filled 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:40.309
 so look how interesting 

00:04:40.309 --> 00:04:42.770
 So what do I do now, I'll get it. 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:45.770
 in that same 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:48.159
 clicked on the end 

00:04:48.159 --> 00:04:49.569
 and I'll upload 

00:04:49.569 --> 00:04:51.090
 all shaft together 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:53.919
 to continue 

00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:56.259
 and here we have the measure that lowered 

00:04:56.259 --> 00:04:59.259
 Can you see it here in the corner? 

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:04.659
 I'm going to do the following here I'm going to make here a height of 60 

00:05:07.879 --> 00:05:08.870
 I'm staying 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:11.909
 drag a kiss 

00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:16.059
 look how interesting this sculpture here is wonderful 

00:05:17.349 --> 00:05:20.819
 when you see a possibility of realizing 

00:05:20.819 --> 00:05:22.189
 already implemented 

00:05:22.189 --> 00:05:24.770
 the maximum that can be called 

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:26.009
 imaginary 

00:05:26.009 --> 00:05:27.110
 since the thrashing 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:28.499
 here and here 

00:05:28.499 --> 00:05:30.759
 I have another point 

00:05:30.759 --> 00:05:33.650
 dabbashi down there 

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:36.650
 click here 

00:05:37.849 --> 00:05:40.849
 if you want already closed 

00:05:41.379 --> 00:05:44.120
 It's closed on your relative. 

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:46.249
 It will get more perfect. 

00:05:46.249 --> 00:05:47.919
 you can also 

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:49.430
 close in low 

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:52.900
 on duty, if the situation arises from the 

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:54.300
 stayed apart 

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:57.300
 now I'm going to close clinical score 

00:05:58.869 --> 00:06:02.610
 tavern it does not stop if it had my team that you do not 

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:06.840
 will be active is not respecting the defined line that is hit goal 

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:08.069
 the track axis 

00:06:08.069 --> 00:06:11.499
 You've won until the next point. 

00:06:11.499 --> 00:06:12.830
 up to 

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:14.020
 the next point 

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:16.960
 I left the next part 

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:19.960
 now do here 

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:26.330
 until the next point here 

00:06:30.279 --> 00:06:33.029
 This is the point that I 

00:06:33.029 --> 00:06:36.029
 He is not finding this point. 

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:39.650
 but it can be 

00:06:44.059 --> 00:06:47.059
 and now 

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:52.550
 What he did he already formed a box 

00:06:53.759 --> 00:06:56.339
 an artistic world chart 

00:06:56.339 --> 00:06:59.339
 I now if you want 

00:07:04.619 --> 00:07:07.949
 third one can

00:07:14.039 --> 00:07:15.330
 thatcher 

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:16.560
 Not only am I here. 

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:19.560
 the architect increased badly 

00:07:20.199 --> 00:07:23.199
 I'm done for the superintendent of the sima 

00:07:25.379 --> 00:07:26.469
 such 

00:07:26.469 --> 00:07:29.469
 the selected that the mobile tool of that subject 

00:07:30.029 --> 00:07:31.960
 bat that broke
