time<00:00:05.170> is<00:00:05.410> changing<00:00:06.900> that's<00:00:07.900> really<00:00:09.389> the

00:00:10.379 --> 00:00:10.389 
time is changing that's really the

00:00:10.389 --> 00:00:14.789 
time is changing that's really the
blessings<00:00:10.839> that<00:00:11.679> dad<00:00:12.959> has<00:00:13.959> been<00:00:14.169> sending<00:00:14.589> to

00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:14.799 
blessings that dad has been sending to

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:19.190 
blessings that dad has been sending to
us<00:00:14.980> and<00:00:15.570> talking<00:00:16.570> about<00:00:16.810> the<00:00:17.470> Mayan<00:00:17.710> calendar

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:19.200 
us and talking about the Mayan calendar

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.560 
us and talking about the Mayan calendar
the<00:00:20.200> Mayans<00:00:20.620> were<00:00:21.130> in<00:00:21.490> contact<00:00:22.000> with<00:00:22.420> the

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:22.570 
the Mayans were in contact with the

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:25.080 
the Mayans were in contact with the
divine<00:00:22.900> and<00:00:23.170> the<00:00:23.710> divine<00:00:24.040> told<00:00:24.370> him<00:00:24.610> about

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:25.090 
divine and the divine told him about

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:29.160 
divine and the divine told him about
what<00:00:25.450> is<00:00:25.570> going<00:00:25.780> to<00:00:25.840> happen<00:00:27.330> and<00:00:28.330> that's<00:00:28.630> all

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:29.170 
what is going to happen and that's all

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:33.029 
what is going to happen and that's all
about<00:00:29.970> calendar<00:00:30.970> calendar<00:00:31.420> is<00:00:31.810> about<00:00:32.110> time<00:00:32.439> so

00:00:33.029 --> 00:00:33.039 
about calendar calendar is about time so

00:00:33.039 --> 00:00:36.479 
about calendar calendar is about time so
we<00:00:33.219> are<00:00:33.339> living<00:00:34.059> at<00:00:34.660> the<00:00:34.780> threshold<00:00:35.160> when<00:00:36.160> time

00:00:36.479 --> 00:00:36.489 
we are living at the threshold when time

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:40.079 
we are living at the threshold when time
is<00:00:36.519> changing<00:00:37.179> that's<00:00:37.899> why<00:00:38.140> I've<00:00:38.589> been<00:00:39.089> staying

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:40.089 
is changing that's why I've been staying

00:00:40.089 --> 00:00:43.560 
is changing that's why I've been staying
in<00:00:40.390> India<00:00:40.600> just<00:00:41.499> to<00:00:41.679> prepare<00:00:42.159> for<00:00:42.550> the<00:00:43.359> time

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:43.570 
in India just to prepare for the time

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:44.520 
in India just to prepare for the time
change

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:44.530 
change

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:48.750 
change
interestingly<00:00:45.539> we<00:00:46.539> are<00:00:46.809> have<00:00:47.140> come<00:00:47.440> to<00:00:47.710> now<00:00:48.069> to

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:48.760 
interestingly we are have come to now to

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.829 
interestingly we are have come to now to
understand<00:00:49.269> things<00:00:49.719> that<00:00:50.489> we<00:00:51.489> were<00:00:51.780> unable<00:00:52.780> to

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:52.839 
understand things that we were unable to

00:00:52.839 --> 00:00:55.259 
understand things that we were unable to
understand<00:00:53.589> before<00:00:53.769> because<00:00:54.609> of<00:00:54.789> science<00:00:55.120> and

00:00:55.259 --> 00:00:55.269 
understand before because of science and

00:00:55.269 --> 00:00:57.509 
understand before because of science and
technology<00:00:55.839> but<00:00:56.260> then<00:00:56.440> the<00:00:56.589> time<00:00:56.859> is<00:00:56.890> going<00:00:57.399> to

00:00:57.509 --> 00:00:57.519 
technology but then the time is going to

00:00:57.519 --> 00:01:02.540 
technology but then the time is going to
tell<00:00:57.729> us<00:00:57.760> more<00:00:57.909> about<00:01:00.359> nature<00:01:01.359> about

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
tell us more about nature about

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.149 
tell us more about nature about
intelligence<00:01:03.550> that<00:01:04.390> we<00:01:04.570> can<00:01:04.750> know<00:01:05.159> everything

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:06.159 
intelligence that we can know everything

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:09.569 
intelligence that we can know everything
that<00:01:06.670> we<00:01:07.420> can<00:01:07.630> do<00:01:07.869> everything<00:01:08.259> we<00:01:08.710> can<00:01:09.340> be

00:01:09.569 --> 00:01:09.579 
that we can do everything we can be

00:01:09.579 --> 00:01:11.969 
that we can do everything we can be
everywhere<00:01:10.270> all<00:01:10.600> this<00:01:11.290> is<00:01:11.469> going<00:01:11.680> to<00:01:11.799> happen

00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:11.979 
everywhere all this is going to happen

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:15.209 
everywhere all this is going to happen
in<00:01:12.579> the<00:01:12.790> golden<00:01:13.119> age<00:01:13.240> I<00:01:13.770> started<00:01:14.770> with<00:01:14.920> talking

00:01:15.209 --> 00:01:15.219 
in the golden age I started with talking

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:19.469 
in the golden age I started with talking
about<00:01:15.460> time<00:01:15.939> change<00:01:16.329> the<00:01:17.289> god<00:01:17.590> of<00:01:18.070> time<00:01:18.520> is

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:19.479 
about time change the god of time is

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:22.649 
about time change the god of time is
being<00:01:19.899> gone<00:01:20.380> on<00:01:20.710> December<00:01:21.189> 6th<00:01:21.640> it's<00:01:22.360> a<00:01:22.450> very

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:22.659 
being gone on December 6th it's a very

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:24.840 
being gone on December 6th it's a very
important<00:01:23.229> time<00:01:23.469> is<00:01:24.100> there<00:01:24.280> a<00:01:24.310> god<00:01:24.520> of<00:01:24.640> time

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:24.850 
important time is there a god of time

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:28.410 
important time is there a god of time
yes<00:01:25.390> there<00:01:26.380> is<00:01:26.560> one<00:01:26.770> and<00:01:27.039> he<00:01:27.640> manufactures

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:28.420 
yes there is one and he manufactures

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:30.179 
yes there is one and he manufactures
time<00:01:28.780> not<00:01:29.079> only<00:01:29.109> for<00:01:29.350> the<00:01:29.619> earth<00:01:29.740> plane<00:01:29.979> he

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:30.189 
time not only for the earth plane he

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:33.209 
time not only for the earth plane he
manufactures<00:01:30.850> time<00:01:31.289> for<00:01:32.289> all<00:01:32.380> the<00:01:32.619> galaxies

00:01:33.209 --> 00:01:33.219 
manufactures time for all the galaxies

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:36.300 
manufactures time for all the galaxies
different<00:01:33.939> galaxies<00:01:34.590> have<00:01:35.590> different<00:01:36.039> time

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:36.310 
different galaxies have different time

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:39.679 
different galaxies have different time
matrix<00:01:36.899> the<00:01:37.899> time<00:01:38.140> matrix<00:01:38.350> is<00:01:38.859> dependent<00:01:39.399> on

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
matrix the time matrix is dependent on

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:43.980 
matrix the time matrix is dependent on
the<00:01:40.689> vibrations<00:01:41.350> of<00:01:41.799> the<00:01:42.670> planet<00:01:43.090> we<00:01:43.750> vibrate

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:43.990 
the vibrations of the planet we vibrate

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:49.050 
the vibrations of the planet we vibrate
at<00:01:44.829> a<00:01:44.859> very<00:01:45.130> low<00:01:45.399> speed<00:01:46.229> so<00:01:47.229> time<00:01:47.590> is<00:01:48.060> prolonged

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.060 
at a very low speed so time is prolonged

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.569 
at a very low speed so time is prolonged
and<00:01:49.810> this<00:01:50.850> birth<00:01:51.850> of<00:01:52.179> the<00:01:52.479> god<00:01:52.750> of<00:01:52.780> time<00:01:53.109> and

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
and this birth of the god of time and

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.310 
and this birth of the god of time and
December<00:01:54.579> 6th<00:01:54.909> is<00:01:55.119> going<00:01:55.420> to<00:01:55.539> change<00:01:55.750> because

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:56.320 
December 6th is going to change because

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.609 
December 6th is going to change because
he<00:01:56.350> knows<00:01:56.880> that<00:01:57.880> the<00:01:58.149> earth<00:01:58.600> plane<00:01:58.960> is<00:01:59.200> picking

00:01:59.609 --> 00:01:59.619 
he knows that the earth plane is picking

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:02.789 
he knows that the earth plane is picking
up<00:01:59.770> a<00:02:00.070> different<00:02:00.909> vibration<00:02:01.090> and<00:02:01.810> he<00:02:02.409> has<00:02:02.560> to

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:02.799 
up a different vibration and he has to

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:05.069 
up a different vibration and he has to
manufacture<00:02:03.490> time<00:02:03.759> in<00:02:03.939> a<00:02:04.030> different<00:02:04.210> way<00:02:04.630> so

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:05.079 
manufacture time in a different way so

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:08.339 
manufacture time in a different way so
that<00:02:05.619> we<00:02:05.770> don't<00:02:05.799> have<00:02:06.189> to<00:02:06.369> wait<00:02:06.640> forever<00:02:07.349> I'm

00:02:08.339 --> 00:02:08.349 
that we don't have to wait forever I'm

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:08.809 
that we don't have to wait forever I'm
going<00:02:08.619> to

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
going to

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:12.500 
going to
do<00:02:08.909> a<00:02:09.239> webcast<00:02:09.840> on<00:02:10.469> that<00:02:10.709> what<00:02:11.519> is<00:02:11.819> time

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
do a webcast on that what is time

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.129 
do a webcast on that what is time
our<00:02:13.139> kinds<00:02:13.530> of<00:02:13.650> time<00:02:14.519> have<00:02:14.909> changed<00:02:15.139> Newton

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:16.139 
our kinds of time have changed Newton

00:02:16.139 --> 00:02:17.890 
our kinds of time have changed Newton
thought<00:02:16.349> that<00:02:16.620> time<00:02:16.889> is<00:02:17.069> absolute<00:02:17.639> and

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
thought that time is absolute and

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.869 
thought that time is absolute and
Einstein<00:02:18.900> came<00:02:19.200> and<00:02:19.439> proved<00:02:19.739> he's<00:02:20.189> wrong

00:02:20.869 --> 00:02:20.879 
Einstein came and proved he's wrong

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:24.379 
Einstein came and proved he's wrong
time<00:02:21.840> is<00:02:22.019> relative<00:02:22.290> but<00:02:23.249> now<00:02:23.519> the<00:02:23.579> birth<00:02:24.150> of

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:24.389 
time is relative but now the birth of

00:02:24.389 --> 00:02:27.309 
time is relative but now the birth of
kalabairava<00:02:25.049> is<00:02:25.530> going<00:02:25.829> to<00:02:26.010> move<00:02:26.280> further

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:27.319 
kalabairava is going to move further

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:30.709 
kalabairava is going to move further
than<00:02:28.319> Einstein<00:02:28.950> taking<00:02:29.730> time<00:02:30.180> out<00:02:30.420> of<00:02:30.629> the
