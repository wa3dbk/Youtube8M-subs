you<00:00:08.490> don't<00:00:08.519> mind<00:00:08.760> me<00:00:08.910> doing<00:00:09.179> this<00:00:09.269> is<00:00:09.450> the

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
you don't mind me doing this is the

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.030 
you don't mind me doing this is the
easiest<00:00:09.900> way<00:00:10.139> for<00:00:10.170> me<00:00:10.440> to<00:00:10.469> describe<00:00:10.830> the

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
easiest way for me to describe the

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.740 
easiest way for me to describe the
system<00:00:11.250> to<00:00:11.610> you<00:00:11.730> that<00:00:11.940> I'm<00:00:12.210> thinking<00:00:12.360> about

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
system to you that I'm thinking about

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.120 
system to you that I'm thinking about
using<00:00:13.019> just<00:00:13.950> simply<00:00:14.280> because<00:00:14.929> you're<00:00:16.130> you're

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
using just simply because you're you're

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.250 
using just simply because you're you're
labeled<00:00:17.520> you<00:00:17.580> have<00:00:17.699> such<00:00:17.880> a<00:00:17.910> low<00:00:18.270> quantity<00:00:18.779> of

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
labeled you have such a low quantity of

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.679 
labeled you have such a low quantity of
labels<00:00:20.070> and<00:00:20.250> probably<00:00:20.730> a<00:00:20.760> lot<00:00:21.029> of<00:00:21.180> changes

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
labels and probably a lot of changes

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.060 
labels and probably a lot of changes
that<00:00:21.720> if<00:00:22.050> I<00:00:22.140> ever<00:00:22.289> try<00:00:22.500> to<00:00:22.529> take<00:00:22.740> that<00:00:22.920> to

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
that if I ever try to take that to

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.160 
that if I ever try to take that to
impress<00:00:23.400> the<00:00:23.609> cost<00:00:23.850> would<00:00:24.060> be<00:00:24.119> prohibited<00:00:24.960> so

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
impress the cost would be prohibited so

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.220 
impress the cost would be prohibited so
I'm<00:00:25.650> looking<00:00:25.980> to<00:00:26.150> produce<00:00:27.150> a<00:00:27.480> label<00:00:27.810> for<00:00:28.019> you

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
I'm looking to produce a label for you

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.380 
I'm looking to produce a label for you
at<00:00:28.529> the<00:00:28.650> lowest<00:00:28.859> cost<00:00:29.250> possible<00:00:29.550> but<00:00:30.150> give<00:00:30.330> you

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
at the lowest cost possible but give you

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.370 
at the lowest cost possible but give you
the<00:00:30.449> highest<00:00:30.890> quality<00:00:32.030> and<00:00:33.030> a<00:00:33.809> couple<00:00:34.290> things

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
the highest quality and a couple things

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.979 
the highest quality and a couple things
I<00:00:34.500> wanted<00:00:34.710> to<00:00:34.890> show<00:00:35.340> you<00:00:35.370> first<00:00:35.700> this<00:00:36.630> was<00:00:36.840> the

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
I wanted to show you first this was the

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.740 
I wanted to show you first this was the
original<00:00:37.079> artwork<00:00:37.920> that<00:00:38.129> I<00:00:38.219> did<00:00:38.430> here<00:00:38.730> and<00:00:39.540> I'm

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
original artwork that I did here and I'm

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.369 
original artwork that I did here and I'm
hoping<00:00:39.960> you<00:00:40.170> can<00:00:40.219> you<00:00:41.219> can<00:00:41.430> see<00:00:41.700> that<00:00:42.320> in<00:00:43.320> fact

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
hoping you can you can see that in fact

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.170 
hoping you can you can see that in fact
I've<00:00:43.680> moved<00:00:43.950> one<00:00:44.160> person<00:00:44.579> thing<00:00:44.760> it's<00:00:44.910> a<00:00:44.969> new

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
I've moved one person thing it's a new

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.049 
I've moved one person thing it's a new
setup<00:00:45.450> for<00:00:45.750> us<00:00:45.840> we've<00:00:46.260> been<00:00:46.410> trying<00:00:46.680> to<00:00:46.770> use

00:00:47.049 --> 00:00:47.059 
setup for us we've been trying to use

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:49.910 
setup for us we've been trying to use
video<00:00:48.059> editing<00:00:48.629> as<00:00:48.750> well<00:00:48.780> as<00:00:49.020> our<00:00:49.140> website<00:00:49.350> so

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
video editing as well as our website so

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.220 
video editing as well as our website so
I<00:00:50.190> actually<00:00:50.579> use<00:00:50.820> it<00:00:50.850> as<00:00:51.059> a<00:00:51.149> practice<00:00:51.600> but<00:00:51.840> you

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
I actually use it as a practice but you

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.869 
I actually use it as a practice but you
can<00:00:52.410> see<00:00:52.530> the<00:00:52.649> quality<00:00:52.890> there<00:00:53.399> and<00:00:53.670> then<00:00:53.760> when

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
can see the quality there and then when

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.330 
can see the quality there and then when
I<00:00:53.910> lay<00:00:54.090> the<00:00:54.270> label<00:00:54.719> next<00:00:55.500> way<00:00:55.800> you<00:00:55.860> can<00:00:56.129> see

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
I lay the label next way you can see

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.580 
I lay the label next way you can see
where<00:00:56.579> it's<00:00:57.120> somewhat<00:00:57.570> looks<00:00:58.170> a<00:00:58.260> little<00:00:58.379> bit

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
where it's somewhat looks a little bit

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.490 
where it's somewhat looks a little bit
different<00:00:58.980> because<00:00:59.070> it<00:00:59.399> is<00:00:59.550> it<00:01:00.300> is<00:01:00.329> somewhat<00:01:01.230> a

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
different because it is it is somewhat a

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.850 
different because it is it is somewhat a
little<00:01:02.010> bit<00:01:02.160> lighter<00:01:02.430> or<00:01:02.879> faded<00:01:03.690> out<00:01:03.809> but<00:01:04.080> at

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
little bit lighter or faded out but at

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.440 
little bit lighter or faded out but at
the<00:01:04.979> same<00:01:05.159> time<00:01:05.369> it's<00:01:05.580> still<00:01:05.790> very<00:01:06.090> nice

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
the same time it's still very nice

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.469 
the same time it's still very nice
quality<00:01:07.350> and<00:01:07.470> so<00:01:07.650> forth<00:01:07.979> but<00:01:08.939> if<00:01:09.030> I<00:01:09.119> had<00:01:09.270> to<00:01:09.360> go

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
quality and so forth but if I had to go

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.630 
quality and so forth but if I had to go
to<00:01:09.540> a<00:01:09.600> press<00:01:09.990> I<00:01:10.200> probably<00:01:10.439> have<00:01:10.830> to<00:01:11.010> use<00:01:11.040> make

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
to a press I probably have to use make

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.480 
to a press I probably have to use make
plates<00:01:11.939> and<00:01:12.299> that's<00:01:12.479> four<00:01:13.170> plates<00:01:13.470> plus<00:01:13.920> so<00:01:14.369> it

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
plates and that's four plates plus so it

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.399 
plates and that's four plates plus so it
could<00:01:14.640> be<00:01:14.729> up<00:01:14.820> to<00:01:14.850> six<00:01:15.150> plates<00:01:15.479> on<00:01:15.689> this<00:01:15.840> plate

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
could be up to six plates on this plate

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.830 
could be up to six plates on this plate
cost<00:01:16.680> or<00:01:16.920> somewhere<00:01:17.189> around<00:01:17.250> $90<00:01:18.119> each<00:01:18.330> so<00:01:18.600> for

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
cost or somewhere around $90 each so for

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.390 
cost or somewhere around $90 each so for
every<00:01:19.250> every<00:01:21.020> label<00:01:22.020> you<00:01:22.259> would<00:01:22.439> need<00:01:22.680> just<00:01:23.310> a

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
every every label you would need just a

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.039 
every every label you would need just a
plate<00:01:23.610> costs<00:01:24.030> alone<00:01:24.240> would<00:01:24.450> start<00:01:24.689> to<00:01:24.780> be<00:01:24.869> like

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
plate costs alone would start to be like

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.960 
plate costs alone would start to be like
four<00:01:25.320> or<00:01:25.380> five<00:01:25.409> hundred<00:01:25.710> hours<00:01:26.159> and<00:01:26.400> then<00:01:26.490> plus

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
four or five hundred hours and then plus

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.399 
four or five hundred hours and then plus
the<00:01:27.000> quantity<00:01:27.330> labels<00:01:27.900> there<00:01:28.140> would<00:01:28.259> always

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
the quantity labels there would always

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.740 
the quantity labels there would always
be<00:01:28.560> minimums<00:01:29.159> of<00:01:29.340> thousands<00:01:29.850> upon<00:01:30.119> thousands

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
be minimums of thousands upon thousands

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.319 
be minimums of thousands upon thousands
so<00:01:30.960> this<00:01:31.500> will<00:01:31.710> probably<00:01:32.159> be<00:01:32.340> the<00:01:32.520> setup<00:01:33.030> that

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
so this will probably be the setup that

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.330 
so this will probably be the setup that
I<00:01:33.360> would<00:01:33.630> use<00:01:34.229> but<00:01:34.560> let<00:01:34.740> me<00:01:34.829> tell<00:01:34.979> you<00:01:35.040> why<00:01:35.310> I

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
I would use but let me tell you why I

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.190 
I would use but let me tell you why I
think<00:01:35.490> it'd<00:01:35.820> be<00:01:35.850> more<00:01:36.240> advantageous<00:01:36.479> to<00:01:37.020> use

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
think it'd be more advantageous to use

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.030 
think it'd be more advantageous to use
something<00:01:37.500> like<00:01:37.680> this<00:01:38.509> this<00:01:39.509> here<00:01:39.780> is<00:01:39.930> a<00:01:40.040> is

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
something like this this here is a is

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.490 
something like this this here is a is
called<00:01:41.280> a<00:01:41.460> 3400<00:01:42.329> secure<00:01:42.630> color<00:01:42.869> printer<00:01:43.290> and

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
called a 3400 secure color printer and

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.950 
called a 3400 secure color printer and
it's<00:01:43.619> a<00:01:43.770> just<00:01:44.070> a<00:01:44.159> regular<00:01:44.689> computer<00:01:45.689> that<00:01:45.899> I'm

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
it's a just a regular computer that I'm

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.020 
it's a just a regular computer that I'm
using<00:01:46.200> and<00:01:46.710> it<00:01:46.829> is<00:01:46.979> a<00:01:47.009> label<00:01:47.280> formatting

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
using and it is a label formatting

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.690 
using and it is a label formatting
software<00:01:48.540> package<00:01:49.159> this<00:01:50.159> is<00:01:50.220> something<00:01:50.670> that

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
software package this is something that

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.929 
software package this is something that
we<00:01:51.000> actually<00:01:51.360> sell<00:01:51.659> to<00:01:52.110> customers<00:01:52.460> were<00:01:53.460> using

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
we actually sell to customers were using

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.569 
we actually sell to customers were using
it<00:01:54.240> now<00:01:54.450> to<00:01:54.479> do<00:01:55.020> small<00:01:55.680> runs<00:01:55.979> because<00:01:56.310> we're<00:01:56.490> in

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
it now to do small runs because we're in

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:57.950 
it now to do small runs because we're in
an<00:01:56.640> economy<00:01:56.909> where<00:01:57.270> a<00:01:57.329> lot<00:01:57.540> of<00:01:57.570> people<00:01:57.899> are

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
an economy where a lot of people are

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:58.440 
an economy where a lot of people are
doing

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:58.450 
doing

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:00.539 
doing
businesses<00:01:59.140> and<00:01:59.350> so<00:01:59.829> forth<00:01:59.860> and<00:02:00.280> this<00:02:00.369> is

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:00.549 
businesses and so forth and this is

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:02.279 
businesses and so forth and this is
probably<00:02:00.820> the<00:02:00.909> easiest<00:02:00.969> way<00:02:01.390> to<00:02:01.420> generate<00:02:01.930> a

00:02:02.279 --> 00:02:02.289 
probably the easiest way to generate a

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:05.399 
probably the easiest way to generate a
lately<00:02:03.219> I<00:02:03.430> first<00:02:03.939> I<00:02:04.119> pick<00:02:04.299> the<00:02:04.479> size<00:02:04.689> as<00:02:05.170> you

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:05.409 
lately I first I pick the size as you

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:08.400 
lately I first I pick the size as you
can<00:02:05.590> see<00:02:05.829> I<00:02:06.070> pick<00:02:06.729> the<00:02:06.880> size<00:02:07.090> that<00:02:07.509> would<00:02:07.780> and

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:08.410 
can see I pick the size that would and

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:10.020 
can see I pick the size that would and
I'm<00:02:08.500> hoping<00:02:08.800> you<00:02:08.920> can<00:02:09.129> see<00:02:09.310> this<00:02:09.489> and<00:02:09.729> some<00:02:09.910> by

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
I'm hoping you can see this and some by

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.520 
I'm hoping you can see this and some by
myself<00:02:10.420> it<00:02:10.539> would<00:02:11.050> fit<00:02:11.260> both<00:02:12.330> candles<00:02:13.530> the

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
myself it would fit both candles the

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:16.500 
myself it would fit both candles the
size<00:02:14.739> this<00:02:15.069> actually<00:02:15.400> has<00:02:15.519> a<00:02:15.550> cutter<00:02:15.880> on<00:02:16.120> it<00:02:16.300> so

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
size this actually has a cutter on it so

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.120 
size this actually has a cutter on it so
makes<00:02:17.050> it<00:02:17.200> kind<00:02:17.380> of<00:02:17.440> nice<00:02:17.590> but<00:02:17.800> you<00:02:17.890> can<00:02:18.010> see

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130 
makes it kind of nice but you can see

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:19.530 
makes it kind of nice but you can see
the<00:02:18.250> curvature<00:02:18.519> you're<00:02:18.910> going<00:02:19.060> to<00:02:19.150> get<00:02:19.269> on<00:02:19.420> the

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
the curvature you're going to get on the

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.920 
the curvature you're going to get on the
one<00:02:19.750> whereas<00:02:20.470> when<00:02:20.680> you<00:02:20.769> get<00:02:20.920> into<00:02:21.220> the<00:02:21.930> into

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
one whereas when you get into the into

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.140 
one whereas when you get into the into
the<00:02:23.110> larger<00:02:23.860> one<00:02:24.069> it<00:02:24.519> actually<00:02:24.670> looks<00:02:25.060> a

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
the larger one it actually looks a

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:26.970 
the larger one it actually looks a
little<00:02:25.180> bit<00:02:25.420> better<00:02:25.720> I'm<00:02:26.440> gonna<00:02:26.620> come<00:02:26.799> over

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
little bit better I'm gonna come over

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:28.470 
little bit better I'm gonna come over
here<00:02:27.010> so<00:02:27.280> I<00:02:27.310> can<00:02:27.340> actually<00:02:27.610> show<00:02:27.940> this<00:02:28.120> to<00:02:28.360> you

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
here so I can actually show this to you

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.539 
here so I can actually show this to you
a<00:02:28.510> little<00:02:28.750> bit<00:02:28.870> better<00:02:29.110> it<00:02:29.739> actually<00:02:29.769> fits<00:02:30.340> the

00:02:30.539 --> 00:02:30.549 
a little bit better it actually fits the

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:33.960 
a little bit better it actually fits the
candle<00:02:31.330> much<00:02:31.930> better<00:02:32.310> all<00:02:33.310> the<00:02:33.519> way<00:02:33.640> around

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
candle much better all the way around

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:36.780 
candle much better all the way around
and<00:02:34.120> so<00:02:34.330> forth<00:02:34.690> and<00:02:35.349> if<00:02:35.530> you<00:02:35.650> had<00:02:35.799> to<00:02:36.069> peel<00:02:36.610> the

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
and so forth and if you had to peel the

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:41.580 
and so forth and if you had to peel the
label<00:02:38.849> right<00:02:39.849> here<00:02:40.209> on<00:02:40.720> the<00:02:40.870> end<00:02:41.019> this<00:02:41.380> is

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
label right here on the end this is

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:44.520 
label right here on the end this is
where<00:02:41.739> you<00:02:41.860> would<00:02:42.040> actually<00:02:42.190> pull<00:02:42.670> it<00:02:42.819> to<00:02:43.530> take

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
where you would actually pull it to take

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:46.380 
where you would actually pull it to take
it<00:02:44.560> apart<00:02:44.890> and<00:02:45.160> actually<00:02:45.310> stick<00:02:45.700> it<00:02:45.819> onto<00:02:46.000> the

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
it apart and actually stick it onto the

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:48.330 
it apart and actually stick it onto the
product<00:02:46.959> itself<00:02:47.380> hopefully<00:02:47.680> you<00:02:47.980> can<00:02:48.099> see

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
product itself hopefully you can see

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.430 
product itself hopefully you can see
that<00:02:48.549> so<00:02:48.849> but<00:02:49.780> let<00:02:49.930> me<00:02:50.019> show<00:02:50.140> you<00:02:50.200> how<00:02:50.380> to

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
that so but let me show you how to

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.380 
that so but let me show you how to
change<00:02:50.739> it<00:02:50.890> once<00:02:51.069> I<00:02:51.220> have<00:02:51.370> the<00:02:51.519> format<00:02:51.970> once<00:02:52.239> we

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
change it once I have the format once we

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:55.380 
change it once I have the format once we
get<00:02:52.480> the<00:02:52.660> format<00:02:53.049> set<00:02:53.430> as<00:02:54.430> an<00:02:54.640> example<00:02:55.120> I<00:02:55.209> can

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
get the format set as an example I can

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:57.900 
get the format set as an example I can
print<00:02:55.630> a<00:02:55.720> label<00:02:55.900> that<00:02:56.410> has<00:02:57.099> the<00:02:57.430> fragrance

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 
print a label that has the fragrance

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:59.550 
print a label that has the fragrance
that<00:02:58.390> I've<00:02:58.540> just<00:02:58.750> put<00:02:58.930> anything<00:02:59.200> in<00:02:59.440> light

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
that I've just put anything in light

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.350 
that I've just put anything in light
mint<00:02:59.860> I<00:02:59.950> got<00:03:00.130> three<00:03:00.370> ounces<00:03:00.790> but<00:03:01.000> let's<00:03:01.209> say

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 
mint I got three ounces but let's say

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.340 
mint I got three ounces but let's say
you<00:03:01.989> wanted<00:03:02.349> to<00:03:03.269> actually<00:03:04.269> change<00:03:04.900> it<00:03:05.139> you

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:05.350 
you wanted to actually change it you

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:07.349 
you wanted to actually change it you
want<00:03:05.590> to<00:03:05.739> call<00:03:05.980> this<00:03:06.220> I'm<00:03:06.819> picking<00:03:07.209> any

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:07.359 
want to call this I'm picking any

00:03:07.359 --> 00:03:09.960 
want to call this I'm picking any
meaning<00:03:07.750> once<00:03:08.019> again<00:03:08.260> I<00:03:08.319> understand<00:03:08.970> you're

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
meaning once again I understand you're

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:11.789 
meaning once again I understand you're
still<00:03:10.090> in<00:03:10.269> the<00:03:10.329> process<00:03:10.359> of<00:03:10.930> picking<00:03:11.440> this<00:03:11.650> but

00:03:11.789 --> 00:03:11.799 
still in the process of picking this but

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:14.759 
still in the process of picking this but
let's<00:03:11.950> call<00:03:12.130> it<00:03:12.190> clean<00:03:12.519> linen<00:03:13.290> and<00:03:14.290> let's<00:03:14.650> say

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:14.769 
let's call it clean linen and let's say

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:16.500 
let's call it clean linen and let's say
well<00:03:14.950> the<00:03:15.069> way<00:03:15.400> the<00:03:15.639> candle<00:03:16.030> was<00:03:16.090> going<00:03:16.329> to<00:03:16.389> be

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
well the way the candle was going to be

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:20.720 
well the way the candle was going to be
four<00:03:17.079> ounces<00:03:17.530> so<00:03:18.280> we'll<00:03:18.430> change<00:03:18.670> it<00:03:18.790> to<00:03:18.940> four

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
four ounces so we'll change it to four

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:23.099 
four ounces so we'll change it to four
will<00:03:21.730> click<00:03:21.940> off<00:03:22.180> of<00:03:22.209> that<00:03:22.510> will<00:03:22.780> just<00:03:22.959> say

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:23.109 
will click off of that will just say

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:25.050 
will click off of that will just say
file<00:03:23.410> print<00:03:23.920> hopefully<00:03:24.459> you<00:03:24.549> can<00:03:24.700> see<00:03:24.850> on<00:03:24.970> the

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.060 
file print hopefully you can see on the

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:26.460 
file print hopefully you can see on the
screen<00:03:25.180> where<00:03:25.540> I<00:03:25.569> could<00:03:25.750> pick<00:03:25.900> the<00:03:26.019> quantity

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 
screen where I could pick the quantity

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:30.050 
screen where I could pick the quantity
let's<00:03:27.100> say<00:03:27.220> I<00:03:27.250> pick<00:03:27.489> two<00:03:27.760> I<00:03:28.440> can<00:03:29.440> pick<00:03:29.590> two

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
let's say I pick two I can pick two

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.520 
let's say I pick two I can pick two
labels<00:03:31.060> like<00:03:31.239> that<00:03:31.480> and<00:03:31.780> you<00:03:32.139> can<00:03:32.319> probably

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.530 
labels like that and you can probably

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:34.880 
labels like that and you can probably
hear<00:03:32.920> the<00:03:33.130> printer<00:03:33.730> and<00:03:33.910> I'm<00:03:33.970> gonna

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
hear the printer and I'm gonna

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:37.880 
hear the printer and I'm gonna
jeez<00:03:35.069> you<00:03:35.340> mean<00:03:35.580> here<00:03:35.790> a<00:03:35.819> little<00:03:36.000> bit<00:03:36.270> to<00:03:37.230> show

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:37.890 
jeez you mean here a little bit to show

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:47.260 
jeez you mean here a little bit to show
you

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:47.270 

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:49.300 

and<00:03:47.630> I'm<00:03:47.750> assuming<00:03:48.020> you'll<00:03:48.620> be<00:03:48.770> able<00:03:48.860> to<00:03:49.100> see

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:49.310 
and I'm assuming you'll be able to see

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:52.600 
and I'm assuming you'll be able to see
that<00:03:49.520> so<00:03:50.080> you<00:03:51.080> can<00:03:51.470> see<00:03:51.500> where<00:03:51.800> the<00:03:51.950> labels

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:52.610 
that so you can see where the labels

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:54.190 
that so you can see where the labels
actually<00:03:52.970> come<00:03:53.150> out<00:03:53.180> of<00:03:53.330> the<00:03:53.510> printer

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:54.200 
actually come out of the printer

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:57.550 
actually come out of the printer
and<00:03:55.600> just<00:03:56.600> to<00:03:56.720> show<00:03:56.870> you<00:03:56.960> the<00:03:57.110> reading<00:03:57.410> matter

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:57.560 
and just to show you the reading matter

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:59.620 
and just to show you the reading matter
once<00:03:57.860> again<00:03:58.130> with<00:03:58.250> the<00:03:58.370> two<00:03:58.550> labels<00:03:59.420> that<00:03:59.510> we

00:03:59.620 --> 00:03:59.630 
once again with the two labels that we

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:01.930 
once again with the two labels that we
just<00:03:59.840> printed<00:04:00.140> we<00:04:00.890> changed<00:04:01.280> it<00:04:01.430> very<00:04:01.640> quickly

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:01.940 
just printed we changed it very quickly

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:06.030 
just printed we changed it very quickly
so<00:04:02.360> that<00:04:02.390> the<00:04:02.920> four<00:04:03.920> ounces<00:04:04.310> is<00:04:04.520> now<00:04:04.670> on<00:04:04.940> there

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:06.040 
so that the four ounces is now on there

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.440 
so that the four ounces is now on there
but<00:04:07.040> you<00:04:07.190> can<00:04:07.370> see<00:04:07.460> that<00:04:07.610> the<00:04:07.730> four<00:04:07.940> ounces<00:04:08.060> is

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:08.450 
but you can see that the four ounces is

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:10.660 
but you can see that the four ounces is
not<00:04:08.690> one<00:04:08.930> here<00:04:09.170> as<00:04:09.320> well<00:04:09.530> as<00:04:09.620> the<00:04:09.740> clean<00:04:10.310> linen

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:10.670 
not one here as well as the clean linen

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:13.540 
not one here as well as the clean linen
but<00:04:11.510> that's<00:04:11.720> very<00:04:11.990> quick<00:04:12.500> now<00:04:12.800> the<00:04:13.100> downside

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:13.550 
but that's very quick now the downside

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:16.240 
but that's very quick now the downside
of<00:04:14.090> this<00:04:14.210> is<00:04:14.480> with<00:04:14.660> this<00:04:14.840> package<00:04:15.170> there<00:04:16.160> are

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:16.250 
of this is with this package there are

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:17.710 
of this is with this package there are
certain<00:04:16.520> things<00:04:16.760> you<00:04:16.880> have<00:04:16.910> to<00:04:17.090> live<00:04:17.420> with<00:04:17.450> you

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:17.720 
certain things you have to live with you

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:19.090 
certain things you have to live with you
have<00:04:17.870> to<00:04:18.020> live<00:04:18.200> with<00:04:18.320> the<00:04:18.440> borders<00:04:18.890> it's

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:19.100 
have to live with the borders it's

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:21.670 
have to live with the borders it's
inherent<00:04:19.820> to<00:04:20.030> the<00:04:20.180> software<00:04:20.930> package<00:04:21.320> itself

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:21.680 
inherent to the software package itself

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:23.770 
inherent to the software package itself
so<00:04:22.220> I<00:04:22.280> can't<00:04:22.610> take<00:04:22.850> the<00:04:22.970> graphics<00:04:23.450> right<00:04:23.600> to

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:23.780 
so I can't take the graphics right to

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:25.690 
so I can't take the graphics right to
the<00:04:23.900> ends<00:04:24.080> left<00:04:24.800> the<00:04:24.950> right<00:04:25.100> top<00:04:25.370> to<00:04:25.400> bottom

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:25.700 
the ends left the right top to bottom

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:29.140 
the ends left the right top to bottom
and<00:04:26.090> at<00:04:26.630> the<00:04:26.750> same<00:04:26.930> time<00:04:27.200> mmm

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:29.150 
and at the same time mmm

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:31.000 
and at the same time mmm
there<00:04:29.480> are<00:04:29.660> certain<00:04:29.990> fonts<00:04:30.470> that<00:04:30.500> you<00:04:30.740> can't

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:31.010 
there are certain fonts that you can't

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:32.800 
there are certain fonts that you can't
do<00:04:31.250> if<00:04:31.370> you<00:04:31.460> look<00:04:31.580> at<00:04:31.730> that<00:04:31.880> w<00:04:32.330> that's<00:04:32.570> not

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:32.810 
do if you look at that w that's not

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:38.470 
do if you look at that w that's not
exactly<00:04:33.170> the<00:04:33.470> W<00:04:34.100> that<00:04:35.380> that<00:04:36.380> you<00:04:36.560> had<00:04:37.090> on<00:04:38.090> the

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:38.480 
exactly the W that that you had on the

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:40.060 
exactly the W that that you had on the
artwork<00:04:38.990> that<00:04:39.230> I<00:04:39.350> showed<00:04:39.590> you<00:04:39.770> and<00:04:39.890> the<00:04:39.950> reason

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:40.070 
artwork that I showed you and the reason

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:41.860 
artwork that I showed you and the reason
why<00:04:40.310> is<00:04:40.370> because<00:04:40.460> the<00:04:40.940> system<00:04:41.150> is<00:04:41.450> not<00:04:41.600> capable

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:41.870 
why is because the system is not capable

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:46.230 
why is because the system is not capable
I'm<00:04:42.710> trying<00:04:43.100> to<00:04:43.160> get<00:04:43.280> this<00:04:43.400> focused<00:04:43.820> in<00:04:43.970> here

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:46.240 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:49.740 

yeah<00:04:47.240> that<00:04:47.450> W<00:04:47.960> is<00:04:48.110> not<00:04:48.320> exactly<00:04:48.890> how<00:04:49.010> you<00:04:49.190> would

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:49.750 
yeah that W is not exactly how you would

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:52.600 
yeah that W is not exactly how you would
have<00:04:50.750> it<00:04:50.990> one<00:04:51.530> yard<00:04:51.800> work<00:04:51.980> that<00:04:52.160> I<00:04:52.190> did<00:04:52.280> just

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:52.610 
have it one yard work that I did just

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:54.400 
have it one yard work that I did just
simply<00:04:52.820> because<00:04:53.000> that<00:04:53.330> software<00:04:53.750> package<00:04:54.260> is

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:54.410 
simply because that software package is

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:57.450 
simply because that software package is
not<00:04:54.590> capable<00:04:54.980> of<00:04:55.400> producing<00:04:56.240> the<00:04:56.540> kind<00:04:56.780> of<00:04:56.870> W

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:57.460 
not capable of producing the kind of W

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:00.010 
not capable of producing the kind of W
that<00:04:58.460> you<00:04:58.610> would<00:04:58.790> want<00:04:59.000> so<00:04:59.240> if<00:04:59.450> those<00:04:59.630> are<00:04:59.690> some

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:00.020 
that you would want so if those are some

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:02.170 
that you would want so if those are some
things<00:05:00.260> that<00:05:00.350> you<00:05:00.500> neither<00:05:00.650> have<00:05:00.860> to<00:05:01.250> you'd

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:02.180 
things that you neither have to you'd

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:03.820 
things that you neither have to you'd
have<00:05:02.330> to<00:05:02.510> somewhat<00:05:03.080> live<00:05:03.320> with<00:05:03.560> but

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:03.830 
have to somewhat live with but

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:06.790 
have to somewhat live with but
ultimately<00:05:04.790> it's<00:05:05.540> about<00:05:05.690> the<00:05:06.020> easiest<00:05:06.500> and

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:06.800 
ultimately it's about the easiest and

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:10.930 
ultimately it's about the easiest and
cleanest<00:05:07.250> way<00:05:07.930> to<00:05:08.930> do<00:05:09.110> this<00:05:09.260> now<00:05:09.560> I<00:05:09.860> think<00:05:10.070> once

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:10.940 
cleanest way to do this now I think once

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:13.240 
cleanest way to do this now I think once
again<00:05:11.270> what's<00:05:11.570> nice<00:05:11.810> about<00:05:11.840> this<00:05:12.350> system<00:05:12.830> is<00:05:13.010> I

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:13.250 
again what's nice about this system is I

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:15.520 
again what's nice about this system is I
can<00:05:14.150> go<00:05:14.300> ahead<00:05:14.390> and<00:05:14.660> print<00:05:14.870> these<00:05:15.080> labels

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:15.530 
can go ahead and print these labels

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:17.620 
can go ahead and print these labels
using<00:05:15.980> this<00:05:16.310> and<00:05:16.550> doing<00:05:16.700> the<00:05:16.850> formatting<00:05:17.450> but

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:17.630 
using this and doing the formatting but

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:19.390 
using this and doing the formatting but
if<00:05:17.750> you<00:05:17.870> ever<00:05:17.990> got<00:05:18.290> that<00:05:18.560> large<00:05:18.830> enough<00:05:19.190> and

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:19.400 
if you ever got that large enough and

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:21.010 
if you ever got that large enough and
you<00:05:19.850> want<00:05:19.970> it<00:05:20.090> to<00:05:20.180> start<00:05:20.390> to<00:05:20.450> produce<00:05:20.720> your<00:05:20.990> own

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:21.020 
you want it to start to produce your own

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:23.890 
you want it to start to produce your own
labels<00:05:21.680> then<00:05:22.190> in<00:05:22.400> fact<00:05:22.640> it<00:05:23.090> actually<00:05:23.120> sell<00:05:23.750> you

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:23.900 
labels then in fact it actually sell you

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:25.330 
labels then in fact it actually sell you
this<00:05:24.110> system<00:05:24.350> and<00:05:24.650> you<00:05:24.710> can<00:05:24.830> actually<00:05:25.190> produce

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:25.340 
this system and you can actually produce

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:27.910 
this system and you can actually produce
it<00:05:25.670> yourself<00:05:26.110> there's<00:05:27.110> there's<00:05:27.470> a<00:05:27.530> lot<00:05:27.590> more

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:27.920 
it yourself there's there's a lot more

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:29.560 
it yourself there's there's a lot more
to<00:05:28.100> it<00:05:28.130> than<00:05:28.370> just<00:05:28.430> a<00:05:28.730> printer<00:05:29.120> and<00:05:29.210> the<00:05:29.330> off

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:29.570 
to it than just a printer and the off

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:31.810 
to it than just a printer and the off
winder<00:05:30.440> and<00:05:30.590> so<00:05:30.770> forth<00:05:31.070> you<00:05:31.400> know<00:05:31.490> you'd<00:05:31.700> still

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:31.820 
winder and so forth you know you'd still

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:33.340 
winder and so forth you know you'd still
need<00:05:31.970> a<00:05:32.150> computer<00:05:32.540> powerful<00:05:33.170> enough<00:05:33.290> to

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:33.350 
need a computer powerful enough to

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:35.290 
need a computer powerful enough to
handle<00:05:33.590> a<00:05:33.800> label<00:05:34.160> formatting<00:05:34.640> software<00:05:35.120> and

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:35.300 
handle a label formatting software and

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:37.000 
handle a label formatting software and
then<00:05:35.720> you<00:05:35.810> know<00:05:35.960> also<00:05:36.260> have<00:05:36.560> to<00:05:36.680> be<00:05:36.770> able<00:05:36.860> to

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:37.010 
then you know also have to be able to

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:39.700 
then you know also have to be able to
set<00:05:37.760> up<00:05:37.790> for<00:05:38.000> graphics<00:05:38.480> and<00:05:38.630> so<00:05:38.780> forth<00:05:39.080> but

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:39.710 
set up for graphics and so forth but

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:42.040 
set up for graphics and so forth but
this<00:05:40.160> is<00:05:40.340> the<00:05:40.430> printer<00:05:40.760> once<00:05:41.450> again<00:05:41.750> if<00:05:41.960> you

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:42.050 
this is the printer once again if you

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:43.540 
this is the printer once again if you
change<00:05:42.320> it<00:05:42.470> to<00:05:42.560> anything<00:05:42.770> we<00:05:43.070> could<00:05:43.220> change<00:05:43.400> it

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:43.550 
change it to anything we could change it

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:45.480 
change it to anything we could change it
back<00:05:43.700> I'm<00:05:44.660> just<00:05:44.720> going<00:05:44.960> to<00:05:45.080> show<00:05:45.200> you

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:45.490 
back I'm just going to show you

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:51.540 
back I'm just going to show you
more<00:05:45.759> time<00:05:46.030> here<00:05:46.300> let's<00:05:46.960> just<00:05:47.020> call<00:05:47.380> it<00:05:50.550> cotton

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:51.550 
more time here let's just call it cotton

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:58.890 
more time here let's just call it cotton
soft<00:05:54.990> and<00:05:56.880> we'll<00:05:57.880> change<00:05:58.090> it<00:05:58.300> back<00:05:58.539> to<00:05:58.720> two

00:05:58.890 --> 00:05:58.900 
soft and we'll change it back to two

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:02.279 
soft and we'll change it back to two
ounces<00:05:59.610> and<00:06:00.610> I'm<00:06:01.210> only<00:06:01.360> making<00:06:01.569> this<00:06:01.900> video

00:06:02.279 --> 00:06:02.289 
ounces and I'm only making this video

00:06:02.289 --> 00:06:05.939 
ounces and I'm only making this video
for<00:06:03.220> you<00:06:03.310> to<00:06:03.340> see<00:06:03.639> so<00:06:04.050> and<00:06:05.050> we'll<00:06:05.380> come<00:06:05.590> up<00:06:05.620> here

00:06:05.939 --> 00:06:05.949 
for you to see so and we'll come up here

00:06:05.949 --> 00:06:08.689 
for you to see so and we'll come up here
and<00:06:06.039> we'll<00:06:06.160> do<00:06:06.280> our<00:06:06.430> file<00:06:06.780> print<00:06:07.780> and

00:06:08.689 --> 00:06:08.699 
and we'll do our file print and

00:06:08.699 --> 00:06:11.010 
and we'll do our file print and
hopefully<00:06:09.699> you<00:06:09.819> can<00:06:09.880> see<00:06:10.060> that<00:06:10.240> on<00:06:10.539> the<00:06:10.660> screen

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:11.020 
hopefully you can see that on the screen

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:13.080 
hopefully you can see that on the screen
in<00:06:11.380> fact<00:06:11.560> what<00:06:11.770> I'll<00:06:11.889> do<00:06:12.039> is<00:06:12.130> I'll<00:06:12.280> do<00:06:12.520> is<00:06:12.639> zoom

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:13.090 
in fact what I'll do is I'll do is zoom

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:14.550 
in fact what I'll do is I'll do is zoom
in<00:06:13.300> to<00:06:13.479> show<00:06:13.509> you<00:06:13.720> what<00:06:13.960> I<00:06:13.990> was<00:06:14.110> talking<00:06:14.500> about

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:14.560 
in to show you what I was talking about

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:21.540 
in to show you what I was talking about
on<00:06:14.860> the<00:06:14.889> screen<00:06:15.220> here<00:06:20.070> how<00:06:21.070> you<00:06:21.130> wouldn't<00:06:21.430> be

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:21.550 
on the screen here how you wouldn't be

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:22.830 
on the screen here how you wouldn't be
able<00:06:21.610> to<00:06:21.729> see<00:06:21.940> that<00:06:22.090> on<00:06:22.210> the<00:06:22.240> screen<00:06:22.389> good

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:22.840 
able to see that on the screen good

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:25.860 
able to see that on the screen good
thing<00:06:22.990> I'm<00:06:23.080> doing<00:06:23.289> a<00:06:23.349> zoom<00:06:23.530> in<00:06:23.680> I<00:06:24.780> think<00:06:25.780> you

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:25.870 
thing I'm doing a zoom in I think you

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:27.600 
thing I'm doing a zoom in I think you
can<00:06:26.050> see<00:06:26.229> it<00:06:26.320> now<00:06:26.500> where<00:06:26.800> I<00:06:26.979> actually<00:06:27.130> have<00:06:27.460> the

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:27.610 
can see it now where I actually have the

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:31.469 
can see it now where I actually have the
format<00:06:28.000> up<00:06:28.180> on<00:06:28.479> the<00:06:28.660> screen<00:06:28.930> itself<00:06:29.289> and<00:06:30.479> I'm

00:06:31.469 --> 00:06:31.479 
format up on the screen itself and I'm

00:06:31.479 --> 00:06:33.510 
format up on the screen itself and I'm
picking<00:06:31.780> the<00:06:31.870> quantity<00:06:32.470> and<00:06:32.710> then<00:06:33.130> once<00:06:33.340> I'm

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:33.520 
picking the quantity and then once I'm

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:35.159 
picking the quantity and then once I'm
done<00:06:33.550> with<00:06:33.699> the<00:06:33.880> quantity<00:06:34.180> I'll<00:06:34.270> just<00:06:34.539> hit

00:06:35.159 --> 00:06:35.169 
done with the quantity I'll just hit

00:06:35.169 --> 00:06:37.409 
done with the quantity I'll just hit
enter<00:06:35.440> with<00:06:35.740> the<00:06:35.919> mouse<00:06:36.430> I'm<00:06:36.849> gonna<00:06:37.030> zoom<00:06:37.270> in

00:06:37.409 --> 00:06:37.419 
enter with the mouse I'm gonna zoom in

00:06:37.419 --> 00:06:40.020 
enter with the mouse I'm gonna zoom in
on<00:06:37.599> the<00:06:37.919> printer<00:06:38.919> itself<00:06:39.039> so<00:06:39.880> you<00:06:39.970> can

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:40.030 
on the printer itself so you can

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:45.089 
on the printer itself so you can
actually<00:06:40.270> see<00:06:40.659> it<00:06:43.199> as<00:06:44.199> it<00:06:44.470> comes<00:06:44.650> out<00:06:44.800> and<00:06:44.860> so

00:06:45.089 --> 00:06:45.099 
actually see it as it comes out and so

00:06:45.099 --> 00:06:47.870 
actually see it as it comes out and so
forth

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:47.880 

00:06:47.880 --> 00:07:00.689 

pick<00:06:48.880> the<00:06:48.970> quantity<00:06:49.360> of<00:06:49.419> two<00:06:49.630> and<00:06:49.990> say<00:06:50.380> print

00:07:00.689 --> 00:07:00.699 

00:07:00.699 --> 00:07:03.670 

as<00:07:01.699> you<00:07:01.910> can<00:07:02.000> see<00:07:02.180> it<00:07:02.300> also<00:07:02.449> has<00:07:02.630> a<00:07:02.810> cutter<00:07:03.440> in

00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:03.680 
as you can see it also has a cutter in

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:05.770 
as you can see it also has a cutter in
it<00:07:03.800> with<00:07:03.979> a<00:07:04.009> catch<00:07:04.280> tray<00:07:04.639> hopefully<00:07:05.509> you<00:07:05.630> can

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:05.780 
it with a catch tray hopefully you can

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:10.540 
it with a catch tray hopefully you can
see<00:07:06.320> this<00:07:06.470> label<00:07:07.090> I'm<00:07:08.090> assuming<00:07:08.570> you<00:07:08.630> can<00:07:09.550> but

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:10.550 
see this label I'm assuming you can but

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:12.610 
see this label I'm assuming you can but
hopefully<00:07:10.850> you<00:07:10.940> can<00:07:11.000> see<00:07:11.120> this<00:07:11.419> this<00:07:12.199> label

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:12.620 
hopefully you can see this this label

00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:14.140 
hopefully you can see this this label
when<00:07:12.710> it<00:07:12.830> came<00:07:12.979> out<00:07:13.160> just<00:07:13.220> what<00:07:13.610> I<00:07:13.639> said<00:07:13.729> cotton

00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:14.150 
when it came out just what I said cotton

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:16.090 
when it came out just what I said cotton
soft<00:07:14.300> two<00:07:14.630> ounces<00:07:15.020> it's<00:07:15.470> easier<00:07:15.830> to<00:07:15.919> make<00:07:16.070> a

00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:16.100 
soft two ounces it's easier to make a

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:18.670 
soft two ounces it's easier to make a
change<00:07:16.430> like<00:07:16.669> that<00:07:16.910> than<00:07:17.150> anything<00:07:17.389> else<00:07:17.690> it

00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:18.680 
change like that than anything else it

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:20.350 
change like that than anything else it
doesn't<00:07:19.009> require<00:07:19.220> much<00:07:19.520> time<00:07:19.550> so<00:07:20.150> it's<00:07:20.300> really

00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:20.360 
doesn't require much time so it's really

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:22.150 
doesn't require much time so it's really
the<00:07:20.630> cost<00:07:20.870> that<00:07:21.050> the<00:07:21.110> Inc<00:07:21.350> costed<00:07:21.830> a<00:07:21.889> printer

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:22.160 
the cost that the Inc costed a printer

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:24.189 
the cost that the Inc costed a printer
actually<00:07:22.610> the<00:07:22.850> cost<00:07:23.060> of<00:07:23.210> the<00:07:23.270> label<00:07:23.539> period<00:07:23.780> so

00:07:24.189 --> 00:07:24.199 
actually the cost of the label period so

00:07:24.199 --> 00:07:26.050 
actually the cost of the label period so
and<00:07:24.710> that<00:07:24.860> I<00:07:24.889> haven't<00:07:25.310> even<00:07:25.400> determined<00:07:25.970> yet

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:26.060 
and that I haven't even determined yet

00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:27.249 
and that I haven't even determined yet
but<00:07:26.210> I<00:07:26.240> think<00:07:26.449> I<00:07:26.509> gave<00:07:26.690> you<00:07:26.780> an<00:07:26.870> approximate

00:07:27.249 --> 00:07:27.259 
but I think I gave you an approximate

00:07:27.259 --> 00:07:29.200 
but I think I gave you an approximate
cost<00:07:27.560> but<00:07:27.860> that's<00:07:28.759> it

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:29.210 
cost but that's it

00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:30.879 
cost but that's it
hopefully<00:07:29.780> that<00:07:29.930> I'll<00:07:30.050> answer<00:07:30.169> any<00:07:30.470> questions

00:07:30.879 --> 00:07:30.889 
hopefully that I'll answer any questions

00:07:30.889 --> 00:07:32.469 
hopefully that I'll answer any questions
and<00:07:31.039> so<00:07:31.190> forth<00:07:31.490> but<00:07:31.550> that's<00:07:31.789> basically<00:07:32.060> what

00:07:32.469 --> 00:07:32.479 
and so forth but that's basically what

00:07:32.479 --> 00:07:34.810 
and so forth but that's basically what
your<00:07:32.660> labels<00:07:32.930> going<00:07:33.139> to<00:07:33.199> look<00:07:33.349> like<00:07:33.729> you<00:07:34.729> know

00:07:34.810 --> 00:07:34.820 
your labels going to look like you know
