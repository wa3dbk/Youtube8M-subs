00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
half an hour to 40 minutes so this is

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:47.830 
half an hour to 40 minutes so this is
perfect<00:02:46.010> timing<00:02:46.190> you<00:02:47.000> can<00:02:47.150> say<00:02:47.360> probably<00:02:47.660> away

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 
perfect timing you can say probably away

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.970 
perfect timing you can say probably away
for<00:02:48.050> a<00:02:48.110> bit<00:02:50.110> so<00:02:51.110> here's<00:02:51.350> how<00:02:51.500> it<00:02:51.620> looks<00:02:51.860> when

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
for a bit so here's how it looks when

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.190 
for a bit so here's how it looks when
it's<00:02:52.130> finished<00:02:52.400> it's<00:02:53.270> thickened<00:02:53.660> a<00:02:53.720> bit<00:02:53.870> I

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
it's finished it's thickened a bit I

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.650 
it's finished it's thickened a bit I
usually<00:02:55.010> serve<00:02:55.220> it<00:02:55.370> with<00:02:55.490> some<00:02:55.630> crusty<00:02:56.630> bread
