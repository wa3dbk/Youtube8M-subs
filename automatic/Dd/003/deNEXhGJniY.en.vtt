wanted<00:00:24.230> to<00:00:24.289> keep<00:00:24.409> it<00:00:24.560> up<00:00:24.710> and<00:00:24.949> make<00:00:25.400> sure<00:00:25.429> that

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:38.979 
probably yeah yeah that was a thing as
things<00:00:37.250> were<00:00:37.370> just<00:00:37.399> falling<00:00:37.699> for<00:00:38.030> me<00:00:38.149> I<00:00:38.329> don't

were good to me today uh you know I
think<00:00:49.460> it's<00:00:49.550> cuz<00:00:49.699> they<00:00:50.329> when<00:00:50.960> they<00:00:51.050> were

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:51.140 
think it's cuz they when they were

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:52.989 
think it's cuz they when they were
watching<00:00:51.410> film<00:00:51.589> they<00:00:51.710> saw<00:00:51.890> that<00:00:51.940> you<00:00:52.940> know

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:52.999 
watching film they saw that you know

00:00:52.999 --> 00:00:54.669 
watching film they saw that you know
when<00:00:53.210> they<00:00:53.329> start<00:00:53.390> doubling<00:00:53.899> we<00:00:54.440> have<00:00:54.530> such

00:00:54.669 --> 00:00:54.679 
when they start doubling we have such

00:00:54.679 --> 00:00:56.169 
when they start doubling we have such
dangerous<00:00:55.010> shooters<00:00:55.339> on<00:00:55.429> the<00:00:55.460> outside<00:00:55.850> that

00:00:56.169 --> 00:00:56.179 
dangerous shooters on the outside that

00:00:56.179 --> 00:00:58.239 
dangerous shooters on the outside that
you<00:00:57.140> know<00:00:57.260> we<00:00:57.440> kick<00:00:57.620> it<00:00:57.739> out<00:00:57.859> and<00:00:57.980> we<00:00:58.039> get<00:00:58.160> it

00:00:58.239 --> 00:00:58.249 
you know we kick it out and we get it

00:00:58.249 --> 00:01:00.369 
you know we kick it out and we get it
three<00:00:58.460> instead<00:00:58.789> of<00:00:58.850> you<00:00:59.179> know<00:00:59.289> you<00:01:00.289> know

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:00.379 
three instead of you know you know

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:03.849 
three instead of you know you know
possible<00:01:00.829> to<00:01:01.010> so<00:01:01.429> I<00:01:01.730> think<00:01:02.329> that<00:01:02.739> you<00:01:03.739> know

00:01:03.849 --> 00:01:03.859

that<00:01:04.430> really<00:01:04.580> influenced<00:01:05.120> them<00:01:05.239> on<00:01:05.600> how

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:05.750 
that really influenced them on how

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:07.420 
that really influenced them on how
they're<00:01:05.870> going<00:01:06.050> to<00:01:06.110> guard<00:01:06.320> and<00:01:06.740> you<00:01:07.220> know<00:01:07.310> when

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:07.430 
they're going to guard and you know when

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:09.580

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:09.590 
they did did double team in a few times

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:12.460 
they did did double team in a few times
it<00:01:09.950> was<00:01:10.070> big<00:01:10.310> big<00:01:10.520> and<00:01:11.110> you<00:01:12.110> know<00:01:12.230> I<00:01:12.260> was<00:01:12.440> just

you know we don't do if we if we lose it

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:40.510 
you know we don't do if we if we lose it
should<00:01:38.360> be<00:01:38.450> a<00:01:38.479> dogfight<00:01:38.750> and<00:01:39.340> you<00:01:40.340> know<00:01:40.460> I

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:03.370 
yeah um well I mean we're playing the
pit<00:04:01.280> it's<00:04:02.090> it's<00:04:02.480> tough<00:04:02.690> to<00:04:02.840> breathe<00:04:03.020> out<00:04:03.230> there

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:03.380 
pit it's it's tough to breathe out there

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:05.710 
pit it's it's tough to breathe out there
and<00:04:03.530> when<00:04:03.650> you're<00:04:03.740> not<00:04:04.060> making<00:04:05.060> baskets<00:04:05.240> it

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:08.830 
and when you're not making baskets it
gets<00:04:06.050> even<00:04:06.380> more<00:04:06.500> frustrating<00:04:07.220> so<00:04:07.750> you<00:04:08.750> know

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:08.840 
gets even more frustrating so you know

gets even more frustrating so you know
we<00:04:08.960> could<00:04:09.080> see<00:04:09.230> them<00:04:09.290> kind<00:04:09.470> of<00:04:09.620> dying<00:04:09.830> at<00:04:10.040> the

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:10.160 
we could see them kind of dying at the

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:13.810 
we could see them kind of dying at the
very<00:04:10.370> end<00:04:10.550> I<00:04:11.950> think<00:04:12.950> they<00:04:13.280> took<00:04:13.430> us<00:04:13.580> a<00:04:13.610> little

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:38.820 
thought we were better than we were and

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:42.149 
thought we were better than we were and
losing<00:06:39.820> two<00:06:40.599> quick<00:06:40.840> ones<00:06:41.050> was<00:06:41.320> really

00:06:42.149 --> 00:06:42.159 
losing two quick ones was really

00:06:42.159 --> 00:06:46.499 
losing two quick ones was really
humbling<00:06:42.490> so<00:06:44.460> it<00:06:45.460> made<00:06:45.639> us<00:06:45.789> work<00:06:46.000> harder<00:06:46.360> and

advantage on him just simply from you
know<00:07:31.049> the<00:07:31.079> crowd<00:07:31.469> and<00:07:31.829> being<00:07:32.459> it<00:07:32.579> in<00:07:32.669> the<00:07:32.759> pit

00:07:32.959 --> 00:07:32.969 
know the crowd and being it in the pit

know the crowd and being it in the pit
so<00:07:34.339> you<00:07:35.339> know<00:07:35.459> we're<00:07:35.609> confident<00:07:36.029> going<00:07:36.149> into

00:07:36.409 --> 00:07:36.419 
so you know we're confident going into

00:07:36.419 --> 00:07:37.849 
so you know we're confident going into
the<00:07:36.539> game<00:07:36.689> even<00:07:37.049> though<00:07:37.139> we<00:07:37.289> had<00:07:37.379> lost<00:07:37.589> last

00:07:37.849 --> 00:07:37.859 
the game even though we had lost last

00:07:37.859 --> 00:07:41.029 
the game even though we had lost last
time<00:07:38.129> but<00:07:38.399> I<00:07:39.119> think<00:07:39.869> that<00:07:40.049> was<00:07:40.169> a<00:07:40.199> huge<00:07:40.799> factor

00:07:41.029 --> 00:07:41.039 
time but I think that was a huge factor

00:07:41.039 --> 00:07:43.369 
time but I think that was a huge factor
especially<00:07:41.429> because<00:07:41.939> at<00:07:42.659> some<00:07:42.929> points<00:07:43.259> we

00:07:43.369 --> 00:07:43.379 
especially because at some points we

00:07:43.379 --> 00:07:44.719 
especially because at some points we
couldn't<00:07:43.649> hear<00:07:43.769> ourselves<00:07:43.829> think<00:07:44.129> during<00:07:44.549> the

00:07:44.719 --> 00:07:44.729 
couldn't hear ourselves think during the

00:07:44.729 --> 00:07:54.420 
couldn't hear ourselves think during the
games<00:07:44.939> I<00:07:45.509> helped<00:07:46.259> us<00:07:46.349> out

00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:54.430 

00:07:54.430 --> 00:07:56.490
