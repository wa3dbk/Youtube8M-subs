pizzazz<00:00:58.649> I<00:00:58.980> guess<00:00:59.160> to<00:00:59.670> the<00:00:59.789> armors<00:01:00.149> that<00:01:00.359> way

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
pizzazz I guess to the armors that way

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.009 
pizzazz I guess to the armors that way
everyone<00:01:01.079> feels<00:01:01.379> a<00:01:01.559> little<00:01:01.710> bit<00:01:01.920> more<00:01:02.250> unique
