00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.090
 Well, not listening to the table car classes 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:37.800
 kept the Arabs bid 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.810
 at closing 

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:41.730
 on exactly how will develop in April 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.660
 brother to the housing payment system for just 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:45.970

 flew on emergency dangerous at the post 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:50.160
 our world they did not hide that 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.810
 turned a blind eye because 

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:54.490
 because it is not profitable because 

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:56.350
 do not want to pay extra money 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:58.740
 but how and what flies from Yaroslavl 

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:00.110
 presidential disasters 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:01.039
 catching up 

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:03.140
 growth times supervision checks

 day and night under special attention 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.100
 aircraft yak 42 small air carriers 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.670
 similar most acute problems for 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.890
 small companies small company 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.270
 has several different types 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.230
 aircraft and track 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:19.880
 how is it possible they canâ€™t do 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.630
 in full almost before 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.540
 each departure of such an aircraft of his 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.190
 literally and still pulse predilections crew 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:27.900
 certainly not on my own but with understanding 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.340
 refer to such emergency measures from 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:32.330
 situations extremely 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.330
 although the track is maintained 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:43.950
 but 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.320
 missing security council 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:46.370
 because 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:48.660
 but her little airline happens 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:50.790
 order and everything is fine 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.690
 most colleagues company problem 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:54.730
 happens and sports as well as definitely 

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:56.060
 can't talk 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.810
 I could not sell and all the problems 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:00.840
 in the human factor is more practical 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.159
 those who are in the air and those who are violent 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:05.720
 sure major general retired vladimir 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:06.590
 ponomarenko 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.259
 says the trouble is that looking back today 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:11.440
 non-aviators are managed by managers 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:12.150
 caroline 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.759
 according to steel agencies 

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:15.279
 Board of Directors 

00:02:15.279 --> 00:02:18.659
 there does not go beyond the flight or the daughter 

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:21.199
 among the first she does not go doctor 

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.989
 will not be 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:24.649
 and I owe the numbers to labor 

00:02:24.649 --> 00:02:27.089
 go there throwing set 

00:02:27.089 --> 00:02:28.989
 kairat your talent 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:30.749
 Tsonga none of them is 

00:02:30.749 --> 00:02:32.139
 a professional 

00:02:32.139 --> 00:02:33.939
 just a few days of strong checks 

00:02:33.939 --> 00:02:36.609
 rustrans supervision and ban on departure and already 

00:02:36.609 --> 00:02:39.219
 got eight yak 42 planes 

00:02:39.219 --> 00:02:41.659
 four small and air carriers 

00:02:41.659 --> 00:02:44.109
 and it seems that very soon themselves 

00:02:44.109 --> 00:02:47.109
 airlines in Russia are so significant 

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:49.569
 All this can complicate Sergei
