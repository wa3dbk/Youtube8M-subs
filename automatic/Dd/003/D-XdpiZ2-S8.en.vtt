purchase from the Dollar Tree you really
need<00:00:16.330> to<00:00:16.539> grind<00:00:16.810> them<00:00:17.200> up<00:00:17.350> in<00:00:17.770> order<00:00:18.039> to<00:00:18.220> get

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:18.520 
need to grind them up in order to get

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:20.240 
need to grind them up in order to get
the<00:00:18.730> benefits<00:00:19.270> from<00:00:19.480> them<00:00:19.690> they're<00:00:19.900> high<00:00:20.170> in

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
the benefits from them they're high in

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.750 
the benefits from them they're high in
omega-3<00:00:21.250> but<00:00:22.060> it<00:00:22.990> has<00:00:23.230> a<00:00:23.260> hard<00:00:23.770> coating<00:00:24.310> on<00:00:24.520> the

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:24.760 
omega-3 but it has a hard coating on the

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:28.020 
omega-3 but it has a hard coating on the
seed<00:00:25.030> and<00:00:25.450> you<00:00:26.260> will<00:00:26.500> not<00:00:26.650> get<00:00:26.980> that<00:00:27.030> omega-3

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:28.030 
seed and you will not get that omega-3

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:31.410 
seed and you will not get that omega-3
if<00:00:28.240> you<00:00:28.360> don't<00:00:28.570> grind<00:00:29.050> up<00:00:29.440> the<00:00:29.860> seeds<00:00:30.060> so<00:00:31.060> I

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:31.420 
if you don't grind up the seeds so I

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:33.540 
if you don't grind up the seeds so I
knew<00:00:31.930> I<00:00:31.960> needed<00:00:32.230> to<00:00:32.559> have<00:00:32.800> some<00:00:33.070> kind<00:00:33.280> of<00:00:33.340> way

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:33.550

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:37.620 
knew I needed to have some kind of way
to<00:00:33.579> grind<00:00:34.090> the<00:00:34.930> seeds<00:00:35.340> so<00:00:36.340> I<00:00:36.370> already<00:00:37.360> have

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:37.630

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 
you can see that it's ground up so

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:02.709 
you can see that it's ground up so
nicely<00:02:58.879> and<00:02:59.540> it's<00:03:00.409> not<00:03:00.650> like<00:03:00.920> completely<00:03:01.719> so

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:02.719
