00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600 
now here's no spin away and then he's

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:39.940 
now here's no spin away and then he's
going<00:01:38.750> to<00:01:38.810> use<00:01:38.960> his<00:01:38.990> two<00:01:39.320> steps<00:01:39.620> down<00:01:39.710> this

00:03:36.059 --> 00:03:36.069 
straight I'm just going to just hold the

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:37.619 
straight I'm just going to just hold the
straight<00:03:36.340> Falls<00:03:36.609> doing<00:03:36.879> everything<00:03:37.150> it's

00:03:37.619 --> 00:03:37.629 
straight Falls doing everything it's

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:40.319 
straight Falls doing everything it's
very<00:03:37.750> similar<00:03:38.139> to<00:03:38.290> the<00:03:38.739> whole<00:03:39.430> philosophy<00:03:39.579> and

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:40.329 
very similar to the whole philosophy and

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:42.990 
very similar to the whole philosophy and
theory<00:03:40.720> of<00:03:40.870> of<00:03:41.349> when<00:03:42.310> you<00:03:42.400> get<00:03:42.519> split<00:03:42.790> up<00:03:42.879> to

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000 
theory of of when you get split up to

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.819 
theory of of when you get split up to
the<00:03:43.090> basket<00:03:43.209> so<00:03:43.690> if<00:03:43.989> I<00:03:44.139> get<00:03:44.319> squared<00:03:44.560> up<00:03:44.620> to<00:03:44.739> the

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:44.829 
the basket so if I get squared up to the

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:46.860 
the basket so if I get squared up to the
basket<00:03:45.010> or<00:03:45.669> if<00:03:45.819> I<00:03:45.879> jump<00:03:46.180> get<00:03:46.329> split<00:03:46.569> up<00:03:46.690> the

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870 
basket or if I jump get split up the

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:49.439 
basket or if I jump get split up the
back<00:03:47.019> I'm<00:03:47.650> right<00:03:47.919> here<00:03:48.190> and<00:03:48.760> I<00:03:48.849> go<00:03:49.000> to<00:03:49.060> shoot
