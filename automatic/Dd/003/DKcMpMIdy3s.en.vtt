 chili and oil we discover with magic 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:23.670

 potatoes we discover with magic cooker e 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:46.840
 let's start 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.840
 five minutes of live flame 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:55.250
 five minutes gone 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:02:02.120
 then we find out we turn over 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:04.240
 the pasta the tomato and the water of 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:04.240

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:13.610
 add a pinch of pepper 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:16.400
 we end up covering everything with magic 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:19.220
 hoover and wait a minute for that 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:23.900
 resume the value we start the 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:26.660

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:40.580
 leave seven minutes then 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:43.519
