00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:24.870 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:30.360 

then<00:01:25.870> before<00:01:26.290> we<00:01:27.540> actually<00:01:28.540> go<00:01:28.780> out<00:01:28.810> there<00:01:29.370> we

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:30.370 
then before we actually go out there we

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:35.070 
then before we actually go out there we
have<00:01:30.520> to<00:01:30.640> do<00:01:30.790> some<00:01:31.090> month<00:01:33.450> we<00:01:34.450> have<00:01:34.570> to<00:01:34.690> do<00:01:34.810> some

have to do some month we have to do some
some<00:01:35.800> seeding<00:01:36.250> field<00:01:39.000> might<00:01:40.000> be<00:01:40.150> a<00:01:40.180> little<00:01:40.390> bit

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:40.630 
some seeding field might be a little bit

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:42.240 
some seeding field might be a little bit
give<00:01:41.260> it<00:01:41.410> plenty<00:01:41.530> of<00:01:41.710> time<00:01:41.770> for<00:01:42.100> this<00:01:42.190> to

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:42.250 
give it plenty of time for this to

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:42.930 
give it plenty of time for this to
charge

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:42.940 
charge

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:47.310 
charge
I<00:01:44.790> probably<00:01:45.790> shouldn't<00:01:46.180> Park<00:01:46.420> in<00:01:46.540> trouble<00:01:46.900> or

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:47.320 
I probably shouldn't Park in trouble or

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:53.500 
I probably shouldn't Park in trouble or
we're<00:01:47.530> gonna<00:01:47.620> need<00:01:47.890> that

the heck of it I've thrown some tires in
the<00:02:29.750> back<00:02:29.840> here<00:02:30.230> that<00:02:30.349> we're<00:02:30.469> in<00:02:30.530> the<00:02:30.620> front<00:02:30.859> I

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
the back here that we're in the front I

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.280 
the back here that we're in the front I
slid<00:02:31.220> them<00:02:31.310> back<00:02:32.049> hopefully<00:02:33.049> you<00:02:33.109> get<00:02:33.230> a

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
slid them back hopefully you get a

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:37.089 
slid them back hopefully you get a

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
the front tire a little bit probably

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.319 
the front tire a little bit probably
won't<00:02:41.629> go<00:02:41.780> anywhere<00:02:42.200> but<00:02:43.030> we'll<00:02:44.030> give<00:02:44.150> it<00:02:44.239> a

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:44.329

so you know a lot of guys suggested
jacking<00:05:30.099> it<00:05:30.190> up<00:05:30.340> but<00:05:30.610> it<00:05:31.330> was<00:05:31.449> so<00:05:31.630> buried<00:05:31.960> I

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:32.050 
jacking it up but it was so buried I

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:34.770 
jacking it up but it was so buried I
would<00:05:32.199> have<00:05:32.289> had<00:05:32.380> to<00:05:32.500> dig<00:05:33.270> what<00:05:34.270> I<00:05:34.300> had<00:05:34.449> to<00:05:34.569> dig

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:34.780 
would have had to dig what I had to dig

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:36.390 
would have had to dig what I had to dig
basically<00:05:35.349> a<00:05:35.380> trench<00:05:35.740> down<00:05:35.919> there<00:05:36.160> to<00:05:36.250> get<00:05:36.340> a

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:36.400 
basically a trench down there to get a

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:40.230 
basically a trench down there to get a
jack<00:05:36.699> under<00:05:36.910> it<00:05:37.120> and<00:05:37.410> I<00:05:38.729> don't<00:05:39.729> think<00:05:39.880> I<00:05:40.090> would

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:40.240 
jack under it and I don't think I would

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:44.490 
jack under it and I don't think I would
trust<00:05:40.750> this<00:05:40.960> bumper<00:05:42.210> to<00:05:43.210> jack<00:05:43.930> up<00:05:43.960> on<00:05:44.319> or

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:44.500 
trust this bumper to jack up on or

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:46.409 
trust this bumper to jack up on or
anything<00:05:44.710> so<00:05:45.130> it<00:05:45.880> would<00:05:46.000> have<00:05:46.120> had<00:05:46.210> to<00:05:46.300> go

00:05:46.409 --> 00:05:46.419 
anything so it would have had to go

00:05:46.419 --> 00:05:48.899 
anything so it would have had to go
under<00:05:46.630> the<00:05:46.720> frame<00:05:46.990> and<00:05:47.340> that<00:05:48.340> was<00:05:48.490> pretty<00:05:48.699> well

00:05:48.899 --> 00:05:48.909 
under the frame and that was pretty well

00:05:48.909 --> 00:05:51.570 
under the frame and that was pretty well
buried<00:05:50.159> but<00:05:51.159> yeah

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:51.580 
buried but yeah

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:53.460 
buried but yeah
