well now the cyclists are all optional

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:09.060 
well now the cyclists are all optional
but<00:06:07.780> this<00:06:07.900> game<00:06:08.110> gives<00:06:08.410> you<00:06:08.590> a<00:06:08.620> really<00:06:08.919> big

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:09.070 
but this game gives you a really big

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:11.400 
but this game gives you a really big
incentive<00:06:09.729> to<00:06:09.850> actually<00:06:09.880> do<00:06:10.419> them<00:06:10.630> there<00:06:11.260> is<00:06:11.380> a

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:11.410 
incentive to actually do them there is a

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:13.020 
incentive to actually do them there is a
lot<00:06:11.620> more<00:06:11.650> I<00:06:11.830> could<00:06:12.070> talk<00:06:12.220> about<00:06:12.370> but<00:06:12.640> I<00:06:12.669> really

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:13.030 
lot more I could talk about but I really

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:14.310 
lot more I could talk about but I really
think<00:06:13.180> it's<00:06:13.360> better<00:06:13.540> that<00:06:13.660> you<00:06:13.810> actually<00:06:14.050> play

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:14.320 
think it's better that you actually play

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:15.480 
think it's better that you actually play
the<00:06:14.470> game<00:06:14.590> for<00:06:14.620> yourself<00:06:15.070> instead<00:06:15.340> of

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:15.490 
the game for yourself instead of

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:17.430 
the game for yourself instead of
listening<00:06:15.640> to<00:06:15.880> me<00:06:16.060> talk<00:06:16.270> about<00:06:16.330> it<00:06:16.690> so<00:06:17.260> what<00:06:17.410> I

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:17.440 
listening to me talk about it so what I

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:20.159 
listening to me talk about it so what I
recommend<00:06:17.500> it<00:06:17.950> well<00:06:18.310> gear<00:06:18.640> totally<00:06:19.270> it's<00:06:19.990> not

00:06:20.159 --> 00:06:20.169

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:23.830 
to the redundancy and the easiness of

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:25.890 
to the redundancy and the easiness of
the<00:06:23.950> combat<00:06:24.280> system<00:06:24.490> but<00:06:25.240> if<00:06:25.360> you<00:06:25.479> like<00:06:25.630> that
