00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
this so what we'll do is we can either

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.880 
this so what we'll do is we can either
blot<00:00:45.530> the<00:00:47.000> peroxide<00:00:48.000> on<00:00:48.180> or<00:00:48.390> in<00:00:48.480> this<00:00:48.660> case<00:00:48.960> you

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
blot the peroxide on or in this case you

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.350 
blot the peroxide on or in this case you
know<00:00:50.010> pour<00:00:50.280> a<00:00:50.309> little<00:00:50.460> bit<00:00:50.610> in<00:00:50.730> your<00:00:50.760> cap<00:00:51.120> so

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
know pour a little bit in your cap so

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.119 
know pour a little bit in your cap so

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
you can control it and you can actually

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:59.420 
you can control it and you can actually
pour<00:00:53.550> it<00:00:53.670> right<00:00:53.789> over<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:54.210> stain<00:00:58.190> and<00:00:59.190> you

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
pour it right over the stain and you

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:00.709 
pour it right over the stain and you
might<00:00:59.550> want<00:00:59.699> to<00:00:59.730> let<00:00:59.820> that<00:00:59.879> set<00:01:00.300> a<00:01:00.329> little<00:01:00.570> bit

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
might want to let that set a little bit

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.270 
might want to let that set a little bit
and<00:01:00.960> then<00:01:01.109> go<00:01:01.260> back<00:01:01.440> to<00:01:01.469> blotting<00:01:01.980> it's<00:01:02.100> very

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
and then go back to blotting it's very

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.560 
and then go back to blotting it's very

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
not working the next thing we can go to

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.640 
not working the next thing we can go to
is<00:01:20.220> make<00:01:20.970> a<00:01:21.000> solution<00:01:21.390> of<00:01:21.720> baking<00:01:21.869> soda<00:01:22.320> and

is make a solution of baking soda and
and<00:01:23.180> water<00:01:24.180> here<00:01:25.049> and<00:01:26.869> then<00:01:27.869> again<00:01:28.020> you<00:01:28.409> can

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
and water here and then again you can

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.170 
and water here and then again you can
either<00:01:28.710> dab<00:01:28.979> this<00:01:29.220> on<00:01:29.430> or<00:01:29.700> you<00:01:29.790> can<00:01:29.909> pour<00:01:30.150> a

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
either dab this on or you can pour a

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.179 
either dab this on or you can pour a
little<00:01:30.329> bit<00:01:30.450> on<00:01:30.770> but<00:01:31.770> we<00:01:31.829> want<00:01:32.009> to<00:01:32.070> keep

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
little bit on but we want to keep

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.730 
little bit on but we want to keep
working<00:01:32.430> this<00:01:32.790> now<00:01:33.689> if<00:01:33.810> you<00:01:33.900> don't<00:01:34.079> have<00:01:34.320> good

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
working this now if you don't have good

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.920 
working this now if you don't have good
results<00:01:35.250> with<00:01:35.400> either<00:01:35.520> the<00:01:35.729> peroxide<00:01:36.390> or<00:01:36.780> the

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
results with either the peroxide or the

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.499 
results with either the peroxide or the
baking<00:01:37.259> soda<00:01:37.470> solution<00:01:38.150> then<00:01:39.150> you<00:01:39.270> can<00:01:39.360> go<00:01:39.479> to

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
baking soda solution then you can go to

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.859 
baking soda solution then you can go to
some<00:01:39.810> over-the-counter<00:01:40.380> products<00:01:41.119> such<00:01:42.119> as<00:01:42.150> a

stain remover or a goof-off or something
like<00:01:45.840> that<00:01:46.170> now<00:01:46.920> it's<00:01:47.130> very<00:01:47.340> important<00:01:47.909> if<00:01:48.030> you

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
like that now it's very important if you

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.270 
like that now it's very important if you
move<00:01:48.390> up<00:01:48.630> to<00:01:48.810> a<00:01:48.840> stronger<00:01:49.380> chemical<00:01:49.860> such<00:01:50.100> as

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
move up to a stronger chemical such as

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.280 
move up to a stronger chemical such as
this<00:01:50.520> to<00:01:50.729> remove<00:01:51.000> the<00:01:51.180> stain<00:01:51.420> you'll<00:01:52.079> want<00:01:52.259> to

in<00:01:54.210> a<00:01:54.869> closet<00:01:55.320> area<00:01:55.860> so<00:01:56.430> to<00:01:56.880> make<00:01:57.119> sure<00:01:57.270> that<00:01:57.450> it

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
in a closet area so to make sure that it

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.359 
in a closet area so to make sure that it
does<00:01:57.780> not<00:01:57.960> remove<00:01:58.380> the<00:01:58.710> color<00:01:58.920> out<00:01:59.189> of<00:01:59.219> the

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
does not remove the color out of the

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:00.620 
does not remove the color out of the
carpet<00:01:59.850> so<00:01:59.969> you<00:02:00.000> want<00:02:00.180> to<00:02:00.240> make<00:02:00.360> sure<00:02:00.390> your

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
carpet so you want to make sure your

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.109 
carpet so you want to make sure your
carpet<00:02:00.960> is<00:02:01.079> colorfast<00:02:01.670> so<00:02:02.670> if<00:02:02.790> we<00:02:02.909> use<00:02:03.090> that

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
carpet is colorfast so if we use that

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:04.819 
carpet is colorfast so if we use that
and<00:02:03.540> that<00:02:03.630> doesn't<00:02:03.810> quite<00:02:04.079> work<00:02:04.140> then<00:02:04.710> we<00:02:04.799> can

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
and that doesn't quite work then we can

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:06.920 
and that doesn't quite work then we can
also<00:02:05.100> go<00:02:05.460> up<00:02:05.640> to<00:02:05.670> the<00:02:05.909> strongest<00:02:06.479> which<00:02:06.750> would

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
also go up to the strongest which would

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.630 
also go up to the strongest which would
be<00:02:07.079> a<00:02:07.110> non<00:02:07.409> acetone<00:02:07.970> polish<00:02:08.970> remover<00:02:09.979> and<00:02:10.979> on

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
be a non acetone polish remover and on

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.369 
be a non acetone polish remover and on
this<00:02:11.790> one<00:02:12.030> what<00:02:12.209> I'd<00:02:12.300> recommend<00:02:12.510> on<00:02:12.930> this<00:02:13.110> one
