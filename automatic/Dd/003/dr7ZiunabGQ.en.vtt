 returning and returning first with 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:22.230
 a tutorial a tutorial basically 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:24.330
 base for those who follow minecraft above all 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.039
 for those who play minecraft for those who 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.660
 follows 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.789
 in fact this tutorial is for like 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:34.770
 download minecraft as you know 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:38.160
 minecraft has been updated and updated 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:41.190
 a lot and we arrived at the non-version 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:46.350
 I want to be wrong now 4 January 2014 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:48.000
 to version 1.4 a bit 7.4 I don't want 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.489
 make a mistake 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.780
 I certainly want to check to be 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.980
 sure 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:59.730
 oh God came out even for ps4 I didn't know 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:03.390
 that we have at least discovered one 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:05.010
 new thing is 1.1.7 point 4 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.689
 then how to get the new one 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.659
 launch because a lot of the launch does not 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:11.189
 they work then first of all indeed 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.380
 first of all the only thing we need 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:16.229
 do is download this archive that 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:19.439
 I'll put linking description to a site you 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:21.630
 called mega has recently been made but is 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:24.500
 really very very fast once 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:28.530
 downloaded rate text extracts here 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:31.290
 we extract there we have this folder in 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:34.020
 reality is lancer is not really minecraft 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.150
 there is the game and minecraft the launcher has 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.759
 a different name 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:40.290
 in fact when we open this 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.540
 launcher if we have the folder 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.259
 obviously we choose the system 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.630
 operating 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:51.290
 let's change this case I have windows 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:54.750
 as you can well see and we have this 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:58.170
 kinect launcher us to start 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.909
 minecraft double click normally 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.530
 or we follow him as an administrator 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:04.770
 the same sincerely 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:07.560
 performed normal and nothing happened 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:10.440
 we will have this screen sincerely 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.760
 I would have so we have this screen 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.510
 you obviously don't have this 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.989
 only user 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:17.040
 choose loser name and login one 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:19.860
 once logged in 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.659
 when you re-open the second time you have 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:24.659
 exactly this screen of course 

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:26.159
 with your name then play for the 

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:28.560
 second time 

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:30.120
 once done here when we are 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.989
 arrived in this screen we must 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:38.549
 press play of course to me and immediately has 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:42.629
 loaded to you it will take us about me 

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:46.109
 it seems that a month has put around 55 six 

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:47.670
 minutes or so to ask or 

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:48.900
 install all the files and so on 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:52.040
 etc. etc. 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.040
 once the files are installed 

00:02:52.139 --> 00:02:56.370
 I recommend 56 minutes so you don't 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:57.750
 worry if even at some point 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:59.250
 however it takes time 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:02.250
 it also depends on the speed of yours 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:03.810
 computer I don't know if it also depends on 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:07.379
 connection sincerely this is not it 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:09.989
 I know once this is done the folder 

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:12.690
 minecraft if you are obviously going to look 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:16.650
 the folder even if you have to do 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:20.489
 you have to put a shape just one 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:22.680
 map on minecraft a part of 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:25.019
 minecraft is like old temple is one 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:28.129
 percent roaming for one hundred percent 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:35.639
 minecraft point which we have all the 

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:38.250
 all the minecraft folder is 

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:40.169
 nothing so once done this for 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:42.660
 reopen minecraft just double up 

00:03:40.169 --> 00:03:45.090
 click on that launch and and I recommend you 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:48.030
 bring the launcher here in fact I have it 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:49.829
 brought here create a link and in 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:52.519
 such a way so you can also put 

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:55.290
 the minecraft icon then to render 

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:57.000
 the most expensive game is the game for 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:00.030
 make the icon prettier as your own 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.799
 as if you had minecraft bought then 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:04.560
 once this is done for the second 

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:07.530
 can fuck it once can do play 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:10.379
 once done play and it will open 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:13.199
 minecraft single player that 

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:15.419
 question to map that I have a map 

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:17.489
 he knew where I was trying fairies in the new 

00:04:15.419 --> 00:04:19.530
 world creating world now the race one 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:22.229
 bit because I'm recording now after 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:25.430
 I will hunt but I can assure you that the 

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:25.430
 game works great 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:30.780
 ok perfect as you can see or moreover 

00:04:29.099 --> 00:04:32.280
 you can set the Italian language here 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:34.440
 it is practically the same as the original 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:37.320
 which to the old versions of minecraft 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:39.150
 everything works properly 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:39.690
 so guys this tutorial ends 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:42.930
 here 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:44.729
 I hope it was helpful because with 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:46.680
 the old lancer now minecraft not 

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:48.360
 more so if the video is there 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.990

 you haven't done it yet because soon 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:05:00.150
 in fact we should also register a 

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:04.400
 map or park maps are already 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:06.719
 prepared and then two spoilers and then 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:08.370
 we will try to register them as much as possible 

00:05:06.719 --> 00:05:12.539
 so as to load more videos 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:15.180
 therefore to return from returning active 

00:05:12.539 --> 00:05:17.190
