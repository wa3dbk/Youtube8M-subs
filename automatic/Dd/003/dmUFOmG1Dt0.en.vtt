Boeing<00:00:21.190> triple7

00:00:21.929 --> 00:00:21.939 
Boeing triple7

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:27.739 
Boeing triple7
300<00:00:22.539> from<00:00:22.929> cold<00:00:23.320> and<00:00:23.589> dark<00:00:23.830> one<00:00:24.660> so<00:00:26.519> first

00:00:27.739 --> 00:00:27.749 
300 from cold and dark one so first

00:00:27.749 --> 00:00:32.670 
300 from cold and dark one so first
let's<00:00:28.749> open<00:00:28.990> the<00:00:29.259> overhead<00:00:29.589> panel<00:00:31.349> now<00:00:32.349> switch

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:32.680 
let's open the overhead panel now switch

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:37.170 
let's open the overhead panel now switch
on<00:00:32.890> the<00:00:33.010> battery<00:00:33.570> right<00:00:34.570> here<00:00:34.630> and<00:00:36.060> start<00:00:37.060> the

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:37.180 
on the battery right here and start the

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:42.240 
on the battery right here and start the
APU<00:00:38.910> switch<00:00:39.910> on<00:00:40.180> the<00:00:40.300> APU<00:00:40.840> generator<00:00:41.220> became<00:00:42.220> a

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:42.250 
APU switch on the APU generator became a

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:47.600 
APU switch on the APU generator became a
new<00:00:42.490> reality<00:00:42.880> and<00:00:43.120> II<00:00:43.360> pass<00:00:43.990> it<00:00:45.750> now<00:00:46.750> open<00:00:47.230> the

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
new reality and II pass it now open the

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.330 
new reality and II pass it now open the
setup<00:00:48.610> command<00:00:48.970> and<00:00:49.240> connect<00:00:49.990> the<00:00:50.340> primary

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:51.340 
setup command and connect the primary

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:56.510 
setup command and connect the primary
external<00:00:51.880> power

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.290 

so<00:00:57.520> now<00:00:57.730> just<00:00:58.620> once<00:00:59.620> the<00:00:59.890> external<00:01:00.850> power<00:01:01.030> is

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:01.300 
so now just once the external power is

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.679 
so now just once the external power is
available<00:01:01.900> we<00:01:02.050> can<00:01:02.200> see<00:01:02.380> it<00:01:02.470> here<00:01:03.299> switch<00:01:04.299> LED

00:01:04.679 --> 00:01:04.689 
available we can see it here switch LED

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:08.130 
available we can see it here switch LED
on<00:01:04.900> and<00:01:05.759> now<00:01:06.759> we<00:01:06.820> have<00:01:07.150> most<00:01:07.450> system

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:08.140 
on and now we have most system

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:13.469 
on and now we have most system
functioning<00:01:09.420> so<00:01:11.219> switch<00:01:12.219> on<00:01:12.460> the<00:01:12.670> nav<00:01:13.240> lights

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:13.479 
functioning so switch on the nav lights

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:17.130 
functioning so switch on the nav lights
and<00:01:13.869> also<00:01:14.409> the<00:01:14.740> wind<00:01:15.219> lights<00:01:15.479> no<00:01:16.479> smoking<00:01:16.960> like

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:17.140 
and also the wind lights no smoking like

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:22.880 
and also the wind lights no smoking like
no<00:01:17.590> smoking<00:01:18.039> sign<00:01:18.429> on<00:01:20.609> to<00:01:21.609> center<00:01:22.179> hydraulic

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
no smoking sign on to center hydraulic

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.779 
no smoking sign on to center hydraulic
set<00:01:23.890> you<00:01:24.039> are<00:01:24.219> also<00:01:24.729> electrics<00:01:26.219> arm<00:01:27.219> the

00:01:27.779 --> 00:01:27.789 
set you are also electrics arm the

set you are also electrics arm the
emergency<00:01:28.329> lights<00:01:28.509> and<00:01:30.390> also<00:01:31.390> cap<00:01:33.240> switched

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:34.240 
emergency lights and also cap switched

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:38.639 
emergency lights and also cap switched
on<00:01:34.539> the<00:01:34.719> ADR<00:01:35.590> you<00:01:35.740> and<00:01:36.479> go<00:01:37.479> to<00:01:37.539> the<00:01:37.749> FMC<00:01:38.380> right

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:23.390 
switched to auto switch only bacon

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:29.420 
switched to auto switch only bacon
because<00:03:24.490> we're<00:03:25.490> gonna<00:03:25.670> stop<00:03:26.000> to<00:03:26.270> push<00:03:26.990> back

so for storing engines which of the two

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:41.750 
so for storing engines which of the two
bags<00:04:39.510> verify<00:04:40.080> that<00:04:40.260> the<00:04:40.380> APU<00:04:40.770> P<00:04:41.070> there<00:04:41.280> is<00:04:41.430> set

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:41.760 
bags verify that the APU P there is set
