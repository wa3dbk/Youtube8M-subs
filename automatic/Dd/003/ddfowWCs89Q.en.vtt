for<00:00:05.970> all<00:00:06.330> of<00:00:06.480> the<00:00:06.600> art<00:00:06.779> assets<00:00:07.170> that<00:00:07.589> we<00:00:07.770> need

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
for all of the art assets that we need

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.370 
for all of the art assets that we need
to<00:00:08.189> finish<00:00:08.370> the<00:00:08.639> game<00:00:08.790> and<00:00:09.120> it's<00:00:10.080> a<00:00:10.200> rather

advertising and a couple of tests assets
that<00:00:23.100> didn't<00:00:23.460> come<00:00:23.609> out<00:00:23.760> exactly<00:00:24.510> like<00:00:24.630> how<00:00:24.960> I

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
that didn't come out exactly like how I

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:32.209 
that didn't come out exactly like how I
wanted<00:00:25.410> for<00:00:25.650> example<00:00:26.099> these<00:00:26.300> clouds<00:00:29.929> and<00:00:31.219> i

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
wanted for example these clouds and i

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.799 
wanted for example these clouds and i
created<00:00:32.460> this<00:00:33.320> base<00:00:34.320> that<00:00:35.100> you<00:00:35.700> would<00:00:35.940> use<00:00:36.450> to

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
created this base that you would use to

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.619 
created this base that you would use to
build<00:00:37.290> a<00:00:37.469> town<00:00:37.680> on<00:00:37.860> top<00:00:38.070> of<00:00:38.280> i<00:00:38.629> wanted

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
build a town on top of i wanted

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.440 
build a town on top of i wanted
something<00:00:39.870> where<00:00:40.350> you<00:00:41.219> could<00:00:41.370> see<00:00:41.579> trails<00:00:41.910> and

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
something where you could see trails and

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.000 
something where you could see trails and
some<00:00:43.320> old<00:00:43.700> stone<00:00:44.700> walls<00:00:45.090> this<00:00:45.780> some<00:00:46.140> asset

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
some old stone walls this some asset

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.830 
some old stone walls this some asset
wasn't<00:00:47.340> finished<00:00:47.550> because<00:00:48.030> i<00:00:48.149> wasn't<00:00:48.390> very

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
wasn't finished because i wasn't very

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.439 
wasn't finished because i wasn't very
happy<00:00:49.020> with<00:00:49.230> it<00:00:49.530> but<00:00:49.559> I<00:00:49.710> learned<00:00:49.950> a<00:00:50.039> lot<00:00:50.190> and<00:00:50.489> I

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
happy with it but I learned a lot and I

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.330 
happy with it but I learned a lot and I
have<00:00:51.750> a<00:00:51.780> better<00:00:52.050> idea<00:00:52.110> of<00:00:52.469> what<00:00:52.680> i'd<00:00:52.800> like<00:00:52.829> to

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
have a better idea of what i'd like to

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.670 
have a better idea of what i'd like to
make<00:00:53.610> for<00:00:53.910> the<00:00:54.030> same<00:00:54.300> kind<00:00:54.930> of<00:00:55.079> asset<00:00:55.469> in<00:00:55.590> the

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
make for the same kind of asset in the

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:06.720 
make for the same kind of asset in the
future

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:06.730 

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:09.300 

I<00:01:06.790> did<00:01:07.480> make<00:01:07.750> one<00:01:08.020> other<00:01:08.200> test<00:01:08.620> asset<00:01:09.100> that<00:01:09.130> I

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:09.310 
I did make one other test asset that I

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:11.220 
I did make one other test asset that I
was<00:01:09.520> happier<00:01:09.910> with<00:01:10.120> and<00:01:10.360> that's<00:01:10.450> these<00:01:10.810> dense

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:11.230 
was happier with and that's these dense

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:14.580 
was happier with and that's these dense
trees<00:01:11.620> I<00:01:12.150> made<00:01:13.150> him<00:01:13.270> with<00:01:13.390> a<00:01:13.420> free<00:01:13.780> program

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:14.590 
trees I made him with a free program

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:20.820 
trees I made him with a free program
called<00:01:14.860> tree<00:01:15.640> D<00:01:16.110> and<00:01:18.630> basically<00:01:19.650> we<00:01:20.650> were

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:20.830 
called tree D and basically we were

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:23.120 
called tree D and basically we were
thinking<00:01:21.370> of<00:01:21.490> ways<00:01:21.640> to<00:01:21.700> simplify<00:01:22.300> the

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
thinking of ways to simplify the

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.410 
thinking of ways to simplify the
pipeline<00:01:24.130> of<00:01:24.400> getting<00:01:24.850> trees<00:01:25.120> into

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:25.420 
pipeline of getting trees into

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:27.510 
pipeline of getting trees into
overgrowth<00:01:25.900> while<00:01:26.350> making<00:01:26.890> the<00:01:27.130> trees<00:01:27.370> look

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:27.520 
overgrowth while making the trees look

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:34.710 
overgrowth while making the trees look
better<00:01:27.790> I<00:01:31.860> finally<00:01:32.860> finished<00:01:33.070> up<00:01:33.430> the<00:01:33.720> snow

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:34.720 
better I finally finished up the snow

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:38.550 
better I finally finished up the snow
blood<00:01:34.990> paladin<00:01:35.560> character<00:01:36.010> I<00:01:36.870> had<00:01:37.870> needed<00:01:38.380> to

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560 
blood paladin character I had needed to

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.590 
blood paladin character I had needed to
finish<00:01:38.950> the<00:01:39.280> color<00:01:39.580> textures<00:01:40.030> which<00:01:40.240> I<00:01:40.390> did

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:40.600 
finish the color textures which I did

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.130 
finish the color textures which I did
and<00:01:40.780> I<00:01:41.410> worked<00:01:42.070> quite<00:01:42.580> a<00:01:42.610> while<00:01:42.850> to<00:01:42.880> find<00:01:43.870> a

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:44.140 
and I worked quite a while to find a

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.770 
and I worked quite a while to find a
simple<00:01:44.560> way<00:01:44.680> to<00:01:44.710> condense<00:01:45.460> a<00:01:45.760> bunch<00:01:46.630> of

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:46.780 
simple way to condense a bunch of

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:48.450 
simple way to condense a bunch of
different<00:01:47.140> clothing<00:01:47.410> models<00:01:47.890> that<00:01:48.430> are

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:48.460 
different clothing models that are

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:50.990 
different clothing models that are
modular<00:01:48.760> into<00:01:49.630> one<00:01:49.960> character<00:01:50.410> model<00:01:50.800> and

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
modular into one character model and

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.280 
modular into one character model and
combine<00:01:52.000> all<00:01:52.150> the<00:01:52.240> textures<00:01:52.630> together<00:01:52.810> so<00:01:53.260> I

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:53.290 
combine all the textures together so I

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:56.640 
combine all the textures together so I
figured<00:01:53.380> that<00:01:53.830> out<00:01:53.860> and<00:01:55.440> finally<00:01:56.440> got<00:01:56.620> the

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:56.650 
figured that out and finally got the

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:07.080 
figured that out and finally got the
character<00:01:57.190> in<00:01:57.310> the<00:01:57.430> engine

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.090 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:10.150 

david<00:02:08.090> added<00:02:08.390> cloth<00:02:08.890> translucency<00:02:09.890> to<00:02:10.039> the

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
david added cloth translucency to the

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.260 
david added cloth translucency to the
character<00:02:10.550> shader<00:02:10.819> which<00:02:11.030> you<00:02:11.239> can<00:02:11.420> see<00:02:11.450> here

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
character shader which you can see here

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
character shader which you can see here
and<00:02:15.610> finally<00:02:16.610> i<00:02:16.790> did<00:02:17.120> the<00:02:17.270> alternate<00:02:17.840> version

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
and finally i did the alternate version

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:19.990 
and finally i did the alternate version
of<00:02:18.440> the<00:02:18.590> weapon<00:02:18.920> that<00:02:18.950> the<00:02:19.130> snow<00:02:19.489> blitz<00:02:19.730> use

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
of the weapon that the snow blitz use

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.500 
of the weapon that the snow blitz use
this<00:02:20.720> one<00:02:20.989> has<00:02:21.230> obsidian<00:02:21.950> flakes<00:02:22.280> for<00:02:23.180> the

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
this one has obsidian flakes for the

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:36.300 
this one has obsidian flakes for the
cutting<00:02:23.989> blades

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:39.850 

that's<00:02:37.310> it<00:02:37.550> for<00:02:37.880> the<00:02:38.209> overgrowth<00:02:38.900> art<00:02:39.290> asset
