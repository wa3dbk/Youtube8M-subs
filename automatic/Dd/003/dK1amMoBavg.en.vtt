00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:04.470
 hi to all and to all those months fle 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.200
 game 0,67 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.940
 how are you going I have 

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:13.200
 today we find ourselves 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:14.940
 and therefore good for the level Level 3 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.440
 So last time we did the 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:20.100
 little clock now we do the nest 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.660
 of 3 to order during this time as 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.939
 I had finished I had to customize the 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:29.630
 characters then so here I wanted 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:29.630
 would show planet cinematics always 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.379
 so we'll be in a hospital 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.820
 excuse me so I saw you the 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:50.879
 characters have changed a little 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:53.790
 so there is one wait there I know 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.979
 not if you see very much who screams this one 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:59.960
 it's open and the other one is red 

00:00:55.979 --> 00:01:05.640
 with a pool is therefore the one that is green 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:11.090
 excuse me it's the glass I put him 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:11.090
 a pool on the head 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:21.010
 so wait 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:23.860
 and something to do super here is yes 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:31.440
 but we do not care that it's good you there 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:36.850
 I said therefore between body and 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:43.930
 do not have fun barking on it so wait 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:47.920
 when a dog is here the little 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:52.500
 cinematic you see with my little 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:55.899
 green guy with the little red 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:02:04.830
 so I take my stuff so like 

00:01:55.899 --> 00:02:04.830
 I see it's raining 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:25.120
 so we have the little yellow stuff 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:27.860
 so we will have to capture that person 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:49.060
 so wait but here we go 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:52.100
 take in the capture that's it then 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:54.739
 so I think the thing down there 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:56.780
 young thing you see it's for in 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:03:00.100
 do the new wave we're going to fuck 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.100
 everywhere and
