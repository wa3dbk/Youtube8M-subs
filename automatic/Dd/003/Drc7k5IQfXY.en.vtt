00:00:13.399 --> 00:00:18.039
 we are about to have a close encounter with the tractor of the wild world 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:21.579
 the white rhinoceros 

00:00:21.579 --> 00:00:24.650
 and it is better to keep a very low profile 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:28.730
 the rhinoceros has very bad vision so if I keep almost chest 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:31.730
 Earth will not see me 

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:36.130
 the attacks on the front of the elderly 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:39.310
 I think to be alert because the sky 

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:42.310
 is on the field of play 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.700
 do not cut yourself 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:47.460
 Buenos Aires 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.860
 if for some reason that yes but not before getting to see me 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:53.920
 could roll me like a truck of two and a half tons 

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:58.240
 that is the weight of an adult rhinoceros 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:02.920
 the rhinoceros has a very good nose and with the wind against 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.550
 kick me running 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:07.760
 something that I have in my favor is that the wind is blowing towards this 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:08.510
 address 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:11.510
 if I kept blowing towards her I would be in serious trouble 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.270
 the linen white turban and luis white and black is also not smaller 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:19.870
 the difference between white rhino and black is not the color as many 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:20.530
 think 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:23.790
 Both black and white are exactly the same color 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.160
 the confusion is total to the English settlers came here to 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.160
 South Africa and they heard that the Dutch were saying 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.610
 and means wahid in English what is wide they interpreted as a glove 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.480
 joseph white and they were actually referring to that square violence 

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:43.050
 and it has said unlike the black rhinoceros that it is rather like peak of 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:44.270
 parrots 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.310
 if you sign on the face of Christ is quite long unlike the face of 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:50.580
 black rhinoceros that is shorter 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:53.450
 because because they will not be table with has to be 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.920
 eating grass all the time this allows you to be close to the ground 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.210
 instead the 3 to 0 before black as eating branches has the smallest face for 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:02.450
 can reach 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:04.470
 the works that are in the branches 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:10.160
 and if listening is the white rhinoceros is like a sound detector with 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.230
 those ears can detect any sound that comes from any direction 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:17.440
 because these are independent among these stressed that the guard 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:20.909
 which was chosen 

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:23.419
 and still he has answered 

00:02:23.419 --> 00:02:25.939
 Working hours independently 

00:02:25.939 --> 00:02:28.999
 the then ruler 

00:02:28.999 --> 00:02:31.559
 with a zero tie against Tehran 

00:02:31.559 --> 00:02:33.729
 a man who would be in October the other 

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:36.119
 so the two eat the 360 ​​degrees 

00:02:36.119 --> 00:02:39.509
 and are aware of any sound that may represent is dangerous 

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:44.099
 unfortunately it is not the lions of those who have to take care 

00:02:44.719 --> 00:02:47.999
 it is from us human beings 

00:02:47.999 --> 00:02:51.059
 in the late sixties unfortunately the number of 

00:02:51.059 --> 00:02:53.539
 white rhinoceroses in africa came down 

00:02:53.539 --> 00:02:56.539
 because due to the illegal hunting of rhinos 

00:02:59.149 --> 00:03:02.439
 the town is made up of keratin just like our nails 

00:03:02.939 --> 00:03:07.140
 and is still marketed in black markets of china and yemen for being 

00:03:07.139 --> 00:03:09.749
 considered an aphrodisiac 

00:03:09.749 --> 00:03:13.209
 fortunately in places such as water and that have protected this species 

00:03:14.189 --> 00:03:17.400
 it depends on us that the rhinoceros continues to walk on our planet
