00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:09.650
 key that we can do skewers in 

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:11.420
 our diet in fact the diet has 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:13.190
 that be fun and also not 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:15.290
 the diet has to be boring and heavy 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:18.259
 and we can choose skewers where there is not 

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:20.779
 much fried where there is not much sauce 

00:00:18.259 --> 00:00:24.290
 as a hilda for example as a spatter 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:26.750
 like something with squid with tuna 

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:28.250
 we must avoid a little sauce over 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:31.009
 all white and creamy sauces 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:32.840
 go more towards vegetables towards fish 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:33.980
 but of course we can find skewers 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:38.790
 Low calorie is a matter of 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:42.510
 look for them a little bit I'll put you on base 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:45.540
 well, a little bit of a kind of 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:49.770
 let's say in Libya below we can put 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:52.500
 a little bit of pickled bonito 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.450
 pickled tuna that's perfect 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.910
 less oil carry less oil very 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:59.850
 well and then well we would play with a little 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:02.309
 of cress with a little bit of cheek 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.830
 chopped of the corns how much pica 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.740
 and with a little bite of it this red 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.540
 which is also affected colorful and what 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:13.110
 that were left so we put a little 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:15.509
 chopped chives has been the filleting of 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.430
 juliana also to be a perfect 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:19.650
 and we also have blue fish that is going 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.000
 great for cholesterol for the 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.350
 tension and that you have to encourage 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.060
 consumption of blue fish 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:28.110
 we now start with the 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:30.840
 Blue fish season 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.660
 tuna bonito 30 nicest to none and 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:36.960
 we started now in June delicious 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:38.759
 delicious and healthy and versatile for 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.190
 you guys from summer villamil stuff me 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:43.680
 love because they wonderful things 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:46.260
 which are the small squid in 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:49.020
 hook and that is the tuna and the bonito 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:57.380
 I have both things because 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:57.380
 phenomenon we also have more tasty 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:03.780
 that's how finer more is more expensive and 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.780
 it is also blue fish everything is fish 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:10.920
 blue omega 3 circulation be perfect 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:13.440
 have been overweight we have already talked about 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:16.380
 that we are going to try to avoid or reduce or 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:19.950
 take less skewers then battered 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:22.230
 fried with white sauces with creams we 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:25.890
 let's go more then to the salpicones al 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:28.230
 seafood to the vegetable skewers other 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:30.120
 thing is cholesterol cholesterol what 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:33.810
 Only the original food goes up 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:35.610
 animal minus the blue fish that helps 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.680
 lower it but all the food of 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.990
 animal origin have cholesterol in 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.210
 change no food of plant origin 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:44.370
 has cholesterol and I ask you the 

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:47.760
 chips have cholesterol 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:49.980
 the oil but it is vegetable the oil 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.840
 then the chips do not have 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:54.450
 cholesterol another thing is to put him 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:57.060
 so a sauce and potato pats 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:03:00.690
 example that if they already carry egg on 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:02.879
 sauce and that but cholesterol is alone 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.980
 alone and exclusively in the kingdom 

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:06.720
 animal and also a little bit of 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.750
 cholesterol is necessary Romans when 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:12.299
 we spent how to lower cholesterol 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:13.860
 to go more food of vegetable origin and 

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:16.799
 to fish especially blue fish 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:20.670
 lose calories try to lower fats 

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:23.489
 to the maximum avoiding fried batters and 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:25.319
 white sauces any bread you have 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:28.079
 little crumb as Juan Mari said for 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:31.360
 do not get wet I say well juanmari can 

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:34.360
 be good and adequate to do 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:37.510
 spikes but let's remember one thing has 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:40.180
 the same calories the wholemeal bread that 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:42.760
 the white bread the only difference if the 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:44.620
 wholemeal bread has more fiber has something 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:47.620
 more nutrient and that fills a little bit 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:49.900
 more and maybe instead of five skewers 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:51.970
 with four skewers complemented with bread 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:54.070
 member of enough speeches 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:56.230
 dreams the same lives calories in 

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:57.940
 hatay we thought that the black bread and 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:59.140
 everything and soft fat less calories 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:00.970
 they are the same what happens as 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:04.050
 has more fiber filled more and then 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:04.050
 you end up eating less
