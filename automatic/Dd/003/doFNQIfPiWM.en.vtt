that's<00:04:20.799> the<00:04:21.099> building<00:04:21.400> instructions<00:04:22.150> no<00:04:22.419> you

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:23.260 
that's the building instructions no you

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.020 
that's the building instructions no you
have<00:04:23.470> the<00:04:23.620> feet<00:04:23.919> back<00:04:24.190> to<00:04:24.370> front<00:04:24.580> I'm<00:04:24.760> quite

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:25.030 
have the feet back to front I'm quite

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:28.620 
have the feet back to front I'm quite
sure<00:04:25.270> we<00:04:25.300> do<00:04:25.570> yes<00:04:25.810> we<00:04:26.020> do<00:04:26.169> and<00:04:27.150> then<00:04:28.150> we<00:04:28.300> can<00:04:28.479> put

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:28.630 
sure we do yes we do and then we can put

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:33.650 
sure we do yes we do and then we can put
the<00:04:28.780> head<00:04:28.990> on<00:04:29.139> and<00:04:29.620> we<00:04:30.210> get<00:04:31.210> this<00:04:32.200> little<00:04:32.440> piece

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:33.660 
the head on and we get this little piece

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:38.750 
the head on and we get this little piece
there<00:04:34.370> which<00:04:35.370> goes<00:04:35.700> in<00:04:36.060> the<00:04:36.090> ear<00:04:37.760> section

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:38.760 
there which goes in the ear section

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:41.780 
there which goes in the ear section
there<00:04:39.000> and<00:04:39.810> that<00:04:40.020> is<00:04:40.200> a<00:04:40.230> little<00:04:40.470> flower<00:04:40.950> I<00:04:41.250> will

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:41.790 
there and that is a little flower I will

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:44.600 
there and that is a little flower I will
not<00:04:41.970> put<00:04:42.150> the<00:04:42.300> boys<00:04:42.810> on<00:04:43.110> this<00:04:43.260> time<00:04:43.560> as<00:04:44.250> I<00:04:44.370> just

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:44.610 
not put the boys on this time as I just

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:47.240 
not put the boys on this time as I just
showed<00:04:44.940> you<00:04:44.970> how<00:04:45.930> to<00:04:45.960> do<00:04:46.290> that<00:04:46.470> but<00:04:46.950> the<00:04:47.070> eyes

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:47.250 
showed you how to do that but the eyes

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:50.180 
showed you how to do that but the eyes
are<00:04:47.280> exactly<00:04:48.090> the<00:04:48.330> same<00:04:48.570> as<00:04:49.230> the<00:04:49.500> last<00:04:49.710> one<00:04:49.920> so

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:50.190 
are exactly the same as the last one so

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:52.700 
are exactly the same as the last one so
I<00:04:50.490> would<00:04:50.970> imagine<00:04:51.060> every<00:04:51.630> single<00:04:51.660> figure<00:04:52.560> that

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:52.710 
I would imagine every single figure that

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:54.410 
I would imagine every single figure that
comes<00:04:52.890> with<00:04:53.130> these<00:04:53.310> will<00:04:53.940> get<00:04:54.090> the<00:04:54.180> same

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:54.420 
comes with these will get the same

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:59.540 
comes with these will get the same
stickers<00:04:55.460> for<00:04:56.460> the<00:04:56.520> eyes<00:04:56.790> so<00:04:58.040> you<00:04:59.040> can<00:04:59.310> choose

00:04:59.540 --> 00:04:59.550 
stickers for the eyes so you can choose

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:02.720 
stickers for the eyes so you can choose
four<00:05:00.210> different<00:05:00.630> styles<00:05:00.900> and<00:05:01.320> try<00:05:02.190> and<00:05:02.400> get

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:02.730 
four different styles and try and get

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:05.090 
four different styles and try and get
this<00:05:02.880> one<00:05:03.120> open<00:05:03.360> a<00:05:03.660> bit<00:05:03.810> better<00:05:04.050> that<00:05:04.920> was<00:05:05.070> a

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:05.100 
this one open a bit better that was a

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:07.580 
this one open a bit better that was a
little<00:05:05.280> better<00:05:05.570> that's<00:05:06.570> more<00:05:06.900> like<00:05:07.140> a<00:05:07.260> kinder

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:07.590 
little better that's more like a kinder

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:12.170 
little better that's more like a kinder
egg<00:05:07.620> Neely<00:05:08.600> Neely<00:05:09.600> there<00:05:09.990> but<00:05:10.770> not<00:05:11.190> close<00:05:11.850> and

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:12.180 
egg Neely Neely there but not close and

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:16.070 
egg Neely Neely there but not close and
not<00:05:12.710> very<00:05:13.710> first<00:05:14.130> tip<00:05:14.730> this<00:05:14.940> one<00:05:15.120> eight<00:05:15.300> and<00:05:15.540> it

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:16.080 
not very first tip this one eight and it

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:19.370 
not very first tip this one eight and it
is<00:05:16.290> the<00:05:16.500> same<00:05:17.180> as<00:05:18.180> the<00:05:18.450> last<00:05:18.630> one<00:05:18.810> is<00:05:19.020> it<00:05:19.140> no<00:05:19.320> it

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:19.380 
is the same as the last one is it no it

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:22.460 
is the same as the last one is it no it
isn't<00:05:19.770> actually<00:05:19.920> it<00:05:20.670> is<00:05:20.970> the<00:05:21.180> same<00:05:21.480> pose<00:05:22.020> as

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:22.470 
isn't actually it is the same pose as

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:25.880 
isn't actually it is the same pose as
that's<00:05:23.400> one<00:05:23.640> but<00:05:23.820> the<00:05:23.910> same<00:05:24.180> color<00:05:24.540> dress<00:05:25.380> is

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:25.890 
that's one but the same color dress is

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:28.640 
that's one but the same color dress is
the<00:05:26.220> last<00:05:26.430> one<00:05:26.750> so<00:05:27.750> it<00:05:27.870> is<00:05:27.990> basically<00:05:28.440> the<00:05:28.620> same

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:28.650 
the last one so it is basically the same

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:30.980 
the last one so it is basically the same
as<00:05:29.010> the<00:05:29.130> yellow<00:05:29.430> one<00:05:29.640> with<00:05:30.330> in<00:05:30.570> a<00:05:30.720> different

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:30.990 
as the yellow one with in a different

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:34.280 
as the yellow one with in a different
color<00:05:31.650> and<00:05:32.510> this<00:05:33.510> one<00:05:33.750> does<00:05:33.930> come<00:05:33.960> with<00:05:34.230> a

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:34.290 
color and this one does come with a

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:37.190 
color and this one does come with a
different<00:05:34.860> piece<00:05:35.550> for<00:05:36.180> the<00:05:36.300> ear<00:05:36.570> as<00:05:36.750> well<00:05:36.780> T's

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:37.200 
different piece for the ear as well T's

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:40.540 
different piece for the ear as well T's
a<00:05:37.410> little<00:05:38.400> bow<00:05:38.520> so<00:05:38.730> it<00:05:38.760> is<00:05:39.120> an<00:05:39.390> alternate

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:40.550 
a little bow so it is an alternate

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:41.830 
a little bow so it is an alternate
figure

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:41.840 
figure

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:45.980 
figure
although<00:05:42.840> the<00:05:43.080> pose<00:05:43.380> is<00:05:43.800> about<00:05:44.790> the<00:05:45.390> same<00:05:45.690> as

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:45.990 
although the pose is about the same as

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:48.560 
although the pose is about the same as
the<00:05:46.830> yellow<00:05:47.280> one<00:05:47.640> these<00:05:47.880> can<00:05:48.090> be<00:05:48.180> a<00:05:48.210> little

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:48.570 
the yellow one these can be a little

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:51.670 
the yellow one these can be a little
fiddly<00:05:48.990> at<00:05:49.260> times<00:05:49.530> so<00:05:50.370> you<00:05:50.460> get<00:05:50.610> into<00:05:51.030> place

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:51.680 
fiddly at times so you get into place

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:56.450 
fiddly at times so you get into place
what's<00:05:52.680> where<00:05:53.180> those<00:05:54.180> of<00:05:54.330> this<00:05:54.419> go<00:05:55.070> they<00:05:56.070> go

00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:56.460 
what's where those of this go they go

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:58.210 
what's where those of this go they go
today<00:05:56.820> I'm<00:05:57.000> quite<00:05:57.300> sure<00:05:57.480> it<00:05:57.630> goes<00:05:57.780> like<00:05:58.050> that

00:05:58.210 --> 00:05:58.220 
today I'm quite sure it goes like that

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:00.580 
today I'm quite sure it goes like that
is<00:05:59.220> that<00:05:59.370> correct

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:00.590 
is that correct

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:04.159 
is that correct
anyway<00:06:01.590> these<00:06:02.310> are<00:06:02.370> the<00:06:02.520> bow<00:06:02.850> it<00:06:03.630> is<00:06:03.840> a<00:06:03.870> little

00:06:04.159 --> 00:06:04.169 
anyway these are the bow it is a little

00:06:04.169 --> 00:06:06.740 
anyway these are the bow it is a little
fiddly<00:06:04.800> to<00:06:04.980> do<00:06:05.490> it<00:06:05.610> right<00:06:05.790> now<00:06:06.120> so<00:06:06.419> we'll<00:06:06.600> leave

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:06.750 
fiddly to do it right now so we'll leave

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:07.790 
fiddly to do it right now so we'll leave
that<00:06:06.810> to<00:06:07.110> one<00:06:07.140> side

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:07.800 
that to one side

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:09.530 
that to one side
well<00:06:08.310> there<00:06:08.490> you<00:06:08.550> can<00:06:08.730> see<00:06:09.000> these<00:06:09.180> two<00:06:09.510> are

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:09.540 
well there you can see these two are

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:12.080 
well there you can see these two are
exactly<00:06:10.200> the<00:06:10.410> same<00:06:10.440> just<00:06:11.250> with<00:06:11.340> a<00:06:11.550> different

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:12.090 
exactly the same just with a different

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:14.870 
exactly the same just with a different
boat<00:06:12.690> applied<00:06:13.440> to<00:06:13.710> them<00:06:13.950> but<00:06:14.520> there<00:06:14.640> you<00:06:14.730> have

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:14.880 
boat applied to them but there you have

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:17.270 
boat applied to them but there you have
