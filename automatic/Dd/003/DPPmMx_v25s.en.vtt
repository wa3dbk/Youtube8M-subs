00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.610
 I on my facebook and also had indicated that there was between cercedilla by 

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:07.709
 please send me the question that you want me to have asked 

00:00:08.239 --> 00:00:10.289
 the 99 points 

00:00:10.289 --> 00:00:12.559
 9% is 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:14.080
 how is it maintained 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:15.589
 as well 

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:17.699
 why nothing 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.150
 the people that look at me like to do minted mucus exercise 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.490
 on another occasion when we talked about how we do not keep from ccoo like 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:26.779
 our work 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:30.999
 are different hours this uncle loved very much and one has to 

00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:35.540
 somehow to endure all that train of work you have to look for the 

00:00:35.539 --> 00:00:39.379
 way to strengthen train on the other hand was oriented as I went to the gym 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:44.580
 out of what I like and that makes me feel good emotionally also 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:46.470
 physically it makes me feel good 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:50.449
 and he invented me and helps me in that as I have 

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:53.140
 this much displacement of the casyc's stage 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:56.870
 in fact and how training as a polybaruta and robert shiller as 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:59.650
 athlete and I have to do exercise 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:02.409
 and lift or good food not just wall 

00:01:02.409 --> 00:01:08.430
 jorge monroe georgia apple of the liquid and on stage so either 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.220
 those who ethic their diet and exercise little bit of manilva 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:17.480
 life there is also a connection dlna that I have to do as I mentioned the 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:19.030
 cv seba paper 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:23.299
 I have still offer as the first round of the cup here 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:28.760
 we are with rosemary but I do not like the exercise also the valence since 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:31.010
 they keep the decision ccc 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:32.550
 and my career that 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:35.960
 it is a positive part you know inside 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.659
 In concert series you will visit several cities in the state of Arizona 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.380
 what happens this anti-immigrant law 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.410
 that's why you felt different 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:50.220
 indifferent when you got the news that this anti-immigrant law and point you're going 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.450
 to present to this state if I am going to present myself state and supporting the 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:57.350
 dutch and in hey the people want 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.930
 that is here in this country that the country that gives the opportunity and I tell you 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.540
 which is like going back in time when I heard about the law like saying one that 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:08.200
 wants to break the border we are all together to help each other 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.530
 I followed in this case what they want to establish a clear barrier that 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.830
 it hurt and I'm fully supporting to say no to that law to look 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:20.130
 this other vehicles for there to be harmony and for there really to be the 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:25.070
 correct decision and bring a normal and harmonious thing to do because what 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:29.530
 it is created with legends and it is a blow among human beings that it does not have to 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.880
 there's also physical violence and that's where we can not get in basically 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:37.749
 ll with the word is that we have to resolve our matter because 

00:02:38.359 --> 00:02:42.439
 that's why we are going to evolve it for good luis albarrÃ¡n not back to 

00:02:42.439 --> 00:02:45.129
 embezzle then in my opinion to this 

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:47.729
 and I'm going to introduce myself, I'll be giving all my energy 

00:02:47.729 --> 00:02:51.909
 that what we eat we are living where it grows very and where nemo 

00:02:51.909 --> 00:02:53.179
 developed but 

00:02:53.179 --> 00:02:57.219
 but it really blew up in a law that gives me as a kick back efe something 

00:02:57.219 --> 00:02:59.719
 special that you think you are going to plan to do 

00:02:59.719 --> 00:03:03.450
 this concert in arizona not for this concert in arizona I'm going to very broad what 

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:04.739
 that is all the energy 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:08.890
 kahlo as as what is that currently are not we have nuncio 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:12.030
 that we are going to take as I say energy force 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.640
 and dedicate it to all the people who have supported my career when I have 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:19.990
 of 30 years and career fiorella access a large network leave because I 

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:22.969
 I go because I have people who support me that if I did not have people 

00:03:22.969 --> 00:03:27.530
 this one that you support me and obviously one thing to this logical expo would not be 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:30.029
 on stage I think everything we're 

00:03:30.029 --> 00:03:33.739
 in the world we work for anyone although bayona person to enter 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:38.049
 buy a shirt on we depend on the public is somehow done all 

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:41.279
 we depend on everyone and and if I am in this race because the public 

00:03:41.279 --> 00:03:42.269
 kept here
