want to evolve uh-uh usually the points

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.230 
want to evolve uh-uh usually the points
are<00:01:11.010> evolving<00:01:11.280> as<00:01:11.580> new<00:01:11.729> things<00:01:11.939> are<00:01:12.060> going<00:01:12.180> to

general<00:01:30.299> after<00:01:30.450> pendulum<00:01:31.320> summon<00:01:31.560> what's

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
general after pendulum summon what's

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.190 
general after pendulum summon what's
next<00:01:32.009> it's<00:01:33.000> a<00:01:33.030> long<00:01:33.270> time<00:01:33.479> from<00:01:33.540> Al<00:01:33.780> probably

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
next it's a long time from Al probably

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.630 
next it's a long time from Al probably
from<00:01:34.470> what<00:01:34.619> the<00:01:34.710> cycle<00:01:34.979> says<00:01:35.130> about<00:01:35.310> two<00:01:35.490> or

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
from what the cycle says about two or

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.670 
from what the cycle says about two or
three<00:01:35.820> years<00:01:36.060> so<00:01:36.630> two<00:01:36.689> or<00:01:37.079> three<00:01:37.229> years<00:01:37.320> what's

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
three years so two or three years what's

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.640 
three years so two or three years what's
next<00:01:37.890> well<00:01:38.610> you<00:01:38.759> know<00:01:38.850> I<00:01:38.880> don't<00:01:39.030> know<00:01:39.470> but<00:01:40.470> I

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
next well you know I don't know but I

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:41.899 
next well you know I don't know but I
want<00:01:40.860> to<00:01:40.950> go<00:01:41.009> back<00:01:41.040> in<00:01:41.340> time<00:01:41.430> and<00:01:41.490> show<00:01:41.670> you<00:01:41.729> why

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
want to go back in time and show you why

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.940 
want to go back in time and show you why
evolving<00:01:42.329> is<00:01:42.420> good<00:01:42.570> the<00:01:43.140> game<00:01:43.350> was<00:01:43.590> stuck<00:01:43.920> for

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
evolving is good the game was stuck for

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.580 
evolving is good the game was stuck for
a<00:01:44.189> while<00:01:44.399> I<00:01:45.030> wasn't<00:01:45.720> into<00:01:46.020> it<00:01:46.049> but<00:01:46.290> from<00:01:46.470> what

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
a while I wasn't into it but from what

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:47.899 
a while I wasn't into it but from what
I've<00:01:46.740> read<00:01:46.950> and<00:01:47.130> seen<00:01:47.280> it<00:01:47.369> and<00:01:47.460> I<00:01:47.549> did<00:01:47.729> play

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
I've read and seen it and I did play

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.389 
I've read and seen it and I did play
back<00:01:48.119> then<00:01:48.329> and<00:01:48.560> the<00:01:49.560> reason<00:01:49.799> why<00:01:50.009> I<00:01:50.040> stopped

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
back then and the reason why I stopped

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.039 
back then and the reason why I stopped
playing<00:01:50.430> is<00:01:50.850> because<00:01:51.180> everything<00:01:51.840> turned

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
playing is because everything turned

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.740 
playing is because everything turned
into<00:01:52.200> like<00:01:52.259> heroes<00:01:53.210> that<00:01:54.210> my<00:01:54.390> friends<00:01:54.689> were

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
into like heroes that my friends were

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.929

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
playing level monsters been taken out

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.340 
playing level monsters been taken out
armed<00:01:57.180> dragons<00:01:57.659> our<00:01:57.780> friends<00:01:58.020> write<00:01:58.140> a<00:01:58.170> play

armed dragons our friends write a play

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.289 
armed dragons our friends write a play
but<00:01:58.530> it<00:01:58.619> didn't<00:01:58.770> work<00:01:58.860> out<00:01:59.040> the<00:01:59.880> new<00:02:00.000> fairy

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
but it didn't work out the new fairy

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:01.429 
but it didn't work out the new fairy
archetype<00:02:00.719> didn't<00:02:00.960> work<00:02:01.049> out<00:02:01.170> and<00:02:01.350> I<00:02:01.409> know

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
archetype didn't work out and I know

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.020 
archetype didn't work out and I know
there's<00:02:01.710> other<00:02:01.799> decks<00:02:02.130> but<00:02:02.340> I<00:02:02.520> wasn't<00:02:02.850> into

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
there's other decks but I wasn't into

good<00:02:04.439> decks<00:02:04.680> were<00:02:04.860> back<00:02:05.040> then<00:02:05.250> but<00:02:05.820> heroes

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
good decks were back then but heroes

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:07.969 
good decks were back then but heroes
just<00:02:06.509> took<00:02:06.659> everything<00:02:06.869> fusions<00:02:07.590> just<00:02:07.799> went

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
just took everything fusions just went

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:08.990 
just took everything fusions just went
off<00:02:08.160> and<00:02:08.340> then<00:02:08.459> it<00:02:08.580> would<00:02:08.670> just

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
off and then it would just

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.999 
off and then it would just
hero<00:02:09.750> fusions<00:02:10.289> are<00:02:10.410> the<00:02:10.470> only<00:02:10.619> things<00:02:10.830> that

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
hero fusions are the only things that

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.370 
hero fusions are the only things that
stayed<00:02:11.310> and<00:02:11.550> then<00:02:11.910> no<00:02:12.090> other<00:02:12.420> role<00:02:12.690> Fusion

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.600 
even use I mean gly beeston even use
polymerization<00:02:19.260> so<00:02:19.860> I<00:02:19.890> want<00:02:20.130> consider<00:02:20.460> that

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
polymerization so I want consider that

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.940

like<00:02:20.760> a<00:02:20.790> fusion<00:02:21.360> deck<00:02:21.570> then<00:02:22.050> seekers<00:02:22.500> came<00:02:22.740> and

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
like a fusion deck then seekers came and

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.980 
like a fusion deck then seekers came and
it<00:02:23.040> really<00:02:23.460> liven<00:02:23.820> up<00:02:24.060> the<00:02:24.240> game<00:02:24.420> like<00:02:24.750> I<00:02:24.840> mean

last set of five days it was crazy you

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:35.720 
last set of five days it was crazy you
haven't<00:02:34.470> seen<00:02:34.650> that<00:02:34.680> type<00:02:35.070> of<00:02:35.100> stuff<00:02:35.459> since

haven't seen that type of stuff since

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.660 
haven't seen that type of stuff since
well<00:02:35.970> the<00:02:36.930> game<00:02:37.170> started<00:02:37.770> I'd<00:02:37.920> feel<00:02:38.190> even<00:02:38.490> when

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
well the game started I'd feel even when

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.520 
well the game started I'd feel even when
the<00:02:38.820> e<00:02:38.850> hero<00:02:39.270> infusions<00:02:39.870> things<00:02:40.110> were<00:02:40.290> coming

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
the e hero infusions things were coming

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.020 
the e hero infusions things were coming
out<00:02:40.620> in<00:02:40.740> dark<00:02:40.980> world<00:02:41.190> and<00:02:41.370> all<00:02:41.430> that<00:02:41.580> you<00:02:41.850> never

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
out in dark world and all that you never

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.630 
out in dark world and all that you never
seen<00:02:42.330> some<00:02:42.630> such<00:02:43.020> a<00:02:43.050> drastic<00:02:43.440> change<00:02:43.739> to<00:02:44.310> the

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
seen some such a drastic change to the

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.670 
seen some such a drastic change to the
game<00:02:44.820> now<00:02:45.330> exceeds<00:02:45.720> were<00:02:45.930> a<00:02:45.959> little<00:02:46.200> less<00:02:46.500> of

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
game now exceeds were a little less of

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.490 
game now exceeds were a little less of
an<00:02:49.680> evolution<00:02:50.430> because<00:02:51.270> they<00:02:51.780> were<00:02:51.840> taken<00:02:52.350> off

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
an evolution because they were taken off

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.860 
an evolution because they were taken off
synchros<00:02:53.040> in<00:02:53.340> a<00:02:53.520> way<00:02:53.700> yeah<00:02:53.970> there's<00:02:54.330> materials

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
synchros in a way yeah there's materials

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:55.940 
synchros in a way yeah there's materials
that<00:02:54.959> stuff<00:02:55.080> like<00:02:55.200> that<00:02:55.230> but<00:02:55.440> it's<00:02:55.590> still<00:02:55.709> kind

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
that stuff like that but it's still kind

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:57.290 
that stuff like that but it's still kind
of<00:02:56.040> like<00:02:56.220> you<00:02:56.610> take<00:02:56.790> from<00:02:56.880> your<00:02:57.030> extra<00:02:57.270> deck

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.300 
of like you take from your extra deck

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:59.690 
of like you take from your extra deck
and<00:02:57.959> it's<00:02:58.200> easier<00:02:58.620> and<00:02:58.650> I<00:02:58.830> know<00:02:58.890> people<00:02:59.610> could

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
and it's easier and I know people could

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.610 
and it's easier and I know people could
say<00:02:59.880> that's<00:03:00.060> what<00:03:00.360> singers<00:03:00.690> were<00:03:00.840> of<00:03:01.050> based<00:03:01.470> on

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
say that's what singers were of based on

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.440 
say that's what singers were of based on
a<00:03:01.650> few<00:03:01.860> polymerization<00:03:02.459> it<00:03:02.700> was<00:03:02.850> because<00:03:03.180> it

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
a few polymerization it was because it

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:04.820 
a few polymerization it was because it
was<00:03:03.510> more<00:03:03.720> game<00:03:03.959> breaking<00:03:04.200> I<00:03:04.470> was<00:03:04.680> a<00:03:04.709> lot

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830 
was more game breaking I was a lot

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:06.290 
was more game breaking I was a lot
easier<00:03:04.890> to<00:03:05.220> pull<00:03:05.370> off<00:03:05.520> and<00:03:05.730> pretty<00:03:05.910> much<00:03:06.030> any

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 
easier to pull off and pretty much any

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:07.720 
easier to pull off and pretty much any
deck<00:03:06.540> that<00:03:06.720> played<00:03:06.870> a<00:03:06.900> tuner<00:03:07.200> could<00:03:07.350> do<00:03:07.440> it

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
deck that played a tuner could do it

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:09.830 
deck that played a tuner could do it

can't<00:03:10.170> do<00:03:10.260> it<00:03:10.350> well<00:03:10.620> that's<00:03:10.890> why<00:03:11.070> exercise

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
can't do it well that's why exercise

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:12.800 
can't do it well that's why exercise
these<00:03:11.550> weren't<00:03:11.730> as<00:03:11.880> big<00:03:12.060> because<00:03:12.300> a<00:03:12.480> lot<00:03:12.780> of

these weren't as big because a lot of

these weren't as big because a lot of
decks<00:03:13.140> pretty<00:03:13.620> much<00:03:13.709> anyone<00:03:13.980> can<00:03:14.280> run<00:03:14.670> a

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
decks pretty much anyone can run a

up a generic generic synchro like
