00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:06.270
 dear gardeners let's look at 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.849
 ours with you 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:13.019
 callas we grow color 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:17.940
 seed screens take a look at our 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:21.480
 girl cola december 27 13 see 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:24.750
 yes these were sown seeds which 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:28.920
 collected and who watched this process 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:31.019
 probably interesting you will see 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.529
 what happened next today 26 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:36.020
 February 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:39.870
 let's see means in some 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:43.770
 hotels here you see well you or 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:46.079
 met the points here such 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:50.910
 here closes a tubular leaflet 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:55.949
 yet many 3 conceived check 3 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:59.760
 see a little leaf and I will not dig a 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:02.489
 Now the point is that I believe that 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:06.060
 it's time to transplant them because 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:10.439
 painfully close but if not 13 then 11 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:12.240
 probably there are exactly two times like this 4 5 6 7 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:15.390
 8 9 10 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:19.500
 I counted 10 so I want to extract from 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:25.110
 this closet in which they eat 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:28.140
 from December 27 and now look now we are with 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:30.210
 you transplant them harvested such 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.600
 containers I took out from under the cookies 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.790
 container opaque you know what 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.360
 better to use opaque to 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:42.420
 root system developed correctly 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:45.600
 filled with vermiculite soil mixture 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.909
 and ulala all pre with 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.060
 potassium permanganate with potassium permanganate yes a 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:53.009
 will now pull out 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:55.950
 received will stretch and sold on 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:58.020
 more comfortable why took you narrow 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:01.610
 more comfortable on the windowsill as instead 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:04.649
 almost no see what's next 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:09.319
 so just for the purity of the experiment i 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:11.350
 Now I will remove this soil which I 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:13.660
 taken together to shit 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:19.260
 day them reckless box and see 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:21.880
 how does this plant look today 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:25.900
 Do you develop depth here? 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:30.390
 root system and so my 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:34.540
 experimenters dear let's study 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:37.180
 that's what is the third leaf here it is 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:40.390
 two pretty ones appear 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:45.520
 what stalk is good and here is the bud 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:48.360
 tuber to which we expect here 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:50.980
 such a pretty root system 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:53.920
 it is clear that the place is 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:55.780
 slight thickening takes place i think 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:58.120
 that from this place will just be 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:01.180
 develop a tuber without thinking exactly 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:02.860
 it should be further we will observe 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:06.280
 also i will open 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:08.530
 1 time senic and we will see how 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:11.970
 og from seed grows 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:14.740
 colored callas are now landing 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:16.660
 Well , friends, look, I finished 

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:19.180
 the transplant that we had was 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:22.030
 eleven plants of 5 each 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:24.010
 the box now I have you saw 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:27.220
 how the root system develops 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:30.250
 say that the height of this container 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:32.290
 I think all the same is not enough of course 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:34.990
 a lot here in 6 centimeters probably 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:37.030
 I need to go deeper into my mind 

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:40.030
 the plant was most fortunate here 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:43.120
 big glass but here of course there will be 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:45.550
 root development is much better not waiting 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.770
 I'll wait for spring and when it all lands 

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:50.320
 in the soil in the chest I will take a special 

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:52.840
 The garden for colored call where will 

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:55.180
 develop tuber with supplements 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:57.610
 mineral and organic and creating 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:01.300
 all necessary conditions for this 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:02.020
 what else do I want to say this year I will not 

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:04.750
 sow 

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:07.540
 mouth sperm or African daisy i 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:12.010
 didn't already tell you in my back 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:14.860
 January I have seed records 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:17.859
 plant varieties I advise you very much 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:22.180
 I will not plant but planted every year 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:23.160
 self-sowing to beautiful is called just a 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:26.220
 give in 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:29.070
 mine large seeds are so sturdy 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:31.710
 Now I will show you these bushes 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:35.760
 really have a blue such 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:38.900
 dark purple me core you 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:41.460
 know the flowers are white 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:43.220
 neat as if just now 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:47.070
 painted about here with oil paints 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:50.040
 such beautiful dense flowers and the whole 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:52.020
 the bush is just strewn with them I am very 

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:55.620
 I advise you to sow I just have not 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:58.050
 I do not like the place in terms of fit 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:00.000
 but if self-seeding there curse somewhere 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:02.750
 I will be very happy though very much in the fall 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.310
 much has risen here now closer to you 

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:06.620
 I will substitute agrotechnology can you 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:12.840
 will be able to read 

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:15.330
 sow need to be written march but i tell you 

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:17.970
 I advise but as it were, already in March 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:21.690
 right here now here on the nose start if 

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:24.480
 You do not buy this seed very much 

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:28.380
 I recommend you what is this 

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:31.580
 seeds look I collected them in the fall 

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:34.650
 this F1 is no letter to f1 look 

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:39.060
 so the seeds here I collect 

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:44.190
 their own and store in general is here 

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:48.780
 in such here they are in my tank 

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:53.130
 box now get it 

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:57.020
 look daisy blue led awn mustache 

00:05:53.130 --> 00:06:00.990
 first so called 

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:03.990
 Here's what the seeds look 

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:07.320
 what large look what large 

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:10.200
 that is, they will rise beautiful to you just 

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:12.620
 I guarantee it do not buy expensive 

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:15.810
 there are some varietal extraordinary 

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:17.810
 if they have the same color as i am 

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:20.610
 I showed you now 

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:23.190
 amazing there are shops where up to 100 with 

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:26.160
 the extra cost of seeds comes in rubles 

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:27.690
 can buy much cheaper to grow 

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:31.700
 then grow then by yourself 

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:33.009
 alone but have had spine 

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:35.949
 varietal 

00:06:33.009 --> 00:06:38.379
 there are of course just unique between 

00:06:35.949 --> 00:06:41.289
 leaves some outgrowths to grow them 

00:06:38.379 --> 00:06:43.659
 some kind of crest that's who's carried away 

00:06:41.289 --> 00:06:48.159
 these plants, I think you will not 

00:06:43.659 --> 00:06:51.129
 sorry once buy now and 

00:06:48.159 --> 00:06:54.369
