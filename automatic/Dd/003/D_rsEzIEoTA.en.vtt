00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:10.380
 ubisoft oh no no no of course only 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:12.030
 fun 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.219
 this time it's not about assassin's 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.590
 creed in persona but of course 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.779
 the game capturing from the ps4 yes the 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.630
 that's what's great, too 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.949
 and it works very simple in 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.410
 compared to xbox bonn 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.390
 because the ps4 buffett namely from the beginning 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.519
 at the same time 15 minutes in their 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.140
 memory later, it offers you the then 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.730
 to cut them together 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.870
 that's pretty smart was like that 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.500
 you can not do anything 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.390
 miss 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.040
 which is much cooler by the share 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.020
 Taste where the whole picture was taken and 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.219
 then we later see the menu 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.230
 I then no problem for you 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.489
 you can also just smaller clubs 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.690
 so if you are faster you can do it 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.489
 I know now that I am there 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.219
 somehow just what do I need 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.629
 knows that it happens there and see it here 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.719
 we also directly in the 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:58.079
 right description share button above 

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:59.190
 around the controller on the left because all know 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.600
 next you could choose 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.520
 Now I want to take a snapshot of 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.290
 where i said off or a video clip 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.850
 of course we have that now 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.350
 videoclip accepted because we of course 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.549
 want to show it all a bit like 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.549
 you cut that together too 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.130
 so we want the whole course 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:17.940
 small wait still work water 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.710
 but then it will be us too now 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:21.330
 explains ok how does it work 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.340
 but also explain itself as we do 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.810
 Immediately see left shoulder button here 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.860
 start right shoulder that he is on it 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.479
 Listen and with the stick of course 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.030
 choose from where to where you just that 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.930
 whole evenings or abo what is important 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.759
 that you also in others 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.170
 can adjust intervals from 1 to 60 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.940
 Seconds is pretty much everything in it 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.920
 Unfortunately, it is not quite so 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:41.509
 just like the xbox movie 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.509
 Dark in the point definitely to the xbox 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:53.009
 is so short 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.450
 and then you can rename it I was 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.780
 not sure how to name it 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.939
 I should actually want it first 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.130
 beer assassins end and the new one 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:03.960
 character in assassin's creed 4 is yes 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.270
 actually an assassin and a pirate 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.259
 so much assassin but somehow 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.369
 his colleague come on that the 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:10.259
 actually somehow templer, too 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.150
 that's why it really should be 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.440
 come on peters assembler but 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.690
 also peter myself I did not come 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.200
 that's why hammers as pazzini next to it 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.200
 calmly 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.459
 That's the way to confirm a name 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.829
 you still watch who you share the whole 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:33.359
 On facebook you have to be completely honest 

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:36.150
 to be there I finds cool on that one 

00:02:33.359 --> 00:02:37.439
 facebook posts because social networks 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.250
 It should not be better anyway 

00:02:37.439 --> 00:02:41.340
 to include 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:43.379
 conclusion , I can only say on 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.930
 the ps4 works is essential 

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:47.549
 easier for me felt the whole 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.959
 record and then just divide 

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:51.739
 also that you share on facebook 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:51.739
 can is great
