you you kind of leave 17 story crazy

00:06:16.419 --> 00:06:18.089 
you you kind of leave 17 story crazy
store<00:06:16.810> and<00:06:16.840> there's<00:06:17.289> another<00:06:17.530> one<00:06:17.740> right<00:06:17.770> next

to<00:06:18.250> it<00:06:18.340> so<00:06:18.699> it's<00:06:19.150> it's<00:06:19.419> pretty<00:06:19.599> jam-packed<00:06:20.169> I

00:06:20.309 --> 00:06:20.319 
to it so it's it's pretty jam-packed I

00:06:20.319 --> 00:06:23.189 
to it so it's it's pretty jam-packed I
think<00:06:20.500> it's<00:06:20.650> like<00:06:21.120> you<00:06:22.120> know<00:06:22.240> five<00:06:22.630> blocks

00:06:23.189 --> 00:06:23.199 
think it's like you know five blocks

00:06:23.199 --> 00:06:25.620 
think it's like you know five blocks
across<00:06:23.380> or<00:06:23.770> something<00:06:24.069> like<00:06:24.190> that<00:06:24.250> so<00:06:25.180> you

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:25.630 
across or something like that so you

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:27.180 
across or something like that so you
could<00:06:25.750> walk<00:06:25.960> from<00:06:26.440> end<00:06:26.620> to<00:06:26.650> end<00:06:26.740> everything

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:27.190 
could walk from end to end everything

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:29.879 
could walk from end to end everything
it's<00:06:27.430> not<00:06:27.550> like<00:06:27.669> an<00:06:27.789> entire<00:06:28.479> city<00:06:28.810> but<00:06:29.560> it's

00:06:29.879 --> 00:06:29.889
