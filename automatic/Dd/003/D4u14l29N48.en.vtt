00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:09.559
 I am being going to teach how 

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:12.110
 how does the dog install and it's the least 

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:15.100
 we have to get into the forum and 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:15.100
 before we get 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:20.150
 so that I am starting from scratch as 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:21.350
 if I had nothing less 12 2012 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:23.630
 discharge 

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:26.450
 mp complete and it will not measure and two with 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:28.610
 download gp hunger and it drops directly 

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:30.800
 then the trap of this link or this one and 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:32.629
 the trackpad 2 of this book of this what 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.790
 same then the patch so it's not the 

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:36.470
 of re closely also this one unloads it 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:40.490
 of half a row and then the patch to 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:42.380
 say that these cases are here worth 

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:43.880
 once this is done what you have to 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:47.350
 do the following after downloaded 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:47.350
 you go to the folder 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:54.150
 go to the download folder and a country 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:01:03.340
 or they will leave a factor that some of them 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:01:07.720
 is to copy it brings them inside the 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:09.760
 agreement or is it sticks to the team where 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:12.070
 have and the game installed 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:16.410
 and what is here right click here 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:20.200
 it is replaced by this factor 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:22.360
 then after if you have to be in 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.950
 the other that puts of plugin plugin that 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:26.530
 this is what some have to do 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:28.180
 Double click installation does not extract 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:30.160
 Normally the trailers there are double click 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:33.300
 how do you want installation normally 

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:33.300
 is the other one is glue cut 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:41.200
 correctly read the traps and these 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:46.710
 two milestones the only thing you have to do 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:46.710
 is the following you do not have that the x 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:53.790
 what it seems to me that was what 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.980
 I'll put somewhere if you do not have 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.810
 in front of what you download from some 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:58.980
 side of equipales be there 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.500
 simply normal where it is 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:04.020
 interned there is x part I have x 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.440
 for it rises 5 points 2 is called new v 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:12.210
 5.2 good 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:14.670
 niu ni ni ni for example and another is what 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:16.860
 you have to do is assign the button of the 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:19.010
 Kers think it over before assigning them 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.409
 you are going here 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:25.510
 where I wanted to assign clear if not 

00:02:21.409 --> 00:02:25.510
 I wanted in a guy 

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:32.239
 on the buttons you have to hit the button 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.879
 does anyone do for example I use 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:36.650
 this is the same take a point in 

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:39.280
 five and as you see 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.280
 this is the kers 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:47.870
 so that it looks like taking us for that 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:49.090
 only one button this is assigned and once 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:51.430
 simulated 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:53.690
 It has been done 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:55.910
 here the button I have the photo bet 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:58.690
 because I already have it on but it 's walking 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:58.690
 blank the letter 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:04.840
 and assigned the boots the j 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:07.680
 when sometimes the drops like here are 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:10.720
 will close only and the only one you have to do 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:13.190
 Here, no profile will come out 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:18.370
 you give new 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:18.370
 and then he already knows how to save and also 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:27.160
 this always when you minimize it like this and you 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:27.160
 will always be here 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:31.940
 right and klose 

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:33.050
 good 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:35.990
 once you have the assigned position 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:39.190
 fact you have to go to the effect in the 

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:39.190
 return to change the following 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:50.150
 start 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:56.220
 the option 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:59.580
 setting 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:02.540
 they control here in squares and the only thing 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:02.540
 that you have to do the following 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:07.079
 find 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:10.390
 and here is the music 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:16.720
 controls where it puts 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:19.030
 temporary turbo you have to assign the 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:21.190
 Kers key, either the command or the 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:23.229
 steering wheel what you have worth 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:25.120
 they do not have to finish what the x for the 

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:26.080
 x to have to stop the drops always 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.690
 where do you want 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:30.220
 because that is to make it look more than 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:31.600
 agreement here you have to assign here 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:33.400
 store more than the buttons on the remote 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:35.290
 of the flyer of what you are going to use or 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:38.889
 I have others for me I have already put 

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:40.840
 my vote that the case of my motorcycle where 

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:42.850
 left the command to be here flyer 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:45.280
 for being a flyer after putting on your button 

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:47.970
 to trace how I repeat or go down more 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:47.970
 low that puts 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:54.320
 where he puts headlights always below is 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:55.520
 leave the beach because where it puts the 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:59.810
 handbrake beneath the 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:05:02.870
 always brake, then there you have to 

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:04.490
 Kings assign the button and button 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:06.740
 Casey of our command of our command 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:10.400
 do not want it so there is no handbrake 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:12.680
 of beef and assigns it jce and it's already 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:13.960
 ready everything to start playing in 

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:17.240
 testing 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:19.820
 online on our server now 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:22.210
 everything works check it and you will see how 

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:22.210
 works
