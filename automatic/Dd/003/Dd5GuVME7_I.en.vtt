that way now let's go ahead and dry fit
on<00:01:28.500> our<00:01:28.590> Spiro<00:01:29.180> let's<00:01:30.180> line<00:01:30.540> it<00:01:30.570> back<00:01:30.869> up<00:01:31.140> so

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
on our Spiro let's line it back up so

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.030 
on our Spiro let's line it back up so
our<00:01:32.159> Spiro<00:01:32.490> will<00:01:32.700> indeed<00:01:33.030> fit<00:01:33.330> in<00:01:33.479> there<00:01:34.040> now
