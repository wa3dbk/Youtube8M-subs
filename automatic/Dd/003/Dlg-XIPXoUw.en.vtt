00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
year and it's really making me doubt how

year and it's really making me doubt how
accurate<00:00:55.800> it<00:00:55.890> can<00:00:55.920> be<00:00:56.219> when<00:00:56.579> we<00:00:56.730> see<00:00:57.030> things

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
accurate it can be when we see things

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.389 
accurate it can be when we see things
like<00:00:57.480> this<00:00:57.840> happen<00:00:58.199> this<00:00:58.289> is<00:00:58.350> Adrian<00:00:58.890> Peterson

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
just for clarity he runs up to an

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.979 
just for clarity he runs up to an
interaction<00:01:02.129> between<00:01:02.340> a<00:01:02.730> linebacker<00:01:03.090> and<00:01:03.690> an

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
interaction between a linebacker and an

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.420 
interaction between a linebacker and an
offensive<00:01:04.439> lineman<00:01:04.710> and<00:01:04.920> you<00:01:05.010> can<00:01:05.129> see<00:01:05.280> he

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
offensive lineman and you can see he

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.640 
offensive lineman and you can see he
starts<00:01:05.850> to<00:01:06.030> leave<00:01:06.270> his<00:01:06.450> feet<00:01:06.659> and<00:01:06.900> leap<00:01:07.500> into

the<00:01:07.799> air<00:01:07.890> and<00:01:08.390> then<00:01:09.390> he<00:01:09.420> kind<00:01:09.750> of<00:01:09.810> gets<00:01:09.990> locked

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
the air and then he kind of gets locked

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.210 
the air and then he kind of gets locked
up<00:01:11.130> in<00:01:11.490> between<00:01:11.760> them<00:01:12.060> and<00:01:12.650> then<00:01:13.650> he's<00:01:13.860> able<00:01:14.010> to

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
up in between them and then he's able to

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.300 
up in between them and then he's able to
continue<00:01:14.760> through<00:01:15.270> and<00:01:15.540> over<00:01:16.170> the<00:01:17.070> linebacker

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
continue through and over the linebacker

as<00:01:17.880> they<00:01:18.270> both<00:01:18.540> fall<00:01:18.900> and<00:01:19.229> then<00:01:20.159> I<00:01:20.189> mean<00:01:20.520> right

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
as they both fall and then I mean right

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.990 
as they both fall and then I mean right

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
here it's pretty easy to understand

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.690 
here it's pretty easy to understand
if<00:01:24.140> every<00:01:25.140> step<00:01:25.439> is<00:01:25.619> being<00:01:25.860> calculated<00:01:26.280> on<00:01:26.670> the

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
if every step is being calculated on the

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.580 
if every step is being calculated on the
fly<00:01:27.000> and<00:01:27.330> matters<00:01:27.689> and<00:01:27.869> must<00:01:28.049> mean<00:01:28.290> something

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
fly and matters and must mean something
