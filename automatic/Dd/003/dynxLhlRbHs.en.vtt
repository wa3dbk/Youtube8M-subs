00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:18.240
 px is a scooter that we are now 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.220
 launching in Brazil already nationalized or 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.140
 be produced in manaus 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.330
 but it is a model that already does enough 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.820
 success outside in europe 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.820
 here in brazil he comes to complete the 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:32.009
 our reign of tapping and with this chip 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.880
 larger displacement greater performance with 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.930
 power 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:40.610
 we hope to strengthen and 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:43.890
 expand the market base dispute 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:46.559
 in the future we will have one in the 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.410
 more models and larger displacements 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:52.649
 our pcx it brings an unprecedented system 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:55.949
 for Brazil, which is a system that helps 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.899
 to save fuel and lower 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.800
 emission level of polluting gases 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:04.199
 this system is called haidÃª a stop 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:07.619
 or very well known in the market 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:10.890
 world of cars such as start stop 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:14.490
 that is when you are idling 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.080
 for example stopped at the lighthouse is more than 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.380
 three seconds the engine literally 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:22.140
 off and the time you need 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:25.140
 start the headlight with a 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.700
 accelerator it automatically restarts 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.159
 so it 's a very ingenious system 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:33.119
 which involves the electronic mechanical part 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:35.790
 and makes the operation be 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:38.100
 extremely fast and imperceptible to 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.979
 another revolutionary system we are not 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:44.640
 bringing the vision of saving is as if 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.600
 saw download pollutants is ips system 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.920
 works together with the broadcast 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.479
 automatic 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.329
 so when you hit for example a 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.110
 constant speed 60 and 80 kilometers 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:54.420
 per hour 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:57.360
 it's a you do not have acceleration you just 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.549
 have to keep constant speed 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.520
 he understands that you are in a situation 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:04.009
 where it can vary 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:06.170
 the relation elongate this relation is 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:08.509
 decrease the engine speed by keeping the 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:10.399
 speed saving fuel to 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:12.140
 another item that is worth being drawn in 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:15.170
 security is the system of 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.129
 combined brakes are you have two 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:17.750
 levers 

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:21.590
 the right hand brake normally 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:23.480
 front ok and on the left than on motorbikes 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:26.930
 A clutch is used 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:30.049
 in the case of both the handle and the px is a 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:32.239
 combined brake where you tighten the 

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:34.069
 you brake the rear wheel in 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:36.079
 with the front wheel or the 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:40.099
 rear brake is never to drive alone 

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:42.040
 in 13.6 horsepower a power 

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:45.170
 that causes him to have 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:47.420
 enough breath for sustained climb 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:49.970
 at 90 to 100 kilometers per hour in 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:53.690
 straight and down the next 120 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:54.829
 the highlight for pc x is yours 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:57.680
 price 

00:02:54.829 --> 00:03:02.209
 How are we doing there anyway? 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:05.090
 strong a strong amount of flying one 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:08.299
 strong volume and better design to attack 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:11.329
 the market is our intention is 

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:13.250
 to market another thousand units per month 

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:16.069
 and for that we come with a price 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:18.410
 very competitive price is 7 thousand 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:20.180
 nine hundred and ninety reais 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:21.350
 in early May begin to be 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:25.489
 distributed the first units 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:28.970
 arrive to go to your website and until the day 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:33.310
 May 20 we already have the network 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:33.310
 well-stocked with this model
