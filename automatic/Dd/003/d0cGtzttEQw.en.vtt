 Congolese as well as Flemish so I 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.880
 had these magnificent original by the fact 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.019
 of an adoption by two Japanese of whom one 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.120
 can see it anyway that I am very 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.989
 very bridled here and I have hair 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.480

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.370
 look at a hair dryer nothing good its 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.710
 hair can be seen that it's 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.540
 100% bape just like an african I 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.250
 hair very very frizzy type 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.450
 that is, you did not do it at all 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.890
 way before my hair finally 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.239
 it's always a hassle in the morning but good 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.829
 we will say that now it's going a little 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.480
 better since straightening 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.550
 but does not prevent it always remains a type 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.370
 very very crappy hair over his 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:59.010
 debt blond be a young blonde in a 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.210
 family of Africans this is very 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.309
 very fishy anyway it must be said 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.390
 here we can say when left 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.820
 still the renois they have the most 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:08.939
 of class one can say it anyway that 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.979
 it's all in this rap 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.299
 and his friends will do all that is music 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.700
 we can see michael jackson 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:16.500
 after there there are number of ad 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.759
 infinite but we still have to say it 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.020
 the coming there are still more than 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.549
 class here so when I say by 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:24.659
 example that I have Flemish origins 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:27.450
 there it goes nickel against the fact of 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.159
 to say that I am African soul there his 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.009
 share down shot will of course 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.329
 after all so the racist taste mm us 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.689
 look at seven at everything recently 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:43.020
 no ah if it's okay it comes from your house 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:44.100
 it's good you saw it's your father and say 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.689
 and as soon as we try to rebel 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.570
 drop from in bye like that 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:50.070
 yeah that's the Africans 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.450
 he takes himself a little bit at the judges have 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.159
 took a little too much confidence is 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.130
 everything and after the person who accepts 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:58.200
 but more or less what it depends on 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.990
 you you african bah yeah i 'm africa 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.530
 a theme of the African stadiums word 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.110
 Chinese 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:07.220
 ok you little month after by the size of 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.220
 his penis is in front of a little less 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.740
 I do not understand the fact that I am told 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:18.940
 that Africans are poor by 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:20.860
 report to all the resources that we 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:23.710
 bring in all that is black gold 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:25.330
 all that is gold diamonds all 

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:26.920
 resources that come most from there 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:28.720
 how can we say that africa is 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.490
 poor is anything 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.830
 I personally have always been in 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:34.480
 contact with renault so I have 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:36.970
 always used I said to myself 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.780
 not that there were different alleys 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:39.580
 colors etc 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.800
 I saw myself as do not see 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:44.500
 of some we will say race like 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:46.510
 would say the others but hey we'll say 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:49.600
 that I lead a bit of a double life because 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:53.140
 that on one side I live and with my mother 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:54.970
 on the rather African side and on the side of 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:57.820
 my father who is rather white so must 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:03:00.220
 go on the Flemish side what so that brings 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:02.140
 a little bit of a double life there is a 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.790
 little bit good we will say that there will be 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:05.080
 a lot more atmosphere in a 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:07.090
 African family only in a family 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:08.920
