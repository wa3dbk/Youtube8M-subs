00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:29.500 
dickin now if you add the oil too fast

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.450 
dickin now if you add the oil too fast
the<00:01:30.400> egg<00:01:30.850> will<00:01:31.119> not<00:01:31.330> bind<00:01:31.780> to<00:01:32.140> the<00:01:32.229> oil<00:01:32.290> and<00:01:32.680> all

remain<00:01:34.210> separated<00:01:34.690> and<00:01:35.440> you<00:01:35.740> won't<00:01:35.920> get<00:01:36.100> a

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:36.250 
remain separated and you won't get a

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:39.210

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:41.170 
very importantly add slowly it will take

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:43.530 
very importantly add slowly it will take
some<00:01:41.350> time<00:01:41.410> but<00:01:42.070> the<00:01:42.400> results<00:01:42.820> will<00:01:42.970> be<00:01:43.210> worth

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:43.540 
some time but the results will be worth

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:47.550 
some time but the results will be worth
it<00:01:43.720> in<00:01:43.810> the<00:01:43.840> end<00:01:43.930> us<00:01:45.630> by<00:01:46.630> now<00:01:46.960> your<00:01:47.170> forearm

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:08.710 
little bit more and each time just

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:11.070 
little bit more and each time just
making<00:02:09.069> sure<00:02:09.100> that<00:02:09.490> you<00:02:09.729> whisk<00:02:10.179> in<00:02:10.450> the<00:02:10.690> entire

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
making sure that you whisk in the entire

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:12.360 
making sure that you whisk in the entire
amount<00:02:11.170> of<00:02:11.380> work<00:02:11.590> before<00:02:11.770> you<00:02:11.920> add<00:02:12.069> some<00:02:12.250> more

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
amount of work before you add some more

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.760 
amount of work before you add some more
otherwise<00:02:13.300> do<00:02:13.600> you<00:02:13.690> may<00:02:14.080> still<00:02:14.350> run<00:02:14.530> the<00:02:14.620> risk

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:14.770 
otherwise do you may still run the risk

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:17.010 
otherwise do you may still run the risk
of<00:02:14.980> the<00:02:15.670> egg<00:02:15.850> separating<00:02:16.330> from<00:02:16.420> the<00:02:16.510> oil<00:02:16.750> and

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:17.020 
of the egg separating from the oil and

of course
so<00:02:50.740> let's<00:02:50.920> take<00:02:51.040> that<00:02:51.190> an<00:02:51.340> end<00:02:51.640> we're<00:02:51.940> going<00:02:52.060> to

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
so let's take that an end we're going to

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.140 
so let's take that an end we're going to
also<00:02:52.360> stick<00:02:52.750> in<00:02:52.930> about<00:02:53.620> a<00:02:53.860> tablespoon<00:02:54.580> of

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
also stick in about a tablespoon of

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.210 
also stick in about a tablespoon of
vinegar<00:02:55.330> this<00:02:56.080> will<00:02:56.230> help<00:02:56.350> Pierce<00:02:56.950> all<00:02:57.130> the

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220 
vinegar this will help Pierce all the

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:58.740 
vinegar this will help Pierce all the
flavors<00:02:57.610> and<00:02:57.640> bring<00:02:58.030> it<00:02:58.150> all<00:02:58.240> together<00:02:58.390> at<00:02:58.660> the

flavors and bring it all together at the

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.650 
flavors and bring it all together at the
same<00:02:58.870> time<00:02:59.140> so<00:02:59.550> that<00:03:00.550> would<00:03:00.640> be<00:03:00.760> wonderful<00:03:01.240> and

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
same time so that would be wonderful and

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:04.740 
same time so that would be wonderful and
