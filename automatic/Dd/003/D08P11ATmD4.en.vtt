00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.259
 if the truth is that I am half 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.150
 romantic novel writer does not matter 

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:26.970
 that it is medieval chiclÃ­n genre or 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.289
 erotic has always interested me why 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.869
 because my mother is a very big 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.579
 romantic novel reader I started to 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.140
 read what she read and good always 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.550
 I said if I ever wrote a book I was going 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.550
 to be romantic and like to see well 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.370
 man totally nothing else you have to 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.560
 see me I have done I think that reflex 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.270
 a little the character that I have in my 

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:53.550
 novels precisely because women 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.140
 in day we no longer have the character its 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.780
 habit that women had the women of 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.360
 20 or 40 years ago each generation goes 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.760
 changing and it is progressing a lot and 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:04.229
 I think that women today 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:08.210
 we know very well what we want what 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.210
 we look for and what we want to achieve 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.960
 we are in need of strong emotions 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.790
 soft little soft and strong 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.040
 of the matter is that when you read a 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:26.400
 book surprise you in this case the 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:28.020
 erotic is is a style that has been 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.909
 written and you have always read what 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.190
 happens is that well I am aware that 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.050
 in this life everything goes by fashions some 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:35.909
 years with vampire fashion now 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:37.820
 is the fashion of erotic then 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:40.080
 we are not in need of what we 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:44.630
 hook it does not matter if it's erotic 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.630
 they love but they are strawberry cupcake 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:51.100
 both things also as a weapon is very 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:52.930
 well and as a defense also everything has to be 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:54.400
 know how to use it at the time but 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:56.170
 good for me the best sex is for 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:59.250
 have fun my defense weapon to the best 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:59.250
 it's for fun and point 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.909
 and that we do not go hopefully I would sell 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.650
 so many novels as sold with 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:09.650
 logically integrated 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:14.780
 the second evolving at the hands of 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:16.069
 type of novel of corÃ­n tellado does not have 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.200
 nothing to do with mine the only thing that 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:20.090
 has to see is that they are relationships 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.819
 of the people hers in his time 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.620
 and mine in my current time but let's go 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:26.359
 It's a great honor, I hope I already have 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.840
 bless so much and be so well known 

00:02:26.359 --> 00:02:28.840
 like corin tellado 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.720
 Because within the culture there 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:40.530
 lot in worship and many times people 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:42.150
 that is more cultured is the one that crosses this 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:44.190
 type of novel or the kind of genre that 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.410
 I write as something that is second or 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:48.360
 third category when they are not very 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:50.069
 wrong the romantic novel is a 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.989
 thing that has been read a lot is going to be read 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:54.330
 and he is always given what happens is that 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:56.519
 well I always compare when they tell me 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:58.049
 you who write and I say no I know writer 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:03.870
 of romantic novel not then much 

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:06.170
 people encourage people from the culturetas 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:08.640
 who think that what I write does not 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:10.349
 It's good for nothing and it's very useful 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.030
 more than what people believe and also 

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:14.010
 I'm doing one thing a book of 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:16.230
 thriller a fantasy book a book 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:20.010
 of romantic all have a beginning and 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:22.440
 an ending is now now it is here every 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:24.780
 one read what he likes without underestimating 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:27.349
 what the other person simply does 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.349
 is respected 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.520
 so that they believe what they are doing to 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:40.350
 that others believe in him cost me 

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:42.480
 fifteen years that someone believed in me 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:44.910
 but as I believed in myself I said one 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.620
 Well someday someday I will publish and 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:48.150
 good they had to spend fifteen years 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:49.980
 receive many is not from the 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:51.750
 editorials but in the end I got it 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:53.010
 but mainly because he does not have the 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:54.630
 actuary because he believed in what I 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:56.520
 I was doing then my advice is 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:58.730
 who believes in him so that others create 

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:58.730
 at 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:07.530
 because you live with immense joy and 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:08.879
 with much gratitude to my readers to my 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:10.799
 readers and especially my warriors 

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:14.099
 which are the ones that are getting 

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:15.689
 my novels go as they go is not something 

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:16.680
 that I enjoy a lot I really enjoy 

00:04:15.689 --> 00:04:18.900
 all because of what I said in previous 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:21.120
 question have been so many years 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:22.919
 trying and they told me not because 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:24.600
 the female characters that I created 

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:25.860
 they had so much strength that they said that 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:27.690
 he has to change them and I refused to 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:30.030
 change them then at the end my 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:32.190
 female characters at the end are 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:34.740
 giving what I wanted are liking and 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:37.350
 they are making me the most 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:38.850
 read and bought in 2013 and I 'm 

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:42.260
 happy but above all I already tell you 

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:44.120
 gratitude what I have to give and 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.530
 is that I do not know what to say about this 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:47.810
 question because it is a pass 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:51.520
 think that nobody wanted to publish you 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:51.520
 be the best sold so imagine
