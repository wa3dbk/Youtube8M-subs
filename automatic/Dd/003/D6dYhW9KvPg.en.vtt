I will sit in the open that they

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:19.710 
I will sit in the open that they
mentioned<00:05:18.550> the<00:05:18.610> fact<00:05:18.730> that<00:05:18.820> Valve<00:05:19.090> took<00:05:19.300> 24

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:19.720 
mentioned the fact that Valve took 24

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:21.270 
mentioned the fact that Valve took 24
hours<00:05:19.900> to<00:05:20.050> part<00:05:20.260> two<00:05:20.620> patch<00:05:20.890> out<00:05:21.100> the

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:21.280 
hours to part two patch out the

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:24.030 
hours to part two patch out the
heartbleed<00:05:21.760> but<00:05:22.720> which<00:05:23.560> came<00:05:23.830> out<00:05:23.919> a<00:05:23.980> few

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:24.040 
heartbleed but which came out a few

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:26.909 
heartbleed but which came out a few
months<00:05:24.220> ago<00:05:24.510> so<00:05:25.510> hard<00:05:25.960> lead<00:05:26.169> was<00:05:26.350> an<00:05:26.500> issue

00:05:26.909 --> 00:05:26.919 
months ago so hard lead was an issue

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:28.920 
months ago so hard lead was an issue
with<00:05:27.070> openssl<00:05:27.520> where<00:05:28.360> someone<00:05:28.840> could

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:28.930 
with openssl where someone could

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:31.260 
with openssl where someone could
basically<00:05:29.110> send<00:05:29.560> data<00:05:29.740> to<00:05:30.070> serve<00:05:30.880> and<00:05:31.060> get<00:05:31.210> the

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:31.270 
basically send data to serve and get the

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:32.750 
basically send data to serve and get the
server<00:05:31.480> to<00:05:31.660> repeat<00:05:31.990> you

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:32.760 
server to repeat you

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:35.600 
server to repeat you
a<00:05:32.820> lot<00:05:33.630> more<00:05:33.900> data<00:05:34.140> from<00:05:34.800> previous<00:05:34.950> sessions

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:35.610 
a lot more data from previous sessions

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:37.370 
a lot more data from previous sessions
so<00:05:36.210> that<00:05:36.240> you<00:05:36.420> can<00:05:36.570> basically<00:05:36.750> get<00:05:37.080> people

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:37.380 
so that you can basically get people

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:39.200 
so that you can basically get people
session<00:05:37.740> logs<00:05:38.220> and<00:05:38.430> ID<00:05:38.550> and<00:05:38.820> passwords<00:05:39.150> and

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:17.520 
pretty much after I've done this video

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:20.450 
pretty much after I've done this video
just<00:06:18.300> in<00:06:18.510> case<00:06:18.770> but<00:06:19.770> it's<00:06:19.890> a<00:06:19.950> bit<00:06:20.100> worrying

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:20.460 
just in case but it's a bit worrying

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:21.980 
just in case but it's a bit worrying
valve<00:06:20.790> haven't<00:06:21.180> either<00:06:21.300> disclosed<00:06:21.750> that<00:06:21.870> I

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:21.990 
valve haven't either disclosed that I

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:23.240 
valve haven't either disclosed that I
haven't<00:06:22.260> told<00:06:22.410> people<00:06:22.740> to<00:06:22.770> change<00:06:23.160> their

haven't told people to change their

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:24.470 
haven't told people to change their
password<00:06:23.700> which<00:06:23.850> is<00:06:24.000> you<00:06:24.120> know<00:06:24.150> common

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:24.480 
password which is you know common

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:26.600 
password which is you know common
practice<00:06:24.720> after<00:06:25.020> as<00:06:25.410> you<00:06:25.590> like<00:06:25.740> this<00:06:25.890> it

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:26.610 
practice after as you like this it

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:28.820 
practice after as you like this it
whether<00:06:27.540> it's<00:06:27.750> important<00:06:28.200> or<00:06:28.320> not<00:06:28.440> whether

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:28.830 
whether it's important or not whether

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:30.410 
whether it's important or not whether
some<00:06:29.100> has<00:06:29.250> actually<00:06:29.550> you<00:06:29.820> know<00:06:29.910> got<00:06:30.240> hold<00:06:30.390> of

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:30.420 
some has actually you know got hold of

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:32.180 
some has actually you know got hold of
data<00:06:30.600> or<00:06:30.720> not<00:06:30.960> just<00:06:31.440> to<00:06:31.560> make<00:06:31.710> sure<00:06:31.740> people

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:32.190 
data or not just to make sure people

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:33.920 
data or not just to make sure people
change<00:06:32.820> passwords<00:06:33.120> mean<00:06:33.390> that's<00:06:33.690> the

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:33.930 
change passwords mean that's the

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:35.860 
change passwords mean that's the
sensible<00:06:34.200> option<00:06:34.410> there<00:06:34.800> is<00:06:34.920> no<00:06:35.040> loss<00:06:35.310> there

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:35.870 
sensible option there is no loss there

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:38.810 
sensible option there is no loss there
so<00:06:36.870> it's<00:06:37.020> a<00:06:37.080> bit<00:06:37.260> iffy<00:06:37.560> the<00:06:37.710> valve<00:06:37.980> failed<00:06:38.640> to

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:38.820 
so it's a bit iffy the valve failed to

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:40.340 
so it's a bit iffy the valve failed to
do<00:06:38.910> that<00:06:38.940> and<00:06:39.360> I<00:06:39.450> valve<00:06:39.660> responded<00:06:40.200> and<00:06:40.290> said

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:40.350 
do that and I valve responded and said

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:41.900 
do that and I valve responded and said
okay<00:06:40.830> well<00:06:41.010> you<00:06:41.160> know<00:06:41.220> escapes<00:06:41.520> important<00:06:41.850> to

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:41.910 
okay well you know escapes important to

00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:45.230 
okay well you know escapes important to
us<00:06:42.030> well<00:06:43.020> have<00:06:43.170> set<00:06:43.350> up<00:06:43.530> a<00:06:43.650> page<00:06:44.610> off<00:06:44.940> of<00:06:45.090> their

00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:45.240 
us well have set up a page off of their
