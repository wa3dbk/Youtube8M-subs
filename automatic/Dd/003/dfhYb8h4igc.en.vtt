00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:53.870 
you what they look like I haven't really
decided<00:01:52.770> if<00:01:53.009> I'm<00:01:53.100> going<00:01:53.189> to<00:01:53.280> wear<00:01:53.399> them<00:01:53.640> on<00:01:53.759> the

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
decided if I'm going to wear them on the

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.030 
decided if I'm going to wear them on the
outside<00:01:54.360> or<00:01:54.570> the<00:01:54.600> inside<00:01:54.740> but<00:01:55.740> I<00:01:55.799> thought

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
outside or the inside but I thought

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.969 
outside or the inside but I thought
these<00:01:56.219> were<00:01:56.399> just<00:01:56.610> the<00:01:56.939> cutest<00:01:57.540> thing

00:01:57.969 --> 00:01:57.979 
these were just the cutest thing

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:00.109 
these were just the cutest thing
considering<00:01:58.979> there<00:01:59.130> be<00:01:59.310> four<00:01:59.520> dollars<00:01:59.670> and

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
considering there be four dollars and

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.719 
considering there be four dollars and
they<00:02:00.630> are<00:02:00.810> a<00:02:00.840> half<00:02:01.590> size<00:02:01.619> too<00:02:01.920> big<00:02:02.310> but<00:02:02.670> i

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
they are a half size too big but i

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.310 
they are a half size too big but i
figured<00:02:03.060> i<00:02:03.119> could<00:02:03.149> wear<00:02:03.390> these<00:02:03.540> and<00:02:03.719> socks<00:02:03.990> and

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
figured i could wear these and socks and

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.700 
figured i could wear these and socks and
um<00:02:05.009> and<00:02:05.479> it<00:02:06.479> would<00:02:06.600> be<00:02:06.689> just<00:02:06.869> as<00:02:07.020> good<00:02:07.170> as<00:02:07.439> if<00:02:07.619> i

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
um and it would be just as good as if i

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.309
