00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:10.340
 at 18 years old and with nothing to lose, Luis 

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:12.080
 Rosendo Ramos Maldonado surprised 

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:13.610
 all by winning the gold medal in the 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:16.040
 San Cristóbal Pan-American Games 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:17.800
 venezuela both en route and in the 4000 

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:19.970
 meters in pursuit by teams 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.259
 I would repeat the feat two years later 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:23.390
 in the Pan American Games of Santo Domingo 

00:00:21.259 --> 00:00:25.489
 where I win in the 100 test 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:27.140
 kilometers against the clock by teams and 

00:00:25.489 --> 00:00:30.770
 got the third place in great depth 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:34.579
 individual for me I think that my 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:37.200
 specialty was more than all that of a 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:40.590
 classic runner 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:43.320
 that is really not me even if they continue in 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:46.010
 some laps or the laps are 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.840
 stage races of 12 or 15 10 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:50.730
 this continue in those competitions but 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.580
 I was more easily facilitated by a 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.809
 day two gold medals would be added in 

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:56.550
 his record of great fund in the 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.309
 Pan - American Games of Caracas 83 e 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.110
 indianápolis 87 in the latter also 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.930
 he won the bronze in 100 kilometers 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:05.729
 by teams since then no other 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.840
 Mexican has returned to the podium in 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.240
 the background race of the games 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.880
 Pan American 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:13.920
 previously in 1975 chendo as they say 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.140
 reached the national sub-championship in 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.759
 individual persecution but not even what 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.119
 included in the list of selected 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:22.800
 for the Olympians from Montreal 76 up 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.290
 who won the gold medal in venezuela 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:27.450
 secured the pass unfortunately in 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.369
 Montreal did not do well during the 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.229
 trainings sick of bronchitis by 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.000
 the variant of the weather and had to 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.430
 leave the race half competition 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.770
 the rider would participate in the games 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.500
 olympics of the 84 angels concluding 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.149
 position 16 and in the insurance 88 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.740
 as coach and team captain in 

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:45.360
 place 77 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.549
 currently runs his own school of 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.460
 cycling has been sports advisor 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:52.590
 coach and commentator is very popular 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.110
 among the people where they see him they shout 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.580
 chendo and take photos with him gladly 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:01.250
 to be next to a legend of 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:03.150
 Cycling in Mexico is having achieved 3 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:07.410
 22 gold medals in the games 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:09.869
 Pan-American Games of Caracas 83 e 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:14.130
 Indianapolis 87 in the big test 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:15.870
 fund in 76 win a championship 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:17.910
 pan-American route or in that 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.920
 so I think that right now there is another 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:21.780
 runner who has achieved it but I was 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:25.860
 the only one that has three championships 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:27.959
 route at the American level in 83 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.700
 have achieved the gold medal in 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:32.400
 Caracas gave me the national prize of the 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:35.340
 sport I went to three olympic games that 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:37.349
 it was montreal the angels and Seoul 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:40.769
 I was in the Pan-American games of 

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:43.270
