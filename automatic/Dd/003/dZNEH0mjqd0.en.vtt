is here is to get more space to your
guitar<00:01:06.640> for<00:01:07.640> the<00:01:07.700> course<00:01:07.940> here<00:01:08.180> I'm<00:01:08.300> using<00:01:08.450> th

00:01:08.889 --> 00:01:08.899 
guitar for the course here I'm using th

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:11.410 
guitar for the course here I'm using th
2's<00:01:09.259> wave<00:01:10.040> chorus<00:01:10.670> you<00:01:10.880> can<00:01:11.030> play<00:01:11.180> a<00:01:11.210> little

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:11.420 
2's wave chorus you can play a little

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:13.090 
2's wave chorus you can play a little
bit<00:01:11.630> with<00:01:11.810> the<00:01:11.930> band<00:01:12.200> width<00:01:12.470> of<00:01:12.710> the<00:01:12.830> course

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:13.100 
bit with the band width of the course

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:14.980 
bit with the band width of the course
which<00:01:13.399> is<00:01:13.430> going<00:01:13.759> to<00:01:13.850> enhance<00:01:14.240> the<00:01:14.570> modulation

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:14.990 
which is going to enhance the modulation

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:16.930 
which is going to enhance the modulation
of<00:01:15.320> the<00:01:15.500> effects<00:01:15.920> for<00:01:16.130> the<00:01:16.190> sound<00:01:16.490> i'm<00:01:16.610> using

of the effects for the sound i'm using
here<00:01:16.970> the<00:01:17.360> bandwidth<00:01:17.720> is<00:01:17.930> set<00:01:18.140> to<00:01:18.320> about<00:01:18.470> two

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:19.160 
here the bandwidth is set to about two

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.100 
here the bandwidth is set to about two
thirds<00:01:19.490> the<00:01:19.940> higher<00:01:20.119> the<00:01:20.300> bandwidth<00:01:20.660> the<00:01:20.899> more

thirds the higher the bandwidth the more

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:22.510 
thirds the higher the bandwidth the more
frequencies<00:01:21.710> are<00:01:21.830> going<00:01:21.979> to<00:01:22.039> come<00:01:22.190> out<00:01:22.340> of

frequencies are going to come out of

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.070 
frequencies are going to come out of
your<00:01:22.670> instruments<00:01:23.240> then<00:01:23.690> it<00:01:23.780> might<00:01:23.869> be

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:24.080 
your instruments then it might be

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:25.420 
your instruments then it might be
something<00:01:24.320> that<00:01:24.500> you<00:01:24.650> want<00:01:24.830> to<00:01:24.890> consider<00:01:25.250> if

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:25.430 
something that you want to consider if

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:27.789 
something that you want to consider if
your<00:01:25.610> instruments<00:01:26.270> bright<00:01:27.020> is<00:01:27.260> a<00:01:27.290> little<00:01:27.710> bit

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:27.799 
your instruments bright is a little bit

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:29.469 
your instruments bright is a little bit
lower<00:01:28.070> really<00:01:28.549> i'm<00:01:28.610> going<00:01:28.790> to<00:01:28.850> go<00:01:28.970> through<00:01:29.270> a

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:29.479 
lower really i'm going to go through a

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:31.570 
lower really i'm going to go through a
reverb<00:01:29.960> reverb<00:01:30.619> is<00:01:30.950> going<00:01:31.130> to<00:01:31.190> give<00:01:31.369> more

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:31.580 
reverb reverb is going to give more

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:40.360 
reverb reverb is going to give more
space<00:01:31.790> to<00:01:32.000> your<00:01:32.330> mix

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:40.370 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:43.160 

for<00:01:41.370> this<00:01:41.520> I'm<00:01:41.760> using<00:01:41.940> a<00:01:42.120> plate<00:01:42.420> reverb<00:01:42.690> the

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
for this I'm using a plate reverb the

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.570 
for this I'm using a plate reverb the
plate<00:01:43.380> reverb<00:01:43.560> is<00:01:43.830> going<00:01:44.040> to<00:01:44.100> spread<00:01:44.400> the

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:44.580 
plate reverb is going to spread the

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:46.430 
plate reverb is going to spread the
attack<00:01:44.940> of<00:01:45.150> the<00:01:45.240> notes<00:01:45.510> more<00:01:45.840> naturally

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:46.440 
attack of the notes more naturally

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.980 
attack of the notes more naturally
giving<00:01:47.100> you<00:01:47.250> a<00:01:47.280> smoother<00:01:47.910> sound<00:01:48.210> more<00:01:48.540> natural

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
giving you a smoother sound more natural

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.660 
giving you a smoother sound more natural
sound<00:01:49.290> which<00:01:49.470> is<00:01:49.650> what<00:01:50.190> we're<00:01:50.340> looking<00:01:50.640> for

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
sound which is what we're looking for

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.760 
sound which is what we're looking for
for<00:01:51.150> acoustic<00:01:51.660> instruments<00:01:52.230> after<00:01:52.620> these

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
for acoustic instruments after these

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.410 
for acoustic instruments after these
three<00:01:52.980> effects<00:01:53.490> you<00:01:53.580> might<00:01:53.850> want<00:01:54.060> to<00:01:54.150> consider

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
three effects you might want to consider

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.770 
three effects you might want to consider
adding<00:01:54.720> a<00:01:54.900> digital<00:01:55.350> delay<00:01:55.680> which<00:01:56.010> is<00:01:56.220> gonna

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
adding a digital delay which is gonna

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:05.200 
adding a digital delay which is gonna
personalize<00:01:57.780> your<00:01:57.810> sound<00:01:58.200> a<00:01:58.320> little<00:01:58.470> bit<00:01:58.680> more

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.210 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:07.610 

be<00:02:06.210> careful<00:02:06.660> when<00:02:06.840> playing<00:02:07.080> with<00:02:07.260> the<00:02:07.350> delay

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:07.620 
be careful when playing with the delay

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:09.350 
be careful when playing with the delay
you<00:02:08.040> still<00:02:08.310> want<00:02:08.490> your<00:02:08.580> instrument<00:02:09.030> to<00:02:09.119> sound

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
you still want your instrument to sound

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.620 
you still want your instrument to sound
natural<00:02:09.570> too<00:02:10.350> much<00:02:10.590> delay<00:02:10.890> might<00:02:11.880> make<00:02:12.450> your

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
natural too much delay might make your

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:15.350 
natural too much delay might make your
guitar<00:02:12.930> sound<00:02:13.260> to<00:02:13.890> synthetic<00:02:14.280> and<00:02:14.880> kind<00:02:15.300> of

acoustic<00:02:17.400> instrument<00:02:18.180> you<00:02:18.750> want<00:02:19.020> the<00:02:19.260> tone<00:02:19.560> to

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
acoustic instrument you want the tone to

remain as pure as possible you might

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.080 
remain as pure as possible you might
need<00:02:22.080> to<00:02:22.140> effect<00:02:22.680> a<00:02:22.830> little<00:02:22.950> bit<00:02:23.220> the<00:02:23.490> mid<00:02:23.760> the

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
need to effect a little bit the mid the

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.180 
need to effect a little bit the mid the
highs<00:02:24.330> the<00:02:24.750> base<00:02:24.959> so<00:02:25.620> for<00:02:25.800> this<00:02:25.890> we're<00:02:26.100> going

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
highs the base so for this we're going

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.699 
highs the base so for this we're going
to<00:02:26.250> use<00:02:26.520> a<00:02:26.790> parametric<00:02:27.540> EQ<00:02:28.170> this<00:02:28.410> is<00:02:28.530> going<00:02:28.650> to

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
to use a parametric EQ this is going to

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:31.280 
to use a parametric EQ this is going to
help<00:02:28.920> you<00:02:29.250> maybe<00:02:29.580> remove<00:02:30.090> the<00:02:30.540> low<00:02:30.750> Rumble

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
help you maybe remove the low Rumble

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
acoustic instruments you can do that by

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:37.430 
acoustic instruments you can do that by
setting<00:02:35.010> a<00:02:35.250> high<00:02:35.490> pass<00:02:35.790> filter<00:02:36.300> at<00:02:36.600> about<00:02:37.020> 80

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:40.150 
means that we have to have a time factor

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:43.050 
means that we have to have a time factor
and<00:03:40.599> because<00:03:41.319> this<00:03:41.709> delay<00:03:42.069> is<00:03:42.099> used<00:03:42.459> really<00:03:42.849> to

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:43.060 
and because this delay is used really to

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:45.420 
and because this delay is used really to
widen<00:03:43.569> your<00:03:43.599> sound<00:03:44.049> you<00:03:44.680> want<00:03:44.860> to<00:03:44.980> set<00:03:45.190> the

widen your sound you want to set the

widen your sound you want to set the

be<00:03:47.470> tweaked<00:03:47.920> you<00:03:48.400> can<00:03:48.610> really<00:03:48.940> personalize
