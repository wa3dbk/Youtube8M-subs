00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:05.220
 no 

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:05.220
 and 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:17.650
 no it's neither routine nor scary 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:22.009
 it's exciting in a good way and 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:25.430
 basically this is what we are looking for 

00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:27.320
 want to when we're on a tour of 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:30.559
 live the greatest things the most 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:32.090
 nice things and and I must say that there 

00:00:30.559 --> 00:00:35.090
 since january we have in india 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.559
 and we play non-stop and we have arrived 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:39.500
 in a summer festival period where we 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:42.470
 has this chance to play in beds 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:43.760
 in pretty incredible places what is 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:46.400
 there today it's on the big stage 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.200
 of the paleo so we just can not wait in fact 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:55.160
 we do not have other questions anymore 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:57.280
 scary than what not even because 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:00.380
 that the disk itself is 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:03.610
 musically it is rather worn by 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:06.500
 something rhythmic enough rhythmic 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:09.159
 and precisely memo even the same ones 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:11.479
 most melancholy words are often 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:12.889
 wrapped in melodies a lot 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:16.939
 more dancing is much more produced 

00:01:12.889 --> 00:01:18.200
 so no there is no there is no search 

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:19.850
 of suffering on the contrary I am even 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.770
 rather very happy to live my music 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:24.979
 today how life on stage 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:26.319
 together it's pippa after for the 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:29.619
 writing period 

00:01:26.319 --> 00:01:31.459
 there is no reasoning upstream what 

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:32.869
 the words I write are those who 

00:01:31.459 --> 00:01:34.880
 come it's not what I'm going 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:36.259
 search by calculating how to go 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.380
 look for them because I'm sad and 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:40.700
 happy what I do not have I do not have 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:46.340
 had this reasoning in writing these ten 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:48.380
 what in the disc where there are some 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.329
 some refrains that are in English 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:52.490
 as if all I said in the 

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:54.229
 couple and previous synthesize 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:57.639
 become a bit universal what it was 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:59.630
 more but that too 

00:01:57.639 --> 00:02:02.179
 micky it's been a long time 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:04.249
 that has crossed the studio that is 

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:06.799
 know and that's when I wrote 

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:08.209
 this song I really wanted to 

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:08.959
 do this duet with her because of the 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:11.840
 song that I had written it was 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:14.150
 really an exchange and I knew that I 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:16.579
 had to share this song and his voice 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.870
 seemed obvious to me in fact so 

00:02:16.579 --> 00:02:18.770
 that's me it's been like that 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:21.070
 but 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:23.480
 wale balance between french english 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:31.340
 it's when it comes when it's there 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:34.610
 it's there but as I write this 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:36.110
 which inspires me what plunges me into 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:37.820
 teeth of the ideas I'll find 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:38.930
 was never really party music 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:42.740
 and even less that of my generation 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:45.670
 what are the things that I'm going to 

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:48.770
 see what in the cinema in the theater 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:50.060
 the words I use in my songs 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:53.480
 they are really based on my 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:55.370
 intimate personal memories I tell myself 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.600
 not like this text it is well written 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:58.580
 I'm interested I want to do 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.540
 I do not really have this reasoning 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:02.000
 there is really something very 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.730
 raw in my writing words is 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.900
 the same when I saw that I'm not 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:08.600
 musician in the sense that I do not know 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:11.240
 the solfeggio of the piano guitar has 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:14.480
 really in the ear but are looking for 

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:16.070
 it's a press search like like 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:18.080
 a dance step which is to say I 

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:20.090
 put my fingers on the keyboard I find 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:22.730
 sounds that is I find the following of 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:23.320
 it's like that and not two and when we 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:25.730
 is in the studio 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:28.070
 finally in the memories that I have 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:29.540
 with the guys when we're in the studio we 

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:32.170
 did not listen to other music 20 months 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:34.310
 the music that I listen to this purpose he got 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:37.250
 a lot of hip hop who what is 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:38.480
 rather far from what I do I 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:39.350
 I'm not really going into music 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:42.290
 others finally I do not have the impression 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:43.880
 may be unconsciously even but the 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:46.130
 things that will give rise to ideas 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:49.340
 it's the one musical instruments and in 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:52.010
 facing me or for memo the things that 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:55.209
 are in less memories the 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:55.209
 evidences like that that go through me 

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:01.580
