that it is like an average game of mine

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.440 
that it is like an average game of mine
there's<00:01:07.160> nothing<00:01:07.280> too<00:01:07.700> special<00:01:07.970> about<00:01:08.240> there

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:08.450

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:10.280 
which is kind of a reason I don't want

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:11.469 
which is kind of a reason I don't want
to<00:01:10.399> post<00:01:10.610> it<00:01:10.789> because<00:01:10.970> I<00:01:11.030> like<00:01:11.179> to<00:01:11.330> keep<00:01:11.420> my

to post it because I like to keep my

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:13.600 
to post it because I like to keep my
gameplay<00:01:11.960> entertaining<00:01:12.649> but<00:01:13.190> it's<00:01:13.399> not

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:13.610 
gameplay entertaining but it's not

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:16.510 
gameplay entertaining but it's not
really<00:01:14.590> that<00:01:15.590> entertaining<00:01:16.100> because<00:01:16.280> it's

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:16.520 
really that entertaining because it's

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:22.029 
really that entertaining because it's
not<00:01:16.670> as<00:01:16.820> good<00:01:17.300> as<00:01:17.479> it<00:01:17.570> usually<00:01:17.720> is<00:01:20.679> but<00:01:21.679> just

00:01:22.029 --> 00:01:22.039 
not as good as it usually is but just

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:23.320 
not as good as it usually is but just
let<00:01:22.190> me<00:01:22.220> know<00:01:22.399> if<00:01:22.490> you<00:01:22.580> want<00:01:22.729> to<00:01:22.820> see<00:01:22.970> it<00:01:23.090> still

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:23.330 
let me know if you want to see it still

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:25.359 
let me know if you want to see it still
because<00:01:23.679> people<00:01:24.679> probably<00:01:24.830> want<00:01:25.070> to<00:01:25.130> see<00:01:25.280> an

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:25.369 
because people probably want to see an

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:27.040 
because people probably want to see an
average<00:01:25.640> name<00:01:25.820> for<00:01:26.030> me<00:01:26.149> and<00:01:26.360> that's<00:01:26.780> pretty

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:27.050 
average name for me and that's pretty

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:29.410 
average name for me and that's pretty
much<00:01:27.280> how<00:01:28.280> a<00:01:28.310> normal<00:01:28.580> game<00:01:28.880> goes<00:01:29.060> from<00:01:29.240> being

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:29.420 
much how a normal game goes from being

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.320 
much how a normal game goes from being
apart<00:01:29.810> from<00:01:30.369> my<00:01:31.369> actually<00:01:31.759> is<00:01:31.820> a<00:01:31.880> bit<00:01:32.090> worse

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:32.330 
apart from my actually is a bit worse

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.109 
apart from my actually is a bit worse
than<00:01:32.570> that<00:01:32.720> than<00:01:32.869> a<00:01:32.899> normal<00:01:33.080> game<00:01:33.409> because<00:01:34.119> it

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:35.119 
than that than a normal game because it

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:37.540 
than that than a normal game because it
was<00:01:35.239> my<00:01:35.360> first<00:01:35.539> game<00:01:35.780> online<00:01:35.959> and<00:01:36.530> in<00:01:37.369> your

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:37.550 
was my first game online and in your

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:39.430 
was my first game online and in your
first<00:01:37.729> game<00:01:37.940> like<00:01:38.390> online<00:01:38.750> usually<00:01:39.140> have

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:39.440 
first game like online usually have

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.160 
first game like online usually have
slightly<00:01:39.709> worse<00:01:39.950> accuracy<00:01:40.429> than<00:01:41.239> you<00:01:41.989> would

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:42.170 
slightly worse accuracy than you would

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.320 
slightly worse accuracy than you would
like<00:01:42.440> later<00:01:42.649> on<00:01:42.830> which<00:01:43.580> probably<00:01:43.910> most<00:01:44.179> you

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:44.330 
like later on which probably most you

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:46.830 
like later on which probably most you
already<00:01:44.599> know<00:01:44.810> that<00:01:44.840> that's<00:01:45.649> snipe<00:01:45.890> anyway

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:46.840
