00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.120
 pants 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.360
 I want you to see how to make some parts of the pants. 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
 This is a Welsh strip 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.200
 We can check the accuracy 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.200
 Pants made from this 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.400
 If we start from the trouser pocket 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.400
 We saw the side of the trouser pocket 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.000
 The patterns are all right 

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:57.640
 Whether horizontal or vertical 

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:01.040
 All the parts worn on the belt are hand-stitched 

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:03.240
 Fixed up and down 

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:07.240
 Finally, the cuffed hem 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.440
 Fixed with a button 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.240
 The fabric has not been cut 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:14.640
 But directly stitched 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:20.040
 Use two edge banding cloths to block the stitching 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.840
 Have a small button 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.040
 I don’t feel it even when I’m ironing my pants. 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.800
 Inside is a British style lining 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.800
 Lining belt with belt 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.200
 Pants pocket all the way down to the inner liner 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.600
 There is a small piece of cloth where there is no trouser pocket 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.640
 Cover sewing thread 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.720
 This work takes a long time 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:55.400
 Sewing of pants first with iron 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.920
 To shape the leg 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:03.000
 According to the shape of the calf part 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.400
 A little backwards... 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.800
 Now let's see what steps are in the pants. 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.480
 Before stitching 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.760
 These jobs are easy 

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:23.160
 Use an iron like this 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.600
 Heated and aspirated plane 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.200
 Then I use steam first. 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:37.200
 Let the fabric swell or shrink 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.600
 After using steam 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:43.800
 Fix the cloth with an air extractor 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.800
 Let it shrink 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.800
 Then make the pants line 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
 Final shaped pants line 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.800
 If the changes are only minor changes 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.560
 Processing inside 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:07.360
 Slightly forward 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.760
 Then shrink 

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:12.360
 Along 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.120
 Pants line 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.720
 Rotate 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.400
 Let it go to this position 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.400
 If I put my pants on 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.200
 On the table 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.600
 You will see that it has pants. 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:45.000
 Turn outwards in the place of the calf 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.200
 Then just end 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:51.800
 You see it is not straight 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.400
 But the front is bent outward 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:57.800
 Backward facing contraction
