00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:03.430
 U 

00:00:04.979 --> 00:00:15.150
 In recent years, come to seem to come a lot of questions about wonjul 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:18.390
 Original bottom fishing m1 Heavy weight than the pierced water is about five times the schedule 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:21.449
 I've been using most of the carbon lines . 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:26.670
 Erin Aki from middle-class fishing 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:28.050
 What you keulram mainly writing twice rattling written in the circumferential bottom fishing fairly 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:34.290
 Light and good. 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:35.699
 So the bottom of the module rather than putting the burden on the morning that module 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.870
 How about writing 

00:00:35.699 --> 00:00:43.019
 There are quite a lot of people who use nails in that way. 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:46.500
 Well then, is it better then Monozuri? 

00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:51.360
 'Cause I give good carbon parts to the idea 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:53.190
 In the bottom fishing we think about some things we should consider as a source 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:57.210
 I have to try. 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:01:02.280
 First, the line should have some degree of tensile strength. 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:03.330
 Oh, it's a big thing, but it's gotta be tensile strength because it does not have to be jacked. 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.810
 Next 

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:07.380
 Ah 

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:10.770
 If you are floating in the water, 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:16.410
 Under the influence of the wind or the flow rate can not go back, so either boiling 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:17.400
 Well that's sitting around a little and go oh its specific gravity than water, is that I stay 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:22.770
 Next 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:30.200
 If you bake ah , you'll be influenced by your debut again . 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:34.770
 So , it is too heavy in weight, so if you sink a lot, 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:39.660
 Because it works by such an influence that makes heavy crushing heavy 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:40.560
 It should be lighter and lighter . It's now lightweight. 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:44.820
 Is it good 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:49.380
 It's a good argument. 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:52.830
 And before, the bottom fishing line should sink steadily. 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:58.950
 I used to think so much part of the subregion 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:02:00.210
 Oh well, I think that you are divided into fishing and returning ordinary rice cake . 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:06.570
 It seems good 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:08.789
 So when seeking here to be a big fish in the hurdles still ansamo 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:12.450
 On the carbon No.3 jjuri 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:17.700
 It 's more stable on the carbon side . 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:19.890
 Oh, if there is a thing, if it is always reduced , most of the depth of the object fishing is one piece. 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:24.510
 Because it is in a low place within 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:26.220
 Sinking weight is very difficult and that red door eojju things in the back row are circumferentially 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:29.040
 When you are floating 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:33.060
 The flow of the flow, the book is sticky. 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:35.430
 It is the same as heavily so, so in that case, 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.819
 Fishing 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:41.200
 Especially, 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:45.069
 If there is no obstacle and you are fishing in such a place 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:49.359
 I am going to go to the army. 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:50.290
 Australia is also doing something like this 1.2 If you like me this route 

00:02:49.359 --> 00:02:54.250
 Daisies 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:55.209
 For those who are new to Mauritius, it is better to start at about 1.25 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:03:00.340
 Seems to 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:03:01.060
 If 1.25 adders are uncomfortable 1.5 Carbon passes over 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:05.439
 good 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:06.999
 Gaboni doesyeotgo me when I say 2a would try again in a distant 1.2 

00:03:05.439 --> 00:03:12.129
 You can fire in space 

00:03:06.999 --> 00:03:16.329
 But the module is heavily weighted . 

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:19.480
 Originally, it's not going down because of surface tension if you throw it to heavy 

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:23.969
 So when I write tangerine today 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:23.969
 Oh, you have to pay attention to the end. First, 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:33.100
 I'm telling you I need to write this one today or 1.25 yah . 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:38.350
 1.25 has a weak tensile strength 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:42.610
 So then to thee crisis tensile sensitivity, then 1.2 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:47.740
 At the time of processing, the knot is bound to the body, and then to the bottom, 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:51.370
 By law saenggimyeon knot seemed like a stand that can not be broken Ah iteunikka 

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:55.180
 You have to be good at the red law, 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:04:00.490
 If you tasted the empty sheep after throwing the surface tension 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:04.780
 If Gyuri go sit down. Why does this by floating in the wind or Ayu 

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:07.600
 Since you can go ahead with the preparation, you must throw the fishing rod 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:14.140
 1q You need to calibrate the back row. 

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:17.980
 Then in the morning, when usually placed above example so that when you look at the end of the sound of water 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:19.540
 There are a lot of people who are doing it, 

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:26.470
 Even when the pine tree 

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:28.330
 Windless day 27 recognized by the bent end of the first words then half what choritdae 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:32.380
 The balance is there is only on water 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:34.960
 If a lot of wind up there I recommend a little more that two married 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:40.120
 I will give you a gift and then 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:43.300
 Ah, Chen is the last video is the slightest doubt we'll need to draw 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:49.210
 The face so hard, too, because the crowd to the top 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:51.160
 I earlier if possible as I explained that using the system requires 528 mokman 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:55.690
 It can be pulled in and out 

00:04:51.160 --> 00:05:01.840
 Oh, well, if you like 20cm and 25cm , you can just listen. 

00:04:55.690 --> 00:05:05.620
 If you have more than 25cm, you must come to the bottom of your back with your sash. 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:11.200
 You can prevent damage to the line. 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:13.570
 Oh , and if you pay attention only to the bottom, 

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:19.360
 Do not worry about it. 

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:24.820
 Especially these days, if the same amount of president Toka go again the very nature nibble Map 

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:29.650
 Lot weaker if the carbon line and what line of carbon in such a case 23 and a flatter 

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:35.169
 Mono- Zuri No. 1 1.25 It is very different when rising t 

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:39.789
 So once you guys use the module, I'll be the big four kids. 

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:40.720
 If you do not observe a few things, 

00:05:39.789 --> 00:05:46.060
 There is a number 

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:49.720
 Do not blame me if iteunikka yiradeunji that the addition of red chamber Act 

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:55.830
 Write'll go sit down while giving attention to these areas 

00:05:49.720 --> 00:06:01.390
 We recommend you try using a mono tool of about 1.25 

00:05:55.830 --> 00:06:07.150
 If I tell you about my first case with Ron 

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:07.930
 When the white lead fishing in an area clear of obstructions are usually up too. What I 

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:11.710
 Write 

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:16.060
 As long as you do not get stuck with obstacles in January 

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:19.030
 When you walked meat is what can be enough to lead carp so 

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:21.910
 Write ah Warner No. 21 

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:25.810
 Whether there are many obstacles or 

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:29.860
 Oh, life is the time to give birth to a monster with bait and then when the sex is satin 

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:35.440
 There is more than five articles of carbon article line work 

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:41.170
 That way, if you are fishing in an area with obstacles along the way, 

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:45.910
 Sseusigo case, the three won 4 of the carbon line of the white lead in addition to the 

00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:50.950
 If you are fishing in a clean place over obstacles 

00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:54.090
 If you are like me , but it is possible for those who are new to it . 

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:54.090
 I think you'd better do it.
