00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:04.780
 Well, now 

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:19.960
 the computer and the box 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:22.840
 and has good different explanations 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:25.380
 they exist in English French Spanish and 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:25.380
 Portuguese 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:29.039
 here what includes 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.900
 okay 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:39.540
 Well, here's the picture of him 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:43.400
 again as always with this 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.400
 working continuity 

00:00:43.859 --> 00:00:49.590
 we have 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:49.590

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.270
 both 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:25.780
 seen that I 

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:29.480
 equally 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:41.030
 no longer 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.690
 the reasons put fences we are not 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:45.320
 workable 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:46.659
 we open 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.730
 we'll see 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:50.450
 yes 

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:53.079
 contains 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.079
 good 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:00.710
 so what 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.710
 Y 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.179
 this is the subwoofer 

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:30.910
 yes 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.910
 yes 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:41.980
 ah 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:49.920
 and what 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.530
 do not 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.370
 we also found a cafe 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:08.230
 5 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.130
 yes 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:20.790
 here we can see is completely 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.790
 discovered 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.620
 and plastics 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:35.959
 already left more we hope to be traffic the 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:35.959
 sales 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.860
 all those little ones 

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:54.910
 two 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:06.970
 Quick 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:10.650
 I would count on this 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:23.539
 with this plastic 

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:32.680
 but a little discussions 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:32.680
 next to 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:44.060
 and 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:05:01.020
 this is the one here as the casualties or 

00:04:57.389 --> 00:05:04.110
 you go up and you have the start button 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:06.300
 off and if you want to use it then 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:08.750
 you have the connected but you 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:08.750
 headphones 

00:05:13.639 --> 00:05:20.479
 this we install this inspires me because 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:20.479
