00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:19.920
 and now a gypsy arm super lady 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.210

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.650
 will impress today so that 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.240
 do it at home we go direct from the 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:28.230
 ingredients for this gypsy arm 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:31.350
 We are going to need 3 egg whites 2 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.310
 thirds cup of sugar glas 3 yolks 

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:36.150
 egg 

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:38.100
 two tablespoons of milk 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:41.580
 two thirds cup of wheat flour 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.950
 a cup of strawberry jam a cup 

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:45.810
 of sweet milk sugar icing for 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.610
 decorate of course if you want to decorate 

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:50.280
 with red fruits red fruits for 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:53.940
 decorate and now if we start flying 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.590
 The most important thing is that our 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.810
 our clear ones are very very 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.610
 clean here so they can climb 

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:01.350
 soon and do not treat us so much let's 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:02.400
 put icing sugar and the whites that 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.910
 let's start to beat 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:08.310
 you have to sponge and are about to 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:10.290
 nougat or in hard peaks we are going to 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.229
 pay it and I want you to see it as 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.630
 it is in hard peaks the peaks do not know no 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.910
 they come off easily and also something 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.610
 important is I can flip my 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:22.740
 container and our mixture does not fall 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.860
 so at this moment you are already eye 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.270
 something also important is that if the 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.979
 beat of more can reach us 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.260
 cut so is to be careful in 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.600
 As soon as our clear 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:35.430
 with the icing sugar is that it is ready 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.610
 let's slow it down now and 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:42.350
 let's incorporate the yolks 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:44.990
 the milk is ready 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:47.170
 and little by little the flour just 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:50.000
 Low or enclosed university 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:52.310
 of pepe is solvent form but here 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.930
 in the blender nothing more low speed 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:57.860
 we see that it is incorporated and we turn off 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:03.260
 our 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:05.450
 our blender is ready 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:07.070
 let's now put it on a tray 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.890
 extending their well-important good 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:11.270
 extended tray with waxed paper yes 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:12.860
 we do not put the waxed 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:14.750
 take it off and I'll then form the roll 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.030
 it's going to be a bit difficult so it's 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:20.210
 waxed paper if you want to put oil 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:28.030
 in spray and let's now yes to pour 

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:32.810
 this mix that is already giving you the last 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:35.870
 passed by integrating all the flour that 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:37.540
 we got stuck is ready to form 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:41.859
 envelope 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:44.980
 effect and now we are going to pour this 

00:02:41.859 --> 00:02:47.200
 mix on top of our tray and 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:50.740
 our waxed paper extending what 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:52.720
 more possible we were here to extend it 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:56.410
 is covering everything perfectly 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:03:00.040
 trying that all sides are 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:03.880
 more or less the same perfect thickness already 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:06.910
 is ready a few taps I'm going to 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:08.740
 take to the oven and let's leave the 180 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:10.330
 degrees centigrade please furnace 

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:13.480
 preheated we're going to get our 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:17.720
 projects before putting it to the one 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:21.730
 we can put the oven without problem 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:24.760
 at 180 degrees 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:27.650
 water delights mouth rolls 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:30.829
 for about 20 minutes nothing more until 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:32.709
 that they see that it is already already firm 

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:35.540
 is cooked of course already explored 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:38.150
 slightly golden here is this that 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:39.620
 came out of the oven let it cool and 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:41.959
 just take it out with all the paper 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:45.470
 aluminum with the waxed paper because in 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:47.390
 This will cover that want 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:50.299
 guys with dulce de leche or jam 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:52.819
 that they crave jam or bread 

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:54.139
 much easier jam we are going to 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:57.290
 spread the jam here because it lists 

00:03:54.139 --> 00:03:58.909
 valencia zamora of grape raspberry 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:01.040
 strawberry that they like the most 

00:03:58.909 --> 00:04:03.349
 chabacano so that you like it 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:05.510
 let's cover it here with enough 

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:07.519
 is jam can be that half the 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:09.670
 cut and half do it with sweet 

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:12.230
 of milk and the other half with 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:15.110
 jam or with cajeta also remains 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:20.829
 wonderful let's roll up 

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:25.770
 let's make the perfect roll 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:27.550
 we are doing this if rolling little by little 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:29.500
 very well 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:32.900
 is ready and we are separating with a lot 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:35.729
 careful waxed paper 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:40.189
 a little more to this list 

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:40.189
 and we are going to roll up the last 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:49.729
 effect and we were there our our 

00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:52.669
 roll and let's now sprinkle it with 

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:55.490
 the glass sugar decorate it with the fruit 

00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:57.199
