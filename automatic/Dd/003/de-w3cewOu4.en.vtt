00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.560 
is f 4 3 7
it's<00:01:23.220> a<00:01:23.340> 27<00:01:24.090> 4<00:01:24.420> and<00:01:24.689> 30<00:01:24.960> so<00:01:25.470> that's<00:01:25.619> the<00:01:25.830> model

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:26.570 
it's a 27 4 and 30 so that's the model

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:31.520 
it's a 27 4 and 30 so that's the model
27<00:01:27.570> for<00:01:27.930> 3<00:01:28.259> rows<00:01:28.590> you<00:01:28.740> can<00:01:28.799> see<00:01:29.189> that<00:01:30.290> anyway<00:01:31.290> I

27 for 3 rows you can see that anyway I

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.649 
27 for 3 rows you can see that anyway I

think that's what makes it more look
more<00:01:33.869> natural<00:01:34.290> because<00:01:34.470> it<00:01:34.829> has<00:01:35.009> three

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
more natural because it has three

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.460 
more natural because it has three
different<00:01:35.549> blended<00:01:36.210> colors<00:01:36.600> and<00:01:36.900> it's

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
different blended colors and it's

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.220
