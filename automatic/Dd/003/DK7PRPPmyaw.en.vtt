00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:30.420
 hi everyone today have to see how 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.730
 decorating a raw vase is not the 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.290
 dÃ©coupage is the cra were then 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.940
 see how to get a vast ego like ad 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.980
 example this has decorated with this 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.590
 card that the thing in the gila alone 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.780
 therefore the purely summer card is 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.670
 all of the other provocations like a 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.399
 finishing cord and roses ai 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.739
 corners I also checked the bottom 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:52.680
 of the tray because we say that 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:56.280
 most subject to contact 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:58.410
 with liquids or other substances therefore e 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.850
 assets originating from with decoration for 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.579
 avoid precisely that if the reveres 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.110
 time a wheelchair is very simple and 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.750
 also easy to make 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.630
 therefore boasts to everyone as well for 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:12.229
 ask for the weapons but as well also 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:15.030
 of great effect and very particular 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:16.770
 the ifab oxa you will find all useless links 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.150
 also the necessary to realize this 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.009
 creation 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.350
 also as always if you have ideas 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:24.150
 questions without minds the doubts problems 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.890
 anything else left a comment below 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.689
 this video 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.670
 I hope I like this idea 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.490
 creation may be useful to you 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.939
 inspiration for your creations 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.939
 so good vision 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:00.160
 once he chose the referendum a 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:01.720
 spread another color on it 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:03.790
 acrylic in this case chooses as 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.080
 it will be a garden acrylic that color 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:07.890
 we always take with a 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:07.890
 sponge brush 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:37.030
 from one made for deco draw like a 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:39.120
 pair of scissors a cutter we remove some 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:41.410
 images and such as these 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:44.110
 after which we dip them in a little water 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:52.660
 we leave them want water for some 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:56.340
 ok way at this point we spread a 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:56.340
 dry and clean absorbent cloth 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:08.470
 we remove excess water with another 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:08.470
 cream star band chose and clean 

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:20.610
 now we can then proceed to 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:23.070
 paste the images on the support but 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:25.500
 first we decide how to put them on 

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:27.660
 support itself after that we go to 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:29.790
 lay on the back of the card o 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:31.590
 directly on the support a little paper 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:34.140
 green able or with the rimini la 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:37.350
 dissolved in water and then you go 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:39.030
 to apply over our image the 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:41.360
 our breakfast then apply them 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:45.440
 we answer the glue on the image 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:45.440
 so we expect it this way 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:22.300
 once the whole is perfectly 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:24.400
 dry then from the glue if 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:26.500
 perfectly dried we go to 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:30.659
 spread a couple of evils from a paint 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:30.659
 liquid protective finish 

00:04:47.529 --> 00:04:52.449
 after having hired perfectly 

00:04:49.329 --> 00:04:54.609
 the various coats of final varnish that 

00:04:52.449 --> 00:04:56.769
 we just applied let's go to 

00:04:54.609 --> 00:05:00.659
 check this part to do this 

00:04:56.769 --> 00:05:02.019
 I will be a resin and that is this resin 

00:05:00.659 --> 00:05:04.269
 of the university 

00:05:02.019 --> 00:05:07.419
 the residence and I must therefore I already have 

00:05:04.269 --> 00:05:10.959
 prepared the mixture then following the 

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:12.449
 instructions given by this package is 

00:05:10.959 --> 00:05:17.469
 also reported in the booklet 

00:05:12.449 --> 00:05:19.629
 instruction, the ratio is 2 to 1 between 

00:05:17.469 --> 00:05:21.179
 two components or tripled doses 

00:05:19.629 --> 00:05:23.859
 because clearly the surface to be 

00:05:21.179 --> 00:05:25.059
 coating is quite large and therefore 

00:05:23.859 --> 00:05:27.639
 has tripled the doses 

00:05:25.059 --> 00:05:30.729
 let's then go against the mixture one 

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:31.809
 once prepared on this part for the 

00:05:30.729 --> 00:05:33.159
 tray 

00:05:31.809 --> 00:05:36.779
 let's then want to dry for 

00:05:33.159 --> 00:05:36.779
 at least 24 hours 

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:56.550
 great 

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:08.259
 so yours is so powerful 

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:11.289
 once the resin is perfectly 

00:06:08.259 --> 00:06:13.300
 hardened here after about a day I have 

00:06:11.289 --> 00:06:15.639
 then added other decorations such as 

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:18.220
 these finishing beads all around 

00:06:15.639 --> 00:06:20.320
 a light let's say about this part of the 

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:22.620
 these tray if we want to find in 

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:25.090
 haberdashery has a thickness of 3 mm 

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:26.650
 also at the corners or added these 

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:29.500
 roses that he colored with a color 

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:32.260
 red acrylic and then dusted with a 

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:33.940
 acrylic color bronze at this time if 

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:36.550
 you want you can protect the whole 

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:38.860
 remaining part of the support with a 

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:42.820
 glossy spray paint such as 

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:44.500
 this is therefore the job is finished 

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:46.780
 I hope you enjoyed this work 

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:49.389
 from this new project browse either 

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:51.780
 then liked the next video bye 

00:06:49.389 --> 00:06:51.780
 to all
