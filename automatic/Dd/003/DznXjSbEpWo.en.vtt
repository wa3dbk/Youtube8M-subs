other members of this death grind family
is<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:03.930> fact<00:01:04.170> that<00:01:04.290> these<00:01:04.650> are<00:01:04.920> songs<00:01:05.280> that

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
is the fact that these are songs that

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.030 
is the fact that these are songs that
are<00:01:06.170> not<00:01:07.170> necessarily<00:01:07.619> going<00:01:07.830> to<00:01:07.950> be

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
are not necessarily going to be

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.410 
are not necessarily going to be
restrictive<00:01:08.580> in<00:01:08.670> length<00:01:08.880> they're<00:01:09.090> not<00:01:09.210> going

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
restrictive in length they're not going

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.090 
restrictive in length they're not going
to<00:01:09.540> be<00:01:09.630> short<00:01:09.869> little<00:01:10.110> you<00:01:10.619> know<00:01:10.740> short<00:01:10.979> little

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
to be short little you know short little

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.710 
to be short little you know short little
tracks<00:01:11.460> instead<00:01:11.670> they're<00:01:12.000> going<00:01:12.210> to<00:01:12.330> be<00:01:12.510> a

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
tracks instead they're going to be a

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.560 
tracks instead they're going to be a
little<00:01:13.470> bit<00:01:13.650> longer<00:01:13.830> almost<00:01:14.310> like<00:01:14.570> your

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
little bit longer almost like your

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.260 
little bit longer almost like your
traditional<00:01:15.720> single<00:01:16.500> for<00:01:16.770> a<00:01:16.799> pop<00:01:17.610> song<00:01:17.909> either

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
traditional single for a pop song either

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:19.609 
traditional single for a pop song either
that<00:01:18.509> are<00:01:18.659> a<00:01:18.689> little<00:01:18.840> bit<00:01:18.960> longer<00:01:19.140> than<00:01:19.439> that

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
that are a little bit longer than that

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.590 
that are a little bit longer than that
so<00:01:19.920> they're<00:01:20.520> kind<00:01:20.729> of<00:01:20.790> taking<00:01:21.180> what<00:01:21.360> I<00:01:21.390> would

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
so they're kind of taking what I would

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.660 
so they're kind of taking what I would
consider<00:01:21.689> to<00:01:22.049> be<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:22.229> aborted<00:01:22.950> approach<00:01:23.280> with

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
consider to be the aborted approach with

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.870 
consider to be the aborted approach with
their<00:01:24.000> version<00:01:24.479> of<00:01:24.630> death<00:01:25.080> grind<00:01:25.380> and<00:01:25.880> they

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
their version of death grind and they

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.210 
their version of death grind and they
are<00:01:27.119> trying<00:01:27.420> to<00:01:27.659> construct<00:01:27.869> full<00:01:28.409> songs<00:01:28.710> that

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
are trying to construct full songs that

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.480 
are trying to construct full songs that
are<00:01:29.549> able<00:01:29.909> to<00:01:30.060> have<00:01:30.780> longer<00:01:31.380> durations<00:01:32.250> of

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
are able to have longer durations of

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.550 
are able to have longer durations of
brutality<00:01:32.880> as<00:01:33.270> opposed<00:01:33.630> to<00:01:33.869> just<00:01:33.900> sticking

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
brutality as opposed to just sticking

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.920 
brutality as opposed to just sticking
with<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.860> short<00:01:35.579> and<00:01:35.670> sweet<00:01:35.880> formula<00:01:36.450> so

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
with the short and sweet formula so

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.319 
with the short and sweet formula so
that's<00:01:37.650> something<00:01:37.950> that's<00:01:38.159> also<00:01:38.549> made<00:01:39.000> cow

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
that's something that's also made cow

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.200 
that's something that's also made cow
decapitation<00:01:40.079> a<00:01:40.140> little<00:01:40.380> bit<00:01:40.470> more<00:01:40.680> I<00:01:41.159> guess<00:01:42.030> I

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
decapitation a little bit more I guess I

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.639 
decapitation a little bit more I guess I
don't<00:01:42.390> want<00:01:42.509> to<00:01:42.570> use<00:01:42.659> the<00:01:42.780> word<00:01:42.960> mainstream

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
don't want to use the word mainstream

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:44.990

done the one thing I have noticed is
that<00:02:33.860> there<00:02:34.100> seems<00:02:34.130> to<00:02:34.520> be<00:02:34.670> a<00:02:34.850> theme<00:02:34.910> of

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
that there seems to be a theme of

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.980 
that there seems to be a theme of
suicide<00:02:37.160> amongst<00:02:37.580> the<00:02:37.670> song<00:02:37.880> titles<00:02:38.300> and<00:02:38.480> amid

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:38.990 
suicide amongst the song titles and amid

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:40.600 
suicide amongst the song titles and amid
some<00:02:39.200> of<00:02:39.320> the<00:02:39.410> lyrics<00:02:39.620> and<00:02:39.950> some<00:02:40.340> of<00:02:40.460> the

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
some of the lyrics and some of the

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:43.480 
some of the lyrics and some of the
random<00:02:41.150> snippets<00:02:41.390> that<00:02:41.660> you<00:02:41.900> get<00:02:42.340> whether<00:02:43.340> it

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:43.490 
random snippets that you get whether it

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:45.250 
random snippets that you get whether it
be<00:02:43.580> from<00:02:43.700> movies<00:02:44.120> or<00:02:44.360> just<00:02:44.600> you<00:02:44.750> know<00:02:44.780> little

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
be from movies or just you know little

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.050 
be from movies or just you know little
things<00:02:45.290> that<00:02:45.590> they've<00:02:45.740> created<00:02:46.010> within<00:02:46.850> the

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
things that they've created within the

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.690 
things that they've created within the
songs<00:02:47.300> and<00:02:47.600> I<00:02:48.160> think<00:02:49.160> some<00:02:49.340> people<00:02:49.580> may

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
songs and I think some people may

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.700 
songs and I think some people may
misconstrue<00:02:50.390> the<00:02:50.540> whole<00:02:50.690> concept<00:02:50.900> of<00:02:51.200> suicide

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:51.710 
misconstrue the whole concept of suicide

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:54.490 
misconstrue the whole concept of suicide
and<00:02:51.980> it's<00:02:52.100> more<00:02:52.820> to<00:02:53.300> do<00:02:53.570> with<00:02:53.690> the<00:02:53.840> cause<00:02:54.050> and

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
and it's more to do with the cause and

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.280 
and it's more to do with the cause and
everything<00:02:54.890> like<00:02:55.040> that<00:02:55.100> where<00:02:56.140> you<00:02:57.140> know

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
everything like that where you know

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:00.580 
everything like that where you know
suicide<00:02:57.980> would<00:02:58.100> almost<00:02:58.340> be<00:02:58.550> the<00:02:58.790> the<00:02:59.440> it's<00:03:00.440> the

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
suicide would almost be the the it's the

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:03.310 
suicide would almost be the the it's the
option<00:03:01.010> that<00:03:01.040> should<00:03:01.310> be<00:03:01.400> done<00:03:01.640> and<00:03:02.140> used<00:03:03.140> by<00:03:03.290> a

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:03.320 
option that should be done and used by a

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:05.590 
option that should be done and used by a
lot<00:03:03.770> of<00:03:03.830> humans<00:03:04.220> if<00:03:04.430> they<00:03:04.550> knew<00:03:04.760> the<00:03:05.150> torture

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:05.600 
lot of humans if they knew the torture

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:08.530 
lot of humans if they knew the torture
that<00:03:05.630> they<00:03:05.930> put<00:03:06.400> animals<00:03:07.400> through<00:03:07.700> so<00:03:08.000> it's

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:08.540 
that they put animals through so it's

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:10.540 
that they put animals through so it's
kind<00:03:08.900> of<00:03:09.020> a<00:03:09.140> unique<00:03:09.530> take<00:03:10.010> on<00:03:10.040> the<00:03:10.430> whole

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:10.550 
kind of a unique take on the whole

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:12.760 
kind of a unique take on the whole
suicide<00:03:10.880> concept<00:03:11.690> as<00:03:11.900> written<00:03:12.320> music<00:03:12.440> it's

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:12.770 
suicide concept as written music it's

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:15.280 
suicide concept as written music it's
not<00:03:12.920> something<00:03:13.310> that<00:03:13.340> you<00:03:13.610> see<00:03:13.880> every<00:03:14.180> day<00:03:14.360> and

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
not something that you see every day and

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:17.320 
not something that you see every day and
because<00:03:15.620> of<00:03:15.650> that<00:03:15.800> this<00:03:16.130> is<00:03:16.340> a<00:03:16.370> theme<00:03:16.910> that<00:03:16.940> may

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:17.330 
because of that this is a theme that may

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:20.229 
because of that this is a theme that may
be<00:03:17.390> explored<00:03:18.140> and<00:03:18.350> explored<00:03:19.250> incorrectly<00:03:19.850> so

00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:20.239 
be explored and explored incorrectly so

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:22.240 
be explored and explored incorrectly so
just<00:03:21.080> to<00:03:21.170> kind<00:03:21.290> of<00:03:21.410> clear<00:03:21.650> that<00:03:21.860> up<00:03:22.010> that's

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.250 
just to kind of clear that up that's

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:24.250 
just to kind of clear that up that's
might<00:03:23.000> not<00:03:23.150> even<00:03:23.270> be<00:03:23.420> the<00:03:23.600> truth<00:03:23.780> I<00:03:23.989> might<00:03:24.230> even

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:24.260 
might not even be the truth I might even

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.380 
might not even be the truth I might even
be<00:03:24.590> looking<00:03:24.890> into<00:03:25.070> this<00:03:25.190> too<00:03:25.760> deeply<00:03:26.090> in<00:03:26.209> a

00:03:58.410 --> 00:03:58.420 
inhibits a lot of destruction so this is

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:00.600

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:00.610 
something that we kind of really cool to

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:02.820 
something that we kind of really cool to
hear<00:04:00.880> live<00:04:01.120> now<00:04:01.510> some<00:04:02.050> people<00:04:02.140> may<00:04:02.440> think<00:04:02.470> that

hear live now some people may think that
this<00:04:02.950> is<00:04:03.310> kind<00:04:03.610> of<00:04:03.700> bordering<00:04:03.970> on<00:04:04.890> getting<00:04:05.890> a

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:05.950 
this is kind of bordering on getting a

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:08.940 
this is kind of bordering on getting a
little<00:04:06.160> close<00:04:06.430> to<00:04:06.610> core<00:04:06.940> but<00:04:07.450> it<00:04:07.810> is<00:04:07.990> nowhere

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:08.950

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:15.580 
cow decapitation is because it's

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:16.530 
cow decapitation is because it's
something<00:04:15.760> different<00:04:15.970> from<00:04:16.239> what<00:04:16.330> they
