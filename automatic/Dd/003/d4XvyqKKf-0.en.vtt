00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
Togekiss goes away and I'm like okay

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.969 
Togekiss goes away and I'm like okay
it's<00:01:03.930> time<00:01:04.199> to<00:01:04.350> see<00:01:04.500> if<00:01:04.739> klefki<00:01:05.100> can<00:01:05.850> do<00:01:06.090> work

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:06.979 
it's time to see if klefki can do work

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:09.500 
it's time to see if klefki can do work
so<00:01:07.979> I<00:01:08.010> send<00:01:08.400> out<00:01:08.520> clef<00:01:08.729> kina<00:01:08.909> I<00:01:09.000> decided<00:01:09.299> this

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
so I send out clef kina I decided this

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.740 
so I send out clef kina I decided this
is<00:01:09.659> a<00:01:09.689> really<00:01:10.020> good<00:01:10.170> time<00:01:10.350> to<00:01:10.799> set<00:01:11.040> up<00:01:11.159> against

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:11.750 
is a really good time to set up against

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:14.030 
is a really good time to set up against
greninja<00:01:12.750> because<00:01:13.110> I<00:01:13.140> know<00:01:13.290> he's<00:01:13.590> going<00:01:13.770> to<00:01:13.920> be

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
greninja because I know he's going to be

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.130 
greninja because I know he's going to be
a<00:01:14.070> special<00:01:14.520> attacker<00:01:14.939> and<00:01:15.270> he's<00:01:15.750> not<00:01:15.930> the

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
a special attacker and he's not the

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.050 
a special attacker and he's not the
strongest<00:01:16.590> special<00:01:17.430> attacker<00:01:17.700> and<00:01:17.970> he

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
strongest special attacker and he

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.170 
strongest special attacker and he
doesn't<00:01:18.330> have<00:01:18.479> anything<00:01:18.780> I'm<00:01:19.080> weak<00:01:19.320> against

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:20.180 
doesn't have anything I'm weak against

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.640 
doesn't have anything I'm weak against
so<00:01:21.180> we<00:01:21.600> can<00:01:21.750> just<00:01:21.930> kind<00:01:22.049> of<00:01:22.080> watch<00:01:22.290> how<00:01:22.500> much

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
so we can just kind of watch how much

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.160 
so we can just kind of watch how much
damage<00:01:23.340> this<00:01:23.430> does<00:01:23.640> even<00:01:24.270> with<00:01:24.420> the<00:01:24.540> +1<00:01:24.960> call

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
damage this does even with the +1 call

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.630 
damage this does even with the +1 call
mine<00:01:25.350> sculpt<00:01:25.860> does<00:01:26.100> a<00:01:26.369> bit<00:01:27.060> of<00:01:27.090> damage<00:01:28.640> like

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
mine sculpt does a bit of damage like

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.730 
mine sculpt does a bit of damage like
that's<00:01:29.909> about<00:01:30.119> 1/5<00:01:30.479> of<00:01:30.570> my<00:01:30.720> health<00:01:30.930> and<00:01:31.140> then

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
that's about 1/5 of my health and then

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.890 
that's about 1/5 of my health and then
he<00:01:31.890> he<00:01:32.220> notices<00:01:32.759> that<00:01:33.030> I'm<00:01:33.150> keep<00:01:33.420> using<00:01:33.750> coal

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
he he notices that I'm keep using coal

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.569 
he he notices that I'm keep using coal
mine<00:01:34.110> so<00:01:34.350> he's<00:01:34.470> trying<00:01:34.650> to<00:01:34.710> out<00:01:34.920> priority<00:01:35.400> with

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
mine so he's trying to out priority with

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.300 
mine so he's trying to out priority with
me<00:01:35.909> with<00:01:36.060> the<00:01:36.180> shadow<00:01:36.420> sneak<00:01:36.979> which<00:01:37.979> actually

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
me with the shadow sneak which actually

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.010 
me with the shadow sneak which actually
does<00:01:38.430> about<00:01:38.640> the<00:01:38.790> same<00:01:39.030> amount<00:01:39.180> of<00:01:39.420> damage<00:01:39.630> so

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
does about the same amount of damage so

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.080 
does about the same amount of damage so
I'm<00:01:40.320> like<00:01:40.500> you<00:01:40.619> know<00:01:40.710> keep<00:01:41.430> using<00:01:41.640> coal<00:01:41.909> mine

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
I'm like you know keep using coal mine

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.630 
I'm like you know keep using coal mine
this<00:01:42.270> is<00:01:42.329> what<00:01:42.540> the<00:01:42.630> strategy<00:01:43.049> is<00:01:43.110> about

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:43.640 
this is what the strategy is about

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.130 
this is what the strategy is about
waiting<00:01:44.640> for<00:01:44.790> that<00:01:44.850> Sitrus<00:01:45.210> berry<00:01:45.390> proc<00:01:45.659> try

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:33.390 
a fire-type it's going to be super

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:36.640 
a fire-type it's going to be super
effective<00:03:33.720> in<00:03:34.500> something<00:03:34.890> with<00:03:35.100> a<00:03:35.160> fire<00:03:35.370> punch

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:36.650 
effective in something with a fire punch

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:38.900 
effective in something with a fire punch
which<00:03:37.650> didn't<00:03:38.010> do<00:03:38.130> as<00:03:38.280> much<00:03:38.460> as<00:03:38.610> I<00:03:38.700> thought

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
which didn't do as much as I thought

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:40.490 
which didn't do as much as I thought
that<00:03:39.300> was<00:03:39.450> still<00:03:39.690> about<00:03:39.900> a<00:03:39.960> quarter<00:03:40.320> of<00:03:40.410> my

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
that was still about a quarter of my

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.530 
that was still about a quarter of my
health<00:03:40.710> and<00:03:40.980> I<00:03:41.670> just<00:03:41.910> go<00:03:42.000> to<00:03:42.030> the<00:03:42.180> thunder<00:03:42.420> wave

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
health and I just go to the thunder wave

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:45.590 
health and I just go to the thunder wave
to<00:03:42.840> be<00:03:42.990> safe<00:03:43.260> you<00:03:43.940> know<00:03:44.940> I'm<00:03:45.060> going<00:03:45.270> to<00:03:45.420> take

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:45.600 
to be safe you know I'm going to take

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.390 
to be safe you know I'm going to take
that<00:03:45.750> hit<00:03:45.960> before<00:03:46.590> attacking<00:03:46.830> anyways<00:03:47.370> I

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
that hit before attacking anyways I

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:48.800 
that hit before attacking anyways I
might<00:03:47.790> as<00:03:47.880> well<00:03:47.970> get<00:03:48.120> my<00:03:48.210> damage<00:03:48.630> out

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
might as well get my damage out

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:52.970 
might as well get my damage out
afterwards<00:03:49.440> that<00:03:50.310> way<00:03:50.400> can<00:03:50.580> heal<00:03:50.760> up<00:03:50.910> more<00:03:51.980> or

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
afterwards that way can heal up more or

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:54.410 
afterwards that way can heal up more or
at<00:03:53.070> least<00:03:53.190> that's<00:03:53.310> my<00:03:53.430> thought<00:03:53.670> I<00:03:53.760> get<00:03:53.970> burned

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:54.420 
at least that's my thought I get burned

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:56.210 
at least that's my thought I get burned
still<00:03:54.810> not<00:03:54.960> worried<00:03:55.320> I<00:03:55.500> still<00:03:55.860> have<00:03:55.980> a<00:03:56.010> third
