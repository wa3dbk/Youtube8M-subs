is a fairly rare event Mars will be
exactly<00:00:16.560> opposite<00:00:17.250> the<00:00:17.310> Sun<00:00:17.609> in<00:00:17.760> the<00:00:17.880> sky<00:00:18.000> and

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
opposition this happens with Mars from

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.810 
opposition this happens with Mars from
Earth's<00:00:29.789> perspective<00:00:30.029> every<00:00:31.070> 778<00:00:32.070> days<00:00:32.520> or

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
Earth's perspective every 778 days or

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.620 
Earth's perspective every 778 days or
two<00:00:33.210> years<00:00:33.570> one<00:00:33.899> month<00:00:34.110> in<00:00:34.350> 18<00:00:34.770> days<00:00:35.480> think<00:00:36.480> of

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
two years one month in 18 days think of

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.229 
two years one month in 18 days think of
Earth<00:00:36.840> and<00:00:37.110> Mars<00:00:37.290> as<00:00:37.649> two<00:00:37.890> cars<00:00:38.160> racing<00:00:38.460> on

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
Earth and Mars as two cars racing on

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.990 
Earth and Mars as two cars racing on
circular<00:00:39.809> tracks<00:00:40.190> now<00:00:41.190> because<00:00:41.579> earth<00:00:41.820> is

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
circular tracks now because earth is

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.229 
circular tracks now because earth is
closer<00:00:42.329> to<00:00:42.480> the<00:00:42.690> Sun<00:00:42.930> it<00:00:43.170> travels<00:00:43.860> faster

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:44.239 
closer to the Sun it travels faster

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:48.440 
closer to the Sun it travels faster
completing<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:45.360> circuit<00:00:45.780> in<00:00:45.930> 365<00:00:46.920> days<00:00:47.450> Mars

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
completing the circuit in 365 days Mars

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.200 
completing the circuit in 365 days Mars
is<00:00:48.750> much<00:00:49.140> farther<00:00:49.800> and<00:00:50.309> it<00:00:50.399> takes<00:00:50.809> 687<00:00:51.809> days

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:53.210 
is much farther and it takes 687 days

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:56.600 
is much farther and it takes 687 days
now<00:00:54.210> in<00:00:54.239> this<00:00:54.570> alignment<00:00:55.170> what<00:00:55.320> I<00:00:55.350> find<00:00:55.710> also

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
now in this alignment what I find also

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.849 
now in this alignment what I find also
is<00:00:57.230> interesting<00:00:58.230> that<00:00:58.350> I<00:00:58.379> wanted<00:00:58.590> to<00:00:58.649> point

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
is interesting that I wanted to point

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:05.260 
is interesting that I wanted to point
out<00:00:59.070> here<00:01:01.039> as<00:01:02.329> you<00:01:03.329> can<00:01:03.480> see<00:01:03.660> here<00:01:03.899> on<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.229> 8th

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:05.270 
out here as you can see here on the 8th

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:14.000 
out here as you can see here on the 8th
this<00:01:06.270> direct<00:01:06.990> alignment<00:01:07.950> taking<00:01:08.580> place<00:01:10.760> and<00:01:13.010> 6

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
this direct alignment taking place and 6

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.410 
this direct alignment taking place and 6
days<00:01:14.310> later<00:01:14.760> it<00:01:15.060> states<00:01:16.759> Mars<00:01:17.759> will<00:01:17.970> be<00:01:18.000> closer

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
days later it states Mars will be closer

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.170 
days later it states Mars will be closer
to<00:01:18.689> Earth<00:01:18.869> still<00:01:19.860> kind<00:01:20.159> of<00:01:20.250> locked<00:01:20.580> into<00:01:20.880> this

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
to Earth still kind of locked into this

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.910 
to Earth still kind of locked into this
now<00:01:21.720> this<00:01:21.930> will<00:01:22.140> be<00:01:22.259> right<00:01:22.439> on<00:01:22.470> the<00:01:22.680> doorstep

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
now this will be right on the doorstep

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.039 
now this will be right on the doorstep
of<00:01:23.369> the<00:01:23.520> Blood<00:01:23.729> Moon

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:24.049 
of the Blood Moon

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:28.460 
of the Blood Moon
so<00:01:25.049> this<00:01:25.560> alignment<00:01:26.100> as<00:01:26.460> it<00:01:26.640> holds<00:01:27.470> throughout

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
so this alignment as it holds throughout

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:35.030 
so this alignment as it holds throughout
this<00:01:28.650> week<00:01:29.689> will<00:01:30.689> end<00:01:32.299> at<00:01:33.350> this<00:01:34.350> blood<00:01:34.710> moon

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
this week will end at this blood moon

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.469 
this week will end at this blood moon
eclipse<00:01:35.960> so<00:01:37.009> that's<00:01:38.009> interesting<00:01:38.340> and<00:01:38.909> if<00:01:39.270> you

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
eclipse so that's interesting and if you

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.380 
eclipse so that's interesting and if you
go<00:01:39.659> from<00:01:39.869> Nissan<00:01:40.380> one<00:01:40.770> out<00:01:41.070> 13<00:01:41.729> days<00:01:42.000> it<00:01:42.240> will

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
go from Nissan one out 13 days it will

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.170 
go from Nissan one out 13 days it will
