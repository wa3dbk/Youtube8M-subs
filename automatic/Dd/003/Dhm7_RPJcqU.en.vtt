00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:06.569
 I'll show you how to fix you today 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:08.400
 mesh crochet and indeed the base fixed 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.950
 mesh there are several others 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.950
 I'll show you the methods 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.230
 in other videos usually if from 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:19.520
 a solid one is then spoken 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:22.800
 like the way I climb you now 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:24.840
 in order to have a firm fix of need 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.820
 I have a base that exists here 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.099
 my case from a chain of air 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:33.719
 but it can also be from one 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:35.760
 larger lever pieces exist or wan 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.390
 stretch my money on a knit 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.110
 piece on 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:45.110
 then that would be the series from kat here at 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:48.120
 I'm going through the air mass chain here 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:50.879
 This one goes through which one like 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.870
 Hopefully, you can have a small head 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.920
 recognize well 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:59.460
 I'm going through these little v's up there 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.050
 You can also say you have something different 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.539
 if you take the fist quasi 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:08.250
 then you want to turn the rule 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:12.810
 chain and grabs here at the 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:14.090
 Potty these chain links here 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.820
 above it 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:20.070
 it is up to each one that's up to you 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:23.280
 simply a question of optics times 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:25.890
 It would be easiest to have it 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.710
 really go in here 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:31.000
 I'm now just also I 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.380
 So have my crochet hook 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.940
 I have my first loop on it 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:38.810
 I need that through the last one 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:42.170
 sling from my air mass chain and 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:47.120
 then i go through the first limb here 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:51.770
 through with my crochet hook and grasps 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:53.960
 Over the roll and draw the colors 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:58.070
 Through this and here I turn the 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:02:00.260
 hunter needle very small piece so that 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:01.850
 the colors do not slip down on me 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:04.430
 so always can me that 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:06.950
 has little head looks at bit also 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:09.980
 the advantage if I am so now 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:12.020
 it could happen through that 

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:14.590
 here the tip part of the head 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:17.210
 I get stuck in the garden 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:20.390
 if I turn that a bit that way 

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:23.600
 the looks at me then I leitwerk 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:26.300
 Yes , I am ambitious here 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:28.490
 my mix pulls and when I'm with 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:30.710
 thumb and middle finger make these 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:33.170
 Guess a bit much like me this one 

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:36.440
 mesh song again so that the 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:38.840
 hook enough distance to have yes i 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:40.220
 If you want to have a good one like this, you have one 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.340
 namely air and can 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:45.890
 accordingly do not get stuck 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:49.130
 I'll go through that now 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:50.840
 so that the brand you also sufficiently wide 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:53.540
 and smells I shove it briefly 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:54.739
 behind is just important for beginners 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:56.660
 because you are at the beginning 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:59.239
 unfortunately in the mesh always much too much 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:02.180
 I definitely want to go here too 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:04.850
 go what I in the video of the 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:07.340
 air masses have shown the stronger me 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:09.709
 here at the index finger goal the closer 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:12.850
 the loop is on here and here 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:15.980
 stronger I pull down here 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:18.170
 Further, the machine will be in year 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:19.819
 I drive up here like that 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:21.260
 rescue 

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:22.579
 pulls the loop on 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:25.519
 or I can of course then 

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:30.349
 also opposed to up, however, leave now 

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:35.359
 I have two loops on a needle 

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:41.170
 and then I take it as it came that one 

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:45.500
 not from above but from below like that 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:48.609
 just like that of mine and pull it 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:52.579
 because through these two loops through 

00:03:48.609 --> 00:03:54.079
 this is what drives the first solid machine times 

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:55.370
 the one in here is the mesh one 

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:58.269
 a little big where I got the 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:04.310
 forced everyone must next to 1 

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:07.370
 if I go again fall thereby 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:10.669
 Here we draw the colors from above here 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:15.669
 by the grace looks at me like that 

00:04:10.669 --> 00:04:19.609
 loop and push with the needle 

00:04:15.669 --> 00:04:22.490
 and are in question 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:24.409
 then in nieste if you did not know 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:24.889
 I already in the mesh or in it 

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:26.930
 Not 

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:30.469
 then you can do that relatively easily 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:36.349
 check how you see I have here 

00:04:30.469 --> 00:04:39.830
 my sling goes through this 

00:04:36.349 --> 00:04:41.629
 where I was in goes through this is 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:46.099
 the bend I made before 

00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:50.780
 it makes it and the bow goes after 

00:04:46.099 --> 00:04:53.719
 because that is here must therefore purely 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:55.759
 the same again and also at 

00:04:53.719 --> 00:04:59.650
 piercing blowing you always look me 

00:04:55.759 --> 00:05:04.759
 to bring the head to the thread from above 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:06.710
 go through and I 'm just always one 

00:05:04.759 --> 00:05:10.009
 Crochet hook relatively far further than ever 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:10.580
 I love the looser you find the 

00:05:10.009 --> 00:05:12.229
 mesh 

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:14.659
 Then, the not so firmly in 

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:16.669
 As you can see, Berlin is loaded 

00:05:14.659 --> 00:05:18.979
 so up here so a bit must be yes 

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:22.639
 also be there because otherwise I come there 

00:05:18.979 --> 00:05:24.500
 bad by now if I have to go here 

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:27.050
 push a bit and me so angel 

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:27.560
 I do not have any colors here 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:29.569
 chance 

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:34.069
 to come through my first loop 

00:05:29.569 --> 00:05:36.560
 Gets means I go really far 

00:05:34.069 --> 00:05:39.319
 behind with my snares we grab 

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:41.659
 the thread from below you through the 

00:05:39.319 --> 00:05:43.219
 ladders course you firmly and pull it 

00:05:41.659 --> 00:05:47.000
 swing the thread through the two 

00:05:43.219 --> 00:05:50.870
 through and I do it then 

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:54.320
 Of course, as often as it is stated 

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:57.830
 a by a bend goal one 

00:05:54.320 --> 00:06:00.170
 loop through both looked through one 

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:02.620
 Sluice pull through a shovel 

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:06.750
 both are sleeping 

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:06.750
 that is this mesh 

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:13.229
 in the basic version other possibilities 

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:18.180
 which one can still fix fixed mesh 

00:06:13.229 --> 00:06:18.180
 I'll show you in the next videos 

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:24.260
 that's how it looks 

00:06:24.689 --> 00:06:29.399
 the solid mesh that is the 

00:06:26.549 --> 00:06:32.719
 lower edge if I'm here now 

00:06:29.399 --> 00:06:32.719
 stabbed 

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:38.930
 and with that you can start and 

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:41.000
 can do with air and mesh firmly 

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:43.069
 already do a lot and also every one 

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:48.380
 lots of beautiful were jekel how to 

00:06:43.069 --> 00:06:51.349
 for example an ipad case or a mobile phone 

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:54.139
 small or or or bag 

00:06:51.349 --> 00:06:56.569
 Of course, there is also an example 

00:06:54.139 --> 00:06:58.940
 see you soon and again 

00:06:56.569 --> 00:07:01.310
 please if you ask or wish 

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:04.310
 just have in the comments below 

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:07.090
 and otherwise there's more to do 

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:07.090
 next video
