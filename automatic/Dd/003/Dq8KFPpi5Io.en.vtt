is so addictive and so my next tattoo is
pretty<00:02:00.110> much<00:02:00.610> me<00:02:01.610> elaborating<00:02:02.300> on<00:02:02.390> what<00:02:02.539> I<00:02:02.569> had

00:02:02.889 --> 00:02:02.899 
pretty much me elaborating on what I had

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:04.719 
pretty much me elaborating on what I had
because<00:02:03.500> it<00:02:03.619> didn't<00:02:03.830> look<00:02:03.920> no<00:02:04.280> it<00:02:04.399> looked<00:02:04.610> like

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:04.729 
because it didn't look no it looked like

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:06.790 
because it didn't look no it looked like
something<00:02:04.940> was<00:02:05.149> missing<00:02:05.259> so<00:02:06.259> I<00:02:06.289> went<00:02:06.560> home<00:02:06.619> and

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:06.800 
something was missing so I went home and
