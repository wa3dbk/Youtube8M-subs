00:00:18.719 --> 00:00:22.439
I search for love

00:00:23.559 --> 00:00:26.239
when the night came

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.799
and it closed in

00:00:31.959 --> 00:00:35.679
I was alone

00:00:36.679 --> 00:00:38.959
but you found me

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.839
where I was hiding

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:48.799
And now I'll never ever be the same

00:00:49.959 --> 00:00:52.879
it was the sweetest voice

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:56.039
that called my name

00:00:56.199 --> 00:00:57.839
saying

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.359
You're not alone

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:05.000
for I am here

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:09.199
let me wipe away your every fear

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:18.039
My love I've never left your side

00:01:18.279 --> 00:01:22.359
I have seen you through the darkest night

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:28.639
and I'm the One who's loved you all your life

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:32.799
all of your life...

00:01:44.599 --> 00:01:48.119
You cry yourself to sleep

00:01:48.959 --> 00:01:51.719
cause the hurt is real

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.799
and the pain cuts deep

00:01:57.359 --> 00:02:01.079
All hope seems lost

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.199
with heartache your closest friend

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:09.039
and everyone else long gone

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:14.359
You've had to face the music on your own

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:18.239
but there is a sweeter song

00:02:18.719 --> 00:02:22.119
that calls you home

00:02:22.279 --> 00:02:23.279
saying

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:26.799
You're not alone

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:30.319
for I am here

00:02:30.679 --> 00:02:35.199
let me wipe away your every fear

00:02:36.679 --> 00:02:43.719
My love I've never left your side

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:47.799
I have seen you through the darkest night

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:53.919
and I'm the One who's loved you all your life

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:56.799
all of your life

00:02:57.399 --> 00:02:59.599
Faithful and true

00:02:59.679 --> 00:03:03.799
forever

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:12.479
for my love will carry you....

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:16.119
You're not alone

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:19.679
for I am here

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.599
let me wipe away your every fear

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:25.919
oh yeah

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:33.000
My love I've never left your side

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:36.439
I have seen you through the darkest night

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:39.559
your darkest night

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:45.679
and I'm the One who's loved you all your life

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:51.159
all of your life...
