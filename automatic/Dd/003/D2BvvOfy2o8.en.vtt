00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.490

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.730
 Points to expect are what you get 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.369
 generally from the keynote at the next 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.439
 wwc can expect that after the feedback 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.050
 the last issue is exactly that 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.850
 Let's have fun 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:25.199
 the questions last issue was the 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.890
 Strongly debated where I am very 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.599
 was pleased 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.000
 and as already announced there is now 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:32.630
 each issue 1 comment of the week 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.130
 which may be from apples this time 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:37.680
 tutorials comes and he wrote below 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:40.290
 other things to the iphone 5 c and to 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.300
 iphone 5 10 with 8gb the price i find 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.570
 actually cheap-iphone would be too much 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.940
 High apple better at five euros or 54 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.190
 You can only go down completely 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.199
 in short he planned a platinum 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.850
 cheap-iphone to bring home but 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.750
 not just a colored iphone for new 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.219
 Target groups 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.660
 there was something in marketing 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.910
 did not work and apple could do her 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.460
 have message does not get across so 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.470
 wanted something went wrong but we never 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.880
 forgot Apple never wanted a cheap one 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.220

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.520

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:35.810
 finds the wwz 2014 in san francisco like 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:37.909
 Usually city ​​apple developers 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:40.070
 Conferences take place every year instead of always 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:42.710

 that's why apple becomes 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:59.780

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.240

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:05.119
