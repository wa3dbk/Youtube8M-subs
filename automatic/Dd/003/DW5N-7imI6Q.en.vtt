00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.339
 hello and welcome to swype 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:08.280
 before tomorrow's review 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.990
 we want to go to htc desire online 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.240
 of course, also look how it is 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.849
 in the games temporal two of the trigger 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.440
 2 and modern combat 5 beats that was 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.970
 usual I have it, of course, just new 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.650
 is also called up 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.600
 Memory is emptied 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.500
 of course no running apps 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.880
 Games are not all 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.830
 pre-installed you get it 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.240
 however in the place gate and I will 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.710
 Close the games again and again 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.449
 before we start a new one that we 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.340
 here really the whole hardware power 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:41.040
 to see now I wish I have 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:42.629
 have fun watching and off you go 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.879
 The beginning is as always ran to the temple 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.440
 two of course not the most elaborate 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.239
 but always play again 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.920
 interesting we are quite good the 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.600
 on screen keys are unfortunately here 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.370
 not hidden at least 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.989
 this black bar disappears here 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.000
 we can not go to it quickly 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.980
 Settings visual quality is 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.660
 Of course, on best and then 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.539
 Let's start right now 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.700
 I still find tempera 2 completely 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.990
 cool you have to tilt the device too and 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.850
 so on then looks quite good the 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.610
 viewpoint and it is really here 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.320
 good topic so the display from the HTC 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.860
 I really like desire a lot 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.130
 Well 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.990
 htc installed in its higher priced 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.060
 I always say smartphones now 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.700
 I'm pretty good displays that now 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.850
 So you know the htc one m7 from power 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:29.040
 now or just the desire that 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.409
 was a smartphone that is the mess 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.329
 but still pretty much 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:35.250
 high end hardware has but I think we 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.930
 are very well tempered 2 runs here 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.119
 really very nice and fluid there 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.100
 nothing to criticize and also 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.860
 I really like the display 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.869
 yes, it's such a game with pretty 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.750
 intense colors I say now the 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.700
 display of the design 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.740
 not at all oversaturated since 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.180
 with too much contrast again very much 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.850
 Nowadays it is a pleasure to do it 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.380
 but just beautiful realistic 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.270
 I really like that and me 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.640
 think we are very well tempered 2 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.619
 is really going on without any problems 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.320
 it starts with the trigger 2 already 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.520
 much more elaborate games we see 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.489
 here will be the on screen 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.890
 buttons are hidden here too we want 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.460
 then before we start the whole thing 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:16.040
 fast in the 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:18.440
 I look for quality settings 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.060
 you always in advance the info what here at 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.340
 first start was set 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.810
 there is for normal smartphones with 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.490
 a qualcomm processor in three 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:27.770
 different quality levels became here 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:29.180
 in the middle I automatically set 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:31.340
 have the whole thing up high 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.870
 put that we can really see 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.640
 if it still runs smoothly but that 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:39.500
 We also know about other smartphones 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:41.959
 eg from the galaxy note 4 xperia z3 or even 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:44.270
 the 8 that one just now manually 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:46.550
 I have to ask what I know what there 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:48.050
 does not work properly is the fakt 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:49.600
 you should always do it you see it me 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:52.269
 I've put the whole thing on high 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:54.260
 By default, it was just on medium and 

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:56.300
 Nevertheless, I think you can see it all 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:59.090
 good that everything here so nicely liquid 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:01.700
 running yes here again the 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:03.200
 graphics really very nice and that 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.300
 here immediately noticed the 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.830
 speakers are just awesome so 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:09.050
 I already mentioned that in unboxing 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:12.200
 we have two front speakers here 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:13.850
 piece so stereo and years although one 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.890
 which barely sees the htc desire 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:17.540
 one of those are just so small 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:19.000
 Slits I say now I show 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:21.380
 of course in the review even more accurate 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.840
 they can really convince them 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:26.660
 quality in the review there is still a 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:28.250
 But I make a short comparison to the HTC 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:30.290
 can tell you this is definitely 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:32.000
 ever better than many many 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:34.310
 other smartphones simply because the 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.260
 are just directed to you on the 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:37.610
 front page that is for example at 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:40.519
 watch videos or here at 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:41.680
 Just play real gold value he has 

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:43.940
 I like that pretty much 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:47.900
 and now we go here again 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:50.380
 continue and play the whole thing 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:50.380
 over 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:56.040
 also the graphics I have it already 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:57.180
 I really like that mentioned here 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.580
 pretty good 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:02.069
 yes that's a good combination of this 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:04.590
 very high quality panel of the desire and 

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:07.019
 the good graphics what the trigger 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:09.420
 two no problems at all here 

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:12.090
 and last but not least now 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:14.069
 modern combat 5 definitely the newest 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:15.780
 and also a pretty elaborate game 

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:17.970
 I have not tried it yet 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:19.260
 let's see how the entire Sun 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:20.699
 I'm running but honestly 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:23.280
 no worries here 

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:25.080
 by the way, wm-eighth always cares 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:27.720
 it is also pretty much running users 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:28.949
 hard quickly, please excuse us 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.500
 need a few files now 

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:32.100
 be unpacked but that works 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:34.050
 actually pretty much according to experience 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:36.600
 fast and then we can do the same 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:38.250
 already start a few words 

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:40.080
 so still to the heat development as I said 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:42.479
 Now I have two games now 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:45.539
 previously played after modern combat 5 

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:46.860
 is there another one ? 

00:04:45.539 --> 00:04:48.270
 exact report but the 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:49.289
 heat development is not on here 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:51.360
 case exaggerated 

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:53.520
 so far it's getting a bit warmer on the 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:55.770
 back but yes it goes in mine 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:56.940
 eyes still fine nothing 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:58.979
 would somehow disturb 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:00.300
 yes that is known from many 

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:02.160
 many other smartphones 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:04.260
 and then it should all be here now 

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:06.360
 Start the whole skip right now 

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:08.370
 I'm short and now we can 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:10.080
 already started, please excuse me 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:12.450
 I usually do that cut 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:14.099
 not in the games as I said that 

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:16.349
 had to load here for the first time 

00:05:14.099 --> 00:05:18.539
 and we start directly 

00:05:16.349 --> 00:05:21.750
 modern combat five already looks here 

00:05:18.539 --> 00:05:23.370
 pretty good again and i think so 

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:25.050
 already seen the entry 

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:26.849
 There was no stuttering 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:28.710
 but yes we play the whole course 

00:05:26.849 --> 00:05:34.370
 a little further 

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:34.370
 The construction also has to believe in it and 

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:42.210
 then we also caught and 

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:43.800
 go on up here we know that 

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:45.900
 whole looks really pretty good here 

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:47.700
 I have to say that and how it was 

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:50.220
 on most smartphones with the 

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:52.050
 qualcomm snapdragon 8 and 1 are saying 

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:53.340
 Of course, many of you again 

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:57.030
 have you had so many smartphones? 

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:59.400
 with the qst 801 why then again 

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:01.960
 gaming video because I always find 

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:03.699
 you should look like that 

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:05.350
 at the devices then it looks just 

00:06:03.699 --> 00:06:07.330
 can always give problems 

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:09.639
 we've had so many gaming already 

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:11.680
 videos where then somehow yes on the 

00:06:09.639 --> 00:06:12.150
 most simple games do not play smoothly 

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:15.190
 walked 

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:17.470
 insofar nobody harms that 

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:19.599
 video but I think you also see it here 

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:21.699
 Everything looks very liquid 

00:06:19.599 --> 00:06:23.770
 on superhot from I already 

00:06:21.699 --> 00:06:24.789
 more often I like modern combat five 

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:27.639
 just very much 

00:06:24.789 --> 00:06:29.229
 the locations here in the case just 

00:06:27.639 --> 00:06:31.110
 Venice is really hard 

00:06:29.229 --> 00:06:33.430
 given 

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:35.080
 I like it a lot and I think so 

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:36.970
 we also see that this is everything 

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:38.320
 runs smoothly I think quite a bit 

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:40.240
 I do not have to have you anymore 

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:41.979
 show what can be said in conclusion 

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:43.870
 As you might expect she had 

00:06:41.979 --> 00:06:45.490
 of course this also in the subject of gaming 

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:47.740
 and do not play problems 

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:48.940
 everything is running smoothly the graphics are synonymous 

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:50.560
 really top and especially the 

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:52.300
 Front speakers really have me 

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:55.240
 pretty well liked heat development 

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:57.460
 is not a really barely noticeable 

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:59.440
 is also no reason for criticism 

00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:00.819
 rather, people like that from this short one 

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:02.650
 gaming test i hope it has you 

00:07:00.819 --> 00:07:04.509
 Many thanks for watching 

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:07.229
 We'll see you again in the review 

00:07:04.509 --> 00:07:07.229
 htc desire
