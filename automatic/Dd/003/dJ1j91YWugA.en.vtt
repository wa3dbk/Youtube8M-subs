usually<00:02:14.690> have<00:02:14.870> and<00:02:15.260> learning<00:02:15.530> this<00:02:15.650> trick<00:02:15.860> is

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:16.990 
usually have and learning this trick is

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:20.610 
usually have and learning this trick is
when<00:02:17.990> they<00:02:18.110> go<00:02:18.320> in<00:02:18.530> to<00:02:18.860> do<00:02:19.220> the<00:02:19.400> 360<00:02:19.730> bluntslide

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
when they go in to do the 360 bluntslide

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.050 
when they go in to do the 360 bluntslide
they<00:02:21.620> can't<00:02:21.890> finish<00:02:22.160> the<00:02:22.430> rotation<00:02:22.550> they'll

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
they can't finish the rotation they'll

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.930 
they can't finish the rotation they'll
get<00:02:23.240> around<00:02:23.360> about<00:02:24.350> 3/4<00:02:25.070> of<00:02:25.100> the<00:02:25.250> way<00:02:25.370> and<00:02:25.820> then

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
get around about 3/4 of the way and then

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:27.400 
get around about 3/4 of the way and then
their<00:02:26.090> wheels<00:02:26.300> to<00:02:26.450> touch<00:02:26.630> back<00:02:26.810> down<00:02:26.870> and

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
their wheels to touch back down and

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:30.820 
their wheels to touch back down and
it'll<00:02:27.590> be<00:02:27.680> sent<00:02:27.950> off<00:02:28.100> the<00:02:28.130> board<00:02:29.140> to<00:02:30.140> fix<00:02:30.500> that

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830 
it'll be sent off the board to fix that

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:34.390 
it'll be sent off the board to fix that
I<00:02:31.150> would<00:02:32.150> suggest<00:02:32.720> just<00:02:33.290> bringing<00:02:34.100> the<00:02:34.190> nose

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
I would suggest just bringing the nose

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.280 
I would suggest just bringing the nose
of<00:02:34.820> your<00:02:35.090> board<00:02:35.120> a<00:02:35.450> bit<00:02:35.660> higher<00:02:35.870> put<00:02:36.110> a<00:02:36.140> bit

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 
of your board a bit higher put a bit

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.750 
of your board a bit higher put a bit
more<00:02:36.320> weight<00:02:36.470> on<00:02:36.920> the<00:02:37.130> tail<00:02:37.490> and<00:02:38.470> that<00:02:39.470> way

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
more weight on the tail and that way

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.040 
more weight on the tail and that way
you'll<00:02:40.760> have<00:02:40.790> a<00:02:40.940> bit<00:02:41.180> more<00:02:41.360> time<00:02:41.630> to<00:02:41.840> finish

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.050 
you'll have a bit more time to finish

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:44.080 
you'll have a bit more time to finish
your<00:02:42.320> 360<00:02:42.800> rotation<00:02:43.130> before<00:02:43.640> the<00:02:43.820> wheels

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
your 360 rotation before the wheels

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.360 
your 360 rotation before the wheels
touch<00:02:44.269> back<00:02:44.570> down<00:02:44.870> again<00:02:45.769> don't<00:02:46.010> put<00:02:46.130> too<00:02:46.340> much

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
touch back down again don't put too much

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.550 
touch back down again don't put too much
weight<00:02:46.760> or<00:02:47.030> else<00:02:47.209> your<00:02:47.390> tail<00:02:47.660> is<00:02:48.140> gonna<00:02:48.320> hit

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
weight or else your tail is gonna hit

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:54.280 
weight or else your tail is gonna hit
the<00:02:48.650> ground<00:02:48.769> and<00:02:49.100> you'll<00:02:49.280> slide<00:02:49.519> out

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:57.170
