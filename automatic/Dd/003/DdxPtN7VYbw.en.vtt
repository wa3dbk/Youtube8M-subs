00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:14.360 
I'm actually not so disappointed because

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:16.550 
I'm actually not so disappointed because
it's<00:00:15.360> the<00:00:15.420> Community<00:00:15.809> Shield<00:00:15.990> and<00:00:16.289> I<00:00:16.379> always

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
it's the Community Shield and I always

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.080 
it's the Community Shield and I always
felt<00:00:16.740> we<00:00:16.920> were<00:00:17.010> in<00:00:17.039> it<00:00:17.220> in<00:00:17.550> fact<00:00:17.789> I<00:00:17.820> thought<00:00:17.970> we

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
felt we were in it in fact I thought we

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.500 
felt we were in it in fact I thought we
could<00:00:18.180> have<00:00:18.300> equalized<00:00:19.250> in<00:00:20.250> both<00:00:20.430> arts<00:00:20.789> and<00:00:21.150> in

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
could have equalized in both arts and in

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.120 
could have equalized in both arts and in
the<00:00:21.600> second<00:00:21.900> half<00:00:22.050> I<00:00:22.260> thought<00:00:22.439> we<00:00:22.949> had<00:00:23.039> the

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
the second half I thought we had the

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.609 
the second half I thought we had the
much<00:00:23.250> better<00:00:23.400> of<00:00:23.580> the<00:00:23.670> game<00:00:23.820> I<00:00:24.600> just<00:00:25.470> think

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
much better of the game I just think

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:26.750 
much better of the game I just think
they<00:00:25.680> had<00:00:25.769> more<00:00:25.920> pace<00:00:26.130> than<00:00:26.340> we<00:00:26.460> did<00:00:26.519> in<00:00:26.699> the

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
they had more pace than we did in the

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.910 
they had more pace than we did in the
first<00:00:26.939> half<00:00:27.260> and<00:00:28.260> I<00:00:28.349> think<00:00:28.590> the

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
first half and I think the

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.019 
first half and I think the
oxlade-chamberlain<00:00:29.250> guy<00:00:29.760> was<00:00:29.939> the

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
oxlade-chamberlain guy was the

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.669 
oxlade-chamberlain guy was the
difference<00:00:30.359> how<00:00:30.929> do<00:00:31.019> you<00:00:31.140> think<00:00:31.260> Peter<00:00:31.500> Tech

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
difference how do you think Peter Tech

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.130 
difference how do you think Peter Tech
impacted<00:00:32.160> do<00:00:32.730> you<00:00:32.790> think<00:00:32.940> that<00:00:33.140> transformed

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
impacted do you think that transformed

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.410 
impacted do you think that transformed
the<00:00:34.230> Arsenal's<00:00:34.559> defense<00:00:34.860> now<00:00:35.160> I<00:00:35.880> think<00:00:36.239> you

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
the Arsenal's defense now I think you

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.810 
the Arsenal's defense now I think you
made<00:00:36.570> a<00:00:36.630> great<00:00:36.750> couple<00:00:37.110> of<00:00:37.260> saves<00:00:37.610> he<00:00:38.610> seemed

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
made a great couple of saves he seemed

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.369 
made a great couple of saves he seemed
to<00:00:38.969> know<00:00:39.059> which<00:00:39.239> way<00:00:39.390> Oscar<00:00:39.660> was<00:00:39.780> kicking<00:00:40.290> it

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
to know which way Oscar was kicking it

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.260 
to know which way Oscar was kicking it
for<00:00:40.559> the<00:00:40.980> free<00:00:41.160> kick<00:00:41.340> in<00:00:41.460> the<00:00:41.550> second<00:00:41.879> half<00:00:42.000> I

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
for the free kick in the second half I

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.119 
for the free kick in the second half I
was<00:00:42.719> watching<00:00:43.110> him<00:00:43.230> and<00:00:43.500> he<00:00:43.559> was<00:00:43.710> marching<00:00:44.070> the

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
was watching him and he was marching the

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:45.860 
was watching him and he was marching the
defence<00:00:44.399> a<00:00:44.550> lot<00:00:44.700> more<00:00:44.879> than<00:00:44.969> says<00:00:45.360> any<00:00:45.570> word<00:00:45.719> or

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
defence a lot more than says any word or

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.770 
defence a lot more than says any word or
a<00:00:45.930> spinner<00:00:46.260> would<00:00:47.180> we<00:00:48.180> are<00:00:48.329> today<00:00:48.600> you're

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
a spinner would we are today you're

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.630 
a spinner would we are today you're
right<00:00:49.489> but<00:00:51.440> we'll<00:00:52.440> see<00:00:52.590> it's<00:00:53.100> all<00:00:53.250> it's<00:00:53.550> all

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
right but we'll see it's all it's all

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.600 
right but we'll see it's all it's all
down<00:00:53.789> to<00:00:53.820> detail<00:00:54.270> it<00:00:54.870> starts<00:00:55.140> next<00:00:55.289> Saturday

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:55.610 
down to detail it starts next Saturday

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:57.680 
down to detail it starts next Saturday
so<00:00:56.610> for<00:00:56.879> the<00:00:56.940> league<00:00:57.090> are<00:00:57.329> you<00:00:57.449> still

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
so for the league are you still

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.410 
so for the league are you still
optimistic<00:00:57.989> or<00:00:58.680> just<00:00:58.800> illness<00:00:59.070> I<00:00:59.489> think<00:01:00.059> it's

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
optimistic or just illness I think it's

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:01.580 
optimistic or just illness I think it's
difficult<00:01:00.660> to<00:01:00.840> win<00:01:00.930> it<00:01:01.050> two<00:01:01.199> years<00:01:01.230> on<00:01:01.500> the

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
difficult to win it two years on the

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.310 
difficult to win it two years on the
bounce<00:01:02.270> and<00:01:03.270> that's<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:03.719> only<00:01:03.930> reason<00:01:03.960> I

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
bounce and that's the only reason I

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.960 
bounce and that's the only reason I
think<00:01:04.500> we<00:01:04.619> won't<00:01:04.799> win<00:01:04.949> it

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
think we won't win it

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.060 
think we won't win it
I<00:01:06.030> think<00:01:06.659> Arsenal<00:01:07.200> are<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:07.650> strongest

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
I think Arsenal are the strongest

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.950 
I think Arsenal are the strongest
contenders<00:01:08.700> and<00:01:08.820> I<00:01:08.850> did<00:01:09.000> think<00:01:09.240> that<00:01:09.299> before

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
contenders and I did think that before

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.410 
contenders and I did think that before
this<00:01:10.260> game<00:01:10.530> anyway<00:01:10.799> which<00:01:11.790> is<00:01:11.970> why<00:01:12.150> I'm<00:01:12.360> not

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
this game anyway which is why I'm not

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.960 
this game anyway which is why I'm not
too<00:01:12.659> disappointed<00:01:12.869> because<00:01:13.439> I<00:01:14.159> thought<00:01:14.189> we

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
too disappointed because I thought we

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.240 
too disappointed because I thought we
were<00:01:15.060> in<00:01:15.119> this<00:01:15.330> game<00:01:15.619> and<00:01:16.619> they<00:01:16.920> started

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
were in this game and they started

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.830 
were in this game and they started
training<00:01:17.460> 10<00:01:17.820> days<00:01:17.970> before<00:01:18.119> we<00:01:18.450> did<00:01:18.630> their

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
training 10 days before we did their

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.170 
training 10 days before we did their
preseason<00:01:19.290> started<00:01:20.220> ten<00:01:20.430> days<00:01:20.580> before<00:01:20.759> us

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
preseason started ten days before us

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.350 
preseason started ten days before us
there<00:01:21.659> about<00:01:21.900> two<00:01:22.110> games<00:01:22.350> ahead<00:01:22.590> of<00:01:22.680> us<00:01:22.860> I

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:23.360 
there about two games ahead of us I

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.760 
there about two games ahead of us I
thought<00:01:24.360> we<00:01:24.509> vanovech<00:01:24.869> look<00:01:25.110> sluggish

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
thought we vanovech look sluggish

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.859 
thought we vanovech look sluggish
surprisingly<00:01:26.610> slow<00:01:28.250> and<00:01:29.250> I<00:01:29.790> just<00:01:30.000> think<00:01:30.240> we

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
surprisingly slow and I just think we

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:31.910 
surprisingly slow and I just think we
just<00:01:31.020> looked<00:01:31.229> a<00:01:31.320> little<00:01:31.380> bit<00:01:31.560> under<00:01:31.740> threat

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
just looked a little bit under threat

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.410 
just looked a little bit under threat
against<00:01:32.250> pace<00:01:32.430> which<00:01:32.670> is<00:01:32.790> a<00:01:32.820> bit<00:01:32.970> of<00:01:33.030> a<00:01:33.090> concern

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
against pace which is a bit of a concern

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.179 
against pace which is a bit of a concern
where<00:01:34.259> do<00:01:34.350> you<00:01:34.409> feel<00:01:34.590> we<00:01:34.680> need<00:01:34.829> to<00:01:34.920> strengthen

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
where do you feel we need to strengthen

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.620 
where do you feel we need to strengthen
is<00:01:35.490> there<00:01:35.610> any<00:01:35.729> way<00:01:35.850> you<00:01:35.909> feel<00:01:36.000> when<00:01:36.390> used<00:01:36.540> to

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
is there any way you feel when used to

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.330 
is there any way you feel when used to
strengthen<00:01:36.840> are<00:01:37.079> we<00:01:37.170> weak<00:01:37.350> in<00:01:37.530> any<00:01:37.650> areas<00:01:37.979> I'd

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
strengthen are we weak in any areas I'd

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.399 
strengthen are we weak in any areas I'd
like<00:01:38.490> to<00:01:38.610> see<00:01:38.790> one<00:01:39.000> more<00:01:39.210> holding<00:01:39.930> midfielder

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
like to see one more holding midfielder

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.620 
like to see one more holding midfielder
