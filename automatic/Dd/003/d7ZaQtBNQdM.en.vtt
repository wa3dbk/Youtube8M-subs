00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:00.920 
also what kind of makes it deep i think

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.649 
also what kind of makes it deep i think
is<00:02:01.009> that<00:02:01.039> it's<00:02:01.280> very<00:02:01.460> challenging<00:02:01.820> and<00:02:02.330> so<00:02:02.509> in

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:02.659 
is that it's very challenging and so in

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:05.770 
is that it's very challenging and so in
order<00:02:02.780> to<00:02:02.899> actually<00:02:03.670> beat<00:02:04.670> the<00:02:04.880> game<00:02:05.180> in<00:02:05.509> some

game and the second two there's two
variations<00:05:45.770> on<00:05:46.280> each<00:05:46.430> of<00:05:46.580> them<00:05:46.730> rather<00:05:46.940> nice

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:47.270 
variations on each of them rather nice

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:49.030 
variations on each of them rather nice
yeah<00:05:47.720> so<00:05:47.930> there's<00:05:48.080> totally<00:05:48.500> new<00:05:48.620> areas

yeah so there's totally new areas

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:51.190 
yeah so there's totally new areas
totally<00:05:49.910> different<00:05:50.240> quests<00:05:50.510> depending<00:05:51.200> on

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:51.200 
totally different quests depending on

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:52.690 
totally different quests depending on
what<00:05:51.410> you<00:05:51.470> chose<00:05:51.650> in<00:05:51.830> the<00:05:51.890> first<00:05:52.100> half<00:05:52.250> I<00:05:52.490> mean

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:52.700 
what you chose in the first half I mean

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:54.910 
what you chose in the first half I mean
I<00:05:52.880> could<00:05:53.060> see<00:05:53.240> a<00:05:53.480> difference<00:05:54.140> for<00:05:54.440> like<00:05:54.680> a

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:54.920 
I could see a difference for like a

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:56.770 
I could see a difference for like a
middle<00:05:55.490> one<00:05:55.670> maybe<00:05:55.940> and<00:05:56.240> it<00:05:56.360> comes<00:05:56.570> together

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:56.780 
middle one maybe and it comes together

00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:58.270 
middle one maybe and it comes together
at<00:05:57.080> the<00:05:57.230> end<00:05:57.260> but<00:05:57.560> you're<00:05:57.740> telling<00:05:58.010> me<00:05:58.100> that

00:05:58.270 --> 00:05:58.280 
at the end but you're telling me that

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:00.430 
at the end but you're telling me that
the<00:05:58.820> two<00:05:59.060> acts<00:05:59.480> are<00:05:59.810> just<00:06:00.080> completely

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:00.440 
the two acts are just completely

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:02.020 
the two acts are just completely
different<00:06:00.800> well<00:06:01.280> did<00:06:01.370> you<00:06:01.490> come<00:06:01.670> down<00:06:01.700> to<00:06:02.000> the

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:02.030 
different well did you come down to the

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:03.820 
different well did you come down to the
same<00:06:02.240> location<00:06:02.390> at<00:06:02.900> the<00:06:02.930> end<00:06:03.140> but<00:06:03.440> they<00:06:03.650> have

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:03.830 
same location at the end but they have

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:06.310 
same location at the end but they have
totally<00:06:04.130> different<00:06:04.190> questions<00:06:04.700> so<00:06:05.000> well<00:06:05.780> so

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:06.320 
totally different questions so well so

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:08.860 
totally different questions so well so
does<00:06:06.500> it<00:06:06.680> end<00:06:06.890> up<00:06:07.310> with<00:06:07.550> the<00:06:07.910> same<00:06:07.940> ending

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:08.870 
does it end up with the same ending

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:09.900 
does it end up with the same ending
essentially

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:09.910 
essentially

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:12.210 
essentially
is<00:06:10.000> it<00:06:10.210> another<00:06:10.570> red<00:06:10.930> green<00:06:11.200> blue<00:06:11.530> well<00:06:12.070> it's

is it another red green blue well it's

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:14.790 
is it another red green blue well it's
sort<00:06:12.460> of<00:06:12.550> interesting<00:06:12.970> because<00:06:13.510> you<00:06:14.290> do

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:14.800 
sort of interesting because you do

sort of interesting because you do
choose<00:06:15.090> sort<00:06:16.090> of<00:06:16.240> the<00:06:16.510> ending<00:06:16.900> but<00:06:17.290> over<00:06:18.070> the

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:18.160 
choose sort of the ending but over the

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:19.800 
choose sort of the ending but over the
course<00:06:18.460> of<00:06:18.700> the<00:06:18.760> game<00:06:19.060> you'll<00:06:19.330> get<00:06:19.510> different

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:19.810 
course of the game you'll get different

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:21.390 
course of the game you'll get different
information<00:06:20.320> depending<00:06:20.860> on<00:06:21.070> your<00:06:21.160> choices

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:23.740 
and it will require it requires multiple

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:25.820 
and it will require it requires multiple
playthroughs<00:06:24.190> to<00:06:24.670> really<00:06:25.180> get<00:06:25.330> an<00:06:25.480> idea<00:06:25.570> of
