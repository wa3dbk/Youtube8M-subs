00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
bits inside sometimes it's just easier

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:38.959

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:42.590 
can save the seeds and roast those if
you<00:00:41.430> want<00:00:41.610> to<00:00:41.790> or<00:00:42.000> you<00:00:42.090> can<00:00:42.180> just<00:00:42.239> throw<00:00:42.510> them

into quarters and I can't stress how

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.770 
into quarters and I can't stress how
important<00:00:49.260> it<00:00:49.289> is<00:00:49.440> to<00:00:49.500> use<00:00:49.950> a<00:00:49.980> sharp<00:00:50.550> knife
