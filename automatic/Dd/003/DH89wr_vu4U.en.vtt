and I'm using a dark thread so that you
can't<00:00:03.000> see<00:00:03.419> the<00:00:03.870> background<00:00:04.560> as<00:00:05.549> you<00:00:05.790> can't

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.000 
can't see the background as you can't

can't see the background as you can't
step<00:00:06.359> pretty<00:00:06.660> difficult<00:00:06.870> to<00:00:07.259> see<00:00:07.470> usually<00:00:07.950> you

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
put a backing on it but I didn't do a

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:11.720 
put a backing on it but I didn't do a
backing<00:00:10.500> on<00:00:10.620> this<00:00:10.860> because<00:00:11.219> I've<00:00:11.370> just<00:00:11.550> been

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
backing on this because I've just been

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.120 
backing on this because I've just been
goofing<00:00:12.090> around<00:00:12.150> with<00:00:12.420> that<00:00:12.690> but<00:00:13.620> I'm<00:00:13.710> backing

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
goofing around with that but I'm backing

goofing around with that but I'm backing
me<00:00:14.280> up<00:00:14.309> we<00:00:14.820> usually<00:00:15.120> put<00:00:15.330> a<00:00:15.360> cotton<00:00:15.809> backing<00:00:16.199> on

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
me up we usually put a cotton backing on

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.810 
me up we usually put a cotton backing on
the<00:00:16.650> back<00:00:16.789> for<00:00:18.890> for<00:00:19.890> when<00:00:20.070> you're<00:00:20.279> doing<00:00:20.310> a

really<00:00:21.240> good<00:00:21.359> piece<00:00:21.810> I'm<00:00:22.500> just<00:00:22.800> goofing

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
really good piece I'm just goofing

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.910 
really good piece I'm just goofing
around<00:00:23.189> with<00:00:23.550> this<00:00:23.699> but<00:00:24.029> this<00:00:24.240> is<00:00:24.420> a<00:00:24.920> you

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
around with this but this is a you

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.490 
around with this but this is a you
always<00:00:26.310> put<00:00:26.699> a<00:00:26.730> background<00:00:27.689> on<00:00:27.960> that<00:00:28.199> helps

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
always put a background on that helps

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:34.190 
always put a background on that helps
secure<00:00:28.710> your<00:00:29.310> thread<00:00:31.160> for<00:00:32.160> a<00:00:32.189> good<00:00:32.369> piece<00:00:33.200> so

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
secure your thread for a good piece so

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:45.740 
secure your thread for a good piece so
there's<00:00:34.380> my<00:00:34.590> thread<00:00:35.149> my<00:00:36.149> needle<00:00:36.180> and<00:00:44.480> you<00:00:45.480> pass

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
there's my thread my needle and you pass

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.360 
there's my thread my needle and you pass
it<00:00:45.989> through<00:00:46.020> as<00:00:46.289> close<00:00:46.530> as<00:00:46.739> you<00:00:46.860> can<00:00:47.160> because

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
it through as close as you can because

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.100 
it through as close as you can because
you<00:00:47.550> would<00:00:47.760> like<00:00:47.940> your<00:00:48.120> piece<00:00:48.329> as<00:00:48.539> tight<00:00:48.870> as

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
you would like your piece as tight as

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.920 
you would like your piece as tight as
they<00:00:49.320> can<00:00:49.620> be

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:53.930 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:56.660 

get<00:00:54.930> your<00:00:55.110> beads<00:00:55.320> out<00:00:55.620> sometimes<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.399> beads

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
get your beads out sometimes the beads

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.220 
get your beads out sometimes the beads
are<00:00:57.149> are<00:00:59.270> difficult<00:01:00.270> to<00:01:00.420> go<00:01:00.570> through<00:01:00.930> the

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
are are difficult to go through the

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.320 
are are difficult to go through the
threads<00:01:02.070> but<00:01:03.409> it's<00:01:04.409> easier<00:01:04.769> to<00:01:04.890> work<00:01:05.760> from<00:01:06.150> a

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
threads but it's easier to work from a

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.399 
threads but it's easier to work from a
casing<00:01:07.260> that<00:01:07.439> it<00:01:07.619> is<00:01:07.770> on<00:01:08.100> on<00:01:09.060> a<00:01:09.119> flat<00:01:10.110> surface

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
casing that it is on on a flat surface

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.289 
casing that it is on on a flat surface
so<00:01:10.860> your<00:01:11.010> beads<00:01:11.250> don't<00:01:11.490> roll<00:01:11.729> around<00:01:11.880> on<00:01:12.210> the

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
so your beads don't roll around on the

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:16.420 
so your beads don't roll around on the
floor<00:01:12.570> and<00:01:13.310> then<00:01:14.310> you<00:01:14.430> just<00:01:14.780> there's<00:01:15.780> one<00:01:16.049> bead

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:16.430 
floor and then you just there's one bead

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:22.850 
floor and then you just there's one bead
we<00:01:17.430> usually<00:01:17.759> work<00:01:18.000> about<00:01:18.299> four<00:01:18.900> beads<00:01:19.200> on<00:01:19.530> a<00:01:21.860> on

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
we usually work about four beads on a on

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:33.210 
we usually work about four beads on a on
a<00:01:22.920> row

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:33.220 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:38.380 

don't<00:01:34.220> go<00:01:34.370> already<00:01:34.520> there<00:01:34.990> for<00:01:35.990> beads<00:01:37.390> you

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:38.390 
don't go already there for beads you

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:44.230 
don't go already there for beads you
secure<00:01:38.900> them<00:01:39.110> up<00:01:39.290> like<00:01:39.530> this<00:01:42.640> you<00:01:43.640> find<00:01:44.000> a

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.240 
secure them up like this you find a

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.770 
secure them up like this you find a
comfortable<00:01:44.690> area<00:01:45.080> to<00:01:45.530> fit<00:01:45.770> them<00:01:45.950> in<00:01:46.780> like

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:47.780 
comfortable area to fit them in like

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.280 
comfortable area to fit them in like
that<00:01:48.080> and<00:01:48.770> then<00:01:49.730> what<00:01:50.150> you<00:01:50.330> do<00:01:50.510> the<00:01:50.750> secret<00:01:51.200> of

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:51.290 
that and then what you do the secret of

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:53.740 
that and then what you do the secret of
this<00:01:51.500> is<00:01:51.710> to<00:01:51.890> try<00:01:52.070> to<00:01:52.130> keep<00:01:52.370> them<00:01:52.580> tight<00:01:52.850> so<00:01:53.210> you

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
this is to try to keep them tight so you

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.170 
this is to try to keep them tight so you
come<00:01:54.020> back<00:01:54.230> up<00:01:54.290> between<00:01:54.950> the<00:01:55.280> between<00:01:55.910> the

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:56.180 
come back up between the between the

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:01.330 
come back up between the between the
beads<00:01:56.540> on<00:01:57.940> the<00:01:58.940> back<00:01:59.150> end<00:01:59.570> and<00:01:59.930> you<00:02:00.830> secure

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340 
beads on the back end and you secure

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:02.650 
beads on the back end and you secure
them<00:02:01.640> to<00:02:01.820> the<00:02:01.850> beads<00:02:02.150> that<00:02:02.270> are<00:02:02.360> already

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:02.660 
them to the beads that are already

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:09.160 
them to the beads that are already
secured<00:02:04.780> and<00:02:06.460> they're<00:02:07.460> tight<00:02:07.790> now<00:02:08.020> then<00:02:09.020> you

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
secured and they're tight now then you

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:11.710 
secured and they're tight now then you
go<00:02:09.290> back<00:02:09.530> every<00:02:10.100> second<00:02:10.760> bead<00:02:10.970> you<00:02:11.180> go<00:02:11.300> do<00:02:11.480> you

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
go back every second bead you go do you

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.070 
go back every second bead you go do you
you<00:02:11.930> secure<00:02:12.350> every<00:02:12.710> second<00:02:13.130> bead<00:02:13.570> to<00:02:14.570> the

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
you secure every second bead to the

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.480 
you secure every second bead to the
beads<00:02:16.010> that<00:02:16.160> have<00:02:16.460> already<00:02:16.670> been<00:02:17.150> sewn<00:02:17.990> on

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:18.490 
beads that have already been sewn on

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:21.790 
beads that have already been sewn on
there<00:02:19.490> now<00:02:19.970> they're<00:02:20.180> tight<00:02:20.480> these<00:02:21.290> beads<00:02:21.620> are

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
there now they're tight these beads are

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.910 
there now they're tight these beads are
tight<00:02:22.100> now<00:02:22.370> they<00:02:23.240> will<00:02:23.390> not<00:02:23.600> move<00:02:23.840> so<00:02:24.170> then

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
tight now they will not move so then

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.590 
tight now they will not move so then
when<00:02:25.130> you<00:02:25.220> want<00:02:25.430> to<00:02:25.490> go<00:02:25.640> back<00:02:25.850> up<00:02:26.060> and<00:02:26.210> add<00:02:26.360> more

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:26.600 
when you want to go back up and add more

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.100 
when you want to go back up and add more
beads<00:02:26.870> you<00:02:27.860> go<00:02:28.040> up<00:02:28.330> and<00:02:29.330> you<00:02:29.450> slide<00:02:29.690> your

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
beads you go up and you slide your

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:34.180 
beads you go up and you slide your
needle<00:02:30.290> through<00:02:30.860> the<00:02:30.890> last<00:02:31.520> bead<00:02:32.530> on<00:02:33.530> your

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
needle through the last bead on your

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:39.729 
needle through the last bead on your
design<00:02:36.820> like<00:02:37.820> this<00:02:38.090> and<00:02:38.540> then<00:02:38.989> you<00:02:39.080> add<00:02:39.260> more

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:39.739 
design like this and then you add more

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:53.870 
design like this and then you add more
beads<00:02:40.840> preferably<00:02:41.840> for

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:03:01.640 

this<00:02:54.880> is<00:02:55.030> a<00:02:55.060> very<00:02:55.450> old<00:02:56.610> traditional<00:02:57.610> cultural

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.949 

design<00:03:02.910> there<00:03:03.910> we<00:03:04.000> go<00:03:04.120> for<00:03:04.390> more<00:03:04.420> beads<00:03:04.780> have

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:04.959 
design there we go for more beads have

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:07.140 
design there we go for more beads have
been<00:03:05.110> added<00:03:05.560> and<00:03:05.709> I'm<00:03:05.890> going<00:03:06.489> to<00:03:06.610> make<00:03:07.120> a

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
been added and I'm going to make a

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.660 
been added and I'm going to make a
circle<00:03:07.720> around<00:03:07.840> this<00:03:08.319> this<00:03:09.160> because<00:03:09.430> this<00:03:09.580> is

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
circle around this this because this is

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:12.240 
circle around this this because this is
gonna<00:03:09.819> be<00:03:10.090> a<00:03:10.120> bud<00:03:10.420> so<00:03:10.810> it's<00:03:10.989> gonna<00:03:11.110> be<00:03:11.380> it's

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250 
gonna be a bud so it's gonna be it's

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:18.120 
gonna be a bud so it's gonna be it's
gonna<00:03:12.459> be<00:03:12.810> brought<00:03:13.810> around<00:03:14.310> like<00:03:15.310> this<00:03:17.130> now

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:18.130 
gonna be brought around like this now

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:20.670 
gonna be brought around like this now
we're<00:03:18.280> going<00:03:18.459> to<00:03:18.550> go<00:03:19.030> back<00:03:19.239> to<00:03:19.630> this<00:03:19.750> second

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 
we're going to go back to this second

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:21.449 
we're going to go back to this second
bead

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:21.459 
bead

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:30.750 
bead
I<00:03:24.299> wanna<00:03:25.299> secure<00:03:25.810> it<00:03:25.989> there<00:03:29.069> keep<00:03:30.069> it<00:03:30.250> forming

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760 
I wanna secure it there keep it forming

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.090 
I wanna secure it there keep it forming
around<00:03:30.850> sometimes<00:03:31.690> it'll<00:03:31.959> you're<00:03:32.440> you<00:03:32.890> better

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:33.100 
around sometimes it'll you're you better

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:34.710 
around sometimes it'll you're you better
watch<00:03:33.340> your<00:03:33.549> thread<00:03:33.850> to<00:03:34.000> make<00:03:34.150> sure<00:03:34.330> that<00:03:34.480> your

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 
watch your thread to make sure that your

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:38.309 
watch your thread to make sure that your
thread<00:03:35.019> stays<00:03:36.480> to<00:03:37.480> where<00:03:37.660> you<00:03:37.750> want<00:03:38.049> it<00:03:38.230> to

00:03:38.309 --> 00:03:38.319 
thread stays to where you want it to

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:39.630 
thread stays to where you want it to
stay<00:03:38.530> and<00:03:38.739> that's<00:03:38.830> where<00:03:39.130> you<00:03:39.220> use<00:03:39.250> your

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:39.640 
stay and that's where you use your

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:48.059 
stay and that's where you use your
fingers<00:03:40.920> there<00:03:46.260> keep<00:03:47.260> it<00:03:47.410> tight

00:03:48.059 --> 00:03:48.069 
fingers there keep it tight

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:50.940 
fingers there keep it tight
that's<00:03:48.640> the<00:03:48.880> secret<00:03:49.150> to<00:03:49.390> make<00:03:49.690> sure<00:03:49.930> keep<00:03:50.769> your

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:50.950 
that's the secret to make sure keep your

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:55.470 
that's the secret to make sure keep your
beads<00:03:51.190> very<00:03:51.610> tight<00:03:52.000> there<00:03:52.810> you<00:03:53.549> go<00:03:54.549> up<00:03:54.760> again

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:55.480 
beads very tight there you go up again

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:59.000 
beads very tight there you go up again
back<00:03:56.260> to<00:03:56.500> the<00:03:56.590> last<00:03:56.859> bead<00:03:57.700> that<00:03:57.970> we<00:03:58.030> stopped<00:03:58.600> at

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
back to the last bead that we stopped at

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:02.060 
back to the last bead that we stopped at
I'm<00:04:00.010> gonna<00:04:00.190> pass<00:04:00.609> the<00:04:00.970> thread<00:04:01.299> through<00:04:01.329> the

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:02.070 
I'm gonna pass the thread through the

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:05.849 
I'm gonna pass the thread through the
bead<00:04:03.070> if<00:04:03.250> it<00:04:03.400> will<00:04:03.579> negotiate<00:04:04.620> sometimes<00:04:05.620> the

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:05.859 
bead if it will negotiate sometimes the

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:09.509 
bead if it will negotiate sometimes the
beads<00:04:06.069> are<00:04:06.250> small<00:04:07.109> so<00:04:08.109> what<00:04:08.319> we<00:04:08.470> can<00:04:08.739> do<00:04:08.950> is<00:04:09.310> we

00:04:09.509 --> 00:04:09.519 
beads are small so what we can do is we

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:13.040 
beads are small so what we can do is we
can<00:04:09.640> start<00:04:09.970> from<00:04:10.209> the<00:04:10.390> other<00:04:10.480> end

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:13.050 

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:21.910 

oh<00:04:14.520> it<00:04:14.910> won't<00:04:15.150> so<00:04:16.640> just<00:04:17.640> go<00:04:17.790> down<00:04:17.970> a

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:21.920 

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:29.420 

different<00:04:22.920> color<00:04:25.190> which<00:04:26.190> is<00:04:26.250> we<00:04:27.180> have<00:04:28.430> so

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:29.430 
different color which is we have so

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:34.310 
different color which is we have so
let's<00:04:29.670> look<00:04:29.850> at<00:04:30.030> some<00:04:30.240> points<00:04:30.630> I<00:04:33.020> always<00:04:34.020> use<00:04:34.290> a

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:34.320 
let's look at some points I always use a

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:35.990 
let's look at some points I always use a
little<00:04:34.410> casement<00:04:35.130> for<00:04:35.250> my<00:04:35.370> beads<00:04:35.730> that<00:04:35.940> are

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.000 
little casement for my beads that are

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.130 
little casement for my beads that are
all<00:04:36.270> around<00:04:38.420> pink<00:04:39.420> is<00:04:39.570> a<00:04:39.600> very<00:04:39.870> traditional

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:40.140 
all around pink is a very traditional

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:48.430 
all around pink is a very traditional
color<00:04:44.090> they<00:04:45.090> used<00:04:45.330> to<00:04:45.480> trade<00:04:45.750> their<00:04:45.960> beads

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:48.440 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:55.360 

with<00:04:49.440> different<00:04:51.050> animals<00:04:52.050> in<00:04:52.520> the<00:04:53.520> old<00:04:54.150> days

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:55.370 
with different animals in the old days

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:58.520 
with different animals in the old days
and<00:04:56.370> the<00:04:57.000> women<00:04:57.300> would<00:04:57.480> be<00:04:57.630> would<00:04:58.080> be<00:04:58.260> in<00:04:58.440> the

wagering and that would give them some

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.760 
wagering and that would give them some

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:14.480 
there's four beats sick here that down

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:18.350 
there's four beats sick here that down
like<00:05:15.480> that<00:05:15.950> and<00:05:16.950> now<00:05:17.220> we<00:05:17.280> have<00:05:17.700> to<00:05:17.850> make<00:05:18.030> sure

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:18.360 
like that and now we have to make sure

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:24.620 
like that and now we have to make sure
that<00:05:18.960> we<00:05:21.320> keep<00:05:22.320> them<00:05:22.650> tight<00:05:22.950> to<00:05:23.419> the<00:05:24.419> flower

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:24.630 
that we keep them tight to the flower

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:39.870 
that we keep them tight to the flower
but<00:05:28.010> the<00:05:29.010> second<00:05:29.430> bead

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:39.880 

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:43.840 

that's<00:05:40.880> how<00:05:41.060> we<00:05:41.120> do<00:05:41.330> it<00:05:42.370> let<00:05:43.370> me<00:05:43.460> just<00:05:43.700> keep

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:43.850 
that's how we do it let me just keep

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:47.230 
that's how we do it let me just keep
going<00:05:44.360> along<00:05:44.600> and<00:05:45.050> some<00:05:46.040> people<00:05:46.460> like<00:05:46.850> to<00:05:46.880> make

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:47.240 
going along and some people like to make

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:49.300 
going along and some people like to make
a<00:05:47.300> pattern<00:05:47.780> and<00:05:48.260> draw<00:05:48.500> off<00:05:48.650> in<00:05:48.770> the<00:05:48.890> pattern

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:49.310 
a pattern and draw off in the pattern

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:51.970 
a pattern and draw off in the pattern
which<00:05:49.490> is<00:05:49.670> fine<00:05:49.970> I<00:05:50.330> on<00:05:51.200> the<00:05:51.320> other<00:05:51.350> hand<00:05:51.530> just

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:51.980 
which is fine I on the other hand just

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:55.300 
which is fine I on the other hand just
keep<00:05:52.280> going<00:05:52.820> and<00:05:53.440> creating<00:05:54.440> my<00:05:54.590> design<00:05:54.980> as<00:05:55.190> I

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:55.310 
keep going and creating my design as I

00:05:55.310 --> 00:06:19.930 
keep going and creating my design as I
go<00:06:04.030> three<00:06:13.930> sure<00:06:14.930> they<00:06:15.080> hook<00:06:15.320> up<00:06:15.560> tight<00:06:15.950> me<00:06:18.940> do

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:19.940 
go three sure they hook up tight me do

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:27.070 
go three sure they hook up tight me do
it<00:06:21.100> no<00:06:22.510> go<00:06:23.510> up<00:06:23.570> to<00:06:23.690> the<00:06:23.780> second<00:06:24.170> bead<00:06:25.930> secure<00:06:26.930> it

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:27.080 
it no go up to the second bead secure it

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:28.960 
it no go up to the second bead secure it
to<00:06:27.290> the<00:06:27.440> already<00:06:27.740> existing<00:06:27.980> beads<00:06:28.640> that<00:06:28.850> are

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:28.970 
to the already existing beads that are

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:43.269 
to the already existing beads that are
already<00:06:29.240> been<00:06:29.510> secured

00:06:43.269 --> 00:06:43.279 

00:06:43.279 --> 00:06:48.379 

and<00:06:44.279> that's<00:06:44.430> it<00:06:44.669> and<00:06:46.370> that's<00:06:47.370> all<00:06:47.610> that's<00:06:48.180> what
