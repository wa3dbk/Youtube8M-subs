00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.349
 dual sim and in 3g 

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:29.490
 as we can see it comes with the box 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.860
 traditional and always the same 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.890
 structure and here we have at the end 

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:36.740
 2006 240 in orange launches pretty 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.670

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:46.500
 by the way generous of 2 thousand 500 thousand 

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:46.500
 empires 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:54.280
 a first guide and a solution 

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:01.260
 and finally we found the charger 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:14.240
 here as you can see the case is 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:15.950
 lighter orange on the back and 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.530
 the edge with rounded corners 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:21.310
 It has a stronger orange than you 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.310
 teach a little now 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.740
 you can see the different edges 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:31.480
 and as you can see they have the button 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:33.680
 galán gives us the ignition time of 

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:37.640
 those of volume 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:39.950
 here we have the voice the 8 camera 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.990
 megapixels with led flash and in the part 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:44.330
 front we have the screen the 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:46.160
 buttons are behind the screen we have 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:48.170
 the front camera and this band is 5 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:50.410
 inches with a resolution of 1280 x 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.410
 720 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:56.280
 now let's put the battery and 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:56.280
 we managed to turn on for the first time 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:15.219
 every 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.930

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:29.270
 we can also see that at first sight 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:33.040
 the speaker is quite large and 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:33.040
 we hope it will be quite powerful 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:40.410
 and now we re -assemble 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:40.410
 and we can turn it on 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:53.540

 or without hertz is landrón 400 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:31.730
