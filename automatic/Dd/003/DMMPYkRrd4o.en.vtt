00:00:09.367 --> 00:00:12.197
 You're thinking of moving to Mars. 

00:00:12.197 --> 00:00:15.978
 Have you chosen a location for your new home? 

00:00:15.978 --> 00:00:19.164
 No? If I'm here to help you. 

00:00:19.164 --> 00:00:20.488
 Most importantly, 

00:00:20.488 --> 00:00:23.883
 Here are some things you'll need to bring to the Red Planet: 

00:00:23.883 --> 00:00:29.320
 Severe tolerance to cold, loneliness, and radioactivity; 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:32.938
 Life-long supply of breathable air and food; 

00:00:32.938 --> 00:00:35.321
 And a multibillion-dollar spacecraft; 

00:00:35.321 --> 00:00:37.927
 And a desire to stay away from everything; 

00:00:37.927 --> 00:00:39.367
 And water. 

00:00:39.367 --> 00:00:43.642
 You will definitely need water. 

00:00:43.642 --> 00:00:46.182
 So what kind of property are you looking for? 

00:00:46.182 --> 00:00:50.051
 What do you think of the mansion in the labyrinth "nukes labyrinth"? 

00:00:50.051 --> 00:00:52.687
 Or a secluded haven in the "laughing face" pit? 

00:00:52.687 --> 00:00:56.225
 Or in a castle on the plateau "Elvis Mesa"? 

00:00:56.225 --> 00:00:57.958
 Want a view of the ocean? 

00:00:57.958 --> 00:01:00.788
 Uh, unfortunately I have bad news about this last choice. 

00:01:00.788 --> 00:01:04.311
 It has been delayed nearly 4 billion years. 

00:01:04.311 --> 00:01:07.948
 We are absolutely confident that Mars was carrying oceans, lakes and rivers, 

00:01:07.948 --> 00:01:09.970
 Complete water bodies collection. 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:13.695
 But over time, almost all are frozen under the surface of the planet, 

00:01:13.695 --> 00:01:16.582
 Or evaporation in space. 

00:01:16.582 --> 00:01:19.182
 But it is likely that there is still some water under 

00:01:19.182 --> 00:01:25.062
 Carbon dioxide sheets that expand and contract seasonally 

00:01:25.062 --> 00:01:29.337
 So what would Mars look like today if it had surface water? 

00:01:29.337 --> 00:01:32.131
 This of course depends on the amount of water we are talking about. 

00:01:32.131 --> 00:01:34.573
 Anyway it might look like this: 

00:01:34.573 --> 00:01:39.064
 The northern half of the relatively flat planet is below the planet's average height, 

00:01:39.064 --> 00:01:41.666
 So it would become a huge one. 

00:01:41.666 --> 00:01:43.562
 While the southern half is covered with drilling 

00:01:43.562 --> 00:01:47.089
 Remains mostly high and dry. 

00:01:47.089 --> 00:01:50.497
 This difference between the two halves of the planet seems a bit catastrophic, 

00:01:50.497 --> 00:01:52.650
 We do not know why this is the case. 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:55.101
 It is likely that the southern half is much older, 

00:01:55.101 --> 00:01:57.432
 Taking into account the number of holes, 

00:01:57.432 --> 00:02:02.756
 And evidence of increased volcanic activity in the north. 

00:02:02.756 --> 00:02:04.140
 Well, who knows? 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.842
 There may be oceans once again on Mars one day, 

00:02:06.842 --> 00:02:11.749
 Now, it is a huge dusty desert. 

00:02:11.749 --> 00:02:14.611
 In fact, it is much like the deserts on earth, 

00:02:14.611 --> 00:02:19.239
 So much so that we can learn a lot about Mars by our planet. 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:22.321
 For example, the sand dunes on Mars form and act 

00:02:22.321 --> 00:02:24.663
 Such as the sand dunes on Earth, 

00:02:24.663 --> 00:02:28.007
 However, the Martian densities are often twice the size of that earth, 

00:02:28.007 --> 00:02:33.306
 This is due to the force of gravity, which is one third of the earth's gravity. 

00:02:33.306 --> 00:02:36.227
 Mars also has some terrain that you will not see on Earth. 

00:02:36.227 --> 00:02:41.363
 Such as "Tars", sand dunes with no peaks, up to 15 meters high. 

00:02:41.363 --> 00:02:44.803
 We do not yet understand its compositions. 

00:02:44.803 --> 00:02:46.057
 You must be wondering. 

00:02:46.057 --> 00:02:48.819
 "What would be the result of mixing a desert on a planet 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:51.064
 A climate like our climate, 

00:02:51.064 --> 00:02:56.493
 Subject to wind-generated pressure groups, sandstorms? " 

00:02:56.493 --> 00:02:59.422
 These will be your major natural disasters on the Red Planet. 

00:02:59.422 --> 00:03:02.240
 They play a big role in making the planet red 

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:07.644
 By spreading rusty iron particles on the planet's surface and in the air. 

00:03:07.644 --> 00:03:09.920
 Because of its low gravity and low humidity, 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:14.964
 These sandstorms may last for months and cover the planet. 

00:03:14.964 --> 00:03:19.779
 So, it may be best to build your home on the highest possible height. 

00:03:19.779 --> 00:03:21.481
 Well, do not look anymore. 

00:03:21.481 --> 00:03:27.195
 Here is Olympus Mons, the largest volcano in the solar system. 

00:03:27.195 --> 00:03:29.323
 Even though Mars has a breathable air. 

00:03:29.323 --> 00:03:34.556
 You will see that the view from its summit of up to 25 km breathtaking. 

00:03:34.556 --> 00:03:36.163
 Or do not you like volcanoes? 

00:03:36.163 --> 00:03:41.919
 So what do you think of Waltz Marineres, the largest wadi in the solar system? 

00:03:41.919 --> 00:03:44.061
 It is so wide that you stand at one end 

00:03:44.061 --> 00:03:48.182
 The other edge will be under the horizon curve. 

00:03:48.182 --> 00:03:53.694
 However, you will see a magnificent blue sunset in a typically red sky 

00:03:53.694 --> 00:03:57.136
 Which derives its color from the dust that absorbs most of the blue light, 

00:03:57.136 --> 00:04:01.630
 And because of the fragmentation of the atmosphere of sunlight. 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:06.482
 Do you have the determination and curiosity, or are you just looking for a chance? 

00:04:06.482 --> 00:04:10.908
 If you stop procrastinating and go to Mars today! 

00:04:10.908 --> 00:04:14.215
 Mars: Redder than ever.
