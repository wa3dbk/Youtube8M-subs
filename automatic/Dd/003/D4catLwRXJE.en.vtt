00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:07.130
 powerful browser with you 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.130
 lucy browser 

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:14.580
 do not 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:17.730
 two 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.910
 surf the internet from our 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.220
 smartphone is one of the most 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.869
 common today although reality 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.640
 is that most of the time we use 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.050
 pre-installed browsers though 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.940
 these are not exactly the best 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.370
 option is why we want 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.780
 introduce you ius and browser a browser 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.670
 designed in asia that has 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.110
 interesting features and functions 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.900
 that make it an excellent 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.550
 option to prove cataloged as one 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:49.260
 of the fastest mobile browsers 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.699
 that exist and a browser does not 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.739
 will disappoint since it has 

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:53.940
 support servers that allow a 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.519
 faster browsing speed 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.960
 besides that it compresses the data to 

00:00:56.519 --> 00:01:01.320
 save us megabytes in our balance or 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.699
 of our plan with 3g or 4g plus the 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.500
 videos and web pages load 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.600
 substantially faster with joost and 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.190
 browser as in this test where 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.440
 both smartphones have opened the same 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:12.479
 website both connected to it 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.280
 wifi signal with the same speed of 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.759
 connection but that thanks to just and 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.890
 browser 

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:19.340
 elop or r5 beats engine g with chrome 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.659
 in opening a news page first 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.640
 but they and browser is much more than 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.350
 simple speed since it has a 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.670
 extensive list of benefits among 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.170
 which includes the possibility of 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.360
 customize our home page 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.950
 with the content that interests us most 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.080
 either organizing the pre-links 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.400
 loaded or adding new ones too 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.200
 we found the possibility to add 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.670
 tools and content pages 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.650
 in addition to called extensions 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.780
 add-ons that work like mini 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.520
 apps entered the same browser for another 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.990
 side and use browser is highly 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.570
 configurable and its settings menu 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.280
 includes control over images size and 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.430
 Font font brightness adjustment 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.870
 Content preloading is a forced 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.060
 as several options that make us the 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:58.770
 easier life when browsing the internet and 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.530
 thus improving our experience 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.119
 navigation through the smartphone 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.290
 josh and browser also incorporates themes and 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.060
 wallpapers with which we can 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.220
 customize our browser even more 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.810
 either by selecting the catalog in 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.970
 line or directly from our 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.860
 photos also has a manager 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.230
 downloads that allows you to keep up to 6 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.700
 downloads online and if that was not enough and 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.770
 a if the browser also has a 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.510
 mini version which has been programmed 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:24.720
 especially for range devices 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:26.970
 low as in this case with a 7 x 2 max 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.650
 that only has 512 mb of memory 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.810
 ram so the browsers 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.970
 traditional are usually slower 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.830
 but with browser navigation 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.600
 It is fluid and agile as you can 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.610
 appreciate when opening power pda point 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:41.310
 our news site which is 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:43.170
 something heavy but wait we still have more 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.000
 for you and is that giusti browser also 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.730
 is available for computers and for 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.440
 ios devices like your ipad in fact 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.240
 according to the official site of yuso and 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.420
 browser the browser has versions 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:55.650
 special for iphone ipad android 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.480
 computers and mobile devices with 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:59.370
 windows as well as a version for 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:02.280
 symbian equipment and for devices not 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:04.290
 smartphones entails in summary we are 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.420
 before a very complete browser that 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.040
 step is completely free and that counts 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.990
 with added value options that 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.760
 position side by side and even by 

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:14.280
 over with the most popular browsers 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.290
 that we all know either by their 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.060
 hardware acceleration or by cloud its 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:20.100
 integrated download manager 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.870
 multiple customization options or 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:23.610
 the possibilities of expanding functions 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:25.680
 through extensions and complements 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:27.540
 additional the reality is that I am 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.950
