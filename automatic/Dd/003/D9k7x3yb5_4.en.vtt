sinner punch and pop right in the center

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.980 
sinner punch and pop right in the center
of<00:01:14.549> where<00:01:14.760> the<00:01:14.880> pins<00:01:15.360> where<00:01:15.570> you'll<00:01:15.750> see<00:01:15.900> we

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
of where the pins where you'll see we

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.830 
of where the pins where you'll see we
broke<00:01:16.530> off<00:01:16.740> in<00:01:16.950> there<00:01:17.130> and<00:01:17.310> then<00:01:17.970> just<00:01:18.000> drill

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
broke off in there and then just drill

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.140 
broke off in there and then just drill
completely<00:01:19.320> through<00:01:19.619> the<00:01:20.369> hardware<00:01:20.850> is

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
completely through the hardware is

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.200 
completely through the hardware is
really<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.720> easiest<00:01:22.020> way<00:01:22.850> okay<00:01:23.850> at<00:01:24.060> that

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
really the easiest way okay at that

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.580 
really the easiest way okay at that
point<00:01:24.479> you<00:01:24.689> want<00:01:24.810> something<00:01:25.110> to<00:01:25.200> shear<00:01:25.409> off

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
point you want something to shear off

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.859 
point you want something to shear off
and<00:01:25.799> you<00:01:25.860> go<00:01:25.979> back<00:01:26.189> in<00:01:26.520> so<00:01:27.450> at<00:01:27.509> that<00:01:27.630> point

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
and you go back in so at that point

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.390 
and you go back in so at that point
would<00:01:28.170> recommend<00:01:28.680> is<00:01:28.770> some<00:01:28.950> kind<00:01:29.159> of<00:01:29.250> a

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
would recommend is some kind of a

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.890 
would recommend is some kind of a
plastic<00:01:31.340> dowel<00:01:32.340> that<00:01:32.670> will<00:01:32.850> work<00:01:33.060> this<00:01:33.750> one

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
plastic dowel that will work this one

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.170 
plastic dowel that will work this one
fits<00:01:34.110> really<00:01:34.290> tight<00:01:34.409> for<00:01:35.369> what<00:01:35.490> we<00:01:35.610> found<00:01:35.850> and

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
fits really tight for what we found and

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.630 
fits really tight for what we found and
it<00:01:36.600> usually<00:01:36.840> is<00:01:37.170> a<00:01:37.200> plastic<00:01:38.130> toothpick<00:01:38.310> or

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
it usually is a plastic toothpick or

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.700 
it usually is a plastic toothpick or
something<00:01:38.939> that<00:01:39.060> nature<00:01:39.420> you<00:01:40.200> know<00:01:40.290> obviously

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
something that nature you know obviously

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.830 
something that nature you know obviously
that's<00:01:40.829> way<00:01:41.189> long<00:01:41.610> but<00:01:42.270> that<00:01:42.390> gives<00:01:42.509> you<00:01:42.600> since

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
that's way long but that gives you since

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.060 
that's way long but that gives you since
that's<00:01:42.990> in<00:01:43.079> there<00:01:43.200> nice<00:01:43.350> and<00:01:43.380> tight<00:01:43.619> you<00:01:43.770> want

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
that's in there nice and tight you want

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.620 
that's in there nice and tight you want
that<00:01:44.189> to<00:01:44.310> shear<00:01:44.549> off<00:01:44.759> but<00:01:45.119> you<00:01:45.210> want<00:01:45.390> to<00:01:45.450> hold

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
that to shear off but you want to hold

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.179 
that to shear off but you want to hold
the<00:01:45.810> gear<00:01:45.960> in<00:01:46.110> place<00:01:46.140> while<00:01:46.619> you<00:01:46.799> have<00:01:46.979> it<00:01:47.100> the

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
the gear in place while you have it the

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.039 
the gear in place while you have it the
car<00:01:47.430> until<00:01:47.640> you<00:01:47.729> need<00:01:47.880> it<00:01:48.030> you<00:01:48.600> don't<00:01:48.630> want<00:01:48.990> to

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
car until you need it you don't want to

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.929 
car until you need it you don't want to
use<00:01:49.140> something<00:01:49.350> that's<00:01:49.470> wooden<00:01:49.979> or<00:01:50.700> something

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
use something that's wooden or something

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.490 
use something that's wooden or something
like<00:01:51.030> that<00:01:51.240> it's<00:01:51.450> just<00:01:51.570> going<00:01:51.659> to<00:01:51.750> cause

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
like that it's just going to cause

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:53.660 
like that it's just going to cause
problems<00:01:52.710> I<00:01:52.950> don't<00:01:53.040> even<00:01:53.280> have<00:01:53.369> a<00:01:53.399> seatbelt

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
problems I don't even have a seatbelt

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.280 
problems I don't even have a seatbelt
repair<00:01:54.180> later<00:01:54.420> and<00:01:54.659> it<00:01:54.720> could<00:01:54.810> be<00:01:54.899> noise<00:01:55.079> in

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
repair later and it could be noise in

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.620 
repair later and it could be noise in
there<00:01:55.500> I<00:01:55.680> hear<00:01:56.219> some<00:01:56.430> people<00:01:56.460> using<00:01:56.939> out<00:01:57.149> some

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
there I hear some people using out some

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.240 
there I hear some people using out some
welding<00:01:57.990> rod<00:01:58.259> or<00:01:58.500> something<00:01:58.770> that<00:01:58.890> nature<00:01:59.219> I

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
welding rod or something that nature I

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.370 
welding rod or something that nature I
don't<00:01:59.549> know<00:01:59.759> how<00:02:00.090> brittle<00:02:00.390> that<00:02:00.630> would<00:02:00.750> be<00:02:00.899> you

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
don't know how brittle that would be you

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:02.510 
don't know how brittle that would be you
definitely<00:02:01.799> make<00:02:01.890> sure<00:02:01.920> this<00:02:02.100> could<00:02:02.280> shear

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
definitely make sure this could shear

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.179 
definitely make sure this could shear
off<00:02:02.570> so<00:02:03.570> after<00:02:03.810> you<00:02:03.899> have<00:02:03.930> that<00:02:04.290> cut<00:02:04.920> you<00:02:05.070> some

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
off so after you have that cut you some

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:08.770 
off so after you have that cut you some
small<00:02:05.340> pieces<00:02:06.229> and<00:02:07.229> stick<00:02:07.530> it<00:02:07.619> inside<00:02:07.770> your

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
small pieces and stick it inside your

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:12.050 
small pieces and stick it inside your
your<00:02:09.780> gear<00:02:10.020> assembly<00:02:10.289> and<00:02:10.860> you<00:02:11.550> get<00:02:11.760> a<00:02:11.790> sense

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
your gear assembly and you get a sense

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.640 
your gear assembly and you get a sense
of<00:02:12.209> how<00:02:12.330> that's<00:02:12.450> going<00:02:12.629> to<00:02:12.690> be<00:02:12.780> okay

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
of how that's going to be okay

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.830 
of how that's going to be okay
at<00:02:14.220> this<00:02:14.459> point<00:02:14.700> you<00:02:15.150> can<00:02:15.299> see<00:02:15.510> these<00:02:15.629> would

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
at this point you can see these would

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.800 
at this point you can see these would
line<00:02:16.079> up<00:02:16.819> with<00:02:17.819> the<00:02:17.939> holes<00:02:18.150> you<00:02:18.299> got<00:02:18.480> drilled

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
line up with the holes you got drilled

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:25.280 
line up with the holes you got drilled
in<00:02:19.560> your<00:02:19.739> hardware<00:02:22.459> like<00:02:23.459> that<00:02:23.930> so<00:02:24.930> I<00:02:24.959> can<00:02:25.140> hold

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
in your hardware like that so I can hold

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.979 
in your hardware like that so I can hold
it<00:02:25.409> you<00:02:25.560> can<00:02:25.709> see<00:02:25.980> it<00:02:26.510> so<00:02:27.510> you<00:02:27.599> can<00:02:27.720> see<00:02:27.870> the

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:27.989 
it you can see it so you can see the

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:29.750 
it you can see it so you can see the
dowser<00:02:28.200> in<00:02:28.439> there<00:02:28.620> you<00:02:29.069> could<00:02:29.220> push<00:02:29.400> this<00:02:29.549> all

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
dowser in there you could push this all

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.069 
dowser in there you could push this all
the<00:02:29.849> way<00:02:29.939> through<00:02:29.970> and<00:02:30.390> you<00:02:30.420> want<00:02:30.629> to<00:02:30.689> be<00:02:30.810> tight

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:31.079 
the way through and you want to be tight

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:32.780 
the way through and you want to be tight
and<00:02:31.290> you<00:02:31.769> can<00:02:31.890> see<00:02:32.010> they<00:02:32.129> pop<00:02:32.340> out<00:02:32.519> the<00:02:32.640> other

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
and you can see they pop out the other

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.119 
and you can see they pop out the other
side<00:02:33.000> and<00:02:33.390> then<00:02:33.959> you'd<00:02:34.230> probably<00:02:34.409> match<00:02:34.829> that

00:02:35.119 --> 00:02:35.129 
side and then you'd probably match that

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:36.410 
side and then you'd probably match that
you<00:02:35.280> may<00:02:35.400> want<00:02:35.579> to<00:02:35.609> put<00:02:35.760> some<00:02:35.909> silicone<00:02:36.120> or

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
you may want to put some silicone or

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:37.550 
you may want to put some silicone or
simple<00:02:36.720> on<00:02:36.780> something<00:02:37.079> like<00:02:37.140> that<00:02:37.200> just<00:02:37.379> to

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
simple on something like that just to

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:38.960 
simple on something like that just to
make<00:02:37.650> sure<00:02:37.709> it's<00:02:37.920> in<00:02:38.010> there<00:02:38.159> let's<00:02:38.700> go<00:02:38.790> hold

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
make sure it's in there let's go hold

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:40.849 
make sure it's in there let's go hold
that<00:02:39.120> gear<00:02:39.329> nice<00:02:39.540> and<00:02:39.780> taut<00:02:39.959> and<00:02:40.439> you<00:02:40.590> can't

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:40.859 
that gear nice and taut and you can't

00:02:40.859 --> 00:02:43.369 
that gear nice and taut and you can't
put<00:02:41.099> the<00:02:41.220> gear<00:02:41.430> in<00:02:41.459> at<00:02:41.670> this<00:02:41.819> point<00:02:42.209> because<00:02:43.140> it

00:02:43.369 --> 00:02:43.379 
put the gear in at this point because it

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:45.199 
put the gear in at this point because it
has<00:02:43.739> to<00:02:43.890> have<00:02:43.920> the<00:02:44.189> replacement<00:02:44.400> part<00:02:44.879> first

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
has to have the replacement part first

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:47.300 
has to have the replacement part first
so<00:02:46.139> I<00:02:46.170> just<00:02:46.500> want<00:02:46.620> to<00:02:46.709> show<00:02:46.799> you<00:02:46.859> how<00:02:47.010> to<00:02:47.069> get

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
so I just want to show you how to get

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.670 
so I just want to show you how to get
the<00:02:47.790> gear<00:02:48.000> will<00:02:48.269> hold<00:02:48.510> without<00:02:48.810> the<00:02:49.200> gear<00:02:49.440> your

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
the gear will hold without the gear your

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:50.899 
the gear will hold without the gear your
ball<00:02:49.859> bearings<00:02:50.250> are<00:02:50.340> going<00:02:50.489> to<00:02:50.549> fall<00:02:50.760> right

00:02:50.899 --> 00:02:50.909 
ball bearings are going to fall right

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:54.190 
ball bearings are going to fall right
back<00:02:50.970> out<00:02:51.329> of<00:02:51.359> your<00:02:51.540> new<00:02:51.629> hardware<00:02:52.049> okay<00:02:52.829> so

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
back out of your new hardware okay so

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.210 
back out of your new hardware okay so
also<00:02:55.200> one<00:02:55.500> thing<00:02:55.650> I<00:02:55.739> want<00:02:55.859> to<00:02:55.920> point<00:02:56.069> out

that in there that'll like I'll pull
that<00:03:16.739> together<00:03:17.040> as<00:03:17.310> well<00:03:17.489> this<00:03:18.389> has<00:03:18.599> to<00:03:18.629> go<00:03:18.810> in

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
that together as well this has to go in

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.930 
that together as well this has to go in
first<00:03:19.169> so<00:03:19.560> you're<00:03:20.340> going<00:03:20.459> to<00:03:20.519> have<00:03:20.639> a<00:03:20.669> new<00:03:20.849> one

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
first so you're going to have a new one

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:22.550 
first so you're going to have a new one
obviously<00:03:21.329> and<00:03:21.660> it's<00:03:22.019> going<00:03:22.109> to<00:03:22.169> have<00:03:22.319> ball

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
obviously and it's going to have ball

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:23.990 
obviously and it's going to have ball
bearings<00:03:22.590> in<00:03:23.010> there

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
bearings in there

00:03:29.089 --> 00:03:29.099 
right here use it as a pin or something

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:30.800 
right here use it as a pin or something
that'll<00:03:29.370> that'll<00:03:29.519> keep<00:03:30.060> your<00:03:30.239> ball<00:03:30.449> bearings

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
that'll that'll keep your ball bearings

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.770 
that'll that'll keep your ball bearings
up<00:03:31.349> inside<00:03:32.040> of<00:03:32.250> here<00:03:32.519> and<00:03:32.819> not<00:03:33.000> fall<00:03:33.299> out<00:03:33.329> here

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
up inside of here and not fall out here

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.149 
up inside of here and not fall out here
being<00:03:33.989> your<00:03:34.139> way<00:03:34.290> you're<00:03:34.590> going<00:03:34.739> to<00:03:34.769> need<00:03:34.949> that

00:03:35.149 --> 00:03:35.159 
being your way you're going to need that

00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:37.879 
being your way you're going to need that
to<00:03:35.430> stay<00:03:35.849> about<00:03:36.150> that<00:03:36.389> height<00:03:36.629> when<00:03:37.560> you<00:03:37.680> put

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:37.889 
to stay about that height when you put

00:03:37.889 --> 00:03:42.020 
to stay about that height when you put
the<00:03:38.040> gear<00:03:38.310> in<00:03:38.599> notice<00:03:39.599> these<00:03:39.780> gears<00:03:40.819> have<00:03:41.819> got

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
the gear in notice these gears have got

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:44.990 
the gear in notice these gears have got
different<00:03:42.419> spacing<00:03:42.870> on<00:03:42.959> the<00:03:42.989> sprockets<00:03:44.000> you

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
different spacing on the sprockets you

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.250 
different spacing on the sprockets you
got<00:03:45.180> to<00:03:45.359> get<00:03:45.479> a<00:03:45.510> real<00:03:45.690> close<00:03:45.870> together<00:03:46.169> here

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
got to get a real close together here

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.439 
got to get a real close together here
then<00:03:46.650> you<00:03:46.709> got<00:03:46.859> water<00:03:47.099> spacing<00:03:47.699> when<00:03:48.090> you<00:03:48.239> put

00:03:48.439 --> 00:03:48.449 
then you got water spacing when you put

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:49.930 
then you got water spacing when you put
these<00:03:48.569> dowels<00:03:48.870> in<00:03:49.139> they're<00:03:49.290> not<00:03:49.409> evenly

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:49.940 
these dowels in they're not evenly

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:52.189 
these dowels in they're not evenly
positioned<00:03:50.940> dowels<00:03:51.150> so<00:03:51.510> that's<00:03:51.840> going<00:03:51.959> to<00:03:52.019> put

00:03:52.189 --> 00:03:52.199 
positioned dowels so that's going to put

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:53.539 
positioned dowels so that's going to put
your<00:03:52.319> gear<00:03:52.470> in<00:03:52.590> the<00:03:52.650> right<00:03:52.799> place<00:03:53.129> with<00:03:53.430> the

00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:53.549 
your gear in the right place with the

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:59.089 
your gear in the right place with the
gear<00:03:54.090> will<00:03:54.959> slide<00:03:55.319> into<00:03:55.940> the<00:03:56.940> tubing<00:03:57.449> first<00:03:58.409> if

00:03:59.089 --> 00:03:59.099 
gear will slide into the tubing first if

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:01.129 
gear will slide into the tubing first if
you<00:03:59.310> took<00:03:59.489> that<00:03:59.669> if<00:03:59.819> you<00:03:59.970> put<00:04:00.180> in<00:04:00.329> with<00:04:01.019> the

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:01.139 
you took that if you put in with the

00:04:01.139 --> 00:04:03.080 
you took that if you put in with the
gear<00:04:01.319> you'll<00:04:01.470> never<00:04:01.680> get<00:04:01.859> this<00:04:01.979> in<00:04:02.159> there<00:04:02.370> so

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
gear you'll never get this in there so

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:06.409 
gear you'll never get this in there so
you<00:04:03.180> have<00:04:03.389> to<00:04:03.510> put<00:04:03.659> the<00:04:03.900> the<00:04:04.819> tubing<00:04:05.819> in<00:04:06.030> the

00:04:06.409 --> 00:04:06.419 
you have to put the the tubing in the

00:04:06.419 --> 00:04:09.289 
you have to put the the tubing in the
gear<00:04:06.690> assembly<00:04:07.229> together<00:04:08.000> that's<00:04:09.000> what's

00:04:09.289 --> 00:04:09.299 
gear assembly together that's what's

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:10.729 
gear assembly together that's what's
important<00:04:09.690> to<00:04:09.780> keep<00:04:09.930> this<00:04:10.079> right<00:04:10.290> here<00:04:10.590> and

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:10.739 
important to keep this right here and

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:13.099 
important to keep this right here and
keep<00:04:10.859> your<00:04:11.299> keep<00:04:12.299> your<00:04:12.329> ball<00:04:12.569> bearings<00:04:12.900> out<00:04:12.989> of

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:13.109 
keep your keep your ball bearings out of

00:04:13.109 --> 00:04:14.000 
keep your keep your ball bearings out of
your<00:04:13.199> way<00:04:13.319> okay

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.010 
your way okay

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:17.089 
your way okay
so<00:04:14.250> at<00:04:14.400> that<00:04:14.549> point<00:04:15.560> you<00:04:16.560> kind<00:04:16.709> of<00:04:16.799> see<00:04:16.979> what

00:04:17.089 --> 00:04:17.099 
so at that point you kind of see what

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:18.890 
so at that point you kind of see what
the<00:04:17.130> dials<00:04:17.430> are<00:04:17.489> going<00:04:17.609> to<00:04:17.669> be<00:04:17.820> work<00:04:18.539> your<00:04:18.690> gear

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:46.180 
if that pinhole right here is holding
your<00:04:45.260> ball<00:04:45.410> bearings<00:04:45.830> that's<00:04:45.980> where<00:04:46.100> they're

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:46.190 
your ball bearings that's where they're

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:47.230 
your ball bearings that's where they're
going<00:04:46.310> to<00:04:46.340> start<00:04:46.580> they're<00:04:46.790> going<00:04:46.910> to<00:04:46.970> see<00:04:47.090> that

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:47.240 
going to start they're going to see that

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:49.080 
going to start they're going to see that
they're<00:04:47.360> very<00:04:47.570> quickly<00:04:47.930> when<00:04:48.200> it<00:04:48.320> deploys<00:04:48.740> it

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:49.090 
they're very quickly when it deploys it

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:52.620 
they're very quickly when it deploys it
snapping<00:04:50.090> the<00:04:50.180> gear<00:04:50.330> down<00:04:50.510> tight<00:04:51.230> here<00:04:51.680> and

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:52.630 
snapping the gear down tight here and

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:55.090 
snapping the gear down tight here and
you<00:04:53.630> can<00:04:53.750> see<00:04:53.870> the<00:04:53.960> dowels<00:04:54.380> are<00:04:54.560> in<00:04:54.620> there<00:04:54.830> that

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:55.100 
you can see the dowels are in there that

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:57.490 
you can see the dowels are in there that
will<00:04:55.190> hold<00:04:55.370> it<00:04:55.460> together<00:04:55.610> it<00:04:56.360> is<00:04:56.540> without<00:04:57.350> it

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:57.500 
will hold it together it is without it

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:58.960 
will hold it together it is without it
being<00:04:57.680> the<00:04:58.040> easiest<00:04:58.310> trying<00:04:58.670> to<00:04:58.730> wiggle

00:04:58.960 --> 00:04:58.970 
being the easiest trying to wiggle

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:00.700 
being the easiest trying to wiggle
around<00:04:59.060> so<00:04:59.810> I<00:04:59.870> think<00:04:59.930> it<00:05:00.170> would<00:05:00.260> be<00:05:00.380> helpful<00:05:00.620> to

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:00.710 
around so I think it would be helpful to

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:02.260 
around so I think it would be helpful to
have<00:05:00.800> some<00:05:00.950> silicone<00:05:01.370> in<00:05:01.460> this<00:05:01.550> backside<00:05:02.000> back

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:02.270 
have some silicone in this backside back

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:04.540 
have some silicone in this backside back
here<00:05:02.570> and<00:05:02.780> then<00:05:03.290> I<00:05:03.470> would<00:05:03.530> definitely<00:05:03.950> want<00:05:04.400> to

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:04.550 
here and then I would definitely want to

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:07.180 
here and then I would definitely want to
have<00:05:05.060> these<00:05:05.720> sprockets<00:05:06.380> and<00:05:06.740> they're<00:05:06.830> really

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:07.190 
have these sprockets and they're really

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:10.120 
have these sprockets and they're really
nice<00:05:07.550> and<00:05:07.580> tight<00:05:08.530> and<00:05:09.530> at<00:05:09.650> this<00:05:09.800> point<00:05:10.040> you

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:10.130 
nice and tight and at this point you

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:12.460 
nice and tight and at this point you
start<00:05:10.400> reassembling<00:05:10.640> everything<00:05:11.390> if<00:05:12.290> you

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:12.470 
start reassembling everything if you

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:15.370 
start reassembling everything if you
have<00:05:12.500> a<00:05:13.570> dowel<00:05:14.570> or<00:05:14.750> something<00:05:14.990> here<00:05:15.140> you<00:05:15.170> want

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:15.380 
have a dowel or something here you want

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:16.870 
have a dowel or something here you want
to<00:05:15.410> snap<00:05:15.710> that<00:05:15.740> off<00:05:16.070> the<00:05:16.370> gear<00:05:16.580> is<00:05:16.670> going<00:05:16.790> to

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:16.880 
to snap that off the gear is going to

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:19.060 
to snap that off the gear is going to
hold<00:05:17.180> that<00:05:17.330> in<00:05:17.660> place<00:05:18.170> the<00:05:18.500> ball<00:05:18.650> bearings<00:05:18.950> be

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:19.070 
hold that in place the ball bearings be

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:20.380 
hold that in place the ball bearings be
right<00:05:19.250> there<00:05:19.460> so<00:05:19.640> when<00:05:19.760> it's<00:05:19.880> charge<00:05:20.150> goes

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:20.390 
right there so when it's charge goes

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:21.880 
right there so when it's charge goes
it's<00:05:20.570> going<00:05:20.690> to<00:05:20.780> insist<00:05:21.050> our<00:05:21.200> rotate<00:05:21.620> next

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:21.890 
it's going to insist our rotate next

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:24.190 
it's going to insist our rotate next
gear<00:05:22.100> I<00:05:22.310> hope<00:05:23.210> that<00:05:23.390> helps<00:05:23.690> explain<00:05:23.750> how<00:05:24.140> to

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:24.200 
gear I hope that helps explain how to

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:25.780 
gear I hope that helps explain how to
get<00:05:24.350> the<00:05:24.410> gears<00:05:24.770> back<00:05:25.010> in<00:05:25.250> there<00:05:25.430> we<00:05:25.520> get<00:05:25.610> a<00:05:25.670> lot

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:27.850 
get the gears back in there we get a lot
of<00:05:25.880> questions<00:05:26.300> about<00:05:26.390> that<00:05:26.540> will<00:05:27.470> show<00:05:27.680> other
