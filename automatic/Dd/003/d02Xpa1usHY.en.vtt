to<00:00:22.769> disasters<00:00:22.920> I<00:00:23.670> started<00:00:24.390> to<00:00:24.480> design<00:00:24.660> in<00:00:24.810> the

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
to disasters I started to design in the

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.339 
to disasters I started to design in the
XO<00:00:25.170> just<00:00:25.410> three<00:00:25.680> days<00:00:25.710> after<00:00:26.130> Katrina<00:00:27.230> one<00:00:28.230> of

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
the primary design objectives of the XO

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.350 
the primary design objectives of the XO
was<00:00:31.560> to<00:00:31.710> be<00:00:31.830> able<00:00:31.890> to<00:00:32.070> provide<00:00:32.219> a<00:00:32.430> secure<00:00:32.790> and

the<00:00:37.020> exhale<00:00:37.320> design<00:00:37.649> stems<00:00:38.010> from<00:00:38.129> our<00:00:38.280> very

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
the exhale design stems from our very

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.389 
the exhale design stems from our very
simple<00:00:38.850> premise<00:00:39.059> for<00:00:39.620> people<00:00:40.620> able<00:00:41.100> to<00:00:41.219> lift

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
simple premise for people able to lift

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.700 
simple premise for people able to lift
it<00:00:41.579> by<00:00:41.700> hand<00:00:41.969> and<00:00:42.300> set<00:00:42.960> it<00:00:43.079> up<00:00:43.200> in<00:00:43.320> under<00:00:43.410> two

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
it by hand and set it up in under two

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.290 
it by hand and set it up in under two
minutes<00:00:43.739> without<00:00:44.219> the<00:00:44.460> need<00:00:44.610> for<00:00:44.670> any<00:00:45.000> tools

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
minutes without the need for any tools

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.889 
minutes without the need for any tools
or<00:00:45.480> heavy<00:00:45.660> machinery<00:00:46.820> and<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:48.270> idea<00:00:48.660> came

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
or heavy machinery and the idea came

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.040 
or heavy machinery and the idea came
from<00:00:48.960> literally<00:00:49.410> your<00:00:50.219> basic<00:00:50.579> coffee<00:00:50.789> pot<00:00:51.120> so

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
from literally your basic coffee pot so

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.330 
from literally your basic coffee pot so
just<00:00:52.260> a<00:00:52.320> few<00:00:52.500> days<00:00:52.590> after<00:00:52.800> Hurricane<00:00:53.100> Katrina

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
just a few days after Hurricane Katrina

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.549 
just a few days after Hurricane Katrina
the<00:00:54.149> idea<00:00:54.420> of<00:00:54.480> dawned<00:00:54.690> on<00:00:54.870> us<00:00:54.930> so<00:00:55.170> if<00:00:55.260> you<00:00:55.379> take

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
the idea of dawned on us so if you take

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:56.959 
the idea of dawned on us so if you take
a<00:00:55.590> coffee<00:00:55.920> cup<00:00:56.160> and<00:00:56.340> turn<00:00:56.520> it<00:00:56.640> upside<00:00:56.940> down

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
a coffee cup and turn it upside down

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.029 
a coffee cup and turn it upside down
essentially<00:00:57.960> you<00:00:58.020> have<00:00:58.079> a<00:00:58.199> two-part<00:00:58.680> design

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
essentially you have a two-part design

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.069 
essentially you have a two-part design
that<00:00:59.250> literally<00:00:59.489> snaps<00:00:59.879> together<00:01:00.090> for<00:01:00.750> floor

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
that literally snaps together for floor

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.840 
that literally snaps together for floor
snaps<00:01:01.379> on<00:01:01.530> your<00:01:01.770> roof<00:01:01.980> and<00:01:02.160> walls<00:01:02.340> it's<00:01:02.699> an

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
snaps on your roof and walls it's an

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.789 
snaps on your roof and walls it's an
insulated<00:01:03.359> rigid<00:01:03.660> structure<00:01:03.989> actually

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
insulated rigid structure actually

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.590 
insulated rigid structure actually
sleeve<00:01:05.220> together<00:01:05.549> so<00:01:05.820> we<00:01:05.909> can<00:01:06.030> actually<00:01:06.180> put<00:01:06.570> a

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
sleeve together so we can actually put a

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.630 
sleeve together so we can actually put a
tremendous<00:01:06.869> amount<00:01:07.590> of<00:01:07.680> shelter<00:01:08.100> in<00:01:08.280> a<00:01:08.369> very

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
tremendous amount of shelter in a very

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.250 
tremendous amount of shelter in a very
small<00:01:08.939> volume<00:01:09.360> for<00:01:09.630> efficient

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
small volume for efficient

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.679 
small volume for efficient
transportation<00:01:10.590> and<00:01:11.100> shipping<00:01:11.220> a<00:01:11.700> reaction

transportation and shipping a reaction

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.750 
transportation and shipping a reaction
we<00:01:12.810> get<00:01:12.990> calls<00:01:13.260> literally<00:01:13.890> every<00:01:14.340> day<00:01:14.520> from
