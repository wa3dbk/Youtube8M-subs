 Hi, I'm Eugenie. 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:16.530
 Today is for another microwave cake in the mug: chocolate baking dessert. 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:24.200
 First, spread 2 teaspoons of unsalted butter diluted in 1 slice of sandwich bread. 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.780
 I do not add cream in the mixture today, 

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:32.780
 So a decent amount of butter is a must-have for this recipe. 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:39.360
 Slice bread into small squares. 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.200
 And add in the mug. 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.990
 Only 1 bread is enough for one cup. 

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:47.410
 Long cups are not recommended. 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:53.410
 Such relatively large ones are good. 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:59.570
 Then distribute 2 tablespoons of chopped chocolate between the bread. 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:06.370
 I love these dark chocolate NestlÃ©, Noir chocolate. 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:10.070
 Dust with crushed cinnamon. 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:16.070
 In a cup, crack in an egg and add in 2 tablespoons of sugar. 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:18.070
 Then cream together until white. 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:23.200
 Make sure the sugar is completely included. 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:29.200
 Then add 1/3 cup of milk and stir until smooth. 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:39.750
 Carefully pour the bread into the mug. 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:54.560
 Now microwave for 1 minute. Then 30 seconds. 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:00.560
 If the dessert is still liquidy, repeat the microwave for only 20 seconds at a time until done. 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:08.660
 It took me 2 minutes and 10 seconds today. Microwave time varies depending on the microwave oven. 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:12.600
 Voila, 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.250
 Bread pudding in the mug. 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:20.710
 And never forget the chocolate sauce. 

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:26.710
 Yes, it's time to fix the chocolate fast! 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:29.200
 Bon appetite. 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:35.200
 I would love the very soft bread pudding with melted dark chocolate and rich chocolate sauce. 

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:46.490
 You can also be with my salted caramel French. 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:51.620
 I have both chocolate sauce and salted caramel in separate videos. 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:57.320
 I have Raisin bread pudding for baking in another video. 

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:03.320
 Also find my chocolate cinnamon bread pudding recipe for baking at eugeniekitchen.com. 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:12.000
 If you love a cake in a mug, I have two more recipes: chocolate cake and nutella cookies. 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:20.820
 thanks for watching. Bye for now.
