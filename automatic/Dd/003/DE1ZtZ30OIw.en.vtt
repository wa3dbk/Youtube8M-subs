00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:07.990
 Good day to all in this 

00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:11.269
 video i would like to talk about 

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:16.939
 making homemade bottom protection 

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:20.060
 for the car it means we purchased 

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:20.769
 car him and so let's say after 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:23.689
 inspection 

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:29.420
 I didn’t like the bottom one either 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:33.680
 protection protection gearbox and engine after 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:35.530
 withdrawing well here's how it looks protection 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:39.260
 everything is taken in mint eyes 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:42.230
 on the rear mount torn off were already 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:44.810
 see more than once the previous owner tried 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:50.110
 and boil some nails there 

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:50.110
 imposed and in the end they came off again 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:58.970
 itself so let's say the protections are made of 

00:00:55.310 --> 00:01:05.420
 material thickness is about 0 5 or 0 7 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:06.770
 millimeters can edinichki but I hardly 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:11.180
 did not begin to restore it 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:13.010
 this defense is there to boil up 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:14.990
 in the end, I just decided to make a new one 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:18.500
 better protection more like 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:21.250
 let's say better now I will show that in the end 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.250
 I got 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:37.710
 that's what I ended up with 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:41.180
 ready new protection she made 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:44.880
 standard protection 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:49.200
 I completed it from iron sheet 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:52.440
 took from iron 2 millimeters thick then 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:56.909
 there is a thickness of protection bottom me now 2 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:02:00.630
 millimeter new mount made such 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:03.360
 same as on the staff as a result of new protection 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:07.340
 I get tired of the standard car 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:12.590
 rear anchorages front 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:15.260
 front mount so on self protection i 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:18.950
 drilled so let's say such here 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:21.540
 drainage holes staggered 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:24.150
 they are made for us case there 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:27.569
 snow ingress or even just moisture 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:29.549
 so that there is a way to get wet 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:33.319
 if you attack or there will melt snow 

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:36.989
 winter period of car operation 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:40.489
 so back means piles tailgate and well 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:44.160
 and generally all bolts 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:47.100
 after the bend, I still passed the point 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:50.989
 by welding so let's say for better 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:50.989
 strength and for reliability 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:58.950
 all corners failed all the joints too 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:03.120
 boil only this protection 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:06.380
 unlike the standard I will say so 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:10.340
 I will increase this width of the front part 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:13.310
 this width also coincides with the width 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:16.859
 protection on the car it is still to come 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:17.480
 engine installed on the same 

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:20.670
 front 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:23.940
 That's just it coincides with the width of the 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:26.989
 I have front protection smoothly 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:29.959
 goes into lower protection 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:32.670
 also on the new defense I did not do 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:35.910
 so let's say technologically 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:37.990
 technological hole for drain 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:40.120
 traffic jams 

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:43.930
 because I figured that anyway 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:45.910
 for me there is no so let's say difficulties 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:48.400
 remove the entire protection to change there 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:50.490
 for example engine oil or even there 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:55.050
 on occasion 

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:59.820
 boxes and left here is a battle 

00:03:55.050 --> 00:04:02.410
 this protection is cooked for 2 pm 

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:06.630
 now I have the third night went well 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:08.680
 will say worked with her after work 

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:12.720
 more accurately engaged in the manufacture of it 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:17.470
 protection after work now I cleared out 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:19.590
 left to degrease further I'll cover it here 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:25.230
 so anticorrosive and anti 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:25.230
 the traditional guarantor of the universal 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:32.680
 I don’t know yet 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:35.710
 will cover with anti-gravity 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:41.980
 in our market or just painted in 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:46.030
 black color do not know so friends here 

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:47.190
 so I made the protection quite 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:49.690
 do it yourself 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:53.380
 I would not say that it will come out for money 

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:55.480
 more expensive than the standard buy a new one 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:05:00.180
 now let's just show you 

00:04:55.480 --> 00:05:00.180
 meet old new difference 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:11.130
 that's how we see the old mount here 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:17.580
 as far as neck dining and here it is 

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:19.950
 there is no hole on it next 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:22.560
 video I will probably show you bye 

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:26.730
 protection will be installed on the car and 

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:30.140
 what it will look like to whom the video was 

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:34.380
 interesting and useful, I will only be glad 

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:36.410
 thank you all so much for watching everyone 

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:36.410
 good luck
