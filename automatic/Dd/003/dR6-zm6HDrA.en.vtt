00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:07.980
 for over 50 years 1500 tons of gold 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:09.510
 German are stored in the 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.969
 high security neighborhood of the bank 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.290
 US central fed to 26 meters in 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.570
 below sea level on the

 manhattan rock it fit to the place 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.770
 the safest in the world affirms the 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.150
 Americans however years past 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.740
 voices were heard in 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.210
 germany which demanded that laure 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.539
 Germans return to the territory 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.250
 German 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.380
 as did the French in the 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.980
 70s for their own reserves 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.630
 gold at the time France was gone 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.050
 look north in new york with 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.050
 warships 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:41.610
 this great German gold treasure to a 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.140
 against the value of about 70 billion 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.850
 US dollars and in case 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.590
 collapse of the euro it would be a 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:50.879
 solid foundation to cover a new 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:52.680
 currency the 1500 tons of gold are the 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.949
 product of the hard work of the people 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.050
 German 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.969
 they come from the time of the after 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.260
 war when germany spawned 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.989
 great benefits by its scale 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.129
 surplus commercial with foreign 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:06.270
 what we called a miracle 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:08.280
 economic and now the fed refuses 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.290
 to return to Germany his property 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.479
 in 2012 after years of arm wrestling 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:17.580
 she agreed to make at least 300 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:19.229
 tons before 2020 for 2013 it was 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:23.009
 planned to bring that back when we sleep in 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:24.150
 germany actually there have been only 37 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.340
 tons that were actually 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.590
 return 32 tons came from paris 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.860
 and only 5 tons actually of the 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.860
 Fed 

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:35.140
 moreover these five tons were not 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:37.600
 gold bullion from the original reserve 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:40.030
 from germany it was gold bullion 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.830
 newly melted with the 2013 mark 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.000
 the German politicians they 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:44.710
 had to control the gold reserves 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.600
 German returned empty-handed from 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:47.980
 New York 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.380
 till today the fed refuses to 

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:52.030
 submit a list of bullion 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:54.340
 eminent economists experts of the world 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.690
 whole are okay when german has 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:57.280
 faded away 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:00.520
 Germany will never see her again 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.300
 gold warns william quai the ex-manager of 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.910
 goldman sachs 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:05.650
 and that while knowing that the fed did 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:07.420
 never been allowed to use this gold 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:09.160
 because they had been entrusted to him only 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.510
 to keep it it's an act 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.310
 incomparable diversion of 

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:14.260
 provocation and he's actively covered 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.610
 by German politicians ago 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.710
 a few weeks it was announced that the 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:19.210
 return of 300 tons of gold before 2020 

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:20.740
 was going to be canceled 

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:22.270
 United States pressure was getting too much 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:25.000
 strong so the politics 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:27.340
 German bent the politician of the cdu 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.050
 norbert bartle asserted in front of the media 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.720
 Americans pay attention to 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:33.130
 our gold until when Germany has to 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:35.110
 she bend before the united states in 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:36.490
 all business when at 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:37.959
 instead of having politicians who 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:39.340
 betray the country of women and 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:41.020
 men will rise to new 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:41.620
 courageously defend the interests 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:43.060
 of Germany 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.530
 are we allowed to throw 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:46.480
 fruits of the toil of a whole nation in 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:47.440
 food for the greed of bankers 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.450
 great pundits of finance 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.610
 even American politicians like the 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:53.200
 congressman ron paul doubt 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:55.060
 basically that gold reserves 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:58.209
 from different countries stored in the states 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:58.989
 united still exists physically so much 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:00.280
 that this is so 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:02.500
 Germany is perfectly entitled 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:05.130
 to require at least supervision of its 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.130
 own reserves 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:13.170
 a sovereign state must be able to 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:14.910
 that otherwise he is not sovereign if he 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.349
 Please send these videos to 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:17.880
 to publicize the scandal of their 

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:20.540
 German to the world public opinion 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.540
 thank you so much
