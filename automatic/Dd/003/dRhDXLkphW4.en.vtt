I'll show you how to harvest it as well
you'll<00:00:28.380> notice<00:00:28.619> that<00:00:28.769> when<00:00:29.250> we<00:00:29.519> look<00:00:30.119> a<00:00:30.210> bit

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
you'll notice that when we look a bit

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.359 
you'll notice that when we look a bit
closer<00:00:30.599> at<00:00:30.929> this<00:00:31.109> you'll<00:00:31.769> see<00:00:31.859> that<00:00:32.099> there<00:00:32.340> are

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
closer at this you'll see that there are

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.000 
closer at this you'll see that there are
a<00:00:32.550> whole<00:00:32.669> range<00:00:33.030> of<00:00:33.210> growing<00:00:33.600> bucks<00:00:33.890> when<00:00:34.890> we

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
a whole range of growing bucks when we

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.190 
a whole range of growing bucks when we
plant<00:00:35.309> this<00:00:35.550> we<00:00:35.760> will<00:00:35.910> make<00:00:36.059> sure<00:00:36.390> that<00:00:36.719> these

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
plant this we will make sure that these

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.740 
plant this we will make sure that these
buds<00:00:37.500> are<00:00:37.649> facing<00:00:38.100> up<00:00:38.219> and<00:00:38.340> most<00:00:38.610> so<00:00:39.329> that<00:00:39.540> when

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
buds are facing up and most so that when

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.410 
buds are facing up and most so that when
the<00:00:39.870> plant<00:00:40.140> grows<00:00:40.469> it<00:00:41.070> can<00:00:41.399> go<00:00:41.879> towards<00:00:42.300> the

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
the plant grows it can go towards the

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.380 
the plant grows it can go towards the
surface<00:00:44.989> here's<00:00:45.989> my<00:00:46.140> cherry

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:47.390 
surface here's my cherry

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:50.420 
surface here's my cherry
turmeric<00:00:48.390> is<00:00:48.719> very<00:00:49.410> similar<00:00:49.620> to<00:00:49.890> ginger<00:00:50.309> in

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
turmeric is very similar to ginger in

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:51.979 
turmeric is very similar to ginger in
the<00:00:50.550> way<00:00:50.730> in<00:00:50.789> which<00:00:51.030> it<00:00:51.149> grows<00:00:51.360> and<00:00:51.660> the<00:00:51.750> types

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
the way in which it grows and the types

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.200 
the way in which it grows and the types
of<00:00:52.170> conditions<00:00:52.649> that<00:00:52.829> it<00:00:52.920> likes<00:00:53.190> so<00:00:54.180> I

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
of conditions that it likes so I

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.510 
of conditions that it likes so I
prepared<00:00:54.660> a<00:00:54.809> bed<00:00:55.140> here<00:00:55.559> which<00:00:56.129> I'm<00:00:56.280> going<00:00:56.309> to

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
prepared a bed here which I'm going to

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.880 
prepared a bed here which I'm going to
plant<00:00:56.820> this<00:00:57.000> in<00:00:57.270> it's<00:00:57.660> very<00:00:57.899> near<00:00:58.230> where<00:00:58.620> my

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
plant this in it's very near where my

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.130 
plant this in it's very near where my
ginger<00:00:59.340> bed<00:00:59.520> is<00:00:59.820> as<00:01:00.239> well<00:01:00.480> as<00:01:00.629> for<00:01:00.809> that<00:01:00.930> matter

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
ginger bed is as well as for that matter

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.869 
ginger bed is as well as for that matter
my<00:01:01.410> Jerusalem<00:01:01.920> artichokes<00:01:02.460> which<00:01:02.670> I've

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
my Jerusalem artichokes which I've

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.479 
my Jerusalem artichokes which I've
previously<00:01:03.239> planted<00:01:04.100> the<00:01:05.100> types<00:01:05.339> of

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
previously planted the types of

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.280 
previously planted the types of
conditions<00:01:05.970> that<00:01:06.060> we<00:01:06.180> need<00:01:06.450> to<00:01:06.600> be<00:01:06.750> mindful<00:01:07.049> of

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
conditions that we need to be mindful of

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.219 
conditions that we need to be mindful of
the<00:01:07.860> fact<00:01:08.070> that<00:01:08.220> turmeric<00:01:08.880> number<00:01:09.540> one<00:01:09.750> is<00:01:10.170> a

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
the fact that turmeric number one is a

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.990 
the fact that turmeric number one is a
reasonably<00:01:10.799> heavy<00:01:10.979> feeder<00:01:11.369> and<00:01:11.610> so<00:01:11.790> therefore

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
reasonably heavy feeder and so therefore

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.810 
reasonably heavy feeder and so therefore
it<00:01:12.479> needs<00:01:12.780> to<00:01:13.049> have<00:01:13.320> good<00:01:13.619> soil<00:01:13.890> and<00:01:14.189> it's

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
it needs to have good soil and it's

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.120 
it needs to have good soil and it's
always<00:01:15.119> a<00:01:15.150> good<00:01:15.390> idea<00:01:15.540> to<00:01:16.080> get<00:01:16.740> a<00:01:16.799> good

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
always a good idea to get a good

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.570 
always a good idea to get a good
addition<00:01:17.670> of<00:01:18.000> compost<00:01:18.840> to<00:01:18.960> that<00:01:19.290> soil<00:01:19.619> in

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
addition of compost to that soil in

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.840 
addition of compost to that soil in
addition<00:01:21.030> to<00:01:21.119> that<00:01:21.299> it<00:01:21.990> likes<00:01:22.320> moisture

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:22.850 
addition to that it likes moisture

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:25.789 
addition to that it likes moisture
having<00:01:23.850> said<00:01:24.060> that<00:01:24.090> it<00:01:24.720> doesn't<00:01:25.049> like<00:01:25.439> wet

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
having said that it doesn't like wet

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.950 
having said that it doesn't like wet
feet<00:01:26.159> but<00:01:26.490> it<00:01:26.610> does<00:01:26.850> like<00:01:27.299> having<00:01:27.750> its

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
feet but it does like having its

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.560 
feet but it does like having its
moisture<00:01:28.409> level<00:01:28.680> kept<00:01:28.920> up<00:01:29.070> to<00:01:29.340> it<00:01:29.460> so<00:01:30.360> keep

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
moisture level kept up to it so keep

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.870 
moisture level kept up to it so keep
that<00:01:30.720> in<00:01:30.840> mind<00:01:31.310> when<00:01:32.310> it<00:01:32.340> comes<00:01:32.640> to<00:01:32.759> the

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
that in mind when it comes to the

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.190 
that in mind when it comes to the
preparation<00:01:33.090> of<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:33.630> soil

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
preparation of the soil

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.410 
preparation of the soil
now<00:01:35.100> with<00:01:35.280> this<00:01:35.400> turmeric<00:01:35.850> or<00:01:36.030> I'm<00:01:36.119> going<00:01:36.329> to

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
now with this turmeric or I'm going to

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.390 
now with this turmeric or I'm going to
do<00:01:36.570> is<00:01:36.720> place<00:01:36.960> it<00:01:36.990> around<00:01:37.500> the<00:01:37.829> place<00:01:38.070> in

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
do is place it around the place in

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.480 
do is place it around the place in
different<00:01:39.329> locations<00:01:40.140> probably<00:01:41.130> somewhere

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
different locations probably somewhere

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.550 
different locations probably somewhere
in<00:01:41.549> the<00:01:41.640> region<00:01:41.880> of<00:01:42.180> about<00:01:42.329> 25<00:01:43.140> to<00:01:43.350> 30

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
centimetres apart now I'm going to plant

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.499 
centimetres apart now I'm going to plant
the<00:01:47.040> somewhere<00:01:47.460> in<00:01:47.549> the<00:01:47.640> region<00:01:47.939> of<00:01:48.000> about<00:01:48.119> 10

to<00:01:48.630> 15<00:01:49.020> centimetres<00:01:49.560> deep<00:01:50.720> so<00:01:51.720> that's<00:01:51.869> what

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
to 15 centimetres deep so that's what
