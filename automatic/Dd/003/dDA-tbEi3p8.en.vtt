00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:26.160 
passion is a car standpoint I think they

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:27.409 
passion is a car standpoint I think they
do<00:05:26.220> and<00:05:26.520> I've<00:05:26.610> always<00:05:26.789> said<00:05:27.060> that<00:05:27.120> they<00:05:27.389> I

00:05:27.409 --> 00:05:27.419 
do and I've always said that they I

00:05:27.419 --> 00:05:30.500 
do and I've always said that they I
think<00:05:27.570> they<00:05:27.780> do<00:05:27.930> and<00:05:28.229> the<00:05:29.130> cost<00:05:29.370> of<00:05:29.700> petrol<00:05:30.180> you

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:30.510 
think they do and the cost of petrol you

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:33.620 
think they do and the cost of petrol you
know<00:05:30.600> regular<00:05:30.780> gasoline<00:05:31.850> will<00:05:32.850> help<00:05:33.150> bring

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:33.630 
know regular gasoline will help bring

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:36.020 
know regular gasoline will help bring
this<00:05:33.870> into<00:05:34.139> focus<00:05:34.440> as<00:05:34.800> it<00:05:35.370> increases<00:05:35.610> because

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:36.030 
this into focus as it increases because

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:39.440 
this into focus as it increases because
on<00:05:36.450> it<00:05:36.990> just<00:05:37.260> on<00:05:37.440> an<00:05:37.560> energy<00:05:38.100> density<00:05:38.970> basis

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:39.450 
on it just on an energy density basis

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:41.420 
on it just on an energy density basis
with<00:05:39.690> diesel<00:05:39.990> fuel<00:05:40.470> and<00:05:40.680> the<00:05:40.860> way<00:05:41.010> it's<00:05:41.190> used

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:41.430 
with diesel fuel and the way it's used

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:44.450 
with diesel fuel and the way it's used
it<00:05:42.419> has<00:05:42.690> an<00:05:42.840> advantage<00:05:43.169> and<00:05:43.560> so<00:05:43.800> that<00:05:43.830> that

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:44.460 
it has an advantage and so that that

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:48.320 
it has an advantage and so that that
thermodynamic<00:05:45.389> cycle<00:05:45.840> is<00:05:46.200> a<00:05:47.099> very<00:05:47.820> efficient

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:48.330 
thermodynamic cycle is a very efficient

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:51.140 
thermodynamic cycle is a very efficient
cycle<00:05:48.750> and<00:05:48.930> so<00:05:49.620> and<00:05:50.250> we<00:05:50.370> all<00:05:50.550> know<00:05:50.760> when<00:05:50.970> you<00:05:51.060> go

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:51.150 
cycle and so and we all know when you go

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:53.240 
cycle and so and we all know when you go
outside<00:05:51.300> of<00:05:51.570> this<00:05:51.660> country<00:05:51.720> and<00:05:52.349> you<00:05:52.979> drive
