00:00:15.729 --> 00:00:18.729
 not 

00:00:21.179 --> 00:00:24.179
 is it difficult 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:41.090
 nothing is okay 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:42.640
 you are right 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.640
 the werder bremen 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.610
 here is the deficit of 1 6 billion 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:51.310
 at 2:30 pm 

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:53.070
 % 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.910
 you will have to fulfill his mission in this sector 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:59.440
 according to them it will not be a part of the baton 

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:02.420
 four of them evolve 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:04.489
 the quality of the images

 at 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.330
 this is done in calm 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:10.780
 paris June 27 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:14.260
 your system 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:18.340
 no one can come to terms with this defeat the losc receives the 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:19.300
 sporting 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:22.210
 the ttp is the main responsible 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:23.860
 the scenario 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:27.030
 if you do not care about this world 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.900
 no later than this time this is not the time will probably always 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.290
 like that at his age 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:35.290
 but I told him 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:43.120
 but that was not a parenthesis that's why I'd be happy to be 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:44.690
 accused of real facts 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:47.690
 the Swiss had been evacuated 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.000
 according to frédéric leclef 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.870
 washington wants to avoid a fourth time 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:57.050
 and who was the best known is the highest do you think 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.940
 portrait of some specificities of these products of this type of technique 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:03.940
 but this team is not a priority 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:07.800
 now we're going to fuck you after the world 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:11.499
