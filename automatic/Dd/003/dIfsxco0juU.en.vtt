00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:52.629 
see there's a couple different kind of
game<00:01:51.349> settings<00:01:51.799> here<00:01:52.009> so<00:01:52.279> there's<00:01:52.520> the

00:01:52.629 --> 00:01:52.639 
game settings here so there's the

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:54.879 
game settings here so there's the
campaign<00:01:53.090> this<00:01:53.299> is<00:01:53.419> your<00:01:53.599> basic<00:01:53.889> campaign

00:01:54.879 --> 00:01:54.889 
campaign this is your basic campaign

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:57.279 
campaign this is your basic campaign
that<00:01:55.130> you've<00:01:55.279> been<00:01:55.520> playing<00:01:56.209> in<00:01:56.419> diablo<00:01:56.990> 3

00:01:57.279 --> 00:01:57.289 
that you've been playing in diablo 3

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:59.109 
that you've been playing in diablo 3
since<00:01:57.529> it<00:01:57.619> came<00:01:57.770> out<00:01:57.799> right<00:01:58.189> but<00:01:58.669> they<00:01:58.759> added

00:01:59.109 --> 00:01:59.119 
since it came out right but they added

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:01.769 
since it came out right but they added
adventure<00:01:59.899> mode<00:02:00.079> so<00:02:00.649> adventure<00:02:01.130> mode<00:02:01.310> is

00:02:01.769 --> 00:02:01.779 
adventure mode so adventure mode is

00:02:01.779 --> 00:02:05.109 
adventure mode so adventure mode is
basically<00:02:02.779> a<00:02:02.810> thing<00:02:03.139> that<00:02:03.999> pretty<00:02:04.999> much

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:05.119 
basically a thing that pretty much

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:06.789 
basically a thing that pretty much
randomizes<00:02:05.929> the<00:02:06.079> world<00:02:06.259> and<00:02:06.499> we'll<00:02:06.590> talk

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:06.799 
randomizes the world and we'll talk

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:08.830 
randomizes the world and we'll talk
about<00:02:06.979> this<00:02:07.219> in<00:02:07.279> a<00:02:07.429> future<00:02:07.579> video<00:02:08.030> but<00:02:08.720> it

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 
about this in a future video but it

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.470 
about this in a future video but it
makes<00:02:09.020> it<00:02:09.200> so<00:02:09.440> grinding<00:02:10.039> is<00:02:10.160> a<00:02:10.190> lot<00:02:10.399> more<00:02:11.239> fun

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
makes it so grinding is a lot more fun

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.050 
makes it so grinding is a lot more fun
and<00:02:11.810> it<00:02:12.440> actually<00:02:12.650> makes<00:02:12.980> leveling<00:02:13.760> up<00:02:13.850> a<00:02:13.940> new

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
and it actually makes leveling up a new

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:15.460 
and it actually makes leveling up a new
character<00:02:14.270> a<00:02:14.420> lot<00:02:14.660> better<00:02:14.900> because<00:02:15.140> you<00:02:15.320> have

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
character a lot better because you have

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:16.840 
character a lot better because you have
different<00:02:15.740> things<00:02:16.040> you<00:02:16.130> could<00:02:16.220> do<00:02:16.430> it

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:16.850 
different things you could do it

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:17.920 
different things you could do it
randomizes

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
randomizes

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.759 
randomizes
the<00:02:18.200> scenery<00:02:18.769> with<00:02:19.159> with<00:02:20.030> a<00:02:20.060> different<00:02:20.989> you

00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:21.769

the scenery with with a different you
know<00:02:21.859> I<00:02:22.069> guess<00:02:22.430> monster<00:02:22.849> types<00:02:23.120> and<00:02:23.450> then<00:02:23.569> it

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
know I guess monster types and then it

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:25.990 
know I guess monster types and then it
also<00:02:23.959> randomized<00:02:24.920> some<00:02:25.219> of<00:02:25.310> the<00:02:25.400> bosses<00:02:25.609> there

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
also randomized some of the bosses there

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.849 
also randomized some of the bosses there
too<00:02:26.239> so<00:02:26.510> you<00:02:26.569> can<00:02:26.750> have<00:02:26.900> a<00:02:26.930> lot<00:02:27.079> of<00:02:27.109> fun<00:02:27.319> just

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:04.630 
options and I'm really excited for the

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:05.999 
options and I'm really excited for the
fact<00:05:04.810> that<00:05:04.900> there<00:05:05.080> are<00:05:05.110> clans<00:05:05.560> in<00:05:05.740> the<00:05:05.860> game

00:05:05.999 --> 00:05:06.009

fact that there are clans in the game
now<00:05:06.039> it<00:05:06.340> I<00:05:06.520> think<00:05:06.880> it<00:05:06.940> helps<00:05:07.090> promote<00:05:07.530> that

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:08.530 
now it I think it helps promote that

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:10.050 
now it I think it helps promote that
community<00:05:09.009> because<00:05:09.190> without<00:05:09.340> the<00:05:09.669> auction

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:10.060 
community because without the auction

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:11.520 
community because without the auction

00:06:18.959 --> 00:06:18.969 
that and the Paragon system is now

00:06:18.969 --> 00:06:20.879 
that and the Paragon system is now
changed<00:06:19.419> and<00:06:19.569> has<00:06:19.960> additional<00:06:20.409> points<00:06:20.650> so<00:06:20.770> you

00:06:20.879 --> 00:06:20.889 
changed and has additional points so you

00:06:20.889 --> 00:06:22.529 
changed and has additional points so you
can<00:06:21.009> actually<00:06:21.159> spend<00:06:21.610> points<00:06:21.819> on<00:06:22.029> this<00:06:22.150> Delta

00:06:22.529 --> 00:06:22.539 
can actually spend points on this Delta

00:06:22.539 --> 00:06:25.740 
can actually spend points on this Delta
so<00:06:23.319> it's<00:06:23.469> pretty<00:06:23.620> cool<00:06:23.770> and<00:06:24.460> as<00:06:25.270> they<00:06:25.419> talk
