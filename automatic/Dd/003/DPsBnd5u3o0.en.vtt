it's<00:00:50.250> converted<00:00:51.059> into<00:00:51.559> electricity<00:00:52.559> and<00:00:53.129> then

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
it's converted into electricity and then

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.000 
it's converted into electricity and then
it's<00:00:53.640> put<00:00:54.180> in<00:00:54.390> actually<00:00:54.629> into<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.170> system<00:00:55.590> and

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
it's put in actually into the system and

the power of the Sun is something you

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.319 
the power of the Sun is something you

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
can see throughout the station we wanted

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.990 
can see throughout the station we wanted
to<00:01:00.480> achieve<00:01:00.600> as<00:01:01.140> much<00:01:01.280> light<00:01:02.280> natural<00:01:02.879> light

to achieve as much light natural light

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.429 
to achieve as much light natural light
as<00:01:03.149> we<00:01:03.300> could<00:01:03.510> in<00:01:03.629> this<00:01:03.780> facility

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
as we could in this facility

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.700 
as we could in this facility
so<00:01:05.189> by<00:01:05.369> maximizing<00:01:06.299> the<00:01:06.630> natural<00:01:07.110> light<00:01:07.350> we

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
so by maximizing the natural light we

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.469 
so by maximizing the natural light we
minimize<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.280> impact<00:01:08.670> on<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:08.970> system<00:01:09.360> and

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
minimize the impact on the system and

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.560 
minimize the impact on the system and

our operating cost the solar tubes as
you<00:01:12.689> can<00:01:12.840> tell<00:01:13.020> in<00:01:13.140> this<00:01:13.260> room<00:01:13.439> really<00:01:13.770> helped

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
you can tell in this room really helped

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.090 
you can tell in this room really helped
by<00:01:14.310> providing<00:01:14.670> natural<00:01:14.939> light<00:01:15.479> and<00:01:15.890> you<00:01:16.890> can

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
by providing natural light and you can

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.399 
by providing natural light and you can
see<00:01:17.460> that<00:01:17.759> the<00:01:18.210> natural<00:01:18.689> behavior<00:01:18.810> to<00:01:19.229> come

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
see that the natural behavior to come

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:20.929 
see that the natural behavior to come
into<00:01:19.560> this<00:01:19.710> room<00:01:19.799> would<00:01:20.100> be<00:01:20.130> to<00:01:20.400> want<00:01:20.610> to<00:01:20.790> turn
