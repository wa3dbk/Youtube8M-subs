00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:08.770
 hello friends bring the ray in review 

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:13.860
 dotcom I am david and today I love you 

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:13.860
 teach these to six fuji sensor 2 

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:21.279
 here you have friends as you see a 

00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:25.360
 blue and yellow design that has been 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:27.789
 carried a lot in previous seasons and 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:30.579
 this sneaker that is characterized on 

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:34.120
 all because of the sensitivity it gives 

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:38.980
 terrain now I explain a slipper 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:41.620
 of weight we could say in the middle or 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:44.710
 elevated regarding what is now in 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:47.560
 the market and that is I think that 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:50.980
 designed this version 2 has been redesigned 

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:51.670
 for longer distances for long 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:54.579
 distances 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:56.050
 now I will explain what we started 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:58.930
 what the sole refers to as 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:00.910
 you see relatively prominent tacos 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:02.290
 look in fact from here in the part 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:06.189
 very prominent front is the part 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:09.640
 back not so much with these bands that 

00:01:06.189 --> 00:01:12.460
 they are a kind of fixes like strawberry more 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:15.579
 or less in any position what you 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:19.000
 gives this kind of extra sensitivity to 

00:01:15.579 --> 00:01:21.039
 our foot fixes that in is a cue 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.210
 multidirectional with this part of 

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:24.020
 bending quite 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:25.820
 fix 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:29.149
 and on the front, look at the 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:30.710
 bit so good is a few tacos very 

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:33.439
 pronounced in this front 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:36.289
 note that the cut of the cue is vertical 

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:39.380
 they are not specifically designed 

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:41.689
 to favor the grip both in front 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.280
 like as in the back for 

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:46.429
 avoid them 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:48.979
 the skid what they are designed 

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:51.140
 it's so that when we step on it we do 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:53.869
 with all the studs at once with all the 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:57.079
 surface of the shoe which 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:02:00.739
 makes a greater grip in theory 

00:01:57.079 --> 00:02:04.909
 more surface where the foot will support 

00:02:00.739 --> 00:02:06.920
 It must also be said that the material 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:11.239
 of the rubber that you are seeing this 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:13.010
 black material is a h &amp; r is a material 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:15.409
 of asics 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:18.500
 to avoid abrasion so that it 

00:02:15.409 --> 00:02:19.700
 wear quickly notice that everything 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.459
 this is a piece and then there's 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:25.549
 different pieces in black here stuck 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:27.670
 to what would be the average one thing sole 

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:29.989
 stand out like the shoe 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:33.230
 he practically does not flinch when he 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:35.989
 tried to bend are these strips of these 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:38.120
 here plastic pieces more blue more 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:41.450
 intense and that is a hard plastic that is 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:43.319
 stability control of this sensor 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:46.140
 two 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:49.129
 we go to the midsole as you see two 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:54.870
 very different colors and is that they are 

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:57.569
 22 different densities of the cam 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:00.359
 Asics material called olite in this 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:05.269
 alone and 45 which is one of the most 

00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:10.769
 soft that there is of this range of sun and you 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:14.459
 also as you see these parts of blue 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:15.900
 is health system people alone in this in 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:18.359
 this ascent only takes part in 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:22.489
 rear does not carry in the front 

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:22.489
 like other asics shoes 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:26.670
 double density of sole we have 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:30.360
 commented on the drop exactly not what 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:33.030
 we know but we know that it will be around 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:36.450
 around 10 millimeters of drop of 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:39.989
 this elevator 2 all this does in addition 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:45.269
 with the gps impact guidance system 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:47.790
 system that the shoe between us 

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:49.409
 help to enter to make the transition and 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:53.220
 make the takeoff one more way 

00:03:49.409 --> 00:03:55.709
 Natural through this guide do not know if 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:58.530
 you can see it 's like the tacos are 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:04:01.200
 as open towards the fixed sides 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:03.840
 and they have a curve 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:06.060
 all this indicated for as I commented 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:09.020
 enter the transition and do the 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:12.290
 takeoff and shaft s 

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:14.900
 Let's see what would be the upper is a 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:17.090
 but quite soft as you can see 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:20.180
 even this front protection very 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:22.230
 marked is not so is not as robust as 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:24.330
 in other cases 

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:26.010
 look what you have here it seems that they are two 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:28.950
 materials but it is the same material 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:31.380
 as a kind of plastic mesh that 

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:34.440
 they cover the whole shoe in the 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:37.260
 lateral and that the consistency and not 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:40.350
 excessive a weight in this sense part 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:44.490
 rear fix a plastic part 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:47.400
 hard already downloaded or very consistent 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:48.750
 and a chassis that is not too much 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:52.080
 high 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:55.620
 more or less gets where the part of the 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:59.430
 piece is made of plastic and yes a 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:02.100
 inside as you see very padded and very 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:05.850
 nice I've had the opportunity to 

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:08.850
 to put your foot inside and the truth is 

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:12.930
 that I liked a lot to me reminds me 

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:16.080
 to slippers of other brands that are 

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:18.490
 in focused in this sense before 

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:22.770
 teach one inside 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:22.770
 I want to do a test because 

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:27.310
 we have seen that this shoe is 

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:28.630
 water repellent let's do the 

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:30.640
 test 

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:33.640
 The truth is that I have not done it before and 

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:37.300
 I do not know what will happen in this regard 

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:39.400
 let's throw water here 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:41.830
 as you see 

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:44.610
 the shoe is effectively repellent 

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:47.250
 to the water 

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:49.620
 as the upper has not got wet in 

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:54.180
 absolute so there are a few drops left in 

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:57.120
 the boards but it has not got wet so 

00:05:54.180 --> 00:06:00.639
 so much with one thing also to have in 

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:03.219
 account of this sensor 2 

00:06:00.639 --> 00:06:05.020
 now if I show you the tongue with a 

00:06:03.219 --> 00:06:07.599
 bag to keep the knot of the 

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:10.330
 laces that is very thin and that runs very 

00:06:07.599 --> 00:06:12.699
 well always taking all this part 

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:15.969
 side to hold the foot fixed and the 

00:06:12.699 --> 00:06:19.960
 finished this very comfortable very padded 

00:06:15.969 --> 00:06:24.120
 also on the inside, fix and 

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:27.210
 see how it is finished is sensor 2 

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:30.260
 we just noticed this seam in the 

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:32.820
 part inside absolutely no more 

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:35.880
 all this is coated as you see with 

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:39.900
 this black fabric so that we do not give ourselves 

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:41.850
 no more stitching 

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:43.710
 as for the template, set one 

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:47.550
 very busy template very breathable 

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:51.509
 and that also gives extra cushioning 

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:53.789
 as you can see with very high profiles for 

00:06:51.509 --> 00:06:57.240
 that picks up enough foot in the part 

00:06:53.789 --> 00:06:59.750
 of the heel and a fairly high bridge 

00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:59.750
 although yes 

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:06.759
 of soft material for people who 

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:10.210
 do not need or that bothers you the part 

00:07:06.759 --> 00:07:11.650
 is from the bridge therefore friends me 

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:14.229
 I think that sensor is two 

00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:17.830
 evolved towards a shoe that yes 

00:07:14.229 --> 00:07:21.069
 of a little high weight but towards the 

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:23.919
 long distance towards comfort towards 

00:07:21.069 --> 00:07:27.220
 continue in the sense of sensitivity of 

00:07:23.919 --> 00:07:30.039
 ground of the sole but logically 

00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:32.409
 all this we will have to see in the 

00:07:30.039 --> 00:07:34.210
 review on our website 3rd in the 

00:07:32.409 --> 00:07:36.520
 dotcom review now that I invite you to 

00:07:34.210 --> 00:07:39.370
 you are connected to see how the 

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:41.500
 try and I invite you to stay connected 

00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:42.879
 also to the youtube channel to see all 

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:45.990
 the news of the world of training in 

00:07:42.879 --> 00:07:45.990
 until next time
