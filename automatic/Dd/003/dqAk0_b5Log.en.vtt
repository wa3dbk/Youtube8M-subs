00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:23.320 
had very short nails so we wanted to

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:25.440 
had very short nails so we wanted to
extend<00:01:23.649> them<00:01:23.829> a<00:01:23.920> little<00:01:24.159> bit<00:01:24.310> and<00:01:24.579> how<00:01:25.240> did<00:01:25.359> you

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:25.450 
extend them a little bit and how did you

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:25.739 
extend them a little bit and how did you
start

00:01:25.739 --> 00:01:25.749 
start

00:01:25.749 --> 00:01:30.120 
start
I<00:01:25.920> applied<00:01:26.920> tips<00:01:27.280> and<00:01:28.049> we<00:01:29.049> used<00:01:29.320> a<00:01:29.649> soak<00:01:29.920> off

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:30.130 
I applied tips and we used a soak off

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:33.359 
I applied tips and we used a soak off
gel<00:01:30.159> on<00:01:31.030> her<00:01:31.270> natural<00:01:31.659> nail<00:01:31.840> first<00:01:32.369> because

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:33.369 
gel on her natural nail first because

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:35.370 
gel on her natural nail first because
sometimes<00:01:33.969> the<00:01:34.329> models<00:01:34.689> don't<00:01:35.049> want<00:01:35.200> to<00:01:35.259> wear

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:35.380 
sometimes the models don't want to wear

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:37.529 
sometimes the models don't want to wear
them<00:01:35.560> afterwards<00:01:36.130> so<00:01:36.429> it<00:01:36.579> just<00:01:36.999> makes<00:01:37.210> getting

00:01:37.529 --> 00:01:37.539 
them afterwards so it just makes getting

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:40.080 
them afterwards so it just makes getting
them<00:01:37.780> off<00:01:37.929> a<00:01:37.960> little<00:01:38.170> bit<00:01:38.319> easier<00:01:38.969> then<00:01:39.969> we

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090 
them off a little bit easier then we

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:43.440 
them off a little bit easier then we
applied<00:01:40.390> the<00:01:40.569> tip<00:01:40.810> and<00:01:41.109> I<00:01:41.890> applied<00:01:42.490> a<00:01:42.939> few

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:47.990 
regular color gel correct I use just a

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:50.860 
regular color gel correct I use just a
regular<00:03:48.230> color<00:03:48.620> gel<00:03:48.950> and<00:03:49.250> I<00:03:49.340> applied<00:03:49.730> a<00:03:50.150> thin

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:50.870

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:55.610 
because I had the gel that could gel

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:57.370

the<00:04:35.440> same<00:04:35.650> manufacturer<00:04:36.190> you<00:04:36.700> can<00:04:36.880> usually

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:37.090 
the same manufacturer you can usually

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:38.550 
the same manufacturer you can usually
get<00:04:37.450> away<00:04:37.480> with<00:04:37.780> crossing<00:04:38.230> over<00:04:38.350> their

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:38.560 
get away with crossing over their

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:41.400 
get away with crossing over their
products<00:04:39.130> once<00:04:39.970> the<00:04:40.120> blue<00:04:40.300> gel<00:04:40.510> was<00:04:40.810> cured

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:41.410 
products once the blue gel was cured

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:43.290 
products once the blue gel was cured
then<00:04:41.740> what<00:04:41.919> you<00:04:42.040> do<00:04:42.160> next<00:04:42.340> I<00:04:42.639> went<00:04:43.090> ahead<00:04:43.150> and

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:43.300 
then what you do next I went ahead and

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:45.570 
then what you do next I went ahead and
applied<00:04:43.480> a<00:04:43.750> thin<00:04:43.990> layer<00:04:44.380> of<00:04:44.410> the<00:04:44.860> top<00:04:44.889> gel<00:04:45.370> and

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:45.580 
applied a thin layer of the top gel and

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:47.790 
applied a thin layer of the top gel and
I<00:04:45.639> used<00:04:45.850> the<00:04:46.000> soak<00:04:46.210> off<00:04:46.419> top<00:04:46.660> gel<00:04:46.960> again<00:04:47.530> just

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:47.800 
I used the soak off top gel again just

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.590 
I used the soak off top gel again just
so<00:04:47.919> it's<00:04:48.160> a<00:04:48.220> little<00:04:48.430> bit<00:04:48.550> easier<00:04:48.730> for<00:04:49.389> the

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:49.600 
so it's a little bit easier for the

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:52.530 
so it's a little bit easier for the
model<00:04:49.930> to<00:04:49.960> remove<00:04:50.560> that<00:04:50.770> if<00:04:50.980> she<00:04:51.130> chose<00:04:51.400> and<00:04:51.820> to

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:52.540 
model to remove that if she chose and to

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:54.360
