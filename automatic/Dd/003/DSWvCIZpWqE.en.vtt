00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:07.420
 in this video I'm going to tell you 2 crepe and 

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:11.310
 pasta these are the game of the window 

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:11.310
 and do not look back enjoy it 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:16.279
 the first one is titled as the game 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:18.770
 of the window this is how it is 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:20.900
 Extremely easy to start though 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:23.480
 it requires a little time and like many 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:25.520
 things is random you just have to do one 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.769
 thing to play with a condition to 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:29.840
 do it you have to close the window and 

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:32.029
 the curtains in your room before 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:34.640
 lie down in the most careful way and 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:37.100
 suspicious possible with the condition of 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.650
 that it's the end of the month that's what attracts 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:41.780
 to the other participant but it is due 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:44.239
 inform that this is going to need several 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:46.460
 attempts since it does not always show up to 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:49.129
 the first usually occurs between 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:50.989
 the range of 6 to 12 attempts but 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:53.140
 how do you know if it worked and what 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:55.550
 important what is the game 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:58.760
 you'll know if it worked when the game 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:01.520
 begin and that my friends will be when 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:03.500
 you wake up and you will not wake up 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:05.720
 natural but to wake you up something 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.850
 dizzy or uneasy a tap on the 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:10.280
 window you're going to start listening 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:12.619
 taps on the window at the beginning 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:15.320
 They will be slow and smooth but little by little 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:17.570
 they will be stronger and more constant as you 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.320
 the other part of the game you have to play 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:20.360
 and what 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.880
 what to do is very simple you have to 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:25.130
 pretend you're asleep here is where 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:27.050
 things get interesting because 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:29.630
 there are several things that betray someone 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:31.520
 that is not asleep moves a lot does not 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.650
 completely cover your head with 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:36.590
 sheets but most important of all 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:38.810
 one does not sleep with his eyes open 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:41.509
 you have to pretend to be asleep without 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:43.790
 no time to open your eyes while 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:45.979
 so much what is on the other side is going to 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:48.050
 keep hitting the window until 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:50.119
 there will be a point where it will stop 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:53.390
 hit the window for nothing of the world you 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:55.580
 you sleep is a trap he always does 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:57.560
 makes you believe that it's over but in 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:59.899
 actually you want to surprise so that 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:02.180
 open your eyes the entity will follow 

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:04.520
 touching and hitting the window at each 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:06.740
 instantly throughout the night there will be 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.869
 opportunities where will you hit so 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:11.450
 strong that you will believe that it will wake up 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:13.519
 someone is going to break the window 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:16.160
 you feel fear you are always protected 

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:18.709
 that you seem asleep do not ask for help 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:21.410
 nobody will be able to help you, you and that 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:23.810
 thing the game lasts all night until 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:25.130
 dawn you will know if you won when 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:28.340
 you see the sunlight coming out 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:30.140
 your window this my dear friends is 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.480
 a game that the most daring do 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.280
 experience seekers is a game 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.740
 that has become so popular that it 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:39.260
 comment constantly I have a friend 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:41.090
 who found a forum where they talked about 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.850
 this and they claimed to have participated in the 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:45.470
 game in which everyone agrees nobody 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:47.960
 knows what is behind the 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:50.300
 window nobody knows what happens to those who 

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:53.950
 they lose the game if they stop hitting the 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:53.950
 window at night is a trap 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:59.790
 the second is titled or as you do not look 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:02.610
 back you want to play a game 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:05.190
 dangerous I will recommend you a very 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:07.170
 good but I do not want problems I do not 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:09.150
 I'm responsible for what happens with this 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:10.920
 everything you do will be at your disposal 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:13.170
 and they are under their own account 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:15.239
 I am not responsible for how they use 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:17.970
 this information you only need 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:20.700
 very simple materials three matches with 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:22.709
 your box obviously to learn them a 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:25.200
 sheet of paper a pen and most 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:27.569
 important that you are completely alone 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.700
 in your home after midnight without 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:31.890
 no noise either from the inside or 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:33.720
 outside of your home everything must be 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:35.970
 in absolute silence 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:38.340
 you need to choose a room that room 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:40.260
 must be completely dark if 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:42.329
 some light enters through the window blocks 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:44.730
 There should not be any light 

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:46.440
 I repeat there must be total darkness that 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:48.780
 you can not even see your own 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:50.579
 nose all your home must be 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:53.220
 completely dark and silent 

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:55.500
 absolute turns off everything that has some 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:57.959
 light even if it's minimal and anything 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:59.609
 make some noise every room of the 

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:00.800
 home must be with your door 

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:03.110
 closed 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:05.480
 of the selected room you should wait 

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:07.700
 about 10 minutes quietly tries to 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:10.010
 relax and prepare your mind although what 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:11.900
 I doubt very much that you can once this is done 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:14.120
 cut the paper by the number of rooms 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:15.650
 that there is in your home without counting the 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:18.620
 room where you are 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:21.290
 four fourths four papers and in each 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:23.540
 piece you write me your name's 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:26.450
 I invite you to a party cordially which 

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:28.250
 will last from start time to end time 

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:30.530
 I warn you to put the time less 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:32.420
 possible about five or ten minutes not 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:34.910
 you comment the big mistake of putting enough 

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:37.610
 time because believe me you will regret 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:39.500
 take the invitations made and introduce 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:41.900
 each paper below the door of 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:44.150
 all the rooms once this is done 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:46.640
 come back to the room take a break and 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:48.920
 shout are all welcome to my party 

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:51.350
 and turn off the light with the light off 

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:53.630
 go to the corner of the room take the 

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:56.240
 matchbox and try to turn on the 

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:58.010
 first match if this one does not turn on try 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:00.530
 with the other if none of the three 

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:02.870
 match matches means nobody came 

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:05.150
 to your party you can turn on the light but 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:07.340
 if some match lights up is that you have 

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:08.030
 guests in your house you will hold the 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:10.190
 match 

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:12.170
 of two and so you want more do not look 

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:14.780
 backwards I assure you that you are not going to 

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:16.130
 want to see them and there is no turning back and 

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:18.380
 you'll have to put up with the time 

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:20.450
 established because it will be very bad 

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:22.760
 education that you finish the party before 

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:25.040
 of time now you will have to endure what 

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:26.990
 more possible the match in your hand up 

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:29.450
 that it is no longer possible to hold it 

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:31.400
 when the match goes out no matter 

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:33.860
 the kind of person that you are going to 

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:35.930
 start feeling really bad you just go 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:38.390
 to feel that you are no longer alone and that 

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:40.610
 They are very close to you even though you are 

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:42.950
 all dark do not risk turning 

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:45.110
 not going to be that you reach to see something 

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:46.970
 when the time is over you yourself 

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:49.280
 You will feel that your guests have 

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:51.440
 marched and you 're completely alone 

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:54.140
 Feel confident and turn on the lights 

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:56.120
 but all those people who could not 

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:57.740
 hold and turn on the lights not 

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:59.750
 they wanted to talk again about the subject 

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:01.900
 the terror was so great so 

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:04.610
 they saw that they were marked for life 

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:07.010
