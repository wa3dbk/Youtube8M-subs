00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:17.360
 most common nutritional in hydro and aero 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:20.289
 ask or can only be provoked 

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:23.960
 from variation in the ph nlc 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:26.119
 in the hydromassage, mint the macro and micro 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.329
 items are exclusively provided 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:32.149
 from fertilizers in a concentrated way 

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:34.070
 for this reason in European hydro and ina 

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:37.579
 the shortcomings of macroelements are less 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:39.469
 frequent the most normal thing is that the 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:41.360
 hydroponic fertilizer companies 

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:44.210
 separate nutrients in different 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:46.120
 containers if they did not do so 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:48.020
 sulfur and calcium for example 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:50.120
 they would interact with each other generating 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.800
 of the plaster that would remain in turn 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.800
 in the cistern as a layer of 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.840
 white sediment must know the 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:01.370
 water starting quality water 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:04.159
 ideal must have a low 10 value 0.4 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:06.140
 if it is less than this value, yes 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:09.530
 add calcium and manganese so that 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:11.210
 the value reaches 0.4 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.920
 if instead the water has an and c 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:14.780
 greater than 0.6 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.620
 the water will have to pass through 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.940
 an osmosis filter these filters 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:23.740
 eliminate all water salts 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:23.740
 leaving the ca 0 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:33.450
 and since the ideal value is 0.4 as 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.280
 we just said need to this 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.020
 point to add some football and 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:41.280
 manganese until this is achieved 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.680
 value starting from 0.4 the water is ready 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.930
 and fertilizers can be added 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:49.140
 necessary working with water 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:51.330
 initial of ec 0 germs will appear 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.160
 and bacteria in the water and it will become 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:56.130
 very difficult to establish the value of 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:58.380
 ph or acidity in coastal areas 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.840
 Mediterranean holm oak is a lot 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.810
 higher than recommended coming 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:06.050
 even levels of 1.6 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:09.030
 in these cases it becomes essential 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:12.770
 the use of the osmosis filter is not 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.770
 expensive and work perfectly 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:17.400
 as regards the ph will constitute 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.920
 a problem in case it is not 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:22.709
 correctly set to 6 for example 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:25.080
 with a pH of 7 the absorption of iron and 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:27.570
 of manganese decreases by half and the 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:31.560
 phosphorus and calcium generate salts 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:34.350
 toxic to the plant with a pH of 8 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:36.209
 iron absorption is zero 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:38.550
 plants show a yellow color 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:41.160
 whitish in the buds and leaves 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:44.550
 newer this phenomenon is known as 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:46.110
 internally chlorosis is however worth noting 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:49.560
 still that the older leaves 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:51.450
 ph maintain their initial green 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:54.360
 of these plants for example remained 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.980
 over 7 for about 15 days which has 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:58.500
 provoked a very serious lack 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:00.810
 in the assortment of the engraved iron 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.700
 iron is the first mineral that stops 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.600
 to absorb the plant when the pH and 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.269
 greater than 6 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:08.100
 if the iron were mobile it would be a 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:09.480
 move from the old leaves to those 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.230
 younger to correct her 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.239
 shortages 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:14.250
 on the contrary it remains motionless on 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:16.530
 same old leaves that contained it 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.430
 from the beginning while the new shoots 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:21.430
 that they can't absorb it 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:23.859
 show the serious lack in the end the 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:25.810
 their color is totally white and all 

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:27.370
 all they could die 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:29.560
 solve by correcting the ph and 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:32.500
 thus allowing the plants to 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:34.689
 resume iron absorption of 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.819
 below we show you what happens if the 

00:03:34.689 --> 00:03:38.590
 ph remains at a level lower than 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:40.750
 5 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:43.209
 this farmer bought his own 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:45.549
 hydroponic system and after washing in 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:47.260
 satisfactory way the expanded clay has 

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:49.780
 decided to put a cutting for each 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:51.970
 tank filled the cistern 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:55.739
 of water and nutrients and regulated the 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:59.409
 conductivity letters at 0.4 and ph a 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:04:02.200
 5.8 raised the lamps to the maximum and has 

00:03:59.409 --> 00:04:04.269
 kept the humidity at 70 percent and the 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:07.120
 temperature at 22 degrees centigrade 

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:09.639
 meanwhile he waited impatiently 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.659
 signs of plant rooting though 

00:04:09.639 --> 00:04:13.239
 the days passed 

00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:15.430
 and these worsened showed a 

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:17.410
 yellowish color and inspecting the 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:19.599
 area of ​​the roots was visible a 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:21.160
 worsening of these continued to 

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:23.409
 keep everything apparently below 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:25.599
 control but the plants continued to 

00:04:23.409 --> 00:04:27.880
 get worse trying hard 

00:04:25.599 --> 00:04:29.800
 causing the problem by doing a 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:31.930
 accurate review inspected 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.770
 meticulously each component of the 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:35.260
 cultivation 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:38.169
 until he discovered his meter 

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:40.270
 ph didn't work perfectly 

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:43.479
 measurement marked 2 points above 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:47.110
 of reality marked a phd 6 when in 

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:49.599
 actually it was a ph 4 all his will die 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:51.820
 calibrated plants the meters every 15 

00:04:49.599 --> 00:04:53.289
 days approximately to avoid 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:55.180
 these problems 

00:04:53.289 --> 00:05:00.060
 another possibility is to use 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:05:00.060
 the ph test kit of hydroponic generals 

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:27.030

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:28.200
 general hydroponics obtained the
