let's<00:00:34.320> pursuit<00:00:34.649> it's<00:00:34.920> basically<00:00:35.640> a<00:00:35.730> dash

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
let's pursuit it's basically a dash

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.410 
let's pursuit it's basically a dash
there<00:00:35.969> moves<00:00:36.450> all<00:00:36.719> slows<00:00:38.059> pretty<00:00:39.059> much<00:00:39.210> should

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
there moves all slows pretty much should

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.500 
there moves all slows pretty much should
only<00:00:39.570> be<00:00:39.719> used<00:00:39.750> going<00:00:40.710> backwards<00:00:41.360> you<00:00:42.360> can

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
only be used going backwards you can

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.420 
only be used going backwards you can
some<00:00:42.719> nice<00:00:42.840> it<00:00:42.989> forward<00:00:43.320> as<00:00:43.379> a<00:00:43.410> mess<00:00:44.129> of<00:00:44.250> dash

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
some nice it forward as a mess of dash

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.630 
some nice it forward as a mess of dash
but<00:00:44.820> I<00:00:45.030> thought<00:00:45.300> it<00:00:45.390> is<00:00:45.450> just<00:00:45.840> remove<00:00:46.320> slows

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:46.640 
but I thought it is just remove slows

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.190 
but I thought it is just remove slows
dashboard<00:00:47.640> get<00:00:47.879> places<00:00:48.210> get<00:00:48.570> in<00:00:48.660> places<00:00:48.989> is

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
dashboard get places get in places is

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.100 
dashboard get places get in places is
ultimate<00:00:50.070> is<00:00:50.219> the<00:00:50.550> culling<00:00:51.030> it's<00:00:51.239> basically<00:00:51.989> a

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
ultimate is the culling it's basically a

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.430 
ultimate is the culling it's basically a
channeled<00:00:53.000> nuke<00:00:54.000> except<00:00:54.660> for<00:00:54.690> does<00:00:54.989> it<00:00:55.110> over

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
channeled nuke except for does it over

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.590 
channeled nuke except for does it over
time<00:00:55.820> basically<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:56.940> only<00:00:57.030> time<00:00:57.300> you<00:00:57.570> should

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
time basically the only time you should

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.360 
time basically the only time you should
be<00:00:57.930> using<00:00:58.140> it<00:00:58.350> is<00:00:58.530> when<00:00:58.739> you're<00:00:58.859> out<00:00:59.129> of<00:00:59.160> range

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
be using it is when you're out of range

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.189 
be using it is when you're out of range
for<00:00:59.489> our<00:00:59.640> attacks<00:00:59.940> or<00:01:00.239> you<00:01:00.719> just<00:01:00.930> can't

autotek<00:01:01.680> otherwise<00:01:02.039> like<00:01:02.520> they're<00:01:02.730> too<00:01:03.210> close

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
autotek otherwise like they're too close

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.179 
autotek otherwise like they're too close
or<00:01:03.629> whatever<00:01:03.870> basically<00:01:04.500> just<00:01:04.559> never<00:01:04.979> use<00:01:05.159> it

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
or whatever basically just never use it

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.609 
or whatever basically just never use it
until<00:01:05.519> you're<00:01:06.360> able<00:01:06.720> to<00:01:06.990> knock<00:01:07.170> out<00:01:07.290> attack
