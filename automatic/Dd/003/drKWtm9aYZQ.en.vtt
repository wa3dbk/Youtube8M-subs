start<00:00:59.489> facing<00:00:59.699> the<00:00:59.940> sea<00:01:00.210> like<00:01:00.420> that<00:01:00.629> look<00:01:00.989> at

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
start facing the sea like that look at

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.250 
start facing the sea like that look at
that<00:01:01.460> perfect<00:01:02.460> start<00:01:03.030> to<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.809> death<00:01:04.049> roll

the<00:01:16.710> first<00:01:16.860> one<00:01:17.189> it's<00:01:17.939> called<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.240> jet

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
the first one it's called the jet

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.969 
the first one it's called the jet
sandwich<00:01:19.340> now<00:01:21.110> another<00:01:22.110> jet<00:01:22.409> has<00:01:22.560> to<00:01:22.710> land<00:01:22.860> on

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
sandwich now another jet has to land on

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.700 
sandwich now another jet has to land on

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
is a little nudge and you'll slowly flip

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:30.590 
is a little nudge and you'll slowly flip
around<00:01:29.939> like<00:01:30.210> that

there we go slight they're like the Jets

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:33.710 
there we go slight they're like the Jets
are<00:01:32.610> mating<00:01:32.939> with<00:01:33.090> each<00:01:33.210> other

and this one need a helicopter and it's
called<00:02:03.540> the<00:02:03.630> Mario<00:02:03.930> and<00:02:04.969> all<00:02:05.969> you<00:02:06.119> have<00:02:06.240> to<00:02:06.299> do

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
called the Mario and all you have to do

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.199 
called the Mario and all you have to do
you<00:02:07.350> give<00:02:07.560> him<00:02:07.649> a<00:02:07.680> little<00:02:07.829> nudge<00:02:08.069> bought<00:02:08.789> like

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
you give him a little nudge bought like

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.330 
you give him a little nudge bought like
that<00:02:09.390> little<00:02:09.720> nudge<00:02:09.929> and<00:02:10.709> he'll<00:02:10.920> flip<00:02:11.129> right

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
that little nudge and he'll flip right

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.980 
that little nudge and he'll flip right
over

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
over

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:16.820 
over
and<00:02:13.640> as<00:02:14.640> you<00:02:14.850> can<00:02:14.970> see<00:02:15.030> he<00:02:15.630> is<00:02:15.840> nearly<00:02:16.500> ready

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
and as you can see he is nearly ready

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.540 
and as you can see he is nearly ready
for<00:02:17.610> the<00:02:17.700> flip<00:02:17.940> he's<00:02:18.540> in<00:02:18.750> position<00:02:19.020> so<00:02:19.710> that

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
for the flip he's in position so that

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.210 
for the flip he's in position so that
was<00:02:20.730> the<00:02:20.940> Mario<00:02:21.600> technique<00:02:22.110> and<00:02:22.560> I'll<00:02:23.010> show

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
was the Mario technique and I'll show

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:24.590 
was the Mario technique and I'll show
you<00:02:23.250> it<00:02:23.400> from<00:02:23.550> another<00:02:23.730> angle<00:02:23.820> as<00:02:24.210> well<00:02:24.330> just

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
you it from another angle as well just

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.780 
you it from another angle as well just
so<00:02:24.720> you<00:02:24.750> can<00:02:24.990> sort<00:02:25.230> of<00:02:25.260> get<00:02:26.100> you<00:02:26.250> so<00:02:26.430> it<00:02:26.550> looks

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
so you can sort of get you so it looks

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:30.820 
so you can sort of get you so it looks
and<00:02:27.180> this<00:02:27.750> is<00:02:28.490> this<00:02:29.490> is<00:02:29.670> the<00:02:29.820> Mario<00:02:30.030> again

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830 
and this is this is the Mario again

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:32.750 
and this is this is the Mario again
she's<00:02:31.830> giving<00:02:32.100> me<00:02:32.130> a<00:02:32.190> nice<00:02:32.310> little<00:02:32.520> nudge

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
she's giving me a nice little nudge

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:38.870 
she's giving me a nice little nudge
there<00:02:33.110> and<00:02:34.110> we<00:02:35.010> are<00:02:35.040> all<00:02:35.730> good<00:02:36.360> to<00:02:36.570> go<00:02:37.820> now<00:02:38.820> the

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
there and we are all good to go now the

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.610 
there and we are all good to go now the
third<00:02:39.510> technique<00:02:39.750> it's<00:02:40.410> a<00:02:40.470> bit

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
third technique it's a bit

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.830 
third technique it's a bit
unconventional<00:02:41.010> don't<00:02:41.910> normally<00:02:42.510> use<00:02:42.540> it<00:02:42.810> a

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
unconventional don't normally use it a

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.140 
unconventional don't normally use it a
lot<00:02:42.930> myself<00:02:43.080> but<00:02:43.800> you<00:02:44.610> can<00:02:44.730> actually<00:02:44.880> get<00:02:45.090> a

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
lot myself but you can actually get a

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.830 
lot myself but you can actually get a
boat<00:02:45.590> go<00:02:46.590> from<00:02:46.830> underneath<00:02:47.070> the<00:02:47.580> jet<00:02:47.820> no<00:02:48.720> one

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
boat go from underneath the jet no one

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:49.700 
boat go from underneath the jet no one
saw<00:02:49.020> that<00:02:49.050> coming

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:49.710 
saw that coming

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:52.280 
saw that coming
flip<00:02:50.220> it<00:02:50.340> around<00:02:50.370> that<00:02:50.640> way<00:02:50.820> and<00:02:51.030> there<00:02:52.020> we<00:02:52.110> go

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
flip it around that way and there we go

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.350 
flip it around that way and there we go
we're<00:02:52.470> in<00:02:52.530> the<00:02:52.740> in<00:02:53.400> the<00:02:53.550> North<00:02:53.760> position<00:02:54.650> now

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:56.360 
we're in the in the North position now

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:59.120 
we're in the in the North position now
at<00:02:57.360> this<00:02:57.540> moment<00:02:57.600> in<00:02:57.930> time<00:02:57.960> it'd<00:02:58.680> probably<00:02:58.890> be

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
at this moment in time it'd probably be

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:01.400 
at this moment in time it'd probably be
tempted<00:02:59.700> to<00:02:59.880> just<00:03:00.060> go<00:03:00.240> for<00:03:00.480> it<00:03:00.540> so<00:03:00.930> if<00:03:01.200> it's

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
tempted to just go for it so if it's

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:04.280 
tempted to just go for it so if it's
your<00:03:01.500> first<00:03:01.650> time<00:03:01.830> that's<00:03:02.580> fine<00:03:02.880> just<00:03:03.290> hold

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
your first time that's fine just hold

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.560 
your first time that's fine just hold
forward<00:03:04.920> hold<00:03:05.220> shift<00:03:05.580> get<00:03:05.910> the<00:03:06.000> afterburners

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:06.570 
forward hold shift get the afterburners

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:09.800 
forward hold shift get the afterburners
on<00:03:07.550> enjoy<00:03:08.550> yourself<00:03:08.910> you'd<00:03:09.330> probably<00:03:09.540> die

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
on enjoy yourself you'd probably die

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.720 
on enjoy yourself you'd probably die
that's<00:03:10.110> fine<00:03:10.380> but<00:03:10.890> that<00:03:11.040> isn't<00:03:11.280> why<00:03:11.370> we're<00:03:11.550> def

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
that's fine but that isn't why we're def

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.820 
that's fine but that isn't why we're def
railing<00:03:12.150> that<00:03:12.300> isn't<00:03:12.840> a<00:03:12.900> def<00:03:13.080> rail<00:03:13.290> that's<00:03:13.770> a

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.830 
railing that isn't a def rail that's a

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:15.620 
railing that isn't a def rail that's a
suicide<00:03:14.070> rail<00:03:14.490> so<00:03:15.060> what<00:03:15.240> we've<00:03:15.390> done<00:03:15.570> here

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
suicide rail so what we've done here

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:18.230 
suicide rail so what we've done here
we've<00:03:16.500> got<00:03:16.650> people<00:03:17.040> on<00:03:17.250> the<00:03:17.370> pipes<00:03:17.610> right

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:18.240 
we've got people on the pipes right

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:20.240 
we've got people on the pipes right
they've<00:03:18.660> got<00:03:18.690> to<00:03:18.900> jump<00:03:19.110> over<00:03:19.410> the<00:03:19.500> wings<00:03:19.710> can

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
they've got to jump over the wings can

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:23.570 
they've got to jump over the wings can
they<00:03:20.340> do<00:03:20.400> it<00:03:20.930> no<00:03:21.930> they<00:03:22.050> can't<00:03:22.320> but<00:03:23.190> they<00:03:23.250> tried

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:23.580 
they do it no they can't but they tried

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:27.340 
they do it no they can't but they tried
and<00:03:23.880> that<00:03:24.720> is<00:03:25.020> the<00:03:25.170> objective<00:03:25.290> of<00:03:25.910> death<00:03:26.910> rail

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:27.350 
and that is the objective of death rail

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:31.280 
and that is the objective of death rail
basically<00:03:28.350> and<00:03:29.060> a<00:03:30.060> more<00:03:30.570> advanced<00:03:30.810> version<00:03:30.930> of

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
basically and a more advanced version of

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.530 
basically and a more advanced version of
that<00:03:31.440> first<00:03:31.710> death<00:03:32.280> rail<00:03:32.520> here<00:03:33.210> we<00:03:33.270> go<00:03:33.420> we've

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
that first death rail here we go we've

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:35.090 
that first death rail here we go we've
got<00:03:33.570> more<00:03:33.810> people<00:03:34.020> there<00:03:34.380> bit<00:03:34.680> more<00:03:34.830> spread

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:35.100 
got more people there bit more spread

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:37.490 
got more people there bit more spread
out<00:03:35.160> trying<00:03:36.150> to<00:03:36.210> jump<00:03:36.390> over<00:03:36.510> he's<00:03:37.020> dead<00:03:37.320> he's
