00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.840
 Hello everyone, today I will show you how to make this beautiful sloppy side bun. 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:18.200
 It does not take much time and also looks very beautiful. Therefore, if you want to see how to make such a hairstyle, see below. 

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.420
 For my side beam, I'll leave my bangs as they are. 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:27.100
 I lay it on one side and on the same side I will create my bundle. 

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:30.730
 All we have to do is collect the hair. 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:35.920
 I collect hair on one side with a bang. 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:44.790
 When collected, combed and laid everything in place. 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:13.010
 After we make the tail, we divide the hair into two strands. So we comb the hair on one side. 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:21.670
 Take the hair tie and tie the tail. 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:31.760
 Like this we fix on one side. 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:48.340
 What we do is take a big comb again, why choose such a comb in order to make a pile quickly. 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:58.590
 We do the bouffant very carefully, so as not to damage the hair. Gently make light and fast bouffant. 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:05.540
 We create volume, it will be easy to make beautiful and careless. 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:13.630
 So what we have to do is lift the hair up 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.430
 like this and fix. 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.760
 You need to make sure you secure it securely. 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:53.020
 We take invisible and fix in the right places. 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:22.290
 I fasten invisibles around the beam to be sure that it is holding securely. 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:26.590
 It is not necessary to fasten around, but precisely on the place on which you want the bundle to hold. 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:34.460
 I fixed it so that I did not lie on my shoulder, but was a little higher. 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:10.550
 After you have securely fixed everything and are sure that the beam is securely held, 

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:16.750
 you must be sure that the invisible ones have the same color as the hair, since they should not be visible. 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:45.290
 So I should look at the end, as you can see everything is done very simply. 

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:49.890
 It looks difficult, but youth. I will show the rear view. 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:07.380
 I hope my video was useful and thanks for watching. Until
