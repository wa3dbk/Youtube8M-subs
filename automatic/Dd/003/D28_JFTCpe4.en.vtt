00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
kind of open it up and half a little bit

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:42.949 
kind of open it up and half a little bit
actually<00:03:41.700> before<00:03:42.000> you<00:03:42.180> do<00:03:42.360> that<00:03:42.510> to<00:03:42.750> make<00:03:42.810> it

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
actually before you do that to make it

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:46.430 
actually before you do that to make it
easier<00:03:43.230> fold<00:03:44.220> this<00:03:45.090> will<00:03:45.270> be<00:03:45.360> the<00:03:45.450> head<00:03:45.630> fold

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440 
easier fold this will be the head fold

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:49.920 
easier fold this will be the head fold
it<00:03:46.590> like<00:03:47.190> this

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:49.930 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:52.800 

and<00:03:50.019> then<00:03:50.560> flip<00:03:50.799> it<00:03:50.920> over<00:03:51.069> and<00:03:51.280> fold<00:03:51.790> it<00:03:52.030> same

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:52.810 
and then flip it over and fold it same

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:56.230 
and then flip it over and fold it same
way

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:56.240 

00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:00.150

shape

00:04:17.879 --> 00:04:17.889 

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:19.770

00:04:58.480 --> 00:04:58.490 
now you can take the head and write it

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:01.120 
now you can take the head and write it
like<00:04:58.610> this<00:04:58.669> point<00:04:59.120> point<00:05:00.110> times<00:05:00.710> like<00:05:00.860> a<00:05:00.889> nose

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:01.130 
like this point point times like a nose

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:03.240 
like this point point times like a nose
right<00:05:01.430> here<00:05:01.610> we're<00:05:01.759> gonna<00:05:01.850> fold<00:05:02.120> that<00:05:02.270> under

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:03.250 
right here we're gonna fold that under

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:06.790 
right here we're gonna fold that under
it's<00:05:04.250> gonna<00:05:04.460> give<00:05:04.849> a<00:05:04.880> Slava<00:05:05.500> better<00:05:06.500> looking

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:06.800 
it's gonna give a Slava better looking

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:10.770 
it's gonna give a Slava better looking
head<00:05:06.949> and<00:05:08.169> now<00:05:09.169> he's<00:05:09.470> supposed<00:05:09.800> to<00:05:10.009> do

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:10.780 
head and now he's supposed to do

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:14.529 
head and now he's supposed to do
although<00:05:11.780> I<00:05:12.130> don't<00:05:13.130> really<00:05:13.340> do<00:05:13.580> it<00:05:13.610> supposed

00:05:14.529 --> 00:05:14.539 
although I don't really do it supposed

00:05:14.539 --> 00:05:18.089 
although I don't really do it supposed
to<00:05:15.190> take<00:05:16.190> these<00:05:16.460> corners<00:05:16.759> right<00:05:17.030> here

00:05:18.089 --> 00:05:18.099 
to take these corners right here

00:05:18.099 --> 00:05:20.409 
to take these corners right here
you're<00:05:19.099> supposed<00:05:19.400> to<00:05:19.460> tuck<00:05:19.699> those<00:05:19.849> under<00:05:20.240> but

00:05:20.409 --> 00:05:20.419 
you're supposed to tuck those under but

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:22.480 
you're supposed to tuck those under but
it<00:05:20.509> gets<00:05:20.690> really<00:05:20.960> difficult<00:05:21.259> when<00:05:21.919> it's<00:05:22.099> that

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:22.490 
it gets really difficult when it's that

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:25.900 
it gets really difficult when it's that
thick<00:05:22.870> so<00:05:23.870> I<00:05:23.900> just<00:05:24.289> try<00:05:24.440> to<00:05:24.669> you<00:05:25.669> see<00:05:25.880> what

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:25.910 
thick so I just try to you see what

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:29.200 
thick so I just try to you see what
looks<00:05:26.150> nice<00:05:26.360> instead<00:05:27.669> so<00:05:28.669> make<00:05:28.820> the<00:05:28.940> head<00:05:29.090> kind

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:29.210 
looks nice instead so make the head kind

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:34.879 
looks nice instead so make the head kind
of<00:05:29.330> look<00:05:29.419> like<00:05:29.479> however<00:05:29.900> you<00:05:30.199> want<00:05:30.410> to<00:05:30.440> make<00:05:30.620> it

00:05:34.879 --> 00:05:34.889 

00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:39.200 

there<00:05:35.460> we<00:05:35.610> go

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:39.210 

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:41.700 

kind<00:05:39.780> of<00:05:39.810> like<00:05:39.960> that

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:41.710 
kind of like that

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:45.220 
kind of like that
and<00:05:42.039> now<00:05:42.460> we<00:05:42.850> want<00:05:43.030> to<00:05:43.060> do<00:05:43.259> take

and now we want to do take
the<00:05:45.380> back<00:05:45.830> place<00:05:46.730> like<00:05:47.180> a<00:05:47.210> first<00:05:47.540> line<00:05:47.720> right

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:47.990 
the back place like a first line right

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:50.140 
the back place like a first line right
here

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:50.150 
here

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:54.360 
here
