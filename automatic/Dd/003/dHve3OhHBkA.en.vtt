00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:05.759
 well guys are matt revolution e 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.290
 welcome to this new video like 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.330
 you have read from the title you see 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.820
 in the image I am here with call of duty 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.710
 ghost boys because I just got back 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.289
 from games week 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:19.109
 thanks to eurogamer we had the 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:21.890
 possibility to try it in preview 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:25.590
 I must say that I did not expect it so 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:27.990
 really is a game in my opinion very much 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:31.849
 different than the one I expected 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.849
 very much better very beautiful 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:37.100
 unfortunately I won't show you more than 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:39.050
 five minutes per game because I ca n't 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.969
 not being able to register any more I will not be able to 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:43.489
 let you see beyond 

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:46.550
 but let's start right away then, first of all 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:51.379
 I was playing the vice mode in the 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:54.710
 tasm map I had now taken the here 

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:58.159
 subspecies of briefcase giving the mob 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:01:00.739
 I just believe that unfortunately they are not 

00:00:58.159 --> 00:01:03.760
 managed to complete the goal it gives 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:08.110
 a move in this case was to kill 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:10.930
 the two enemies with a weapon drawn on 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:14.439
 earth I didn't go out because obviously 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:16.000
 it is not something very much 

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:17.619
 easy to do 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.780
 can have my first game then 

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:21.520
 I didn't even know where to go 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:24.180
 honestly I never saw the map 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.180
 we know nothing 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:27.380
 I noticed well I'll show you some 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.170
 what's this 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:32.450
 however during this game play the c4 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:35.270
 noticed that it doesn't explode when you crush 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:39.799
 twice hicks 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:42.950
 I had the assault rewards no 

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:45.049
 assault sorry for support than just 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.600
 I changed my class to zero 

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:52.490
 however I had places contracted to there is 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:55.369
 some other things not in this 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:57.110
 gameplay in the next I will show you a 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:02:00.050
 a bit of rewards for what it really was 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:02.289
 nobody called practically 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:04.580
 high rewards 

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:06.950
 yes I want to say that I was not 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:09.920
 playing with poor people but for example 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:13.400
 against we had whose members of urania 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:15.530
 so it's not poor people but in fact 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:18.850
 no one has stood out among those who 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:18.850
 they have playing ok 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:26.000
 yes anyway I have to say that it's a nice game 

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:27.230
 they showed us nothing but the 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.050
 multiplayer 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:32.810
 but I was also interested a little in me 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:36.860
 follow the summer hicks mode from 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:39.050
 of extinction but we have not had the 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:43.209
 therefore possibility boys there is therefore 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:43.209
 I can only confirm this 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:50.680
 what else could I say until mode was 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:52.710
 a kind of capture of the flag only 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:55.540
 that instead of bringing back the flag 

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:59.650
 at the base you had to taste the base 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:02.380
 I don't know about the enemy's points 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:06.150
 how they were based I think every person who 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:06.150
 entered the base yes 

00:03:06.219 --> 00:03:12.500
 he gave me points then obviously I have here 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:14.030
 cut many parts because otherwise it lasted 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:17.780
 too much and they didn't let you load it 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:19.159
 in fact it is just 75 minutes but little 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:22.099
 anyway guys I noticed that yes 

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:23.719
 they can destroy many objects too 

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:25.969
 in this video I think I've done it 

00:03:23.719 --> 00:03:28.180
 to see a little also in the next I will do 

00:03:25.969 --> 00:03:28.180
 to see 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:33.349
 nothing I thought 

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:36.170
 I thought to say if I stay the game is 

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:39.709
 usually claudiu but having tried it 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:41.269
 I can't say it's not the usual though 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:43.280
 of profits among other things I also find a 

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:44.810
 bit more difficult but it will be because it is the 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.190
 first time and why I was trying 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:48.920
 also the xbox one 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:50.900
 so guys was another console i 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:53.629
 noted that even the triggers of the 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:55.549
 controllers a little different from another 

00:03:53.629 --> 00:04:00.859
 will live when they shoot you live i 

00:03:55.549 --> 00:04:03.709
 own triggers like other modes that 

00:04:00.859 --> 00:04:06.530
 I have tried sana frank head that I will make you 

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:10.670
 see later I do n't know when but in 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:14.269
 Following this video I am sorry to 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:17.209
 not having been able to show you the clans 

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:18.799
 the main menu of the classes 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:21.410
 multiplayer because they didn't do it 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:23.180
 however, register the weapons you are 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:26.539
 They can unlock there are very 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:29.180
 really a lot of guys I can only tell you 

00:04:26.539 --> 00:04:31.280
 this by the way here I have one 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:34.430
 sensitivity also very high and not 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:37.419
 could not change it I could not 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:43.610
 change it maybe I changed it during 

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:45.680
 during the video I don't remember them 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:49.669
 guys normally time is running out 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:52.970
 sorry no guys obviously will have 

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:54.860
 two more videos to upload and put where 

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:58.030
 we like many comments we feel 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:58.030
 to the next video bye
