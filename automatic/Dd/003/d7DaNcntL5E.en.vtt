 what I wanted to do when I was little and 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.960
 now this dream that has achieved so 

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:13.490
 big according to the producers more 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.110
 important music waters and tell us 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:19.870
 how long did you start this work 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:22.310
 with the music of charanga and two groups 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:25.190
 15-16 directly in the music no longer 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:27.110
 making music but you saw the prizes

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.670
 festivals of marqués imss around 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:34.670
 I was already fixing the horn 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:37.940
 is picking up carles damaging equipment all 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:40.550
 that round like that but that led you to be 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:42.350
 products suddenly does not think when 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:44.870
 small that did not police it to be 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:47.660
 doctor that led you to be a producer and 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:49.190
 new singers also more for the me 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:52.220
 I think for the blood viagra 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:54.650
 because the old musician is fine 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:56.330
 the grandfather - also the musician, as I 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:57.860
 I think that because of that line, all the 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.660
 family friend how do we tell you cousin a 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:03.680
 puncher conceived also there came in 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:06.110
 first store and that's how he arrived was taking 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:08.770
 the music also the urban genre as well 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:12.640
 around as d 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:17.410
 stopping from north to south and then like this 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:19.360
 it started copying does not understand 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:21.580
 singing the same as the other than what 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.930
 he listened to recording the cases and what 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.730
 is what they say was also this 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:27.100
 music in Spanish is not the same other 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:29.310
 we can understand it differently if 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:29.310
 you 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:33.910
 you believe that reality or so they say 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:35.740
 that the reggaeton is going to end that is going to 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:38.530
 reach its end or believe that they are already a 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:40.990
 immortal gender I really do not think that 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:43.770
 is going to record can evolve 20 40 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:46.060
 times but it's over and neither does 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:47.530
 generation is network where musicians 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:50.350
 well I think it will also be 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:52.720
 like that I like young all my life 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:54.820
 I already imagine a reggaetonero of these 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:57.160
 times to 15 20 years ago back to 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:03:00.280
 front said forgiveness was still listening 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:02.740
 after another has achieved something so simple 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:05.560
 with her caps and a dress with her 

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:06.910
 gender with your flower understand me I want 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.520
 I do not think I do not think it's over 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:12.130
 revolutions and evolve and they go they 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:14.230
 go wrong in 20 different ways but what 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:17.020
 that is over if I do not think it puts waters and 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:19.510
 tell us suddenly that producer that you 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:23.100
 you say one this bad is a burden to this evil 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:23.100
 I respect him I respect his work 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:28.180

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:30.400
