biggest<00:02:04.500> selling<00:02:04.979> point<00:02:05.250> I<00:02:05.580> don't<00:02:06.000> know<00:02:06.179> why

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:06.330 
biggest selling point I don't know why

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:07.969 
biggest selling point I don't know why
this<00:02:06.390> is<00:02:06.689> but<00:02:06.720> the<00:02:07.020> biggest<00:02:07.380> selling<00:02:07.649> point<00:02:07.860> is

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
this is but the biggest selling point is

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.850 
this is but the biggest selling point is
how<00:02:08.160> far<00:02:08.369> underwater<00:02:08.759> it<00:02:09.269> could<00:02:09.420> go<00:02:09.860> and

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
how far underwater it could go and

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.800 
how far underwater it could go and
they're<00:02:11.069> really<00:02:11.250> intense<00:02:11.849> about<00:02:12.030> that<00:02:12.390> like<00:02:12.599> I
