00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:09.890
 Leon's second all-round video is a boss fight. 

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:15.310
 Two bosses turned into defeated defenders, but if you are like yours now 

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:15.310
 I 'll try using Cloud Erica with me. 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:28.320
 Yes, I did it at 2x speed at first . 

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:31.630
 If the interval is 200,000 to 300,000, the play time is getting longer 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:35.620
 I've been in this mouth a long time. 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:38.030
 This is a double-speed boss pattern, 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:44.050
 When I was about 1per section 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:44.050
 I'll have to check first if geolro pepper speeds fast enough to be certain 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:51.730
 In the case of a wooden booth pattern 

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:56.550
 The attack took about six times and then 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:56.550
 The inclusions are summoned and the machine 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:11.830
 This pattern of meteorites and thorns seems to repeat itself. 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:18.060
 In the past, it came out as frequency continues and now we are starting from behind 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:18.060
 It's like a slime or a pattern coming out again. 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.860
 I've got a slime and a duck right now. 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:35.220
 We came out with a laugh and we came out with this watchman . 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:50.690
 So duck also because the movement speed reduction 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.690
 I think it's a good idea to hold it like this in a long distance . 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:08.710
 If you are taking things as I think the speed is getting faster, I saw it 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:08.710
 When I was over 200,000 people, the speed of things went up considerably. 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:17.900
 I thought I'd be a little disappointed, but now I got eight watchdogs. 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:21.340
 Originally it repeats over and over again. 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.340
 Looks like the pattern has changed a bit . 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:37.860
 I have some flip flops coming meteorite is so visible Trang then take out the 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:40.640
 To the house that comes out after the turn 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.640
 The pattern changed. 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:49.140
 The slime came out again, and I resolved the redemption again. 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:54.060
 I think this pattern is probably repeating. 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:03:00.210
 When I was just about 250,000 salts like this pattern will be the same case as far 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:03:03.320
 Quickly check this out to see how fast Bosch is. 

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:03.320
 I skipped. 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:14.300
 This case is also the primary 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:14.300
 The waterfall was nice and fast, but the patterns seem to be the same 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:24.910
 10 When the 16th minute passes , the silver boss increases in labor force g 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:24.910
 This put the score comes out poorly hadeoraguyo 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:33.210
 So it's a good idea to pull as many roads as you can in the beginning . 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:37.480
 toto 

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:41.849
 Oh, my playtime is about 12 minutes. 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:41.849
 This road is coming in as it is now. 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:54.940
 sweat 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:54.940
 Ah, I think the concentration is declining last year. 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:08.430
 It came out around 265,000 points moreugetgo well enough to spur one would turn right 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:08.430
 I will do the required video here.
