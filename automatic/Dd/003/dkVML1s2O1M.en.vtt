just<00:02:59.070> before<00:02:59.310> the<00:02:59.400> half<00:02:59.580> there<00:02:59.880> and<00:03:00.090> you<00:03:00.780> know

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
just before the half there and you know

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:02.120 
just before the half there and you know
they<00:03:00.990> gained<00:03:01.170> a<00:03:01.230> little<00:03:01.350> bit<00:03:01.440> of<00:03:01.530> momentum<00:03:01.680> but

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130
