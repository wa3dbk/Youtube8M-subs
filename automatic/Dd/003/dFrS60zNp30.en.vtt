that<00:00:58.829> was<00:00:59.300> was<00:01:00.300> challenging<00:01:00.870> but<00:01:00.989> at<00:01:01.079> the<00:01:01.140> same

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
that was was challenging but at the same

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.799 
that was was challenging but at the same
time<00:01:01.500> it<00:01:01.649> came<00:01:01.940> kind<00:01:02.940> of<00:01:03.149> natural<00:01:03.539> so<00:01:03.750> it

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
time it came kind of natural so it

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.509 
time it came kind of natural so it
wasn't<00:01:04.080> really<00:01:04.110> forced<00:01:04.710> and<00:01:04.979> I<00:01:05.040> think<00:01:05.339> that's

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
wasn't really forced and I think that's

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.899 
wasn't really forced and I think that's
what<00:01:05.700> made<00:01:05.909> it<00:01:05.960> easier<00:01:06.960> to<00:01:07.400> be<00:01:08.400> in<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:08.700> dance

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.820

it's not no is it really no I mean lifts
is<00:01:53.280> it<00:01:53.490> actually<00:01:54.060> is<00:01:54.180> easy<00:01:54.390> I<00:01:54.930> think<00:01:55.740> it's<00:01:56.040> to

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
is it actually is easy I think it's to

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.160 
is it actually is easy I think it's to
wrap<00:01:56.369> it<00:01:56.549> like<00:01:56.790> doing<00:01:57.030> a<00:01:57.210> repetition<00:01:57.630> of<00:01:57.930> them

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
wrap it like doing a repetition of them

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.440 
wrap it like doing a repetition of them
in<00:01:58.439> a<00:01:58.619> row<00:01:58.799> I<00:01:59.130> think<00:01:59.460> sometimes<00:01:59.880> makes<00:02:00.180> it<00:02:00.299> like

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
in a row I think sometimes makes it like

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.630 
in a row I think sometimes makes it like
oh<00:02:00.570> I<00:02:00.600> can<00:02:00.990> you<00:02:01.110> know<00:02:01.259> ik<00:02:01.409> village<00:02:02.219> I<00:02:02.310> kind<00:02:02.549> of
