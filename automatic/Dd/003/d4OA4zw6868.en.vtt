00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.920
 and war 2 guys and girls that just like 

00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:05.779
 you are today undefeated agents in our 

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:09.320
 little world here that we generate a lot of 

00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:12.800
 diamonds and well I'm in the version 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:14.809
 1.8 from minecraft and then in the video I 

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:16.970
 I want to teach a characteristic of 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:19.580
 minecraft 1.8 that I did not consider 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:21.380
 and it has made me very funny and that's why 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:24.640
 It's the one I wanted to share because 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:27.560
 it really looks really good and 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:29.330
 I do not know whether or called me a lot the 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:32.800
 attention because not earlier I do not know how 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:34.510
 was achieved and I've seen what 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:38.410
 and it can mole a lot and it has 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:40.960
 a lot of possibilities and we can 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:43.989
 open enough to quite a few new 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:45.610
 designs so let's go over there so 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:47.949
 someone wants to know why we support 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:50.199
 so many diamonds in our world what 

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:52.329
 you can see in the video I will leave you the 

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:54.489
 link the description and now yes 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:57.570
 we go there we go to what they came to 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:01:00.040
 explain today what is how to create or how 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.899
 appear heads of our character 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:03.670
 as for example that by the way seen 

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:05.950
 I have a balding face there 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:08.560
 up as for example is empty is 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:10.960
 the head of my skin as you see is 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:13.960
 the same buffet rib and then 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:17.229
 we can appear let's say that only 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:19.509
 may appear or at the moment I have only 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:23.350
 learned to appear with the command 

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:25.720
 but let's say you can 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:27.250
 then not then I suppose that only 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.600
 after appearing if you have activated 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:30.850
 tricks in your world 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:33.040
 in creating the world active tricks 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:35.740
 and you can execute a very cool command 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:38.229
 I'm going to hit you here and I'll leave you 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:40.090
 the description you see your gif bar 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:42.159
 minecraft name such as mine 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:44.229
 is to jean vÃ­ctor genes and three and then 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:47.020
 I'm equal minecraft two points school 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:48.550
 13 and here school owner here you have to 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:51.670
 put him 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:55.050
 the owner of the head for example 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:57.930
 if I put hardy 5 mg 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:02:00.030
 I would leave the head to leave neither 5 mg and the 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.220
 could put here by my side or by 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.800
 example could you put the head right that 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:05.760
 you want for example you can put here 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:09.520
 theory should work as per 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:12.100
 example of wii and rex 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:14.410
 you see give us all heads here and 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:18.220
 can be superchulo for topics of 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:21.370
 designs for both a survival or world 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:23.080
 a world let's say a server can be 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.790
 give a lot of money because now 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.140
 example on the servers what you have 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:28.810
 what to do install a plugin that is 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:31.270
 empty that you have to have an ally and 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:32.890
 why this option can be super 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:35.080
 cool and the truth is that you see the 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:37.750
 heads are identical to those of the 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:40.180
 from those to the owners by 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.650
 example that is to the same skins there 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:43.240
 some guys with this I say goodbye I hope 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:45.370
 that we are side a lot 

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:47.440
 this new feature is new 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:49.060
 minecraft feature by the way 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.910
 It breaks just like you break them with a 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.950
 peak to break them by hand 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:54.660
 I hope it has been delayed a lot 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.600
 it stands out cost I like your 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:59.490
 comments and nothing good this I say goodbye 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:02.270
 Greetings to all and see you in erosion 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:02.270
