00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:22.100 
steam and then gone back to other games
simply<00:05:20.309> because<00:05:20.699> it's<00:05:21.389> a<00:05:21.479> great<00:05:21.719> diversion

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:22.110

but<00:05:23.059> honestly<00:05:24.059> it's<00:05:24.360> not<00:05:24.599> much<00:05:24.839> more<00:05:25.110> I<00:05:26.930> don't

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:27.930

think<00:05:28.229> it's<00:05:28.349> fair<00:05:28.529> to<00:05:28.589> judge<00:05:28.949> deathmatch

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:29.490

really<00:05:32.099> represent<00:05:32.339> what<00:05:32.729> the<00:05:32.819> game<00:05:32.999> is<00:05:33.029> like

00:05:33.379 --> 00:05:33.389 
really represent what the game is like

00:05:33.389 --> 00:05:35.299

00:05:35.299 --> 00:05:35.309 
and whether or not you enjoy it I think

00:05:35.309 --> 00:05:37.850 
and whether or not you enjoy it I think
that<00:05:35.430> goes<00:05:35.580> for<00:05:35.819> all<00:05:35.849> games<00:05:36.149> rather<00:05:37.020> I<00:05:37.289> like<00:05:37.740> to

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:37.860 
that goes for all games rather I like to

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:39.439 
that goes for all games rather I like to
compare<00:05:38.099> games<00:05:38.399> to<00:05:38.580> other<00:05:38.729> games<00:05:39.120> at<00:05:39.389> the

00:05:39.439 --> 00:05:39.449 
compare games to other games at the

00:05:39.449 --> 00:05:41.360 
compare games to other games at the
similar<00:05:39.810> genre<00:05:39.839> so<00:05:40.620> you<00:05:40.680> can<00:05:40.830> have<00:05:40.979> an<00:05:41.039> idea<00:05:41.339> of

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:41.370 
similar genre so you can have an idea of

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:43.070 
similar genre so you can have an idea of
what<00:05:41.580> you<00:05:41.699> can<00:05:41.729> expect<00:05:41.849> when<00:05:42.479> you<00:05:42.779> play<00:05:42.930> the

game in deathmatch classics case if you

00:05:46.469 --> 00:05:48.050 
game in deathmatch classics case if you
like<00:05:46.620> games<00:05:46.830> like<00:05:47.099> unreal<00:05:47.430> tournament<00:05:47.699> and

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:48.060 
like games like unreal tournament and

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:51.739 
like games like unreal tournament and
quake<00:05:48.810> it's<00:05:49.709> really<00:05:50.099> more<00:05:50.249> of<00:05:50.339> the<00:05:50.459> same<00:05:50.749> that

00:05:51.739 --> 00:05:51.749 
quake it's really more of the same that

00:05:51.749 --> 00:05:53.300 
quake it's really more of the same that
said<00:05:52.020> I'd<00:05:52.139> probably<00:05:52.409> stick<00:05:52.830> with<00:05:52.860> those<00:05:53.129> two

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:53.310 
said I'd probably stick with those two

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:54.800 
said I'd probably stick with those two
games<00:05:53.520> because<00:05:53.999> they're<00:05:54.209> generally<00:05:54.539> more

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:54.810 
games because they're generally more

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:57.920 
games because they're generally more
rounded<00:05:55.289> and<00:05:55.439> more<00:05:55.680> complete<00:05:56.039> games<00:05:56.749> but<00:05:57.749> if

00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:57.930 
rounded and more complete games but if

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:00.199 
rounded and more complete games but if
you're<00:05:58.110> after<00:05:58.229> something<00:05:58.349> new<00:05:58.889> or<00:05:59.610> if<00:05:59.999> you've
