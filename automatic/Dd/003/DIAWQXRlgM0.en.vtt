00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:31.700
 I had a very nice time 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:33.860
 played before I was 50 to 12 years old 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.890

 fun things to do in life and also 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10.680
 to invoke 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:13.770

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:15.420

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:17.370
