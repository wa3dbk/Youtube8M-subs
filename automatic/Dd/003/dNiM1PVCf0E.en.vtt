 openings should be the second 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.820
 video here so go there I would say 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.189
 immediately of getting lost in talk that 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.930
 I've already talked for a minute without it 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.180
 open nothing then or have ours 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.189
 last 5 fantozzi that I remember them 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.439
 I take and before this box is enjoyed 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.610
 this is full and this is what he wants 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.340
 obviously because these were the 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.720
 last 100 packages no boys 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.720
 we begin immediately to open these 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:27.570
 packages from vice of calculations are not 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.439
 are the sets are exact I can say 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.500
 exact lol 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:33.509
 we should still find a full art o 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.579
 maybe another ex but we have to be 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.270
 just overshadowed the kids because in 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.280
 this box 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.619
 boys from ex were all at the bottom 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.950
 damn all at the bottom who maybe 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:47.100
 now we find a nice scarf maybe 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.869
 come on maybe they are rare to find 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.840
 boys these sketches were not art 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:53.840
 view very few so we put 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.790
 always in focus 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.799
 ok we focused then we find 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.799

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:04.649

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:06.689
 call to big ping skates 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:08.729
 finally a flop and the hollow boys that 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:11.220
 it never really hurts really 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.980
 wonderful that we lacked so we didn't 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.180
 complain 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:18.159
 the boys say it in all the videos 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:20.590
 when i find ex pro find ex excuse 

00:02:18.159 --> 00:02:22.299
 theolo that you also lack prison 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:25.690
 municipalities that I miss are always good 

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:30.160
 because I repeat I have to finish 7 so it does 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:31.239
 nothing is like that, but I find carte d'or area but 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.060
 however I miss them 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:35.410
 then almost the 17th code here 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.760
 let's make a click 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:39.700

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:49.840
 then we have to stand these slang but 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:51.220
 energy in Cuba and finally an encore 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.900

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:55.930
 package kids we had pretty much 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:59.049
 all this so I would say it 's great 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:00.849
 from we continue that then the boys would like 

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:03.010

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:06.040

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:34.750
 packages from another ex from the three ex a 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:37.450
 box is everything but at least whose art 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:39.519

 daily having to or even hol 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:04.750
 double the pilot I do 22 of a box 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:06.819
 guys because it breathes age force into the 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:09.099
 which for example I had only taken 

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:11.109
 a box and the time 7 was not successful 

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:14.230
 to finish a last package guys 

00:04:11.109 --> 00:04:16.419
 let's see if this box gives us 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:20.549
 even a full art or maybe another ex 

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:22.870

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:29.070

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:31.570
 i challenge this is i remember slug but 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:33.220
 little drink maybe it's a volleys boys 

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:35.320
 I don't know I don't know I don't know it's a role 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:36.100
 that we already had boys for 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:37.270
 this box 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:39.699
 we have all opened all the packages 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:42.220
 we are really in this box guys 

00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:43.479
 scrauso I can say yes because in all 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:45.639
 the openings I've seen on youtube 

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:48.130
 nobody had found only two exes and me 

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:50.350
 incidentally found the two exes really 

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:51.970
 lucky faithful as always leave a 

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:55.419
 I like a comment sign up 

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:57.639
 really nothing for his box I would say 

00:04:55.419 --> 00:04:59.910
 who went to the boys decently 

00:04:57.639 --> 00:05:02.229
 we found several or not 

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:04.030
 will go a little on the internet to look for the 

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:06.789
 average because no, maybe I find it more 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:08.650
 role and therefore they put me less ex 

00:05:06.789 --> 00:05:10.330
 box it will give but surely 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:12.610
 powers there was a full art boys o 

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:14.380
