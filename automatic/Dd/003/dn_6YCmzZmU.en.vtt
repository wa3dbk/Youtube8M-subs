00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:06.839
 anderson viegas spent most of 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:09.630
 without thinking that he could suffer 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:12.570
 some kind of difficulties 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:15.299
 the scholarly worker who is 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.139
 of course always dedicated to your 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.100
 family 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:23.460
 however in June 2008 the life of this 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:26.670
 boy radically changed his dreams 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.599
 desires and granddaughters have become 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.160
 tears 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:33.719
 but giving up was never an option 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.399
 I had to go through the situation of having 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.840
 to adapt to a wheelchair 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.160
 the doctor said that I was going to walk again 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.640
 that was going to have to go through several 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.570
 surgeries and that I would be able to 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.399
 walking that has a totally life 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.450
 independent from that moment I 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.280
 did not accept 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.510
 I kept fighting I had help from 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.719
 several people who have been by my side 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:54.090
 and today I came back to walk I 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.890
 get enough now to strengthen the 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.270
 I want to show people that nothing 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.510
 It's impossible because everyone was talking 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:02.340
 for me that it was impossible to conquer or 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.629
 The things that I wanted and I showed to 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.070
 everyone that nothing is impossible that 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.860
 every day more I'm conquering every 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.350
 More space and a smile 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:13.770
 Janderson shows that his will to 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:17.369
 living is much greater than before your history 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:20.490
 motivation inspires many 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:23.970
 people and proves that without 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:26.490
 normal I always looked for is to find a 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.829
 means of helping people from 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.930
 be able to show people that each 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.770
 can be motivated to overcome within 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.600
 said 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.270
 So I've always tried to find a 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.520
 means of strengthening more and more 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.200
 the support of many people in my 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:44.079
 mother physical therapists from around the world 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:46.539
 and motivation it came naturally to me 

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:48.280
 I believe that the more I 

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:51.700
 I was more discouraged people were going to help me 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:54.429
 and I create more strength for this 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:56.860
 as well as many already Anderson too 

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:59.020
 longs for some dreams 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:01.899
 one of them is to participate in the Paralympic Games 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:04.390
 2016 

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:05.890
 there is actually I had this dream 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:08.979
 when I was in the hospital 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:10.539
 I was swimming and then I started to 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:14.590
 look for some places that 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:17.410
 swimming is for the disabled i found 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.819
 in some places and even before 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:20.349
 start training many people already 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:22.810
 started with that expectation that 

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:24.400
 I was going to be a promise a revelation and 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:26.349
 certain pressure was already coming to her, but 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.970
 a person with good pressure that I 

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:30.310
 I knew I would have to have this 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:31.870
 responsibility continues to train today 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:34.630
 I'm training for the competition 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:36.519
 that will have but here in Manaus is the step 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:38.500
 north and northeast of the circuit box 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:40.170
 I 'm training hard and it's going to be 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:42.459
 my first competition I believe that 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.019
 It's going to be the first of many I'm 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:46.600
 trained enough to get strong in the 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:48.370
 competition is in June hit the stage 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.510
 brazilian championship goes 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:52.329
 also participate in it 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:55.239
 during the conversation with the young man he 

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:57.579
 explains and makes it clear that if today 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:03:00.220
 he is alive and happy 

00:02:57.579 --> 00:03:04.019
 everything is dedicated to family and friends 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:06.910
 because at no time was he unleashed 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:10.000
 so I owe them everything that the 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:12.730
 that I conquered today is every 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.350
 part of my story is thanks to them. 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:17.650
 so I just have to thank everybody 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:19.239
 that helped me a lot and now is to look 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:20.109
 more and more people who cheer for 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:23.290
 me 

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:25.590
 anderson viegas needed motivation 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:27.370
 enough to be in physical therapy 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:30.700
 daily 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:33.579
 the boy underwent several surgeries 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:36.260
 then it is necessary to have an accompaniment 

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:38.540
 more specialized 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:40.760
 The game's just a challenge for me like 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:43.610
 physiotherapist like a pro 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:46.069
 his return to social life, I no longer 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:48.860
 I know when he had the injury he thought 

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:50.599
 that he was not going to walk in a moment 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:53.720
 the scare came 

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:56.239
 but at first with the conversation with 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:57.470
 the motivation he understood that the 

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:58.970
 get him back on the floor 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:01.879
 then physiotherapy was very 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:04.879
 importance in jan jani will be dedicated 

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:08.480
 so important all this is people who 

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:12.200
 love close ne family to family always 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:15.290
 giving support not motivating friends 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:17.989
 also today and he's walking today he 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:21.019
 is at the stage of protecting the action is where the 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:23.690
 You are doing the support to 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:25.460
 Overloads already the game is already walking 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:28.490
 without crutch is already working with 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:30.680
 balance the evolution after a 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:31.430
 year of treatment a little margin 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:34.820
 year 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:37.490
 young people are also today the young man is 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:39.680
 in a highly evolved phase 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:43.039
 he can already work more with 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:45.199
 balance so never leave any 

00:04:43.039 --> 00:04:49.099
 limit takes you away 

00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:50.750
 the ambition of self overcoming things 

00:04:49.099 --> 00:04:54.530
 most important in life are in the 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:56.150
 Simple things then I got to life 

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:58.340
 In another way, he started to thank 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:59.720
 For all I have I've started walking 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:01.789
 value to the people who are on my side 

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:02.960
 today that we never know how it is 

00:05:01.789 --> 00:05:04.220
 It's going to be tomorrow. 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:06.650
 So I thank everyone who 

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:10.310
 It helped a lot, it's my family. 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:12.139
 mother the father my mother my uncles and all 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:14.960
 world that helped me my cousins ​​who 

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:16.250
 always been with me I know nothing 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:17.810
 this would be possible if it were not 

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:21.940
 with them is to have said that the family is the 

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:24.590
 base of everything and that I know I can 

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:26.300
 or I can go through several difficulties 

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:27.470
 in my life but have always been 

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:29.650
 with me I know I will overcome any 

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:29.650
 thing
