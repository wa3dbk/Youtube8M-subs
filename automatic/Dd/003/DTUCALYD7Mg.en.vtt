00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:06.690
 hi friends we are on the banks of 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.700
 cantalice for a new session of 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.559
 fishing we have already fallen and dog 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.599
 beaten has already done 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.610
 what we had to do is a time 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.369
 dead and we take advantage of this time 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.350
 died to show you a new product of 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.869
 of course, the house card 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:25.680
 area we are talking about a backpack one 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:28.050
 door and small backpack that can be 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.750
 used both for fast sessions of 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.250
 fishing both for foreign sections or 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.640
 assists long sessions where we have 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.620
 need a lot of small parts as I said 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.370
 previously and then a deckchair has the 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:44.370
 typical transport mechanism through 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:47.430
 shoulder straps or by handle 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.860
 conventional conventional is equipped with 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.960
 three distinct sections each of the 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.899
 which can accommodate several cassettes of 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.969
 small parts for the high part one for 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.800
 part while for the lower part two 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.510
 boxes of small items that are thirsty 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.660
 conventional that a bit all companies 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:06.330
 what they do is already supplied with one 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:10.979
 this is the case for small parts 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:14.310
 item is held together is joined by two 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:16.380
 special clips that you just need to release for 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.439
 going to open in this way 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.650
 when we go to open ours 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:26.159
 our backpack we have available 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:28.799
 bank one two three four sections which 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:30.869
 each section can host just like 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:33.210
 I said earlier or a cassette of 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.960
 small parts or any other 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.460
 low component of the line of 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:40.740
 coal baggage just to make a 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:44.970
 example just open with a special one 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:47.250
 zipper with a part and can accommodate us 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:51.180
 quietly of the cars hack as 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:53.930
 this case or a lead door that 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.930
 as in this case 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:02.250
 as I said before, every pocket is 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:07.479
 designed to house boxes 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:12.280
 strong small parts in fact for example mi 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:15.720
 I take this at the end of this one 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:19.209
 it is precisely the box that is already born 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:23.680
 with the backpack 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:25.989
 just open it this way it's inside 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:29.190
 can host any of our components 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:33.120
 of small parts that we need 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:36.670
 new product made by jesi negri 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:38.500
 available from stores from the middle 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:42.370
 at the end of October 2013 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:44.860
 you can find it in all the stores they sell 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:46.930
 our brand really has a price 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:48.790
 really competitive 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:50.920
 I personally used it in 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:54.430
 several different bled scene sessions here 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:55.930
 singer in corbara and I found myself 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.600
 really really good just because 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:00.600
 manages to accommodate with a single 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:03.850
 solution all I need 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:07.239
 for a fishing session whether it is 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:09.880
 fast whether it is durable in addition to 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:11.709
 this is to say that the comfort of the 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:13.239
 backpack made this way is 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:16.930
 the detail is also very practical 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:18.489
 because if we use a tent a place 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:20.590
 a simple I give a place which can 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:23.380
 be a fast bv a closer to the line 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:25.600
 In case of course this can go 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:28.359
 quietly to insert shop of 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:32.440
 bed once we have executed 

00:03:28.359 --> 00:03:33.850
 our operations to lower the plains 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.239
 or any of our operations we have 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:37.180
 need 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:38.709
 or for the realization of the terminals a 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:40.690
 new product so that as I said in 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:42.600
 previously found in all the stores that 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:44.019
 they distribute the brand that is right 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:46.920
 thanks for everything 

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:46.920
 see you next time
