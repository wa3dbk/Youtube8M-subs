 the hamburger cupcakes first 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.720
 until you need any browning that 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.460

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.800

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.570
 just follow the instructions in the box 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:34.810

 lend it and fill it with the mixture 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:40.380
 Finally, bake for 15 minutes 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.720
 to decorate the hamburger cupcakes 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.360
 you will also need bluefin tuna 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.970
 yellow and green and also a little bit of 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.039
 sesame seeds to create colored bitumen 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.619
 just gave me a gel dye to 

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:54.929
 food in a vanilla bitumen since 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:57.020

00:01:54.929 --> 00:02:00.270
 it's time to put together the hamburgers 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:02.820
 first cut the cupcake into three parts 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.470
 this will be the bread of the hamburger use 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.390
 a circular mold to cut the 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:09.000
 branding this will be the meat in the 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:11.459
 cupcake now puts the piece of brownie 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.709

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:16.410
 create the show xaus the yellow bitumen 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:18.420
 you can use a doubt like mine to 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:21.150
 create the same lettuces with the bitumen 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:23.069
 green and to create the little houses the same 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.319

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:28.049
 top of the cupcake and press 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:30.180

 They are so funny and they look so real 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:40.489
 and the best part is that they are delicious 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:42.260
 in a real hamburger but nobody 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:44.629
 will know that they are sweet until what 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.640

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:55.159
 you're going to need any mixture of 

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:57.230
 sugar cookies that you like 

00:02:55.159 --> 00:02:59.170
