Hello and welcome to
the whisky channel!

00:00:02.001 --> 00:00:05.001
Today, we'll do an Evolution Episode.
It's been a while.

00:00:05.002 --> 00:00:07.002
This time with two japanese whiskies.

00:00:07.003 --> 00:00:09.003
This is the first time
on the whisky channel.

00:00:09.038 --> 00:00:12.003
Taketsusu 12 yo and 17 yo.

00:00:15.004 --> 00:00:17.004
The first one is bottled at 40% ABV.

00:00:18.005 --> 00:00:21.105
The second one, at 43% ABV.

00:00:23.106 --> 00:00:25.106
They are Nikka products.

00:00:26.107 --> 00:00:28.107
Founded in 1953

00:00:28.108 --> 00:00:31.108
by the father of japanese whisky:

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.109
Masataka Taketsuru.

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:35.110
But the story begins earlier.

00:00:35.111 --> 00:00:38.111
In 1918, this chemistry student

00:00:38.112 --> 00:00:42.112
has this trip to Scotland to learn the
art and science of Scottish whisky.

00:00:42.113 --> 00:00:44.113
He gets married to a Scottish lady.

00:00:44.114 --> 00:00:48.114
and comes back later to japan
to found Yoichi distillery.

00:00:48.115 --> 00:00:51.115
Nikka owns a second distillery.
Miyagikyo distillery.

00:00:51.116 --> 00:00:54.116
This one was built later, in 1969.

00:00:55.117 --> 00:00:58.117
Both distilleries release single malts
under their own name.

00:00:58.118 --> 00:01:02.118
With these two whiskies, we have
what we call a pure malt,

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:04.119
as written on the label.

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:06.120
It's actually a blend of single malts,

00:01:06.121 --> 00:01:10.121
from Yoichi and Miyagikyo distilleries,
in that particular case.

00:01:10.122 --> 00:01:14.122
The words Pure Malt have almost
disappeared from the labels now,

00:01:14.123 --> 00:01:17.123
because they are now considered
ambiguous for the consumer.

00:01:17.124 --> 00:01:19.124
We now use the words Blended Malt,

00:01:19.125 --> 00:01:21.125
which aren't clearer, by the way.

00:01:22.126 --> 00:01:25.126
Interesting fact,
Japan is obviously an island

00:01:25.127 --> 00:01:27.127
and therefore has little farmland.

00:01:27.128 --> 00:01:29.128
So barley is rather scarce.

00:01:29.129 --> 00:01:33.129
ans doesn't fulfill the needs
for japanese whisky production,

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:34.130
Nikka's needs in particular.

00:01:34.131 --> 00:01:38.131
Therefore, Nikka imports
its barley from Scotland

00:01:38.132 --> 00:01:39.132
and Australia.

00:01:39.133 --> 00:01:42.133
You'll have a thought
for you carbon assessment

00:01:42.134 --> 00:01:45.134
the next time you'll buy a Nikka product.

00:01:45.135 --> 00:01:48.135
But don't overthink. It's tasting time!

00:01:50.136 --> 00:01:51.136
For the 12 yo,

00:01:53.137 --> 00:01:55.137
Flowers on the nose,

00:01:55.138 --> 00:01:57.138
along with cereals,

00:01:57.139 --> 00:02:00.139
cereals which are becoming
bigger and bigger with time.

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.140
They almost cover up the flowers in the end.

00:02:06.141 --> 00:02:07.141
For the 17 yo,

00:02:09.142 --> 00:02:13.142
Powerful flowers and fruits on the nose,

00:02:13.143 --> 00:02:16.143
you already get them in the distance.

00:02:16.144 --> 00:02:20.144
Maturity, gained for the
extra five years in casks,

00:02:20.145 --> 00:02:23.145
is felt through a warmer nose,

00:02:23.146 --> 00:02:26.146
along with caramel and butterscotch.

00:02:26.147 --> 00:02:30.147
And you have wood on top of the cereals.

00:02:30.148 --> 00:02:32.148
And a hint of vanilla.

00:02:34.149 --> 00:02:35.149
The 12 yo, on the palate,

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:44.150
Very honeyed,

00:02:45.151 --> 00:02:46.151
delicately spicy,

00:02:46.152 --> 00:02:50.152
It's only 40% ABV but it has
a powerful mouthfeel.

00:02:50.153 --> 00:02:54.153
It's one of my first
whiskies and it has been

00:02:54.154 --> 00:02:56.154
one of the "strongest" that I've had,

00:02:56.155 --> 00:02:59.155
despite it low alcohol percentage.

00:02:59.156 --> 00:03:01.156
Quite some wood in the finish,

00:03:01.157 --> 00:03:03.157
along with spices,

00:03:03.158 --> 00:03:05.158
and some flowers on the retroolfaction.

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:07.159
As for the 17 yo,

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:08.160
on the palate,

00:03:17.161 --> 00:03:18.161
Spices,

00:03:18.162 --> 00:03:19.162
wood,

00:03:20.163 --> 00:03:22.163
a hint of salt,

00:03:23.164 --> 00:03:25.164
very long finish,

00:03:25.165 --> 00:03:28.165
with a lovely oak touch,

00:03:28.166 --> 00:03:30.166
vanilla,

00:03:30.167 --> 00:03:33.167
and later, the flowers
come back with a vengence!

00:03:33.168 --> 00:03:34.168
We've come full circle.

00:03:37.169 --> 00:03:39.169
You can find the 12 yo
in some department stores,

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:42.170
at around 30-35 Ç.

00:03:42.171 --> 00:03:44.171
Rather 40Ç elsewhere.

00:03:44.172 --> 00:03:46.172
As for the Taketsuru 17 yo,

00:03:46.173 --> 00:03:48.173
it is sold at around 100Ç.

00:03:48.174 --> 00:03:50.174
See you on a next episode!
