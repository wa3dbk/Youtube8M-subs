00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
 hello today I'm going to teach you how to make a 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.000
 snack for school 

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:12.360
 imagine they have gymnastics at 3 o'clock 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:15.269
 late if a nap at 3 now the 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.730
 school we're going to have to eat something in 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:21.710
 my school gives snack but they are not very 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.710
 We are going to put some cookies 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:30.759
 some gummies but before going to the gym 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.820
 of hunger 

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:38.970
 let's put a piece of miren iza 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:38.970
 and if they want to make a piece of rice 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.840
 how can you put a piece of bread 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:54.420
 something to combine with the you can eat 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:54.420
 well, afterwards, the truth is that is all 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:07.160
 water or whatever we want to take me to 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:11.300
 I do not know what I'm going to eat, let's see 

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:15.460
 how he prepared it in the well-grasped bowl 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.460
 the napkin I put one like this 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.530
 bent 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:28.450
 first I put the cookies I want 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:31.170
 wear this because they come 5 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:31.170
 the toy 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.659
 and now if I go back 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:40.810
 and there are others not 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.810
 it's like that 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:53.190
 this as if I had fit in there the 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:55.409
 thing is to send the milanesas so that 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:58.729
 it contracted two 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.729
 but nothing more 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.840
 and the global hand 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:06.380
 good there 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:13.420
 the water was to bring a reduction to 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:17.010
 I bought the little bottle 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:17.010
 this would be my medians 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:22.910
 and for a few days you do not want to stay 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:25.100
 a meal because by martÃ­n was born as 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:28.300
 an apple but it's like that 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:32.810
 while training this good in 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:34.730
 now it's a threat helps you with 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:38.840
 Energy 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:41.480
 if you do not like gymnastics eat 123 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:44.959
 something sweet gives you more energy to be able 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:48.260
 keep selling the water takes turns 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:50.659
 with the shots a little and the gym 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.450
 do not fear because it is very hard sometime 

00:02:50.659 --> 00:02:56.360

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:57.920
 run jogging at the same time and that already 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:01.340
 they study with shadow that as in the 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:05.769
