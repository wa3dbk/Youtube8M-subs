character or her to do they always been

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.960 
character or her to do they always been
here<00:01:28.200> yeah<00:01:28.470> they<00:01:28.619> have<00:01:28.770> always<00:01:28.920> been<00:01:29.490> on<00:01:29.940> the

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
here yeah they have always been on the

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.609 
here yeah they have always been on the
island<00:01:30.360> but<00:01:30.600> the<00:01:31.170> numbers<00:01:31.470> have<00:01:31.590> been

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
island but the numbers have been

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.190 
island but the numbers have been
suppressed<00:01:32.210> obviously<00:01:33.210> due<00:01:33.509> to<00:01:33.539> cats<00:01:34.020> and

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
suppressed obviously due to cats and

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.719 
suppressed obviously due to cats and
rats<00:01:34.470> having<00:01:34.920> been<00:01:35.250> on<00:01:35.369> the<00:01:35.490> island

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
rats having been on the island

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.910 
rats having been on the island
historically<00:01:36.360> why<00:01:36.869> if<00:01:36.929> they<00:01:37.050> don't<00:01:37.229> so<00:01:37.440> well<00:01:37.649> I

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
historically why if they don't so well I

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.660 
historically why if they don't so well I
guess<00:01:38.159> because<00:01:38.460> little<00:01:38.819> barriers<00:01:39.229> got<00:01:40.229> such<00:01:40.440> a

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
guess because little barriers got such a

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.120 
guess because little barriers got such a
different<00:01:41.670> range<00:01:41.850> of<00:01:42.530> forest<00:01:43.530> types<00:01:43.770> in<00:01:44.009> it

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
different range of forest types in it

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.010 
different range of forest types in it
that<00:01:44.670> they<00:01:44.850> can<00:01:45.119> move<00:01:45.390> up<00:01:45.569> and<00:01:45.720> down<00:01:45.840> the

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
that they can move up and down the

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.770 
that they can move up and down the
island<00:01:46.380> due<00:01:47.310> to<00:01:47.399> seasonal<00:01:47.580> food<00:01:48.060> what<00:01:48.599> do<00:01:48.720> you

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
island due to seasonal food what do you

eat
they<00:01:49.920> do<00:01:49.979> a<00:01:50.160> range<00:01:50.399> of<00:01:50.580> things<00:01:50.729> we<00:01:51.509> have<00:01:51.720> you

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229
