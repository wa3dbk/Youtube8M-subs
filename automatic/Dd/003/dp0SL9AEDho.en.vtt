00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890

out<00:01:13.979> of<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.159> question<00:01:14.240> yeah<00:01:15.240> i<00:01:15.270> think<00:01:15.720> that

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:16.280 
out of the question yeah i think that

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.010 
out of the question yeah i think that
the<00:01:17.280> two<00:01:17.640> guys<00:01:17.880> are<00:01:18.090> so<00:01:18.360> different<00:01:18.689> and<00:01:18.960> so

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
the two guys are so different and so

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.510 
the two guys are so different and so
distinct<00:01:19.619> and<00:01:19.740> what<00:01:19.860> they<00:01:19.979> do<00:01:20.040> and<00:01:20.250> what<00:01:20.310> their

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
distinct and what they do and what their

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:21.679 
distinct and what they do and what their
strengths<00:01:20.850> are<00:01:21.000> that<00:01:21.030> i<00:01:21.210> would<00:01:21.450> i<00:01:21.630> would

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
strengths are that i would i would

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:22.940 
strengths are that i would i would
envision<00:01:22.110> that<00:01:22.380> there<00:01:22.530> would<00:01:22.619> be<00:01:22.650> a<00:01:22.740> chance

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
envision that there would be a chance

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.499

something<00:01:23.189> like<00:01:23.340> that<00:01:23.520> could<00:01:23.610> happen<00:01:23.670> it

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
something like that could happen it

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.330 
something like that could happen it
might<00:01:24.659> be<00:01:24.810> a<00:01:24.840> good<00:01:24.869> duo<00:01:25.140> so<00:01:25.470> we<00:01:25.830> don't<00:01:26.009> know<00:01:26.130> yet

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
might be a good duo so we don't know yet

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.560 
might be a good duo so we don't know yet
and<00:01:26.400> will<00:01:26.820> kind<00:01:27.060> of<00:01:27.119> see<00:01:27.240> how<00:01:27.299> it<00:01:27.390> goes

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
and will kind of see how it goes

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.749

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
going to win the job I think Riley

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:46.080 
going to win the job I think Riley
Nelson<00:03:44.709> will<00:03:45.010> be<00:03:45.069> the<00:03:45.190> one<00:03:45.340> that<00:03:45.489> does<00:03:45.669> it<00:03:45.849> but

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.090 
Nelson will be the one that does it but

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:47.610 
Nelson will be the one that does it but
if<00:03:46.540> it<00:03:46.690> were<00:03:46.810> me<00:03:46.959> I<00:03:46.989> think<00:03:47.230> you'd<00:03:47.349> go<00:03:47.440> with<00:03:47.470> a

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:47.620 
if it were me I think you'd go with a

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:49.259 
if it were me I think you'd go with a
two-quarterback<00:03:48.099> system<00:03:48.609> exactly<00:03:49.120> what

00:03:49.259 --> 00:03:49.269 
two-quarterback system exactly what

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:51.150 
two-quarterback system exactly what
floor<00:03:49.510> did<00:03:49.630> in<00:03:49.870> 2006<00:03:50.470> they<00:03:50.620> want<00:03:50.799> a<00:03:50.829> national

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:51.160 
floor did in 2006 they want a national

00:03:56.169 --> 00:03:57.750

I<00:03:56.530> think<00:03:56.739> a<00:03:56.769> two-quarterback<00:03:57.190> system<00:03:57.579> could

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:57.760 
I think a two-quarterback system could

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.059 
I think a two-quarterback system could
work<00:03:57.910> with<00:03:58.060> BYU<00:03:58.419> well<00:03:58.870> next<00:03:59.049> week<00:03:59.349> you'll<00:03:59.889> have

a lefty ones RIT one has a little

quarterbacks<00:04:14.560> in<00:04:14.680> the<00:04:14.769> country<00:04:14.829> right<00:04:15.250> out<00:04:15.430> of

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:15.459 
quarterbacks in the country right out of

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:16.069

yeah<00:04:16.319> and<00:04:16.379> three<00:04:16.739> of<00:04:16.829> the<00:04:16.949> four<00:04:17.400> linebackers

00:04:17.629 --> 00:04:17.639

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:19.640 
yeah and three of the four linebackers
are<00:04:18.060> going<00:04:18.209> to<00:04:18.269> be<00:04:18.359> brand<00:04:18.629> new<00:04:18.750> and<00:04:19.079> mobile

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:19.650 
are going to be brand new and mobile

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:20.990 
are going to be brand new and mobile
quarterbacks<00:04:20.069> caused<00:04:20.459> some<00:04:20.669> problems<00:04:20.759> for

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
quarterbacks caused some problems for

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.939 
quarterbacks caused some problems for
BYU<00:04:21.329> in<00:04:21.539> the<00:04:21.629> past<00:04:21.810> especially<00:04:22.109> last<00:04:22.590> year<00:04:22.830> but

00:04:22.939 --> 00:04:22.949 
BYU in the past especially last year but

00:04:22.949 --> 00:04:24.619 
BYU in the past especially last year but
I<00:04:22.979> think<00:04:23.069> it<00:04:23.310> helps<00:04:23.460> that<00:04:23.939> especially<00:04:24.389> in<00:04:24.449> fall

00:04:24.619 --> 00:04:24.629 
I think it helps that especially in fall

00:04:24.629 --> 00:04:25.760 
I think it helps that especially in fall
camp<00:04:24.659> they've<00:04:25.080> been<00:04:25.169> able<00:04:25.259> to<00:04:25.409> practice

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:25.770 
camp they've been able to practice

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:27.499 
camp they've been able to practice
against<00:04:26.189> Riley<00:04:26.520> Nelson<00:04:26.669> who<00:04:26.969> himself<00:04:27.120> is<00:04:27.449> a

00:04:27.499 --> 00:04:27.509 
against Riley Nelson who himself is a

00:04:27.509 --> 00:04:29.089 
against Riley Nelson who himself is a
mobile<00:04:27.719> quarterback<00:04:28.199> right<00:04:28.379> so<00:04:28.650> the<00:04:28.770> defense

00:04:29.089 --> 00:04:29.099 
mobile quarterback right so the defense

00:04:29.099 --> 00:04:30.800 
mobile quarterback right so the defense
is<00:04:29.250> getting<00:04:29.490> better<00:04:29.610> by<00:04:29.969> playing<00:04:30.270> against<00:04:30.659> a

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:30.810 
is getting better by playing against a

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:31.999 
is getting better by playing against a
mobile<00:04:31.110> quarterback<00:04:31.469> that's<00:04:31.650> on<00:04:31.770> their<00:04:31.919> own
