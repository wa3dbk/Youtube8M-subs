00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
came for like seven to six hours and I

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.490 
came for like seven to six hours and I
figured<00:01:36.150> at<00:01:36.270> that<00:01:36.420> point<00:01:36.689> it<00:01:37.170> was<00:01:37.290> time<00:01:37.470> to

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
figured at that point it was time to

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.050 
figured at that point it was time to
quit<00:01:37.799> and<00:01:37.829> make<00:01:38.040> a<00:01:38.070> new<00:01:38.220> character<00:01:38.430> because<00:01:38.939> if

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
quit and make a new character because if

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.700 
quit and make a new character because if
you<00:01:39.180> start<00:01:39.600> falling<00:01:39.990> asleep<00:01:40.290> all<00:01:40.470> training

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
you start falling asleep all training

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.340 
you start falling asleep all training
class<00:01:41.040> it's<00:01:41.759> not<00:01:41.909> that<00:01:42.090> fun<00:01:42.270> anymore<00:01:42.509> and<00:01:42.869> I

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
class it's not that fun anymore and I

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:44.569 
class it's not that fun anymore and I
think<00:01:43.530> it's<00:01:43.649> time<00:01:43.799> for<00:01:43.829> a<00:01:44.009> change<00:01:44.189> at<00:01:44.460> that

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
think it's time for a change at that

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.440 
think it's time for a change at that
point<00:01:44.960> for<00:01:45.960> my<00:01:46.049> prior<00:01:46.320> experiences<00:01:47.100> and

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
point for my prior experiences and

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:50.210 
point for my prior experiences and
decisions<00:01:48.450> I<00:01:48.659> wanted<00:01:49.140> to<00:01:49.200> choose<00:01:49.590> a<00:01:49.649> class<00:01:49.890> now

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
decisions I wanted to choose a class now

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.149 
decisions I wanted to choose a class now
that<00:01:50.369> I<00:01:50.399> could<00:01:50.579> stick<00:01:50.759> for<00:01:50.939> a<00:01:50.970> while<00:01:52.159> seeing

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
that I could stick for a while seeing

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.520 
that I could stick for a while seeing
that<00:01:53.189> Archer<00:01:53.820> gear<00:01:54.060> the<00:01:54.570> only<00:01:54.750> classes<00:01:55.020> left

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
that Archer gear the only classes left

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.499 
that Archer gear the only classes left
were<00:01:55.770> to<00:01:56.159> make<00:01:56.310> for<00:01:56.490> a<00:01:56.549> bow<00:01:56.759> master<00:01:56.969> or<00:01:57.240> wild

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
were to make for a bow master or wild

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.749 
were to make for a bow master or wild
hunter<00:01:57.780> and<00:01:57.990> at<00:01:58.680> this<00:01:58.770> point<00:01:59.009> my<00:01:59.189> choice<00:01:59.640> was

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
hunter and at this point my choice was

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.639 
hunter and at this point my choice was
obvious<00:02:00.210> both<00:02:00.869> masters<00:02:01.200> didn't<00:02:01.469> really

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
obvious both masters didn't really

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:05.060 
obvious both masters didn't really
appeal<00:02:01.950> to<00:02:02.009> me<00:02:02.189> so<00:02:03.290> my<00:02:04.290> original<00:02:04.409> debate<00:02:04.890> was

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
appeal to me so my original debate was

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.130 
appeal to me so my original debate was
between<00:02:05.310> a<00:02:05.700> marksman<00:02:06.119> and<00:02:06.210> a<00:02:06.270> wild<00:02:06.570> hunter<00:02:06.899> and

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
between a marksman and a wild hunter and

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.749 
between a marksman and a wild hunter and
now<00:02:07.680> looked<00:02:07.950> like<00:02:08.099> I<00:02:08.190> was<00:02:08.220> making<00:02:08.520> the<00:02:08.580> right

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
now looked like I was making the right

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.580 
now looked like I was making the right
choice<00:02:08.970> because<00:02:09.360> as<00:02:09.840> usually<00:02:10.170> got<00:02:10.319> to<00:02:10.440> level

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
choice because as usually got to level

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:11.300 
choice because as usually got to level
10

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
10

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.830 
10
I instantly<00:02:11.730> fell<00:02:12.090> in<00:02:12.120> love<00:02:12.330> with<00:02:12.450> my<00:02:12.540> Wild

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
I instantly fell in love with my Wild

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.100 
I instantly fell in love with my Wild
Hunter<00:02:13.140> it<00:02:14.099> was<00:02:14.400> very<00:02:14.430> unique<00:02:15.390> in<00:02:15.599> terms<00:02:15.660> of

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
an hour before doggers got counted so I

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.140 
an hour before doggers got counted so I
tried<00:03:22.410> again<00:03:22.890> and<00:03:23.190> I<00:03:23.250> ended<00:03:23.609> up<00:03:23.700> beating<00:03:23.940> my

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
tried again and I ended up beating my

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.330 
tried again and I ended up beating my
time<00:03:24.180> and<00:03:24.600> got<00:03:24.750> 10<00:03:25.019> minutes<00:03:25.140> and<00:03:25.380> 49<00:03:25.680> seconds

time and got 10 minutes and 49 seconds

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.069
