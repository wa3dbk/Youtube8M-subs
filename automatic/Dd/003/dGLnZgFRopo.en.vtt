00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:21.269 
that they showed off a comic con which

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:23.420 
that they showed off a comic con which
is<00:03:21.390> fantastic<00:03:21.630> and<00:03:22.350> everybody's<00:03:23.100> going<00:03:23.250> home

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
is fantastic and everybody's going home

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:25.729 
is fantastic and everybody's going home
ant-man<00:03:23.850> can<00:03:24.360> work<00:03:24.569> look<00:03:24.840> at<00:03:24.959> that<00:03:25.110> because

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739 
ant-man can work look at that because

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:27.080 
ant-man can work look at that because
the<00:03:25.830> test<00:03:26.040> footage<00:03:26.220> was<00:03:26.459> great<00:03:26.819> if<00:03:27.000> you

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
the test footage was great if you

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:28.400 
the test footage was great if you
haven't<00:03:27.299> seen<00:03:27.450> it<00:03:27.510> maybe<00:03:27.720> I'll<00:03:27.930> find<00:03:28.170> and<00:03:28.319> put

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
haven't seen it maybe I'll find and put

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:30.170 
haven't seen it maybe I'll find and put
it<00:03:28.530> down<00:03:28.650> below<00:03:28.799> but<00:03:29.100> I<00:03:29.310> get<00:03:29.610> lazy<00:03:29.850> sometimes

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
it down below but I get lazy sometimes

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:31.400 
it down below but I get lazy sometimes
so<00:03:30.540> it's<00:03:30.660> probably<00:03:30.840> not<00:03:31.019> gonna<00:03:31.110> be<00:03:31.230> down<00:03:31.380> there

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
so it's probably not gonna be down there

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:33.319 
so it's probably not gonna be down there
and<00:03:31.769> my<00:03:31.890> guess<00:03:32.160> is<00:03:32.430> that<00:03:32.459> Edgar<00:03:32.970> Wright<00:03:33.150> was

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:33.329 
and my guess is that Edgar Wright was

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:35.449 
and my guess is that Edgar Wright was
just<00:03:33.510> going<00:03:33.750> to<00:03:33.780> bring<00:03:34.230> his<00:03:34.470> own<00:03:34.680> style<00:03:35.100> his

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:35.459 
just going to bring his own style his

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:37.160 
just going to bring his own style his
own<00:03:35.609> energy<00:03:36.180> because<00:03:36.450> he<00:03:36.570> has<00:03:36.690> so<00:03:36.870> much<00:03:36.989> energy

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
own energy because he has so much energy

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:39.110 
own energy because he has so much energy
he<00:03:37.739> knows<00:03:37.890> how<00:03:38.040> to<00:03:38.070> mix<00:03:38.340> practical<00:03:38.880> effects

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
he knows how to mix practical effects

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:40.759 
he knows how to mix practical effects
and<00:03:39.269> CG<00:03:39.840> effects<00:03:40.170> and<00:03:40.320> you<00:03:40.380> know<00:03:40.470> has<00:03:40.590> had<00:03:40.739> a
