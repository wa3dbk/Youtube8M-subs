00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
don't give a damn basically my theory is

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.250 
don't give a damn basically my theory is
that<00:00:37.649> banks<00:00:38.129> learned<00:00:39.030> last<00:00:39.360> year<00:00:39.510> was<00:00:39.840> it<00:00:39.989> was

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
that banks learned last year was it was

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.229 
that banks learned last year was it was
going<00:00:40.469> to<00:00:40.620> happen<00:00:40.920> they<00:00:41.550> bought<00:00:42.030> themselves

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
going to happen they bought themselves

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.440 
going to happen they bought themselves
over<00:00:43.079> a<00:00:43.110> nice<00:00:43.500> stock<00:00:43.890> of<00:00:44.070> gold<00:00:44.370> and<00:00:44.550> silver<00:00:44.910> is

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
over a nice stock of gold and silver is

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.569 
over a nice stock of gold and silver is
tested<00:00:45.930> away<00:00:46.170> and<00:00:46.469> now<00:00:46.950> they<00:00:47.100> are<00:00:47.129> looting<00:00:47.489> the

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
tested away and now they are looting the

that<00:03:50.650> this<00:03:50.769> guy<00:03:50.980> is<00:03:51.010> it<00:03:51.459> moaning<00:03:51.819> about<00:03:51.940> the

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150 
that this guy is it moaning about the

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:53.849 
that this guy is it moaning about the

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:53.859 
fact that he's losing 500 million a year

00:03:53.859 --> 00:03:56.190 
fact that he's losing 500 million a year
which<00:03:54.760> is<00:03:54.910> basically<00:03:55.239> a<00:03:55.359> good<00:03:55.720> thing<00:03:55.989> because

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:56.200 
which is basically a good thing because

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:00.330 
which is basically a good thing because
it<00:03:56.739> is<00:03:57.340> about<00:03:57.730> unfair<00:03:58.389> raising<00:03:58.840> of<00:03:59.019> rates<00:03:59.350> that

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:00.340 
it is about unfair raising of rates that

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:02.340 
it is about unfair raising of rates that
this<00:04:00.549> money<00:04:00.790> goes<00:04:01.000> into<00:04:01.209> and<00:04:01.480> I<00:04:01.569> calculated<00:04:02.170> at

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:02.350 
this money goes into and I calculated at

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:04.170 
this money goes into and I calculated at
once<00:04:02.560> it<00:04:02.739> runs<00:04:03.280> into<00:04:03.489> the<00:04:03.670> billions<00:04:03.910> of

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:04.180 
once it runs into the billions of

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:07.289 
once it runs into the billions of
dollars<00:04:04.569> that<00:04:05.170> banks<00:04:05.620> earn<00:04:06.010> because<00:04:07.000> they

00:04:07.289 --> 00:04:07.299 
dollars that banks earn because they

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:10.349 
dollars that banks earn because they
have<00:04:07.500> let's<00:04:08.500> say<00:04:08.650> owners<00:04:09.489> of<00:04:09.609> credit<00:04:09.910> cards<00:04:10.209> in

00:04:12.059 --> 00:04:12.069 
debt and they can raise the rates by a

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:14.280 
debt and they can raise the rates by a
few<00:04:12.310> percent<00:04:12.700> that<00:04:13.120> immediately<00:04:13.750> translates

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:14.290 
few percent that immediately translates

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:16.469 
few percent that immediately translates
into<00:04:14.470> billions<00:04:14.769> of<00:04:14.920> dollars<00:04:15.280> here<00:04:16.150> the<00:04:16.269> bank

00:04:16.469 --> 00:04:16.479 
into billions of dollars here the bank

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:18.870 
into billions of dollars here the bank
say<00:04:16.750> that<00:04:17.410> they<00:04:17.530> plan<00:04:17.769> to<00:04:17.889> raise<00:04:18.100> credit<00:04:18.549> cards

so how dysfunctional can a government be

00:04:37.319 --> 00:04:41.119 
so how dysfunctional can a government be
if<00:04:37.650> this<00:04:38.340> is<00:04:38.490> the<00:04:38.520> case<00:04:39.379> because<00:04:40.379> where's<00:04:40.949> the
