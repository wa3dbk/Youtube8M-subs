00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:07.450 

okay<00:00:06.140> so<00:00:06.200> I<00:00:06.380> thought<00:00:06.590> you<00:00:06.710> might<00:00:06.740> like<00:00:06.920> to<00:00:07.100> take

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:07.460 
okay so I thought you might like to take

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:10.330 
okay so I thought you might like to take
a<00:00:07.520> look<00:00:07.700> at<00:00:07.819> this<00:00:07.970> this<00:00:08.240> is<00:00:08.300> my<00:00:08.980> new<00:00:09.980> lens

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:10.340 
a look at this this is my new lens

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:15.609 
a look at this this is my new lens
controller<00:00:10.940> and<00:00:12.010> you<00:00:13.010> can<00:00:13.190> see<00:00:13.400> we<00:00:13.580> have<00:00:14.619> zoom

00:00:15.609 --> 00:00:15.619 
controller and you can see we have zoom

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:21.600 
controller and you can see we have zoom
control

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:21.610 

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:28.429 

and<00:00:22.510> we<00:00:22.630> can<00:00:22.780> do<00:00:22.930> nice<00:00:23.140> slow<00:00:23.470> creeping<00:00:24.310> zooms

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.740 

as<00:00:29.439> well<00:00:29.590> as<00:00:29.740> fast<00:00:29.980> uns

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.450 

variable<00:00:34.750> speed<00:00:34.960> zoom<00:00:35.260> then<00:00:36.100> this<00:00:36.309> little

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:36.460 
variable speed zoom then this little

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.299 
variable speed zoom then this little
wheel<00:00:36.700> here<00:00:37.180> controls<00:00:37.690> my<00:00:37.960> aperture<00:00:38.260> this<00:00:39.160> is

00:00:39.299 --> 00:00:39.309 
wheel here controls my aperture this is

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:42.270 
wheel here controls my aperture this is
a<00:00:39.340> canon<00:00:39.790> lens<00:00:40.199> and<00:00:41.199> this<00:00:41.440> gives<00:00:41.680> me<00:00:41.739> aperture

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:42.280 
a canon lens and this gives me aperture

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.660 
a canon lens and this gives me aperture
control<00:00:42.670> here<00:00:42.970> in<00:00:43.210> eighth<00:00:44.110> of<00:00:44.410> a<00:00:44.470> stop<00:00:44.739> step<00:00:45.370> so

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:45.670 
control here in eighth of a stop step so

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:47.640 
control here in eighth of a stop step so
I<00:00:45.699> can<00:00:45.940> zoom<00:00:45.970> with<00:00:46.360> this<00:00:46.540> these<00:00:47.170> fingers

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:47.650 
I can zoom with this these fingers

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:49.740 
I can zoom with this these fingers
control<00:00:48.550> my<00:00:48.760> exposure<00:00:49.150> here

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:49.750 
control my exposure here

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:54.240 
control my exposure here
with<00:00:49.930> my<00:00:50.080> thumb<00:00:50.379> and<00:00:50.850> if<00:00:51.850> we<00:00:52.059> just<00:00:53.100> flip<00:00:54.100> up

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:54.250 
with my thumb and if we just flip up

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:58.829 
with my thumb and if we just flip up
here<00:00:54.900> you<00:00:55.900> can<00:00:56.049> see<00:00:56.909> the<00:00:57.909> aperture<00:00:58.360> control

00:00:58.829 --> 00:00:58.839 
here you can see the aperture control

00:00:58.839 --> 00:01:01.170 
here you can see the aperture control
working<00:00:59.080> and<00:00:59.589> then<00:01:00.400> when<00:01:00.549> we<00:01:00.670> come<00:01:00.850> around<00:01:01.000> to

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:01.180 
working and then when we come around to

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:03.360 
working and then when we come around to
this<00:01:01.449> side<00:01:01.510> of<00:01:01.839> the<00:01:01.930> camera<00:01:02.140> here<00:01:02.650> we<00:01:02.799> have

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:03.370 
this side of the camera here we have

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:06.210 
this side of the camera here we have
another<00:01:03.519> control<00:01:04.000> here<00:01:04.449> so<00:01:05.199> I<00:01:05.229> can<00:01:05.500> hold<00:01:06.100> the

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:06.220 
another control here so I can hold the

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.300 
another control here so I can hold the
camera<00:01:06.400> down<00:01:07.270> here<00:01:07.330> this<00:01:07.780> hand<00:01:08.049> grip<00:01:08.290> and<00:01:08.500> I

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:09.310 
camera down here this hand grip and I

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:13.580 
camera down here this hand grip and I
can<00:01:09.909> adjust<00:01:10.380> the<00:01:11.380> the<00:01:12.190> focus<00:01:12.640> of<00:01:12.790> the<00:01:12.880> lens

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
can adjust the the focus of the lens

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.850 
can adjust the the focus of the lens
using<00:01:14.590> this<00:01:14.710> controller<00:01:15.369> here<00:01:16.560> so<00:01:17.560> there<00:01:17.740> you

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:17.860 
using this controller here so there you

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:24.980 
using this controller here so there you
have<00:01:17.920> it<00:01:18.420> we<00:01:19.420> have<00:01:19.720> remote<00:01:20.500> focus<00:01:21.100> and<00:01:22.020> we<00:01:23.020> have

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
have it we have remote focus and we have

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:30.140 
have it we have remote focus and we have
aperture<00:01:25.990> control<00:01:27.240> by<00:01:28.240> the<00:01:29.020> thumb<00:01:29.290> wheel<00:01:29.500> here

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
aperture control by the thumb wheel here

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:36.650 
aperture control by the thumb wheel here
plus<00:01:31.150> the<00:01:31.390> ability<00:01:31.480> to<00:01:33.570> zoom<00:01:34.570> in<00:01:34.810> and<00:01:35.170> zoom<00:01:35.280> out

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:36.660 
plus the ability to zoom in and zoom out

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:41.180 
plus the ability to zoom in and zoom out
this<00:01:37.660> is<00:01:37.870> very<00:01:38.500> much<00:01:38.650> a<00:01:38.710> prototype<00:01:39.400> it's<00:01:40.360> not

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:41.190 
this is very much a prototype it's not

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:44.100 
this is very much a prototype it's not
not<00:01:42.190> perfect<00:01:42.670> is<00:01:42.760> proof<00:01:42.970> of<00:01:43.060> concept<00:01:43.600> but<00:01:43.990> it

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:44.110 
not perfect is proof of concept but it

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:48.510 
not perfect is proof of concept but it
is<00:01:44.610> fully<00:01:45.610> functioning<00:01:46.210> or<00:01:46.600> works<00:01:47.160> as<00:01:48.160> you

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:48.520 
is fully functioning or works as you

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.149 
is fully functioning or works as you
would<00:01:48.730> hope<00:01:49.290> anything<00:01:50.290> is<00:01:50.409> the<00:01:50.620> zoom<00:01:50.860> motors<00:01:51.130> a

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:51.159 
would hope anything is the zoom motors a

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:53.730 
would hope anything is the zoom motors a
little<00:01:51.400> bit<00:01:51.490> noisy<00:01:51.690> but<00:01:52.690> I<00:01:53.050> think<00:01:53.440> this<00:01:53.500> is<00:01:53.650> an

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:53.740 
little bit noisy but I think this is an

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:58.200 
little bit noisy but I think this is an
interesting<00:01:54.010> project<00:01:54.430> and<00:01:54.909> I<00:01:55.570> hope<00:01:56.409> to<00:01:57.060> to<00:01:58.060> get

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.210 
interesting project and I hope to to get

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:01.920 
interesting project and I hope to to get
this<00:01:58.390> onto<00:01:59.020> the<00:01:59.110> market<00:01:59.470> very<00:01:59.590> soon
