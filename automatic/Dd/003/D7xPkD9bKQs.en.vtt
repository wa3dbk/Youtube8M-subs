00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:43.600 
insane so I'm meeting went to Moscow

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:51.390 
insane so I'm meeting went to Moscow

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:51.400 
where are you from Moscow I was on a

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:55.199 
where are you from Moscow I was on a
Russian<00:03:51.790> but<00:03:51.880> it's<00:03:52.000> just<00:03:52.209> all<00:03:52.300> right<00:03:52.810> now<00:03:53.880> so<00:03:54.880> I

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:57.190 
went there we have to go through to get

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:58.740 
went there we have to go through to get
into<00:03:57.430> the<00:03:57.520> space<00:03:58.000> program<00:03:58.209> which<00:03:58.630> is

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:58.750 
into the space program which is

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:00.570 
into the space program which is
completely<00:03:59.110> different<00:03:59.410> from<00:03:59.620> our<00:04:00.010> NASA<00:04:00.280> here

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:00.580 
completely different from our NASA here

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:03.240 
completely different from our NASA here
which<00:04:01.120> I<00:04:01.239> didn't<00:04:01.480> know<00:04:01.570> at<00:04:01.840> all<00:04:02.040> you<00:04:03.040> have<00:04:03.160> to

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:03.250 
which I didn't know at all you have to

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:07.670 
which I didn't know at all you have to
go<00:04:03.370> through<00:04:03.550> this<00:04:03.580> very<00:04:04.120> very<00:04:05.430> hard<00:04:06.430> physical

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
go through this very very hard physical

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.830 
go through this very very hard physical
examination<00:04:08.680> also<00:04:09.370> it's<00:04:09.850> like<00:04:10.030> four<00:04:10.270> days<00:04:10.510> and

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:10.840 
examination also it's like four days and

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:13.290 
examination also it's like four days and
they<00:04:11.110> study<00:04:11.500> every<00:04:12.070> nook<00:04:12.520> and<00:04:12.670> cranny<00:04:12.820> of<00:04:13.120> your

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:13.300 
they study every nook and cranny of your

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:18.680 
they study every nook and cranny of your
body<00:04:13.480> and<00:04:14.730> no<00:04:15.730> not<00:04:15.970> free

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:20.600 

so<00:04:19.320> the<00:04:19.440> first<00:04:19.560> time<00:04:19.830> and<00:04:20.220> I<00:04:20.280> had<00:04:20.430> to<00:04:20.519> go

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:20.610 
so the first time and I had to go

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:23.270 
so the first time and I had to go
through<00:04:20.940> everything<00:04:21.570> centrifuge<00:04:22.530> and<00:04:22.860> just

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 
through everything centrifuge and just

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.640 
through everything centrifuge and just
they<00:04:24.000> they<00:04:24.240> just<00:04:24.420> test<00:04:24.690> you<00:04:24.870> so<00:04:25.110> much<00:04:25.320> what

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.650 
they they just test you so much what

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:27.860 
they they just test you so much what
your<00:04:25.770> body<00:04:25.980> can<00:04:26.100> physically<00:04:26.640> withstand<00:04:27.000> then

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:27.870 
your body can physically withstand then

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:29.360 
your body can physically withstand then
they<00:04:27.960> found<00:04:28.170> a<00:04:28.290> problem<00:04:28.560> with<00:04:28.770> my<00:04:28.890> heart<00:04:29.130> which

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:29.370 
they found a problem with my heart which

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:31.220 
they found a problem with my heart which
was<00:04:29.610> completely<00:04:30.060> benign<00:04:30.420> about<00:04:30.690> an<00:04:30.840> irregular

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:31.230 
was completely benign about an irregular

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:34.280 
was completely benign about an irregular
heartbeat<00:04:31.260> and<00:04:32.150> who<00:04:33.150> knew<00:04:33.360> that<00:04:33.600> cosmonauts

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:34.290 
heartbeat and who knew that cosmonauts

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:35.750 
heartbeat and who knew that cosmonauts
can't<00:04:34.590> have<00:04:34.860> irregular<00:04:35.250> heartbeat<00:04:35.610> some

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:35.760 
can't have irregular heartbeat some

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:38.240 
can't have irregular heartbeat some
space<00:04:35.970> so<00:04:36.690> I<00:04:36.720> went<00:04:37.080> to<00:04:37.170> Boston<00:04:37.650> had<00:04:37.830> that<00:04:37.980> fixed

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:38.250 
space so I went to Boston had that fixed

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:41.240 
space so I went to Boston had that fixed
at<00:04:38.520> this<00:04:38.960> ablation<00:04:39.960> surgery<00:04:40.140> where<00:04:40.650> they<00:04:40.770> it's

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:41.250 
at this ablation surgery where they it's

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:42.740 
at this ablation surgery where they it's
kind<00:04:41.430> of<00:04:41.520> gross<00:04:41.730> that<00:04:42.390> I'm<00:04:42.480> going<00:04:42.570> to<00:04:42.630> share

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:42.750 
kind of gross that I'm going to share

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:46.100 
kind of gross that I'm going to share
anyway<00:04:43.640> where<00:04:44.640> they<00:04:44.730> take<00:04:44.910> these<00:04:45.120> like<00:04:45.330> metal

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:46.110 
anyway where they take these like metal

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:48.770 
anyway where they take these like metal
rods<00:04:46.380> and<00:04:46.740> they<00:04:47.310> put<00:04:47.520> them<00:04:47.610> up<00:04:47.730> your<00:04:47.940> arteries

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:48.780 
rods and they put them up your arteries

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:51.200 
rods and they put them up your arteries
join<00:04:49.590> and<00:04:49.860> they<00:04:49.920> go<00:04:50.070> and<00:04:50.160> study<00:04:50.370> apart<00:04:50.760> and

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:51.210 
join and they go and study apart and

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:52.400 
join and they go and study apart and
they<00:04:51.300> have<00:04:51.390> to<00:04:51.480> burn<00:04:51.690> places<00:04:52.200> whereas

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:52.410 
they have to burn places whereas

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:55.880 
they have to burn places whereas
misfiring<00:04:52.830> did<00:04:53.820> not<00:04:53.970> feel<00:04:54.180> good<00:04:54.360> at<00:04:54.630> all<00:04:54.810> and<00:04:55.800> I

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:55.890 
misfiring did not feel good at all and I

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:58.700 
misfiring did not feel good at all and I
got<00:04:56.070> better<00:04:56.220> be<00:04:56.400> going<00:04:56.580> to<00:04:56.640> space<00:04:56.850> so<00:04:57.660> did<00:04:58.500> that

00:04:58.700 --> 00:04:58.710 
got better be going to space so did that

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:02.450 
got better be going to space so did that
wetback<00:04:58.920> I<00:04:59.490> got<00:04:59.940> approved<00:05:00.360> Oh<00:05:01.320> another<00:05:02.220> really

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:02.460 
wetback I got approved Oh another really

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:04.970 
wetback I got approved Oh another really
funny<00:05:02.580> story
