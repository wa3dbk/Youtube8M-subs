here comes all the Zora infantry not
much<00:03:03.380> left<00:03:03.740> but<00:03:04.360> I'd<00:03:05.360> say<00:03:05.750> they<00:03:05.960> have<00:03:06.350> at<00:03:06.590> least

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:06.710 
much left but I'd say they have at least

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:08.680 
much left but I'd say they have at least
the<00:03:06.950> same<00:03:07.190> amount<00:03:07.580> of<00:03:07.670> troops<00:03:08.000> that<00:03:08.270> I<00:03:08.300> have

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:08.690 
the same amount of troops that I have

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:12.400 
the same amount of troops that I have
and<00:03:09.520> since<00:03:10.520> the<00:03:10.700> Zora<00:03:10.940> are<00:03:11.180> no<00:03:11.900> physically

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:12.410 
and since the Zora are no physically

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:15.310 
and since the Zora are no physically
stronger<00:03:12.770> than<00:03:13.130> the<00:03:13.250> Koch<00:03:13.460> period<00:03:14.050> don't<00:03:15.050> know

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:15.320 
stronger than the Koch period don't know

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:18.790 
stronger than the Koch period don't know
that's<00:03:15.980> to<00:03:16.310> my<00:03:16.550> advantage<00:03:17.500> looks<00:03:18.500> like<00:03:18.680> they

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:18.800 
that's to my advantage looks like they

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:23.800 
that's to my advantage looks like they
outnumber<00:03:19.280> me<00:03:19.460> actually<00:03:22.330> not<00:03:23.330> sure<00:03:23.570> how<00:03:23.720> I'm

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 
outnumber me actually not sure how I'm

archers actually have knives that they
use<00:06:38.180> so<00:06:39.009> if<00:06:40.009> I<00:06:40.099> were<00:06:40.250> to<00:06:40.280> charge<00:06:40.610> them<00:06:40.939> I<00:06:41.030> might

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:41.240 
use so if I were to charge them I might

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:46.029 
use so if I were to charge them I might
actually<00:06:42.159> win<00:06:43.629> unless<00:06:44.629> they<00:06:44.870> run<00:06:45.080> away<00:06:45.229> which

00:06:46.029 --> 00:06:46.039 
actually win unless they run away which

00:06:46.039 --> 00:06:49.689 
actually win unless they run away which
it<00:06:46.189> looks<00:06:46.280> like<00:06:46.430> they're<00:06:47.060> doing<00:06:48.340> up<00:06:49.340> there<00:06:49.550> all

00:06:49.689 --> 00:06:49.699 
it looks like they're doing up there all

00:06:49.699 --> 00:06:51.219 
it looks like they're doing up there all
running<00:06:50.030> away<00:06:50.270> they're<00:06:50.629> going<00:06:50.930> in<00:06:51.020> full

00:06:51.219 --> 00:06:51.229 
running away they're going in full

00:06:51.229 --> 00:06:57.159 
running away they're going in full
retreat<00:06:51.409> which<00:06:52.069> means<00:06:52.340> I<00:06:52.460> might<00:06:52.639> win<00:06:54.460> yep<00:06:56.169> loss

00:06:57.159 --> 00:06:57.169 
retreat which means I might win yep loss

00:06:57.169 --> 00:06:59.140 
retreat which means I might win yep loss

00:07:10.649 --> 00:07:10.659 
as I mentioned earlier just constantly

00:07:10.659 --> 00:07:12.790

what's the words I'm looking forward is

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:14.350 
what's the words I'm looking forward is
back<00:07:13.129> and<00:07:13.370> forth<00:07:13.580> between<00:07:13.789> who<00:07:14.060> had<00:07:14.240> the

00:07:15.969 --> 00:07:15.979 
advantage so that was actually really

00:07:15.979 --> 00:07:23.140 
advantage so that was actually really
fun<00:07:16.189> fight<00:07:20.169> so<00:07:21.169> that's<00:07:21.710> about<00:07:21.889> it<00:07:22.039> for<00:07:22.430> the<00:07:22.849> co

00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:23.150

00:07:27.219 --> 00:07:27.229 
kerry next up i will start working on

00:07:27.229 --> 00:07:30.579 
kerry next up i will start working on
the<00:07:27.409> Goma<00:07:27.889> and<00:07:28.810> since<00:07:29.810> they<00:07:30.050> are<00:07:30.110> a<00:07:30.289> non

00:07:30.579 --> 00:07:30.589 
the Goma and since they are a non

00:07:30.589 --> 00:07:32.290 
the Goma and since they are a non
humanoid<00:07:31.159> race<00:07:31.400> that's<00:07:31.639> probably<00:07:32.060> actually

00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:32.300 
humanoid race that's probably actually

00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:35.260 
humanoid race that's probably actually
going<00:07:32.750> to<00:07:32.900> take<00:07:33.349> me<00:07:33.529> a<00:07:33.560> long<00:07:34.370> while<00:07:34.430> to<00:07:34.669> finish

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:35.270 
going to take me a long while to finish

00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:36.490 
going to take me a long while to finish
