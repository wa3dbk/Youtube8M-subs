so hopefully next time it won't end like

00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:33.710 
so hopefully next time it won't end like
this<00:07:32.100> and<00:07:32.280> I'm<00:07:32.340> confused<00:07:32.700> as<00:07:32.940> hell<00:07:33.120> what's

00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:33.720

this and I'm confused as hell what's
going<00:07:33.990> on<00:07:34.140> but<00:07:34.500> that<00:07:35.070> will<00:07:35.220> probably<00:07:35.520> happen

00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:35.580 
going on but that will probably happen

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:37.460 
going on but that will probably happen
anyway<00:07:36.060> that's<00:07:36.300> reason<00:07:36.510> why<00:07:36.570> no<00:07:36.630> tutorials

00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:37.470 
anyway that's reason why no tutorials

00:07:37.470 --> 00:07:39.410 
anyway that's reason why no tutorials
but<00:07:37.740> hope<00:07:38.220> you<00:07:38.310> guys<00:07:38.430> enjoy<00:07:38.700> see<00:07:39.210> you<00:07:39.270> guys
