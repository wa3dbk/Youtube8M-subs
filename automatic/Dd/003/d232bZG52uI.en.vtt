00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:17.690 
like was way too fast like events would
be<00:01:16.680> happening<00:01:16.860> and<00:01:17.250> then<00:01:17.369> there<00:01:17.520> wouldn't

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
be happening and then there wouldn't

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.520 
be happening and then there wouldn't
make<00:01:17.850> sense<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:18.420> way<00:01:18.540> they<00:01:18.750> were<00:01:19.320> put

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530

kind<00:01:43.829> of<00:01:43.920> characters<00:01:44.250> that<00:01:44.280> you<00:01:44.399> don't<00:01:44.579> really

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
kind of characters that you don't really

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.280

00:03:59.600 --> 00:03:59.610 
I could tell while reading it that it

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:01.490 
I could tell while reading it that it
was<00:03:59.790> just<00:04:00.090> a<00:04:00.330> novelization<00:04:00.689> of<00:04:01.019> a<00:04:01.110> movie<00:04:01.379> and

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
was just a novelization of a movie and

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.160 
was just a novelization of a movie and
that's<00:04:01.650> not<00:04:02.400> a<00:04:02.700> great<00:04:02.909> thing<00:04:03.299> to<00:04:03.569> experience

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:12.420 
read this book I was just just watching
the<00:04:11.200> movie<00:04:11.440> instead<00:04:11.650> because<00:04:12.100> it<00:04:12.310> works

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:12.430 
the movie instead because it works

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:13.980 
the movie instead because it works
better<00:04:12.670> as<00:04:12.910> a<00:04:12.940> movie<00:04:13.240> than<00:04:13.390> it<00:04:13.480> does<00:04:13.600> as<00:04:13.720> a<00:04:13.780> book

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:13.990 
better as a movie than it does as a book

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:15.990 
better as a movie than it does as a book
and<00:04:14.140> so<00:04:14.560> I<00:04:14.590> gave<00:04:14.920> this<00:04:15.069> book<00:04:15.250> three<00:04:15.730> and<00:04:15.940> a<00:04:15.970> half

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:16.000 
and so I gave this book three and a half

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.120 
and so I gave this book three and a half
out<00:04:16.450> of<00:04:16.510> five<00:04:16.570> stars<00:04:16.690> i<00:04:16.959> think<00:04:17.140> and<00:04:17.320> i<00:04:17.980> would

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:18.130 
out of five stars i think and i would

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:21.120 
out of five stars i think and i would
have<00:04:18.220> given<00:04:18.340> the<00:04:18.549> movie<00:04:18.790> like<00:04:18.970> 04<00:04:19.859> so<00:04:20.859> the

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:21.130 
have given the movie like 04 so the

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:22.950 
have given the movie like 04 so the
movie<00:04:21.370> was<00:04:21.400> a<00:04:21.519> bit<00:04:21.730> better<00:04:21.940> and<00:04:22.210> last<00:04:22.810> but

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960 
movie was a bit better and last but

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:24.840 
movie was a bit better and last but
certainly<00:04:23.080> not<00:04:23.380> least<00:04:23.530> i<00:04:23.860> reread<00:04:24.310> I'm<00:04:24.550> the
