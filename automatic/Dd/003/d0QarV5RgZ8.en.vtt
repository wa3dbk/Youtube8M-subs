00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.559
 it was a match that barium did not 

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:09.700
 not the right to lose the least that one 

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:10.930
 can say is that men of 

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:12.670
 david lessard did the right thing 

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:14.289
 so that this scenario does not even happen 

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:15.820
 part of the possibilities saturday after 

00:00:14.289 --> 00:00:17.890
 noon at the stadium place of the university 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:20.230
 concordia in the end a victory without 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:21.940
 40 8 6 call in a match punctuated by 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:23.140
 several turnarounds as it's 

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:24.730
 often the case since the beginning of the 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:26.890
 quarter season jÃ©rÃ©mi roch experienced a 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:28.360
 strong full match time 22 assists in 31 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:30.789
 attempts including two for touchdowns 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:32.649
 all for gains of 230 yards 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:34.270
 this time however it is the unit 

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:36.280
 defensive that made the difference with 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:38.110
 it's this turnaround provoked 14 points 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:39.850
 marked secondary Nicolas Boulay a 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:43.510
 continued his good job picking him up 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:45.130
 and 9.5 lakes and the many supporters of the 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:46.600
 green &amp; gold nothing concordia believed relive 

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:47.890
 the nightmare of last week 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.030
 so what dyer leave marked 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:50.800
 from their first possession 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:52.149
 it's the engine that whack thriller 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.079
 which allowed his people to register for 

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:54.579
 the mark with less than two minutes 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:56.530
 of elbows on the board he who succeeded 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:57.790
 a 20-yard placement 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:59.079
 unlike the match against red and 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:01.059
 gold men david lessard have 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:02.500
 immediately replicated vincent cleroux 

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:04.750
 catching a nine-yard pass 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.100
 jyles remy role in the pay zone soon 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:07.389
 the next sequence while the 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.340
 tawny menaced the defensive back 

00:01:07.389 --> 00:01:11.049
 simon rivard intercepted a pass that 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.969
 was meant to jesse may cry to have him from 

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:16.359
 galloping for 82 yards into the 

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:18.100
 goal zone before the end of the first 

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:20.170
 cars were 17 three variants william 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:21.399
 dion and succeeding 72nd placement 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:23.529
 career with just over two 

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:24.909
 minutes to make them at the same time become 

00:01:23.529 --> 00:01:26.799
 the record holder of interuniversity sport 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:28.990
 Canadian Pole 

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:30.130
 precision just as hectic the 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:32.380
 second quarter allowed Sherbrooke residents 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:33.609
 to increase their lead to 28 6 in particular 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.679
 thanks to the second placement of william 

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:37.630
 dion and touch of Francis Lapointe 

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:38.319
 who caught a 24-yard pass in 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:40.569
 promised land 

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:42.159
 the second half was murdered that 

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:43.869
 varied adds 20 points his lead 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:45.399
 blessed djock first marked the 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:46.779
 first major changes what on the ground this 

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:47.259
 season after a nice push in area 

00:01:46.779 --> 00:01:48.969
 enemy 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:50.919
 he only had to run on two yards 

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:52.929
 to cross the mowing beginning william 

00:01:50.919 --> 00:01:54.579
 dion with its 3rd and 4th placement of the 

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:56.020
 day and defensive lineman 

00:01:54.579 --> 00:01:57.849
 Frederic Verville who scored after 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.950
 have recovered an escaped balloon have 

00:01:57.849 --> 00:02:01.239
 completed the fred mark of a point of 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:02.950
 france view is the theme this 

00:02:01.239 --> 00:02:05.139
 room week before a good start at 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.860
 gun departure was not exploded we put 

00:02:05.139 --> 00:02:07.300
 a lot 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.759
 many children are the first 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:10.360
 games the first sequence to french who 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:12.820
 it paid 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:15.520
 we made a touchdown I think gave 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:16.990
 the tone in common defense and what do you 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.010
 have a defense and a performance 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:21.730
 dominant 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:23.560
 it was really hard on defense and a 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:25.540
 game that defines us well note especially 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.440
 the defensive have a defensive that 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.150
 able to foil 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:31.270
 so that's what we've shown 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:33.010
 today the content and especially 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:38.650
 attacked the deep waves I think 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:40.240
 the respondent reacted today we have 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:42.820
 does our 12th as the cases I say everything 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:44.620
 the time me first are not enough 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:46.930
 I do not know 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:48.640
 this week it's the fruit of a 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:50.110
 work would see him back in 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.820
