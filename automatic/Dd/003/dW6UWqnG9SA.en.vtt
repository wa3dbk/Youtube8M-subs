00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:08.580
 good afternoon to the whole forum is the 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.269
 hobby again I'm jesus and well then 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.219
 nothing 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.349
 as promised it's debt I'm here 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:16.500
 to make a small video where 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:18.420
 explain how to look for the cables of a 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.359
 stepper motor to be able to connect 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.670
 to a controller is not that I am a 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.650
 genius of electronics but good this 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.599
 I've learned it and how I think it's good 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.760
 share then I say I say I have 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.710
 time let's do it 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.710
 good at first we met 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:37.320
 with the eternal gibberish of the engines 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.440
 step by step where we see that we have then 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:43.860
 a stream of cables in this case then 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:47.750
 are six wires then we say good and 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:49.800
 here this as how it goes so simple 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:52.530
 the first thing we should do 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:56.280
 would be to take one of the tester's tips 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:59.340
 and connect it to anyone at any 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.780
 any stepper motor cable yo 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.780
 for example I take the green 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:07.659
 Well let's see between green 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:10.690
 for example and the black we see that the 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:13.150
 tester does not answer does not do anything to see 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:15.050
 between green and red for that of 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:16.950
 the colors 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:19.439
 well nothing 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.390
 well I see that I have another green for 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.579
 deduction I say will you see if they're going 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.920
 together for that of the colors because 

00:01:23.579 --> 00:01:29.429
 one is green and the other is green and white 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:33.030
 Well, to see good, it seems we have 

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:36.060
 good continuity according to the tester the 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:39.090
 tester is on the scale of two kilos the 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:42.299
 lower and we see that we have 13 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:44.789
 Ohms is worth between the two cables 13 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:46.740
 between the two green wires we have 13 

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:49.349
 ohm well let's see if there 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.720
 continuity with some more of those that 

00:01:49.349 --> 00:01:53.429
 we have left we have seen that with the black 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.549
 and the red there is no continuity we had left 

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:59.740
 another red I think it was this one with this 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:02.170
 nothing with the other red 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:04.430
 nothing with the black we have already seen that 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.640
 nothing she the white 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:08.590
 look with the white yes 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:11.110
 but fix 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:12.900
 between white and green we have 8 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:18.019
 Oh, God 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:18.019
 and between green and the other green 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:24.989
 we have 13 UFOs 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:28.109
 almost twice as much as we can interpret 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:32.310
 with this very simple that among the 

00:02:28.109 --> 00:02:35.489
 two green are the two coils that 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:38.700
 they make up a good part of the stepper motor 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:41.579
 step by step and by deduction we see that 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:44.459
 there are four coils and in two of them 

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:47.579
 are connected between the greens and the 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:51.359
 white and between the two green fingers 

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:55.489
 we have thirteen ohms and between any 

00:02:51.359 --> 00:02:55.489
 of the greens and the white 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:02.990
 we have almost half in this case 8 that 

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:06.950
 it means very simple that between 

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:09.800
 any green and white 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:11.620
 the common point of the two is established 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:14.290
 coils 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:18.340
 let's see we have already said that between 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:20.940
 green and white we are 8 years old and between 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:25.320
 green and green 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:30.490
 We have 13 almost 14, so let's see 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:33.930
 among the reds among the reds we have 

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:36.689
 red and red 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:39.000
 well look we also have 13 ohms the 

00:03:36.689 --> 00:03:41.990
 same values as between the other two 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:45.050
 green and between 

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:47.750
 the red and the black eight years exactly 

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:51.200
 same as in the other coils that we 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:55.460
 means this very simple that between 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:58.880
 red and red are the two ends of 

00:03:55.460 --> 00:04:02.000
 the two coils and the black wire would be 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:04.670
 the common then as in most 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:08.120
 stepper motor controllers no 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:12.920
 the common one is used in the terminals where 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:15.950
 put more to less to connect these 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:19.520
 two cables which would be the ends 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:22.389
 of the coils and the black isolate it and 

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:24.430
 masters and we would not use it 

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:27.999
 the other terminals of the controller 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:31.779
 that would be more and less go then 

00:04:27.999 --> 00:04:33.400
 we would connect the two green wires that 

00:04:31.779 --> 00:04:37.629
 we also see that it gives us the same value 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:41.319
 that the two red 13 gives us 13 ohms 

00:04:37.629 --> 00:04:44.569
 for the same in more sees and less sees 

00:04:41.319 --> 00:04:47.569
 we would connect these two cables 

00:04:44.569 --> 00:04:49.789
 a recommendation if you have an engine 

00:04:47.569 --> 00:04:52.099
 step by step like this that I have for 

00:04:49.789 --> 00:04:57.789
 example where you get a cable that is 

00:04:52.099 --> 00:05:01.909
 red and white and green and white that would be 

00:04:57.789 --> 00:05:05.779
 this if this one for example in more to 

00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:09.709
 put red and white and in more sees put 

00:05:05.779 --> 00:05:10.339
 green and white and what are the red in 

00:05:09.709 --> 00:05:13.099
 less 

00:05:10.339 --> 00:05:17.360
 and the green in less well or colors and 

00:05:13.099 --> 00:05:18.949
 mixtures in the same sign is therefore worth nothing 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:21.319
 only this you already see that in 

00:05:18.949 --> 00:05:22.969
 reality is not that difficult because nothing 

00:05:21.319 --> 00:05:25.399
 I hope someone takes advantage and can 

00:05:22.969 --> 00:05:28.029
 could have helped someone come 

00:05:25.399 --> 00:05:28.029
 many thanks
