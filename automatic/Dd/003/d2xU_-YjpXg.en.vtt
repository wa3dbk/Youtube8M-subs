00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:31.570 
looking for what kit we need for the job
were<00:00:30.680> generally<00:00:30.980> looking<00:00:31.010> at<00:00:31.279> the<00:00:31.369> kit<00:00:31.550> that

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:31.580 
were generally looking at the kit that

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:34.060 
were generally looking at the kit that
can<00:00:31.820> do<00:00:31.940> the<00:00:32.059> job<00:00:32.500> essentially<00:00:33.500> firstly

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:34.070 
can do the job essentially firstly

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:37.150 
can do the job essentially firstly
safely<00:00:34.580> and<00:00:35.480> the<00:00:35.570> most<00:00:35.750> efficient<00:00:36.230> where<00:00:36.379> and

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:37.160 
safely and the most efficient where and

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:38.680 
safely and the most efficient where and
obviously<00:00:37.610> bring<00:00:37.760> the<00:00:37.850> project<00:00:38.030> in<00:00:38.360> on<00:00:38.480> time

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:38.690 
obviously bring the project in on time

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:41.619 
obviously bring the project in on time
on<00:00:39.440> cost<00:00:39.830> we<00:00:40.790> tend<00:00:41.030> to<00:00:41.059> go<00:00:41.210> off<00:00:41.269> the<00:00:41.420> Trevor

00:00:41.619 --> 00:00:41.629 
on cost we tend to go off the Trevor
