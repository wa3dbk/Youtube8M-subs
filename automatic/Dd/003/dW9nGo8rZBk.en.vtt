did this part of childhood part of
school<00:02:01.460> and

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:02.240 
school and

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.210 
school and
I<00:02:02.329> think<00:02:02.960> we<00:02:03.079> would<00:02:03.229> deal<00:02:03.409> with<00:02:03.439> it<00:02:03.710> pretty

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:04.220 
I think we would deal with it pretty

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:08.350 
I think we would deal with it pretty
much<00:02:04.369> the<00:02:04.549> same<00:02:04.700> way<00:02:04.759> a<00:02:05.380> little<00:02:06.380> bit<00:02:07.179> and<00:02:08.179> then

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
much the same way a little bit and then

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:18.490 
much the same way a little bit and then
we'd<00:02:08.509> shaver<00:02:08.780> I<00:02:16.540> don't<00:02:17.540> have<00:02:17.690> to<00:02:17.870> worry<00:02:18.140> about

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
we'd shaver I don't have to worry about

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:25.780 
we'd shaver I don't have to worry about
it<00:02:20.739> baby<00:02:21.739> and<00:02:21.920> my<00:02:22.190> mom<00:02:22.400> a<00:02:22.430> story<00:02:23.090> about<00:02:23.269> I
