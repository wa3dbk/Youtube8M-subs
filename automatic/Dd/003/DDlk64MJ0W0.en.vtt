 a garden is not synonymous with plants 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.920
 piled up for that first of all 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.890

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.439
 that already exist in the garden for example 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.840
 if you have a tree trunk , do not 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:30.960

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.579

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.170
 be pruned in winter 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:50.469

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:57.140
