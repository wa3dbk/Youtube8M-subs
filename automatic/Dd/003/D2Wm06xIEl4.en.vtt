over the top of it with the red and
white<00:01:57.990> facepaint<00:01:58.409> and<00:01:58.860> this<00:01:59.310> seems<00:01:59.490> a<00:01:59.610> little

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
white facepaint and this seems a little

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.670 
white facepaint and this seems a little
bit<00:01:59.909> weird<00:01:59.939> but<00:02:00.509> it<00:02:00.630> makes<00:02:00.659> a<00:02:00.990> really<00:02:01.380> cool

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
bit weird but it makes a really cool

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.459 
bit weird but it makes a really cool
effect<00:02:01.890> for<00:02:02.520> a<00:02:02.549> faded<00:02:03.060> wave<00:02:03.329> in<00:02:03.630> our<00:02:03.780> flag<00:02:05.060> and

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:06.469 
effect for a faded wave in our flag and

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:08.900 
effect for a faded wave in our flag and
then<00:02:07.469> taking<00:02:07.829> that<00:02:07.860> black<00:02:08.190> eye<00:02:08.399> shadow<00:02:08.429> once

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
then taking that black eye shadow once

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.029 
then taking that black eye shadow once
again<00:02:09.209> and<00:02:09.420> applying<00:02:09.780> another<00:02:10.289> line<00:02:10.560> down<00:02:10.890> the

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
again and applying another line down the

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.100 
again and applying another line down the
other<00:02:11.220> side<00:02:11.400> of<00:02:11.760> the<00:02:11.879> bump<00:02:12.090> in<00:02:12.239> the<00:02:12.360> flag<00:02:12.599> but

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
other side of the bump in the flag but

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.850 
other side of the bump in the flag but
I'm<00:02:13.319> not

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
I'm not

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.530 
I'm not
actually<00:02:14.130> fading<00:02:14.490> this<00:02:14.610> one<00:02:14.850> out<00:02:15.060> I'm<00:02:15.270> going

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
actually fading this one out I'm going

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.540 
actually fading this one out I'm going
to<00:02:15.570> add<00:02:15.810> some<00:02:16.080> shading<00:02:16.440> next<00:02:16.980> to<00:02:17.070> it<00:02:17.190> which<00:02:17.400> is

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
to add some shading next to it which is

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.580 
to add some shading next to it which is
going<00:02:17.760> to<00:02:17.880> make<00:02:18.120> it<00:02:18.300> our<00:02:18.450> prominent<00:02:18.900> wave<00:02:19.260> in

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
going to make it our prominent wave in

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:26.540 
going to make it our prominent wave in
the<00:02:19.710> flag<00:02:23.840> I'm<00:02:24.840> then<00:02:25.740> taking<00:02:25.770> some<00:02:26.310> white

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
the flag I'm then taking some white

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.850 
the flag I'm then taking some white
facepaint<00:02:26.880> and<00:02:27.360> adding<00:02:27.690> in<00:02:27.870> some<00:02:27.900> stars<00:02:28.560> on

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
facepaint and adding in some stars on

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.850 
facepaint and adding in some stars on
top<00:02:28.920> of<00:02:29.520> the<00:02:29.820> blue<00:02:30.120> rectangle<00:02:30.840> if<00:02:31.080> you<00:02:31.680> have

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
top of the blue rectangle if you have

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.130 
top of the blue rectangle if you have
the<00:02:31.980> patience<00:02:32.460> by<00:02:32.670> all<00:02:32.970> means<00:02:33.300> go<00:02:33.570> ahead<00:02:33.900> and

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
the patience by all means go ahead and

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.950 
the patience by all means go ahead and
draw<00:02:34.350> 50<00:02:34.680> stars<00:02:35.220> but<00:02:36.000> I<00:02:36.060> just<00:02:36.390> applied<00:02:36.690> a<00:02:36.720> few

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:36.960 
draw 50 stars but I just applied a few

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.990 
draw 50 stars but I just applied a few
random<00:02:37.320> ones<00:02:37.530> here<00:02:37.830> and<00:02:37.950> there<00:02:38.160> this<00:02:38.550> is<00:02:38.760> also

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
random ones here and there this is also

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.970 
random ones here and there this is also
because<00:02:39.510> I'm<00:02:39.630> really<00:02:39.990> terrible<00:02:40.560> at<00:02:40.740> drawing

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
because I'm really terrible at drawing

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:46.640 
because I'm really terrible at drawing
stars<00:02:41.600> and<00:02:44.180> I<00:02:45.180> finished<00:02:45.630> the<00:02:45.930> look<00:02:46.110> off<00:02:46.350> by

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
stars and I finished the look off by

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.160 
stars and I finished the look off by
drawing<00:02:46.709> the<00:02:47.130> letters<00:02:47.490> USA<00:02:48.330> onto<00:02:48.959> my<00:02:49.110> forehead

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
drawing the letters USA onto my forehead

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.590 
drawing the letters USA onto my forehead
in<00:02:49.740> the<00:02:50.100> three<00:02:50.340> colors<00:02:50.730> that<00:02:50.970> were<00:02:51.060> used<00:02:51.360> on

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
in the three colors that were used on

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.690 
in the three colors that were used on
the<00:02:51.780> flag<00:02:51.989> now<00:02:52.650> I<00:02:52.680> was<00:02:52.950> bound<00:02:53.250> to<00:02:53.400> get

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
the flag now I was bound to get

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.990 
the flag now I was bound to get
something<00:02:54.270> backwards<00:02:54.510> of<00:02:54.930> course<00:02:55.170> and<00:02:55.850> it<00:02:56.850> was

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
something backwards of course and it was

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.090 
something backwards of course and it was
a<00:02:57.030> toss-up<00:02:57.630> between<00:02:57.840> having<00:02:58.350> the<00:02:58.470> USA

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
a toss-up between having the USA

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.310 
a toss-up between having the USA
backwards<00:02:59.610> or<00:02:59.790> the<00:02:59.910> flag<00:03:00.180> backwards<00:03:00.720> and<00:03:00.930> I

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:01.320 
backwards or the flag backwards and I

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.050 
backwards or the flag backwards and I
figured<00:03:01.650> it<00:03:01.739> was<00:03:01.860> better<00:03:02.100> to<00:03:02.220> have<00:03:02.459> the<00:03:02.580> USA

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
figured it was better to have the USA

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.810 
figured it was better to have the USA
facing<00:03:03.570> forwards<00:03:04.010> so<00:03:05.010> when<00:03:05.190> you<00:03:05.280> to<00:03:05.430> the<00:03:05.550> flag

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:05.820 
facing forwards so when you to the flag

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:07.400 
facing forwards so when you to the flag
make<00:03:06.060> sure<00:03:06.239> you<00:03:06.330> flip<00:03:06.570> it<00:03:06.660> around<00:03:06.780> and<00:03:07.140> have

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
make sure you flip it around and have

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:09.320 
make sure you flip it around and have
the<00:03:07.680> rectangle<00:03:08.310> on<00:03:08.459> the<00:03:08.580> other<00:03:08.730> side<00:03:09.120> of<00:03:09.239> your

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 
the rectangle on the other side of your

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:19.400 
the rectangle on the other side of your
face

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:22.140 

okay<00:03:20.410> and<00:03:20.620> there<00:03:20.770> we<00:03:20.800> have<00:03:20.950> our<00:03:21.069> completed<00:03:21.730> 4th
