00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:04.569
 hello friends that such good afternoon as 

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:06.220
 they are saving them for here again 

00:00:04.569 --> 00:00:08.410
 misfortune of victory and world autumnal 

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:11.200
 As you can see we already have sheets of 

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:13.360
 maple everywhere and since they 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:14.650
 I want to talk a little one 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:16.810
 question that I have been asked a lot 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:19.480
 they say hey when I find out my mustache 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:21.099
 my hair falls out or at least I 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.810
 I'm washing with shampoo does not make 

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:24.640
 I fall off crimes so they worry 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:27.249
 much to hear is that I'm staying 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.900
 no mustache that I am what I am 

00:00:27.249 --> 00:00:30.759
 I'm pulling a little bit of what 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:31.960
 is what I want to talk to you is that 

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:34.449
 there is no reason why 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:36.219
 worry about the hair usually has 

00:00:34.449 --> 00:00:38.199
 any hair the hair of the head the 

00:00:36.219 --> 00:00:39.969
 hair of the beard and mustache on the hair 

00:00:38.199 --> 00:00:42.570
 body has three phases of growth 

00:00:39.969 --> 00:00:45.730
 that they are the one phase that they call 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:48.940
 anagen and new Cartagena and then I'll 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:50.949
 henna in the anagen phase what happens 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:54.670
 is that the hair starts to grow and 

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:56.140
 is somehow linked to the 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:57.550
 blood stream is connected to 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:00.329
 torrent coming out of the torrent 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:02.969
 blood carries problems 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.470
 giving nutrients to the hair between 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.500
 begins to grow and that's what it 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.600
 called the anagen phase in the anagen phase 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.149
 depends on the type of hair the hair of 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.220
 hair of the head may be in the phase of 

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:16.530
 agenda for two years three years these 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.470
 seven years ten years and the people in 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.759
 which the hair is for ten years in 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.630
 phase in the agenda because they can grow 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.630
 hair to the knees 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:31.500
 then little by little the hair starts to 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:33.630
 cut that is the connection with the 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.220
 bloodstream that's a phrase that 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.130
 it's called kata g on the page 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.840
 destruction the connection with 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.430
 the blood and the hair stops 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.950
 grow hair stop growing 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:48.820
 the moment in which the beautiful or the 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:52.510
 hair goes from anaerobic phase to aspace 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:54.610
 Cartagena depends on genetics as 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:57.500
 you can see not extremely 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:02:02.420
 long mustache has 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:04.610
 I guess I think it's about 8 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:07.490
 approximately in the phase of 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:10.000
 growth in phase on ag then it happens to 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:12.790
 the Cartagena phase when it stops growing 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:16.270
 and then move on to a phase called 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:18.250
 telogen in this phase of lorraine the 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:19.319
 hair no longer has connection with the 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:21.180
 chest 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:23.980
 it does not grow anymore 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:27.010
 he is practically dead 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:29.440
 dead tissue the skin starts to 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:31.910
 expelling the hair starts to be 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:37.780
 expelled 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:37.780
 sometimes as you are coming out of the skin 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:52.890
 is important for any kind of 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:55.500
 hair eventually falls 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:57.030
 and what is interesting is that many 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.550
 sometimes we do not realize the hair of 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:01.020
 the head for example a normal adult 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:02.250
 a normal person does not necessarily 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:06.780
 adult a normal girl 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:10.180
 loses approximately 110 to 200 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:12.159
 hair by way 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:13.629
 what the search engines did when 

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:15.069
 usually we will not give notice because 

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:18.030
 it falls in the moment is that I do not know 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:20.520
 imagine us apart from me 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:22.330
 the bus or when they are walking 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:25.480
 because they are eating 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:28.090
 was finally 100 to 200 hairs 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:31.110
 daily is usually imagine 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:34.900
 the mustache hair is the same we lose 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:36.550
 between 10 to 15 or something brass is over 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:40.290
 they mustache every day so 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:42.790
 normal but after the telogen phase 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:44.620
 after the hair goes down it starts 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:46.120
 a new anagen phase and starts to 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:47.620
 grow a new wind that's why as 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.940
 all hair like all hairs 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:51.120
 they are in different points of 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:51.120
 increase 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:57.730
 well, it does not seem that we are 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:59.170
 we are getting bald then 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:00.700
 this is nothing more to assure 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:02.200
 all who care what they tell me 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:03.939
 Hey, I'm not removing my hair 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:06.280
 a little bit and that I'm going to stay bald 

00:04:03.939 --> 00:04:09.400
 of the mustache so do not worry about that 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:10.870
 it does not happen does not fall hair in a way 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:12.400
 normal sometimes when they are 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:15.010
 finding out they pull a little with a 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:18.100
 little bit of strength and the hair goes down but 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:20.259
 anyway that hair that beautiful sbs 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:22.360
 mustache was going to fall then I do not know 

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:25.389
 worry another one comes in its place and the 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:29.700
 as you see, I lose locking myself 

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:33.050
 I will lose about five beautiful daily 

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:33.050
 and you 

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:40.410
 well they are new to tomÃ¡s 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:40.410
 very many 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:46.580
 of interest still 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:46.580
 and later 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:51.950
 co
