00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
not have been spectacular this game but

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:03.680 
not have been spectacular this game but
it<00:04:01.740> did<00:04:01.920> draw<00:04:02.160> so<00:04:02.610> much<00:04:02.640> attention<00:04:03.000> from

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.690 
it did draw so much attention from

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:05.720 
it did draw so much attention from
Samsung<00:04:04.170> it<00:04:04.320> at<00:04:04.410> the<00:04:04.470> very<00:04:04.500> least<00:04:04.830> that's<00:04:05.100> what

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:05.730 
Samsung it at the very least that's what

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:08.960 
Samsung it at the very least that's what
this<00:04:05.910> rise<00:04:06.240> can<00:04:06.570> do<00:04:06.780> 15<00:04:07.200> point<00:04:07.500> 10<00:04:07.740> is<00:04:08.040> make<00:04:08.940> a

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 
this rise can do 15 point 10 is make a

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:11.449 
this rise can do 15 point 10 is make a
big<00:04:09.300> big<00:04:10.020> difference<00:04:10.320> actually<00:04:10.709> grounded<00:04:11.400> a

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459 
big big difference actually grounded a

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:13.160 
big big difference actually grounded a
lot<00:04:11.490> of<00:04:11.850> damage<00:04:12.090> on<00:04:12.360> Victor<00:04:12.690> that<00:04:12.810> game<00:04:12.990> he<00:04:13.080> did

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:13.170 
lot of damage on Victor that game he did

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:14.570 
lot of damage on Victor that game he did
more<00:04:13.260> damage<00:04:13.320> than<00:04:13.650> anyone<00:04:13.920> else<00:04:14.070> to<00:04:14.190> champion

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:14.580 
more damage than anyone else to champion

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:16.430 
more damage than anyone else to champion
so<00:04:14.730> he<00:04:14.910> played<00:04:15.330> pretty<00:04:15.930> well<00:04:16.020> actually

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 
so he played pretty well actually

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.440 
so he played pretty well actually
considering<00:04:17.250> the<00:04:17.370> circumstances<00:04:18.209> of<00:04:18.390> his

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:18.450 
considering the circumstances of his

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:20.420 
considering the circumstances of his
laning<00:04:18.750> phase<00:04:19.080> he<00:04:19.320> tried<00:04:19.620> I<00:04:19.650> mean<00:04:19.920> he<00:04:20.190> did<00:04:20.340> the

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 
laning phase he tried I mean he did the

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:22.330 
laning phase he tried I mean he did the
best<00:04:20.549> he<00:04:20.700> could

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:22.340 
best he could

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:24.640 
best he could
but<00:04:22.940> that<00:04:23.270> was<00:04:23.360> an<00:04:23.480> awkward<00:04:23.600> game<00:04:24.020> I<00:04:24.230> was<00:04:24.440> weird

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:24.650
