00:03:25.509 --> 00:03:25.519 
this is basically what it looks like in

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:27.550 
this is basically what it looks like in
my<00:03:25.549> room<00:03:25.670> after<00:03:26.180> I<00:03:26.209> film<00:03:26.480> I<00:03:26.690> did<00:03:27.200> have<00:03:27.379> to<00:03:27.530> use

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:27.560 
my room after I film I did have to use

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:30.759 
my room after I film I did have to use
my<00:03:28.250> lights<00:03:28.909> this<00:03:29.329> time<00:03:29.569> because<00:03:30.109> the<00:03:30.560> Sun

00:03:30.759 --> 00:03:30.769 
my lights this time because the Sun

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:33.970 
my lights this time because the Sun
actually<00:03:31.250> went<00:03:31.430> down<00:03:31.519> um<00:03:32.590> not<00:03:33.590> all<00:03:33.620> the<00:03:33.890> way

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
actually went down um not all the way

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:37.000 
actually went down um not all the way
but<00:03:34.010> it's<00:03:34.579> just<00:03:34.879> it's<00:03:35.150> not<00:03:35.269> enough<00:03:36.049> light<00:03:36.290> to

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.010 
but it's just it's not enough light to

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:38.410 
but it's just it's not enough light to
come<00:03:37.129> in<00:03:37.190> so<00:03:37.549> I<00:03:37.579> think<00:03:37.790> the<00:03:38.030> lighting<00:03:38.269> looks

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:38.420 
come in so I think the lighting looks

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:39.819 
come in so I think the lighting looks
really<00:03:38.629> good<00:03:38.750> though<00:03:38.900> I'm<00:03:39.650> actually

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:39.829 
really good though I'm actually

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:41.649 
really good though I'm actually
surprised<00:03:40.400> because<00:03:40.940> I<00:03:41.090> didn't<00:03:41.480> think<00:03:41.510> you

00:03:41.649 --> 00:03:41.659 
surprised because I didn't think you

00:03:41.659 --> 00:03:43.180 
surprised because I didn't think you
look<00:03:41.870> good<00:03:41.989> I<00:03:42.200> think<00:03:42.470> the<00:03:42.620> way<00:03:42.709> I<00:03:42.739> set<00:03:43.069> up<00:03:43.099> my

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:43.190 
look good I think the way I set up my

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:46.420 
look good I think the way I set up my
lights<00:03:43.519> is<00:03:43.930> um<00:03:44.930> I<00:03:45.019> needed<00:03:45.530> one<00:03:45.799> that<00:03:45.829> was<00:03:46.130> on<00:03:46.250> me

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430 
lights is um I needed one that was on me

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:48.460 
lights is um I needed one that was on me
here<00:03:46.819> but<00:03:47.000> then<00:03:47.090> I<00:03:47.150> also<00:03:47.329> needed<00:03:47.690> another<00:03:47.930> over

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:48.470 
here but then I also needed another over

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:50.740 
here but then I also needed another over
here<00:03:48.769> that<00:03:49.010> would<00:03:49.130> hit<00:03:49.370> this<00:03:49.880> wall<00:03:50.180> because

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:50.750 
here that would hit this wall because

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:53.349 
here that would hit this wall because
what<00:03:51.680> I<00:03:51.709> have<00:03:51.980> the<00:03:52.220> one<00:03:52.430> light<00:03:52.669> hitting<00:03:53.180> me

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:53.359 
what I have the one light hitting me

00:03:53.359 --> 00:03:54.970 
what I have the one light hitting me
it's<00:03:53.780> not<00:03:54.019> enough<00:03:54.230> light<00:03:54.470> like<00:03:54.739> in<00:03:54.889> the

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:54.980 
it's not enough light like in the

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:57.190 
it's not enough light like in the
background<00:03:55.269> but<00:03:56.269> I<00:03:56.299> think<00:03:56.660> it<00:03:56.750> came<00:03:56.840> out<00:03:56.989> good

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:57.200 
background but I think it came out good

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:59.229 
background but I think it came out good
so<00:03:57.440> I'm<00:03:57.680> gonna<00:03:57.799> go<00:03:58.010> edit<00:03:58.280> back<00:03:58.549> it's<00:03:58.879> around

00:03:59.229 --> 00:03:59.239 
so I'm gonna go edit back it's around

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:00.970 
so I'm gonna go edit back it's around
like<00:03:59.450> for<00:03:59.690> something<00:03:59.989> and<00:04:00.500> figure<00:04:00.769> out<00:04:00.829> what

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:00.980 
like for something and figure out what

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:02.050 
like for something and figure out what
