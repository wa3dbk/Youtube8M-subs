is<00:02:09.810> maybe<00:02:10.110> it's<00:02:10.320> not<00:02:10.440> like<00:02:10.590> initial<00:02:11.210> like

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:12.210 
is maybe it's not like initial like

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:14.750 
is maybe it's not like initial like
energy<00:02:12.720> surge<00:02:13.020> after<00:02:13.560> your<00:02:14.010> lifting<00:02:14.490> for<00:02:14.730> a

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
little bit but you up the weight and

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.140 
little bit but you up the weight and
it's<00:02:18.720> easy<00:02:19.080> it's<00:02:19.830> really<00:02:20.040> weird<00:02:20.340> like<00:02:20.760> it<00:02:21.000> will

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
it's easy it's really weird like it will

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.240 
it's easy it's really weird like it will
be<00:02:21.300> easy<00:02:21.600> and<00:02:21.840> you<00:02:21.960> should<00:02:22.170> do<00:02:22.530> ten<00:02:22.830> reps<00:02:23.100> just

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
be easy and you should do ten reps just

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.740 
be easy and you should do ten reps just
like<00:02:24.020> like<00:02:25.020> that<00:02:25.170> but<00:02:26.090> sometimes<00:02:27.090> it's<00:02:27.390> just<00:02:27.630> a

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
like like that but sometimes it's just a

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.500 
like like that but sometimes it's just a
struggle<00:02:27.990> and<00:02:28.530> today<00:02:29.220> I<00:02:29.250> killed<00:02:30.090> it<00:02:30.240> and<00:02:30.450> I
