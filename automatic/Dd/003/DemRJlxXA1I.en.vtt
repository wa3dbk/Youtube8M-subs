that you find on the coastal areas like
this<00:00:22.150> now<00:00:22.779> if<00:00:23.109> you<00:00:23.289> do<00:00:23.439> want<00:00:23.619> to<00:00:23.650> eat<00:00:23.710> them<00:00:24.089> the

this now if you do want to eat them the

00:00:25.089 --> 00:00:27.900 
this now if you do want to eat them the
best<00:00:25.419> way<00:00:25.599> is<00:00:25.660> to<00:00:25.720> boil<00:00:26.019> them<00:00:26.169> for<00:00:26.609> five<00:00:27.609> to<00:00:27.759> 10

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:27.910 
best way is to boil them for five to 10

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:30.269 
best way is to boil them for five to 10
minutes<00:00:28.150> at<00:00:28.269> motion<00:00:28.449> and<00:00:28.749> then<00:00:29.130> flick<00:00:30.130> them

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:30.279 
minutes at motion and then flick them

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:33.180 
minutes at motion and then flick them
out<00:00:30.400> with<00:00:30.730> a<00:00:30.759> thorn<00:00:31.179> or<00:00:31.390> a<00:00:31.509> pin<00:00:32.050> and<00:00:32.349> dip<00:00:33.040> them

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:33.190 
out with a thorn or a pin and dip them

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:35.610 
out with a thorn or a pin and dip them
in<00:00:33.310> some<00:00:33.340> vinegar<00:00:33.700> and<00:00:33.880> some<00:00:34.150> pepper<00:00:34.420> and<00:00:34.750> they

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:35.620 
in some vinegar and some pepper and they

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:37.350 
in some vinegar and some pepper and they
are<00:00:35.680> a<00:00:35.890> great<00:00:36.370> little<00:00:36.670> snack<00:00:36.940> when<00:00:37.150> you<00:00:37.210> have

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:37.360 
are a great little snack when you have

are a great little snack when you have
them<00:00:37.480> that<00:00:37.629> way<00:00:37.890> here<00:00:38.890> we<00:00:39.010> have<00:00:39.160> probably<00:00:39.640> the

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:39.760 
them that way here we have probably the

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.310 
them that way here we have probably the
easiest<00:00:40.149> food<00:00:40.449> source<00:00:40.780> you<00:00:40.960> can<00:00:41.079> find

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:41.320 
easiest food source you can find

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:42.630 
easiest food source you can find
anywhere<00:00:41.770> on<00:00:41.829> the<00:00:41.980> planet<00:00:42.280> which<00:00:42.430> is<00:00:42.460> the

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:42.640 
anywhere on the planet which is the

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.970 
anywhere on the planet which is the
limpet<00:00:43.180> so<00:00:43.449> if<00:00:43.750> you're<00:00:43.989> on<00:00:44.230> the<00:00:44.260> coastline<00:00:44.800> and

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:44.980 
limpet so if you're on the coastline and

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:46.740 
limpet so if you're on the coastline and
you<00:00:45.520> can't<00:00:45.699> find<00:00:45.879> any<00:00:46.059> other<00:00:46.120> source<00:00:46.480> of<00:00:46.600> food

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:46.750 
you can't find any other source of food

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:49.170 
you can't find any other source of food
these<00:00:47.620> little<00:00:47.980> fellas<00:00:48.309> are<00:00:48.489> well<00:00:49.000> worth

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:49.180 
these little fellas are well worth

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:51.209 
these little fellas are well worth
collecting<00:00:49.480> and<00:00:49.809> that's<00:00:50.680> another<00:00:50.859> thing<00:00:50.980> in

00:00:51.209 --> 00:00:51.219 
collecting and that's another thing in

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:52.950 
collecting and that's another thing in
Britain<00:00:51.340> very<00:00:51.670> few<00:00:51.879> people<00:00:52.000> eat<00:00:52.149> these<00:00:52.329> but<00:00:52.629> in

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:52.960 
Britain very few people eat these but in

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.819 
Britain very few people eat these but in
in<00:00:53.829> France<00:00:54.190> they're<00:00:54.760> a<00:00:54.789> popular<00:00:55.000> delicacy<00:00:55.329> so

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
in France they're a popular delicacy so

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.229 
in France they're a popular delicacy so
what<00:00:56.829> we<00:00:56.920> need<00:00:57.039> to<00:00:57.129> do<00:00:57.250> is<00:00:57.460> to<00:00:57.760> sneak<00:00:58.059> up

00:00:58.229 --> 00:00:58.239 
what we need to do is to sneak up

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:00.000 
what we need to do is to sneak up
because<00:00:58.809> they<00:00:58.929> can<00:00:59.050> feel<00:00:59.230> the<00:00:59.320> vibrations<00:00:59.859> as

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:00.010 
because they can feel the vibrations as

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:01.560 
because they can feel the vibrations as
we<00:01:00.129> approach<00:01:00.399> them<00:01:00.609> so<00:01:00.670> if<00:01:00.850> we<00:01:00.940> sneak<00:01:01.000> up<00:01:01.390> very

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:01.570 
we approach them so if we sneak up very

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:02.939 
we approach them so if we sneak up very
carefully<00:01:02.050> we<00:01:02.140> should<00:01:02.320> be<00:01:02.379> like<00:01:02.500> tap<00:01:02.710> them<00:01:02.859> off

00:01:02.939 --> 00:01:02.949 
carefully we should be like tap them off

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:04.410 
carefully we should be like tap them off
the<00:01:03.070> rock<00:01:03.219> either<00:01:03.429> with<00:01:03.579> our<00:01:03.609> foot<00:01:03.940> or<00:01:04.180> with<00:01:04.360> a

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:04.420 
the rock either with our foot or with a

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:06.510 
the rock either with our foot or with a
small<00:01:04.720> stone<00:01:05.050> without<00:01:05.710> too<00:01:05.980> much<00:01:06.100> trouble

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:06.520 
small stone without too much trouble

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:07.890 
small stone without too much trouble
but<00:01:06.730> if<00:01:06.910> they<00:01:07.060> know<00:01:07.240> you're<00:01:07.360> coming<00:01:07.420> they're

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:07.900 
but if they know you're coming they're

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:09.210 
but if they know you're coming they're
going<00:01:08.020> to<00:01:08.080> clamp<00:01:08.320> down<00:01:08.410> really<00:01:08.770> hard<00:01:08.860> and

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:09.220 
going to clamp down really hard and

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:13.380 
going to clamp down really hard and
they're<00:01:09.580> a<00:01:09.610> nightmare<00:01:09.850> to<00:01:10.060> get<00:01:10.210> off<00:01:10.920> so<00:01:12.390> this

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:13.390 
they're a nightmare to get off so this

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:15.990 
they're a nightmare to get off so this
muscular<00:01:13.840> foot<00:01:14.140> here<00:01:14.380> sucks<00:01:15.370> itself<00:01:15.760> to<00:01:15.910> the

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:16.000 
muscular foot here sucks itself to the

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.900 
muscular foot here sucks itself to the
rock<00:01:16.180> clamps<00:01:16.780> it<00:01:16.900> down<00:01:17.050> hard<00:01:17.290> and<00:01:17.880> unlike<00:01:18.880> a

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:18.910 
rock clamps it down hard and unlike a

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:20.760 
rock clamps it down hard and unlike a
lot<00:01:19.000> of<00:01:19.180> the<00:01:19.270> sea<00:01:20.170> creatures<00:01:20.530> that<00:01:20.560> we're

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:20.770 
lot of the sea creatures that we're

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:22.230 
lot of the sea creatures that we're
looking<00:01:20.860> at<00:01:21.100> around<00:01:21.220> here<00:01:21.430> these<00:01:21.580> are<00:01:21.760> forages

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:22.240 
looking at around here these are forages

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.540 
looking at around here these are forages
so<00:01:22.900> they<00:01:23.050> actually<00:01:23.200> graze<00:01:23.740> on<00:01:24.100> the<00:01:24.250> rocks

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:24.550 
so they actually graze on the rocks

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:27.660 
so they actually graze on the rocks
so<00:01:25.420> rather<00:01:25.840> than<00:01:26.110> by<00:01:26.680> valves<00:01:27.040> which<00:01:27.190> suck<00:01:27.520> in

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:27.670 
so rather than by valves which suck in

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:29.250 
so rather than by valves which suck in
water<00:01:27.910> and<00:01:28.180> get<00:01:28.330> their<00:01:28.480> food<00:01:28.660> from<00:01:28.720> that<00:01:29.110> what

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:29.260 
water and get their food from that what

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.560 
water and get their food from that what
these<00:01:29.410> guys<00:01:29.620> do<00:01:29.860> is<00:01:30.040> roam<00:01:30.640> around<00:01:30.790> on<00:01:31.150> the

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:31.570 
these guys do is roam around on the

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:33.450 
these guys do is roam around on the
surface<00:01:31.720> of<00:01:31.990> the<00:01:32.050> rocks<00:01:32.230> sucking<00:01:32.980> algae<00:01:33.370> and

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:33.460 
surface of the rocks sucking algae and

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.340 
surface of the rocks sucking algae and
other<00:01:33.610> food<00:01:33.850> sources<00:01:34.180> from<00:01:34.510> that<00:01:34.720> and<00:01:34.930> then

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:35.350 
other food sources from that and then

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:37.680 
other food sources from that and then
they<00:01:35.470> return<00:01:35.770> back<00:01:35.800> to<00:01:36.220> their<00:01:36.370> original<00:01:37.000> spot

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:37.690 
they return back to their original spot

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:39.180 
they return back to their original spot
but<00:01:38.170> when<00:01:38.290> the<00:01:38.380> tide<00:01:38.560> goes<00:01:38.800> out<00:01:38.920> and<00:01:39.100> they

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:39.190 
but when the tide goes out and they

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:40.620 
but when the tide goes out and they
clamp<00:01:39.430> themselves<00:01:39.850> down<00:01:40.000> and<00:01:40.210> just<00:01:40.330> store

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:40.630 
clamp themselves down and just store

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:42.780 
clamp themselves down and just store
enough<00:01:41.380> sea<00:01:41.560> water<00:01:41.830> to<00:01:42.040> keep<00:01:42.520> them<00:01:42.670> going

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:42.790 
enough sea water to keep them going

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:45.590 
enough sea water to keep them going
until<00:01:43.030> the<00:01:43.210> tide<00:01:43.390> comes<00:01:43.600> back<00:01:43.690> in<00:01:43.840> again<00:01:44.140> and

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
until the tide comes back in again and
