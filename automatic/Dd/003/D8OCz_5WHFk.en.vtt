00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.220 
I'm hoping instead a little easier so
but<00:01:50.340> the<00:01:51.090> main<00:01:51.270> difference<00:01:51.300> is<00:01:51.840> that<00:01:51.900> you

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:52.230 
but the main difference is that you

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:55.280 
but the main difference is that you
control<00:01:52.590> with<00:01:52.770> the<00:01:52.890> mouse<00:01:53.070> so<00:01:53.640> you<00:01:53.700> can<00:01:54.290> like

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
control with the mouse so you can like

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.230 
control with the mouse so you can like
target<00:01:55.710> an<00:01:55.800> enemy<00:01:56.130> click<00:01:56.520> on<00:01:56.670> it<00:01:56.790> then<00:01:56.910> you<00:01:57.030> go

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
target an enemy click on it then you go

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.690 
target an enemy click on it then you go
right<00:01:57.270> over<00:01:57.840> to<00:01:58.350> it<00:01:58.650> so<00:01:58.830> you<00:01:59.040> don't<00:01:59.160> shoot<00:01:59.550> in

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
right over to it so you don't shoot in

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.090 
right over to it so you don't shoot in
the<00:01:59.730> game<00:01:59.940> you<00:02:00.060> actually<00:02:00.420> punch<00:02:00.900> so<00:02:01.800> how<00:02:01.920> long

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
the game you actually punch so how long

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.560 
the game you actually punch so how long
has<00:02:02.310> the<00:02:02.400> game<00:02:02.550> been<00:02:03.000> in<00:02:03.030> development<00:02:03.240> for

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
has the game been in development for

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.200 
has the game been in development for
it's<00:02:04.170> just<00:02:04.410> eight<00:02:04.560> months<00:02:04.740> but<00:02:05.460> this<00:02:05.880> will<00:02:06.060> be

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
it's just eight months but this will be

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.719 
it's just eight months but this will be
made<00:02:06.510> of<00:02:06.630> levels<00:02:07.080> already<00:02:07.350> so<00:02:07.920> you<00:02:08.580> did

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
made of levels already so you did

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.609 
made of levels already so you did
everything<00:02:08.850> yourself<00:02:09.180> yeah<00:02:09.810> so<00:02:10.260> it<00:02:10.410> went

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
everything yourself yeah so it went

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:15.650 
everything yourself yeah so it went

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.560 
tell me about the concept of the game I
mean<00:02:35.880> it<00:02:36.000> looks<00:02:36.120> really<00:02:36.450> original<00:02:36.770> you<00:02:37.770> drag

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:38.570 
mean it looks really original you drag

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:42.290 
mean it looks really original you drag
squirming<00:02:39.570> living<00:02:40.110> balls<00:02:40.590> of<00:02:40.950> goo<00:02:41.340> and<00:02:42.120> you

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
squirming living balls of goo and you

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.120 
squirming living balls of goo and you
build<00:02:42.480> structures<00:02:42.780> to<00:02:43.350> get<00:02:43.500> somewhere<00:02:43.890> and

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
build structures to get somewhere and

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.550 
build structures to get somewhere and
you<00:02:44.190> collect<00:02:44.340> goo<00:02:44.730> to<00:02:45.330> go<00:02:45.690> into<00:02:46.080> the<00:02:46.200> World<00:02:46.380> of

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
you collect goo to go into the World of

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.590 
you collect goo to go into the World of
Goo<00:02:46.590> corporation<00:02:47.000> this<00:02:48.000> is<00:02:48.150> the<00:02:48.270> first<00:02:48.480> game

a<00:03:09.420> little<00:03:09.540> bit<00:03:09.660> about<00:03:09.840> fez<00:03:10.080> fez<00:03:10.650> is<00:03:11.580> a<00:03:11.610> game

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
a little bit about fez fez is a game

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:15.290 
a little bit about fez fez is a game
that<00:03:11.970> we've<00:03:12.720> made<00:03:12.930> it's<00:03:13.200> a<00:03:13.410> 2d<00:03:13.950> 3d<00:03:14.519> game<00:03:14.730> most

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:15.300 
that we've made it's a 2d 3d game most

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.930 
that we've made it's a 2d 3d game most
of<00:03:15.390> the<00:03:15.480> game<00:03:15.630> plays<00:03:15.900> 2d<00:03:16.739> like<00:03:17.040> Mario<00:03:17.430> type<00:03:17.760> of

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
of the game plays 2d like Mario type of

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:21.530 
of the game plays 2d like Mario type of
things<00:03:18.120> but<00:03:18.570> you<00:03:19.170> can<00:03:19.350> rotate<00:03:19.560> the<00:03:20.100> world<00:03:20.550> 90

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
things but you can rotate the world 90

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:24.229 
things but you can rotate the world 90
degrees<00:03:21.810> at<00:03:21.959> a<00:03:21.989> time<00:03:22.230> so<00:03:22.920> you<00:03:23.340> never<00:03:23.489> play<00:03:23.880> it

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
degrees at a time so you never play it

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:27.229 
degrees at a time so you never play it
in<00:03:24.420> 3d<00:03:24.900> it's<00:03:25.050> always<00:03:25.320> 2d<00:03:25.709> gameplay<00:03:25.980> but<00:03:26.760> the

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 
in 3d it's always 2d gameplay but the

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:28.729 
in 3d it's always 2d gameplay but the
rotation<00:03:27.690> of<00:03:27.780> the<00:03:27.870> world<00:03:28.080> that's<00:03:28.350> a<00:03:28.530> whole

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
rotation of the world that's a whole

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:31.340 
rotation of the world that's a whole
like<00:03:29.100> puzzle<00:03:29.580> element<00:03:30.300> to<00:03:30.450> it<00:03:30.570> how<00:03:30.989> long<00:03:31.140> has

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:31.350 
like puzzle element to it how long has

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:33.590 
like puzzle element to it how long has
it<00:03:31.380> been<00:03:31.530> in<00:03:31.890> development<00:03:32.010> for<00:03:32.480> it's<00:03:33.480> been

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:33.600 
it been in development for it's been

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:35.990 
it been in development for it's been
about<00:03:33.780> three<00:03:34.230> months<00:03:34.410> from<00:03:34.890> like<00:03:35.400> the<00:03:35.670> their

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
about three months from like the their

about three months from like the their
actual<00:03:36.300> beginning<00:03:36.420> and<00:03:36.810> the<00:03:36.870> development
