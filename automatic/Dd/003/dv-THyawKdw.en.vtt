00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:11.580
 On April 15 , SÃ­ragon returned to 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.860
 show that you are one step ahead in 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.410
 the national technology market and 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:19.140
 consumer electronics the launch of 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:22.470
 the tablet with processor 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:25.410
 nvidia tegra quad-core placed 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.060
 placed the Venezuelan manufacturer in a 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.590
 computation category that still its 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.930
 local competitors have not been able to 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.120
 to arrive and is to launch not only a 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:36.420
 team with android ice cream but that 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.789
 already places in the national market a 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.260
 technology or place a technology with 

00:00:38.789 --> 00:00:43.050
 a quad -core processor that will 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.809
 will allow any user to enter 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.370
 that wants the tablet to be able to have a 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.859
 computational processing capacity 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.390
 very very important what would be the 

00:00:49.859 --> 00:00:52.920
 element that we would have to analyze if 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.210
 truly the rest the challenge that 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.620
 will have what to prove in the 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.929
 next days in the capacity of 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.359
 response have the support of the group 

00:00:57.929 --> 00:01:02.460
 green roof or be part of the group 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.860
 guarantee will guarantee you a 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.440
 important distribution throughout the country 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:10.210
 the demand the demand we estimate is going to be 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:12.130
 important unless the price 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:13.650
 worth more than the need creating 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:16.360
 in some users acquire a computer 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.220
 truly innovative and that will be a 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.860
 step ahead of other tablets 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:23.590
 including the famous and the very 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:25.509
 quoted ipad from apple in the 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:28.180
 opportunity was also very important and 

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:30.640
 that we think it's important to talk 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:32.380
 about what it will mean for the market 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.479
 Venezuelan 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.979
 the product will be complete but with play 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:38.229
 it's an offer that maybe some 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:39.550
 we could compare with what the 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:42.850
 icon with what was the icloud of apple 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:44.500
 last year give a synchronization a 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:46.300
 cloud storage that you 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.670
 allow users of the equipment 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:52.860
 be able to have products but I think 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:54.970
 that will be with more adapts in your store your 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.380
 storage system adapts it more to 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:58.240
 the characteristics that we have in the 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:00.820
 Venezuelan market what are those 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.920
 characteristics I bring a country that does not 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.539
 a country is fully banked 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.060
 where the credit cards either 

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:09.250
 a country that is very crowded 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:11.620
 requires that you need to have methods that 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:14.410
 be incentives to bankize so that 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:15.640
 people go to the bank and to operations 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:18.370
 electronic this is going to be a bet 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.570
 important now well where would the 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:21.460
 arguments that we should consider 

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:22.420
 us what is the capacity of 

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:24.010
 answer that will have the 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:25.600
 developer want to place 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:28.060
 products in bolivars that are going to be 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:30.030
 paid in bolivars obviously if any 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.890
 I imagine that we estimate that it will guarantee 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:34.330
 a purchase because we believe it will guarantee 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:35.890
 a negotiation with these 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.660
 developers to ensure that that 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:38.890
 payment also be dollars a lot good 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:40.930
 he wants his payments in dollars 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:42.790
 but they are let's say agreement that if I have 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.770
 will have to do not only with the 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:46.540
 with the developers but also with 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:48.550
 the headquarters of the stores 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:51.820
 we talk about an android google 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:54.820
 example even microsoft with his with his 

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:55.660
 marketplace and obviously rim with its 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:57.850
 blackberry 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:59.830
 son his store word that would be a 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:02.440
 important element an important point 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:04.810
 because because we could be seeing 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.310
 how from our own 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.140
 needs from our own 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:10.360
 realities can be developing 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:11.890
 creating a business concept a 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:13.540
 concept development industry 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:15.610
 information technology 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:17.050
 obviously focused on the concept of 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:19.270
 development of applications and 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:20.500
 products and products online would be 

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:22.180
 interesting would be 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.830
 very important for the country would be very 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.870
 important for the massification of 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:27.730
 industry and the commerce industry 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:30.460
 electronic that large chains of 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:31.960
 stores chain stores chains 

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:34.600
 who sell mass-consumption products 

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:36.700
 be encouraged to develop products here 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:38.860
 some applications that could also 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:40.120
 generate a cell phone to the user 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:41.620
 ability the possibility of power 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.440
 buy these products through a 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:45.760
 mobile technology would be very important not 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:48.790
 just to do something that obviously 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:50.260
 guarantee the sale and guarantee the 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:52.510
 placement of their products but for the 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:54.580
 market that will have a face one 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:56.590
 alternative to encourage trade 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:58.600
 electronic electronic activities 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:00.760
 through means that may be at 

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:02.350
 reach of your hand who should be another 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:04.630
 contestant here for this site 

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:07.030
 complete a success obviously the 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:08.800
 institutions of the state and because when 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:10.090
 a government promotes the use of 

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:11.890
 information technologies should 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:13.810
 also be open enough 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:16.750
 as to understand that the technologies 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:19.600
 of information can be a device 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:21.590
 super useful for questioning for 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:23.060
 the criticism and for the complaint 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:25.910
 the citizens also have to have 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:27.889
 access to services and be able to process more 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:29.500
 easily their services and could be 

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:31.760
 This is an ideal way for 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:33.440
 State institutions also create 

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:35.330
 their applications place them in these 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:37.340
 spaces and users can perform 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:39.860
 your service or perform your operations 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:41.389
 electronic in it then going a 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:42.590
 little further on we can understand that what 

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:43.610
 what did you do, irak or not what you will do 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:45.830
 we will go from next year 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:48.620
 Consider with play can be an element 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:50.479
 market dynamic a very element 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:52.760
 valuable for electronic commerce and that 

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:55.610
 would force and I hope we hope it is 

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:57.590
 so the government to expedite pending 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:59.570
 one of the most important the invoice 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:01.130
 electronic without electronic invoice the 

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:03.410
 tax collection of the state itself 

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:06.200
 depletion and the chances that 

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:07.940
 companies incentive and generate more 

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:10.310
 electronic commerce will also slow down 

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:12.440
 because they will not be able to dispose if there is not 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:14.990
 a legalization on this matter does not 

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:16.820
 they will be able to legalize this collection of 

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:18.560
 taxes and also the withholdings 

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:20.090
 respective so that this can be 

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:22.639
 a step forward we hope that there 

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:25.160
 enough mental openness and openness in 

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:26.780
 negotiations so that others 

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:28.730
 important points for 

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:30.889
 in a play or other app store 

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:32.840
 or another product with this feature 

00:05:30.889 --> 00:05:34.360
 is that if it succeeds, it will be successful 

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:36.030
 necessary for all actors 

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:39.050
 concur 

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:39.050
 thank you
