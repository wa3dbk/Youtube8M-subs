00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:06.210
 very good hours how about antonius 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:10.259
 commenting and today I bring you a tutorial 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:13.170
 of unity 3d I know he had very abandoned 

00:00:10.259 --> 00:00:15.209
 this graphic engine but that's not why I'm going 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.560
 to stop doing tutorials what happens 

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:19.320
 is that I will not do them frequently 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.160
 since in my opinion it is better engine 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.050
 vk graphic 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:25.540
 but that you are also going to find 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:26.740
 tutorials on my channel about him but not 

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:29.410
 it means to stop doing 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:32.259
 tutorials about this and about others 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:35.850
 many graphics engines and good in this 

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:40.269
 tutorial we will also learn to 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:43.600
 put water with sound included is 

00:00:40.269 --> 00:00:45.590
 the sounds of the water and I will leave you in the 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.660
 description 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:51.560
 the pair of sounds to you that 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:53.710
 add simply you will have a file 

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:56.469
 for example here 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:57.940
 this for example if this were the 

00:00:56.469 --> 00:01:00.090
 sound file you will simply have 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.360
 to drag up here is worth 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.210
 simply that 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:08.330
 and good once we have here in my 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:12.730
 case is this I already have it imported 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.730
 let's find a water here 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:20.720
 and we are going to catch tail like without losing what 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:22.640
 we drag here forgiveness daylight no 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.830
 good this according to the taste of each one to 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.200
 I like more mixed invade the water of 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:29.020
 night 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:33.009
 and we are going to take this 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:35.649
 I like more this is my taste but not 

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:37.840
 why is it better or worse worth 

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:40.890
 everyone can take the one they want, let's go 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.890
 to see if this looks good 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.500
 we already see that it is 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.180
 put more or less 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:57.250
 and now we're going to pick up the sounds myself 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:02:01.260
 example I have here in sounds do not have 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:01.260
 you and drag it jce here 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:09.350
 this is the have 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.480
 sound 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:14.750
 we can not make bigger smaller 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:17.920
 to see without modifying the water we are going to 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.920
 try to make it bigger 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:24.500
 we see that we can not because it is to see 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:34.590
 and we see that we can not the sound not what 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:38.240
 we can modify it because it's worth 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:40.850
 embedded here in the river that is 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:43.370
 in the properties of this river good of 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:46.990
 this lake here we see that it has already been 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:49.330
 shourd worth the laudio 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:50.710
 here we are going to modify good does not 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:54.040
 we need to modify any parameter 

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:55.420
 because if we want a 3d water is worth and 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.720
 well let's run the game to see 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:59.060
 How are you 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:01.960
 with those two simple steps let's see 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.960
 how it has been 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.340
 by the way this is the map of my 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:09.240
 unity tutorial of creating a town in 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.740
 3-d is worth 

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:12.420
 maybe I 'm seeing some kind of 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:15.740
 the vall is normal because I'm recording 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:18.090
 with win time everything on my computer there is no 

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:21.000
 no one is worth it and yours I think 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:25.830
 neither will there be simply because in 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:28.980
 Win Htein cable while there is less 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:34.069
 is recording something like a game in this 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:39.249
 case your game it takes longer 

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:39.249
 so go with it and let's see here 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:48.170
 I do not know if you can appreciate the 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:48.170
 ballet sound 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:51.970
 let's stop we're going to put a little 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:54.060
 more on salt equipment and capable of 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:57.830
 appreciate what's worth 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:04:00.599
 but I'm hearing it, let's go 

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:03.660
 a linear we are going to change it here in 

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:05.220
 line or in custom we even go to 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:09.500
 leave it in just 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:09.500
 and we are going to give you the play 

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:15.250
 as we can see the micro waits well 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:15.250
 so you can hear it 

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:25.930
 As we can see, the water sounds 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:28.390
 and well this is a pretty water 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:30.280
 simple that you can implement 

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:33.010
 in your project 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:35.170
 and good to say since I hope that 

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:37.780
 you have learned a lot and see you 

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:41.100
 in the next tutorial a greeting and 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:41.100
 see you later bye
