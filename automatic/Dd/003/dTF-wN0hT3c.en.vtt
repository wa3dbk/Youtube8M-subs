00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:24.489
 the coaches themselves can see that they are much 

00:00:24.489 --> 00:00:26.909
 quality collected than many previous 

00:00:26.909 --> 00:00:29.909
 other film coaches our practically 

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:33.110
 it is the result of some 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:35.790
 domestic progress 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.800
 it had to study there 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.650
 abroad for someone else for example if 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:45.320
 he has a lot of people 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.320
 here are the ones 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:51.469
 in the end stayed 

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:54.469
 the canvas was made only 19 years old 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:56.350
 Andrei Martirosov 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:58.590
 the entrance kind of worked for a long time these 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:59.670
 coaches 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:00.790
 question 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:02.770
 he succeeded but we had a very 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:05.820
 difficult task 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.400
 when a trainer is cut it is due to 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.770
 so that 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.270
 in Russia in general, a very large distrust square 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:16.260
 but a movie estimate 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:17.430
 in Russia 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.430
 in action genre 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.620
 most people think that 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:27.260
 I canâ€™t repair 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:31.329
 her most people who concerts 

00:01:31.329 --> 00:01:34.099
 after her death he is very important something 

00:01:34.099 --> 00:01:35.390
 made 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:36.710
 m 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:38.690
 In Russian cinema, therefore, the task was 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:39.880
 very difficult 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.229
 on the one hand, do not stick that pettai 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.229
 action movie 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:47.900
 the job 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:50.900
 to focus on some other things 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:53.400
 according to the film 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.560
 but on the other hand all the same how to show that 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.560
 all the same UAH which 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.720
 adventure 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.830
 into the program 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:07.050
 Novoseltseva was very hard that either 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:09.519
 do it 

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:12.780
 I hope that the tour Dima slovtitsa what 

00:02:12.779 --> 00:02:14.809
 the degree and the director who had to this 

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:16.389
 direct relationship 

00:02:16.389 --> 00:02:18.729
 something never happened before 

00:02:18.729 --> 00:02:21.389
 in the Russian cinema that the usual 

00:02:21.389 --> 00:02:24.639
 advertising promises others 

00:02:24.639 --> 00:02:26.760
 But how did they cope with this task? 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.760
 A. Neterenko and no 

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:33.879
 everything else just people flying 

00:02:35.929 --> 00:02:38.989
 but mounting rules 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:41.119
 in industries 

00:02:41.119 --> 00:02:42.869
 write it will not fit us 

00:02:42.869 --> 00:02:44.899
 construction of the page 

00:02:44.899 --> 00:02:47.899
 if you do everything by the rules 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:50.919
 Tuva 

00:02:50.919 --> 00:02:53.919
 Kobudo all is well 

00:02:54.779 --> 00:02:57.719
 super zest is 

00:02:57.719 --> 00:03:00.389
 so a little bit 

00:03:00.389 --> 00:03:01.840
 the correspondent will be deleted 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.199
 besides walk sandpaper 

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:06.879
 here in one place 

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:09.199
 and this is the extra class 

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:12.110
 I will give you a simple example 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:13.829
 just with us 

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:15.949
 in the assembly profession dopofisa installation 

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:17.729
 leave the graphics 

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:19.719
 because it is easier 

00:03:19.719 --> 00:03:22.719
 here we have a film airship 

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:25.229
 which was made 

00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:28.049
 exceptionally well with somehow he is well 

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:30.469
 just the name of the impact of the month 

00:03:30.469 --> 00:03:31.230
 They are there 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:33.749
 every body language detail 

00:03:33.749 --> 00:03:36.139
 was ahead of time 200 people I went to 

00:03:36.139 --> 00:03:37.639
 Luzhkov 

00:03:37.639 --> 00:03:40.589
 now students supplements 

00:03:40.589 --> 00:03:43.809
 somewhere in the same place where it can flow 

00:03:43.809 --> 00:03:45.549
 here it is 

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:47.419
 this is the most protest to wait in 

00:03:47.419 --> 00:03:49.169
 piece of paper 

00:03:49.169 --> 00:03:51.449
 and when you reached perfection hunt 

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:54.059
 let's say visual cinema concern 

00:03:54.059 --> 00:03:55.849
 in the internal state itself 

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:57.449
 national comrade shields with 

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:59.909
 first to install the rules of the profession 

00:03:59.909 --> 00:04:02.909
 when you call for work 

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:06.459
 wood zest is to be a tad 

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:08.379
 a little bit like this would destroy a little bit 

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:09.669
 introduce them 

00:04:09.669 --> 00:04:11.559
 small dissonance 

00:04:11.559 --> 00:04:13.989
 it is then that the world arises 

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:15.139
 in that 

00:04:15.139 --> 00:04:17.219
 so it should be in the music by the way the same 

00:04:17.219 --> 00:04:18.069
 the most 

00:04:18.069 --> 00:04:21.090
 this one is very difficult to explain but 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:22.889
 The fact is that 

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:25.349
 but without this, nothing will ever happen 

00:04:25.349 --> 00:04:27.620
 simple reason 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:29.580
 pieces who and when 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:31.509
 when the guide is prisoner 

00:04:31.509 --> 00:04:33.330
 In installation Alexey wolves what the 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:34.830
 regulations 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:36.669
 you how are we who in that system 

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:40.229
 conventions which reserve not only you 

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:43.000
 so the risks viewers say so at all 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.729
 genre this is 

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:47.809
 because in the cinema that in literature it is 

00:04:47.809 --> 00:04:50.659
 some convention agreement between 

00:04:50.659 --> 00:04:52.779
 you as an author 

00:04:52.779 --> 00:04:54.699
 seeing as a performer 

00:04:54.699 --> 00:04:56.080
 works 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:59.180
 and the audience summarizing the rules 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:01.930
 cube if these rules do not change 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:05.490
 the viewer and reader the listener becomes 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:06.689
 not interested 

00:05:06.689 --> 00:05:08.969
 therefore, three professional finds 

00:05:08.969 --> 00:05:10.919
 held in the country 

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:14.240
 your sowing find is to 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:16.270
 so how do you know the rules 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:18.190
 a little bit like to expand the scope 

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:19.409
 of freedom 

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:20.729
 own 

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:23.589
 and how would this guy develop 

00:05:23.589 --> 00:05:26.219
 all that are engaged in installation 

00:05:26.219 --> 00:05:27.529
 need to know native 

00:05:27.529 --> 00:05:30.680
 simple rule 

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:32.180
 no need to do 

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:33.879
 cisco visor 

00:05:33.879 --> 00:05:35.899
 first considering the case you need to try 

00:05:35.899 --> 00:05:38.770
 to tell 

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:40.810
 but cine or there television 

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:43.830
 coherent story victory techniques further 

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:45.370
 connected story 

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:47.370
 this is the essence 

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:49.400
 any information 

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:51.250
 various pictures which 

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:54.430
 suffer for movies for programs 

00:05:54.999 --> 00:05:57.289
 only then can one begin 

00:05:57.289 --> 00:05:59.050
 do some 

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:01.409
 ingenious things this is the basis 

00:06:01.409 --> 00:06:04.409
 to begin with 

00:06:21.189 --> 00:06:24.249
 in particular 

00:06:24.249 --> 00:06:24.419
 Where
