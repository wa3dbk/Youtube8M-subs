00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:18.249 

I<00:00:16.390> think<00:00:17.390> what<00:00:17.480> makes<00:00:17.599> a<00:00:17.750> good<00:00:17.900> teacher<00:00:17.960> is

00:00:18.249 --> 00:00:18.259 
I think what makes a good teacher is

00:00:18.259 --> 00:00:22.480 
I think what makes a good teacher is
showing<00:00:19.040> a<00:00:19.279> student<00:00:19.880> what<00:00:20.450> they<00:00:20.770> can<00:00:21.770> do<00:00:21.919> not

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:22.490 
showing a student what they can do not

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:24.040 
showing a student what they can do not
what<00:00:22.700> you<00:00:22.880> can<00:00:23.000> do<00:00:23.150> and<00:00:23.480> a<00:00:23.599> lot<00:00:23.750> of<00:00:23.779> teachers

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:24.050 
what you can do and a lot of teachers

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:26.950 
what you can do and a lot of teachers
demonstrate<00:00:24.800> their<00:00:25.550> skill<00:00:25.849> you<00:00:26.689> know<00:00:26.779> and

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:26.960 
demonstrate their skill you know and

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.019 
demonstrate their skill you know and
sometimes<00:00:27.470> I've<00:00:27.770> been<00:00:28.009> to<00:00:28.160> seminars<00:00:28.790> and

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:29.029 
sometimes I've been to seminars and

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:31.299

do so I try to communicate to students

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:40.120 
do so I try to communicate to students
the<00:00:38.660> best<00:00:38.809> I<00:00:38.930> can<00:00:39.110> say<00:00:39.260> this<00:00:39.440> is<00:00:39.620> what<00:00:39.770> you<00:00:39.950> can

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:40.130 
the best I can say this is what you can

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:42.099 
the best I can say this is what you can
do<00:00:40.219> you<00:00:40.340> can<00:00:40.489> achieve<00:00:40.579> this<00:00:40.969> if<00:00:41.210> you<00:00:41.809> achieve

00:00:42.099 --> 00:00:42.109 
do you can achieve this if you achieve

00:00:42.109 --> 00:00:43.540 
do you can achieve this if you achieve
that<00:00:42.320> then<00:00:42.589> we'll<00:00:42.739> put<00:00:42.890> this<00:00:42.980> next<00:00:43.280> thing<00:00:43.399> at

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:43.550 
that then we'll put this next thing at

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:45.369 
that then we'll put this next thing at
it<00:00:43.670> and<00:00:43.820> if<00:00:44.120> you<00:00:44.239> achieve<00:00:44.510> that<00:00:44.719> eventually

00:00:45.369 --> 00:00:45.379 
it and if you achieve that eventually

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:47.200 
it and if you achieve that eventually
you'll<00:00:45.530> get<00:00:45.710> up<00:00:45.800> to<00:00:45.920> what<00:00:46.070> I<00:00:46.100> can<00:00:46.339> do<00:00:46.460> but<00:00:47.149> I

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:47.210 
you'll get up to what I can do but I

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:48.939 
you'll get up to what I can do but I
didn't<00:00:47.510> start<00:00:47.719> there<00:00:47.960> so<00:00:48.140> I<00:00:48.440> think<00:00:48.559> trying<00:00:48.859> to

00:00:48.939 --> 00:00:48.949 
didn't start there so I think trying to

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:50.889 
didn't start there so I think trying to
expect<00:00:49.339> people<00:00:49.460> to<00:00:49.670> start<00:00:50.120> with<00:00:50.449> what<00:00:50.629> you<00:00:50.749> can

00:00:50.889 --> 00:00:50.899 
expect people to start with what you can

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:53.799 
expect people to start with what you can
do<00:00:51.050> as<00:00:51.829> ridiculous<00:00:52.399> and<00:00:52.640> and<00:00:53.239> I<00:00:53.510> think<00:00:53.719> you're

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:53.809 
do as ridiculous and and I think you're

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:54.939 
do as ridiculous and and I think you're
setting<00:00:54.079> a<00:00:54.140> student<00:00:54.409> up<00:00:54.469> for<00:00:54.620> failure

00:00:54.939 --> 00:00:54.949 
setting a student up for failure

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:57.430 
setting a student up for failure
if<00:00:55.429> you<00:00:55.640> start<00:00:55.879> with<00:00:55.969> some<00:00:56.179> 18<00:00:57.170> straight

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:57.440 
if you start with some 18 straight

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.380 
if you start with some 18 straight
combination<00:00:58.039> you<00:00:58.609> know<00:00:58.730> or<00:00:58.850> some<00:00:59.030> fancy

00:00:59.380 --> 00:00:59.390 
combination you know or some fancy

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:01.689 
combination you know or some fancy
flying<00:00:59.749> armbar<00:01:00.710> and<00:01:00.920> they've<00:01:01.309> never<00:01:01.489> done

00:01:01.689 --> 00:01:01.699 
flying armbar and they've never done

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:03.729 
flying armbar and they've never done
anything<00:01:01.969> like<00:01:02.120> that<00:01:02.239> before<00:01:02.390> I<00:01:02.929> think<00:01:03.559> that's

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:03.739 
anything like that before I think that's

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:07.719 
anything like that before I think that's
uh<00:01:03.829> I<00:01:04.330> think<00:01:05.330> that's<00:01:05.570> ego<00:01:05.780> based<00:01:06.050> I<00:01:06.580> truly<00:01:07.580> do<00:01:07.670> I

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:07.729 
uh I think that's ego based I truly do I

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:09.460 
uh I think that's ego based I truly do I
think<00:01:07.909> it's<00:01:08.000> ego<00:01:08.210> based<00:01:08.450> you<00:01:09.020> know<00:01:09.110> but<00:01:09.260> if<00:01:09.350> you

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:09.470 
think it's ego based you know but if you

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:11.620 
think it's ego based you know but if you
say<00:01:09.650> if<00:01:10.220> you<00:01:10.430> show<00:01:10.729> them<00:01:10.880> something<00:01:11.150> like<00:01:11.300> that

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:11.630 
say if you show them something like that

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:13.450 
say if you show them something like that
and<00:01:11.930> then<00:01:12.050> say<00:01:12.200> okay<00:01:12.560> this<00:01:12.770> is<00:01:12.830> what<00:01:13.160> you<00:01:13.310> can

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:13.460 
and then say okay this is what you can

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:15.760 
and then say okay this is what you can
do<00:01:13.580> in<00:01:13.700> the<00:01:13.790> art<00:01:14.000> now<00:01:14.870> let's<00:01:15.410> show<00:01:15.500> you<00:01:15.560> what

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:15.770 
do in the art now let's show you what

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:19.030 
do in the art now let's show you what
you<00:01:15.890> can<00:01:16.040> do<00:01:16.160> today<00:01:16.390> to<00:01:17.390> get<00:01:17.570> to<00:01:17.690> that<00:01:17.870> I<00:01:18.110> think

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:19.040 
you can do today to get to that I think

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:20.020 
you can do today to get to that I think
that's<00:01:19.190> important<00:01:19.580> I<00:01:19.610> think<00:01:19.730> as<00:01:19.820> part<00:01:20.000> of

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.030 
that's important I think as part of

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.180 
that's important I think as part of
being<00:01:20.240> a<00:01:20.300> good<00:01:20.450> teacher<00:01:20.600> connecting<00:01:21.560> and<00:01:21.710> with

a kid just like everybody in general has

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:23.210 
a kid just like everybody in general has
some<00:03:21.420> element<00:03:21.870> of<00:03:21.959> self-consciousness<00:03:22.650> and

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
some element of self-consciousness and

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.070 
some element of self-consciousness and
self-doubt<00:03:23.760> you<00:03:24.090> know<00:03:24.480> they<00:03:24.690> can't<00:03:24.930> do

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:25.080 
self-doubt you know they can't do

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:28.550 
self-doubt you know they can't do
something<00:03:25.489> he<00:03:26.489> never<00:03:26.730> made<00:03:27.330> me<00:03:27.510> feel<00:03:27.750> like<00:03:28.410> I

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
something he never made me feel like I

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.110 
something he never made me feel like I
like<00:03:29.250> I<00:03:29.370> couldn't<00:03:29.700> do<00:03:29.850> it

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
like I couldn't do it

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:31.970 
like I couldn't do it
he<00:03:30.540> always<00:03:30.750> knew<00:03:31.110> I<00:03:31.140> could<00:03:31.440> do<00:03:31.560> it<00:03:31.590> and<00:03:31.830> I

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
he always knew I could do it and I

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.340 
he always knew I could do it and I
figure<00:03:32.340> it<00:03:32.400> as<00:03:32.519> a<00:03:32.549> kid<00:03:32.850> well<00:03:33.150> he's<00:03:33.959> the<00:03:34.140> expert

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
figure it as a kid well he's the expert

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:36.949 
figure it as a kid well he's the expert
and<00:03:34.850> therefore<00:03:35.850> he<00:03:36.030> would<00:03:36.120> recognize<00:03:36.360> people

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
and therefore he would recognize people

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:39.500 
and therefore he would recognize people
that<00:03:37.080> can<00:03:37.170> do<00:03:37.260> it<00:03:37.380> and<00:03:37.530> can't<00:03:37.680> do<00:03:37.830> it<00:03:37.950> and<00:03:38.330> if<00:03:39.330> he

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
that can do it and can't do it and if he

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.930 
that can do it and can't do it and if he
had<00:03:39.660> that<00:03:39.780> belief<00:03:40.110> in<00:03:40.260> me<00:03:40.410> well<00:03:40.980> then<00:03:41.160> maybe<00:03:41.790> I

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
had that belief in me well then maybe I

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.510 
had that belief in me well then maybe I
can<00:03:42.150> do<00:03:42.300> it<00:03:42.560> but<00:03:43.560> if<00:03:43.650> the<00:03:43.709> expert<00:03:44.130> doesn't

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:44.520 
can do it but if the expert doesn't

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:45.830 
can do it but if the expert doesn't
believe<00:03:44.760> I<00:03:44.850> can<00:03:45.030> do<00:03:45.150> it<00:03:45.180> why<00:03:45.540> would<00:03:45.720> I<00:03:45.780> believe

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
believe I can do it why would I believe

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.540 
believe I can do it why would I believe
I<00:03:46.170> can<00:03:46.350> do<00:03:46.440> it<00:03:46.590> you<00:03:47.160> know
