00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
sort of like the WWE people do with the

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.719 
sort of like the WWE people do with the
million<00:01:19.409> dollars<00:01:19.710> at<00:01:19.860> the<00:01:19.950> top<00:01:20.159> with<00:01:20.460> they

million dollars at the top with they

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:21.800 
million dollars at the top with they
have<00:01:20.820> a<00:01:20.850> single<00:01:21.150> ladder<00:01:21.330> to<00:01:21.450> get<00:01:21.570> there

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
have a single ladder to get there

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.380 
have a single ladder to get there
they're<00:01:22.049> killing<00:01:22.380> each<00:01:22.470> other<00:01:22.619> stuff<00:01:23.390> anyways

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
they're killing each other stuff anyways

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.490 
they're killing each other stuff anyways
so<00:01:25.049> I<00:01:26.479> held<00:01:27.479> off<00:01:27.659> on<00:01:27.720> it<00:01:28.049> because<00:01:28.200> a<00:01:28.259> few<00:01:28.439> people

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
so I held off on it because a few people

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.200 
so I held off on it because a few people
said<00:01:28.890> and<00:01:29.070> I<00:01:29.310> guess<00:01:29.520> that<00:01:29.729> could<00:01:29.850> work<00:01:29.880> but<00:01:30.060> it

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
said and I guess that could work but it

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.940 
said and I guess that could work but it
wouldn't<00:01:30.390> be<00:01:30.450> too<00:01:30.630> interesting<00:01:31.140> then<00:01:31.650> I<00:01:31.680> go<00:01:31.860> on

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
wouldn't be too interesting then I go on

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.560 
wouldn't be too interesting then I go on

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
idea I did yeah so I just think it's a

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.310 
idea I did yeah so I just think it's a
good<00:01:44.670> idea<00:01:44.790> so<00:01:45.060> i<00:01:45.119> remade<00:01:45.450> it<00:01:45.630> on<00:01:45.750> xbox<00:01:45.990> and

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
good idea so i remade it on xbox and

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:47.600 
good idea so i remade it on xbox and
stuff<00:01:46.530> because<00:01:46.680> they<00:01:46.860> had<00:01:47.009> a<00:01:47.040> good<00:01:47.220> design

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
stuff because they had a good design

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.999 
stuff because they had a good design
going<00:01:47.970> for<00:01:48.240> it<00:01:48.380> whereas<00:01:49.380> I<00:01:49.470> was<00:01:49.619> stuck<00:01:49.799> at<00:01:49.920> the

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
going for it whereas I was stuck at the

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.399 
going for it whereas I was stuck at the
just<00:01:50.220> how<00:01:50.579> you<00:01:50.970> know<00:01:51.090> you<00:01:51.149> get<00:01:51.420> everything<00:01:51.630> so
