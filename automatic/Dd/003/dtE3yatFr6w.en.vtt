 laguna sister who is unemployed and 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:21.620

 bad hair I'm not bad 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:38.010
 you see it's just that you 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:41.040
 get mad at stopping a bit then 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:43.380
 always unemployed would be yes and then 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.180
 what can it do for you 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.769
 relax, I took two days of 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:50.840
 rest to spend some time with 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:55.650
 you're sorry, but it's dead 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:57.510
 sorry surprise the reaction of dresses etc 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.980
 to my surprise it is rare that she speaks 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.810
 like that his sister 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:03.030
 I do not understand why she did not 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.600
 could spend two days with me she is 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:04.920
 Unemployed 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:07.890
 they stay at home every day 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.989
 to do anything she deserves all of this 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:12.600
 anyway she annoys me it's not my 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:14.610
 fault that it was happening when I 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:16.769
 was not there she went bad hair 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:18.390
 a ben I do not know at all what is 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:20.340
 usually she is super happy 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:22.560
 and here I have the impression that she is 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.630
 angry to see you pass the pressure that 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.959
 I got so good I'll go to him 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:26.489
 speak 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:28.290
 yes I think it's the best 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:30.819
 solution 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:32.109
 while the threat ready to discuss 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:34.420
 with her sister she will make a 

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:35.680
 discovery and not least what is it 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:38.140
 who will not recover 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:40.390

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:41.079

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:43.480
 research 

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:55.680

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:59.200

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:01.600

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:03.400
 that I leave you when I saw this 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:05.920

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:07.420

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:19.780
 surprising but what are they 

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:25.090
