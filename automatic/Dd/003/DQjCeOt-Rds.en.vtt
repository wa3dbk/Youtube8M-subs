many drivers are under the impression

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:08.930 
many drivers are under the impression
that<00:00:07.319> if<00:00:07.770> the<00:00:07.919> sign<00:00:08.160> says<00:00:08.490> that<00:00:08.670> this<00:00:08.760> is<00:00:08.910> a

maximum speed limit that you can drive
with<00:00:11.040> that<00:00:11.190> speed<00:00:11.429> under<00:00:11.610> all<00:00:11.700> conditions<00:00:11.849> and

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
with that speed under all conditions and

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.209 
with that speed under all conditions and
it's<00:00:12.990> just<00:00:13.230> the<00:00:13.320> opposite<00:00:13.679> that's<00:00:13.980> the

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
it's just the opposite that's the

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:15.860 
it's just the opposite that's the
fastest<00:00:14.820> or<00:00:14.910> that's<00:00:15.089> the<00:00:15.210> maximum<00:00:15.630> speed<00:00:15.839> that

fastest or that's the maximum speed that

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.510 
fastest or that's the maximum speed that
you<00:00:16.080> can<00:00:16.109> travel<00:00:16.440> under<00:00:16.710> ideal<00:00:17.250> driving

dangerous for us but when it's raining
it's<00:00:50.460> just<00:00:50.670> raining<00:00:50.910> and<00:00:51.500> drivers<00:00:52.500> don't

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
it's just raining and drivers don't

attraction the control that they have is

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.260 
attraction the control that they have is
going<00:00:58.500> to<00:00:58.620> be<00:00:58.859> greatly<00:00:59.190> diminished<00:00:59.489> because

can you not see now the road is slippery
and<00:01:05.820> people<00:01:06.720> are<00:01:06.810> driving<00:01:07.049> like<00:01:07.439> it's<00:01:07.590> a

got to take so many things into into
consideration<00:01:13.110> you've<00:01:13.560> got<00:01:13.770> to<00:01:13.920> keep<00:01:14.100> that

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
consideration you've got to keep that

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.570 
consideration you've got to keep that
distance<00:01:14.780> you've<00:01:15.780> got<00:01:15.990> to<00:01:16.140> slow<00:01:16.409> down<00:01:16.439> and<00:01:17.009> you

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
distance you've got to slow down and you

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.789

can't make sudden moves with the car

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:20.840 
can't make sudden moves with the car
because<00:01:20.189> you're<00:01:20.310> going<00:01:20.430> to<00:01:20.490> spin<00:01:20.700> out<00:01:20.820> of

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
because you're going to spin out of

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:21.530 
because you're going to spin out of
control

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
control

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.800 
control
if<00:01:22.200> you<00:01:22.350> take<00:01:22.530> a<00:01:22.560> look<00:01:22.710> at<00:01:22.890> any<00:01:23.040> intersection

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810 
if you take a look at any intersection

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.410 
if you take a look at any intersection
it's<00:01:25.310> where<00:01:26.310> you're<00:01:26.490> going<00:01:26.729> to<00:01:26.820> have<00:01:26.939> a<00:01:27.119> lot<00:01:27.390> of

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
it's where you're going to have a lot of

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.649 
it's where you're going to have a lot of
oil<00:01:27.810> deposits<00:01:28.560> on<00:01:28.710> the<00:01:29.220> road<00:01:29.430> and<00:01:29.729> when<00:01:30.540> it

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
oil deposits on the road and when it

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:34.399 
oil deposits on the road and when it
starts<00:01:30.960> to<00:01:31.049> rain<00:01:31.430> the<00:01:32.430> water<00:01:32.750> is<00:01:33.750> heavier<00:01:34.229> than

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
starts to rain the water is heavier than

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.140 
starts to rain the water is heavier than
the<00:01:34.470> oil<00:01:34.710> so<00:01:35.189> the<00:01:35.310> oil<00:01:35.400> is<00:01:35.640> going<00:01:35.759> to<00:01:35.820> float<00:01:36.030> up

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.469 
the oil so the oil is going to float up
to<00:01:36.180> the<00:01:36.360> top<00:01:36.479> and<00:01:36.960> a<00:01:37.740> driver<00:01:38.640> now<00:01:38.909> coming<00:01:39.270> into

what's on the other side so there's two

and<00:03:57.610> give<00:03:58.360> yourself<00:03:59.020> to<00:03:59.200> curiosity<00:04:00.160> to<00:04:00.490> ask

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:00.520 
and give yourself to curiosity to ask

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:03.210 
and give yourself to curiosity to ask
what's<00:04:01.450> on<00:04:01.600> the<00:04:01.720> other<00:04:01.750> side<00:04:01.960> rather<00:04:02.920> than

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:03.220 
what's on the other side rather than

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:04.830 
what's on the other side rather than
assume<00:04:03.490> it's<00:04:03.700> going<00:04:03.820> to<00:04:03.880> be<00:04:03.970> okay<00:04:04.270> and<00:04:04.540> if

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:04.840 
assume it's going to be okay and if

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:06.090 
assume it's going to be okay and if
we're<00:04:04.990> asking<00:04:05.140> ourselves<00:04:05.500> the<00:04:05.950> right

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:06.100 
we're asking ourselves the right

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:07.230 
we're asking ourselves the right
question<00:04:06.520> we're<00:04:06.820> going<00:04:06.910> to<00:04:07.000> see<00:04:07.120> the

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:07.240 
question we're going to see the

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:09.720 
question we're going to see the
information<00:04:07.720> a<00:04:07.810> lot<00:04:07.930> sooner<00:04:08.280> when<00:04:09.280> something

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:09.730 
information a lot sooner when something

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:12.630 
information a lot sooner when something
occurs<00:04:10.060> in<00:04:10.270> front<00:04:10.540> of<00:04:10.690> you<00:04:11.070> you<00:04:12.070> want<00:04:12.250> to<00:04:12.400> have

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:12.640 
occurs in front of you you want to have

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:14.580 
occurs in front of you you want to have
some<00:04:12.910> other<00:04:13.180> option<00:04:13.720> available<00:04:13.840> besides

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:14.590 
some other option available besides

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:18.960 
some other option available besides
slamming<00:04:15.100> on<00:04:15.250> the<00:04:15.370> brakes<00:04:15.610> so<00:04:17.400> once<00:04:18.400> a<00:04:18.580> person

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:18.970 
slamming on the brakes so once a person

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:21.150 
slamming on the brakes so once a person
identifies<00:04:19.450> a<00:04:19.660> potential<00:04:20.140> hazard<00:04:20.320> there's

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:21.160 
identifies a potential hazard there's

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.820 
identifies a potential hazard there's
basically<00:04:21.520> four<00:04:21.850> options<00:04:22.420> they<00:04:23.230> have<00:04:23.470> to

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:23.830 
basically four options they have to

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:27.660 
basically four options they have to
avoid<00:04:24.250> a<00:04:24.520> collision<00:04:25.320> one<00:04:26.320> would<00:04:27.010> be<00:04:27.160> the

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:27.670 
avoid a collision one would be the

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:29.880 
avoid a collision one would be the
brakes<00:04:28.230> another<00:04:29.230> one<00:04:29.380> would<00:04:29.530> be<00:04:29.560> steering

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:29.890 
brakes another one would be steering

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:33.170 
brakes another one would be steering
either<00:04:30.130> to<00:04:30.310> the<00:04:30.400> left<00:04:31.200> or<00:04:32.200> to<00:04:32.260> the<00:04:32.560> right<00:04:32.650> and

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:33.180 
either to the left or to the right and

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:35.310 
either to the left or to the right and
then<00:04:34.180> a<00:04:34.210> fourth<00:04:34.450> option<00:04:34.570> would<00:04:34.810> be<00:04:34.870> to<00:04:34.990> speed

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:35.320 
then a fourth option would be to speed

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:39.890 
then a fourth option would be to speed
up

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:39.900 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:41.600 

so<00:04:40.440> they<00:04:40.590> need<00:04:40.740> to<00:04:40.770> start<00:04:41.070> thinking<00:04:41.130> about

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:41.610 
so they need to start thinking about

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:43.930 
so they need to start thinking about
well<00:04:42.030> what<00:04:42.360> can<00:04:42.630> I<00:04:42.870> do

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:43.940 
well what can I do

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:46.640 
well what can I do
beside<00:04:44.940> slamming<00:04:45.390> on<00:04:45.510> the<00:04:45.630> brakes<00:04:45.870> a<00:04:46.200> lot<00:04:46.530> of

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:46.650 
beside slamming on the brakes a lot of

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:48.850 
beside slamming on the brakes a lot of
times<00:04:46.890> steering<00:04:47.520> out<00:04:47.670> of<00:04:47.820> the<00:04:47.910> way

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:48.860 
times steering out of the way

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:51.190 
times steering out of the way
steering<00:04:49.860> up<00:04:49.980> on<00:04:50.130> the<00:04:50.250> shoulder<00:04:50.640> of<00:04:50.730> the<00:04:50.790> road

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:51.200 
steering up on the shoulder of the road

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:53.780 
steering up on the shoulder of the road
maybe<00:04:52.200> hitting<00:04:52.620> a<00:04:52.710> paddle<00:04:53.130> marker<00:04:53.520> or<00:04:53.730> a

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:53.790 
maybe hitting a paddle marker or a

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:55.640 
maybe hitting a paddle marker or a
guardrail<00:04:54.540> rather<00:04:54.870> than<00:04:55.140> rear-ending

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:55.650 
guardrail rather than rear-ending

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:58.100 
guardrail rather than rear-ending
another<00:04:55.920> car<00:04:56.220> I<00:04:56.520> know<00:04:57.030> the<00:04:57.210> options<00:04:57.750> that<00:04:57.870> are

00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:58.110 
another car I know the options that are

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:00.710 
another car I know the options that are
available<00:04:58.400> if<00:04:59.400> we<00:04:59.670> would<00:05:00.000> think<00:05:00.180> about<00:05:00.360> ahead

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:00.720 
available if we would think about ahead

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:02.990 
available if we would think about ahead
of<00:05:00.810> time
