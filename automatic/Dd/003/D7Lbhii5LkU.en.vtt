um<00:00:14.519> described<00:00:15.269> that<00:00:15.450> you<00:00:15.630> can<00:00:15.839> vanish<00:00:16.049> while

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
um described that you can vanish while

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.560 
um described that you can vanish while
blocking<00:00:16.619> but<00:00:17.070> it<00:00:17.160> didn't<00:00:17.460> quite<00:00:17.670> give<00:00:18.300> you<00:00:18.539> a

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
blocking but it didn't quite give you a

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
that you can do that but you can vanish

vanishing mid combo a lot of times if

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.940 
vanishing mid combo a lot of times if
you<00:00:44.879> do<00:00:45.030> a<00:00:45.059> combo<00:00:45.539> and<00:00:45.750> your<00:00:46.469> opponent<00:00:46.649> is

you do a combo and your opponent is
blocking<00:00:47.460> they<00:00:47.850> have<00:00:48.090> what<00:00:48.390> is<00:00:48.480> called

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
blocking they have what is called

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.090 
blocking they have what is called
advantage<00:00:49.079> frames<00:00:49.289> over<00:00:49.559> you<00:00:49.649> which<00:00:49.890> means

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
advantage frames over you which means

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.369 
advantage frames over you which means

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
they can pop off an attack before you

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:53.930 
they can pop off an attack before you
can<00:00:52.739> get<00:00:52.920> back<00:00:53.129> to<00:00:53.280> your<00:00:53.399> resting<00:00:53.789> position

can get back to your resting position
and<00:00:54.449> pop<00:00:54.690> a<00:00:54.719> guard<00:00:55.050> or<00:00:55.260> an<00:00:55.410> attack<00:00:55.680> and<00:00:55.920> this

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
and pop a guard or an attack and this

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:57.950 
and pop a guard or an attack and this
will<00:00:56.760> end<00:00:56.879> up<00:00:57.000> happening<00:00:57.030> and<00:00:57.480> it's<00:00:57.780> always

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
will end up happening and it's always

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.520 
will end up happening and it's always
painful<00:00:58.199> um<00:00:59.180> so<00:01:00.180> there<00:01:00.660> are<00:01:00.809> ways<00:01:00.870> around<00:01:01.050> it

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
painful um so there are ways around it

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.759 
painful um so there are ways around it
um<00:01:01.940> usually<00:01:02.940> what<00:01:03.510> you<00:01:03.660> should<00:01:03.899> do<00:01:04.110> midway

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
um usually what you should do midway

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.609 
um usually what you should do midway
through<00:01:04.799> your<00:01:05.159> combo<00:01:05.519> is<00:01:05.810> vanish<00:01:06.810> if<00:01:07.080> your

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
through your combo is vanish if your

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.380 
through your combo is vanish if your
opponent<00:01:07.860> is<00:01:08.070> blocking<00:01:08.549> that<00:01:08.729> way<00:01:08.939> you'll<00:01:09.210> get

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
opponent is blocking that way you'll get

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:10.940 
opponent is blocking that way you'll get
their<00:01:09.630> back<00:01:09.810> and<00:01:10.080> if<00:01:10.200> they<00:01:10.320> aren't<00:01:10.560> prepared

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
their back and if they aren't prepared

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.100 
their back and if they aren't prepared
for<00:01:11.220> you<00:01:11.340> you<00:01:11.520> can<00:01:11.909> continue<00:01:12.570> dealing<00:01:12.780> damage

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
for you you can continue dealing damage

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.870 
for you you can continue dealing damage
or<00:01:13.470> you<00:01:13.619> can<00:01:13.770> throw<00:01:13.920> in<00:01:14.040> a<00:01:14.100> super<00:01:14.460> or<00:01:14.640> you<00:01:14.729> can

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
or you can throw in a super or you can

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.010 
or you can throw in a super or you can
do<00:01:14.970> whatever<00:01:15.119> you<00:01:15.299> like<00:01:15.330> you<00:01:15.570> can<00:01:15.720> move<00:01:15.840> away

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
do whatever you like you can move away

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.960 
do whatever you like you can move away
and<00:01:16.200> regroup<00:01:16.650> whatever<00:01:17.280> you<00:01:17.430> want<00:01:17.610> to<00:01:17.670> do<00:01:17.759> I'm

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
and regroup whatever you want to do I'm

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.480 
and regroup whatever you want to do I'm
doing<00:01:18.960> this<00:01:19.110> does<00:01:19.350> take<00:01:19.590> two<00:01:19.799> bars<00:01:19.979> of<00:01:20.100> stamina

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
doing this does take two bars of stamina

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.899 
doing this does take two bars of stamina
though<00:01:20.600> so<00:01:21.600> um<00:01:22.070> it's<00:01:23.070> very<00:01:23.400> important<00:01:23.880> that

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
though so um it's very important that

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.580 
though so um it's very important that
you<00:01:24.060> pick<00:01:24.330> your<00:01:24.479> spot<00:01:24.720> on<00:01:24.869> this<00:01:25.020> but<00:01:25.259> if<00:01:25.409> you're

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
you pick your spot on this but if you're

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:26.870 
you pick your spot on this but if you're
dealing<00:01:25.770> with<00:01:25.979> a<00:01:26.070> blocking<00:01:26.460> opponent

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
dealing with a blocking opponent

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.819 
dealing with a blocking opponent
grabbing<00:01:27.509> isn't<00:01:27.780> always<00:01:27.900> the<00:01:28.080> only<00:01:28.470> way<00:01:28.590> you

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
grabbing isn't always the only way you

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.499 
grabbing isn't always the only way you
can't<00:01:29.040> just<00:01:29.220> grab<00:01:29.430> in<00:01:29.700> the<00:01:29.850> middle<00:01:29.880> of<00:01:30.090> a<00:01:30.180> combo

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
can't just grab in the middle of a combo

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:31.600 
can't just grab in the middle of a combo
and<00:01:30.630> if<00:01:30.720> your<00:01:30.810> opponent's<00:01:31.140> good<00:01:31.259> at<00:01:31.350> grabbing

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:31.610 
and if your opponent's good at grabbing

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:36.109 
and if your opponent's good at grabbing
you'll<00:01:32.610> be<00:01:32.729> done<00:01:34.130> so<00:01:35.130> you<00:01:35.220> need<00:01:35.759> to<00:01:35.909> make<00:01:36.060> sure

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
you'll be done so you need to make sure

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.390 
you'll be done so you need to make sure
that<00:01:36.570> you<00:01:36.720> pay<00:01:37.590> attention<00:01:37.710> to<00:01:38.130> what<00:01:38.250> your

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400

this in mind a lot of people don't
vanish<00:02:39.300> as<00:02:39.900> you<00:02:39.989> can<00:02:40.140> see<00:02:40.290> here<00:02:40.500> I<00:02:40.620> just<00:02:40.950> pretty

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
vanish as you can see here I just pretty

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.030 
vanish as you can see here I just pretty
much<00:02:41.340> block<00:02:41.730> vanish<00:02:42.090> the<00:02:42.270> the<00:02:42.840> gravity<00:02:43.739> impact

much block vanish the the gravity impact

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.130 
much block vanish the the gravity impact
you<00:02:44.700> know<00:02:44.790> how<00:02:44.880> useful<00:02:45.120> that<00:02:45.300> is<00:02:45.510> a<00:02:45.690> lot<00:02:46.080> of

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
you know how useful that is a lot of

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.050 
you know how useful that is a lot of
people<00:02:46.410> don't<00:02:46.709> block<00:02:46.980> vanish<00:02:47.370> and<00:02:47.550> because

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
people don't block vanish and because

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.960 
people don't block vanish and because
they<00:02:48.180> don't<00:02:48.420> um<00:02:49.190> they<00:02:50.190> miss<00:02:50.430> out<00:02:50.610> on<00:02:50.850> these

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
they don't um they miss out on these

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.790 
they don't um they miss out on these
opportunities<00:02:51.570> especially<00:02:52.290> if<00:02:52.560> you're<00:02:52.680> not

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
opportunities especially if you're not

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.500 
opportunities especially if you're not
blocking<00:02:53.100> so<00:02:53.400> if<00:02:53.489> you<00:02:53.640> don't<00:02:54.000> like<00:02:54.150> to<00:02:54.300> block

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
blocking so if you don't like to block

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:55.940 
blocking so if you don't like to block
in<00:02:54.630> this<00:02:54.720> game<00:02:54.959> this<00:02:55.530> is<00:02:55.709> definitely

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
in this game this is definitely

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
this myself to get around ill flash in

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:03.740 
this myself to get around ill flash in
certain<00:03:02.400> moves<00:03:02.580> that<00:03:02.880> I<00:03:02.910> just<00:03:03.269> cannot<00:03:03.510> stand

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
certain moves that I just cannot stand

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.979 
certain moves that I just cannot stand
um<00:03:03.989> but<00:03:04.680> I<00:03:04.830> promise<00:03:05.310> you<00:03:05.340> if<00:03:05.670> you<00:03:05.700> block<00:03:06.570> vanish

um but I promise you if you block vanish

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:09.440 
um but I promise you if you block vanish

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
and you cancel your combos with a vanish

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.600 
and you cancel your combos with a vanish
while<00:03:10.140> your<00:03:10.290> opponent<00:03:10.650> is<00:03:10.709> blocking<00:03:11.100> it'll

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
while your opponent is blocking it'll

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:13.400 
while your opponent is blocking it'll
definitely<00:03:11.880> step<00:03:12.300> up<00:03:12.450> your<00:03:12.570> game<00:03:12.630> and<00:03:13.050> you'll
