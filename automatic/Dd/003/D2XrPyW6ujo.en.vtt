 was that they gave the son of an owner of 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:13.080
 gasoline and waterfront workshop 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.540
 bruce mclaren grew up surrounded by cars 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.850
 At 22 years old, McLaren became the pilot. 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.859
 younger to win a grand prize 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.380
 his racing team would become 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.689
 one of the most successful in history. 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.599
 bruce mclaren's motto was nothing 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.400
 this philosophy would extend to 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:32.219
 mclaren production team 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.770
 obsessed with perfection and quality 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:37.260
 clear and technologist of 60 raises even more 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.360
 the famous attention to the details of the company 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.250
 each room in the building is constructed of 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.160
 specialized form for 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.920
 car fanatics even cafeteria 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.200
 is specially designed to have a 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.500
 lower air pressure so smells 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.629
 do not leave the area in 1992 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.149
 they produced the most 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:00.570
 fast and state-of-the-art 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:02.480
 time the legendary mclaren f1 ever since 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.250
 his untiring quest for excellence 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:08.000
 It took up leadership among manufacturers 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.000
 supercars 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.020
 st 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:58.630
 interest is zero and 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:10.970
 Do you speak people who did not speak in luiz? 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:14.209
 Welcome to another video 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:16.220
 of strength to 5 and today's video staff 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:18.800
 and I bring it to you in a kind of 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.480
 new series for the channel will be a video 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.400
 pilot let's say so 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:25.220
 If you approve, we will give 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:27.650
 continuity and make more videos in 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:30.019
 style in case you do not prove we're going 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:32.450
 End this one right here and we'll give 

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:33.769
 sequence and channel videos 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:36.140
 but I confess to you that I'm fine 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:37.250
 excited and I think you'll like it 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.340
 even more that you liked it a lot 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.690
 of the prayer force series and I think 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:43.970
 if it was not for you, so will you 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:46.790
 enjoy because besides I bring games 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:48.380
 with single cars let's say so 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:50.860
 I 'm always going to bring it to 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:54.709
 you the technical specifications of each 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:57.620
 car and determined the car and you are 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:59.390
 bringing the story of the automaker in the case 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.700
 of today's video you could check out 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:04.630
 the history of mclaren and also the 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:07.280
 mclaren mp4 technical specifications 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:09.049
 c12 the one I'm playing 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.120
 For now it 's the only mclaren I 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:13.579
 I have in the game but as long as I get 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:17.030
 new cars more powerful or cars 

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:19.310
 the more bombastic the cars evolved 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:21.350
 the crowd has that ostentation that 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:23.959
 he only has to sometimes end up not having 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:25.700
 because of the money but in the game force 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:27.350
 so we can manage to have 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:28.910
 these cars to simplify what I 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:32.030
 I never got to buy in my life. 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:33.889
 but he does not force himself to have the car 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:36.350
 I can play it I can actually see 

00:03:33.889 --> 00:03:39.049
 how does the car work due to 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:40.670
 exceptional quality forsa 5 nor 

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:43.010
 another game you can see one 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:45.769
 interior quality of the car so perfect 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:48.109
 how is this then is basically as if 

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:50.150
 really had the car had 

00:03:48.109 --> 00:03:52.519
 playing with the car you can too 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:57.170
 use force to get into the car 

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:59.239
 see all details ignition exchange 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:00.829
 You can also see the car engine. 

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:03.769
 finally you can see 

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:05.690
 basically everything giving you the feeling of 

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:06.110
 really being around the car is 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:08.690
 with 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:11.420
 being this, I found it very cool then 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:13.310
 idea of today's video of this video 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:14.780
 series will basically be what bring the 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:17.570
 history of the automaker for you 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:19.670
 for each car and also the 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:21.590
 car technical specifications and 

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:25.030
 also of my opinion about what I 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:27.800
 i found that car relation and mclaren mp4 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:30.230
 c12 I found a super good car well 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:32.060
 nice inside of him, it's really cool you 

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:34.520
 can see that the steering wheel is 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:36.020
 digital is a unique digital seems 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:37.520
 those cars of formula 1 the old one that 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:39.169
 has a single digital is up to 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:41.630
 Sometimes printing is a bike with the 

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:43.040
 single digital pointer at last is a 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:44.750
 Very cool system , I will not say much 

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:46.430
 Details will leave you more 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:49.190
 looking and I'm going to tell you about my experience 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:51.350
 for this car 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:55.940
 I particularly liked him 

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:58.250
 accelerates well has a one at the end of 

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:59.000
 very interesting selection he is good at 

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:01.190
 curve 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.710
 only he has two small problems 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:06.080
 let's say it only attraction on the back 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:07.220
 this means that when you went 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:09.169
 accelerate you have to take a lot 

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:10.729
 be careful not to throttle the 

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:12.919
 very accurate accelerate a car will be 

00:05:10.729 --> 00:05:15.229
 a lot of back and then you can not 

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:17.030
 have traction when leaving a curve 

00:05:15.229 --> 00:05:19.820
 accelerated the car always gives that 

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:21.919
 boys that you waste a lot of time is 

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:24.050
 trying to stabilize the car 

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:26.419
 another point I also did not like 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:29.000
 much in relation to the times there is wear and tear 

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:30.950
 I feel the wear of 

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.080
 wait a little longer than in others 

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:35.270
 four-wheel-drive cars or 

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:37.160
 Drift at the front I'll say it 

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:39.350
 for you are even stranger but 

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:41.840
 tire wear like that 

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:44.120
 People, I 'm playing the game on the way. 

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:46.460
 simulator that leaves the game much more 

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:49.280
 both tire wear and 

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:51.110
 beats in this race is basically not 

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:52.940
 hit very hard nobody, nothing then 

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:55.100
 no harm happened 

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:58.280
 but in the next races with certainty 

00:05:55.100 --> 00:06:02.270
 you will see the damage to the beats in 

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:05.180
 But then you'll end up with 

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:08.090
 to grant the damage of both suspension of 

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:11.419
 motor loss of the car at last 

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:13.550
 ends up having enough of the vehicle and 

00:06:11.419 --> 00:06:16.610
 especially the tires then in that case 

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:17.920
 here mclaren mp4 ends up not enjoying 

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:21.190
 very 

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:23.140
 the curve exit of it ends up leaving very 

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:26.110
 and also in the field of tires that the 

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:27.820
 tire wear is very high and the 

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:29.560
 issue of the turnout that ended 

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:31.990
 not holding is because the following also 

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:34.930
 People I'm playing with the game with 

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:37.720
 about 40% more difficulty or 

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:40.000
 be pull is extraction assistant 

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:42.910
 frei's assistant is also 

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:45.520
 off to the scheme for you turn the 

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:47.440
 steering wheel is in normal mode is not in the 

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:50.290
 easy way to say so it ends up having 

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:52.060
 a reduced steering wheel extension 

00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:52.810
 It's not so easy for you to do the 

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:55.630
 curves 

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:57.460
 also the stripe system of the bands in the 

00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:58.180
 how they really help you in the 

00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:01.180
 curves 

00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:02.470
 anyway the game is 40% harder you 

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:04.030
 could check that I could not 

00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:05.800
 get first in this race 

00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:07.960
 arriving at the end and I did not 

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:09.640
 reaching the first place 

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:12.070
 This is because I'm playing with dri. 

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:15.400
 to vote that the artificial intelligence of 

00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:18.160
 my opponents by 35 percent or 

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:20.680
 the driving of race opponents 

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:22.420
 is in a kind of intelligence 

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:24.760
 artificial is professional 

00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:26.440
 specialist if I'm not mistaken and then 

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:27.400
 this ends up leaving the game much more 

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:28.990
 difficult 

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:30.520
 so this is it people I hope you 

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:32.350
 've enjoyed this video to you 

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:33.490
 have understood the idea of ​​the video I 

00:07:32.350 --> 00:07:35.290
 I think it's going to be very cool, this one. 

00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:37.030
 first video a little short and I 

00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:39.340
 I ended up talking half-way through the next 

00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:41.800
 trying to get into more details but 

00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:43.420
 I think the thick is this I hope 

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:45.220
 You guys have tanned so this 

00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:49.380
 Thank you so much for the company and the 

00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:49.380
 People will see each other in the next video bye
