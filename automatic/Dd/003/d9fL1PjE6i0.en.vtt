00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:22.170
 Today we have two new super tanks 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.930
 test 1 will have us replace the intelligence 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:28.680

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:31.680
 sp1 c from mouth anchik premium elite 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:34.380
 m41 revolution which in Israel was called 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:36.900
 and why they call it super Sherman but we 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:40.170
 we first disassemble the panzer sp1 c 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:42.060
 This is a German seventh build and he 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.230
 as I said will replace our 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:48.000

 You guys are also looking at you 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.840

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:57.090
 I will highlight only the main details 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:00.300

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:12.300
 Yes, you take it rather developed 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:16.200
 panther already wants a drum for 720 damage 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:19.020
 it will be better than t71 but of course 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.720
 the same t71 has a little more drum 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:24.210
 Damage is 900 but lower friends 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:27.360
 penetration because we have like 1c 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:30.630

 very very ugly and from the first 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:43.510
 he looks a little short so well 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:46.269
 still, why do we need to look 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:49.450
 What kind of a tank is this already ? 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:52.690

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:55.570
 the panthers who and jow smeared that 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:57.519
 and about tanks and desertod and flashes which 

00:02:55.570 --> 00:03:00.160

 France was granted in the 50s 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:25.540
 but first of all by strengthening them 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:27.610
 firepower the result of these works 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:29.650
