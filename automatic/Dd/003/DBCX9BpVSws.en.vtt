Cockatoo shows off

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:31.900
The parrot sitting on my arm,

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:34.900
which you have just seen showing off,

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:37.100
is the  triton, a subspecies of the Sulphur-crested Cockatoo.

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.880
This breed loves being in a center of attention

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:44.980
And to attract this attention

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:49.140
they'll perform all kinds of tricks:

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.380
they can ruffle feathers, pretend to dance, make various noises,

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:58.060
behave in a strange, performative manner.

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:00.600
And the goal is one

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.120
make sure all the eyes are focused on them.

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.080

Cockatoos can talk quite well, but out of all parrots,

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:10.240
they have satisfactory, but not the best imitating skills.

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.100
They compensate it with outstanding intelligence.

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.960
And, I could say, a natural circus talent.

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.560
If you ever see a circus performance

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:21.860
with the parrot cycling, rollerblading

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:26.300
or putting some objects into right holes,

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:29.320
you may be sure it's going to be a cockatoo.
