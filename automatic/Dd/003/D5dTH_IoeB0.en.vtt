actually doing on the sexual thing but
it<00:01:47.430> actually<00:01:47.549> seems<00:01:47.880> real<00:01:48.090> beneficial<00:01:48.630> and<00:01:48.899> I

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
it actually seems real beneficial and I

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.200 
it actually seems real beneficial and I
actually<00:01:49.110> makes<00:01:49.470> a<00:01:49.590> lot<00:01:49.619> of<00:01:49.829> sense<00:01:50.009> you<00:01:51.000> look

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
actually makes a lot of sense you look

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.389 
actually makes a lot of sense you look
at<00:01:51.360> it<00:01:51.390> your<00:01:51.570> body's<00:01:51.899> always<00:01:52.399> burning

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
at it your body's always burning

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.520 
at it your body's always burning
calories<00:01:53.909> and<00:01:54.299> trying<00:01:54.479> to<00:01:54.570> burn<00:01:54.750> fat<00:01:55.110> fat<00:01:55.380> is

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
calories and trying to burn fat fat is

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.350 
calories and trying to burn fat fat is
just<00:01:55.710> energy<00:01:56.130> just<00:01:56.490> sitting<00:01:57.030> at<00:01:57.119> your<00:01:57.149> body

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
just energy just sitting at your body

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.959 
just energy just sitting at your body
stored<00:01:57.840> energy<00:01:58.490> so<00:01:59.490> if<00:01:59.549> your<00:01:59.670> body<00:01:59.850> is

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
stored energy so if your body is

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.690 
stored energy so if your body is
actually<00:02:00.090> looking<00:02:00.450> for<00:02:00.570> that<00:02:00.659> stored<00:02:00.960> energy

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700 
actually looking for that stored energy

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.459 
actually looking for that stored energy
it's<00:02:02.700> not<00:02:02.880> gonna<00:02:03.030> be<00:02:03.119> able<00:02:03.180> to<00:02:03.329> burn<00:02:03.509> the

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
it's not gonna be able to burn the

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.889 
it's not gonna be able to burn the
energy<00:02:04.829> necessary<00:02:05.149> if<00:02:06.149> all<00:02:06.420> you're<00:02:06.600> doing<00:02:06.810> is

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
energy necessary if all you're doing is

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.960 
energy necessary if all you're doing is
eating<00:02:07.140> throughout<00:02:07.439> the<00:02:07.590> day<00:02:07.710> and<00:02:08.489> constantly

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
this thing out there about six weeks and

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:21.730 
this thing out there about six weeks and
intermittent<00:02:20.990> fasting<00:02:21.320> is<00:02:21.590> real

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:21.740 
intermittent fasting is real

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:23.110 
intermittent fasting is real
straightforward<00:02:21.980> basically<00:02:22.490> what<00:02:22.880> you<00:02:22.940> wind

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
straightforward basically what you wind

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.140 
straightforward basically what you wind
up<00:02:23.210> doing<00:02:23.390> is<00:02:24.190> you<00:02:25.190> eat<00:02:25.400> only<00:02:25.670> within<00:02:25.940> a

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
up doing is you eat only within a

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:27.940 
up doing is you eat only within a
certain<00:02:26.360> timeframe<00:02:26.810> so<00:02:27.470> your<00:02:27.590> body<00:02:27.770> is

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
certain timeframe so your body is

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.850 
certain timeframe so your body is
basically<00:02:28.490> being<00:02:29.210> depleted<00:02:29.660> of<00:02:30.020> the<00:02:30.500> actual

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
basically being depleted of the actual

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:32.170 
basically being depleted of the actual
food<00:02:31.040> that<00:02:31.250> it<00:02:31.340> needs<00:02:31.460> to<00:02:31.550> process<00:02:31.760> throughout

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
food that it needs to process throughout

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.170 
food that it needs to process throughout
a<00:02:32.240> certain<00:02:32.570> time<00:02:32.720> period<00:02:33.140> and<00:02:33.290> then<00:02:33.950> only<00:02:34.760> in

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
a certain time period and then only in

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.110 
a certain time period and then only in
that<00:02:35.390> window<00:02:35.810> you<00:02:35.870> actually<00:02:36.320> so<00:02:36.620> it<00:02:36.710> could<00:02:36.800> be

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
that window you actually so it could be

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.840 
that window you actually so it could be
20<00:02:38.120> hours<00:02:38.600> you<00:02:38.930> don't<00:02:39.200> eat<00:02:39.380> four<00:02:40.250> hours<00:02:40.550> you<00:02:40.670> do

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:40.850 
20 hours you don't eat four hours you do

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:44.770 
20 hours you don't eat four hours you do
or<00:02:41.920> 18<00:02:42.920> hours<00:02:43.250> you<00:02:43.340> don't<00:02:43.610> need<00:02:43.760> six<00:02:44.330> hours<00:02:44.660> you

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
or 18 hours you don't need six hours you

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:46.990 
or 18 hours you don't need six hours you
do<00:02:44.960> or<00:02:45.200> 16<00:02:45.830> and<00:02:46.040> eight<00:02:46.220> however<00:02:46.640> you<00:02:46.760> want<00:02:46.940> to

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
do or 16 and eight however you want to

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.160 
do or 16 and eight however you want to
do<00:02:47.150> it<00:02:47.270> basically<00:02:47.600> I<00:02:47.690> think<00:02:47.900> I<00:02:47.960> was<00:02:48.050> already

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.170 
do it basically I think I was already

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:50.160 
do it basically I think I was already
doing<00:02:48.290> 16<00:02:48.860> and<00:02:49.010> eight<00:02:49.130> pretty<00:02:49.370> much<00:02:49.550> already

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
doing 16 and eight pretty much already

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:54.160 
doing 16 and eight pretty much already
so<00:02:51.170> I<00:02:51.230> do<00:02:51.550> 16<00:02:52.550> hours<00:02:52.790> and<00:02:52.910> not<00:02:52.970> eating<00:02:53.210> Oh<00:02:53.540> some

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170 
so I do 16 hours and not eating Oh some

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:55.750 
so I do 16 hours and not eating Oh some
of<00:02:54.260> that<00:02:54.380> was<00:02:54.500> actually<00:02:54.770> sleeping<00:02:54.890> or<00:02:55.400> five<00:02:55.580> to

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 
of that was actually sleeping or five to

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.940 
of that was actually sleeping or five to
six<00:02:55.940> hours<00:02:56.030> actually<00:02:56.330> get<00:02:56.570> already<00:02:56.810> and<00:02:57.770> then

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
six hours actually get already and then

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:01.300 
six hours actually get already and then
the<00:02:58.100> other<00:02:58.160> the<00:02:59.150> rest<00:02:59.330> of<00:02:59.420> the<00:02:59.510> time<00:02:59.720> was<00:03:00.310> on

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
the other the rest of the time was on

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:03.070 
the other the rest of the time was on
the<00:03:01.460> way<00:03:01.580> to<00:03:01.610> work<00:03:01.850> coming<00:03:02.360> from<00:03:02.600> work<00:03:02.870> or

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:03.080 
the way to work coming from work or

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:04.690 
the way to work coming from work or
doing<00:03:03.530> something<00:03:03.860> between<00:03:04.100> that<00:03:04.400> I<00:03:04.460> actually

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
doing something between that I actually

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.600 
doing something between that I actually
had<00:03:04.970> no<00:03:05.120> time<00:03:05.330> to<00:03:05.360> actually<00:03:05.540> eat<00:03:05.810> so<00:03:06.550> they<00:03:07.550> I'm

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:07.610 
had no time to actually eat so they I'm

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:10.120 
had no time to actually eat so they I'm
going<00:03:07.730> to<00:03:07.790> jump<00:03:08.060> it<00:03:08.210> up<00:03:08.300> and<00:03:08.570> do<00:03:08.870> it<00:03:08.900> 18<00:03:09.320> 6<00:03:09.710> how

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:10.130 
going to jump it up and do it 18 6 how

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:12.160 
going to jump it up and do it 18 6 how
to<00:03:10.190> do<00:03:10.370> it<00:03:10.490> that<00:03:10.610> way<00:03:10.760> for<00:03:10.940> a<00:03:10.970> little<00:03:11.090> bit<00:03:11.240> and

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
to do it that way for a little bit and

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:13.390 
to do it that way for a little bit and
then<00:03:12.260> eventually<00:03:12.440> probably<00:03:12.860> bump<00:03:13.160> it<00:03:13.310> up

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400 
then eventually probably bump it up

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.460 
then eventually probably bump it up
probably<00:03:14.030> around<00:03:14.090> the<00:03:14.270> 3<00:03:14.540> week<00:03:14.690> for<00:03:15.020> week<00:03:15.200> mark

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:15.470 
probably around the 3 week for week mark
