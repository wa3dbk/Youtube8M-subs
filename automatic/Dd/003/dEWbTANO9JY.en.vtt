00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.330
 one thing I wanted to say of course 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.339
 You do not want to speak my name because 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:08.670
 people do not know how to speak the name or how 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:11.969
 I used to know how to handle a disk 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:14.820
 personal calls also say right because not 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:17.910
 every day manipulate discs some 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:20.820
 days manipulate cds says controller 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.830
 other pen drive 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.820
 each one chooses the way of these I 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:29.010
 I prefer vinyl, I still prefer to keep 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.519
 roots of his day's culture that is 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.519
 vinyl disc 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:56.489
 is actually this story that the 

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:59.070
 the vinyl disc is back only 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.350
 coming back to my question is where 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.000
 he was 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.530
 Because the staff says they're coming back. 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.530
 is really coming back to whoever 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.800
 had a lot of contact with george vi never 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:13.380
 ceased to exist always existed always 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:17.340
 disk was manufactured even after 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:20.640
 had this to the advent of cds and such and such 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:24.229
 I always had contact with one with music by 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:27.540
 some way from listening to the radio. 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:29.910
 said of my family or friends that 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.920
 had discussed victory at home 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:34.470
 my first professional job as 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.720
 paid destination 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:40.470
 I was 16 years old 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:43.170
 and at that time it was only vinyl was just a 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:46.319
 can play with a mixer and 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:50.959
 did not even exist. 

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:57.259
 Old English word of insomnia 

00:01:50.959 --> 00:01:57.259
 that spelling is from egfr 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:03.660
 What does tester tester mean? 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:07.020
 sense of a professional in an area 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:12.060
 to almost make a living for the family 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:14.640
 there I tried to use the testator as testator 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:19.440
 music tester that 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:21.240
 maybe something a little confusing 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.910
 so basically it would be a tester 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:30.270
 more written in a different way than it is 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:33.180
 currently it is vehicles and it is leaked 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:35.480
 It's one thing that a double sense of 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.480
 gamma 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:43.320
 I have the privilege to play but I 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:45.400
 I like to play what I believe 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:47.110
 especially with respect to the public and 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.780
 we also try to play something 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:52.600
 I like and do not care about an audience 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:55.330
 quite the opposite I try to unite the 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:56.830
 useful to the pleasant understood the calls 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:59.110
 that of reading the track 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:01.750
 to understand who the people are there 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:04.980
 at the moment is trying to please everyone 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:10.180
 as difficult as it is possible 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:12.280
 because people often 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:13.450
 hear the music she has on her ipod 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:17.020
 for example 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:18.580
 formerly the djs they were responsible 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:23.470
 for creating a site that played on radios 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:25.840
 fm will process unlike said 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:28.000
 took a disc was released in some 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.930
 place and played it to see the response of 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.230
 people 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:34.180
 the positive answer somehow this 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:37.330
 went to the radio so it was a process 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:42.299
 reverse nowadays the djs not all are 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:42.299
 clear touch radio 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:48.820
 summarizing my history with 11 was the 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:50.620
 The next I have a friend of mine sent me 

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:52.330
 a message in Mexico saying that I am 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:55.150
 Here was where to buy to 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:57.640
 I make money that you think it is 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:59.140
 interesting to buy at the moment I 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:01.989
 I explained to him that it was interesting 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:05.739
 because he needed it and I stayed 

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:07.540
 curious men said this as if I 

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:09.700
 It was because you 're there like that. 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:12.400
 You went to what was the reason 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:15.880
 He explained the reasons for it so did he 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:19.810
 invited me to stay for a year in 

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:21.519
 his house living with and like that I thought 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:25.570
 well on the subject 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:27.820
 I stayed there for a period of one year 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:29.229
 Waiting for money in Brazil, I already worked 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:30.550
 just as a herge 

00:04:29.229 --> 00:04:33.430
 so I stayed for a year 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:34.710
 basically save money by earning money 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:38.410
 come here 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:40.660
 the idea was to stay a year I ended up 

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:42.250
 I've been there for eight 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:46.360
 I worked a long time in the kitchen because 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:48.310
 I think a year and a half ago I was already 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:49.230
 working in the kitchen was already 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:51.570
 starting 

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:55.020
 at the same time until it reached a point 

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:56.970
 who had more money I got the pro 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:59.910
 head chef is thank you for all the 

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:00.600
 opportunity but I will follow my 

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:03.450
 way 

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:07.610
 I risked threw me was only in the area of 

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:07.610
 Money and thanks God it worked. 

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:20.850
 Good nowadays, I'm fortunately so full. 

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:23.580
 time and I have five residences in one 

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:25.200
 radio program also work 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:26.430
 Ice cool because you always are 

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:28.320
 working in a different place 

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:31.020
 meeting different people 

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:34.470
 the routine is not having too much routine say 

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:37.500
 so it is very pleasurable, we can say if 

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:41.670
 basically I play Brazilian music 

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:43.410
 in some places but at the same time I 

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:47.220
 I'm in love with music like 

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:48.840
 music is not my mind closed only 

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:50.190
 for a music segment I like 

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:52.980
 a lot of things 

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:57.480
 I like sun of fanti's business 

00:05:52.980 --> 00:06:01.680
 August August of radio business and 

00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:04.230
 I like young again like every f 

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:06.840
 place I'm going to play I try to make a 

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:11.160
 sounds that go according to the location without 

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:15.450
 to know then is well has a lot of dynamics of 

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:16.830
 Anderson is a very versatile party of 

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:21.120
 marriage 

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:24.090
 I not ever played at an event at the Embassy 

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:25.620
 Brazilian, for example, I 've already played 

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:28.050
 in this area 

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:30.900
 if we talk about the risks I have 

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:32.510
 here in london i bought an average and 

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:37.470
 when I got to today an average of 

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:40.020
 2,500 and 3,000 reviews seem to wind more 

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:41.910
 in fact it is not much and neither 

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:44.430
 like the compartes know are the 

00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:47.100
 lower bids are only Arabs who each 

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:50.280
 There are people who like the next phase 

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:52.500
 - to study what is the 

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:53.750
 my partner there are lots of 

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:59.330
 story 

00:06:53.750 --> 00:07:02.930
 music books to you that the 

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:06.080

 disc only you can no story can not 

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:11.660
 can never be sure 

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:13.670
 most of my risks here that I 

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:16.520
 I bought it here in London I'm not soft. 

00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:19.820
 be mentioned Brazil needs here has 

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:23.030
 my collection on high - what I 

00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:29.150
 I bought a bus here in Europe and 

00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:31.340
 the Brazilian music to be a saying of 

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:34.900
 preferably am 

00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:39.950
 have to be passionate about the clear music 

00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:41.990
 that if you can search the music and 

00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:46.280
 listen to music even if it's not the song 

00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:49.130
 What are you doing, civil pun? 

00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:51.520
 I think important to always be connected in 

00:07:49.130 --> 00:07:54.200
 what happened is different and different 

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:57.560

00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:59.860
 touch this to open only as well 

00:07:57.560 --> 00:07:59.860
 understood 

00:08:00.050 --> 00:08:02.560
