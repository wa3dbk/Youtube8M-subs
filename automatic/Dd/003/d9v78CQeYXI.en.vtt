00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.870 
beautifully done I love his armor and
the<00:01:25.350> way<00:01:25.500> that<00:01:25.680> his<00:01:25.770> cape<00:01:26.009> is<00:01:26.159> attached<00:01:26.490> to<00:01:26.729> him

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
the way that his cape is attached to him

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.280 
the way that his cape is attached to him
though<00:01:27.210> because<00:01:27.360> of<00:01:27.570> the<00:01:27.689> way<00:01:27.840> the<00:01:27.990> cape<00:01:28.140> is

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
though because of the way the cape is

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:29.719 
though because of the way the cape is
attached<00:01:28.619> I<00:01:28.860> think<00:01:29.070> if<00:01:29.159> he<00:01:29.250> played<00:01:29.430> with<00:01:29.549> this

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
attached I think if he played with this

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:30.260 
attached I think if he played with this
way<00:01:29.850> too<00:01:29.909> much

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
way too much

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.910 
way too much
it<00:01:30.509> would<00:01:30.600> definitely<00:01:30.840> come<00:01:31.290> off<00:01:31.500> if<00:01:31.740> they

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
it would definitely come off if they

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.620 
it would definitely come off if they
detached<00:01:32.250> it<00:01:32.460> any<00:01:32.610> other<00:01:32.700> way<00:01:32.880> however<00:01:33.450> we

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
detached it any other way however we

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:34.789 
detached it any other way however we
would<00:01:33.720> have<00:01:33.840> missed<00:01:34.049> out<00:01:34.200> on<00:01:34.229> all<00:01:34.439> this<00:01:34.560> great

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
would have missed out on all this great

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.499 
would have missed out on all this great
sculpting<00:01:35.280> on<00:01:35.369> his<00:01:35.520> back<00:01:35.729> so<00:01:36.090> I<00:01:36.119> think<00:01:36.210> it<00:01:36.420> was

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
sculpting on his back so I think it was

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.179 
sculpting on his back so I think it was
worth<00:01:36.659> it<00:01:36.930> even<00:01:37.049> though<00:01:37.409> his<00:01:37.560> arms<00:01:37.860> are<00:01:38.009> folded

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
worth it even though his arms are folded

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.160 
worth it even though his arms are folded
and<00:01:38.579> hiding<00:01:39.000> most<00:01:39.150> of<00:01:39.360> his<00:01:39.450> chest<00:01:39.750> armor<00:01:40.049> I

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
and hiding most of his chest armor I

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.660 
and hiding most of his chest armor I
love<00:01:40.590> that<00:01:40.860> they<00:01:40.979> just<00:01:41.130> put<00:01:41.369> in<00:01:41.490> whatever

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
love that they just put in whatever

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.910 
love that they just put in whatever
detail<00:01:42.180> they<00:01:42.329> possibly<00:01:42.780> could<00:01:43.170> whether<00:01:43.740> it's

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
detail they possibly could whether it's

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.800 
detail they possibly could whether it's
this<00:01:44.040> piece<00:01:44.280> separating<00:01:44.820> his<00:01:44.909> chest<00:01:45.270> or<00:01:45.780> the

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
this piece separating his chest or the

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:46.789 
this piece separating his chest or the
AB

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
AB

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.490 
AB
the<00:01:47.250> tail<00:01:47.520> looks<00:01:47.820> absolutely<00:01:48.210> fantastic<00:01:48.869> and

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
the tail looks absolutely fantastic and

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.350 
the tail looks absolutely fantastic and
I<00:01:49.710> have<00:01:49.890> to<00:01:50.040> say<00:01:50.220> that<00:01:50.369> I<00:01:50.430> love<00:01:50.759> his<00:01:50.970> boots

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
I have to say that I love his boots

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.719 
I have to say that I love his boots
they're<00:01:51.659> sculpted<00:01:52.200> very<00:01:52.380> very<00:01:52.649> naturally<00:01:53.310> and

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
they're sculpted very very naturally and

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.190 
they're sculpted very very naturally and
I<00:01:53.790> love<00:01:54.030> that<00:01:54.119> there's<00:01:54.299> the<00:01:54.420> sole<00:01:54.780> of<00:01:54.810> the<00:01:55.170> boot

have an added appreciation for the lines
on<00:01:59.729> the<00:01:59.790> bottom<00:02:00.060> of<00:02:00.149> his<00:02:00.270> boots<00:02:00.509> that<00:02:00.719> was<00:02:00.810> a

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
on the bottom of his boots that was a

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.600 
on the bottom of his boots that was a
nice<00:02:01.020> extra<00:02:01.350> little<00:02:01.590> detail<00:02:01.979> there<00:02:02.219> he<00:02:02.399> just

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
nice extra little detail there he just

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.639 
nice extra little detail there he just
looks<00:02:02.820> good<00:02:03.210> and<00:02:03.420> complete<00:02:03.869> in<00:02:04.020> every<00:02:04.229> single

angle that you put him in he's been a

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.730 
angle that you put him in he's been a
very<00:02:06.149> very<00:02:06.299> well<00:02:06.570> considered<00:02:07.200> really<00:02:07.590> a

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
very very well considered really a

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.680 
very very well considered really a
magnificently<00:02:08.489> detailed<00:02:08.700> little<00:02:09.149> figure<00:02:09.420> but

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
magnificently detailed little figure but

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:10.880 
magnificently detailed little figure but
if<00:02:09.780> you're<00:02:09.899> standing<00:02:10.080> him<00:02:10.379> on<00:02:10.500> most<00:02:10.709> surfaces

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
if you're standing him on most surfaces

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.860 
if you're standing him on most surfaces
you<00:02:11.250> will<00:02:11.430> need<00:02:11.640> his<00:02:11.790> base<00:02:12.000> it's<00:02:12.420> pretty<00:02:12.690> nice

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
you will need his base it's pretty nice

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:13.390 
you will need his base it's pretty nice
for<00:02:13.050> one<00:02:13.200> of<00:02:13.260> the

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
standard little basis it's got the

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
saying royal symbol on it this is very

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:18.699 
saying royal symbol on it this is very
much<00:02:17.030> if<00:02:17.239> not<00:02:17.390> exactly<00:02:17.840> like<00:02:18.079> what<00:02:18.260> the<00:02:18.349> Bondi

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:18.709 
much if not exactly like what the Bondi

real<00:02:18.950> works<00:02:19.189> figures<00:02:19.549> stand<00:02:19.849> on<00:02:20.000> this<00:02:20.269> is

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
real works figures stand on this is

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.330 
real works figures stand on this is
hardly<00:02:20.780> the<00:02:20.989> fault<00:02:21.200> of<00:02:21.319> the<00:02:21.439> toy<00:02:21.680> but<00:02:21.980> the<00:02:22.040> one

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
hardly the fault of the toy but the one

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.160 
hardly the fault of the toy but the one
thing<00:02:22.670> that<00:02:22.879> would<00:02:22.970> make<00:02:23.030> it<00:02:23.269> even<00:02:23.510> better<00:02:23.689> is

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
thing that would make it even better is

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:26.170 
thing that would make it even better is
a<00:02:24.200> NAPA<00:02:24.680> to<00:02:25.040> go<00:02:25.159> with<00:02:25.400> him<00:02:25.579> he's<00:02:25.879> unfortunately

a NAPA to go with him he's unfortunately

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.780 
a NAPA to go with him he's unfortunately
