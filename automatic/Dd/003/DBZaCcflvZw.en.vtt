on<00:01:59.399> your<00:01:59.490> operating<00:01:59.549> system<00:02:00.060> version<00:02:00.740> you'll

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
on your operating system version you'll

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.050 
on your operating system version you'll
need<00:02:02.009> to<00:02:02.159> open<00:02:02.729> it<00:02:02.850> open<00:02:03.420> up<00:02:03.899> a<00:02:04.079> command<00:02:05.060> prompt

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
need to open it open up a command prompt

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:11.059 
need to open it open up a command prompt
however<00:02:06.450> you<00:02:06.570> can<00:02:07.160> so<00:02:08.239> hit<00:02:09.239> enter<00:02:09.920> and<00:02:10.920> i'll
