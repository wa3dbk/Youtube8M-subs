busy<00:05:21.210> enough<00:05:21.450> you'll<00:05:21.840> really<00:05:22.020> have<00:05:22.110> time<00:05:22.350> to

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:22.400 
busy enough you'll really have time to

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:25.360 
busy enough you'll really have time to
go<00:05:23.400> back<00:05:23.580> so<00:05:23.970> this<00:05:24.090> vessel<00:05:24.420> up<00:05:24.510> top<00:05:24.750> here<00:05:24.780> is

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:25.370 
go back so this vessel up top here is

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:32.120 
go back so this vessel up top here is
for<00:05:26.370> our<00:05:26.750> milk<00:05:27.750> bones<00:05:28.100> beer<00:05:29.100> mason<00:05:29.580> jar<00:05:31.130> malted

for our milk bones beer mason jar malted

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:35.390 
for our milk bones beer mason jar malted
barley<00:05:32.250> and<00:05:32.700> water<00:05:33.560> so<00:05:34.560> we<00:05:34.800> store<00:05:35.040> our<00:05:35.070> milk

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:35.400 
barley and water so we store our milk

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:37.340 
barley and water so we store our milk
ball<00:05:35.640> which<00:05:36.630> has<00:05:36.780> been<00:05:36.900> passed<00:05:37.050> through

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:37.350

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:40.140 
cracks pass through a mill and we store

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:41.450 
cracks pass through a mill and we store
it<00:05:40.230> up<00:05:40.320> here<00:05:40.500> until<00:05:40.650> the<00:05:40.800> next<00:05:40.950> batch<00:05:41.130> is<00:05:41.340> ready

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:41.460 
it up here until the next batch is ready

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:44.630

to<00:05:41.640> go<00:05:41.760> in<00:05:42.210> our<00:05:42.360> kettle<00:05:42.540> this<00:05:43.020> is<00:05:43.140> where<00:05:43.350> we<00:05:43.640> add

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:44.640 
to go in our kettle this is where we add

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:50.450 
to go in our kettle this is where we add
hops<00:05:45.420> and<00:05:46.280> boil<00:05:47.280> for<00:05:47.840> over<00:05:48.840> an<00:05:48.930> hour<00:05:49.460> thus

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:50.460 
hops and boil for over an hour thus

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:54.280 
hops and boil for over an hour thus
sterilizing<00:05:51.420> the<00:05:51.450> worked<00:05:52.320> and<00:05:52.590> making<00:05:53.460> it

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:54.290 
sterilizing the worked and making it

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:56.950 
sterilizing the worked and making it

the boil come together in the center and
we<00:06:09.810> could<00:06:09.930> draw<00:06:10.110> up<00:06:10.290> cold<00:06:11.780> clear<00:06:12.780> liquid<00:06:13.460> and

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:14.460 
we could draw up cold clear liquid and

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:15.650 
we could draw up cold clear liquid and
send<00:06:14.700> it<00:06:14.820> through<00:06:15.000> a<00:06:15.030> heat<00:06:15.210> exchanger<00:06:15.240> and

send it through a heat exchanger and
over<00:06:15.900> to<00:06:16.020> the<00:06:16.460> fermenters<00:06:19.670> who<00:06:20.670> was<00:06:20.910> i<00:06:21.090> thirsty
