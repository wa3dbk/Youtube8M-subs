00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
of gaps in the midfield and it's really

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.920 
of gaps in the midfield and it's really
tough<00:00:20.250> to<00:00:20.490> play<00:00:20.930> without<00:00:21.930> that<00:00:22.320> support<00:00:23.930> three

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
of a through ball situation where you

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.660 
of a through ball situation where you
would<00:01:55.170> always<00:01:55.380> have<00:01:55.680> to<00:01:55.799> through<00:01:56.490> ball

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
would always have to through ball

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.280 
would always have to through ball
otherwise<00:01:57.119> it's<00:01:57.360> not<00:01:57.570> very<00:01:57.840> easy<00:01:58.020> to<00:01:58.200> get

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
otherwise it's not very easy to get

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.490 
otherwise it's not very easy to get
forward<00:01:58.670> it's<00:01:59.670> a<00:01:59.759> very<00:01:59.969> weak<00:02:00.899> formation<00:02:01.409> I

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
forward it's a very weak formation I

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.490 
forward it's a very weak formation I
find<00:02:01.710> the<00:02:02.310> four<00:02:02.520> two<00:02:02.729> two<00:02:03.000> two

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 
find the four two two two

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.050 
find the four two two two
has<00:02:03.620> good<00:02:03.830> possession<00:02:04.340> is<00:02:04.460> a<00:02:04.490> good<00:02:04.760> possession

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
has good possession is a good possession

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.810 
has good possession is a good possession
formation<00:02:05.840> and<00:02:05.990> it's<00:02:06.200> okay<00:02:06.740> offensively<00:02:07.520> as

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:07.820 
formation and it's okay offensively as

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.389 
formation and it's okay offensively as
well<00:02:08.179> as<00:02:08.330> defensively<00:02:08.990> but<00:02:09.800> if<00:02:09.979> you<00:02:10.100> don't<00:02:10.280> get

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:10.399 
well as defensively but if you don't get

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:11.830 
well as defensively but if you don't get
up<00:02:10.550> the<00:02:10.670> pitch<00:02:10.910> and<00:02:11.090> you<00:02:11.180> don't<00:02:11.360> keep<00:02:11.630> the

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
up the pitch and you don't keep the

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.300 
up the pitch and you don't keep the
possession<00:02:12.140> then<00:02:12.440> you<00:02:12.590> will<00:02:12.890> find<00:02:13.220> yourself

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
possession then you will find yourself

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:16.990 
possession then you will find yourself
buried<00:02:13.910> in<00:02:14.210> your<00:02:14.450> own<00:02:14.570> end<00:02:15.100> which<00:02:16.100> is<00:02:16.430> which

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
buried in your own end which is which

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.610 
buried in your own end which is which
kind<00:02:17.240> of<00:02:17.300> sucks<00:02:17.540> at<00:02:17.780> times<00:02:18.050> but<00:02:18.920> the<00:02:19.310> 4-2-3-1

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
kind of sucks at times but the 4-2-3-1

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.650 
kind of sucks at times but the 4-2-3-1
yeah<00:02:21.620> I<00:02:21.650> found<00:02:21.980> it<00:02:22.160> to<00:02:22.280> be<00:02:22.310> okay<00:02:22.940> offensively

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
yeah I found it to be okay offensively

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.960 
yeah I found it to be okay offensively
but<00:02:23.930> it<00:02:24.020> was<00:02:24.160> extremely<00:02:25.160> good<00:02:25.370> defensively

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
but it was extremely good defensively

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:27.850 
but it was extremely good defensively
because<00:02:26.360> it<00:02:26.510> there<00:02:26.810> always<00:02:27.080> feels<00:02:27.530> like<00:02:27.650> there

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
because it there always feels like there

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:29.170 
because it there always feels like there
are<00:02:27.950> six<00:02:28.130> men<00:02:28.280> back<00:02:28.550> with<00:02:28.790> those<00:02:28.940> center

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
are six men back with those center

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:33.310 
are six men back with those center
defensive<00:02:29.690> mids<00:02:30.430> they<00:02:31.430> do<00:02:31.490> play<00:02:32.360> both<00:02:32.780> up<00:02:33.050> and

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:33.320 
defensive mids they do play both up and

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:36.760 
defensive mids they do play both up and
down<00:02:33.530> the<00:02:34.370> pitch<00:02:34.550> which<00:02:34.850> is<00:02:35.120> good<00:02:35.570> but<00:02:35.870> there's

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:36.770 
down the pitch which is good but there's

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:42.940 
down the pitch which is good but there's
no<00:02:36.980> space<00:02:37.520> for<00:02:37.820> them<00:02:38.000> really<00:02:41.050> the<00:02:42.050> four<00:02:42.530> three

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
no space for them really the four three

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.420 
no space for them really the four three
one<00:02:43.340> two<00:02:44.470> it's<00:02:45.470> good<00:02:45.650> all<00:02:45.770> offensively<00:02:46.190> but

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
one two it's good all offensively but

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:47.949 
one two it's good all offensively but
the<00:02:46.550> center<00:02:46.760> forward<00:02:47.090> seems<00:02:47.300> invisible<00:02:47.840> at

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:47.959 
the center forward seems invisible at

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:50.290 
the center forward seems invisible at
times<00:02:48.230> solid<00:02:48.920> defensively<00:02:49.430> and<00:02:49.760> the<00:02:49.910> midfield

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:50.300 
times solid defensively and the midfield

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:54.550 
times solid defensively and the midfield
build-up<00:02:50.989> is<00:02:51.170> strong<00:02:52.420> the<00:02:53.420> four<00:02:53.780> three<00:02:54.260> two

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
build-up is strong the four three two

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.100 
build-up is strong the four three two
one<00:02:54.890> is<00:02:55.100> very<00:02:55.400> similar<00:02:55.730> to<00:02:56.180> the<00:02:56.720> four<00:02:56.930> three

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:57.110 
one is very similar to the four three

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:00.010 
one is very similar to the four three
one<00:02:57.290> two<00:02:57.500> but<00:02:58.190> the<00:02:58.640> offense<00:02:59.270> is<00:02:59.420> a<00:02:59.450> bit<00:02:59.780> better

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:00.020 
one two but the offense is a bit better

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:03.040 
one two but the offense is a bit better
when<00:03:00.290> making<00:03:00.470> em<00:03:01.120> rushes<00:03:02.120> up<00:03:02.300> with<00:03:02.540> three

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.050 
when making em rushes up with three

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:06.100 
when making em rushes up with three
balls<00:03:03.260> in<00:03:03.470> l1<00:03:03.860> X<00:03:04.130> or<00:03:04.430> l1<00:03:04.940> a<00:03:05.150> whatever<00:03:05.630> console

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:06.110 
balls in l1 X or l1 a whatever console

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:07.720 
balls in l1 X or l1 a whatever console
you're<00:03:06.230> playing<00:03:06.440> on<00:03:06.590> and<00:03:06.890> it's<00:03:07.459> very

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
you're playing on and it's very

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:11.620 
you're playing on and it's very
important<00:03:08.239> for<00:03:08.390> the<00:03:08.480> forwards<00:03:08.870> to<00:03:09.560> do<00:03:09.680> that<00:03:10.630> so

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:11.630 
important for the forwards to do that so

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:14.710 
important for the forwards to do that so
the<00:03:11.750> 4-3-3<00:03:12.260> is<00:03:12.830> a<00:03:13.310> good<00:03:13.640> formation<00:03:14.000> especially

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 
the 4-3-3 is a good formation especially

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:17.020 
the 4-3-3 is a good formation especially
when<00:03:14.870> using<00:03:15.080> the<00:03:15.290> outside<00:03:15.440> wings<00:03:15.950> it<00:03:16.640> relies

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 
when using the outside wings it relies

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.900 
when using the outside wings it relies
on<00:03:17.060> the<00:03:17.330> center<00:03:17.750> mids<00:03:18.049> quite<00:03:18.709> a<00:03:18.980> bit<00:03:19.489> just

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910 
on the center mids quite a bit just

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:22.420 
on the center mids quite a bit just
because<00:03:20.320> you<00:03:21.320> know<00:03:21.470> they're<00:03:21.739> there<00:03:22.070> they

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430 
because you know they're there they

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:23.949 
because you know they're there they
pretty<00:03:22.670> much<00:03:22.820> hold<00:03:23.090> up<00:03:23.209> the<00:03:23.360> team<00:03:23.600> in<00:03:23.780> there

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:23.959 
pretty much hold up the team in there

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:25.840 
pretty much hold up the team in there
and<00:03:24.170> they<00:03:24.709> can<00:03:25.010> get<00:03:25.160> the<00:03:25.250> ball<00:03:25.430> to<00:03:25.700> those

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:25.850 
and they can get the ball to those

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:28.180 
and they can get the ball to those
wingers<00:03:26.360> which<00:03:26.750> is<00:03:26.959> a<00:03:27.230> good<00:03:27.620> help<00:03:27.890> especially

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:28.190 
wingers which is a good help especially

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:29.920 
wingers which is a good help especially
if<00:03:28.430> you're<00:03:28.670> the<00:03:29.000> type<00:03:29.180> of<00:03:29.209> player<00:03:29.540> who<00:03:29.720> loves

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:29.930 
if you're the type of player who loves

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:35.880 
if you're the type of player who loves
the<00:03:30.080> pace<00:03:30.320> and<00:03:30.530> likes<00:03:30.680> across<00:03:31.070> the<00:03:31.280> ball

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:35.890 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:39.150 

the<00:03:36.400> 4<00:03:36.640> or<00:03:36.730> 4/1<00:03:37.000> one<00:03:37.510> is<00:03:37.690> extremely<00:03:38.680> similar<00:03:39.010> to

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:39.160 
the 4 or 4/1 one is extremely similar to

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:42.480 
the 4 or 4/1 one is extremely similar to
the<00:03:39.400> 4<00:03:39.850> 5<00:03:40.390> 1<00:03:40.840> and<00:03:41.080> the<00:03:41.140> 4<00:03:41.380> 4<00:03:41.560> 2<00:03:41.830> but<00:03:42.130> the<00:03:42.220> center

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:42.490

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:43.920 
the 4 5 1 and the 4 4 2 but the center
forward<00:03:42.850> seems<00:03:43.090> pointless<00:03:43.420> in<00:03:43.780> this

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:43.930 
forward seems pointless in this

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:46.710 
forward seems pointless in this
formation<00:03:44.380> as<00:03:45.000> there<00:03:46.000> aren't<00:03:46.180> many<00:03:46.390> players

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.720

formation as there aren't many players
forward<00:03:47.170> enough<00:03:47.380> to<00:03:47.560> get<00:03:47.710> good<00:03:47.740> distribution

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.250 
forward enough to get good distribution

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:51.390 
forward enough to get good distribution
and<00:03:48.850> attack<00:03:49.150> quickly<00:03:49.660> but<00:03:50.170> the<00:03:50.290> 4<00:03:50.530> 4<00:03:50.800> 2<00:03:51.100> on<00:03:51.280> the

often<00:03:54.400> but<00:03:54.670> there<00:03:54.790> are<00:03:54.910> many<00:03:55.090> gaps<00:03:55.300> in<00:03:55.600> the

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:55.690 
often but there are many gaps in the

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:57.480 
often but there are many gaps in the
field<00:03:55.930> especially<00:03:56.140> between<00:03:56.650> the<00:03:56.830> defense<00:03:57.280> and

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:57.490 
field especially between the defense and

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:03.660 
field especially between the defense and
the<00:03:57.880> midfield<00:03:58.240> as<00:03:58.480> they<00:03:58.660> do<00:03:58.720> play<00:03:59.170> flat<00:04:02.670> it's

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:03.670 
the midfield as they do play flat it's

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:09.780 
the midfield as they do play flat it's
great<00:04:06.600> with<00:04:07.600> the<00:04:07.780> 4<00:04:07.990> or<00:04:08.050> 5<00:04:08.260> 1<00:04:08.590> your<00:04:09.280> midfield

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:09.790 
great with the 4 or 5 1 your midfield

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:11.790 
great with the 4 or 5 1 your midfield
will<00:04:10.060> outnumber<00:04:10.240> the<00:04:10.780> opposing<00:04:11.170> players<00:04:11.500> and

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:11.800 
will outnumber the opposing players and

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:13.590 
will outnumber the opposing players and
you'll<00:04:12.100> have<00:04:12.310> a<00:04:12.340> lot<00:04:12.730> of<00:04:12.760> support<00:04:13.450> from

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:13.600 
you'll have a lot of support from

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:15.540 
you'll have a lot of support from
defense<00:04:14.170> but<00:04:14.620> the<00:04:14.709> biggest<00:04:14.890> problem<00:04:15.130> is<00:04:15.489> that

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:15.550 
defense but the biggest problem is that

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:17.940 
defense but the biggest problem is that
the<00:04:16.299> outside<00:04:16.329> midfielders<00:04:17.260> are<00:04:17.470> almost

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:17.950 
the outside midfielders are almost

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:20.789 
the outside midfielders are almost
useless<00:04:18.790> since<00:04:19.750> there<00:04:19.989> are<00:04:20.140> so<00:04:20.350> many<00:04:20.500> men

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:20.799 
useless since there are so many men

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:23.730 
useless since there are so many men
playing<00:04:21.130> back<00:04:21.489> and<00:04:21.760> not<00:04:21.970> enough<00:04:22.240> forward<00:04:22.740> 4:33

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:23.740 
playing back and not enough forward 4:33

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:25.680 
playing back and not enough forward 4:33
in<00:04:23.980> my<00:04:24.220> opinion<00:04:24.580> is<00:04:24.700> a<00:04:24.730> much<00:04:25.060> better<00:04:25.330> for<00:04:25.570> an

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:25.690 
in my opinion is a much better for an

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:28.230 
in my opinion is a much better for an
offensive<00:04:26.080> formation<00:04:26.760> we<00:04:27.760> skipped<00:04:28.030> through

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:28.240 
offensive formation we skipped through

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:32.460 
offensive formation we skipped through
the<00:04:28.360> 5<00:04:28.720> formations<00:04:29.590> if<00:04:29.830> you<00:04:29.980> didn't<00:04:30.220> notice<00:04:31.470> we

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:32.470 
the 5 formations if you didn't notice we

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:34.590 
the 5 formations if you didn't notice we
find<00:04:32.740> them<00:04:32.860> absolutely<00:04:33.250> horrible<00:04:33.550> yeah<00:04:34.300> but

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:34.600 
find them absolutely horrible yeah but

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:37.409 
find them absolutely horrible yeah but
uh<00:04:35.040> overall<00:04:36.040> you<00:04:36.580> got<00:04:36.730> you<00:04:36.910> just<00:04:37.120> have<00:04:37.270> to

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:37.419 
uh overall you got you just have to

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:39.870 
uh overall you got you just have to
choose<00:04:37.660> which<00:04:37.990> one<00:04:38.230> works<00:04:38.470> best<00:04:38.740> for<00:04:38.860> you<00:04:39.220> if<00:04:39.669> I

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:39.880 
choose which one works best for you if I

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:42.210 
choose which one works best for you if I
was<00:04:40.150> you<00:04:40.720> know<00:04:40.750> if<00:04:41.200> I<00:04:41.380> was<00:04:41.500> a<00:04:41.530> possession<00:04:41.860> base

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:42.220 
was you know if I was a possession base

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:45.630 
was you know if I was a possession base
player<00:04:42.610> I'd<00:04:42.970> probably<00:04:43.210> go<00:04:43.630> with<00:04:43.810> a<00:04:43.840> 4<00:04:44.770> to<00:04:45.040> 2<00:04:45.340> to

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:45.640 
player I'd probably go with a 4 to 2 to

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:50.880 
player I'd probably go with a 4 to 2 to
3<00:04:46.000> 5<00:04:46.510> to<00:04:47.430> 4<00:04:48.430> 4<00:04:48.669> to<00:04:48.700> even<00:04:49.690> those<00:04:50.140> are<00:04:50.320> definitely

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:50.890 
3 5 to 4 4 to even those are definitely

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:52.530 
3 5 to 4 4 to even those are definitely
the<00:04:51.010> best<00:04:51.040> formation<00:04:51.760> but

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:52.540 
the best formation but

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:54.300 
the best formation but
you<00:04:53.080> have<00:04:53.200> to<00:04:53.320> make<00:04:53.470> your<00:04:53.590> own<00:04:53.710> decision<00:04:54.160> right

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:54.310 
you have to make your own decision right
