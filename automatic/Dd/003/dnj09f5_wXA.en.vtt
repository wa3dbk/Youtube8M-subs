00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
any other of those two parts that I just

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.110 
any other of those two parts that I just
showed<00:01:11.160> you<00:01:11.190> you<00:01:11.400> should<00:01:11.670> get<00:01:11.820> something<00:01:12.030> like

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:12.120 
showed you you should get something like

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:37.850 
showed you you should get something like
this<00:01:12.360> for<00:01:12.420> your<00:01:12.630> reduction

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.350

progression that you're going to want to
have<00:01:43.930> for<00:01:44.380> both<00:01:44.500> hands<00:01:44.860> or<00:01:45.159> for<00:01:45.310> the<00:01:45.369> right

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:45.520

have for both hands or for the right
hand<00:01:45.700> is<00:01:45.880> going<00:01:45.909> to<00:01:46.030> go<00:01:46.150> as<00:01:46.240> follows

00:02:13.259 --> 00:02:13.269 

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:15.309 

with<00:02:14.269> the<00:02:14.390> left<00:02:14.660> hand<00:02:14.780> you're<00:02:15.050> going<00:02:15.140> to<00:02:15.230> be

00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:15.319 
with the left hand you're going to be

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:39.240 
with the left hand you're going to be
playing<00:02:15.590> this

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:41.260 

putting<00:02:40.250> those<00:02:40.340> two<00:02:40.610> parts<00:02:40.880> together<00:02:41.000> you

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:41.270 
putting those two parts together you

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:42.490 
putting those two parts together you
should<00:02:41.300> get<00:02:41.690> something<00:02:41.930> like<00:02:42.110> this<00:02:42.260> for<00:02:42.410> your

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
should get something like this for your

00:02:42.500 --> 00:03:08.490 
should get something like this for your
main<00:02:42.800> backing<00:02:43.340> track

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.890 

that's<00:03:09.500> your<00:03:09.620> main<00:03:09.800> backing<00:03:10.220> track<00:03:10.870> then<00:03:11.870> the

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
that's your main backing track then the

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:13.480 
that's your main backing track then the
vocal<00:03:12.380> line<00:03:12.410> from<00:03:12.710> the<00:03:12.830> course<00:03:13.070> is<00:03:13.280> going<00:03:13.340> to

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:13.490 
vocal line from the course is going to

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:39.280 
vocal line from the course is going to
go<00:03:13.610> as<00:03:13.730> follows<00:03:23.080> I<00:03:37.780> mean<00:03:38.780> that<00:03:38.900> together<00:03:39.140> with

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:39.290 
go as follows I mean that together with

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:40.750 
go as follows I mean that together with
the<00:03:39.380> same<00:03:39.620> left<00:03:39.860> hand<00:03:40.070> that<00:03:40.130> we<00:03:40.250> used<00:03:40.520> in<00:03:40.670> the

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 
the same left hand that we used in the

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.250 
the same left hand that we used in the
backing<00:03:41.060> track<00:03:41.240> from<00:03:41.420> before<00:03:41.750> this<00:03:41.990> is<00:03:42.140> your

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.260 
backing track from before this is your

00:03:42.260 --> 00:04:07.430
