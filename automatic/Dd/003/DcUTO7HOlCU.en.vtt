video<00:00:21.270> sooner<00:00:21.720> is<00:00:21.869> because<00:00:22.199> I<00:00:22.230> couldn't

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
video sooner is because I couldn't

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:23.960 
video sooner is because I couldn't
really<00:00:22.650> talk<00:00:22.890> in<00:00:23.189> them<00:00:23.369> I've<00:00:23.609> still<00:00:23.789> got<00:00:23.939> a

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
really talk in them I've still got a

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.529 
really talk in them I've still got a
little<00:00:24.119> bit<00:00:24.269> of<00:00:24.420> a<00:00:24.449> speech<00:00:26.000> impediment<00:00:27.000> thing

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
little bit of a speech impediment thing

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.810 
little bit of a speech impediment thing
at<00:00:27.660> the<00:00:27.750> moment<00:00:27.980> but<00:00:28.980> it's<00:00:29.070> getting<00:00:29.310> better<00:00:29.369> so

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
at the moment but it's getting better so

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.560 
at the moment but it's getting better so
I<00:00:29.880> thought<00:00:30.060> I'd<00:00:30.179> make<00:00:30.300> it<00:00:30.449> now<00:00:30.599> and<00:00:31.550> basically

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:32.570 
I thought I'd make it now and basically

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:35.060 
I thought I'd make it now and basically
these<00:00:33.570> are<00:00:33.630> the<00:00:33.870> retainers<00:00:34.440> that<00:00:34.710> I've<00:00:34.800> had

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
these are the retainers that I've had

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:42.410 
these are the retainers that I've had
put<00:00:35.370> in<00:00:38.960> and<00:00:40.309> they've<00:00:41.309> got<00:00:41.610> to<00:00:41.730> be<00:00:41.850> in<00:00:41.969> for

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
put in and they've got to be in for

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.790 
put in and they've got to be in for
three<00:00:43.140> months<00:00:44.120> basically<00:00:45.120> 24/7<00:00:45.780> so<00:00:46.440> I<00:00:46.469> can't

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
three months basically 24/7 so I can't

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.940 
three months basically 24/7 so I can't
take<00:00:47.010> them<00:00:47.160> out<00:00:47.309> and<00:00:48.320> unless<00:00:49.320> I'm<00:00:49.500> just

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
take them out and unless I'm just

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.500 
take them out and unless I'm just
brushing<00:00:50.219> my<00:00:50.250> teeth<00:00:50.520> that's<00:00:50.850> really<00:00:51.149> it<00:00:51.300> just

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
brushing my teeth that's really it just

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.720 
brushing my teeth that's really it just
to<00:00:52.289> make<00:00:52.410> sure<00:00:52.590> my<00:00:52.739> teeth<00:00:52.949> don't<00:00:53.190> go<00:00:53.399> back<00:00:53.610> to

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
to make sure my teeth don't go back to

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.250 
to make sure my teeth don't go back to
how<00:00:53.850> they<00:00:54.000> were<00:00:54.030> and<00:00:54.660> just<00:00:54.840> to<00:00:54.930> keep<00:00:55.079> them

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
how they were and just to keep them

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.290 
how they were and just to keep them
straight<00:00:55.590> because<00:00:56.250> apparently<00:00:56.579> if<00:00:56.730> they<00:00:56.850> go

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
straight because apparently if they go

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.119 
straight because apparently if they go
back<00:00:57.570> they're<00:00:58.050> not<00:00:58.199> covered<00:00:58.590> so<00:00:58.620> I<00:00:58.829> have<00:00:59.010> to

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
back they're not covered so I have to

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.619 
back they're not covered so I have to
pay<00:00:59.309> for<00:00:59.370> new<00:01:00.210> braces<00:01:00.660> again<00:01:02.420> throw<00:01:03.420> a<00:01:03.449> little

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
pay for new braces again throw a little

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.670 
pay for new braces again throw a little
bit<00:01:03.719> odd<00:01:03.870> because<00:01:05.150> they're<00:01:06.619> these<00:01:07.619> little

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
bit odd because they're these little

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.679 
bit odd because they're these little
plates<00:01:08.220> you're<00:01:08.640> put<00:01:08.939> you<00:01:09.360> got<00:01:09.450> to<00:01:09.510> kind<00:01:09.659> of

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
plates you're put you got to kind of

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.179 
plates you're put you got to kind of
click<00:01:09.960> him<00:01:10.140> in<00:01:10.260> all<00:01:10.350> the<00:01:10.500> time<00:01:10.710> new<00:01:10.950> tongue

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
click him in all the time new tongue

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.160 
click him in all the time new tongue
gets<00:01:11.400> caught<00:01:11.640> behind<00:01:11.850> it<00:01:12.090> food<00:01:12.689> gets<00:01:12.960> caught

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
gets caught behind it food gets caught

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.330 
gets caught behind it food gets caught
in<00:01:13.350> them<00:01:13.610> so<00:01:14.610> in<00:01:14.850> a<00:01:14.939> way<00:01:15.150> it<00:01:16.110> feels<00:01:16.890> a<00:01:17.130> little

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
in them so in a way it feels a little

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.640 
in them so in a way it feels a little
bit<00:01:17.640> like<00:01:17.790> a<00:01:17.820> step<00:01:18.240> back<00:01:18.509> because<00:01:19.049> at<00:01:19.439> least

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
bit like a step back because at least

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.640 
bit like a step back because at least
the<00:01:19.860> braces<00:01:20.310> were<00:01:20.460> quite<00:01:20.729> easy<00:01:21.390> as<00:01:22.049> they<00:01:22.590> were

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
the braces were quite easy as they were

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.740 
the braces were quite easy as they were
just<00:01:22.740> they<00:01:23.220> were<00:01:23.250> they're<00:01:23.520> not<00:01:23.820> much<00:01:24.270> food<00:01:24.509> got

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
just they were they're not much food got

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.020 
just they were they're not much food got
stuck<00:01:25.049> in<00:01:25.200> them<00:01:25.350> really<00:01:25.549> so<00:01:26.549> they<00:01:26.700> weren't<00:01:26.880> too

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
stuck in them really so they weren't too

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.700 
stuck in them really so they weren't too
much<00:01:27.180> of<00:01:27.330> a<00:01:27.390> bother<00:01:27.570> but<00:01:27.750> now<00:01:28.020> this<00:01:28.229> feels<00:01:28.500> like

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
much of a bother but now this feels like

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.170 
much of a bother but now this feels like
you've<00:01:28.860> actually<00:01:28.979> got<00:01:29.400> something<00:01:29.880> else<00:01:30.000> in

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
you've actually got something else in

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.620 
you've actually got something else in
your<00:01:30.299> mouth<00:01:30.540> and<00:01:30.930> it<00:01:31.650> kind<00:01:31.920> of<00:01:32.119> restricts<00:01:33.119> your

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
your mouth and it kind of restricts your

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.319 
your mouth and it kind of restricts your
mouth<00:01:33.780> to<00:01:34.020> a<00:01:34.049> certain<00:01:34.350> degree<00:01:34.759> so<00:01:35.759> yeah<00:01:36.090> it

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
mouth to a certain degree so yeah it

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.260 
mouth to a certain degree so yeah it
feels<00:01:36.869> like<00:01:37.020> a<00:01:37.140> little<00:01:37.439> bit<00:01:37.560> of<00:01:37.619> a<00:01:37.680> step<00:01:37.890> back

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
feels like a little bit of a step back

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.030 
feels like a little bit of a step back
but<00:01:39.270> I<00:01:39.509> knew<00:01:39.810> this<00:01:39.960> would<00:01:40.110> probably<00:01:40.229> happen<00:01:40.530> so

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
but I knew this would probably happen so

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.780 
but I knew this would probably happen so
I'm<00:01:41.670> not<00:01:41.909> too<00:01:42.240> bothered<00:01:42.600> about<00:01:42.810> it<00:01:42.990> and<00:01:43.350> also<00:01:44.220> I

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
I'm not too bothered about it and also I

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.460 
I'm not too bothered about it and also I
think<00:01:44.939> what<00:01:45.479> will<00:01:45.570> happen<00:01:45.869> is<00:01:46.020> once<00:01:46.290> I've<00:01:46.439> had

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
think what will happen is once I've had

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.490 
think what will happen is once I've had
these<00:01:46.740> on<00:01:46.979> for<00:01:47.159> three<00:01:47.430> months<00:01:47.820> I'll<00:01:48.479> have<00:01:49.049> to

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
these on for three months I'll have to

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.160 
these on for three months I'll have to
wear<00:01:50.340> it<00:01:50.520> every<00:01:50.820> night<00:01:51.000> for<00:01:51.030> the<00:01:51.630> rest<00:01:51.960> of<00:01:52.049> my

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
wear it every night for the rest of my

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.660 
wear it every night for the rest of my
life<00:01:52.200> because<00:01:52.799> that's<00:01:52.920> what<00:01:53.070> a<00:01:53.189> lot<00:01:53.340> of<00:01:53.369> people

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
life because that's what a lot of people

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.010 
life because that's what a lot of people
with<00:01:55.009> who<00:01:56.009> have<00:01:56.130> just<00:01:56.369> had<00:01:56.520> braces<00:01:56.790> have<00:01:57.630> to<00:01:57.840> do

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
with who have just had braces have to do

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.690 
with who have just had braces have to do
now<00:01:58.290> anyway<00:01:58.469> so<00:01:58.710> I<00:01:58.979> assume<00:01:59.280> that'll<00:01:59.520> be<00:01:59.579> the

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
now anyway so I assume that'll be the

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
basically be the end of the process well

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.650 
basically be the end of the process well
as<00:02:37.500> far<00:02:37.740> as<00:02:37.860> it<00:02:37.980> can<00:02:38.160> go<00:02:38.370> anyway<00:02:38.730> because<00:02:38.760> I've

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
as far as it can go anyway because I've

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.030 
as far as it can go anyway because I've
gotta<00:02:39.870> wear<00:02:40.020> these<00:02:40.170> for<00:02:40.560> the<00:02:40.680> rest<00:02:40.860> of<00:02:40.920> my<00:02:41.010> life

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
gotta wear these for the rest of my life

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.290 
gotta wear these for the rest of my life
at<00:02:41.640> night<00:02:41.940> so<00:02:42.330> that's<00:02:42.570> not<00:02:42.720> going<00:02:42.870> to<00:02:42.930> stop<00:02:43.050> and

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:44.300 
at night so that's not going to stop and

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:48.470 
at night so that's not going to stop and
basically<00:02:45.300> last<00:02:45.540> visible<00:02:46.200> thing<00:02:46.440> is<00:02:47.480> swelling

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
basically last visible thing is swelling

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.140 
basically last visible thing is swelling
and<00:02:48.840> the<00:02:49.710> last<00:02:49.920> that<00:02:50.190> kind<00:02:50.400> of<00:02:50.460> thing<00:02:50.970> to

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
and the last that kind of thing to

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:52.940 
and the last that kind of thing to
actually<00:02:51.450> go<00:02:51.600> is<00:02:51.810> the<00:02:52.050> numbness<00:02:52.260> which<00:02:52.800> should

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
actually go is the numbness which should

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.840 
actually go is the numbness which should
take<00:02:53.100> about<00:02:53.160> a<00:02:53.340> year<00:02:54.950> if<00:02:55.950> it<00:02:56.130> all<00:02:56.250> goes<00:02:56.400> anyway

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
take about a year if it all goes anyway

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.720 
take about a year if it all goes anyway
and<00:02:57.240> you<00:02:57.390> can<00:02:57.540> still<00:02:57.810> tell<00:02:58.110> where<00:02:58.800> smile<00:02:59.280> I

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
and you can still tell where smile I

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.350 
and you can still tell where smile I
think<00:03:00.300> it's<00:03:00.450> this<00:03:00.570> side<00:03:01.850> it<00:03:02.850> goes<00:03:03.060> back<00:03:03.330> a

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
think it's this side it goes back a

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:04.580 
think it's this side it goes back a
little<00:03:03.660> further<00:03:03.930> because<00:03:04.200> the<00:03:04.380> swelling

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
little further because the swelling

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.460 
little further because the swelling
still<00:03:04.950> a<00:03:04.980> bit<00:03:05.160> more<00:03:05.280> prominent<00:03:05.460> on<00:03:05.700> this<00:03:05.910> side

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470 
still a bit more prominent on this side

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:08.780 
still a bit more prominent on this side
there's<00:03:07.470> not<00:03:07.620> loads<00:03:07.800> but<00:03:08.100> I<00:03:08.160> can<00:03:08.340> still<00:03:08.550> see<00:03:08.760> it

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
there's not loads but I can still see it

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:12.920 
there's not loads but I can still see it
and<00:03:09.090> I<00:03:09.150> can<00:03:09.300> still<00:03:09.510> feel<00:03:09.720> it<00:03:11.300> but<00:03:12.300> I<00:03:12.510> think<00:03:12.810> it's

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
and I can still feel it but I think it's

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:14.210 
and I can still feel it but I think it's
just<00:03:13.020> cuz<00:03:13.230> I've<00:03:13.320> been<00:03:13.440> looking<00:03:13.740> myself<00:03:14.070> so
