bits<00:02:04.530> off<00:02:04.860> the<00:02:04.890> hair<00:02:05.430> dye<00:02:05.640> because<00:02:06.000> you<00:02:06.119> don't

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
bits off the hair dye because you don't

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.109 
bits off the hair dye because you don't
want<00:02:06.420> to<00:02:06.479> put<00:02:06.659> it<00:02:06.750> all<00:02:06.899> in<00:02:07.320> at<00:02:07.560> one

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
want to put it all in at one

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:10.479 
want to put it all in at one
because<00:02:08.420> it<00:02:08.629> might<00:02:08.810> be<00:02:08.869> too<00:02:09.170> much<00:02:09.319> I<00:02:09.709> would

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:10.489 
because it might be too much I would

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:13.270 
because it might be too much I would
always<00:02:10.670> just<00:02:10.849> have<00:02:11.510> less<00:02:11.870> and<00:02:12.260> add<00:02:12.470> more<00:02:12.890> depth

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
always just have less and add more depth

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.300 
always just have less and add more depth
having<00:02:13.849> too<00:02:14.060> much<00:02:14.239> and<00:02:14.629> then<00:02:14.780> like<00:02:15.099> you<00:02:16.099> can't

you're doing it yourself and if it's not
professional<00:02:48.290> it's<00:02:48.829> probably<00:02:49.400> not<00:02:49.489> gonna<00:02:49.670> be

00:02:49.809 --> 00:02:49.819 
professional it's probably not gonna be

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:52.420 
professional it's probably not gonna be
the<00:02:49.910> best<00:02:50.410> after<00:02:51.410> you<00:02:51.500> have<00:02:51.709> your<00:02:51.920> desired

00:02:54.339 --> 00:02:54.349 
color and you mix it all up and you

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:56.259 
color and you mix it all up and you
really<00:02:54.739> you<00:02:55.069> really<00:02:55.099> need<00:02:55.700> to<00:02:55.879> mix<00:02:56.060> it<00:02:56.150> up

00:02:56.259 --> 00:02:56.269 
really you really need to mix it up

00:02:56.269 --> 00:02:59.380 
really you really need to mix it up
perfectly<00:02:57.079> like<00:02:57.560> that's<00:02:58.400> the<00:02:58.670> most<00:02:58.879> important

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390 
perfectly like that's the most important

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:02.470 
perfectly like that's the most important
step<00:02:59.569> for<00:02:59.780> me<00:03:00.220> so<00:03:01.220> you<00:03:01.280> have<00:03:01.519> your<00:03:01.730> mixture<00:03:02.060> and

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
step for me so you have your mixture and

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.300 
step for me so you have your mixture and
then<00:03:02.900> you<00:03:03.049> just<00:03:03.290> want<00:03:03.530> to<00:03:03.560> part<00:03:03.829> your<00:03:03.920> hair<00:03:03.980> the

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
then you just want to part your hair the

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:07.150 
then you just want to part your hair the
way<00:03:04.340> you<00:03:04.519> would<00:03:05.090> like<00:03:05.420> to<00:03:05.810> I<00:03:06.079> usually<00:03:06.950> do<00:03:07.129> like

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:07.160 
way you would like to I usually do like

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.690 
way you would like to I usually do like
my<00:03:07.640> frog<00:03:07.910> pieces<00:03:08.450> and<00:03:08.980> then<00:03:09.980> in<00:03:10.190> the<00:03:10.280> back<00:03:10.459> I

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
my frog pieces and then in the back I

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:13.000 
my frog pieces and then in the back I
have<00:03:10.730> like<00:03:11.120> four<00:03:11.420> pieces<00:03:11.690> I<00:03:11.959> think<00:03:12.170> I<00:03:12.319> did<00:03:12.530> um

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010
