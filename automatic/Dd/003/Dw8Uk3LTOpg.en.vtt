this short report I'm going to show you

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.379

your blood sugar right away reducing
your<00:00:17.609> risk<00:00:17.670> of<00:00:18.060> high<00:00:18.210> blood<00:00:18.390> pressure<00:00:19.520> so<00:00:20.520> it

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
your risk of high blood pressure so it

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.509 
your risk of high blood pressure so it
appears<00:00:20.910> that<00:00:21.060> people<00:00:21.119> with<00:00:21.510> type<00:00:21.779> 1<00:00:22.020> diabetes

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:22.519 
appears that people with type 1 diabetes

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:26.599 
appears that people with type 1 diabetes
are<00:00:23.519> much<00:00:23.939> like<00:00:24.560> much<00:00:25.560> less<00:00:25.920> likely<00:00:26.310> to<00:00:26.340> suffer

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
are much like much less likely to suffer

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.640 
are much like much less likely to suffer
from<00:00:26.789> high<00:00:27.119> blood<00:00:27.150> pressure<00:00:27.630> if<00:00:27.930> they<00:00:28.320> keep<00:00:28.529> a

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
from high blood pressure if they keep a

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.740 
from high blood pressure if they keep a
tight<00:00:28.920> blood<00:00:29.609> sugar<00:00:29.939> control<00:00:30.269> for<00:00:30.660> an

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
tight blood sugar control for an

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.080 
tight blood sugar control for an
extended<00:00:31.320> period<00:00:31.470> of<00:00:31.619> time

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:32.090 
extended period of time

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:35.090 
extended period of time
so<00:00:33.090> diabetics<00:00:33.960> are<00:00:34.140> more<00:00:34.410> likely<00:00:34.770> to<00:00:34.890> have

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
so diabetics are more likely to have
