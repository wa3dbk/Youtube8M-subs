 [musics] 

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:20.360
 Lotto to be introduced this time is Light Game Limited 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:25.220
 This 3 types 647 difference 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:31.280
 82 is all this number represents the condition 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:35.420
 In this fish species that flow of this condition has flowed so far 

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:37.430
 It has been established , but the light game will evolve more and more 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:39.490
 Listening is 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:43.630
 The condition of the wolf 

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:45.280
 Because need has been lost, depending on the 3 things to choose 

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:47.540
 Rather than choosing 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:49.220
 I want to use it 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:55.160
 Change the way of fishing 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:55.970
 When it came to be able to use the tone that I want to use by slightly devising one's operation 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:02.540
 It means 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:03.140
 In the case of using type 64 , this tack has emerged in the middle layer with the bottom cut off and its axis 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:06.700
 From 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:10.550
 Passing a gimmick from the portion of I think that becomes the center 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:15.470
 Move Harris to the side and use it with such water 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:21.530
 Continue to result in trying to cause in the vicinity of the sea floor just in this 64 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:23.390
 In these cases , if you look closely at the seabed shape and propulsion before the expedition, the water depth will be 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:30.260
 Shallow consisting of bugs What 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:30.540
 In addition to wind a mechanism to such an extent as soon as possible there while predicting that come into the bedrock City 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:35.430
 By 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:40.600
 64 of this 6 to 4 near the seabed 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:44.799
 That place you can do with you length be in place 73 that can be in the can you 64 to 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:50.740
 And it is 82 type beginning which was quite different 

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:54.460
 When it comes to type 8 o'clock, it is quite ahead condition, but aimed at the big game in the state of 82 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:56.550
 Then it is not so to say that you can only do with shame 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:57.850
 You can do this with 73 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:03.189
 Everything is 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:06.460
 This rod tackle can not do this unless it is easy to handle 

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:12.170
 If you choose to do Tsurui stuff 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:19.209
 Whether to choose a yacht according to the listening or choose the one you want to use 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:19.209
 Look for your own taste carefully from among these three 

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:23.020

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:30.830
 The rule I used this time is 800 for Instructor Master 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:33.290
 Characteristic of the motor 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:37.700
 Invincible mode + 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:40.310
 You got a motor, and by this the island 's winding power 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:43.489
 How 59 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:47.720
 And the drag is 11 points 5 kg 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:49.660
 Year winding endurance is now seven kilometers very strong 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.930
 Invincible motor 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:52.819
 speed 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:55.250
 Anyway, speed is fast 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:58.819
 There was an impression that 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:03.950
 Speed ​​&amp; Power by Invincible Motor + 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:06.200
 This time it was to be used in collaboration with a new layer called Ride Game Limited 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:10.939
 Therefore, very agile 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:12.220
 Go instantly coral and firmly rolled up when you want to move 

00:03:10.939 --> 00:03:15.880
 Also 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:19.850
 Take advantage of the drag on the fish and only tension 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:23.540
 By saying that wind up or to weaken 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:27.860
 I was able to say quite big campachi and Omachi 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:31.660
 The important thing is first what waterfall you want to use 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:33.000
 To efficiently just come a time instead of strings 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:36.290
 Also 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.590
 Not only do you change the pack a little 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:43.769
 Find new ways to enjoy 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:43.769
 I think these things are very close 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:48.340
 Oh 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:48.340
 Hmm

00:04:59.569 --> 00:05:04.059
 It has come up 

00:05:01.249 --> 00:05:04.059
 I think as a Pa' 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:07.830

 Data without mussel 

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:15.750
 I do not think that reel
