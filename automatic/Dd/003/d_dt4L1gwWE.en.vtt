00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.230
 this is and his students 

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:06.230
 this is the lake of galilee it is beautifully situated 

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:10.860
 and lie a fishing boat on the side the rest of the boat are on the water 

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:15.539
 nevertheless there are a lot of people and these people tell each other stories 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.660
 stories about boats that end up in stone 

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:23.580
 and stories about the friezes they caught and how big they are not 

00:00:23.579 --> 00:00:24.659
 goods 

00:00:24.659 --> 00:00:27.489
 actually these stories have been told for a long time 

00:00:27.489 --> 00:00:31.989
 but lately and not the story tells stories about one 

00:00:31.989 --> 00:00:33.300
 special man 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.080
 a man called jesus 

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:38.150
 it seems that this jesus 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:39.750
 people not a witch 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.350
 and that he is coming from people who are being bullied 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:44.010
 or who are alone 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.690
 These stories don't make them so special that you have heard them more often 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.299
 in the middle of the lake of galilee she offered 

00:00:51.299 --> 00:00:53.900
 and there are two brothers in that boat 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:55.780
 the hand is in the buyers 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.780
 they throw out their nets and try to stand firm 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.019
 on the lake side are also two fishermen 

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:04.810
 it's someone one of the responses 

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:05.910
 also brothers 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:09.420
 They don't have that much money and can't get butter 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.570
 therefore just fancy eating out by the side of the lake 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.970
 andreas says simon then he comes to us 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:19.080
 and who is his groin 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.500
 this closed on syn rydbewiis 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:22.820
 and he asks one 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:23.930
 Come to me 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.140
 I have other work for you 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:27.880
 ask people 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.360
 immediately they leave their nets and go with him 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.360
 when they are on the road they see a boat lying in the distance 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:37.910
 there are two fishermen again 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:42.650
 it is the hand and the codes they are now back and working on the nets 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:44.750
 fix it 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:46.900
 also their brothers 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:50.320
 he says do you go with me too 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:51.530
 they do that 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.530
 they also want to go with two races but then with a light 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:59.810
 and a little later they all come to the city and they see a man in the city 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:00.900
 a counter 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:04.160
 he asks for money to man anyway 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:05.570
 it's just thijs 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:08.129
 and jesus says owner Chris Mattheus 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:09.799
 Do you want to go with me too? 

00:02:09.799 --> 00:02:11.969
 but Peking is with this 

00:02:11.969 --> 00:02:14.969
 and comes out of his cage there is also she 

00:02:15.869 --> 00:02:18.589
 So you have to agree that it is twelve months 

00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:20.199
 and these men 

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:22.269
 become students of enexis 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:25.279
 That means they want to learn from Jesus 

00:02:25.889 --> 00:02:29.429
 they stay close to him all the time so I look very carefully at what jesus 

00:02:29.429 --> 00:02:31.289
 death and what he says 

00:02:31.289 --> 00:02:34.489
 so they learn a lot from it 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:37.609
 more and more people come to this chair 

00:02:37.609 --> 00:02:40.799
 they listen to what jesus has to say 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:43.009
 jesus tells them 

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:45.139
 start a new life 

00:02:45.139 --> 00:02:47.420
 if it asks for something further 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.019
 to give 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:51.349
 but not with a grumpy face 

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:53.649
 m if you help someone 

00:02:53.649 --> 00:02:56.649
 Also don't tell everyone because you are with groups 

00:02:57.999 --> 00:02:59.029
 for your friends 

00:02:59.029 --> 00:03:00.610
 are you always nice of course 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:01.579
 she demands 

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:06.209
 but I also want you to sprint for people who are not skilled at you 

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:09.630
 you should not think of the people say 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:12.280
 that they don't like health are stupid 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:13.279
 jumped up 

00:03:13.279 --> 00:03:15.489
 and if you became someone with you 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:18.389
 you should not be invited to fight him there 

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:20.679
 but then you no longer have to make up for it 

00:03:20.679 --> 00:03:21.859
 saying sorry 

00:03:21.859 --> 00:03:23.889
 and forget 

00:03:23.889 --> 00:03:25.839
 You see them that they are enough 

00:03:25.839 --> 00:03:28.279
 how they can pin 

00:03:28.279 --> 00:03:31.679
 and show jesus students stute and on 8 

00:03:32.289 --> 00:03:33.959
 he says to them 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:37.589
 it won't take much longer than it will show well 

00:03:37.589 --> 00:03:40.589
 I can't do anything about the whole earth 

00:03:40.589 --> 00:03:42.010
 I would like 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:44.539
 that you are going to tell numbers of people 

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:47.539
 and that you tell them that I get a lot of geese 

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:50.549
 the people 

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:52.929
 made the sick better 

00:03:52.929 --> 00:03:56.079
 and nothing counts in aruba 

00:03:56.079 --> 00:03:57.190
 believe me 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:00.539
 I always saw you go with me 

00:04:00.539 --> 00:04:02.539
 end they did 

00:04:02.539 --> 00:04:05.539
 so this year it is not just heard this story 

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:08.820
 and like it very much in this case 

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:12.909
 if you also tell the story that jesus belonged to the people 

00:04:12.909 --> 00:04:14.539
 do you want to do that too from jesus
