00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:40.700 
your hand and that's a very sharp

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.430 
your hand and that's a very sharp
movement<00:01:41.210> so<00:01:41.390> really<00:01:41.720> don't<00:01:41.840> be<00:01:42.020> afraid<00:01:42.320> to

movement so really don't be afraid to

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:45.940 
movement so really don't be afraid to
this<00:01:42.590> strength<00:01:43.040> so<00:01:43.970> we<00:01:44.210> keep<00:01:45.020> moving<00:01:45.380> and<00:01:45.530> then

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:28.490 
to include at least four categories of

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:30.220

things pulling in all the different

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:33.520 
things pulling in all the different
energies<00:06:30.980> available<00:06:31.390> so<00:06:32.390> we<00:06:32.570> have<00:06:32.780> the

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:33.530 
energies available so we have the

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:36.580 
energies available so we have the
energies<00:06:33.950> of<00:06:33.980> air<00:06:34.900> they're<00:06:35.900> often<00:06:36.230> thought<00:06:36.530> of

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:36.590 
energies of air they're often thought of

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:40.690 
energies of air they're often thought of
as<00:06:36.919> clarity<00:06:37.580> of<00:06:37.610> mind<00:06:37.880> and<00:06:38.980> you<00:06:39.980> know<00:06:40.100> thinking

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:40.700 
as clarity of mind and you know thinking

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:43.300 
as clarity of mind and you know thinking
ability<00:06:41.210> analytical<00:06:42.020> ability<00:06:42.470> communication

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:43.310 
ability analytical ability communication

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:46.810 
ability analytical ability communication
and<00:06:43.700> of<00:06:43.880> course<00:06:44.090> breath<00:06:45.190> what<00:06:46.190> represents

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:46.820 
and of course breath what represents

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:49.090 
and of course breath what represents
that<00:06:47.000> may<00:06:47.630> be<00:06:47.690> feathers<00:06:48.229> may<00:06:48.740> be<00:06:48.800> bells

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:49.100 
that may be feathers may be bells

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:52.510 
that may be feathers may be bells
something<00:06:49.790> for<00:06:50.120> sound<00:06:50.560> your<00:06:51.560> veil<00:06:51.800> can<00:06:52.220> be<00:06:52.430> an

00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:52.520 
something for sound your veil can be an

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:55.210 
something for sound your veil can be an
instrument<00:06:52.820> for<00:06:53.180> air<00:06:53.390> so<00:06:54.020> air<00:06:54.260> is<00:06:54.290> usually<00:06:54.620> the

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:55.220 
instrument for air so air is usually the

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:57.219 
instrument for air so air is usually the
eastern<00:06:55.700> direction<00:06:55.910> but<00:06:56.479> these<00:06:56.930> are<00:06:57.110> all

00:06:57.219 --> 00:06:57.229 
eastern direction but these are all

00:06:57.229 --> 00:06:58.870 
eastern direction but these are all
suggestions<00:06:57.979> and<00:06:58.460> you're<00:06:58.550> gonna<00:06:58.640> have<00:06:58.820> to

00:06:58.870 --> 00:06:58.880 
suggestions and you're gonna have to

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:01.930 
suggestions and you're gonna have to
find<00:06:59.240> what<00:06:59.570> feels<00:06:59.810> genuine<00:07:00.770> to<00:07:01.010> you<00:07:01.190> the

find what feels genuine to you the

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:04.030 
find what feels genuine to you the
second<00:07:02.360> part<00:07:02.390> is<00:07:02.810> a<00:07:02.870> different<00:07:03.410> rhythm<00:07:03.560> but<00:07:03.890> we

00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:04.040 
second part is a different rhythm but we

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:05.950 
second part is a different rhythm but we
actually<00:07:04.190> will<00:07:04.700> follow<00:07:04.940> the<00:07:05.240> flute<00:07:05.540> more<00:07:05.810> in

00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:05.960 
actually will follow the flute more in

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:07.540 
actually will follow the flute more in
the<00:07:06.050> second<00:07:06.410> part<00:07:06.620> the<00:07:06.710> second<00:07:07.160> one<00:07:07.250> is<00:07:07.370> more

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:07.550 
the second part the second one is more

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:10.120 
the second part the second one is more
lyrical<00:07:08.210> and<00:07:08.600> we'll<00:07:08.930> bring<00:07:09.080> out<00:07:09.260> the<00:07:09.410> veil

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:10.130 
lyrical and we'll bring out the veil

00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:12.430 
lyrical and we'll bring out the veil
and<00:07:10.580> it's<00:07:10.940> a<00:07:11.060> little<00:07:11.300> bit<00:07:11.420> more<00:07:11.600> open<00:07:11.990> for<00:07:12.230> your

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:12.440 
and it's a little bit more open for your

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:14.110 
and it's a little bit more open for your
interpretation<00:07:13.310> it's<00:07:13.490> designed<00:07:13.910> on<00:07:14.090> the

00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:14.120 
interpretation it's designed on the

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:16.570 
interpretation it's designed on the
energies<00:07:14.690> and<00:07:15.050> how<00:07:15.350> your<00:07:15.680> circle<00:07:16.160> should<00:07:16.430> be

00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:16.580 
energies and how your circle should be

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:18.970 
energies and how your circle should be
finished
