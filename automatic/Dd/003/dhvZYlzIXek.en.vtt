right now we are really here but i read

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:23.340 
right now we are really here but i read
that<00:03:20.920> this<00:03:21.520> is<00:03:21.880> not<00:03:22.270> really<00:03:22.630> the<00:03:22.810> equator

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:23.350 
that this is not really the equator

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:27.930 
that this is not really the equator

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940 
equator lies about 240 meters from here

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:30.870 
equator lies about 240 meters from here
but<00:03:28.360> i<00:03:28.540> don't<00:03:28.720> know<00:03:28.780> which<00:03:28.990> way<00:03:29.880> probably

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:30.880 
but i don't know which way probably

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:32.880 
but i don't know which way probably
that's<00:03:31.090> why<00:03:31.240> or<00:03:31.660> if<00:03:31.840> that<00:03:32.020> was<00:03:32.260> supposed<00:03:32.680> to<00:03:32.800> be

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:32.890 
that's why or if that was supposed to be

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:35.130 
that's why or if that was supposed to be
on<00:03:33.070> a<00:03:33.100> mountain<00:03:33.580> or<00:03:33.700> something<00:03:33.810> and<00:03:34.810> that's

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:35.140 
on a mountain or something and that's

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:37.830 
on a mountain or something and that's
why<00:03:35.350> I<00:03:35.380> think<00:03:35.560> it's<00:03:35.980> that<00:03:36.250> way<00:03:36.430> ya<00:03:37.330> think<00:03:37.720> so

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
why I think it's that way ya think so

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:56.600 
why I think it's that way ya think so
too<00:03:38.070> it's<00:03:39.070> probably<00:03:39.250> halfway<00:03:39.670> that<00:03:40.120> mountain

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:56.610 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:58.400

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:07.250 
here that it actually takes about four

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:09.370 
here that it actually takes about four
hours<00:06:07.280> server<00:06:07.820> load<00:06:08.030> one<00:06:08.240> block<00:06:08.600> even<00:06:09.050> with<00:06:09.170> my

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:09.380 
hours server load one block even with my

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:12.340 
hours server load one block even with my
new<00:06:09.530> confession<00:06:10.100> settings<00:06:10.870> because<00:06:11.870> it<00:06:12.110> used
