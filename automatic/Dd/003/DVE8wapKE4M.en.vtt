00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:20.599
 hello, friends, how are you welcome? 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:24.349
 new tutorial and we have changed from 

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:28.250
 scene before we had a normal world and 

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:31.690
 now as you can see we have several zones of 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:37.480
 where are we going to do each tutorial 

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:41.020
 well today we are going to show you how to ride 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:44.680
 a chicken or chicken farm and that 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:46.820
 be self-sufficient let it be 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:50.739
 efficient not 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:57.010
 ok let's catch eggs let's catch 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:57.010
 posters stones and all this well 

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:00.780
 this would be in 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:08.750
 the farm we have up here the 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.410
 chickens 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:15.020
 that eggs will generate eggs 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:19.450
 will fall into the current and the current the 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.450
 will bring there and then we collect it 

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:26.179
 things that you have to have clear the 

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:29.299
 first that the trick of keeping the 

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:31.039
 water from above in suspension is by 

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:35.780
 posters or can also be with 

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:38.600
 stairs a poster occupies a block by 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:41.020
 so if we put the poster there is water 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:45.009
 over like this 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:46.780
 as you see it stays and that's how it is 

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:49.390
 there is the water that is preventing it 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:51.250
 there are two layers is the first and then 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:56.469
 we have this which is the second time with 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:59.890
 posters well and the second that the water 

00:01:56.469 --> 00:02:02.670
 from the core to the end are eight 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:05.350
 blocks worth does not touch you see is 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:08.979
 well that's what you have to have in 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:11.560
 account mainly then 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:13.810
 I go to these stairs and if you want 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.670
 decorate it then what you want to your 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:18.610
 taste and point 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:23.530
 let's build well 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:26.930
 we started by putting this structure 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:30.620
 2 x 2 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:32.299
 and we extended it here 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:36.349
 and this is where we are going to put the 

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:39.940
 posters is worth so let's put 

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:39.940
 posters not to get involved 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:47.849
 and then here and here 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.260
 therefore this would be the level of 

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:51.629
 Water 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:54.239
 so let's put two levels per 

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:54.950
 over so the chickens do not 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:58.170
 escape 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:03:01.579
 this would be at the height and now what 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.579
 we expand to our liking 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.490
 if we want to do it right in the 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:09.210
 stream until it runs 

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:13.310
 Finally 

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:13.310
 in space then we put the water 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:20.530
 until the water arrives therefore 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:23.890
 here we would collect the eggs 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:25.400
 let's decorate this if we put this 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:27.600
 here 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:30.170
 and here 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.170
 perhaps 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:44.640
 well we put more posters here here 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:49.830
 and here and then here too 

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:57.240
 good not good 

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:59.940
 this is removed 

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:03.090
 and we put here this so that the water does not 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:06.670
 escape well this would be our 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:10.069
 chicken enclosure 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:12.499
 we put the water that is calm 

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:15.650
 and as you can see here we can put the 

00:04:12.499 --> 00:04:19.609
 chickens well normally not 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:23.000
 we would have the chicken generator that 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:25.010
 is this egg in a normal game because 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.860
 we would have to lay eggs 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:30.940
 there is a small chance that 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:30.940
 come out the chicks 

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:37.279
 I recommend you to put 5 or 6 not 

00:04:35.279 --> 00:04:41.400
 put more than that number because if not 

00:04:37.279 --> 00:04:43.990
 causes you here as best in the 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:46.220
 game are oh my god 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:51.360
 I have died 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:54.419
 we put you 5 and 6 and this 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:56.490
 and you have to let them grow and when 

00:04:54.419 --> 00:05:00.639
 they will grow because they will be these and already these 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:03.759
 they will drop eggs and they will fall here 

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:06.750
 well this has been all for today to see if 

00:05:03.759 --> 00:05:10.910
 release some game that I do not think 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:10.910
 who are quite stressed 

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:15.510
 are you going to drop something or what 

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:22.319
 ah 

00:05:19.289 --> 00:05:24.820
 now they have released an egg 

00:05:22.319 --> 00:05:28.380
 false 

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:31.740
 as you can see the egg would go through here and 

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:31.740
 I would fall here 

00:05:31.889 --> 00:05:36.689
 and that's what sets it apart from a 

00:05:34.199 --> 00:05:39.030
 normal farm a normal farm just 

00:05:36.689 --> 00:05:40.770
 I would have the chickens here and that's it 

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:42.840
 this farm apart from that has the 

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:44.639
 eggs here and you can pick them up and come back 

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:47.009
 to throw them out and replay more 

00:05:44.639 --> 00:05:49.710
 chickens so good this is all for 

00:05:47.009 --> 00:05:52.430
 today until the next tutorial 

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:52.430
 goodbye
