00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:14.260 

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:17.370 

yeah<00:00:14.710> I<00:00:14.740> always<00:00:14.920> letting<00:00:15.220> me<00:00:15.430> for<00:00:16.200> release<00:00:17.200> in

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:17.380 
yeah I always letting me for release in

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:20.640 
yeah I always letting me for release in
there<00:00:17.970> because<00:00:18.970> most<00:00:19.810> of<00:00:19.930> the<00:00:20.020> Flyers<00:00:20.290> I<00:00:20.470> know

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:20.650 
there because most of the Flyers I know

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:23.820 
there because most of the Flyers I know
they<00:00:20.890> let<00:00:21.160> him<00:00:21.250> fly<00:00:22.230> when<00:00:23.230> their<00:00:23.349> stomach<00:00:23.710> is

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:23.830 
they let him fly when their stomach is

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:26.040 
they let him fly when their stomach is
empty<00:00:24.029> but<00:00:25.029> I<00:00:25.090> don't<00:00:25.270> like<00:00:25.390> doing<00:00:25.660> that<00:00:25.779> I

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:26.050 
empty but I don't like doing that I

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:27.750 
empty but I don't like doing that I
believe<00:00:26.470> that<00:00:26.500> their<00:00:26.770> fly<00:00:26.980> stronger<00:00:27.520> and<00:00:27.730> a

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:27.760 
believe that their fly stronger and a

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:33.180 
believe that their fly stronger and a
lot<00:00:27.939> more<00:00:29.670> evasive<00:00:31.379> towards<00:00:32.379> a<00:00:32.440> hog<00:00:32.650> if

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:33.190 
lot more evasive towards a hog if

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:35.130 
lot more evasive towards a hog if
they're<00:00:33.489> they<00:00:34.210> have<00:00:34.239> some<00:00:34.570> food<00:00:34.870> in<00:00:35.020> their

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:35.140 
they're they have some food in their

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:39.600 
they're they have some food in their
belly<00:00:36.059> just<00:00:37.059> but<00:00:37.270> I<00:00:37.300> don't<00:00:37.420> do<00:00:37.600> this<00:00:38.460> you<00:00:39.460> know

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:39.610 
belly just but I don't do this you know

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:42.840 
belly just but I don't do this you know
they<00:00:39.850> fly<00:00:40.090> slow<00:00:40.870> not<00:00:41.860> enough<00:00:42.100> energy<00:00:42.309> to<00:00:42.550> fly

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:42.850 
they fly slow not enough energy to fly

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:47.070 
they fly slow not enough energy to fly
long<00:00:43.120> but<00:00:43.540> not<00:00:43.780> enough<00:00:44.050> energy<00:00:45.600> but<00:00:46.600> this<00:00:46.870> way

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:47.080 
long but not enough energy but this way

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:50.210 
long but not enough energy but this way
I<00:00:47.320> can<00:00:47.920> keep<00:00:48.129> them<00:00:48.280> all<00:00:48.640> day<00:00:49.390> flying

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:50.220
