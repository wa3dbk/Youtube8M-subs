00:00:03.465 --> 00:00:07.151
I have only tested it once,
I will not do it after every cast.

00:00:07.481 --> 00:00:08.881
We have been fishing for an hour.

00:00:09.319 --> 00:00:11.020
I got a really nice pike.

00:00:13.372 --> 00:00:15.472
Down with the net.
Down with the net.

00:00:16.483 --> 00:00:20.083
I almost had a heart attack.
I felt that it was a big one.

00:00:20.975 --> 00:00:23.875
That is big!
It weighs more than 17 lbs.

00:00:32.982 --> 00:00:38.876
We have just come to a new place,
which we have never fished before.

00:00:39.215 --> 00:00:42.668
We threw all our stuff
into our cabin.

00:00:43.466 --> 00:00:48.564
After that, we took our boat out
on this lake for some evening fishing.

00:00:48.897 --> 00:00:56.897
You never know in the summer...
It can be great fishing in the evening.

00:00:57.481 --> 00:01:02.881
I put on a McRubber Jr as small
baits are very good in the summer.

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:08.130
It is our first day up here
and we have been fishing for an hour.

00:01:08.464 --> 00:01:13.562
I got a really nice pike that is
3 ft 7 inches and weighs about 17 lbs.

00:01:13.946 --> 00:01:18.346
We do not have to do anything.
- It so damn big.

00:01:18.862 --> 00:01:23.762
It got off all the coating of
the leader and got some of the hook.

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.340
I also got a pike.
It took my McRubber Mackerel Glow.

00:01:29.725 --> 00:01:34.358
I lit it up beforehand,
so it glew.

00:01:34.678 --> 00:01:37.739
I cast it out
and it took on the first cast.

00:01:38.964 --> 00:01:40.564
That is nice.
- Yes, it is.

00:01:40.941 --> 00:01:47.322
I will get this jig to glow some
with the flashlight of my cell phone.

00:01:47.853 --> 00:01:49.253
I shine on it like this.

00:01:50.187 --> 00:01:54.387
I have only tested it once,
I will not do it after every cast.

00:01:55.186 --> 00:01:56.338
But it worked.

00:01:57.743 --> 00:02:00.743
I did like that,
and there was a spot on the jig.

00:02:01.779 --> 00:02:03.892
Then the pike bit?
- Yes, it did.

00:02:04.592 --> 00:02:07.092
This is our second day.

00:02:21.854 --> 00:02:25.254
Tobbe has gotten
a big fish in his net.

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:29.327
Filip got it in the net,
I got it with my rod.

00:02:29.846 --> 00:02:31.346
We found it among the water lilies.

00:02:32.359 --> 00:02:35.559
I used a pike spoon.
- A Rapala Subwalk.

00:02:38.492 --> 00:02:39.676
Bye bye pike!

00:02:40.369 --> 00:02:42.269
Congratulations Filip!
You also got a big one.

00:02:42.749 --> 00:02:45.349
It is grotesque.
Filip, get the fish up.

00:02:45.683 --> 00:02:47.112
We got it in the net.

00:02:49.152 --> 00:02:50.752
There was barely room in the net.

00:03:01.878 --> 00:03:03.839
This is so damn big!

00:03:06.751 --> 00:03:09.928
Is it big?
- It is so damn big!

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:12.037
This could be...

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:31.460
Edvin cannot see how big it is.
- Of course I can see.

00:03:36.326 --> 00:03:40.340
I almost got a heart attack.
I felt that it was a big one.

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:44.370
It weighs about 19 lbs 3 oz.

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:47.388
It looks so big.
- It is pretty big.

00:03:48.156 --> 00:03:49.556
I thought it would weigh more.

00:03:50.011 --> 00:03:52.444
It is 3 ft and 8 inches.

00:03:55.297 --> 00:03:59.697
And it weighed 19 lbs 3 oz.
It is very big.

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:02.183
I got it in shoal water.

00:04:20.392 --> 00:04:21.821
Are you ready, Edvin?

00:04:23.111 --> 00:04:27.716
Yes, I am.
It is too close.

00:04:31.647 --> 00:04:33.971
That is a big one.
It weighs more than 17 lbs.

00:04:34.347 --> 00:04:36.347
Down with the net.
Down with the net.

00:04:37.574 --> 00:04:39.074
That is big, Tobbe.

00:04:41.382 --> 00:04:44.282
It is really big.
It weighs more than 17 lbs.

00:04:47.468 --> 00:04:50.268
Are you kidding me?
It is my pike.

00:04:52.142 --> 00:04:54.095
It is Edvin's pike.
- Yes, it is mine.

00:04:54.368 --> 00:04:57.937
It weighs 17 lbs and 4 oz.

00:04:58.405 --> 00:05:01.602
It is almost the same weight
as the other one. It is the same pike.

00:05:34.026 --> 00:05:39.026
