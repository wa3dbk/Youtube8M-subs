ghost<00:01:42.420> perk<00:01:42.750> but<00:01:43.320> if<00:01:43.500> you're<00:01:43.680> staying<00:01:44.040> still

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
ghost perk but if you're staying still

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.639 
ghost perk but if you're staying still
then<00:01:44.640> you're<00:01:44.759> going<00:01:44.850> to<00:01:44.909> be<00:01:45.030> detected<00:01:45.360> but<00:01:46.290> I

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
then you're going to be detected but I

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.039 
then you're going to be detected but I
don't<00:01:47.579> personally<00:01:48.000> think<00:01:48.270> that's<00:01:48.689> gonna<00:01:48.869> make

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
don't personally think that's gonna make

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.810 
don't personally think that's gonna make
a<00:01:49.110> blind<00:01:49.380> bit<00:01:49.560> of<00:01:49.649> difference<00:01:49.710> because<00:01:50.520> to<00:01:50.670> me

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
a blind bit of difference because to me

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.289 
a blind bit of difference because to me
when<00:01:51.060> I<00:01:51.149> be<00:01:51.299> playing<00:01:51.570> and<00:01:52.100> black<00:01:53.100> ups<00:01:53.340> the

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
when I be playing and black ups the

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:55.850 
when I be playing and black ups the
amount<00:01:54.570> of<00:01:54.720> people<00:01:54.780> who<00:01:55.110> actually<00:01:55.290> just<00:01:55.680> sit

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
amount of people who actually just sit

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.069 
amount of people who actually just sit
in<00:01:55.979> corners<00:01:56.430> we're<00:01:56.579> ghosts<00:01:56.790> is<00:01:57.000> very<00:01:57.840> very

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
in corners we're ghosts is very very

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:01.209 
in corners we're ghosts is very very
minimal<00:01:58.409> like<00:01:59.009> everyone<00:01:59.520> who<00:01:59.670> use<00:01:59.850> ghost<00:02:00.240> and

00:02:01.209 --> 00:02:01.219 
minimal like everyone who use ghost and

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:03.560 
minimal like everyone who use ghost and
tends<00:02:02.219> to<00:02:02.490> be<00:02:02.610> running<00:02:02.850> around<00:02:03.000> anyway

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
tends to be running around anyway

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.630 
tends to be running around anyway
because<00:02:03.780> you<00:02:04.740> know<00:02:04.829> it's<00:02:05.009> that<00:02:05.189> kind<00:02:05.399> of<00:02:05.430> perk

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
because you know it's that kind of perk

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.609 
because you know it's that kind of perk
you<00:02:05.790> just<00:02:06.000> have<00:02:06.180> to<00:02:06.420> use<00:02:06.570> it<00:02:06.780> so<00:02:06.810> I<00:02:06.930> don't<00:02:07.259> think

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
you just have to use it so I don't think

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.420 
you just have to use it so I don't think
and<00:02:08.090> ghost<00:02:09.090> is<00:02:09.330> gonna<00:02:09.649> be<00:02:10.649> all<00:02:10.860> that<00:02:10.890> different

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
and ghost is gonna be all that different

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:12.260 
and ghost is gonna be all that different
in<00:02:11.670> this<00:02:11.819> game

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
in this game

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.940 
in this game
I<00:02:12.630> think<00:02:12.960> it's<00:02:13.080> going<00:02:13.200> to<00:02:13.290> be<00:02:13.410> the<00:02:13.590> exact<00:02:13.920> same

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
I think it's going to be the exact same

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.880 
I think it's going to be the exact same
problems<00:02:14.790> as<00:02:15.150> black<00:02:15.990> ops<00:02:16.230> 2<00:02:16.470> and<00:02:16.680> I<00:02:16.710> think

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
problems as black ops 2 and I think

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.230 
problems as black ops 2 and I think
everyone's<00:02:17.190> going<00:02:17.370> to<00:02:17.430> still<00:02:17.730> get<00:02:17.940> annoyed

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
everyone's going to still get annoyed

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.080 
everyone's going to still get annoyed
with<00:02:18.450> it<00:02:18.600> and<00:02:19.190> but<00:02:20.190> it's<00:02:20.460> in<00:02:20.610> the<00:02:20.700> game<00:02:20.850> what

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
with it and but it's in the game what

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.620 
with it and but it's in the game what
can<00:02:21.240> you<00:02:21.330> do<00:02:21.530> moving<00:02:22.530> on<00:02:22.650> to<00:02:22.680> tier<00:02:23.160> 2<00:02:23.670> and<00:02:24.000> this

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
can you do moving on to tier 2 and this

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.810 
can you do moving on to tier 2 and this
there's<00:02:25.140> some<00:02:25.260> slightly<00:02:25.590> new<00:02:25.860> perks<00:02:26.370> in<00:02:26.610> this

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:26.820 
there's some slightly new perks in this

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:29.390 
there's some slightly new perks in this
tier<00:02:27.090> and<00:02:27.540> hardwired<00:02:28.200> is<00:02:28.380> the<00:02:28.500> first<00:02:28.770> one<00:02:29.100> it's

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
tier and hardwired is the first one it's

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.460 
tier and hardwired is the first one it's
gonna<00:02:29.640> be<00:02:29.790> and<00:02:30.330> it's<00:02:31.020> going<00:02:31.200> to<00:02:31.290> be<00:02:31.350> like

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
gonna be and it's going to be like

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.790 
gonna be and it's going to be like
assassin<00:02:32.040> where<00:02:32.280> you're<00:02:32.580> immune<00:02:32.940> to<00:02:32.970> any<00:02:33.800> MPs

and counter UAVs and scavenger obviously

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:39.920 
and counter UAVs and scavenger obviously
I<00:02:38.610> don't<00:02:38.730> really<00:02:39.060> think<00:02:39.270> I<00:02:39.390> need<00:02:39.540> to<00:02:39.570> tell<00:02:39.810> you

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
I don't really think I need to tell you

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.740 
I don't really think I need to tell you
that<00:02:40.080> one<00:02:40.230> and<00:02:40.580> cold-blooded<00:02:41.580> and<00:02:42.180> you're

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
that one and cold-blooded and you're

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.100 
that one and cold-blooded and you're
resistant<00:02:43.320> to<00:02:43.470> the<00:02:44.090> target<00:02:45.090> and<00:02:45.390> scopes<00:02:45.780> to

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
resistant to the target and scopes to

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.740 
resistant to the target and scopes to
have<00:02:46.260> on<00:02:46.440> some<00:02:46.710> snipers<00:02:47.220> or<00:02:47.420> even<00:02:48.420> some

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
have on some snipers or even some

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.110 
have on some snipers or even some
assault<00:02:49.620> rifles<00:02:50.070> I<00:02:50.220> probably<00:02:50.550> go<00:02:50.730> into<00:02:51.000> the

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
assault rifles I probably go into the

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.670 
assault rifles I probably go into the
attachments<00:02:51.720> that<00:02:51.750> are<00:02:51.870> going<00:02:52.050> to<00:02:52.110> be<00:02:52.230> in<00:02:52.500> the

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
attachments that are going to be in the

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.640 
attachments that are going to be in the
game<00:02:52.860> and<00:02:53.070> maybe<00:02:53.760> in<00:02:53.940> the<00:02:54.030> next<00:02:54.150> video<00:02:54.540> if<00:02:54.810> you

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
game and maybe in the next video if you

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.140 
game and maybe in the next video if you
guys<00:02:55.800> want<00:02:56.130> the<00:02:56.220> video<00:02:56.460> on<00:02:56.580> the<00:02:56.700> attachment

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
guys want the video on the attachment

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.360 
guys want the video on the attachment
because<00:02:57.330> there's<00:02:57.690> so<00:02:58.110> many<00:02:58.410> new<00:02:58.680> attachments

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
because there's so many new attachments

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:02.000 
because there's so many new attachments
in<00:03:00.150> the<00:03:00.210> game<00:03:00.540> and<00:03:00.810> I<00:03:01.470> think<00:03:01.740> you're<00:03:01.860> going<00:03:01.890> to

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
in the game and I think you're going to

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.880 
in the game and I think you're going to
be<00:03:02.070> really<00:03:02.460> really<00:03:02.550> good<00:03:02.670> and<00:03:03.560> toughness<00:03:04.560> this

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
be really really good and toughness this

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:08.090 
be really really good and toughness this
the<00:03:05.160> exact<00:03:05.430> same<00:03:05.700> as<00:03:06.000> flinch<00:03:06.510> and<00:03:06.840> the<00:03:07.830> weapon

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
the exact same as flinch and the weapon

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.430 
the exact same as flinch and the weapon
proficiency<00:03:08.640> in<00:03:08.790> modern<00:03:09.030> warfare<00:03:09.180> 3<00:03:09.420> it<00:03:10.140> just

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
proficiency in modern warfare 3 it just

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.710 
proficiency in modern warfare 3 it just
flinched<00:03:11.010> less<00:03:11.280> when<00:03:11.550> you<00:03:11.640> get<00:03:11.790> shot<00:03:12.090> which<00:03:12.630> i

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
flinched less when you get shot which i

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.810 
flinched less when you get shot which i
think<00:03:12.840> is<00:03:13.020> really<00:03:13.290> really<00:03:13.410> good<00:03:13.680> and<00:03:13.860> but<00:03:14.790> I

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:14.820 
think is really really good and but I

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:17.120 
think is really really good and but I
don't<00:03:15.300> tend<00:03:15.690> to<00:03:15.780> use<00:03:16.020> it<00:03:16.200> that<00:03:16.350> much<00:03:16.380> anymore<00:03:16.770> I

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
don't tend to use it that much anymore I

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:18.770 
don't tend to use it that much anymore I
used<00:03:17.640> it<00:03:17.790> when<00:03:17.880> I<00:03:17.910> wasn't<00:03:18.120> so<00:03:18.300> great<00:03:18.420> modern

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
used it when I wasn't so great modern

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.090 
used it when I wasn't so great modern
warfare<00:03:18.930> 3<00:03:19.140> but<00:03:19.470> now<00:03:19.620> that<00:03:19.830> I've<00:03:19.920> gotten

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
warfare 3 but now that I've gotten

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:21.800 
warfare 3 but now that I've gotten
better<00:03:20.190> at<00:03:20.459> the<00:03:20.580> game<00:03:20.610> I<00:03:20.760> don't<00:03:21.030> tend<00:03:21.570> to<00:03:21.630> use

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
better at the game I don't tend to use

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:24.590 
better at the game I don't tend to use
it<00:03:21.990> that<00:03:22.140> much<00:03:22.170> and<00:03:22.700> fast<00:03:23.700> hands<00:03:24.090> this<00:03:24.360> isn't

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:24.600 
it that much and fast hands this isn't

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.230 
it that much and fast hands this isn't
gonna<00:03:24.720> be<00:03:24.810> like<00:03:25.080> a<00:03:25.250> mastery<00:03:26.250> load<00:03:26.430> it's<00:03:27.000> gonna

final tier and with engineer your is

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.420 
final tier and with engineer your is
basically<00:03:42.840> like<00:03:42.900> stalker<00:03:43.440> and<00:03:43.830> hacker

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 
basically like stalker and hacker

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:46.940 
basically like stalker and hacker
combined<00:03:45.000> and<00:03:45.300> it<00:03:46.080> shows<00:03:46.350> you<00:03:46.500> where<00:03:46.650> all<00:03:46.800> the

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
combined and it shows you where all the

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:49.160 
combined and it shows you where all the
enemy<00:03:47.220> equipment<00:03:47.340> is<00:03:47.790> and<00:03:48.060> it<00:03:48.510> delays<00:03:48.840> them

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:49.170 
enemy equipment is and it delays them

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:52.900 
enemy equipment is and it delays them
and<00:03:49.700> dead<00:03:50.700> silence<00:03:51.240> you<00:03:51.420> move<00:03:51.720> silently<00:03:52.080> and

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:52.910 
and dead silence you move silently and

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:56.030 
and dead silence you move silently and
awareness<00:03:53.910> and<00:03:54.240> enemy<00:03:55.170> movements<00:03:55.830> are

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
awareness and enemy movements are

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.310 
awareness and enemy movements are
enhanced<00:03:56.580> extreme<00:03:57.270> conditioning<00:03:57.930> you<00:03:58.110> can

00:03:58.310 --> 00:03:58.320 
enhanced extreme conditioning you can

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:00.949 
enhanced extreme conditioning you can
sprint<00:03:58.620> for<00:03:58.860> longer<00:03:59.220> tactical<00:03:59.850> mask<00:04:00.090> it

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 
sprint for longer tactical mask it

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:03.050 
sprint for longer tactical mask it
reduces<00:04:01.440> the<00:04:01.590> effect<00:04:01.920> of<00:04:02.040> enemy<00:04:02.370> grenades<00:04:02.760> and

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
reduces the effect of enemy grenades and

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.990 
reduces the effect of enemy grenades and
dexterity<00:04:03.750> you<00:04:04.380> climb<00:04:04.709> faster<00:04:05.280> so<00:04:05.580> and<00:04:05.790> I

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
dexterity you climb faster so and I

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.930 
dexterity you climb faster so and I
definitely<00:04:06.390> think<00:04:06.750> tier<00:04:07.200> 3<00:04:07.830> is<00:04:08.190> the<00:04:08.220> weakest

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:08.940 
definitely think tier 3 is the weakest

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:11.570 
definitely think tier 3 is the weakest
out<00:04:09.120> of<00:04:09.270> all<00:04:09.450> them<00:04:09.630> and<00:04:09.780> I<00:04:10.140> probably<00:04:10.530> won't<00:04:11.190> be

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:11.580 
out of all them and I probably won't be

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:13.310 
out of all them and I probably won't be
using<00:04:11.970> any<00:04:12.300> perks<00:04:12.720> from<00:04:12.840> territory<00:04:13.290> I

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:13.320 
using any perks from territory I

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:15.830 
using any perks from territory I
probably<00:04:13.560> use<00:04:13.830> the<00:04:13.980> wild<00:04:14.280> card<00:04:14.489> and<00:04:14.730> use<00:04:15.720> an

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 
probably use the wild card and use an

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:18.349 
probably use the wild card and use an
extra<00:04:16.200> perk<00:04:16.440> in<00:04:16.650> Tier<00:04:16.890> one<00:04:16.980> probably<00:04:17.669> probably

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:18.359 
extra perk in Tier one probably probably

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:22.310 
extra perk in Tier one probably probably
go<00:04:18.630> with<00:04:18.900> hardline<00:04:19.650> and<00:04:19.950> ghost
