 really wonderful and to say everything 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.719
 extraordinary 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.770
 jean fiÃ©vet from the center of charleroi went 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.770
 immediately on the spot 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:47.789
 you were so sir the commander 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.780
 of the aircraft then in your opinion 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.960
 what happened 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:54.649
 very precisely john monitors quiniou 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.649
 morita prince 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:06.480
 a flower gesture that I can you 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:09.720
 to say is that I met 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:11.010
 a flight of pigeons and this is the only 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.410
 thing that I can declare you for 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:18.030
 the moment and then what happened 

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:18.900
 you felt totally powerless 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:25.310
 of decision 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:25.310
 teach you feel without any possibility 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:38.700
 I prefer to wait until there is a 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.240
 thorough investigation to be able to 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:44.160
 answer this question because 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:47.690
 sir the commander considers himself this 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:50.690
 evening like a real miracle 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:50.690
 Youphil 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:09.540
 but so absolutely he also believes that 

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:12.090
 these miraculous to have been able to land in 

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:14.810
 conditions that would not have 200 hours 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:17.160
 without accident of a third 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:19.200
 the tanks come to you who is the good 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.360
 master of the great charleroi I believe 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.260
 we can say that we have come close to 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.760
 disaster 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:29.460
 really two fingers two fingers 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:32.240
 it's the least we can say could 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:36.030
 have hundreds of victims 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:37.340
 the highway this national highway to 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:41.400
 great circulation 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:42.170
 the shopping center and the hospital of 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.240
 June 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:47.550
 yes but I still shudder and I 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:48.660
 am the girl almost practically five 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:51.540
 minutes after the accident 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:53.610
 we were warned a single arrival and 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:57.030
 I wonder what lesson is going to be able 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:58.950
 shoot all this and I can not bring 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:00.810
 of answer to this question that I am 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.880
 pose and that is still a question that 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.860
 regards the safety of all our 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:06.420
 agglomeration 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:08.130
 but finally there are no casualties and 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:10.470
 it's on board this lake we have to 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:13.200
 congratulate conclusions reflections 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:14.459
 it must come after that this accident 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.050
 is not done I repeat to you none 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:17.850
 victim is all the more amazing 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:19.590
 that when the boeing 737 was 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:21.269
 crushed he still had in his 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:23.340
 tanks sixty thousand liters of 

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:25.260
 kerosene the strongest emotions are 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:26.850
 past but the months that the event 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.769
 in the immediate vicinity of 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:32.000
 the gosselies airport is definitely 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:32.000
 not ready to calm down
