00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.070 

yes<00:00:00.480> so<00:00:01.079> I<00:00:01.410> have<00:00:02.010> one<00:00:02.280> valve<00:00:02.550> out<00:00:03.449> of<00:00:03.629> my<00:00:03.780> super

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:04.080 
yes so I have one valve out of my super

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:05.930 
yes so I have one valve out of my super
coupet<00:00:04.500> they're<00:00:05.100> a<00:00:05.130> little<00:00:05.279> tricky<00:00:05.490> to<00:00:05.700> get

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940 
coupet they're a little tricky to get

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:07.940 
coupet they're a little tricky to get
out<00:00:06.060> so<00:00:06.270> I<00:00:06.299> did<00:00:06.509> one<00:00:06.690> just<00:00:06.899> so<00:00:07.080> I<00:00:07.109> can<00:00:07.410> know<00:00:07.770> how

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
out so I did one just so I can know how

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.509 
out so I did one just so I can know how
to<00:00:08.010> do<00:00:08.160> it<00:00:08.280> show<00:00:09.090> you<00:00:09.150> in<00:00:09.269> the<00:00:09.330> video<00:00:10.519> basically

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
to do it show you in the video basically

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.509 
to do it show you in the video basically
these<00:00:11.730> are<00:00:11.790> the<00:00:11.940> parts<00:00:12.300> you<00:00:12.450> have<00:00:13.219> to<00:00:14.219> hold<00:00:14.400> the

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
these are the parts you have to hold the

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.070 
these are the parts you have to hold the
valve<00:00:14.700> in<00:00:14.910> you<00:00:15.330> got<00:00:15.480> the<00:00:15.509> locks

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
valve in you got the locks

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.060 
valve in you got the locks
pull<00:00:16.379> the<00:00:16.440> retainers<00:00:18.230> you<00:00:19.230> get<00:00:19.350> the<00:00:19.470> top<00:00:19.710> plate

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
pull the retainers you get the top plate

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.140 
pull the retainers you get the top plate
that<00:00:20.430> sits<00:00:20.910> like<00:00:21.150> this<00:00:21.390> and<00:00:22.080> then<00:00:23.090> inside<00:00:24.090> here

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
that sits like this and then inside here

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.890 
that sits like this and then inside here
the<00:00:25.109> valve<00:00:25.320> comes<00:00:25.590> up<00:00:25.740> through<00:00:25.920> here<00:00:26.189> and<00:00:26.900> the

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
the valve comes up through here and the

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.650 
the valve comes up through here and the
locks<00:00:28.140> the<00:00:28.560> retaining<00:00:28.890> lock<00:00:29.130> sit<00:00:29.609> in<00:00:30.060> here<00:00:30.480> and

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
locks the retaining lock sit in here and

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.840 
locks the retaining lock sit in here and
that's<00:00:30.840> what<00:00:30.990> holds<00:00:31.340> the<00:00:32.340> valve<00:00:32.550> in<00:00:32.759> the

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
that's what holds the valve in the

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.459 
that's what holds the valve in the
spring<00:00:33.120> and<00:00:33.270> you<00:00:33.630> can<00:00:33.660> see<00:00:33.899> in<00:00:33.989> the<00:00:34.079> top<00:00:34.260> of<00:00:34.380> the

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
spring and you can see in the top of the

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.160 
spring and you can see in the top of the
valve<00:00:34.680> it's<00:00:35.340> got<00:00:35.640> a<00:00:35.910> whole<00:00:36.660> bunch<00:00:36.809> of<00:00:36.930> grooves

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
valve it's got a whole bunch of grooves

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.639 
valve it's got a whole bunch of grooves
and<00:00:37.530> these<00:00:37.770> locks<00:00:39.110> line<00:00:40.110> up<00:00:40.290> with<00:00:40.500> these

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
and these locks line up with these

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.240 
and these locks line up with these
grooves<00:00:40.980> and<00:00:41.579> that's<00:00:41.910> what<00:00:42.059> holds<00:00:42.360> Thalmann

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:43.250 
grooves and that's what holds Thalmann

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:47.690 
grooves and that's what holds Thalmann
this<00:00:44.250> is<00:00:44.399> your<00:00:44.670> spring<00:00:46.070> this<00:00:47.070> is<00:00:47.219> your<00:00:47.399> valve

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
this is your spring this is your valve

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:56.150 
this is your spring this is your valve
seal<00:00:53.899> that's<00:00:54.899> what<00:00:55.320> your<00:00:55.500> valve<00:00:55.680> seal<00:00:56.010> looks

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
seal that's what your valve seal looks

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:03.520 
seal that's what your valve seal looks
like<00:00:57.500> and<00:00:58.500> that's<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:58.829> valve<00:00:59.039> itself<00:01:01.399> so<00:01:02.399> I

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.530 
like and that's the valve itself so I

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.539 
like and that's the valve itself so I
have<00:01:04.530> to<00:01:04.650> do<00:01:04.769> a<00:01:04.799> whole<00:01:04.949> bunch<00:01:05.129> more<00:01:05.220> of<00:01:05.430> these

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
have to do a whole bunch more of these

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.969 
have to do a whole bunch more of these
they're<00:01:06.390> pretty<00:01:06.659> tricky<00:01:07.260> on<00:01:07.439> this<00:01:07.560> car<00:01:07.799> for

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
they're pretty tricky on this car for

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.770 
they're pretty tricky on this car for
whatever<00:01:08.130> reason<00:01:08.549> but<00:01:09.119> I<00:01:09.240> figured<00:01:09.540> out<00:01:09.600> what

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
whatever reason but I figured out what

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.170 
whatever reason but I figured out what
the<00:01:09.810> trick<00:01:10.049> was<00:01:10.320> I'll<00:01:10.500> show<00:01:10.710> ya<00:01:10.860> so<00:01:11.610> before<00:01:12.060> we

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
the trick was I'll show ya so before we

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.480 
the trick was I'll show ya so before we
get<00:01:12.299> going<00:01:12.360> here<00:01:12.689> we<00:01:13.500> have<00:01:13.619> a<00:01:13.650> couple<00:01:13.890> types<00:01:14.250> of

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
get going here we have a couple types of

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.370 
get going here we have a couple types of
valve<00:01:14.700> spring<00:01:15.030> compressors<00:01:15.659> this<00:01:16.080> is<00:01:16.229> the

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
valve spring compressors this is the

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:17.960 
valve spring compressors this is the
tool<00:01:16.560> used<00:01:16.770> to<00:01:16.890> compress<00:01:17.189> a<00:01:17.310> spring<00:01:17.430> to<00:01:17.820> take

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
tool used to compress a spring to take

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.880 
tool used to compress a spring to take
the<00:01:18.119> valve<00:01:18.330> did<00:01:18.990> take<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.290> spring<00:01:19.530> off<00:01:19.680> so<00:01:19.830> you

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
the valve did take the spring off so you

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.499 
the valve did take the spring off so you
can<00:01:19.950> get<00:01:20.040> the<00:01:20.189> valve<00:01:20.400> out<00:01:20.580> you<00:01:21.240> have<00:01:21.330> one

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
can get the valve out you have one

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.960 
can get the valve out you have one
that's<00:01:21.659> like<00:01:21.840> this<00:01:22.020> these<00:01:22.830> spring<00:01:23.250> clips<00:01:23.790> in

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
that's like this these spring clips in

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.969 
that's like this these spring clips in
here<00:01:24.000> this<00:01:24.780> pushes<00:01:25.259> down<00:01:25.439> on<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:25.650> spring

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
here this pushes down on the spring

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.890 
here this pushes down on the spring
compresses<00:01:26.520> it<00:01:26.820> and<00:01:26.850> you<00:01:27.210> twist<00:01:27.509> it<00:01:27.659> by<00:01:27.840> this

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
compresses it and you twist it by this

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.219 
compresses it and you twist it by this
handle<00:01:28.350> or<00:01:29.310> you<00:01:29.850> have<00:01:30.030> this<00:01:30.180> seat<00:01:30.720> clamp<00:01:30.960> one

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
handle or you have this seat clamp one

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.770 
handle or you have this seat clamp one
and<00:01:31.409> what<00:01:32.280> this<00:01:32.400> does<00:01:32.640> is<00:01:32.850> this<00:01:32.970> just<00:01:33.390> goes<00:01:33.600> to

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
and what this does is this just goes to

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.300 
and what this does is this just goes to
the<00:01:33.900> this<00:01:34.200> goes<00:01:34.380> on<00:01:34.560> the<00:01:34.590> bottom<00:01:34.950> of<00:01:35.009> the<00:01:35.100> valve

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
the this goes on the bottom of the valve

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.249 
the this goes on the bottom of the valve
so<00:01:35.579> the<00:01:36.000> part<00:01:36.540> of<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:36.689> valve<00:01:36.869> that's<00:01:37.049> in<00:01:37.170> the

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
so the part of the valve that's in the

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.469 
so the part of the valve that's in the
cylinder<00:01:37.680> this<00:01:38.400> sits<00:01:38.909> right<00:01:39.060> in<00:01:39.150> the<00:01:39.210> center

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
cylinder this sits right in the center

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.719 
cylinder this sits right in the center
that<00:01:39.659> this<00:01:40.619> goes<00:01:40.860> on<00:01:41.009> the<00:01:41.130> top<00:01:41.310> of<00:01:41.460> the<00:01:41.549> spring

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
that this goes on the top of the spring

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.389 
that this goes on the top of the spring
and<00:01:41.909> you<00:01:42.000> can<00:01:42.180> adjust<00:01:42.270> it<00:01:42.689> to<00:01:43.259> whatever<00:01:44.189> size

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
and you can adjust it to whatever size

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.880 
and you can adjust it to whatever size
of<00:01:44.820> spring<00:01:45.030> is<00:01:45.210> and<00:01:45.509> then<00:01:45.630> you<00:01:45.750> can<00:01:45.780> press<00:01:46.680> this

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
of spring is and then you can press this

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.950 
of spring is and then you can press this
handle<00:01:47.250> down<00:01:47.399> and<00:01:47.610> it<00:01:47.670> supposed<00:01:48.390> to<00:01:48.479> compress

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
handle down and it supposed to compress

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.780 
handle down and it supposed to compress
the<00:01:49.140> spring<00:01:49.350> I<00:01:49.560> hate<00:01:49.920> this<00:01:50.159> type<00:01:50.430> this<00:01:50.610> is<00:01:50.759> the

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
the spring I hate this type this is the

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.580 
the spring I hate this type this is the
type<00:01:50.880> of<00:01:51.030> used<00:01:51.270> on<00:01:51.420> the<00:01:51.509> truck<00:01:51.750> it<00:01:52.439> was<00:01:52.530> a

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
type of used on the truck it was a

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.010 
type of used on the truck it was a
twenty<00:01:52.920> dollar<00:01:53.070> craftsman<00:01:53.610> one<00:01:53.790> and<00:01:54.060> it's

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
twenty dollar craftsman one and it's

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.709 
twenty dollar craftsman one and it's
easily<00:01:55.860> broken<00:01:56.520> because<00:01:56.670> it's<00:01:56.850> just<00:01:57.060> very

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
easily broken because it's just very

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.810 
easily broken because it's just very
cheap<00:01:58.020> this<00:01:58.649> is<00:01:58.710> the<00:01:58.979> better<00:01:59.130> type<00:01:59.399> of<00:01:59.520> London

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
cheap this is the better type of London

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.490 
cheap this is the better type of London
yet<00:01:59.969> however<00:02:00.750> the<00:02:01.350> one<00:02:01.500> on<00:02:01.619> the<00:02:01.680> truck<00:02:01.920> you

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 
yet however the one on the truck you

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.359 
yet however the one on the truck you
couldn't<00:02:04.500> use<00:02:04.649> this<00:02:04.829> type<00:02:05.130> because<00:02:05.340> the

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
couldn't use this type because the

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.749 
couldn't use this type because the
camshaft<00:02:06.060> was<00:02:06.240> in<00:02:06.360> a<00:02:06.420> way<00:02:06.570> so<00:02:07.399> they<00:02:08.399> make<00:02:08.610> other

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
camshaft was in a way so they make other

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.520 
camshaft was in a way so they make other
types<00:02:08.910> but<00:02:09.239> this<00:02:09.569> is<00:02:09.690> what<00:02:09.840> I<00:02:09.869> had<00:02:10.140> so<00:02:10.410> that's

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
types but this is what I had so that's

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:11.589 
types but this is what I had so that's
what<00:02:10.739> I<00:02:10.770> used

00:02:11.589 --> 00:02:11.599 
what I used

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:13.479 
what I used
anyway<00:02:12.260> you<00:02:12.409> can<00:02:12.530> see<00:02:12.560> that<00:02:12.860> I<00:02:12.890> have<00:02:13.099> one<00:02:13.340> of

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:13.489 
anyway you can see that I have one of

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:15.429 
anyway you can see that I have one of
them<00:02:13.610> out<00:02:13.790> this<00:02:14.599> is<00:02:14.719> what<00:02:14.870> the<00:02:15.049> package<00:02:15.409> looks

00:02:15.429 --> 00:02:15.439 
them out this is what the package looks

00:02:15.439 --> 00:02:19.509 
them out this is what the package looks
like<00:02:15.799> together<00:02:16.239> see<00:02:17.239> how<00:02:17.390> the<00:02:18.159> these<00:02:19.159> are<00:02:19.370> the

00:02:19.509 --> 00:02:19.519 
like together see how the these are the

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:22.089 
like together see how the these are the
locks<00:02:20.450> and<00:02:20.870> then<00:02:21.260> you<00:02:21.409> can<00:02:21.560> see<00:02:21.709> the<00:02:21.829> spring

00:02:22.089 --> 00:02:22.099 
locks and then you can see the spring

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:23.530 
locks and then you can see the spring
and<00:02:22.400> you<00:02:22.489> can<00:02:22.670> see<00:02:22.819> how<00:02:22.909> it's<00:02:23.060> all<00:02:23.180> together

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
and you can see how it's all together

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.289 
and you can see how it's all together
and<00:02:23.810> how<00:02:23.959> it's<00:02:24.500> very<00:02:24.739> tight<00:02:25.040> in<00:02:25.189> there<00:02:25.909> holds

00:02:26.289 --> 00:02:26.299 
and how it's very tight in there holds

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:30.699 
and how it's very tight in there holds
the<00:02:26.450> valve<00:02:27.439> against<00:02:28.840> you<00:02:29.840> no<00:02:29.930> holds<00:02:30.230> valve<00:02:30.470> up

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:30.709 
the valve against you no holds valve up

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:31.960 
the valve against you no holds valve up
against<00:02:31.099> the<00:02:31.189> top<00:02:31.400> of<00:02:31.549> the<00:02:31.609> head

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
against the top of the head

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:33.250 
against the top of the head
now<00:02:32.090> these<00:02:32.209> heads<00:02:32.450> are<00:02:32.569> very<00:02:32.750> dirty<00:02:33.019> they've

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
now these heads are very dirty they've

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.199 
now these heads are very dirty they've
got<00:02:33.409> to<00:02:33.500> get<00:02:33.590> cleaned<00:02:33.890> but<00:02:34.640> you<00:02:34.849> can<00:02:35.030> tell

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:35.209 
got to get cleaned but you can tell

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:37.449 
got to get cleaned but you can tell
these<00:02:35.390> are<00:02:35.540> super<00:02:35.840> coop<00:02:36.019> heads<00:02:36.290> because<00:02:36.709> SC<00:02:37.340> is

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:37.459 
these are super coop heads because SC is

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:40.720 
these are super coop heads because SC is
imprinted<00:02:37.879> into<00:02:38.150> them<00:02:38.620> and<00:02:39.620> therefore<00:02:40.040> the<00:02:40.310> sx

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
imprinted into them and therefore the sx

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:45.910 
imprinted into them and therefore the sx
3.8<00:02:42.129> that's<00:02:43.129> the<00:02:43.280> part<00:02:43.549> number<00:02:44.680> so<00:02:45.680> you<00:02:45.739> take

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
3.8 that's the part number so you take

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.750 
3.8 that's the part number so you take
your<00:02:45.950> spring<00:02:46.280> compressor<00:02:47.290> and<00:02:48.340> you<00:02:49.340> push<00:02:49.609> it

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
your spring compressor and you push it

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.750 
your spring compressor and you push it
over<00:02:50.030> the<00:02:50.060> spring<00:02:50.959> like<00:02:51.139> this<00:02:51.609> so<00:02:52.609> it's

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
over the spring like this so it's

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:58.149 
over the spring like this so it's
latched<00:02:53.000> on<00:02:54.189> make<00:02:55.189> sure<00:02:55.400> it's<00:02:55.549> in<00:02:57.010> all<00:02:58.010> the<00:02:58.040> way

00:02:58.149 --> 00:02:58.159 
latched on make sure it's in all the way

00:02:58.159 --> 00:03:00.670 
latched on make sure it's in all the way
it's<00:02:58.459> a<00:02:58.519> little<00:02:58.549> tricky<00:02:59.109> so<00:03:00.109> now<00:03:00.260> I<00:03:00.290> have<00:03:00.470> it<00:03:00.560> on

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
it's a little tricky so now I have it on

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:06.729 
it's a little tricky so now I have it on
it's<00:03:01.040> nice<00:03:01.189> and<00:03:01.400> snug<00:03:05.290> all<00:03:06.290> right<00:03:06.409> so<00:03:06.560> I've<00:03:06.709> got

00:03:06.729 --> 00:03:06.739 
it's nice and snug all right so I've got

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:10.179 
it's nice and snug all right so I've got
one<00:03:07.129> of<00:03:07.250> the<00:03:08.200> retaining<00:03:09.200> clips<00:03:09.470> out<00:03:09.739> here<00:03:10.040> you

00:03:10.179 --> 00:03:10.189 
one of the retaining clips out here you

00:03:10.189 --> 00:03:12.699 
one of the retaining clips out here you
can<00:03:10.310> see<00:03:10.549> in<00:03:11.239> there<00:03:11.510> now<00:03:12.169> the<00:03:12.200> trick<00:03:12.680> is

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:12.709 
can see in there now the trick is

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:14.979 
can see in there now the trick is
because<00:03:13.579> this<00:03:13.730> motor<00:03:13.939> had<00:03:14.120> almost<00:03:14.269> 200,000

00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:14.989 
because this motor had almost 200,000

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:17.770 
because this motor had almost 200,000
miles<00:03:15.139> on<00:03:15.379> it<00:03:15.439> when<00:03:15.620> I<00:03:15.650> took<00:03:16.069> it<00:03:16.159> apart<00:03:16.400> or<00:03:16.780> the

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:17.780 
miles on it when I took it apart or the

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:21.009 
miles on it when I took it apart or the
car<00:03:17.959> took<00:03:18.139> it<00:03:18.290> out<00:03:18.379> of<00:03:19.449> there<00:03:20.449> kind<00:03:20.750> of<00:03:20.840> stuck

00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:21.019 
car took it out of there kind of stuck

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:22.719 
car took it out of there kind of stuck
together<00:03:21.169> it<00:03:21.500> hasn't<00:03:21.769> run<00:03:21.889> in<00:03:21.919> a<00:03:22.069> while<00:03:22.220> so<00:03:22.489> I

00:03:22.719 --> 00:03:22.729 
together it hasn't run in a while so I

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:25.059 
together it hasn't run in a while so I
had<00:03:22.879> to<00:03:23.000> actually<00:03:23.299> tip<00:03:23.479> the<00:03:23.720> head<00:03:24.349> tap<00:03:24.829> the

00:03:25.059 --> 00:03:25.069 
had to actually tip the head tap the

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:27.610 
had to actually tip the head tap the
valve<00:03:25.280> and<00:03:25.810> break<00:03:26.810> them<00:03:27.019> loose<00:03:27.199> a<00:03:27.379> little<00:03:27.440> bit

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:27.620 
valve and break them loose a little bit

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:29.409 
valve and break them loose a little bit
because<00:03:27.829> they<00:03:27.979> were<00:03:28.040> kind<00:03:28.250> of<00:03:28.310> not<00:03:28.940> rusted

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:29.419 
because they were kind of not rusted

00:03:29.419 --> 00:03:30.430 
because they were kind of not rusted
together<00:03:29.540> but<00:03:29.900> they<00:03:30.019> were<00:03:30.079> just<00:03:30.229> stuck

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:30.440 
together but they were just stuck

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:33.250 
together but they were just stuck
together<00:03:30.620> after<00:03:31.069> being<00:03:31.280> you<00:03:31.729> know<00:03:31.819> that<00:03:32.260> tight

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:33.260 
together after being you know that tight

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.309 
together after being you know that tight
in<00:03:33.440> there<00:03:33.620> for<00:03:33.769> so<00:03:33.919> long<00:03:34.159> so<00:03:34.750> the<00:03:35.750> next<00:03:35.930> part<00:03:36.229> is

00:03:36.309 --> 00:03:36.319 
in there for so long so the next part is

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:37.659 
in there for so long so the next part is
to<00:03:36.379> get<00:03:36.590> the<00:03:36.680> other<00:03:36.799> side<00:03:37.010> out<00:03:37.190> and<00:03:37.220> then<00:03:37.459> it'll

00:03:37.659 --> 00:03:37.669 
to get the other side out and then it'll

00:03:37.669 --> 00:03:40.659 
to get the other side out and then it'll
come<00:03:37.849> apart<00:03:37.940> just<00:03:38.419> like<00:03:38.690> the<00:03:39.620> the<00:03:40.519> one<00:03:40.639> I

00:03:40.659 --> 00:03:40.669 
come apart just like the the one I

00:03:40.669 --> 00:03:44.219 
come apart just like the the one I
showed<00:03:40.909> you<00:03:42.069> actually<00:03:43.069> I<00:03:43.099> stumbled<00:03:43.639> across

00:03:44.219 --> 00:03:44.229 
showed you actually I stumbled across

00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:46.629 
showed you actually I stumbled across
some<00:03:45.229> pictures<00:03:45.590> of<00:03:45.769> this<00:03:45.919> motor<00:03:46.190> when<00:03:46.400> I<00:03:46.430> took

00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:46.639 
some pictures of this motor when I took

00:03:46.639 --> 00:03:48.430 
some pictures of this motor when I took
it<00:03:46.760> apart<00:03:47.030> and<00:03:47.269> when<00:03:47.659> I<00:03:47.690> brought<00:03:47.930> it<00:03:48.079> home<00:03:48.169> etc

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:48.440 
it apart and when I brought it home etc

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:51.699 
it apart and when I brought it home etc
so<00:03:49.310> I<00:03:49.340> will<00:03:49.790> try<00:03:50.359> and<00:03:50.540> post<00:03:50.780> those<00:03:51.019> either<00:03:51.349> on

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:51.709 
so I will try and post those either on

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:53.770 
so I will try and post those either on
my<00:03:51.979> website<00:03:52.430> or<00:03:52.459> throw<00:03:52.849> a<00:03:52.879> slideshow<00:03:53.449> in<00:03:53.629> I

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:14.750 
one of these Springs compressed what to

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:17.020 
one of these Springs compressed what to
do<00:04:14.870> to<00:04:15.019> get<00:04:15.169> the<00:04:15.319> locking<00:04:16.039> or<00:04:16.579> the<00:04:16.729> retainer

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:22.660 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:24.760 

until<00:04:23.660> there's<00:04:23.810> enough<00:04:24.020> play<00:04:24.290> in<00:04:24.440> the<00:04:24.530> valve

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:24.770 
until there's enough play in the valve
