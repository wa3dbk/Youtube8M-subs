this<00:00:15.059> one<00:00:15.269> is<00:00:15.480> in<00:00:15.690> two<00:00:15.990> minutes<00:00:16.320> and<00:00:16.529> 6<00:00:17.039> seconds

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
this one is in two minutes and 6 seconds

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.490 
this one is in two minutes and 6 seconds
if<00:00:17.699> you<00:00:17.850> count<00:00:18.240> it<00:00:18.300> from<00:00:18.510> first<00:00:18.750> kill<00:00:18.990> to<00:00:19.320> last

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
if you count it from first kill to last

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.320 
if you count it from first kill to last
kill<00:00:19.770> and<00:00:20.010> it's<00:00:20.609> two<00:00:20.789> minutes<00:00:20.910> and<00:00:21.119> nine

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
kill and it's two minutes and nine

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.230 
kill and it's two minutes and nine
seconds<00:00:21.840> i<00:00:22.020> believe<00:00:22.260> if<00:00:22.410> you<00:00:22.439> counted<00:00:22.830> from

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:23.240 
seconds i believe if you counted from

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.670 
seconds i believe if you counted from
movie<00:00:24.240> would<00:00:24.420> be<00:00:24.449> game<00:00:24.689> to<00:00:24.720> SQL<00:00:25.260> so<00:00:25.380> not<00:00:25.529> really

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
movie would be game to SQL so not really

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.920 
movie would be game to SQL so not really
much<00:00:25.830> of<00:00:25.890> a<00:00:26.039> difference<00:00:26.310> there<00:00:26.369> and<00:00:26.820> if<00:00:27.810> we

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
much of a difference there and if we

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.630 
much of a difference there and if we
could<00:00:28.019> try<00:00:28.170> to<00:00:28.230> hit<00:00:28.470> 1,000<00:00:29.279> likes<00:00:29.400> on<00:00:29.519> this

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
could try to hit 1,000 likes on this
