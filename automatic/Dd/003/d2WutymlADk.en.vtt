00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:09.130
 well you see already the golden jars many 

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:11.950
 golden things ferrero rocher that 

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:13.750
 we will be working the reality is that 

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:16.360
 I have a party inside nothing and I want 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:18.400
 do everything with golden so started 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:20.080
 with the theme in the ferrero rocher os 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:22.300
 stop the past video if you want that 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:24.010
 did more as he had said that if we 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:26.170
 let's continue with ferrero chocolates 

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:29.740
 rocher today we have another monex video 

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:32.379
 see today we are going to make this bouquet 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:35.350
 like this bouquet with chocolates super easy 

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:37.089
 to do is a great bouquet to give 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:40.089
 I remember at any party or 

00:00:37.089 --> 00:00:42.159
 just to tell someone thank you 

00:00:40.089 --> 00:00:45.249
 well let's see how we do it 

00:00:42.159 --> 00:00:46.899
 I already say very easy to do to do it 

00:00:45.249 --> 00:00:49.809
 we're going to need cork balls these 

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:52.210
 they are 100 millimeters 10 centimeters 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:53.859
 diameter is valid then you can use the 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:56.229
 of any size the larger 

00:00:53.859 --> 00:00:58.899
 Well, you'll need more chocolates later 

00:00:56.229 --> 00:01:00.519
 we will need skewers or sticks 

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:02.860
 ice cream depending on whether the bouquet 

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:05.700
 you want shorter or longer 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:08.440
 let's also use aluminum foil 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.510
 golden though you can use any other 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:13.750
 rope will give you some ideas 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:15.670
 and then we need a pinocchio paper or 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:19.120
 decree of those who ask for a little 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:21.510
 to wrap our bouquet we will see 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:21.510
 How do we do it 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:27.090
 let's start by covering our ball 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.650
 cork with golden aluminum foil because 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.090
 we do it this way, well, in case 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.580
 they are hollow when we put the 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:35.010
 chocolates so you do not notice much 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:38.580
 you can do it with silver paper paint 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:40.560
 the ball or use any paper 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:42.930
 pinocho that is a little yellow 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.810
 golden we put a little bit of 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.850
 hot tail on the ball so that it 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.530
 the paper is more stuck and what we are going 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.540
 to do is lining it a couple of times what 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.250
 we lined twice so that when 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.979
 take the chocolates that we are going to paste 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.990
 above our foil does not 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:00.479
 you see the cork ball see the other 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.369
 from below good is more less is that 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.970
 be a little stronger, well, nothing 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.970
 we lined 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:13.879
 well now let's do the part below 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.799
 the bouquet is where we are going to 

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:18.290
 grab for that we nail a skewer 

00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:20.060
 in our ball we take it out we put it 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.549
 with the hot one and we put it back in 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.639
 the hole we had made 

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:27.409
 this then at least with 6 skewers 

00:02:24.639 --> 00:02:29.180
 If we want a shorter bouquet, 

00:02:27.409 --> 00:02:32.359
 instead of using skewers what we do 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:34.189
 use ice cream sticks you see we put the 

00:02:32.359 --> 00:02:35.329
 skewer in different holes then you 

00:02:34.189 --> 00:02:37.370
 we will put with the hot and the 

00:02:35.329 --> 00:02:40.000
 we will go back through the hole that 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:40.000
 we had done 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:16.430
 once we have all the sticks 

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:18.830
 we're going to start by putting the 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:21.260
 chocolates for that we put the first one in 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:22.820
 the center of the ball we're just going to put 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:26.000
 chocolates let's say in the middle of the 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:27.740
 We put you one there and 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.630
 we are putting chocolates now around 

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:32.970
 of that first one that we have put 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:35.880
 We put the chocolates with cappuccino 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:38.040
 brown you can also take them out but as 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:40.380
 the chocolate is placed in the capsule on 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:44.540
 cap or in the capsule then 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:44.540
 nothing happens because it stays stuck 

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:09.720
 Well, we already have a first row 

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:11.700
 in which we have six chocolates and one 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:15.060
 central now let's put another six 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:17.190
 beige chocolates putting them in the holes 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:18.750
 of the first six I know that they are 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:21.000
 free holes you could have put 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:22.800
 many more but man we do not want either 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.720
 spend a whole box 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:27.470
 this depends on each one I say that with 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:29.910
 13 chocolates is the bouquet very apaÃ±adito 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:32.400
 Well, nothing we put those that I say 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:34.700
 and you see how it looks is pretty good 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:37.770
 so now what we do is 

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:41.010
 we cover the whole bouquet first with the 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:43.140
 golden aluminum foil but had 

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:45.000
 Now nothing happens, I like it because 

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:47.160
 so then I push it a little and it 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.440
 disguise the gaps 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:50.970
 once we finish with this color what 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:52.520
 what we do is with our pinocho paper 

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:55.050
 which we have decided that we want 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:57.450
 we bend a little inwards and 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:05:00.050
 wrap the bouquet again by gluing it 

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:00.050
 with hot glue 

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:27.539
 all right 

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:33.460
 Y 

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:33.460
 here 

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:50.850
 Y 

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:57.010
 it may happen that one of the chocolates 

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:59.500
 that are forming our bouquet is not 

00:05:57.010 --> 00:06:01.480
 completely stuck to the paper to the capsule 

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:03.970
 in that case if you see that someone moves 

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:06.160
 more than normal what you can do is 

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:07.540
 stick it with a little hot glue if 

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:10.480
 put some hot glue you stick 

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:13.420
 a little more the candy to the good capsule 

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:15.250
 so let's continue to decorate a 

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:16.720
 little more this role than as we said 

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:18.790
 It was a little elastic, because we stretched it 

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:21.820
 all that is the edge so that 

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:23.830
 be wavy and then once 

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:26.410
 we do this that is more cute just us 

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:29.890
 it is necessary to put a bow we are going to put a 

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:31.930
 tie on the bottom of the bouquet you see 

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:34.260
 what monkey is left but let's put the 

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:34.260
 tie 

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:41.560
 Well, it's already been superchulo 

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:41.560
 the ramito 

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:47.180
 the next day we are going to make another bouquet 

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:48.770
 a different range that is also going to 

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:51.320
 love I hope you liked it 

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:53.750
 these ideas if you want to see more go to this 

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:56.500
 playlist I wait for you in the 

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:56.500
 next tutorial
