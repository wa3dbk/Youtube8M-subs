00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.069
 will all be boys what is talking to you and 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.299
 welcome to this short video 

00:00:04.069 --> 00:00:08.400
 first of all I wish you a happy Easter 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.349
 because today is Easter day e 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.570
 I wanted to do a special video but 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.580
 unfortunately I did not succeed 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.680
 I tried in various ways and I wanted to 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.510
 make you an episode an hour long of this 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.170
 career with the villareal but look at that 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.170
 What happen 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:27.240
 according to me something is wrong then 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:30.359
 calendar then if we were not wrong 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.210
 arrived here at the last episode I have 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.500
 recorded all other matches 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:36.570
 victories in the league yesterday in first 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.149
 victory yesterday two to zero at random 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.320
 completely gave me all right with 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:48.059
 the game really 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:50.640
 I was lucky 00 30 lost 0 to 0 2 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:01:00.510
 at 1 then we go back a 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:01:05.659
 moment 0 0 1 1 1 to 0 10 lost 0 to 0 1 a 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:07.530
 1 then we have very few goals made 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:09.000
 four games if I'm not mistaken 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.610
 from the beginning of the season part 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.100
 they are finished 0 0 then you can understand 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.930
 good that I break the boxes a bit 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.820
 play legend if these are i 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.890
 results is true is my failure 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.530
 personal what I'm about to announce 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:25.710
 to you but I have no intention of 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:28.140
 continue this legend career 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.450
 so the options are two yes 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.210
 they would pose right now but I already have 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.860
 decided the first would be to continue 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.909
 this career lowered the difficulty 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.259
 sample 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:40.250
 the second would be to interrupt 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:43.560
 focus only on the one with the samp 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:45.390
 the solution I propose this time is 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.530
 that of interrupting this career 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.759
 because I noticed you didn't 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.520
 as passionate as the others 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:54.390
 maybe I was the one who dropped it 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:56.729
 Video quality can be the phone 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.110
 what is giving a little bother ok can 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:01.100
 be very well that it was me a 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:03.899
 drop the quality of the videos for a moment 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.100
 and I'm sorry if that's how they still have it 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:07.200
 since the one with the samp a comes 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.729
 much more followed accordingly with by 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.370
 now on I will only continue this 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.480
 until the end of building 15 or better up 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.459
 at the end of that career 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:17.010
 so much will take some more 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:18.450
 in short, nothing was just for 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.459
 alert you to everything 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.750
 I thank you forecast and I wait for you 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:22.709
 to the next episode of the career with 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.190
 the samp 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:25.190
 Hi everyone
