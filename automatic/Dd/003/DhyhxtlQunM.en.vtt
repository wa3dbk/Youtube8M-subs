 [music] 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.010
 if a 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:11.450
 and even this is also a parsing 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:14.430
 and our first chord will be chord e 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:19.399
 middle finger set on 5 string 2 frets 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.399
 and nameless on the fourth string too 2 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.740
 chord e then the next chord c 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:30.100
 pointers to the second string 1 lat 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:33.659
 on the fourth tried and nameless on 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.659
 fifth string 3 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:40.549
 code c the third chord is called am. we 

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:46.570
 just swap the ring finger on 

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:46.570
 third string 2 fret 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:55.649
 and the last chord h7 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:58.890
 index finger on 4 strings 1 medium 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:02.280
 on the 5 string 2 fret nameless on the third 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:05.180
 string 2 and the little finger on the first string 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:08.260
 also second varnish 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:08.260
 your so 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:13.560
 a n h7 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.720
 I played her brute force 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:24.240
 but 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:28.210
 [music] 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:32.690
 busting doesn't sound but is done like this 

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:33.980
 6 countries and then 3 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:37.569
 and then 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:39.780
 first and second strings are extracted together 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:42.319
 then again 3 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.550
 6 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:45.190
 21 place 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:51.060
 [music] 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:51.060
 this brute is called foursome 6 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:56.650
 and each chord has its own bass 

00:02:53.740 --> 00:03:00.010
 the string is what my string is 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:03.990
 extract 1 that is the sixth 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.990
 Lunging I told them 6 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:10.250
 [music] 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:13.400
 give a chord c then play 5 at last and 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:15.270
 bass string 5 5 the rest 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.610
 continues that is 

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:18.270
 yours 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:23.570
 [music] 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:23.570
 first play 6 3 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.400
 these 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:31.850
 And I also have a 5 string card 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:38.900
 I have a h7 chord too 5 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:46.390
 2 and the first string in honey 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:46.390
 fuck here first 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:52.259
 [music] 

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:56.319
 but 

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:07.640
 [music] 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:07.640
 and you can slowly play and learn to sing 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:12.840
 there is 

00:04:17.089 --> 00:04:20.060
 [music] 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:22.930
 and 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:22.930
 Yes 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:26.120
 [music] 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:33.110
 [music] 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:43.569
 Yes 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:46.990
 when we retrieve our brute force 6 3 in 1 

00:04:43.569 --> 00:04:49.330
 when we extract the third string at the end 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:53.439
 before moving on to the next chord 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:59.610
 we can play it open exactly nowhere 

00:04:53.439 --> 00:04:59.610
 don't get stuck for example i'm playing chord 6 

00:05:01.409 --> 00:05:07.920
 when we are 21 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:10.800
 This is the next card to remove it. 

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:13.670
 so without any chord that is here 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:13.670
 honour 

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:18.740
 five 

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:25.040
 I can already let go of the third chord all 

00:05:22.039 --> 00:05:27.100
 same country and here too 5 

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:29.460
 [music] 

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:30.700
 five 

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:32.500
 mother 

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:36.720
 it will be easier for you to rearrange 

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:36.720
 chord and fast 

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:40.460
 and 

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:50.360
 [music] 

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:52.789
 but that sort of thing all the mod lesson 

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:55.060
 learn to play this song and you will 

00:05:52.789 --> 00:05:58.039
 kill people subscribe to the channel 

00:05:55.060 --> 00:06:00.319
