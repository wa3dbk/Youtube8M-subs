it's all about trying to give the animal
the<00:02:23.310> fish<00:02:23.640> we<00:02:23.820> work<00:02:24.000> with<00:02:24.209> the<00:02:24.300> best<00:02:24.480> possible

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
the fish we work with the best possible

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.550 
the fish we work with the best possible
like<00:02:25.110> we<00:02:25.290> can<00:02:25.590> and<00:02:26.540> the<00:02:27.540> byproduct<00:02:28.170> of<00:02:28.260> that<00:02:28.410> of

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
like we can and the byproduct of that of

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.400 
like we can and the byproduct of that of
course<00:02:28.680> is<00:02:28.830> that<00:02:29.100> they<00:02:29.250> returned<00:02:29.640> to<00:02:29.850> us<00:02:29.880> a

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 
course is that they returned to us a

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:32.900 
course is that they returned to us a
whole<00:02:31.410> series<00:02:31.650> of<00:02:31.830> things<00:02:31.950> they<00:02:32.430> grow<00:02:32.640> well

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
whole series of things they grow well

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:36.640 
whole series of things they grow well
they<00:02:33.720> look<00:02:33.959> healthy<00:02:34.140> and<00:02:34.620> they<00:02:34.920> taste<00:02:35.160> good

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
they look healthy and they taste good

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.080 
they look healthy and they taste good
what<00:02:37.650> I<00:02:37.680> would<00:02:37.920> hope<00:02:38.130> you<00:02:38.580> would<00:02:38.730> see<00:02:38.910> because

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
what I would hope you would see because

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:40.760 
what I would hope you would see because
of<00:02:39.630> the<00:02:39.720> way<00:02:39.840> we<00:02:39.870> farm<00:02:40.230> is<00:02:40.470> a<00:02:40.500> greater

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:40.770 
of the way we farm is a greater

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:43.610 
of the way we farm is a greater
biodiversity<00:02:41.550> so<00:02:41.820> I<00:02:42.450> should<00:02:42.930> be<00:02:43.110> able<00:02:43.230> to<00:02:43.440> show

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
biodiversity so I should be able to show

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.210 
biodiversity so I should be able to show
you<00:02:43.680> seals<00:02:44.070> harems<00:02:45.650> diversity<00:02:46.650> of<00:02:46.680> seabirds

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220
