00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:01.279 
further whereas if I have my thumb up
here<00:04:58.760> it's<00:04:59.760> quite<00:05:00.090> awkward<00:05:00.270> to<00:05:00.599> play<00:05:00.840> so<00:05:01.229> you

00:05:01.279 --> 00:05:01.289 
here it's quite awkward to play so you

00:05:01.289 --> 00:05:03.790 
here it's quite awkward to play so you
want<00:05:01.590> to<00:05:01.680> get<00:05:01.800> your<00:05:01.919> head<00:05:02.099> in<00:05:02.280> a<00:05:02.340> good<00:05:02.520> position
