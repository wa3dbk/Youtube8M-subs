00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 look and I love you and I give everything for 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.400
 you who have recorded this video to the 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:06.870
 once the previous one and I have changed the 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.080
 jacket so it does not get cold 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.080
 thumbnails 

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:20.840
 and the year is over and as is usually the case 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:23.570
 frequent on these dates I will make a 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:25.160
 top-ten of my best readings of 2014 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:28.730
 but I'm going to do it a little bit my way 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:31.160
 I like to order the readings from better to 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:33.649
 worse or worse to better to whatever it is so 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.720
 I'm just going to say my 10 best 

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:37.399
 2014 readings by the order in which 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:39.140
 I've read them beginning with a book that 

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:41.149
 I do not have here and it's about the 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:43.310
 steven king's glow is a book 

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:45.020
 that I have for years because I did 

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:47.030
 a collection of more than 40 of his books 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:48.560
 and I still have not read it but I'm going with 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:51.080
 calm this year I had to read the 

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:53.240
 glow and I really liked it is a 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:54.829
 of the best works I've read of him 

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:56.810
 and I loved the law 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:58.670
 shortly after I read his second part he did not 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:00.770
 It's so good but I still liked it a lot 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:02.540
 also my next reading does not 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:04.970
 I have here and it's about vampire academy 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:07.340
 fifth spirit debt delivery of the 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:09.020
 saga vampire academy is a saga that does not 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.579
 needs presentation but what does 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.979
 I need is for people to stop 

00:01:10.579 --> 00:01:14.900
 compare it with other fucking stories 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:17.150
 because this is not 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.920
 a vampire novel is worth I do not know if 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.630
 it is clear they go for academies of what 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.850
 better little we have in literature 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:24.470
 youthful and people pass this saga and 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:26.540
 I do not understand it because it's wonderful and 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:28.640
 I'm pissed off reading it fuck I want that 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:29.810
 Forge took out and the sixth is worth when 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.430
 I was doing that list I had 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.620
 proposed not to put any translation 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:35.990
 mine but this year I had to translate a 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:38.690
 bunch of incredible novels if that 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:41.720
 it was impossible not to choose one is that no no 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:44.180
 I could not so I tried to limit it 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.710
 to two and the first one is a siege 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.390
 usually to the executioner law the 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:49.640
 second part of the trilogy of laughter 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:52.100
 started with shadow and bone to see in 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.380
 serious because I did not do this trilogy or 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:56.420
 be serious this trilogy is what 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.460
 better than you can find in the fifth 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.229
 days right now in the usa it is 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.180
 pressing very hard and in Spain the 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:03.380
 people pass and I do not understand it because it is 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:06.950
 wonderful 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:09.110
 this book is brutal is worth in ritual the 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.940
 technology itself is wonderful and for 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:13.370
 What you do not read is that I do not understand 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:15.860
 I do not understand it because it's wonderful and 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.810
 he is already and he continued with his whiskey without 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.400
 'daredevil' bristles that I can say of 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.200
 dave and warn him that he has not said is already 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.150
 one of the favorite sectors 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.590
 is probably in the top suite of 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.390
 my favorite authors because it's 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.280
 wonderful their noises are wonderful 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.500
 create the cool characters treats the 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:33.769
 lg in an incredibly good way and 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:35.120
 Finally my books are wonderful 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:37.099
 Levite does not always end up full of 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.140
 doubled tapes and it is that you have so many 

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:42.530
 wonderful phrases and so many dialogues 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:45.769
 perfect and so many reflections and I do not know 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:48.680
 I love I love that whiskey sing and 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:50.690
 read it and I continue with another translation 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.910
 the monothema is very real and it's about 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:54.860
 origin of jennifer the fourth armantrout 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:56.900
 delivery of the saga looks started with 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:59.120
 exile and ends with the opposition that 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:01.220
 will go on sale on January 20 if not 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.230
 I'm wrong these great birds go 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:05.299
 improving more or less with each book 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:07.010
 well the third one could be said that 

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:09.349
 stagnates a bit because it's more 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:11.239
 transient but the fourth is brutal and 

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:13.430
 the fifth and years I say in fact not what 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:15.349
 I include because I do not know why I do not 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:17.569
 I include because I can not put 11 because 

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:18.950
 I can only put 10 but seriously it is 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:20.870
 cool 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:23.209
 this book is counted from the point 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:25.280
 of damon and kate and not only of 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:26.540
 Katy and it's very interesting because it 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:28.489
 You can also see the psychology of 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:30.860
 character of damon his way of thinking and 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:32.780
 It's all very interesting and good if 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:34.069
 click here the addict will have the 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:36.050
 video in which I talk about the translation 

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:37.790
 now we continue with a double ration of 

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:39.769
 cassandra clare on one side clockwork 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:41.420
 princess third part of hell 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:43.790
 device xinzo as it is called in Spain 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:46.730
 shadow hunters 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:48.290
 and good in this trilogy is wonderful 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:50.780
 This wonderful book for you 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:52.790
 They make you cry and laugh and hate Cassandra 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:55.099
 Clare and love her and be happy at the same 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:56.989
 time because it's perfection I had read 

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:58.670
 the first book when it came out but then 

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:00.200
 late the second and I did not remember 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:02.030
 nothing so during this year I have reread 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:04.880
 the first and continuing with the trilogy 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:07.819
 and this is what is wonderful 

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:09.230
 perfect and I continue with sitev headley fire 

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:11.690
 of which I have spoken on the channel 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:13.579
 previously it's a lovely cover it's 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:15.110
 one cachaco is wonderful and has me 

00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:17.810
 delighted is my favorite book of the 

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:19.850
 saga a brutal or is not so emotional 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:20.900
 as I think you think but also you 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:24.290
 makes cry 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:25.970
 to Sandra because when it seems that everything 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:27.889
 he's going to fix himself he fucks himself even more 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:30.440
 when a solution appears it turns out that 

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:31.910
 it's even worse than they had open 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:33.800
 or river the horrible horrible but it's 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:35.630
 wonderful so I love I'm 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:37.820
 wishing you should chronicles what 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:41.030
 I have here I taught you and the 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:42.620
 saga 9 and 6 or evacuate Czech dan and 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:45.080
 everything about this woman because the 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:47.750
 I love the master we washed it lasted a lot and the 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:49.520
 I want a lot for my life so fuck 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:51.259
 I'm going to show you another translation of mine 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:53.030
 grasshopper jungle andrew submissive 

00:04:51.259 --> 00:04:55.910
 see then I'm going to ask a question because 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:57.800
 you always complain to see is not an attack 

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:59.479
 ok but people in general in the 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:01.520
 blogosphere on youtube in all the 

00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:03.800
 parties complains that the literature 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:06.050
 juvenile is chronic that all books 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:08.180
 they are the same as always everything is more than 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:09.800
 the same thing or yes I do understand 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:11.570
 because there are many books that are the same 

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:13.250
 but my question is because when 

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:15.620
 appears a different one you pass him 

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:19.070
 because you pass this jewel, this is 

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:20.870
 book is a real gem is the most 

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:22.430
 I miss that I read in my life I already told you 

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:24.139
 a little more about him in a video that already 

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:26.630
 I did about the translation but it's 

00:05:24.139 --> 00:05:27.380
 wonderful or be the author mix 

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:29.510
 genders 

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:31.220
 way so brutal and so strange that I could 

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:33.140
 to have left or a fucking shit or a 

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:34.850
 jewel and a gem has come out because 

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:36.950
 the book goes on the one hand three guys 

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:38.600
 how good one has his girlfriend is very 

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:40.490
 in love with her and also has her 

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:41.840
 gay best friend is in love with him and 

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:43.820
 the protagonist is also in love 

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:45.800
 of his friend and that is to say he is in love with 

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:47.600
 his girlfriend and his gay friend does not know what 

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:49.310
 is going on in your head you do not know by 

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:51.170
 what are you interested in things that you should not 

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:53.060
 feel because he is attracted to his 

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:55.460
 best friend when your girlfriend wants is 

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:57.130
 all very strange is very confusing and the 

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:59.540
 relationship between the three characters is 

00:05:57.130 --> 00:06:01.580
 wonderful or is it the best 

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:02.750
 relationships between characters and ni 

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:05.000
 I'm even talking about relationships 

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:06.740
 loving that he has gone in my life and 

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.230
 then part you put in the mixture some 

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:11.990
 mantis of meter eighty in height that 

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:14.570
 they eat people and that does not mix 

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:16.160
 it's like an explosive mixture makes boom and 

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:17.930
 it's very strange but the book is 

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:19.910
 wonderful please do them a favor 

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:21.980
 and read it because it's a real gem 

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:24.050
 I continue with another book of deg and they say 

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:26.150
 this time in the company of john green and 

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:27.860
 about will grace are wilkinson in short 

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:30.560
 this book is wonderful and has the 

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:32.390
 pure essence of both authors because 

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:34.080
 each one writes a character and is 

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:36.360
 great my favorite is him 

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:38.370
 but I have a weakness for him 

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:40.139
 they say and their characters but it's a book 

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:42.090
 great they are going to publish it soon in 

00:06:40.139 --> 00:06:43.979
 Spain although good they are going to put a 

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:45.960
 very shabby phrase on the cover that by 

00:06:43.979 --> 00:06:47.699
 true do not pay attention to those phrases 

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:49.319
 they have nothing to do with the voucher 

00:06:47.699 --> 00:06:50.699
 they just ring the bell I feel the 

00:06:49.319 --> 00:06:52.500
 angle change the phrase here and in the 

00:06:50.699 --> 00:06:53.879
 cover is lie but free 

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:55.349
 wonderful and that you read it 

00:06:53.879 --> 00:06:56.400
 that they sell it to us like a novel of 

00:06:55.349 --> 00:06:58.680
 john green what are they going to do 

00:06:56.400 --> 00:07:00.150
 because it's not purely john green and 

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:02.009
