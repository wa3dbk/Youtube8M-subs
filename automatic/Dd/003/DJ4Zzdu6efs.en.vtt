challenging part of my job here at ABF

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:06.940 
challenging part of my job here at ABF
is<00:01:05.000> as<00:01:05.600> it<00:01:05.840> is<00:01:05.930> with<00:01:06.140> any<00:01:06.290> truck<00:01:06.590> driver<00:01:06.830> it

sometimes just being gone away from the
family<00:01:09.040> but<00:01:10.040> the<00:01:10.160> positive<00:01:10.640> side<00:01:10.850> of<00:01:10.970> this

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.090 
family but the positive side of this

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:14.350 
family but the positive side of this
with<00:01:11.240> a<00:01:11.360> BF<00:01:11.720> is<00:01:11.990> the<00:01:12.260> fact<00:01:12.500> that<00:01:12.820> 90<00:01:13.820> to<00:01:13.970> 95

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:14.360 
with a BF is the fact that 90 to 95

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.450 
with a BF is the fact that 90 to 95
percent<00:01:14.390> of<00:01:14.810> our<00:01:14.960> runs<00:01:15.200> you<00:01:15.500> go<00:01:15.650> out<00:01:15.830> you<00:01:16.280> lay

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:16.460 
percent of our runs you go out you lay

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:18.280 
percent of our runs you go out you lay
down<00:01:16.490> and<00:01:16.970> you're<00:01:17.570> right<00:01:17.690> back<00:01:17.840> home<00:01:18.050> the<00:01:18.170> next

down and you're right back home the next
day<00:01:18.440> what<00:01:19.340> I<00:01:19.370> enjoy<00:01:19.730> most<00:01:19.760> about<00:01:20.240> a<00:01:20.420> BF<00:01:20.900> is

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:23.020 
day what I enjoy most about a BF is
really<00:01:21.770> just<00:01:22.040> the<00:01:22.160> freedom<00:01:22.400> that<00:01:22.670> it<00:01:22.790> comes

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.030 
really just the freedom that it comes

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:25.480 
really just the freedom that it comes
