00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:06.399
 where together because I stop that 

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:09.519
 Introduce quadrocopter 9982 because we 

00:00:06.399 --> 00:00:13.120
 Boats are enthusiastic about it for little 

00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:15.009
 money so much fun to get around it 

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:18.150
 probably wondering what I call it now time 

00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:20.740
 Airbags landing by this 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.640
 Cable ties are much softer 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:26.119
 is not that scary 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:29.119
 Motors are not a change 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:31.419
 just sang together 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:34.129
 the thing is actually really easy and 

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:38.510
 We left North Korea in the camera 

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:39.460
 So do not need equal only the 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:41.440
 remote control before 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:44.050
 and then it can start 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:47.980
 be surprised 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:52.809
 That's the remote control customer bring 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:56.629
 you have the lever to the front is gas 

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:58.609
 Full throttle or less gas on the side 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:01.640
 about that now is that the drone 

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:04.610
 This is now on the moto2 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:07.929
 Setting this lever is flying it 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:10.820
 forward to back here still backwards 

00:01:07.929 --> 00:01:12.950
 left right that they are practically right 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:14.300
 or left off draw whole 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:16.520
 switch to mode 4 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:18.410
 then suddenly times are reversed 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:21.649
 for left-handed, for example, then advantageous for 

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:25.340
 we better start and transMode 

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:26.420
 mode beginner she does not give so much 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.180
 spirit from home 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.979
 You can do the loopings by a pressure 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:33.079
 on the camera 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:35.060
 it is actually total is just very 

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:37.600
 wanted to fly fast this bit 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:41.570
 have learned one said advanced mode 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:43.369
 now it only needs grass against and 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:45.619
 if you jerk the lever all the way up 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:47.119
 own position gives you too 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:49.310
 Immediately about beats 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:51.740
 she also needs long in camera 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:55.969
 mode so in the camera tone each other 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:57.009
 it's turn on the camera takes it 

00:01:55.969 --> 00:02:00.530
 worked out 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:02.329
 here also have the debris button if 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.909
 you have to come winter that 

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:08.710
 Correct everything best 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:08.710
 to zero and nothing going on 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:17.110
 Now be surprised what that 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.110
 little things can do anything 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.640
 it just makes animal fun 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.640
 with this thing 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.819
 unfortunately we have a bit much today 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:38.040
 wind now we do not want to be so tall 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:42.120
 it is only including battery 100 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:45.750
 gram and then of course they can in it 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:47.489
 already pack and tow away wisely 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.209
 He is far away from you 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:51.000
 no more 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:54.470
 whether it is flying right or left 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:57.209
 forward or backward design of over 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.200
 20 yards away or say 50 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:00.420
 meters around the circle 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:03.239
 At that time , it was wonderfully under control 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:07.500
 you see exactly what she does what you do 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:09.860
 actually makes the regulators neuses completely 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.860
 easy 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000
 now also the cliq in the background that 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:27.000
 you can do it normally when the kids 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.370
 Mode flying off had a stable position 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.150
 Up in the air , she can easily 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:36.239
 on advents click on the pros 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:37.130
 Mode and can so their art pieces 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:39.540
 do 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:40.110
 by the art pieces is of course like that 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:42.090
 light 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:43.170
 So, very quickly, let's say empty 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:45.810
 another ten minutes 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:49.590
 if he flies from the beginning mode and 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:51.570
 really only then that flies and also 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:53.850
 our experience goes to the parco one 

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:56.160
 Battery almost to the 20 minutes were 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:57.989
 All three rechargeable batteries have three charging cables 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:00.570
 bought that we fly one 

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:07.350
 hour with the thing and it makes it easy 

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:12.470
 only fun and very surprised 

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:12.470
 too small batteries so much fun 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:29.670
 I hope we could have you here 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:34.080
 best ideas what we think about it 

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:36.510
 animals fun so that so little money like that 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:40.430
 have a lot of fun to come too much 

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:45.130
 it is only recommended 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:45.130
 something is so much fun with it
