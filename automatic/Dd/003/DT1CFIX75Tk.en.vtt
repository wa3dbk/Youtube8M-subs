00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:45.020 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:53.200 

oh<00:04:45.110> that<00:04:45.710> was<00:04:45.800> the<00:04:45.889> wrong<00:04:46.039> one<00:04:46.280> dang<00:04:47.120> it

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:53.210 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:55.499 

I<00:04:53.270> don't<00:04:53.900> know<00:04:53.960> if<00:04:54.020> this<00:04:54.080> is<00:04:54.139> a<00:04:54.229> great<00:04:54.440> idea<00:04:54.560> but

00:04:55.499 --> 00:04:55.509 
I don't know if this is a great idea but

00:04:55.509 --> 00:05:02.730 
I don't know if this is a great idea but
it's<00:04:56.509> all<00:04:56.660> I've<00:04:56.780> got

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:02.740 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:04.529 

yeah<00:05:03.340> this<00:05:03.490> is<00:05:03.639> all<00:05:03.880> i<00:05:03.910> can<00:05:03.970> think<00:05:04.090> of<00:05:04.300> to<00:05:04.419> do

00:05:04.529 --> 00:05:04.539 
yeah this is all i can think of to do

00:05:04.539 --> 00:05:06.719 
yeah this is all i can think of to do
because<00:05:04.780> it's<00:05:05.099> but<00:05:06.099> it<00:05:06.190> is<00:05:06.310> hitting<00:05:06.580> there

00:05:06.719 --> 00:05:06.729 
because it's but it is hitting there

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:09.420 
because it's but it is hitting there
that's<00:05:07.060> good<00:05:07.300> so<00:05:07.599> maybe<00:05:07.840> I<00:05:07.949> maybe<00:05:08.949> I<00:05:09.099> figured

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:09.430 
that's good so maybe I maybe I figured

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:18.010 
that's good so maybe I maybe I figured
this<00:05:09.550> flight<00:05:09.759> out<00:05:12.690> jump<00:05:13.690> at<00:05:13.780> me<00:05:13.810> and<00:05:14.080> boom

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:18.020 

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:20.680 

oh<00:05:18.080> yeah<00:05:18.740> this<00:05:18.860> is<00:05:18.919> much<00:05:19.160> easier<00:05:19.360> spider<00:05:20.360> form

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:20.690 
oh yeah this is much easier spider form

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:22.270 
oh yeah this is much easier spider form
comes<00:05:20.960> it<00:05:21.139> into<00:05:21.530> its<00:05:21.680> own<00:05:21.800> at<00:05:21.949> the<00:05:22.009> very<00:05:22.220> very

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:22.280 
comes it into its own at the very very

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:24.070 
comes it into its own at the very very
end<00:05:22.729> of<00:05:23.090> the<00:05:23.210> game<00:05:23.389> how<00:05:23.629> do<00:05:23.690> you<00:05:23.750> like<00:05:23.840> that
