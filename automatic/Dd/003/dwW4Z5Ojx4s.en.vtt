00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640 
wins this game and i think they go to

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.110 
wins this game and i think they go to
the<00:02:40.909> bcs<00:02:41.329> title<00:02:41.359> game<00:02:41.720> but<00:02:42.440> two<00:02:43.340> touchdowns<00:02:43.909> is

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
the bcs title game but two touchdowns is

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.479 
the bcs title game but two touchdowns is
a<00:02:44.180> lot<00:02:44.659> of<00:02:44.870> points<00:02:45.200> in<00:02:45.290> this<00:02:45.440> Texas<00:02:45.920> team<00:02:46.099> that

00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:46.489 
a lot of points in this Texas team that

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:48.369 
a lot of points in this Texas team that
they<00:02:47.060> play<00:02:47.359> well<00:02:47.629> they<00:02:47.840> score<00:02:48.170> a<00:02:48.200> lot<00:02:48.349> of

00:02:48.369 --> 00:02:48.379 
they play well they score a lot of

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:51.369 
they play well they score a lot of
points<00:02:48.680> but<00:02:48.829> they<00:02:48.920> start<00:02:49.510> notoriously<00:02:50.510> slow<00:02:50.900> I

00:02:51.369 --> 00:02:51.379 
points but they start notoriously slow I

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:53.410 
points but they start notoriously slow I
think<00:02:52.159> the<00:02:52.280> slow<00:02:52.549> starts<00:02:52.940> going<00:02:53.120> to<00:02:53.209> cost

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
think the slow starts going to cost

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:55.449 
think the slow starts going to cost
those<00:02:53.720> people<00:02:54.109> that<00:02:54.139> bet<00:02:54.590> on<00:02:54.829> the<00:02:54.950> Longhorns

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:55.459 
those people that bet on the Longhorns

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:56.619 
those people that bet on the Longhorns
in<00:02:55.549> this<00:02:55.700> game<00:02:55.909> we're<00:02:56.269> going<00:02:56.359> to<00:02:56.420> take

00:02:56.619 --> 00:02:56.629 
in this game we're going to take

00:02:56.629 --> 00:02:58.330 
in this game we're going to take
Nebraska<00:02:57.349> and<00:02:57.440> the<00:02:57.530> points<00:02:57.889> we're<00:02:58.190> going<00:02:58.280> to

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:00.709 
play this one kind of small and I think

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:02.379 
play this one kind of small and I think
this<00:03:00.859> one<00:03:01.040> has<00:03:01.069> a<00:03:01.489> chance<00:03:01.790> of<00:03:01.909> being<00:03:02.060> actually

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:02.389 
this one has a chance of being actually

00:03:02.389 --> 00:03:05.199 
this one has a chance of being actually
a<00:03:02.510> really<00:03:03.109> really<00:03:03.500> good<00:03:03.769> game<00:03:04.010> so<00:03:04.549> in<00:03:05.030> any

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:05.209 
a really really good game so in any

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:07.509 
a really really good game so in any
event<00:03:05.680> we're<00:03:06.680> going<00:03:06.799> to<00:03:06.859> take<00:03:06.980> Nebraska<00:03:07.489> the
