the<00:00:43.460> monitors<00:00:44.240> as<00:00:44.390> you<00:00:44.570> can<00:00:44.690> see<00:00:44.810> a<00:00:44.840> higher<00:00:45.470> up

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:45.770 
the monitors as you can see a higher up

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:47.950

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:47.960 
which means that I'm looking at them at

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.640 
which means that I'm looking at them at
a<00:00:48.020> better<00:00:48.200> level<00:00:48.580> for<00:00:49.580> my<00:00:49.700> back<00:00:49.940> it's<00:00:50.500> in<00:00:51.500> the

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:53.390 
exchange so much easier plus obviously

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:54.910 
exchange so much easier plus obviously
there's<00:00:53.570> a<00:00:53.660> storage<00:00:54.110> factor<00:00:54.530> in<00:00:54.650> terms

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:54.920 
there's a storage factor in terms

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.620 
there's a storage factor in terms
