collected a gallon you know in in about

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.930 
collected a gallon you know in in about
a<00:00:54.480> half<00:00:54.780> of<00:00:54.960> my<00:00:55.079> shower<00:00:55.460> it<00:00:56.460> gave<00:00:56.640> me<00:00:56.760> the<00:00:56.789> idea

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
a half of my shower it gave me the idea

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.240 
a half of my shower it gave me the idea
what<00:00:57.480> if<00:00:57.570> I<00:00:57.719> put<00:00:58.050> this<00:00:58.199> to<00:00:58.440> your<00:00:58.530> bucket<00:00:58.949> down

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
what if I put this to your bucket down

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.660 
what if I put this to your bucket down
and<00:00:59.640> then<00:01:00.149> I<00:01:00.180> take<00:01:00.449> a<00:01:00.510> regular<00:01:00.809> shower<00:01:01.670> how

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
and then I take a regular shower how

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.590 
and then I take a regular shower how
much<00:01:02.850> water<00:01:03.059> is<00:01:04.019> that<00:01:04.350> going<00:01:04.530> to<00:01:04.619> save<00:01:04.830> me<00:01:05.600> this

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
much water is that going to save me this

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.100 
much water is that going to save me this
is<00:01:06.780> really<00:01:06.960> important<00:01:07.590> because<00:01:07.680> I<00:01:08.490> live<00:01:08.880> in<00:01:09.420> a

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
is really important because I live in a

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.240 
is really important because I live in a

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
bit of water that I can reuse is going

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.609 
bit of water that I can reuse is going
to<00:01:20.970> be<00:01:21.119> a<00:01:21.150> benefit<00:01:21.689> even<00:01:21.960> if<00:01:22.200> i<00:01:22.290> can<00:01:22.500> only

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
to be a benefit even if i can only

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.460 
to be a benefit even if i can only
gather<00:01:23.220> up<00:01:23.549> ten<00:01:24.270> percent<00:01:24.689> of<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:24.960> water<00:01:25.350> that

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470

shower<00:01:55.470> and<00:01:55.860> then<00:01:55.950> you<00:01:56.159> can<00:01:56.340> see<00:01:56.549> or<00:01:56.820> maybe<00:01:57.090> you

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
shower and then you can see or maybe you

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.209 
shower and then you can see or maybe you
can't<00:01:57.479> see<00:01:57.600> but<00:01:57.780> that's<00:01:58.140> about<00:01:58.380> two-thirds<00:01:59.219> of

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
can't see but that's about two-thirds of

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:02.120 
can't see but that's about two-thirds of
a<00:01:59.490> gallon<00:01:59.880> i<00:02:00.000> think<00:02:00.270> i<00:02:00.740> think<00:02:01.740> i<00:02:01.890> might<00:02:02.009> have

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
a gallon i think i think i might have

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.090 
a gallon i think i think i might have
got<00:02:02.250> a<00:02:02.280> little<00:02:02.340> bit<00:02:02.640> more<00:02:02.820> about<00:02:03.860> right<00:02:04.860> when<00:02:05.040> i

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
got a little bit more about right when i

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.620 
got a little bit more about right when i
was<00:02:05.219> about<00:02:05.310> done<00:02:05.579> with<00:02:05.640> my<00:02:05.909> shower<00:02:06.119> i<00:02:06.299> moved

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
was about done with my shower i moved

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.809 
was about done with my shower i moved
the<00:02:06.780> bucket<00:02:07.110> a<00:02:07.200> few<00:02:07.409> inches<00:02:07.560> and<00:02:08.039> i<00:02:08.280> think<00:02:08.759> i

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
the bucket a few inches and i think i

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.580 
the bucket a few inches and i think i
was<00:02:08.940> catching<00:02:09.090> quite<00:02:09.450> a<00:02:09.479> bit<00:02:09.660> more

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
was catching quite a bit more

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.500 
was catching quite a bit more
but<00:02:11.590> you<00:02:12.370> know<00:02:12.459> you<00:02:12.609> can<00:02:12.760> figure<00:02:12.939> you<00:02:13.120> average

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
but you know you can figure you average

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.440 
but you know you can figure you average

just<00:02:16.569> leave<00:02:16.810> that<00:02:17.079> there<00:02:17.140> and<00:02:19.950> empty<00:02:20.950> it<00:02:21.189> when

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
just leave that there and empty it when

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:23.309 
just leave that there and empty it when
it<00:02:21.519> gets<00:02:21.549> the<00:02:21.790> bay<00:02:21.969> about<00:02:22.329> three<00:02:22.629> gallons<00:02:22.810> four
