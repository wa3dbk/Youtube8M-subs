00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:11.219
 hello to all and hello to all these 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.429
 case rage and anna gund hi all the 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:13.200
 world 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:16.920
 and here we are gathered together finally 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.380
 exist in this holy place seurin 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.390
 seniors with this animal 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:23.039
 exactly for pokemon x and y gl 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:27.150
 in the man in this case my gesture 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:29.580
 version y / y that you could test in length 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.080
 wide and especially crooked and you will 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.850
 can you tell him what you wear 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.739
 and guillon what we thought about it 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.030
 already starting with a great plan when 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.160
 same and I see what you think about it early 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.760
 but then you know we recognize that 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.100
 reminds me of something 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.950
 I quickly swear I swear 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.360
 not at all but actually 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:47.910
 actually in pokemon here Greek 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.829
 there are many references to France 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.940
 and here we are in the city says umih this 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.270
 that a bit the equivalent of the city of 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.559
 paris and precisely we find as I 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.390
 so I was saying a lot of references to 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.760
 level of customs at level 2 at 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.170
 level of French culture so game 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.550
 precisely the first gel 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.589
 it's going to be there we got a little 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.110
 destabilizing me yeah on the potato 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.490
 this is his and chauvinistic and suddenly I 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.290
 wanted I wanted to show a little bit all 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.640
 the novelties of this episode that are 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.229
 which are related to the infringements 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.850
 report with that and for once we're going 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.250
 take a taxi or first novelty 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.350
 in the series 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:21.210
 yes by bike he does the taxi probably has 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.000
 what to do to go back 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:27.840
 the bikes and we're going to go in a 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.610
 chic shop to wear here I am 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.729
 luxury tastes already had it all 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.890
 normal you know exactly the 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.079
 mind-blowing salary you see the list 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.729
 with regular play it's normal 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:41.159
 I buy clothes especially 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:44.430
 expensive to bring chic also exists in 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.390
 true and so we will go into the 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.040
 hungry shop because I wanted 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.750
 show one of the aspects that we see from the 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.700
 start in when we start the game 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.610
 is that the character is really 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.979
 customizable but in the sense that as soon 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.270
 the departure already we can choose a little 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:58.799
 this swarm of fans have the cut of 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.630
 hair is offered to measure in the game 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:02.490
 after that we can buy outfits so there 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.270
 for example all there it costs very very 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.010
 dear for what I went in the 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.920
 shop of him 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:08.300
 really we see the latest and 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.950
 realize how poor you are 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.970
 here I was feeling bad actually if I 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:12.860
 I'm poor it's because I bought 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:14.840
 the brakes we see there so it's a 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:16.610
 little is a little for this reason and we 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.070
 can go in the east in the cabins 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:21.050
 tried trying the brakes like that so 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:22.790
 there are many more of 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:24.050
 customization it's a month point soon 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:25.760
 the departure I found nice because 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:28.370
 precisely my pokémon it 's still a 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.720
 rpg a wii sees that one says and so 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:31.580
 it's a good thing to have 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:34.130
 all these possibilities there when it's 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:35.660
 the style suitable for younger audiences 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:37.010
 pokemon officials are a bit of public 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.360
 there are the youngest there are these sails has 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.440
 open the series has - so much is they 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.060
 play again here it's simple 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:43.190
 like me exactly 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:46.450
 so that's it can be afraid especially 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:49.280
 to the youngest a little bit yes I want 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.390
 it's exactly exactly that 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.190
 so there you see we can we have 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:53.420
 fitting rooms so we can we can 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:55.160
 wear a little brakes that we want so 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.020
 there I'm going I 'll go back I 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:00.170
 will not change me because we're not going 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:01.490
 necessarily too stressed not gone 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:03.230
 on it's just to show that 

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:04.610
 we know it's possible now 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:06.560
 in pokemon and it's an add me that 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:07.880
 got me early and later not contribute 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:10.220
 alongside the chain victims 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:11.690
 ah yes completely and besides there are 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:13.730
 a lot of small shops in the same 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:15.140
 if the stake is there then we are at like I 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:16.850
 said halimi this young and almost 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:18.560
 talk about it my thoughts necessarily 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:20.150
 there is and a little air of resemblance 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.739
 e-shop a shop do not want 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:23.090
 as expensive it depends on the boudy no no 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:25.430
 no no there it's rain I think 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:26.720
 it's the most expensive game and so alas 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:27.920
 we can walk around a little bit 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.540
 in the streets so soak in 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:31.280
 the atmosphere we find in particular not bad 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:33.709
 so I'll put the bike away 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:35.030
 go a little fast otherwise we find all 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:36.890
 the moods and the cases it is by 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:39.200
 example we voted boyer return 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:41.200
 the same you can drink and or web can 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:43.660
 chat with people then he 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:46.569
 there are also beverage sales for 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:47.950
 the pokemon and it's so there is not bad 

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:49.030
 of things like I said that meaning in 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:50.920
 this city is a lot of activities 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:53.379
 business appendices that are really 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:54.510
 there are also interesting fact is 

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:58.060
 can say it's a great job 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:04:00.130
 completely crazy where she has not 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:01.510
 everything is but is really an aspect 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:03.640
 which I like well I like this kind 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:05.130
 details since apartment where that 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:07.390
 still remains a rpg despite everything 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:09.310
 it's still a good idea to have 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:10.860
 a customization aspect pushed that 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:14.230
 gives a little life to the office 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:15.489
 I see there exactly 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:16.870
 customize and from see see 

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:18.310
 things that other players do not 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:19.090
 not especially good here it is 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:21.609
 exactly what 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:23.229
 and here I show you something else with this 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:26.470
 wonderful name of the photographer at the top 

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:30.550
 blockade then at the me I managed to 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:32.260
 well the bottles like that there are 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:33.900
 not bad nothing has not hurt we can take 

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:36.550
 pictures at certain points 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:37.810
 particular cities so here we 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:39.460
 is pretty well placed since we are 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:40.870
 near the toa someone who said 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:42.490
 so yes it's not too bad to settle 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:43.780
 a welcome bah must settle a little bit 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:45.580
 yeah we just have the ba ba we can do 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:47.229
 that but after that we see that 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:49.419
 their masters to see that he is in 

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:50.979
 to do that in fact here you go 

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:51.520
 I'm trying to sort a little bit and 

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:53.410
 adjust my 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:54.430
 and as she trembles a little bit but 

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:55.870
 it is above all that it is capable in 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:57.070
 do you feel embarrassed we do not know very well 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:58.930
 practice there so this program in 

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:01.419
 looking we have to take the game side 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:02.620
 can adjust after to make it 

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:04.300
 the finer image by the way that makes me 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:05.800
 to laugh because behind and a guy 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:07.600
 disguised as a pokemon who spoils a little 

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:08.950
 the picture but a little bit and obtuse 

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:11.680
 takes the picture is very good are 

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:13.090
 treated gorgeous missed a career 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:15.940
 pictures here we feel that he is 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:17.440
 completely failed so here we go not the 

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:20.710
 save but there are several points 

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:23.440
 which are quite interesting so by 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:24.789
 example at the seaside etc. we really 

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:26.139
 you have great eyesight he can take 

00:05:24.789 --> 00:05:27.490
 photos so it's not your device 

00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:29.500
 great used by a great mobility 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:30.639
 but it's fun here it's typically 

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:33.099
 the kind of side activities that can 

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:35.919
 to please who can please 

00:05:33.099 --> 00:05:37.900
 we are in the trip a little beauty and his 

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:40.150
 us and vendome sales 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:41.480
 ventos and vendome or car that no 

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:43.420
 for twenty years 

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:47.540
 a sharp apple brawl up but no 

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:49.400
 it's yes I did not understand the yes no 

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:51.920
 it's not on but hey yes there is 

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:53.450
 maybe oxidized references there 

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:55.970
 had the taxis too there are quite a few 

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:57.920
 darren of places for example means 

00:05:55.970 --> 00:06:00.920
 no nonsense I think here because 

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:02.150
 it's the station no it's not the station but 

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:04.160
 gold is a place where you can do 

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:05.480
 fighting so there is a train station there is a 

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:07.790
 place where we can do fighting there 

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:08.990
 ya it's true the city is very complete 

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:11.030
 then you will get there twice in the 

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:12.650
 play so the first thing to go there 

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:14.300
 you can not all explored the second 

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:17.510
 times when you go back there are a lot 

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:19.820
 more things to do and here it starts 

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:21.110
 to become quite interesting so 

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:23.300
 the device I can show also a little 

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:27.440
 the small streets so there we have places 

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:28.520
 with rollers way we after that is where 

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:30.080
 it's the biggest of the game the others 

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:31.220
 cities are a little less yes yes the 

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:32.870
 old the other cities are more 

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:34.970
 small but this one she is really 

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:36.230
 successful however as you can 

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:37.820
 see times there are small worries 

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:39.800
 camera I know it pissed me off 

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:41.060
 by putting their trust in the plans 

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:42.260
 this is the one we spend a little too close 

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:44.000
 from one place we go back wanting 

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:45.770
 because they were a little good case 

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.630
 with the cameras that flicker a little 

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:48.770
 it's not that we've had you ten 

00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:50.810
 minutes it took to do the 

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:52.340
 little plan of departures for them on the 

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:53.510
 Eiffel Tower we had a little galé these ten 

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:56.270
 minutes to succeed to see tonight 

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:57.680
 that's it exactly and finally that the 

00:06:56.270 --> 00:07:00.200
 nobody has a second the strict 

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:02.420
 no no it's inevitably it's a whole 

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:03.830
 little bit less practical paris laon 

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:07.580
 nature i'm going to show that too we have the 

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:09.830
 professor's lab plane trees which is a 

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:10.970
 who did not take plane trees 

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:11.659
 maybe one is not at all for that 

00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:14.000
 which is called like that 

00:07:11.659 --> 00:07:15.470
 no report but it's a teacher 

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.490
 in fact we meet from the beginning of 

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:18.439
 the adventure that gives us the first 

00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:21.620
 pokemon so the famous professor at 

00:07:18.439 --> 00:07:23.930
 every episode wii and that's it there has been 

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:25.370
 chain a bewildered gabor but there have been 

00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:25.699
 a packet anyway will not all 

00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:28.219
 to quote 

00:07:25.699 --> 00:07:30.439
 no and we can we can also go in 

00:07:28.219 --> 00:07:32.090
 his lab from time to time where we see there 

00:07:30.439 --> 00:07:32.449
 he will give us new objects 

00:07:32.090 --> 00:07:33.740
 etc. 

00:07:32.449 --> 00:07:36.979
 so we found offered the kind of the 

00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:39.289
 air hockey branch is certainly important 

00:07:36.979 --> 00:07:40.520
 it will be all for this first gl the goal 

00:07:39.289 --> 00:07:43.099
 was mostly to see a little bit 

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:45.229
 the Parisian atmosphere we will say yeah 

00:07:43.099 --> 00:07:47.060
 and there we may go a little more 

00:07:45.229 --> 00:07:48.349
 in the heart of the subject since on the 2nd g 

00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:49.960
 We will dwell on everything 

00:07:48.349 --> 00:07:52.759
 about fighting and new things 

00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:54.080
 you are a drawing with impatience of 

00:07:52.759 --> 00:07:56.060
 to know eh yes my all that we can 

00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:57.409
 to do in the fighting he will die and 

00:07:56.060 --> 00:08:00.110
 save was like my brain 

00:07:57.409 --> 00:08:01.430
