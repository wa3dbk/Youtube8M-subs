to<00:01:08.340> 55<00:01:08.820> is<00:01:09.830> 650<00:01:10.830> so<00:01:11.130> you're<00:01:11.310> looking<00:01:11.490> about<00:01:12.290> 175

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
to 55 is 650 so you're looking about 175

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.560 
to 55 is 650 so you're looking about 175
dollar<00:01:13.530> difference<00:01:13.979> I<00:01:14.400> say

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
dollar difference I say

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.060 
dollar difference I say
you<00:01:16.530> should<00:01:16.740> really<00:01:17.930> go<00:01:18.930> for<00:01:19.259> it<00:01:19.350> and<00:01:19.530> upgrade

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
you should really go for it and upgrade

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.320 
you should really go for it and upgrade
to<00:01:20.100> this<00:01:20.430> because<00:01:20.909> now<00:01:21.479> you<00:01:21.540> have<00:01:21.810> a<00:01:23.330> bigger

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
to this because now you have a bigger

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:29.390 
to this because now you have a bigger
zoom<00:01:24.720> then<00:01:25.650> you<00:01:25.860> do<00:01:26.040> with<00:01:26.280> the<00:01:26.520> 155<00:01:28.159> both<00:01:29.159> of

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
zoom then you do with the 155 both of

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.969 
zoom then you do with the 155 both of
them<00:01:29.810> do<00:01:30.810> go<00:01:31.200> from<00:01:32.780> f-stop<00:01:33.780> three<00:01:34.500> point<00:01:34.770> five

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
them do go from f-stop three point five

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.990 
them do go from f-stop three point five
to<00:01:35.340> five<00:01:36.090> point<00:01:36.390> six<00:01:36.770> so<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:38.040> only<00:01:38.729> difference

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
to five point six so the only difference

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.050 
to five point six so the only difference
is<00:01:39.390> the<00:01:39.570> zoom<00:01:39.810> on<00:01:40.049> here<00:01:40.409> and<00:01:40.670> you<00:01:41.670> could<00:01:41.820> tell

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
is the zoom on here and you could tell

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:47.179 
is the zoom on here and you could tell
also<00:01:42.720> by<00:01:42.990> the<00:01:43.189> quality<00:01:44.189> of<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:44.399> build<00:01:46.009> this<00:01:47.009> is

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
also by the quality of the build this is

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.530 
also by the quality of the build this is
much<00:01:47.610> more<00:01:47.939> sturdy<00:01:48.240> and<00:01:50.090> then<00:01:51.090> you<00:01:51.180> have<00:01:51.360> your

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.440 
much more sturdy and then you have your
metal<00:01:52.320> ring<00:01:52.670> attachment<00:01:53.670> compared<00:01:54.060> to<00:01:54.210> the

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:09.430 

both<00:02:03.079> of<00:02:03.289> them<00:02:03.439> do<00:02:04.159> have<00:02:04.189> is<00:02:07.690> but<00:02:08.690> this<00:02:09.140> one

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 
both of them do have is but this one

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
comes with a new motor is TM a step-up

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.890 
comes with a new motor is TM a step-up
motor<00:02:15.099> it's<00:02:16.099> much<00:02:16.340> more<00:02:16.519> quieter<00:02:17.030> when<00:02:17.330> you're
