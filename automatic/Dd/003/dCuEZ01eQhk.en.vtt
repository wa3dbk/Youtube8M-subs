crisis<00:01:23.400> to<00:01:23.580> you<00:01:24.119> know<00:01:24.210> one<00:01:24.330> of<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:24.479> big<00:01:24.570> things

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
crisis to you know one of the big things

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.990 
crisis to you know one of the big things
for<00:01:24.900> us<00:01:24.990> was<00:01:25.170> really<00:01:25.409> challenging<00:01:25.650> the<00:01:26.610> the

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
for us was really challenging the the

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.420 
for us was really challenging the the
Nanosuit<00:01:27.750> way<00:01:28.020> making<00:01:28.590> the<00:01:28.650> aliens<00:01:29.009> as<00:01:29.130> mobile

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
Nanosuit way making the aliens as mobile

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:30.950 
Nanosuit way making the aliens as mobile
as<00:01:29.520> you<00:01:29.729> are<00:01:29.880> and<00:01:30.060> using<00:01:30.360> the<00:01:30.479> space<00:01:30.659> in<00:01:30.869> the

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
as you are and using the space in the

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.210 
as you are and using the space in the
same<00:01:31.140> way<00:01:31.259> that<00:01:31.409> you<00:01:31.560> do<00:01:31.740> so<00:01:31.920> you<00:01:31.950> can

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
same way that you do so you can

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.460 
same way that you do so you can
anticipate<00:01:32.520> and<00:01:32.880> also<00:01:33.810> learn<00:01:34.110> routes

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
anticipate and also learn routes

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.740 
anticipate and also learn routes
throughout<00:01:34.799> the<00:01:34.950> space<00:01:35.159> and<00:01:35.430> so<00:01:36.299> we<00:01:36.570> had<00:01:36.659> to

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
throughout the space and so we had to

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.719 
throughout the space and so we had to
make<00:01:36.900> aliens<00:01:37.829> that<00:01:38.070> we're<00:01:38.460> intelligent

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
make aliens that we're intelligent

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:39.890 
make aliens that we're intelligent
enough<00:01:39.060> to<00:01:39.119> find<00:01:39.390> our<00:01:39.509> way<00:01:39.600> through<00:01:39.630> the

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
enough to find our way through the

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.260 
enough to find our way through the
environment<00:01:40.409> and<00:01:40.530> as<00:01:41.340> part<00:01:41.759> of<00:01:41.850> that<00:01:41.909> you<00:01:42.240> know

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
environment and as part of that you know

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.789 
environment and as part of that you know
they<00:01:42.450> needed<00:01:42.689> to<00:01:42.720> be<00:01:42.780> bipedal<00:01:43.049> as<00:01:43.439> well<00:01:43.649> they

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
they needed to be bipedal as well they

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.200 
they needed to be bipedal as well they
needed<00:01:44.070> to<00:01:44.100> touch<00:01:44.399> the<00:01:44.579> ground<00:01:44.729> and<00:01:45.090> be<00:01:45.149> able

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
needed to touch the ground and be able

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.789 
needed to touch the ground and be able
to<00:01:45.329> jump<00:01:45.540> off<00:01:45.659> of<00:01:45.689> walls<00:01:46.020> and<00:01:46.290> slide<00:01:46.560> down<00:01:46.710> the

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
to jump off of walls and slide down the

side of buildings and get into the

side of buildings and get into the
combat<00:01:48.390> space<00:01:48.630> so<00:01:49.369> they<00:01:50.369> challenge<00:01:50.729> you<00:01:50.820> at

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
combat space so they challenge you at

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.910 
combat space so they challenge you at
all<00:01:51.060> points<00:01:51.240> in<00:01:51.509> time<00:01:51.689> and<00:01:52.140> it<00:01:52.290> really<00:01:52.530> forces

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
all points in time and it really forces

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.039 
all points in time and it really forces
you<00:01:53.070> to<00:01:53.250> change<00:01:53.460> your<00:01:53.549> tactics<00:01:53.790> on<00:01:54.149> the<00:01:54.270> fly<00:01:54.479> we

you to change your tactics on the fly we

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.590 
you to change your tactics on the fly we
have<00:01:55.140> these<00:01:55.229> areas<00:01:55.829> at<00:01:55.979> the<00:01:56.070> beginning<00:01:56.369> of

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:56.600 
have these areas at the beginning of

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.359 
have these areas at the beginning of
play<00:01:57.600> spaces<00:01:57.899> where<00:01:58.590> you<00:01:58.770> can<00:01:58.890> kind<00:01:59.100> of<00:01:59.159> plan

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
play spaces where you can kind of plan

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.490 
play spaces where you can kind of plan
and<00:01:59.759> catch<00:02:00.210> your<00:02:00.390> breath<00:02:00.540> and<00:02:00.869> you<00:02:01.140> know<00:02:01.259> maybe

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
and catch your breath and you know maybe

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.499 
and catch your breath and you know maybe
go<00:02:01.680> invisible<00:02:01.920> and<00:02:02.369> see<00:02:02.909> every<00:02:03.180> opportunity

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
go invisible and see every opportunity

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.660 
go invisible and see every opportunity
that's<00:02:03.930> out<00:02:04.170> there<00:02:04.380> and<00:02:04.530> then<00:02:05.189> from<00:02:05.520> there

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
that's out there and then from there

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.789 
that's out there and then from there
when<00:02:05.850> you<00:02:05.909> jump<00:02:06.119> into<00:02:06.270> the<00:02:06.420> action<00:02:06.450> that<00:02:07.049> plan

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
when you jump into the action that plan

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.400 
when you jump into the action that plan
sort<00:02:08.399> of<00:02:08.459> goes<00:02:08.580> out<00:02:08.729> the<00:02:08.849> window<00:02:09.050> because<00:02:10.050> it's

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
sort of goes out the window because it's

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.100 
sort of goes out the window because it's
very<00:02:10.530> dynamic<00:02:11.099> but<00:02:11.640> you<00:02:12.060> react<00:02:12.480> you<00:02:12.780> know

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
very dynamic but you react you know

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:14.690 
very dynamic but you react you know
somehow<00:02:13.380> they<00:02:13.530> react<00:02:13.860> to<00:02:13.950> the<00:02:14.370> actions<00:02:14.640> that

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
somehow they react to the actions that

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.000 
somehow they react to the actions that
you've<00:02:14.880> taken<00:02:15.030> we<00:02:15.780> have<00:02:15.900> nanosuit<00:02:16.620> modules

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
you've taken we have nanosuit modules

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:18.860 
you've taken we have nanosuit modules
that<00:02:17.130> you<00:02:17.310> can<00:02:17.700> customize<00:02:18.180> in<00:02:18.330> real<00:02:18.480> time<00:02:18.660> much

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
that you can customize in real time much

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.750 
that you can customize in real time much
like<00:02:19.020> your<00:02:19.200> weapon<00:02:19.500> so<00:02:19.740> it<00:02:20.040> with<00:02:20.370> your<00:02:20.490> weapon

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
like your weapon so it with your weapon

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.400 
like your weapon so it with your weapon
you<00:02:20.850> can<00:02:21.000> put<00:02:21.210> different<00:02:21.330> scopes<00:02:21.870> different

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
you can put different scopes different

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.050 
you can put different scopes different
grenade<00:02:22.890> launcher<00:02:23.250> you<00:02:23.550> know<00:02:23.640> shotgun

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
grenade launcher you know shotgun

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.460 
grenade launcher you know shotgun
whatever<00:02:24.420> silencer<00:02:24.900> on<00:02:24.930> your<00:02:25.170> weapon<00:02:25.380> you

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
whatever silencer on your weapon you

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:26.870 
whatever silencer on your weapon you
change<00:02:25.680> these<00:02:25.830> out<00:02:25.950> we<00:02:26.400> want<00:02:26.580> to<00:02:26.670> take<00:02:26.790> the

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
change these out we want to take the

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.040 
change these out we want to take the
same<00:02:27.030> approach<00:02:27.300> with<00:02:27.330> the<00:02:27.570> Nano<00:02:27.750> so<00:02:27.840> you<00:02:27.960> can

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
same approach with the Nano so you can

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:29.510 
same approach with the Nano so you can
crysis<00:02:28.350> 2<00:02:28.530> so<00:02:28.680> you<00:02:28.770> have<00:02:28.860> different<00:02:28.980> modules

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
crysis 2 so you have different modules

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.400 
crysis 2 so you have different modules
that<00:02:29.610> you<00:02:29.760> can<00:02:29.940> equip<00:02:30.210> and<00:02:30.360> one<00:02:30.960> as<00:02:31.170> an<00:02:31.320> example

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
that you can equip and one as an example

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.360 
that you can equip and one as an example
might<00:02:31.920> be<00:02:31.980> like<00:02:32.670> air<00:02:32.880> combat<00:02:33.270> where<00:02:33.510> you<00:02:34.050> can

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
might be like air combat where you can

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.650 
might be like air combat where you can
have<00:02:35.370> a<00:02:35.400> vertical<00:02:35.670> height<00:02:36.150> advantage<00:02:36.300> and<00:02:36.570> a

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
have a vertical height advantage and a

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.030 
have a vertical height advantage and a
play<00:02:36.840> space<00:02:36.990> and<00:02:37.260> you<00:02:37.320> see<00:02:37.470> an<00:02:37.530> enemy<00:02:37.650> below

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
play space and you see an enemy below

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.250 
play space and you see an enemy below
you<00:02:38.100> and<00:02:38.250> you<00:02:38.460> jump<00:02:38.790> and<00:02:38.970> then<00:02:39.390> you<00:02:39.510> just<00:02:39.690> smash

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
you and you jump and then you just smash

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.110 
you and you jump and then you just smash
the<00:02:40.500> ground<00:02:40.740> and<00:02:40.920> smash<00:02:41.190> them<00:02:41.220> as<00:02:41.670> well<00:02:41.880> and

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
the ground and smash them as well and

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:43.370 
the ground and smash them as well and
you<00:02:42.270> know<00:02:42.360> just<00:02:42.510> land<00:02:42.720> right<00:02:42.870> on<00:02:42.900> top<00:02:43.140> of<00:02:43.170> them

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
you know just land right on top of them

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:44.690 
you know just land right on top of them
home<00:02:43.560> alone<00:02:43.590> to<00:02:43.950> the<00:02:44.040> ground<00:02:44.250> that's

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
home alone to the ground that's

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.280 
home alone to the ground that's
something<00:02:45.090> that's<00:02:45.180> not<00:02:45.360> available<00:02:45.510> to<00:02:46.080> you<00:02:46.170> by

something that's not available to you by

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.080 
something that's not available to you by
default<00:02:46.680> but<00:02:47.070> as<00:02:47.220> a<00:02:47.250> choice<00:02:47.520> you<00:02:47.820> might<00:02:47.970> be

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
default but as a choice you might be

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.720 
default but as a choice you might be
giving<00:02:48.209> up<00:02:48.450> a<00:02:48.600> perk<00:02:48.870> that<00:02:49.200> our<00:02:50.160> module<00:02:50.640> that

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
giving up a perk that our module that

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.160 
giving up a perk that our module that
gives<00:02:50.940> you<00:02:51.060> like<00:02:51.180> a<00:02:51.209> little<00:02:51.450> bit<00:02:51.660> more<00:02:51.870> air

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
gives you like a little bit more air

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.050 
gives you like a little bit more air
time<00:02:52.560> like<00:02:52.950> lets<00:02:53.310> you<00:02:53.400> glide<00:02:53.640> a<00:02:53.670> little<00:02:53.970> bit

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060

time like lets you glide a little bit
further<00:02:54.270> to<00:02:54.360> make<00:02:54.540> a<00:02:54.570> longer<00:02:54.900> jump<00:02:55.200> so<00:02:55.650> you

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
further to make a longer jump so you

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:56.930 
further to make a longer jump so you
have<00:02:55.800> to<00:02:55.860> make<00:02:56.010> a<00:02:56.040> decision<00:02:56.190> do<00:02:56.580> I<00:02:56.640> want<00:02:56.880> to

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
have to make a decision do I want to

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:58.490 
have to make a decision do I want to
smash<00:02:57.180> people<00:02:57.390> or<00:02:57.690> do<00:02:57.840> I<00:02:57.870> want<00:02:58.080> to<00:02:58.200> jump<00:02:58.380> a

smash people or do I want to jump a
little<00:02:58.590> bit<00:02:58.800> further<00:02:58.950> and<00:02:59.220> it's<00:02:59.430> the<00:02:59.550> same

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
little bit further and it's the same

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.940 
little bit further and it's the same
single-player<00:03:00.300> multiplayer<00:03:00.510> the<00:03:01.500> way<00:03:01.739> that

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
and everything so I'm gonna say quite a

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.170 
and everything so I'm gonna say quite a
deep<00:03:32.130> amount<00:03:32.400> of<00:03:32.459> gameplay<00:03:32.640> I<00:03:32.880> was<00:03:33.060> very

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
deep amount of gameplay I was very

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:34.550 
deep amount of gameplay I was very
interesting<00:03:33.540> the<00:03:33.630> way<00:03:33.660> you<00:03:33.780> talk<00:03:34.170> about<00:03:34.380> the

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
interesting the way you talk about the

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.170 
interesting the way you talk about the
the<00:03:34.799> 3d<00:03:35.070> in<00:03:35.160> the<00:03:35.250> game<00:03:35.400> to<00:03:35.549> avoid<00:03:35.730> eye<00:03:35.880> strain

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
the 3d in the game to avoid eye strain

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.479 
the 3d in the game to avoid eye strain
it<00:03:36.420> some<00:03:36.720> how<00:03:37.440> you<00:03:37.500> describe<00:03:37.860> its<00:03:37.980> inside<00:03:38.370> the

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:38.489 
it some how you describe its inside the

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:40.009 
it some how you describe its inside the
TV<00:03:38.640> like<00:03:38.880> a<00:03:38.940> window<00:03:39.299> rather<00:03:39.450> than<00:03:39.600> popping<00:03:39.900> out

00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:40.019 
TV like a window rather than popping out

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:42.410 
TV like a window rather than popping out
yeah<00:03:40.680> we<00:03:41.220> call<00:03:41.370> it<00:03:41.459> a<00:03:41.519> concave<00:03:41.850> 3d<00:03:42.209> experience

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 
yeah we call it a concave 3d experience

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.240 
yeah we call it a concave 3d experience
because<00:03:42.930> it<00:03:43.049> starts<00:03:43.350> at<00:03:43.470> your<00:03:43.590> TV<00:03:43.739> screen<00:03:44.100> and

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
because it starts at your TV screen and

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:45.740 
because it starts at your TV screen and
goes<00:03:44.340> into<00:03:44.580> the<00:03:44.700> world<00:03:44.880> and<00:03:45.030> is<00:03:45.150> a<00:03:45.180> deep<00:03:45.420> 3d

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
goes into the world and is a deep 3d

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:47.570 
goes into the world and is a deep 3d
experience<00:03:46.019> where<00:03:46.739> we<00:03:46.860> can<00:03:46.980> offer<00:03:47.130> a<00:03:47.280> lot<00:03:47.459> of

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:47.580 
experience where we can offer a lot of

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:49.520 
experience where we can offer a lot of
depth<00:03:47.790> but<00:03:48.330> it<00:03:48.450> we<00:03:48.750> don't<00:03:48.870> throw<00:03:49.080> things<00:03:49.140> out

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
depth but it we don't throw things out

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:51.020 
depth but it we don't throw things out
of<00:03:49.590> the<00:03:49.709> TV<00:03:49.950> at<00:03:50.250> you<00:03:50.400> when<00:03:50.580> you<00:03:50.670> pull<00:03:50.880> things

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
of the TV at you when you pull things

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.180 
of the TV at you when you pull things
out<00:03:51.239> of<00:03:51.299> the<00:03:51.420> TV<00:03:51.810> that<00:03:52.019> causes<00:03:52.380> you<00:03:52.500> to<00:03:52.680> focus

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
out of the TV that causes you to focus

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:55.220 
out of the TV that causes you to focus
your<00:03:53.370> eyes<00:03:53.519> closer<00:03:54.030> than<00:03:54.390> what<00:03:54.570> your<00:03:54.720> what

difficulty choose to try it at you know
our<00:04:37.020> hope<00:04:37.200> is<00:04:37.440> over<00:04:38.040> time<00:04:38.250> if<00:04:38.550> you<00:04:38.760> start<00:04:38.970> out

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.090 
our hope is over time if you start out

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:40.670 
our hope is over time if you start out
easier<00:04:39.450> difficulty<00:04:40.020> you'll<00:04:40.260> learn<00:04:40.410> the

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:40.680 
easier difficulty you'll learn the

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:42.260 
easier difficulty you'll learn the
gameplay<00:04:41.100> mechanics<00:04:41.610> and<00:04:41.910> learn<00:04:42.240> how

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:42.270 
gameplay mechanics and learn how

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:43.850 
gameplay mechanics and learn how
powerful<00:04:42.780> that<00:04:42.810> it<00:04:43.290> is<00:04:43.410> and<00:04:43.590> you<00:04:43.620> kind<00:04:43.830> of

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:43.860 
powerful that it is and you kind of

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:45.500 
powerful that it is and you kind of
graduate<00:04:44.370> to<00:04:44.550> higher<00:04:44.730> levels<00:04:44.760> of<00:04:45.150> difficulty

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:45.510 
graduate to higher levels of difficulty

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:47.840 
graduate to higher levels of difficulty
and<00:04:45.840> through<00:04:46.530> things<00:04:46.740> like<00:04:46.860> the<00:04:47.310> attachments

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:47.850 
and through things like the attachments

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:49.100 
and through things like the attachments
and<00:04:47.940> then<00:04:48.150> a<00:04:48.180> suit<00:04:48.390> modules<00:04:48.750> you'll<00:04:48.870> go<00:04:48.990> back

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:49.110 
and then a suit modules you'll go back

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:51.140 
and then a suit modules you'll go back
and<00:04:49.350> replay<00:04:49.500> with<00:04:49.920> those<00:04:50.130> and<00:04:50.340> then<00:04:50.850> maybe<00:04:51.060> a

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:51.150 
and replay with those and then maybe a

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:52.790 
and replay with those and then maybe a
harder<00:04:51.480> difficulty<00:04:51.810> is<00:04:52.050> now<00:04:52.170> easier<00:04:52.560> because

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:52.800 
harder difficulty is now easier because

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:54.110 
harder difficulty is now easier because
you<00:04:53.070> have<00:04:53.220> extra<00:04:53.460> tools<00:04:53.730> at<00:04:53.970> your<00:04:54.000> disposal

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.120 
you have extra tools at your disposal

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:55.760 
you have extra tools at your disposal
and<00:04:54.630> you've<00:04:54.780> learned<00:04:54.930> more<00:04:55.110> game<00:04:55.290> mechanics

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:55.770 
and you've learned more game mechanics

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:57.470 
and you've learned more game mechanics
and<00:04:56.010> more<00:04:56.100> ways<00:04:56.280> to<00:04:56.310> set<00:04:56.580> booby<00:04:56.700> traps<00:04:57.090> but<00:04:57.360> if

00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:57.480 
and more ways to set booby traps but if

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:59.060 
and more ways to set booby traps but if
you<00:04:57.570> go<00:04:57.750> to<00:04:57.810> our<00:04:57.900> hardest<00:04:58.290> difficulty<00:04:58.680> level
