00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
time that would look a little place

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:30.590 
time that would look a little place
because<00:02:29.910> they're<00:02:30.060> dressed<00:02:30.270> in<00:02:30.360> white<00:02:30.540> and

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
because they're dressed in white and

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.630 
because they're dressed in white and
they're<00:02:30.900> walking<00:02:31.050> in<00:02:31.320> the<00:02:31.380> crowd<00:02:31.620> right<00:02:31.830> but

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
the way that Connor design I think maybe

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:36.290 
the way that Connor design I think maybe
you<00:02:35.400> didn't<00:02:35.640> see<00:02:35.700> as<00:02:35.910> much<00:02:35.940> here<00:02:36.270> but

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
blends in really well and snow he's got

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:40.940 
blends in really well and snow he's got
the<00:02:39.930> white<00:02:40.080> and<00:02:40.260> he<00:02:40.320> looks<00:02:40.500> like<00:02:40.560> he's<00:02:40.740> at<00:02:40.860> home

in his in his clothes attorney in a
little<00:02:42.480> bit<00:02:42.570> grubby<00:02:42.750> but<00:02:43.500> I<00:02:43.980> think<00:02:44.610> when<00:02:44.910> you

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
little bit grubby but I think when you

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:50.490 
to make him feel at home as well in in

the<00:02:50.700> urban<00:02:51.240> environments<00:02:51.750> and<00:02:51.870> that's<00:02:52.020> why<00:02:52.110> he

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
the urban environments and that's why he

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.949 
the urban environments and that's why he
has<00:02:52.320> also<00:02:52.740> a<00:02:52.890> colonial<00:02:53.430> field<00:02:53.640> to<00:02:53.880> him<00:02:54.060> and<00:02:54.270> his
