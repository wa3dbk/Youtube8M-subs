00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:13.920
 batista70phone friends today vi 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:17.400
 We show the fule glass film with 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.750
 rickler for samsung galaxy s series c 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.869
 as you will have seen in the shock 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.939
 we have different colors black white green 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.800
 and sometimes for those who want to be one 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.760
 film inside with the same 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.070
 features 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.260
 now it has arrived here and now 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.210
 I will show you how to do lucio 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:38.129
 apply it correctly first 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:40.620
 what do you go to pass the cloth 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:49.559
 as you can see we have two panetti 1 web ed 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:52.920
 a dry one before the web that is that 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:59.550
 wet if we want to say so to clean 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:01:01.829
 well operation is essential because if 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.510
 there remains some lucchio rised then it is made 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:08.369
 the air bubble and the skin the film 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:12.890
 does not adhere as it should now go to 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.890
 clean it properly and in the meantime dry it 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:20.549
 I repeat pay close attention to 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:21.840
 this operation because they are formed 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.880
 a bubble means that it was not 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:28.200
 clean well and there are lint underneath 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:30.150
 how the film is adherent if not 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.659
 do well it remains lifted and you can 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:36.900
 maria below then with this sticker 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:42.710
 all happy others are removed 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:42.710
 that they were ok 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:52.229
 and now let's move on to attack the 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:55.950
 first thing the thieves takes off film 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.950
 protective plastichina 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:04.070
 because here you try to center it well at 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:07.190
 first shot 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:09.350
 don't go to lift it or anything else 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:12.070
 if you do it very much 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:12.070
 careful 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:22.150
 ok we are almost at the end of 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:22.150
 operations 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:36.349
 if it should remain a tad air 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:40.879
 in the side parts you must not do 

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:44.349
 nothing else but going to press but if it is 

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:47.379
 applied well you cleaned well first 

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:50.379
 will hardly remain bubbles or 

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:50.379
 whatever 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:56.389
 ok as you can see the film is 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:59.450
 been perfectly applied 

00:02:56.389 --> 00:03:02.030
 now we are going on just for it 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:04.280
 check that there are no problems 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:08.959
 which I note that from a slight 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:12.069
 satin effect in the part that does not 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:15.250
 on glass obviously but on the body 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:19.010
 according to what cell we determine 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:21.290
 you can see that the sensitivity remains 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:25.159
 unchanged there is still no type of 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:27.799
 issue also takes well on the edges 

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:30.980
 various things the key one remains uncovered i 

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:32.840
 but back and menu keys are covered but 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:35.709
 work perfectly we try to 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:40.129
 see the menu button so much that we're there 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:42.349
 ok as you can see the back button 

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:45.109
 working well in the app back button 

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:46.790
 ok as you can see reacts 

00:03:45.109 --> 00:03:48.680
 the dinners are perfectly fine 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:49.530
 kind of late and no need to 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:51.959
 to press 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:54.150
 particular way I repeat you find it 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:56.340
 in our shop if you want there are also 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:58.130
