00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.490 
when I'm filming broke this morning and
in<00:00:11.940> an<00:00:12.059> effort<00:00:12.179> to<00:00:12.450> find<00:00:12.690> a<00:00:12.780> replacement<00:00:12.929> lamp

I<00:00:13.759> apparently<00:00:14.759> decided<00:00:15.089> that<00:00:15.570> the<00:00:15.750> most

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
I apparently decided that the most

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.840 
I apparently decided that the most
vibrant<00:00:16.260> of<00:00:16.619> all<00:00:16.740> lamps<00:00:17.100> in<00:00:17.190> the<00:00:17.220> universe<00:00:17.609> was

vibrant of all lamps in the universe was

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.939 
vibrant of all lamps in the universe was
the<00:00:17.880> best<00:00:18.150> choice<00:00:18.390> so<00:00:19.140> the<00:00:19.320> lighting<00:00:19.529> on<00:00:19.800> this

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
the best choice so the lighting on this

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.670 
the best choice so the lighting on this
episode<00:00:20.220> might<00:00:20.609> be<00:00:20.789> a<00:00:20.820> little<00:00:21.230> intense<00:00:22.230> so

a<00:01:03.000> bit<00:01:03.270> smaller<00:01:03.660> so<00:01:04.559> that<00:01:04.589> it's<00:01:05.010> easier<00:01:05.460> to

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
a bit smaller so that it's easier to

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.820 
a bit smaller so that it's easier to
maintain<00:01:05.729> and<00:01:06.060> easier<00:01:06.659> to<00:01:06.990> know<00:01:07.170> what<00:01:07.200> all<00:01:07.619> is

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
maintain and easier to know what all is

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.370 
maintain and easier to know what all is
going<00:01:08.159> on<00:01:08.310> within<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:08.760> system<00:01:09.150> but<00:01:09.960> I<00:01:09.990> don't

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
going on within the system but I don't

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.200 
going on within the system but I don't
know<00:01:10.530> if<00:01:10.770> that<00:01:11.010> is<00:01:11.250> connected<00:01:11.850> with<00:01:11.880> what's

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
know if that is connected with what's

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.730 
know if that is connected with what's
going<00:01:12.330> on<00:01:12.540> I<00:01:12.900> guess<00:01:13.140> right<00:01:13.380> now<00:01:13.530> they're

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
going on I guess right now they're

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.620 
going on I guess right now they're
hoping<00:01:13.950> to<00:01:14.130> focus<00:01:14.520> a<00:01:14.640> lot<00:01:14.760> on<00:01:14.820> digital<00:01:15.330> games

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
hoping to focus a lot on digital games

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.600 
hoping to focus a lot on digital games
because<00:01:16.439> that<00:01:16.740> way<00:01:16.920> they<00:01:17.130> don't<00:01:17.280> have<00:01:17.400> to

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
because that way they don't have to

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.190 
because that way they don't have to
worry<00:01:17.820> about<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.180> whole<00:01:18.330> retail<00:01:18.780> market<00:01:19.080> at

worry about the whole retail market at
all<00:01:19.290> they<00:01:19.560> can<00:01:19.710> just<00:01:19.860> be<00:01:19.950> like<00:01:20.130> here<00:01:20.369> we<00:01:20.490> made

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
all they can just be like here we made

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
this game go download it they don't have

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.499

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
to worry about manufacturing anything

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:25.940 
to worry about manufacturing anything
beyond<00:01:24.990> that<00:01:25.140> it's<00:01:25.259> probably<00:01:25.409> gonna<00:01:25.590> be<00:01:25.680> safe

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
beyond that it's probably gonna be safe

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.550 
beyond that it's probably gonna be safe
ip's<00:01:26.369> like<00:01:26.720> sonic<00:01:27.720> do<00:01:28.080> you<00:01:28.140> guys<00:01:28.320> remember

when<00:01:28.799> Sega<00:01:29.040> was<00:01:29.189> like<00:01:29.369> a<00:01:29.400> big<00:01:29.700> deal<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:30.240> Sega

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
when Sega was like a big deal the Sega

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.679 
when Sega was like a big deal the Sega
Genesis<00:01:31.049> /<00:01:31.500> Mega<00:01:31.829> Drive<00:01:32.070> was<00:01:32.640> one<00:01:33.570> of<00:01:33.630> my

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
Genesis / Mega Drive was one of my

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:34.999 
Genesis / Mega Drive was one of my
favorite<00:01:34.049> systems<00:01:34.409> of<00:01:34.500> all<00:01:34.590> time<00:01:34.829> I<00:01:34.950> think

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
favorite systems of all time I think

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.130 
favorite systems of all time I think
it's<00:01:35.520> just<00:01:35.700> really<00:01:35.880> sad<00:01:36.240> seeing<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:36.720> company

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
it's just really sad seeing the company

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.890 
it's just really sad seeing the company
get<00:01:37.350> smaller<00:01:37.890> and<00:01:38.220> smaller<00:01:38.520> and<00:01:38.820> smaller<00:01:38.900> so

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
get smaller and smaller and smaller so

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.359 
get smaller and smaller and smaller so
I'm<00:01:40.020> hoping<00:01:40.350> that<00:01:40.409> they<00:01:40.650> reach<00:01:40.799> a<00:01:40.950> point<00:01:41.159> where

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
I'm hoping that they reach a point where

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.219 
I'm hoping that they reach a point where
they<00:01:41.460> feel<00:01:41.490> like<00:01:41.880> everything<00:01:42.420> is<00:01:42.689> kind<00:01:43.079> of<00:01:43.110> in

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
they feel like everything is kind of in

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.679 
they feel like everything is kind of in
harmony<00:01:43.710> and<00:01:44.040> then<00:01:44.700> they<00:01:44.850> can<00:01:45.060> build<00:01:45.299> up<00:01:45.479> from

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
harmony and then they can build up from

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:46.969 
harmony and then they can build up from
there<00:01:45.780> again<00:01:46.079> which<00:01:46.409> i<00:01:46.500> think<00:01:46.680> is<00:01:46.799> what

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
there again which i think is what

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.770 
there again which i think is what
they're<00:01:47.159> trying<00:01:47.549> to<00:01:47.610> do<00:01:47.790> anyway<00:01:48.090> so<00:01:48.540> we

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
they're trying to do anyway so we

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.899 
they're trying to do anyway so we
haven't<00:01:49.079> talked<00:01:49.530> about<00:01:49.710> God<00:01:50.159> or<00:01:50.520> ascension

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
haven't talked about God or ascension

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.810 
haven't talked about God or ascension
which<00:01:51.890> God<00:01:52.890> war<00:01:53.100> ascension<00:01:53.399> has<00:01:53.640> been

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
which God war ascension has been

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.399 
which God war ascension has been
upsetting<00:01:54.119> people<00:01:54.390> anyway<00:01:54.720> because<00:01:54.869> it<00:01:55.140> is<00:01:55.259> a

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
upsetting people anyway because it is a

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.700 
upsetting people anyway because it is a
pre<00:01:56.009> prequel<00:01:56.700> it<00:01:56.939> is<00:01:57.540> officially<00:01:58.320> the<00:01:58.500> first

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
pre prequel it is officially the first

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.389 
pre prequel it is officially the first
game<00:01:59.250> in<00:01:59.520> the<00:01:59.610> whole<00:01:59.759> series<00:02:00.119> but<00:02:01.310> when<00:02:02.310> you

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
game in the whole series but when you

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:03.410 
game in the whole series but when you
make<00:02:02.490> a<00:02:02.549> prequel<00:02:02.820> and<00:02:03.119> then<00:02:03.210> you<00:02:03.270> make<00:02:03.390> a

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
make a prequel and then you make a

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.149 
make a prequel and then you make a
prequel<00:02:03.750> to<00:02:03.840> the<00:02:03.990> prequel<00:02:04.380> it's<00:02:04.680> just<00:02:04.950> it<00:02:05.130> gets

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
prequel to the prequel it's just it gets

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:08.180 
prequel to the prequel it's just it gets
tedious<00:02:05.790> don't<00:02:06.450> get<00:02:06.540> me<00:02:06.630> wrong<00:02:06.810> I<00:02:07.020> love<00:02:07.619> God<00:02:08.069> of

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
tedious don't get me wrong I love God of

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.380 
tedious don't get me wrong I love God of
war<00:02:08.340> games<00:02:08.580> and<00:02:08.849> I<00:02:08.910> think<00:02:09.149> they<00:02:09.270> are<00:02:09.300> just

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
war games and I think they are just

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.199 
war games and I think they are just
fantastical<00:02:10.319> mindless<00:02:10.709> fun<00:02:10.860> and<00:02:11.160> this<00:02:11.940> game

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
fantastical mindless fun and this game

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.490 
fantastical mindless fun and this game
is<00:02:12.450> going<00:02:12.690> to<00:02:12.750> be<00:02:12.870> adding<00:02:13.200> in

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
is going to be adding in

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.830 
is going to be adding in
multiplayer<00:02:14.190> which<00:02:14.670> might<00:02:15.180> be<00:02:15.420> the<00:02:15.690> new

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
multiplayer which might be the new

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.690 
multiplayer which might be the new
freshness<00:02:16.500> that<00:02:16.740> they've<00:02:16.920> been<00:02:17.100> needing<00:02:17.400> so

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
freshness that they've been needing so

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:18.740 
freshness that they've been needing so
they're<00:02:17.850> hoping<00:02:18.120> with<00:02:18.240> the<00:02:18.360> single-player

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
they're hoping with the single-player

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.540 
they're hoping with the single-player
campaign<00:02:18.840> to<00:02:19.500> kind<00:02:19.680> of<00:02:19.740> showcase<00:02:20.010> the<00:02:20.400> more

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
campaign to kind of showcase the more

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.630 
campaign to kind of showcase the more
human<00:02:21.060> side<00:02:21.330> of<00:02:21.600> Kratos<00:02:22.050> still<00:02:22.860> the<00:02:23.010> anti-hero

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
human side of Kratos still the anti-hero

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.570 
human side of Kratos still the anti-hero
still<00:02:24.240> that<00:02:24.570> guy<00:02:24.870> that<00:02:25.320> we<00:02:25.470> love<00:02:25.860> because<00:02:26.160> he's

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
still that guy that we love because he's

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.090 
still that guy that we love because he's
Kratos<00:02:27.270> but<00:02:28.140> the<00:02:28.650> reason<00:02:28.980> that<00:02:29.010> the

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
Kratos but the reason that the

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.310 
Kratos but the reason that the
multiplayer<00:02:29.610> is<00:02:29.880> more<00:02:30.180> interesting<00:02:30.840> to<00:02:30.870> me<00:02:31.140> is

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.320 
multiplayer is more interesting to me is

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:32.930 
multiplayer is more interesting to me is
because<00:02:31.650> it's<00:02:31.830> going<00:02:31.980> to<00:02:32.070> be<00:02:32.190> detailing<00:02:32.700> the

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
because it's going to be detailing the

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:34.610 
because it's going to be detailing the
war<00:02:33.150> between<00:02:33.540> Sparta<00:02:33.990> and<00:02:34.080> Troy

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
war between Sparta and Troy

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.350 
war between Sparta and Troy
so<00:02:34.770> Polyphemus<00:02:35.400> is<00:02:35.520> all<00:02:35.640> huge<00:02:36.060> and<00:02:36.210> like

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
so Polyphemus is all huge and like

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:37.460 
so Polyphemus is all huge and like
chained<00:02:36.750> up<00:02:36.930> on<00:02:37.080> the<00:02:37.170> side<00:02:37.320> of<00:02:37.350> the

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
chained up on the side of the

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.260 
chained up on the side of the
battlefield<00:02:37.950> and<00:02:38.100> I<00:02:38.190> guess<00:02:38.430> within<00:02:38.670> reason

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
battlefield and I guess within reason

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:40.970 
battlefield and I guess within reason
and<00:02:39.360> within<00:02:39.600> like<00:02:39.870> his<00:02:40.080> arm's<00:02:40.470> reach

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
and within like his arm's reach

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.250 
and within like his arm's reach
he's<00:02:41.310> able<00:02:41.490> to<00:02:41.610> kind<00:02:41.880> of<00:02:41.970> flail<00:02:42.330> and<00:02:42.720> just<00:02:42.990> hit

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
he's able to kind of flail and just hit

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.230 
he's able to kind of flail and just hit
whoever<00:02:43.830> so<00:02:44.490> it<00:02:44.580> kind<00:02:44.760> of<00:02:44.820> adds<00:02:45.030> an

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:45.240 
whoever so it kind of adds an

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.180 
whoever so it kind of adds an
interesting<00:02:45.420> variable<00:02:46.140> that<00:02:46.410> way<00:02:46.650> but

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
interesting variable that way but

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.010 
interesting variable that way but
something<00:02:47.550> that<00:02:47.700> I<00:02:47.910> thought<00:02:48.209> was<00:02:48.360> weird<00:02:48.660> is

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
something that I thought was weird is

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:51.530 
something that I thought was weird is
that<00:02:49.650> you're<00:02:50.190> not<00:02:50.400> supposed<00:02:50.430> to<00:02:51.060> take<00:02:51.330> the

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
that you're not supposed to take the

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.660 
that you're not supposed to take the
storyline<00:02:52.020> of<00:02:52.290> the<00:02:52.770> multiplayer<00:02:53.280> which<00:02:53.490> there

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
storyline of the multiplayer which there

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.160 
storyline of the multiplayer which there
is<00:02:53.790> because<00:02:54.090> it's<00:02:54.240> a<00:02:54.330> war<00:02:54.540> you're<00:02:55.020> not

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
is because it's a war you're not

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.140 
is because it's a war you're not
supposed<00:02:55.530> to<00:02:55.590> consider<00:02:55.980> that<00:02:56.100> as<00:02:56.459> part<00:02:57.120> of

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
supposed to consider that as part of

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:01.130 
supposed to consider that as part of
cannon<00:02:57.600> in<00:02:57.840> other<00:02:58.650> words<00:02:59.420> it's<00:03:00.420> not<00:03:00.510> canonical

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
cannon in other words it's not canonical

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.290 
cannon in other words it's not canonical
because<00:03:01.260> they<00:03:02.070> don't<00:03:02.340> want<00:03:02.610> you<00:03:02.790> to<00:03:02.970> assume

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:03.300 
because they don't want you to assume

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:04.820 
because they don't want you to assume
that<00:03:03.540> everything<00:03:04.050> that's<00:03:04.230> going<00:03:04.500> on<00:03:04.590> in

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830 
that everything that's going on in

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:09.320 
that everything that's going on in
multiplayer<00:03:07.160> exists<00:03:08.160> within<00:03:08.370> the<00:03:08.670> actual<00:03:09.030> god

of<00:03:09.480> war<00:03:09.630> universe<00:03:09.959> I<00:03:10.470> don't<00:03:10.740> know<00:03:10.800> why<00:03:10.920> that<00:03:11.100> is

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
of war universe I don't know why that is

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.370 
of war universe I don't know why that is
because<00:03:11.580> in<00:03:11.700> a<00:03:11.790> series<00:03:12.090> of<00:03:12.240> games<00:03:12.480> the<00:03:13.200> best

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:34.019 
franchise that kind of needed something

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:36.620 
franchise that kind of needed something
new<00:03:34.320> to<00:03:34.950> make<00:03:35.160> people<00:03:35.580> play<00:03:35.850> the<00:03:36.060> newest<00:03:36.420> game

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630 
new to make people play the newest game

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:38.360 
new to make people play the newest game
feel<00:03:37.170> like<00:03:37.290> it<00:03:37.410> would<00:03:37.500> be<00:03:37.590> God<00:03:37.739> of<00:03:37.769> War<00:03:38.070> because

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
feel like it would be God of War because

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:42.259 
feel like it would be God of War because
God<00:03:38.580> of<00:03:38.700> War<00:03:38.820> is<00:03:38.880> a<00:03:39.090> lot<00:03:39.510> of<00:03:39.870> repetition<00:03:40.560> and<00:03:41.340> in

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:42.269 
God of War is a lot of repetition and in

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:44.240 
God of War is a lot of repetition and in
order<00:03:42.510> for<00:03:42.660> them<00:03:42.780> to<00:03:42.810> even<00:03:43.260> make<00:03:43.709> another<00:03:44.010> game

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
order for them to even make another game

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:47.390 
order for them to even make another game
it<00:03:44.430> had<00:03:44.640> to<00:03:44.820> be<00:03:44.940> a<00:03:45.150> pretty<00:03:45.720> prequel<00:03:46.320> so<00:03:46.980> adding

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
it had to be a pretty prequel so adding

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:48.920 
it had to be a pretty prequel so adding
in<00:03:47.489> multiplayer<00:03:47.820> gives<00:03:48.239> you<00:03:48.360> something<00:03:48.630> else

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
in multiplayer gives you something else

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:50.960 
in multiplayer gives you something else
to<00:03:49.200> do<00:03:49.410> with<00:03:49.560> it<00:03:49.799> as<00:03:50.010> I<00:03:50.250> find<00:03:50.430> a<00:03:50.549> bit<00:03:50.700> of<00:03:50.730> news

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
to do with it as I find a bit of news

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:54.140 
to do with it as I find a bit of news
everyone<00:03:51.870> has<00:03:52.230> believed<00:03:52.739> for<00:03:53.220> a<00:03:53.280> long<00:03:53.760> time

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
everyone has believed for a long time

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.990 
everyone has believed for a long time
now<00:03:54.360> that<00:03:54.739> timesplitters<00:03:55.739> 4<00:03:56.070> is<00:03:56.370> in

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
now that timesplitters 4 is in

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.350 
now that timesplitters 4 is in
development<00:03:58.100> apparently<00:03:59.100> it's<00:03:59.310> not<00:03:59.430> at<00:04:00.000> all

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:00.360 
development apparently it's not at all

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:03.050 
development apparently it's not at all
Crytek<00:04:01.019> confirmed<00:04:01.560> it<00:04:01.769> it's<00:04:02.070> very<00:04:02.340> sad<00:04:02.730> I

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
Crytek confirmed it it's very sad I

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:04.490 
Crytek confirmed it it's very sad I
think<00:04:03.299> the<00:04:03.690> thing<00:04:03.870> that's<00:04:03.900> really<00:04:04.290> confusing

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
think the thing that's really confusing

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:08.990 
think the thing that's really confusing
is<00:04:05.250> that<00:04:06.080> even<00:04:07.080> in<00:04:07.200> like<00:04:07.410> 2010<00:04:08.310> I<00:04:08.340> believe<00:04:08.700> they

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
is that even in like 2010 I believe they

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.970 
is that even in like 2010 I believe they
were<00:04:09.420> talking<00:04:09.870> to<00:04:09.959> publishers<00:04:10.470> saying<00:04:10.739> hey

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
were talking to publishers saying hey

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:12.800 
were talking to publishers saying hey
we'd<00:04:11.130> really<00:04:11.370> like<00:04:11.489> to<00:04:11.670> make<00:04:11.820> this<00:04:12.060> but<00:04:12.780> I

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
we'd really like to make this but I

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:15.110 
we'd really like to make this but I
guess<00:04:13.049> it<00:04:13.260> literally<00:04:13.920> never<00:04:14.130> went<00:04:14.489> anywhere

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 
guess it literally never went anywhere

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.120 
guess it literally never went anywhere
they<00:04:15.420> had<00:04:15.660> concept<00:04:16.530> art<00:04:16.769> that<00:04:16.979> they<00:04:17.070> were

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
they had concept art that they were

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:18.740 
they had concept art that they were
trying<00:04:17.430> to<00:04:17.580> push<00:04:17.850> and<00:04:18.120> they<00:04:18.180> were<00:04:18.269> talking

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
trying to push and they were talking

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:20.900 
trying to push and they were talking
with<00:04:18.870> people<00:04:19.169> to<00:04:19.320> possibly<00:04:19.739> make<00:04:19.979> it<00:04:20.160> and<00:04:20.430> it

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:20.910 
with people to possibly make it and it

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:22.610 
with people to possibly make it and it
just<00:04:20.940> never<00:04:21.239> happened<00:04:21.780> does<00:04:22.109> that<00:04:22.320> mean<00:04:22.470> they

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
just never happened does that mean they

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:24.589 
just never happened does that mean they
wouldn't<00:04:22.860> like<00:04:23.190> to<00:04:23.220> I'm<00:04:23.820> sure<00:04:24.180> they'd<00:04:24.360> love<00:04:24.539> to

00:04:24.589 --> 00:04:24.599 
wouldn't like to I'm sure they'd love to

00:04:24.599 --> 00:04:25.700 
wouldn't like to I'm sure they'd love to
make<00:04:24.900> it<00:04:25.110> I<00:04:25.289> mean<00:04:25.470> they

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:25.710 
make it I mean they

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:28.070 
make it I mean they
they<00:04:26.039> spent<00:04:26.340> the<00:04:26.490> time<00:04:26.669> to<00:04:27.600> discuss<00:04:27.930> the

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:28.080 
they spent the time to discuss the

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:29.870 
they spent the time to discuss the
possibility<00:04:28.680> of<00:04:28.710> making<00:04:29.160> it<00:04:29.310> so<00:04:29.699> I'm<00:04:29.850> sure

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:29.880 
possibility of making it so I'm sure

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:32.719 
possibility of making it so I'm sure
that<00:04:30.330> it's<00:04:30.479> on<00:04:30.810> their<00:04:31.410> docket<00:04:31.949> of<00:04:32.160> possible
