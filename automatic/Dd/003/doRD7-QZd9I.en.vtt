one<00:00:29.340> full<00:00:29.369> power<00:00:30.300> shot<00:00:30.900> of<00:00:31.140> this<00:00:31.320> because<00:00:31.560> I

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
one full power shot of this because I

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:32.930 
one full power shot of this because I
hate<00:00:31.769> being<00:00:31.980> in<00:00:32.070> the<00:00:32.160> field<00:00:32.369> and<00:00:32.669> I<00:00:32.759> got<00:00:32.910> a

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
hate being in the field and I got a

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.880 
hate being in the field and I got a
hookup<00:00:33.300> a<00:00:33.480> rig<00:00:33.719> like<00:00:33.750> this<00:00:34.140> with<00:00:34.350> one<00:00:34.380> two

hookup a rig like this with one two
maybe<00:00:35.219> even<00:00:35.340> three<00:00:35.550> speed<00:00:36.030> lights<00:00:36.270> to<00:00:36.690> get<00:00:36.809> the

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
maybe even three speed lights to get the

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.650 
maybe even three speed lights to get the
same<00:00:37.200> shot<00:00:37.590> as<00:00:37.800> this<00:00:38.250> can<00:00:38.579> with<00:00:38.940> one<00:00:39.300> mono

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
same shot as this can with one mono

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.299 
same shot as this can with one mono
light<00:00:39.899> one<00:00:40.230> connection<00:00:40.649> you<00:00:40.890> know<00:00:40.980> I'm<00:00:41.100> saying

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
light one connection you know I'm saying

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.270 
light one connection you know I'm saying
so<00:00:41.520> that's<00:00:41.940> the<00:00:42.149> reason<00:00:42.600> why<00:00:43.050> I<00:00:43.079> got<00:00:43.559> this<00:00:43.980> mono

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
so that's the reason why I got this mono

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.040 
so that's the reason why I got this mono
light<00:00:44.460> so<00:00:44.640> to<00:00:44.670> do<00:00:44.910> this<00:00:45.090> test<00:00:45.360> I<00:00:45.570> have<00:00:45.930> this

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
light so to do this test I have this

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.920 
light so to do this test I have this
iconic<00:00:46.410> Elle<00:00:46.710> 358<00:00:47.489> light<00:00:47.760> meter<00:00:48.030> I<00:00:48.329> have<00:00:48.660> each

studio<00:00:51.620> wireless<00:00:52.620> trigger<00:00:53.129> here's<00:00:53.850> the

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
studio wireless trigger here's the

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.060 
studio wireless trigger here's the
trigger<00:00:54.239> right<00:00:54.420> here<00:00:54.480> in<00:00:54.750> my<00:00:54.870> hand<00:00:55.170> and<00:00:55.440> I<00:00:55.860> have

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
trigger right here in my hand and I have

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.760 
trigger right here in my hand and I have
this<00:00:56.579> right<00:00:57.420> here<00:00:57.480> marked<00:00:58.109> off<00:00:58.289> about<00:00:58.530> eight

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
this right here marked off about eight

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.770 
this right here marked off about eight
feet<00:00:59.070> it's<00:00:59.250> about<00:00:59.370> eight<00:00:59.579> feet<00:00:59.789> away<00:00:59.940> so<00:01:00.390> we

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
feet it's about eight feet away so we

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.680 
feet it's about eight feet away so we
can<00:01:00.899> keep<00:01:01.109> it<00:01:01.320> a<00:01:01.579> consistent<00:01:02.579> distance<00:01:02.879> to

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
can keep it a consistent distance to

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.109 
can keep it a consistent distance to
each<00:01:03.719> one<00:01:04.199> so<00:01:04.229> what<00:01:04.949> we<00:01:05.040> gonna<00:01:05.159> test<00:01:05.489> first<00:01:05.790> is

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
each one so what we gonna test first is

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.679 
each one so what we gonna test first is
the<00:01:06.439> sb-700<00:01:07.439> all<00:01:07.950> by<00:01:08.130> itself<00:01:08.700> let<00:01:09.330> me<00:01:09.420> get<00:01:09.540> that

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
the sb-700 all by itself let me get that

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.880 
the sb-700 all by itself let me get that
going<00:01:10.350> alright<00:01:11.130> and<00:01:11.630> let's<00:01:12.630> see<00:01:12.840> how<00:01:12.990> powerful

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
going alright and let's see how powerful

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:24.410 
going alright and let's see how powerful
that<00:01:13.920> is<00:01:14.189> I'll<00:01:14.310> test<00:01:14.549> that<00:01:14.760> first<00:01:15.030> then<00:01:15.509> SB<00:01:22.939> 807

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
that is I'll test that first then SB 807

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.240 
that is I'll test that first then SB 807
a<00:01:25.159> I<00:01:26.159> got<00:01:26.369> that<00:01:26.520> at<00:01:26.610> f13<00:01:27.450> okay<00:01:27.930> my<00:01:28.110> ISO<00:01:28.560> is<00:01:28.619> 100

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
a I got that at f13 okay my ISO is 100

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.130 
a I got that at f13 okay my ISO is 100
and<00:01:29.369> a<00:01:29.850> shutter<00:01:30.119> speed<00:01:30.210> of<00:01:30.360> 250<00:01:30.869> that's<00:01:31.020> like

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
and a shutter speed of 250 that's like

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.280 
and a shutter speed of 250 that's like
my<00:01:31.259> camera's<00:01:31.590> sync<00:01:31.799> speed<00:01:32.070> so<00:01:32.549> that's<00:01:32.670> a<00:01:33.290> f13

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
my camera's sync speed so that's a f13

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:43.249 
my camera's sync speed so that's a f13
on<00:01:34.369> sb-700<00:01:35.369> let's<00:01:35.850> turn<00:01:36.030> on<00:01:36.150> the<00:01:36.180> SV<00:01:41.540> 800k<00:01:42.540> DSP

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
on sb-700 let's turn on the SV 800k DSP

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:48.080 
on sb-700 let's turn on the SV 800k DSP
800<00:01:44.119> same<00:01:45.119> test<00:01:46.520> I'm<00:01:47.520> kind<00:01:47.729> of<00:01:47.820> letting<00:01:48.030> the

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
800 same test I'm kind of letting the

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.230 
800 same test I'm kind of letting the
power<00:01:48.360> up<00:01:48.570> I<00:01:48.689> still<00:01:48.869> kind<00:01:49.110> of<00:01:49.140> hear<00:01:49.290> it<00:01:49.409> humming

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 
power up I still kind of hear it humming

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:55.819 
power up I still kind of hear it humming
alright<00:01:51.240> here<00:01:51.450> we<00:01:51.479> go<00:01:53.119> okay<00:01:54.119> that's<00:01:54.270> a<00:01:54.829> f-14

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
alright here we go okay that's a f-14

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.969 
alright here we go okay that's a f-14
f-14<00:01:56.729> on<00:01:56.759> that<00:01:57.090> F<00:01:57.750> 13<00:01:58.290> or<00:01:58.409> not<00:01:58.530> so<00:01:58.710> this<00:01:58.799> is

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
f-14 on that F 13 or not so this is

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.830 
f-14 on that F 13 or not so this is
actually<00:01:59.310> just<00:01:59.460> slightly<00:01:59.880> more<00:02:00.060> powerful

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
actually just slightly more powerful

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.550 
actually just slightly more powerful
than<00:02:01.680> the<00:02:02.180> sb-700<00:02:03.180> now<00:02:03.810> let's<00:02:04.020> do<00:02:04.140> them<00:02:04.229> both

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
than the sb-700 now let's do them both

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.520 
than the sb-700 now let's do them both
together<00:02:05.719> so<00:02:06.719> I'm<00:02:06.810> going<00:02:07.020> to<00:02:07.049> go<00:02:07.200> ahead<00:02:07.259> and

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
together so I'm going to go ahead and

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:16.780 
together so I'm going to go ahead and
fire<00:02:07.799> up<00:02:08.009> the<00:02:08.129> sb-700<00:02:08.849> and<00:02:09.239> SB<00:02:09.720> 800

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:20.599 

okay<00:02:17.790> I<00:02:17.819> got<00:02:18.049> f-18<00:02:19.049> f-18<00:02:19.980> for<00:02:20.219> both<00:02:20.370> of<00:02:20.519> these

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:20.609 
okay I got f-18 f-18 for both of these

00:02:20.609 --> 00:02:23.229 
okay I got f-18 f-18 for both of these
together<00:02:20.790> now<00:02:21.120> I'm<00:02:21.209> gonna<00:02:21.329> turn<00:02:21.689> these<00:02:21.930> off

00:02:23.229 --> 00:02:23.239 
together now I'm gonna turn these off

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:30.199 
together now I'm gonna turn these off
and<00:02:24.409> turn<00:02:25.409> on<00:02:25.709> the<00:02:26.370> mana<00:02:26.609> light<00:02:26.939> I<00:02:28.879> have<00:02:29.879> to<00:02:29.909> set

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209 
and turn on the mana light I have to set

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:32.959 
and turn on the mana light I have to set
at<00:02:30.329> full<00:02:30.599> power<00:02:30.840> so<00:02:31.260> this<00:02:31.799> is<00:02:31.950> it<00:02:32.189> it's<00:02:32.700> got<00:02:32.849> to

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:32.969 
at full power so this is it it's got to

00:02:32.969 --> 00:02:44.539 
at full power so this is it it's got to
be<00:02:33.000> the<00:02:33.120> f-18<00:02:39.409> f-18<00:02:40.409> so<00:02:42.319> so<00:02:43.319> it's<00:02:43.680> exactly<00:02:44.250> the

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:44.549 
be the f-18 f-18 so so it's exactly the

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:47.240 
be the f-18 f-18 so so it's exactly the
same<00:02:44.819> so<00:02:45.120> basically<00:02:45.629> this<00:02:46.500> model<00:02:46.769> like<00:02:47.099> this

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
same so basically this model like this

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:48.830 
same so basically this model like this
is<00:02:47.310> a<00:02:47.370> 600<00:02:47.879> watt<00:02:47.909> second<00:02:48.329> model<00:02:48.540> light<00:02:48.689> the

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
is a 600 watt second model light the

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.780 
is a 600 watt second model light the
flashpoint<00:02:49.189> 620<00:02:50.189> M<00:02:51.319> on<00:02:52.319> full<00:02:52.680> power<00:02:52.950> will<00:02:53.639> get

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
flashpoint 620 M on full power will get

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:57.559 
flashpoint 620 M on full power will get
you<00:02:53.939> the<00:02:54.060> same<00:02:54.090> as<00:02:54.659> the<00:02:55.079> sb-700<00:02:55.859> NSBA<00:02:56.849> 800

00:02:57.559 --> 00:02:57.569 
you the same as the sb-700 NSBA 800

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:59.869 
you the same as the sb-700 NSBA 800
together<00:02:57.930> full<00:02:58.709> power<00:02:58.980> these<00:02:59.219> are<00:02:59.400> full<00:02:59.609> power

00:02:59.869 --> 00:02:59.879 
together full power these are full power

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:03.349 
together full power these are full power
and<00:03:00.269> they<00:03:00.689> also<00:03:00.930> zoom<00:03:01.439> to<00:03:01.829> the<00:03:01.919> max<00:03:02.189> so<00:03:02.849> that's

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:03.359 
and they also zoom to the max so that's

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:05.479 
and they also zoom to the max so that's
the<00:03:03.540> test<00:03:03.719> I<00:03:03.810> wanted<00:03:04.049> to<00:03:04.139> do<00:03:04.319> so<00:03:04.769> this<00:03:05.099> should
