00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:07.030 

I<00:00:04.490> think<00:00:05.360> the<00:00:05.450> most<00:00:05.750> satisfying<00:00:06.320> element<00:00:06.920> is

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:07.040 
I think the most satisfying element is

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:08.470 
I think the most satisfying element is
is<00:00:07.250> the<00:00:07.490> way<00:00:07.610> that<00:00:07.790> everything<00:00:08.029> came<00:00:08.330> together

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:08.480 
is the way that everything came together

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:11.350 
is the way that everything came together
I<00:00:08.750> mean<00:00:08.960> every<00:00:09.770> system<00:00:10.490> in<00:00:10.580> this<00:00:10.730> car<00:00:10.940> has<00:00:11.210> been

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:11.360 
I mean every system in this car has been

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:12.670 
I mean every system in this car has been
greatly<00:00:11.630> improved<00:00:12.110> so<00:00:12.290> whether<00:00:12.440> it's<00:00:12.620> the

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:12.680 
greatly improved so whether it's the

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:14.500 
greatly improved so whether it's the
driving<00:00:13.070> dynamics<00:00:13.549> whether<00:00:14.090> it's<00:00:14.270> a<00:00:14.330> fuel

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:14.510 
driving dynamics whether it's a fuel

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:16.570 
driving dynamics whether it's a fuel
economy<00:00:14.750> to<00:00:15.049> power<00:00:15.230> it<00:00:15.889> doesn't<00:00:16.129> matter

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:16.580 
economy to power it doesn't matter

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:19.689 
economy to power it doesn't matter
we've<00:00:17.180> improved<00:00:17.330> every<00:00:18.140> aspect<00:00:18.800> of<00:00:18.920> the<00:00:19.220> 2015

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:19.699 
we've improved every aspect of the 2015

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:21.849 
we've improved every aspect of the 2015
Mustang<00:00:20.060> the<00:00:20.869> EcoBoost<00:00:21.199> engine<00:00:21.529> is<00:00:21.619> a<00:00:21.650> true

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:21.859 
Mustang the EcoBoost engine is a true

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:23.290 
Mustang the EcoBoost engine is a true
game<00:00:22.099> changer<00:00:22.130> and<00:00:22.580> I<00:00:22.609> think<00:00:22.820> that<00:00:22.939> we're

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:23.300 
game changer and I think that we're

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.300 
game changer and I think that we're
surprising<00:00:23.630> a<00:00:23.810> lot<00:00:23.960> of<00:00:24.080> people<00:00:24.349> with<00:00:24.890> a<00:00:24.920> with<00:00:25.279> a

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:25.310 
surprising a lot of people with a with a

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:26.679 
surprising a lot of people with a with a
four-cylinder<00:00:25.849> engine<00:00:26.060> that's<00:00:26.179> putting<00:00:26.599> out

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:26.689 
four-cylinder engine that's putting out

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:28.929 
four-cylinder engine that's putting out
310<00:00:27.529> horsepower

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:28.939 
310 horsepower

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:30.909 
310 horsepower
we<00:00:29.330> are<00:00:29.419> definitely<00:00:29.599> redefining<00:00:30.349> what

00:00:30.909 --> 00:00:30.919 
we are definitely redefining what

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:33.520 
we are definitely redefining what
performance<00:00:31.339> means<00:00:31.640> with<00:00:32.240> smaller<00:00:32.630> engines

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:33.530 
performance means with smaller engines

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:35.650 
performance means with smaller engines
and<00:00:33.710> really<00:00:34.640> proud<00:00:34.820> of<00:00:35.000> how<00:00:35.090> it<00:00:35.120> performs<00:00:35.570> and

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:35.660 
and really proud of how it performs and

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:37.540 
and really proud of how it performs and

left and right hand drive it's an

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:11.009 
left and right hand drive it's an
exciting<00:02:09.979> time<00:02:10.009> to<00:02:10.190> be<00:02:10.310> part<00:02:10.519> of<00:02:10.580> Mustang

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:11.019 
exciting time to be part of Mustang

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:12.910 
exciting time to be part of Mustang
starting<00:02:12.019> out<00:02:12.140> I<00:02:12.170> mean<00:02:12.349> the<00:02:12.439> independent<00:02:12.829> rear

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
starting out I mean the independent rear

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.250 
starting out I mean the independent rear
suspension<00:02:12.950> I<00:02:13.459> think<00:02:13.670> was<00:02:13.790> critical<00:02:14.230> not<00:02:15.230> only

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
suspension I think was critical not only

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:16.959 
suspension I think was critical not only
to<00:02:15.499> continuing<00:02:16.340> to<00:02:16.430> improve<00:02:16.549> the<00:02:16.939> overall

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:16.969 
to continuing to improve the overall

00:02:16.969 --> 00:02:18.130 
to continuing to improve the overall
performance<00:02:17.329> of<00:02:17.659> the<00:02:17.749> car

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
performance of the car

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.080 
performance of the car
but<00:02:18.470> to<00:02:18.560> make<00:02:18.680> it<00:02:18.710> credible<00:02:18.980> globally<00:02:19.819> and<00:02:20.030> so

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
but to make it credible globally and so

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.720 
but to make it credible globally and so
that's<00:02:20.720> that's<00:02:20.990> a<00:02:21.230> huge<00:02:21.530> huge<00:02:22.040> benefit<00:02:22.370> the

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
that's that's a huge huge benefit the

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:24.490 
that's that's a huge huge benefit the
brake<00:02:22.970> system<00:02:23.270> was<00:02:23.660> really<00:02:24.020> important

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
brake system was really important

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.920 
brake system was really important
Mustang<00:02:25.160> has<00:02:25.310> always<00:02:25.520> needed<00:02:26.330> to<00:02:26.420> have<00:02:26.600> a<00:02:26.630> bit

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
Mustang has always needed to have a bit

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.350 
Mustang has always needed to have a bit
more<00:02:26.959> braking<00:02:27.920> capability<00:02:28.490> and<00:02:28.670> this<00:02:29.090> car<00:02:29.330> has

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
more braking capability and this car has

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.449 
more braking capability and this car has
all<00:02:29.900> of<00:02:29.930> that<00:02:30.050> and<00:02:30.709> of<00:02:30.800> course<00:02:30.980> obviously<00:02:31.160> the

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:31.459 
all of that and of course obviously the

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:33.699 
all of that and of course obviously the
performance<00:02:31.760> I<00:02:32.030> mean<00:02:32.060> 435<00:02:33.020> horsepower<00:02:33.350> and<00:02:33.620> a

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:33.709 
performance I mean 435 horsepower and a

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:36.850 
performance I mean 435 horsepower and a
GT<00:02:34.040> it's<00:02:34.580> the<00:02:34.760> highest<00:02:35.300> performing<00:02:35.930> GT<00:02:36.440> in<00:02:36.680> our

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
GT it's the highest performing GT in our

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:39.190 
GT it's the highest performing GT in our
history<00:02:37.280> and<00:02:37.520> so<00:02:38.150> to<00:02:38.209> be<00:02:38.390> a<00:02:38.420> part<00:02:38.690> of<00:02:38.780> that<00:02:38.959> at

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
history and so to be a part of that at

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.530 
history and so to be a part of that at
the<00:02:39.500> fifty<00:02:39.740> year<00:02:39.950> it's<00:02:40.400> pretty<00:02:40.550> cool<00:02:40.790> this<00:02:41.300> is

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
the fifty year it's pretty cool this is

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:44.170 
the fifty year it's pretty cool this is
probably<00:02:41.990> the<00:02:42.230> best<00:02:42.530> example<00:02:43.220> of<00:02:43.400> a<00:02:43.820> good

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 
probably the best example of a good

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.180 
probably the best example of a good
collaboration<00:02:44.660> between<00:02:44.870> the<00:02:45.620> design<00:02:45.920> team

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
collaboration between the design team

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:47.949 
collaboration between the design team
and<00:02:46.340> the<00:02:46.430> engineering<00:02:46.850> team<00:02:47.030> I<00:02:47.150> mean<00:02:47.300> we<00:02:47.750> work

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:47.959 
and the engineering team I mean we work

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:49.720 
and the engineering team I mean we work
together<00:02:48.140> for<00:02:48.440> the<00:02:48.530> same<00:02:48.739> goal<00:02:48.770> we<00:02:49.489> helped

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
together for the same goal we helped
