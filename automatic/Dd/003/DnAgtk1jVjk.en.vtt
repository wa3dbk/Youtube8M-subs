00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
last week and the tool talk show and

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.760 
last week and the tool talk show and
today<00:01:05.460> we've<00:01:05.729> got<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.780> compact<00:01:07.500> laser

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
today we've got the compact laser

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.890 
today we've got the compact laser
measuring<00:01:08.340> tool<00:01:08.729> and<00:01:09.000> it's<00:01:09.299> pretty<00:01:09.479> cool<00:01:09.750> it's

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
measuring tool and it's pretty cool it's

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:10.580 
measuring tool and it's pretty cool it's
simple

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
simple

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.859 
simple
don't<00:01:10.950> expect<00:01:11.280> it<00:01:11.430> to<00:01:11.460> be<00:01:11.520> doing<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:12.090> you<00:01:12.750> know

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
don't expect it to be doing the you know

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.109 
don't expect it to be doing the you know
area<00:01:13.770> it<00:01:14.280> does<00:01:14.490> do<00:01:14.670> area

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
area it does do area

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.090 
area it does do area
well<00:01:15.240> the<00:01:15.390> whatever<00:01:15.810> it<00:01:16.140> what's<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:16.830> start<00:01:17.040> of

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
well the whatever it what's the start of

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.789 
well the whatever it what's the start of
the<00:01:17.159> P<00:01:17.369> pie<00:01:17.939> gorath<00:01:18.330> on<00:01:18.509> theory<00:01:18.930> all<00:01:19.320> that

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
the P pie gorath on theory all that

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.510 
the P pie gorath on theory all that
stuff<00:01:20.220> so<00:01:20.720> it's<00:01:21.720> very<00:01:21.960> simple<00:01:22.619> and<00:01:23.040> simplistic

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
stuff so it's very simple and simplistic

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:24.859 
stuff so it's very simple and simplistic
it's<00:01:23.880> good<00:01:24.060> for<00:01:24.270> someone<00:01:24.479> who<00:01:24.659> wants

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
it's good for someone who wants

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.600 
it's good for someone who wants
something<00:01:25.049> thin<00:01:25.470> just<00:01:26.040> to<00:01:26.189> keep<00:01:26.310> in<00:01:26.490> their

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
something thin just to keep in their

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:27.710 
something thin just to keep in their
pocket<00:01:26.909> they<00:01:26.970> don't<00:01:27.090> need<00:01:27.150> something<00:01:27.540> big

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
pocket they don't need something big

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:28.640 
pocket they don't need something big
they<00:01:27.900> don't<00:01:27.930> need<00:01:28.080> all<00:01:28.229> those<00:01:28.320> different

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
they don't need all those different

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.170 
they don't need all those different
measurements<00:01:29.100> someone<00:01:29.759> who's<00:01:29.880> doing<00:01:29.970> like

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
measurements someone who's doing like

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.940 
measurements someone who's doing like
fluorine<00:01:30.540> wallcovering<00:01:31.439> you<00:01:31.590> know<00:01:31.710> if<00:01:31.799> you're

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
fluorine wallcovering you know if you're

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.109 
fluorine wallcovering you know if you're
doing<00:01:32.189> you're<00:01:32.400> measuring<00:01:32.640> your<00:01:32.729> pain<00:01:33.000> how

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
doing you're measuring your pain how

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.080 
doing you're measuring your pain how
much<00:01:33.210> paint<00:01:33.479> you<00:01:33.570> need<00:01:33.780> or<00:01:34.170> flooring

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.090 
much paint you need or flooring

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.609 
much paint you need or flooring
carpeting<00:01:36.090> whatever<00:01:36.479> something<00:01:37.229> like<00:01:37.409> that

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
carpeting whatever something like that

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.100 
carpeting whatever something like that
and<00:01:37.920> this<00:01:38.430> one's<00:01:38.670> actually<00:01:38.909> measures<00:01:39.570> up<00:01:39.810> to<00:01:40.079> a

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
and this one's actually measures up to a

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.230 
and this one's actually measures up to a
thousand<00:01:40.740> was<00:01:40.920> it<00:01:41.070> a<00:01:41.100> thousand<00:01:41.460> feet<00:01:41.579> right<00:01:41.759> no

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
thousand was it a thousand feet right no

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.330 
thousand was it a thousand feet right no
a<00:01:42.450> hundred<00:01:42.600> feet<00:01:42.869> what<00:01:43.770> is<00:01:43.829> it<00:01:43.920> a<00:01:43.950> hundred<00:01:44.220> feet

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
a hundred feet what is it a hundred feet

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.010 
a hundred feet what is it a hundred feet
a<00:01:44.490> hundred<00:01:45.030> feet<00:01:45.180> thousand<00:01:45.600> feet<00:01:45.750> one<00:01:45.869> I<00:01:45.899> think

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
a hundred feet thousand feet one I think

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.420 
a hundred feet thousand feet one I think
at<00:01:46.290> an<00:01:46.560> eighth<00:01:46.710> of<00:01:46.829> an<00:01:46.950> inch

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
at an eighth of an inch

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.840 
at an eighth of an inch
yeah<00:01:47.880> right<00:01:48.210> now<00:01:48.329> you're<00:01:48.509> like<00:01:48.659> Anthony<00:01:49.850> let

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
yeah right now you're like Anthony let
