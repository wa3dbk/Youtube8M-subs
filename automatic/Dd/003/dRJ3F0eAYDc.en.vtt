00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
his but he's pretty straightforward you

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:34.770 
his but he's pretty straightforward you
throw<00:02:28.150> all<00:02:28.240> that<00:02:28.390> in<00:02:28.450> a<00:02:28.630> blender<00:02:29.760> whoa<00:02:33.780> okay

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
throw all that in a blender whoa okay

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:39.090 
throw all that in a blender whoa okay
all<00:02:34.930> done<00:02:35.610> take<00:02:36.610> the<00:02:36.820> lid<00:02:37.060> off<00:02:37.920> again<00:02:38.920> this

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100 
all done take the lid off again this

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:42.000 
all done take the lid off again this
will<00:02:39.340> make<00:02:39.490> willow<00:02:40.050> three<00:02:41.050> or<00:02:41.170> four<00:02:41.470> possibly

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
will make willow three or four possibly

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.060 
will make willow three or four possibly
five<00:02:42.100> I<00:02:42.280> made<00:02:42.520> a<00:02:42.550> lot<00:02:42.790> today<00:02:43.500> it's<00:02:44.500> a<00:02:44.650> little

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:45.070 
five I made a lot today it's a little

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:48.150 
five I made a lot today it's a little
thick<00:02:45.450> so<00:02:46.450> I'm<00:02:47.110> going<00:02:47.290> to<00:02:47.380> stop<00:02:47.620> right<00:02:47.890> there

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160 
thick so I'm going to stop right there

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:49.740 
thick so I'm going to stop right there
if<00:02:48.459> it's<00:02:48.640> too<00:02:48.820> thick<00:02:49.090> you<00:02:49.300> see<00:02:49.480> it's<00:02:49.630> too

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
if it's too thick you see it's too

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:53.160 
if it's too thick you see it's too
chunky<00:02:49.989> for<00:02:50.730> the<00:02:51.730> kids<00:02:52.000> add<00:02:52.270> more<00:02:52.750> milk<00:02:52.989> I

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
chunky for the kids add more milk I

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:54.540 
chunky for the kids add more milk I
think<00:02:53.230> at<00:02:53.410> this<00:02:53.560> point<00:02:53.830> could<00:02:53.950> even<00:02:54.070> add<00:02:54.310> like

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:54.550 
think at this point could even add like

00:02:54.550 --> 00:03:00.360 
think at this point could even add like
water<00:02:54.970> perhaps<00:02:55.510> but<00:02:56.760> whatevs<00:02:57.760> right<00:02:59.310> add<00:03:00.310> a

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 
water perhaps but whatevs right add a

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.000 
water perhaps but whatevs right add a
little<00:03:00.820> more<00:03:01.090> milk<00:03:01.150> then<00:03:01.660> water<00:03:02.350> that<00:03:02.530> down<00:03:02.770> so

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
little more milk then water that down so

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:05.610 
little more milk then water that down so
it's<00:03:03.160> easier<00:03:03.459> because<00:03:03.580> willows<00:03:04.380> still<00:03:05.380> drink

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
it's easier because willows still drink

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:12.930 
it's easier because willows still drink
out<00:03:05.739> of<00:03:05.770> a<00:03:05.890> straw<00:03:09.150> okay<00:03:11.280> there<00:03:12.280> it's<00:03:12.520> a<00:03:12.670> little

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940 
out of a straw okay there it's a little

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:16.770 
out of a straw okay there it's a little
better<00:03:14.670> when<00:03:15.670> the<00:03:15.790> true<00:03:15.970> test<00:03:16.209> will<00:03:16.299> be<00:03:16.540> win

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
better when the true test will be win

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.699 
better when the true test will be win
