00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:07.200
 Excluded incredible babys lips agreement 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:08.849
 it has been around for five years everywhere 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.679
 elsewhere but it just happened at 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.719
 we mean that we make it 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:13.889
 always gets everything after so these are 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:15.420
 baby leafs 1 they are small 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:16.920
 lipstick who are who are 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.960
 moisturizer that are good they are 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:23.310
 cute like everything and we have five 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.750
 and I will present them to you then 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.670
 we are going to discover these 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.230
 wonderful free baby so if I can 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.849
 allow me 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:31.170
 this actually I received them at work 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.510
 here 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.800
 but to send them is why 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.559
 did I have a super nice channel and who 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:40.230
 written bb lips to the first one which is 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.890
 it's here on fishing it's 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.980
 very pleasant 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.850
 I think it's time to yes then 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.350
 this one and nude 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.360
 but it is still slightly iridescent 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.420
 so actually on the lips it's a little 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.399
 a little shiny but discreet shiny it's 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.110
 like like banks like and talk 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:58.500
 skiing but better 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.850
 here he shines a little bit but he is 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.289
 very moisturizing and as you can 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.300
 see it's still a little bit of 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:06.570
 shiny on a work like a little 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.430
 gloss but more enjoyable here it is 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:12.510
 very pretty he is purple I love them 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:14.090
 well, but why did you do a ch'ti 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.350
 ice ax while he's fishing 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:18.869
 noticing this said there is one that is 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.159
 blue what is the ratio fruit the wood 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.439
 the mister freeze is like that the 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:25.640
 blue were chilly wood no this one 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:28.140
 i think it's michael's 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:30.270
 then this one it is with lemon and 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.920
 basil I'm not mistaken that's it 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.930
 so that left her lips 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.340
 incredibly beautiful if he is delighted 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.560
 so here it is tested and approved 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.310
 by michael and that i think it's worth 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.700
 all the gold in the world 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:43.320
 this one 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.820
 the smell is more discreet so it's 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.790
 good for boys in addition and blue 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.869
 that's why I did not understand the blue 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.390
 that means you can put it a 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:53.610
 boy if you want and protects them from 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.770
 sun to 20 twente and by the way it costs 3 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.149
 euros 90 it's cheap so this one 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.549
 so guess what 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.149
 it is orange and yet no it is 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.430
 not then angels 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:04.080
 here we might think that not at all 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.450
 we make jokes hours not at all 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:09.030
 it's cherry aulas and yes because 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.459
 there it's red so this one is a t1 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.959
 here they are very very good so he 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:15.510
 slightly tinted I had it by 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:17.450
 above we will see if it works it works 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.620
 not say it's not tinted at all 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.600
 has tinted slightly 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.040
 good when you are young for young people 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.690
 girls who go to school and who do not 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.700
 not too much right to wear makeup that goes 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.500
 moisturize their lips and make up 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:33.239
 a little bit me that's what I did 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:35.690
 so this one is pink and what is it 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:39.569
 what is it that we say to ourselves 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:40.950
 may be it can be cherry to the 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:44.340
 strawberry something like that 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:46.500
 not at all fruit of passion we are 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:48.120
 well agree that at some point it's 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.950
 completely con still sucks 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.690
 because we actually have our 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.190
 benchmarks good I speak again of mr freeze but 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:54.810
 it's really very important we have our 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.320
 markers taste colors thanks to that since 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:56.640
 childhood 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:01.530
 and there you are in the process of everything 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:03.900
 disturbed this one is the years and 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:07.100
 would appear that is tinted sailboats are 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:09.690
 71 but dad not really anyway 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:11.280
 it's still roses and not 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:13.049
 too much either on the lips my 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.310
 opinion is very very discreet I say 

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:15.989
 I repeat we do not eat his 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.620
 cosmetics him if it's not the 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:18.030
 all my favorite 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.410
 I do not hide from you that I actually 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:21.750
 prefers those who are supposed to be very 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:25.769
 natural and to this one I love them 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:27.359
 alright so wait then we are the one 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:30.720
 it is yellow 

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:34.049
 so I'll let you guess what is 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:38.700
 its yellow scent 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:40.880
 tic tac tick of lemon but not of 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.880
 all 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:48.970
 all the cherries still low cherries 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:51.280
 so it does not smell anything this one is 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:53.610
 supposed to be just moisturizing 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:56.019
 that's okay that's very good cost for 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:56.440
 recapitulate this one it remains my 

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:59.110
 prefer 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:01.599
 that's because it's a little shiny and I 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:04.959
 find it cute and this one is the 

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:08.140
 favorite of michael this is important 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:10.959
 to tell me you've already used some 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:13.000
 babies gibbs it interests me I know that 

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:14.410
 on my facebook page last time 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.359
 the girls advised me to test 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:18.400
 that's also why I wanted the 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:20.799
 do but I actually would like 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:22.360
 know what are you using 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:25.150
 as his for your lips for them 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:26.860
 make beautiful moisturize high school fleshy 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:28.300

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:30.490
 I would like to know and or services 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:31.150
 who could be nice down that would be 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:32.770
 that for example 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:34.000
 well you go on the facebook page and 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:36.130

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.080

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:46.930
 laughter dubois funny it's boring 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:48.190
 finance not boring but it's less 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:50.169
 Funny that if it was funny 

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:51.669
 so maybe we could 

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:53.080
 insert into a video or something in 

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:55.720

 it's here like this 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:36.030
 I find it important all 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:38.460
 circumstances to show the stitches of 

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:40.710
 his teeth I mean we wash them when 

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:45.889
 even three times a day it's not 

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:45.889
 to hide them in his mouth 1 lo
