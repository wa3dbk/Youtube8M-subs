00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
you'll over tighten them and you'll

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.740 
you'll over tighten them and you'll
never<00:01:26.250> get<00:01:26.520> them<00:01:26.640> apart<00:01:26.939> so<00:01:27.119> I'm<00:01:27.450> gonna<00:01:27.570> keep

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
never get them apart so I'm gonna keep

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.300 
never get them apart so I'm gonna keep
working<00:01:28.080> on<00:01:28.170> our<00:01:28.290> whole<00:01:28.470> fuel<00:01:28.740> line<00:01:28.950> system

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
working on our whole fuel line system

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:30.980 
working on our whole fuel line system
here<00:01:29.549> and<00:01:29.759> that<00:01:30.150> will<00:01:30.210> keep<00:01:30.360> we'll<00:01:30.750> be<00:01:30.840> able<00:01:30.900> to

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
here and that will keep we'll be able to

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.780 
here and that will keep we'll be able to
plug<00:01:31.170> it<00:01:31.320> into<00:01:31.439> the<00:01:31.590> carburetor<00:01:31.890> move<00:01:32.490> on<00:01:32.640> to

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
plug it into the carburetor move on to

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.539 
plug it into the carburetor move on to
the<00:01:32.880> next<00:01:33.060> thing<00:01:33.920> one<00:01:34.920> of<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.040> cool<00:01:35.250> things

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
the next thing one of the cool things

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.609 
the next thing one of the cool things
about<00:01:35.700> working<00:01:36.240> on<00:01:36.329> an<00:01:36.479> older<00:01:36.840> cooling<00:01:37.229> system

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
about working on an older cooling system

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.380 
about working on an older cooling system
like<00:01:37.799> this<00:01:37.979> is<00:01:38.220> we've<00:01:38.369> got<00:01:38.490> some<00:01:38.520> flexibility

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
like this is we've got some flexibility

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:40.850 
like this is we've got some flexibility
with<00:01:39.540> some<00:01:39.750> valves<00:01:40.290> now<00:01:40.590> let's<00:01:40.770> say

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
with some valves now let's say

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.140 
with some valves now let's say
hypothetically<00:01:41.130> we<00:01:41.579> needed<00:01:41.790> to<00:01:41.880> take<00:01:42.030> this

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
hypothetically we needed to take this

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.670 
hypothetically we needed to take this
compressor<00:01:42.689> out<00:01:42.720> of<00:01:42.990> the<00:01:43.049> equation<00:01:43.530> for

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
compressor out of the equation for

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.260 
compressor out of the equation for
whatever<00:01:43.829> reason<00:01:44.220> we<00:01:44.340> were<00:01:44.460> gonna<00:01:44.579> service<00:01:45.090> it

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
whatever reason we were gonna service it

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.539 
whatever reason we were gonna service it
it<00:01:45.570> went<00:01:45.840> bad<00:01:46.049> or<00:01:46.320> we<00:01:46.619> just<00:01:46.829> needed<00:01:47.009> access<00:01:47.280> to

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
it went bad or we just needed access to

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:48.830 
it went bad or we just needed access to
some<00:01:47.820> other<00:01:47.970> parts<00:01:48.270> of<00:01:48.360> the<00:01:48.420> engine<00:01:48.570> and<00:01:48.780> we

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
some other parts of the engine and we

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.420 
some other parts of the engine and we
needed<00:01:49.020> it<00:01:49.170> out<00:01:49.320> of<00:01:49.470> the<00:01:49.530> way<00:01:49.680> well<00:01:50.189> you<00:01:50.280> take

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
needed it out of the way well you take

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:51.889 
needed it out of the way well you take
off<00:01:50.640> these<00:01:50.820> little<00:01:51.060> caps<00:01:51.299> right<00:01:51.570> here<00:01:51.720> there's

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
off these little caps right here there's

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.960 
off these little caps right here there's
one<00:01:52.049> right<00:01:52.170> here<00:01:52.229> and<00:01:52.439> one<00:01:52.560> down<00:01:53.070> here<00:01:53.490> and<00:01:53.670> you

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
one right here and one down here and you

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.969 
one right here and one down here and you
can<00:01:54.119> actually<00:01:54.329> move<00:01:54.780> this<00:01:54.990> valve<00:01:55.350> up<00:01:55.740> and

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
can actually move this valve up and

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.310 
can actually move this valve up and
close<00:01:56.490> it<00:01:56.700> on<00:01:56.759> this<00:01:56.939> end<00:01:57.000> and<00:01:57.659> move<00:01:57.840> this<00:01:58.079> valve

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
close it on this end and move this valve

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.170 
close it on this end and move this valve
up<00:01:58.500> and<00:01:58.680> close<00:01:58.890> it<00:01:59.100> on<00:01:59.159> that<00:01:59.399> end<00:01:59.579> and<00:01:59.790> that

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
up and close it on that end and that

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.060 
up and close it on that end and that
shuts<00:02:00.540> off<00:02:00.689> all<00:02:00.990> your<00:02:01.140> coolant<00:02:01.500> in<00:02:01.680> the<00:02:01.829> lines

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
shuts off all your coolant in the lines

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.469 
shuts off all your coolant in the lines
and<00:02:02.399> it's<00:02:02.520> right<00:02:02.700> there<00:02:02.729> so<00:02:03.090> you<00:02:03.149> can<00:02:03.450> take

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
and it's right there so you can take

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.690 
and it's right there so you can take
this<00:02:04.020> compressor<00:02:04.590> out<00:02:04.770> do<00:02:05.250> whatever<00:02:05.399> you've

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
this compressor out do whatever you've

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.550 
this compressor out do whatever you've
got<00:02:05.729> to<00:02:05.909> do<00:02:06.119> with<00:02:06.270> it<00:02:06.420> put<00:02:06.780> it<00:02:06.899> back<00:02:07.079> in<00:02:07.350> and

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
got to do with it put it back in and

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.380 
got to do with it put it back in and
open<00:02:08.069> up<00:02:08.129> the<00:02:08.280> valves<00:02:08.670> and<00:02:08.789> you're<00:02:08.970> right<00:02:09.149> back

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
open up the valves and you're right back

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.330 
open up the valves and you're right back
where<00:02:09.420> you<00:02:09.660> started<00:02:09.780> that<00:02:10.349> is<00:02:10.619> a<00:02:10.679> pretty<00:02:11.069> cool

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
where you started that is a pretty cool

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.700 
where you started that is a pretty cool
deal<00:02:11.610> now<00:02:12.120> older<00:02:12.510> vehicles<00:02:12.989> like<00:02:13.200> this

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
deal now older vehicles like this

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.680 
deal now older vehicles like this
running<00:02:14.010> what's<00:02:14.160> known<00:02:14.340> as<00:02:14.490> r12<00:02:15.060> pretty<00:02:15.570> much

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
running what's known as r12 pretty much

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.060 
running what's known as r12 pretty much
all<00:02:15.900> the<00:02:16.020> newer<00:02:16.170> vehicles<00:02:16.590> right<00:02:16.740> now<00:02:16.920> I've

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.070 
all the newer vehicles right now I've

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:19.610 
all the newer vehicles right now I've
gone<00:02:17.220> to<00:02:17.370> r134a<00:02:18.270> as<00:02:18.570> far<00:02:18.780> as<00:02:18.870> coolant<00:02:19.260> goes<00:02:19.410> now

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
gone to r134a as far as coolant goes now

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.280 
gone to r134a as far as coolant goes now
what<00:02:19.770> that<00:02:19.800> is<00:02:19.950> is<00:02:20.130> your<00:02:20.730> r134a<00:02:21.600> is<00:02:21.960> a<00:02:21.990> little

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
what that is is your r134a is a little

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:23.930 
what that is is your r134a is a little
bit<00:02:22.410> more<00:02:22.530> environmentally<00:02:23.400> friendly

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
bit more environmentally friendly

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.480 
bit more environmentally friendly
so<00:02:24.180> everybody's<00:02:24.960> liking<00:02:25.410> that<00:02:25.560> now<00:02:25.830> let's<00:02:26.310> say

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:26.490 
so everybody's liking that now let's say

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:29.030 
so everybody's liking that now let's say
you're<00:02:26.670> gonna<00:02:26.880> actually<00:02:27.450> refill<00:02:28.380> your<00:02:28.560> system

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
you're gonna actually refill your system

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.010 
you're gonna actually refill your system
you're<00:02:29.190> gonna<00:02:29.280> recharge<00:02:29.880> it<00:02:30.180> now<00:02:30.330> the<00:02:30.750> sticker

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
you're gonna recharge it now the sticker

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:32.450 
you're gonna recharge it now the sticker
on<00:02:31.140> the<00:02:31.260> truck<00:02:31.590> says<00:02:31.860> fill<00:02:32.100> it<00:02:32.190> with<00:02:32.310> two

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:32.460 
on the truck says fill it with two

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:34.490 
on the truck says fill it with two
pounds<00:02:32.820> of<00:02:32.850> r12<00:02:33.360> but<00:02:33.960> you've<00:02:34.200> made<00:02:34.380> the

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
pounds of r12 but you've made the

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.860 
pounds of r12 but you've made the
conversion<00:02:34.710> and<00:02:35.310> you've<00:02:35.610> gone<00:02:35.790> to<00:02:35.970> 134a<00:02:36.720> so

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
conversion and you've gone to 134a so

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.170 
conversion and you've gone to 134a so
how<00:02:37.290> much<00:02:37.470> do<00:02:37.650> you<00:02:37.740> put<00:02:37.950> in<00:02:38.100> well<00:02:38.550> it<00:02:38.820> calls<00:02:39.090> for

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
how much do you put in well it calls for

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.780 
how much do you put in well it calls for
two<00:02:39.330> pounds<00:02:39.660> of<00:02:39.930> r12<00:02:40.410> and<00:02:40.590> a<00:02:40.890> good<00:02:41.100> idea<00:02:41.610> is

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
two pounds of r12 and a good idea is

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.090 
two pounds of r12 and a good idea is
about<00:02:42.000> 80%<00:02:42.420> of<00:02:42.990> whenever<00:02:43.650> you<00:02:43.770> would<00:02:43.830> put<00:02:44.010> in

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
about 80% of whenever you would put in

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.820 
about 80% of whenever you would put in
for<00:02:44.130> r12<00:02:44.760> that's<00:02:45.300> what<00:02:45.480> you<00:02:45.570> put<00:02:45.690> in<00:02:45.810> for<00:02:45.930> r134a

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
for r12 that's what you put in for r134a

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.310 
for r12 that's what you put in for r134a
so<00:02:46.950> you<00:02:47.130> put<00:02:47.280> in<00:02:47.370> about<00:02:47.460> 1.6<00:02:48.360> pounds<00:02:48.900> now<00:02:49.260> you

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
so you put in about 1.6 pounds now you

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.110 
so you put in about 1.6 pounds now you
had<00:02:49.530> this<00:02:49.710> little<00:02:49.980> this<00:02:50.370> little<00:02:50.430> site<00:02:50.880> right

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
had this little this little site right

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.610 
had this little this little site right
there<00:02:51.360> you<00:02:51.600> could<00:02:51.750> actually<00:02:51.930> see<00:02:52.380> when<00:02:52.560> you

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
there you could actually see when you

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:53.870 
there you could actually see when you
were<00:02:52.710> filling<00:02:52.920> it<00:02:53.100> up<00:02:53.160> back<00:02:53.370> in<00:02:53.520> the<00:02:53.550> day<00:02:53.610> with

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
were filling it up back in the day with

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.760 
were filling it up back in the day with
your<00:02:54.000> r12<00:02:54.480> you<00:02:54.870> could<00:02:55.050> watch<00:02:55.260> it<00:02:55.470> and<00:02:55.560> when<00:02:55.680> the

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:55.770 
your r12 you could watch it and when the

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:57.920 
your r12 you could watch it and when the
bubbles<00:02:56.070> ran<00:02:56.280> out<00:02:56.520> you<00:02:56.880> knew<00:02:57.000> it<00:02:57.120> was<00:02:57.270> full<00:02:57.510> but

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
bubbles ran out you knew it was full but

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.410 
bubbles ran out you knew it was full but
the<00:02:58.050> r134a<00:02:58.860> you<00:02:59.340> don't<00:02:59.490> have<00:02:59.670> that<00:02:59.910> luxury<00:03:00.120> you

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
the r134a you don't have that luxury you

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.210 
the r134a you don't have that luxury you
kind<00:03:00.600> of<00:03:00.660> have<00:03:00.840> to<00:03:00.870> guess<00:03:01.170> a<00:03:01.200> little<00:03:01.440> bit<00:03:01.590> maybe

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
kind of have to guess a little bit maybe

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.000 
kind of have to guess a little bit maybe
get<00:03:02.430> lucky<00:03:02.610> or<00:03:03.060> you<00:03:03.660> can<00:03:04.020> use<00:03:04.260> a<00:03:04.440> machine<00:03:04.830> like

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
get lucky or you can use a machine like

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:06.770 
get lucky or you can use a machine like
this<00:03:05.070> and<00:03:05.550> program<00:03:06.060> it<00:03:06.180> to<00:03:06.300> one<00:03:06.450> point<00:03:06.630> six

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
this and program it to one point six

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.270 
this and program it to one point six
pounds<00:03:07.320> and<00:03:07.380> that's<00:03:07.530> gonna<00:03:07.740> make<00:03:07.920> life<00:03:08.100> a<00:03:08.160> lot

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
pounds and that's gonna make life a lot

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.010 
pounds and that's gonna make life a lot
easier<00:03:08.340> now<00:03:09.000> this<00:03:09.210> machine's<00:03:09.540> a<00:03:09.660> little<00:03:09.900> bit

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:10.020 
easier now this machine's a little bit

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:11.870 
easier now this machine's a little bit
older<00:03:10.320> but<00:03:10.650> it's<00:03:10.800> got<00:03:10.950> both<00:03:11.250> of<00:03:11.280> them<00:03:11.490> offer<00:03:11.730> -

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
older but it's got both of them offer -

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.180 
older but it's got both of them offer -
you<00:03:12.000> are<00:03:12.180> 12<00:03:12.480> and<00:03:12.570> r134a<00:03:13.530> so<00:03:13.710> we'll<00:03:13.980> just<00:03:14.100> use

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
you are 12 and r134a so we'll just use

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:16.550 
you are 12 and r134a so we'll just use
the<00:03:14.370> 134a<00:03:15.000> we'll<00:03:15.240> plug<00:03:15.630> in<00:03:15.840> our<00:03:15.930> high<00:03:16.170> and<00:03:16.440> our

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
the 134a we'll plug in our high and our

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.500 
the 134a we'll plug in our high and our
low<00:03:16.740> side<00:03:17.070> to<00:03:17.520> our<00:03:17.550> cooling<00:03:17.940> system<00:03:18.330> and<00:03:18.390> we'll

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
low side to our cooling system and we'll

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.140 
low side to our cooling system and we'll
let<00:03:18.630> this<00:03:18.810> thing<00:03:19.050> do<00:03:19.230> its<00:03:19.440> work<00:03:19.710> right<00:03:20.190> now<00:03:20.790> we

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
let this thing do its work right now we

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:22.220 
let this thing do its work right now we
need<00:03:21.240> to<00:03:21.300> take<00:03:21.450> a<00:03:21.510> break<00:03:21.750> because<00:03:21.810> that<00:03:22.050> takes

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
need to take a break because that takes

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:23.360 
need to take a break because that takes
a<00:03:22.350> little<00:03:22.470> bit<00:03:22.590> of<00:03:22.650> time<00:03:22.860> but<00:03:22.980> when<00:03:23.100> we<00:03:23.220> come

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
a little bit of time but when we come

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.100 
a little bit of time but when we come
back<00:03:23.520> we'll<00:03:24.000> take<00:03:24.090> a<00:03:24.150> closer<00:03:24.420> look<00:03:24.540> at<00:03:24.870> how<00:03:25.080> it

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.110 
back we'll take a closer look at how it

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:28.040 
back we'll take a closer look at how it
all<00:03:25.320> does<00:03:25.800> its<00:03:25.980> thing
