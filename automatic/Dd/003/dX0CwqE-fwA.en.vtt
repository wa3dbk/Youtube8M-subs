00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:05.960 
you about some extensions that is a
review<00:00:04.529> on<00:00:04.650> quite<00:00:04.890> a<00:00:05.040> while<00:00:05.279> ago<00:00:05.310> they<00:00:05.940> were

review on quite a while ago they were
the<00:00:06.120> micro<00:00:06.480> bead<00:00:06.750> extensions<00:00:07.410> I'm<00:00:07.710> kind<00:00:08.010> of

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
the micro bead extensions I'm kind of

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:09.290 
the micro bead extensions I'm kind of
change<00:00:08.220> it<00:00:08.340> up<00:00:08.429> a<00:00:08.490> little<00:00:08.519> bit<00:00:08.820> and<00:00:08.940> we'll<00:00:09.150> talk

about<00:00:09.480> the<00:00:09.660> I<00:00:09.690> tip<00:00:10.080> extensions<00:00:10.679> see<00:00:11.309> I<00:00:11.340> views

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
about the I tip extensions see I views

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.580 
about the I tip extensions see I views
and<00:00:11.910> microbes<00:00:12.300> and<00:00:12.450> I<00:00:12.599> tips<00:00:12.900> quite<00:00:13.230> a<00:00:13.259> while

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
and microbes and I tips quite a while

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.950 
and microbes and I tips quite a while
now<00:00:13.620> and<00:00:14.099> I<00:00:14.250> know<00:00:14.400> what's<00:00:14.639> kind<00:00:14.969> of<00:00:15.059> battle<00:00:15.480> was

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
now and I know what's kind of battle was

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.370 
now and I know what's kind of battle was
not<00:00:16.199> as<00:00:16.320> good<00:00:16.410> and<00:00:16.910> the<00:00:17.910> quality<00:00:18.150> wet<00:00:19.050> by<00:00:19.320> the

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
not as good and the quality wet by the

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.269 
not as good and the quality wet by the
firmware<00:00:19.980> not<00:00:20.130> by<00:00:20.340> LeBron<00:00:20.900> etc<00:00:22.100> preferably<00:00:23.100> I

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
firmware not by LeBron etc preferably I

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.429 
firmware not by LeBron etc preferably I
do<00:00:23.400> like<00:00:23.820> the<00:00:23.850> out<00:00:24.090> of<00:00:24.300> extensions<00:00:24.930> instead<00:00:25.350> of

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
do like the out of extensions instead of

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.500 
do like the out of extensions instead of
the<00:00:25.529> micro<00:00:25.859> loops<00:00:26.099> so<00:00:26.699> if<00:00:27.000> you<00:00:27.090> write<00:00:27.240> creole

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
the micro loops so if you write creole

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.269 
the micro loops so if you write creole
oops<00:00:27.779> I<00:00:28.050> found<00:00:28.410> had<00:00:28.740> a<00:00:28.980> lot<00:00:29.220> of<00:00:30.619> deaths<00:00:31.619> in<00:00:32.040> it

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
oops I found had a lot of deaths in it

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:33.950 
oops I found had a lot of deaths in it
like<00:00:32.489> you<00:00:32.669> could<00:00:32.940> the<00:00:33.180> beads<00:00:33.390> obviously<00:00:33.809> too

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
like you could the beads obviously too

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.280 
like you could the beads obviously too
small<00:00:34.320> for<00:00:34.680> the<00:00:34.739> hair<00:00:35.010> or<00:00:35.340> the<00:00:36.000> loop<00:00:36.600> etc<00:00:37.230> and

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
small for the hair or the loop etc and

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:38.270 
small for the hair or the loop etc and
you<00:00:37.380> couldn't<00:00:37.590> use<00:00:37.739> them<00:00:37.860> so<00:00:38.010> we're<00:00:38.129> throwing

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
you couldn't use them so we're throwing

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.830 
you couldn't use them so we're throwing
away<00:00:38.520> half<00:00:38.700> the<00:00:38.730> hair<00:00:39.030> because<00:00:39.270> you<00:00:39.360> can<00:00:39.510> we

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
away half the hair because you can we

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.220 
away half the hair because you can we
use<00:00:40.050> the<00:00:40.230> hair<00:00:40.410> after<00:00:40.800> the<00:00:41.010> loops<00:00:41.730> pull<00:00:42.149> out<00:00:42.450> so

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
use the hair after the loops pull out so

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.540 
use the hair after the loops pull out so
that<00:00:43.379> was<00:00:43.469> a<00:00:43.530> huge<00:00:43.559> losses<00:00:44.010> came<00:00:44.340> out<00:00:44.460> my

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
that was a huge losses came out my

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.310 
that was a huge losses came out my
window<00:00:44.850> I<00:00:44.879> was<00:00:45.000> like<00:00:45.149> oh<00:00:45.270> yes<00:00:45.809> he<00:00:45.960> can't<00:00:46.140> even

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
window I was like oh yes he can't even

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.690 
window I was like oh yes he can't even
use<00:00:46.379> half<00:00:46.620> the<00:00:46.649> hell<00:00:46.920> you<00:00:47.039> end<00:00:47.250> up<00:00:47.370> throwing<00:00:47.489> it

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
use half the hell you end up throwing it

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.330 
use half the hell you end up throwing it
out<00:00:47.760> so<00:00:48.120> I've<00:00:48.480> decided<00:00:48.750> to<00:00:49.200> switch<00:00:49.710> to<00:00:49.920> item

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
out so I've decided to switch to item

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.000 
out so I've decided to switch to item
extensions<00:00:50.879> now<00:00:51.629> they<00:00:51.809> look<00:00:52.050> and<00:00:52.410> something

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
extensions now they look and something

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.770 
extensions now they look and something
like<00:00:53.280> this<00:00:53.430> obviously<00:00:54.000> don't<00:00:54.149> come<00:00:54.420> in<00:00:54.510> a<00:00:54.570> flat

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
like this obviously don't come in a flat

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.319 
like this obviously don't come in a flat
that's<00:00:55.140> just<00:00:55.350> what<00:00:55.590> I've<00:00:55.820> done<00:00:56.820> to<00:00:56.879> keep<00:00:57.149> them

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
that's just what I've done to keep them

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.479 
that's just what I've done to keep them
neat<00:00:57.539> and<00:00:57.930> not<00:00:58.350> getting<00:00:58.590> tangled<00:00:58.980> with<00:00:59.370> the

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
neat and not getting tangled with the

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.099 
neat and not getting tangled with the
rest<00:00:59.670> of<00:00:59.850> the<00:01:00.000> examples<00:01:00.449> I've<00:01:00.600> got<00:01:00.719> like<00:01:00.840> a<00:01:00.870> big

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
rest of the examples I've got like a big

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.969 
rest of the examples I've got like a big
extension<00:01:01.530> drawer<00:01:02.719> which<00:01:03.719> one<00:01:03.989> it's<00:01:04.680> very

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
extension drawer which one it's very

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.840 
extension drawer which one it's very
messy<00:01:05.129> yeah<00:01:05.580> so<00:01:06.420> this<00:01:07.380> is<00:01:07.500> one<00:01:07.740> individual<00:01:08.670> I

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
messy yeah so this is one individual I

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.090 
messy yeah so this is one individual I
tip<00:01:09.090> obviously<00:01:09.659> it's<00:01:09.780> just<00:01:10.080> actually<00:01:10.409> a<00:01:10.590> stick

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
tip obviously it's just actually a stick

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.560 
tip obviously it's just actually a stick
sometimes<00:01:11.549> they'll<00:01:11.700> call<00:01:11.939> stick<00:01:12.150> tip<00:01:12.360> thought

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
sometimes they'll call stick tip thought

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.760 
sometimes they'll call stick tip thought
I<00:01:12.720> tips<00:01:13.020> so<00:01:13.830> like<00:01:14.010> that<00:01:14.369> um<00:01:15.380> and<00:01:16.380> what<00:01:16.470> you<00:01:16.590> do

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
I tips so like that um and what you do

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:22.490 
I tips so like that um and what you do
is<00:01:17.479> you<00:01:18.479> put<00:01:20.570> so<00:01:21.570> you<00:01:21.630> could<00:01:21.840> get<00:01:21.990> a<00:01:22.049> pulling

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
is you put so you could get a pulling

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.749 
is you put so you could get a pulling
tool<00:01:23.009> or<00:01:23.759> a<00:01:23.820> threading<00:01:24.780> tool<00:01:25.049> or<00:01:25.409> I<00:01:25.830> don't<00:01:26.700> know

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
tool or a threading tool or I don't know

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.340 
tool or a threading tool or I don't know
the<00:01:26.880> technical<00:01:26.970> Thomas<00:01:27.540> but<00:01:27.780> because<00:01:28.049> i<00:01:28.080> have

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
the technical Thomas but because i have

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.800 
the technical Thomas but because i have
used<00:01:28.560> my<00:01:28.740> groups<00:01:29.040> before<00:01:29.369> and<00:01:29.970> maybe<00:01:30.509> people

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
used my groups before and maybe people

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.450 
used my groups before and maybe people
have<00:01:31.140> used<00:01:31.350> micra<00:01:31.710> loops<00:01:31.890> and<00:01:32.100> now<00:01:32.189> want<00:01:32.400> to

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
have used micra loops and now want to

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.160 
have used micra loops and now want to
switch<00:01:32.640> them<00:01:32.850> over<00:01:32.939> the<00:01:33.150> I<00:01:33.180> tips<00:01:33.540> and<00:01:33.750> a<00:01:33.990> bit

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
switch them over the I tips and a bit

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.010 
switch them over the I tips and a bit
more<00:01:34.320> and<00:01:34.590> if<00:01:35.280> you<00:01:35.400> if<00:01:35.700> you<00:01:35.820> catch<00:01:36.119> your<00:01:36.570> loops

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
more and if you if you catch your loops

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.469 
more and if you if you catch your loops
that<00:01:37.380> came<00:01:37.650> with<00:01:37.890> your<00:01:38.009> micro<00:01:38.369> loops<00:01:38.610> these

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
that came with your micro loops these

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.310 
that came with your micro loops these
are<00:01:39.930> godsend<00:01:40.619> and<00:01:41.240> so<00:01:42.240> you<00:01:42.329> can<00:01:42.570> put<00:01:42.810> your

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
are godsend and so you can put your

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.940 
are godsend and so you can put your
beads<00:01:43.740> it's<00:01:44.100> just<00:01:44.369> off<00:01:45.119> white<00:01:45.540> beans<00:01:46.320> as<00:01:46.619> an

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
beads it's just off white beans as an

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.270 
beads it's just off white beans as an
example<00:01:47.399> I<00:01:47.880> do<00:01:48.780> have<00:01:48.990> brown<00:01:49.500> somewhere<00:01:50.159> back

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
example I do have brown somewhere back

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.730 
example I do have brown somewhere back
up<00:01:50.460> finding<00:01:50.729> size<00:01:50.970> found<00:01:51.270> here<00:01:52.170> so<00:01:52.500> you<00:01:52.560> just

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
up finding size found here so you just

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.920 
up finding size found here so you just
put<00:01:52.829> all<00:01:53.009> your<00:01:53.280> look<00:01:53.490> at<00:01:53.640> your<00:01:53.850> beads<00:01:54.270> onto<00:01:54.689> the

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
put all your look at your beads onto the

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:55.870 
put all your look at your beads onto the
loop

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:55.880 
loop

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.560 
loop
like<00:01:56.659> that<00:01:57.020> and<00:01:57.500> then<00:01:58.430> you<00:01:58.579> just<00:01:58.700> read<00:01:59.000> your

00:01:59.560 --> 00:01:59.570 
like that and then you just read your

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:04.179 
like that and then you just read your
bead<00:01:59.780> on<00:02:00.280> to<00:02:01.280> the<00:02:01.399> hair<00:02:01.899> one<00:02:02.899> by<00:02:03.110> one<00:02:03.380> and<00:02:04.009> it's

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:04.189 
bead on to the hair one by one and it's

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:07.179 
bead on to the hair one by one and it's
really<00:02:04.430> easy<00:02:04.579> and<00:02:05.060> unique<00:02:05.689> and<00:02:05.930> if<00:02:06.590> you<00:02:06.950> have

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:07.189 
really easy and unique and if you have

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:09.130 
really easy and unique and if you have
someone<00:02:07.520> basically<00:02:07.850> next<00:02:08.630> to<00:02:08.690> you<00:02:08.780> which<00:02:08.929> I

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
someone basically next to you which I

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:10.389 
someone basically next to you which I
found<00:02:09.319> helpful<00:02:09.560> I've<00:02:09.800> got<00:02:09.920> my<00:02:10.039> little<00:02:10.160> brother

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:10.399 
found helpful I've got my little brother

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:13.030 
found helpful I've got my little brother
to<00:02:10.670> basically<00:02:11.150> every<00:02:11.750> time<00:02:12.590> I<00:02:12.620> got<00:02:12.830> halfway

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
to basically every time I got halfway

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.680 
to basically every time I got halfway
down<00:02:13.340> the<00:02:13.400> loop<00:02:13.640> and<00:02:13.910> I<00:02:13.970> saw<00:02:14.150> is<00:02:14.300> getting<00:02:14.510> shot

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
down the loop and I saw is getting shot

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:16.930 
down the loop and I saw is getting shot
and<00:02:14.780> beads<00:02:14.959> and<00:02:15.110> ask<00:02:15.380> him<00:02:15.590> to<00:02:15.790> Phillip<00:02:16.790> you

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
and beads and ask him to Phillip you

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.470 
and beads and ask him to Phillip you
know<00:02:17.060> three<00:02:17.480> or<00:02:17.510> four<00:02:18.019> row<00:02:18.709> and<00:02:19.040> loops<00:02:20.000> full<00:02:20.390> of

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
know three or four row and loops full of

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.720 
know three or four row and loops full of
beads<00:02:20.690> I<00:02:20.989> can<00:02:21.470> whack<00:02:21.739> them<00:02:21.890> in<00:02:22.010> really<00:02:22.519> quick

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
beads I can whack them in really quick

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:24.940 
beads I can whack them in really quick
and<00:02:22.880> obviously<00:02:23.180> and<00:02:23.530> so<00:02:24.530> once<00:02:24.680> you've<00:02:24.800> got<00:02:24.890> the

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
and obviously and so once you've got the

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:26.559 
and obviously and so once you've got the
bead<00:02:25.099> on<00:02:25.310> about<00:02:25.849> go<00:02:25.970> through<00:02:26.120> the<00:02:26.180> process<00:02:26.330> why

00:02:26.559 --> 00:02:26.569 
bead on about go through the process why

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:30.100 
bead on about go through the process why
don't<00:02:26.720> you<00:02:26.780> get<00:02:26.870> the<00:02:26.900> bead<00:02:27.110> on<00:02:27.319> the<00:02:27.380> hair<00:02:29.110> you

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
don't you get the bead on the hair you

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:33.520 
don't you get the bead on the hair you
know<00:02:30.230> got<00:02:30.380> a<00:02:30.410> strange<00:02:30.709> got<00:02:30.920> beed<00:02:31.190> so<00:02:31.880> here<00:02:32.530> and

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 
know got a strange got beed so here and

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:37.030 
know got a strange got beed so here and
you<00:02:33.799> just<00:02:33.950> get<00:02:34.220> the<00:02:34.549> tip<00:02:35.060> you<00:02:35.720> pull<00:02:36.080> it<00:02:36.260> into

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
you just get the tip you pull it into

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.740 
you just get the tip you pull it into
the<00:02:37.489> bead<00:02:37.670> and<00:02:38.000> get<00:02:38.690> your<00:02:38.870> apply<00:02:39.260> it<00:02:40.060> and<00:02:41.060> you

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
the bead and get your apply it and you

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:45.520 
the bead and get your apply it and you
just<00:02:41.930> clamp<00:02:42.440> it<00:02:42.620> shut<00:02:43.420> and<00:02:44.420> then<00:02:44.810> also<00:02:45.140> just<00:02:45.319> to

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
just clamp it shut and then also just to

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:47.500 
just clamp it shut and then also just to
get<00:02:45.680> them<00:02:45.799> out<00:02:45.890> you<00:02:46.069> just<00:02:46.250> do<00:02:46.370> the<00:02:46.700> reverse<00:02:47.060> you

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
get them out you just do the reverse you

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:48.819 
get them out you just do the reverse you
know<00:02:47.630> squeeze<00:02:47.930> it<00:02:48.049> get<00:02:48.140> away<00:02:48.290> so<00:02:48.349> it's<00:02:48.590> back<00:02:48.709> in

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:48.829 
know squeeze it get away so it's back in

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:51.759 
know squeeze it get away so it's back in
the<00:02:48.860> circle<00:02:49.099> hey<00:02:49.940> bozo<00:02:50.329> a<00:02:50.360> slip<00:02:50.840> back<00:02:51.049> out<00:02:51.200> so

00:02:51.759 --> 00:02:51.769 
the circle hey bozo a slip back out so

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:53.620 
the circle hey bozo a slip back out so
and<00:02:52.190> these<00:02:52.430> particular<00:02:52.730> ones<00:02:52.880> anyway<00:02:53.480> these

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:53.630 
and these particular ones anyway these

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:56.289 
and these particular ones anyway these
extensions<00:02:53.989> um<00:02:54.440> I<00:02:55.310> think<00:02:55.400> they<00:02:55.849> were<00:02:55.910> around

00:02:56.289 --> 00:02:56.299 
extensions um I think they were around

00:02:56.299 --> 00:02:59.319 
extensions um I think they were around
40<00:02:56.840> something<00:02:57.260> pounds<00:02:57.799> and<00:02:57.980> I<00:02:58.940> bought<00:02:59.209> them

00:02:59.319 --> 00:02:59.329 
40 something pounds and I bought them

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:05.590 
40 something pounds and I bought them
from<00:02:59.450> UK<00:02:59.959> I<00:03:00.280> bought<00:03:01.280> 200<00:03:02.230> I<00:03:03.230> think<00:03:03.590> and<00:03:04.130> and<00:03:05.060> it

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:05.600 
from UK I bought 200 I think and and it

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.210 
from UK I bought 200 I think and and it
was<00:03:05.690> enough<00:03:05.900> what<00:03:06.380> i<00:03:06.410> did<00:03:06.650> on<00:03:06.680> some<00:03:07.040> of<00:03:07.130> them

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220 
was enough what i did on some of them

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.509 
was enough what i did on some of them
though<00:03:07.340> because<00:03:07.579> I've<00:03:08.060> got<00:03:08.480> quite<00:03:08.690> a<00:03:08.810> small

00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:09.519 
though because I've got quite a small

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:13.569 
though because I've got quite a small
head<00:03:10.519> for<00:03:10.819> her<00:03:11.030> I<00:03:11.329> am<00:03:11.980> doubled<00:03:12.980> them<00:03:13.100> up<00:03:13.160> like<00:03:13.430> I

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:13.579 
head for her I am doubled them up like I

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:16.720 
head for her I am doubled them up like I
used<00:03:13.760> to<00:03:13.880> put<00:03:14.060> a<00:03:14.590> bead<00:03:15.590> on<00:03:15.980> one<00:03:16.280> of<00:03:16.400> the<00:03:16.459> hairs

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.730 
used to put a bead on one of the hairs

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:19.360 
used to put a bead on one of the hairs
and<00:03:17.209> then<00:03:17.510> put<00:03:17.810> another<00:03:18.079> micra<00:03:18.799> leap<00:03:18.920> into<00:03:19.160> the

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370 
and then put another micra leap into the

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:21.030 
and then put another micra leap into the
lead<00:03:19.519> clamp<00:03:19.850> it<00:03:19.970> shut<00:03:20.000> something<00:03:20.359> you'd<00:03:20.540> have

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 
lead clamp it shut something you'd have

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.470 
lead clamp it shut something you'd have
double<00:03:22.040> the<00:03:22.069> quantity<00:03:22.310> of<00:03:22.700> hair<00:03:22.970> in<00:03:23.209> one

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:23.480 
double the quantity of hair in one

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.240 
double the quantity of hair in one
strand<00:03:23.989> and<00:03:24.260> then<00:03:24.380> I<00:03:24.470> could<00:03:24.650> clip<00:03:24.889> it<00:03:25.010> into<00:03:25.100> my

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
strand and then I could clip it into my

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:27.430 
strand and then I could clip it into my
hat<00:03:25.430> or<00:03:25.639> company<00:03:26.180> into<00:03:26.329> my<00:03:26.389> hair<00:03:26.569> and<00:03:27.350> that's

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:27.440 
hat or company into my hair and that's

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:30.729 
hat or company into my hair and that's
double<00:03:27.859> the<00:03:27.889> thickness<00:03:28.540> and<00:03:29.540> nothing<00:03:30.049> a<00:03:30.380> tip

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:30.739 
double the thickness and nothing a tip

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:34.120 
double the thickness and nothing a tip
you<00:03:30.769> could<00:03:31.040> probably<00:03:31.900> use<00:03:32.900> for<00:03:33.590> the<00:03:33.709> beads<00:03:33.920> you

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.130 
you could probably use for the beads you

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:37.930 
you could probably use for the beads you
both<00:03:34.310> separately<00:03:34.850> to<00:03:35.239> the<00:03:35.359> hair<00:03:35.660> and<00:03:36.940> Mike's

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:37.940 
both separately to the hair and Mike's

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:40.360 
both separately to the hair and Mike's
can<00:03:38.180> get<00:03:38.389> pulling<00:03:38.660> tool<00:03:39.109> and<00:03:39.590> they're<00:03:40.040> all<00:03:40.130> i

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:40.370 
can get pulling tool and they're all i

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:43.569 
can get pulling tool and they're all i
got<00:03:40.579> these<00:03:40.730> white<00:03:41.180> I<00:03:42.040> don't<00:03:43.040> know<00:03:43.130> I've<00:03:43.400> got

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:43.579 
got these white I don't know I've got

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:46.449 
got these white I don't know I've got
the<00:03:43.639> brown<00:03:43.850> ones<00:03:44.120> as<00:03:44.239> well<00:03:44.269> I<00:03:45.220> have<00:03:46.220> them
