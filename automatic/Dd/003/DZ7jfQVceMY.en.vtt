here<00:02:34.600> this<00:02:35.110> is<00:02:35.290> way<00:02:35.500> better<00:02:35.680> than<00:02:35.829> putting

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
here this is way better than putting

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.039 
here this is way better than putting
your<00:02:36.370> hair<00:02:36.549> into<00:02:36.670> a<00:02:36.790> bun<00:02:37.030> and<00:02:37.209> then<00:02:37.450> pinning<00:02:37.750> on

00:02:38.039 --> 00:02:38.049 
your hair into a bun and then pinning on

your hair into a bun and then pinning on
the<00:02:38.230> blue<00:02:38.410> because<00:02:38.739> this<00:02:38.950> is<00:02:39.040> going<00:02:39.250> to<00:02:39.400> make

00:02:39.539 --> 00:02:39.549 
the blue because this is going to make

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:40.830 
the blue because this is going to make
sure<00:02:39.610> that<00:02:39.730> your<00:02:40.090> braid<00:02:40.269> doesn't<00:02:40.630> fall<00:02:40.810> off

throughout<00:02:41.260> the<00:02:41.470> day<00:02:41.650> now<00:02:42.160> just<00:02:42.640> continue

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
throughout the day now just continue

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:44.910 
throughout the day now just continue
your<00:02:43.269> braid<00:02:43.480> as<00:02:43.720> a<00:02:43.750> regular<00:02:44.109> braid<00:02:44.320> I'm<00:02:44.620> not

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
your braid as a regular braid I'm not

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.800 
your braid as a regular braid I'm not
really<00:02:45.190> pulling<00:02:45.609> onto<00:02:45.910> here<00:02:46.239> and<00:02:46.420> making<00:02:46.600> the

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
really pulling onto here and making the

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:48.780 
really pulling onto here and making the
break<00:02:46.989> type<00:02:47.260> I'm<00:02:47.709> writing<00:02:48.010> it<00:02:48.220> very<00:02:48.489> loosely

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
break type I'm writing it very loosely

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:50.670 
break type I'm writing it very loosely
because<00:02:49.150> like<00:02:49.480> I<00:02:49.630> said<00:02:49.690> before<00:02:49.959> I<00:02:50.200> want<00:02:50.530> it<00:02:50.650> to

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
because like I said before I want it to

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:54.660 
because like I said before I want it to
be<00:02:51.220> a<00:02:51.579> nice<00:02:52.000> jumbo<00:02:52.690> thick<00:02:53.470> braid<00:02:53.799> I<00:02:54.100> think<00:02:54.549> this

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
be a nice jumbo thick braid I think this

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:57.450 
be a nice jumbo thick braid I think this
year<00:02:54.910> will<00:02:55.150> look<00:02:55.390> better<00:02:55.600> with<00:02:55.840> the<00:02:55.959> bed

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:57.460 
year will look better with the bed

year will look better with the bed
