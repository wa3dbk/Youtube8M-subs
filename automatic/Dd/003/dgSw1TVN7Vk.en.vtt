00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.379
 Menshov 8 bones and we still have 

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:10.500
 four members 

00:00:06.379 --> 00:00:16.379
 peter oliver's on your athlete screens 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:19.820
 from Germany, by the way, I confess to him choreography 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:24.359
 also does lari nicole as she is 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:26.110
 I say that all 24 hours she may 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.870
 more 

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:31.210
 2 Grand Prix when he spoke with you 

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:33.450
 someone from the same and we were everywhere 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:33.450
 strong 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:55.810
 yes twisted quadruple but though not immediately 

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:55.810
 without even trying to leave 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:02.650
 until i'm very honest looting lose 

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:04.280
 there were no goods 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:07.750
 they asked for a varic fill 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.750
 but I do not see her work like that 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.080
 after 13 confident 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:51.640
 they themselves to look but speed loss 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:54.100
 speed during execution 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.780
 and landing almost in place but not 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.800
 planned cascade we initially 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:58.630
 understand here was supposed to be 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.940
 independent jump triple lutz but 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:02.860
 due to an error on the quad sheepskin cascade 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:04.780
 mixed in the second part of the program 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:07.920
 by the way on the plus anyway it's still on 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:07.920
 plus you plus 300 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:16.960
 then three was clearly the second exercise 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.960
 dates it is absolutely 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:11.890
 you are watching Oleg rotation in him 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.640
 mostly 4 levels but one final 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:16.480
 3 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:18.670
 so decide our technical commission here 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:21.880
 but on plus and of course it does not work only 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:24.370
 crash question nikol yes on the processor 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:26.320
 not just more skating they 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:29.580
 items because i didn't see 

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:29.580
 program don't drink me
