00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.900
 are 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:33.980
 hello and would have come to a new one 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:35.960
 video my name is duke and today goes 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:39.220
 it's about a video answer and that too 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:42.980
 unfiltered and her video yes war with 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:45.080
 toy guns i just want to 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:47.750
 say that the video so in advance 

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:50.239
 also to all fans or hangers or fun 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:51.830
 is first throw away so first 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:53.480
 really to all people before they die 

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:55.340
 Flames or whatever I want to give 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.650
 really explicit now i say 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:59.030
 I'm not a hero, I'm not one of them 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:00.380
 do not begrudge any one or his success 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:03.380
 total nonsense 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:04.940
 I only wish to address one thing 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:07.280
 personally in the video not in 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:09.410
 order were the video so as such 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.740
 was really great it was cool it has fun 

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:15.320
 really made to watch 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:17.330
 also in general I was mostly was very 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.920
 funny yes it was funny this format 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:22.490
 So I have really pissed 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:25.070
 celebrated yes but there was a thing that 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.180
 I did not think that was right because 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.880
 simply no goggles worn 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:30.319
 I think that should be considered as 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.420
 big youtuber and from a certain 

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:33.830
 reach if you sowas something synonymous 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.170
 also show a bit of responsibility 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:38.840
 and of course putting up green protection 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:40.690
 because the thing is I have that as me 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.220
 video I thought okay 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:44.990
 Just look at me and me 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:46.700
 I was waiting for this moment where 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.130
 maybe something to go to the eye 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.390
 and I was right I mean mine 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.759
 Of course you can say that at 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:55.759
 But adicash did not let us into it 

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:56.929
 face is logical but it can be too 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:02:00.140
 sometimes backfire can sometimes 

00:01:56.929 --> 00:02:01.520
 you also the flight this time 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.810
 geschoss not affect that 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.670
 that does not work either because of winter 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.830
 depending on how you bang or what that 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.630
 all at once the opposite makes you 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:11.360
 Do not know that and that's the thing 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:12.830
 that's just the thing and there is 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.000
 I want you a scene now 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.099
 already show at the beginning 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.390
 seen and how was that ok 

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:19.700
 I'm just that again 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:20.900
 yes but also want to say in advance 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.970
 before I show this scene like 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.650
 said, if you see I have it from 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:26.000
 browser added yes i have now 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.980
 not downloaded or so to say yes 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:32.780
 that's my or no no no 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:35.120
 said my own merit yes I say 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.349
 so that videos and so on 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.370
 unfiltered so as I said I would like 

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:39.049
 she too 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:40.519
 have no props or else like me 

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:43.670
 of course hope that the video anyway 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:46.250
 will have a long reach because it exists 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:48.620
 people or even spectators out there the 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:49.580
 imitate that because I think porcu 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.379
 I'm away from about 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:52.909
 or played and something 

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:54.260
 I also saw that and came 

00:02:52.909 --> 00:02:55.670
 yes, yes, yes, it was also clear 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.709
 but people who do not wear goggles 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:59.060
 then it is extremely shit and 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:00.319
 I will be many people now 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.730
 have already brought these weapons or 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:03.319
 also generally software or something else 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:04.790
 not on this track now 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:05.840
 have come and will not 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.340
 Wear safety glasses 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:09.260
 the people maybe now in too 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:10.609
 write the video under this 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.900
 video is the eighth you are 

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:13.760
 of course, stupid age first 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:16.790
 no, there are countless people 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.989
 videos on youtube where amateur player and 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:19.459
 play professionally and no 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:21.379
 Wear goggles what would I have 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:23.209
 softer times it is really nice says 

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:25.310
 he already from this plastic weapons this 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:26.900
 Shoot out yes that's the thing I do 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:28.190
 My honest I myself also play 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.810
 first of all, yes, I also have one 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:31.730
 recommendation 1 can sometimes bark 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:35.450
 little good video to be seen 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:36.920
 I rather have people quite honestly 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:39.079
 it just has to do it professionally and 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:41.840
 I also have a friend of myself 

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:44.180
 hat his eyesight lost yes 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.620
 a side by such an accident 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:47.419
 That's why I'm doing this video too 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:50.239
 today and I just want to do that 

00:03:47.419 --> 00:03:52.430
 People enlighten please people no matter what 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:54.139
 you also do outdoors or 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:56.299
 at home with your friends 

00:03:54.139 --> 00:03:58.310
 if you want to play something like that 

00:03:56.299 --> 00:03:59.660
 I ask you to buy one 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:01.010
 Protective film safety glasses is not expensive 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:02.510
 it may cost a tenth 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:03.079
 Amazon or something like that we will ever find 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:05.359
 after this 

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:06.650
 looks for soft goggles because 

00:04:05.359 --> 00:04:08.120
 Software goggles could then 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:10.340
 really use it for every game where 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:12.319
 maybe something in the soft parts go 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:13.970
 could and as you said if you yours 

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:16.340
 Eyesight does not matter on which one 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:19.070
 eye your quality of life is lost 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:20.900
 and that is I would say something right 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:23.330
 shit is and I hope that necessarily 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:25.490
 that video a bit played that 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:27.139
 he must see that, yes I hope 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:29.060
 that I'm addressing you here now 

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:30.500
 this video is what it is and 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:32.960
 maybe not a statement 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:34.460
 By the way , that really does that for you 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:35.870
 sometimes referenced or maybe 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:37.970
 simply just left purely 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:39.949
 Thursday bring your protection or that 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:42.289
 has this note is in the video with 

00:04:39.949 --> 00:04:45.050
 wearing goggles because quite honestly 

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:47.240
 it can go up and down so fast 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:49.130
 I can always do this scene again 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:50.740
 show again and again friends 

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:52.840
 it would also have been eye-catching 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:54.789
 that's just the thing as I said 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:56.229
 in itself that videos superstar no hero 

00:04:54.789 --> 00:04:58.330
 his or her thumb down 

00:04:56.229 --> 00:04:59.770
 is okay with me who but how 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:01.270
 I said it I want them 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:03.190
 set makes a great work I 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:04.630
 I'm super horny before her success 

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:05.860
 but i just stood this action 

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:06.580
 that no goggles have been worn 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:08.500
 to cool 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:10.090
 okay that 's it for me 

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:16.090
 Thank you subscribed for watching 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:21.069
 me and it friends and here to 

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:22.380
 video here is a real king art 

00:05:21.069 --> 00:05:28.210
 always 

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:31.659
 therefore always very close and yes as I said 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:33.250
 just play with goggles otherwise you can 

00:05:31.659 --> 00:05:37.780
 you actually forget it full 

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:41.909
 with and the rest actually results 

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:41.909
 easily seen by itself
