00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:16.480
 hello welcome to this beautiful hedjuk 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:19.300
 this is our third option of 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:21.700
 first communion hairstyle I separated the 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:23.980
 leftover hair with elastic after 

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:25.990
 have made a square and separate the 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:28.450
 Hair on the left and side 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:30.610
 right and this also stopped him here 

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:32.970
 with a clamp because we're going to start 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:32.970
 here 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:42.629
 let's start making some crepe 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:42.629
 towards the front 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:03.500
 If the hair is very thin you have to 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:03.500
 do it very very well 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:26.350
 and since we finished now we are going to 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:29.510
 place some hair spray 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:33.410
 you pick up where they started and to the center of 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:34.820
 away put some express that 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:38.090
 You can also put it to each 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:42.130
 step he makes in the the crepe that's going 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:42.130
 to help keep it more fluffy 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:06.650
 since we finish the crepe what we're going 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:09.259
 to do is with a brush like this we 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:13.000
 will help smooth back the 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:13.000
 hair without losing the crepe 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:23.180
 let's put all the hair together 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.180
 what we use for that 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:36.150
 and we are also going to place is in front 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:55.099
 since they finished elastic infusion in 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.230
 the back I let my hair down 

00:02:55.099 --> 00:03:00.470
 that had separated and we're going to start 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:03.129
 on the right side to take the piece 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:03.129
 that we had separated 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:18.180
 and here we are going to make a star of 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:18.180
 4 place hair spray 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:26.490
 then it's a thick end one thin and 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:28.830
 two thicknesses are sometimes going to start from 

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:30.780
 that have the left side up and 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:32.880
 down where they have the right side 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:34.640
 it's down 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:37.530
 and above 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:40.270
 again up 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:42.560
 and down 

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:44.930
 and then down 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:47.960
 and above if they have a hard time working 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:50.530
 use a little wax for the hair 

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:50.530
 og 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:59.299
 it's up 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:59.299
 down down up 

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:16.640
 what we are going to do when the 

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:20.360
 braid is to stretch the ends down and 

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:23.230
 those above we are going to pull as 

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:23.230
 we have done in other occasions 

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:50.610
 and now we are going to do the best that 

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:52.380
 we do in the sng break they will take the 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:55.290
 thin cape 

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:59.420
 the one who stayed at the center they take it and the 

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:59.420
 three others push them forward 

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:02.710
 and we settle 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:11.020
 me while they can place an elastic 

00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:11.020
 while tied with pins 

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:17.700
 here they stretch it well so that it 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:19.920
 glued 

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:23.210
 and we're going to fix it with a pin and 

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:23.210
 final we reinforce 

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:40.580
 we take here the middle end and 

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:43.490
 we stretch like in the sng break but of 

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:45.760
 four ends we now arrange towards 

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:45.760
 behind 

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:51.270
 we hold here with pins 

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:15.090
 put all the pins that create 

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:18.150
 convenient 

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:20.070
 what we are going to add are these flowers 

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:22.650
 great ones that have taught them how 

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:26.090
 put them on a pin we're going to 

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:26.090
 place in this way 

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:32.300
 you can put two or three 

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:44.900
 is here has already finished and has adorned 

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:44.900
 the hairstyle 

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:51.510
 in this way or if you prefer you can 

00:06:48.389 --> 00:06:55.000
 decorate also with small flowers 

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:58.020
 can they put along 

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.020
 of the hairstyle 

00:06:58.470 --> 00:07:04.580
 instead of the big ones 

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:04.580
 let's change 

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:13.420
 can be with with pure small and 

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:15.210
 small to the combined center or as more 

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:19.810
 you like it as best you want it 

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:22.390
 proceeds very nice very simple and fast 

00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:22.960
 to make them enjoy it and even the 

00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:25.650
 next 

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:25.650
 goodbye
