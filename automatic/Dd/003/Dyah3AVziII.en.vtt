so I originally went to Stanford Cancer

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:10.879 
so I originally went to Stanford Cancer
Center<00:00:09.870> after<00:00:10.019> I<00:00:10.200> was<00:00:10.380> diagnosed<00:00:10.500> with

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
Center after I was diagnosed with

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.230 
Center after I was diagnosed with
Hodgkin's<00:00:11.309> lymphoma<00:00:11.429> and<00:00:12.170> I<00:00:13.170> was<00:00:13.650> told<00:00:13.920> about

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:14.240 
Hodgkin's lymphoma and I was told about

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.180 
Hodgkin's lymphoma and I was told about
a<00:00:15.240> clinical<00:00:15.960> trial<00:00:16.230> that<00:00:16.410> I<00:00:16.470> might<00:00:16.770> qualify

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
a clinical trial that I might qualify

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.120 
a clinical trial that I might qualify
for<00:00:17.910> here<00:00:18.180> at<00:00:18.270> paccar<00:00:18.510> so<00:00:18.990> two<00:00:19.619> days<00:00:19.830> later

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
for here at paccar so two days later

for here at paccar so two days later
after<00:00:20.490> that<00:00:20.880> initial<00:00:21.330> appointment<00:00:21.960> at<00:00:22.380> the

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
after that initial appointment at the

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.620 
after that initial appointment at the
Cancer<00:00:22.949> Center<00:00:23.279> I<00:00:23.519> came<00:00:23.580> here<00:00:23.789> to<00:00:24.180> Packard

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
Cancer Center I came here to Packard

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.820 
Cancer Center I came here to Packard
where<00:00:25.320> I<00:00:25.350> met<00:00:25.560> dr.<00:00:25.710> link<00:00:26.130> and<00:00:26.490> I<00:00:27.029> was<00:00:27.570> just

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:27.830 
where I met dr. link and I was just

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:31.130 
where I met dr. link and I was just
amazed<00:00:28.830> by<00:00:29.160> him<00:00:29.400> so<00:00:29.820> Jennifer<00:00:30.539> came<00:00:30.810> to<00:00:30.960> us

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
amazed by him so Jennifer came to us

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.650 
amazed by him so Jennifer came to us
with<00:00:32.000> intermediate-risk<00:00:33.000> Hodgkin's<00:00:33.570> disease

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
with intermediate-risk Hodgkin's disease

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.830 
with intermediate-risk Hodgkin's disease
and<00:00:34.489> this<00:00:35.489> is<00:00:35.670> a<00:00:35.700> group<00:00:36.059> of<00:00:36.210> children<00:00:36.450> and

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
and this is a group of children and

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.020 
and this is a group of children and
young<00:00:36.899> adults<00:00:37.350> where<00:00:37.950> we're<00:00:38.190> quite<00:00:38.520> confident

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
young adults where we're quite confident

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.990 
young adults where we're quite confident
that<00:00:39.210> we<00:00:39.329> can<00:00:39.480> cure<00:00:39.780> them<00:00:39.989> but<00:00:40.890> we<00:00:41.489> are<00:00:41.879> very

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
that we can cure them but we are very

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.729 
that we can cure them but we are very
concerned<00:00:42.540> about<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:43.140> late<00:00:43.290> effects<00:00:43.649> of

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
concerned about the late effects of

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.590 
concerned about the late effects of
treatment<00:00:43.920> so<00:00:44.340> part<00:00:44.640> of<00:00:44.730> what<00:00:44.789> we<00:00:45.000> concentrate

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
treatment so part of what we concentrate

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.020 
treatment so part of what we concentrate
on<00:00:45.780> is<00:00:45.989> can<00:00:46.260> we<00:00:46.500> minimize<00:00:46.770> the<00:00:47.280> price<00:00:47.520> of<00:00:47.730> cure

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
on is can we minimize the price of cure

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.420 
on is can we minimize the price of cure
so<00:00:48.539> our<00:00:48.870> current<00:00:49.200> studies<00:00:49.559> are<00:00:49.770> aiming<00:00:50.070> to

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
so our current studies are aiming to

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.209 
so our current studies are aiming to
reduce<00:00:50.969> the<00:00:51.480> amount<00:00:52.079> of<00:00:52.289> radiation<00:00:52.620> we<00:00:53.010> give

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
reduce the amount of radiation we give

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:54.529 
reduce the amount of radiation we give
in<00:00:53.370> the<00:00:53.489> amount<00:00:53.670> of<00:00:53.910> her<00:00:54.120> that<00:00:54.329> gets

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
in the amount of her that gets

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.720 
in the amount of her that gets
irradiated<00:00:54.780> and<00:00:55.410> that<00:00:55.860> really<00:00:56.070> is<00:00:56.250> the<00:00:56.280> focus

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
irradiated and that really is the focus

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.270 
irradiated and that really is the focus
of<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:56.969> trial<00:00:57.270> for<00:00:57.390> which<00:00:57.660> he<00:00:57.899> was<00:00:58.559> eligible

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
of the trial for which he was eligible

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.279 
of the trial for which he was eligible
in<00:00:59.670> which<00:00:59.850> we<00:01:00.030> entered<00:01:00.210> on<00:01:00.510> her<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:00.989> care<00:01:01.260> I

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
in which we entered on her the care I

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.500 
in which we entered on her the care I
Lucile<00:01:01.890> Packard<00:01:01.949> is<00:01:02.460> better<00:01:02.699> than<00:01:02.969> any<00:01:03.270> other

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
Lucile Packard is better than any other

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.289 
Lucile Packard is better than any other
hospital<00:01:04.049> that<00:01:04.170> I've<00:01:04.290> ever<00:01:04.350> been<00:01:04.619> to<00:01:05.000> um<00:01:06.000> all

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
wonderful patient so it turns out that

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.800 
wonderful patient so it turns out that
she<00:01:15.960> had<00:01:15.990> a<00:01:16.170> number<00:01:16.590> of<00:01:17.000> problems<00:01:18.000> related<00:01:18.780> to

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
she had a number of problems related to

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.960 
she had a number of problems related to
her<00:01:19.080> diagnostic<00:01:19.950> workup<00:01:20.310> as<00:01:20.520> well<00:01:20.700> as<00:01:20.850> her

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
her diagnostic workup as well as her

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.149 
her diagnostic workup as well as her
therapy<00:01:21.450> which<00:01:21.659> we<00:01:21.780> don't<00:01:21.900> often<00:01:22.140> see<00:01:22.500> so

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
therapy which we don't often see so

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:24.890 
therapy which we don't often see so
first<00:01:23.430> of<00:01:23.549> all<00:01:23.640> she<00:01:23.880> came<00:01:24.090> in<00:01:24.330> and<00:01:24.450> she<00:01:24.509> had<00:01:24.780> an

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
first of all she came in and she had an

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.810 
first of all she came in and she had an
unusual<00:01:25.560> lesion<00:01:25.979> in<00:01:26.100> one<00:01:26.250> of<00:01:26.280> her<00:01:26.430> hip<00:01:26.580> bones

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
unusual lesion in one of her hip bones

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.780 
unusual lesion in one of her hip bones
which<00:01:27.210> we<00:01:27.390> didn't<00:01:27.689> really<00:01:27.990> think<00:01:28.340> was<00:01:29.340> related

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
which we didn't really think was related

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.670 
which we didn't really think was related
to<00:01:29.880> Hodgkin's<00:01:30.299> disease<00:01:30.329> but<00:01:31.110> we<00:01:31.259> couldn't<00:01:31.560> be

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
to Hodgkin's disease but we couldn't be

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.370 
to Hodgkin's disease but we couldn't be
certain<00:01:31.860> and<00:01:32.100> we<00:01:32.189> had<00:01:32.640> to<00:01:32.820> make<00:01:33.780> sure<00:01:34.049> that<00:01:34.290> it

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
certain and we had to make sure that it

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.840 
certain and we had to make sure that it
wasn't<00:01:34.619> Hodgkin's<00:01:35.159> disease<00:01:35.220> because<00:01:35.700> that

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
wasn't Hodgkin's disease because that

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.219 
wasn't Hodgkin's disease because that
would<00:01:35.970> have<00:01:36.000> required<00:01:36.210> more<00:01:36.720> intensive

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
would have required more intensive

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.260 
would have required more intensive
treatment<00:01:37.619> so<00:01:38.070> she<00:01:38.250> had<00:01:38.460> to<00:01:38.490> undergo<00:01:38.880> an

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
treatment so she had to undergo an

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.060 
treatment so she had to undergo an
additional<00:01:39.780> bone<00:01:40.020> biopsy<00:01:40.470> which<00:01:40.829> of<00:01:40.979> course

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
additional bone biopsy which of course

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.249 
additional bone biopsy which of course
was<00:01:41.430> uncomfortable<00:01:42.060> but<00:01:42.540> fortunately<00:01:43.049> we

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
was uncomfortable but fortunately we

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.710 
was uncomfortable but fortunately we
found<00:01:43.290> out<00:01:43.710> that<00:01:43.979> it<00:01:44.460> was<00:01:44.640> indeed<00:01:44.790> not<00:01:45.240> related

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
found out that it was indeed not related

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.270 
found out that it was indeed not related
to<00:01:45.840> her<00:01:45.960> Hodgkin's<00:01:46.380> disease<00:01:46.439> and<00:01:46.950> we<00:01:47.040> could

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
to her Hodgkin's disease and we could

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.190 
to her Hodgkin's disease and we could
treat<00:01:47.729> her<00:01:47.820> with<00:01:48.000> less<00:01:48.240> intensive<00:01:48.780> treatment

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
treat her with less intensive treatment

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.899 
treat her with less intensive treatment
you<00:01:49.560> know<00:01:49.680> there<00:01:49.829> is<00:01:49.979> one<00:01:50.159> there<00:01:50.640> is<00:01:50.670> one

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
you know there is one there is one

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.639 
you know there is one there is one
