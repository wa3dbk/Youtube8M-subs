00:00:04.609 --> 00:00:12.170
 It's with this episode shocked jobs but only 

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:12.170
 in October 

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:21.580
 jobson is crazy opened his mouth is when a 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:22.869
 man wants is the world's changed 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:25.599
 my friends today things happen 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:27.490
 unthinkable case study is a matter of 

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:29.919
 sound the question of the living dead since 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:31.720
 at a young age that I love movies 

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:34.030
 terror and Israel in particular films of the 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:37.090
 men there is a special mystique in the 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:39.250
 omb classic films are rather unhealthy 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:41.559
 involve people in composition who 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:43.570
 want to eat other people more than 

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:45.250
 example I adore is the inability 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:47.290
 men shrug their shoulders and that part 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:49.480
 the optimist in case you see an apocalypse 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:52.390
 zombie I always think I did not fall it 's 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:54.370
 too bad I'm curious should generate bad 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:54.879
 but it takes is total to win 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:56.620
 trophies 

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:58.300
 a person can perfectly end the 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:00.489
 lunch on a terrace followed a 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.980
 live in your connection to the 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:03.999
 street nor do you have to run your 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:05.680
 afraid home 

00:01:03.999 --> 00:01:08.810
 just walk slightly faster 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:10.820
 and they do not run stay on 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:12.530
 is a lament gossip follow your 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:14.299
 and picked up the next 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:16.100
 because one of the men in the 

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:20.329
 classic sense for more recently 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:22.039
 has movie name war becomes kites 

00:01:20.329 --> 00:01:24.920
 young people who dream and it was not a good 

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:28.680
 making a call seems like a betrayal 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:33.960
 the mystical young sound john biehl 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:35.850
 ottawa son is that the film is very 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:39.000
 famous in our area not be the rest of the 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:44.550
 living dead is not the clear moment which 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.479
 I do not I, I, I, I think all that one 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:48.150
 person has to do 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.979
 even if there is plague the men was 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:52.110
 looking around will not appear a 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:54.060
 behind the person but in the background what iran 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.650
 who is not content with zombies think 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.090
 and it is no different with care 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:58.560
 person trying to cross an outfit not 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.750
 will be popular will look to one side or 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.390
 on the other, no one will advance 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.160
 Good like I said I'd rather swim and I 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.500
 I think this does not contribute anything like 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:09.929
 abandoned everything was not were men 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.370
 I'm afraid today, the Saints Sunday. 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.620
 finding it strange to say that the 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.959
 great challenge even after reaching this 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.209
 point that this is amazing today the names 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:19.620
 it's crises is and I think it's time for 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:22.110
 My absence did not contribute to anything. 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.400
 to impress thousand tries to introduce the 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.260
 subject dead with several 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.480
 Mythologies they kept looking at me. 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.700
 like I 'm a zombie myself 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.410
 besides composing one of them for this phrase 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.700
 I'm still afraid that the 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.470
 time was considered sick of the head 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.330
 for a movie star men 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:38.810
 I'm also just a boy and some 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:41.489

 girl turns the living dead more dead 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:53.370

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.959
 and turns it 's like it does not 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.000
 happened when I was in school 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:59.280
 everything happens for when 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.950
 school wear glasses was against traffic 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:03.209

 house came face to face with the owner 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:47.819
 from 37 years old 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:50.310

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:54.180
 most talented the Jessica police say 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:56.099
 who did not want to rob the house memory 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:58.859

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:24.210
