00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:26.089 
the power pack and then it has this RCA
cable<00:00:22.830> here<00:00:23.640> so<00:00:23.970> I'm<00:00:24.029> gonna<00:00:24.180> spike<00:00:24.779> them<00:00:25.099> show

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
cable here so I'm gonna spike them show

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.099 
cable here so I'm gonna spike them show
you<00:00:26.189> how<00:00:26.340> to<00:00:26.400> hook<00:00:26.640> this<00:00:26.849> up<00:00:27.029> so<00:00:27.269> there's<00:00:27.960> the

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.260 
you're out that's the only thing that's
out<00:00:34.890> so<00:00:35.160> unless<00:00:35.340> you<00:00:35.489> have<00:00:35.579> the<00:00:35.700> RF<00:00:36.030> modulator

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
out so unless you have the RF modulator

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.100 
out so unless you have the RF modulator
and<00:00:36.780> so<00:00:37.350> I<00:00:37.380> went<00:00:37.620> to<00:00:38.090> RadioShack<00:00:39.090> and<00:00:39.540> I<00:00:39.870> picked

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
and so I went to RadioShack and I picked

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:45.920 
and so I went to RadioShack and I picked
up<00:00:40.489> this<00:00:41.489> it's<00:00:41.850> an<00:00:42.090> RCA<00:00:42.690> to<00:00:43.250> coax<00:00:44.250> adapter<00:00:45.030> so

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
up this it's an RCA to coax adapter so

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.910 
up this it's an RCA to coax adapter so
you<00:00:46.020> just<00:00:46.170> pull<00:00:46.920> again<00:00:47.370> into<00:00:47.610> there<00:00:48.829> then<00:00:49.829> you

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
you just pull again into there then you

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:56.029 
you just pull again into there then you
find<00:00:50.160> your<00:00:50.280> uh<00:00:50.340> normal<00:00:53.750> just<00:00:54.750> cable<00:00:55.320> cable

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
find your uh normal just cable cable

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.090 
find your uh normal just cable cable
plug<00:00:56.340> it<00:00:56.460> in<00:00:56.579> there<00:00:57.590> so<00:00:58.590> now<00:00:58.770> you<00:00:58.829> have<00:00:59.070> a

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
plug it in there so now you have a

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.360 
plug it in there so now you have a
connected<00:00:59.640> to<00:01:00.239> an<00:01:00.510> area<00:01:00.840> follow<00:01:01.739> that<00:01:01.949> cable

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
connected to an area follow that cable

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.039 
connected to an area follow that cable
all<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:02.760> way<00:01:02.820> around<00:01:03.090> to<00:01:03.359> this<00:01:03.480> end<00:01:03.719> and<00:01:03.930> it's

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
all the way around to this end and it's

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.450 
all the way around to this end and it's
just<00:01:04.229> a<00:01:04.350> cable<00:01:04.650> so<00:01:04.710> you<00:01:04.739> can<00:01:04.830> plug<00:01:04.920> that<00:01:05.189> to<00:01:05.369> the

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
just a cable so you can plug that to the

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.190 
just a cable so you can plug that to the
back<00:01:05.610> of<00:01:05.760> your<00:01:05.850> TV<00:01:06.240> for<00:01:06.510> your<00:01:06.689> antenna<00:01:06.990> would

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
back of your TV for your antenna would

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.830 
back of your TV for your antenna would
not<00:01:07.320> really<00:01:07.560> go<00:01:07.760> so<00:01:08.760> now<00:01:09.119> we're<00:01:09.270> gonna<00:01:09.360> see<00:01:09.659> if

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
not really go so now we're gonna see if

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.999 
not really go so now we're gonna see if
this<00:01:09.960> thing<00:01:10.200> can<00:01:10.229> work<00:01:11.689> so<00:01:13.640> here<00:01:14.640> is<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:15.180> TV

00:01:15.999 --> 00:01:16.009 
this thing can work so here is the TV

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:21.679 
this thing can work so here is the TV
it'll<00:01:17.009> plug<00:01:17.220> it<00:01:17.369> in<00:01:17.460> there<00:01:18.500> and<00:01:20.540> already<00:01:21.540> got

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
it'll plug it in there and already got

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.450 
it'll plug it in there and already got
the<00:01:21.840> TV<00:01:22.170> turned<00:01:22.409> on<00:01:22.530> and<00:01:22.890> these<00:01:23.159> are<00:01:23.340> my

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
the TV turned on and these are my

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.060 
the TV turned on and these are my
smaller<00:01:23.759> TV<00:01:24.240> so<00:01:24.420> we<00:01:24.509> can<00:01:24.540> get<00:01:25.409> a<00:01:25.470> hooked<00:01:25.680> up<00:01:25.860> so

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
smaller TV so we can get a hooked up so

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.590 
smaller TV so we can get a hooked up so
there's<00:01:26.520> the<00:01:26.700> TV<00:01:27.119> and<00:01:28.700> there's<00:01:29.700> the<00:01:30.060> on<00:01:30.180> switch

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
there's the TV and there's the on switch

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.370 
there's the TV and there's the on switch
flip<00:01:31.470> it<00:01:31.619> on<00:01:31.770> well<00:01:32.579> look<00:01:32.880> at<00:01:33.030> that<00:01:33.060> and<00:01:33.630> it

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
flip it on well look at that and it

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:42.710 
flip it on well look at that and it
works<00:01:35.990> perfect

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.660 

Oh<00:01:42.750> wha<00:01:43.650> the<00:01:43.830> problem<00:01:44.190> is<00:01:44.310> I<00:01:44.400> don't<00:01:44.460> have<00:01:44.550> a

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
Oh wha the problem is I don't have a

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.030 
Oh wha the problem is I don't have a
gamer<00:01:44.850> there<00:01:45.060> let's<00:01:45.840> see<00:01:46.500> if<00:01:46.560> it<00:01:46.650> works<00:01:46.800> with<00:01:47.010> a

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
gamer there let's see if it works with a

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:55.450 
gamer there let's see if it works with a
game<00:01:49.490> Donkey<00:01:50.490> Kong<00:01:52.850> look<00:01:53.850> at<00:01:53.970> that

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:55.460 
game Donkey Kong look at that

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:01.760 
game Donkey Kong look at that
Nintendo<00:01:56.750> Donkey<00:01:57.750> Kong<00:02:00.200> pull<00:02:01.200> the<00:02:01.350> controller
