bigger brain make you smarter well let's

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:16.700 
bigger brain make you smarter well let's
find<00:00:07.859> out

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.990 

for<00:00:17.710> a<00:00:17.740> start<00:00:18.040> I<00:00:18.190> just<00:00:18.220> want<00:00:18.580> to<00:00:18.640> say<00:00:18.760> that<00:00:18.910> the

for a start I just want to say that the

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.400 
for a start I just want to say that the
brain<00:00:19.180> is<00:00:19.330> the<00:00:19.420> most<00:00:19.480> amazing<00:00:20.020> thing<00:00:20.230> in<00:00:20.320> the

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:20.410 
brain is the most amazing thing in the

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:22.200 
brain is the most amazing thing in the
entire<00:00:20.500> universe<00:00:20.790> some<00:00:21.790> people<00:00:22.030> could<00:00:22.180> say

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:22.210 
entire universe some people could say

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:25.019 
entire universe some people could say
it's<00:00:22.630> the<00:00:22.720> ocean<00:00:22.900> the<00:00:23.440> Stars<00:00:23.740> the<00:00:24.189> animals<00:00:24.700> or

it's the ocean the Stars the animals or

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:26.820 
it's the ocean the Stars the animals or
even<00:00:25.090> your<00:00:25.480> grandma's<00:00:25.840> cooking<00:00:26.140> without

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:26.830 
even your grandma's cooking without

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:28.440 
even your grandma's cooking without
something<00:00:27.040> to<00:00:27.250> understand<00:00:27.970> how<00:00:28.210> valuable

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:28.450 
something to understand how valuable

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:30.570 
something to understand how valuable
those<00:00:29.020> things<00:00:29.320> are<00:00:29.619> but<00:00:30.130> that's<00:00:30.279> something

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:30.580 
those things are but that's something

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:32.159 
those things are but that's something
that<00:00:30.610> can<00:00:30.880> realize<00:00:31.390> that<00:00:31.420> those<00:00:31.780> things<00:00:31.930> are

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:32.169 
that can realize that those things are

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:34.229 
that can realize that those things are
amazing<00:00:32.349> are<00:00:32.830> they<00:00:33.100> truly<00:00:33.430> that<00:00:33.760> amazing

00:00:34.229 --> 00:00:34.239 
amazing are they truly that amazing

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:35.790 
amazing are they truly that amazing
because<00:00:34.629> the<00:00:34.900> only<00:00:35.050> thing<00:00:35.320> that<00:00:35.470> can<00:00:35.590> put

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:35.800 
because the only thing that can put

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.860 
because the only thing that can put
value<00:00:36.280> on<00:00:36.309> things<00:00:36.790> like<00:00:37.120> that

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:37.870 
value on things like that

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:40.110 
value on things like that
is<00:00:37.930> the<00:00:38.350> human<00:00:38.530> brain<00:00:38.860> and<00:00:39.280> that's<00:00:39.760> beyond

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:40.120 
is the human brain and that's beyond

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.390 
is the human brain and that's beyond
amazing<00:00:40.420> I<00:00:40.840> think<00:00:41.199> my<00:00:41.559> brain<00:00:41.800> for<00:00:42.070> helping<00:00:42.309> me

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:42.400 
amazing I think my brain for helping me

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.700 
amazing I think my brain for helping me
formulate<00:00:42.879> that<00:00:43.270> conclusion<00:00:43.900> so<00:00:44.410> does<00:00:44.680> that

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:44.710 
formulate that conclusion so does that

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.729 
formulate that conclusion so does that
make<00:00:44.949> me<00:00:45.160> smart<00:00:45.550> well<00:00:46.090> what<00:00:46.570> is<00:00:46.690> smart<00:00:47.110> at<00:00:47.530> the

00:00:47.729 --> 00:00:47.739 
make me smart well what is smart at the

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:49.380 
make me smart well what is smart at the
common<00:00:48.070> fallacy<00:00:48.580> to<00:00:48.610> believe<00:00:49.000> that<00:00:49.150> just

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:49.390 
common fallacy to believe that just

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:51.119 
common fallacy to believe that just
having<00:00:49.750> a<00:00:49.809> larger<00:00:50.110> brain<00:00:50.290> in<00:00:50.470> general<00:00:50.500> makes

00:00:51.119 --> 00:00:51.129 
having a larger brain in general makes

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:53.399 
having a larger brain in general makes
you<00:00:51.370> smarter<00:00:51.940> because<00:00:52.210> if<00:00:52.720> that<00:00:52.960> was<00:00:53.110> true

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:53.409 
you smarter because if that was true

00:00:53.409 --> 00:00:54.869 
you smarter because if that was true
humans<00:00:54.190> would<00:00:54.339> not<00:00:54.460> be<00:00:54.580> the<00:00:54.699> smartest

00:00:54.869 --> 00:00:54.879 
humans would not be the smartest

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:56.610 
humans would not be the smartest
organisms<00:00:55.600> on<00:00:55.750> earth<00:00:55.930> that<00:00:56.260> would<00:00:56.409> go<00:00:56.559> to

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:56.620 
organisms on earth that would go to

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:58.649 
organisms on earth that would go to
whales<00:00:56.890> and<00:00:57.430> more<00:00:57.640> specifically<00:00:58.150> the<00:00:58.360> sperm

00:00:58.649 --> 00:00:58.659 
whales and more specifically the sperm

00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:00.450 
whales and more specifically the sperm
whale<00:00:58.870> the<00:00:59.350> sperm<00:00:59.620> whale<00:00:59.800> has<00:00:59.830> a<00:01:00.010> brain<00:01:00.280> that's

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:00.460 
whale the sperm whale has a brain that's

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:02.640 
whale the sperm whale has a brain that's
only<00:01:00.729> 5<00:01:01.180> times<00:01:01.449> larger<00:01:01.690> than<00:01:01.960> that<00:01:02.049> of<00:01:02.110> humans

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:02.650 
only 5 times larger than that of humans

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:05.399 
only 5 times larger than that of humans
now<00:01:03.309> I<00:01:03.339> say<00:01:03.640> only<00:01:03.820> 5<00:01:04.180> times<00:01:04.510> larger<00:01:04.720> because<00:01:05.049> I

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:05.409 
now I say only 5 times larger because I

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:06.960 
now I say only 5 times larger because I
believe<00:01:05.650> that<00:01:05.830> is<00:01:06.010> impressive<00:01:06.280> on<00:01:06.549> our<00:01:06.670> part

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:06.970 
believe that is impressive on our part

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:09.300 
believe that is impressive on our part
being<00:01:07.420> that<00:01:07.510> sperm<00:01:08.020> whales<00:01:08.200> are<00:01:08.530> much<00:01:08.860> larger

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:09.310 
being that sperm whales are much larger

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:11.580 
being that sperm whales are much larger
than<00:01:09.430> just<00:01:09.490> 5<00:01:09.850> times<00:01:10.090> our<00:01:10.330> size<00:01:10.540> so<00:01:11.409> yeah

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:11.590 
than just 5 times our size so yeah

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:14.160 
than just 5 times our size so yeah
that's<00:01:11.770> one<00:01:11.979> for<00:01:12.220> humans<00:01:12.580> yay<00:01:13.299> but<00:01:13.990> also

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:14.170 
that's one for humans yay but also

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:16.140 
that's one for humans yay but also
elephants<00:01:14.920> and<00:01:15.040> dolphins<00:01:15.250> have<00:01:15.790> larger

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:16.150 
elephants and dolphins have larger

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:17.700 
elephants and dolphins have larger
brains<00:01:16.420> than<00:01:16.540> us<00:01:16.750> but<00:01:17.049> does<00:01:17.200> that<00:01:17.260> make<00:01:17.560> them

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:17.710 
brains than us but does that make them

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:20.250 
brains than us but does that make them
smarter<00:01:18.280> no<00:01:18.880> but<00:01:19.330> if<00:01:19.420> you<00:01:19.510> notice<00:01:19.840> those

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:20.260 
smarter no but if you notice those

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.470 
smarter no but if you notice those
animals<00:01:20.710> have<00:01:20.890> pretty<00:01:21.310> complex<00:01:21.850> ways<00:01:22.240> of

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:22.480 
animals have pretty complex ways of

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:25.080 
animals have pretty complex ways of
living<00:01:22.840> or<00:01:23.050> motor<00:01:23.590> skills<00:01:24.100> and<00:01:24.340> that's<00:01:24.700> what

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.090 
living or motor skills and that's what

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:26.640 
living or motor skills and that's what
their<00:01:25.330> brain<00:01:25.630> is<00:01:25.840> dedicated<00:01:26.470> to

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:26.650 
their brain is dedicated to

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:28.770 
their brain is dedicated to
understanding<00:01:26.920> and<00:01:27.520> processing<00:01:28.090> the<00:01:28.360> reason

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:28.780 
understanding and processing the reason

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:30.690 
understanding and processing the reason
why<00:01:28.900> the<00:01:28.960> sperm<00:01:29.470> whales<00:01:29.620> brain<00:01:29.920> is<00:01:30.070> so<00:01:30.220> big<00:01:30.460> is

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:30.700 
why the sperm whales brain is so big is

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.820 
why the sperm whales brain is so big is
because<00:01:30.880> it's<00:01:31.180> got<00:01:31.300> such<00:01:31.510> a<00:01:31.540> massive<00:01:32.170> body<00:01:32.470> it

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:32.830 
because it's got such a massive body it

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:34.290 
because it's got such a massive body it
takes<00:01:33.220> a<00:01:33.310> lot<00:01:33.430> of<00:01:33.460> energy<00:01:33.910> and<00:01:34.000> a<00:01:34.060> lot<00:01:34.090> of

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:34.300 
takes a lot of energy and a lot of

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.000 
takes a lot of energy and a lot of
processing<00:01:34.870> power<00:01:35.020> to<00:01:35.170> be<00:01:35.320> able<00:01:35.410> to<00:01:35.560> get<00:01:35.800> those

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:36.010 
processing power to be able to get those

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:37.740 
processing power to be able to get those
limbs<00:01:36.370> and<00:01:36.670> things<00:01:36.910> that<00:01:37.030> move<00:01:37.240> accordingly

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:37.750 
limbs and things that move accordingly

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:39.960 
limbs and things that move accordingly
the<00:01:38.140> same<00:01:38.380> goes<00:01:38.590> for<00:01:38.620> elephants<00:01:39.310> and<00:01:39.490> dolphins

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:39.970 
the same goes for elephants and dolphins

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:42.240 
the same goes for elephants and dolphins
but<00:01:40.780> are<00:01:40.900> they<00:01:40.990> smarter<00:01:41.350> than<00:01:41.440> humans<00:01:41.650> well

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:42.250 
but are they smarter than humans well

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:43.770 
but are they smarter than humans well
the<00:01:42.340> smaller<00:01:42.580> brained<00:01:42.850> in<00:01:43.000> them<00:01:43.180> know

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:43.780 
the smaller brained in them know

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:45.960 
the smaller brained in them know
otherwise<00:01:44.590> you'd<00:01:44.860> see<00:01:45.070> giant<00:01:45.460> dolphin

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:45.970 
otherwise you'd see giant dolphin

more<00:04:54.720> efficiently<00:04:55.169> so<00:04:55.440> yes

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:56.280 
more efficiently so yes

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:57.890 
more efficiently so yes
practice<00:04:56.669> does<00:04:56.970> make<00:04:57.000> perfect<00:04:57.210> for

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:08.930 
divided in different sectors under
different<00:05:07.380> things<00:05:07.710> the<00:05:08.340> sector<00:05:08.669> that<00:05:08.789> was

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:08.940 
different things the sector that was

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:10.850 
different things the sector that was
missing<00:05:09.270> was<00:05:09.419> then<00:05:09.630> replaced<00:05:10.169> by<00:05:10.680> another

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:10.860 
missing was then replaced by another

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:13.219 
missing was then replaced by another
sector<00:05:11.490> called<00:05:12.030> the<00:05:12.210> inferior<00:05:12.630> parietal<00:05:12.900> lobe

00:05:13.219 --> 00:05:13.229 
sector called the inferior parietal lobe

00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:15.110 
sector called the inferior parietal lobe
and<00:05:13.500> his<00:05:13.770> parietal<00:05:14.039> lobe<00:05:14.430> in<00:05:14.639> him<00:05:14.880> was

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:15.120 
and his parietal lobe in him was

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:16.999 
and his parietal lobe in him was
actually<00:05:15.449> 15%<00:05:16.139> larger<00:05:16.470> than<00:05:16.620> that<00:05:16.740> of<00:05:16.800> the

00:05:16.999 --> 00:05:17.009 
actually 15% larger than that of the

00:05:17.009 --> 00:05:18.620 
actually 15% larger than that of the
average<00:05:17.160> man<00:05:17.340> but<00:05:18.060> I<00:05:18.090> want<00:05:18.330> you<00:05:18.389> to<00:05:18.449> take<00:05:18.599> a

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:18.630 
average man but I want you to take a

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:20.060 
average man but I want you to take a
guess<00:05:18.870> what<00:05:19.080> do<00:05:19.259> you<00:05:19.349> think<00:05:19.560> the<00:05:19.650> inferior

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:20.070 
guess what do you think the inferior

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:22.700 
guess what do you think the inferior
parietal<00:05:20.310> lobe<00:05:20.610> does<00:05:20.820> well<00:05:21.720> it<00:05:22.320> works<00:05:22.530> with

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:22.710 
parietal lobe does well it works with

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:24.890 
parietal lobe does well it works with
mathematical<00:05:23.370> comprehension<00:05:23.820> in<00:05:24.210> visual<00:05:24.690> and

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:24.900 
mathematical comprehension in visual and

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:27.200 
mathematical comprehension in visual and
imagery<00:05:25.289> movement<00:05:25.889> comprehensions<00:05:26.580> which

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:27.210 
imagery movement comprehensions which

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:30.980 
imagery movement comprehensions which
are<00:05:27.810> two<00:05:28.380> great<00:05:28.919> things<00:05:28.949> to<00:05:29.699> have<00:05:29.909> if<00:05:30.330> you<00:05:30.690> are

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:30.990 
are two great things to have if you are

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:34.159 
are two great things to have if you are
a<00:05:31.110> physicist<00:05:31.919> and<00:05:32.520> what<00:05:33.090> does<00:05:33.210> that<00:05:33.240> mean<00:05:33.630> his

00:05:34.159 --> 00:05:34.169 
a physicist and what does that mean his

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:36.230 
a physicist and what does that mean his
brain<00:05:34.530> was<00:05:34.889> more<00:05:35.190> developed<00:05:35.669> in<00:05:35.759> areas<00:05:35.970> that

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:36.240 
brain was more developed in areas that

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:38.779 
brain was more developed in areas that
are<00:05:36.720> affiliated<00:05:37.710> with<00:05:37.830> complex<00:05:38.430> thought

there<00:05:39.360> are<00:05:39.389> consequences<00:05:39.900> to<00:05:40.380> different

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:40.710 
there are consequences to different

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:42.529 
there are consequences to different
areas<00:05:41.039> in<00:05:41.159> your<00:05:41.190> brain<00:05:41.550> missing<00:05:41.849> but<00:05:42.389> if<00:05:42.449> you'd

00:05:42.529 --> 00:05:42.539 
areas in your brain missing but if you'd

00:05:42.539 --> 00:05:44.060 
areas in your brain missing but if you'd
like<00:05:42.659> to<00:05:42.780> learn<00:05:42.900> more<00:05:42.960> about<00:05:43.259> that<00:05:43.409> I<00:05:43.830> advise

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:44.070 
like to learn more about that I advise

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:45.620 
like to learn more about that I advise
you<00:05:44.099> to<00:05:44.280> venture<00:05:44.639> out<00:05:44.729> on<00:05:44.849> your<00:05:44.970> own<00:05:45.120> so

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:45.630 
you to venture out on your own so

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:47.960 
you to venture out on your own so
technically<00:05:46.409> the<00:05:46.800> size<00:05:47.039> of<00:05:47.220> his<00:05:47.310> brain<00:05:47.610> didn't

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:47.970 
technically the size of his brain didn't

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:50.390 
technically the size of his brain didn't
matter<00:05:48.150> on<00:05:48.539> his<00:05:48.840> intelligence<00:05:49.440> but<00:05:49.740> specific

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:50.400 
matter on his intelligence but specific

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:52.670 
matter on his intelligence but specific
lobes<00:05:50.729> which<00:05:51.419> is<00:05:51.599> specifically<00:05:52.139> what<00:05:52.530> has

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:52.680 
lobes which is specifically what has

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:55.219 
lobes which is specifically what has
made<00:05:52.800> us<00:05:52.979> as<00:05:53.190> an<00:05:53.460> organism<00:05:53.969> so<00:05:54.539> much<00:05:54.810> smarter

00:05:55.219 --> 00:05:55.229 
made us as an organism so much smarter

00:05:55.229 --> 00:05:57.260 
made us as an organism so much smarter
having<00:05:55.949> a<00:05:56.009> much<00:05:56.190> more<00:05:56.400> developed<00:05:56.909> frontal

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:57.270 
having a much more developed frontal

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:59.600 
having a much more developed frontal
cortex<00:05:57.690> compared<00:05:58.020> to<00:05:58.080> other<00:05:58.199> primates<00:05:58.610> like

00:05:59.600 --> 00:05:59.610 
cortex compared to other primates like

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:01.760 
cortex compared to other primates like
this<00:05:59.849> chart<00:06:00.150> shows<00:06:00.210> really<00:06:01.199> proves<00:06:01.530> how

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:01.770 
this chart shows really proves how

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:04.279 
this chart shows really proves how
intelligent<00:06:02.340> our<00:06:02.400> species<00:06:02.820> is<00:06:03.060> so<00:06:03.719> to<00:06:03.780> answer

00:06:04.279 --> 00:06:04.289 
intelligent our species is so to answer

00:06:04.289 --> 00:06:06.080 
intelligent our species is so to answer
the<00:06:04.380> question<00:06:04.830> does<00:06:05.280> the<00:06:05.430> size<00:06:05.639> of<00:06:05.759> your<00:06:05.880> brain

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:06.090 
the question does the size of your brain

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:08.899 
the question does the size of your brain
really<00:06:06.479> impact<00:06:07.139> how<00:06:07.500> smart<00:06:08.250> you<00:06:08.370> are<00:06:08.400> and<00:06:08.729> I

00:06:08.899 --> 00:06:08.909 
really impact how smart you are and I

00:06:08.909 --> 00:06:10.850 
really impact how smart you are and I
guess<00:06:09.060> the<00:06:09.210> answer<00:06:09.630> to<00:06:09.840> that<00:06:09.870> is<00:06:10.199> it<00:06:10.710> all

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:10.860 
guess the answer to that is it all

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:12.200 
guess the answer to that is it all
depends<00:06:11.219> on<00:06:11.460> what<00:06:11.610> part<00:06:11.759> of<00:06:11.909> your<00:06:12.000> brain<00:06:12.180> is

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:12.210 
depends on what part of your brain is

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:13.700 
depends on what part of your brain is
bigger<00:06:12.539> so<00:06:12.990> the<00:06:13.050> next<00:06:13.199> time<00:06:13.380> you<00:06:13.500> want<00:06:13.650> to

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:13.710 
bigger so the next time you want to

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:15.980 
bigger so the next time you want to
relieve<00:06:13.949> a<00:06:13.979> remark<00:06:14.490> about<00:06:14.699> how<00:06:15.180> smart<00:06:15.659> someone

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:15.990 
relieve a remark about how smart someone

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:17.659 
relieve a remark about how smart someone
is<00:06:16.289> but<00:06:16.710> you<00:06:16.800> don't<00:06:16.949> want<00:06:17.070> to<00:06:17.130> sound<00:06:17.250> dumb<00:06:17.520> by

00:06:17.659 --> 00:06:17.669 
is but you don't want to sound dumb by

00:06:17.669 --> 00:06:19.339 
is but you don't want to sound dumb by
saying<00:06:17.969> you<00:06:18.090> must<00:06:18.210> have<00:06:18.419> a<00:06:18.449> big<00:06:18.630> brain<00:06:18.900> tell

00:06:19.339 --> 00:06:19.349 
saying you must have a big brain tell

00:06:19.349 --> 00:06:21.020 
saying you must have a big brain tell
them<00:06:19.469> they<00:06:19.620> have<00:06:19.740> a<00:06:19.770> highly<00:06:20.219> developed<00:06:20.250> brain
