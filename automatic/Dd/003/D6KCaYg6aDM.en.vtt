00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:10.030
 Hello viewers channel 

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:14.620
 today we will show how to 

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:18.590
 check the suspension units on the car 

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:22.360
 first of all not raising the car is not 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:24.020
 Immediately you can see the status of the supports 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:28.369
 front struts 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:30.410
 we will see them by this gap 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:33.500
 we see that we have one side a little 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:36.379
 less than the other but in principle this 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:40.660
 still allowable clearance if you have more 

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:43.850
 1 there is limits 1 there is one and a half centimeters 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:45.110
 here in the cup it says that 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:49.329
 you have broken support 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:52.329
 she is already sagging and needs to be changed 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:55.760
 and it is very important that he stood exactly 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:57.520
 the wheels were straight and watch this one 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.079
 gap 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:03.110
 You can also link it to download 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:05.000
 car check up and 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:06.759
 Patrons car should not 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.070
 and download first must 

00:01:06.759 --> 00:01:12.920
 swing a little effort 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:15.520
 I must repeat then I must play 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.520
 stay close 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:21.470
 then and so what we're looking at now 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.869
 front suspension 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:27.650
 just how we raised the car right away 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:30.680
 view the presence of stains availability 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:31.610
 oil drips on the shock absorbers also 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:34.159
 state 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:37.340
 chipper what's very important 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:40.189
 if the bump in the bathroom already received by 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:42.080
 a common absent c says 

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:45.130
 most likely that you stand out of 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:50.450
 building me too for the winter 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:52.820
 then after inspecting the shock absorber here 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.390
 so swinging horizontally 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.880
 wheel 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:57.290
 and download your completely do not need the role 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:00.380
 enough to take 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:03.890
 movement if there is no backlash go to 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.549
 the next is also very important 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:07.369
 look 

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:07.909
 not like or spring and whether it is in place 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:10.310
 is sitting 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:12.880
 that is, here is the end and I must be 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.540
 here is a sword 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:23.450
 here he is 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:25.420
 no longer sitting with us exactly so ducks 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:28.420
 we can even hear a light knock and 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.420
 swinging 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:34.090
 there is no vertical 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:37.519
 bearings also here if you stop and 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:40.420
 yes then you here fist hand vibration 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:42.950
 will give and bearings 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:44.900
 most often to fails in them 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:56.510
 vertical backlash is still available 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:57.889
 if not, then in this case 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:01.159
 us play in the steering rack 

00:02:57.889 --> 00:03:02.750
 it is very easy to check it so generally with 

00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:05.329
 left side and backlash in the steering rack 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:10.120
 very frequent here we are a little bit 

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:13.430
 won the wheel and take here for the traction and 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:17.389
 before downloading up and down we have 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:18.760
 here's a jew strike about her retreating 

00:03:17.389 --> 00:03:22.129
 nothing wrong with that 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:22.720
 also the ball moves in principle 

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:27.260
 supports 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:30.379
 If I have a strong backlash, we can because 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:33.709
 swing the lever up down or in so 

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:35.540
 there will be sometimes more steps when 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:38.150
 fails so may the lever not 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:40.790
 swing also swing the wheel 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:43.510
 from Antalya lever we will have to go top 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:46.010
 bottom is the same with a strong-willed tip 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:48.139
 principle, you can try the top bottom 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:50.750
 so now push right and left he walk 

00:03:48.139 --> 00:03:53.150
 should and up down in the ball 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:55.970
 no, that is, itâ€™s possible 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:58.970
 building even if they don't knock but 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:04.400
 tip so here it is forced when 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:07.790
 the fact that he soon you quickly and further we 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:10.250
 we can check the condition of the sleeves and racks 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:12.079
 stabilizer as for racks 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:14.540
 stabilizer and worse check under 

00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:17.209
 load that is when the car 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:19.150
 omitted and rock and see whether walks 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:21.790
 we have this cup up 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:24.940
 regarding the lever she will jump and 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:28.060
 knock knock stabilizer 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:30.430
 enough to download for stabilizer arm 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:32.080
 even on you private car and right here 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:34.870
 we now we see that that 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:38.100
 stabilizer sits dead if bushings and 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:38.100
 it will be broken a little bit 

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:45.699
 engine support enough swing arm 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:48.520
 for the engine if it does not hang well 

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:49.470
 Basically, the native fields here will be prominent on 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:52.810
 mane 

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:54.789
 also sambuca leverage principle on 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:55.750
 posted car will also be visible 

00:04:54.789 --> 00:04:58.720
 if they are broken 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:05:03.370
 also the same swing the wheel 

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:08.710
 it is possible to download and watch better 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:11.199
 do we have a lever to move like that 

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:14.169
 there is a jumping its block we sit 

00:05:11.199 --> 00:05:17.800
 energy if there is a slight play og them 

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:20.680
 need to be replaced is also very important 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:22.620
 moment check the status of all 

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:24.880
 anthers in general absolutely everyone and 

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:26.710
 pay special attention to the internal 

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:35.710
 film drive left there on it 

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:38.289
 swelling mass so go to the back 

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:40.510
 rear suspension 

00:05:38.289 --> 00:05:43.659
 much less running gear than 

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:46.210
 front we are interested in the condition of the rear 

00:05:43.659 --> 00:05:47.889
 shock absorbers are sure to draw 

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:50.380
 attention to the state of this thing 

00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:52.659
 rubber they happen slips out will 

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:55.090
 generally pops up well and naturally 

00:05:52.659 --> 00:05:56.620
 smudges dampers it 

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:58.659
 operability is possible either on 

00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:01.539
 lowered the car also swing 

00:05:58.659 --> 00:06:04.599
 either remove the remove analyzer and see 

00:06:01.539 --> 00:06:07.800
 also the state of the spring seats 

00:06:04.599 --> 00:06:11.440
 so that the seats were supports and 

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:15.599
 top and bottom naturally fasten 

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:15.599
 wheels for extraneous noise 

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:22.650
 can still look for dignity 

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:22.650
 mybook in the rear beam 

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:33.490
 we look at the presence of tears heating here 

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:36.280
 not available also very important with 

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:39.970
 love is now your not 

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:42.910
 tears without on 2 of a from is famous 

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:44.950
 inner sleeve from risen in principle 

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:47.170
 salt the God we see what you are here here 

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:50.920
 on the right there is a little small 

00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:53.050
 the gap here is the right strange gap 

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:54.820
 if it is not , we get one block 

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:58.600
 very much like this 

00:06:54.820 --> 00:07:01.840
 this is what you need early sleeve either 

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:03.760
 unscrew these three bolts for 16 well 

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:06.580
 naturally backed by the pillars somehow and 

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:09.970
 could not be replaced and the swing 

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:15.040
 for the bracket if it dangles easily on 

00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:16.870
 plasterer also look here to cable 

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:20.550
 everywhere was securely fixed he too 

00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:20.550
 sometimes gives an extra point
