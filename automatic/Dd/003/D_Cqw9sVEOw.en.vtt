this problem but we need a will we need
a<00:03:09.580> leader<00:03:09.850> who's<00:03:10.060> going<00:03:10.240> to<00:03:10.300> come<00:03:10.510> in<00:03:10.720> and

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:16.270 
are tripping over each other I think

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:17.520 
are tripping over each other I think
there<00:03:16.390> could<00:03:16.480> be<00:03:16.540> alignment<00:03:17.050> both<00:03:17.200> at<00:03:17.410> the

I also believe that there should be some

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.150 
local level so one of the things that I

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:56.940 
local level so one of the things that I
find<00:03:55.330> very<00:03:55.480> interesting<00:03:55.989> about<00:03:56.500> learning<00:03:56.770> in

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:56.950 
find very interesting about learning in

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:59.460 
find very interesting about learning in
this<00:03:57.040> country<00:03:57.489> is<00:03:57.670> that<00:03:57.900> sixty<00:03:58.900> percent<00:03:59.020> of

00:03:59.460 --> 00:03:59.470 
this country is that sixty percent of

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:01.949 
this country is that sixty percent of
our<00:03:59.620> US<00:03:59.860> population<00:04:00.630> does<00:04:01.630> not<00:04:01.660> have<00:04:01.810> a

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:13.480 
think both campaigns have done done a

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:15.270 
think both campaigns have done done a
good<00:04:13.750> job<00:04:13.810> of<00:04:13.989> talking<00:04:14.230> about<00:04:14.560> jobs<00:04:14.860> my

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:15.280 
good job of talking about jobs my

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:16.590 
good job of talking about jobs my
questions<00:04:15.730> to<00:04:15.880> both<00:04:16.030> of<00:04:16.180> them<00:04:16.299> are<00:04:16.419> going<00:04:16.539> to

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:16.600 
questions to both of them are going to

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:18.029 
questions to both of them are going to
be<00:04:16.660> what<00:04:16.989> happens<00:04:17.289> if<00:04:17.410> the<00:04:17.500> unemployment<00:04:17.859> rate

00:04:18.029 --> 00:04:18.039 
be what happens if the unemployment rate

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:19.529 
be what happens if the unemployment rate
goes<00:04:18.280> up<00:04:18.370> to<00:04:18.489> eight<00:04:18.549> nine<00:04:18.760> percent<00:04:19.150> as<00:04:19.330> a
