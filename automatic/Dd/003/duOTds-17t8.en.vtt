00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:08.480
 hello to all the team of spaceships the 

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:10.610
 Dr. White we are here today with the 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:13.610
 review of the third and last player 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:17.090
 of this team of the week classes a 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:19.340
 nothing then we leave the series to have 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:21.439
 seen pjanic and fernandez you find them 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:24.380
 both in the dedicated playlist though 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:26.320
 then on the minds and we move on to 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:29.240
 bundesliga with dedication with a striker 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:31.160
 which has interesting statistics 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:33.670
 above all a shot that is really 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.989
 a high value with 89 more than 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:37.250
 many other players 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:39.350
 speed could be a problem 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:42.260
 in any case we see how it behaves in 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:45.769
 field starting right from the speed 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:47.420
 speed that is not very high fast 

00:00:45.769 --> 00:00:51.739
 so he will bet he is not a fast player 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:53.720
 it has only 69 so it is below the average of the 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:56.330
 other strikers maybe of bond and sting 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:58.850
 mobile a ramos etc exciting it 

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:00.979
 same lewandowski is slower in one 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:03.350
 speed may not be a problem 

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:05.990
 the real problem is war games 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:08.240
 medium to medium which cause a tran 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:09.560
 never brings close to the penalty area where 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.020
 must stay where speed is not 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:14.780
 important but should receive more ball 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:16.490
 back then making it difficult 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:18.530
 going to port would bring out so many 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:22.070
 really men and it's a shame then 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:24.289
 speed not at the top physical strength not 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:26.689
 a bit of physical duels is very bad 

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:29.149
 He manages to win 2, however, a good 

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:31.759
 physical strength but speed e 

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:32.810
 acceleration I am a malus for how much 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:35.390
 it's about shooting 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:38.329
 we also say here the malus derives from the 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:40.189
 world because you pass a value 

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:42.649
 different or very high above 90 

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:44.299
 therefore one thinks that he always finalizes the 

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:45.799
 problem is that it is difficult to find it in 

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:48.020
 middle of the area in the right place at 

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:49.819
 right time because with the excuse that a 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.899
 this work that brings you a lot of time 

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:53.929
 far 

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:56.060
 will hardly be in the penalty area for 

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:58.369
 maybe take advantage of our cross maybe 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.079
 12 etc. city in any case is a 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:02.229
 player who easily succeeds in 

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:04.369
 sure to score makes some mistakes 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:07.130
 especially after the last patch I don't know 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:08.869
 what they have changed but I have to say that 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.729
 even the four stars are good 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:11.630
 weak foot then promoted below 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:15.659
 this point of view 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:18.819
 as for dribbling instead 

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:21.069
 limited as a player because he is not a 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:24.280
 skillful player like ibrahimovic that 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:27.010
 despite being much higher than 14 cm it is 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.810
 really agile huntelaar has only three 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:31.390
 stars ski so you can't do them skill 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:33.670
 and in general suffers a little certain ho 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:35.170
 seen of worse type a berbatov 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.939
 etc. etc. 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:38.019
 but I expect not to say that I am 

00:02:36.939 --> 00:02:41.079
 I was expecting something more because 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:42.189
 however the dribbling agility is not 

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:44.859
 one of the main qualities of a 

00:02:42.189 --> 00:02:47.379
 strong striker in the penalty area though 

00:02:44.859 --> 00:02:49.599
 with the excuse that he receives a lot of ball 

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:51.159
 far from this penalty area it would be 

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:54.129
 It was better to have a player with 

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:55.900
 slightly more dribbling as far as 

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:57.730
 concerns rigors and punishments summer came 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:00.040
 a great rigorist did one year 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:03.280
 really many goals on a penalty and the 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:05.260
 punishment despite not having values 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.900
 exceptional therefore does not have the values ​​of 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:11.560
 a blue conceal for example speaking of 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:13.239
 bundesliga players and do not paint 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.889
 draw mingardi goalkeeper businesses 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:16.419
 close with a header shot in 

00:03:14.889 --> 00:03:18.189
 head that is not bad when you do 

00:03:16.419 --> 00:03:19.720
 find ready in the penalty area is in 

00:03:18.189 --> 00:03:21.579
 able to score even head maybe 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:24.190
 he would have been the perfect striker for 

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:26.290
 cheer on the last 14 head-shot teams 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:28.090
 they were really devastating that he had been 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:30.909
 recommended to force we must increase 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:32.590
 according to me the speed in this case 

00:03:30.909 --> 00:03:35.260
 end I did or soccer players that increases 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:38.019
 speed and throw or engine that increases the 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:39.639
 speed passing and dribbling where 

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:42.220
 use this player I will 

00:03:39.639 --> 00:03:45.069
 I recommend a 4 3 2 1 as a single tip 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:47.439
 especially for what we do 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:49.030
 huntelaar will go and get the ball because 

00:03:47.439 --> 00:03:51.099
 which spits up test organs 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:53.919
 really takes a lot can do 

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:56.590
 move the ball so he lowers 

00:03:53.919 --> 00:03:59.109
 takes the head ball the spice towards 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:00.909
 urban anglo royce than in the open field 

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:03.790
 they can go wild with their speed 

00:04:00.909 --> 00:04:05.739
 extraordinary and then it can be useful anyway 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:07.599
 boateng that fits that clear from 

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:09.389
 a reference also he therefore a 

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:12.370
 drama some kind of play maker 

00:04:09.389 --> 00:04:14.590
 advanced because it receives the high ball with the 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:18.789
 head puts it down for the various players 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:20.120
 or in a 4 4 1 1 of the with players 

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:22.280
 Dutch put it 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:25.190
 Sneijder wian du nursing and then we 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:26.750
 they are very technical players who must 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:29.180
 only to receive from an already pages of 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:30.919
 daily can jump with the excellent 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:33.680
 dribbling pie 5 star skill then 

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:35.540
 really not bad though let's remember a 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:38.120
 trash as a unique tip because so 

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:40.070
 take the ball and sort it a little thanks to 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:41.150
 on referrals above all thanks to the 

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:42.740
 great header 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:44.000
 in conclusion it is a discreet 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:46.820
 finalizer because we have seen that 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.500
 however marks the physical is ok so 

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:49.820
 nothing to say about physical strength the 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:51.320
 header one of his weapons 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:53.180
 main and above all four 

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:54.380
 stars weak foot then the network of 

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:56.419
 right than left 

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:58.729
 by contrast, the average world media at the 

00:04:56.419 --> 00:05:00.380
 penalizes a little he had medium high 

00:04:58.729 --> 00:05:03.260
 it would have been perfect 

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:05.539
 dribbling is not that good not so 

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:08.000
 low cost because in any case what about 30 thousand 

00:05:05.539 --> 00:05:10.250
 for xbox and 40 thousand on playstation 

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.229
 then immobile ahram choupo moting 

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:14.470
 etc. etc. cost much less and 

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:16.340
 agility is not at the top so it could 

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:18.260
 penalize him a little so not just a 

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:20.300
 six and a half I expect great things not 

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:22.220
 true of a second version in one 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:24.020
 destiny version at the end of the year we will see a 

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:27.789
 this is my review on ent 

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:27.789
 we will see each other soon
