00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:15.940
 Mexican football we are now 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.150
 three neighbors fans as they are me 

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:33.640
 It gives much pleasure to greet as good as 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:35.200
 I imagine they must be happy 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.210
 for the triumph of the America that almost 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.040
 almost put the eagles in the group or 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:41.230
 that blue cross arrived and then it wound up 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:45.280
 toluca in the bonbonniere or the triumph of 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:47.650
 Cougars in Cancun but good and the truth 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:50.199
 that I after what happened with what 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:51.610
 Paul Aguilar of all comments 

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:54.309
 all the comments they told me 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:56.920
 well, sincerely, he does it as a block 

00:00:54.309 --> 00:01:00.100
 I'm going to extend my truth 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:01.750
 helping hand if we were going to make a truce 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:05.049
 so or are they peace 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:07.600
 I promise not to speak ill of you 

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:09.460
 Mexican football because that's worse than 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.560
 if you insult your mom or your sister 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:14.500
 I realized that you can not stand 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:17.619
 nothing, they all take it to heart 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:19.810
 and the truth is that I do not know they do not know 

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:22.090
 distinguish what is a criticism if 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:24.070
 I'm wanting to make them see that 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:26.350
 see the face that is not worth the 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.970
 Mexican football but good, well, I do not know 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:29.950
 can we better let's talk about the good 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:32.469
 who is coming this week 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:34.750
 and they win seven days they wait for us two 

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:37.390
 championship games go real madrid 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:39.969
 chelsea barcelona and the classic 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:42.340
 barcelona-real madrid few weeks as 

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:44.439
 it's in the history of football but 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.960
 well let's go with the game of the bayern 

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:48.640
 yunis real madrid if there is a team that 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.250
 you can beat Real Madrid and you can 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:54.100
 he had said is the bayern munich no 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:57.460
 will have the figures since they are worth from 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:02:00.009
 million dollars I do not know as a Christian 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:02.409
 ronaldo as kaka as benzema but the 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:06.039
 team that has stopped jupp heynckes 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:09.009
 it's extremely good he 's back 

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:13.420
 ivica olic bastian schweinsteiger thomas 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:16.000
 mine is frank ribery is mario 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:18.670
 Gomez can hit Real Madrid without 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.370
 no problem much will have to do 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:23.440
 what mesut özil can do against 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.750
 bastian schweinsteiger is very well known 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:27.760
 well of selection and power and what 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.500
 that can be mario gómez against 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.930
 Real Madrid defense that suddenly 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:34.780
 it's where you're weakening if it's going to be 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:36.430
 a super interesting match like 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:38.920
 that on Wednesday 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:41.109
 chelsea barcelona if there is a team 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:43.480
 also that you can hit the barcelona 

00:02:41.109 --> 00:02:45.040
 that brings the desire for revenge of what 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.290
 happened in 2009 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.719
 that is the chelsea that comes from winning 51 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:52.810
 in the ugly cope he got in the final and 

00:02:49.719 --> 00:02:55.569
 then a great match is not expected but 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:57.639
 well let's give the comments are 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:03:00.549
 many unfortunately I can not read 

00:02:57.639 --> 00:03:03.980
 all but let's answer some of 

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:07.580
 your doubts come from there 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:09.560
 the tree took the good of all the poison 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:12.140
 that you express and understand that you are the 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:14.299
 villain in the criticism that is needed not 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:17.180
 I communicate in everything you say because I am 

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:19.220
 of those who still think strongly that in 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:21.739
 Mexico will one day be world champion 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:24.610
 I will continue to listen and criticize you 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:27.300
 because I have the right as well as your 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:29.880
 regards 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:33.060
 to my dear friend you have all the 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:35.400
 right to criticize me here I am 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:37.560
 I'm not god, I'm not perfect, I say 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:40.470
 things because I want them to see the reality 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:43.230
 they always give them atole with their finger 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:45.420
 the television stations of the federation and 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:48.000
 you believe it, enough is enough 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:50.820
 are believing things man and if 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.760
 I am open to all criticism, not no 

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:55.770
 I can be perfect in everything and forward 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.780
 you have your right to criticize now that 

00:03:55.770 --> 00:04:00.000
 you say that you still expect to see 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:02.340
 mexico world champion someday I the 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.410
 I really do not believe it because of everything 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:06.960
 seen in these 80 years of football 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:09.150
 international and anything else why not 

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:12.120
 I think that Mexico, that champion of the 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:14.130
 world at an important level that is worth not 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:16.080
 child categories or anything to 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:18.480
 forward I also send you a greeting and 

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:20.540
 come you have to make team let's go all the 

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:22.940
 Whats Next 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:26.660
 There is a magnet 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:28.880
 with poison answers my question if the 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:31.340
 Mexican league is as bad as you say 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:34.139
 because the fifa puts it in the 'top ten' 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:37.919
 of the best leagues in the world 

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:40.110
 I remain raul to see why if I criticize 

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:41.819
 to my class because the fifa puts mexico 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:45.029
 within the 'top ten' of the best 

00:04:41.819 --> 00:04:46.409
 leagues of the world to start or be between 

00:04:45.029 --> 00:04:47.789
 the fifa and the federation of history and 

00:04:46.409 --> 00:04:49.560
 statistics are what make these 

00:04:47.789 --> 00:04:51.870
 types of rankings that suddenly one 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:54.090
 nobody understands because they are very equations 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:56.969
 complicated but fast is going to tell you 

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:59.310
 if the tournaments are taken into account 

00:04:56.969 --> 00:05:00.900
 national yes and the tournaments 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:02.310
 international or whether the results 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:03.749
 have the clubs in that kind of 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:05.789
 tournaments for example at level 

00:05:03.749 --> 00:05:07.919
 international that Mexico competes in the 

00:05:05.789 --> 00:05:10.770
 concacaf and that always comes because 

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:12.629
 truth is the country that has the highest level 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:14.699
 within the concacaf as it is not going to 

00:05:12.629 --> 00:05:17.069
 be in the 'top ten' if you add all 

00:05:14.699 --> 00:05:19.199
 those points and nothing else input you give 

00:05:17.069 --> 00:05:20.610
 account that the last four endings of 

00:05:19.199 --> 00:05:23.039
 the concachampions are teams 

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:25.139
 Mexicans and there are four Mexican teams 

00:05:23.039 --> 00:05:27.029
 in concachampios 3 that it is in the 

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:28.409
 'top ten' and suddenly one or two 

00:05:27.029 --> 00:05:30.839
 good performance in the liberators or the 

00:05:28.409 --> 00:05:33.060
 South American from some team because 

00:05:30.839 --> 00:05:34.979
 that and that's why Spain is number one 

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:36.659
 because if it's real lately 

00:05:34.979 --> 00:05:38.789
 madrid-barcelona up and in europe 

00:05:36.659 --> 00:05:39.910
 league there are three Spanish teams 

00:05:38.789 --> 00:05:42.160
 that, but 

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:44.500
 the reality inside you realize 

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:46.980
 that the level that is played in Mexico nothing 

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:50.050
 what to do with a place in a table 

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:52.810
 Virtual we could say that is that so 

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:55.510
 number 10 is number 11 of league is very 

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:57.250
 liar you just see the other leagues 

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:59.920
 like Argentina the truth if the one of 

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:01.540
 chile if you were going to see in the quality of 

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:03.720
 football there are see let's go to the one 

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:08.280
 follow 

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:11.340
 live mexico chemo dear don poison me 

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:12.630
 like to know what you think is the 

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:16.480
 best league in the world 

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:19.180
 I'd love to hear your answer 

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:23.020
 now I want me to live mexico that I 

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:26.800
 multen come from there which I think it is 

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:29.260
 the best league in the world for me and eye 

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:33.010
 for me because then they say that I 

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:36.490
 I hallucinate the bundesliga because three things 

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:37.960
 is where there is better entry where there 

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:40.870
 best average attendance at 

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:43.000
 matches because the tickets for the 

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:45.820
 stadiums are very accessible for 

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:48.700
 people are seen without having the big 

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:51.820
 stars like Spanish football or the 

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:54.580
 English football there is a very level 

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:56.500
 important of competitiveness the truth 

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:58.510
 awesome and you see a match 

00:06:56.500 --> 00:07:00.520
 of the bundesliga from both sides and not 

00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:03.730
 the more they see the ball as I passed in 

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:06.610
 england or not teams if with their 

00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:08.230
 resources if they play from one side to the other 

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:10.150
 side to side from side to side if 

00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:12.400
 they saw the match see schalke evolution 

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:13.780
 they will understand me what I mean another 

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:16.090
 because I think that slam in one of the 

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:17.890
 best leagues or the best league for him 

00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:20.500
 for that situation to happen, the clubs 

00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:23.500
 they have to be in black numbers and the 

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:25.990
 German teams do not have the big 

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:28.810
 but neither are they bankrupt as 

00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:30.550
 happens with many Spanish teams yes or 

00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:33.160
 as lately has happened with the 

00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:35.020
 English teams and what money that 

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:37.690
 he gives them television in england is 

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:40.150
 very much not so much in Spain where the 

00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:42.130
 wool deal is not the same and that's why 

00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:43.690
 barcelona and real madrid go up 

00:07:42.130 --> 00:07:46.660
