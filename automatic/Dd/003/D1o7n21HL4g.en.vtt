00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:40.650

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:43.020
 where the other job 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.320
 Jaap de Groot grew up 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.730
 the same crime as and that is formulating 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:50.390
 Pechtold 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:53.390
 the long-haired hemprechts a hospital 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.030
 rtl boulevard 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:06.260
 make a reservation on a fixed income 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.260

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:16.410
 put the head 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:19.410

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.320
 the palm the pupils 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.240

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:38.620
 next fall he also acted to worry about 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:39.979
 mainly 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:42.979
 lies a little discovery 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.880
 these spicy parties 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:57.290
 thanks to a growing line for the body itself 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:03.030
 on the side cynical arnhem 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.030
 neede simple the curved the line 

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:12.969
 adha 

00:02:12.969 --> 00:02:14.239
 8 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:16.340
 all attention 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.370
 so in this case 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:19.599
 paul vugts 

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:22.599
 articles break for a long time 

00:02:28.469 --> 00:02:29.889
 romney others 

00:02:29.889 --> 00:02:31.079
 regime 

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:35.089
 and then it appears it is as if it has not failed their actions 

00:02:36.679 --> 00:02:39.679
 3 maybe just like others looked at 

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:45.659
 against this group of women on top of his stomach 

00:02:50.999 --> 00:02:53.609
 drawing at the foot 

00:02:53.609 --> 00:02:55.599
 next to the agenda 

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:58.579
 8 

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:01.579
 if this can come artificial grass 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:06.039
 the artwork is a bit 

00:03:06.039 --> 00:03:07.849
 succeeded 

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:10.849
 they draw first there are different feet and each 

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:15.449
 it must be different that can cell under 

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:22.639
 bending the lines a bit, it also appears that the ladies kiss a little 

00:03:22.639 --> 00:03:25.639
 found in time 

00:03:26.249 --> 00:03:28.399
 9 under the name 

00:03:28.399 --> 00:03:31.399

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:46.549
 8 

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:52.699
 we must go for it 

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:55.469
 thicker in the train 

00:03:55.469 --> 00:03:58.839
 but here too a very simple line is used 

00:03:58.839 --> 00:04:01.839
 kind of this save the investor 

00:04:03.689 --> 00:04:07.049
 everything drawn with pencil 

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:12.029
 what I am going to do now 6 trace all nec the porter 

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:17.769
 in uncertainty for me 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:23.129
 so we can first get obama head to tail again the arrogant jellyfish 

00:04:23.129 --> 00:04:26.210

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:54.330
 proven track 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:59.169
 make it huge 

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:00.909
 big projects 

00:05:00.909 --> 00:05:03.789
 mb national regulation 

00:05:03.789 --> 00:05:07.710
 the all signed municipality 

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:10.710
 artists seems short-term if it is a bit 

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:24.830
 half the year 

00:05:32.729 --> 00:05:35.710
 structure according to the same 

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:37.319
 blue 

00:05:37.319 --> 00:05:39.129

 when i am in color 

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:45.289
 it is clearly not everywhere to save my teammates equally hard otherwise get 

00:05:45.289 --> 00:05:48.180
 you get a bit of that color difference between maintenance 

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:53.210
 as a brand your colleague does have an option to purchase 

00:05:54.089 --> 00:05:57.500
 every week a little to keep in mind this is not 

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:00.500
