00:00:00.949 --> 00:00:07.589
 and welcome to a new video 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:10.110
 make moment short so today I show 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:12.150
 make you like you really cool willi 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.509
 can do with a 50 kubik 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.509
 cylinder 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:18.990
 requirement is unfortunately one 

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:23.430
 Sport exhaust part otherwise not the 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:25.770
 the one that has the thrust 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.000
 can this so I do not say to 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:27.390
 Anyway a sport exhaust should be alright 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.270
 his 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.740
 and works very simply that 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:32.879
 it does not make anyone in the case but 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.800
 you can do it like that when you're on 

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:37.140
 goes and somehow so people 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.030
 impressed today makes it easy 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.850
 you because how does he work that is 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.530
 relatively easy I try on camera 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.230
 to get 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:48.150
 you are influencing foods 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.589
 immediately moved forward with the 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:53.070
 body tilted slightly backwards and 

00:00:49.589 --> 00:00:54.510
 also generally hold the steering wheel 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.280
 do not pull it up it goes off 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.540
 alone but just with the 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.540
 press left foot upwards 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:18.270
 on 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:33.140
 I do not know if you saw it exactly 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.700
 definitely has left foot easily 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.710
 move forward as far as you can 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.290
 and then while gassing with the left 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:41.360
 press foot off is a bit 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:42.650
 but like with a 50 cylinder 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.240
 I can not keep it up I try you 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:48.340
 a little better by showing 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:50.240
 he looks from the front and yes that 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.470
 important is the steering wheel you need 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.000
 do not tear up just fine 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:58.130
 hold on to the body slightly 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:59.720
 lean back so that you hold yours 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.670
 focus shifted immediately to the rear 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:04.030
 is so evident now again from 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:04.030
 ahead 

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:46.250
 Ever again, exercise makes the master so 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:48.110
 when I see you in the first team 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:52.310
 not so perfect friend with me 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:53.920
 I have a traffic light right but now 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:55.790
 So you see, it's a release 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:56.900
 front wheel forward is cool around 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:58.550
 to impress or have an impression 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:00.460
 Round it was actually the trick 

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:02.060
 is actually at the front 

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:03.500
 sitting position a bit backwards 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:06.350
 shift and also slightly backwards 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:08.060
 lean the steering wheel does not need her 

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:10.460
 simply jerk it up 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:12.320
 hold on that and then 

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:13.700
 it also works for all questions 

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:16.670
 like to return to the comments one 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:17.840
 rating I would be happy and that 

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:19.820
 that still with the video we see 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:22.790
 us at the next video I would say 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:26.470
 So that's probably 90 percent 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:26.470
 the falls is so pure
