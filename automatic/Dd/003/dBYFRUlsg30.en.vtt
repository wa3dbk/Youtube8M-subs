00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:18.590
 always place to get a degree 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:19.910
 more than exclusivity and this is a clear 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:21.860
 example of it 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:25.940
 Argentine profession launched an edition 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:29.000
 limited to 60 units of its rc coupe 

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:30.500
 a concept is called in charge and it 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.469
 difference with the conventional version 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:35.960
 for some aesthetic details between 

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:38.690
 which the most outstanding is the roof 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:40.550
 of brilliant carbon that I propose that 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:43.370
 today in news on wheels we know 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:47.469
 well in detail this limited edition of 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.469
 the lion's brand insignia teacher 

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:53.900
 because like her 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:56.150
 in this special edition there are no changes 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:59.059
 mechanics keep the master or 4 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:02.989
 1.6 liter supercharged cylinders 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:05.300
 16 valves and 200 horsepower a 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:07.700
 propeller developed jointly with 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:10.310
 group mwv mated to a 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:13.340
 6-speed manual is an engine that 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:15.530
 allows quick exits to have a 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.690
 excellent elasticity and feel that 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:20.180
 will always have an answer to the request 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:22.369
 from the accelerator to the relations of the 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:24.830
 six gears works very well for 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:27.500
 200 horsepower though 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:30.470
 being a sport the lowest are 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.970
 something short in addition to the opposite of what 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:34.430
 as with most 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:37.130
 sports achieve very good values ​​of 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:40.070
 consumption from the passenger compartment you receive a 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:42.229
 nice and particular purr that is 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:44.090
 because the engineers devised a 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:46.759
 membrane that vibrates upon contact 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:49.759
 with the intake air this original 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:51.920
 device is called the sound system the 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:54.020
 extremely rigid chassis and the 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.520
 hard setting of the suspensions you 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.930
 they grant a very good behavior 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.770
 dynamic 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:02.120
 and he showed it when we demanded it thoroughly 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:03.920
 fortunately, that hardness is not 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:06.320
 becomes a torture when it comes to 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.970
 circulate around the city to a large extent 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.039
 for how well it absorbs 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:12.020
 imperfections and in that they also have 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:14.660
 a lot to see the tires that do not 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:16.490
 they have such a low profile although we have 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:18.770
 that to say it you also have to have 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:23.140
 be careful with the loins and the gutters 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:23.140
 the scant clearance of the rcz 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:27.580
 well dayz 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:43.150
 provides recipe was released in 

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:46.060
 our country in January 2011 and it's already here 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:48.460
 commercialized more than 400 units a 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:50.950
 very interesting figure considering 

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:53.320
 that is not a product that comes to be 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:55.210
 volume in terms of sales and did not come to 

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:58.120
 raise the image of the brand in our 

00:02:55.210 --> 00:03:00.610
 market to differentiate itself further from 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:03.550
 other generalist firms also 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:05.680
 allows the lion's brand to follow that 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:08.040
 path that seeks so much towards the high 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.040
 spectrum 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:16.760
 This special series adds elegance 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:18.980
 and sportsmanship with a carbon roof 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:21.220
 bright built and inspired by the 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:24.440
 technology of the world of competition 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:26.420
 the parapet of metal arched simulated 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:28.670
 goes from the base of the windshield to the 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:31.240
 beginning of the trunk is one of the details 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:33.800
 highlights of a silhouette that appeals 

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:35.780
 essentially to the curves when this 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:38.060
 model was still in prototype stage 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:40.010
 It seemed unfeasible that the roof with the 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:42.440
 double bulge was standard 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:44.720
 however, but I did it and it's for 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:47.510
 highlight since the cost of development 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:49.250
 from this piece the panel was very high 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:51.260
 of instruments maintains the line of 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:53.600
 other models of the brand is not for 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:55.400
 criticize but yes to comment that you can 

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:57.590
 fall something shocking to the aesthetics of 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:59.390
 cabin the fact of using for 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:01.820
 this coupé the same command of 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:03.770
 instruments especially those attached to 

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:06.860
 the address column that leads 

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:08.720
