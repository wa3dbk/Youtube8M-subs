air<00:03:28.980> holes<00:03:29.340> right<00:03:29.580> here<00:03:29.640> and<00:03:30.480> i'm<00:03:30.840> going<00:03:30.989> to<00:03:31.080> do

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:31.799 
air holes right here and i'm going to do

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:33.320 
air holes right here and i'm going to do
this<00:03:31.980> so<00:03:32.160> that<00:03:32.310> way<00:03:32.489> i<00:03:32.519> can<00:03:32.640> see<00:03:33.030> everything

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:33.330 
this so that way i can see everything

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:35.840 
this so that way i can see everything
better<00:03:33.480> it's<00:03:33.840> perfect<00:03:34.260> and<00:03:34.440> then<00:03:35.340> basically

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850 
better it's perfect and then basically

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:37.400 
better it's perfect and then basically
you're<00:03:36.269> going<00:03:36.390> to<00:03:36.450> do<00:03:36.570> is<00:03:36.660> take<00:03:36.840> two<00:03:37.049> pieces<00:03:37.260> of

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
you're going to do is take two pieces of

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:39.170 
you're going to do is take two pieces of
ice<00:03:37.590> and<00:03:37.920> put<00:03:38.100> it<00:03:38.190> on<00:03:38.250> top<00:03:38.280> of<00:03:38.670> each<00:03:38.760> other<00:03:38.940> like

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
ice and put it on top of each other like

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.479 
ice and put it on top of each other like
that<00:03:39.390> break<00:03:40.110> the<00:03:40.350> bottom<00:03:40.769> piece<00:03:41.010> that's<00:03:41.310> on

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:41.489 
that break the bottom piece that's on

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:43.340 
that break the bottom piece that's on
top<00:03:41.640> of<00:03:41.700> another<00:03:42.030> act<00:03:42.329> and<00:03:42.600> place<00:03:43.320> another

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:43.350 
top of another act and place another

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:46.280 
top of another act and place another
rank<00:03:43.890> inside<00:03:44.310> of<00:03:44.459> that<00:03:44.610> and<00:03:44.850> all<00:03:45.690> the<00:03:46.140> way

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
rank inside of that and all the way

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.860 
rank inside of that and all the way
around<00:03:46.850> the<00:03:47.850> holes<00:03:48.090> like<00:03:48.450> you're<00:03:48.660> going<00:03:48.810> to

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
around the holes like you're going to

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:50.390 
around the holes like you're going to
cover<00:03:49.079> the<00:03:49.230> holes<00:03:49.440> by<00:03:49.620> placing<00:03:49.860> it<00:03:50.100> on<00:03:50.160> top<00:03:50.190> of

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
cover the holes by placing it on top of

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.900 
cover the holes by placing it on top of
it<00:03:50.670> not<00:03:50.880> in<00:03:51.120> it<00:03:51.360> but<00:03:51.810> on<00:03:51.989> top<00:03:52.230> of<00:03:52.290> it<00:03:52.730> next<00:03:53.730> thing

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
it not in it but on top of it next thing

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:56.509 
it not in it but on top of it next thing
you<00:03:54.000> do<00:03:54.209> is<00:03:54.239> break<00:03:54.720> every<00:03:55.709> piece<00:03:55.950> another<00:03:56.280> rack

00:03:56.509 --> 00:03:56.519 
you do is break every piece another rack

00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:58.280 
you do is break every piece another rack
so<00:03:57.060> you<00:03:57.120> see<00:03:57.329> there<00:03:57.510> you<00:03:57.630> have<00:03:57.750> that<00:03:57.930> little

air pocket now i'm going to ignite this

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:02.330 
air pocket now i'm going to ignite this
piece<00:04:00.900> of<00:04:01.049> netherrack<00:04:01.470> with<00:04:01.950> this<00:04:02.130> fire

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
piece of netherrack with this fire

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:04.640 
piece of netherrack with this fire
charge<00:04:02.730> and<00:04:03.329> you<00:04:03.360> guys<00:04:04.019> are<00:04:04.230> going<00:04:04.320> to<00:04:04.410> see

but<00:04:10.049> it's<00:04:10.290> going<00:04:10.440> to<00:04:10.500> melt<00:04:10.709> basically<00:04:11.459> it's

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:11.640 
but it's going to melt basically it's

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:13.670 
but it's going to melt basically it's
not<00:04:11.820> going<00:04:11.910> to<00:04:12.030> update<00:04:12.390> the<00:04:12.720> air<00:04:12.900> pocket<00:04:13.590> right

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 
not going to update the air pocket right

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:15.170 
not going to update the air pocket right
there<00:04:13.739> and<00:04:14.100> it's<00:04:14.250> going<00:04:14.400> to<00:04:14.459> stay<00:04:14.519> there<00:04:14.940> until

there and it's going to stay there until
you<00:04:15.390> update<00:04:15.959> it<00:04:15.989> by<00:04:16.260> placing<00:04:16.560> a<00:04:16.769> block<00:04:17.010> around

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:14.000 
building I like doing that format

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.160 
building I like doing that format
building<00:05:14.390> because<00:05:14.540> it<00:05:14.630> just<00:05:14.720> looks<00:05:15.020> really

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:15.170 
building because it just looks really

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:17.410
