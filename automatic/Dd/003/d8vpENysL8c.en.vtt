00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:12.620 
huge leak and well basically Infinity

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:14.319 
huge leak and well basically Infinity
Ward's<00:04:12.950> done<00:04:13.130> it<00:04:13.220> again<00:04:13.430> line<00:04:13.640> after<00:04:14.090> modern

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:14.329 
Ward's done it again line after modern

00:04:14.329 --> 00:04:15.970 
Ward's done it again line after modern
warfare<00:04:14.480> 3<00:04:14.690> I<00:04:14.900> don't<00:04:15.230> I<00:04:15.350> honestly<00:04:15.650> don't<00:04:15.829> think

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:15.980 
warfare 3 I don't I honestly don't think

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:17.949 
warfare 3 I don't I honestly don't think
anyone<00:04:16.669> would<00:04:16.849> have<00:04:16.940> expected<00:04:17.270> a<00:04:17.660> modern

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:17.959 
anyone would have expected a modern

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:22.060 
anyone would have expected a modern
warfare<00:04:18.140> 4<00:04:18.410> but<00:04:19.400> it<00:04:20.209> right<00:04:20.900> with<00:04:21.140> a<00:04:21.470> call<00:04:21.859> from

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:22.070 
warfare 4 but it right with a call from

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:22.580 
warfare 4 but it right with a call from
Bill<00:04:22.280> Moore

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:22.590 
Bill Moore

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:24.710 
Bill Moore
it's<00:04:22.710> basically<00:04:23.130> like<00:04:23.669> straight<00:04:24.270> out<00:04:24.449> of<00:04:24.480> the

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:24.720 
it's basically like straight out of the

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.720 
it's basically like straight out of the
back<00:04:24.900> now<00:04:25.139> I<00:04:25.169> honestly<00:04:25.710> don't<00:04:26.040> think<00:04:26.220> that

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:26.730 
back now I honestly don't think that

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:28.370 
back now I honestly don't think that
we're<00:04:26.910> going<00:04:27.000> to<00:04:27.060> see<00:04:27.300> anything<00:04:27.870> difference

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:28.380 
we're going to see anything difference

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:31.120 
we're going to see anything difference
although<00:04:29.220> with<00:04:29.430> it<00:04:29.520> being<00:04:29.669> leaked<00:04:30.000> so<00:04:30.360> early

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:31.130 
although with it being leaked so early

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:35.200 
although with it being leaked so early
then<00:04:32.130> you<00:04:32.610> know<00:04:32.729> I<00:04:32.760> definitely<00:04:33.330> do<00:04:33.720> think<00:04:34.110> that

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:35.210 
then you know I definitely do think that

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:39.050 
then you know I definitely do think that
activation<00:04:36.210> and<00:04:36.660> infinity<00:04:37.440> ward<00:04:37.669> can<00:04:38.669> like

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:39.060 
activation and infinity ward can like

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:41.090 
activation and infinity ward can like
easily<00:04:39.510> change<00:04:39.810> yourself<00:04:40.169> and<00:04:40.320> they<00:04:40.800> probably

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:41.100 
easily change yourself and they probably

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:43.129 
easily change yourself and they probably
will<00:04:41.610> after<00:04:41.820> this<00:04:42.060> leak<00:04:42.300> now<00:04:42.510> I<00:04:42.540> aren't<00:04:42.960> too

00:04:43.129 --> 00:04:43.139 
will after this leak now I aren't too

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:46.640 
will after this leak now I aren't too
sure<00:04:43.380> but<00:04:44.270> why<00:04:45.270> who<00:04:45.930> knows<00:04:46.110> it's<00:04:46.380> definitely

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:46.650 
sure but why who knows it's definitely

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:49.040 
sure but why who knows it's definitely
still<00:04:47.550> extremely<00:04:47.940> possible<00:04:48.419> so<00:04:48.780> we<00:04:48.810> don't

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:49.050 
still extremely possible so we don't

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:50.360 
still extremely possible so we don't
know<00:04:49.139> how<00:04:49.290> long<00:04:49.350> the<00:04:49.889> games<00:04:50.070> been<00:04:50.220> in

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:50.370 
know how long the games been in

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:52.700 
know how long the games been in
development<00:04:50.520> so<00:04:51.360> they<00:04:52.110> could<00:04:52.290> have<00:04:52.380> already

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:52.710 
development so they could have already

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:54.770 
development so they could have already
done<00:04:52.889> enough<00:04:53.160> to<00:04:53.669> the<00:04:53.790> point<00:04:53.820> where<00:04:54.270> you<00:04:54.690> know

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:54.780 
done enough to the point where you know

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:56.930 
done enough to the point where you know
like<00:04:54.960> they<00:04:55.139> won't<00:04:55.380> change<00:04:55.710> anything<00:04:56.580> over

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:56.940 
like they won't change anything over

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:59.629 
like they won't change anything over
even<00:04:57.270> with<00:04:57.300> the<00:04:57.570> leak<00:04:57.960> but<00:04:58.800> this<00:04:59.520> is

00:04:59.629 --> 00:04:59.639 
even with the leak but this is

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:02.390 
even with the leak but this is
definitely<00:04:59.820> the<00:05:00.180> earliest<00:05:01.080> and<00:05:01.320> biggest<00:05:02.100> news

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:02.400 
definitely the earliest and biggest news

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.900 
definitely the earliest and biggest news
leak<00:05:02.729> we've<00:05:03.090> had<00:05:03.210> for<00:05:03.510> call<00:05:03.810> of<00:05:03.840> duty<00:05:04.320> like<00:05:05.010> all

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:05.910 
leak we've had for call of duty like all

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:07.670 
leak we've had for call of duty like all
together<00:05:06.180> really<00:05:06.600> I<00:05:06.750> don't<00:05:06.990> think<00:05:07.290> this<00:05:07.410> ever

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:07.680 
together really I don't think this ever

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:10.280 
together really I don't think this ever
been<00:05:07.950> one<00:05:08.190> leak<00:05:08.430> Dessie<00:05:08.970> really<00:05:09.240> like<00:05:09.990> it's

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:10.290 
been one leak Dessie really like it's

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:12.909 
been one leak Dessie really like it's
before<00:05:10.860> the<00:05:11.280> previous<00:05:12.030> game<00:05:12.270> anyway

00:05:12.909 --> 00:05:12.919 
before the previous game anyway

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:15.830 
before the previous game anyway
basically<00:05:13.919> like<00:05:14.190> even<00:05:14.880> before<00:05:15.000> black<00:05:15.450> ops<00:05:15.660> 2's

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:15.840 
basically like even before black ops 2's

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:17.690 
basically like even before black ops 2's
out<00:05:16.050> we've<00:05:16.260> got<00:05:16.410> the<00:05:16.530> next<00:05:17.100> call<00:05:17.310> of<00:05:17.340> duty

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:17.700 
out we've got the next call of duty

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:19.670 
out we've got the next call of duty
after<00:05:17.880> that<00:05:18.210> release<00:05:18.479> it<00:05:18.720> like<00:05:18.750> leaks<00:05:19.229> already

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:19.680 
after that release it like leaks already

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:21.590 
after that release it like leaks already
now<00:05:20.430> obviously<00:05:20.639> we<00:05:20.970> don't<00:05:21.090> have<00:05:21.360> any
