00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
looks like so as we look at this unit

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.190 
looks like so as we look at this unit
right<00:01:31.979> here<00:01:32.210> you<00:01:33.210> can<00:01:33.420> see<00:01:33.630> it's<00:01:33.810> a<00:01:33.869> small

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
right here you can see it's a small

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.920 
right here you can see it's a small
circular<00:01:34.500> device<00:01:35.180> it's<00:01:36.180> about<00:01:36.329> six<00:01:36.630> inches

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
circular device it's about six inches

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.399 
circular device it's about six inches
across<00:01:37.909> round<00:01:38.909> the<00:01:39.119> nature<00:01:39.540> it<00:01:39.960> sends<00:01:40.290> out<00:01:40.350> a

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
across round the nature it sends out a

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.370 
across round the nature it sends out a
signal<00:01:40.500> field<00:01:41.009> of<00:01:41.430> anywhere<00:01:41.880> from<00:01:42.150> a<00:01:42.329> foot<00:01:42.659> to

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
signal field of anywhere from a foot to

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.649 
signal field of anywhere from a foot to
about<00:01:43.950> ten<00:01:44.369> feet<00:01:44.729> it's<00:01:45.420> a<00:01:45.689> spear<00:01:46.259> like<00:01:47.659> circle

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
about ten feet it's a spear like circle

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.929 
about ten feet it's a spear like circle
that<00:01:48.780> it<00:01:48.899> sends<00:01:49.229> out<00:01:49.320> so<00:01:49.619> basically<00:01:50.159> you<00:01:50.820> can

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
that it sends out so basically you can

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.260 
that it sends out so basically you can
set<00:01:51.149> that<00:01:51.360> under<00:01:51.570> a<00:01:51.600> couch<00:01:51.930> you<00:01:51.960> can<00:01:52.439> set<00:01:52.740> it

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270 
set that under a couch you can set it

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:55.429 
set that under a couch you can set it
