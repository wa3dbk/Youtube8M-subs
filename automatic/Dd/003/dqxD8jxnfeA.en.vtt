00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.259
 more about the aveve pista gp 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.410
 available at motorcycle clothing center point 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:09.410
 NL 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.719
 motorcycle clothing center the specialist 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.310
 motorcycle clothing 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.810
 8w pista gp is part of it 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.830
 designated tennis project that is one 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.080
 new line from agovv 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.880
 and this is the helmet where errors in rossi 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.910
 currently on the circuit 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.460
 made entirely from carbon and really yes 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:32.700
 so for circuit driving smash that extreme 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.020
 sporty driving this is a very good one 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.520
 him 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.809
 scale techniques all kinds of things that 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.219
 sitting on it are all cities of the 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.219
 doctor really the best of the best 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.980
 Ride a little more on the street and get away 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.059
 between that day you could also possibly 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.789
 could actually turn to the choir 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.170
 that is in terms of scale for the same 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.120
 helmet is only from a luxury cheap 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.280
 scale material made and has 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.079
 for example adjustable ventilation it 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.489
 Well with this helmet everything is done to it 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.140
 keep weight as low as possible 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.989
 also tell you all later 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.239
 a shell is made of carbon fiber 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.650
 you can also see the 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.240
 structure of the scale 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.330
 they have therefore built up the scale and 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.020
 only a clear coat of paint over it 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.670
 sprayed 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.680
 so that you can clearly see that it is him 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:17.100
 completely foo carbon is made 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:19.140
 this print is the print we use 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.180
 every winter test of 2013 has deer 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.710
 is the first time they have him officially 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.049
 on track with released 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:28.560
 you also see all empty cries here 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:30.420
 state where what is the percentage 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.850
 is your one better than its predecessor 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.070
 on different levels 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.259
 weight so about 1350 grams that is 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.549
 quite light for a pre- race and so too 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.479
 very important to you 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.280
 of course you get quite a lot 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.509
 force you up to date on your and so 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.119
 the lighter the helmet 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.619
 the better price is around a thousand euros 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.180
 so a pretty expensive hell but you 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.710
 get a piece a piece for it 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.790
 technology back 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.320
 this help in a different way 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.509
 developed than all other things true 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.700
 you normally first design a scale 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.960
 they first have rossis with him 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.610
 measured head and she is actually 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.380
 from the inside to the outside 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.360
 there is no handling antwerp so first 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.619
 lining around the face when the 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.930
 inner shell and that actually the 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:09.179
 outer shell 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.850
 visor is 4 mm thick with the 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.500
 anti-scratch coating and the pinlock visor 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:15.180
 on the inside and pins also ensures 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.590
 make sure you have an extra oxygen space 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.530
 get in between inside out 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:22.910
 Before hell slower covers 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.910
 very easy to pick you up 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:28.020
 and if you do this you can put it in 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.700
 click through a first lock 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.690
 get care in the top and the 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.920
 bottom 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.050
 a small space that makes it even more 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.850
 extra air around it can go 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.900
 and that 's how it is completely closed 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:38.910
 crash on the three 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.140
 decorating always stays closed when we open it 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:45.720
 do you push the button in 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:46.980
 and he goes so open 17 slim fit 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.209
 this helmet is oval 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.100
 so that means that of the for 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:51.690
 until the back is a bit longer 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:53.820
 and from left to right you get shorter 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:55.590
 will get an extra piece from aveve 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:57.270
 lining with which you what 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:00.239
 what short cannabis you have slightly rounder 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:00.810
 you can adjust the head on this so that 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:03.090
 that what 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:05.250
 which is nice to save weight 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:07.770
 we have this elja no adjustable 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:10.200
 ventilation made but you can also or 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:13.350
 open and to whom these rubber caps 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:15.830
 wonder if you close it and you put it 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:18.870
 you put them back on this rubber cover 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:21.060
 the front ventilation is always open 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:23.489
 and the outlet is also always open when you 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:24.660
 so here the caps fall off 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:27.120
 ventilation comes in here 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:28.709
 and he goes through this job in a track 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.840
 which automatically warm air and the 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:32.250
 backside 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:34.440
 this helmet really stands out 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:36.150
 ventilation super well ventilate him 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.980
 also looks on the inside of hell 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:39.390
 that you have a lot of space or for the 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:41.810
 ventilation so I can maximize 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:41.810
 ventilate 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:51.110
 the inner lining is smoking 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:51.110
 artwork 

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:56.000
 tim flat you can get out 

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:58.790
 and then you see that at the bottom 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.350
 pretty tight around their neck 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:03.110
 cheek pads in the neck roll are on 

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:05.530
 each other and then you can do the with buttons 

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:05.530
 hold off 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:22.680
 most of you pull out what you're here 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:25.380
 see 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:28.530
 this is a concealed cap you can take off 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:30.570
 tighten with Velcro 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:31.800
 I like you so who is going to drive ensures 

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:33.180
 He sure you don't sweat over you 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.960
 he forehead and walk because of this 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:36.390
 is collected 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:38.640
 the entire lining is made of cool max 

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:40.500
 and sweat-draining material also ensures 

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:42.300
 before you sweat less 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:45.120
 and on the inside you see there 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:52.740
 valentino rossi lining 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:53.820
 totally style of rossi and you pull it 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:55.620
 look like this 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:57.030
 music with this lining that they don't have 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:58.230
 few after leaving it over your forehead 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:01.080
 walk or pass your head

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:04.740
 very good fit and even here at the 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:08.550

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:11.760
 adjust the fit the seat cushion 

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:13.170
 in here the out channels through which you too 

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:15.390
 slightly more space on the top 

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:17.460
 to create 

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:18.930
 this can place your signals at the back 

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:20.670
 in the sock 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:22.620
 ensures that you have some short head 

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:26.940

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:29.880
 on the inside you see the grooves and 

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:32.040
 grooves ensure ventilation 

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:32.700
 which comes in at maximum by the helmet 

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:39.360
