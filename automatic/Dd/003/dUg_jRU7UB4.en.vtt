 not primary it can anyone want to attend course 

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:57.670
 we will address ourselves then 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:01.320
 but at the school between German runners reported alone that usually works 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.780
 run representation foreground and everything else 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.440
 stupid only with it but me the most important I see this idea Zieseniß 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.450
 say show the turnaround 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.190
 I was with what he wants with which I organize the whole thing together 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:15.980
 I am at the Gay Games 2000 and 

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:20.730
 2 2 all around it was so good the mood at the eagerness of war 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:23.890
 bombastic and we came home with a lot of emotions impressions 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:27.530
 wanted to do just that in Cologne also on the legs why he has to show 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:30.310
 what the spectators now expect on May weekend for years 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:33.140
 Thankfully, material gets provided to the material 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.310
 Gabriele Scherle Airline agreed to see Franz Galler fries manufacturer 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.670
 So about 30 figure skating know exactly merge 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.320
 of the more than showcases we have everything in the beautiful 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.040
 dark 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.690
 Schmitz with the Spotlight 2 1 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:50.020
 Of course, different people are just theirs 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.970
 the small Hesslein cutouts show 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:56.980
 which different categories with the stars and four categories are available 

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:57.710
 at all 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:02.159
 Photo a on hand I can not say "We have to learn in the top category 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:03.549
 ran 1 percent 

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:04.940
 Show and Individuals 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:06.670
 we have a couple run 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:09.399
 in the fridge and duty fulfillment and splashing 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:13.660
 Animals eaten on Form Open for reassurance and there are various 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.699
 Subcategories services age divided 

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:21.029
 who can do it all so well maybe qualifying or qualifying 

00:02:21.029 --> 00:02:25.269
 one could log on how did the exclusion process happen there 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:28.409
 there is an exclusion process of ice skating you can join the 

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:31.399
 of course, there is a percentage in the association that is the whole mission 

00:02:31.399 --> 00:02:32.519
 regulates 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:34.330
 But fair competition arises 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.890
 In principle, the beginner is just half a year on the ice 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.509
 is up to the but there 73-year-old this year 

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:43.819
 It's back on the ice since childhood 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:46.869
 where do the and various athletes come from? 

00:02:46.869 --> 00:02:48.690
 we represented seven nations 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:53.210
 So far farthest I think the US Army is York for a poor Singapore Russia 

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:56.100
 is also involved but also the European environment France 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.620
 Austria Switzerland Germany, of course, quite a lot 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:03.030
 So an internationally well-filled show event on the weekend in the 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.459
 Kölnarena 2 Moses Alistair Lauderdale at this point sometimes 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:10.369
 Let's say we are giving away place to weather wise twice today 

00:03:10.369 --> 00:03:14.669
 Tickets for the Fabia RS Cup 2009 so if you are there 

00:03:14.669 --> 00:03:15.629
 want to point 

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:18.790
 show-event of the extra class write an e-mail to Sport etched 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:23.010
 Punctuation form with the subject ver di Resta has incoming among all 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.680
 Emails are then raffled and the trains are the winners 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.049
 Of course, Hanser will inform you of your contact details that we 

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:32.239
 he also won the Cardinals inside 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:34.980
 fifth time, this ore Fabolous cap takes place 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:35.790
 what in the so-called 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:38.790
 because the last few years only have bullshit there are the innovations this year 

00:03:40.289 --> 00:03:43.199
 the novelty is that we are not happy that we are with the teams 

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:45.109
 now have a piece at the start 

00:03:45.109 --> 00:03:49.089
 I want to advertise for them quite funny but quite awesome 

00:03:49.089 --> 00:03:52.089
 I'm glad that more and more teams are luring to the start 

00:03:52.589 --> 00:03:55.109
 otherwise we are actually better and better in a well-tried manner 

00:03:55.109 --> 00:03:56.129
 become but 

00:03:56.129 --> 00:03:58.969
 Nintendo now also remained true to tradition 

00:03:58.969 --> 00:04:02.259
 we have now five from Lorch as a cause you can also say that 

00:04:02.259 --> 00:04:03.279
 pleasing Schopp 

00:04:03.279 --> 00:04:06.619
 More and more businesses are gaining more and more popularity year by year 

00:04:06.619 --> 00:04:09.489
 in the case of the runners in any case there has to be increased every year »finds 

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:13.419
 Sugar is not one you started when you think with 36 I know that 

00:04:13.419 --> 00:04:16.810
 Bit by bit, they are getting closer and closer, and the hall feels as if they are walking 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:17.999
 every time 

00:04:17.999 --> 00:04:21.769
 Universe places more on what's a framework program around Dominance never 

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:25.069
 if for the viewers the then also in the Cologne arena 2 now over the the 

00:04:25.069 --> 00:04:26.710
 Mall where alone want to stop by 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:29.720
 So a social program is of course a lot of ice skating is considered open 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:32.370
 up close because the athletes are guessing at the competitions 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:35.590
 of course in a hall and to cheer each other 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:36.889
 there are 

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:40.400
 McQueen joys and sorrows of figure skaters and of course whole 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:42.409
 many colorful costumes on the ice 

00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:46.430
 and one thing even now at the beginning of the program already mentioned 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:50.060
 big events cast their shadows so whatever role plays 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:52.809
 because this year's for - ca also in view 

00:04:52.809 --> 00:04:55.809
 to the Gay Games in the best year here in Cologne 

00:04:56.599 --> 00:04:59.469
 The idea for the film is Kabul at the Gay Games 

00:04:59.469 --> 00:05:01.190
 Founded or is your stand 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:05.060
 and we have in the first capped 2005 also already started or 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:07.650
 Event with regard to the World Cup fails every year 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:08.999
 from 2 5 to now 

00:05:08.999 --> 00:05:12.789
 was really the motto we want to get the area to Cologne because 

00:05:12.789 --> 00:05:15.839
 We have the area in Cologne and the Fed Cup 2010 

00:05:15.839 --> 00:05:19.579
 will be held in Werder against as an event of the area 

00:05:19.579 --> 00:05:22.830
 and that was we are precursors and a bit child of the so 

00:05:22.829 --> 00:05:23.610
 Games Cologne 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:28.659
 so of course the event the conductors deserve the credit from 2010 onwards 

00:05:28.659 --> 00:05:31.539
 next year but also this year will be worth it all over 

00:05:31.539 --> 00:05:32.749
 watch 

00:05:32.749 --> 00:05:34.270

00:05:37.389 --> 00:05:41.430
