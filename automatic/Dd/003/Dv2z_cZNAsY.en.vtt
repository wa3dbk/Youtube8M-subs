00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 but you played for bolivia with a 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:09.780
 equator and had the flag 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:11.130
 euro6 ceraso defender who will play 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.429
 against you 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:16.440
 in that match on Wednesday against 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.539
 Barcelona team as it was in that 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.880
 meeting which strengths you 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.439
 learned and what to put into practice to 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.240
 face these three players again 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.010
 you now with the body of the shirt does not 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:32.040
 with the Bolivian national team jersey 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:33.989
 I think it makes the attack already know 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.110
 form that he plays in the way that 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:39.180
 positioning indicate that players 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.540
 strong or taller than another who plays 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:45.660
 on the right makes it easy to 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.850
 me and I think taking here in a 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.309
 Okay, I like it this time, no. 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.620
 survived but is seeing this confrontation 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.570
 as well as guild's 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.670
 focused on this Barcelona competition as well 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.829
 is betting all the chips was already 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.449
 15 years that does not have a title that is 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.100
 arriving is equal to equal in the fight 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:06.420
 in maximum force 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:10.150
 We also think it's there. 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:12.550
 the same intention as the girl 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:14.800
 it's from a competition who knows how 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:16.770
 we know it's very difficult to face 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:19.060
 with the same seriousness 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.790
 since the beginning of the year we wanted a 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:23.290
 a vacancy and we are 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:26.050
 looking for herself here in the 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:28.180
 South American, what vacancy do you think 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:30.340
 It comes more easily to the league 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:32.020
 Brazilian who is very close 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.640
 the South American who is also not 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:37.840
 It's so difficult so it's far 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:41.590
 less people but we're going to work 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:43.600
 in the same with the same focus as the people 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:45.820
 has been doing 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.770
 the people are cool, job is snake 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:50.140
 in the brazilian championship 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:52.720
 I hope that we can keep this 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:54.850
 same establishment 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:59.310
 in south american 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:59.310
 and so it is 40 but if our goal 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:04.590
 without the zÃ© roberto what changes in the form 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:08.840
 How does the ball reach the forward? 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:11.420
 you roberto 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:14.239
 nobody knows this a good improvement 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:16.459
 new differentiation we know that the 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:18.590
 group is good the team with players 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:21.680
 then waiting for the opportunity to 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:24.200
 to be able to match the beach the guild 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:27.280
 public waterfall that will make it there 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:29.900
 You will miss him it may rain 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.879
 then the thirty-somethings of a child of 11 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:34.670
 years and 158 of the mega-sena 

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:38.540
 so right not sure we know 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:41.540
 who are important players of the group o 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:45.170
 respect that everyone has for him 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:48.019
 we know the quality they have 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:49.099
 man in the field then we expect the 

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:51.140
 players who enter the field will 

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:53.480
 start doing a good job 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.430
 goal away from home is something that 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.379
 person perceives as always in this type of 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:59.180
 competition which is the way you 

00:02:57.379 --> 00:03:00.560
 from barcelona that can be 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:03.500
 explored by the rain in that game of 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:07.030
 last week against the copper 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:11.769
 We know it's a team here. 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:14.959
 in the house is a strong team a team 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:18.600
 that if you give space they go to 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:21.180
 Up and make a goal we have to 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:23.580
 maintain the balance all the way to the 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.080
 ball possession and if you have the opportunity 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:27.210
 to make the goal 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:29.520
 sure take advantage because in this 

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:30.990
 In this competition it is very important that you 

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:33.630
 found lawn conditions too 

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:35.640
 admirer of the mentions and complained 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:39.090
 little of the ball show jokes 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:41.459
 It seems a little bigger for me than I am. 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:45.990
 I'd rather talk about this game and now that 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:48.030
 It happened to me, I'd rather not comment. 

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:50.220
 You said that this stage is 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:52.410
 her tongue to play, hoping that 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:54.650
 advance the team can come out with a good 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:54.650
 result
