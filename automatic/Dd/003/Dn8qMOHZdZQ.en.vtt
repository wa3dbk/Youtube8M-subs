 they received a greater reception from the public 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:06.970
 they were first contact in 1996 and the 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:06.970
 first tape released in 1979 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:15.630

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.580
 appearance of the is unoriginal and the

 became the actor who has participated 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:33.680
 in more 'star trek' movies 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:42.030
 and you knew that 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:44.340
 at first the director jay jay 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.380
 abrams thought about summoning william 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.110
 shatner so he had a brief but 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.440
 important role in this movie such as 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.490
 was made with leonard nimoy 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:56.730
 unfortunately in the end 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:59.520
 abrams desisted from this idea notwithstanding 

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:01.830
 it is said that good knowledge could be left 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:07.610

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:07.610
 aucat chances or maybe you knew that 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.380
 it has been calculated that if in real life 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:16.209
 would like to build and equip 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:19.150
 completely the enterprise ship that 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:21.760
 we see in this film the budget without 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:27.340
 include labor would amount to more 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:30.010
 of 468,000 million dollars that is 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:36.670
 more than the total budget of many 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:38.680

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:42.840
