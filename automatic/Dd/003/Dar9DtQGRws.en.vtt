00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:16.610 
better then you start making your

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:19.180 
better then you start making your
changes<00:07:16.940> then<00:07:17.420> the<00:07:18.080> whole<00:07:18.290> shots<00:07:18.590> everything

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:19.190 
changes then the whole shots everything

00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:30.100 
changes then the whole shots everything
if<00:07:19.820> you<00:07:20.030> can<00:07:20.240> get<00:07:20.450> it

00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:30.110 

00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:32.680 

you<00:07:30.230> can't<00:07:30.530> get<00:07:30.800> it<00:07:30.980> then<00:07:31.670> you<00:07:31.880> just<00:07:32.090> you<00:07:32.570> know

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:32.690 
you can't get it then you just you know

00:07:32.690 --> 00:07:35.560 
you can't get it then you just you know
you<00:07:33.020> kind<00:07:33.260> of<00:07:33.320> pull<00:07:33.530> out<00:07:34.060> what's<00:07:35.060> the<00:07:35.300> first

00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:35.570
