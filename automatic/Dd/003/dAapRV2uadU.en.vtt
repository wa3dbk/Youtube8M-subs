00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:05.879
 Hello New Year this year 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.290
 the holidays inspired me a lot of ideas for 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:09.510
 holiday manicure 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:12.540
 one such idea I am with you now 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.309
 share at the heart of this manicure lies 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.220
 usual french manicure 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:20.270
 which I decided to turn into smart 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.260
 element of any New Year's image 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:26.039
 manicure always start with applying 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:29.390
 basics i have this base dad stuck with 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.390
 calcium and vitamin b 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:48.350
 the next stage is a set of year draws for 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:51.290
 french manicure in shade 04 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:54.020
 The set includes white and soft pink lacquer 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:57.500
 as well as the ribbons I prefer 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:59.540
 do not use but wear only one layer 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:02.180
 pink varnish is enough 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:04.900
 to align the color of the entire nail 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:04.900
 plates 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.890
 the hardest part is staining 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.380
 white nail polish 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.899
 I always rely on my accuracy and 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.829
 I draw stripes by hand for those who do not 

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:22.679
 wants to risk 

00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:25.909
 I have ready-made strips personally with them 

00:01:22.679 --> 00:01:25.909
 always spoil the manicure 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:52.570
 red varnish and symbol tenge forever I do not 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:54.820
 I draw a hat of Santa Claus 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:57.420
 it's best to do it fine 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:57.420
 tassel 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:26.840
 going back to the white varnish i will 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:29.209
 draw a white pompom on a bob hat 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:31.580
 does not have to be even 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:38.780
 would be more realistic if the edges do 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:41.090
 a little fluffy all the same white varnish 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:44.150
 I fill the empty space with snowflakes 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:46.819
 here you can not try and draw 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:50.170
 curly smooth snowflakes and the most simple 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:50.170
 will look elegant 

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:32.060
 the final touch will be small 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:34.770
 straziki in the heart of the snowflake card 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:38.040
 the most convenient way is to type lightly 

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:42.380
 wet cotton swab she already 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:42.380
 and press them still dry varnish 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:03.920
 we fix the manicure then the clouds or ready 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:23.000
 congratulations to all happy new year 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:25.750

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:29.949
