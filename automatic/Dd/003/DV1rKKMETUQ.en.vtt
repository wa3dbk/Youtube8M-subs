00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.910
 hello girls 

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:18.580
 jaja wanted to know like mine like me 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:19.960
 My nails were made because they have 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:22.180
 I hope you enjoy the line 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:28.000
 I hope she sees quite well 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:30.430
 it's a totally easy way and 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.129
 I do it quite like I'm driving 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:34.809
 like yourself because left and right 

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:39.040
 Actually, you do it yourself totally 

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:42.670
 around biscuit and that are similar to that 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:47.530
 it's totally easy I have mine 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:51.699
 nails made with samuel and with 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:55.440
 That's why the bus becomes big opal 

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:57.850
 then a nice big milky tone 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.559
 and yes because I now immediately 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:00.220
 I'm a stranger to make up 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:02.650
 that made 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:06.130
 The color I have on it is also from 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:07.630
 samuel and brilliant though you can 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:10.150
 but actually with every color 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:14.440
 make has so schima always indoors 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:16.300
 he a kita many are not all for it 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.790
 suitable but with so shimmer and is it 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:22.600
 this brilliant glasses series from 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:24.280
 of samuels has got to be really really 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:29.110
 inside with which we really great 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:35.200
 We need our finished needle years 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:37.060
 of age and a tip scourers I 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.880
 urge maybe next to it also 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:41.980
 the lid edge if the spd on it 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:51.270
 with the sponge takes a bit 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:57.820
 I am color and then from below 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:02:05.570
 to top it up a relatively long bomb to more 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:10.250
 color fragrant simply on 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:12.260
 going upwards then if you 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.670
 the lower part she has namely the 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:17.240
 other side of the sponge the the 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.680
 clean and therefore tried 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:24.440
 that's a bit more of the transition 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:35.000
 just keep it up so that's it 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:38.260
 long so shocked is okay it is 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:41.060
 totally easy with every song genie 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:43.790
 smuggling with with this this this 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:46.850
 pool colors so probably a color is with 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:48.350
 glittering it is not so beautiful 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:50.300
 honestly time what you should already 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:54.709
 in China or in gc use for it 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:57.140
 I use for my nails from the building 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:03:04.160
 ago always samuel cellar because I 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:05.300
 personally I once negotiated 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.530
 I have quite good things about it 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:09.650
 Let's do it a second time 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:12.230
 it really does not 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:13.880
 is transparent or so so still 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:20.420
 times from the bottom, then it really 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:24.739
 very close is yes and from the other side 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:28.610
 Once again, that's so little 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:29.870
 Of course, washing is the same for everyone 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:31.160
 much faster if you can do that too 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:37.400
 one through makes a total 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:40.610
 fast studio nevada and looks good 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:44.799
 out and is totally totally done quickly 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:51.160
 and have now noticed their 

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:53.360
 I like to be fast and easy 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.769
 I again on my nails 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:56.690
 the pointed, it is also very good and is 

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:59.239
 So you see your right hand is you 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:03.019
 not so easy was the movement 

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:05.700
 dyslexic the right one is for me completely 

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:13.230
 well done and just with samuel l 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:15.500
 model three alpacas that whatever 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:20.700
 everything is rosy 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:24.030
 I always have that idea thickest 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:26.900
 I think I am and I am also from 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:29.370
 These are very satisfied 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:31.080
 that looks like now and if I do 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:33.510
 now give the insured it is 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:36.680
 then you see how it is then in the 

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:36.680
 looks real life 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:50.990
 and me totally fast and easy 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:52.610
 We're fine with one 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:55.450
 jack and glitter is inside 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:05:00.320
 In this case I have glasses corel 

00:04:55.450 --> 00:05:04.330
 choral of thumbnails on used so 

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:04.330
