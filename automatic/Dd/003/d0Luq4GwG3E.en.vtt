00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:41.440 
very similar to how the tf2 trading

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.290 
very similar to how the tf2 trading
system<00:00:41.739> works<00:00:41.949> if<00:00:42.280> anyone's<00:00:42.579> familiar<00:00:42.940> with

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:43.300 
system works if anyone's familiar with

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:45.209 
system works if anyone's familiar with
that<00:00:43.329> so<00:00:44.230> it's<00:00:44.319> a<00:00:44.350> lot<00:00:44.440> safer<00:00:44.620> than<00:00:44.949> just

00:00:45.209 --> 00:00:45.219 
that so it's a lot safer than just

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:46.950 
that so it's a lot safer than just
throwing<00:00:45.280> items<00:00:45.550> on<00:00:45.789> the<00:00:45.850> ground<00:00:46.030> indeed<00:00:46.629> so

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:46.960 
throwing items on the ground indeed so

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:48.689 
throwing items on the ground indeed so
let's<00:00:47.589> just<00:00:47.800> go<00:00:47.920> over<00:00:47.979> the<00:00:48.100> commands<00:00:48.339> whicli

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380 
successful so I wouldn't advise doing

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:48.810 
successful so I wouldn't advise doing
this<00:02:47.590> because<00:02:47.770> they<00:02:48.100> could<00:02:48.280> remove<00:02:48.520> all<00:02:48.730> the

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:48.820 
this because they could remove all the

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:51.210 
this because they could remove all the

best<00:02:51.430> but<00:02:52.260> it's<00:02:53.260> not<00:02:53.440> good<00:02:53.710> isn't<00:02:53.920> the<00:02:53.980> reason

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
best but it's not good isn't the reason

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:55.680
