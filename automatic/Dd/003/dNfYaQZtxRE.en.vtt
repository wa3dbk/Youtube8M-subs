00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.969 

thing<00:00:00.269> and<00:00:00.570> again<00:00:01.079> all<00:00:01.469> you're<00:00:01.680> doing<00:00:01.709> is

00:00:01.969 --> 00:00:01.979 
thing and again all you're doing is

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:03.260 
thing and again all you're doing is
placing<00:00:02.190> your<00:00:02.429> patterns<00:00:02.760> in<00:00:02.879> the<00:00:02.909> proper

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:03.270 
placing your patterns in the proper

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:05.630 
placing your patterns in the proper
position<00:00:03.419> and<00:00:03.959> that<00:00:04.500> basically<00:00:04.710> helps<00:00:05.190> and<00:00:05.490> I

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:05.640 
position and that basically helps and I

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.240 
position and that basically helps and I
only<00:00:05.790> have<00:00:05.940> two<00:00:06.150> pylons<00:00:06.480> used<00:00:07.350> to<00:00:07.859> make<00:00:08.040> my

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250 
only have two pylons used to make my

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.820 
only have two pylons used to make my
other<00:00:08.490> gateways<00:00:08.790> and<00:00:09.150> such<00:00:09.420> and<00:00:09.800> every<00:00:10.800> other

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
other gateways and such and every other

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.950 
other gateways and such and every other
python<00:00:11.280> is<00:00:11.400> basically<00:00:11.700> used<00:00:11.880> to<00:00:12.059> get<00:00:12.330> vision

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
python is basically used to get vision

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.379 
python is basically used to get vision
on<00:00:13.139> the<00:00:13.170> map<00:00:13.620> and<00:00:13.969> again<00:00:14.969> just<00:00:15.120> creating

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
on the map and again just creating

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.380 
on the map and again just creating
massive<00:00:15.599> dragoons<00:00:16.109> right<00:00:16.440> now<00:00:16.590> nothing<00:00:17.039> big

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:17.390 
massive dragoons right now nothing big

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:21.260 
massive dragoons right now nothing big
what<00:00:18.390> else<00:00:18.890> also<00:00:19.890> okay<00:00:20.250> yeah<00:00:20.460> the<00:00:20.670> reason<00:00:21.210> I

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
what else also okay yeah the reason I

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.240 
what else also okay yeah the reason I
career<00:00:21.570> is<00:00:21.689> is<00:00:21.840> because<00:00:21.960> when<00:00:22.650> you<00:00:22.769> expand<00:00:23.160> you

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
career is is because when you expand you

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:24.529 
career is is because when you expand you
can<00:00:23.369> basically<00:00:23.550> have<00:00:23.730> your<00:00:23.970> viewers<00:00:24.269> and

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
can basically have your viewers and

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.300 
can basically have your viewers and
you're<00:00:24.750> behind<00:00:25.320> you<00:00:25.500> two<00:00:25.650> goons<00:00:25.890> in<00:00:25.980> a<00:00:26.099> line

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
you're behind you two goons in a line

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.670 
you're behind you two goons in a line
and<00:00:26.550> if<00:00:27.359> they<00:00:27.480> try<00:00:27.630> to<00:00:27.689> attack<00:00:28.019> they'll<00:00:28.500> get

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
and if they try to attack they'll get

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:29.810 
and if they try to attack they'll get
off<00:00:28.769> the<00:00:28.920> if<00:00:29.099> they<00:00:29.250> want<00:00:29.460> to<00:00:29.490> go<00:00:29.580> for<00:00:29.730> your

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
off the if they want to go for your

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:30.769 
off the if they want to go for your
rebirth<00:00:30.090> they're<00:00:30.179> going<00:00:30.300> to<00:00:30.359> lose<00:00:30.449> all<00:00:30.630> their

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
rebirth they're going to lose all their

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.080 
rebirth they're going to lose all their
units<00:00:31.080> by<00:00:31.230> arrogance<00:00:31.890> and<00:00:32.369> if<00:00:32.759> they<00:00:32.910> want<00:00:33.059> to

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
units by arrogance and if they want to

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.490 
units by arrogance and if they want to
go<00:00:33.149> for<00:00:33.329> you<00:00:33.420> to<00:00:33.540> go<00:00:33.660> into<00:00:33.840> your<00:00:33.930> reversal<00:00:34.380> do<00:00:34.469> a

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
go for you to go into your reversal do a

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:35.930 
go for you to go into your reversal do a
lot<00:00:34.710> of<00:00:34.739> damage<00:00:34.950> so<00:00:35.280> it's<00:00:35.399> basically<00:00:35.579> like<00:00:35.880> a

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
lot of damage so it's basically like a

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.000 
lot of damage so it's basically like a
win-win<00:00:36.210> situation<00:00:36.500> I'll<00:00:37.500> show<00:00:37.710> you<00:00:37.770> guys<00:00:37.950> how

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
that works too when I get my first

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.510 
that works too when I get my first
through<00:00:39.600> result<00:00:40.050> and<00:00:40.260> if<00:00:40.860> my<00:00:41.070> harassment

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
through result and if my harassment

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:42.619 
through result and if my harassment
doesn't<00:00:41.760> work<00:00:41.850> properly<00:00:42.000> i'm<00:00:42.390> going<00:00:42.570> to

show you guys how to basically line up
your<00:00:50.190> room<00:00:50.399> dragoons<00:00:50.850> and<00:00:51.210> then<00:00:51.390> your<00:00:51.539> ears

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
your room dragoons and then your ears

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.840 
your room dragoons and then your ears
behind<00:00:51.960> them<00:00:52.289> to<00:00:52.500> secure<00:00:53.219> expansion

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
behind them to secure expansion

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.970 
behind them to secure expansion
Christmas<00:00:54.210> and<00:00:54.510> again<00:00:55.170> I<00:00:55.199> know<00:00:55.350> I<00:00:55.440> said<00:00:55.710> in<00:00:55.829> one

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
Christmas and again I know I said in one

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.069 
Christmas and again I know I said in one
of<00:00:56.010> my<00:00:56.129> other<00:00:56.160> videos<00:00:56.370> where<00:00:56.879> if<00:00:57.300> you<00:00:57.750> expand

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
of my other videos where if you expand

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.389 
of my other videos where if you expand
your<00:00:58.170> going<00:00:58.350> to<00:00:58.410> lose<00:00:58.590> but<00:00:58.859> that's<00:00:59.129> only<00:00:59.280> if

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
your going to lose but that's only if

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.060 
your going to lose but that's only if
you<00:00:59.629> expand<00:01:00.629> without<00:01:00.809> like<00:01:01.230> a<00:01:01.410> tech<00:01:01.739> unit

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
you expand without like a tech unit

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.939 
you expand without like a tech unit
after<00:01:02.280> um<00:01:03.080> dragoons<00:01:04.080> like<00:01:04.619> if<00:01:04.739> you<00:01:04.860> have

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
after um dragoons like if you have

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.950 
after um dragoons like if you have
Templars<00:01:05.400> then<00:01:05.670> expansion<00:01:06.240> also<00:01:06.390> works<00:01:06.720> if

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
Templars then expansion also works if

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.830 
Templars then expansion also works if
you<00:01:07.080> have<00:01:07.229> Reavers<00:01:07.619> expansion<00:01:08.100> also<00:01:08.250> works<00:01:08.840> if

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
you have Reavers expansion also works if

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.770 
you have Reavers expansion also works if
you<00:01:09.960> have<00:01:10.080> carriers<00:01:10.500> it<00:01:10.680> also<00:01:10.950> works<00:01:11.100> but<00:01:11.400> like

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:11.780 
you have carriers it also works but like

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.780 
you have carriers it also works but like
that's<00:01:12.780> not<00:01:13.020> go<00:01:13.439> there<00:01:13.650> because<00:01:13.860> you<00:01:14.369> got<00:01:14.490> you

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
that's not go there because you got you

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.190 
that's not go there because you got you
gotta<00:01:14.939> be<00:01:15.060> real<00:01:15.210> moved<00:01:15.420> to<00:01:15.540> go<00:01:15.630> carriers<00:01:16.049> with

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
gotta be real moved to go carriers with

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.289 
gotta be real moved to go carriers with
one<00:01:16.470> base<00:01:16.680> unless<00:01:17.009> there's<00:01:17.820> probably<00:01:18.090> like

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
one base unless there's probably like

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:19.640 
one base unless there's probably like
one<00:01:18.540> or<00:01:18.659> two<00:01:18.720> strategies<00:01:19.140> where<00:01:19.380> you<00:01:19.470> actually

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
one or two strategies where you actually

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.499 
one or two strategies where you actually
can<00:01:20.009> go<00:01:20.189> one<00:01:20.340> based<00:01:20.520> carriers<00:01:20.880> except<00:01:21.240> I<00:01:21.450> don't

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
can go one based carriers except I don't

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:22.789 
can go one based carriers except I don't
know<00:01:21.659> what<00:01:21.780> the<00:01:21.990> that<00:01:22.049> is<00:01:22.229> and<00:01:22.650> I'm<00:01:22.740> not

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
know what the that is and I'm not

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:23.990 
know what the that is and I'm not
going<00:01:23.070> to<00:01:23.130> try<00:01:23.220> to<00:01:23.280> explain<00:01:23.580> that<00:01:23.759> because<00:01:23.850> I

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
going to try to explain that because I

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.969 
going to try to explain that because I
don't<00:01:24.150> even<00:01:24.240> know<00:01:24.420> myself<00:01:24.570> and<00:01:25.560> I<00:01:25.680> got<00:01:25.830> my<00:01:25.920> to

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
don't even know myself and I got my to

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.230 
don't even know myself and I got my to
reverse<00:01:26.340> so<00:01:26.460> I'm<00:01:26.549> going<00:01:26.670> to<00:01:26.700> go<00:01:26.820> out<00:01:26.850> here<00:01:26.970> and

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
reverse so I'm going to go out here and

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.450 
reverse so I'm going to go out here and
I'm<00:01:27.810> gonna<00:01:27.960> just<00:01:28.140> basically<00:01:28.470> here's<00:01:29.340> your

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
up to quincy really smart because it's

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.370 
up to quincy really smart because it's
basically<00:02:02.820> like<00:02:03.090> a<00:02:03.149> line<00:02:03.390> of<00:02:03.540> cannons<00:02:03.899> they

basically like a line of cannons they
all<00:02:04.530> attack<00:02:04.860> at<00:02:04.890> once<00:02:05.070> and<00:02:05.520> for<00:02:05.820> autonomy<00:02:06.270> to

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
all attack at once and for autonomy to

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:09.020 
all attack at once and for autonomy to
have<00:02:06.600> his<00:02:06.810> dragoons<00:02:07.140> like<00:02:08.129> this<00:02:08.399> the<00:02:08.789> enemy

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
have his dragoons like this the enemy

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.520 
have his dragoons like this the enemy
will<00:02:09.239> have<00:02:09.360> to<00:02:09.479> like<00:02:09.629> make<00:02:09.810> dragoons<00:02:10.259> go<00:02:10.440> on

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
will have to like make dragoons go on

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:11.990 
will have to like make dragoons go on
top<00:02:10.679> of<00:02:10.800> each<00:02:10.860> other<00:02:11.009> like<00:02:11.220> if<00:02:11.340> they<00:02:11.459> man<00:02:11.879> you

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
top of each other like if they man you

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.670 
top of each other like if they man you
automatically<00:02:12.750> attack<00:02:13.110> with<00:02:13.290> like

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
automatically attack with like

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.250 
automatically attack with like
okay<00:02:14.310> attack<00:02:15.000> move<00:02:15.359> and<00:02:15.629> then<00:02:15.750> that<00:02:15.989> basically

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
okay attack move and then that basically

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.500 
okay attack move and then that basically
means<00:02:16.560> that<00:02:16.680> they're<00:02:17.640> all<00:02:17.909> their<00:02:18.180> degrees

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
means that they're all their degrees

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.000 
means that they're all their degrees
will<00:02:18.659> have<00:02:18.750> to<00:02:18.930> spread<00:02:19.709> out<00:02:19.890> like

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
will have to spread out like

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:21.229 
will have to spread out like
automatically<00:02:20.609> which<00:02:20.790> will<00:02:20.909> take<00:02:21.030> a<00:02:21.060> lot

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239 
automatically which will take a lot

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:23.059 
automatically which will take a lot
longer<00:02:21.480> and<00:02:21.719> that<00:02:22.230> basically<00:02:22.500> means<00:02:22.920> that

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:23.069 
longer and that basically means that

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:26.539 
longer and that basically means that
he's<00:02:24.060> not<00:02:24.239> going<00:02:24.390> to<00:02:24.420> be<00:02:24.480> able<00:02:24.569> to<00:02:26.400> would

right now and if you're going to load up
truck<00:02:37.170> owners<00:02:37.379> you<00:02:37.530> shouldn't<00:02:37.799> do<00:02:37.889> this<00:02:38.040> you

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:55.789 
shuttle dies i'm really right now
because<00:02:53.310> I<00:02:53.609> just<00:02:54.510> can't<00:02:54.750> possibly<00:02:55.260> win<00:02:55.470> with

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:55.799 
because I just can't possibly win with

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:57.379 
because I just can't possibly win with
my<00:02:55.950> shuttle<00:02:56.250> death<00:02:56.609> because<00:02:57.030> shuttles

00:02:57.379 --> 00:02:57.389 
my shuttle death because shuttles

00:02:57.389 --> 00:02:58.520 
my shuttle death because shuttles
basically<00:02:57.720> the<00:02:57.810> main<00:02:57.959> thing<00:02:58.169> that's<00:02:58.349> keeping

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
basically the main thing that's keeping

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.679 
basically the main thing that's keeping
me<00:02:58.709> alive<00:02:58.859> here<00:02:59.250> and<00:02:59.430> again<00:03:00.150> just<00:03:00.299> dropping

00:03:00.679 --> 00:03:00.689 
me alive here and again just dropping

00:03:00.689 --> 00:03:02.509 
me alive here and again just dropping
here<00:03:00.870> just<00:03:01.109> because<00:03:01.230> i<00:03:01.709> think<00:03:01.769> i<00:03:02.189> have<00:03:02.219> good

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:02.519 
here just because i think i have good

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:05.209 
here just because i think i have good
enough<00:03:02.700> shadow<00:03:02.939> micro<00:03:03.329> to<00:03:03.569> make<00:03:04.379> do<00:03:04.950> a<00:03:04.980> lot<00:03:05.189> of

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:05.219 
enough shadow micro to make do a lot of

00:03:05.219 --> 00:03:07.190 
enough shadow micro to make do a lot of
damage<00:03:05.489> and<00:03:05.819> lose<00:03:06.180> like<00:03:06.450> maybe<00:03:06.689> when<00:03:06.930> we<00:03:07.079> were

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
damage and lose like maybe when we were

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.830 
damage and lose like maybe when we were
at<00:03:07.260> the<00:03:07.379> max<00:03:07.620> and<00:03:08.090> again<00:03:09.090> not<00:03:09.389> this<00:03:09.569> not<00:03:09.719> how

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
at the max and again not this not how

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.449 
at the max and again not this not how
you<00:03:09.900> should<00:03:10.019> micro<00:03:10.409> and<00:03:10.650> I<00:03:10.799> lost<00:03:11.010> this<00:03:11.159> we<00:03:11.340> were

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
you should micro and I lost this we were

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:14.149 
you should micro and I lost this we were
but<00:03:11.639> whatever<00:03:11.909> I<00:03:12.319> at<00:03:13.319> least<00:03:13.439> saved<00:03:13.680> one<00:03:13.889> never

00:03:14.149 --> 00:03:14.159 
but whatever I at least saved one never

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:16.159 
but whatever I at least saved one never
better<00:03:14.489> something<00:03:14.760> than<00:03:14.909> nothing<00:03:15.060> and<00:03:15.659> this

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:16.169 
better something than nothing and this

00:03:16.169 --> 00:03:17.809 
better something than nothing and this
we<00:03:16.319> were<00:03:16.439> saved<00:03:16.709> and<00:03:16.950> he<00:03:17.129> has<00:03:17.219> a<00:03:17.250> bit<00:03:17.459> of<00:03:17.549> units

00:03:17.809 --> 00:03:17.819 
we were saved and he has a bit of units

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:19.490 
we were saved and he has a bit of units
and<00:03:18.060> I've<00:03:18.209> got<00:03:18.419> an<00:03:18.510> expansion<00:03:18.930> of<00:03:19.019> so<00:03:19.199> I<00:03:19.229> guess

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
and I've got an expansion of so I guess

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.259 
and I've got an expansion of so I guess
he<00:03:20.159> probably<00:03:20.310> does<00:03:20.579> not<00:03:20.729> an<00:03:20.790> expansion<00:03:21.180> up

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:21.269 
he probably does not an expansion up

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:22.939 
he probably does not an expansion up
also<00:03:21.629> but<00:03:21.870> if<00:03:21.989> he<00:03:22.139> does<00:03:22.319> and<00:03:22.530> I'm<00:03:22.620> if<00:03:22.799> his

00:03:22.939 --> 00:03:22.949 
also but if he does and I'm if his

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:24.979 
also but if he does and I'm if his
expansion<00:03:23.280> is<00:03:23.430> before<00:03:23.760> mine<00:03:23.970> then<00:03:24.690> I'm<00:03:24.870> gonna

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:24.989 
expansion is before mine then I'm gonna

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:26.809 
expansion is before mine then I'm gonna
know<00:03:25.169> he<00:03:25.349> doesn't<00:03:25.560> have<00:03:25.799> he's<00:03:26.310> not<00:03:26.430> going<00:03:26.639> for

00:03:26.809 --> 00:03:26.819 
know he doesn't have he's not going for

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:28.250 
know he doesn't have he's not going for
we<00:03:26.909> will<00:03:27.060> drop<00:03:27.239> and<00:03:27.510> I'm<00:03:27.629> gonna<00:03:27.750> know<00:03:27.930> he<00:03:28.109> does

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
we will drop and I'm gonna know he does

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.409 
we will drop and I'm gonna know he does
it<00:03:28.500> sorry<00:03:29.280> then<00:03:29.549> I'm<00:03:29.639> gonna<00:03:29.729> also<00:03:29.909> know<00:03:30.180> that<00:03:30.209> I

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:30.419 
it sorry then I'm gonna also know that I

00:03:30.419 --> 00:03:31.939 
it sorry then I'm gonna also know that I
can<00:03:30.540> harass<00:03:30.780> him<00:03:30.989> because<00:03:31.319> I<00:03:31.349> mean<00:03:31.560> I<00:03:31.650> have<00:03:31.919> a

00:03:31.939 --> 00:03:31.949 
can harass him because I mean I have a

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:33.619 
can harass him because I mean I have a
bigger<00:03:32.189> unit<00:03:32.609> continent<00:03:33.239> because<00:03:33.299> I've<00:03:33.599> been

00:03:33.619 --> 00:03:33.629 
bigger unit continent because I've been

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:35.210 
bigger unit continent because I've been
pumping<00:03:34.079> from<00:03:34.199> three<00:03:34.439> gateways<00:03:34.769> longer<00:03:35.069> than

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
pumping from three gateways longer than

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.640 
pumping from three gateways longer than
he<00:03:35.370> has<00:03:35.400> and<00:03:35.760> my<00:03:36.750> expansions<00:03:37.199> up<00:03:37.349> but<00:03:37.530> it's

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
he has and my expansions up but it's

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:38.960 
he has and my expansions up but it's
later<00:03:37.829> than<00:03:37.889> his<00:03:38.189> so<00:03:38.310> that<00:03:38.459> means<00:03:38.669> I've<00:03:38.849> been

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
later than his so that means I've been

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:40.759 
later than his so that means I've been
pumping<00:03:39.269> more<00:03:39.389> than<00:03:39.569> he<00:03:39.750> has<00:03:39.870> again<00:03:40.229> and<00:03:40.530> so

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:40.769 
pumping more than he has again and so

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:42.589 
pumping more than he has again and so
that's<00:03:41.010> basically<00:03:41.129> means<00:03:41.549> that<00:03:41.639> I<00:03:42.000> can<00:03:42.479> we

00:03:42.589 --> 00:03:42.599 
that's basically means that I can we

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:44.390 
that's basically means that I can we
were<00:03:42.750> asked<00:03:43.139> him<00:03:43.229> and<00:03:43.439> that'll<00:03:43.889> screw<00:03:44.099> him<00:03:44.250> up

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
were asked him and that'll screw him up

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.460 
were asked him and that'll screw him up
I'll<00:03:45.389> go<00:03:45.569> away<00:03:45.750> from<00:03:45.930> my<00:03:45.989> second<00:03:46.290> river

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
I'll go away from my second river

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:49.879 
I'll go away from my second river
because<00:03:46.739> two<00:03:46.889> rivers<00:03:47.720> can<00:03:48.720> if<00:03:49.169> we<00:03:49.500> like<00:03:49.709> to

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:49.889 
because two rivers can if we like to

00:03:49.889 --> 00:03:51.110 
because two rivers can if we like to
that<00:03:50.069> basically<00:03:50.310> two<00:03:50.519> squares<00:03:50.849> in<00:03:51.030> the

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
that basically two squares in the

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.270 
that basically two squares in the
mineral<00:03:51.629> line<00:03:51.930> before<00:03:52.530> your<00:03:52.889> opponent<00:03:53.069> has

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
mineral line before your opponent has

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.030 
mineral line before your opponent has
enough<00:03:53.669> we<00:03:54.209> retaliate<00:03:55.169> in<00:03:55.349> time<00:03:55.530> to<00:03:55.680> retreat

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
enough we retaliate in time to retreat

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.009 
enough we retaliate in time to retreat
and<00:03:56.129> that<00:03:56.879> basically<00:03:57.120> means<00:03:57.479> you<00:03:57.629> get<00:03:57.720> a<00:03:57.780> lot

00:03:58.009 --> 00:03:58.019 
and that basically means you get a lot

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:00.349 
and that basically means you get a lot
to<00:03:58.680> two<00:03:59.220> squares<00:03:59.489> can<00:03:59.729> basically<00:03:59.909> take<00:04:00.090> out

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:00.359 
to two squares can basically take out

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:02.300 
to two squares can basically take out
the<00:04:00.479> whole<00:04:00.599> probe<00:04:00.930> line<00:04:01.139> if<00:04:01.349> they're<00:04:01.560> targeted

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310 
the whole probe line if they're targeted

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:05.119 
the whole probe line if they're targeted
or<00:04:02.579> if<00:04:02.699> they're<00:04:02.849> just<00:04:02.879> lucky<00:04:03.359> and<00:04:03.949> I'm<00:04:04.949> going

00:04:05.119 --> 00:04:05.129 
or if they're just lucky and I'm going

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:08.030 
or if they're just lucky and I'm going
to<00:04:05.189> go<00:04:05.280> drop<00:04:05.970> him<00:04:06.209> now<00:04:06.359> because<00:04:06.599> I<00:04:07.470> don't<00:04:08.009> think

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
to go drop him now because I don't think

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.589 
to go drop him now because I don't think
he<00:04:08.220> can<00:04:08.340> hold<00:04:08.489> this<00:04:08.669> I<00:04:08.909> doubt<00:04:09.180> he<00:04:09.329> can<00:04:09.449> hold

00:04:09.589 --> 00:04:09.599 
he can hold this I doubt he can hold

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:11.300 
he can hold this I doubt he can hold
this<00:04:09.750> and<00:04:10.470> he<00:04:10.590> just<00:04:10.769> now<00:04:10.859> he<00:04:10.919> doesn't<00:04:11.220> even

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
this and he just now he doesn't even

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:13.849 
this and he just now he doesn't even
have<00:04:11.519> her<00:04:11.609> over<00:04:11.909> robotics<00:04:12.900> observer<00:04:13.409> now<00:04:13.799> the

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:13.859 
have her over robotics observer now the

00:04:13.859 --> 00:04:15.349 
have her over robotics observer now the
thing<00:04:14.189> with<00:04:14.340> the<00:04:14.370> hit<00:04:14.669> thing<00:04:14.879> with<00:04:15.000> a<00:04:15.120> strategy

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:15.359 
thing with the hit thing with a strategy

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:17.539 
thing with the hit thing with a strategy
is<00:04:15.659> if<00:04:16.079> I<00:04:16.380> went<00:04:16.620> dark<00:04:16.769> templars<00:04:17.159> I'd<00:04:17.310> be<00:04:17.430> pretty

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549 
is if I went dark templars I'd be pretty

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:19.460 
is if I went dark templars I'd be pretty
much<00:04:17.789> good<00:04:18.030> because<00:04:18.150> he<00:04:18.359> has<00:04:18.449> canyons<00:04:18.720> and<00:04:19.169> I

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.470 
much good because he has canyons and I

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:21.050 
much good because he has canyons and I

he's trying to attack yeah and yeah he
has<00:06:33.240> no<00:06:33.360> force<00:06:33.690> so<00:06:33.960> he<00:06:34.139> doesn't<00:06:34.260> need<00:06:34.380> our

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:34.440 
has no force so he doesn't need our

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:35.930 
has no force so he doesn't need our
robotics<00:06:35.010> because<00:06:35.430> I<00:06:35.490> can't<00:06:35.700> see<00:06:35.820> the

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:35.940 
robotics because I can't see the

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:38.000 
robotics because I can't see the
observer<00:06:36.270> and<00:06:36.539> I<00:06:37.080> wouldn't<00:06:37.320> I<00:06:37.380> would<00:06:37.530> I<00:06:37.740> can't

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:38.010 
observer and I wouldn't I would I can't

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:39.620 
observer and I wouldn't I would I can't
even<00:06:38.159> see<00:06:38.250> the<00:06:38.280> observer<00:06:38.580> blurred<00:06:38.940> okay<00:06:39.479> yeah

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:39.630

even see the observer blurred okay yeah
so<00:06:39.810> he<00:06:39.900> says<00:06:40.080> GG

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:40.770
