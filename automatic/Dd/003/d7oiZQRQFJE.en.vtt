00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:06.240
 we also have the option to connect 

00:00:03.509 --> 00:00:09.060
 a guitar a common guitar to the ipad 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:12.450
 would be connected in this entry we see 

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:15.210
 where the headset goes for that 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.789
 we need in a device that is called 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:20.400
 haiti which is the adapter so that 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.050
 can connect the guitar then 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.550
 we select the garageband in this 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:29.029
 I will show you the moment but without 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:29.029
 guitar and it will show us a list of 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:33.490
 of heads 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:36.420
 let's go here we have different combos 

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:38.490
 we have the cranky and distorted 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.600
 indicted 

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:45.579
 and we have to create our own 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:48.159
 our own boxes 

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:51.399
 we also have all the options that 

00:00:48.159 --> 00:00:54.179
 we can modify it as if it were a 

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:54.179
 real head 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:59.050
 we have 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:02.170
 the input signal when connecting 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:03.930
 our guitar we are going to here and for 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:06.930
 listen to it we're going to have to activate 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.930
 beautiful 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:10.810
 in our case we do not have connected 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:14.140
 no guitar then is taking 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:15.880
 the microphone of the same iPad what it does 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:18.300
 that generates that noise because it generates a 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.300
 coupling 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:24.560
 then that more or less is everything 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:27.430
 who can later have the option here 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:29.320
 to add effects 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:33.250
 in this case we have added these two 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:36.280
 effects we can go here and select what 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:41.430
 that we want to add or if we want what 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:41.430
 we take out the effects 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.710
 and we add more effects 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:53.570
 then you can play with those things 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:56.700
 we play there and he's going to show us a list 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:59.720
 of effects let's move it a little closer 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.720
 if it looks good 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:07.430
 then of these effects we can choose 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:09.200
 anyone for example the auto funk 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:11.590
 guitarists must more or less know 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:14.420
 what are these effects and 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:17.390
 use them as if it were a pedalboard 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:19.340
 We can use the ipad iphone or ipod 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:21.850
 touch as if it were a pedalboard 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.850
 effects
