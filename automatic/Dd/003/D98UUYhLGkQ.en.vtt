where I take my looks for less requests

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.859 
where I take my looks for less requests
and<00:00:20.070> it<00:00:20.369> came<00:00:20.520> out<00:00:20.670> a<00:00:20.699> lot<00:00:21.029> so<00:00:21.240> I<00:00:21.270> decided<00:00:21.600> to<00:00:21.720> do

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
and it came out a lot so I decided to do

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.080 
and it came out a lot so I decided to do
it<00:00:22.020> since<00:00:22.529> it<00:00:22.740> is<00:00:22.920> a<00:00:23.189> recent<00:00:23.640> picture<00:00:23.850> of

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
it since it is a recent picture of

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.920 
it since it is a recent picture of
Beyonce<00:00:24.779> and<00:00:25.050> she's<00:00:25.350> pregnant<00:00:25.710> so<00:00:26.189> I<00:00:27.119> I<00:00:27.599> think

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
Beyonce and she's pregnant so I I think

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.750 
Beyonce and she's pregnant so I I think
I<00:00:28.019> was<00:00:28.140> able<00:00:28.439> to<00:00:28.470> cut<00:00:28.740> down<00:00:28.949> the<00:00:29.130> price<00:00:29.369> by<00:00:29.580> like

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
I was able to cut down the price by like

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.049 
I was able to cut down the price by like
50%<00:00:30.359> which<00:00:31.050> is<00:00:31.260> a<00:00:31.529> lot<00:00:31.890> because<00:00:32.130> she<00:00:33.030> obviously

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
50% which is a lot because she obviously

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.080 
50% which is a lot because she obviously
was<00:00:33.809> like<00:00:34.050> really<00:00:34.260> expensive<00:00:34.680> stuff<00:00:35.070> but<00:00:35.850> um

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
was like really expensive stuff but um

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.420 
was like really expensive stuff but um
if<00:00:36.420> I<00:00:36.570> can<00:00:36.930> remember<00:00:37.230> I<00:00:37.649> know<00:00:37.710> she<00:00:37.860> wore<00:00:38.190> like
