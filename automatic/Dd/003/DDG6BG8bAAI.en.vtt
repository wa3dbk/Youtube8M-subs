always<00:00:26.189> refer<00:00:26.730> to<00:00:26.910> this<00:00:27.029> process<00:00:27.630> as<00:00:27.810> hacking

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
always refer to this process as hacking

to keep things simple even though soft
modding<00:00:30.810> would<00:00:30.960> probably<00:00:31.590> be<00:00:31.740> the<00:00:31.890> best

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
modding would probably be the best

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.540 
modding would probably be the best
definition<00:00:32.309> I<00:00:33.110> say<00:00:34.110> this<00:00:34.290> because<00:00:34.350> all<00:00:35.160> will

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
definition I say this because all will

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.970 
definition I say this because all will
be<00:00:35.760> doing<00:00:36.149> is<00:00:36.329> modifying<00:00:36.989> the<00:00:37.170> wii's<00:00:37.350> software

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
be doing is modifying the wii's software

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.560 
be doing is modifying the wii's software
by<00:00:38.160> installing<00:00:38.579> the<00:00:38.730> hungry<00:00:39.120> channel<00:00:39.450> and

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
by installing the hungry channel and

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.709 
by installing the hungry channel and
some<00:00:39.750> other<00:00:39.930> stuff<00:00:40.020> with<00:00:40.590> an<00:00:40.739> SD<00:00:40.890> card<00:00:41.540> so<00:00:42.540> this

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
some other stuff with an SD card so this

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.090 
some other stuff with an SD card so this
means<00:00:42.899> we're<00:00:43.200> not<00:00:43.320> going<00:00:43.500> to<00:00:43.559> be<00:00:43.649> taking<00:00:44.010> a

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
means we're not going to be taking a

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.430 
means we're not going to be taking a
part<00:00:44.340> of<00:00:44.370> a<00:00:44.430> we<00:00:44.610> installing<00:00:45.510> a<00:00:45.660> mod<00:00:45.899> chip<00:00:46.170> or

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
part of a we installing a mod chip or

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.049 
part of a we installing a mod chip or
anything<00:00:46.739> crazy<00:00:46.950> like<00:00:47.129> that<00:00:47.280> that<00:00:47.910> would<00:00:48.030> be

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
anything crazy like that that would be

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.990 
anything crazy like that that would be
hard<00:00:48.329> modding<00:00:49.160> all<00:00:50.160> right<00:00:50.340> so<00:00:50.520> what<00:00:50.730> is<00:00:50.850> the

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
hard modding all right so what is the

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.209 
hard modding all right so what is the
hungry<00:00:51.300> channel<00:00:51.660> the<00:00:52.500> homebrew<00:00:52.800> channel<00:00:53.010> is

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
hungry channel the homebrew channel is

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:54.560 
hungry channel the homebrew channel is
the<00:00:53.309> we<00:00:53.460> channel<00:00:53.489> that<00:00:54.000> lets<00:00:54.210> you<00:00:54.390> load

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
the we channel that lets you load

homebrew applications from an SD card

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.229 
homebrew applications from an SD card
the<00:00:57.840> most<00:00:58.050> popular<00:00:58.620> applications<00:00:59.340> are<00:00:59.670> the

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
the most popular applications are the

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.619 
the most popular applications are the
USB<00:01:00.660> loader<00:01:00.899> is<00:01:01.079> like<00:01:01.289> USB<00:01:02.039> loader<00:01:02.399> GX<00:01:02.629> which

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
USB loader is like USB loader GX which

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.630

from<00:01:05.880> a<00:01:06.000> USB<00:01:06.270> drive<00:01:07.189> okay<00:01:08.189> so<00:01:08.250> we<00:01:08.520> need<00:01:08.640> to

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
from a USB drive okay so we need to

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.550 
from a USB drive okay so we need to
install<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.240> hungry<00:01:09.570> channel<00:01:09.930> and<00:01:10.080> to<00:01:10.409> do

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
install the hungry channel and to do

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.350 
install the hungry channel and to do
that<00:01:10.740> you'll<00:01:11.100> need<00:01:11.280> to<00:01:11.340> use<00:01:11.580> an<00:01:11.880> exploit<00:01:12.330> that

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
that you'll need to use an exploit that

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.170 
that you'll need to use an exploit that
allows<00:01:12.780> you<00:01:12.930> to<00:01:12.960> install<00:01:13.380> it<00:01:13.439> from<00:01:13.650> an<00:01:13.830> SD<00:01:14.130> card

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:14.180 
allows you to install it from an SD card

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:19.520 
allows you to install it from an SD card
such<00:01:15.180> as<00:01:15.420> Indiana<00:01:16.170> poems<00:01:17.630> so<00:01:18.630> basically<00:01:19.290> this

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
such as Indiana poems so basically this

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.730 
such as Indiana poems so basically this
method<00:01:20.040> is<00:01:20.250> gonna<00:01:21.030> use<00:01:21.360> the<00:01:21.869> Indiana<00:01:22.320> poems

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
method is gonna use the Indiana poems

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.490 
method is gonna use the Indiana poems
exploit<00:01:23.250> to<00:01:23.670> install<00:01:24.090> the<00:01:24.270> hungry<00:01:24.600> channel<00:01:24.960> so

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
exploit to install the hungry channel so

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.830 
exploit to install the hungry channel so
you<00:01:25.560> can<00:01:25.830> then<00:01:26.280> use<00:01:26.549> the<00:01:26.729> USB<00:01:26.909> loader<00:01:27.240> GX<00:01:27.360> to

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
you can then use the USB loader GX to

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.219 
you can then use the USB loader GX to
play<00:01:28.020> games<00:01:28.320> from<00:01:28.560> a<00:01:28.680> USB<00:01:28.950> Drive<00:01:29.840> to<00:01:30.840> do<00:01:31.020> this

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
play games from a USB Drive to do this
