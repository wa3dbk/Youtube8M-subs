00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:26.860
 I was born in 1965 and all this 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:28.780
 started on July 17, 1995 

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:32.009
 this is a documentary about muay thai 

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:34.019
 the Thai art of fighting without weapons 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.000
 and dell because this work is done from 

00:00:34.019 --> 00:00:37.440
 the so-called country of smiles for 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.600
 get to Indian lands the level 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.120
 for sadly called pain reserve 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.219
 rich is something that you will have to intuit 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.850
 explain it can not be in only you can 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:50.760
 feel so alone can you live 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:53.010
 in muay thai a fighting style a 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.930
 style to be trained as a person 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.420
 I work extreme sport and an art in 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.180
 one definitely a way of life 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.159
 where there is no room for hesitation or fear 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:04.259
 where to understand it and feel it so 

00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:06.720
 only one thing is worth giving yourself to one hundred 

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:08.220
 per cent in body and soul we will discover 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.600
 why muay thai was formerly 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.090
 must participate in the training 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.500
 princes for his ascension to the throne as 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.390
 happened to be practiced only by the 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.940
 royalty and by the army to the people in 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.920
 general as it was taking hold ended by 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:21.450
 become the national sport in the 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.610
 livelihood of many young people and become 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.080
 in the pride of an entire town we can 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.909
 meet through the managers of the 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.310
 professional training camps 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.869
 from the ring of practitioners what is the 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.909
 meaning and meaning that for each 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.569
 one of them has discovered a 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:38.340
 common bond in all of them respect 

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:41.369
 respect not only in words but also in 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.770
 everything with acts we will see as children of very 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.179
 short age they prepare and fight being able 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.429
 see the reality that sometimes we 

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:49.560
 presents is very far from converting 

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:51.869
 children in merchandise rather everything 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.820
 otherwise it is thanks to muay thai to 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.970
 those who retain their essence that these 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.030
 children begin to see 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:58.780
 that before they were presented very black 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.330
 we will know firsthand stories 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.220
 such as ban today its 20 years , a

 family that loves and supports you is this 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:09.130
 a story that began fifteen years 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.899

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:13.120

 he has stopped taking care of him becoming 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:19.270
 only in his teacher but especially in his 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.670
 father and family we will know place and

 thailand for more than 15 years with 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.090
 a story full of combats and 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:38.440
 teaching in the cradle of this art with 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.350
 everything that this represents in a country 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:43.420
 very proud of their great traditions 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:45.940
 teacher for the cndh ayutthaya a man 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:48.040
 that at 56 years old he has one of the 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:50.050
 better training techniques and 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.670
 especially a heart so big that 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:53.640
 it only resembles the joy with which 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:56.370
 transmits your knowledge 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:58.260
 there is here yuta put thing very one of the 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.720
 greatest fighters with almost 400 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.670
 fighting behind his back and now he 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.080
 opens the way with his new school where 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.680
 from the first day he transmits his 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:08.970
 sympathy with skill and knowledge 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:11.160
 cruel and the army general is 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:12.720
 there weapon of the bangkok masters and 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.700
 custodians of traditional styles that 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.650
 they refuse to disappear as are the 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.959
 ancient styles of chaya and coral 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.880
 respectively all this that you will see 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:22.440
 was made with a double purpose the 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:24.420
 first will be to show the benefits 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:26.550
 that this hard old art sport has 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:27.989
 so we can not understand everything 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:29.640
 can be seen when two boxers are 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:31.140
 face in a ring where only 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:33.450
 we get to see extreme violence and 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:34.980
 free the second one will try 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:36.570
 raise the necessary funds to 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:38.580
 build a foster home for children 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:40.019
 and young people who lack means as well as 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:43.290
 a school of dead and reservation 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:45.480
 pentridge in south dakota usa but 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:47.489
 without diskota Sioux as is commonly 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:49.739
 he knows how to make this documentary 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:51.150
 spoiled some things all 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:52.410
 good but above the interest 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:53.820
 particular 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:55.860
 this documentary tries to be an option 

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:57.959
 freely chosen the option of 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:59.550
 share despite all the option of 

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:01.170
 the delivery despite the losses 

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:04.200
 the option to show with acts what 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:05.550
 with words it is said but above all it has 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:07.080
 been the option of a living in a 

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:09.480
 world that devours people and resources 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:11.970
 without any intention to choose the delivery 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:14.340
 disinterested choose not to contribute 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:16.560
 distrust of the fear of resentment or 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:18.209
 selfishness has been the option of despite 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:20.220
 all try to get out of that circle that 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:22.620
 today we call progress where words 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:26.130
 as kindness empathy help collaboration 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:28.740
 affection respect and so are in the mouth of 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:30.540
 all but where also come to the 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:32.580
 Most of the time we look 

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:34.140
 only by ourselves to 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:36.390
 then end up complaining about the world that 

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:38.040
 we will leave to those who will proceed us 

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:40.110
 day almost 20 years ago I did not find 

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:41.380
 doing what the Lord asked him to do 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:43.600
 following 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:45.460
 please help me to make big the little 

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:48.460
 good that I have and small everything bad 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:50.830
 please teach him how to do it I did it 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:53.230
 for a reason to be able to give my daughter 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:55.300
 something more than education and a roof he 

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:57.850
 he listened to me helps me to have that strength and 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:59.980
 that clarity and when learning everything changed 

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:01.810
 and in that change between losses and 

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:04.090
 failures between achievements and joys 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:06.820
 this work appeared the bread in rich 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:09.490
 project the muay thai in the kingdom of 

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:10.900
 thailand there are many people by the 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:12.700
 world doing or trying to make 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:14.470
 this a better world each of them 

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:16.390
 has a gift a quality or some 

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:18.820
 knowledge that helps and uses 

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:21.670
 for this purpose of equal rich as poor 

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:22.180
 wise ignorant white reds black or 

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:24.910
 yellows 

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:26.680
 there are people with those qualities 

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:28.780
 they use them for their own and only 

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:31.210
 personal benefit and others for what 

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:32.620
 the opposite is the universal history of 

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:36.010
 this planet since the chronicles 

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:37.450
 there are now the balance is broken the 

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:39.730
 world is governed more by fear than by 

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:41.980
 courage can be seen in any 

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:44.050
 aspect in any information in 

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:45.790
 any event today everything moves with 

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:47.980
 fear as the basis and sustenance of everything 

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:50.230
 others but still 

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:52.810
 of people who drive by and for their 

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:54.240
 unique and dirty interests away from 

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:56.200
 people who look the other way 

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:57.850
 there are people who face 

00:05:56.200 --> 00:06:00.010
 brave the fight to go against what 

00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:03.310
 established something that we could summarize 

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:04.840
 with two words more humanity I do not 

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:07.120
 It is up to me to rate myself on whether 

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:09.640
 I am better or worse about doing well or 

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:11.740
 bad I can only say that my tool 

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:14.350
 to try this job was the muay 

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:15.840
 thai and it is through him that this 

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:17.730
 tried to make 

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:19.740
 I hope the day arrives when the 

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:21.990
 skills that we each have in addition 

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:23.830
 to bring sustenance and shelter bring a 

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:25.960
 better world 

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:28.330
