00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:05.339
 basement congratulations what a rash man 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:07.170
 Yes 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:10.320
 sesto is a very nice result for us 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:12.750
 and see it is irodios what psv 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.099
 current difficult phase and I have it myself 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.289
 experienced and I know what it feels like 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.660
 you just lose yourself rationally 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.439
 surprisingly beautiful and we can continue 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.720
 look 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:24.119
 6th yes as much win here not 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.460
 often when I watch the first half was one 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.410
 a soft one was not like that 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.429
 big rashes are out because it's how 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.460
 would you be at rest 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:34.500
 no why not much about the same yes 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.420
 we could actually have our own here 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.239
 play game and were pressure early 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.950
 and therefore had some difficulty with it 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.290
 two of them did something different 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.510
 for vitesse great result if you 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.120
 have not seen lessons at all 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.879
 Real because I found PSV the 1st half 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.170
 we started better than when we started 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.399
 I don't get the grip at all 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.690
 found very open competition because 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.030
 even though we did not play well have 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:00.059
 it also had many chances first hero 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.010
 but he also had psv and after and then you go 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.180
 Immediately a rest in which you nevertheless 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.979
 is disappointed because of the last minute 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.780
 rest still happened maters rightly so 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.890
 I did think the second half we 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.680
 then also in there is something else gone 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.939
 put that you just felt in 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.680
 the second that we have that grip completely 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.150
 get it back and then you will see that we 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.830
 just play well 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.570
 what was it like when you were in the field 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.640
 everything succeeds everything goes well how 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:27.390
 does that feel nice 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:29.220
 and yes maybe something bad for their yes to 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.229
 with supporters but yes for our status 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.430
 quo you get it is 2 ones being through 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.310
 number three one 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.600
 then also complete back day and 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.510
 also not from whole audience going there now 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.750
 stand behind 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:41.890
 the is still difficult yes I I at 3 one 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:43.210
 all words already made everyone very happy 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:43.690
 I shouted to the sides as is still 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:45.250
 did not happen 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:47.620
 because this was such a weird game that 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:49.900
 concerns that you have to be concentrated 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:52.420
 stay and not get a stupid goal 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:53.710
 that it does happen late as divine 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.260
 from the kickoff that we are the four two 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:57.760
 and made and the confidence that you know 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:00.160
 is with this opponent in advance 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:02.500
 very fragile and therefore also very logical 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:03.880
 human and it took a long time 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.170
 before we could use it 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.760
 but eventually happens even 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.890
 just about your goal a whole 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:10.210
 important it was at that moment 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:11.500
 psv makes two three 

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:14.950
 audience starts to believe in again 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:17.380
 and then the ball comes and then pops 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:21.010
 nice with it and I moved inside 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:22.120
 please then so often our 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:23.530
 very nice result and 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.730
 can't I wend or vitesse earlier though 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:26.890
 make sure i'm just at a big club 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:28.540
 but it is fantastic i played against 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:30.430
 teams that are already under pressure 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:34.780
 cocu you can do that too and then it will be 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:36.430
 become visual 521 so what do you think 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.590
 yes it is very easy to say 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:39.480
 that you then 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:43.200
 I don't think about that 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:44.580
 remain ourselves and the weeks before 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.900
 go off if you see party with such a with 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.010
 you think that with such a train happening 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.030
 then on but not at that time 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.160
 frankly with your own 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.450
 team is doing well 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.290
 yes those kind of things that just welcome 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.290
 every role that goes into it
