like<00:02:01.280> ostriches<00:02:02.280> it<00:02:02.520> might<00:02:02.700> be<00:02:02.880> exciting<00:02:03.420> no

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:04.260 
like ostriches it might be exciting no

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.920 
like ostriches it might be exciting no
it<00:02:04.410> didn't<00:02:04.710> really<00:02:04.740> matter<00:02:05.250> I<00:02:05.820> be<00:02:06.630> easier<00:02:06.900> to

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
it didn't really matter I be easier to

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.740 
it didn't really matter I be easier to
say<00:02:07.080> that<00:02:07.290> one<00:02:07.470> with<00:02:07.890> the<00:02:08.010> head<00:02:08.190> in<00:02:08.220> the<00:02:08.310> ground

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:08.750 
say that one with the head in the ground

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.470 
say that one with the head in the ground
is<00:02:09.750> that<00:02:10.110> technically<00:02:10.649> pedophilia<00:02:11.310> I<00:02:11.700> think

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
is that technically pedophilia I think

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.780 
is that technically pedophilia I think
it's<00:02:12.600> these<00:02:12.810> two<00:02:12.990> young<00:02:13.140> oh<00:02:13.650> so<00:02:14.430> there's<00:02:14.610> not<00:02:14.730> a

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
it's these two young oh so there's not a

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.500 
it's these two young oh so there's not a
subset<00:02:15.390> of<00:02:15.420> like<00:02:15.950> you<00:02:16.950> know<00:02:16.980> pedophilia<00:02:17.670> it

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
subset of like you know pedophilia it

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:19.820 
subset of like you know pedophilia it
would<00:02:18.630> probably<00:02:18.840> depend<00:02:19.050> on<00:02:19.350> the<00:02:19.440> age<00:02:19.500> of<00:02:19.650> the

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
would probably depend on the age of the

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.410 
would probably depend on the age of the
course<00:02:20.100> so<00:02:20.610> do<00:02:20.700> you<00:02:20.790> think<00:02:20.850> you<00:02:21.030> see<00:02:21.270> this
