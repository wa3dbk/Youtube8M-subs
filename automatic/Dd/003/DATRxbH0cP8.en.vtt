00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.769 
understand that what's low cost to one
person<00:00:21.769> may<00:00:22.769> not<00:00:22.980> be<00:00:23.189> low<00:00:23.430> cost<00:00:23.760> to<00:00:24.390> someone

person may not be low cost to someone
else<00:00:24.990> okay<00:00:25.760> so<00:00:27.470> you<00:00:28.470> just<00:00:28.529> have<00:00:28.769> to<00:00:28.890> keep<00:00:29.039> in

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
else okay so you just have to keep in

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.780 
else okay so you just have to keep in
mind<00:00:29.550> that<00:00:30.050> the<00:00:31.050> you<00:00:31.289> know<00:00:31.410> just<00:00:31.679> basically<00:00:32.669> a

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
mind that the you know just basically a

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.380 
mind that the you know just basically a
generalization<00:00:33.890> but<00:00:34.890> these<00:00:35.880> can<00:00:36.090> be<00:00:36.180> had<00:00:36.360> for

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
generalization but these can be had for

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.290 
generalization but these can be had for
under<00:00:36.899> fifty<00:00:37.440> dollars<00:00:37.800> so<00:00:38.340> i<00:00:38.610> consider<00:00:39.059> that<00:00:39.120> a

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
under fifty dollars so i consider that a

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.560 
under fifty dollars so i consider that a
low-cost<00:00:39.719> EDC<00:00:40.500> and<00:00:41.090> i'll<00:00:42.090> go<00:00:42.180> ahead<00:00:42.210> and<00:00:42.390> get

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
low-cost EDC and i'll go ahead and get

00:00:42.570 --> 00:01:01.889 
low-cost EDC and i'll go ahead and get
these<00:00:42.690> out<00:00:42.870> of<00:00:42.930> the<00:00:43.050> boxes<00:00:43.469> here

00:01:01.889 --> 00:01:01.899 

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:05.380 

and<00:01:02.899> this<00:01:03.860> is<00:01:04.040> the<00:01:04.159> same<00:01:04.400> knife<00:01:04.670> except<00:01:05.330> for

and this is the same knife except for

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:07.960 
and this is the same knife except for
there<00:01:05.900> is<00:01:06.020> one<00:01:06.050> difference<00:01:06.470> to<00:01:06.920> it<00:01:07.070> which<00:01:07.850> you

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:07.970 
there is one difference to it which you

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:14.740 
there is one difference to it which you
can<00:01:08.119> probably<00:01:08.360> tell<00:01:08.630> already<00:01:09.050> this<00:01:13.600> is<00:01:14.600> the

can probably tell already this is the

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.499 
can probably tell already this is the
same<00:01:15.050> knife<00:01:15.290> same<00:01:15.680> configuration<00:01:16.490> but<00:01:17.150> it<00:01:17.360> has

nylon and the steel on the blade is vg10
I<00:02:08.259> likely<00:02:09.259> g10<00:02:09.619> steal<00:02:10.209> it<00:02:11.209> takes<00:02:12.140> a<00:02:12.319> very<00:02:12.500> sharp

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
I likely g10 steal it takes a very sharp

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.820 
I likely g10 steal it takes a very sharp
edge<00:02:13.160> it<00:02:14.090> has<00:02:14.780> pretty<00:02:15.050> good<00:02:15.230> edge<00:02:15.380> durability

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
edge it has pretty good edge durability

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:18.220 
edge it has pretty good edge durability
and<00:02:16.190> it's<00:02:16.760> very<00:02:17.000> easy<00:02:17.150> for<00:02:17.360> me<00:02:17.630> to<00:02:17.660> sharpen<00:02:18.110> up

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
and it's very easy for me to sharpen up

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.559 
and it's very easy for me to sharpen up
so<00:02:18.709> I<00:02:18.739> do<00:02:18.890> like<00:02:19.190> the<00:02:19.370> vg-10<00:02:19.910> steel<00:02:20.209> on<00:02:20.420> these

00:02:20.559 --> 00:02:20.569 
so I do like the vg-10 steel on these

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:31.180 
so I do like the vg-10 steel on these
guys<00:02:25.209> the<00:02:26.209> pocket<00:02:26.989> clip<00:02:27.260> is<00:02:28.569> movable<00:02:30.010> you<00:02:31.010> can

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170 
very thin profile and when you have it

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:56.710 
very thin profile and when you have it
in<00:02:54.260> your<00:02:54.349> pocket<00:02:54.879> you<00:02:55.879> barely<00:02:56.120> even<00:02:56.330> know<00:02:56.450> it's

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 
in your pocket you barely even know it's

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:02.050 
in your pocket you barely even know it's
there<00:02:59.020> it's<00:03:00.020> just<00:03:00.290> a<00:03:00.440> great<00:03:00.680> EDC<00:03:01.370> knife<00:03:01.400> but

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
there it's just a great EDC knife but

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:03.940 
there it's just a great EDC knife but
it's<00:03:02.209> but<00:03:02.569> yet<00:03:02.720> it's<00:03:02.870> still<00:03:02.989> not<00:03:03.319> too<00:03:03.379> small<00:03:03.890> I

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950

chores<00:05:54.760> I<00:05:55.150> think<00:05:56.140> this<00:05:56.230> is<00:05:56.290> just<00:05:56.440> perfect<00:05:57.900> just

00:05:58.890 --> 00:05:58.900

the<00:05:59.020> right<00:05:59.050> size<00:05:59.440> in<00:05:59.830> my<00:06:00.520> opinion<00:06:02.520> under<00:06:03.520> fifty
