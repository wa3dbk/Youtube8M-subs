right<00:05:55.450> this<00:05:55.720> is<00:05:55.870> risky

00:05:59.350 --> 00:05:59.360 

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:03.459 

all<00:05:59.870> right<00:06:00.009> for<00:06:01.009> the<00:06:01.099> moment<00:06:02.199> so<00:06:03.199> I'm<00:06:03.289> going<00:06:03.439> to

all right for the moment so I'm going to
do

00:06:06.519 --> 00:06:06.529 

00:06:06.529 --> 00:06:11.619 

but<00:06:07.009> in<00:06:07.129> good<00:06:07.249> time<00:06:07.749> you<00:06:08.749> can<00:06:08.899> do<00:06:09.049> more<00:06:10.509> just<00:06:11.509> as

00:06:11.619 --> 00:06:11.629 
but in good time you can do more just as

00:06:11.629 --> 00:06:24.299 
but in good time you can do more just as
soon<00:06:11.839> as<00:06:12.049> I<00:06:12.139> us<00:06:12.349> five<00:06:12.679> aria<00:06:13.039> is<00:06:13.069> gone<00:06:14.619> right

00:06:59.770 --> 00:06:59.780 
I jamuna is also animus notion that

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:02.560 
I jamuna is also animus notion that
we're<00:06:59.960> not<00:07:00.350> got<00:07:00.530> the<00:07:00.560> converts<00:07:00.980> well<00:07:01.280> so<00:07:02.180> that

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:02.570 
we're not got the converts well so that

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:04.030 
we're not got the converts well so that
a<00:07:02.600> while<00:07:02.750> but<00:07:02.900> had<00:07:02.990> not<00:07:03.110> died<00:07:03.350> I<00:07:03.380> would<00:07:03.680> not<00:07:03.920> be

00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:04.040 
a while but had not died I would not be

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:06.700 
a while but had not died I would not be
able<00:07:04.100> to<00:07:04.220> convert<00:07:04.520> it<00:07:05.110> all<00:07:06.110> right<00:07:06.230> this<00:07:06.440> level

00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:06.710 
able to convert it all right this level

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:11.640 
able to convert it all right this level
almost<00:07:06.860> over<00:07:07.280> just<00:07:08.020> those<00:07:09.020> few<00:07:09.320> guys<00:07:09.500> to<00:07:09.530> get

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:11.650 
almost over just those few guys to get

00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:16.060 
almost over just those few guys to get
it's<00:07:12.650> quite<00:07:12.890> unique<00:07:13.070> level<00:07:13.550> I<00:07:14.920> think<00:07:15.920> that's

00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:16.070 
it's quite unique level I think that's

00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:23.410 
it's quite unique level I think that's
