00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.299
 yes 

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:10.020
 What's behind this in this in 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:13.140
 ezequiel that they say they are and why not 

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:15.410
 when me my old my daughter who went to 

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:15.410
 notice 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.510
 42 years later 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:29.970
 and it will leave a banner 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:29.970
 being treated my daughter put me on 3rd 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:36.559
 but it's still paper 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:49.890
 and it's time for the criminal 12 steps 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.510
 for some things and it's one is a 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.829
 eternity but in the case of criminal 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.510
 surely the distance is very 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.670
 short and long as you look with very 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.800
 little kid doing I had that feeling 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.699
 I always have what I get if you and 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.699
 more the car removed 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:12.220
 strong to the middle like a stick or what is 

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:14.140
 but I have two because the usual 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:17.980
 and that's how much confidence I have in my 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:19.930
 my partner and fellow people who 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:22.300
 he passes very quiet smata when he was 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:25.960
 knit goal I festejé quiet 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:28.820
 because I was so nervous that same 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:31.120
 and screaming desperate not 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:34.210
 the truth that tele 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:36.790
 the people and my partner made me yesterday 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:40.180
 to be very calm, it is always said that 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:43.210
 the archers study the performers 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:47.410
 in this case the other way around you had an idea 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:49.330
 like then I used to throw and nation or if 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:51.010
 in this case I had seen it shortcut 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:52.660
 criminals not the truth that I did not have 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:54.020
 seen and no no no I 'm not study of the 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:55.820
 rivals yo 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.590
 It does not care about anything 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:00.950
 does not stick this in history against several 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:02.840
 I try to practice and improve day 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.150
 a day 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:07.280
 better that same 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:10.030
 I practice with torrico that I think that 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.030
 it is very criminal ero 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:17.110
 one of the best penalty kicks 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:18.520
 that there is a hand duel for Argentina 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.709
 by hand in the week as you come with 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:22.450
 torrico draw they call me grabbing the 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:25.660
 because I feel like I said it 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:29.980
 I welcome the blow to penalties but we are 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:32.050
 tied and kicked when torrico that 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:34.840
 we walk some do not go to play another 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:36.280
 team and there goes the data that is the 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:43.319
 problem 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:43.319
 get stuck because it's difficult for me 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:52.069
 I think for a moment in toni kross 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:55.340
 luka modric gareth bale james rodríguez 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:58.740
 Christian ronaldo karim benzema 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:02.510
 they are going to face those monsters yes 

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:05.269
 today looking at it here or looking at it 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:07.549
 on TV are some phenomena I'm going to 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:09.099
 always respect but once 

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:11.700
 start and the start of the game 

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:14.640
 the end we have to trial 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:16.470
 it's like that it does not shrink me at all 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:21.150
 that worry that they worry toni 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:23.670
 kross for god and if not to boot like that 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:25.290
 he tells us the court I have to start 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:27.959
 I went into action on the court 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:30.319
 there is no better than being the court or not 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:31.849
 there are better than my classmates 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:35.180
 I love you I want to take you for a 

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:37.689
 Paraguayan soccer moment 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:37.689
 that you know very well 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:42.760
 and in fact we are in these hours with 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:44.380
 a new coach in the national team 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:45.900
 argentina and tata martino is 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:48.000
 just who we take you to the 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:50.620
 Paraguayan selection 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:54.040
 tell me what coach is going to 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:55.950
 find the Argentine team is not 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:58.530
 of him is a coach with 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:00.810
 with a lot of personality it will be very 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:03.599
 well to Argentine football like when 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:05.660
 played when he had here in new he was very 

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:05.660
 all right 

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:11.160
 and it gives a lot of hierarchy 

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:13.680
 and today the Argentine team the truth 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:16.739
 that we put everything for him because he is 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:18.959
 a big association with history with 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:21.030
 a lot of history and not everyone gets to 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:23.790
 lead 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:25.740
 Argentina and today is the and I think that what 

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:27.810
 she does very well congratulate her on her 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:30.120
 family to his coaching staff and I think I 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:33.210
 do well because it is a technical 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:34.470
 very capable not good you had with 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:36.000
 He deals with the selection of Paraguay , a 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:38.190
 World large room in South Africa 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.870
 final if we come to agreement is a 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:41.280
 technician I think very tactical studies a lot 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:42.990
 the rivals 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:45.840
 is very smart for campus or 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:48.420
 This party says what you're going to win over here 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:50.100
 we do this or be careful that you are 

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:51.840
 very good not to be careful with the word 

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:53.520
 with funes was a is near the area 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.720
 because I nod very well I ask you look 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:55.710
 the ball 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:58.500
 the truth that he is a very technical 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:59.970
 intelligent not if martino has maybe 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:02.010
 as features and coaches that 

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:04.680
 maybe they have their way of playing and the 

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:05.880
 campus regardless of the campus 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:07.650
 and have the characteristic of 

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:09.300
 young people play their way and they look for 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:11.449
 the petén suits his way of playing 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:12.889
 and coaches that 

00:05:11.449 --> 00:05:14.330
 they try to adapt to 

00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:16.210
 characteristics of the genes you have and 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:18.169
 the 'tata' martino played in a way 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:19.969
 when he did it in just for you or for 

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:21.680
 freedom played another way in the 

00:05:19.969 --> 00:05:23.509
 selection did it in a way 

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:26.689
 different in google if in barcelona with 

00:05:23.509 --> 00:05:28.940
 coincide with this if he has he 

00:05:26.689 --> 00:05:31.430
 adapts a lot the colors that he has 

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:34.040
 for example Paraguay we were 

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:36.230
 young people we want 

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:38.810
 We were runners that we put in 

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:40.380
 we win we win well up and then 

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:45.570
 it was 

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:48.600
 notice that in the one that played I want I 

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:51.360
 that suits the team that has 

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:53.430
 the club's global commitment remains 

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:55.860
 quite far away lounge that will go full 

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:57.960
 for the local championship 

00:05:55.860 --> 00:06:00.660
 you have to stick your head back the 

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:03.820
 domestic routine if now to enjoy what 

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:06.940
 What is left is all day 

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:08.590
 the truth is not easy to 

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:10.480
 liberators so you have to enjoy it 

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:14.440
 but unfortunately we do not have much 

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:17.470
 time to celebrate now but today 

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:19.180
 it ends tomorrow have a little more to 

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:22.210
 talk a little more and we were already 

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:24.070
 all full what is racing and what 

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:26.260
 that the local tournament took san lorenzo and 

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:28.780
 we have to plug in again to 

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:30.340
 try to catch from the top not in 

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:31.690
 these congratulations and I hope you have a 

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:35.860
 time with your family to take some 

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:39.100
 mates exists where we started as the 

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:41.050
 We paddled and we ended up arriving until this 

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:43.540
 place that I think is a place of 

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:46.950
 privilege that for few if it is for 

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:48.720
 few but I think what 

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:52.500
 what has not yet had the luck 

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:54.780
 you would be told that there is a group left and that 

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:56.760
 Always train as much as you think 

00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:58.710
 encounter has its reward we make a 

00:06:56.760 --> 00:07:01.020
 the furniture store to the location where 

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:02.220
 we buy ortigosa is needed I do not know if 

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:05.660
 no place thanks to be and 

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:05.660
 congratulations is not you
