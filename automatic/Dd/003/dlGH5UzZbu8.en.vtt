00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
and it looks like this one two three

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.800 
and it looks like this one two three
continue<00:01:02.160> on<00:01:02.430> five<00:01:03.210> six<00:01:04.110> seven<00:01:05.070> a<00:01:05.659> little<00:01:06.659> bit

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
continue on five six seven a little bit

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.270 
continue on five six seven a little bit
trickier<00:01:07.290> because<00:01:07.740> of<00:01:08.340> this<00:01:08.640> back<00:01:09.119> action<00:01:10.280> the

trickier because of this back action the

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.250 
trickier because of this back action the
key<00:01:11.520> is<00:01:11.790> how<00:01:12.000> to<00:01:12.060> place<00:01:12.390> your<00:01:12.510> foot<00:01:12.780> and<00:01:13.080> i

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.830 
key is how to place your foot and i
would<00:01:13.439> recommend<00:01:14.000> that<00:01:15.000> you<00:01:15.240> should<00:01:15.450> go<00:01:15.630> talk

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
would recommend that you should go talk

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.499 
would recommend that you should go talk
to<00:01:15.900> a<00:01:16.110> professional<00:01:16.710> dance<00:01:17.549> instructor<00:01:18.150> to

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
to a professional dance instructor to

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:19.999 
to a professional dance instructor to
kind<00:01:18.720> of<00:01:18.750> get<00:01:18.900> your<00:01:19.080> balance<00:01:19.229> underneath<00:01:19.799> you

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
kind of get your balance underneath you

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.859 
kind of get your balance underneath you
because<00:01:20.490> this<00:01:20.670> is<00:01:20.880> somewhat<00:01:21.299> of<00:01:21.330> an<00:01:21.540> advanced

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
because this is somewhat of an advanced

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.440 
because this is somewhat of an advanced
step<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.860> most<00:01:23.100> of<00:01:23.250> you<00:01:23.369> will<00:01:23.580> forward<00:01:24.000> easily

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
step the most of you will forward easily

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.090 
step the most of you will forward easily
but<00:01:25.140> the<00:01:25.259> catch<00:01:25.439> is<00:01:25.470> is<00:01:25.740> when<00:01:25.890> you<00:01:26.009> will

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
but the catch is is when you will

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.179 
but the catch is is when you will
elliptical<00:01:26.790> off<00:01:27.000> and<00:01:27.330> you<00:01:27.450> push<00:01:28.189> again

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
elliptical off and you push again

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.240 
elliptical off and you push again
