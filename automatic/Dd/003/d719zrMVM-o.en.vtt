about specific makes and models of gear
we're<00:00:09.719> just<00:00:09.840> gonna<00:00:09.960> be<00:00:10.050> talking<00:00:10.170> about<00:00:10.349> the

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
we're just gonna be talking about the

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:11.780 
we're just gonna be talking about the
pieces<00:00:11.040> of<00:00:11.130> equipment<00:00:11.250> that<00:00:11.490> you<00:00:11.639> actually

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
pieces of equipment that you actually

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.940 
pieces of equipment that you actually
need<00:00:12.120> to<00:00:12.150> start<00:00:12.570> on<00:00:12.750> a<00:00:12.780> very<00:00:13.080> basic<00:00:13.259> mobile<00:00:13.769> DJ

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
need to start on a very basic mobile DJ

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.220 
need to start on a very basic mobile DJ
setup<00:00:14.309> so<00:00:14.910> let's<00:00:15.059> start<00:00:15.269> off<00:00:15.360> with<00:00:15.599> audio<00:00:15.990> gear

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
setup so let's start off with audio gear

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.410 
setup so let's start off with audio gear
firstly<00:00:17.130> you'll<00:00:17.250> speak<00:00:17.490> system<00:00:17.880> you<00:00:18.119> got<00:00:18.240> two

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
firstly you'll speak system you got two

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.269 
firstly you'll speak system you got two
options<00:00:18.510> here<00:00:18.930> active<00:00:19.710> which<00:00:19.949> basically

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
options here active which basically

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:21.740 
options here active which basically
means<00:00:20.580> that<00:00:20.760> the<00:00:20.850> amplifier<00:00:21.510> for<00:00:21.630> your

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
means that the amplifier for your

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:22.970 
means that the amplifier for your
speakers<00:00:22.140> is<00:00:22.320> built<00:00:22.560> into<00:00:22.769> the<00:00:22.859> actual

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
speakers is built into the actual

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.400 
speakers is built into the actual
speaker<00:00:23.279> cabinets<00:00:23.789> or<00:00:24.240> passive<00:00:24.930> which<00:00:25.230> is

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
speaker cabinets or passive which is

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:26.390 
speaker cabinets or passive which is
where<00:00:25.560> you<00:00:25.619> have<00:00:25.680> an<00:00:25.830> external<00:00:26.130> amplifier

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
where you have an external amplifier

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.120 
where you have an external amplifier
powering<00:00:27.330> your<00:00:27.449> speaker's<00:00:27.869> usually<00:00:28.830> you<00:00:28.980> have

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
powering your speaker's usually you have

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.710 
powering your speaker's usually you have
two<00:00:29.369> speakers<00:00:29.609> either<00:00:30.060> side<00:00:30.240> of<00:00:30.269> your<00:00:30.449> DJ

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
two speakers either side of your DJ

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.600 
two speakers either side of your DJ
console<00:00:31.109> it's<00:00:31.619> a<00:00:31.710> good<00:00:31.890> idea<00:00:32.009> to<00:00:32.279> have<00:00:32.369> them<00:00:32.460> up

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
console it's a good idea to have them up

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.340 
console it's a good idea to have them up
on<00:00:32.790> tripod<00:00:33.239> so<00:00:33.390> the<00:00:33.480> sound<00:00:33.719> travels<00:00:33.989> a<00:00:34.200> lot

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
on tripod so the sound travels a lot

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:35.930 
on tripod so the sound travels a lot
further<00:00:34.590> around<00:00:34.800> the<00:00:34.950> room<00:00:35.130> if<00:00:35.610> you<00:00:35.700> have<00:00:35.820> them

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
further around the room if you have them

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.370 
further around the room if you have them
down<00:00:36.059> on<00:00:36.210> the<00:00:36.300> floor<00:00:36.540> and<00:00:36.600> it<00:00:36.870> sounds<00:00:37.079> do<00:00:37.230> gonna

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
down on the floor and it sounds do gonna

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:38.810 
down on the floor and it sounds do gonna
hit<00:00:37.680> the<00:00:37.800> front<00:00:37.950> of<00:00:38.100> your<00:00:38.219> audience<00:00:38.520> and<00:00:38.670> is

lighting<00:01:48.270> needs<00:01:48.570> a<00:01:48.659> bit<00:01:48.750> more<00:01:48.899> difficult<00:01:49.290> to

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
lighting needs a bit more difficult to

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.569 
lighting needs a bit more difficult to
describe<00:01:49.740> because<00:01:49.979> there<00:01:50.220> aren't<00:01:50.460> specific

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
describe because there aren't specific

types<00:01:51.270> of<00:01:51.479> lights<00:01:51.720> you<00:01:51.869> need<00:01:51.990> to<00:01:52.110> have<00:01:52.259> I'm

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
types of lights you need to have I'm

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.469 
types of lights you need to have I'm
going<00:01:52.890> to<00:01:52.950> cover<00:01:53.100> a<00:01:53.220> few<00:01:53.490> types<00:01:53.970> of<00:01:54.240> lighting

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
going to cover a few types of lighting

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.569 
going to cover a few types of lighting
in<00:01:54.689> a<00:01:54.750> second<00:01:55.140> but<00:01:55.710> I<00:01:55.740> find<00:01:56.040> lighting<00:01:56.399> to<00:01:56.490> be

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
in a second but I find lighting to be

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:57.980 
in a second but I find lighting to be
the<00:01:56.700> more<00:01:56.850> creative<00:01:57.270> side<00:01:57.420> of<00:01:57.479> things<00:01:57.810> when

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
the more creative side of things when

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.450 
the more creative side of things when
you<00:01:58.079> design<00:01:58.439> your<00:01:58.619> light<00:01:58.829> show<00:01:59.100> and<00:01:59.250> you<00:01:59.310> make

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
you design your light show and you make

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:00.830 
you design your light show and you make
the<00:01:59.579> most<00:01:59.729> effective<00:02:00.149> light<00:02:00.299> show<00:02:00.509> you<00:02:00.600> can

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
the most effective light show you can

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.450 
the most effective light show you can
while<00:02:01.290> still<00:02:01.320> keeping<00:02:01.710> it<00:02:01.950> nice<00:02:02.070> and<00:02:02.130> compact

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
while still keeping it nice and compact

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.490 
while still keeping it nice and compact
now<00:02:03.360> there<00:02:03.509> are<00:02:03.630> loads<00:02:03.869> and<00:02:04.079> loads<00:02:04.170> of

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
that you can use a smoke machine there's

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:57.860 
that you can use a smoke machine there's
lots<00:02:56.579> of<00:02:56.639> different<00:02:56.879> ways<00:02:56.970> you<00:02:57.030> can<00:02:57.359> rig<00:02:57.659> your

00:03:05.149 --> 00:03:05.159 
up from the floor and then you can also

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:07.309 
up from the floor and then you can also
have<00:03:05.280> things<00:03:05.519> like<00:03:05.700> deck<00:03:06.689> stands<00:03:07.019> with

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
just attach your lights straight on to

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.720 
just attach your lights straight on to
your<00:03:12.209> speaker<00:03:12.569> stand<00:03:12.930> or<00:03:13.290> the<00:03:14.069> most<00:03:14.250> simple<00:03:14.609> is

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
your speaker stand or the most simple is

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.479 
your speaker stand or the most simple is
just<00:03:15.060> a<00:03:15.239> basic<00:03:15.450> t-bar<00:03:16.159> controlling<00:03:17.159> of<00:03:17.250> lights

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
just a basic t-bar controlling of lights

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:18.860 
just a basic t-bar controlling of lights
it's<00:03:17.730> also<00:03:17.849> something<00:03:18.120> important<00:03:18.690> you<00:03:18.750> need

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
it's also something important you need

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.140 
it's also something important you need
to<00:03:18.989> consider<00:03:19.260> now<00:03:19.889> pretty<00:03:20.069> much<00:03:20.220> all<00:03:20.430> mobile

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
DJ lights that you'll buy out there have

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.770 
DJ lights that you'll buy out there have
got<00:03:23.220> sound<00:03:23.489> active<00:03:23.910> which<00:03:24.180> basically<00:03:24.480> means

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
got sound active which basically means

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:26.180 
got sound active which basically means
that<00:03:24.900> the<00:03:25.019> light<00:03:25.260> will<00:03:25.440> respond<00:03:25.769> to<00:03:25.859> the<00:03:25.980> beats

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
that the light will respond to the beats

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:27.830 
that the light will respond to the beats
the<00:03:26.370> music<00:03:26.699> so<00:03:26.879> requires<00:03:27.239> no<00:03:27.569> external

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
the music so requires no external

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.140 
the music so requires no external
control<00:03:28.530> they'll<00:03:28.980> just<00:03:29.190> run<00:03:29.340> themselves<00:03:29.579> and

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
control they'll just run themselves and

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.420 
control they'll just run themselves and
run<00:03:30.359> to<00:03:30.480> the<00:03:30.540> music<00:03:30.840> all<00:03:31.049> that<00:03:31.230> not<00:03:31.440> but<00:03:32.280> if<00:03:32.370> you

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
run to the music all that not but if you

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:33.680 
run to the music all that not but if you
want<00:03:32.549> to<00:03:32.609> get<00:03:32.730> a<00:03:32.760> bit<00:03:32.879> more<00:03:33.030> advanced<00:03:33.299> a<00:03:33.480> bit

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
want to get a bit more advanced a bit

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:35.569 
want to get a bit more advanced a bit
more<00:03:33.810> control<00:03:34.139> you<00:03:34.650> can<00:03:34.859> use<00:03:35.159> something

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:35.579 
more control you can use something

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:37.789 
more control you can use something
called<00:03:35.669> master<00:03:36.239> slave<00:03:36.510> which<00:03:37.169> basically<00:03:37.470> you

00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:37.799 
called master slave which basically you

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:39.500 
called master slave which basically you
set<00:03:38.010> one<00:03:38.220> unit<00:03:38.519> is<00:03:38.579> the<00:03:38.669> master<00:03:39.120> and<00:03:39.299> one<00:03:39.419> of

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
set one unit is the master and one of

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:40.970 
set one unit is the master and one of
the<00:03:39.629> slave<00:03:39.900> you<00:03:40.169> connect<00:03:40.500> them<00:03:40.590> together<00:03:40.709> and

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
the slave you connect them together and

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.699 
the slave you connect them together and
via<00:03:41.159> DMX<00:03:41.489> cable<00:03:42.090> and<00:03:42.269> DMX<00:03:42.900> cable<00:03:43.260> look<00:03:43.409> is<00:03:43.560> that

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
via DMX cable and DMX cable look is that

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:45.920 
via DMX cable and DMX cable look is that
they<00:03:43.829> like<00:03:43.949> XLR<00:03:44.400> cable<00:03:44.790> it's<00:03:45.030> three<00:03:45.359> pin<00:03:45.599> can

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
they like XLR cable it's three pin can

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:47.750 
they like XLR cable it's three pin can
be<00:03:45.959> five<00:03:46.290> pin<00:03:46.560> but<00:03:47.010> it's<00:03:47.129> the<00:03:47.220> signal<00:03:47.579> cable

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
be five pin but it's the signal cable

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:51.259 
be five pin but it's the signal cable
that<00:03:48.060> takes<00:03:48.900> a<00:03:49.109> lighting<00:03:49.889> control<00:03:50.280> signal<00:03:50.669> so

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:51.269 
that takes a lighting control signal so

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:53.000 
that takes a lighting control signal so
you've<00:03:51.389> set<00:03:51.510> it<00:03:51.540> up<00:03:51.750> connected<00:03:52.229> via<00:03:52.349> DMX<00:03:52.590> what

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
you've set it up connected via DMX what

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:54.559 
you've set it up connected via DMX what
if<00:03:53.099> the<00:03:53.190> master<00:03:53.609> one<00:03:53.819> is<00:03:53.940> the<00:03:54.030> slave<00:03:54.269> and<00:03:54.510> the

00:03:54.559 --> 00:03:54.569 
if the master one is the slave and the

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:57.020 
if the master one is the slave and the
slave<00:03:54.840> will<00:03:54.930> copy<00:03:55.199> what<00:03:55.739> the<00:03:55.859> master<00:03:56.220> does<00:03:56.400> you

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
slave will copy what the master does you

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:58.550 
slave will copy what the master does you
can<00:03:57.150> also<00:03:57.299> get<00:03:57.479> things<00:03:57.720> like<00:03:57.959> the<00:03:58.079> uc3

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
can also get things like the uc3

00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:59.990 
can also get things like the uc3
controller<00:03:58.949> which<00:03:59.159> allow<00:03:59.400> you<00:03:59.459> to<00:03:59.669> control

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
controller which allow you to control

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.089

basic<00:04:00.510> parameters<00:04:00.959> of<00:04:00.989> lights<00:04:01.260> but<00:04:01.979> if<00:04:02.069> you

00:04:02.089 --> 00:04:02.099 
basic parameters of lights but if you

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:03.469 
basic parameters of lights but if you
want<00:04:02.250> to<00:04:02.310> go<00:04:02.370> really<00:04:02.639> advanced<00:04:02.940> you<00:04:03.239> can<00:04:03.359> go

00:04:03.469 --> 00:04:03.479 
want to go really advanced you can go

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:05.659 
want to go really advanced you can go
