I'll do the figures later on other ones
dial<00:00:50.850> is<00:00:50.970> pretty<00:00:51.150> mediocre<00:00:51.330> I<00:00:51.869> mean<00:00:52.019> 475

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:52.589 
dial is pretty mediocre I mean 475

dial is pretty mediocre I mean 475
points<00:00:52.949> you<00:00:53.489> get<00:00:53.729> some<00:00:54.540> enhancement<00:00:55.199> and<00:00:55.350> a

00:00:55.969 --> 00:00:55.979

little<00:00:56.369> bit<00:00:56.460> of<00:00:56.489> perplex<00:00:57.470> it's<00:00:58.470> a<00:00:58.650> ship<00:00:58.890> that

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
little bit of perplex it's a ship that

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.710 
little bit of perplex it's a ship that
can<00:00:59.220> regenerate<00:01:00.979> kind<00:01:01.979> of<00:01:02.070> nifty<00:01:02.720> interesting

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:03.720 
can regenerate kind of nifty interesting

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:06.350 
can regenerate kind of nifty interesting
to<00:01:03.960> say<00:01:04.140> the<00:01:04.170> least<00:01:04.700> not<00:01:05.700> a<00:01:05.729> whole<00:01:05.970> lot<00:01:06.119> there

click of that rub running shot and

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.440 
click of that rub running shot and
that's<00:01:13.170> really<00:01:13.560> about<00:01:13.740> it<00:01:14.299> um<00:01:16.130> toughness

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:17.450 
that's really about it um toughness

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:21.020 
that's really about it um toughness
that's<00:01:18.450> really<00:01:18.900> not<00:01:19.110> that<00:01:19.350> much<00:01:19.610> there's<00:01:20.610> two

that's really not that much there's two
clicks<00:01:21.330> of<00:01:21.450> regeneration<00:01:22.020> so<00:01:22.470> it's<00:01:23.280> not<00:01:23.429> too

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
clicks of regeneration so it's not too

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.929 
clicks of regeneration so it's not too
terrible<00:01:24.420> only<00:01:25.380> six<00:01:25.829> it's<00:01:26.130> basically<00:01:26.700> you've

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
see how things turn out these are really

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.050 
see how things turn out these are really
built<00:01:45.359> to<00:01:45.509> have<00:01:45.689> their<00:01:45.869> own<00:01:45.899> tournament<00:01:46.350> and

that's what they've done a lot is
there's<00:01:49.170> actual<00:01:49.530> price<00:01:49.799> support<00:01:50.189> for<00:01:50.280> these

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
there's actual price support for these

it's<00:02:12.780> one<00:02:12.930> of<00:02:13.020> the<00:02:13.080> I<00:02:13.290> think<00:02:13.350> it's<00:02:13.590> a<00:02:13.680> deep

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
it's one of the I think it's a deep

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.280 
it's one of the I think it's a deep
space<00:02:14.100> 9<00:02:14.340> ship<00:02:14.700> here's<00:02:15.540> the<00:02:15.630> dial<00:02:15.840> this<00:02:16.080> one's

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
space 9 ship here's the dial this one's

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.770 
space 9 ship here's the dial this one's
a<00:02:16.350> little<00:02:16.620> bit<00:02:16.830> more<00:02:16.950> useful<00:02:18.080> let's<00:02:19.080> see<00:02:19.470> here

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
a little bit more useful let's see here

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:22.820 
a little bit more useful let's see here
some<00:02:21.780> of<00:02:21.840> the<00:02:21.930> powers<00:02:22.230> are<00:02:22.350> kind<00:02:22.560> of<00:02:22.620> out<00:02:22.800> of

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
some of the powers are kind of out of

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.550 
some of the powers are kind of out of
the<00:02:23.010> out<00:02:23.459> of<00:02:23.640> the<00:02:23.670> water<00:02:24.000> here<00:02:24.569> looks<00:02:25.380> like

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
the out of the water here looks like

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.149 
the out of the water here looks like
there's<00:02:25.770> energy<00:02:26.040> shield<00:02:26.490> and<00:02:26.640> deflection

00:02:28.149 --> 00:02:28.159 
there's energy shield and deflection

00:02:28.159 --> 00:02:31.729 
there's energy shield and deflection
perhaps<00:02:29.159> I'm<00:02:29.549> not<00:02:30.019> way<00:02:31.019> too<00:02:31.080> sure<00:02:31.379> about<00:02:31.409> the

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:31.739 
perhaps I'm not way too sure about the

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:32.750 
perhaps I'm not way too sure about the
colors<00:02:32.099> there

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
colors there

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.410 
colors there
looks<00:02:33.180> like<00:02:33.299> incapacitate<00:02:34.110> almost<00:02:34.700> a<00:02:35.700> little

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
looks like incapacitate almost a little

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:41.030 
looks like incapacitate almost a little
strange<00:02:36.900> a<00:02:37.230> little<00:02:37.610> strange<00:02:39.860> got<00:02:40.860> some

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
strange a little strange got some

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.649 
strange a little strange got some
leadership<00:02:41.370> there<00:02:41.790> that's<00:02:42.030> not<00:02:42.180> too<00:02:42.450> bad<00:02:42.480> i

00:02:42.649 --> 00:02:42.659 
leadership there that's not too bad i

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:44.960 
leadership there that's not too bad i
mean<00:02:42.959> you<00:02:43.079> can<00:02:43.230> use<00:02:43.379> that<00:02:43.530> 425<00:02:44.340> points<00:02:44.640> it's

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
mean you can use that 425 points it's

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.479 
mean you can use that 425 points it's
really<00:02:45.269> not<00:02:45.390> too<00:02:45.689> bad<00:02:45.959> got<00:02:46.230> some<00:02:46.890> probability

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
really not too bad got some probability

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:50.539 
really not too bad got some probability
control<00:02:47.909> and<00:02:48.030> that's<00:02:48.409> that's<00:02:49.409> darn<00:02:49.829> useful<00:02:50.310> I

00:02:50.539 --> 00:02:50.549 
control and that's that's darn useful I

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:52.190

don't care what anybody says anything
with<00:02:52.680> probability<00:02:53.159> control<00:02:53.489> is<00:02:53.730> okay<00:02:54.060> in<00:02:54.180> my

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
with probability control is okay in my

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.600 
with probability control is okay in my
book<00:02:54.680> although<00:02:55.680> this<00:02:55.829> is<00:02:56.010> a<00:02:56.040> ship<00:02:56.400> that's

00:02:59.539 --> 00:02:59.549 
going to get destroyed looks like it

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:03.979 
going to get destroyed looks like it
might<00:02:59.790> withstand<00:03:00.359> a<00:03:00.510> little<00:03:00.840> bit<00:03:01.019> they're<00:03:02.989> not

stealth too so especially on the Star
Trek<00:04:25.889> maps<00:04:26.159> I<00:04:26.340> think<00:04:26.580> you'll<00:04:26.699> be<00:04:26.849> pretty

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.060 
Trek maps I think you'll be pretty

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:29.120

impressed<00:04:27.360> with<00:04:27.599> how<00:04:27.720> well<00:04:27.750> this<00:04:28.260> ship<00:04:28.889> will

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:29.130 
impressed with how well this ship will

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:33.649 
impressed with how well this ship will
actually<00:04:29.580> maneuver<00:04:29.880> around<00:04:32.210> it's<00:04:33.210> okay

00:04:33.649 --> 00:04:33.659 
actually maneuver around it's okay

00:04:33.659 --> 00:04:36.110 
actually maneuver around it's okay
obviously<00:04:34.340> Superman<00:04:35.340> is<00:04:35.370> going<00:04:35.639> to<00:04:35.699> go<00:04:35.820> up<00:04:35.849> and

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.120 
obviously Superman is going to go up and

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:39.080 
obviously Superman is going to go up and
destroy<00:04:36.599> it<00:04:36.630> but<00:04:37.080> you<00:04:37.380> know<00:04:37.470> you<00:04:37.800> know<00:04:38.789> what

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.090 
destroy it but you know you know what

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:40.339 
destroy it but you know you know what
university<00:04:39.630> you<00:04:39.690> gotta<00:04:39.840> have<00:04:39.960> you<00:04:40.169> know

just<00:04:44.760> doesn't<00:04:45.060> it<00:04:45.330> just<00:04:45.479> doesn't<00:04:45.810> happen

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:46.440 
just doesn't it just doesn't happen

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:48.350 
just doesn't it just doesn't happen
think<00:04:46.590> that's<00:04:46.740> why<00:04:46.890> they're<00:04:47.760> not<00:04:47.910> going<00:04:48.060> to<00:04:48.120> do

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:48.360 
think that's why they're not going to do

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:52.040 
think that's why they're not going to do
Star<00:04:49.230> Trek<00:04:49.470> actual<00:04:50.340> figures<00:04:50.730> I<00:04:51.030> don't<00:04:51.840> think

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:52.050 
Star Trek actual figures I don't think

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:53.660 
Star Trek actual figures I don't think
they're<00:04:52.170> going<00:04:52.260> to<00:04:52.320> be<00:04:52.440> actual<00:04:52.860> people<00:04:53.100> I<00:04:53.460> mean

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:53.670 
they're going to be actual people I mean

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:55.370 
they're going to be actual people I mean
they've<00:04:53.790> done<00:04:53.970> a<00:04:54.000> set<00:04:54.360> the<00:04:54.540> expedition<00:04:55.140> said

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:55.380 
they've done a set the expedition said

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:57.430 
they've done a set the expedition said
but<00:04:55.560> I<00:04:55.590> don't<00:04:55.800> think<00:04:55.950> they're<00:04:56.130> going<00:04:56.220> to<00:04:56.310> do<00:04:56.460> a

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:57.440 
but I don't think they're going to do a

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:00.560 
but I don't think they're going to do a
heroclix<00:04:58.440> compatible<00:04:59.100> set<00:04:59.340> just<00:05:00.270> because

heroclix compatible set just because

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:02.240 
heroclix compatible set just because
