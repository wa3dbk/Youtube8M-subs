 they multiply 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.040
 no sleeping no chalon and mezin parquet it does not sleep more staggering 

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:14.129
 event on 4500 square meters recreationland and its 26 structures 

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:18.150
 Inflatable wooden games video games for small and big and 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:19.909
 discovered at the same time 

00:00:19.909 --> 00:00:22.939
 for children fairy and wooden games 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:25.929
 and I think it's very interesting we did things that 

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:28.949
 even I have never seen so I discover by setting fire to 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.379
 new games the principle of inflatable structures parkas is not a 

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:37.390
 unknown in the middle of the proposed booth - a space that the exhibition grounds 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:40.590
 there we propose to the public of the agglomeration and more broadly to 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:41.050
 wood 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.480
 a festival of these playful structures with as I told you 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.520
 structures that are very very beautiful that are very big you have a lot of 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.129
 new things that we can not find here and it's a highlight 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.879
 precisely because we expect departure of attraction of gold we value 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.449
 finally a little it does not happen and we hope that it can serve 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.190
 dad recognize a little bit better even 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:02.630
 The fact that the starting observation the attraction one year in the agglomeration 

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:07.170
 enters the 83rd Recreationland was conceived a few years ago in 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.070
 the west of France with the idea of ​​offering distractions for children 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.200
 and parent 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.720
 - TV sets and game consoles that's what we try 

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:19.469
 to develop through our speech for via the structure supervisors 

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:21.720
 it was parents get involved in the game too 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.820
 we will encourage parents to see them with children in the game what we 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:27.780
 wants to give back a little dynamism you know to make sure that 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:28.310
 the parents 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.200
 the children the grandparents they find themselves around the game 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.740
 passersby as a whole tjx the parties of the recreation center of 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.650
 sainte-marie he came with a dozen children from 4 to 8 years 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:41.880
 the picnics are in the backpacks and the party lasted the entire 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.220
 day 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:46.350
 we can so here 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.200
 first because the next generation 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.500
 the face-to-face has sometimes been put on sale for free to increase the 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.310
 number of job losses and 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:57.880
 we are still more pleased to take the voice of America to 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.270
 several children 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:04.200
 but as soon as we told them we would come with every day 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.460
 the eternal feminine is marion of live poultry 

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:12.489
 for good fun and I think tonight's defeat there are several 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:15.770
 suicides and appendices what to tell parents until night 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:19.680
