00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:05.000 
so if you need to test some glow plugs

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.960 
so if you need to test some glow plugs
from<00:00:06.000> a<00:00:06.060> diesel<00:00:06.420> engine<00:00:07.580> it's<00:00:08.580> pretty<00:00:08.820> easy

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
from a diesel engine it's pretty easy

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:15.499 
from a diesel engine it's pretty easy
just<00:00:09.269> take<00:00:09.480> them<00:00:09.660> out<00:00:11.059> get<00:00:12.059> some<00:00:14.509> 12-volt

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
just take them out get some 12-volt

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:21.260 
just take them out get some 12-volt
leads<00:00:15.809> from<00:00:16.800> a<00:00:16.890> battery<00:00:17.310> and<00:00:18.680> the<00:00:20.270> negative

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
leads from a battery and the negative

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:28.870 
leads from a battery and the negative
lead<00:00:22.340> connect<00:00:24.199> to<00:00:26.449> some<00:00:27.449> of<00:00:27.599> this<00:00:27.779> bare<00:00:28.289> metal

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:28.880 
lead connect to some of this bare metal

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:35.840 
lead connect to some of this bare metal
part<00:00:29.880> and<00:00:31.250> the<00:00:32.250> positive<00:00:32.730> lead<00:00:34.850> gets

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
part and the positive lead gets

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:42.590 
part and the positive lead gets
connected<00:00:36.390> to<00:00:36.570> this<00:00:36.780> top<00:00:39.710> threaded<00:00:40.710> part<00:00:41.600> it

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
connected to this top threaded part it

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.540 
connected to this top threaded part it
should<00:00:42.750> glow<00:00:43.110> red<00:00:43.379> in<00:00:43.559> about<00:00:43.770> eight<00:00:43.980> seconds

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
should glow red in about eight seconds

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:53.569 
should glow red in about eight seconds
for<00:00:45.270> this<00:00:46.250> particular<00:00:47.250> plug<00:00:52.370> you<00:00:53.370> can<00:00:53.399> see

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
for this particular plug you can see

00:00:53.579 --> 00:01:01.899 
for this particular plug you can see
some<00:00:53.789> smoke<00:00:54.090> coming<00:00:54.149> off

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:01.909 

00:01:01.909 --> 00:01:17.779 

star<00:01:02.909> in<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.120> gloves<00:01:16.460> so<00:01:17.460> that's<00:01:17.640> how<00:01:17.700> you

00:01:17.779 --> 00:01:17.789 
star in the gloves so that's how you

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:19.670 
star in the gloves so that's how you
test<00:01:17.939> the<00:01:18.060> glow<00:01:18.210> plugs<00:01:18.450> just<00:01:19.350> makes<00:01:19.500> you<00:01:19.560> add

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
test the glow plugs just makes you add

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.690 
test the glow plugs just makes you add
like<00:01:19.890> a<00:01:19.920> piece<00:01:20.130> of<00:01:20.280> metal<00:01:20.580> or<00:01:21.500> a<00:01:22.500> like<00:01:23.369> stone

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
like a piece of metal or a like stone

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.749 
like a piece of metal or a like stone
ground<00:01:24.060> to<00:01:24.240> put<00:01:24.420> them<00:01:24.539> down<00:01:24.750> on<00:01:25.670> and<00:01:26.670> don't

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
ground to put them down on and don't

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.969 
ground to put them down on and don't
touch<00:01:27.320> anywhere<00:01:28.320> on<00:01:28.380> the<00:01:28.500> bottom<00:01:28.830> with<00:01:28.950> your

touch anywhere on the bottom with your
fingers<00:01:30.679> tops<00:01:31.679> going<00:01:31.890> to<00:01:31.950> be<00:01:32.009> pretty<00:01:32.220> hot<00:01:32.399> too

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
fingers tops going to be pretty hot too

00:01:32.610 --> 00:02:05.230 
fingers tops going to be pretty hot too
so<00:01:35.390> we'll<00:01:36.390> do<00:01:36.539> this<00:01:36.690> one<00:01:36.750> see<00:01:37.530> if<00:01:37.619> it<00:01:37.709> works

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.490 

see<00:02:06.240> that<00:02:06.390> melt<00:02:06.600> of<00:02:06.720> a<00:02:06.810> plastic<00:02:07.260> a<00:02:07.350> little<00:02:07.560> bit

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500 
see that melt of a plastic a little bit

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.790 
see that melt of a plastic a little bit
and<00:02:10.500> so<00:02:11.039> yeah<00:02:11.160> that's<00:02:11.459> how<00:02:11.550> you<00:02:11.670> do
