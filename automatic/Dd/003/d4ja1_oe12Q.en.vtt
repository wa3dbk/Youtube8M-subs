top-of-the-line

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.830 
top-of-the-line
so<00:00:32.640> I<00:00:32.669> thought<00:00:32.910> it'd<00:00:33.000> be<00:00:33.030> pretty<00:00:33.120> cool<00:00:33.570> to<00:00:33.780> have

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
so I thought it'd be pretty cool to have

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.900 
so I thought it'd be pretty cool to have
a<00:00:34.350> simplified<00:00:34.860> version<00:00:35.100> of<00:00:35.430> it<00:00:35.550> so<00:00:35.579> there's

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
a simplified version of it so there's

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.450 
a simplified version of it so there's
the<00:00:36.030> standard<00:00:36.420> okay<00:00:36.899> and<00:00:37.469> the<00:00:37.680> standard<00:00:38.129> comes

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
the standard okay and the standard comes

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.369 
the standard okay and the standard comes
in<00:00:38.610> two<00:00:38.760> versions<00:00:39.000> we<00:00:39.480> have<00:00:39.510> the<00:00:39.840> stop<00:00:40.110> tail

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
in two versions we have the stop tail

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.139 
in two versions we have the stop tail
piece<00:00:40.680> and<00:00:41.460> we<00:00:42.270> have<00:00:42.480> the<00:00:42.660> Bigsby<00:00:43.050> b7<00:00:43.710> and<00:00:44.149> the

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
piece and we have the Bigsby b7 and the

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.029 
piece and we have the Bigsby b7 and the
differences<00:00:45.660> between<00:00:45.870> the<00:00:46.140> two<00:00:46.320> would<00:00:46.800> mainly

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
differences between the two would mainly

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.250 
differences between the two would mainly
be<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.489> rosewood<00:00:48.000> fingerboard<00:00:48.180> dot<00:00:48.840> inlay

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
be the rosewood fingerboard dot inlay

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.729 
be the rosewood fingerboard dot inlay
the<00:00:49.850> headstock<00:00:50.850> is<00:00:51.030> not<00:00:51.180> bound<00:00:51.510> it's<00:00:52.500> not<00:00:52.710> a

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
the headstock is not bound it's not a

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.520 
the headstock is not bound it's not a
gloss<00:00:53.039> finish<00:00:53.070> it's<00:00:53.699> a<00:00:53.789> satin<00:00:54.149> finish

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:54.530 
gloss finish it's a satin finish

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:59.029 
gloss finish it's a satin finish
it's<00:00:55.530> a<00:00:55.710> poly<00:00:55.980> so<00:00:56.550> it's<00:00:56.940> a<00:00:57.149> lot<00:00:57.469> simplified<00:00:58.469> and

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
it's a poly so it's a lot simplified and

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.330 
it's a poly so it's a lot simplified and
cheaper

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:00.340 
cheaper

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:02.400 
cheaper
and<00:01:00.640> it's<00:01:00.880> more<00:01:01.090> of<00:01:01.120> a<00:01:01.210> player<00:01:01.420> and<00:01:01.720> the<00:01:02.110> new

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:02.410 
and it's more of a player and the new

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:05.040 
and it's more of a player and the new
