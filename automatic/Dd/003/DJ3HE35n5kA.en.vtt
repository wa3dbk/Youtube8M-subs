00:00:12.409 --> 00:00:16.119
 the idea initially was to keep track of what citroën had done 

00:00:16.679 --> 00:00:19.369
 citizens who really mark atypical 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:21.800
 in this case the museum preserve 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.359
 all those cars that were really exceptional and that came out of 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.899
 national and even international production 

00:00:26.899 --> 00:00:30.970
 and so we had to keep track before everything was forgotten because these 

00:00:30.969 --> 00:00:32.440
 cars end of course 

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:35.800
 so the common thread this helps find exceptional vehicles 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:37.570
 very close to new 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:39.680
 shortly after leaving the factory 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.680
 b and keep them in their original state 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.440
 many are planned begins 40 the state so after the war 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.610
 at the exit of the tube and daily show 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.660
 and that ends with the redemption of pork the day without 174 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:01.980
 for those who have shows of 54 that is to say the type art 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.520
 popol who passed the smallest motor it's there underboot that was 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:06.350
 designed 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.840
 36 min 48 and marketed in October 48 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.000
 exciting titah why because 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.540
 everything is simpler than the two shows that come after and very very hard 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:19.430
 to find because in general they are they evolved they were 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:20.149
 modified 

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:22.560
 and that's exceptional because the absolut mango 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.600
 totally original ariane has been transformed and its mileage that is 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.600
 7000 km is also exceptional 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:33.580
 the museum particularity one tries to keep vehicles with 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:35.190
 very low mileage 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:37.450
 very close to new with foreign clubs 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:39.840
 around 20 thousand kilometers 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.210
 and vehicles keep in their state 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:46.610
 as an exit from the zune to have this trace of what citroën realized 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:48.220
 the time 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:50.940
 facing this exceptional car since 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:54.730
 Greece was released in 2011 to 5000 copies this is the number of 

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:56.130
 chassis 32 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.490
 and the very first of the seven years the number 19 is the 14th goddess 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:00.310
 built 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:02.640
 and at that moment the cars were assembled entirely by hand 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.440
 you must know about a Greek goddess twelve thousand pieces 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:08.749
 in a room fully assembled by 250 people 

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:12.459
 the chains arrived in february 56 we are in october 55 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:14.949
 the first car sold 

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:17.449
 it's October 6, 55 at the show 

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:20.159
 the first hour 850 cars sold 

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:23.230
 at the end of the day 12 thousand cars sold at the end of the show 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:24.929
 eighty thousand cars 

00:02:24.929 --> 00:02:27.119
 and his car is a survivor 

00:02:27.119 --> 00:02:29.529
 these are the words of his c30 of this exceptional 

00:02:29.529 --> 00:02:32.439
 everyone in the room knows this car, especially since his 

00:02:32.439 --> 00:02:33.889
 state is very close to new 

00:02:33.889 --> 00:02:36.369
 in excellent original condition even if it has been repainted 

00:02:36.369 --> 00:02:40.049
 the 69 '1000km of origin she was successively a cancer 

00:02:56.539 --> 00:02:59.909
 these two horses which is 61 years old so that 45 years old today 

00:02:59.909 --> 00:03:02.289
 it only has 1800 km of origin 

00:03:02.289 --> 00:03:05.449
 it is said that the branch preserve them in its state since the lady who had 

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:06.609
 bought this car 

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:10.389
 the devout guardian of man did quite what was needed to keep the 

00:03:10.389 --> 00:03:11.629
 video on the seats 

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:14.679
 he had mud are only for now to protect him 

00:03:14.679 --> 00:03:16.379
 everything was ready to do the same and 

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:19.050
 children that wants to put their feet on him 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:20.370
 the back bar 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:23.259
 the friend of the chatterton to try to protect them 

00:03:23.259 --> 00:03:26.549
 this spirit there we still find since it was a nurse under 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:29.249
 the floor mats that was protected 

00:03:29.249 --> 00:03:32.239
 no more no less recovered at work this was the case yesterday 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:34.409
 to avoid damaging the floor mats 

00:03:34.409 --> 00:03:37.739
 all that exciting thing is folded an otaku people were doing 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:40.719
 watch what he experienced was more than a video of savings 

00:03:40.719 --> 00:03:43.279
 and we had to preserve what we had bought we had done a lot of 

00:03:43.279 --> 00:03:45.319
 sacrifices to get a car 

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:48.319
 which is no longer the case today 

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:53.389
 so this is a very long study work vanden borre just 

00:03:53.389 --> 00:03:55.810
 crossed the France of France in every sense 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:57.849
 I made thousands of people believe me 

00:03:57.849 --> 00:03:59.969
 asking them the client files for me 

00:03:59.969 --> 00:04:00.919
 find 

00:04:00.919 --> 00:04:03.739
 car owners 

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:07.069
 all means are good advertising of course word-of-mouth a 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:09.909
 network of friends that allowed me to find vehicles faster 

00:04:09.909 --> 00:04:13.079
 that certain professionals of the branch who could have 

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:15.329
 bidding will go into cars 

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:18.489
 so all means are good to find exceptional keys pay 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:19.570
 you have to be fast 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:22.570
 a hole 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:26.820
 ap ap ap ap ap apple must not make the shot appear for m 

00:04:27.469 --> 00:04:29.689
 not always looking for vehicles 

00:04:29.689 --> 00:04:32.689
 original restore it with very low mileage 

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:35.949
 I found this war is the most beautiful and very early 

00:04:35.949 --> 00:04:39.150
 because if laurent but we miss next so we have to be the first 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:42.150
 like quebec, you have to shoot as fast as you can 

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:48.499
 where there is a built 1365 convertible 

00:04:48.499 --> 00:04:50.050
 by henry chapron 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:54.039
 often from a factory so called kids and cousins ​​so briollay two 

00:04:54.039 --> 00:04:54.840
 series 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:59.430
 B Citroën had delegated himself pro buying which was a great car 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:01.479
 also and especially on high-level cars 

00:05:01.479 --> 00:05:05.180
 and so he had this task of making the serial convertibles 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:10.130
 following the drawing 2 the bertoli engineer who was the stylist the house 

00:05:10.879 --> 00:05:14.770
 it's not a pride if I do not think of greenhouse it's played on it 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:16.900
 it is the passion of the sea it is the pleasure of 

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:20.510
 to find a vehicle to put it back online because even if it only has 

00:05:20.509 --> 00:05:23.749
 50 6000 km there have been a lot of things that have 

00:05:23.749 --> 00:05:26.639
 which have been mixed so we have to take them back to this passion for 

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:27.879
 mechanics on the one hand 

00:05:27.879 --> 00:05:30.889
 and then these vehicles I estimate that it is saved and that now it is put 

00:05:30.889 --> 00:05:34.210
 in value and I make you share to passionate people who come here in the 

00:05:34.209 --> 00:05:36.529
 museum to see things like that pieces that are difficult to 

00:05:36.529 --> 00:05:40.249
 find there are people who come specially to see my cars and 

00:05:40.249 --> 00:05:42.039
 to have a moment of passion 

00:05:42.039 --> 00:05:45.310
 % to share with me and we will see in detail 

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:48.990
 what fascinates us what does not always appear in the books of the cia 

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:51.950
 year but this is where it becomes interesting for them as much as for 

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:53.539
 me it's an exchange 

00:05:53.539 --> 00:05:55.669
 it's not just 

00:05:55.669 --> 00:05:59.680
 someone who is a tale his salad so I'm passionate I like 

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:01.310
 learn things I learn every day
