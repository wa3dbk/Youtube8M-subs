little<00:00:29.970> bit<00:00:30.090> we<00:00:30.240> have<00:00:30.269> here<00:00:30.480> today<00:00:30.599> sure

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:31.730 
little bit we have here today sure

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:35.150 
little bit we have here today sure
what's<00:00:32.730> going<00:00:32.880> on<00:00:33.059> here<00:00:33.360> is<00:00:33.540> we<00:00:34.140> have<00:00:34.170> a<00:00:34.680> model

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
what's going on here is we have a model

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.520 
what's going on here is we have a model
nuclear<00:00:35.520> fusion<00:00:35.730> reactor<00:00:36.149> that<00:00:36.329> works<00:00:36.570> it<00:00:36.840> is

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
nuclear fusion reactor that works it is

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.500 
nuclear fusion reactor that works it is
called<00:00:37.980> the<00:00:38.250> Farnsworth<00:00:38.969> Hirsch<00:00:39.180> fuser

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
called the Farnsworth Hirsch fuser

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.590 
called the Farnsworth Hirsch fuser
invented<00:00:40.290> by<00:00:40.410> Philo<00:00:40.890> T<00:00:40.920> Farnsworth's<00:00:41.579> and<00:00:41.760> it

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
invented by Philo T Farnsworth's and it

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.630 
invented by Philo T Farnsworth's and it
was<00:00:42.780> based<00:00:42.989> off<00:00:43.200> of<00:00:43.230> the<00:00:43.410> multi<00:00:43.770> factor<00:00:44.100> and<00:00:44.309> it

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
was based off of the multi factor and it

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.549 
was based off of the multi factor and it
is<00:00:44.969> just<00:00:45.120> basically<00:00:45.510> device<00:00:45.840> that<00:00:46.140> collides

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
is just basically device that collides

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.130 
is just basically device that collides
atoms<00:00:46.950> and<00:00:47.250> creates<00:00:47.640> a<00:00:47.760> ball<00:00:48.030> of<00:00:48.149> plasma<00:00:48.300> what

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
atoms and creates a ball of plasma what

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.990 
atoms and creates a ball of plasma what
would<00:00:49.289> be<00:00:49.530> readily<00:00:49.770> know<00:00:49.980> today<00:00:50.309> as<00:00:50.340> a<00:00:50.489> star<00:00:50.789> in

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
would be readily know today as a star in

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.900 
would be readily know today as a star in
a<00:00:51.180> jar<00:00:51.420> and<00:00:51.920> what<00:00:52.920> we're<00:00:53.039> doing<00:00:53.070> here<00:00:53.399> is<00:00:53.430> we're

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
a jar and what we're doing here is we're

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.310 
a jar and what we're doing here is we're
taking<00:00:54.030> these<00:00:54.270> fridge<00:00:54.570> compressors<00:00:55.079> and

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
taking these fridge compressors and

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.380 
taking these fridge compressors and
we're<00:00:56.219> plumbing<00:00:56.489> down<00:00:56.640> that<00:00:56.820> chamber<00:00:57.180> to<00:00:57.360> a

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
we're plumbing down that chamber to a

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.569 
we're plumbing down that chamber to a
pressure<00:00:57.629> about<00:00:57.899> of<00:00:58.079> one<00:00:58.410> tour<00:00:58.680> and<00:00:58.920> very<00:00:59.399> few

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
pressure about of one tour and very few

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.540 
pressure about of one tour and very few
maybe<00:00:59.879> three<00:01:00.210> hundred<00:01:00.539> thousand<00:01:00.870> atoms

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:01.550 
maybe three hundred thousand atoms

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:04.520 
maybe three hundred thousand atoms
what's<00:01:02.550> going<00:01:02.760> on<00:01:02.820> is<00:01:03.059> we<00:01:03.329> charge<00:01:03.719> that<00:01:03.989> those

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
what's going on is we charge that those

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.920 
what's going on is we charge that those
grids<00:01:04.799> with<00:01:05.339> this<00:01:05.489> transformer<00:01:06.030> it's<00:01:06.720> two

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
grids with this transformer it's two

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.590 
grids with this transformer it's two
thousand<00:01:07.290> volts<00:01:07.470> at<00:01:07.590> an<00:01:07.740> amp<00:01:07.890> and<00:01:08.159> it<00:01:09.150> produces

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
thousand volts at an amp and it produces

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.420 
thousand volts at an amp and it produces
electromagnetic<00:01:10.350> fields<00:01:10.710> it<00:01:10.860> strips<00:01:11.220> the

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
electromagnetic fields it strips the

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.399 
electromagnetic fields it strips the
electrons<00:01:11.880> and<00:01:12.060> neutrons<00:01:12.420> off<00:01:12.720> of<00:01:13.080> the

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
electrons and neutrons off of the

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.310 
electrons and neutrons off of the
nitrogen<00:01:13.799> atoms<00:01:14.280> which<00:01:14.430> is<00:01:14.549> air<00:01:14.700> and<00:01:15.049> then<00:01:16.049> the

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
nitrogen atoms which is air and then the

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.649 
nitrogen atoms which is air and then the
remaining<00:01:16.619> positive<00:01:17.159> ion<00:01:17.729> is<00:01:17.939> accelerated<00:01:18.600> to

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
remaining positive ion is accelerated to

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.990 
remaining positive ion is accelerated to
the<00:01:18.750> inner<00:01:18.900> grid<00:01:19.170> it<00:01:19.830> collides<00:01:20.310> and<00:01:20.670> it

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
the inner grid it collides and it

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.270 
the inner grid it collides and it
produces<00:01:21.780> the<00:01:22.020> plasma<00:01:22.380> shown<00:01:22.740> on<00:01:22.860> that<00:01:23.009> video

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
produces the plasma shown on that video

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.660 
produces the plasma shown on that video
that<00:01:23.750> is<00:01:24.750> some<00:01:25.110> very<00:01:25.320> impressive<00:01:25.590> stuff<00:01:26.009> so

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
that is some very impressive stuff so

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.249 
that is some very impressive stuff so
what<00:01:27.270> got<00:01:27.360> you<00:01:27.420> interested<00:01:27.750> in<00:01:27.960> nuclear

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
what got you interested in nuclear

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.859 
what got you interested in nuclear
fusion<00:01:28.909> I've<00:01:29.909> been<00:01:30.360> working<00:01:30.630> on<00:01:30.720> this<00:01:30.810> for

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
fusion I've been working on this for

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.050 
fusion I've been working on this for
about<00:01:31.079> a<00:01:31.170> year<00:01:31.470> researching<00:01:31.890> and<00:01:32.280> it<00:01:32.790> was<00:01:32.909> just

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
about a year researching and it was just

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.370 
about a year researching and it was just
a<00:01:33.180> cool<00:01:33.390> thing<00:01:33.630> I'm<00:01:33.780> going<00:01:33.869> to<00:01:33.930> turn<00:01:34.079> this<00:01:34.200> into

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
a cool thing I'm going to turn this into

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.010 
a cool thing I'm going to turn this into
a<00:01:34.470> table<00:01:34.829> lamp<00:01:34.950> when<00:01:35.159> i'm<00:01:35.280> done<00:01:35.430> with<00:01:35.520> it<00:01:35.670> and

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 
a table lamp when i'm done with it and

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.420 
a table lamp when i'm done with it and
it<00:01:37.020> was<00:01:37.409> just<00:01:37.650> it's<00:01:37.829> a<00:01:37.950> really<00:01:38.130> cool<00:01:38.369> really

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
it was just it's a really cool really

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.700 
it was just it's a really cool really
advanced<00:01:39.270> kind<00:01:39.509> of<00:01:39.600> science<00:01:39.930> that<00:01:40.110> is<00:01:40.470> very

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
advanced kind of science that is very

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.609 
advanced kind of science that is very
very<00:01:41.369> interesting<00:01:41.880> and<00:01:42.000> it's<00:01:42.990> based<00:01:43.200> off<00:01:43.350> a

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
very interesting and it's based off a

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.219 
very interesting and it's based off a
power<00:01:44.009> source<00:01:44.310> like<00:01:44.640> our<00:01:44.909> main<00:01:45.659> project<00:01:46.110> was

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
power source like our main project was

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.130 
power source like our main project was
designed<00:01:46.560> over<00:01:47.310> the<00:01:47.579> fact<00:01:48.060> that<00:01:48.180> if<00:01:48.450> nuclear

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
designed over the fact that if nuclear

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.960 
designed over the fact that if nuclear
fusion<00:01:49.409> would<00:01:49.740> be<00:01:49.860> a<00:01:49.890> reliable<00:01:50.220> power<00:01:50.640> source

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
fusion would be a reliable power source

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.480 
fusion would be a reliable power source
for<00:01:51.210> the<00:01:51.270> future<00:01:51.540> so<00:01:52.259> the<00:01:52.680> fact<00:01:52.920> that<00:01:53.040> this<00:01:53.310> is

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
for the future so the fact that this is

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.999 
for the future so the fact that this is
basically<00:01:53.729> research<00:01:54.210> for<00:01:54.750> a<00:01:55.049> new<00:01:55.770> power

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
basically research for a new power

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.069 
basically research for a new power
source<00:01:56.219> that<00:01:56.340> will<00:01:56.670> be<00:01:56.790> infinite<00:01:57.450> and<00:01:57.479> require

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
source that will be infinite and require

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.020 
source that will be infinite and require
no<00:01:58.110> resources<00:01:58.950> other<00:01:59.159> than<00:01:59.280> electricity<00:01:59.670> is

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
no resources other than electricity is

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.850 
no resources other than electricity is
perfect<00:02:00.840> you<00:02:00.960> can<00:02:01.110> learn<00:02:01.320> a<00:02:01.380> lot<00:02:01.500> from<00:02:01.649> this

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
perfect you can learn a lot from this

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.430 
perfect you can learn a lot from this
device

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:04.440 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:08.620 

so<00:02:05.160> this<00:02:05.670> is<00:02:05.700> just<00:02:06.000> a<00:02:06.180> graph<00:02:06.390> of<00:02:06.630> how<00:02:06.930> much

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:08.630 
so this is just a graph of how much

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:12.650 
so this is just a graph of how much
theoretically<00:02:09.860> the<00:02:10.860> nuclear<00:02:11.400> fusion<00:02:11.910> reactor

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
theoretically the nuclear fusion reactor

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:14.360 
theoretically the nuclear fusion reactor
would<00:02:12.810> produce<00:02:13.020> it<00:02:13.770> would<00:02:13.890> actually<00:02:14.010> produce

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
would produce it would actually produce

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.440 
would produce it would actually produce
if<00:02:14.820> it<00:02:15.150> was<00:02:15.270> running<00:02:15.510> 24<00:02:15.990> 7<00:02:16.320> this<00:02:17.130> much<00:02:17.490> which

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
if it was running 24 7 this much which

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.800 
if it was running 24 7 this much which
is<00:02:18.630> I<00:02:18.660> think<00:02:18.840> three<00:02:19.380> billion<00:02:19.620> 1<00:02:20.520> million<00:02:20.940> want

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
is I think three billion 1 million want

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.660 
is I think three billion 1 million want
not<00:02:22.020> so<00:02:22.200> 100<00:02:22.830> million<00:02:24.770> well<00:02:25.770> it's<00:02:26.100> just<00:02:26.430> a<00:02:26.520> big

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
not so 100 million well it's just a big

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:31.100 
not so 100 million well it's just a big
number<00:02:27.000> um<00:02:28.220> yeah<00:02:29.220> so<00:02:29.520> I<00:02:29.970> know<00:02:30.510> nuclear<00:02:30.870> fusion

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
number um yeah so I know nuclear fusion

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:32.840 
number um yeah so I know nuclear fusion
has<00:02:31.320> been<00:02:31.500> a<00:02:31.530> kind<00:02:31.920> of<00:02:32.070> hard<00:02:32.280> thing<00:02:32.460> to<00:02:32.580> get<00:02:32.730> at

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
has been a kind of hard thing to get at

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:34.070 
has been a kind of hard thing to get at
what<00:02:33.000> do<00:02:33.060> you<00:02:33.120> guys<00:02:33.210> think<00:02:33.270> that<00:02:33.540> biggest

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
what do you guys think that biggest

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.780 
what do you guys think that biggest
obstacle<00:02:34.470> is<00:02:34.530> with<00:02:34.770> nuclear<00:02:35.040> fusion<00:02:35.220> heat

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
obstacle is with nuclear fusion heat

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.030 
obstacle is with nuclear fusion heat
shielding<00:02:36.150> heat<00:02:36.330> shielding<00:02:36.660> it's<00:02:36.930> 22<00:02:37.620> million

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
shielding heat shielding it's 22 million

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.070 
shielding heat shielding it's 22 million
degrees<00:02:38.250> in<00:02:38.550> that<00:02:38.670> chamber<00:02:38.880> it's<00:02:39.600> really<00:02:39.930> hot

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
degrees in that chamber it's really hot

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:41.900 
degrees in that chamber it's really hot
they<00:02:40.620> need<00:02:40.860> would<00:02:41.040> need<00:02:41.160> a<00:02:41.190> very<00:02:41.610> reflective

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
they need would need a very reflective

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:44.600 
they need would need a very reflective
and<00:02:42.360> high<00:02:42.720> resistant<00:02:43.500> material<00:02:43.920> to<00:02:44.280> keep<00:02:44.430> all

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
and high resistant material to keep all

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:47.000 
and high resistant material to keep all
that<00:02:44.730> heat<00:02:45.000> in<00:02:45.180> one<00:02:45.720> place<00:02:45.990> instead<00:02:46.710> of<00:02:46.740> an

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
that heat in one place instead of an

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.490 
that heat in one place instead of an
h-bomb<00:02:47.790> hydrogen<00:02:48.360> bomb<00:02:48.540> probably<00:02:49.350> the<00:02:49.410> most

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
h-bomb hydrogen bomb probably the most

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.380 
h-bomb hydrogen bomb probably the most
destructive<00:02:49.770> bomb<00:02:50.070> ever<00:02:50.340> involves<00:02:51.090> nuclear

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
destructive bomb ever involves nuclear

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.930 
destructive bomb ever involves nuclear
fusion<00:02:51.600> and<00:02:51.960> it<00:02:52.230> produces<00:02:52.650> a<00:02:52.890> ball<00:02:53.310> of<00:02:53.760> plasma

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
fusion and it produces a ball of plasma

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.520 
fusion and it produces a ball of plasma
and<00:02:54.360> that's<00:02:54.540> what<00:02:54.750> annihilates<00:02:55.410> everything

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
and that's what annihilates everything

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.530 
and that's what annihilates everything
but<00:02:56.400> we're<00:02:56.640> basically<00:02:56.850> trying<00:02:57.090> to<00:02:57.330> harness

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
but we're basically trying to harness

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.720 
but we're basically trying to harness
that<00:02:57.690> like<00:02:58.650> same<00:02:58.920> with<00:02:59.040> a<00:02:59.070> nuclear<00:02:59.370> bomb<00:02:59.490> and

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
that like same with a nuclear bomb and

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:00.920 
that like same with a nuclear bomb and
it<00:02:59.790> uses<00:02:59.940> nuclear<00:03:00.300> fission<00:03:00.540> which<00:03:00.750> is<00:03:00.870> the

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
it uses nuclear fission which is the

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:02.960 
it uses nuclear fission which is the
profits<00:03:01.260> of<00:03:01.380> splitting<00:03:01.770> atoms<00:03:01.950> like<00:03:02.190> it's

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
profits of splitting atoms like it's

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.210 
profits of splitting atoms like it's
kind<00:03:03.210> of<00:03:03.270> the<00:03:03.360> same<00:03:03.510> thing<00:03:03.570> and<00:03:04.220> another

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
kind of the same thing and another

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.210 
kind of the same thing and another
problem<00:03:05.730> is<00:03:06.060> the<00:03:06.420> electro<00:03:06.900> magnetics<00:03:07.380> it

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
problem is the electro magnetics it

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.940 
problem is the electro magnetics it
requires<00:03:08.820> a<00:03:09.030> lot<00:03:09.660> of<00:03:09.840> energy<00:03:10.140> to<00:03:10.650> power<00:03:10.770> those

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
requires a lot of energy to power those

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:12.350 
requires a lot of energy to power those
electromagnets<00:03:11.700> to<00:03:11.790> keep<00:03:11.910> those<00:03:12.060> atoms

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
electromagnets to keep those atoms

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:13.820 
electromagnets to keep those atoms
together<00:03:12.540> and<00:03:12.870> prevent<00:03:13.140> them<00:03:13.200> falling<00:03:13.500> apart

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.830 
together and prevent them falling apart

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:17.270 
together and prevent them falling apart
so<00:03:14.550> to<00:03:14.640> do<00:03:14.910> that<00:03:14.940> you<00:03:15.870> would<00:03:15.989> produce<00:03:16.410> less

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
so to do that you would produce less

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.370 
so to do that you would produce less
energy<00:03:17.730> than<00:03:17.760> you're<00:03:18.060> consuming<00:03:18.510> and<00:03:18.720> that's

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
energy than you're consuming and that's

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.199 
energy than you're consuming and that's
the<00:03:19.530> biggest<00:03:19.680> problem<00:03:19.890> they<00:03:20.459> have<00:03:20.670> a<00:03:20.700> reactor

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
the biggest problem they have a reactor

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:23.300 
the biggest problem they have a reactor
prototype<00:03:21.720> called<00:03:21.930> the<00:03:22.080> talk<00:03:22.260> amok<00:03:22.530> which<00:03:23.100> is

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
prototype called the talk amok which is

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:26.150 
prototype called the talk amok which is
toroidal<00:03:24.000> chamber<00:03:24.450> with<00:03:24.720> many<00:03:25.260> coils<00:03:25.500> that's

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
toroidal chamber with many coils that's

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:27.680 
toroidal chamber with many coils that's
what<00:03:26.310> it's<00:03:26.430> actually<00:03:26.550> stand<00:03:27.030> for<00:03:27.209> or<00:03:27.420> in

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
what it's actually stand for or in

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:30.410 
what it's actually stand for or in
Russian<00:03:28.020> and<00:03:28.520> it's<00:03:29.520> printed<00:03:29.880> prototypes<00:03:30.030> like

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 
Russian and it's printed prototypes like

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.570 
Russian and it's printed prototypes like
I<00:03:30.480> said<00:03:30.720> it's<00:03:30.930> working<00:03:31.380> it's<00:03:31.590> just<00:03:32.040> it's

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:32.580 
I said it's working it's just it's

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:34.280 
I said it's working it's just it's
consuming<00:03:33.060> more<00:03:33.269> energy<00:03:33.540> than<00:03:33.660> produces<00:03:34.110> so

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
consuming more energy than produces so

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:36.140 
consuming more energy than produces so
for<00:03:34.560> it<00:03:34.680> it's<00:03:34.800> not<00:03:34.920> an<00:03:35.070> action<00:03:35.340> we're<00:03:35.580> expected

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
for it it's not an action we're expected

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:37.550 
for it it's not an action we're expected
to<00:03:36.180> see<00:03:36.360> one<00:03:36.510> in<00:03:36.600> action<00:03:36.930> in<00:03:37.080> the<00:03:37.170> next<00:03:37.350> 20

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
to see one in action in the next 20

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.800 
to see one in action in the next 20
years<00:03:37.790> tell<00:03:38.790> us<00:03:38.910> a<00:03:38.970> little<00:03:39.000> more<00:03:39.360> in<00:03:39.690> detail

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
years tell us a little more in detail

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:42.250 
years tell us a little more in detail
about<00:03:40.110> how<00:03:40.260> your<00:03:40.500> external<00:03:40.830> works<00:03:41.010> here<00:03:41.190> oh

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.260 
about how your external works here oh

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.310 
about how your external works here oh
you<00:03:43.260> mean<00:03:43.380> the<00:03:43.530> reactor<00:03:43.860> it's<00:03:43.950> there<00:03:44.120> okay

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:45.320 
you mean the reactor it's there okay

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:48.350 
you mean the reactor it's there okay
like<00:03:46.320> we<00:03:46.440> said<00:03:46.560> the<00:03:47.000> electromagnetic<00:03:48.000> fields

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:48.360 
like we said the electromagnetic fields

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:52.280 
like we said the electromagnetic fields
from<00:03:48.660> those<00:03:48.870> coils<00:03:49.290> it<00:03:49.769> just<00:03:50.730> it<00:03:51.000> pulls<00:03:51.959> the

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
from those coils it just it pulls the

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:54.650 
from those coils it just it pulls the
neutrons<00:03:52.950> and<00:03:53.010> electrons<00:03:53.100> from<00:03:53.790> the<00:03:54.120> nitrogen

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660

is<00:04:06.090> accelerated<00:04:06.630> to<00:04:06.720> the<00:04:06.810> inner<00:04:06.959> grid<00:04:07.200> and

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:07.350 
is accelerated to the inner grid and

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:10.009 
is accelerated to the inner grid and
produces<00:04:07.650> a<00:04:07.890> ball<00:04:08.070> of<00:04:08.190> plasma<00:04:08.310> which<00:04:09.180> that's

00:04:10.009 --> 00:04:10.019 
produces a ball of plasma which that's

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:11.960 
produces a ball of plasma which that's
how<00:04:10.320> we<00:04:10.350> get<00:04:10.530> our<00:04:10.590> demonstration<00:04:11.220> what's<00:04:11.940> that

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:11.970 
how we get our demonstration what's that

we<00:04:20.200> got<00:04:20.230> from<00:04:20.530> garbage<00:04:20.859> this<00:04:21.489> was<00:04:21.880> from<00:04:22.000> a

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.120 
we got from garbage this was from a

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:23.190 
we got from garbage this was from a
garbage<00:04:22.360> microwave<00:04:22.720> from<00:04:22.840> my<00:04:22.930> neighbor's

garbage microwave from my neighbor's

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:25.560 
garbage microwave from my neighbor's
house<00:04:23.350> and<00:04:23.620> I<00:04:24.610> mean<00:04:25.060> it's<00:04:25.240> easily<00:04:25.510> accessible

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:25.570 
house and I mean it's easily accessible
