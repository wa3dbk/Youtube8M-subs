00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:12.389
 hello here taking internet videos point 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:13.920
 com 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.139
 You know that once I was traveling. 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.029
 plane I stopped at the airport had 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.699
 An interesting business happened there. 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.199
 wanted to record quality audio with 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.300
 she was with my camera was with 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.880
 my sound recorder with a microphone 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.080
 lapel I wanted to record is a work of 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.410
 quality when we were filming 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.149
 What happened is that the 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.620
 my coach's memory card was the 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:38.790
 The only card I had had 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:40.260
 no more cards to change and I do not 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.510
 I had to do it. I wanted to record a lot. 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.980
 and there was no recorder to record 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.690
 I did not want to record camera audio 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.510
 because everyone knows it gets too much 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.640
 Bad what I did I was in shirt and 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.350
 a shirt with a bag in the front I got 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.050
 My iphone put him upside down. 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.789
 here in my microphone shirt stayed 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.910
 pointing to my mouth I recorded the 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:02.100
 I was very excited about the iPhone and I was able to use this audio. 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.350
 then on my computer to join with 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.129
 video and get the video was causing 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.860
 very good 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:10.110
 It's after this happened that I touched myself. 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.330
 that I should have a plan b for a 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.560
 sound recorder and iphone a great plan 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.030
 b because it's a business it's an equipment 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.180
 I already have to record with 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:20.340
 quality and I ended up buying a 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.320
 iphone lapel microphone for 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.299
 use so I want to show you today 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.479
 which software I have used to 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:30.240
 record audio on iphone and the difference 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.049
 the recorder's lapel microphone and 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.270
 phone 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:35.790
 It's good, let's go, the staff. 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:39.540
 here is my iphone is this is here 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:42.000
 beech fire software is experienced 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.860
 some audio and video recording programs 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.590
 when I tried the one that was better 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.869
 also various videos and also all 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.950
 world pointing to this then I think 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.140
 that 's the best thing you can 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:55.140
 doing is the best software you can 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.180
 download this ep costs I think six 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:00.000
 $ 17 dollars in victory 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:04.950
 so it's nothing that will break your 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.880
 bank and and is a tremendous functionality 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.090
 of your device 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.399
 I am with 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:12.730
 the plug-in microphone plugged in here 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:14.349
 No phone, it's a very small one. 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:18.069
 you can see that it is much smaller than the puck 

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:20.290
 It's an honor to open the program I want. 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:23.349
 show you how it works 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:25.420
 so watch the program open you up 

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:29.560
 list of recordings you've done 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:32.200
 and here is I will stay because in the button 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.780
 microphone what he is going to choose the 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.810
 where you will see the audio then it already 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:41.920
 identified that the impetus for more than 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:44.650
 The apparatus having input is 1 r 797 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.630
 to the microphone but this blog is 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:49.329
 fooling the iphone sharqiya province 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:52.560
 the headset accepts the microphone signal 

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:55.450
 If you have not read, you have not seen the video about 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:58.629
 iphone headset over the 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:01.299
 iphone headset you can click on the air 

00:02:58.629 --> 00:03:02.590
 down or wait for the end of the video to go 

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:04.989
 have a link for that price in another 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:08.260
 video you can now choose what it is 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:11.950
 best possible quality and click on 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:14.430
 save and now I can create a 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:18.280
 new recording I want more here 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:21.250
 But now I can see what I am. 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:24.849
 recording here you are seeing the 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:27.489
 which is the sign that you write 

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:30.849
 here in the microphone and 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:32.560
 control how much you will earn 

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:34.810
 this microphone can put here 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:36.190
 at most but it's actually I'm happy and 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:38.410
 capturing that a little away from my 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:40.540
 Mouth then it is if he were in my 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:43.120
 Chest I'll put the microphone on my chest. 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:45.400
 it has an acceptable volume of one 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:49.720
 important thing here you can enter 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:52.630
 here in the configuration in the 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:54.849
 recording and here a putt and turn off the 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:57.720
 Western processing means that the 

00:03:54.849 --> 00:04:00.400
 iphone operating system will not 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:02.680
 disrupt the recording and you depending 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:06.040
 microphone and 70 may need to increase 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:08.260
 a little boost that is given more signal 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:10.060
 microphone that if you how much more 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.829
 push if you put more noise is 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:13.900
 adding then also the ideal is not 

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:15.610
 use but it is better to have a high volume one 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:20.380
 bit of noise than is the volume 

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:30.010
 super bass then it's back again 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:32.880
 here I'm sorry for a record and if I want 

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:36.099
 start recording I just need to drag 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:39.640
 If you go back and forth, it will release the 

00:04:36.099 --> 00:04:41.200
 check button and I 'm recording it's you 

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:42.849
 can see where so if I speak here 

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:44.469
 Close to the microphone you'll see 

00:04:42.849 --> 00:04:47.440
 in fact it is bursting then 

00:04:44.469 --> 00:04:51.010
 could lower the volume of the 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:54.310
 microphone and then you have a control 

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:57.940
 of recording now ending recording 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:05:00.969
 can i stay here on stop and jack wilshere 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:03.159
 and download this file directly with the 

00:05:00.969 --> 00:05:06.310
 dropbox I can open right in your 

00:05:03.159 --> 00:05:09.610
 computer or send e-mail to ftp 

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:12.760
 or itunes was the share in which you have 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:14.740
 that connect yours and your cell in the 

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:17.349
 computer and pulling itunes I think 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:19.479
 which is the worst mode of all and has s 

00:05:17.349 --> 00:05:21.539
 here too a system of 

00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:24.400
 day transfer and sound file 

00:05:21.539 --> 00:05:26.349
 but it is logical that the ideal is to transfer 

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:28.810
 dropbox one and mail which are the methods 

00:05:26.349 --> 00:05:31.390
 easier then it is so you record 

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:34.270
 with the iphone and the subway has failed so far 

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:37.360
 you do not have a deep your screen you 

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:38.620
 you can also use your own microphone 

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:42.159
 iphone to record here below 

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:44.110
 The microphone of the iphone has a 

00:05:42.159 --> 00:05:46.240
 sound and a microphone so you can use 

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:50.050
 this mic up like a lapel just you 

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:53.139
 to release the iphone recorder and 

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:54.490
 put that put the iphone in your pocket 

00:05:53.139 --> 00:05:56.830
 a shirt in the front pocket of the 

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:59.800
 shirt and so are you with a microphone 

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:01.659
 relatively close to the mouth and recording the 

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:05.229
 sound you're talking about in a way 

00:06:01.659 --> 00:06:07.210
 simple to use the iphone as a 

00:06:05.229 --> 00:06:08.229
 That lapel microphone, I hope so. 

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:10.389
 has enjoyed 

00:06:08.229 --> 00:06:12.700
 now if you do not have an iphone but yes 

00:06:10.389 --> 00:06:14.919
 an android cell phone has a side link 

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:17.289
 for you to learn how you actually 

00:06:14.919 --> 00:06:19.389
 can also record with android phone 

00:06:17.289 --> 00:06:20.110
 with lapel microphones with the 

00:06:19.389 --> 00:06:22.029
 cell phone 

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:24.009
 this you will buy a microphone of 

00:06:22.029 --> 00:06:26.139
 Lapel to use a cell phone 

00:06:24.009 --> 00:06:29.080
 It's good for you to see this video down here. 

00:06:26.139 --> 00:06:30.580
 explain what kind of 

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:32.110
 Lapel Microphone you can buy 

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:33.159
 with the type of plugs and have to buy 

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:34.539
 that's it 

00:06:33.159 --> 00:06:36.189
