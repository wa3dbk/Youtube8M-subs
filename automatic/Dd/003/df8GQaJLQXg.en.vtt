nutritionist<00:02:17.750> the<00:02:17.840> saying<00:02:18.079> this<00:02:18.170> is<00:02:18.349> not<00:02:18.500> good

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
nutritionist the saying this is not good

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.699 
nutritionist the saying this is not good
I<00:02:19.209> can<00:02:20.209> imagine<00:02:20.629> I<00:02:20.810> can<00:02:20.930> imagine<00:02:21.230> they<00:02:21.319> are<00:02:21.349> but

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:21.709 
I can imagine I can imagine they are but

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:23.949 
I can imagine I can imagine they are but
actually<00:02:22.160> just<00:02:22.910> for<00:02:23.090> this<00:02:23.180> show<00:02:23.239> I<00:02:23.629> got<00:02:23.810> my

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:23.959 
actually just for this show I got my

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:26.319 
actually just for this show I got my
blood<00:02:24.140> test<00:02:24.470> so<00:02:25.190> all<00:02:25.489> my<00:02:25.640> blood<00:02:25.849> tests<00:02:26.209> are

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:26.329 
blood test so all my blood tests are

00:02:26.329 --> 00:02:28.270 
blood test so all my blood tests are
here<00:02:26.569> and<00:02:26.840> they're<00:02:27.019> actually<00:02:27.170> perfect<00:02:27.980> and

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
here and they're actually perfect and

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:29.680 
here and they're actually perfect and
that's<00:02:28.370> after<00:02:28.610> seven<00:02:29.090> years<00:02:29.120> on<00:02:29.540> this

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 
that's after seven years on this

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:33.280 
that's after seven years on this
lifestyle<00:02:30.200> so<00:02:30.560> there's<00:02:31.280> the<00:02:31.489> theory<00:02:31.910> and<00:02:32.290> the

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
lifestyle so there's the theory and the

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.710 
lifestyle so there's the theory and the
the<00:02:33.829> practical<00:02:34.370> results<00:02:34.850> are<00:02:35.090> that<00:02:35.120> I've<00:02:35.510> lost

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
the practical results are that I've lost

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.960 
the practical results are that I've lost
over<00:02:36.049> twenty<00:02:36.470> kilos<00:02:36.920> I've<00:02:37.280> overcome<00:02:37.519> chronic

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:37.970 
over twenty kilos I've overcome chronic

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:39.550 
over twenty kilos I've overcome chronic
fatigue<00:02:38.090> syndrome<00:02:38.299> irritable<00:02:39.109> bowel

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
fatigue syndrome irritable bowel

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.280 
fatigue syndrome irritable bowel
syndrome<00:02:40.269> anorexia<00:02:41.269> bulimia<00:02:41.540> low<00:02:42.049> thyroid

syndrome anorexia bulimia low thyroid

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:44.289 
syndrome anorexia bulimia low thyroid
function<00:02:42.560> so<00:02:43.220> the<00:02:43.430> proof<00:02:43.639> really<00:02:43.970> is<00:02:44.090> in<00:02:44.209> the

00:02:44.289 --> 00:02:44.299 
function so the proof really is in the

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:45.490 
function so the proof really is in the
banana<00:02:44.480> pudding<00:02:44.780> at<00:02:45.019> the<00:02:45.109> end<00:02:45.230> of<00:02:45.319> the<00:02:45.380> day

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
banana pudding at the end of the day

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.099 
banana pudding at the end of the day
okay<00:02:45.920> you<00:02:46.370> did<00:02:46.609> obviously<00:02:47.000> had<00:02:47.870> a<00:02:47.900> lot<00:02:48.079> going

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:48.109 
okay you did obviously had a lot going

00:02:48.109 --> 00:02:50.589 
okay you did obviously had a lot going
on<00:02:48.470> there<00:02:48.650> -<00:02:48.829> now<00:02:48.980> nutritionists<00:02:49.670> say<00:02:49.700> there's

00:02:50.589 --> 00:02:50.599 
on there - now nutritionists say there's

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:53.050 
on there - now nutritionists say there's
not<00:02:50.780> enough<00:02:50.840> protein<00:02:51.620> and<00:02:51.799> too<00:02:52.459> many<00:02:52.670> carbs

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
not enough protein and too many carbs

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.089 
not enough protein and too many carbs
and<00:02:53.209> sugar<00:02:53.510> that<00:02:53.690> is<00:02:53.810> an<00:02:53.959> enormous<00:02:54.410> amount<00:02:54.799> of

00:02:55.089 --> 00:02:55.099 
and sugar that is an enormous amount of

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:57.729 
and sugar that is an enormous amount of
sugar<00:02:55.459> you<00:02:55.579> put<00:02:55.609> in<00:02:55.880> that<00:02:55.910> blend<00:02:56.239> of<00:02:56.420> it<00:02:56.569> it<00:02:57.500> is

00:02:57.729 --> 00:02:57.739 
sugar you put in that blend of it it is

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:00.400 
sugar you put in that blend of it it is
every<00:02:58.730> every<00:02:59.120> cell<00:02:59.389> in<00:02:59.540> the<00:02:59.599> human<00:02:59.630> body<00:02:59.959> runs

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410 
every every cell in the human body runs

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:03.190 
every every cell in the human body runs
on<00:03:00.680> glucose<00:03:01.250> all<00:03:01.849> the<00:03:02.120> trillions<00:03:02.630> of<00:03:02.780> cells<00:03:02.840> in

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
on glucose all the trillions of cells in

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.559 
on glucose all the trillions of cells in
our<00:03:03.290> body<00:03:03.530> so<00:03:04.130> we<00:03:04.370> are<00:03:04.489> actually<00:03:04.910> high<00:03:05.150> sugar

00:03:05.559 --> 00:03:05.569 
our body so we are actually high sugar

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:07.300 
our body so we are actually high sugar
creatures<00:03:06.079> and<00:03:06.349> that's<00:03:06.680> what<00:03:06.799> we<00:03:06.919> thrive<00:03:07.280> on

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
creatures and that's what we thrive on

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:08.949 
creatures and that's what we thrive on
you<00:03:08.030> know<00:03:08.120> that's<00:03:08.269> why<00:03:08.359> we<00:03:08.389> have<00:03:08.599> a<00:03:08.630> sweet

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:08.959 
you know that's why we have a sweet

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:11.319 
you know that's why we have a sweet
tooth<00:03:09.200> and<00:03:09.739> if<00:03:10.040> it<00:03:10.160> was<00:03:10.280> too<00:03:10.549> much<00:03:10.700> sugar<00:03:10.970> my

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:11.329 
tooth and if it was too much sugar my

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:14.259 
tooth and if it was too much sugar my
blood<00:03:11.569> test<00:03:11.930> would<00:03:12.200> reflect<00:03:13.040> that<00:03:13.459> they<00:03:14.120> would

00:03:14.259 --> 00:03:14.269 
blood test would reflect that they would

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:16.809 
blood test would reflect that they would
be<00:03:14.389> bad<00:03:14.540> and<00:03:14.959> also<00:03:15.500> I<00:03:15.530> wouldn't<00:03:15.950> you<00:03:16.430> know<00:03:16.549> look

00:03:16.809 --> 00:03:16.819 
be bad and also I wouldn't you know look

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:20.110 
be bad and also I wouldn't you know look
and<00:03:17.060> feel<00:03:17.329> as<00:03:17.660> healthy<00:03:18.139> as<00:03:18.380> I<00:03:18.530> am<00:03:18.560> and<00:03:19.340> also<00:03:19.910> the

and feel as healthy as I am and also the

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:21.430 
and feel as healthy as I am and also the
protein<00:03:20.480> one<00:03:20.780> the<00:03:21.079> World<00:03:21.230> Health

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.440 
protein one the World Health

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.409 
protein one the World Health
Organization<00:03:22.160> back<00:03:22.310> in<00:03:22.459> the<00:03:22.519> 70s<00:03:23.000> actually

00:03:23.409 --> 00:03:23.419 
Organization back in the 70s actually

00:03:23.419 --> 00:03:25.000 
Organization back in the 70s actually
discovered<00:03:23.900> through<00:03:24.049> scientific<00:03:24.560> testing

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010 
discovered through scientific testing

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:26.710 
discovered through scientific testing
that<00:03:25.190> we<00:03:25.519> only<00:03:25.639> need<00:03:25.849> two<00:03:26.000> point<00:03:26.299> five<00:03:26.510> percent

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 
that we only need two point five percent

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.720 
that we only need two point five percent
of<00:03:26.930> calories<00:03:27.139> from<00:03:27.440> protein<00:03:27.530> and<00:03:28.190> this

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730 
of calories from protein and this

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:30.699 
of calories from protein and this
lifestyle<00:03:29.239> gives<00:03:29.480> at<00:03:29.660> least<00:03:29.690> five<00:03:30.169> percent<00:03:30.410> of

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:30.709 
lifestyle gives at least five percent of

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:32.710 
lifestyle gives at least five percent of
calories<00:03:31.099> so<00:03:31.370> I've<00:03:32.030> got<00:03:32.180> that<00:03:32.329> covered

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:32.720 
calories so I've got that covered

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:34.960 
calories so I've got that covered
