will<00:01:34.770> all<00:01:34.979> take<00:01:35.340> because<00:01:36.180> i<00:01:36.540> know<00:01:36.840> what

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
will all take because i know what

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.679 
will all take because i know what
happens<00:01:37.860> at<00:01:37.979> the<00:01:38.100> end<00:01:38.130> of<00:01:38.400> the<00:01:38.579> camara<00:01:39.150> and<00:01:39.420> so

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
happens at the end of the camara and so

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.920 
happens at the end of the camara and so
I<00:01:39.720> know<00:01:39.840> it<00:01:40.140> can't<00:01:40.380> take<00:01:40.590> place<00:01:40.860> sir<00:01:41.750> so<00:01:42.750> I'm

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
I know it can't take place sir so I'm

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.780 
I know it can't take place sir so I'm

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.800 
forward to this one especially supposed
to<00:02:03.550> premiere<00:02:04.180> on<00:02:05.130> 727<00:02:06.130> so<00:02:06.520> I<00:02:06.790> mean<00:02:07.300> we<00:02:07.510> didn't

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 
to premiere on 727 so I mean we didn't

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:09.990 
to premiere on 727 so I mean we didn't
get<00:02:07.990> the<00:02:08.140> last<00:02:08.320> Hannah<00:02:09.009> Hannah<00:02:09.220> movie<00:02:09.580> lowly<00:02:09.850> a

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
get the last Hannah Hannah movie lowly a

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.610 
get the last Hannah Hannah movie lowly a
couple<00:02:10.330> weeks<00:02:10.479> ago<00:02:10.570> and<00:02:10.810> I<00:02:10.869> think<00:02:11.140> that<00:02:11.350> came

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
couple weeks ago and I think that came

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.730 
couple weeks ago and I think that came
out<00:02:12.630> quite<00:02:13.630> a<00:02:13.780> while<00:02:14.050> ago<00:02:14.350> I<00:02:14.380> think<00:02:14.650> it

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:14.740 
out quite a while ago I think it

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:19.230 
out quite a while ago I think it
premiered<00:02:15.220> in<00:02:15.340> January<00:02:16.090> lat<00:02:17.310> this<00:02:18.310> year<00:02:18.670> so<00:02:19.060> it

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:19.240 
premiered in January lat this year so it

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:20.970 
premiered in January lat this year so it
took<00:02:19.600> us<00:02:19.810> like<00:02:19.930> nearly<00:02:20.290> half<00:02:20.560> a<00:02:20.709> month

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
took us like nearly half a month

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.910 
took us like nearly half a month
fluorite<00:02:21.820> the<00:02:21.970> gum<00:02:22.150> out<00:02:22.300> and<00:02:22.630> I'm<00:02:23.350> just<00:02:23.740> there

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
wondering as well like who was that like

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:29.460 
wondering as well like who was that like
at<00:02:27.610> the<00:02:27.760> top<00:02:28.030> of<00:02:28.060> the<00:02:28.390> poster<00:02:28.840> because<00:02:29.080> you<00:02:29.230> see

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
at the top of the poster because you see

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:32.010 
at the top of the poster because you see
this<00:02:29.680> guy<00:02:29.920> kind<00:02:30.459> of<00:02:30.520> Inca<00:02:30.880> lat<00:02:31.030> light<00:02:31.300> control

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:32.020 
this guy kind of Inca lat light control

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:33.750 
this guy kind of Inca lat light control
the<00:02:32.140> dark<00:02:32.590> energy<00:02:33.130> or<00:02:33.250> something<00:02:33.459> I've<00:02:33.550> made

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
the dark energy or something I've made

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.330 
the dark energy or something I've made
some<00:02:34.060> Nell<00:02:34.300> ability<00:02:34.810> and<00:02:35.140> I<00:02:35.800> was<00:02:35.920> like<00:02:36.040> maybe

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
some Nell ability and I was like maybe

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.430 
some Nell ability and I was like maybe
that<00:02:36.610> might<00:02:36.850> be<00:02:37.060> the<00:02:37.090> body<00:02:37.420> but<00:02:37.870> I<00:02:38.080> think<00:02:38.350> they

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
that might be the body but I think they

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.199 
that might be the body but I think they
just<00:02:38.470> missed<00:02:38.920> out<00:02:39.100> on<00:02:39.130> his<00:02:39.430> face<00:02:39.640> so<00:02:39.940> maybe

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:40.209 
just missed out on his face so maybe

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:41.900 
just missed out on his face so maybe
there<00:02:40.390> might<00:02:40.420> be<00:02:40.600> in<00:02:40.750> the<00:02:40.870> body<00:02:41.080> for<00:02:41.410> them<00:02:41.500> oh

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
there might be in the body for them oh

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:44.040 
there might be in the body for them oh
but<00:02:42.910> what<00:02:43.090> do<00:02:43.180> you<00:02:43.239> guys<00:02:43.390> think<00:02:43.450> well<00:02:43.780> this<00:02:43.900> me

very good one and this one I think this

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:53.850 
very good one and this one I think this

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:53.860 
one might just be bear from what the

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:56.340 
one might just be bear from what the
story<00:02:54.280> sounds<00:02:54.850> and<00:02:55.030> just<00:02:55.540> how<00:02:55.840> it's<00:02:56.080> going<00:02:56.290> to

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:56.350 
story sounds and just how it's going to

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:59.220 
story sounds and just how it's going to
be<00:02:56.440> involved<00:02:56.680> in<00:02:56.860> 100<00:02:57.510> that's<00:02:58.510> my<00:02:58.660> opinion<00:02:58.870> but

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
be involved in 100 that's my opinion but

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.140 
be involved in 100 that's my opinion but
we<00:02:59.470> never<00:02:59.620> know<00:02:59.860> what<00:03:00.070> this<00:03:00.220> movie<00:03:00.400> can<00:03:00.730> be<00:03:00.760> or
