00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:17.849 
that's a waste of time for your channel

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:19.399 
that's a waste of time for your channel
and<00:02:17.970> for<00:02:18.480> your<00:02:18.569> audience<00:02:18.750> like<00:02:19.079> no<00:02:19.230> one<00:02:19.349> wants

00:02:25.369 --> 00:02:25.379 
something unless that's all you do is

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:27.920 
something unless that's all you do is
you<00:02:26.040> know<00:02:26.159> reviews<00:02:26.640> on<00:02:26.939> certain<00:02:27.360> things<00:02:27.390> and

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
you know reviews on certain things and

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:29.270 
you know reviews on certain things and
like<00:02:28.079> they're<00:02:28.230> looking<00:02:28.349> for<00:02:28.530> positives<00:02:29.159> and

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
like they're looking for positives and

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:30.410 
like they're looking for positives and
negatives<00:02:29.340> but<00:02:29.790> if<00:02:29.909> you're<00:02:30.000> trying<00:02:30.150> to<00:02:30.269> do

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
negatives but if you're trying to do

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.080 
negatives but if you're trying to do
more<00:02:30.599> like<00:02:30.840> an<00:02:31.079> organic<00:02:31.680> kind<00:02:32.159> of<00:02:32.370> sponsorship

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
more like an organic kind of sponsorship

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:34.160 
more like an organic kind of sponsorship
like<00:02:33.299> just<00:02:33.480> do<00:02:33.599> something<00:02:33.810> that<00:02:33.959> you<00:02:34.079> really

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
like just do something that you really

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.410 
like just do something that you really
care<00:02:34.590> about<00:02:34.620> and<00:02:35.220> then<00:02:35.670> I<00:02:35.700> guess<00:02:35.849> a<00:02:35.879> channel<00:02:36.329> is

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
care about and then I guess a channel is

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.599 
care about and then I guess a channel is
always<00:02:36.780> negative<00:02:37.019> all<00:02:37.470> the<00:02:37.500> time<00:02:37.680> and<00:02:38.340> then<00:02:38.459> it

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:38.609 
always negative all the time and then it

00:02:38.609 --> 00:02:42.289 
always negative all the time and then it
might<00:02:38.730> fit<00:02:40.040> yeah<00:02:41.040> absolutely<00:02:41.340> otherwise<00:02:42.120> it's

00:02:42.289 --> 00:02:42.299 
might fit yeah absolutely otherwise it's

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:43.819 
might fit yeah absolutely otherwise it's
singing<00:02:42.540> I<00:02:42.720> just<00:02:42.870> passed<00:02:43.049> tell<00:02:43.409> the<00:02:43.500> Brandon

singing I just passed tell the Brandon

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:46.069 
singing I just passed tell the Brandon
in<00:02:44.040> most<00:02:44.280> brands<00:02:44.579> actually<00:02:45.299> all<00:02:45.480> brand<00:02:45.780> are
