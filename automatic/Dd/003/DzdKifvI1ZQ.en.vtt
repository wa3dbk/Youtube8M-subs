healing long fighting would would be the

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:41.090 
healing long fighting would would be the
best<00:02:35.950> option<00:02:36.660> but<00:02:37.660> we'll<00:02:38.380> see

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:44.810

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820 
but so far so good I'm not taking a ton

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:47.150 
but so far so good I'm not taking a ton
of<00:02:44.850> damage<00:02:45.090> I<00:02:45.360> seem<00:02:45.600> to<00:02:45.870> have<00:02:46.590> a<00:02:46.650> pretty<00:02:46.890> easy

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
of damage I seem to have a pretty easy

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:04.800 
from them which ends up coming out it's

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:09.890 
from them which ends up coming out it's
like<00:03:04.950> 110<00:03:05.490> thousand<00:03:06.230> which<00:03:07.230> is<00:03:07.650> a<00:03:08.040> lot<00:03:08.780> so<00:03:09.780> it

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
like 110 thousand which is a lot so it

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:14.600 
like 110 thousand which is a lot so it
helps<00:03:10.140> that<00:03:10.230> a<00:03:10.290> lot<00:03:12.710> still<00:03:13.710> using<00:03:14.040> corruption

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610 
helps that a lot still using corruption

original metamorphosis which would burn

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:29.510 
original metamorphosis which would burn
through<00:03:27.960> my<00:03:28.110> demonic<00:03:28.350> here<00:03:28.680> really<00:03:29.010> fast<00:03:29.190> but

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:29.520 
through my demonic here really fast but

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:31.400 
through my demonic here really fast but
in<00:03:29.670> this<00:03:29.820> form<00:03:30.060> I'm<00:03:30.210> actually<00:03:30.420> getting<00:03:30.900> up<00:03:31.200> to

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
in this form I'm actually getting up to

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:33.770 
in this form I'm actually getting up to
a<00:03:31.440> thousand<00:03:32.040> and<00:03:32.300> staying<00:03:33.300> at<00:03:33.510> it<00:03:33.630> pretty

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
a thousand and staying at it pretty

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:38.240 
a thousand and staying at it pretty
constantly<00:03:34.500> so<00:03:36.950> think<00:03:37.950> I'm<00:03:38.010> doing<00:03:38.130> pretty

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
constantly so think I'm doing pretty

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:39.980 
constantly so think I'm doing pretty
well<00:03:38.460> considering<00:03:38.940> how<00:03:39.150> horrible<00:03:39.600> my<00:03:39.660> world

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:39.990 
well considering how horrible my world

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:43.810 
well considering how horrible my world
on<00:03:40.170> a<00:03:40.200> warlock<00:03:40.740> has<00:03:40.980> like<00:03:41.310> a<00:03:41.810> 345<00:03:42.810> item<00:03:43.230> level

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:43.820 
on a warlock has like a 345 item level

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:50.720 
on a warlock has like a 345 item level
so<00:03:45.230> actually<00:03:47.840> someone<00:03:48.840> who<00:03:48.990> at<00:03:49.980> a<00:03:50.040> higher<00:03:50.370> item

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730 
so actually someone who at a higher item

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:53.330 
so actually someone who at a higher item
level<00:03:50.970> would<00:03:51.540> do<00:03:51.750> a<00:03:52.170> whole<00:03:52.770> lot<00:03:52.800> better<00:03:53.010> than

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
level would do a whole lot better than

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:57.440 
level would do a whole lot better than
I'm<00:03:53.520> doing<00:03:53.550> I'm<00:03:54.030> sure<00:03:54.650> but<00:03:55.650> uh<00:03:55.700> into<00:03:56.700> a<00:03:56.760> 4<00:03:57.150> pull

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450 
I'm doing I'm sure but uh into a 4 pull

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:01.070 
I'm doing I'm sure but uh into a 4 pull
here<00:03:58.700> to<00:03:59.700> a<00:03:59.730> poem<00:04:00.000> back<00:04:00.270> so<00:04:00.480> I<00:04:00.540> don't<00:04:00.570> pull<00:04:00.990> the

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:01.080 
here to a poem back so I don't pull the

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:07.750 
here to a poem back so I don't pull the
boss<00:04:03.830> drive<00:04:04.830> some<00:04:05.070> hands<00:04:05.340> a<00:04:05.490> full<00:04:05.730> day

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:07.760 
boss drive some hands a full day

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:13.800 
boss drive some hands a full day
we<00:04:08.760> use<00:04:09.030> some<00:04:09.269> of<00:04:09.420> my<00:04:09.860> spells<00:04:10.860> here

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:13.810 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:16.349 

it's<00:04:14.500> it<00:04:14.890> really<00:04:15.489> seems<00:04:15.730> like<00:04:15.940> you<00:04:16.209> do<00:04:16.329> a

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:16.359 
it's it really seems like you do a

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:18.539 
it's it really seems like you do a
pretty<00:04:16.630> decent<00:04:16.900> amount<00:04:17.290> of<00:04:17.350> damage<00:04:17.709> to<00:04:17.739> land<00:04:18.220> I

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:18.549 
pretty decent amount of damage to land I

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:21.240 
pretty decent amount of damage to land I
think<00:04:19.120> for<00:04:19.389> my<00:04:19.510> gear<00:04:19.840> he's<00:04:20.590> doing<00:04:20.889> quite<00:04:21.040> a<00:04:21.160> bit

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:21.250 
think for my gear he's doing quite a bit

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:24.270 
think for my gear he's doing quite a bit
of<00:04:21.370> damage<00:04:21.489> and<00:04:22.150> it<00:04:23.050> doesn't<00:04:23.380> seem<00:04:23.530> too<00:04:23.770> bad<00:04:23.800> on

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:24.280 
of damage and it doesn't seem too bad on

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:27.260 
of damage and it doesn't seem too bad on
keeping<00:04:25.090> your<00:04:25.120> health<00:04:25.419> of<00:04:25.720> just<00:04:26.590> by<00:04:26.770> herself

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
keeping your health of just by herself

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:30.720 
keeping your health of just by herself
so<00:04:28.270> I<00:04:28.330> would<00:04:28.510> think<00:04:28.690> with<00:04:29.680> a<00:04:29.740> healer<00:04:30.130> I<00:04:30.490> don't

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:30.730 
so I would think with a healer I don't

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:33.120 
so I would think with a healer I don't
see<00:04:30.940> any<00:04:31.090> reason<00:04:31.240> why<00:04:31.419> warlock<00:04:32.050> couldn't<00:04:32.500> tank

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:33.130 
see any reason why warlock couldn't tank

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:36.060 
see any reason why warlock couldn't tank
five-man<00:04:33.700> dungeons<00:04:34.180> fairly<00:04:34.570> easily<00:04:35.070> like

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:36.070 
five-man dungeons fairly easily like

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:41.580 
five-man dungeons fairly easily like

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:41.590 
this um drinks went here so I'm ready

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:45.720 
this um drinks went here so I'm ready
for<00:04:41.740> the<00:04:41.950> ball<00:04:43.889> it<00:04:44.889> would<00:04:45.010> be<00:04:45.130> nice<00:04:45.280> if<00:04:45.340> they

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:45.730 
for the ball it would be nice if they

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:47.690 
for the ball it would be nice if they
did<00:04:45.940> something<00:04:46.210> with<00:04:46.510> dream<00:04:46.750> life<00:04:47.020> to<00:04:47.350> where

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:47.700 
did something with dream life to where

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:50.370 
did something with dream life to where
maybe<00:04:48.700> it<00:04:48.880> healed<00:04:49.150> a<00:04:49.270> little<00:04:49.510> more<00:04:49.750> when<00:04:50.260> you

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:50.380 
maybe it healed a little more when you

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:53.280 
maybe it healed a little more when you
were<00:04:50.500> in<00:04:50.620> threatening<00:04:51.040> presence<00:04:51.370> or<00:04:52.290> maybe

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:53.290 
were in threatening presence or maybe

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:56.790 
were in threatening presence or maybe
just<00:04:53.430> was<00:04:54.430> an<00:04:54.550> instant<00:04:55.030> cast<00:04:55.630> yield<00:04:56.440> for<00:04:56.770> a

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:56.800 
just was an instant cast yield for a
