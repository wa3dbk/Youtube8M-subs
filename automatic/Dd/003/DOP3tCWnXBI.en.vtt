00:00:01.449 --> 00:00:03.170
 Exercise 20 

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:09.139
 quatela following pensions equivalent to imagine how much - 4 resign 

00:00:10.449 --> 00:00:14.829
 good after that solid data of the book then any subject of the body 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.460
 we never have 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:19.539
 imminent 

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:23.449
 more have 4 - 4 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:25.669
 in nyc and 

00:00:25.669 --> 00:00:28.520
 first develop the square of a trillion 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:32.010
 it is a wine a cocktail agreement 

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:33.470
 of a wine 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:37.640
 is the square in the first term is estimated square 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.110
 plus 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:44.140
 double the first term by the second twice the first term 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.600
 12 min was the second 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.710
 more always more the square of the second term sticks to the square 

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:55.340
 4 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:56.970
 kennedy 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:59.570
 perry bruno rossi similar terms 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:02.580
 we leave then it has square 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:04.140
 aspirants 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.590
 let's see what 5 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:09.040
 +2 Yemeni - 4 mm 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:15.440
 Mass effect raised minus 4-2 to seven same days 2 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.010
 in my time 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:21.090
 more on my block 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.810
 good and we want to acquire what they tell who weighs him although tourism 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.710
 is the same as a binomial square 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:33.510
 I want to correspond to which he named for a hundred thousand 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:36.280
 less have 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.720
 40 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.330
 let's go account 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:42.400
 of that because if we develop 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.580
 this expression we are going criminal 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:46.920
 they are preventing with checking 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.870
 square first term square 

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:54.790
 the menu - double the first by the second will be all 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:57.290
 niimi 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:00.230
 and simpler plus the second term that is 

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:01.500
 in the frame 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.320
 they have the same thing that 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.300
 we had previously 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:08.300
 therefore the corresponding third day 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:09.709
 the alternative
