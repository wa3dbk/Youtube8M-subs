the central issue that's driving this

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:14.690 
the central issue that's driving this
the<00:03:12.210> one<00:03:12.450> thing<00:03:12.750> that<00:03:12.780> inoculates<00:03:13.740> us<00:03:14.040> from

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
the one thing that inoculates us from

the one thing that inoculates us from
what's<00:03:14.940> happening<00:03:15.480> in<00:03:15.600> Europe<00:03:15.810> is<00:03:16.380> for<00:03:16.770> us<00:03:16.890> to

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
what's happening in Europe is for us to

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.190 
what's happening in Europe is for us to
deal<00:03:17.370> with<00:03:17.610> our<00:03:17.760> own<00:03:17.880> issues<00:03:18.150> but<00:03:18.840> we<00:03:18.989> have<00:03:19.170> a

deal with our own issues but we have a

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.620 
deal with our own issues but we have a
president<00:03:19.560> who<00:03:20.040> doesn't<00:03:20.730> have<00:03:20.910> the<00:03:21.120> courage

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630

or ability to lead on that one issue and

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:27.800 
or ability to lead on that one issue and
what<00:03:25.770> infuriates<00:03:26.430> me<00:03:26.580> as<00:03:26.880> Tennyson's<00:03:27.570> are

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
what infuriates me as Tennyson's are

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:30.170 
what infuriates me as Tennyson's are
being<00:03:28.080> harmed<00:03:28.410> by<00:03:29.100> his<00:03:29.400> lack<00:03:29.700> of<00:03:29.730> leadership

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
being harmed by his lack of leadership

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.300 
being harmed by his lack of leadership
there<00:03:30.750> are<00:03:30.870> plenty<00:03:31.080> of<00:03:31.230> people<00:03:31.650> in<00:03:31.770> Congress

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
there are plenty of people in Congress

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:35.060 
there are plenty of people in Congress
that<00:03:32.910> are<00:03:33.060> ready<00:03:33.300> for<00:03:33.690> a<00:03:33.720> real<00:03:34.200> solution<00:03:34.920> I

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:35.070 
that are ready for a real solution I

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:37.430 
that are ready for a real solution I
think<00:03:35.340> he<00:03:35.459> could<00:03:35.610> get<00:03:35.790> Steny<00:03:36.180> Hoyer<00:03:36.480> I<00:03:36.840> think

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
think he could get Steny Hoyer I think

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.500 
think he could get Steny Hoyer I think
you<00:03:37.530> get<00:03:37.739> leadership<00:03:38.430> of<00:03:38.610> Congress<00:03:39.090> to<00:03:39.120> sit

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
you get leadership of Congress to sit

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.330 
you get leadership of Congress to sit
down<00:03:39.690> and<00:03:39.900> deal<00:03:40.110> with<00:03:40.320> this<00:03:40.470> issue<00:03:40.709> and<00:03:41.130> if

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
down and deal with this issue and if

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.850

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:45.660 
could do it quickly and remember the

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:49.280 
could do it quickly and remember the
