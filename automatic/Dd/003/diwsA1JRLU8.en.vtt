this<00:01:35.280> is<00:01:35.460> pretty<00:01:36.360> big<00:01:37.729> but<00:01:38.729> just<00:01:38.759> enough<00:01:39.180> to

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
this is pretty big but just enough to

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.539 
this is pretty big but just enough to
spread<00:01:39.659> it<00:01:39.780> around<00:01:39.930> spread<00:01:40.860> on<00:01:40.979> your<00:01:41.009> face<00:01:41.280> and

spread it around spread on your face and

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.490 
spread it around spread on your face and
put<00:01:41.700> it<00:01:41.759> in<00:01:41.850> the<00:01:41.909> microwave<00:01:42.030> for<00:01:42.390> eight<00:01:43.229> to<00:01:43.290> ten

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
put it in the microwave for eight to ten

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.440 
put it in the microwave for eight to ten
seconds<00:01:44.250> depending<00:01:44.700> on<00:01:44.790> how<00:01:44.970> big<00:01:45.210> and

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
seconds depending on how big and

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.149 
seconds depending on how big and
powerful<00:01:45.540> your<00:01:45.930> microwave<00:01:46.259> is<00:01:46.530> mine's<00:01:46.920> pretty

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
powerful your microwave is mine's pretty

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:52.490 
powerful your microwave is mine's pretty
weak<00:01:47.430> so<00:01:47.820> ten<00:01:48.600> seconds<00:01:50.930> you<00:01:51.930> just<00:01:51.960> want<00:01:52.350> it<00:01:52.439> to

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
weak so ten seconds you just want it to

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:58.100 
weak so ten seconds you just want it to
be<00:01:53.509> thinner<00:01:54.530> because<00:01:56.450> it's<00:01:57.450> it's<00:01:57.810> a<00:01:57.869> little

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
be thinner because it's it's a little

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.749 
be thinner because it's it's a little
harder<00:01:58.409> to<00:01:58.439> spread<00:01:58.890> and<00:01:59.159> it's<00:01:59.280> much<00:01:59.520> more

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
harder to spread and it's much more

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.630 
harder to spread and it's much more
sticky<00:02:00.360> before<00:02:00.990> you<00:02:01.110> eat<00:02:01.290> it<00:02:01.439> up<00:02:01.560> and<00:02:01.829> then<00:02:02.549> I

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
sticky before you eat it up and then I

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.160 
sticky before you eat it up and then I
just<00:02:02.670> take<00:02:03.030> a<00:02:03.060> cheap<00:02:03.360> foundation<00:02:03.930> brush<00:02:04.140> and

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
just take a cheap foundation brush and

rinse it off and do it again the next
day<00:02:47.629> the<00:02:48.629> reason<00:02:49.040> that<00:02:50.040> honey<00:02:50.810> works<00:02:51.810> is

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
day the reason that honey works is

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.129 
day the reason that honey works is
because<00:02:52.980> it's<00:02:53.159> a<00:02:53.280> natural<00:02:53.489> antibacterial<00:02:54.209> and

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:55.139 
because it's a natural antibacterial and

00:02:55.139 --> 00:02:59.149 
because it's a natural antibacterial and
antiseptic<00:02:56.180> so<00:02:57.530> the<00:02:58.530> reason<00:02:58.859> you<00:02:58.889> have<00:02:59.129> a

00:02:59.149 --> 00:02:59.159 
antiseptic so the reason you have a

00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:01.970 
antiseptic so the reason you have a
pimple<00:02:59.459> is<00:02:59.819> because<00:03:00.239> there's<00:03:00.959> bacteria<00:03:01.230> in

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
pimple is because there's bacteria in

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.539 
pimple is because there's bacteria in
your<00:03:02.190> skin<00:03:02.510> clogging<00:03:03.510> your<00:03:03.540> pores<00:03:03.629> so<00:03:04.549> the

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:05.549 
your skin clogging your pores so the

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:08.629 
your skin clogging your pores so the
honey<00:03:05.790> will<00:03:06.299> work<00:03:06.540> to<00:03:06.959> get<00:03:07.859> rid<00:03:08.040> of<00:03:08.129> that<00:03:08.280> to

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:08.639 
honey will work to get rid of that to

00:03:08.639 --> 00:03:10.910 
honey will work to get rid of that to
kill<00:03:08.849> that<00:03:09.060> bacteria<00:03:09.239> and<00:03:09.780> it'll<00:03:10.260> be<00:03:10.379> a<00:03:10.409> lot

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
kill that bacteria and it'll be a lot

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:14.479 
kill that bacteria and it'll be a lot

because I had a lot of scarring to it it

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:41.899 
because I had a lot of scarring to it it
does<00:04:39.569> reduce<00:04:39.810> and<00:04:40.229> scarring<00:04:40.530> there<00:04:41.520> are<00:04:41.669> a<00:04:41.729> lot

00:04:41.899 --> 00:04:41.909 
does reduce and scarring there are a lot

00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:44.390 
does reduce and scarring there are a lot
of<00:04:42.090> like<00:04:42.300> wound<00:04:42.659> gels<00:04:43.020> that<00:04:43.409> contain<00:04:44.099> honey

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:44.400 
of like wound gels that contain honey

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.339 
of like wound gels that contain honey
and<00:04:44.759> that<00:04:45.000> is<00:04:45.240> because<00:04:46.080> it's<00:04:46.229> an

00:04:46.339 --> 00:04:46.349 
and that is because it's an

00:04:46.349 --> 00:04:48.050 
and that is because it's an
antibacterial<00:04:46.590> and<00:04:47.189> all<00:04:47.250> of<00:04:47.370> that<00:04:47.520> but<00:04:47.939> also

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:48.060 
antibacterial and all of that but also

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:53.869 
antibacterial and all of that but also
because<00:04:48.509> it<00:04:48.689> reduces<00:04:49.229> the<00:04:49.289> scarring<00:04:52.460> and<00:04:53.460> you

because it reduces the scarring and you

00:04:53.879 --> 00:04:55.659 
because it reduces the scarring and you
know<00:04:54.030> it<00:04:54.120> works<00:04:54.330> because<00:04:54.569> they've<00:04:54.930> been<00:04:55.080> using

00:04:55.659 --> 00:04:55.669 
know it works because they've been using

00:04:55.669 --> 00:05:00.170 
know it works because they've been using
honey<00:04:56.669> and<00:04:57.060> like<00:04:57.449> medicine<00:04:58.319> for<00:04:59.030> thousands<00:05:00.030> of

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:00.180 
honey and like medicine for thousands of

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:08.749 
honey and like medicine for thousands of
years<00:05:00.509> before<00:05:01.159> the<00:05:02.159> modern<00:05:02.430> man<00:05:07.190> yeah<00:05:08.190> so<00:05:08.550> it

00:05:08.749 --> 00:05:08.759 
years before the modern man yeah so it

00:05:08.759 --> 00:05:11.930 
years before the modern man yeah so it
works<00:05:09.110> and<00:05:10.110> I<00:05:10.229> love<00:05:10.440> it<00:05:10.650> then<00:05:11.250> it's<00:05:11.400> cheap<00:05:11.729> I

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:11.940 
works and I love it then it's cheap I

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:13.659 
works and I love it then it's cheap I
think<00:05:11.969> this<00:05:12.300> was<00:05:12.509> like<00:05:12.719> five<00:05:12.990> or<00:05:13.020> six<00:05:13.379> dollars

00:05:13.659 --> 00:05:13.669 
think this was like five or six dollars

00:05:13.669 --> 00:05:15.999 
think this was like five or six dollars
you<00:05:14.669> can<00:05:14.849> find<00:05:15.060> it<00:05:15.210> cheaper

00:05:15.999 --> 00:05:16.009 
you can find it cheaper

00:05:16.009 --> 00:05:19.760 
you can find it cheaper
it's<00:05:17.009> a<00:05:17.190> dependent<00:05:17.639> price<00:05:17.789> on<00:05:18.029> it<00:05:18.440> so<00:05:19.440> I<00:05:19.469> didn't

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:19.770 
it's a dependent price on it so I didn't

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:21.110 
it's a dependent price on it so I didn't
know<00:05:19.830> until<00:05:19.979> I<00:05:20.099> got<00:05:20.279> home<00:05:20.460> that<00:05:20.669> it<00:05:20.759> cost<00:05:20.940> six

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:21.120 
know until I got home that it cost six

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:23.629 
know until I got home that it cost six
dollars<00:05:21.590> you<00:05:22.590> can<00:05:22.740> also<00:05:22.860> buy<00:05:23.129> more<00:05:23.520> expensive

00:05:23.629 --> 00:05:23.639 
dollars you can also buy more expensive

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:27.439 
dollars you can also buy more expensive
