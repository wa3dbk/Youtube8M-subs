00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
happen so yeah I mean he did it last

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.140 
happen so yeah I mean he did it last
year<00:01:40.829> though<00:01:41.070> he<00:01:41.340> failed<00:01:41.549> to<00:01:41.729> make<00:01:41.909> a<00:01:41.939> main

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
year though he failed to make a main

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.819 
year though he failed to make a main
event<00:01:42.479> so<00:01:42.720> hopefully<00:01:43.020> he<00:01:43.170> got<00:01:43.530> that<00:01:43.680> out<00:01:43.740> of

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
event so hopefully he got that out of

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.370 
event so hopefully he got that out of
the<00:01:43.920> system<00:01:44.159> yeah<00:01:44.850> III<00:01:45.780> think<00:01:45.960> it's<00:01:46.170> I<00:01:46.320> think

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
the system yeah III think it's I think

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:47.870 
the system yeah III think it's I think
it's<00:01:46.530> more<00:01:46.649> just<00:01:46.829> interesting<00:01:47.490> to<00:01:47.549> watch<00:01:47.640> the
