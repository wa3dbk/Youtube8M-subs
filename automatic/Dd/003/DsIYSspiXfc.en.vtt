00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.100 

ok<00:01:29.490> so<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:29.670> t54<00:01:30.240> such<00:01:30.420> pressure<00:01:30.659> on<00:01:30.780> me<00:01:30.900> so<00:01:31.049> I

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
ok so the t54 such pressure on me so I

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.749 
ok so the t54 such pressure on me so I
think<00:01:31.259> he's<00:01:31.590> definitely<00:01:32.009> spotted<00:01:32.220> which<00:01:32.579> I

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
think he's definitely spotted which I

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.670

dead<00:01:33.030> I'm<00:01:33.240> not<00:01:33.479> looking<00:01:34.140> back<00:01:34.290> on<00:01:34.320> it<00:01:34.470> now<00:01:34.530> I

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
dead I'm not looking back on it now I

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.789 
dead I'm not looking back on it now I
don't<00:01:34.890> think<00:01:35.100> he<00:01:35.310> actually<00:01:35.430> supporting<00:01:35.880> me

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:36.799 
don't think he actually supporting me

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:39.859 
don't think he actually supporting me
okay<00:01:37.799> so<00:01:38.400> he<00:01:38.460> starts<00:01:38.880> getting<00:01:39.000> hit<00:01:39.240> by<00:01:39.270> I<00:01:39.420> weeds

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
okay so he starts getting hit by I weeds

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.359 
okay so he starts getting hit by I weeds
and<00:01:40.140> trucks<00:01:40.680> should<00:01:40.799> I<00:01:40.920> hate<00:01:41.070> yourself
