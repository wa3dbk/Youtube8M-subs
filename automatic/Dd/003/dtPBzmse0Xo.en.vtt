00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
I think when he first came people wonder

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.399 
I think when he first came people wonder
if<00:01:17.909> he<00:01:17.970> was<00:01:18.030> just<00:01:18.150> a<00:01:18.270> one-trick<00:01:18.570> pony<00:01:18.869> or<00:01:19.020> pony

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
if he was just a one-trick pony or pony

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.350

but<00:01:19.530> lots<00:01:19.740> of<00:01:19.860> tricks<00:01:20.159> I<00:01:20.400> think<00:01:21.000> now<00:01:21.180> they

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
but lots of tricks I think now they

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.700
