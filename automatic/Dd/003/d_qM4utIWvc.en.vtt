00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:02.560 
make it just a tiny bit more complicated
but<00:04:00.560> still<00:04:00.770> pretty<00:04:00.860> easy<00:04:01.160> you<00:04:02.150> can<00:04:02.300> do<00:04:02.360> it<00:04:02.450> like

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:02.570 
but still pretty easy you can do it like

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:05.770 
but still pretty easy you can do it like
this<00:04:02.720> e-minor<00:04:03.880> 2d<00:04:04.880> play<00:04:05.210> a<00:04:05.240> D<00:04:05.420> chord<00:04:05.690> right

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:05.780 
this e-minor 2d play a D chord right

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:08.680 
this e-minor 2d play a D chord right
here<00:04:06.080> and<00:04:06.430> then<00:04:07.430> you<00:04:07.880> just<00:04:08.060> with<00:04:08.240> your<00:04:08.360> thumb

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:08.690 
here and then you just with your thumb

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:10.720 
here and then you just with your thumb
you<00:04:08.930> press<00:04:09.200> down<00:04:09.230> the<00:04:09.620> second<00:04:10.010> fret<00:04:10.250> at<00:04:10.490> the

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:10.730 
you press down the second fret at the

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:14.410 
you press down the second fret at the
low<00:04:11.360> E<00:04:11.630> string<00:04:12.190> right<00:04:13.190> there<00:04:13.400> ok<00:04:13.880> and<00:04:14.060> now<00:04:14.240> this

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:14.420 
low E string right there ok and now this

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:16.900 
low E string right there ok and now this
is<00:04:14.600> a<00:04:14.630> d<00:04:14.960> /<00:04:15.380> f<00:04:15.530> sharp<00:04:15.950> chord<00:04:16.340> and<00:04:16.519> that's<00:04:16.670> more

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:16.910 
is a d / f sharp chord and that's more

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:18.699 
is a d / f sharp chord and that's more
what<00:04:17.060> it<00:04:17.180> does<00:04:17.299> i<00:04:17.420> think<00:04:17.450> in<00:04:17.690> the<00:04:17.750> song<00:04:17.930> um<00:04:18.200> but

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:18.709 
what it does i think in the song um but

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:20.350 
what it does i think in the song um but
it<00:04:18.830> doesn't<00:04:19.100> yeah<00:04:19.430> it's<00:04:19.700> just<00:04:19.850> the<00:04:19.940> bass<00:04:20.120> note

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:20.360 
it doesn't yeah it's just the bass note

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:23.500 
it doesn't yeah it's just the bass note
is<00:04:20.510> different<00:04:20.870> so<00:04:21.370> you're<00:04:22.370> mute<00:04:22.580> the<00:04:22.760> low<00:04:23.330> a

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:23.510 
is different so you're mute the low a

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:25.270 
is different so you're mute the low a
string<00:04:23.840> you're<00:04:24.140> muting<00:04:24.470> that<00:04:24.620> so<00:04:25.040> it<00:04:25.100> just

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:25.280 
string you're muting that so it just

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:27.850 
string you're muting that so it just
sounds<00:04:25.460> like<00:04:25.490> this<00:04:26.380> so<00:04:27.380> that's<00:04:27.560> the<00:04:27.680> correct

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:27.860 
sounds like this so that's the correct

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:31.000 
sounds like this so that's the correct
way<00:04:28.040> to<00:04:28.070> do<00:04:28.280> it<00:04:28.400> so<00:04:28.550> II<00:04:28.730> minor<00:04:29.350> do<00:04:30.350> your<00:04:30.500> f<00:04:30.770> sharp

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:31.010 
way to do it so II minor do your f sharp

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:33.850 
way to do it so II minor do your f sharp
so<00:04:31.640> that's<00:04:31.820> the<00:04:31.940> bass<00:04:32.090> note<00:04:32.300> do<00:04:32.600> you<00:04:32.630> extra<00:04:33.110> to

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:33.860 
so that's the bass note do you extra to

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:35.350 
so that's the bass note do you extra to
see

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:35.360 
see

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:37.149 
see
now<00:04:36.020> if<00:04:36.080> you<00:04:36.169> want<00:04:36.289> to<00:04:36.319> make<00:04:36.439> the<00:04:36.530> sea<00:04:36.770> even

00:04:37.149 --> 00:04:37.159 
now if you want to make the sea even

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:38.800 
now if you want to make the sea even
better<00:04:37.400> because<00:04:37.699> this<00:04:38.060> way<00:04:38.210> the<00:04:38.360> basement

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:38.810 
better because this way the basement

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:42.279 
better because this way the basement
walks<00:04:39.020> up<00:04:39.259> from<00:04:39.500> E<00:04:39.650> to<00:04:39.740> F<00:04:40.219> sharp<00:04:40.639> to<00:04:41.120> G<00:04:41.360> you<00:04:42.169> can

00:04:42.279 --> 00:04:42.289 
walks up from E to F sharp to G you can

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:43.779 
walks up from E to F sharp to G you can
actually<00:04:42.590> play<00:04:42.740> the<00:04:42.770> C<00:04:43.069> chord<00:04:43.310> look<00:04:43.610> at<00:04:43.699> this

00:04:43.779 --> 00:04:43.789 
actually play the C chord look at this

00:04:43.789 --> 00:04:45.909 
actually play the C chord look at this
like<00:04:44.000> this<00:04:44.180> this<00:04:44.750> is<00:04:44.810> a<00:04:44.930> regular<00:04:45.050> C<00:04:45.409> chord<00:04:45.680> but

00:04:45.909 --> 00:04:45.919 
like this this is a regular C chord but

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:48.730 
like this this is a regular C chord but
instead<00:04:46.370> put<00:04:46.969> your<00:04:47.120> pinky<00:04:47.629> at<00:04:47.810> the<00:04:48.259> third<00:04:48.469> fret

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:48.740 
instead put your pinky at the third fret

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:52.719 
instead put your pinky at the third fret
on<00:04:48.919> the<00:04:49.009> a<00:04:49.520> string<00:04:50.419> and<00:04:50.930> now<00:04:51.199> your<00:04:51.530> ring<00:04:52.520> finger

00:04:52.719 --> 00:04:52.729 
on the a string and now your ring finger

00:04:52.729 --> 00:04:55.619 
on the a string and now your ring finger
goes<00:04:53.090> at<00:04:53.389> the<00:04:53.449> third<00:04:53.900> fret<00:04:54.110> on<00:04:54.289> the<00:04:54.379> E<00:04:54.800> string

00:04:55.619 --> 00:04:55.629 
goes at the third fret on the E string

00:04:55.629 --> 00:04:57.939 
goes at the third fret on the E string
right<00:04:56.629> there<00:04:56.960> so<00:04:57.289> you're<00:04:57.439> actually<00:04:57.560> playing

00:04:57.939 --> 00:04:57.949 
right there so you're actually playing

00:04:57.949 --> 00:05:02.589 
right there so you're actually playing
all<00:04:58.189> of<00:04:58.250> the<00:04:58.819> strings<00:04:59.060> now<00:04:59.330> with<00:04:59.719> C<00:05:00.110> chord<00:05:01.599> and

00:05:02.589 --> 00:05:02.599 
all of the strings now with C chord and

00:05:02.599 --> 00:05:04.059 
all of the strings now with C chord and
now<00:05:02.810> you're<00:05:03.020> playing<00:05:03.110> the<00:05:03.319> fifth<00:05:03.590> in<00:05:03.770> the<00:05:03.889> base

00:05:04.059 --> 00:05:04.069 
now you're playing the fifth in the base

00:05:04.069 --> 00:05:05.800 
now you're playing the fifth in the base
so<00:05:04.580> it<00:05:04.669> actually<00:05:04.819> sounds<00:05:05.240> better<00:05:05.300> to<00:05:05.629> do<00:05:05.719> it

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:05.810 
so it actually sounds better to do it

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:10.119 
so it actually sounds better to do it
this<00:05:05.930> way<00:05:06.139> minor<00:05:07.060> D<00:05:08.060> everetts<00:05:08.419> I<00:05:08.650> see<00:05:09.650> with

00:07:00.009 --> 00:07:00.019 
really I think the best way to do it if

00:07:00.019 --> 00:07:01.600 
really I think the best way to do it if
you<00:07:00.169> want<00:07:00.289> to<00:07:00.379> make<00:07:00.499> it<00:07:00.649> a<00:07:00.679> little<00:07:00.919> bit<00:07:01.099> more

you want to make it a little bit more
upbeat<00:07:01.969> you<00:07:02.509> can<00:07:02.659> do<00:07:02.749> it<00:07:02.839> like<00:07:02.989> this

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:08.370 

00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:10.939 

which<00:07:08.970> is<00:07:09.150> it's<00:07:09.750> a<00:07:09.900> little<00:07:10.080> bit<00:07:10.169> faster<00:07:10.590> um

00:07:10.939 --> 00:07:10.949
