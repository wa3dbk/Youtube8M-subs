 with you forkman and the next top 10 at all 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.310
 I recently arranged for my group just 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.320
 next topic for the top link to it 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.510
 by the way there is in the description and won it 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.519
 top 10 balls but as you see i don't 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.019
 going to make the top 10 swords more accurately not 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.300
 now we will have the next 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.910
 the winner is the top 10 games in the universe 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.920
 marvel and they came out i will tell you a lot and 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.780
 I remember, of course, not everything, especially I 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.070
 I will release some old games but 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.020
 in the top they will still 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.790
 for I really adore them and put a little 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.690
 more modern games in first place 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.690
 Well, we start 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:55.000
 tenth place gets marvel heroes 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:56.890
 which came out in 2013 and after 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.590
 recent update called marvel 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:00.190
 heroes 2015 you can compare it with 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:01.809
 diablo 2 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:03.550
 but I don't think it will be correct. 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:05.320
 comparison game spreads by 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:06.910
 fritupley system that is the game itself 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.740
 free but there are items that 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:09.760
 you can buy for real money is 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:11.350
 my pg 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:13.360
 where is your main task to pump 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:14.979
 character level to maximum to choose 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.510
 There are more than 30 characters and 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:19.030
 the maximum level that you can 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:20.229
 reach is 60 characters here 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:21.729
 not divided into classes 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:23.500
 therefore by being a tank or 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:27.270
 healer can only player character 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.270
 who possesses precisely these skills 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:37.060
 diet place captain america nt and 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:38.920
 ventures in 1991 came on the Nez demolished 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:40.180
 mega drive bring with game gear and game boy 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.280
 that is a rather extensive list 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:44.080
 platforms genre for games easy to guess 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.000
 because it is a classic of bitemap 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:47.530
 marvel universe four heroes to choose from 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.360
 captain america iron man 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:51.100
 falcon eye and burned you will 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.479
 fight in different locations which 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:54.670
 include new york underwater world 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:56.229
 Atlantis and even on the lunar base of red 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.210
 skull in the game there is a mode for several 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:00.220
 players up to four in the arcade version and 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:02.080
 up to two console ones standard such 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:04.090
 the game from konami is very very beautiful from 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:10.149
 well- developed gameplay one of 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:12.940
 my favorite childhood games 8 place marvel 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:14.950
 ultimate alliance 2 part of a series based 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.690
 on a very epic marvel event like 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.610
 in the last part you type a command from 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:19.989
 four heroes between which you can 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:22.030
 switch during the game very 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:23.739
 reminds x-men legend compared to 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.600
 The first part is very improved combat 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:26.709
 the system is now two characters can 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.870
 join forces to fulfill 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:31.000
 more powerful attack for each character 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:32.860
 have their own unique reception and each of 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.790
 they are pumped separately getting new ones 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.790
 attack abilities 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:48.080
 seventh place x-men erkade and how much 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:50.210
 I remember she was in my top 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:51.950
 This is also a classic konami beatmap 

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:53.930
 based on the marvel universe in the game 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:55.790
 several characters have a great design and 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:03:00.860
 quite fun gameplay and still there 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:03.170
 hd reprint to new platforms 6 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:05.210

 able to jump on buildings and destroy 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:22.250
 these buildings in the big world game consisting 

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:23.900
 from two zones a city and a desert with combat 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:24.500
 bases you can go where 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:26.180
 want to 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:28.550
 the game has a completely open game world 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:31.270
 30 plots from 40 not obligatory tasks 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:31.270
 waiting for you 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:45.060
 fifth place and two thousandth spider-man 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:47.159
 years in 2000, a series of spiderman bought 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:49.109
 activision and this game is the first that came out 

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:50.959
 after this purchase about spiderman already 

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:53.069
 from activision went on playstation 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:55.319
 the development of this version was engaged in 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:56.370
 Versa then it reissued inscriptions already 

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:57.989
 studio gray matter 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:00.510
 and on several more platforms like 

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:02.069
 nintendo 64 and dreamcast for portable 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:03.930
 game boy platform created a separate 

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:06.150
 a game that was done in 2d and 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:07.620
 bore this name this practice often 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:09.420
 used in games when transferring to 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:11.400
 weaker platforms like game boy 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:13.620
 or ds different enemies good combat 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:18.449
 the system and the game itself has long been 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:19.289
 Classic 4 place Fight series marvel 

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:21.060
 vs capcom 

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:23.310
 where two meet face to face 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:25.979
 Universe more precisely capcom heroes fight 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:27.930
 with heroes capcom m marvel more precisely a game 

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:29.250
 created capcom for arcade machines and 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:31.259
 The series goes on to this day 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:32.430
 Already many games are interesting and 

00:04:31.259 --> 00:04:35.419
 beautiful fighting game series 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:35.419
 I highly recommend to get acquainted 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:49.530
 spider-man 2 opens the top three 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:51.810
 created by the film and it's a cool game 

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:54.780
 very cool game created by activision 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:57.450
 2004 for playstation 2 pc and xbox 

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:59.400
 The main enemy of the game is Otto Octavius 

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:01.650
 and spider-man knows everything that movies could do 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:03.840
 up the wall and spidery sensors for example 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:05.460
 and I can't say it never 

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:07.500
 listen to me carefully 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:09.630
 never run this game on pc 

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:13.160
 want to know why you can see 

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:13.160
 here is this review abstract on the screen 

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:18.360
 second place is x-men origin of full grain and 

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:20.730
 she didn't really deserve this place 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:22.770
 or deserved but this is to be solved 

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:24.570
 you through the heated debate as 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:26.010
 it is clear from the title to be 

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:28.050
 become logan and go through everything 

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:29.580
 storylines of the original movie about 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:31.920
 wolverine though with some reservations 

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:34.440
 that relate to the chronology of events 

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:36.180
 executed on unreal engine 3 issues 

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:37.890
 quite decent graphics and can 

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:39.360
 please your eye the gameplay is also not 

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:41.160
 especially diverse and pretty 

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:42.870
 monotonous but there are moments that are 

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:44.700
 the whole thing is diluted and shows new 

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:46.200
 sides of the game and it is they who make you 

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:48.660
 put a positive opinion on the game 

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:51.090
 came out on many platforms and these versions 

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:54.000
 among themselves often differ first 

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:56.010
 place and of course niche punisher depot 

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.840
 damn it and spit i wanted on opinions 

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:59.820
 critics this game is awesome 

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:01.320
 don't make me cry under you 

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:03.000
 control give frank caste 

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:05.010
 the image of which was formed from the image 

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.660
 presented in the movie about punisher even 

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:08.490
 the actor who played the punitive film 

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:09.990
 gave him his voice in the game all his 

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:12.120
 Frankie devoted his life to fighting 

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:14.610
 crime it drove him to death 

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:16.860
 7 at the hands of gangsters and he is to kill 

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:18.690
 not one hundred criminals kill them 

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:20.910
 right and left you can swim in 

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:22.180
 blood damn it feed 1 piraning 

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:24.160

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:28.090

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:29.889
 take always biased 

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:31.270
 but this game I liked so much 

00:06:29.889 --> 00:06:33.039
 what if the second part came out on 

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:36.669
 kickstarter I would first threw money 

00:06:33.039 --> 00:06:38.650
 all your money in general, you understand that their 

00:06:36.669 --> 00:06:40.840
 I strongly advise you to play it for 

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:42.910
 while quite playable though and passed 

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:44.830
 her 2 curling heading you can remember 

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:47.080
 something that did not hit the top but deserves 

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:49.240
 Mention this time you can remember 

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:50.650
 ultimate spider-man that didn't hit 

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:52.389
 top just because of what was already in 

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:55.050
 top this is also one of my most 

00:06:52.389 --> 00:06:55.050

00:06:57.270 --> 00:07:01.110

 deadpool she was also in another top well 

00:07:12.319 --> 00:07:15.679
