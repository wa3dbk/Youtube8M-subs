I try and keep what we're standing on
the<00:00:09.930> screen<00:00:10.110> as<00:00:10.260> possible<00:00:10.380> so<00:00:11.280> my<00:00:11.309> my<00:00:12.180> main

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
the screen as possible so my my main

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:14.840 
the screen as possible so my my main
task<00:00:12.630> is<00:00:12.980> was<00:00:13.980> really<00:00:14.220> the<00:00:14.340> maintenance<00:00:14.640> and

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:14.850 
task is was really the maintenance and

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:17.030 
task is was really the maintenance and
presentation<00:00:15.540> of<00:00:15.750> the<00:00:16.139> turf<00:00:16.350> surface<00:00:16.770> a<00:00:16.920> lot

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:17.040 
presentation of the turf surface a lot

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:19.040 
presentation of the turf surface a lot
of<00:00:17.130> people<00:00:17.340> wouldn't<00:00:17.550> know<00:00:17.640> that<00:00:17.670> it's<00:00:18.060> it's

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
of people wouldn't know that it's it's

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.100 
of people wouldn't know that it's it's
at<00:00:19.380> least<00:00:19.590> 50%<00:00:20.099> artificial<00:00:21.000> and<00:00:21.150> the<00:00:21.779> rest<00:00:21.960> is

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:22.110 
at least 50% artificial and the rest is

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:24.800 
at least 50% artificial and the rest is
natural<00:00:22.470> -<00:00:22.710> we've<00:00:23.189> got<00:00:23.430> ten<00:00:24.090> portal<00:00:24.509> wickets

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
natural - we've got ten portal wickets

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.900 
natural - we've got ten portal wickets
so<00:00:24.960> they're<00:00:25.110> a<00:00:25.140> metal<00:00:25.470> frame<00:00:25.710> tub<00:00:26.250> they<00:00:26.700> sit<00:00:26.880> on

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
so they're a metal frame tub they sit on

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.409 
so they're a metal frame tub they sit on
a<00:00:27.029> concrete<00:00:27.450> pad<00:00:27.810> out<00:00:28.230> in<00:00:28.470> the<00:00:28.560> middle<00:00:28.770> of<00:00:28.829> the

a concrete pad out in the middle of the

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:32.720 
a concrete pad out in the middle of the
MCG<00:00:30.419> and<00:00:30.689> each<00:00:31.020> year<00:00:31.320> we<00:00:32.009> install<00:00:32.310> them<00:00:32.489> and

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
MCG and each year we install them and

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.270 
MCG and each year we install them and
this<00:00:32.970> time<00:00:33.210> of<00:00:33.360> year<00:00:33.480> we<00:00:33.600> have<00:00:33.630> to<00:00:34.130> take<00:00:35.130> them

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
this time of year we have to take them

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.520 
this time of year we have to take them
out<00:00:35.399> again<00:00:35.460> so<00:00:35.940> we<00:00:36.510> try<00:00:36.690> and<00:00:36.720> do<00:00:36.870> that<00:00:37.020> over<00:00:37.230> two

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
out again so we try and do that over two

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.319 
out again so we try and do that over two
or<00:00:37.559> three<00:00:37.859> nights<00:00:38.010> there's<00:00:38.789> technology

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
or three nights there's technology

concept<00:01:02.820> has<00:01:03.390> been<00:01:03.600> around<00:01:03.780> for<00:01:03.989> a<00:01:04.019> long<00:01:04.140> time

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
concept has been around for a long time

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.010

but<00:01:04.559> only<00:01:04.680> in<00:01:04.860> Australia<00:01:04.949> we've<00:01:05.810> refined<00:01:06.810> it

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
but only in Australia we've refined it

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.200 
but only in Australia we've refined it
in-house<00:01:07.409> we've<00:01:07.800> got<00:01:07.980> a<00:01:08.010> guy<00:01:08.190> whose<00:01:08.580> job<00:01:09.000> is

in-house we've got a guy whose job is
turf<00:01:09.630> development<00:01:10.230> and<00:01:10.470> he's<00:01:10.680> come<00:01:10.920> up<00:01:11.040> with

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:11.190 
turf development and he's come up with

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:13.670 
turf development and he's come up with
our<00:01:11.340> own<00:01:11.490> unique<00:01:12.030> design<00:01:12.210> for<00:01:12.660> trees<00:01:12.900> etc<00:01:13.140> we

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
our own unique design for trees etc we

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.040 
our own unique design for trees etc we
still<00:01:13.920> use<00:01:14.250> an<00:01:15.120> outside<00:01:15.450> company<00:01:15.870> to

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:16.050 
still use an outside company to

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:17.900 
still use an outside company to
transport<00:01:16.950> them<00:01:17.100> around<00:01:17.190> there's<00:01:17.610> a<00:01:17.730> few

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:17.910 
transport them around there's a few

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:19.250 
transport them around there's a few
stadiums<00:01:18.270> which<00:01:18.420> have<00:01:18.570> sought<00:01:18.780> our<00:01:18.960> advice

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:19.260 
stadiums which have sought our advice

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.040 
stadiums which have sought our advice
which<00:01:19.560> is<00:01:19.590> fairly<00:01:20.430> natural<00:01:20.760> since<00:01:20.970> we<00:01:21.150> we've

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:22.050 
which is fairly natural since we we've

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:23.980 
which is fairly natural since we we've
been<00:01:22.230> doing<00:01:22.440> this<00:01:22.560> since<00:01:22.620> the<00:01:22.980> year<00:01:23.130> 2000<00:01:23.760> so

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:23.990 
been doing this since the year 2000 so

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:26.090 
been doing this since the year 2000 so
we've<00:01:24.990> probably<00:01:25.170> made<00:01:25.410> more<00:01:25.620> mistakes<00:01:25.770> than

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
we've probably made more mistakes than

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.650 
we've probably made more mistakes than
most<00:01:26.370> so<00:01:26.580> if<00:01:26.700> you're<00:01:26.910> going<00:01:27.030> to<00:01:27.120> ask<00:01:27.270> anyone

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:27.660 
most so if you're going to ask anyone

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:29.930 
most so if you're going to ask anyone
then<00:01:27.930> we're<00:01:28.860> not<00:01:28.980> a<00:01:29.040> bad<00:01:29.250> place<00:01:29.520> to<00:01:29.550> start

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:29.940 
then we're not a bad place to start

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:31.280 
then we're not a bad place to start
because<00:01:30.120> he<00:01:30.270> used<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:30.600> portal<00:01:30.870> idiots<00:01:31.140> is

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
because he used the portal idiots is

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:32.690 
because he used the portal idiots is
made<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:32.130> venue

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700
