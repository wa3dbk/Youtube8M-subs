00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
less than retail you can do this in a

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.500 
less than retail you can do this in a
couple<00:00:44.160> of<00:00:44.340> different<00:00:44.609> ways<00:00:44.730> so<00:00:45.090> number<00:00:45.329> one

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
couple of different ways so number one

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.090 
couple of different ways so number one
one<00:00:45.750> way<00:00:45.899> you<00:00:45.960> can<00:00:46.109> do<00:00:46.230> this<00:00:46.410> is<00:00:46.589> by<00:00:46.710> hooking<00:00:47.010> up

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
one way you can do this is by hooking up

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.680 
one way you can do this is by hooking up
with<00:00:47.219> a<00:00:47.280> store<00:00:47.550> owner<00:00:47.760> of<00:00:48.059> your<00:00:48.269> locals

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
with a store owner of your locals

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.349 
with a store owner of your locals
obviously<00:00:49.350> they<00:00:50.129> buy<00:00:50.370> stuff<00:00:50.429> for<00:00:50.879> less<00:00:51.089> than

00:00:51.349 --> 00:00:51.359 
obviously they buy stuff for less than

00:00:51.359 --> 00:00:53.209 
obviously they buy stuff for less than
retail<00:00:51.510> otherwise<00:00:51.989> there<00:00:52.350> was<00:00:52.530> no<00:00:52.800> way<00:00:52.980> their

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
retail otherwise there was no way their

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.029 
retail otherwise there was no way their
store<00:00:53.489> could<00:00:53.699> stay<00:00:53.910> afloat<00:00:54.210> and<00:00:54.480> if<00:00:55.320> you<00:00:55.469> let

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
store could stay afloat and if you let

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.799 
store could stay afloat and if you let
them<00:00:56.070> know<00:00:56.370> that<00:00:56.820> when<00:00:57.179> they<00:00:57.329> purchase

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
them know that when they purchase

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.479 
them know that when they purchase
whatever<00:00:58.140> amount<00:00:58.710> of<00:00:58.859> product<00:00:59.159> they're<00:00:59.280> going

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
whatever amount of product they're going

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.669 
whatever amount of product they're going
to<00:00:59.640> if<00:01:00.030> they<00:01:00.239> can<00:01:00.390> add<00:01:00.570> one<00:01:00.899> extra<00:01:01.079> case<00:01:01.440> on

00:01:01.669 --> 00:01:01.679 
to if they can add one extra case on

00:01:01.679 --> 00:01:04.130 
to if they can add one extra case on
there<00:01:01.890> for<00:01:02.730> yourself<00:01:03.210> maybe<00:01:03.629> they<00:01:03.839> will<00:01:03.989> do

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
there for yourself maybe they will do

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.420 
there for yourself maybe they will do
that<00:01:04.320> for<00:01:04.500> you<00:01:04.620> if<00:01:04.739> you've<00:01:04.860> got<00:01:04.890> some<00:01:05.220> kind<00:01:05.400> of

good rapport with them or something of

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.890 
good rapport with them or something of
that<00:01:07.770> nature<00:01:07.920> for<00:01:08.460> myself<00:01:09.120> I<00:01:09.300> went<00:01:09.570> ahead<00:01:09.720> and

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
that nature for myself I went ahead and

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.340 
that nature for myself I went ahead and
hooked<00:01:10.290> up<00:01:10.380> directly<00:01:10.800> with<00:01:11.159> a<00:01:11.190> vendor<00:01:11.790> who<00:01:12.350> you

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
only way that I'm able to do this is

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.770 
only way that I'm able to do this is
back<00:01:28.380> in<00:01:28.560> the<00:01:28.649> day<00:01:28.829> I<00:01:29.100> used<00:01:29.610> to<00:01:29.729> buy<00:01:29.880> a<00:01:30.149> lot<00:01:30.600> of

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:34.670 
cases a ton of them really every time I
set<00:01:33.299> would<00:01:33.450> come<00:01:33.630> out<00:01:33.719> almost<00:01:34.200> as<00:01:34.530> much

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200

want to give you a quick example of what
we<00:03:33.700> did<00:03:33.940> we<00:03:34.329> ended<00:03:34.569> up<00:03:34.690> purchasing<00:03:35.170> our<00:03:35.380> case

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620 
we did we ended up purchasing our case

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:38.220 
we did we ended up purchasing our case
of<00:03:35.650> the<00:03:35.980> megatons<00:03:36.370> for<00:03:36.730> $150<00:03:37.720> so<00:03:38.079> that

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.230 
of the megatons for $150 so that

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:41.729 
of the megatons for $150 so that
averaged<00:03:38.590> out<00:03:38.799> to<00:03:38.859> about<00:03:39.989> $12.50<00:03:40.989> roughly<00:03:41.500> for

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:41.739 
averaged out to about $12.50 roughly for

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:43.650 
averaged out to about $12.50 roughly for
each<00:03:41.889> tin<00:03:42.250> that<00:03:42.430> we<00:03:42.549> pay<00:03:42.790> which<00:03:43.329> is<00:03:43.359> pretty

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:43.660 
each tin that we pay which is pretty

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:45.180 
each tin that we pay which is pretty
good<00:03:43.840> so<00:03:44.079> all<00:03:44.230> we<00:03:44.350> got<00:03:44.470> to<00:03:44.560> do<00:03:44.650> to<00:03:44.769> make<00:03:44.920> up<00:03:45.040> the

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:45.190 
good so all we got to do to make up the

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:48.390 
good so all we got to do to make up the
value<00:03:45.549> of<00:03:45.639> those<00:03:45.760> tins<00:03:46.060> is<00:03:46.450> get<00:03:46.980> $12.50<00:03:47.980> out<00:03:48.250> of

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 
value of those tins is get $12.50 out of

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:51.210 
value of those tins is get $12.50 out of
each<00:03:48.549> one<00:03:48.819> so<00:03:49.030> we<00:03:49.510> pulled<00:03:49.780> just<00:03:50.079> three<00:03:50.530> $5

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:51.220 
each one so we pulled just three $5

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:53.670 
each one so we pulled just three $5
cards<00:03:51.700> essentially<00:03:52.420> we've<00:03:53.049> already<00:03:53.319> made

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:53.680 
cards essentially we've already made

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:56.309 
cards essentially we've already made
profit<00:03:54.220> off<00:03:54.370> of<00:03:54.430> that<00:03:54.760> tin<00:03:55.030> so<00:03:55.480> obviously<00:03:55.989> once

00:03:56.309 --> 00:03:56.319 
profit off of that tin so obviously once

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:58.500 
profit off of that tin so obviously once
