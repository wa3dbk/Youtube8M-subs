across<00:03:57.739> I'll<00:03:58.040> just<00:03:58.159> hide<00:03:58.370> off<00:03:58.579> to<00:03:58.849> it<00:03:59.109> to<00:04:00.109> the

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:00.200 
across I'll just hide off to it to the

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:03.250 
across I'll just hide off to it to the
treatment<00:04:00.650> here<00:04:00.799> so<00:04:01.720> all<00:04:02.720> right<00:04:02.930> everything's

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:03.260 
treatment here so all right everything's
