really<00:02:41.140> thing<00:02:41.400> anything<00:02:42.400> really<00:02:42.550> special

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
really thing anything really special

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.290 
really thing anything really special
about<00:02:43.150> it<00:02:44.340> except<00:02:45.340> though<00:02:45.520> for<00:02:45.850> a<00:02:45.880> designer<00:02:46.209> I

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:46.300 
about it except though for a designer I

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:47.640 
about it except though for a designer I
think<00:02:46.480> because<00:02:46.690> it<00:02:46.810> looks<00:02:46.959> flip<00:02:47.200> this<00:02:47.320> in<00:02:47.470> half

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
think because it looks flip this in half

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:48.870 
think because it looks flip this in half
so<00:02:47.980> it<00:02:48.100> doesn't<00:02:48.340> look<00:02:48.430> like<00:02:48.580> he's<00:02:48.730> wearing

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880 
so it doesn't look like he's wearing

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.270 
so it doesn't look like he's wearing
like<00:02:49.000> one<00:02:49.239> slipper<00:02:49.810> or<00:02:49.930> one<00:02:50.110> foot<00:02:50.380> but

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
like one slipper or one foot but

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.840 
like one slipper or one foot but
whatever

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:51.850 
whatever

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:57.750 
whatever
so<00:02:52.810> that's<00:02:53.110> Mike<00:02:53.260> Wazowski<00:02:55.770> then<00:02:56.770> we<00:02:56.890> have<00:02:57.100> the

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
so that's Mike Wazowski then we have the

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.940 
so that's Mike Wazowski then we have the
guy<00:02:58.000> from<00:02:58.480> cars<00:02:58.840> don't<00:02:59.110> really<00:02:59.380> remember<00:02:59.650> his

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
guy from cars don't really remember his

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:02.880 
guy from cars don't really remember his
name<00:03:00.100> either<00:03:00.280> but<00:03:01.120> it's<00:03:01.780> the<00:03:01.900> giant<00:03:02.500> bad<00:03:02.650> guy
