 Hey! 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:15.510
 Today I have to present a modern, multimedia tablet, 

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:19.140
 which can change into a remote control. 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:23.550
 Thanks to PlayStation certification and a powerful processor 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.840
 will also work as a portable gaming console. 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:31.160
 First Sony Xperia S drew my attention 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.050
 an unusual housing resembling a folded newspaper. 

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:38.000
 Thanks to this, he is really comfortable with it. 

00:00:38.193 --> 00:00:43.173
 Nevertheless, the Sony Xperia S divides the light years from the paper newspaper. 

00:00:43.666 --> 00:00:48.946
 The device is equipped with the popular NVIDIA Tegra 3 quad-core mobile processor, 

00:00:49.246 --> 00:00:53.306
 1 GB of RAM and 32 GB of memory for data. 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:59.206
 Unusually for the tablet Sony Xperia S has a 9.4 inch screen diagonal 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:03.320
 and the 16:10 format, not the more common 16: 9. 

00:01:03.686 --> 00:01:09.146
 However, the resolution of the matrix itself is standard 1280x800px. 

00:01:10.026 --> 00:01:13.740
 The producer also made sure that the screen does not look like a mirror. 

00:01:14.226 --> 00:01:18.100
 The viewing angles are wide, so no distorted colors appear 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.873
 even if you do not look at the screen perpendicular. 

00:01:21.266 --> 00:01:24.706
 The weight and size of the device perfectly suits your needs 

00:01:24.706 --> 00:01:28.060
 most of the typical users of this type of mobile devices. 

00:01:28.806 --> 00:01:33.126
 Sony has decided to change the usual customized look of tablets 

00:01:33.286 --> 00:01:36.180
 and created a device with an asymmetrical form. 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.813
 Thanks to this, numerous bends appeared in the housing, in which: 

00:01:40.813 --> 00:01:44.280
 On the right side, the switch and volume control button; 

00:01:44.666 --> 00:01:48.126
 Between the buttons - a diode informing about charging; 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.673
 On the left - secured slots for memory card, sim card 

00:01:52.673 --> 00:01:55.286
 and a 3.5 mm headphone connector. 

00:01:56.113 --> 00:02:00.246
 Two loudspeakers are placed on the back of the tablet, at the bottom, on the sides, 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:06.173
 in the middle, and protected by a special plug of the multifunction port 

00:02:06.173 --> 00:02:09.000
 - for charging or connecting the device with a computer. 

00:02:10.426 --> 00:02:13.040
 Just - two plugs, 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.606
 protecting the two largest "openings" in the S Tablet from Sony, 

00:02:17.606 --> 00:02:20.013
 they protect it from splashing. 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.286
 This does not mean that the equipment is completely waterproof. 

00:02:24.286 --> 00:02:26.426
 I do not advise you to come into the bath with him. 

00:02:26.426 --> 00:02:29.566
 But a light drizzle will not hurt him. 

00:02:30.013 --> 00:02:32.493
 However, let's go back to the description of the device.
