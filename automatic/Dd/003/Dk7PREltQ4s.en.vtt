00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:27.070 
usual French named Vivian Jerry this was

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:29.040 
usual French named Vivian Jerry this was
the<00:03:27.340> call<00:03:27.760> that<00:03:27.970> I<00:03:28.000> figured<00:03:28.540> would<00:03:28.750> match<00:03:29.020> my

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:29.050 
the call that I figured would match my

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:33.300 
the call that I figured would match my
hair<00:03:29.650> the<00:03:29.830> best<00:03:30.510> what<00:03:31.510> do<00:03:31.570> you<00:03:31.600> think<00:03:32.310> you

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
hair the best what do you think you

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:34.410 
hair the best what do you think you
think<00:03:33.460> there's<00:03:33.760> something<00:03:33.940> better<00:03:34.180> out<00:03:34.300> there

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:34.420 
think there's something better out there

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:37.320 
think there's something better out there
let<00:03:35.380> me<00:03:35.470> know<00:03:35.620> but<00:03:36.520> I<00:03:36.550> figured<00:03:37.030> that<00:03:37.180> this

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:37.330 
let me know but I figured that this

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:40.680 
let me know but I figured that this
would<00:03:37.540> do<00:03:38.140> the<00:03:38.320> best<00:03:38.530> for<00:03:38.860> now<00:03:39.330> so<00:03:40.330> I<00:03:40.360> got<00:03:40.420> two

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:40.690 
would do the best for now so I got two

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:42.840 
would do the best for now so I got two
