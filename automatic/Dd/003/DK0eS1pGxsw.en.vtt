Barcelona this year as you can see
there's<00:00:19.010> some<00:00:19.250> wedges<00:00:19.730> around<00:00:20.359> the<00:00:20.449> defender

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:20.900 
there's some wedges around the defender

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:22.390 
there's some wedges around the defender
who's<00:00:21.259> in<00:00:21.619> possession<00:00:21.949> of<00:00:22.039> the<00:00:22.130> ball<00:00:22.160> at<00:00:22.339> the

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:22.400 
who's in possession of the ball at the

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.370 
who's in possession of the ball at the
beginning<00:00:22.730> of<00:00:22.820> the<00:00:22.939> video<00:00:23.029> and<00:00:23.419> these<00:00:23.900> wedges

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:24.380 
beginning of the video and these wedges

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:26.800 
beginning of the video and these wedges
is<00:00:25.339> what<00:00:25.550> we're<00:00:25.699> calling<00:00:25.849> the<00:00:26.150> vision<00:00:26.449> map<00:00:26.599> and

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:26.810 
is what we're calling the vision map and

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:28.900 
is what we're calling the vision map and
it's<00:00:27.380> the<00:00:27.499> concept<00:00:27.980> that<00:00:28.039> we've<00:00:28.249> created<00:00:28.429> to

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:28.910 
it's the concept that we've created to

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:31.899 
it's the concept that we've created to
try<00:00:29.119> to<00:00:29.179> create<00:00:29.539> this<00:00:29.810> behavior<00:00:30.609> you<00:00:31.609> can<00:00:31.759> see

00:00:31.899 --> 00:00:31.909 
try to create this behavior you can see

00:00:31.909 --> 00:00:33.520 
try to create this behavior you can see
that<00:00:31.939> the<00:00:32.180> founders<00:00:32.480> vision<00:00:32.509> map<00:00:32.930> is<00:00:33.140> not<00:00:33.320> very

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:33.530 
that the founders vision map is not very

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:36.580 
that the founders vision map is not very
big<00:00:33.770> he<00:00:34.610> doesn't<00:00:34.820> have<00:00:34.880> a<00:00:34.940> lot<00:00:35.090> of<00:00:35.590> vision

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:36.590 
big he doesn't have a lot of vision

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:39.730 
big he doesn't have a lot of vision
behind<00:00:36.740> him<00:00:37.190> and<00:00:37.990> he<00:00:38.990> doesn't<00:00:39.320> see<00:00:39.470> all<00:00:39.620> the

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:39.740 
behind him and he doesn't see all the

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:41.260 
behind him and he doesn't see all the
opportunities<00:00:40.250> that<00:00:40.280> are<00:00:40.490> presented<00:00:40.730> in<00:00:41.180> a

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:41.270 
opportunities that are presented in a

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:44.920 
opportunities that are presented in a
play<00:00:41.450> at<00:00:41.510> a<00:00:42.140> given<00:00:42.290> moment<00:00:43.030> but<00:00:44.030> now<00:00:44.210> when<00:00:44.840> we

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:44.930 
play at a given moment but now when we

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:46.960 
play at a given moment but now when we
run<00:00:44.960> the<00:00:45.230> video<00:00:45.470> and<00:00:45.800> he<00:00:46.430> passes<00:00:46.610> the<00:00:46.820> ball<00:00:46.910> to

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:46.970 
run the video and he passes the ball to

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:48.430 
run the video and he passes the ball to
Fabregas<00:00:47.480> who<00:00:47.660> is<00:00:47.780> around<00:00:47.930> the<00:00:48.050> middle<00:00:48.260> of<00:00:48.350> the

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:48.440 
Fabregas who is around the middle of the

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.010 
Fabregas who is around the middle of the
field<00:00:48.620> as<00:00:48.950> he<00:00:49.640> gets<00:00:49.880> it<00:00:50.090> you<00:00:50.300> can<00:00:50.480> see<00:00:50.660> that<00:00:50.870> his

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:51.020 
field as he gets it you can see that his

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:52.900 
field as he gets it you can see that his
vision<00:00:51.350> map<00:00:51.500> is<00:00:51.680> much<00:00:51.860> much<00:00:52.070> larger<00:00:52.340> and<00:00:52.670> this

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:52.910 
vision map is much much larger and this

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:55.390 
vision map is much much larger and this
is<00:00:53.060> because<00:00:53.240> of<00:00:53.780> his<00:00:54.410> vision<00:00:54.710> attributes<00:00:55.190> and

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:55.400 
is because of his vision attributes and

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.400 
is because of his vision attributes and
now<00:00:55.910> this<00:00:56.060> vision<00:00:56.420> map<00:00:56.570> changes<00:00:57.080> in<00:00:57.230> a<00:00:57.290> variety

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:57.410 
now this vision map changes in a variety

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:59.260 
now this vision map changes in a variety
of<00:00:57.680> things<00:00:57.980> the<00:00:58.610> opportunities<00:00:59.120> and<00:00:59.240> threats

00:00:59.260 --> 00:00:59.270 
of things the opportunities and threats

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:02.980 
of things the opportunities and threats
that<00:00:59.600> i<00:00:59.630> mentioned<00:01:00.110> affect<00:01:01.030> how<00:01:02.030> much<00:01:02.060> the<00:01:02.570> the

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:02.990 
that i mentioned affect how much the the

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:04.840 
that i mentioned affect how much the the
vision<00:01:03.440> map<00:01:03.560> slows<00:01:03.830> down<00:01:04.100> as<00:01:04.369> it<00:01:04.489> hits<00:01:04.699> that

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:04.850 
vision map slows down as it hits that

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:08.139 
vision map slows down as it hits that
player<00:01:05.439> it<00:01:06.439> also<00:01:06.619> division<00:01:07.549> attribute<00:01:07.999> also

00:01:08.139 --> 00:01:08.149 
player it also division attribute also

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:10.779 
player it also division attribute also
affects<00:01:08.450> how<00:01:08.630> how<00:01:09.049> big<00:01:09.859> the<00:01:10.070> vision<00:01:10.280> map<00:01:10.429> is<00:01:10.579> in

00:01:10.779 --> 00:01:10.789 
affects how how big the vision map is in

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:14.169 
affects how how big the vision map is in
general<00:01:11.049> in<00:01:12.049> terms<00:01:12.350> of<00:01:12.560> the<00:01:12.880> angle<00:01:13.880> that<00:01:14.030> he

00:01:14.169 --> 00:01:14.179 
general in terms of the angle that he

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:16.060 
general in terms of the angle that he
can<00:01:14.329> see<00:01:14.539> in<00:01:14.810> terms<00:01:15.380> of<00:01:15.469> how<00:01:15.590> much<00:01:15.859> he

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:16.070 
can see in terms of how much he

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:17.260 
can see in terms of how much he
remembers<00:01:16.490> after<00:01:16.789> seeing<00:01:17.090> an<00:01:17.179> opportunity

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:17.270 
remembers after seeing an opportunity

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:19.179 
remembers after seeing an opportunity
and<00:01:18.140> all<00:01:18.320> these<00:01:18.499> different<00:01:18.649> things<00:01:18.829> that

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:19.189 
and all these different things that

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:21.010 
and all these different things that
create<00:01:19.369> a<00:01:19.429> very<00:01:19.670> very<00:01:19.909> sophisticated<00:01:20.240> system

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:21.020 
create a very very sophisticated system

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.380 
create a very very sophisticated system
to<00:01:21.409> really<00:01:21.649> replicate<00:01:22.100> the<00:01:22.880> behavior<00:01:23.359> of

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:23.390 
to really replicate the behavior of

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:25.899 
to really replicate the behavior of
players<00:01:23.719> like<00:01:23.840> Fabregas<00:01:24.380> and<00:01:24.409> shabby<00:01:24.819> so<00:01:25.819> you

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:25.909 
players like Fabregas and shabby so you

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:27.130 
players like Fabregas and shabby so you
can<00:01:25.999> see<00:01:26.090> when<00:01:26.240> Fabregas<00:01:26.539> gets<00:01:26.749> it<00:01:26.929> and<00:01:27.020> he's

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:27.140 
can see when Fabregas gets it and he's

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.010 
can see when Fabregas gets it and he's
turning<00:01:27.350> around<00:01:27.789> his<00:01:28.789> wedges<00:01:29.240> now<00:01:29.689> already

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
turning around his wedges now already

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:31.300 
turning around his wedges now already
covered<00:01:30.439> the<00:01:30.590> opportunity<00:01:31.069> that<00:01:31.189> he's

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
covered the opportunity that he's

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:33.069 
covered the opportunity that he's
actually<00:01:31.490> going<00:01:31.759> to<00:01:31.850> capitalise<00:01:32.329> on<00:01:32.359> and<00:01:32.780> that

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:33.079 
actually going to capitalise on and that

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:35.709 
actually going to capitalise on and that
he<00:01:33.200> actually<00:01:33.350> did<00:01:33.710> in<00:01:33.979> the<00:01:34.759> real-life<00:01:34.969> example

00:01:35.709 --> 00:01:35.719 
he actually did in the real-life example

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:40.480 
he actually did in the real-life example
and<00:01:36.609> this<00:01:37.609> this<00:01:37.880> path<00:01:38.299> then<00:01:38.569> creates<00:01:39.069> this<00:01:40.069> an

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 
and this this path then creates this an

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:43.899 
and this this path then creates this an
amazing<00:01:40.909> opportunity<00:01:41.149> to<00:01:41.450> score<00:01:42.460> now<00:01:43.460> when<00:01:43.789> we

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:43.909 
amazing opportunity to score now when we

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:47.319 
amazing opportunity to score now when we
run<00:01:43.939> the<00:01:44.740> test<00:01:45.740> again<00:01:45.889> by<00:01:46.700> keeping<00:01:46.909> all<00:01:47.209> the

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:47.329 
run the test again by keeping all the

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:49.779 
run the test again by keeping all the
variables<00:01:47.659> the<00:01:48.319> same<00:01:48.649> but<00:01:49.189> only<00:01:49.429> substituting

00:01:49.779 --> 00:01:49.789 
variables the same but only substituting

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:52.359 
variables the same but only substituting
Fabregas<00:01:50.539> for<00:01:50.719> another<00:01:51.170> player<00:01:51.590> in<00:01:51.859> this<00:01:52.189> case

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:52.369 
Fabregas for another player in this case

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:54.580 
Fabregas for another player in this case
is<00:01:52.490> jay<00:01:52.700> is<00:01:52.819> five<00:01:53.030> for<00:01:53.209> Manchester<00:01:53.600> United<00:01:53.630> you

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 
is jay is five for Manchester United you

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:56.559 
is jay is five for Manchester United you
can<00:01:54.709> see<00:01:54.799> that<00:01:54.829> the<00:01:55.549> outcome<00:01:56.149> is<00:01:56.209> going<00:01:56.389> to<00:01:56.479> be

00:01:56.559 --> 00:01:56.569 
can see that the outcome is going to be

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:58.539 
can see that the outcome is going to be
different<00:01:56.810> the<00:01:57.590> first<00:01:57.799> defender<00:01:58.130> is<00:01:58.219> the<00:01:58.310> same

00:01:58.539 --> 00:01:58.549 
different the first defender is the same

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:00.370 
different the first defender is the same
these<00:01:58.999> wedges<00:01:59.240> are<00:01:59.450> the<00:01:59.509> same<00:01:59.749> he<00:01:59.959> passes<00:02:00.259> to

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:00.380 
these wedges are the same he passes to

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.459 
these wedges are the same he passes to
park<00:02:00.649> and<00:02:00.950> you<00:02:01.310> can<00:02:01.459> see<00:02:01.670> that<00:02:01.969> parks<00:02:02.719> vision

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:03.469 
park and you can see that parks vision

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:05.949 
park and you can see that parks vision
map<00:02:03.649> is<00:02:03.859> much<00:02:04.609> larger<00:02:04.819> than<00:02:04.999> the<00:02:05.149> defender<00:02:05.600> but

00:02:05.949 --> 00:02:05.959 
map is much larger than the defender but

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:08.680 
map is much larger than the defender but
it's<00:02:06.109> not<00:02:06.170> quite<00:02:06.409> as<00:02:06.649> big<00:02:06.920> as<00:02:07.189> an<00:02:08.119> encompassing

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
it's not quite as big as an encompassing

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:12.280 
it's not quite as big as an encompassing
as<00:02:09.200> Fabregas<00:02:10.300> because<00:02:11.300> of<00:02:11.420> this<00:02:11.540> as<00:02:11.810> he<00:02:11.989> turns

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
as Fabregas because of this as he turns

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:13.270 
as Fabregas because of this as he turns
he's<00:02:12.920> not

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
he's not

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.120 
he's not
yet<00:02:13.550> ready<00:02:14.330> to<00:02:14.900> make<00:02:15.050> that<00:02:15.080> pass<00:02:15.470> he<00:02:15.770> hasn't

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
yet ready to make that pass he hasn't

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:18.160 
yet ready to make that pass he hasn't
seen<00:02:16.370> that<00:02:16.580> opportunity<00:02:17.120> yet<00:02:17.330> up<00:02:17.569> the<00:02:17.900> field

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
seen that opportunity yet up the field

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:19.990 
seen that opportunity yet up the field
so<00:02:18.709> he's<00:02:18.920> still<00:02:19.040> considering<00:02:19.520> other<00:02:19.610> things

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
so he's still considering other things

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.820 
so he's still considering other things
and<00:02:20.300> eventually<00:02:21.080> he<00:02:21.110> does<00:02:21.380> you<00:02:21.560> can<00:02:21.680> see<00:02:21.800> that

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:21.830 
and eventually he does you can see that

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:23.590 
and eventually he does you can see that
the<00:02:21.980> vision<00:02:22.370> map<00:02:22.520> eventually<00:02:22.790> gets<00:02:23.330> to<00:02:23.480> that

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:23.600 
the vision map eventually gets to that

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.990 
the vision map eventually gets to that
place<00:02:23.840> of<00:02:24.020> the<00:02:24.110> field<00:02:24.350> but<00:02:25.040> now<00:02:25.610> it's<00:02:25.790> too<00:02:25.970> late

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
place of the field but now it's too late

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.420 
place of the field but now it's too late
he<00:02:26.510> takes<00:02:26.750> two<00:02:27.080> touches<00:02:27.319> on<00:02:27.530> the<00:02:27.620> ball<00:02:27.650> as<00:02:28.040> it

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
he takes two touches on the ball as it

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.010 
he takes two touches on the ball as it
takes<00:02:28.580> time<00:02:28.880> for<00:02:28.910> him<00:02:29.180> to<00:02:29.209> see<00:02:29.540> the<00:02:29.569> whole<00:02:29.840> play

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.020 
takes time for him to see the whole play

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:32.140 
takes time for him to see the whole play
develop<00:02:30.500> and<00:02:30.680> when<00:02:31.069> he<00:02:31.160> plays<00:02:31.400> the<00:02:31.550> past<00:02:31.790> the

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
develop and when he plays the past the

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:33.520 
develop and when he plays the past the
defender<00:02:32.300> is<00:02:32.720> actually<00:02:33.020> the<00:02:33.110> one<00:02:33.140> that<00:02:33.290> ends

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 
defender is actually the one that ends

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:35.170 
defender is actually the one that ends
up<00:02:33.620> with<00:02:33.800> the<00:02:33.890> ball<00:02:34.100> because<00:02:34.610> the<00:02:34.819> attacker

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
up with the ball because the attacker

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.260 
up with the ball because the attacker
has<00:02:35.420> now<00:02:35.510> given<00:02:35.690> up<00:02:35.959> on<00:02:36.110> it<00:02:36.170> and<00:02:36.940> as<00:02:37.940> you<00:02:38.150> can

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:38.270 
has now given up on it and as you can

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:40.600 
has now given up on it and as you can
see<00:02:38.300> it's<00:02:38.569> a<00:02:38.690> subtle<00:02:39.020> difference<00:02:39.340> but<00:02:40.340> it

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
see it's a subtle difference but it

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:42.580 
see it's a subtle difference but it
makes<00:02:41.480> a<00:02:41.660> world<00:02:41.840> of<00:02:42.080> difference<00:02:42.140> when<00:02:42.560> it

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
makes a world of difference when it

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:44.410 
makes a world of difference when it
comes<00:02:42.709> to<00:02:43.340> the<00:02:43.459> outcome<00:02:43.790> of<00:02:43.850> a<00:02:43.970> play<00:02:44.000> and

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
comes to the outcome of a play and

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:45.820 
comes to the outcome of a play and
that's<00:02:44.870> what<00:02:44.959> we're<00:02:45.050> going<00:02:45.170> to<00:02:45.230> have<00:02:45.410> in<00:02:45.650> this

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:45.830 
that's what we're going to have in this

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:48.340 
that's what we're going to have in this
series<00:02:46.040> game
