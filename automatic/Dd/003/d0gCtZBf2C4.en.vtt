is an inch that up here it's like an

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.789 
is an inch that up here it's like an
inch<00:02:46.040> and<00:02:46.220> a<00:02:46.280> half<00:02:46.810> and<00:02:47.810> I<00:02:47.870> take<00:02:48.350> from<00:02:48.470> the<00:02:48.650> back

00:02:48.789 --> 00:02:48.799 
inch and a half and I take from the back

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:50.320 
inch and a half and I take from the back
first<00:02:49.040> so

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:50.330 
first so

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:52.270 
first so
yeah<00:02:50.870> I<00:02:50.900> can't<00:02:51.260> really<00:02:51.290> do<00:02:51.560> that<00:02:51.590> like<00:02:51.860> usually

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280
