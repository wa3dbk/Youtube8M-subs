00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
so about a week ago I cut my hair ten

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:27.330 
so about a week ago I cut my hair ten
inches<00:02:25.840> off<00:02:26.019> I<00:02:26.170> donated<00:02:26.650> it<00:02:26.830> so<00:02:26.980> my<00:02:27.069> hair<00:02:27.220> was

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
inches off I donated it so my hair was

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:28.680 
inches off I donated it so my hair was
like<00:02:27.459> down<00:02:27.640> my<00:02:27.850> belly<00:02:28.030> button<00:02:28.330> and<00:02:28.480> now<00:02:28.540> it's

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
like down my belly button and now it's

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:33.090 
like down my belly button and now it's
like<00:02:29.310> pretty<00:02:30.310> short<00:02:30.670> well<00:02:31.390> I<00:02:31.630> guess<00:02:31.980> first<00:02:32.980> of

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100 
like pretty short well I guess first of

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:34.620 
like pretty short well I guess first of
some<00:02:33.250> people<00:02:33.549> it's<00:02:33.700> not<00:02:33.760> considered<00:02:34.360> short

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630 
some people it's not considered short

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:36.810 
some people it's not considered short
but<00:02:34.900> for<00:02:35.079> me<00:02:35.200> it<00:02:35.290> is<00:02:35.410> the<00:02:35.680> shortest<00:02:36.459> I've<00:02:36.610> been

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:36.820 
but for me it is the shortest I've been

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:38.819 
but for me it is the shortest I've been
in<00:02:37.000> like<00:02:37.150> five<00:02:37.510> years<00:02:37.540> which<00:02:38.290> is<00:02:38.410> a<00:02:38.440> long<00:02:38.769> time

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:38.829 
in like five years which is a long time

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:41.789 
in like five years which is a long time
for<00:02:39.280> me<00:02:39.370> but<00:02:40.120> I<00:02:40.299> honestly<00:02:41.019> love<00:02:41.350> it<00:02:41.500> and<00:02:41.650> this

00:02:41.789 --> 00:02:41.799 
for me but I honestly love it and this

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:43.800 
for me but I honestly love it and this
is<00:02:41.920> one<00:02:42.010> that's<00:02:42.100> natural<00:02:42.640> and<00:02:42.850> lately<00:02:43.570> I've

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:45.100 
been preferring it to be straight

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:46.229 
been preferring it to be straight
because<00:02:45.220> it<00:02:45.430> looks<00:02:45.609> really<00:02:45.820> good<00:02:45.940> but<00:02:46.209> i

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:51.110 
was so so nervous seeing that cut

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:52.930 
was so so nervous seeing that cut
because<00:04:51.470> I've<00:04:51.680> been<00:04:51.950> holding<00:04:52.370> on<00:04:52.460> to<00:04:52.610> my<00:04:52.729> long

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:52.940 
because I've been holding on to my long

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:55.420 
because I've been holding on to my long
hair<00:04:53.120> for<00:04:53.330> a<00:04:53.419> long<00:04:53.660> time<00:04:53.960> for<00:04:54.800> not<00:04:55.039> the<00:04:55.250> best

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:55.430 
hair for a long time for not the best

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:58.120 
hair for a long time for not the best
reasons<00:04:56.289> because<00:04:57.289> I<00:04:57.410> mean<00:04:57.560> everyone<00:04:57.860> had<00:04:58.039> to

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:58.130 
reasons because I mean everyone had to

00:04:58.130 --> 00:04:59.589 
reasons because I mean everyone had to
have<00:04:58.400> had<00:04:58.520> that<00:04:58.639> long<00:04:58.820> hair<00:04:58.880> and<00:04:59.210> I<00:04:59.300> was<00:04:59.419> like

00:04:59.589 --> 00:04:59.599 
have had that long hair and I was like

00:04:59.599 --> 00:05:01.750 
have had that long hair and I was like

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:01.760 
yeah I won't like hair but the reason I

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:03.969 
yeah I won't like hair but the reason I
grew<00:05:01.970> it<00:05:02.030> out<00:05:02.180> is<00:05:02.360> because<00:05:02.620> when<00:05:03.620> I<00:05:03.650> initially

00:05:03.969 --> 00:05:03.979 
grew it out is because when I initially

00:05:03.979 --> 00:05:07.570 
grew it out is because when I initially
