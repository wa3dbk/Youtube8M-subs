secondary<00:02:05.460> ability<00:02:05.850> is<00:02:06.689> not<00:02:07.439> as<00:02:07.710> great<00:02:08.009> our

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
secondary ability is not as great our

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:09.979 
secondary ability is not as great our
third<00:02:08.489> ability<00:02:08.700> I<00:02:08.940> guess<00:02:09.179> is<00:02:09.360> that<00:02:09.599> as<00:02:09.840> great

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
third ability I guess is that as great

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:11.809 
third ability I guess is that as great
as<00:02:10.110> the<00:02:10.140> other<00:02:10.379> two<00:02:10.649> being<00:02:11.459> able<00:02:11.640> to<00:02:11.700> put

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
as the other two being able to put

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:12.860 
as the other two being able to put
counters<00:02:12.209> on<00:02:12.360> everything

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
counters on everything

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:14.869 
counters on everything
and<00:02:13.049> having<00:02:13.500> haste<00:02:13.680> itself<00:02:14.069> is<00:02:14.220> going<00:02:14.730> to<00:02:14.790> be

00:02:14.869 --> 00:02:14.879 
and having haste itself is going to be

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:16.670 
and having haste itself is going to be
able<00:02:14.940> to<00:02:15.090> do<00:02:15.239> a<00:02:15.269> lot<00:02:15.569> of<00:02:15.599> damage<00:02:15.870> along<00:02:16.379> with

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
able to do a lot of damage along with

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.110 
able to do a lot of damage along with
these<00:02:16.980> gather<00:02:17.220> courage<00:02:17.459> is<00:02:17.700> I<00:02:17.790> think<00:02:18.000> that

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
these gather courage is I think that

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.699 
these gather courage is I think that
this<00:02:18.239> card<00:02:18.540> in<00:02:18.780> combination<00:02:19.560> with<00:02:19.590> the

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
this card in combination with the

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:22.250 
this card in combination with the
trampled<00:02:20.340> and<00:02:20.599> with<00:02:21.599> just<00:02:21.780> the<00:02:21.930> creatures

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
trampled and with just the creatures

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:23.180 
trampled and with just the creatures
that<00:02:22.290> are<00:02:22.409> going<00:02:22.530> to<00:02:22.620> be<00:02:22.680> hard<00:02:22.830> to<00:02:22.890> block<00:02:23.010> in

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
that are going to be hard to block in

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.250 
that are going to be hard to block in
the<00:02:23.250> early<00:02:23.430> game<00:02:23.580> make<00:02:24.209> the<00:02:24.510> the<00:02:24.810> ability<00:02:24.989> to

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
the early game make the the ability to

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.050 
the early game make the the ability to
counters<00:02:25.709> probably<00:02:26.519> just<00:02:26.670> take<00:02:26.790> over<00:02:26.970> the

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
counters probably just take over the

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.080 
counters probably just take over the
game<00:02:27.180> yeah<00:02:27.870> I<00:02:27.900> actually<00:02:28.349> think<00:02:28.709> that<00:02:29.090> this

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
game yeah I actually think that this

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:31.399 
game yeah I actually think that this
deck<00:02:30.299> has<00:02:30.450> a<00:02:30.480> lot<00:02:30.659> of<00:02:30.690> really<00:02:30.930> awesome<00:02:31.079> things

going for it such as turn to rabble

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:18.500 
the biggest of the splash like this
green<00:03:16.440> red<00:03:16.680> draw<00:03:17.040> could<00:03:17.310> could<00:03:17.819> get<00:03:18.030> very<00:03:18.239> well

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
green red draw could could get very well

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:19.970 
green red draw could could get very well
close<00:03:18.720> to<00:03:18.930> killing<00:03:19.109> someone<00:03:19.500> and<00:03:19.590> then

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
close to killing someone and then

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:21.379 
close to killing someone and then
whenever<00:03:20.130> you<00:03:20.310> dry<00:03:20.459> white<00:03:20.730> to<00:03:20.880> play<00:03:21.030> removal

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:21.389 
whenever you dry white to play removal

00:03:21.389 --> 00:03:22.909 
whenever you dry white to play removal
on<00:03:21.450> another<00:03:21.660> green<00:03:21.930> green<00:03:22.470> or<00:03:22.590> red<00:03:22.620> creature

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:22.919 
on another green green or red creature

00:03:22.919 --> 00:03:24.770 
on another green green or red creature
the<00:03:23.489> game<00:03:23.639> could<00:03:23.790> just<00:03:23.970> be<00:03:24.030> over<00:03:24.239> so<00:03:24.389> I'm

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
the game could just be over so I'm

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:26.390 
the game could just be over so I'm
really<00:03:25.169> impressed<00:03:25.319> with<00:03:25.590> the<00:03:26.130> way<00:03:26.250> it<00:03:26.370> looks

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
really impressed with the way it looks

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.129 
really impressed with the way it looks
and<00:03:26.730> I'm<00:03:26.849> hoping<00:03:27.150> it<00:03:27.450> plays<00:03:27.690> out<00:03:27.840> pretty<00:03:28.049> well

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:28.139 
and I'm hoping it plays out pretty well

00:03:28.139 --> 00:03:30.409 
and I'm hoping it plays out pretty well
too<00:03:28.379> yeah<00:03:28.680> look<00:03:28.919> I'm<00:03:29.069> a<00:03:29.099> little<00:03:29.730> skeptical<00:03:30.090> on

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:30.419 
too yeah look I'm a little skeptical on

00:03:30.419 --> 00:03:32.270 
too yeah look I'm a little skeptical on
the<00:03:30.599> evolving<00:03:31.109> wilds<00:03:31.319> but<00:03:31.680> we<00:03:31.859> only<00:03:31.980> have<00:03:32.250> one

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
the evolving wilds but we only have one

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.220 
the evolving wilds but we only have one
thing<00:03:32.549> to<00:03:32.609> do<00:03:32.760> on<00:03:32.790> turn<00:03:33.090> 1<00:03:33.299> so<00:03:33.599> it<00:03:34.019> does<00:03:34.200> make

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
thing to do on turn 1 so it does make

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:35.809 
thing to do on turn 1 so it does make
sense<00:03:34.530> for<00:03:34.680> that<00:03:34.829> regard<00:03:35.129> yeah<00:03:35.370> I<00:03:35.400> mean<00:03:35.609> it

00:03:35.809 --> 00:03:35.819 
sense for that regard yeah I mean it

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:37.580 
sense for that regard yeah I mean it
smells<00:03:36.060> also<00:03:36.419> change<00:03:36.660> the<00:03:36.720> rocks<00:03:36.989> yeah<00:03:37.349> I<00:03:37.379> mean

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
smells also change the rocks yeah I mean

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:39.379 
smells also change the rocks yeah I mean
you<00:03:37.829> you<00:03:38.099> have<00:03:38.340> to<00:03:38.370> play<00:03:38.730> at<00:03:38.910> least<00:03:39.150> nine

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:55.999 
them you have no other targets it's
really<00:04:54.509> difficult<00:04:54.690> to<00:04:54.960> bring<00:04:55.139> in<00:04:55.349> erases<00:04:55.889> and

00:04:55.999 --> 00:04:56.009 
really difficult to bring in erases and

00:04:56.009 --> 00:04:57.860 
really difficult to bring in erases and
to<00:04:56.070> start<00:04:56.250> revelries<00:04:56.699> but<00:04:57.240> if<00:04:57.389> they're<00:04:57.539> just

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:57.870 
to start revelries but if they're just

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:59.420 
to start revelries but if they're just
like<00:04:58.110> their<00:04:58.289> entire<00:04:58.500> core<00:04:58.740> strategy<00:04:59.130> is<00:04:59.190> based

00:04:59.420 --> 00:04:59.430 
like their entire core strategy is based

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:01.310 
like their entire core strategy is based
around<00:04:59.610> both<00:04:59.880> of<00:04:59.910> these<00:05:00.180> yeah<00:05:00.690> you<00:05:01.139> can<00:05:01.289> just

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:01.320 
around both of these yeah you can just

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:02.839 
around both of these yeah you can just
start<00:05:01.620> attacking<00:05:01.889> them<00:05:02.160> which<00:05:02.370> makes<00:05:02.639> it<00:05:02.759> a

00:05:02.839 --> 00:05:02.849 
start attacking them which makes it a

00:05:02.849 --> 00:05:04.640 
start attacking them which makes it a
tough<00:05:02.970> matchup<00:05:03.180> so<00:05:03.479> we<00:05:04.080> might<00:05:04.259> see<00:05:04.470> that

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:04.650 
tough matchup so we might see that

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:06.499 
tough matchup so we might see that
starting<00:05:05.039> to<00:05:05.130> happen<00:05:05.250> more<00:05:05.430> races<00:05:05.970> actually

00:05:06.499 --> 00:05:06.509 
starting to happen more races actually

00:05:06.509 --> 00:05:08.240 
starting to happen more races actually
good<00:05:06.720> or<00:05:06.960> race<00:05:07.440> effects<00:05:07.680> are<00:05:07.800> good<00:05:08.009> against

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:08.250 
good or race effects are good against

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:09.860 
good or race effects are good against
these<00:05:08.370> red<00:05:08.520> wine<00:05:08.669> decks<00:05:08.880> but<00:05:09.060> for<00:05:09.240> now<00:05:09.300> the<00:05:09.360> red

slashes<00:05:26.699> uh<00:05:27.110> it's<00:05:28.110> pretty<00:05:28.590> straightforward

00:05:28.879 --> 00:05:28.889 
slashes uh it's pretty straightforward

00:05:28.889 --> 00:05:31.339

slower<00:05:33.479> ducks<00:05:33.780> yeah<00:05:34.110> I<00:05:34.139> think<00:05:34.380> that<00:05:34.680> I<00:05:34.710> would

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:34.860 
slower ducks yeah I think that I would

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:37.430 
slower ducks yeah I think that I would
like<00:05:35.009> to<00:05:35.130> see<00:05:35.400> um<00:05:35.759> probably<00:05:36.300> a<00:05:37.020> little<00:05:37.259> bit

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:37.440 
like to see um probably a little bit

00:05:39.439 --> 00:05:39.449 
more cards that are good against a

00:05:39.449 --> 00:05:41.779 
more cards that are good against a
control<00:05:39.780> deck<00:05:39.990> something<00:05:40.500> like<00:05:40.620> sarkan<00:05:41.099> for

control deck something like sarkan for

00:05:41.789 --> 00:05:43.219 
control deck something like sarkan for
example<00:05:42.150> because<00:05:42.419> of<00:05:42.570> just<00:05:42.719> the<00:05:42.780> popularity

00:05:43.219 --> 00:05:43.229 
example because of just the popularity

00:05:43.229 --> 00:05:44.839

much more than the change of the rocks

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:06.170 
much more than the change of the rocks

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:06.180 
though because the pump spells still

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:08.240 
though because the pump spells still
killed<00:06:06.509> by<00:06:07.110> of<00:06:07.169> lights<00:06:07.530> and<00:06:07.800> things<00:06:07.979> like<00:06:08.190> that
