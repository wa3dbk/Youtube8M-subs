 if I could connect and fog 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:05.050
 and almost did not let see the cars in the beginning look with the lights 

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:08.639
 on we can get something similar because the race runs at night 

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:14.379

 that's why he went to the beginning there were no problems 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.230
 I was going to waste time at the beginning of the race with a spin with his actor 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:26.679
 Martin 

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:29.679
 which was going to recover and was going to end up winning by very little 

00:00:30.569 --> 00:00:33.690
 bertolini and micael let's go all 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.690

 tresserras of 550 maranello that we are seeing on screen that is an author 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.360
 Finally 

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:00.550
 pre-competition woolard 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:03.900
 at 24 hours of lime's age 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:06.680
 for government and for 24 also 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.490
 and it is that he does not have an engine yet 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:12.830
 of five thousand 853 cubic centimeters 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:16.030
 with an electronic activision power 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:20.350
 seven thousand laps the maximum regime rear wheel drive carbon body 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:24.340

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:32.670
 russo

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:38.899
 we say in your the headquarters in gp2 

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:41.899
 I think it was a good start for the two rep teams 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:47.190
 I had the start the fight will be as always among the big brands 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:49.060
 Cerati Aston Martin 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.940
 they came closer somehow reiterated 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:54.010
 they were not yet so pointed 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:56.000
 finally the chorus m 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.400

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:06.429
 bouquets 

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:10.340
 but they had the same rhythm as the vega guerrero with the aston martin in charge 

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:12.070
 stays 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:14.100
 one of the seven years justly 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.520
 we told them no no I did not have a good production that weekend 

00:02:18.649 --> 00:02:23.069
 and also one of the cars of the phoenix the one of maize that kept problems 

00:02:23.639 --> 00:02:25.519
 in that monza race 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:29.669
 good bamboo its more in how we told them black bouquets seconds simonsen 

00:02:29.669 --> 00:02:33.370
 petar third with aston martin was first a corvette second a maserati 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:38.140
 third an aston martin but as Pablo said to more than 52 seconds and a half of 

00:02:38.139 --> 00:02:38.950
 difference 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:41.579
 from the ring of tyrant that career 

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:43.220
 the Argentines finished 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.520
 in the thirteenth place in the general the binomial puelo mazzacane in modes 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.120
 We are talking several weeks ago 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.159
 they were tenth in their class 

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:55.720
 and nineteen in the general matías russo pérez companc finished eighth 

00:02:55.719 --> 00:02:58.430
 they added a point but they will reclassify poor's 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:03.469
 at least in gp2 that is the car of tuero imas a kane in that race of 

00:03:03.469 --> 00:03:07.540
 monza good job and if the Argentines in a circuit they knew and quite 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:08.989
 wolf for his past 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:12.349
 also in Italy when they ran in the minor categories and of course 

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:15.819
 in the national formulita the ferrari took very well 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:20.709
 she sells a problem with the engine that could also be subtracted a bit from 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:23.729
 chances but ultimately 

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:27.439
 while they were like ashton they could close a good weekend in monza 

00:03:27.439 --> 00:03:28.650
 well we know 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:33.180
