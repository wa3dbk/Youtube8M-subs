because<00:00:49.469> this<00:00:49.680> way<00:00:49.860> you're<00:00:50.100> not<00:00:50.250> cheating<00:00:50.520> in

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
because this way you're not cheating in

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.240 
because this way you're not cheating in
items<00:00:51.420> you<00:00:51.629> are<00:00:51.750> actually<00:00:52.079> using<00:00:52.770> the<00:00:52.949> items

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
items you are actually using the items

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.250 
items you are actually using the items
you<00:00:53.309> have<00:00:53.340> so<00:00:53.760> it<00:00:53.850> kind<00:00:54.059> of<00:00:54.120> sorts<00:00:54.539> them<00:00:54.780> out<00:00:54.930> in

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
you have so it kind of sorts them out in

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.350 
you have so it kind of sorts them out in
two<00:00:55.500> different<00:00:55.710> ways<00:00:56.460> and<00:00:56.760> it's<00:00:56.910> very<00:00:57.149> cool

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
two different ways and it's very cool

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.299 
two different ways and it's very cool
now<00:00:57.510> this<00:00:57.629> is<00:00:57.719> a<00:00:57.750> very<00:00:58.020> work<00:00:58.320> in<00:00:58.469> progress<00:00:58.800> mod

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
now this is a very work in progress mod

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.459 
now this is a very work in progress mod
so<00:00:59.820> there<00:01:00.059> are<00:01:00.210> things<00:01:00.449> that<00:01:00.570> don't<00:01:01.170> do

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
so there are things that don't do

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.680 
so there are things that don't do
anything<00:01:01.500> right<00:01:02.039> now<00:01:02.180> but<00:01:03.180> of<00:01:03.270> course<00:01:03.449> you<00:01:03.570> can
