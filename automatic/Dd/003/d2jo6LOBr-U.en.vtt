this<00:02:10.410> game<00:02:10.679> so<00:02:11.340> much<00:02:11.489> experience<00:02:12.269> going<00:02:12.450> crazy

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.149 

he's<00:02:15.870> got<00:02:16.049> the<00:02:16.170> meter<00:02:16.290> to<00:02:16.469> keep<00:02:16.620> this<00:02:16.769> going

00:02:17.149 --> 00:02:17.159 
he's got the meter to keep this going

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:32.509 
he's got the meter to keep this going
well<00:02:17.340> if<00:02:18.530> he<00:02:21.379> doesn't<00:02:22.379> have<00:02:22.590> enough<00:02:31.189> I<00:02:32.189> don't

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:32.519 
well if he doesn't have enough I don't
