I'm here to show you the new G 1935
skates<00:00:19.949> that<00:00:20.279> were<00:00:20.430> bringing<00:00:20.789> out<00:00:20.939> this<00:00:21.210> year

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:21.590 
skates that were bringing out this year

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:25.670 
skates that were bringing out this year
we<00:00:22.590> have<00:00:22.710> developed<00:00:23.279> a<00:00:23.519> way<00:00:23.699> to<00:00:24.150> use<00:00:25.109> real

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
we have developed a way to use real

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.670 
we have developed a way to use real
carbon<00:00:26.310> fiber<00:00:26.609> weave<00:00:27.180> in<00:00:27.990> a<00:00:28.320> skate

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
carbon fiber weave in a skate

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.590 
carbon fiber weave in a skate
application<00:00:29.689> we<00:00:30.689> have<00:00:30.810> layered<00:00:31.080> I<00:00:31.800> Nomar

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:32.600 
application we have layered I Nomar

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:35.780 
application we have layered I Nomar
layers<00:00:33.600> on<00:00:34.170> both<00:00:34.530> sides<00:00:34.860> of<00:00:35.070> the<00:00:35.160> carbon<00:00:35.520> fiber

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
layers on both sides of the carbon fiber

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.310 
layers on both sides of the carbon fiber
so<00:00:36.690> it<00:00:36.780> has<00:00:36.899> the<00:00:37.110> light<00:00:37.320> weight<00:00:37.590> and<00:00:37.920> strength

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:39.320 
so it has the light weight and strength

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.940 
so it has the light weight and strength
qualities<00:00:40.320> of<00:00:40.620> carbon<00:00:41.010> fiber<00:00:41.360> but<00:00:42.530> it<00:00:43.530> still

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
qualities of carbon fiber but it still

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.380 
qualities of carbon fiber but it still
has<00:00:44.190> a<00:00:44.219> flexible<00:00:46.280> quality<00:00:47.280> that<00:00:47.550> can<00:00:47.789> be<00:00:47.969> used

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
has a flexible quality that can be used

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.680 
has a flexible quality that can be used
in<00:00:48.600> a<00:00:48.690> skating<00:00:48.989> application<00:00:50.120> so<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.329> carbon

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
in a skating application so the carbon

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:57.979 
in a skating application so the carbon
fiber<00:00:51.989> quarter<00:00:52.770> panels<00:00:54.980> are<00:00:56.510> are<00:00:57.510> sewn

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
fiber quarter panels are are sewn

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:03.700 
fiber quarter panels are are sewn
together<00:00:59.239> to<00:01:00.239> create<00:01:00.660> a<00:01:00.930> 3d<00:01:01.739> heel<00:01:02.070> shape<00:01:02.690> we've

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:03.710 
together to create a 3d heel shape we've

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:08.330 
together to create a 3d heel shape we've
brought<00:01:04.710> a<00:01:04.739> new<00:01:05.010> liner<00:01:05.339> this<00:01:05.729> year<00:01:06.180> it's<00:01:07.080> a<00:01:07.409> 3d

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
brought a new liner this year it's a 3d

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.870 
brought a new liner this year it's a 3d
molded<00:01:08.760> liner<00:01:09.920> the<00:01:10.920> padding<00:01:11.400> and<00:01:11.520> the<00:01:11.640> liner

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
molded liner the padding and the liner

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.359 
molded liner the padding and the liner
is<00:01:12.210> all<00:01:12.420> one<00:01:12.689> piece<00:01:13.020> it<00:01:13.439> doesn't<00:01:13.860> absorb<00:01:13.979> any

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
is all one piece it doesn't absorb any

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.780 
is all one piece it doesn't absorb any
moisture<00:01:15.470> so<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:16.770> skate<00:01:17.250> doesn't<00:01:17.670> get

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
moisture so the skate doesn't get

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.760 
moisture so the skate doesn't get
heavier<00:01:18.150> when<00:01:18.450> you<00:01:18.570> sweat<00:01:18.960> in<00:01:19.140> it<00:01:19.340> and<00:01:21.560> we<00:01:22.560> have

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
heavier when you sweat in it and we have

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.030 
heavier when you sweat in it and we have
the<00:01:23.040> Ultra<00:01:23.970> 5000<00:01:24.689> holder<00:01:25.080> on<00:01:25.259> it<00:01:25.470> the<00:01:25.680> lightest

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
the Ultra 5000 holder on it the lightest

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.240 
the Ultra 5000 holder on it the lightest

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
very heat moldable quarter panels you

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.180 
very heat moldable quarter panels you
have<00:02:12.970> your<00:02:13.209> footbed<00:02:13.660> so<00:02:14.500> the<00:02:14.650> bottom<00:02:15.010> here

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
have your footbed so the bottom here

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:18.449 
have your footbed so the bottom here
foot<00:02:15.459> the<00:02:15.670> sides<00:02:15.970> of<00:02:16.270> your<00:02:16.300> feet<00:02:16.690> your<00:02:17.650> your

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:18.459 
foot the sides of your feet your your

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:20.670 
foot the sides of your feet your your
Achilles<00:02:18.970> is<00:02:19.300> locked<00:02:19.600> in<00:02:19.870> you<00:02:20.110> have<00:02:20.260> a<00:02:20.290> heel

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
Achilles is locked in you have a heel

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.340 
Achilles is locked in you have a heel
pocket<00:02:21.010> so<00:02:22.000> your<00:02:22.180> foot<00:02:22.450> isn't<00:02:22.630> slipping

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:23.350 
pocket so your foot isn't slipping

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:26.070 
pocket so your foot isn't slipping
inside<00:02:23.500> the<00:02:23.920> skate<00:02:24.300> when<00:02:25.300> your<00:02:25.420> foot<00:02:25.720> slips

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 
inside the skate when your foot slips

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.530 
inside the skate when your foot slips
inside<00:02:26.350> the<00:02:26.739> skate<00:02:27.040> you<00:02:27.459> lose<00:02:27.730> power

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
inside the skate you lose power

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.770 
inside the skate you lose power
so<00:02:28.989> this<00:02:29.680> locks<00:02:30.070> your<00:02:30.400> foot<00:02:30.640> in<00:02:30.820> so<00:02:31.330> note

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
so this locks your foot in so note

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:33.660 
so this locks your foot in so note
there's<00:02:31.989> no<00:02:32.200> power<00:02:32.470> loss<00:02:32.770> in<00:02:33.160> your<00:02:33.190> skating

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
there's no power loss in your skating

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:37.440 
there's no power loss in your skating
stride<00:02:34.120> and<00:02:34.480> then<00:02:35.320> finally<00:02:35.920> the<00:02:36.790> tongue<00:02:37.090> is

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
stride and then finally the tongue is

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.420 
stride and then finally the tongue is
heat<00:02:37.810> moldable<00:02:38.230> to<00:02:38.530> the<00:02:38.650> top<00:02:38.890> of<00:02:39.070> your<00:02:39.130> foot
