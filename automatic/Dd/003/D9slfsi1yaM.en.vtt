00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
texture and you get a lot of grip on it

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.530 
texture and you get a lot of grip on it
and<00:02:25.950> it's<00:02:26.310> really<00:02:26.520> nice<00:02:26.910> it<00:02:27.180> doesn't<00:02:27.450> look

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
and it's really nice it doesn't look

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:28.850 
and it's really nice it doesn't look
like<00:02:27.570> it<00:02:27.780> has<00:02:27.810> a<00:02:27.900> nice<00:02:28.110> swell<00:02:28.410> but<00:02:28.620> when<00:02:28.740> you're

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
like it has a nice swell but when you're

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.950 
like it has a nice swell but when you're
holding<00:02:28.980> it<00:02:29.250> it<00:02:29.880> just<00:02:30.030> feels<00:02:30.270> like<00:02:30.450> there's

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:30.960 
holding it it just feels like there's

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.350

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.440 
plenty the overall length on this knife
is<00:02:33.630> seven<00:02:34.350> and<00:02:34.560> three<00:02:34.830> eighths<00:02:35.120> so<00:02:36.120> it's<00:02:36.240> not<00:02:36.420> a

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
is seven and three eighths so it's not a

lock just pretty much just a frame lock
as<00:04:39.169> you<00:04:39.260> can<00:04:39.410> see<00:04:39.620> so<00:04:40.040> thick<00:04:40.430> and<00:04:40.700> it's<00:04:40.910> just

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:41.060 
as you can see so thick and it's just

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:43.740 
as you can see so thick and it's just
got<00:04:41.150> a<00:04:41.180> g10<00:04:41.600> over<00:04:41.840> it

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:43.750 
got a g10 over it

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:48.030 
got a g10 over it
as<00:04:44.750> you<00:04:44.930> can<00:04:45.020> see<00:04:45.260> kind<00:04:45.530> of<00:04:45.620> in<00:04:45.770> there<00:04:46.090> they<00:04:47.090> are

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:48.040 
as you can see kind of in there they are

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:51.490 
as you can see kind of in there they are
drilled<00:04:49.040> out<00:04:49.450> to<00:04:50.450> reduce<00:04:50.870> weight<00:04:51.110> but<00:04:51.350> it's

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:51.500 
drilled out to reduce weight but it's

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:53.110 
drilled out to reduce weight but it's
just<00:04:51.710> steel<00:04:52.070> if<00:04:52.490> they<00:04:52.700> would<00:04:52.850> have<00:04:52.940> gone<00:04:53.060> with

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:53.120 
just steel if they would have gone with

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:54.850 
just steel if they would have gone with
titanium<00:04:53.690> on<00:04:53.990> this<00:04:54.169> night<00:04:54.350> that<00:04:54.590> would<00:04:54.740> have

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:54.860 
titanium on this night that would have

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:58.540 
titanium on this night that would have
been<00:04:55.070> amazingly<00:04:55.639> perfect<00:04:57.160> but<00:04:58.160> they<00:04:58.250> didn't

00:04:58.540 --> 00:04:58.550 
been amazingly perfect but they didn't

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:00.370 
been amazingly perfect but they didn't
they<00:04:58.610> went<00:04:58.970> with<00:04:59.060> a<00:04:59.090> steel<00:04:59.389> but<00:04:59.900> that's<00:05:00.050> okay

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:00.380 
they went with a steel but that's okay

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:01.840 
they went with a steel but that's okay
stainless<00:05:00.919> steel<00:05:01.100> inner<00:05:01.370> so<00:05:01.520> it'll<00:05:01.669> still

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:01.850 
stainless steel inner so it'll still

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:04.060 
stainless steel inner so it'll still
work<00:05:01.880> it's<00:05:02.240> such<00:05:02.419> a<00:05:02.450> hefty<00:05:02.840> blade<00:05:03.050> and<00:05:03.200> it<00:05:03.350> just

famous<00:06:12.319> knife<00:06:12.529> here<00:06:13.089> is<00:06:14.499> I<00:06:15.789> don't<00:06:16.789> get<00:06:17.029> blurry

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:17.270 
famous knife here is I don't get blurry

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:20.439 
famous knife here is I don't get blurry
because<00:06:17.419> I'm<00:06:17.749> on<00:06:17.869> macro<00:06:18.319> but<00:06:19.180> so<00:06:20.180> you<00:06:20.270> can<00:06:20.360> get

00:06:20.439 --> 00:06:20.449 
because I'm on macro but so you can get

00:06:20.449 --> 00:06:23.739 
because I'm on macro but so you can get
the<00:06:20.539> whole<00:06:20.629> blade<00:06:20.869> in<00:06:21.849> there's<00:06:22.849> that<00:06:23.089> and<00:06:23.419> then

00:06:23.739 --> 00:06:23.749 
the whole blade in there's that and then

00:06:23.749 --> 00:06:25.719 
the whole blade in there's that and then
there's<00:06:23.779> a<00:06:24.139> tenacious<00:06:24.710> so<00:06:25.129> the<00:06:25.249> teenies<00:06:25.520> just

00:06:25.719 --> 00:06:25.729 
there's a tenacious so the teenies just

00:06:25.729 --> 00:06:33.070 
there's a tenacious so the teenies just
is<00:06:25.849> much<00:06:26.119> bigger<00:06:31.149> will<00:06:32.149> line<00:06:32.360> up<00:06:32.389> the<00:06:32.719> blades

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:33.080 
is much bigger will line up the blades

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:37.540 
is much bigger will line up the blades
actually<00:06:34.719> so<00:06:35.719> I<00:06:36.110> mean<00:06:36.259> it<00:06:36.379> measures<00:06:37.189> up<00:06:37.339> to<00:06:37.369> the

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:37.550 
actually so I mean it measures up to the

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:38.829 
actually so I mean it measures up to the
net<00:06:37.849> tenacious<00:06:38.330> if<00:06:38.449> you<00:06:38.509> look<00:06:38.659> where<00:06:38.809> the

00:06:38.829 --> 00:06:38.839 
net tenacious if you look where the

00:06:38.839 --> 00:06:45.730 
net tenacious if you look where the
blade<00:06:39.499> lengths<00:06:39.860> are<00:06:40.689> it's<00:06:41.689> not<00:06:41.779> too<00:06:41.990> bad<00:06:44.740> stage
