00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
seven of their last eight away games

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.209 
seven of their last eight away games
have<00:01:57.540> finished<00:01:57.719> under<00:01:58.049> 2.5<00:01:58.560> goals<00:01:58.950> I<00:01:59.189> don't

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
have finished under 2.5 goals I don't

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:00.770 
have finished under 2.5 goals I don't
think<00:01:59.670> they're<00:01:59.850> really<00:02:00.030> going<00:02:00.299> to<00:02:00.390> push<00:02:00.570> on

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
think they're really going to push on

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.810 
think they're really going to push on
and<00:02:00.960> get<00:02:01.110> much<00:02:01.619> of<00:02:01.649> a<00:02:01.799> result<00:02:02.159> here<00:02:02.340> they

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
and get much of a result here they

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.249 
and get much of a result here they
couldn't<00:02:03.090> be<00:02:03.270> worse<00:02:03.509> problem<00:02:03.899> in<00:02:03.990> fact<00:02:04.079> they

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
couldn't be worse problem in fact they

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.709 
couldn't be worse problem in fact they
were<00:02:04.320> quite<00:02:04.860> by<00:02:05.790> quite<00:02:05.969> a<00:02:06.000> distance<00:02:06.240> the<00:02:06.540> worst

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
were quite by quite a distance the worst

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.479 
were quite by quite a distance the worst
side<00:02:06.990> in<00:02:07.170> that<00:02:07.320> match<00:02:07.500> so<00:02:08.039> I<00:02:08.069> don't<00:02:08.310> think

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
side in that match so I don't think

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:09.499 
side in that match so I don't think
they're<00:02:08.580> going<00:02:08.700> to<00:02:08.819> be<00:02:08.910> able<00:02:08.970> to<00:02:09.119> step<00:02:09.300> it<00:02:09.420> up

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
they're going to be able to step it up

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.029 
they're going to be able to step it up
and<00:02:09.750> provide<00:02:09.959> anything<00:02:10.349> different<00:02:10.770> against

direction of Manchester 19 minus 1.5

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:27.540 
direction of Manchester 19 minus 1.5
which<00:02:26.110> is<00:02:26.230> a<00:02:26.260> pretty<00:02:26.470> good<00:02:26.740> odds<00:02:26.860> it's<00:02:27.070> a<00:02:27.280> two

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 
which is a pretty good odds it's a two

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:30.120 
which is a pretty good odds it's a two
point<00:02:27.820> zero<00:02:27.880> four<00:02:28.420> with<00:02:28.570> SB<00:02:28.900> over<00:02:29.230> I've<00:02:29.890> have

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 
point zero four with SB over I've have

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:31.620 
point zero four with SB over I've have
been<00:02:30.310> having<00:02:30.490> to<00:02:30.580> look<00:02:30.670> myself<00:02:30.880> as<00:02:31.270> well<00:02:31.420> and<00:02:31.600> I

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
been having to look myself as well and I

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:33.180 
been having to look myself as well and I
had<00:02:31.720> a<00:02:31.750> look<00:02:31.930> at<00:02:32.050> the<00:02:32.140> end<00:02:32.260> of<00:02:32.320> 2.5<00:02:32.890> girls

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
had a look at the end of 2.5 girls

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:34.890 
had a look at the end of 2.5 girls
because<00:02:34.000> basically<00:02:34.240> what<00:02:34.570> i<00:02:34.600> said<00:02:34.870> earlier

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
because basically what i said earlier

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.230 
because basically what i said earlier
the<00:02:35.380> fact<00:02:35.890> that<00:02:35.920> Stoke<00:02:36.190> I'm<00:02:36.670> really<00:02:36.880> scoring

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:37.240 
the fact that Stoke I'm really scoring

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:38.880 
the fact that Stoke I'm really scoring
and<00:02:37.510> they're<00:02:37.630> not<00:02:37.750> conceding<00:02:38.290> that<00:02:38.320> many<00:02:38.650> Iver

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
and they're not conceding that many Iver

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:41.970 
and they're not conceding that many Iver
so<00:02:39.790> I<00:02:40.330> had<00:02:40.480> to<00:02:40.510> look<00:02:40.690> for<00:02:40.870> under<00:02:41.110> 2.5<00:02:41.590> girls

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
so I had to look for under 2.5 girls

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:43.980 
so I had to look for under 2.5 girls
that<00:02:42.400> looks<00:02:42.550> pretty<00:02:42.670> good<00:02:42.820> that's<00:02:43.120> 2.1<00:02:43.810> with

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:43.990 
that looks pretty good that's 2.1 with

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:45.600 
that looks pretty good that's 2.1 with
ladbrokes<00:02:44.440> and<00:02:44.620> Paddy<00:02:44.830> Power<00:02:45.070> at<00:02:45.220> the<00:02:45.280> moment
