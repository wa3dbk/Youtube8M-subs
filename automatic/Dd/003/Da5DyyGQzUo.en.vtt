00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
over a few parts of the shoe you can see

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.120 
over a few parts of the shoe you can see
in<00:02:06.900> the<00:02:06.990> midsole<00:02:07.320> there's<00:02:07.530> little<00:02:07.770> grooves

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.130 
in the midsole there's little grooves

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:11.180 
in the midsole there's little grooves
here<00:02:08.429> and<00:02:09.390> that<00:02:09.660> is<00:02:09.929> crucial<00:02:10.320> on<00:02:10.500> fun<00:02:10.830> and

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
here and that is crucial on fun and

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:14.810 
here and that is crucial on fun and
pretty<00:02:11.760> much<00:02:11.970> as<00:02:12.750> you<00:02:13.050> walk<00:02:13.380> these<00:02:13.950> spread<00:02:14.640> out

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:14.820 
pretty much as you walk these spread out

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:18.140 
pretty much as you walk these spread out
and<00:02:15.090> compress<00:02:16.520> basically<00:02:17.520> making<00:02:17.910> the

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
and compress basically making the

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:22.040 
and compress basically making the
transition<00:02:18.540> from<00:02:19.020> heel<00:02:19.560> to<00:02:19.590> toe<00:02:20.209> seamless<00:02:21.209> as

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
transition from heel to toe seamless as

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:23.660 
transition from heel to toe seamless as
well<00:02:22.290> as<00:02:22.410> providing<00:02:22.740> some<00:02:23.040> cushioning<00:02:23.490> and

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
well as providing some cushioning and

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.120 
well as providing some cushioning and
then<00:02:24.300> in<00:02:24.540> the<00:02:24.660> heel<00:02:24.930> is<00:02:25.200> another<00:02:25.470> zoom<00:02:25.830> unit

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
then in the heel is another zoom unit

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:27.949 
then in the heel is another zoom unit
providing<00:02:26.550> more<00:02:26.760> cushioning<00:02:27.209> the<00:02:27.600> outsole

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
providing more cushioning the outsole

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:30.860 
providing more cushioning the outsole
has<00:02:28.230> a<00:02:28.620> ton<00:02:28.950> of<00:02:28.980> traction<00:02:29.700> on<00:02:29.820> it<00:02:29.850> as<00:02:30.630> you<00:02:30.750> can

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
has a ton of traction on it as you can

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.490 
has a ton of traction on it as you can

the heel the tongue right here is a

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.040 
the heel the tongue right here is a
sweep<00:02:41.070> and<00:02:41.280> to<00:02:41.400> connect<00:02:41.640> it<00:02:41.730> to<00:02:41.850> the<00:02:41.940> shoe<00:02:42.180> and

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
it goes all the way down to pretty much

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.330 
it goes all the way down to pretty much
the<00:02:44.970> lacing<00:02:45.330> systems<00:02:45.750> made<00:02:46.500> out<00:02:46.620> of<00:02:46.739> mesh<00:02:46.980> and

it's<00:02:47.670> for<00:02:47.910> breathability<00:02:48.360> and<00:02:49.010> pretty<00:02:50.010> much

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
it's for breathability and pretty much

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:52.330 
it's for breathability and pretty much
