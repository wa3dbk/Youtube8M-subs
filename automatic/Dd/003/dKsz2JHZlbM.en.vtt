we've<00:00:01.709> been<00:00:01.860> working<00:00:02.070> on<00:00:02.310> their<00:00:02.429> coaster<00:00:02.820> for

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:03.000 
we've been working on their coaster for

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.999 
we've been working on their coaster for
about<00:00:03.179> three<00:00:03.419> weeks<00:00:03.449> now<00:00:03.780> and<00:00:04.110> judgement<00:00:04.830> day

00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:05.009 
about three weeks now and judgement day

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:07.610 
about three weeks now and judgement day
or<00:00:05.430> the<00:00:05.910> day<00:00:05.940> they'll<00:00:06.359> be<00:00:06.420> graded<00:00:06.960> has<00:00:07.230> finally

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
or the day they'll be graded has finally

or the day they'll be graded has finally
come<00:00:07.830> well<00:00:08.900> so<00:00:09.900> much<00:00:10.110> concerned<00:00:10.500> with<00:00:10.620> the<00:00:10.710> lap

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
come well so much concerned with the lap

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:12.530 
come well so much concerned with the lap
record<00:00:11.130> just<00:00:11.580> because<00:00:11.910> of<00:00:12.059> the<00:00:12.090> fact<00:00:12.389> that

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
record just because of the fact that

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.240 
record just because of the fact that
we've<00:00:12.929> already<00:00:13.080> broken<00:00:13.320> two<00:00:13.679> others<00:00:13.980> we've

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
we've already broken two others we've

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.099 
we've already broken two others we've
broken<00:00:14.490> the<00:00:14.670> height<00:00:14.849> record<00:00:15.240> and<00:00:15.540> you<00:00:15.839> put<00:00:16.020> in

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
broken the height record and you put in

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.529 
broken the height record and you put in
the<00:00:16.199> second<00:00:16.529> loop<00:00:16.680> their<00:00:17.670> coaster<00:00:18.060> comes<00:00:18.330> in

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
the second loop their coaster comes in

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.390 
the second loop their coaster comes in
at<00:00:18.630> a<00:00:18.690> whopping<00:00:18.720> six<00:00:19.350> to<00:00:19.560> ten<00:00:19.890> and<00:00:19.920> one-half

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
so heavy that he's make another link out

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.530 
so heavy that he's make another link out
it'll<00:00:33.840> just<00:00:34.020> pull<00:00:34.260> it<00:00:34.410> in<00:00:34.559> the<00:00:34.860> sound<00:00:35.360> but<00:00:36.360> when

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
it'll just pull it in the sound but when

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.420 
it'll just pull it in the sound but when
things<00:00:36.690> suddenly<00:00:36.930> start<00:00:37.350> going<00:00:37.590> bad<00:00:37.800> on<00:00:37.829> the

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
things suddenly start going bad on the

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.729 
things suddenly start going bad on the
Ripper<00:00:38.700> their<00:00:39.420> goals<00:00:39.719> of<00:00:39.899> breaking<00:00:40.290> records

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
Ripper their goals of breaking records

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:59.970 
Ripper their goals of breaking records
seem<00:00:41.399> to<00:00:41.520> be<00:00:41.640> breaking<00:00:42.059> apart

00:00:59.970 --> 00:00:59.980 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:07.300 

Oh

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:07.310 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:09.429 

at<00:01:07.850> one<00:01:08.090> point<00:01:08.119> it<00:01:08.479> may<00:01:08.630> have<00:01:08.780> seemed<00:01:08.990> like<00:01:09.200> all

00:01:09.429 --> 00:01:09.439 
at one point it may have seemed like all

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:11.230 
at one point it may have seemed like all
was<00:01:09.590> lost<00:01:09.799> but<00:01:10.430> this<00:01:10.610> group<00:01:10.759> pulled<00:01:11.119> it

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:11.240 
was lost but this group pulled it

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.030 
was lost but this group pulled it
together<00:01:11.390> and<00:01:11.810> broke<00:01:12.259> two<00:01:12.290> of<00:01:12.530> the<00:01:12.740> three

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:13.040 
together and broke two of the three

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.749 
together and broke two of the three
school<00:01:13.340> records<00:01:13.850> I<00:01:14.530> think<00:01:15.530> the<00:01:15.799> success<00:01:16.220> just

00:01:16.749 --> 00:01:16.759 
school records I think the success just

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:18.700 
school records I think the success just
because<00:01:17.000> of<00:01:17.119> the<00:01:17.149> fact<00:01:17.360> that<00:01:17.509> we<00:01:18.500> actually

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:18.710 
because of the fact that we actually

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:20.859 
because of the fact that we actually
accomplish<00:01:19.520> what<00:01:19.700> we<00:01:19.729> came<00:01:19.880> to<00:01:20.060> accomplish<00:01:20.689> we

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:20.869 
accomplish what we came to accomplish we

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:22.569 
accomplish what we came to accomplish we
got<00:01:21.079> the<00:01:21.229> double<00:01:21.470> loop<00:01:21.649> and<00:01:21.890> we<00:01:22.009> got<00:01:22.159> an<00:01:22.310> extra

00:01:22.569 --> 00:01:22.579 
got the double loop and we got an extra

00:01:22.579 --> 00:01:24.399 
got the double loop and we got an extra
height<00:01:22.729> it<00:01:22.909> functions<00:01:23.450> for<00:01:23.960> a<00:01:23.990> little<00:01:24.200> while

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:24.409 
height it functions for a little while

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:27.429 
height it functions for a little while
but<00:01:25.280> I<00:01:25.580> think<00:01:26.030> it's<00:01:26.149> a<00:01:26.210> success<00:01:26.600> I<00:01:26.869> didn't

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:27.439 
but I think it's a success I didn't

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:30.340 
but I think it's a success I didn't
really<00:01:27.830> well<00:01:28.189> from<00:01:28.909> misty<00:01:29.450> at<00:01:29.810> the<00:01:30.020> beginning

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:30.350 
really well from misty at the beginning

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:31.660 
really well from misty at the beginning
when<00:01:30.470> we<00:01:30.500> started<00:01:30.590> the<00:01:30.920> roller<00:01:31.070> coaster<00:01:31.460> she

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:31.670 
when we started the roller coaster she

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:33.340 
when we started the roller coaster she
poses<00:01:32.060> with<00:01:32.390> the<00:01:32.479> challenge<00:01:32.869> of<00:01:32.960> putting<00:01:33.140> in

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.350 
poses with the challenge of putting in

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:35.139 
poses with the challenge of putting in
two<00:01:33.590> loops<00:01:33.829> and<00:01:34.189> we<00:01:34.429> said<00:01:34.670> that<00:01:34.820> no<00:01:35.000> matter

00:01:35.139 --> 00:01:35.149 
two loops and we said that no matter

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:37.889 
two loops and we said that no matter
what<00:01:35.390> that's<00:01:35.659> what<00:01:35.869> we<00:01:35.990> do<00:01:36.170> and<00:01:36.470> we<00:01:37.009> did<00:01:37.159> it<00:01:37.310> I

00:01:37.889 --> 00:01:37.899 
what that's what we do and we did it I

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:40.570 
what that's what we do and we did it I
think<00:01:38.899> we<00:01:39.020> met<00:01:39.229> our<00:01:39.380> goal<00:01:39.409> and<00:01:39.770> we<00:01:40.250> exceeded

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:40.580 
think we met our goal and we exceeded

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:42.399 
think we met our goal and we exceeded
the<00:01:40.700> expectations<00:01:40.940> of<00:01:41.360> our<00:01:41.509> teachers<00:01:41.840> and<00:01:42.080> all

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:42.409 
the expectations of our teachers and all

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:43.870 
the expectations of our teachers and all
of<00:01:42.530> our<00:01:42.619> peers<00:01:42.920> and<00:01:43.130> that's<00:01:43.610> what<00:01:43.729> we<00:01:43.819> were

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880 
of our peers and that's what we were

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:45.699 
of our peers and that's what we were
going<00:01:44.030> for<00:01:44.119> and<00:01:44.450> we<00:01:44.630> whiled<00:01:44.899> everybody<00:01:45.319> by<00:01:45.560> how

00:01:45.699 --> 00:01:45.709 
going for and we whiled everybody by how

00:01:45.709 --> 00:01:47.469 
going for and we whiled everybody by how
tall<00:01:45.920> it<00:01:46.069> was<00:01:46.100> that's<00:01:47.030> what<00:01:47.119> we're<00:01:47.240> going<00:01:47.390> for

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:47.479 
tall it was that's what we're going for

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:49.719 
tall it was that's what we're going for
some<00:01:48.229> of<00:01:48.350> these<00:01:48.470> students<00:01:49.130> are<00:01:49.280> thinking

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:49.729 
some of these students are thinking

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:53.469 
some of these students are thinking
about<00:01:49.850> careers<00:01:50.390> in<00:01:50.479> engineering<00:01:50.810> and<00:01:51.580> a<00:01:52.580> lot

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:53.479 
about careers in engineering and a lot

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:54.580 
about careers in engineering and a lot
of<00:01:53.509> times<00:01:53.780> when<00:01:53.929> people<00:01:53.990> think<00:01:54.470> about

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 
of times when people think about

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:56.499 
of times when people think about
engineering<00:01:55.250> they<00:01:55.580> think<00:01:55.819> maybe<00:01:56.030> just<00:01:56.299> about

00:01:56.499 --> 00:01:56.509 
engineering they think maybe just about

00:01:56.509 --> 00:01:59.050 
engineering they think maybe just about
building<00:01:56.869> roads<00:01:57.380> or<00:01:57.649> building<00:01:58.039> bridges<00:01:58.640> and

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
building roads or building bridges and

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:00.999 
building roads or building bridges and
things<00:01:59.270> like<00:01:59.420> that<00:01:59.479> but<00:01:59.799> engineering<00:02:00.799> is<00:02:00.979> a

00:02:00.999 --> 00:02:01.009 
things like that but engineering is a

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:03.309 
things like that but engineering is a
really<00:02:01.580> wide<00:02:01.819> open<00:02:02.179> field<00:02:02.450> and<00:02:02.780> there<00:02:03.170> are

00:02:03.309 --> 00:02:03.319 
really wide open field and there are

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:06.070 
really wide open field and there are
engineers<00:02:04.009> that<00:02:04.310> make<00:02:05.149> designs<00:02:05.599> for<00:02:05.899> roller

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:06.080 
engineers that make designs for roller
