00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
don't make hubs for thunderbolt at this

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.150 
don't make hubs for thunderbolt at this

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
the HDMI cable straight away so let's

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.179 
the HDMI cable straight away so let's
see<00:01:05.970> if<00:01:06.030> we<00:01:06.150> can<00:01:06.299> be<00:01:06.450> as<00:01:06.630> lucky<00:01:06.900> when<00:01:07.799> we<00:01:07.950> take

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
see if we can be as lucky when we take

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.399 
see if we can be as lucky when we take
the<00:01:08.369> HDMI<00:01:08.939> cable<00:01:08.970> out<00:01:09.510> of<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:09.780> television<00:01:10.080> and

the HDMI cable out of the television and
put<00:01:10.950> it<00:01:11.040> into<00:01:11.280> our<00:01:11.310> black<00:01:11.670> magic<00:01:12.119> card<00:01:12.390> okay

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
this black magic is it's got a piece of

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.520 
this black magic is it's got a piece of
software<00:01:28.380> that<00:01:28.530> allows<00:01:28.740> you<00:01:29.009> to<00:01:29.930> capture<00:01:30.930> the

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
software that allows you to capture the

software that allows you to capture the
the<00:01:31.829> video<00:01:32.100> signals<00:01:32.670> but<00:01:33.479> you've<00:01:33.630> actually

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
the video signals but you've actually

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.080 
the video signals but you've actually
got<00:01:34.200> to<00:01:34.229> go<00:01:34.409> into<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:34.799> system<00:01:35.040> preferences<00:01:35.850> as

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
got to go into the system preferences as

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:42.380 
got to go into the system preferences as
well<00:01:36.740> to<00:01:37.740> change<00:01:38.659> the<00:01:39.659> Blackmagic<00:01:40.490> inputs<00:01:41.490> so

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390

at the moment we've said that we've got
the<00:01:44.280> HDMI<00:01:45.210> coming<00:01:46.049> in<00:01:46.229> so<00:01:46.649> we'll<00:01:46.799> call<00:01:47.009> it<00:01:47.159> HDMI

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:30.240 
there that's annoying as you could see

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:33.080 
there that's annoying as you could see
before<00:02:30.450> the<00:02:30.900> television<00:02:31.200> picked<00:02:31.710> up<00:02:31.860> that<00:02:32.090> so

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
before the television picked up that so

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:38.690 
before the television picked up that so
we've<00:02:33.510> got<00:02:33.690> the<00:02:33.810> s-video<00:02:35.630> coming<00:02:36.630> out<00:02:37.700> and

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
we've got the s-video coming out and

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.990 
we've got the s-video coming out and
into<00:02:39.450> the<00:02:39.480> television<00:02:40.400> so<00:02:41.400> let's<00:02:41.580> try<00:02:41.820> that

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
into the television so let's try that

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.310 
into the television so let's try that
same<00:02:42.270> signal<00:02:43.280> with<00:02:44.280> the<00:02:44.400> back<00:02:44.610> Magic<00:02:45.170> pull<00:02:46.170> out

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:46.320 
same signal with the back Magic pull out

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:51.320 
same signal with the back Magic pull out
the<00:02:47.480> HDMI<00:02:48.480> and<00:02:48.750> we<00:02:49.470> look<00:02:49.620> for<00:02:49.800> s-video<00:02:50.130> in<00:02:50.550> and

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
the HDMI and we look for s-video in and

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:55.610 
the HDMI and we look for s-video in and
we'll<00:02:51.450> put<00:02:51.480> the<00:02:51.750> s-video<00:02:52.140> in<00:02:53.750> like<00:02:54.750> that<00:02:55.020> like

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
we'll put the s-video in like that like

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:04.990 
we'll put the s-video in like that like
so<00:02:55.920> and<00:02:58.100> let's<00:02:59.100> see<00:02:59.550> what<00:03:00.180> we<00:03:00.360> can<00:03:00.600> get<00:03:00.950> on

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.030 

black<00:03:06.000> magic<00:03:06.510> with<00:03:06.690> the<00:03:06.810> s-video<00:03:07.170> log<00:03:07.830> and

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
black magic with the s-video log and

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.190 
black magic with the s-video log and
capture<00:03:08.220> go<00:03:08.880> into<00:03:09.120> the<00:03:09.800> system<00:03:10.800> preferences

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
capture go into the system preferences

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.730 
capture go into the system preferences
this<00:03:13.200> is<00:03:13.350> annoying<00:03:14.480> and<00:03:15.480> we<00:03:16.080> put<00:03:16.290> on<00:03:16.440> the

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:16.740 
this is annoying and we put on the

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:21.020 
this is annoying and we put on the
s-video<00:03:17.580> and<00:03:18.320> we'll<00:03:19.320> change<00:03:19.620> it<00:03:19.830> to<00:03:20.070> let's

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
s-video and we'll change it to let's

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.390 
s-video and we'll change it to let's
start<00:03:21.330> with<00:03:21.510> power<00:03:21.780> again<00:03:22.170> s-video<00:03:22.770> and<00:03:23.190> tau

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
start with power again s-video and tau

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.910 
start with power again s-video and tau
and<00:03:24.360> then<00:03:24.540> we'll<00:03:24.750> go<00:03:24.930> to<00:03:24.960> the<00:03:25.170> media<00:03:25.470> Express

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
and then we'll go to the media Express

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.910 
and then we'll go to the media Express
preferences<00:03:26.900> we'll<00:03:27.900> change<00:03:28.200> that<00:03:28.320> to<00:03:28.500> power

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
preferences we'll change that to power

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:32.000 
preferences we'll change that to power
so<00:03:29.760> that<00:03:29.790> all<00:03:30.270> matches<00:03:30.720> up<00:03:30.750> and<00:03:31.590> let's<00:03:31.830> see

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
so that all matches up and let's see

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:32.690 
so that all matches up and let's see
what<00:03:32.190> we<00:03:32.310> get

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700 
what we get

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:38.750 
what we get
alright<00:03:33.690> so<00:03:34.640> we<00:03:35.640> can<00:03:35.850> see<00:03:36.210> its<00:03:36.660> video<00:03:37.730> when<00:03:38.730> I

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760

I'll be able to use it like a second
monitor<00:03:45.290> you<00:03:46.290> know<00:03:46.320> and<00:03:46.560> output<00:03:46.860> to<00:03:47.010> my<00:03:47.130> second

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:47.520

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.230 
you've got actually got to have software

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:56.510 
you've got actually got to have software
that<00:03:54.200> that<00:03:55.200> responds<00:03:55.770> to<00:03:55.830> this<00:03:56.040> thing<00:03:56.310> like

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:56.520 
that that responds to this thing like

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:58.480 
that that responds to this thing like
for<00:03:56.760> instance<00:03:56.850> in<00:03:57.270> After<00:03:57.810> Effects<00:03:58.200> or

that or a second monitor you can drag
windows<00:04:08.970> in<00:04:09.209> it's<00:04:09.830> basically<00:04:10.830> just<00:04:11.160> an<00:04:11.310> output

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:19.159 
Premiere and there's only a few pieces
of<00:04:17.790> software<00:04:18.150> that<00:04:18.270> actually<00:04:18.660> recognized

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:19.169 
of software that actually recognized

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:20.340 
of software that actually recognized
this<00:04:19.440> thing

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:20.350 
this thing

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:23.100 
this thing
it<00:04:20.800> like<00:04:21.310> for<00:04:21.700> instance<00:04:22.000> if<00:04:22.150> your<00:04:22.270> vjing<00:04:22.870> and

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:23.110 
it like for instance if your vjing and

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:25.770 
it like for instance if your vjing and
you<00:04:23.170> want<00:04:23.320> to<00:04:23.380> have<00:04:23.470> a<00:04:23.530> camera<00:04:23.830> in<00:04:24.450> and<00:04:25.450> then

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:27.370 
play with it and put in a different

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:29.370 
play with it and put in a different
output<00:04:27.520> that<00:04:27.940> doesn't<00:04:28.300> work<00:04:28.450> it<00:04:28.690> won't<00:04:29.110> do

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:29.380

worked last time so it should work again
this<00:04:46.330> time<00:04:46.630> exactly<00:04:47.530> the<00:04:47.800> same<00:04:48.990> theoretically

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:49.990 
this time exactly the same theoretically

signal going into it and happens to pick

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:39.029 
signal going into it and happens to pick
it<00:06:37.750> up<00:06:37.870> let's<00:06:38.080> have<00:06:38.199> a<00:06:38.289> look<00:06:38.470> just<00:06:38.770> bear<00:06:39.009> with

00:06:39.029 --> 00:06:39.039 
it up let's have a look just bear with

00:06:39.039 --> 00:06:41.580 
it up let's have a look just bear with
me<00:06:39.250> well<00:06:39.550> I<00:06:39.580> plug<00:06:39.940> this<00:06:40.150> thing<00:06:40.210> in<00:06:40.600> let's<00:06:41.410> see

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:41.590 
me well I plug this thing in let's see

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:43.860 
me well I plug this thing in let's see
if<00:06:41.680> we<00:06:41.770> get<00:06:41.919> okay<00:06:42.520> beautiful<00:06:43.150> there's<00:06:43.780> a

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:43.870 
if we get okay beautiful there's a

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:49.439 
if we get okay beautiful there's a
signal<00:06:44.320> and<00:06:45.930> see<00:06:47.190> it's<00:06:48.190> up<00:06:48.310> on<00:06:48.460> the<00:06:48.520> up<00:06:49.120> on<00:06:49.300> the

00:06:49.439 --> 00:06:49.449 
signal and see it's up on the up on the

00:06:49.449 --> 00:06:53.580 
signal and see it's up on the up on the
big<00:06:49.600> screen<00:06:50.020> and<00:06:50.910> so<00:06:51.910> now<00:06:52.210> we'll<00:06:53.169> just<00:06:53.380> test

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:53.590 
big screen and so now we'll just test

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:57.090 
big screen and so now we'll just test
that<00:06:53.800> same<00:06:54.250> signal<00:06:55.620> put<00:06:56.620> the<00:06:56.740> camera<00:06:57.070> down

00:06:57.090 --> 00:06:57.100 
that same signal put the camera down

00:06:57.100 --> 00:07:01.620 
that same signal put the camera down
here<00:06:58.050> and<00:06:59.050> we'll<00:06:59.979> put<00:07:00.220> that<00:07:00.400> same<00:07:00.759> signal<00:07:01.270> that

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:01.630 
here and we'll put that same signal that

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:02.540 
here and we'll put that same signal that
just<00:07:01.810> went<00:07:01.960> into<00:07:02.050> the<00:07:02.229> television

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:02.550 
just went into the television

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:08.510 
just went into the television
successfully<00:07:04.050> into<00:07:05.050> the<00:07:05.380> video<00:07:06.039> in<00:07:06.490> the

00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:08.520 
successfully into the video in the

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:11.850 
successfully into the video in the
composite<00:07:09.520> there<00:07:09.759> on<00:07:09.940> the<00:07:10.180> card<00:07:10.479> and<00:07:11.139> let's

00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:11.860 
composite there on the card and let's

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:16.129 
composite there on the card and let's
see<00:07:12.099> if<00:07:12.190> we<00:07:12.370> have<00:07:12.550> any<00:07:12.729> luck<00:07:13.000> with<00:07:13.270> that<00:07:13.560> so

00:07:16.129 --> 00:07:16.139 
see if we have any luck with that so

00:07:16.139 --> 00:07:19.290 
see if we have any luck with that so
again<00:07:17.139> we<00:07:17.860> need<00:07:18.039> to<00:07:18.099> go<00:07:18.400> into<00:07:18.610> the<00:07:18.880> system

00:07:19.290 --> 00:07:19.300 
again we need to go into the system

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:22.950 
again we need to go into the system
preferences<00:07:19.870> and<00:07:20.669> check<00:07:21.669> the<00:07:21.910> black<00:07:22.300> magic

00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:22.960 
preferences and check the black magic

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:28.980 
preferences and check the black magic
design<00:07:23.490> driver<00:07:24.490> is<00:07:25.000> set<00:07:25.479> to<00:07:26.970> a<00:07:27.990> composite

00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:28.990 
design driver is set to a composite

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:32.219 
design driver is set to a composite
video<00:07:29.169> and<00:07:29.669> analog<00:07:30.669> in<00:07:30.880> and<00:07:31.150> it's<00:07:31.360> set<00:07:31.539> to<00:07:31.570> pal

00:07:32.219 --> 00:07:32.229 
video and analog in and it's set to pal

00:07:32.229 --> 00:07:36.540 
video and analog in and it's set to pal
and<00:07:32.910> we<00:07:33.910> go<00:07:34.150> into<00:07:34.570> the<00:07:34.720> black<00:07:34.990> magic<00:07:35.530> a<00:07:35.979> media

00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:36.550 
and we go into the black magic a media

00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:39.180 
and we go into the black magic a media
Express<00:07:37.090> and<00:07:37.500> we<00:07:38.500> can<00:07:38.650> see<00:07:38.889> it's<00:07:39.039> already

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:39.190 
Express and we can see it's already

00:07:39.190 --> 00:07:41.790 
Express and we can see it's already
seeing<00:07:39.610> something<00:07:39.909> there<00:07:40.360> so<00:07:41.050> make<00:07:41.260> sure<00:07:41.289> if

00:07:41.790 --> 00:07:41.800 
seeing something there so make sure if

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:45.810 
seeing something there so make sure if
that's<00:07:42.039> set<00:07:42.280> to<00:07:42.310> pal<00:07:42.699> and<00:07:44.099> what<00:07:45.099> have<00:07:45.220> we<00:07:45.250> got<00:07:45.550> I

00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:45.820 
that's set to pal and what have we got I

00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:47.580 
that's set to pal and what have we got I
think<00:07:46.120> that<00:07:46.570> you're<00:07:46.720> pretty<00:07:46.960> familiar<00:07:47.169> with

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:47.590 
think that you're pretty familiar with

00:07:47.590 --> 00:07:52.320 
think that you're pretty familiar with
this<00:07:47.710> scenario<00:07:47.949> now<00:07:48.780> flashing<00:07:49.780> frames<00:07:50.849> I<00:07:51.849> can

00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:52.330 
this scenario now flashing frames I can

00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:54.779 
this scenario now flashing frames I can
run<00:07:52.539> it<00:07:52.659> through<00:07:52.810> my<00:07:53.020> DVD<00:07:53.560> player<00:07:53.919> and<00:07:54.190> that

00:07:54.779 --> 00:07:54.789 
run it through my DVD player and that

00:07:54.789 --> 00:07:56.820 
run it through my DVD player and that
acts<00:07:55.060> as<00:07:55.240> a<00:07:55.300> time<00:07:55.599> base<00:07:55.840> corrector<00:07:55.870> and<00:07:56.620> then<00:07:56.740> I

00:07:56.820 --> 00:07:56.830 
acts as a time base corrector and then I

00:07:56.830 --> 00:07:59.760 
acts as a time base corrector and then I
can<00:07:57.010> get<00:07:57.190> a<00:07:57.430> decent<00:07:58.150> signal<00:07:58.570> but<00:07:58.990> the<00:07:59.139> need<00:07:59.590> to

00:07:59.760 --> 00:07:59.770 
can get a decent signal but the need to

00:07:59.770 --> 00:08:01.920 
can get a decent signal but the need to
have<00:07:59.919> to<00:08:00.070> do<00:08:00.250> that<00:08:00.520> is<00:08:00.930> completely

00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:01.930 
have to do that is completely

00:08:01.930 --> 00:08:05.669 
have to do that is completely
frustrating<00:08:02.740> to<00:08:02.889> be<00:08:02.919> quite<00:08:03.310> honest
