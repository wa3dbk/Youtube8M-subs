00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:26.580
 we are a little less than a month away from 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.620
 sections where they will be chosen 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.650
 municipal presidents deputies 

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:33.210
 local and federal senators governor 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.910
 of our state and president of the 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.680
 republica and you can make a forecast 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.080
 of what the electoral context will be like in 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.420
 matter of democracy the forecast is 

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:44.430
 simple before the elections we will have 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.830
 political campaigns with few proposals 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.110
 many offers on the air and few 

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:51.120
 commitments campaigns in which 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.440
 will upholster all municipalities with 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.020
 ads for job applicants 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.830
 public but little will be known about the plan 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:00.450
 work of those aspirants in order 

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:03.070
 political marketing campaigns and not 

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:05.290
 political campaigns properly 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:07.570
 this along with other elements of the 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:09.850
 which I will speak later will give as 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:12.430
 result democratic elections 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:15.670
 with little representative results of 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:18.220
 public interest in other words the 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:20.320
 2012 democratic review 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:22.869
 we're going to fail him and we're going to 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:25.180
 reprobate all society parties 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:27.580
 politicians and government is going to fail 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:31.119
 mexico but above all it will fail 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:33.220
 Chiapas the government did not do in six years 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:35.080
 enough to raise the 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:37.930
 education indicators so 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:40.270
 meaningful or sowing bases so that 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:42.070
 you see him in later years we continue 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:45.310
 being an ignorant people what we 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:47.350
 makes vulnerable neither did this 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:49.780
 government enough to give it 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:52.330
 dynamism to the state economy 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:54.700
 The business sector in Chiapas is very 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:56.350
 little autonomous we have an economy like that 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.320
 with a lot of intervention and regulation 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:01.600
 government but not depending on the 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:03.549
 public interests but in terms of 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.720
 the private interests of those who two 

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:06.940
 governments 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.590
 then we will commission a process 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:10.770
 electoral with a business 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:14.680
 dependent on government and therefore 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:16.569
 manipulable in political matters as 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.670
 describes pp figueroa in an article 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:21.700
 published in August of last year in his 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:23.380
 column cafe avenue the governor has 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:25.120
 strongly intervened in 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:27.070
 internal decisions of the three 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.230
 major political parties in 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:32.650
 Chiapas so we will have matches 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:35.140
 intervened therefore submissive in 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:37.420
 few words the government that heads 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:39.760
 the sabines lawyer has governed more 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:42.340
 for the journalistic note that for the 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.959
 people of Chiapas more to vanagloriar 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:46.150
 its image at the national level and 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:48.730
 international than to build the 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:51.280
 state that we need the Chiapanecans 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:52.870
 this government has not been able or has not 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:55.659
 wanted to provide the conditions 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:58.980
 necessary for us to live in Chiapas 

00:02:55.659 --> 00:03:03.010
 democratic elections in 2012 that is 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:05.200
 the government is going to fail the exam by 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:07.620
 be complacent when not 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.790
 contrary to democratic purposes 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:11.590
 the political parties either 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:13.840
 will reach the necessary grade for 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:16.120
 approve the first of July had 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:18.819
 six years to improve their practices and 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:20.799
 they did not do it or not enough their 

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:23.680
 internal processes to choose so much 

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:25.989
 candidates as leaders continue to follow 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:28.959
 being unclear and therefore few 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:31.239
 little democratic their alliances that 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:33.310
 argue only in some instances of 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:36.340
 the political competition continue 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:38.680
 evidencing his pragmatism has not been 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:40.569
 worried no political party in 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:43.450
 make clear their lines of thought and 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:45.010
 of work in Chiapas not left 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:46.780
 right or center 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:49.299
 in Chiapas there are political parties that 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:51.340
 they exchange candidates and leaders and 

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:53.980
 according to figueroa's text they have a 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:56.650
 common boss 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:58.659
 in Chiapas there is no public representation 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:00.819
 but representation of interests 

00:03:58.659 --> 00:04:03.370
 private in chiapas new ideology 

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:05.530
 policy but structures that are sold 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:07.780
 to the highest bidder who auction their 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:12.190
 cooperation elections after elections 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:14.890
 in the political market the first bread the 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:16.870
 pr of each of the seven parties 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:20.799
 politicians to that Mexicans will 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:23.979
 we invest only in 2010 3 thousand 12 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:26.410
 million pesos will fail in the exam 

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:28.630
 next July for not worrying about 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:31.270
 represent them by continuing to compete 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:33.550
 by votes and positions by seats and 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:37.240
 seats and not provide innovative projects 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:40.330
 and sustainable and now 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:43.389
 we have reached the most painful part the 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:45.699
 2012 democratic review 

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:47.090
 we're going to fail the citizens 

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:49.699
 Chiapanecos 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:52.520
 we're going to fail him for shutting us up and 

00:04:49.699 --> 00:04:54.440
 obey without questioning for aligning ourselves 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:57.590
 parties that do not align with the interest 

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:59.900
 public for one demand enough for 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:02.600
 settle for the least worse by 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:05.660
 justify the unjustifiable by little 

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:08.210
 informed by being little aware of 

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:11.060
 our own situation by little united 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:13.729
 uncritical, the exam is going to 

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:16.520
 failing everyone will fail him the 

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:18.830
 teacher and the student of low quality the 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:21.500
 businessman and the job and the employee 

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:23.600
 inefficient that the one who dodged 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:26.300
 taxes and the one that spent them badly or 

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:28.490
 he threw us into his pocket the one who stole his 

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:31.130
 employer and the one that stole the town the one 

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:33.530
 paid a bite and the one that he accepted the 

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:35.270
 businessman who needed to be breastfed 

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:37.669
 by government and the government that charged him 

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:39.800
 face the old milk that does not give 

00:05:37.669 --> 00:05:42.080
 opportunity for young people and the young 

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:43.669
 was not able to offer anything new the 

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:46.190
 university that offered in degrees 

00:05:43.669 --> 00:05:47.400
 easy and the student who was satisfied 

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:49.229
 with them 

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:51.690
 rural leader who sold votes for 

00:05:49.229 --> 00:05:55.110
 positions and the candidate who bought them 

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:57.479
 those hauled and loaders those who 

00:05:55.110 --> 00:06:00.120
 they did poor public works and 

00:05:57.479 --> 00:06:02.880
 those who govern them and all that 

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:06.539
 we allow all this to happen in six 

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:08.550
 years are not given the conditions that 

00:06:06.539 --> 00:06:10.470
 needs democracy to guarantee 

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:11.820
 Elections where interest is expressed 

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:13.560
 public 

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:16.440
 this is not something that we can solve 

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:18.480
 for July is something that is built to 

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:21.660
 through time with the effort of 

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:24.450
 every day now well it's not time to 

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:26.280
 anticipatory whining is true 

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:27.900
 we will have a failing grade in 

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:30.180
 As far as democracy is concerned in the 

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:32.270
 next elections but we do not 

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:35.160
 We are used to making the donkey of the group 

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:38.490
 chiapas the always exploited the always 

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:40.160
 marginalized the always forgotten is moment 

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:45.270
 to start working for the exam 

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:47.490
 2018 2021 2024 it 's time to raise the 

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:49.800
 voice with argued criticism and with 

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:53.610
 proposals in the words of the doctor 

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:56.730
 dresser I quote textual the office of being a 

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:58.350
 good citizen part of the commitment of 

00:06:56.730 --> 00:07:01.670
 live anchored in outrage 

00:06:58.350 --> 00:07:03.320
 permanent criticizing proposing 

00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:05.139
 shaking 

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:07.719
 Chiapaneco 

00:07:05.139 --> 00:07:10.120
 It's time to pay taxes and claim 

00:07:07.719 --> 00:07:12.370
 its good use is a moment of not giving 

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:14.650
 bitten and not tolerate the abuses of 

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:16.479
 transit agents to attend the 

00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:19.240
 school and denounce the teacher who does not 

00:07:16.479 --> 00:07:21.219
 make good university students and 

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:23.529
 demand that the education they offer you 

00:07:21.219 --> 00:07:26.710
 make you a competitive professional in 

00:07:23.529 --> 00:07:29.650
 the labor market and a free thinker is 

00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:32.590
 time to go to the ballot box and go to vote is 

00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:35.229
 time to fulfill obligations and demand 

00:07:32.590 --> 00:07:38.439
 rights to be quality citizens 

00:07:35.229 --> 00:07:41.560
 to be able to one day choose rulers 

00:07:38.439 --> 00:07:44.229
 of quality is time to raise your voice and 

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:46.960
 lift the strong and lift the together and 

00:07:44.229 --> 00:07:50.590
 criticize and propose and denounce and 

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:52.659
 writing reading and working is time to 

00:07:50.590 --> 00:07:55.110
 choose the future we want and walk 

00:07:52.659 --> 00:07:55.110
 to him
