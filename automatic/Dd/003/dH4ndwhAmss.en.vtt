 the us system is again in the spotlight 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.480
 however this time it is not related 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.150
 suspected terrorists in recent 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.889
 The UN report states that 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:15.719
 the only country in the world where children 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.990
 imprisoned for life 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.789
 without the right to parole that 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.330
 some regard as deadly 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.609
 sentence 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:30.150
 In addition, this practice is prohibited immediately 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:31.949
 I consider several international norms 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.480
 that the imprisonment of children is 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.040
 extreme measure at which must 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.960
 minimum terms are used and 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.960
 strictly observe the interests of the child 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:44.760
 according to the sentence in project 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.680
 about two and a half thousand people on 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.719
 the moment is serving a life sentence 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.199
 for the crime they committed 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:54.149
 being kids 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:56.250
 even if the child did not commit murder 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.289
 was only an accomplice of crime all 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.579
 gang members can get the same 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.829
 premature punishment 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.539

 domini dolls by pen was fifteen years old 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.979
 when in 2002 he was sentenced to 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:13.200
 life imprisonment for beating up 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.880
 the death of another teen his mother 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.250
 believes that the judiciary should 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.930
 rehabilitate children and not 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:23.100
 doom them to life and death for 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:25.320
 bars I don't want to be punished 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.040
 I recognize that he must answer for 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.470
 deed 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.490
 but I don't want him to ruin his life 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.180
 behind bars 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.740
 In 2012, the US Supreme Court banned 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.900
 forced life sentence 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:40.020
 no pardon for children 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:42.329
 under 18 years old as contradictory 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.670
 constitution nonetheless at the level 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.380
 states judges theoretically still 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.380
 may have the right to give children 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.119
 life imprisonment 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:53.340
 if america says so much about what 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:55.049
 is the greatest country in the world 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.390
 why is this practice still 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:58.890
 there is a channel rt contacted 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.079
 US Department of Justice and 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.969
 inquired what actions the department 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:05.070
 going to take what you lead 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:06.719
