1-nil<00:02:55.709> up<00:02:55.860> and<00:02:56.010> that<00:02:56.100> was<00:02:56.190> a<00:02:56.220> nice<00:02:56.400> header

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
1-nil up and that was a nice header

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.390 
1-nil up and that was a nice header

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
minutes later we head the ball against

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.530 
minutes later we head the ball against
the<00:03:01.739> bar<00:03:01.950> and<00:03:02.190> then<00:03:02.280> hula<00:03:02.550> is<00:03:02.730> there<00:03:02.940> to<00:03:03.090> not<00:03:03.300> in
