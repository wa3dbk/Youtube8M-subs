which shoots when the sound goes above
60<00:00:45.580> decibels<00:00:46.059> so<00:00:46.989> it<00:00:47.110> starts<00:00:47.440> recording<00:00:47.530> them

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:49.780 
60 decibels so it starts recording them

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:53.100 
60 decibels so it starts recording them
as<00:00:49.870> we<00:00:50.649> open<00:00:50.890> up<00:00:51.190> the<00:00:51.309> box<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:52.600> first<00:00:52.930> thing
